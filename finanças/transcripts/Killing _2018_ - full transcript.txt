A Kaijyu Theater production A film by Shinya Tsukamoto Sousuke Ikematsu Yu Aoi KILLING Ichisuke! Last call for lunch! Come now or you'll miss your chance! Damn! Can we train after lunch, Mokunoshin? You should keep some of your strength for the harvest. Here. Are you leaving soon, sir? Yes. I'm sorry... It's okay. A samurai shouldn't worry about us farmers. You've helped us more than enough. We'll make do. We all get a day off tomorrow. I hope you rest well. Thank you for your help. Thank you for letting me stay. Off to Edo? I guess so. It's time I got on my way. Do you have to? Yes. For 250 years us samurai have laid low. It's time for me to prove my worth. Ichisuke envies you. He wishes he was a samurai so he could fight too. Will you die? What? No, I won't. Farmers don't fight in wars so don't mislead my brother. I guess farmers might be drafted at the end of a war... There's a duel! Let's go and watch. I'll stay here. You should see it! Come on, before it ends! Ichisuke, we're going. Now! It's a ladybug's instinct to climb upward until they reach the top, then they fly to heaven. It has 7 spots. That's rare. They're usually in grasslands. A 7-spotted ladybug? What's it doing here? It's you... I found one with 2 spots when I was a child. It was red, not one of those black ladybugs. Maybe it was a dream... I saw your duel, sir. You were lightning quick... I am Jirozaemon Sawamura. I'm also a samurai with no master. I've been observing you two. Would you like to accompany me to Edo? I'm putting together a warrior squad to serve the Shogun. Two men went ahead of me. I need at least 3 more men before we go to fight in Kyoto. We have no time to waste. Is it urgent? Yes. I spent too much time looking for good men. I am Mokunoshin Tsuzuki. Good. So you're in. How about you? Me? But I'm not... I judge people by their skills not by class. - Great! - Shut up, kid! You don't know who's fighting! - I do. - Tell me then. It's that lord and... I'll tell you later. Speak to your parents. But you're a reserve. If I can't find any more samurai I'll ask you to join us. If you spar with Mr. Tsuzuki, you must be good. Our job will be to maintain peace. Finally us wandering samurai won't be hungry anymore. I can feed you all you want... I'll go look some more. But maybe I can call it a day. Will you die? No, I won't. Whoa, it's cold! If you intend to go... you need to do more work first. No, I'm good enough to be useful. I'm saying this for your benefit. Are you sure? Maybe you're ashamed of fighting alongside a farmer. That's not it. What is it, Kahei? They're looking this way! They're bad news. What are the doing here? You'd better not make eye contact. Hurry! I am Mokunoshin Tsuzuki. And you're a samurai? I'm boarding with the farmers there. What's your problem? The farmers need workers if that's what you want. They'll be harvesting soon. Don't be silly. Listen. We only make trouble for people who deserve it. So what is it about us that scares villagers? Your faces. If you looked friendlier, they'd welcome you. There was a gang who threatened and stole from some townsfolk. So we decided to threaten the gang in turn and stole the loot they'd taken from the townsfolk. Then did you return it to them? Why should we? We didn't because we're not the authorities. Finders, keepers. I heard that the townsfolk were massacred. That wasn't us. That's so inhumane. A corrupt village headman had his house set on fire and all his harvest stolen. I don't remember that... Oh yeah we did that! I told you! We only make trouble for those who do bad things. They should be arrested... Can't you stay until those men go away? We let you stay as protection against threats like this... And now our boy wants to go to Edo. I'm going! They're not that bad. Don't dismiss them if they approach you for work. It's me, Sawamura. We're leaving tomorrow at daybreak. I wanted more men but we're out of time. I want you to join us. Did you speak to your father? I appreciate all that you've done for me. I wish I could have helped harvest the crop. You've done enough. Thank you for your help, sir. I wish you well on your journey. Thank you. We'll leave tomorrow instead. He'll be fine if we take rests. Right? No. It wouldn't be good if he was ill on arrival. Let's play it safe. Why now? What's got you all agitated? The farmer's pretending to be a samurai... Hey, peasant! Take it easy. Anywhere else hurt? It's bad enough! They'll come back for more trouble. I wish they'd go already. Ichisuke, you're one of my men now. I can't allow them to harass one of my men. Don't worry. I'll just take a look. Some of them may be good swordsmen. This is such a joke. You and my brother should be in Edo not lying in pain. What happened to Ichisuke? Those outlaws mocked him and pushed him in a paddy, so he fought back. So they beat him up. Is he hurt badly? If he was I wouldn't be here chatting with you! Good... Good? What are you saying? He was beaten up! What's good about that? I see your point. If those outlaws were serious he would be dead. And I doubt that samurai. You know, Sawamura? I was impressed when he said that he'd stand by his men. But then he talked about recruiting them. What's that? The samurai fought the outlaws! One escaped but he won't be able to do anything. We can sleep peacefully! I knew he was big time. He carried it off! Oh no... Oh no... Oh no... Mr. Sawamura. We kept this rice for a special occasion. Eat all you can. Thanks to you, we can work in the paddies without fear. It's almost frightening that you beat them! I wish I'd been there. Ichisuke. Ichisuke. What? Can you get his bowl? Do it yourself! When an official is sent to investigate, you'll be praised. I'm so glad. I guess your search for other men is over? Why don't you stay over? No, thank you. I'm boarding nearby. Oh, what a shame. You're Yu? Yes. How is Tsuzuki? Good... I mean, he still needs to rest. So there are more of them... I knew they were nothing but trouble. Damn... I recognized one of them. It was the survivor. He brought in other outlaws. He screamed, "Where is Sawamura?" "I'll kill anyone who hides him!" When they saw us I thought they'd kill us. They had a horrible look in their eyes. Avenge his death... Avenge his death! You made him think he was up to it... I'll go. No! I want him to go. Just him... While you were sleeping all day Ichisuke was... Avenge his death. I beg you not to pursue this any more. I beg you. What's that? You don't fight when you have to! You're going to Edo to kill people, aren't you? Is your sword decorative? We started the trouble. No, they harassed Ichisuke! That doesn't count. If we avenged his death they'd retaliate. We shouldn't do the same thing. But Ichisuke... What about him? And what about our parents? Their resentment will keep them from heaven! You should stay. Please don't do this. I beg you. Do you grasp the reality of our mission to Edo and Kyoto? Get ready. Show me your worth. Where did that samurai, Sawamura, go? Everyone's hiding him. Mokunoshin! What are you up to? Go on, finish me off. You'll soon bleed to death so reflect on your life. When you come to hell I'll give you time to reflect on your damn life. Reflect on your life a little. It fell... It fell again. I didn't expect it to fall... Mokunoshin Tsuzuki. You like him? He has a very important job to do. We must... We must go before we lose the chance... I can hardly move. I shouldn't have let them hurt me... It's me. We'll leave before it's too late. Tomorrow at daybreak. Count me out. I can't do it... No. You'll come with me. I'll come for you tomorrow morning. Forget what happened here. We're up against something far greater. If you refuse to come I'll kill you. Tell me... Mr. Sawamura, I don't get how you... kill so easily. How can you? I want to... I want to be able to kill. I want to be able to kill. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Hey, Tzusuki! Let's not go together! I'm going to kill you unless you kill me first! The first kill is the hardest. If you can't kill, your sword is worthless. You hear me, Tsuzuki? Go to Edo if you win! You hear me? Why? Why are you obsessed with him? Why? If he uses all his might... beating him will prove my worth. Then I could serve the Shogun with pride. Good. I'm better. I found it. Hey! Tsuzuki! A 2-spotted ladybug. And it's a red one... It's a ladybug's instinct to climb upward... until they reach the top, then they fly to heaven. Why this? What does it mean? Tsuzuki. Tsuzuki. Please don't... Please don't. Please stop! Please stop!
