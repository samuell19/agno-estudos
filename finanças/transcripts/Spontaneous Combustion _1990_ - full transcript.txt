Brian, Peggy... Your song again. Hey, we should make that the official project anthem. We're with you out there. In spirit. Congratulations. And good luck. You okay, sweetie? Take a deep breath. Okay. Okay, Brian, we're ready to start this final countdown. T-minus 90 seconds and counting. Brian, are you and Peggy hooked up to the accelerator? - Yes. - Alright, it's time to administer your injections. Okay. All set, kids? - Y-yeah, hold on. - Alright, here we go. Now there's no turning back; we're committed. Okay, Brian, Peggy... Very soon. Ready now. Ready. Good luck, mein children. I love you. God be with you. T-minus 60 seconds. Goggles on. Last chance. T-minus 30... 29... 28... 27... 26... 25... 24... 23... 22... 21... 20... 19... 18... 17... 16... Brian! I'm so scared! It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. - I did it for us, baby. - 9... 8... 7... - I love you. - I love you too. 5... 4... 3... 2... One... zero. Come on, come on. God dammit! Something's wrong. It's gotta be a misfire. Check the firing circuits. It's probably the detonator. - Brian! - Don't look at it! Don't look at it! A new tool has been given mankind. But in the wrong hands, one of unimaginable destructive power. And that is why we must remain ever vigilant, ever prepared. Project Sampson! This shelter's guaranteed to take the anxiety out of the atomic age. Modern atomic technologies has made sure it's got it all: Special air filtration and circulating systems, food and survival supplies for seven days, and can this baby take it! Reinforced steel. 6 inches of corrugated lead. 3 feet of concrete, and 20 feet underground. It can a near direct hit from a 10 megaton hydrogen bomb and laugh it off. All that, and a new anti-radiation project so top secret, even the President has to ask for clearance. That's how we build them in the U.S. of A... Strong. Strong enough to protect the heroes of our story. National heroes, Brian and Peggy Bell, just 20 feet underground and 200 yards away from the Samson tower. Meet Brian and Peggy Bell, America's first nuclear family. American heroes for America's future. Brian and Peggy are the most important part of the patriotic team, leading the way in peacetime testings, to produce jobs, insure our security, and harness the power of the atom. And comes the day, the day of Samson, and Brian and Peggy ride the nuclear storm for us, to make our future safe. Cleansing process complete. No signs of radiant energy. Success! And America moves forward again. In the forefront of technology and progress. And what of Brian and Peggy? What about the heroes of our story? It's off to their new home and new life in Phoenix, Arizona, where Brian will continue his important work in atomic research, while Peggy sets up housekeeping. So long, Brian and Peggy. America salutes you. - Thank you, Major. - The latest tests are negative! Absolutely no trace of mercury. And the level of radiation in the bone marrow- -is completely within the normal range! Clean isolation period is over! - The vaccine worked! - Well, that was excellent. That was just outstanding. You know, we're very, very proud of you two. And you're gonna be very famous in the near future. This little news reel has an unprecedented release, ladies and gentleme, in 1500 theaters from coast to coast. Ladies and gentlemen, join me, please. in a toast... to Brian and Peggy... ...America's first nuclear family. It's gonna be great, baby. Brian, Peggy... Why don't you come with me? There's somebody over there I'd like very much for you to meet. - Yes, sir. - Right this way. - Now, you know the General? - Yes, sir, General. Mr. and Mrs. Bell, may I present Lewis Olander. He's the chairman of Modern Atomic Technologies, and Brian, that makes him your new boss. How do you do? Very well, thank you. Very well. How in God's name could she get pregnant? You put a man and a woman alone underground, what do you expect them to do, play Parcheesi? I don't think that's the issue any longer. The question at hand is: What do we do about it? You mean an abortion? I don't know. That makes me awfully uneasy. I think it's probably advisable, under the circumstances. Mr. Orlander? What do you think? A beautiful boy. Oh! - Oh, honey, you did it! - Brian, he is so beautiful. Well, what'd you expect? Look at his mom. God, look at this room! Where'd all this come from? Guess we have a lot of friends, huh? Hi. Well... here's mine. - And they are the most beautiful. - Oh, darling. How ya doin', you doin' okay? - Oh, yes. - You look wonderful. I love you so much. What's in the red box? This is David's first present. Brian! - It is so beautiful! - Wait, look at this. Isn't it amazing what they're dong with plastic? Oh, Brian. His, uh, vital signs are all perfect. There's no signs of radiation, and, uh, he's running a fever, though. About 100 degrees. Is that anything to worry about, Doctor? No, not really, it's, uh, probably just a low-grade infection. We'll have him watched. Some people actually have permanently high temperatures, he could just be one of those. Is that a bruise on the child's hand? It's a birthmark. Actually, it's the only abnormality we could find. - It's a perfect circle. - A perfect abnormality. Looks like a tattoo! Well, it's August 6th. It's a helluva birthday for that little guy, isn't it? What do you mean? Well, Doctor, today is the 10th anniversary of the day we dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. That's pretty funny, ain't it? Let's go see your mommy. ♪ Sleep, baby, sleep in my arms. ♪ ♪ You're mommy's little boo. ♪ ♪ Daddy will keep you safe from harm. ♪ ♪ Our love will save the world. ♪ ♪ Sleep, baby, sleep in my arms. ♪ Mommy's singing. Mommy's singing. Oh, you are still a little warm. I think we'd best take her temperature again. - Mm! Uhm! - Oh, Peggy! - Honey, did it break? - Don't swallow, don't swallow any mercury. - Here. - Wait, wait, wait. - Spit it out. There you go. - Everything out. No glass. Wait a minute. Wash your mouth. Yeah, don't swallow any mercury. Wash it all out. - You okay? Rinse it out. - Don't swallow. - Alright? - Did you get it all? - Okay. - I'm fine. Careful. I got some on me. Baby. Bye, bye. Mommy loves you so much. Bye, bye. Bye, bye. I refuse to believe someone did not realize that this potential existed! Well, you're welcome to believe whatever you like, Dr. Mueller. The fact of the matter is, we did not. And you can kindly spare us your indignation. As I recall, you were a member of this team. It's unbelievable. All the moisture is gone, even the marrow. It would take a temperature of 6000 degrees centigrade to do something like this. It's the cleanest kill I ever saw. Well, ladies and gentlemen, all that's very interesting, but it's not what I'm concerned with! What I care about is what caused this, and can it be repeated? Now, let's get hot and find some answers. Was there any plastic in the area? - This could affect it. - Yes. It all melted. - How did you know? - This is Dr. Vandenmeer. I've asked him to join us tonight. How do you do? The body's burned from the inside with fury. And the sound... the sound like angel's scream. The plastic melts. Everything else remains with little or no damage. The covers, clothing, articles made of cotton are particularly invulnerable. The human body, you see, is the most complex electrically sparked combustion engine we know of. It is difficult for us to comprehend spontaneous combustion. We would not have the same reaction to a radio catching fire. SHC is a naturally occurring phenomenon, but the odds of it striking any particular individual are millions to one. I believe the complexities of the vaccines your subjects were given, combined with radiation from the blast dramatically reduced those odds to one to one. Yes. The fire from heaven was certainly here today. S, H, C. Spontaneous Human Combustion. "Why have my sisters husbands, if they say they love you all?" " Haply, when I shall wed, that lord whose hand must take my..." "...plight shall carry. Half my love with him, half my care and duty." "Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters. To love my father all." - "But goes thy heart with this?" - "Ay, my good lord." - "So young..." - "So young and so untender?" - "So young, my lord, and true." - "Let it be so." - "Thy truth then be thy flower." - Dower. "As by the sacred radiance of the sun..." "By all the operation of the orbs from whom we do exist and cease to be..." "I here disclaim all paternal care, propinquity, and property of blood, and as a stranger to my heart and me, hold thee from this for ever." - That was awful! - Give him the hook. What are you talking about? That was great stuff. In your dreams. Really, Mr. Kramer, you stink. Gosh, I guess this means I don't get the part. Wait a minute. Let's get a second opinion on this. Well, what do you think? Uhh... Don't give up your dayjob. So, can I take you out to lunch for your birthday? I'm dying to give you your present. Can't. Gotta go do battle with Mata Hari. Just when we agree to sell the house, she leases it out. - Bitch. - Sam! Gee! You gonna talk that bad about me after we're married and divorced and I take you the cleaners, too? No, you're worse. - What'd you get me for my birthday? - Uhmm... It's a surprise. - Tell me anyway! - I don't know. Do you promise you're gonna like it? I promise. I promise. Well... I had Dr. Persons do your charts. Sam! Don't do that, come on. You know, I respect your interests, I don't see why you can't respect mine. I'm sorry. I woke up feeling a little sick. I've had a headache all morning. And I really am interested. What does it say, is it a good one? - Is what a good one? - My chart. Yes, it is. It says that you're a very lucky man with a purpose. Hm. You know, I think you do have a fever. See? Listen... - Why don't you call me after school? - Yes? And then you can take me out to dinner for my birthday. Students and faculty, only ten minutes ago the Trinidad Beach Nuclear Power Plant received it's core, making today its official birthday. It goes online at midnight. Are you pro or are you con? Students For Nuclear Logic will meet this afternoon, in the auditorum at 3 o'clock, while Students for a Safe and Sane Environment are organizing a quiet demonstration to take place outside the gates of the nuclear plant site beginning at 8 o'clock. Be sure to let both points of view go on record. Petitions both for and against the Trinidad Beach facility are ready to be signed. Thank you. Boo! Can I help you? Do you go to school here? I was... Thank you. Excuse me, do you have a reservation? Oh, no, no. - Hi. - Hello, Sam. Hello, John. How ya doin', fella? How ya feelin'? Migraine still bothering you? Why do you always do that? You are not my doctor anymore. - Occupational habit. - John and I just bumped into each other. You used to "bump" into each other a lot when we were married, too. - Well, I've gotta be running along. - Sit down, sit down. You guys can do whatever the hell you want, we've been divorced for two years. I really gotta go, Sam. I'll talk to you soon, Rachel. It's good to see you again, Sam. - You hate him, don't you? - Quite the contrary. I mean, he did me a favor. - Charming as ever. - Look... I didn't invite him. I mean, who... Don't know, water under the bridge. You've already eaten. I thought this was a lunch date. I'm sorry, I couldn't wait any longer. And John was hungry, so we went ahead. But I'm on time. Besides, Grandfather's picking me up any minute. How is the old geezer? I miss him a lot. He asks about you all the time. Little orphan boy. You know, if you had taken about half as much interest in me as your grandfather, just... Waiter! Could we have the check, please? Why, dessert? No, I just could not possibly squeeze another thing in. So, tell me... How's your new girlfriend? Been together a while now. About three months. We have a lot in common. No surprises, that's the best part. Oh, Sam... Did you hear about Amy Whitaker? She died last night. What? How is that possible? I mean, I was only with her last night. God, I-I really feel guilty, I mean, we had a terrible fight. She was gloating about Trinidad, and I got so mad I could've killed her, and now she's dead. And I-I never had a chance to make peace with her. Oh, the driver's here. Waiter! - Can we have the check, please? - Just one second, dear. Sam, be a dear and take care of that, okay? Why don't you come out and say hello to Grandfather? It'd mean a lot to him. Hello, Lew. Sam! Oh, so nice to see you! - How are you? - Fine. Headaches? Hey, you look great. That's a lie. But I look awful. Thanks anyway. Happy birthday, Sam! - Thank you. - Oh yes, happy birthday. Uh, Grandfather, we really have to go, I'm already late. - Amy Whitaker... - Hold on, wait a minute. Just one second. Tha-that's Amy. ...was found dead last night, an apparent victim of smoking in bed. The body was burned beyond recognition, and had to be identified by dental records. Ms. Whitaker was found by close friend and associate, Rachel Orlander, daughter of billionaire industrialist, Lewis Orlander, who serves as Chief Adviser to the board of directors of the nuclear power plant. Ironically, Ms. Whitaker's death comes on a day that should have been one of victory for her, as the controversial power plant, after a ten year battle in the courts, comes online at midnight tonight. - The memorial... - We have to go. Simon? Simon. I hope you haven't forgotten your bill? My bill? Shit. Could I have the check and a glass of water, please? Walking the check is a very serious offense, my friend. Your check is over $50, and that's a felony, pal. You know what I mean? Cops? Trinidad goes online at midnight. Isn't that exciting, Sam? - Yeah, great. - How'd you do this? I don't know, it just... burned off. Today's Monday. Dr. Simpson's here. I want him to take a look at this. - Not Dr. Simpson. - And why not, may I ask? Okay, two years ago, I have a sore throat. He tells me, that I have to have my tonsils out. - So? - So, I had them out when I was seven. Maybe they grew back. Well... Looks like you'll live. You have a slight fever, but that should pass. Yeah, when I'm dead. I beg your pardon? I've always had a fever of about 100. It used to get me out of a lot of classes when I was a kid. You teachers are as bad as the students. Everybody wants a note from the doctor. Except, you get paid when you're off. Dr. Simpson, I don't want to go home. - I didn't even-- - Do you smoke? You already asked me that, and I told you no. See, that finger looks like you burned it lighting a cigarette. That's it. That's it! I'm outta here. I have a bad enough migraine as it is. In fact, good doctor, I think I will go home. Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, Dr. Simpson. As usual, your help has been invaluable. What was that? A little... static electricity. Spontaneous combustion, oh yes. In ancient times it was called the fire from heaven, until a priest died in the 1800s. "How could it be from heaven," it was asked, "if it attacked the clergy?" - "Dr. Persons..." - Dr. Persons. - Because my husband is a fireman. - Too perfect. And he says that very often, when a person was reported as... as... As having died because they were smoking in bed, it was really spontaneous combustion. But they're, uh... not supposed to talk about it. So, the firemen aren't supposed to talk about this? He says you can always tell when it wasn't a regular fire. See, the... the whole body burns, except the feet, and-and sometimes the head. And if there's any plastic in the area, it melts. Nothing else, just the plastic. Then... what is your question? How may I help you? Well... there was another one last night. Now that's the third one he's seen this year. And, uh... he says he's heard it could be contagious, it's like a virus or something. Oh God, I'm so worried! What was this person's name? The one who died last night. Well, it was Whitaker. Amy... Amy Whitaker. - The woman from the power plant. - Amy? Spontaneous combustion? We will be back in just a few moments, and I will attempt to communicate-- Do you hold the key? Just the other side of that mystical door, of the chamber at the top of your mind... ...worth far more than gold or fame or power. - Hi. - Hello, Sam? - Lew! - Are you all right? - Yes, of course I am. - Rachel told me you burned your finger. - Is it serious? - How could Rac...? No, Lew, it's... It's nothin', it's fine. - You sure? - I'm positive. All the same, I'd like John Marsh to take a look at it. Lew, I saw him once today, that's enough. Okay? Don't worry, I'm fine. Don't be upset. I will now attempt to communicate with the recently departed spirit - of Amy Whitaker. - Hey, when am I gonna see you? If Muhammad won't come to the mountain, then the mountain will have to come to him. Will you have lunch with me on Thursday? Of course I will, I'd love to. All right, son, then I'll see you. Okay, bye, Lew. Danger. It's... very dangerous. They... I can't... Oh, I can't seem to reach the spirit at this time. Perhaps she has already been reincarnated, or... Or perhaps she is in another galaxy or dimension. Very difficult. Very. I think she must be hiding. A real trickster, this one. Well... I can see we're coming up on the hour, and it's time for the news. I certainly hope that all my good listeners... Hi, this is Lisa. I can't take your call right now, but please leave a message after the beep. Hi, sweetheart. It's me, the world's greatest actor. Where are you? I thought we were getting together. Please give me a call. I have to talk to you. WKTO News Time, 6 o'clock. In local news, the Trinidad Beach Nuclear Power Plant finally comes online tonight at midnight. Only six hours from now. A small group of peaceful but determined demonstrators have been keeping vigil for more than five days in front of the main gates of the super power facility, but so far there have been no arrests. Sam! What's the matter? Oh, Lisa, thank God. I left the keys to the apartment. Where were you? I called and I called. I told you, I had my self-hypnosis class. Then I stopped by back at school. You're not gonna believe what is going on over there. There's all this police and reporters. - Dr. Simpson died. - What? How? What happened? He burned to death. And the weird thing is, he was in the gym, in the shower, with the water running. Spontaneous human combustion? That's what one of the reporters called it. SHC. It happens all the time, he said. Are you okay? So what happened to your finger? It burned. Two people died. Two people I know burned to death, and then--and then, dang, my finger just spontaneously... I'm gonna call Dr. Persons. He's on till 8:30. "Lisa... Thanks. Love, Lew." What's this? What? I didn't know you knew Lew. What gives? I'm into older men, okay? Uh, yes, let me speak to Dr. Persons, please, it's an emergency. No, no, it can't wait. Listen, I happen to be a supporter, I sent in $75, and I--and I'd like to speak to him now. This is Dr. Persons, how may I help you? - Hello? - You talk to him. - Talk to him. - I'm going to have to go - to the next caller. - What am I supposed to say? Uhm... - Something's happening to me. - I sense danger. Terrible danger. I never knew my parents. But I saw them. I mean, I left my body, and I saw them. Just a moment. Just a moment. There is a woman. And... - She is singing. - Oh God, I think my mother's name is Peggy. How the hell do I know that? She sang to you when you were a little baby. Yes! I remember! "Save the world." I'm to use my gift. Who--who are you, young man? What is your name? David Bell. Oh my God, I have a birthmark on my hand; it's twice its normal size, it's growing! - Oh God! - Hello? It appears that we got disconnected. - I will now take... - Hello? - Oh my God, is the young man... - I have to take you to a doctor! ...still listening? With the birthmark? He must call the station immediately. I knew his parents. Brian and Peggy Bell. He may be experiencing some changes. - His life may be in danger. - Oh, I... I can see now. This singing lady... Yes, they knew you. Oh. She is crying now. Uh, but I-I must go now. I-If the young man is listening, we hope he will call back next week betwen 5 and 8:30, and we hope that all you good listeners will be back at that time too. Until then, I bid you good evening. No! Pick up, you mind-reading son of a bitch! - KTOB. - Dr. Persons! It's me, the one the woman was talking about. The program's off the air now, you'll have to call back next week. Is he there? I have to get to him. - It's an emergency. - Listen, the phone is still busy, okay? - I will hold. - No, madam. Do you have any idea where he was calling from? You understand, I couldn't give out that information even if I had it. Could you take down a message and give it to him before he leaves? Shit! Look, I'm not responsible for chasing down people for personal calls. Listen, you idiot! I don't think this is as important as your lousy snot! It's most important that I reach him. - Good evening. - This is not an ordinary situation-- Oh God! No! It's making it worse! It's making it worse, Sam! The water is like fuel! I don't know what to do! Sam! Sam! Oh, Sam! Stop! God, I'm alive. I saw my mother and father. They were trying to tell me something. Okay, we're almost there, how are you doing? I'm not gonna say this right, but I never realized it until today, but my whole life I've been alone. I mean, I've always had people around, I've been lucky in that way, but... Really, I'm alone. Except today, when all this stuff started happening, there was only one person that I really wanted to be close to. Somebody I knew that would help me with anything. I love you. - I'm so scared! - Oh my God! Oh God, Sam, it's just like your parents. - What are you talking about? - It's okay, I know how you feel. My parents burned to death, too. My parents didn't burn to death, they drowned! Where'd you get an idea like that? I don't know, I thought I heard it somewhere. From who? Who would say something like that? Lew. What is this with Lew! How do you know him? Sam... I've known him all my life. He's taking care of me, since... Since my parents died, too. That's how I know about yours. We owe him everything, Sam. If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't even know each other. - What? - I wanted to tell you. I'm sorry. He set the whole thing up. He... He got me my job at school just so that we would meet. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I wanted to. But he told me that you would be upset, and I just... I don't know, I just-- I went along with it. I'm sorry if I did the wrong thing, Sam, I love you. Help! Help! Somebody help us! Help! Call the doctor! Call the doctor right now! Hurry! Hurry! Here. His arm is on fire! In the car on the way here it started to happen again! When did this happen? I don't know, there was fire coming out of his arm! Sam? Look at me. Can you hear me? Help him, please! Un... unwrap that for me, would you, Sam? Just slip it off. Page Dr. Cagney, please. Tell him to get down to my office immediately. Take him to my office. Lisa! - It would be better if you wait here. - No, I'm coming. I would think that you of all people would know that. I'm coming! Relax, Sam. You will be fine. Put him against that wall. All right, Sam. Just give me your hand. That a boy. Just relax. You'll be feeling much better. What's that? It's nothing, Sam. Just hold still. That's it. Tell me, Sam... You taking medication? - No. - Uhm, yes, actually. He's taking some pills I gave him for his headaches. But they're not--they're not really medicine, they're homeopathic. - For migraines. - Do you have them with you? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Would you excuse me, one second? He's here. It's happening. No, sir, I disagree. It is SHC. 24 seconds or 24 hours, the result is still the same. Well, I'll handle this my way. It's time this project is ended. What the hell's going on? Who were you talking to? Sam, you know Dr. Cagney, don't you? - Yeah, but-- - Of course he does. I believe we've even 18-hole'd it together a few times. We're old friends, aren't we, Sam? Sam, I've asked Dr. Cagney to look after you. I have an important appointment I'm late for. But Marsh, I want you to be... Don't worry, Sam. You're in good hands. Lisa, you'll have to come with me. - No, no, I wanna stay here. - Please, don't worry. Dr. Cagney is an excellent physician. - Come on. - Sam, I'll be right outside. Make yourself comfortable. Why don't you watch TV? I won't be a minute. Come. We'll wait in here. - Sit. - Why can't I...? Sit. Make yourselves comfortable. I'd like to talk to you. Sir? Excuse me. Would you mind? Thank you. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Just how well do you know Samson? - Do you mean Sam? - What else could I mean? Just what is he to you? He's a friend. I'm curious, Lisa... Are your migraines getting worse? - What? - The pills you have to Sam... - Do you take them as well? - What are you talking about? How do you know about all this? I work with Mr. Orlander. I took over my father's research project, Samson, so there's absolutely no reason whatsoever for any kind of emotional crescendo. I mean, you are just a little bit hysterical, aren't you? What are you talking about? What Project Samson? Orlander led me to believe that you had... a special understanding. I know that Lew brought you here from the East Coast to look after Sam. So naturally, I assumed... Look. Lew has never mentioned you to me. ...of unexplained and unrelated deaths by fire this decade. Only two hours ago, noted radio parapsychologist Myron Gold of Laguna Beach, better known as Dr. Persons, narrowly escaped death when he was trapped in a stairwell at WKTO, while a technician, Brad Wilson, burned to death before his eyes. In other news, a rescue operation is now under way in the North Sea on the Northeastern coast of England, following the collision of two oil tankers. Information. What city, please? Yeah, I'd like to speak to Dr. Person-- I'm sorry, I would like to speak to Myron Gold, in Laguna Beach, please. The number is 341-3511. Yes, I'd like to speak to the woman that called. - Yeah. - Are you sure you got it? - It's most urgent that you call her. - Okay. - You... please. - Allright. - Call her right away. I sense danger. - Yeah. Thank you. I have to give you an injection, my friend. Don't play doctor with me, Cagney. What's in these files? This is very important. It will help lower your fever. Are you crazy? I wanna know what's in these files. That's none of your business. Please don't make this any more difficult than it is. I have to give you this injection. You're fucking trying to kill me! These charts go back to when I was a kid; I did not know Marsh until I was in college! - How'd he get them? - I don't know! You're lying! There's a chart on Lisa. Why? Tell me, Cagney, I have to know! We should have flushed you when we had a chance! You're a freak! What is taking so long? Don't worry. It'll all be over shortly. Lisa! You're coming with me. David? I'm Christina. Nina. Come in. They told me you died when you were three. Sam's not your real name, did you know that? They change your name from David to Sam after your parents died. Oh! David, what have they done to you? So, you're telling me, that they knew all along that this bomb shelter wouldn't protect them from the radiation? The shelter was simply to protect them from the blast. This was the whole point, to test the anti-radiation drug. Uhh... it was administered every day for months before the blast, to protect them and to build up this tolerance to atom sized thermites in the blood streams. Didn't they tell 'em what was going on? Yeah, wel, more or less, they did. I have something I want to show you. You come with me. I want to show you. This trunk belongs to you, Sam. Oh, God. Look! Come sit down. Ja. That's your mother. Peggy. And your father, Brian. They're my best friends, I love them so much. This was your father's birthday. His 24th. We were very happy. Yes, and you were born two weeks later. See! There were presents for you too. My God, I... I have a card just like that. Nina? I don't think the experiment's over. Oh, it's over. But they're watching me. And there's files. No. Nobody's interested. Certainly not the government. Not even Modern Technologies. They've accepted the fact that immunization to radiation is totally unreasonable. Do you mean Modern Atomic Technologies? Yeah. Yeah, they had the contracts for the shelter, and the radiation drug, and they produced the firing mechanisms for the bomb. - But that was Lew's company! - Lew? My ex-wife's grandfather, the man who's raised me since I was 12 years old! - Lew Orlander? - Yes! Whe-where did you get that watch? It was your father's watch. Look. Look at the engraving on the inside, there's a liberty bell, and two... a B, a B. Brian Bell. Your father. I gotta get--I gotta get outta here. - No, we have to talk, Sam. - No, I... - I have to go. - Please don't leave now. - We have to work. - No. Silly old bitch. You and little Sammy have a nice visit? They put the death sanction on you ten years ago. What happened? Did the Grim Reaper visit the wrong old lady? Just close your eyes. A thousand years will go by just like that. Cheatin' words, lies and deception, as they weave their path work of destiny. Samson's destiny was controlled by betrayal, like a symptom of the night. He... My entire life, controlled! I can't even tell anyone! No one would believe me. It's... It's too fantastic! But they think I don't know I have a mission? Oh, yes I will! I will use my gift. - Hello? - Lisa? - Sam! Thank God. - My name... Lisa... I talked to the doctor. He said he's dealt with spontaneous human combustion, you're not going to die. - My name is not Sam, it's... - Listen to me, because this is very important. The doctor can save your life. There is a vaccine. The fire won't start again! Just stay away from live fire. Don't start the car again. - I may have to get some help. - Okay, okay. Well, wait there. - I'll come get you. - Lisa, listen to me! Dr. Marsh can help. John Mash, doctor? He's a fucknig killer, Lisa! And he's after you! Lisa, listen to me, I have seen files. Lots of files. Lisa! He'll try to give you an injection! An-- Oh, God. God! If you're in on my kill, then fuck you! If you are, then you'd better run for your life! No, Sam, I love you! Nuclear power's given, I'm proof of that. But the old man set me up with Rachle, and then with you! What part of Samson do you serve? I mean, what did you do to me? Did you do something to me that started this fire? - No. - What was in those pills you gave me? Nothing. I don't know. - Where did you get them? - He said he wanted... He said you wouldn't take them for him. He said that I would have to make you! - He was worried about you! - Who? Who! - Lew. - No, no! God, Lisa! No, Lisa! Oh God, pain. Go away, come again some other day. Driver's license... and registration, please. Slowly. - You sure you want it? - Yes. Halt! Burn, goddamn you! - Hello? - Lew! Lew, it's Sam! It's happened! His arm is on fire! It's SHC, and it's spreading! Lisa, relax. Everything's going to be all right. He just called me, Lew, and fire came out of the phone! H-he did it! He made it happen! I'm afraid! - Is he taking his pills? - Yes, yes, I've been giving them to him. Have a hold on you, Lisa. have you been taking your pills, too? No, I... I've been fine. I haven't had any migraines. Lisa, you have to take them at regular intervals, too! Then I want you to calm down and go see Dr. Marsh. Lew, is Dr. Marsh? John Marsh, what does he have to do with same and me? - I don't trust him! - Lisa, Dr. Marsh is a friend. He's trying to help you. Now take the pills. Everything will be fine. I'll get back to you. What is going on? What is happening to me? Lew? Come on in! Good evening, Sam. Boss said I should be expecting a visit from ya. He's waitin' up there for ya. - Waiting so late? - Oh, by the way, happy birthday! Hold on, I got something for ya. Nice old Mr. Fitzpatrick. Isn't it time you retired? Just hold on. Sam... Get out with your hands on your head. Come on, now. Only my right arm works, so I don't know how I'll handle your request, officer. Y-you put your arm up there! I mean it! Why don't you come over here and put it there yourself? Don't fuck up, now. Fitzpatrick... I thought you were my friend. As you can see, I'm not all here. - I'm so sorry, Sam. - Stay back! Lew! Uncle Samson's here! Hello, my boy! Come in, come in. Always glad to see you. I... I kinda hoped you got by. - Where's Rachel? - Oh... Sorry, she's... She's out for the evening. You know, son, you don't look so well. Hasn't Lisa been taking care of you? - How do you know her? - Well, she's a friend of the family. - S-she called here looking for you. - You mean to warn you. God! Lew, you killed my parents! I did not kill your parents. They knew exactly what they were doing. The vaccine they were given was designed to create a shield around their cells to make them impervious to radiation! - And it worked! - For nine months! Yes, nine months! How long do you think the first heart transplant patients lived? - Days! That's all. - But they were sick! My parents were young and healthy! And look at me! Look what you've done to me, you...! You are awfully ungrateful. You're a lucky man. I have watched over you as if you were mine. I've given you everything. Y-you should thank me! Thank you? By all rights, you should never have been born. And if it wasn't for me, you never would have been. When your mother got pregnant, those idiots thought the project were ruined. They dropped the whole thing. But it wasn't a mistake. I gave Brian Bell $25,000 to make that "mistake". I've had high hopes for what would happen, and you didn't let me down. I am so proud of you. Don't you see, Sam? I'm your father. Brian Bell was just the mistake part. I made the sun rise twice that morning in 1955. What did Brain Bell do to compare with that? Now this is all Marsh's fault. He always wanted to... put down the project. That's a lie! It was in the pills that you and that... bitch Lisa gave me! She's like you, Sam. A product of the project. She was conceived during the last above ground test in '65. The vaccine worked. But SHC always followed. Lisa and you, I thought you might honestly like her. I hoped you two would produce a child, learn to control this thing and use it. It... ...would have been a thing of beauty. I'm sorry, Sam. I got tired of waiting for something to happen. 34 years was long enough. I had no idea it would be this extraordinary. The cleanest killing system on earth. Clean killing system? I like that. You're America's atomic man. The world's most sophisticated nuclear weapon. Can't you see how big this is? Let's see... Time to go online. Just Trinidad and me. Nuclear meltdown! I can almost see the core. The Trinidad Beach Nuclear Power Plant finally came online tonight at midnight, but not without problems. 15 seconds into the switchover to nuclear generated electricity, a 5-mile strip along the exclusive cliff community of Trinidad Bluffs, suffered a tremendous surge of electricity that resulted in a back surge, damaging some very valuable equipment in the nuclear facility. The damanged equipment, a regulator, affects the amount of power sent to Southland suburbs, and potential power surges may continue for some time. So unplug your computer and anything else whose program can be scrambled until this warning is lifted. Hi, this is Lisa, I can't take your call right now, but please leave a message after the beep. No meltdowns tonight, Bob. Now, back to a more innocent time, with this golden oldie... Hello, Lisa? Are you there? This is Rachel, Sam's ex-wife. There are important matters that we have to discuss. My number is 969-0475. Lisa, has Dr. Marsh been in touch? He says it's very important that he sees you. Just another loose end your father left for me to tie up. Where's Dr. Marsh? He's in there. - He's dead! - Dead? Oh, no! Oh, God! He tried to kill me! Stop! Stop! Stop, you're making it worse! I know. Did you hear the news about Grandfather and Sam? They burned to death. I'm Rachel. Nice to finally meet you. Stop it! Lisa! Let me help! I can take your fire. Lisa, no! Don't! Don't go! Don't go!
