(steam hissing) (dramatic music) (air raid siren wailing) (steam hissing) (attendant whistling) - Would all passengers, to clear the platform, and make your way to the shelter at the end of the platform as quickly as possible. Come along now, quickly! Move along now, quickly! Come on, come on, keep a move on. Get down to the shelters - What's happening? - at the end of the platform. Get off. Get off the platform! Come on keep moving, straight to the end of the platform, and down to the shelters! Turn that light out! Can you hear me? Turn that bleeding light out! (tense music) (air raid siren wailing) - I want to know everything that happened, Selina. - I've told you. - Everything, you bitch! Grandridge! Tell me! - He's helped you, Ruben! You'd never have your job without him! - Nor my wife either! - I lived with him! He's my Godfather, he's my only father! - So what did he do? - Please... - I swear, I'll kill you, Selena! (grunting) (whimpering) - Ruben, I never, believe me, I never did it with him! He was too old! - So, what did you do? I want to know, what? Did you handle him? - Ruben, please... - Did you suck him? - Yes! (whimpering) What was I supposed to do, I wasn't even 13 the first time! - But you've been back, haven't you? You lying bitch! Since we were married! - To help you, how do you think you got to be deputy? And this morning, you'd have been sacked if I hadn't gone to him! - Shut up! Christ! - He, he won't admit it though (mumbles) didn't he? (distant explosions booming) You said yeah go on Selina, but I didn't, did I? I don't want his disgusting hands on me anymore! - Shut up, shut up! - Oh I love you Ruben! - No you don't! You married me, to get him off your back. And he chose me, so he could have you any time he wanted! Didn't he? That's the truth! He's sick! So, it's my wife, (explosions booming) it's my job, it's my wage, and it's my flat! It all belongs to Chairman bloody Grandridge! (dramatic music) (explosion booming) (clattering) - God help us! (distant explosions rumbling) - Why'd you tell me? - I'm sorry. - Why? - He had filth in his eyes when he looked at me this morning. It was gonna happen again. I wanted it to stop. You can't carry these things, see Ruben? I, not forever. - And how do you expect me to carry it? How do you expect me to live with it every time I see him? You never loved me as much as I loved you. - Ruben... - It's the truth! And I've carried that. But I'm buggered if I'm gonna carry him every time he smirks at you! I might not be a chairman, with a big estate in Haywards Heath and a black sedan, and cows and barns and little bits on the side, but I have my own self respect. And I have that. (tense music) - What are you gonna do? - You're gonna write a letter, to your dear father! - He's not my father! - He may as well be, scum like that would do it to his daughter, wouldn't he? You're gonna send him around a love letter, here! You tell him to take the 8:30 to Brighton, because you've changed your mind about going to Haywards Heath! - No! - And you tell him to make sure no one sees him! You and me girl, we're not carrying nothing. You and me together. All clear, Selina? (tense music) - Flora! Engine's up to (mumbles) Brighton, so I thought I'd say hello to Auntie. Hello Flora. What's up with you? I just walked four miles from Haywards Heath. Cat got it, eh? Flora? - She hasn't spoke since her sister died. - That's over a year ago isn't it? - Tell that to big ape Colin Key, he's still going 'round swearin' death on Grandridge for Louise. - Ah no no not all that, but I believe it. - (mumbles), both she and Colin say the chairman done it to Louise right there in his old house. And that's where she ran from. (dog barking) - And I believe it. - Be there to tell you. If you can. She's been waiting long enough Jack, every day she's looking down that line, she's in love with you and that's a fact. - Don't be bloody silly, I'm not having any of that! - I'd say you can have anything you want as far as Flora's concerned! - Shut up! - She's my bloody daughter! And so was Louise! And I know. - (sighs) Oh, sorry old May, sorry. - It's all right dear. This bloody war gets to all of us. I had a bloody 'Nuff of it all. - Flora's... Why'd she marry him? - Look at me. Look at my hands! I lost two stone! (hinges squeaking) (steam whistle wailing) (chattering) (tense music) - Could you give me my compartment Henry? - Not to my train no more. Busted coupling rod, driver and Percy are held up in Brighton. - Yeah but did you get it? I wanted a compart... - Bloody ape! (tense music) Can't fool me, that's the bleedin' Chairman! - [Conductor] All aboard, all aboard! Brighton Express! - I'd kill (mumbles) then Mrs. Roberts. (whistling) (steam hissing) (suspenseful music) (poignant music) - Say hello to me Flora, I'm nearly a brother to you. I'm sorry about Louise. It must be hard for a woman to take when her sister's being pestered like that. And in here turned all red. You know me Flora, Jacky! I'm a lonely boy Flora. I hear you've been pestering them trackmen, and tormenting them with those muscles of yours, what about Oswald eh? And you take a crowbar to him? Wouldn't do that to me, would you? (sighs) Ah, I knew you wouldn't. (sighing) I'm sorry I didn't come before but I've been ill. I've been working. And I'm scared Flo. Come here please. It's me, it's me! Why'd you think I never come here before, I've been too scared! I think about it every night! There is no one else! (poignant music) (dramatic music) (steam hissing) (train clattering) (train rumbling) (dramatic music) (steam hissing) (train Chuffing) - Criminals! (door slamming) They've been after the bloody coal in the sheds again Ruben. - Oh... - We're gonna have to bring the army in, put a bloody guard on it. - Yeah, that's right. - How's the Chairman? - What? - The Chairman, you saw him yesterday morning at Victoria, didn't you? - Oh yes, yes, oh good John. He says "Ruben, you have any further problems, "bring them to me." - You're a lucky boy. - Yeah. - I'm off to get an eye full. - Right, bye John. (poignant music) - She's still by the window, been there all night, hasn't even changed her clothes! - Cup of tea please Miss. Mail was 17 minutes late I understand. - Ain't you my wife's (mumbles) Victoria, Ruben. - [Ruben] 17 bloody minutes, (mumbles) is it? - Place was all right now was it? - What? Oh yes, yes, yes it was. (train whistle blowing) Depending what you're doing in here, like this. Veronica's a good woman, there's enough separation in this bloody world... - I hope you're not referring to me! Bloody nerve! - All right Phyl! Ruben! Veronica knows all about me and Phyl. She even gives me clean underpants to come down to Brighton with. Otherwise Phyl'd think she don't look after me proper, don't you Phyl? - What's it got to do with him? - Sorry. I don't know why I said it. - Mr. Roberts! M-Mr. Roberts! Mr. Davidson says come quick, there's been a m-murder! (tense music) - Ruben! Ruben where the hell have you been? Don't you know what's happened? They found the Chairman on the line up to Langley Cross! He's been stabbed! - Is this the man? - What man? - I told him you were on the train, Ruben. - Superintendent Fish, Brighton CID. Mr. Roberts, isn't it? - Yes sir. (camera clacking) (onlookers muttering) - Look! He's been as queer as a nine-bob note this morning. - There's going to fetch him. They're fetching her and all. (camera clacking) - [Fish] Quick set her down! - I'm sorry. He seems like a father to me (sobs). - Now you take it very very easily Mrs. Roberts. We can all understand. - Thank you. (train whistle blowing) - That's the Victoria. It's two minutes late Mr. Davidson! - Don't worry about that now Ruben. Now I understand from your husband Mrs. Roberts, that you saw Mr. Grandridge at his home yesterday morning. - Saw the Chairman myself on Victoria. - What happened? - Somebody's tupped the Chairman. - If he suggested you went down with him to visit his sister today, why do you think he decided to travel last night? - We, saw him on the platform at Croydon sir. - [Fish] You saw him at Croydon? (tapping) (brooding music) - Yes, in his compartment, first class. - We had a few words. - We didn't think to ask him why he brought (mumbling). - Yeah and then we got back into our own compartment, Superintendent. - I see. There's no corridor on this train, am I correct? - Yes sir. - See the body was found on the line before the next stop, Haywards Heath, so whoever killed him must have got into his compartment at Croydon. - I see. Did you see anybody do that? - No sir. Definitely not. - So it could be you were the last to see him alive. - T-There was quite a scrimmage, I-I mean there was a blackout, a regiment was moving, so I suppose... - Anyone could have got in with him, that's the truth of it. That must have been what happened. - [Fish] So did you see anyone? - What, I might, uh... - (sobs) He was so kind to us! - Excuse me sir! - Sergeant would you please clear this platform! - Yes sir! - I saw it! I saw the killing! - [Fish] Sir? - I was in the tunnel at Langley. - What did you see sir? - The train, one of the blackouts was up. I saw a man with a knife. - Would you recognize him? - I don't think so, it was going about 60. - May I have a word sir? - What? - I've just come back from Langley Cross sir. I spoke to the signal man, they've found a body sir. A Mr. Maurice Mussell, not a very nice proposition if you ask me sir. - And he said what, Sergeant? - There's a foreign laborer called Colin Caine who's been issuing threats against Grandridge for the past year, something to do with a girl. Caine's got a record sir. - Well you'd better talk to him. And get the names of everyone here, this isn't a proper place to be conducting a murder investigation, is it? I want to talk to them later, and him! He thinks he saw it happen. (tense music) - She's up there again, sitting lonely as a shroud. - They're not gonna bite the hand, are they? Whoever done it dear must have had cause. That's what I've read, murders always have cause as a reason. And what cause did she have? - Because she's a cunt, and that kind are the beginning and end of everything, always have been and always will be. - They got him. Made an arrest. - Bugger me! - Who says we don't have the best police in the world! (hinges creaking) (metallic clattering) - Bloodstained clothing under his bed sir. - Good, have it examined. - And Grandridge sir, got bit of a reputation, with the girls, sometimes very young girls so I've heard. - Chairman of Southern Railways. Makes me feel sick. - [Colin] I hated him, I admit that. - Because of Flora's sister, Colin? - Oh no I'm not saying what he done to her. - We heard all about it. Did you love Louise, Colin? The official cause of her death was a broken neck. - She was running away from that old... He was saying things to her, he was making her life a misery! Well he may as well have pushed her down that ridge himself, it was him just about who killed her! - So you see a fat chance on the station and think you can get your own back. - I wasn't in Croydon I told 'ya, I was in bed! - But you can't prove it, can you? And let's face it Mr. Caine you've been here before, haven't you? Three years for assault and battery! - It wasn't my fault! They was picking on me, there was three of 'em! What, let me out, please! I loved her, that's all! - I understand Colin, believe me. Perhaps you had no intention of killing him. - No, I... - But you did, didn't you? Then you nicked his watch to make it look like a robbery! - I didn't! - It was like this one Colin. Except his was gold, wasn't it? - Was it? - And you had his money! - I didn't! - Now wait a minute Colin, you see, we know Mr. Grandridge had 100 pounds on him, his sister told us she was expecting him to bring it down to her. - Did she? - But it wasn't in his pockets when we found him. How do you explain that? - Perhaps he dropped it? - Or you took it. - No! - And got off the train with it at Haywards Heath! - No! - You live near there don't you? - Yeah, I do. - So, you had his watch, and his money, and you - No! killed him for your girl! - No no (sobs)! Let me go, please! I loved her! - We'll find the truth, won't we son? (distant typewriter clacking) (door slamming) - I don't know why you told them about seeing him at Croydon! That was bloody stupid, Ruben! - You couldn't even wash your hands. - Keep my mouth shut, that's what you said! What about that driver? - Jack! Jack Dando isn't it? We heard the Sergeant take your name. Ruben Roberts, Deputy Stationmaster. - My wife Selina. - Mrs. Roberts. - You're on the Victoria run aren't you? This is a do isn't it? Got you in for a statement too? - No I didn't see much. - Nor me. Nor us. You'll have to come and share a bottle, won't he Selina? Have a game of cards. - [Selina] That'd be nice. - [Ruben] Would you like to Jack? - Mr. Dando this way please! - What's he thinking? - About me I should think. - What? - Are you blind Ruben, he fancies me (mumbles). - [Fish] You say you saw another shape pass the window as Mr. Grandridge was stabbed. - I don't know who it was. - Who? Are you saying you think there could have been two assailants, Mr. Dando? - I don't know Superintendent, it was going so fast. - You see we discovered a traveling (mumbles) on the line near the body, we had the idea that it perhaps had been thrown up in the struggle, and that's what you saw past the window. - It might have been. - And not a second assailant? - No. - Good. Now can you give us any kind of description? (tense music) - Can't... - Mr. and Mrs. Roberts. Perhaps you can help us jog Mr. Dando's memory. The man you think you saw on Croydon Station. - We didn't say exactly there was such a man sir. - Ah. Let me explain. If we had a description of the man on the train from Mr. Dando and one of the man on the station from you, it would mean that any suspicion we may or may not have of others would be irrelevant, wouldn't it? - I understand Superintendent. - I think... - I'm very sorry we're so vague. - There might have been. - Well what did he look like, was he short, tall, or about your height Mr. Roberts? (tense music) - On the, well I can't be certain, but I'd say taller. - Yes I would. - Well just a minute, perhaps Mr. Dando can help. Would you stand up, Mr. Roberts? (suspenseful music) Was your man shorter or taller, Mr. Dando? - About the same height I should say. - Oh no. - No I seem to remember someone much taller. - Can't be sure. - The man I saw sir, was definitely taller. Quite a rough looking man. - And he had a beard. - A beard? Are you sure? - Yes, I think... - I'm sure! - [Fish] Mr. Dando? - I don't know. - [Fish] Well never mind Mr. Dando I think perhaps we can help. Sergeant? - [Sergeant] This way sir. - Oh no not you for the moment, Mrs. Roberts. I hear you're to be congratulated. Mr. Grandridge has left you his old house at Maidly Cross hasn't he? Nice little place I hear. Did you know you were in his will? - Yes. He-He was the most generous man I've ever known, Superintendent, and I, I don't know how we're gonna manage without him. He was the most (weeps), I hope, I just hope you catch the evil, (mumbles)... - Don't you worry my dear, we'll catch him. You can be sure of that. - Sorry I don't know. - Never mind sir. - This way Mr. Roberts. Take your time. (tense music) - I can't be certain. - [Selina] These? - [Fish] Relax Mrs. Roberts. (tense music) - (whimpers) I didn't do it! I didn't do it! (Colin whimpering) - I think it was him, Superintendent. - And what's the defending counsel gonna make of that, Sir? - He'd laugh at us Sergeant. - Especially when he hears about the blood on Caine's trousers. - Yes? - Rabbit. - Ah. Mrs. Roberts, a very beautiful woman, isn't she? - Sir? - Arthur Grandridge and his young girls. She lived with him didn't she? Go back to Haywards Heath, talk to his sister. Check his land office as well. We'll look into the pit Sergeant, shall we? - Huh? - Is it lust or is it money, or a house in a will. Ruben, Ruben Roberts and his wife, or perhaps it's lost love. Colin Caine! - What should we do with him sir? (door slamming) - Railway murder! (trains rumbling) Read all about! Railway murder! Read about it! (brakes whining) Railway murder, read all about it! Railway murder! Who done it? Railway murder! Railway murderer! - Jack! Isn't this a bit of a puzzle isn't it? - Yes, suppose it is. - Ruben and me were just saying, we should get to know you better. - Yeah. - Perhaps you'll, come up for a cup of tea. - [Ruben] Yeah, it's just up there. - No, sorry I'm off. - What up to Victoria? (steam engine Chuffing) (mumbles) you're going tonight and not tomorrow morning? - Yeah that's right. - Blimey it's you Selina! - What? - Going off on your shopping! Spends all my bloody hard earned! Underwear... - Ruben! - (chuckles) Women eh Jack? Do me a favor will you mate? You know what it's like to (mumbles), black market, (mumbles), air raids you know. - Oh Ruben it's... - Jack won't mind Selina! - Look after her for me up there will you mate? I'd appreciate it. - [Selina] So would I. - [Newspaper Vendor] Railway murderer, read about it! - No I don't want to see it, why do you have to keep hiding it? Christ sake, why don't you do something with it? - Want to chuck it in the sea? That and all, chuck it? Well what do you want to do with it, 'cause you're not bloody spending it even if it is on your bloody engine driver! - You told him to take me up to town Ruben! - And talk with him! I didn't say ask him for dinner, did I? If you think, you're spending any of this, I am what I am but I'm not a bloody thief! We got his house, I'm not gonna spend his money as well. - He's got his name in the wa... - I don't care about his name, I want to know what to do with it! Here, you get rid of it! - I didn't say I wanted it. - Right! So it stays here. Under here. Underneath this, (boards squeaking) where it belongs. In memory of the chairman. I don't regret anything Selina. - What's gonna happen? - Nothing's gonna happen. - They released that man. - [Ruben] Good, I don't want nobody getting hanged for us. - If it was a choice between him and me... - You'd let them do it? - I would. - No one's gonna get tupped. You keep an eye on that loco driver, everyone will forget all about it, and we'll be in the clear. Won't we? (steam hissing) (public address chattering) - You'll rub her away you berk! - She's my little lady, you should know by now! My one and only aren't you dear? At least I know where I am with you. Shiny girl first in perfect mint. - What are you so happy about? - Hi Jack. Eckleston Square, one o'clock, remember? (chuckling) - Shut up! Are you pissed again? I'm tired of working with a belly full of beer! These slide-valves need adjusting! - I already done it Jack (chuckles)! I thought your girl was Beatrice? (steam hissing) (pensive music) - [Flagman] London Victoria! (whistling) (steam whistle hooting) (train clattering) (engine Chuffing) (diners chattering) - [Waitress] One ragout, one rice. Quick as you can please, we need the table. - You don't talk much Jack. Are you married by chance? You must have a lady friend? A man like you, I bet all the girls... - I haven't. I haven't got a girlfriend. - Well you're not one of those are you? I know what you are. You're a little boy aren't you? (tense music) Do you like that? - Yeah. - Tell me. What you think of me? (sighs) You think I'm guilty don't you? - Yeah. - You're wrong. I'm not. - [Waitress] Three and 10, pay the cashier. (diners chattering) - I'm not guilty. (tender music) Please don't (mumbles) people, by thinking I am! - I'll believe anything you want me to believe. (sighs) You can do anything you want with me. - Promise? (sighs) That's all settled then. - That's it? - Oh we're friends. And, Ruben hasn't got anything to worry about, has he? - I love you! - Jacky, whatever so silly! - So odd, to be worried if I was ill. - Oh, is that time, I've got to run! Um, um, see you in a half past six. (diners chattering) (tender music) That's where the Chairman brought us. (distant dog barking) All the bills, including rent. - I don't want to hear. We're selling it and good riddance. We'll make a few hundred out of it anyway. - You'll take that money will you? - That's the price he pays. (distant dog barking) - You know Jack thinks we did it, don't you? - What did he say? - He said he loved me! - What did he say about... - Did you hear me? He said... - Is he going to the police? - Why how should I know? - Well keep you eye on him until you bloody do! I don't trust that copper! He's looking at us. There's something he... All that about suspicions, he may or may not have. He was saying something wasn't he? - Saying what? - I don't know. Why don't you go and find out? Tell him about Grandridge, what he done to all those girls in here. There must be 100 men out there wanting to tupp him. - I don't want to go back to the police station Ruben! - You want to live like this? Go back, tell the copper... - Everything to your satisfaction? Get rid of the place. - Would you like me to show around in Heath, for possible purchasers? - Yes please Mr. Mussel. - I uh... - Don't worry, you'll get something out of it. - Oh that's very kind of you. I'll go and put the kettle on back at my house. Shall I? (tense music) (eerie voices chattering) (eerie chimes jingling) (door closing) - Come here my little pumpkin! - Hello. You the girl who doesn't speak? Sometimes I wish I didn't think. - Don't we all, Mrs. Roberts? I think we'd all like to forget the past, wouldn't we? - I'm sorry Superintendent, I, I wanted you to know. (telephone ringing) Mr. Grandridge wasn't all... - All he seemed to be? We knew. But thank you for writing it down for us. And thank you for your kindness in coming in to see me. - I wanted to Superintendent, you see there's been such a lot of gossip, can I ask you... - As a matter of fact you saved me a journey. - Did I? - Yes, milk? - Thank you. You don't think that my husband and me... - Sugar? - Thank you, one. That we had anything to do with this do you? - Why should I think that? - The Chairman hurt me so much when I was a child Superintendent, I-I must admit, there were times I wanted to kill him. - Is that why you wrote him this? (tense music) I'm sorry Mrs. Roberts. I didn't give you a teaspoon. Is that your handwriting? Did you write that note? - Yes. - Did you send it to Mr. Grandridge? - Yes. - Did you kill Mr. Grandridge, Mrs. Roberts? - (sighs) No! I swear Superintendent, I swear! - I think you better explain, don't you? - I want to tell you everything! That morning, we met Mr. Grandridge, he wanted me to go down with him to his estate the next day. And Ruben wanted me to, he thought the closer I was to Mr. Grandridge the better it was for him. I want to, tell you the truth Superintendent, but I could never tell it to Ruben! He didn't know. He didn't know, that, it was still... - Still going on between you and Mr. Grandridge? (forlorn music) - Yes. - So you said you'd go to Haywards Heath? - (sniffles) Yes. - But you didn't did you? - I changed my mind after I wrote the note. I couldn't bear the thought of what he'd do to me, so I told Ruben flat, I was sick and I wasn't going. And that's why we went to his compartment, to Croydon, to tell him I wasn't going. He was very angry and he slammed the door on us and that was the last we saw of him. - (weeps) You can't imagine what I've been through these last few years Superintendent. (sniffles) Please, promise me, you'll never tell Ruben. - I understand Mrs. Roberts. Forgive me for upsetting you. Please accept my apologies and my best wishes for both yourself, and your husband. (typewriter clacking) (telephone ringing) - (sighs) Thank you. - What did you think of that? - As you say sir, she's a very beautiful woman. - Then you won't mind keeping an eye on her, will you Sergeant? (air raid siren wailing) - Clear the station, clear the station! (whistling) Clear the station! Get off the platform! Get off, clear the station! (engine Chuffing) Are you deaf? - Don't tell me what to do warden. - Never know who you're gonna meet down there, do 'ya? Come along dear! No one wants any turnips delivered now! Percy wait! - Coming Mrs. Roberts? - [Man] Come on! - [Man] Meet at the shelter! Only blood and bones up here! - Part of the war effort. Do you like it? - What are you doing here? - Just having a cup of tea. - You should go to the shelter. - You take me? - [Warden] Clear the station! Come on, everybody clear the station! - Run, run, run, run! (footsteps pounding) - [Ruben] You can bomb me out of this bloody world if you want. - They won't get us though Rube will they? Ignore the bastards, that's what I say. Fancy a game of cards? - Yes John, I bloody would. (crowd murmuring) - I need to see you. - You are. - Not here! You were waiting for me just now, why are you doing that? Came to get me, didn't 'ya? I know what's going on! So do you. Selina, Ruben don't care. - Oh, wish it was all better. - You know what I want. I know you do, tell me. (explosion rumbling) - Anyhow, this is Catherine. Alex, Tom, Carver, Brody, here you are. This is Ruben. Five card stud, tenner minimum. - Tenner? - You can afford it. None of us was left a house by the Chairman. Why don't you deal, and we can get off 'ya. - Yeah, why not? (steam hissing) (engines Chuffing) - Cup of tea please Phyl. - I hear you got a big lie now Mrs. Roberts. Can I lie down in the back please with them other carrots? - Leave her alone Henry, bloody mind your own! Here's your tea love? - What did he say? What... - He wanted to ride in my (mumbles) Ruben, that's all, he was joking! - I'm not having my bloody wife... - Your bloody wife? You talking about? You don't care if I go up to London, or if I go down to Shelby. - I'm not talking about him! I don't want you seeing that grinning prick Henry as well! What are you anyway? You know the kind of women they make those kind of remarks to, don't you? - What kind of women? - You know! - What kind? - Whores, they're the ones who ask for it! - Well we don't get much of it do we. - What do you mean by that? - I'm talking about a sex life Ruben. - Shut up! You're disgusting! You never liked it, well, not with me Selina! So don't start pretending now! You do what you do, but don't do it in the buffet, in front of the railway men! (Ruben sighing) Do what you want. (door slamming) (brooding music) - No Jack, not yet... Not, just wait, just a little while. Do you remember, before the war, it was different. Everyone going to the beach, and all the things we did then? - Selina... - I want that again. - I love you. (moaning) (lips smacking) - Wait! Jack? - (sighs) You're too beautiful in the light. - Come here. - Oh my sweet! It's all right. (dramatic music) (gun firing) God! Those thieves are after the coal! - [Man] Over there! (gun firing) - It was him! - I don't care. You make me crazy, and you make me better. (serene music) (steam hissing) (tense music) - You nearly got him there Rube! You know you put the lead up the thieve's ass! The only trouble is, the army can't shoot straight! I'm going five bob, wanna see me? - Uh yeah, but I haven't got it John. - Can I lend you (mumbles), Mr. Roberts. - We been, berked! When you want it, they don't, get rid 'em! - Berks... - Look at that, company (mumbles), stuck, hard at attention, ready and willing to serve! Women are the masters of the world! Pursing up their twinky little bollocksy noses! - Percy I don't feel, me heads killing me! (eerie music) There's a lot you don't know about me Percy. There's a lot she don't know about you. (gasping) (eerie chimes jingling) (eerie voices chattering) - Yeah. Come here! (gasping) (clattering) - Go back to sleep. - What are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing? Do I ask you what you've been doing? You have what you have, I have what I have. - I need some shoes Ruben! - You need money? Get the house sold. And we both know where we stand Selina! So does the hangman. (door slamming) (steam hissing) (passengers chattering) Phone lines are down sir. - We run. - There's no way of telling if the road is clear. - We run Ruben. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't get these boys back home. Uptown again Mrs. Roberts? - It's my treat Mr. Davidson! I hope we get there! - Don't worry about that! - [Selina] Bye Ruben! (train whistle hooting) - You're looking tired Ruben. Let me know if I can, help. - Thank you sir. (train whistle hooting) (engine Chuffing) (resolute music) (steam hissing) - Hello Mr. Roberts. Have to get a new one, won't we? Wouldn't want the hangman to think we've given up! - Ha, blimey! Ha! - Ta ta, Mr. Roberts. - Thank you Mrs. Liddle, you've been most helpful. Good morning Mr. Roberts! A heck of a day, isn't it? Give my regards to your wife. (brooding music) (wheels whining) - [Percy] Ain't this a bitch! (steam hissing) It's not her fault! I told you to turn on your bags! You drift into it! - If you hadn't been pie-eyed all night chasing tart, we'd have had the coal when we were at the station! - You need any help? Looks like a dig, this! - She's dragging the snow with her, I'm gonna have to take off the ash can. - Taking orders, boy! - What else do you expect me to do? - And what are you going to do about them? - What in the hell's going on? Get them back on! - Some of them can wait in the house! By god (mumbles) wanna be warmer! A cold carriage or Vera's kitchen! Too kind Mrs. Roberts! Flora, get some bloody plates out of the shed. Put up some more boxes girl! Find somewhere to sit! - You touched my shoulder! It wasn't me! - Colin what are you talking about? Get those bloody logs on the fire! (chattering) You'll be better in here, away from the third class, Mrs. Roberts. Have a sit. Like to look over your property while you're here Mrs. Roberts? I have made a repair or two. - Not now thank you Mr. Mussell. - I'll get the girl to get you a hot cup of tea! Vera! It's Mrs. Roberts! (door clattering) (wind howling) - Thanks Colin! You're a good man. - Uh, thank you mister! - Yeah, we'll be out of here in a bit. Why don't you have yourself a warm-up? - Don't you think we should get a doctor? - She's blind, no doctor can do anything about that. We're never gonna be able to get in and out of London tonight so we're gonna have to stay there. - And I know just the place! - Damn (mumbles). Get out! Silly bitch. Can't talk, spends her whole day lying about trees. - I saw here shoveling the snow! She was like a man! - Yeah. Kiss me Selina. - Lines are open again Ruben. Mrs. Roberts teletyped from the office at Victoria. She won't be able to get back down tonight. You care to have tea with myself and my good lady? Pass the time? - No thanks Mr. Davidson, I've got a prior engagement. - Don't try and carry things all on your own, will 'ya? - Nah. Thanks all the same. (sorrowful music) (coals crackling) - Bitch. Bitch! Bitch! (sobbing) Bitch! - I want every night to be like this. Every, every night! You don't realize! - Realize what? What? - He's sitting there in Brighton waiting for me to come back, I wish he didn't exist! You don't realize, you don't your really don't! - I guess I do. - Do 'ya? - I realize that you and Ruben killed the Chairman. Is that what you were gonna say? - Oh god. - So tell me. Did he look at you, when you killed him? What did it feel like? - Do you really want to know? - I want to know everything, everything. Tell me, tell me! - I've never felt so full or better in my life! (sighing) Jack! (dramatic music) (lips smacking) (grunting) (heavy breathing) - [John] You had enough Ruben? - No. - [John] Sure? - Deal! (eerie tense music) - Darling? Jack, what is it! - Every time I see you I just want to... (sobs) I just want... - I know, I know... Oh you're crying! Oh Jack! Oh I love you so much! I was dreaming it was just you and me. You still love me don't you know you know? - I love you even more! - Do you? And I love you! I love you I love you, I love you I love you! I love you! - It's all there sir, the Roberts statement that they saw the deceased on Croydon Station, statements from various, describing his sexual habits, his will, leaving his old house to Mrs. Roberts, her letter asking him to get the 8:30 to Brighton, and the statement you took from the old girl, Mrs. Liddle, saying that Mrs. Roberts sat fully clothed by her window from 10 that night until we saw her on the platform the following morning. Add that to the fact that Mrs. Roberts is having it her way with the only material witness to the murder, Mr. Dando, and I'd say we've got 'em, sir. When shall I bring 'em in? - I've just come from the Chief Constable, Sergeant. He told me that in a war the moral of the people is paramount. He told me Sergeant that Arthur Grandridge was a well known, respected public figure who's looked up to by the people. In the light of that, the fact that he spent a lifetime molesting young women, not to say young girls, not to say children! Is neither here nor there. - Sir? - The Chief Constable told me Sergeant, the honor of Chairman Grandridge is not to be called into question in a court of law. (sighing) He has been instructed to instruct us, that this investigation, is put on the shelf. - What? - I'm sorry. - But they're bloody guilty! - In war apparently moral is more important than justice! - Then what are we fighting for? - Sergeant, if in the course of your other duties, you were able to keep an eye on Mr. Robert's I'd... - Sir? - He's a nervous man. He may come to us. - A bit of pressure sir? - That's all Sergeant. And don't think that you're gonna get away with anything, madam! (pencil snapping) - He's at the (mumbles)! 100 pounds and he hasn't even put the fucking floorboard back! - Is that his watch? It's stopped, heh, like him. It's gold. - You can have it if you want. And that! - This? - That's the knife Ruben used to kill him! You have it. - Just like the Black Museum. - Yes a bloody museum all right, it's dead and rotten, the lot of it! Put the floorboard back. (sighing) Wish we could go away! Just you and me Jack! - We can. Why don't we? - I have a house at Langley! If I took off Ruben would have the lot! - Let him! - It's half mine, the Chairman left it to me! - Then stay! Keep the house, live with Ruben. - I don't want to live with Ruben! - So what do you want to do about it? - What do you want to do about it? - What are you asking me? (tense music) - You know. At night he patrols the sheds. - With the army. - Not always. And there have been coal thieves, we've seen 'em. And some say, they carry knives. I watched you. When I told you about Grandridge, I know what you want. Then it'd be you and me, you and me in the house at Langley. (suspenseful music) - I'm on again tonight. Past a (mumbles). But, you know all about that. (sorrowful music) Bloody war, eh? - He said it. (laughing) - Is that sandwich fresh? How should I know, I've only been here a fortnight! (laughing) - That's an old one Emerie. - So's the bloody sandwich! (laughing) (booing) (laughing) (airplane engines droning) (steam hissing) - He won't come! - He might! - I've got it, I've got it! - Will you use it? - He won't come! He'll piss off, and he'll play cards like he always does! - He has to work sometimes, Jack! Now, what if he does, tonight? - Then I'll kill him, won't I? - Will you? You promise me! (lips smacking) (sighs) Jack! - Leave me alone! (clattering) - It's him! Come on, where's the knife? (Selina panting) (suspenseful rumbling) Kill him! Go after him! - I can't! - [Selina] Oh! (thumping) Oh! - [Jack] I'll do it, I promise 'ya! - Well we can go up to London anyway. I know you can do that! - I'll do it! I want to! (steam hissing) (explosion booming) (bottles rattling) - That was that unexploded bomb in Leighton Square. - It's exploded now dear. - God help us. - If he's up there, perhaps he isn't. Perhaps it's just us, beasts in hell. (sorrowful music) - Well that's the end of her then. (steam hissing) - [Jack] You're going to hell, for making a fool of me in the snow like that, stopping me in that tunnel, what's up with 'ya? - Jack! This is Percy's! - Give it! - Are you all right Jacky? You look a bit pale to me. - I hope we aren't going to be late, driver. - You've always got a shoulder to cry on. (mumbling) - All aboard six o'clock Victoria train! London Victoria! (passengers chattering) (whistling) (steam hissing) (engine Chuffing) - Ruben! Big game tonight. - Right John. - Do you know how much that bloody wax cost? What are you doing girl? You've been sitting there five hours! And you, if you don't get off your ass, the six o'clock's coming through, lover boy's train! I've seen you up on that bank, watching that (mumbles) every night! Stupid mutt, he doesn't want you! He's got better things now hasn't he? (car horn beeping) There you are, go on, out there! (distant dog barking) (distant train whistle blowing) (train rumbling) - Oh no! (tense music) (controls clicking) (train rumbling) (suspenseful music) (Flora grunting) (rhythmic clattering) (steam whistle hooting) (suspenseful music) (train rumbling) - Flora! (train rumbling) (brakes whining) (steam hissing) Flora! (thunderous crashing) (tense music) - All over. - Ruben. She's all right dear. - Oh I know that Phyllis. Mr. Davidson gave me the full facts within hours after the event. My wife was at the back of the train, and the driver and his fireman were injured, but they're all right too I understand. - Yeah we all know that Ruben. - It's that poor mad dumb girl that worries me. She's dead. - Like a nice cup of tea? - She's had 36 hours down there now Phyl. I'll give here another couple of days to look after him, then I'll go down and bring her back home. Good morning. - Oh dear. - I saw her face. - I don't care about her. - She was sitting in the lorry when we came out. - What's she got to do with anything? (thumping) - Is he still here? - That's Colin. - Is Henry still here? - He's the same as you Jack, doctor said he should rest. - You're up there a lot. - Colin makes the soup. Henry makes me laugh. - What do I do? - Thank you dear. Look what Colin's brought you Jack. That's very kind of you Colin, you're a lovely, lovely man. You can keep it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - [Colin] Thank you. - He pinches everything I leave about. He took Grandridge's watch. - What? - He took it out of your pocket. You didn't want them to find that on you, did you? He didn't pinch this though. I kept it for you. Just for you. I know what you are. - You know what Henry is. - What are you saying? - He's good for a laugh, what else he good for? - I haven't done it with him is that what you're asking me, if you want to know the truth I've thought about it! Anyway Henry's (mumbles). Sex is easy Jacky, anyone can do it. This isn't easy though, is it? (knife clicking) (tense music) I want you to go this afternoon as well. I want you to book into a hotel in Haywards Heath and be seen around. And I want you to go to the post office for me. (steam hissing) (engine Chuffing) - Hello Ruben! A little bird tells me you've been playing poker in a (mumbles). That's an unlicensed premises, I could collar you for that! - What? - I'm not polite like my governor Ruben! How much you lose, anyway? 100 nicker I was told. Where'd you get that? - Saved it, it's out of my wage. - 100 notes? That's what the old Chairman lost isn't it, when you blocked his light? Come on Ruben you can tell me. Where's your old lady? Still mucking off the engine driver is she? What do you think about that? - You don't know anything. - It's what I've heard. As a matter of fact it's what I've seen! He does it in the engine sheds over there, in one of the workshops. Bit of sacking on the floor... - There's room for her. - What are you talking about? - I know! I know where she is! She's down there isn't she, she's in her red room, I've seen it! Do you think I'm off my rocker, it's bloody simple! You see Selina, to my mind, had this room when she was a child, (poignant music) and there's always room for a childhood in a person isn't there? And there's always room for Selina in me. I understand that now. - Come on Ruben, you can tell me all about it. - Ruben! It came from your wife. (maudlin music) - See, what I tell 'ya? She wants me to go down, that's what she wants. (sobs) She wants me to bloody go down... - [Davidson] Don't worry old son. (Ruben sobbing) You're among friends. (door clattering) - Have you done it? - Where's Colin? He hasn't been sniffing around you again has he? - I sent him away, have you booked into a hotel? - Yeah, the old girl who runs the place thinks I'm asleep, she even brought me a cup of tea. Seeing Henry later for a drink. - A drink? - Normal behavior, isn't it? - Ruben will be here at eight! - And I will be in Haywards Heath by nine, in the back of the hotel, give the old girl an empty cup back, down the pub for Henry, what's wrong with that? - We have to put the body on the line! - The B and A was Heath by half past! - Are you losing your nerve? - (sighs) my head aches! Why are you undressed? - I want to give Ruben a welcome. - What? - You'll be here. We should both take our clothes off. - What for? - Blood! You have to meet Henry haven't you? There'll be blood everywhere! I learned that much from... - Grandridge. - Yeah. I'll, just have my dressing gown on. He'll come in, you'll be behind the door, with... - No clothes on. - Yeah. I'll take my dressing gown off. He'll come towards me. You'll have the knife... - I'm not an animal! - [Selina] You'll have blood on your clothes! - Well that's it, I'm not an animal! You leave this in front of my eyes (chuckles)! Taking my clothes off, blood on my skin! - You can change your mind if you want to. You can go. Ruben will come, I'll take my dressing gown off, and, and you won't be behind the door. - What will you do? - I'll be with Ruben, Jack! (distant train whistle howling) That's his train, he'll be here soon! (tense music) - Sometimes I don't know if I can see myself properly. - Jack! - I'm not taking my clothes off. - I'm not forcing you, am I? - When he comes, you open the door and I'll be waiting. - I love you! Only you. You know. That's it, hold me. - I love... - I want you to see me! I want you to see what is yours. Look! (suspenseful music) Kiss me. (train rumbling) (knife thumping) (Selina grunting) Jack! But Jack why? (grunting) (gasping) (poignant music) - I don't know. (knife clacking) (eerie haunting music) - [Colin] Mrs. Roberts, Mrs. Rob... Oh my God! Oh, oh, oh... (Colin whimpering) (eerie haunting music) - What have you done? (hinges creaking) (Colin bellowing) - What's the Chief Constable got to say about this then sir? - Well apparently one murder is a matter of public moral, two becomes a matter of public interest, he wants us to clear it up! (hits thudding) (grunting) - Where did you get this? - (sobs) She gave it to me! - Mrs. Roberts? - Uh-huh. - Let me get this clear Colin, this watch was given to you by Mrs. Roberts? - No. I pinched it, I'm sorry! (groaning) - From Mrs. Roberts! (sobbing) (steam hissing) (clanking) - [Phyllis] This your new girl then? - Uh, finally got with a new girl, (mumbles). I've been waiting on you to show up. - That's a clever boy then. You see the police about? - Police, who cares. - They made an arrest. - Old news. - No Jacky new news! They've arrested Ruben as well. - Ruben? - Selina's gone to (mumbles) she? - She has? (tense music) - No Jack, not here! - Oh, my new girl won't tell! - Jacky no! - Come on you bitch, give it to me! - Jacky please! - Give it to me! - Jacky please! No Jacky! (groaning) - Come here (mumbles)! - Left, right, left, right, left, right, yeah! (vendor shouting) Left, right, left, right, left, right, yeah! Company, halt! Left, turn! (officer shouting) (tense music) (steam hissing) (train rumbling) - It's my belief Mr. Roberts, that you and your wife murdered Arthur Grandridge, or that you conspired with her to have him murdered by a third person. - What? - And that you then conspired with this third person in order to murder your wife! - Murder Selina? Me? You must be bloody daft! - Money, Ruben. You had the cash and the house of the old boy, but you lost the money on the tables, so then you needed the house of your wife. - I never wanted that part of her, I wanted her out of all that! I went down to get her didn't I? By the time I got there he'd done it! - Who done it? - The laborer! He had blood all over him! The bloody laborer! - Caine? (engine Chuffing) (train rumbling) - Think I hired him? You must be more insane than I thought. - Selina... - Mrs. Roberts to you! - She picked out Caine at the parade, now why'd she do that? - I don't know! She, she's hardly likely to pick him out if she paid him is she? Anyway that's probably why he killed her! He's a simple sod isn't he? - Simple enough to be used, Ruben! Used by you! - This is mad! It's bloody madness! (engine Chuffing) (fire roaring) - You told Caine to get on at Croydon! - You're an idiot. - You told him to kill Grandridge, rob him, and get out at Haywards Heath. - I'm not talking to you. - And then you thought you'd try and set him up at the identity parade. - No. - You kept the money, and gave him the watch. - What watch? - This watch Mr. Roberts! Where did he get it from? He says he stole it from your wife! - I've never seen it before! - You must have seen it before! - You bloody gave it to him for killing Grandridge! How much did you pay this simple sod for killing your old lady? Tuppence? Money money money Mr. Roberts, that's all you care about isn't it? - I told you, I loved her! He killed her! - Why? (engine Chuffing) (train rumbling) (shovel clanking) - He wouldn't have been jealous of her would he? (engine Chuffing) (train rumbling) And you weren't were you? - Come on Rube, she was having her way with the loco driver, you did bugger all about that did 'ya? (engine Chuffing) (train rumbling) - Grandridge and your wife were both killed by the same weapon, Mr. Roberts! - This! (engine Chuffing) - They were both stabbed in the same way! - Both in the neck! - By the same hand! - For the same reason! Money! (chain clattering) (thumping) (engine Chuffing) - My wife is dead! My blood wife is dead! (engine Chuffing) (train rumbling) Don't you have no pity! I did it! I killed Grandridge, it wasn't her! (engine Chuffing) (train rumbling) I l-loved her! (train rumbling) (tense music) (suspenseful music) - Rupert Daniel Roberts, you are charged that on the 14th day of November, 1940, you did murder Arthur Seymour Grandridge. (fire roaring) Colin Leonard Caine, you are charged that on the 15th day of January, 1941, you did murder Selina Jane Roberts. (engine Chuffing) (train rumbling) (suspenseful music) (door slamming) (steam hissing)
