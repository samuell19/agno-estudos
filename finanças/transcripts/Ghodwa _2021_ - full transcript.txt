- Hello, Ahmed. - Hi, Dad. You locked the door from the inside? You finished early today. The exam wasn't difficult. - Shall I prepare something to eat? - Yes. Okay. The exams went fine. All good. I'm with Dad now, at home. Okay, don't worry, my dear. Okay, sure. Good night. Good night. Ahmed, close the balcony and come in. What did you do today, Dad? As usual, I read. What did you read? The Trial. Again? How many times have you read it? Twice. And how was your day? Good? Yes, good. When do you start your exams? We're nearly finished. I had French and science today. Tomorrow is my last exam day. Ah, yes, of course. You don't like the pasta? It's terrible. Really? You're joking! I'm going to study a bit. You okay, Ahmed? I was looking for a pen. An unprecedented increase in prices and a weak economy led to a huge decrease in the spending power of the Tunisian consumer. In a statement released on Sunday by the National Institute of Statistics, the inflation rate rose to 6.2% in March, against 5.8% in February… Prices are a little high for… Enough news, Dad. It makes you think the world is going to end tomorrow. What happens tomorrow is in our hands. We just need to never give up. It is one of the main reasons that has lead to prices rising, as well as the instability in the past few years. Specialists say that there are possible solutions to the current crisis. Notably… Want some tea? …by government authorities on distributors and price control. …to find a solution for the prices rising… Everyone is equal before the law. Your Honour! Reconciliation can only happen if justice is served. Justice has not been served… Reconciliation does not negate the need for justice. Truth, justice… then we can have reconciliation!

Truth, justice… then we can have reconciliation! Then we can have reconciliation! - Here's your chocolate. - Thanks. Dad, your pills. - What? - Don't forget to take your pills. You're not going out today, Dad? No. Please, Dad, you're not going to get it done in one day. I know. Now, don't be late for school. Your appointment is for tomorrow. It's getting late. You have to go. Focus on your exams. Mohamed! Mohamed! Yes, Ahmed? - Morning. - Good morning. If Dad goes out, don't forget to text me, please. - Sure, don't worry. - Thanks. Where is it? Where is it? Who took it? - Morning! - You're very late! Sorry. Find two examples of rhetorical questions… in here. Come in. - Sorry I'm late. - Take one each.

Good luck, everyone. …on Monday, the deputy head of the Labour Union will lead the negotiation with the government, in support of the workers at the Gafsa Phosphate Mines. In the south of Tunisia… About the problems raised by Gafsa's phosphate mining… Good morning, Mr. Habib! Long time no see, I missed you! - How are you? - Good morning, Saadia. Thank you for asking! I'm doing great. Sorry. How are you? I'm okay. Better now that I've seen you. Tell me, what's your secret? What? The older you get, the better looking you become. Ahmed is staying with me at the moment. I'm sure he resembles you. Come… Come in for a coffee? I have a very important meeting right now, maybe later. Okay, I'll come to your place for a coffee when you're back. - Morning, Mohamed. - Good morning, Mr. Habib. Your ID card! Your ID card! What? Show me your ID card now! Get up! On your feet! What's wrong? - You're from Jendouba? - Yes. - What are you doing in Tunis? - What do you mean? Shut your mouth and just answer the question. Do I need a visa to move around my own country? Shut up. Just answer the question! - I have a job interview. - What job? - Plumber. - A job interview for a plumber? - Yes. - Do you have a PhD in plumbing as well? We're not free in our own country? Come with me! - Come on! - Let go of me. Please take it easy, it's okay. What's your bloody problem? You're a police officer and you're doing your job. The people running this country created a system to make us turn against each other. We are all victims of this regime! Please, just let him go. I'm going to arrest both of you now and show you how the system works! We can't let them make us hate each other. Stop this nonsense. They're forcing this country to its knees. Shut your mouth. They're brutalizing people. They're sucking the life out of this country. - They're robbing this country. - Shut your mouth. It won't last! Their days are numbered. Shut your mouth. Power to the people, we decide our future! We won't allow them to divide us. - We can't let them divide us! - Shut up! We will never let them make us hate each other. The revolution is coming! - The revolution is coming! - Get out. - You're victims too! - Just go away. - You're victims too! - Go away. Get out of here! Time is up. Hand back your exam sheets, please. I said time is up! Hello, Mohamed, when did Dad go out? - Not long ago. - How was he when he left? - As usual. - What was he wearing? His suit and he had his briefcase with him. - Call me when he comes back. - Sure, don't worry. Mr. Habib, not again, please! - Lotfi, please. - We can't do this every day! - He's going to meet me today. - You know what happened yesterday! This is my last attempt. I have to meet the prosecutor today. I know, I understand. But just go, you're going to get me into trouble. I'm a lawyer, and I have the right to enter the court. I can't let you in. Hold on there! - I have a hearing. - What time? Show me your ID card. Mr. Habib! Mr. Ali! I need five minutes of your time, please. Mr. Ali! Mr. Ali! Only you can bring justice for the Tunisians! Only you can make sure the truth is heard! Mr. Ali! They've forgotten to seek justice for the oppressed! They're protecting the abusers, what about the victims? - Just walk. - What about justice for the victims? Truth, justice… then we can have reconciliation! "When the people have the will to live, destiny must surely respond." "Oppression shall then vanish. Chains are certain to break." Truth, justice… then we can have reconciliation! Then we can have reconciliation! Mr. Habib, please don't come back here again. You can't keep on doing this. Do you have any relatives who can help? Ahmed, what are you doing? Give me that phone! - What do you need it for? - Nothing. It's not allowed here! - I know. - So what are you doing? I wanted to check on my dad. You're staying with your dad this week? Yes. Okay, check on him quickly. Thanks! - Let me help you, Mr. Habib. - No, thank you! Hi, Ahmed, I didn't see your call. Hope the exams are going well. Where have you been, Dad? Answer me, Dad, where did you go? Aren't… Aren't you supposed to be at school now? You promised me you'd stay home! - I went to the market. - No! You went back to see him, like yesterday! You've been trying for months! Why today? You should stay safe. There's only one day to go. I just went to the market, you go and rest now, I'll make you some food. Why, Dad? Why take risks? Stop talking and go study. - Tomorrow... - Stop talking, I said! Truth… Truth, justice… then we can have reconciliation… Truth, justice… then we can have reconciliation… Truth, justice… then we can have reconciliation… Reconciliation comes after… Ahmed, let's eat. You have to eat well to be able to concentrate. I'm worried about you, Dad. How did the exams go this morning? Please, Dad… Why take the risk? We've waited for so long to get you a place in a hospital… - Don't you see how worried I am? - Yes, I do. But I'm fine. You must stay at home this afternoon. I wanted to try one last time. You can count on me. Don't worry… I won't go out. - I'm not going to school. - Why? I'm staying with you. No, you go to school, focus on your exams and I'll stay here. I'm not going out. Plus… Plus, I won't be here by myself. Saadia is coming by… for a cup of tea. What's the matter? You're not jealous of her, are you? Nothing's going on between us… we just enjoy each other's company. No, Mum, I can't go to school and leave him alone. No, you have to go. Please, Ahmed, you can't miss your exams. Mum, Dad is not well! Nothing will happen to your dad. Just don't worry. Don't worry? Anything could happen to him outside. You focus on your exams and I'll come to see him and speak to him. You promise you'll come? Yes, I will, I promise. Don't be late for school. All right. Ahmed! Two cups of tea, please. I'm so happy you came. So am I, Mr. Habib. Just call me Habib, please. Okay, sure. No, not at all, he's so easygoing. I love Ahmed so much, he takes care of everything. Sometimes I feel he's the father… and I'm the son. Tomorrow then? Tomorrow… But I'm fine, I won't be staying long. Do you know why I wanted to see you today? For a cup of tea? Because I'm going to miss you. Me too, Saadia. Are you still in touch with your ex? I can't remember the last time I saw her. Doesn't she even check on Ahmed? This time Ahmed is staying a whole week with me, but usually she brings him on the weekends, drops him off downstairs and leaves. I can't believe she let go of you! I wish I could spend more time with him. Put it here. Aren't you going to say hello to Saadia? Hi, Saadia. I'm always talking to you about my son, I'm glad you're finally meeting him. When are you coming? I'll just finish what I'm doing and I'll come over. You just go to school and I'll take care of this. Okay, hurry, please. Where were you? Saadia wanted to say goodbye. I was on the phone. - Off to school? - Yes. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get good grades, as usual. …there are thousands of protestors in the streets… …against the violence of the police… …violent altercations between police and protestors… …many wounded… …the protests that started in Sidi Bouzid have spread all around the country… - Thanks. I'm fine… - We want the downfall of the regime! …the anti-corruption protests are faced with brutal violence, real bullets have been fired at peaceful protesters… …human rights lawyers have been asking the government to stop the violence against the peaceful protests… in the latest developments in the city. A security source told Al-Ghad channel… Hachem! They're assaulting innocent people! They want to destroy this country! - They want to destroy... - Calm down, please! Why did you turn off the TV, where's the news gone? What news? - It's okay, come in. - I know what they want! - I know what they want. I know them. - I understand. - Come in, sit down. - I know them… - I know them. - Sit down. Sit down. Calm down. Come on, sit down! Don't worry, sit down. It's all good. Don't worry! Have a sip of water, Habib. The news will start again in an hour. We'll watch it then. They started attacking the protestors, next they'll grab them from their homes and arrest them one by one. I know how they do things. They'll be coming for me now. No one will come to hurt you here, you have nothing to worry about. I'm not worried about myself, I fear for Ahmed. Have another sip of water. - Is that your phone? - Yes. - Is it on? - Yes. - Is it really on? - Yes. Turn it off! They're spying on us. - Turn it off! - All right, it's off now. But… Your son is growing so fast. He really looks like you. - He looks like me? - He does. - Ahmed? - Yes, he's a good boy. God bless him. Why don't you stay for dinner? I'll make the spicy stew you like. Not today. Another time maybe. Habib! Habib! Habib! Habib! Habib! Habib! Habib! Your house is flooded. Stop it. Habib, stop it! Stop! I need to clean up before Ahmed comes back. We have to talk. You going out this afternoon? - Would you like some tea? - I didn't come for tea! I left work to check up on you! You work too much, take a day off. Do you know why I came here today? - Because you wanted to see me? - No! Because your son is worried about you! I love spending time with Ahmed. - Are you taking your pills? - I can rely on him for everything. You know we argued about him staying with you? Instead of studying, he's worried about getting you to a hospital tomorrow. You decided to leave and took Ahmed with you. Don't leave this apartment until tomorrow morning. You think with your husband's money you can push him away from me. - You're not well! - Ahmed wants to be with me. Ahmed. Did you ever care about Ahmed? Or about me? Or even about yourself? Your only concern is justice for the victims! Ahmed and I are your victims! I'll get justice for the victims of the dictatorship, each one of them! What's this nonsense? Ben Ali and his gang will be brought to justice. Lamia, the revolution is coming. You're driving me crazy! What revolution? Let me show you. Lamia! What's all this? Can you explain this to me? These articles? Read this, "We will get justice for all the victims of the former regime." Got it? Former regime? It means Ben Ali is gone! It's over. You understand? Read here, "Ten years after the revolution." It's over. No more revolution, it's all over! Do you get it? The revolution already happened! The revolution is coming and justice will be served. Justice will be served? So these make no sense then. No, Lamia, please! - No, Lamia, please! - No need for these! Let's get rid of them! That guy will help me defend the victims! No need for these, then! He will help me get justice for the victims. All in the bin, we don't need them anymore! There we go! I'm warning you, you go to the hospital tomorrow or you'll never see your son again! Never again! I want this. Hi. - Hello, Mr. Habib. - A pack of cigarettes, please. Sure. Here you go. Sorry… I forgot my wallet. Don't worry, Ahmed can pay me later. Thanks. Isn't he that human rights lawyer? Thanks. You okay? I went to see your dad, all is good, I'll keep in contact with him. I'll speak to you later. Does that mean it's okay? Yes, Dad's going to be hospitalized tomorrow. They'll take care of him, give him the necessary treatments. Tomorrow everything will be okay. Sometimes it seems like tomorrow will never come. - I'll call you later. - Okay. Dad! Dad! I WON'T BE LATE. THIS IS IN CASE YOU NEED ANYTHING. - I'll call you if I see him. - Thanks. Hi, Mum. How was the exam? It went well. Was Dad fine when you saw him? Why, what did he tell you? Nothing, I just wanted to make sure it went well. Where are you now? I just came down to the shop, Dad's at home alone. - I'll call you later. Bye. - Bye-bye. - Mr. Ali! - Stop, what are you doing? Just a minute, Mr. Ali, I want to talk to you about something very important. A minute of your time, please. Let him speak. Mr. Habib Ben Amor, welcome to my house, what can I do for you? I have evidence incriminating officials from the former regime in acts of torture. These officials are still running free and are still in high positions. Here. We have closed most of these cases. I'm aware of these issues, but they're not a priority. But the victims deserve justice and those responsible should be punished. The Tunisians are relying on you to give them back their faith in their judicial system. The glorious revolution happened and we're all proud of it. Of course, any citizen who was oppressed deserves justice, but it's not reasonable to keep hanging on to the past, it's time to turn to the future. How can we move on while wounds from the past are still open? We have a country to run… starving families to feed. Our priorities have changed. My advice is to forget about the past, concentrate on the future and forget about playing the hero. I'm no hero. Yes, I was tortured in jail, but I'm still alive. Some people died and left families behind. It's the duty of the Tunisian judiciary to seek justice for the victims. These are your own words, Mr. Ali… Look. Didn't you say, "We will get justice for all the victims of the old regime." These are your own words, aren't they? Answer me. Where are you going? There are thousands of victims. Who will get them justice? Go away! Mohamed Bahri was killed and left four kids behind. Larbi Ben Belgacem and his brother died under torture. Samira Lahmar disappeared on June 5th, 2007, and there's no trace of her, and so many others. Tunisians want the truth! Sooner or later, the truth will come out! Shut your mouth. We told you to go away. "Old and young of Tunisia, rise up for her might and glory." "There is no place for traitors in Tunisia." "Only for those who defend her!" "We live and die for her glory." "A life of dignity or a death of greatness." "A life of dignity or a death of greatness." I brought you the sweets you like. - Thanks. - Ahmed, don't worry. Maybe he had something to do. - I hope so. - I'll stay and wait with you. All right, come in. Don't worry. He's probably on his way. There he is! Have a speedy recovery! Thanks. Let me do it. - Did you eat? - No. - Let me get you something. - Not now. I need a bath. I need to be presentable tomorrow. Ahmed… don't worry about the exams… I know you did your best. Look at me. You know how proud I am of you. I know. Don't cry, Ahmed. Don't worry. You always pass with good grades. Don't be afraid, my son. Let me help you. I'll run the bath. I just heard what happened. Why did they do this to you? Sooner or later, the truth will come out. What are you talking about? You can't hide anything from me. You know that. Let me see. Damn them. They've battered you. Saadia… Ahmed is here. - Let me go then. - Saadia! Yes? Next time, okay? The house needs painting. You'll help me? Of course. I want it to be perfect when you stay with me after I come back. I just want you to get better. Do they hurt? On the contrary, they taught me to be patient… they made me immune to pain. Ahmed… I don't want to cause you pain anymore. It's not your fault, Dad. I know that what you suffered at their hands made you like this. When you get well, they won't be able to ignore what you say anymore. Give me your hand. Eat, Dad, it's getting cold. My clothes got dirty today. I have to take them with me to clean them. You won't be needing them. Who knows? Ahmed, put that bread down! - It's not the bread I bought. - What? - They came in and changed it. - It's the bread you bought. They want to kill me. They want to get rid of me. They want to poison me. Ahmed, go to your room! Hi, Mum. What are you doing? Just had my dinner, I'm going to bed. Is your dad calm? He's okay. Hachem is taking us at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. Call me before you leave. I'll be there when you arrive. Aren't you coming? Aren't you going to join us? Hachem will be with you. I prefer to stay out of the way. I wish you'd be kinder to Dad sometimes. Anyway, goodnight. Ahmed, please… I just don't want to put more pressure on him. Goodnight. See you tomorrow. Dad… don't forget those. I won't need them. - Did you pack your shoes? - They're in the bag. Keep this with you. These are the original documents. I don't know when I'll get out. What shall I do with them? Keep them safe, Ahmed. It belongs to all Tunisians. One day the truth will come out. Go to bed and try to rest. - Good night. - Good night. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Ahmed! Ahmed! I needed some fresh air… Everything's okay. I'm sorry, Ahmed. Don't be. I love you as you are, Dad. Let's get ready. - Good morning. - Morning. - Are you ready? - Yes. Okay. Dad! Hachem is here. I'll be with you in a minute. I'll take the suitcase down. Careful. - Good morning. - Morning. - Are you traveling? - No, just a short break. - Have a nice day! - Same to you. Ahmed. - Give me the keys. - Why? - I forgot my phone. - I'll get it for you. Don't worry about the plants, I'll look after them. And don't forget the spicy stew when you come back. Don't worry about anything. Habib Ben Amor, you need to come with us to the police station. - Why? - No questions, please. I don't understand. Why should I come with you? You tried to break into the High Prosecutor's house and threatened him. Take him! No, I didn't try to break into the High Prosecutor's house! I can't go with you. He has an appointment at hospital, he's been waiting for it for ages! He shouldn't have done what he did. Take him. - Just a minute! A minute. - Take him! I want to see my son, please! I want to see my son, please just a minute! Ahmed! Ahmed! Ahmed! Ahmed! Ahmed! Ahmed! What's happening? Where is he going? Why are you arresting him? Why are you taking him? Answer me! Where are you taking him? Dad! Dad! I promise the truth will come out. I promise everyone will know what happened! You can rely on me, everyone will know the truth. You can rely on me, everyone will know the truth. You can rely on me… FOLLOWING THE FALL OF THE DICTATORSHIP AFTER THE JAN. 14TH REVOLUTION IN 2011, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THE PREVIOUS REGIMES' VICTIMS, WHO SUFFERED SERIOUS HARM LIKE BEATINGS AND TORTURE, DEMANDED TO BE HEARD. BUT TODAY IN 2021, TEN YEARS AFTER THE REVOLUTION, NO SINGLE PUBLISHED CASE AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS OFFENDERS HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE REGIME. AND ON JULY 25TH, 2021, PEOPLE TOOK TO THE STREETS TO GAIN GROUND AMONG CHALLENGES IN THE FACE OF REVOLUTION'S ENTITLEMENTS. FOR THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER AND FATHER, AZIZA AND AHMAD
