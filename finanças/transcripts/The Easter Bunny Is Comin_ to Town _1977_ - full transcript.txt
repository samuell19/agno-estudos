Announcer: TODAY, CHILDREN EVERYWHERE ARE MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR AN EVENT OF WORLD-SHAKING SIGNIFICANCE-- THE ANNUAL VISIT OF THE EASTER BUNNY, WHO WILL BE RIDING INTO TOWN ON HIS NOW-FAMOUS STEAM ENGINE EASTER SUNDAY MORNING AT QUARTER TO DAWN. INFORMED SOURCES REPORT THAT LEGIONS OF JUNIOR CITIZENS ARE STRAIGHTENING THEIR BONNETS, SHINING UP THEIR SHOES, AND MAKING MONUMENTAL VOWS NOT TO PEEK WHEN THE BUNNY HIDES THE EGGS. MEANWHILE, LETTERS BY THE THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN FLOODING POSTAL FACILITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. [WHISTLE BLOWS] HELLO! EASTER'S COMIN', EASTER'S COMIN', EASTER'S COMIN', EASTER'S COMIN'. WELL, HELLO THERE! GREAT TO SEE YA. IT SURE IS. HOW'VE YOU BEEN? Child: GREAT! TERRIFIC! WONDERFUL! WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, I'VE COME UP IN THE WORLD. I DON'T TRAVEL BY PUTT-PUTT ANYMORE.

WELL, THIS TIME I'VE GOT A LOAD OF EASTER EGGS AND JELLY BEANS AND, OF COURSE, TONS AND TONS OF MAIL, ALL FOR THE EASTER BUNNY. WHY, HE GETS ALMOST AS MUCH AS SANTA. AND EVERY YEAR, THEY'RE THE SAME. SOME CHILDREN ASK FOR COLORED EGGS, OTHERS FOR TOY BUNNIES OR CANDY, BUT A LOT ASK QUESTIONS, LIKE THIS ONE, FOR INSTANCE. I BET ONE OF YOU WROTE IT. Child reads: "WHERE DID THE EASTER BUNNY COME FROM?" Second Child: MY TURN! NOW, HOLD ON. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW, I CAN TELL YOU. HE CERTAINLY CAN. HE CERTAINLY CAN. HE CERTAINLY CAN.

WELL, IT ALL BEGAN MANY YEARS AGO, FAR, FAR AWAY, WAY OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BIG ROCK MOUNTAIN. THERE, SETTLED SNUGLY IN A LITTLE VALLEY, WAS A FANTASTIC VILLAGE KNOWN AS...KIDVILLE. NOW, THE REASON IT WAS KNOWN AS KIDVILLE WAS BECAUSE NO ONE BUT CHILDREN LIVED THERE. A SPUNKY, BRAVE, RAGTAG LITTLE COMMUNITY OF YOUNG FELLAS AND GIRLS AND NO GROWNUPS AT ALL. WHY, THERE WAS A KID MAYOR AND A KID POLICEMAN... AND FIREMEN... AND EVEN A KID MAILMAN. HEH! YEAH. THAT'S ME WAY BACK WHEN. THAT'S HOW COME I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL. NOT ONE GROWNUP IN THE WHOLE SHEBANG. SEE, ALL THE CHILDREN WERE ORPHANS, AND THEY HAD GATHERED TOGETHER IN THIS REMOTE LITTLE VALLEY, CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD BY BIG ROCK MOUNTAIN, TO MAKE A LIFE FOR THEMSELVES. SOMETIMES IT WAS LONELY, AND SOMETIMES... IT WAS SCARY. [HEAVY FOOTSTEPS] LIKE WHEN BIG OLD GADZOOKS RUMBLED AROUND THE MOUNTAIN TO BOTHER THEM. GRRR. GADZOOKS, GIANT BEAR WHO LIVED IN A LONELY CAVE ON BIG ROCK MOUNTAIN. HE'D USUALLY SHOW UP ON HOLIDAYS, AND IF IT WAS CHRISTMAS, HE'D TAKE ALL THE KIDS' TOYS. IF IT WAS, SAY, HALLOWEEN, HE'D TAKE THEIR PUMPKINS. AND IF IT WAS SOMEBODY'S BIRTHDAY, HE'D TAKE THE CAKE. YES, SIR. GRRR. BUT ASIDE FROM THE PROBLEMS WITH GADZOOKS, IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD LIFE-- KIND AND PEACEFUL AND SOMETIMES FULL OF FUN. EVERYBODY SHARED EVERYTHING AND WORSHIPPED THE LORD IN THEIR OWN WAY. [BELL RINGS] THAT'S HOW THEY FOUND THE BUNNY RABBIT. Boy: IT'S A BABY BUNNY! [CRYING] WE WON'T HURT YOU, LITTLE FELLOW. ARE YOU ALONE? UH-HUH. WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS? I DUNNO. YOU HAVE NO MOMMY AND DADDY? ARE--ARE YOU AN ORPHAN, TOO? JUST LIKE US. AW, POOR LITTLE THING. WHAT'LL WE CALL HIM? DO YOU HAVE A NAME? HE SURE LIKES THE SUN. THAT'S IT! WE'LL CALL HIM SUNNY! SUNNY! HE LIKES HIS NAME. All: YAY! SUNNY! Mr. Cluger: AND SO, HE WAS NAMED AFTER THE EASTER MORNING SUNRISE AND THE REBIRTH OF LIFE IT REPRESENTED. HE WAS TAKEN BACK TO KIDVILLE AND BECAME THE TOWN'S OFFICIAL PET. NOW, RABBITS GROW MUCH FASTER THAN KIDS, AND BEING ONE RABBIT AMONG A LOT OF KIDS, LITTLE SUNNY GREW MORE LIKE A KID THAN A BUNNY. BUT SOON HE WAS 1 YEAR OLD, FULL GROWN, AND AS BRIGHT AND AS SMART AS ANYBODY IN KIDVILLE. HE WAS A BORN LEADER. AND THAT VERY SAME AFTERNOON AT THE TOWN MEETING... AND I SAY KIDVILLE'S GOT TO EXPAND. WE'VE GOT TO SEND THE THINGS WE MAKE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND GET THE THINGS WE NEED IN EXCHANGE. WHAT THINGS, SUNNY? UH, WELL, THERE'S OUR EGGS. HOW ABOUT OUR EGGS? NO EGGS IN THE WORLD CAN TOP KIDVILLE EGGS. Kids: YAY! Mr. Cluger: HE WAS RIGHT. I GUESS THOSE WONDERFUL KIDVILLE EGGS WERE ABOUT THE BEST EVER... BIG AND WHITE AND BEAUTIFUL. THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE HENDREW SISTERS. THREE TRULY REMARKABLE CHICKENS, THE QUEENS OF THE CHICKEN COOP. Child: WHAT CAME FIRST, MR. CLUGER, THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG? Mr. Cluger: GIRLS, IF YOU PLEASE. REALLY! WHAT A QUESTION TO ASK US. I MEAN, DID YOU EVER?

Mr. Cluger: AND THE NEXT DAY, BRIGHT AND EARLY, HE SET OFF TO SPREAD THE GOOD WORD ABOUT KIDVILLE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. IT WAS EASTER MORNING, JUST ONE YEAR AFTER HE HAD BEEN FOUND. FAREWELL, KIDS. I'M OFF TO--TO... Kids: WHERE? UM, WELL, I'LL FIND SOMETHING. FAREWELL. Kids: BYE! HOWDY, NEIGHBOR! W--WHO ARE YOU? HALLELUJAH'S THE NAME. HALLELUJAH H. JONES. I'M SUNNY. CLEVER NAME.

Mr. Cluger: GADZOOKS! IT WAS GADZOOKS. GADZOOKS! I WANT THEM EGGS! GRRR. HELP! Mr. Cluger: SUNNY KEPT ON HOPPIN' DOWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, RIGHT UP TO THE GATES OF TOWN. TOWN WAS THE MOST DISMAL, UNPLEASANT PLACE SUNNY HAD EVER SEEN. NOBODY LAUGHED, EVERYBODY DRESSED IN BLACK, AND PRETTY FLOWERS WERE AGAINST THE LAW. EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN? SHH! CHILDREN ARE AGAINST THE LAW. AS SOON AS A LITTLE BOY OR GIRL GETS BORN HERE, THE WHOLE FAMILY'S GOT TO MOVE AWAY. THAT'S TERRIBLE. SHH! I AGREE. WHO MAKES THESE LAWS? SHH! HIM... AND HER. Mr. Cluger: KING BRUCE THE FRAIL, ONLY 7 YEARS OLD, AND HIS AUNT THE DOWAGER DUCHESS LILY LONGTOOTH. HE WAS THE KING, BUT IT WAS LILY WHO REALLY RULED TOWN. BUT--BUT MUST I, AUNT LILY? YOU WILL DO AS I TELL YOU. EAT YOUR BEANS. THAT'S ALL ANYBODY EATS IN THIS KINGDOM. BEANS, BEANS, AND MORE BEANS! I THINK BEANS ARE SUFFICIENT, AND WHAT I THINK IS SO. NOW, EAT YOUR BEANS.

YOUR MAJESTY. [DOOR SHUTS] NO WONDER HALLELUJAH SAID THOSE EGGS WOULD BE A HIT HERE. [SPLASH] [SPLASH] HEY, GOOD ONE! Mr. Cluger: NOW, OF COURSE, THE WHOLE PROBLEM WAS GETTING THOSE EGGS PAST GADZOOKS. IT WAS OLD HALLELUJAH JONES WHO CAME UP WITH THE SOLUTION. SEE? THEY'RE DISGUISED. THAT DUMB OL' BEAR WON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. Child: THE FIRST COLORED EASTER EGGS! Mr. Cluger: THE VERY FIRST. LITTLE SUNNY HAD NO IDEA HE AND HALLELUJAH WERE STARTING A TRADITION. [HEAVY FOOTSTEPS] Mr. Cluger: SO HE STARTED OVER THAT MOUNTAIN AGAIN WITH A FRESH SUPPLY OF DISGUISED EGGS ON HIS WAY BACK TO TOWN. GRRR. RABBIT! GADZOOKS! ANY MORE EGGS, BUNNY R--R--RABBIT? GRRR.

UH, GOOD QUESTION. LET'S SEE. FIRST YOU HOLD IT UP AND LOOK AT IT, AND THEN YOU SAY, "OOH! ISN'T THAT PRETTY?" OOH! ISN'T THAT PRETTY? YEAH, THEN YOU SORT OF LOOK CONCERNED AND SAY, "SEEMS A SHAME TO EAT IT." SEEMS A SHAME TO EAT IT. UH-HUH. THEN YOU KIND OF THINK IT OVER, AND YOU SAY, "HECK! THAT'S WHAT EASTER EGGS ARE FOR." HECK! THAT'S WHAT EASTER EGGS ARE FOR. HA HA HA! YEAH! Child: THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAPPENS AT MY HOUSE! Mr. Cluger: MINE, TOO. THEN YOU SORT OF PEEL THE COLORED SHELL OFF, AND IF YOU'RE A REAL EASTER EGG EXPERT, YOU KEEP IT ALL IN ONE PIECE. I'M AN EXPERT! I'M AN EXPERT! NOW DO WE EAT THEM? NOT THE WHOLE DARN THING AT ONCE! FIRST YOU KIND OF NIBBLE AT THE WHITE, THEN, WHEN YOU GOT NOTHING LEFT BUT THE YOKE, YOU SORT OF CONSIDER IT, STUDY IT, SNIFF IT A LITTLE. [SNIFFING] WONDER ABOUT ITS MAGIC AND COLOR AND...

Mr. Cluger: SUNNY KEPT HIS WORD, AND FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS HE LABORED WITH HERBERT THE BAKER AND HALLELUJAH JONES, TRYING TO MAKE AN EASTER BEAN. OH, THEY HAD MANY FAILURES, BUT THEN ONE DAY...

AND TO KING BRUCE AND THE OTHERS, THOSE JELLY BEANS WERE ABOUT THE GREATEST INVENTION SINCE THE WHEEL. AND TO LINDA AND HERBERT, IT WAS AS IF THEY SUDDENLY HAD A MILLION GRANDMAS AND GRANDPAS AND AUNTS AND UNCLES. IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY THAT LADY LONGTOOTH DISCOVERED WHAT WAS GOING ON. WHAT'S THIS?! MORE EASTER EGGS? I DON'T BELIEVE IT! CHILDREN? HOW DARE THERE BE CHILDREN?! SOUND THE ALARM! GET THE CHILDREN! AND THAT RABBIT! THROW THEM IN THE DUNGEON. [GONG] GET THE CHILDREN.

HIS SECRET WEAPON, HE CALLED IT. WHOA! WHAT'S YOUR HURRY? EASTER'S ALMOST HERE. NEVER DID SEE SO MUCH ACTIVITY. YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW. EVEN IF WE DO GET ALL THIS STUFF INTO TOWN, OLD LADY LONGTOOTH WILL JUST GET SOME LAWS PASSED, AND ALL OUR WORK WILL BE FOR NOTHIN'. YA GOTTA WORK ON KING BRUCE. HE REALLY IS THE RULER. WHY, IF HE'D JUST TAKE A STAND... HE SEEMS ALL RIGHT WHEN I'M WITH HIM, BUT THE MINUTE HE'S ALONE, HE JUST CAN'T STAND UP TO HIS AUNT. HE NEEDS SOME KIND OF A FRIEND TO GIVE HIM COURAGE WHEN YOU AIN'T WITH HIM. I GOT IT! YOU GOT WHAT, MY FRIEND? I'M GOING RIGHT OVER TO THE KIDVILLE SEAMSTRESS AND PILLOW MAKER. AND WHEN HE SET OUT AGAIN ON EASTER MORNING, SUNNY HAD TO TAKE A WHOLE SAFARI WITH HIM TO CARRY ALL THE EGGS AND JELLY BEANS AND EASTER OUTFITS AND...SECRET WEAPONS. SECRET WEAPONS, SECRET WEAPONS, SECRET WEAPONS, SECRET WEAPONS, SECRET WEAPONS, SECRET WEAPONS. Mr. Cluger: BUT WHEN THEY GOT DOWN THE OTHER SIDE ON THE HILLSIDE JUST ABOVE TOWN... OH, NO! OH, NO! Soldiers: GET THE RABBIT. GET THE RABBIT. GET THE KIDS. GET THE KIDS. GET THE RABBIT. GET THE RABBIT. GET THE KIDS. I HALF EXPECTED THIS. THAT'S WHY I DEVISED... PLAN "E," "E" FOR EASTER.

GIVE ME A FOOT. HA HA HA! Mr. Cluger: YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS, DON'T YA? Child: THE FIRST CHOCOLATE EASTER BUNNY. [CHEERING] Mr. Cluger: SUNNY DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE GETTING INTO TOWN AFTER THAT. [APPLAUSE] Mr. Cluger: WELL, THAT EASTER WAS EVEN MORE JOYOUS THAN THE ONE BEFORE BECAUSE SUNNY THE EASTER BUNNY HAD EVEN MORE SURPRISES. WHEN THEY GOT THEIR NEW EASTER OUTFITS, THEY WERE SO HAPPY AND SURPRISED THAT THEY WENT RIGHT OUT TO THE MAIN STREET AND HELD--- Child: I KNOW. THE FIRST EASTER PARADE. Mr. Cluger: RIGHT, THEN SUNNY MADE HIS WAY INTO THE PALACE AND FOUND KING BRUCE. WHAT IS IT? I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE. Child: STUFFED EASTER TOYS, JUST LIKE I'VE GOT AT HOME. Mr. Cluger: THE VERY FIRST ONES. THAT'S WHAT ALL THE KID SEAMSTRESSES AND PILLOW STUFFERS WERE WORKING ON. NOW YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS STANDING BY YOUR SIDE WHEN YOU NEED COURAGE. YOU MAKE FOLKS SO HAPPY, SUNNY. I WISH I COULD MAKE EVERYBODY IN TOWN HAPPY NEXT EASTER. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU? BECAUSE I ALWAYS HAVE TO SNEAK IN, AND THAT MEANS I CAN'T BRING TOO MUCH. I GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO COME TO TOWN... ANYTIME, ANYWAY YOU WISH. Lily: DON'T YOU DARE! STAND UP TO HER, BRUCE. YOU CAN, YA KNOW. YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF FRIENDS BEHIND YOU NOW. WELL? I KNOW I OUTRANK YOU, AUNT LILY, BUT I FIND IT TRULY DIFFICULT TO DO SO RIGHT NOW. AW, NO. I GIVE YOU CARTE BLANCHE. DO ANYTHING YOU WISH, FOR THE EASTER BUNNY MUST NOT COME TO TOWN NEXT YEAR! HA HA HA! WELL, EVERYBODY IN KIDVILLE WORKED NIGHT AND DAY GETTING READY FOR THAT BIG EASTER WHEN THE EASTER BUNNY WOULD REALLY COME TO TOWN. WHAT THEY DIDN'T REALIZE WAS THAT LADY LONGTOOTH HAD LOTS OF DIRTY TRICKS UP HER SLEEVE. DIRTY TRICKS, DIRTY TRICKS, DIRTY TRICKS, DIRTY TRICKS, DIRTY TRICKS, DIRTY TRICKS, DIRTY TRICKS, DIRTY TRICKS... Mr. Cluger: BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BRING, THEY HAD PLANNED TO USE GADZOOKS TO HELP THEM CARRY IT ALL, BUT LILY LONGTOOTH'S MEN HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA. WELL, DOC? HE'S BROKEN HIS BIG TOE. GONNA BE LAID UP FOR A WHILE. HE'LL NEVER MAKE EASTER. BUT WHAT'LL WE DO? HOW WILL I GET ALL THAT STUFF TO TOWN? SAY, I GOT AN IDEA, BETTER THAN EVEN A GIANT BEAR. HEY, WHAT'S THAT? WE BUILD A LITTLE RAILROAD FROM HERE TO TOWN, RIGHT OVER BIG ROCK MOUNTAIN. A RAILROAD? I'M PACKING MY BAGS. DITTO, KIDDO. LET'S HIT THE ROAD. THE BIG TIME AT LAST. All: STARDOM. GIRLS, PLEASE. A RAILROAD? BUT HOW? YOU LEAVE THAT TO ME. WHY, I WAS ONE OF THE BEST GANDY DANCERS OF ALL TIME. THAT'S AN OLD EXPRESSION FOR A GUY WHO LAYS TRACKS.

Mr. Cluger: BUT WHEN SUNNY GOT TO THE TRAIN YARD, ALL THE ENGINES IN THE ROUNDHOUSE THOUGHT THEY WERE TOO IMPORTANT TO PULL EASTER EGGS AND JELLY BEANS AND TOY ANIMALS. OH, PLEASE? IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT JOB. IMPORTANT? WHY, I'M THE 20th CENTURY LIMITED. AND I'M THE SUPER-DUPER CHIEF. AND I DELIVER COAL TO NEWCASTLE. DON'T BOTHER US, LITTLE BUNNY. Mr. Cluger: WELL, THEY HAD JUST ABOUT GIVEN UP WHEN ON A LITTLE RUSTY SIDING THEY SAW OUR OLD FRIEND CHUGS.

THE STORY OF THE FIRST EASTER RABBIT. AND, YOU KNOW, WE CAME WITHIN A HARE'S BREADTH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE THE PUN, OF NEVER HAVING AN EASTER RABBIT AT ALL. DON'T REMEMBER, DO YOU?

YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK OF A NAME FOR HIM. I WILL. BUT FOR NOW, I'LL CALL HIM STUFFY. OH, LOOK, IT SNOWED LAST NIGHT. CAN I GO OUTSIDE NOW, PLEASE? YES, DEAR, BUT BE SURE TO BUNDLE UP. G.B.: MEANWHILE, IN THE NEARBY WOODS, A TRIO OF REAL-LIVE RABBITS WERE HATCHING A RIDICULOUS CAPER. NOW, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT-- WE'RE GONNA DIG A LONG TUNNEL UNDER ALL THE CARROT PATCHES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHILE NOBODY'S AROUND. AND WHEN SPRING COMES, WE'RE GONNA COME BACK AND STEAL THE CARROTS FROM UNDERNEATH. TOTALLY UNDETECTED. WE COME NOT, FRIENDS, TO STEAL YOUR HEARTS, BUT YOUR CARROTS. G.B.: YOU'VE NOW MET SPATS, WHISKERS, AND FLOPS-- 3 OF THE SLICKEST CON BUNNIES AROUND. ALAS, MY MEN. BEHOLD THAT SILLY-LOOKING RABBIT SITTING OVER THERE. HEY, LOOK, HE'S STRANGE. HE HASN'T GOT ANY HIND LEGS. [SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF] HIS ODOR IS UNSNIFFABLE. UNDETECTABLE. HE AIN'T A RABBIT AT ALL. HE ISN'T REAL. BUT I AM REAL. I AM. I AM. G.B.: POOR STUFFY. HE KNEW HE WASN'T REAL LIKE THE OTHER RABBITS. AND THAT MADE HIM VERY UNHAPPY. BUT HE WAS GLINDA'S FAVORITE TOY, AND AS THE MONTHS PASSED, SO DID HIS SADNESS BECAUSE HE WAS LOVED. BUT ONE DAY, SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT WAS TO AFFECT EVERYBODY'S LIFE. LITTLE GLINDA TOOK ILL. I'M AFRAID IT'S SCARLET FEVER. OH, DEAR, MY POOR LITTLE GIRL. WHAT CAN I DO? WELL, THE FIRST THING IS TO BURN ALL OF THE BED CLOTHES. AND, OH, YES, THAT OLD STUFFED RABBIT. BURN IT ALL AT ONCE. G.B.: NOW, TAKING AWAY A CHILD'S FAVORITE TOY IS NO EASY MATTER. AND HOW WOULD SHE EVER EXPLAIN TO LITTLE GLINDA THAT STUFFY HAD TO BE-- WELL, YOU KNOW... EVEN I HATE TO SAY IT. OH, DEAR, IT'S GETTING LATE. I THINK I'LL LEAVE ALL THIS FOR BURNING TOMORROW. OUR RABBIT FRIEND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF, "WHAT'S THE USE OF BEING LOVED IF IT ALL ENDS LIKE THIS?" WHO--WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME IS CALLIOPE. I TAKE CARE OF ALL THE PLAYTHINGS THAT CHILDREN HAVE LOVED. AND WHEN THEY'RE OLD OR WORN OUT-- HA HA HA--THEN I COME AND TAKE THEM AWAY WITH ME AND TURN THEM INTO REAL. WHY? WASN'T I REAL BEFORE? YOU WERE REAL TO THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LOVED YOU. AND NOW YOU SHALL BE REAL TO EVERYONE. G.B.: STUFFY WAS MYSTIFIED, BUT HE HADN'T HEARD THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. NOW THAT YOU ARE REAL, I HAVE A SPECIAL MISSION FOR YOU. YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO BE THE FIRST EASTER RABBIT. BUT WHY ME? I'M NOBODY. AND WHY DO WE NEED AN EASTER RABBIT? G.B.: A GOOD QUESTION, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? BUT CALLIOPE HAD A GOOD ANSWER.

I'M OFF TO FIND EASTER VALLEY, WHERE THE GOLDEN EASTER LILY IS. AND-- HMM, GOLDEN EASTER LILY, EH? AHEM. EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT. [WHISPERING] SINCE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT IN THE BEST OF HEALTH, MY COMPANIONS AND I FEEL IT OUR DUTY TO ACCOMPANY YOU ON YOUR JOURNEY. GEE, THAT'S GREAT. LET'S GET STARTED. Calliope: ZERO. [ECHOES] BUT BEWARE OF ZERO? WHAT WAS THAT? OH, NOTHING. NOTHING AT ALL. G.B.: BUT IT WAS SOMETHING, INDEED, FOR THE EASTER RABBIT HAD REMEMBERED CALLIOPE'S WARNING ABOUT ZERO. BRR-UCE? BRR-UCE? I'M COMING-- OOH-OOH--ZERO-O-O! BRR-UCE? WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT THE ROAD INTO EASTER VALLEY? DID THE ELVES KNOW ANYTHING? NOT A THING. NOT A THING. I'D GIVE UP. G.B.: YOU SEE, ZERO AND BRR-UCE WERE IN CHARGE OF KEEPING THE NORTH POLE NICE AND WHITE. EVERYTHING WAS ALL LOVELY AND COVERED WITH SNOW EXCEPT EASTER VALLEY. ZERO HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE SECRET ROAD INTO EASTER VALLEY, AND SO IT STAYED GREEN ALL THE YEAR LONG. WE CAN'T GIVE UP, BRR-UCE. WE JUST CAN'T. THERE HAS TO BE A WAY. HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH. HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH. G.B.: WELL, BY THE TIME OUR FRIENDS HAD REACHED THE THIRD MOUNTAIN, THEY WERE TOTALLY EXHAUSTED AND READY TO TURN BACK. [WHISTLING SOUNDS] SAY, IT SEEMS THAT BIRD IS INDICATING A DIRECTION TO FOLLOW. WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO LOSE? Calliope: SOMEONE WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY. [BIRD CONTINUES WHISTLING] SHE'S LEADING US AWAY FROM THE WALL. IF YOU ASK ME, WE'RE BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE. WHAT DO YOU THINK, FLOPS? I'D SAY WE WERE BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE. [WHISTLING] THE TREE. IT MUST BE HOLLOW. WHY DOESN'T ONE OF US GIVE IT A TRY? I SHALL BE AS EXPEDITIOUS AS POSSIBLE. AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT, TOO.

YOU SEE, I'M ALL FINISHED WITH MY JOB, AND I HAD A LITTLE SPARE TIME, SO I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU GET STARTED. BUT WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB IN TIME. THERE ARE SO MANY BOYS AND GIRLS ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND WE ONLY HAVE A FEW WEEKS. WELL, WHY NOT PICK JUST ONE SMALL TOWN FOR A TEST? THEN, NEXT YEAR, YOU CAN TACKLE THEM ALL. THAT'S WHAT I DID FIRST TIME OUT. GREAT IDEA, SANTA. AND I KNOW JUST THE TOWN. EXCUSE ME FOR BUTTING INTO THE FESTIVITIES, SANTA, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR US? GIVING PRESENTS IS A TALENT. ONE THAT THE THREE OF YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO EXPLORE. WHY NOT TRY IT JUST ONCE, HMM? YOU CAN START BY GIVING JUST A LITTLE GIFT OF LOVE TO A CHILD. YOU'LL BE SURPRISED AT HOW MUCH YOU'LL GET BACK IN RETURN. YOU WON'T REGRET HELPING ME, FELLAS. JUST ONE THING, SANTA, SIR-- IS HE REALLY THE FIRST EASTER RABBIT? HEH HEH HEH. INDEED HE IS, SPATS. NOW I MUST BE OFF. BLITZEN. GOOD LUCK. HEH HEH. GOOD LUCK. WELL, THEY'VE GONE AND DONE IT, BRR-UCE. SOMEHOW THEY'VE MANAGED TO GET INTO EASTER VALLEY. AND THEY'RE BOUND TO FIND THE GOLDEN LILY. WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY IN. G.B.: CRAFTY OLD ZERO KNEW ONE THING THAT NO ONE HAD BOTHERED TO TELL THE NEW EASTER RABBIT-- THAT THE GOLDEN EASTER LILY KEPT THE VALLEY WARM AND GREEN ALL YEAR LONG. IF IT WERE TO DISAPPEAR, SPRINGTIME WOULD DISAPPEAR WITH IT. ♪ THERE'S THAT RABBIT ♪ ♪ PLAYING HIS EGG-ROLLING GAME... ♪ WHY SO GLUM, CHUM? OH, IT'S NOTHING. IT'S JUST THAT...

THE VALLEY AND THE GOLDEN LILY ARE MINE. GEE, ZERO, ARE YOU JUST GONNA LEAVE 'EM SNOWED IN LIKE THAT? OOH-OOH, THEY MAY NEVER GET OUT. BRR-UCE, WHO CARES? HEH HEH HEH. LET 'EM ALL FREEZE FOR ALL I CARE. HEH HEH HEH HEH. G.B.: BRR-UCE WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD DONE. BRR-UCE DECIDED THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING LEFT FOR HIM TO DO.
