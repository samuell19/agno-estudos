Ah, I put your service on in a few minutes Um, your shirt should be ready tomorrow, and Mother Superior insists that you get back to her today. Where's Monsignor Patio? He went to the Diocesan Luncheon, your Excellency. Until 6 o'clock? He had a Diocesan cocktail party after. I entered his correspondence for the day and it's on your desk. Sign them for me. Yes, your Excellency. Good afternoon, Bishop Campbell's Office. Hi. Hi Father...Goodbye. ..You see Mrs. Chainey, I've just been a priest for a little over a year now, I love my work Father, I know the Bishop can be difficult at times, but when you think of all the good work he's done... Then I just don't understand why he won't let me learn how to work a word-processor. Do you? I'm mean isn't this like I just need a change? Is that wrong? Well, I guess he has his reasons. Alright, everyone, closing time. Mr. Chu? Mr. Chu? Can you hear me? It's 6 o'clock. Enough of those for one day. If you want a ride home, Almost finished... Maybe tomorrow. You've been saying 'Maybe tomorrow' for almost 2 years. And one 'tomorrow' I'm gonna be right. Well? Did you ask him about the word-processing class? Honey, do you know where Al's bowl is? Catch it. Good Boy! ah, I'll just use a dish. And, I did ask. I'm proud of you. Don't be. He said no. The Bishop won't let you take the course? Why He can't afford to let me go for two weeks. It's not his fault. Well don't let him make you feel bad., Honey? Never mind that you run the whole Archdiocese practically by yourself. -And never mind that you only ask for... -Thanks, Nick.,, That makes me feel a lot better. You're welcome. look... Dinner tonight.. Sky's the limit. I'll cook, whatever you want. Why don't we just order in? Better yet, Then we can get started peeling the wallpaper What goes good with wallpaper? Chinese. Alright, I love Chinese. Then again Mrs. Lavin says She's sometimes takes her exercise classes to a great pizza place around the corner. Wonderful. Done. It's great I'm Starving. Then again Chinese is a little easier. What do you think? -Either one -No, you choose. You're pick. Chinese. Yeah, Chinese...Definately. First preview of layer five. Where would you place it? Early 30's? We're gonna be in our early 70's by the time we finish this. Nicky, we should have had a professional do it. What? And let them destroy this wonderful moment? Oh, that is ugly, huh? Let's sneak a peek at the next layer. No peeks. It's like a box of candy You can't just dive down to the bottom layer to see what's there. It's past my bedtime. So I'm gonna go upstairs and attempt to somehow fall asleep. Ok, well see Al out before you go up will ya? -He's getting kind of messy. -Come on Boy. Come on. Okay, okay. [music playing] [distant woman's voice] Jan! Jan! Come in here and look at this! Honey, come on it's time to go to bed. Look at this. Blood? Lipstick I think. A will. A will on the wall, undiscovered for 60 years. 'Maxie'. Gimme that. 'Maxie Malone' I wonder who he was? Some kid who stole his mother's lipstick and wrote on the wall. Let's leave it up for a while. It's like antique graffiti. 'Read it and weep' What could that mean? MRS. LAVIN: You hoo. Mrs. Lavin. -More food. -Please come in Mrs. Lavin! You radiate such a lovely aura Dear. [giggles] Thank you. Don't she Jonathan? Is Jonathan your husband? Not for about 47 years. Oh, I'm sorry I didn't know. Oh that's okay, He was dead a couple years before he knew it. -Thanks for the goodies -Yeah. Leftovers from my exercise class. It's the only way I can get them to move. Give 'em a Ding Dong, Make 'em feel guilty for eating it. Then you should see those ladies Burn! Oh my. Are you alright? Here why don't you sit down. Do you understand what it means? I can remember this, like it was yesterday. Like it was 5 minutes ago. -Jan, she know him. -Him?! Her was no him. That was a 'her' with a capital 'H' 'Maxine Malone' After all these years. Why did she write 'read it and weep'? We were a team, I was 'Trudy Lisko, The Toast of Frisco' and she was simply known all over town, as 'Maxie' We had a song and dance act over at the old 'Alcazar Theater' How did she die? Nick. No, no. It's good... ...it's good to remember. She took a break from the act... to do a bit part in a silent picture 'Flapper Melodies' She was only in this one big part scene but she was such a Hum Dinger They gave her a line. Did she die when she was making the movie? ah, no, no, no... the picture wasn't even out D.W. Griffith decided to screen test her for a starring role Maxie knew she was going to get it and the very night she was leaving for Hollywood, She threw a hell of a party got real... Tanked up... wrote that on the wall... Then she drove down the Coast Highway...Headed right into a tree, never even knew what hit her. Premonition...It had to be. Poor Maxie, never even got to see the one movie she was in. Oh, Mrs. Lavin, we didn't mean to bring up any sad memories. Oh, no. not at all Oh I contact Maxie All the time. She'll be thrilled such a nice young couple has her apartment... uncovered her wall... Maybe I'll go upstairs, and summon her spirit right now. I won't be able to reach Mr. Lavin it's passed his bedtime. Nicky... our landlady talks to spirits. [chuckles] It's a sad story though. -Mrs. Lavin? -No the wall. Whoo..The whole thing gives me the creeps. Honey? This is the last vestige of Maxie Malone. You're not gonna get one of your things about her... -Are you? -Of course not, she's been dead for ages Sombody should tell Mrs. Lavin that. [giggles] I'm going to bed. Goodnight, Honey. Goodnight, I'll clean up a little first. See ya tomorrow, Father. Bye. Guess what i have behind my back? [Jan panting] Two round trip tickets to Mexico? Silent film classics from the 20's I rented it. Maxie's movie. That was going to be my second guess. Oh I'm so sorry you have a rash, your Excellency ...Yeah, I specifically said 'No starch.' Come on. Yes. Goodnight, your Excellency. Just a little bit of baby powder. Alright, goodnight. I know, I know. ...but who else can he call? I'll sit down and open another bottle. -Yell if the party scene comes on. -Okay. Did yoiu like that? Was this good? Roll over...come on. Go. Roll over...Roll over. -Nicky... -Good Boy. -Okay. -I think this is it. Which one do you think she is? That's her, Jan [giggles] -So short. -Mrs.Lavin was right, though...Huh? -She had something. -Oh, so have I. -Great night. -Two baked potatoes... -Big eyes, huh? -bottle of wine...Nicky I'm gonna have to go to sleep, before I pass out. Good night, Honey. Well, Maxie Malone, you were something. You really were. VOICE: Nuts I missed it. -What Hun? -Look mister... I about killed myself getting back here. How's about turning it up again, would ya? Just my reel, I don't give a hoot about the rest of the picture. You hear something Al? I wanna see my picture, Fella. Come on, please. Okay...I'll play. My? My who? Me...Maxie Malone. So? What are you standing there for? Huh, Honey? The wine. Something in the wine. I knew I shouldn't have bought domestic. You're starting to get on my nerves. I'm here, you're awake and I wanna see my picture. You're not here. If you were here, I could see you. and I can't... so this whole thing is really a little absurd. -and I'm just gonna head... -If you'll stop yammering... I'll give it a shot. It takes a lot of juice. Oh God. Hey... Where's the projector? Oh... God. Aren't we past that point yet? Jan? -Honey? -No. it's still Maxie. But if calling me 'Jan Honey' will get you to put my movie on Jan... Honey?! My wa...my wife. Oh, good for you. Now, be a pal, put my movie on. It's a tape. Um... A va...a video tape. Here. What's this thing my movie's playing on? A television set. Smallest movie screen I ever saw. I was good! Wasn't I? Just like everybody said. Well...Hell, at least I saw my picture. Thanks. You're going away? I'm getting my mind back. It ain't you. It's me.

Still have been alive. These things happen all the time... You read about it in the papers. I realize they don't normally happen to people like me. Then you tell me , huh?

Jan, I had a profound experience tonight. Listen...Honey, I gotta tell you something... Please, please, please. Do you think I'm capable of a psychotic episode? You won't believe what happened. This isn't like the time we thought we saw moving lights in the sky. Jan it spoke to me, I gave her a glass of wine. What I think I saw has major implications. Honey, Honey..Please, please. My imagination, it's running wild. Okay...Listen to me. Sweetie...listen...huh... okay...okay...alright... I know...I'm calming down I am. I'm calming down. Listen... Honey... ...that feels good It does. It feels good. it's helping calm me down... sort of... ...Honey Please...listen to me...Jan? Honey, I know you're not taking this seriously. Could you do that a little to the left? There...Ohh That's how it should... God, I shouldn't be taking this seriously either. Oh yeah...that's a new one... Do that...do it some more.

Miss Sheffer, I've been meaning to talk to you A book scout came in with incunabula which I think would fit into our special collection... Mr Chaney, can we talk about business later? First of all, I think it's important that we get to know each other as people. May I call you Nick? Of course. Call me Ophelia. I see by your finger, that you're married. -Eight years. -Children? Not yet, We're considering one as soon as our budget allows Have you had a chance to read my Mylar cover proposal? You have wonderful eyes, Nick.

The 'Hollywood Special' stopped running years before you were born. Really? Okay, I got it! We can catch the early show at the 'Alcazar'. Honey, they stopped doing shows at the 'Alcazar' two years after Maxie and me stopped working there. Alice, you saw Maxie and me at the old 'Alcazar'... were we something? Or were we something? They don't have teams anymore now. No more teams. But never mind kiddo, we were great. You were great! Trudy, you and Maxie were really good. What's she talking about? Maxie... That's Trudy. Go on. Trudy is just a kid. I mean, she's younger than... What happened to her, Nicky? She got old, Maxie. If you don't get old, it means you died young. Trudy: Oh! That was quite a class. Sit down, take a load off. -Trudy? -What? Let me look at you. look at me? Why? Is there something funny? You look wonderful. Say... You wouldn't happen to have the music to the old 'Boston Creampie' would ya? [Mrs. Lavin: laughing] I haven't had that request in years. How come you know all this stuff about the old days? Ah, just a hobby. I was wild about this tune Maxie and me we used to do a number to it. Every time we did it, it brought down the house. You probably don't remember any of it, do ya? Like it was yesterday. ♫ Hiya Trudy. Read it and weep. Maxie? Honestly... I hate to leave you both like this But ah... I guess it's time I take a powder. You know, I..I just don't belong here anymore. I'm sorry if you didn't have much fun. Oh to be absolutely honest I haven't had so much fun in years. Well, ah... so long Sheik. Thanks for everything. It was a real gas. Honey... Honey, I feel like I'm... [sighs] Jan: It wasn't me. I mean it wasn't me It couldn't have been me. I...I wouldn't do anything like this. Drink, dance, get drunk, make o fool out of myself. It was her. Oooh... She was in my body. Honey, I told her to leave. Maxie Malone Was in my body, and you slept with her. No...not really. I...I...I mean it was you. Alright, it was her. -But... -I am a woman, Not a flop house. People don't just check-in and check-out whenever they feel like it. You're having an affair. No...come on. Once...once is not an 'affair' It was Maxie Malone in our bed that night. -we saw her damn movie. -I didn't know that. And you passed out and nothing happened. That was half a time, and then on the merry-go-round. I thought that was you, and the officer came. You thought that was me? doing you know what on a merry-go-round at 4AM in the morning? That's another half a time, and then today. That's two whole times. Do you want a divorce? What for? To marry Maxie Malone? [Jan weeping] -Ah, come on -No! I'm sorry, okay. I'm sorry. She's gone. She won't be back. I don't believe you. -Trust me. -No! No, she'll come back. if we start... You know, if we start, she's gonna come back. We'll give it a few days, and then you'll see that I'm right. Leave it on, I'm scared. -Don't!...Touch me. -Okay. Want another pillow? Four! Good shot, your Ex... good shot! I think we'll call that 70 yards, Sir! 70! Alright, wait one sec! Girls you be very careful He's gonna ht another one, just any second now. Okay, your Excellency, it's all clear I got a problem. -Bishop Campbell -Yes Jan? Do you believe in possession? Dlaczego nie? That means 'why not' in Polish. I'm taking lessons. I'm spending my vacation in Rome this summer. Your Excellency, I'm being possessed. Or..or at least I was yesterday I just had to talk to somebody about it. Oh now, possession is a very shadowy area. Jan, ah...It's very hard to prove. Even specialists go to great lengths to collect evidence. Real evidence. You can't just walk up to the church and say 'I'm being possessed by the Devil'. I'm not. I was possessed by Maxie Malone. A movie actress that died in 1927 She used to live in our new apartment but she hit a tree, and Nick and I watched one of her old movies and then she possessed me. and made me do terrible tihings. What kind of terrible things? Well...I... I got drunk... and I sang at a party... and I... made out with my husband... and I uh... told awful jokes, and I went on a joy ride. Oh, Jan. Jan... That's not known as possession... That's known as living. Now let me know if she makes your head spin round, and you start throwing up pea soup ah? I guess if you came to me with the same story I wouldn't believe you either. Now, you be a good girl and take a half-hour and lie down in the outside office and you'll feel better. Much better, huh? Come on now. There's the good girl. That's it...alright. ahh...interruptions Interruptions. Hi there! Is she still okay? Fine...fine, Mrs. Lavin, fine. And Maxie? Five days, no sign of her. Mmhmp! Nick, I've been thinking about it You were tricked. You didn't know. It's not your fault, not really. Thank you. You did like her though. Well, she was selfish, and childish, and exhausting. But fun. I gotta admit she was fun. She wasn't you though. Jan... We can not go on indeffinately like this. Now let's go upstairs. I'm cooking -If you would rather not. -No.... No, meet me upstairs. [Al whines] You stay. Jan: Was that as good as Maxie? Nick: There's no comparison. Oh Nick. Where were you born? -What? -Where were you born! -Kankakee, Illinois -What's your mother's maiden name? -O'Connell. -What's your Social security number? 265-06-3702 I love you. Mrs. Chaney. Mrs. Chaney? Oh...hello, father. Do you have a minute? I need to talk to you. Certainly. Can you imagine what it's like to have two personalities inside you? Frequently. One is normal, -wholesome and has values -And the other? The other... Has these incredible forbidden desires. -So he told you? -What? -About the possession. -Who? -His Excellency. -His Excellency? -How did he find out? -Because I told him. You've known all along? Well actually he said it wasn't possession at all. He told me it was simply living. He did? He did. But Mrs. Chaney It's getting worse. I mean, now... when I confiscate the girly magazines from the boys at school, before I burn them, I look at the center folds. I can't even look at staples without having impure thoughts. That's why a young piece of talent like you otta be out there living it up. Ya know, Friar Tuck if you dress up you'd be a cute little guy. That's very kind, Mrs. Chaney. But I know in my heart, I'm just not made for women. Why the heck not? You got all your parts working, don't you? Oh! -I get it! -You know this dress don't mean you're out of the running. This is...wonderful. You should be out on the town, having a great time of things. Don't stop. Keep going! Nothings happening! You're still a man's man, ain't ya. Yes, but I'm a man of God first! -Jan, have you made an appointment for me? -Thank you, your Excellency! Thank you! Thank you! By using Mrs. Chaney as your vessel, I have been cured. You're so wise and so, Wonderful. Thank you! And, thank you, Mrs. Chaney. Thank you. I will always appreciate what you've done for me. I have to go. I have to fill out some insurance forms. Funny guy. Reminds me of Fatty Arbuckle. Oh. He's a nice lad, but these adolescent obsessions of his... Nothing wrong with a good obsession, Bish. And not to change the subject, your Goodness, but...ah, I need a leave of absence. We can start with a couple of weeks. Jan, I thought i said this was not a good time. Now this discussion is as they say in polish 'koniec'. Finito. This discussion, as they say in English, is just startin'. It may not be a good time for you... But it's a swell time for me. Now, if you don't like it, you can, can me. Oh, Jan...this isn't like you. are you feeling alright? Sure, I'm hittin' on all sixes. hittin' on all sixes., huh? My, how colorful. Say, ah...Jan... Who's ah... Who's your favorite movie star? Rudy Valentine. What's it to ya? oh, just inquiring. Do you remember the year that World War II ended? We had a second one? Oh indeed. It was in all the papers. Not that, that would mean anything to you would it, Miss 1920's flapper! -Ahhh! -Ahhhhh! Ah! Ah! Get thee behind me Satan! Ahhh! Ahh! J.F.K. Mother Theresa and you won $43 from Rabbi Disenbaum in a poker game last week. Jan...Jan is that you? Oh, God. She was here, wasn't she? She came back...Oh God! Ah...Ah...Ahhh. It's alright my child. I never should have doubted you. She's gone...She's gone. Everything's gonna be fine now. See..She's gone. Please stop crying. Just sit there. Sit there rest and relax. for a while...and I'll...ah... I'll get you an aspirin, and everything's going to be fine. Fine...just, just fine. Fine...yes. [trembling] Get me the Exorcist from San Bernardino. The Exorcist from San Bernardino? Bishop: And if he's not there get the one from Beverly Hills. [phone buzzing] Rare books. Jan: Nicky, Maxie's back. I think the Bishop's planning something in the next room. Meet me in front of the pizza place. I'll be there as soon as I can. Mr Chaney?...Nick! Where are you running off to? -My wife needs help. -Oh, you can say that again. Never the less, we have a staff meeting in 10 minutes. It'll have to go on without me. Perhaps we can all go on without you, permanently. You don't understand. -My wife isn't... -Listen... I have had as much as I can understand of you and your wife. If you walk out that door -now you're fired. -Okay... Go a head, fire me. Fire me. I'm not a towel boy in a country club. I'm an expert in rare books. I'm a professional I'm paid to service the public's needs, not yours. All done. All finished! No kidding. Bitch. Honey, I got here as fast as I could. Look, I'm gonna take care of this. If we have to stay locked in a room for a month until she shows up. And when she does... We'll make her wish she was dead. Or have a good time trying. Right, Sheik? Ahhh! Where's my wife?! Listen, Dude. The paper is $1.50 You heard him. Pay the man for the paper -then get out of my way. -I'm warning you Maxie, I don't wanna have to resort to force. Well, one of us has to. Nick: Sorry. Nick: You have a flat! It has a flat! You hit that break! You stop that car. Please stop my car! Ma [foreign language film playing] Ma. Patron: Hey Lady, sit down. Patron: Sit down! Patron: You step on my foot, you stupid! You never told me they were in color. -You hit me. -Self defense Leave me alone. Let me watch. Usher: Tickets are five dollar! Maxie: Five dollars?! Nick: I paid for your newspaper. I'm not paying for your movie. Usher: Five dollar, five dollar...ten dollar Nick: Just a second, please. Usher: I only do my job! I know you have your problems... I know you have your desires... Fine! I have mine... so does Jan. Remember Jan? Nice woman. The woman I love. Not that I expect you to care too much about her. All I want to know, is why you've decided to come back. And then, -I'm gonna kill ya. -You can't kill me, I'm dead. The best thing you could do is kill your wife's body Which ain't a bad idea. It does run real fast though. I got to give her that. Well if you don't like it, Then get the hell out of it and leave us alone. look, I'm not putting her down. -She's fairly good. -Fairly good? But not as good as Maxie? You said it Brother, no comparison at all. You were there. Not there exactly. More like...eavesdropping. It was a slow night. You were jealous. You came back to get Jan in trouble because you were jealous. I'll be damned. Maybe I was just a little bit jealous, that's why I came back. But, it ain't why I'm staying. All bets are off. I was meant to have a career. A great big fat one. That's how it was supposed to happen. And that's how it's gonna happen. In color and sound. On a great big screen. Nick: The curtains. I'll kill her. Oh boy. I just got lucky. Oh and don't get hot under the collar, I'll pay you back for all the supplies -as soon as I get paid for my part. -What part? What do you think you're doing? Remember all those Dames struggling after some audition? Well, I came home, spruced up, went back and got in the line. Then all we had to do was the Charleston. It went from 50 girls, down to 10 girls, down to one girl, me. It's just a one day gig, but I think it's a real big show They got a Cowboy to train me and the director seems like a real hot shot. Anyway, I gotta get my beauty rest so I can do the best I can with the goods I'm stuck with. Wait! Wait! Whoa! What makes you think Jan's gonna allow this? You're gonna talk her into it. I'm gonna strip and hit the sack. -You wanna watch? -Dammit, don't do that to me. Maxie! Maxie, be reasonable. How am I going to talk Jan into this? It's one day. One day out of her whole life. Than I'll scram for real. I promise. She'll have to take the days off. That is, if not not both unemployed. And, she probably won't like what you've done to her hair. Not to mention the fact, that she's never been particularly fond of you. You're a bright boy, you'll think of something. I know I made a mess of things. And I know you've been wonderful to me... and I shouldn't... but I'm asking for a gift. It's not so bad. The being dead part, but it happens to everyone. But to be cut off like I was they keep saying... I'm so special, that I could've made it, but... I don't really know for sure. Please... help me prove this one thing to myself. One more day? Please. I will try... and that is all that I can promise. Thanks. Well... I'll leave you two alone now. Oh it's a 6AM call so don't let her stay up much later. I need her sleep. Hello. Ah! She's back. What happened? She ran away from me... and we saw a movie, but we didn't do anything I swear. She's never gonna leave, is she?! She wants a favor from you. If you say 'yes', it's a day and she promises not to come back. Wait let me guess. A day in the sack with you? One more day. To do a part... that she got herself in a movie. She almost got me fired! Do you know how that makes me feel?! If you're saying you don't exactly owe her a favor, - I'll tell her your decision... -Ahhh! ...is no. She really had a big day, didn't she? I wasn't around when she did that. Sorry. I can't be able to go to work looking like this. [sighs] I've got to make sure when I go to work, that the Bishop doesn't try to exorcise me. [sighs] I have to take the day off. Ah, ya better wait 'til you decide before you do that. She has a 6AM call. uhhh... [sighs] One day and it's over? -She swore? -She swore. She swore? She swore. [sighs] Ok...I'll do it. -Are you sure? -Yeah. I'll give her, her chance, and be done with it. I forgot to mention one little thing. She got me fired. In that case, we get the money from the movie. Alright, bring it right on over here. Producer: Miss Malone how are you? Very well, thank you.
