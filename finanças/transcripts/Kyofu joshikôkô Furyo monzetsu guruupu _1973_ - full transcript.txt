Here's a bra. Miss, how about this? It's cheap. It's cheap! It's a good deal! - What the fuck is this? - Shut up! You can see what it is. I don't want you guys to do business in the Red Rose clan's territory. You think being Red Rose makes you? You're just the pretentious elites of this school! - Do you think you're entitled? - Scum should behave appropriately. Go clean the toilets right now. - What are you doing? - Listen! The Red Rose clan is running Seiai School. We won't accept any kind of challenges. We can't accept it. Opposing the Red Rose clan means opposing the school. Don't you get it? Whatever! You want to challenge us? I'll show you who is superior today. Stop! Leader! Do you even have time to fight these idiots? Kinue! Today is the day when we elect the new leader of the Red Rose clan! I, Miya Saionji, would like to announce my retirement. I will be transferred to Hokkaido soon. Separating from you all makes me sad, but we have to proceed with our retirement ceremony. According to the policy, the candidates for the new leader are Kinue Hayami and Takako Nonaka. I will open the box. Takako Nonaka. Kinue Hayami. Takako Nonaka. Takako Nonaka. Kinue Hayami. Kinue Hayami. Takako Nonaka. Kinue Hayami. Takako Nonaka. Takako Nonaka: 5 Kinue Hayami: 4 According to the results, the new leader of the Red Rose clan is Takako Nonaka. Takako! Congratulations! Thank you. Everyone! The new leader has been elected by everyone. I won't be here anymore, but you have to support her to maintain Red Rose's reputation! Leave it to us! - Welcome. - Hello. I heard your father was transferred to Hokkaido. Yes. I wanted to have a farewell party for Miya. Papa, you will be late tonight too, right? Unfortunately, I have important business at work. Excuse me. Enjoy your time here. He is always in a rush. Takako! Even if we separate today, you can make it by yourself, right? Yes. No problem. I think you will do a better job as the leader than me. Just a little further. You'll be comfortable soon. Deplorable!! Three-Car Collision Drunk-Driver was Nonaka, a member of the Municipal Parliament 5-month pregnant woman... His qualification as a member of the Municipal Parliament is questionable... Reprehensible!! Member of the Municipal Parliament Nonaka died at the scene Papa was stupid, really stupid. Mother! What are you going to do from now on? Let's just settle for the damages to the crashed cars. We don't have enough money. I am going to compensate them properly. - I will quit school and start working. - What are you talking about? No matter what happens, you shouldn't quit school. Excuse me. My condolences. Takako! It must be hard for you. Nonaka was such a good man. I never thought he'd get involved in such things. Yukiko Ogata was my secretary. You can blame my lack of supervision. It doesn't matter anymore. Nonaka and I were good colleagues. I would like to help you as much as possible, if you'll allow me. Thank you but no. I just wanted to help a friend of my daughter in trouble. I can learn life lessons from my daughter. Seiai Girls High School Nonaka, according to the meeting, you're transferred to Class D of Year 3 starting today. The trash class? You haven't paid any tuition for 2 months now. So, according to the school policy, we can't let you stay in Class A of Year 3. Go to Class D right now. Got it? - Nonaka! Got it? - Got it? I heard you've been transferred to the trash class. Takako! Unfortunately, you're no longer leader of the Red Rose clan. Unfortunately, that's the policy of the Red Rose clan. Everyone! Takako Nonaka has been transferred to Class D. Please welcome her to the class. I am Takako Nonaka. Since you're new in this class, you should greet us properly! I already did. Do you think that greeting was enough? This isn't the Red Rose clan. I want you to greet us with a pretty face. - Get it! - What are you doing?! Be a good girl! I'll turn you into a sexy woman who can seduce a prince. Any complaints? You must've been doing okay in the Red Rose clan. But here, you're just nobody. You think you can beat us by yourself?! Keep making her prettier! Good. This is for a white face. Keep going. The lips are next. Cute. Let's make her prettier! I'm going to do your eyebrows. What a pretty face! Welcome home. What's wrong, Takako? Did anything happen at school? Mother! I'm serious about quitting school. No way. You'll keep studying. You don't have to worry about anything. I'll go now. Heat up the snack in the fridge and eat. Mr. Shepherd! When will the next transaction take place? When American troops come back from Vietnam, you can get what you have want. I am looking forward to that. Let's earn a lot of money as long as the war lasts. But it is just too important. We have to be very careful. That's very important. We have to eliminate anything that might reveal our secrets. Just like Nonaka and Yukiko. Anyway, Mr. Hayami, what happened to the woman I asked for? Leave it to me. You are pretty mean. I never expected you'd be interested in the widow. The president? Immediately. - Can I help? - Please sit here. Yes. Actually, Miss, I can't let you do this kind of work forever. Mr. Shepherd is looking for a secretary at the moment. Secretary? But I'm too old for that. No, you're perfect. Anyway, he doesn't know much about Japanese culture. Just advise him on Japanese manners. That's all. Can you do it? Yes. Thank you. Where... Where are we? This is not my home. Let me go! Stop it! - No! - It's okay. It's okay. Stop it! Please stop! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! This is for this month. Thank you. That's accurate. It's okay, right? Just a little. Just a little. I can't. I can't. Not here. Later. Later. I can't. Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Wait! What is a classy girl like you doing in this poor neighborhood? I do whatever I want. - I don't like how you stare! - Wait! I'll deal with the bitch myself. You used to be the member of the Red Rose clan, right? You can't refuse the challenge! Fuck! Linda! Linda! Linda! Don't let the bitch beat you! Bitch! Linda! That's right! Bitch! Linda! Come here, you bitch! Bitch! Get up! Linda... You're good. I like you. You completely destroyed that annoying Linda. I feel refreshed. Takako! Drink! This is your welcome party. Don't worry about it. You're one of us now. It's a special cigarette. Your first time? Everything is my first time. Because you're from a different kind of family. So the Red Rose clan has thrown you into the trash. Because Papa died in that scandal. Papa... We never use that word. Nobody here knows the face or name of their father. No Papa. No Mama. Shut up, Teresa! That'd be my mother. She works with me at this club. She's a hostess with a child. No, a pig with a child! What's wrong with being black?! We won't give in to trash like you! I've been hanging around this town even before you were born. If you don't like it, get the fuck out! Because of your shitty attitude, you're getting your ass handed to yourself in Vietnam! How annoying! Shit! Let's drink! Wait! Mama, are you back already? Linda. Sorry. As always. Whatever. I will be out for a while. Okay. Do you have any money? Yes. Mama, is he a new one? Billy already went back to the US. Okay. Enjoy. Takako! Let's go! Sorry that happened on your first visit. No problem. Anyway, are you okay with it? It's nothing. There is nothing else she can do. Linda... I was able to realize the evil nature of the Red Rose clan because I became your friend. There is still nothing much we can do even if you realized it. They are using other people. We have to fight them, Linda! But how? Let's form another clan. There is no other way to fight them. Takako! I will take the leadership. Another clan emerges in the compromised Seiai School. Everyone in the trash class should become members. Are you serious? Since we are friends, I have a strong motivation. Understood. If so, I will support you as much as I can. Who are you? You can't come to this class! Get out! Get out of my sight! What are you doing? Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey! Open up! - Open up! - Listen carefully! We're here to announce the establishment of the Union clan. The Union clan? Everyone! Get into position! Sorry for the shocking news. We are announcing the establishment of the Union clan. Thus, we would like you to give your title to us. As leader of the clan you may call me "Taka the Falcon". You've come all the way to Class A. I am impressed by your bravery. Are you sure you won't cry in the end? You can't touch the Union clan as long as I am with it! Shit! You got a moment? - What do you want? - Just follow us! Let me go! - Just follow us! - Let me go! - You can't run! - Be a good girl! Bitch! - Let me go! - Shut up! - What are you doing? - Quiet! It seems you laid hands on Junko this morning. - I'm here to show our gratitude. - Forgive us! We were bad. They are saying, "Forgive us." What should we do, Junko? - I can't. - She said she can't. Get out. Stop running. - Let me go! What are you doing? - Bitch! Let me go! Come with us. What are you doing? Stop! Hey! My disgrace is the disgrace of the Union clan. Apologize to the Union clan! Say, "Union Clan Forever!" Stand straight without moving! Raise your arms! Say it now! - Union Clan Forever! - Louder! - Union Clan Forever! - Louder! Louder! One more time! Union Clan Forever! - I told you to say it louder! - Union Clan Forever! Let's make them drink something to make them louder. Drink! Drink it! Down the hatch! Open your mouth! Bitch! Retard! The right answer after minus Q is... Union Clan Forever! Forever! Union Clan Forever! Forever! What the fuck? Out of the way! - It's dangerous! - It's dangerous! Out of the way, bitch! Shit! Run! Run! You're too slow, idiot! Idiot! Get her, Leader! This is so cool! One more time! Leader! We are in trouble! We are in trouble! We have to run! Faster! Hey! Hey! Hey! Takako Nonaka. Why did you save me? It was an accident. But it's not that we are not related at all. I am Jiro Ogata. Ogata? I'm the younger brother of Yukiko Ogata who died with your father. Brother and sister? Yes. I wasn't in town when the accident happened. I used to work on the base. But I ran away to Tokyo because I hated it there. I was working as a truck driver. You must hate my father. Your sister died because of him. At first I did. But I've investigated the matter since I came here. It was no accident. It looks like a fake scandal. I think they knew some secrets and that got them killed. Happens all the time. Who? Who was it? Who killed my father? I'll find them! For the sake both of their reputation... I'll take you home. I ran away from home. Ever since the accident, my life has been a mess. I see. You can stay, then. - What? But... - I'll stay in the car. I'm used to it. Don't worry. I'm okay with you staying here. Ridiculous! I'm a man! Let's start! Get ready! I don't want to today. I'm frustrated. What are you talking about? Please try to understand my position as tutor! You always do whatever you want. Get naked! Let's start the lesson you wished for. Thank you very much. Let's start the lesson right away. - Miss! - I'm no Miss. Call me "Queen". My Queen. I'm just a helpless slave. Do with me as you wish! You masochist! More! More! More! More! Today won't end! Thank you! More! More! More! More! What a pathetic tutor! My Queen! My Queen! I'm so happy. You'll listen to whatever I say, right? Whatever my Queen desires! Good. Then you'll help me kicking out the trash class. Yes. But your father, the president of the PTA, won't allow it. My father? To improve the quality of education at Seiai School, the teachers should be more internationally trained. I've discussed this with Mr. Shepherd. We are going to make good teachers study in the US. Wow, incredible! That's great. Hey, is the lesson over already? Your daughter's abilities are improving daily. You've done a good job. Your daughter must be so happy. All the great teachers of the school are tutoring her. - Father, I have a favor to ask. - What is it? I want you to kick o ut the trash class. I can't be in the same school with them. Kinue! Why that, all of a sudden? It's not that I don't understand your feelings, but that's how grown-up society works. But because of them, Seiai School can't be a prestigious school. That's right. But we are giving equal opportunities to them. - Isn't that right, Dean? - Yes, that's correct. Kinue! Democracy is sometimes annoying! One side enjoys the low tuition, the other side enjoys the best quality education. That's the reason why I donate a lot to the school. Understood? - Understood? - No, I don't understand. Kinue! It's hard to raise a kid, isn't it? No. You should behave like a gentleman. Let's get to the next stage, Miss. If you do me a favor, I will let you kiss me. Seriously? Get off me, you idiot! Let me go! I have something to talk to Mr. Shepherd about! I want to say something to that lying bastard! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! I didn't know you were interested in that kind of awful woman. I didn't know you were interested in that kind of awful woman. Forget about it. She's just a crazy girl. She can't even compare to you. You are flattering me. Let's keep talking about it. Nick and Bob? I think they can keep secrets since they used to be soldiers. What are you doing? Let me go! Let me go! What are you doing? Let me go! Let me go! What are you doing? Let me go! Let me go! Is it you, Linda? What happened, Linda? Linda! You... Linda! Linda! You have to be strong now! Every girl in this town has these painful memories. You see? Linda! Linda! Linda! Linda! Linda! It's wrong! It's just wrong! Why should an innocent girl like Linda have to suffer like this? It must've been hard for you, Linda... Your mother being raped by an American soldier and your own birth from it. It must've been painful for you. Even if you acted like nothing bothered you, you must've been suffering in your heart. That's why you didn't wan to live the same life as me. You've never done anything only for yourself. You wanted to avenge your mother. I already told you several times. There is nothing much to do since it was self-defense. It's not self-defense if you slaughter a girl like that. Answer me then, what are you going to do about Linda's rape? You have nothing to say even if we are suffering like this? - Aren't ashamed of yourself as a teacher? - Are you even a human being? - What are you going to do? - Be quiet! We've been waiting for you, President! I've dealt with the newspapers and the police. Thank you for that. Also, Mr. Shepherd won't make a big fuss about this incident. Thank you very much. It was the student's fault. Nick and Bob said that they didn't rape her. That must be right. Also, a trifle like this shouldn't harm the friendship between the US and Japan. Come again? A trifle? Somebody died! If you think that way, we have a good idea too. 27th Ceremony of Establishment of the School According to a request made by Yusaku Hayami... 27th Ceremony of Establishment of the School 27th Ceremony of Establishment of the School the president of the PTA, and G. H. Shepherd, the education advisor... the president of the PTA, and G. H. Shepherd, the education advisor... the Hayami Shepherd Education Fund has been established. For that, we, the teachers, and the students show gratitude to them with a big applause. Let me open the 27th ceremony by singing the song of the school. Everyone, stand up! What is that? Stop it right now! Stop! - What is this? - Stop! Please stop! What kind of stupidity is this? Stop it! I told you to stop! Get out! All of you! Sexual Singing for Sexual Lo ve School Get out! You fucking bitches! Dean, calm them down now! Yes! Yes! Mother! Takako! Takako! Forgive me. - Mother! - There is no other way, Takako. Mother, I'm an adult now. I understand your feelings. Stop it. Nobody understands my feelings. Not even you can understand. Leader, where have you been? Welcome. I knew you'd be here. I've been looking for you. You have grown up. - This is marijuana. - Give it back! Get your shit together! Your father was killed because of this. Tell me. Who killed my father? Who was it? While I was organizing what my sister left behind, I found this note. She was Yusaku Hayami's secretary. You can see what he did from this. Hayami got my sister pregnant. But what did my father do? Hayami and Shepherd were dealing drugs. Your father figured it out and started an investigation. But they were faster. That's why they set up the accident. So that's it. The deceased was blamed for everything. That's evil. They are like hyenas. Not only did they manufacture weapons for the war... they also established companies to bring in and distribute a lot of drugs in Japan. They are like angels of death. But we can't let them do that. I will reveal their true nature to the public. I smuggled this out of the base. I will use this when the time comes. I will tear them down with this. I can even do it alone. The two of us. The two of us together! Jiro! Jiro! No, I don't want money. Let's go! This way. Let's do a little S&M here. Now undress if you know what I mean. I have to tie you up. Your feet too. I'm tying up your feet real tight. Later, I'm going to hit you with a whip. Do you like it? This will do. Confess. You raped Linda, didn't you? - Somebody ordered us to do that. - Who was it? Kinue, right? Kinue Hayami asked you to do it, right? Leader! It was Kinue as expected. - What are you going to do, Leader? - We have to finish this. Listen! I, Taka the Falcon, will take care of all of you! Mr. Hayami, the goods from Vietnam were delivered today. Please deliver the next load as soon as possible. The amount of drugs coming into Japan is just too small. Of course, this is partially because of the tight border control. However, the police can't touch American soldiers bringing them in. The nationally popular enka singer born in this very area, Miya Saionji! I never expected that you, one of Kinue's classmates, would come back as a great singer. I am honored. You have a good stage presence and a flawless body. Please... How about signing an exclusive contract with us? I could even consider you as my main singer. Thank you very much. Let's discuss the matter over a meal later. Okay? Who are you? Ogata... Ogata? You remember my name. That's right. I'm the younger brother of your secretary, Yukiko Ogata, who you betrayed and killed. - So what? - Stop playing innocent! Rumors about your activities are starting to spread. And I just found the evidence. You punk! You play dirty, Hayami! You even smeared Nonaka's name! I won't let you do that anymore! Shepherd! A t 3 PM today, come to the closed factory in Karashima to conclude our battle. Understood. Tell Takako I've accepted the challenge. Alright. What are you going to do? Move over! Hello. What? Junko? The Red Rose clan won't get involved with low lives like you. If you want to save Junko's life, bring a document stating the dismissal of the Union clan. A one-on-one battle should follow. Shit! They are using dirty tricks. Leader! What are you going to do? We can't give up Junko's life. Long time no see, Takako! Miya! How are you, Miya? It only took a short time until I left the zoo in Hokkaido. Now I am newbie singer Saionji. By the way, Takako. Do you know a Jiro Ogata? Jiro? Did anything happen to him? He was shot and kept asking for you. Go to the hospital right away. Jiro? Shot?! Jiro! - Do you know him? - Yes... Since he is still bleeding, we have to give him a transfusion. Doctor, use my blood please! What is your blood type? - The patient's is B. - Mine is O. Doctor, use my blood for the transfusion! What happened? Leader! Leader! I am going to take care of her! - You don't mind, right? - What? I heard everything. I expected you'd be better than this. If you are really the leader of the Red Rose clan, you should compete with the Union clan in a fair manner. As a former leader, I, Miya the Spade, will organize it for you. Jiro! Takako! I'm pathetic... I finally found the evidence in Hayami's storage. Shit! Jiro! You shouldn't move. What's up? Jiro! I have to go somewhere now! I won't be long. Wait for me. Ms. Nonaka! What are you doing here? You should take a rest after a blood donation. Ms. Nonaka! Ms. Nonaka! - What happened to Takako? - Is she hiding somewhere? You'd better worry about yourselves! Make way! Make way! Keiko! The battle has just started! Here I come! You bitch! Leader! Leader! You bitch! Come here! Wait! Wait! Die! Die! Die! - Get up! - Get up! It's not over for you. Mr. President? This is Miya Saionji. I want to meet you tonight. It's unbelievable. I never thought you'd invite me. Actually, you've forgotten about me, right? No way. I haven't. - Mr. President? - What is it? - Could you do me a favor? - What is it? I hate being watched in bed. Would you sleep with me if I'm wearing this? That's very impressive. You make me fall for you even more. We have enough time. Why don't you have a shower first? Kinue! Sexual Punishment Who are you? We got a report about a suicide in this room. Stop it! Mr. Hayami! What's this? Mr. Hayami, what's going on here? Isn't that your daughter next to you? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Operating Room Doctor! Is Jiro okay? He will survive, right? I can donate more blood if necessary... Jiro... His condition worsened suddenly. We tried our best. The time of death was 22:11. We're done. Who is it? Stop it! Turn off the lights! The End
