I'm letting you go. Just don't let me find you snooping in here again. Now, you be a good girl and let yourself out before I change my mind. Ahh! Blah. Blah. Zoom. Zoom. It was a big one. A big, fat, ugly one, and I killed it. Hey, okay. Hey, you want to play? Hey. Hey, Cory, what's wrong, buddy? I want to go home. Oh, Cory, you are home. No, with my mommy. That's all right, buddy. Your mommy will be here soon, and I'll take care of both of you. Hey, hey. Take it easy. Look. It'll be all right. Okay. We're a family now. Look, you said you wanted a daddy, huh? Here I am. You're not my daddy. Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I am your daddy. And you're going to listen to me. You stop it... I'm not going to raise no cry baby. I mean it. If you don't stop crying, I'll really give you something to cry about. Hey, put me down. I want to go home. You just be quiet. I want to see my mommy. Hey, let me out. Let me out. Quiet. Cory. Sally. [Telephone rings] Hello. Michelle. Hi, it's Joe. I just got back. I got your message. Joe, I need you to check something out for me. Sure. What is it? The suicide next door. Can you confirm who died? What's this all about? Just do this, please. Okay. Just give me a sec. What was his name again? Culley. Robert culley... C-u-l-l-e-y. Okay. I found him. How old was he? It says here 31, so... Bobby was about 31. No, he was born in '31. So that would make him, what, 68? Oh, my god. He's alive. What did you say? Bobby culley junior... He was the man who was stalking me. I thought he was dead, so I didn't tell you. What are you talking about? He was the peeping Tom? Yes. And I think he killed someone. Killed someone? I'll tell you about it when you get here. Just hurry, please. All right. I'm on my way. Don't do anything until I get there. I won't. Let me out. I want to see my mommy. Let me out. [Banging noises] [Dramatic music] Hey. If you don't stop, you'll never see her again. You understand? [Door squeaks] Cory. Ahh! Oh, god. Oh. Welcome home. You. You killed him. Who? Charles? He was a real loser. I couldn't let him come between US. Where's my son? I swear to god if you laid a finger on him, I'll kill you. Our son is just fine. He's playing with his new toys. In fact, we were waiting for you to come home. Listen, Bobby or b.J. Or whoever the hell you are, I want my son, and I want him now. Tough day at the office, sweetheart? You should be well rested after last night. I put a little something in your tea to help you relax, since this is such a special day for US. You are so adorable when you sleep. You know, your skin, so soft. Oh, don't worry, my Princess. I wouldn't dream of consummating the relationship before our marriage. Just tell me where my son is, or I'll shoot. Remember that guy in highland town? You couldn't shoot him. Why would you shoot me? I'm warning you. Where's Cory? Cory. Oh, he's just... That's better. You do what you want to me, but let Cory go. Come on. Get up. Don't. So you found my little secret. You're clever, aren't you. Well, you better be careful though. Oh! Ahh! Two old friends reunited. [Till the end of time playing on music box] Incredible, isn't it? I know what you're thinking. You wish you'd shot me, don't you? You're right. [Gun clicks repeatedly] Oops. No bullets. I took them out. I'm wicked. I know. I love you so much. You're my Princess. You shouldn't be alone. I'm going to save you from this life so that we can be together forever. Just let... Let Cory go, please. Well, why would I let our son go? Every day I've been looking at you, looking at the way you get out of bed in the morning, and the way you brush your hair, the way you get dressed. I called just to hear the sound of your voice, the way you take a breath. My father watched you too. He said I couldn't have you, but I showed him. I will Cherish and protect you, and make you so happy. I promise, my sweet. It's all right. I understand. I have a surprise for you. I'm going to draw you a bath. Then I'll bring you to our bed so that we can celebrate our wedding night. You are so beautiful. (B.j.) I'll be out soon, Michelle, my love. Mommy. Mommy. B.J. Locked me in the basement. Cory, honey, listen to me. I want you to get out of this house. I want you to run to the neighbors and call the police. Do you understand? Yes. I know a secret way out. Okay. Then go. Go! What the... Hey, come back here. (Michelle) Run, Cory. Run! Come here. [Sirens wailing] [Banging at door] (Carvelli) Michelle? Hello. Michelle. (Cory) No. Mommy, look out. Come here. Why are you doing this? You are going to destroy everything. We are a family now. Don't you understand? A family. Bobby, how could we be a family? Everyone around here knows US. Who's going to believe that? We'll move far away. We'll get married, and we'll start all over again. Look, there's nothing to stop US now. It'll be wonderful, Michelle. I promise. A wife is supposed to be able to trust her husband, Bobby. How can I trust you? Of course you can. I love you. What do you do to the people you love? What you did to your father? My father? He didn't want me to be with you. He wanted you for himself. No. Just like my mother. He didn't want me to be with her either. He was always trying to keep US apart. She was dying. He didn't even want me to see her in the hospital. I never saw her again. I hated him. Like you hated Ann? What? Ann? How? No. I loved her. You killed her. She betrayed me. No. No, Bobby. She didn't love you. That's why you pretended to be Everett. You raped her. You killed her. No, no, no, no. You don't understand. I was her knight. I was trying to save her, and she wouldn't listen. That's the way you save someone, huh? You kill them. Lies. That's a lie. That's a lie. They deserved it. They deserved it. Hey, buddy. Why'd you do that? Isn't that what you did to Ann? You threw her down the stairs. (B.j.) What? She didn't love me. Mommy. Mommy. He hurt Joe. Joe? Stay here, Cory. Joe. Joe. Oh, Joe. Don't move. I'll call an ambulance. Stop. Please. (Michelle) Cory, go upstairs. B.j.'s hurting. Go! Give me your hand. [Gunshots] [Sighs] (Cory) Mom. Hmm? Is Sally in heaven with the angels? I'm sure she is, honey. I think Sally would have appreciated what you've done. Yeah, but she probably would have rearranged everything. Hi. I'm glad you could make it. I'm very glad to be here, believe me. I have something that belongs to you. Thank you for everything. Mommy. Mommy. Oh, excuse me. What? Look what Joe gave me. Three hockey tickets. (Michelle) Three hockey tickets? There's one for you too. You're going to come, right? You bet I am. Hey, you know how much I love you? How much? Oh, maybe this much. No. This much. Captioning provided by lifetime television.
