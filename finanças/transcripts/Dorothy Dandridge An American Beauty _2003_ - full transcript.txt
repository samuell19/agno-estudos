(MultiCom Jingle) (orchestral music) - [Narrator] Dorothy Dandridge and her music are inextricably linked. She sang and danced for her supper her whole life. In her teens, she often appeared in the 1940s phenomenon called soundies. Here is Dorothy dancing as the world-famous Mills Brothers long for a paper doll to call their own. * I'm gonna buy a paper doll * That I can call my own * A doll that other fellows cannot steal * And then the flirty, flirty guys * With their flirty, flirty eyes * Will have to flirt with dollies * That are real * When I come home at night * She will be waiting * She'll be the truest doll in all this world * I'd rather have a paper doll to call my own * Than have a fickle-minded real live girl * I guess you've played the doll game o'er and o'er * I guess you've had a million dolls or more * You just quarreled with Sue * That's why you're blue * She's gone away and left you * Just like all dolls do * I guess you know it's tough to be alone * And it's tough to love a doll that's not your own * I'm through with all of them * I'll never fall again * Say boy * Whatcha gonna do * I'm going to buy a paper doll * That I can call my own * A doll that other fellows cannot steal * And then the flirty, flirty guys * With their flirty, flirty eyes * Will have to flirt with dollies that are real * When I come home at night she will be waiting * She'll be the truest doll in all this world * I'd rather have a paper doll to call my own * Than have a fickle-minded real live girl (piano music) - [Narrator] Filmed for reverse projection through mirrors and nickelodeon-style jukeboxes, the soundies all had their titles projected backward., Sam Coslow was the executive producer of most of the soundies, including this one with Hoagy Carmichael. Here's a look at a very young Dorothy acting out the lyrics to Lazybones. * Mm hmm * Be my holidays * Lazybones, sleepin' in the sun * How you 'spect to get your day's work done * Ah you never your day's work done * Sleepin' in the noon-day sun * Lazybones * Sleepin' in the shade * Now tell me * How you 'spect to get your cornmeal made * You never get your cornmeal made * Sleepin' in the evening shade * Now when you taters needs sprayin' * I bet you keep prayin' * That the bugs fall off of the vine * And when you go fishin' * I bet you keep wishin' * That the fish won't grab at your line * You're such a lazybones * Sleepin' all the day * Tell me * How you 'spect to make a dime that way * You'll never make a dime that way * Well looky here * He never heard a word I said * Lazybones * Sleepin' all the day * How you 'spect to make a dime that way * Oh you'll never make a dime that way * Well looky here * He never heard a word I said * Sleepin' all the day * You a good-for-nothin' lazybones - [Narrator] Listen closely to the lyrics of Swing for My Supper. Dorothy sings that her parents made her rock and roll and put it on red hot. Years later, in the rock era, many DJs and promoters would claim ownership of that phrase, rock and roll. * Mommy and my poppy are the cutest things to me * If it hadn't been for Mom and Pa * I don't know where I'd be * Every night I thank my stars * That I was born that year * I know that you'll agree with me * When I tell what they did * They made me swing for my supper * When I was a tot * They made me rock and roll * And put it on red hot * Each night at the table * Here's what Papa said * Kid if you wallop me hi-dee-hi * Sling me a slice of bread * Treatin' 'em right my mama said * Won't help to make you click * So they taught me, brought me up on good ole 'rithmetic * Yeah * Right now I'm flyin' high * I'm gonna reach my goal * Swingin' for my supper * They put rhythm in my soul * I was givin' the hi-dee-hi * When I first made a sound * Soon as I could walk * They made me kick the darn around * Yeah * Someday another name is added to our own * Let's swing him for our supper * Let the rhythm in his soul - [Narrator] Ella May Morris, a white singer who often hit the black charts,*# was the first to make Cow Cow Boogie famous. The song, complete with slightly risque lyrics, was also performed in Harlem Rides the Range, starring Herb Jeffries. * Out on the plains down near Santa Fe * I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day * And as he jogged along * I heard him singin' * The most peculiar cowboy song * It was a ditty * He learned in the city * Come-a tie yay * Come-a tie yippity yie yay * Get along * Get hip little doggies, get along * You'd better be on your way * Get along * Get hip little doggies * And he trucked it on down * The old fairway * Singin' his Cow Cow Boogie * In the strangest way * Come-a tie yay * Come-a tie yippity yie yay * Singin' his cowboy songs * He's just too much * He's got a knocked-out Western accent * With a Harlem touch * He was raised * On loco weed * He's what you call * A swing half-breed * Singin' his Cow Cow Boogie * In the strangest way * Come-a tie yay * Come-a tie yippity yie yay (gunshots booming) - Yippie!
