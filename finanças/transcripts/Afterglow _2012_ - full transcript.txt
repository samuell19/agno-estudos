CHAPTER ONE THAT DAY, THE TWO OF US A little whiskey, a little water, a little soda and lots of ice, brother. Okay, sir. I'm so sorry, I didn't even notice you. You are sitting right here and... Excuse me! Change that order to two martinis. Shaken not stirred. Are you Bond? James Bond? I... I can be whoever you want me to be... I mean, I can be Elvis Presley if you want... If you want, I can be RD Burman... Anything you want... Are you usually like this? Or have you had a little too much? How can I judge that myself? Why? Did I offend you? No. Not yet. In fact, you might be the most entertaining thing at this party. Lovely. Thank you. It's usually like this at these parties. Just some drunks and some pimps. Which one are you? I still belong to the first category. Are you a Bengali all the way? No... You are half a Bengali, right? Second category. You don't look like someone who attends these parties regurlarly. True. Rina insisted... So, I'm here. I knew it... I knew it. Oh, this ruthless society! This cruel world! Torturing a beautiful, helpless girl... The tragedy... Is this your impression of Manoj Kumar? Your martini, sir. Thank you. Shaken not stirred. Of course. Hey, why are you hiding out here? - Come to the dance floor. - Let's go. Everybody is looking for you, buddy. - Come, let's go. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Come, come, come. Come on. Here we go All over again You and me Us again That old breeze Blowing again Tears go back Smiles again Hey you... Sitting at the bar Like a vision to me A thousand dreams were born In a moment so free Every breath I need you Every beat I feel you Every time I miss you I die - Sound! - Rolling! - Camera! - Rolling! Action! In the land of King Hirak, flour and sugar come together There's diamond in every bite. Diamond Biscuits! Cut it! Cut it! The shot was going great. Why did you put your foot down? We're going to freeze frame on that. Here on this golden... Lift your leg again... You have to keep it right here, okay? The logo will appear right here. - Oh! - Got it? So, until I say cut, don't put your feet down. - Okay. - Don't let the leg drop! Let's go again. Ready? - Sound! - Rolling! - Camera! - Rolling! Action! In the land of King Hirak, flour and sugar come together... Now, tell me what is the matter? Which matter? This matter... The way you seem to be everywhere I go. I can say the same thing about you. You could have but you didn't. But I said it. What do you have to say about that? Actually... Actually, this is our fourth life together. What do you mean? It means... ...we have seven lives together. Three gone. Three to go. - This is the fourth life. - What rubbish! - I was told. - What? You won't believe me. Who told you? How will I know? It was a call from a private number. - Private number? - Yes. - Phone? - Yes. Have you been drinking since morning? What the... If the phone call is made to me, what can I do about it? Next time I will give your number. - What's your number? - Terrible! Terrible way to get a girl's number. Just see! I am running so late because of your silly joke. What are you late for? I have an exam today at school! Sorry... You are still in school? Even I didn't fail so many times. It's an exam to become a teacher. At St. James' school. Oh okay. That's good. So, please let me go. You might be jobless but others have to work. I have work too. My work... What have I done? I have to go now... I will, for sure, catch you later, Ms. St. James'. I shall see you later. Bye! What happened? What happened? Pulled hamstring, sore groin, sprained calf muscle... A lot has happened. What? He was fine a little while ago. What happened suddenly? You didn't say cut. And he kept standing with his feet up. And now he is frozen in frame. Anyway. We will take it from the last shot. Listen, do I look like a school's principal? - You? - Yeah, see. Principal? You don't even look like you've been to school. "The rose is a rose, And was always a rose. "But the theory now goes That the apple's a rose, "And the pear is, and so's The plum, I suppose. "The dear only knows What will next prove a rose. "You, of course, are a rose - But were always a rose." In this poem, the poet, Robert Frost is trying to make us understand... ...that there is no one meaning of beauty. That it changes with time and place... That you will all discover your own rose... Your own unique meaning of beauty... Miss, this is for you. - Thank you. - But I'm not giving it to you. - Then who? - I don't know. Who gave this to you? This is a secret. Thank you! This is for me, right? And you can't tell me who sent it. Hey, wait! Come here... Did she send this for me? Did she send it back? What did I tell you? I gave you two chocolates to give her the rose and run. Here I give The name of this road Colourful Road Your warmth The impression of your feet My map Your sunshine Your raindrops A short cut to Gariahat Your sudden queitness Your unfailing beauty Build a home Let the stranger be known Don't know whether in your land Where the obscure waterfalls flow Close to dawn Which incessant friend of yours Build a home Let the stranger be known I look for you in the small lanes I hide if I feel This hide and seek brings us closer The sun sends rays Dusk shows shadowy avenues I walk around you Don't know what lies unsaid beneath your calm exterior The day comes to an end Darkness is a friend Build a home Let the stranger be known Turn around But no one's there A lonely tram A blue denim But the eyelids don't drop Build a home Let the stranger be known What do you want now? One evening. Granted. - What? - What? Don't want it? No, no. Of course, I want it. When did I say I will take that? Saturday. 9 o'clock. Flambé? Thank you. Thank you. Did you agree to have dinner with me because of what happened at school? - Should I tell you? - Please, tell me. - Right now? - Please. He called me. Who? Private number call. Three gone... Three to go... This is the fourth one. - What will you have? - Eclairs. - Eclairs pastry, ma'am? - No. Pepper devilled crabs. Okay, ma'am. Two? Can you eat spicy food? What do you think I have been getting for so long? Two, please. Are you a regular here? I come here once in a while. With whom? Friends. Friends? Yes, it's plural. No one special? Friend? What will you do if there is? I'll feel sad...for that friend. Why? Because...he'll have to forget you. And it won't be easy to forget you. But how will I know all this? I'm not going to forget you very easily. I mean... Can't forget you! Won't forget you! Can't forget you... Won't forget you... Do I look like someone who can forget one person for another? No, what I meant was... ...for the right person... You are wrong. I don't have a friend like that. At least, not until now. CHAPTER TWO OH FOREIGNER Because the song doesn't belong to you alone. The song is ours. We created it together. You might have written it... You might have composed it... But I am the inspiration... I'm the muse. And I haven't allowed you... ...to sell me out in the markets, in CDs and radios... That's my girl! To make me a earworm... Now, show me the stills. Name? Ranjabati Sen. Ranjabati... Wow! What has she done before? Nothing much. She got kicked out in the second round of a reality show. - Is she from Kolkata? - No, Jamshedpur. Oh! Fantastic! Very good. 20. Age. Suri, even after all this time, you don't know what "20" stands for? She must be, at least, 23 or 24. Then... What I was trying to say is, our requirement is 30... Oh, that won't matter. Middle aged actors are playing college students all the time... A difference of five - six years won't matter. It's okay. What should I do about tomorrow's audition? Cancel it and get in touch with her. And draw up her contract. And let our producer know that we have found our lead. That is my Charu. Arindam Roy Chowdhury? Hey, wait. - Arindam Roy Chowdhury? - She just barged in... - Sir is busy. Please, come with me. - Are you busy? I am Ranja... Ranjabati Sen. I am acting in your next film. Oh, really? You don't even know. I auditioned two weeks back. Last week, I got a call from your people saying I'm in. Great! Congratulations! But there's a problem. What? I got the contract yesterday. It says I can't do any other film until this one releases. Is this fair? So, how many films are you working on now? No, I'm not doing any films right now. But talks are on. What if something works out? "What if something works out"... So, how big is your role in my film? They'd said it's important during the audition. But everyone says that. They'll say it's important even if it's the role of a janitor. Will you play a janitor? I'll never do it. Well, can't you find out? I mean, you are the director after all. How will that help you? Don't do these small supporting roles. You wait for your turn. You are heroine material. You think so? But no one has ever cast me before. Everybody tells me, "You are too good to be a sister or a friend... "...and too new to be a herione." Once you play a sister or a friend... ...you won't remain a new comer or become a heroine. I know. I should just quit. But you must have a job to quit from. You quit after your debut in my film. Okay? Okay. Then, there is no other problem with the contract. - No. - Okay. Then I'll see you next Wednesday. Where? At the shoot! It starts next Wednesday. Lucky Wednesday! You'll get the schedule. See you. And listen... Don't be late. We can start the shoot without the janitor. But we can't start without the lead actor. - Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! - It's okay! It's okay! Thank you! You know, I had a feeling... I mean I had a weird feeling... - Thank you... - It's okay... How can the boatman's reflection turn to a dream Where the trust is completely broken Hello. Where does my heart fly away? Day and night All around the year Why do you remain sad? Why are you scared of your own self? Breath escapes me Sleep eludes me Whole night confined in the eyes There is no wound But why does it hurt? In the land of illusions How can dreams stay alive? Great emptiness lies in every direction Where does my heart fly away? You? There's no need for that, Charu. You can't bring a dead man back to life. Then why did you bring me back to life? Why did you appear on my telescope? Why did you thread the needle? I didn't want to stay alive, Om... I didn't. Cut it! Cut it! It's looking a little rehearsed. You take your time. Don't think about the next dialogues when you are saying these lines. Feel it. Okay? Can you do it? You okay there? Let's go again! Clap in! - Sound! - Rolling! - Camera! - Rolling! 27 by 1! Take 2! Action! There's no need for that anymore, Charu. You can't bring a dead man back to life. I didn't want to live. I was okay the way I was. Why did you thread my nee...needle? Why did you appear on my telescope? I didn't want to live, Om... I didn't. Cut it! Cut it! What is happening? Where is the pain? If you don't feel it, how will the audience feel it? He has broken your trust. He has let you down. All the sadness, anger, resentment... Give it back to him in these few lines! Okay? You can do it! Come on! Let's take it from the top! I didn't want to live, Om. I didn't want to live. I didn't want to live, Om. I didn't want to live. I didn't want to live, Om. I didn't want to live. Cut it! Cut it! Yes, cut it! Cut it! Cut it! Are you happy with the Black Swan make up? You think like Béla Tarr but you make films like you are in Beniapukur! What is it? What's wrong with you? What happened? You could do it in the audition. You did it in the rehearsals. Why can't you perform here? Everyone told me not to cast a new girl. But I rooted for you... I put everything at stake. What's wrong with you? Tell me! Boss, let's call for lunch break. Lunch! I'm not doing your film anymore. I will take care of the losses you incurred because you cast me. I won't be able to do it at one go... But I will pay you back eventually... Please... Please, don't drag this to court. And where will I find a lead actor now? I've read in the newspaper. Everyone wants to work with you. I'm sure you'll find someone. Someone with experience. Someone who will "feel" like you. Someone who you won't need to shout at in front of everyone. Then what will happen to your dreams of becoming a heroine? If you quit my film, no one else will cast you. Not even for a janitor's role. Please sit. You are still under contract, remember? Sit! Close your eyes. Shut your eyes. With your eyes shut, try to think... ...of that day... ...the day, let's say... ...some boyfriend of yours, left you. And you had thought... ...that's it... It's all over... Shut your eyes and try to think... How hurt you felt. The way you had felt like slapping him. The way you felt like killing him. What happened? Have you never experienced anything like this? No one has ever left you? Fine. Then think of the day you first fell in love. The first time you fell in love? Come on. The day you fell in love... You were a little scared... What if my love remains unfulfilled? What happened? Even this hasn't happened? Oh damn! What will happen now? Who am I trying to make the film with? Can I imagine? Oh, you can do that? Do it. Please begin. What? Your background commentary. Oh! Try to relive every moment of your life in flashback... So many people have come and gone... But... No one stayed back... Then he came in to your life... The one... The one for you... You fell in love... You gave him everything... But he doesn't understand your love... You're feeling this deep void, this hurt... That's enough. See, you got it. There was something missing in the sunlight It felt incomplete Now touched by his colour In the darkness Where stars were like fireflies Now touched by his colour The grass sparkles brightly Happiness stares shyly It has decorated my imagination Decorating life as it goes along As the dust settles On the floors of the cinema I finally catch up with them Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy... Crazy, crazy I am crazy for you... Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy... Crazy, crazy I am crazy for you... Wow! Beautiful rain! What was the need to build sets? We could've shot a rain sequence. What? Again? Don't you read what's written on the pack? "Injurious to health". Do I have to teach you to read? Put it back. Okay. Will anybody bring an umbrella? Here it is. I don't need it. Hold it for her. Otherwise, you'll regret it when she becomes a star. "Why didn't I hold the umbrella for her?" What's the point of holding an umbrella for a good-for-nothing director? Do you have a car? Okay. Do you have your call time for tomorrow? Yes. Go on... Take her... Come on! Ask them to wait... Come with me. My car's rained off... - Oh no! You're getting wet. - Yeah... - Come in, quickly. - I guess I have to. - What is your name? - Kanhaiya. - Kanhaiya? - Yes. Listen, you take the production bus home... Okay? I will take this car and bring it back tomorrow. I have to let my boss know. You tell your boss it's me. Go on. It'll be my fault if you catch a cold. What? Are you going to make your director your driver now? - Come, sit in the front. - Yes, coming. Can I ask you something? If you don't ask if I say no, then no. No... Okay. Please ask your next question for 25 lakh rupees. Ask... Why did you cast me? Oh, to save money. What? Stars are very expensive. That's why. Rubbish! Really? Then, what is the correct answer? You... You liked me... - We... - I mean...you thought I was good looking. We are crossing Jadavpur. No? We are really crossing Jadavpur. Oh no! What's going to happen now? What is going to happen? Which lane? The driver knew. What? You don't know where you live? Why are you scolding me? It's been just two months since I moved here. Then call someone. Aunty must have fallen asleep by now. What will happen? It's not this lane... Now what? It's not this one either... Take the left. This left turn? Now? Now... Now, take the right turn. Now, left. What's happening here? Left, right, left, right. - Right. - Again? Now, left. Girl, the game is over and you're lost. We are lost. You are still looking beautiful... Ranja, wake up. Wake up, Ranja. Wake up. We have to look for your house. Get up. Get up. Get up! We have to be at the shoot in a few hours. Get up. I know that, Mr. Director. Then, get up now. After I drop you home, I have to catch some proper sleep. Was this improper? Don't act like a kid. Call on that aunty's phone. Get the directions... I'll drop you home... That one. What "That one"? My home. Get out of the car. What happened? What the... Get off the car. Why are you getting mad at me? I am waiting, Ranja. Why are you so angry? - Get out. - What are you doing? What is this? Got it? You are getting up from there... Coming to your mark and saying your lines... While she is sitting... Let's go. - Let's go for a take. - Aren't we going to rehearse once? No need. We will go for take. Come on. Rehearsals and I... What is she talking about? Rehearsals are dead. I was telling you remember what Alejandro was telling me at Berlin... This entire thing about being spontaneous... Even I don't know what I am going to do... What is happening? Yeah, I know... I know... Let's start... Give it to me. Send Rajat to his first mark. - Postions. - Go take your mark. Pan a little to the right. That's it. Fine. - Sound! - Rolling! Seven by one. Take one! - Camera! - Rolling! Action! Charu... I've come to look for my Charu. When you have come to look for her... You must be punished for it too... Aren't you going to say cut? Cut it! You are going to take another one, right? Set up the next shot. Which one? Rajat's OS. Change the lens. This wasn't good. Sound...check. What happened? Why are you doing this? You were the one... That day when you had asked me to imagine... It was you I saw... I saw you... You love me too... I know you love me. What happened? Why are you quiet? Say something... Everything was fine yesterday. - What's wrong with you, suddenly? - Ranja! I am married. CHAPTER THREE MY PATH Music from the flutes filled the surroundings Yamuna's wish The waves crashed on the railings... Under the kadamba tree With neon's trick Light would pass through bodies... With gills in the hair Laughing uninterrupted With gills in the hair At the end of the day My lover would bound me My heart flies away to Mathura My friends were a flock of birds The grasslands Bells adorned my red painted feet At the signal from the steamer Moonlight floats away The lamps have not been lit Rai is not going to get caught These ups and downs Rai is not going to get caught Only her ringtone now cries Losing Shyam in her kohl My heart flies away to Mathura Darling... Come home Come, come, come... - Hello. - Hello, yeah. Tell me. Will you have dinner at home? Yes. You eat and go to sleep. I will take it myself. Okay. Bye. How come you are up so early? I have to go on a recce. Shoot starts next week, right? Did I tell you? No. Read it in the newspaper. Oh, is the article out? Did you find the heroine of your dreams? Yes, managed to find someone. Complete amateur. She had come to the office yesterday. Need to work on her... That's something you are good it. Thank you. What's up with you? Exams. Tests and more tests. - Saturday is the Maitra wedding? - Whose? The family upstairs. It's their daughter's wedding. They have insisted on us being there. I can't make it. There is a party at Mehta's this Saturday. You go. How will I go alone? Then make some excuse. They'll all leave from here. What will I say when they ring the doorbell? Then come with me to the Mehta's party. They invite you every time. That's exactly what I've always told you. Arindam, we don't invest in your movies. We invest in you. I make steel rods. What do I know about films? Let's not kid ourselves here, okay. You can take all my money and make me an idiot... ...or make "3 Idiots". Aren't you Mrs. Roy Chowdhury? How have you been? I'm meeting you after ages. It seems you've forgotten about us. We are not so evil that you won't even meet us. - No, it's not like that. - I'm sure it's Arindam's doing. Wait, I'll settle some scores with him. Arindam! Hey, Arindam! - I'll just be back. - Yeah. What happened, Kalyan? She might be your wife. But she's like a sister to us. It's not fair that you keep her in hiding. When did we meet last? Must have been a decade ago. This is not good, Mr. Director. She looks so pale. It's okay if you don't want her to meet us. But you have to take care of your one and only wife. Arindam has to take care of the heroines. Madam, your drink? Please, get madam a drink, quickly. I'm fine, really. "Looking pale"... You could've put a smile on your face today. What else can I do to take care of you? And why do you have to wear this red saree? You look old in it. When have I ever tried to hide you? I know... You don't like these parties. That's why I never force you. All these low lives... rascals... Always looking for gossip. You know how this industry works. Today, they are saying it here. Tomorrow, they'll be discussing this on the floor. I am the director. Damn it! - Hey. - Hmmm? You should make a film now. Film? Yes. Film. Cinema. I know what it means. Darling... You had worked with Hrishi-Da in two films. I think you'll make a great film. Really? Do you know what I think, Mrs. Roy Chowdhury? Your love for me has made you blind. I see you. What do you see, Ishi? That you can last longer than 30 seconds. Oh, really? You have written many limmericks... It's time to start writing poems. That will be for posterity... You mean... It'll still be here even when I am gone? Something like that? Slipped into melodrama again... Melodrama? Who is the melodrama queen? You want me to show you some melodrama? I give up... My heroine! Come, let's go back to the room. Let's go...let's go... Naman? Look at your own copy-book please. Miss, may I be excused please? Projeet, you've been excused thrice in the last one hour. I know, miss. Please... Projeet, if you haven't studied being excused isn't going to help, no? Okay. Don't look at each other's copies. And Projeet, you can go. Madam, we are here to meet Arindam. From where? Kolkata TV. He was informed about it. He knows about it. Okay. Please come in. What is it? Your guests are here. Coming. Where should we shoot? They, actually, have exams... Can you please keep it quiet? Okay. Okay. - Can I offer you some water or tea? - No, we are fine. What's the matter? - Right here. - Arindam! We are from Kolkata TV. Did I confirm the shoot for today? Yes, I mean... Today is Saturday. Okay. Please sit. Do it here only. There's a class going on here. Why don't you dismiss the class a little early today. Their exams start day after tomorrow. They are taking a test. You are setting the question paper, right? Give them a few questions ahead. Let's begin. Okay, brother... Please wait for a bit. You can see... Joint entrance exams are going on... Cut it. Cut the light. You don't have to be so mad at what I had said. I am not angry. Not at my age. Does one need a certain age to be angry? There's an age for everything. A relationship also ages. Then why not emotions? I can't ask that TV crew to shoot in our bedroom. That's why I asked you to wrap up the class. Arindam, you might be a famous director in front of the world... ...but I am a teacher to those kids. They look up to me. I am setting the question paper... I am coaching them... After today, they will definitely think it's all a farce. But they will still have to come for your coaching classes... ...to know the questions... Right? What are you saying? They respect me like their mother. But that does not make you their mother. What's wrong? What happened? Why was she breathing like that? What's wrong? It's the baby, you know. Wh...What about the baby? Arindam... We can't have the baby. What do you mean by "we can't have the baby"? What is wrong? - We have lost the baby. - What? We have lost the baby. But... It was only last week... See, in a way, it's good because... ...we detected the problem early on. No, no, no, no... Last week, what day was it? It was Friday. You said that everything is fine... Did you not say everything is fine? - What happened in one week? - You can't react like this. You have to take care of her. Sit. Please sit, Arindam. Now, you have to take care of Ishita. Cool down. Arindam, you'll have to be strong. You have to be strong. We even thought of names, Doctor. I can understand. But now you'll have to take care of her. You'll have to do it. Yeah, hello. Suri? Yes, Mrs. Roy Chowdhury... This is Suri. Boss is taking a shot. Okay. I called because of the weather. What happened? Its raining cats and dogs. Where are you guys? We are inside the studio. That's why had no clue. Okay. It's okay. How much longer? It's the song sequence... We are almost done. Oh... I've to go now. Hopefully, the rain will stop soon. Tell your boss to get home safely. Okay? Okay. Don't worry. All is well. It was as if... ...in the middle of the night. You feel totally healthy. And they give you this kind of juice that stops your world. More people die of cancer every year. Than all the deaths... There was a lot of anger. Anger with God... Why is this happening to me? I think... You must face the reality. This night belongs to you and me The moon belongs to you and me Just the two of us Tonight is only for music This moment belongs to our souls To talk our hearts out What am I being punished for? Did I ask you to get wet? Getting wet is not the punishment. You are leaving me alone? It hurts. I exist because of you I feel you in my senses I exist because of you I feel you in my senses Just the two of us This night belongs to you and me The moon belongs to you and me Just the two of us What happened? What? Where? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. What can go wrong with me? I'm fine. Where were you all night? I have been calling since last evening. Oh, yes... I was stuck in the rain. And my car stopped working. And my phone... - It was a total mess... - Where were you all night? I...er...was at the studio... You should have informed me, Arindam. I was going crazy. If you were a little later... I would have called the police. Suri's phone was also switched off. And I didn't have anyone else's number from your team. Do you know how I was feeling? I am here now. Am I not? I'm here. I'm fine. Everything is fine. Calm down. CHAPTER FOUR MY NIGHT COMES TO AN END What happened? Why are you quiet. Say something. Everything was fine yesterday. - What happened to you suddenly... - Ranja! I am married. How does that matter? What do you mean? Did you know? That I am married. Yes! Everyone knows... I also knew... Even then.. Even you knew you were married. How does that make a difference? - You... - So... No one can fall in love once they get married? Don't try to tell me all this now. Why are you doing this? Because of last night? Or have you fallen in love with me? Shut up! And go. Go! You can shut me up. But can you shut the voice in your head? Can you do it? Animals We are just a bunch of animals Pretending, pretending, pretending Like we make a difference I am best film. I am best director. Surprise! Why didn't you say anything in the morning? Am I bad luck? Is that a thing to say, Ishi? You didn't say anything, that's why I mentioned it. I didn't know I was going to win. Neither did you know you would lose. What kind of celebration is this, Ishi? How do you want to celebrate? Just...just...look at your attitude... If only I could frame you like this... ...it would have been great... Now, make a film on me. I left everybody to come to you. I thought we will celebrate. Such a huge award function, so much recognition. I left everything for you. Really? This is a newspaper sponsered award show. Is that how you prefer being recognised now? Just... Just, what is it? What are you trying to say, Ishita? You know better than me, Arindam. The way these awards are judged. No... What are you trying to say? You think I don't deserve these awards. Or I have bought these. Which one is it? I think these awards don't matter. The fact that you were able to make the film the way you wanted, isn't that enough? I am not writing poetry, okay. Poetry is not that ambitious. It is happy in a torn notebook. It does not get sold off in the market like your films. Next time I make a film, hang it on the wall... And put some garlands while you are at it. Torn notebook? You? Were you expecting someone else? Am I supposed to expect you home at this hour? Are you supposed to be getting back now? There was a small gathering. So, who was there? People from the school. You won't know them. How come you are home so early? Wasn't feeling well. You haven't slept all night... How can you sleep without your bed? Is that you? - What? - The perfume. I have never got this smell before. Must have been a gift from you. Too strong for my taste. Maybe your taste has changed. If you want to shoot for longer, you have to give the manager a role. Put him in the background. You are good at all this. Okay. Listen. Tell the heroine drinking so many coolers is not good. She will lose her voice. Go, tell her. Go. Director is saying don't drink so many coolers, you'll lose your voice. I am not not drinking it for my throat but for my head. And listen... Ask the director not to become a doctor. Not for her throat. She drinking to keep her head cool. - And... - And? Be a director. Not a doctor. Tell her we can find someone to massage her head... But it will be difficult to find someone for the throat. I have already found someone. Just have to come down the throat. What do I say now? Nothing. You deal with the manager. Okay. Suri, listen. Call my home. Call Ma'am? On the cell phone? No, on the landline. It's ringing off... Great! Let it be... Go check when we can start the shoot. Tell her. Why are you keeping it a secret? - We are not... - Where will she go? Where will she go? She doesn't have anyone else in this world apart from me. Then, we'll go somewhere. Why does she have to leave? You are the one leaving her. Yeah, that's right. I'm the one leaving her. You should tell her now. You are setting her free. You love someone... And you are living with someone else. Are you doing the right thing? I don't know how exactly will she react. What do you think? Can I show you? What? Wait. Give me the cue. What? Oh, give me your lines... Oh, okay. Ishita, I'm with someone else. I'll have to let you go. - What is this? - What? What are you doing? If you don't feel it, how will Ishita? You have to feel it. Come on. I know you can do it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. One more time. Quickly. Ishita, I am with an obnoxious, vengeful brat... That's why, I'll have to let you go. Done? Go on. You need her way more than you need me. How was it? Wasn't that a good impression? It was good. But you were wrong. Then you do it. She is your wife after all. Hey, what happened? Ishita, I've had enough. Now, I'm leaving you. I want to leave you too, Arindam. I can't live with you anymore. Really? Do you want some single malt? It's really good stuff. You are the man, Hrishi-Da. Of course, I'll have some. What are you filming right now? Some rubbish... Even if you try you can't make rubbish. After all, you've trained under me. But don't make anything too long... Nowadays, the attention span of the audience... ...is very short. I am making a modern "Charulata"... "Charukatha". How much longer are Bengalis going to eat off of Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray? No, actually... Not really Ray's "Charulata"... I am trying to interpret Charu's character in a new way. Whenever you see... ...no matter how you see... Once a lonely wife, always a lonely wife. Thank you. So... What should we say cheers to? Life. And love! Now, tell me what is bugging you? I have fallen in love. Everything has become very confusing, Hrishi-Da. Love, trust, faith, responsibilty. It is indeed quite confusing. Always been confusing. And still is. Love. Sometimes, it's the train. Sometimes, it's the station. You have to board and get off at the right time. No... And it's not just me... There are other lives involved. Always are. I am thinking about myself... No, I'm not thinking about myself... Stop feeling guilty first. There is nothing purer than love. Ask me. There's never been a time when I didn't fall in love. Sometimes, with the same woman... Sometimes... You are confusing me even more, Hrishi-Da. Kiddo, this is something, you'll have to do on your own. All I can tell you is that... ...if you don't feel it... ...don't fake it. And if you feel it... Don't f*** it up... Now, tell me what is the occasion? I never forget a date. There's no occasion. Just like that. Just like that. Then why didn't we go to Flambé? We are dining out after so long. Flambé wouldn't have been appropriate for today... Why? This place is nice too. What's the issue? Of course, it's nice. Prices must be nice too. I...had... something to say... They make tapas here. Shall we get some? Yes. Ishita... ...for a long time now... ...I've been trying to say something to you... ...but I haven't. I also... ...have something to say... You too? We all have our secrets. Don't we? Tell me. To tell you the truth... ...I can't say it. You can do it. Tell me. - You go first. - No. You first. Maybe, after you, I won't have to say anything at all. It can't be the same thing. Might not be the same secret but... ...it might have the same solution. But not right now. Let's not spoil this lovely meal. Seems like the old you is back... The old you... After so long... Really? Charming. Vulnerable. Dying to impress. Oh god! Who are these people? I had written about you. In my diary. After that first Flambé date. What were you going to tell me? You first. No, you first. Not here... This is not the right... Where do you want to go? Our spot... I stay behind you I walk before you Weaving dreams Eyes lie awake I have lost myself So that I can allure you again You are not allowed to react. What do you mean? No matter what I say, you can't react. You mean... Even if I am involved I can't? You are supposed to be involved in everything I do. Isn't it? Yes... Now tell me. I'm... I'm dying, Arindam. What? Of cancer. What? You mean... What is this? What stage? I have six months. Can I ask you why you didn't tell me before? Why? You can ask me. What was going to be the point? Would you hear me? When was the last time you heard me? Today, you had something to say to me, that's why you are here. I've been dying a little everyday in front of you. I had a choice that night. To tell you both the truths. One that your son is dead. The other that your wife is dying. Which night are you talking about? Did you know that day? We lost the baby because of the cancer. And... The cancer was diagnosed so late because of the pregnancy. No, no, no... We can still try... We can still try... - I can still do something... - Dr. Bakshi has tried everything. Remember those... ...post-school getaways? I didn't want to tell you at all. Today, the old Arindam... I couldn't keep it in anymore. I can't live alone like this any more. Why will you live alone? Why will you be alone? Why? You could have told me, at least, once. Why didn't you tell me? For so long... Now you tell me... What's your secret? I am sure it is happier than mine. Tell me something nice. Let it be. There's no need. What is there to hide from me, Arindam? No, actually... I mean... Sit here. Please sit. We hardly go out... I've been busy, all this time... I was planning a vacation for our tenth anniversary. Really? That's next month. We can go. Can't we? Yes, let's see what the doctor says. What will the doctor say? Starting next week... ...he is making me quit school. The lights are going out, Arindam. The lights are going out. CHAPTER FIVE You... You couldn't tell her. You are saying this even after knowing everything? Instead of telling her anything, you just heard her story. She is dying, Ranja. You want me to divorce her now? Then? Send her "get well soon" cards. How horrible are you? You have to learn to be patient. Go to your patient. Darling, I've come to meet you. Are you really meeting me? That's all I have to say, children. But before we felicitate Ma'am Ishita Roy Chowdhury... ...I would like to wish her all the very best... ...on whatever journey she chooses to embark upon next. May I now request Ma'am Ishita Roy Chowdhury... ...to please come and say a few words. A big hand for Ma'am Ishita Roy Chowdhury. When I started teaching 10 years back... ...I didn't get my first job on my own merit. I can share that secret now. A friend helped me. But I wouldn't have taken that job... ...if I didn't believe in myself. If I didn't believe I was good enough. If I didn't believe that I could be responsible for all of you. That's all I have to say, children. Believe in yourself. I know you are all going to do me very proud. Believe in yourself. No matter what anyone says. No matter what anyone does. Find your own rose. Your own unique beauty. I know you are all longing to go out and play. For the last time... - Good afternoon, children! - Good afternoon, Miss. Thank you. Thank you so much. Remember you would come to drop me off everyday... And you would pick me up from office. You would wait right there in the car till I was all the way in. Yes. And you would roam around in my office till my work got done. Why did everything stop? You had receeded into yourself, Ishi. And I... I used to think, I had failed you, Arindam. You wanted Arish so much. I just couldn't... Forget about it, Ishi. We don't need to waste any more time. We've been through enough. Come. Time is what we don't have anymore. There is... There is... There is a lot of time. We have to create huge moments in such short lives. A lot of huge moments, Senorita! Come. - Senorita? - Yes. I must apologise to Arindam. Actually, whatever Ishita wanted... ...I was doing exactly that. No, it's okay. You respected her decision. That's fine by me. See, more than the disease, the treatment is very painful. And we always encourage the patients to share the pain with their loved ones. It's not possible physically. But give her as much mental support as you can. She didn't want you to suffer. By the way, watched your last film on DVD. Don't mind my saying it... Great movie! But why did you kill her at the end? Her new life began with the death. Isn't it, Doc? You people know how to talk... No arguing about that. Okay, so... We will continue with the treatment. A friend of mine from Geneva... ...has sent me a new set of findings about ovarian stem cell cancer. I'm forwarding all this to Dr. Hazra. She is not responding to medicines. But we have to keep trying. And... We must start radiations right away. Doc? You've kept all my requests... - Can I make a last request? - Sure. Tell me. I'm not going to live. I know that. You know that. And he knows that. You don't have to give us false hopes. Just reduce my pain if you can. Take the medicines, at least. You must go for that vacation. It's a great, great idea. Go somewhere nearby... I will set up all the medical aid from here. That's...that's very kind of you, Doc. Thank you. Be with her. As much as you can. Let the light come in That same breeze Getting back a favorite toy A liitle bit of the sky Clouds let us know In blue drops The rain falls I know at the edge of the night There's a dilapidated house The train rips through the darkness In the land of lullabies Waterfalls in disguise Scatters the songs of our memories In the laughter The hand caresses Unfathomable illusion Let the sky laterns float higher Favourite breeze Returns suddenly Let the light come in That same breeze Getting back a favorite toy Don't think I'm at this bad a state. Just move a little. You know, I am a little happy... Why? I don't have to act in front of you anymore. Really... You are a damn good actor, Ishi. I had no clue. You never let it on. Would you have been able to finish your film if you caught me? Sea or mountains? Director's cut. Nope. Star's choice. Okay. Count to three. Okay. One... Two... Three... Devilled crabs. Pepper devilled crabs? Does anyone write obituaries for those waves? Obituary? Their journey ends here... Is anyone keeping note? Where did it come from? How many waves did it fight with? How many boats did it float? How many fish it played with? There is someone. These sands are keeping score, Ishi. You just have to hear them. Hey... Slow down... Slow down! I became night for you A new morning The needle of an alarm clock I became air for you I stayed stubborn I kept changing I have lost myself So that I can allure you again Three gone, three to go... Remember? How was our fourth, Arindam? A little laughter, a little sorrow, a little spicy, a little sour, a little sweet... All in all, a secret recipe for a good film. For a poem too... Thank you. What if you don't find me? You will wait for me, won't you? CHAPTER FIVE I WILL FIND YOU AGAIN How...how much is this for? 100 rupees. Oh, you? How are you? - Are you very busy? - No. Free for a cup of coffee. Let's go. So... Whatever happened between us was nothing? No. Why would it be nothing? Whatever happened between us... ...I don't want to trivialise it by giving it some name. There are lots of terms in the dictionary... But as you grow older... ...you will be in more relationships... Then you'll realise it yourself. How you want to remember our relationship... ...those moments... But she is no more. Then why can't we... Because I love her more than ever now. Yes, there were a few days then... ...I had loved her a little less. But... ...now that she is no more... ...I have been able to love her a lot more. You'll understand one day... Didn't get a chance to tell you this before... So, I'm telling you now... You did a great job in your first film. Charu... Take care of yourself. Do even better work. Have to go now. Crazy... Crazy... Arindam, some relationships are timeless. The love remains. Even when the lovers are no more.
