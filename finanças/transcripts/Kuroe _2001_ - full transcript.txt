This film, inspired by Boris Vian's 'Froth on the Daydream'... ...is unfaithful to the world of the novel. You will now gaze on a flat surface on which light is filtered... ...by objects unearthed from below and transformed by the sun. I suddenly realized everyone was saying bad things about me... ...behind my back. It came to me in a flash, and I said to myself, 'I see... ' When I stared at my hands... ...there was sand falling from my fingertips. I kept trying to brush it away, but it was the strangest thing... ...the sand wasn't stuck to my fingers. My fingers were turning into sand. They were turning to sand and crumbling away... ...and even my hands were disappearing. I thought how.. ...in the end I'd lose first my arms and then my whole body. So in this dream... ...I turn completely into sand. What can that possibly mean? Please, Doctor! Tell me! I'm not a doctor. You're an astronomer, aren't you? What do the stars say about this kind of thing? The stars I know aren't those stars. Oh. Your stars aren't much use, are they. Another 30 degrees. A little bit more... That's good. Huh? You shouldn't be in here. Sorry, there's no show today. Go up to the observatory. They're looking at sunspots. Give us our rights! Down with the system! Give us equality! No more! No more! Give us our rights! Think about the system! Don't do that to me! You're slow, Kotaro! Talking to the stars again? Yeah, to Capricorn. What did it say? Gemini wanted its pelt. What? Then give it to them! Come on! Watch it! Careful! I mean, stars... ...don't change in a whole lifetime. What's so interesting? It's a lot better than buying every Kitano thing you can find! You bought some more? What?! Oh, no... That's the same one that you bought last time! It's not the same thing at all! It's a first edition! But it's the same damn book! What do you know? Look at the lesser panda's tail. It goes the other way! Yeah, you're right. Kitano's amazing. It's like his pictures move. He just bought 27 pictures of lesser pandas. He's crazy! They're all different! The world he creates is something beyond our grasp. There's a philosophy underpinning it. A turning point in history needs someone like him to express it! What's that got to do with you? It's his philosophy that appeals to me. I'm not just a 'Kitano freak'. I get what I'm missing from him. I envy how you can make do with nothing. You've got Hidemi! Hm? Yeah, she's great. Kotaro! You've got to fall in love. It's the best thing... ...in the world. Keep it down! Yeah, it moved. Will a low sound do it, too? Kotaro! Telephone. What's that? Practice. Screaming? Of course I'd like to come. No, I'd be happy to. Sorry? 'Tokyo Opera City'? I've never been there. I'm so happy you came! Congratulations. Thank you! Come visit us once in a while! Yes! We always wonder how you are, and Riko would love to see you! After all, we're your only relatives. Thank you. Have you seen the paintings? No, not yet. Take your time. It's free to look! Mr Saegusa's here, Mom. He is? Mr Saegusa! Hey, you're all dressed up. I guess so... you've got a suit on, too. Quite the show. My mother has no taste. Let's get out of here and go somewhere. We can't do that! But this can't be much fun. I'll introduce you to a girl, then. No. This place makes my head spin. I'll go find a corner somewhere. You're like an old man! Riko, come here! Come visit us. Before I kill my parents. Having fun? You can sit there. Sorry? I've sat long enough. No... I didn't want to sit. Uh, are you here with anyone? You weren't talking to anyone... That's 'cause I don't know anyone. What brings you here? Me? I work... ...at a cleaner's near the artist's house. She asked me to come. Oh, so that's it... Yep. Uh... Yes? Are you tired? I'm sorry? Uh... ...do you paint? Paint? Yes... You know, pictures... That's a strange question. Why? Everyone's painted pictures. Oh... ...I guess so. So how can you split the world into those who paint and those who don't? You're right. So do you like my aunt's pictures? No. Yeah! Great! I was afraid everyone liked them. I don't think she really likes painting. And colors are so beautiful just by themselves... ...that you wonder why she bothers if she doesn't like doing it. She likes the praise. Oh, I can praise her... ...for how rich she is, and how well she puts her foot in her mouth. Uh... ...what's your name? Kuroe. Like the Duke Ellington song? Wow! You know 'Chloe'? No one else ever does. They just think it's a weird name. 'Kuroe'... Yep. Written 'black bough'. Look... The planetarium... I went there in elementary school. It was depressing. Depressing? I cried. I felt like it was pressing in on me. There's so many stars! 200 billion in the Milky Way alone. Even I feel like that's too many. That's why they made up constellations. Well, maybe not, but somebody made them up, anyway. So sometimes I make up my own. Like what? I'm not boring you? Not at all. It's weird... I don't usually talk about myself so much. I'm sorry. You talk for a while. Me? There's not much to say. I've never really done anything. I don't know very much. I only finished middle school. Um... Listen... Can I see you again? Sure. You don't have to shout! What did you say? OK, OK! Hang on... What? I don't know what to wear, where to go, what to say... What have I done?! We drove and drove and drove... ...just to plant some beans. Oh, help! Ow! That hurt! Kotaro, stop gazing at me! What are you worried about? He's looking at me, not you. Aren't you, Kotaro. Yep. Kuroe! I just love that bracelet of yours! Yeah? You want it? Are you sure? Oh, please! It's me! Yeah! You're still ugly. Gee, thanks. You'll just rust it. Who wants beer? You get the beer, Chibi! This is your bar. Homos don't lift heavy things! Get Bro to do it, then. At least let Kotaro sit down! Yeah! Boys and girls sitting next to each other? That's disgusting! But it's OK if it's homos? Sure. Go away, will you? Kuroe... You know what? You're the first woman Kotaro's ever brought here. Shut up, Bro! So be good to him. He's a great guy. You don't have to worry about Kotaro. He takes things at his own pace. He never rebelled. He just never grew up. I did so! You never rebelled? I did! You're still a boy... A good day's work, Mr Businessman! Take care going home to your family! Read the Bible sometime! Fashionable young lady in the purple blouse! You are loved! And you, ma'am! You, too, the girl with the dyed hair and the cigarette! Mr Salaryman, you are loved! May God bless you! And this young lady, too... Be happy. Don't catch cold! Thank you. I'm a minister, believe it or not. When you get married, call me. You are loved. 'Bye, now. You on your way home, good evening... My friends must have tired you out. They're a lot of fun. Yeah, they are. It's because of you. You have this relaxing air about you. That's not true. I'm just dull. No, it's true. Are you cold? No. No? But I don't mind if you walk closer to me. What? You're kidding... About what? I like you. Me, too. What?! What? I just never dreamed you'd feel the same way. To tell the truth, I liked you from the moment I first saw you. You looked so weird... I just wanted to keep on looking at you. I want to stay with you. Me, too. What? I mean 'forever', you know. Not just tonight. Forever. Yeah. Me, too. Until we're 70 or 80. All wrinkled... Sure! I don't believe this! I've just met you! I love you more than anybody! Me, too. Isn't that weird! I don't even know you! But you do know me. I feel that. Are you glad you met me? Yes! That's great! Thanks! Congratulations! Hurry! Quick! Kuroe, you're beautiful! Say that again! You're very beautiful! Hug me! I'm so happy I can't stand it! Kotaro, you are about to take Kuroe as your wife. Do you promise to love, respect, console and aid her... ...in sickness and in health, for richer for poorer... ...so long as you both shall live? I do. Kuroe, you are about to take Kotaro as your husband. Do you promise to love, respect, console and aid him... ...in sickness and in health, for richer for poorer... ...so long as you both shall live? I do. I want a fun wedding. What about her parents? They're not around. No? She's always been alone. What do you mean? Change the subject! You have pledged in the sight of witnesses and of God. In the name of God the Father... ...I now pronounce you man and wife. Whom God hath joined together, let none put asunder. Amen. We have here a new couple. Bless them with your applause. Kuroe! Where's the door? This way. Kuroe! It's OK. I'm fine. Thanks for coming. Have a good time. Kotaro... Congratulations. Thanks. Enjoy yourself. I don't care if they're not Christian. 'Let all who wish enter. ' Jesus didn't have such a tight ass. I heard that! It's been so long! A tight ass! I love this guy! Are you drinking? Matsu! Matsu! Are you drinking? Are you? Are you OK? Sorry. Eisuke! Can I talk to you? What? Why? Come on! I'm flying tonight! You are. Thanks. You should have seen your face! What do you expect? What's up? You're drunk. Yep. It feels great! Kotaro... ...I'm happy. Eisuke... ...don't get mad, OK? I've saved a lot of money. I never spent it on anything. I've got ?8 million. ?8 million? Wow! Why should that make me mad? Can I give you ?2 million? So you and Hidemi can settle down. If you pay your debts, you can live on your jobs now. What the hell are you talking about? Kuroe's all I need. I want things to go well for you. For my sake as well as yours. I want everyone I like to be happy, too. I don't believe this! Kotaro... ...thanks. I'll get it together. Thanks. Thanks. Is this OK? Us? Living in a great place like this? Kuroe! Watch out! Careful! Kuroe! Kuroe! Kuroe! Hm? Kuroe! What happened? Let's find a doctor. I'm OK. I just got too happy. Don't do that! You scared me! Look over there. Stars... I've never seen them like that... Don't cough, please. I can't stop it. Count to ten. One, two... ...three, four... ...six, seven... You missed 'five'... Sorry. Hang on... What does that look like? I see a flowerbud. Why? I don't know. All I know is that it's stopping one of her lungs from functioning. I don't know if that's why she fainted. However... ...I think it should be removed. An operation? There are two lungs. Without this tumor, the one might do the work of both. I've got to get myself together. Otherwise I can't help anyone. This is amazing. It really was a flowerbud. I'm no botanist, but it looks like a water-lily. How's Kuroe? She'll be fine. What about this? Throw it away. Hello. Where should I put this? Throw it out, I said! No! I want to see it. Why? I grew it inside me. Show me. It's pretty... OK? I'm fine. Kuroe! Are you OK? Can you walk? I guess you can. I can walk! Welcome back. I'll carry that. You're sure you're OK? Yes! So I needn't have worried... Careful! I'm worried about you! You look fine. The Y-shaped formation of stars that form Virgo... ...are the Goddess Astraes, with wheat sheaves in her hand. Long, long ago, in the Age of Gold, the fields gave their fruits... ...without labor... ...and the rivers flowed with milk and wine. Humankind did not know war... ...and the Gods lived with us here on earth. But then the seasons were born, and people built houses... ...and made clothes... ...and had to plant seeds and raise crops. The strong began to torment the weak... ...and the Gods lost their love for the earth and retired into heaven. Only Astraes believed in humanity, and remained on the earth. I didn't cry this time. I love you. Sorry? As long as we're together, I'm fine. What do you mean? There's a face! There's the nose! And the mouth! Time to go, everyone! We're going! Come on, we're leaving. Time to stop. We're going. What school do you go to? Is your mom here? Wait a minute! Hold it! Wait! Ow! What are you doing?! Stop that! Come here! You're not tired? No, I'm fine. This is the 'lab'. 'Lab'? Hey, it's that boy... I don't know what to do. We have to leave... Wait here. Has this boy done something? Jacket! Do you know this boy? Well, not exactly... Who is he? I've just seen him around here. Do you mean that on a school day... ...you simply let a child wander around here alone? Well, you know... Have you checked his pockets? I'm sure that won't be necessary. What's your name? He won't say! That's why I'd like you to check. I see... there's nothing here. Has this boy done something? Are you his mother? No. This is my wife. What exactly is going on here?! Uh, nothing... Where'd he go? 'You look like you've had a hard journey.' 'I'm sorry I have no star you can buy, but this is business.' 'However, and on her palm he placed a sparkling grain of sand...' 'This is a tiny, tiny piece of star.' 'You can have it.' Is that the end? Well, she goes on to become happy. I wonder why it takes so long... In real life, things move faster. Want some apple? No. Give me a kiss instead. No way. Why not? I won't want to stop. So what? Vigorous exercise is bad for you right now. Then don't be vigorous. Be gentle. It's been a long time. Just a kiss, then. More. Chibi... Did you find a taxi right away? What's wrong? I don't know. I don't know. I just feel really sad. Come in and sit down. Let's have a drink. Are you all better, Kuroe? Yeah. Every day I sunbathe... ...I go for walks, I clean... I do lots of things. Yeah? Oh, and laundry. I do laundry. I love laundry! I didn't realize it when I was working... ...but I like seeing clothes come clean. The things you learn when it's too late! But you're not supposed to go very far, are you? Not really. Apartment and neighborhood, that's my world right now. But there I've got everything, and anything can happen. Life is fun, Chibi! Kuroe, you're so nice! Kotaro's lucky. We had fun, didn't we. 'Had'... I know, I know! 'You've got to do something, not just sit there.' I know that! I just start feeling so sad! Where's Eisuke? That slack-shit asshole won't even pay his bar bill! I really wonder now why you and him are such good friends. Chibi! But they still come in, don't they? You can be sad with people around. Sometimes they make it worse. Yeah? It's worse for me since I met you. That's right... when he's at work, you're all alone. Yeah. I don't mind being alone. I'm used to that. But for a while after Kotaro goes out... ...I'm sad. Don't look at me like that! What can I do? That's how much I love you. That priest never came back. I wonder where he went... Chibi! Is he the reason you're sad? What are you talking about? That's a completely different thing! Kuroe, let's have a drink. We're friends, aren't we? She can't drink yet! Just one! She can't! I'll mix it really weak! No! Oh, what the hell. Kuroe! It'll be all right. We're friends! Oh, shit! It's all my fault! Help her! Coming through! Kuroe! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Tell us both. It's back. In the other lung? Bloody hell... Let's go home. Kuroe! What can we do? It's not the doctor's fault. He can't operate again, can he. Doctor... ...when it blooms... ...will I die? Home's best. Isn't that sun grand... Kotaro... I really don't want to die, you know. Dying... ...scares me. I don't want to die! It's OK. Somehow... ...I'll find a way to cure you! It's OK. For you. Here... Thanks. Does it hurt? A bit. But not very much. You sound hoarse... If she drinks water... ...the flower grows. Of all the places for the damn thing to grow... How's Eisuke? Good. He bought me a blouse. With hearts on it. Wow! He was so proud of himself. Do you wear it? No way! Hearts! Kuroe! Good. OK. I'm amazed. You're a lot better. Really? Those other flowers scared it! It's just embarrassed. Whichever, the air flow in the one lung is back to normal. The one we operated on, though, is hardly working at all. I don't care, as long as I've got one. I don't want to worry you... ...but be careful. I will. OK, Kuroe, we'll buy more flowers. We'll fill the room with them! Wow! It'll be our apartment, and the flowers'. But why me? Kotaro... ...I hate this country. That damn teacher complained. Um... ...take this. Hello. You're home? Hi. I'm back. I got flowers. Thanks. They're pretty. There's so much to do around a house... It's fun. The woman next door... ...I said hello and she didn't answer. She just went inside? She seems to think what I've got is contagious. Why? Who knows? That's what she seems to think. I wonder why... Have you ever taken a dislike to someone you'd never met? Yes, I have. You have... Why? Haven't you? I have. I lost my job. Why? What's wrong with you? It's funny! A water lily doesn't send out spores. My wife's illness isn't... Artificial flowers might be cheaper. We tried that. You did? Chibi brought some and said at least they wouldn't wither... ...and Bro got real mad at him. And they didn't work? No. It's pretty smart for a flower. Damn the thing! But she's a lot better. Anyway, Eisuke... ...how much of that money have you got left? I don't want it back. But it might be a while before she gets better... ...and I was wondering if I could borrow it from you? Oh. Well... ...there's about ?200,000. You're kidding! I found... ...a notebook of Kitano's from before he was published. It's the only one like it! If I'd passed it up, I'd never see it again! Don't worry about Hidemi. She's plenty happy! Listen... ...come to my place. I'll show you the notebook. No, thanks. Kotaro... ...I'll never leave Hidemi. It'll all work out. Something like this happened in a Kitano book. Yeah? It may have built up a tolerance to the other flowers. I guess... ...I should be more supportive. Look at this. It's my wife. I knew it! Everyone laughs when they see this. But why is it so funny? I don't know. Sorry. What? You quit your job? Why? So if you have any work... Young people today! They're just beyond me. What was it that you do, anyway? I love Kuroe. Well, I'd like to help you, and I intend to. But you've always just done what you wanted... Um... ...I'll do anything. People who say that are the first to quit. This disease of your wife's, is it contagious? Kotaro! Wait! I'm sorry we can't help you. But take this. Flowers help her, don't they? You can have it. Don't be shy! Go on, take it! I have a question! Why do people work? Money... Money? Money. I asked why we work! What kind of an answer is that? You need money to live! Stupid! Stupid! No! No! That answer's no good. Not an answer. Why can't you live... ...without money? I know! Without money, you can't buy anything. That's right! 'All together now'... So... what? Without money you can't buy anything? No, you can't! You can still trade, can't you? Trade? Yeah... for example, here... This is yours. Thanks. And this is mine. I want that. You want this. What now? I want this and that. OK. I'll give it to you. Wow! You're giving it to me? Is that ever nice! See? I feel like giving it to you, and you're happy to have two. Isn't that good? We're all happy. You're happy, aren't you? You've got two. And where's the money? Nowhere! I win. Hey, wait! That's not right. What's wrong with it? Eisuke! How about this... Enough! What? Sorry. He's our resident idiot. If he's bothering you, I'll put him in the garbage. All right, then! Piss off! You're drunk! OK, here's another one... Again? Why do we have to work? If you really want to work, that's OK. But why do we always think we have to work? Why? The same with laws, and customs. Why do we think we have to uphold them? All they are is rules lots of people have decided on. Society, too. What is 'society', anyway? Where is it? Have you ever seen it? Have you ever seen 'society'? No, you haven't! It's something you've decided is something like this. Or like this? Or this? It doesn't exist! But you think it's there, because if it isn't... ...you get scared. It's scary to have to be free. So all you do is talk using words you borrow from someone else. There's no one who lives doing just what he wants to do. Except for Kotaro and Kuroe, maybe. They're amazing. One who likes stars, and one who likes laundry! Who the hell's 'Kuroe'? Shut the fuck up! It's not funny. Do you dumb bitches think... ...I'm going to let you laugh at her?! All you're doing is borrowing words from Kitano. What? Hey, wait a minute... These are my words I'm speaking. I might be drunk, but what I said is right. Why do we need society? Who needs it? Give me a break! I want to be free. I want to dance! I want to dance free! I want to dance! There's an expression girls like you always use... 'Who gives a shit?' Well, you're right. Just keep saying that: 'Who gives a shit?' Do what you want. Do what you want, and only what you want! So... what should we do? Love. Love! Let's fall in love, Miss. Love is wonderful! Let's make love! So all that was just a come-on! Love's potato! Eisuke! So how come you spend all day making dental implants? Is that what you want to do? Yo... how's Jesus? He's fine. He's with you even now. Oh? What's he doing here? Why isn't he at Kotaro's place? Eisuke! Why did Kuroe get sick? What did she do wrong?! Having that wedding when she's not Christian? That has nothing to do with it. Then why won't your damn Jesus help her?! That's not what he does. Then what good is he? Jesus neither makes things nor destroys them. He gives the strength to go on living... ...to people who make him their friend. Then who gives a shit. He's not my friend. Or theirs. But they're your friends. What can you do for them? What can you do for them?! I wish I knew. And what are you doing? Leaving him alone and drinking here? We have to talk. They told me you called where I work. Don't do that, OK? Then return my calls. Yeah, yeah... You don't have to look like that! I'm just a little late. Don't be such a drag! Give me my money! I will. Well? Come on! I don't have it. All right, let's go to your place and get it! Wait a minute! I just got here! I'm talking to these ladies! Bullshit! Fuck you! Cut it out! No! Stop it! Eisuke! I said I'd pay you! Why can't you wait?! No! Don't! He started it! Get out! Forget the money you owe me, but don't ever come back in here. Go away, will you? I told you, he's not here! Get away from me! Don't touch me! Go away! I'll go see him. You don't know where he is. No. But I'll find him. People don't change so fast. All that changes is what's around them. You're a nice guy, Kotaro. But he doesn't need me anymore. Hidemi... Don't worry. I won't do anything stupid. What about you? Take good care of Kuroe. Hi. Kotaro... ...let's forget about the flowers. What? You've gotten better! Yeah. Enough is enough. Take some time and find a decent job. You won't have to work to buy flowers. Spend more time with me. I'm working so I can do that! Um... ...listen... Kuroe, no! Don't think like that! I'm not. It's something simpler. What do you want?! To be with you. That's why I'm working! I know. I know that. But... ...no more flowers. Please, just be with me. Let's see things together. Every day I find something new. I want to see those things with you. There's not much time. Don't talk like that! I'm dying. Kuroe! I'm sorry. But everyone's dying. From the moment they're born. So right now, while I'm still on the way there... ...I want to be with you. Just be with you. Only that. Yeah... ...I understand. I'll take care of you. So... ...let me try a little harder. I understand. Kuroe... Why do you say that when you don't? I do. You're trying your best. Thank you. Don't talk like that. But... If you don't understand, say so. It's not like you. OK... ...what should I say? How would I know?! No! Kitano! Kitano! Kitano! Kitano! We are trivial as mackerel. Mackerel are trivial. They're blue. They smell. And they're fish. Boiled, salted, dried... ...sushi, marinated or fried... ...I hate mackerel. I hate mackerel! Why do male fish come all over the roe? Why not in female fish? Are fish eggs really that exciting? But people are worse. They're pointless. They have no more meaning than a mackerel. People pay ?20,000 for my used kleenexes. I say pay me a million! Switchover. Midnight: ...the sky over Tokyo. You can't see the stars... ...for reflected light from the city. Hey... Look at the eastern sky. Venus, the dawn star. You must be tired. But that's life. Soon... it will be daybreak. We get paid for sitting here doing nothing. What will this day... ...bring for everyone? Have you been doing this job long? A year now. I'll be 29 soon. Yo. Come in. Ow! These places get smaller all the time! How's Hidemi? Well, she was acting like nothing had happened... ...but I'm sure him vanishing like that was a shock. I wonder what she'll do... They say water lilies pop when they bloom. 'Pop!' Is Kotaro at work? Yes. At least he could get weekends off... But it's me he's out working for. Kuroe... I just wish he wasn't quite so sharp. He's a good person. Yeah. It's a harsh world. Yeah. But a better one now. Why? It was easy to make myself happy when I was alone. With two people it's been harder, but it's better... ...than it was. In all the time I've been alive, the one right thing I've done... ...was to fall in love with Kotaro. If I hadn't loved him, I couldn't have loved the rest of you. I'm awful. Well... ...I just want to be in time. Bro... I'm sorry. I'm too stupid to understand what you're saying. Bro... If I could just understand, then you'd be happier... Today... ...I swept outside the front door. Then I wiped the clothes-line. Then that boy came over, and we drew pictures. I've still got crayon in my nails. Thank you, Kotaro. I love you. Yo. More flowers? How's Hidemi? She's fine. She's really something. She's paying off your debts. But they came and took away your collection. They did? Good. That's a relief. I kept this notebook of his with me, though. It should be worth a little bit. Buy flowers with it. You're not going back? You don't want to see her? How could I? Eisuke! You know better than anyone that I never give up. Mr Kitano? Are you Mr Kitano? Who told you I was here? I want to talk to you. You shouldn't be here. How did you get in? Are you Mr Kitano? That's right. Who are you? Sugiyama! Sugiyama! Sugiyama! Look at all this! What did you want? I want you to stop publishing. I can't really do that, you know. I've got my own life to live. Please. And I've just finished a new book. All I have to do now is wrap it and send it out. I see... Perhaps you wouldn't mind telling me... ...why you want me to stop? Well... ...is it true that everything about this world is trivial? Yes. You and me, we're trivial, too? Yep. So it's true! What a relief! Take off that jacket, OK? Why? Come here. What's the connection? I can't explain. Because now I'm going to kill you. What? It's beautiful... How much is this worth? I don't know. But... Then I wouldn't know either. You're always in here. Do you like flowers that much? I don't know. Why not come work for me? You could take home what's left over. Or you could buy cheap from the wholesalers. We interrupt with this news bulletin. The picture-book artist Kitano Shuji... ...was stabbed to death in his Shibuya office this morning. A beautician, Kimiwada Hidemi, spoke with police at the scene... ...and was detained pending further investigation. The pages of a new Kitano book were found mutilated... ...and police theorize the murder may have been the act... ...of a deranged fan. Kuroe! Don't go! Stay with me! I can't do it alone! You're home... I was soared. Kotaro... All our friends are so nice... why don't things go well for them? Yeah... You know, I wouldn't mind dying... ...if that meant all everyone's problems... ...would disappear. What's wrong? Chicken! Then don't make me sad. Will you really be sad? That's how much I love you. Will you stay with me? Yeah. Good. What would you like to do? Shall we talk about stars? Make this a planetarium? No. I think I'd prefer a walk instead. Will you go take a walk for me? I can't see anything from here anymore. It's beautiful... It's OK. Kuroe took everyone's troubles with her when she went. Let's go. Do you want to stay at our place tonight? Thanks... ...but I'll go home. Kotaro... Look. What the hell?! They're false teeth. What a shock! Never seen them? False teeth! Do you smoke? No, I don't. Maybe I'll try. Thanks.
