[music playing] [radio static] [opera on radio] Hello, little girl. Hey, Joe, let's go. Sit down. How's your old man? My old man's got nothing to do with this. This is between you and me. The money, Nicky. Right. At least you didn't put it in a suitcase. What? No chemistry set? No scales? It's nice to be trusted. Trust is so very nice but really stupid. Kind of like you. Now just get out of here. [heavy breathing] [yells] Come on, Mannucci. All right, take it. You-- [gun shot] [opera in background] Joey! [music playing] [tires screech] [sirens blaring] [phone ringing] What? Pat, let's go. Nick. I was just telling Randy here about how you, me, your old man used to play search and destroy down at the farm. Yeah, it seems like only yesterday, don't it? You calling me at 5:30 in the morning to reminisce? NICK (ON PHONE): Hey, I'm on my way down to the farm. Meet us there. Pat. Yeah. NICK (ON PHONE): You coming or not? I got work. NICK (ON PHONE): So call in sick. It's my own business, Nick. How the hell do I call in sick to my own shop? So what's the sense of being your own boss then? Come on. It'll be fun. Call me in the morning. NICK (ON PHONE): Look, cuz, I never asked for nothing, right? So now, I'm asking you. Please? Please? Pretty please, OK? Yeah. It's real important. Nicky. NICK (ON PHONE): Quick. See you in a few. [dial tone] [music playing] PAT (VOICEOVER): I never had a kid brother. But for my ninth birthday, I got Nick. All i really wanted was a bike. We grew up on the farm together. Nick was too young to remember his dad. His mom cooked lunch at Pennsville Middle School till the day of my ninth birthday, when she dropped dead, right into the beef surprise. My folks took Nick in. The farm was-- well, it was everything, till we turned 16. Nick says the only thing that kept him in South Jersey was Salem County Juvenile Court. The only thing keeping me was Linda Graves. Nicky's like a-- like a roller coaster. You get your ups. You get your downs. And you've got no control over any part of it. Once you're on, you just cross your fingers and go for the ride. [music playing] [laughter] What the hell you doing? Research. Nameless in Fort Dix claims he got this bitch off 17 times in one afternoon. [laughs] What the hell did he do? He lied. PAT (VOICEOVER): Whatever it was Nick needed this time, I figured the longer it took him to ask, the worse it would be. Then again maybe, he just missed me. Jesus Christ. How long has your uncle been away? I don't know. A couple of days. I can't drink coffee black. I need milk. Take the car over to 7-Eleven and get some. I'll make tea. Fine. Ooh, touchy. PAT: Nicky? He's here. [music playing] So-- where's Nick? I don't know. Hey, listen to this. Sissy knees were up around her ears. And she was screaming, more, more. But then I heard her cousin behind me-- Girl's gotta catch me. Pat, Grandee. Grandee, Pat. So? What's all this about? GRANDEE: Good question. Come on. Let's take a walk. Mind if I sit this one out. [music playing] So where'd you find her? Jersey Shore. Folks got a summer place at Berkeley Point with a mansion in Princeton. I drove by it a couple times. Old man is loaded. She's a real class act. No doubt about it. Polite, articulate, or was she just looking at the pictures? I'll have you know this chick flunked out of freaking Radcliffe. It's weird thinking how someday we'll each only a piece of this place. Ah, but you'll probably live to be 150. Not that I want a piece of it. Christ, could you see me mucking all those stalls the rest of my life? Yeah, actually I can. If only he'd had better management, decent equipment-- Oh, like those amps, the ones you sold us for a little less than list price. I was kind of wondering when you were going to bring that up. Yeah, well, it was a long time ago. Yeah, but not forgotten. Come on. You must have figured they were at least lukewarm. At the time, you didn't much care where they came from. Double billed with damaged goods. Double billed with the same goddamn band you lifted him from. Those biker roadies almost broke my hands. Yeah, but they didn't. After I gave them back. I paid you back, didn't I? Half. I'm working on it. For five years? That's why I'm going to make it up to you. Come on, there's something I want to show you. What? You'll see. [bird crowing] Shit. What's the matter? You never seen money before? Smitty got lucky at the track. I doubt it. What difference does it make how I got it? It's here. It's happening. Most important, it's mine. How much? $10,000 change. I want to buy some stereo equipment. OK, OK, so I want to buy a bunch of woofers and tweeters. I want to run the money through your shop. Put it in the bank. All nice and legal. And write a check. Kind of personal loan for 95. That's 5% for you, clear, under the table. You want me to launder it. Your shop's a cash business, right? What's a few extra invoices? - Where'd it come from? - You don't need to know. You don't want to know. I don't even want to talk about this. You and your-- you and your wife got scammed. It's underlying nothing. It ain't' the way it seems. Why don't you just tell me the way it is then? Well? Pat! I shot somebody. What? This drug buy went bad. He ended up with the paper and the coke. And the guy's gun. And the guy? Well, he kind of didn't make it? Well, is he still kind of alive? Not really. It was either him or me, man. So, you going to help me or what? I don't know, Nicky. What do you mean you don't know? I'm your cousin. We were like brothers growing up. The only reason I called you in the first place was because I thought you were the only person I could trust. Now, I need this, Pat. You got to come through for me. I swear I will never ask for anything ever again. Never. Give me a little time. OK. Take all the time you need. Take the rest of your fucking life. I mean, hey, I'm only asking you for a little favor, which I would've done for you without so much as a thank you, ma'am, or reason. Why don't you just go home, Pat, hooked up a few more tape decks in the 9 to 5 and forget I ever called. Well, don't put it there for Christ's sake. What's wrong with you? What if one of Uncle Joe's buddies comes along to borrow a tool or something or a tractor? He'll get rich very quick. There's gotta be a better place. You got a key to the gun room. Come on. It's manageable. We got this. [buzzing] [moaning] There's someone at the door. Oh. Would you get it? - No. You get it. I'll get it. [buzzing] What? ALDO (ON INTERCOM): It's Aldo. I'm coming up. Yeah, come on up. - How much does Grandee know? - Not much. How much? Well, she sort of set it up. Some guy she knows from Princeton. Some college punks. Anyway, they wanted a cut. So they sort of came to me. Can always say, no, right? Someone calls me, my moose. Here we are. Nicky. What? Are you being straight with me? Yeah. Sure. Really? Straight? Medium straight. It was really weird, man. Next thing you know I got this guy's gun and I'm shooting the friggin' thing. Are you sure that you killed him? It was point blank, man. Where the fuck is he? What do you want? 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock, and I've got an appointment with the regional IR fucking S auditor and my account don't show. Now I'm supposed to explain how it is I come to spend $200,000 on entertainment and lunch. And how it is I'm driving a Thunderbird turbo coupe to and from my new condo in Weehawken when my claim net income is 15 grand. And this-- [laughs] And this guy, this functional yutz to see my books. Stunard wants to see receipts from the friggin' dry cleaner. And my representative, Mr. Joseph, P for putz, Mannucci, CP fucking ain't nowhere. So what? Do I gotta remind you that Mo I'd Rather Kill You Than Breathe Mannucci is my silent partner. Do want a cup of coffee? Coffee? Jesus Christ. Hi, Aldo. Nice tie. Uh-- hi, Beth. Nice-- robe. It's a nice robe. Hey, where you going? To get coffee. I wouldn't mind a cup of some of that coffee. BETH: Hi, Norma. It's Beth. Is Joey there? Do you know where he is? Did he say when he'd be back? You know, I even got Joey the records he wanted. BETH: OK, thanks a lot. So, you know, where he is? Hey, what do I look like to you? He's said he's going to meet me-- later. BETH: Norma said he dropped her off at her place about 2:00. She say where he went? No. What a putz. He's OK. He tries so hard to be one of the guys. I think it's pathetic. Aldo, you've know Joey since we were six years old back at St. G's. Come on. Ah, gee, Hilton, if I had known we were going on a sentimental journey, I'd have brought along another hanky. See, I got a problem with the tax man, which means Joey got a problem with me. And if he fucks me on this audit thing, I will drag his worthless guinea ass out onto the street and baby slap his face from here to Passaic. Don't you ever threaten Joey again. Especially not in my house. Hey, come on, I was just having some fun. You know me. Yeah. Nice pin. You think maybe something happened to Joey? No, I do not. Yo, Grandee. GRANDEE: Up here. Better go see. Meet you in the basement. Oh. Every friggin' mattress in this house is soft. Let's try the couch. I did. It's worse. So let's throw some blankets on the floor then. Where's Patrick? Downstairs. Pat ain't a Patrick. Pat is short for Patton. And he gets pissed off you call him Patrick. He gets pissed off if you call him Patton. So take your pick. Patton? As in General George. The guy who looks like George C Scott. The movie. What movie? Come on, Grandee, don't be dumb. What's to be dumb about? Your cousin's named after a general. Only I'm not supposed to call him by his real name or by a normal name. Anything else? Can we just split? I hate the country. Look, I still got a few details to work out with Pat. So why don't you just read, sleep, do lines or wherever it is you do. But just please don't call him-- Your cousin Patrick. He's nice. 24 hours, OK? Then you can go back to just being-- yourself. [phone rings] [beep] MOE (ON PHONE): Hilton. Hilton, I know you're there. Hilton, pick up the god damn phone. No. MOE (ON PHONE): Where the fuck is my kid, huh? Who the fuck knows where he his? MOE (ON PHONE): He supposed to be at the races a half hour ago. Look, you find Joey. You tell him to call my fucking sister, because if I got to listen to that suck my balls one more time, I'm going to come over there personally kick your ass, you stupid rat bastard. Do you hear me? Why don't you kiss my ass, Moe. MOE (ON PHONE): And another thing. Oh, why launder what's already clean? Or is there something else you neglected to tell me? Like the possibility that some of these bills may be marked? Slim possibility. Slim slim or very slim. Negligible. Look, I never even met these guys. They could anybody. I just don't want to carry around that kind of cash right now. Don't say anything to Grandee. So what if I deposit this stuff and roll three cherries in front of some DEA man. That's the beauty of it. Who knows who comes into your shop or where they get their cake? For all you know, it could be from tips down at Denny's. You got to get rid of this. Burn it. There's ammo cases under the stairs. Empty one and pack this stuff inside. You remember machine gun your dad used let us strap on? Yeah. Why? Is it still here or did he sell it? My dad never sold anything from the collection. - Can I see it? - You want to see it? Yeah, I want to see it. - You want to see it? - Yeah, can I see it? - You want to see it? - Yeah, can I see it? I wouldn't put that thing in your hands if you paid me. How much? Soon as you finish packing up that stuff, I'm gone. Why? Why? Drugs, guns, money, death, a preppy drop out who gets her giggles from all of the above, a cousin I haven't seen in five years who suddenly shows unhealthy interest in automatic weapons. Take your pick. Oh, there you are. Hi, Patrick. Name's-- uh-- Yeah, yeah. What's in the box, boys? You tell Patrick about the guy yet? Uh-- what, guy is that Grandee? The guy I thought Nicky was going to tell you about. But since he didn't, he didn't. Ciao. Perfect. I thought she didn't know about the guy. She doesn't. Who the hell is she talking about? - Another guy. - I know that. What other guy? GRANDEE: The that's coming to see us tonight. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. [music playing] Why? Hey, this is Hilton. You seen Joey? Mannucci. Who do you think? Yeah, well, if you do see him, tell him I'm down at the old station. Right. [shooting sounds] Whoa. Damn it, Nick. [groans] Medic. Medic. Can I try it? - Later. - Come on. I've never shot a machine gun. You're not going to start with this one. Why not? It's my father's. Nick had no right to even take it out. You think he's going to miss it? Put it back. No. PAT: Put it back. No. Nicky, give it to me. [siren] Shit. Let me handle this. [police radio chatter] Mal, how you doing? Pat? Come on I haven't changed that much, have I? MAL: Well-- I see you're still making Salem safe for democracy. Still a deputy too. Still doing double shifts. So what brings you all the way out here? Wilma Partlan said she saw a couple of guys up by your uncle's barn this morning. So she thought she'd give me a call. What with Joe on vacation, she thought-- Thanks. Decided to take the day off, visit the old place. With him? Haven't seen Nicky in a while. MAL: Me neither. Fortunately. Come on, Mal. The kid's older, wiser. He's different. Really. So you and Linda graves still-- uh-- Every chance I get. Mostly when the kids are asleep or when they're staying at Linda's mom's. Linda's Linda Burns now. Got two girls. That's great. Stop by the house before you go. He's staying out of trouble? Far as I know. Joe know you're here? No. We thought we'd surprise him. Take care, Pat. Yeah. What did he want? Nothing. Dumb hick. Always coming on like Wyatt Fucking Earp. How you can be friends with a guy like that is beyond me. Chasing my butt since I was 15. You were Mal's first bust and the second, third, fourth, fifth. Hell I gave the guy his frigging career. Wants and warrants on New Jersey 510 Easy Tango Freddie, over. [police radio chatter] [music playing] Why the machine gun, Nick? Deterrence. Against? Anything small and anybody dumb enough to make a move on me. Ah, Gritney, I'd like a moment alone with Nick, if you don't mind. He means private. So? Go someplace. The two us, one of you. NICK: Majority rules. Ain't democracy a bitch. This guy. Which guy? The tonight guy. Oh, him. Grandee knows him. You're expecting trouble. Ah. Once again, Nick, why the machine gun? This guy you shot, he's got friends, right? Joey Mannucci never had a friend in his life. Joey Mannucci? Of the Mannucci Mannuccis? You shot Motown Mannucci's kid? Jesus Christ, Nick. The cops will be glad he's gone. His family won't. His family won't know. It was just him and me, man. Now nobody knows but you, me and him. Now I ain't talking. You ain't talking. And Joey sure as hell ain't talking to nobody but the angels. Nobody will ever know. You think. I hope. And just in case. Well, there's always Mr. Thompson's little invention. What if he ain't dead? He had some serious shit. You shot a guy, Nicky. Forget he was a scumball. Doesn't that bother you? Yes, it bothers me. What do you think? I'm trying not to let it bother me so much I got no moves left in the case I need them. Remember how your dad taught us? Fire and move. Hit the dirt. Check your flanks. Check your back. Fire and move. Keep it moving or you die. It's how it is. I just want to dump the coke. Get my money. And run as far away as it'll take me. Mexico maybe. Or Hong Kong. You know, I always wanted to visit the Orient. Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. [music playing] Where the fuck have you been? I've been calling all over town looking for you. I've been working out with the Giants and you mother. Christ, who did this? What happened to you? - Well-- Well, what? Well, well, so me and Rover, we're out right. And we end up at this after hours place. And this punk starts talking me up right in front of her about how he wants to cop. So off hand, I say, like how much? And he says, eight. Eight what? Ounces. Ounces of what? Blow, you know, cocaine. I don't believe this. So I call Bobby V. And I tell the punk, I'll meet him and his $10,000 at that warehouse over by the center of-- You're an accountant, for Christ sakes. So Nicky-- - Nicky's the punk, right? - Right. So Nicky, the punk, who you met with-- Hey, who's telling this, you or be? So far your telling me nothing I can't see with my own two eyes. Hey. Oh, what's this? - What's what? - This. Nothing. You call getting shot no-- Ow. Man, it's my head that hurts. I must have hit it when I slipped or something. Shit, I don't know. But you had to see this kid. I mean, one look at this kid, you know he don't know that. I mean, he don't know nothing from nothing. He knew enough to bring a gun, didn't he? Well, not really. So if he didn't bring a gun, how'd you get this done? Well, there's the struggle. Well, you know, he kind of disarmed me. You took a gun to this meet? Well, I figured I could take this punk and his 10 grand out. - Off. - Off, out, whatever. So where'd you get this gun? Oh, no, Joey, please don't tell me you took your father's-- Hey, man, I like just borrowed it. Does this guy still have it? I guess so. Jesus Christ all mighty. Joey. Look, I'm a certified public accountant. I get up every day. I go to work. I add. I subtract. I figure percentages. I do a lot of nothing that nobody knows nothing about. But everybody knows Motown Mannucci. I know what my father does. I know who he does it to and when it gets done. He's all the time telling me, son, I do all this for you, all this for me. Well, I wanted to do something for me. This is bullshit. It's my turn. I wanted to kick some ass. Oh, we are dead. In between all this vicious ass kicking, oh, terrible one, let's not forget that you just got point for 10 large, eight z's, not to mention your dad's prized WWII Colt fucking 45, which we better get back, pal, or he'll kill you. Then he will kill me. My father's a reasonable man. I'm sure something can be worked out. Oh, come on, tough guy. [music playing] [bird calls] [music playing] Mrs. Partlan, how you doing? Nice little fire you got going there, Nicky. Yes, ma'am. Mal burns said it was you. I just stopped by to feed the stock, check the house. Everything OK? Couldn't be better. Don't look at me. Wilma. Pat. I asked her in for coffee. Sure. No problem. If it's a trouble-- PAT: None at all. It will defrost a whole lot quicker if you pop it in the microwave. Since when did Uncle Jo get a microwave? A couple of months ago. Here, let me show you. That's OK. We're thinking about making eggs anyway. Right, Pat? Right. Well, I guess I better be getting about my chores. Nice seeing you boys. Miss. Your microwave. [laughs] You're soaking. Really? Please, not you too. (SINGING) Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee. Welcome to Let's Make a Deal with Joey Mannucci. Take that Joey. Take that Joey. [singing opera] Shit damn. Warming up. I got Bobby V out here saying he's going to go to the old man for what he'd find Joey. I've got Aldo calling me every 15 minutes wanting me to ask Joey, how he can run off his jacuzzi as office equipment. Got Caruso in my bath tub. [horn honks] I've got a headache. There's something else you got, pal. What? You're bad, Joey. Real bad, Joey. JOEY: Yo, Beth, there's no towels in here. Give me a towel. I'm about to turn into a prune. Beth, come on. You've got work to do. Look, the kid's in a bad way. He got beat up last night. Oh, Christ. He probably deserved it. Even if he did, it's up to me to make sure it don't happen. Well, then, teach him some manners. I'm going home. Call me tomorrow. OK? JOEY: Hey, shit for brains, where's my towels? Joey. [knocking] What? Hey, what are you doing in there? Nothing. HILTON: Wash it till it's clean, OK, Joey? Hey, Hilton, come here. I got this special place that only you an wash. OK, I'm coming in to wash it now. Hey, how many times I gotta tell you, it's cold for bruises not hot? Get out of here man. Jesus, Joey, you're going to puff up like a fucking sausage. So when can I see your old man's guns? Some other time. He's got a frigging arsenal in there. He got 1940s German grenade. Too bad he ain't got a tank. Probably want to borrow that, too. Pat's dad was a tank driver under Patton during WWII, fighting Nazis, kicking ass. The stories he had. Anyway, when it ended, he saved a few souvenirs and started buying some others, like the old Thompson. Each and every one of them's got a story to go with. I think it's weird. Collecting things. NICK: Grandee's of the philosophy if you can't eat it, drink it, or screw it, or piss on it, it's no good. What's the matter, Pat? All this talk about your dad bumming you out? Hey, look, I know the guy was a little obsessive, but he earned it. I kind of envy you. You want to be in a war? I want to be in the movie, migs, mortars, choppers, lock and loaded, rock and roll. Dead, but no blood. A popcorn war. [music playing] Come on. If I ever walked up to and-- [music playing] So this Nicky kid, what do you know about him? I've seen him around. He knows you know him. Yeah, why? I just want to make sure there's nothing else tying you to this deal. Besides the debt. Besides that. Well, maybe-- Now what? Well, I wrote my name and number down on a piece of paper. And he put it in his wallet. The office number, right? Well, I assumed I'd come by here first. You gave him my number? I did. So what? Ow. You know, Joey, as a criminal, you make one hell of an accountant. You-- Hilton is a bodyguard. OK. Look, Hilton, about last night-- Yeah, yeah, I know. Just OK? [music playing] What the fuck is going on here? Ask Nick. I will, believe me. But right now, I'm asking you. If Nick wants to tell you, he will. It's not up to me. I bet that shit in the freezer is-- Is exactly what it's supposed to be. Then why is the money still here? Let's just say things didn't work out the way he planned. Nicky ripped the guy off? Now I know why he didn't stop in Princeton on the way down. That's neat. I think Nick is in some serious trouble. Nick's always in trouble. If he ain't, he'll find. It's what I like about him. Hey, at least he ain't dull. The guy Nicky ripped off is connected. So? So? No connected guy is going to go down without one of his connections coming down on whoever did him on a deal. It ain't just his deal. It's the organization's. Hey, shit happens. You just don't get it, do you? You think you're trust funds and triple last names give you some kind of immunity. Well, think again, little girl. Because shit does happen. And some of it's going to happen on. You know what I think? What? I think you're just covering for Nicky. I think Nicky's trying to rip me off is what I think. Fine. You think whatever you want to think. Only why don't you do your thinking someplace else? Like home. Hey, part of this money is mine. Look, Nicky is not ripping you off. He wouldn't do that. - Oh? And why not? Because he-- What? Loves me? Something like that? Hey, put away the Valentine and step back into the sunshine, ace. Nicky and I have some good times. When the good times end, so do we. It's simple. [piano music playing] Joey, what are trying to prove? I mean, you had it all. Rank, position, your father's respect. I mean, Jesus, Joey, I'm not just your friend. I'm here to take care of you. What are you? My mother? When I have to be. But when you go out all on your own and step on it with both feet-- and look at you. You missed at me. It's funny, Joey. What am I going to tell your father? Nothing. I gotta tell him something. Otherwise-- Look, he gets told nothing about nothing. Not the deal. Not the gun. Nothing. Especially not the gun. [crickets chirping] [clock ticking] [music playing] [dialing phone] [phone ringing] Hello. BETH (ON PHONE): Mr. Mannucci. Yeah? I'm a friend of Nicky Hardy. You put him on. I want to talk to him. I can't right now, but I just wanted to ask you if everything went the way you expected the other night. You believe this bitch? What's that? What interest is it of yours, lady? Nicky was making that purchase on my behalf. And-- JOEY (ON PHONE): Where are you calling from? South Jersey. South Jersey. Yeah, Nicky used to talk about that place all the time, down outside of-- uh-- Camden ain't it? Camden? What is that? Give it to me. Give it to me. Get off me! You want to tell him or should I? You think I'm blind? You don't think I've seen you eye balling her? And that little foot action under the table, what the fuck was that? What the fuck is this? I was fighting him off. Yeah, he dragged you in, right? Give it a rest, Grandee. [glass shatters] See this? So I took it. So what? To call. And? And? She talked to Mannucci. Even though you shot him point blank, huh? I assumed you were trying to rip somebody off. And I figured it was me. I saw the money, OK. So I called up what's his name. Joey Mannucci. What's the problem? The problem is Nicky here tried to shoot him. You tried to shoot him? I didn't try to do anything. It just kind of happened. Does he know where we are. If doesn't now, he will soon enough. South Jersey is a big place. Shut up. Come on. What? When you men figure out your next move, you just let me know. PAT: The point is we've got to find a way to somehow diffuse the situation. That's brilliant, Pat. I could've told you that. You just think Moe is going to accept an apology. Hey, gee, Moe, I'm really sorry I tried to blow your kid's brains out, but it was the end of a long day. And I was having trouble with my girl. Yeah, great. He's going to strangle me or get one of his guards to throw me off the East River. Make him a proposition. What kind of proposition? One that-- one that would be in his interest not to refuse. You offer him the money or the coke, maybe both. Probably both. Do it somewhere we can control the circumstances. How about Morris? I was thinking more of here. Uh, uh, no way. Why not? I don't want them knowing about this place. I don't want to wake up in the middle of the night with this barn burning down. That's only if we don't give him what he wants. If he thinks he took you, he might let what happened pass. The money and the coke? If we have to. What do I tell Grandee? Nothing. I'll call him up. From here on out, I do all the talking and the negotiation. When we do finally make the meet, you stay out of the way. Pat. Yeah? Why are you doing this for me? You do know that I'd do the same for you, don't you? That's the difference between us, Nicky. I'd never do anything so stupid as to have to lean on you to bail me out. If you did, you know I would. I know. Wait. What? Maybe we should just put the stuff someplace, like a locker in a bus station. Or what if-- what if we like go to a museum. We check the bag. The bag's got the coke in it. We leave the bag check someplace. They pick it up. They go to the check room, get the stuff. And we never even have to see them. Well, I thought was a pretty neat idea. It was OK. Well, it sure beats some shootout at the Old Corral. The OK Corral. The point is somebody's got to talk to Mannucci. Or else he's going to-- Look, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, the guy's a criminal. This must happen all the time in his line of work. Joey. Yo, Nicky, is that you? This is his cousin. Look, Joey-- Mr. Mannucci. This has all been a very bad mistake. I'm-- I'm-- I'm sure I'm speaking for Nicky when I say that we're all very glad that you're not-- hurt. Nicky just kind of freaked out at-- the reason why I'm calling-- how can we make this right? Mr. Mannucci? Yeah, I'm still here. What do you got in mind? We meet, face to face. We return everything that's owed to you. Everything? Everything. Where? You expect me to drive all the way down to South Fucking Jersey for a lousy-- all right, where are you? It's called the Harding Farm. It's on Salemville Road. Take the Jersey Turnpike all the way to the end. That's Exit 1. Get onto Route 49 East. Follow that through Pennsville, Harrisonville, and into Salem. There's a Texaco station and a light at the end of the town. Hang a right on Hancock Bridge Road, one mile to Lower Alloways Creek Road. Turn left, 3/4 of a mile down the road. It's the farm on the left. You got that. Yeah, right. I got a tape recorder on my left ear. Now, run it again. Slow. Here. Yeah. Yeah. Alloways what's? Road right. 3/4, on the left. Yeah, this is me again. Nicky's there or there's no deal. He'll be here. JOEY (ON PHONE): When? As soon as you can make it. Get the car. Looks like we're on. Now what? We wait. [clock ticking] [music playing] How long you figure it's going to take them? This time a night, maybe two hours. Maybe they stopped for coffee. Or a fucking bazooka. Stay calm. Oh, look who's talking. Mr. Duodenal Ulcer himself. I say we break open a war chest. Break out some heavy artillery. No. Look, you can carry the sentimentality thing too far you know. No more guns. The rifle will be plenty to cover me. You better believe Joe will be packing more than a starter's pistol. He'll be armed to the gills and his gills will have razors on them. What's the matter now? This kid's direction are-- Give me this. Go inside and ask directions. - Hey, Joe. - What? - There's a cop inside. - So? - So there's a cop-- - So what? All right. What's he going to do? Bust you for asking directions? Hey, Hilton. What? Will you get me some aspirin, please. [bell rings] Can I help you? Can you tell me how to get to the Harding Farm on Lower Always Creek Road. Alloways. You take your first left at the lights. And then you take the next left. Harding Farm's about a mile down on the left. Name's out on the box. Can't miss it. Thanks. Friends of the family? Well-- Oh. What? Joe Harding said he was selling off one of his bulls. That's right. That's why we're here. For the bull. Thanks again. Could you tell me where I might be able to get some aspirin. I got some-- in the car. - Uh-- no. Thanks again. We'll stop at a drugstore. WAITRESS: I though Joe Harding was off running somewhere in Pennsylvania. He is. Later. [music playing] [siren blaring] Has our friend left? Yeah. Let's get this done with. No. We let this cop do his local yokel thing. Then when he's forgot all about us tomorrow, then we hit the kid's farm. Maybe. This is stupid. No, what was stupid was you ever trying to do a deal, which you shouldn't have done anyway. Especially without me. That's what's stupid, Joey. All my life I've been hearing the family war stories. Me, they groomed as a freaking CPA. I know what you guys say about me behind my back. If he asks where I am, tell him I had to answer nature's call. Number one or number two? [music playing] What time does day start in the country anyway? When the sun comes up. Any more questions? Think this place has room service? [rooster crowing] [music playing] What's this? Art. Great. Are you coming or what? JOEY: Shut up. I'm combing my hair. What are you looking at? Nothing. That's what I thought, nothing. Come on, Joey. [music playing] [police radio chatter] Ran into a couple of guys in town. Said they're heading your way. Know them? It's my brother. Patrick and I are getting married. And he wanted to meet him. We haven't set a date or anything. Big step. So I guess I ought to congratulate you. Funny your brother ain't here yet. Patrick give him lousy directions. Which way are they headed? Back into Pennsville. Maybe I'll try and catch them. No. Uh-- they'll find us eventually. Right? Come here. You know, I think you're leaving something out here, Pat. If it's family, it's none of my business. Just make sure it doesn't become my business. We're cool. Ma'am. [music playing] You can let go of him now. Sure. What? This is perfect. Mannucci's been seen, right? He knows he's been seen. If he shows, there's no way he's going to do any nasty. Think about it. We just give him back the drugs. And that's that. You're right. You're absolutely right. Thank you, Mal Burns. Now, Pat, just slow down a minute. Give this some thought. This changed the whole complexion of this. In what way is that, Nicholas? Well, if I give Joey back his stash, I got nothing to give the guy. We're going to give the guy, we got to give him back his stink, which means I come out of this with nothing, nada. I'm even out the price of tolls and gas. If you're thinking what I think you're thinking-- Let me finish my deal with Mannucci. - No. - No? What do you mean no - Yeah, what do you mean no? No means no. And you stay out of this. Hey, part of the money is mine, too, you know. We have been over this and over this and over this. I'm only giving him back what he got coming, what he tried to take from me. No way I'm coming out of this with nothing to show for it. Your life ain't enough? I got my reputation to consider. Terrific, Nick. We'll have that carved on your tombstone. You said yourself, Joey can't do anything. Maybe not today. What about tomorrow? Or the next day? Or the next year? Or are you forgetting who Joey's father is? We stick to the plan. We give him back everything. The money if he wants, the drugs, anything. Uh-- excuse me, but nobody said anything about giving him back the money. I was under the impression-- See, she understands. Oh, gee. I'm not saying not to give him back his coke, Nicky. Are you listening to her? The money's good. Take it to somebody else. I mean, Mannucci ain't the only guy with a flake in New York. After all this, you're still talking deals? Jesus, what is wrong with you two? I don't get it. Why are we looking for another deal. Why not just finish the one we started? Because Joey might not be in a business-like frame of mind. I got us into this. I'll get us out. I'll deal with Mannucci myself. Just get him talking. I'll do the rest. We had a plan. Nick. Come on, you mother. [music playing] JOEY: Slow down. Slow down. HILTON: What? JOEY: Go left. HILTON: Left? JOEY: Yes, left. HILTON: Right. JOEY: There he is on the left. Nick! You the phone guy? You give lousy directions. Where's Nicky. He's out. You talk to me. I'm going to give you back your coke, and then you're going to leave. HILTON: Oh, is that a fact. the way it's going to be where does he? Look, there's no need for any of that. Yeah, right, what am I? Stupid? Your cousin tried to take a shot at me once. Do you think he gets another chance? Nicky. Yo, Nicky, we got business to discuss. NICK: I got nothing to say to you. Shit. It's a machine gun. Fucking eh, bub. Nice touch, Nick. Hey, Nick, what can I say? I tried to take you off. And you busted my face. I was wrong. What do you say we just drop this thing and start fresh? We had a deal, Joey. Don't ever say I didn't hold up my end. Here's the money. PAT: It's all here. Never even opened. NICK: Pat, what are you doing? Sorry, I'm late. Chip! Hey, I got to partying last night. And I completely forgot about-- Jokester. Who's this? Nick's buyer but at this point, who knows? Nice. Leave a little something out of the equation, Nicky. Little 45 caliber something don't belong to you. Shit, the gun. OK, forget it. You don't want to settle this now? I'm leaving. Capice? Nick, you spend the rest of your life watching your back. Get it done with. Give it back. Tell him you're sorry. Cover me. [music playing] You tell him to lower his piece. And you tell her to lower the machine gun. Look, let's just everyone chill out and lower the heat. Her first. Relax. That gun hasn't worked since 1946. But this one does. PAT: Jesus Christ, Nick, what the fuck are you doing? What I should have done the first time. I knew what you were up to Joey. A little side action. Walk on the wild side. Nobody's supposed to know but you and me. Who's going to care about some punk. Don't you think I mean it? - Just give it back. - Fuck it. Why should I? It's got sentimental value. It belongs to his daddy. Just take the bullets out and give it back. No. Just empty it. [tense music] I don't know how. [screams] [gun shot] Grandee! I just don't want anyone to get hurt. OK? The kid and me are square. He trusted me. I fucked with him. He fucked with me. Life's like that. [laughs] The tally's even. [grunts] [moans] Took the money. It ain't mine. It's his. For me? Hey. Hey, what? The case. It's got sentimental value. It belonged to his dad. I love the country, do you? The fresh clean air and everything. Shut up, Joey. Give me a lift back to Princeton? I really ought to stop in and see my folks. It's been a while Grandee. [music playing] How do I reach you? Don't. Come on, Chip. Well? You got nothing on me. Shut up. I heard a shot. Nick decided to clear the rats out of the barn. With the 30 caliber machine gun? There were a lot of rats. 22. And that? He missed. I think you better drive. Short engagement. Never would have worked. So you happy with your little adventure? What? Well, yeah, you know, I had try it. You going to do it again? Not a chance. You know, it reminds me of that Latin thing. Veni, vedi, whatever. What? You know, we came. We saw. We left. [laughing] I couldn't believe how you shot. JOEY: Oh, you're fired, man. HILTON: You can't fire me. I work for your dad. JOEY: You're fired. I don't need you. You remember the time Bob V locked me in the closet. HILTON: Yeah. And I opened the closet and let you out. JOEY: Well, so what? How about the time Danny had to kick his ass. HILTON: How about if I just kick your ass and leave you in this ditch. I'll tell Joe you stopped by. She'll be back. She forgot her purse. Where you going? To make a phone call. To who. Phone company. Why? Get a new number. Unlisted. Hey, I saved your fucking neck. We should go some place and party. With what? Commission. Ha, ha. You, idiot. So what do you got there? - I got a lot of money. - Give me some. Give you some? Yeah, give me some. PAT (VOICEOVER): Last we heard, Grandee moved to LA. No phone. No forwarding address. Moe Mannucci made page 1 of the news. The shot blew the back of his head all over the upholstery of his Lincoln. The cops found it parked in the Secaucus Meadowlands. Joey wasn't mentioned except in the obit. I opened a second store in Bergenfield. Nicky helped. It lasted almost a year. Last week I lent him two grand for a ticket. He didn't know where he was going. Mexico maybe. Or Hong Kong. Nicky always wanted to see the orient. [music playing]
