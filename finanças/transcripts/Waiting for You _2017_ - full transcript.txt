- Front, brother hold you front. Ready, fire. - War. It's bollocks. There'll be lads. Itchin' to go. Bollocks. - I expect you were like that once, Dad, eh? Up and at 'em. - Locking up now, all right? - Yeah. - Hey, you all right, Dad? You're okay. - Ruined my life. - The army. - Hate it. It ruined it. - Who do you mean, Dad? - Captain Brown. - Brown? - It's still there. In the house. - What house? What house, Dad? - Should have been mine. - It's all right, Dad. Dad. - It was still there. Could have had it, should have had it. - What are you talking about, Dad? - Sacks of pearls. From out of the sea. Dad, it's okay. - How's he doing? - He's just been trying to talk. He's worn himself out. - Why don't you take a break, yeah? - Yeah. - It's all right, darling. I'm here. That's better. ♪ Most graceful voice of God ♪ Most useful voice of God - Those of you who knew my dad well, I expect sometimes, you remember he'd speak about BJ and AJ. That's Before Janet and After Janet. And BJ included his many years in the army, of course. But Dad never said much about that. And Janet's my mom, so that definitely makes me AJ. And hardly anyone knows where Aden is anymore, but I know that my dad went there. Something to do with oil. It's the same old story. And then, he served in Northern Ireland, and in other places, too. Dad did his duty, Sergeant Ashton. And, Dad once told me that all his dreams were about the Army. But he never said what was in them. It's like some part of him stayed back there, in Aden. I think part of him died. Because my dad was not a whole person. And now, he's all gone. Thank you very much for coming. Thanks, thanks. Hey, Dave, I want you to take Mom back to the car. I'll just be a couple of minutes. - Okay, don't worry. - Thanks. Thanks for coming. Stan. - Very sorry, son, very sorry. - Thank you all for coming. - We wouldn't have missed it. Aye, good turn out. - We thought it was good, you said what you did. It was good. - I don't even know who some of these people are. - It was his way, wasn't it? - Is Captain Brown here? - No. He's not here. - Dad mentioned him when he was ill. - What did he say. - He didn't say much, didn't really make a lot of sense. - Brown was a bastard. End of story. - Aye, well, like you said in your speech, all a long time ago. We'll see you at the hotel, all right, son? - Yeah. I can't believe this, Mom. It's nothing at all. - I wanted to find out what was happening before. I couldn't make head nor tail of it. So, I had an accountant look through all this. He said the garage has been losing money for years. - Jesus. Dad was so careful. - He hid things, Paul. Now, he can't anymore. - You've got the house. - No, I'm not even sure about that. - Did Dad ever talk about anything, like a debt or something that he was owed from the Army days, maybe? - No, it was the other way around, Paul, him owing people. - If someone owed him, Mom, now would be the time to call it in. - What do you mean? Did Dad say something to you? I don't want you ferreting around. - All right, okay. - He left the Army before we met, and he never talked about it, because he didn't want to. Why are you going on about it? - I'm not going on about it. - Well you were. At the funeral. What I'm trying to say is, he made a new life. With me, and with you, his boy. - Then why be so secretive about the garage? - He was a proud man, that's why. Couldn't accept that he'd messed up. Should have sold that years ago, that's obvious, when he had the chance. He wouldn't listen. - It's all right, Mom. - I think you should have these. Add to your collection. Something might be valuable, mighn't it? - It's very nice. It's weird that he never played them. - Well, I suppose we all keep things and then forget why. You used to put all that stuff in your room about architecture and everything. - That wasn't that long ago. Seems like it sometimes. - I'm glad you're stepping up, Paul. - Night, Mom. - Night, love. - A house in France, you said? - That's what the architecture looks like, anyway. And he's with a woman. - Aye, his missus was French. - Then he went back there Aden. Aye. - Right, and he owed dad money, is that what Dad meant? - What happened was between Len and his CO. - But why now? Like it's such a big secret then. - I can't talk out of turn, I'm sorry Paul. - No, I know, but-- - That's all I know, son. - Paul. You're really just gonna take off? - Well, they weren't giving me any leave, Dave. - Can't it wait? Might not be the job you want, but it's a job. - I'm compelled. You're crazy. - Well, my mom's been left in the shit. Mom? Mom? - Have a seat The card is quite old. - The postmark on the envelope it came in says - Are you a detective, or? - No. - Yes. You see the church. It's the same. - English? - Yeah. - Bad luck. - Do you know if there's anywhere I can stay? A small hotel. - You can stay here. 30 euros. No bathroom. - With breakfast. - No, no breakfast. 6 euros for breakfast. Are you on a holiday? My father has a weekly rate. - I'll have a think. Yeah, yeah? - That looks like it's an old picture of Madame Brown. She was my piano teacher. I was no good. - Hey. Does she still live here? - Yes. She lives on the top of the hill. - Hey, are you okay? Hey, hey, are you okay? - I'm really sorry, I didn't see you. Are you sure you're okay? Do you speak English? - A little. This house, this is Captain Brown's house, is it? - Colonel Brown, yes. But he's dead. It's only Madame Brown here now. - My name's Gary Hundley. Hi. I'm a student. I'm studying architectural history. - You like the house, huh? It's full of history. Built in 60, 16, 1760. - Yes, thought it was 18th Century. - Overgrown now. - Except for the vegetables. - Yes. Those are mines. I do some work, she lends me the garden. - I'd really like to make a survey inside the house. It's for my university course. - You must ask Madame Brown. She'll be back this afternoon. 12:02 p.m. Hey, Paul, it's Dave. Your mom's been onto you, she's pretty upset. Ring me, yeah? - Dave? Hi. Oh, really? Aw, mate. Man, I'm sorry you're getting caught up in all this. It's all right. Just give me a cover story. - Yeah, but I'm doing it for her, for God's sake. Would you just see that she's okay? Would you just pop around and see her? 'Cause I've got really bad signal out here. - Okay, but you owe me, man. - Aw, thanks. You're a mate, Dave. Thank you. I appreciate it. All right, bye. - I'm researching 18th Century country architecture. - The Architectural Association. It's a very famous architectural college in London. It's Bedford Square. It's in a part of London called Bloomsbury. You can come again tomorrow. - Thank you so much. - Okay. Right. What I don't get it is, she can't be Madame Brown, can she? She's the daughter, right? - Yes, but it's a mistake that stays. I guess it's because she off in this big house on her own. - Yeah. - And also, it's a sort of respect. Everybody calls her Madame Brown. - Ah, okay. - She uses this mother's name, Madeline Cenier, when she plays concerts. - And her father, what was he like? - Oh, he was a very scary man. You must be careful. Apparently, they said he murdered people and buried them in the garden. - Yeah. So, have you always lived here, then? - Yeah, except when I'm studying. - Is that finished? - No, I hope I'll do superior studies. - Oh cool, like a post-graduate degree. - Yes. Maybe next year. Until then, I'm saving here at the cafe. - Cool. - Hey. I have something to show you. A place for you to stay. Self-contained. You can stay as long as you wish. Colonel Brown used this room to play billiards. - Ah. - Hm. Beautiful countryside, you can relax. Madame Brown hopes you will feel at home. Good? - Yeah, well, I mean, I only need to be here a day or two, so. - Now we can make the big tour. Come on. You know Aden? - Hm? - Yemen. The Colonel was there, may years ago. - Really, was he? Ah. Come and look. Oh, wow. - They say the house was given to the family by Louis XVI. You know, later, in the Revolution, he was, - Yeah. - Yeah. - Amazing. - Hm, old glass. The top thinner than the bottom. - Oh. What's in here? - It was Colonel Brown's office. His study. - I will need to survey every room. - Madame Brown will not want you to go in there. Bathroom? - Okay. - And bedrooms. Bedroom in there. - All right. - The attic in there. Careful, it's not safe in there. - Why doesn't she get it repaired? - This is the oldest part of the house. Coffee? - Ah, yes please. So, the flat, did you mean that I could just stay there for nothing? - I wish. I regret it 350 euros a week. One week minimum of course. - Right. - In advance. - Right, okay. - Convenient for you? - Yeah, yeah, it's great, because I've got the funds for the research, so it's fine. Fuck's sake. Sack of pearls. Is that it, Dad? Is that what I'm after? - Hello. Very good. How soon can you bring them? Right, good. I'll see you then. Is listening to my phone call part of your research? - Why don't you speak English to me? - I prefer to speak French. - Measuring things tells you nothing about them. I have to go out now. Ahmed will take you to the other part of the house, if you need that. - Good singing. - My father teach me songs. He died when I was little. In Aden, that place in the picture. - Sergeant L Ashton. - Gary, Gary. - Ahmed. - Come, let's have a drink. - Oh, well thank you so much. So, you say that your father, he died in Aden. - Did he die fighting, or? - No. He worked for the British. But there was a big refinery. What else can he do? He must provide for his family. I was sitting like that. An evening at the coffee table. A boy comes. People said, it was a boy you'd think was at school. He shoots my father in the head. One shot, and he's gone. - That's terrible. - Yes, terrible. But he was, you know, on the wrong side. You see? - Yeah, I do see. - Down there, grief is forbidden. Yeah. - Madame Brown's mother brings us all here. My mother, me, and my two sisters. She was a good, kind woman. My son, Hassan. Gary. - Oh my God, are you okay? Are you all healed up and everything? - Ah, yeah, bruises. You remember, someone knocked me off the bike. - Yeah. - It was him. - Yeah. - Everything is the wrong way around for him. - Maybe he's just a bad driver. - Gary is staying at Madame Brown's house. And he does research on the house. - Miss Brown, spinster. She pretends to be poor, and my dad works his balls off for her for a few dollars. You know the rumor, don't you? About her father, Colonel Brown, I mean, and his gang. - Ask anyone. Ask Sylvie. Oh, you know Sylvie, yeah? - Oh yes. She's very pretty, yeah? Shame about the boyfriend. - He's a good boy, but you know young guys now. They all get, like, a fever in the brain. - Yeah, yeah. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Gary. - I think this is good for you. - Thanks. - Jesus. - He doesn't know he pays for it. There's a party coming up. You want to come? - Yeah, okay, yeah. Thanks. Jesus Christ, Dad. - Mr. Hundley? - Are you okay? - What? - I'm going to the market. You want to come? - Yeah, yeah, okay. What's the matter? - Sylvie, I'm lying all the time. I've been lying ever since I got here. - To me? - No, actually, not to you. My father's died. - I'm sorry. - Two weeks ago. - You must be at home, why aren't you at home? - Because my dad got upset about something. My dad served in the army with Brown. I searched in the house, and I found these. These pictures of my dad, and Brown. And then, I found these. That's my dad's arm. - Was he cruel to you? - Of course he wasn't cruel to me, Sylvie, he was just a dad, okay? So, I don't know what to do with that. How do I make that fit? - He just does what he's told, a good soldier. - Sorry, I didn't mean for that to happen. - I like you. But I can think what I want about your father, my thoughts in my head. - You're still here? How come all this surveying take so long? - Well, you see, it wouldn't normally take this long, but I had to pay for a whole week's rent to use the flat, so-- - Oh no, that is just my normal minimum-- - Make a more detailed survey, because it's not just the house, it's the entire site. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Good. ♪ Sitting in the park, ♪ Waiting for you ♪ Yes, I'm sitting right here ♪ Waiting for you my dear ♪ Wondering if you're ever gonna show ♪ ♪ I don't know you don't show ♪ And my - Your Len's son. Paul. - Yeah, that's me. - Did he send you here? - Sort of, yeah. - All that rubbish about architectural research. Why didn't you tell me when you got here? That's why. - That's nothing to do with you. - I think it has a lot to do with me. - My father fell out with Len. I don't want to think about these things. It's all in the past. Gone. You've been snooping. You are disgusting. Just get out. Leave, now. - My father left my mother with nothing. You remember that, sitting in your fucking great house. - Len's died? Recently? - Yeah, he has, yeah. He's dead. - I'm sorry. There is no need for you to go. Spend a few more days here. Help me with the garden. You will stay? - I can't think how I didn't see the likeness. - Did you have an affair with my dad? - I was very young. I threw myself at him, I suppose. Perhaps I was jealous. Len was in awe of my father. In love with him. All his men were. People can be in love with somebody without sex coming into it. Don't you think? But perhaps, you don't know much about love. You're rather like Len, aren't you? - And Sergeant Ashton. Not what he wanted for his daughter? - No. When he found out, I was sent here to France, with my mother. And Len was an invalid at home. - He was ill? - He had to get out. My father was not the forgiving type. Did he ever tell you what they were doing in Aden? - No, I found out. - People think there's some kind of good war, and that's for the heroes. And then, separately, the bad things, atrocities, grotesque. But it's not like that, Paul. There is no divide. Now I know who you are. I can make you welcome. Relax, Paul. You look so tense. ♪ Sitting in the park ♪ Waiting for you - Stop, stop. I want you to tell me what happened afterwards, after the affair. - What do you mean? I've told you. I came here, and Len went to England. - Yes, but that message in the card, it wasn't your father who wrote that. - Playing the detective again? - Madeline, you wrote it. You threatened to kill my father. Why did you do that? - Oh, Paul, can we please leave all this? It's painful. Just let's, what do people say? Be in the moment. Not a bad moment. - Madeline, I want you to tell me what happened later. Because it didn't just all end in Aden, did it? - Oh. Oh, you don't remember. - Are you sure this is okay? - Sorry, Sylvie, can we just stop for a second, please? - Madame Brown, she gives you headaches. - It's not just her, it's that house. I think I've been here before. It's really weird. - Deja vu? - Yeah, deja vu. I'm sorry, you look absolutely brilliant. - Thank you. You look better than usual. - Okay. You know Ahmed's son. Yes. - Yeah. He said there's a boyfriend. - Why do you need to know? I'm here now, with you. Why ask about anything else? - Again? - So, what did your father do? - After the army? - Yeah. - He ran a garage. - And you didn't do that, help him. - No. I grew out of my love of cars when I was about six. I wanted to be an architect, and I really wanted to get into the famous architectural college in London. The Architectural Association. But the place that I ended up going to, it was just really boring, and I failed all my exams. Dropped out. And I've been working in a book shop. - That's bad? - You know, I'm not always gonna do that. I'm thinking about going back. - You must study architecture, your first love. You must. - Yeah. - My friend at university, it's sort of over. Is it okay? - Yeah, it's very okay. - Hey so, how is it with the spinster? Have you found her father's treasure? - What? - Hasn't she told you about it? Hey, take it from me, man. There's something hidden there. - Hey guys, when I was in England, I was au pair. What's that crazy game you guys play, Sylvie. - Agatha Christie. Who cares? - The game with the board, you know? But it's in the library, but is everywhere? Colonels, butlers, diamonds, jewels. - Pearls. - Sacks of pearls from out of the sea. - You could pour them all over me. - The mad colonel buries it in the garden. - There wouldn't be money in the garden, it goes moldy. - Mmm. Swiss bank, more likely. Or maybe under that seat where she sits, like a chicken on her eggs. - Carry on digging. Go on. Dig it up. - This belongs to my father. - Yes, it does. - Oh, my God. - Just lift it out. - It's a coffin. - Out of the ground. And give it to me. - Phillip. Phillipe. - My brother? Or my half-brother? - I wanted him near me. My mother bribed people. I was very ill, I couldn't have any more children. - And then, Dad brought me here. - My mother had died by then, and my father was away, as usual. And Len turned up with a beautiful little boy. Can you imagine? I'd not even known he had you. - Did he want to leave my mother? - He wanted to make everything all right again, but things can't be, can they? They can't, Paul. I went crazy, we had a fight. You were frightened and crying. You ran away, out of the house, and away. We lost you. It was terrible. But finally, your father found you. It's time to go to sleep. - Sylvie. Sylvie. Sylvie. Hey, Sylvie. I'm really sorry. - Forgot the keys. You're a shit. You leave me like I'm nothing. - I'm really sorry. - I want to see you. All those days that I see you, I like to be with you. It's just, you're somewhere else. It's not supportable, okay? - I'm sorry, I'll be better. - Please. - Madame Brown is going to Paris. - What? - Now, it's different. Not for a concert. She never comes back. And, she wants you to have this. - What, she wants me to have the house? - Yes. And, of course, you must accept. You made so many beautiful drawings. You love this house now. - Ahmed. I don't want it. Come on. - I thought Ahmed might be able to persuade you. - No, I'm like you. I want to be free of it, as well. - It's worth a lot. I mean, for your mother. - No, she'll be okay, I'll see that she is. - I'm glad you came. - So am I. - Well, of course. You've fallen in love. - I think, I think my dad wanted me to meet you. I think he wanted that. Very much. - If you change your mind, the house will still be here. - Thank you, Madeline. - Goodbye, Paul. - Thank you.
