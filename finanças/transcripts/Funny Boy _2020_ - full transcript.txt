This will encourage his girly tendency. You know the issue. Really? What issue? His talent should be developed. Actors… useless. Actors? What about Sean Connery? Peter O'Toole? The last time I checked they were actors. You know exactly what I mean. Wait… Weren't you in the same drama society in school? Shakespeare, it's a whole different thing. Some have greatness thrust upon them and some achieve it. Chelva, Radha is right. Arjie’s just creative. Artistic. Yes. He's just creative. Chelva. Arjie will be in the play. Yes! Come on. Oh goodness me, he'll be fine! One and two. One and two. And one and two. One and two. And one and two. One and two. And one and two. And one, two. And one and two. All right, stop, stop, stop, stop! Anil, look at your feet and not Radha. And again and places. And... And one and two. And one and two. One and two. And one and two. And one and two. And one and two. And one and two. One, two. Our Radha is very talented. She plays the piano so well… the famous Canadian song "Suzanne." The one about the river and the hand. Please, Amma, stop. Would you like a biscuit? Do you have any brothers or sisters? I do, I do. I have a brother and a sister. We are very happy. They make a good match. We are also happy. An accountant in our family. Mm, yes, and working for the Canadian Government no less. There's nothing so stable as a government job. A perfect couple. Rajan will be a good influence on Radha, no Amma? Yes, doesn't drink. Nor womanize. There's no insanity in our family. That's nice. Have a safe flight, Rajan! Our whole motto was to work hard, party hard. And so we would go to classes and then after that we would go to the bar and the next day we would do it all over again. And well, that was just the partying on the weekdays in Toronto. The weekends would roll around and often we'd go to Club David's, me and my gay pals. And what happens at Club David's stays at Club David's. Come on Radha, you can't just leave it there! Come on, come on let's go! All this fuss for an amateur production. Ah Rajeev, you're such a cynic! Come on, Arjie. Hi, Radha! It's going to rain. Can I give you a lift home? No, no. We are in the King and I together. I'm Anil. I know. Yes, sir? No, sir? Three bags full, sir? Please. Sure, why not. Ah, ah. Over one. This is an interesting route. Ah, it's the best route, also the shortest. It's not the shortest. But it's the best. I enjoyed those stories you told. It sounds like you had a riotously good time in Toronto. Not like us, stuck in this small pond. It's a island, not a pond. Thank you, Arjie. Welcome. And it's exotic here. Old fashioned but exotic. No Radha, I really think... Rubbish! You probably think a girl should never go to a bar. Look, I'm not the traditional type who's going to... Tradition? I certainly don't want a traditional woman with a plait down her back. I'm an admirer of Gloria Steinem you know. Honestly, you're the bloody limit. Gloria Steinem? Indeed. Royal Prince and Princesses. Arjun! Come on up. Come on. Fast. Why are you dancing around like that? Those are girly things. But I don't understand, why are girls things bad? Are you saying they're bad when girls do them too? Arjie, of course not. Only when boys do them. But how can they suddenly become bad because boys are doing them? What about Meena? She plays cricket with the boys. No one says that's bad. Just trust me on this Arjie. And why does everyone say I'm funny. What does that mean? Well Funny means… A bad man. Orre, a bad man who does bad things. Am I a bad man? Of course not. But you could be a bad man. That's why I tell you to play with the boys. Understand? But, Appa, I hate cricket, I hate cowboys. How can doing something that I hate make me good? That's just how it is. The thing is Arjie, life is full of boring people. Like, well, like your father. Yes, boring. Boring. He's my brother, so I can say it. And like so many, he's frightened of anyone who's different. But different, is wonderful. And you are different, precocious and wonderful. Am I precocious? Yes. Now, you have to find a way not to let these boring people rob you of your precociousness. It means super bright, by the way. What you've got to do is this. Stand up! Don't mess with the Grand Diva. Don't mess with the Grand Diva! Yes! Okay, ready? Step one. Okay. Step one, you're to hold this with your right hand. Okay, and then with your left index finger and your left thumb you put it in and you hold it like a catapult. Yeah, you put it in. Yeah, good. Now here comes the tricky part. Okay, you send the needle under and over to the point of the right needle. Under, over, yes! Radha Aunty, I can knit! How did you learn all this wool stuff? My grandmother. I can teach you also. Well done, Arjie. See this! Mm-hmm. You my friend are about to make something indispensable for the tropics. A woolen scarf. Hi. Arjie, hi. I thought you were going to miss it. Almost. Putting her sandal on as if he was Prince Charming. I can't believe my sister is so shameless. You have totally spoilt Radha, Amma. I'm so shocked… …so speechless. The girl is almost married. I wish you weren't dead Appa. They were just there in public. They didn't even care. He had his hands all over her! Hmm, sneaking in? Like a thief. Radha? Radha! Imagine implicating a child in all this. Well, here I am. You think this is funny? No, Amma. Okay then… Who is this boy? A boy from the play. His name? His name? Anil. Jayasinghe. Only a Sinhalese would seduce a betrothed girl. Radha, how could you? You're a traitor. A traitor to our father's memory. He was butchered by the Sinhalese, Radha. A martyr! I don't give a damn. - Radha, please. - What? So who cares if he's Sinhalese, Amma. I like him. Don't you have any shame? Behaving immorally in public… Honestly, Amma, you would think I was a prostitute or... I'm sending you to Jaffna. Our Tamil homeland will straighten you out. How could you? You think you love this boy now? Are you Radha? How can this ever work? Amma, I heard Anil with my own ears. He said he loves Radha Aunty. Who cares if he's Sinhalese? You knew all along he was Sinhalese? Aiding and abetting? Arjie, you are only eight years old, what do you know about love? Radha Aunty will never be allowed into any of our houses if she marries a Sinhalese. I’m not going. Yes you are… I'm teaching you diplomacy. Jayasinghe? Yes? - Jayasinghe? - Yeah. Anil is your son? Keep your son away from my daughter. Bloody Sinhalese in my family? Never. You Tamil bitch. What? What did you say? A bitch. You think we want a Tamil in our family? Typical Tamil arrogance. A minority with a majority complex, thinking they can have half our island. Oh, yes we will take it. Then let's see how you bloody lazy Sinhalese will survive without us. Because you speak Tamil doesn't make you smart! Sinhalese is our national language. Speak it or swim back to India! Father. We are more intelligent than you Sinhalese. You're jealous… jealous… jealous. First they rape our women, now they steal our daughters. Can I offer you a cup of tea? If you come near my daughter, I will kill you. Would you like a biscuit? Arjie? Arjie? Give this to Anil. Okay? Look after him, Arjie. Arjie. Son, Radha will be back soon. Before you know it. Travel safely, Radha. Life is so unfair. She writes to him every week. Imagine, four letters for an eight-year-old boy. More nonsense about that Sinhala boy? How would I know? Don't you read them? What kind of woman do you think I am? A nosy one. Very funny. Will Arjie be okay? He's creative. He’s creative. So childish. ♪ He has a thousand dreams that won't come true ♪ ♪ You know that he believes in them ♪ ♪ And that's enough for you ♪ She's back tomorrow. I know. ♪ You'll always go along ♪ ♪ Defend him when he's wrong ♪ ♪ And tell him when he's strong ♪ ♪ He is wonderful ♪ ♪ He'll always need your love ♪ Move, move, there's trouble. Get up… Hide anything Tamil… your jewelry. Bitch. Defending the Tamils. Come on! Come on! It's the fucking Police… Let's get out. Was Radha Aunty hurt? I don't think so. Amma. It'll be okay. Come sister, come. Stop crying. Radha Aunty. Radha Aunty. Radha Aunty. Radha. I'll kill those bastards. Anil, I can't. I just can't. Can't? Radha, that doesn't make sense. Women and children, all butchered, simply because we are Tamil. If you had only seen. Radha, please look at me. I'm not my father. But you're Sinhalese and I'm not. How can that be changed? Open the door! Jayasinghe? Open the door! Go away, you old witch. Arjie, open the door. - Hey! - Come with me. - It won't work, Anil. - Open the door! - Please. - Arjie. - Don't do this. - I love you. Please go, Radha Aunty. Please go! May the Lord in his goodness strengthens your consent, and fill you both with his blessings. What God has joined, men must not divide. Welcome to Victoria Academy, Arjun Chelvaratnam. Diggy, I won't make the team. You're such a loser, Arjie. Why did Appa send you here? Here, proceed. Your classroom, okay? Chelvaratnam. This is 12C. The Sinhala class. You want 12F for your brother, the Tamil class. No, Salgado, I want 12C. Go on in. How come you're in a Sinhala class, huh? My parents put me here to assimilate. Assimilate? We want our separate state. We want our independence. You Tamils have been whining here for the last 15 years. We don't want you here anymore. Go. Hey, Salgado. To the Tamil class... Were you born fully, or abbreviated at birth? Soyza, you better watch out. Come, don't be shy. Morning boys. Sit down. I'm Arjie. Arjun. We only use surnames here at Victoria. So, today, we're gonna read one of my favorite books, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens. Chelvaratnam. Now, when we're reading this, I want you to think about- I'm Soyza. Now the book is about London and Paris, but it can be anywhere. It can be here, it can be Sri Lanka. It can be anywhere you want it to be. It can be you in the story. Imagine that the story is happening to you, okay? Let's start. Chapter one. "Book the First, Recall to Life: The Period." "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness. It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. It was the season of light, it was the season of darkness." Another Tamil dog. Chelliah, let's get out. I say, Chelliah. Don't you know better than to use this toilet without your Tamil pals? Salgado, he's done nothing, Salgado. There are plenty of toilet stalls here but no big brother in sight, huh? Get out. Hi. Hi. Hi. Um, what's your real name? Shehan. Shehan. I'm Arjie. Yeah, I know. Right, right, of course you know. So, Shehan, that's a... it's a pretty modish name. "Matters of grave importance, it's style, not sincerity. It's the important thing." You've never heard of the esteemed Mr. Wilde? Style not sincerity! Can't run from us! Chelliah wants his Mummy! Catch the fucking Tamil! Some Sinhalese think the sun shines out their asses. You know, I'm not afraid to say it. It's at times like these I'm ashamed to be Sinhalese. Well then, I guess I... I'm ashamed to be Tamil, too. You know, our Tamil Tigers up north. So you don't hate me then for being Sinhalese? I despise you. I abhor you. Abhor? What a big word, old chap? Madam, 1.8 kilos. Don't you dare cheat me again. Madam, speak to me in Sinhala, not Tamil. Huh? Never. You’re rich. If you speak Tamil, you'll be fine, but I'm poor and stuck here. The butcher is losing his Sinhalese customers… …because he's Tamil. We are the Jews of Asia. We are the Jews of Asia. It will pass. As the economy improves, so do the differences. It's all a distraction Amma. No. it isn't. I pray to Jesus every night your hotel will be safe. You keep praying, Ma. Come on, Arjie! If they're fat and need exercise, why don't they take up jogging? Arjie, keep your eye on the ball not the girls. Chelva, stop. He means the boys, you know. Shut up you Fatty boom boom. Arjie! This boy has no hand-eye coordination. Nalini! Nalini! Akka! Once you're past the waves it's always calm, remember. Of course I remember that very original quote of yours, Jegan! Jegan's been asking about you, his favorite. I was showing him around the place. I see Chelva has given you his Bible. Hey, Diggy, Sonali, Arjie! Come here. Come. Chelva thinks that Dale Carnegie made him who he is, hey Chelva! This is Jegan. I’ve known him since he was a boy. He's Buddy's son. He's here from Jaffna to work at the resort. Hi, Jegan! You play cricket? I like Arjuna Ranatunga a lot. I love him. - I also like cricket. - Yeah? Why is Jegan really here? Tamil Tigers. He joined the Tigers? Yes, he's hardly the boy we knew. Buddy wants him away from the Tigers and the trouble they're causing. No political talk. Uh, this is... Your Appa gave me this book, it's Dale Carnegie. Hard to stay awake. Jegan, was it a long trip? About eight hours. I took the train. Is Jegan staying at staff quarters? No. In town. How long is your train ticket?

A British band. ♪ Run away, turn away ♪ ♪ Run away, turn away ♪ This Sri Lankan army has been patrolling aggressively in the North of Sri Lanka since last evening. When the Tamil Tigers took over the Kandivli railway station, and set fire to a train. The Tigers, an armed group fighting for a separate Tamil state in the North, intend such attacks as a way to bring the civil administration in the North to a halt, thus creating a defacto Tamil state. The younger Tamils feel drawn towards the Tigers, seeing them as the only protection against what they call, "States terrorism by the Sinhalese." Where have you been? I went for a film. With a friend. …their homes, businesses destroyed as well as the violence and torture used against Tamils by the armed forces. The Tamil Tigers have reacted to the massacre of Tamil civilians with attacks on Sinhalese civilians. Where are Arjie’s manners? Arjie, where'd you learn to play so well? Practiced with a friend. Chelva, look at his hand-eye coordination. Don't mess with the Grand Diva, Fatty boom boom. Come on Anna, it's Sunday, let's see a movie. No, Sonali, I'd rather meet your gorgeous cousin from Jagna. Jegan's not a cousin, he's a family friend, he's sweet. Good shot. Why so quiet, Nalini? I'm fine! - You okay, Amma? - Yes, darling. It is on the radio. Those bloody Tamils attacked our people. Oh, oh, sorry. Idiot. Arjie! Where the hell do you think you're going? To help! The minute you open your mouth, they will know you are Tamil. Come up. Now. "Those bloody Tamils." You heard that. Bloody Tigers. Who told them to fight for a Tamil homeland? I certainly didn't. Idiots… Terrorists. They're not fighting for people like us. Talking to Jegan, I see. Is that what you really believe Nalini? Tit for tat? Taking the Tigers' line? Unbelievable. I'm not taking the Tigers' line, Chelva. I'm just saying that they have a point and we can't ignore it. And you, don't you care for our people? I've hired Jegan, haven't I, Nalini? Liar! Shut up. Go tell Appa. Sir, that man is a liar, sir. He said I can't instruct the staff and that you gave those orders. Yes, son, those were my orders. The Sinhalese staff they… Sir? Look Jegan… I have given you a high position, that's why there's resentment. Because you’re Tamil and I'm Tamil. As if the Sinhalese never favor their own. Try and be more practical, Nalini. The trick is to go out there and make your money while you can, and don't step on anyone's toes. Understand? Yes, until the Sinhalese decide to take it all away… and wipe us out. Just because they can. You have a bright future ahead, don't spoil it, son. What bright future, sir? Sonali. Sit… idiot. Do you think we should talk to him? Not now. What happened to you, Nalini?
