Your father, he was released on bail, pending trial. His arraignment hearing had been set for Monday. He didn't show up. The troopers made every effort. Do you know what this is? This is very high quality. The ink color is perfect. The paper is good. The weight, watermark, plate work, it's all meticulous. There's even a metal strip embedded. In six months, he had passed almost $50,000. - He printed $50,000? - No, Ms. Vogel. He passed $50,000. He printed $22 million. He was facing a maximum of 75 years. Um, may I hold it? It's beautiful. My father... he died a hundred times poking holes in his veins, like so many rehearsals for our ultimate rejection. We get pretty good at it, don't we? It says, "Happy Highway Harry." It says, "Only three miles to make a meal outta life." My father came and went from our lives. Showing up only when he hungered for affirmation. I adored his attention, and he accommodated that. As wholeheartedly as he abandoned it. Memory reckons itself in blurs and flashes. The special moments of childhood are like fairy tales. And in mine, my father was the prince. There are plenty of ways to kill oneself. The idea is that, given the range of options, each suicide reflects the life that preceded it. If this was true, then Dad's end would be violent and spectacular. Everybody asleep around here? I'm awake. - You wanna come up here? - Yeah. Move right here. That's right. That's the gas, that's the brake, that's the shift. Those are the basics. I'll just be here if you need anything. - No! - What's up, honey? I can't... I can't reach the pedals! Sure you can. Look at how long those legs are. That's it, just keep it right there. No, Daddy, please don't leave me! Snicklefritz, you gotta learn how to drive. It's the only way you're gonna see the world. Just take care because there's a bend up here in about an hour. An hour? My mother sometimes called Dad Peter Pan, for the kind of silly charm that allowed him to make reckless, impulsive decisions look like perfect plans of action. In those times, he always wanted to make things perfect for us. Replace the humdrum of everyday life with new places and unexpected moments. He purchased the farm on a payment plan he couldn't afford. It was a dilapidated old place, but he filled it with classical music and always kept things fun for Nick and me while he and Mom fixed it up like a permanent family home. But as more delivery trucks arrived, brimming with materials purchased on IOUs that would never be met, the light fluttering music of Dad seemed to fade into a darkness. And with each layer of darkness, a new reason to disappear. - Give me my record! - No! Give me my goddamn Chopin... I will fucking break it! I'll punch your whore face, you goddamn witch! Fuck you! You're a shitty-ass husband! Dad explained his absences by claiming to be working on some mysterious business endeavor, and left Mom to pick up the pieces. She tried to find regular work, but spent most of her time staring at walls and worrying about unpaid bills. First pioneers would be in the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Bluegrass region of Kentucky. To the emptiness. Dad always seemed to call Nick and me when Mom was sleeping. His voice made me feel like part of a bigger world. A bigger world I could only dream of. Fuck. Ugh. What? We're gonna go live with Dad. Okay. You kids are like his hunting dogs. He only runs you when he feels like it. It'll be better than living with you. Nick? You, too? There are things about your father that you don't know. Like what? - When you're older... - I am older! Nick, we're leaving. Fine, fine, fine! Go! Get outta here! Oh, there's gotta be some kind of mistake, Beck! My kids are much smaller than these two. Look at that little button nose. Look at you two. Now go and get your bags from Uncle Beck's truck. I got it. I really appreciate you bringing them down. How's their mama? How do you think she is, you bastard? You left her with two kids and no dough. That was bust, I had to make a move. I see your moves, John. Man, you had a good girl and you steel-toe kicked her heart all over the street. You know what? She'll get back on her feet. In the meantime, you just take good care of her babies, okay? It's not like that. I mean, they are my babies, too. - Yeah, yeah. - See ya. I'd do anything for those kids. Yeah. Prove it. Dad! Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, my God. Dad, way too much lighter fluid! He might light the tree on fire! Boom! Oh, my... - Good Lord! - Anybody? - The "Nocturnes"! - What number? "Number 20"! See, how many kids you know know their Chopin? When can we eat? I told you ten times, it's gotta marinate. You asked for pepper steak, right? If it doesn't marinate, it's not pepper steak, it's just steak. I'll take just steak. Too late, it's marinating. Hold the thought. It's all right. Do you like music, Jennifer? Um, yeah. I like ELO. English rock, huh? Have you heard Bob Seger? I don't think so, no. What? You have to hear Bob Seger! Okay, fellas, I'll see you in a couple weeks. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey! What are you doing? - I'm changing the mood! - The mood? We're in a classics mood. We're listening to the classics. But you can't dance to Chopin. Oh, come on, old bones! I wanna play Jennifer some rock 'n' roll. Are you seriously suggesting that Bob Seger beats out Frederic Chopin, seriously? I'm just changing the tempo. Your music is for funerals. You know what? Okay. But they ain't gonna like it. These kids got class. Yeah. You wanna dance, baby? Come on, honey. Let's have a little groove. Ooh. Nick? You... You seriously like this stuff? Mm-hmm. Yeah. When I was young, I thought all the exciting things he made happen, he made happen for me. Hey, wait for me! Dad? Hello! Dad! Dad? Not enough time. Don't fuck around. I don't wanna hear that shit. - John, look at... - Hey. Hey, honey. Uh... This is my daughter Jennifer. Um, Jennifer, these are just some friends, some business colleagues from Brainerd. Everything's okay. Go on inside, I'll meet you inside. Honey, go inside. Oh, my God! Dad... Dad! Are you okay? I'm okay, honey. Daddy just bumped his face into the canoe. - Oh. Nick! - Nick! Hands up, who had a great summer? We don't want to go home. Yeah, well, something came up, Nick, you know. Well, anyway, you and I both had accidents on the same day, that's a karma thing. The next ones are always worse. Besides, you guys both got school coming up, and from what I understand, your mom is doing much better. I love you, baby. Don't you ever forget it. You and me, we got the same heart. Two peas in a pod. Come here. Hey. Hey. Would you look at that? - What is that? - You don't remember? I got a feeling I know what this is. "Happy Highway Harry." You still have that, you didn't lose it. - No, of course not. - All aboard! All right! All right, take this. Come on. They're coming, they're coming. - All right. - Thank you. - Well, this is it. - All right, Nick. You take care of your little sister. Big sister. I keep forgetting. Oh! Look at the moon. - Oh! - All right, go. Okay, go on. By the time that summer had come and gone, the bank had foreclosed on the farm. Like so many times before, all of our earthly belongings filled the old station wagon in pursuit of a fresh start. - Hi, Uncle Beck. - Hey there, guys. Mm. Come on in. Ugh! Oh, the couch stinks! You can lay on me if you want. I'm gonna leave the keys right there. Just come over here, gimme a hug goodbye. I gotta go. Give your Uncle Beck a hug goodbye, come on! - There we go. - Goodbye. - I love you guys. - I love you. - Thank you, Uncle Beck. - Mm-hmm. Thanks, Uncle Beck. Yep. Go lay down on the poop couch. I don't know between John and I who had the shittier father, but I do hope... that you pick better than my mother did on your next try. You hang in there, kid. I'll track him down, all right? And at the very least, I'll get him to mail back those... plates for your car. He hadn't paid a single bill in months. My boy Johnny is a bad penny. You never trust a bastard born on Flag Day. Because they think all immigrants are putting them out of jobs. Yeah, he just thinks that way sometimes. He thinks that way sometimes? What's so funny? You're lucky he left. When he comes crawling back to you... I come to you to borrow a few hundred bucks. Not to judge my husband. The year you got hitched, John bought the cabin at Browns Lake. You spent all summer doing it up. The day he left, it burns to the ground. Then bought the burger joint. Spent weeks making pretty, pretty tablecloths. It was pretty. But spent nothing on the kitchen. And then a hardworking Black fella opens up a better burger joint across the street, and lo and behold, John's place burns to the ground. He'd burn down the world if he thought it would put him in white mansions. - Good morning. - Morning. You sleep well? Like a baby. Did you do your homework, honey? Of course. - Good girl. - Why don't you show him? Oh, I don't need to see it. I trust my little girl, don't I? Huh? Wanna tell him I trust you? We trust each other, yeah? - Mm-hmm? - Mm-hmm. Mwah. Patty. That guy's so fucking stupid. My name is Cheryl, and I'm an alcoholic. - Hi, Cheryl. - I came here and I had... lost everything. I lost my home and my career, and my darling husband. I say that now. A year ago, I thought he was a piece of shit who dropped me by the curb, but you know something, I was so angry, and I needed someone to blame, and I could not see that it was on me. What's going on? Come on, Doc, you're in the wrong room. Oh. Come on there. Tipsy fool! Let's get you to the right one. Mom... Good morning, ladies. Now, that is the way you make coffee. All right, I'm out of here. If I'm not back for dinner, you guys start without me. What are you doing? What is that? It's resin. You want some? It's not bad. Don't push me, little lady. What are you trying to prove, Jennifer? Nothing. Hell, it's 8:55 in the morning, I'm just trying to take the edge off. You show some respect! - Why? - I'm still your mother. How long you been smoking that stuff? - Oh, please! - Answer me! Fuck you, you hypocrite! Answer me, you little slut! You big slut. Oh. You don't get to fucking hit me. Ever! I'm gonna miss you. I love you so much. Honey, we need to talk. I'm leaving. - Jennifer! - What? Don't think you're taking the car. Doc paid for that car. I don't want his fucking car. I never wanna see that sick fuck again. How dare you? After all he's done for you! And where are you gonna go, Jennifer? - You don't have anywhere - Yes, I do! Yes, I do, Mom. Oh, Jen. Jen, I may be dumb, but you're a smart girl. Don't kid yourself. Like I'm passing up a great gig here? There are things about your father that you don't know. Oh, God, here we go again, are you kidding me? Are you kidding? It's not that he's a con man - or a swindler. - Mom, this is your shit! It's nothing to do with my relationship with him! ...he believes his own lies! Okay, let's talk about believing your own lies, shall we? Let's talk about protecting your children! It's your one fucking job to protect me! Listen to me, your father is a liar. - He's a liar. - Shut up! Please, shut up! Look, I know what I am, he doesn't. And if you're gonna go with him, pretty soon, you won't either. - You won't. - I'm done. I'm done. I'm done! I'm done! Your father... Your father is a liar. Get off me! I can't do this anymore! Stop! Stop! - Don't touch me! - Listen to me, Jennifer! He looks you square in the eyes and he shows you his heart, - and it is a lie! - Get out of my way! Get the fuck out of my way! Jennifer! Who's there? Dad, it's Jennifer. Jennifer? Yeah. Can you... Can you open the door? Jennifer? So... - how's school? - It's okay. Any thoughts about college? I guess you got time. Actually, I want to study journalism. Journalism? What kind of journalism? Investigative, maybe. I like that. I can see my snicklefritz taking on the titans of industries, a fast-food chain, motherfuckers. Just a bunch of crumbs bound together by dough, right? Dad, what do you do? What do you mean, what do I do? I mean, for a living. What do you do for a living? You know what I do for living. I'm an entrepreneur. My skill is opportunities. Like what? For instance, right now, I got a whole raft of businesses. I'm working a very broad portfolio. And when you work it that way, you're not depending on one business to be your bread and butter, you know? Yield goes down on one, pops up on another. And the good news is, that I'm doing really great with that. What's that? I'm moving out of Mom's. I can't stand it there anymore. Sorry. It's okay, babe. It's okay. What's the problem, Jennifer? Are you mixed up in drugs? No? So, what's the problem? I just gotta get out. I thought maybe I could come live with you. That kind of comes out of the blue. Some things in life are about timing. Timing, you see. See, uh, right now, I'm growing the business. Businesses. And it takes all the time God sends. I've just got a lot of... Yeah, I understand. It's... But I gotta keep the plates spinning. I gotta keep the balls in the air. It's okay, Dad. It's really... It's fine. I just want a fresh start, you know? Dad, I lied. In Sheboygan, I did a lot of drugs. I smoked weed, I did a lot of speed. Coke. I just did stupid things, you know? I'm angry at you. You're smarter than that. Don't think I couldn't tell. It's not my first rodeo. Have you done drugs? Never! Oh. Uh, in some medical circles, alcohol is classed a drug, so is tobacco. So, I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that I've never enjoyed a vodka gimlet on a Sunday afternoon. And, oh, what's this? Exhibit A, methinks. So, yes. But no, I've never done drugs. Narcotics... Are you kidding me? At the cabin, you had those plants in the cupboard. I used to sit up 8at night and see you and Debbie roll joint after joint. And I also saw you doing lines. I found coke in your drawer. Don't change the subject. I'm not changing the subject, I saw you. And how old were you? How could you possibly remember? I remember. I saw it, Dad. - You didn't. - Yes, I did. - You didn't. - I did. - You didn't. You didn't. - Yes, I did. I did. You didn't. You done? - Am I done? - With your food? - Yeah. - All right, let's go. Can I drive? Since when do you know how to drive? Since I was 11. Someone told me it was the only way to see the world. Remember? Must have been a pretty smart someone. Here. God damn it! Can we finish our conversation? Jennifer, whatever it was that you think you saw, or you saw, or you think you're alleging... Dad, I just think we should be straight with each other. We should tell each other the truth. I told you the truth. Okay. I've got some problems. Not drug problems. Not drugs. Um, business. And I owe some people some money, some big mistakes I made. Thank you for telling me. I don't want to be a burden. It's not a burden. Like I've been saying, it's a fresh start. Let's get you whipped into shape. No more darkness! - Whoa! Whoa, Jen! - No more hiding - from beautiful things. - Whoa, whoa! You know, Dad, these people you owe money to, Dad, you can just tell them you're getting a new job. A fresh start. "Age 39. Administration. Advertising." "Appraising. Apartment Building. Architect. Artist. Art Supply salesman. Antique trader. Applicator." Those are just the As. You're not 39, Dad. Well, I shaved a couple years off. I thought we were being honest. Also, you're listing way too many areas of expertise. It's a resume, Jennifer. They expect you to lie on a resume. Everybody lies on a resume, they factor it in. Oh, don't go too short on the top, it makes me look beak-ish. All right now, the pay is okay slash not great. It's $2.50 an hour, raise up to $3.50 after the first six months. That's great. It works for me. Sir, hi. Can I have a moment of your time? Okay. Hello. Hi. My name's Jennifer. Okay. - Great. - Yeah, absolutely. Thank you for supporting such a great cause, that's awesome. Excuse me. Excuse me. I got a job. - You did? - Yeah. You're looking at the new executive manager for Sailfeather Floatplanes. - Dad, that's fantastic. - Yeah. Well, it's a long way out of town. A managerial position, sure. And they made me lay out for a fancy new briefcase. But it's a job. We should celebrate. Yeah. There's a sensitive topic I've got to raise. I come home from work and I have a little stress. And I wind down... We've covered this. I keep a little Thai stick in that carved canoe on my dresser. And I went to my little carved canoe... Jennifer, have you touched my stash? - Yes. - Yes? I'm sorry, I didn't think you would notice. Okay, calling a house meeting. Rule number one, you stay away from my stash. Agreed? - Agreed. - Rule number two, you can smoke, but do it behind my back. Or we could smoke together? Don't you understand the concept of boundaries? Look, Jennifer, don't disappoint me. I'm off having to be the boss of many men in the bureaucratic world all day. I get home, I wanna know I've got my weed. Agreed? Agreed. Okay, this one's not a rule, but just consider changing your hair color back. Goodnight, darling, I'm going to bed. Nick wrote me. You're drawing? You bought yourself a car? Something like that, I dropped 400 bucks to see how long it'll last. How was work? You're home kinda early. You know, I wanna show you something. Sit yourself down. What's that? Uh... It's a jean stretcher. It makes jeans longer. - Really? - Yeah. Well, you know how my jeans are always too short, but they're fine when I buy them. It's just when I put them in the wash, they shrink, and millions of people have that problem. Observe. See how that works? See? $12.95 for one and $25 for two. - That sound fair to you? - Sure. Let me show you the art. It's for the ad. I've already paid for it to run in the paper next week, but I've gotta check my pennies in the piggy. It's great. It's a great thing to have alongside the day job. Exactly, snicklefritz. It just, it goes along with the whole big raft. Now, don't go anywhere, there's a lot more I wanna tell ya. I had a couple of other opportunities. I got offered a couple other jobs, even better money, but they're all labor. I could never do that. In the workplace, I'm strictly a suit-and-tie man. My father's misguided sense of pride seemed so endlessly wed to his own shame and disappointment. For Dad, Flag Day was all of America celebrating his birthday. He believed he was owed that much, that it was the least his country should do for him. We've done our cost benefit analysis. We've decided to cancel the ad. What? No, that's bullshit! Are you trying to bilk me out of 16 fucking dollars? I'm gonna have the president of Vogel Products call you right back! You dog-fuckers. May you all die screaming in fucking cancer! You motherfucking bastards! "Through the years, long and wearing, with you my dreams I will be sharing. I understand your pain and know in my heart that we're the same. In whatever you choose to endeavor, I will support you forever and ever. Love, Jennifer." Where are my goddamn cigarettes? Oh, there. God. Look what you've done to me. You gonna make a wish? Don't move. I'll be right back. I drove by your work today, Dad. You should be proud. You're doing honest work. Open it. Oh, God. Damn it. You idiot. - Do you remember that? - Yeah. You told me to describe the cowboy while you sketched with your back to him. You said that if you describe something well enough, anyone can see it. Sorry about... - It's okay, Dad. - No, it's not okay. It's not okay. It's not okay. I appreciate... so much. What you did, I mean, all of this that you did for me. It's... And I just so want you to know... ...for you, baby, I'd climb any mountain. And no matter what happens, I'm gonna be there. No matter. The whole fucking world could explode and I will be here for you. I know. Do ya? Yes, Dad. Thank God. Oh, my darling baby girl. Things are really good here, Nick. Dad seems to actually be changing. He's been more honest with me and is finally even willing to work a regular boring job for a living. Please, please, write me back. Love, Jen. You... You colored your hair. I colored my hair? I haven't changed my clothes in three fucking days because the cops wouldn't let me back in the house. Can I... Can I get a cigarette, man? Here you go. Thank you. I was reading recently in Reader's Digest... about the power of the subconscious mind and how our actions are not consciously willed, but are what our inner beings secretly divine for us. Some people think it's the gods. I think you make your bed, or your mind makes your bed. What's that on your forehead? - What is that? - Nothing. Nothing. What do you mean it's nothing? I see it, it's right there. Well, I cut myself. What are you talking about? - It's not even a cut. - Yeah. What is it? What happened? - Jennifer... - It's red raw, it's a huge welt! Dad, this is important. When did you decide to do this? Jen, I... Listen. I've been asked a lot of questions lately and I'm a little... - Shut up! - I've been getting asked a lot of questions lately, Jen! Then answer mine! - Hey, cool it! - It's okay. I'm a little tired. Oh. You're tired? You're tired? Are you fucking kidding me? Okay, okay. Come on. It's okay, it's okay! - Are you fucking kidding me? - No, no, no, no! - Come on, baby! - That's it. Just one more second, I promise. Answer the fucking question, just tell me the truth! You're only interested in what the cops' story is. You don't even wanna hear mine. - Dad... - I'm guilty until proven innocent. I don't have any rights, do I? Do I? Do I? I've got a cop standing right here. - I've been in a fucking... - They caught you - with the money in the car. - Huh? You had a gun, you have a fucking huge welt - where you glued on a wig! - I... Look, you know, I'm at a disadvantage. I can't see what you're talking about. My God. I need to know when you decided to do this. I'm not lying to you, Jennifer. It... It just is more complicated - than that, come on. - So, you're innocent? You don't... You don't get it yet, you're gonna get it when you walk a mile in my shoes. You're gonna understand, trust me. You're gonna understand one day when you walk a mile... You will never fucking change! - Jen! Jen! - Come on, that's enough. - Up. Come on, let's go. - Okay, wait, okay. Fuck, man! God, fuck, man. Come on! Fuck. Come on, come on, come on. God fucking damn it! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! Dad was originally sentenced to 15 years. He wrote letters I didn't receive. I was never in one place long enough, and left no forwarding addresses. He wanted so badly to make his mark, and in his way, he did. He left a trail of failed schemes, squandered money, and broken hearts. Now, my abiding concern was who I would become and whether I myself wanted to matter at all. I used to tell myself, "Patty, you never saw a three-story building before you met John Vogel. You were young and he was a tidal wave." But the truth is... I wasn't that young. And there is no justifying any of it. You and Nick deserved more from me. - Mom. - Don't. How are you for money? It's kind of tight, but I'm gonna look for something in Minneapolis. Mom? I got your juice. Mom? Hey, baby brother. You got me my favorite cookies. Yes! God, I can't believe you. Oh! It's so beautiful! Look at that! Oh, babe, I gotta get off the phone, though, 'cause my sister's cab is about to be here. Okay. All right, I love you, too. Just... Just take it, baby. It's what I can afford. It should help get you started. Mom, this is too much. It's... Take it. Thank you. Really, thank you so much. Why do you want to be a journalist? Well, I think this country has a fine tradition in journalism, and I truly believe I have something to offer in the field. Personally, I think this country has a need for a deeper understanding on a wide variety of issues, both on a local and global scale. You submitted three excellent sample articles. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So, why did you lie on your application? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Your references don't pan out. We contacted your high school in Sheboygan. You dropped out with Fs and Ds. Sorry, there's... There's been a mistake. Miss Vogel, there is no one by the name of John Vogel working for JK Lowe Insurance in Seattle. - I'm not lying! - You can't BS your way into the University of Minnesota. Who's that? You're right. My dad's a bank robber. He's spending 15 years in an Arizona federal penitentiary, and I flunked out of school. Sorry for wasting your time. Hold it, Jennifer. Your sample articles, you did write those. Seems to me that a person who really wants to be a journalist has to have an awfully strong motivation to find the truth in things. Why do you want to be a journalist? I want to matter. Dear Jennifer, wow! Nick tells me you really impressed somebody over there at the University of Minnesota. Hmm. My snicklefritz. I always knew you were gonna be something very special. Hi, Jen. In places like this, the world seems to forget we ever existed. It's as if we're all just ghosts evaporating from the Earth. Hi, me again. I'm told congratulations are in order. Seems your temp job has led your editor to give you a shot at writing. Well, I'm super proud of you, my little girl. Hi, number one. I guess you're either not receiving or just not reading my letters. I sure wish you'd write me back. Excuse me. What's the time? Between writing you letters and working in the prison print shop, I keep myself busy. I think because I sketch pretty well, I'm good at it. Maybe I can add graphic designer to my resume. Ha-ha. It's cold here, so it must be freezing where you are. Boy, once I get out, I'm never ever coming back to prison again. Jennifer Vogel. University graduate. I'm sure sorry I missed it, honey. If I could have broken out of here, I'd have been there. I wanna thank all of you for being here today, all of you who spoke, all of you who have been friends of mine for so many years. All of you who have given me your support... Wow! Do me a favor. Wanna read back that last part for me? "It's risky and sensationalist, it's also true." "We back up the court files with interviews from lawyers, investigators, and scientists. More importantly, they're poisoning the water." "Poisoning the water." Yes. Yes. But all these things are true, and it's our job to write about it. So, take "yes" for an answer. You're not worried about backlash from Brentax? No! If there's backlash, I'll blame the whole thing on who? - Fucking Vogel. - Fucking Vogel. I survived this business pretty well playing good cop. Well, I'll be twirling my moustache. Hi. Is that you, number one? You're... You're all grown up. You look terrific. You look just terrific. When did you get out? I was just wondering if... maybe you could pull away for an hour, come have lunch with me? Um... I mean, not if it's bad timing. No, it's fine, I can get an early lunch. Let me just grab my purse. Oh, I've got money. I'm okay, I'm okay. - I mean, I just... - Okay. Oh, sure. Sure, I'll wait here. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Dad... I didn't know you were getting out. Did you tell anyone? Did anybody pick you up? The truth is, I've actually been out for a while. How long? A year and a bit. A year and a bit? What the hell? You don't call or write and you've been out a year and a bit? I wrote you a hundred times from prison. I didn't hear anything back. No response, nothing. Why would I think anything would change when I got out here? Did you even read any of my letters? I was kind of on the road for a while. I got 'em when I got back, and I read some of them. I just... What have you been doing for over a year? Well, I got a... I got a business. A little, uh, print and copy business down at Center City. It's called Center City Print & Copy. Catchy, huh? - A print shop? - Yep. How did you afford that? I wouldn't go too far there. I mean, it was only a couple thousand down. Previous owner had bad business sense and terminal cancer. It's a tiny business, but I do have one account. One client that's, you know, a pretty big deal, that covers me all right. In fact, I was able, recently, to do something I've been dreaming about for... a long time. What? I took a one-month rental... of a cabin up at the lake where we spent that summer. Mm-hmm. And matter of fact, I was thinking of going out there this weekend, just for a day. I don't have a lot of time, parole and all that, so I'd like to make the time special if I'm gonna spend time there. I thought maybe you and I'd go open her up. Barbecue, take the boat out on the lake. Um, I don't think I can. Well, hey, let's see... How about this following weekend, what's that, uh... - That's the, uh... - I have to work next weekend. Hey, how about the weekend after that? That'd be the 30th. I don't know, I have to check. Okay, well, why don't you check, and if you can't make it, we can do it the weekend after that. I'm pretty flexible. Here. This is it. Chez moi. It's not that bad. I'll be getting out in a few weeks. I just don't know if I'm ready for any of this, Dad. It's a lot. So, you have my number. I do. I do. So, you'll let me know if you change your mind. Come by. - Yeah. - And I'm flexible. You know, I could do pretty much any time you want. Um... Well, I, uh... I'm just so proud of you, it felt... it was so great to see you. I mean, all that you've achieved. I guess what remains to be said, and I hope you believe this... is that... people do change. ...Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee... Jennifer, call me when you get a chance, will you, please, honey? Hi, it's me. Please call. Jen, please call. Jennifer, it's dad. Please pick up. Hi, kid, it's Dad. Can you please pick up? Hey, Jen. I know you're busy. Just wanted to remind you that there's a beautiful lake one phone call away. Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming. Look at that. You've got a, a delicate kind of beauty. You got delicate features, like I did when I was your age. Your nose, your eyes, and I see that little gap closed twixt your teeth. When you're older, you'll have a more unusual beauty. People gotta look real hard to see it, but if they look, they'll see it, 'cause it's there. I think the greatest hope a man can have is to leave something beautiful behind. Something that he made. I am so damn happy you came out here. Jennifer... I want to apologize. I had a long time to... to reflect on my mistakes. I've mulled it... and weighed my responsibilities, and I want to apologize... for what happened. You know, all of it. The other day, when you dropped me at the halfway house, I was watching you drive away and I thought to myself, "What can I do to help? What can you do, John, to give her something real, something practical?" So, last Tuesday, right after we met, I called a dealer I know and I put a $5,000 deposit down on a 1989 XJS Jaguar, flamenco red, biscuit leather interior and top. I mean, it's a stunner and drives like new. What are you talking about, Dad? You've had all this time and this is how you're talking? - It's a fantasy. - Oh, is that so? - Says who? - I don't want a Jaguar. - You don't want a Jaguar? - It's a fantasy. It's a fucked-up fantasy. Does a $5,000 deposit sound like a fantasy to you? - I just wanna go back in. - Jen. - Just take me back in. - I... I need... - I need you to believe in me. - Dad! We got so far to go, Jen! I just wanna go back. I'm cold. What did I say? What happened? I'm cold, just take me back in. Here. Here. Take my jacket. - I don't want your jacket. - Just take my jacket. I just wanna go back in. - I don't want it. - Take my jacket. I don't want your fucking jacket! Ah, Mr. Sullivan. Yes. This is John Vogel. I'm the one that put down the deposit on the flamenco red 1989 Jaguar XJS, biscuit leather interior and top. Exactly. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, we're not gonna be able to proceed. Uh-huh. No, I'm aware. See, the thing is, it's that the car was for my daughter, and, uh, she changed her mind. She doesn't like the car. Yeah. No. Anyway, yeah, well, it's a long story, but I think we need to talk about the $5,000 deposit. I understand your policy, sir, but you gotta have some flexibility here. Well, for instance, how about, um, you know, 50% back on the deposit. Dad. Okay, how about 40%? 40%. You keep $3,000. Dad! Fuck! I have to put you on hold for a second. - I'll call you straight back. - Oh, my God. Jennifer! Jennifer! Hi, Jen, it's Dad. Can you please pick up? Jen, I gotta catch up on a load of work at the shop, and then I gotta leave town for a little bit, so please call me. Two years ago, a group of school kids from Minnesota Country School went on a field trip to study pond life on a farm in Le Sueur County, a farm that backs on to the Lyle-Hasco plant. This is what they found. Miss Vogel, how much do you know about pesticides? How much study have you devoted to the field? One, two nights up drinking coffee? Perhaps you even went to a library. The building I work in, Lyle-Hasco HQ, is a two-story, big, flat building. And on one of those floors is guys in white coats, and the other is lawyers. Can you guess which one I'm on? A school field trip? And you let me be clear, if Hippie Papers prints one more of this unsubstantiated garbage, we will sue you all the way back to Haight-Ashbury. I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not a scientist, but Dr. Lee Nobles from Minnesota State University is, and is the leading proponent of amphibian research in the United States. He's also a part of the team investigating Brentax. It's a two-year study, and he's publishing his findings this week. If Brentax is in the water, then that's the water Minnesotans drink, give to their children, take baths in, make coffee with. I just wondered if you cared to comment. Excuse me. We interrupt the broadcast with breaking news. We join now in progress Team Three's eye-in-the-sky reporter, Margaret Deneb, who is above a high-speed police pursuit in the Corrigan Lake Community. We go to you, Margaret. This morning, the U.S. Marshals executed a warrant at a print and copy business in Center City just outside of Minneapolis. Convicted felon, John Vogel, is alleged to have been using the storefront for a major counterfeiting operation... Dad. Dad. I am sorry for your loss. The death of a father drags you to a secret place. It trivializes everyday matters. Displaces. You feel abandoned by the living. And a kinship with the dead. Dad had been so skilled at sounding those finely tuned notes of sorrow and releasing them at the perfect moment to achieve impact. My father lusted after freedom. The kind of freedom most free people never experience. In the end, he got that freedom and gave me mine in return.
