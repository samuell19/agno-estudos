My name is Tade Kalejaye. This is my best friend Lottie, she's amazing. This is my other best friend Cheta, he's so sweet. I've known that he has always liked me for a while, but I pretended I didn't know because I didn't want to lose my friend. It was three of us against the world. Everything was fine until five years ago, I fell in love with his brother, Chidi. This marriage is gonna last till the end of time. And because I'm gon' be at the wedding and I'm going to spray, …this marriage is gon' to be rich, - till the end of time. - Thank you so much. - Amen! Cheers. - Yeah. Thank you so much, I'm grateful. - Eh-eh, couple, couple goals! - So I'll give you a call tomorrow. Yeah. Yes. Alright, thank you. You left before I finished my toast. Because you made it all about yourself and I really don't care about you like that. Aw, come on. It's their wedding engagement but it's still my party. Eh, then please, kindly go back and enjoy your party. - See. - What? - Look, can you see? - What's that? I can't see anything. In the near future, I take you out to dinner. Wow, Chidi. No, I think I'll pass. I don't want to hear you talk about yourself a bit more. Mm-mm. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm sure. You haven't heard anything. Truth is, by the time I finish telling you about me, you would agree that I'm the most interesting person you'll come across in two lifetimes. Wait, sorry, hold on, Chidi. I just realized what you're trying to do. Does it work for you with women? Cause it's not working for me at all. - This? - Yeah, this. Well, one thing I know for sure is that women find me very charming. Chidi, women find you rich. You're rich. That's the only reason why they talk to you. - Rich? - Yes. Okay, so let me spend some of that revenue on you. Um… Well… you just had to make it more corny, didn't you? You left me no choice. You have that effect on me. I haven't agreed to dinner with you. I think I wanna go back into… - We should go back? - Yeah. Hey, girl, hi, guys. Hey, Cheta, hi, Lottie. This one you're blushing. I told her some truths. - You're tickling me. - I didn't tickle you yet. - Come on. - No, I already ate too much. And then if I eat like, how am I going… You should watch what I want to feed you with tonight in my bed. Oh stop, Chidi. Um, Cheta? Hey! Bro, the spare key is for emergencies. What's the emergency? Well, dad actually asked me to come fetch you. He wants to see you now. - You could have called. - I called. But you didn't pick your phone. So I came to fetch you. What does he want to see me for? I don't know. - Babe, let me rush and see the old man. - Okay. - I'll be back soon, okay? Alright? - No problem, take your time. Yeah. - Wait for me under the duvet. - I'll… I'll wait for you. Gimme that forehead. Come on. - See you soon, eh? Okay? Alright. - Alright, see you. Cheta, make her something to eat, eh? I'm coming. - Cheta, I was going to tell you. - No, you weren't. Well, welcome back home. Do you like? - I love. - Hmm? - Tade, we need to talk. - Babe, now? Come on. - Tade! - What? What's wrong? My father. Babe, you want to talk about your father now? When I look like this. Hold on. You're looking at the next Commissioner for Finance in Anambra State. - Oh my goodness, babe. - The swearing-in is next week. Congratulations. Babe, I'm so happy for you. I'm so so so happy for you. What's wrong? Babe. Talk to me. - My father. - Mm-hm? He says that if I want to be Governor in the next four years, that I can't marry… That we can't be together. He says that as it is, I'm already too foreign. So marrying someone who… doesn't have… political skills will further alienate me from the grassroots. And we need them for me to become Governor. Who cares about what he has to say, right? Like, we don't care, right? You do. Tade, wait. Calm down. Wait, come on. I'm actually doing this for us. I'm doing it for you. Being a political wife is like a full-time job, you know? - Huh. - Being First Lady is no joke, trust me. What's going to happen to your entire career? Chidi, cut the crap! This has nothing to do with me or your father. It has everything to do with you. You and your selfish ambition. - Chidi, just leave. Go! - It's not like that. Listen. Tade, listen. I want to marry you. - But you see, for me to become Governor… - Yeah, for you. I need to connect with the people. Just give me time. Let me worm my way into the hearts of the constituents, -the grassroots, and I promise you, -Yeah. If they love me, they would love who I love. - Just give me one year to figure this out. - Wow. You're so selfish. Just one year. I'll be on the field working, you know, perfecting everything. We can go through this together. We can. Chidi, leave. Just go. - Tade, I can make... - Chidi, leave! Leave! What is it? Leave the house! - Are you really asking me to leave? - Yes. Now. Go. It's my house. I can't believe he chose his career over me. I should have known better. But what is that saying, "What doesn't kill makes you stronger" I got stronger, I focused on me. I spent the next five years building my fashion business with Lottie, Dawn by Talo. Everything was fine, until my life changed again. Nice. Okay, it's coming out nicely. - Madam, there's nothing more to add. - See. - I didn't see anything. - It actually looks better without the hat. - Yeah. - Yes, it's pretty. - Wow, this fabric is so nice. - I know. Sourcing it was stressful. - Wow. - You look good, girl. - Okay. Strike those poses. Alright. - You can go. Mm-mm. - It's lovely. What? - Oh my God! - My goodness. - What the hell? What happened? - He spilled the drink on me. - Go away with this thing. What am I going to do now? What kind of nonsense is this now? Calm down, Tade. How much longer is this show? Wait, what are you doing? Calm down. - Wow. Eh? - Lottie, gimme your scarf. - What? - Gimme your scarf. Okay. Wow. You see? I told you everything will be okay. Now it looks like a two-in-one. Not my vision, but it works. Absolutely works. Okay, chest up. - Yeah. Move. - Alright. So strut. - Wow! See the way it came out. - Everybody, come. Yes. - Beautiful. - Wow, this fabric is nice. - I know. I'm happy. - Nice! - We tried. - Let's go. Thank you. Thank you so much, Veronica. I'm looking forward to your Battle of the Brands Collection. Okay. I expect you to win and join the Universe Global Initiative. We need a talent like you. Keep it up. - Good work. - Thank you so much, Veronica. Thank you. - Did you hear her? We've won. - I heard her. - She said she hopes that we will win. - We are going to win. - If we win. - We will win. And when we win, you'll follow me on stage since you refused to follow me on stage this night. I will. - What are we winning? - Cheta, honey! Hey, Sugar Daddy. Do you want some sugar? Uh, Chief, the women were the hostesses at the recent Anambra Ward Congress. Planted to discredit my son? Yes, Chief. That was our belief. You allow yourself to be trapped, like a child. - Many have done worse. - Listen Chief, your son has been presented as the integrity candidate. The support of the Archbishop was key. - The Archbishop has seen the video? - He sent it to the Presidency. - Thank you for coming, Tanko. - It's a pleasure. Everything we worked for, you risked with your indiscipline! Get out. Look, if all it takes is just winning, you guys are gonna win. We got it. Of course you're gonna win. They're amazing. Are you joking? - Hello, my beautiful in-law, Sope. - Hi! Have I told thank you for this amazing show that you put up for us today? Thank you so much. You've told me about a million times, but tell me a million more. And you're welcome, darling. - You girls were amazing. I'm so proud. - Thank you. - Let's go now. - Darling... Hello, Brother. Did you enjoy your sister's fashion show? To be honest, I've seen better. Ah! And frankly, I expected better, given the 50 million that Kale Group gave you to sponsor your hobby. Like I always tell my followers, right? I say, "Maximize your opportunities." Please, thank God I'm not part of your stupid, gullible followers. - Daddy! - My daughter. - How are you? I must say that… - Hey, Mama! - That was an… an amazing show. - Thank you, Dad. - Your best yet. - Thank you. See, I'm so glad to be associated with this kind of event. - Thank you, Dad. - Congratulations. Thank you so much, Papa. - Well done, Tade. - Thank you mom. - The pieces were beautiful. - Thank you, Mama. - Thank you, Auntie. - Hey, what's up? You like my language? - Makes me feel like you're young, sir. - Ah! - Anyway, how are you? - I'm fine, thank you sir. - I saw your dad yesterday. - Yes, sir. I must say that we are so proud of Chidi. So tell me, how do you feel… being the brother to the next Governor of Anambra State? I'm 100% sure he has his contracts lined up. He already knows what he wants to do, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, quite, quite. But see, life is not about contracts. - See, life is about... - Um, Adeolu, we need to go. We have the profile tomorrow, remember? - Don't you be late. - Mommy, I won't be late. - Bye! - Enjoy yourselves. - Mama, did you enjoy the show? - I did, very well. - Aw, thank you. - Well done, Tade. - Bye! - Thank you, Auntie. See you at home. -So, -What next? - Are you coming to the after-party? - Wait, but I thought this… Wow, Cheta. This is the party. There is an after-party. It's 2:00 a.m. I'm sure she was working on that dress. - I'm very sure. - What dress? The last piece for the Battle of the Brands. She's been working on that dress for months now. - Hey, hi! - Hey. Shake that sweet ass, baby. Whoo! What the fuck! It's your mother that will shake her sweet ass. What's that? - I don't understand. - Were you just talking to me right now? - Who the fuck are you? - I mean, you don't know who I am? - Who are you? - I'm Kels, baby. - Who cares? - Oh, you don't know Kels? - Okay, let me slap you now... - I will slap you back. You know what? Fuck off, bitch. Me, bitch? Ahn-ahn! - Um, back to... - Recording. He wants to slap me. No, slap me now. - Um, are you not Kels the rapper? - Yes, I am. So how would you feel if I posted this video on social media? - Wouldn't... - Ruin your career? Please, why not? - Why not? Yeah. - Talk! Please, my girlfriend is currently pregnant. Oh, you have a pregnant girlfriend. Does she know where you are? - Does she know you're here with 16 girls? - Yeah. Do you know he has a pregnant girlfriend? - Shake that sweet ass. - Carrying chest. - Broke something. - With his fake dreads. It's okay, ladies. Someone that's probably doing dorime on a budget. - Who says he even paid for those drinks? - Do you get what I mean? I actually think you should post it. - Cheta! Why do you always enable me? - No, really. I actually came here to dance. - Whoa whoa whoa, a toast. - Toast, to my besties! Thank you very much. - Good morning, Auntie B. - My dear, how're you? Welcome. I told you how to do these things. You'll shift it well. Oh my God. You must be so proud of Lottie. She was absolutely amazing. - Thank you so much. - Welcome, sit down. - My son. - Auntie Bukky. - How are you? - I'm fine, ma. You and Instagram or what's it called? - Thank you. - You're welcome ma. See Damillola. - Really? - Mm-hm. Where's Tade? Good morning, Mom. Where are you? I'm at Cheta's. What's up? The profile is today. Yeah but that's supposed to be at 10. It's… Oh shit, 9:30! Mom sorry, I'll be there shortly. Get home immediately. Good morning, mommy. Cheta. Tade! I'm guessing you came to see Cheta. It's so good to see you. I'm sorry. It's just that it's been so long, Tade. Clearly not long enough for you, Chidi. - Just give me time. - Chidi, leave. Leave! Girl, see money. If I had money, life will be like a party every day. If someone gifted you an oil block, you’d be able to. You're right. Everything is by connection. I’m just praying they gift us some money. Oh, please! You're never tired of praising these rich people. You and I know that it's the lifestyle that makes the money flow. Oh please, the Niger Delta is suffering and these ones are living life. - That's the way it is. - Ahn-ahn. - Didn't I say it? - Hmm. Wow. Why are you just coming? Keep your shirt on, bro. They just got here. Ahn-ahn. And what do you think you're wearing? You think this is a joke, right? It's not that serious. It's a puff piece in a random online newspaper. Akoni Media is one of the most iconic magazines. Read by power brokers in Nigeria and beyond. An article with Akoni is going to put our family in the right... Do you really believe that shit? - Go and change. Now! - Please, who died and made you lord over me? Tade. Please, go and change. But it's still pointless. Right, Sope? I was the one that set it up, darling. Okay. In that case, it's beautiful and it's a wonderful idea. - I will go get changed. - Thank you. Darling, she'll be fine. Oba. Oba, take it easy. She doesn't know what is at stake. She doesn't. Hi, I'm Oba Kalejaye. You must be Abigail. Pleasure to meet you. I've discussed you on my show, my Instagram live a couple of times. Oba's Gems. You must have heard of it. No, no, I haven't. Oh, you should definitely check it out when you get the chance. It's absolutely amazing. This is Gbemi, the photographer. Very nice to meet you, sir. I love your show, Oba's Gems. Amazing. Thank you so much. I was pleased when Victoria told me you'd be available for the interview. You know, I, I told my wife, Sope. I said, "You are by far, one of the most incisive interviewers that we have. Our own Christiane Amanpour." - I said that, right? - Yes, yes. You did, darling. Yeah. Ah so, are we ready for the family pictures, please? - Yes, we are. - Okay. Then let's go. Of course. Yeah. Kale Oil is one of the largest indigenous oil companies in Nigeria. A true trailblazer. It's remarkable how you've remained politically active, given the amount of work it takes to build a company like Kale. Well, national service is a calling for us, the Kalejayes. My grandfather was a judge and my father was a minister in the Second Republic. National service. It does come with connections. Well, that's not why we serve. Oh no no no. Certainly not. However, some people say that those political connections, you know, they protected you from the consequences of the massive oil spill in your oil block five years ago. Mmm.Criminals. Criminals caused the oil spill. Although we took responsibility for it and paid for the clean up. How admirable of you. However, would you say that your political connections are instrumental in ensuring that your oil block license is renewed? Ex… Excuse me? What's the meaning of this nonsense? I'm just asking a question, that's all. After all, I am as incisive as Christiane Amanpour. True. Alright, then. Renewal is standard. Standard. But your recent bond-offering documents says that Kale Oil faces bankruptcy if your license is not renewed. Excuse me, can you focus on your brief and not wander? Surely you would want to address accusations that your family is trying to hold on to its wealth through political connections. - Excuse me? - Hey, Tade. Cut the crap! Cut the crap. This interview is over. It's done. Get out! All of you, get out! What is this? Let's go. I'm so sorry. How could you let this happen? It's your business to know! Oba, do not speak to her like that. This is your wife. It's fine, don't worry. Babe, I'll call Victoria. She'll kill the interview. I promise I'll sort it out. You had better. Hey, get out! We've come too far to let this screw us up. Sorry, come too far? What are you talking about? Come too far. I don't understand. Can somebody at least tell me what is going on. Mom? Dad? We had to borrow money to… clear the costs for the clean up. We had to. And unfortunately, last year oil prices crashed and so we cannot repay the loan or even get money to renew the license. Okay, dad. So, how is this an issue? Because it's very evident that it was the criminals that burst the pipes. The families affected are petitioning the government. They want our oil block to be removed and… and we cannot allow that. We cannot. But as we stand, we do not have any good standing politically. So, what? This interview was to, what? To burnish our image? Whose idea was that? I can swear that this was your idea. Do you realize that life is not an Instagram post? Will you shut up your mouth! Huh? I'll have you know that the minister herself requested for this profile. And then why didn't anybody tell me?! So you would do what? What would you do about it? My friend, go and sew some clothes. Leave the real work to the grown ups. Leave me alone. Mm-mm. - Can you imagine? - Your family can keep secrets for days. I can swear that it was Oba that told them not to tell me. - Of course, who else? - Nonsense. - I never liked that boy. - Dammit. - This looks good to me. - No. Here we go. So what now? Are you seriously planning on selling this dress for one million naira? - Um, why not? - Ahn-ahn. I'm not going to buy this dress for one million naira. - Why? - At least 250k. So, I guess your price can work. We will see what we can do. - Shit. Come and see. - What happened? My goodness! Why would you even post that? Because it's the truth and I knew you wouldn't publish it. Is a political profile now a place to be doing "Christiane Amanpour"? That sounds like a direct quote. Have you been talking to the Kalejayes? It's coming down. And that's it. Ma, it has 100,000 views in an hour. Abigail, I don't care. You promised me editorial freedom. And you have that but not on this story. Hi, everyone. This is my boss, my editor, Victoria Okupo. She's trying to kill my story on the Kalejayes due to pressure from them. Just wanted to let you know. - What are you doing? - I just told everyone on my Instagram what you did. I might post it on my Twitter later. Abigail, you're fired. Of course I'm not. What happens to your reputation as the beacon of truth in society if you fire me over the Kalejaye story? Fine. You're suspended. Two days? Okay, fine, a week. I need the rest, anyway. See you in a week. What's going on? Your father called an emergency meeting with the bankers regarding the minister's statement. What statement? The Ministry of Petroleum announced that she won't grant the waiver. I don't get it. Is this the same minister that asked for the article? She reallyn didn't have a choice. The article went viral. We tracked at least ten million views across social media. But you know that this is not your fault, right? No, I should have done my research. The reporter's family's village was in our oil block. They literally lost their livelihood after the oil spill. - Yep. - What's in there? - Vodka. - That bad? - Trust me, it's worse, darling. - Okay. - It's worse. - Okay. Okay, fine. What are you guys talking about uh? All we need is funds for the renewal. And we'll pay you once the bond is released. Oba, it is 50 million dollars. We cannot get an approval. I mean, not on top of all that you're owing currently. We're sorry. We've been instructed to put an inventory of your assets together pending... Get out. Get out. Please. You need to call the minister. She's not picking my calls. Dad, is there anybody else we can call, like, is there anything I can do? Hey, Princess, if you have nothing reasonable to add, go away. - Please... - It's alright. Take it easy. I already called Obikwe. You know he's very close to the president. Does that one ever do anything that doesn't benefit him? We'll just find a way around it. We… We'll do something about it. Don't worry, don't worry. Everything will be alright. Yeah, don't worry. Hmm? So now you can go back to your life where you're the only one who matters. We'll send your allowance. What… What are you doing? Come down. You're embarrassing us. - You're drunk. - I'm not, I'm having fun. Wait, this is new. - She just discovered her family is broke. - Wait, what? No, we're not talking about it! We're getting turnt! - She's been drinking. - I mean, I see! Why are you so boring! Uh-uh, uh-uh. Stop her, no! Tade! You know, maybe I think we should just... - Stop asking? Oh really? Yeah. - Yeah, just take her home. - I'm not ready to go home. - You're going home, Tade. - Wait, your bag. - My bag! Bye, sis! Keep spraying. Cheta, have you been working out? Because the way you lifted me up, I was like "Ooh, Cheta, so much muscles." Tade. Wow, so short. What's wrong, Mr. Obikwe? Talk to me. Talk to your best friend. I'm here. - Tade. - Yes? What? You're drunk. Me. Please look at me. I'm not drunk. I'm standing straight. Walking to you. See? Not drunk. Stop. You're like a brother to me, you know. But that didn't feel like kissing my brother. Definitely not. Hi. Look, I think you should carry me. Good. Then you can bring your lips too. - No. - Why? - Tade, you're drunk. - I'm not drunk. - Okay. - Look at my face. - Okay, I'm fine. - You're drunk. Okay, cool. Fine. - Cheta! - Are you okay? I'm naked. Why am I naked? Don't tell me, did we…? - Oh my God. - Of course not. Oh. Thank God! Do you know I thought we actually had sex. Well. I mean, judging from that reaction, it was the right decision. Come on, stop sounding like that. It's not as if we even like… Oh shit! Oh shit. We made out last night. - On that note, I think I gotta go to work. - Cheta! Cheta, come back. Come on. You need to just gimme some time. Just a little time to at least get used to the idea. Wow. - What every guy wants to hear. - That's not what I mean. Can we at least talk about this later, maybe like over dinner? You know, make light of the situation. I'm never drinking again. I spoke to Obikwe and he said he cannot help us. Did he say why? He said something about Chidi and a scandal. Chidi, what did you do? Nice to see you too. What stupid scandal have you involved yourself in? Tade, listen... Answer my question, Chidi. And don't call my name again. I had a threesome - and somebody made a tape of it. - Oh Lord. And now, people are sharing it. You had a threesome? You? Surprises me too. I don't know what happened. I don't even remember anything from that evening. Come to think of it. I'm not that much of an idiot, am I? - Hmm. - Why are you asking? How does your sex tape affect the president? You want my father to talk to the president for you? For your family? Well, I'm sorry but that's not going to happen. This week is not a good time. Chidi, please speak English. Anambra state is key to the president's reelection bid. He will do anything for anybody in that state to secure those votes. Especially the governor of the state, and I was supposed to be the governor. Wow. Look at you, and you fucked that up. Yep. Chidi, please how do we get you to become front runner again? Of what? You can't. My political career is over. I'm a laughing stock out there. Nobody votes for a laughing stock. Really, Chidi? You're trying to make me feel sympathy for you? Fair point. You know, it really hurts to see everything I've worked for over time just go down the drain like that. I mean, I didn't know those girls. I didn't. Yes. Why? Because you were probably drugged. I didn't think for a second that my opponents would stoop so low. That's horrible. Erm, why not? Is it not politics? Do you know what the bastard said on TV? No, what did he say? He said that, if I was married that I probably would have gotten away with this scandal. Erm, he's not wrong. Go and get married. You're old enough. What? Chidi, that is the thing with scandals. Scandals blow over when somebody has forgiven someone. And who better to forgive you than your wife? What are you saying, Tade? Have you forgotten? It's me, Chidi. I am not married. I don't have a wife. I'll be your wife. What? Wait. Why? Chidi, is there a way we can make this thing work? This is crazy, man. That's not the answer I was expecting. Uh… I think I know a guy I could talk to. Just let me know what he says. You're so stupid. Why did you make me wear this and what are we doing here? Tanko, that's Tade. Tade, Tanko Jatau, Senior Special Assistant to the President. - He asked to meet you in person. - So is this going to work? Straight to the point. I like it. Uh, I'm thinking about it. We'll talk about it when we finish playing. - Okay. - Playing? Playing what? Tade! We're playing flag football. Tanko insists on flag football if you must discuss business with him on Saturday mornings. Is this a joke? Why didnt you tell me? I've told you now. Come on. Chidi, there's no version of this that's more than a marriage of convenience! Offense on three, one, two, three. Let's go. Go that way, go that way. Come on! I knew you could do it. What? What's up? Tade? Fun, right? - That was fun right? - No, it wasn't. We really like Chidi. He'll be good for the people of Anambra. It's just a shame about the sex tape. So will it work? I suppose. It works everywhere else. All you need to do is just to announce your engagement, leak the sex tape and forgive him after. And um, I feel that will kill the whole sex tape story. And the waiver for Kale Oil? I really like you. Let's make this happen. Great. Thanks. - Do you think it's worth it? - What? Being married to someone that can't stand you? You left me no choice you have that effect on me. Yeah, she's definitely worth it. You did what? What is this marriage nonsense? I can't believe you wasted our time with this rubbish. Dad, please, we need to focus on our own intervention. [Tade[ This is our intervention, Oba. Right, Tanko? Who is Tanko? Eh? And why... Oh. Welcome. Happy to have you. Anyway, the Presidency will be very happy to support Chidi for Governor of Anambra state. In a show of good faith, we'll be working with the Ministry of Petroleum to issue a waiver on the event that this very marriage will occur prior to the primaries. And as a result of this, the sex tape scandal will be thrown away. Sex… sex tape? Oh, what sex tape? I might have left out a very tiny detail. Um, Chidi here, had a threesome and it was recorded. And we intend to release the video after our engagement. Jesus! Chidi had a threesome? Madness! Dad, this is madness. Darling, are you listening to this? It's, it's crazy. It's crazy. But it will work. - Thank you. - What?! It's going to be hell for you, darling. Are you sure you want to do this? - Sope, I'll be fine. I promise. - No, Tade. No! - Dad! - I will not be a party to this! - I will not. I will not! - Dad! I will not allow my daughter to be sold away in marriage on my behalf. Daddy, this is my decision. Nobody's selling me. - You shut up, Tade. - Tade, this is not your problem to solve. Otunba, I know this is unorthodox, - but your children are right. - Uh? We don't have a choice. This way it works for both of us. Oh come on. You are a credit to your family, my daughter. I'm so honoured to have you as part of mine. Mommy, please can you beg Dad and explain to him that this is the only way. - Bro! - Hey. - Sorry I came late. - What did I miss? Ah, madness. You missed madness! Tade and Chidi are getting married. - Oh, Oh. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. Cheta… Oh. - Cheta, I was... - Excuse me. What's going on here? Cheta! Cheta, please wait. Wait. Wait. - You're crazy! Crazy. - It's fine, Cheta. We need to talk. - Oh now we need to talk, innit? - Cheta, I'm doing this for my family. - What are you talking about? - Cheta, marrying Chidi saves my family. - Cheta! - You know what? I think that you just figured out a way to bring Chidi back into your life, talking about your family. - That's so unfair of you to say. - Well, fuck fair! And fuck you! You need to just gimme some time. Just a little time to at least get used to the idea. Fuck! Fuck fuck fuck! Wait, are you out of your fucking mind? It was my choice, Lottie. That even makes it worse! We’re in 2022 and you're giving yourself away like a wedding souvenir. Are you a chicken? Your parents sent me to a school my mother couldn't dream of. And if it was me, I'd just say, "Fuck you, fuck you." I'll just fuck everybody! I can't sentence my family to ruin. - Fuck your family. - Lottie! Do you want to marry Chidi? No. Then fuck him. Fuck them! - Are you sure this isn't about Dawn? - You know what? Fuck you. I deserved that. I deserved that. I deserved that. I'm sorry. - Will you be my maid of honor? - No. - Please. - Please, get out. Please. - On one condition. - What? - I'm wearing all black in protest. - Any, anything you want, yes. Wait, did you even tell Cheta about everything? - Does he know? - Don't ask me. How did he take it? Talk before I throw this remote at you. - I kissed him two days ago. - Wait, - after that night in club? - Yes. - Fuck. Alcohol is a motherfucker. - As in. - Come on, Tade. - How was I supposed to know? How are you supposed to know that you're going to marry his brother? Huh? It doesn't matter now. Geez. You know what? It doesn't even matter just like you said. But "Fuck my family," though. Really? - I guess I… I overreacted. - Yes, because you stress me out. - You're stressing me! - You stressed me. You're the one stressing me. - Please leave me alone. Leave me. - Hug me please. - My friend. - Please, get out. Get out. You even kissed Cheta. - It was nice. - It was nice. I think the Kalejaye's are so desperate. They are selling their daughter for political influence. But I'm surprised Chidi agreed. He seemed like one of the decent ones. I agree. You will be interviewing them tomorrow, with the fiancée. - Wait, is it my birthday? - No. I'm going to kill them. Trust me. - Here. - I... You know. That's leaking out tomorrow. - Hey, Sugar Daddy. - That's him! - Do you want some sugar? - That's… that's him. Really, Victoria? So are you going after a woman whose fiancee has cheated on her with two women? It was a wake-up call for me. I had been very reckless with my lifestyle. I was complacent and I made very, very bad decisions. That's an understatement. Not many women will stay after such a reveal. What do you say to those who accuse you of doing this for political power? I would say they don't know me. Yes, cause if you do, you'd know that I've spent the past few years building my brand, Dawn by Talo, with my best friend, Lottie. You know. Debuting at Paris Fashion Week is my dream. Chidi and I here, actually dated five years ago. And this politics is what separated us. You know, I want nothing to do with that life. So what changed? Darling, you can't help who you love, right? And, to be honest, that sex tape is what brought me and Chidi here together. Strangely, when the whole scandal broke, - I found myself running to her. - Aww. I just realized she was pretty much the only person I could talk to freely. They're hiding something. - Abigail. - You see it too, don't you? Why can't you just let this go? If it were you, would you let it go? What would you do if it was your grandfather who killed himself because neglect in the community caused criminals to come in and steal oil and damage the environment? What would you do? What about your fashion line? Are you going to give it all up for your man? It hasn't come to that, right? And even if it does, we all make sacrifices for love, don't we? - Of course. - Of course. Of course. So tired cause... Cheta what are you doing here? Hey, um… - Tade. - Mm-hm? I came to apologize to you, I mean, just… You don't have to apologize Cheta. It's… It's fine I should've told you. No. Tade listen, look, you were just looking out for your family and I just made it about me. I'm, I'm so sorry. Yeah. Cause it comes with the territory. Cause you're a man, - right? Mm-hm. - Wow. - You really just had to go there? - Yeah. - Mm-hm. - Fine. I take responsibility for that. Yeah, it's fine, I'm a regular saint. That's why you're my friend, That's why you like me. What's all this… What's that? No, but seriously, um… Why are you holding my hands? Why are you… - Um, I just… okay. - Say it now. Okay I'm listening. - Okay, jokes apart. - Mm-hm. I just want to let you know that um… that I'm, I'll be standing with you. No matter what. - Well I just want to say this one... - Wait Cheta wait. Because you don't have a choice, like where are you going? - Oh wow! - No, I don't mean it like, I don't mean it like... Come on, I don't mean it like that. Okay, big hug. - Okay, let's have a big hug. - Big hug. Yay! I missed you. You miss me too? You sure? Um… Um Cheta, um… I don't… I don't think that we should be doing this. - Sorry. - No, it's… - Right? Um… - Yeah. -So, -Yeah. - You need to go. Okay. - I'll go. Sorry. - Bye! - Yeah, bye. I'm still not happy that she's doing this. I'm not. She is a good child. And everything the Kalejaye name stands for is at risk. How could she not? What would you have me do? Chidi's political ambition is in the hands of that girl. What of if... She knows what's at stake, Ada. She will do the right thing. Don't "Oba" me, please. Were you not the one always supporting her? Eh, and so? Can't I change my mind? Something feels off. Like, it doesn't feel right. - Like it's… somehow. - Mmm. Doesn't feel right. What other choice do we have? Oba. Don't "Oba" me, Sope! Do you want to be poor? No, talk to me. This house? The London one? And Atlanta? All gone. You want to go back to that life? You know I didn't marry you for any of those things, dear. You know that. I know. I know. And you know that's why I love you so much. Eh? But since it's working, it has to be done. I don't like it. I don't. Listen. I need your help. I need to make Tade happy again. Okay. And how am I supposed to help? What kind of question is that? You're her best friend. See, it's not just me you're doing it for, it's for her as well. Is that right? One hundred. You look amazing. Okay, I welcome all of you. Thank you for coming. I'm sure you all know that there is a timeline. Chief Obikwe here asked for this dinner so that we can all be on the same page as we proceed. The Archbishop has agreed to officiate at the wedding. Congratulations. Yes, it was a coup. It's even better than the endorsement we were hoping he would give us. However, the only window he has is the next two weeks. Of course he does. Ah, sir, true love should never be delayed. An introduction next week in Abeokuta, - Wow. - And the white in Anambra the week after. Is this okay by you, dear? Mom, what does it matter? Now. Later. Whenever. It… it's whatever. Sorry, please excuse me. Finally you will stop pretending. But it, this… this fixes everything. That's the thing. This fixes everything but it breaks you. No… I'll be fine. Like… every... everything is going to be fine. No. No, you won't! It makes a whole lot of sense. Please, let's go to Abeokuta tomorrow. What?! Tade, let me explain. See, this may be a political union, no doubt, but it's also a marriage, and the success of it relies on you and I working on it to make it that. Now that is wisdom. Um, I'd like to speak to Chidi alone. Now. - What the fuck was that? - But we can make this work. - Wow. - It doesn't have to be all staged or bad. Come on, Tade. After all, you loved me once. Yes, Chidi. Because I was young and I was stupid. Right now, I'm neither. Tade, all this is your idea. Yes, Chidi. For a marriage of convenience. Have you forgotten why we're here? We're here because your dumb ass was stupid enough to be caught fucking two women on camera. So stop it! - Really? - Yes. - But you said it yourself, I was drugged! - Yeah. Wow, Chidi. How did they know that that would work? How? I spent the last five years looking for you in every other woman. I traveled round, all of them fake, fake, fake. You are unique. And if I couldn't find what I wanted, what does it matter what I was doing? Chidi, so romantic. Just what every woman wants to hear. "Oh, I couldn't have you, so I had to have everyone else." Just stop! No, that's… Wait. Wait. Five years ago, I chose ambition over you. And that's because I felt I didn't have another shot at your heart. What am I saying? I felt I didn't deserve another shot. But this, right now, I don't care how it started, all I know is that this one shot I have, I'm going to spend the rest of my life doing everything to make you happy. Chidi, I don't even… this is, this is so unnecessary. - Come on. - Chidi, just stop pretending. Stop pretending. You don't have to do any of this. Cause either ways, we're going to get married. So just stop. Tade. Look at me, Tade. Can you do me the honor of making me the happiest man on earth, by agreeing to be my wife? Chidi, either ways, we're getting married, what does it matter? I trust you to make all the arrangements. And if you need any help, lean on Bukky. She knows all the local vendors. Yes, mommy. Don't worry. I won't let you down. I promise. - Okay. - Hmm. What's this? Your siblings and Lottie will be go with you to Abeokuta. What? Mom, why? This is the political event of the season. And if we want it to be successful, Sope needs to start work yesterday. Don't worry, I'll make it as painless as possible. I promise, you hear? Thank you. Excuse me. Tade, we need to talk now. Something has come up. Okay, I'll start contacting the vendors in Abeokuta and see what venues we can use. Tanko asked me to ask you to withdraw from Battle of the Brands. - What?! Why? - That was exactly my reaction. I don't know. Calm down. Bring your voice down. He says the interview we did was met with mixed reactions. Which means, for my campaign you have to be present. So the timing doesn't work. If you're not at my campaign, the optics will not be right and it will affect my chances of becoming Governor. - And you becoming First Lady. - Of course. - I'm sorry, Tade. - Yes you are, Chidi. Tade, Tade. Tade. Guess who is outside the Kalejaye mansion? That's right, it's me. And what did I just see, if not Tade Kalejaye stalking away her fiancé, Chidi Obikwe, as he tries to hold her hand. What's up with that? I thought they were supposed to be madly in love? Were the political detractors right? Is this a fake marriage? And does this have anything to do with the reason why the waiver was given to Kale Oil? Watch and see. What is wrong with you? - Is it my fault? - You've put everything in jeopardy. Is it my fault that she followed us here? It didn't have to be her! It could have been anyone! The staff could have seen, could have talked. Tade, you forced us down this path, the least you can do is to be responsible. You're being ridiculous! - Sope? - Listen, listen. From this moment on, you're going to begin to take this very seriously. - Wow! - Yes. We need to set up a… a schedule of events here in Abeokuta. You know, media tour… everything, everything. - Oba, you must be joking. - Do I look like I'm joking? - Set it up, my love. - I will. Tade, he's under a lot of pressure. You have to understand. Sope, why are you making excuses for him. Because he's right! Tade, we have to undo the damage that you've caused, otherwise we all wasted our time coming here. Don't you get? - Do what you need to. - Tade. Why is Veronica calling me to say she's sorry we pulled out? Lottie, I had no choice. You had no choice? It's our choice? It's our choice to make and not your decision alone! Lottie, this is my family. I had to. You had to. You're so selfish. Shit. Do you know that this is all your fault? How is it my fault? I mean, she loved my brother. Is that what she told you? Did she come up to you and say, "Cheta, I'm in love with Chidi." Why are you not fighting for her? Tade loves you. It's already too late for that now, anyways. So you're just going to watch her give up her dreams for her family? Her family... And watching her die for them because of their "selfish reasons." If you touch that bottle… If you touch it. I'm talking... You want to drink? I'm just worried. The waiver. It's not airtight. The government can pull it. Don't worry about it, darling. Trust me, we'll be fine. Okay? Okay. Anyway, I'll just need you to go through this discretion clause. - Okay. - Um… Please, just ignore me. I want to get another bottle of champagne. Excuse me. Tade has spoilt this girl. Come in. - Hey. - Hey. - Are you… are you okay? - No. Yeah. You're um… you're working on the dress yeah? Yeah, the irony, Cheta. I finally have the dress when I don't need it anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Well uh, you can actually um, make it your wedding dress? Why are you trying to make me laugh? If you don't joke about it then, what are you gonna do? - Yeah, true. - Huh? So is that for me? Oh, yeah. Um, your favorite, actually. I know. So hey… Yeah… there you go. That's enough. I don't want too much. Thanks. Well, I would keep up with you and not take too much as well cause… Yeah. - Cheers. - Come on. Yeah. You have to look… You know what they say about not… Of course. Geez, I'm not afraid to look at you. Cheers to… a whole lot more threesomes. - Wow! - Or maybe not, maybe not. - Wow, Cheta. - What? - I actually hate you. - Well, luckily for you, I love you. I do. Is that what this is about? What? So, you're trying to take advantage of the sad girl? Wow, okay. Tade, if you're going to pick a fight with me, go ahead do it. Knock yourself out. It just might work. Wow. Guess what? Come I want... I have something to tell you. - Come. Come, come. - What? - So… Mm-hm. - Come close, yeah. - Fuck you. - Oh boy, get away. Promises, promises, yeah. - What? - Promises. Ah, I don't get. Tade. Tade. Yeah? Come in. We need to talk. - Yeah. - Hello? Well um… - I guess I'll… I'll see you. Yeah. - Yeah. Oga, you forgot your bottle. I changed my mind. You can leave it. Chidi, sit down. Tade, no matter how bad my day is, I just see you and I melt. - Chidi, stop. - I can't give up, Tade. You know me. I'll always keep trying. You said it yourself. I'll always keep trying. Yeah. She smiles. That's some progress. Let me ask you a question. - Would you have said "yes" five years ago? - What? - I don't know. - If I'd asked you to marry me, would you have said yes? I don't know, Chidi. I guess we'll never know. I'm not wearing you the ring. Take your ring. - I don't want us to live like this. - Chidi, you'll be fine. I don't want to be fine, hmm? I want to be more than fine. I want to be everything. I want to be you. I want to be Tade. See, two hearts, one glass. - Chidi, please. - Let me take you out tonight. No. I'm not following you anywhere. It was following you somewhere that brought me here in the first place. - Really? - Yeah. Do you know the first time I actually ever told you how I felt? I was holding a glass of wine like this and you were smiling, looking at me like this. - See? That was the old testament... - Ugh. Chidi, I will foll... I'll follow you out. I will go with you. Say no more. What are we doing here? I happened to be with Sope when she was curating the list of places we should visit. Watch your step. And Orange Bar was one of them. - Okay. - Uh-huh, and I said, "Why not?" Funny enough, she was going to cancel it, that the bar is too local. I'm like, I like local bars. Remember those karaoke nights when we used to get drunk then sing. Come on, this will be fun. I'm sure you'd like it. - Let's sing together. - No, no, no, no. No! A special number for my girl in the building. Come and sing. Come on. I don't know the lyrics so much. You can. Come on. My wife. Ladies and gentlemen, my wife. Lottie, I think we need to talk. Yeah. Because it just seems like you want to be angry at me for no reason. And if you felt there was something else I could have done differently, I feel like you should have told me. Wait, are you a child? Really? We are partners. And you don't fucking make decisions that will affect the two of us! It's "Dawn by Talo." Tade and Lottie. What you would have done was to talk to me. Obviously. Lottie, this order was from the political people. I had zero wiggle room. Well, good for you. I think you should leave my room. I was trying to get some sleep. I'm tired, I'm tipsy. I just need rest. Please, leave my room. Lottie look, I almost kissed Cheta tonight. Then I now kissed Chidi after. Of course, I knew it. Isn't that why you came? You came here to talk about Cheta and Chidi. It has always been about you. - Lottie! - Don't even Lottie me. You came here to talk to me about you. Hoping I'd be there for you just like I've always been since we were little. Ahn-ahn, it's Lottie, the housekeeper's daughter that we saved from poverty. That has always had no choice but to obey. I don't even see you like that. How can you even say that to me? See, I don't even care what you think right now. I think you should go talk to Chidi, Cheta, your brother. Whoever cares to listen to your family problem or whoever cares to listen to your self- sacrificing journey that you've been on. Fuck you, Lottie. Yes, I said that. Do you think its been easy for me? Really, think about it. You think it's easy for me to just come and tell you, "Oh yes, I'm about to shatter our dreams." Dreams that we have spent years trying to build. Lottie, if I had thought about this for five more minutes, I would have told my family to go to hell. You're my sister. And I love you so much. I always have since we were little. But you see this? I have to do it. And it's beyond me. Cause I truly need you and that's why I came here. I'm tired. You know I'm only fighting because I love you too, right? - I know. - I'm tired. And I love you too. But I need you and that's why I came here. - You still need to leave my room. - I'm not going anywhere. Who did you kiss first? - Is it Cheta or Chidi? - How can that be your problem right now. - Who kissed... - I said, I almost kissed Cheta. - So, who did you kiss for real? - Chidi. And he milked it. - You're so stupid. - I know. I'm so stupid. You must be in front of me. No, wait. Eh-eh? I thought he went. He's always behind. This one. Yeah. How do you see this? Would it fit me? You like? It's nice? I'll take this one. What about this one? This one has pockets. I think I like this one. Tade, what do you think? - I love it. Hi, Cheta. Smile, babe. - It would suit me, right? Okay. Cheta, smile now. You're making it too obvious. I'm smiling now, please. What kind of fake smile is that? Eh-eh. - I'm smiling. - It's still fake. You when you found out, did you not frown your face? I know how to pretend. It wasn't that obvious. I wonder if you guys are actually gonna be able to continue the fashion line. Why would she do that? Did you not study accounting? Trust me, uh, we'll have a very nice space for you in our accounting department. Sorry, my love. You understand? That way, you even get to make more money. You know, you need more money to take care of your mom. Auntie Bukky is not getting any younger. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Yeah, that one. - Can you imagine? For the longest time, I thought this guy was misunderstood, man. - He's a total asshole. - He's a… He's a bozo. Wealth is lost on him. Are we complaining? How do you know these are the original documents? The government should come out and confirm. A letter from the Ministry of Petroleum saying that the waiver would not be extended. And then two days later, the Ministry signs an agreement giving Kale Oil a two-year extension on fees and royalties. The only thing that changed is the announced engagement between Tade and Chidi. I'm bringing this to everyone's attention so that the questions can be asked. Why did the government change its mind on Kale Oil? What are they not telling us? And these are the questions we need the government to answer. Signing out, Victoria Otukpo. - This changes nothing. - Unfortunately, it changes everything. How, Tanko? One unsubstantiated report. It's… of no import. The Minister of Petroleum is tendering her resignation over the improper extension of the license. The Presidency is making moves to reclaim your oil block. So you think I will just sit by and allow my family to go into ruin? No, I will fight you with everything I have! Everything. That is your prerogative, Otunba. Nigerians want this fight, the Presidency will. Look, Otunba, we have prepared our offer of ten million dollars. For your settlement. Accept this deal, Otunba. You cannot find a better one. Otunba, take it easy. Okay? This was where the women and the children hid, while men faced the war. Wow. We might just pass. Wh... What?! Move on to Tade Kalejaye. Tade, what did you do? What are you talking about? Wait, did you catch cold feet? Is that why you decided to sabotage us? What are you... What are you actually talking about? What are you saying? So, who leaked the agreement?! Huh? Tell me. We were the only ones that had it! - Stop it. - Why would I do that? Who knows. Who knows what goes through that fish brain of yours. No, tell me. Okay, now Abigail has leaked the agreement. She's released it. Everyone has seen it. You, you, you, we are all fucked! Do you hear that?! - Oba, wait. I… - Look now! - I didn't, I… - What is wrong? - Chidi, Chidi what are you doing? - Wait, wait. I got this. I have this. - Chidi. Chidi! - Why did you do that? What do you mean? Why are you pushing me? For what? You want to sabotage me? Is it my fault that she didn't choose you? - Eh? - Chidi! Is it my fault that you didn't have the balls to tell her how you feel? Or ask her out? - Chidi, stop. - You're definitely out of your mind. - Cheta. Don't do that, man. - Chidi! Cheta! - Cheta, how can you do that? - Didn't you see how he was pushing me?! - Hey, hey, hey! It's okay. - Hey, what? Let him come to me. Bring it! The both of you stop! Chidi! Stop it! The two of you, stop it! Stop it Chidi! - Stop it! - Chidi stop now. What the fuck is wrong with you, Chidi? Chidi how do you know that he's the one? - Because you tell him everything! - I didn't tell him, Chidi. And you, why are you fighting like a ten year old? Well, he started it! And what agreement are you talking about? Don't worry about it. Lottie. Why? Tade, but, but, but you said it yourself. "If I had thought about it for a second, I'd have told my family to fuck off." I did it so you don't have to. Tade, you told her about the agreement? - How could you be so irresponsible? - Oba, I didn't tell her! Oba, I didn't tell her anything. Oba, she didn't tell me, you did. What? - Okay. - Um… Please, just ignore me. But you showed her, you gave her the agreement! I didn't show her. Oba, calm down. She didn't show me. You did too. Wow! that's a nice shirt. - Right? - Yeah. Let me take a picture, of you with your phone. - Alright. - Yeah, you will like it. Fine. Smile. - So nice. Wow. - Really? Yeah. Yes. - Okay. - Okay. Yes, I'm done. Check and see if you like them. Yes. Just calm down. After everything my family has done for you. Just calm down. - You ungrateful wretch! - Oba calm down. So you chose to sacrifice your sister for your selfish gain? Eh? - I chose not to allow it. - Allow! Allow what? - Are you mad? Who are you to allow? - Oba, -stop. Oba, calm down.- -Who are you to allow? Who is this... Please wait, just calm down, please. She's a woman. Calm down. Lottie, this was not your place. Lottie, you had no fucking right! Why did you do that? Tade, you don't owe your family anything. Their livelihood shouldn't take your life! It's not worth your life. Lottie, I fucking trusted you. Leave. - I'm gonna kill you. - I'll leave with all pleasure. At least, I tried my best! And I won't watch you throw your life away. Fuck off! Fuck off! Lottie, I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. Do you hear me? I will kill you! Please stop. Stop. Stop recording! Wow! Congratulations. This is a big win. Thank you so much for believing in me. The government has blacklisted us. No more government ads. That's the price you pay for telling the truth. - Victoria? - Yes? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Well done. I don't understand. If the government has taken away our oil block, why do I still have to get married? Why don't you look at it this way? If you don't, then the position that this was a fake marriage holds. Why do we care? Why do we care what they think? These people have taken away our oil block so why do we care? Why? Okay. The government has offered a settlement. - Wow. - Ten million dollars. Look, the marriage only has to last for about a year or two. - A year or two. - It's for the best. Of course, mom. It is. You're leaving, eh? Yeah. I don't wanna dignify this farce with my presence. You know, I've always known that you liked her. And you didn't care. Because you didn't make your move. That's what strong men do. They make their move. Besides, she made her decision. You know, you actually give all this… all this talk about how you love her. But allowing her to do all of this stuff, does it show love? I did not allow her! I did not allow her do anything. She had to make a choice. A choice between two men. And she chose me. Me! Let me tell you something. Tade is a force. You can't make her do anything she doesn't wanna do. I just let her be. Good luck. How can they ask this of her? And how can you let them?! We need this money, Sope. Our family needs the money. No, we don't need the money. My events and PR company makes at least 80 million a year. We can use that until you're back on your feet. Are you forgetting that you're an experienced businessman with an MBA from Harvard? Why don't you use your head! - What do you want from me? - Stand up for your sister! How can you allow them to put her in this position? - I'm sorry. - Sorry for yourself. Better man up and be the man that I married. Can I have a moment, please? Um, I'll be outside, Tade, if you need me. Hi, Mom. Come sit by me. What I want… more than anything is for you to be happy. Mom, I think it's a little bit too late for that. And it is my hope that since you once loved Chidi, you could learn to love him again. Mom, what I think you hope for is that since I once loved Chidi, you want me to love him again, so that you don't feel guilty for pushing me into a loveless marriage. And you must forgive Lottie. That kind of loyalty is not to be taken for granted. What I've learned, in the end is, those that love you sacrificially, are the ones that matter the most. See you out there? This is the groom you said you didn't know. My entire family, the husband who has come to take our child. The child who we raised with wealth and affection, that is, Tade, is who I've brought to you. You're going to prostrate. My entire family, bless them with joy. Say in the name of Jesus the marriage will succeed. That it shall be well with him. For in Jesus's name we pray. Arise and shine. So right now, we're going into the Introduction proper. You know the Yoruba say, "A large thorn causes the back to hit the ground." So we're starting from - the bride's older brother. - I've been meaning to ask you a question. What? When I was fighting with Cheta, why did you choose to protect him? Huh? My name is Oba Kalejaye. Uh, I'm the bride's elder brother. Next to him. Chidi, I don't know what you're talking about. I hope you will take care of our beautiful daughter as well. Wait, what are you talking about? I'm not frowning. You clearly don't want to do this. You're acting like we're forcing you. Wa... What are you talking... …and I say that my family will take care very good care of her. Chidi, what are you doing? - What am I doing? - What are you doing?! - What's best for you. - Chidi! - Pops, -Chidi! I don't think I want to go on with this but I'll explain later. Uh… I, I really am sorry but… I tried. I tried, but this is not working for me. I… I'm not ready to get into this kind of life. Okay? - Chidi! - You'll forgive me, right? Everyone's finally gone. The village people insisted on partying. Girl, you know ain't no party like an Abeokuta party. - They'll go in. - I hear you. And the Presidency has confirmed that our deal still stands. - Really, Oba? - Wow. That's important too. Wow. -Tade, -Yeah? Bro. Thank you. Uh, really, really. Thank you. I mean, I know it wasn't easy, but then, I appreciate the sacrifice you were willing to make. Stop. Wait, did that… Did… No, no, no. Wait. - I'll take it back, if you're not careful. - Hold up, wait. No, no. Did that just happen? Aw. Oba, I love you too even though you're an asshole. But you're still my brother. - I love you. - I love you too. Do you know what you're going to do about the brothers? Wow, Sope. You're really his wife. I need a breather, guys. - What brothers? - She loves two of them now. - My Obikwe princes. - Right? - Tade, wait. - Yes? You love two brothers. - Bro. - Ch... That's Chidi and Cheta? - They're my friends. - Right. In Christ. God forbid. Are you serious? Bro, it's not like that. It's not, it's not the way she's saying it. It's deeper. You love two brothers.
