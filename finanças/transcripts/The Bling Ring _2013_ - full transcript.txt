She's in Paris at fashion week. - Shut the fuck up. We just went in. Yeah, look at their chill-ass Chanel purses, dude. What the fuck are you doing? Come on. - Come on now. - Puff, puff, pass. Puff, puff, puff. Rebecca's, like, biggest conquest was Lindsay Lohan. She was her ultimate fashion icon. Lindsay Lohan is fighting back against accusations... she stole a $2,500 necklace from a Southern California jewelry store. Her attorney addressed the matter for the first time. This is the dress she wore to the Cosmopolitan opening. Oh, my God. Let me see it. I want to try it on. It's amazing. These are cute. These are really useful. Yeah. When are you coming back from Vegas? I don't know. Just gonna stay with my dad until things calm down with my mom. - I'll call you from there? - Okay. Will you hold on to some of my stuff for me? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. Bye. Bye. Ciao. Why do you think Rebecca was so obsessed with these women and their clothes... enough to steal? I just think she wanted to be a part of, like, the lifestyle. Like, the lifestyle that everybody kind of wants. Lindsay Lohan gave police the security footage... from the night of March 23, when her house was burglarized. Comparing the clips... it looks like these are the same burglars... as in the Audrina Patridge security video... and police are investigating the connection... of the Hollywood Hills burglaries. If you have any information, please contact the L.A.P.D. Marc and Rebecca were bragging about it at a party. They said they had been in Rachel Bilson's house and Lindsay Lohan's. They said they went to Paris Hilton's, like, eight times. That's Marc Hall, Rebecca Ahn and Chloe. I don't know her last name. And Nicki Moore. L.A.P.D. Open the door! L.A.P.D. Open the door! - Is this the home of Marc Hall? - Yes. - We have a search warrant. - I'll... I'll get him. Marc. Mom. Okay. Whatever it is, we'll figure it out. It's gonna be okay. Ma'am. You have the right to remain silent. Understand? Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. What's going on here? What's this all about? - Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step aside. - Honey. You have the right to speak to an attorney present during any questioning, okay? And if you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you. All right? Let's go. - Marc. Over here. - Marc, right over here! - Right here, buddy. - Hey, Marc. Right here. Los Angeles Police. - Yes? - Ma'am, we're the police. - Is this the home of Nicolette Moore? - Yes. We have a search warrant to search the house. Ma'am, can you please step out of the way? - Out of the way. - For what? - Is anyone else in the house, ma'am? - Mom? - My kids. - Call them downstairs. - What's going on? - Come downstairs, you guys. Come downstairs right now. - What's going on? - Where are they going? Ma'am, you need to secure your animal-now. Pick up your dog. Ma'am, you have any weapons in the house? - No. - Okay. What is this about? Wait. What is going on? I'll explain everything to you before we're done. Nicolette? - Yeah. - Sit down over there. - Why? - What did I do? Just sit down. - Just sit down. - Why? We're conducting an investigation. Before we're done... I promise you I'll explain everything. - Why do I have to sit down? - Zip it. - Put your hands behind your back. - Mom? - Mom? Mom? - Excuse me. Sorry. - Excuse me. - Get her back. - Can you stop... - I need you to stop right here. - I need to speak to my mom. - ...what you're doing with my daughter. I need to speak to my mom. Mom? - Call the lawyer. Call a lawyer! - Mom, why are they taking her? You're hurting me. You're really hurting me. Mom. Can you call the... I want to talk to my mom. - Hello? How can I help you? - Is this the home of Rebecca Ahn? I'm her mother, but she's staying with her father in Nevada. Easy, Tank. What the fuck, man? Chloe. - Carrot-beet? - No. Crystal! Crystal. Crystal. Chloe. Then Rebecca wanted to go to Orlando Bloom's. We knew he was away, from the Internet. You know, you Google his name... and it says Orlando Bloom's shooting a movie in New York, and he's with Miranda Kerr. So we just walked in. The door was unlocked. There was no alarm. The door was unlocked? I'm really sorry about what I did. Did you know Rebecca was leaving the state? I... I just knew that she was going to stay at her dad's... because she wasn't getting along with her mom and her stepdad. You didn't know she was taking stolen property... across state lines and leaving you holding the bag? I thought she was just gonna go see her dad. Metro Police. Are you Rebecca Ahn? - Yes. - We have a warrant to search the premises. Step aside. Move back. Bobby. Downstairs. Jeff, upstairs. See what you find. Here's your warrant. Do you know why we're in your home, serving you a search warrant? - Yes. - Why do you think we're here? My friend Marc was arrested. He called me from jail... and said the police had done a search warrant on his home. - Do you know why? - I've been watching TMZ. They've been saying I'm a person of interest in these burglaries. Were you involved in these burglaries of these celebrities? No, I wasn't. Is there going to be any property from those burglaries in this residence? - No. - Have you ever been... - to these celebrity homes that were burglarized? - No. Could any of your fingerprints or D.N.A... - be found in any of the victims' homes? - No. You boys having fun? Find something interesting? What? - Yeah, we got a few things on the list. - Right on. Anything else? - Yeah, we also came up with these. - Nice. We found a jacket and jeans that match a description by Lohan... and some personal photographs of Paris Hilton. If I tell you where everything is, would you let me go? Hypothetically, let's say I can help you locate this property... and tell you who has it, how would that help me? Rebecca Ahn, thought to be the ringleader, was arrested... and awaits her hearing with the other members. Stay tuned for the latest on the Bling Ring. Did you speak to any of the victims? I've spoken to all the victims. Really? What did Lindsay say? - Nicki. Nicki. - Nicki. Nicki. - How was it in there? - It was not good. Okay, thank you. Nicki. Kate from Vanity Fair is here. Can I get you something to drink? So how is Sam related? - We have adopted her. - I was friends with her mother. - Mom, this is my interview. - Okay. Yeah. So, she has been living with us. We met when my parents divorced... and now my mom homeschools all of us. Based on the philosophy of The Secret... which is based on the laws of attraction. - Can I talk, please? - Sure. I'm sorry. The reason that we related so well... is that my dad is a recovering alcoholic... - and Sam's mom... - She's a practicing... is a practicing drug addict and alcoholic. And our moms became, like, best friends. - We were, and she went off the deep end. - Please! - So, basically you took her in. - Yes. We took her in about six years ago. But let's... Let's... Let's get back to Nicki, okay? So Adam here told me that you do charity work. Yes. We do a lot of stuff through our church. It's called the Agape Church. - Right. - It's the religious science philosophy... beneath The Secret. My other sister, Gabby, is on a trip with them building homes. And they do a yearly trip to Africa... where they build wells and schools for kids. Which country? I can't remember exactly which country... but we do bake sales and, like, feeding the homeless and that kind of stuff. Okay. So there's a little bit of a disconnect... between your positive pursuits and what's happening now. Nicki, I don't want you to answer that comment. Well, I think that I am. Don't. I have, like, a good statement to say about this. She could speak generally. I think this situation was attracted into my life... as a huge learning lesson for me... to grow and expand as a spiritual human being. I believe that I am an old soul. You are, honey. She is. We've gotten to know Nicki and her family... and we believe that she is an extremely focused and honest young woman... who has a lot to offer the community. And we agree that there has not been a disconnect. That there were circumstances that happened... but Nicki herself has continued to stay on her plane... despite the tumultuous experiences happening. What's your goal, or life plan, if you have one? I do. I think it's my journey... to push for peace and the health of the planet. Nicki's expressed to me a lot of her humanitarianism. It's my main goal. I... want to be a leader... and do things that people really notice. That's why I'm taking business- so that I can be a leader... and-and take a stand for people. But I went to Indian Hills to learn and be with my peers... but I was always self-conscious that I wasn't, you know, as good-looking as other people. And now you're a star. Yeah... On my Facebook page recently... I had over 800 friend requests. I accepted them all. I mean, I didn't even look at them. And then I noticed someone had created a fan page for me. It's just kind of awkward that so many people are loving me... for... for something that's so looked down on in society. If it had been, you know, something that were to benefit the community... or something like that, I'd love it. But it's kind of showing America has this. This sick fascination with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing. Does this look good? Is this conservative? If you like a secretary-style hooker. Bite me. Maybe with a jacket? Well, it looks better. Right? You need lower heels. Yeah. Where are my kitten heels? You're so lucky you weren't on that video. I know. Sucks. Yeah. It does. Maybe I need to wear something longer. Do you own anything longer? No. Mom does. Can I have a five-milligram Adderall? Okay, just remember what we went over with Shannon. They can't prove that you were in any of those houses, okay? - I know, Mom. - All right? Do you want to just ground ourselves really quick? Nicki? I know there is one mind, one presence and one power. - Mom, shouldn't we go? - Emily. - What? - Stop talking. - She's praying. I know I'm always protected, and karma cleanses my journey. Thank you, Lord, so much for this truth. - And so it is. - And so it is. So it is. And you rock, girl. Okay? Right here. Right here. Nicki. Nicki. - Okay, Nicki. - Hey, Nicki, Nicki. Can we get a comment? Nicki. Nicki. - Nicki. - Nicki. Nicki. This has been a very difficult time for myself and my family. Thank you for respecting my privacy. I look forward to my day in court. Chloe! - Marc. - Marc. Right here. Right here. Hey, Marc. How does it feel to be a rat? Okay. Remain seated. Come to order. Division 31 is now in session. The Honorable Judge Patricia Henley presiding. - Good morning. - Good morning. Are all parties ready? Rebecca Ahn, you are found guilty... on four counts of first-degree residential burglary. You are sentenced to four years in state prison and $800,000 in restitution. Marc Hall, you are found guilty on four counts of first-degree residential burglary. You are sentenced to four years.

You are sentenced to one year in county jail and $300,000 in restitution. Members of the Bling Ring were sentenced today... for their role in a rash of break-ins... that netted more than three million in high-end goods. We're here with Nicki Moore, who just served 30 days for her involvement in the Bling Ring... and shared a cellblock with one of its victims, Lindsay Lohan. There were reports that Lindsay was crying. With you being next to her, did you actually hear any of this? Yeah. I could hear her crying the first day... which is really hard when you're just trying to be strong. But I just really kept to myself... and just tried to get through the day. It's hard when you're woken up at, like, 5:30. And how'd she look? She got to keep her extensions in. A lot of the girls were talking-“ I had to take my weave out,” or whatever. But she was in orange like all of us. Now, were you nervous being next to her? Because you actually were accused of being a part of the group... that allegedly robbed her house. Yeah. I mean, it was scary for me. They were showing the surveillance video. They were showing the story on TVs inside... and, you know, little do people know... that when that first video came out... I was actually in contact with her manager... to tell her who I believed the people were who robbed her house. I mean, when I get to tell my side of this story... people are gonna know the truth. So, that's nerve-racking. She could think you robbed her house. Yeah. She could have. But, you know, anyway... you can follow everything about me and my journey...
