What you're doing is very brave. But I don't want to. But you must. No, no, no, no, no! Daddy! It's going to be OK. No, no, no. I cannot. Stop! Morning, Ollie. I see you got the old girl up and running. Yeah. I got her fixed. How's the tractor doing? It's turning into an eyesore, just like the rest of the place. A little birdie tells me that you have a family in need for a place to stay. But you're not into it. Look, you got to do the right thing. Family means everything to the people of this town. You can't just turn people away and not take people in. Understand? Getting late. All right then. Listen, do the right thing. You'll be a better man for it. And the people of this town will appreciate you for it. Well, that's Uncle Ollie. OK, guys, you need to be on your best behavior, please. He's doing us a huge favor. Yeah, make a good impression because we're new. Remember little Maggie? She's our creative one. She wants to be a writer. It takes everything we have to keep up with her imagination. Let's go inside. My home is your home. Come on then. Let me show you to your rooms. We really do appreciate this, Uncle Ollie. And it'll only be a night or two. I promise. Yeah. Thanks, man. There you go. Make yourselves at home in there. You OK? Bad feeling. You are truly unbelievable. Beats the alternative, right? Middle of the damn night? The kids are scared. We drove 10 hours. You need to get a job, Neil, or we're done for real this time. I have to take care of my kids. I cannot take care of you too. Grow up. Stop Yeah. This place is creepy. We can't stay here more than a night or two. I'm just going to figure out. What is there to figure out? I mean, you stole from your boss. What were you thinking? I was thinking we needed the cash. You told me we had plenty of cash. You told me we had nothing to worry about. So you're just a liar? I didn't lie. I had it. You idiot. You gambled it? So you had enough cash that we could pay our rent, and then you gambled it. Real smart. That's why we're here, isn't it? We have nowhere else to go. That's why we're here. And we cannot stay here. This place gives me the creeps. This place is a palace. We'll make the best of it for as long as we can. I've told you the stories about him. Yeah, so? Christ, Neil! He's a freak. It's the whole town. I mean, nobody here is right in the head. I'm serious. We can make it work. Ugh! This is stupid. Come on, just do a few. Red. Red. Red. Black. Red. Black. See, you're definitely psychic. I am not! No one gets them right all of the time. I'm not right all the time. Come on, try again, all right? Black. See? Family meeting. There are some things going on that you wouldn't fully understand. Try me. Fine, maybe you would understand, but you don't need to know about them. When dad was here, we never had to move. Maggie, hey, come on. It's not helping. No, you come on, Mom. He lost his job again, right? That's it? We are trying. Sometimes, trying isn't good enough. How long are we going to be here? It could be a little while. Just do me a favor and stay out of Uncle Ollie's hair, all right? I've never been much of a cook. I can help with that, Uncle Ollie. Yeah, right. I'll try. We do really appreciate your letting us stay. So what's the deal? Well, I had a job at a dealership. Went well for about six months. I was top sales for two months straight, actually. Anyway, things just dried up, and my side business fell through. Yeah, everything just dries up or falls through. It's real rough times out there. Maggie. We thank you for this food and for all sacrifices, large and small. In name we pray. Can you spell that, Maggie, put it away. Now. I don't like it here. I know. It's cold. Do you want to go inside? Not that kind of cold. Something's wrong with him, I think. This place just feels weird. It'll be OK. Maybe it can be fun. Tomorrow, we explore. They can't stay. We decided we wouldn't do this anymore. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do this. Please, please. Please let me go. Do you want us to starve, Huh? No. The whole town is going to starve. And you're being selfish! You know that this is the only way. No. No. No! Let's see if the sacrifice is pure enough. No! No, no, no! Please stop. Tell me. Come on. Look. What's that smell? Something in there. What is it? What are you kids doing? You two stay away from this barn. A lot of equipment in there. It's dangerous. And you definitely stay away from this room. A couple of kids like yourself get hurt in there, really bad. You understand? Now, go on. What is it? demands a sacrifice. Come on. Let's go. Hurry. What is this? I don't know. Must be where they kept animal feed. Where are the animals? Don't know. What is this? Probably just dirt or something. Looks like blood. Do you think it's blood? And they say I'm the one with the active imagination. Quit freaking yourself out. So do we really think there's anything dangerous in that barn? I don't like that look. OK, we can't not go inside. The way that he said it was practically an invitation. Stay out of this room. You're crazy. OK, a dare then. He was basically daring us. Maggie, it wasn't a dare. It was not a dare! I hope you like it. I haven't really cooked in a while. It's delicious, Mom. It's a stupid scarecrow. Yeah, it is. But it's a creepy scarecrow, so it doesn't do it's job. Yes, it does. It's a very creepy scarecrow. I mean, it scares the crows away, so it's doing its job. I have no at all. That's the point. Good job. Good job. That section, that entire line is just terrible. I really don't think we should be doing this. Come on. You first. Age before beauty. There must be 100 reasons for me not to punch you right now. I just can't think of one. What is this? Ew. Gross. Looks like animal bones. Weird. Hey, Jake, be more careful. Hello? Hello? Anyone there? Want to try? Don't let go. Ask who it is. Who is this? David. Hello, David. Jake. Who are you? What do you see around you? Us? Ask who else is with him. David, who else is with you? Why don't you kids put yourself to use? Help me load this truck. Got to bring it to the neighbor's veggie stand. Maybe we should ask our mom. Mom. What is it? Uncle Ollie us to help move stuff at a veggie stand or something. Shouldn't be more than a couple of hours. Are you sure? I don't want them to be too much of a bother. It's no bother. I can use the help. As long as it's no bother. Let's get to it. Behave yourselves. I just don't trust him with the kids. It's fine. They'll be fine. What if something happens? Nothing is going to happen. When the cat's away, the mice will play. Squeak, squeak. How far is it? Just up the road. So what's the deal with those parents of yours? No deal. What the hell you scribbling for when we're talking? You know that's rude? I can do both. I'm a modern woman. I can write and talk. I guess you're the smart mouth of the family. Sure makes sense. Your mama was that way too. You're going to be just like her when you're older. Maybe. Sure you will. All her problems are self-imposed. And she goes and marries that fool. Same crap, different generation. Why don't you get those out for me and load them onto the veggie stand? Slim pickings again, huh? Another tough season. You OK, Mister? Yeah, I'm just fine. Who might you all be? Pay them no mind, Jeremiah. It's hard to find good help these days. That's all. So they'll have to do. Hey, why don't y'all help me pick out some good ones? I won't bite. Come on. Are these the children I keep hearing about? That's them. They're absolutely precious. You didn't tell me you were bringing them. Well, it's good to have help in tough times. Don't you think? I figured you should meet them anyways. Thought maybe-- keep an eye on them for a bit while I fix up the tractor, maybe share a lemonade or something? I don't think that's a good idea, Ollie. No, I want to. Why don't we do that? How would you all like to have a tall-- please. All right, I guess. Listen. Listen. You need to take your little brother You need to get out of here. You need to get out as soon as you can. You going to get yourself some lemonade? Sure. That could be worth something. Ho old are you two? I'm 15. Jake's 12. How do you like the farm life? It's all right I guess, except-- What? Well, it's kind of creepy. You don't have to be afraid. Your uncle seems rough. But trust me when I tell you. He's just a big teddy bear inside. Isn't that right, Walter? Oh, yeah, he's a real softy. How are your parents holding up? It's our mom. Our real dad's dead. Oh, dear. I'm sorry to hear that. He tends to be an oversharer. He just really misses him. That's all. It's OK, Jake. It's all right to miss people who are gone. I know-- Annie! Please excuse me. Sorry about that, kids. Let's finish up here. Let's get back to work. OK? Weird. So bizarre. Holy smokes, this is old. You two don't say much. Do you? How was the lemonade? Come on. Speak up, boy. Annie cried. Well, that figures. She's a very sad lady. Why? She's sad because her boy ran away a long time ago, and she misses him. You're about the same age as he was. What was his name? His name was David. That was fast. Was it? I think so. Meanwhile, why don't you help Uncle Ollie with it? I got it. See? He's got it. No need. There you go. No need, the man said. Lazy and a loser. Nice. You think that David from the radio is Annie's missing son? Probably. I think we should try to call him again. You sure you want to do that? No. I don't know. We should. Shouldn't we? David, come in, David. Are you there? Ask who it is. David, hello? Hello? David, is that you? I'm not David. My name is Rose. Ask if she knows David. Rose, do you know David? Yes, I know David. We're looking for him. Do you know where he is? Yes. Are you with him? Yes. Help! Help! Rose? Rose, are you there? What's going on? I don't know. We have to tell mom. No. We can't say anything to anyone, not yet. What am I going to do? What if the stay? How We've waited this long. If I could just get them to leave. Who are you talking to? I don't know. I do know. It's like when you had the nightmares about the gun. Right? If we knew then what we know now then Dad might still be here. Dreams don't mean anything. Yes, they do. They don't! We have to do this. Come on. All right. Let's go. What's he doing? I don't know. He's in the barn. I don't want to do this anymore. Come on. Don't let him see you. Shh. He won't. Oh my god. Damn it. I Know. OK? I know. I know. I have to tell you something. Can it wait until later? I haven't even finished a cup of coffee. Not really. I saw Uncle Ollie peeking into your room last night. Seriously? I think that might be why he's acting so weird, weird. Go out and play. You're not listening to me. He was standing in the hallway like a freaking weirdo, mom. I said go out an play. Mom? Now. We should just pack our things and get out of here. Hold on a sec. Are you kidding me? Hold on for what? Think about it for a minute. We're living rent free, right? So what. So we just need a little bit more time to get ourselves collected, back on our feet. The kids are fine. We're fine. We're fine. So what if the guy's a little weird? We have a good thing going here. We just have to make it through the summer, just the summer. Fine. But any more weird shit, and we are leaving. Deal. Hey, come over here. Maggie, come on. Look, I'm sorry. For what? For everything, for this farm, being a horrible mother. Take your pick. Look, I know Neil isn't perfect. But he cares about us, and he's trying. You're too young to really-- Mom, I'm not too young, OK? You are though. I just want you know everything's going to be OK. It's worth staying here? Yeah. For now. Mom? We can make it through the summer. Hey. Hey. Watch out for your sister for me, OK? She can be stubborn. Can you do that for me? I guess so. You guess so? You can. Guess So? I can't. You can. Go. That's a good boy. What the hell is this? Whoa. Jeez. Christ. I don't think we should stay here. I know. It's crazy. He chops up animals. It's a farm. I don't know. Maybe that's normal. Normal? You don't just chop off animals and listen to them scream. That's crazy. Let me think. OK? Watching mom sleep? That's cruel. I need time to think. All right? I'll figure it out. I'm afraid. I know. I'll take care of us. Only through the sacrifice of the young can the Earth and the old be one? What the hell does that mean? Jake, what about your dreams? I told you. My dreams don't mean anything. You know they do, all right? You dreamed about dad shooting himself before he did it. Jake, we could have told people. Stop! OK, I'll stop. I need you to listen to me, OK? And be very quiet and hide. I love you. Please, it's all going to be OK. No! It's all going to be OK. Go. Go on. Go. Go. Go. You don't have to do this. Stop! Stop! You're only going to terrify him. Take me, please. I'll do anything. Stop. You're just scaring her. Did you know that my great-great-great grandfather was one of the first From him, we get these rules we have to follow, always. Shut up! I'm sorry. We have to follow the rules. But I understand. The first born in any family is a gift straight from God. Yours is no exception. She's young, human, unaware of how life can be. Please, she's all I have. Please, please, don't take her, please. I would give them all away if I could. They're heroes. They're saving our land. I take no pleasure in this. Please? I'm going to do you a kindness. I'm begging you, please, please. please. Give her to me freely, willingly. If you do, I'll let you say your goodbyes. I'll let you tell her whatever story you want about the other side. And I'll make I can't! I can't let you take her. No! Mom! No! No! No! Mom! No! No! Mom! Do you hear that? I don't hear anything. Please? Sorry. in my heart. in my-- What's your favorite food again? I don't have one. Y'all still here? Where else would we be? As far away from here as you get. Yeah, I wish. In my veins. He has trouble in my.. You just don't know his You know, your mother-- she has a strong family resemblance. She reminds me so much of her great Aunt Rose. Rose? Yep. My great grandmother's sister. What's with all the racket? Come on, Uncle Ollie. We're just having some fun. She's been gone a long time now, but you can see the resemblance. Looks like you got a piece of her in you too. Yeah, I certainly hope not. Just don't know it yet. Anger is hatred And I have skeletons in my closet. I have skeletons in my closet. No. No. Wait. Wait. There isn't much time now. You have to get your mother to leave this place. saying that. Come on. I needed this. We'll be fine. I've already killed you. You just don't know-- --is murdered. --closet. I already killed you. You just don't know it yet. Anger is hatred, is murdered. And I have skeletons in my closet. What do you think he meant? I don't know. But we have to go back in that barn. Do we have to? We have to use the radio. It's the only way we're going to get any answers. Someone clean the closet out. Someone clean the closet out. Someone clean the closet out. Someone clean the closet out. Someone clean the closet. Hey, Uncle Ollie. Are you OK? I really just wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me, and the kids, and Neil. We really appreciate it. OK. Is something wrong? Did I do something to offend you? It's OK. Leave me alone. Are you sure? I don't mind listening. Maybe if you and-- Neil? Yeah, Neil, weren't so misguided and lazy. Misguided and lazy. What were you doing peeking in from my door? Just leave me be. So you don't deny it then? You're a guest in my home! And that just gives you the right to do whatever you want? It does. You're disgusting, you know that? You know nothing about the sacrifices that have been made for this land, for this family! You have two beautiful children! And look at the life you've chosen. Look what you've done to them. You chose to bring them here to this place! Why? Because their father killed himself. in this place alone. You better leave before I do something we both regret. Oh. Disgusting. I hate this place. It only works when you touch it. Ask for Rose. Rose, are you there? Jake? Jake, where-- where are you? We're in the barn. You should go. Ask if she knows who the woman in the photo was. What's her real name? I don't know. Ask if she has a sister. Rose, do you have a sister? Yes, they-- they sent me here. I don't want to be here. Rose, are you still here? Rose is gone now. Who is this? This is Gloria. Gloria, where are you? Shut up. Listen, stay out of the fields. Stay away from the people in town. Do you understand? I can't just leave. Get away from the farm now. Get as far away from that place as you can, and stay away from my father. Who's your father? Ollie. Neil, Neil! We have to go. I told you! He's just-- he's crazy. Where is it? What are you talking about, man? You get one chance. Where's the doll? That doll belongs to my daughter. Listen to me, I'll beat your skull if you don't back off. I'm ashamed of you, Ollie. You're allowing it to happen all over again. We agreed it would end. Get out. All of you, get out! I'm sick and tired of looking at you. I want you Gloria? Rose? What are we going to do? I don't know. Let me think. We'll figure it out. Grab clothes. Hurry. Something very bad is about to happen, Maggie. What? Ahhh! What's about to happen, Jake? We should run. Ahhh! No! No, please! Please. I didn't want this! OK! We don't want this either. This is what must be done! This is how it works here! I don't understand. This is how it works. You'll see. This is how it's always been done! And you need to be strong! You need to be part of this. Part of what? I don't understand. In order for this farm to survive, in order for this Earth and the old to be one, there must not be any young. You're not making any sense. Mom! Have you ever wondered why there are no children here? Time for you to do what you were meant to do. Jessica, it's meant to be yours. Ahhh! Mom, don't! Go take your brother and hide now! Not without you! OK. I'm right behind you. Go Now, go! Don't come any closer. Jessica, listen to me. Don't come any closer. This is how it's always been done here. I said stop! Auntie demands a sacrifice. Jake, hurry. Jake! Maggie! Maggie! Mom! Mom, we're here! Baby, are you OK? Jake, are you OK? This is-- this is the place. Stop, stop! No, don't. This is-- Baby, can you walk? We got to go. Baby, come on. It doesn't matter. We got to go. We got to go. Right here. OK. I can feel it. OK. It was like with Dad. OK, sweetie, run. Come on. You poor things. What happened? He went crazy. He just went crazy. He killed Neil. He tried to kill all of us. He just lost it. OK, here. Have a seat. He's in the woods. He is killing children in the woods. We saw it. I-- he killed my Aunt Rose. He killed your son, David. His own daughter, Gloria, too. How do you know all this? We just do. So, what else did you guys see? It's hard to explain the things he was saying. They didn't make any sense. Well, I think things are going to be OK. I'm really sorry about this. I'm truly sorry about this. I really am. You're insane! You'd be surprised the things a person can learn to live with, even horrible, horrible things. Try living with that! Don't even think about it, dear. No, no. No, no, no. No. Ollie. No, no, no, no. Ollie, please. Auntie demands a sacrifice. What you're doing is very brave. I don't want to. But you must. No, no, no, no, no, no! Daddy! Ollie, Ollie, Ollie! Be brave for me, OK? Daddy! Hi, baby. No-- Ollie, don't. Don't do it, Ollie. It's wrong. It has to be done. Honey-- It has to. It's our world. This is the way. It's our way. But B-- OK, for life. OK, OK. OK, sweetheart, bend down. There we go. No-- stop! No! I gave my child, and it took my wife anyway. I gave all your children, because that is the way. That is the way our people set before us. And we did as we were told. It's best they know. You're insane! And now, you're part of it. You wanted to stay here? You wanted to live here? Well, this is the way. We're not afraid of you. That's good. It's important that you be brave for your brother. Your blood and his make this soil fertile, it cleanse the water the only the way the ancient gods can. Let's just get it-- Shut up! You stand there and demand that we do this, well, this is how it's going to be done. So you shut up and do your part. Uncle Ollie, please, please don't hurt my babies. Your babies? These aren't your babies anymore. These are the children of our people. And they have a great purpose, greater than any life that you can ever give them. It's almost time now. I'm so sorry. Mom, we're going to be OK, OK? Wait. We're going to be OK. No, no, no, no. Don't do it. Ollie, please don't. I'm so sorry. It's OK, baby. Listen to Mommy. Mom, we're going to be OK. No! What? I told you. I would never let this go on. You can't stop this. This will never end, and you know it. Come here, come on. This is not the way. No, please no. Please. This is our way. This is our way. This is our world. It's for love. It's for our family. Honey, no. It has to be done. Honey, I want to go home. Honey, I-- Daddy! I love you! But we can find a new way. Ollie, don't shoot. Ollie, please don't. Ah! Ah! Daddy! Yes, honey, I'm here. I-- I'm OK. I'm OK, I'm OK. I love you. I love you! Honey, I love you. I love you. Daddy loves you. Anger rages in my heart. Murder dwells in my mind. I won't forgive you. You are my prey. So watch out when you go out tonight. A wolverine in my veins, the eyes of a wolf in my head. I've thought it, so I've done it. My despising heart makes you dead. I've already killed you. You just don't know it yet. Anger is hatred, is murder. But I have skeletons in my closet. I have skeletons in my closet. I have skeletons in my closet. I have skeletons in my closet. My vision is infrared, carving your flesh with a knife. No one needs to know that I collect bones. I have skinned you alive. I've already killed you. You just don't know it yet. Anger is hatred, is murder. But I have skeletons in my closet. I have skeletons in my closet. I have skeletons in my closet. I have skeletons in my closet.
