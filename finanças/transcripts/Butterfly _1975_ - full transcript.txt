Don't you love your Freddy anymore? - Sure. Fred. I love you. - What's wrong? Have I done something? - Perhaps I'm bored. - Why are you bored? - It isn't that you bore me. You're the only exciting thing around here. - Well, what is it then? - It's this place, this damn village. And its damn narrow minded people. It's the farm. It's my aunt. It's, it's everything. - Your aunt is a very kind woman and she loves you very much. - I don't want to end up like her, harnessed to a farm like an old plow horse. (Water spraying) - Why did you not tell me you were leaving this afternoon? You finished all your work, I suppose. - I collect the eggs now. - They are collected already. You are going to clean the duck pen today. What's the matter with you lately? We all have our jobs to do. After they are done, we can relax. After they are done, it's dark. Before they begin, it's dark. (Dog barking) (Dog barking) - Don't you want to eat? - No. - I wish you would be as interested in your daily work as you are in these magazines. Lately you are getting stranger and stranger. What's the matter with you? Let's talk about it. - I want more outta life than a farm can offer. - I understand you're better than you may think. But the farm is all that we have got. That's the way we make our living. Come on, let's eat. - Okay, I come down if I can have a Norwegian filet mignon and champagne. - I'm afraid I only can offer you the pizza from yesterday. - In that case, I'm not really hungry. (Soft upbeat music) (Upbeat music) (Upbeat music continues) (Upbeat music continues) (Upbeat music continues) Fred. (Dog barking) Fred! (Rocks clattering) - Shhh. (Door creaking) (Soft upbeat music) (Soft upbeat music continues) (Soft upbeat music continues) (Soft upbeat music continues) (Soft upbeat music continues) (Soft upbeat music continues) - Let's run away to Munich. - What? - I said let's go to Munich. Let's have some fun there. I'm bored here. - I can't. I have to finish school. - You and your school. Last offer. You want to come along? - (Laughing) Don't be silly, darling. Hey, get dressed now. I'll see you tomorrow. (Change clattering) - [Denise voiceover] Dear auntie. It is not because of you that I'm leaving. I know that you mean well. I must find out what lies on the other side of our fields. I'll be in touch with you as soon as I'm settled in Munich. Don't worry. I love you. Yours, Denise. (Soft upbeat music) (Soft upbeat music continues) (Engine revving) (Tires screeching) (Engine revving) (Birds chirping) (Door clicking) (Engine revving) (Birds chirping) (Tires screeching) (Engine revving) (Engine revving) - What's a pretty girl like you doing out on the road? - I'm going to Munich. - Ah. Are you visiting relatives there? - [Denise] No. - What are you going to do when you get to the city? - I'm going to be a model, like this girl. - Oh, it's a fashion model. (Breathing heavily) Here is my card. I was in fashion. Ladies underwear, that is. I may be able to set you up in the city. I know a lot of people. You have the right figure for modeling. - Oh, do you really think so? - Oh yes. Perfect for ladies underwear. Perhaps, perhaps I could get a look at your legs. A little higher, please. You were not afraid a little while ago on the road. - [Denise] Oh watch out. (Man gasping) That was a close one. - Don't worry. I had it under control all the time. I'm quite an experienced driver. - Now, what was it you were saying about my modeling career? - Oh yes, of course. Actually, my firm employs many young women models. - What kind of things would I model? - Well, I have samples in the back. (Birds chirping) (Birds chirping) - Okay, let's take a look at what you've got. (Laughing) What is this stuff? - This is fashion, ladies underwear. - I'm not used to underwear. I've never worn any. - Yes. So I noticed. - Perhaps that's why I didn't recognize it. - Well, we have to get you used to the finer things in life. Hey, wait a minute. What are you doing? - I just want to try on some of your finer things in life. - Oh, yes, but not here. Somebody might get the wrong ideas. Let's move over there, into the bushes. (Birds chirping) Yes. (Denise laughing) (Denise laughing) - Let me model this for you. - I never mind you modeling now. Let's try another one. (Gasping) (Denise laughing) (Birds chirping) (Man breathing heavily) (Birds chirping) - Hey, haven't you ever seen a car before, huh? - Yes. But nothing like this. This must be a very expensive one. By the way, what are you doing here? - Taking a nap. I had a rough night. - May I take a look inside? - Sure. By any chance, was that your ride? Where you headed? - To Munich. - Isn't that a coincidence? So am I. Get in. (Birds chirping) (Engine starting) (Engine revving) (Engine revving) (Engine starting) (Birds chirping) Hi Marina. I'd like you to meet Denise. I hope you understood what I said on the telephone. Denise is new in town. She needs somebody to look after her for a while, eh? - Who the hell is she? - Did Krista ask who you were when I brought you? - Well, I'm not Krista. - Mm. - Anyway, times were different then. - Yeah. Well, who knows, eh? (Laughing) Where did you get that stuff? - The man I told you about. The lady's underwear salesman. He gave it to me. - Here's a fresh towel. (Laughing) (Denise moaning) (Upbeat funk music) ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ you will sing my song ♪ ♪ sing it to you all night long ♪ ♪ come on over, stay with me ♪ ♪ I just wanna set you free ♪ (Upbeat funk music continues) - How's it going? - I think that we will have a good night. - Huh? (Upbeat funk music continues) - Someone buy a hardworking girl a drink? - Sure. What have you been doing lately? - Not much. Just waiting for an invitation. (Upbeat funk music continues) - I've been waiting for you. - Get me a drink. Had a very good night at the club. (Birds chirping) - You lousy tramp. - [Denise] And you're not a tramp? - Oh, don't be so self-satisfied. After frank finished screwing you, he made love to me. Just don't get too comfortable here. As soon as frank sets sights on a new lady that makes his juices flow, you'll be out like a whole string of girls before us. (Fingers snapping) - Listen, I've had enough of your nagging. Take your things and get outta here. - Go to hell. - Pretty one, pour me some tea? - Fuck. (Door slamming) - She just closed that door behind her for good. (Birds chirping) Hi Ruth. Business was good last night, huh? Mm-hmm. Hey, I've got a little refugee here. I'd like you to do some shopping with her. (Birds chirping) - This. This covers your figure very well, don't you think so? - Yeah, gorgeous. - You like it? - Okay. - Okay, come on. - Hello? - Hello. - I'm glad you could make it. You did a good job last night. Everybody liked it. - Yes, I told you I can dance. I believe I can do a few other things too. - Oh. That sounds interesting. - And now big boss, for great dancing last night, where's the reward you promised me? - You'll get it soon enough. - I bet you have a lot of traffic in this pad. Female traffic, I mean. - I do my best. - And I bet that I'm the only one realizes that I only can have you by imitation. (Frank chuckling) - You are right. Frank is an exciting man. I love him very much. - But you said- - I said that, that I'm not one of his girlfriends. I love him in a different way perhaps than you do. - How do you know what I feel for him? Hi. Ruth is an angel. Look what she bought for me. Did you have company? - This is Winnie, our dancer from the club. Show us what you bought. - Take me to your club tonight and I'll wear it. (Upbeat music) - Hey. She's beautiful, huh? You did a good job. (Upbeat music continues) (Soft upbeat music) (Soft upbeat music continues) (Soft upbeat music continues) (Soft upbeat music continues) (Soft upbeat music continues) (Upbeat music) (Upbeat music continues) (Soft upbeat music) Gonna buy another club. - Maybe more money. I don't know. But I think it's so difficult. (All chattering) (Upbeat music) Natasha, this is frank. - I have heard quite a lot about you from Ruth. - [Frank] I hope it was good. - Of course it was good. (Indistinct) - All right, all right. - Denise, please, would you give me a hand? - Pretty girl. - Yes, she is. How about a dance? - I would like something else better, but of course we can start with a dance. (Upbeat music) - She's a pretty girl. - You mean Natasha? Yes. One can say she's a pretty girl. - You're not so enthusiastic. - Well, Natasha isn't exactly my type. - You like a special type of girl? - Yes, I like a special type of girl. (Indistinct) (Upbeat music continues) (Upbeat music continues) - [Frank] Wait a minute, wait a minute. - I can wait a minute. - Look, this is my place of business. I've gotta be careful. - Your minute is almost up. (Upbeat music continues) How was that, hmmm? (Upbeat music continues) (Upbeat music continues) (Both moaning) - Frank, how about a movie this afternoon? - I'd love to, but I have an appointment. Why don't you call Ruth? Maybe she'd like to go along with you. - I'll call up Ruth. - Now that's my little place. Sit down. I'll fix us a drink, hmm? (Doorbell ringing) (Both speaking foreign language) - Am I pretty? - Of course, you're pretty. - Am I really as pretty as Natasha? - You are very pretty. (Both moaning) (Soft upbeat music) (Engine starting) - Boy, what a meeting. - Who was the meeting with? - Ah, some guy. You wouldn't know him. - You son of a bitch. You just made love to that girl and now you have the guts to lie straight into my face. You must think that I'm just a stupid country girl you picked up on the road so you can have some fun with her. - Shut up. - Marina was right, wasn't she? This always happens, doesn't it? You just use them and then you throw them away. (Gasping) (Upbeat music) (Upbeat music continues) - Good evening, Mr. Clauson and Ms. Harlet? - Come on, darling. I'll ask Ruth to take you home, huh? - You want me home sleeping so you can screw this harlet. - Ruth. (Upbeat music continues) - Ruth, Ruth. She does everything for you, doesn't she? She buy clothes for you girls when you don't have time. She makes love to them when you don't want to. And she tucks them into bed. When you want to screw somebody else. - Get her outta here. (Denise gasping) - Who is your next lay? Is she in this room already? I bet she's in this room already. Which one of you is it? Who is going to be his next lay? - Get her a cab! - Turn on the goddamn music. (Upbeat music) (Denise sobbing) (Upbeat music continues) - I bet you can be very violent. (Cork popping) - Stupid bitch. (Upbeat music continues) (Birds chirping) (Somber music) (Both laughing) You still here? - But not for long. - Darling, I have a few things to do. I have to run. - See you later. - And these, perhaps you can give these to the next harlet so Ruth won't have to waste her time shopping for her. (Door clicking) (Door slamming) (Phone ringing) - The service club. - Ruth, where's Natasha? She was supposed to meet me here hours ago. - Don't you know, she takes 11 o'clock plane home. - What? That's impossible. - Sure, that's possible. Natasha always does things like this. - But I thought she was gonna stay in town for a while. - Is that what she told you? - Well, there'll always be another one. (Frank laughing) What are we celebrating? - This invitation. ♪ Baby child ♪ ♪ baby child ♪ ♪ baby child ♪ ♪ goodbye ♪ ♪ baby child ♪ ♪ baby child ♪ ♪ baby child ♪ ♪ goodbye ♪ ♪ baby child ♪ ♪ baby child ♪ ♪ baby child ♪ ♪ goodbye ♪
