'Oh My Kadavule' [Oh My God] (HUMS A SONG) Hey! Noodle-Head! Why are you so dull? Nothing, Arjun! Aye! What? Oye! Mani has come. Hi Noodle-head! - Dude!!! - Dude!!! Idiot! You hardly come to meet us after you got married... ...and you still come late! I am late because I got married. Only married men will understand how tough it is to meet friends after marriage. You will never understand. You should be happy I am here. Get lost! You need to take so much pain to meet us, leave now. Are you insulting me, Arjun? You call me to drink and abuse me? I am leaving! What was that? Liquor is more important. (IMITATES CARNATIC MUSIC) But dude... How did you ever clear Thermodynamics paper? I thought you will clear it in the next century. And she taught you! That's an achievement dude! We need to celebrate this. - Huh? - Yes! Feels like a Nannari Sarbat (Native colored Soda) Hey Anu! Make it fast no! Cheers! (CHORUS) (PHONE RINGS) Oh that's the witch! Baby! You've gone to drink with your friends right? I swear I am not drinking baby. Hey! Come here, I will blow and prove you wrong. OK, send me the location and I'll be there. Send no? OK leave it. I'll come there and blow! Right! Babababa Baby! Oye oye oye! - Bye Bye Bye baby! (KISSES) - Come home, I will kill you. Bye baby! Oh lord! Dude! Don't you think baby-ing her is getting a bit too much? She's my wife and I call her that! What's your problem? Why do you have to be so cheesy for this arranged marriage affair? Oh! So arranged marriage is so easy for you guys? Being in a relationship for 4-5 years, getting married and then having fun in bed... ...is nothing in front of getting married to a stranger and expecting ...and accepting to do the same on the very first day. Not even closer dude! Arranged marriage is more fun dude! You will come into my category one day. No way! There's no chance I will marry a stranger. - Too much confidence! - Get lost! Hey, let's see dude! You will be trapped buddy! You will be trapped and I will see it. Arjun? - Hmmm? Shall we get married? (BOTTLE BREAKS) Huh? Arjun? Huh? Uhhh... Aren't you Arjun? Yes! You? Meera, your school senior! Have you forgotten me? Meera Akka (Elder Sister)! Akka? I am just 2 years elder than you. It's been so long! The last time we met was in our school annual day function. After that you changed schools in 7th grade no? Yes! Father got transferred to Kerala, so we had to move. Meera! Just a minute. OK da, I have to leave. We'll catch up later. - Bye! - OK! Here I come! Hey, don't forget to add me on facebook. OK? Meera Akka? Hug for me? Akka! Missed Akka's hug! Thanks Bro! Do you have anyone else left to hug? Huh? I asked you "Shall we get married?" ...you're doing something else comfortably ignoring it. Hey! We're friends dude! Don't be kidding. He's also my friend, I don't feel that way towards him. Hey! I am married dude! Does that make a difference? Get lost! You get lost! His name is Matthew. Age: 28, Doctor. That's all I know about him. For the past 10 days dad has been asking me to marry this fellow. I was a bit confused. You just said right? That you can't marry a stranger. That's when I suddenly felt. So asked it off. Give it to me. Let's see that face. Hmmm! I thought he'll look like a duffer. Much better. He looks much better than I thought. Hmmm! Give it back. Think for a while... ...and let me know if you're OK! OK? Hey! Anu! Oh Lord! Hey! Anu! Dude, pay the bill and go home. Huh? Dude! Why should I pay for your treat? Anu! Anna (Big brother), please wait a minute. Let's go bro! "There is no age for friendship, said a saint." - I just beat you! - Why are you screaming? "There is no separation for true friendship, he said." Noodle-Head! "Almost, from the age of wearing diaper we walked shoulder to shoulder." "By doing boxing & fight, by singing 'mustafa' together, we grew up." Hey Noodle-Head! Who's she dude? Huh? Meera Akka! Sixth standard! Though she's an Akka... She looks beautiful no? Yes dude! "Friendship is our wealth... Friendship is our wealth..." - Happy B'day! - Thank you Anu, where's your mother? "Friendship is our wealth..." "Even if thousand other relations come, friend is our power." Arjun, you acted well. Akka, you were a good storyteller too. Okay, bye "Bunking college we went to 'thala Ajith's' movie." "In spite of copying in exam, we failed." "We'll share property, but we'll never share 'samosa'." Arjun!, after the semester gets over, can we go on a road trip? In the bike! How will Mani come if we go on a Bike? Crack! Let's go in a car. "Friendship is our wealth... Friendship is our wealth..." "Friendship is our wealth..." "Even if thousand other relations come, friend is our power." - Cheers! - Cheers! - What the hell is this? - Ewww! We shouldn't be coming here dude! "There is no age for friendship, said a saint." Oh, Love pops out in the last minute and... ...she will throw off everything and run off. What kind of logic is this? Love has no logic you Noodle-Head. It's all Magic. "We smoked secretly. We ogled together. We roamed around together in bike." "Talking aimlessly on terrace, we'll spend years together." Victory! Victory! There is no space for any other motto in this Ashokan's life. "There has never been any hypocrisy between us." (CROWD CHEERS & APPLAUSE) Oh these heels! Hey! What are you doing here? You seemed lonely standing here. That's why I came. Nothing like that. You think I can't figure out looking at your face? Dude! How's it? Is it looking good? You want to wear it? I'll give you tomorrow? Why do you keep making dosas everyday mom? You'll crave for this dosa after you get married. I'll remind you then. First clear off your arrears and get a life. Stop whining about your dosas. Aunty, Can I get an egg-dosa? "Friendship is our wealth..." Shall we get married? Arjun! Arjun! Why are you smiling? I had a good dream. Anu! I gave it a thought. I don't have a reason to say "NO" to you. What do you mean? I don't get it. I mean, I want to marry you. Hey! You're not blabbering because you're high right? I make more sense when I'm high dude. Sir! Please move aside and talk no? Welcome dude! Hasn't Anu come yet? How's Swathi? Huh? Good! Your son? Good! What name have you thought of for him? Hey idiot! Sorry sir! Is that of so much concern now? Hey dude! I feel you both are very impulsive with this decision of divorce. Decision to marry her was impulsive, and that's why I'm here. Crack pot! Dude! Please dude! If you guys open up to each other... Dude! This won't work out dude. That's it. Just leave it there. Hey! Come in madam. Please give some space no? Move move! You have a seat madam. Dude! Huh? Why are you going there? She's also my friend dude. Greetings! Please sit down. What's the first case? Hey Thambi (baby brother)! I'm talking to you Mr. Blue shirt. What? Your friend is trying so hard to make you get back to your wife? Huh? Yov! Who're you? What do you want? Arjun Marimuthu! Let's discuss what I want later. First of all you think you will get a divorce in this court today? Huh? She's here right? (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY) (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY) Hey! How do you know my name? Not just your name... ...I know everything that's going to happen in this court for the next 15 minutes. Shall I tell you? You want to listen? In 2 minutes a guy will read out "Case no 23314 Arjun Marimuthu-Anu Paulraj"... ...you both will stand in front of the judge. The judge will ask your concern in this divorce... ...and you will give your concern. She will ask the same question to your wife and... ...when she is about to answer, she will faint. Your friend will run in out of panic... ...and a constable will call 108 for ambulance. A lawyer will splash water on your wife's face... ...and in the next 2 minutes the ambulance arrives. In spite of she being hesitant, your friend takes her in the ambulance and... ...looking at all this the judge postpones your case to evening 4 PM. When you come back at 4 PM... You won't get the divorce. Huh! Get lost you crack. (LAUGHS) How can an ambulance come in 2 minutes for the intensity of the traffic in our city? Whatever this crack tells will happen for sure Thambi. You will have this fear, if you will get a divorce or not. I won't fear. What if you get the fear? Come to the address. My boss will get you divorce. Case no. 23314 Arjun Marimuthu-Anu Paulraj. Do we have your concern in this divorce? I approve madam. Do we have your consent too? Oh lord! Check what happened! Anu! Anu! Hello 108? Madam! Wake up madam! What will I answer to your dad? Someone check if the ambulance has arrived. - Move aside! - Give me some way! Move aside no? This case is postponed to 4:00 PM. Huh? You're all right, no? So... You will come back at 4 PM to sign the divorce right? Hey! Senseless... These are the kind we land up on! Huh! You will fear if you will get your divorce or not. If you get that fear... This is the place. This abandoned place is named Love court? Abandoned? Can't you see such a big building? Building? So high in the morning? Heat is eating up your senses or what? Yov! I'm so high... ...and you're so sober and clear. Give me the money. Be careful dude. Morons in the morning! Love court and shuttle court! (DOOR KNOCK) Hey Arjun! Welcome! So do you feel the fear now? I told you, you'd come. Yov! Who're you? How do you know everything that was going to happen? What is this Love Court? Why did you plan and trap me? How dare you laugh when I'm talking to you. Answer me. Boss! Boss! Ahhh! Arrghh! Ahhh! Coming! Ahhh! Ahhhh! Hey! Hi Arjun! Ahhhh! How're you? Huh? How's the court going? Huh? Sir! Who are you sir? You're creating a drama in my life. Huh huhhuh? Who are you sir? Why are you playing around in my life? Wait a second! Hey bring that phone no? Phone is there, you can go and take it, go! Pull out that chair and sit down. For what? You sit down, I will tell you. Sit down baby! Relax! Relax? I'm confused as to who you are and what this place is. How do you expect me to be relaxed? (LAUGHS) OK! I will answer all your questions. But more important is... ...believe me, I will get you the divorce you want. Who? You? Hmm-hmm! Don't be kidding sir. Hey-Hey! Customer is going, won't you stop him? Huh? What's this Arjun? Don't be so impatient. Your impatience has made you come and stand here. Be patient. Anu! Why do you want to divorce her? Tell me the reason... ...I will get you the divorce. Don't think about time boss. There is nothing called time. Even if it's there, my boss will clear this case before your time 03:00 PM. Arjun Marimuthu... Anu... Paulraj! Paulraj! Love marriage? Love after marriage? What? Not a love marriage, no love after marriage... ...then what the hell is this? A love marriage without love sir. Boss, he's trying to confuse us boss. A best friend from my childhood asked me out for marriage. I said "YES" because I had no reason to say "NO" But there wasn't any love in this sir. Oh...so this is love marriage without love. OK OK! So you didn't have love right? Isn't a good reason to say "NO"? You could've told that and escaped no? This is the problem with our guys. They keep saying "YES" when they're not supposed to... ...then regret all through the life for that "YES" Don't you have any sense? Daily before we sleep, we use to talk to each other on phone. After marriage, it's going to be the same friend on the same bed. That's all right? What's there in this? That's why I said OK sir. But after marriage only did I know... ...that it's a blunder. Why? People are craving to get a wife who is a friend. You've got a friend as a wife. Shouldn't you be celebrating? Dog! What Arjun? Crackpot! You can look at your wife as a friend. But a looking at a friend as a wife... You can never do that. Ask me! I will tell you a bunch of stories. So, you both decided to get married right? How did you convince at your homes? Since it's a inter-caste marriage, they will oppose no? The next day they came home sir. Both dad and daughter. Mom! Haan Arjun, come come come! Did we spoil your sleep? Go wash your face and come. We will discuss your wedding with Anu. Did you say you will marry Anu? What are you thinking? Tell me! Yes dad! You said she's just friend? Even now she's a friend dad! (LAUGHS) Sir! How sir? What how? How sir? (STRESSES) That's what I'm asking, what are you talking about? How did you accept to give away your daughter to this fellow? Sorry dude! Sir! I know Arjun since his childhood. I'm sure he will take care of my daughter really well. What else do I need to think about? Sir are you... Are you worried that we're Christians? Oh no, I don't care about those things sir. Then what sir? Sir, he's been a duffer for the past two years. He's not employed. He just cleared his arrears. Sir! So it's that thing that bothers you? Instead of Arjun working in some random company, just like my daughter he can work in my company itself. They're the ones who have to take care of my company after me right? What do you say Arjun? That... Why do you even ask him sir? You are offering your daughter and a job for him. You've a generous heart sir. So when can we have the wedding sir? We can have it immediately. - Yov! - Hmmm! Your father-in-law is a gold man. Who? - My father-in-law? - Yes! Listen to my full story first! To avoid confusion of, if it's going to be a church wedding or a temple wedding... ...we instead did it in a registrar office. But reception in a 5 star hotel... ...A beach facing apartment on the 14th floor as a wedding gift. Life...was pretty good sir. OK OK, come to the matter. Sir? Come to the point dude! Here I come sir. (GIGGLES) What happened? Nothing nothing! One minute! (GIGGLES) Why are you giggling? Well... I have seen you as a friend from my childhood! All of a sudden, being asked to be romantic with you in a closed room... ...I'm not able to get into that mood. ...That's why I'm giggling. What about you? Let's not force it. Let it happen organically. Are you sure? Sure. We can actually postpone our honeymoon as well. Damn tragedy! Brother! Well...Ummm! We've been friends for so long no... Suddenly looking at her that way is kind of... ...uhhh! ...I felt it was very cheap. - Do you get what I'm saying? - Yes I do I do! So... The girl being his friend is the primary issue. OK, go ahead! Even without romance, the first 3 weeks were very good. Maaa! (SHOUTS IN PANIC) (WHISTLES A SONG) Hey! Where's my space? Here, in this corner. "Now a chapter has started in our book." "Wardrobe is too small. That is the real problem." "All this is not a matter. Even if I know that..." Who are you? Oh, Hey Arjun...Oh My God! "We'll drop bomb all over." "Even then, we'll lead a super life." Now I understand the value of my Mother's dosa. Is this even a Dosa? Arjun! (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY) "We'll daily have a fight." Hey! Noodle-Head! Prank in the morning! Uff! (EERIE LAUGHTER) "Even then, we'll lead a super life." "Cast away the spell of evil eye." Grandpa, this is not our house. Sorry Anna (Elder Brother)! My grandpa has dementia. - Arjun please Arjun! - Go to hell! Oh my hair! No! '- That's why I am in abscond - Abscond?' Just a minute dad! Arjun! Dad is asking you to come to office from Monday! You're OK with it right? Wait and watch the game of KAALI! Hey! Answer me. - Okay - He says OK dad. Don't disturb me Anu, I want to win Mani. It's OK! Uhhh! Hi! Who's she? She's Noodles-Head, my friend! Hey! Uh...Wife! YES! You did it with Mani? Eh ha eh ha! "That is the big issue." (GIGGLES) Do you also have dementia just like my grandpa? Take that on your face! Go to hell! Take the coffee! I'll kill you! What the hell is happening here? "Even then, we'll lead a super life." "Cast away the spell of evil eye." When are you going to behave like Husband-Wife? Did you do it with Mani at last? Hmmm? Is it a double meaning or a single one? Just a single meaning sir. OK, what happened after 3 weeks? I joined my Father-in-law's company. What was the job? Why do you have to wear a tie to the office? Hey Noodle-Head! This is the first time I'm going for a work. Going like this will create a "SWAG VIBE" in front of uncle right? Hey! Where is the office? This is the office. - This one? - Yes, come. Hey! Why do you have western closets here? Shouldn't it be inside? Arjun! These are our company products. Didn't you say ceramics? Toiletries are also ceramics. Haven't you read about this in school? No! Come! - Good Morning Ma'am! - Good Morning. Hey Anu! How can you just leave me and go? Let me know what my job is. Sorry! One second! - Huh, Teslyn! - Yes ma'am! Take him to dad. OK ma'am. Dad will let you know about your job, OK? All the best! - OK!- Bye! Excuse me sir! We should make sure the leg doesn't slip while sitting on this. Hey Arjun, come. Come here no? Jesus! Sit! Huh? Sit down no? You mean here? Yes, on that, sit now. Remove your bag. Remove it. Hmmm, sit now. Sit properly. Sit properly no? - Is the height OK? - OK! Huh, Comfort? OK? Uncle? Grip? It isn't slipping right? - In the front side? - Uncle! What are you doing uncle? This is the only place where a human sits in peace. In that case, we have to check comfort and quality no? From now on you'll be doing that job, what's the job called? Quality check controller sir. Ya the same. Uncle, how can I do all this? Hey! I've been doing this for the past 20 years. Now your Uncle is ageing. I'm not able to sit because of the knee pain. That's why I'm asking you to take over. Huh? All the best! Son! We should give the best quality product to our customers. We should like the quality of that product first, understood? - Take care. - OK sir. (LAUGHS) Hey! You guys find my plight funny is it? (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY) No dude, the way you feel about it funny actually. "Alarm is ringing in the ear. I get up from the bed in a drunken state." "Even inside toilet, 'to do' list is going on in the mind." "This life is boring." "Serving & eating breakfast in a hurry, after fighting & kick starting the bike..." "Entering one way in a wrong mode & getting abused..." "This life is boring." "O what kind of life is this! O what kind of life is this!" "O what kind of life is this! It has got stuck and halted." "O what kind of life is this!" - Hey Noodles-Head! - Hmmm! This job is very boring for me. I don't think this will work for me. The work will be boring for everyone on their first day Arjun. Then you'll get used to it. (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY) OK, OK, OKAY! OK. So you got used to it Arjun? Yes I got used to it. Got too much used to it. Imagine how it'd be if this is your job for 6 months. "By calling inside the cabin, the boss rebuked." "Even if he insults, I smile in a calm manner." "Health is gone, BMI pleads." "Where is the wealth? EMI is increasing." "9 to 6 life. Irritating wife." "Both are the same. I'm a waste bun." "O what kind of life is this!" "O what kind of life is this! O what kind of life is this!" "It has got stuck and halted." "O what kind of life is this! O what kind of life is this!" "To get freedom, break this cycle." (SCREAMS) It's extremely boring. It is right? Think of my plight. Even if it's my favorite teacher, I would walk out of the class if it's boring. Nine hours a day... ...all you've to do is sit down and stand up. That too in a western closet. How do you think it will feel? I'm not liking it. Not able to throw it off too. You ask why? Commitment! OK, come let's sit and discuss. No, I'll stand. All that is fine... ...did you at least say "NO" to your wife for this? For what? You've been doing this "SITING IN CLOSET" job for 6 months no? You don't like it right? You could've said "NO" to your wife for this job right? Already I haven't done anything sir. If I say "NO" to this... She'll feel bad no sir? Yes, you are right. Then what else did you do? I synced myself to a life timeline that was not in sync. Not good! Excuse me sir! Some girl has come here seeking a help sir, Shall I send her in? - Hmmm! - Ok, sir - Hey! - Hmmm! - Sit in that. - Hmmm! - Tomorrow we're getting some load from Pune.- Haan! - Check all of that properly. - OK, uncle. Whatever issue Is there, we need to return it immediately.- Arjun? Meera! You already know her? I know her uncle. Then help her out with whatever help she wants... ...I have a meeting. What are you doing here? Please don't ask me anything. Please let me know what help you need. Arjun, I'm working as an assistant to director Goutham Menon! Really? Hmmm! We're trying to find a similar location for Sir's next movie... It's a 6 day shoot... ...I was wondering if we could get permission for it. What do you mean 6 days, you can take it for 60 days. This is my company. - Your company? - Yes! Well I mean... My father-in law's company... ...but don't worry, I'll take care. Hey! You got married? Hmm-Hmm! How many shocks are you planning to give in a day? Anyways, thanks for the help. Thanks to you. I'm extremely bored here. It'll be fun to have a shooting here. That's all? OK, uh...Give me your phone number. I will confirm everything and give you a call in the evening. - Sure! - Hmmm? - 98410... - 98410... - 22... - 22... - 485... - 4, 8 5! - Ya! - OKAY! Who's this Meera? School senior sir. Hmmm? Childhood crush sir. Blushes all over! How did Meera photo come here? Case study! You go ahead! Meera! Well she was in my office... Don't start off like Goutham Menon, just go! Packaging is in the upstairs... Godown is in the downstairs. - OKAY! - This is the office cabin. You can shoot wherever you want. But Meera, I never expected to meet you again. The last time we met, I asked you to add me on facebook... -...you never added me. - Sorry! I'll add now. - Hmmm? - OKAY! - I'll take leave. - Bye. Bye! Arjun! Hey! Who was that? She looks familiar. It's Meera, our school senior? Uh...we met her in the pub the other day? You forgot her, crackpot! Uh...the one whom you called Akka? That was back then, now I called her Meera only. OK, so what was she doing here? Well, she came here to ask permission for shooting! - Shooting? - Haan! What did you say? I said OK! What? I said OK... - You said OKAY? Where will we work if we give away the office for shooting Arjun? Don't you think at all? Hey Anu! Don't scream! First of all, whom did you ask before saying OK? Uncle asked me to help her with whatever she wants. My dad? What happened Anu? Dad, did you give permission for a film shooting? No dear! Well! You asked me to help her with whatever she wants, uncle? Yes Arjun! But shouldn't you be knowing our work will be disturbed if we permit film shooting here? Huh? OK uncle! I will call her and say it's not possible. Hello! Yes tell me! (SNEEZES) - Sit down! - Sir! How can I sit in your chair? No one has a permanent chair Arjun! Sit down! Sit! - I feel...- My table is shabby, why haven't you cleaned it up? Sir, it's your table sir, you should've cleaned it up. You keep getting your work done from others! Ok...oK Come...come! - You wanted to ask him something no? - Ask him! I somehow feel... Dude, don't show the anger you have on me to him, he's our customer. I feel your wife wasn't angry because you said OK for the shooting. I think it's because of this Meera in your life again. I'm sure it's because of that. Thambi, looks like you are waiting for someone from a very long time? Hmmm! Yes bro! Hi Meera! Hi da! - Just a minute! - OKAY! 3 of this is enough! Thanks Akka Note it down. Okay! What's up da? You wanted to talk something? What happened? - Meera! - Hmmm! I just... ...took it for granted like it was my company and said OK for the shooting. But uh... My uncle and my wife are... ...not OK with it. So... It's OK! You could've told me about this on phone. No! I felt I should apologize to you in person. So...! Sorry Meera! It's OK, da! If I keep searching for a couple of days... ...I will get the location. Meera akka they're going to start the movie aren't you coming? I will come you go. - OK OK come soon. - Yes I'll be there. Arjun? You want to join us for the movie? Where? 'This is dinner room for eating' 'This is bath room' This place is so good Meera! - Ya right? - Yes! I have a dream of watching a movie here all alone. 'You will teach as...' But it's always a little crowded here. 'This is bedroom You simply said that' 'You didn't tell what it is used for' Meera! How did you get the interest to work in cinemas? Since my childhood I've always liked storytelling Arjun! Back in school and college... ...I used to direct dramas and... ...the same way we used to get applause. That's when I decided I wanted to become a director. Later I thought I'll give it a shot... ...and I'm giving it now. Even when I used to get applause after a stage performance in school or college no? Hmmm! That's when I started getting this small dream of becoming an actor. - Really? - Hmmm! Have you ever tried attending an audition? I wish... ...but I haven't tried any. Why? I don't know Meera! Middle class family! If I ever go and tell my father that I want to act in movies... ...thinking of his reaction itself scares out of me. Hey Hi! Hi! Where were you Arjun? Why are you late? I went to meet Meera! For what? FOR WHAT? Your company denied permission for shooting right? So I went to apologize to her. You could've called her on phone and said that right? Hey! I felt I should meet her in person and say that so I did it. Should I ask permission to you and your dad for this? Don't scream Arjun! Didn't I ask you not to scream in the office? Did you listen to me? Did you listen? Suspicion? You should suspect only if she doesn't suspect. Otherwise suspicion is very common. Huh? Nothing you proceed. What else sir... The next one week she didn't even talk to me properly. How did you know that I was working in toilets cleaning company? Truly was you working in toilets cleaning company? Hey! Why did you change the channel? 'So I blabbered you?' I don't like this song. You like all of A.R.Rahman songs right? I don't like this particular A.R.Rahman song. Is that clear? 'It was something different' I was handling building contract profession Don't ruin my respect and profession as well Take your hands off Were you washing for camels? It's so stinking - Step back - Why are you torturing me? Tell me what is this Hey! - Dude!!! - Hey! Hey Hey! Hey Mani! Dude! I've become a Mother now dude! Huh?

Nothing happened between you both? Dude! Your nerves are OK right? Why don't you come to Doctor? Damn it! Then? I'm not able to see our Noodle-Head as my wife dude. On top of that she's suspecting me. Suspecting you? Why? Huh! Dude! She's feeling very insecure. I think that's why she's suspecting you. If everything happens between you both no? Then she'll become normal. You should take the initiative dude. Where's he looking at? Dude you get it? You need to take initiative. Hey! Dude! You should be taking the initiative. You get it? Who the hell is that?! Sir, I tried with utmost sincerity. We got a call at the wrong timing sir. Oh so you got a call from Meera at the wrong timing? Is it OK if she calls when Your wife Is not around? Huh? Bro! When it comes to romance... ...you've to do it in a cute and flavored manner. Here take it! It shouldn't sound like a favor like this. Get lost you dust bin! Hello! Where's the drop brother? Uh...Royapuram. Royapuram... How to go to Royapuram brother? Hey! You're driving a cab in Chennai... ...don't you even know Royapuram? Don't get angry brother. It's been just a week since I came to this city. OK, go I'll tell you. Thanks brother. Go straight for 2 KM and take a left in the junction. Sorry brother that was...

Why are you smiling brother? Nothing but... A friend of mine works in the movies... I told her I'm interested in acting. I haven't tried anything so far. Now all of a sudden she calls me up for an audition. Then go and give it a try brother. Brother! My folks will create a big issue out of it brother. So what? Stop thinking about your folks brother. You really want to give it a shot right? Hmmm! Then go give it a shot brother! At least you'll be happy that you tried what you liked right? By the way bro! Is driving cab your favorite job? No brother! This is like a part- time job. My dream is totally different. This is like our dreams and ambitions floating in the air... suddenly coming out of a stranger's mouth. You could've listened to the cab driver's words and gone to the audition no? Brat! You went to the audition right? Huh? Tell me dude! Hi! You go in next switch off your phone before you go. Meera! I thought you wouldn't come. I felt I should give it a shot So... OKay! Wait here. Meera! I haven't prepared any scene to perform. Give me a scene no? I'll manage. Well...A scene... Here! Prepare for this scene. OKAY? Meera! This scene has female characters? Uh...prepare for your character I'll take care of the rest. Then come let's prepare together. Dude! This is my story. Switch off your phone while you come inside. (chatter) - Meera! - Sir? - How many are left? - 12 more sir. Ask them to come. Yeah! Sit! What's your name? Arjun! Huh? Arjun sir. Hmmm OK! Ready to perform? What's the scene? Pa...ba...Break-up scene sir. OKAY! OKAY! Let's see. Is it the first time? Relax! OK? Forget about the fact that... ...you're surrounded by 8-10 people. Just get transported into that character and its world. OK? Relax! Close your eyes take a deep breath. Yeah? Go for it. And... Action! Hello! Tell me Preethi. Achu, what happened to the match? I lost it. OK leave it There's always a next match. You aren't hurt right? What if I get hurt now? Why are you screaming now? I just asked you out of concern. My... My problem in itself is the love and concern you shower me with. Preethi! Before you entered my life boxing was my everything. My focus was completely on boxing. But now? My vision is completely surrounded by you. Before this I've won a few and lost a few Preethi. But... ...I've never had the fear of losing. Now I have that fear. I'm scared what if something happens and I don't get to live with you. That fear is making me lose even before I enter the ring. I can't let my dream go off Preethi. You... I don't want this love. Arvind! Don't be impulsive. Whatever it is come let's meet and... I don't want it. If I see you in person I will want you. OKAY! But do you think you can forget me? Arvind! You're a natural Arjun. You performed well. I'll let you know. We'll work. Yeah? But... Really... Good job! After a long time... ...I heard the sound of applause in my life sir. She's the reason for that. All of a sudden she looked very different to my eyes. I didn't know if it was love or something else. But I felt she was the right girl for me. - Hey hey hey hey hey! - Baby! You didn't live with the girl you married. You wanted to live with the girl you liked. There's nothing wrong in that. Sir! Nothing like that sir. What I did was very wrong. Myself wanting her was unethical. That's the truth. I don't want to hide anything. Thanks Meera! For what? If you hadn't come back in my life... I would've stayed forever in a job that I didn't like. It's just now... ...that I feel like doing what I like. I've got my senses working now. After this I'm planning to try things in a full swing. You're a good actor Arjun. Please try you'll get a lot of opportunities. Hey, you gave me a scene for that audition right? That scene was superb! You can do that story as a movie no? It'll be a runaway hit. That's not possible. Why? I tried to make it into a movie a year back. The shooting stopped in 10 days. Hey just don't bluff. I'm not bluffing I'm serious. A producer asked me to make a movie with his son as the hero. The minute I saw him I knew he wouldn't fit into my story. But I didn't want to miss an opportunity that knocked my door. One day while shooting he didn't perform well. I yelled at him in front of everyone. His ego hit him hard as to how can I yell at him. He stopped the movie. OKAY... You can start it off with a new producer right? Life gives you second chances Arjun! But not cinema. Excuse me. Hey! Meera! Meera! Meera don't lose hope. You'll definitely get a second chance. Not only in cinema Arjun Even in life I didn't get what I wished for. OK, take care! Anu! Hey! It's nothing like what you think... Why did you slap me? You didn't come to office. Your phone was switched off! Without knowing where you went and what happened... ...I searched all over the city and at last came here to the see the site of... ...you getting drunk and having fun with a random girl. You want me to cuddle you instead of slapping you? Hey! Don't talk rubbish! Oh, Am I speaking rubbish? OK! There's nothing between you both right? Call her right now and say 'AKKA' (ELDER SISTER) Do it right now. For god's sake please understand. There's nothing like what you think. Because of her I got an audition today and got a chance to perform. What? Wait wait wait What? You got an opportunity to act? Oh God! Oh, so you have an excuse to roam around with her right? Hey! Don't suspect me without understanding. I'm interested in acting so I gave it a shot. That's it. If you're that much interested... ...why didn't you try all these days? Why is this passion popping out after her arrival? Why? It's not because of her arrival. When I work for your company and go through hell... I realized...I should be doing what I like. Going further I can't go check the comfort level... of a toilet closet with your dad. Got it? You don't have the eligibility to talk about my dad. Hey! I'm not eligible? As if you own the Apple company. You're just making toiletries right? This eligibility is more than enough for that. If a duffer like you is treated with a job and a wife this is how you'll talk. Did I ask for it? SSSHHH!!! Did I ask for you to marry me? Did I come to your dad and seek for a job? I just nodded my head to whatever you guys said. I'm not eligible. I shouldn't have got married at all. Correct! Correct! If you hadn't got married you could've been with her. You could've done anything you want. Now that I'm here to question you... ...that's what is irritating you. After so many explanations you still talk about her? Yes! If I hadn't married you I would've fallen for her. You got it? Then why the hell did you accept the other day? Huh? If you had said 'NO' I would've happily married the guy chosen by my dad no? Huh? It's not too late. You can still divorce me and marry the guy chosen by your dad and live peacefully. Divorce? DIVORCE? So you've started thinking that far? Yes! Without being in love or having an understanding... ...being in this marriage is pointless. We can instead get divorced for God's sake and live peacefully. So you don't... So you don't love me at all? No! To summarize in short... ...without knowing if you're in love with a girl or not... ...and getting married to her was your blunder. So you're the sole reason for all the problem. - Isn't it? - Yes! How did you manage to pile it upon me sir? I'm married to a person who is supposed to be my friend... and it was destined that way by the guy above all of us... That guy is the sole reason. It's not the guy above us! It's the guy right opposite to you. - This guy? - Yes! Damn it! What did he do? Poor fellow! You said the fault is of the guy above all of us right? That's me. You...You mean... God? Kadavul? (GOD?) If you'll understand only through that term and if you wish so then let it be. Sir? You? Another God! Another God? Yes YOV! For the buildup you both gave I thought you guys are some Hi-Tech Swamijis. I thought you will give me some holy ashes and make my life better. But you guys went a step ahead and claim to be GOD! At last you're trying to trick me into it right? - Gods? - Yes! Oh my God! He's doing well no? Love Court! I'm getting late for the court so I'm leaving. But... Thanks for the entertainment. Kadavul (GOD)? Hey Arjun! I don't have time. Arjun wait no? Yov! Get lost. You'll believe I'm a god only if you see some magic, right? Ayushman Bhava! (LONG LIVE) "Oh My God!" "Oh My God!" "Oh My God!" "I am the God The world is in my hand" "Oh My God!" Don't be scared. We've come here to help you. According to you I'm at fault right? I'll correct the mistakes I did. "I supervise everyone in this world" "Oh My God!" "I am the God The world is in my hand" "Oh My God!" To make your life as you wish... I'm giving you a second chance. This ticket. You don't get it right? This is a ticket for journey of your life ahead. You still don't get it right? You won't get it. Take that. Boss! Tell him the condition. Condition number 1. This ticket should always stay with you. Condition number 2. You should never utter a word about this second chance to anyone else. Condition number 3. If you leak it... ...you'll die. "I am on phone Am on Twitter too" "You can see me everywhere" "One minute is enough to change the world" "Dare commit a faux pas I am up there to witness" "Don't scratch your brains I am your God" Arjun! Hmmm! ARJUN! HMMM! Screams! Arjun, why are you screaming? It's a bad dream. Arjun! Huh-Huh! You haven't said anything about what I asked for. About what? About us getting married! I can't get married to you Anu! Oh! Give me one good reason to say 'NO' to me. One reason? We both have already been... You tell you die! What are you doing? Uh! You need to be in love to get married Anu. We both are friends. Being the same till the end... ...will be good for you... ...good for me and... ...good for everyone around. Huh? You're not blabbering because you're high right? I make more sense when I'm high Anu! Bye! Bro, let's go bro! Let's go, Let's go, let's go bro!!! WOOOOO! Wooo! Yov, what happened? Woo-Woo! Yov! I will you throw you off the auto. Woo-woo-woooo! Dude! What's your problem? Brother! You wouldn't get it if I say bro! I don't want the money, I'll take leave. What a mad guy! My hall! My watch! My TV! SOFA! My house! I'm back! Oh my kadavule! (GOD) Mom! Dad! My room! Double cot! Married man! Single cot! Single man! Hey, add me on facebook? bye! Single man! Me! He needs an alarm to wake up at 11:00 AM! Arjun! Hey Arjun! Wake up! Mom? What's up? Mom! What's up? Mom! What happened? Crackpot! Take bath and come have your breakfast. - Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! - Hey, Hey, Hey! What happened? What happened to him? Hey Arjun! Come back soon in the evening, dad wanted to talk to you. Hey! I'm talking to you, and what are you looking at in your empty hand? You can't see this? No! You can see only if something is there right? Hey! I'm noticing you since morning, you sound very different. Hey! Did you drink last night? Ha! No, no, I didn't drink. Here, have some dosas. Oh my God! It's been so long since I had dosas made by you. - You should eat her dosas! - If you leak the truth!!! Hey, Hey What are you doing? You won't get it Mom! He sure would've gotten drunk last night. Thambi, looks like you are waiting for someone for a very long time! No! Nothing like that. Okay! It's him Mani! Tell me dude! What's up dude? You said "YES" to Anu? No dude! Why? I like Meera! What? You mean Meeraakka? Hey! MEERA! After so many years you met her yesterday only at the bar! How can you fall in love with her so quickly? Dude, I don't know how to make you... You won't get it dude! I won't get it? "Haiyo haiyo haiyo... she is killing me." Dude, don't be kidding, she's elder than you. Listen to me, this won't work out. Hey! Even if she's elder than me, she's one of a kind, dude. Hey hey hey! - Why do you behave like this? - OK, I need to go now, bye, bye "Haiyo haiyo haiyo... she is killing me." "With thousand watt like bright eyes, she is chewing me slowly like a hot 'jilebi'." Meera! Arjun! What are you doing here? Friend's house, It's very close by! I've never seen you here. Even I've never seen you here. OK, we'll catch up later Bye! Bye! Arjun! Uh...Arjun! Sorry, my bike isn't starting, I've an important work, can you drop me? Sorry to ask dude! What? Sure Meera! What happened? "Yamm yamma...she is killing me. She is chewing me again & again." "She is attacking me. She is making me go to pieces." "Yamm yamma...she is killing me. She is chewing me again & again." "She is stirring my mind. She is making me totally go mad." Why are you so tensed Meera? Well Arjun! I've got a producer who is ready to produce my movie. He said, he will sign the agreement today and introduce me to the hero. It won't be nice if I go late right? Hey, don't worry about all that, we'll go fast... We'll get a second chance in life Arjun! But in cinema... Arjun, move Arjun! Go! Just a minute. Well, how to tell her, I can't be explicit about it. Uh...Meera! Huh? Nowadays producers are torturing to make their sons as Heroes. Directors also say OK for it and the film gets dropped... and they're stranded in the middle of the road. Why do you jinx it? NO, that's what I heard, so... ...be careful Meera! Thank you! For what? For confusing me! Hey! Can I come with you? But you should not talk. Come! No thanks! - You can take care of all that. - Okay Welcome, come inside. Come inside soon dear, auspicious time is closing in. Come come! Yov! Where is that agreement? Oh it's here! Come come! Here, pray to the God and sign the agreement. Everything is perfect dear. Well sir, you didn't tell me who the Hero is. Well, who else dear, it's my son. Hey come in son! Here he is! Here's my lion cub! What a style huh? How's he? Sign it dear. Sign it before the auspicious time closes in. Sign it dear. Sign, sign! Sign, sign! What happened? Well, it happened just like you said. That's what is confusing me. Well...Leave that, what happened inside? Did you sign the agreement? What's there to think in this? You think that guy will fit into your story? Will he? Then what? It's very difficult to get a chance. I'm thinking why I should let it go. Oh lord, Meera! I'll tell you what the experienced have told me. You'll get a second chance in life... ...but in cinema? Don't be impulsive Meera! Huh? Please! Think well! Hello! Sign the papers soon. It's getting late. Just a minute. How long will you take? Well, don't mistake me! I'm not interested to make a film with you. Sorry! Come on! Hey! Stop right there. What a bad attitude you have huh? In spite of being a girl we decided to give you a chance... ...and you throw an attitude like that? In spite of being a girl? Thanks to you I didn't sign it. Hey! I'll see to it you never make a movie ever. Hey! Catch hold of her. You can't hurt a girl bro, get inside. You should've seen his face when you showed him your middle finger. Oh my God! You've got so much guts Meera! I'm amazed. OK, you've been roaming around with me since morning, don't you have office? Oh you didn't know. I cleared my college arrears yesterday only. Also...I'm interested in acting. That's why I wanted to give it a shot. Guide me if you can. Oh! You used to act really well in school right? Arjun, you're a good actor. Do try, you'll get a lot of opportunities. Same words. Huh? I don't get it. You won't get it Meera! Thank you da. Arjun, come up and leave after the rain stops. No, it's OK Meera! Don't be silly, come! "O my beloved baby... something special her beauty" "With her hypnotic TikTok she made me conk" "Made of a golden chariot, if she walks believe, it appeals very mass" "And made me loiter after her" "Will steal the Kohinoor diamond fix it to her anklet" "And give it to her in our honeymoon" "To live together we, will apply for a bank loan" "Will buy a nice house in Kashmir" "Haiyo haiyo haiyo... she is killing me." "With thousand watt like bright eyes, she is chewing me slowly like a hot 'jilebi'." "Haiyo haiyo haiyo... she is killing me." "With thousand watt like bright eyes, she is chewing me slowly like a hot 'jilebi'." I feel like this rain should never stop! Why? Uh... Well... If it keeps raining in Chennai... ...we won't have this water scarcity, right? - Meera! - Hmmm! - What's your phone number? - Note it down. - 98410 - 98410... - 22... - 22... - 485! How do you know? Oh, it's correct? Coincidence. Rain has stopped Meera! I'll take leave. Thanks for the coffee. Arjun! If I hadn't met you today... ...I would've made a wrong decision in my life. Uh... But whatever happened today doesn't seem like coincidence to me. I swear it's coincidence Meera! Maybe it's all God's plan. Yeah, we can say that too. Thank you Arjun! Hey! This is Sruti! My best friend! This is Arjun! My school junior. "Oh she's slowly melting inside me like a..." "Hot-Hot Jalebi!" Hey! Sit down. Finally you've cleared your arrears. Don't sit at home like a duffer, apply for jobs. Dad! I want to get into acting dad. What? You're going to study? You took 6 years for engineering. What else are you going to study? Not studying dad... ...Acting What did you say? You're going to act? Are you nuts? Saying acting, damn it! No dad. From childhood I've this dream of acting. At least I'll try now no? Hey, I'm noticing from the morning, your behavior is very strange. Why do we've to go through this cinema dear? Get a job, get and work and settle down in life... I can't Mom. I've experienced how boring life is if I live the way you say. I've told you not to tell! Life will be irritating Mom. What? Irritating? Then why did we have to make you study engineering? For what sake? Please dad. I'll just try for a year. What do you say? What's all this? Tell me dude! Arjun! I said OK to marry Matthew. Next week is the engagement. I called you to just say that. Nothing else. Anu! She's gone. Hey! Why did you put her on conference? Why are you avoiding her call? What? You are prioritizing a potential girlfriend over a friend? Damn it! Then what? Dude! You won't get it dude! I won't get it? You're the one who is messed up since morning. Hey what happened? you suddenly fall in love with Meeraakka? You're avoiding Anu? What happened to you? She just asked you if you'll marry her. Say 'YES' if you want to, or else just go. Dude! Anu is our friend, OK? Don't forget that, OK? Crackpot. Baby, just one peg baby! Why do you always beg for the peg Mani? Baby! Just one! OK, go ahead. I will. I thought you won't come. Come! Hey! Be calm. - Hey! - Hi! - How're you? - I'm good. Tell me now! Why did you avoid her? You won't get it dude. Baby, he's annoying me. Hey, Anu is here. Why is she avoiding me? You did it right? It's her turn now. Coming out for a smoke? Let's go. "In the eyes, without seeing your face." "In my soul, I lost you today." What? Huh...What? Matthew No! Matthew! "I wish for the nights to extend." "My poetry became a spelling mistake." "My heart became my own enemy." Look at him no? Though he looks like a temple cow with blazers on... ...he seems like a nice guy right? Why do you have this dull face now? But it doesn't look good to see you both like this dude. It's very annoying. Do something and talk to her no? You get it? What did you understand? If I ask something, you keep saying I won't get it. I'm not up for this. Hey Arjun, come in. Is Anu here Maa...uh Uncle? Anu has gone out with Matthew, she'll be back, you come inside. It's OK uncle, I'll come once Anu is back. Hey, come in now. Come. Sit down. Whisky? No, I'm good uncle. It's a scotch dude. I've to drive back uncle. OK! Jesus! Cheers dude! Anu told me. That you've cleared all your arrears. Hmmm, yes uncle. Why don't you join in my company? Hey! If you're not interested it's fine. Why are you over reacting? Sit down. Why are you not interested? Uh... I'm interested in acting Uncle. So...I'm planning to pursue that. Very good. If you don't take a risk at this age, then when else can you? I've seen you acting really well in school dramas. Do try! Not easy uncle. My dad is not talking to me for this decision. He doesn't have confidence in me. Well... Let it go uncle. Come with me. Come! Kallikulam That's where I was born. It's a small village in the Tirunelveli Zilla. Growing up, I've never seen a toilet Arjun. We always used to do things outdoors. One fine day, my Mom went to use the fields nearby to you know... She died of a snake bite. What's the reason for this? We didn't have a toilet in our house. If we had one, my mom wouldn't have died right? That's when I decided. No one else should suffer like how I suffered. When I said I want to build free toilets in my village... ...everyone laughed at me like I'm mad. But that didn't bother me. I just got a train to Chennai with a single bag. I worked my ass off day and night. That's the reason I own this toiletry company now. Today I own a bungalow, a car... ...I've money in bank. But the happiness is not in that. From my own hard earned money... in my village you see... ...I've built 420 free toilets. The ones who laughed at me the other day... ...are spellbound now. If we prove our mettle in front of others no? ...then everyone will start believing in us. What should we do for that? Hard work is necessary. But one thing... I failed to take care of my wife properly. She passed away. The thought of my daughter getting married... ...is scaring me. If she'll be taken good care or not. She'll be fine no? I know Arjun from his childhood. I know he'll take good care of my daughter. What else do I want sir? As if you guys own an APPLE company! You're just making toiletries right? OK, uncle! I'll take leave. Give this to Anu uncle. Sorry uncle! For what? I'm sorry! He spoke to my dad and felt very bad that you're not talking to him uncle. What else can I do? I'm afraid his life will be spoiled if he gets into cinema. If he's a small boy, I can make him understand by a slap or two. He's a grown up man now. I understand uncle. You're fear is understandable. But I'm not telling this to just support him. He's really talented uncle. Look at this. 'Other than that in the history of my prestigious life...' 'No place for other words' All these were shot when he acted in college functions. You can see for yourself how many people are... clapping and whistling for his performance. It's just one life uncle. Let him do what he likes no? I'm sure he will make you proud one day. Please uncle. Talk to him no? Please. - Be well dear. - Thank you uncle. That guy should be blessed to have you as his wife. Be well dear. Thank you Mom! Even we have a dream of getting him married. If he gets into acting, who do you think will marry him? You tell me. Will you marry such a guy? Of course I will Mom! But I'll have a condition that I'll divorce him if he gets close to the heroines. Whatever! Hey! Hey! Sorry! I'm sorry too! Noodle-Head! Congrats! I'm going to invite Mani, you want to join? Let's go. Bye Mom! Hey! You just have one year's time. Thanks Dad! "Why does need a wife while women all around-?" Hey it's a good song dude, why did you stop? You don't like this song right? I like all the A.R.Rahman songs. Play it. No! It's been long since we spoke, so let's talk. OK! Hey, I forgot to ask you something. I heard you're in love with Meera! Did Mani tell you? I know that since our childhood... ...that you have a crush on her. Nothing like that. Just now... ...after I got to know about her. Oh! Did you ask her out? Hey! I don't even know if she likes me. How'll I ask her out? OK, call her now. For what? Call her and say... ...we have a friend's bachelorette party this weekend... ...and ask her if she would join you. Hey! Why would she come to your bachelorette party? Correct! It's not even necessary that she should come to a stranger's party. But if she says she'll come just because you invited her... ...then of course she's interested in you. Hey! Noodle-Head! Haan! What? Call her. Haan! Line's busy. OK leave it. But let her call back, OK? What non sense are you talking? I'll thrash your face. Oh, so you think my parents got me married to you so that you can thrash my face? I dare you touch me, I'll divorce you and go away. Are you trying to scare me with a broomstick? Who the hell are you to divorce me? I'll divorce you, get out now. Hey! Why are you going inside? Your father's house is this way out. Hey Mani! Hey! You both got back together? Super! - Hey Swathi! - What? Friends have come, come outside. Welcome. What's this divorce talk and all? That's wrong Mani. Dude! You keep baby-ing her when you guys come outside? And you keep fighting like this here? Can you please stop your advises? Who's not fighting at home? You guys don't even know what we're fighting for! As if...! I told her, we need to have a baby to get a closure to the family. She says 'NO'. Why Swathi? If we have a baby, the time I spend with him will become very less. So...! Any which ways, both the reasons are love based right? She's my love dude! I won't just leave her. Baby? Imagine how he was during college? And look at him now. He's so matured right? We can never predict how people will change after marriage right? Oh-Oh! Meera, Meera! Hey! - Answer now, answer now. - No No No! Hello! Meera! Yes, Arjun! - What to tell? - Ask her no? What's up? This weekend... We have our friend's bachelorette party! OKAY! Will you join me? Sure, I will come. Yes! "My heart is flying developing wings." "It is the phase of my age. Hormones are secreting." "I'm falling for you… haiyo. Where did I miss my breath?" "Why am I stammering forgetting my mother tongue?" "My love is suffering & lying here." "I can't tolerate this pain anymore." "Even then there is a new feeling inside me." "Is this fate? Love is confusing." "This love is confusing..." "This love is confusing..." "My heart is also slipping." - I'll just go get the car and come. - Yeah! Hey Mani? You told I look mediocre? Hey! You should definitely come for our wedding. - March 10th? - Yes! My birthday! Oh, what a coincidence. So then... You're done with the wedding shopping? No, yet to start. Listen, you have to come OK? I'll definitely come. Hey, Meera! Cab has arrived. - Nice meeting you. - All the best, Bye! You just have 25 days remaining for the wedding, get done with the shopping soon. Yeah! OK, I'll take leave. Hey, I'll take care, you be here. Are you sure? Ya ya, I'll manage bye! OKAY! - Bye! - Bye! "Half celebrity and half my bad mentality..." "...it will be my regular life." I'm sure she likes you. - Hmmm? - Hmmm! Plan something big and propose her on her birthday! What shall I do? You want an idea effortlessly? You help me out with the wedding shopping. I'll give you idea. Deal? Birthday video. Huh? Birthday Video! Birthday video? Uhhmm! She will have few favourite people from childhood no? Meet everyone of them and... ...make a birthday video and gift it to her. How can this become a proposal? At the end of the video, you also wish her and propose her. Hey! Try this one, it'll look good. The idea is good. But... But? Hey! I know very little about her. How'll I search for her favorite people? Do you know any of her friends? Hmmm! You know heels won't fit you right? Then why do you want to try this? You're going to slip and fall down on the day of your wedding. Be careful. Most of the people in the list given by Priya are in Kerala dude. Call everyone and ask them when they'll be free and start to Kerala. Why should I unnecessarily go there? Isn't it better if... ...If I ask them to record it and send it to me? Unnecessarily? Haan! Hey! More than the gift you give her... ...its efforts that will impress her. Oh! Oh By the way, How do you know all these things? I'm a girl dude. Arjun! Hmmm! "Oh My God!" How's it? It's beautiful! "This love is confusing." "Oh...!" "This love is confusing..." Dude! Tell me! I'm planning to make a video and propose on Meera's b'day. Do it. Who asked you not to? Need to go to Kerala or a couple of days. Come with me. Ey! No chance. My in-laws are home. You go and come. OK, hang up! Shall I come with you? Don't be kidding Anu! Your wedding is in a week. It's just two days right? I'll manage. Like Mani said, after marriage, life will change Arjun. It'll be hard to meet even rarely. Let's forget this wedding thing... and just like school college days... ...I want to spend time with you. Please Arjun! During college final year... ...remember you asked for a bike trip? Hmmm! Let's do that? Seriously? SERIOUSLY? YEAH! OK, let's go. "Yesterday I saw you with a different eye." "Today you became a memory forever." "The distance that I covered with you, is there in my mind." "It is there as a buzzing wave in my heart." "I'm swirling around you like a kite." "I'm waiting for you to stretch your hand and catch me." "What is the meaning for all this? I must ask you." "If the time comes together..." "Shall we gasp? Shall we gasp?" "Shall we gasp together?" "Shall we gasp? Shall we gasp?" "Shall we gasp?" "If you continue to talk, my wounds will heal." "When the dawn comes, you appear beautifully in my sky..." "...as everlasting sun." "Remaining for a long time, after imparting warmth..." "You turn as moon & remain there." "After seeing you today, I ask myself..." "Keeping a diamond in hand, where did I search all over?" "Even after knowing it is the truth, my heart is hesitating to say." "If only we can hold our hands together & talk, I'll get confidence." Looks like it'll rain Arjun! Just halt in whichever hotel that comes next. Hmmm...OK! This place looks a little off to me. I'm very tired. It's OK. Just one night right? We'll manage. I think it's the last room. What are you doing? Well, I'll sleep on the floor. Hey! Noodle-Head, my friend. Hey! Arjun please Arjun please Go to hell! What? Noting. Sleep now, we need to wakeup early. What's the cost of this item? I don't get it. I mean, how much does she charge per night? Don't hit me. She's my wife. Sorry brother, sorry I didn't know. "Shall we gasp?" "Shall we gasp together?" This view is so romantic no? Mmmm! Hmmm, propose now. I love you Anu! You got the name wrong dude. Huh? Sorry! OK, get it right this time. Hmmm, Anu! Not now. I don't feel like it. I'll do it later when I'm alone. Ohhh! So you want to feel it alone! Bye! One second! Hmmm! Would you mind getting wishes from my brother also? Umm...What's your brother's name? Krishna! Krishna's name is...not on the list. Um...Meera and my brother were dating each other. Later they broke up, so Shruthi would've forgot to tell you. But Meera will be really happy to see my brother in the video. Why should we bring in old... Where will your brother be? Uh...He's gone to the boxing club. Just give me two minutes, I'll take you there. Then come let's prepare it together. Hey! This is my story. Priya! Krishna... Is he a boxer? Boxing is his everything. Krishna! This is just like a part time job for me. My dream is totally something else. Why are you so excited to meet her ex? Hey, you won't get it dude. Brother! How have you been? I swear I didn't expect to see you here. Priya! Who are they? They're Meera's friends, they've come from Chennai to record a video for her birthday. Brother! I've already hurt her so much. If she sees me again in the video... ...it'll hurt her more. So, let's not do this. Please. 'Now I'm afraid.' 'I'm afraid I won't be able to live with you if something happens.' 'That fear is making me lose even before I enter the ring.' Brother! You haven't moved on right? How do you know he's still not moved on? I'm a boy Anu. Everyone will have a past in their life Arjun! You don't think about anything and just propose to Meera! She'll definitely accept. You look beautiful with your curly hair Anu! Why are you talking something out of context? I felt it... ...so I said it. All these years you've been teasing me Noodle-Head! What's with you now? I understand everything in life very late. That's why! "Shall we gasp? Shall we gasp? Shall we gasp?" "Shall we gasp together? Shall we gasp?" "Shall we gasp?" "If you continue to talk, my wounds will heal." Hmmm! Thanks for the trip Arjun! I'll never forget these two days in my life. All the best for your love. Anu! Hmmm? 'Without being in love or having an understanding...' '...being in this marriage is pointless.' 'We can instead get divorced for God's sake and live peacefully.' 'So you don't...' ''So you don't love me at all?' All the best for your wedding! "O heart, it never forgets! O heart! O heart!" "Today also it is you in my heart." "O heart, it never forgets! O heart! O heart!" "Today also it is you in my heart." You will come back at 4 PM to sign the divorce right? Divorce? DIVORCE? - You go dad, I'll be here. - OKAY! You come with me. - Hey! Hi. - Hi! What's up dude? You gave the birthday video to Meera? After watching it, she must've hugged and kissed you! Hey Meera! Happy b'day! Happy b'day Meera! How long to see you Happy birthday my dear! Many more happy returns of the day You're happy right? Happy b'day Meera! You've one more surprise! Just look that side. Sorry! Arjun? Thanks! You idiot... Mani? You think you're Vijay from Poove Unakkaga? Then why did you... Why did you set them both up? Swear to me! Don't you feel bad looking at a girl you love with another guy? It did feel bad dude! When I saw Anu with Matthew in their engagement! When Matthew kissed Anu! It killed me dude! Hey! Are you in love with Anu? Dude! Dude, I'm not able to be here. I'll be out. Hey Arjun! Arjun? Hey dude! Hey! Does Anu know that you're in love with her? Why didn't you tell her? You won't get it dude! Damn it... If you had said "YES" when she asked you out, you wouldn't be sitting here now. What could you have done! God has miscalculated your fate. (LAUGHS) Hey! Why are you laughing like a mad person now? You won't get that too dude! Damn it! You'll never know the value of something when it's with you right? You'll know only after you lose it, huh? Hmmm! OK, come! Come, let's talk something to her and stop the wedding. Hey! Don't behave like a cinema friend. Will you come now, or shall I go? Hey! You think she'll throw off everything and come if you go and call? Anu is a practical girl dude! She won't come. You idiot! Hey! Auto! Anu! Hey dude, come on! Boopathi, 2 tequila shots please! Hey crackpot! You ran away from your wedding to have a drink? 3 more shots please! What happened Anu? I don't like getting married Arjun! You don't like? Then why did you accept to get married? Why didn't you propose to Meera? She's asking you! Answer her, sir! I felt I didn't have any Love on her. So...! He's lying Anu, He's in love with you... Shut up! I know Arjun! Hey-Hey! Careful! I love you Anu! I understand everything in life very late. All the best for your wedding. I felt you were in love with me. Will you take Matthew as your husband and marry him? If I say "NO" now, I know how many people it'll affect. But you felt very bad and left out of the church no? That's why... ...I threw off everything and came. You seemed lonely standing here. That's why I came. Nothing like that. You think I can't figure out looking at your face? Whatever you did is pure madness. I know! But... You can't look out for logic in love. It's a magic! You told me these words. Hey! Come on come on come on! Talk now! Anu! You are too good a girl Anu! But I don't deserve you! Matthew is a nice guy! He'll be your right match! You're right! But he's not you. I'll be happy only if I'm with you. Nope! You'll go through hell! Hey! Hell or heaven, you'll know only if you live. How can you tell that without living? Dude! You won't get it dude! He's started it again. Hey! Why the hell do you keep saying the same thing? First tell me what it is. I'll tell you if I get it or not! Tell me Arjun! No Anu! Hey tell me now! You tell, you die. I've already married you, dragged you till divorce and hurt you. You get it? Huh? Do you get it? You're going to die. Hey! Hey! Arjun, what are you doing? Arjun! Arjun! Arjun! Lorry! (SCREAMS) Your chances have been extinguished. That's it. You died in that life. Sir! Sir Sir! Arjun! Not honoring the condition was your mistake. But still we will forgive you and send you back to your old life. Don't stand here and keep talking. Go go, go to your court. Your watch doesn't have time right? If I go the court... and...if Anu gives divorce... Give me one more chance sir, restart my life again sir. This time I'll say "YES" and be happy with her sir. Please sir. The one who faces his own problem is a Hero. How about you? Hero right? Huh? Go! Go to the court and meet your Anu. Sir! I'm scared to even face her sir. All she expected from you is just Love. Go! Fall at your wife's feet! So much drama! I pity these humans! (LAUGHS) Sir! Can I hug you just once? Hmmm! "Oh My God!" Be well! "Oh My God!" "Oh My God!" "I am the God The world is in my hand" "Oh My God!" "All astrologies are in my packet." I'm very tired. Can we go on a holiday trip? Sir! We've a lot of pending cases. We need to finish our job. Just stay here. Oh my God! Hey dude! Don't do this. Listen to me, don't be impulsive. Come sir. Judge Ma'am will become furious. Come, come and stand here. You fainted in the morning, how're you? It's all stress Madam. Nothing else. Do we have your consent in this divorce? Hmmm! - Yes, you have my consent. - OK! Madam! I don't want this divorce Madam. Are you kidding me? You said you wanted it in the morning, now you don't want it? Do you know how many divorce cases are in pending? What do you think of yourself? I'm talking to you, look at me. It's my bad Madam. Asking for divorce was my impulsive decision. Not her. She likes me a lot Madam! She'll do anything for me. Why? She'll even throw off everything and come for me. Girls like her! No one can get Madam! I didn't understand her value and lost her. Don't ask me what happened and why it happened! I understood today! This Noodle-Head standing here... She's my friend, figure, lover, wife and everything. I know Madam! I know she's angry on me. But definitely one day... I'll make sure she understands how much I love her. Ask her to give me just one chance Madam! Just one chance. Please Madam! You've said everything no? What now? Can we give him one more chance? Why do we have to give him chance and all? Just cut them off Madam! There seems to be no reaction. Huh! Doesn't look like she's gained trust on you. Madam! You never know. She'll find out by just seeing this face Madam. If I'm lying or speaking the truth. Pah! What a slap! Will you call Meera as Akka? Meera Akka! Will you promise me that you won't move close with the heroines you act within cinema? Just like TR, I'll act without touching them. Do you really love me? You're not blabbering because you're high right? Sorry my Lord! Go home and do these things. What a stupid case this is. Case is dismissed. Lord Vinayaka! My friends are going to get divorced. He's a crackpot! But a nice guy! I don't know what to do. Somehow please stop them from getting divorced. - I'll break you 1000 coconuts. - Dude! Oh my God! She fainted again? Hey! We're back together. Back together? As in back together? But... ...it was different in the morning. ...now it's like this. How dude? Well! You won't get it dude! Condition number 2. You should never utter a word about this second chance to anyone. Condition number 3. If you say... ...nothing will happen. Take it. "Haiyo haiyo haiyo... she is killing me." "With thousand watt like bright eyes, she is chewing me slowly like a hot 'jilebi'."
