- My name's Sunny, why don't you sit down and relax. - Thank you. I've never been in a place like this. I don't know what you're supposed to do. I, I'll tell you, I'm just a little nervous. - First of all, you close the door. I mean, you don't mind my closing the door, you do trust me, don't you? - Yeah, is anybody gonna open it up? - No. - Who's gonna look... - No, no one's gonna see through that window. - Hey wait a second, what are you doing? - I have to give you a massage, don't I? - Well, yeah but uh, I, I didn't expect it to be so fast. My goodness. - Well, you are paying by the half hour, aren't you? - My goodness, you're in such a rush. - Oh, well I'm excited. I've never had a new customer in a long time. All my customers are usually my favorite customers. I hope you become one of my favorite customers. - Geez, wow, I'm having a little trouble here. - Ah, it's okay. - Yeah. - Uh, you're tickling me. - Oh, I'm sorry, I'll be more careful. What'd you say your first name was? - Irving. - Irving, oh, how nice. You have a very nice build, Irving, very muscular. - Oh, you're putting me on. - I'm not, in fact I know who you remind me of. You remind me of when I saw the revival of Gone with the Wind, Clark Gable. I mean, if he was a redhead, I would swear it was you. You wanna put your head down over there, Irving. You wanna lay on your stomach and I'll give you a nice massage. - All right, that's what it is, okay. Hey listen, is this all you do in here? I mean, really. - What do you mean? I mean, would you like to see more? - I'd like to see more, sure I'd like to see more. - It's gonna cost you more. - Well, how much, what do you mean, how much? - Well, if you'd like to see this little red top removed, it's gonna cost you 20 dollars. - 20 dollars? Gee, that's an awful lot of money. - Well Irving, don't you think I'm worth it? - Well, it's not a question of that. You know, money's hard to come by these days. I mean, 20 dollars, 20 dollars. - 20 dollars. - I'll give you five. - That's the house rules, 20 dollars. Do you want me to remove it or not? - How about 10? - How about 20? You wouldn't wanna go against business policy... - Okay, alright, wait a second, wait a second. Here ya go. - Oh, thank you. - How about that. - Is that worth 20 dollars? - Well, let me think about that for a while. - Why don't you lie back and I'll massage you some more. - Okay. Yeah, but I can't see anything from here. - Why don't you turn around the other way? I'll massage your chest. - Okay. - [Sunny] Can you see without your glasses, Irving? - Nope. - No? - No, I can't see very much without my glasses. - Oh. Would you like to see some more? - Well, I don't know if I can afford another 20 dollars. - [Sunny] Oh, but Irving, I mean supposing I was working for your business and they were trying to con me into something, would you want me to take the con? No, it's 20 dollars if you wanna see more. - Well, alright 20 dollars. - Okay. - Okay. ("Nutcracker Suite" instrumental) - Thank you. - Listen, you sure no one's gonna come in here? - No one's gonna come in here. - Good. - Just you and I for the half hour. - Oh okay, good. - Would you like to lie back again? - Okay. - Okay. - I thought you were gonna take your pants off all the way. - Oh, I can't, it's the house rules. I couldn't even take em off for 40 dollars. - How about 50? - I can't do it. But I could do something else. - What's that? - I could make you feel a lot better. - Oh really? - Mmm but that costs you more. - How much more? - Oh, that costs you 45 dollars. - Uh, I don't think I'm really interested. - You sure? - Oh, positive. - You know Irving, all my customers, all my favorite customers that come back to me, they like that the most. - No, I don't think so. - Well, a lot of their wives, they don't do it to them but I do it. I really like you, Irving. I'm sorry I have to charge you so much. In fact, I like you so much, maybe I'll do it for 30 dollars. - No, no thanks. I'm really not interested. - You're sure? - I'm positive. - You sure? - As a matter of fact, I think I better go now. Because it's really warm in here and I really feel bad about the whole thing, you know? I just feel lousy about it. This is my first and last time. - But... - It has nothing against you, it's just one of those things. I just feel very badly about it. I'm a married man, I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I came in here. I just, I guess it was just curiosity. It's not, you know, it's not you. You're a lovely girl, it's just that I don't know. - Well Irving, is it the 30 dollars? - Oh no, no, no, no, no, the heck with the 30 dollars, that's not important, it's the just the basis of, you know... - You're embarrassed, aren't you? - Oh, I feel idiotic. I just feel ridiculous about the whole thing but no, thank you very, very much. Excuse me for a moment. It's just that, well, I tried it and it's not for me and that's all there is to it. Hey, you know it's a funny thing. I never open these things up when I put my shirt on. You're the first person that ever did that. Why don't you get dressed, really. Well at any rate, don't feel badly about it. - Was it the 30 dollars? - No, no, no, no. - Or don't you like me? - Oh, you're a lovely girl it's just that... - Well, no one's ever walked out on me before. - Well, don't get insulted, don't feel bad. Thank you very much, it's just not my thing. I was curious and I feel very foolish about it. Well I'm going, thank you very much. Have a nice day, so long. (slams door) - See you next week, Jimmy. - Sure, kid. (spanks lightly) - Good day, sir. (light rock music) - Okay kid, do it. - 416 to headquarters. - [Radio Operator] Come in, 416. - Checked that disturbance on Third Avenue, no problems. Juveniles playing games. We're heading home from here. Ready, boss? (clicks TV on) (light jazz music) (light rock music) (door slams) - Hi. (smooches lightly) (can popping open) How many times have I told you not to leave that gun on the table? (light dramatic music) (mirror shatters) (gasping for breath) (TV orchestra music) (phone ringing) (groaning) - Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, I've been there. What? Yeah, yeah, we'll be right there, alright. Kenny, yeah, we have a homicide. Right, meet me at the corner of 79th, huh? Be there in 10 minutes. Right, okay. (light rock music) - Honey, what do you want to see tonight? Alice and Ed want to see John Wayne, honey? (light rock music) - Shit. (Pounds table) Get me the manager in here. You the one on duty? - Yeah. - I wanna find out who did this and I wanna find out fast. Who was he? Come on, come on, who did it? - A customer, I told the other cop. He gave his name as A. Maxwell. - Oh, he's phony as hell. Run a make on it, Danny, and see if we got anything. Well, what'd he look like? - Man, like the same as half our customers. I saw him go out but we were busy. I didn't notice Rosie didn't come down til later. You know the type, mid-30's, early 40's, businessman from out of town. - Tall, short, fat, bald? (Manager exhales loudly) - Medium height, light hair, man I didn't take his picture. - They're running a make on him now, Jimmy. Don't expect a miracle. - Listen, anybody giving Rosie a hard time? - No not here, everybody dug Rosie. She probably did some outside tricks, though. Why don't you ask her roommate? - You heard the man, Danny, check it out. (ringing doorbell) Find out where the roommate lives and see what she has to say. (ringing doorbell) - Excuse me, are you Rosie's roommate? - Uh, yes. (giggles) If you're looking for her, she's still at work. - Well miss, uh. - My name's Gwen. Listen, I gotta get some clothes on. I'll be right back, okay? She'll be back soon, come on in. - Uh, look miss. - Gwen. - Gwen. I'm a police officer. (exhaling loudly) - Wow, what a dope. Stupid Gwen lets anyone in, phew. - Look, I'm not here to hassle you. I'd like to have a few words with you. I think you better sit down. It's about Rosie, she's been murdered. - So wait a minute, let me see your badge or something. How did it happen? - Well, it wasn't very pleasant. She was strangled at the Venus Paradise. Must have been a maniac. We'd like to know who she went out with, anyone who was giving her a hard time, maybe a boyfriend? - I won't be much help, shit. Rosie was like a ghost. I worked nights and she worked days. We hardly saw each other. (crying) Oh, God. (sobbing) God. (sobbing) (dropping ice cube) (pouring wine) - God, you're never on time. You know, the one time that Alex and Ed get a babysitter and you've got to be late. You know, you think that all the bums and prostitutes in New York are more important than me. You know, I work like a slave around here. - Come on, already, come on. You wanna go or don't you? - Well, all I wanted was a little consideration. I mean, after all, I'm supposed to be your wife. I thought we'd been married for a few years now... (door slams shut) - Do you think it was someone she knew? - It's too early to tell. That's why we thought you might be able to help us. Did she ever talk about anybody, customers or dates giving her a hard time? Anyone with strange hangups? - Wait a minute, wait a minute. There was this one man, she didn't talk about him but she used to go over to his place about once a month. It was a client. She used to go over to his place and come back black and blue. Really must have been making it worth her while. - Do you remember his name, where he lived? - Mr. Creepy, yeah. - Mr. Creepy. - That's what it was, that's what she used to call him when she came home, Mr. Creepy just paid the rent. Mr. Creepy just bought her a new dress, you know right? She meant the money she was making. He really must have been taking good care of her. She never did any outside tricks besides him. - Well, keep going, where did he live? What did he look like, anything? - Think it was someplace over on Sutton Place but I'm not sure. Hey, she kept a date book. That's probably where the address is. I'll get it for you. - Good. - [Gwen] Here it is. His real name is Keyanovich. - That's him, Keyanovich, let's see where he's going. - [Jimmy] Look at that creep. He's heading right for the Venus Paradise. (dramatic rock music) (tires squealing) (light jazz music) (crashing loudly) (shouting) (grunting) - Hey, hey, don't kick him. - Hey, okay. (grunting) - [Danny] Alright mister, get up. Come on, you're under arrest, we're police officers. - Under arrest, under arrest? You want Marcus. - Come on. - What the hell is this about? You can't arrest me for anything, I know my rights. - What'd you do exactly, huh? - What the hell are you talking about? Okay, I know my rights, you can't do anything to me. - [Jimmy] Massaged for you? - What that kid from the massage parlor? I haven't seen her in a month! - Mother fucker. (punches loudly) - Spread em. (light dramatic music) (gasping for breath) (choking) - [Radio Announcer] Car 416, car 416, headquarters over. - [Jimmy] 416. - [Radio Announcer] Lexington and 46th, homicide. Massage parlor on the second floor, Everybody's Envy. - Got your number, Keyanovitch. We see you in this neighborhood again, we're gonna put you away, you get it? - [Keyanovitch] Yeah. - Now, get outta here. (shouting) - Hey, you guys assigned to this case? - That's right. - This one's real sick. Girl was smothered, acid thrown all over her. It ain't pretty. - What do you have? - Come on, I'll show you. Nothing much. (light dramatic music) - [Jimmy] God damn it, now where are we at? Nowhere. - Okay Sherlock, let's follow it up. - Well, first we gotta forget about personal feelings. I don't think Rosie's roommate will be any help, I don't think we'll learn anything from her. - None of them knew what hit em. - Questions all, forget about it. But I'm seeing her again. - What's the address of this place, Lex and 57th? 52nd, yeah. Let's see, Rosie's place is Third and 61st, huh? The only pattern we have is massage parlors. Maybe the bastard's crossing town. South and west. (exhales loudly) Christ. Hey before you go, hot lips, bring him out here, will ya? Now listen, where is the nearest massage parlors that run like south and west of here? - Look, I don't know. Times Square, I guess. You know, one of those shit shows. - Well, where is the nearest one? - Leisure Plus, 44th and Seventh. 44th and Seventh, that's right. - Gonna do a little personal investigation? - Kid, I thought you were going to the movies, huh? I'll check this one out, come on, get lost. Okay, one more time, kid. (light rock music) Here I am trying to find a needle in a haystack. Sure, yeah, just go out and find an average guy who goes out for a little fun, some God damned fun. Strangles Rosie and then he puts acid all over the other chicks. What's he gonna do for an encore? Clues, clues, the bastard leaves a ton of clues. But they're no God damned good. Surgical gloves, that leaves a million frustrated American men. Every criminal has an M.O. This guy is no different. He's gonna turn up somewhere and I've gotta find him. Man, there's sure a lot of sick weirdos in this town. Short, blonde, and purple lipstick, hoo hoo, boy, what a pair. This is getting me nowhere. My eight hours was over a day and a half ago. I'm goin home, I gotta clear my head up. (chattering) - Shit. - We'd love to go out sometime but (door slams) oh honey, I'll call you back. (exhales loudly) Oh honey, I heard about the other murder on the news tonight, do you have any leads? I said, do you have any leads? - I don't know, Emily, just don't know. I got a few men covering the Times Square area but I don't think that'll do any good. I gotta catch this damn maniac. - I don't know why you're so upset about this case. Why, because all those prostitutes are being punished? What about all the good people? The church people, when they get mugged and robbed? - Drop it Emily, will ya? I don't wanna talk about it. Give me some rest, huh? - Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about the whole thing, okay? (slams can) - [Man] Join the fun with Nick, yeah, yeah. (crowd cheering) (chattering) (light jazz music) (yelling) (chattering) - [Woman] I don't wanna get wet! (screaming) - [Group] Yeah, yeah! (chattering) (screaming loudly) - [Woman] Help, help! You crazy, you son of a bitch, help! (dramatic rock music) (tires squealing) - [Danny] I'm a police officer. - [Driver] Hey, what do you mean. I've never seen no officer like that before. What are you doing, what are you doing? Hey, where you going? You're a nut. (tires squealing) Where you goin with my cab? (tires squealing) (tires squealing) (crashing loudly) (metal pinging) (tires screeching) (crashing loudly) - Hey you crazy freak, what do you think you're doing? (crashing loudly) - Who the hell are you? - [Man] What are you, crazy man? She was sick or something. - Shut up. - [Man] She was a nut, man, I didn't do anything to her. - Stop. - Crazy, crazy. - I said shut up. Crazy, crazy. - Damn it to all hell. - Look what you did to my car. Look at it, my car, what are you, a nut? You're nuts, look at my car, my car! You crazy? My car! - [Radio Annoucer] Car 417, this is headquarters. Suspect's car contained two ounces of heroin. We've issued an A.P.B. Good thing you lucked out again, O'Mara. - Hit and miss. Just two fuck-up cops. You really think this is gonna help? - The owner of this joint is an old friend. I caught him dealing heroin three years ago. Then he had an S and M racket going two years ago. If anybody knows the kooks in town, he does. - Hey, my old buddy. You still getting free apples nowadays? I got a luscious chick here and she's gonna... - You heard wrong, baby. We're looking for a guy, a freak. You know, someone who'd cut up the chicks. Got any ideas? Maybe one of your old friends, huh? - Hey, Rozetti, I'm into honest, clean fun now. Hey, you wanna see the honest, clean fun there? (orchestra music) - [Woman] Is there a Lieutenant Rizzeti here? - [Jimmy] Yeah, that's me. - [Woman] Telephone for you. - Hey uh, where is it, buddy? Yeah? - Hey Rizzeti, I'm at number three, our boy got another girl at the Mad Hatter's on 57th. Yeah, he really laid into her. Did her rough something awful. He hanged her with a sheet. - Be right there. (slams phone) Your peep show's over, junior. Our man's hit again. (light dramatic music) Doesn't look like there's much to go on again, huh? Looks like the girl could have been dead several hours, same M.O., all clean cut, Mr. Average businessman, average height, average build, all that bologna. - I don't know, sounds like a broken record to me. Always the same average businessman. He doesn't take time out for lunch or after-work cocktails, he picks out a massage parlor, momentarily becomes a butcher, and (exhales loudly) then a few hours later, girl's found dead. No sound is heard and nobody sees this guy, bullshit. No one's that perfect. He's had to have left a clue somewhere. I don't know, maybe we're just on the wrong track. - Okay, Dr. Watson, you know, what do you suggest? - Hey, I'm still learning from you, boss. I'm upended. Wait a minute, that medallion looks rather familiar. - Yeah sure, I won one for my wife at Coney Island last summer. - No, no, no, wait a minute, let me think. Wait a minute, Gwen had one like this. So does the girl that was murdered at Everybody's Envy. - [Jimmy] Say Danny, did Gwen know anything about the medallion? - [Danny] Yeah, she bought it off some guy in the East Village. This astrologer, and evidently, all the girls go there and get their charts read. Gwen thinks he's around this place. Sure sounds like a nut to me. (light classical music) - Uh, my sleeping pills are messing up my horoscope and when I listen to rock and roll, my ear drums bleed. (door opening) - Come in gentlemen, I've been expecting you. The keepers of the peace are always welcome. - Yeah well, look buster, we'd like to ask you a few questions about... - A few questions, now. My tongue is not long enough to give you a full account of what's really going on, gentlemen. Today, you will have to unlearn all and everything you have ever learned before. All of your information is misinformation and what you call science is really nothing but an organized system of ignorance. I say to you most earnestly, it is far more important to go to heaven than it is to go to the moon. - Look here, now. - But what do we know about heaven? What do we know about the beyond? Do we know what's behind the beyond? I'm afraid some of us hardly know what's beyond the behind. Creatures of twilight and delusion, we drift and drift to our unknown ends and that's why I feel the best thing is not to be born but who is as lucky as that? To whom does it happen? Not one among millions and millions of people. - Look, buster. - Jimmy, hey, let me try. Look mister, we're on an investigation. We wanna know where you were on the nights of June 25th and 27th. Now, that's on a Monday and a Wednesday. - Yes, I see. Tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. near West 96th Street, I shall plunge into the Hudson and shortly thereafter, I shall reappear on the coast of New Jersey as a white swan. It will be a miracle and there will be dancing in the streets. The establishment hushes it up, of course. - Danny, enough of this bullshit, huh? - The voice from the sewer, huh? - Oh, you creep. - Moron. - Worm. - Imbecile. - Degenerate. - Idiot. (punches loudly) - [Danny] Jimmy! Don't blow it now. We've spent too much damn time on this case. - If this creep doesn't tell us what he knows, I'll kick his fancy ass from here to the East River. - [Danny] Take it easy, easy. (breathing heavily) - [Man] It is my sincere wish that immediately after my death, my head be severed from my body and that it be replaced by a bouquet of broccoli to better comfort the worms. - Look mister, this is no joking matter. Three girls have been brutally murdered and right now, you're our prime suspect. Now, if you wish to continue this mumbo-jumbo, we'll just take you downtown and book you. - I was at the Einstein General Hospital, bleeding ulcers. - We'll check it out, buster, and if you're lying, we'll be back. - You'll be back, just be back. I'll rip you into a thousand odds and ends, each will be punched into the other. Just be back, just be back, you just be back. (breathing heavily) - [Danny] Hey Jimmy, what are all those great scientific policemen that you always used to lecture me about? - [Jimmy] Eh, the son of a bitch is just lucky. He's obviously insane. I mean, nobody could mutilate those girls like he did and be normal. - [Danny] Nobody who kills another person is normal but this guy is plenty smart. - [Jimmy] No, uh-uh, not smart, lucky. (light piano music) - [Danny Voiceover] Whatever made you go to a nut like that. Jimmy would have killed him if he hadn't finally spoken up. - [Gwen Voiceover] You're just uptight. Theodore's a lot of fun. You just can't take him seriously. It's like astrology and E.S.P. You want to believe in it completely but you can't quite. - [Danny Voiceover] I can't seem to shake this case. I keep thinking about this killer before I go to sleep. I almost have him but his face never seems to appear. Jimmy's pretty shook up, too. And everybody's getting on our asses. The precincts, the captains, City Hall and all, I don't know, I just don't know. Gwen, aren't you ever afraid? I mean, your work, guys with all kinds of hangups, freaks who wanna ball you, do all kinds of weird things. - [Gwen Voiceover] Danny, you're jealous. - [Danny Voiceover] Come on Gwen, you know I care for you. It's just that you could get hurt with all those guys. I mean, do you have to do it with... - [Gwen Voiceover] Danny, I've told you. It's just business, I'm not Lily White. Who is, nowadays? But I don't go around sleeping with frustrated old men for money, either. With me, it's strictly massage. Besides, half the guys are people even you'd feel sorry for. Lonely guys from out of town or working guys who live alone. I get paid as much for being a shrink as anything else. And if there's trouble, you can usually tell right off. There's always the other girls and the manager to yell for. (chattering) (giggling) - Hey. - Off with that? - I'll make you a drink. Sit down. - Make mine a strong one, will ya? - You get what I give you. (laughs) Hey listen, I'm betting it was Kennedy when you got your pants down, right? (laughs) Mm-hmm? This guy must really be lucky to get away with it. - Yeah, lucky. Son of a bitch. Ah, screw it. - Not it, me. - The last customer was a real freak. No more weirdos for me, I've had it. - Last night when I saw my darling Al, you know what, I've been going out with him for three months and I said, Al, you know you'll really miss Chris sticking it in all those weird places. After all, Al said, it's only for the moment or something, wouldn't you think the one place would be enough? - Takes all kinds of things to get my Sammy off, too. Whipped cream, flavored yogurt, I mean anything that's different, Sammy will try. The other night we went to see this movie, Shaft's Big Score ah... - Now there's a dude I can really go for. I mean, he's not just a movie star, he is sexy, you know? - Yeah sure, Sue, hey a guy that's got more than a few inches is sexy to you. - Right on. - Anyway, Sammy and I go out to see this picture and then we go out to eat, have lox and bagels, whoever thought of a sandwich like lox and bagels? I mean, I never liked fish. My mother was always bitching I wouldn't eat any. She should see me now. So, Sammy eats a corned beef and Swiss on rye with mustard with a Coke, he's always drinking Coke. Never coffee, Sammy never drank a coffee in his life and would you believe, after he finished all that, he had room for ice cream, banana splits! I mean, he ordered a whole banana split and then he takes the banana out of the bowl and he gets this look in his eye and he points the banana at my lap. I mean, that's, that's just a little uh... (knocking on door) (punches loudly) (plastic crinkling) (stabbing viciously) - Hey Jimmy, come on, it can't be all that bad. Look, it's only a job. We'll catch this nut, there'll be another and another and another. Come on, munch, eat, eat, eat, come on. - Eh, it just keeps bugging me. He should have made a mistake. - Hey, you're just uptight cause you're not getting any. Well this weekend, I'm gonna spend every minute of it with Gwen. - [Jimmy] Sure, kid. - Hey, how you makin out? - Hey, all right. - How you doing with those killings? - Yeah well, that's a zero so far. I don't know, pieces just don't seem to fit. - There's gotta be a pattern somewhere. He couldn't just come and go without being noticed. - Three girls in one week, he's really moving. The last one was a doozy, she was smashed and broken up. - Well this weekend, me, I'm gonna forget all my troubles. (dramatic organ music) - He wasn't planning to act out the service but merely to catalog them as the epitome of evil. What I told her is what I must repeat all too frequently in a world that demands absolutes. What I told her is God's own message as revealed not by scripture but by lessons of life as it is. (light music) You have been told before but you must be told again. The most important lessons are never too often heard. The cardinal sins, no, they are not the most grievous of sins, nor are they the greatest or most severe of all the sins. Rather, they are the sins that we must face directly in our lives. (light music) These seven deadly sins are the most simple ones but they are the ones that will lead us directly to the horrors of hell. From these acts do spring the sources of murder, of rape, of false gods, of sacrilege. They shall burn forever and ever, they who commit the seven deadly sins and do not repent. They shall not see the face of God but shall they eternally host Satan's pain, the seven deadly sins plight. And the devil did go in for his darling sin, for the pride that hates humility, envy. Envies of hope come hissing hot from hell. Anger, anger must be bathed in the sword of God's absolution, lust... - That's it, the guy's a religious nut! (glass shattering) (dramatic rock music) (tires squealing) (banging on door) - Hey, I thought Sunday was a day of rest? - I finished resting. He's sending these girls to hell, huh? We're going to a bookstore. I'll tell you on the way, come on, let's go. Seven deadly sins: pride, envy, anger, lust, gluttony, avarice, and sloth. I don't know what the hell half these sins are. But our boy does. The names of the parlors relate to the sins. Like Venus Paradise, envy, envy sure, Everybody's Envy. Number three, anger, the Mad Hatter, I got it! I finally got this sucker. - [Danny] Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yeah, I remember a couple days ago. - Yeah, the big idea about the killer working his way south and west across town? - [Jimmy] And it was the astrologer, I can feel it, Danny. He's gonna try someplace with a name that has to do with uh avarice or sloth or gluttony or lust, next. - [Danny] Yeah, right. Gwen! - [Jimmy] What the hell does she have to do with the sins? - Holy mackerel! - Hey, where the hell are you going? (dramatic rock music) (light music) Rosie's roommate? - Okay, inspector. Look, Goldberg at headquarters is pulling all the parlors that are linked to names having any of the sins in them. Yeah right, inspector, right. Okay, in ten minutes he'll have a man at each place. Hey, one of those joints is two blocks from here. Come on, we can make it over there before a patrol car. Come on, we'll tell em to close up business til the cop gets there, come on, come on. King Midas, let's go, geez. Look, I know how you feel, kid. I understand and I've been through this. I've seen it quite a few times. Hey, you really look bad. Come on, let me buy you a quick drink. (dramatic music) - Should I take my top off? - Of course! You want it? It's yours. I want you to put it inside of you. (woman laughs) All of it. - [Woman] Okay, beautiful, do you wanna watch? Ha, I've never seen so much money. - [Man] I want you to want the money. - [Woman] Oh I do, I do! - Show me how much you want the money. - I do want it, I do. - You devil. (suspenseful music) (slaps loudly) (man screaming) - Help, help! (man screaming) (gun firing) (man screaming) (church bell ringing) (funky disco music)
