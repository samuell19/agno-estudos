Don't worry, we'll give you a spray bottle -and some sunscreen. -What was the sermon about today? Forgiveness, here, you can practice. [groans] Okay. [coughs] I'm sorry. And I cannot endorse this announcement enough, Family Camp at Lake Katokwah is the highlight of our year. You ask our family, it's the greatest place on earth. So, they've literally never been to Disney? [sighs] I'm sorry I was late. -Again. -Okay. Well, what do I gotta do to make it up to you? [Dave] Zip lines, the whole nine. There's lots of things to do. How about we go to that camp? -[chuckles] Church camp? -Yes. How about we go someplace that has air conditioning? Just look at those cabins, ice cold air conditioning. -[audience laughs] -Can I get an amen? [audience] Amen. Still, Henry would hate it and Hannah's too old. It doesn't matter how old your kids are. -Huh. -Our daughter's 19 and she is more pumped for camp this year than ever, right, sweetie? -Woo-woo! -Woo-woo, sugar bear. -[all laugh] -Woo-woo. Okay, well, it's just the weird families who go to camp. I know, you might think we're a little weird. -Come on! -[shushes] But if you can honestly say there's nothing more important than investing in your family, then show up. That might look a little weird to the world. So camp signups starts today. Let's get out there and have some fun this summer. Okay, families? [Tommy] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on, hey! Hey, you weren't serious about that whole, uh, Family Camp thing, right? I mean, church camp is just so Jesus-y. Says the man standing in a church. Yeah, this is where Jesus belongs, not camping in a tent with me. Oh, gosh, Tommy. Grace, Grace, Grace, Grace, Grace, Grace, wait, listen. If I seal this next deal, I'm a shoo-in for partner, and then I'll take you wherever you want to go, -Hawaii, Paris? -[sighs] Come on, people, I need a nap and a buffet, chop chop. -Aw, so no bingo today, Grandpa? -[mild tempo music playing] Tommy, I don't want a vacation. I want my husband back. What are you talking about? We barely get to see you, and when we do, you're not present, you've... you've got a phone in front of your face -or you're talking about golf. -Golf closes deals. No deals, no meals. Did you just come up with that yourself? -Uh-- -Don't answer that. Listen, I really appreciate all that you do to provide for our family. But I'm getting really tired of surviving on your emotional leftovers. Okay, okay. I'll fix it. Okay, well, why don't you start by taking your little clickety clacketies and marching right back in there and signing us up -for Family Camp? -[chuckles] -What? -You're so cute. -Oh. -No, no, seriously, listen.

What's creepy is your selfie phase. [car engines revving] [car horn blaring] Okay, idiot, let's go. Hey, don't call your kid an idiot.

Hey, family, welcome to camp, last name? -We're the Ackermans with an A. -Ackermans. I don't seem to have an Ackerman here on the list. You made the final payment online, right? -Hmm? Oh my goodness, oh my goodness. Listen, it happens all the time. The good news is, we have yet to turn a family away. -Yeah? -So don't worry.

It's fine, it's fine, it's... it's fine, it's fine. I'm telling you guys, you're gonna love this. [Grace] All right, looks like we're here. [gasps] You guys, it's beautiful. Yeah, it's a luxury resort for possums. [Grace] Guys, this is glamping. Honey, I've always wanted to go glamping. Great, let's go home. I'll throw the Tempur-Pedic in the backyard and you can glamp all you want. -[phone rings] -I second that. [Henry] Wait, this is pretty cool.

Hey, can you do me a favor? Start the car while you grab the kids? No, um, I need you to be here with me. I'm-- I'm literally standing in front of you. [clicks tongue] Okay, I mean, the texting, the sneaking away so you can talk to your clients. I need you to be present. I mean, the whole reason that we're doing this is so that we can have time together as a family. [soft music playing] Hannah is 16 and... and Henry shot up like a foot this spring, and I have no idea how any of this happened. Hey, hey, look at me. I'm here, okay? Uh, my choice would have been Maui. [chuckles] But look at me, wherever you are, that's my paradise. Oh. I promise, I am 100%... "Blessed?" [sighs] I am so happy to hear you say that.

Um, honey, you're gonna be sleeping over there. What, why not by you? Oh, hey, uh, we separated the yurt by gender. [chuckles] Yeah, no offense, but we just met you guys, so, uh, instead of doing background checks, we will just keep things kosher. Mm... -Honey, can we talk a second? -Yeah. What? No Wi-Fi. [chuckles] I can't wait until you realize -there's no air conditioning. -What? I thought you wanted us to be all together, -like a family. -We are together. Come on, it's more campy this way. It smells like old cedar. It smells like an old gerbil cage. -We're changing yurts right now. -Tommy.

Hey, uh, how about we invite you guys to a little Sanders family tradition? Every year, we like to offer up a humble hymn of praise to the Lord and consecrate the yurt as holy ground. -What do you say? -You know, we'd love to, but we're gonna have to make a change. [sighs] I... [mild tempo music playing] Change of key, I can't sing in A major. -[sighs] -Perfect pitch, I see. My friend, that makes two of us. [Victoria] Honey, let's wait a while.

[Victoria] Oh, yeah, we do the WWJE diet -every year at camp. -[Grace] Oh. It's really easy, you just look at your food and go, "Would Jesus really eat this?"

To you, your families and your marriages are what's important. All you kiddos, the reason you're here is 'cause your parents value you more than they do a week on a cruise ship, more than anything.

Will you follow him? -[crickets chirping] -[gerbil squeaks] [Eddie] All right, kids, brush and floss. -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir.

Had this custom case made for it after we set three new records the first year. -[chuckles] -[sighs] Can you believe they used to let folks just take this home, just sitting in their laps? Okay, I'll bite. [sighs] What's a family gotta do to win it? Oh, they gotta be in all the family competitions, gotta compete. The family that takes home the most points at the end of the week takes the cup from my cold, dead hands. [chuckles] It's natural selection for keeping the best families coming back to camp year after year, if you ask me. [scoffs] Didn't peg this place for being evolutionist. Hey, are you crazy? You can't mention the "E" word at a Christian camp. Do you know what could happen to you? Probably a bunch of monkey business. Exactly. [Grace] The Sanders are fun, right? I mean, they're different, but fun. Okay, um... since when is your idea of fun being, um, stranded on Survivor Island with a vegan family gospel band? Come on, they're not that bad. And I don't even know that they're vegan. -Hmm? -Hmm, I mean, let's think about it for a second. We could learn a thing or two from them about essential oils and such, and, who knows, maybe you spend some time -with Dr. Eddie... -[both chuckle] ...and you guys may become BFFs. No. -It could happen. -No, no, okay, -first of all, okay? -Hmm. -Uh, Dr. Eddie... -Mm-hmm. ...is a chiropractor. It means he got his doctorate from a junior college. That's not true, you don't know that. It is true, it's true, I read it, okay? -Hmm. -And second of all, -listen, I love you. -[clicks tongue] Aw. But if you think we're gonna be friends with that guy, you need your head examined. -[scoffs] -No, you do, oh, you know what? Hold on, I got a head examiner right here. Ma'am, if you could just please be still. -Get your toothbrush out of my-- -No, No, I'm gonna, no, I'm gonna examine-- Don't touch my hair with it, -it's disgusting! -Yeah, I'm a professional. [Grace] Did you learn that in junior college? -[Tommy] Yes, I did. [chuckles] -[Grace chuckles] And Lord, thank you for our children. May their lives be a sweet fragrance -unto you, Lord... -Yes. ...and may the aroma of their love just waft up to your throne room, oh, Lord. Oh, no, they're sacrificing their children. -[chuckles] -[indistinct chatter] Hey, maybe they're onto something. [Eddie] There's nothing like a... like a righteous-- What smells like corn nuts in here? -That's my feet. -[Eddie] You blessed my children with a smoking hot mother so they... Our kids aren't really sacrificing material. -Not so much. [chuckles] -[chuckles] -Come on... -Hmm? -...show them how it's done. -Huh, what's done? Yeah, you're gonna bless this mess. -No. -Yes. -I don't-- -Yes, you do, -come on, you're doing it. -Uh. Kids, um, come on, uh, we're gonna... we're gonna say a blessing around you, on... on you. -Why? -[sighs] It's tradition. You're only doing it 'cause you saw the Sanders doing it. -No, we're not. -Come on, come on, huddle up, let's go. Come on, come on.

[camera beeps] Oh, uh, hey, bud, let's... let's, uh, let's do... do it again, okay? [mumbling] No, I know, I know, I just-- I think -you got a better one in you. -[spits] Why is nothing I do ever good enough for you? No, no, let's just... let's just give it another shot, okay? Henry! -Hmm, hmm. -[indistinct chatter] [sighs] [ukulele playing] You know, I still can't believe that the prettiest girl at camp has never been kissed. Well, what, why is that so hard to believe? I mean, it's cool, I'm sure you'll find the right guy. [ukulele playing] [Hannah] Um, okay. -[Tommy] Hey. -Hey. -[sighs] -Tommy Ackerman. [laughs] Did you know you are the only one who hasn't signed up for the Daddy Day Hike? Oh, you should go. I would, but, uh, you know what? The, uh, only reason I came to camp was just to get to spend more time with my family. Well, that's exactly why you need to do it. See, all the dads hike up to Mount Burrow. They gather by themselves and... -[soft music playing] -...listen to God. Sign him up. Excellent! [chuckles] It's the best thing you're gonna do for your family all week. You're awesome. [laughs] All right, Johnsons? [Mr. Johnson] Hey, what's up? [sighs] I really don't know about that guy. I know, I think he spent way too much time at camp. What? Oh, no, no, no, not him. I mean, Justin Bieber over there. -[Tommy] That? -[Grace] Yeah. That's just a camp fling. She'll be over him in a week. [sighs] You know, maybe you should go on this hike, spend a little more time with Eddie. What? He just puts a lot into his family, -and-- -Oh, come on. You minimize things, you know, "Oh, she'll be fine." You're gonna do this, right? This... this is why I came over here, so that you could compare me to Eddie Sanders? Oh, yeah, he's just... he's just the perfect man. He's a much better dad than me, -he's-- -No, no, Tommy, no, I'm sorry... I'm sorry. Honey, that was just an awful thing to say. It's fine, it's fine. I don't think everything's so perfect in the Sanders camp, anyway. [upbeat music playing] [Joel] Families, welcome to day two of the Camp Katokwah Challenge.

[grunts] -Oh. -[crowd gasp] Zero points, Ackerman family takes archery. -Yeah! -No, no! this isn't right! No! No! No! Yes, in your face! My stroke was off, that's not fair. Eddie! [Eddie] No! -Hey, babe. -Oh! -Ow! -Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. -Where'd you get binoculars? -[shushes] What? Uh-oh. You okay? Yeah, why? Nothing, you're just kind of murdering that ice cream cone, is all. I'm stress eating, okay? This is supposed to be Family Camp, not Find-Dumb-Boyfriend Camp. You know, last year, we would share an ice cream and we would be talking about our favorite flavors, oh, but this year, nuh-uh. Instead, she's with some guy whose intentions are God only knows what, and I'm stuck here with a vase full of beads... counting all the days that she should be spending with us, but is instead spending with him, oh. -Brain freeze. [groans] -Hey, hey, come here, come here. Oh! -[cell phone vibrating] -What's that? Nothing. Nothing is buzzing in your back pocket. -Okay. -Look, don't answer it. It's... it's about the promotion. -Just don't answer it. -Two seconds... two, I promise. Hello? -[soft music playing] -Tommy, quick update, just had the most delicious club sandwich with Mr. Kapoor. Well, I'm sorry you didn't choke on it. [Bramberger] Geez Louise, Mr. Kapoor, you are cruising this path like a pro. [laughs] Whoa, whoa, easy there, Danica Patrick. Hey, look, I'll text you later when I seal the-- [chuckles] Steal the deal. You get out of that golf cart right now, do you hear me? Bramberger, Bramberger! -[indistinct chatter] -[grunts] Grace. Grace, hold up. [Grace] No, no, I will not hold up. I have held up for the past five years. I'm sorry. Listen. When we get home, I... I think that we should go to marriage counseling. Oh, come on, we don't need counseling. [scoffs] I knew that's what you'd say. I mean, I knew it. -Grace. -[mild tempo music playing] -[girl] Heads up, watch out! -[grunts] Um... Girl's got a good arm. [Henry] This was clearly a terrible idea. [grunts] [woman] You have reached the voicemail box of... [Alex] Alex Kapoor. [Henry] Dad? I'm scared, I want to come down. Buddy, that's what the repelling gear is for. You're not gonna fall. N... No, I... I don't want to do this anymore. I'm freaking out up here and you don't even care. No. [sighs] Need a little slack in your line? [chuckles] Oh, more than you know. Hey, buddy, mind if I holler at your dad for a minute? Yeah, thanks, I'm coming down. Oh, thank God. -He's a good kid. -Yeah, yeah. Remind me your name again. -Tommy, we go to your church. -Yes. -Golfer, right? -Uh, yeah, yeah, sorry. I think I've been showing up a little late. No, it's all good. Seeing you come in reminds me I only have a minute or two left in the sermon. [chuckles] Well, I deserve that. -Hey, can I be honest with you? -[Dave] Sure. Yeah, um, I think God and I are good. He and I are okay. Uh, it's just, uh... I'm busy, there's a lot going on, and, uh, church is just another thing on my list. Hmm. No judgements here. See, it doesn't matter if you're... if you're old or if you're young. We are all in different spots in our journey with God. -Yeah. -Hey, Tommy, you... you know what a compass does? [Tommy] It tells you where to go? Not exactly, it turns out it only has one basic function. A compass points you to true north, and once you got true north, you can never get lost. Since we're being honest, I'm your pastor. But it's not my job or the church's job to lead your family... it's yours. See, life can pull you in many different directions if you let it, but real talk... [soft music playing] ...it's pretty easy to get lost if you don't have a guide. -Have fun out here. -Yeah. [Eddie] Sanders family, I am proud of you and all the hustle today. We destroyed so many families on the field of battle, including the Ackermans in most events. I know the good Lord is so pleased with us. [crickets chirping] -[Tommy] Eddie? -[Eddie] Mm-hmm? [Tommy] We can hear you. [owl hooting] [Barb] Oh, no, Little Billy Graham is gone. [Tommy] Who's Little Billy Graham? [Eddie] Nobody panic, he's just the smaller gerbil. [Grace] What? [indistinct chatter] [Joel] Gentlemen, welcome to the Ouachita National Forest, One-point-eight million acres across two states. So in light of that, today we are gonna do the buddy system. That means no one goes anywhere without their buddy. -Mm-hmm -So go ahead and pair up. [indistinct chatter] [Joel] Now, Eddie Sanders has volunteered to be the caboose so that we can keep the entire group together. Eddie, who's your lucky buddy? That would be my yurt made, Tommy Ackerman. Oh, no, sorry, Pastor Dave and I were, um... -[chuckles] -Not on the same page All right, let's head out. [sighs] Let's go, bucko. Yeah, did you pack enough for a day hike? Well, it's a little light for an Eagle Scout, but if we get lost, the good Lord always provides. Am I right? I'm right. [harmonica playing] [Tommy sighs] [soft music playing] [indistinct chatter] I have an offer for you, free of charge. I know it's gonna sound too good to be true, but I can't help it, I like you. [sniffs] It's starting to smell like a pyramid scheme. Oh, heavens no. The essential oils are my wife's department. Nay, nay, nay, what the good Lord laid upon my heart is for you to have some mentorship in parenting with me. [chuckles] It'll be the best five years of your life. People don't call me the mentoring Miyagi -for nothing. -Mm-hmm. Name one person who calls you Miyagi. Alto, you stay right here and think about it. I'm gonna hop off the trail to the little boy's room. Okay, hey. Hurry up, I don't want to get left behind. [Eddie] Ah, I don't want to get bit by any bugs. Oops, that's poison ivy. Come on, come on. [sighs] -[whistles] -Aha. Sweet manna from heaven. [mild tempo music playing] [bees buzzing] Daddy's bringing home the honey. [chuckles] [Eddie screaming] [Eddie] Run, run! [whimpers] -Get that thing away from me! -My skin is on fire! -Get away from me! -[Eddie screams] It's free! -Get rid of it! -[screams] It's free organic honey! [screams] -[Eddie whimpers] -That's a co-pay. [both scream, pant] [both pant] Man, my face stings so bad. Do you see anything? No, no, I don't, mm-mm, no. You look... you look good. You look good. Oh, praise God, I prayed for a hedge of protection and the good Lord always comes through every time. Um, yeah, if you stop breathing, just say something, okay? -Ten-four. [breathes deeply] -Okay, great, great, great. -Hey, um, that, uh... -[Eddie gasps] ...that fort back there, I was thinking-- -[both groan] -[suspenseful music playing] Eddie! Eddie, Eddie? Quick, give me a shot of epinephrine in my pouch. [Tommy] Geez, how much stuff you got-- Oh, found it. Okay, hold on... Okay, now what? Before you stab me, you need to massage my thigh. -Um, nope. -Do you want me to die? Hmm, well-- You have to massage my leg in the spot where you're gonna stab me in for at least ten seconds -or it does not work. -Okay. [groans] -[groans] -[Eddie whimpers] Oh, oh, that feels kind of nice. -Please stop talking. -[whimpers, pants] Okay, uh, you might want to, I don't know, -say a prayer or something. -[Eddie] Okay, all right, let me grab my keys. [both scream] -My hand! [groans] -You put in there! [gasps, pants] -Do it again. -Again? You have to stab me in the legs or the buttocks or it does not work. The legs it is, let me dust this off real quick. No, no, no, I have a second pen in here. -[gasps] -Of course you do. -Oh, hey. [groans, whimpers] -Okay, okay. -I'm starting to see Heaven. -No. Hey, hey, Uncle Roy, is that you? Do you still make those flapjacks? I want some flapjacks, Uncle Roy. -No, tell Roy to go away. -Make it big flapjacks, -Uncle Roy. -No, no, don't take those. Melt that butter, Uncle Roy. Don't. You tell Roy to get away. Roy, get away! The kitchen's closed. [screams] [indistinct chatter] Hmm. -Huh? -[pants] -Wow, that thing works fast. -[chuckles] Yeah, that is pure adrenalin, my friend. -[mild tempo music playing] -Hey, I want to go for a run. You want to go for a run? I want to go for one, let's go for a run! Okay, hot pants, why don't you... Come on! [yelps] [sighs] [Grace] Uh, finally, some mother daughter time-- -Okay, okay, careful, Mom. -[Grace] Ooh, that is slippery. [Hannah] All right, okay, Mom, okay, Mom. [Grace] Just whatever you do, -don't let go. -[Hannah] Okay. -[Corbin] Hey, there. -Oh, hey. [screams] -Want to toss the 'bee around? -Yeah, sure. Um, hey, Mom? Mom? [dramatic music playing] Oh, okay, is it cool if I go hang with Corbin? -Thanks. -[Corbin] After you. Thank you, so how have you been? [Corbin] Uh, yeah, pretty good. [Grace grunts] Come on, come on, God. I'm good. [snorts] [snorts] -Hey. -Hmm? -Were you tickling my face? -[scoffs] Yeah, I was, I tried shaking you violently, but all that did was make me feel good. [sighs] That's the way. [mild tempo music playing] [Tommy] That is not a trail. [Eddie] The trail winds to the left up there quite a bit and I'm 100% positive that if we cut through these woods, we will find ourselves back on the trail and probably ahead of the group. [sighs] [sighs] Hey, buddy, come on. [chuckles] This is our story to tell our wives, how we braved the wilderness and fought our way back home. [grunts] Come on. Come on. [whistles] Come, come. Okay, but quit talking to me like I'm a dog. -[Eddie] Good boy, Tommy. -Stop it. Eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen... Has anyone seen Tommy or Eddie? -[confused chatter] -Tommy, Eddie? Oh, no. [bird cawing] [Tommy groaning] I should have known better than to trust you. You have no idea where we are. Well, good luck crossing that. [Eddie] I've crossed it a dozen times. That, you've crossed that? Things like it. [mild tempo music playing] [Eddie] Mentorship tip numero uno, never ask your kids to do something that you aren't willing to do yourself. In this illustration, I will play the brave father that has already conquered the river, and you will play the scared little boy. Just picture yourself as Henry. Yeah, please don't talk about my son. [sighs] Your son, he's the quiet, reclusive type. If I've seen it once, I've seen it 100,000 times. If you do not get a handle on this, you're gonna have a hoarder for a son. Hey, Eddie, shut your mouth before I shut it for you. Today, he is a quiet little bookworm. Tomorrow, he is stuck in an apartment with a bunch of junk that he bought at a home shopping channel with your credit card, bucko. -Hey, Eddie. -Yeah? [groans] [Eddie] No, no! -[grunts] -Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [sighs] My glasses. -[grunts] -[chuckles] No, not my mustache! [gurgles] [ominous music playing] [yells] -[grunts] -[gasps, grunts] -I am a chiropractor! -[Tommy gasping] [coughing] -[Tommy] You're so dead. -You don't know me. No, who consecrates a yurt with a harmonica song? I do, I do with pleasure, with pleasure. Well, it's not pleasurable to anyone else! You don't know anything! Anything, anything, anything! [Grace groaning] Uh... [Grace groans] Mind if I join you? Sure. [Victoria] Do you want to talk about it, -or-- -No, no, I don't. [Victoria] Okay. I mean, no offense, but, like, your marriage is just a little too perfect for me to, you know, talk to you about my marriage. So I'm just, I'm not even gonna go there. [sobs] You know, like, here's the thing, okay? I thought that we would come here and that my family would just magically become the family that I've always wanted them to be. [sniffles] Whatever you think about me and my family, uh, you know, things get a lot more complicated when you get a peek behind the curtain, so. [chuckles] Oh, please, you're like the perfect Christian family. You even eat like Jesus would eat, for crying out loud. [sighs] We're kind of falling apart. Ooh, I just said that out loud. We're falling apart. Uh. Okay, um... go on. I'm really good at keeping our secret and I put a smile on at church and I pray and I pray and I pray, Grace, I pray, and I have no voice. I have no voice in my marriage, and Eddie controls everything, everything. And I give my opinions, but it's like he doesn't even care, you know, he doesn't even listen. And I don't even have the strength to make him care, you know? [sighs] And I don't know how much longer I can go on feeling like... I don't matter. I did not see that coming. -Sorry, that was like, blah. -[Grace] Oh, no, it's okay. Ladies, I don't mean to interrupt, but we have a problem. -Get in line. [laughs] -[laughs] Oh, you're serious. [harmonica playing] I can't find my lunch anywhere. So let me get this straight. You've got these anti-hypothermia space age blankets in your backpack, you've got an epinephrine shot, a backup epinephrine shot, but you got no map, no compass, nothing? -Correctamundo. -[chuckles] -[stomach growls] -Oh, my stomach just ate itself. [Eddie] Oh, I forgot to mention that my blood sugar was getting a little low, so I ate your lunch. Come again? I was addressing a medical need. Hey, it's okay, mi amigo. When God closes a door, he opens a Chick-fil-A. [chuckles] So you stole my lunch? This is amazing, you realize we could die out here, right? Whoa, bucko, hey, we don't need to look at it that way. We need to look at this as an opportunity to grow our faith. You know what, the only reason I came on this stupid hike was to grow my faith. -Hey, let it out. -[Tommy] Okay, I will. You know, I thought maybe I'd come out here, he'd say something, he'd show me something. Instead, I'm stuck here with Dr. Phil's demented twin brother when I should be back at the camp singing "Kumbaya" with my family. How's that make you feel? I'll tell you how it makes me feel, all right? I feel like if God is in control of all this, then I don't know if I'm really that interested in faith. [harmonica playing] Please stop that. -[Eddie] Stop what? -[harmonica playing] That. Stop this? -[harmonica playing] -Yes, that. Can't. -[Tommy] May I see that? -Hmm? Can I see that? Thanks. -[bird squawks] -[Tommy chuckles] [mild tempo music playing] What you gonna do now, little bald man? -[screeches] -[grunts] [screams] -[grunts] -[cell phone trilling] [Tommy] You've reached Tommy Ackerman, senior investment strategist for Wiley and Edmund. -I'm not available right now. -[indistinct chatter] [Joel clears throat] So we've got the sheriff's office, Park Services, and great team of volunteers searching for your husbands right now. They're gonna be out there for two hours... but they're gonna hit it again, first light. And then what? You know, these guys are really good at what they do. I think the best thing for right now -is if y'all stay put. -We stay put, sure. We just sit still, stay put, thank you for that. We'll just stay put while our husbands are out there that have never been out there before, like... Joel? [soft music playing] [sighs] Hey, Grace? They're coming back. You hear me? I really believe that. I know that. I'm gonna pray for us, okay? Okay. Sometimes I like to pray in my prayer language, -is that all right? -Um, you mean like in tongues? -Like in Spanish. -Oh, -yeah, that's good, that's good. -[Victoria chuckles] [sighs] [praying in Spanish] [continues praying] -My dad plays the harmonica. -Hmm, sounds like a good man. He never really came around much. Still doesn't. [sighs] And if I'm honest, I'm just living out my greatest fear of becoming just like him. And the older my kids get... I realize, I... I don't know them. This may surprise you to hear this, but, uh... I was afraid to have kids. My parents, they did the best they could, but they didn't really leave me with the best blueprint to raise my own kids with. [sighs] And then I saw the twins in the delivery room... holding each other... and this... extra valve in my heart opened up, one I didn't even know I had. [chuckles] I love them so much. And yet, I'm still afraid I'm gonna mess them up somehow. My grandmother always said it's, uh, family... it's God's plan and our responsibility. -Hmm. I like that. -Hmm. Yeah. Don't worry, mi amigo, we are going to find our way back home to our families, I promise. Now, that's a roaring fire. [Tommy] Oh, quick, get them off! -[Eddie] I'm trying! [grunts] -[Tommy grunts] -[Eddie] Ouch. -Hot! -[Eddie] Stomp them out! -[Tommy] Hot! -My leg hairs! -[Eddie] Not today, Satan! -No, no. -[groans] Oh, they look good. -Do they? -Yeah. [man over walkie talkie] Okay, Rescue Alpha. We're gonna call it a night. We'll be back at 0500. Okay. Look, I know I don't ask for much, God... because... you know, I like to do everything myself. [whimpers] But it turns out... that I really love him and, um, and I need him, so... please bring him home. [somber music playing] [Tommy groans, sniffles] [groans] -Good morning. -Hey, morning. -Hope I didn't wake you. -No. [Eddie] How do I look? -Fantastic. -That's right, fantastic. -Mom, Mom! [pants] -What? [Hannah] Henry's gone. It says he went to go find dad. [siren wailing] [indistinct chatter] Okay, we believe the boy is most likely in this area here, and the chances of survival in this forest are falling by the hour for all three of them, so we gotta move. -[indistinct chatter] -Grace, Grace! -Grace. Grace! -[Grace] What? [Joel] I can't let you go in there. [scoffs] You say that like you can stop me. My son is out there. I understand, that's why we're doubling our efforts. Yeah, that's great, it's just not good enough, it's not. [Joel] Grace, that's not just some city park you're walking into there. It's the Ouachita National Forest, some of the roughest terrain you'll ever encounter, Grace! God knows every square inch of it. He knows where they are. [soft music playing] So when is he gonna tell us? Cookie, I need to borrow your truck. -What for? -It's an emergency. Oh, it sounds like my kind of party. [clattering] [Cookie] So, where are we going? [Joel] We've got a little boy to go rescue. [Eddie] Mentorship lesson numero dos. Tell me about this, uh, cell phone that you always seem to be on. [Tommy] This is amazing, we're here in the middle of the woods, and yet I still seem to have a nagging wife. [Eddie] Well, at least you have a wife that cares enough to nag. [Tommy] Um, it's my job, right? I mean, some people work in construction, some people work in a classroom. I do most of my work on the phone. [Eddie] How do you set boundaries? For what? Well, I mean, if you work in a construction yard, you wouldn't be driving the bulldozer to the dinner table, now would you, no. Try using the sharp side. Hmm, hmm. Yeah, it's not that easy, okay? I'm up for a promotion. If I get it, it changes everything, right? I mean, who doesn't want to not have to worry about money? Get a new house, a new car, don't have to worry about retirement, I mean-- -ATVs! [chuckles] -ATVs? -Hmm, what, ATVs? -Help, somebody! Please help! Hey, hey, hey, come on, let's go. [mild tempo music playing] No, no, this has "Thou shalt not steal." Written all over it. We can cover ten times the area with these, okay? We'll be back by dinner. Four wheelers just don't appear in the middle of nowhere. They belong to somebody. Okay, okay. I'm sorry, I just, I missed my family, and I'm so hungry. Tonight is taco night. No, it's stealing. I forgot about the guacamole. No, no, it's wrong. [mild tempo music playing] [Henry] Dad? [bird chirping] Dad! [leaves rustling] [crows cawing] Hello? Okay, I'm done waiting, we're losing daylight. -It's now or never. -Hmm. -[dart whooshes] -[groans] -Did you say something? [yelps] -[dart whooshes] Well, hey, little fella. Who's daddy's big boy? I'm daddy's big boy. [Eddie] Tommy? Tommy! Tommy! -Tommy! -Please, stop screaming. -My head's killing me. -My legs feel like jelly. [Slim] That's the tranquilizer. Now it's rated for a 700-pound primate. You're liable to feel a little weak -in the knees for a spell. -Wait, I know you guys. Yeah, yeah, you're on that, uh, you're on that TV show, -The Bigfoot Hunters. -Always nice to meet a fan. They tried to steal our ATVs, -you cornball joker. -[gasps] I retract my statement. We're... we're not... we're not thieves. We're just trying to get back to our families. But, you see, I got one little -teensy tiny problem. -One. You see, I ain't never met a thief who weren't a liar. Wow, I could sew that on a pillow. -Thank you. -I'm sorry, um, -were you calling him a liar? -I did. That man is my friend and he is no liar, and if you're calling him a liar, you're calling me a liar, and nobody calls me a liar. -Stop talking. -You know what, we're fine. You can go on your way, just skedaddle. Good day, sirs. I said good day. [Slim] All right. -No, no, no, no, no. -Bye now. He... he's just kidding, okay? We... we love your show, we do. -Oh. -[Eddie] I'm not kidding, fame has gone to your head. No one watches your TV show, now scram. -[exhales] -[Slim] Come on. Please tell them you're kidding. -Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. -[Slim] Give me your honey pot. -But you said you wasn't hungry. -The honey pot ain't for me, you doofus McSpaz-a-tron, come on. Hand it over. [mild tempo music playing] Now. [laughs] Now, these woods, this is home to a lot more than just deer and coyote. Mm, mm, mm. Now, we'll come back and untie you in a day or two when we're done squatching, that is... if you ain't already been tooked. [Tommy] Please don't go! -That was scary. -[chuckles] Please, don't leave us! Look on the bright side, we got our honey, huh? You don't understand, they were our last hope. I'm starting to think you don't want to be rescued. Well, clearly I was using reverse psychology, and clearly I still need some practice at it. The only thing that is clear to me is how clueless you actually are. I mean, you can't be normal for one minute, can you? Everything that comes out of your mouth causes every bit of me to cringe. It... it's like... It... it's like your head is just a... a giant cheese grater and I'm lactose intolerant. When you open up your mouth, it's just grade A cheddar just starts coming out. It's just. [imitates vomiting] And in the midst of all of that, I have to ask this question, who... who greets people by giving them back adjustments? Who in the world does that? -Well, I do. -Listen, do me a favor. The next time you have something that you just have to say, don't, because nobody wants to hear you. I get it. I get it. [sighs] You're the guy that always gets picked, right? [somber music playing] [Eddie] Never left standing there, the third wheel in a bunch of two-man buddy systems. Always invited to lunch, always invited to the parties. And then there's me. Clueless, cringey... not normal Eddie Sanders. I've got news for you. God doesn't make junk, and that includes me. No matter what you may think of me... I'm not junk. [Hannah] I just don't know what I would do... -if it was just me and mom. -Look, they're gonna find them. Everything will be okay, I'm sure of it. What are you... what are you doing? -Come on, don't be a tease. -Excuse me? Uh, okay, cool, um, I'll catch you around, I guess. [scoffs] [gasps] [sobs] Wha... what? [screams] Yeah, see you around, I guess. -[Grace] Henry! -[Joel] Henry! [Grace] Henry! [man on walkie talkie] Headquarters here, go ahead, -Rescue Alpha. -[radio static] [Rescue Alpha] We're setting it down for the night. The trail ran cold over an hour ago and the dogs are getting tired. [soft music playing] [grunts] [sobs] -[crickets chirping] -[owl hooting] -[leaves rustle] -[gasps] Hello? Dad? Is that you? Come on, come on, come on, come on. I got you on camera, so you can just come out... [wolf howling] ...please? [mild tempo music playing] -[grunts, pants] -[leaves rustling] [wolves howling] Wolves? [pants] Wolves, wolves, help, help! There's wolves! [screams] [Joel] Henry? [Eddie snores] -[grass rustling] -[snorts] [suspenseful music playing] Hey, I'm really sorry about what I said earlier. -It's fine, whatever. -I just don't want to die out here. [Eddie] It may be happening sooner than you think. [beaver grunts] -Oh, well, hello, little fella. -[beaver sniffs] Who's a good boy? [groans] [sobs] I need one more chance. I get it now. Grace, Hannah, Henry... they need me. And I think for the first time in my life... I'm ready. I'm ready, God. I've been going in so many directions. I need to find true north. So if you'll have me... I'll give you everything. [sniffles] Just please give me one more chance. [beaver clicking] [grunts] Eddie, Eddie, the ropes, they just broke, it's a miracle! -[chuckles] -Oh. Well, well, yeah, it's a miracle. [chuckles] I mean, it's been like a... a nonstop prayer service on this side of the tree. Have you been crying? You've been crying. A little help? [birds chirping] [soft music playing] -[sobs] -Mom, Mom! Henry. [sobs] [Henry] I'm so sorry, I looked for him all night. -I tried so hard. [sobs] -[sobs] I couldn't find him. Sorry. Thank you. Me and you are gonna have kids like that one day. Hmm? [coughs, clears throat] [birds chirping] [suspenseful music playing] [Beef snores] [snores] I don't feel good about this. It's our only chance, come on. [snores] Hmm. [gasps] They've got cheddar wieners. -[snores, snorts] -Get over here. Do you want one? See, Mr. Beef, I told you them was thieves. Beef. Beef. -[grunts] -Morning. [coughs] [Slim] Put him in a choker, will you? Thought you could pull one over on us. No, look ahead. -[grunts] Hi. -Oh, hello again. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [chuckles] You wouldn't want to leave your friend behind now, -would you? -Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. Come on, now, step away from it nice and slow like. Yeah, nice and slow like. [Slim] Well, well, well. What we gonna do with these two now? Don't do anything crazy, okay? Just, um, think... think about your TV show. -Oh, show's over. -Huh? Yeah, the network canceled it. Is it because you couldn't find bigfoot? You watch it too? Let me ask you something. You know what it's like to have your dream come true reality TV show canceled, huh? Do you? Do you! Uh, it's... it's just a really specific question. No, huh, no. Well, it's very difficult. [grunts] It's very difficult. And now I think I'm gonna have to cancel you. Wait, that was unloaded the whole time? [screams] Bigfoot! -What? -Where, where? -Eddie, run! -[screams] [screams] -I'll never walk again! -Sir, please don't go. -[Eddie] No, you don't. L2. -[grunts] -[Eddie] L4. And sleep. -[grunts, groans] -Eddie, you're a murderer. -No, Tommy, I'm a chiropractor. Oh, oh. [rock music playing] Come on! You are not Rambo. [pants] Pull to the left, baby. [gasps] [exhales, gasps] Drive! -Come on, it's gonna blow! Whoa! -[Beef] I got you, little Squatchie. [both scream, pant] [both wail] -[chuckles] -[chuckles] That was amazing, -Eddie, you did it. -No, we did it. [both laugh, cheer] [sniffs] [beaver clicking] -Stop, stop, beaver, stop! -[beaver clicking] -Whoa! -[Eddie] Watch out! [beaver screams] [both scream] [both grunt, groan] [beaver groans] -[Tommy groans] -[screams] [Eddie] Bees, uh, I hate you, I hate you, bees. I hate them, I hate the bees! [screams] Hey, hey, hey, hold on, hold on. If that's the bees... -this is the trail -We found the trail? -We found the trail. -We found the trail. [both cheer, laugh] [both] We found the trail, we found the trail! [both] We found the trail, we found the trail. [both] We found the trail, we found the trail. [both grunting rhythmically] [mild tempo music playing] -That just happened. -Yeah. [birds chirping] Oh, let me gather this stuff right here. -I'll help you. -You get going here, okay? No, you don't need to help. -No, it's good. -You don't need to help, -I got-- I just need to-- -[Tommy] I got it. What is this? I didn't know it was in there. Hey. Hey! Look me in the eyes -and say that. -[sighs] I... I didn't know-- Okay, okay. We were never really lost. I, uh... I knew where we were the whole time. Of course you did. -You see, the truth is-- -No. Don't. I don't want to hear it. Victoria doesn't love me anymore! [Tommy sighs] What are you talking about? She... she doesn't love me anymore. We're just... we're just roommates, just... just raising our kids. Divorce isn't an option, so we just exist. [soft music playing] She doesn't even want to be around me... [sobs] ...so I just, uh, I just thought if... if they'd think... [sobs] ...that I was hurt or even dead and then miraculously returned, -then things would be-- -No, no, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Let me make sure I understand this. You're stuck in a passionless marriage... so you dragged me, a complete stranger, into this twisted, manipulated, made up story. You almost get the both of us killed. At the least, you wreck our wives and children, for what? So you can come in and sweep her off her feet? Hmm, well, I don't know about sweeping her off her feet, but I really thought if we could-- Your wife was right. No, we have to finish this together. -We're finished. -I can't go back by myself. You stay away from me. Oh, God, no. -[Joel] Hey. Here you go. -[gasps] Thank you. [Hannah] Hey, come on, it's dad! [Joel] There he is. [crowd applaud] [Grace] Tommy? Tommy! -Tommy! -Grace, Grace! -Tommy, Tommy? -Grace? -[chuckles] -[crowd cheer, applaud] I thought you were-- I'm never leaving you again, never. [sobs] [Hannah] Dad! -Oh, come here. -[all chuckle] [Henry] I was looking for you in the woods all night by myself. -What? -[Henry] Um. I'm sorry, I just wanted you to be proud of me. [exhales deeply] I couldn't be more proud of you. You're perfect just the way you are. -Hi. -I love you, sweetheart. -I love you. -Oh. [all sob] Where is he? Where's Eddie? -[Victoria] Papi. -[Eddie Jr.] Dad! -[pants] -[chuckles] [chuckles] Let's go. [Victoria] I thought you weren't coming back. [sobs] What you got there? I was thinking about that jar with all of those beads in it, and I think it's just a really terrible idea. [birds chirping] Me too. [chuckles] [sighs] How about instead of taking beads out, we put beads in for every day that we have with each other from this moment on? Mom, I'm gonna need you my first day of college. I'm gonna need you for my first real job... for my first serious boyfriend. [both chuckle] Mom, I'm gonna need you for everything. [chuckles] [Hannah chuckles] So-- [chuckles] [soft music playing] -[Eddie] You see the kids? -[Victoria sighs] Oh, I told them to get us a seat next to Tommy and Grace. Oh, no, bad idea. Why don't we just let them have their own personal space for the last night of camp -because that's a big deal. -Hey, Eddie? I need to talk... and I just... I need you to just listen, okay? I've been praying for God to change some things... in our marriage. But what I realized is that the change starts with me. God calls husbands to love their wives like Christ loves the church-- -Vic, let's be real clear-- -[Victoria] Eddie... God doesn't control us. He doesn't make all the decisions for us. He doesn't take away our voice. And he loves... what I have to say. [chuckles] That is what I need. [sighs] I need my voice back. -Let's hear it for the Brewers! -[audience cheers, applauds] [Dave] Woo-woo, sugar bear! [chuckles] Look at that. Now, our next award is the Badge of Courage. Now, this comes as no surprise. You've all heard the story of heroism and the conquering of nature. Well, this award is being given to... [drum rolling] ...Eddie Sanders... -[gasps] -...for saving Tommy from choking to death in the first night of camp. [audience cheers, applauds] Thank you, Cookie. Don't go anywhere, Eddie. You see, that Badge of Courage has earned you -an extra 10,000 points... -[audience gasps] ...making the Sanders the winners of the Camp Katokwah Cup for the third year in a row! -[audience cheers, applauds] -[upbeat music playing] [Eddie] Mind if I say something? No. Friends, um... thank you for this great honor, but, um... I... I can't accept it. Um... [sighs] [sighs] I'm... I'm a fake. I've made my wife miserable. Vic, you're right. I have not loved you like Christ loved the church. And I am so sorry. That's on me, that's on me. I'm gonna go down there, okay? The perception I've made of my family, uh... well, it's a trophy... it's a golden idol, which, um... -well, it makes me, uh... -[Tommy] A liar? Yeah. The truth is I... I got the two of us lost in the woods. [sighs] And I did it on purpose. [indistinct chatter] [suspenseful music playing] An ill-conceived attempt to try to win the affections back from my wife, I'm sorry. [sighs] -Hey, hey, here, I got it. -Hmm? I got it. -[sighs, clears throat] -[soft music playing] I think, um, when we were in the forest... I think we both learned a lot about life... [clears throat] ...faith... and family. That wouldn't have happened if we didn't get lost in the woods. See, I told you, God had a plan. -Shut it. -Okay. -[Tommy] Seriously. -Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um. What I'm trying to say is, uh... I've been forgiven a lot. So how can I not forgive? Yeah. Hey. I forgive you. -Hmm, me? -Yeah, you. [chuckles] [audience cheers, applauds] [sighs] -You deserve this. -Oh, I know. [both chuckle] [audience cheers, applauds] [Grace] Come on, guys. You were terrible at bubble ball, but you are great at everything else. Thank you for hearing me. You're worth listening to. -So you'd better get used to it. -[chuckles] I love you. I love you, too, Eddie Sanders. -[sniffles] -[chuckles] [indistinct chatter] -Hey. -Hmm? You wanna play us out?
