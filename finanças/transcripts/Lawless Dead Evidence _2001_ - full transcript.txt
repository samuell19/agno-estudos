(dog barking) (high heels clicking) (car engine rumbling) (horn honks) (crowd cheering) (women grunting) (energetic rock music) (woman yells) (man cheering) - You've had your fun, now put her down. - Says who? (grunting) - [Jelly Wrestler] I'll kill the bastard. - [Crowd] Fight, fight, fight, fight! (men groaning) - [Crowd] Oh! (crowd cheering) (tires screech) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - No, no! - You're dead! (screaming) (dramatic music) - [Woman] No, no! (tires screeching) (man groans) - Don't come back! (crowd laughing) (suspenseful music) (woman moaning) (tires screech) (smooth jazzy music) - Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Shit! Oh! Hi! Oh sorry, I didn't hear you come in. - Oh, coffee? Give her yours. There you go. - Oh, no, no, it's fine. It could be the same man, couldn't it? He tried to inject her. - Cops don't even buy the girl's story. They're calling it a hit and run. - Yeah, but it says here that she was hitching, and it's the same area. - I'd be stealing your money. Maybe it's time to accept the fact that your husband's gonna be inside for a very long time. Start getting on with your life. Jodie? Why don't you nip out and check the post office? - Dean is my life. - What harm would there be? - Well, stupid bitch spent every last cent she had on the last appeal. She's too stuck on that murdering Yank hubby of hers to pay in kind. Pity, she's quite tasty. Where you going? - Post office. - Hold your horses, no point in going, now. (knocking) - Mrs. Riley? Trina, look, I'm sorry about that. Mr. Roach, he's pretty tied up with lots of other cases, you know? But maybe I could help. Doing background for your husband's appeal? If you want. (Trina chuckles) - No offense, but I thought you were just like, the office girl. - Point taken. In this business it pays not to look like who you are. - I guess not. Well, so what do you think? - Uh... - Look, ever since Dean went to prison, I've been watching the papers. Every time a girl goes missing. I mean, the guy really killed Leanne Sutcliffe, he's still out there. I mean, he could do it again, right? - I suppose it's possible. - Well, so when I read about this girl, she's hitching, guy picks her up. He tries to inject her. - Cops say it was a hit and run. - Yeah, but why would she make something like that up? - I have no idea. - Well, it's the same area. I mean, it's the same time of night. - It was five years since Leanne was murdered. - Nearly six. Gemma was just a toddler. - So, what's this guy been doing since? - I don't know. Maybe other girls have gone missing and it hasn't been reported? I don't know, because if I knew that, I wouldn't need your help, would I? Hey look, Dean's no saint, and he does stand out a bit, you know? Well, 'cause he's American and well, he is a bit different. But I know him, and I know what's in his heart. Hey look, if this is just too difficult for you, why don't you just say so? - No, no, I'm sorry. I just need to get the background details. (car engine revving) Shit! (bright instrumental music) (group chattering) (groans) - There you go. Jim. - Hi John. - Good morning. - You look gorgeous. - Thanks. - Hello, stranger. Jodie, long time no see. - Yeah, hi. So, you're really working here? - Yeah, looks like it. - How come you never returned any of my phone calls? I thought you'd left the country and said you were dead. - Well, that should check out. - Your landlord said if I find you I could mention the three weeks rent you owe. - What do you want? - You. I need your help. Classy place you got here. Hey look, I'm working with a private investigator, Brendan Roach, you know him? - Yeah, cockroach. They gave him the boot. - Happens to the nicest people. - He was giving it to a hooker in the interview room and taped it. - Anyway, he's landed this case on me. Dean Riley, do you remember him? - Yeah, murdered a girl, buried her body in a forest up north. - His wife's totally convinced he's innocent. - And this has what to do with me? - I don't know, I just thought you might... (woman giggling) - Hey, sorry folks, private room. Look, I've gotta get back out front. - Will you help me, Lawless? - I've got a job. - I thought you were gonna open up your own agency? - Yeah, well, it didn't work out that way. Look, I wouldn't stick around too long if I was you. Once the wrestling starts, the punters get a bit overheated. - Lawless. (energetic rock music) John! You know what it's like to be accused of a crime you didn't commit. - Yeah, well, I'd have maybe worked on the case, but I meant what Riley did to the girl. - Well, if that's the case, then help me prove it. I don't know where to start. - Well, tell Roach to get off his fat arse then! - You know, you came to me for help once and I didn't throw it back in your face. (John sniffs) Fine. - Jodie... (man burps) Piss off! Jodie! (grunting) (man retches) - [Crowd] Oh! (grunting) (spectator laughing) (breathing heavily) - Shit. (distant siren wailing) (phone ringing) - Damn! Jodie Keane. Sorry Brendan, no, no, I'm stuck on the freeway. There's a huge pileup, cars everywhere. Okay, as soon as I can! Bye! You prick! Sorry. (woman chattering) (phone ringing) - Dave Bruford. Jay, you're back, eh? Um, no, not yet. - And did you hear about your old boss? - Snow? - Made inspector. - Here's me thinking writing a cheque gets you nowhere. Does everyone still think I'm a no good junkie dealer? - Nah, you know what it's like. Someone's always leaving for one reason or another. Today's staff bulletin, tomorrow's fish and chips. - Yeah. Hey listen, I've been asked to dig up a little background on Dean Riley. - You working properly? - Not officially. - Well, Dean Riley's a nasty piece of work who is inside right now for torturing and murdering a 19 year old girl. What else you want to know? - No loose ends? - Well, you know who ran the investigation, don't you? - [John] That was before my time. - It was Snow. Look, you just keep your head down, all right? Sooner or later, Snow's gonna forget about you. You can get your license, do what you always talked about. If you start stirring stuff up now, you're not gonna help anyone, are you? - You're right about that. - The cops didn't believe me. They reckon I walked out in front of a car and got splattered. - Try me. - Well, I was hitching and this guy stopped. - What sort of car was it? - Oh, I don't know. Something big and flash, like out of a movie. I remember thinking it'd be cool cruising into town in it. - And what then? - It gets kind of fuzzy. I get these flashes of trying to fight this guy off, and... - You said he tried to inject you? - Maybe, but well, that could've been later at the hospital. (laughs) I thought one of the doctors was trying it on. - Do you remember what the guy who picked you up looked like? - I wish I could forget. - Go on. - A skull. - Excuse me? - Just a skull! No flesh, and like these burning red embers where his eyes should've been. (sighs) Or that could've been the acid. - Sorry Brendan, the traffic was unbelievable, it was totally bump... - Hi. - Hi. - Well, it was nice chatting to you, Roachy. Better get moving, huh? - I'll just, um... - Stay. I value my license. It's important to me. Probably because it's how I earn my living. - I can explain. - So when I hear that the office chick is running around pretending to be working for me, it's disturbing, to say the least. - I was just trying to... - Especially on a case I distinctly remember turning down. (Jodie sighs) - Well, this could be a wrinkle for getting me fired, even for you. - Somehow I got the impression you were working as an investigator and not just the typist. Oh, "The Art of the Profile," "The Criminal Mind." - Some of us aren't afraid to grow, John. Still here, eh? - So, are you dumping the Riley appeal or what? (Jodie laughs) - Well, now I've got some time on my hands. - I've been doing some checking around. - Oh, really? I thought you had a job. - Do you want my help or not? - A, it's the least you could do, B, I asked you, didn't I? And C, I'll think of a C. - So, what have we got so far? (suspenseful music) (laughing) - [Guard] Riley, a visitor. - I'm just gonna tell you one time, cowboy. You ought to stay the hell away from my wife, or I will have the crap kicked out of you. You got that? - Yeah. - Good. - So, you reckon you were set up then? Detective Inspector Snow is in charge of your case. - What about it? - Let's just say it wouldn't be the first time he set the wrong guy up. - You know that little weasel? - Yeah, I used to work for him undercover. - You're a cop? - We had a falling out over our working methods. - I hate that prick! - You'll get no argument from me there. If your appeal is gonna have a hope in hell, proving a lapse in police procedure might be the way to go, all right? - Why the hell are you doing this? We ain't got not money left. - I've got my reasons. Now, you tell me, am I wasting my time here, Dean? - I'm innocent. Just like every other sorry asshole in this place. What the hell do you think I'm gonna say? - Listen, I just didn't pick your name out of a hat. - I gave Leanne a ride and I dropped her off, only no one seen me do that. No one's seen her alive again, except the sumbitch that did that to her. - So, you knew Leanne? - I've seen her around. She was a cute kid. Look, I've done some bad things in my life. I ain't saying I haven't, but I met Trina and I started over. So you just take them dirty little dogs of yours and stick 'em right up your ass. - What bad things? What bad things? (birds chirping) Listen, the cops hounded on Dean for exactly the same reasons I would've. - You've lost me. - It seems our down home cowboy isn't exactly all mom and apple pie. Dean was charged once before for assault and rape. (suspenseful music) - Does Trina know? - Apparently. - [Jodie] Why didn't she say something? - [John] Maybe she just didn't want to talk about it. - Look, Dean was really young. You know, there were other boys involved. - A gangbang, it just gets better. - Dean was the one that went to the police. I mean, he just, he couldn't live with what he'd done. - So he was a guilty rapist? - Oh look, he had a hard time growing up. He hardly even got to go to school. And his father used to beat the hell out of him every day. - That's awful Trina, but it's still no excuse. - Oh, look, when I was 19, my girlfriend wanted to drive across America, and so we saved up our money and we went. One day we were in Amarillo, which is in Texas. Our car broke down. This guy came and he fixed the car, and took us back to his house. It was Dean. Well, he didn't touch either one of us, but he could've! (Trina sobbing) Before we got married, he told me everything about himself. He told me about the rape. He told me everything, but he didn't have to do that, you know? But he did it, he did it because he wanted me to know that he turned his life around. (Trina sobbing) It's just not enough. - So, do you think your lawyers could give us access to files from the original case and appeal? (sniffing) - Yeah. - Imagine what it's like to love someone that much, to believe in them no matter what, (sighs) me neither. What if we're being sucked in badly? It's like every case study I've read progressing from teen rape to murder. - Dean made a mistake, people can change. - Aren't you the big softie? Oh, hang on, I forgot my bag. (dramatic music) (horn honking) (breathing heavily) - How's it going? - I'm always doing that. (laughs) What? - Dave Bruford. (car engine rumbling) - What are you doing? - The girl claims she was picked up by a big car just passed the gas station. - Driven by the Devil, apparently. - She jumped out of the passenger door, lands in the road about here. - Yeah, that's the story. - Yeah, except she lands to the right of the center line, and judging from the amount of skin that was left, it's pretty clear that's where she landed. - What's wrong with that? - Well, if she jumped out of the passenger door, she would've landed on the left-hand edge of the road. You know, somewhere probably down that bank. - What, so she was making it up? - Unless it was a left-hand drive car, in which case, out the passenger door, bang, middle of the road. - A big flash car, that's what she said. - Yeah, I suppose it's possible. - Can we trace left-hand drives through plates or something? - Well, they all have to be issued with special permits. (phone ringing) Bruford. - You're getting there, kiddo. - Yeah. - Jesus Christ. When was this? (birds chirping) (police radio chattering) Is that the guy who found her? - More accurately, his dog did. But it looks like pigs got there first. Forensics are gonna have a hard time with it. (Dave sighs) - Same forest. - As? - They dug up Leanne Sutcliffe about two k's north of here. - The man who killed her is still in prison, unless you know something I don't. - No. - Dave, I'm glad to have you on the team. Let's hope we can get a result on this as quickly and efficiently as we did last time. - Yeah. (sighs) - How many trees get used up in your average murder trial? - Have you got anything to drink? - Yeah, uh, gin no tonic? - Yeah, great. - So what exactly are we looking for? - Original statements from witnesses questioned in relation to Leanne's murder for starters. - Hmm. - [Both] Cheers. - Let's see if we can't pick any holes in it. - Well, how would we find anything the cops missed? - Everybody was so fixated on Dean, they didn't want to look at any alternatives. - Hey Joe, Sergeant Buford, please. Oh okay, could you put me through to his voicemail? - This is going to take forever. - Which is exactly why I've organized some help for us. He's experienced, he's on medical benefits, so he doesn't need the money, and he'll do just about anything for you. (Jodie sighs) - Hey Dave, just me. Uh, checking to see you're getting on with those left-hand drives. Give us a call, huh? Bye bye. - Tell me you're joking. (car engine rumbling) - Now, she's a lady, so you behave yourself. No staring at her boobs. (sniffing) Oh, woof! (dog whining) Sorry, Wolf gets a bit excited like his old man. (dog whining) (laughing) - Andy, you shouldn't have. - Fire sale. - No, no, I mean, I mean you really shouldn't have. Hey. - But sources confirm the body was that of a young woman found near a popular walking trail in the forest. Andrea Shaw, One News. (suspenseful music) (bright rock music) - Inspector is it now, Alan? It'll be commissioner next. - How can I help you? - I thought you might like to know. Trina Riley's going for another appeal. - And? - Well, it's who's helping you might be interested in. Johnny Lawless. - Oh god, how could anyone do that to another human being? - Some of the guys I meet, the miracle is it doesn't happen more often. - There's a cheery thought. (knocking) Oh, Andy! - Bad Wolf, naughty Wolf! (Wolf growls) - Miss Keane. (Jodie sighs) - Come on in. - Andy, long time, no see. - Sir. - I'll be brief. - You can do that, can you? - Neither you nor John, or this basket case, are licensed to carry out investigations on behalf of the others. You're not permitted to receive money for such services, and any information you obtain may contravene the privacy act. You are to cease any such investigations immediately or face prosecution. Any questions? - What's it to you? - What the hell are you doing here? - Well, if you'd answered your messages, maybe we could've met somewhere a bit less public. - Look, before you say a damn thing, yes, I am working the homicide. No, there's no connection to your Riley case, all right? Completely different MO, completely different everything. - Buy you a beer? (Dave sighs) (office workers chattering) How different were the bodies? - You are an asshole. Leanne was found in a shallow grave fully clothed. She was in the fetal position like she was sleeping, covered in a blanket. You know, Snow reckons he might've felt a bit of remorse and tried to make her feel better. That's after he tortured her, strangled her, and cut her ear off as a trophy. The latest girl, well, she was just tossed on the ground. Facedown, naked, no attempt made to hide her. - Any trophies taken? - Yeah, by pigs and dogs. But the pathologist reckons she might've been in some S&M thing, you know? She had buckle marks on her legs. They haven't identified her yet, but she might be a hooker and her client went to far. He panicked, dumped the body, end of story. - Who found the body? - When you left the force, this stopped being your business. - I didn't exactly have a choice, did I? - Cut the crap! The fact is you could've stayed and faced up, but you didn't want to. You know, you act as if Snow has ruined your life, the truth is, you didn't any help being a loser, you were doing a damn good job by yourself. - Fair enough. (Dave sighs) - Look, do you think getting Riley released is gonna make it all better? - Did they ever find the ear? - What? - The ear. It was mentioned in the autopsy, but not the trial report. - No, they found the damn ear. (suspenseful music) (energetic rock music) (women moaning) - We've been waiting for you. - I'm busy. - The lovable Inspector Snow came to see us today. - Yeah. - Apparently he was in charge of the Leanne Sutcliffe case. Apparently he's the one who put Dean away. That's why you came onboard, isn't it? Because you were hoping to have another go at Snow, and couldn't give a stuff if Dean's innocent or about me! Do you even know what it means to work with someone else? Screw you, Lawless! (men catcalling) - You'd look on me, love. (whistling) - Hey babe, what's the hurry? - Excuse me. - What would you say if I said I wanted to get in your pants? - Only room in there for one asshole. - You bitch! (energetic rock music) (Jodie screaming) - [Jodie] Let go! (grunting) - Let go or I'll break it! (screaming) - Get in! (energetic rock music) (suspenseful music) (dog barking) (John sniffs) - You okay? - Have I got a bald patch? - Not that you'd notice. - Okay, next time someone grabs you by the hair, put your hand on their hand and control them long enough so you can stick your other thumb in their eye. - And on that happy note, thank you and goodnight. - You know Dave shut me out? No access, no information, no investigation. - Was there anyone else? - No. My former comrades wouldn't piss on me if I was on fire. You know, Snow spread so much shit around when I left the force, some of it eventually stuck. So they knocked back my application for a license, no firm would touch me. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. I'd like to invite you in for a drink, but there's probably a really good reason why I shouldn't. You know, I just can't think of it. - You wanna see my list? - I bet. (laughs) - Look, I've got an old friend in motor vehicles. Maybe she'll flick us some names and addresses of left-hand drive owners. Seeing as Dave's not being much help. - Great. (Jodie laughs) - You definitely don't need another drink. - I guess not. (laughs) (soft instrumental music) - Goodnight, drink lots of water. (John laughs) (engine revving) - The victim has been identified as 22 year old Helen McIntyre, here on vacation. A local man, Gary Sutherland found the body while out bush walking with his dog. This is Andrea Shore, One News. - Bush walkin'? Sure you were, Gary. - Police are refusing to comment on suggestions that there may be a link to the murder of Leanne Sutcliffe, whose naked mutilated body was found in the same forest over five years ago. The man convicted of her murder, Dean Riley, has always maintained his innocence. - My heart goes out to the family and friends of this latest victim. Well, it's time the police admit that they got it wrong. The real killer is still out there somewhere, while my husband's inside for something that he didn't do. - Go on, come on. Come on, inside. Come on. (car engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) - Not now, Roachy. (energetic funky music) Keep up, mate. (car engines revving) (John laughs) (John laughs) (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) (light guitar music) (birds chirping) (smacks lips) Gary? (Gary sighs) - Shit, Johnny. - This is special. - I heard you was a narc. Rasta, sic him. Sic him! - Hey fella, how are you? Ooh, Moosey, don't kill me. - Shit! - Gary! (groans) (energetic funky music) Gary! Gary, I swear to God, I'll shoot your ass! - Oh shit! (shouts) (explosion rumbles) (sighs) How 'bout we go halves? Come on, man. I sweated blood over this crop, dude. - I don't want your dope, Gary. I want you to show me where you really found that body. (breathing heavily) - I was sittin' back there, just you know, trying to have a peaceful sleep and that. Rasta's barking his head off. (barking) By the time I had a look, uh, Rasta had half dug her up. I freaked, man. I wrapped her up in a couple of garbage bags, carried her over to the other side of the ridge. I couldn't have the cops crawling around here, man. Three weeks and this will all be wet, sticky and ready to harvest. - So, why'd you top 'em off? - I waited a few days, then it started to get to me, you know? Spooky. - Was she covered in anything when you found her? - Yeah, it was a blanket or a sheet or something, I don't know. I burned it, just in case the cops traced it to me somehow. - Good thinking, Einstein. - Three weeks, man. It's all I need. - You got three hours, then the cops are crawling all over here. Just cut your losses, geezer. - Shit! (car engine revving) (knocking) - You're working for Snow? - Huh? - You tell Snow if I found out he set Riley up, I'll prove it, all right? Cheers. (suspenseful music) (bluesy rock music) - Police have confirmed that the body was moved at least two days prior to the discovery. Police were tipped off to the original burial site, and found evidence of a recently harvested marijuana plantation. - Good orders. - Thank you! - Any action there yet? - No. - At least I'm still in with a chance then, huh? - Keep dreaming, man. (slow bluesy music) So no promises, but we've got a pretty good lead there going on with the cars. - Oh thanks, I'm really glad you're on the case. - My pleasure. - Hey, see you later, Jodie. - See you later. Hey, that was an amazing bit of detective work finding that grave. - Stroke of luck actually. - No, we make our own luck, don't we? The funny thing is when I tried to be a cop, they told me I was psychologically unsuited. I think they were right. - Absolutely. You're too funny, you're too smart. - Mm, too pigheaded. So, what now? - Well, we've gotta find the guy that did it. You know, get some closure. - Oh no, you're better off on your own. I haven't exactly achieved anything of note so far. - I thought I was the only one who was allowed to feel sorry for themselves? - Well, it's true, isn't it? - Look, 99% of detective work is just plain hard slog. All the stuff you and Andy are doing, finding left-hand drives, that's the sort of thing that's gonna pay off. - You think so? - Oh yeah, I know it. So how have you been getting on cross-matching witness reports? - Say what? - Of course I thought of it, it's obvious, but it's Jodie's show and I respect that. (keyboard clicking) We got it! - Right again. - Hey. - Graham Newby. Veterinary surgeon, owner of a '60 Caddy, pale green. He was interviewed at the time because he had access to the stables where Dean was working and the horse blanket Leanne was wrapped in came from there. (birds chirping) (knocking) - Hi there. - Oh, I'll be right with you. There you go, just like that. - That you, Mr. Newby. - Oh, that's all right. You got it? Do you know what he calls that rabbit? Puss! Ha, I'm not kidding. - Whatever happened to Bugs and Cottontail, huh? - Exactly. Uh, so what can I do for you? - Johnny Lawson. - Graham Newby. - Look, I'm not sure. Um, a friend of mine said someone out this way has got a Chevy, early '60s original left-hand drive. - Actually, it's a Cadillac. A 1960 Cadillac. - Cool. - Everyone's saying it's gotta be more than a coincidence. Well, a woman from the Weekly Times wants to interview me even. - That sounds good, honey. - Jodie and John have been great. They're really supportive. - I've been making a dollhouse for Gemma's birthday. - Oh, she'll love it. - I'm starting to get worried she might be getting too old for it. - She still plays with her dolls. - That's good. - I'll give it to you next time you come to visit me. - Well, you might not have to. You might be able to give it to her yourself. - You think so? - Oh god, I really hope so, Dean. Well, things have gotta start going our way. I mean, they've just got to. - I know. (light instrumental music) - Oh man, phew. Well, what can I say? She's beautiful. - Yep, but definitely not for sale. (chuckles) - You're not even interested in hearing my offer? - Nope, no way. - You must be immunizing a lot of rabbits, huh? (Graham chuckles) - My father had one identical, so I guess you could say it's a sentimental thing. - You know where I could find your father's? I don't mean the sound nosy or anything. I thought I might be able to track it down. - He left 20 years ago. The Caddy was the only thing my mother let him take. - At least he had his priorities right. (laughing) - Absolutely! - Do you mind? - Please. - Are these the original miles? She's barely run in then. - Oh, I use the old pickup for running around town. This baby only comes out on special occasions. - Oh well, I'll keep looking, huh? Thanks very much, cheers. - Lucky guess if this was the first place you stopped at. - Oh, the guy up the road pointed me this way. - Nigel, up at the stables? - I didn't catch his name. See ya later. - Yeah. - And we can assure the public that considerable resources have been allocated towards this case. - Inspector, inspector? - Detective... - [Reporter] Do you have any definite leads? - [Alan] We're pursuing several promising lines of inquiry. - [Reporter] Do the police have any different suspects? - I don't think it would benefit the investigation to answer that at this stage. - [Reporter] Would you like to comment on the report that a private investigator found the body before the police? - A private citizen called in with useful information, that's by no means unusual. - [Reporter] Inspector, will you be reopening the Leanne Sutcliffe case in the light of this recent murder? - It's unlikely. After thorough consideration, it's our opinion that any connection with that earlier case is either coincidental or possibly a copycat scenario. The murderer of Leanne Sutcliffe is already behind bars, where he will shortly be joined by this latest killer. Thank you. (dramatic music) (power tools whirring) (breathing heavily) - How's it going? - Got a whole lot busier since you stuck your oar in. - You heard Dean Riley's in hospital? - Yeah, well, you get that when you chop your fingers off. - Well, I'm guessing he had his mind on other things. - Yeah, or he's clumsy. You want any coffee? - But first some information. - What is it with you? Why can't you just leave it alone? You know, I've gotta work with Snow. I don't need this aggravation. - Well, it's just one thing. - After another, after another. Look, sorry, I just, this case is getting to me. You know what it's like. - Yeah, yeah. The autopsy report on this latest girl, did it say what killed her? - Well, there was a fair quantity of Nozinan in her system, plus alcohol, that'll keep you pretty quiet. But no, I don't know what killed her. Her body was a real mess. - Stomach contents? - Look, there are 50 cops working on this job. What makes you think you'll make any difference? - Just humor me. - Her stomach was empty. - Just like Leanne? It could be the same guy. - Look, there's no connection. - Cheers, Dave. (birds chirping) (Dave sighs) (dogs barking) - So how do you get hold of this Nozzy, whatchamacallit? - Nozinan. - Is it recreational? - It's a sedative. - So he slipped her a Mickey Finn? - Maybe, but vets also call it methotrimeprazine. - It wasn't really mentioned in Leanne's autopsy report. - Yeah, well, she wasn't found for a few weeks, and it breaks down really quickly in the body. As for the buckle marks on the legs, Dave said they were looking at the dominatrix angle, but I don't know. Um, straps or hobbles or something? - As in horses. What was he doing? Saddling them up and riding them? - Oh, please. - Hang on, Leanne had saddle soap in her mouth. Maybe she was gagged with like, a leather strap? We've got a real suspect here, haven't we? (suspenseful music) (car engine rumbling) (birds chirping) So, we just watch him? - For now. - But you have got a plan, right? - Not yet. - Would you tell us if you had? - We're a team, right? - Its his MO that worries me. - His MO? You've been reading again. - Why the gap? Why five years between murders? - I don't know, maybe it's just a murder of opportunity. - Well, you don't have to wait five years to find a girl who's hitchhiking. - [John] True. - Yeah, she's got you there, John Boy. (laughs) - Look, I'm gonna go grab some sleep. I'll relieve you guys at about twenty hundred. (birds chirping) (heavy metal music) (camera shutter clicking) - Come on, let's go. (suspenseful music) Gone with the Wind, Jaws, Grease, Taxi Driver? - That's a classic. Robert De Niro at his best. (suspenseful music) - What do you think this is? - Ugly. - Oh god, you don't think? It's someone's ashes. (tape ripping) (suspenseful music) (recorder beeps) Hello Sally, it's his mom in there. (heavy metal music) (phone ringing) - Yeah, Lawless? - The police were just here. Dean's escaped from hospital. Gemma's staying at my parents'. She saw Dean in the garage. He's taken Dad's rifle. (suspenseful music) (car engine revving) (Jodie sighs) - Okay, here we go. - Oh, John Boy's not gonna like this. Any evidence we get won't be admissible. - Then we just won't tell anyone, will we? (laughing) (suspenseful music) - [Graham] Yeah, hello, it's Graham Newby here. - Yeah, sweet ass. - [Graham] It's about this invoice for the rental. The vet, yeah, I'm gonna need... - Have you seen those reality shows where they stick those minicams all over the place? Bullshit. - Fascinating. - They're okay for close urban surveillance, but they're as expensive as hell. - Come on, Andy, let's go! - Where? - To find out about Sally. (suspenseful music) (lively classical music) - Hello, detective. (suspenseful music) (Dean groaning) - How are you, Dean? - Whoa. Trina's real worried about you. - Yeah? (panting) Well, she ain't gonna have to worry much longer. You were right, it's that prick in there. This is all his fault! - Listen, you kill Snow, who's gonna care really? - I am. - Look, we've got a real strong lead, a guy who might've killed both of them. - That's crap! - But how do you know? You ask Trina, she'll tell you it's true. (suspenseful music) (lively classical music) - It's too damn hard. Getting my hopes up one second and getting crammed back down that hole the next. - Just give us the gun. We can get the hell outta here. - No way! - No! (gunshot fires) (dramatic music) (glass shatters) (Dean groans) (suspenseful music) Oh shit. Damn it! Hang in there, John. Ambulance. - I'm so sad that I'm missing Auntie Sally. You know, I promised Mom that I'd keep in touch, but I just kept putting it off and putting it off. - Well, everyone has such busy lives these days. - Was she lonely? - No, her Graham used to visit every week. You know Graham, don't you? - Yes, he's the vet. - Lovely man. He'd go into a room and we'd hear him telling her all the stories of his week. - So, she was quite with it then? - Well, she had her mental faculties, but she was almost totally incapacitated. Well, you did know she'd had a stroke? Quite a severe one. She'd lost the power of speech and she couldn't walk or feed herself. - Yes, yes, of course. That was, that was quite some time ago, wasn't it? - About five years ago. - It must've been the year I was down in the South Island. That was September, right? - Yes, that's right. - Graham was reluctant to place Sally with us, of course it was too much for him on his own eventually. - Well, thank you so much for the talk. - How's my big Wolf then? Who's my... What do we know? - Graham loved his dear old mom to bits. (Wolf whines) - Yeah? He must be a murderer then. Hey, Wolfie? - Bullet wound, right upper chest. There'll be loss of blood and saline drip en route. BP 85/50. Pulse 120. He's still conscious. - Guess what? He went after the crazy girl the same day his mother was cremated. What? What's up? (suspenseful music) (machines beeping) - He's out of theater. They won't even let me see him. (Wolf whining) - Well, then I can hang round. - People to see. - [Both] Hi. - Is John all right? - He was operated on, but he's gonna be okay. - Look, I'm really sorry. - It's not your fault, Trina. How's Dean? - He'll probably lose his fingers now, the idiot. (laughs) I could kill him. Just, after all we've been through. How the hell could he just throw it away like that? - I don't know. Look, I'll see you later, okay? - Okay. - Oh shit. - I thought I'd pop in and thank you for saving my life. - Accidents do happen. - Why'd you stop him, John? I know you hate me. - Not as much I thought, apparently. - Have you got any idea why he came gunning for me in particular? - Because you ruined his life. - You think I set him up? John, that's not true. If there was any tampering here, it wasn't mine. Dave tells me you've been having a hard time of it lately. It might seem a little late, but, uh, I want to say I'm sorry. I'd like to think we could put the past behind us. (suspenseful music) (John groans) - Hi there. - Hi. - I'll sit up. - Oh. (John groans) Ooh, I'm sorry. - It's all right. (John groans) - Are you all right? - Missed anything vital? Just tell me, that's me. - See what happens when I let you go off on your own? If you had to take a bullet, why did it have to be for Snow? - I wish I knew. (Jodie laughs) - Anyway, let me give you a progress report. - Yeah, good. - Two weeks before Leanne was killed, our suspect's mother suffered a serious stroke, then just before the latest murder, she died. Well? - It's good. - I mean, the trauma from his mother could be like a trigger, you know? Like a grief thing, I've read about a similar case. - Do you know what? Can we talk about this later? - What is it, do you want me to get a nurse? - No, I haven't got what I need. - What's that? - Vodka, whiskey, pills. - It's a problem? - Only when I can't get it. You should both lay low for a bit. I'll be out of here in a few days max. - Well, what do I do? What if he strikes again? - If he is the guy. - What do you mean if? What about the car? - It's been five years. There's no connection with Leanne. - All he needs is another inciting incident. - Have you been reading those books? - Don't you dare put me down like that. - I'm sorry. I just think we should back off and let the cops do their thing, you know? - Well, surely you don't trust Snow? - Well, I'm not so sure that Snow did set Riley up. - And how can you think that? - Because he told me. - Oh, I see. Oh, so it's all over for you then? Why because you and Snow kissed and made up? Well, I guess I'll just have to do it on my own then. (Jodie sighs) (birds chirping) Andy, move that arm or lose it. - Sorry, sorry. - Next time you will be. Ugh. - Three days sleeping next to a goddess and no action. You want to see something blue? - You want me to cut them off? Is there any coffee left? Andy, he's got a visitor! - Are you sure this is the most recent? - It would seem so. It's made before she had a stroke. - [Graham] She always used to joke she was gonna leave everything to the Pony Club. - Horse lover was she? - Oh, and then some. - [Lawyer] Well, it looks like the horses lose out. She's left you everything. Deed to the house, blue ribbon stocks. - [Graham] I, I don't understand. (recorder beeps) - What's happening? - Flat battery. - Oh! - I told you it was only good for a few days. - Oh man, technology! - Hey wait, where are you going? (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) (Graham sighs) - Almost worth getting shot for, eh? (laughing) - Sir? I was just, um, visiting a friend. - It's all right, Dave. And there was something I wanted to ask you. I'm not asking you to betray him, I just want to know, why the hell does he think I set up Dean Riley? I ran that case by the book. - You did, sir. - Close the door. (Dave sighs) - It's the job sheet from the Leanne Sutcliffe investigation. - I can see that. I kept it from the defense. I never wrote it up. - Why did you do that? - I thought they might leap on it, you know? Use it to muddy the waters, and it was only a vague lead. - Does anyone else know? - No. - Riley killed her. You know that and so do I. This information doesn't change that fact one iota. Does it? Think long and hard about this, Dave. Unless you think it's really important, it's not worth rocking the boat. (Dave sighs) - I don't get it. The lawyer says his mother left him everything. - I'd be nice to someone's ashes if they're dead, and I'm meant to be crazy. - Exactly, it should've set him off then. What on earth is he doing? - Hot date? (upbeat saxophone music) - Stands out in a crowd, ain't it? (slow bluesy music) - This was not the plan. We should have three cars tailing at least. - Yeah, well, we don't. - He'll make us! - He's cruising for a hitchhiker, he must be! - [Andy] We could be following him for days, weeks. - You want to call it quits right now? - Oh shit. - Down, down! (Jodie sighs) - Why don't we get a decent night's sleep and call John Boy? - He can't help us, Andy. You saw Graham, he's gonna do something. - Well, maybe this is how he gets his kicks, dressing up and cruising, it doesn't mean he's killed anyone. It just means he's mad, who isn't? - Look. - [Andy] You want to give her a ride? - What's the bet he comes back? (energetic rock music) - It's all right. - I'm sorry I haven't been in earlier. - That's cool. - Yeah, I'm flat out with this homicide, you know? And (clears throat) actually, I've been feeling like a bit of a prick. - Don't worry about it, man. Ow! So, are you close to cracking it or what? - Well, I heard Snow on the tube saying we're following several promising leads. I wish he'd tell me what they are. (John chuckles) Look, how's it going? You know, tracking down those left-hand drivers? - Oh, Jodie was looking into it. - Bright girl. - Yeah, she is. - Has anyone come up with a Dodge or a Caddy, pale green or cream? - Why is that? - Well, it's just I was doing some followup interviews, and this old guy seemed to remember a big Caddy, you know, pale green or cream, about the same area as Riley dropped off Leanne. - Hiya. - Hi. - Can I get a lift? - Yeah, jump in. - Cheers. - What, Dave? - Look, he was an old codger. He was vague about the time. I knew it would just confuse the jury. I didn't want that bastard Riley to get off. (suspenseful music) What? - So, I just thought, what the hell, you know? Just meet up with my girlfriend in Queenstown, until she gets over her stupid infatuation. (Graham chuckles) - Are you booked in anywhere tonight? - No, no, I just thought I'd keep my eye out for one of those cute little B&Bs. Have you got any suggestions? - Um, this time of night, you're probably better off with a motel. - Well, you're the local. - Women, give them an inch, they take your gonads. (phone ringing) Shit! Yo? - Yeah Andy, is Jodie there? - Uh, not right now, no. - Listen, tell her there's a definite connection between the vet and Leanna Sutcliffe, all right? So, don't do anything stupid, just hang back. - Okay. - You stay put, I'll be over there in a sec. - We're not there. - Andy, Andy? - Really, you don't look like a vet. - No? (chuckles) - No. - What do I look like? - Hmm, I don't know. Maybe a little bit like Robert De Niro. What was that movie that he was in and he was a Taxi Driver? - Taxi Driver. - Yeah, well, he played a taxi driver. (laughing) - No, it was called Taxi Driver. - Oh! (laughs) I sound like such a blonde. That was such a fab movie though, wasn't it? - Yeah, actually it's one of my favorites. - I thought we were going straight ahead up here? - This is a shortcut. So, you're pretty brave hitchhiking alone. - Well, I guess I like taking risks. - [Graham] Yeah? (laughs nervously) - Anyway, I struck it lucky. I trust anyone who takes care of animals. - Maybe, um, maybe tomorrow you should take a bus. - Sure. - Here we go, here we go. - What's that idiot up to? - I have no idea. (suspenseful music) - Tell Cheryl to quit playing games and get out here. - What? - My girlfriend. You picked her up hitching just outside of the service station while I was getting the van filled. (suspenseful music) Cheryl, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I like your mom, I really do. - Do you know him? You said you were a tourist. - I'm sorry, my boyfriend and I had a fight, and I told him to leave me alone, but he just can't take a hint. - Come on, Cheryl. Let's not take up anymore of this guy's time. She's a bit of a firecracker, buddy. (Jodie sighs) It's him. - Are you all right? - Yeah, no, yeah, I'll be fine. Matt and I, we'll sort things out. But thanks a lot for the lift. Hey, hang on! You forgot your bag. - Thanks a lot, cheers. - [Two-Way Radio] Andy, Andy, where are you? Andy come in! - Is that for you? - No, Andy the guy I borrowed the van off. (Wolf barking) - Ooh, careful little one. Here you go. - Yeah. (Wolf barking) (dramatic music) (Jodie yelling) - Get off him! No! Andy, no! No, no! Please, get off! (screaming) (grunting) (Jodie sobbing) Damn it! No! (Graham yells) - Oh, bitch! - No, no, no! - Bitch! (Jodie screaming) - No, no! (breathing heavily) (sirens wailing) (police radio chattering) - Andy! Christ, mate. Andy, where's Jodie, mate? - [Paramedic] One, two, three. - Andy, what happened to Jodie? - Hang in there. - John, I should've told you before. Yeah, I knew I was doing wrong even back then, but it just seemed necessary. - Listen, if you want to preach, find a church. - Sorry, sir, you can't... - Tell him. - All right, take that. - Okay, why'd he leave his car? - Well, maybe he thought it was less conspicuous than the van. - No, it doesn't work that way. - The car's part of his trip. He loves the thing fanatically. There's some scratches on the ignition. (van engine rumbling) (birds chirping) (chain rattling) (John sighs) - [John] Dave. - Yeah, all right, come on. (sirens wailing) (body thumping) - Forensics are gonna be really pissed off. - Oh shit, okay, wait. One for the garage, one for the other car, uh, padlock, and this one looks like a house key, but it doesn't fit anything. - Does he work from home? - No, no, he wouldn't bring the girls here. It's too close to the neighbors. - What about taking them straight out to the forest. - Okay, uh, he keeps them away for a day maybe two. They both had empty stomachs. We know for a fact Leanne had dinner the night she went missing. There's a phone number on this one. - Hey, give it here, I'll call it in. - We're gonna have to cut some corners with this one, Dave. You call out the AOS, Special Forces, every man you can find. (dramatic music) (siren wailing) - [Recorded Message] This is Te Manawa Realty. We can't take your call right now. Please leave a message, thank you. (sirens wailing) (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (panting) - Please let me go. Help! Somebody help me! (whimpering) - Shh, shh, or you will die. Right now just like this, is that clear? Is that clear? (whimpering) You are to speak when you're spoken to. You don't make a sound without permission. Here are the rules, okay? I asked you a question! - Okay. (suspenseful music) - Good. (whimpering) (siren pulsing) (knocking) - Hello? - Desperate to buy or desperate to sell? - Listen, do you know where I can find the boss, do you? He's not answering the after hours phone. It's real important. - Oh, knowing Kevin, he's probably got his hands full. (knocking) - Go away! (shouting) - Shut up! Are you Kevin? - Yeah. - It's the second track up the hill after the old church. No, it's the third. We actually manage quite a few houses in that area. - Yeah, all right, then what? - Are you a friend of Graham's, Mister, uh? Okay, uh, then you go just straight on until you get to the Wilson's barn. You can't miss it on the right, no, no, it's on the left. No, I mean, it's on the right as you're going there. - For Christ's sake! - Well, it's no good yelling at me. The area is very isolated. I haven't actually been out there for quite awhile. - Okay. - [Police Radio] Roger 37. Officers have been dispatched to the area. Do you require any further backup? Over. - [Graham] You were watching me, why? - They'll be onto you by now. - I asked you a question! - Please don't shout at me. (Graham sighs) (wind howling) - I like you. If your boyfriend hadn't interfered, I wouldn't have even touched you. - He's not my boyfriend. - Hey! I was talking. Say sorry. - I'm sorry. (whimpering) - Say worry again. - I'm sorry. (Graham laughs) - Yeah, I love this shit. You know why I love animals so much? Because they listen. They do what they're told, they wait for instructions, and they listen. - I can do that. I can listen if you want. - Can you? Well, I'd like that. I'd like that a lot. (suspenseful music) Good girl. (siren wailing) (energetic dramatic music) - Dave, you there, Dave? - Yeah John, I'm here. - Is your side organized? - John, it's Alan here. What do you got? - He's out on the peninsula somewhere. It's a big area to cover but, oh Christ. - John, do you read me? - He's got Andy's radio, get off the air! - John, what's your position? Stay back, don't endanger the girl. - Sounds like we'd better get on with it, huh? - Can I ask you a question? Why do you want to hurt me? - [Graham] Who said I wanted to hurt you? - Then why are you doing... - Hey! I said one question. All right then, go on, ask me another question. (sighs) Ask me about my day. - Will you please tell me about your day? - Well, (sighs) I thought a lot about my mom. She, um, she died recently. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, well, I coped in my own way. When I finally thought I'd gotten rid of her and everything, she left me everything in her will. (laughs) - She must've really cared about you. - She said that I was a boring little boy who grew up to be a boring little man. She used to talk, and talk, and talk, and talk, and talk all the time. She'd never, ever listen. I used to think I could just get up and walk away, but I couldn't. I'd just sit there listening to her pulling me apart, tearing me to pieces. - You used to speak to her a lot, didn't you? After the stroke? - Yeah, poor Mom. She couldn't do anything. She couldn't move. She just had to sit there and listen to everything I said, every last word. (laughs) Do you wanna know what I talked about? The first girl I ever picked up, I only raped her. You know she didn't even report it? (laughs) Like it wasn't even important. - Maybe she was too ashamed. - Or maybe she'd had so many men, one more didn't matter. Anyway, I made sure the next time I had plenty of details, newspaper cuttings, lots of special things to tell Mom. I knew she'd believe me then. She couldn't talk but, she could cry. (laughs) I used to take her gifts, special presents to show her how bad I'd been. What shall I give her of you? - She's dead, she can't hear you. - Shh. Maybe I could keep you a secret from her. Would you like that? (laughs) (sighs) I could talk to you forever. I could love you. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (sniffing) You smell sweet, like a kitten. (laughs) - Can we get more comfortable? - I'm fine. - It's just that my legs are going to sleep. - Do you want me to untie you? So you can throw your arms and legs around me? (suspenseful music) Would you screw me if you thought I wasn't gonna kill you? I asked you a question. - No, I'd make love with you. - You don't love me! - I could learn to. - Bullshit! You'd just screw me until the cavalry arrives. - I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that. - Be quiet! Animals know love. People are too selfish. (dramatic music) - What's that? - Sodium pentobarbital. If you'd hear the excuses people have killing their pets. We're going overseas. She's getting old, barks too much. When I put an animal down, they just lay there peacefully, while the light slowly goes out of their eyes. - You don't have to do this. I thought that, um... - What, I was gonna let you go? (laughs) - I thought you liked me. You, you like me, don't you? - Yeah, I do like you. That's why I'm just gonna put you to sleep. Oh, it won't hurt. I promise you that right now, and I might play with you afterwards. There'll be nothing to tell Mom. (dramatic music) - Please, please don't do this. - I have to. - Don't you want to talk some more? - Have you ever had one of those experiences where you spill your guts to a total stranger and it feels really, really good at the time, but afterwards, frankly, it's just a little bit embarrassing? Bitch! (groans) (energetic music) (Jodie grunting) (yelling) (screaming) - No! - Stay back! Get down, get down on the floor. - Okay. - Get down right now! - I'm going, man. But just let her go. - Just leave us alone! - Let's just talk about it, eh? - What the hell for? - Jodie. - Your mother was right, you are boring. - Shut up. - It's what I thought, you're a twisted little prick. You're pathetic! - You bitch! - Yeah, we're all bitches. You killed those women because you're an evil piece of garbage! You killed those women because you're stronger and meaner! So don't blame anyone else! (Graham screams) (Jodie yells) - Come on, mate. Give it up. (breathing heavily) - Should we do something? - I don't think we can. (Jodie sobbing) - Is Andy okay? - Yeah, he's alive. Hey, hello, Dave. - Look, I sent a copy of that missing job sheet through to Trina's lawyers. With any luck, Dean can trade the time he's already done against giving you a bullet. - Good career move, man. - Sergeant? - Yeah, yeah. Look, you two take it easy, eh? - Later, man. Good as a bought one, cheers, man. - Have you seen a doctor about that? - No. (Jodie sobbing) - Jesus, I'm sorry. - No, no, no, it's all right, come on. - Oh god, I feel like an alien's taken over my body, as bad as you are. - Do you want me to take you home? No, I'm sorry. - No, no, no, it's not you. It's not you. - I know. You got a long, long list, right? - I just, um, I just want to go home and have a long hot bath. - All right. - Besides, if we're gonna be working together. - Are we? - Aren't we? - John? You just can't do it by the book, can you? - Guess not. (smooth jazzy music)
