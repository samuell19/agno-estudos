Xiao Laoyao, where are you going? Bring the food in. I'm starving. What are you doing? Yongqiang, Xiao Laoyao went down. Hey. Hey. Is everything all right? Oh, my. Do you want to die? Who are you? Why are you chasing me? I... I'm not a robber. Don't come over. I'd rather die than go to jail again. Don't. [Evil Hunter] Thank you. You're welcome. Don't move. Give me your bag. Robbery! Let go! Let go! Ah! Qiang, are you all right? Wang, go after him. Hello, this is 110 of Yuzhou. Hello, officer. Our money was robbed. [Public Security] Drive faster! Did you see the suspect's face and physical features clearly? No. They wore helmets. My father said the money was for my marriage. He hit my car. Officer, I was driving my car following the traffic rules. Suddenly a motorcycle broke my car. Can you speak Mandarin? I'm speaking Mandarin. My car was broken. What do I do now? Did you see what he looked like? I don't know who you're talking about. He was wearing a helmet. I couldn't see him. Did you see where they went? I saw two people. One went this way, and the other went this way. What about my car? My car was broken. Pay us. Do you have money or not? Let me ask you. I work day and night every day. It's not easy to make money, boss. If you don't give me the money, my wife will divorce me. Pay us. Pay us. I didn't lie to you. It was really robbed. What do I do? It's not our fault. You should still pay us. Pay us! Stop arguing. I'm Han Bing, the deputy captain of the Criminal Investigation Unit. Your salary was indeed robbed. It's none of my business. Listen. I promise I'll pay you the salary. Since Mr. Zhou said so, please believe him. Okay. Stop making a scene. The officer has made it clear. Let's go home and work. Take a holiday. Let's go have a look. Remember to come back. The government said it will protect our property. Robbery in broad daylight? You… You can't say that. What should I say? Should I tell the government leaders that you did nothing? Mr. Zhou, you have the right to report the situation to any supervisor. But let me tell you, we didn't neglect our duty. We will solve the case as soon as possible. Let's go. This is the footage from the surveillance camera. It's a remote view. It's all blurry when zoomed in. And the suspect was wearing a helmet. We couldn't see his face clearly. The crime scene was under a temporary traffic light. No surveillance camera was installed. Talk about what you know. The suspect was wearing a helmet. We couldn't see his face. So we can't get a simulated portrait. According to the investigation done by the physical evidence section and the trace section, there was no valuable clue at the scene. He was wearing gloves. According to the accountant and the driver, the window was locked because they were carrying a lot of money. The suspect broke the glass with a gun and committed the robbery. How dare a criminal rob in broad daylight? It was a bold move. It was also a blatant provocation to us. And Tiancheng is an influential company in the city. Mr. Qin, Secretary to the Mayor, called and said that the mayor is very concerned about this. He urged us to solve the case as soon as possible to avoid more social impact. Understood. Okay. We'll split into four teams. Team 1, led by me, will be responsible for the key investigation. The driver, the accountant and Zhou Jialing... Suddenly, a motorcycle stopped by my side. I really don't remember. You didn't see the facial features of the suspect? Team 2, led by Sima, will investigate all the hotels under our jurisdiction. Team 3, led by Luo Yongqiang and Qian Longsheng, will keep investigating on the motorcycle. [Buy and sell used cars, fully licensed] Who asks the name of the person who comes to buy a used car? Then local... I really don't know. Team 4, led by Zhao Meijuan, will focus on investigating suspicious persons around the crime scene. Xiao Laoyao, slow down. Where are you going? I'm not talking about you. Get up. I've told you many times to turn off your phone when you sleep. Can't you hear me? Okay. Laoyao, what's on your body? Hello? Give me back my phone. I'll double the pay. No way. You want me to go to jail for the third time? Name your price. Sure. Give me 300,000. Okay. Midnight snack's here. Amazing. Yay! Here. Longsheng, here. Thank you. Thank you, Bing. Ms. Han, one is not enough for me. I know. I've prepared one more for you. Give me the money for two portions. Yongqiang, here. Bing, I'd better not eat. What are you doing? I want to sleep. Women age faster when they don't get enough sleep. If you want to sleep, go home and sleep for three days and three nights. You don't need to eat, drink or even go to the toilet. Qiang may not talk much, but he always talks to the point. By the way, let's talk while eating. Any feedback? Motorbike helmets are everywhere. It's meaningless. I found the original owner of the motorcycle. But he sold it six months ago. It's not easy to find the current owner. Through our visits to hotels and hostels, no suspicious person was found. Same here. I asked the accountant and the driver. There was nothing suspicious. Oh, right. There's new news from the Trace Department. We suspect that the motorcycle used to be a taxi. What is special is the sound system on the motorcycle. Yongqiang and Longsheng will team up tomorrow and keep looking for the current owner of the motorcycle. Meijuan and I will visit Zhou Jialin. Okay. So You suspect me? We just want to see your company's financial report for the past six months. Your company... I run a big company. I'm a major taxpayer. The government also supports us. Let me tell you. Even if there is a little flaw, I have the final say. Let me tell you. Before the case is closed, the police have the right to suspect anyone. We're going to investigate everyone involved in this case, no matter who it is. Please cooperate. Boss. Yes? Do you recognize this motorcycle? This bastard crashed the motorcycle again. It's Xiao Laoyao's. Are you sure? It must be Xiao Laoyao's. I installed the speaker for him. I installed it twice. I just installed it. I'm not bragging. The motorcycle crashed so badly. Our speaker is still intact. Look how great my speaker is. Call me if you want to install a speaker. No problem. I'll give you a discount. Well. Who are you? Yongqiang, what's new? There was no clue at the repair shop, so we investigated the speaker. It was unexpected that there was only one agent of that brand in the city. The owner of this speaker shop said he just modified the speaker last week and he knew the owner Xiao Laoyao. Longsheng, the owner is Xiao Laoyao? Yes. Hey, Xiao Laoyao. Slow down. Do you know him? I've seen him in the general market. If the one the owner talked about is the same person I met, why would he wear a red helmet, ride a blue motorcycle, and be very agile? Captain Han, based on the clues we have now, we can confirm that Xiao Laoyao is one of the suspects. Bring Xiao Laoyao back to the unit tomorrow for questioning. Got it. We lost him. I can't get through. Got it. That won't be a problem. [Mr. Guo] [Chengguan Kindergarten Green Island Campus] Feng. Yes. Here. Come on. How was today? Did you behave well? 300,000! 300,000! Almost there. 300,000. Who is it? Water and electricity fees collection. Coming. Hello, Chubby. Okay. I'll be right there. Okay. Oh no, my phone was stolen. [Foot Massage] Xiao Laoyao, what are you waiting for? Take the food in. What are you doing? Yongqiang, Xiao Laoyao went down. Meijuan, stay here. The rest of you go after him with me! Do you want to die? Who are you? Why are you chasing me? Don't move. Get up. Who dares to touch my man? - I'll kill him! - Chubby. Don't you worry about me. I'm fine. I'll be back in a few days. Go home. Hello. Dad. Pack your things and wait for me at home with Junfeng. I'll be right back to pick you up. What happened? I can't go out now. Dad. Never mind all that. Pack your things. I'll talk to you face to face. Hello? Feng, let's go. Come on. Officer, I really don't know who he is. He always calls me. I've never seen him. Hello. Are you the Xiao Laoyao? Who are you? It doesn't matter who I am. I want to rent your motorcycle. Two thousand yuan for half a day. Are you crazy? Go see a doctor. - 2,000 yuan. - Open your milk box. That's the deposit. He called me that afternoon. Turn off the music. What? Turn off the music. Don't you feel high? Turn it off. Where do you want to go? What are you doing here? To collect debts. Debt? Follow that car. Don't move! Give me your bag. - Robbery! - Stop! If you run away, I'll shoot you! Go! Faster! Sir. If I knew he was committing robbery, I wouldn't have done it. Why didn't you call the police after the incident? I... Fine. Give me 300,000 yuan. Where's the motorcycle? What happened? I was afraid people might find out, so I bought a similar one to cover it up. Sir, I really... I've told you everything I know. Back so soon? Dad. Junfeng! Junfeng! Son! Son! Junfeng. Son. Wan Xiaowen. You decided to call me now? Guo Meilian. Why did you kill my dad? Where is my son? You're the one who didn't keep your word. I beg you. Please don't hurt my son. I beg you. Tomorrow at 9 a.m., bring the money and come to the roof of Wenyuan Building to exchange your son. If you dare to call the police, just wait to collect the body. After the investigation, there are no signs of fighting in the room. The door and windows are intact. There are scratches on the platform. It matches the location where the victim fell down. We extracted five people's footprints from the room. They belong to three men, one woman, and a child. The footprints of the males included the deceased's. As for who the other two men and one woman are and where the child is, we don't know yet. The victim fell from the eighth floor to the top of a car. The fall caused intracranial and thoracic bleeding. That's an important reason for his death. There's no sign of pulling or foreign object in his hands. He landed on his back on the roof of the car. Hello? I'll be back late today. I have to get the money with the accountant at 3 p.m. and pay the migrant workers. Okay, Dad. Okay. - [Calling through encrypted VolP] - [Xiao Laoyao] Did you get in touch with his son? No, I couldn't get through. Keep trying. Got it. As the person involved in the robbery, at this critical moment, whether he committed suicide or was killed, I think the two cases should be investigated together. The call is connected. Guo Meilian, I told you. I'll give you all the money I took. How's my son doing? Let me talk to my son. Hello? Guo Meilian. Guo Meilian. Arrest Wan Xiaowen immediately. Move! Yes, sir. The suspect has a gun. To ensure our comrades' safety, we must coordinate with relevant departments to determine Wan Xiaowen's precise location and arrest him. Traffic police, please locate the vehicle with license plate Yu BB1386. SWAT, please intercept and arrest him. Captain Han, Wan Xiaowen jumped into the Zhuangyuan River and swam toward the southwest. Senior Sima, you and Meijuan guard exit A and B. You stay alert in your current position. Don't push me! Are you okay? Wait. Wait. Officer, I beg you. Please release me for now, okay? After I redeem my son, I'll turn myself in. I swear. My dad has been killed by them. If I don't deliver the money soon, my son will be gone too. I'm begging you. Junfeng! Son! Son! Stop. Guo Meilian, I brought the money. Let my son go. Give me the money first. Let my son go, and I'll give you the money. Okay. Wan Xiaowen. Are you fooling me? Dad. Take him away. Dad. Tell me, why did you rob? I was forced. She tricked me. Okay? Go. Guo Meilian. Wan Xiaowen. Why are you here? This is my shop. I'm the owner. Your shop? It's amazing. We haven't seen each other for years. Yes, you've become more handsome after so many years. We went to the same school. I had a crush on her in school. After graduation, we went our separate ways and lost contact. After my wife passed away, I didn't think about finding someone else. But when I met her last time, we chatted and I found out that she's not married. I started to have feelings again. Are you happy to buy so many? I'm so happy today. You're amazing. You bought me so many. If you like it, I can buy the whole world for you. Let's find a place to eat. Wow, so cute. Is he handsome? Yes, even more handsome than you. Of course. My father has uremia. He needs dialysis every week. I have no money to pay for it. Your father's illness has been diagnosed with uremia. The current treatment plans are hemodialysis and kidney transplant. But it may not be possible to find a suitable kidney in the short term. Even if we find the kidney, it'll cost a lot. Yang Wei sympathized with me and paid for all of my father's medical expenses. Out of gratitude, I had to be completely obedient. But Yang Wei often abuses me. Sometimes, he doesn't even treat me like a human. I've had enough of this. Gu Meilian said she wants me to accompany her on a cruise to the Three Gorges. She took me to a cruise ship which was normal during the day. But at night, it turned into a casino. She said she made a fortune there. She won a lot of money in a while. She asked me to play a few rounds. At first, I was afraid and cautious. But I won several rounds. After that, I bet more and more and lost more and more. Gu Mi contacted the shareholders. I borrowed money to win back my money. In the end, I lost all my money and owed a huge gambling debt. My clothing shop has been losing money all along. I sold my house. I put everything into it. Now the deadline for repayment is approaching. I'll find a way to pay the debt as soon as possible. Where is David? Where is David? Don’t hurt my family. I'll pay you back soon. Very soon. 400,000, one finger for each 100,000 of it. If you don't pay me back, I'll kill your whole family. I was scared. I didn't want to implicate my father and son. I had no choice so I decided to rob. What about Xiao Laoyao? He's a motorbiker nearby. He is familiar with the area. Xiao Laoyao found my phone and tried to blackmail me for 300,000. I'm here to collect water and electricity bills. I wanted to take this money and live a better life with my father. I got the money. Oh no! What happened to Wan Guihua’s death? His death was an accident. I found his home. Who are you looking for? We are the police. You are the police? Why aren't you wearing uniforms? Will the police dress like you? - Will the police have beard? - Where's your ID card? Your son robbed us of our money. Where is he? Officer, I really regret it. I caused my father's death. My son almost... Officer, I know I was wrong. I regret it so much. I know I was wrong. I'm guilty. I deserve to die. I deserve to die. All right. You can remember this bloody lesson for the rest of your life. During the investigation, it was discovered that behind the gambling cruise, it's not just Yang Wei alone, there is a bigger force hidden in it. The two suspects are willing to redeem themselves and cooperate with the police for further action. All departments must cooperate closely according to the plan and complete the mission successfully. Yes, sir. Our team. Be careful, everyone. Be careful. Come on. Be careful. Don't rush. Line up to board the ship. Slow down. [Yuzhou Port Pier 8] This is two million yuan. Please check. No need. You always keep your word. This is your reward. Thank you, boss. I'll hand in the profit of this month. What's he talking about? I don't understand. Baby. I miss you so much. Let me kiss you. No. What? You're a dog that can't be fed. I'm just a dog that can't be fed. I'm going to teach you a lesson today. No. You know how hard it is to collect debts. Fine. Hey, let me ask you. Where did David go? He Just hooked up with a girl. He must be busy now. Just like me. This is his hobby. It's beautiful over there too. The bridge over there. That bridge is great. Hello, sir. Our game is about to start. Okay. This way, please. Sir, where are you going? I'm a little seasick. I need some fresh air. Let's go. Sir, are you okay? I'm fine. I feel much better now. I'll go back. - Thank you. - You’re welcome. Sorry. I got seasick just now. Are you okay? I'm fine. OK. I'm just not used to it. How is the game going? I'm tired of waiting. Are you done? What are you doing? It's been so long. Don't lock the door. I'm coming. Wait for me. Hurry up. What are you doing? Open the door. Honey. Come on. What did you say? All bet on small. Wait. What? - I changed my mind. - No, you can’t change it. All bet on big. The rule here is once you place your bet, you can't change it. Why can't I change it until it's open? Hey. I won. Sorry. Something happened. Please pause for the moment. Go back to the cabin. Let's continue later, okay? What about the money I won? We'll talk about it later. Let's go back to the cabin first. So this is the mechanism. Who is talking? No wonder the police didn't find it. Yang Wei, you're really scheming. Who are you? We're from the Criminal Investigation Unit of Yuzhou Branch. Yang Wei, you're under arrest. It's you. Yang Wei. You brought me to this path of no return. We've caused harm to too many people. It's time to end this. You bitch! I'll kill you! Freeze! Hurry up! Don't move! Don't move! Yongqiang. Yongqiang. Yongqiang! - Yongqiang! - Get an ambulance now! Qiang! Yongqiang. Yongqiang. [Thanks to the Police for Always Serving the People] Migrant workers, today is a good day for all of you. After a period of investigation by the police, the money is back. Great. Go home and reunite with your families. The police are here. Do your best. Come in. Wait a moment. Go get the money with the accountant. Yang Wei, you must hand in this month's profit on time. So you suspect me? Boss, I'll hand in this month's profit right away. Don't you feel ashamed? Things are getting worse. Now it's all exposed. What am I supposed to do? I don't care. Handle it yourselves. Don't get me involved. Hmph, you're all idiots! How dare you steal my money to pay me back! You idiots! What's going on? What happened? Guo Meilian. Don't worry too much about your father. After the 18th Party Congress, the government has intensified poverty alleviation efforts. Your father has been recognized as a targeted poor household. The state and government will cover all his medical expenses and daily living expenses. Focus on your rehabilitation and try to reunite with your family soon. Xiao Laoyao, our baby and I will wait for you. Xiao Laoyao, our baby and I will wait for you. Xiao Laoyao, our baby and I will wait for you. Xiao Laoyao, our baby and I will wait for you. Xiao Laoyao, our baby and I will wait for you. Xiao Laoyao, our baby and I will wait for you. Xiao Laoyao, our baby and I will wait for you. - Xiao Laoyao... - I’m going to be a father.
