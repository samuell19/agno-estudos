Well, there you go. No! No! Stop. You will do it for me, and I'll let you go. Tell me. I'll do anything you want. Come here, boy. Good boy, Butterscotch. Do you have anything I can give him? Anything sweet? Where did you get this? Someone left it on their table at the diner. You can't give this to horses. What's it for? It's made out of cactus or something. It's supposed to open your mind. Good boy. Look at me. Do I look like a queen? 'Cause I'm gonna be a rodeo queen this year. I'm gonna win that crown and that Chevrolet that comes with it. I'm gonna marry Taylor and we're gonna get a big house. I believe it. I'm gonna tour the world, I'm gonna be a star. You are a star. What are you gonna do when I'm a star? Seriously, Heidi... You can't just live at that truck stop. Work at that freaking diner. Truckers winking at you, pinching your ass. Don't you have any dreams? Yeah. But I like my job. It's better than what I had before. Yeah, well, that's not enough. Look. - I did it. - What is it? It's just my thumbprint in some salt dough. Spread it with some gold paint, stuck it on a chain. It's a necklace. So Taylor doesn't forget me when he deploys. I don't think he's gonna forget you. Hey, can you drop me off here? - Here? - Yeah. You want me to just leave you here by the side of the road? I have a friend picking me up. Who? You think you're my only friend. Hey. You're my best friend. You know that, right? See you later. Can I get you anything else for the time being? Your number, honey. Where have you been? Church. What did you ask Jesus for? I don't ask Jesus for nothing. Right. Mmm. I did whisper to the preacher once. I wanted the Holy Spirit to fill me up. And be inside me. You know, everyone's lining up to say stuff to the preacher and the girl sitting next to me said that's what I should say. Did you say it wrong? I think so. He looked at me with his bug eyes and said... "The just shall receive by faith alone." You know, I do have faith. In what? I know how to get along with this bad world. Can I get you anything else for the time being? How long have you lived here? A while. Ever see this girl, my Sarah? Just in the poster we got here. I'm sorry. There's this new girl that's missing, um, everybody's out looking for her 'cause she's some pretty, rich girl from the city. Lorna Sage? You heard about her, right? Everybody's clean forgotten about my Sarah. And she's still missing. She's my baby. I'm sorry. - Heidi. - Hmm? This came for you, honey. Here you go, sir. Uh, thank... - Hey. - Hey. I still have an hour of my shift left. Well, I didn't have anything else to do, so can I just hang out? - Sure. Do you want a beer? - Yeah. Come. Are you done with this seat? So, what's up? I got a letter. From my father's sister. She lives near a Cap'corn, beside the sea. Okay. She runs a hotel. She sounds so nice. She found me, I don't even know how. So, when are you leaving? I'm not gonna leave. I might just go visit her. Come on, Heidi. You should do it. It's no kind of life living in that freaking truck stop, working at the diner and hanging out with me, here. Pretty sure she can give you a job, as well. Right? Maybe, but... I'd miss you, though. Yeah, um... I gotta keep on working. Do you wanna hang out later? I mean, I... I can wait. I'll give you a ride. I said I'd hang out with Gus and Cherry later. I gotta clean up. There's some real losers in here. - You're just gonna get hassled. - I don't care. Okay. Well, see you in a bit. Such a bummer ball, my husband. I just want to dance. He's here because of me. He'd do anything for me. Come here, baby. So, what's your story, Heidi? Hmm... Let me tell you about Heidi. She came to Desert Dior with this real piece-of-work boyfriend. Didn't you, Heidi? Mmm? Yeah. How long ago was that? It was almost five years. "Almost five years." We met at a bar, remember? I asked her if she wanted to dance. I was drunk. I said yes. Yeah. I feel free when I'm dancing. Heidi's a yes-girl. "Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am." Yes, Jane. Do you wanna try some? Say yes, yes-girl. - It makes you know things. - No. Yes. Yes, girl. - No. No! - Yes, yes-girl. Whoa. No. Are we going to this party in Clay City or what? Yeah. Yeah. Wake up, wake up, wake up! Wake up. Look! Taylor proposed. Look. Can you see? It's a dolphin. I opened the door, and he was on his knees. In his ACUs. Isn't that romantic? Yeah. It is. We have to get married this weekend. He's going away. It's the only chance we'll get. You know, there are all sorts of benefits once you get married, Heidi. And I can go and live in that base at Fort America. Have you ever seen these houses? They're so freaking huge. Well, I'm not gonna have to work in that casino anymore. Fort America's 100 miles away. No, it's like an hour drive. Yeah, in a Black Hawk maybe. What do you care if I go and live in Fort America? I won't ever see you. You're leaving town anyway. Jane, will you stop this? I'm not leaving. I'm just saying. After you. Thank you. - Thank you. - Bye. My God. Okay. What's happening, Taylor? Oh, my God. Heidi, come here. Come, girl. Are you kidding? - Are you freaking kidding me? - Don't be mad. - I'm not... Oh, my God. - Don't be mad. - I can take my truck. I'll get a ride. - Thank you, Heidi. I cannot believe this, Taylor. I cannot believe you would do this on our wedding day! For God's sakes. - I can explain. - What the hell happened? Can you tell me? The guys and I were doing some donuts in the parking lot earlier. - Just don't be mad. - On our wedding day? Are you freaking kidding me, Taylor? What the hell's wrong with you? - Will you calm down? - For sure. - You're gonna fix it, right? - I'll fix it. Oh, well, you've said that before. I've heard you say that three weeks in a row. - And look at our car now. - That's not even true. That didn't even happen. Jesus Christ. For God's sakes. For crying out loud, Taylor, hurry up. Rainbow. I guess I'll take this opportunity to give this to you. Thank you, sir. - Congratulations. - Thanks, man. Okay, here it goes. I'm gonna miss you so much. Yeah. Me too. It's you I'm gonna be fighting for. You're not going to a real war, Taylor. What? I said you're not going to a real war, Taylor. You're just putting out fires and starting new ones. It's all just pretend. I don't think you know a lot about it. Well, I know things without being told, you know? Like what? Like what your dreams are. What you are thinking. And what am I thinking? You're thinking... ...about the life we're gonna have together. You're right. Yeah, I am. But you don't know what I'm thinking. Do you? You don't have that gift. Can I help you? You wanna go out sometime? Oh, you can't think of a reason to say no. I just didn't think it would be polite to tell you. Something wrong with me? I'm sure you're fine. I got it. You think I'm, um, a little too old for you. Maybe. Oh! Ow. Well, sometimes that's a good thing for a girl like you. You seem very sure of what I should and shouldn't be doing. You're not from around here, are you? No. I'm not. Neither am I. We're outsiders. Hey. Come in. The house is great. My neighbors are real sweet. There's a clubhouse. You can play bridge. So I said, "I can play 21." Yeah. They don't play 21. My neighbor, Cheryl, her husband's in E3. You know, I can give you a ride any time you want. No, it's fine. The car will be fixed soon. You ready for the rodeo? I'm gonna be the queen. That other girl has never even barrel-raced before. She's just a pageant girl. You know that guy, Lyle? Cowboy, he's been hanging around the diner? The one with the wedding ring? I don't think he's married. Then why would he be wearing a wedding ring? He asked me out. Sure he did. I'm sure you said yes. I might say yes. He wasn't wearing a wedding ring. Don't say I didn't warn you. You wanna stay with me when Taylor is away? No. Thank you. You know, things are different now. What's different? What the fuck is wrong, Jane? Don't you get tired of feeling totally powerless sometimes? Every time a trucker or a loser just looks at you and says something stupid and grabs your tits and grabs your ass? You like that guy. He's fine and nice. You think he wants to take you home for a soda, honey? I get it, Jane. But he's not that guy. Maybe. Maybe you are just different. It's all different now. Maybe you and I have always been different. We always have been. But we need each other. I don't need you anymore, Heidi. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Desert Rolling Rodeo. You look beautiful. Thank you. Come here. I want to show you something. You want some? Oh, no. I already had a beer before you got here. I only allow myself one. So you really a cowboy? I grew up with horses. Recently, I'm learning how to rope. You mean like a hobby? Yeah. Are you rich? No. Uh... I mean, I do fine. Okay, you're right. I'm not a cowboy. So what do you do for a job? I'm out here setting up a center. What sort of center? Uh, customs, immigration, border control. Uh, we set up little villages for people while they're waiting to have their deportation cases heard. Oh, so, like the government? You setting up one of those holding pens for Mexicans? All right, if you wanna call it that, fine. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. All right, I get the politics, but you can't have people just come in here illegally. It has to be organized. Are you... Aren't you Mexican? What does that have to do with anything? Why do you do that job? I deal with everybody. Just like you. Oh, glorious, the stars and stripes. The red, white and blue. This gal has been around a lot of years and she's seen a lot and she has endured a lot. If she was able to speak she'd say, "The red in my fabric stands for the self-sacrificing courage. "The white stands for liberty and justice. "And the blue, the blue of heaven "stands for loyalty and faith." We may love our country, but we want something better for ourselves. She stands tall in her boots to bring strength and pride. For those who struggle with the reality we're living in... Who thinks they were born for more than this? Who believes the American Dream has been twisted? The American Dream has been taken away from us. The American Dream has been taken away from me. The past is poison. Congratulations. For what? It's a goddamn consolation crown I didn't win. Doesn't matter. They can all go to hell. I'm done. I want a real one. A real crown? Yeah. A real crown. Oh, what? Whoa! Whoa. Howdy there. What's that there for? It's there so I wouldn't take off my shirt. Whoa. What happened to you? Oh, that's... That's just there to keep me from taking my shirt off. I had an operation. - Yeah? - Mmm. Why? Well, they took out my entire stomach. If you can believe that. - Your whole stomach? - Mmm-hmm. What happened? I collapsed in the shower. And when they took me to the hospital, the doctors said, "Well, "you're gonna die. "You have a huge tumor. "I mean, we could try something but even that's a risk." Damn. I'm sorry. So I didn't die... But I'm like an old car. They just pieced me back together. And I gotta go back to the shop all the time. And that means... I have got to chew my food! Do you think she's okay? That girl? She'll be fine. Mmm. Hey, it's Jane. I can't pick up the phone, so leave a message after the tone. Hey, Jane. Give me a call. I'm worried about you. Jane. Jane? Weren't you friends? Not really. She didn't seem like she wanted to be friends with the wives. So you don't think she's been home, or... I don't know. I saw her taking the bus last week. What bus? I know, right? There ain't really a bus. You have to flag down a Greyhound. Who does that? We have cars. Where do you think she was going? Beats me. How's it going? This is Taylor. Sorry I couldn't get to the phone right now. Leave your name, I'll give you a call back. Hi, Taylor. It's Heidi. I'm at your house. Can't get hold of Jane. Give me a call. McKane Auto Repair. Hi. Did Jane... Did she pick up her car from you? No, it's ready and all. Are you gonna come get it? Heidi, where are you? Where do you want to meet? Let's meet at the casino. I want to see if anyone's seen Jane. Don't worry about her. That girl was cruel to you. She doesn't mean it. I'll get us a room. I miss you. I'll see you there. Uh, I am going to stay. - Hey! - Hey. Hey. - How are you? - Good. How are you? I'm great. - What? - Are you okay? Yeah, I am. Great. Why? This is Cherry. Cherry, Heidi, Cherry, Heidi. We met before. Didn't you say you're not supposed to drink? I'm gonna get you what you want, which is a beer and not one of these cherry whatevers. I'll be right back. I'm gonna take my money. I'm gonna take my money. - Oh, shit. - Whoa. Have you seen Jane? Has she been here? You mean since she quit? Yeah. Maybe she's on vacation. She's not on vacation. Why do you care about her so much? Don't you have somebody you care about? Somebody you love? A friend? Hey, where do you get that green cactus stuff? Why? You want some? There's two types of people in this universe. You're one kind, he's the other. I know you, Heidi. You'd break yourself backwards for someone else. For Jane. And he... He'll always be okay. 'Cause he looks out for himself. You are so fucking wrong. I'd do anything for her. Come on, let's get out of here. Thanks for the play. Thanks for the tip. Take care, Heidi. - Sorry. - Excuse me. - Hey, what are you doing? Stop it. - This is Jane's. - Did she give it to you? - Cherry made it for me. Hey. Shall we go up to the room? What's the room number? Okay. Oh, my God. Come on. Oof. Fuck. Does your wife know what you're doing right now? The things you say to me? No. But it's not... We're friends. When I was sick... She stopped looking at me like I was a man. And you... You look at me like... What I am. Or what I used to be. I could help you, you know. I can help you get set up somewhere. I don't need to be set up anywhere. People take advantage of girls like you. You don't have family, you don't have money. And they end up doing things. No, I've seen it. I know what I'm talking about. Come on. Bye. Hey. Where's Butterscotch? What? The horse that's usually here. I don't know. I'll pay you if you tell me what I want to know. Yeah? How much? Hundred dollars. Somebody took off with him about a week or so ago. Who took off with him? Some guys that work for the boss. Who's your boss? I don't know his name, I just call him "Boss." He just comes, he finds me, and he gives me jobs sometimes. Where can I find him? Um, some of the guys say he lives up near the mines. - Which mines? - Gypsum mines. He's a big guy and talks kind of funny. Did you ever hear of some rich guy who lives out near Gypsum Mines? No. Big guy? Fat or tall? I don't know. There are all kinds of weirdos, stay out there, sleeping in the caves. Protecting their land. She's about 5'7", and she has long, brown hair. She lives up at the base in Fort America, but she's not there, and... Her back door was open. And her neighbor says that she hasn't been there in days. I can't get a hold of her husband. She's not a kid. She's not a runaway, no, she's... She's missing. Mrs. Ruiz. Mrs. Ruiz. Hi. What's your name again? Heidi. Like the cartoon. Have you heard from Jane? Why would I? Little switch got everything she wanted. She's not even showing up for church anymore. They said it's better if a family member fills out the report. What report? A missing person's report. "Missing person's report"? Are you a crazy girl? I don't need any cops around. Jane ain't missing. Hey, Heidi. There's a phone call for you. - Who is it? - Some woman. Jane? Heidi? It's Marina. - Your aunt. Lily's sister. - My fa... Hi, Marina. Did you get my letter? Yeah, I did. Well, that's great. - How are you? - I'm okay. Hello? Yeah. Hey, sweetie, I'm here. So are you gonna come visit? I'd love to see what a child of Lily's looks like. My friend's gone missing. What do I do? How do you know she didn't just wander off? Well, she left her car. Her house, all her things. - She wouldn't just leave. - Well... What did you do first when Sarah went missing? I didn't realize Sarah was gone until it was too late. But you're still looking. I'm searching for her bones. When the posters first went up, some guy called who said, we'd find her a few miles north of here, where the railroad used to run. Someone else called and said we'd find her down a mine. We found some clothes that might've been hers. Heat of the day, it's cool in the nights. Destroys anything that could be helpful. Then there's the gossip. Someone said they saw her on a bridge. I stopped listening a long time ago. There is only one way she could've died. One place she could be buried. The desert, it'll swallow you up. Stop it. Shut up. You're a nightmare. Hold the food. Well, we don't give out information. See, that's our whole deal. I know she bought a gun here. People have a right to their own privacy. - That's stupid. - It's not stupid. It's the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Now, maybe your friend deserves her privacy. Maybe she's trying to protect herself from somebody. That's why people buy guns. This is someone who didn't need a gun. Who, as far as I know, wasn't in danger from anybody but herself. Show me your hand. It's all right. I'm not gonna bite you. Show me your hand. Right there. Mmm. You've been having dreams. You are in trouble. You best stop looking for your friend. She's the trouble. Where is she? The more you look for her, the worse your dreams will get. I remember her. Oh, yeah. Heading for Clay City, said she's gonna set the world on fire. Jane's always saying things like that. Well, I've got a .38 special. Thank you. Fit that pretty little hand just like a glove. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. How are you? - Good. - Yeah? That is Jane's, isn't it? No. We all made them for each other. Everybody. We all made them for each other. Is she alive? She's in a better place. You okay? I got something that'll help you find Jane. No. - You'll love it. Just try it. - Can you tell me what... What happened to her? I won't tell you what happened, you'll just know. You'll just know. Come on. Take me with you. We're home. That's Ren. You'll meet him. Jane's here. I can feel her. It makes you know things without being told. It makes you know the truth. This place, the infusion. It makes your dreams feel just like they're real, like they're happening right in front of your eyes. Ren says it helps you deal with your traumas. I had a dream like this. I keep having this dream. In the dream, I died. I'm at a motel... It's different. Staying in this room with a balcony overlooking water. I have a glass of whiskey in my hand. Someone's behind me. I fall... No. I'm pushed. My neck's twisted. I died. I die... Looking up into their face. Who pushed you? Jane? I've been looking for you. Why? Because you're my best friend. And I love you. Don't worry, honey. We're all friends here. Everyone is here because they wanna be here. You've taken these people. - What? - You've taken these people. You chose to come here. You asked to come here, didn't you? Heidi, there are two types of people in this world. Those who are lost and powerless, and those who have found their place and their power. Which are you? - I'm... - You're lost, aren't you? You've been rushing around trying to please everyone. You don't have to do that anymore. So you feel at home. You can be part of something. You can have power. We're a family, Heidi. If someone harms us, we deal with them. - Close the door, lady. - Hey. Get the hell outta here. You can stay, you know. If you want. What do you want? Do you want a family? Yes, I do. I feel your pain. You've been hurt. Do you know how I know? I felt the same pain. That dark, hidden pain. You didn't have a real father, did you? No. And your mother? She died. You don't know how to receive love. You don't recognize it. You don't know how to fully give in. You're always knocking on the wrong door. Because you've never been shown the way. What is this stuff? It opens your heart. And your mind. It makes your dreams come true. You need to improve. I am. I was talking to Ren. Talking about how you're not living up to your full potential. Cherry, that's bullshit, and you know it. - Okay, I've reaped more than anybody here. - Like... Let's give Heidi a go. What, you've never shot a shotgun? I have. Nice. I just don't like them. Flower can't go into town. She has to be back here. Maybe you can do it. I'm just saying, I don't want to go see Bobby. It should be a girl. Maybe Jane should go. Jane, you can go. You good, Heidi? Mmm. I feel you. Yeah, I definitely can go. I think she's come the longest way so far. Honey's feeling stronger than she ever has. I can feel her strength growing. She's learning more about herself and her body. Isn't that right, Honey? Flower's commitment to her family is stronger than ever. And we belong to each other. How about Heidi? Is anyone feeling Heidi? Rainbow? Heidi... Heidi wants to be part of our family. But she's scared and suspicious. She lives in the past. The past is poison. The past is poison. The past is poison. She's weak with fear. We don't use such negative words, Rainbow. Get the hell off me. Get off me, pervert! Don't touch me. Hey! - Get the fuck back in here! - Get off of me. Heidi. You're a diamond. - I'm a diamond? - You're a diamond. That's mine. We share everything, Rainbow. You know that. That trick doesn't seem to work on me. - You can't. - I can do whatever I want. I want to dance on my own, Jane. We should go. I'm not leaving. Jane... How long have you even known these people for? I need to take care of Butterscotch. Jane, I'm not leaving you here. I, Jane Briana Ruiz, deserve better than what I got. You did fine. I didn't. You might as well have buried me in that house in Fort America. Let me tell you something, Heidi. I want you to understand. We don't have to take the bullshit that is out there, we don't. We don't have to be treated like something that someone just steps on. I spent my whole life trying to smile at someone for a casino chip. Fucking someone for dinner. Little humiliations. Little humiliations here and there. Men using me. People using me, men using me. Telling me who I am. Jane, I get that, too. No. It happens. Now I'm the boss. No, you're not. Ren is. All that stuff, geez, it's still happening to you. He's shown us our own strength. Do you want that, Heidi? Do you want that? Don't you wanna feel that power? Do you wanna feel it? That stuff, that drug makes you think that you have power, but it's a trick. It's not real. No. You've tried it. You've tried it, you know it. It pulls you into everything, and it makes you know everything. Yeah, you... You just... You just don't get it. And that's a shame 'cause Ren thought you did. Fuck that, Jane. Fuck that! - Come on. - Leave me. This place is fucking dangerous. It's fucking dangerous! You're being used. Hey. If you come with me... I promise... I promise you, we'll go to Cap'corn. Hey. You wanted to be a star. We could do that. Come with me. There's nothing for me there. - No, come on, just come with me. - No. - Get off me. - No, come on, Jane. - Let's go. Let's... - Get off me! If you disappeared, no one would even notice. I was the only person who noticed when you disappeared. You don't have any power, Jane. Bye. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. You wanna come with me? I'm good right here. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Do you know this woman? Was she famous? - Do you know her? - Kind of. I knew her as Sarah. I don't remember her. People just drop them off. We use them as wallpaper. If you're a fan, I mean, you can have it. - Really? - Yeah. Go ahead, take it off. We'll put another one up. What's her name again? Sarah Fields. Hi. I'm... I'm looking for Marina. Oh, my God. You're Heidi. - Marina? - Yes. Well, come here, let me hug you. Lily's daughter. You're so gorgeous. If you know restaurants, you can do something with this place. - Really? - Yeah. Well, I don't know who'd eat there. I would. How did you end up in that place in the desert? I went there with a boy, and... Once we got there, he wasn't so good. Well, I'll tell you what I've learned. 'Cause I know this well. Hurtful acts are the transference to others of the degradation that we bear in ourselves. He only hurt you because he was hurting. Are you religious? Not really... But yes, yeah... I am. I'm waiting. I mean, the only thing that I really know about God is that he is what we are not. And every sin is an attempt to fly from emptiness. Something like that.
