BLUE DEMON THOUSAND MASKS THE AVENGING CHAMPIONS THE KILLER DOCTOR BLACK SHADOW SHADOWS (THE GIANT) THE AVENGING SHADOW Ladies and gentlemen... tonight... the most sensational dual meets wrestling match... awaited by all the fans. They'll wrestle until two fall without time limit. In this corner, the Death Brothers. In this other one, the Killer Doctor! Thousand Masks! The captain of the team is the invincible Blue Demon! The attack we've just suffered... - can only come... - From Black Hand. Although five years ago we eliminated him and his gang... it's obvious he's alive. Supposing you're right, why would they want to kill us? To take revenge. Remember he served a foreign power. We ruined his plans and turned him in to Interpol. From now we must be on alert and keep in touch. - Who could it be? - C'mon, open. Elsa! What's all this havoc with the Police and reporters? Weren't you in the wrestling match? No, I couldn't come on time. What's going on, guys? Thousand Masks, you're hurt! It's nothing. Demon will tell you about it. Tomorrow you'll read it in the newspapers. And don't forget what I told you. Blue, don't forget that tomorrow night... you all have to be in the rehearsal of the Miss Mexico contest. Don't worry. Before that, I'm going out with my goddaughter, Miss Chihuahua. Don't you show off. We will support ours, too. You are so useless! You've failed terribly. It's because you didn't follow my instructions exactly. Five years ago, Blue Demon and his gang ruined my plans. But now, a new powerful country offers millions of dollars... for my scientific discoveries. Have you understood? Millions of dollars! You will all be rich and powerful, too. But we must get rid of Blue Demon and his mates. In spite of our failure tonight... I promise you that very soon Blue Demon will die. I hope so... for your own good. I'll be delighted. Of course, for all of you. For you too, little one. Antonio, wait. Here. Start the motorcycle. Yes, of course. For you, too. Of course, yes. For all of you. So, instead of Blue Demon... it was his assistant who died, right? Idiots! It wasn't my fault, boss. sheer luck saved him. I'll have to use other resources to crush them. Tomorrow you'll kidnap the goddaughters of the masked ones. I'll also use them for my hibernation experiments. Blue Demon and his mates will defend them with their lives. The only ones who can confront those savages... are them and Black shadow. We are just useless midgets. What would you say if I gave you enough strength to defeat them? You doubt it. I'll give each one of you the strength of ten athletes. Come here! Get in. Get in. Now you, number 2. One. get in. Shadow, take him to the mat and wrestle with him. But boss... - Wrestle with him. - Okay. That's enough. Are you convinced now? I'm very worried about you, godfather. You just have to worry to win the contest. If you're elected Miss Mexico, I'll be very proud of you. Twice they tried to kill you. And they'll try to do it again. I can assure you. I have more lives than a cat. You're a great man, godfather. And you're a delightful girl. That's why you have to win. Remember we come from Nuevo Leon. And what about us from Jalisco? Don't be so sure, godfather. The other ones are very pretty. Remember our saying... "Jalisco never loses. and when it loses, it kills." I hope so. I wish could be the one. You are the most beautiful of all. Don't exaggerate, godfather. But thank you, anyway. My mates will be very jealous when you win. If you keep on flattering me, Elsa will be jealous. Of course, dear. But fortunately, he's your uncle. Ladies, remember, this is the final rehearsal. I hope you don't forget the instructions you've been given. The way of walking and acting. I want you to know I wish you all good luck. Miss Chihuhua. Miss Sonora. Miss Puebla. Miss Jalisco. Miss Nuevo Leon. Miss Veracruz. Miss Yucatan. Miss Guerrero. Miss Sinaloa. Copied. Over and out. When the masked men arrive, you know what we must do. Ladies, you can go to your dressing rooms to get changed. I can't believe it. Those midgets have a supernatural strength. Yes, but they suddenly lost it. - Let's follow them. - No, wait. It's useless. We wouldn't reach them. Very well. You'll serve perfectly well. Tomorrow I'll start running my experiments. Take them! Leave me. Don't touch me. Leave me. No, please! Help me! Please, help! C'mon, walk! Boss, we've got Thousand Masks. I know everything. Don't worry. I have solved that small problem. I have adapted an electrode to these bangles... through which, and remote controlled... you'll receive... Fit it to your wrists. Here. Here. With this, Blue Demon and his masked men... will be under my power. Ready? I'll connect the energy. Gosh! What can't understand... is how he was able to escape from prison. Neither can I. I've no doubt that the mastermind of the kidnaps is Black Hand. Which means they'll also try to kidnap... Miss Sonora and Veracruz. And Elsa. He's right, shadow. Therefore, you'll take turns to guard and protect them. Meanwhile, I'll look for information in my database... to find the hideout of that mad man. Very well thought. Yes. Who is it? Do you recognize my voice, Blue Demon? Black Hand! Exactly. It's time to settle things out. My men have just kidnapped other two girls. I exchange the life of the five of them... if tomorrow you come alone to where tell you. Write it down. And don't try to track my call down. You'd never discover where I'm calling from. Okay. I'll be there. As soon as the frost disappears... they'll become ice statues. They'll be able to remain like that for many years. During their sleep... we'll program their brains for them to obey. It's a great triumph, boss. The secret service of the country that supports us... will be able to kidnap their enemies and program their brains... so that they'll faithfully serve the cause. That's what I'll do with Blue Demon and his friends... as soon as I have them under my power. I'll be on guard all night. Those who are in real danger are you and the others. Go and rest, sweetheart. I'll lock all the doors. If I hear something strange, I'll immediately phone you. Quit your profession. What would be the point if they killed you and I was left? I couldn't live without you. Hello? Hello! Hello? Blue? I've just phoned Shadow. He could hardly talk. I heard a strange noise and he didn't talk any more. I'm on my way. "Blue Demon, I'll return Revenging Shadow... if tomorrow at midnight you go to the abandoned warehouse... which is shown in the map." It's a trap, Blue. And one of the most dangerous. We will all go. It's precisely what Black Hand wants. - He wants us all to go. - What trap will he have prepared? - We'll know if we go there. - Let's go! Watch out! You'll never beat my friends, Black Hand. Imbecile! In a way, I'm glad your friends are strong and brave. They're the type of men I need to serve me. And I have a surprise for you. Tomorrow you'll have the chance to fight for our life. If you do okay, you'll have saved your life. So far, miraculously Elsa has escaped. We must protect her. Go with her to Shadow's cabin next to the lake. It's a place nobody knows. Not even Elsa. She'll be safe there. We have to find Black Hand's hideout. - Let's go. - Yeah, let's go. Take him! He's dead! With this drug, he'll be submitted to my will. It's useless, Blue. We'll never find Black Hand's hideout. After five ears... I'm sure I've forgotten a piece of information. I won't rest until finding it. Very well. Close the crates and take them away. At long last I found what I was looking for. Black Hand used a clandestine runway... for smuggling and spying maneuvers. This is the place. Shadow, the lack of news is making me nervous. I feel the same. Why don't we go skiing? That way we'll calm down. I think it's a great idea. - Let's go. - Yes, let's go. - Let's hide Behind that cabin - Yes. Revenging Shadow is under the influence of a drug. I think that if we try to help him, he'll attack us. Yes, but we must do something to help him. As soon as the plane arrives, we'll take the crates out. - I'll attack from that side. - No, hold on. There's something very strange in all this. - Is everything ready? - Yes. We must hurry. - We must attack now. - No, Thousand Masks. First, we must find out what those crates contain. We must open it. Change course... and head to Mexico City's airport. And don't try to fool us. - She let go. - Maybe she was tired. Blue! Thousand Masks! Hurry, They want to kill Shadow and the Killer Doctor. Thousand Masks, Call Interpol, please. Tell them that the girls are in a hibernation state... so that they can do whatever necessary. I'll also tell them we'll turn in five Black Hand's spies. There are only four. The divers and the pilot. She's another spy. The most dangerous of them all. She informed Black Hand about all our plans. When she phoned to tell me that something happened to Shadow... she did it to keep up appearances. I bet she suggested going in the boat. That's true. Now I understand why she let go in time. She knew at what time the bomb would go off. Fortunately, before bringing you here... we knew where Black Hand's hideout was. Gentlemen... it's a long time since Elsa hasn't be in touch with me. And that is a sign of danger. When you fire this gun... your enemy will be paralyzed for a few seconds. It's a precious time to take advantage. - Do you understand? - Yes, boss. Leave him! Don't attack him. He's drugged. Hold him. What on earth is going on here, Blue? Remember Black Hand kidnapped you. It's obvious he drugged you. Now I remember everything. Thank you for saving me. - Watch out! - Leave him to me. A long time ago I wanted to settle things out. Silence. Silence, please. I now want to ask you a round of applause... for her gracious Majesty, Marisela I. OCR and ressynch: Kilo
