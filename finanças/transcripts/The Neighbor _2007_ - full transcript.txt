[music playing] [groaning] You OK? You all right? Hit me. Ah, OK. Ah. Thanks. Oh, man. [music playing] Kenneth. Kenneth. You're not hearing me. This is no longer a negotiation. Yes, I understand your position and it makes sense to you. No. No. No. No. You're embellishing issues to angle for a higher return. Well it was your responsibility to-- to investigate and you didn't. That's not our problem. So either you signed the agreement or we bring in other investors. No. No. No. No. I'm a lady. We don't make threats. You have 10 minutes to call David back. That's quite a confident stands for a 98 billion deal. He'll play ball. Get him. Kate, do I have the budget? Everything's in there. Great. What is it? Grocery list. [gasp] It's not too late to have it catered. No. No. No. I want this to be a special. I know she's my best friend and I've totally neglected her since she moved back. [music playing] [coughing] [honk] [music playing] [footsteps] [door slamming] [footsteps] Is that mine? Yes. It is. I've told you not to touch my mail. Well then, tell the postman stop putting your mail in my box. Uh, Is that sweat? Yes. I sweat when I run which is what I was doing when you almost ran me over right now. Mr. Westley, my attorneys are still waiting to hear from you. My last also was more than generous. Miss Letellier, I'm not interested in your generosity. I've been living in this building since before you moved in the country. The renovations on my side have been completed and keeping the workers on hold costs a lot of money. Which was presumptuous on your part. I only told Mr. Martin that I would think about moving out of the building. I've thought about it. I'm staying. It's my unit. I own it. And I live in it. And I'm staying. Oh, yeah? We'll see about that. Yes. We will. Mr. Martin, please. When I bought both units, you told me that Mr. Westley would be out by now. You said it was a formality. Huh? He's still here. He refuses to leave. And as long as he remains, I can not continue renovations. This is not my problem. I don't care. It's not my problem. Come on, Mr. Martin. That's what you said three months ago. You know what? Fix it. [plop] Oh, no! Merde! Merde! Oh, merde. Oh. Ooh. Oh. [music playing] That stuff's toxic, you know. It's what that McVeigh kid used to blow up the Federal Building. And it stinks. Like your sneakers. Like your cheese. Like your sweat. Like your gas guzzler. Like your beer breath. Like your-- No! ANSWERING MACHINE: Thursday 3:00 PM. FLORIA RIAMONDI (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hi, Jeff. It's Floria Riamondi, from Gallery Pescucci, again. I know you're sick of me calling, but I'd really like you to reconsider and allow me to showcase your work. Obviously, I'm a big fan and I know my top clients will be, too. You can reach me anytime on my cell. Ciao. [beep] [music playing] Hey, baby. What is my angel doing? CHRISTINE: Just working in the garden. I told you I'd get you a gardener to do that. It relaxes me. Ah, that sweet dulcet tone of your voice, that accent, like a dagger to my heart. And I know what relaxes you. I know but they'll be here in 10 minutes. All I need is nine. Ooh. Lucky me. Thank you. They're beautiful. Try the sauce. Mm. Oh, what a crock of shit. Really? No. It doesn't need more than a phase one environmental, Jack. A phase two will bog us down and skyrocket cost. Find a way. Look, I pulled a boatload of favors to get you on the EPA. It is time for you to scratch back. That's what I love to hear. That deal will pay for the wedding and the honeymoon. Help me get everything set. Oh, no salt for me. No salt? Do, do, do. Salt? - No. Thank you. Water is fine. You're not drinking? No. I make a mean Margarita. She just doesn't like the way it makes her feel. Exactly. You know me so well. Mm. - Mmmmm. So, have you picked a date yet? Yeah. Um. Help me, please. Help me. - June 10. - Yeah. June 10. Hey, then a toast. To what? To new beginnings. Great. And think not, you could direct the course of love, for love, if they find you worthy, will direct to your course. Hmm. Nah. June 10 is perfect. That way we get the family started in September. First born will be due about June. Perfect timing. Won't interfere with breaking ground in Phoenix. Wow. You've got that all figured out. Yeah. By the time I move in, upstairs will be renovated. There will be a gym with a hot tub, screening room, master bedroom. That sounds amazing. Well, it will be when he finally leaves. I thought that was part of the deal when you bought the place. It's a mess. We can't evict without proper cause. Well, my lawyers are working on it. Christine insists on playing nice. Victor is a golfing buddy. District Court Judge. I could have an injunction on his desk. The guy's out in 48 hours. Shh. Shh. Slow and steady wins the race. Time is money. Only fools rush in. Ah, but they get the best seats. Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do. Ha ha. Can you not do that thing that annoys me? What? Talk. Oh. [laughter] This is even better than La Serenta. I can't believe you did this. Thank you. Mm. Oh, it is fantastic. I should let you cook more often. Uh-huh. It's great. Really. Mm. Well I got the wrong margarita. This has salt in it. No. I didn't salt any of them. No. This is salty. Yeah. Mine too. Hmm. [plopping] [gasp] Mr. Westley. Mr. Westley. Mr. Westley. Oh. Get out here immediately. What? What happened? You horrible, disgusting man. What? Your clothes. You-- you-- you did this on purpose. Oh. No. No. I just thought that some fresh air would be good for the-- oh. Ah! [crash] Oh. That's just terrible. [shouts] Oh. Oh. Sorry. [music playing] [groaning] Ha ha ha. [music playing] [doorbell ringing] [music playing] Hello. I, uh, I came because I wanted to apologize for last night. I thought that putting my clothes out in the fresh air would help to dry them and-- I'm sorry. You want to give me a gift, move out. [door slams] [footsteps] [grunting] Miss Letellier. [knocking] Miss Letellier. That's enough. It was an accident. It was not an accident. OK, fine. It wasn't an accident and I didn't come here to apologize. I want my sneaker back. Oh. Your sneaker. You want your sneaker. Then I suggest you go check the dumpster. CLINT: I'm-- um, I'm sorry, too. Yeah. Thank you. [door slams] We didn't get the Meckler job. Good morning. Well, their ideas were primitive, no imagination. We have a reputation to uphold. A few minor details and we would have had that. The details in life are never minor my friend. Details are what make things unique. If they think they can design a better building, let them design it themselves. What are you eating? My cat. For breakfast? It's the only thing your principals can afford me. I'm spoiling you. My dog is in hiding until we book another job. You know it used to be the man's word meant something. People may have not liked you, but at least you got respect. Yeah, I always like the man to be smiling while he's sticking it to me. See, if we wanted to be corporate slaves, we'd go work for a-- We would be working at a corporation. --corporation. We wanted freedom. Sometimes freedom means saying no. Look, I know you don't like getting caught up in the numbers, amigo. But we really needed that account. We're behind on everything. Something else will come along. Sell my car. It's a lease. We're two months behind on that. You know you can save a little money if you want to move into the studio at my mom's. It's rent free. That's very nice of you but-- Thank you. Tell me, what kind of person is it that thinks they can just buy somebody out of their home. - I don't know. But if she gets it, you bet your ass I'm bidding on the design work. CHRISTINE: Oh, Jenny, I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed. Yeah, he's fine. He was up half the night brushing his teeth. Yeah. Yeah, me too. I really did. Soon, yeah. OK. I'll be there. Great. Love you, too. Bye. So how's my superstar doing. Wonderful. Good. Wedding plans going well? - Yeah. Great. Everything's great. Good. Well, Jonathan is a sage choice. Solid partner. I think the two of you are going to make quite the power couple. Hm. Thank you. We landed the city account. Really? They want us to plan and develop the entire plaza mall. The whole thing? Every square inch of it. I'm going to make it your baby. Oh. Oh, I'd be thrilled. You know, you pull this thing off, we're going to have to make you partner. No. Of course, I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled. Partner? This is your moment to shine. Grab it. I've never lost a deal and I don't plan on starting anytime soon. (WHISPERING) I know. Hm. [sigh] (WHISPERING) Internet. Internet. Oh. Hey, pops. Hey. Don't call me pops. It's cute. It makes me sound old. You are old. You better not be smoking again. I told you, I quit. Dad, Your nose is twitching. Uh, well it's probably Clint burning incense to calm his nerves. He makes caffeine nervous. We should drop ecstasy in his coffee. [beeping] Which is something that neither of us knows where to find, right. Whoa. Hypothetical. Huh. Cool phone. Finally trading in those carrier pigeons. It does everything. It's fantastic. And it even has a camera. Oh, Dad. Oh. (WHISPERING) There we go. OK. [camera clicks] [laughing] Maybe you can show me how to program it later. Saw that one coming. All right. I'm done here. Let's go. I got big plans. We can make dinner, movie. Kind of told Casey I would be staying at her house tonight. No. No. No. No. Your mother has you all the time. This is my weekend. You can see Casey some other time, all right. Daddy, plans. Well, I'm your father. I take priority. Right. Right. Good. No, uh, page two. Yeah. Give me the numbers. Oh, Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Call you back. Hey. You forgot. Forgot what? La Costa. The weekend. I used major connections to get that suite overlooking the water. Primo reservations. You forgot? I'm sorry. They've just handed me a huge account-- No. No. No. No. You're not doing this to me again. I've got a tee time tomorrow with Slater and Hodges. OK. I have to make a presentation on Monday. This is important to me. It's not really easy for me to get an entire weekend free, either. Sorry. Compromise. I'll work here tonight and we leave first thing in the morning. First thing? First thing. And I'll make it up to you. I name the terms. Meet you at home. Uh, no parking spots. Hm. Hm. [music playing] --got to be a bad guy. Why in the world would you be there-- Isn't this her spot. Not anymore. [music playing] You want your book bag? Um. [tires squealing] [honking] Move. What a pain in the ass. Move! You're in my space. You don't own the street. OK. You know this is my spot. Apparently not. [laughing] We win this one. - What a rebel. - Ha ha. Hey. [crash] Is she crazy? Big time. Whoa. - Hey. - Ah. [yelling] [squealing] You showed her. [music playing] How about the 17th. [ball rolling] No. No, Meryl. I-- it wasn't set in stone. I mean, yeah, the 17th is good. Actually, 17th is even better. That's great. That's fantastic. So is he locked? You're a goddess. J Train comes through again. Tom will definitely be at our wedding. Di-- Did you just move the date? He wasn't available on the 10th. He's my number one client. He's got to be at my wedding. He's a family guy. It's important he sees I'm a family guy, too. OK. Could you please do that outside? Yeah. I was thinking, since we're going to have two or three kids anyway, why wait. Start right after the honeymoon. Two or three? Yeah. One at a time, of course. Yeah. [clang] Of course. I got a surprise. Venice. Well I um, I hate it down there and I'm not hungry. Not Venice Beach, Venice, Italy, for our honeymoon. Oh. Yeah, sure. Sounds fine. Oh, don't get too enthusiastic. Ha. I'm working, huh. My, uh, my head is not in it. Well your head hasn't been in it for a while now. Can we not do this right now? Venice sounds great. Wonderful. OK? [tv channels changing] You're terrible. I'm telling mom. How is your mother? She's fine. Everything's fine. Pass me soy? What are you hiding. Nothing. Why? Because fine is a four letter word, when you use it-- Dad, stop being such a pain. Everything's-- everything's great. I just wanted to hang out with Casey tonight, that's all. Sorry I'm cramping your style. It's just that you're going to end up in there staring at one of your paintings, deciding whether or not to add a stroke that nobody but you is going to notice. That is your mother's negativity. That's not you. You say she's happy. She is. So things are good with her and Larry. Can't talk about it. What can't you talk about? Ugh, nothing. What? Is she afraid I might be jealous. Me? Jealous? Ha, ha, ha. [tv channels changing] Could you please turn that down? [tv playing] [click] [whistling] I got an idea. Why don't we move this party into the other room, I decided on the terms of my recompense. You know, if you want to leave tomorrow, I really need to get this done. Oh, taking a break's never a bad idea. Do I bother you when you're working? I'm bothering you now. Please, you know what I mean. You know, I'm going to bed. If you need me, it's in the bedroom. In case you've forgotten. [footsteps] (WHISPERING) That's the stupidest thing I ever heard in my life. Jealous. Jealous. She thinks I'm jealous What's up with your mother? I told you. Nothing. No. You said, I can't talk about it. Dad! [music playing] Look here. This one's for you. Here's the stroke that nobody will ever see. [laughing] [music playing] Mom and Larry are getting married. What? I wasn't supposed to tell you. What? Dad. They thought it would upset you, that you're too fragile fragile. Me? Who said that? Him or her? Dad I-- I knew it would upset you. Upset? Why would I be upset? Dad. Look, if they want to get married, that's fine. Why should I care. What d-- difference does it make to me? [doorbell ringing] Hey, Papa Jeff. You rock. You're the shits. [clap] - Hey, Al. Hey, Erin. I was going to tell you, but the whole thing with mom. It's OK. Have a nice time. [chatter] [MUSIC - ERIKA JAYNE, "JUST A PHASE"] Make a move. This ain't no story, boy. I'm smarter than I look. It's time to make my move and step away. And if I could I always would. But in the end your just a phase. And if I could I always would. [heavy bass] [meditation mantra] [clapping] [heavy bass] [groaning] [grunting] [heavy bass] Just ignore him. [heavy bass] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, you right there. [chatter] [music playing] Hey, you! [music playing] [explosion] Ah! I'm on fire. I'm on fire. I'm on fire. I'm on fire. Oh, my. Water. [gasp] [screaming] Oh. Sorry. Everybody out. Everybody out. Everybody out! [door slams] Ah. Ah. Give me that. Mm. Ah. [gasp] What? Is it bad? No. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Bye. Call me. Bye, bye. Call me. [laughing] In the future, I suggest waxing. Hair club for him awaits. [laughing] Come. Come. Come. [knocking] OK. Where's your father? - I'm sorry. I-- - Are you crazy? You nearly burned me to the ground. - It was an accident. - Yeah. I told you that stuff was dangerous. Sweetie, go inside. This is the last straw, Mr. Westley. You've pushed me too far. Now I have grounds to evict you. And I have grounds to call Homeland. Security Ha ha, like they'd respond to a psychotic arsonist. In the 17 years that I lived in this building, I never had trouble with anyone till you came along. I had a sweet, little, old man as a neighbor. Kind as could be. Everything was wonderful. Then why did he leave? Maybe he just wanted to get rid of you, just like everybody does. Everybody wants to be rid of you, even your wife, apparently. - Stop. You're going too far. Marrying a donkey would be a step up. Knock it off. I'm not a violent man, but you're pushing me to the edge. Oh, while you're there, do us all a favor and jump. Let me tell you something, I plan on living in this place till the day that I die. And even then, I'm going to come back and creep around and haunt it for all eternity. [door slams] [footsteps] What are you doing? I can't do this anymore. I cannot try any harder. I talk children, you barely listen. I surprise you with exotic getaways. It's all part of his big plan to drive us crazy. Then move in with me until he moves out. No. This is my home. I'm not leaving. It's a matter of principle. Where are you going? La Costa. [MUSIC - NICK STAI, "PANIC AND THE SHOULD ATTACKS"] I just want you to know, That no one's ever going to know-- I shouldn't have told you. It's late. You should go to bed. You still love Mom, don't you? She should've at least told me. [MUSIC - NICK STAI, "PANIC AND THE SHOULD ATTACKS"] So lay it down, now 'cause it's going to be the best thing for us both. Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight, Sweetie. [MUSIC - NICK STAI, "PANIC AND THE SHOULD ATTACKS"] If panic should attack. You turn your head you walk right back. If panic should attack, you turn your head. You walk right back. You walk right back. I'm coming. What are you, my mother? I said I'm coming. By all means, take your time. It's only the most important job on the docket. I got-- The people from Carlson are here. They've been here for 20 minutes. I have something important to do first. - Jeff, I can't do this alone. - Clint! Yeah. I believe in you. [busy tone beeping] - You OK? - Yes. Promise you won't tell mom I told you? Promise. I promise. Bye, Sweetie. Have a nice day. She said she already called. I did call. Five times. Mr. Westley. Mr. Westley. He's in with a patient. You can't go in there. Oh, that's not good. Here you go. Ah. Ah. Ah. Jeff, this is not the time or the place. - Why didn't you tell me? - I'm working here. Answer the question. You're out of control. Quite possibly. How did you find out? I'm connected. OK. Yes, we're getting married. - Grr. She didn't want to tell you. She was afraid of hurting you. Hurting me? Why would I care what you do? Why would I care that my ex best friend is marrying my ex-wife. - She thinks your fragile. - Fragile! Again with that word. Is that the word she used? Fragile? Yes. That's the word she used. She thinks you still love her and that you've suffered enough. That I still love her? A-- a-- And that's why you're still alone and that you hadn't found anybody new. Trust me. I'm doing fine. I'm doing fantastic. I've met a fantastic woman. So you can tell Mindy that I'm doing fine. Well that's great. Is it serious? - Serious? Oh, yeah. It's so serious I don't even know where to begin to tell you. It sounds like you're in love. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is. [whirring] Yeah. Well I'm happy for you. And know Mindy's going to be thrilled and relieved. When can we meet her? Invite me to the wedding. I'll bring her. Saturday, my place. Uh. Uh, don't tell Mindy I invited you. Grow a set, Larry. She was just afraid you were going to make a scene like when she'd left you. Enough all ready. Do I look unstable to you. [music playing] Uh-uh. Thank you. I'll see you Saturday. [music playing] [door slams] We lost it, again. It was a shitty job, anyway. - Yeah. They're all shitty to you. We need the work. Life's about more than money, Clint. Tell that to the bank, Jeff. Larry's marrying Mindy, Saturday. Ouch. No wonder your so upset. I'm not upset. Hey, I'd be upset if my wife remarried. You live with your mother. Is she getting remarried? I'd sell her on eBay if I could. [tapping] Is that-- Wilder, McKenzie and Bracket. The one you've wanted so no excuses. I submitted your initial proposal. They loved it. They have some changes. They want us to resubmit. We get this my dog comes out of hiding. I see. One door closes, another one opens. Hey. Ah. Hey. What happened? What happened is that his stubborn, mean spirited, aggressive, vindictive. First he ruined my dinner and then he lit my garden on fire. Jonathan lit your garden on fire? Who said anything about Jonathan? Who are you talking about? My upstairs neighbor. I think I'm-- I'm losing my mind. Thank you. Huh. What else is going on? I got into a fight with Jonathan. - About the neighbor? - Yeah. He's ruining my life. Now he wants me to get pregnant right away, so we have time for two or three. One by one, of course. - Your neighbor? Jonathan. I'm confused. Yeah, and that makes two of us. Do you want kids? I don't know. Well, I mean, you both have very busy and complicated lives. You've waited a long time to meet the right person. Jonathan, you know, may be a little controlling but-- No. No. No. Jonathan is not controlling. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, maybe, um, maybe you're just not used to someone else making decisions. You know? I mean you both seem so well suited to each other. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. We-- we really are meant for each other, huh? Everyone says so. You're such a good friend. Yeah, well, first things first, you know. We got to get this neighbor out of the picture. I'm trying. Well, fighting with him hasn't done anything, so you've got to find another tactic. Hi it's me. I'm sorry. You're still mad? Why would I be mad? I always wanted to look like Tammy Faye Bakker. CHRISTINE (ON PHONE): Ha ha. We'll fix it. I promise. You know, with maybe some brown makeup pencil. Yeah, maybe. You know, if you didn't live in that building, I would burn it to the ground. Why don't you just let me evict him, instead of having him ruin our lives? I have an idea. Trust me. I like that devious tone in your voice. Does it involve torture? [laughing] Yes. Oh, we are perfect for each other, aren't we? [music playing] [doorbell ringing] Hi. Should I call the bomb squad? No. I'm here to apologize. You're a painter? I paint. May I? Come in? Mm-hmm. Is this on of yours? Yes. I didn't know you were so talented. . I mean, I knew you were passionate. . Who are you? Open your gift. Hmm. I got the best ones. Well, these are fantastic. They're even the right size. - Uh-huh. I have a good memory. Would you like a glass of wine? No. Thank you. I don't drink alcohol. It's French. Yeah. That's very kind of you, but water if you have it. How's your boyfriend? Oh, uh, fiance. He's fine. A little crisp, but he'll be fine. Oh, thank you. Past is past. Uh, it's bad luck to toast with water. Oh, yeah. Right. So. So, what can I do for you? I was, uh, hoping that, uh, we could sit down like adults and, uh, discuss a reasonable solution. A solution. Well, federal contracts are binding in California and Mr. Martin is willing to testify. So, instead of wasting a lot of time and money, I thought that-- Lady, you're a real piece of work, you know that. Get out of my house. You will move out, one way or another. The only way you're getting me out of here is with an army. Then I'll get an army. And even then I'll fight to the death. This is my Alamo. You probably don't even know what the Alamo is. Of course I do. And it's not John Wayne's best movie. [door slams] [music playing] [thunk] [thunk] You wretched, obstinate man. [thunk] [music playing] Hey, Betty, listen. I need a date for my wife's wedding this Saturday, and-- no? Damn. Yeah, it's been a long time. How you been? You got married. Congratulations. [beeping] Twins. Really? How far along are you? It's Jeff. No. W-- Westley. Jeff Westley. What do you mean, I never call you back? I'm calling you back right now. Two years isn't that long. Hello? Are you coming with me or not, because I'm not taking no for an answer. [music playing] Hello, Evelyn. Yeah. How you doing? Doing all right. Listen, I need a date for my wife's wedding this Saturday. Well, so that I can prove that I'm not a desperate, pathetic loser. I need someone who's sexy and elegant, classy, smart, intelligent. Of course, I thought of you first. You're kidding. Wait, when would you know? You promise you'll call me right back? Thank you, Evelyn. [sigh] [laughing] [buzzing] [musical ring tone] Uh. Oh. Miss Letellier. Miss Letellier. Oh. Good. Do me a favor. Could you toss me that phone back up? It's an important call. Please. [music playing] [clapping] Come on. [beep] No. No. No. Don't answer it. - Shh. No. No! Ugh. Hello. Who? Oh, Jeff. Trust me. You don't want anything to do with him. I just caught him in bed with two women and a very, very, hairy man. Ugh. Oh. She hung up. Sorry. You have no idea how important that phone call was. Oh, really? Then call her back. [grunting] Ah. Ah. You did that on purpose. I didn't do anything. It was your fault, butterfingers. [grunting] Aye, aye, aye. [grunting] [ring] [ring] [ring] [ring] [ring] Hello? Evelyn. Yes. Yeah. No, no, no. That was my crazy neighbor. What would I be doing in bed with a hairy man? Hello? [beep] [groan] [sigh] [grunt] Ow. [music playing] [birds chirping] [phone ringing] CHRISTINE: Yeah. Hi. Yeah, I've got it here. Let's take it page by page. Page 20. Yeah. What number do you have. I see it in the deduction two. Great. And then? [music playing] [sniff] [doorbell ringing] [footsteps] Miss Letellier, it's your neighbor. Could you open the door? I need to speak to you. No, no, no, no. I'm not opening the door so you can further terrorize me. I need to ask you a favor. Could you just hear me out? I have to go to a wedding. And? Well, it's a special wedding. And, I-- I was wondering if you would accompany me. Are you high? - No. - Then take a taxi. No. No. I don't need a ride. I need a date. As pathetic as that sounds, I've called everybody I know and nobody is available. And you're my last hope. If you agree to come with me, as my fiancee, I'll move out. Me? Your fiancee? Not a chance. [door slams] [footsteps] I didn't think so. [music playing] [doorbell rings] OK. I'll go but you move out at the end of the month. Sign. - What's this? Our contract. This is business. I can trust you? Do you have any choice? Good. No. You get it after. Oh, now I'm trusting you. We leave in 10 minutes. OK. [door shuts] [music playing] OK. Ready? We'll miss the wedding. If we drive fast, we might make the reception. Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not riding in that. Come. I'm not a dog. [music playing] [engine starts] [music playing] OK. So, if we're going to pull this off, maybe we should get to know each other. What do you mean? Well, um, how long have we been together? Oh. Um, well, six months. Uh, did we have sex? I should hope so. Was it good? No. Can you imagine the two of us naked in bed together? [laughing] And, uh, does your painting pay the rent or do you have a day job? Uh, I don't sell my paintings. Really? No. I'm an architect. Oh. You've never showed? No. Hm. I'm sorry I burned your garden down. I've been wanting to start over anyway. How long were you married? 13 years. And, uh, how long have you been divorced? Look, we don't really need to talk about that. OK. How about you and, uh-- Jonathan? Yeah. We're getting married on, uh, June 10, I mean, um, 17. And then off to Venice, uh, Italy. And then we'll start having children right away. Yeah. We are thinking two or three. Sounds like you got it all planned out. What's wrong with that? Well, it's one way to do things. What are you implying? - I'm not implying anything. - Yeah. Yeah. Please. What are you trying to say? Well, it sounds more like a business plan than a romance. We have romance but you have to be practical, too. Right? Yes, of course. Jonathan is fantastically romantic. I'm sure he is. He loves me. And what do you know about romance? Huh? I don't see you in love. I'm not fighting you, Miss Letellier. I'm sure that you and Jonathan are going to live together, forever. You're perfect for each other. What are you doing? Get out. What? Get out. I knew it. You're going to kill me and dump my body where nobody can find it. You drive. Your ex-wife seeing me drive you to the wedding won't help you. You driving me will make you appear more virile, trust me. I take it you don't wear suits very often. Only when I paint. But it's a different kind of suit. [music playing] Ah, here we go. Are you expecting anyone else? I don't think so. Beautiful house. What does he do? He's a dentist. She left you for a dentist? This is getting better and better. (WHISPERING) Shut up. Shit. Why is he here? Did you tell him? No. You should really open the door for me. Good idea. Oh, thank you, Darling. Who's she? That's his neighbor. Well, they're holding hands and she's wearing a ring. She is? She's not that bad. [door slams] Oh. You OK? We are completely overdressed. Did it say casual attire on the invitation? I wouldn't know. Oh, great. This will be fun. She's too classy. She'll make him suffer. Come on. She's pregnant. You didn't know? Congratulations. - Congratulations. - On everything. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Oh, This is Christine. My, uh-- Yeah. I'm, uh, Jeff's fiancee. Ow. Why are you here? Oh, sorry we're late. The time was probably on the invitation that I never received. Jeff, please don't cause a scene. When have I ever made a scene. I'm Larry. This is my wife, Mindy. - Hello. I'm so pleased to meet you. Mm-hmm. And Ally, my daughter, whom you've already met. Well, thank you for inviting us. I mean, having us. I mean, everything is so beautiful. Thank you. Thank you, very much. Would you excuse me? I have to figure out where to seat you. She spent weeks on that stupid seating chart. Really? I'm so sorry. - No, no, no, no, no. There's always room for family. Get over here. Let's get some drinks. What are you doing here? You promised. Your new sadistic stepfather invited me And you brought her? She's your fiancee. Dad, what about everything that happened? All the things you said? She's a witch. She's evil. She's trying to throw me out. I'll explain it to you later, all right. You-- This is all a bit act. You-- you lied to me so I won't say anything to mom. You've been seeing her this whole time and you kept it from me. Ugh. [chatter] All right. I figured it out. You two are at table four. - Ah. Fantastic. Thank you. Yeah. Ah. Darling, would you like to dance? But, uh, I-- I don't dance. Oh, th-- that's right. She doesn't dance. Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. Pardon me. Excuse us. [music playing] Shh. It was an accident. [music playing] Cheers. No. Thank you. I don't drink. - Oh, come on. It's a party. No-- no drinking. No dancing. No fun. Ha ha. Yeah. Yeah. I know but no. Thanks. - OK. Jeff was right. You are gorgeous. Ah, Yeah but too late. You are married. And funny, too. He told you about me? Oh, sure. We're still friends. I mean, after all, dentists, we're like, uh, well we're-- we're like herpes. What? N-- n-- no. Uh, all I meant, uh, I mean, uh, all I mean is, uh, you keep us forever. Oh, OK. OK. Uh, here. Thank you. To you and Jeff. May you be as happy with him as I am with his wife. [music playing] Well you did a good job keeping that a secret. When were you going to tell me you were pregnant? I didn't want to upset you, Jeff. Why is everybody afraid of upsetting me? Because you're sensitive. - I'm not that sensitive. - Who is she? Who? Your fiancee. Oh. Oh. She's my fiancee. No. I know. You said that. Where did you meet? How long have you been together? We've been together for six months. Really? She's beautiful, isn't she. I-- as long as you're happy, Jeff. Totally happy. I'm totally happy that you're totally happy. I'm happy you're happy that I'm happy. OK. So you're happy. Nothing makes me happier than when you're happy. - Jeff's happy. - Ooh. - I'm happy that you're happy. - Ooh. Ooh I'm sorry. Oh. Oh. Whoops. - Oh. - What happened? I don't know. Oh, Yeah. It's my heel. Ally, can you get Christine a pair of shoes? No. Ally. Well, I'm not hungry at all but I think my baby is starving. Uh, really? Jeff, maybe just a little-- a little something? I'll get you something to eat. Thanks. [music playing] Oh. Oh. Thanks so much. Here you go. - Oh, No. Thank you. I don't drink alcohol. Please. Just a little sip. For me, so I can live vicariously. You know. OK. I cannot believe it. What? I-- You know, I-- I just never really thought Jeff would find anyone sane who could put up with him. What do you mean? You know, he's an idealist, a dreamer. Not a lot of people can live with a dreamer. I mean, the highs are high and the lows are just devastating. Don't you think? I mean, I'm completely shocked Clint hasn't killed him yet. I-- so much instability and grief. Well, I know, he's a handful but, uh, wonderful in his own special way. He's funny. He's charming, full of surprises. - Really? - Mm. Very full of surprises. Jeff? I have to tell you, Christine, I think you must bring that out in him. Ah, and then some. Well, cheers to the two of you. Yeah, cheers. OK. [clink] Mm. Mm. All right. Well, I'm-- I'm going to go get something to eat. It was nice talking to you, Christine. Have a good time. Mm-hmm. [music playing] [plop] [chatter] [footsteps] All I could find. Hmm. I'm not sure they go so well with my dress. If you'd rather suffer. No, no, no, no. Thank you. That's fine. I can't believe daddy brought you. After all he said about you. Mm. What did he say? He called you the wicked witch. Really? And now you're together. I should have seen it coming. He's always been weak to manipulative women. Ally, look, your father and I-- Save it. [door slams] [sigh] You think its going to ruin the shirt. Well, too bad your mother lives 3,000 miles away. It's stained, isn't it? Hey, thanks for coming to my wedding. Thanks for inviting me. I didn't. I know. You know you were never this romantic with me, wearing suits, holding hands. - People change. - People do. Yes. But you, no. 13 years, not once did you ever wear a suit. Well maybe if I had worn a suit, we'd still be married. Oh, but then you wouldn't be with Christine. Ha ha. Do I detect a hint of jealousy because I've replaced you? Of her? Are you kidding me? I mean, Jeff, really. Could you have picked anyone more uptight. Well you've got her all wrong. She's boring. - Boring? - My god. She doesn't drink. She doesn't dance. I'm sure in bed, it's, uh, hurry, hurry, I have to get up early. Wash my hair. Are you projecting? You're doing it again? Doing what? Setting yourself up for failure. It's what you do, Jeff. I mean, really, come on. You're a bohemian. She's a princess. She may seem a little cold when you first meet her, but once you get to know her-- You could freeze ice on her ass. Believe me, she's hot where it matters. Really? Yeah. Her? Yeah. I don't ask you about your sex life with Larry. Go right ahead. It's fantastic. Hm. Fantastic Go to hell. [music playing] [MUSIC - ZEBULON RAPHAEL, "JUST LET GO"] You make want to run away. Come be my queen for a day. Everybody's grooving. Everybody's down. I can't fight the feeling. We're blowing off this town. Let go. Getting up, getting out, trying something new. Ask me any question and the answer's me and you. Throw away your troubles baby no more feeling blue. Time to get in and get a clue. Just let go. Just let go. Let go. Just let go. [clapping] [chatter] Come see me tonight. It feels like the time is right. for a rendezvous. You said you didn't dance. Ah. Nice shoes. I know. They are really sexy. You know, you shouldn't have any regrets. About what? Your wife. She's much better suited to your dentist than you. Why do you say that? Because there is that, uh, extra something you can see between them. It's obvious they, uh, they belong together. How do you know that we didn't have that? You'd still be with her. And-- and you-- you-- you're so different. You know she-- she-- she can't understand you. Because you're-- you're really special. And, uh, you're very sweet. Ha, ha, ha. Yeah. And, uh, you're a very good dancer. Well, thank you. You know-- you know what would drive her absolutely crazy. What's that? If that, um, if right here, in front of these people, you kissed me. - You think so. Mm-hmm. [music playing] of your windblown hair and your special flair. You'll never know how good it can be, till you try. So be dreamy and come see me. Don't you hesitate. Just be dreamy and come see me tonight. Tonight. Tonight. Tonight. Come see me tonight. It's OK. [chatter] [car engine] Christine! Christine! Wait, wait, wait. Move. I'll run you over. You're overreacting. All this over a kiss? And you kissed me. I would never have kissed you. We were engaged half the day. What's a kiss? - OK. I'm counting till three. One. You can't leave me here. Two, - You can't, - Three. Whoa! [tires squealing] [music playing] [door opens] LARRY: Hey, Jeff! Hey, what happened? Is everything all right? Where's, uh, Christine? Oh. She had to leave. Emergency at work. She seemed so upset. She's fine. What kind of emergency? She didn't say. She just left you here? Yeah. It's complicated. Doesn't make any sense. Why does everything have to make sense? Does it make sense that we haven't found a better way to fix a cavity than drilling a hole in it? - OK. - It's medieval. - Sorry. It was just nice to see you so in love. Listen Ally was going to stay with Dottie while we're in Hawaii, and I was-- - Hawaii? Well Mindy always wanted to go, so I thought-- Yeah, I know. Would you mind taking Ally for the week, while were-- Why would I mind? She's my daughter. Hey, it was nice meeting Christine, you know. Everybody loved her. [music playing] [door shuts] [footsteps] What happened to you? Where have you been? Oh. Don't ask. Are you OK? Yeah. Bu-- why didn't you call? Because I-- I-- I forgot my cell phone. You forgot you-- Why are you all dressed up? What the hell are those? [sigh] Have you been drinking? No. I had to go to-- to an event for work and-- and, uh, I broke my heel and then I-- I-- I had to make that toast with a client and, uh, and I got dizzy. And, uh, and well, it was all so terrible. OK, OK, OK. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. I need to go to bed. [music playing] [doorbell ringing] [footsteps] Oh, hi. I mean, hello. Listen. Uh, before you slam the door, I just want to say thank you. Oh, and I brought your shoes. - Ah. Thank you. - Yeah. [laughing] Thank you. And this. For the kiss. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. No. You were right. It was me. You know, you make a hell of a fiancee. And you were right about the kiss. When they saw it, they couldn't believe it. And-- and I-- I-- I-- I never got a chance to tell you, you're a terrific dancer. [laughing] A--A-- and I want to say thank you so much for looking so beautiful and everybody loved you. [footsteps] [door slams] Would you care to revise your story? It's not what you think. You're misunderstanding. Misunderstanding? Oh. You don't answer your cell phone all day, which never happens. And then you show up home, haggard, drunk, wearing a man's shoes. Then he shows up with your shoes, flowers, thanking you for a wonderful day. And I'm supposed to believe that's a misunderstanding. Well at least I know why you won't evict him. How long has this been going on? Eh. Don't answer that. Jonathan, please, this is something I did for us. Ah, something I did for us. Who do you think you're talking to. I lie for a living. I'm the undisputed, heavyweight champion of liars. And what you're selling me is weak. Don't call me. [door slams] [knocking] I'm so sorry. I didn't-- Didn't what? Ruin my life? That's the only thing you seem to be good at. You-- you do nothing but cause trouble. Your cursed. Kindly give me my contract. I left it at Larry's, in my jacket. I knew I couldn't trust you. No, wait! Shit. [door slams] [music playing] Hey. Oh. Rough weekend? You have no idea. I totally screwed up this time. We were dancing, he kissed me, I slapped him. Why would you slap Johnson for kissing you. No. Not Jonathan. Jeff, my upstairs neighbor, and now he won't give me back my contract. What are you talking about? Yeah he signed a contract that he would move out if I acted as his fiancee. You agreed to sleep with him in order to get him to move out? No, of course not. You're killing me. He needed a date to go to his wife's wedding. I mean ex-wife. - And he asked you? - Yeah. He couldn't get anybody else. So we made a deal. And he kissed you? Yeah. I mean, no. Yeah, I guess we sort of kissed each other. And now Jonathan thinks that I've been having an affair and, uh-- Kissing another man when you're engaged is a big deal. I had been drinking. I was dizzy. You were drinking? You don't drink. What are you doing Drinking I know. Jenny, what should I do? Can you please call Jonathan to explain what happened? He doesn't want to talk to me anymore. I can't call Jonathan, sweetie. You have to talk to him. Tell him everything. But I think you first have to be honest about what you really want. [music playing] CHRISTINE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): I know it sounds crazy because it was. But I did it for us, so he'd out of our life for good and we could continue on with us, our plans. I'm sorry. I-- I should have told you. You should have given me the chance. We need to talk. I hope you'll call. It's settled. Sit back, and at the end of the month, if he's not out, then get the injunction. Have him booted and bury him in court. Save the favor with Victor. I'm not waiting. [beeping] I want this loser out, now. [knocking] Dad. Dad. Open the door. [knocking] [sigh] [beep] Hey. You OK? Yeah. Don't worry. I'll be finished in time. I know. [music playing] [knocking] What took you so long. I've been knocking and knocking. My dad's not home. I forgot my keys. He's not even answering his cell phone. Oh, I'm so hungry. I'm so hungry. Of course. Nothing in here. Is my dad here? Why would your father be here. Honestly, I have no idea what he sees in you. OK, look Ally. There's nothing between us. We're not engaged. We don't even like each other. We-- we had a deal. I saw the way Dad looked at you. I've only seen look at my mom like that, and that was a long time ago. Well, he must be a good actor. No. He's terrible. His nose twitches. He really went through all that just make Mom jealous? Yes. He must be so lonely. What dd you do to your nails. Oh. I was just trying t-- You didn't use an orange stick to push your cuticles back? A what? I guess I just never imagined my dad being with another woman. After the divorce, I didn't-- I didn't get to see him as much. But we were always kind of close than I was with my mom. He was always pretty cool about letting me do my own thing. He was never one of those uptight, controlling kind of dads. He was, uh, he was cool. I had him all to myself. I really-- I really just don't want to see him end up all alone. But I'm more worried about him settling for the wrong woman so he doesn't have to be alone, you know. Someone who doesn't appreciate him. Doesn't get him. Someone who will change him, you know. I think that's why he never put any of his paintings out there. He's just so afraid of being judged. He puts so much of himself into them. He takes criticism so personally. But then, how will anyone get to know the real him? Anyway, what's up with you Mr. Crispy Eyebrows? You two are getting married? You know, it's pretty late. Um, do you want me to make up the couch for you? Sure. Here you are. Thank you for my nails. And I really enjoyed getting to know you. Yeah, me too. Good night. Good night. [music playing] Sorry. I have to leave. Do you have anywhere to go? Uh, I don't-- I don't know. - OK. You can stay as long as you want, but please lock the door if you leave. OK. Do you have any money? Uh, no. I don't-- I don't think so. I left some if you need it. Thanks. Yeah, Nancy. No, I have it here. What time? [music playing] [beep] ANSWERING MACHINE: Monday 8:35 PM. ALLY (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Dad, where are you? I'm in your hall, on my cell, I forgot my keys. No idea what to do. Ugh. Call me, dork [doorbell ringing] Social Services is looking for you. I am so sorry. I-- I was working late at the office and I'm sorry. Uh. Where did you spend the night? Your fiancee's. She told me everything. I'm so sorry. I should have told you. It's OK. Oh, sweetie. She didn't try to lure you into a crackpot and eat you, did she? She's actually pretty cool. You're kidding. [doorbell ringing] Yes? You've been evicted, sir. Please step aside. Evicted? For what? Non-payment of rent. Get out of here. I pay my rent every month. Step aside, sir. Dad, what's going on? You can't do this. Look, sir, we can do this the easy way or the fun way, it's up to you. Forgive me? I was rash and silly and stupid and acting like a jealous child. But I'm here to say I'm sorry. I love you. And I promise you that all of our problems are solved. What do you mean? - Wha-- - What have you done? No. No. Don't touch those. Nope. I don't care what they say, nobody touches the paintings until they're properly packed. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. You horrible, two-faced witch. You were bullshitting me the entire time. No I wasn't. I--I-- I'm-- I'm really sorry. I-- I didn't do this. Here I was thinking that maybe, just maybe, there was a tiny little heart beating somewhere inside you, maybe even defrosting. To think that I actually kissed you. Ah, you admit it. Just leave. Go away. I'm sorry. You know, none of this would have happened if you had just agreed to move out like a normal human being. I take pride in not being a normal human being. Maybe if you had just given me the contract. It's in your mailbox. No, it's not. Would you please just leave. Look around, you've won. [music playing] I know you wanted to take care of it yourself. But now we can move on with our life How could you do this? Where's your heart? Humiliating him in front of his daughter. Heart? There's no room for heart in business, baby. There's-- winners and there's losers. All that matters is the net result. We got what we wanted. We're the winners. Just look outside. I did this for us. No. You did this for you just like everything you do. Everything is always about what you want. You know what, I've had enough. I want nothing to do with you anymore. - Don't be so emotional. - No. Get out! [door slams] [music playing] Dad, this is complete bullshit. We can tell the cops they lied. We can totally fight this. No. I'd just have to move out in a couple of weeks anyway. It's over. You're still going to honor that stupid agreement. It's important that we keep our word, baby doll. Where are we going to go? Have you ever met Clint's mom? At least we're together, Pops. We'll be fine. I should've taken that witch's money. [music playing] Oh, yes. These guys are fantastic. Their work is so vital, original, completely outside the box. Yeah, that proposal was the best by far and under budget. Well we love under budget. Mm-hmm. You're my champion. You always come through for me. Gentlemen. Nice to see you. - Hello. - How are you? - Very, very well. Nice to meet you. - Been looking forward to this. My pleasure. You. You gotta be kidding me. What's, uh, going on. Who's she? My neighbor. The witch. You guys know each other. - We were engaged. - What? - What? - Really For one day. - For one day too many. - OK. Jeff, please. Let's be reasonable. This is business. Reasonable, with you, not a chance. A-- All right. What's happening here? What's happening is, I will not do business with her kind. Mr. Westley, this is a huge account. Certainly we can separate personal matters from business. My business is personal and I will not work with her. - You can't just pass this up. - Oh, yeah. Watch me Jeff, please. This is good for all of us. Do not speak to me. He's willing to give up a multi-million dollar contract over a personal matter? I will bring him right back in here. Please. No one move Come on. Come on. Let's go back inside. What are you doing? Come on. Hey. You-- you're not-- n-- Listen. This is it. If you do not come back in right now, we are through. - You want to go in there-- - I'll take it myself. - You go in there. - Fine. [crash] [crashing] [footsteps] You're such a freak. [crash] What do you think you're doing huh? Listen. Calm down. Calm down, right now. Please. Please. I's begging you. Let's go back inside. Come on. I wish I had a mirror so you can see yourself. A mirror? What are you talking about? [yelling] [MUSIC - NICK STAI, "THE SONG OF SHINE AND SHAME"] right back to the place you tried so hard to leave. If you don't really mean what you say, then why should this make the skin go away? There's no need to shout. No one here's going to doubt you again. So fix, fix your eyes on the sun, on the sky, on the ceiling in your room, and all the shame that shines on through. And oh, my God, I'm sweating it out again. And I've been taking it out on you. Summer's here and its closing in. Your lips are closing in on me. I just don't think I'll ever make you see. [beep beep] Whoa. Hey. Whoa, whoa. Hey. It's only four. You guys weren't supposed to be here till six. I haven't packed my paintings yet. Buddy, we were told to be done by 4:00. By who? By the lady. [music playing] [doorbell ringing] [footsteps] - Hi. - Oh. Hello. I saw you were starting a new garden, so I-- Yes, a fresh start. That's always a good idea. They're for you. Oh. You're not going to slam the door. I don't know. Take a chance. Thank you. You're welcome. It's a bit much for a few weeks. You can stay longer, you know. Longer? Mm-hmm. As long as you'd like. What about your renovations? I no longer need the extra space. [music playing] Would you like a glass of wine. You don't drink. One glass won't kill me. Well, look what happened last time. Was it really so bad? Well, it caused a lot of problems. And, uh, solved some too. You know, we never did get off on the right foot. No. We didn't. I'm Jeff. I live upstairs. Nice to meet you, Jeff. I'm Christine. Christine. Your neighbor. [music playing] [clink] [music playing]
