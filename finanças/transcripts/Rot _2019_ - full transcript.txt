Oh, there's not. What? What's going on? Hello? Hello? Katherine? No. How did you get down here? Did someone help you down here? Who, another nurse? Okay, relax. He was in here. So I was never lonely. Okay. Let's get you back to your floor. There's something wrong with her. - There! - Calm down! I just need to get Katherine back to her floor. He says, "I have to go". Yes, it's time to go. Katherine? Good morning, sunshine! Why is it a good morning? Because we all woke up. - Okay, today we will have - Jesse, Jesse, hold up. - Bingo in the lobby- - Got somethin' for ya. - Oh. - Thanks. Here you go, man. Dr. Carter will be seeing patients - from three to five- - Hi, good morning. - Hi, good morning. - I'm David. - Hey. - I'm still here to - Okay. - Oh, - tonight's the night, right? - Did you get a - visitor's badge yet? - Think she'll be surprised? Okay, so go ahead, - take that, - Hope so. Put that on, and the elevators are down to your left. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Have a wonderful day. I don't see my overtime on here from last week. I'm not payroll. Call the number at the bottom, man. You'll have a high of 59 degrees, with temperatures dropping rapidly towards the 60s. Showers and thunderstorms expect to continue into tomorrow morning. The overnight low near 38. - Rain tapering off- - Good morning, Rose. Just stay there. Yeah, we're getting help, okay? She signaled for assistance at 2:36 am, which was manually cleared. So where's the incident report? It was quiet. There were no incidents. Said that Katherine kissed her. Everybody who needs to email me, don't forget to do that before the end of today. If you haven't done it, you're not going to get those grades. One final thing we need to deal with, is the fact that so many of you have complained about how difficult last week's test was, which was very surprising since I did go through everything with the class before. That is not true! Thank you, Grace. Fortunately, for you, Madison here has convinced me to grade on a curve, something I usually abhor doing. One day, she'll learn not to be quite so nice. Are you with us Madison? You seem to be juggling too much. I haven't dropped anything yet. Will you have those essays ready for us - Of course. - by Friday? Good. Shake it off, he can be difficult sometimes. The questions on that quiz were things he never even taught us. Heading this way? It's not clicking. What do you mean? You're supposed to be trying different classes, and then see what you like. I actually didn't even know what Applied Behavior Analysis was 'till I shadowed. I just feel like getting a degree in psychology is signing up to be miserable in grad school. Do I look miserable to you? Well, you know, it looks like my insomnia is going to the thing that takes me down. 40 hours spent here, yeah, another 20 working at the bar, plus the lab, and tutoring, I finally caved. I got a prescription for Ambien. What did you say to get that? You can just ask the Student Health Center. Yeah. It's pretty liberal around here. Anyone else? Well, Madison and I are waiting to hear back if we got into the last round of Mason-Mack. - No shit? - Mm-hmm. And now I wake up every morning nauseous from stress. Honestly, I don't know. I kinda hope you just get it, 'cause I don't know how much more of this - I can really take. - No, I'm not gonna get it. I am too preoccupied grading shitty undergrad essays. Sorry, I'm sure yours is great. It got so bad the other day that I had to break up with my boyfriend. Yeah. I mean, look, Mike just didn't understand, you know? He has always wanted us to go out, and have fun with his friends. I mean, I would encourage him to go, but then it's like he would, and I'd be mad because I wasn't there. But it's just always something. It's always school, or work, or study group, and I don't know, something had to go. Shit. Hey. So sorry about - rushing past before. - Hey. I'm Jesse. Nora, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you to. Hey, dude, remember my party's Friday, right? Oh, yeah, of course. You won't be able to get rid of me. Wait, what happened here? Huh? Oh, we just ate some food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but there's like five bowls here. Every meal required multiple bowls? Oh, I may have had something to do with that, sorry. No, you're fine. Pause the game. - Yo! - Pause the game, you cheater. It's supposed to be my night. I'm sorry, we just kinda ended up back here, you know? We had some food, and came back. Oh, shit, is that tonight? Yeah. Dude, I'm sorry. - Yeah, yeah- - Can you help me? - Yes. - I can help. - No, oh no. - That's okay, we got it. - We got it. - What's going on? We got it, thank you. - He's gonna propose tonight. - Thank you. - Oh shit. - Sorry. - Here. - Don't say anything. Okay, I won't say anything. - Do you need plates? - Thank you, thank you. No, we got this. - Okay. - Can we get this all cleaned up before she gets here? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. Okay. I'd probably do a better job. So she is just using me to make her ex jealous, right? - Oh, definitely. - Yeah. I got the whole workout routine planned and everything. - Yeah. - I'm finally gonna turn my shit around, you know? I bought bananas today. Healthy food. Sure, okay. - Hey! - Hey. - Hey! - Hi. Hi. What are you doing here so early? Oh, Chrissy was giving me a headache. Oh, I need a hug. Bring it in. That bad, huh? Let it out. Mmm, crack my back. In and out! All right, you got one, I think. Yeah, thank you. Hey, you look nice. Hey. Why do you look so nice? What do you mean? You know why. No, I thought dinner was tomorrow. Sorry. It's okay. It's okay, just sit down and relax. I haven't even started dinner yet. I just inhaled a burrito. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Can I... You look so nice. Oh my god, you got candles. Can I help with anything? It's okay. I'm sorry. Let me just go change. Okay. Please. I can't. I'm too weak to carry you. But I will find you legs. And eyes to see. And they'll know you've come. Mmm, soupy. That's the recipe. Are you still chopping over there? Yeah. No, what? It's seasoning. - It's good. - Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hi. What do you need? Can you just boil some water for me? Look who came out of hibernation. I don't wanna be adult anymore. How much do you have left? A couple more hours. Kirk's getting on me to finish these essays. Oh, Kirk. The professor. I know, I just didn't realize we were calling him Kirk now. Oh, would Professor Henley put your insecure mind at ease? Yeah. Hi. Do we need to take care of this guy? This guy seems my girlfriend more than I do. Babe, what is it? What is it? Oh my god, I made it to the final round! - The Mason-Mack? - Yes, - the final round! - The Mason-Mack? Oh my god! - Yes! - Congrats, Maddy. Oh my god, I've been working on this for months. - It's this- - Ah! Oh, sorry, Kirk is... - Professor Henley- - Oh! What? She gets like a mentor, lab time, extra money for her thesis. Oh. It's kind of a big deal if she ends up getting it, so. That's awesome. So what, is Aaron dating that girl? Don't know. How was work? The same. Jesse, you know you can just quit anytime you want. You could go back to school to pick up photography. You can do wedding photography, if you want to. You know I don't give a shit about work. What? I'm sorry you're very naked, and very angry. What are you talking about? You should tell Aaron to get her flowers. Have you met Aaron? Romance isn't exactly his first language. And that's what makes it all the more special when you do it. What are you trying to imply? Stop it. Stop. Huh? Stop it. But you're the love of my life. I love you too. Maddy? I have to get back to work. Hey, hey. Maddy, put the pen down. Go on. Go on. I don't know what to do, and it's not getting any easier. Hey! Hey, we're okay. I mean, as long as I can pay rent, and eat, and you're still here ignoring me. This is the only thing that matters. I'm not worried about you getting the grant, - because I know that- - Yeah, because this is the only thing that matters? The fuck, Jesse? How can you fucking say that? Sorry that what I want doesn't directly benefit you, but you are not the most important thing to me right now, okay? Let's not- Hold on! - A little help. - Hold on. That's not exactly what I'm saying at all, okay? What I'm saying, is- Yo, hey. Are you going to my party Friday night? Of course, the big three-oh. Cool. Does Jesse have any condoms? - I got it. - Yeah. I got it. Lookin' sexy, buddy. Thank you. Miss? Miss, I understand. Rose? Rose? Miss? You okay? This is the fourth time you've called today. Hey, Jesse? I need you to check in on Rose for me, please. I'm doing my monthly vitals. Have Taylor take over for you. - Come on. - We're just a little bit backed up. All right, Miss, we'll send someone right over. As soon as we can, we'll send 'em right over. Heads up, she's been a little bit off since the incident. She doesn't faith have in anything anymore. Cops are the enemy. - Rose? - Our spiritual leaders ignored. You kidding me? No wonder we need our - safe spaces. - Rose? - Oh, hello, sweetie. - Oh, I'm triggered by that. Good. Did you accidentally hit your call button? No. We're so worried about offending people, we forget that God is the one that determines what is offensive, How do you feel? and what is morally wrong. Wonderful. Throughout history, God has looked down - at his creation- - Threw some kind - of party in here? - Unworthy of salvation. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - I pray deep in my heart. He's quite the messy, little guy. I'll help you. - Here. - I'll do it. - No. - I'll do it. Backslide any further. The time has come for real God fearing Americans to stand up and say, "Enough is enough". And I know some of you out there know what I'm talkin' about. Let me find you something a little less angry to watch. - A long time to take up arms- - Everybody's angry. - Today's bombing at the- - You're angry. No, actually, I'm not angry. You're pathetic over a selfish bitch. What? What'd you say? You have needs that need to be fulfilled, and she's not doing it. She claims she doesn't want it, but she does. Stop it! - You need to make her pay. - Stop it! You need - Shut up, Rose. - to make her pay. - You need to make her scream. - Shut up! - Shut the fuck up! - You need to make- - Shit. I'm sorry, okay? He was... He made me feel things that I haven't felt in a very, very long time. I've been carrying him inside me, and soon he's going to leave, and I'm going to be left all alone. - And I- - Nurse, can we get someone to- Rose? Rose? Hey. Hey, it's me. Come on, pick up, you fucking cunt. Look, I know I messed up. Please call me back. Please, please call me back. Call me back. Pick up you fucking cunt, or I'll drive to your apartment, and I will kick in your fucking door. Now, listen, the interview you've got tomorrow with the Selection Committee from the Mason-Mack people, it's at the same time as my class. So can you drop off those essays before you go? Yes, I will have them tomorrow. Good. How long do you think it'll be? I don't know, an hour, maybe two. Look, just prepared, all right? They're gonna grill you, and they're gonna want to see your whole thesis presentation. Okay. Now, listen, I know we've spoken - about this before, - Kirk. but I don't think I got through to you, so just hear me out. I get it. You don't wanna follow the herd, but there's a reason everyone is focusing on Autism right now. That's where the money is. So children without disabilities, they don't need help? No, that's not what I'm saying. We can't determine where the corporate interests lie. They're going to be choosing between you, and one other woman. My friend, Vicky. And they are gonna go with the person who elicits the most interest from the investors. Do you need to get that? Is that important? No, it's just... No. Madison, if you don't get this grant, that's it. There's no funding for your thesis. So do yourself a favor, turn off the phone, and focus. Okay. She's not your friend, at least not until this is over. Sorry I'm late. It's fine. They're all terrorists. Nuke 'em! How many more Americans have to die before we realize- - I don't wanna be depressed. Did you tell dad about the grant? No, I'll tell him if I get it, but I don't know yet. You know he's selling the house? It'll be so weird not to go back there, and have our rooms, and spend holidays there. - I think it'll be super weird. - Yeah, but it was kinda too big for just him, don't you think? But it will be weird. Okay, you wanna talk about it? About what? It's just a break. For how long? A while. He wanted me to move in. Where would I live? Can you not indicate you're at least somehow happy that this happened? Like I don't think it's necessarily - a bad thing you guys broke up. - No, I feel pretty shitty about it, okay? Well, it's not some kinda defeat if you - Chrissy! - break up with - your boyfriend. - Stop! You deserve better, okay? That's the last I'll say about it. Hello? Hey, Jesse. What are you doing? - Aren't you at work? - Can we talk? Now? No, I have a lot of stuff - to prep for tomorrow. - What did I do? Why... - What did I do, huh? - Ow! Why aren't you answering my calls? - Ow! - Why are you ignoring me? Jesse. That hurts, let go of me. I'm sorry. Hey. I'm sorry. Hey, let's go. Get some sleep, you'll feel better tomorrow. No, no, no, no, no, no, I need this. She knows. I need... Jesse. Jesse? What's wrong with me? I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know what's wrong with me. You selfish bitch. He's lucky I didn't kick his ass when he grabbed you like that. Ready? All better, you see? That wasn't cheating. It was on like its side, and I had to shake it, and I think that was legit. - So I'm gettin' a sheep. - Okay, I'm getting war. - Okay, great. - Okay. - Your turn. - Give me the dice. Your turn, chill. I just rolled the dice. That's how we play the game, okay? Okay. Seven. - Oh, hey! - Robert, what are you gonna do? Choose wisely. Do it. Yeah! - ♪ Da nah ♪ - You already stole from me last round, you know that? I did? Oh, this game's like real life, man. You know, we screw each other over just to build bigger cities. Dude, what are you talking about? Please don't start with that again. He's gonna go down a rabbit hole. Don't start with that. I'm just sayin', you know? We mine the Earth for precious resources. Frank, Frank, - we don't care. - I'm getting a beer. - Whatever. - We agreed, no alliances. Delicious tear. Mmm, sorry. What, are you using the fridge as air conditioning? You okay? Ho, ho, ho! The hammer is swinging back, baby. Please come here so you can see how you're gonna lose. Wanna smoke? Not today, my friend. - I'm getting my shit together. - Are these for me? Yeah. Just saw 'em at the store, thought you might've liked 'em. This is supposed to be a date? Frank was goin' through some shit, so I invited him over. Aw. Kinda got my heart ripped out. His girlfriend - cheated on him. - Oh. Okay. Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man. Hey, calm down. My sister's had these before. Move it all the way out the way, yeah. We've gotta shove somethin' - in his mouth. - No, don't, don't touch him. Oh, he could choke! Jesse, you're okay. Has this happened before, Aaron? - Aaron! - Huh? Has this happened? No, no, I'd think I'd fucking remember it. Okay, well, we can shove this in his mouth- - I know what the fuck I'm talking about! - Jesse, can you hear me dude? - Watch his head. Nothing in his pockets, check his pockets. Okay, we need to make sure the clothing is loose. Here, roll him on his side. Okay, okay. Use your finger to clear the mouth of any obstructions. Put your finger in there, come on clear. Why me? - There's room. - He could choke- Be careful though. Okay. Dude, do it quick, I don't need... Get your finger out. Watch his head. Jesse? We're here, okay? You had a seizure. Hey, bud. You scared us man. Any day now, Maddy. If you're not careful, they're going to give the grant to somebody who's actually ready. Yeah, and I'm gonna change my thesis to family dynamics, fostering the annoying habits of younger sisters. Okay, I could write - an entire essay- - All right, all right! Let me focus, shut up. Behavioral- Give me your phone. It's Aaron. Hey, Aaron. What happened? No, no, no, slow down. How long did that last? No, it's fine, I'll just come there now. You're just making this harder on both of you. Jesse had a seizure. I'll be right back, I promise. I'll call you. What the hell were you guys doing? My head hurts. You hit the ground pretty hard. You have any Advil? Yeah, yeah, I think he's got a first aid kit. Oh, shit. Jesse, you need to keep your head down. How was the proposal? She cry? It's not happening. - Oh, damn that sucks. - What? - Jesse, you need to lie down. - Dude, what happened? - Jesse, I really need you to- - I'm fine! Okay, just go get something for his head, I'll clean this up. Jesse, calm down okay. I don't want you to hurt yourself more. Jesse, Jesse sit down. Ow- - Hey! - Aaron! Aaron, get back here! Jesse, please stop! - Get him off me! - What are you doing? Get him off! What did he do? Stop, hold him down! Calm down! - God, get him off! - Jesse! Jesse! Okay. You okay? Oh my god! Okay, okay. Fuck! - Okay? - Yeah. Jesus. You okay? Yes. Fuck! Oh my god. Stay here, okay? Be right back, just stay here. What? Fuck, don't leave, Aaron! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse! Hey, shut the fuck up! Jesse. Jesse. Jesse. Hey where's Jesse? Oh my god! What happened? Wait, let me see. Oh my god, are you- Jesse! Jesse! Jesse. Hey, man. Hey man, can I help you? Good, one, two, three. Yes! Shit. What's goin' on dude? You don't look so good. Hey man, sorry dude, I'm not... What the fuck? Dude, what the fuck? I'm trying to help... Get off! Get off of me! No, no, we haven't heard from him this morning. Yeah, we're starting to get worried too. Uh-uh, right, I gotta go. Reach out if you hear anything, though. Thanks for letting us know, though. Anything wrong? I guess Jesse's not coming into work today. Hold on, Mike If I don't respond immediately she starts freaking out. You might be the next one to spontaneously disappear. Go back to studying, Madison. Oh my gosh. Is she not looking for him? Where would she look? Are you kidding me? She has an important interview for her thesis today - Yeah, but- - that she should be studying for. It's her boyfriend, and he's missing, - so she should be helping look. - My ex. Ex boyfriend. That was just like a day ago. Fuck you! Yeah, did anyone come in under that name? - Hey, Madison! - What about without IDs? Madison! - Oh, sorry. - Uh-huh. No, I'll call back in a few hours. Thanks. Hey! Oh my god, I'm so glad it's you. Hey, what's wrong? Oh, is it the interview? 'Cause I just had mine. - Honestly, it's not that bad. - No, it's not the interview. Oh. Did you see my Facebook post? No. Jesse's missing. No, what do you mean he's missing? Is he okay? He wouldn't be missing if I knew that. Okay, so what do we need to do? Do we call his parents? - Do we call the police, or- - No. - What do we- - I'm just gonna prepare - for the interview, and just- - Hey, hold on. Let's just... Let's go talk. We'll just... We'll postpone the interview. - This is more important. - No. I have to go to the interview. That's not even an option. Aaron, I'm sure you're out looking for him, but I'm gonna help after my interview, I promise. You know, and hopefully he shows up before then. And I'm about to lose reception, 'cause I'm heading into the library, so I'll check my messages when I get out. Okay. Aaron, I'm sure you're out looking for Jesse. Can you please swing by my place, and check on my sister? I haven't heard from her, and I'd appreciate it. And I'm about to lose reception, 'cause I'm heading into the library, so I'll check my messages. Thank you. Jesus. Maddy, it's Aaron. I just got back to the apartment, and Jesse's car's gone, apparently. So that's weird. We took out his keys last night, and they should still be in the apartment. I'll call you back. Tom? It was freaky. My foot still hurts. I can't put all my weight on it. Oh my god. So inappropriate. Yes, the safest of sex. No, I don't. No. I don't think he's had a girlfriend in a while. He's kind of fumbling around a little bit. Speaking of, he's calling me now. No, you will not be meeting him. I'm over it. Oriana? I'm there at work, hold on. Yes, I'm being careful. Hold on. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Oriana? I know, no. So how's dad? Goddamn it. Yeah, no, I'm still listening. Bridge, very exciting. Congrats. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I have to go. Yeah, love you too. Okay, bye. You're talking to my landlord! Hey! Hey, kid, what are you doing here? Get out of my house! Ow. Ow. Ow. I don't wanna break the 20. - Oh, well, too bad. - You know- - What a life you have. - Oh geez- Hey. Oh, bro, shit, sorry. It's Aaron. We've met before. - Jesse's roommate. - Yeah, we have. Hey, your sister wanted me to come by and check on you, - just make sure you're okay. - Oh. Can I come in? I guess. I just texted her. You know, this is so unnecessary. How long have you been here today? Hours. You know they broke up? Yeah, I know it really sucks. What's your hammer for? It's just in case. Oh. Spooky! Well, at least you're not the third wheel anymore, right? Oh, I'm datin' someone now. Oh, congratulations. Yeah, we're just gettin' pretty serious. Cool. What's with the bruise? It was an accident. Fell. Okay. Are you coming over tonight? I can't. It's my 30th birthday party. If you're not doing anything, you should come by, and bring some friends. Well, people are coming here to look for Jesse. Tonight? Yeah. Shit. I should be here for that, right? Kinda. Here. Thanks. So what's everyone's deal? Like this can't all be because of the break up. I mean, has Jesse never been broken up with before? It's not that simple. I mean, he was gonna propose to her. No, don't say anything about that. I don't think Maddy even knew, but that would explain why. Yeah. Don't freak out if your new girl breaks up with you. She has been ghostin' me. You think that's what it is? No, I don't know her like that, so. I mean, she left last night without saying anything, and now she's not returning any of my texts. You did leave her bleeding all over the place. No I didn't! I helped her. - Okay, Jesse lost his shit. - Okay! He went fuckin' nuts. - What do you want me to do? - Okay. Jesse's not like dangerous or anything, right? I think I'm gonna go check on her. Right now? Why don't you stay? We could hang out. Wait! Is this for real? Just lock your doors, okay? Hello? Come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Shit. Is he coming? He should be here. He was supposed to meet me before class, - and he never showed up. - Yeah, I was supposed to be at an interview, so I'm not really sure. Sorry, seems like Professor Henley is running behind today, so we can just pick up where we were last week while I give him a call. Everyone, open up your books. Okay, so we talked about social effects, and how they affected our social structures, and how they affected our development. Okay, the effects that are... Okay. Sorry, I'm supposed to be in a presentation right now. Okay, so we'll start with relationships then. Fuck. Relationships. My dad, for instance, a man of the Midwest, he's not a big emotional guy, so his coping mechanisms would be cooking. So when dinner would be fancy on a Tuesday night, me and my sister knew what was up. If we just ignore the things we're going through... Madison? Okay, sorry. What the fuck am I doing? I need to go. Your essays are at the front. I'm sorry, guys. Nora? Joan? Nora? You home? Wow, you definitely have a type. Over your ex, huh? Yeah. Is someone there? Hello? Hello? Oh my god! You scared the shit out of me. Hi. No, sorry, sorry, not you, just... Were you there the whole time? Didn't you hear me call your name? Sorry, no. Yeah, we still haven't found him. We're still lookin', just like everyone. Is there an alternate number that I can reach him at? He never left an emergency contact. Hold up, he just walked in. Wait, what? Hello, hello? Jesse just showed up at work. Just in time. I'll tell Madison, so you can get ready for your party. We wouldn't want you to miss your big day. I could come help look. No, no, no, all his friends are here. It's fine. - We'll be fine. - It's not a big deal. I just have to park. I do feel really selfish, like I wasted his time. But when he disappeared, I wasn't worried or scared. I was pissed. Associating from your feelings is a really easy way of dealing with them. Are you diagnosing me? Yeah. You're not a bad person. Just gotta put yourself back together. Okay, thank you, Grace. Come on! Drink, drink! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Do we even know who the last person was who saw him? I think his roommate. So how do you guys know Jesse? We went to college together. I was his roommate - freshmen year. - Oh, cool. All I know is I can't stay here all night. - I'm not supposed to be... - Nothing substantial. Hey. Hey. I'm here. Hey, thank you for coming. I'm sorry, I can't even imagine. So what happened? All right, you guys read my posts, so. Well, by the time that I got to his apartment, Jesse and Aaron were both gone, and Nora was bleeding all over the place. And so who's Nora? - Hey, birthday boy! - Hey! How are you? Good, how are you? I'm great. Happy birthday. - Thank you. - It looks great in here. - Thanks for comin'. - Hell yeah. Are you coming to dance? A little bit later. - Are you sure? - Yeah. This is a good song. Let me get some more beer in me. I'll meet you out there, okay? All right, I'll see you. Happy birthday! - Hey! - Hey! Who the hell are all these people? No clue, dude. Do you wanna battle? Hi. Hey. Every second that he's out on the street - is a second that we've lost! - Calm down. - Everybody calm down. - We're all worried about your friend. We're all here for the same fucking reason. He left and he came back? I don't know, and left again? Look, he's not gonna get in his car, and take off, - No. - and not tell anybody. I mean, maybe there was something - like a family- - So that means he's lucid. If he has his car, what are the chances of finding him? Like did something emotional happen? Like sometimes people, they faint, they seize when something really big - emotionally happens. - I know, something at work? 'Cause I know he fuckin' hated work. What happened? We broke up recently. Oh, okay. So that's... Oh, shit. Oh, babe, babe, babe. He was gonna? - Taylor! - Gonna what? What? What? Spit it out, dude. He was looking at rings, and - he was gonna... - Oh my god. - He was lookin' at rings. - All right. - I'm sorry. - Take a breath. Excuse me. There's your answer. I mean, slightly, but it doesn't - explain why- - It doesn't - explain the seizure. - The guy's distraught! Hello? Can I help you? You're all gonna give in. If you don't let me, I'm gonna hurt you. The world is for him. I'm just tryin' to figure out our plans. Alex, just stop. - It's not, but it's relatively- - But it doesn't make sense - why he's not texting back- - He just needs- - Hey, I still care about Jesse, so can we make a plan? - Alex, you were right. - I don't care if he's just pissed, or with another girl to get back at me, but I still care about him. So can you please? I'm just asking asking for a little bit of help. - Absolutely. - Yes, yes. Have you called hospitals? Yeah, I checked hospitals. - I called the police. - She checked the - fucking hospitals. - I posted online. I've done everything I'm supposed to do! Okay, well, we can drive around. - We can look for him. - Yes. Where would he- Before anybody goes anywhere, let's make some routes. Where would you- In the interest of time, probably just blasting everybody's friends and family on social media is going to save - a lot of time. - Do you wanna write- - Sorry, do you have a printer that we could use? - Yeah. - Thank you. What if we try- Okay, well then, fine. What do you want me to do? I want everyone on the road - in 10 minutes. - Taylor, Taylor. - Taylor. - Let's just get goin'. Yeah. - 10 minutes. - Go. I'll wait on you. Do either of y'all have a light? Yes. I forwarded to you the message, so if you can take that, and CC your contact list? We can't put something like that. I mean, it looks like no one's gonna wanna call. - I feel like- - You can't spell, first of all. Listen, if you do hear anything, please me a call, okay? And then we'll figure it out. - Two minutes long- - Wait, you and her, - Rachel and Alex- - Paige. I think... Look, I'm sorry. It's fine. Don't worry about it, it's fine. What? Where? Okay, thanks, bye. Our co-worker, Steve, thinks he found Jesse's car. Where? Sierra, downtown, like 20 minutes ago. Okay, so this changes our journey. Where Paige at? - My car can leave now. - She's upstairs havin' a smoke. Fuck, yes! I told you we'd find him. The corner of Hendrix and Sierra. Aaron's party's around there. That must be where he's going. Okay, yep. No, we're turning around now. Yeah, we'll call you when we find him. Paige? Excuse me, have you seen somebody smoking up here? No, just me. Great. I hope you're not disappointed. No, no, I'm just looking for a friend. Right. Hey, whoa. What are you doin'? Nothing. Hey! Doing what? Okay, great. Yeah. I would love it - if you could share the post. - Thanks so much. And if you're not - doing anything- - Yeah, no, totally. I will 100% let you know if we find him. Yeah, yeah, I think I'm free. Right, cool. All right, later. - Yeah, no, that's- - Hey. You know that Taylor was looking for you on the roof? Oh, shit, sorry. I left my phone in the car, or my phone charger. I need you. Hang out just a sec. What the fuck is this? - I know. - Yeah. I'm trying to fix it right now. I had a seizure, - and my car is also missing? - Has anyone seen my bag? And then... I didn't know you brought one in. I'm actually ready to go, if you are. So am I. - It's not gonna - Okay, cool. - make any sense - You know what? - if we're all circling - Can you guys still just- the same spot. He's nowhere- - If he's at a continuous- - Like to pointing us. - Madison! - I'm just concluding a perimeter, actually. So... Oh. - That's fine. - Thank you. My phone's in there. Hey, guys, who let you in here? Have you guys seen Chrissy? The two dudes who just left, they said that she let them in. Aaron wasn't with her? Isn't Aaron's party tonight? He's still having his party? Goddammit! Madison, don't say that. 5-5-5-9-9. 4-9-9-6-5. When you left last night, I thought you were... I don't know. I feel like you're mad at me. Are you? I'm not supposed to spoil you. Feels weird. Aaron. Let go, what's wrong you? Aaron. You're acting different. Don't answer that. Hello? Yo, slow down, I can't hear you. Chrissy? No, I don't know. Maddy, come on! It's my fuckin' birthday, all right? He showed up at work. He's fine, it's over. That is so uncomfortable. - Okay. - All right. What? He showed... Aaron? Uh-huh. Just a second. All right. Aaron said he showed up at work. - What? - So I'm heading there. Let's go. They don't allow visitors after hours, so you won't be able to get in without me. Okay. I'll drive. Keep us posted. Here is the birthday boy! All hail the birthday boy! - Aaron? - Let him eat cake! Is it not a special day? Our dear friend, Aaron, says goodbye to his youth. - Sorry, bud. - Here. I mean, think about it. With all of the crazy shit that's goin' on in the world, it's kind of a miracle anyone reaches such an age. Grandpa! Do you recognize anyone speaking? What a world- - But that older generation, they created this hell, guys. And now that it's our time, we are fucked. I mean, we truly, truly, truly... - I know... - Ah, stop. We can't even think about tomorrow, because there isn't one. Where the fuck is Taylor? He was getting his panties all in a bunch trying to get us to go. Wouldn't even let me smoke my fucking cigarette. Hey, so Aaron actually just called, and Jesse showed up at work, - so we're- - Taylor fell off the roof. You know that's just an incredibly unfunny joke. Oh fuck, Paige! What? Call 9-1-1! To new beginnings! Drink! Numb yourselves! Nothing matters. Just enjoy the ride. Where are you going, my lambs? Hey, my friend is on the ground bleeding profusely. How the fuck did you know? Hello? Hi! I pushed him. What? We have to clear the brush to grow the forest. What kinda fuckin' speech is that? Hey! - Oh! - Whoa! Yo, hey! Oh shit, okay, all right. Everybody's okay. Get off! Get off! What the fuck is going on? Don't fucking touch me! Run! Oh, do you not believe your destination is finally inside today? Put me down! Goodbye has come. He has come to collect. What's wrong? I'm scared. Let us in. You won't feel a thing. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me! What the fuck? What? These lights stay on 24 hours for residents. I'm just gonna go check on security. Okay. They're not there. Security's not there! What do you mean? They're just gone. I found these. Okay, thanks. Come on. Can we find a light switch? Yeah, it's all controlled by one panel. It's at the nurse's station. Okay. That's where we're going. It's right over here. What the fuck? What happened? - What the fuck? - My god. These definitely are not right. Okay, breathe. Stay calm. See? Yeah, but who... Huh. Hey. Hey! What the hell is going on? Why do you have the lights turned off? It's really freaky - without anyone around. - Hello? What is all this? Your phone's off the hook. When did you start - working night shift? - What's all what? This mess. They asked me to. We had a problem with some of the residents. What does that mean? They wouldn't follow orders. What the fuck are - you talking about? - Tim, did Jesse show up here? I heard he came to work. - Yeah. - He wants to see you. He did. Wait, what? You talked to him? - He's waiting for you. - Wait, when? Wait, are you talking about? What the fuck? Rachel! Get away from her! Stop! Please. Wait, what? Oh my god! Madison! Don't be hard on Jesse! He just needs to talk to you. You and Jesse are so good together. I know it. If only you would just know it. I think you'd be much happier than you are now. You know how to talk, don't you? I know you can hear me! I'm so sorry. - I didn't mean to wake you. - You can't hide here. - You'll be one of us soon. - Shh, shh, shh! - I know you. - What? You're that selfish bitch! She's here! The selfish bitch is here! Anyone there? Aaron? Please help! Maddy! Thank god! Maddy, come on, we'll get the fuck outta here. Maddy, please, untie me. What the fuck is going on? I don't know, I don't know. They're all fuckin' brainwashed. Okay, well, hold on, hold on. No, no, don't leave me! They'll kill you! Please, Maddy! Maddy, untie me! Okay. What the fuck was that? Someone's here. Someone's here, someone's here. Shh. Where have you been? Jesse? No, no, no, no, - he's one of them. - Oh my god, baby. Maddy, Maddy, he's one of them. Don't go. What? One of who? Oh. What the fuck? So, you're not Jesse. Somebody! Somebody help! Help! Stop. What are you doing? Stop, stop! Sometimes I get carried away. You did all this? I would never do it to you. I don't understand what's happening. Neither do I. But we can find out together. Let me change you. Please, just let us go. You always try to control every fucking little thing. I'm trying to - give that to you! - Don't come any closer. - Jesse. - We were so good together. Oh my god. Don't hurt her, Jesse! Leave her alone! I have only ever loved you. I'm sorry. Help, somebody help! Chrissy? - Oh my god, Chrissy? - No, don't come near her! No, Maddy! Why are you doing this? She didn't do anything? You can't leave this. I want it. Do you love me? Stop, stop. Yes, okay, yes! Then there can only be me. I don't understand. Madison, you have to do what he says. Madison, please. Maddy, no, don't fuckin' listen. They're fuckin' crazy. I just want what's best for us. Madison. Madison, you have to listen to him. You have to listen to him, - please. - Maddy, look at me! - Don't listen to him- - She's with them! All right, stop! All right, all right, all right. Maddy, what are you doing? Maddy, what are you doing? Are you fucking crazy? Nope, don't listen to them. - Please. - Maddy, no. - Maddy, Maddy, Maddy, look, - Make it stop! don't fucking... Somebody help! Help us! Please, Maddy! - Maddy, please, Maddy. - Maddy! Maddy, wait. - Madison. - Wait, don't. Do not. Maddy, Maddy, no, no, no, no, wait. Somebody! - You're mine! - Wait! - I will kill her! - Wait, wait! Maddy, Maddy, Maddy! Wait! Maddy! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait just a fucking... Listen to me, Maddy! Again. Again! Are you mine? You're too perfect to be like everyone else. Do you feel it? We're all connected. You'll be stronger when you're one of us. There you are. I've missed you so much. Ow! Stop. Stop! Maddy? Are you mine? Come. You will be my queen. Stop, what are you doing? How could you, you bitch? Why? Why? Why?
