Imagine it. Imagine it someone came and built a high wall right around your neighborhood, so you couldn't get out. That's what the Nazis did to us. No one's allowed out at night. It's so quiet you can hear someone cough right across the other side of the ghetto. Everyone is scared. Even my dad. Even my uncle, who pretends not to be. Every week, the Nazis come and take more people away. They call this "selection". You never know when a selection is going to happen or who they're going to take next. There aren't many of us left now. Only the strong ones who can work. Us kids have to be careful in the daytime. At night, I hide in the loft so they don't find me. My uncle gave me a book. It's called Robinson Crusoe. I found one. I'll give you 30. No, it's 40, Avrum. Thirty! Starting now. One, two, three, Come with me. five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen- Selection! Selection. No one leaves. Everyone keep working. Women and children this time, Stefan. Where is Alex? In Bird Street playing with the Gryn kids. Alex, oh, Alex. Stop it, Avrum. You're hurting him! Leave him alone! You're hurting him! Leave him alone! As in canned rat. Come down, Avrum. It's not safe. Go on, Alex. Go get the stinking rat yourself. Go on, dodo. Go get the rat. Go on! Alright now! Get in line! Hey, you! Stop! Stop! Hide! Selection! Hide in there! Alex! Come on, Alex. Alex, come on! Alex, come with us! There's no time! Hey! Come back! Hey! Stop! Get back! Nothing here. Let's go! Come on! Don't worry, Snow. Move! Stay in line! Stay in line! Alex. Alex! Alex! How could you sleep?! I knew you'd come. I knew it. We won't take him to the factory anymore. The factory?s safe. There are ways to get out. I'll see that he's alright. Besides, I need a footrest. He stays in the bunker with the Gryns. What about Mrs. Gryn's eyes? What about Mrs. Gryn's eyes? She stares. There, you see? You expect the boy to stay at a dirty slimy cellar with someone who just stares? They've changed the rules, Alex. From now on, they catch you with kids, you're on the next train. You understand? Now good night. Myriam told me she said it was like a holiday place. "Myriam told me, " huh? So where are the postcards from this holiday place? Where are the letters? Remember Aunt Lunya? She couldn't fart without writing someone about it. Boruch! It sneaked out. What do you want? What are they doing to these people? I don't know. I don't know either. Here. Take my own mezuza in that tree of yours up there. Keep it with you at all times. It will ward off evil. Mrs. Gryn too? No more staring eyes. Thanks, Uncle Boruch. Don't mention it. "We were shipwrecked. There wasn't a house to live in. "Or any food or clothes. At night, I thought I'd get eaten by wild animals. " You bake the bread too heavy sometimes. They are killing us. No one knows that. Now you don't have your mezuza for protection. Maybe Mrs. Gryn with her staring eyes will come looking for you. Oh, I live in hope. Yeah. Mrs. Gryn, Mrs. Gryn, I didn't know you cared. The first time I saw you all you did was stare. Mrs. Gryn, Mrs. Gryn, I didn't know you cared. Just keep your head down, you old fool. Then there was my great grandmother. Your great-great-grandmother. Such a woman. Terrifying. She could eat Mrs. Gryn for breakfast, lunch and tea and then spit out the bones. What is this supposed to be? A bowline, like you said. A bowline? Hmm. Now this, this is a bowline, Alex. How many times have I told you, huh? Here, that's a bowline. There's mail for you, uncle. Hmm. What do we have Alex, I told you not to bring him in here. It's against the law. Besides, there's all kinds of gray mice in this factory and they're crazy. They'll kill him and eat him just as soon as look at him. You're just scared of him. Oh. You, Jew. Yes, you. Come here. How old are you? 59. 59? Why aren't you working? I'm the storekeeper. Load it on the truck. How old are you, Jew? 59. How old are you?! How old are you?! How old are you?! I'd eat that German officer's boots with my naked teeth. Not funny. Ah. I'll feel better when I get my medicine. Stop talking for once in your life. I need my medicine. This is not the fake stuff. This is the best Russian vodka. Don't ask me how much I paid for it. How much you pay for it? Tomorrow you should stay in the bunker with Alex. Stay in the bunker with me, Uncle. I've got my work to do. This looks like a very inferior brand, you know? Right, if you don't want it- On the other hand- A man should never drink alone. The boy is right. A delicate palate like yours shouldn't touch this. I'll sacrifice myself. Good. And now steady, breathe out. Now gently squeeze. Hey, bullseye. The bullets didn't fall out. Clip. It's called a clip. What does he want to be a marksman for? Is the war over already? You should have told me. I'll watch out for him, I'll see that he's alright. It's not a bad idea for a young man to learn how to shoot a pistol. Come on. Out. Get out. No, no, please! Wait here. Wait. You'll take pneumonia down there. You'll be safe, you'll be outside. What do you care? We need some more penicillin. Thank you, Mrs. Gryn. See you tonight. Look, Yossi. You can't bring that filthy thing in here. You scared or something? You know what Momma said! Hey, Yossi. Look, Yossi. Seek it. Seek it, Snow. Seek it. Seek it. Alex, how many times have I told you? It spreads diseases. Put it in here! Put it here! Alex! Alex! He'll get us all killed. What happened to the signal? Mrs. Gryn. She was going to kill Snow. Stop it, Alex. You're starting to believe your own stories. Sorry. Where's the rodent? At home. That's the best place. Go on. What's he doing here? I told you to stay in the bunker! What's happening? They're clearing the houses. They're everywhere! Someone talked. Out. Hey! Jacob, isn't it? I knew your father. Move it. I'll take him. No, we stick with the plan. He comes with me. I don't want no arguments. We don't have time for this. You know what you have to do. Now go! Good-bye! Take this. Stay with your uncle. Do everything he says, hm? Wait for me. No matter what happens, I will come back for you. Wait for me. They're closing the factory. They're clearing the ghetto. This time it's all of you. Good luck, Boruch. That one! Bring him out! Now, remember, you stay off the street and wait. Wait. How long for? As long as it takes. An hour, maybe a day. Just wait. Your dad will come and get you, Alex. Remember that. He will come for you. Remember. Alright. Alright. Go with. Run now. Go. Ohhh, no! No! Go back! Go back! No! Go back! Go back! Go back! Go back! Come, come. Shh! Snow. Snow. Snow. Snow. Snow. Snow! Snow? Snow? Snow? Rescued from the camps. "My man, Friday, threw himself "at my feet in gratitude "for my having saved him from the cannibals' cooking pot. " In a little time, I began to speak to him "and teach him to speak to me. " I let him know his name should be Friday "which was the day I saved his life. " I likewise taught him to say master and let him know that was to be my name. " Got that? Listen to Master Alex. We call this bread. Bread, good. We eat bread. You like? Bye, Snow. Seek it, Snow. Seek it. Yes. Good boy, Snow. Seek it. Good boy, Snow. Good boy. I found them. They're mine. Go away. Please. I haven't got any food. Go away. And the rest. Careful. Steady. A very inferior brand. A man should never drink alone. Oh, quite right. Dad? Alex, my boy. My brave, brave boy. I knew you'd come. I knew. Uncle Boruch! You're alright! It takes more than that. Leopards can't climb trees. You listen to your uncle Boruch. One day, you'll be rich and famous, just like him. You've got to sacrifice yourself. Remember. Dad? Dad? Take it. Leave that. What's that?! Leopards can't climb trees. Ahh! I didn't do anything. You can't trust me and I can't trust you. What's your name? Alex. What's in the sack, Alex? Rope. What's it for? My dad. Ha. Some dad sending his kid out to risk his neck. He couldn't come himself. Are you Jewish, Alex? No. Tell me the truth. I'm Polish. May the Lord be with you. And you say-hm? Tongue. Come on. It's Latin. It means "And also with you. " I know. Of course I know Latin. Of course you do. You're a Pole and a survivor. Now go on, go back to your dad. Go on, move! Day one. Just you and me. And the cannibals. Where? How many? Twelve. Out! Out! We'll do whatever you say! Henryk! Who shot him? Me. Oh my God. Freddy! Come here! Get down! Come on. Come on. Done alright for yourself. Do you have any more ammunition for this? Take it. It's yours, isn't it? No? What's this? Hello. What's your name? Snow. Snow? 'Cause he's white, like snow? You alright? I killed him. I didn't mean to. Hey, hey. What are you doing here all on your own? I'm waiting for my dad. How long has your dad been gone, Alex? Thirty-six days. Some water. Relax. This leads to the other side. I'll go contact with the Polish Underground. A priest. I think he can help us. So I'm gonna go find him, alright? You be careful on your way home. Make sure Henryk gets plenty of water. No champagne. I'll see you in a couple of hours. Sorry. I had to. You were making too much noise. Hey, you! Thank you, bye-bye, dear. You must be rich throwing your money about like that. Bye bye, Mrs. Takysky. Bye, Stasya. Yes? Are you the doc's place? Is something wrong with it? It's a bit difficult to explain out here. What can I do for you? Are you sick? It's not me. It's my friend. The authorities insist upon hearing of anything suspicious. I watch you play chess. On the telephone. Through the window. How did you find your way out? Freddy showed me. He hasn't come back. Friends of the priest. Don't talk so much. He doesn't need to know these things. Of course he does. Did you put some tinned beef in? Yes, yes. We're gonna make sure your friend gets well. Hi Doctor Studzinski. Stasya Mustn?t pass on stairs. It's bad luck. Oh, hello again. I didn't recognize you at first. Come along, Alex. What does that girl know about you? Nothing. I promise. I can't climb that! I'll take your bag. It-it can take your weight. Now, your treatment. I'm trying to get some more but it's a lot of money on the black market. If he gets worse, he'll have to come to me. I can't afford the risk. Now, you take that. A lot of people rely on me, you understand. A lot of people. Stand back. Stand back! What do you think you're doing? Who are you, anyway? It's the little Jew fish. He's mine, come here little Jew fish. Come on, Alex, we should have been home ages ago. Are you coming? Mother will kill us. You know how she hates it when we're late. She's a Yid lover! Thanks. That's alright. You're not from around here, are you? No. It's a boat ride from here. Rough seas. Sharks. Do you go to the park on Sundays? Yeah. You know the little house? Four o'clock? Bye then. Hope your boat doesn't sink. You're better. Where's Freddy? He went for help. How long? Ten days ago. He built a house in a tree. He found a rope ladder on the roof. He lived there for a long time. He made his own weapons. He caught things to eat. Then he rescued Friday. But it's just a boy's story. Maybe he could've stayed alive for a week or two. He could survive forever if he had to if no one came to rescue him. Alright, I give up. Look, I'd better go home. Me too. Dad will be wondering where I am. See you tomorrow? Alright. Bye, then. Bye. Come on, Snow. Fetch it. Go on. Seek it. Seek it. Good boy. I didn't know which ones. You look like a scientist. Now you look like a jeweller. Oh, hello young man. What have you got there? Ohh, I thought it was the Plaza. It says here there's going to be a war soon. Not funny. Last dose. I'll tell you something. I could do with something proper to eat. I could do with something to get me on my feet. Something decent. I'm thinking steaks. Fried potatoes. Now, get me something proper to eat or I'll eat that bloody rat of yours. What are you looking at all the time? It says here- Shh. I'm reading. "The dinner party is the most formal of all types of present day entertaining. " "When man Friday and I arrived at the cannibals' camp, "the very blood ran cold in my veins at the horror of what I saw. " "Your guests should not be seated too close to one another. " "There was an eerie silence hanging over the hut. There was no sign of any of the inhabitants. " "I arranged my guests around the table so that-" "Their bones were strewn about, along with human skulls and flesh. " "I decided a three-course meal was quite in order. I-" "-turned about to see a cannibal shoot me with a-" "-fruit and a selection of cheeses. " What are you doing? I've got to get out. You can't. You'll never get down that rope ladder. I've got to see a man. I'll go. I can do it. I can find him. How's your Latin? Very good. Think you could learn some more? You have come to confess your sins. Just exactly what does that mean? I don't know. Alex. The little survivor. How can I help you, Alex? The priest said the ghetto walls are coming down any day now. The walls coming down and the Poles are moving in? Obvious that the apartment is going free. But the war goes on. I think you should come with me. This many will get so fat they'll float away into space. This many will get so thin they'll slip down the drain. This many will get reborn as flees and get squashed. Don't you want to know how many children you're gonna have? How many? How many? I'm not telling you. You have to find out for yourself. Dad doesn't want a corpse for a son. I don't want a corpse for a friend. This place is finished. It'll be swarming with Poles and German soldiers in a couple of days. Face up to it. Alex, the chances are your daddy is never coming back. It doesn't matter, does it? He can make his own decision. That future of yours. It's waiting for you. Good luck. Look! Wait a minute! Little Jew fish! Come back! Hey you, Jew fish, come here. I'm sorry, it wasn't me. I didn't do it. Please. I'm sorry. Gestapo! Run! Hurry. Can I come in please? What's it like? To live in an apartment. More like a cupboard. You live in a cupboard? Well, under a cupboard, actually, but I have a bed and a cooker, and everything I need. Really, it's fine. We're leaving tomorrow. Leaving? We're going to my uncle's in the country. Stasya? It's okay, it's my mother. You can't miss the curfew. You'd best stay the night. You'll have to be up early in the morning though. He could come with us, couldn't he, Mama? That's enough, Stasya. Clear the table please. Thank you. You can come with us, if you want to. We'll leave a message for your father. We'll make sure he knows where to find you. Just came to say good night. See you tomorrow then. You will come with us, won't you? Good night. Good night. Hey! Go on! Hey! Go on! Tear it down! The Jews are out. Out now. It's dangerous in here. Get this area closed off before someone gets killed. Oh. Wake up, Snow. Snow. Snow. Goodbye, Snow. Alex. Alex. Alex? Dad? Are you real? Yes. I'm real. I knew you'd come. At first, it seemed like a mirage. A strange sort of shimmering on the horizon. Slowly, bit by bit, it got closer and clearer. Then, there it was. The most beautiful ship. Full sail, with all its flags flying. It was coming to my island. Coming to my rescue. It was going to take me home.
