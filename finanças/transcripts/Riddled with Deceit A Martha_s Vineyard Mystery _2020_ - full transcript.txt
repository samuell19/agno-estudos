Victor Gaines. Okay, we got a possible situation. We've got two men. Masked and armed. Drop your weapons. I've got this. You guys move. Gentlemen. Come on, Victor. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? ♪ Now, I'm takin' my chances ♪ ♪ Bringin' it down now ♪ ♪ For letting go ♪ ♪ For letting go ♪ ♪ Hopin' for somethin' ♪ ♪ To come along and ♪ ♪ Never let me go ♪ ♪ Never let me go ♪ ♪ When I get there ♪ ♪ I will sing my song ♪ ♪ Never regret ♪ ♪ Givin' all you got ♪ Hm. Morning, Jeff. Chief. You decent? Try to be. What'd you run out of coffee down at the station, chief? Well, I would not say no to a cup. But I assume that's not why you're here. There was some serious action over in Boston last night. Attempted robbery of a brooch containing gems called the Lakshmi emeralds. One of the thieves was shot during the attempt. He's still in the ICU. The other one got away. Must be some serious hardware. Roughly 5 million dollars. Woof. Big money. The brooch was being picked up from the Gaines and Associates auction house last night. To travel here. To Martha's Vineyard? Hm. To the Pendray Hotel, to be specific. The Lakshmi emeralds belong to Brittany Prajna. Britt as in Zee's best friend? The emeralds were stolen from her family over 60 years ago. And you're thinkin' the action might be outta here? Well, Britt's hosting an event over at the Pendray tonight to celebrate the return of this infamous family heirloom. All the vineyard elite is gonna be there. Thornbury security is overseeing the transfer. You know, coordinating, of course, with Martha's Vineyard PD. Well, Thornbury's top notch. You workin' with Mike Vincent? You know him? Well, he's ex-Boston PD. He offered me a job with Thornbury after I was discharged from the force. Oh. Actually, J.W., that's kinda why I'm here. Chief. I'm retired. Special plainclothes detail. One night and the pay is generous. Vineyard life's not cheap and I know you're pension's not gonna take you that far. You're not wrong. You know, your father used to say you were the best detective in Boston. Well, from what I've seen, he was right. I would be a fool not to try to take advantage of those skills. And do I have to wear a suit? No, no, no, no. A tux. Jeff. What do you think about the upgrade? The place looks great, Bob. Change is the only constant in life. Well, that, and good coffee. Ain't that the truth? Fried clams. Homemade tartar sauce. Very nice. Peruvian dark roast, one sugar. You know me too well. Mm. You, uh, you hear about this? The Lakshmi emeralds? Ah yes. Lakshmi. The Hindu goddess of prosperity, wealth, and purity. Things of great beauty, like the emeralds, drive people to extremes. That's probably why the brooch is said to be cursed. Cursed? I don't know about that, but somethin' like this comes to the Vineyard, people tend to get a little... Overly excited. To extremes. Excuse me, sir? I am looking for a friend of mine. His name is Jeff Jackson. He's about your height, green eyes, wouldn't be caught dead in a suit. Your dad wanted me to wear a tux. That wasn't gonna happen. Last time I wore one of those, it was senior prom. It was powder blue. Oh I wish I would've seen that. If only you'd gone to school on the island. If only. Well, I assume your dad told you that he hired me tonight? Yes, Britt's very happy about it. Oh. So am I. Likin' the new hair. Yeah, I thought it was time for a change. Zee, looks like you got your man. Ah, I may have mentioned offhand that my dad could use some extra security and that was supposed to be between us. So where's all this goin' down? Oh, right this way. Jeff Jackson. Mike. Long time. Heard about Boston. Sounds like somebody knew when you'd be pickin' up the gems. Yeah, sure looks like that. Zee. Mike Vincent. Thornbury Security. Director of Thornbury Security, actually. This is Zee Madeiras. Doctor Zee Madeiras, actually. - Oh. - Excellent. Everyone's acquainted now. Britt, I've noticed quite a few hotel guests milling about. Could we go over the registered guest list? Figure out who's coming and going? I'll have Chelsea grab the logbook from my office. Great. So, the unveiling will happen here, in the parlor. Vineyard PD will take care of the perimeter. My boys will deliver the package. I'll be on point. Jeff. You can drift. You're good at that. I'm good at lots of things. So I hear, Mr. Jackson. Willard. So you're thrice presidential, I hear. Your name. Jefferson Washington Jackson. Ah. Clever. This is my godfather Willard Gilford. He loves wordplay. Pleasure. Britt's father and I were very close friends. I've looked after Britt since her parents passed away. And he's been my confidant ever since. In fact, he advised me on all the upgrades to the Pendray. And as Britt's family attorney, I've handled the return of the Lakshmi emeralds. Mm. Well, I should get to work. Need to do a walkthrough of the grounds. I'll join you. I know this hotel like the back of my hand. Willard. Chief. This is a primary access point. We'll make sure that no unauthorized personnel come in or out of the hotel. Well, if someone's gonna make a play for the emeralds tonight, I doubt they're gonna walk out the front door. My great, great-grandfather gave them to his daughter. But when she fell in love with a peasant, he disinherited her. And, worse, he got a holy man to put a curse on the emeralds. Yeah, I'm thinkin' Vineyard PD should also patrol the courtyard. There's a lot of ground to cover out here. It's better if we hold the perimeter. No one in or out. If that's the way you wanna play it. Anyway, my grandparents worked hard, saved, and built this hotel. When presidents and royalty visited the vineyard, they all wanted to see the Lakshmi emeralds. Until it was stolen right off of Britt's grandmother's dress while she was attending the opera. Grandma said it was the curse catching up with her. More like greed. It wasn't long after that until the emeralds disappeared into the black market, right? Until a few years ago when I finally believed that I tracked them down. I held the brooch in my hand only to discover that it was a fake. A well-crafted facsimile of the real thing. Yeah. Willard was heartbroken. 'Scuse me. Britt. I have that info you asked for from the logbook. Oh. Thanks, Chelsea. Uh, Chief? Excuse me. Who was it that was trying to auction off the emeralds? A month or so ago, a woman named Regina Fields brought them to Victor Gaines and Associates in Boston. Completely unaware of their origins. Yeah, fortunately, the Gaines gemologist recognized them and they froze the auction. Victor Gaines contacted me. I confirmed the fact that they were the Lakshmi emeralds. Speaking of, we should ready the package for transport. Mr. Gilford. Well, Mike Vincent seems to have everything under control. Yeah. Let's hope so. Evening. Hm. Hey, are you coming in? The seats are filling up. Ah, it's fine. I'm gonna stand. I'm on duty. So, can you point out any mucky-mucks that might have a special interest in the emeralds? Well, the man in the glasses is Victor Gaines. As in, Victor Gaines and Associates? Mm hm. The auction house who identified the brooch, right? Right. And who's the lady he's whispering sweet nothings to? That's Rebecca Lane. She runs the vineyard art museum. We have an art museum? Never been. Shocking. That's Britt's cousin, Lloyd. I haven't seen him in years. He's not Britt's favorite. Can't pick your family. Okay. If everyone can please take your seats. I'm gonna get my seat. Go right ahead. Well, welcome all to The Pendray and to this historic night. Thank you so much for coming. I especially wanna thank my Godfather, Willard Gilford and Victor Gaines for all they've done to bring the Lakshmi emeralds home at last. And a very special thanks to Freddy and Regina Fields. When Regina Fields brought them to Mr. Gaines's auction house, one of his experts recognized the Lakshmi emeralds. Their prominence was verified and, so, here we all are. In one week, I will be signing the brooch over to the Smithsonian where it will be displayed alongside so many other priceless treasures. But during that time, guests of The Pendray, will be able to see the Lakshmi emeralds right here as I will be wearing them. And, now, the moment you've all been waiting for. Ladies and gentlemen, the Lakshmi emeralds. Beautiful. Now that's worth stealing. Britt. Oh. And when my great-grandparents came to America, it was all they had. Not counting their love, of course. Oh, I like that. Now, where in India did you say the brooch originally came from? The gems, themselves, come from the Ajmer-Rajsamand belt of Rajasthan. They were cut and set into the brooch by a master craftsman in Jaipur. Pardon my intrusion, Adij Sharma. But please, call me AJ. Culture India Magazine. I'm writing a comprehensive story on the history of the Lakshmi emeralds. I was very much hoping I could arrange an interview. I was actually just in the middle of doing that. Jackie Shawl, Vineyard Gazette. So sorry. I meant no offense. Mm. Ms. Prajna, please call me. At your convenience. Sorry about that. If someone cost me a commission on a five million dollar sale, I don't think I'd be treatin' him like my best buddy. Gaines has ulterior motives? I think 90% of this crowd has ulterior motives. Hey, guys. - Hi. - Hey. So how does it feel? Not too shabby, right? It's unbelievable. So how'd it feel tonight being back in the game? Better than hanging around waiting for the blue fish to bite? This was a one-time deal, Mike. I'm retired. Come on, Jeff. I heard the rumors. What happened to your partner was not your fault. He wouldn't have been there if it wasn't for me. Listen. You are too good a detective to be cashin' in your chips and wastin' away on this island. You remember that offer I made you? Yeah. Yeah, well it still stands. Come to Thornbury. Be my number two. Thanks, Mike, but I'm exactly where I need to be. What a night. I'm beat. Lloyd. Hello, Britt. I'd embrace you but I wouldn't wanna damage the goods. Mr. Gilford. Mr. Prajna. Quite the fairytale ending you've engineered for Britt. Completely disregarding my claim to the brooch. Your claim is entirely false, Lloyd. Britt's grandmother's will made that very clear. Lakshmi emeralds were to be left to Britt. The brooch. The hotel. Britt gets it all. Lloyd. Good luck holding onto it. Everything okay? Yeah. So, you don't want me to wear it tomorrow or, whenever, because what? Somebody's gonna try to take it off me at gunpoint or something? It's definitely a possibility, yeah. You don't know how many armed holdups I've dealt with back in Boston. But this is Martha's Vineyard. We have crime here, too, Britt. My grandma would want me to wear it. Proudly. Britt, listen to the professionals. I could never live with myself if anything happened to you. You can wear it at the hotel from time to time where there are security cameras and you're surrounded by trusted staff. But you need to lock it up here at night. Okay. Yeah. You're right. How often do you change that? Every week. And only my assistant manager, Chelsea and I have the code. Mm. Nice security system. Yes. Willard convinced me to upgrade a few years ago. Yeah. This is the right decision. Thank you, both. Yeah. All good? All good. I'm gonna wrap things up and head home. And I'll say my goodnight. - Goodnight. - Night. Thanks, both of you, for today. Happy to help, Britt. After all, I did get paid. Well, I'm grateful you took the gig. Goodnight, guys. - Night. - Take care, Britt. Your dad take off? He said something about a basket of fried clams calling his name. Oof. That doesn't sound half bad. You're asking me to dinner? No. No, not dinner, dinner. Just beer and clams. Well all right then. Thanks for everything tonight. You were pretty great. Well, I am a well-trained, former officer of the law, so. Mm. What? Oh, it's just the, uh, tartar sauce. I mean, I'm just sayin' you should try my tartar sauce. You make tartar sauce? Oh yeah. Oh yeah? Yeah. I'm sorry. How did a main lander get so cocky about his tartar sauce? It's not like I grew up in Iowa. You are aware that Boston is renowned for its seafood, are you not? Sure. If you can even call mainland cuisine seafood. And you're callin' me cocky? Truth be told, my dad taught me his recipe for tartar sauce the last summer that I spent on the Vineyard. Ah yes, that was quite the summer. Yes it was. We were such kids. We didn't think so at the time, though, did we? And look at us now. All grown up. Well, you're grown up. I'm still pretty immature. Well. So? Am I wrong? Yeah, no, what these need is my homemade tartar sauce. Oh. You make tartar sauce? I don't make tartar sauce, I bring it to life. - Bold, bold statement. - I'm tellin' you. Hey, Britt, what's up? Zee, I think there might be someone in my house. Britt? Call 911 and get outta there. Yeah. Where is it? No. Where is it? Britt? Britt? Oh no. Okay, so, let me know when anything changes. Thank you. Hey. So, she has a concussion. She has a hairline fracture of the skull which is causing cerebral edema. Swelling of the brain. It will subside, but she does need to stay here for a day or two. I'm sorry. I shoulda known. No. Mr. Jackson. It's because of you and Zee that she's still alive. If anyone's to blame, it's me. Helping bring that accursed brooch back to this island. I love that young woman like a daughter. There's nothing that I wouldn't do for her. You have any ideas? Well, we all heard her cousin Lloyd threaten her tonight at the event. I think he has a place near Vineyard Haven. I'll run on down for a little chat. Thanks, guys. Yeah. What's up? I was just thinkin' if someone broke into her house, they're probably targeting the hotel, too. 'Kay. Did you see that? Yeah. Come on. It's okay, everyone. Please stay calm. Hello? It's Jeff and Zee. We need to check the safe. Yes, of course. Right this way. Wait. Let me see that. Oh no. It's gone. The key pad and the fingerprint reader were both ripped out. Brooch was on the second shelf. It's the only item that was taken. Chief, we got somethin'. Take a look at this. The main breaker was shut off. What's this? Somebody intentionally cut the power. Power went out at about 11:45. So let's start at 11:30. Well the basement cam's completely blacked down. The thief didn't have a lot of time to bypass the locks and get out of the hotel unseen. Do these look like your guests? I mean, yeah, I think so. Look. He's tryin' to hide his face. He knows he's on camera. Chelsea, scroll back to before the power went out. Mm hm. Keep goin'. Let's see if anyone passes through that might resemble our guy in the hoodie. We're gonna need to look at anyone who was at the event who had any kinda connection to the brooch. Well, obviously cousin Lloyd. Already on the list. Victor Gaines from the auction house? The couple who returned the brooch. The Fields, yeah. Freddy and Regina, right? Right. And then, of course, Willard, but I. I just really don't think he's a suspect. Already called him. Voicemail. Pause it. You recognize him, Zee? Ah, that's the waiter. Same build as the guy from the front door. Well, whoever he is, he just went to the top of the list. The ferries and the airports are shut down until tomorrow. The coast guard will be patrolling the marinas, make sure there's no midnight departures. See you in the morning. Night, dad. Night, Chief. Goodnight, JW. Thanks again for helping us tonight. Yeah, of course. You worried about Britt? Yeah, but she's tough. She'll be okay. Let me get you home. Okay. You know there's one thing that's still botherin' me? What's that? That you assume that you make better tartar sauce than I do. Oh, come on. We'll see. Another late night for you, huh? You could say that. Behind every great fortune lies a great crime. Huh? Balzac. Heard about the theft at The Pendray. How'd you hear about that? Nothing travels faster than light with the exception of bad news. Jackie posted the story last night. Last night? How'd she get it that fast? I don't know. Why don't you ask her? Can I get you anything to start? Jackie. Jeff. I hear you were there last night when the Lakshmi emeralds were stolen. Who told you that? You know I can't burn my source. Do you wanna give me a statement. You know the rules. Talk to the chief if you want a statement. I already tried, he gave me nothing. But I figured you and I have a much better relationship. Oh. Do we? What do you say? I'm sorry, Jackie, but, uh, you have a wonderful day. Mornin', JW. Mornin', Chief. I wanted to let you know I stopped by Lloyd Prajna's house. No answer. No car in the drive. Hasn't been seen at the terminals. But we're lookin'. There's a lot of people to question. And I know the last time you helped us out it was supposed to be a one time thing. I hate to ask... Was kinda hopin' you would. You know, this is more than just a five million dollar family heirloom. Someone went after Britt. Put her in the hospital. Zee could've been with her. Yeah. Where do you wanna start? Well. Have you located that mysterious little waiter? Nope. Then why don't I start with Stan over at Vineyard Island Catering? They worked the job. Sounds good. We'll find this guy. Yeah, I recognize him. Last minute hire. Rodney Emerson. He was supposed to pick up his check this morning, but he no-showed. Figures. Tried his number, but it's no longer in service. Oh, it says here he lives at 4 Yawkey Way. That's Fenway Park. Ah. Guy's got a sense of humor, I'll give him that. Thanks, Stan. Okay. Can you run the priors on a Rodney Emerson? Yeah, I'll have O'Connor run him through the system. Hey, listen, I tracked down the Fields. Those people who had to give up the brooch. It turns out they're stayin' on the island. It's right near you. Text me the address. Yeah. Britt, I'm so sorry. At least I'm alive. God, I just. I just got the emeralds back. I know. You know my dad has the entire force working on it, right? How did Willard take the news? I actually don't know. We haven't been able to reach him. Hm. Yeah, we were in disbelief when we heard what happened. Even in a lovely place like this, such a violent crime like that could be committed. But, of course, I should know that. And why's that? Regina was mugged twice outside our brownstone. But, I've taken the necessary precautions. Good for you. May I ask your whereabouts last night? We were in town for awhile. We heard some music at The Duke. We're not under any kind of suspicion, are we? I'm just working in conjunction with Vineyard PD. You know, we're going through the necessary protocol. Well, as my husband said, this was all quite a shock for us. I bet it was an even bigger shock when you realized that the brooch didn't actually belong to you. Yes. Yes it was. Of course when I bought it at an estate sale, I had no idea it was stolen goods. No one did. Gaines said it's probably changed hands dozen of times. Did you know Victor Gaines previously? Only by name. We brought the brooch to him for appraisal. We certainly didn't expect to learn that what we had were the Lakshmi emeralds. Of course not. But it was Gaines who invited you to the event at the Pendray? We wanted to come. See that sweet girl's family heirloom returned. Mm hm. Well, thank you for your time. You plan on heading back to the mainland soon? We actually have the rental for another two weeks. We were hoping to enjoy our time on the vineyard. Good. Well, enjoy. Thank you. Yeah. I really don't know, sir. Maybe I can just take your number and give you a call or- Oh, Zee. Maybe you can help. Uh, this gentleman is asking about Britt. Oh, what about her? Yes, I'm AJ. Sharma. I'm writing a feature article for Culture India magazine about the Lakshmi emeralds. Right. I remember you from the event. Yes. Yes. I'm working on a piece about Indian immigration into America told through the specific story of Britt's family. I was hoping she could fill in some blanks. Um. Unfortunately, Britt's in the hospital. Oh. Is she all right? Yeah, she'll be out in a day or two. Good. Well, please let her know that I'll be on the island for another week and I'm available whenever she has time. I really need to talk to her. I'll let her know. Thank you. Then they said they're staying on the island for another couple of weeks. Well, they must be pretty miffed. Losin' a five million dollar brooch and then see it stolen. You would think, but they played it pretty close to the best. Any luck on Emerson? Well, we ran priors and found a connection between our waiter friend here and this thief, Shawn Murphy. That's the guy Thornbury put in the ICU. He was the one who was trying to steal the emeralds outside of the auction house. He's still in a coma. So, then Emerson must be the driver who got away. We got patrols out goin' door to door. We will find him. What about Victor Gaines? I called the auction house over in Boston. They said he is not available. They say why not? No. So you thinking he's still on the island? Well, we got people out lookin' for him and cousin Lloyd. All of a sudden, everyone seems to be MIA. Hey, Zee, what's up? Jeff. Hey. JW has graciously consented to help us out. That's great. Um, I'm here 'cause Britt's awake. So, you can talk to her if you want to. I do. I do. And, I called Willard again to tell him what happened and there's still no answer. Huh. Why don't you and I swing by? Tell him in person. Okay. Keep in touch, guys. Will do. Willard! Let's take a look around. Jeff. Is that a tie? That's Willard's. Willard! Willard! Zee. Oh no. He's dead. Hey. You okay? When we were kids, he used to take me and Britt sailing. Do you remember that beautiful boat he had, Dad? Sure I do. He was a good man. No sign of forced entry in the house, Chief. Nothing appears amiss. Coroner's showed up. Yeah, send him down. Did you find somethin', Zee? Well no blood. No blunt force trauma, but I found these. It's nitro glycerine. He had a bad heart. So, cardiac arrest? He's got some odd cutaneous marks here. And some more here and here. And do you see these abrasions on his wrist? Looks like he was tied up. You have any idea what might've caused these marks? No, but he was clearly under duress. And given that he had a heart condition... So, we're likely lookin' at a murder. Yeah. You find anything on the security footage, chief? We're still goin' through it. And what about Lloyd Prajna. He's not answering any of his phone calls. We gotta find Rodney Emerson yesterday. Hey. Do you mind helpin' me? Telling Britt. Yeah. Of course. Thanks. Come on. I just. This is so, so awful. Maybe the legend is true. You know, like the Hope Diamond. Maybe the brooch is cursed, I. I never should have had it brought back here. Britt. Don't even go there. It's not your fault. Thanks. I'll take 'em. Aw. Here. Thanks. It's from Willard. He must've sent them before... Sorry, Zee, can you? Yeah. "My darling Britt," Your safety means more to me than any gems. Let the brooch stay buried in the annals of time. We must discard the transient and seek the truth. For that, I hope you'll return to the works of Clifford Moncrief. They are a light in the darkness. "Love, Willard." Who's Clifford Moncrief? I. I don't know. Why do I feel like I know that name? It's late. Gonna head home? I've still gotta do Willard's autopsy. You gonna be okay? We need to know how he died. Yeah, well I was thinkin' I might head back over to the Pendray. Get a nightcap. You're going back to poke around, aren't you? You're gettin' pretty good at this whole detective thing, huh? Yeah. I'll check in later. I'll take a beer. Hello. How are you? No, I'm so happy that you called me. Thank you. I hope I'm not interrupting. Um, can we help you? Jeff Jackson. Friend of Britt. Prajna. Oh. Yes, of course. You were, um, you were at the event. Mind if I join you? Oh, we were just... Discussing our dealings in the, uh, in the art world. Dealings? As in five million dollar emerald brooches? You have any idea where that might've disappeared to? Well, I imagine it's already on the black market. You seem pretty confident. You have a lot of experience in that sorta thing? No, just an assumption. Actually, I don't know anything about that side of the business. You know, Jeff, I'm sorry, but, if you'd excuse us, I think we'd like to continue our evening. Of course. Just one more thing. Victor, you seem pretty chummy with, uh, Willard Gilford. Well, our paths have crossed over the years. I consider him a friend. Well, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but, Willard was found dead earlier this evening. What? How? We believe he was killed. Um. What's, uh. It's just shocking to hear about Willard, Mr. Jackson. I... I don't know anything about his death, but, please, um. If you could excuse me. Rebecca, we should go. I think so. Goodnight. Hello? Hey, Jeff. It's Stan. That guy you were lookin' for? Yeah, Rodney Emerson. Yeah. He just came by to pick up his paycheck and I got a local address for him. Hey, thanks, Stan. Uh, could you text it to me? You got it. Okay. No laceration, but you have a heck of a contusion. Well I woulda ran the guy down, but it's a bit harder when you're seein' double. You shouldn't have even been here without back up. Couldn't let him get away. It seems like he did. Fair point. This will help reduce swelling. Quite the bedside manner you got there, Doc. Is that how you take care of people back in New York? They're better behaved. So, how'd you get into that business anyway? Um. Well growing up, it was just me and my dad. And... We took care of each other. It just got to be something I was good at and something I enjoyed. There's a lot of people who need taking care of in New York. And I needed a change. And what brought you back? It was a different kind of change. Very mysterious. Whatever you say, detective. JW. You okay? Oh, he'll be just fine. Anything in there that might help us find this guy? I'm afraid not. But I just heard from the station. Lloyd Prajna's neighbor called in a tip. Lloyd is back home. Well let's go pay him a visit. Yeah. Hey, thanks. Anytime. Hi, Lloyd. Remember me? I'm Chief Madeiras. This is Jeff Jackson. We'd like to ask you some questions. Yeah? What about? Willard Gilford? Willard sent you over her to hassle me? Doesn't he have better things to do? - Not anymore. - Whoa. Lloyd. Willard Gilford is dead. Oh and you think I had something to do with it? You had an altercation with Britt and Willard at the Pendray. Night of the event. Hey, look, I. I was just upset about the brooch. Okay? I had fair claim to it. And Willard was the only one standin' in your way. Hey, I wouldn't kill him. Where have you been since the event? I was out. On a friend's boat. What's your friend's name? Sam. Something. Look, I just met the guy, okay? And, unless I'm being charged with something, I'd really just like to catch up on some sleep. Do you know this guy? Nope. And you don't know anything about the missing brooch? If I knew something about the five million dollar emerald brooch, do you think I'd still be here? Don't make any vacation plans, Lloyd. Is that how you do things in Boston? Not typically. I'm not a cop. Fair enough. Good idea. Text me that, will ya? You got it. This car could be a match to cousin Lloyd's. Same size, same shape. Well, so are half the cars on the island. I'm waiting on a warrant to search the property, including his car. Chief, got somethin'! The keypads were pulled and exposed, but they weren't hacked. Whoever did it used a code. But Britt and Chelsea are the only ones with the access codes. This time code here matches the time when Britt put the brooch in the safe. So, that's Britt's code. Just like all these used before it. Except that one. The last code used. It's different. Someone had a master code. A back door into the safe that nobody else knew about. Right. Now, the fingerprint reader, itself, was clean, so we couldn't pull an actual print off of it. But when it's scanned, the print creates a date file. So like the access code, the last one used is different than all the other ones. So, a print and the codes are different than Britt and Chelsea's, but they still worked. But why would a burglar rip out the keypads if he could bypass them with a code? To make it look like he couldn't. There's somethin' else. This is the security footage from the night of the event. I matched two camera angles. That's Rebecca Lane. Yeah, and she's talkin' to Emerson. Print that for me. Let's take a field trip to the Vineyard Art Museum. Ah, wonderful. Thank you. Oh. Something tells me, um, you aren't here to enjoy our art. Hi. Hello, Chief. Can you tell us what you know about this man, Ms. Lane? Um, not, not a lot. You two look friendly. Well, he was working the event. His name is... Rodney something. Emerson. That's right. I was introduced to him by Victor Gaines. How does Victor know him? Just an associate from Boston. That's all he said. Well, thanks for your time Ms. Lane. Of course. If she's telling the truth, that means Victor Gaines knows Rodney Emerson. Well, Victor Gaines was expecting a nice percentage from the Lakshmi emerald's auction. Which got completely pulled out from under him. Maybe he's the big time guy behind the small-time thief, Emerson. Either way, Victor Gaines knows more than he's lettin' on. You read my article? Yeah. Yeah, it was good. You know, I actually wanted to offer you a lead on another story. I'm all ears. Willard Gilford's dead. Autopsy says induced heart attack. Likely after some kind of violent interrogation. Yeah, that's... - Horrible? Yeah. Obviously, you should talk to the chief and Dr. Madeiras if you want any official statements. Jeff. You know I don't burn my sources, but... Circumstances have changed. Meaning? Willard Gilford was my source on the stolen brooch. Huh. Because he's the one who stole it. So you think Willard stole the brooch? Britt told us that he advised her on all the upgrades to the Pendray. And it makes sense that he would have a master code and a thumbprint to get into the safe. Yeah, but why would he betray her like that? That I don't know. She was released this morning. We need to go tell her. My grandfather was particularly proud of his work in preserving the North Cove Lighthouse. It's now a museum in his honor. Oh, I'll have to go and visit. Yes, I could give you a tour. Thanks, Britt. I have to say I was surprised to hear from you after what's happened. Well, that's actually the reason I called. Everything is being sensationalized and I just, um. I'm so sorry. Can we continue this another time? That's no problem, I... Mr. Jackson. Mr. And Mrs. Fields. This is Dr. Zee Madeiras. Yes. Saw you the other night at the event. Yeah, that's right. Which feels like a lifetime ago. Any luck locating the emeralds? Not yet. 'Scuse us. Uh, AJ, my friends, Zee and Jeff. AJ is writ... Writing the magazine feature, I remember. Nice to meet you, Jeff? Yeah. Thank you again, Britt. And I will take you up on that offer to tour the lighthouse. Definitely. What now? Let's take a walk. That. No, no. That makes no sense. It's absurd to think he stole the brooch. Britt. Willard's the one who advised you to install the new security system, right? Yes, but. Didn't he have a master code? Can't something like that be hacked? Well, yes, but, we know it wasn't. I just. If it was him, then someone made him do it against his will. That's the only explanation. Do you think it might be possible that someone made him do it? Like Britt said? Maybe. Willard's not just gonna give up the brooch. Which would explain why he was tied up and interrogated. His killer wasn't trying to find out where Britt was keeping the brooch, but where Willard had hidden it. Hm. Begs a million dollar question. Sorry. Slow day. No. What is the million dollar question, Bob? Did Willard reveal where the brooch was hidden before he died? I think we should take a closer look inside Willard's house. Maybe it's been there the whole time. Geez. So this is how the other half lives. Wow. Looks like someone else thought the emerald would be here. Yep. Chief. JW. I just talked to Lloyd Prajna's neighbor. He left with a packed bag 20 minutes ago. Looks like he's skipping town. Got O'Connor going to the airport. You're closer to the ferry. Can you get there? Yeah. We're leavin' Willard's now. All right. Hey, Zee. We gotta go. What's going on? There he is. Stay here. Lloyd? Lloyd. Lloyd. Lloyd. Get outta the way. Lloyd! Lloyd. Lloyd. Listen, Lloyd. My back's killin' me. So I really don't wanna fight you. But I'm pretty sure I'd win. What do you say? You done? Come on. Go. Are you okay to drive? Yeah. Just flarin' up a little. Hey, Jeff. What happened that night? What night? You know what night. What happened was that my partner and I got into a fire fight with a suspect. 38 special. That's what we call them. 'Cause you kill with a 38. We were trackin' him for a while. My partner and I both got hit. But only one of us died. Now, you prepare for it, but you never really prepare for it. And one thing's for sure. I've got a 38 caliber slug in my back to make sure I never forget. A 38? Are you sure that's what you were shot with? I mean, yeah. That's... That's what the perp carried. Why? When you first came to see me, the x-ray of your back did not show a 38. What are you talkin' about? Whatever's in your back is a different caliber bullet. Are you sure? I'd bet my career on it. 'Cause that would mean... That would mean there was a second shooter that night. I think it's possible that whoever actually shot you is still out there. It's a simple question. Why did you run? I'm not gonna say anything without my attorney present. How'd you get that cut on your hand, Lloyd? Breaking into Willard's house? Ah... torn... ey. So Lloyd isn't talking. Yet. You think he did it? Well, he's definitely hiding something. How do you know? People tend to deflect when they have something to hide. Huh. Like you. Like me? Outside Emerson's place. When I asked you what brought you back to the island, you dodged the question. That must mean... That it's personal. I came back because of a guy. A guy? Mm hm. A guy who was my fiancee. You were engaged? Mm hm. So? What happened? Well. Um. It's Willard's toxicology report. Okay, so, in addition to taking nitro glycerine, he was also taking angiotensin receptor blockers. His heart was giving out. So he didn't have long to live. No. Why would someone steal a priceless brooch if they aren't even gonna be around long enough to enjoy the benefits? The last thing that Willard said, was that he would do anything for Britt. Right, so. And he made it look like a burglary, not an inside job. So he could throw the suspicion from himself. Unless, he staged it to look like a burglary. So people thought the brooch was actually stolen. To protect Britt. By stealing from her? Remember how upset he was that night at the hospital? I mean, Britt could've been killed. The brooch was putting her life in danger. But if people thought it was gone forever, she'd never be at risk. Right. So, to be sure she would never be at risk, he told Jackie Shawl about the burglary that night. So she would run with the story right away. Yeah, it actually makes sense. What I don't understand is why he wouldn't just tell her before he did it. Again, to protect her. So she wouldn't be implicated in a crime. We have to talk to Britt tomorrow. Yeah. Tell her the potentially good news about Willard. And the potentially very bad news about Lloyd. That makes so much sense about Willard. And it means the key to finding his killer is finding that brooch. But I gotta tell ya, I find it hard to believe Lloyd would. I mean, I know he's unpleasant, but I don't think he's a murderer. Hello, everyone. Hi. Sorry to intrude. We're just so glad to see you're up and about. But deeply sorry to hear about Mr. Gilford. He was a lovely man. It's shocking. Thank you. There been any leads? Any closer to finding out who did it? The investigation's ongoing. Well, if there's anything we can do, please let us know. It'll have to be over the phone, though. We're on the way to the ferry now. I thought you mentioned you'd be staying on the island the next couple of weeks. That was our original plan. Unfortunately, there's some pressing business that needs my attention. Ah. Well, safe travels. Thank you. Take care. Bye. Hey. I assumed you asked me to meet you so you could give me another scoop? No scoops. Just yet. I asked you to meet me because I could use your help. Hm. I'm listening. When you covered the Lakshmi event, did you get any background on Freddy and Regina Fields? Freddy Fields comes from a very wealthy family. A known art collector, he recently offloaded several pieces, but nothing nearly as valuable as the Lakshmi emeralds. His wife, Regina, runs a nonprofit, has been honored for philanthropy. So, by all accounts, good people. Maybe. What about Victor Gaines? Seemed pretty straight forward. Two newsworthy auctions, but, nothing notable in his personal history. I wanna know more about Gaines and Associates. You have anybody back in Boston who could dig into 'em? Could make a few calls. I'd owe you one. Yeah, you really are running a tab. I'm good for it. Oh, my grandmother loved attention. The parties and the headlines. I mean, she was that way until she died. Quite the character. I think that's why we had so much fun together. Yeah, she really knew how to make life interesting. Mm hm. Wonderful. I'd like to offer my condolences for Mr. Gilford. Thank you. He had spent quite some time tracking down the emeralds, no? Yeah, hee did. He was happy to finally bring them back here. It's where my grandmother would've wanted them. Yes, he had told me the story of when they were originally stolen. The curse catching up with him. Yeah, that was a story he really liked to tell. Did Willard put any credence in the curse? No, not really. It's just that, with the history of the brooch, it doesn't seem so far-fetched. I'm sorry. How do you mean? Well, the attempt in Boston and the attack on you, Britt. The theft of the emeralds here and, now, Mr. Gilford's death. Yeah, but the curse can't be real. Who can say? You know what? Why don't we take a break? Of course. We'll finish this another time. How's Britt holdin' up? She's fine. We actually just met with AJ Sharma, the writer from the Culture India magazine. How was that? Um, I mean, she loves talking about her grandmother, but he just kept bringing up Willard. And it seems like he's obsessed with the curse. You think that's just a story angle? I mean, I feel like I'm being paranoid ever since the brooch came on the island. Zee, you and I both know curses don't exist. It's Jackie Shawl. Asked her to run something down for me. Hey, Jackie. Ten years ago, Victor Gaines was charged with attempting to sell stolen jewels on the black market. How come it didn't show up on his record? His lawyer had it expunged. Buried it. One of my contacts dug it up. I'm gonna email it to you right now. Yeah, thanks. Looks like we need to have another conversation with Victor Gaines. Hi. We're looking for a guest by the name of Victor Gaines. Thanks. I have some more questions for you, Mr. Gaines. Can this be brief? I have somewhere to be. When I saw you at the Pendray bar, you told me you have no knowledge of trading on the black market. But ten years ago, you were charged with smuggling jewels out of Europe. Those charges were dropped. Yeah, because the key witness died two days before the trial. That's awfully convenient for you. As a matter of fact, it was quite inconvenient. Can you explain? I was innocent. If the case had gone to trial, I would have been completely exonerated. When the witness died, the prosecution decided to drop the case, but the damage to my reputation had been done. Now, if that's all. That's not all. What can you tell me about your friend Rodney Emerson? Who? The waiter you introduced Rebecca Lane at the event. Ah, yes, of course. It was a surprise to run into Rodney. He did some janitorial work at my building. At the auction house? Yes. That's right. Now, if we're done, I really must go. What's your intuition telling you? That was a total waste of time. How about yours? Redire ad fontem. Huh? Latin? It means return to the source. Rebecca Lane is connected to Gaines who's connected to Emerson. But who connects them both to the brooch? Willard Gilford. Yes. Hey, wait a second. What? What do you think about tracing this from the thief's perspective? Oh, okay. Come on. Yeah. So he breaks this window, lets himself in. Right. But with what? I mean, there's nothin' here. Wait a second. What is it? It's a piece of flashing that protects the glass. Must've got jarred loose when the window was broken. I didn't notice it before. Wait, that's blood. So, he broke the window with his hand. And who do we know that has a cut on their hand? I want to remind you that my client is here voluntarily. Your client is here because his blood was found on the smashed door at Willard Gilford's estate. The same estate that we found Willard's dead body. Maybe he was there to try to cover up some evidence? You have nothing connecting him... Oh, no, it's okay. I had heard the rumors Gilford stole the brooch. When he was found dead without the brooch, I thought, maybe he might've hidden it somewhere in his house. So you broke in? All I did was go in and look around, okay? I don't know anything about the theft of the brooch. I don't know anything about Gilford's murder. Then we'll be holding you on the breaking and entering until that proves to be true. What if I have information? Like what? I want a deal. We can do what we can. That guy you're lookin' for. Emerson. Rodney Emerson. I started following Victor Gaines around after Gilford turned up dead. He's chartered a boat. Down in Vineyard Haven harbor. Why were you following him? I knew he was close to Gilford. I thought he might lead me to the brooch. Well how does this relate to Emerson? I saw that Emerson guy hangin' around Victor's boat. Rodney Emerson. Police. Martha's Vineyard police. Come on out. Chief. Rodney Emerson? Yep. If Victor's trying to clean up his mess, why leave a dead Emerson on a boat he rented? Maybe because Victor's not the one who killed him. I'd say he hasn't been dead very long. Maybe two, three hours. Does that look familiar? Yes it does. Same wounds we found on Willard. So now the Gazette peddles in gossip? It wasn't my article, Jeff. I promise you, whatever I write about this story will be the whole truth. You have to trust me. Do I? Look. I don't know where this goes, but it's more background on Victor Gaines. Maybe there's something there. I'll let you know what I find. Okay. Foreclosure? That's six months before the auction. Hey. Guess what the burn marks are from? What? A stun gun. The measurement between the two marks, on both Willard and Emerson, match the most common type of stun gun. Odd weapon of choice for a killer. Did you figure something out? Maybe. But we need a confession. And for that, we need to find those emeralds. How? Redire ad fontem. Come on, let's take a drive. Hey, you find something? The Lakshmi emeralds. And look. Oh, Willard's boat. Willard's note to Britt. "Let the brooch be buried in the annals of time." He had a way with words. We need to get on that boat. Um. Um. He's at pier four at the marina. Are these the keys to the Annals of Time? Pretty good. There she is. Now, I must've been on this boat dozen of times when I was younger and I just never knew what the annals of time meant. Really? I always thought you were a know-it-all back in high school. No. I just knew more than you. Permission to come on board? Granted. Let's see. Ladies first. So where would you hide a brooch? Willard using the word buried makes me think it's under our feet. Like a trap door. Under a Persian rug. What do we have here? Jackpot. Hey, Chelsea. Is Britt here? Uh, nope. She took off about fifteen minutes ago. Oh. She's already at the lighthouse. Well let's head over there. Hello, Zee. Hi. We're just running to the lighthouse. Do you wanna ride with us? The lighthouse? Yeah, you're meeting Britt there. Am I? Come on. Let's go. AJ? AJ? Voicemail. Britt always answers her phone. Chief, get a unit out to the North Cove Lighthouse. We're on our way. I don't wanna have to use this on you again. Just tell me where Willard put the brooch. I don't. I don't know. He had to have told you. I swear. He didn't. He didn't. Please. Gaines isn't our guy, Chief. But while lookin' into him, I found some interesting information on the Fields. Jeff found a public notice that the Fields were days away from having their assets seized. They're in massive debt to the IRS. They needed the money from the sale of that brooch. Regina said she'd been mugged twice outside of her Brownstone, but that she'd taken precautions. According to the local paper, she foiled the second mugging with a stun gun. That's what was used on both Willard and Emerson. Okay, we're on our way. Hold off until we get there. Wait. Jeff, shouldn't we wait for back up? Britt could be dead by then. Come on. Britt? Britt? Stay here. Wait. Wait. Wait. We just wanna talk. If you wanna live, you'll get your friend Britt to do the same. Leave it. Help her up. Let's talk. Like you said. Come on, get up the stairs. Move. Both of you. Britt. Over there. The police are on their way. They know what happened. And that it was you. You're accomplice Rodney Emerson was casin' the hotel to steal the brooch. When he saw Willard cut the power. And why would Willard do that, huh? Unless he intended to steal the brooch for himself. The three of you went to Willard's to search the place. But he wouldn't give up the brooch, would he? We just. We were trying to get him to tell us where he'd hidden it. He had a bad heart. We didn't know that. We didn't mean to... Kill him? Well you did. That's grand theft and homicide. Double homicide, if you count Emerson. And now you can add kidnapping to the charges. Why did you take Britt? He had to have told her where he had hidden it. He didn't, I swear. Actually, Britt, he did. His note he sent you with the flowers? You mean about Clifford Moncrief? He said the brooch was buried in the annals of time. You remember Willard's sailboat? Oh my gosh. - Of course. - What are you babbling about? The Annals of Time. His boat. And guess what we found buried in it? What? Hey, hey, hey... Easy. It's in my pocket. Give it here. Untie Britt first. Do it, Regina. Do it. Hey, that's close enough. It's okay, Freddy. What do you think I'm gonna do? You're the one with the gun. All I have is a five million dollar brooch that you killed to get. So. Here you go. Stay back. Both of you. Back up. On the ground. Both of you. Now. What have you done? What have you done? The Fields confirm they met Emerson at Victor's auction house. And they killed him, because he was trying to go to Victor. Probably to give them up. Ironic that they brought me here. Willard always called this place a light in the darkness. Britt. You still have that card Willard sent you? Uh. We need to go back to the hotel. Come on. Willard loved word games. And this note is basically a riddle. All coded language. Now, Zee and I were able to figure out the first part. About the brooch being hidden in the boat. But we also suspected that they wouldn't be the real Lakshmi emeralds. Wait, you mean... Willard told you that the brooch would be buried in the annals of time. And after that, there's this odd line about how, "You need to discard the transient and seek the true." And transient had to be code for the fake brooch. That's what you threw into the ocean? So then, where are the real Lakshmi emeralds? For that, you have to return to the works of Clifford Moncrief. They are a light in the darkness. As soon as I heard you say that up at the lighthouse, I remembered where I saw the name Clifford Moncrief. In the confusion after he cut the power, Willard must have hid the brooch here. In the lighthouse. They never left the hotel. You're incredible. Oh my gosh. Hey. Hi. Is that? Just a gift of my homemade tartar sauce. Oh, it smells so good. Chef Jeff. Batter. And did you chill these before you battered them? You know, just because I wasn't born here doesn't mean I can't learn. Okay, we're doing a blind taste test. As soon as those clams are done. Bring it, Madeiras. So, uh, you never finished telling me. You know, about your engagement. Well. After the invitations went out. We were gonna do it at the Pendray, of course. I found out that I wasn't the only woman in his life. And it almost destroyed me. Until I decided it just didn't have to. And that this island is my home. And he wasn't welcome on it. Good for you. Here's a towel. Rookie move. Oh no. How do we do this? Um, you close your eyes. Seriously? You close your eyes. You are not to be trusted. Come on. It's a blind taste test. I can get a blindfold. No, no, no, no. It's fine. I'll close my eyes. Right now, all right? Mm. Okay. - I'm ready for the next one. - Okay. Mm. Well, I think. Clearly. Beyond a shadow of a doubt. They were both yours. No. Yes. You tried to fake me out. You tried to fake me out. But I know my tartar sauce. Busted.
