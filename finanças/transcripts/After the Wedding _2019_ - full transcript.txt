What kind of bird is that? Why don't you sit up with the others and meditate, and you can imagine all the birds you want. I don't want to close my eyes today. Want to help me ring the bell? Okay, here you go, hand these out. Good job. Give them some pongal. What did you get? Nice to see you too. What is this? Where's the food, the beds, school supplies? That's all I could get for the money. So where's the money? They want you to meet with them in New York. “What? To tell them why we are a worthy cause. - How many hoops do we have to jump through? - It's their money. I won't teach them about compassion when the kids need me here, - so tell them to save the goddamn whales. - They want to give us $2 million. Look at his pants. He's a baby. He peed his bed. Gget out of here! - Hey! Hey! Hey! - Stop it! I hate you! Stop! Jal, jai, jal, it's okay. It's okay. Can you get me some sheets? It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay. I'm here. I'm right here. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. I'm right here, okay? I'm not leaving him. Do you hear me? I do. Why don't I go to new York and meet with them? You could fill me in, and I could take them through it. It's on my way to Argentina. Sort of. Yes. I understand. Of course. It has to be you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Ta-ta. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Check on him every night. We were here long before god brought you to us, Isabel. I'm not coming back without a suitcase full of money. Bye. Hey, guys. What's up? Tanya, you don't have to sell them on it. Just walk them through it. Give them all the information they need. What else? Yeah, well, then we're gonna need bill on the call. Can somebody shoot him an e-mail? You know what? If you can't get him tonight, then let's do this tomorrow because I don't want to go through it twice. Okay? Gwen, can you stay on the line? Will you get bill first thing tomorrow and then get me”? Okay. Okay. Well, is Cahill at home or at the office? Will you text me her cell, please? Okay. I'm finished for the night. Bye-bye. Chickens! Little chickens! Hi, dusty. Hi. - Oh, what are you doing? - Hi, mom. You know I don't like that game. - But dad said we could. - Dad said we could. He did? Well, mommy's home now, okay? Just five more minutes. - Yeah. - I don't think so. And 40007? Cycle through them. Hi, bunny. Hi, daddy. Nothing. Just getting married this weekend. Yeah, I heard. - Not that big a deal. - Grace! Milly bought us a round of shots. Sounds like you're having fun over there. Kind of. Hey, grace? Yeah? It's gonna be perfect, okay? Your mom's got everyone working at maximum efficiency. Thank you, daddy. How's the show coming? You know, work in progress. Thanks for asking. I just... I wanted to call and say hi. I love you, Gracie. I love you too. Okay. Bye. Congratulations! - We love you, grace! - I love you. "The expression on his face changed rapidly from fear to sadness to anger. 'Who are you, boy? Did you draw these pictures?' Hugo didn't answer him. 'I said, did you draw these pictures? Hugo growled again and spit on the floor. 'Who did you steal this notebook from?" ' Didn't steal it!" What is wrong with the boys? Why are they reading? Hey, did you tell them that they can play that killing-each-other-in-outer-space game? Lords of domination? Maybe. - So how does it look? - I don't know. It's never quite like I imagine. No, it's gonna be great. The work is beautiful. You should just relax and try to enjoy it. And Gracie called. I think she was looking for some reassurance. She sounded nervous. Guess it runs in the family. - Are you feeling nervous? - Are you nervous? - Are you nervous? - Are you nervous? - One second. I'm getting a call. - Are you nervous? - How's it going? She can't talk now. - No. - She's feeling nervous. - Stop tickling me. - Don't. No! No, no, no! - Does this make you nervous? - Who's nervous now? - Do not... oh, my god! No, no, no. How'd they respond to the retention period? That's not gonna work for me. We can give on the deferred compensation, but the retention period is nonnegotiable, okay? All right. Look, I'm walking the dog, so I'll call you back when I get in the car. Thanks. Dusty, what are you doing? No, no, no. Don't eat that. Miss andersen, welcome to New York. We're so happy you'll be staying with us at the hotel. Right this way. This is our 14th-floor penthouse suite. It's 1000 square feet with a 650 square-foot terrace. There's a carrara marble bathroom with a deep soaking tub and a rainfall shower. This is your cell phone. There's a car at your disposal. My number and the driver's are both programmed. Anything that I can do to make your stay more comfortable, please don't hesitate to ask. Isabel? Yes? I'm Jonathan. I'm here to take you to your meeting. Oh, okay. How's the hotel? You comfortable? Yes. Good. I chose it myself. Have you ever met Theresa? No. She's very impressive. She built horizon from nothing 22 years ago, and now it's the biggest media placement company in the United States. It sounds like you know her well. I've worked at the company for four years. And she's my mother-in-law. Or will be, on Saturday. Marrying her daughter. Congratulations. Thanks. How long will you be away? Just a week. - Will you be back for my birthday? - I don't miss birthdays, jai. There's free ice cream. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry. They're almost finished. - But I keep telling them... - Christine? Christine, the valuation potentially changes if it leaks into next quarter. Can I get you a water? - Means conceding a few points, and that's fine with me. - No, thank you. Okay, but I think the original number is... I'm sorry. Can you excuse me one moment? Tanya and I will call you back with suggestions. Yes, that's great. And I've got to go. I'll talk to you later. I don't know why we hired someone to guide us through this process who we now need to guide. She's been through this with other companies, so that's valuable. Can we think about renegotiating her fee? We're doing most of the work here. - Okay? Hi. - Okay. Okay. I am so sorry to keep you waiting. You must be Isabel. - Yes. - I'm Theresa. - Theresa, it's so nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. It's so clear today that you can see New Jersey. I don't know why you'd want to though. Let's go to my office. Please, come in, sit down. You must be exhausted. I'm fine, really. “What's the time difference? - Nine hours. Thank you. - Here, have a seat. So I watched the video my group brought back from India. What's really going on there just can't be understood through a video. I think it gave a pretty good sense. There are over 200,000 child prostitutes in the south alone. Five times that number suffer from malnutrition. Those numbers increase when you get into the bigger cities. Hundreds of thousands die from minor illnesses and infections, completely preventable and for very little money, if someone had the inclination. - Because it's preventable. - I'm so sorry to interrupt. I have the caterers on the line. They want to know if they can use mussels and shrimp in the Risotto. There's a lobster shortage. Is there a lobster shortage, or can they not get enough lobster? I'm not sure. Will you find out? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about that. You just caught me at a very busy time. My daughter's getting married this weekend. - I met your son-in-law. - Yeah, Jonathan. Well, grace says she's in love and she's ready to get married, and... I could fight her, and tell her she's too young and that she doesn't know what she's doing. And have her hate me forever, or... I could give her a beautiful wedding. Do you have kids? No. Partner? No, my work is all-consuming. Yeah, I get it, it's a lot. It's really a lot to manage both. I just always wanted both, so I worked hard at it. I have twin boys too. I worked hard to get them, believe me. So we do have a list of priorities, if you're interested in seeing that. Okay. What we'd like to do is take in three times the number of kids. - Okay. - Change our food program, subsidize, buy from local farmers, vaccinate... Which can be done for under $5 per child. This is... It's great. It's very, very impressive... - Thank you. - The work you're doing. I feel I need a little more time to explore this. There are a lot of very deserving organizations out there. What? I'm sorry, I was under the impression that you had already decided to be involved. If you look at the information there, you can see that the need is undeniable. Clearly. I just have a big weekend ahead of me. So leave all this with me, we'll have lunch on Monday and I'll tell you what I can do. In the meantime, come to the wedding. We can get to know each other better. - I have a flight to India. - Staying the weekend won't kill you. Gwen? Gwen? Can you get Isabel an invitation to the wedding? Right away. And you won't be uncomfortable, I promise you. It's just a big party. It'll be fun. Dr. Cahill is here for the insurance workup. - Send her in. - I need a physical? No, it's not for you. It's for me. Got a lot of hoops to jump through to sell your company. Thank you so much. Thank you. What a pleasure to meet you. - Thank you so much for your time. - I'll see you tomorrow. Okay? - The style is just classic. Allow me to show you. - Right. I understand your reticence. Let's go. Time is money. Chop-chop. Come on. Come on. I see one swan here. I need to see three. I et's do this. Come on. - Let's go. You, sir, side door, please. - Yeah, they got the lobster. - Easy, easy. - What? What'd you do? I nixed the ice sculpture, and Melinda's having a fit. Sir, could we hurry it up? Thank you. It's probably not the time to tell her that we need another chair. - Come on. Time is money. Let's go! - I invited somebody from work. Maybe... I just won't tell her and put it in after, when she leaves. - Where's grace? - Is she gonna leave? - She's in the back. - Okay. You got this? Okay. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Hi. So if you could just wrap them around the tree? And then, also, more just hanging down a foot. But, yeah, I'll be right back, okay? - The chairs are too slanted. - I told you. How you doing? Doing okay? Yeah. Any doubts? - You wish. - No. I wish what you wish. Thank you. I don't know why you can't live together for a while though. - Really? - And he's not as good-looking as you. You went there. That's nice. Is there anything else? You'll always be mine, remember that. God, you're honestly the worst. You're the worst. Can you just, like, try before the wedding to get all of your crying out? - Yeah, I will. - It sets me off. You set me off. Okay. - I have to go. I'm so busy. I have so many things to do. - Me too. - I have chairs to un-slant and stuff like that. - Oh, my god. What? That's awesome! Yeah, it's big. It's big, but it's also small. All the buildings are squeezed together in these really small, little spaces. Are there birds? Yeah, there's birds. But they're different from what we're used fo. When will you be back? As soon as I can. I want you to set a good example for the others while I'm gone. Okay. Will you put preena on the phone? Okay. Goodbye, miss Isabel. Bye, jai. So? What do you think? I think we could get 100 beds for what they're paying for this hotel suite. I hope this wasn't too good to be true. - I'm not coming back without a suitcase full of... - A suitcase full of money, I know. Can I call you back? Excuse me. What's...? What's going on here? Miss young thought you might need a dress. For the wedding. - Mom, please. - Sorry. You look beautiful, honey. You've told me that. Like, a lot. Because it's true, you do. - You look really beautiful. - Thank you. Grace and Jonathan, today you're here to engage in a shared path. Life will throw you its ups and downs... Be patient with each other, knowing that change happens slowly and gradually. Seek inspiration from your family and friends. To make this relationship work will take love. This is the core of your marriage and why you are here today. It will take trust to know that in your hearts you truly want what's best for each other. It will take dedication to stay open to one another, and to learn and grow together. It will take faith to go forward together without knowing exactly what the future brings. It will take commitment to hold to the journey that you've both pledged to today. Rings, please. Thank you. Grace and Jonathan, it is my humble honor and divine pleasure to pronounce you husband and wife. Congratulations! So this one of his sculptures? Yeah, he made it for them. It's an original piece. “Wonderful. Thank you. And... Because it's a special occasion, you may have them, but before dinner... - But tonight you enjoy. - You enjoy. Good. All right? - Mom said... - Oh, yeah. No, we need a picture. - We got to go. Picture. - Graciel! - Get in here, honey. - A little bit more that way? - Yeah, this way. She wants to get the light right. - Okay. She's an artist. - Perfect. - Everybody smile. Thank you. - How about you with your parents? - Okay. So, what do you say? All right. All right, perfect. - Cheers! - Cheers! What are you doing here? Hi. Good, you made it. I was a little bit late. I missed the first part. The traffic. We were stuck... That's okay. You're here now. That's all that matters. You met my husband? Yeah? So Isabel runs an orphanage in India that I'm thinking of funding. Yeah. I thought it'd be nice if she could come. Yeah. Mom, should I change my dress before dinner? No, because people like to see the bride in her beautiful dress. It looks so good. This is our daughter, grace. This is Isabel. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - It's a beautiful dress. - Let's double-check that playlist before it starts. - Okay? Cool. Hey! - Yeah, sure. - I'm glad you could make it. - Thank you for having me. - Let's get a picture. - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. All right. Here we go. - Oh, dad. Come on. - All together. Tight. - No, you. - Oh, Isabel, you too. - Yeah. - Tight, tight. - Come on, let's do it. - Perfect. And... Perfect. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Let's go party like it's 2019. Get in there. Have fun. You too. Come on. - Don't be shy. - Yes. Everybody. I want to make sure that you get some candids too, all right? - Oatmeal. - Hamburgers. I'm on this paleo thing. Training for a tri in Hawaii on the big island. Hi. Hello. I want to welcome you all. I thought the saying "I do" part would be the hardest. When I started working for Theresa, I thought I was just getting a great job for one of the most forward-thinking entrepreneurs I had ever read about. But very quickly, I came to dread coming in to work. It wasn't my boss's fault. Well, sort of, it was. You see, two years ago, grace started coming in with Theresa. She was working in the design department for the summer. She's an amazing artist, for those of you who don't know. Yeah, we know! Anyway... I saw them coming through the lobby, these two beautiful, powerful women, and I froze. - Which one is he in love with? - But I spent the next month doing everything I could to just be in the same place at the same time as grace. And, finally, I braved an elevator ride with her. Do you remember my genius banter? "What floor?" Yeah, it was not good. Until one day, - I got lucky. - Hey! All right, not like that. We were in standing line at the company pub. She was in front of me. And she had forgotten her wallet. So I paid. And it was the best $14 that I ever spent. Grace, I love you more than anything. And I couldn't be happier that you agreed to marry me. All right! It's gonna be a fun honeymoon. Hi. Hi. You're not quite free yet. Jonathan, I love you. And I'm so happy to be your wife. I can't believe I can say that now. But this this speech isn't for you. It's for my mom and dad. Dad. I don't know a girl who is closer to her father than I am with you. And I am so grateful for that... Most of the time. I've gotten so much from you. My sulking. And my sense of humor. Unfortunately, my nose. And thank you for the beautiful sculpture. Yeah. I don't know if it's grace and me or grace and her dad. - Jonathan. - I'm kidding, of course. Absolutely. Mom. You've made this night so special. You are... The most caring, loving, best example of a woman I could have ever asked for in a mother. Thank you. And for those of you who don't know, I had the rare experience of getting to choose my own mother. It was just me and my dad for the first year of my life. My dad and I went everywhere together, with me strapped to his chest. And one day, we were walking down the street in soho, and this... This beautiful woman with bright red hair had just moved to the neighborhood. I guess we looked like locals, so she asked if we knew of a place to get a good cup of coffee. And what did you say? "I don't drink coffee. I don't know." Right. Yeah. And that would have been that, except I grabbed hold of her hair and I wouldn't let her go. Mom, I'm so happy that I chose you. To my parents, for this wonderful life and this beautiful night. - Right. - Cheers. Cheers! - Cheers! - We're toasting. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. I couldn't agree more. I am not into weddings. - I'd like to be alone. - Tell me about it. Crowds are awful. Okay, I can take one for the team and drink them both. You know how at every wedding, there's always a few single people well... We're those people. It's weird, right”? I'm divorced. What's your story? Get away from me. Okay. Excuse me. I think I need some sodas or something. - What did you do? - Fireworks time! Let's head down to the beach and continue this party! - I can't talk to you about this right now. - Dad! Oscar! The fireworks! I'm... Isabel, I'm gonna call you tomorrow. Oh, my gosh. I didn't know. I didn't know it was her. Let's see what they got us. It's just two lines: "Here's to the year. Here's to an extra special anniversary." - I think it's a blanket? - Maybe. - What do you think, grace? - I think it's a tablecloth. Oh, yeah? I think it's a cape. Yeah. 'Whatever it is, it's nice. - It's a cape, right? - It's from one of our lawyers. - Sorry. - Does it have a return receipt? Might be a matching hat in there. - Somebody's at the door. - Hold on. - Was there anything else in there? - No, just some of this. Please come in. Wait here, okay? I'm gonna do something with it. I'm gonna go. Should we start with the flamingos? Or should we start...? - Hey. - Gonna go with this one. Who made this? Did you make this? Hi. - Hi. - Isabel, right? Thank you for coming yesterday. Thanks for having me. - I told you that I would call you. - But you didn't. - Can I get you something to drink? - No. Why don't we show you around? Yeah. Is everything okay? Yeah. Everything's fine. But keep opening presents because otherwise we'll be here all week. Okay. What do you want? I want to know why my daughter... Is in the other room. How do you live with yourself? A lot more easily than if I had left her with someone else to raise. So how did that even happen? Because... because we decided that we couldn't keep the baby. - No, you decided. - No, you agreed. No, no, no. I was a kid. Exactly. We decided to give her up for adoption because we decided that was the best thing for her. - Isabel, we tried to find you. We... - No, you didn't. You didn't. If you'd wanted to find me, you could have found me. You wanted to be the hero. Oh, don't talk to her like that! You didn't want to be found. You ran the second they let you out of the hospital. You're goddamn right I did. You know how painful that decision was to make. You were there. I don't remember it being that hard. Or if it was, you didn't tell me. You just shut down. You turned into some zombie. So that gives you the right to raise her behind my back because I was conflicted about being a mother when I was 18 years old? "Conflicted"? You went crazy. One second, telling me what a great life we were gonna have, - the next, how you wanted to kill yourself. - I never said that. - You did. - I never said that! - You said it to my face! - I never said that! All right, all right, calm down. Please, quiet. Hey. Come on. It's all good. Please don't do that. Why didn't you tell me you were gonna keep her? I didn't know until after you were gone, and by then, it was too late. And I couldn't find you. I'm not gonna justify myself to you. I don't owe you anything. You tell her, or I will. At every moment, I made the best decision that I could. It was very complicated, grace. - You just don't understand. - No, you're fucking right. - I don't understand. - Don't curse at me. It was a lot to manage. I did my best. And this... Story... Just kind of developed. Do you think that I made it up on purpose? I didn't want you to know that your mom gave you up, so I told you that she died. Can you not understand that? A little girl. I didn't want you to feel that hurt and that pain. You don't think I feel that anyway? You don't think that I feel incomplete? You had no right to do what you did, and it is not my job to make you feel better about it. And I won't. What hotel? Are you sure you want to do this? You already have a really great mom. Grace, I... I just mean... I'll wait for you. Come in. Please. Can I...? Get you something to drink? We have everything. Yeah, okay. I'll take that. You know what, I have a glass. My dad said that you were dead. Well, I'm not. Yeah. Thanks. What's this...? Taste like? It's like fancy orange soda, I guess. Have a sip. Okay. It's sweet. You don't have this in India? No, we have... Artos. But not so much at the orphanage. I have so many questions. How long are you here for? - Do you have time to meet? - Yeah, of course. - I'd love that. - Okay. I can... I can call you. Now that I know you exist. I can... I can call you too. Yeah. Do...? Do you have a phone? Yeah. Great. Okay. I should go because Jonathan's waiting for me. Okay. Okay. See you. - Okay. - Oh, let me get that for you. - See you. - Bye. I want you to lead the meditation when I'm gone. Would you like that? You can show the others how it's done? Come on, I can teach you. It's easy. Look. Just close your eyes. Close your eyes. There. See, now, but they're not really closed. They're looking on the inside of you, and only you can see that. I see the dark. No, no, really look. You can see everyone that you love. And then with your imagination... You can create anything. And then do you hear the drum? The... That... that is not a drum. No? What's that? That's my heart. I thought this place might remind you of home. That was probably stupid. No, it was thoughtful. Jonathan took me here on one of our first dates. It seemed exotic then. You two seem very happy. Yeah. To tell you the truth, it's kind of hard to think straight about anything right now. Yeah, I know what you mean. Some chutney. Thank you. So do I have any brothers or sisters I don't know about? No. Well... There is this one little boy at the orphanage that I've pretty much raised. We found him by the side of the road when he was just 1. How old is he now? Eight next week. He loves birds. And he... He wants to be a professional football player when he grows up. Soccer, you mean. Soccer! Yes. I brought some photos with me if you want to see them. - I would love that. - Okay. Here. Okay. I et's see. So that's when we went to a ranch... In the summer. Cute. Such a cute kid. Oh, we built a snow fort in the backyard. That's a terrified little reindeer. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That was my birthday. I'm decorating cupcakes. Fun. Yeah. I don't think that I could give up a baby. It wasn't in my plans either. I just knew I couldn't take care of you and that bringing you into the world was the best I could do. That was the first day of third grade. Cibele, there was a nest in my closet. - Did you move it? - A nest? A bird's nest with little blue eggs. - Did you move it? - No, no. - I didn't see that. - You... all right. I do appreciate the interest, but I think I'm gonna hang on to the ap. But I'm happy to show you new stuff I'm working on. And that's cool. But jamey is willing to pay secondary if we could figure out something not totally... - Hey. - Theresa. Jamey, Andre. - They're looking at some of the new stuff. - Did you take that from me? - Oh, yeah. I found it in your closet. - What were you doing in my closet? I was replacing a light bulb. The nest looked like it was falling apart. - I was gonna repair it. - You don't have to fix everything. You're not the handyman. Downside to working at home. I'll show you a sketch of the stuff I'm working on. I want to revisit that. - We will. - All right. Good. Sit down. I'm celebrating. I officially sold my company. - Can we have two more, please? - Of course, miss young. No, thank you. You don't drink? - Not in the middle of the day, no. - Not at the wedding either. Oscar said that you guys partied a lot back in the day. Is that why? Theresa? Just wanted to stop by and say congratulations. - Heard you made out pretty well. - Is that a surprise? Now I'm just a very, very, very rich employee. This is my friend, Isabel. This is Richard and Eddie. I'm about to donate a small fortune to the orphanage Isabel runs in India. - Now I feel bad about myself. - Well, it's about time. - Congratulations again. - Nice to see you. Thanks. I assumed, after the other night, - that that was no longer... - It makes more sense now. We're practically family. We'll have the sole. - You'll love it. - Thank you. - Why are you doing this? - Because I want to. Why can't you just be grateful? Because I know when things seem too good to be true. I think the only thing you need to know is what to do with the money. So it's a good day. A good day for both of us. Was it strange to see Oscar again? I mean, does he look different now? I don't remember. Come on. I mean, he's... He's a good-looking man now, but back then... He must've really been something. You knew who I was when you invited me to come here, didn't you? No, I did not. All I knew is what my people told me, that there was a good charitable opportunity. - I don't believe you. - I don't care. What do you want? - Hi. I'm so sorry to interrupt. - Oh, then why are you? You have your conference call. I tried texting, but you weren't responding. Well, I'm not available now, so push the call. - You specifically asked me to schedule it for Monday. - Jesus Christ. Do I work for you, or do you work for me? - Which one is it? - Iwork for you. Yes, you work for me. So push the fucking call. If you can't, don't come in tomorrow. Thank you. I'm sorry. God, I'm so sorry about that. Grace told me that you two had dinner, and I just wanted to say that I'm glad that's happening. - Gwen dropped these off for you. - Thank you. - She also wanted to see if you're okay. - Yeah, fine. I decided to go ahead and finance Isabel's orphanage. You gonna say anything? I'm sure she'll be very happy about it. You're perfect for each other. - What? - I said, you're perfect for each other. - What is that supposed to mean? - She didn't seem that grateful either. I'm gonna assume that this is the vodka talking. Good solution. No responsibility that way. You know that you're not the only one affected by this, right? - Just don't go up to the boys' room like this. - Don't tell me what to do. And don't tell me how to be a mother because it's not like you're the better parent. And I'm sick and tired of that single-dad story you keep telling... Because you didn't do it on your own. Hi. I want to apologize. I was awful. Hope I didn't scare you. - Oh, it takes more than that. - Please. - Can you tell them I'm gonna be 15 minutes late? - Sure. I have decided to amend my offer. I'd like to make it significantly more generous. It will require you to stay a few more days while the details are being worked out. - No, I can't stay. I have to get home. - I do understand, but the circumstances have changed, and... I think this is too important to be a one-off donation. Obviously, it means a lot to me that you're grace's biological mother, so I have talked to my lawyers about establishing a fund. It would be in both your and grace's name. You would run it together. And I was thinking 20 million over six years. From the research I did, that would cover 50,000 kids a year. For medication, education or housing, whatever you need, including the local farming thing. What's in it for you? Just stay. Just stay a little bit so we can work out the details. You can spend time with grace, get to know her better. I'm gonna take my boys to D.C. for the weekend to see my sister, so why don't you...? Why don't you go out there while I'm gone? Talk to Oscar. I'm sure you have a lot to talk about. - Is my dad in there? - He's on the path. He's on the trail? Okay. Thank you. Yes. Dad! What are you doing out here? I was just thinking. I hate fighting with you. You think you're ever gonna forgive me? What's my other option? But I want to know everything. When you give a child up for adoption, you've got 30 days to change your mind. A grace period. How long did it take you to decide to come get me? Twenty-nine days. We agreed... That once you were born, we would both leave. She kept her end of the bargain, and I meant to, but I thought I would just... Yeah, go over and visit you for an hour. And then I couldn't stop going. Just staring at you... Talking to you. So... Did you marry mom for my sake? - So that I'd have a mother? - No. I married her because I loved her. Do you? I do. I'm sorry, Gracie. You guys think you're strong enough to get this one? Yeah. - This is heavy. - Yeah, that's because of the shoes. You need lots and lots of shoes when you're visiting so many museums. - No! - No, I'm kidding. - Maximum, three. - Please, don't. - Still, that's too many. - Hey, guys, - the snacks are in the back. - Okay, and just... Put it in the back and then jump in the car. I don't want to hit traffic. - Okay. Bye, dad. - Why don't you take the train? Then you don't have to worry about traffic. - Or crashing. - No, I want to drive. I like to be alone with them because they talk to you in the car. See? I'm listening, even when you think I'm not. - Say hi to your sister. - I will. - Be careful. - Yeah, of course. I'm gonna be careful. Of course. Hey, shorties! Let me give you a hand. Here you go. Hi. So... Do you know about this fund that Theresa asked me to administer? That's what you came for, right? With grace? I'd run it with grace? I don't even think that grace knows. I don't know if it's real. I don't know... - To be honest with you, I don't trust your wife. - You don't trust my wife? She's gonna give you money for your charity and you're gonna question her integrity, huh? Twenty million dollars? Is it real? You don't have to be poor to have good intentions. - There are people with money and principles, okay? - Really? - That's not what I remember you saying when I knew you. - That's because I was an idiotic idealist. But I grew up. Did you? No. Theresa doesn't care about the orphanage. She doesn't want to talk about it. She's interested in business. So, what does she want? Give grace some direction? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Appears to be a running theme for me these days. Well, join the club. I looked at your work online. Yeah? Yeah. It's... Really bad. How do you choose? Can't describe it, really. Can't or don't want to? Both. Fair enough. Certain rocks kind of glow to me. Like an aura? Maybe. So then those are the ones you take? Not at first, no. I leave them there... And then I go back. And if it's still... Lighting up, then I take them. Is that what happened? With grace? She was lighting up? Are you gonna meet us at nobu, or you want to come by the office? For what? For dinner. With Ben and xandy. What are you doing? Is that India? Yeah. I thought we could go. When? For our honeymoon. They're supposed to have great hotels. We're going to Costa Rica. I want to surf. Yeah, I know, I know, but maybe we could do both. India's too far, babe. I can't take that much time off work. We just said we were gonna be gone for a week. Maybe you could go for a week and I could stay for longer. So you want to be alone in India? Because I think you... You hate being alone. I won't be alone. I'll be with Isabel. Yeah. I know. I'm not stupid. Why are you being so shitty? Me? Grace, how do you think it feels to get married to somebody, and then a week later, have them turn into a different person? Did you just think that I was gonna stay the same forever? - Jesus Christ, grace, that's not what I'm saying. - What are you saying? That you can't just change things now, okay? She gave you up. I'm sorry. I got to go, okay? Aardvark? Good one. - Oh, no, it's your turn. - Cheetah. - Yeah, that's good. - Lion. Deer. Camel. Octopus. That... does an octopus count as an animal? - Kind... yeah! - Okay. All right. - It's a sea creature. - Otter. I say otter. Otter? Shark. Dog. Chicken. Crocodile. - Panther. - Okay. All right, guys. Dad! Daddy! Hi, baby. Hey, hey, hey! Daddy, look what we won. - They're huge. - They're huge, right? - Yeah. - How did you win these? There was a lovely go-kart track off the highway, and they had carnival games. Mom said the games were a waste of time, so she bought them. It smelled like feet and hot dogs in there, and I wanted to beat the traffic. Thanks, George Washington. Hey, you guys, go upstairs and take a bath. Okay? And then afterwards, you can play one video game. - Can we pick? - Can we pick? Daddy's gonna pick, okay? Go upstairs and wash those stinky feet. - Okay. - Will you take this upstairs? I have to run into the office. - I will be back for dinner. All right? - Hey, wait... I talked to your doctor. You've known about this for three months? She spoke to you? Yeah. That's a breach of doctor-patient confidentiality. - I could sue her. - She figured I already knew because you promised her you'd tell me after the wedding. I don't have time for this right now. Theresa. Honey, we have to talk about this. - No. No, we... - Yeah, yeah. - I have nothing to talk about. - We have to talk about this. - Let me go. I have to get to work. - Let you go? - Let me go. - I'm your husband! I'm never gonna let you go! Don't tell grace and the boys. - Baby... - Don't tell them. - We'll figure something out. - I have figured it out. There's got to be some kind of experimental treatment or testing... There's not. I've looked. There's nothing. There's nothing that wouldn't just prolong it or make it worse. I don't want you to see me that way and I don't want them to see me that way. So you just want me to do nothing. We don't get to choose. Let me go. Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday, dear jai happy birthday to you we'll do the ice cream how. Tell them I said: Isabel, you're doing something important. Good luck. Bye. So there are a couple of points I don't understand. Okay. Let's see. If you and grace can't agree on how funds are distributed, Oscar gets a tie-breaking vote. - I thought it'd be better if it wasn't me. - Yeah, no. Not that. This. It. Says I have to live in New York? But your cost of living will be taken care of. But I can just come in for board meetings. I can do the rest on Skype. I'm afraid it's a requirement. Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense. Why? Because you're used to running things at the orphanage, but you're not accustomed to managing millions of dollars, so I would like you here. I'll do six months here and six there. It's nonnegotiable. Please don't... don't waste our time pretending that you're not gonna do this. You think I give a shit about your money? Yes, I do. You think I'm for sale? - You wanna buy me? - No, I don't want to buy you, - I want to give you an opportunity. - Bullshit! - That's what it says here. - Call it whatever you want. I don't care. But just think about what you can do with the money and all the kids you could help. - I know you'd sell yourself for that. - You don't know me. Actually, I do. Thirty-nine years old. Born in Troy, New York. Raised in Connecticut by adoptive parents. You went to boarding school upstate. Went to Syracuse for a year, dropped out. Joined the peace corps. Met Oscar. You're a good person. You're well-intentioned. You're an idealist. You're just like grace. I have a life. - Your life will be good here, I promise. - I have a good life there! You think because you're rich, I'm gonna get down on my knees and lick your asshole?! And you think because you're a do-gooder, it makes up for the fact that you abandoned your child, right? Isabel! Isabel, I'm sorry! I'm so, so sorry. - Who do you think you are? You're cruel. - She's your daughter. She needs you. And she needs you here, and Oscar needs you here. - You're crazy! - No. No, I'm sick. I'm... I'm sick. I'm dying. I didn't bring you here just to give you money. What? My boys are 8 years old. Help me. Please. Help me. Do I have to be halfway around the world to get your help? Grace. Can I talk to you? Yeah, of course. Have you told your parents how you feel? No. I can't. They thought I was too young to get married. They were right. God, I wish I wasn't married. Can you tell me what to do? No, grace, I can't. Please. Everyone's gonna hate me if I get divorced, but I don't... I don't know if I can stay married. It's your life. You decide. Like you did? Did you even think about what you were doing to me?! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. I'm here. - Hello. - It's Isabel. Isabel. Did we get the money? Yes. It's a miracle. Let me get jai. We'll celebrate! No, no, no. What's the matter? I'm not... I'm not coming back. I'm staying in New York. What do you mean? For how long? Hey. Is she okay? She's upset. And confused. And she feels like she's made a mistake. What'd you tell her? I told her that it was her life. Thank you for letting her stay with you. Gracie. You're gonna be okay. Hey, sleepyhead. This is really weird. Oh, sure, have some. I'll get some more. Do you want one, dad? Yeah, thanks. Why don't you see if they have some pastries too? She's so sensitive. Oscar, you have to tell her about Theresa. I really... I don't want to... I don't want to hurt her. They're bringing the pastries over. Thank you. Theresa, your turn. Well... it's official. I have a lot less money. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thanks so much. All right. - You're changing a lot of people's lives. - I hope you do everything you want with it. I'm so sorry to interrupt. Grace is here. I wasn't expecting her. Send her in. - I'll just start that 12:30 without you. - That'd be great. Isabel, you can stay. I don't think she's here to see me. Hi, sweetheart. I wish I'd known you were coming. I would have cleared myself for lunch... Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me yourself? - You were lying every minute you knew and didn't tell me. - I'm sorry. - I didn't want to make you sad. - You didn't think I'd be sad if you just died one day? No. “What? I didn't want anything to change. Maybe I was wrong. If I knew that you were dying, I wouldn't have spent my time doing other stuff. It's okay. Okay. It's okay. You'll be okay. No, I don't want to be okay. Okay. Isabel will be here. - She'll be here. - I don't care about Isabel. I care about you. You're my mom, and I... If you don't tell me, I can't... I can't tell you all the things that I want to say. What do you want to say? I can't tell you that I... - That I love you. - I know you do. I love you. I don't want you to die. This pair always gives me trouble. Oh, yeah. I love being needed. It makes me horny. One more second. Thank you. Dance party? - I love to dance. - Mom, this is serious. - Get out of the way! - Get out of the way! It's serious. Oh, sorry. I'll do some serious dancing. So there are not many people who have the power and tenacity to will their vision into existence and in the process, change the way our industry works. Not to mention employing over 1000 people and raising a family - and, oh, yeah, making a shit-ton of money. - Yeah, that's right. So why sell when you have built this big, thriving behemoth of a company? - Why? - That's what I want to know. - Thank you. Right. - No. Why? Why? Why? - Why? Why? Why? - Theresa, why? Okay, so she did say it is because she likes beginnings. And a little bit of hardship. And when things get too easy for her, she gets bored. We bored her. You said it, I didn't. So congratulations, Theresa. You know we love you, and we can't wait to see what you do next. To Theresa. For bringing us all together. - Cheers! - Cheers! Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you - happy birthday, dear Theresa - Dear mom happy birthday to you Thank you. Thank you very much. Just to be clear, my birthday's not until next month, but thank you for being here and thank you for this extraordinary cake. - Did you make this, babe? - Yeah, I did. Your work is generally more abstract than this and it's pretty figurative, - so it's a real departure for you. - First time working with cake. As you know, Oscar is a brilliant artist. I always thought that artists were flaky and impractical, and I never expected to fall in love with one. I thought I was... I was gonna meet a nice banker, but it turns out, there are no nice bankers. Oh, do you know what he said to me in the car on the way here? He said: "Is it us moving through the world, or the world running past us?" To which I said: "Let's not take the northern state. Traffic's terrible at this time." But this is... This is not about... Not about me and my family. This is about us and what we have accomplished together, which is a lot. And I know that many people are wondering what this company is gonna look like now, and I would be lying to you if I didn't say that there would be a period of transition. But if you say to yourself: "I feel uncomfortable," then good. Because discomfort brings growth. I forgot to tell you the... The school called... yeah? To suggest that we split the boys into separate classes after the winter break. They think it might be good for their confidence. I just worry about that... That one teacher, Janet. She's a little melancholy for third grade. Why are you telling me this? You okay? - Let me get you a painkiller, all right? - No. No. I want to know why you're telling me this about the boys. Because we have to decide. No, we don't have to decide anything. You have to decide. It's all done. I did everything I could. But there's always gonna be more to do and you're gonna have to do it. Because I'm not gonna be here. I won't. I won't be here. - You think you'll be with her when I'm gone? - Stop. No, I want to know. Baby, I love you. Where do you go? You know, where will I... 7? Where will I go? I don't know. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't... I don't want to die. I don't want to. I'm not done! - I'm not done! I'm not done! - I know. I know, I know. I'm not done! I know. I know. I know you're not. I know. I'm with you, baby. I'm with you. I'm with you. Isabel. So good to see you. Come. Okay. Come in. Come in. You come with me. So excited to show you all the improvements we've made. Jai! Guess who's here! - Miss Isabel! - Jail oh, I missed you! I missed you too. Miss Isabel? “What? Come. “What? What is it? I ook. A bird's nest. Oh, amazing. - I watched the mother feed them. - Really? What'd she feed them? I entils? No? Vindaloo? No, miss Isabel. Worms. Oh, worms. Jal, I want to ask you something. How would you like to come back with me to New York? To live. No. I will miss my friends. The thing is, is that I have to live there. So then we wouldn't be able to see each other as much. You can come and visit. Yeah, I can. Jal, come! Come on, jal! You want to go play? Go on. Go.
