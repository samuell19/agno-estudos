(relaxed ensemble music) (relaxed ensemble music) (anxious ensemble tones) - Welcome to Windgate State Penitentiary. Well, how does it feel to be behind bars? (media members laughing) If you members of the media follow all the rules, we'll even let you go at the end of the day. As the Director of the Department of Corrections, I've been making some changes here. - You want some? (chattering) - [Prisoner] You guys can't do this to me. Come on. - Now I don't believe in wasting taxpayer's dollars on fancy frills I can tell you but my plan for self- contained housing units is turning Windgate into the most efficient and secure penal institution in the country. (groaning) (grunting) - [Assailant] Get used to it. (classic rock tones) (grunt) - [Prisoner] Jimmy, Jimmy. - [Assailant] Adios, man. - When I am elected State's Attorney General, Windgate will no longer be the exception, it will be the rule. - Take him out. (groan) (thuds) (steady tempo classic rock tones) Fuck you! - Every square inch is under 24 hour surveillance. Machines replace men. One guard does the job of a dozen. (steady tempo classic rock tones) (grunts, thuds) (screaming) These monitors allow us to see what's going on throughout all of our cell blocks. So at all times, we're in complete control. - [Connie] Shouldn't you be checking that out? - See to that. - Yeah. - Quietly. - All right. - Well now, let's go to cell block A. There are some wonderful new recreational facilities I'd like you to see. - Mr. Goddard, that looked very serious. - I'd like your impression of this color scheme. (anxious violin music) (soft classic rock tones) A fitting end to a piece of filth like Luther. But not in an election year. Word gets around there's been a killing in my model cell block, the press will tear me apart. We've got to keep it quiet. What is it I can do for you, Taylor? - I want your job. - All right. All right, you can have Corrections when I am elected Attorney General but in the meantime, you've gotta keep a lid on this place. Now what are we gonna do with him? - Let me explain what happened. - You know, you've had it too soft around here Boland. But no more. I'm gonna send you up to cell block C. You know what that means? You're gonna wish you'd never been born. Do I make myself clear? Ah. A man of few words. Good. - We ain't got to worry about a goddamn thing no more. Sporty Black heard he cut Luther from asshole to elbow. - Now it's my turn to do some cutting. - [Prison Guard] Blue. Out. - Man, what's going on? - Out! - Man, what the hell are you doing? - [Blue] Hey, so what is this? - Bingo. (classic rock tones) Luther's dead, the gravy train is over. I don't get mine, well you don't get yours. - It's only temporary. - No. No, your drug store's out of business for good. The chink just cut off your line of supply. - Don't you know what time it is? - Time for you to get your lazy ass out of bed and clean off this top bunk. - You should learn some manners, Lieutenant. - [Prison Guard] Ready on the lockdown for breakfast call. (distant chattering, laughing) - The bunk's clear. - [Prisoner] That's the vato that killed Luther. (anxious violin, classic rock tones) - Hey. (laughing) Come on fellas, give it back. Fuck you guys. Thanks. - I wasn't hungry anyway. - You know Sam, you've been filing all that paperwork with the Prison Board, gettin' the Warden called in on the carpet. Thought you was real slick, now didn't you? Now he done put that boy right in your house. You better watch you ass, man 'cause he knows Blue's comin' at him. Tell you the truth though, that boy deserves what he gets, slicing up Luther like that. Now don't get me wrong, Luther and me wasn't tight or nothing. - I loathed the man. - But he was a brother. - Not my brother. - What the fuck are you talkin' about, man? You let crackers get away with shit like that, they'll be killing niggas all day long. - I never met a nigga, Clint. I don't know what a nigga looks like. - Well the boy's no cracker anyway. I mean he's Korean or something. What's he doing hanging with the Diddler? You think maybe he's perfecto? (laughs) - You know most of the guys around here, they're real psychopaths. When I see guys like that, I thank God for prisons because there's no way these guys should be allowed on the street. - I just gave you some food. You got any other problems, take it up with the Chaplain. - My name's Wheelhead and I just wanted you to know that me and the brothers, we know about you and what you've done down on A block and even though you're supposed to be some sort of half-breed or something, we appreciate it and you can hang with us. - Take your hand off me. - Man, I am just trying to be neighborly. - [Jimmy] No thanks. - This boy has got some spark here. (prisoners chuckle) (thud) Oh Jesus. (thud) - Oh! - You're a real hard rock. - Yeah he is so get lost, we're eating. - Fuck you, pan-freak! Any mouth out of you and I'll scrape it off your mother fuckin' zipper. I'm gonna tell you something, kid. You see me and the brothers, we're all you have and this place, this place here ain't no place to be alone. So you think about it. (anxious slow rock tones) - Why are you tampering with my personal property? - I was bored. - Next time ask. - What's with all the books? - Knowledge is power. - This is my power. (low chuckle) (mid tempo ensemble music) - [Prisoner] Here he comes, the chink. - You in the wrong part of town, boy. - Sorry, it won't happen again. - Damn right. Hold it. I'm talkin' to you, Chinaman. You took out Luther, he was my partner. He made sure things went pretty sweet for me around here. Bet you didn't know that, did you? - Too bad. (thud, grunt) - Hey, what's going on, what's going on here? - Nothing. - I'm just orienting the brother here to this fine Corrections Facility you allow us to occupy. - Well orient the brother somewhere else. Let's get out of here, Boland. - Boland. Watch your back. Let's go. - [Prison Guard] Recreation time is over, ready for lockdown. (relaxed guitar music) - [Jimmy] Stark. - What? - Can I borrow a book? - Up yours. - Hey, calm down now. - [Samuel] What's the matter, Boland? - [Jimmy] Already read it. - Is that right? - Yeah. - You like it? - Yeah. - Learn anything? - That black people think white people smell like dogs when they get out of the shower. - Let me see what else I can find here. - [Prison Guard] Lights out, lights out, 11 o'clock. - I can't see her picture. - Lights out, boy. - You got any preferences? - Chow hall. - Mostly niggers in there. - So what? - You wouldn't last a day in there, pal. I know where you should go, come on. - [Prisoner] Hey, check it out man. - Well Mr. Boland, welcome to the laundry room. - [Prisoner] Hey boy. - [Prisoner] Wrong neck of the woods. - Hey, check this dude out. Come on down. - Hey homeboy, what's happening man, how you doing? Hey, don't be fuckin' around with my figure again huh? Come on, I want to introduce you around. This right there, that's Chicago man. Doing double life. He came home one day, he found his old lady balling a spic. Killed 'em both. He's funny. This guy over here, now that's Weird Willy man. He don't like faggots and this, this is Stinkbomb man. He ain't shittin', showerin' or shavin' 'til he sees better days. Then you got Leadbottom and that is Buck. - What's my job? - Hey man, relax. Enjoy the scenery, come on. Unlike the rest of this joint, everything in here is white. - Nice and clean. - Just the way we like it. - Except for you man, you know but you did kill that nigger and that counts for something and you know how to throw your hands and shit, so we're gonna let you slide. - Just tell me what my job is. - What's the matter, too good for us scooter trash? - That's okay bro, let him work like a pig. You know laundry's in his blood anyhow, man. (prisoners laugh) There's some clean sheets over there, Mr. Boland. Fold 'em. - [Prisoner] Come on, man. - Hey you all saw it, right? I offered the man our hospitality and he's over there folding sheets. - Yeah. - That's right. - If you don't wanna hang with us, why the hell did you kill Luther? Oh well I get it, must've been one of those lover's quarrel type things. What the fuck are you gonna do, huh? - Get him man, get him. (thuds) (grunts) - Finish him, come on. Finish Boland, fuck him up. Come on, fuck him up, fuck him up. (mid tempo classic rock music) - Oh man. - Woo hoo hoo. - Oh man. - Fucked him up. - I thought he was tough, man. - [Prisoner] I don't like the way he walks. - He's a punk. - That's right. - He's through. (classical violin music) - [Prison Guard] Attention on the compound, visitors hour will be from 10 a.m. to 12. All inmates must have a pass to be admitted. Attention on the compound, attention on the compound. Inmate Bolas report to the infirmary. (creepy chiming music) - Got a visitor? You seen Shrimp? Come on, let's get some exercise, you'll feel better. (hard rock music) (grunting) - Jimmy, watch out! (metal weights clanking) - Come on man. (thuds) Come on, come on. - All right, come on. (classic rock music) - [Prisoner] There we go man, you all messed up. - Yeah. - Do it man, do it. - That's a smart man. - Show him man. - Show him what you got. All together man, all together. Come on, I'm betting on us. (mid tempo electronic, rock music) - Get him, get him. (thuds) (grunts) - [Prisoner] Get him, Charlie. Get him. Come on get up, get up, get up. - All right Jimmy, all right. - [Prisoner] See, you didn't listen to me. - [Prisoner] Come on get up, come on. - [Prisoner Watch your back, Jimmy. (groan) (scream) - [Prisoner] All right, all right. (gasping) Guards, guards coming. - Cuff him. Isolation. - Hey, that was self-defense. - You mind your own business, pervert. (relaxed piano, trumpet music) - [Prison Guard] Pretty nasty cut you got there, son. See you in 30 days. - See that's where you fucked up with the bitch, man. Instead of treating her right and giving her all that shit, you should've had her dancing in the bar and making some money for a mother fucker. - Kinda crowded in there. - I'll catch you later Stinkbomb, here. You got some word? - These petitions take time. - Ah shit, what the fuck's taking them so long? Just beat it, man. - I want to talk about Jimmy. - That's family business. - I want it over, now. - Boland took out three of my best, you know I can't absorb an insult like that. That wouldn't be a proper figurehead type thing to do, man. - You want that appeal or not? - Shit. He wasted one of yours man, you know? I figured I was doing you and the crew a favor. - Let me tell you something Wheelhead, Luther wasn't my anything, the crew is not my crew. Jimmy is in my house. I got one foot out the door, I want no complications. Do you understand me? - Mm hmm. - Yeah. (relaxed electronic, trumpet music) - You are an idiot. - Sir, regulations say the offender must be isolated. - Regulations? Who in the hell do you think you're talking to? I want Boland back with Stark. Every time Bolan scratches his ass, I want him poking Stark in the eye, you got that? - Yes sir. - Good. - [Prisoner] Prison guard coming. - Today's your lucky day, Boland. Get dressed. - [Prisoner] I'm tired of this, I can't take it no more. - Your boys got whooped. All those fat ass Goliaths lying around like a bunch of junk cars and Boland with hardly a scratch. - I know, I know man, don't bug me about it okay? - Watch you want, caveman? - The kid's yours. - I knew that the moment he came on the block. - And I would appreciate it if you'd stomp his mother fuckin' ass for me. - I wouldn't have it any other way. - Why are they sending him here? - That boy is nothing but trouble. - [Samuel] Ain't no telling once we in the middle of it. - [Clint] What are you gonna do? - Hey, hey Jimmy. - Hey, how you doing? Tony DiAngelo, Tony D to my friends. - Jimmy, this is everybody, this is Joe, this is Kelly, Clint Dunsmore, Henry Jones. Grab a chair. Taylor gave you to us, so we're gonna put you straight to work. - Yeah, we be workin' up something in here boy. We gonna start you off to work with a fresh bowl of Italian ziti. - Ain't that nice, huh? What kind of cheese you want? We got Parmesan, ricotta. - Hey, do you like wine boy? - What, that jailhouse bunk? - No no no, we gonna raise here son. - [Henry] It's the real deal. - Ernest and Julio ain't got shit on us. - I gotta tell you boy, I so like the way you scrap. - Yeah, you draw a mean shake. You sure you ain't got Italian blood mixed in you? - It's possible. - Muhammad Ali. - It's possible. - Hey Jimmy, listen. We're gonna have to keep an eye on you. I can't afford any trouble in my house, not now. - [Prison Guard] Attention on the compound, inmate Boland, report to the infirmary. - Are you sick? - No, they just gotta check out that souvenir I got from the welcoming committee. - You watch your ass boy or we'll watch it for you. (laughs) - [Blue] I told you it won't be a problem. - What you mean no problem, all them old guys? - Man you crazy, those old birds won't be working. They'll be dreaming up their piece of the American pie and watching that game show. - Hey man, I like that game show. All them big-tittied hos getting all sporty around them college freshman and whatnot. - But now your boy, come 12 noon, will be working. Mooning over those marigolds and pampering those poppies and he'll be all ours. - Asshole to elbow. - You know it. - Mm hmm. - I appealed on the Williams roll. I figured with statutory gained time and working time, hell, I'll be outta here in 12 days. - [Prison Guard] Lights out, lights out, 11 o'clock. - Jimmy. Tell me about Luther, I'd really like to know. - Oh, Luther. There's nothing much to tell. A friend of mine, a black guy asked me to look out for a cousin of his. Christ, he was just a kid. As soon as he moved into A block, Luther and his gang moved in fast. They raped and killed him. (somber piano, trumpet music) - So how'd you come to be sent here in the first place? - There was this bar I used to go to sometimes after work. One day a fight broke out, a real war. All I wanted to do was get outta there. The next thing I know, a guy's dead and they're pinning the rap on me, manslaughter. 10 years. - Why'd they pick you? - Didn't like the color of my skin. Hey, I'm an American born and bred and just because I'm half-Japanese, the cops are always lookin' at me sideways. (low chuckle) - Lord knows I know a little something about that. (somber piano, trumpet music) Now you say Warden Taylor knowingly withheld information that could've helped you? - [Jimmy] Mm hmm. - Well if that's true, we have a case. - [Steve] Which brings Laura's cash total to $5,000. But that's not all-- - Ooh, baby. - [Steve] What else has Laura won today, Wesley? - [Wesley] Well Steve, she's got a seven day all-paid expenses trip-- - Hey man Tony, get your ass out here, you're gonna miss this. - You want your spaghetti hot, don't you? - Just get your Guinea ass out here, man. - Yes, bwana. Wow, look at that broad, she's a big one, huh? - Hey man, I love big women, man. A nice big juicy onion, a woman I could climb. I don't know what it is about you white boys, man. Y'all all like them women with them little behinds. - Hey Jimmy, how you doing? Pull up a chair. - But that's not all. - No it isn't, Steve. - Unlike some people, I got work to do. - Hey, we got work to do too. (laughs) (cough) - Got any tits on that cart? - Nope. - What, the Chaplain picking out these films or what? - Cut that mother fuckin' chink, that's the way Blue want it. (anxious flute, guitar music) What you want, boy? - I'm looking for Stark. - He ain't here. Get outta here, now. - You and Mike went. - Pass the ball. - Man, can't you find some goddamn chicken? I'm tired of this shit. Mother fucker, how much are sausages? - [Tony] What do you think I'm doing here? - I'm tired of this shit. - Trying to cook for you. Fuck you, shit. - [Clint] I'll stick a pineapple up your ass. - [Tony] You know what, you're gonna fuckin' eat it. It's going in your mouth, it's not going in mine. (anxious ensemble tones) - Hey. What's the matter, you're making too much damn noise. - Jimmy. - Gonna kick your diamond ass. (anxious rock tones) - Just got off the boat, think you own the fuckin' world. Racist mother fucker. - Come on, mother fucker. - You scared, boy? (mid tempo classic rock music) (thuds) (groan) - Hey Stark. Jimmy. - Yeah, yeah. Come on. (thud) - [Prisoner] Come on get up, what are you doing? - You fucking rat bastard. These guys were beating the shit out of this guy. I want you to know I had nothin' to do with it, nothing. (thuds) - Come on Jimmy, get the fuckin' door. - Open this goddamn fuckin' door. Come on Jimmy, open this damn door, I ain't bullshitting. Assholes. - All of you for one man? They're showing you a lot of respect Jimmy, coming at you this deep. What, somebody got a problem with this man, huh Sporty? How about you, French Fry? You got a problem with this man, Stewart? No, no, no, no, no. There's only one man in here who's got a problem, one man. - what you doing house nigga, working for the Warden? - Luther supplied you with drugs, Blue. The crew paid you for what you got free. - For free? - That's right. - [Prisoner] What's up Blue, what he talkin' about? - So why don't you show the crew just how it's done? - No problem. - No problem? Let the brother supreme show us all how it's done. - [Prisoner] Do it, Blue. - Sound good for you? - Let's get busy. (anxious ensemble music) (thuds) (grunts) - Get up, get up man. Kick his ass man, I'm tired of this guy. Kick his ass man. (scream) Come on, Blue. (thuds, grunts) - [Clint] Yo, those guards passing. - That's enough. (thud, grunt) I said that's enough. Yeah go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Come on. Come on, Jimmy. These men here seem to think you hate them, Jimmy. They think you hate all blacks, is this true? - I've got no problem with anyone. - They've also been led to believe that you killed their dear friend Luther maliciously and without a cause. Is this true? - It was malicious. But I had cause. - It seems that your dear brother Luther attacked a friend of Jimmy's. Luther hit on a black man, a brother, a child! Raped him and killed him. Jimmy did what he had to do, it wasn't right, it wasn't smart, it was human and he'll have to live with that. You see, we were all born into a bad situation and we graduated to something even worse. They don't care whether we live or die in here. So if you wanna fight, fight the damn system that got you here. Not each other. (relaxed violin, flute music) You all right? Shit. Get the hell outta my garden, get the hell out, let's go! - Hey Diddler. Thanks. (relaxed guitar tones) - Well Jimmy, I wish I could say it's over but it's not. Blue's anger is endless. Next time he comes at you, he won't be in a crowd. It'll be outta nowhere and fast. You better be ready. - What's he so angry about? - He's serving a double life term. - I didn't mean to get you involved. - You didn't have anything to do with it. We share a house, Jimmy. It was unavoidable, Taylor saw to that. - [Lucas] Any time, boy. - You see a boy, Lucas, you'd get down and suck his bald dick. - You could've used some more of that tough guy shit yesterday. - Hey man, they jumped me. - Who? - Boland, Stark. I don't want no trouble, I just want to do my time like everybody else. But those two, they're just begging for it. - Well what's next, the trouble over? - Just starting. Crew's so pissed off, they ready to slap off and ride. You'll be dropping Boland and Stark in body bags in no time. - You've been very helpful, Blue. This is your lucky day. You do whatever it takes. Go on. - [Lucas] What do you think? - Well I think that somebody's gonna get hurt real bad real soon. - So how do we handle it, isolation? - No. I kind of like to see Stark in the thick of things. No confinement for anyone. - Fellas into the yard, we got some serious conspiring to do. - I ain't doing nothing. - All you trying to do is catch a brother up. A brother will lose his teeth listening to you. - [Blue] You ought to show the brother some respect. - Fuck that, that old man is okay. - And I ain't got no problem with the chink. - He took out Luther. - So the fuck what? The way you carrying on, you'd think y'all two was swapping spit or something. - Nobody talks to me that way. - Man what you gonna do, kill all us brothers? - Get your ziti cooking, Guinea ass outta that damn chair. You ain't done nothin' all day. - Are you crazy? You think it's easy organizing this shit? (anxious violin tones) - What do you want? - Listen man, it ain't like that. We just a bunch of jitterbugs trying to do the right thing. - What the brother trying to say is we feel bad, we'd like to help you fix your place up. You old enough to be our father. We shouldn't be doing this to no old pops dude and Boland, we ain't got no problem with you, man. - Nah, man. - We could use the help. - Old man hit a fuckin' homer off my head. Now that's a terrible morale-type thing, man. - I know what you mean, crew spent half the week planting petunias. - Fuck it, I ain't puttin' up with this shit no more. You know I got leadership qualities and I'm looking like a fuckin' towelhead. - Well, we're gonna end it right now. - Who, you and me? - That's what I said. I got a thing with the Warden, might come in handy one day. We gotta share the power, baby. - When you wanna do it, man? - Soon. We've gotta start at the bottom, the pervert first. We gotta have a system, right? - Right, man. - Hey man. (inmates shouting) Oh yeah, pervert. (clapping) - Hey, you wanna see this film or not? (laughing) - [Prisoner] No, no man. - [Prisoner] Hey Diddler, hey man, get it goin' partner. (speaking foreign language) (up tempo flute, guitar music) - Yeah. - Come on, TNT. Shut up. - Perhaps this will not be necessary. - I've never made it with a chink before. - Yeah. - Yeah. (inmates cheering) - [Actress] Okay baby. (speaking foreign language) (anxious ensemble music) (stifled screaming) (thuds, grunts) - Hey. - Hey! - Come on, man. - What you doing, man? (inmates shouting) Let's go. Get your ass out here. Punk ass. (somber violin music) - All right ladies, entertainment is over. Back to the cell house! Move! (anxious rock tones) - Back off, Jimmy. We're going home, we're going home. Come on. So what are you gonna do, Jimmy? You gonna kill 'em both? You wanna risk a life term because of these men, huh? 20 years, 20 years of total lockdown. I'll tell you something else, the first five gonna be in a hellhole half the size of this. Is that what you want, what's the matter with you? Have you lost your taste for freedom? - He saved my life. - Yeah. You had to bring me up here? - [Taylor] Yeah, because up here you can smell freedom. This is as close as you're gonna get to it. - Why you trying to jam my time, Taylor? You wait 'til I'm almost ready to go home and then you drop this situation on me. - Situation? - That's right, you know what I'm talking about. - Yes. Well, I understand that you and Mr. Boland are almost like brothers now. - Let me tell you something, Taylor. I don't belong in C block and nor does the kid. He's only gonna wind up killed and why aren't Blue and Wheelhead in isolation? And your damn guards, all they do is drink coffee all day long. They only come around after the trouble is over. - Oh, well thank God we have a man to tell us how to do our job now. I mean without you, I just don't know how we could possibly carry on. You're dismissed, counselor. - Stark really gets your goat, doesn't he? - He's been breaking my balls for years. Filing writs, drowning me in paper. Making me treat these animals like human beings. Well now it's my turn. - What are you fixing to do? - One of these days soon, somebody's gonna get sliced up and when that happens, I'm gonna be there to pin it on Stark. - You know every day when I used to come home from school, my mom would fry me up some grilled Swiss and tomato sandwiches, every day. Never nothing else. I couldn't fuckin' stand 'em and now since I've been inside, I think about those damn grilled Swisses and my mom too, you know. She worked really hard at making those. - It's a real nice sentimental story, give me the grill. - Oh man. I wish we had some tomatoes. - Now if you want that greenhouse shit, you better go kiss Stark's wrinkled ass. - Fuck that old man. - You wanna fuck me, Wheelhead? - Talking's over, old man. - Yeah. Look what you did to my head. - You never looked better. - I'm through with you, man. You and me both know I ain't never gonna get no writ of Habeas what the fuck ever, man. I am here for 20 years. So you suck my dick. - Look, there's a lot of men in here that don't want to see Jimmy get hurt, they respect him. They like to see a man who can handle himself, who sticks up for his friends. So maybe it's time the two of you just kinda let it go. - This is the last stop for me, Stark. The man waxed my life. He doesn't like me as much as he likes you, uncle. If I don't get me any respect right now, mother fuckers will be playing me close for the rest of my life. So I'm gonna get me some straightening and then I'll rest. If I have to go through you to do it, so be it. - You know Blue, I feel sorry for you. So involved with your own hate. You'd rather die than let it go. - Man, I am tired of your sorry ass, Mahatma Gandhi peaceful resistance bullshit. - You punks have been killing me with your eyes and your mouths for damn near 15 years. But I'm still standing. - That's it. We do it tomorrow. - Tomorrow's a holiday, man. - I know, my Independence Day. (relaxed country guitar music) - [Prison Guard] Attention on the compound, Bill Goddard, Head of our Department of Corrections will be bringing a delegation here for President's Day. He wants you to show our guests how much you appreciate the celebration by being on your best behavior. Let's make this a holiday - Hello. - [Prison Guard] To remember. - There's a lot of people out there in their own little prisons. So what's the count? A few more days and you're outta here. - Yeah. Three more days and I wake up. - You know Jimmy, I've been doing some thinking about your case. I might be able to help you when I get on the outside. You know when I'm gone, these inmates are gonna need a counselor. I mean, somebody's gonna have to pick up the mantle. What do you say? - I don't think so. - [Prison Guard] Attention on the compound, all inmates report to your assigned areas for President's Day. Let's make this a holiday to remember. (chattering) - [Prisoner] But baby, I'm only here for five more years. - And for the last eight years as Director of the Department of Corrections, I've turned hardened criminals into productive members of society. That's why I decided to run for State's Attorney General. Well now, ladies and gentlemen of the press, feel free to look around and I think you'll find that my methods are working. - Goddamn, a whole half chicken. Napkins, red, white and blue silverware and look at that, corn on the mother fuckin' cob. There must be something special going on. Sweet potato pie, yeah. - Yeah, I saw the Pope out in the yard slicing up a jungle plum. - Goddard's still running his mouth. - Attention on the compound, attention on the compound, all inmates wishing to participate in intramural sports, see the Recreation Officer by tomorrow. - You know we've learned from experience that when an inmate's belly is full, he's less prone to violent and erratic behavior. I know I am. So we feed them well. Well but not too well. Try the potatoes. - They should've filmed this yesterday, huh? - Oh yeah, mystery meat. - Damn Stark, pretty soon you'll be able to eat like this every damn day. - What are you talking about? He's been eating good. When you get out there, there's nobody makes sauce like mine. - Is that right, Tony A? - What's the first thing you're gonna do Stark, when you hit the street? - I know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna break loose the fuckin' jam because my pussy's all tore up. (laughs) - No, I think I'm gonna go to the beach. - Hey man, they got some find sandy trim down at the beach. - No, no, no. I think I'm gonna go at dusk. You know that time of the day when there are very few people on the beach and the only sounds you can hear are the seagulls and the waves splashing up on the sand? The sky takes on those beautiful colors of orange and red and purple and your toes are all warmed by the sand. Yeah, that's when I'll take my swim. - And then you'll get some pussy. (laughs) - Attention on the compound, attention on the compound, inmate Stark, report to Horticulture. - Hey, it's our seeds. Hey, we're gonna have grown tomatoes fellas. - Not a moment's peace. - Relax, I'll go. (anxious low violin tones) (slow tempo rock tones) - Attention on the compound, attention on the compound, inmate Boland report to the infirmary. - Hey, the nurse is calling Jimmy. - Bandages coming off I guess. I'm gonna go up and tell 'em he's on his way. When he comes back, tell him to come on up. (anxious ensemble tones) - Where's Stark? - He just left. He went to the infirmary for you. Your bandages coming off? - They came off yesterday. - Hey, where you going? Let's go get him. - Shit, it's the old man. - I really don't care who's first. (anxious rock tones) (grunting) Let's go. (somber piano, rock tones) - [Jimmy] Get help. - Go get help. - Okay. They got Stark. - Wait, what happened? - They stabbed him. - We gotta do something. Let's go, come on. - It's just a skirmish. Everything is under control. Our guests are not to leave this room. Be right back. - One side. Move it. Show's over, gotta get help in here. - Boland, let him go. - You did this. - Cut off all the phone lines to the outside. - I know what happened. I know and so do they. - Come on, Jimmy. Let the doctors do their job. - Lieutenant, I told you to clear this area. - Goddammit move, now! - You can't do nothin' now, Jimmy. - Yeah, stay calm. - Take care of him. - [Prison Guard] All inmates report to your assigned areas immediately. - Get off me, man. - You better back out my face. - Kick some ass. (inmates shouting) - What's going on? - I'll tell you what's going on. Somebody got himself fucked up, that's what's going on. - Fucked up, what do you mean fucked up? - Fucked up, fucked up, ain't nothin' new. Every day around here it's something else. - Let's go. - [Prisoner] Move. - [Prisoner] Hey man, somebody got Stark. They took him out man, come on. Come on man, come on. They got him down there, come on with me. - Listen Roger, we gotta help him out. - Hey you guys, there's a news van over there. We gotta get their attention, come on. (shouting) - You can't do nothin' about that, boy. - I don't care. - He's right about that. - I've got business. - Want me to fire your ass, Jimmy? (alarm blaring) (inmates shouting) - Get out there. Don't let this thing spread. Contain. Contain. (up tempo rock music) - What is this, what's happening? It was one old man, what's going on? - Anything could set it off, sometimes it stops just as fast. - The media is here for Christ's sake. (knock) - It's the press, they're heading for cell block C. - Well stop them. Now listen to me, you get control of this right now or you'll be busted back to guard duty. (alarm blaring) (inmates shouting) - Shit man, everybody in the whole fuckin' joint knows we did it. - Man, why don't you just shut up? We did nothing, they don't know anything. All they're gonna do is lock us down. Now we just shut up and play dumb and I know you can do that. We're gonna be all right, get the fuck in the cell. - [Prison Guard] All inmates report back to your assigned areas. We will be forced to use extreme prejudice. This is your final warning. - [Blue] Man, you're starting to sound like a little bitch. - We're fucked, man. - That's right. - [Wheelhead] Fucking gasoline, man. (grunts, thuds) - [Lieutenant] This is not a game inmates, hit the fucking floor now or we will open it up. - This is for Luther. - No. It's for Stark. (mid tempo rock music) - Son of a bitch. Get up! Get up. (choking, gurgling) (thuds, grunts) (mid tempo drumbeat) (anxious violin tones) No more. Please. - [Prison Guard] Drop it, Boland. - [Jimmy] Go ahead, shoot. Where do you think I'll fall? Here? - We didn't do nothing, Boland. Now come on, don't. - Go on Chinaman, you won't ever get out. Do it. - I don't wanna get out. - We didn't kill that old nigger, we didn't do it honestly. - Nigger? - It's words man, come on, it's just words man. - You got any more, you better say 'em fast. - [Clint] Boland, look out. - Boland. Come on, walk away. - You ready to go? - Do it. - All right man, all right we get it man, we did it. - Shut up! - What'd you do? - Diddler and Stark man, we did it. We killed 'em both, now come on please man. - Yeah mother fucker, we did it. We got the rat and the old man. What you gonna do? - You heard that. - Fuck you Boland, fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you, Boland. - Now do your job. - Get everybody locked down. Get the injured men to the infirmary, clear this area. - Mr. Goddard, would you care to make a statement? - Yes of course, well as you can see, we once again restored order to this institution. - Don't you think it's a little late for that? - What do you mean, Connie? - You can watch it on the six o'clock news. (somber piano, trumpet music) - [Prison Guard] Ready on the lock-in. (cell door buzzing) 11 o'clock, lights out, lights out. (relaxed piano, guitar music) - I won't lie to you, Stark. It's a hell of a good thing to have you gone. - It's a hell of a good thing to be going. - You planning on causing us any more trouble? - Plenty. Well son, I can't say I'm gonna miss this place but I will miss you. Gonna be doing some legal work for you on the outside, get you outta here. You know I wish you'd reconsider about taking over for me. The guys on the inside are gonna need someone. (relaxed ensemble music) On the outside. - Outside. - [Prison Guard] Let's go, counselor.
