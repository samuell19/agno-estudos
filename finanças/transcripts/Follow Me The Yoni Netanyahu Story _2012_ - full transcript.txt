And when we came to Israel he was a small child. Uh, just a baby. Three years old. We were three kids here. Three boys. And we were very, very close. We were... We were really a band of brothers. The relationships between the brothers were very special. His mother used to say that they're a mutual admiration society. All three of them. They really loved and admired each other. My mother was a very down-to-earth, practical woman. My father had great visions. She always said "I'm married to a genius, but somebody has to change his socks." My father was working. My mother was the person who took care of us, who educated us, who nurtured us. And she would make sure we had the family meals together, the Sabbath meals, all these things. My father, who was a great scholar and the editor in chief of the Encyclopedia Hebrea, used to entertain, you know, very great scholars, all sorts of professors. He and my mother would entertain them in the frontal part of the house. There was a door that was the back part of the house. That's where we three kids brought in the entire kids from the neighbourhood. And we used to have enormous pillow fights here. My mother would occasionally open the door and say, "Children, there are people in front." And we'd say, "Oh, that's all right." Then she'd go back and then we'd start it all over again. Yoni was considered the protector. If there was a problem of protection, he would jump into the danger point. He was a remarkable child. He was a person who didn't mind taking risks. He was Iddo's protector. I was sandwiched in the middle. You know, I could receive but not deliver, so to speak. He always said that he never beat me. He said, "I'm disciplining you so that you treat Iddo well and also so you learn to absorb pain." So I said, "Thanks a lot. I got the point." * Jerusalem in those days was not like today. It was a small town. Divided city. And Yoni and his family used to live in Talpiot, which was the neighbourhood-- The isolated neighbourhood near the border with Jordan. There weren't that many houses there. There were a lot of open fields. The neighbourhood kids, at that time, used to play outside in the street. Our life was outdoors. We had battles all over the town, and the place we had-- Maccabees and Greeks. We went to a little wooded area here, and they had bows and arrows. And there was a sense of great freedom. The vibrancy of youth. "The best and most beautiful days I ever had "were those when I was a little child, "hiding in huge fields, "covered almost completely by grass "looking for ladybugs, "seeing the world as the most marvellous place and grown-ups as veritable giants." My father decided to leave the encyclopedia to do his research work in the USA, Philadelphia. For a few years, that was his plan. Until he'll finish his book on the Inquisition. When we heard that we were going to leave for the US, I think I was in the eighth grade and Iddo was a child. Yoni was in the middle of high school. I think we all broke up crying. I don't remember us crying that often, but it was a terrible crisis for us. Yoni wanted to stay. He was already 16 1/2 years old. At that age it's very difficult to leave. He had a very active social life. He was the head of the student council. He was enamoured with the Scout troops. At the time, in Jerusalem, the Scouts were extremely important for the youngsters. It was a way of preparing yourself for the future in the army. He was in the Moudahin tribe and I was in the Metzada tribe. But he was very powerful, and he actually recruited people from our tribe as well. He was good. His personality attracted the youngsters to come and follow and join the Scouts. Yoni was very charismatic. And I think that he liked leading, but he also felt that it's his responsibility. Charisma is the quality and leadership is the commitment. The Boy Scout and the life in Israel made him a real patriot, you know? He was a real Zionist, and in high school, for him to live out of Israel was a big disappointment. "All this space that surrounds me "leaves me without any air to breathe. "I yearn for a place that's narrow, hot, "rotten, filthy. "A place that's mostly desert, and that one can scarcely find on a map of the world." "The only things people talk about are cars and girls. "I think Freud would have found very fertile soil here. "My school has about 1500 students "who don't know what they're doing there. "It looks more like the Tel Aviv Sheraton "than a school. "My house is terribly nice. "Surrounded by lawns and trees. An empty, meaningless life." An Air France jet was hijacked by Palestinian guerrillas today. Onboard, some 80 Israelis and 157 other passengers. This one involves an Air France Tel Aviv to Paris flight taken over by seven members of a Palestinian guerrilla group shortly after an Athens stopover. The twin engine plane landed at Benghazi, Libya, and after refuelling, took off for an unknown destination. The Israeli government's position has always been to refuse to accept terrorist blackmail. And it all boils down to a simple but frightening question: Who gives in first? * We were in the middle of fighting terror. And taking aircrafts and taking hostages were part of the fighting We didn't know where are they aiming at. We thought they may try to land in Tel Aviv. In the Ben Gurion Airport. But then they changed their course to Entebbe. What the hell is this Entebbe? It ended up to be a quarter of the perimeter of the part of the globe that we have seen. When I came first time to the chief, saying to him, "Look, we have to plan what to do with those hostages." And so he say, "Yeah, you are crazy. Who can reach them in Uganda in Entebbe?" Israel is determined with the murderous organizations. We'll never negotiate. The only place where we can meet with them is on the battlefield. July 8th, 1964. "Dear Mother and Father, "when I saw the country from the plane, "I felt a twinge in my heart. "Jerusalem is more beautiful than ever. "Perhaps I am a bit sentimental, "because I haven't seen it for so long. "Despite everything that's wrong here, "and God knows there are many faults and evils, "it's our country and I love her as I always have." After high school, many of our friends went to the army. And Yoni came, and he was like a star. He was very charismatic. He was very intelligent, very passionate. It was a feeling of somebody who was much above everybody with his philosophy of life or his care of the country. We had mutual friends. You know, friends who admired him, and girls who were in love with him. I was impressed with the fact that he had no family here. I came home and told my mother that I met a boy and so on, and I don't know who cooks for him and who washes for him. I thought of inviting him over, and I took pity on him. He went from one boyfriend to another with his-- He was like a gypsy, you know? Homeless. Yoni was in a cafe near their school and I went there. And I was impressed. He sat there all by himself smoking a cigarette, drinking coffee, reading the evening paper. You know, it was like a little bit grown up. Man of the world. He had a great smile. He was a handsome kid. He was extremely strong. Dynamic. Interesting. Fun to be around. I presume, correct me if I'm wrong, that's what girls like in boys. He came to be enlisted, and he has always had a list of things to do. Catch up with physics and math and this and that. And one of them was to find a girlfriend. And there was also a timetable. He was going to go to the army. So he went for it. And I had to go out of it. And I was impressed. We started on July 12th. And I think he enlisted a month later. And I went beginning of September. "Dear Father, Mother and brothers, "basic training started a few days ago. "From Wednesday to Saturday we'll have a march "to get to know your personal equipment, "which means marching 25 miles a day. "But that doesn't worry me. "I've reached the conclusion that anything the army requires of a soldier, I can do." He told us about his accomplishments, how he did as a solider. And he always came first in any course he took. At that time we didn't make long, overseas phone calls. Nobody did. And the connection was with letters. He wrote because it was an expression of his inner being, of his soul. And I remember we used to wait for the letter. It used to have that flag. I remember the little red flag that they have on these American mailboxes. I used to rush to the mailbox to see if there was a letter. And his letters were always illuminating. "Until now, I must admit "I never felt the country. "Never before had I felt this so powerfully. "I knew the country existed, "but I was living in it, "and that if the meter rose, I would fight for it. "But really, to feel the place, "the soil, the mountains and valleys of Israel... "this sensation I have now experienced for the first time." He was an unbelievably good soldier. Someone marked for glory. A few weeks into basic training, they took us on a forced march through the dunes carrying the heaviest guy on each squad on a stretcher. And after a few kilometres, we gave out. And there was just no one there to replace the two guys at the front of the stretcher. And suddenly Yoni breaks up there, takes the stretcher on both his shoulders and pulls everybody else to the end. And then turns around and gives us all a berating for being such weaklings. He was driving his own buddies even harder than the staff were. So he was very much admired... but for a long time he wasn't very popular. I wrote him a lot; he answered a little bit. And I wasn't that interested in stories about the army. More about the "I love you" part and so on. Once he was in the army, he was 100% there and did everything 100%. And it was difficult for him to finagle, you know, two worlds. To come home and be a boyfriend. "Tutti, my love, "the days pass so swiftly here "that one loses all sense of time. "I miss you more than I have ever thought possible. "I realize you have been inducted into the army. "Clearly there are better ways of spending one's years "between 18 and 20. "I wish I could say I will be beside you "all along the path you must take, "but it can't be. "Each of us must walk this path all alone. "I'm writing this just so you'll know "that I'm thinking of you and I love you. As I write this, it sounds so very far away." That Air France jet hijacked by pro-Palestinian extremists is at an airport outside Kampala, Uganda, tonight. The hijackers let more than 250 people off the plane, but the passengers are now sitting in a sweltering airport under the guns of some very dangerous Palestinian extremists. We got an ultimatum that, on Thursday, they are going to be assassinated. All of them. Their price for releasing them is the release of 57 of what they call freedom fighters, now in prison in five countries. I thought there was no chance that we can relieve the hijacked persons by relieving the different terrorists they have asked for. From Israel, from Germany, from France. Now, considering the time, the ultimatum was short. Several days I thought this is no option. And Mota, the chief of staff, is in the cabinet meeting. And told the government that we will prepare something. There was a huge cloud of foam over the picture, because it was not clear what's there, who is there, what kind of situation is it? And it took some time to learn-- Information accumulated very, very, very slowly. The options that were put on the table of the cabinet were unworkable. I said, "I'm not interested in it." The purpose of the operation must be to bring back all the people. March 23rd, 1967. "Beloved ones, "as the time of discharge approaches, "everyone is confronted with the problem "of what to do as a civilian. "War is hanging over our heads like a swollen balloon. "And the battalion is very anxious "for me to stay on in the army. "Even though I find the army to be of great interest, "I fail to see my future in it. "There are so many things I want to do, "and it's difficult to see myself "as an army man all my life. "I received your letter in which you described "in detail the scholarship awarded to me from Harvard. "I'd like you to inform the university "that I am interested. There was always a split in him between the army and the academy. He never signed for 10 years. It was always for two, three years, because the struggle or the tension between these two poles of his personality were always there. I'm not sure that Yoni was a natural soldier. He was very good one, very effective, but out of some kind of-- Of a conscious process of trying to understand what should be done. Nasser is not content with mere border incidences. This time he announces his resolve to destroy Israel. And in mid-May 1967, the might of the Egyptian forces, equipped by the Soviet Union, parades through Cairo en route to Sinai where it will deploy for the attack on Israel. This is the largest force ever to have been assembled in history in Sinai. "Dear Father and Mother, "not one of us wants war, "but we all know for certain we must win. "We must cling to our country with our bodies "and with all of our strength. "Only then will they not write in the history books "that once, indeed, the Jews held on to their land "for two decades, "but then were overwhelmed and became once more homeless wanderers." "Tutti, my love... "don't be afraid and don't worry too much. "We knew a long time ago war would come, "and here we are: a nation at war. "Tutti, according to the plans you and I made, "we were meant to meet two hours ago "and perhaps go to the seaside. "And now I'm far from there. "If there was no war going on here, "if I didn't have to go out and kill, "and if I wasn't alone without you, "it would actually be nice here. "A thistle is the flower nearest me. "I'm sending it to you. But it will probably crumple away before it reaches you." Most of our battalion was involved in the heliborne raid on the Egyptian artillery at Umm Katef. This was the major Egyptian sort of stronghold in the Sinai Desert that had to be crushed in order for the Israeli army to advance forward. The Egyptians discovered the landing ground and began bombarding it. And we were the last to go in. So we didn't go in. Yoni was so frustrated that he actually absconded from the company and jumped on one of the helicopters. He saw that they were going to battle, and he just went into one of his helicopters and took part as a regular soldier, even though he was an officer. Israel appears to be mounting a quick succession of victories here in the Sinai Peninsula. Israel is full of rumours tonight, and you can tell something about a nation's morale by its rumours. And Israel's are all of victory. "My beloved, "that's it. "Our battle has ended. "I'm well and all in one piece. "We left the expanses of sand "strewn with the bodies of the dead, "filled with fire and smoke. "And now we are once again in our own country. "I'm eaten up with worry for you. "Perhaps in a few days when it's all over "and we're together again, "then we'll smile. "Right now it's a bit hard. "Tonight we'll be shooting again, "and again there'll be dead and wounded. "Try to find Bibi and tell him everything's okay." We went north, and finally the whole outfit got into the fighting in the Golan Heights. He was going over to help a friend of his. Sort of leaning down to help him. And that's when he got hit. He was bleeding all the time, and the one thing he wanted to was survive. When you see death face-to-face, and you're wounded and alone in the midst of a scorched field, surrounded by smoke with your arms shattered and burning with a terrible pain, then life becomes more precious and craved for than ever. You want to embrace it and to go on with it. To escape from all the blood and death. To live. When he was wounded, he thought he was going to die. He realized that, to get married, that's what's important for him. "Beloved Mother and Father, "I'm very happy to tell you that Tutti and I "are to be married as soon as I am better. "I considered going to America for a year without Tutti "and getting married later. "Now I don't see any sense in this. "Nor do I believe that I could stay in America "for a year and study there with my heart and my thoughts elsewhere." And we got married in August. That's when he could remove his cast. * It was a glorious wedding. It was in the amphitheatre overlooking the Judaean Hills falling to the Dead Sea. It was extraordinary. It was even extraordinary setting. It represented, I think, him in many ways. He was 21. When I think of it now, he was so young. April 15, 1968. "Dear Bibi and Iddo. "Harvard continues to be marvellous, "even though I'm impatient to return. "I continue to run even though I don't have time. "But at least I'm keeping fit and not letting myself go. "My average for the year is nearly an A, "and in the top 10% of the class. "Tutti and I feel good together, "and it's a good thing "we're spending out first year by ourselves, away from everyone." I liked Boston. And it seemed like two children playing house, you know? That's what it was. It was the first time in my life that I cooked. And Yoni would admire: "Whoa, what did you make?" He always admired everything I did. I remember he asked once, he wanted coleslaw. I had no idea what coleslaw was. I still don't know what the words mean. What's "cole" and what's "slaw"? I was attached to my parents, and there I was only with Yoni. So it's strange. It's sort of lonely. I worked at the consulate. And it was difficult, because every day I would know what happened in Israel, because the consulate would get the paper and would get telegrams and so on. And you're not there. There was a lot of internal terrorism at the time. And so he felt that it's just a matter of time until there would be another major war. For nearly six hours today, Israeli and Egyptian artillery again duelled across the Suez Canal. UN observers issued three appeals for a ceasefire before the shooting finally stopped. He knew he was a very good soldier. He knew that he was, in many ways, better than most of his peers. He cannot continue with the student life when war was raging all over. What's the sense of being a scholar if the whole country disappears? He was aware of the role that our generation is playing on the stage of history, and deeply connected with serving something which is bigger, more important, more powerful than you, and the fate of the people you are part of. Forty-seven hostages aboard that Air France jet hijacked last Sunday were freed today by their pro-Palestinian captors in Uganda. But they stood nervously holding machine guns on the remaining 209, and threatened to kill them all and to blow up the French airliner unless their demands are met by 8:00 tomorrow morning, Eastern time. The French interrogated those people who were selected to be freed, and came to Paris. Several options became invalid when it became clear that the Ugandans are part of it. There was some selection they made between the Gentiles and the Jews and Israelis. Many of those released paid tributes to the Israelis still in guerrilla hands. They said the Israelis were showing high morale and high spirits and much pride in the face of threats to kill them. For me, the separation between Jews and non-Jews was a crucial point. And here, I saw a combination of their terror and all the hatred and brutality of those nasty people. The mood was that this is our mission, this is our destiny, and we must do it. And the only ones that can do it is us. Not anyone else. So the first few days were, for me, extremely difficult. So everybody was cynical about the operation. So I was really left with the group of young officers whom I trusted. But they weren't considered elders of the tribe. And this group was something unique. They were worried about the nation. They weren't worried about themselves. And they had the record. Extremely courageous. They studied the map like their parents studied the Talmud. A word after a word, a line after a line. They weren't fantasizing. They really studied it. And they came to me and they says, "Let's try." August 17th, 1968. "Dear Mother and Father, "today is our first wedding anniversary. "Tutti's and mine. "So much has happened since that day on Mount Scopus. "After the end of the war I got married, "studied at Harvard and came back to Israel. "And yet it wasn't the war that was a passing stage, "but everything that came in its wake. "A kind of sadness has overtaken me, "which doesn't leave me. "I sense the cry and the depth of this sadness in others "who came through the war with their bodies intact. "That harmony that characterizes "a young man's world is not a part of me anymore. "We're young. "And we were not born for wars alone. "I intend to go on with my studies, "but I can no longer see this as my main mission in life. "Hence, the sadness of young men destined for endless war." I assumed, at the time, that he could never be in the army because he was disabled. With one arm that he can't straighten or bend. There was need for officers. I was against it, but Yoni... he wasn't the type to be told what to do, and I wasn't the type to tell somebody else what to do with their lives. And they had to get through the physical in the military reinduction. So they found, apparently, the doctor was an immigrant. And he apparently mistook the fact that Yoni had a fractured elbow. And he looked in one knee-- He thought it was a knee. He said, "Hmm, this knee is fine." And he looked at the other knee and said, "Hmm, this knee is fine." He said, "Fine, nothing wrong with him." That's how he got into the unit. We never used the formal real name of the unit, which was Sayeret Matkal. Ever. The reputation was mystery. We always liked to say that it was the diamond which is at the tip of the spear. That secret club, so-called, that you wanted to be a member of, even though you didn't really know, have any idea, what it was about and what it entailed to be part of that club. For me, the unit was something which was like another world. Like in the movies. They did different stuff. They behaved in different ways. The work itself, which is very intensive, very complicated and very important and very risky. And I think it's like the tip of an iceberg, what's known to the public. Either participating in war times within the war, or fighting against terror. And the rest is unknown and, I believe when we left, unknown. We live in different worlds. So it's difficult. I'm a curious person. I would ask questions, but I didn't get answers. But there was also a part of me that didn't want to know, and a part of denial in order not to be afraid. "Beloved, "the day after tomorrow you will be 23. "Happy birthday. "I'm writing this to pre-empt the thought "that may come to your mind. "So why the separation? "I believe with all my heart "that it's extremely important that I be in the army now. "We hear the war slogans of millions of our neighbours "and their desire to annihilate us, "including you, my wife. "I realize that it's very hard for you. What's to be done?" He wanted very much to have children as soon as possible. He loved babies, and they loved him. When I realized I was pregnant I stayed a whole month or so in hospital just trying, you know, to prevent a miscarriage. He wasn't there days on end, you know? He didn't take special leave. He came when he came. "Beloved Mother and Father, "I haven't written you for a long time, "because Tutti had problems with her pregnancy. "To my great sorrow, "Tutti miscarried a few days ago, "in the sixth month. "The baby girl was born and lived a few days. "Of course, she didn't stand a chance right from the start, "and we both knew it. "But just the same, it's very sad." I heard from Tutti when we spoke that there was a big problem with her staying all the time alone, and Yoni spending so much time in the army. At the time we were less sympathetic with Tutti because what Yoni did in the army had such an importance in our eyes. He understood that you cannot be there, you cannot excel there, without pouring all of yourself into it. And the demands of a young lady who married you, and she expect you to be with her, not just to come late at night and to fall asleep beside her. We never really discussed what happened. I was depressed and I may have been, subconsciously, you know, resentful that he wasn't there. That I was schlepping it alone, and so on. We were all so protective of each other. Maybe we didn't talk about things partly in order not to hurt each other. "Dear Mother and Father, "Tutti and I have separated. "It's hard for me to analyze the reasons "for our split, especially as they're not entirely clear to me." It was a very sad period in his life, naturally. Whether you want the divorce or you don't want the divorce, you feel that something that you wanted to succeed failed. "There's no doubt that my serving in the army "is a contributing factor. "It's happened so recently that I myself "am still unable to reach any conclusions, far less see what the end will be." The hijackers put off their deadline to 8 a.m. Sunday after Israel broke it's long-standing policy and agreed to negotiate. This policy change came today when Palestine hijackers in Uganda released 101 more hostages but held the Air France crew of 12, and 98 passengers, under threat of death. The Israelis are frustrated and resigned. Frustrated because there's nothing they can do to influence the situation except give into the hijackers, and resigned to doing just that. We agreed that the official, the formal resolution, will be that we are going to exchange. And it created an atmosphere that helped us to prepare our operation. We've taken this critical decision primarily because of humanitarian reasons, namely, saving the lives of the Israeli hostages in Uganda. If we shall give up our position in the eyes of the world, we'll go down. They'll say, "Here is a country "that says you have to fight terror, but when it comes to your place you will not." If we shall try and succeed, it will be tremendous victory. Thursday morning it became clear that there is going to be some ultimatum, so we had to plan within a very tight limit something that had never been done before, and take responsibility and go and execute it. We called back Yoni from Sinai, because he was busy conducting a special operation on the other side of the canal in Egypt. When you start to plan, we will ensure that we are going to take the whole airport. And then to free the hostages. After several times we realized that the right way, it's like a bank robbery. You are going only to the safe, taking the money out. You are not controlling the whole bank. He didn't have any hesitations. He looked upon it almost as a normal operation. April 18th, 1972. "Dear Mother and Father, "after 4 1/2 years of married life, "it's hard to get used to living alone "without the woman one loves. "But it seems that one can get used to anything. "In your letters, you expressed concern. "I've long since passed the age of needing protection, "and I manage very well on my own. "But it's still good to know "that in case I do need assistance, there'll be someone who would understand and help." Dani and me rented a house. We invited Yoni to join us, and stay with us at that villa. And he did it. And Yoni was more absent than present, because he was extremely busy. We hardly saw him. But when he came he was talking about the life in the army. Of course, he couldn't talk a lot, because it's a super-secret mission. He had missions all the time. On the eve of Yom Kippur of 1973, we played Diplomacy, the war game, just before World War I. Yoni was my ally. And on the most dramatic moment when I really had to rely on him, he actually stabbed me in the back and he betrayed me. And I was so shocked and insulted personally. I said to him, "Yoni, how can you make it to me? I was your ally." He said to me, "Dani, that's life. That's reality. That's the game." The next day the war broke. War erupts in the Mideast as Egypt and Syria attack Israel on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. Twenty-five years for the state of Israel. So little, and yet so much. How sad that we cannot achieve peace, for that is all we want at the end. What kind of godforsaken world are we living in? It contains so much beauty, so much grandeur and nobility. And men destroy everything that is beautiful in the world. There was a mission to the unit to go directly to the Golan Heights to help the forces there. To receive the Syrian attack. A company of Syrian commander landed with helicopters very close to the post. And Yoni with his force immediately came to get in touch with them. And as they came to the place where they thought they spotted the Syrian landing... ...and suddenly there was a burst of gunfire. And everybody dropped to the ground. They surprise us face-to-face again, the commanding troops. So at the beginning I didn't see anybody. And then I saw Yoni ahead of me, leading a group of soldiers. He set, like he did all the time, he set the example. Very calm, very...not running. As it needs to be. You see your commander and say, "Okay, if he is going now I'll join him." And he started moving forward. And everybody-- Just pulled everybody behind him. And went over the Syrian lines. And overcame them. They were outnumbered and attacked from superior positions, and lost only two or three men. And that was entirely due to his leadership. He did close combat with extraordinary results. To kill at such very close range isn't like hanging a gun from a hundred yards away. That's something I had already done when I was young. I've learned since how to kill at close range, too. Pressing the muzzle against the flesh and pulling the trigger. The body muffling the sound of the shot. It adds a whole dimension of sadness to a man's being. Not a momentary transient sadness, but something that sinks in and endures. The Yom Kippur war affected him, I think, more on a grand scale. I think he saw that there was a certain lack of holding power in Israel for anything that's long and drawn out. This has been the hardest war we've known. At least it was more intense, more costly in dead and wounded. More marked with failures and successes than any of the wars and battles I have known. We're all searching for a different place, a beautiful and glowing place. A place worth waking up in. The world is full of beauty, and the ugliness in it only highlights that beauty. Bruria, she was, at that time, a secretary. A very good secretary. A very beautiful, handsome girl. One day she came to me and told me... I want to go to the best battalion that you have. And he said, "You should go to-- "And there is a new commander there. And I think it's good for you." I don't want to say I fell in love the minute I saw him, because it would sound stupid. But there was something in the minute I saw him. Bruria was a very free-spirited woman. And Yoni was an army man. A commander, a tough guy. I was young and very enthusiastic about life. And he didn't think about himself, that he can again fall in love, be devoted to love, open himself to love. He didn't feel it to me at all for the first four months. I was doing paperwork, organizing things for him. On his bed you could see the poets he read. When you see it, that somebody that deals with army all the time, his private time is poetry. And it was amazing. And I decided that I have to make him love me. And I worked on it. I don't want to... I worked on it. And in the end, it happened. "Bruria, mine, "I love you very much. "I say it with a cry and with sombreness "and with longing. "And I love, with almost unbearable restraint. "You're the axis around which I turn. "Sometimes I circle around very close, "and sometimes the circle is very wide. "But always round and round you, the centre." Sometimes he showed me the notes he would leave for her. He all the time said about her, "My love, my wife." There was a good chemistry between us. We talked a lot. We hugged a lot. I... I was in paradise. "Bruria, I've been thinking "of how to change my way of life "so that we can live together like a normal couple "and, as yet, have not found a solution. "I am thinking of the future. "Maybe there, in the future, the real key lies." "Dear Bibi, it's fairly certain I'll get command of the unit "and start the overland quite soon. "I like the idea of returning to the unit, and I'm anxious to get there as soon as possible." He had a reputation of being a great combat commander. Proven, you know, in many, many situations. Whenever there was a very difficult drill physically, he took part of it. It's not common. It's not common the commander of the unit is taking part in all the difficult drills. And he would be there to try to push us to see that we would go beyond what we thought were our limits, and break the barriers every single time. And do the impossible. And, you know, very often we felt we knew better. And I think that created some friction. Yoni wasn't cut from the stuff that people from the unit are made of. His father was a professor, and he spent some times in the United States. And he was different from the other people in the unit. His personality was more complexed. And... And I think it didn't make things easier for him and it didn't make things easier for us. "Dear Mother and Father, "the army burdens me with an enormous load of work, "and doesn't allow me a minute for my private affairs. "There is a real satisfaction in this kind of work, "but it's immensely tiring. "Nearly 11 years have passed since I left home for the army, "and I am seized by a longing for family togetherness. "I look back on breakfasts in the kitchen "with you and Bibi and Iddo, "on Passover nights "or the lighting of the Hanukkah candles. "I halt the frantic rush forward "and all that still needs to be accomplished. "I plunge into the past, "into the warmth of a loving family. "It's a world of its own, a world of an enchanted child." He was a complicated man with internal conflicts, with difficulties. And still had the huge responsibility on his shoulders in such a young age. The intensity of the way that he approached things, I think also exhausted him. On one hand achieving and going into unachievable heights. And on the other hand, not getting and possessing the simple things that make people happy. "Bruria, I find myself at a critical stage in my life, "facing a profound inner crisis "that's been disturbing my whole frame of reference "for a long time. "Until now, the only solution "suggested ploughing the same deep furrow "in the same field. "My work possesses me, and I don't want it to. "I do things because they have to be done. "The same haunting question returns: "Can I work like this and wear myself out? "And the answer is always, 'I must persevere "and finish what I've begun.' "Good that I have you, my Bruria. "And good that I have somewhere to lay my weary head. "I know I'm not with you enough, "and that it's hard for you to be alone so much, "but I trust you, me, both of us, "to succeed in living our youth to the fullest. "You to live your youth and your life, "and I, my life and the flicker of my youth. It will be okay." Israeli government ministers work into the Jewish Sabbath on negotiations for the release of about 100 Israelis and other Jews from Palestinian hijackers in Uganda. Today they assembled their remaining 110 hostages in small groups and surrounded them with dynamite to await Sunday's deadline. Time was running out, and the fear, anxiety and frustration of the relatives of the Israeli hostages held at Entebbe spilled out into an angry outpouring of emotions. "Give the hijackers what they want," they screamed. "Just let our loved ones come back alive." Well, the prime minister, he felt that he's the man responsible for their lives. They came to him to talk, says look, save our children. The entire operation had to be prepared in about 48 hours. The unit basically is not working this way. In the unit you will prepare an operation for a long time, and when it is ready, you go. Yoni worked very hard. He didn't let any detail go away. Didn't sleep all night, and stayed in the office. And then in the morning the plan was ready. And here we are talking about, we are Friday. We know that the next day, Saturday, we are going to fly to Entebbe to an unbelievable raid. Very limited time. Planning is doing on the fly. And planning is not good as it should be. We look to movies from Entebbe of Idi Amin's army. And in one of the movies, we saw a black Mercedes. It seemed to be a good idea to use vehicles that are similar to what they have, to use uniforms, to use some camouflage. To give the impression, at least for a few minutes, that this is part of the Uganda army. The final plan was to come with four Herculeses. The first one with the two jeeps and the black Mercedes of Sayeret Matkal. They have enough soldiers in order to storm the main terminal. And to kill all the terrorists around. And to take the hostages back home. The first time that this thought maybe this is going to occur, is after the final simulation exercise. The chief of staff said he's going to give his approval and recommendations to the government to carry out that separation. The prime minister, he wasn't convinced about assurance that these boys can negotiate 4000 kilometres away from home, to cross different countries. Our planes were unarmed, weren't fighters. It was cargo planes. The entire operation, it was something beyond the horizon to fly one way several thousand miles from here. Nobody did it before. We were professional soldiers. And we felt that the simulation is, you know, it's maybe good showoff, to show the chief of staff. But we feel that, you know, we are actors in a movie. It's nothing. A lot of information is coming in, and lots of confusion and information that contradict the other information. So everything is quite chaotic. And Yoni gathered all of us, the assault team. We'd been about 30 or 32 guys, that's all. And he explained what should we focus about. You should get prepared for surprises from all directions. Concentrate on the mission. We are not there in order to kill soldiers. We are there in order to free the hostages. I think he trusted two things: first of all, he trusted us more than we trusted ourselves. And the second thing, he trusted himself. I'm sure that he felt that his best performance is under fire. And whatever will happen, he felt that leading us, things will be okay. You are educating people to risk their life against their instincts, and that the only way is to lead by personal example. And that's what he did all his life. Yoni, before taking off, he came to me. He said, "Look, if I will not come back from the operation, "I'm serious, you are my friend. Take care of Bruria." It was like yesterday. We got onto the plane, took off from Sharm al-Sheikh towards Entebbe. The government was still debating whether the operation would be approved or not. And we told him, "Yoni, no chance for the operation to be approved. Don't worry." The last leg was a very long one. Surprisingly, most of the people in the unit never been out of Israel in their life. So this was the longest flight for almost everyone there. Yoni came out and he told us, "The government approved the operation." And then we started to panic. You look around your friends. You ask yourself, "Okay, who will be alive and who will be dead when we go back?" We got closer to Entebbe. It was almost midnight. There was a thunderstorm outside. And the airplane was very dark. And at that moment of time, Yoni went all the way from the rear of the Hercules to the front part. And he stopped and he smiled to each troop, and shook hands or touched the shoulder of everybody. I never experienced it before, or any other commander doing the same. When the airplane touched the ground and the door was opened... and we went out. And I remember the silence. There was no noise anymore. And then I remember the darkness. There was no light anymore. And then I remember that I was frightened because of, you know, like every kid, silence and darkness. We see the Ugandan guards as we're driving towards the terminal building. I see the guard on the right side. He was aiming to shoot at us. Yoni and the officer who's sitting behind him pulled out the handguns that we had with silencers on them, and was shooting at the guards. And right after that, we hear a machine gun going off from the jeep behind us. And all of a sudden from quiet, we go into full combat mode. Surprise is over. So you don't think about your life anymore. You don't think about cover anymore. You just run like crazy. And you shoot the terrorists before they shoot the hostages. And then all of a sudden the guy who led the assault team pulled to the left and stopped near the corner of the terminal. And Yoni, he shouts, "Move, move, move, move! Don't stop." He couldn't, like us, kneel against the wall and crawl and walk slowly. He was moving ahead, making all of us follow him. Yoni was running with us. And I saw Yoni stumble. And that was the last that I saw of Yoni. MAN, OVER WALKIE-TALKIE: This is Israel Broadcasting from Jerusalem. All the hostages in Uganda have been rescued by Israeli forces. It seems to me the government of Israel invoked one of the most remarkable rescue missions in history, a combination of guts and brains that has seldom, if ever, been surpassed. Israel has carried out a daring raid for freedom. Crack troops were flown 2300 miles to Uganda for a lightning strike at Entebbe Airport to rescue hostages held for a week by the hijackers of that Air France jetliner. I was doing the week of the bicentennial. We were a group of Israeli students at MIT. We heard in the news that there was an Israeli rescue mission. And that the hostages had been freed, and that one Israeli officer had been killed. I said, "Why did they say one officer?" I was sharing with Bibi my concerns, as I had called him to Boston. I woke him up and told him that I think something might have happened to Yoni. I had a feeling that something's happening. I had this restlessness that there's something I must do urgently, and I don't know what it is. It was very strange. I called the unit and I asked, "What's going on?" And I don't know whose... Who talked with me. I don't know the name of the girl who talked with me. But she said there was something. And I said-- And I asked her about casualties. And she said, "I don't know, I don't know." I think she knew, because I felt something in the... On the telephone. * I went back, I called my wife. Waked her up. And told her the operation succeeded. Yoni is dead. Please go down to Bruria, wake her up and stay with her, because someone will come to inform her, and it's inconceivable to me that she will hear, and tell her what happened, and sit with her until someone comes there. But I said, "How am I going to tell her? I can't look at her. I can't say it." She said-- And he says, "Nava, you need to do it." And then we hung up. And I stayed there for about two hours. I didn't know what to do. I think it was 6:00 when I went down. And I knocked on the door. I didn't think she came to tell me that Yoni died. It was a... a shock. She didn't say it right away. She said something... like it was-- I don't remember exactly the words. And I remember... that the word that was in my head was "why?" I couldn't... I said-- I felt, "Why?" Why? Why should it... Why it's like this? That was the... That's it. It was as though somebody amputated my arms and my legs, and tore a piece of my heart. Yeah. It was just torture. And I'm driving this at night. We came to the place where my parents had lived. And there was a big window in this cottage that they lived in. And my father was walking sort of back and forth... with his hands in a typical stance that he has. You know, behind his back. He's walking back and forth. Ruminating about something. And all of a sudden his face turned and he saw me. And I think he said, "Bibi, what are you doing here?" And then his expression changed and he understood immediately. And... my mother let out a terrible scream. I'll never forget that. It was... It was actually worse than hearing about Yoni's death. Because, in a way, it was their death too. We are all human. Some happy with our lot, some searching and searching. I don't regret the crossroads I've passed. And if there is more beauty, more flowers along the road I didn't take, I still don't regret it, because it wasn't my road. On me, on us, rests the duty of keeping our country safe. We are united by something that is above and beyond political outlook. What unites us produces a feeling of brotherhood. Of mutual responsibility. A recognition of the value of man and his life. A strong and sincere desire for peace. A readiness to stand in the breach, and much more. This is a special people, and it's good to belong to it. *
