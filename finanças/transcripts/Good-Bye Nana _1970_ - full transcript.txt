We, the people of the United Nations, resolve to save future generations from the scourge of war. ... to create the conditions... necessary for the maintenance of justice and respect for obligations. And for these purposes to practice tolerance and live together in peace with each other as good neighbors. Joining forces to maintain international peace and security for all peoples. To reaffirm our belief in fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the individual. I am very flattered by the confidence shown in me. I see it as an incentive. Democracy is the air of life... life... life... life we... breathe. Ding-dong. - Is the minister at home? - Yes. - Where should I put this? - Straight ahead here. - Do I put it down? - It's fine here. - I saw it on TV yesterday. - Me too. It was the one about housing. I have a boy who's been in line for eleven years now. - I was thinking of getting an apartment. - He's not talking about housing. - He is talking about housing policy. - He said they'd build 90,000 in a year? Yes, that's right. Just one small one. Two rooms and kitchen. Reasonable rent. He certainly has a lot of influence, but... - I vote for him. - Me too. - Is he a decent man, I mean privately? - Yes, a lot. - Can I talk to him? - No... Of course. Minister! - Minister! - What is it? It's urgent. It's someone who has been in the housing queue for eleven years. Good day. My name is Svensson. I have a son. He's very kind. He lives in a caravan with his wife and a little boy. I heard about 90,000 apartments. You sounded so helpful. Could you find something suitable? Dear TV viewer, I am very flattered by your trust. But you must understand... You can't come to me. That's what we have the housing agency for. It's a long line, but it's the same for everyone. That's the first principle of social justice. To put it short... Housing production is increasing in intensity. I can send you some statistics and tables. And one day the market will be saturated, if you know what I mean. No. That's basically how it is. Basically. Bye. It's done. Nenna is from Självsvåldet. Nenna is too undisciplined, she sent me a driver who was homeless. - That was nice of her, wasn't it? - I'm not amused by her stupidity. I don't want her in the house. She has to go. Is that what you say? She has to go! It's not the first time. The other day I think it involved some sort of robbery. Some policeman was murdered. And she said it was my influence. I had said something about property distribution. - Didn't you? - No. The emphasis on learning means that you don't see any sharp difference between the normal and the deviant. There's no point in me reading if you're not listening. Focus. The difference lies in the prevailing societal attitude. Not from a mother who is a doctor. - Pediatrician, I want to emphasise. - Forgive me. Where was I? Now I have to leave. Is it that late? Kiss kiss. Drive carefully. Kiss. Yes, yes, yes. Goodbye, Mats-Peter. Hi, Nenna. Take care of yourselves. Not the elbow. Schering! Hello, Schering. Well, have you seen Mats-Peter today? Yes. Oh! - Hello, Schering! - Oh, you little one! Come here now. Do you want me to take you to China? Then you have to put the Tri Nack on me first. Oh really. Bang! You need to hold him. Oh! Yes! - Bye, little man. - Bye. Bye! - Bye! - Bye! We put... Dad, what's this? Would you lend me the hammer for a while? No, no, no! Should you do that? This is how you should do it. It breaks! Watch your fingers! - Test! - Be careful, Mats-Peter. Mr. Minister. This requires a little dexterity, you see. Mr. Minister. What is it? Look, Mats-Peter. Look. Look out. What do you say? It's crazy. What's that? What do you say then? Yes, that's the world. Put on a stick. Can you light it from the inside as well? Can you press a button? Is there electric light inside? - Yes, it's electric. - Would be weird if it wasn't. Where should we put it? Your defense of the housing policy and the high rents on TV yesterday was amazing. By all means. What did you use the tools for? I have bought a globe. I'm giving Mats-Peter some spectator lessons. At his age I was thirsty for knowledge but Mats-Peter is not thirsty for knowledge. He's perhaps a little untalented. Can such parents have an ungifted child? Theoretically, there are no limits at all. This is now land, and the blue here is therefore water. And... what... do we have here? Here is our country. Our little country. In any case, we must feel community and responsibility, for all mankind. The earth is round. The earth is round. The earth is round. The earth is round. That's how one says it: The earth is round. "The earth is round." I have to tell you this: This is a country. People with a very, very advanced culture used to live here. many, many thousands of years ago. Yes, culture, you may not know that, but culture... that is... How do you say it? I don't know. - What do you say? - Nice clothes, Mats-Peter. Now we have a country here, a giant country: China. 600 million inhabitants. 800. And here we have India... ... with unprecedented poverty. How many residents? I don't know. I was taught at school that the widows are usually burned together with their husbands. What women. What men. Forgive me. You'll understand this much better when you grow up. I don't want to grow up. I don't want to understand. Nothing. There's so much you have to do. You can't be small all your life. In any case, I don't want to understand. - Should I make a bird? - Yes do it. Wait, I'm going to tie. He has a good relationship with Nenna, Mats-Peter. Well, then. We don't want him to be attached to his mother. Yeah, he's not going to be attached to his father, is he? Sorry, what did you say? - Hey. - Hey. The earth is not round, because then you have to fall off. It's probably like that anyway. Have you seen it yourself? Then you have to fall into a pit somewhere. If you walk into it. No, I don't really understand that either. That's just the way it is, you learn it at school. I don't want to go to school. You have to. Everyone has to. If I have to do that, then I'll run away. Tell me and I'll come along. That's what I want to do. If you die, I will burn myself. I'm not going to die. Do you fall into a pit when you die? As I said, the world is not a small place. The earth is round. Without limit and without end. I see it as a symbol -- Nenna! Nenna! I can handle it myself. Ouch! Damn it! How will you manage housing construction? This is nothing to joke about. I've seen the x-rays. It's absolutely... the bone is broken. The bone is broken. Forgive me please. You stood in the way. I'll help you. I can do that. The mail has been forwarded. - Hey you! - Hello! Hope you have a good time now. I don't want to go with you to the country. Nenna will take care of you. In a week I'll also go to the countryside. - Bye. - Bye. Have fun. The post office calls. - Bye! - Bye! - Bye. - Goodbye! - Hello! - Hi! - Hello! - Hello! Hello! Here I have some pictures that I developed. It's very good. How exciting! Very good! Nenna! There comes mommy and daddy. Have they already? Have they caught up with us? Yes. But they're not passing. Of course they will pass, but they will drive fast again. That's crazy! But you can't overtake on the left-hand side. Yes, they can pass you there. Why is that? You are allowed. But I think they drive too fast anyway. Yes. They could have collided. Hey, there's a car coming there. Yes, look how many cars are coming here now. Yes. Stop! Oh, finally! Hello! Hello! Where are you going? We're just visiting the sites. Yes that's good. Do you hear the peewits? They sound so sad. Maybe they are afraid. Isn't it beautiful? - But dear, what did you say? - I believe in inquiry and justification. No, but please. You actually have to be careful Beware of jumping to conclusions from the survey. Like... how should I put it? Yes! One mustn't forget that society is moving forward thanks to reassessments and debates. Good night! Good night! Today the sea wasn't beautiful. Take care! We'll be back tomorrow morning. Why does he have to sleep at the Governor's house? Because it's a long way there. Daddy and him have a lot to talk about. Hey you. You must whistle when you pick wild strawberries. There's rain in the air. Shall we go out and face it? Yes! Hello there! Guys, don't go out with that one! It can't handle this wind! Ridiculous, nonsense! Damn idiot, what's that supposed to be good for? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! That's right. The boys don't dare talk about it. She stays behind, too. Oh God! They are actually all good. So beautiful and so alive. To think she'd end up like that. We have to hurry, please. You are helping me. The papers can be here at any time. I don't want to be photographed. Look here. Here is Nenna and you. A beautiful picture. Here you are the two of you in the newspaper. She is adorable. I don't want to be in the newspaper! I don't want to! Calm down. What is it? Mats-Peter! Mats-Peter! Mats-Peter! What are you doing? Please Mats-Peter, please. Calm down. Will you please calm down -- What are you doing? Little beast! Damn it! It's best to leave him alone. How did it go? Yes, are you hurt? Well, I mean the hand. Please stop nagging me. No, no, no. Come. Come Mats-Peter. Come and sit down. It was good. The peace plan and the future. Every hour of silence increases the chances of rational overthinking. Writes English Times in connection with... Remove your hands. Take your hands off! So? Writes English Times in connection with a peace plan outlined... Manners! Now eat your breakfast, Mats-Peter. We have said goodbye to Nenna. I also want to say goodbye to Nenna. But little man, they don't let little kids in like that. Why? I saw when she drowned. They don't let little kids in like that. I also want to say goodbye to Nenna. But now listen to what we say, Mats-Peter. It's not possible. Why? I want to! Be quiet! You treat him as you want and I as I want. It is important to get a grip on him. He has been in Nenna's hands for too long. Getting his way in everything. He has never had to consider anyone but himself. But there are more people on earth than him. He has to adjust to that. - Do you? - Yes. - Do you? -Yes! Yes I do! Hello Mats-Peter! Where are you going today? Come in, do you want an ice cream? What're you doing here little friend? There are no sick people here. They are in the big house. But you must be at least 15 years old to visit someone who is sick. Nenna is here. This is the place of the dead. Nenna is dead. She drowned. Come, may I speak to you. - What's your name? - Mats-Peter. Why do you want to say goodbye to Nenna? Because I want to. Do your mom and dad know you're here? No. Haven't you asked them for permission to say goodbye to Nenna? Yes. What did they say then? They are stupid. Follow me. I'll wait outside here. Hi Nenna. Hi Nenna. Ouch! What have you done? Were you thinking of setting yourself on fire? Yes. Is that what you thought? Yes. Does it hurt? No. Come on, I'll dress it. Bye Nenna. Mats-Peter! - Is that your mother? - Yes. Where have you been? With Nenna. Now don't say anything hastily. What do we know about his grief? Rushed? Yes. Sit down. Listen. Do you carry matches in your pocket? Yes. Today. Do you see. Small children mustn't carry matches in their pockets. Then they may be tempted to play with fire. Now promise me never to walk with matches in your pocket again. Do you promise it? No. Don't you understand what I'm saying? You mustn't carry matches in your pockets. Do you understand? Yes. Now promise never to do it again. No. No more matches. Do you hear that?! I will kill you. - I will kill you! - No! - I will kill you! - No! Mats-Peter. Open, please. Daddy is in town. Can I come in? Hello. You must be hungry. Shouldn't we eat? The two of us. I want your company. Daddy is stupid. All people are stupid. Sometimes. Why do you say that, Mats-Peter? That daddy is stupid? Daddy said Nenna had to go. So, you heard that? Otherwise I wouldn't know, would I? Do you mean it's daddy's fault? That Nenna drowned? Mhm? Now I'm full. I think you can answer a question anyway. Thank you for the food. You're welcome. Where are you going? Out. Where are you going? I won't go without my car. Daddy is stupid. Come on, can I talk to you for a minute? Daddy has been in town. There daddy met two famous men. Who had a difficult problem. Politically. And significant to a lot of people if you know what I mean. They had been dealing with that problem for months. But daddy solved it in ten minutes. Sometimes daddy even sits at the king's council table. You have to understand that daddy is by no means stupid. Daddy is stupid. Come here for a minute. Wait! Wait, what are you doing? - What's going on here? - It's about Mats-Peter's upbringing. You and I will talk about that matter in private. I don't know if we want any female involvement. You and your non-violence sermon. Bye! You are pretty when you are angry. Yes, it's not serious. It's just a little show of strength. But your appearance turns me backwards. Yes, but we are crazy. Nothing is normal anymore. Millions of people trust my word. And Mats-Peter wouldn't trust me, his own father. This isn't a political issue. All people can be convinced. It must also be true for him. Or is our son an imbecile? Or more clever, what do we know? He doesn't trust us, he doesn't trust us. Don't you get it? Aren't you exaggerating now? It is the quality of you and me that matters now. And not his. Dear Nenna. It is said that those whom the gods love die young. You came to us when our little boy was born. You were our friend. Mats-Peter, you don't do that. Come now. Come now. Come now. Come with me. Continue. Nenna is out there. Somewhere. Perhaps. But she is where we can't see her. Good night. One for me. Strong. Is he sleeping? Yes. With Nenna's photograph next to him. Imagine if you could stay at home and take care of Mats-Peter and me. For a hundred thousand a year. Minus tax. Yes. I agree with that. On one condition. Say it. Say it. I agree to anything. We draw lots. It's weird. In my work, I mean quite a lot actually to a lot of children, but... ...to my own child I mean nothing. It's strange. You actually mean a lot to me too. There is no human being who can have nearly as much influence as you. What I love most about you... ...is that behind everything there is something that is so full of integrity. So... Shall we go down and pick up the bags now? Yes, the ones you put in the hall. - Did I? - Yes you did. Did I? - Did I? - You did. Who the hell calls at six in the morning? Seven, two, one, one, two, zero... One. Seven, two, one, one, two, zero, one. The ad, yes. My God, you don't need to call in the middle of the night for that. Well yes, by all means, you can talk to... Hello? Hello? No, there is no one left in the facility. Now leave the phone alone and I'll take all the calls today. If you want to fundamentally change the current society and replace it with something diametrically different you become active in the debate. In addition, these are perceived... Please, we're on vacation. In addition, these are perceived principally different perceptions as interesting. Now we're going to make the beds, all three of us. I'll sit in the garden and read the paper. No, no, no. You're going to vacuum so I'll take the upstairs. You can take the downstairs. Since there is only one vacuum cleaner… ...then I'll take the newspaper first. And then I do the dishes. What, what, what? Mats-Peter, have you unplugged the phone? Yes. No, but you must have someone to look after you. Yeah, maybe I can eat a sandwich. No. You must have real food. Huh? Can I live alone? You can't and you shouldn't talk back to me. Mats-Peter, if you don't help me... ...then I can't help sick children get well. You can try if mommy asks you to, can't you? I can do that. Henrietta Mandelsborn lives in the castle made of butter... ...with fences made of good wafers and floors made of gingerbread. She has a bedroom in Ammaring. Mats-Peter, the toilet is on the left out there, and then left again. When she goes out on the town, she has her hat made of doughnut... ...decorated with jam and marzipan, and freshly made chocolate bow. We're actually going out today, me and my little face. We're actually going out today, me and my little face. We're actually going out today, me and my little face. We're actually going out today, me and my little face. We are actually going to… I can fish, too. Can you? Yes, come and sit here then. So let's keep company. Are you a hobo? Mm, you could say that. What profession are you in? I'm running away. Do you? How long will you be away then? Until dinner perhaps? Well, you are. - Now it bites! - Yes, that's what I said. You bring luck. What a big whopper, eh? Mats-Peter has disappeared! Yes, one could imagine that. The nursery thing was far too simple. You should take it easy after eating. Mats-Peter! Then the peace was over. It's mommy! We got food, we cooked it. It was great. Come mommy. Thanks for the help. Thanks for the help. Come with me, Mats-Peter. Okay then. Can't he live with us? No, that won't work. But can't you come home with us and have a bite to eat? Fine with me. Thank you, thank you, dear lady. But with all the people in the world, you probably don't have the stomach to eat lunch twice a day. Thank you so much for taking care of Mats-Peter. - Bye. - Bye. Ma'am, that money might come in handy. How kind of you. Most gladly. Thanks so much. Thanks so much. - Bye. - Come with me, come. Bye. - Hi Schering. - Hi Mats-Peter. - Is your vacation over now? - Yes. How nice to see you. How are you? Good. You're so brown. - How are you? - Yes, thanks, I'm fine. Isn't Nenna at home? No. What is it? What's with you? Has something happened? Nenna drowned. What? What are you saying? Has Nenna drowned? Yes. Has it been in the newspaper? Yes. Are you home alone? Yes. Nenna. Oh my God. I saw it myself. Can't you walk? No. Is it difficult to drive? Should I try? Yes do it. How does it work? Wait, I'll show you. Lift that one up. Yes. No, it... The handbrake. Here, Mats-Peter. Oh, it's going well. Oh! - Don't you have door thresholds? - No, not necessary. How nice. It's fun huh? - Hello, Mats-Peter! - Hello! Have you been out? Yes. Yes, I've called several times but no one answered. It's because I've been out. Another night it doesn't work. Every time the locomotive runs into it, it stops. I'll buy a new one tomorrow. It can be fixed. Wasn't it boring to be alone? It was. Weren't you afraid then? What for? I long for you so terribly. Are you hungry? Have you eaten anything? I've eaten, that's why I'm not hungry. Mats-Peter. That's it. You're welcome. And then the sink. The sink. So. And then the fridge. The fridge, yes. - Well, you will stay for breakfast, right? - Yes thank you. Yes, I thought so. Then we add one more egg. Huh? Right? Right. M-A-T-S. Mats. P-E-T-E-R. Peter. Mats, Peter. I can't read, I said. If you remove S from Mats, it becomes food. But what will happen to Peter? If you remove P, E and R. Surely it's tea? I don't like tea. No, I like coffee much better. Do you put it together when you talk too? Yes, you do. My honorable opponent seems to be hovering in unfortunate ignorance of… And it is very embarrassing to have to mention it. ...in unfortunate ignorance of the principles which in and of themselves... ...are relevant where applicable... ...as in all others... ...and thus comparable... Namely... Firstly... We apologize for the interruption. We will get back to you as soon as the issue is resolved. You didn't get too much. No I don't think so. What a serious boy you are. I don't think he has any sense of humor. He almost never laughs. Do you know what humor is, Mats-Peter? No. Can the gentlemen define humor without help? Whoever has humor cannot define it. Whoever can define it doesn't have it. It's really simple. Yes, but yes... Attention: Here is a government declaration on humor. Let's have fun tonight, not that tone. I feel thirsty. I'm so worried about Mats-Peter. I must be allowed to go home. No, no. I want to go home. Mats-Peter! Mats-Peter! Mats-Peter! Mats-Peter! NENNA IS DEAD DADDY IS STUPID MOMMY IS MOMY SATAN SATAN MATS PETER Mommy... Mommy... Mommy, are you home? I wasn't really feeling well, so I had to go home. I'm sitting here recovering a bit. How did you know I was home? It smells like perfume. Are you still up? I was at Sandra's watching TV. Sandra? Where does she live? At the bottom of our street in the smallest house. In that small, sweet house with the flowers, where Nenna used to visit? Yes. Are you hungry? Maybe a sandwich would be good. And a cup of chocolate. Come! Do you believe in God? Has Sandra talked about it? Yes. - What did she say then? - Nothing. I'll ask first. Do you believe in God? No, I don't. But who made the world? This is what I believe. The world started out as a bunch of little pieces. Atoms. It was like porridge and one day the porridge started to move. And then it exploded. And so the world came into being. Do you believe that? Yes. Why not? If you believe in porridge, you can believe in God too, right? And now he has had another attack. What shall we do? Yes, what can we do? If I know Don Quixote, nothing can stop him from riding out again in a year. Unless he gets too old and feeble for adventure. And then Don Quixote says: I will never become that. We haven't seen the end yet. Read it one more time. Hi. Hi. Do you live here? - What's your name? - Mats-Peter. What's your name? My name is Jan. Well, what about traveling to Africa? I won't travel to Africa. You won't? But your mom and dad are going to Africa. Don't you know that? No. Certainly. They are going to Africa to help build a developing country. Your mother will work there as a pediatrician. Didn't they tell you? No. In any case, I'm not going along. Don't you like your mom and dad? Why? They're so talented. I only like Nenna and Sandra and Shering. But... What if they say you have to? Then I'll run away. Yes, but do you think they'll travel without you then? If they are traveling. You! Mats-Peter! Take care of them, if you run away. - You're not coming along to Africa then? - No. Bye! Bye. Mats-Peter. Mats-Peter, it's mother. I want to tell you something. I already know. I should have talked about it earlier. I wanted to prepare it first. At least it's out now, I don't know how. I don't want to come along. Shall we travel without you? Yes. Won't you miss us? Mama, come now and take Mats-Peter with you. Come in. They want to photograph us all. I don't want to be photographed. Well then. Then you don't have to. Mats, come! We'll take a picture! We take this off. Here. Here we have Mats-Peter himself. You look slightly happier than at the funeral. Will you look at the photographer? You shouldn't have done that. Mats-Peter, what do you want? I want a divorce. You want a divorce? I have money. Can I come in? Yes. Thanks. Now let's talk about this properly. Yes. Why don't you like them? I don't know. Do they hit you? No. But where will you go when mom and dad go away? You can't live alone in the house. I will have to move to Sandra. Do you like Sandra and Shering? Yes. But don't you think mom and dad will be sad if you don't come along? No. Not daddy. Yes, this is difficult, Mats-Peter. You understand that there is such a thing as laws, and we must all obey them. Even the king must obey the laws. And the laws, they say that parents have the right to decide over their children. Do you understand how difficult it is? Yes. What do you think will happen if your parents say to you, Mats-Peter, now you go along and that's it? Then I'll run away. Yes, then you'll run away, yes. Yes, I'll take this case. Let's see what I can do. I'll keep the money for now. Are we in agreement then? Yes. Then I thank you for the trust and the assignment. No, it was nothing. I don't recognize you tonight, you're so quiet. Yes, I've noticed that too. Look, if they needed lawyers in Africa, you could sign up. But they have plenty of lawyers down there. Is that enough for you? Thank you. Yes, I really got something to think about. A bit of a complicated legal case, I don't really know how to tackle the problem. Let's put our heads together. In my profession, you learn to see the core of complex issues. The only problem is that I find myself in conflict with a couple of old friends, if I accept the case. Typical. Duty above all else. Duty above all else. Do you have to take care of it? Well, I'm probably the only one who can do that, I'm afraid. You must follow your conscience. Yes I think so too. Well, that's what you say. Yes, then we agree on that point. You could say that it is about power and right. The stronger has the power and the weaker has the right, as usual. Moreover, the stronger party has the law on his side and I'd say he's going to win the game. He probably thinks I'm a bit ridiculous too. if I take the weaker side. I go against my innermost nature when power tramples justice under its feet. What do you say? When I have a patient in front of me, I go against my innermost nature. I see it as a collective, I see it as an individual. No, but to the point? This applies to the relationship between parents and children. Or rather, between father and son. A lawyer may not be the right -- Sorry, I have a question here. Is it about Mats-Peter? Mats-Peter? Is it about Mats-Peter? What do you mean by that? What would Mats-Peter... It's about Mats-Peter. Good God in heaven. What has he come up with now? He wants to divorce you. He has hired me as his lawyer. He's so enterprising. So adorable. We shouldn't take this too lightly. He was very serious. He refuses to come with you to Africa. Childishness. He's afraid to travel. What does he know about Africa? What can you do by the way? Not much. But a fairly long practice has taught me to find loopholes in government regulations. At worst, I could cause a public scandal. I can put the opponents' press on you. You're stabbing me in the back. Our long-standing friendship means nothing. You have to take risks in my profession too. Duty above all else, didn't you say that? But my God, I had no idea what it was about. Divorce from us, did he say that? I don't know what we're going to do. It's completely ridiculous! Listen, I'm not a dead rat yet! There is not one child welfare officer in the country who dares to open his mouth. I just have to press a button! Power and right, you mean? Maybe we should go home? No, you must stay. He's got something to think about. It doesn't hurt. Semicolon. No, exclamation mark. Yes, the way the opposition has always acted. Mats-Peter. Mats-Peter. Go ahead. And that today I could speak with angels'... Is Mats-Peter here? He's not at home. Isn't he consulting his lawyer? Oh yes, yes. No, he's not here. No. Here? No, not at this hour. - Sandra? - Yes. Do you want to come here for a while? So. Good evening. And good evening. - I apologize for disturbing you like this. - No, it's alright. - I am Mats-Peter's mother. - Yes I see that. I come in such a hurry because he's not at home. I had hoped that he was here with you. Look he... He used to say that he wanted to run away because he didn't want to go to Africa. But... Where can he be? Take your bike and ride around the block and see if you can find him. Yes, I'll just put something on. I'll take the car and drive around. Thanks. I'll just go home and inform him. Thanks so much. Mats-Peter! Mats-Peter! No I can't. I'm going home to Sandra. Is it Mats-Peter's? Where did you find it? In the lifeboat. One oar was gone. They will start dredging at dawn. But the current is strong there. We can do no more. We have to go home. No, I don't want to go home. I don't want to go home. I don't want to go home. I have to stay here. I have to stay here. Mats-Peter! Yes, hello? Yes. A moment. It's from the press. A moment. Yes it's me. No, I don't know that. No, I don't know. I don't know that. I can't answer that. Will you excuse me? One day this summer... Mats-Peter and I... We had an argument. He said, "I will kill you." "I will kill you." He said. Is he alive? He's asleep, good God. - Are you coming? - No. I think it's best for you to be on your own now. - Good night. - Thanks. I should hit the sack. I have to work in a couple of hours. Of course. Thanks. How can we thank you? Thank you very much. He doesn't want to come with us. He shouldn't have to. Should he stay with Sandra and Shering? Yes. You mean we should give him up without further ado? Without further ado. It's a humiliation. What whould people think? Yes, that's one way to look at it. I called the police and told them that he... ...had been found. Do you know what they answered? "Well, that's good." Huh? Our little boy is alive, thank God. Answer, yes? Do you understand what I mean? How can you react so callously? After all, it's about a human life. I'm not being hysterical, but if you keep going like this then I'll scream. English subtitles by faxeholm1234 and DreamScape
