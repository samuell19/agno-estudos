AND I DO WHAT I HAVE TO FOR MY CUSTOMERS. - DO YOU HAVE TO DRESS UP LIKE A STOP SIGN? - IT'S ALL PART OF THE IMAGE. - IT'S NOT YOU. - NOW, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ME? - I KNOW WE BOTH COME FROM THE SAME PLACE, AND WE DON'T TALK LIKE L'IL ABNER. TURNING YOUR DADDY INTO A JOKE-- HOW COULD YOU? YOU'RE A SINGER. YOU SOUNDED LIKE A SALESMAN. - I'M SWEET-TALKING, HONEY, JUST LIKE MY PA. HE USED TO SAY, "YOU MAKE A NICKEL ANY WAY YOU CAN." - HE MADE IT BY PLAIN HARD WORK. I REMEMBER YOUR DADDY. HE WEREN'T ALL SWEET TALK. [owl hoots] [footsteps departing] [owl hooting] [zipper opens] DILLARD, I'M SORRY IF I SOUNDED OFF ABOUT YOUR CONCERT. I JUST LIKE THE WAY YOU USED TO SING-- JUST YOUR VOICE AND THE GUITAR. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. - IT WOULDN'T PAY THE RENT. GIVE ME A HAND? - WHAT'S THAT? - HECKIE AND SUSIE... A PRESENT FOR THEIR GRANDMA. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE FIRST THING SHE SEES WHEN SHE WAKES UP. THEY'D HAVE KILLED ME IF I FORGOT. - WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE BROUGHT THE KIDS WITH YOU. AND SHERYL TOO. - YOU DON'T KNOW SHERYL. - WHAT'S SHE LIKE? - FASTEST CREDIT CARD IN THE SOUTH. - WHAT'S THAT MEAN? - NOTHIN'. SHERYL'S A CITY GAL. SHE LIKES THINGS EASY. MA COULD USE SOME OF THAT. WISH I COULD GET HER TO COME TO FLORIDA. - TO LIVE? - YOU KNOW A FELLA NAMED PRINCE CARPENTER? - WE'VE MET. WHY? - HE WAS UP HERE TODAY, MADE AN OFFER FOR THE PLACE. - DON'T YOU LISTEN TO HIM. HIM AND HIS RUBY RIDGE. YOU KNOW THAT DEVELOPMENT? - WELL, SURE. - I WAS BORN OVER THERE. FOUR GENERATIONS, WE FARMED THAT LAND. THEN MA DIED. PRINCE CARPENTER TALKED MY DADDY INTO SELLING OUT. THEY BUILT FANCY HOMES FOR SUMMER PEOPLE ALL OVER OUR MOUNTAIN. AND BARBED WIRE TO KEEP THE HILLBILLIES OUT. - THOSE KIDS I TEACH, I WANT THEM SMART ENOUGH TO KEEP THEIR OWN LAND, 'CAUSE ONCE IT'S GONE, YOU CAN NEVER GET IT BACK. DON'T LET AUNT ANNIE SELL, DILLARD. DON'T LET PRINCE SHOVE HER OUT. - MA DON'T SHOVE EASY. SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS, ALWAYS DID. SO DID PA. [chuckles] TWO PEOPLE AND A PIECE OF GROUND--THAT'S ALL IT TOOK. - THEN DON'T LET HER SELL THE PIECE OF GROUND. - IT AIN'T THAT SIMPLE. - NO. I SUPPOSE IT COULD HELP YOU A LOT, YOU AND SHERYL. - WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? - TWO KIDS TO TAKE CARE OF-- HER WORKING, YOU TRAVELING ALL THE TIME. - IF I WANTED SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF MY KIDS, IT WOULDN'T BE A 79-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE, NEVER BEEN IN A SUPERMARKET OR A BUS. THE THING IS, THERE WOULD BE SOMEONE TO LOOK AFTER HER. SHE'D BE SAFE. - SAFE FROM WHAT? THIS IS HER HOME, DILLARD. YOU'VE FORGOTTEN HOW IT FEELS. - NO, I AIN'T. - SHE'S LIVED HERE ALL HER LIFE, AND THIS ISN'T SUCH A BAD PLACE TO DIE. - ALL ALONE UP HERE? - SHE'S GOT GOOD FRIENDS, MORE THAN SHE'D HAVE IN FLORIDA. THE NORTONS, ME, LOTS OF PEOPLE. AND SHE HAS YOUR PA. - COME OFF IT, HOLLY. HE AIN'T REAL. - WELL, SO WHAT? MAYBE HE MEANS MORE TO HER THAN INDOOR PLUMBING. - MA'S ALIVE, AND SO IS HER FAMILY. - I JUST MEAN, DON'T PUSH TOO HARD DILLARD. I KNOW YOU LOVE HER, BUT IS LEAVING HERE WHAT SHE WANTS OR YOU WANT? - NOW, THAT'S MY BUSINESS, AIN'T IT? - YES, IT IS. IT'S YOUR BUSINESS. GOOD NIGHT, DILLARD.

YOU LEARN IT BY DOING IT! YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO STUDY FARMING, YOU KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN RIGHT HERE. SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME I TURN ROUND, YOU'RE PICKIN' AT THAT THING.

SUSIE WASN'T MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT WHEN YOU DIED. DILLARD'S CHANGED, TOO. YOU NEVER SEEN THAT, NEITHER. - HE'S STUDYING DIVORCE, AIN'T HE? NOW, WHAT'S THAT? "YOU TAKE THE TABLE, I'LL TAKE THE CHAIR." [chuckles] "WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS? YOU TAKE AN ARM, I'LL TAKE A LEG?" HE'S JUST COON HUNTING AGAIN. - WHATEVER HE'S DOING, THERE'S TWO YOUNG'UNS TO BE CARED FOR. - THEY'RE GROWING SOMEPLACE ELSE. YOU AND ME WAS PLANTED HERE. - "TO EVERYTHING, THERE IS A SEASON. "A TIME TO BE BORN, A TIME TO DIE. "A TIME TO PLANT, AND A TIME TO PICK UP THAT WHICH IS PLANTED." - I THOUGHT YOU WAS NO HAND AT QUOTING THE BIBLE. - GO AWAY, PLEASE, HECTOR. I GOT TO FIGURE THIS OUT FOR MY OWN MYSELF. IT'S ALL EASY FOR YOU NOW. - WELL... THERE'S NOTHING LIKE DAYLIGHT BETWEEN THE RIBS TO CLEAR A MAN'S MIND. - YOU AIN'T STILL HERE. IT'S THE KIDS THAT'S STILL HERE. YOU WENT AWAY FIVE YEARS AGO. YOU GOT SO SICK... YOU LEFT ME. I WATCHED YOU GO. - I HEAR YOU'RE JUST OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, MR. NATIONS.

SHE'S WRITING ABOUT US IN HER SCHOOL MAGAZINE. - ABOUT THE OLD DAYS. - OH. - HOW DID YOU LIKE BEING OVER THERE IN HIGHLANDS? - I DIDN'T. JUST CAN'T STAND THE TOWNS. NO ROOM. - COULD YOU SPEAK UP A LITTLE, SIR? - I SAID I DON'T LIKE A TOWN! - THAT'S FINE. YOU THINK YOU'LL RETIRE NOW? - HOW'S THAT? - [loudly] DO YOU STILL WORK THE PLACE? - WELL, I-- - PA DON'T HEAR TOO GOOD WHEN HE DON'T WANT TO. - WHAT DID HE SAY? - HE SAID YOU OUGHT TO TAKE IT EASY. YOU'VE BEEN POORLY. - SO...I'VE BEEN POORLY. WELL, I DON'T AIM TO SLACK OFF NONE. WHEN THE LORD MADE A MAN, HE MADE HIM GOOD! HE MADE HIM TOUGH. AND...THIS OLD BODY'S REALLY PUT TOGETHER, BUDDY. YOU CAN'T HARDLY TEAR IT APART, IT'S SO WELL PUT TOGETHER. AND I'M GOING TO LIVE JUST AS LONG AS I SEE ANYBODY ELSE LIVING! [slaps table] - YEAH. THERE AIN'T NOBODY CAN'T SAY NOTHING ABOUT THAT. - WHAT YOU KNITTING, MA? - SOCKS. I'M BOUND TO HAVE SOMETHING IN MY FINGERS TO OCCUPY MY MIND. - GOT SOCKS HERE THAT'D DO A CENTIPEDE. - HOW MANY CHILDREN HAVE YOU GOT, MRS. NATIONS? - YOU CALL ME AUNT ANNIE, CHILD. EVERYONE ELSE DOES. I HAD FIVE. - LET'S SEE... NO, I ASKED YOU THAT. OH, MY TEACHER WANTED THIS ONE. [button clicks] [loudly] IS IT A PROBLEM HERE, KIDS GOING OFF AND FAMILIES SELLING OUT? - YEAH. - WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WHEN YOU QUIT SCHOOL? - I'M GONNA BE A TEACHER. - HERE? - [chuckles] I LIKE IT HERE. DON'T YOU? - NOW, YOU STICK TO THAT. IT'S WHERE YOU BELONG, WHAT YOU VALUE. - I GUESS THIS PLACE IS MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD, ISN'T IT? - WHAT IS? - THIS PLACE. - MM, I DIDN'T SAY THAT. - DIDN'T YOU SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU VALUE MOST? - NO. - WELL, WHAT IS? - SHE IS. - WHO? - HER! - OH... [crying] - WHAT DID I DO? - IT'S ALL RIGHT, PA. IS THAT WHAT MOST FOLKS TELL YOU? - MOST FOLKS SAY THEY WON'T BUDGE NO MATTER WHAT, BUT MY GRANNY, SHE WANTS A TRAILER WITH A TV. - OH, TV. - WHEN DID YOU EVER LOOK AT TV, PA? - OH, I SEEN IT. I DON'T LIKE IT, IT-- THE BIGGEST PIECE OF SIN FURNITURE MAN EVER MADE. - FINE, I... JUST NEEDED ANOTHER BALL OF WOOL. - TIME FOR MY PILL. - OH, I'LL GET IT. - YOU SIT! I CAN DO IT. - I GUESS THERE AIN'T NO PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE THERE AIN'T SOME VIOLENCE. - WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SOMEBODY GOT HURT, MRS. NA-- AUNT ANNIE? - YOU JUST DID THE BEST YOU COULD. I WAS RAISED ON THAT. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS ASK. HE CAN HEAL...EVERYTHING. - WELL...DIDN'T YOU EVER GO TO A DOCTOR? SUPPOSE YOU BROKE A LEG OR GOT A TOOTHACHE? - WELL, IF YOU GOT YOUR LEG BROKE BACK IN THE OLD DAYS, THEY'D PLACE IT BACK THE BEST THEY COULD WITH SPLIT-WOOD PIECES, AND THEN THEY'D TAKE THEM AND JUST TIE IT WITH GOOD, STOUT STRING. - AND THEN THERE YOU'D SET FOR ABOUT, OH, 12 MONTHS. - 12 MONTHS? - AND IF YOU HAD TO HAVE A TOOTH PULLED... YOU'D COME TO A FELLER BY THE NAME OF J... UH--UH... - GARRETT. - GARRETT. - AND HE'D SAY, "LAY DOWN ON THE FLOOR, BOY." AND YOU-- YOU'D STRETCH OUT. HE'D PUT ONE KNEE ON YOUR CHEST AND CATCH YOU AROUND YOUR HEAD. OOH, HE WAS STOUT, TOO. AND HE'D PUT ONE OF THOSE HOMEMADE PULLERS IN THERE, AND HE'D GIVE HER A YANK. AND HE'D BRING THAT TOOTH! IF HE DIDN'T BUST IT. [laughs] - BUT YOU WOULDN'T GO TO MR. GARRETT NOW, WOULD YOU? - NOW, YOU'D JUST LOVE TO HEAR ME SAY, "YES, I WOULD," WOULDN'T YOU? THAT ALL THE OLD WAYS WAS BETTER THAN WHAT WE GOT NOW. BUT SOME OF THE WAYS IS BETTER. YEAH. YOU HAD TIME. NOWADAYS, IF YOU CAN'T GET TO ATLANTA AND BACK IN ONE DAY, OOH, YOU'RE WAY BEHIND. [chuckles] YOU HAD NEIGHBORS THEN. REAL NEIGHBORS. YOU HAD THE LAND. AND YOU HAD YOUR FAMILY. - I'LL RECKON THAT'LL DO US TILL THEY SOUND THE BELL. - YEAH. - THE BELL? - ST. JOHN'S. THOUGH THEY DON'T DO IT NO MORE UNLESS YOU ASK SPECIAL. - THEY'D GO RING THE BELL AS SOON AS THEY COULD. TOLL IT. YOU'D GET TO COUNTIN' IF YOU HEARD THE BELL TOLL, AND YOU'D FIGURE OUT WHO IT COULD BE. - IF IT WAS A CHILD TWO YEARS OLD, IT'D BE TWO. OR 10 OR 20 OR WHATEVER. - THAT'S RIGHT. - FOR THE OLD ONES, IT'D TOLL FOR HALF AN HOUR. IT WAS SLOW, YOU SEE. DONG... DONG... - SOUNDS SAD. - NOTHING SAD ABOUT IT. SAINT PAUL SAID, "BE NOT SORRY FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEPARTED." - FOLKS WOULD COME AND HELP YOU OUT TO PAY THEIR RESPECT. - HELP YOU DIG THE GRAVE AND MAKE THE COFFIN. YOU'D HAVE A DRINK AND THEN TALK. YOU'D...SING A LITTLE. - I LIKE THE SONGS THAT WAS HOPEFUL. THERE WAS ONE DILLARD USED TO SING. I CAN HEAR IT IN MY HEAD, BUT I AIN'T CLEAR ON THE WORDS. AND MY VOICE AIN'T MUCH, NEITHER.
