International Film Festival in San Sebastian September 1992 Special Jury Prize for Krystyna Janda Best Actress Today, in Wroclaw, was the beginning of the inquiry... into the abuse of power between 1980 and 1989... by the Senate Committee. Jan Wysocki represents the leadership of the Lower Silesia Solidarity movement. It doesn't matter that your archives are empty. We remember what they contained. The files might be gone, but the people remain. And I assure you I'll recognize the face of the officer who beat me. I haven't forgotten. This is the problem. It's because of these few details which are "difficult to expose"... that several of your workers will go to court. And they will be sentenced. I will fight for it. Tomorrow, the Committee will continue the case behind closed doors. All my life, I've been a fool... and didn't understand anything... but now, suddenly, everything depends on me. Everything is different now! Do as you wish, but let me warn you... If you wait too long, it'll be too late! Too late to talk about the old life or the new one! Yes, that one is good. Could you prepare it for me? How much do you need? 10? Twenty thousand. Thanks a lot. I'll give it back after New Year's. Excuse me. Good morning. The lady over there told me you're an electrician. That's right. I have a favor to ask. I think my washing machine blew the fuses in my apartment, and tomorrow is Christmas Eve. I live around the corner. It'll only take a second, and it would help me so much. Well, you see... Please, help me. Here we are. It's still higher up. Fortunately, we're getting a new apartment soon. You have beautiful eyes. Women must envy you. Please, come in. LAUNDRY DISMISSED FROM LIFE Screenplay Music Production Manager Directed by In memory of Leslaw Bajer Did you give him anesthesia? I couldn't. His liver is too weak. Can you smell how drunk he is? His blood alcohol level is almost 0.3â€°. Who is he? He's unidentified. First they drink and fight... and then we have to save them. Trephine. Turn it on, please. What are you doing here? My son, Marek Wysocki, 28 years old. He should be here. We've been to 2 hospitals... and the paramedics said that... But you can't stay here. Please leave. Nurse, we only want to see him. Janek! Nurse, please! Hurry up. Doctor! You can't die. You have to live. Take her away. Clear. Massage. Clear. Massage. There's stuff about you, too. But most of it is about the captain. Yes, we're nearly finished. Yes. Before tomorrow? No problem. What did he say? Not to keep our hopes up. Marek, good morning. I'm here. Everything's going to be okay. You'll get better. He doesn't recognize me. He's a vegetable. That's what they call them. He'll be a burden for the rest of his life. It would've been better if he had died. It's his brain, officer. I can tell you how his organism will react to the pneumonia that he's just contracted, and when it'll pass. But I can't tell you when the patient... will be able to give you his statement. I can't keep the guard here forever. I have to know one thing. Will I be able to speak to the victim today... in a week, or never? If anything, in a month... but nobody knows if he'll be able to speak... or if he'll know what he's saying. Has he been unconscious the whole time? Woke up three days ago. Now he's asleep, but he's luckily getting better every day. My aunt wouldn't be able to cope if he died. What happened to him is terrible. I brought him some fruit and homemade cake. I already told Mrs. Wysocka... that he can only be fed intravenously. I understand. That's just for luck. It's a family tradition. You had to warn him, not beat him senseless! But since you did, you should have finished him. I told you 100 times everything has to be perfect! Well? What if he recognizes us? It will take a while before he recovers. He looks terrible. He was dead. We checked. So he has miraculously resurrected? Maybe it's better this way. It gives us room to maneuver. The guy knows that we can get to his brother... So he'll think hard before saying anything about us. What if it's the other way around? Then they'll guard that guy at the hospital day and night... and we're screwed! Who's going to guard him? The police. There's no reason to be upset. He just escaped. You're lying. He was barely alive. He couldn't even walk. I know he was barely alive... but he's not here! I've ordered an internal investigation and called the police. I was told some family member came to visit yesterday. Maybe they helped him. A workman's jacket has also disappeared. What family member? Your niece. I don't have a niece. What are you people talking about? Sir! He'll see you now. Please sign this statement that the conversation is at your request. Why? Well, isn't it true? Come in. Good morning. The years keep passing, and we keep meeting. Have a seat. You see? Even my chairs are the same. But times have changed. Haven't you realized that? Your tricks won't work anymore. I don't understand. What is this about? About my brother. You beat him up and then kidnapped him from the hospital. You will pay for that. And why would we do that? He's never disturbed us. He lived quietly, and worked honestly. Besides, we have the results of the investigation. On December 23rd... Won't you sit down? On December 23rd, 1989, at around 3:15 pm, Marek Wysocki left his workplace and walked off in an unknown direction with a woman carrying a yellow bucket. There were around ten witnesses. Yesterday, we received an anonymous letter... accusing your brother of attempted rape. She was saved by her husband and her brother-in-law. This is a conspiracy. It's all a lie, and a provocation. Mr. Wysocki, this is tedious, not a conspiracy. National spies harassing the nation... No one wants to hear about that anymore. If you still insist, then be my guest. But you'll be sued for slander. Are you trying to intimidate me? Why would I try to intimidate you? Intimidate a winner? You're supposed to be happy and not scared. It turned out the way you wanted it to. Victory. Go ahead and triumph! Or at least smile! Don't think that this is over! How are you, sir? Good, thank you. How is everything, girls? Fine. Go away! Stealing my apples... Go away! Is Kasia here? Who's Kasia? Never mind... Hey, move it! Communism is gone! If you don't work, you don't eat! - See how lazy he is? - Apples! Hello, you ghost. Are these tough times for workers? You have to do these menial jobs? Don't you understand me? Are you Polish? - I don't know. - Playing dumb? Everyone knows the answer to that. I am. It's not enough to speak Polish or to live here. Where do they have oranges around here? I don't know. Do you think I'm a fool? Are you making fun of me? Are you trying to be mean? Who are you? Where are you from? I'm lost. Earlier, they dumped you at the junkyard, didn't they? You weren't born here, were you? I... don't think so. He doesn't think so... You're funny. Madam, I really don't know... what "oranges" are. Aren't you cold here? Neither last name, nor first name? We have to think of something. I can't keep calling you "fool". What if I have to introduce you? We have to come up with something. Go on in. This is my painting. I have to constantly change it, so it looks different when the sun is out or when it's raining. I used to change it every day, but I don't have the patience anymore. This was my father's room. This door stays closed. First of all, you have to take a bath. At least 3 times, or else... you'll bring in bugs. And you have to take these clothes off. This is all I have. And what's in the suitcase? Slippers. You're lucky that you're the right size. What are you waiting for? Hurry up. Did you steal that from the hospital? No, they gave it to me. Bullshit. They don't give anything away in the hospital. I had this operation... and they gave these to me. What kind of operation? There's nothing to look at. Let me see. What was wrong with you? That's the thing, I don't know. There's a stamp here, we could find out... No, we can't! Have you finished your third bath? You'll have to learn some French, since you're staying with me. Sit down. I'm French. You've found a very decent home... my dear friend, Jean-Marie. It's a miracle that we met. I spend my time between Poland and France. What? Come with me. Here you go. No one could imitate this in Poland. Can you smell it? See this? "Paris". I don't wear it, because I don't want to irritate this poor nation. Well? Then you leave the Markets out onto the street. It is still empty... but some people are already going to work. We look at them and smile. They smile back at us... Some don't. The concierges wash the pavement. Boys deliver fresh baguettes, and croissants. The first coffees are brewed... filling the streets with their aroma. Everything is so wonderful. You feel so alive. This is the first time I've slept with a stranger under the same roof. Where are you? What are you doing there? Are you crazy? Get up. What are you doing? They could catch me at any time. Helping me is dangerous. Who's going to catch you? They removed something from me... They would pretend to leave, and then return. Don't be afraid. Many people suffer from that. It's true. You are safe here. You can sleep. Nothing will happen to you, here. Do you believe me? Is everything okay? Yes. Go back to bed. There was a bald guy who worked here. Bald guy? I didn't see him. - Do you have any I.D.? - I'll show you an I.D.! A bald man, wearing a worker's coat. - Bald? - Yes, bald. I don't know anything about him. He didn't even have a name. I can't tell if they did it or not. They could have given us a fucking sign. Help me. No one has the right to hit me. Especially not you. I forbid you to go out without my permission. Stay at home. Why? Why did we get into this? The Company will screw us anyway, and we just dig ourselves in deeper. At least you're not in jail. Not yet! That's precisely why we have to finish that vegetable off. Or else, he'll screw us... and they'll turn him into a hero. A stupid, yellow bucket! Well? Is it okay now? Regarding Marek, they're at a standstill. They've even set up a special commission. They haven't found anything. There is no proof against them. We can't bring up any charges against anyone. We shouldn't go around getting revenge just because we're in power now. Why didn't they target me? Everything would be so simple and clear. Because they didn't want it to be. Do you remember Viktor? He was in their files under the same pseudonym we had him. He passed information directly to Warsaw and focused only on the big information. Boss, there's someone here to see you. They gave you the file? Jacek? And you came to beat me up? To spit in my face? Do you know what's the difference between a snitch like me and an opposition leader like you? They're willing to remind me sooner that I have a family. Will you tell me who your real friends are? I need them under my control a.s.a.p. Those of you who harmed and who were harmed, hold hands. Don't you realize I'm a private citizen and you have no right to ask me this? I can turn this beating into a very big scandal. Your names and photos will be shown on TV. But I don't want to do that. You have me mistaken for someone else. You don't even know my name! Why are you saying all of this? I'm only looking for my brother. You don't have to explain anything... just give him back, and it's all over... as if nothing ever happened. You're crazy! What are you looking for? Revenge? You couldn't even hit him in the face. You should have smashed his face in, and only ask questions once he started puking blood. If you give him back and leave us alone... I'll do anything you want me to. I don't understand. Yes, you do. You understand me very well. I won't testify against you. I'll sign a paper saying that you never overstepped your bounds. That your men, following your orders... even helped us with some problems. Isn't that enough? What else do you want? I'm not asking for anything from you. Thank you, but there's no deal since there are no more buyers. Haven't you noticed? We've closed shop, and are now just tying up loose ends. And then, goodbye People's Police. You'll finally have a police force like in the West. You could go to them. Are you so sure, that there's... nothing I can prove? Nothing, because there is nothing. And I suggest you be careful. One bad thought, and I'll fuck you up so bad your brother won't ever recognize you. Goodbye. - Could you at least tell me... - I've already told you. Goodbye. The people here don't know anything about life. Abroad, it's completely different. In France, for example. In the South, there are only artists. And I'm their inspiration. Would it be a sin if we... well, you know? This is the Police Station. Hello? I'm trying to contact the family of a missing person. Could you help me? Sure. What is his name? He was found on Christmas Eve in a garbage dump. They had to perform some brain surgery on him. Please hold on. What is your phone number, ma'am? This will take a while. I'm calling from a public phone. Then please give us your name and address, and we'll contact you. Or wait in the phone booth... and we'll send someone over, okay? We chose a bad name for you. Jean-Marie won't do. I keep calling you "fool"... and that's not right. That's my French passport. The photo doesn't look at all like you. You fool. This is an old picture. You have to have a last name. I like calling people by their last name. I rummaged, found a lot... and kept it all. This one will be okay. Here. Learn it by heart. Go on. First and last name? Jozef Emil Rawski. Good. Parents' names? Witold and Zofia. Birth place? Legnica. Date of birth? April 14th, 1963. So? I know it all now. But what, fool? Today is your birthday. Oh. What's this? An orange. Happy Birthday. Today, you're starting a new life. You'll slowly become Emil. It's a very nice French name. Stop it! Stop it! It must have looked terrible. Normal. A regular epileptic fit. For you, everything is regular and normal. Who are you anyway? I don't know anything about you. You don't work but you have money! But I won't be supporting you! It's an incurable illness. It could go away by itself or not. The patient should not be left alone. He might choke or bite off his tongue... during an attack. Read it, if you don't believe me! - Why do you have such books? - Some buy vodka. I buy books. What's in that room? It's forbidden to enter there. You won't be able to live on your own. You always have an answer to everything. You always know everything. Well, don't I? Maybe not always, but often. Do you expect me to act like I'm stupid... like I'm some defenseless woman? A sick woman? And then you could take care of me? Yes. Do you recognize this? What? Only has half a brain. Doesn't make any money. Is afraid to cut an apple. Gets a seizure when he sees a knife and he wants to take care of me? Oh, give me a break. That's how it should be... That's how it'll be once I'm cured. You... fool. What if we were married? And I cheated on you? I would ask you to stop. What if I spent all of our money in just one night? I would try to earn some more. You must have been quite something when you were normal. It's a pity I didn't know you then. If not for this, we wouldn't have met... so there's nothing to regret. Maybe you were a student? Or somebody like that? No. No. Do you know what a student is? Don't worry, I'll show you one day. Or even better, I'll introduce you to a female student one day. They're almost as good as French girls. Marek! Marek! Sorry. That foundation picked five people from around the world. I'm one of them. I've got fantastic children. Give me a break. I won't ever be a Nobel winner... or a Harvard professor. It's too late for that. The most I could be is an assistant. What's with you recently? Everything is either too late or useless. Isn't it, though? You know, of course, that they... beat Marek up because of me. And it was no accident, but on purpose. It was done on purpose. I knew you thought that from the very beginning. It's true. But it's not your fault. I know you don't want to talk about him. That you want to forget him. I can see how you're afraid, even of the memories. But the truth is that you have a younger brother who's sick. And he needs your help. What if they've already killed him? What if he's dead? I know he's alive. Mom, we've looked everywhere. So much time has passed. I know. But he'll be back. He'll come home. You know what? If he does, he'll have to kiss your hands everyday for saving him. Once will be enough. 660-40-87. Twelve. Here you go. Thank you. Name, Mikolaj Haremski. DB7 4-88-285. Name, Mariusz Mielczarek. DB7 4-88-284. Identity card. Passport. The form, please. Have you found anything, captain? What? Well... What are you going to do? I'm going to watch the grass grow. Satisfied? I've looked for you everywhere. Have you been hiding from me? Watch out, they can see us together. You could have trouble later. Hi. Come. They won't trouble us downstairs. You'll be back, guaranteed. As soon as the commissions are finished. We'll always need the specialists... but right now, you're exposed. You arrested and interrogated them. They remember you. Because you let them. I don't want to discuss this. Wait! Don't you understand what's going on? You're lucky you're not going to court. I should tell them nothing happened? That you, Felek, Michalski, were innocent? Precisely! Because there's no evidence and no witnesses against us. The commission can kiss our asses! - Nothing is for sure. - It is! Quiet! No, I'm driving. Maybe we should forget about it. It can remain as it is, he's disappeared... and we know nothing. It can't be, don't you understand? As usual, I know nothing and I'm supposed to keep quiet? Elizabeth is right. We should wait for him to make his move and lay low in the meantime. Except that when he comes back... he'll recognize us all. Actually, he'll recognize me, so don't be so afraid. He might not even be alive anymore. He's alive. And we'll see him again. Bye then. Bye. Listen, what if things get really bad? Nothing, we just disappear. They can manage for themselves. We were only following orders, right? Yeah. Bye. They're already running away, with their tails between their legs. They're running away from you. Do you also want to run away? Not yet. A shirt. One piece. One sweater. And some smaller items... A brooch in a little box. A watch. Phone tokens. Money. May I take this bag? Yes, but without the hanger. This was probably a Christmas present for you. Who knows... who he bought it for? Or why he carried so many tokens? Would he have been happy or not? What are you doing? I'm really cold. It's just for a moment. Who are my parents? Emil's parents? Your mother is a teacher. And my father? He died in a car crash. Are you angry? No. I hope you're right. I am. Bye. How do you know that you don't have a wife and a kid? A son... who's waiting for you? You'll find them and go back... asking me to understand. You'll say you're sorry, that you had amnesia... and that you were handicapped. Goodnight. I'll help you anyway. Take care of yourself. You'll be by yourself there. There won't even be anyone to give you tea if you get sick. That's why you have to come. Remember that you have two sons, not just one. And Sidney is a beautiful city. Go now. Go. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Take it, please. The bad influence of willows is worst when they grow near hospitals. They influence the surgeon in such a way that he cuts out everything during an operation, including healthy organs. It also influences everyone's subconscious so that it's impossible for them to prove malpractice. What's the point of proving that anyway... when it's already been done? The most powerful influence happens during brain surgery. When these willows grow near labs, then all the results turn out false. Besides that, the willows' radiation makes people plant willows which work on people in a similar way... yes, in a similar way, just not through radiation, but through special scents, because they grow huge. - Is this everything? - Yes. Sir, we're ready. Get our stuff, I'll go see the cashier. You're being very slow today. Can't you see I'm trying to back up? Open the door. Open the door! Open the door! Stop! What the hell are you doing? Stupid idiot! Madam. You dropped your keys. Thank you. I saw him. He remembers me. Did he do anything to you? No. I told you he'd return. Now I know where to look for him. I forbid you to. I forbid you! Do you want to be scared all your life? Now it's my turn. If you go to him, I'll leave you. For good. That was her. I recognized her. Did this frighten you? Now I'll remember everything. Everything. I'll remember everything. Marek! - Marek! - What? Come home! Just five more minutes! Marek! Come home! Marek? Marek... Wysocki. Marek Wysocki. Address... Born... Born... You'll remember everything. Just take it easy. Step by step. Day by day. Step by step? Day by day? I want to know everything right now! Not in a month, or in a year! Today! Is it too much to ask? - Calm down. - But...! Why aren't you helping me? Don't you care? Try to understand! I said, calm down. Why do I bother? You're crazy. Marek... You have beautiful hair. Many women must envy you. You have beautiful eyes. Women must envy you. Come in. Son of a bitch! The next person on the list is your mother. Drink. Drink... You bastard! Don't forget the keys. Biting me? Attacking people with a cauldron? You want a cauldron? Stop! Which window? The dark one, on the first floor. Mother must already be asleep and my brother must be out. Go now. Tell me everything tomorrow. Go. Why are you knocking so hard? Hello, it's me. Jesus... Marek! I lost my keys. Mother must be out. God... Only your mother believed that you would come back. I should have known when she gave me these keys for you. She died completely alone. When was the funeral? Two weeks ago. Where's Janek? He's not here. He's in Australia. We couldn't even inform him about the funeral, because... he never gave us his address. Your mother said he wrote to her... That he invites her over there... and we tried to find those letters... but we never found them. They must have gotten lost. Why are you shaking like that? - Are you hungry? - No, no. You probably ran out of cigarettes and are too shy to ask. I don't smoke. You don't? I quit. That's very good. I'll bring you breakfast in the morning. Cheer up. Your mother wouldn't want you to be so sad. What are you doing here? I'm with him. I need a smaller piece of wood. Maybe in the kitchen. You can live with this, but not alone. I've told you this already. You'll make it five times... but on the sixth, you might choke. Wait. Next time, you'll crack your head open for good. And I can't take care of you. I've already... told you that. I really can't take care of you now. In a few days, I'm going to France. I'll be there for two or three months. Last time, I was there for four. Besides... people will think you've fallen in love with an old lunatic. Don't look for me. Don't try looking for me. Anyway, you won't be looking for me anymore. He's had an injection. Let him sleep. Let him sleep. This way, please. I'm not sure if we'll ever find out what happened on that night. She hasn't allowed us to even approach the subject. She can sense all of our tricks. French woman... She was always funny and harmless. She used to come here every year for two or three months. She would pull herself together... and then go back home quietly. Her father visited her every day... and listened to her stories for hours. He was glad to see her happy here. Doctor, we need you in room 6. Excuse me. At this time in Paris, you only eat... caviar, drink wine... Champagne... They can't even make rice in Paris! Shut up, you idiot! You can't even distinguish between shampoo and champagne! And it goes like that all night long. And in the morning... Around 5... everyone goes to the markets. You have to eat garlic soup there. Onion soup. Okay then, onion soup. Emil has arrived. Emil is from Poland. How did you get here? I came... by plane, then by subway, and train. Did you really have to come all the way here to France? You'll ruin me. But money is not important. How are you? Okay. After the markets and the soup... you go out into the street. The city is still empty, but... you can already see some people going to work. They look at us and we pass... each other and they smile at us. We smile back at them. But some of us don't. The concierges wash the sidewalks. Boys deliver fresh baguettes... and croissants. The first coffees are brewed... filling the streets with their aroma. Everything is so wonderful. It really makes you feel alive! Retail subs corrected by bruno321 @ KG
