♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Yes, I want you to come up tonight. I want you to get up here as fast as you can, that's all. Is that your mother? Okay, then come up tomorrow, darling. See you tomorrow. Okay, honey. No, I won't. See you tomorrow, okay, darling? All right, sweetheart, I love you. Yes, just come to New York and come to the apartment right away. Are you driving or are you... All you do is take a cab to number 5 East 73rd Street and here we are, flawless drag queens by the ton. All right, dear, see you tomorrow. - Love you, bye-bye, darling. - Jack, I need the phone. What about dinner? What about dinner? My name is Jack. Well, my mother calls me Jack. Everybody that cares about me calls me Jack. That's... that's my name. But I work under the name of Sabrina, and all the queens all call me Sabrina whenever I see them. I go up to this queen and I say, "What's your name?" The queen says, "Monique." And you say, "That's marvelous, darling, but what was your name before?" And the queen will look at you straight in the eye and say, "There was no before." I don't try to compete with them. Look, I'm 24 years old, but in drag I come on like 110, and I do this whole bar mitzvah mother thing. You know, gaudy gowns and pushy, but that's a good relationship with them because they don't fear me as competition. They respect me, and it's commercial. All drag queens want is love, and they try to get that love by being sexy and beautiful. For some of them, baby, they sleep during the day and they do all their work at night. Because they're night people. They're... some of them have not experienced or have ever seen day people, or worked with day people, or seen the outside world. A lot of them know their street corners, and their bars, and their favorite YMCA, and their favorite bathhouse. But they're beautiful. (indistinct chatter) They're, like, in this fantasy bag, you know? But who's not in a fantasy bag? (honking) (indistinct chatter) I can't help but feel a certain responsibility for Richard, although I certainly know I have no responsibility to him. I first met Richard at one of my promotional parties. I just came in in one of my Alcoa Presents gowns and went dancing around. All of a sudden, there's this little kid sitting there, started asking me questions, and he wanted advice on drag and everything. Well, first of all, I'm not interested in getting any new recruits to the drag bag. All I want to do is sell tickets for people to come see them, so I said, "Look, go get yourself some barbells and..." But he wasn't about to take advice from anybody. I really don't think Richard ever needed any advice. He just sort of had it all mapped out in front of him. (murmur of conversation) - Oh! - Hello. Jerry from Washington. Elliot. - Washington is here. - Washington is here. No shit. - Hello, how are you? - Okay, baby, how are you? Where were you calling from this morning? Where were you when you left that phone message, you called me this morning. Where did you call me from, Washington? - No, I was here. - You were here in New York? - Mm-hm. - Oh, my God. We called Washington, we thought you were back there. I called Washington, thought you were back there. No, I don't think the woman ever understood what I was... Okay, now, we've got to check you into the hotel. In Washington, you were Miss Universe, right? Well, in our contest you won't be Miss Universe. You'll be part of the... you'll be Miss Greater Washington. - Okay? - Did you fly all the way in, or did you take a train? Mary Alice Louise, may I please speak to the contestant? - Hi. - Hi. You want to take her coat, Elliot? You'll check in with Joey... (unintelligible) Joey? - Joey? - Yes, dear. This is my assistant. Check-in. - Hi, girls. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine, how are you? - Hi, how are you? - Hi, baby. (indistinct chatter) That's her. Who is this? Let her see it first. No, that's Nicole. I run these contests all over America, from Boston to the Ozarks, and drag queens are all the same. You get them together, it's like a convention. As soon as you get out in the Midwest... And so when I got in the cab, he said... We were talking about the show and he said to me, at fi... he said to me, "You are a woman, aren't you?" And I... because after I told him it was a female impersonation contest, he said, "You are a woman, aren't you?" I says, "No," I said, "I'm one of the contestants in the contest." He goes, "Oh." He said, "Oh, you certainly are pretty." And he said, "On the other hand," which is more, he said, "I thought the other one who just got out of the car was a dyke." (laughter) After recess. Hi. Hi, Jerry, hi, how are you? Joey? This is Jay under New York. This is... this is Joe Venuti. - This is Joe Venuti. - Hi, baby, how are you? Okay, great, we'd like to stay here now. We're gonna check you into a hotel. Canelle is your last name, right? You'll be checked into a hotel. (indistinct chatter) He just got in. I was just gonna call ya. - Richard? - Yes. Would you please get in here and everyone else? Joe is in charge of the entire East Coast contest. What Joey says is it. McNamara? What color hair do you want? Shut up. Don't start. Will everybody please be quiet for a minute? Yes, would everyone please be quiet? Kids, may I have all of your attention, please? If you remove a garment, we must know about it and we'll have a page there to take it away from you. At the front of the stage, right, you want to take off the duster. So, instead of doing the age-old drag trick of taking off the duster and letting it fall, flop on the floor as in, would you believe Cupcake Cassie has been doing that act at the Globe for 40 years? Instead of that, you take the duster off, hold the duster behind you if you want, or hold it out or something if you want, or just take it off and you put your arm out, and it's our responsibility to make sure your page is there, and he will be. That instant there's a page there to take your duster. It looks very much gayer for you and it looks one million times better to the audience. And if you don't do it, the judges will take points off. Number two, if you are difficult or uncooperative in the opinion of all those people in charge of you, which I'm sure none of you will be, but I am telling you this so you'll know about it, you may be dropped from the contest. Or if you stay out on stage longer than the time allotted, and this you'll learn in rehearsal. Yeah, no cruising in front of Town Hall. Yes, and you may not bring numbers to the room unless you share them with national academy. The national academy is me. I promote and run the whole shtick. The point system again: Five points for walk, five points for talk, five for bathing suit, five for gown, five for makeup and hairdo, and ten for beauty. Shh. Okay, we've got these three problems: Number one, finding a hotel with 28 empty rooms. Number two, finding a hotel hip enough to let our guys in there. And, number three, heh, keeping the guys in. (car horn honking) (indistinct chatter) What are you doing, the bed? No, I'm looking for a place to put my wig. - Can I put it in the closet? - Put it over there somewhere. Okay. Okay, where's the bathroom? Oh, somebody left their cologne. Where's the brush? This thing is a mess, don't even ask. Look at this, it's falling apart. I'm gonna have to reset it. - Do you like the color? - Mm-hm, it's very nice, Jimmy. Yeah, great. I love the way you put your tease up in the back. Thanks, dear. Let's look at the gowns. Let's see your coat, let's see your cape. Two bottles of Scotch, please. And ice. Thank you, we'll be down for it. - My gown, I don't know. - You like it? - Beautiful, beautiful! - I made it in one night. I know. - Do you like it? - It's very nice. It's different. The color with the black hair for a change instead of the frosted hair. Oh, my gown is all messed up. I don't know how I'm gonna undo this (unintelligible). (clattering) I'm gonna try it on. See if it fits all right. These are the earrings I want to wear with the bathing suit, look. Aren't these pretty? - I fixed them already. - What was wrong with it? - They were just loose. - Where's the brush? Yeah, I have a brush in here. Jimmy, remember that stuff for the beards. Remember that stuff for the beards. We need that stuff to cover our beards. That stuff she told us to get to cover our beards so they don't come through our makeup. What time is rehearsal tomorrow? Rehearsals are at two, Jerry LeRoy Studios. Are you gonna be able to get this fuzz out, Frank? - Yeah, I will. - Did you put lanolin on it? I have to get back. The thing is, you know, when you're made up, I want to get an idea of your... this beard, if you're not bothered. All right, but that's good.

This is what I'm wearing to the draft, boys. You've already been drafted, haven't you? Of course not, I'm not old enough. Well, you know, this friend of mine went to the draft board. Well, I was just talking to him and I said, "Why haven't you been drafted?" And he said, "Well, I have been," and I said, "Well, did you tell them that you were homosexual?" He said, "No, they told me." Oh, my Lord. They do, they take them to a psychiatrist. I interviewed with him, and he asked me, he says, "Well, why are you homosexual," and then, I told him that, you know, that my mother and my father made me that way. And then he asked me about boys and stuff. Well, I said, "Yeah, I like boys." So, he said, "Next." I got a letter from the draft board stating I come down at 7:00. I got to the draft board. They said... I had long, red hair, so they said, "You really should have been a girl. You're... it's too much." They said, "You can go. We can't use you." I said, "Thank you," and I left. That was it, I went to Atlantic City, went back home, and I wrote a long letter to the president, stating I wanted to go into the Army. I wanted to go not for... Because I was a homosexual because there men there. I wanted to help protect our country. Simple as that. So, I got a letter back and it stated that they understood and that they couldn't have me in the Army as of yet. Maybe one day they'll see things right and I could get in. Well, my brother was drafted and he's gay, too. He's gay. Does it run in the family? Well, he went down, but he didn't pass his physical because of his nose. - Nose? - He can't breathe too properly. But I have a friend and he's gay, his brother is gay, and his sister is gay. I'm proud of what I've got and I certainly don't want it whacked off. Well, having it showing out of... - You'd have been a queen. - I would've been a girl. Two inches more and she'd be a king. (laughing) ♪ ♪ ♪ (applause) ♪ And although people think we may be feminine, I know... I know I probably don't look like a girl, but I may sometimes talk a little high or, you know, a little feminine sometimes. I think you're all woman. (laughing) Well, my, really and truly, would you like to be a real girl if you could have that sex change if you had the money or you could get it done free? Well, I have enough money to go through the sex change and I live only 30 miles from Johns Hopkins, but it's the last thing I would want. I know that I'm a drag queen. I've been a drag queen for a long time, I've been gay for a long time, but I certainly do not want to become a girl, even if I could have a baby. Do you do bo... are you feminine in bed or you do both? Well, my husband is in the service and he's in Japan now, and even if I could have a child, I wouldn't want to have the operation. But there's just one thing about being a sex change. If you're a homosexual in the first place, you want a man, you don't want... You're not interested in girls. So, if you're a drag queen, they... they don't want... Another gay person is not gonna go, just like my lover. He doesn't like me going in drag for the simple reason that he doesn't want a girl, he wants a boy. He wants me to be more of a boy than he wants me to be a girl. But, yet, I want to be a girl, not sexually, but... Although I like to go in drag and all that and I don't go with girls, I don't have anything against girls, but all that... No, I don't, I really do. I think it's ridiculous for some gay boys that want to hurt girls and get jealous of 'em, but that's just ridiculous. I have respect for everybody. But even if I could have a sex change, I wouldn't have it anyhow. - Not if it was given? - No. My goodness gracious, no. They don't know anything about it, do they? What about... your mother knows this. Yeah, but my stepfather doesn't. My mother and daddy both know. Yeah, when did yours find out? Well, about my second husband, I think. When I took him home and he stayed on for the duration for about three years, they finally figured it out. No, my parents are very, very wonderful. They accepted it, my mother more so than my father. But Mother said, "Well, I love you just what you are." I think it's funny because I come from a little, small town, about 500 people, and everybody in that town knew I was gay from the time I was five years old on up. Oh, Lord, you're so damn obvious. Well, it was the truth, and everybody knew it, and everybody... every woman in that town says, "I want my son to grow up like Jerry Corwin." Everybody does, and even the preachers and everybody thinks I'm just okay. I mean, I can go from house to house, knock on door to door and... Well, your personality makes the difference. Come to think of it, knock on door to door, that's kinda silly 'cause I never knocked in my life. I just open up and go on in, holler, "Howdy!" - How many, 500? - About 500 people and 1,440 dogs, coon dogs. Well, you know, my mother, she doesn't really accept it.

I don't know what to do, I'm interested in myself right at this point, and I don't give a fuck about anybody to tell the truth. I'm very much interested in myself. An NBW, a natural beauty wonder. The first contest Richard ever entered, the first contest Richard ever entered, he won. A lot of these kids have worked their way up from, would you believe, last place to second, maybe third. So, they worked for it. Richie never worked for it. Went into a contest, got on stage, was beautiful, the crowd cheered, the kid won. He never really experienced loss or anything happening to him. Goodnight. - Richard. - What? Just relax. You know what I've been through today. Richard, just relax, please. My stomach is about to bust. Richard, please relax. You're acting like a little kid. Well, that's exactly what I am. You're not that little, darling. You've been through worse than this. All right, it's a big night, all you always wanted, but that doesn't mean anything.

I don't know about the eyes, I thought you were talking about your makeup. No, my eyes, they're terrible. I like 'em. - You gotta... - Okay, you gotta... oh, God! (she laughs) Here goes hell. Oh boy, that's no good? Agghh! Then you tape these. Ooh, you've gotta shadow my line in. Don't forget. - Go ahead. - Pull it in some. You got that double tit again.

I've no idea, find a razor from somebody else, I've gotta go. I put it in here at the house. Ugh. (chuckling) Remember, girls, it's the girl with the poise who'll get all the boys. Work that hair. You gorgeous darling. What time is it? Ten. Uh, you want to talk to Joe Venuti or just have him give me the list, or... No, I want Joey, I want Joey. I can't operate without him. Can't you interweave it? Oh, I know how to interweave it, it's very easy, just tease it up and mat it through. But is that always necessary? Well, she wants it, she digs it... It makes the thing look full, fuller. That is all right. You won't really see it that much, 'cause when I brush it through, you don't notice it. It looks good, but I don't like it with bangs. It's not sophisticated enough. I don't think so. Really. I'm sorry. I think it looks better off her face. Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! Richard, you should see what that looks like from the side. - The worst? - The worst. You look like every other doggone drag queen. She thinks I'm kidding her! She looks like everybody else. - Joe, shut up. - Well, then take it off! Wear your hair sprayed back where you look like you got a little class! Where's the wig brace? Joey, Joey has... Wig brace. - Joey's at 11:40. - Wig brace. Where's the wig brace? - It's in here. - Great. Get Joe Venuti, get him over to Town Hall.

Okay, we've gotta continue with the business at hand. Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the name of the second runner-up in the 1967 Nationals, Miss Sonia from Boston.

Ladies and gentlemen, there can only be one queen, one reigning queen. That's unfortunate. Each one of these marvelous contestants was certainly a winner in his own right. But here is the only winner in the 1967 Nationals, that queen which will reign over America... Harlow, ladies and gentlemen, Queen of the 1967 Nationals! (applause, cheers) ♪ ♪ ♪ Congratulations. Love you. ♪ (indistinct remarks) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (indistinct conversations) (indistinct remarks) - Do you think she is... - She is not beautiful, has no qualifications, and she's bodiless. Did you think she deserved it? Darling, she didn't - deserve nothing! - Answer me! You're not speaking from the damned camera, you have a mind! Do you think she deserved it? You know she didn't deserve it. All of 'em, the judges knew it too. I could tell by the smile on their faces, you know she didn't deserve it. And her explanation for why she wanted the money: to put it in the bank, ha-ha-ha! She's not getting any money. Because Sabrina's not going to pay her. They're good friends. It's only publicity, and it's bad publicity, for Harlow and all the rest, 'cause I declare that's one of the uglier people of the world. And next time, she should drop her outfit off at the cleaners before she wears it on stage. She better get the hell back to Philadelphia, because she's one of the worst... In the dressing room. Where's Miss Sabrina at? 'Cause I'll sue the bitch, I will sue... Did you sign the release? No, I didn't sign any release, and if she releases any picture on me, I will sue the fool. She won't make money off of my name, darling. She can make it off of Harlow and all the rest of the fools that will flock to her. But not Crystal, darling. Anybody but her. Fantastique. You can take all the pictures you want of me, but I better not see 'em on the street, because it's over. Get a picture with me and Harlow and we'll see which is more beautiful, darling. - The judges... - The judges didn't have any taste, it was with you that the judges was with, darling. You were in it. It was all week, two weeks... Monique told me not to come, that's why Monique is not here in dress, because she is one of the... Monique, darling! She's a friend of ours! Monique was not here as a friend of yours, she's a friend of mine, darling. Monique, would you tell her why you didn't come? Because she knew it was fixed for Harlow. She said, "Crystal, darling, don't go, because you're not going to get it." And that's why all the true beauties didn't come. It's in bad taste and you're showing your colors, you should have... I am doing it bad, but I've got a... I have a right to show my color, darling. I am beautiful and I know I'm beautiful. Don't talk about she's showing no color. May I say this to you? You're taking it in the wrong way. Taking the wrong way, shit! She looked bad! And no way or what you say can do about it. Look at Harlow's outfit. That is (unintelligible). Don't bother her, don't bother her, it's not Harlow's fault. It's not her fault. I know it's not her fault. Harlow has... she can't help it, 'cause you're beautiful and you're young. You deserve to have the best in life. But you didn't deserve... Miss Thing, I don't say she's not beautiful, but she wasn't looking beautiful tonight. She doesn't equal me... Look at her makeup. It's terrible! - And, and... - Crystal, wait a minute. Did you complain to the judges? No. I wasn't thinking, really. Why don't you show judges and complain to them? But they told me, Sabrina, that you had it fixed for Harlow. Everyone knew about you having it fixed for Harlow for weeks and weeks ahead. Wait a second. Now, we listened to you, I listened to every word you had to say. Now wait a second, hold it. There's a party after here. Every one of the judges is gonna be there. You may feel perfectly free, I'll cart you over myself and you can talk to each one of them. Most of those people, I never saw before in my life! I don't know them. I went down to the Dom one... Wait a second, dear, you listen to me. I went down to the Dom one night, trying to influence Mr. Warhol to come up here as a judge. We sat down there for two hours and couldn't even get an audience with Andy Warhol, he was running around in his Factory making a movie or something. (shouted remarks) Everybody goes out! What'd you say? Everybody go out, that's what I said. Everybody go outside. Everybody go outside. Show was over at quarter to, I just want it out. Yeah, we're going out right now. Everybody out, let's go! (indistinct remarks) Ugh. Wanna get outta here? (traffic noises) (indistinct conversations)
