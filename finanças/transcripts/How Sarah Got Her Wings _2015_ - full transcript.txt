Oh. Father Tim. Sorry to interrupt, but... Sarah, you're here again tonight? Sarah's always helping out during the holidays. Any update from that new couple? -New couple? -The one's relocating from Birmingham. Mom teaches at Reed, stay-at-home dad, two kids. Loves to salsa. Ah, yes, the Jensens. Sarah's also our resident realtor. Guilty. Sarah Fitzpatrick. Dingo Realty. Making dreams come true in the greater Portland area since 2008. Your company ate my baby. Meryl Streep, "Dingo Realty." Oh, right. Yeah, not that "Dingo." Is there another kind? I think the partners just wanted a made-up name like Google, that'd appeal to a younger demographic. Ah, except it's an actual mammal. I don't name 'em, I just sell 'em. I haven't had a chance to talk to them about their living arrangements. Well, I've got this perfect Victorian in Healy Heights, but it's gonna go fast. It'd be perfect for them. Kid friendly, move-in ready. Just let me know, and I can get them in right after New Years. -Will do. -Okay. -Merry Christmas. -God bless. You want a blanket? Hello? Are you okay? Would you like another blanket? Or maybe some coffee? It's cold out tonight. I lost her. Who? Fiona. Fiona, is that your wife? No, it's my... It's my dog. Let me see if I can find her. I'm sure she didn't go far. Would you? Now, you stay warm and don't go anywhere. I don't want to lose you and Fiona. Thank you. Fiona? Fiona? Ugh, really? Fiona? Here, Fiona. Where are you? I've got a treat. Oh. I found you. There you are. Come here, Fiona. Hi. Welcome. Hi, I don't know exactly where, or what... what exactly is happening? Oh, wow. Thank you. Are you kidding? Meow. Isn't he just dreamy? Could I get a name, hon? What? Oh, it's Sarah Fitzpatrick. And your friend? Fiona. Oh, great. Let me just check our reservations. Where am I exactly? Oh, yes, of course, sweetie, you've had quite a journey, haven't you? Welcome to The Lobby. Did you guys just open? 'Cause I know all the hip places in Portland, and this doesn't look familiar at all. You don't remember anything? No. Wait, yes. There were lights... and sound... I picked up Fiona, and... Am I... Dead? Yes. I'm afraid so, sweetie. And your little dog too! I just always wanted to do that. So, this is Heaven? No, no, no. No, this is just the lobby. You know, halfway, limbo. Purgatory. Oh, I hate calling it that. It's just so medieval. Yeah, no, Heaven is straight through those gates. But you know, we can't just let everyone in. They have to be on the list. I can't believe this is happening. Aw, I understand. It can be traumatic. Are you kidding? I've dreamt about this my whole life! I always knew it would be like this. Beautiful, serene, trendy. Wait, I thought St. Peter was a guy. Yeah, he's been gone for at least 100 years. And frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about it. People have such antiquated gender concepts about angels in management positions. You're an angel? I can't believe I'm talking to an angel. A grand arch angel, actually. but you can call me Daphne. Now, let's get you in. Don't wanna miss your reservation. Oh. What? It's okay if I have to hang a bit. You know, this place is incredible. And those snacks... I'm not seeing you on here. Oh, it's Fitzpatrick. -With a "Z." -Hmm. What? What's wrong? I can't let you in, if you're not on the list. What do you mean, "not on the list"? I... I just saved a dog in the freezing cold. Mm. Technically, you didn't exactly save her. Come here, Fiona. Come here, baby. Oh, yeah, that's a good girl. There you go. Well, how come she gets to go in? Well, you know, all dogs go to Heaven. Let me just make a call. There has to be something wrong. I've gone to church since I was three. I started a program for at-risk dancers when I was 11. -Wow. -I... I didn't even kiss a boy until I was 16. Well, 15, but, you know, still. I... I volunteer every Christmas at the homeless shelter, I... I don't smoke, I do occasionally enjoy a nice Pinot, but who doesn't? Sounds like you've done some really great stuff. Just hang on one sec... Besides, I'm ready. My whole family is up here. My parents died in a freak accident when I was 20, so that works out. My friends will be sad, but they'll get over it. I have no boyfriend, no kids. You know, when I think about it, I don't really have any reason to stay on earth. Okay, I am so sorry, but you do have to be on the list. Well, then Heaven made a mistake. Sweetie, Heaven doesn't make mistakes. But here's the good news: it's possible that I can still get you on the reservations list. Loving ya, Daphne. All right, so, what do you have to do to? Well, it's not exactly up to me. I'm not following. Okay, in order to get into Heaven, you're going to have to go back to Earth and figure out what you still need to do to get on the list. But I've done everything right. Yeah, I don't know what else there could possibly be. I'm sorry. Our policy doesn't allow me to help you with that. -But... -But, I am sending you back to somebody who might be able to. Wait, I'm not gonna come back as like a zombie, or something, right? No, no, you're in the spirit world now. Just think of it like, an angel in training, okay? Here, take this. Just use the Heaven app when you're ready to be picked up, and then we can check to see if you made the list. You have an app? Yeah, Steve never stops working. But what if I don't figure out what I'm supposed to do, to get into Heaven? Well, you're gonna have to stay here. And, if you don't get on the list, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to wait in there. Forever. So, I go back to Earth, and how long do I have to save myself from spending eternity on that sad little bench? Management can only give you until Christmas Eve. -But that's in a week. -Eh, 12 days, actually. But, it's a busy time of year now. -Hurry. -But, I... Good luck! Oh, she's gonna need it. You're just a tall drink of holy water, aren't ya? Jordan Ricks? Sarah? -How... How did you... -It's a long story. I went to your funeral. Aw, you did? That's so sweet. What are you doing here? How did you get in? I could have killed you. Too late for that. Look, I'm really sorry. I had no idea they were sending me back to you. They who? Back from where? You might want to sit down. And maybe put some pants on. ...And then Daphne the angel made the lights glow into little music and Heaven stuff and then I thought it was really cool until I realized I'm not on the stupid list. ...I only have till Christmas Eve to figure out what I have to do to get on the list, or I have to sit in this horrible place with these miserable people forever in the dark by myself. And then she said she was going to send me back to someone who could help me get into Heaven, but I thought it would have been, like, Father Tim from the church, but then I ended up here, and you came out with a bat, and, well, that's what happened. Okay. Well, it was really nice to see you again, but I think it's time for you to go back to wherever ghosts go when they're not haunting people. And maybe just talk about this tomorrow. Or, never. You know, I don't think you're hearing me. Ooh. That was cool. Okay, that's it, you've got to go now. I can't go until I figure this out. And, technically, I'm not a ghost, I'm an angel. Well, almost an angel. This is not happening. This is not happening, Jordan. "May cause confusion and disorientation." Yeah, you're just reacting to your new medication. You're okay, Jordan. Everything's fine. I really wish you'd just listen to me and try and not freak out. Okay, I am seriously hallucinating. See, this is exactly why we broke up in the first place. There's always some kind of drama with you. Hey, you know, I'm just going to go to bed, and when I wake up, you'll be be gone. Fine, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Do you mind if I do some cleaning? It kind of helps me relax, and well, not to be rude, but your place could kind of use it. Please just go away! Okay, okay. Sleep tight. Yo, Riggles. It's me, open up. -Dude. -Hey. You were hysterical last night. Those hipster douchebags, they totally had it coming though. Hey, Stu. Remind me never to ask you if the mezcal is organic and request you serve it to me in a mason jar, with an edible flower garnish. Whoa. What, did you have a late night O.C.D. attack, -or something? -Yeah, something like that. Hey, what were we drinking last night after work? -Manhattans. -Remind me to lay off the Manhattans. Dude, what happened to you last night? I've been texting you all morning. I thought those chicks from the bar kidnapped you or something. Tell me you don't still work at that late dive bar? Relax, I was just kidding, man. She's back. What? Her. It's Sarah. Hi, Stuart. Nice to see you again. Okay, yeah, yeah. I read about this. Okay, all right. You're just in shock right now, okay? But that's normal. We just went to the funeral. You can't see her? I'm here for you, buddy. Okay? Come here, give me a hug. I told you, no one else can see me. Okay, okay, all right. Uh... You gotta go. You gotta go, all right? Look, denial is step two in the process. Or is it step three? I can't remember. But the point of it is, is that you really have to come to terms with who you are. -Okay, Jordan? -Bye, Stuart. -I'll call you later. -C-Can I have my coat, please? I need my coat. Jordan, we need to talk. No, we don't. Stop talking to yourself. You're not talking to yourself. Air. That's what I need, fresh air. Yeah. Jordan, wait. Jordan. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. I forgot, you're the only person in this city who doesn't believe in jaywalking. It's illegal. It's one of those weird, charming things I liked about you. You remember that time we were late to our reservation at Ox because... Yeah, because you had to show that place? And I told you not to. And I was just about to cross the street and tell you to meet me there when that bus came around the corner, - And almost... -Killed you. You spent the rest of the night mad at me. I saved your life. What is it with me and buses? What is this, the longest light in Portland? Okay, my bad. Memory lane trip over. We really need to figure out how I'm going to... Stu was right. I've finally done it. Done what? Given myself a nervous breakdown. Jordan, stop. Jordan. You are not having a nervous breakdown. You are perfectly normal. I'm the one fighting for the salvation of my soul, here. I know this is hard to believe, but this is real. I'm real, and I need to help. Heaven sent me back to you for a reason, and I need to figure out why. The sooner I can figure out how to get on that list, the sooner you'll get me out of your life. This is insane. You're an angel. I'm talking to an angel, in the middle of the street. Hey. Jordan, please. Help me. Okay, I'll help you. I just don't know what I'm supposed to do. Thank you. Hey, buddy, go be crazy somewhere else. You're freaking out my customers. -Jordan. -Amanda. You came. I did? I texted you I was getting the tree this morning, but I mean, I didn't expect you to turn up. That's so sweet. You're dating Amanda Simmons? I don't think you said that with enough judgment. Amanda Simmons who runs CTEC software? Why is that so hard to believe? I don't know. You just don't really seem like her type. Hardworking? Entrepreneurial? Good-looking? -Bartender? -Ah, I see. You're just jealous. What? No. That's crazy. Yeah, you can't handle the fact that I'm seeing someone more successful than you are. Were. -Doesn't she have a kid? -Yes And you're totally okay with that? Because I distinctly remember you saying you never wanted to have kids. Okay, what's with the interrogation? I thought you were supposed to be finding out how to get out of my life and get back... upstairs. No, you're right. I'm sorry. It's totally inappropriate. Here. Try this. You still take your coffee like a sorority girl? Ha. Ha. Wow. This is really good. So, what's the plan? You've seen those movies where the angel has to help some lost soul find their way again, right? Well, we just have to figure out how I can help you. So, your plan is to follow the plot of "Angels in the Outfield?" Well, what other reason would I have been sent back to you? All right, fine. Whatever, let's just hurry up with it, okay? Maybe it's a self-esteem issue? Or just take care of that weird chest hair situation? -Chest hairs? -I'm assuming you've let go of the whole actor thing. I was trying something new. Well, obviously you've hit rock bottom, or else I wouldn't be here. No, I haven't. I need to use the little boys room immediately. Oh, my god, oh, my god. Okay, so my life's a little bit messy. But come on, who's isn't? Yes, but, I was sent back to you. You know, why would Daphne send me back to you if you didn't need my help somehow? So, think. You know, what part of your life needs the most fixing? This might be hard for you to believe, but, my life's been good since you left. Come on, there has to be something. A horrible childhood? Dad didn't play catch with you? A great childhood. I just went to a game with my dad. What's one dream you want to come true? Or, something about your life you wish you could change? Besides from getting rid of the ghost of my ex-girlfriend? -Angel. -Whatever. Think. Yo, J-Dog. I got us a meeting with that pub owner down at River Point. But I promised him half a dozen maple bacon donuts and he said he'll give us five minutes. These old boats, they always got a price. - Am I right? -Hello? Real Estate is my jam. Please don't say that. And it's just a stupid dream, I'm not gonna buy anything. Why didn't I think of this before? Jordan, that's it! That's why I've been sent back to you. Let me help make your dream come true. I'm gonna help you get your pub for Christmas. I got a freaking bladder like a 90-year-old. Come on, man. Do I gotta worry about you? Oh, no, man. I'm... I'm just trying some new stretches. Oh. Did I tell you about that new cardio barre class I started taking? I gotta take you, you'd love it. Yeah. You gotta try to balance and keep the chi. Keep the chi. So... you know, it would need some work. God, it really smells like fish down here. That's what I love about it. It's right next to the river. It gives you that working-class feel. I was thinking of calling it, The Dock House. What do you think? I think I should have brought mace. Come on, it's not that bad. There's not a single prostitute in sight. Okay, I think you need to set the bar a little higher. I mean, this is supposed to be your dream place, But it is. My grandfather used to take me here when I was a kid. We'd sit here and watch boats go up the river and get ready to go fishing. What can I say? I guess I'm a sentimental guy. This place has been here forever. It just needs the love and care that it deserves. Well, I guess every neighborhood needs its pioneers. I mean, the Pearl District was all pawn shops and meth labs till the gays moved in. We just need to get your pitch down. -No, don't waste your time. -Huh? Well, you heard what Stu said, The guy doesn't want to sell. And why would he to someone like me? I can't even offer that much money. Hello? Where's your Christmas spirit? The only reason he's meeting with us is because we're bribing him with donuts. He's an old-school dude who's stuck in his ways. It's not gonna work. Okay, that's ridiculous. I mean, this guy should be paying you to take it off his hands. Are you sure there aren't any other bars in any other parts of the city that you like? I don't know. Maybe. But if we're talking about my dream? This is it. Okay, well, we don't have a lot of time. Time... Shoot, Mason! Where're you going? Oh, I promised Amanda that I'd pick up her son at practice today. But we have to figure out how to get this guy to sell. You can perform miracles, right? You better start flapping your angel wings. They don't even have wings. Come on, Steve, no one can do that math. Sorry I'm late. It's okay. Angus Miller only beat me up twice this time. Oh, my God, Mason, all you all right? I'm just kidding. Mostly. Why'd you say that? I don't know. To make you feel guilty. Well, that's just... mean. So, you don't feel guilty that you forgot about me? Yes, I do. No, no, I didn't forget about you, it's just... How was practice? It was fine. Are you coming over tonight? Tonight? To decorate the tree. Or did you forget about that, too? -No. -It's okay. You've probably got a lot of stuff on your plate right now. You have no idea. Well, you seem a little distracted. Yeah. Well, I guess I kind of am. I mean, the bar has been crazy because of the holidays, and on top of all that, I had an old friend show up out of the blue. What old friend? Just someone that I used to know. A girl? No. -Yeah, but it's not the way you think it is. -Then what am I thinking? -That it's something that it's not. -Nope. -What are you thinking? -I'm thinking that it doesn't really matter. You're not my dad, so you can do whatever you want. Mason, It's just... my mom's kind of a Christmas freak, so, if you're gonna break up with her, can you do it after? I'm not gonna break up with her. I'm totally into her. And I wouldn't do it on Christmas. Never. Okay. I'm sorry I can't come over tonight, I've gotta work. But, as soon as I get off work on Christmas Eve, we're gonna hang out, all right? I... I've got church on Christmas Eve. I'm doing a solo. Oh, a guitar solo? No, like, singing. I know, it's really lame but my mom likes it. It's not lame. Girls love a guy who can sing. Guys who can sing "Oh Holy Night?" Well, at least your mom loves it. She's the one who matters most, right? I guess. Hey, how about I come to church? I promise I won't laugh at you. Let's go. -Surprise! -Oh! -Sorry. -You've gotta stop doing that. Nice tree, huh? Yeah. How did you do that? I've been working on my angel skills. So much fun. And look, spiced angel cider. Not bad, right? Not bad at all. Wait, what's going on? We're pre-celebrating. What? It's good to visualize the outcome you want, and not worry about the things you can't control. You are always the optimistic one. You're gonna kill it tomorrow. Sarah, give me one good reason why this guy would sell the bar to someone like me? You always did that. What? Doubted yourself. I'm just not very good on paper. Well, don't worry. I'll be with you tomorrow. You're not gonna do any of that weird ghost stuff, are you? Hello? I don't need any heavenly help. I'm the real estate queen of Portland. To Sarah, the late, great, real estate queen of Portland. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's okay, I just... It's a nice gesture. I just haven't had a moment to process it. What's it like? Being dead? I don't really know, I haven't had a chance to think about it. Well, you can see what other people think. What? Oh, my God, I didn't even think about that. I mean, I thought about it, but... Hey, what's your password? Well, just go to my page. Yeah, you unfriended me, remember? I can't see it. Here. Oh, come on, you're afraid I'm gonna steal your password in the afterlife? There. Okay. Here's one from Anna P. "This is so sad. One minute you're hanging out with your co-workers for drinks, and the next thing you know you're hit by a bus. Total perspective. I'm gonna hug my man tonight. Miss you girl." See, that's not bad, right? I have no idea who it is. Okay. Well, here's some more. "Unbelievably huge loss. escrow will never be the same." Hey, you left a real estate legacy. That's gotta be kind of nice to hear, right? Yeah. I guess. Oh... Oh, here's a good one. "O.M.G. I can't believe she's gone. She has the cutest outfits. "Hey girl! I'm so toasting with those huge margaritas tonight. Miss you totes." Ha. This is fantastic. You don't have to keep reading those. Well, here's another one. "Sarah totally changed my world of you guys. "She took me out of that strange little life... " And wait for it... "Into my sick new condo, y'all. She was the best. Love you... " Jordan, stop! I don't want to hear anymore. You knew a lot of people. Yeah. Well, apparently, all anybody knew about me was my job and my clothes. Sarah, I don't know how to say this without sounding judgmental, but... But, what? Sometimes, you might seem a little self-centered. And surface-y. That doesn't make any sense. I'm always helping people, listening to everyone's problems. You broke up with me on Christmas Eve. Yeah. It was kind of brutal. But it wasn't working between us. We were miserable, I mean, you remember. Right? Yeah, I remember. So, what was I supposed to do, just pretend everything was okay, when it wasn't? Actually, yeah. It was Christmas. The greatest gift you could have given me was pretending one more day. You broke my heart, Sarah. I haven't been doing very well since you left. I'm sure you've seen my medicine cabinet. That's not fair. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry, I just... I know that there's more to you besides charity, and condos, and shoes. But maybe that's the only thing you let people see. I should get to bed. We've got a big day tomorrow, all right? Good-night. I don't like your face. It reminds me of that actor. You know, that movie where those guys go to Las Vegas, get drunk, and lose their friend? "The Hangover." Right. Hated that movie. Well, you're probably the only one. What are you doing? Who doesn't like "The Hangover." Let it go. Stay focused. Sir, I really think that you'll be happy with the changes that I wanna make. I'd like to gut the kitchen and put in a big wood-burning oven. And then I would pull the wallpaper, and leave all the exposed brick. So, you'd like to turn this into a coffee shop? What? No, no. It just needs a little TLC. You don't think I've taken good care of her? No, you've done a great job, it's just, there's some things around here that could be fixed. No, there aren't. Sir, I think we're on the same page here. You'd like to put condos on top of her, right? No, no, I never said that. Ask him about Liza. -What? -Ask him if this is about Liza. Sir, this might sound a little bit crazy, but, could this have anything to do with Liza? She wants him to know she's okay. She wants you to know she's okay. She doesn't blame him. She doesn't blame you. She knows he did the best he could do, but it's time to move on. She knows that you did your best, but you need to move on. It's time. She wants him to know you'll take care of their place. He can trust you. She trusts me to take care of the place. And she thinks you should, too. She's got a '43 Merlot, and a great table waiting for him when he gets there. Liza says she's got a '43 Merlot and a great table waiting for you whenever you're ready. I'm losing her. What just happened? Was I talking out loud? You take good care of her. -Yay! -Oh. -Yeah! -Yeah, buddy. Here we go, baby. Here we go. All right. To The Dock House. To The Dock House. Buddy, this is amazing. Hey, Stu, it's gonna be a lot of work. I hope you're up for it. Bro, I'm totally here for you, except on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I got urbanating down at Powells. They got the hottest chicks there. I just can't believe this is happening. I have never seen you happier. Whoa. Okay, bro, I gotta be honest with you, this whole "seeing-your-dead ex-girlfriend" thing is really starting to freak me out. Stu, I gotta tell you something, but you're not gonna believe it. No, don't. What? I, um... I'm going vegan. Yeah, man, I... I... I'm taking this cleanse to get rid of all the toxins out of my body. And it's totally making me act all strange. Buddy, this is amazing! Come on, why would you think I wouldn't understand? I don't know, man, I just know how much you love pork and whiskey, and I didn't want you to think I've totally changed. No, you'll always be my little riggles, no matter what kind of weird diet you go on. Thanks, bud, that means a lot. All right, I've gotta go do some pub research. Hey, I don't know if going and drinking at another pub counts as "research." It does to me. All right, get your shoulders together. Squeeze in a little bit. All right, get our singing voices ready. Here we go. Is everyone ready? I really don't have time to play this game with you, Sarah. It'll just take a second. But I think you'll really like it. Ta-da. Wow. Wait until you see inside. Merry Christmas. How did you do this? This old thing? Eh, just the standard applicate I did in crafting class. You'd be surprised what you can accomplish when you focus on a dream. -Huh? -I'm not even gonna ask what kind of drugs you took to get this place together this quickly, but, buddy, this is incredible. This is amazing, Sarah. Hey, so, um... I drove by the church the other night, they set up a really nice memorial for Sarah. Maybe you should stop by, and you know... have some closure. Yeah, that sounds nice, Stuey. Maybe I'll do that. Jordy, I know this is gonna sound weird, but I think Sarah dying was actually the best thing -that that could ever happen for you. -Excuse me? Now you can finally give up on the ghost. -You can see her? -Huh? Oh, right. The ghost of her past. Got it. Jordy, I'm not saying I'm happy she's dead, or anything, but, you've been holding onto her for way too long now. In fact, I never really understood what you saw in her in the first place. Hey, just because she's not here doesn't mean you can talk about her like that, Stu. Oh, well, I'm sorry to throw down some hardcore truth on you like this tonight, but, let's be honest. The girl was kind of a mental case. Yeah, yeah, okay. I think you should just go home. She doesn't need to listen to any more of this. Dude, this is exactly what I'm worried about. She can't hear me. She's not here. I mean, you keep letting this girl ruin your life. She didn't ruin my life. She changed it. In fact, she's the best thing that ever happened to me. You just can't see it because... Well, you just can't see it. Jordy, listen to yourself. This chick dumped you like a misfit toy a year ago on Christmas Eve. And you're - You're talking about her like she's right here. You're losing it, man. Yeah, well, maybe I am. But I don't even care. I've never been happier than I was with her. She's the reason we got this pub, not me! No wonder why you can't commit to Amanda. What do you mean? Here we are again on Christmas Eve. Just let Sarah go already. Sarah? I'm sorry about Stu. He's an idiot. He gets overprotective sometimes. Did you really mean all that back there? Every word of it. I changed your life? Yeah. Well, then, I think it's time for me to go. I mean, you can finally get rid of your annoying ex-girlfriend. No, Sarah, I miss every part about you. Your smile, your laugh, your heart. I think I'm in love with you. God knows I shouldn't be, but I can't help it. I didn't tell you when you were alive, but I should have. Jordan, you don't have to... Do we have our differences? Of course. Dead and alive are pretty big differences. Okay, so it's kind of strange, but we can figure it out. Jordan, you're very sweet, but, it's Christmas Eve. They're expecting me back. You have to let me go. Sarah. You know, you look really good in lights. It's your color. You know what I'm saying? -Oh! Welcome back. -I did it. I fixed it. I made his dream come true. Yes, you did. I can't believe it. Did you see how happy he was? So, I guess this means I'm on the list. Oh. What? No, no, no, no. Check it again. I'm so sorry, Sarah, but you're still not on here. But I did everything right. Oh, no. The kiss? It wasn't supposed to happen. I was just trying to help, and then... He fell back in love with you. And now I broke his heart. Twice. It's Christmas Eve, and I'm not on the list. Please don't make me go in there. Okay, let me make a call. Excuse me? - Oh. Uh, Gerald, Gerald Johnson. Yes. Mr. Johnson. Yes, your wife's waiting inside. We have a lovely spot for you by the gates. -Derek will show you to your table. - Thank you. You just sold your bar to my friend. The guy with the face. I sold him the bar, went home, made dinner. I fed the cat, laid down on the couch, I must have had a stroke in my sleep. It must be time for me to go. Buh-bye. And I mean, bye-bye. Yay, good news. Okay, things are a little backed up, so management is giving you an extension. Oh, thank God. Gosh. But this is it, Sarah. You have to find a way. No, I got it. I'm totally gonna help Jordan figure this out. Maybe it's not Jordan who needs fixing. Stuart? But how would I... It would take... Please let me know what it is. Sarah, you've left something undone. You can't get into heaven with unfinished business. Now, go back, and find out what your heart truly wants. Now, go! Wish me luck. One spiced angel cider, please. Wow, you really got the word out fast tonight. Okay, so obviously things didn't go exactly as planned, because, you know, I'm back. Look, we should talk about what happened. I'm confused, and I'm sure you are too. I mean, what was that kiss? It was totally sweet. Well, actually, it was super romantic. Like the end of "Pride and Prejudice" where Mr. Darcy's walking across the moor and he sees Lizzy, and he takes her in his arms, and... Anyway, the bigger issue is, I need to get into Heaven, and I kissed you, and you have a girlfriend, and... Everything is crazy. I never meant for that to happen. Bro-licious. Hello, Stuart. Great timing as usual. You see those hotties in the corner? -Yeah. -Yup. I think they would make an excellent Christmas gift for your best friend, slash co-owner, slash, spiritual mentor. Very funny. Okay, can we please get back to me, 'cause I'm kind of in the middle of something here. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? I'd like us all to raise a glass, to the young proprietor of this swanky saloon, this angelical juke joint, this cantankerous cantina... Ow! Oh, all right. To the young man who decided to follow his heart, and open up the pub of his dreams, not some 12 short months ago. I salute him, on his hollowed, yet very drunken occasion, to The Dock House. To The Dock House. To The Dock House! Happy Anniversary. Thanks. Mm. Wait, Jordan, what's he talking about? I was gone for, like, five minutes. Hello? It's me. Don't waste your time, honey. -Been there, done that. -What? -But how can you... Trust me. He's not the committing type. Amanda? Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Not her. Stu! Is that Amanda Simmons? My bad. Totally forgot to update you on that situation. Dude, your ex-girlfriend's here. Are things gonna get weird? Things are super, super weird. What? Oh, hi. Hi. Okay, I'm just gonna go. Oh, no, no, I'm really glad you came. I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. -Yeah? -Yeah, I never got a chance to explain. I don't want to do this here in front of people. But... But it's just... I don't know. It's just so good to see you. Oh, okay. I really need to go. No, no, no, please. Just give me another chance. I messed up, I realize that, but I've changed. I promise. I think about you all the time, Amanda. You stood me and my son up on Christmas Eve. Oh, no. Oh, yes. And I'm done, Jordan. Done. But you wouldn't have come here if you didn't at least feel something, right? This may come as a shock to you, but the whole world doesn't revolve around Jordan Riggs. I had no idea you owned this place. Probably because you've never told me anything about your life. Well, to be fair, it happened really fast. So, you just happened to walk in here, by yourself? Actually, I'm on a date. which FYI is the only reason I would step foot in this health department nightmare in the first place. You should have seen it before. You know, I could have him beat up and thrown out of here. Because, I'm the owner. I could do that. If he ever shows up, be my guest. 'Cause, yes, Jordan, I've been stood up, again. Clearly, I know how to pick 'em. Okay, so I stood you up on Christmas Eve, for reasons I'd rather not explain. -Seriously -How could you make tha sound worse? But I've been calling because I want you to give me another chance. I can't. It's not just about me, Jordan. No, trust me, Mason will understand. How could you possibly understand what Mason feels? Never mind. O.M.G. I know what I need to do. Do you mind? Yes, I do, because I'm a good guy. I really like you, Amanda, so could you just give me a chance to prove it? Wow. If I were you, I would totally give this a shot. You don't understand. I can't. I just can't. -It's me again. Ooh, so sorry. -Oh! Totally forgot about the whole sneaking up on people thing. Who are you? And what do you want? Yeah, that's not an easy answer. Try me. Okay, well, My name's Sarah, and I was sent from purgatory to help you get back together with your true love, which I'm pretty sure is Jordan, but I only have until Christmas Eve to do it, or else I don't get into Heaven, and I have to sit on this sad little bench for eternity because I'm not on the list. Oh, but I can do really cool angel-y stuff, like make it snow. So, you're an angel. Basically. And you were sent here to help me? Totally. Here to help you. Isn't it amazing? There, there. So you have to help someone? Yep. Specifically, I have to help you. Thank you. And then you get your wings? They don't actually have wings. Oh. I figured it was just a figure of speech. So, is it beautiful? Heaven? I don't know yet. Oh, right. And that's where I come in. I have to say, you're taking this a lot better than he... Than who? Than... I expected. When I was a little girl, I was convinced I could see angels wherever I went. Especially on Christmas Eve. It's a busy time of year up there. My mom and dad, they thought it was cute at first, and then as I got older, they got concerned that I actually believed angels were real. Well, you were right. Apparently so. Thank you. This is amazing. Exactly like I like it. Another one of my skills. Do you not celebrate Christmas? Because it's fine if you don't. I have a lot of Jewish friends, and I'm open to all faiths. I do, it's just, well, my heart hasn't really been in it this year. Well, Christmas decorations are one of my specialties. Wow. And I really am the only one that can see you? Yep. Now all we have to do is figure out how to get you back together with Jordan. -I can't do that, Sarah. -You mean you won't? I really thought he was the one, but he just turned out to be another guy who can't commit. But what if it's destiny? Destiny? What happened to free will? I mean, don't we get a say in who we want to be with? You're right. Doesn't make any sense. All I know is I was sent to you for a reason, and my heart is telling me that your heart is still a little broken. Maybe. I don't know. Anyway, I have this amazing kid, who deserves a real father figure in his life, not some man-boy who refuses to grow up. I have to protect his heart. Okay, well have you ever wondered why Jordan didn't show up that night? Because he's a flake. Because he was off making out with some bimbo he likes more than me. Wow, okay. Maybe, no. Or, you know, maybe he was trying to let go of the past, and trying to find himself, and follow his dreams, so he could be worthy of you. I need someone who's all in. And I'm sorry, but Jordan Riggs just isn't that guy. Ah. Hey, I just got the highest score in Special Ops. No you didn't. Come on, man. Can't you just go with it for once? Cool. This is getting weird. Why? Because you're a grown man hanging out at an arcade with a kid in the middle of the day? Something like that. Don't you think it's time we tell your mom the truth? But she hates you. Would we use the word "hate"? With a passion. So, if you don't ever want to see me again, be my guest, tell her. Mason. Hold on, hold on. I'm on level eight. Mason. Dang it! Hey, what'd I tell you about your language? Okay. You have my undivided attention. I can't do this anymore. Why do adults have to ruin everything? Clearly, this arrangement works for everyone. Mom doesn't want a man in her life, but she wants me to have a consistent adult, role model. and you want mom, but you can't have her, so I'm the next best thing and I get to do fun stuff on someone else's dime. Uh, I need four more quarters, B-T-W. What's the problem? The problem is that I can't keep hanging out with you in arcades and bowling alleys for the rest of my life, I need you to help me out, I want your mom back. How? Well, why don't you tell her that I'm the coolest guy you've ever met, and all those other dudes are clowns? I'll think about it. If you don't tell her by Christmas, I'm gonna tell her. Are you losers done? Oh. Okay, sorry. Whatever. I got hockey anyway. We're out. Who does she think she is, Kevin Flynn? Really? "Tron" references on a 10-year-old? "Tron" is legit. Ow, ow! Stop! Mason. -Hey. -Hi. Are you gonna ask him about the kid in the Santa hat? About what kid? -What? -Nothing. -So, how was practice? -Fine. Coach is thinking about moving me to starting goalie. Aw, goalie? How cute is that? Catch you later, bye. Can we get pizza? No, darling, I've got a Christmas work party tonight, but Carly's gonna come over in an hour. I don't need a babysitter. I'm practically a man. Oh, right, well, until I see a five-o'clock-shadow on that face, you are getting a babysitter. Well, can we at least get someone fun? Well, Carly's fun. Carly makes me do homework. Can we get somebody else? How about, uh, Jordan? Oh, sweetie, Jordan's moved on with his life now, and I think you should too. Why'd you have to break up with him? Mason, I'm not going over this again. He was nice. Not like those other clowns you've dated. Excuse me? I'm just saying, wouldn't it be nice to have him around again? I mean, he likes you, and you used to like him, a lot. Well, trust me, it's better this way. And what way is that? The sad and unhappy way? You haven't laughed or done anything fun with me in a year. We haven't even put up a Christmas tree yet, and it's four days away. Well, it's... it's been a tough year, Mason. So why won't you just talk to Jordan? Because he's selfish, and he just thinks about himself. That's not true. He pays for stuff all the time. What do you mean he pays for stuff? Nothing. Mason, what's going on? I'm sure there's a good explanation. What, you mean, for why my son has been going behind my back, hanging out with my ex-boyfriend for a year? When you think about it, it's actually really sweet. Not now, Carly. Okay, let's just breathe for a sec, -I mean, who does something like this? -Why don't you ask him? Well, Mason's locked himself in his room. Not Mason, ask Jordan. Maybe then you'll find out what's really going on. Or you can sit here and talk to an angel. Maybe you should let the babysitter in. You need to start talking. He told you. This place looks beautiful. Okay, now before you freak out, Yeah, it's too late for that. I'm sorry, I should have told you... What? That you've been hanging out in an arcade, with a kid? He's not just a kid. -He's your kid. -Yeah, that's right. My kid, not yours. I had no intentions of hanging out with Mason when you broke up with me, but he's been calling me, and texting, and e-mailing me. So, he's been stalking you? Yeah. Basically. I agreed to meet him after practice to get him off of my back, and then I saw that jerk Angus picking on him. What... who? The kid who picks on him every single day that he doesn't want to tell you about. The kid with the Santa hat. And I told him that if he ever needed anything, that I would always be there for him, even if you weren't in my life. I don't know why I said that. I guess it's because I was that kid, too. and I could have used someone in my life back then. I know therapy would have been the smarter choice, but I don't always make the smartest choices. I told you there was an explanation. Do you realize how crazy this is? I tried to tell you. You just wouldn't respond to me. and Mason was so scared that you would disapprove, he never told you. So there it is... the truth. I'll never hang out with Mason again, and I understand if you never want to see me again. So that's it, you're just going to abandon Mason again? What? No, I... Good, so you'll carry on doing stuff with him then? This is so "About a Boy" right now. You're not mad at me? I just want what's best for Mason, and right now, he needs an adult male role model in his life. Especially if that kid's treating him like you say he is. He's at a really vulnerable age. Tell me about it. And... And... And? -Thank you. -Thank you, I guess, for helping Mason. You can pick me up tomorrow at 7:00, and don't be late. I'm serious. Yes. - Should we take a look? Yeah. Absolutely not. -This one? -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Much better. -I'd say... Are you kidding me? Oh, thank you. All right, sorry, Philly. Private event tonight. You really don't need to do this. I own the place. I can do whatever I want. Garçon. Two IPA's here, please. Comin' right up. Bro-ceroni Reminder- -I am off Christmas Eve, but Jose's covering for me. Throwing a Festivus party in my aunt's basement. Where did you find him? Oh he showed up in a basket on my doorstep one day. How very Moses of him. It's been such a great night. That doesn't mean it has to be over yet. You might want to ice your back after that epic fall at the rink. Those poor kindergarteners. My God. I didn't realize how awful you are ice skating. Impressive, right? One of the many things that I'm awful at that I can show you more sometime. Oh, I've seen a few. Sorry, I didn't mean that exactly. No, it's okay. You probably deserve an explanation. I'm really sorry. Last Christmas was really weird for me, you know, I was going through a lot. So, why didn't you tell me about it? Because it was about my ex-girlfriend. Uh-oh. We don't need to go there. What about her? Were you with her last Christmas? No. Not really. I still had feelings for her. and, I didn't know why, because she totally broke my heart. Okay, so that settles that. How about we get some romance going in here? Ah, freaking rats in the basement. I'll go check it out. Look, Jordan, if you're telling me you hooked up with your ex while we were still together, and you expect some kind of sympathy, -I'm not that girl. -We didn't hook up. It was... it was just emotional. How about something more Christmas-y? I can make it snow inside. I've got this, thank you. No, you probably don't. I just... I couldn't get her out of my head. Literally. I thought I was going crazy at one point. And then I realized it was resentment and pain that was bottled up inside of me. I just... I was holding myself back. from connecting with people and life. Were you with her on Christmas Eve last year? Yes, but it was that moment that I knew that I had to get over her. I knew that I had an amazing woman back at home waiting for me. And, it was almost midnight by then, but you know what happened next. It's not an excuse. I just want you to know that I am totally over her. And I'm here now, all in. Well, maybe I should thank her, this ex-girlfriend of yours. Sarah? You can't. She unfortunately has passed. Sarah? Yeah. What? Is that a problem? Can you excuse me a minute? Amanda... Amanda, stop. You're the ex-girlfriend. I know, I should have told you sooner. What kind of sick game are you playing? I'm not playing a game. I was sent back to help you, I promise. And why should I believe you? Amanda, I know I should have told you about Jordan, but that doesn't mean that the two of you aren't meant to be together. I don't want to hear it. You're... you're an angel with an agenda. No, I'm not. I mean, yes. I mean... You're not an angel. You're the devil. Go away! You two, you both deserve each other. Amanda, I don't understand what went wrong. I can't do this. I can't be with you, and... and be haunted by some woman from your past. -It's not like that. -It's not like that. Amanda. Amanda. She's gone. She's gone. What's wrong? I'm fine. Is Jordan coming over tonight? Eat your chow mein. I don't want to be late for midnight mass. Okay. It's Christmas, I'm alone, and I've ruined everything. It is Christmas, but you're not alone. I ran out of time, right? I'm not on the list, am I? Okay. Are you ready? Wait, I can't just leave them like this. Jordan's miserable, and Amanda really loves him, she just doesn't trust it. Can I just have a little more time to fix what I've messed up? Please? They don't deserve to be punished just because I can't seem to do anything right. I don't want this to be how I leave this world. I see the way he looks at her, and how she just wants him in her life, and how Mason just wants a dad. Jordan would make a really great dad. They just need a little faith. You told me to figure out what my heart really wants. It wants to help them be a family. Please, can I just give it one more try? I'm really not supposed to do this, but I can't help it. I like you, Sarah. Okay, I can't help you get on the list, but I can give you another hour to help Jordan and Amanda. -Thank you. -But that's it. An hour, okay. I just wish I could talk to Jordan and tell him what he needs to do. Well, I can't make people see you, but there is a way they can hear you. What? How? It's called, The Angel's Whisper. It's a powerful tool. Wow. But don't go crazy, Getting into people's heads and controlling what they say is a delicate art for any spirit being. Wow. Whew! It doesn't hurt, they just think that they've dosed off for a second. Do you think you can handle it? -Thank you. -Mmm-kay. -Call me when you're ready. -Okay. Feats of strength! Feats of strength! Feats of strength! Getting out of here, buddy. Merry Christmas. Come on! I have to go now. Hey, Stu, what's going on? No time for talking, just doing. What? Tonight is about helping those in need. Dude, seriously is everything all right? Yeah. Is that jacket Dolce? I mean, yeah, bro. Everything's fine. Just come on. Wait here. I'll be right back Wait, Stu. What are we doing? Is that wine? Uh, yeah. Are you supposed to have this? Psst. Yes, you. Come here. Stuart, what are you doing here? Thought I'd meet you. Meet? What for? Ahem. What are you doing here? It's Christmas Eve. We're all here for different reasons. Amanda, what happened last night? Not here, Jordan. Well, if you can't speak your heart on Christmas, when can you? Go ahead. Tell him about her. About Sarah. Stuart, what are you talking about? The truth. What have you got to lose? Hey, don't listen to him, he's... I can see Sarah. Sarah talks to you? Like, as if she was real? She said she came to help me fall back in love with you. I know it sounds crazy, but... I knew I wasn't going nuts. Wait, is Sarah here right now? No. Are you in love with me? You don't want to be with me, Jordan. Yes, I do Amanda, with all my heart. What can I say to make you believe that? All this time, I kept thinking that you were the one with the problem, that you were the one in a mess, but it was me. I'm a workaholic, I have huge trust issues. I have no idea what's going on in my son's life, and I talk to angels. So do I. I can hear her too. At least I did. Honestly, I don't even know anymore. But you know what? None of that matters now. Why? Because now I'm here with you, if you'll have me. If you and Mason will give me another shot, I promise I will never let you down. Never. I am all in, so what so you say? Merry Christmas. - Hey! - Hey, bud. You did a great job. It was a little long though. Are you having Christmas at our house? If you want me to. Totally! Aw. We better get going if you want Santa to come. Mom, there's no such thing as Santa. Is there? Kid, these days, I believe in everything. Hey, just hold on one second. -I'll be right back. -Sure. - Good job. - Okay, let's go. That was so good, I'm so proud. Sarah, I just wanted to say thank you for all of this... for them. Jordan, wait. It's me. Sarah? I just needed another minute... here with you. You've been here the whole time, haven't you? And you don't have to worry. I'm not gonna come back again. I think you and Amanda will be really happy together. Thank you. Why are you crying? Because I'm scared. It didn't work, did it? I'm so sorry. But Sarah, you're a good person. I know that. And whatever comes next for you, I know you'll be okay. Bye, Jordan. I love you. Goodbye, Sarah. What just happened? I think you just saw an angel. Can we just get this over with? Sarah? I want to show you something. Oh, is there an ever sadder place for people who don't have any reservation? What? But I ran out of time. It's funny. Love always seems to beat time. I don't understand. You fell in love. Maybe not romantically, but management doesn't really differentiate. When you truly love someone, you act with your heart, not your head. Your name was added to the list because you helped Jordan and Amanda and Mason become a family, even when you knew that you weren't going to get into Heaven. You needed to perform a true act of love to get on the list. Ah. So I got my wings. Well, angels don't really have... what the heck? Yeah, you got your wings! So, whenever you're ready, you just walk through those gates. -What's the matter? -It's just... You don't want to go? I know this is crazy, but... I want what they have, I want to feel what they feel. I want to feel pain, and passion, and love, and I want my heart broken, and mended. What if I want to start a family of my own? If I walk through those gates, it's over. I mean, I'm sure the food and drinks are amazing, but... none of this makes any sense. Why did I have to die? Sometimes it takes dying to realize you want to live. I don't want to die. I'm sure your reservations have a no cancellation policy, I'm sure I can't just send myself back. No. But I can. Are you okay? Oh my God, you almost got yourself killed. Yeah. I guess I did. You sure you're okay? Yeah. I think so. -How did you know I was -I found it in the door, and then I saw you, just standing here. That's one lucky scarf. God, I'm Hank, by the way. Hey. You sure you're okay? I'm better than okay. I'm alive. -May I... Yeah. Hey. Let's get you inside. Yeah. Do you believe in Christmas miracles?
