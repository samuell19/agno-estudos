- Here. (Snakey chuckling) - Can we pet him? - No. No, he might bite you. I just caught him a couple hours ago. You can touch him, but that's all. - You're doing more than just touching him. - That's different. He knows that I'm part snake myself. There. Now you touch him, but gentle like. Don't you hurt him now. - Gosh, he's big. - [Snakey] You gonna try and get me some mice next time? - Don't you worry, Snakey. - You don't get me some mice, you know, my snakes is gonna be suffering from a mouse famine. Ronnie, get out of there! - You got a snake in that car. Can't we see him too? - No, you can't! - Why? - I'll bet I let you touch 100 snakes since we been doing business together. Ain't that so? - Yes sir, at least. - Maybe more. And you ain't never got bit? And you ain't never been scared very bad since you first worked up nerve enough to touch your first rattler. Have you? - No, no sir. - Nobody ever gets hurt if he uses his head and listens. And minds his own business. - I bet it's a coral snake. - It's a cobra. I can tell by the way that the sack moves. - Now look here. I don't want no guessing. - I don't see why we just can't look at him. - I'll tell you why. It's because he's a very special kind of snake. And he ain't got nothing in common with little boys. As a matter of fact, he don't even like little boys. - It's Brother Joy! - All right, you boys better scatter. You don't want him on your backs, too. Now go on. Get out of here. I'll see you next Wednesday. Scat! (auctioneer chanting over loudspeaker) - I see you're still involving children in your elicit trafficking of God's little creatures. - Well if them mice and lizards is God's little creatures what the hell do you call my snakes? - All serpents do the work of the devil. - Hmm. Well mine happen to work for the University of Chicago! And they gotta eat! - Perhaps they do. But do you have to compound your sin? Must you tempt the children of our community with your blood money? - Oh, horse feathers! Their daddies are over there in that auction barn right now selling God's big creatures! Are they taking blood money? - That's an interesting comparison. But misleading. I wonder how many others might be confused on that point. Could make an illuminating topic for my sermon next Sunday. Perhaps if the parents understood the moral ramifications of your unholy Wednesday dealings, then... - Now you listen to me, you sanctimonious son of a bitch. (drum rolling) If you want to hang onto your Sundays, you better pray to God that nothing happens to my Wednesdays! - Brother Palmer. Brother Holden, how good to see you. As you recall, you asked me to look you up on Wednesday, and here I am. - Darned if you ain't, Brother Joy. And it's the right day, too. I can guarantee you, it ain't Tuesday, and it ain't Thursday, 'cause Snakey Bender is here, and Snakey Bender is Mr. Wednesday himself. Did you know that? - Yes, I am very much aware of when Mr. Bender comes to town. - Hey, Snakey! (both laughing) - Hiya, Burt. - How you doing? - Holden, I'll be going if it's all right with you. - Oh, it's all right with me, Bud. Look, you be sure and get that water pump at my house fixed tomorrow. - Don't you worry none. It'll be running just swell by the time you get back with your bride. (Burt exhaling) - Well. Now you know. Burt Holden's off to the city tomorrow, and he's bringing back a wife. Guess there's no real reason to keep that a secret. - Well, congratulations are certainly in order! Nothing in this universe of ours is more beautiful than heaven's own sublime state of matrimony. - Oh by God, it's getting deeper out here than it is in the auction barn! - Who is she? A local girl? - Oh no, she's more of a central city. Her name's Ivy. To tell the truth, Brother Joy, Ivy's kind of funny about religious things. We're just gonna do it over there in the courthouse. And then later, as she gets to know you, I will put her to getting in the church. - Bless your heart. - Hey! Snakey! Hey, listen, Snakey! Listen! - I'm listening. - Have you been to the post office yet? - Nope. - Well, there might be a new album. Going? - Always have and always will. - See you at the house at eight, right? - Right. - Don't you be late now. - I never have been, and I never will be. (car engine starting) - That snake man and his brood are becoming a problem. - Yeah. I think he's pretty mad at me right now. - You provide him with a home on your ranch, free of charge, I hear. - Oh, he's lived on our old homestead place for years, ever since it burned and I decided to move to town. - I also hear he has your ranch literally crawling with serpents. Don't do much for real estate values, does it? (Burt laughing) And it is unnatural, Brother Holden. Unnatural. - Not for Snakey, it ain't. He's perfectly content, believe me. As long as him and the snakes have plenty to eat. (laughing) - That's just the point, Brother Holden. He's using the children of this community to help him round up helpless little animals to throw to that pack of vipers! Placing them children in extreme moral and physical danger! You have to make him stop it! - Whoa now, whoa Brother Joy. I don't know if anybody can make Snakey Bender do anything. - At least talk to him, I, I'd appreciate it. Now. About our own business of the building fund for the new church. - Oh yes. - Deacon Barker tells me that you intend to fulfill your entire $1500 pledge today. - Yeah, got my check right here. - Brother Holden, I've been thinking. Why don't you just hold onto that check until tonight? If yours is the first donation at the building fund rally, that should set a marvelous example for the rest of the congregation to follow. - I'm sorry, but this is Wednesday. I'm always busy on Wednesday nights. - Then I just have to tell them that yours is the first donation. It'll still be a marvelous example. (lively banjo music playing) - Snakey Bender, if I catch you driving on the wrong side of the street one more time, I'm gonna give you a ticket. I don't care if you do come to town only one day a week. - Okay, Al. - Is that all you got to say about it, okay Al? - What the hell do you want me to say? I weren't breaking the law on purpose. That's the way I been aiming at the post office for a long time. - Hot damn. Here comes little old miss peaches and cream. - Now, Sis. You leave her alone. She's mine. - She's been yours since last September and all it got you was a pain in the pants. From now on, she's ours. - My goodness, Miss Williams, you sure are carrying a big load there for such a little lady. - Just put it here by the cash register. That's right. Just leave them there until you get all through with your shopping. - Thank you. - My, I just don't know how you do it, staying so fresh and pretty after a full day with all them yelling youngins. - Oh, it's not all that bad. Besides, I'm used to the children. Thank you. Oh. What? Oh, oh! - You have to spank any of them today? - Oh, Mr. Palmer, we teachers don't spank much anymore. Things have changed since you were in school. - Boy, you can say that again. - I can remember my teacher really blistering some of them boys. - Oh? - Yeah, I got a couple of belts myself. Once, she almost broke her hand when she tried to hit my... - Oh! Oh! - Oh! - Oh, oh! I am so sorry. - Okay, it's okay. Would you like a sody pop? - Oh, yes. I mean, that would be wonderful. If it's not too much trouble. - Oh, it's no trouble. And you call me Bud. - Yeah, get one for all of us. Oh, say, how about some cookies? - Oh, I don't know if I should take time for both, Ms. Palmer. - Sis. - Sis. - [Sis] Cynthia? - [Cynthia] Why yes, how did you know? - Oh, I got ways and means. - Oh. - Tell me, how do you spell that? S-I-N? - No, no. C-Y-N. (both laughing) S-I-N. Oh, that's very clever. I never thought of that before. Sin. - Maybe you ought to think about it more often. Oh say, why don't we go right next door to our house where we can relax and enjoy this? - Oh, do you live right next door? - Yeah, and we got bedrooms and everything. - Oh, well I don't think I should... - Oh now listen, Cynthia. We can't leave the store closed but a minute, and we can't drink these here. It's against the law, or something. We can go right out the back door. - Well, just for one moment. - Now you let me just take these off your little hands. Here we go. - Hey, Sis. Where in thunder you hiding the pork and beans? - Oh! Mr. Bender, I'm so glad to see you. I want to show you something. - You stupid! - I locked it, honest Sis, I locked it! - The children were simply thrilled with your visit last week, and the snakes you showed them, well, they haven't stopped talking about them all week. Here, Mr. Bender. This is for you. They asked me to make you read it out loud. - Let me go pitch his head off. - No, she's too much a lady to hang around now. - Dear Mr. Snakey Bender. We thank you very much for coming to our school and telling us all about snakes. - Oh, she'll be back. - We learned a lot, and we hope you will come back soon. We wanna know more about your snakes. Yours truly, the fourth grade class. - They wrote it all by themselves. I didn't correct one word. - Well, you tell them I really appreciate it. - [Cynthia] I will. - Come on, the least we can do is act friendly. - They told me to tell you they hope, we all hope, you'll come back real soon. I almost forgot my root beer. I really don't think I'll have time to finish it all, though. - You come back again, Cynthia, whenever you get the time. - Thank you, Sis. I really do have to get home. Grade school teachers never have a minute's rest. - Well I'll be dogged. They have all kinds of pork and beans. How come you moved 'em? Thank you, Bud. I reckon I'll take a few extra cans this week. Uh-uh. Put 'em on my tab, Bud. - Uh-uh. No more credit. You already owe us for two months' groceries as it is. And you owe Sis five bucks for putting two shipments of snakes on the express truck. - I ought to let Bud pop your head off like he does them slithering, slimy snake friends of yours. Except you ain't got enough tail to get a hold of. (Sis laughing) - I'll pay you next Wednesday. - Don't give him no more credit, Sis. - Sack the groceries. Take a couple of taffies. They're on the house. - No thank you. - Oh, go on. They're free. I give them to all my customers. Get out there, get out there, get out there. (lively banjo music playing) (Snakey spitting) (panting) - Well, what's the matter, Snakey? Don't you like my taffy? (drum rolling) (both laughing) (car engine starts) (tires squealing) (crickets chirping) (soft country music playing) ♪ If you had the time ♪ And always burden my dreams ♪ I need them done ♪ I need you my dear ♪ I know that (loud choral music playing) ♪ Lord you been preaching so long ♪ ♪ That a print on your arm ♪ Is priceless ♪ If one could be found (choral music blaring) ♪ Well you can go - Hey Al. Can you kick it up a little bit? ♪ This illusion's still strong ♪ In your mind (loud exciting band music blaring) ♪ My dear (band music grows louder) Hey Al. - Left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right! Left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right! (whooping loudly) (both laughing) - Man! - That "Stars and Stripes Forever" is just plum inspirational! Makes a man wanna grab a gun and start marching! - Yeah! (both laughing) Well, if you think that's good, you shoulda heard John Philip Sousa himself. - Yeah, you told me you heard him once! - Yeah. - But go on, tell it again! (both laughing) - Well. It was back in 1928, in a real big auditorium back east. And that place was packed with people. Well, Sousa and his boys was playing all the very best marches, like "The Thunderer", and "El Capitan", and "Semper Fidelis", and "The Daughters of Texas"! (both whooping) Well, it wasn't till the very last of that program that he played "The Stars and Stripes Forever", which, of course, is his very best composition. The first time through, they played it in a normal manner, but the second time, wowee! While the drums was booming, the flutes and the piccolos and the coronets and the trumpets, they all marched right down to the front of the stage, and they line up, military like, and man! That whole band, they all cut loose! (Burt laughing) Well! (whooping) That audience say, including me, they got to their foot, just like Sousa was playing "The Star Spangled Banner" instead of "The Stars and Stripes Forever", and when that number was ended, the audience and me, we was on our feet, and you never heard such clapping and cheering and stomping! I thought that noise was gonna bring the roof down on our heads. But I didn't care none. I was making just as much noise as everybody else! - Oh, I sure wish I coulda been there to see that! (laughing) - This record's got one whole side of Sousa's marches. "Corcoran Cadets", "Hands Across the Sea", "Thunderer", and "Semper Fidelis". - Look, Snakey. I gotta be hitting the sack if I'm gonna get up early in the morning. - You mean you're gonna marry that little dancing girl? - That's what I said, wasn't it? - Burt. Have you gone and forgotten what happened to you last time you got mixed up with a woman? You're still paying a whopping big sum of money every month for that mistake. - Well, that won't happen with Ivy. Now believe me, this girl is a real little honey. And boy howdy, has she got a build. Just wait till you meet her. She's got talent, too. Why, I can sit and watch her dance all night long. She makes 200 a week in that club. - Well, then I reckon we aren't gonna have no concert here next Wednesday night. - Why? You gonna get sick or something? Somebody gonna steal my stereo? (laughing) - Well shucks, you with a new wife and all. I figures... - Oh, Snakey, you ain't nothing but an old worrywart. Now look, how many times we missed our band concerts in the past few years? - Not once. But... - But what? I'll tell you but what. You just be here next Wednesday night at eight, Mister. You hear? (soft country music playing) (crickets chirping) ♪ It wouldn't mean a thing ♪ If they didn't come from you ♪ All the things you do to me ♪ Are the ones that thank god most ♪ ♪ It's the little things that matter ♪ ♪ The little things that make me gladder ♪ ♪ That when I'm alive ♪ Living and loving you ♪ It's all the little things I love ♪ ♪ That makes me love you (knocking at door) - What are you doing here this early? I told you never to come here this early. - Well, it couldn't be helped. Burt and me didn't have much of a concert tonight. - Well you could have waited a while longer. - Well, let's go on in. Lucifer is getting a bit anxious. (soft tense music) - [Cynthia] Snakey, please give him to me. Oh. Oh. (Cynthia moaning) (Cynthia moaning loudly) (Cynthia panting) (Cynthia moaning loudly) - See you next Wednesday, Miss Williams. (crickets chirping) (pounding at door) - Hiya, Cynthia. - Howdy, Cynthia. - Bet you're surprised to see us. - Why yes, I am a little. - Well, Bud and me thought it was high time we paid you a little visit, so here we are. - That was very nice of you, but isn't it sort of late, I mean? - We was here earlier, but we didn't want to bust in on your other company. - Other company? Oh my goodness. - Now Bud, you shouldn't have said that. You're frightening our little bird. Now don't you worry none, Cynthia. Bud and me know how to keep a secret. - Darn right, we do. - But you're taking a chance. If them prudes on the school board find out that you're carrying on with the likes of Snakey Bender, they could cause you some trouble. - Oh, but it isn't what you think, I mean... - Shh. You don't have to explain anything to us, Cynthia. (dark tense music) At least not now, anyways. - [Bud] No. After you, Cynthia. (auctioneer chanting over loudspeaker) (cattle bleating) - The boys show up yet? - They'll be here. Don't you worry none. They'll be here. - I don't think so, Brother Bender. I don't think so. You see, they have no real reason to see you now, since they released their little animals. In fact, they will probably experience a temporary sense of betrayal, and would therefore suffer shame in your presence. Ah, but isn't that infinitely better than suffering shame in the presence of God? - I told you to leave my Wednesdays alone. Now what'd you tell them boys? - Nothing. I simply stood by and witnessed with approval as Miss Williams enlightened them. - That's a lie. She loves snakes as much as I do. - Maybe more? Nevertheless, she found it in her heart, and her own best interest, to do God's bidding. The truth is that she spoke to the children. I said not word one to 'em. - You did his dirty work for him? - No, I didn't! I mean, I didn't want to. He told me he was gonna go to the school board. - Oh. Okay. Okay. I gotta figure out some way to feed my snakes. They've gotta have live food. Don't you be surprised none if I'm late tonight. - Snakey? Don't come to my house tonight. There won't be any more Wednesday nights. - What the hell's wrong with you? What about you and me and my snakes? - I want Lucifer. I'll buy him from you. I'll pay you whatever you ask. - What about you, and me? - You thought that, how could you possibly think there was something between us? I mean, something really? Snakey, I can't believe that you would think there was something between us. - By god! You women are all liars! (dramatic band music) You're all willing to buy or sell love just as soon as somebody drops his pants, and when the going gets rough, you're onto the bushes, and leave the man behind, looking like a damn fool! There ain't one of you can be trusted! That's why no man ever ought to get himself married. Not me, not Burt, nobody! And Lucifer ain't for sale. (door slams) - I swear, you're the sneakiest man I've ever seen. One of these days I'm gonna swat you for popping up out of nowhere. - I want to pay up my bill in full. - Well. Ain't you gonna stock up on some groceries before you pay up? - [Snakey] I ain't trading here no more. - Well, now what do you think about that, Bud? - I say good riddance. - Well now that just shows you how different a brother and sister can be. Now as for me, I appreciate your business. Why, I wouldn't dream of letting you shop anywhere else for your groceries. - [Snakey] How you gonna stop me? - Easy, that's how. Bud and I know all about you and that little schoolteacher. And I mean all. I can guarantee you, she'll back our story to the hilt. She's on our side now. Not yours. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh, don't be coy, Snakey. - You're crazy if you think you can force me to trade here, Sis Palmer. - That's exactly what I wanna do. You got yourself in a corner, Mr. Snake Man. And I ain't about to let you get out. - Hey Snakey, there's a friend of yours crawling out of your car, there. Oh no you don't. Hey Sis, come here! - (laughing) Got him! You go do that one thing you're good at, boy. (snake thudding) (dark tense music) - He's all yours now, Snakey. (emotional music) - See you next Wednesday, hear? (Bud chuckling) Good boy. (drum rolling) (crickets chirping) (soft tense music) (knocking at door) (knocking at door) - I'm Jim Bender. I'm a friend of Burt's. - Oh. Um, Burt's taking his bath right now. I'm Mrs. Holden. But if you're a friend of Burt's, I guess you ought to call me Ivy. Burt, Jim Bender here to see you. - Snakey. - Excuse me? - Snakey. Folks round here call me Snakey. - Oh, yes. Of course. I remember now. You catch snakes for a living, and you and Burt listen to band music together. - Yes, ma'am. We have a band concert every Wednesday night. - And tonight is Wednesday night. - Yeah. - Burt! Where are you? You got company. Well now looky here, Mr. Bender. I think we're gonna have a problem. - You see these speakers on the wall? They make you feel like you're right in the middle of the band! - Yeah, I'll bet. (Snakey laughing) - Oh, Burt and me has had some high old times right here in this room. - Like I said, Snakey. I think we're gonna have a problem. Married life isn't like single life, you know? Burt's gonna have to make some changes. - Did Burt say that? - No, but I'm sure he'll see it my way. - Why are you interfering with our Wednesday nights? Ain't none of your affair. - This is my house now as much as Burt's. You have no right... - I do have a right! (drum rolling) Wednesday night is my night. And Burt's. Now you listen to me, you're nothing but an outsider, a newcomer. You be careful when you start talking about changes. - Burt? Burt! Where are you? Get on in here. - Hey, Snakey! Hey, good to see you! (Snakey laughing) - Howdy, Burt. - Well, how do you like her? She's a little old honey, isn't she? Ivy, this is Snakey Bender. The fellow I was telling you all about. - Oh you silly, he introduced himself. How do you think I was able to tell you who was calling, huh? (Burt laughing) - Well, we're gonna have a lively concert in here tonight. - What's that? - Well, it's Wednesday night, Burt. - Well, I know it's Wednesday night, but look Snakey, we've been married for less than a week, and well, we kinda already had something planned for tonight. (laughing) - Burt, we ain't missed a concert in years. - Well, it won't hurt us to miss this once, will it? Probably do us good. And besides, look, we're leaving tomorrow for Mexico. Going down there for a little honeymoon. - How long you gonna be gone? - I don't know, about two, maybe three weeks. - And you won't be here next Wednesday night? And maybe not even the next? And maybe not even three weeks from now? - Now look, Snakey. You quit acting like a little child. Now that band concert just ain't all that godawful important. (door slams) (funky upbeat music) - Snakey? Ho, Snake! (knocking at door) Morning, Snakey. - Howdy, Burt. - Bud went over to Central City to pick up some stuff, so I come out here to do the feeding. - I thought you was leaving today for Mexico. - Look, Snakey. The real reason I come out here was to see you. - Oh, you don't have to apologize to me, Burt. You just got married. When you come back from Mexico, we can start right back just like nothing ever happened. - You don't understand. I have a wife to think of now... - Yeah, of course you do. And there ain't no reason why the three of us can't attend our concerts instead of two. I've always heard, the bigger the crowd, the better the music. What do you got there? Can I give you a hand? - Snakey. There won't be anymore Wednesday night concerts. - I don't guess I do understand. - Snakey, it's Ivy. You gotta give young girls special attention. Sort of full time attention, in fact. - I can't believe it's Burt Holden speaking. Ain't you ever gonna have a mind of your own anymore? - Look, Snakey. I'm giving you all this stuff here. All the stereo components. Speaker, turntable, amplifiers, everything. Records and all. - Aw, that damn dancing girl! You ought to be ashamed of yourself. - You better watch what you say about my wife, mister! - I knew she was gonna make trouble for us. I could see the way she was acting with you last night, wriggling around, dropping her clothes. - You spied on me? - You ought to keep your eyes open! She's just trying to take you, that's all! She's a gold digger! Just a selfish little gold digger! - You can't talk like that! (dark dramatic music) You ungrateful old fool! I ought to kick you off this place! Well those Wednesday night concerts would have never gotten started in the first place if it wasn't for my generosity! Well don't you expect me to be generous anymore! (Burt yelping) (dark ominous music) (slow foreboding music) (car crashing) - [Sis VOICEOVER] Find out all about you and that little schoolteacher. And I mean all. And I can guarantee you, she'll back our story to the hilt. She's on our side now. Not yours. - [Cynthia VOICEOVER] Don't come to my house tonight. There won't be any more Wednesday nights. - [Brother Joy VOICEOVER] I simply stood by and witnessed with approval as Miss Williams enlightened them. - [Cynthia VOICEOVER] What are you doing here this early? I told you never to come here this early! - [Sis VOICEOVER] What's the matter, Snakey? Don't you like the ranch? I ought to let Bud pop your head off like he does them slithering, slimy snake friends of yours. - [Brother Joy] All serpents work for the devil. (knocking at door) - Where's my husband? He was supposed to be here hours ago. - Well, he's out at the ranch. He sent me in after you. - Burt sent you after me? - Yeah, the chores he had to do turned out to be more than he expected. - Well what does he want me for? To hold a flashlight while he ropes a steer? - I don't know what he wants you for. But he's gonna be awful mad if you don't show up. - He's gonna be mad? I am the one who's mad. We were supposed to have left on our honeymoon hours ago. - Are you coming or not? - Oh, I don't know why I should, but I will. What do you think you're doing with those suitcases? - He told me to bring them along. Maybe you're leaving for Mexico from the ranch. (drum rolling) (tense music) (dark foreboding music) - Where's Burt? Where is he? What is going on here anyway? - Don't bother to look for him. He's dead. You turned him against me. Now you shouldn't ought to have done that. I warned you not to interfere with our Wednesday night concerts. Now you come along with me. - No! - Wait a minute... - Let me go! (Ivy screaming) (snake hissing) (Ivy screams) (Ivy whimpering) (screaming) (Ivy sobbing) Help! - Come on! - Help! - Give me your hand! (Ivy shrieking) (whimpering) (Ivy sobbing) Go on, get up. Get up! Come on. (tense music) You stay there. Follow me. Get up. Now you stay there. Come on. Get in there. - No, please. I don't... - Hurry up! Or I'll throw you down the ladder! Get down there. - What are you gonna do with me? - I'm gonna teach you a thing or two about suffering. (Ivy sobbing) Now get! (dark foreboding music) - What you doing here? How dare you come into my house without knocking? (Snakey chuckling) You get out of here! Get out! - I'm getting out. But you're going with me. Brother Joy, I walked all the way into town to see you, just so you could have the pleasure of driving me back home. (drum rolling) (dark foreboding music) You just stay put. I want you to rub it all over yourself. Your arms, your legs. Your chest. Come on, on your shins. That's enough. So, you're a little hungry, huh? (Snakey chuckling) This here cottonmouth, he ain't ate for three weeks now. Now, Brother Joy. You committed a pretty bad crime against my snakes when you cut off their food supply. - Brother Bender, as God as my judge... - I don't need his help. Already judged you myself, and you're guilty as hell. What we're discussing here is your punishment. - Brother Bender, Snakey, I'll do anything. Only don't kill me. - You're wasting your breath on me. The boy you ought to be talking to is right here. Mr. Cottonmouth himself. Because he's gonna be a combination jury and executioner. And if he decides to let you go free, then I'll let you live, but it's all up to him. That's why I had you rub the fish all over yourself, to help him make up his mind. You see, a cottonmouth, he'll strike at anything that smells a little fishy. - Oh my god. Please, God! - Well, I don't know. You may be able to get God to intercede for you, but it don't hardly seem possible. Seeing as how he's the one who gave this snake his appetite for fish in the first place! (dark tense music) (Snakey chuckling) (Ivy screaming) You better stay put. Movement makes him nervous. (tense foreboding music) - No! Don't! (dark foreboding music) Forgive me, God. (Ivy sobbing) - No! (dark tense music) (car crashing) (drum rolling) (lively band music) (door opening) (hammering on wood) (rock clinking) (hammering) (clinking) (hammering) (knocking against rock) - [Bud] Mrs. Holden! What are you doing in there? - Would you help me, please? Get me out of here? Hurry! (Ivy gasps) (dark foreboding music) - Well hi, Snakey. - Sure glad you're here, Bud. You saved me the trouble of coming to get you. (snakes rattling) Bud. This ought to be a real picnic for you. All you gotta do is snatch 'em up before they coil, and pop their heads off. (chuckling) Open your eyes, girl! (tense dramatic music) (Bud shrieking) - Oh god! No! (Snakey cackling) (Ivy screaming) (Bud shrieking) (Ivy screams) (dark dramatic music) (Ivy screaming) (car crashing) (exciting band music) (slow tense music) (phone ringing) - Hello? What are you doing calling me? I told you the other day, I... - No, I won't come in there no more. Don't you worry about that. But that ain't no reason why you can't come out here to the ranch. - No, I couldn't. - Well, you always wanted to see my whole snake collection. This here's your chance. - I shouldn't. Hundred? Hundred? No, I can't. I tell you, I absolutely can't. (slow tense music) Snakey? (knocking at door) Snakey? (knocking at door) - I see you're already enjoying my friends. - Oh Snakey, they're just beautiful. And there's so many. But where's Lucifer? - Forget Lucifer. - I hope you aren't angry with me anymore. You must understand, I didn't want to make the boys turn their animals loose, and the other things I said, I... - We ain't gonna talk about that now. Now, how do you want to get acquainted with my other snakes? Maybe several of them at one time? - Could I? (slow tense music) - Yeah. - Oh! My goodness. - This here's the king snake you was admiring. Now this species is the prettiest and the gentlest of all snakes. Gentlest, that is, where human beings are concerned. But he's a cannibal with other snakes. - Oh. Put that naughty little boy around my neck. (Cynthia moaning) (Cynthia moans) - I got you a bull snake here. Now they get pretty big, and he makes quite a show with his hissing. - Oh! Ooh! (Cynthia panting) - Now here I got you a big boa. He's pretty strong. And he likes to squeeze things. (Cynthia moaning) (Snakey chuckles) - Oh baby! Oh! Oh! (Cynthia panting) - This one here's a longnose. He likes to burrow. - Oh, my lovely darlings! Oh! Oh! My precious little boys! Oh! (Cynthia panting) (dark tense music) (Cynthia panting) - Miss Williams. Miss Williams? I got another snake for you. - Oh, please. Give him to me. - I don't know. This is copperhead. It ain't like the others. It's very, very poisonous. (Cynthia moaning) - Oh, give him to me! - Oh, okay. If you insist. (Cynthia moaning) - Give him to me. (dark foreboding music) (dramatic music) (Cynthia moaning) (Cynthia laughing) (shrieking) (Cynthia laughing) (moaning) (dark dramatic music) (Ivy screaming) (car crashing) (exciting band music) - I'm looking for that damn no-count brother of mine. He's disappeared, and so has the crazy schoolteacher. - Is that right? - Probably shacked up somewhere. Damn that billy goat! What about the cabin down by the crick? He used to take that creepy Milly Bass down there. - They ain't at the cabin. But I happen to know where they are. There ain't no reason why you can't join them. Where they are, nobody'll mind if you and Bud and a few snakes share the same woman. (dark tense music) Sis. Each one of these here barrels has got a snake in it but only one of them snakes is poisonous. Now what we got here is three bull snakes, and one coral snake. Now they're all untamed and they're all nervous, and they're all biters when they're that way. But only the coral snake will kill ya. Now, what you gotta do is pick out of the three barrels with the harmless snakes. And we'll forget the fourth one. That fair enough? Pick out your first barrel, Sis. (tense foreboding music) All right, then I'll do it for you! - No! No, no, no, no. I'll do it. The second one. - To the right? - No. No, from the left. (dark dramatic music) (Sis screaming) (Snakey laughing) - Bull snake. What's the second choice? - The first one. (Sis whimpering) (dark dramatic music) (Sis screaming) (Snakey laughs) - Another bull snake. What's your last choice? - The fourth. (Sis screaming) (dark dramatic music) Oh god! Oh no, that was the coral snake! No, not the coral snakes! - Sis. The last laugh is on you. All four of them barrels got coral snakes in them. - You dirty son of! (Ivy screaming) (truck crashing) (exciting band music) (Snakey laughing) - Well now. You sure did bring the most mice this time, Malcolm. - Told you I would. - Yeah. I like a man who keeps his word. Say, now Miss Williams has run off with Bud Palmer, who's your new schoolteacher? - My mom is. - Uh-huh. There. Now, let's see. That's four mice and three birds. That's 35 cents for you, Malcolm. And I thank you. Okay, that's all for today and I reckon I'll see you here next Wednesday, right boys? - You can depend on us from now on, Snakey. - [Boy] Bye, Snakey. - So long. Don't forget, next Wednesday. (Snakey chuckling) - Don't you worry now. I'll put these snakes on express truck in the morning. - Well, I think I ought to pay you something for your troubles. - No, no, no, no. You just buy your groceries and gas here. I'm happy to do this little service for you. (car engine starting) (lively country music playing) (car engine starts) (dark foreboding music) (lively country music) (dark tense music) (lively country music) (tense music) (country music) (tense music) - [Radio Announcer] Jimmy Tiner, Central City Feed Store now gives you, free of charge, that purty little song, "Are You Lonely Tonight?" (soft country music) - [Snakey] You looking for something? - You're damn right I'm looking for something. You. Now I know you're not the richest man in the county, but you've got to be taught a lesson. You've got to realize that it's mighty easy to kill somebody. You have no idea how nervous it makes me to give somebody a ticket, but that's what the job calls for. And doggone it, I'm gonna do my duty. Hey, I suppose you heard about Palmer and the schoolteacher taking off together? - Yeah, they was talking about it in town today. - Boy, with a rear end like hers, she coulda hooked somebody with some brains. What's your middle initial, Snakey? - W. - You know, that's one of the nice things about this job. You get to know some mighty interesting things about people. Now you take that preacher. Not many folks knew that he was tapping the church building fund. - Did you know about that all along? - Hell no. It ain't right to suspect a preacher. What's your license number? - How the hell would I know? - Oh, that's all right. Don't bother. Being tall comes in handy sometimes. Z-A-M-0-4-1. Z-A-M-0-4-1. Z-A-M-0-4-1. Now you take Sis Palmer. There's no telling what wild hare she got that made her take off and leave the store all locked up. - Probably off looking for Bud and that teacher. - Why the hell couldn't I have thought of that? (laughing) Z-A-M-0, oh, damn it. Z-A-M-0-4-1. Z-A-M-0-4 (laughing) You know, by the time Burt and his wife get back there might not be anybody left in town. (chuckling) That'd make you wonder, if you was using the wrong kind of soap. (laughing) Z-A-M-0... - 0-4-1. - Thanks. 0-4-1. All right. Well. I'll see you in town next Wednesday. (car engine starts) (hammering) (clock ticking) (clock chiming) - You ain't exactly my idea of a companion. I don't even like you. But my Wednesday nights ain't ever gonna be right again without somebody. Now. You're gonna learn all about band music and snakes. In no time at all. - You mean you aren't gonna kill me? - Just a matter of learning. Seeing as how I know all about band music and snakes, all you gotta do is pay attention. Now. Naturally, we'll start with John Philip Sousa, the greatest composer and musician who ever lived. (exciting band music) Yes! Oh, you shoulda heard him play this number in person! Well I did! Back in 1928, in a real big auditorium back east. And that place was packed with people. Now, Sousa and his boys, they played all his best marches. "The Thunderer", "Semper Fidelis", "El Capitan", and "Daughters of Texas". But it weren't till the end of the program that he played "The Stars and Stripes Forever" which of course is his very best composition. (Snakey laughing) Now, the first time through, they played it in a normal manner. But the second time, while them drums was pulling, the flutes and the piccolos, and the coronets, and the trombone...
