I discovered I just find when I examined my heart, I found ... I think there's love there. For you. Yeah. I love you. it wasn't... it wasn't really of love only being in use. I mean, as lonely as ever, I called on months you know just until I ... My parents thought of ... I don't know. I never told them. Never ... told anyone else. That was a pact. me and Amy were both there to go. enter the water and she didn't... didn't swim back. I swam back. I could ...I could... I do not know what we were so unhappy about. I mean ... How could we be so unhappy about ... I think you ...you are too young to know you can get over anything. He's always made poor decisions. same with her. I feel helpless. How long have you been with her? Since she was 8. You? Oh, Christ, it's got to be over 40 years. second grade. So he was a little old for you? I keep telling him that. He never listens. He never do? - No. What is your dig? I must have done them all. Monsters under the bed, a cheerleader, governor... These days have not been the right time to tell him the truth. And you? I'm crazy in love with her. - oh! tough one. - Yeah. It's been hurry. I think She's almost done with me. Good, Great, Run away while you can. Tell her to open the door and you run. You don't want to end up like me. I guess not. - Captain Excellent. - Christopher. Nice to meet you. See you around. Oh! What? What? What? Wait a second. Son of bitch! Do not react here. Do not tell me how to react. - It's not like that. - Shut up. What? What is this? Richard Who is that? Who the fuck is that? She is the babysitter. Get out. Get out. Get out! Hi, Lucy! Hi, Peter! Hi Claire we'll just be ... I did not sleep with the babysitter, if that's what you think of. Oh, that is so comforting. Why do we even have a babysitter? It was just a kegger, Claire. That was all. just a kegger? And with whom exactly did you have a kegger? just kids from high school . Richard, just stop. none of this is ok. -ok You knew we were coming this weekend. Why are you doing this? I've been a bit at a loss. what a bullshit answer. I was being flandering and Abby was being ... What? Abby was being what? A friend. For God's sake, that is not a friend, that's a child. - You do have friends. - No, I do not. I think that is a touble here... Cause you do not have a relate to other human beings. Yeah, you isolate yourself. Oh, you can talk. What the hell is that supposed to mean? You can be cold, Claire. I think we just get out of here. We just get out of here leave this area. - Where? - I do not know, anywhere. I don't know if it's your profession or what... you know, but it makes your heart. I cannot and I don't accept that. I wanna to have a baby Is that what this is all about? We could have a baby, Claire. Why did not we have a baby? Why? Because you're a baby. You're an enfant. You still have an imaginary friend. I just wanted a little warm thing. Something simple I could start with. A simple relationship with a person that was new and pure. well, I could be me, they could be them. and that's all I've expected we can build. In this world there's someone other than me to think about and be about. and the relief of being able to give the world to someone else and let it be there and let them have their turn. so it doesn't end with me. Well that's all you, Where do I come in? What do you mean? God, you're the mother. Ah, I am so sorry, guys. We are gonna go we're just gonna go... We can be just anywhere Anywhere. I'm so sorry.- No no no. All right. We're just going out -I will walk you out I'm sorry Wish you all go on a crew or something Okay. Okay. Take care. Alright. if we are gonna do this, let's ... Alright, by the way, what's she like? like 13,14? At least we'll get the fact straight. It was you, Richard. you didn't want to have a baby. you weren't ready. so that little fuzzy fucking speech my friends had to hear was bull shit. now, I know that I'm... I can't. so I guess I am the bad guy. No not the novel that's... I'd rather you didn't... What is this? What is this? That's it. After all this time out here and this is it? this is That? Maybe you should spent more time working instead of ... fucking the babysitter. - No. I. .. - You're useless. -Yes - You are totally useless! - Yes. I am. What is wrong with you? I do not know what to do with my hands. Everyone. Janeth, my sister and Olive all have been made I have the one who made me laugh. What happened? I do not know what happened. You stopped laughing. - May I help you? - Yeah. I came here to pay my respects. - sorry? - Heath Hen, the North American Heath Hen... it's where the last one lived and died. I don't know anything about the Heath Hen. But you are welcome to look around. We've got several varieties of proper. Thank you. So that is what the end of something looks like. The world went on, Richard. But never the same. We do not know how much it changes things. but it is just being here. The ripple of the fact. if the chicken hadn't died out here, you will be perfectly adusted. Maybe. Doubtful. Instead of a child, I am a loser and I am condemned to believe in Captain. it's like a little hand. It's ...It's time for you to go. No. You know what I am saying, Captain. I mean, go and never come back. I'm not ready. it doesn't matter. You can not help me anymore. The doctor is right. but You will be alone. Yes as the last of my kind. OK. do the voice. One last time. Please. When the world is peril. When evil surrounds you. When danger is lurking. Who do you call? Captain Excellent! I wish I had a really amazing and vital father like him. Captain? Richmond regarded his solitude... The ... Merton regarded his solitude ... Norton regarded his solitude ... Horton regarded his solitude ...Norton thought ... Norwood regarded his solitude...The ... Richard? Richard? Richard! Richard regarded his solitude as something sacred. I had dreams last night and uh. .. you were in it. ah? was it interesting? you were you. You're leaving, aren't you? yeah, you know, because of the - situation ... - Yeah. I figured it. You know, spring is ... my favorite time. cause summer has not arrived yet. and it's not fucking cold. uh ... I. .. I made something for you. It is the swan. The beautiful and graceful swan. It's ...Richard, it's perfect. yeah Thank you. It seems like that we were just come started. Take care. Okay. okay I am a horse's ass. Yes, you are. I am sorry. I kind of need some help to get this couch in. Richard regarded his solitude as something sacred. As well as a badge of honor. A clock to be warned of warm to life As well as safety. Solitude is who he was. This cast those into his lives to make him feel barely content. Richard was certain that there was not lined. It was just hard on man. maybe it was because he gave nothing and he received nothing in return. In any case, the situation became untolerable. the closed things he had as his friends were either imaginary or extinct. Richard had reached a point in his life but it was no longer enough. And then he met a girl. And she was warm. And she was sad. And she was maybe lonely in a way that reminded him of himself. She lost things that no girl had lost. And she knew things. And she taught him. And Richard thought maybe that was what friendship feels like. Maybe. It was just in the blinks. it barely began really. But in those long few winter days. She gave him so much. Enough so that Richard could go on. And what did he give her? Just a few words on a page. Not much, perhaps. But for Abby. He hoped that was enough. Okay.
