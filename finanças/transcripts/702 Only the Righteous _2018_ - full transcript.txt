Tonight, we're going to elect our first African American president. A historic night for everybody. - Man, if you say history one more time I'ma hurt you. - Ladies and gentlemen, this is my elder brother, Kane Demetrius Israel, but please call him KD. Do not call him by his whole name. Don't do that, he hates that. He's a Leo, he likes popcorn shrimp, moonlit rolls on the beach and 80's ballad by Tiffany. ♪ I think we're alone now. ♪ - Hey, we'll you get that camera out of my face? ♪ I think we're alone now. ♪ - That's alright, he just sore 'cause Debbie Gibson was always better. Shake Your Love, Foolish Beat, Lost In Your Eyes. I mean come on now. Anyway, little bit about myself. I was born and raised in the county of Dade, Opa-locka, Florida which is of course the backdrop for this evening's event. A graduate of Norland Senior High School. That's right, the mighty Vikings, and a member of the University of Miami School of Medicine. That's right, ladies, I'm a doctor. Don't worry about it, I'm taken, anyway. - Yo, yo, yo man, look, if you gonna be doing all that why don't you go on to the room? Or go outside or something, I mean you see I'm in here working. - Work? No, no, no, no bruh. Listen, tonight is not about work. Tonight, we are about to have a histor-- About to have a party. - How much is this? I had a go at 10 man, put the rest on pump three. Alright, thanks man. - Go ahead on, man. - Whatever man. - Hey man, let me get a gar, man. No, Backwoods. - Bruh, you got a light? - Yeah, I got a light. I don't smoke though, least not no more. All this gas, you ain't about to burn me up in flames. - You know what, you right, you right but brother, you know it's kind of crazy out here so go head on and be safe, alright? - Yeah, alright, you be safe too, homie. - Ant called yet? - No. - You wanna wait on him a little bit longer? - Nope. - Well the food's ready. I could get my mother to drop us off. - Thank you, that'd be nice. - Ma, drop us off at Ant's house. - Why don't you just drive yourself? - I told you how I felt about tonight. I'm not driving tonight. - Then why don't you just stay home? - Mother, I'm a grown woman. I can make my own decisions, Jesus. - Alright, alright, okay. Don't forget to wear your sweater. - Mother! - Did y'all pack the food in the car already? - Yes, ma. Geez. Listen, I know you don't understand and I know you think I'm crazy but none of that matters right now. Tonight is different. I need you to just stay home, don't answer the door, just pray and wait for the shadow to pass over, okay? - Should we put goat's blood on the door and call Moses? - Mother, I'm serious. It's not funny. If you're not going to listen to me I can't help you. - Oh girl, shut up, you know I'm just playing with you. You don't have no sense of humor? How you deal with Inez? - I ask myself that every day. - Really? Do you read every day? - Uh-huh. - Same thing or different passages? - A different chapter of Proverbs for every day of the month. - Does it help? Inez? Does reading every day help? Knock knock. - What? - Reading, every day, does it help? - Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, it keeps me straight. - What's up, player? Y'all better lock that door. - Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce Dwayne Shepherd otherwise known as the Shep. Aka D-Shep, aka Big Bo Peep, aka Little Gold Herder, aka you know the rest. - Whoa, whoa, whoa black man, where you been? - Over yonder way, yeah. - Across the field? - Nah, nah, nah, past that, past that. - Over there across the water? - No, no, no keep going past the water. - Over there in them mountains? - Higher than that, up there with them shepherd's. KD. You don't know what's funny or not, you bastard. - Hey hold up, man, you brought your camera? - Bam! Of course I got my camera, man, what you think this is? I'm a man of my word. - Stop. Chill, chill, don't break my stuff, don't break. Yo man! - Hey, how did it go in practice man? Did y'all get in the ring? - Well I made your boy Chris tap out. - Yeah right. What? - Yeah, got in the ring and made him tap out. That boy's soft, man, he gone. Your girl Summer, she took his heart a long time ago. That boy done, done. - We are here in front of the Dade County Courthouse and the verdict on Thomas Crow is in. The verdict is not guilty. - You have got to be kidding me. - All seven counts of murder in the first degree. The cold blooded murder of the seven little girls involved in the bombing at King Elementary School-- - Man, that's ridiculous. - Clearly there is shock and terror, emotion and electricity fill the air. We caught up with district attorney Xavier Marshall, the prosecuting attorney on the case and clearly as you can see he is heartbroken. - That verdict is not reflective of the state's position. I'm sorry. Our prayers go out to the victims, the families of the victims of this most horrific tragedy. It will not be forgotten. Thank you, that's all.. - Yeah well if you people paid your rent on time I wouldn't have to come around to your freaky houses. - Mr. Rumineski. - Yeah? - Something we can help you with? - I'm coming here on the fourth. Just a reminder that the rent is due on the fifth or it's late. You know, I'm not gonna send anymore notifications or paperwork and I'm not paying any lawyer. What I am gonna do is I'm gonna call the sheriff and he can take care of all those people that don't pay. I'm not gonna do this anymore. - Mr. Rumineski, what does that have to do with any of us, I mean we've always paid you on time. Our payment is in for this month. - No it's not. - What? - You boys are usually on time but not this time, no. - cracker. - Look, I know it's close to Christmas and I know you people like to spend a lot of money but you've gotta get your priorities straight. - Mr. Rumineski, I slipped the check under your door the other day. - Check? - Yeah, I slipped a check under your door just the other day. - I don't take checks. - Why, the check is good. - Don't trust them new niggas over there. - Mr. Rumineski, you know what, I'm gonna, first thing in the morning I'll come by with a money order. Okay? - Alright, you boys are good boys. - Boy? - Have a good night, I'll see you tomorrow morning. - Have a good night Mr.-- - Don't mind him, don't mind, you have a good night. Okay, and I'll see you in the morning. - What are you carrying on for? Get away from my car. - See? That's what I'm talking about. I told you to pay that man. See you play too much. - I did, I gave him a check, KD. - Told you to give him a money order! A money order! See that's your problem. You don't listen, man. You play too much. - You know what man? You need to get up off me, man. I'm a grown man, bruh. - Really? Well if you're so grown why is it necessary that you remind me of that? Shouldn't I just know that? - You need to chill, man. You really need to chill. You need to chill man. What you need to do is really chill. Who is this? - Hey Ant. - Hey. - We got chicken wings and fried rice. - Thank you, thank you, thank you. How did y'all get here? - My mother dropped us off. - Your mama? I didn't-- Damn, shut up. - We were waiting on you. But we figured you forgot or fell asleep or something like that. - I was on my way. - Really? - Baby, I was on my way, come on now. - Please. We're here now. What's up, Shep? - Ha, ain't nothing shaking but the leaves in the tree that wouldn't be shaking if it wasn't for me. - You are so crazy. How you doing, KD? I said hello, KD. - Actually you asked me how I was doing so I figured you could see how I was doing. - Okay, y'all can have the food and we'll just go, alright? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - What, clearly we're not welcome here. - Baby, don't worry about KD. He is tripping, he been up for three days on NoDoze and energy drinks and God knows what else but he is tripping, don't worry about him. Don't let him ruin our good time. We're supposed to have a party now, right? Party, right? - You know, you should count yourself fortunate that I kind of like you. - Oh I do, I do. - Whatever, what's all this? - Well this, my love, is the recording of history. My directorial debut. - No, no, Ant, stop. - Come on, come on now baby, say something to the camera, come on now. - Alright, what do you wanna know? - Well tell us who you are. - Inez Miller, what else? - Tell us something about yourself. - Well what do you know about me? - Well from what I know of you you are a beautiful, intelligent, spiritual and forgiving woman. - Good answer. - What, pray tell, is your relationship to the amazingly handsome young man behind the camera? - The young man behind the camera is my boyfriend. My habitually tardy boyfriend. - Why you gotta bring up old stuff, huh? - It's getting crowded out there. What are they having, a block party or something? - A tear down a block party more like it. - Tear down the block, what's that? - Oh y'all ain't heard of them? - Heard what? - The verdict from the Thomas Crow case came back. They let him go. - What? - Not guilty? - Not guilty, just like OJ but in reverse. - Oh my lord. - Them boys gonna act a fool, especially when Barack lose. - Hold, hold, hold on man, hold on now. We are here to witness history and we will. Yes we can, yes we can. - No, don't get me wrong, player. I know we can and I know we should but will we? Shout out for him brother. I done prayed to the Koran that the lord protect him and his family and whatnot but will they let him lead the country? I doubt it. - Will they let him lead? - Yeah, will they let him lead the country? - I don't think it's up to them. - Then who's it up to? - Tonight on Dateline, two minds, two opinions, one much finer than the other, let's watch. - The people that voted for him, the people that support him and ultimately God. - Which God, whose God? I know I serve God and from what I know about you you serve God. You see we've got a bit of an impasse on what we call him but it's okay and sha Allah, you'll come around. What I'm saying is this. The God I'm talking about is not necessarily the God they talking about. You see, some people God is money. Some people God is stature and power. Some people God is government. In God we trust, what kind of God you trust? - There is only one God. - True, I know that so what you trying to say? - Alright, you making some logical points but answer one simple question. - Okay. - Do you believe in God? - Yes I do. What kind of God you talking about? - The God, the only one, the one that created us. - You see this right here, you see this hat? What that say? Bismiallah. You know what that mean? That mean in the name of God. The only one created, the one that created us. That answer your question? Yes, I believe in God. - Alright, and that God is all powerful, correct? - Correct. - Then tell me, what's impossible for him? What can't he make happen if it's in his will? If he wants Barack Obama to be elected then he will be and there nothing you, me, or anybody else can say to prevent that. - Some people say he's the antichrist. - What? - Come on with that. - I'm serious and they can prove it. - Prove what? - That he's the antichrist. It's in the bible. - It is not in the bible that Barack Obama is the antichrist. - Well it does say that all nations will love him and that there will be this charismatic leader that will just come out of nowhere. - Hold on, don't bring that crap up in here. Now see I know you bought the chicken and what not but them damn wings ain't that damn good. - I ain't gonna lie brother, these wings is good. Fire pon di wings! - You a fool. - Shep, you tell me. - Yeah? - What do you think is gonna happen? - Well I can't tell you what's gonna happen but I can tell you what has happened. I remember 2000, my memory ain't that short. It ain't short enough to think that everything's gonna be okay. It ain't gonna be okay. - You stupid, dog. - You can tell that by what happened today. - That's the most intelligent thing that you've said all night. - Well, here comes Clarence Thomas with an opinion. Go ahead, tell us what you think Judge Thomas. - You really think that's an insult? By calling me a supreme court justice? One of the most powerful, most intelligent black men in this country, supreme court justice, that's an insult? You just proved my point. - And what is your point, KD? - My point is that despite of what happens here tonight nothing's going to change about you, nothing's going to change about how this country sees you. When you go to sleep tonight, they'll still look at you as a nigga and contrary to your delusions of grandeur, when you wake up in the morning you will still be looked at as a nigga regardless of what happens here tonight and you believe in that change. - Ladies and gentlemen, we just got filmed evidence that the slave field mentality still exists. Just call him Toby. - That's the name that I sign on your tuition checks. - So you gonna start hopping on that, huh? You gonna bring that back up? What, that make you feel big? You feel like a man? - Who is it? Who is it? - No, what you need to do is keep Peaches' name out your mouth and find you some business and stay out of mine. Shut up, who is you? tripping, I swear to God. Hey now, Peaches up in this piece. What's wrong with y'all? What kind of party is this? Y'all ain't playing no music. Y'all sitting around like somebody stole your dog. - We was waiting on you! - Well I'm here and I brought the liq. What's up, KD? You can't say hi to your neighbor? - How you doing, Peaches? - Fine as you can see. Anyway, I invited some of my girls over from the club, y'all don't mind do you? - Oh nah, nah, they don't go to work til 10, right? Yeah, they can come over. - What is this? Y'all got a dead zone in here or something? I have no reception, no bars. - I'm sorry, yeah, you can't get no good cellphone reception in here. Yeah, you probably have to step outside. - And that might not help either. This apartment is so close to electrical transformers on that light pole that it may block all reception. - Okay. Y'all got a house phone? - What? - Are you not gonna say something? - Say what? - You're cool list now, alright. Deb, let's go. - What, come on. Look, look, look, I'm sorry, alright, I'm sorry but you know how Peaches is. - You know how I am. I've changed my life and I don't go for this foolishness. I mean I will not be a part of or the company of confusion. Y'all wanna drink and have a good time, knock yourself out but I'm not interested. - Okay baby, listen, listen, listen. These people are my neighbors but you are my lady, okay, please? - Stop. You know I can't resist that. It's a serious moment. - Please, baby, baby, please. - Spike Lee you're not. - No, but I'm working on it. - Yeah, whatever. - What's that? - Boy, you are a true fool. KD, man, where the other deck tapes for this thing at? - I have no idea. - Well have you seen 'em around anywhere? - What does I have no idea mean besides I have no idea. Check the hall closet. - Okay. You know, you done got a case of the slick mouth, got all these people around. But don't worry about it, I know where you stay. You got to go to sleep sometime. There's something wrong with you. - So what do you want me to do? - Oh, just talk about yourself. - Just talk about myself? Boy, don't play with me. You didn't bring me all the way up in your bedroom just to talk about myself. I could have talked about myself on the couch. - Hold on, hold on, hold on now. It ain't like that, I have a girlfriend. - Oh, okay, is she here? - What? - Nigga, did I stutter? Is she here? - Nah, but what that mean? - Exactly, it don't mean nothing so why don't you put that camera down and really come and interview me. - Oh, oh, okay. - Oh, I wish a cracker would. I wish a cracker would try to hurt this man. I wish they would. A nigga would tear this country up you know what I'm saying? If they try to hurt this man, they think them fools out there tripping? They think they out there acting a fool? Let them try to hurt this man or his family and it's gonna be some smoke in the city. It's gonna be a misunderstanding in United States of America. - Girl what is you gonna do if something jump off? Nothing. - Who ain't gonna do nothing? - You ain't gonna do nothing. - You must not know about me. You must not know about me. Peaches ain't always that sweet, I'ma tell you that right now. - What in the world with them? - Just some fools out there being ignorant, shooting up in the air. - Oh, Peaches, look, another state. - Oh my God, I think he's gonna do it. - Man, he ain't gonna do jack. - Hey hold on, hold on man. Watch your mouthpiece, bruh. Don't be bringing that pessimism up in here. What you bring that pessimism up in here for? - I put no faith in this, in the government, and that's a man. I don't put no faith in no man, bruh. KD had a point when he said you gonna wake up the next day after the election and nothing gonna change. You just gonna go to work and pay the bills just like everybody else. He's a man. A leader, I'll give him that, but a man just like you and me. What you think, gonna snap his fingers and everything gonna be okay? I bet you any money if they put that brother in office they gonna expect him to do everything and make it alright but it ain't gonna happen. You know why? 'Cause anything that mess up in the world, they gonna blame it on him. If it rain too hard it's his fault. If your wife leave you, it's his fault. If you scratch your ass 'cause you ain't cleaning good enough, it's his fault. I already see it coming. - What if he is the antichrist? - Fuck! - Nah, nah, nah, you done said that twice. I wanna hear what you got to say. Go ahead, talk the talk. - I'm just saying. Everybody says that these are the last days. It's been predicted that the Earth will be destroyed in 2012, Nostradamus. - Who is a false prophet. - Scientists and other historians talk about us being in the end times and then all of a sudden, he comes along. I mean really, is it really just all coincidence? That's what they said. - Well how you feel about that? - I just told you how I feel. - No, no, tell us what you really believe. Tell us how you feel about that. - I believe that where there's smoke, there's fire. - There's in it. - There's fire. I read my bible, I know about the rapture. - Do you? - Yes I do. I know about the six seals and the mark of the devil. It's like a barcode they're gonna put on your forehead or something. - , it's the seven seals and the mark of the beast. See this my problem with people misquoting the bible. - This fool said six seals. Nigga, don't you mean sixth sense? - I see dead people. - You busy? - What? - Are you busy? You seem really lost in your work. - Yeah, I got a lot of work to do. - What is it that you're working on? - Public analysis reports. Can I help you with something? - I was just, you know, making conversation. You seem kind of by yourself over here. I know how it feel-- - I'm not by myself, okay, I don't need a friend or a hug, I need you to get the hell out of my face so I can work. - Who is you, man? - Y'all having a party in there? - I said who is you, dog? - Yeah, y'all got chicken in there? - Nigga. KD, man, you know this cat? - Look man, this is a private party. - Can't come to the party? - No. - You sure. - The fuck is wrong with you? - Hold on bruh, hey, we got a problem here? Do we have a problem here? Is there a problem? - It's not a problem. - Alright then. - Hey, but y'all be safe in there. - Yeah, we'll be safe, go on man. - Don't worry about that man. They just trying to get in here 'cause of all these females in here. Hey, hold on man. You brought some real fire in here? - No, I stole the remote control. No, but they ain't know that though. It's the way you bring it to 'em. It's the approach. You gotta run up on 'em. - Hey, but you know KD do got that real cutter in his briefcase, he don't think I know but he do got it. - Well if he got it up there, he gotta bring it out, we gotta use it. Hopefully it won't go that far though. - Come on now, it's a party, it's a party. - Look, Deb, don't be mad, okay? - Why would I be mad? My best friend embarrasses the hell out of me in front of a whole group of people. Why would I possibly be mad about that? - Deb, I am your friend and you know that but I know you and what you're doing and you don't have to try to impress anybody. - Impress somebody? Who am I trying to impress, Inez? - Excuse me, y'all. - Who am I trying to impress? - You know what, forget it, don't worry about it. - No, you my friend, tell me. Who am I trying to impress? Is it because I'm not as perfect as you that you think I'm trying to impress somebody? - What did you just say? - I said because you act like you so perfect and since I don't act like you then I'm trying to impress somebody? - That's twice she said that. - If you don't mind, this is an A, B conversation. A, B, thank you. Deb, and you've been drinking so we can talk about this later. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, mother may I. I don't know what your problem is. I didn't do nothing to you so don't raise your voice at me. - Be sure that when I raise my voice at you you'll know it. - Look who puffing they chest up. Look, boo, I ain't the one, okay? So go over there, get your praying on, whatever it is you do, get all on your knees, your bible, do all that and stay out of grown folks business. - You recognize my face from somewhere? Maybe your hood. I come in here nice and easy and I don't say nothing to you, alright. Don't mistake the grace inside of me for weakness. - Whatever. Ant, come get your girl, come get your girl. - come in here and don't say nothing to this woman and she come fast with me. I think she want me see myself. - Whatever, whatever. I hear you talking, mother may I, okay? But that's all you better do if you don't wanna get beat down. - Yo! Can't you see I'm trying to work? What don't you people understand that I'm trying to work in my own home? - Hey y'all, the election's about to come on. - I don't care, get out of my house. - You ain't gotta tell me twice. Whatever y'all. Next time, bitch. - Oh, so, Satan get me hands. Oh, she come in the air. - Okay baby, okay baby, chill, chill. Listen, Peaches, look, if you gonna leave, leave, but don't disrespect my lady in my house, okay? - Disrespect? Don't make me blow up your spot, okay? Please, don't get embarrassed and get your girl beat down in the same night. - Get out of my house! - Yo listen, KD, chill man. - All the polls have closed and our major affiliates are now ready to announce that Barack Obama is the 41st president of the United States of America. - Y'all relax, relax, relax. Are y'all cool, are y'all cool? - Are y'all alright? - I'm fine. - Okay, listen, everybody just calm down. Is everybody okay? - Everybody's fine. - It's good and y'all calm down. - Who is poking me? - Calm down, calm down. - Listen stop, stop, just relax. The emergency lights will kick in in a second. It's gonna be okay. - Can't be over there crying. - Relax. - She alright, she alright. - Why you crying? - We're gonna die. - Deb, stop that mess. - It's gonna be okay. - Just shut up, KD. - Whoa, yeah, told y'all, no need to fear. - Told you baby. It's gonna be alright. Probably just some fools out there shooting the transformer out but we gonna be alright now that we got these emergency lights on. - I gotta make sure these fools ain't messing with my car. Where's my keys? - Girl, I got your keys, I'll go check it. - Nah, B, B. - Oh my God! - Get away from the door! - Oh my God, they just shot my girl Davia. I can't be part. - Relax, listen, listen!

That's him, he's alive. You're a doctor. You have to help him, Ant. - The hell he does! - Okay, okay, okay, I'll help him. Okay, I'll help him. - No, no, Ant, just hold on and wait for the police. - Baby listen. There's no ambulance that's coming here. Ain't no police coming here to save us, okay, especially if this is happening all over the city. I can go up there and stabilize him just long enough for us to get help on something, okay? - Man, that's a bad idea. - What do you think this is? What the hell are you thinking? You run the risk of opening that door and having those fools run in here? - Everybody just calm down. Listen, listen, listen for a second. See, it's quiet up there now. I can get out here and go right upstairs. It's okay. Baby, it's okay, okay? Don't worry, Shep will come with me. - I will? - Yes you will, stop playing, dog. Let's go. - Tripping, man. Alright, hold up, hold up. If we gonna do this bruh, let's do it like this. If we go out there, we get separated and there's too many people out there, promise me you gonna run. - I ain't gonna run-- - Just promise you gonna run. You can't save everybody, man. You're not Superman, alright? - Okay, okay, alright. - Give me your word. - Baby, just-- - Give me your word! - I give you my word, alright? - Alright, let's do this on three. - Alright. - One, two ... - I told you. It's the rapture. People are disappearing one by one. - Look, I don't like this. I think they've been gone for too long. KD? We should call the police. - With what? A cup and string? We have no phone! - Just hold on man, I told y'all-- - Move, move, move. - Oh my God! - It's alright. - I don't wanna die. - Mr. Rumineski, I'm gonna take care of you now. - Did they see you bring him in here? - What? - Did they see you bring him in here? - What are you talking about, KD? - Look, if they know that he's in here and he's alive, they're gonna come in here and finish the job and finish us too. Why would you do that, that was so stupid! - KD, this man has multiple lacerations and possible internal bleeding, if I don't do something right now, he will die. Do you understand that? Them cats are gonna do whatever they have to do and I'm gonna do whatever I have to do. - Please, help me. - It's gonna be okay, we're gonna take care of you. - Ant, listen to your brother, okay? - Inez, what would you have me do? Let this man die right here and bleed out right here on this couch or take him less than 15 minutes away where we can save him? What would you have me do? - I'd rather you be safe. - I know, baby, I know. - Look man, we got a bloody white man on the couch. What we gonna do? - Where's your car? - It's right outside. - Okay, come on, come on, come on, let's go. We're gonna need somebody to come with us just to open the door. - Okay, I will. - What? - If these are the last days, I wanna do something worthwhile. - Okay, my God, everybody just stop talking like this for a minute, just be quiet and let's think about this. - Okay, we gonna be alright, just close the door behind us. - No, if you insist on going then I'm going.
