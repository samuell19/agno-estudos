This story is set in the 1980s Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir... Nothing will happen to you, sir. Nothing will happen to you, sir. You'll be fine. Sir, nothing will happen to you. Doctor! Doctor! Is he going to be okay? You go out. He will survive, right? Get out first. Give me the torch. Start CPR. Come on. Do it, quick. Get the adrenaline injection. A FEW MONTHS AGO Black cobra, with Lord Krishna's feet on its hood, around three feet long, has a scar from a mongoose bite on its body. It bit me four days ago. Witch doctor Subbadu saved me. I'm looking for it now. I will not let it go, I will kill it. This is its skin. If the skin is here, it wouldn't have gone far. It must be caught. No idea why, but I keep finding something whenever I search for this snake. My name is Chitti Babu. I am the engineer for this village. Everyone looks at the sky when their crops need water in any village. But my villagers look for me. Chitti Babu, when will you water my crops? I told you, I will water them the day after tomorrow, all right? Impatient old man. Why did you water only half of my field, Chitti Babu? Because you paid only half. Hey, Chitti Babu, watch out. What, rascal? Why does everyone always yell? Can't you speak softly like a normal person? If someone yells again, he's had it. -Not that, man... -I will hit you with the pipe. Speak softly now. Nothing much. They are cutting the tree there, so walk carefully. Yes, that's the right way to talk. I should water your half-acre, right? Okay, I will. Not just yours, but I will water his, his and everyone else's. I won't leave anyone. Hey, Chitti Babu! Hey, Chitti Babu, stop! Why are you yelling? I am the only one who can help you. Would any fairy water your field? Chitti Babu, move! Oh, no! Hey! Now you understand why they were yelling so loudly? Because I am hard of hearing and one has to yell for me to hear. This is my engine problem. That's why everyone in the village calls me engineer. No, no... They call me the sound engineer. But this deficiency is a boon to me. Hey, Chitti Babu. He wants me to clear his debt. I hear him. But I pretend as if I can't hear him. That means I can hear some sounds and can see some. Deaf rascal. He said something and I saw it. Hey, Erra Babu. Come back. What? You said something as you were passing by. I didn't say anything. You said something. I saw your lips move. Tell me what you said. Oh, that? I just asked, "Is the chutney fine?" -No, you said something else. -What did I say? "Idiot." Say it. "Idiot." No sound. "Idiot." Not that, Erra Babu. It should be a bit lengthier... Oh, no. "Dirty rascal." "Dirty rascal." Erra Babu, the lips didn't meet. What would that be? "Deaf rascal." -Say it. -He caught me. -Say it. -No. Say, "deaf rascal." Deaf rascal. Deaf rascal. Yes, that's it. I have a disciple to tell me all that I miss. What's the news? Play the cassette. We started with the engine early in the morning. We met Papayamma while throwing the dung water. She asked with love, "Hey, Chitti Babu, will you eat the cheese?" Why will she not ask? I've given her a discount of 10 rupees for the engine. She should ask. Then Aunt Rangamma shouted loud enough for everyone to hear. You might have heard that. Only Aunt Rangamma speaks loud enough for me to hear. Even this engine is hers. She has a loud voice and a soft heart. She helps the needy. Dear, you will have kids, too. Yeah, sure. My husband's gonna return from Dubai, and I'm gonna have kids. Here's 20 rupees. Hey, Aunt Rangamma. If you don't return it... -Hey, Aunt Rangamma. -Hey... Wait. ...I'll ask in front of everyone and embarrass you. Look at what I found. A nice watch. Take this and give me 100 bucks. Here. Take it. How is it? It will look great on Uncle, right? It looks good on you. What? I said it looks good on you. Whatever. Okay. Here, your 100. -Keep it, dear. -My darling. I didn't mention our village name, did I? Rangasthalam! Rangasthalam The real story is just starting. What, Narasamma, looks like you have a bumper crop this year. You must be on cloud nine. Yeah, brother, it's all my son's hard work. He works hard day and night in order to get his sister married this year. He is my nephew, after all. -It's all about your marriage. -Oh, go away. This is an advance of 3,000 rupees. I will make full payment on delivery. -By when? -I will pay, okay? We hereby inform everyone that, as Chikkam Narasamma did not repay the loan taken from the Society, the crops from this land belong to the Society. No one should reap the crop or work in this field. If anyone does so... Why are you planting flags? Your loan was repaid long back, right? Oh, no, no. The public does not have proper rationale. Did you dream that your loan is repaid? You repaid the compound interest, but the principal is still pending. What do we know about all these calculations? As you didn't ask, we thought it's all cleared. We have been paying all that we earned in the past six years, we don't understand how it is still not repaid. What can I do? I am the Society President. You shout if I collect money and he shouts if I do not. See how the officer is sitting in the jeep like a swollen potato? Hey, looks like you've paid the advance? Have you reduced 10 rupees per bag as you are paying in cash? I'm paying 100 rupees per bag. Pay the balance to the Society and take the seed bags. I'm planning my daughter's marriage this year. I cannot do it after this year. Show me some mercy, sir. There is no lack of men in this village, right? Give another chance to a widower like me. Hey! Oh, no. Brother... Namaste, sir. It's all over. My son is dead. He has left me and gone. Why do you cry? What do we do when there is a tree full of fruits? We look for the ripe fruit, cut it and eat it. Even God is like us, he looks for the right guy and takes him away. Think of it this way. His debt to God has been cleared. Here, look into the funeral proceedings. Sir... Sir... He is the president of our village. He's been unanimously elected for the past 30 years. No one even nominates against him. Here, it's a single party, a single flag. He is the judge and his word is law. Not just in front of him, but none dare to walk with slippers even in front of his house. He is really crazy about the radio. He is very religious. He worships all year long. Some believe that he has special powers and that something bad will happen to anyone who opposes him. It's election time again. As always, he is the only nominee for the president's post. Hail, President, sir! It is like a celebration in the village when he files the nomination. Ranga, Ranga in Rangasthalam Ranga, Ranga in Rangasthalam Play it such that it can't just be heard, but it can be seen, too.

Give that guava here. If you're facing this side, how will you know if the bus comes? You won't be sitting here when the bus comes, will you? Won't you take your guavas and run off? Guava, guava, guava, guava! Guava, guava, guava, guava! Hey, Chitti, how are you? How is everyone at home? Is Sister all right? Chitti? Hey, Chitti. What happened? Why are you not talking? We had a fight before he left. He yelled at me for wearing his shirt. Since then, we haven't spoken to each other. Hey, Chitti, I am talking to you. How is everyone at home? Hey. I am talking to you. Are you still angry? Hey, sorry, man. It's been so long since he came and he still hasn't apologized. He is full of ego. Hey, sorry, man. I said sorry, right? Talk now. What? I didn't understand. I didn't understand what you said either. I don't know when he will ever understand. Hey, Chitti. Chitti! Sorry, man! Finally, he said it. -Are you fine, brother? -I'm fine. What did you bring for me from Dubai? Hey. Hey. As Rongali Chandramma did not repay the loan taken, her house has been seized. I'll fall to your feet, sir, please don't blame my daughter-in-law. Then agree that your son has come, and I will agree that your daughter-in-law is blameless. Come on, agree. Get your hands off her. Hey, Kumar, when did you come from Dubai? Just now. What happened? Nothing much. It has been three years since her son, meaning her husband, left for Koita and she has a year-old kid in her lap. She says her daughter-in-law is blameless. I don't understand how the kid was born. Don't speak ill of her. I know her son had come last year. Yes, Chinababu, he came here, enjoyed good food, and left without repaying his debt. Who will repay the debt now? Hey, push them out and lock the house. Wait. Wait. How much should they pay? Our Society is very kind, if you pay the interest for now, we shall leave. Pay 1,000 rupees. Give it to him, Chitti. Come on, just give it. There may be people without food in the village, but none without a debt. -Hey, Chinababu. -Yes? -Get the vehicle. -Go inside. Brother's arrived. -Did your trip go well? -Yes, it did. Hey, be right there. How are you, Mom? Aunt, put some extra red chili, I think my evil sight may hit him. Not one or two chilis, but a sack of chilis is required, go. That's enough. Dad, have you seen the eye doctor? Yes, I did, son. He asked me to stop stitching at nights. How is that possible? Wash your feet. Brother. When did you come? Just now, dear. -Are you studying well? -Yes. What did you get? For you? Brother, that Jyothi bought a cycle long back. I want one. Enough, idiot, don't pester him. Why is everyone shouting, Mom? It has become a habit. Always yelling so that he can hear. Nothing, I am saying you are running this whole family. Yes, I am dying here, doing both the engine work and the household work. Hey, what did you get for me? Chitti, I forgot. I will bring it the next time I come. Here, eat this. Go to Venkatsamy and get cheese milk for your brother. No, I will not bring it. Feed him cheese, sweet rice and all. -He isn't thin, he looks like a pig. -Go, get it, son. I have to get everything for him, but he didn't get anything for me. Brother. See this. -Whose are these goggles? -It's yours. What, brother, you never forget what I tell you. You just watch, all of Rangasthalam will... Why is it so dark? -Hey, brother. -Yes? Is it necessary to go out at this time? It's been long since I met Padma. She'll be looking forward to seeing me. Will you hug her once you see her? She is your to-be sister-in-law. God will strike you with blindness. That's why I have goggles to protect me. -Anyway, I can't see what you do. -What did you say? -Hey, you... -Hey, stop, bro. Hey, Chitti. Hey, Chitti, stop. -Padma. -Kumar, come here. When did you come? Just today. How are you, Padma? I'm fine. I brought this for you. Oh, you remembered to bring a gift for your girlfriend. Oh, no, I can't see. You have been listening to the songs from the movie Chitraseema... Oh, no, it's time for my warden to come. I will leave then. Will you come next Saturday? I will surely come, Padma. See you. Why is she crying? -That's what love is. -It makes you cry? Hello, President, sir. -Bring tea for BDO sir. -Okay, sir. BDO sir, what is the matter? I brought the papers for those 40 houses as you said, sir. I even got the bullock cart on subsidy for your ward member, Rangaswamy. What about the road to our fields? I got the concrete road to our fields sanctioned, sir. Here you go, sir. Send word for Nagaraju, that contractor. Okay, sir. Loans have been sanctioned even to these cattle farmers. They are signing the papers. Here. Put it here. If you give these DDs to them with your hands... The tea will get cold, drink it. Sir, these DDs... The president knows what the public needs. Convert those DDs to cash and give it to the clerk. Sir... Yes, we understood. Here, take your bribe and leave now. Greetings. Sir, who will wash the glass? You may be the government's adopted son, but not for Rangasthalam. What is this? Am I a beggar? I am an officer. Will this not change? What's happening here? All your bonds, loans and subsidies disappear. Who can we ask? One president for 30 years. Only a change in power will help. Damn you! Hey, open your eyes at least now. One of you must compete in these elections. What will he do? Will he kill you? That's it? To hell with these dirty lives. You people won't change. What's wrong with him? Tailor Koteswar Rao's son, sir. Looks like he's brought something for you. Hello, sir. Hey, stop your nonsense and kill that snake first. It is eating up my chicks. Move. What are you guys looking at? A snake. You shouldn't look at it for so long, just kill it. Kill it, then. I don't kill on Thursdays, you kill it. I recently gave an offering of milk. I will not kill it. You kill it. My sister is pregnant. I can't kill it. It's a sin. You kill it. Okay, I get it. Chitti Babu! -Chitti Babu, your snake is here. -Where? Is it roaming in the village, too, these days? Where did you go? Dirty rascal, don't you have any sense? You're peeping when a girl's bathing! Don't you have any shame? You came into my bathroom, you dirty idiot. Wow, how beautiful! Why are you staring with your mouth open, dirty idiot? You should go blind. You will fry in hell, you will not be forgiven. Why are you staring? I will pluck your eyes out. You... Bloody idiot. Have your cholesterol levels gone up? Have you gone deaf, rascal? To hell with you, idiot, what work do you have in the ladies' bathroom? Get the hell out of here now! You are so beautiful like a treasure Found you while you were digging the mud for peanuts You are so beautiful You are so beautiful, Lachimi You look like the moon that I saw while cutting tamarind leaves You are so beautiful You are so beautiful, Lachimi You are so beautiful like the marigold in between the jasmines You are beautiful like the yellow thread around the neck of a married woman You are so beautiful like the moonlight on a star-studded sari You are so beautiful like a treasure Found while actually digging the mud for peanuts You are so beautiful, Lachimi You look like the moon that I saw while cutting tamarind leaves You are so beautiful, Lachimi You are a two-legged raindrop who jumped into the river of heart You are so beautiful opening up the bags of tides You are so beautiful, Lachimi You are the lightning with no clouds and walked on the Earth You made me as the sky You are so beautiful, Lachimi You are so beautiful while eating the sugarcane piece You showed the sweetness to the sugarcane How beautiful Like the smile of a mother finding her crying, missing child You are so beautiful, Lachimi You are so beautiful You are so beautiful like the folklore in the palanquin of air And Telugu words in folklore You are so beautiful, Lachimi Hey, Chitti. Feed the calves. Oh, my God. Son, come here. He can't hear anything. Hey, Chitti. He used to hear my voice. Now, nothing. My eardrums will explode! Why is he honking? Chitti, you can hear now, right? How is it that I can hear when you talk softly? Hearing aid, bro. The doctor has given you a hearing aid. You bloody... Only a few knew I'm deaf. Now everyone will know. You put it on. -Go away! -Hey, Chitti. Hey, Chitti. Wait. You are so beautiful, when you are walking on the bund with the pot over the waist And it looks like you've tied the sea around your waist You are so beautiful, Lachimi You are so beautiful when you walk with the bundle of sticks on the head And it appears like you are carrying the forest on your head You are so beautiful, Lachimi You are so beautiful when planting rice in the muddy fields You are so beautiful like giving life to the doll of Earth You are so beautiful like a treasure Found while actually digging the mud for peanuts You are so beautiful, Lachimi You look like the moon that I saw while cutting tamarind leaves You are so beautiful, Lachimi What a beauty. The girl is as beautiful as you were when you were in your teens. When did you see me in my teens? Everyone would flock at my house, really. Your uncle used to feel jealous. I said, your uncle used to feel jealous. You too will feel jealous seeing that girl. What a scolding! When she was scolding me, her words dashed like bullets into my ears. Still, we must agree. She is a great beauty. -Hey, Aunt... -Look, are you Chitti Babu? Are you Chitti Babu? Let go. I have a husband who is in Dubai. It's not that. This is the girl I was talking about. Now she is here, yelling at me. She is not yelling at you, you idiot. She's asking if you're Chitti Babu. Is she? Now watch this. There are four Chitti Babus in the village. Rongali Chitti Babu, Sana Chitti Babu, Engineer Chitti Babu and Deaf Chitti Babu. Remember Engineer Chitti Babu, which is me and I answer only when addressed as Engineer. I also studied till sixth grade. You have to water our fields. Are you free the day after tomorrow? Tomorrow? I'm busy tomorrow, I can consider the day after. Aunt, we should water Venkat Rao's fields tomorrow. Aunt, let me talk about myself. You idiot, that girl asked about the day after only. I understood watering the fields and the rest... Watch how I cover it up. You were right. Tomorrow isn't possible, but day after tomorrow is good. How much would that cost? Is it per hour or per acre? -Again... Aunt, what is she saying? -Hey, stop. What is this romance, closing the door every time? What is happening here? Listen, girl, you'll find there is a lot of secrecy in business. You're that drunkard's daughter? It's not 30 acres, just three acres. He'll start in the morning and complete it by evening. -What do you say? -Yes. I see. Let us see how good he is after starting the engine. -Tell me how much it costs. -Wait... Engine is mine and oil is yours. Fifty rupees an hour and 20 rupees extra for a day. Lunch at noon and a bundle of bidis in between it all. -We will work for this. -Yes. Here's an advance, 50 rupees. Wait... Careful. Hey, what time shall I come on the day after tomorrow? -Hey, Mahesh. -Yes, boss? She's coming. What if she talks and I can't hear? Yes, correct. Do one thing, you pray and I'll take care of this. Can I trust you? I promise on the snake that bit you. Hey, talk softly. Hello, Rama Lakshmi madam. Come on, put it into this. Is there any old oil in the engine? -This is three liters. -He cannot hear. I mean, he'll listen to you after his prayers. -Hey, Mahesh. -Yes? She is so hot, right? You should know that, you have already seen her once. She is coming. You messed up unnecessarily. She is coming now. What will you say? We'll know his greatness now. Hey. What? What are you looking at? What is that look? Look, I cannot hear with the sound of the engine. Talk louder. Boss, you are managing well. What you say that day wasn't enough? That's in the past. Today is a new day. Don't we eat three times a day? Yes, hunger is something you can't escape. I see. You'd think that. You're just his loyal little dog. What? I cannot hear. Are you not ashamed to talk like that? What is your caste? The engine has no caste and religion. It waters any field. This will never dry. Aunt Rangamma said that your dad will be my father-in-law. Considering that, what does that make you? Firstly, what is the relation between you both? Engine sound. Talk louder, I cannot hear. You... -Hey! -Move. Why did you stop it? -He is finished. -Hey, Mahesh. What's your problem? What were you and your aunt talking about then? What were you talking about? About you seeing me the other day? -Hey, Chitti Babu! -Aunt Rangamma! Leave the engine, collect money from Venkat. If you don't catch him now, he'll slip through our fingers. Yes, I am coming. Do you think this is my only work? I have a lot of other work. Let me get a chance, I will see your end. Can't help but look at you. Cover up. You rascal. Chitti. Wait. How is my new shirt? It is amazing! You look like a movie star! -Chitti Babu, money. -He will pay in the morning. -Sir, Rama Lakshmi. -Yeah, I saw her. She's so beautiful. I'll go talk to her. You are unnecessarily messing it up. You cannot hear her if she speaks. She has to pay the money for the engine. I will ask her for the money, she will say, "Okay, here is the money." And, finished. You are finished. Rama Lakshmi, my engine payment. What, you think I would run away without paying you? I've been waiting to pay you for three days. How much is it in total? You were late by an hour in the morning, slept for an hour after lunch, went on Rangamma's work for an hour. Are you enjoying yourself? Wasted an hour as the engine heated up. Minus these hours, and advance, what's the total? She talks too much. What do you know? I should figure it out since I studied till the sixth grade. It comes to 80 rupees in total. Here, take 100 rupees and give me 20 rupees back. I said return 20 rupees. Why are you pinching me? So, that's the calculation. I should take 100 rupees and give 20 rupees back, right? I don't have change. Take it tomorrow. Hey, Chitti Babu. Chitti Babu. What will I buy if you take all of it? I have no money, at least buy bangles for me. I asked for bangles, why are you pinching me? Bangles, right? I will buy them. Come on. Mud, plastic and Singapore bangles. Hello, show bangles for my woman. These will look good on you. How much? -Ten rupees for a dozen. -That's it? -Hey, what's up? -You bloody idiot. Those Singapore bangles cost more. They are 40 rupees per dozen. Hey, I will buy these. No. These are enough. He is flirting with Rama Lakshmi. Sound's great. -Let us mess it up. -If you say so. -Let's go. -These look good. Take them. Look, take 40 rupees and give 60 rupees back. I'll never hesitate to spend for her. What, Chitti Babu, new shirt? Yes, it is. My brother brought it from Dubai. Is it good? What do you mean, "Is it good?" This chick is so hot. You must be loving it. -Right, bro? -That's right. Looking good. Yes, man, Singapore bangles, 40 rupees. Rama Lakshmi, bangles are great. If she falls for bangles, she would hook up for anklets. -Come... -Shirt is great, Chitti Babu. What happened? Rama Lakshmi. Hey, Rama Lakshmi. What happened to her? What's wrong, sir? Why did Rama Lakshmi leave in anger? I think Kasi's brothers passed lewd comments. Is it, boss? It's okay if they did not. I would be a fool if they said something. What to do now, sir? Whether they said something or not, I'll beat them up. That would be best. Will you eat snacks? Tell me, what did you say about my Rama Lakshmi? Chitti Babu, sorry. It was a mistake. That means you said something bad. Speak out, rascals. You spoke bad. Hey, Chitti Babu, why are you hitting my brothers? They teased Rama Lakshmi. -Hey, stop. -Chitti. Stop it! What happened? Brother, they said something bad about Rama Lakshmi. Hey. Stop. What did they say? Tell us, what did you say, guys? Look, if my brothers said something bad, I will beat them myself. If not, will you beat your brother? Chitti, what did they say? Say, man, what are you thinking? What happened? These guys... Rama Lakshmi... Rama Lakshmi... That is... They said something about my Rama Lakshmi. What can he say? Nothing. Hey, Kasi. Because he cannot hear. I'll kill the rascal. You manhandle my brother in front of me, idiot? Hey. Stop, Chitti. Hey, Kasi, listen to me. Hey, Chitti Babu. Chitti Babu. What? My crop just sprouted. I am very happy and want to talk to you. Yes, I am taking this food to the field. No, you hit that fellow yesterday at the fair... I was really impressed. It felt as if you hit them for me. Why did you hit them? You got so angry when I was teased, right? No, see the anger is still the same. Swamiraju's fields? Look, I am talking to the lady here. Can you not see? Go on. -Hey, wait, I am coming. -Hey, stop. What were you saying? So, they are looking for a groom for me at home. Do you have any intention to marry me? If you do, I will talk to my dad tonight. Oh, God, why the hell is she... What happened? My dad's going to look for matches tomorrow morning. Look there, I have so much work. You go give this food at our field. Careful. Right, right. Hold on. Hold on. What is this? This is not Swamiraju's field. Why did you bring me here? -Don't you know where it is? -Hey, come here. Rama Lakshmi spoke something in front of them. Find out. -Hello, clerk, sir. -Yes. A girl just spoke to Chitti Babu, right? What did she say? Oh, that? She asked whether he would marry her. She asked to tell her by tonight. -What is it? -Chitti Babu, Rama Lakshmi wants to marry you. -Really? -Yes. Did you hear it right? Yes, Chitti Babu, it seems Rama Lakshmi asked whether you will marry her and asked you to finalize it by tonight. Now, tell them what they want to know. So, what do you want? Do not make a sound. Be right there. Why did Rama Lakshmi throw down so many things? She is very lazy. Rama Lakshmi? Rama Lakshmi. Do not make a sound. He's sleeping here? Let's leave. She's here? Why did she sleep after calling me? Hey, Rama Lakshmi, come out. Come fast. Why are you here? Rama Lakshmi, you like me? I like you too. A lot. Yes. I mean, there were people from the Society around then and I could not say anything. These feelings were not born just now. I saw you the first time when you were bathing. I liked you very much right then, Lakshmi. Ask your dad to stop looking for matches. You and me... -Chitti Babu, my dad is behind... -No need to say anything else. Let's kiss. Come on. What the heck? I came so quietly. How did they all wake up? Uncle, do you people wake up before the cock crows? Since you're up anyway... Uncle, I like your daughter very much. It's not just me. Lakshmi likes me a lot too. Hey, Lakshmi, tell them. Lakshmi, tell them. Tell them. Tell them that we are in love. Hey, rascal, what work do you have in my house? You want my daughter, idiot? Go, get out. Get out, idiot. Your parents led you astray. -What? -What happened? Why would someone enter the house at midnight? They either come for a chicken or a girl. And there are no chickens in this house. He has definitely come to harm Rama Lakshmi. Come on, let's beat him up. -I'm loud now. -Move, give way. What are you blabbering, rascal? They are in love, he wanted to talk. What's wrong? Why are you all acting as if the world is going to end? You come. As your husband is not in town, it may be okay for you with men coming and going. Come. Why are you all here? Go back to bed. Always poking your noses. What have you done, my baby? Careful, you'll fall! Take care, I said you will fall. Get down. Aunt, I'm really sad. Yes, nephew, once you've fallen in love, things will never be the same again. She hit me so hard. Even my brother never hit me. That short rascal hit me. Maybe she didn't hit you. Maybe she just felt like touching you hard. Hey, definitely not. Like how I switch on the motor in everyone's fields, she's turned on the motor in my eyes. Look how the tears are streaming down. No, do not look at me like that. My husband is in Dubai. I will never let her go. Remember this, Aunt. I will kill her, chop her, put chilis, and squeeze her. Wake me in the morning. What are you doing? What is this? No problem, Aunt, Uncle is in Dubai, right? It's been only 10 days, and I'm getting so stressed. How are you living without Uncle for so many days? My life is like that. Passing by in waiting. Apparently this is love too, your uncle used to say. What is that? Give it here. Uncle looks great. Isn't he handsome? Just like Chiranjeevi. Chiranjeevi, right? I heard this. Why will it not be heard? What is the issue between you and Uncle? What? Have I turned on the motor in your eyes? Aunt... Why did you drink like that, Aunt? -Drink the rest. -Okay, okay. Nothing more is left, Aunt. You drank it all. To hell with you. This is to inform all that, as Matta Somaraju has not repaid the loan taken from the Society, his land is being seized. What, Uncle, are you okay? What is left? It's over. It is all over. The Society people took everything. They used to just take the crop, but now they've taken the land as well. They have taken everything. Nothing else is left but to drown myself in the Godavari. I will rest in her lap. I will jump in and end my life. Very good. Good, carry on, then. Go on! Thank God, I'm saved. Uncle! My engine money, then? I just have 10 rupees. Only 10? Okay, let us look into that later. God gave you a great boon. You cannot listen to the pain of anybody. You are lucky. Aunt Rangamma, Suribabu, Konda Aunt! Come on! Somaraju Uncle jumped into the Godavari! Aunt Rangamma, Uncle jumped into the Godavari! Looks like he swallowed water. Uncle. -He jumped. -Uncle. Brother, look. Uncle. Move aside, let him get some air. Move. Water's out. Uncle is alive. Uncle. Careful. You used to advise everyone. This is not right. The Society took away his land, what can he do? Will they kill everyone? Will the Society not let us live? Uncle, be brave, let us go and ask. What if I had not seen you? Yes, Chitti Babu, you cannot hear at all, right? How did you know that I had jumped in? He is asking how you knew that he jumped. Maybe I didn't hear what you said, Uncle, but I saw the tears in your eyes. I got a feeling and looked back, you jumped. I rushed to save you. I should go water Raju sir's fields. -Careful, Chitti. -You take care, Uncle. Our Chitti Babu may be deaf, but he has a good heart. He is a good guy. Chitti Babu. Hey, Chitti Babu. What? You could see the pain Somaraju's eyes, but not the love in mine? I like you. I'll marry you. I'll ask Dad not to look for any matches. Why are you whispering? Now you know I am deaf. I struggled all this while to manage, talk louder. Love is like that only. this is how it is expressed. Softly. I can't yell just because you can't hear. Why are you just moving your lips, idiot? Talk slowly. -I like you. I will talk like this. -What? Talk slowly, without a sound. I actually... You idiot... Like you... You are useless. I will talk like this. Who would marry you? How could you say that? You are as tiny as a pot and you reject me? I will not marry you. Marry your dad's choice. Go. Hey, Rangamma, Mangamma Hey, Rangamma, Mangamma Rangamma, Mangamma, what a guy he is? He is beside you but he does not care for you Rangamma, Mangamma, what a guy he is? He is beside you but he does not care for you When a grasshopper comes and pinches my nail When a grasshopper comes and pinches my nail When the ant stings and my lips become numb He doesn't even waft on them Even for words' sake he doesn't console me He doesn't even waft on them Even for words' sake he doesn't console me When I am lost in these weird words I apparently bit a chili and am feeling the spice of it He doesn't look and give me at least water to drink And feeling the hotness of it he doesn't look And give me at least water to drink Hey, Rangamma, Mangamma Hey, Rangamma, Mangamma Rangamma, Mangamma, what a guy he is?

He is beside you, but never cares for you Rangamma, Mangamma, what a guy he is? He is beside you, but never cares for you Kumar Babu... -How much did you take, Uncle? -Four thousand rupees. How much did you pay? I have been paying for the last nine crop cycles. How much per crop? No idea, dear. Do you have the receipts? What receipts? Do you think I am mad? I studied till sixth grade and know accounts. How can you seize my crop? -Why are you screaming? -Not that... As per my calculations, my debt has been cleared. My mom sold bangles before dying and cleared the last amount. They say it's not cleared. -I have receipts also. -You have the receipts? We are in the middle of something. I don't like you helping her. Just move away! -I will kill you! -Get that board! How much did you take? Ten thousand rupees. What? Have they seized it all? You deserve it. Did you stop eating because your son died? Looks like you are having trouble repaying your debt. Stop crying. You paid an extra 2,000 rupees. Let's go and ask. Wipe your eyes and go, else Sheshu Naidu will get a bad name. She is crying too much. Hey, Kumar, what brings you here? Mr. Secretary, accounts show that her debt is cleared. But the Society people have seized her crop today. Have a look. Someone steps into Rangasthalam to question us. You are leaving to Dubai. Don't get involved. How can you stay silent when the accounts are wrong? He wants to show off before women. Talk nicely or you'll lose your badge. I am not threatened. Acting like a bank office on inspection, look properly and see how much is owed. The amount was 10, why is it 20 here? -How much did you take? -Only 10,000. If your dad borrowed the money, how would you know? I was with him. And I was the one who counted it. -Let me see that. -Wait. Stop. Stop harassing us! -Give it here. -Don't take Society books. -It's wrong! -Blood! How dare you hit a Society member? This is insulting the president! Let's meet in the village assembly! -Call the police! -We shall go to the president! You guys are taking advantage knowing the president is not in town? Kumar Babu, do you understand the consequences of this? -I will teach you a lesson. -What are you saying to my brother? -Why are you raising your voice? -Chitti, quiet. -Get up. -Ask him to talk properly. Every idiot comes into the house. Rangasthalam has lost systematic decency. Why did you guys stop? Don't show your power to us, show it to them. Your manliness will be known then. Was that not enough? Chitti, stay calm! Be quiet! Promise me that you won't fight. Get him out of here. Your promises are killing me! You come. He is Lord Sri Rama and this fellow is the deaf Lakshmana. Rangasthala Ramayan is great, guys! The President. Hello, sir. What is it, Koteswar Rao? Sir... Is this how you raised them? It's not that, sir. -Wait, son. -Can't you control your sons? My elder son is not like that. As Pallalu's daughter asked for help... Yes, sir. Rama Lakshmi took 10,000 rupees and they wrote 20,000 rupees. Because of the Society, everyone's struggling. Unable to repay the debt, Narasimha's son, Erra Srinu, committed suicide. Just recently... Come here, Somaraju. Somaraju jumped into the Godavari. My brother saved him. -What is my brother saying? -He is saying great things about you. So what are you saying? Are you implying that the Society is fudging the accounts, and that Rama Lakshmi's family has been cheated? Yes, sir. -Hey, Secretary... -Sir? How much has Pallalu taken? He took 20,000 rupees as per the accounts, sir. -Hey, Pallalu. -Sir? -How much have you taken? -Sir, that is... We took 10,000 rupees, sir, I was right there. Hey, you are a girl! What do you know about accounts? No, sir, I studied till sixth grade. Oh, boy. I am laughing now, but explain what happened later. Hey, Pallalu! Sheshu Naidu is talking, listen. -Hey, you. -I'm listening. The president is asking you. How much did you take, 10 or 20 thousand? Speak clearly, you drunk rascal! I took 20,000 rupees, sir. I took 20,000 rupees. Pallalu, you go. Why are you lying? I've been quiet because you were motherless, but you've embarrassed me here. Come home. Why is she leaving? Wait. The issue has been sorted, right? As Kumar hit the Society clerk, so that no one accuses the Society again, please declare the penalty, sir. What's going on? Penalty is 20,000 rupees. Koteswara Rao, pay the money at the Panchayat within two days. Sir, please... How can I bring so much money in such a short time? Do one thing. You have two acres land, right? Sell that and pay. Here, our Raju sir is also ready to buy. -What do you think? -Yes. I will go and bring 10,000 rupees as advance right away. How can we sell that land, sir? My mother worked hard selling milk and bought that land. Was it hard-earned? Then why do the villagers say that the president's father has written it to your mother's name? What nonsense! That is supposed to be true. -Wait... -Let go. What's wrong, Dad? Nothing, they are just asking us to pay a fine. Why should we pay? We won't pay! What? I will bring the papers tomorrow morning, sir. Okay, go now. No matter what you do, we are not going to pay! The show's over. Go home, idiots. We are still unsettled, he wants to save the village. Mom, you should've listened to Dad today. When Sheshu Naidu asked to pay the fine, he said he won't pay. -What do you say, brother? -Yes. You also spoke well. We don't need all these troubles, son. It's fine if we just lost land. But we lost our prestige. What did you cook? Fish curry? Give it here. I will eat some more. Is Dad not hungry? Hey, give me that curry. Otherwise, it'll get wasted. What is the news today, Mahesh? Run the tape. Nothing much today, sir. I met Milk Satyam in the morning. His granddaughter matured, he's invited us for lunch tomorrow. Not that, tell me what happened at the Panchayat today. At the Panchayat? You know what happened. Not that, everyone laughed at Rama Lakshmi. Tell me why they laughed. Oh, that? When the president said, "How would a girl know accounts?" Rama Lakshmi said that she studied up to sixth grade and everyone laughed loudly. Did everyone laugh? They should laugh. She is egoistic just because she studied a bit more than us. Good for her. And after that you know it. Pallalu changed his word and they asked your brother to pay a fine. We denied it. -See you, sir. -Hey, Mahesh, sit down. Sheshu Naidu said something while coming down the steps. What did he say? He said, "Sell your land and pay the fine." And so, my brother asked him to talk with respect? It's your granny's hard-earned land. We're sentimental about it. Anyone would get angry. True, we should be angry. My brother's senses are working properly. What, Chitti Babu, your dad comes daily for paan, why didn't he come today? What do I know? He might not be hungry. He didn't even eat at home. Anyone would lose their appetite because of what Sheshu Naidu said. When we felt bad listening to the words, imagine how your father must've felt. My God, he spoke such filth and that was very wrong. It is time for my TV show. I will leave now. What did Sheshu Naidu say? I told you that, didn't I? What did he say? He said to sell your grandma's land and pay the fine. Think harder. Tell me what you remember. That's all I remember. See you later. Tell me what Sheshu Naidu said? My mother is alone and I have to leave! I will kill you, rascal, tell me what Sheshu Naidu said to my father! Your father disagreed to sell your granny's hard-earned land, and that filthy rascal said, "Is it the hard-earned sale of milk and cow dung? "The president's father gave that to your mother "in return for sexual favors." Your dad felt like he died, sir. I felt horrible about what he said to your father. What he said to your father was not right. Hey, where are you going, Erra Babu? It seems Rattalu's husband is not home and she said she can't sleep alone, I wanted to help her sleep. His work is better than mine. -Who's it? -What did you say about my grandma? -Tell me! -Who? Hey, Erra Babu, catch that fellow! -Hey! -Tell me! How dare you hit me? How dare you say those things about my grandma, rascal? Tell me! Get a hold of him and beat him up! I will not let you get away with it. I will not let you get away with it. Hey, Chitti Babu! What did you say about my grandma? What did you say? If I'd heard it then, I'd have killed you right there. Kill him! Do you think you'll live after hitting me? Kill that idiot! What are you saying? You insulted my grandma? I will kill you! -Grab him! -I'll see who stops me today! Kill that rascal. Where will you go? Hey, Chitti Babu! Hey, Chitti, let him go! Leave him. Hey, Chitti, put it down! He spoke ill of my grandma. I'll kill him! Let me go! How dare he talk about my grandma like that? I will kill this rascal! You unnecessarily hit the president's men, Chitti Babu. We don't need these quarrels. All this is due to Rama Lakshmi. It's all because my brother tried to help her. No matter how much I drink, I can't control my anger towards her. Love is like that, Chitti Babu, it oozes out like toddy as we keep scratching. -She's here. -Hey, Chitti Babu. -What? -Come here! Keep one pail of toddy for me, I will come back soon. What? Why are you not talking to her? What can she do about the deeds of her dad? You rascal, how dare you hit a girl? Don't worry! You think she is just another girl? She embarrassed my brother. She made him look like an idiot at the Panchayat. She is not that innocent. She's used to this. It is her habit to embarrass people in front of everyone. What did you do when I came to your house that night? What did you do? Did you not slap me? Yes, she hits. Her nature is such. Her dad, her dog, her chicken and everyone at her house has that same brain. I don't know what I'll do if you don't take her away. It's not like that! She likes you very much. She has come to say that. -You tell him. -No. -You tell him. -Really? You wait... You tell me... Tell me. -Tell me. -Chitti Babu, I like you very much. -I like you. -Cant hear, louder. Come closer, come on. -Louder! -This is how I talk! See how she yelled this. She speaks loudly to make me look like an idiot, but not about her love for me. Her dirty face, her dirty love, her dirty accent. She has a bad attitude. Don't back her up. Go! Hey, are you Chitti Babu? The SI has summoned you for hitting Sheshu. Come on/ -Hey, Chitti Babu! -Her dad would've called the police. She might be short, but she has great evil ideas. Do not believe her, Aunt. Don't cry. Love is such that it makes you cry. You be careful. Aunt Rangamma, take care of her. -Don't cry, I feel like crying too. -Get in, rascal. Lakshmi, don't worry, I'll be back. How dare you hit the police constable? How arrogant are you? I heard about you! I heard about the ruckus you caused at the village festival. Hitting the president's man... I heard. You are in my station now! I will beat the arrogance out of you. Apologize to the constable. Say sorry. Chitti... -Say sorry. -Sir, do not hit him! -He's my brother. -Say sorry. Sir, he can't hear. Sir, he is my brother. He has a hearing problem. He can only hear if you are loud. Are you deaf? Can't you hear? Who told you that? I can hear very well. I can hear everyone clearly. Both you brothers are trying to make a fool of me? Say sorry, you rascal! -Say sorry! -Sir, don't hit him! -Please, sir, do not hit him! -Throw him inside! Do not even give him water. He will learn if he starves for two days. Sir, listen to me. He will not listen, he is a stubborn guy. Hey, Chitti... Stop it. Our SI is crazy. He will put you inside too. Go. Look, do one thing. Your president knows our SI really well. If he says a word, your job is done. Go. Make him call up by the evening. It's a two-day holiday for the court. -Kittaiah, have you tied the calf? -Excuse me. -Hello, is the president there? -He is sleeping. -Is this the tobacco from Lanka? -I need to see the president. Hello, sir. The police have taken away my brother. They are beating him up. If you say a word, that SI... Sir, please put in a word. If you say one word, that SI will let him go. Have the buttermilk. That's not it, sir. They are beating him up real bad. Have it. Sir... It was wrong to hit Sheshu Naidu, I am apologizing. This will not be repeated. The SI will let him go, if you say one word, sir. "A word for humans, a whip for animals," goes the saying. Animals listen when hit and humans listen when spoken to. Poor fellow, your brother cannot hear even when spoken to. Maybe he'll get some enlightenment after this. Let them hit him, let him enjoy two days there. My brother cannot bear hunger, sir, please say a word. Hey, you know what my name is? -Hey, Umbrella? -Sir? -What is my name? -President, sir. -Bangarraju? -Sir? What is my name? President, sir. Not just these guys, but no one in this village knows my name. -Who is that? -Ammiraju, sir. Have you seen that flag? Be in the line... You know why one single flag is flying in this village? That is not the greatness of a party, but the value my word has. You asked me to put forward a word, right? To say that, my word should have value. Whatever happens in this village, it should happen after informing me. If that does not happen, then it will be like this only. I understood, sir. This will not be repeated, sir. I fear that they may kill him. Please just put in a word, sir. What, are you deaf too? Leave that to me. Anything else? Clean the glass. Hey, your brother has come. Get up. Get up idiot, your brother got you bail. Chitti, careful. Hey, keep it there. Serve it quick... I am very hungry. Open it. Why such a delay to get the bail? I was dying of hunger. Who gives bail when you opposed the president? Hey, give some water quickly. They hit me badly, brother, here... Remember that SI and we shall bash him up later. Okay. -What? -Your brother says okay, sir. And that constable fellow too. We will hit him badly. I will remind you... You eat, sir. He hit me very hard. Brother... Chitti, careful. Why are we here? -Hey, brother. -Hello, sir. What are you doing? You wait. I need a nomination application for the post of president. What is your name? Chelluboina Kumar Babu. -Name of your father? -Koteswara Rao. Which village? Rangasthalam. What happened to him? Nothing. Are you from Rangasthalam? Yes, sir. Are you filing a nomination for the president post? -Hey... -Yes, sir. I've been waiting for this moment for years. Come on, sign. His game is up. Stop looking at the ground, President, sir. Look up for once, a new flag has come to Rangasthalam. Villagers are bored of the same flag and the same president. They want a change now. So, I filed a nomination for president in the elections this time. We came to let you know as a sign of respect. Hair... Yes... My brother cannot hear if it is not loud. But for you... You could not hear as no one spoke out. There are many problems in our village, they have not changed since my childhood. People are being looted in the name of the Society. I know who is behind all that. That is why, the village will not change unless the power changes hands. Brother, I heard this. Shall I speak? Sir, politics have started in Rangasthalam. Get ready for the elections, Mr. Phanindra Bhupathi. Heard this name somewhere? Maybe you forgot, it is your name. See you, Phanindra Bhupathi sir. Let's go, brother. Even the low-class breed is raising their voice, how did they get so much courage, President sir? This courage is not theirs, but of the flag they are carrying. The boys we got bail have come. Come, sit. You did great work, guys. It was my dream for 20 years to have my party flag in your village. A long-time dream. I have never been able to take a step into your village because of that president. He is like the demon, Bakasura, he is eating away the money of the public. I am an MLA for this constituency, but not for Rangasthalam. I did not get even a single vote from your village. Now, I got the confidence. Work hard. You have to work hard. Okay, sir. Your village should develop, right? So ask for any help you need. I will risk even my life for your victory. He is Dr. Murthy and he did the surgery. He has a deep wound on the head. We almost removed all the blood clots, there's nothing more we can do. He is not responding to anything. He has gone into a coma. It is tough for him to live. Why is it tough, Doctor? What tough? He is breathing, right? His heart is also beating and how can you say he will die? He would have died in the accident. You're not God to decide his fate. What, sir, you will live, right? He will live. I heard him say it. You should live, sir. You have to save him. Nothing will happen to you, sir. I will take care. Madam, you understood, please sign on this. What, Madam? What are you doing, Doctor? It's tough now. It's tough now. You know his condition, waiting does no good. So we are taking this decision. What does it mean? You wish to kill him? No, son, we are also feeling sad. But the doctors are saying it's tough? How long more will you struggle? How long more can we let him be like this? Don't say that. That's our fate. I am indebted to him. He will live. I need him, Doctor. Do one thing, just imagine he died and you all leave. In case he lives, I'll bring him to you. Give that to me. Come on, have the curry. I feel sorry for you. You hardly eat and sleep. Why do you work so hard for someone who's not related to you? Go back, get to work. Look, Chitti Babu, what did I say now? Hey, Rama Lakshmi... Wait. Lakshmi... I can't run with you, Lakshmi, stop. Hey, Rama Lakshmi... Hey, Rama Lakshmi, stop. Hey, stop, where will you go? Will you stay the same after your brother wins the elections? What? Won't you leave this stick till you find that snake? Why do you talk loudly? Why not speak softly? Ours is not a love that's eye to eye and whispers. Ours is mouth to ears and loud shouting. Not that, dear, I discovered a system to speak slowly and with love. Sit, I'll tell you. I'll tell you the game plan. Okay, tell me. Now, I'll say, "What's up, Rama Lakshmi?" To that you reply saying, "You only tell me, Chitti Babu." Then I'll say, "Why are your eyes so red?" You'll say, "You were in my dreams all night, I didn't sleep." I'll then say, "If so, give me a kiss, Rama Lakshmi." You should then feel shy and say, "I can't kiss like that." Then I'll hold you tight and kiss you. If we do this, we can show our love even if you talk in a low voice. How intelligent! -Ready? -Yes. -What's up, Rama Lakshmi? -Tell me, Chitti Babu. Why are your eyes so red, dear? I couldn't sleep all night. You were in my dreams. Yeah, then, give me a kiss. Hey... I should kiss you first and you must feel shy, right? Okay, kiss me. -What? -Someone is laughing. Hey, I cannot hear, right? Come on... Hey, you go home. There's someone here, let me check. Right here... Chitti Babu, careful. Powers of the ruling kings are vanquished at this place. The black beads of a tender wife have fallen down at this place. This is the stage where the Evil lord dances along with the ghosts Rangasthalam. No, Ganapathi Uncle... What is that? Did you not die in a train accident? No, have they ended my role like that in Rangasthalam? The same play for the past 30 years. There will be no hero in this play, there would just be a villain called the President. If anybody tries to become the president, his role ends right here in this mud. If elections come to our village, that means someone is going to die! What are you saying? Has your brother filed the nomination? -He wants to be a leader? -Yes. His role too will end. You don't know who they are and from where they will come. They come when Rangasthalam is asleep and end lives. Don't leave, don't leave your brother alone. It'll end, his life will end. Careful, be careful. I had no option, but to file my nomination. -Please understand, Padma. -Don't speak a word. What did you tell me? You said we'll get married and go far away after you get a job. You said we can both live happily. False promises, right? What happened now? Be calm. I do not understand why you did that? Who's there? Who's there? Hey, wait. Who are you? Who are you? Will you tell me or not? Hey... Brother, it's me, Chitti Babu. What are you doing here? I am watching over you to ensure you are safe. What will happen to me? It seems they would kill anyone who contests against the president. Who said so? What? -Who said that? -Hey, quiet. Ganapathi Uncle told me. Go away, you... Hey... Chitti... Chitti, he is a mad fellow. He keeps roaming around singing poems and saying people are murdered, he is nuts. -Mad... He is mad, right? -Yes, Chitti. I had a doubt. That's why I didn't care much. Is it Sound Engineer sir? -The president's becoming more sarcastic. -Thank you. I'll whack you! Both brothers are excited about the nomination and are thinking that he has become the president. Dakshina Murthy has no courage to enter our village and no idea what courage these guys find in him? Sowing is not reaping. Where will they get ward members from? Who would stand against the president? Is there such a man in Rangasthalam? Edukondalu, my brother is running for president. You need to support him. Or I won't water your fields, they will dry up. Chitti, let me talk. No, brother, they should have some fear. -Okay, you talk. -Okay, sit. Malli, give me some pakodas. Are you okay, Uncle? We're just surviving. What is the matter? You know, right? I am contesting for president. I felt it would be good if you are the member for this eighth ward. There is a president in the village. Why do we need another president? Waving a flag is easy, winning elections is not. If nobody is supporting you, it's either out of fear or belief. If it's fear, we can't do much. If it's belief, we should change it. We should make sure everyone knows that the president is behind the Society's crimes. No! You go... Go! -Secretary sir! -Hello, sir. Sir, the checking officers are here. -What? -Officers. -No. -Rongali Chandramma took 10,000 rupees. Chandramma, give it here. Principal amount is 6,000 rupees, sir. Matta Somaraju borrowed 8,000 rupees. Principal is 4,000 rupees, sir. -Kota Ranga has borrowed 6,000 rupees. -Just 3,000 rupees, sir. Chikkam Narasamma has taken 12,000 rupees. -Narasamma? -I only took 6,000 rupees, sir. My son committed suicide because we couldn't pay the debt. Look, Officer, this is the situation. Has it become a habit to take bribes? What is this fraud? Did you understand that the Society is looting us? That's what happened in Lakshmi's case. They cheated and made her father lie. This is the president's act. Sheshu Naidu is a puppet. Our village is looted in his name. You look up to him as though he's a god. Has the village changed during his rule or have our lives improved? I filed the nomination to contest the post of president for your sake. Support me and file nominations as ward members. My nomination will be of no use if none of you come forward. Think about it. Stop thinking, give your nominations as ward members. President has started prayers, come on. One moment, listen to me. Somaraju, Narasimha... Where are you going? Hey, Ranga, wait! The village is hostile because of their deeds. No one is talking to us. Why are we bothered about what no one cares about? -Chinni. -Give it here. -Get lost! -Give me some water. Do we have any properties or what? What, son, have you asked everyone? Your sister has to get married. -No one is ready. -What's your plan? You should ask all friends and even enemies in times like this. -Don't hesitate. -He won't stop, even if they do. Chitti, come. Like father, like sons. See you, Mom. -Where are you going? -Don't worry, Mom. Wait... Are you going to ask him? We will make fools of ourselves. -Not that, Chitti. -Come. Look, listen to me. Do you have brains? Let's go. Okay... You be here. I will talk to him. -What's wrong with you? -Take care. He'll do the needful. Why are you worried? Hello, Kasi. How are you? -Listen carefully. -You wait. Tell me tonight. Okay, I will. Kasi, you know that I am running for president, right? No one is coming forward as ward members. All are running away in fear, you know why am I doing all this, right? Kasi, with one guy like you the whole village will come forward. That's why, Kasi, I came to ask if you will file a nomination as a ward member. Should he file a nomination as ward member for you? You're shameless to ask. What is Kasi's brother yelling at my brother? -Listen. -I'm listening. Did you forget the fight? I'm not staying calm now. Say no and send him away. -Go. Go. -Hey, wait! Kumar Babu, I will support you. Brother, what are you saying? Till this day, they hit us and we hit them back. But is there any man who hit the president's guy? Chitti Babu has done it. Why is Kasi pointing at me? He gave his brother the courage to file a nomination today. Still, is he doing all this for his good? He is doing this for our village. -Hey... -Hey, be quiet, guys. It is a waste if we do not support him now. Kumar Babu, I am with you. I'll do whatever you say. Tell me what to do. He's moving his hands and talking, listen to him. Sir, it's you who cannot hear, I can hear from here. This is enough, Kasi. Come on, Kumar Babu. I'll break his finger. No, your brother is looking at me angrily. Tell him, or he'll hit me. Come with me. Chitti, Kasi has agreed to support us. What? First tell him what I said about him. We fought among ourselves, but none dared to hit the president's men. Your brother is great having done that. -Is it? -Yes. You're a great man. If you are on our side, we can convince the whole village. We won't look back now. Oppose the president? Will you be on that shore, Naganna? Or will you come onto this shore? Will you be on that shore, Naganna? Or will you come onto this shore? Will you be on that shore, Naganna? Or will you come onto this shore? Will you be on that shore, Naganna? Or will you come onto this shore? There is bottle full of arrack Pot full of toddy and so much brandy on that shore There is a tumbler full of buttermilk on this shore Will you be on that shore, Naganna? Or will you come onto this shore? Will you be on that shore, Naganna? Or will you come onto this shore? -Chitti, Rama Lakshmi left. -What? Rama Lakshmi left. Will you be on that heap, Naganna? Or will you come onto this heap? Will you be on that heap, Naganna? Or will you come onto this heap? There is batch of wolves, group of foxes and gang of bandicoots on that heap There is a herd of cows on this heap Will you be on that heap, Naganna? Or will you come onto this heap?

Or will you come onto this doorstep? Will you be on that doorstep, Naganna? Or will you come onto this doorstep? Have it, son. Already giving sweets to the bridegroom? My dad is holding a bottle of poison, what do I do? -Get up! -Chitti Babu! Stop eating, get up. What are you doing? -She is mine! -Take your hands off! Take your hands off! You are the reason they are afraid of you. You are opposing the president. The village would boycott them. You can't earn your livelihood to take care of her. Okay, do one thing. I will somehow request the president and get money. Tell your brother to take back his nomination. And then I‘ll get you married to her. No need to delay it, I'll pay now, take her now. Yes, take it. Take the money, at least you get better. So, you too have joined hands in the president's politics. I don't need this money or her. Get her married to anyone you want. But vote for my brother. Will you be on that side, Naganna? Or will you come to this side? Will you be on that side, Naganna? Or will you come to this side? There is justice, law, our own side And that side... There is the opposite of all that on that side That means? Injustice, unlawful and not our own So... Will you be on that shore, Naganna? Or will you come onto this shore? Will you be on that side, Naganna? Or will you come to this side? Come on, Aunt, sign here. Aunt... Kumar Babu... I'll contest as a ward member. Hey, come on. Bring the chair. Please be seated. Put it here. Hey, Rangamma... Come out. When everyone supported my brother in the evening, why did you turn your face and go away? Yes, your husband is in Dubai and sends dirhams every month and you sit here getting ready. You have any debt or pain from the Society? -You... -Come inside. From tomorrow, I'll address you like how everyone else in the village does. I am telling you to come in. I am asking you to come in. Why are you closing the door? Are you going to hit me? My brother will not lose just with your single vote, I am behind my brother. What, fish curry again? I quit eating fish. I'll not eat your fish at all. -I don't need your engine and your fish. -Eat. I'll not eat. Don't overact, just eat. Okay, tell me this first. Why didn't you sign in the evening? You can't hear a soft voice, how can I explain my pain to you? What? Did you ask me before filing a nomination? Who needs permission to do a good thing? We just filed, that's it. And that makes you heroes here? You think no one opposed the president until today? Remember Erra Sreenu? -I know. -How did he die? Jumped into the river. Why, can't he swim? How did Abbulu die? He consumed pesticide. Why were stab wounds present on him? There were stab wounds? Do you know how a strong swimmer can drown in a canal? When he opposes the president. Come on. Eat. Even your uncle was just like your brother. They are misusing Panchayat funds. The Society account books are different from the originals. He said power should change. Your uncle wanted to file a nomination on returning from Dubai. I will file a nomination in the next elections and see your end. He returned from Dubai. Your uncle is not in Dubai. They killed him. This is your uncle's watch, and that's why I told you to wear it the other day. This watch looks good on you, wear it. Aunt, why didn't you say before? This is a beauty, right? If they know that my husband is dead, every guy will take advantage. All murders in the village might be different, but the reason is the same. Opposing the president. Your uncle, Abbulu, Erra Sreenu, Venkat Rao... They did not die naturally, they were murdered. Do you want your brother to suffer the same fate? He killed them only when they wanted to file a nomination. Your brother has filed the nomination. Will he stay quiet? President, sir... We know that it is you looting all our houses, plots and ruining our crops. I will contest in the next elections and ensure you will lose. I know all this is because of the power! Authorities are looting in the name of the Society! I will file a nomination for the president this time! Do what you can! Has your brother filed a nomination? He wishes to become a leader? His role, too, would come to an end. Now tell, do you want your brother to suffer the same fate? Villagers of Rangasthalam... Welcome our leader, a hope for the poor, MLA Dakshina Murthy. Tie those banners higher. Brother, you take care of those. Kasi, take care of all these. There, tie it to that pillar. There comes the leader who gave food, clothes and shelter to us. Have a look. Hail Dakshina Murthy sir. There he comes... Hail Dakshina Murthy sir. -Hello, sir... -Hello. Sri Sri says, you cannot find a place without war on this whole Earth. This is not Rangasthalam, but a war zone. There's fear of what may happen, a fear of what happens if we oppose. Fear to be born, to die, to breathe here. Which village are you from? Why are you here? Move. People, God decides death anywhere. Sell your knives in the village. Go away. But Society decides the death in this village. Kumar is the first to file a nomination against the president in Rangasthalam. He is the courage of this village. To get rid of the fear in you, and for your lives to change, you all should unite and make Kumar Babu win the elections. He is educated, a thoughtful person wishing to do good for the village. You should all support him. Hey, who are you? What is in that bag? Sir... Sir... Hey, Chitti. Listen to me. Are you mad? He is my man. He got me coffee. He is your brother, right? -Yes. -Why did he hit him? He's afraid I'd be harmed. Move aside. How can the people be brave if you're afraid? -Not that, sir. -You come, move. Please forgive him, sir. It's okay, no problem. It's not like that. What's wrong? I thought he had a knife. No, brother, I thought he was taking out a knife from the bag. Kasi, you take care of the election canvasing from now. We are not together anymore. -No... -Do you understand? Hey, where is your brother? Hey, did you hear me? Did you cook my favorites or his favorites? Yes, you cooked what he likes. It's okay. Here. You always come together, right? But now, he's a big president and he'll have many obligations. Who cares where he goes? He does his work and I do mine. So that is the issue. Go to Kasi's house first and look for him. He would be taking part in discussions there. Okay. Hey, Kitti. No peace since elections. Did you see my elder one? Oh, God. This headache is killing me. I should never drink again. Boss is right here, getting ready. Everyone pestered me the whole night. Village work in the morning and spends all night in town with God knows who. -Sir is now the presidential candidate. -See you, brother. He's out of our reach now. -Hey, Chitti. -If he is like this now, in the future... Careful, dear. Boss, all ward members are going to take back their nominations. Good. It's all over. Let's get back to engine works. We spoke yesterday. They are going in a tractor. Move. -What exactly happened? -No idea, sir. What happened, Kasi? What's there? We are going to take back the nominations. Tell me why? Everyone in the village knows, man. You don't have to act in front us. I am asking what that drama is? Both brothers have cheated us greatly. How will I know if you don't tell? Nothing, Kumar. Whole village is saying that your brother has taken money from the president. Got it? Now start the vehicle. Hey, wait. Don't be in a haste without knowing the truth. I'll ask Chitti myself. If my brother is wrong, I will also come with you and withdraw my nomination. -Go away, we won't come. -I'm requesting. Wait, guys. Come on, let's go. Mom, serve me food. Add some chilis, too. Hey, Chitti... Chitti... Did you take money? Hey, I am asking you. Why would I take? Mom, give me some food. Hey, why don't you answer your brother? Can't you hear? I already said. He may be the president, but I'm suffering. Chitti, look into my eyes and tell me. Did you take the money? What are you saying? Why would he take it? Mom, give me one more onion. -Stop, brother. Listen. -Did you take it or not? -Hey, Kumar... Wait. -You wait. Did you take the money? You'll be hurt. I'll cut myself if you don't answer me. Listen to me, I'll tell you later. Did you take it or not? I will tell you later. Listen, you'll get hurt. Did you take it? Tell me! Hey, I took the money. I took it! Yes, I took it. I took it. -Mom, apply turmeric. -People just started believing us. You have made us all look like idiots. He is bleeding, go and get turmeric. Go and bring turmeric. It doesn't matter. You have deestroyed him. No, Mom. No, Dad. I feared they might harm him. Get out of the house. What? Get out of the house, you deaf rascal. President, sir, here is your money. I don't know how much was in this. There won't be any difference because I buried it right there in your compound. I thought ward members would go back if I take this money, and that my brother will take back his nomination. Why is he like that? He put a knife to his throat and threatened to kill himself. I was terrified looking at him. I don't need this money. Still, I feel very proud of my brother. He is doing so much for the village. How much more should I do for such a guy? I will do, sir. I will. I will do for sure. Yes, I forgot. The whole village is saying that the president does so much worship and he has great powers and those powers will kill anybody who opposes him. I mean those people. Abbulu, Venkat Rao, Erra Sreenu... They say all these people died the same way. President, sir... You only should know if they are true or not. You are a great man. If what they say is true by any chance, please let your powers know one thing. Kumar Babu has a brother named Chitti Babu. To get to Kumar, they have to go through Chitti first. Also let them know that they cannot cross him and go, okay? Hey, the president has heard everything I said. You continue. See you, sir. Chitti Babu, who's going to wash the glass? Sister, you bless her. Hey, move. Wow, what, Uncle? They have made her the bride. Why are you here? So beautiful. -Get out. -Hey... Hold this... Hey, Rama Lakshmi, you look beautiful in this bridal attire. Will any idiot let go of such a beautiful girl? This Chitti Babu is letting her go. Get out. Even after telling Chitti Babu so many times that I want Rama Lakshmi, these ears are not willing to listen. Do you know why? I like you, but I like my brother more than you. What am I supposed to do? Do you know why I am crying? Not because you are getting married. My brother put the knife to his throat and said he will kill himself. I am crying for that. But this bothers me the most, I left you for my brother. And can you not let go of your father for me? I am telling you now, when you have as much love for me as I have for my brother, let me know on that day. I will not leave anyone. I will come myself, take you and marry you. Move aside. Stop crying. If this marriage stops, your father will drink poison and die. You will not die with a small tin, drink from this big bottle and die. What are those papers? It's the voters list, sir. We never saw it earlier, since we were unanimous all these days. Scrutiny is done and we shall get ready for the elections. Politics has changed in Rangasthalam. It looks like the village will have a new president. Till date we've killed Venkat Rao, Abbulu, Rangamma's husband and even Erra Sreenu's son of our servant, Edukonadalu, who opposed us. But we erred in the case of Kumar by being quiet. Why do you cry? Even that God is like us, he keeps taking the right guy. I didn't know that you were that God, sir. I didn't know. I didn't know. I am sorry, sir. I did not notice him. What can we do now, sir? The whole village is on Kumar Babu's side. Plus the support of Dakshina Murthy. A day to call you by name has come, sir. My advice is, it's better to quit than to lose. Sorry, sir. It was a mistake. Sir, it was a mistake. -What, rascal? -I am sorry, sir. Hey, Edukondalu, we returned the president's money. Do you know? Of course you'd know. The whole village knows it, except the people in my house. The tall rascal heard it. Hey, stop the drama and come in. Why will I come in? I also have an ego. -Chitti is back. -Others are okay, but Father called me a deaf rascal and asked me to get out. He shouted loud enough for me to hear. Do you know how sad I was? Stop your stupid drama. Come and eat. Hello, Kanthamma madam, my hunger died long back because of what your husband said to me. I don't need your food. My food is here. Come, you came at the right time. Look, her name is Rama Lakshmi, and she's my fiancée. She cooks better than you. I am going. This is my portion. My grandma gave it in writing. Come on, sit. What did you cook? Lentil curry. She says it's buttermilk curry. What else is there? Eggplant curry. Eggplant curry? My mouth is watering even without opening the box. Come, Mom. Lakshmi, serve me the food. I'm very hungry. Yes, serve. Sister-in-law, can I have some curry? -Okay, you're my sister, right? Have it. -And for me? Okay. You're my brother. Serve some for me too, dear. I'll have some, too. Wait. Koteswar Rao sir, I am deaf already, please talk a bit louder. Okay, man. You serve, dear. Bring one plate for her. We both will have from the same plate. Open your mouth. -Great pair. -Chitti Babu! Sir, we got the Lantern symbol! Let whole of Rangasthalam dazzle with lights. I am going. I'll come later. -You go, brother. -Lakshmi, this one time... Thanks, dear. I am coming! Let's go. Dear villagers of Rangasthalam, the Dazzling Queen has come to dazzle all your eyes. Get ready. Hey, Dazzling Queen, come on. Oh, no. Are there so many Dazzle Kings in your village? Why would there not be? They came from neighboring villages knowing that you are coming. Listen, why is that Dazzle King in the floral shirt staring at me with his mouth wide open? Hoping to get something from you, our queen. Hey you, checked shirt, why are you coming onto me? Look, none of you push each other. I'll come to you all and give whatever you ask for. Yes!

Have you come to cut sugarcane at Buchi Naidu's fields? Yes, sir. We had cut half and another half is pending. They cut that four days back, right? Not this, sir, but the piece on the other side. Is it? Oh, man! Left the song at its peak. Hey, Mahesh. -They know about me. -How, sir? -They are speaking loudly to me. -Yes, sir.

Shall I light your pyre with this hand? Are the legs showing us paths Into the burning wood? Will the hands patting on our shoulders turn into ashes? Are the eyes dreaming for us burnt and black? Has the voice waking us up gone into deep sleep? You were a support to console when we were in trouble It would have been nice if you were there to console us in our grief now Oh, my dear Oh, my dear I drove away the evil sight with this hand and I consoled you with this hand I taught you to walk with this hand and sent you to school with this hand Shall I send you to the graveyard with this same hand?

Maybe you have bid a goodbye to us But our sinful ears could not listen to that Oh, my dear Oh, my dear On the north side of the village, near the big tree. Black smoke would come. Vengama Sattayya, you tell me the route. He wanted to say something, Aunt, but I couldn't hear. I am a deaf idiot. You are searching for the snake which has a human head. Careful, he is ready to hiss. Careful, he is on the north side. He is watching your way from the south. He is breathing in the grass bushes. Foxes are safeguarding him. Excuse me, how do we go to Achanta Venkat Rao's house? Can you say it a bit louder, I cannot hear you. How do we get to Achanta Venkat Rao's house? Go ahead and take the fourth lane. In the by-elections for the Sarpanch of Rangasthalam Village Panchayat, Kolli Rangamma, wife of Late Ramprasad is elected unanimously, and we declare the same as per the election code.

I want to see Dakshina Murthy sir once. -Wait, I will tell. -Just once... Hail Minister sir. Have it, Lakshmi. Sir, just once... Madam. I want to meet Dakshina Murthy sir. Hey, prepare the food. All our people are arriving. -You drink. -Okay? Venkanna, make food arrangements, come quickly. Madam. -Why are you here? -Hello, Madam. -I need to talk to sir. -Why are you here? Come in. You wait here. The house is getting dirty. He's upstairs, Chitti Babu. Why are you sending everyone in? Hey, take all these out. -Hello, sir. -Hey, Chitti Babu. How are you? I am fine. How are you? I'm very well. He served me for two years. -I owe him. -Hello. I won over death. I will live for 100 years. -Good, sir. -Sit. I just got a call from High Command. My name is in the list of ministers. It is all because of you and I am drinking to celebrate that. Tell me, what can I do and what do you need? Sir, I need to talk to you about something. My whole life is yours. Come on, tell me. Sir... Can you please go outside? Hey, close the doors. Yes, tell me. Sir, what is this? Don't drink. Sir, your health should be fine. I prayed to Goddess Gangalamma for your health and brought the offering. Please take it. What, man, why do you show so much affection for me? By the way, how is your village? Very good, sir. As my brother wished, the village is very good, sir. I heard about your brother and felt very bad. Finally, was the president found? We searched a lot, we searched everywhere to kill him, but somehow he escaped. I went to a soothsayer. With her directions, we searched for him. North of village, big tree, black smoke. He's on the north side. Watching from south, breathing in grass bushes. Foxes safeguarding him. -I killed him. -You killed him? Yes! He was wrong. Erra Sreenu, Abbulu, Venkat Rao and Rangamma's husband. The guy who killed so many people, killing him was the right thing to do. It is justified. He has to be killed. But you killing my brother is not justified, sir. Hey, what are you talking about? Why would I kill your brother? I also do not understand why you had to kill my brother. He said something while dying. I am a deaf rascal, sir. So I could not hear properly what he said. I was never worried that I cannot hear, sir. But, for the first time I felt very bad thinking why God has given me this deficiency. But that same God has shown me another way out. The song played in celebration and what my brother said before dying was the same. Srimannarayana... Srimannarayana... Srimannarayana. Srimannarayana. Srimannarayana! Luckily, there is no Srimannarayana in our village. We are all children of Mother Gangalamma, sir! But I've heard that name somewhere. It is tough to put words into Chitti Babu's ears, but once it goes in, it stays stamped there. Yes, for once, I heard that from you, sir. Srimannarayana... Srimannarayana... He is my man. He got me coffee. Srimannarayana is your man. He said it all before dying. Why did you kill my brother? Who asked you to kill? Speak! Why did you kill my brother? Tell me! My brother was in love with your younger daughter, right? I'll go to the hostel, Dad. Here. -Come home this Saturday at least. -Okay. Will you kill for being in love? Srimannarayana... It is so terrible, sir. You gave me bail without any relation, made my brother file a nomination, murdered him and blamed the president. You took a life, sir. Will anyone stay quiet instead of killing? You bloody rascals. Your brother doesn't even have the right to enter my house, and he has dreamt of stepping into my daughter's bedroom, is it? You and your life are worth nothing! Now you are talking, sir. This is your true self. Yes! Can you hear, you deaf idiot? Why did you save me after knowing that I killed him? I was coming to kill you after I got to know that you killed him, but the lorry had hit you by then. When you were in a dying condition, it was me who took you to the hospital. I served you a lot, sir. I cleaned your body, I washed your clothes. I even cleaned your bedpan with these hands. While shaving your beard, my hand used to shiver like this. Shivering... Like this... I thought I'd kill you right then, but you know why I kept you alive? You should know why you are dying, you should know my pain. My brother told me, sir. Even the criminal pronounced with a death sentence will not be hung if he has a slight fever. When he develops a desire to live and when he gets healthy, that is when they hang the criminal. See... Now you see. Now you really want to live. Now you also have a chance to be a minister. So, it is justified to kill now, right? Just wait. Do you remember him? My brother. For killing my brother, Chelluboina Kumar Babu of Rangasthalam village, his brother, Chelluboina Chitti Babu, is now going to kill you. Do you understand now, sir? Sir, now you understand well.
