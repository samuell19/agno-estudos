“I bequeath nothing for I have nothing” Juan de Unzueta, my eighth-generation ancestor on my mother's side, left it thus written in his will before he died in 1765, that he bequeathed nothing to his descendants, for he had nothing. It is the family’s oldest testimony to have survived to this day. Thanks. Hey, what about me! Address? Eh, to the… What's it called? To the port. Yes, the port where the cruise ships land. Fantasia. Fantasia. It's 19.95. Ah, 19. - Hang on, I have it. - Have you got it? No, I haven't. What is it? Following wind, which is from behind. Stern and bows. It says 10 and 12, and that makes 22. Look, that's the equipment and our suitcases. Are they ours? I don't think they're ours. Well, I can see mine… there. Bashed. That's my suitcase. - That's it exactly, my case. - Yes, it is. And the blue and grey one is ours, yes. Wait, let the ladies go by. Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to demonstrate how to put on your life jackets correctly. It's much prettier close up. Super close-ups. Look, see? It's really pretty like that. The belt must be fastened tightly. Please, don't use the whistles, thank you! I love hearing piano music. Look, point to the moon. No, no, you Mummy, you. Eh? You've got your back to me, so I can't see you. It must be like an effect. There, see? Oh, Iñaki, look. Can you see it? So cool. Wow! Aitor, Amaia, come here! Here's everything. Because I'm an infallible husband, but not tireless. Oh, what's this… Wait a minute, just a minute, please. Do you know what? You should do it more like that. You put in whatever you like and your coffee always tastes delicious. I prefer when you prepare it directly, but the right way, the right way. Not too milky or too black. Hello. Hello. Clean yourself. You look like the supplies service in a seven-star hotel. It’s way too much. The fridge is open, everything. I'm doing what you haven't done, Kontxita. What? Putting things away. Look, look. When I came I told you: put everything away. And you didn't do it, of course. - I was cleaning everything. - Of course, sure, yeah. Look, it doesn't fit. Look, this must be it. Put it on this side. Okay then. Action stations. Well indeed, with the two of us you bring so much stuff as if you had a country hotel… Good morning, family. How's things? I've heard two of the three messages I've got. It's a beautiful sunny day here, fabulous, very nice. So it's not a showery April. Love your poem, Mum and I think it's a great idea: to read a poem a day, it's brilliant. I know you're just about ready, Aitor is… He sent me a message a minute ago, that he's already on the way home. Damn. You'll be saying now: “Oh, oh, son''. So, I'm really jealous. But I can take it. About the earthquake, it has nothing to do with the volcanoes, it's not the volcanoes. It's the Nazca fault, the South American fault which runs down the coast and it goes as far as… All along the Andes, the whole range up to North America, although they call it something else there. Well anyway, that was the earthquake. The panorama is awful. If we were already in a crisis, I don't even want to think about the crisis we're in now. Here in Quito we felt it, of course, but we are all perfectly okay, nothing has happened here, okay? Just so you'll know, because tomorrow you'll start to hear things. Well, goodbye. This one faces east, this one faces west, and this one is pointing at me. A little bit crooked. This one, terrible. This one, okay. The thumbs… That one a little, this one a lot… Look, but this one is okay. Still. You can't die until it happens, right? - The two full ones, those are okay. - Yes. These three are okay, right? Then you have a watercolour here. This is all black. That's annoying, isn't it? It's all going black. Does that mean I’m going to hell? Yes, I expect so. Really. You were very mean. I wish I had been mean. Look at this, see? Well, my hands are like a pianist's. I can't even straighten them. Look, Mummy, how these hands open, eh? These three are normal, aren't they? This one is a bit of a rascal. Yes, that one is a separatist. - Eh? - It's a separatist. This one is bad. Not this one, it's a unionist because it wants to go under there. These two, they're fine. These three are fine too, aren't they? Yes, but this one wants to go away. - This one wants to be alone. - It wants to go away. And this one too. This one wants to go away too, but in the other direction. Pro-independence, that's what they are. And this one, what does this one want to do? To be inside this one? How funny, isn't it? It seems strange, right? - They say that nature is wise. - What? They say that nature is wise. Yes, very wise. It's stupid. When it wants to be. I often look at this painting of my granny and grandad. Grandad Iñaki worked as a mechanic in a garage. He loved to play the piano, and when he was young he learned tap dancing. I remember his strong hairy hands so well, playing the piano in the apartment in San Sebastián where he lived with my granny. Years ago, Dad commissioned this painting of his parents based on an old photo. To me, the handkerchief she gives him represents their love from which Dad, my sister Amaia and I came into the world. This other painting that is also based on an old photo has always been in the house. Our other grandad, Mum’s father, was called Patxi. I don’t have any memories of him; he died in an accident when he was working on the truck, a year before Amaia was born. Since we were little, our mother talks about him a lot. Every time she does, this is the image of my grandad that comes into my head, of a figure walking away, taking his mystery in the wineskin he carries on his shoulder. Uncle... Miguel. Right. - You have to put it. - There. From left to right, Grandad Patxi. As long you put Grandad Patxi… Were they friends? Damn it! They're all my uncles and cousins. - Well then, tell me who they are. - That's what I'm telling you. - Don't raise your voice. - From left to right. I'm working for you, right? - So don't be… - From left to right. Okay, yes. Who? Grandad, I said. Patxi. I've already got him. Grandad Patxi is there. Cousin Miguelito. - Cousin? Whose cousin is he? - Mine. And his brothers, right? They're not brothers. This is my father's nephew. This one and this one are nephews and these are uncles. Don't bang the computer, there's no need. Finished. Oh, really. Well. And now what, Aitor? What? No, wait, sit down, wait. Sit down a minute where you were. No, no, we've finished. It's such a shame, we talk so little you and I, but we quarrel a lot. Come on. There are 200 photos in the memory, each one should have a different name. Well, you'll have to make up something, you have to make up words or put “zz”. Put ''Camellia''. And the next one, ''camel''? But why? Hey, Aitor, are you filming Dad without his teeth? - No, Aitor... - No, but wait... No, I'm not in a fit state. But what's wrong? I only wanted you to explain what you're doing? What? I just wanted you to explain what you're doing? Nothing, just arguing. No, but… Don't be cheeky, he's filming. Well, he shouldn't film then. Okay, I'll stop then, so there. Oh, what a nuisance… I'm not in the mood now for filming. Sorry, sorry. This idiot always says: ''We're always either sulking or kissing''. Well, that's the way we've been all our lives. He never says sorry, until I just get bored and let it go. And then I forget and we start again. And him too, I suppose. But I'm the one who's offended. I think that going to the bed to give her a hug is enough of an apology. The day before yesterday, she rejected me. Okay then. He came, a little bit more, but very cynical too. No, no, no. And I've told him a thousand times. I've already told him… It's just a matter of saying: Go over what you did and then say, were you okay? Or were you mean? He just doesn't want to do it. When there's a conflict, when anything happens, usually we men the only thing we hear are accusations. And when I speak to Mum she has a hard disk and she remembers from the first time we went out together to Urgull.. And I don't. So she talks, and talks and talks and in the end… That's when I remember this one, the other one, the other one… I mean it's not because… Resentful... I mean, I get over it, it goes away and then it's as I'm the cherub… and the seraphim… Like something beatified, beautiful and wonderful. If she wants to get over it, she'll get over it, and if not, she'll stay like that. Well then… Forced celibacy. I'm going to be kind, I'm going to be doing… We'll go here and there, But I won't… And I can certainly tell you, I won't get intimate with him, I don't feel like it. In any case, before I should have to say sorry she should say sorry for having spoken to you when she said she wouldn't. When we both agreed that you were not going to notice anything during these holidays. I know you don't feel like talking at all, but… What day is today? Christmas eve. And apart from Christmas eve, what day is today? The day of the crime. For me, today is New Year's Eve, Aitor. Looking forward to the New Year with the same enthusiasm that I lived last year. Cool. And are we not celebrating anything else? Nothing. There's nothing to celebrate. What about 47 years ago? We got married. Exactly, that's why there's nothing to celebrate. In your mother's opinion. He was the first to say something. Just for the record. Oh no, I forgot it was your anniversary! What a scatterbrain.. Congratulations! Let's see, how many years is it? I need to get out the calculator… It must be 48 years because I'm 46. Well, you seem to be going splendidly, full steam ahead. Congratulations, Dad, Mom! Good morning. Dad! We were up very late last night and didn't get much sleep. No particular reason, you know? Very late. What do you mean “no particular reason”? - But did you get passionate? No way, not at all. We were very correct, for God's sake. Reading, and that's all. But the worst thing is that I couldn't sleep afterwards. After taking the pill, nothing else. We left everything in its place. And I said: wait until the tiger wakes up. But no, he stayed asleep. Hey, but you were very well-behaved, right? What happened, you both woke up? - Yes. - Yes. And you didn't sleep well? Yes, and Aitor said: let's go and see Mum and Dad. And they were so delightful. Look, they’re just like tourists, so good-looking, Dad… I want a white coffee. I'm going to go in. Can I go now? Yes, you can enter. - Good morning! - Good morning! Look at the little girl and boy, so elegant. Our little girl. Dad without his teeth. Dad! - What with not seeing and long sightedness… - Hey, did you have a shower? - Wow, you smell lovely. - Yes, we had a shower and everything. Oh, look at the children, for goodness sake. What a body, what a body. Oh! So elegant, so flexible. Aitor, I don't think you'll be capable of leaving your mother en déshabillée. - No. - That's right. - The camera shouldn't be so indiscreet. - No, it will only suggest, which is more erotic. For goodness sake, no. Not even that. Not even that. Do this and look at the camera. And smile. Do this and look at the camera. And smile. Say cheers and look. When he tells us? Action! Bravo! You, Amaia, give me directions, hurry. Well, quietly. Faster, faster. Faster, faster, faster. Hey! Go up and… No, no. Amaia! Where are they going? Up or down? Fuck! - Now they are… - Come on, yes. Make a terrifying entrance. A terrifying entrance. Scary, it must be scary. That's great. Yes, who is this? Really. Oh, how nice. She's so pretty too. She was a beautiful woman. Beautiful, slim, elegant. Yes, yes, I have lots of photos. I'm glad. Because you know she gave me plenty of photos, of uncle and her. And yes, I have pretty ones. Yes, yes. When is the funeral? In San Ignacio, as always, isn't it? Seven in the evening in San Ignacio, okay. Okay, goodbye. She died. Aunt Mari, what a pity. What a pity. This morning I was talking about her and look. What a shame. - Iñaki. - Your cousin, isn't it? Aunt Mari has died. The one who was 102? She was 104 years old. - Shit. - They say she had a stroke… Elisa was telling me she had had a bad winter. But she lived a long life. - What? - But she lived a long life. Yes, but that period has definitively gone now. - The only one who was left... - Of that generation no one is left. Of my father's generation, it was Aunt Mari. And that's all. She's gone. - There's nothing left. - Nothing more. Well, the cousins. Yes, the cousins, but my Dad's generation, it was Aunt Mari. Now, the only one left is my mother. The only one, of that generation, is granny. Imagine that. Crazy. Well, that's it. Hello. It's Sunday here. We're making a bonfire at Annie's place. And we're singing with the guitar. With such sadness we see a loved one is leaving us… It's a piece of the soul… torn out without mercy… It's a piece of the soul… torn out without mercy… Don't give them anymore. The one I do remember is Mum’s mother, Granny Puri. She looked after the family, though sometimes she worked cleaning floors to bring in some money. When she died, Amaia and I were small, but when I look at these photos I can remember the loving tone of her voice perfectly. Here, Mum’s family: Up there, Granny Puri and Grandad Patxi. It's one of the few photos there are of him. Thanks to that photo I at least know what his face looked like. Below are Uncle Andrés, Mum, and Uncle Félix. The one on the right is the eldest of the brothers, Uncle Pako. He was a truck driver, just like Grandad Patxi. Since he was my godfather, I got my middle name from him. He died nine years ago. Here, Dad’s family: from right to left, Granny Ino, Grandad Iñaki, Dad and Aunt Maribel, who takes care of Granny now. Uncle Pablo hadn’t been born yet. Now, he’s about to retire. This is the photo the painting in the living room is based on. I’d say it was posed, as if they had chosen the setting and composition. This is the photo the painting of Grandad Patxi is based on. Clearly, he wasn’t posing; as the photographer took the photo, he just kept walking. In any case, I suppose when they had their photo taken, they didn’t imagine that one day their children would choose these photos and commission two paintings, and that a grandchild, who wasn’t even a speck of dust floating in space, would look at them one day in 2020 the way I am doing now. Look at Mum. She was very beautiful, wasn't she? Shit! This is Amaia, isn't it? Or you? It's Amaia, of course, because you didn't touch your hair like that, did you? - Yes, I did, I touched my hair too. - Really? This one, this one… it's Amaia, I think, because this is Salamanca and you were never in Salamanca. No. And that belly? Who is the girl? Shit… - Amaia, isn't it? - I get really confused. Amaia. - Yes. Is this Amaia too? - Of course. Shit, with no bikini top? This is Granny Puri. Granny? Yes. And this is Amaia too, then. Mum has mixed things up. Well, now I'm looking at this one. We're going to scan it and it will stay here.. What's wrong, Mum? It's chilly and I went out without my jacket. Mum with her fur coat, the one at the wedding. This is you when you were a tiny baby. Look at you drooling. Well, well. Aitor, careful, look after this for me. Come on, now let me, I've got lots of work to do. I mean that things don't get done by themselves. Isn't that right, Txurrito? What, dear? What? Darling. Hello pretty baby. Come here, don't go away, silly. Dad is coming. Oh, God. Let's see. - Oh, good, very good, isn't it? - Very good. Very good. Shit, the bird has crapped. A piece of paper. I feel so clumsy, I'm not strong enough to walk. Let's see… - As they say… - Where was it? - Where was the bird? - On your head. - Eh? - On your head. But, where did it crap? No, it didn't crap anywhere. - Yes. - How do you know? Because I saw it, but I don't remember. She would have heard it. Oh… No, no way. Oh, yes. Look, here. Can you see? She would have heard it, Aitor. Colombia, the capital? Bogotá. Why? Just to know because you know them all. Argentina? Buenos Aires. Uruguay? Montevideo, my mother was there with Grandad Pedro. - That's right. - He was such a good person. He really loved me. And I wasn't his blood. He completely adored me grandfather did. - I know, yeah. - He adored me. Paraguay? Paraguay, capital: Asunción. - Ecuador? - Quito. - Brazil? - Rio de Janeiro. - Honduras? - “Tegucipalca”. Tegucigalpa. - Well, whatever. - Almost. Cuba? Havana. Allá en La Habana, allá en La Habana… I've forgotten it. Poland? “Warsar”. Warsaw. - England? - London. - France? - Paris. - Germany? - Berlin. - ¿Austria? - Viena. - ¿Holland? - The Hague. Ah. Then they called it Amsterdam, but before it was called The Hague. Same as Brazil, which was Rio de Janeiro before, and now it's Brasilia. - Oh, well, of course, but I… - They changed it, but you learned it when it was Rio de Janeiro. - Anyway, I liked it more the other way. - Of course. Belgium? Holland. - No. - What? Belgium? Oh! Mummy! - Belgium. - Holland, capital? - Holland, what capital? - The Hague. And Belgium? Oh! I've forgotten. Good, hooray. At last, one that she doesn't know. Oh, I can't remember. Bru…se… - Brussels. - Of course. - Ah! Belgium, capital: Brussels. - Of course. You really knew it. It just slipped. You're very beautiful, Mum. Really? Thanks, son. That's because you see me with the eyes of the heart. How lovely. This one, let's see... Where was it? In my wallet. - In your wallet. - Ah, you've already got a photo. - Yes, I already took one. - You already have one, right? That one is repeated. And this one, who is it? In this one he is very good looking. Yes. Keep that one. Give it to me. Shoot, he was good looking … Damn! And he was a very good person. Very good, very good. Grandad Iñaki died of Alzheimer’s. He was diagnosed soon after retiring. Little by little, he forgot how to play the piano and the tap dancing steps. One day Granny saw him shaving his tongue. There came a time when he didn’t recognise his own reflection in the mirror. In the end, it was hard for us to recognise him too, as if by losing his memory, Grandad was no longer himself. At the end of his life, Grandad forgot who he was, but it’s been thirty years since he died and we still remember him; he’s in the painting in the living room receiving the handkerchief that Granny is giving him, with hands that aren’t yet wrinkled or fingers that haven’t become ''separatist'' because of arthritis. You were quite good looking… Well, it's been years and years since I was like that. I can imagine. With the pregnancies, you usually… Let's turn over, 1, 2, 3. Let's turn, okay? On your side. That's it. Have you bandaged my legs? - Yes, of course, yes. - The leg, yes. Yoo, hoo! Well, how are you all over there? Mummy will be back home by now… I know that Aitor is going to be there to spend Christmas from the 20th. Hey, I'm really jealous. This is the last time I spend it away, I'm fed up. Anyway, what can I do living so far away. I miss you all, and Mum loads, and the others too. And I love you. Goodbye. Over there. There, there, there. How funny! They'll come over here because they like it. Now I can't find them over here. Ah! I can see them over there again. They are going to accompany us... Look over there. Two, three… Over there, further away, Aitor. Yes, yes, yes. I'm filming them. Pretend it's like a heavy metal guitar. Oh, I'm going to fall. And, wait, do it like that, Dad, with your hands like this. And now, shake your head. - Goodbye. - Bye. Oh, my bag. The bag, daughter, the bag. My jacket. - Hey, my jacket. - And mine? It's here, don't lose it. Aitor, a kiss. Well, goodbye. - Goodbye. - See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Mom, so you'll call us when you wake up, okay? - Yes. - Okay. Why will we call you? - So we can annoy you. - Ah, yes. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I saw an eyelash he didn't have before. The shadow of an eyelash. Of the eyelash. It makes an angle. And voilà, it makes a shadow, like that, straight. But, then, it's… It looks a bit strange now. Apart from that fact that I always end up crying, every time I see him. I don't know if it looks good. Well… Give me a kiss, Mummy. A kiss. It's unsettling. Seeing him and… And then this time it seems that it's going to work out. You know what. I find him more difficult than Mum. And I found it difficult to do Mum. But, it's just that Paco… Besides, as it's more recent… And each time he saw me he started crying like a child. Félix too. But well, this one… He was totally childish, and helpless and everything else you can think of. Poor thing, he seemed… And he's here looking so well. It's amazing. After all the times I've quarrelled with it after the stroke… I've recovered partially, but, my left side doesn't work well, I can't coordinate this hand with this one, I can't play the guitar. And of course, I haven't picked up the guitar for nearly three years. Because why would I pick it up if it makes me feel miserable. Instead of finding pleasure, you find pain because you want to do the things you did before, even though I was never brilliant, but at least I played more or less clearly, more or less in time. And if I had the accompaniment recorded, well it sounded like a street band but good. But it's just that now… And after the stroke, I didn't recover, even though I tried really hard… I struggled, three or four hours a day you needn't think that I was I threw myself into it because I couldn't go for walks, I couldn't do anything that interested me. And the guitar, I rediscovered my instinct, but the moment came when I saw it was useless. I even had a private teacher and he showed me what I already knew. I knew how to do it, but I wasn't able to do it. I'm seeing like a sort of coin. Wait, wait. I thought it was a coin. But we fell because of it. Because we were meant to. Hey, come on. It's fabulous. And now it's the dolphin. The dolphin. Let me get on. All aboard! The island. What a chubby whale you are. It's amazing! I'll go with you. SOS Navarra, good morning. - Good morning. - Hello. I'm calling from García Ximénez, because of my husband. I'm not well either, but above all it's my husband… What's wrong with him? He has a shocking cold. He's had it for three days, and he's not getting better, and he's 72 years old and he's already had a heart attack, in other words, he's a patient at risk. All right, what's the man's name? I'm going to pass you on to the doctor. What's your husband's name? Pedro Ignacio Merino Mozo. Well… See you soon, Daddy, we're going to pick you up now. We're going now. - What will we do, we'll both go, right? - Of course. We were at home, I went to the room, and I said ''Maribel, it's Txurri''. I don't know if I said, ''I think he's dead, or asleep''. He was dead. We don't know why it happened. He died. We're not going to have any more, what for? Txurrito, damn. Do you know how much fun he was? But it's a pity to get another one because the same thing will happen. What does it say there? Ah! Take... Pills... Ah, take the pills. But I don't… I'm just getting worse, how am I going to go? How many is it … 94 years. I'd like to see you like this, as old as I am. But with health, without pain, like me. I mean, I have aches and pains, the usual, but I feel very well. Damn. My head hurts. But I'm bound to have something. My head is in good shape, my memory is relatively good. If I owe 10 euros, I remember that I have to pay them. If they ask me, if not… That's that. He looks after everything himself, this one. The sugar. - Ah! We haven't … - Yes. - Was it 116 today? - Yes. Then, hold on a little so as not to pull the tape. That's it. Hold it a little here and you can lift the bandage, it'll pull your hairs, but that's all. And once it's unstuck, just pull from here and that's it. Christmas Night celebration together with father and mother. Hello! Damn, what news I just got, mother. Daddy has pneumonia, light, but pneumonia… Shoot. Well it seems as if you're both about the same because Mum is hoarse, very hoarse… Lucky about yesterday, since we were out from morning until almost evening out on the land and there's no signal, I came home and, to be honest, I didn't even put the battery in my mobile so I didn't find out about anything. I'm saying just as well, because I would have been more worried… So Daddy is on oxygen, fuck. Well, well, well… I'm glad you're a little better. In any case, as you well know, I would love to be there to look after you a little. Oh dear, oh dear. And it must be terribly cold. Well, I'm sending you a kiss. And keep me up to date about how you are, okay? All right then, goodbye. What? Well when Dad and Mum got out of the swimming pool, Dad looked really old, very alone, and absent-minded. He was holding on to everything. He picked up a can that was on the ground, he left it and then he went over to Mum to dry her face, and he dried it very gently. So sweet... It made me feel really fond of them, because nobody was looking at them and we weren't even filming, then they were just looking at each other like that for a while. Too much. That's right. And right now I was thinking, while I was watching them, that maybe, well for sure, that we'll remember these days a lot. Of course we will. Yes. Well then, enjoy it and that's all. Yes, that's what we're doing, but… But that's it. It's not sadness, it's feelings. Yes, yes, yes. Look, look, I'm going to film them. - Come on. - Let's go. The man stuck to the camera. It must be Mum who is calling, and calling and calling. Okay, okay. Very well. Well, it's only 10 o'clock in the morning and I'm in pyjamas. I just haven't had time. Ten in the morning… I'm going to have breakfast. Yes. It's five in the evening, what a lie. You know that every day I usually get well dressed, although… Well, Mrs.Tatters. Well then, Amaia, the idea is… You'll be staying here for how long? Well the idea is to stay for a year, but that's just what I'm thinking. I'll go away… I don't know, - On holidays.. - … at the end of next year. To Ecuador. But, in any case, I think that now.. I don't know. I don't think about it. I don't think about whether I'm staying here, or if I'm going to stay over there or if I'm going to be somewhere else, the only thing I do is live, period. It's your turn to do this. And that's it. And I'm happier than a bug in a rug. That's it. Because it's wonderful... - You bet. - ...to be here. Very easy too. Really cool. And at home. With Mum and Dad. All of 50, well 47 years old. - Happier than a bug in a rug. - With the parents. Dad, Mum. Lots of days she comes up and throws herself at us. So maybe she's gone out to do a message or something. And she comes back in despair, like saying. Oh, it's been so long since I saw you! And she acts as if she were a baby. Very good, daughter, that's what I like. I'm a mother again. I've just had a baby girl. Eight, nine, and ten! Eleven! No! Ten, eleven… And twelve! Now that's right! Happy New Year! Happy New Year. - Aitor, dear. - Happy New Year Aitor. - Granny, grandad. - Grandad. - Happy New Year! - With Granny I got on well, but I got on very well with Grandad, me with Grandad, and since he's no longer here. Because if they put out two glasses you drank them both. Because he didn't drink, right? Grandad? Yes, he drank a little, yes. Yes. So, you like it, don't you? The present from the children. After 50 years, plus the two or three we were dating. Yes. Imagine, that's when we had just got engaged. Mum was really pretty then, wasn't she? What? Well, darling tiger, give me one of thoses kisses. One of those kisses? Very fancy. - I am very fancy? - Very fancy. You look so much like Amaia, or Amaia looks like you. Yes. Cool. Well then, Let's eat, no time to waste. And what about me? Was I not good looking? - Yes, but not so much. - I wasn't good looking? - What? - Was I not a fine young man? Fine young man… No. I liked you for sure, but, you weren't the type of lad that young girls liked. I liked you, because I'm special, but girls don't tend to like the chubby guys. And you were chubby. A little, not much. Just a little chubby. I loved you. Just the way you were, chubby, like now. - Well, come one, let's eat. - Come on. So, who is it, Granny? That is Pedro Ignacio. And who is Pedro Ignacio? Our… Your uncle. Iñaki. Our father! Your father's name is Pedro Ignacio. Oh. Then, who is this? Our father, isn't it? Well of course. - What a mix up! - Oh! Don't confuse me now. Say, your father. Your father. - That's it. - All right. But sometimes I still call him Pedro Ignacio. - Of course. - I haven't lost the habit. Okay. Let's see. I don't know him. What do you mean? Who is it? Pedro Ignacio. Well I don't know him. Really, granny? That's when he was playing music. Can't you see he has an instrument? He looks strange. - Does he? - He's clean shaven. No beard. - He has no beard. - No beard. Now it begins to ring a bell, but not much. That's odd. This lad has changed so much, Mother of God. My goodness. This must be so old. I look really strange, don't I? Strange? My eyes are closed, right? Who else is there? I look like someone else. Well, you look younger. Shit. My husband is so cocky, so striking. Like a tough guy. We were very young. Very good, very good. So many changes. We were good looking then. Aunt Maribel has been looking after her all her life. She stays in Uncle Pablo's in the summer. She could come here for a few months, if she wants and auntie agrees, right? No Amaia, Dad mightn't want her to come here. Well I don't understand Dad. What has it got to do, with being an example for us, really. Well, by example I mean that, I don't oblige or force you to behave with me in a way I didn't behave with her. I mean, morally you will have the freedom to choose my fate, the universal one. No, simply, I know that, Mum and grandmother would kill each other in just a few days. - Well, I don't… - And the way to stop them killing each other would be for me to go away. I don't want anything to do with this, because I don't agree, and I don't feel like it. Well, he asked my opinion. I know, but I don't want that. Because that's an excuse that he's giving. - I'm saying, - Well, talk about yourself. That granny can come home. Mum is thinking about this. I've been saying it to him for some time. And if I get angry with her or if she gets angry with me, then we'll make it up. It doesn't matter. The one who doesn't want it, is you. I just don't see myself living with her, I can't. It's more than I can bear. I put up with her for an hour and a half every day, and the half hour journey to see her, but it's an obligation and that's enough for me. In that short time I've had enough time to argue with her several times, and she stands me up at the bar. No, Granny and I have never got on. And that can't be solved or avoided, it just gets worse. Well, that's your position, - That is my position. - … and your idea. Well in fact, I've lived with granny all my life and I haven't had any rows, as far as I know. Quite the opposite, I got on wonderfully with her. The thing is that now she is .. Different, strange, and she's always… And what if Aunt Maribel couldn't be with her, because she got ill, for example, and Uncle Pablo too? Well, if aunt… That probably won't happen… But if not… But imagine something happens, whatever it may be. Well I don't know, I don't think it's the worst that could happen, if Granny came. It wouldn't be the worst. Then, so it's on the record, what are the four of us doing here? We're on a trip… You can say it from... ''The four of us are here, because we are doing…''. Well we are on a trip, paid for by you, because in the end this money we're spending is not ours. It's your future. I mean, you've made a good investment and we're very grateful. Because we are spending the inheritance, aren't we? - Yes. - Ah. Very good. And you Aitor, of this trip, what…? - That doesn't count, it doesn't count. - The same question. No, that doesn't count. The same question for Aitor. Damn. Well for me… I don't know, enjoy it. It's that… Let me, I prefer filming them, Amaia. - It's just they've asked you. - Okay, yes, fine. Wait, wait. No, I'm saying... What I enjoy about this trip is, is being with you all, with Amaia, the four of us. Of course, that's perfect. And also because, who knows how long you will be around, to be honest. You are getting older and we are too. And we don't have children, and we should enjoy it. Because it's not going to last forever. This is what we have learnt, that we are all still okay, although… The four of us are fine. That said… There's no list with an order as to who goes and who comes. The four of us are very well and I thought it was a great idea to do it. Anything else? Yes, what do you most fear? Of the future, specifically. Ah. Well. Me, nothing. I'm afraid I could get cramps like the other day, it was awful. But well, you don't think about it. Health. Death and things like that, you don't think about it. When it comes, it'll come. Come on, you know that… I think about my mother dying and that I'll be very upset. And I'll also feel a bit free, at the same time. And for the others, the same thing will happen, because when you get very old, very old… It's different. You change, your character too. Let's see if we can get old with good humour. Well the only thing for me, you know, I've told you more than once, is: If my head is okay. And I am, knowing… For me, the acid test is: If I know you two, then everything is fine. But if I don't know you, why would I want to live? - And what do you want them to do? - I mean that, by then, - Stop looking at you? - No. I trust there will be laws that… There won't be, Kontxita. - Protocols of… - There won't be. There won't be? Well there should be. If you have signed and said, like, for example, what I'm saying now. What I'm saying is: If I'm in the world and I don't know you, I don't want to be here. Let's see granny's glasses. So cute. I can't see anything. They're like children's glasses. Well I'm going to wear them. The thing is I have lots of glasses now. Of course, and you need to get them adapted. Sure. - These glasses looked great on her. - When you get your eyes tested… - I'll change. You can change then and put them on. - For reading or whatever. - Yes, and this? You brought it from... I think from Istanbul. From Istanbul. Of course. It doesn't say so. Ah yes, Istanbul, because it's… The river... - I don't remember the name. - The other glasses, Amaia. They're so pretty. They look good on you. A bit small, aren't they? It had everything… You put it on like that, - and you can see it has… - Yes, yes. They're for a baby, I mean a girl. Yes, but in fact she could see fairly well. She could see fairly well. She could see any stains on you. - On your face. - What have you got there? What have you got there? What have you got there? - Yes, yes, she could see very well. - She could see very well. Damn, granny was something. Upon his death in 1765, our ancestor Juan de Unzueta did not bequeath anything because he had nothing to give. He was poor, but if it wasn’t for him, Mom, Amaia and I wouldn’t exist. On the other hand, I feel lucky: I will be able to bequeath this portrait, although I don’t know exactly to whom. If it lasts until the year 2775, maybe there will be someone who knows about Mum and Dad, the bird and Granny, Amaia and I, and even that distant ancestor without whom none of this would have happened. Because, what is the purpose of a portrait if there is no one left to remember you when they see it? How's it looking? Fine, fine. It's so pretty. We'll have to ask them, right? Pili? We'll have to ask, yes. Hey. - Let's take this. - Yes. No, give it to me, I'll take it. Here, take this one, Aitor. Take it, Amaia. Eat it up, it's very good. Hey. That's it. I want some wine. Have we got the spoons? - Have you set the forks, Amaia? - Yes, Mum, I've set them. But here there are only... - They are in the salad. - Ah, here there are two, three, yes. - And water too. - And the napkins, except for Dad's. I've prepared this one. That's it. - I don't want wine now. - I'll get water, ok, Aitor? Yes. Water, wine. Dad, look I'm going to show you the peppers, how I've organised it. Whatever way is fine for me. I've put some packets with half a kilo. Yes. And others with three quarters. And the full ones, here below. - Lower down. - Yes. - What are the full ones? - A kilo. Like the ones we had before. No. The kilo ones. You told me to keep the new ones. And the ones that were already there already in packets and frozen, where are they? Down below. Down below. That's what I was asking. Done. Now you only have a wife, you haven't got a mummy. Hey, and a daughter! That's true. But she is a descendant. I am a conspirator. And son! Convergent! No, sorry, you are a conspirator. - You also have a son, don't you? - I do. Oh, and we left the little one out. - No. - And camera. - And camera. - And camera. My litter and my camera. - Come on let's have dinner. - Yes, I came for this. You've already had dinner, haven't you? I'm going to honour you with my presence. Very well. But will you be able to withstand the temptation? I will, I will. - Can you turn a light off over there? - Yes. La tentazione.
