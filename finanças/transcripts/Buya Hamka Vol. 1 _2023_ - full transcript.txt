JAILHOUSE SUKABUMI, 1964 Buya. - Buya Hamka. - I seek forgiveness from Allah. Your wife came to visit. Ummi... Ummi, Father is here. As Allah willed it. Ummi... You finally came. Sorry for taking so long. How are you? - Praise be to Allah. - Praise be to Allah. - Father. - Zaki. Father. Father. Take the paper in the back of my waist. Rus. - How are you? - Fine. Praise be to Allah. Here you go, Engku. I made you some snapper head stew. - As Allah willed it. - Eat up. That's how tears work. They doesn't choose a place to fall... nor a time. That's salty enough. It'll be too salty if you add your tears. Tears are salty... because they're the salt of life. Without them, life has no flavor. Eat up, Engku Hajj. The salt is from my sweat while I was cooking it. Father. I seek forgiveness from Allah. Let's eat. In the name of Allah. - Thank you, Ummi. - You're welcome, Engku. You type like a man possessed, Engku Hajj. Instead of a smile, your frown even reaches your forehead. Still not done with the congress report? Meeting a lot of ulama... makes me anxious, Ummi. Why so, Engku? Most of them never realize how much the times have changed. They deny new knowledge. Some even try to hold back progress by labeling others as infidels. Every tiny thing they don't like would be labeled as haram or infidel. How are we supposed to spread Akidah Tauhid if we are that ignorant? So content with our own thinking? Wouldn't it be useless to force others to change, Engku? What should I do then, Ummi? Make yourself as an example to them... as you did to me. Fighting every day to uphold the true Tauhid spirit. I seek forgiveness from Allah. This Hayati character that I wrote in my novel... she looks a lot like you. Her face looks even more beautiful under glimmering light. I want Ummi to be the first person to read it when I'm done. You tell me if the characters are romantic enough. You don't need to do that. What do I know about romance? You're the expert. It's your turn to pray now. You prayed very solemnly. I pray that one day we'll have enough money to buy another prayer rug. So we can pray together. You are far more romantic than I am, Ummi. After last congress... Makassar's Muhammadiyah has grown rapidly. Now, we have four branches and 39 groups. We also see extraordinary growth in education. We have built 103 Volkschool, 47 Standaardschool, 69 Hollands Inlandsche School, and 25 Schakelschool. Therefore, we need to raise awareness on the importance of education in our society. It is the duty of all Muslim men and women to seek learning, from cradle to grave. Education is mandatory for Muslims. From the cradle to the grave. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Excuse me, Ustad. - May I help you, sir? Ustad, this is my daughter, Ola. Ustad, if I may, I would like to hand my daughter to you. What do you mean? She is ready to become your second wife, Ustad. Wait a minute. Where did I put my bag? I seek forgiveness from Allah. Maybe it's still in the office. I will be right back. - You look like you're in a hurry. - I have to go for a while. Please keep my bag. It's under the table. I will get it later. - Yes, Ustad. - Thank you. Praise be to Allah. Ustad! Oh, no. Here's your bag. As Allah willed it. Where did you find this, Ola? It was under the table. I forgot about this. Thank you. Do I look ugly, Ustad? Ugly? No, not at all. Then why did you run? Didn't surah An-Nisa tell us that you can have more than one wife? Up to three, even four. But there's more verse after that. "If you're not sure whether you can act just, then one is enough for you." You should understand, that it's not easy to act just to more than one woman. I am sure you can be just. I seek forgiveness from Allah. Allah is The Most Just of All, Ola. I'm just a human being. No guarantee I would be just forever. You should know that a husband's injustice to his wife will leave a bad impression on the children about their father. I understand this must be your parents' wish. Don't you worry about this, Ola. I will talk to them, and other potential suitors about this. - Thank you, Ustad. - You're welcome. I'll take my leave then. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Here you go, Engku. Old people play with beanpoles. And divide the beanpole by eight. Coffee comes to calm my soul. Started off bitter, yet sweet as dates. Thank you, Ummi. In the name of Allah. Ummi. My manuscript is almost complete. Have you decided on the title? Under the Protection of Ka'bah. As Allah willed it. Check this out, Ummi. Have you ever thought of returning to Medan? They still need me here, Ummi. Why didn't you tell me? That you received an offer to be the head for Pedoman Masyarakat magazine? This magazine is still brand new. It's not enough to provide for our family. Just like in here. The Muhammadiyah organization here is already settled. Why should you spend more time here? Father. Hisyam can't sleep. What's the matter, Hisyam? You had a bad dream? I'm here. Your Ummi is also here. Go back to sleep, okay? I will sleep with you later. In the name of Allah. I just can't. I don't want to be separated from you and the kids. I understand. But Pedoman Masyarakat magazine can be a new field of worship for you. You can spread the teachings of Akidah Tauhid. For the ummah and other religious leaders. But what about you? Allah has shown the way to you. You don't have to worry anymore. While you are in Medan... me and the kids can live in Padang Panjang. - Thank you. - Please take our token of gratitude. For all your help to advance the Muhammadiyah in Makassar. Please accept it. As Allah willed it. This is amazing. - May Allah reward you with goodness. - And you too. - I will take my leave. - Take care, Ustad. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Ma'am. Ustad! Yes, ma'am? - I brought something for you. - What is this? This is for you to eat on the ship. Praise be to Allah. May Allah reward you with goodness. This is my wife, Raham. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. I want to say thank you. Ustad's advice has been well received by Ola's father. Ola is now allowed to continue to study at the Muhammadiyah. Praise be to Allah. - I want to be a teacher, Ustad. - That is wonderful. Glory be to Allah. We should be leaving now. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. A teacher, plus she's pretty. Having a teacher as a wife would be really good. She can teach her kids properly. You are right, Ummi. That's why I'm happy having you as my wife. You are a great mother and teacher to our children. In the name of Allah. Hisyam's afraid to board the ship, Father. Don't worry, Hisyam. Me and your mother will always protect you. This magazine has to be the amplifier of truth for the people. Through this Pedoman Masyarakat, we will voice modern thinking... PEDOMAN MASYARAKAT OFFICE MEDAN, 1936 ...with a strong Islamic and cultural foundation. There is no Melayu without Islam. Without Islam, Melayu loses its "me." It will be "layu," or wither. Minangkabau, without Islam, will lose its "Minang," leaving only "kabau"... a buffalo. If we work with the spirit of Tauhid, if Allah wills it, this magazine can be the true reference and guide for the lives of the people to properly live in the Islamic way. If it's just to live for the sake of living, pigs in forests also live. And if it's just about working... then monkeys also work. UNDER THE PROTECTION OF KA'BAH PADANG PANJANG WEST SUMATRA To Ummi, whom this beautiful stories flow from. So please accept this gift just as I promised. Send my hugs and kisses to our children. I hope you and the children will always be under Allah's protection. PEDOMAN MASYARAKAT EDITORIAL - Ummi. - Yes, Dear? Where's Father? He's still working. You need to rest, Hisyam. We will visit the physician tomorrow. If Allah wills it, you will get better soon. Have patience. There's no God but Allah... There's no God but Allah... And Muhammad is His messenger. And Muhammad is His messenger. There's no God but Allah... There's no God (but Allah)... Hisyam... Hisyam! Hisyam... Hisyam! Hisyam! Your magazine content is a hot topic among Islamic figures in Java. Praise be to Allah. Thank you. Anything else? Buya, there's a telegram from your wife. Thank you. We belong to Allah, and to Allah we shall return. What happened, Buya? We have prepared a cart to take you home... No need. - I won't be going home. - Why, Buya? Today is the day we print. I have to supervise until morning. But... Even if I return home right now... Hisyam will already be buried. You just focus on completing the articles today. I still need to check the columns. Allah is The Greatest. Stop here. Thank you. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Ummi. Forgive me. I couldn't come home. Hisyam understood... what his father is fighting for in Medan. It is the will of Allah. Allah just loves our son. He loves Hisyam so much. Ummi! Father! Come here, Zaki. Fear has plagued the Dutchmen. We hear Sutan Sjahrir and Mohammad Hatta moved from political prison in Boven Digeol, Papua to Banda Neira. And Sukarno has been moved from Flores to Bengkulu. Grab all the equipment and documents that instigate the masses. One more inciting article from you people and we will shut this place down for good! We congratulate the movement of this nation's leaders. Nationalists who will never give up voicing out Indonesia's freedom. Well done, Buya. Our magazine sold 5,000 copies today. Number one in the whole Dutch East Indies, Buya. Praise be to Allah. One of the cruelest things in life is letting a brilliant mind become a slave to a lazy body who puts rest before fatigue. Well done to all of you too. You have worked very hard. Thank you so much, Buya. All right now. Remember, don't be too happy just yet. Our fight is still far from over. CONGRESS PREPARATION EAST SUMATRA Dear brothers, blessed administrators of East Sumatra's Muhammadiyah. Expand your mind and your life will expand as well... and your happiness too shall come. Why is that? Because people with thinking minds tend to get themselves closer to Allah. Because they can see the beauty and the complexity of Allah's creation and thus will submit to Allah's will. Faith, for people with thinking minds, will keep all forms of evil away such as hypocrisy, grudge, injustice, treachery, lies, greed, and so on. With faith and charity, people with thinking minds will have lives that are more brilliant. In Islam, ignorance is a slavery that is more ruthless than any kind of slavery! Don't forget about our next meeting. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Malik. Karta? As Allah willed it. - Malik. - As Allah willed it, Karta. - I should call you Buya Hamka now. - Come in, come in. Let's just talk out here, it's cooler. Come on. Are you well? I'm fine. Praise be to Allah. Finally I can meet you. - Have you married? - I have, praise be to Allah. And you? How many children do you have? Allah entrusts me with four children. - Praise be to Allah. - Praise be to Allah. As Allah willed it, it's been more than ten years since we last saw each other. Yeah. Time flashes just like lightning. It still feels like just yesterday that we boarded that ship, got tossed around, had fun during the full moon. Right. And now I see you're the great leader of the Muhammadiyah in East Sumatra. I heard you're now also an administrator in West Java's Muhammadiyah? Well, I don't mean to brag about it. And you're wearing this fancy suit? Glory be to Allah. What if people call you infidel? No! Why should I be afraid? I was inspired by your writings in Pedoman Masyarakat. There is no need to claim haram for something that isn't, right? If Allah wills it. As long as I am istiqamah, pray for me. That's the Hajj Sukarta I knew. By the way, other than attending the congress, I've come to bring you news about Kulsum. - Kulsum? - Yes, do you still remember her? The beautiful lady with a red scarf aboard the ship heading towards the sunset. She passed away. We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return. She couldn't stand her husband who keeps marrying every women around. She committed suicide. Poor woman. If only that time she... There is no "what if," Karta. Allah has laid the best path for us. There is no "what if." Right. I seek forgiveness from Allah. In the name of Allah. THE SINKING OF VAN DER WIJCK (1) BY H.A.M.K. AMRULLAH THE SINKING OF VAN DER WIJCK (16) BY H.A.M.K. AMRULLAH "'My life is only for one soul, Hayati!'" "'So is mine, Zain!'" "A few minutes later, she opened her eyes." "She motioned for Zainuddin to approach her." "When he was next to her, she whispered to him." "'Recite the two holy sentences into my ears.'" My God. "Zainuddin recited the syahadat three times." "First he recited it with his tongue, and then with his eyes, and the third one..." - Hayati. - She's gone. Hayati... Ummi. Thank you. PUBLISHING DEPARTMENT BALAI PUSTAKA JAKARTA THE SINKING OF VAN DER WIJCK Thank you, Allah. Glory be to Allah. THE SINKING OF VAN DER WIJCK Everyone. You should read these books by Malik to expand your knowledge about Islam and about Minang culture. - Thanks, Uncle. - What is this about? It's The Sinking of Van Der Wijck. It's a great read. Where? Let me see. - Thank you, Ummi. - You are welcome, Engku. What are you writing now, you flirty Kyai? What if someone told you... the chairman of East Sumatra Muhammadiyah wrote love stories that make women cry? And make young girls dream that someday a man like Zainuddin will come into their life? What would you say to people who mock me like that, Ummi? Why should I bother answering them? People who mock you surely never finished reading The Sinking of Van Der Wijck. They only judge before learning about the truth. And if they actually completed it, yet still think of me as a bad kyai? A flirty, or even a perverted kyai? What would you say to them? I would say... that da'wah does not always have to be delivered through lecture or speech in a mosque. Through beautiful and heartwarming stories surely da'wah can be even more effective. As Allah willed it. In the name of Allah. So what novel are you writing now? This is not a novel... MODERN TASAWUF ...but a religious Interpretation. A modern Tasawuf. As Allah willed it. A lot of Sufi misinterpret Tasawuf... as an effort to isolate themselves from the world. They forbid worldly life and keeping wealth. But Allah never forbids all of those... if they are earned in a halal way. So the true spirit of Islam... is to sacrifice, Ummi. To strive, and to work. You're going to make more enemies. Let them be. One day, those people will realize that their hostility is misdirected. Right. Just pray for me, Ummi. So I can finish this book of Tasawuf. - If Allah wills it. - If Allah wills it. Engku Hajj. I think you need to see Hajj Rasul. There's no harm in studying from him who understands clearly what you mean to say to your readers. You're right. THE SINKING OF VAN DER WIJCK Peace be upon you, Father. Peace be upon you too. A man from Java. What have you learned from there, son? Why do you come back so soon? Praise be to Allah, I've learned enough, Father. I would like to teach here. - Teach here? - Yes, Father. Do you have a diploma? Not yet. - Peace be upon you, Father. - Peace be upon you too. Malik? How are you, Father? Sit down, Malik. How are you, son? Praise be to Allah, I'm fine. Raham and the kids send their regards to you. Peace be upon them too. Why are you here? I'm fine here. I will let you know if I'm sick. You don't need to waste your time coming here. Leaving behind more important matters. My purpose here is no less important. What is it? I need to learn something from you. Learn about what? There's nothing else to learn. You have enough knowledge. Didn't you always say... if one day we feel content... that is the day we'll stop trying. So here's the thing. I... want to learn deeper about Fiqih and Mantiq. Are you serious, Malik? Then get the Fiqih Islam book by Al-Ghazali, Al-mushtashfa Fi'ilm Al-Ushul, from inside. - Let's get them together! - Praise be to Allah. Yes, Father. For you, Mother. As Allah willed it. It's not that much. Praise be to Allah. Thank you, son. Have you met your father? Is he well? He is. Praise be to Allah. But... he got tired pretty quick. Unlike how he used to be. No matter how great a person is, age will surely catch up. The older they get, the weaker they will be in every aspects. Raham and the children send their regards to you. Peace be upon them too. Please pass my regards to Raham as well. - This is beautiful. - Praise be to Allah. It's cold, Father. When we open our window at dawn, that means we open our door to fortune. Wake up, kids. Wash your face. Let's prepare for subh prayer. Azizah. Come on, Zaki, Rusydi. Come on. Are you okay, Rus? I'm not feeling well, Father. Are you sure? Yes, I'm burning up. You're burning up, aren't you? Burning up like a cat's nose. Wake up and take wudu to cool your body off. The water will cool you down instantly. - Let's go. - Come on. In the name of Allah. That's my son. Oh, my God. Your sarong looks very shabby. Yes, it does, but it carries a lot of meanings. Son? - You're not going to the office? - Later, Ummi. Have you seen the time? An idea just came across my mind for next month's topic. I'm afraid to lose it if I wait, Ummi. But didn't you say you have a meeting with a Dutch captain? To account for your writing about Sukarno. They just have nothing better to do sometimes, Ummi. In the end, all they want is a bigger portion of the story. About building roads and bridges along the plantation. Very well. I will be leaving now. Take care. As Allah willed it. Take care. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. IDEAS OF HAPPINESS THE CAUSE OF INVESTIGATION Ummi. Yes, Engku? What is it, Engku? There's a letter from Hajj Abdul Karim, the Muhammadiyah's consul in Bengkulu. He invited me to come and meet Sukarno in his exile. HAJJ ABDUL KARIM'S (OEI TJENG HIN) RESIDENCE - BENGKULU Well, I read your thoughts from the magazine Mr. Tjeng Hin brought here all the time. - Mr. Tjeng Hin? - Yes. That was my name before I become a mualaf and changed my name to Hajj Abdul Karim. As Allah willed it. We need to talk. I really love to write a mualaf story like yours someday. An amazing writer and active in the Muhammadiyah, even a figure in the movement. But, of course, with a bit of romance in it. As long as you don't kill my character. But that's the kind of melodrama that our readers enjoy. Mr. Hamka here is not just an article writer, he also writes novels! That's too bad. I haven't read any of your books. It's pretty hard to obtain books here. I will send one to you then. If Allah wills it. Thank you. It's a great honor for me to have a famous movement figure like Bung Karno to read my books. Thank you. I have to admit, Minang people are truly incredible. One day, I will need your help to fight for this nation's fate. Poets and politicians are naturally partners. Politicians create a country's structure but poets will fill it with beauty, feelings and idea. You are correct, sir. I hope you can be a great poet one day. Just as India has Rabindranath Tagore. Thank you, sir. Ever since I received my invitation here, I've been determined to fight alongside you. Thank you, Mr. Hamka. From today, you're not just my comrade anymore... but a brother to me. Your father, Hajj Abdul Karim Amrullah, is my longtime teacher. He is also like a father figure to me. Thank you, sir. Let's continue. Sir. Where is Mr. Hamka? He's trying his new suit. I hope it fits. I'm sure it will. - How do I look? - You look great. You look dashing, brother. Thank you. Let's begin. Mr. Tjeng Hin, just sit down. Me and Mr. Hamka will stand behind you. Ready? Sir? One. Two. Three! On March 8th, a handover of power between the Japanese and the Dutch was carried out in Kalijati. The Japanese promises independence for Indonesia. We can't trust the Japanese. Japanese or Dutch, they're all the same. They just want to exploit our country! Japanese troops have arrived from Belawan and Dutch troops have been withdrawn from Sumatra! I seek forgiveness from Allah. I seek forgiveness from Allah. NIPPON THE LIGHTS, THE PROTECTOR, THE LEADER OF ASIA Thank you for your hard work. No struggle is in vain. Thank you for all your dedication. Allah is always with us in every step of our struggle. Freedom. Mr. Hamka. A warrant from Governor Nakashima. 29 APRIL IS THE BIRTHDAY OF TENNO HEIKA. "You are all ordered together to do Sei-Kei... Sei-keirei?" Sei-keirei. Praying while facing northeast. Towards the Japanese Royal Castle. I seek forgiveness from Allah. That's a blasphemy! You're not going, are you, Engku Hajj? You're not going, are you? Will they catch you if you don't go? I'm not afraid of being captured by the Japanese to fight for Islam. What I'm afraid of... is that the whole Muhammadiyah in Sumatra will be considered as rebels. What will you do, Engku Hajj? I will be there. Mr. Hamka, let me introduce myself. I am Nakashima. People saw in the yard that you did not bow. I will never do anything that goes against my religion. Mr. Hamka, that was Sei-keirei. That wasn't a prayer. It's an honor to Tenno Heika. Our emperor. Whatever that is, I only give honor to people that deserve my respect. Mr. Hamka, be careful with your words. I hope you're not planning to disobey the Empire of Japan. How can I respect those who have trampled on our nation? Who have oppressed our people? You closed our religious schools. You burned our books and magazines! You people even killed our ulamas. We're just trying to prevent chaos from happening. It is you who are creating chaos in this country! You have truly angered our people. Where is the peace that you always promised us? The peace you always boasted about, where is it? You're just nurturing the war to keep raging in this country. So... what do you want, Mr. Hamka? If you are truly our old relatives... then prove it. But remember. This is our homeland. We reserve the right to decide our own future. And never interfere with our religion. Our prayers, our reciting of the Qur'an, and our worship! You have to release our teachers, our ulamas and our fighters! Let us spread moral values in our own way. Mr. Hamka, I admire you. You have a tremendous spirit. Just like our Empire. And as such, I will grant all of your requests. However, you have to convince all ulamas to obey and stay loyal to Japan. From now on, you are a friend of Japan, Mr. Hamka. Maybe you can also be my advisor, of course, in the field of religion. What do you say? LONG LIVE MUSLIMS Mr. Hamka, along with Tengku Jafizhan and Syeikh Abdullah Afifudin, is attending the ulama conference in Singapore held by the Japanese. They pledged themselves to Japan, and expressed their gratitude as the Empire of Japan has freed the Muslims of Greater East Asia from the clutches of invaders. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Ummi is back here, kids! Come here and eat. Have lunch. - As Allah willed it. - I seek forgiveness from Allah. What happened to you two? We had a fight, Ummi. They started it first. They were mocking Father's name. They said he's a traitor. A Japanese bootlicker. I seek forgiveness from Allah. No, no, no. That's not true. Your father never did such a thing. But they see Father is really close with the Japanese. He did all of those because he loves this nation. He loves Islam, and all of you. Then we're not wrong to fight them, Ummi. We were defending Father, Ummi. Zaki, Rusydi, violence is never the answer. That means your patience has lost out to anger and hatred. You have hurt other people and you can never justify that. - We are sorry, Ummi. - Right, Ummi. Now go and take a bath, and eat with us. Yes, Ummi. Post-atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on the 6th and 9th of August 1945... AUGUST 15 1945 ...Emperor Hirohito announced the unconditional surrender of Japan to the Allied Forces on the 14th of August 1945. Praise be to Allah! Mr. Nakashima. The news, is it true? - Yes. The war is over. - Allah is The Greatest. I am not a governor anymore. I'm just Nakashima, who will return to Japan soon. Mr. Hamka, this is my car key. It's for you. Take it. Please, take it. Take this as a symbol of gratitude from me. You have been helping me all this time. What I did was to defend Islam and protect our nation from your oppression. I'm sorry, Mr. Nakashima. But I can't accept this. Farewell, Mr. Nakashima. We cannot trust Hamka to keep leading Muhammadiyah in East Sumatra. Didn't you realize his actions all this time? Thanks to him, the Muhammadiyah can continue its activity. Hamka has sold the dignity of young girls to the Japanese! That's why he had dozens sacks of rice sent to his house! - Slander! - It's the truth! Slander! It never happened. Mr. Hamka would never do anything that low! That is not slander. That is the truth. Our leader has received numerous rewards. He was even treated like royalty in Singapore. He was entertained and served by beautiful girls. Hamka has to relinquish his title as Muhammadiyah Consul in East Sumatra. If not, the whole Leadership Council will have to resign altogether! - We agree! - No! We can't just decide this one-sidedly. Slander! That's enough. I seek forgiveness from Allah. Allah is The Greatest. I seek forgiveness from Allah. TRAITOR! JAPANESE BOOTLICKER! ACCURSED USTAD! Thank you, everyone. I seek forgiveness from Allah. I really appreciate your opinion. I'm not here to defend myself. Some of what you have said is slander. But some of it is true. I admit my mistakes. I was disarmed by Japanese promises. So if you want me to step down, then I appreciate that. I ask of your forgiveness. The Jogja Muhammadiyah Council decided that Mr. Hajj Abdul Karim Amrullah will be removed from his position as the leader of East Sumatra's Muhammadiyah. Acting as the new leader of East Sumatra's Muhammadiyah is Muhammad Yunan Nasution. But you are still a consul in the organization. That is just for courtesy. Just to relieve their burden for pushing me away from the organization. Just look. They've stopped inviting me to meetings. Not even offering for me to be Imam at the mosque. They're too busy insulting me behind my back. I was blamed for all this. Not even a grain of respect left for me. Everything is forgotten because of prejudice and suspicion. I have failed as an example, Ummi. I can't... I can't spread Akidah Tauhid like I wanted to. It's all right. Just let it go. There's no use in lamenting in your sadness. Don't get carried away and lower yourself like that. You don't have to listen to them spouting trash. They are not your friends. They don't know who you really are. They don't know what you have been going through. But I knew! Before we become even weaker and can't think clearly anymore... it's better for us... to go back to Padang Panjang. And take the kids with us. Allah is The Greatest. Allah is The Greatest. ENGKU RASUL PASSED AWAY. ABDUL WADUD. Eating betel By its back If you need chalk, just add spit Tanah Deli is all about luck Thankful to be alive If we die, so be it Forgive me, Ummi. No dream was sacrificed, Engku. We just need to take a step back... before we can run towards the future. If Allah wills it, I believe you can do it, Engku Hajj. If Allah wills it. PADANG PANJANG WEST SUMATRA - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - I... - Don't worry, Hamka. I still believe in you. The people here still believe in you too. They would be happy to invite you to give da'wah in their mosques. Praise be to Allah. How are you? Thank you, Amir. Independent Indonesia! Indonesia has become independent! Indonesia has become independent! Praise be to Allah. Allah is The Greatest. Proclamation. We, the people of Indonesia... do hereby declare the independence of Indonesia. Matters concerning the transfer of power and other matters will be executed in an orderly manner... Allah is The Greatest. Freedom! ...and in the shortest time possible. Jakarta, 17th of August 1945. On behalf of the Indonesian nation. Sukarno-Hatta. Please give this to Buya, this is from the people. All right. Peace be upon you too. Praise be to Allah. Malik, I was entrusted to give you this. What is that? Just take it. I seek forgiveness from Allah. You don't have to, Mir. I can't accept this. They're sincere. Amir. I am already grateful to Allah to still be entrusted to give da'wah. My da'wah is not something for sale, Amir. Please pass on my gratitude to them. But I'm sorry, I cannot accept this. Think about your family. Your wife and kids... They have needs. I seek forgiveness from Allah. How about this, Amir? I'll trade my books for that money. Can you do that? Praise be to Allah. Here's the money, Uni. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'll take my leave, Uni. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. As Allah willed it. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Why are you sleeping here, Ummi? I'm sorry, Ummi. I am late. How are you and the kids today? Have you eaten? Praise be to Allah. We've eaten enough. Praise be to Allah. I've sold many of my books today. Praise be to Allah. You should bring your novels. If Allah wills it, it might sell. Ummi... Do you think the men in the mosque would be interested to read those books? You should offer them when giving out lectures for the women after reciting. Not many people can read, Ummi. Most of them are illiterate. If I travel to the corners of Sumatra... I would never find a woman like you. You should go to sleep, Ummi. Your face looks very tired. See? I will always accompany your midnight prayer. We have two prayer rugs now. As Allah willed it. Wake up, kids. Let's build a colorful nation. Those who pray subh together in the mosque, Allah will grant them blessings from all directions. I seek forgiveness from Allah. Ummi? - Where are the kids? - They went to the mosque earlier. - They are waiting for Imam. - I seek forgiveness from Allah. That means I'm the one who's late. Let's go, Ummi. Peace be upon you, Hamka! - Peace be upon you too. - Hurry up! Oh, my God, what is it, Mir? It's all over the radio. The Dutch and their allies are back. They are now in Medan. They will arrive in Minang in no time. The red and white flag has risen in our country. We must not let anyone bring it down, ever! The Dutch and their allies are back to seize Sumatra. We can't sit back and do nothing. Let's unite and fight! We shall not be a cowardly nation that is easily bought or sold by others! Remember, our fate is in our hands! Hear, hear! Let's welcome those invaders with a fight! Let's prove to the world one more time what Minang people really are! Once free, we are forever free! - Allah is The Greatest! - Allah is The Greatest! Allah is The Greatest! - Freedom! - Freedom! THE END OF VOL. 1 Pretend you're fishing! Get to cover! This is the time to unite and protect our freedom. We must not let the Dutch trample on our nation's dignity! Allah is The Greatest! - Freedom! - Freedom! You're conspiring to overthrow the President. We will destroy all traitors! Even if our life is sufficient, your heart still feels its absence. I can see it clearly... Just be Hamka. In this beloved land of Allah, we were born as brothers! Why would we wage war with each other? Grandpa! Ulamas have long been sold, and Allah is the buyer. And the payment is heaven. When you are ten years old, you'll be studying in Mecca. And I name you Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah. Father and Mother will get a divorce. I don't want you to leave. Who will protect me from Father's wrath? This kid has to be taught a lesson! You'll never become an ulama like your father! All you do is play, skip reciting the Qur'an and practice poetry instead. I'm going to Java. If you want to become a great leader someday, learn to write like a reporter and talk like an orator. It's about time you do something concrete with your life. Apply the knowledge that you've learned so far for your fellow human beings. Thank you. - I would like to teach here. - Do you have a diploma? Not yet. I'm ashamed. My knowledge is still inadequate. My understanding of Islam is still shallow. But I have the gall to be teaching you. I'm going to Mecca. I won't waste this chance. I will also perform Hajj. Faith without knowledge is like a lantern in the hand of a baby, while knowledge without faith is like a lantern in the hand of a thief.
