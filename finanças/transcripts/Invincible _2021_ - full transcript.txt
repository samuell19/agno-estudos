What does it mean nowadays for a woman to "have balls"? If she has the courage to speak up, to take action... that she has courage to dream big... And regardless of the sterotypes and adversities we step upon, we still act to make our dreams come true. Jedrzejczyk is on fire! She added another title to her collection! Joanna Jedrzejczyk dominates the 57kg category in Poland for many years. Joanna wins her UFC debut. It's gonna be my third fight in UFC, and I'm going to be a champion. Joanna Jedrzejczyk is the new UFC women strawweight champion! Nobody realised that this success would go so far people from a small town somewhere in Poland, are number one in the world. That is enough! This is my gift from God. And as the Bible tells you so, you need to nurture your talents. Excellent fighter! Made to be a star! Who's next? INVINCIBLE The older I get, the more I know, there is no emergency exit. There is only one way to succeed and this is hard work. Joanna is already an establish champion. She defended her title twice. Her fans, sponsors, they are expecting even more. We work with the fighters in corner as if we were playing a computer game. And it works well. It's our job to stick to the plan during the fight. Emotions, stress can lead directly to losing the belt. I know there's a process of building mental strength in her. But she can handle it. There is no need to add pieces to the puzzle because everything works the way it should. Hi, do me a favor, cook some green beans for me please? It doesn't have to be now. I am on my way to my physio. I won't have time later. A decent handful will be enough 25 grams, will be a lot right? Simple question, how much do you weigh? It is very important question for an athlete, that must lose 8, 9 kg. From 60 to 52 kg. This is quite a lot. Here she doesn't get what she deserves. This is the said truth. In the States she would be handled with utmost care. In Poland she is unappreciated. I will see myself in the States because it's a very open country with open people. So am I. At some point I made a decision to do my next training camp over there. To avoid the way I am being treated here. I feel down and depressed because of my coaches. Sometimes they see us fighters only as hard-working machine. I live with a big inner conflict within myself. I don't want to leave my family. but unfortunately to keep winning and remain champion I have to run away from here. I am scared of horror movies, I don't watch them. I don't know what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid of losing. But I'm curious about how it feels, It's been a long time since I lost in octagon but in life I lose daily like everyone else. I see myself how sometimes I can't run away from something. I can't make decisions because I'm afraid of something, although I never regret my decisions. THIRD UFC TITLE DEFENSE The MGM Grand in Vegas is absolutely the Mecca of combat sport for the last 20 years. UFC fans we'd like to welcome you to Las Vegas. And today we will witness one of the fiercest rivalries in the game. As Joanna Jedrzejczyk puts her... Regardless of how much her opponent trains, she is always going to train 10% better, 10% more. The belt stays with me. I get excited during the weigh-in, stare-down moments, seeing all those fans. Emotions are rising high and stay with me up until the fight. I put in a lot of work to prepare myself the best for this fight with Claudia Gadelha. This women is a tough fighter and at the same time very sensitive. It fascinates me that she is not ashamed of her faith in God. This woman brings it. She turned down TV shows opportunities, movie roles... All she wants to be is Champion! - As Gadelha's to a fast start. - Early knock-down for the Brazilian... Look how strong Cl√°udia Gadelha is. These are good hard shots here. Jedrzejczyk snaping of the jab here. Nice combination able to land. Nice elbows from the champ. Certainly, the champion landed the most effective strikes here and now. Can you see why the champion is undefeated? Even while experiencing adversity tonight, you do feel like she's in control of the fight What a chin! A huge right! What a title fight. And still the undisputed UFC strawweight Champion of the World... There are a lot of fighters in attendance here. They think you are so incredibly talented, they're in owe of you? What does it mean? I'm not. There is more better people than I, fighters... No, you deserve all the respect that they are giving you. They are are obviously so thrilled to be here for this championship performance. Congratulations, Joanna, it is so deserved. Always a pleasure to watch you inside the octagon. Is it fair to call you now the badest women on the planet? No Cris Cyborg, no Ronda Rousey, you're number one? I don't know... You put me in shame. I don't know. - Come on... You think it. - I am, I am, but... I feel like... - There is more badasses, you know. - I don't know about that, I really don't. We'll see you soon. Thank you so much, there she is Joanna Jedrzejczyk, the strawweight champion of the UFC. Tremendous stuff from her... What a performance it was... I want to buy myself a Mercedes when I return to Poland. Go for vacation with my mom and dad. Live like a normal person. I ate my donuts, so I don't have more dreams. The most important is that everything ended well. I want to do one or two fights and probably in 2017 finish with this sport. For career and everything in life you need to have big distance. I have big plans regarding myself and my family... Do you have something white for the laundry? I do. I am going to make a laundry for you. I have this blue shorts. This goes well with your white shirt. Come on! Let's take a picture! You are leaving? Yes. Take care. Thank you Pawel for everything. People are praising them. It is fair, they are good trainers, they created something big. I understand that, they have their families other fighters... But they should respect me more for what I achieved for my country, for European MMA, for them, for us. But this is not there, unfortunately. Here is the big thing, you're in Florida, right now? Right? Yes. I'm part of ATT Ok how did you end up at ATT? Why did you leave your team and end up there? This is all happening before the biggest fight, on the biggest court. People are afraid of changes, they like to complain, I don't like to complain. It was not easy for me to leave my gym, or my coaches or my management. But I want to keep on going forward. We've been in this sport for over 20 years. To get an athlete that's good enough to get to the UFC is hard enough, But then to get one that is in the UFC and could be succesfull in the UFC is even harder, But then to get someone successful in the UFC who could fight for the title it's almost impossible to have an existing champion come to our gym to say "Hey, I want to come to your gym..." I was like... "What?" Mike Brown, former WEC World Champion, is my head coach. There is Kami, responsible for my wrestling training, and Katel, responsible for my stand-up training. Two minutes! You don't get an undefeated World Champion come to your gym every day. So it's a real honor to work with an athlete like Joanna. If you decide to move to a place thousand of km away from from family and friends, then you facing loneliness. I have here people I can trust, some more, some less, but honestly you feel very lonely and this builds you up. I will be a stronger fighter not only physically but mostly mentally. Join the party. Guess what, I tell you what. It's Junior's in the morning. What? - Junior's, in the morning? - What's that? - The cheesecake place. - OK. This is a list of the cheesecakes that they have. - Holy shit. - We're in trouble. Is this like starting 4am? Krispy Kreme a dozen, a Dunkin Donuts blueberry muffin, and peanut M&Ms. - This is like between 4am and 6am. - I can't wait. Underhooks. Just stay focused. Underhooks, if you can. Elbows in, elbows in. Don't let her control the hand. It might be a little easier to put the weight up top, right? Because when I'm down here, even though the weight of your arms, it will be a little easier for you to put up front... Nice. You'll see some improvements I think for this fight. Mike Brown Former WEC World Champion But in the the next one is where you really start seeing I think bigger games. She's only have been here 6 weeks or 5 weeks something like this. So you don't want to change too much especially when an athlete is getting ready for a fight. FOURTH UFC TITLE DEFENSE I guess if you're not in the business you don't understand. Nothing is planned but of course they want to put up on a show, a little bit. Especially Connor is realising the more crazy he gets, the more fans he gets. I love the attitude. She's a fighter and she shows it. It's not forced, is 100% real. She's mentally tough and she isn't afraid of confrontation. She doesn't want it to be friendly between her enemy and her. That's the fight you wanna see. That's the fight that everybody wants to see. That's the fight, people will pay big money to see. But I told her the truth, that she's a dirty bitch. That's all. - Yeah, they had words... - You were right. I mean every fighter will appreciate it. - Most fans will appreciate it. - I'm honest about this. Everybody thinks that the job is just the fight night. No, the job is: the training camp, it's the everyday what you eat, it's the wakening up, it's the going to bed, it's training when you don't feel well it's missing your family, not being home... Missing anniversaries, birthdays, holidays, and doing all the media. That is the job. It's crazy. It's absolutely crazy. To have to schedule training for somebody at midnight, because that's the first free chance... 40 seconds, champion! 24 hours ahead of the fight, I cut down around 4 kilos. 10 days before the weigh-ins, I drink 8 to 10 liters of water. And each day I go down with the water. So my body still thinks it has enough of water supplies and my kidneys keep working so than the water is extracted from my muscles. I think she has one more pound to go, and a 20 minutes hot bath should do it. It's weigh-in day. Just one pound left to cut down. Just see how I feel. It's a happy day. I will eat. That's why I'm happy, guys. You're not a good company to talk guys. Joanna... OFFICIAL WEIGH-INS 114.4. Hi dad. Yup, all good. Just came back for weigh-in. And eating now. You called me earlier. I was asleep, then I had to jump into a hot tub to sweat out the last kg. She is weak. She's not that bad, but gets her ass kicked tomorrow, what can I tell you... She thinks she's a star, but she's not ready for it, she's just a simple small town girl. Take a couple sips, you'll feel better... Here you go, mama. - Hello salmon! - Hello delicious salmon! So tasty. This is a fascinating time for Joanna. Because it's very rare to see a champion, especially an undefeated champion who is doing so well. Who is fighting so dominantly, winning so dominantly and convincingly. And then all of a sudden changes teams, and not only that she change teams, she leaves her home country to come to the United States. Not only that she come to the United States she's going to a team that has a lot of other strawweight fighters, good strawwaight fighters, So I know I first said it may have been a little tough for her. This is someone unprecedented. You don't see this happen often. Maybe this is a blessing. Maybe she's been dealing with some sort of pressure at home. Maybe she felt like she outgrew that camp for quiet sometime, and now we're going to see even better Joanna. ...and her opponent, the reigning, defending, undesputed women strawweight champion of the world Joanna Jedrzejczyk! PUBLIC WEIGH-IN FOR FANS Welcome, New York to Madison Square Garden! How are you doing? Official weight: 114.5 pounds for the champion! All the time we must have connection, you know. And we'll always give you ideas. You don't have to use it, just some ideas. We won't yell too much, if we see something, we'll throw it out there. Maybe it feels right to you, maybe doesn't, so always your call. But I know that you will always see more much more than I. She trained really hard, she did everything right, she's completely healthy. So there is no reason why things won't go as they supposed to. Hi guys! This is Joanna champion! It's finally fight day! I can't wait till the evening. I am very calm, very focused. And very confident, that I'm going to win this fight with Karolina. Me and my girl Stephanie, from the Bronx we doing some nice hair. Nice look for the fight. We're just getting ready. My family is here, my friends, other crew, it's amazing, so... I'm getting ready, and you must make sure that you will be able to watch the show, get your pay-per-view, because I've heard, that tickets are sold out! So get a pay-per-view and watch me winning tonight. She at 5 feet 6 inches tall, weight in 114 and a half pounds. Fighting out of Olsztyn Poland presenting the reigning, defending, undisputed UFC women's strawweight champion of the world... That is a scary woman, Mike. Big time! So intense, and so focused, so driven and so ferocious inside the octagon. She is easily one of the most dominant and terrifying champions in MMA today. She got tagged! She got tagged hard! Kowalkiewicz moving forward. Can she finish her? She's just at the top of her game. Physically, mentally. Her confident at all time high, her nutrition... Her real issue right now, is a lack of suitable challengers. And still champion of the world Joanna Jedrzejczyk! I visualise my winning before the fight. But I aware that it's sports, anything can happen. I have my plan for the fight, so has she. But all of that can fall through, if we are not in good disposition on that day. You just have to be ready, for a real war. How do I look in the new glasses? You haven't' said a word. Yesterday I texted you. You look great. But the sms picture is not the same as in reality. Show it to me. You look great! Liar. Here you go. I wanted to help you. I have it. It's fucking cold. (one word in Polish) You see, you can have all the proper words. It's way too big for me, but it's my favourite. Such a large crowd. Have you ever imagined you'd be signing your books for three hours? I love being around people. They are so optimistic. Sure, I do it for myself and my family, but my fans make me happy. I am not ready to give up my UFC throne just yet. I will continue fighting. So there will be more stories that we can write about in the future. You can sign here. - I will jump from behind your back. - We have a great surprise. Joanna Jedrzejczyk! Look at me Joanna. I want to ask you about your opponent. Do you know much about her? Strong, very wild technique in boxing. Pokes with her left hooks. She surely is a worthy contender to the world champion title. But obviously I will do my best to keep this belt with us. FIFTH UFS TITLE DEFENSE She's a big star now, but I think it's only gonna get bigger. She's very charismatic, her skill level is getting higher and higher. She's already the best in the world. She is the only true undefeated world champion in the UFC. There ar no other champions that are undefeated. So she's something special. I just wanted to be closer to the champion. I love it! No eggs? - They wouldn't do the eggs. - That's why I've asked you for eggs. - They wouldn't. I asked, but... - Can we go eat breakfast somewhere? If you give me 20 minutes... Denise is on her way here with the kitchen. - Fine. So sorry, but... - You don't want to eat it? Okay. You want me to call downstairs again? How much longer? I need the fucking kitchen! I just need the small pan. She needs the omelet pan. All right. That's fine. I didn't sleep well. It was the worst, you know. She didn't sleep well, she had to be downstairs at 9:15. And then the car didn't show up untill 10:30. So she could have been sleeping. And when we got there and they're like, "Ok Joanna, you're on in five minutes." And she's like: "No, no I need hair and makeup." And he's like "No, then you'll missing." And she's like: "I'm not fucking doing this without hair and makeup." After four hours of sleep... So she missed the first sport center. She skipped it And then as a result, like couple other things got messed up. But she was: "I'm not fucking doing it." At one point she was like: "We're out of here." I said, "Ok, you just let me know, switch the flights right now." Hi, how are you doing? Good? Good to see you. Ready? Take care, guys. I feel good that I saw her. I'm like totally calm now. Good. Every fight at this level is dangerous. Every fighter has so much time now, to prepare for you. Because you are their ultimate goal. - I need more water, these pills are... - Stuck? Yeah, coming. So, is the training at 8. Mike knows about? Yes, Mike knows. Does she need a push or is this just for total technic? She need a little push. Does she need it or she doesn't need it? She was 26 this morning, she needs to go to bed at 26 to wake up at 24 tomorrow. - So you needs a little push. - Ok. Come on, we don't have much time. - Paulina, what time? - What time what? We're leaving. We're walking out of here 12:40. Must be downstairs at 12:45. Like I said, the belt is staying with me! Thank you so much, take care, have a good day. JJ, it's not even, it's got like pockets. Do you want to put it on the floor? - What? - It's got pockets, it's not flat. Here and this is solid and this is solid here because there's wood. So you're not sleeping flat. I don't feel... - Do you feel that it is flat? - I don't know, it's OK. The bed is too soft, the champ is not sleeping. They have a couple empty rooms. And if you need to start testing all the beds out, we'll just go from a room to a room. With security. She's like: Security can escort her to the empty rooms, and if she finds a mattress that she likes, we can switch it. Warrior mentality in her. But with a good heart. Good messenger. You need those kind of people in life, you know. In any business. Does't fucking bullshit. Kami Barzini wrestling coach, coach I'm fucking for real, does't fucking bullshit me. Cause I'm coming for your ass. The weight didn't go down over night. I sweat a lot since yesterday morning, and nothing. Something is wrong. The weight should be less and not stay the same. The second thing is: I should suffer less, not more. I did my part. Others just need to do their job, if not I am pissed off. Pain is a subjective experience. How we approach it, how we feel psychologically definitely has a significant impact on how we experience psin. Joanna is a very strong personality. And I sometimes wonder when she can't take it anymore. And I don't see that coming any soon. It's mentally tough making weight. You are very hungry, thirsty, you have no body fat, you have no water in your system, but you still find a way to sweat more. It's not fun, it's not easy. But she's as strong as I've seen anybody ever in my life. I don't like when my family look at me when I work hard. The weight cut is part of our job, but it's not nice I feel that we must go through this. The thing is I like that they can relax. I don't like when they see. When I'm hurt, because it's not easy. I don't want to see tears in their eyes. I want them to be happy and enjoyed my fight on Saturday. It was nice to see them relaxing. After the fight, we'll have some time all together. So our friend Delilah is crazy. She's crazy as fuck. My favorite. J. keeps saying that when she grows up, and gets older, she wants to be like Delilah. Ready? Let's go! I'll bring ice in a second. Can I have some water, please Water? And she's gonna go down, no problems at all. She just needs to take off her sports bra. 115.0. Some coffee and two toasted almonds. You got it! This is the best of you, tonight. Have fun out there. Your time! It's our time. It's our time to shine. Lot of people believe this will be Joanna Jedrzejczyk toughest title defense. Look at that! Just power! To pick her up and throw it down! Again. Joanna Jedrzejczyk, a multiple time world Muay Thai champion. And then to take those and leek high level striking skills and dominating MMA the way she has you have to have a very a special mind. She dominates and she continues to move forward. To try to tie Ronda Rousey for most successful title defenses in female UFC history. And still champion of the world Joanna Jedrzejczyk! Hi! How are things dad? Hi family! I'm happy. Good. Great. Adam, how was the fight? - Adam, have you seen the fight or not? - M&M's anybody? - Ozzy? Come on! - Hell yeah! I don't even like M&M's. Will you send me a kiss or not? Bummer, you don't love me anymore... All right then. Bye. Come on! - Where is everybody? - They went to change. I wash my hands. Bitches got stitches And you collected your riches - Good? - Yes Remember, one day you can be a champion you can be the richest person in the world, the boss or the director of some big company, but remember, the next day you can be at the beginning again. So respect people, and it's about the right relationship - Amazing. Well said. Enjoy the victory. - Thank you! I hope that when you go home whenever that time comes, that they give you the heroes welcome that you deserve in Poland. I hope that they start covering more, treating you... You're the best polish athlete living and breathing in the world today. So I hope they put ona a parade for you, for what you're doing in the UFC. Is that in the works? Can we get that happen? Yes, that's cool, that could be great! Thank you very much! - Sugar? - I'm good, thank you. - What happened - My bag... it didn't came out. I'm waiting for my bag. They all came out and mine wasn't there. It was there, but for some reason they had it behind the... Really? It barely made the flight I guess. It was a close connection. - Good to have you. - Looking good, looking good. Once you have your champ title and you defend it for the second, third, fourth time, it's not that easy any more. It gets tougher every time. Same with making a record. If you have one good record out, then the following records need to be better and better. It's so hard to be on top all the time. It's the strangest thing in my life. Music, my passion, my way to get away from reality, suddenly became the biggest source of stress in my life. Everything has its own color, shades. Everyone sacrifies himself the same way. True. True. But in music you don't have to sacrifice your life like that. When you talk about the fight, the instinct comes the instinct like survive. How she controls that feeling, that instinct makes her dangerous. Like I told you, she's not normal, she's not human because... She can be very aggressive, and at he same time she can look at you and smile. Good morning. It feels like Christmas this morning. Did you sleep? The fight Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs Conor McGregor Let's hear. - It's so interesting. - Oh man, I cannot watch this. This is crazy yeah? Nice! - Unbelievable! - You know how it is in boxing. Aggressiveness won't always get you the round. You gotta really land a shot. For me, he's the winner doesn't matter what's gonna happen. Keep your chin down. Too dangerous. Tie him up! He looks vulnerable. - Hurt or is he exhausted? - Exhausted. Went from having some pop to no gas at all. There is a lot of stress with our sport. I think more stress than with any other sport in the world. It's not just the pressure of winning and losing. There is a lot of performance anxiety. Also your health is is on a line. If you have a bad performance, it could mean that you break an arm, or leg, or you're knocked unconscious. There is a lot on the line. Ego, money and health. SIXTH UFC TITLE DEFENSE We're the opposite of her. We do normal office jobs, live normal lives. Joanna was always rarely home. She always had something to do, even until today. Welcome UFC strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk. So I'am like: smell it, smell it, taste it! It's like brushing your hair, you know? So you go like... This is exactly how I brush my hair! UFC 217 at Madison Square Garden. Joanna she's gonna kick some butt! She has neverending ambitions. It's never enough for her. And after winning this fight, she'll still feel unsatisfied. What's that? So the persons name is Eric? That she's speaking to? Okay, hold on please. That important thing is, that I keep my belt, and I will stay undefeated. This is my goal: to retire as undefeated in the future. And that's even more difficult, than all those records. I was born for that! I'm a real fighter. I am a real warrior. I know how to take the fight. It's all about sport, about art. And I'm an artist in the octagon. If you look at this business now, women are a major part of it. Joanna Jedrzejczyk could end up being one of the greatest ever if not the greatest ever and I ain't talking about the women I'm talking about fighters. You're not appearing to get into Roses head you know she's a top level fighter. Are you taking her seriously? There is only one strawweight queen of the world. And it's me Joanna the champion She's big for this weight class, it's not easy for her. You can see that she has no body fat. It's not easy to make the weight. I don't think she likes to tell people about how tough it was or if you guys should know that it was even tough. 115. Official weight 115 pounds for the champion. Boogie women is coming for you Rose! The Boogie women, ladies and gentlemen! What did they show before my weight in? This other fighter... - Nothing is important anymore. - Only tomorrow. Adam did you draw this by yourself? Is this you? Blue eyes. You can learn everything about me: How tall I am, how much I weigh, where I am from, Olsztyn Poland. Everything is on there. The one with your autograph, I like the most. The other one I can sign as well. Do you want? There you go! - He's talking so calm. - Thank you. - I put it in my jacket. - Leave it here, Adam. Strawberry M&Ms. First meal after the fight. During the the verdict announcement I will through it to you. They're taste great! - Oh my goodness! - Hello! God bless you, ok. Thank you so much. Let's go, champ! Is this going to be a kick-boxing match? And can Rose hang with one of the best kickboxers on the planet Earth? Use the cage! Use your back! Straighten up! Straighten up! Tuck your chin! That's it. It's over! Unbelievable! - I'm so sorry. - We love you J. Hallo. Hi. Everything is alright. Hang in there. Hang in there. Don't cry. - It's all good. That's how sport is. - Don't cry. There's nothing you can do. - But do you feel ok? - Yes everything is alright. But why.... Normally, she cuts weight in 5 hours. Here it took her 15. She didn't have time to recover. There was simply no way she could recover. She was too heavy the day before. It was like 15, 16 pounds. And we have about 15 or 16 hours to do it. And that's a lot. That's a lot for a heavyweight, or 2 or 5 pounder. Never mind the smallest weight class in the organisation. 115 lbs that's a big drop. Large percentage of her body weight, in half a day. It was mistake at work, and it was very big surprise. That's it! That's it! I've been training very hard for this fight. It's a big surprise for me, for my coaches. But I will keep my head up. I'm not a champion anymore, but I will be back, stronger. But I'm still a professional athlete. I've been doing this for half my life, for 14 years, so... Definitely I will keep my head up, and take this as a champion, as a former champion. You have to wonder. So many factors in this fight. Did Joanna underestimated the striking? Was she too vulnerable? Was Rose just getting better? That's important That's how you stay on top. You know how it is... You've done it. And now we gotta get back. Yes we will. She handled that loss better than 99.9% of the population. She handled it very well. She's really smart girl. She's smart. She's mentally tough. Most people wouldn't had made the weight. But she made the weight. Just the way she handled herself that night. All supplements from ALLMAX are good I need BCAAs and Carbion. Could you check that for me please? Thank you so much, I just wanted to hear you and... Yes, take care. Bye. Have fun. Hi. Do you have any Greek yogurt? Sodium, sugar 6, 7 ups. I feel the same weaknesses often. I improve and I want to be better every day. I feel that the sensibility that is me, is the same as ten years ago. I had bad days, days with tears in my eyes, where I wanted to give up. My arm got scared of you. When you said I'am coming back and we work immediately. - So no pain anymore? - Right, doesn't hurt anymore... Basically everything is the same. What happened that don't look so worn out? I found freedom finally. Everything sets itself differently. How I sleep, how I eat, everything, everything... Ok, there are more presents. I share it with you, because I'm excited. I enjoy giving gifts to others and prefer giving over getting. But here it is... My dear sisters and Adam. Here is a picture taken on holidays after my November fight. Kasia, my twin sister and my older sister, Ewa, who doesn't have Instagram and Adam are coming to see my next fight and then holidays. I asked for a new Polish national flag for the upcoming fight. So here it is. White and red colors. I am in the midst of my camp and it is going good. And I'm glad Kamil is here. She was resisting me and my arm was stuck right here and I felt the pain. I got scared something bad happened, but it is ok now. I had to work it through. Mobile phone ban for an hour. It suppose to be quick. There is no time to wait, there must be consequences. Part with people and things that don't work and move on. To have a next goal, to push boundaries, to challenge yourself. and this is what I do: I challenge myself. Let's go! She set her legacy. She can do whatever she wants. She's a champ. And she's still be the champ event if she doesn't have the belt or she does. REMATCH - Germophobe. - Germophobe? - Like germ... - Like "Germany?" Germ? Just like germs. She is a little bit cause she always like will put a towel on the mat and set her gloves on top of the towel. She doesn't put her gloves and training gear on top of the mat. She's always like... - Worried about these bacteria... - I'm not a germophobe. But... I am. Make people bloody is different than get dirt from people. Thank you! Thank you so much. Do you mind signing this? You signed my other one at 205. Made history before, do it again. People change, I have new people around me. I'v got a new taste in my life, in my fighting life as well. But mostly as a human, and this is what I love about. I took care of my diet, I feel great, I'm three pounds over So it's easy. I don't have to go trough the weight cut. I'm super happy, I feel more than ready. This is what I said after my last fight, That I was going take care of my business more than before. She is in a good place. I think she's really relaxed, that's very important. A lot of it is mental warfare "selling the fight". But it's but you gotta know when the right time to use it and when not to use it. I think she has good grasp for that. Guys, we just had a media day. We're at Barclays Arena, this is my home for Saturday, look at this I will get back what belongs to me, I promise to you guys. Watch it, cheer, support... Watch it on TV. There is no need to push too much on what I'm gonna do. I think this is the one where you just show them. 114 even. - Did you make the weight? - Of course. - What's up? - Nothing. I am labeling products now. I am putting price tags on this chips here. Show him those chips again. Look at this. She's putting the... What a coincidence. My coaches are saying hello. Say hi to them, mom. I will do some small training today maybe. OK, cool. What will you having? Do you like spicy? Okay, we got you. Ok. We will prepare your first one around 11:45, OK? And then from then on it's gonna be bam, bam, bam? Thanks, champ, I appreciated. You're awesome. - It's been an honor working with you. - Thank you so much. We will feed you until tomorrow. Watch it! Get that belt! See you later guys. ... to the bus, we will bring you back here nice and safe and sound... You can go to the city by car, if you're still on the same time I will have those in the rooms, I'll get those to you guys at the arena. We are off to weigh-ins. They let him come. He will be on stage with me. Take care and sorry for waking you guys up. Alright. We love you guys. You wait with Mike, when I step on the scale. Now the pressure is on. Teach him. One, two, three, four, five. - Once again. - Five. And now face of. Face of! Come on! Look here. Today it feels like a bank holiday. People should put their suits and white shirts on, and come see Joanna in her olympic shape. And the final result doesn't mean much. Things that led up to this moment are far more important than the end result. The way she stood back on her feet and decided to put her gloves on again. Someone asked her: Will the next fight be for the belt? Joanna said: No, the next fight is going to be rematch. And if it's a title fight I don't care. It would be great if she wins. She's there to really build a legacy. She wants to go down as the best strawweight of all time. Perhaps as the best female UFC fighter of all time. She's already there. Best striking rate in UFC history. Best striking differential in UFC history. She was on two two big pay-per-views as I mentioned one with Ronda Rousey, and one with Conor McGregor. She's out there just picking you apart, she's an assassin. If he doesn't take you out with the first bullet, she will take you out with the last one. Or she's totally content of seeing you bleed to death in the octagon. It's just amazing how she's matured, and how she continues to improve. So brilliant watching her fight. You see that she's at a different level. Joanna, here we go! Believe me or not, but I was like two times at the beach for last 10 weeks. - That's it? - That's it. Maybe three. Two times... But I go after this. So this is the idea after the fight? No, I flying home to Poland for 2 months, I'll be super busy, I miss my family. I never gonna forget when he did my wraps before my first title fight with Carla Esparza. He's like: Are you a puncher or a grappler? You wanna punch her? Hell, yeah! He's like: I help you! That is an easy one. - And then he said: told you! - It was a good performace. We're gonna duplicate it again tonight! New story! Everything is ok. Let's take a picture. Come on! They only gave you one round. Each judge gave you one round. It was all different rounds. Second, third... Somebody gave you the second and not the third. Sometimes I wonder myself, how much longer she wants to go? And than when does she wanna become a wife and a mom? Physically, she has several years left I think of being on top. And myself I would like to see her take on some new challenges for at least a couple more years, but we'll see. It took Joanna almost two years to fight for the title again. In 2020 she faced Zhang Weili and lost via split decision. The fight was not only UFC Fight OF THE YEAR but also the GREATEST FEAMLE FIGHT OF ALL TIME. Revised and Synchronized by FAST TITLES MEDIA
