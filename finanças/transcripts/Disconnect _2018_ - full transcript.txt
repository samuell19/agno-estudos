Celine? Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Celine? Surely Celine. - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! - Wake up… You've been avoiding me. Why? I can take a couple of days off, okay. I'm grown. It's nearly been a week Celine. Ugh! Now you know I have to kill you right? Like there's no other way around it. Yeah you can do that once you get up. Why do you hate me? I'm about to risk getting an infection by entering that kitchen to make you some tea. I don't want some tea… Chamomile with honey? Okay... There's no chamomile or honey or any form of sustenance. I need some orange juice. There's some orange juice. That should do you good. Mmhmm… Ugh! No orange juice for you. Okay, talk to me... You can tell me. So I couldn't sleep that night I was thinking about him. I don't know, maybe I was tired of this open relationship. Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! That's…disgusting. So you know that handbag is an abyss right? And I think I lost a phone in there five years ago and I just found it. Hopes and dreams go in there to die. You worry about your own life please. Is Tupac in there? So early in the morning I rocked up at his… He was there, watching rugby. I was thinking of, maybe taking things up a notch. Mmmh…Hindsight, I should have known. Well, well, well! - Hello! Hello! So, what did I miss? - Thanks. What? I needed backup. Ehhh? Tell me... What? I don't have to tell you guys anything. Come on, we're good. Right Josh? Mmhmm Who is going to tell me what's going on? Come o… ‪ "Why do I…" Ugh! Fine. Okay How do your friend here decided that rocking up at Ken's house for a booty call was a good idea. So, she got over there and was flaunting herself and all. Waaa! Okay so now I have both questions and comments. So you guys will tell me which one to start with first. Actually... Let me start with comments. Cause if I…it just feels like a great place you know to explore how much judgment I've reserved for you. Mmhmm Tell me. What were you doing at Ken's place? As early as 6 a.m? - That kinda sounds like a question. - I know, I've changed my mind halfway. I don't know, okay? It was bad, and I need some time! Celine no. ‪That is highly counterproductive to what ‪we're trying to achieve here. It was bad, ehh? I had this trench coat over sexy lingerie. I get over him and begin a sexy dance. He looks shocked. I thought the surprise worked. I mean it's a free booty call early in the morning. I would be excited too. - Ohh! - Then she spoke. - Damn! - Yeah. - Shit. - Wow! Exactly! I'm just gonna take a quick pause on this, it pre love moment we are sharing right now. But I have lots of questions! Weren't you guys in an open relationship? Nah, I never really understood that. Ummh, actually the correct term is non monogamy. Ah, booboo you are not going to "ummh actually" your way out of this. You're the one who made a huge deal about; being progressive, giving a man space, not being contained by flawed expectations of the human condition, ‪that go against our very nature. That is quite a speech. Yes! Quite the vagina monologue Josh. Babe, what really happened? Celine! Celine! Celine stop! - You made that last part up? - Yeah. But I did listen to Lemonade the entire way home - Did you cry? - I cried! So now? It's over? Wait, I still have lots of questions! I need a shower. Absolutely, you smell like death flavour of a very heavy flower... - So heavy - Well I hate to interrupt this little Sisterhood of the travelling pants moment but gotta go to work. Goodbye. Why are men so fragile? - So fragile... - And by the way. Kenneth is an ass for losing you. Oh my gosh, I feel so much better now. Now that you've said that, like I'm healed.- I can't; men are trash... you're awesome. Thank you so much, Goodbye. Okay. Let's go, I pick an outfit for you. Something decidedly lesbian… cause you, you need to be off men. - For a while. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yes. We scheme for them? Aai, Hallelujah! Hi. Hey? The hounds you sent dragged me out of bed. I missed you too. Hi. Thank you! Hello. The place hasn't burned down. That's good. - Yeah, we're trying to... - Hey. There he is. Well another week off. Huh! So what was the problem this time? On a scale of death on Grey's anatomy and of course your ovaries raging war on your uterus? Does your wife kiss you with that mouth? - All she gotta kiss is a whole… - Oh my! I've regretted it as soon as I asked. - Thank you - Am I not allowed to tease the boss? Your casual misogyny is getting old Patrick. Ohhh! Triggered. Listen, I have some free time if you wanna pop in and consult on - perimenopause - You're an orthodontist. - I do know my way around... - Please don't finish that sentence. - Preeti. - Patrick. Why did we hire him? He is good. I am. And then there is that. Mmhhm. Yeah, the patriachy does pay my car insurance. I'm painfully aware. Here you go. What? New patients on paper… I thought you guys were trying to get me to go digital? It's the proposal. In hard copy… - cause you're terrible with emails. - I am not! Really? I will have a look at it I promise. I've heard that before Celine - and this time you really need to… - Hi Mrs Njuguna, how is it that you always get younger every time I see you? I hope you're a better dentist than you are a liar. - Well you keep coming back. - Why not? - It's nice to see you Mrs Njuguna. - And you too. Still wading in the murky waters of solitude? Ah! Um..I'm sorry? Yes, yes. She's still single. - Payback - Three months later? Ah, it hasn't been that long. Has it? Mrs Njuguna does have a standing appointment with us. A three-month standing appointment. Is there really no one for her? Ahhh, Um..I'm sorry? What? I'm sure Preeti is fine being single. Right? Poor girl. - There's no one. - Celiiiiine! Come on.

I don't know. I wanted to, surprise him. - With some morning head? - Yes TK, with morning head. How is that such a bad thing? Umm, fornication for one? Go away! Say, as much as I've come to appreciate your 40-year-old virgin acts, some of us need some good stroke on a regular... Oh my god! You said it girl. Stop it. No no, seriously, why even did you have a key to his house? For emergencies. Now I think even he forgot he gave it to me. You guys should have seen the look on his face like "I fucked up." No, no, no. He fucked up. Ayee, let's not speak ill of the dead surely. I shouldn't have gone there. The ghosting was a hint. - So, was she hot? - TK?? Seriously Toni! It's just a question. Okay. It's okay. Is that? Yeah. Yooo, she is hoooot Yeah. I can't imagine what that must have felt like. I can still…feel the heat from the tarmac. Well Samantha is in grief... Some volume, turn it up. No guys. No it's fine, it's okay. I cradled him when I cried for help. That sling, it looks like an accessory. Yeah and the heifer is working it. It's okay, you're okay now. I don't trust her. Hey Toni, a man is dead. And, she's in hospital? Yeah! With her face full of make-up. And yet his body is not even cold and she's already giving an interview. Guys? She has make-up on. And brows on fleek? Okay. She does look good though. Fam, her boyfriend just died. An entrepreneur always searches for change. Responds to it, exploits it as an open window. You genuinely scare me sometimes. - What are we watching? - Opportunity! Anyway. All right guys. - Let's focus. - We have a big… Holy shit! She's here. You actually did it Belinda Muli I'm gonna get you really drunk so you can tell me how you managed to pull that off Actually involves alcohol, and her secretary and my penis. Alright, focus. Miss Muli. Miss Muli, it's a pleasure to meet you in person. Yes, I imagine it is. Thank you so much for seeing us today Miss Muli. Call me Belinda. We were surprised that you came to our offices. We would have been happier to come to yours. It wasn't necessary. Well Miss Muli or rather Belinda wanted to come and see where her money is going. - Isn't that right? - Yes, intimately. You're a sharp cookie. I think you'll find that this particular jar is full of them. Miss Muli, would you like something to drink? No thank you. Okay, um. So, we sent you a proposal about us the company, and we are the premium… bouquet to... What just happened? - You could lend a hand. - Where's the fun in that? I'm a feminist. No seriously Celine, it's a two-day trip. Come on. It's a wedding Josh. How many weddings are they planning to have? - Look if you didn't want to do this… - Relax.

You know, I don't recall you guys being that… How was the funeral? Uneventful. CC you're taking this death a lot harder than I thought you would. I think it may have been my fault. Partly. You're doing that thing again. That thing where you make something that has absolutely nothing to do with you about you. Don't look at me like that, you know it's true. Remember when Prince died? Oh my god that was devastating. Yeah, and you cried the entire week and then said that he was selfish. He knew how much I needed that new album, and then what does he do? He goes and dies. Disrespectful! And then there was Whitney Ok now that was just uncalled for. I had tickets to see her live. Selfish! You don't mean that do you? Of course not, she's the voice of our generation. Her and Beyoncé. All that, hidden nonsense you listen to. I feel like you've been practicing - that Judy impression for a while. - I have. You know she called me a devil hugging demon because I forgot the Lord's Prayer. What? How does she come up with these things? I know right. The car… - The red Peugeot. - No. - I thought you said no CC. - It was just supposed to be a soft loan. There's nothing soft about a down payment on a sissy vehicle. That coupe was beautiful. Anybody who drives a coupe is viscerally vain. - Your dad drives a coupe. - Well he's intrinsically one of those. Bottom line CC, it's not your fault that he died in the accident.

Thanks, I'll see you later. - Alright. - Wait, you're not staying? - I made so much food. - I need to go and see the folks. - Tell your mum I have her sweet potatoes... - Oh my gosh mom Let the boy go. - Honestly, I think she's just scared. - Oh my gosh mom stop. Ok Mama C. Take care. I will never be a grandmother. Oh hey boo! - Hi! When did you get here? - Like an hour ago. - Mmm - Oh by the way the ladies are here they're super excited. - And you? - I ran away. - And did you see the goats? - All 99 of them? Nicholas is not playing. Why did you run? I just needed to find somewhere quiet to pray. I should have just stayed at my Dad's house here. Yeah? Why didn't you? I just don't like being alone. And the house is too big. I get the feeling it's… Haunted. By who? The ghost of the privileged past? The Mau Mau. Oh my god! Toni collect your friend. No no no, friend is a very strong word. Please, no, no. Get married. You know I just might. What? Are you serious? Yeah. I'd argue I'm more significantly more than a bunch of goats, but yeah. You? Slay queen. Eh, Martha Karua has softened. Our Ayn Rand. What, I can't get married and fight patriarchy too? Does everything have to be about the patriarchy though? - Yeah. - Preety much! And besides I wouldn't expect someone who's dedicated her entire life to a fictional character and his father in a story book. Ah? Ouch! You spit that out right now! Hey, can the members of the feminist brigade - come help me in the kitchen? - Sure. Now this one, is tied to her husband, I'm sure she won't let go. Just see how he spoils her. Such a comedy. Let's go! The meat is ready and the women are at the gate! And that venue is lit. It's quite something Robin. Thanks for running interference T.

Look at this one, thought your dad knows you are already married to Jesus. Amen to that. Hi, hand them over. What? We love Nicholas but he has a gentle disposition. You know they are gonna tear him apart if he gets nervous and gets this wrong this time. - I mean last time was hilarious, right? - Yeah, right. Why did he pick me? I am.. Don't even try to say it's because you are light skinned please! - I was going to go with tall. - Sure. That boy almost cried. You know he'll still owes baba like more goats even after he had given like a thousand cows after that wedding fine Are you girls ready? You know, your husband is greedy.

See you. Mama C, I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. Give me a second, I'll get something for you. Okay. - I'll be in the car. - Alright. Did you love him, the boy that died? How did you…?
