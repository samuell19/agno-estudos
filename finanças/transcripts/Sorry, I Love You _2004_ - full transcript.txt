Mommy is sorry Right ankle bone and the knee ligaments are damaged. Fortunately only one leg is damaged. Once the cast is off, he should be able to walk. The problem is the heart, The heart? During the operation, a heart failure occurred, which took much of the time. According to his record, Mr. Choi Yoon genetically has a very weak heart. We have to wait for the further test results but, I think the chest hit the handle hard in the accident, the heart might have developed a serious problem. Get some rest and, let's wait for the results. Yoon,Yoon, are you awake? Yoonah, are you awake? Mom yes, mom is here...mom is right here. Eun-Che Where is Eun-che, Ajuh-shi?

If you get involve with me you'll never get away till death I love you It just happened that way I love you Some people might just enjoy and spit out love like a piece of gum, but for some they would die for love. Think of it as being punished for your sin, Ajum-ma! I would like to put the apt. on rent...yo Oppa. He wouldn't take our Yoon as well right? All i have left is Yoon... he's my everything... He wouldn't take him from me right? Of course If he's alive he would be about 27 years old. The child that died without even seeing the daylight... If he was alive, he would be 27 years old today. I was counting the days without knowing... if he wasn't dead... today would be his b-day, oppa. Wait...Uncle is your twin so it's his b-day as well, Mom, let's call Uncle. Eunche, Eunche Uncle! Hurry up! 27 years ago, An actress fell in love with a director with a family of his own. And she gave birth to twins, But the twins were brought to an orphanage as soon as they were born, Maybe because they were afraid of the scandal, Maybe they wanted a way out no matter what happens to their own children. Anyhow, one of them were adopted to a foreign country he got abandoned by adopted parents... grew up like garbage The other one got hit by a truck while seeking mother at age of 5, Since then she has mind of 6 or 7 years old, living with a child who doesn't even know his own father. Right will prevail! What comes around goes around! Ancestors were so smart, How did they learn such a great wisdom? Who,are you? You've grown old as well, I saw you with the twins in front of the orphanage 27 years ago, I guess no one can beat time. Oh,I should have asked Eun-che nuna to come as well. You're right, should have asked. I wanna see Eun-che nuna. Where is Eun-che nuna? Where is she? Mom, I can't believe this! Yoon wouldn't let go of Eun-che's hand. For real! Eun-che can't even go to bathroom, the bastard tightly holds Eun-che's hand even when sleeping, I'm not playing, seriously, She wants you on the phone because she thinks I'm lying. Yeah, mom, Suk-che is right, he's holding Unnie's hand to death, even if Unnie shortly let her hand loose, the heart rate sky-rockets,so she can't let go either. There is a medical term for this psychological state what was it that nurse unnie said, of course she couldn't eat, barely goes to the bathroom Are you ok? Min-che! Choi Yoon oppa is on the newspaper *article reads:Choi Yoon over coming the car accident by singing'* I'm very sorry for worrying all of you... but because of you most of the wounds are healed and recovered a lot from the injury as well. You shouldn't over work your self, are you going to be ok? You ok, Yoon? I don't have to worry right, son? Where is he? He's not answering the cell, Fell asleep? Yoon, wait for a bit, I'll be back after I check the car. Eun-che! yeah? You and I, there's some place I wanna go together. Isn't it pretty? Isn't it just like you? What is this? It's your car now. Huh? Charge my credit for this car. Yoon! Full payment please. Yes,thank you. Wait, Ajuh-shi We won't buy this. Give me a ride in it for a while You know that my license is suspended right? But still I can't accept this, Yoon Carrying my clothings that are 10 or 20 times heavier than you... watching your arm dragging, it's was always painful to see. I'm ok, Yoon my arm muscle is still good and strong, and my arm is naturally short, even when dragged,you know? I'm not a rookie at being coordinator. You never said a word about it. Why all of sudden? I was looking another girl so I didn't notice you back then. That girl made me so blind back then, I couldn't see your arms being dragged, and how tired you are Sorry for being so late, Can we drive it out of here? I know your evil plan, you're acting all nice but actually you're plannning to use me for multi-purpose right? coordinator and driver. You only became more cunning after the car accident, manipulative bastard Fine,I'll take it, The fact is, I've been loyal to you for so long, I deserve something like this, If you ever take it back, icI'll... Ahh,what are you doing... Your hand saved me. During the accident... when I was thinking "I'll die,it all ends here" suddenly I heard your voice. It's ok, Yoon, it's nothing,. don't go anywhere, don't listen to anything, just hold my hand tight, it's ok, it's nothing, Till I die I'll never let go of your hand every again, Keep driving, I'll answer it, It's Moo-hyuk hyung.

Don't question the past, just forgive me. I didn't know much back then, I didn't know that I'm nervous when you are gone, or when you eat something good and delicious, I feel happier than if I would be eating it myself I didn't know that it was love how could I have known? I love you, Eun-che, sorry for realizing that so late. I'm going to call dad. I'll going to ask him to drive you back home with this car. Hey! Eun-che! You sold the condo and moved to this town? I've been thinking hard about Park Mr. Hyun-woo, I mean Mr. Cha Moo-hyuk, but I just can't figure you out at all. Who are you, really? Is it something about Yoon? Do you have a grudge against Yoon? I lost Yoon and Eun-che the only people who really loved me, I lost them both because of you! Sorry. I'm really sorry. I could tell Yoon. I could tell everything to Yoon. Do whatever you want. Tell Yoon that you got seduced by a bastard who is your manager. Should I also tell him that I'm still being seduced by the bastard? I didn't know much back then, I didn't know that I'm nervous when you are gone, or when you eat something good and delicious, I feel happier than if I would be eating it myself I didn't know that it was love how could I have known? Do you like me too? -No Then why poke a man standing still? If a girl you love gets hurt, you wouldn't interfere now, would you mister? Give Me...
