Haejoo, the latest report on Kumho Electric! It's closing time and I'm really busy Call me tonight, bye - Hey, Haejoo! Haejoo! - Hi. I have a special for you today It's the civilized man's commodity, the toothbrush And not just any toothbrush but in 7 rainbow colors No matter how big your family is, everyone has their own color So there is no confusion In department store's this sells for 5 bucks But as a special promotion I'll subtract 4 and give it to you for just one buck Jiyoung! How are you? Give me a call, okay? Jiyoung! How are you? Give me a call, okay? You're the first friend of Jiyoung's to come here. Have some dumplings Thank you. It looks good My, how pretty you are - I'm okay. Please have some, too - I'm fine. Have some more What brings you here? I came for a visit to see how you were doing. I was curious I thought we might go for a walk Why haven't you called me? I sent a lot of text messages I had a lot to take care of Don't worry too much about the other day with Haejoo - Jiyoung, do you want some oysters? - No, thank you Can I have one, too? Hey, look how I'm doing it Like this Are your studies going well, on textiles or something? Yeah Are you giving me this? If you like it, keep it Thanks. Wow, you draw really well But it still must be a little boring Hey, these are daily toothbrushes It'd be refreshing to use a different toothbrush every day I bought them at a department store What are you going to do now? You haven't worked since we graduated last year Have you heard of a working holiday? No I read about it in the paper In Australia, they find you a job and teach you English for free - Sound good, don't you think? - Nonsense I guess they do it because they have a lot of land and not enough people You haven't experienced the work force yet It's not as easy as you think The biggest mistake I made in my twenty years is going to a business high school without thinking No one cares that I went to the best one in Inchon I have no regrets though It's brought me to my senses As soon as people see a flaw, they look down on you right away You always have to be on your toes Lose it for a second and you're... ...doomed, doomed These are our new colleagues, so let's make them feel welcome Yes, ma'am Haejoo, you wear glasses? You lost your contacts again, huh? Our two new recruits really brighten up the place Haejoo, get us some drinks Look at you, I almost didn't recognize you Your eyes look like two slants Oh, our drinks I can see well Looks like a dorm in here It used to be student housing Leave your shoes here It's amazing, I see more and more clearly after the laser surgery The cornea must be all protein, too When the laser burned it, it smelled like meat burning Now I can grow my nails I couldn't before because I'd rip my contacts all the time So you had surgery in order to grow your nails? Next time, I'll do my nose and widen my eyes a little I want to change myself as much as I can Taehee, sleep over You wouldn't leave a patient alone would you? It hurts The princess syndrome is also a disease after all Hello How many? This way, please - Let's sit by the window - Would you like sit over there? It's roomy over here Who cares about a window? What the hell? I don't know what I'm looking at - Excuse me - Yes? What's the different between Original, Red-hot, and Carolina Honey? This dish is made from ribs of six-month old piglets Red-hot is spicy and Carolina Honey is for those who like it sweet and sour Have you decided what you want? I have no idea You guys decide What's the most popular dish here? The Rib Sampler, you can enjoy all the different types of ribs Give us that Of course if it isn't good, you're responsible, okay? I don't trust this fancy crap When you don't know what to order, get the most popular dish It's a safe bet Dad, beating isn't the only form of violence Taking someone's freedom of choice is also a kind of violence No big man would stare at a dinky menu for so long A man who graciously eats what he gets will make it big, got it? Dad, don't worry I can eat anything Really? Everyone comes and goes but I'm always waiting People move and I sleep In that way, I feel as if I'm always asleep That all? I'm jealous It's really cool to finish something Now you'll leave me too, right? You always group people into those who stay or leave Then do you like me? Just because someone leaves you, it doesn't mean that they don't like you - Mom, what are you doing? - I'm heating up some herbal medicine - Why are you staring at it like that? - Do you want some, too? I just want to keep wandering around Just the thought of living in one place suffocates me On an endlessly sailing boat, living like flowing water Never stopping, like nomads Lying like this on a boat Watching clouds pass by while reading Then I'll build a wonderful country home by the river So come visit, okay? Get real. So that's why you're running away? Because of your scrooge dad? That's not even funny When did I say I'm leaving because of my dad? Only teenagers run away crying because they hate their parents That's too tacky I'm searching for a reason beyond that Oh, so profound Everyone leaves home because of family problems If they're happy and satisfied at home, why would they leave, right? Girls, how do I look? Pretty, right? - Looks great! - It looks good on you No need to spin around - Are you done? - Want to try it? Sure Here - Is it good? - Yeah Taehee, open the door for me - You try it, too - It's tastes so good Jiyoung? It's so cold It's freezing outside Slow down, talk with us No one's going to take it from you Whenever I see duk-bok-ki, it reminds me of when I met Taehee Why? Jiyoung and I were eating duk-bok-ki at a little joint Taehee was eating really aggressively just like this, all alone Really? I asked her why she was eating alone She really wanted duk-bok-ki, but the friend with her didn't That's why she was eating all mad So I invited her to eat with us You know you looked really silly then? - Do you like duk-bok-ki that much? - I do, too When my friend said she didn't like duk-bok-ki, I was totally devastated See, we were brought together by duk-bok-ki We're 'duk-bok-ki' buddies Have it all, Taehee Taehee one shot Taehee, spin Hurry and spin it One shot! - You guys... - I'm done, drink! - Heard about this? - What? Seeing your future husband on a full moon Let's go! Hurry up Jiyoung, help me - Why, Taehee? - Cigarettes Hey, slow down What's wrong? Something happen? Ohnjo dropped the mirror It's all right, it works better with a broken mirror Let's hurry up and start I got all the pieces Gather around You guys want to hear a story? A girl saw a bald man in the mirror and was so shocked that she dropped the knife on the mirror Later, she was set up on a blind date A bald man with a scar on his face was waiting for her You scared me. Why are you giving me the knife? Hey, don't drop it Hold it tight I hope he's handsome - What if it's Chanyong? - No way What's wrong with Chanyong? I think he's cute Stop it! Okay, close your eyes One, two, three... What's this? I knew this would happen That's strange. Maybe it's because you're not wearing a funeral dress - Maybe Haejoo's going to live alone - Come on! Do you guys really believe this crap? Oh, I have no feeling in my leg I should've let you try it on When you asked That's why you should try to be nicer Who's fault is this? How can we wait until morning like this? You troublemaker? - It's so cold - Who knew that the door would lock? Your damn cigarettes Why'd you move the shoe in the door? - So cold - Hey, I've got a great idea I'm not cold at all because I'm sweating. Come here and dig - No thanks - Come here It'd be nice if we all lived together on some tropical island Digging like this? Do you know how hard it is to live together? You have no clue You're excluded so don't worry Oh, my back hurts Are you still mad at me? I was wrong, okay? Loosen up I'm even finding a job for you Who do you think you are? I'm doing fine without your help - Jiyoung - What do you mean, doing fine? You've barely managed to find a job waiting tables What's so great about a job at a stock firm you got by pulling strings? I don't know how you see me, but I did my best to get there - At least, I don't live like you - Whats wrong with the way I live? - What do you know? - Please stop! 'I couldn't stay. See you later' - Ji-young - Jiyoung, where have you been? You poor thing, what are you going to do now? Charity Funeral Home Jiyoung, over here It's just a formality but since you're the sole surviving member, I need you to come with me to the station Peep, peep, little chick Bravo! Bravo! It's cold but you'll have to stay here for now. Sorry Just relax If you don't talk, it makes it more complicated, okay? Food's here - Thank you - Enjoy You must be hungry, have some Hey, blondie You must be happy the old folks are dead like you wanted Here, eat What! You brat! Is this your living room? Get up! - Are you here again? - I wanted to see you, teacher Suh Jiyoung If you don't speak, I have no choice but to send you to Juvenile Hall No one can speak for you, understand? Is it because you can't talk, or that you won't talk? Mother cries for me, but I cry for myself My body keeps sliding down Hey! Type faster, will you? I'm stuck to the floor, like a piece of gum Hey! Open the door Come on, open up Dad wants some dim sums, so go get some. - Later - He wants them now Then you go I'm studying - Go ask big brother - He's washing his kids - What about Mom? - She's on the phone I'm thinking right now That means you're free So, you go. You're the only one who's doing nothing She's still a minor and without a guardian So she's probably been transferred to Juvenile Classification Juvenile Classification? How do I get there? They probably don't allow minors to visit - Do you want me to make a call? - I'm not a minor Why wouldn't she talk? Who knows what she's thinking? I can't go What about work? Today? One sec Hello Bill is on the line for you Right now? Yes My friend says your English is good Can you help me out tonight? Yes Everyone else is taking college classes at night. What about you, Haejoo? I think I learn more by working I'll learn from you You've always made me feel like part of the team So I'm always happy to help you out Still, you need a degree You can't be a value-deficit all your life Who would do such a thing? Haejoo, fax this to headquarters Sorry, I cant go with you Have a good visit Say hi to Ji-young for me / Haejoo Haejoo sent you a text message Isn't there grass growing on your tongue from keeping so silent? It was just a formality for the cops But since you won't talk, the situation's worsening for you Get out quick Isn't it stuffy in there? Jiyoung? Even if you hack someone to death with an axe, I'd still be on your side There are reasons for everything I believe in you Even if I get out I have no place to go I don't know why you're so mad at me but it can't all be because of me In any case, don't be mad... Haejoo Haejoo, the manager's looking for you Are you okay? That's what work's all about Listen with one ear, and out the other, okay? Let's go Depending on the results, you get acknowledged and your value goes up That's the advantage Oh, wait a sec I shouldn't be sending you on a personal errand, sorry News flies quickly in our field If an analysis is decent, everyone knows about it instantly In that regard, it's worth going for Do you know the branch manager made me get coffee eleven times today? At least these days, the market's good When the market's bad, one of us is a coffee vending machine - Vending machines! - Shut up What's good is good Go back to sleep So what if we get coffee? Being so sensitive to stuff like that is sort of a complex That's why we're called value-deficits Why have you tagged along? You've never paid dues for our monthly gatherings That's right! Fine, I'll leave then You're really leaving? I'm really going We're only going to stop you once Sit down Don't hate me too much I'm taking these cigarettes I bought them with my money Hey, pay the bill Bye See you Hey, Haejoo Hey, Chanyong Are you going to come every time I call? Very interesting Are you okay? What? I'm going to kiss you because you're so nice Pull yourself together, woman Why? Hey! A cat at the animal shelter was found eaten by other wild cats Is the wild nature of these wild cats reaching an extreme? But still, it can happen if you're hungry Right, if you're hungry, then eat me You said to eat you Who could it be? Who is it? Taehee, what's up? Who? Oh, Taehee Glad to... Why the cat? Let's shake I gave Titi to Biryu and Ohnjo They'll take good care of her Since graduating last year, I worked for my dad for free I asked around how much I would've made and I took just that amount Where are you going to go? We'll think about it on the way I thought it'd be better with you than going alone
