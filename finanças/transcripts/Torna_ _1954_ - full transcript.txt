COME BACK! Wait for me. I don't know how long I'll be. Mr. Varesi? Antonio Mezzara, the family attorney. We've been waiting. - I came straight from the airport. - You can stay here, if you like. - I prefer to stay in town. As you think best. Finally! I've looked forward to meeting you. I'm Giacomo. Forgive me. I don’t know the family tree. My father, your mother and Uncle Ernesto were siblings. We should use first names. We're cousins. This is Mr. Sarelli. - A pleasure. - Likewise. - Everyone here? - Except the young lady. I'm sure she's ready. Michele, ask the young lady to come down. - Another relative? - A distant one. She was orphaned as a child, and Uncle Ernesto took her in. He was very fond of her. This is Roberto Varesi, our cousin. Have a seat, Susanna. Please. The will of the deceased, Ernesto Marini, dated March 23, 1948. "Being of sound mind, I, Ernesto Marini, hereby dispose that all my possessions shall be divided in three equal parts among my nephew Giacomo, son of my deceased brother Corrado, my beloved niece Susanna, whom I've loved as a daughter, and my nephew Roberto, son of my pitiable sister Luisa. He mustn’t be held responsible for his mother's mistakes, and I therefore recognize him as a legitimate heir. I furthermore bequeath 500,000 lira each to my servant, Aurelio Moresi, my maid, Rosina Venturelli, and my gardener, Vittorio Santarini, who served me faithfully for so many years. I appoint Antonio Mezzara to be executor of this will." If there are no objections, this will is hereby valid and binding. It will be my duty to carry out the formalities indicated. Just a minute. Please indicate that I hereby refuse my part. I won't accept an inheritance granted in language that denigrates my mother's memory. - But that's your interpretation -- - No, please. My mind is made up. Surely I can't be forced to accept it. No, you have every right to refuse. Very well. Can I sign all necessary papers before tomorrow evening? Certainly. Stop by my office tomorrow. Gentlemen. - Miss. - No, please wait a moment. I'd like to speak with Mr. Varesi alone. I don't want you to leave with any animosity toward Uncle Ernesto. No, no animosity or resentment. Just indifference. He ignored my existence all his life and in death only flaunted his hatred for my mother. That's not true! You must know the truth. I lived with him all my life. I can tell you. He didn't hate your mother. My mother had her pride too. She faced a thousand obstacles and never asked for his help. He helped her just the same, without her knowing it. What? What do you mean? He helped her constantly, unbeknownst to her. He kept informed of all she did, suffered her sorrows, and shared her joys. It can't be. You don't believe me? Come with me. Look here. Bills, letters, and pictures. Look. This is you as a child. I don't know how he got these pictures, but he was very fond of them. There are lots of others. My uncle was very proud of you. Why didn't you ever tell me? I wanted to. We crossed paths once, and I wanted to tell you everything. We did? When? At your mother’s grave on All Souls' Day. Like every year, I'd brought flowers from Uncle Ernesto, and when I saw you -- You're still here? I thought your little talk was over. Should I go? No, stay. All this is quite unsettling. We must speak again. - Whenever you like. Thank you. - Shall I show you out? - I know the way. It seems our cousin made quite an impression on you. - What are you implying? - Oh, nothing. I'd love to know the mysterious motive for your talk. It was my duty to inform him of certain things. - Like what? - They don't concern you. Fine. I won't insist. Do you like him? I neither like nor dislike him. The classic stalwart gentleman, serious and hard-working. The captain of industry who "breaks but never bends." I heartily detest him. - You hardly spoke to him. - It was enough. And he detests me too. We understood each other immediately. But let's not talk about him. Let's talk about us... about you. Please, not now. Why not now? Remember: It was right here that I asked you to be my wife. You wanted some time to think. Then Uncle Ernesto fell ill and died. I respected your grief and waited. Can you give me your answer now? Yes, Giacomo. I’m sorry it's not the answer you’d prefer. You won't marry me? - I can't. - Why not? Do you love another? No, I don't love another, but I don't love you either. I'm sorry, but I must be honest. Have you forgotten everything we shared? Don't speak to me of the past. There's no point. I still have your letters. You can't deny what you wrote. I’m not denying anything, but I was little more than a girl. Now I'm a woman who knows her own mind. I have very fond feelings for you... but I don't love you. Thanks so much. I don't care about your fond feelings. I love you. I love you madly. I need you. The idea of losing you drives me mad. - Let me go. - No. You know there's something binding us forever. You can't have forgotten our kisses. No, don't push me away. You’re not afraid of me but of yourself. Afraid I'll kiss you and you won't be able to resist. Isn't that true? Leave me alone. I beg you. Now go. Please sit down. These figures sum up the whole situation. The villa is heavily mortgaged, and the shipyard's essentially inactive. Selling the land wouldn't cover the debts. How did this happen? It's been an unpleasant surprise for everyone. - So the inheritance is worthless? - Worse. Has Miss Susanna been informed? Not yet, but I asked Giacomo to tell her... an unpleasant task. With her uncle she lived a life of comfort, and now suddenly... I see. May I take those papers? Certainly. I'd like to have a closer look. May I visit the shipyard? - Anytime you like. Here's our captain of industry. Hello. Forgive me for letting myself in. There was no one around. - Hello, cousin. - Ah, you're here too. Yes, I'm here too. Sorry I couldn't come earlier. I made a very informative visit to the shipyard. And you've come to offer condolences? Susanna, I'm here for your sake. It seems your financial situation has turned extremely precarious. Don't worry about me. I don't need anything. My mother left me a few jewels. They're not of great value, but it will see me through for now. And then what? Then... I'll see. I’ll earn a living somehow, like every other girl with no money. Don't you think I can? - Of course. It just saddens me to have to leave this house. I grew up here and spent the happiest years of my life here. If it pains you that much to give it up, we could try to save it. - Save it? - How? It wouldn't be easy, but it's worth a try. The shipyard's in a terrible state, but the facilities are in working order, the equipment's still functional, and there's an inventory of very valuable raw material. That shipyard was the ruin of Uncle Ernesto. Could the shipyard really save the house? I'm afraid it might be a foolhardy venture. I won't pretend otherwise, but I have my hopes. If you two agree, we can accept the inheritance. It's a bold and risky plan. It calls for courage and a willingness to work hard. I'm ready to try it. Well, I have little courage, even less taste for hard work, and no desire to get mixed up in more problems. Then do you want to renounce your part? As soon as possible. Life's funny, isn't it? Yesterday you renounced your part. Today it's my turn. - What about you? - I think you're right. It's obvious you two see things the same way. You both like selfless, melodramatic gestures. I'm more of a realist. I prefer to risk what little I have at roulette, where it's do or die. All we can do now is wish each other good luck. No more bets. Twenty-nine black, odd. Place your bets. Fifteen thousand in chips. No more bets. Twenty black, even. First red, odd. Bad luck? Awful. This is all I have left. I have nothing left. Shall I play for you? I'm lucky playing for other people. Sure, give it a try. - Eighteen. - No more bets. Eighteen red, even. We won! Well done! Try again. Do we want to risk it all? Sure, let's risk it all. Eighteen red, even. I’ll give you the rest in cashier's checks. Good. I don't know where to put all this. Here you are, and congratulations. We haven't seen a win like this in years. I hope I don't end up giving it all back. For you. - Thank you. We won an enormous sum. Incredible! Now let's split it up. - It was your money. Only at first. You doubled it many times over. You were extraordinary. Not a single bad bet. I told you: I'm lucky gambling with other people's money. Yes, it's odd. You'd lost until we joined forces. Perhaps fate’s telling us something. - Like what? - That perhaps we should continue. Not a bad idea. Allow me to introduce myself. Oh, I know who you are. A girlfriend told me about you. - Good things, I hope. - No, horrible. That's why you interest me. My name is Viviana Saderi. I'm all alone... and bored. I'm alone too, so let's be alone together. It will bring us luck. At the gambling table? And everywhere else, I hope. I don't get it. We should be there by now. You're so impatient. Someone waiting for you? No, but it's natural to want to see one's hometown after so many months. How long will we stay? I don't know. I haven't decided. I don't like to make plans. Besides, you wanted a little rest too, right? Yes... but not here. Your hometown frightens me. - Why? All your life and all your past is there. Everything I don't know about you. - Oh, stop it. But you know everything about me. I've kept nothing from you. And you also know that my life truly began only when I met you. We're finally here. Mr. Varesi? I don't know where he is. Try in the office. Over there to the right. MANAGEMENT Excuse me. May I speak to... Susanna! Just who I came to see. I didn't imagine I'd find you here. You're a typist now? - I help in the office. Where have you been all this time? Here and there, traveling the world. I called the villa, but I didn't recognize the voice. - It's rented out. - Where do you live? In the gardener's house. That's a step down. How'd the inheritance turn out? We've paid off some debt and got extra time from creditors. - Did you sell your mother's jewels? - Of course. And Roberto invested everything he had to get the shipyard running again. Fortunately, the worst is past. Congratulations. Are you happy? Very. How admirable. Living in the gardener's house, typing letters... did Roberto demand all these sacrifices? I took them on myself. And in your spare time you darn his socks and do his wash? Excuse me. I have a letter to finish. Roberto's out in the shipyard. I have no desire to see him. I prefer to stay here with you. You mind? Have a seat. It's a shame seeing those lovely hands worn down on a typewriter. Listen to me. Don't look at me like I'm the enemy. It's been almost two years since we last spoke, and all I’ve done is think of you. I tried to forget, but I couldn't. I can’t live without you. - Let me go, please. It can't be over between us. It would be a horrible shame. You loved me. And in the name of that love, stop thinking about me. I can't! It's an obsession, a madness. I can't shake it. I have lots of money now. I've had an incredible run of luck. Come away with me. I'll give you everything. But you must be mine. - Stop it! Every word you say is an insult. Try to understand. You don't have to love me. Just let me love you. Perhaps with time you'd... It will keep my hope alive. Don't insist. It's no use. - You love someone else? - Yes. Roberto? He's asked me to marry him, and I said yes. I could see you were made for each other. Love among the unpaid bills... very touching. But watch out! I'll forget you one day, because hatred wipes out memories, but you'll never forget me. What we shared will always stand between you two. You can deny it but you can't change it, so beware. Your threats don't frighten me. I can always prove my innocence. I'm the only one who can do that, but you'd be wise not to call on me as a witness. Why? You mean... I'll do anything! I won't give you up. I can't stop you from marrying Roberto, but my only aim in life will be to destroy your happiness. - Get out of here! - Yes, I'll go. But if I come back one day, it will mean I've come to keep my promise. Good-bye. All right. Come by the office this afternoon. - We'll be ready ahead of schedule. - Really? We've worked like mules, but we had to. It's our first triumph. The San Giorgio will sail in a month. Really? That will be a great day for the workers. And especially for you and me. Don’t forget our vow that the day our first vessel sailed, we'd be married. We’ve suffered and struggled. I almost gave up sometimes, but you gave me the strength to keep going. I'll always be at your side. There will be more obstacles, but don't be afraid. We'll overcome them together. I'm not afraid with you, Roberto. - Anyone come by to see me? - No. A workman said some fellow was here asking for me. Yes, I forgot. Giacomo stopped by. - Your cousin? - Yes. He'd have said hi, but... And you didn't tell me? It slipped my mind. He only stayed a minute. He's leaving again. - I see. Is this letter all right? What's wrong? Nothing. Why? I don't know. Something's upset you. No, nothing. I promise. Good. But remember: We mustn't have any secrets. Why do you say that? No reason. Perhaps I just love you too much and always fear you have secrets I don't know about. The manager called. He has a nicer room for us. What do I care? - You wanted it. - Well, now I don't. Pack up. We're leaving tonight. You object? No. As you wish. I just began unpacking, but I'll start repacking. Where are we going? - Back to Cannes for now. Now blow them all out in one breath. Here's your chance. Ready? Yes, Daddy. Watch how good I am. Go on! One more. And now serve some cake to your friends. Maria, help her. Don’t worry. There's plenty. - No, ladies first. - Hear what Mommy said? Be patient, Maurizio. We men must always let the ladies go first. Don't worry. We have two more cakes. Drink your chocolate. Give that to Bruno. Remember when we lit her first candle? How the years have flown. You're wanted on the phone, sir. - Who is it? - The shipyard. Can't they leave you a moment's peace? Say you're not here. It might be important. Excuse me. Hello. Speaking. What's that? Who is this? Of course I'm surprised after all this time. What? Right now? I don't understand. All right. If it's really necessary. I'll be right there. All right. Lidia brought you some cake. - For you, Daddy. - Thanks. I'll eat it later. Daddy has to go to the office. Why are you crying? You can't go. It's my birthday. You have to stay with me. Let's not have any tears in those beautiful eyes. I'll be back right away. - So you still love me? Yes, very much. - You said you'd be free this afternoon. - I know. But guess who’s waiting for me. Giacomo. He insisted that he had to speak to me. No, don't go. But I already promised. - What's he want? - I don't know. I really can't imagine, but I'll find out. Anyway, I'll hurry. Be good. Hello, cousin. Happy to see you. - Me too. - Congratulations. Happy? - Very. I see you've expanded. You're obviously a clever man. It wasn't cleverness, but courage and hard work. If you'd wanted to... - Heavens, no! Better for you and me both. You had the courage and will to work hard. Yet without either of those, I'll end up achieving the same result. - I don't understand. - You will soon. Shall we sit down? - Please. Are you the majority shareholder? Yes. Including'Susanna's shares, of course. That’s what I wanted to know before making my offer. What offer? I have a lot of money on hand. I thought I'd become your partner. - So what happened? - Nothing. Why are you so on edge? You've never been this late, and running off like that... You want to know what Giacomo said? Of course. What does he want? The most grotesque and ridiculous thing you could imagine: He wants to be my partner. - Your partner? Yes. That's what he had the nerve to tell me. And even more grotesque and ridiculous yet: I have to agree to it. - Why? He bought up all minority shares. But that's not all. He insists he never gave up his share of the inheritance and that he can therefore lay claim to it. Combining all those shares, he'd become the majority shareholder. But what can he do to us? What can he do? He can ruin me. Right when I need all the credit I can muster. He threatens to subpoena me, get injunctions against me. Imagine the consequences. It's a disaster! That's his blackmail: either my partner or my enemy. What was your answer? I asked fof three days to decide. I'm going to speak to a bank manager. If he grants me the funds, I'll pay Giacomo off tomorrow and send him packing. Otherwise... we have no choice. We must meet his demands. Your suitcase is ready in the car. I'm coming. Good-bye. Good luck. You became very agitated when I mentioned Giacomo. I've never seen you so on edge. Like you had some kind of premonition. Yes, perhaps it's a premonition. - Mr. Marini, please. - Your name? Tell him his cousin Susanna is here. - You wished to see Mr. Marini? - Yes. I heard he was staying here. I'm his cousin. I know. But Mr. Marini isn't in. But he told the front desk he'd be right down. I told the front desk that. You did? Why? Because I've wanted to meet you for a long time now. You're not upset? No, but I don't understand. Please sit down. I'm Giacomo's girlfriend. I've lived with him for five years now. That should explain my curiosity. I saw a picture of you once. Women are usually prettier in pictures than in real life, but not you. You're much more beautiful in person. Thank you. You’re very kind. But now, if you don't mind... You wish to leave? Why? Are you in such a hurry? You're disappointed not to see Giacomo, but you and I could have things to discuss, couldn't we? I don't know. At least, I don't think so. I think we do. Perhaps you... So the concierge was right. Have you been waiting long? - A few minutes. Why are you here? I kept her company in your absence. Fine. You can go now. Too bad. You walked in too soon. Our conversation was just getting interesting. Go now, please. Forgive me. I never expected you to come by. - Just what are you trying to do? - Trying to do? I don't understand, my dear. You understand perfectly. Roberto told me all about your offer and your blackmail. What an ugly word! I want to be his partner... an expression of esteem. You threatened to ruin him. When I want something, I make sure I can get it. What do you want to get? I remember what you said last time we met: You'd do everything to destroy our happiness. Very good. I'm pleased to see you haven't forgotten. - Is that why you came back? - You guessed right. And now I can kick you both out in the street. Then why not do it? Poverty doesn't frighten us. We've seen hard times, and we're ready to face them again. Don't worry. I won't disturb your comfortable life. I have something better in mind. - What? Think I'd be so foolish as to tell you? You'll see. Why do you hate us so? I couldn't stop you from marrying the man you love, but you can't stop me from hating him. Just what are you planning? What do you think this ridiculous hatred will get you? I want to take you from him, and I'll do it. You're wrong. No matter what vile deeds you carry out against us, you'll never take me away from him. So do what you like. Vent all your hatred. I'm not afraid of you. - Who signs first? - You. You own more shares. If you have any objection... No, no objection. So now we're partners. Another tie that binds us, besides the others. - What others? - Family ties, of course. And who knows? Perhaps the same tastes. I mean, the same taste in cigarettes. May I? I hope I can stop in now and then. It's your right. No, I trust you. Carry on as usual. No, you have duties, rights, and responsibilities now. Forcing me to work... is that your revenge? May I say hello to Susanna? - Of course. I'll see if she's home. Isn't Daddy here? He stepped out, but he'll be right back. Who are you? A friend of your daddy's. What's your name? - Lidia. What's yours? Mine is... How are you? - Fine. And you? Oh, you know... can’t complain. Sweet kid. We introduced ourselves. How old are your? - This old. A hand minus one finger. Four. Hard to believe. We last saw each before you got married, right, Susanna? Five or six years ago. When the issues about the inheritance came up. - Right. - No, you're wrong. Susanna said you dropped by the shipyard once. Oh, right. It slipped my mind. Now I remember. By the way, is the villa still rented out? No, we use it when the weather's nice. I'd love to go see it. May I? - Of course. - Is the same groundskeeper there? Good. I'll get to say hello to him too. Well, see you soon. III show you out. - Good-bye. - See you soon. Mommy, will you read to me about the forest? Yes, sweetheart. - Did you sign? - Yes. I was forced to meet his demands. Did you tell him we'd rented out the villa? Maybe. I don't remember. Strange how he forgot he came by the shipyard once. Or he was pretending he forgot. Why do you say that? You never know what he's really thinking. And you forgot too. Yes, but it was so long ago. I understand. Lidiuccia, let's read together. Here I am, darling. Shall we? - I should say! Haven't we been here long enough? - Bye, Vittorio. - Sir... ma'am. Are you angry? Upset I took you to my uncle's villa? I'm the sentimental type. You went there often? Of course. To see my uncle. - No, you went to see her. - Yes, also to see her. No, not also. Especially. You loved her. It's true. What about it? - And you still do. - Maybe. So you admit it! I don't admit it or deny it. It's none of your business. Just what am I to you? Nothing... less than nothing. I'd be upset if you weren't jealous. Why? Does my jealousy flatter your ego? Sure. Besides... it just might come in handy. Handy for what? Nothing. Don't mind me. Just kidding. I came just as you asked. What do you want? Why did you send that note? Won't you sit down for a moment? I hope you can explain your mysterious message. Your wife is having a tête-à-tête with another man this very moment. Don't talk rubbish! Who is this? The Caffe Riviera? Hello? I told you before: Come away with me. Are you mad? Maybe I am. But you must be mine and mine alone. I felt sorry for you before. Now I feel only loathing and contempt. I don't care. I still want you. And if you don't leave Roberto, he'll leave you. What do you mean? You won't act so haughty when he kicks you out. The same blackmail as always, your surefire weapon. Well, I'll tell Roberto everything myself. Too late. Certain confessions are dangerous too long after the deed. The most innocent things can look suspicious. For example, your letters. - What letters? From when you were in love with me. I've kept them all. What could they matter? I was a foolish, romantic girl. Roberto would be the first to laugh. Sure, if they were dated, but they're not. They could have been written yesterday or today. This one, for example. I suspect your handwriting hasn't changed. Shall I read it to you? Perhaps you don't remember. "My love, don't be impatient. I wish I could always be with you too, but we must be careful. Let's wait until he leaves on shipyard business. Then we can spend every day together. I love you – Susanna." What do you think? "He" referred to Uncle Ernesto, but it could also refer to Roberto. And I have lots more like this. So that's your plan: to play on those ambiguities. Well, you’re out of luck. I have your letters too. He'd only have to compare them. Enough! I won't listen to another word. You disgust me! - Looking for someone, sir? - No, thank you. "My love, don't be impatient. I wish I could always be with you too, but we must be careful. Let's wait until he leaves on shipyard business. Then we can spend every day together." RECOGNIZE YOUR WIFE'S HANDWRITING? Daddy, it's Lidia. I had to tell you that my doll broke. Really? Sorry to hear that. That's terrible. What should we do? Buy another one? All right. What's that? With blond hair? All right. We'll find one with blond hair. I didn't want to disturb you, sweetheart, but Lidia insisted. Yes, Daddy, I did. I'm glad you did. I have a lot of work. I may be home late. What's that? Tomorrow night? No, I can't. I'm leaving tomorrow. I don't know. Two or three days. Depends how business goes. See you later. Why don't you want me to come to the station? No, you stay with Lidia. I'll be back in a few days anyway. - Wire me when you get there. - There's no point. I’ll write. Good-bye. You'd go off like that? Have a good trip. Thanks. Your little cousin's coming tomorrow. But now you have to go beddy-bye. - Phone for you, ma'am. - Who is it? - Vittorio, at the villa. - What does he want? I don't know. He says it's urgent. Hello? Yes, Vittorio. What is it? I found some papers in the basement. Behind some furniture. I don't know. Perhaps you should come get them. When? Very good, ma'am. - What did she say? - She'll be here soon. But why have me tell a lie like that? I told you: It's a joke. Now go look after your flowers. - And when madame arrives? - I'll be here. We'll call if we need you. Here. I forgot. - What's that for? Get yourself some cigarettes. You can go now. Vittorio's not here, but I am. - You! - That's right. Didn't expect me, did you? It's my fate to be always surprising you. You came for those precious papers, but instead you find me. Let's come to an agreement. - Out of my way. Well! Such manners! You think I would set this whole thing up... for nothing? Now that you're here, stay a while. We're all alone. Let me by! You're so beautiful full of hatred and contempt. That’s all I can expect now: hatred and contempt. But I want you anyway... and I'll have you! Let me go! Get out! Get out! You stay there. At your service. Leave. We'll talk later. - Let me explain. Go home. It's just you and me now. Let’s hear it. I want to know. - What? Everything! How long has this affair gone on? Ask Susanna. A gentleman never talks. Don't try to be funny! Talk! How long? - Figure it out yourself. What does that mean? That she was your lover when I met her and continued to be after our marriage? Is that it? Talk, damn it! We've always loved each other and still do. Did you think she married you for love? Poor chump. We needed someone to revive the shipyard, and you came along: the great captain of industry to the rescue. She played you for a fool, and with the shipyard running again, I came for my share. If you weren't blinded by your pride and trust, you’d have caught on long ago, but you were too sure of yourself. Go on. Haven't heard enough? I bet you still don't believe it. She'll deny it all, of course. Women always do. She'll say she's innocent, that she loves you. And you’ll believe her, and everything will be like before. Stop it! Now I'm the one who wants to go on. How I enjoy seeing you suffer and tremble with rage! It was like swallowing poison knowing she was in your arms, but she wasn't yours! She was never yours. She's always loved me. And the little girl isn’t yours either. What? What do you mean? - She isn't yours either. She was born of our love. It's not true! You're lying! It's the truth. She's my daughter. You gave her your name, but I gave her life! Just look at her hair, her eyes. Take a good look! You're lying. You're lying, you swine! Swine! Help him up. Mommy, what's wrong? Why are you crying? It's nothing, sweetheart. Hello? Mr. Marini, please. He's not here. How can that be? The concierge told me he was in. Please let me speak to him. It's urgent. I said he’s not in. The concierge was mistaken. I'm sorry. Good night. Who was that? No one. Wrong number. Mr. Marini, please. It's urgent. He should be in. ma'am. Would you call him? Tell him it's Mrs. Varesi and... Giacomo! Listen, you better explain... Let's go in there. - Where's Roberto? - Would I know if you don't? I don’t know anything. He's not home or at the shipyard. I'm going crazyl What happened between you two? What happened? Look. Roberto has a mean right hook. He nearly killed me. You mean he really believed that you and I... Of course. He caught you in my arms. It all followed the classic plot: the feigned departure, the covert pursuit, the moment of surprise. Thank God it didn't end with the classic gunshot. He just pummeled me with his fists. Unpleasant, but I prefer it. Didn't you tell him the truth? - What truth? - That there's nothing between us. That you lured me here with a despicable lie! That truth suits you, but not me. I told you: I want Roberto to think you're unfaithful and leave you for good. If you won't be mine, you won't be his either. Would you really be that vile? I told you I'd do anything. I risked everything. If he'd had a gun, he'd have killed me. But it's not true! I know that, but what does it matter? I also told him your daughter is our child. No, you couldn't have! I turned him against her too. Now he'll detest you and her! The truth? Truth is whatever people believe. And he believes me! Curse you! God will punish you. He's just. He sees everything and doesn't forgive! - What are you doing here? - Nothing. Just waiting for you two to finish talking. - Did you hear what we said? - Of course. Every word. Then you'd better forget it. Say one word and you'll be sorry, you hear? Get up and get dressed. Look at me. What's wrong? Look at me. What have I done? Go away. Meanie! You're a bad man. I don't love you. You're not my daddy anymore. Dress her and bring her down the back stairs. - At this hour? - Just do it, and hurry up. I'll be waiting downstairs. Make it quick. Come here, sweetheart. Don't cry. So you're here. Just as well. Saves me the trouble of writing a letter. A letter? Why? What are you going to do? Punish you like you deserve. Wait! Before you decide anything, hear me out. Giacomo lied. I swear I've done nothing wrong. - Let me go. - No, you must listen! I have the right to explain. You can't destroy my life like this... and our daughter's! Your daughter. And you'll never see her again. That's the punishment you deserve. - What do you plan to do? - You'll see. Wait, before it's too late! My little girl! My little girl! Antonia. No one's here. Antonia! I'm coming. Who is it? Signor Roberto! How are you? Fine, thanks. What a nice surprise. Take her to your room. Try not to wake her up. A lovely little girl. Your daughter? Do as I say, and call your husband. I need to speak to you. You're trustworthy people. I can rely on you. There's no point explaining my actions. The child is to stay here for now, and no one's to know. Not even her mother? Not even her mother. Especially her mother. How do we keep her hidden? What if someone sees her? Say she's a relative's daughter who's staying with you for a while. If the child asks questions, say her mother will come for her soon. Poor little thing. I'm sorry. We thought you were very happy. I know. She's not my daughter. She was born of their illicit love. It’s my right to take her away. No, you have no such right. No law allows you to take a child from its mother. - Even the child of an illicit love? - That's right. You can't take her away just to get revenge. No law gives you that right. I don’t care. I'll make my own laws. Should I file for a separation and let the three of them have a good time? No, forget it. They have to pay. They're never to see the child. And who do you think you'll hurt this way? Both of them, but especially her. You're wrong. The real victim of your vengeance will be the child. - Too bad. - Yes, too bad. What has that poor child done? How will she grow up? Like an abandoned waif, nobody's child. Her life will be destroyed. Are you willing to bear that responsibility? I can't stand to look at her anymore. But you still love her. You can't deny it. Certain feelings can't be destroyed overnight. She's in your blood and in your heart. Only years of hatred could change that. Enough! You're being severely tested, Roberto, but it's trials like these that reveal a man's true character. I'm not saying to give the child back to her mother but to provide a mother for your daughter! - My daughter... - Yes, your daughter! Children belong to those who've loved them, raised them, and suffered for them. You'll find her here. Tell her mother to go get her. Please make all arrangements. Here. I don't want to see anyone. This train's so slow. It'll never get there. These local trains have old locomotives. Will we catch our coach? Certainly. Don't worry. We'll be there by evening. Stop! You can't go any further! There's a landslide! Everyone out, please. A landslide has blocked the road. We can't proceed until tomorrow morning. Come along, ma'am. No, I don't want to wait. We must be close. I'll walk. Impossible! It's over 12 miles! It's almost nightfall, and with this weather... We'll find lodging here tonight. I can’t waitl Every hour that goes by is unbearable! I understand, but we must be patient. You'll rest while I make arrangements for tomorrow. - No, I'll walk there. - No, come with me. Poor thing... calling out for her mother even in her dreams. Poor, innocent thing. What kind of mother would do this? Martino, come with us. There's a landslide at the crossroads. We're rounding up all the men. If it blocks the stream, we’re all in trouble. I'll be ready in a minute. Have some wine. - We never say no to that. - Anyone buried in the landslide? - Let's hope not. My Pinuccia's out there. She's calling me. - You're here too, Luisa? - Of course. She heard "landslide" and started following us. She's buried out there. I have to come along. Who is she? What does she want? Ah, right. You're new around here. She lost her only daughter in a landslide years ago. The daughter was never found, and she went crazy. No, I'm not crazy. My Pinuccia is buried out there. She's calling me. She's alive. I'm ready. Let's go. Good night, Antonia. Stop following us! You stay here this time. It’s at the crossroads, far away. Pinuccia couldn't have gotten that far. No, I have to go. I must look for her. You can go later. Rest a while. That's it. Here. Drink this. - Mommy! - It's all right. She's calling me. She's here. She's calling me. I'm scared. I want my mommy. All right, if you'll go back to sleep. Close the window. The lightning will come in. Landslide! Help! Pinuccia! She's calling me! She’s close by! I knew it! I have to hurry and dig her out! She's can't breathe! She has to be here! Pinuccia, call out! I found her! Try to get a hold of yourself. He killed my daughter! He killed her! You have to be strong. My poor little girl. He killed her! You! I have some news you'll be happy to hear. That's why I came in person. Our little girl is dead! It's not true. She's dead! And you killed her! You should have killed me... not her! She was so small... so weak and helpless! Murderer! Mommy, I'm scared! Help! I'm scared! I'm your mommy. I saved you. Don't you remember? Look at me. Look at me! The concierge didn't get tickets. He said'you've delayed our departure. Just can't do it, can you? You can't forget her. Stop thinking about her! What are you hoping for? She doesn't love you. She loved me once. You always remember your first love Not her. There's the dead child between you now. Good! One less obstacle. You're a monster! You agreed to our deal when it suited you. Don't forget it now. You should have known long ago that it was over. Over! Over... Don't leave me, I beg you! Don't go! If you leave me, I'll do something foolish. I'll do something foolish. Don’t make a scene. You lose control and don't know what you're saying. Try and leave me with a pleasant memory. Front desk? Prepare my bill. I'll be leaving right away. No, she'll be staying. I'll be leaving alone. - Let me go! - You've lost your mind! Give me that gun! - Let me go! Help me! It was an accident. An accident. I went to unload it and it went off. Thank God you got here in time. He keeps asking for you. - Is it very serious? - Yes, they couldn't even operate. Come closer. He wants to talk to you. Thank you for coming. I want you to know... that I lied about everything. What? No, don't interrupt. I have little time left, and I want to tell you everything. Not for your sake. For Susanna's. I don't want to leave her unhappy. I've behaved despicably... but the hurt I caused her was because I loved her so much. But she loves you and you alone. But what about the letters? They were from long ago. You'll find the rest among my papers. Read them and you'll see. That incident at the villa was all a ruse. Ask the gardener. I had him call. What about... the child? With God as my witness I swear: I lied. Forgive me. Forgive me! My daughter. My little girl. Wait here. Be a good girl. Don't leave me alone. There's nothing left to eat. You want to starve? Let me go and find something. I’ll bring you some chestnuts, and we'll roast them. You like chestnuts? I don't want to be alone. I'm afraid. Mommy! I'm your mommy. You've been with me long enough now. Why don’t you recognize me? No, you're not my mommy. My Pinuccia... you were buried under the earth. Don't you remember? You called out for me. Look at my fingers all scratched and cut. I'm afraid. Then I'll tie you up! Come here. Sit still. We found my poor wife's body at the base of the cliff, but the stream probably carried the child off. It can take years to find the victims of a landslide. I mean to find her right away. That's why I've come. I'll be back tomorrow. Gather men and equipment, and spare no expense. All right. I loved the child too. It broke my heart to hear her calling for her daddy and mommy. Her daddy and mommy... How is your wife? Sorry if I'm intruding, but sorrows are easier to bear as a couple. If you love each other, there's always hope. No, there's nothing left for me. Nothing. Don't say that. We all have hard times, but life always has something in store. Listen to this old man. I've seen lots of hard times, and still... Luisa! - Who's that? - I've been looking for her. She was in my house that night. Poor woman's half crazy. Maybe she can tell us something. Wait! Don't be afraid! Remember the pretty blond girl at my house? This is her father. Pinuccia. My Pinuccia! Wait! Don't run off! Let her go. I'll talk to her tomorrow. No, better to ask her now. What’s her name? Luisa, wait! Let's go back. It’s a waste of time. - I want to talk to her now. - It's no use. We have to get away. Where are you taking me? I don't want to go! You look over there. I'll look in here. Lidia! You're alive! Your daddy's here. Who are you? What are you doing with my daughter? She's mine! Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Martino! Take this crazy woman away! Luisa, what have you done? Let me look at you. Did she hurt you? Daddy's here now. Say something for your daddy. What did she do to you? We'll go find Mommy. Take me to Mommy. I’m scared. Yes, we'll find Mommy. We'll never leave you again. You'll always be with Daddy and Mommy. She hurt you, didn't she? Imagine you've had a terrible nightmare. Many times we dream that our loved ones are gone forever, but then we wake up and find that nothing's changed, that everything's like before. I don't believe in miracles. But you must, Susanna! In fact, it's a miracle your Lidia was spared in that landslide. - What? It's a miracle she's alive and healthy and wants only to embrace her mother. It's true. Lidia is much closer than you can imagine. So close that... Look. Come in. Here's the miracle. My little girl. Mommy, never leave me again. We'll always be together. Always. Sweetheart. Let's leave them alone. Daddy saved me and brought me home. I was so scared. That evil woman stole me away. She tied me up and said she was my mommy. How could she be my mommy? You're my mommy. No one else. My sweet, beautiful mommy. Forgive me. All that matters is that you've come back.
