This view's gonna be amazing. - I have a surprise for you. - What's that? Close your eyes. Open them. Will you marry... Yes. Where did you go? This isn't funny, Todd. Where are you? Where are you? Help! Anyone! Can you help? Please, help me! Please. Todd. All right. That's the last one. Please tell me the mooring's intact. Looks fine. The earthquake didn't cause any visible cracks. All right. Great. I get to stay above water today. Another chance for me to teach your uncle how it's done. Whatever. Hey, Ray, if you're not getting any bites, let's pull it in. Never want to stay in the same spot too long. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, man. What if this is the spot, Hunter? Come on. Slow and steady. That's the McCray way. Maybe too slow and too steady is the reason why you still haven't caught the big one, Uncle Ray. Yeah, Ray, what about that big one? Hey, keep on. Keep on. I'm gonna show both of y'all. Just keep on. We're gonna miss you. Are you sure you won't reconsider? Look around, Hunter. This? This is heaven, baby. You ain't gonna find anything better than this. I'm not gonna pretend I haven't become fond of this place. And us? That's not the issue. What do they think they're doing? Besides working my last nerve? I think they breaking every maritime law there is. That's why some people should stay on the shore. Yeah, they got fools over there too, Hunter. That, my friend, is why I live on a boat. I smell a teachable moment coming. Mm-hmm. Me too. Whoo. Come on. Move the clown car over here. Move it. Move it. Who the hell are you? - Adult supervision. - Thanks, pops. You know, I think we got it from here, though. From here, I don't see one person that could pass a field sobriety test. Harbor master, boy. Hand over them fireworks. Do you have any idea how much I spent on these? Not as much as you're gonna have to pay the tourist police if I turn you in. Whatever. Have fun. I took this off him. Get your boat fixed. See? He's cool. Cheers to Mr. Tik. You see the look on the kid's face when you took his fireworks? Priceless. You better grab that pole, Ray, before it's gone. Oh, shi... Come on. Ooh, I got it. It's the big one! - I got it. I got it this time. - Come on. - Almost, almost, almost. - Easy. - Come on. Here's a big one. - I got it! I got it! What's that? Fires? Dead bodies? I'm gonna have to start taking my blood pressure medicine before I leave the dock. He's been in the water a long time. You guys need to look at this. Maybe that's where the body came from. That's not good. I'm gonna call the authorities. Let's head in. I'm gonna pull the drone. I'ma cover his ugly ass up. Could this be an algae bloom? Yeah, maybe if we were in the Caribbean. Not in these waters, though. Uncle Ray? Get off my niece! Hell is wrong with you, man? Look, stay right there where you at. Look, you don't want none of this, man. I don't know who you are or what you are, but you better stay the hell away from me. I don't know about you. You want some of this? You want some of this? I'm scared. Get back. Come on. Hunter! Stay right here. - Please. - Stay right here. Oh, stop, man. Look, I said stop! You know what "halt" means? Man, you better move. I'm not playing with you. Ray, take care of Jada. I got this. Look, buddy. I don't know what you've been through, but unless you back off, this is gonna go through you next. Jada! Oh, no. Baby, please. Shh. - Shh, it's okay. - I'm scared. Shh, stay right here. Shh. Stay with me, baby. Stay. - Is she all right? - Is it dead? Is it go... is it gone? Did you kill it? - I think so. - Good. Hunter! Oh, you've got to be kidding me. It's just a meth head, right? Some old punk washed up on the side of the pier. I don't know, Ray, why don't you show him your badge? Maybe that'll stop him. Formalities ended when he bit my niece! Got to be a rational explanation, right? Well, if you got one, I'm all ears. Buh-bye. You want some more of this? You better not come back over here. Ray? Oh, shit. Jada. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Shh, shh. Are we dreaming? No. I wish we were. Shh. I got this, man. - Go radio for help, please. - I'm on it. Stay with me. Shh. So this makes, what, five double shifts in a row now? Six, if you're counting. Mom, when's the last time you had a date? Look, she's hot, right, Taani? Smokin'. You're sweet. What I do is more important than how I look. But you just need to find some balance. Dad's been gone a long time. He'd want you to be happy. I am happy. Now that's more like it. Hello? I've got an accident on my hands here. Let me guess. Another charter client cast his line into his buddy's tackle box? No, but I owe you dinner for that. And a bottle of wine. The trauma still lingers. It's a different kind of accident. It's Ray's niece. She's hurt pretty bad. Uh, yeah. I'm on my way. Duty calls. More like booty calls. What'd he say? Enough. Look, all I'm saying is what's the point of living in paradise without someone to share it with? When I get home, you better be there, walls still standing. Promise. I love you. I'll take care of her, Mrs. Wright. Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of. Bye. Come on. Give me your arm. I got you. Wasn't nothing normal about that back there, Hunter. I mean, nothing we did was even able to stop him. How do we know there's no more out there looking for another midday snack, huh? Hey, Ray, reel it in. Reel it in. - You're gonna be okay. - Okay. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Doc. Hey, Jada? - What happened? - Curved laceration. Tissue loss. This is a bite wound. What happened? Look, we pulled this dead guy in off the water, right? We laid him down and then... His teeth... he started biting everybody, and then Hunter grabbed a machete, and he went... Hey, hey, hey. This guy regains consciousness, he starts biting and attacking everybody, and then we throw him overboard. It's okay, Jada. You're okay, honey. Okay. Coming through. So are you gonna be leaving? Yeah, tomorrow's my last day in Emrys Bay. No good-byes? You owe me dinner. You'll be okay. Are you coming or not? I'm gonna talk to Sheriff Akoni, see if we can figure out what's going on out there. Truck's in the lot. Meet us at the hospital later? Got it. Hey. Thanks for getting here so quick. No problem. She's really gonna be okay, right? She's gonna be fine. This is Akoni. I'm at the pier. The water looks calm. It's all fine here. Head out to Comet's Beach next. Copy that. Thought you'd be long gone, Shaw. Yeah, well, sometimes the heart and head aren't always in sync. Is there a reason why you're walking around with a machete? Uh, if you saw what I saw, you'd want one in both hands. Yeah, Ray called in. Some kind of sea monster? A lunatic attacked his niece. Beach squatter? Boating accident? What? I've been working on the water for 30 years. I have never, ever, seen anything like this. I don't have the time to go on a wild goose chase with you. What's going on out there is a bigger problem. You see that, right? Okay. Come on. Take a ride with me. ♪ You hear the sounds that come in waves ♪ The singer's name is Dag. Or maybe you're into the drummer. His name is Ivan. He's Russian! Interested? Ask me again when I can hear myself think. Yeah, party! ♪ Party, party, party ♪ ♪ To Raise the dead ♪ ♪ Party, party ♪ ♪ To Raise the dead ♪ - Chemical spill? - Maybe. That's the only thing I could think of that may explain that guy we saw on the boat today. - Where's the body? - I don't know. This is where we threw it overboard, though. We need to see where the source is coming from. I got eyes for you. Rand, you're so cool. Muah, muah, muah. That was incredible. I know. So you like our set? Yeah. You guys were... Not your kind of thing, huh? No, we had fun. Just doesn't really seem like you. Thank you. Rand's taste is more "mallet to the head." Me? All I want is fans who like our music because it comes from the heart, not because it's loud. I'm Dag. Sam. I think the earthquake may have something to do with this. We didn't go this deep last time. Is that a documented wreck? Not that I'm aware of. Ship's name and designation have been removed. No telling where it's from then. No, this is an Anton 350 made by Anders Marine in Denmark. Very few were ever made with this extended 80-foot hull. Whatever took it down took down a very rare ship. How do you know that? Grew up in San Pedro, right off the docks. Some people know cars. I know boats. There's the light source. Did you see that? Yeah, um, I put a machete into the chest of one of these guys today. It didn't stop him... didn't slow him down one bit. Come on, Shaw. Tell you what I think they are. What's that? It's alive, but dead. Let's stick to reality. These are zombies. You got me, Shaw. You got me. Don't even say it. Get us out of here. Pok, there's been some kind of outbreak offshore. Evac is mandatory. Get everyone off the beach now, and find my daughter. Attention: by order of the Emrys Bay Police, the beach is closed. This is a mandatory evacuation until further notice. This is not a drill. - Hey. - Hey, Doc. Akoni and I think there's been some kind of outbreak, so isolate Jada, keep your eyes open for anyone else who comes in with similar injuries. Okay. What are we talking about here? Danny, check this out. Clear the beach. Seek shelter. Could you... It should be over there. Uh, that's not a sound I like to hear. Look, Sam's at my house with Akoni's daughter. If anything happens, can you get to them? Got it, but the tsunami's only part of the problem. There's been some kind of outbreak. I've got to start prepping patients for evac. - You be safe. - Wait, wait. Wait! What are we gonna do about those things? What are you gonna do about that? Oh, my gosh... a tsunami. That's totally insane. Your mom's gonna have a busy shift. Your dad too. So I guess we're not getting tacos. Where do you think you're going? We need to get behind the wave. I've seen those things. I know what they're capable of. When the wave hits the beach, flooding's gonna be the least of our problems. - People are gonna need our help. - How are we gonna do that without getting ourselves killed? We're gonna ride the barrel of the wave. When we get to the beach, we'll storm it. We'll help everybody that we can. You know you're crazy, right? Hang on. It's a zombie tsunami. Come on. They're moving past us. Save your bullets. Blaine? Blaine, honey, are you okay? Shaun didn't make it. But we did, baby. That's all that matters. Hey! What'd I say? Baby! Hey, look, if there was ever a time to celebrate, this is it. Okay, so we'll only keep you two isolated until we know everything's okay. Great. It keeps getting better and better. It's just a precaution until we can determine what this outbreak is. What I saw out there... it's gonna take more than this to kill them. Dr. Wright, we need you outside. Okay. Hang in there. I'll check in soon, but I got to get back. This evacuation's reduced us to a skeleton staff. I'm trying. No! Come on, they're not breathing! What's wrong? - You took one of them on? - Yeah, Ray and I. It was a lot easier when we could throw them overboard. Hey! Hey, get away from them! Get off the beach! They're hurt. They need help. Come on! Come on! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You see what I'm talking about here? Zombies it is. I still can't get a hold of my mom or... or anybody. - What about your dad? - No, nothing yet. What's wrong with their faces? Tsunami must have messed them up. What if those things get up here? We've got to get away from this place. - Come on. - Yeah. Come on, this way. Let's go. I'll take care of that one. Watch out. Watch out. Get out of here. Out of my way. - Get out. Get out. - Run, run, come on! - Run! - Let's get out of here. Thank you! Uncle Ray. Hey, baby. I'm so cold. Oh, it's gonna be okay. Let me get you some cover. So hungry, I just... Shh. That's... shh, shh. Let me get the nurse to bring you something to eat, okay? Jada? Jada? Jada! Hey, hey, stay with me. Jada, stay with me. No, no. No. Jada. Jada, what you doing? Hey, hey, stop! Hey! Jada, stop! What you doing? What you doing? Jada, get off him! Stop doing that! No! Hey, help! Help! Beach is overrun. We've got to set up a triage for the victims. Maybe not. Let's get back to the station, regroup, and call for backup. Ray's truck. They're everywhere! Stop! Stop, stop. Don't shoot. Man, we're not one of them. You again. Yeah, of course. - I see you got a new sidekick. - I'm sorry. He's an idiot. Can you please help us? - Where'd you two come from? - We were at the beach. It was... it was awful, and we lost Shaun. Could you just, like, get us to our hotel or something? Five-star hotel's not gonna protect you from that. What's that even supposed to mean? That it's not a problem you can buy your way out of. So buckle up, sweetheart. They're coming. 4, 5, 0, 8. Hello? Hello? Someone, help! Somebody! No! Oh, my God. Have you seen what's out there? Yeah. If the contagion's aerosol, you could contract it from breathing. Unless you plan on tying their mouths shut, - this is not gonna get it. - They're infected. - Clearly, it's a contagion. - Look, it's more than that! They rode in here on that big-ass wave, bringing a double dose of disaster to this town like nobody's seen, so I suggest you lace up your running shoes, Doc, because if what's out there bites you, it's game over. How... how is this happening? How? Why? I stopped caring about that when I saw my niece bite the head off of that orderly. Do you know what that sounds like? Do you know what that looks like? Ugh. Move right to acceptance, Doc, 'cause denial is a death sentence. I can't reach any other units on comms. - Has anyone reported in? - No one. What are we dealing with here, sir? Welcome to Crazy Town, Officer Pok. Come on. Come on! Blaine, come on. Come on! Get up! Come on! - Sorry. - Blaine! Give me the chair! Get me the other one. Come on, Doc. We can't stop them all with just these. I know. Okay. We cut through the terrace. The admin offices are right next door. Terrace it is. How could you do that? Man, it's everybody for themselves! She saved your ass. What would you expect me to do, man, huh? Let them bite me? No way. I'm gonna do everything it takes to survive. Including this. Lower your weapon. Lower your weapon! Put it down. You got some balls, kid. I got bullets too. Take it easy. I want those big guns in there. That's not gonna happen. Give me the keys now! Open the door! Give me the keys! Open the door. Give me the keys now. Now! Stay with me, Pok. Stay with me. This kid's worse than the things outside. Rand! How's that for "pay to play?" Let's go! Come on. This way. Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait. Check out here. Go, go, go, go. Oh. Come on. Come on. I think I sprained my ankle. Okay. Okay, duck. Duck. - Oh, my God! - Taani! Help, help, help! Taani! Come on, Ta... Taani, look out! Get away from them! Go! Go! We'll find you! Okay. Okay. This is Emrys Bay station issuing an open-channel mayday. In addition to tsunami damage, we've had an outbreak of unknown origin. Over. To all naval assets in the vicinity, this is Emrys Bay station issuing an open-channel mayday. Tell me again why I didn't shoot that kid dead. That thing hanging around your neck. Fair enough. So I logged into the maritime registry using Ray's account. There's only one Anton 350 in the regional archives, and it's registered to Revok Industries from 1981 to 1985, but then it was decommissioned. Status now is salvaged, junked. Then what's it doing at the bottom of the ocean? Exactly. Something doesn't add up. I think we've got more pressing issues. The key to all this is this ship. If we can find one person that knows something about it, maybe we can get some answers. It's not safe here. We got to go. We're gonna need some more firepower. Okay, we cross over to the main building. - We cut through Radiology. - Okay. Oh, hell no! Bite me. Jada, don't you have something else to do? Oh, my God. Whatever that is, it's not Jada. Yeah, I know. Still not gonna be an easy call to my sister Gina, though. Mm-mm. We pulled enough hardware off drug boats and narco planes over the years to outfit a small army. Wow. Did you get this off a drug dealer? Some kid bought it online with his mom's credit card. Went all shogun on his brother's bedroom. What happened to his brother? Still looking for his pinky toe. When we're done with them, we're gonna find my daughter. Hey! Hey... Dude, are you serious right now? Seriously, you guys can't just leave me like this. Let's go kill some dead guys. Hey! Hey, this is murder! Hey! I can't hold them off any longer. Do it now! Nice job. They're still squirming. I'll take squirming over biting any day. Reinforcements. 'Cause one would have been too easy. Come on. You shoot a zombie in the head, they're supposed to die, right? Maybe there's something more. That's what I'm afraid of. Look. Dead ahead. They're getting on my nerves. Hold on. Roadkill. Come on. Come on. Don't look back. Come on. Come on. Come on, be quick. Come on. Wake up! Wake up! Come on, open the door! Wake up! Wake up! Come on! They're trying to kill us! What's going on, man? - What's wrong with them? - What are you doing? Get back in here, Ivan. Rock and roll, baby! Come on! We gotta go! We got to go now! Car's dead. What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? We'll figure this out. They're everywhere. Come on! Hello? Hello? This is private property. The gate's there for a reason, so just go away. No, no. No. I need your help, please. They're after me. Turn around. I need to check you out. Look, perv, just open the door! Have you been bitten? What? Look. Look at me. Do I look like I have been bitten? Show me the back of your head. Oh, my God! Fine. If you don't open the door now, I am gonna be bit. Are we all good? Hello? Yeah, yeah, okay. You live here by yourself? Yeah. That explains the Unabomber chic. Can you please put that away? You first. Okay. I've been watching from up here. Looks really bad. I have monitors all around town. When these things arrived, just about everyone was infected in less than an hour. There are so many of them. I need to call my dad. Can I... can I use that? Please? Thank you. Dad, do you copy? Taani, where are you? You're okay? You don't know how glad I am to hear your voice. Yeah. I'm safe. I'm, uh... I'm at the compound on top of the hillside. At Driscoll's? I told you never to go near that place. He's crazy. Yeah. Great. Dad, I didn't really have a choice, 'kay? His place is pretty fortified. Do you really want me to leave? No. I don't want you to leave. I need you to go get Sam. We got separated at the market. Just stay put. We'll come to you. Be careful. Stay safe. At least we know she's okay. Yeah. We should, uh, probably go in now. Yeah. So long, sucker. Hey, baby. Hey. - Baby... - I'm so sorry. I didn't mean anything by that, baby. - You have to find a way out. - No, you're coming with me. - I can't. I'll slow you down. - No. I'm not leaving you. You're gonna have to. You'll move faster without me. Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna get their attention. Wait, here. Take this. Right here! Over here! ♪ You hear the sounds that come in waves ♪ ♪ By people dancing on a grave ♪ Here! Help! Over here! Help, help! ♪ And things are just about to get depraved ♪ ♪ We'll party ♪ ♪ Party, party ♪ ♪ Party to raise the dead ♪ - ♪ Party, party ♪ - Come on. ♪ Party ♪ ♪ To raise the dead ♪ ♪ 'Cause once you're underground ♪ ♪ You won't hear a sound ♪ We got to go get him. He... he hurt his foot. We'll get him. Come on. Hey, Sam. It's gonna be all right. He's dead because of me. I-I don't know where my mom is, and... and we got separated from Taani. Taani's gonna be fine. She's the one who told us where to find you. - They didn't get her? - No. We're gonna get your mom at the hospital, and then we're gonna get Taani. Don't you worry. Thank you, Hunter. - Let's be quick, Shaw. - I'm on it. See if you can text your mom. - Still no signal. - She could be anywhere. I need to let her know that I'm here. Anything we do is gonna draw their attention. Exactly. I need to get to the nurse's station. Well, you're not going alone. I know every inch of this place. You two will just slow me down. Take this. You're gonna need to protect yourself. - I know how to use a gun. - You're not getting a gun. Fine. Awesome. Coast is clear. Wait! The patients are getting restless. Time for their medicine. Attention, please. - What's she doing? - I don't know. This is an important message for Dr. Kenzie Wright. Please come to the second floor of the nurse's station to claim your daughter. She's extremely worried, and would like to leave this freak show behind. Can't hold them off for much longer. I don't know what's worse... their teeth... Or their breath. Got any ideas? Let's see if we can shock some sense into them. Let go! Let go! Please! Let go! Hey. Sam's safe. Is she on this floor? Down the hall. Ray, take this. You two guys been having a cookout? Just go. Sam? Sam, come on. - Sam? - Mom! Come on. Grab her hands. I'll get her feet. Get your knife. You're okay. Come on. Let's go. All right. Wait. Hang on. These... these ones are different. Yeah, this is one of the ones that started all this. He came in on the waves. It looks like these guys were experimented on. We got to get out. Sam, Kenzie, stay by me. Come on. All right, get in the car. Go easy on Driscoll. He doesn't like guests. Dad! You said you weren't going out. Now this time, you put your friend in danger. I know. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - It's okay. - Oh, my gosh. Are you all right? - Have you been bitten? - No, I haven't been. No! No! No! No biters in the house. I said I wasn't bitten. Shaw. Hey, before we bail, do you mind if we use that radio to call for help? Just don't mess up anything on my desk. This is Officer Kameo Akoni of Emrys Bay. We need assistance. Anyone out there? It's quiet out there. Cell towers are down. There hasn't been any chatter on the radio for hours. Not that I'd want to talk to anybody. We've had two tsunamis, and no one has come to check on us in town. Well, that should tell you something right there. Help has to be on the way. Coast Guard's coming. There's no one out there. Akoni? What's going on down there? - Akoni! - Dad? Akoni! Run! It's coming! - Akoni! - Dad! What the hell is going on down there? Say something! Akoni! - Stay back, Sam. - Akoni! Mom! Thanks, Driscoll. No problem. Way to go, Mom. Everybody okay? Dad? - Dad? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby. - No. - I'm so sorry. - No! - I'm sorry. No. - We can't stay here. - Place held up just fine till you whackadoodles showed up. Oh, your little science project that almost killed my daughter and I? We can agree that one's on you, right? And exactly what were you doing with your bunkmate down there? Trying to figure out what makes them tick. What'd you learn? The liquid inside it tested consistent with phosphorus. That explains the blue glow in the water. The Taser is the only thing I've seen that could stop it. We stopped a whole bunch in the hospital with electricity as well. That's why I connected the Taser to the sword. Zombie nuts roasting on a open fire. How are gonna kill them all with one Taser? Downed power lines. I saw several of them at the beach, but the grid is still running. We use the tidal pools to conduct the electricity. All we need to do is lure the zombies into the water, and then we run the power to it. Fish in a barrel. But the ship is not in your barrel. We're gonna have to blow up that ship too. If we can take care of most of them, then the Coast Guard can take care of the stragglers when they get here. If they get here. Okay. How do we blow up the ship? Here. Ta-da. You can take this C4 with you. You can take grenades. You can even take this cereal with you when you leave. You're gonna leave, right? I'll take the ones on land. I guess I'm the captain of the boat, huh? What the hell do I know about C4? Driscoll, we're gonna need your help with that. A lot of people are gonna die unless we stop them. All right. I'm in. I'll clear a path, and we'll all make a run for it. Oh... Come on. - What's wrong? - His Taser isn't working. He needs my help. Come on. Fire up the wood chipper. It's feeding time. Nice moves. - Thanks. - Come on, Driscoll! Come on, let's go! You're gonna have some good roses this year. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Come on. Let's go. No, you come on. Let's go. Hurry up. It's over here. Hey, hey, wait a minute, man! Wait! All right. Watch your step. Hey, hey, hey. Look, if anything happens to me, just take care of Sam, okay? Nothing's gonna happen to either of you. I promise. Should have just followed my instincts... motored to another port where it's safe. So that's why you live in a boat? So you can take off when things get rough? I always knew you weren't the settling-down type of guy, Hunter. Knowing that made it easier to be friends without getting hurt. Seeing you and Sam at the hospital, risking everything to get back to each other... Taani and her dad doing the same thing. I thought I had it all. Made me realize I don't have anything. Aw, hell no. Look, y'all been beating around the bush for months. This ain't no time for canoodling. Sam! Sam! Come on. - Shh, shh, shh, shh. - Come on. - Thank you. - Yeah. We both know how this is going to end. It's not over till it's over. Doesn't anyone else think it's weird that he ain't turned yet? They didn't bite through his head and penetrate his skull... didn't get to the brain. I've been watching on my monitors. It takes longer through the skin. Town's in your hands now, Hunter. Take care of it. And take care of them. Do it better than I did. What's that supposed to mean? I'll tell you what I know. Revok Pharmaceuticals came here 30 years ago. They claimed to be making major strides with a new antiaging drug. They needed to test it on humans, away from FDA scrutiny in the United States. They brought in staff, patients, security, and the local council leaders and I just needed to make sure that everything stayed off the radar. They paid us. They financed trips, and they made sure that my wife got the best medical treatment before she passed on. If you wouldn't mind fast-forwarding to the part where the zombies come to town, I think we'd all appreciate it. They lied. The drug wasn't ready. They shouldn't have been trying it on humans. There are hideous side effects, and they knew we couldn't say anything, because we were all complicit. How could you allow this, Kameo? By the time we realized what they were doing, they'd shipped out all the patients and staff. But in the back of my mind, I knew they sunk the ship. When Hunter tied the boat at the bottom of the ocean to Revok, there was no denying what I had been a party to... what I had done. You're not seeing the bigger play here. The trials actually worked. Those patients' hideous reactions were not side effects. They were the desired effects. So they developed a drug that would weaponize an entire population? One that would destroy itself from within? A biological weapon is worth more on the black market than any antiaging drug. Come on. Let's move. Go. Go! I got this, guys. Run! Run! Go! Keep going! Come on. Daddy, come... - Wasp knife? - Yeah. - Got another? - Have this one. Don't you have enough toys already? No. I love you. Grab the bag. Let's go. Okay. All right. Let's get to it. - Come on, Taani. - I'll catch up. All right, call me if you get into any trouble. Driscoll, what about the ones still up at your house? You didn't think I took all the C4 with me, did you? Ray, see you on the other side. You too, brother. Hey, man, is that stuff stable? Stable as I am. Move out my way. - Oh! - There it is. All right, the fuses blew when the lines went down. I can make the downed power lines active again. I'm gonna use those tidal pools to complete the circuit. Then we'll reset the breaker. Once we do that, the power's gonna flow. We're gonna have to hurry. I'll get the lines in the water. Stay here. Don't hit that switch until I tell you. - Got it? - Yeah. Time to kick some ass. All right, hit it! Guys, we got to hurry. They're getting close. I still don't understand why I have to be the one to secure the bombs to the sunken ship. Because I have to drive this thing away before the detonator goes off. That's your stuff, and I'm not putting her in the water. Okay, fine. I'll make sure the C4 locks on to the boat. Up to you to do the rest. Ah... I got it. I don't know why I keep saying "yes" to everybody. I don't even like people. Maybe 'cause you're kind of a good guy. Nope. Okay. It worked. And now we got to get the zombies. We need bait. Okay. I'm gonna Pied Piper them to follow me into the tidal pools. Once I do... - We'll pull the switch. - Exactly. Hey! Come and get it! Come over here! Come on! Come and get me! Over here! Hey! Hey, over here! Oh, yeah. Come and get it. Come on! Throw me the C4 once I go in. Time to fight crazy with crazy. Driscoll, get out the water! Move! Move! Move, Driscoll! Move! No! No! Go up front. - Hunter needs help. - You stay here! Be careful! Come on. Come on. Now! Throw the switch! Okay. Hurry. They're close. Put this vest on. Get in the water. It's not happening. - Taani! - No. - Taani! - No! Taani! Look, when that anchor hits the bottom, this boat is not going anywhere. Your point? If your dad was here, he'd kick my butt if I didn't kick you off my boat, so I'm kicking you off my boat! Okay. When you get in the water, hold the vest, lay back, and ride the wave. What about the zombies? Oh, don't worry about them. They don't have a prayer. It's not working! Come on. Mom! Mom! It worked. Hey, Hunter. It's Ray. Come in. Hunter? Hunter, do you copy? Ray, we got them. What's going on out there? It's a little rough out here, but I'm about to catch the big one. Oh, God. Come on, Hunter! Oh, come on. Oh, my... Hey. I didn't think you made it. Looks like we got most of them. Mom. Come on. Taani? - I've got you. - Help. Are you okay? It's okay. Sit down. What about Ray? You're gonna be okay. A little bruised up, but you just need rest. Are you still leaving? Not on your life, Kenzie. Good, 'cause you still owe me dinner. And wine. And a movie. Anything else? It's about time. Finally. Come on. What are we gonna do now? Whatever we do, we're doing it together.
