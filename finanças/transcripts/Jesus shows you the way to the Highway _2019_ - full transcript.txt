[Static] [Static continues] [Static] [Whirring] [Professor] Sir, come see this! [Commandant] God! That's impossible. [Professor] Something inside must have killed Agent Tracy. Playback Psychobook's analysis of the mission. Strange, a virus playing against himself. What the hell is his master plan? Keep this top secret, don't tell the others about agent Tracy. Yes, Commandant. [Gasping] - Call an ambulance. - [Continues gasping] [Telephone ringing] [Palmer] Yes? OK. Understood. Agent D. T. Gagano. Where the hell is your mind? - Sorry, Lieutenant. - Move your ass. [Professor] Alarms went off at 19:16. A virus has taken over the system. It's source code is hidden inside a region of Psychobook. [Palmer] What type is it? - Soviet Union computer virus. - Damn Russians! They are infecting the whole system. - Hey, Magnus! - Hey! Have a good mission, man! Lately, the Soviet Union has been becoming more and more aggressive towards the management system. [Grunts] - Is something wrong? - [Gagano] Back... back pain! Status? Uploading to Psychobook in five, four, three. I will be monitoring you. 'Boys, the suspect is approaching the entrance. 'You have 45 seconds.' Block him with a force ring. 'Impossible, he doesn't have an implanted chip.' Shit, he's a Soviet! Put me in touch with the Professor. - Continue fumigating. - Yes, sir. [Telephone ringing] I've got the virus source code. We need your assistance right now. Send over the satellite. What the hell are you doing in my house? Pest Control state company. What the fuck? I'm putting an end to the plague in this building. No, these are a bunch of fake... Jiminy, we need support. Use Zeus Satellite to neutralize him! 'I need the target's coordinates.' Run, now! - Palmer. - Relax, man. It's time to die, Agents! Jiminy, he's on the water tower! [Screaming] [Indistinct advert on loudspeaker] What the hell happened here? The virus is striking again. It has attacked Psychobook's advertising system. Now... OK, Malin, it's enough for today. Your poor husband has been waiting there for more than ten minutes. Come and have a shower with me, boy. OK. [Screaming] - What's wrong? - My back! Birdie, are you sleeping? I'm gonna hand in my resignation tomorrow. - I'm done with the CIA. - Are you sure? I love you, birdie. I love you, my little fly. [Man moaning on TV] 'Yeah... oh!' [Moaning continues] 'Ooh, yeah!' 'Mr. Batfro!' [Sirens wailing] [Palmer] 'Stop watching this Russian propaganda 'and get your skinny ass into the office right away. 'We have a Code Red.' - Right now? - 'Yes, right now!' [Malin] What's going on? Where the hell are you going? I'll be right back. It's just a moment. Thank God you're quitting. Duty calls, for the last time. Lieutenant Palmer, Agent Gagano. Tonight you will be facing Operation Jungle. Please, Professor. The CIA believes that the Soviet Union virus is planning a big operation to take over Psychobook. After analyzing the piece of code you brought, we've found an anomaly in Psychobook's old abandoned CPU. Your mission is to retrieve samples of any anomalous substance found inside that factory. Any questions? How do we enter the domain of the virus? Our hackers were able to track the Soviet Union protection system, so we will drop your avatars in there. [Telephone ringing] You're talking with the President of the United States of America. Commandant Alfons Rebane. Estonia. 'Commandant, give me the update.' Operation Jungle will be launching tomorrow night. Excellent! Keep me posted, Commandant. [Malin] The owners told me we can visit the place tomorrow, it's just an hour's drive from here. We could put the counter here on this side. You see? - What do you think, darling? - Pepperoni, fresh tomato. You are not listening to me. I think it's a good idea. Let's go there, little fly, let's give it a try. Let's leave this horrid city and try. But... I'm a CIA agent. Things are not so simple. So you didn't drop in your resignation letter... Well... let's just plan for it. Plan it? We've been talking and talking. It's been seven years, my little fly. You don't give a shit about my kickboxing academy. I do, but... But what? I'm tired of planning! But, birdie... I told my boss I'll be leaving by the end of the week. You can stay with your special force, Agent Gagano. The system will be cracked soon. The old CPU must be right there. This will be my last mission, Palmer. We have been saving up to open this kickboxing academy. Big, famous kickboxing academy. Why don't you open a pizzeria instead? A pizzeria? Me? Nah, it's just a hobby. What about you, Palmer? - What about me? - About the future. The future? [Scoffs] Who cares about the future? Commandant, is the CIA aware that you're sending two men to their probable death? Professor, no agent dies inside Psychobook. It's just a virtual reality. Tell that to Agent Tracy. Are you challenging my command, Professor? With all due respect, this new threat is unknown, Commandant. Please, shut up, they are right here. Don't be so worried. They can't hear you. They're in there. Jiminy, we are in position. [Jiminy] 'Message from Commandant Alfons Rebane.' [Commandant] 'Lieutenant Palmer, are you alone?' Yes, sir. Make sure it's the dwarf who manipulates any kind of substance. We wouldn't want to put you in any risk. 'You're too valuable for the CIA.' 'End of the message.' Lieutenant! Come see this. [Palmer] It looks like the substance from the CIA lab. [Gagano] But that's impossible. The government has the monopoly over the synthesis. Come on, take a couple of samples. I'm starting to feel dizzy. Dammit, the substance might be emitting gas. Jiminy! Gas mask. I need a mask! Palmer, the mask! Jiminy, create a gas mask! Oh, this is painful, Palmer. Please wake me up! Don't be a chicken, I will see you outside in a few seconds. Lieutenant! Let's deactivate Psychobook's monitoring system. - I can't do that. - Do you want to die? I can't die in here, Stalin. OK, enough, I'm leaving. It was nice to see you. Jiminy, take me home! 'Loading the way out.' [Scoffs] This will only keep us out of the network for a moment, General Stalin. Operation Jungle is now in our hands, Lieutenant Palmer Eldritch. You know me? Are you kidding me? I'm a virus. I know you better than yourself. What do you want? Help me sell the substance. You'll be very rich. I don't make deals with computer viruses. Ahahah, you will! Look! Who were you serving when you fucked Commandant Alfons Rebane's wife, you dirty bastard? Make the right deals and I will make you rich. Betray me and I will dismember you in the real world. Fuck. Try to wake him up, Professor. Sorry, but that's not possible. Shit. What the hell happened inside? Ladies and gentleman, Captain Lagucci performing for you tonight. Yeah. Yeah... [In German] Lick this! [In German] Lick this! Asshole. Fuck it! Excuse me. You must leave right now. Do you see anybody else here? Do you see? I don't see anybody else here. This show is for me! Ooh... [Indistinct insult] Captain Lagucci is not dancing for you, baby, she's dancing for the universe. [Telephone ringing] Hello? Malin, it's for you, darling. Hello? Please promise, if he passes, he must pass at home, with me. - Hey, I will try. - Please, promise. Hey, I promise. You see? I promise. I promise you. Don't worry, I... I promise. Promise... What the fuck are you doing? That was not my intention, I just... You're such a brute. What happened between us was a big mistake. OK, that's fine. Create a mirror doppelganger of Agent Gagano. Mirror copy created. Upload our copy into Betta Ethiopia. [Woman] Copy uploaded, Comrade Stalin. [Gagano] Excuse me, waiter. What would you like to eat, sir? Just a pizza margarita. [Waiter] Pizza... mar-ga-ri-ta. OK, sir. Anything to drink? No, thanks. [Man] Huh? Shit man, how unfortunate! It's the government's fucking president. [PA] 'Round one!' [PA] 'You win!' This is the substance! Vote for Batfro! Damn drug addicts! [PA] 'Continue voting for Batfro as your favorite president, 'the chosen one to eradicate the damn drug addicts.' [Man] Shut up! Not even your own mother would vote for you. Don't you like the pizza, sir? It's fine... but the oven is not heating the bottom enough so the base of the pizza is too soft. May I have the bill, please? I hope you accept credit cards. Phew! Jiminy, priority message. 'Trying to find a secure connection, please hold.' Here is Agent Gagano, last known location was the abandoned Psychobook's CPU. I paid with my credit card, you should be able to track my position. 'New message from headquarters.' 'Agent, new position identified as Betta Ethiopia. 'Wait for instructions.' Come on, guys, take me home! [Italian accent] Hello, sir. This is Mr. Sophistication. Sorry for calling you so late, but, er... we have a problem with the credit card in the restaurant. [Jiminy] 'Agent D. T. Gagano.' Thank God. [Commandant] 'I have bad news, Agent. 'I'm afraid you're in an irreversible coma. 'We can't wake you up.' What? What the hell, Commandant! 'What you're experiencing 'is the last traces of your mental activity.' [Gagano] 'Something must be wrong. 'This partition of the system looks very real.' You don't have much time left, kid, although Psychobook is still able to track your inner-voice. 'You're wrong, Commandant. I'm here! 'Don't you see me?' [Waiter] Sir! Could you please open the door? 'I hope you are still able to receive this message. 'They told me it will be the last one.' No! This must be a stupid mistake. 'Your brain is fading, my love. 'Rest in peace.' 'End of the message.' Listen, birdie. I will come back before Sunday. This is my last mission. 'Listen, Agent, the Soviet Union is planning something big. 'Try to find out before you wither and die. 'Good luck and sorry.' Shit! [Jiminy] 'End of the message.' Here you are, you drug addict! You motherfucker. What did you do to him? How can he die? All this shit is just a computer game. We are trying to find out, lady. Bring him back to me! You go inside that computer game! - Easy. Easy! - Go and bring him back! Malin, please stop! Please, please. Malin! [Beeping] Fuck you, Stalin. What is this? - My savings. - My ass. Where did you get a pink Mastercard? What's going on? Where's the money coming from, Palmer? I was thinking I could help you open the most... [Malicious laughter in the distance] ...the most beautiful kickboxing academy anybody has ever, ever seen. Did you bring the goods, mister man? Transfer the money to my credit card. First the goods! Your money's transferred. [Door opening] - Stop! Police! - The cops! Fuck! Look, dwarf, we have a problem. This piece of crap is fake. In this country only one type of person uses false credit cards. Can you stop fucking interrupting me? Oh, I'm very sorry, sir. [Batfro] Do you want to scare the kid? [Gagano] Hey! I'm grown-ass man! [Batfro] Put the gun away! Now! [Sophistication] I'm sorry, sir. For god's sake! What was I saying? - In this country... - Ah, yes! In this country only the drug dealers that work for Reverend Roy use false credit cards. I don't know what you're talking about. Please, Mr. Sophistication, do your thing. - Who are you working for? - For no one! Get down on your knees. Now! Stop! He's just a child! So... we have a brave man here. You're talking to a patriot, show a little bit of respect. I will teach you some respect. Lick my boots. Go ahead and lick them! [Man] You're a disgrace to the country. Hey! You! Leave him alone! [Gunshots] [Sighs] He was obviously a hippie. Fuck! What the hell? Shit. Fuck this. Prince, we are at your service. I'm not your prince. Come on, you're immortal! You've been sent to fight Batfro and his false democracy. That arrogant president is a disgrace to our country. [Jiminy] 'Error.' Jiminy, are you still able to track? 'Error.' What is that? The virus must be generating doppelgangers. 'Agent, Betta Ethiopia is outside 'of the domain of the virus Soviet Union.' Record my voice. 'Impossible to record the message. 'Inner-voice signal too weak to be tracked.' Have you seen that sorcery? 'Signal too low. Signal too low. [Static, fading] 'Signal too low.' Jiminy? Jiminy! Wake up. I must wake up! Wake up. I must wake up. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Gagano! Wake up! Wake up! Please, my Prince! You're going to hurt yourself. Stop, Prince. - Wake up, Gagano. Wake up! - Please, my Prince! Wake up. Wake up, Gagano! Wake up, wake up! [Telephone ringing] What? Sir, Mr. Sophistication is here. Why did you let him? Hello, sir. My kung fu masters. Spaghetti. Ravioli. Baltazar. [Laughs] Tell them to bring me a whisky. What's your plan for the dwarf, sir? What are you gonna do with him? I will lock him up forever! - Please, sir. - 'Mr. President. 'The midget is more important than you can imagine. 'He's the key element to strengthen our relations.' My dear Stalin, are you talking about the military agreement with the Soviet Union? 'I'm talking about a new agreement 'to take over the whole Psychobook. 'The midget is a CIA agent 'and can give us full access to the source code.' What do you need to organize this? 'First, to crack the system, 'we need to get our hands on the most powerful terminal. 'The Ark of the Covenant.' [Batfro] The Ark is protected by a Shaolin monk. He's invincible. Psychobook programmed him with Force 7. [Sophistication] Let my kung fu masters handle this. They will get the Ark of the Covenant for us. [PA] 'Round one!' [PA] 'You lose!' 'Upgrade the kung fu masters to Force 8.' [PA] 'Upgrade complete.' [PA] 'Round two.' [PA] 'You win! 'The Arc is yours!' "Davvero. Grazie, grazie." '"Davvero. Grazie, grazie."' Now that we have the old relic, let's get the key. Mr. President. Congratulations, Mr. President. This new agreement with the Soviet Union will give us full access to all the profiles and regions of Psychobook. We will be able to protect our dear citizens against bad guys. [Indistinct chatter] - Sir. - Get out! Sir, can I borrow your dwarf tomorrow? Of course not. Sir, I can make him give us the code. Are you deaf or something? You don't trust me, Mr. President? Do you take me for a fool? I'm sorry, baby. I'm just talking to this... he's a jackass. So why don't we collaborate together? [Batfro] I don't trust this clown in the hat. Batfro, you will soon rule over Psychobook, let Mr. Sophistication do his job. OK. Comrade Stalin, I will do it as a personal favor to you. [Laughing] [Footsteps] Agent, tomorrow you will obey Mr. Sophistication's orders. And I will send you home so you can get your revenge. [Gagano] What revenge? Do you want to see the truth? This is the truth! Harder! Come inside me. I'm trying to come. Yes, yes, yes! I'm so wet. You're so big! It's so big! It's tearing me apart. [Palmer] What the fuck is that? [Stalin] Obey our instructions and get your revenge. You can't trick me with your lies! Your game is over, Stalin. You hear me? Your game is over. The game is over. Don't cry, my little Prince. You must be strong. Be strong. You must be strong, my Prince. Don't cry. Come on, my little Prince, don't cry. Be strong, my little Prince. [Gagano] Wait a second. Wait a second! Wait a second! Now I can see my dream. I'm already feeling much better. I'm the Emperor of Betta Ethiopia so I can do whatever I want. Anything in the world! Everything in the world! And I can open a pizzeria, it's my pizzeria! And I will do it with Malin, my beloved Malin. She's so beautiful. She's like poetry, like the cool breeze on a summer's day. My love... my everything. Stop sodomizing me, Agent, and try to find a way to wake up! There is something wrong with the mission, - I need to find the substance. - What for? It's the only way back to Malin. Do you understand? Forget that woman. You are the savior. She is just a temptation of the devil. How do I know you're not a figment of my imagination, huh? You belong here, you're the savior. You're not real, you're part of my imagination. - This is a shame, Messiah! - [Gagano] You understand? Messiah, this is a shame. Yeah... shit. You're our only hope. You were sent to us to liberate our land, to rid us of the fascists. [Batfro] Take the dwarf to Mr. Sophistication. And no tricks! Please, Agent, accept my apologies. I don't wanna create any problems with the CIA. What do you want? I want... your coding signature in order to access Psychobook. The Ark of the Covenant. The original and most powerful Psychobook terminal. Holy ghost! You just want to go back home and I want to rewrite my role in Betta Ethiopia. You just need to insert your coding signature and Spaghetti will do the rest. [Beeping] 'Welcome to Psychobook, Agent D. T. Gagano.' [Beeping] Commandant, come see this. The virus is hacking the whole system. Agent Gagano has activated the tracking system with his coding signature. Put the satellite in position and let's get rid of the virus. [Professor] Satellite over Betta Ethiopia. Sir, Psychobook detected the coding signature of Agent Gagano. I'm asking for permission to destroy Betta Ethiopia. Agent Gagano, sir. Our field agent. He's still alive inside. 'Mr. President, are you there? 'The whole system is under attack!' Commandant Rebane, we can't annihilate a whole region just to kill a virus. Sir, we can easily rebuild the region, 'it won't take us more than two days.' I understand your point, Commandant, but my order is to abort the mission. Understood, sir. 'What about our annual meeting?' [Distorted] Of course I will attend the golf championship. We have full access to all profiles and regions. Excellent. Kill Mr. Sophistication. Now, I will put an end to the reign of this arrogant motherfucker, Mr. Batfro. Don't you see, my friends? Betta Ethiopia belongs to me, Mr. Sophistication. "Italiano." What the hell is that? [Both] The lord is my shepherd. I shall have faith in him. Hey you! Agent D. T. Gagano, CIA! You better surrender, understand? Shit! Agent! Whoa! Thank God, Palmer. Get me out of here. [Palmer] That's not possible, kid. You're in an irreversible coma out there. - You're not here to rescue me? - Run! To the cabins. They shut down the mission. It's all over. We had the opportunity to kill Stalin, what's wrong out there? Run, kid! Now that you're safe, I need to go. Why did you come then? [Palmer] I'm on a covert mission, it's above your clearance. I wish I could get you out of here, but I can't. Wake me up outside. You're braindead, friend. Try to understand. I should go. I... I'm suffocating! Help! I'm suffocating! Please! Please, I'm suffocating. Please! Oh, baby! Oh, man, what a headache! Oh, baby! Wait... where the hell am I? CIA Agent Gagano. I'm Roy Mascarone. Er... nice to meet you. Roy Mascarone. You know, until a few minutes ago I thought I was Jesus Christ. You know Jesus, Jesus Christ? But then I saw your face. My face? I'm sure I know you from another place and I'm sure I can help you. To go home? Yes, and to know the truth about this mission, Agent. I hope my story can help you understand yours, Agent Gagano. It all starts when I wake up, I'm on top of a mountain and I'm kind of sleepy. I don't remember anything about my past or who the hell I am, OK? But then... listen, here comes the most interesting part of the story. I start opening my eyes and I think, "What is this place? "I should get out of here as soon possible." This is what comes to my mind, OK? Just move, get out of here. Then, I realize that something like a voice inside of me is telling me that I am Jesus Christ. I start walking, around me there's only desert as far as the eye can see. And then, suddenly... I realize I can perform miracles! So I'm a hero and I can do tricks. All these powers made me very unbelievable as a human being. And then hey, who is this guy again? He's always at the beach. His name is Palmer Eldritch. I feel terrible, I'm dating the wife of my colleague. He says he's dating his colleague's wife. He also tells me he's trafficking this thing called the substance. Palmer talks wonderful things about the substance. I follow him into his secret den. Man, I really wanna explore the effects of this mysterious substance. And explore parallel dimensions, multiethnic people. Man, I start viewing the substance in my memorable hallucinations. The people are waiting for me, for the substance of Reverend Roy. The one that makes them explore a new fascinating universe. But fuck! I got caught by this strange masked guy. Run, run! Escape from him! Get to a place where he will never catch you. He recodified me into one of these disgusting flies and sent me to a place where I would never be a threat again. [Gagano] Siberia? [Roy] No, the Pagagayo resort, man. The luxurious conditions of the Papagayo resort made me forget about everything! Then, I woke up in this yard and I saw your face and I remembered the truth. I am Roy Mascarone, not Jesus. How did my face make you remember? Because, you gave me the keys to my Mercedes-Benz, Agent. [Gagano] But I've never seen you before. [Roy] Let me explain it to you, man. In 1997, Alan Foreman performed a series of experiments at MIT. They were successful in creating a network of makeshift data collections. The most comprehensive analysis of human behavior ever conducted. A brain mapping network called Psychobook. Excuse me! Are these your keys? Oh! Thanks, man. I don't have pockets. You're the owner of the pizza place by the beach, right? Yeah. I own it with my girlfriend. Roy Mascarone. Are you here for the experiment? - Yeah. - Mmm. The reality, man, is that you and I are right now in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the year is 1997. Massachusetts? What the hell is that? The truth. The place where you will wake up after three centuries or within the next hour or in two days. You don't work for the CIA, Agent. It's just a hallucination. What? God. Don't you see, Agent? Operation Jungle, the CIA, all of this is just a virtual projection. - We are in 1997. - What? They're playing with us. To collect our reactions to different situations. You! You cheap copy of Jesus! Let me go! Let me go! You are charged with genocide and crimes against humanity. You will never catch me alive. Shit! The substance is in the candy. Fuck! I'm going to lock you up for the next three thousand years! There is no escape! [Both] The lord is my shepherd. I shall have faith in him. What are you doing? Come on, stand up! Let's fight. Come on, guys. Let's fight. Stand up! Come on, stand up. Let's fight together. Come on! Come on. Come on! Come on! Wait a second, your praying is cracking the system. - [Man] It's working! - [Gagano] Do you see? You have cracked the speed of Psychobook! Here you go. Go back to your reality. You belong to that world. You must go now. I'm sorry for failing you. Bye, my Emperor. Agent Gagano's mirror copy has vanished. Eliminate this avatar as well. Sir, Commandant Rebane is online. Commandant, prepare the corpse of Agent Gagano for disposal. 'He's still alive, sir.' You must put an end to his suffering. I can't do that. Proceed. Salute! You must increase your sales, Lieutenant. Stalin is not happy with you. Increase my sales? Fuck you! Huh? It's him. It's all I could save. 'Birdie! Birdie, I'm back! I'm back! - 'What day is it?' - Saturday. 'We're not late. We're still on time.' Do you still want to come with me, little fly? 'Of course. I have a vision, my love. 'A new place by the sea.' So, let me go to the gym and pack my stuff. 'Malin, I know you'll get angry at me 'but I have to complete this mission. 'It's my duty and... Palmer is dealing the substance.' Who cares? We're finally together, right? 'Aren't you happy to see me?' [Phone ringing] - Who's this? - 'It's me, Agent Gagano.' Impossible, you're dead. 'I'm not dead, sir, I'm trapped inside a portable TV.' Stay there. I will pick you up. 'I'm here, Commandant.' Operation Jungle is something very big, Agent. Bigger than you ever imagined. Shit, Palmer! He was just there! [Palmer] Oh, no! The CIA has taken him. Sorry for this, Agent, we can't trust you anymore. 'No!' Captain Lagucci. Lagucci! You motherfucker! The Soviet virus is not our enemy anymore. - Stalin went missing. - 'What happened to him?' Well, we believe that the Russians destroyed the virus themselves after losing control of it. Let's go home. The substance is our real enemy, it's using us and the Russians to colonize planet Earth. It's using all of us to spread and reproduce. Oh, come on, guy, I will take you home. [Narrator] 'A ticking bomb 'means trouble for Batman and Robin.' [Robin] 'Holy breaking and entering, it's Batgirl!' 'Quick, Batgirl, untie us before it's too late.' [Batgirl] 'It's already too late.' Are you sure you're gonna be OK here? - 'I am, Captain.' - OK. "Ciao, ciao." [Batgirl] 'Same job, same employer 'means equal pay for men and women.' 'No time for jokes, Batgirl.' 'It's no joke. It's the Federal Equal Pay law.' [Robin] 'Holy act of Congress.' 'If you're not getting equal pay, 'contact the Wage and Hour Division, 'U. S. Department of Labor.' We must go, baby. I made a good sale at the carnival. I'm not going anywhere without him. By now, he's probably been turned into junk. At least we made some fresh money, we must leave now or the CIA will catch us. I love you. I love you. Fuck you, asshole. 'Traitor!' Fuck! What the hell is that? Get out! Get out! Fuck. Look, I bought you some new batteries. Listen, I wanted to tell you. We're going to Mallorca with Palmer. - 'We?' - The three of us. We will open the kickboxing academy. 'He stole our dream. It was the two of us. Not him.' You were dead. 'I was doing my job. 'In the nights, I dreamt of our pizzeria, 'a beautiful restaurant by the sea.' You never told me about your pizzeria. 'It really doesn't matter now.' Palmer saved you. He transferred your consciousness to this radio-cassette before the Commandant... 'Shut up! Palmer is dealing the substance. 'We were going to have children.' How? For God's sake, you are a portable TV. Don't you see? Come with us to Mallorca, little fly. 'It was the two of us. 'Turn me towards the window, please. 'How is this possible?' I can't leave you here, don't you see? 'You must leave, Malin.' You know, Johnny, the entire universe is like a viscoelastic mattress. In a few seconds, the mattress regains its shape and the imprint of the body vanishes. Hey, for the glory of our lord, the Reverend Roy! 'Thank God. Have mercy. 'Take me to the truth. 'It's my last chance.' Don't worry, my friend. The Reverend Roy, who is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, will take you with him. Hurry up! We don't have much time. [Roy] Where shall we find the truth? [All] Body of Jesus Christ. - It's not the human body. - No, not the human body. No, it's not the human body. He comes from the kingdom of vegetables. No, it's not the human body. He comes from the kingdom of vegetables. The oppressed ones, the slaves are free in the kingdom of God. Far beyond the stars. In 1997. The cops! [Woman] Bastards! Here! Here! The kid! - Come on, give it to the kid! - No, I don't want it. Give it to the kid. Here, Reverend! Here, Reverend! Here, Reverend! Here! Here! [Gunshots continue] Gagano! What are you doing here? 'There's no time to lose, Roy. 'What's all this charade about?' I synthesized the doses that will finally get us out of here. See you in MIT. Go back to life... together with the truth. She's a bee that gets lost with the changing wind, she's a fish. [Gunshots] The Reverend escaped again. Shit! He was faster once again. [Officer] Mr. President! - Burn down the place. - There might be survivors, sir. Come see this, Mr. President. Do as I say. Burn it all down, that's an order! Oh, no! Jesus Christ. What the hell is this? Sir, they were packaging the substance in fish cans. Those bastards! How? They've been using a ghost company from Long Beach California, sir. Sir, you're not gonna believe this. Reverend Roy was Chico Panero! What? Who the hell is Chico Panero? We don't know, sir. Damn. Shit! Chico Panero! Bring me all the information on Chico Panero! Find all the intel and bring it to me! I've been awake for more than twenty minutes. - Who is Roy Mascarone? You? - No, that would be me! Here he is. Let me just... - OK, your check. - Oh, thank you. There you go. - Thank you. Bye! - Thank you. Bye. Commandant. I'm still at your service. Operation Jungle. You're still confused, sir. It's me. Agent D. T. Gagano. You have shown some paranoid symptoms during the experiment. If you experience symptoms, please contact us. It's very important that you contact us. Understand? [Coughing] Here is your check. Thanks for participating. - [Horn blares] - Hey! Excuse me, Roy. Do you know how to get to the highway? Yeah, man, I'm heading that way. Just follow me! Sweetie, come on! We're late. The pizzeria should be open by now. [Gagano] I got the money. Now we can open the kickboxing academy!
