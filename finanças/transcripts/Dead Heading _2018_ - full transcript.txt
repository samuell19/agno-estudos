- A very good morning, ladies and gentlemen, I trust you've had a restful night's sleep. The local time is eight a.m., we are an hour and a half from London Heathrow. We'll be passing the cabin serving breakfast shortly, thank you. - Thank you. - What? It was an accident. - Oh, that's okay then. Accidents do happen, sir. Accident my ass. - Morning, can I get you a coffee? - Yes, please. - My home brew. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Okay. - Oh, bless, poor thing. We'll be there in a couple of hours. Hang in there. Mel, have you got that bag? We'll pop it in here. I'll give you those. I'll be back in a few moments to take any used ones, okay? - Blimey, that poor girl's been blowing like a volcano. - Oh, yeah. Not a lot of breakfast being eaten at her end of the plane. Poor thing. - Flight attendants, 20 minutes until landing, please. - Oh my goodness sir, I am so sorry. Are you okay? - You smashed me nose. - Must have been an accident. Touch me again, and it won't be. - Flight attendants prepare for landing. - Oh, we're landing now, sir. We'll get that nose seen to when we get to the terminal, okay? Is your seat belt on? There's a good chap. Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has signaled that we are now in our final descent. The seat belt sign is now illuminated, the toilets are now out of use. Please make sure that your seat backs and tray tables are in their full, upright position and the arm rests are down. Make sure the seat belt is securely fastened, and any carry on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you, or in the overhead bins. Please turn off all electronic devices until we are safely parked at the gate. Thank you. - Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to London Heathrow where the local time is 9:30 a.m. and the temperature is 19 degrees celsius. On behalf of the captain and cabin crew, we hope you've had a relaxing flight with us. It's been a pleasure to look after you during this flight, and we hope to be of service to you again soon. Please do have a safe on with journey, and a very pleasant day. Thank you, and a very good morning. - So, Anna, what are your plans for this evening? I was wondering if you wanted to come out for a few drinks with the rest of us? - No, I think I'll just lay low, get some sleep. I've been turned around more than usual this week, and I've got a new dog that barks all night, so really tired. - I was hoping we'd get that drink you promised me a few months ago. - Sorry, Steve. I guess I can't drink with other men anymore. - Wow, when did that happen? - Last month, whirlwind romance. When you know it's right, you've just got to dive in. - Well, he's a lucky guy. Just imagine what could have happened if we'd had that drink together earlier. - You're right Steve, I can only imagine. - I'll leave you to rest. Text you later. Dodged a bullet there, again. Well played. - Morning, Anna Lawson checking in please. - Anna Lawson? Can I check, how are you spelling that please? - Your kidding, right? Anna A-N-N-A, Lawson L-A-W-S-O-N. - I'm so sorry Ms. Lawson, but we don't have a booking for you. - I've just got off a seven hour flight with no sleep, my third this week and you're telling me that my name isn't in your stupid machine? - I'm sure we can sort this out. I'll organize a room for you now. - That would be a great idea, wouldn't it? - Are you okay, Anna? - Steve! - Happy to say your booking has been authorized. Here's your room key. - That was easy. Thank you. Have a great night Steve. - And you. Hi. - Can I help you sir? - I'm sorry, she's very tired. - That perfectly understandable Sir. Thank you. - Mind you, I'd better be on that machine of yours. - Awesome. Another bland hotel room. Not too bad. Ah, fuck! Stupid bitch. Simon! - Hello darling. - Hey gorgeous. - How'd the flight go? - Ugh, the usual. Had a girl vomit on descent, and the hot water boiler broke again. - Oh no, so no coffee and tea! I bet that went down well. - We managed. We used the one in first class, but, I had to keep walking around loads to refill it. Very annoying. - Oh poor baby. You're in the hotel now are you? - Yeah. It's okay. Just had a nice bath. Plan on getting lots of sleep. - Yeah, good idea. You have been working long shifts, babe. - Yeah, but I'll be back in 48 hours and you can take me on that picnic you promised me on the hill. How's Barney? I miss him too. - Well, apart from the barking all night he's cool. He loves his new bed, not sure next door's cat likes him though. - Oh, well, he'll learn to stay away I'm sure. - Look, you get some deserved rest. I'll chat later. I love you so much. - I love you too, cant wait to hold you again. - Oh, me too. Barney's no substitute. His breath smells. Take care, hugs. - Hugs back, speak soon. - Love you. - Love you. No way. Mm. Simon. Just get some sleep. Wow, all afternoon. Club sandwich, pizza, chicken Tikka Masala. Yuck! Restaurant time. Popular place. - Yes, it is a tad quiet tonight, table for one? - Yeah, if you can squeeze me in? - I'll try my best. Would you like to follow me? Can I get you anything to drink? - Ah, red wine? - We have a great Shiraz. - Perfect. - Large or small? - Definitely a large. Thanks. - Are you ready to order? - Yeah, I'll have the medium rare filet steak with peppercorn sauce. - With chips or potatoes? - Chips. Thanks. Chips. - Can I get you another drink? I tell you what, should we just give you the bottle? On the house. - That's very nice of you, thank you very much. - Enjoy. - Thanks. - Is everything alright for you? - Oh yeah, it's great. - Would you like the desert menu? - No, thanks, I'm full up. I think I'll just chill at the bar. - Right. - Hi, I'm Paul, I noticed you-- - Did you? Did you notice me, Paul? And now that your friends have you all the way over here on your own, what's the plan, Paul? The plan? Well, I don't really-- - You don't? Surely you have a plan to seduce me. So what is it? Are you funny? A great conversationalist? Widely traveled? Rich? Awesome in bed? Come on now, Paul, don't leave me hanging. What is it? Let's hear it. - I just thought you were pretty, so I wanted to say hi. - Here's what's gonna happen, Paul. I'm gonna laugh at one of your jokes, and play with my hair in a flirty way, and now you're gonna turn to your friends, give a thumbs up, smile. Oh, come on now, Paul. This is your big moment. You're getting the girl. I'm so hot for you, Paul. There. Now you look like a big man to your friends, don't you? Honestly, you're too young for me, Paul. But how about exchanging that glass of wine for a kiss? - Yes. Yes, please. - Seeing as you're so polite. Mm. Not bad, Paul. You'll make someone very happy one day. Now trot off back to your friends and don't bug me anymore, okay? Paul? My wine? - Thank you. - Okay, tell them I'm taken. - Hey, how did you do that? - I don't know, I don't know, but well, she's taken. - Oh, well, next time. - Why not? - Good evening. - Good evening to you. - What would you like? - Shiraz please. - And make it a large. I'm on a large, so I... - Okay. Make it a large. That's very nice of you. - I kind of got the impression that we're both a bit lost tonight, especially if our books are our only company, and there's something really wrong with that, so I don't know. - You're right, it's almost sad. I'm Anna. - I'm John, it's nice to meet a fellow saddo. - Saddo? I said almost sad. - Well, can I just say, I watched you take that young guy apart earlier. Very skillfully done, by the way. I'm really impressed, but now I'm totally terrified of you. - Oh, you saw that? I just get fed up with young guys seeing me as an easy target, so sometimes I fight back. I see it as sport. They're pretty, but there's nothing there that interests me. You on the other hand are at least in my demographic of intrigue. - Your demographic? - So you like older guys? Okay, well am I safe? - So John, reading in hotel bars says to me that you're in them a lot. - Well, if the truth be told, yes. I spend three days a week traveling, and I see a lot of faceless hotels. Incredibly boring, but I do have a very exciting meeting tomorrow in this very hotel. I'm actually at a conference, shh. - Ah, that is exciting. You have to love a good conference. What do you do? - I work in the world of travel safety. Well, I basically make sure that people don't die, or don't get injured, so I spend a lot of time making sure they get home safely. - Your in the car industry? - No, I wish. No, I'm in the incredibly sexy world of traffic management software. I told you it was sexy. I basically make sure the traffic lights work. - Oh, well, without traffic lights, there would be-- - Anarchy, chaos, death, destruction in all corners of the world. - Well, to traffic management software, saving us all from certain disaster. - So you know about my incredibly sexy life. Tell me about you. What do you do? - I'm in the business of pandering to people. I try to stop children crying so it doesn't wind everyone else up, and generally all the time everyone around me is fed up and can't wait to get away from me. - Wait, you sound exactly like my old high school teacher. I knew I recognized you. I knew it. - Close, feels like it sometimes. I'm airline cabin crew. - Oh, I never would have gotten that from your description. So I take it you're not in love with your job right now or? - It's okay. I think I've just been doing it too long. Now I just see sick bags, and people stuffing their faces, and trying to get a bit drunk to pass the time. - Well how about a toast, to sick bags, to annoying passengers, and children, crazy children, annoying children, to the unsung heroes of the sky, air hostesses. - Ah, now technically these days we're all cabin crew. Less sexist apparently. - Okay, let me rephrase. To possibly, the loveliest, most charming, cabin crew, AKA air hostess, in the entire world and that I've ever met. That's not too sexist, is it? Cheers. - My round I believe. Same again? Sexy? I mean, sexist. - Why not? I'm only gonna be falling asleep in the conference anyway. Ah. You know, they say you can tell a lot about someone by the books they read. - Well, I love this book. I take it everywhere with me. It's a story of passion, jealousy, the inner monster the need to know that you're the only person for someone. - Sounds good. Makes mine sound really sad. - Go on, what is it? - Nah. - I showed you mine, it's time to see yours. - It's the Bible. I know it's the age old story of good versus evil, and how we should all live our lives, but I just thought, give it a go. - Are you religious? - Me? No. No, I just ahh, I just saw it in the room and I thought, why not? Give it a go, give it a read. - And what do you think? - What do I think? I think, in all honestly, there is something we can all learn from it. - Your making this up aren't you? - Yes. - It's a book about cars isn't it? - Well, I'm trying to upgrade my rep car, and that was the best start. You are an amazing woman. Tell me. Do you think this could be anything? Anything? - Newly off the market. I'm sorry to say. - Why I not see that? Well, okay. Cliche moment. He's a lucky guy, he is. - Is there a significant other in your life? - There was, but until recently, she... Well, we were gonna do the whole marriage and kids thing, but then, I wasn't ready. And she left. - I'm sorry to hear that. - No, don't be. I mean, that's the way things go, right? - Unfortunately, I have to go, I've got more whiny passengers and screaming kids tomorrow, and I'll probably have a hangover on top. - Of course, makes sense, makes sense. - Well, you have saved me from the dullest night ever. I haven't laughed that much for ages. - It was a pleasure. - Maybe in a different life. - Another life it is. Okay. - That is a lot of pennies. Have a lovely evening, John. I hope we bump into each other again soon. - Take care. Fuck it. Let's celebrate. Champagne. Bring one bottle, two glasses, you're joining me. - I may have over done it, a lot What would your husband think? Fuck off Angela! A stranger. Very exciting. John. Oh my god. Bless him. Oh. Men. No way. John. Hello. - Hello. Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you, I just... - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - What's up? - Nothing, I was just... I was kind of feeling kind of lonely, and I thought that maybe you would be too, and I brought this. I thought you'd fancy a nightcap. - Nightcap? - Mm-hm. - Didn't we have loads of drink only a few hours ago? - So we did. This was a bad idea. Ah, so, thank you for a good night, but, I'm gonna go. Thanks for cheering me up.

So last night, mister perfect turned out to be a dick. Good kisser, but oh my god he was so full of himself. So I ditched him in one of the pubs. The pilots were their usual letchy self's trying it on and Steve was constantly talking about you, is she happy with her new chap? So, what have you been up to? You caught up on your sleep, yet? You can't hide in here all day, babes. You're awfully quiet. Babes, you look terrible, you look ill. - My head hurts. - You're burning up. Better get some more rest, see how you feel later. Hm? Please get better we really need you on that flight if we can. Wish I had your cleaners, smells so clean here. I can't even get a fresh towel on my side of the hotel. - Thank you Angela, what would I do with you? - Text if you want anything and keep warm. Okay, and get room service if you need it. - Thank you. - Bye. - Ah! How we going to get rid of you? How about like a dead goldfish? Think. How to get rid of this body. We're gonna need more time. Hi, Jason? It's Anna Lawson cabin crew on a layover in London. Yeah, hi. Over the last couple of days I've been coming really ill. I'm all heady and stuffed up, you know, headaches, shivers, the usual passed on from a passenger. Yeah, I know. So, sorry Jason about that. I just don't think I'm going to be able to fly later with all this pressure in my head. I was just wondering if it's possible to lay over another night? You know, to try and shift it? Angela Devaux is aware of how under the weather I am. Oh, thank you so much, Jason. I owe you, you're the best. Yeah, I will take plenty of medication and get better for tomorrow. Yeah. Sorry. So sorry. Oh, Jason, could you express to the hotel that I need to keep this room? I just really don't feel up to changing rooms right now. Oh, you're a sweetheart. Thank you, Jason.

Can't risk it. John. Put the seat down John! Gross. You're not even named John? Oh, you lying asshole. Get a grip. Make him disappear. Like you were never here. Oops. I hope you backed up your data, John, or whoever you are. I'll pay you back, John. Not. Hey! Who the hell are you? - Alright, love. What do you want? - Maintenance, room below is getting some horrible smells. Probably overflow on your bath's blocked. - You don't want to go in there. - It'll only take a second love. Oh Jesus. What is this? - It's a dead guy, love. No one is coming. No one can hear you. No one cares. - Maintenance, room below is getting some horrible smells. Probably overflow on your bath's blocked. - You don't want to go in there! - Oh, Jesus. Hello, Paul speaking. Oh, you're joking. Yeah, I'll come straight down. Yeah, alright. Tools. Sorry about this.

And we don't think you've left the room for a while, I hope you don't mind I took the liberty of bringing you some supplies whilst you convalesce. Hotel's compliments of course. Would you like me to bring it in for you? - Oh, no, it's okay, thanks. It's not nice in here. - I understand fully. Horrible things colds. Nasty. - Mm, thanks.

Here, let me help you. - Oh, it's fine. You don't pack light do you? - I do love shoes. Thank you. It's really nice to meet such a handsome stranger so early in the day. - You are spectacular, you know. Do you think I could give you my card?

I just want to check we're getting you on the right bus. Where are you expecting to go today? - We're going to Dover, then tonight we're going to Switzerland, and that for a couple of days, and then we're going to Germany this week. - Perfect, sounds amazing.

Stand, slowly and move towards me. - Why do you keep doing this?
