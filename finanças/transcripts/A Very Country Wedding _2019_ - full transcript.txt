One... together. Two, together... Ugh. One, together... Two, together. One, together. Now I've never known you to have trouble walking? I'm going to mess this up. What? Look at you all cute as a puppy in a tux. How could you possibly mess anything up? I can't get the walk right. Ahhhh. I see. Well it just so happens that I had the pleasure of being a flower girl exactly thirteen times when I was a little girl. Thirteen? Big family. Come on. Now I assume you're doing that count, then together nonsense? Rookie mistake. You want to get this right, you follow me. And step. Wanna try again? Okay. And step. And step. You did great. Thanks Jolene! Well, I officially bestow upon you, my flower girl duties. I won't let you down. There's no way you possibly could. I think Mom would've really liked her. Mom would have yelled at you for putting this off so long. You think a year is too long, Bartholomew? No. But Mom would have met Jeannette and told you to book the church that weekend. Yeah, you're right. Gentlemen. Hey Bart. Great job getting rid of getting rid of the paparazzi. Not a camera inside. All right, sentimental stuff, I know, really isn't... Our thing. I have never felt more uncomfortable than I do right now. I know, I know. Just, just let me get through it. Wow, there's paper. You even wrote it down. Give me a minute. You know, ah, when we were young, I thought I was going to be a big famous country star. Then you came along. So I thought that I'd try my hand at football. Then Bart here, he came along. So I realized that I was never going to be a star. So I decided to give up. Is this where you hit us? It was you. You showed me it wasn't about being better. It was not about us competing against each other. It was us against the world. Being brothers. What are you doing? I'm going to go out there and my big old stupid eyes are going to be all swollen up. I just want to say thank you. For being my brother. I had something made for us. You trashed my first guitar? Seriously? That was my guitar! I learned how to play on this guitar. It's symbolism. Hold on. Hey, you know, if it's the same guy you hired to make these, I still have my first car if you'd like to turn that into some pants, or something. Mary? Billy! I am so glad you answered. Nice of you to finally stop avoiding my calls. I'm not avoiding your calls. Oh, sure you were. I have been calling you for weeks, leaving long detailed messages. Did you not get them? They were very important. Mary, just get to the point. You must look nice. All dressed up. How do you know I'm dressed up? Because I'm smarter than you, Billy. So what did Zane go with? Just a bow tie or a tight T-shirt for the big day? Mary, don't ruin this it for him. Or them. What? Ruin Zane and Jeannette's wedding day? The way you two ruined my career? Whoa. I am not even thinking about you and Zane actually. I'm just thinking about business. We didn't ruin your career. We just gave you time to focus on other artists. Well, they voted me off the board because of you, so I figured, why not use you two to get me back in. Zane fulfilled his contract. We're out. We can't help you anymore. Oh, my sweet Billy. I think ahead. I am so kind that I left the board of directors a very valuable parting gift when I left. So valuable in fact, that when they open it, they're going to have no choice but to let me back in. What did you do? I would read the fine print on Zane's old amended contract, if I was you. You changed it. Now who's the smart one. Okay, you're going to want to get your brother out of his fancy clothes and on to some transportation. And you'd better hurry. Your brother goes on in just a few hours. I'm emailing you the details right now. Mary, please. Not today. Looking forward to seeing you Billy. Okey dokey. So everybody is almost here, even Uncle Earl, who I am going to take credit for because I told him the wedding is taking place in two hours. Mom, what's wrong? Nothing, it's just... You look so beautiful. Do I normally look that bad? No, no. I think that I have been so focused on making sure this day goes perfectly, that it's just hitting me now that my baby is getting married. Mom. Okay, we are not getting absurd. This is not happening. I'm not going to cry. Hey! Jeannette, sorry, sorry. Hey Jeannette. We need to talk. I'm sorry. It is bad luck to see the bride before the wedding! I'm afraid I already brought the bad luck. What is it? It looks like Mary left me a trap after I left her label for Billy's. What kind of trap? Wait a second. Who's Mary? She's the head of Zane's old record label. Or she was. After Zane and I left to start our own, they voted her out. So what's the problem? She purposely booked me on three more shows as soon as she found out Billy was stealing me away. Okay. So, you play the shows, finish out the contract and then you're done with her for good, right? She intentionally booked them over our wedding. You've got to be kidding me. How did nobody know about this before? She arranged them in secret and just announced them last night. Zane's first show is in Ohio... tonight. Honestly, if I didn't hate her so much I'd admire her horribleness. Okay, no. Stop. This is silly. Just explain to her that you are getting married, and then you'll do the shows at another time. I wish it were that easy. It is that easy! Sweetheart, this is your wedding. No, they don't care about that. Zane will be in breach of contract. He could get sued. Not to mention halting any future shows you want to play. Yeah. Look Mary did this knowing full well it would cripple Billy's new label. You know what, I'll figure something else out. I'll start again. I'm not going to ruin your day. Go. Are you sure? Get on the plane and play the shows. You can set it all up, right? I'm on it. Listen, I promise I will have him back as soon as I can. Thank you, Jeannette. Good. We'll move the wedding to the end of the summer. No. This is insanity. You do not walk out of your own wedding! Everybody is out there waiting... Mom. It's okay. It's just a wedding. You are the greatest thing that ever happened to me. You know that, right? I do. Now get on that plane. You're going to be late. So this is what's holding up the show, huh. Some pre-wedding kisses? Uh-oh. He's getting there! And yelling at me is not going to make him travel any faster! Hello everyone. Hi. I'd love to tell you that we're almost ready to start. But I'm afraid something's come up. Now first things first. Everyone's A-okay. Unfortunately, we all know life doesn't give us everything the way we want it. So there is going to be a wedding. Just not today. And I promise, it's for a really good reason. All we need to know is those kids are very much in love. And they're doing exactly what they need to do to start their lives together in the best way possible. Hurry back so you can marry me! I wouldn't miss it for the world. Well, I'm glad it went well. Well, we were about forty minutes late so the promoters weren't too thrilled. But we did put on a couple extra encores for the fans so it was a pretty good show. What's going on over there? The new label hooked me up with a real first-class ride over to the other show. How am I possibly qualified to drive this? Hey, how are things going over there? We're good! Everyone's making the best of it. Even your mom? Of course! You're a terrible liar. Hey, did the painters ever come by and finish up with the design studio? They did. It looks great. Still a long way to go, though. I really wish I could be there to help. Well, just make it for the ribbon-cutting. Hey, got everything? Yeah. I'm really sorry it didn't work out. Ah, don't be sorry. Just come back in August and you can play Jeannette down the aisle then. We're on tour for the rest of the summer. We're leaving in three weeks. Of course you are! Silly me thinking you'd be available. Believe me, I really wish we could. Well, thanks for trying. Now, you guys go out rip up that tour and above all else, behave yourself. Gentlemen first. Always. Give Zane and Jeannette our best okay? You got it. Have fun. You think I could do it? Well, you know I think you can do anything, but just so we're on the same page, what exactly is the thing you are thinking of doing? Maybe you could teach me the piano, and I could play for Mom and Zane? I think that's the single best idea I've ever heard in the whole world. So, you'll do it? Of course. Hold? Again? How much longer do I have to wait? Hi, it's Mary. How can I help? You know who this is. You never would have make anybody else wait this long. I'm sorry. Who's this? Billy... Billy Gunther. Oh, hi Billy. Sorry to keep you waiting. What have you been up to? Well, I've had time to review the fine print, and I see that you concealed an option in Zane's contract. Near the back. Page 32. If triggered, then talent has to stay with the label even longer. Concealed? Woah. I wouldn't say that. I am simply trying to maximize the return on our little investment. It's the kind of thing that can get a person back on the Board. That is so unprofessional. This is Zane's life we're talking about. We never agreed to those terms. Or even discussed them. Billy, calm down. Nobody is forcing you to do anything. It's called an option for a reason. It's like how I didn't force you to take me out to that little Italian restaurant a couple of months ago. You know what, that was a mistake. Really? It didn't feel like a mistake. Especially when we shared that second piece of tiramisu. Mary... what do you plan on doing with this option. I'm sorry, Billy, but that's going to be between you and the new head of the Board. Billy? Billy? How's the house band? Ah, surprisingly good. They said that Mary tried to set me up with some rookie players as sort of the cherry on top. How'd you avoid that? Apparently they have some new guy running the show over there. Some, ah... Chris Water. They said he's trying to force his option on my contract. I thought your contract was done after these shows. Yeah, me too. And that's what Mary told Billy. But surprise surprise, she's gone back on her word. This Chris guy is in control of it now. I guess he thought not giving me a good band would convince me to do whatever he wants. I'll have to swing by and see him when I get back. Well you tell this new guy, Chris Water, that I didn't let you leave our wedding for his benefit! Excuse me just a minute. Oh, I think Jolene wants to say hi. You sure it's Chris Water? Um... Yes ma'am. It says that right here on his card. You heard of him? I've heard of him. And he's not a new guy. He's an old guy. Hold on, is this, ah... Yeah. You just don't worry that cute little head of hair about it. I know exactly where to find him too. I'm going to set this straight for you. Wow, thank you Jolene. Yeah, she's already gone. So, the bad news is, we lost our deposit but the good news is it'll cost double if we do it at the end of summer. Maybe we should just... No! Whatever it costs. All right. I don't care. This is my fault. You do whatever you want. Hey... I really love you. Right back at you. Have a good show. I'll call you when we're on our way back. Okay, bye. You got something you want to say? What makes you think that? You always have the most to say when you're not saying anything at all. Huh. Okay. You know I love Zane. Right? I do. I just wish that the two of you could have started your lives together on the right foot. What was I supposed to do? If I make him stay, I'm selfish. If I let him go, I lose my wedding. I know. I was going to lose either way. It was just a matter of how much. I know. I'm wrong and you are absolutely right. You made the only choice you could. I'm sorry. I just... No more from me. All right? Anything you need? Thank you. Yeah, all right. All right. Let's start planning a wedding. Again. Well, that there looks like another hundred dollars to me. What do you think? I can still catch up. You know, I almost feel bad taking your money every week. Almost. Double or nothing? How can I say 'no' to taking more of your money? Come on, what is this? What is the point of paying for a private course when they let people walk all over it? Hey! Excuse me little lady! This is a private golf course. You're going to have to move your... If you don't want to eat those expensive capped teeth, I suggest you don't call me little lady, or finish that sentence. I'd be careful, Tristan. She's got a pretty lethal right cross. How are you Jolene? Nope! I can't say hello? No you may not. I'm here because you're holding Zane Gunther's option. Now he's going to finish these three shows for you and you're going to cut him loose. Non-negotiable. Understand? Done. If Zane doesn't want my help, I wish him well. Great! Now you can just go back to being rich and have this whole place to yourself like the spoiled little child that you are. One condition. What did I just say? You still writing? Why? I got this new kid. She's real sweet. She needs a little guidance. Someone to help her get started out on the right foot. Now I assume you're still the best? Well then, what do you say? And if I help you, you'll let Zane go? I'll even pay you for your time. Of course you will. So this kid - is she nice? The nicest. A real peach! And, I won't even be there. Scout's honor. I'll help you for one week. Then you're on your own. Got it? How can I say no to a great deal like that? One week! I've never seen you lose a negotiation like that. Yeah, that's probably why she got so much off me in the divorce. Let's make this next shot triple or nothing. Huh? I've got a feeling this is going to be an expensive week for me. Come on! Put your hands up! Hey! Outta my way! Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop the song! Hey! Hey! Hey! You all right? - Yeah. - Okay. All right. Come on guys. Stop the roughhousing. This is a concert not a wrestling match! We're here to have a party with all of our closest friends. This is Country! Now let's have a good time. Come on! Hey, you know what? They almost trampled this little thing right here. Maybe we should bring her up her on stage, right? Come on! Come on. Don't be afraid. There you go. All right. You see this face? This is the face you almost squashed. What's your name? If they know your name, it'll be icing on the guilt cake. Meagan. All right Meagan, and I'll tell you what? Why don't you take a seat right next to me? Hey, let's get her a stool. Come on. Bring one out. Come on. Let's give her a hand. All right. Why don't you tell me your favorite song? And please say one of mine. When I Could Call You Mine. Well, that's the least I can do. All right, guys. I'm just glad that girl's okay. Yeah, me too. I didn't think someone getting stomped at one of my shows would go over so well. It's only been up for a few hours, and it's already got two million views. Wow, that's fast. It's a good thing, right Bart? It's a great thing. Billy said several media outlets have already picked up the clip. Hey, they you go. Here. Really appreciate it. Yeah, no problem. Well, I'm glad she didn't get hurt. Pretty little thing. Now, you know of course there is no way I will be commenting on that young lady's looks right? There's nothing wrong with pointing out someone's beauty. All right. Did I mention that I'm super excited about tomorrow! You guys will be back in time, right? It's really important to me. It's the third most important day of my life, after Quinn's birth and our wedding. I know. Now, look, we've got a six hour drive ahead of us. So we'll be in late. But, all I need is one cup of coffee and I'll be there cheering loudest next to you when you cut that ribbon. Wow! There's already another five thousand views. Nice work bro! Oh, hey baby girl! Hey, ah, shhhh! I have to be quiet. I don't want my Mom to hear me. Got it! I'll be as quiet as possible. I saw a video online, and I think there's too many keys for you to teach me for the wedding. So maybe you could just teach me the middle ones? Okay, so here's the deal. I had to leave town for a little while, but I told my daughter you'd be stopping by the house to practice. So, I prerecorded some beginner lessons for you, okay? So, you start with those then I'll be back to help you before you know it. Okay. I'll get my Nana Suze to take me. But, do you think that Sammy will mind if we're there? Not one little bit. And I'll be home before you can say "Jolene, my fingers are hurting." Why would I say that? Oh, you'll see. Talk later, Quinn. Okay. Thank you, Jolene. Anything for you. Nana Suze! What happened? Nothing. We have a mission. We do? Come on. Let's go. Okay. Right behind you. Okay, but if I wear my hair up then when I look at the photos of the opening, all I'm going to see is my ears. Oh come on! I love your ears. Bye Mom! Wait, where are you going? Ah, secret mission. Nana Suze! You failed the first part of secret missions. The 'secret' part. Apologies. We'll be back soon. I think? Okay, so I guess I'll wear the sandals. What does a professional, store-owning interior designer wear at her opening? Hey. Hey. Yeah? I'm crazy proud of you. Okay? You worked your butt off and you deserve this. The store's going to be great. Thank you. That means a lot to me. I'm going to let you go so we can get home. See you tonight. Yes you will. Hey, the video cuts off. Did she get a peck on the cheek or just a hug at the end? Nice try. She got a firm handshake, and an 'enjoy the rest of the show'! Don't worry, Billy. I'll tell him. Sorry, this video is insane! Everyone wants a piece of you. Ah, okay. I gotta go. I love you. Bye. Love you too. Bye. Billy says Radio KBL is predicting this is could come close to 5 million in the next few hours at this rate. Radio KBL said that? Really? Yeah. The Viola and Bear Show. Roar! Actually, they just invited you on again. Well, absolutely! I love Viola and Bear. Billy told me to pass. They wanted you for tomorrow morning, to take advantage of the video. Bart. Be honest with me. What do we do? We'd be cutting it close to getting to the opening. Yeah, you're right. Except these viral videos don't happen all the time right? Are you sure that's what you want? I mean, how long can an interview really take? Ten minutes? But you're already exhausted. Nah. Come on, I'll have two coffees. You're driving. Let's go! Woo Hoo! Sweetie, I don't think Jolene's even home. Sammy will let us in. Well do I at least get to know why we're here? Nothing personal Nana Suze, but it's more of a musician thing. You wouldn't understand. Oh. All right. I'll just read a book while you do your thing. Hey Suzanne. Hey Quinn. Did I ever mention you really look like a Quinn? Your mom did a great job naming you. Thanks! Do I look like a Sammy? I don't think I look like a Sammy. I feel like I'm more of a Frank. I'm thinking of legally changing it. Come in. So here's the piano. I set up all your lessons. Mom said you have to learn pretty quick, huh? Yeah. I want to play for my mom and Zane at the wedding. Well I wish I could help you but sadly, I didn't get my Mom's talents. If you could lock up when you're done that would be great. Sure. You're not going to stay? No, I got roped into refereeing a full contact chess match. It's a long story. You know how it is. Sure. Good luck, Quinn! Looks pretty complicated. I think I'll be fine. How hard can it be? Hmm, well. I'll just sit here. Call me if you need me. Okay, thanks. So you want to be a rock star huh? Well the first step is you've got to prove you've got the grit! So go ahead and give me your best attitude face! I'll wait. That's the attitude! Now, I think we should start with something simple. Like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Spoiler alert, you'll also learn how to play the Alphabet Song. We'll call this Lesson One! I don't have enough time. I think I'm just going to skip ahead. Whatever you think is best. Now when we sustain, you can hear that I augment the C seven over the minor run. Go ahead, you try. Seven? I didn't know there was math in this? I think you might be trying to run before you can walk. I know, but I have to learn. Can I give it a go? Maybe we can figure something out together. Oh! Oh, that does sound cool! I can see why you'd want to play this. Let me try something. You can play? I guess I can? Why didn't you say anything before? Well, I didn't want to interfere with your plans. - You can teach me? - I could so teach you! Okay. But while I'm teaching you, that's means we're going back to Twinkle Twinkle. All right? Now sit up straight. Two hands. Give them a shake. All right. Okay. That was... great. I'm just going to tinker a bit on my end. Hey, teddy bear? Oh! I do not believe my eyes! Chris told me you were coming, and I thought for sure he was full of it. Well he is. But I'm here. - How're you doing? - I'm good, I'm great. Great! How are the girls? They're good. Madeline's going to high school. - What? - I know. Oh my goodness... Mike! Mike! Oh, ah... Sorry Cake. Ah... This is Jolene. Chris sent her here to help. Ah, ah... not you. Not you, of course. She's her to help me. Hi Kate. I'm Jolene. Nice to meet you. It's Cake. Did she say Cake? Like the food? Uh huh. Yeah. It's C, A, Cake emoji, E. It's Cake. Hey, ah, Cake. Why don't we take it from the top again so Jolene can see where she has to help... me. Okay. Ooh this sounds really cool! Yeah. Just, give it a second. She insisted on writing her own lyrics. Bless her heart. Get that cake! - Say no more. - Yeah. So what did you think about that? Oh, I thought it was great. Great job. Ah, you're welcome! Oh! Hi Chrissy! Hi there darling. Sounding great as always! I'm just dropping off coffee, I'm not staying. Chrissy? It's cute right? I thought you said this girl was a peach? She is! Just... Just a touch sour. How many people did you ask to help her before you came to me? Oh, come on now, you know you are always my number one! Mike? All of them. Thank you Mike. All right, look. The reason I didn't ask you is because I thought you'd say no. Well we both agree on that. Okay, okay. Last plea, all right. Just go in there. Show her how it's done. After that, you're off the hook, all right. I'll even give you the Cake bonus. Yeah, that's the bonus you get for working with Cake. Great. Thanks again, Mike. And Zane? He'll be as free as you were the day you walked out of that divorce court. Fine. Give me the lyrics. No no no, not that one. Give her number three. Cake darling, we're just going let Jolene go in there for a few minutes. Give that beautiful voice of yours a rest. Huh. Thank you! Woo! I did two in a row that time. Mike! Mike! I thought you had to put the auto tune on after? How come you put it on while this lady's singing? That's just how they did it back in the day. Um, I'm afraid this just isn't going to work out. Now hang on. We had a deal. Cake darling, we're going to go ahead and find somebody else for you to work with. All right. It's whatever. Text me, Chrissy. I'm leaving. What do you mean you're leaving? I sang the song and you said it didn't work. I said it's not going to work for her because it's your song now. That is, unless you don't want to have a hit song again. Well, I... would change the bridge a bit. And make it a minor key. Well, of course you would. It wouldn't be a Chris and Jolene song if you just left it the way I wrote it. And it wouldn't be a hit if I did. No argument there. Well, from the top? Fine! She loves me. And that is the latest hit from Zane Gunther! Our favorite singer-songwriter here at Radio KBL. The man whose songs melt your heart, the musician of the decade, Zane Gunther is sitting across from me. Nice to have you here! Thanks for having me back. You know I'm a huge fan of the show. Is it because we have the cutest faces in radio? Well, I do. Well, she has the cutest face in radio. You, my friend, have a face for radio. Ohhhh! Ohhhhhh! Okay, for those of you who have maybe hit your head, or enjoy really long naps, Zane, here, has been all over the Internet. And not just for his music. Yeah, Zaner, tabloids are saying you left your girl at the altar. Is that true? No! Absolutely not. Look, we just had to postpone the wedding. For a bit. A bit? So, like a week? Or a month? Or ten years? No no no no. Look we have it all figured. It's just a little delay. Sure. Happens all the time to couples. At the altar. Yeah, all the time. Well, you heard it here first, ladies! Zane Gunther is back on the market. Ladies, you did not hear that here first! That is not true! You played a beautiful show for us here the other night. Yeah, and then something happened. I assumed millions of girls trying to touch that gorgeous hair. Bear, you want to touch it, don't you? You know I want to touch it! You know I'm a sucker for that. I actually had that same style hair. But seriously. Someone got trampled? Yeah, you know, the show got a little rowdy and this poor woman got knocked over. Ohhh! Just between us - how hot was she? Ah, stop! But I will say, I saw the video. She was a very attractive woman. Look, I just wanted to make sure no one was getting hurt. Okay? Oh! Nice dodge, Zane! Great dodge! Where you a boxer? Hey Jeannette. Yeah, we're at KBL Radio. Yeah, they saw the video and they asked us to come by. It's a quick fifteen minutes and we're on our way. No, I understand. It's a big deal. Is it going well? He's doing great. I promise, we'll be there. We're out of here in ten minutes. Tops. Okay. Just meet us at the store then. Quinn and I will be leaving at noon. The mayor will be there at two to cut the ribbon. Yeah, no problem! We'll be there with time to spare. Okay. Bye. So long story long. Your song was the reason why I got a kiss. I didn't know you're mom was a fan of my music. - Oh! Yeah, you are a sad sad man. Tell me something I don't know already, Vi. Okay Zane, I see your boy out there, pointing at his watch like a madman. Yeah yeah yeah. Look, you guys know I'm a huge fan of the show, however I do have somewhere very important I need to be. Okay. But first, it's time for... Drop in! Oh! So for all you listening on the radio. We just reunited this lovely young lady... What is your name? Meagan. Meagan! So nice to meet you. Go on and grab a seat next to Zane. Put your headphones on and get real close to the microphone, sweetie. It's nice to see you again. It's nice to see you too. Oh, now Meagan and Zane. I know we just sprung this on you. But good gravy, don't these two make a cute couple? Look, I'm not into mushy stuff but even I'm a little over the moon here. Ah, look. I appreciate you saying that but I really do need to... You know what? For everyone listening you need to hit us up online because it is time for us to play What's That Baby Gonna Look Like? Waaaah! Hey guys, look, I actually really love this game, but I do need to head out. Totally. Promise we'll make it real quick! Two seconds. Okay. I just wanted to say that I was really nervous when I first met you. And I really am just a big fan. And thank you, again. Hey, it's nothing to worry about, okay? Oh! Look! A little hand on hand action! That's grade school marriage right there! What's the deal Meagan? You two a thing? No. Of course not. But, I mean, I'm game if Zane is? Oh, come on! All of you are the worst! Who's side are you on? And why wouldn't she be! Look at how cute your baby would be! That's pretty great. Although, um... Look, there is someone I'm already seriously in love with. My fiancé. Thanks again. I really do have to go. Let's do a round of likes and dislikes! You first Meagan. Mom, can I get a snack? Sure. - Hi! - Hey! Where's Zane? Well, I don't know. But I'm sure he'll be here soon. Okay. I know where the donuts are! Hey. I'm so sorry. They made me turn my phone off for the interview. Where are you? We're about fifteen minutes out. We're almost there. Okay. I'm really nervous. Hey, you have nothing to be nervous about. This is just the natural next step of your interior design greatness. I hope you're right. Guess I'm kind of excited. I've never done anything like this before, so... Oh. No. Hey, hey. Can you go around it! No, they're turning cars around. What's wrong? Construction. We're completely stuck. Don't you worry. I'll be there. Go! I'll meet you there. What are you doing? Now don't cut that ribbon without me, all right. If I run, I can make it. Zane? Zane? Hello? Hello? Hey, hey! Stop! Stop! Hey, hey! Hi! Thanks for coming. Jeannette? Hi! Thanks so much for coming down, Mayor Hartley. Of course! Always happy to help our town get a little stronger. Well, it's a little early, but we've got tea and coffee inside. Actually due to some changes in the schedule, we're going to need to move the ribbon cutting up. Oh. Okay. Umm... How soon? It's just that I'm waiting for Zane... Well, now would be great. Of course. Yay! Okay, come on! Here we go! Hope you're close. Stop the car! Stop the car! Stop the car! Zane! I love you! Marry me! I always love seeing members of our community make their dreams come true. And today, it is my great pleasure to help Mrs. Jeannette Gunther on this journey. Oh, um, I'm not Gunther. Or Mrs. Either. Not yet, anyway. Um... long story. It's Williams. Jeannette Williams. Okay. Ready? And you are open! Come on in, everybody! Zane! Hey, come here. Hey, did you level up in our game while I was gone? Maybe? Okay, I beat your high score. Yeah, I bet you did! Hey. Hey. Quinn. Can you help me take some of this stuff to the back? I am so sorry. You know, I tried to get here. We got stuck in that construction. I ran the rest of the way. I know. It's okay. The Mayor had another engagement, so she had to move this one up. Ah! Look at this! Wow! Looks amazing! Yeah, we had a great turn out. I already booked four consultations. Five. I'm going to need to hire you to redo the RV that Billy got us. Can you afford me? Can I pay in kisses? That's a lot of kisses. What about a down payment? One down, nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine to go. All right! Let's do this! Where are you going? Well, the sooner I get this cleaned up, the sooner we can go to Bella's. I made us a reservation for tonight. Okay. Did you practice? Twice! While she was in the shower. Perfect. Okay. Let's continue. Uh uh uh. Nice straight back. I don't get that part? Why do I have to have a straight back? If, when I'm leaning over, I can just reach the keys better. Seriously? This is how you want to spend your time? Thank you! All right. Let's warm up those fingers. Can you play me a C scale with the right hand? - Yes. - Go. What! What! That is amazing. That is a million times better already. Okay, you seriously need a challenge. Can you play... start on the C again, Skip up to the E, skip up to the G, all the way to the top. And then back down, nice and slow and gentle. - Try that. - Okay. - Yup! Uh huh. Yup. Uh huh. What's the matter peanut? Do you think it's okay if I call Zane "Dad"? I think he would love that. But is that something that you want to do? Well, I don't really remember my dad. But sometimes I see him in like dreams and things like that. Do you think he'd mind? I'll tell you something. I remember your father, very well. And I'm here to say, that he loved you a lot. But so does Zane. And I think that having two people that love you that much is pretty okay. And I'm absolutely positive that your father would agree. He'd like that. Yeah. Yeah, he'd be happy. I want you to try that arpeggio again. Okay. Please follow me right this way. Here's your table. Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks. And I'd just really like to say, Mr. Gunther, that I'm a really big fan. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Enjoy your dinner. So. How was the show? Oh. No. No show talk. I want to hear about everything I missed today. Okay. Well. The opening was good. Mayor Hartley came out, she messed up my name, which was a good start. You're kidding. No. She called me Mrs. Gunther. Oh. Well you're going to be. Oh yeah, speaking of which. I managed to move everything to the end of August so we should be able to... Hi. I'm so sorry. I don't mean to interrupt your dinner. Zane, I just want to say I am your hugest fan. I saw you at the Amphitheater upstate, and then again in New York. We did the back to backs, so it was like I was really there with you. Well, that's very kind of you to say. You're a sweetheart. I don't know how you handle so much attention. Oh... After seeing that cute girl from the concert again on Viola and Bear. Oh. I must have missed that. And then when I saw what your baby would look like with that girl, I tell you what, I was just like... Here you go. Thanks for saying hi. Of course. Enjoy your meal. They brought the girl from the video onto the radio show? They just sprung her on me. It's a radio show, they do crazy stuff like that. I'm not upset. I'm just surprised it didn't come up. Look. It's just the way it works. They get more thumbs up, or whatever, if they make a story out of where there isn't one, you know? Yeah, I get it. Anyway, where was I? We got lucky. The hall had a cancellation on the twenty-ninth of August. I know that's not very much time, but I think it will be enough to let everyone know. What? I got asked to co-headline the Midnight at the Peaks Benefit Concert. Oh. That's incredible right? That's huge for you. Yeah, well, I want to bring you and Quinn with me. No, I can't. I just opened up the store. I can't take time off. We talked about that, right? I know, I know. You're right. There's no other day that works? I can call someone and who could see... No. There's nothing. It's all booked until the end of the year. It's too late. Yeah. Zane, we are your biggest fans! Well, me way more than them. I'm getting married next week. Could we get a pic? It's actually not a really good time. No. It's fine. Thank you so much. I can't believe this is happening. I love all your songs. I know all the words. And maybe one on Tula's phone. And Monica's too. Thank you so much! Can't have too many pictures with Zane. You're so strong. You know the story. This girl isn't anything, right? It's just publicity. Is this our life now? What do you mean? Cameras. Living in the public eye. Are you having second thoughts? No. I love you. But I thought all you wanted was a family. Well, that hasn't changed. You and Quinn are all I want. I'm just going to call them. Get them to cancel the hall for the twenty-ninth. I can say no. No. You should ride this wave. I've just opened up the store. We didn't plan it, but it's... complicated. We'll just... aim for a spring wedding. Maybe you're right. Should I come in, say goodnight to Quinn? She's probably asleep. See you in the morning? Of course. Um... No? No, I'll be here. But I got invited to play The Night Show. They're flying me out at two. That's great. They called just before dinner. I guess, the person they booked had some family emergency so they're asking me to step in, last minute. I was trying to find the right time to tell you. I'll bring breakfast? Then we can take Quinn to the park? Sure. How you doing, big guy? Billy, this is too much. Too much? Give me a clue. The signings, the appearances, the interviews, the the... Paparazzi. All of it. Hey, I know it's hard but the bigger your career gets, the more people want to get to know you. I know. Look, Jeannette and I are used to a certain amount of this, but... it's just been extra hard, trying to reschedule the wedding and, you know, she's trying to open up her store. I can't do it anymore. I know. Hey, let me make a few phone calls. I promise you and Jeannette are going to have your day. All right. - I'll talk to you later. - Thanks. What are you doing on the phone? Aren't you about ready to go on stage? We're on a commercial break. What? Are you nervous? No. Look, I'm working on something. I need your help. Great! The jingle guy just quit and the Bigwigs are on their way up. Where am I going to find someone to sing the Mr. Hair To Stay jingle? Hey you... Janitor. Ever do any singing? Well, does the shower count? I guess we're about to find out! How's he doing? Cute as a button, look at this. Song Boy. Let me see this. You know what? I don't even need it. I may try to hang on to that contract after all. You know I'll kill you right? You know, I do believe you would. Well, here's to letting good things slip away. I'm sure you'll find another big star. We both know that's not what I meant. Well. We were young, and dumb, and way too successful to try to be controlled. Neither one of us knew what we were doing. Wasn't all bad though. I'm just glad that you're a better father than a husband. That was easy. Kids always like me. You helped me learn some really important lessons. You're better than me. I had to learn them two more times. Want to hear the latest mix? Of course. Wow! Sounds really good. You sound really good. Thank you. I got to confess. I asked you to sing on this one because... I kind of wrote it about you. After all these years? You wrote a song about me? No. I write all of them about you. Look, I know I did everything wrong. You know what, it's late. And if I'm being honest all the way around about this, I am not ready to have this conversation. No, no. I completely understand. Sorry. No no no. It's okay. But I'm going to go. Can I see you again? I don't know how to answer that. So I'm always letting my Zaney perform because he lights up the stage. Don't you. Ah, that's very kind of you saying "Meagan". Uh, okay, thank you. I'm going to get back to you on that. That okay? Whoa, Whoa, Wow! Zane, I've suddenly fallen, again. Why don't we try to finish the... Whatever... Um... Hey. I thought this show was live? Yeah. It is! But there's a delay. You must be watching the last sketch. Call me crazy, but I think this guy has a crush on you. Yeah, he keeps inviting me to go bowling. I have no idea why. I do not understand these people. Did you have fun? Yeah, I did. But I am so glad it's over. I just want to get home to you and Quinn. Sounds like quite the celebration over there. What was that? I said it sounds like you're having fun! They're all very nice. Yes. I'll see you tomorrow? Billy booked me for a signing at the mall. I think I'll be home late. Are you there? Hey, can you hear me? Yeah. I heard you. Jeannette? Can you hear me? I said I heard you! I'm trying to be quiet, Quinn's asleep. Okay, all right. Love you too! I gotta go! Okay. Bye. Love you too! Zane? Hello? People want to meet you. Okay. Let's do it. A little late isn't it, young lady? Sammy! Ah! How long have you been sitting in the dark like a maniac? You scared me to death. Bad night? Yeah... No... Maybe? I don't know. Let me guess. You met up with Dad and that stirred up a bunch of old feelings you didn't know you had and now you don't know how to feel? No. How'd you know? Because I'm psychic. We've spoken about my gift many times. And, dad called a half hour ago. Ugh, what do I do? Well, I get us a bottle of wine, and then we spend the night like cliche mother/daughter duos that we both can't stand. I'm in. I'll get the glasses. I'll get the wine. All right! Whoa! Let's see. Ah, look at my dumb face. What do you think? Zane! Zane! Sorry, it's not really my element, but, ah... Look who I found! Meagan? Again? I heard you were here. I couldn't pass up a good party! Of course not. Hey, could you get a photo of us? Yeah. Sure. Sure. - Got it. - One more. Okay. I really do have to go. It was great to see you again. - Thank you. You rock. - See you, buddy. Hey, ah, I hate to say this, but, I think he's in love with someone else. You want to meet the cast? Yeah, sure. Oh! Hey Jolene! Hey! When did you get back? Late last night. What are you up to? Oh. Just heading to the bakery. Of course. The wedding. So what kind did you go with? And did they give you a discount? Because I can talk to them. I'm actually just going to put a hold on the cake. Oh. It's nothing bad, it's just with the incredible fortune that Zane's had with his music lately, and me opening the store, we decided to pump the brakes a little. Well, I guess that makes sense. Although I know this is making Zane miserable. Are you all right? Aw... come here. I got you. I've barely talked to him, and I see him on TV surrounded by all these beautiful women. As long as I've known Zane, he's a good and honorable man. Now you know that. For sure I do. But what if he loves the attention more than he loves me, you know. Maybe I'm holding him back. You listen to me. Zane loves you and he wants to marry you as soon as this wedding can be arranged. You know what? You need cheesecake. Let's go get some. Mary, this is lower than low. Is that any way to greet an old friend? Well, I was actually being nice. Considering you put us through. If it wasn't for Jolene... How is Jolene? I've always liked her. Beautiful voice. Very professional. Unlike some people. Jolene is fabulous. Actually she works miracles because she found a way to get Zane out of that crappy little option you rigged in his contract. Did she? Yeah, she actually likes people. Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm going to cry. Mary, you need to stop messing with people's lives. Do you even know how many young artists have come to me because they're tired of big labels using and exploiting them? I thought you had the stomach for this industry. Apparently I was wrong. Yeah, well being tough can only take you so far, Mary. You are so naive. You know, when I find a young artist, I like to let them know that they're taken care of. But you show them no respect. You don't even give them the ability to develop their talents. Develop their talents! Do you hear yourself? That is a bunch of artsy-fartsy, touchy-feely nonsense! But that's not how it used to be. When I first started working with you, you wanted it to be nurturing the talent, show the singer how to find their voice, help the musician find their muse. - That was another time. - So what now? You want to break them? Just use them? You want to force a young couple to walk away from their wedding day? I am good at what I do because I make money. No. You used to be good at making music. It was always easier with you at my side. You're back on the Board again. They called me this morning. What are you going to do? I am going to nurture talented young artists into the biggest stars this world has ever seen. I look forward to working with you in the future. On one condition. What's that? You let me take you for tiramisu. No more autographs! That has to be twice as many as the last time right? Whew! At least. What? I'm torn. As your brother, I'm telling you you need to go home. See your family. And how are you torn? Because I know Billy's only giving you half the work that's coming in. This is your moment. Your star is rising. Even bigger than before. And you can't always see that as your professional star rises, you neglect your personal life. Jeannette. Quinn. Billy and I have seen other artists go through this. It tears people apart. Well, Jeannette and I don't plan to be like those other people, so... Nobody plans on ending up like other people. Well, what do you want me to do? Like you said, my star is rising. Right? Got to make hay while the sun is shining. But things have been so good lately at home with Jeannette and Quinn. I know. Believe me, I know you. I love you. You've got a serious offer on the table. How serious? Life changing. Billy says he's going to talk to you about it on Monday. I can't wait until Monday! What a tease! I can't wait until Monday! What a tease! What's the offer? What? The tabloids are breaking a story about you and Meagan. That you're together. What? Oh, you are looking cozy. Eew! Now that's a bit much. Oh come on! We're not together! I would never do anything with that woman. You know I would never cheat on Jeannette. I know. But the photos do not know. And they quote you "the engagement is off." Nobody ever asked me for a quote! They're being creative. As always. Look, I need to call Jeannette. I'm not releasing you for a few hours. I can get you home. Tough conversations are always better face-to-face. I wouldn't blame her if she wanted to throw that ring right back in my face. We're at Jolene's. As per your odd instructions. So, what are we doing here? Trying to make things right. Zane! Hey! There she is! There are so many photographers at the house. - Really? - Yeah. It was hard getting out of the driveway. Finally I had to tell them they were keeping a little girl from her best friend's birthday party. - And here we are! - Here we are. All right, Quinn. Come on. Let's go see if we can find Jolene. - Hey. - Hey. I thought if we met here we could avoid the photographers. Look, these tabloids, these photos... They're all made up. I never said the engagement was off. And this Meagan girl means absolutely nothing to me. You have to believe me. I love you, and only you. Of course I believe you. - You do? - Yes. I have to admit that seeing those photos hurt, but I could tell which ones were fake. I'm never going to believe a tabloid over you. So we're okay? You're not going to dump me? You know I want to spend the rest of my life with you, right? I want that too. But why didn't you just call and talk to me about it? I wanted to wait to talk to you in person. I figured I'd get back before the photos were released. In person's nice. I promise to always talk with you. Even when it's tough. I missed you so much. Oh no, not half as much as I missed you. Wait! Why are we at Jolene's house? You promised me a quiet night at home, just the three of us. True, but there's something else I promised you too. Come on. Let's go find Quinn first. What is this? Come on! Okay. All right. Come on! Come on! Pick up the pace! Pick up the pace! Surprise! - Really? - Uh huh. - Right now? - Yup. How did you do all this? Jolene. It was all Zane. I just added some elbow grease and called in a few favours. I like helping you. Which I greatly appreciate. Are you ready, Jeannette? Everything's good to go. Is this real? You better believe it. All righty then. Boys in the barn, girls come with me. Get over here, man. Let's do this! Thanks, big brother. Did you forget the rings? I thought you had them? Thank you. Sorry. One sec. Jolene's instructions. I didn't know you knew how to play? I don't. Mom. Zane. I hope you like your present. Happy wedding, Mom. Thank you. Thanks, sweetie. Ladies and gentlemen. Our faith has brought us here today to join two beautiful souls as one. Just looking around, I can see that this bride and groom is blessed with a bounty of friends and family to help support them and guide them through their union. Jeannette. Do you take Zane to be your lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health. To have and to hold. From this day forward? I do. And Zane. Do you take Jeannette to be your lawfully wedded wife. In sickness and in health. To have and to hold. From this day forward? Yes, but, wait. Quinn, Quinn, come here. All I've ever wanted was a family. And I can't think of a better way to start my family than to call you my daughter. And if it's all right with you, it would make me the proudest man in the world if you would let me be your father. I would love to be your family, Dad. Sorry for the interruption. I think all three of us are ready now. Then do you Zane, take Jeannette to be your lawfully wedded... I do! Absolutely. I do. Then I now pronounce you Husband and Wife. All right! Get over here! Come on! Get in here. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Mr. And Mrs. Zane and Jeannette Gunther. All right guys. Let's give them something nice and slow to dance to so Zane doesn't mess it up. Sammy, I don't know how your eyes are still in their sockets with all these cute single men in the room. Don't start. It's a nice night. Who's starting? Maybe you should just focus on your own man troubles. Oh please. I told you I'm too old for that silliness. Is that why that's the third time that you've looked over at Dad since he purposely stood in your eye line while watching the first dance? Want to come help me put my hands in the chocolate fountain? Um... Yes! Well, what do you think? Want to humour me? These shoes cost a fortune. So don't step on them. I think we both know I can't promise that. You look great. Thank you. You look good too. Good? Come on, we both know I look a whole lot better than good. If I agree will you promise to stop sucking in your gut? I thought I could hold out. This song is long. It's just hard. I can't just toss out everything that happened. Believe me. I know. The man I was ruined both of our lives. Believe me, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wake up and realize I ruined the best thing I ever had. Chris. Just take me back for a few dances. Because, if you can do that, I swear you'll give me enough to keep me going for the rest of my life. One two three four. Cheers. To a beautiful wedding. Cheers. That was so much fun! But I have a question. Little brother or little sister? I...
