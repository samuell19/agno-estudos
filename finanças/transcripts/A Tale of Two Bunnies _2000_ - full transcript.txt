This is the big time. - [Holly] Yeah. - [Ruby] Ah, look at the cars! - [Holly] Wow. - [Ruby] How about riding in style? - [Holly] That's something. - [Ruby] Wow. Look at that woman's hat. - Wow. - That's not a hat. That's a dead chicken. I would not be caught dead in that thing. Look at that one. That flare thing she's wearing makes her look like a pear. What kind of fur is that? Skunk? - The cute guy with her though. - Yeah, bet he's rich. Sure got off cheap with old Pepe Le Pew. Wow. Look at that turquoise dress. - [Holly] Jeez Louise. - This is so much better than the crud outside the Black Orchid last night. - It doesn't even compare. - Or two nights ago outside the Cloisters. Ugh, please. - Oh, that black dress. That's the one I want. - That's too plain. - I think it's classy. Oh. (grand music) (crowd applauding and cheering) - [Ruby] You've got a thing in your teeth. - Oh. (gasping) - Right there between the middle one and the other one. No, hold on, let me see. Mhmm, all right. Let's go. We gotta get up for work tomorrow. (sewing machines whirring) - Don't do it, Ruby. - You can't get ahead, Betty, if you don't even try. (door knocking) - Come in. - Mr. Cage? Sir. - Yes? - I was just thinking about our... I mean, your dresses. - Ah, it's good to know you girls are thinking about your job. - Sir, I was just wondering If I can- - Can't this wait until tomorrow? My wife has a roast on Wednesday. And she'll kill me if I'm a second late. - This will only take a second. (light kooky music) I was thinking that if we were to add a couple of darks down here by the waist like this, it would turn this drab Wednesday house dress into "Look out ladies, here I come!" I mean do you see how it would emphasize her, you know? - Today's housewife is looking for comfort. - It would still be comfortable. But she wants to look good too. - Why? - For the plumber. - Plumber? - And for herself while she's cleaning up around the house. - While she's vacuuming and doing the dishes and scrubbing the toilets? - Yes! I mean what better time to feel attractive than when you're doing things that make you feel so unattractive? Mr. Cage, if we can make a flattering dress with the same price as an unflattering dress, then we will sell more dresses- - What is she doing? - To more women who will feel better about wearing the dresses we make and we will feel better about making them! - How much time did this take? (somber piano music) - I just spent a little time today. - How many hours did you spend on this dress this afternoon? - Not much. - You didn't do any work today, did you? You're fired. Clean out your locker. - [Ruby] Bye. - [Man] All right, Jordan locks up the truck. - Well? Did he like it? - Not exactly. - What does he know anyway? Wait, Ruby, what's the big hurry? My God, you stole those! - Shh! They're just fabric samples. - Well what if you get caught? - I won't get caught. - Well if you do, you're gonna be fired. - I am fired. - You're fired? - Housecleaning, assembly line, laundromat, Playboy Bunny tryouts. - Shh. - Look at that outfit! Come way up in the leg like that? Makes her legs like 10 feet long, it's genius. - I wouldn't wear it. Look at the waist all squeezed in like that. - Come on, she looks like a million. (energetic music) ♪ My what a baby, ooh yeah ♪ - You would look great in it. - Who wouldn't? Okay, listen to this. ♪ Big bunny, oh yeah ♪ - You'll meet internationally famous people. - Hah! - Obviously you've never seen a Playboy Magazine. - It's not the same thing. This is a waitressing thing. - With almost no clothes on. - So what? (bus hissing) - Probably too flat-chested anyway. - (laughing) Oh my god. - Can you believe it? - That was so bad. - If I want men to ogle me, I can just stay at my own job, okay? End of conversation. - Okey-dokey. You know what I'm thinking about right now? Two front row center stage seats at Chez Paree. - Ruby! - What? I'm just thinking out loud. - Loud enough so I can hear you. - Fine. It's just that if we took this little job, I can maybe get enough money together to start my own business. So can you! - You're the one with the dream. I prefer to wear clothes to work. - You are such a prude. (audience laughing) - [Man] Why did the chicken cross the road? - [Man 2] How should I know? - You know, this would look so good on you. I'm doing it in your favorite color. Very chic. - [Man 2] Don't you belittle me, mister. - Don't you think she kind of looks like you? Man, you know what, I don't even know why I bother anyway if we can't afford to go anywhere. - Would you stop it, please? (TV audience laughing) - Yeah, well it's great doing business with you. At Hellman's, we aim to please. (laughing) - Hundred feet of piping, you get a free hot seat. Okay. Thank you, bye bye. - (laughing) After while, crocodile. Come on, come on in. The door is always open. - I was just on my way home, Mr. Hellman. - Such a polite thing. I keep telling you, call me Norm. - Well, I was just wondering. It's the first of the month, and- - And? - My parents, they count on me for help. They're having some financial- - Oh, say no more. I forgot a little something, didn't I? (chuckling) Come on, come on in. I don't bite. (chuckling) Ah, now where did I put that checkbook? It's here somewhere. Be a doll, look on the shelf over there, will you? I know it's around here somewhere. (light music) It's up here. - Sorry, I'm in your way. Here it is. - Oh. How silly is that? (chuckling) Good eyes. So, what do you say I take you out for a sandwich or something, hmm? - If you don't mind, I sort of have a bad headache. - Hey, Uncle Normie knows how to get rid of bad headaches. - Good night, Mr. Hellman. - (sighing) Ooh, ooh, ooh. - [Radio DJ] And you can core an apple with the same- - (growling) Come on, girl, come on, come on, come on. Keep going, keep going, good good good! (growling) - [Ad Man] The new 1961 Stop and Stitch electric zigzag sewing machine comes with a fashion disk, rocking wheel, button, and belt with attachments. You can even resole your shoes. Available now for the low low price of 29.95. - Rub it in, why don't you? - The new Stop and Stitch. Make sewing a snap. (static hissing) - Work, you stupid piece of crap! Ugh! Hey. - Hey. - Ugh, food, thank God! My stomach has been growling for hours. - I thought you said you were gonna clean this up? - I'm so tired. - Not too tired to sew. - Uh-oh, he did it again, didn't he? Holly, you gotta quit that job. - Right, then we'd both be unemployed. What are you doing? I thought we agreed. - Hmm? - One stick per person per day. - I'm hungry. - Give it back. - So I'll skip a day. - Don't push me, Ruby. Give it. - I'm getting licorice if I want. - Ruby! - Uh-uh. Uh, look at that. - Give it to me! - Don't pull it. Ah, ooh! (both grunting) Oh man. - Come on! - Look at this. - [Holly] You go ahead. (both grunting) (both laughing) (light music) - What are we doing? - I don't know. - We should take the job. Come on, Holly, what do you say? - Will we have to tell our folks? I can't believe we're doing this. - Just think about old Uncle Normie making your headache go away. - Okay, I'm walking, I'm walking. - Me, I am thinking about a ruby rare steak, blood running, and a baked potato with so much sour cream, it's like soup. - The Norm thing works better for me. I can't do this. - Go! Come on, let's make it happen. (light lounge music) (all chattering) - Oh, I think I'm gonna upchuck. - Come on. (ladies laughing) - [Waitress] All right, gentlemen, surf and turf and a steak? - [Man] Wow, and dope, it looks great. - [Man 2] Yeah, thank you dear. - [Hostess] Are you here to audition? - You could tell? We look that nervous? - Well, women are only allowed as guests of keyholders. - Oh, right. We knew that. - Across the room to the back, down the stairs and to your right. Relax, you're making me nervous. - Okay, Holly, shoulders back, chest up. God wouldn't give you that body if he wanted you to be ashamed of it. - You sound like a pimp! - Leave it to cleavage. - Ruby! - (sobbing) Oh. - What happened to her? - Loser. ♪ Bombobobombobombobombom ♪ ♪ Bobombobobom ♪ ♪ Dadangadangdang ♪ ♪ Blue moon ♪ ♪ You saw me standing alone ♪ (fingers snapping) - Let's go. - I heard they take your picture in a swimsuit. - In your swimsuit?

(women scoffing) I'm just kidding. - When will I know? - Like I said, we'll be in touch. - Reject. - Ruby! - [Interviewer] Okay, number 15? - [Woman] Ah, that's me. - Buh-bye. ♪ Bombobobombobombobombom ♪ Not everybody can get the job. ♪ Blue moon ♪ - So what is your name and where are you from? - Well my name is Denise Smith. - I'm Nancy Miller. - I just go by Ruby. - Tennessee originally, by way of Kentucky. - Columbus, Ohio. I was Miss Jamboree. - I'm from Independence. That's in Missouri. It's the Show Me State. - Mostly ride on floats and wave to the folks. - I won the blue ribbon for sheep shearing. - Harry S. Truman was born in Independence. We're independently minded. - One time I fell on the float and my crown fell off. And this man Jimmy's tractor ran it over. - My parents would die if they knew I was even considering this. - Oh. Well, I have a lot of experience in the design industry. In fact, I was thinking, I don't know, update the bunny costumes. So many ideas. Bold, abstract prints? Leopard print bunnies. Can't you just see that? I was born for this job, when it comes to ideas. If maybe you ever wanted help, you know, fashion-wise, I could take you shopping. I could. I would be willing to do that and you know, maybe take you to get a new do. I mean, the only reason I ask. I like your hair, really. It's very vibrant. Not that I don't like it, but it looks... Ladies about your age... I mean you must have to have that processed all the time. So, where do I sign up? - Holly Tanner. - Holly. You don't hear that name much. - I was born at Christmas. - Oh, that's sweet. It's okay. I won't bite. Well, you're certainly pretty enough. - Well, thanks. - What's the matter? People don't tell you that often? - No. - Do you always wear so little makeup? - Oh. - I'm just curious. It's okay. So you're new to town, huh? Near the top of your class. No college? - Well my folks couldn't afford to send us both and my sister, she's really smart so I wanted her to go. - So why do you think you want to be a bunny? - The truth? - Hmm. - I think genetically, I have a really nicely shaped head for bunny ears. - I had a bunny once when I was a little girl. His name was Bobo. Jimmy's tractor ran that over too. - Oh. - For the money? - Nothing wrong with that. It's better to be honest. Do you have any waitress experience? - Ruby and I, she's the one you just met. - Oh yeah. - We worked at the Dairylicious. Well, that's about it. - Well I think we should take this to the next step. How would you feel about our taking some photographs of you? - Oh, I didn't bring my own suit. - Oh, that's okay. We'd like to see you in the real thing. - Really? - Is that a problem? - Well no, it's just that, Ruby, she really wants to work here and if you were to say, hire me and not her? - I'm sorry, but you're the one who's bunny material. - I can't take this job if Ruby doesn't. She's really smart and talented, and... Oh and she's so strong. You should see her play softball. Not that that's what we do here, but, if you had things, like those trays, they look really heavy. Ruby, she could carry those, no problem. Just- - Does she stick up for you as much as you stick up for her? - Ruby would do anything for me. For anybody. People really like her. (upbeat music) - Right this way. Oh, Judy. A little bit more. Amanda, brighter lipstick. - Mmm, you like that bleu cheese, don't you, Kelsey? (snorting) Come on, Michelle, you're up. - Thelma, I've got two auditions here! - Hold your horses, Seabiscuit! Who else is gonna weigh these porkers? - It's like backstage at the Rockettes! This is the big time. - It sure is. - All right, girls, over here. All right. You try this one. And you- - I know, black is really my color, in bathing suits and bunny outfits. - You have to graduate to black. Black is for top bunnies only. All right, here. This one'll fit you. - Hey, hey, hey. What are you, decorating a Christmas tree? Leave the bunny design to the expert. - I thought red for Ruby, that's her name. - Oh, red for Ruby, isn't that sweet? Green. Red would be a cliche. - Green's fine. I wouldn't wanna step on your toes, Thelma. - Watch it, bean pole. - Is pink okay? - Yeah, sure, I'm easy. Stick with me, honey. I'll make you look like a million bucks. Hey. Rabbits for breakfast, lunch and dinner. No wonder I'm just a hop, skip and jump away from the looney bin. Here. Hey, Goldilocks! Wait a minute, wait a minute. You're a mess! - You can change over there. - Is there a curtain or something? - You better get used to it. (gasping) Natalie. Your ears are crooked. - I can't do this. - What about me? I stuffed my brassiere! - Girls, get a move on. - All right ladies, listen up. Baby bunnies on the floor, so remember, no peeking. Now, girls, you won't have to worry about being naked in front of total strangers anymore, because after today, we won't be total strangers. (upbeat jazz music) - Okay. Wait a minute, wait a minute. (Ruby exclaiming) (Holly gasping) - You know, the last girl I corseted up, two broken ribs and a punctured lung. - Oh, gosh. - I'm kidding. Only one cracked rib. Hairline thin, nothing to worry about. - It's a little hard to breathe at first but you get used to it. All right, turn around. Let's see. Hmm. (Thelma gasping) - Oh my god, we gotta give this girl some bazooms. Here. Barbie socks, they're clean, stuff. Go on. You ever see Jane Mansfield? - Yeah. - Well, her you're not and you never will be. Go on, down the sides and on the bottom. In and up, in and up. Come on, come on! - Just let them lay on top. That'll do the job nicely. - Go on, stuff. Go on, girly. Ah, check, two torpedoes in the hole. Who said the army cornered the market on rockets, huh? Doris! What's with the droopy drawers? (jazzy music) - Oh! Damn, we look good. Woo! (giggling) Go on, Holly, give it a little shake. - No. - Come on, please? Spin around or something. You look great, you really do. (grand orchestral music) Like a million bucks.

Thank you. - Merits cancel out demerits at the rate of one merit for every one demerit. - Steak sauce, hi. It is a steak, you know? - Chewing gum in front of a customer, 10 demerits. - A bunny must present herself in the most pleasing and professional manner possible. Chives, I need chives so bad.

Riots broke out early this morning in response to the latest freedom riot into Birmingham. Several negro residents were severely beaten. Attempts to force the desegregation of a state that is so far refusing to grant negroes equality has led to repeated bouts of violence and bloodshed. (radio clacking) - Prayers for your family, honey. - Georgia, Ruby, Holly. Oh, hell, any of you that don't have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving, you're all welcome to come to my house. Ray and I are making a turkey. - Aw! - Except you, fella. - Well, that's okay by me because I got a date. - Woo! (girls cheering) - He's loaded and I ain't bringing him around you vultures.

I'm tired of this whole job you've got. - Ruby, maybe you should eat something. - Oh, I'm just not very hungry tonight. - I can't make this kind of money doing anything else, what do you want me to do? - You might as well just be a prostitute. I mean what am I supposed to tell people? What am I supposed to tell my friends at school? My wife is working as a Playboy bunny? Ridiculous! - [Evie] Then you go put yourself through school! - [Ray] Fine, maybe I will! - Get out! I quit college and bust my butt to pay his tuition and he has the nerve to be jealous?

One day he discovers there's a million dollars missing from the bank account. So he hires an interpreter and he wants to grill the guy. He says "Ask him how much money's in the bank account." The interpreter goes "How much money is in the bank account?" The guy goes, "It's all there, there's two million dollars." And so the mob guy goes "Look, tell him there's a million dollars missing and I wanna know where it is." He goes, "There's a million dollars missing. I wanna know where it is." And the mute goes "I don't know what you're talking about. It's all there." The mob guy takes out a gun and says "Listen you, I'm gonna blow your head off if you don't tell me where the money is!" (drum hitting) The interpreter goes, "Listen you." You know, he had the accent too. He goes, "Listen you. I'm gonna blow your head off if you don't tell me where the money is!" The mute guy's freaking out, his arms are a million a mile minute. He goes "It's under my bed, it's under my bed, it's under my bed!" And the interpreter looks at the mob guy, he says, "He says he thinks you're bluffing." (audience laughing) True story, true story. (audience applauding) - Gin and tonic. Scotch and soda.

My Bears are playing the Vikings. They're from Minnesota. You know where that is, right? - Yes I know where Minnesota is. - See, I love this. It's gonna be very easy. Now, the Vikings have this new quarterback, Fran Tarkington, who we, me and you, hate. He made four touchdown passes in his very first game. But the Bears have some new guys too. They have this tight end Mike Ditka. He's becoming an instant star, he's got a very good sense of strategy. I think one day he'll coach. Don't worry, this is just the background info. You ready? - Yeah. - All right. (parade music) Ditka on the cross. He's got it! No, Ditka's that guy. No, he's that guy! He's completely confusing the opposition! HE's completely confusing me. But whatever it is, it's working because he's on the 10, he's on the five. He's back on the 20, that's okay. He's moving forward. He's one on one, one man to beat. 10, five, touchdown Ditka! The man cannot be stopped. The audience is going crazy, all 82,342 on their feet screaming! (imitating crowd cheering) (light romantic music) I've always wanted to be an announcer. - You'd be great.
