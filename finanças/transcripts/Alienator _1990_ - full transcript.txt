You ready for your big day, scum? Vaporization is too good for you. I'd a lot rather see you kicking at the end of a rope, or squirming and crawling around dying real slow in a gas chamber. As a matter of fact, after that ugly stunt you pulled on Alpha Seven... I'd give anything to kill you myself. It's a lousy shame half of our families had to be present for that. Commander. Your visitor is in security. Visitor? A delegate general from Gamma 12. He's not due until tomorrow. Well, there's been an official change. - Problems? - Don't ever talk to me, scum. What the hell is going on here? How come I wasn't notified? Commander, I'm sorry I meant to tell you. It's... just I got -distracted with-- - It was a direct order, sir, priority blue. Uh, the delegate general had a scheduling conflict. He's here only to observe. When I want your interpretation, Tara, I'll ask for it. I'm sorry, Commander. I only meant-- And Tara, have your boyfriend let you get some sleep, you're looking a little... burnt. No executions for six months. Today of all days, I've got public relations to deal with. How is his genes scan? Checks out, A-Okay. Wow. Look at that hook pattern. Never saw that before. He's from Gamma 12. They had a mass gene splicing there a couple hundred years ago, could be residual effect. My name is Lund. I'm here to observe and make a few suggestions so... just carry on and forget I exist. - Prepare the first execution. - That'll be prisoner 485. Do it. And bring in Kol, put him in the holding cell. I want him to see what's in store for him. What are those green buttons there? Uh, well this one regulates the vapor quantifier and this one engages the destruct mechanism, provided the safety is off. Mm. So you hold the power of life or death in those pretty little hands. I don't get any particular thrill -in pulling the switch. - No? Then why don't you try not pulling the switch? Make a stand for the sanctity of human life, -make a difference, be daring. - Then I wouldn't have a job, and besides, it's not up to me. She's right, Lund. This is the last stop. Prisoners here have exhausted all their appeals. They've had their day in court. This is the toilet of the interplanetary penal system. Our job is just to flush 'em. First prisoner is approaching the chamber now. Here are the files on the first two, Commander. Let him have a look. See what kind of scum we're about to neutralize. - Prisoner 485 in position. - All clear. You realize this prisoner leaves children behind? What you're doing here is inhuman. He's inhuman. His kind should've never been allowed to breed. On my planet, even the most vicious criminals are allowed life. We believe in dynamic rehabilitation. Executions such as these are barbaric. That's right. Erase him. What is it? You got the all clear! I don't know. I've checked all the circuits, I... - Safety's engaged. - Get up, I'll do it. Very hard on her. We have a serious mandate here. There's no room for sloppiness. All clear. Take a good look, Kol. This is how we're gonna turn you inside out. Hey, Kol. I'm keeping this seat warm for you. Looks like electrical damage. There's no response from the guards. It's a break. Secure all areas. You guys follow me. I'm gonna do this guy the big favor myself. Secure all areas. Alert! Alert! Secure all areas. Alert! Alert! Secure all areas. Alert! Alert! Hurry, cut him off on level five. - Level five sealed. - More activity on three C. - This Triple-O-C Kol? - You know him? Only from his file, interesting man. He's a scum. Someone's broken into the airlock. He gets out of the station, we've lost him. - He's gone. - I don't believe - I let him get away. -It's not you're doing though. If my staff malfunctions, I'm to blame. - I'm not done yet though. - Meaning? - Call out the hunter unit. - Alright. Earth, Earth. Don't you think you've had enough to drink, Rick? I drive better on a couple of brews. Hey, Rick, how much further we've got to go? Half hour I guess, maybe more. We'd be there by now if it wasn't for this damn road. Do you want me to drive for a while? - I'll yell if I need you. - Okay. Oh, Rick, look what I did! You made me smear my lipstick. How can you tell? What was that? I don't know. It must've been a meteor. Hey, why don't we stop and take a little rest, stretch our legs, and maybe we can find something. I don't stop till I get where I'm going, jeez. Rick slow down please. You have been in my Porsche on the Ortega Highway, come on. Porsche, and this isn't the Ortega Highway. Come one, trust me. I know what I'm doing. - Slow down please. - Shit. Oh God! - You've hit someone. - Tell me about it. - What happened? - Damn. - Rick hit someone. - Oh, great driving, Mario. - Damn! - Come on. Oh, my God. Is he dead? Oh, Jesus, Karen, what are you trying to do, finish him off? What's this shit all over his face? Is he a wine-o or something? Well, it certainly be fortunate for us if he was. We gotta get help for him. Listen, it wasn't my fault. He just like... bolted out -in front of me. - Rick, calm down, okay? My dad's a lawyer. I'm sure he'll help you out. - I don't need a lawyer. - Rick-- - This weirdo-- - Nobody's blaming you. Now come on, let's get him inside. Look, where are we going to take him? There's a ranger station near the camp grounds. I don't hear his heart. Damn! Jesus. I'm sorry, Harley. I... I guess I'm just a bit jumpy. Well, we'll put that on the list along with stupid! Hey, what the hell are you doing now, Burt? Cans, for target practice, Harley. You know we don't have time for this kind of shit. - Put the god damn cans down. - Oh, come on, Harley. Look, now you are hungry, and what's more, I'm hungry so get up off your ass and let's find something so we can both eat. - Okay? - Okay, Harley, okay. Now go on and get your ass down the path. - God damn, Harley, you got it. - Oh, be quiet, will you? You'll get the warden on our ass. - Look at it. - You got that right. Put the trap down. Don't ever mess with another man's trap, Burt. Well, how are you doing, Ward? We just heard the poor whimpering cries of this little thing and being the good Samaritans we are, we decided to... well, you know, -come to its rescue. - Is that what happened, Burt? Well, you know how it is, Ward. How many times am I gonna have to write you two up? One more citation and you're both going to the work farm. Oh... Ward, you wouldn't wanna do that, would you? Look, I know you fellows gotta eat, but stealing my traps and these animals is against the law, state law and my law. You know, how come it is that you get to get all the animals you want and we can't, you know, I don't... that just don't seem -fair at all to me. - Harley, you know this section of the forest is a game preserve, that means no hunting. Now, I catch 'em, I tag 'em and let 'em go. You stick to your part of the forest, you can trap all the rabbits you want. But you just stay out of my neighborhood. But all the good animals come over here. - That's right. - They just look at our traps and come over to your neck of the woods. I've seen your traps. Since when does it take a bear trap to catch a rabbit? Oh now, wait a minute, Ward. You don't know what might show up around here. You know, we've been here a lot longer before you ever dropped in here and I wanna tell you something, there was bears here, and cougars and maybe even - a big foot or two. - You all just turn around and get yourselves right on outta here. Go on, -pick up your stuff and get. - Now alright. Okay, little fella, we'll take care of you. Come on, it should be right down there. This guy's got a first aid kit? Come on. Maybe there's a doctor here. - No, don't say anything. - Calm down, calm down, -one at a time. - This guy just jumped out in front of me. I clipped him. He's hurt bad. - Where is he? - He's in the RV. - We better have a look. - He jumped out in front of me. Nobody could've stopped in time, nobody, -and I've got witnesses. - Just take it easy, young man. How long ago did this happen? - Fifteen, 20 minutes. - He's weird looking, isn't he? I mean... I mean he's some kind of wacko. Yeah. Help me get him into the cabin. Here, put this on his head wound for now. - Hey, you calling the police? - I am the police around here. - Yeah. - Hello, Doc Burnside. Doc this is Ward Armstrong up here at station one. Ward, it's a little late to be calling, huh? Well I-- I'm sorry to bother you, Doc, but... we've got a badly injured fella up here, got himself tangled up with an RV. - Uh, how serious is it? - Well, he's... breathing shallow, he's lost a lot of blood or bodily fluids or something. What, what are you talking about? Uh... nothing, uh... How long will it take you to get up here? Probably... half an hour or so. Listen, you... you just keep him warm and comfortable and keep his legs elevated until I get there, hmm? - Okay, Doc, thanks. - Alright. So what's the story? Can... can we go now? Just take it easy. I need to file a report on this, I'll need to run your license with the LAPD computer. Look, I'm no criminal, I'm a pre-law student and I know my rights. Like I said if you check out and there's no outstanding warrants, you'll be outta here in an hour. No problem. - Is this decaf? - Nope. Oh, thank you, God. I need a serious caffeine fix. - Anybody else? - I'll take a cup, please. Death spasm. Saw it once in a movie. All the muscles kind of contract and bang. They sit up -on the morgue table. - Shut up, Benny. I can't feel any pulse. I bet the bastard doesn't even have insurance. He's not gonna need it now. Look at those eyes. It looks like he's whacked out on PCP. You've been in an accident. Do you have any family? Any friends? Someone you want us to contact? - It's coming. - What's coming? Death! - What is your name? - Kol. Kol? How do you spell that? And what kind of accent is that? Are you French? Isn't that interesting? When he speaks, it... it looks kind of like a kung fu movie. I... come from another world. I was... captured by... beings. They were going to torture and kill me. I had no choice. I... fled their planet and landed here. Who's "they"? They will track me down and kill me... kill you, all of you. According to this, the pursuit craft has landed. Coordinates? Very close to the crashed shuttle. If the prisoner's still alive, the hunter unit will find him. He's still alive. His kind always survives. - Better tell the Commander. - Just do your job. I don't understand it, I released the safety, - I know I did. - You thought you did. I did. You were probably day dreaming. I wasn't. I may not be the most objective person. I don't think it was too objective of you when you dumped me for that E.M. Please don't. It's your career you're throwing away. You can't order me to love you, Commander. I can't? Well, a curious way to keep the troops on toe, Commander. Well, don't stop on my account. Looks like fun. Go to your quarters. Rather highly decorated for a degenerate. You've got a lot of balls even for a delegate general. Heard of the primitive custom here? It's called "knock first". Well... Another one of your toys? As a matter of fact, it is. It's a test for strength and skill. - Perhaps you'd like to play. - Perhaps I would. Come in. That's an example of a proper way of doing it. Excuse me, Commander, the recovery ship has landed, mobile unit's taking a pursuit on land. Is the tracking device still intact? So far, the prisoner has been unable to remove it. As long as that collar remains functional, the unit should've no trouble in finding him, eliminating him. And if the unit meets with life forms, what then? I don't care if it blows a whole planet apart. I want that prisoner dead at any cost. Forget to pay your utility bill? I think the generator is blown. It's here. It's taken control of your power systems. - This guy is a nutcase. - Please, Rick, he's trying - to tell us something. - Where are you from? My home... no longer exists. They destroyed it. What a crock! This bozo's not from outer space. He's just some nutcase from a loony bin. Maybe he's telling the truth. Maybe he really is from another world. Now you're just talking as Orrie as the brainiac here. Oh, shit. What the hell. Look I... I'm the... the doctor, they sent for me. It's here. Phone's dead. It's here now. That's why your machines will not work. What are you talking about, buddy? It'll kill me. Anyone who stands in its way will be destroyed. Blow it outta your ass, goof ball. What the hell is going on here? I'll go outside and see if I can get the generator working. I'm going with you. So, Kol... Do you, uh, know ET? - What's the problem? - Ah, not the Orrie, it's getting gas. Damn thing is busted. - Let me try. - I said it's busted, son. Nothing. Damn. - What the fuck's going on here? - Damned if I know. What the hell did you do with the truck, Burt? You saw me start it. I didn't do shit. Damn thing just died. Oh, how old was that battery anyhow? Brand new. I just stole the damn thing yesterday. - What the hell? - Well, screw this walking crap. Thank you, thank you. - You ain't gonna steal a car? - Oh, we ain't stealing it, it's probably abandoned. Let's just hope they abandoned the key too. Hey, I don't know if I wanna steal a car. Well then you can just walk. My feet hurt so adios, amigo. This looks like Doc Burnside's car. You know, -he wouldn't mind if we used it. - Harley, Harley. Yeah, just a minute, just a minute. Harley... what is that? Oh, my God. You don't think it's Doc Burnside, do you? He don't look to well. Huh, well done is more like it. Don't touch it. Don't do that. Come on, the keys ain't in the car. Let's go. - You want some drugs, Burt? - Not if they are the kind -he's been taking. - Oh God! In my opinion, he's a real McCoy, a genuine visitor from another planet. Think about it. We are taking part in man's greatest historical encounter here. We'll go down in the history books. Outstanding, really outstanding. Now let's just say this goof us here is who he claims to be, some refugee from planet X being chased half way across the universe by some cosmic killer? You must be some bad dude. Hey. You a bad dude? What did you do to get your ass in such a sling? You don't look so bad down the barrel of this gun. Hey why did you do that? Didn't anybody ever teach you not to play with firearms? Yeah, you're gonna need all the help you can get -when that monster gets here. - Monster? Take it easy, there isn't any monster. Oh, yeah, right, like it's just coincidence the power's out, that the phone won't work, that the cars won't start, -who are you kidding? - This is a very advanced being. He probably sucks electricity up like a sponge. Maybe he can suck the electrons of our thoughts -right out of our brains. - Knock it off, jerk. What are you worried about? Your brain's already drained. His race probably thinks of us the same way we do of white lab rats. You know, as something to pump full of cigarettes -and diet soda. - Hey, that's enough, Benny. Oh, come on, I was just theorizing. It's here. It's outside. Stay inside here, all of you. Wait, I wanna go with you. I thought I told you to stay inside. Awesome. What do you want? I'm not staying trapped in here with this guy? It might be dangerous outside. Make a move and you're history. What the hell... You really are from-- Back off, fucker. Kill it. It's your only chance. It doesn't look like a monster to me. Don't go any nearer. Let me try to talk to it. You see that weapon it carries? It can easily incinerate this building. You will burn slowly from the inside out. - No way. - I'm telling you the truth. I don't want to die. Do you? - But... - Oh, don't be afraid. You can do it. Use your weapon now before it's too late. - What the... Stop shooting. - I got it. Stop shooting. Go back to the cabin. I think we should go with him. - What the hell are you doing? - Great fucking shooting... She was gonna blast you guys! Save it, we are going out the back. Jesus Christ, what the hell is happening? Keep moving, keep moving, hurry up, keep moving, come on, come on. Run! - Which fucking way? - Straight ahead, -there's another cabin up there. - We almost got our asses dusted trying to hide in that cabin. That space bitch just got something against wood. Get the picture? She wants to kill us because you had to play Rambo, -you muscle head. - Kill each other now, it'll be easier for you all and far less painful. Come on, let's move, move. Well, what do you see? Well, it looks like Ward's cabin alright. What the hell is he doing? Well, he ain't doing nothing. Looks like he left his lights on. What was that? I don't know. You better come on down here. - Is that what we are hunting? - More likely what's hunting us. What'd we do to it? What did the little old rabbit ever do to us? Well, one bit me once. Point that thing in another direction, you ignorant hillbilly. I swear to God if you weren't my brother, I'd put you out -of my misery. - Oh, now you wouldn't do that, would you, Harley? No, I promised mama I'd take care of you. - There's a shortcut over here. - Wait, stay on the path. - Rick! No. - Wait here. I'll go after him. I warned you to stay on the main trail. What asshole put that there? Poachers have traps all over this area. Well, that goddamn thing could've torn my leg off. Did anybody ever tell you that you've got an attitude problem? All the time. They're coming. Rick are you alright? - Yeah. - Those chunks of metal won't stop it. I think we should stick this sack of shit to the ground -and let her have 'em. - Old Rick's got himself -a good point, right, huh? - Alright. You all follow along that trail until you come to a tree marked with a "no hunting" sign. I'll meet you there. Where are you going? Nowhere yet. I'm gonna stay here and see that whatever that is takes advantage of this trap. Oh, a hero at work, I love it. Job's open if you want it. - No thanks, you can have it. - Okay then, get moving. - Be careful, Ward. - Don't worry, she'll see just enough of me to put her right where we want her. Oh, my God. Would you look at this guy, he can barely walk, if we don't get rid of him, we're never gonna get out of here. I wanna go home. Caroline, we all wanna go home. Home, you'll have no home, if it and their kind invade. Wait a minute, you're... you're saying we could be invaded here? Not if we kill it and the others will not follow. - You could save your planet. - You mean it's up to us? Yes, yes. Come on, right behind me. Damn it, what in the hell you boys doing out here? Oh, well, our damn truck broke down, and we was hoof in' it home. Son a bitch. Then we ran across Doc Burnside. Burnside? Is he alright? - Well, not exactly, no. - How's your foot, Burt? Well, to be perfectly truthful, it could be better. - Do you think you can walk? - The question is can you run? - Well, help me up. - Here, have your rifle. I mean, what in the hell is going on around here, Ward? Look, there's no time to talk about that right now. All you got to worry about is getting your butts back to your place and getting yourself barricaded in. - Barricaded? - From what? Look, you just listen to what I'm telling you, you're gonna be alright. Whatever in the hell that is out there, it's not after you, boys. Well, look, I don't like running away from something that I don't even know what it was. I mean Doc Burnside's laying back there like a smoked ham. I don't care, I ain't afraid of it-- Harley, look. Let's get the hell outta here. The shit has hit the fan, let's roll. No. Go. Ward said to wait here. Listen, I said we're going. Your lover boy is burnt toast by now. We've got to stick together. The fate of the entire world might depend on our keeping our heads. What are you, nuts? - I don't wanna stay here either. - I'm waiting for Ward. - Oh, so that's the way it is? - Yes, that's the way it is. And while I'm waiting, I'm going to add a little insurance to the landscape. These Orrie sticks may slow it down. Come on, let's move out. We set trap of Orrie sticks for her. May be that will slow her down. What? No trophy? I thought you'll at least bring back her head. No trophy, Rick. - And she's not dead. - Not even close. Let's go. Hold it, the cabin is just ahead. - Yeah, then what? - Look that... thing back there isn't going anywhere with Orrie sticks in its legs. - Who the hell is it? - It's Ward Armstrong. - What's up, Ward? - We've got big trouble, Colonel. - It will take some explaining. - Come in and tell me about it, you have to do your talking by candlelight, the power's out. - I got a few people with me. - So I noticed, bring 'em on in. - Okay, everybody, inside. - Where did the kids come from? - Let's talk about it inside. - This should be interesting. You've got some strange looking friends, Ward. Here you go, pass one around. So you're from... didn't get the name of your planet, son. A penal colony, it had no name. Alright, a prison planet, no name, not even a number. At least we give prisoners numbers down here. Colonel, I know this sounds strange, but we don't have time to discuss this right now. That thing out there is gonna be coming through your front door the hard way any minute now. Uh, this... female... alien, you say, she's packing some kind of a laser weapon? Yeah, she blew the shit outta Mr. Game Warden's cabin. The Ruskies have an operational laser. Let the Vietnamese use it in the border incident with the Chinese as I recall. Hey, look, Colonel, I know this is hard to swallow, I can hardly believe it myself, but hot damn it's the truth. You believe it's the truth, but it's common knowledge that UFOs, little green men and space monsters are figments of the imagination, usually brought on by stress. Fucking A we got stress, we're stressed out to the max here. - We'll get our brains blown out! - Your skating on thin ice, boy. Let's stop playing macho for a minute. The reality is there is someone or something out there trying to kill us. What it is or where it's from doesn't really matter, does it? This ought to make everyone feel more comfortable. I'm telling you we shot her over and over again, she just kept coming. This is an AK-47. I took it off an NVA officer after he'd sliced up an entire squad, my squad. AK will do one hell of a job with the right man behind the trigger. But, Colonel, she bleeds yellow ooze. Hell, just as long as she bleeds. It's a Weatherby Magnum. It'll drop a bull elephant at 100 yards. It's coming. He says that collar is some kind of tracking device, -says it won't come off. - It won't, huh? No, Colonel, don't. Close but no cigar. Had that thing on a long time? Well, let's put it where it can do some good. But first we need to put a little bite in the bait. You, grab a gun and guard the back door. Illegal as hell, but I wouldn't be home without it. Anti-personnel mine. Nothing on this planet or any other planet is gonna walk away when this baby blows. We were thinking, Colonel, there might be another way. - Like what? - Tell him, Kol. It's possible to interrupt its energy systems. You got an idea? Let's hear it. A net. - A net? - A net made out of some form of metal, when placed in contact with it, it can short-circuit, maybe even destroy it. Hell, give it a try. I got some barb wire and chicken mesh in the shed. But my money is on this baby. Commander, a word with you? Game's over. You win. The hunter unit is continuing to engage the native life of the planet, but you know how devastating the power is, in its effort to regain the prisoner it's methodically destroying -everything in its sight. - Well, the chase is escalating? Why is this taking so damn long? Well, maybe the prisoner is meant to live. Alright, let's go. If she's still homing in on that collar, she'll walk into the biggest surprise of her life. Yeah, maybe. I got that. Give me that thing. Everybody down. - We're in fort now. - See, Colonel, it's the war of the worlds, and we're on the front line. Stay calm, son. I know we're all gonna die. We're gonna get of this, Caroline, I know we are. No, we're not. She'll catch us in this dirt hole, and she's gonna kill all of us. Listen, if you're quiet, she might not know where we are. Ward, there she is. Some figment of the imagination, Colonel? I'd like to get a closer look at that. Come on, come on. - What the hell? - Why didn't it go off? Must be a goddamn dud. Listen. - What's that gibberish? - She's trying to communicate. Don't listen to any of her shit. Blast her. Shut up. It's starting to sound like English. - It's very clear what it says. - Well, spit it out. I will let you go. Come out, come out. It orders you to lay down your weapons and surrender. It will let you go free, if you turn me over to it. - Sounds reasonable to me. - Kol, please, for our sake would you goddamn give yourself up? First rule, never surrender your weapons. Second rule, blow the hell outta your enemy before they can do it to you. Huh! Got her. Oh yeah, I've heard that before. Let us scrape her up with a spoon. Alright, back to your post and keep your eyes open. - What's your problem, geek? - I can help you escape. - Yeah, I don't need your help. - We need each other. Oh yeah, why is that? The others will wait until it's too late. It will attack soon. Hey, she's blown to shit. Do you really believe that? It's out there now. Listen, if you know so much, why do you need me? I need someone to teach me the ways of your world. I can make you the richest man on this planet. Rich, huh? VG TY- Nah, I don't think so, bug face. You are a walking target and I don't want you anywhere near me. When I leave, I leave on my own. So get out of my air space, you're crowding me. Go on, scram. Get the fuck outta here. You know, when I was a little kid... I always wanted to meet an alien. I did. I used to have a membership to the science fiction book club. And I can remember I read... Edgar Rice Burroughs and John Carter of Mars series, you know... and I'd sneak out after dinner sometimes of my bedroom window, you know, and lay outside in the backyard looking up at the stars... and I would think to myself how neat it would be to be John Carter of Mars, riding across the plains on those big lizard things, I'd have my BB gun, wave my BB gun around. John Carter always had a... faithful assistant, somebody who was level-headed like you and... he was always... he was always going to rescue some really beautiful girl, like you. You know, I... never dreamed it would be like this. She's on the fucking roof. She's on the fucking roof. Get away, you fucking bitch. Why don't you kill us right now? Shh, shh, shh, shh... Don't move, It's on the roof. It can't be, nothing could've lived through that blast. Don't fire that, muzzle blast might torch the roof. - You got shit for brains, kid? - Oh, my God, get out of here. Caroline! Caroline! Stay put, now I'm pissed. - See anything? - Nothing. Where'd she go? Oh, oh, guys, don't shoot, don't shoot. She's out in the front, she's got Rick. I'll go around the back. Yeah! Yes, yes! Look, Colonel, the net's created a perpendicular magnetic pole. It's siphoning off her electrons in alignment with the Earth's axis. It's over. Yeah, until her friends come looking for her. Maybe we should cremate the body just to be sure. Burn up the only proof we have? - I don't know about that. - Maybe you're right. Oh, I wish I'd had one of these babies back on Pork Chop Hill. I'd have fried me some Commie Rice. Well, let's get her outta here anyway. Yeah, we can put her in my truck. You should be compensated for all your trouble and pain. Fuck off, pal. Wow, how'd you do that? I can teach you that and more, much more. - What's your angle, man? - A simple exchange of skills. I need to adapt to your planet. We can be each other's teacher. I don't run a nursery school for space geeks, pal. Go talk to NASA about that. They'd love to squeeze you under a microscope. Exactly what I wanted to avoid. Come with me. I hope she don't bleed all over my damn truck. Do you think it's alright to leave her here? She's not going anywhere. I got the keys. - Well, let's go. - Rest in peace... soldier. Stop. So now what? Time to die... a little. What's that supposed to mean? I thought I was gonna teach you the ways of the planet. You will. Cut the crap, what do you really want? You. - Here you go, Ward. - Thanks, honey. I wonder where Rick and Kol went to. Good question. Maybe we better go and have a look, warden. - Finished with the coffee? - I guess so. Where have you been? Can't a guy take a leak in private. - Where's Kol? - How the hell should I know? Oh, wait a minute. I don't like being touched, man. Something's wrong here. Excuse me, sir, this is a restricted area, you're not allowed to be here. I'm sorry, I guess I lost my way. I... Well, the master control room is right through that door. Thank you very much. Oh, the sun's come up. It's about time, it was the longest night of my life. All our lives. Orrie, go get me another beer. I think you've had enough to drink for six in the morning, Rick. I wanted to drink a toast to Caroline... to Caroline's expert marksmanship, mighty fine shooting, little lady. I can't argue with that. And to Ward and the Colonel for saving our lives. - Hear, hear! - Thank you. I'm worried about Kol. I mean, I wonder where he is. He's out getting worms for breakfast, who cares? I'll go get some gas for the generator. - Do you need some help? - No, thanks. I'll handle it. Rick, lay off. What I had in mind, a little lay. I said leave me alone Rick, I mean it. Let go. - I said leave me alone. - You know what I had in mind. Let me go. Back off, kid. Rick! Get inside. - Rick, what's wrong with you? - I've appropriated Rick's body. He's a small grease spot in the forest. I'm Kol. You are nothing. What the hell is going on? Preparing final termination sequence. Now let's do a positive ID gene scan just for the record. Don't want our delegate general friend saying we're not following our own code. It's Kol alright, his head anyway. - That's strange. - What? Well, his gene pattern, it has that same hook just like... Identification positive. War criminal Kol terminated. Mission completed. Kol, no, no, no, Kol. Kol, no! Permission requested to return to planet. Hey, what did Kol do that you traveled so far to kill him. It was my directive. Disintegrate him, repeat, disintegrate him. I want that man ashes. Residue removed. Hold it. That's it? You... you're just leaving? After all this, you're just walking outta here? What did she give you? You have more than a passing interest in our prisoner. Yes, I do. Again you've shown your strength... but you are not gonna win this game. Now that you've shown your true colors, who are you? I come from the Steloid Arcatron. For millennia, we were ruled over by the tyrants of Quadrant Five. Finally, when our day came, we ambushed the enemy on Alpha Seven. Along with thousands of innocent students from our sector. I couldn't be responsible for those who got in our way. Your people were murderers we exiled for a good cause. - What do you want? - I came to stop this execution. I fooled your computers, I disabled your apparatuses -with skill, Commander. Skill. - A genetic mutant bastard. It seems you failed, the prisoner's dead. In one way... but not altogether. You thought you killed a prisoner? No, you're wrong. You killed my only son! We've all got a lot of explaining to do. Rick. That poor bastard. How are we gonna explain what happened to him? Nobody's ever gonna believe us. Probably not. Hell, I'm not sure I believe it now. Do you think she'll be back? That might not be all bad under different circumstances. She's one hell of a woman, on any planet.
