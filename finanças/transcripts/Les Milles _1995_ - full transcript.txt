In 1940, thousands of Germans, Austrians and stateless persons, most of them fleeing the Nazis, sought refuge in France, where they were arrested and placed in camps. This story is based on actual events. THE TRAIN OF FREEDOM Captain Perrochon. Good day, sir. Don't salute a civilian, especially in shirtsleeves. Sir, Captain Moinard is expecting you at the camp at 6.00 hours. You may go. A lot of wind here, eh, captain? Yes, the mistral. - The mistral? - Or the tramontane. The tramontane. So this is it, is it? Yes, this is it. Show me around, then. Last year this factory was making 20 millions tons of tiles, bricks and ceramics. Then the construction market collapsed, the machines broke down... Without spare parts, it closed and we requisitioned it. We? The army. The boss's house. We've put the offices there. Want to see? No. We've finished clearing up. I thought we'd have an open-air refectory - Do you have tables? - No. The internees can make some using bricks and planks. I thought, with the money saved, I could get more barbed wire. Watch your head, sir. These were the ovens. We have 2000 square metres of dormitories. Without beds? The bursar refused. But we've got plenty of straw. Straw? - I thought that the Krauts... - You did? The Maginot Line was no party! If I was fit, I wouldn't have been put in charge of Hun civilians. I don't like the Hun or overzealous soldiers. Find beds for the dormitories and tables for the refectory. Mustard gas, Montdidier, 1917. So don't annoy me, all right? Section, attention! Section, present arms! At ease. Nasty weather, eh? How are things? They're nervous, sir. What's all this about? Special delivery. - No, not children! - Dwarves. They're dwarves. In the dark... Are you short-sighted? Garraud, our head doctor. We inspected an Italian yacht off Lavandou. These pygmies were cracking open the Asti Spumante to celebrate the Reich's victories. - What will we do with them? - What? Where will we put them? Four to a mattress. You can stock thousands of them for the winter. What? Are you one of these bleeding hearts? We can't keep accepting detainees without an infrastructure. What is this "infrastructure"? - Washing facilities... - Shitters? Yes, sir, shitters. They'll shit outdoors. Very healthy. And the risks? What risks? A cold in the arse? A dysentery epidemic, for example. You're not being defeatist now, you're gloom-mongering! A dysentery epidemic indeed! Leave him, Moinard, he won't bite. What's he say? - Off with you! - Leave him, Moinard! - Let's have some fun. - Translation! He has a request. - He wants to be kept apart. - Why? He's Jewish, he gets persecuted. I'm Swiss and I get persecuted. - Stick him in a cell for tonight. - In a soapbox! You've got your own circus! You won't get bored. Enough Punch and Judy! Move it! Everyone in the dormitory! Someone once said, "As happy as God in France." The Hun are only four hours away. That's no reason to let up on the pressure. About my reinforcements... - You'll get them. - When? I don't know, but you'll get them. Charles, don't forget. Duty, duty, nothing but duty. Kruger, Georg! Kaminsky, Anton. The Swiss consul in Marseilles was here, kicking up a stink. The Swiss now! What about? He said the dwarves were under contract to a circus in Lucerne. - Who was on duty? - Moinard. They crammed into the consul's limousine and cleared off. Don't bother me, Garraud! Just let them go? Is this a camp or a sieve? Those dwarves were a nuisance. Off you go! - Sir... - They're not POWs, they're the stateless, Germans and spies. Do your own sanitary installation. Sorry, sir? Find plumbers, bricklayers, and surround the whole camp with bogs. - Showers too? - Look... I'll institute a special "sanitary" fatigue, and put you in charge of it. Now sort it out! Is this yours too? Confiscated. - Confiscated? Why? - Propaganda. Have you about finished? - Keep on and I'll burn them! - What are you waiting for? Shut him up! That's enough! There's a limit to politeness. Soldiers! Cool him down under a cold shower. Domines, Pablo. Ernest... Er... Max Ernst. Present. Schweitzer, Ziegfried. Present. Feuchtwanger, Leon. Mentores, Felix. Volinski, Miguel. Von Offenburg, Otto. Present. Yaas, Andreas. Money, jewellery, watch... papers. 517. Here. German passport. Wolf, Frank. Journalist. A journalist. So you know the law. Why were you on that road? - Coming to give myself up. - By bike? I heard that all foreigners were to be interned. I was in a hurry! You must work for a comic newspaper! Name, first name. Don't you understand French? Nine what? - Captain. - Sir? - What's he doing here? - Who? Ah... - They forgot him. - Forgot? The Swiss came for the dwarves... And him? - You'd put him in a cell. - So you forgot him. You. Yes, sir. - What do we do with him? - Make a lamp-stand of him? Right. Name and first name. Translate. Reich. Oscar Reich. - 37, Austrian. - 37... He's Oscar Reich, the footballer. So what? - Right. Religion? - Jewish. Catholic. What was that? Oscar Reich, the Viennese centre-forward? Captain Charles Perrochon, I'm in charge. Ask him how he scored two goals against Manchester in 1931. Sir, what do you think of the military situation? What? The enemy's advance? - What has that to do with football? - Nothing. I love France and freedom, so I'm worried. Have you read the rules to them? - No, sir. - What are you waiting for? "French law demands "that you obey camp discipline..." "Every soldier can give you orders, "which you must obey without protest. "In the case of an escape attempt, "the guards have been ordered to open fire. "It is strictly forbidden to have a sloppy appearance, "to gather in large numbers, "to make aspersions on the French nation "and to communicate in any way "with civilians outside the camp." Over to you. That's all. - And our letters? - No post today. You crook! Strober, Levi, Pick, shit fatigue! - Professor Pick. - Latrine fatigue. Thank you. Nothing human is alien to me. Good. Go over there. Disperse! Sergeant! Passive defence. You, you and you. Passive defence. Exercise! Translation, please! Translation! Sod it! Bordier, I'm counting on you to help with the bogs. You can, sir. I can what? Count on me, sir. Oh, I can. I can, yes... Have you found an artist for the general's tea party? An excellent pianist, sir. Mary Jane Cooper of The Boston Globe. Excuse me. I've been watching you and... You're in charge here, so... All sorts of demands must be made of you, but... Excuse my poor French. What is the point of locking all those men in a camp? I don't think your readers would be interested. Goodbye. Our readers love my articles. You didn't answer my question. Your thinking is twisted. - Twisted? - Yes, twisted. An odd way of looking at things. Do you know anyone among the internees? Do you want an interview? Then make an official request. The situation's deteriorated. Six months ago the vegetable soup was water and vegetables. Now it's water without the vegetables. You were here then? Yes. I was arrested when war was declared. French writer friends tried to get me freed. Now they're trying to get themselves freed from being called up! They don't want this war. Just one look at this soup, and you know they've lost. We've lost as well. Doubly so. But we still have our appetite. No, sir! Trotsky would never have signed with Hitler. His real name is Leon Bronstein. Do you know why Thalman was appointed by Moscow to the German Communist Party? Because Goebbels refused it. Goebbels, yes! You bloody troublemaker! Take that back right now! - Sit down! - Calm down. Sit down and eat. Opportunist! Gentlemen, the final victory will be brown! Military club He's good. I'd heard these people were good, but... What can I say? He's good. Is he a Kraut? - Bulgarian, sir. - Bulgarian. - No string quartet? - No. A pity. I've got a footballer. What do you expect me to do with a footballer? - He's very good. - Yes, but still... You expect me to put on a dribbling display for the ladies? You've done me a great favour. My wife was pining. Action was needed. Whatever the lady wants, eh? If the husband can provide it. Sir, about my reinforcements... - Reinforcements? - Those you promised. I'm pining too. It's all you ever talk about. You'll get them. But your Krauts don't look too dangerous. If they don't behave themselves rap them over the knuckles with a ruler! Ladies, the maestro is Bulgarian. A bloody good player! ...of the French government. I make to France the gift of my person... It's the end this time. They've put Pétain in charge. Aix is an open town. - You can go home now. - Not so loud, please. - Me or the radio? - Both. - Your martini. - Later. I was thinking... It's not dangerous? - The camp and so on. - What? The Germans. Have you thought about reprisals? What reprisals? Your prisoners are Germans. Won't the Hun take it out on us? - That's my business. My key! - You say that... But we have to live here all year round. You should hand them back. Look! They've passed the Loire! They've passed the Loire! They passed the Loire a long time ago, dear fellow. Some Germans are easier to stop than others. And Lyons? Where's Lyons? I can draw from memory Bavaria or Düsseldorf and all the hot spas around, but Lyons... May I? Lyons isn't far from here. If they're there, we've had it. What will they do with us? They've taken all I had. I've only my arse left! They'll have your arse too, if you don't shift it out of here! Are you superstitious, Wolf? Since 1933, yes. Did you know the number nine is unlucky for German artists? Beethoven, Brahms and Mahler each composed nine symphonies. Wagner, nine operas. Schiller, Hegel and Goethe each wrote nine workable plays. So? Well, I've just finished my ninth novel. Lights out! They burnt your books, they'll burn you artists, scientists and poets! But all they'll make us do is dig latrines somewhere else! Five of them, but they make the most noise. Your son is with them. Goose-stepping along! What can I do? When you're young, you want to be on the winning side. What are you doing? They're advancing. No, they're not. We're retreating. A strategic retreat. Yes, you could put it like that. They're advancing too quickly. They're too spread out. And your sister? What, sir? Your sister... Marinette? Louisette. Won't be long now. We're hoping for a boy. If we isolate their vanguard... Hey, you! Put your shirt on. Where does he think he is? Translation, please. Hey, stop that! Verboten, I said! Reinforcements! Reinforcements to the latrines! - What's going on? - Well, sir, they're dressed indecently. They won't obey me. They're more comfortable. Indecency is in your head, pig! The rules forbid sloppy dress. And the captain wants the rules adhered to. As the doctor, I order you to let them enjoy the sun. Bravo! It's not right, sir! Is it coming along? Absolutely. What's going on here? Is it the Folies-Bergère? They won't obey orders. Captain Garraud is on their side. As long as the latrines get built. I'm in charge of discipline. - All these men must be punished. - They're working, it's hot. So? This isn't a zoo. Proper dress. Sir, I'm a conductor. I conduct the Vienna Philharmonic. I wish to be exempt from manual labour. That Austrian arsehole doesn't want to work! You can sweep up the shit with your baton! You have no respect for talent. You're all brutes! Excuse me, sir. - Stuff your talent! - That'll do! Take those two away. The others, get dressed. It's a chaotic-sounding language, eh? Can I see? I'll teach you to act the fool! The fatigue. This is him. - Who? - The overseer. You speak French? A little, sir. You are plumber? Sorry? Mr Zippert is an architect. He built the Piscator theatre and Berlin airport. Templehof was me. - So what's he doing in France? - He's an Israelite, sir. I'd have preferred a bricklayer or a carpenter. - There aren't any. - If you're happy... Shall we? As I thought! One of us must be stalking the other. You have a nice hat. I made it myself. Can we talk? Talk? About my friends. Leon Feuchtwanger, a great novelist. Alexander Hazenforder, a magnificent poet. Franz Hessel, translator of Proust and lover of France. Meyerhof, Nobel Prize for medicine. Thadeus Reichtein, the inventor of cortisone, a revolutionary medicine. Adolf Sieberth, composer for Radio Vienna. Werner Zippert, a great theoretician of architecture. Hans Bellmer, Bruno Frei, Thomas Norhoff... - Don't forget Reich. - Reich? - I don't have him. Who is he? - Oscar Reich, the footballer. Let me interview Leon Feuchtwanger. I'll sell it the world over. - Max Ernst, then. - No. I don't want you talking about the camp and twisting the facts. They're under my protection. Don't accuse France. I'm accusing no one. You don't realise the grave danger they are in. That danger is my business. They'd die for France. What do you think we're doing? Torturing them? My readers won't understand if France delivers them to their deaths. - Who said we will? They're under my protection and that of France. I shouldn't get angry. When one only has one lung, one shouldn't have lively discussions with ladies. Lively discussions are bad for one's breathing. You know, madam, progress has always gone hand-in-hand with death. The gas that ruined my health was developed by geniuses. Not by hatters! Yes, Paris has fallen. Hands off, it's 2 francs! Paris has fallen! Paris has fallen! Latest news from the front, 2 francs! In the morning the morale is high. The demons attack later in the day. Yes, of course... Of course. An air raid! German planes. You hear the power? According to international law, we must inform the French that our internment is illegal. Sign here. Quickly, quickly! Don't let these traitors put you off. Well? The rules forbid knives. Step forward, if you're a man! The knife's owner is in hospital! - Who'll protect us? - Where's the Red Cross? What do they want? They're just worried. Reinforcements! I'll tame them! Sergeant! Reinforcements! This time the danger is too great. We cannot remain quiet. We must demand our evacuation! The Nazis are very close. They're storming forward... We have only a tiny chance of escaping them. - Let us seize that chance! - Out of the way! - Catch him! - Stop the provocateur! Comrades, we must stand united! - Did he say "comrades"? - Yes, he did. A pity. I'd rather die from French bullets than Nazi torture! Lock him up. Is it serious? When I see what's happening I'll tell you. Leon Feuchtwanger. May I have a word? The famous translator of Proust. Not exactly. Go on, then. I represent a few others. We believe our lives are in danger. Many here were condemned by the Nazis. So? Well, we think that if we hadn't been forced to sit in this camp, doing nothing, we might have had a chance of getting away. What do you want me to do? - Sir... - Not now. Give us our papers back and we'll fend for ourselves. You'd like that, I bet! 2000 off you, with no means of transport, no food, no visas... What was that? In Belgium and Holland, internees were handed over to the Nazis. This isn't Belgium or Holland! This is France! And France recognises the merits of everyone! Boisset! What will you do? Stay disciplined. France will not let you down. What measures... What measures will you take to keep us safe? My comrades... A few words. We'll be very grateful. You are under my protec... Get everyone away, Bordier! Let go of me! In danger, you say? How many? A hundred? A hundred and fifty? You want to weed us all out again? Staff HQ Is he here? - I'm waiting. - Where's Charvet? The door on the left. Charles! Come on in. You know everyone here. Lavergne, Le Besson, Staedel from Alsace... A drink? - How are the Germans? - Bad. This is more fun. Your throw. There! Bull's eye, how's that? Two francs a point. Are you in? - I want to ask you something. - Whatever you like. Staedel, stand behind the line! Maurice, I've got a problem. The Alsatian can't see straight! I have a problem. Gentlemen, Perrochon has a problem. Dédé! What are you waiting for? Come on! It's your throw. I can't control them. Do you think I'm controlling anything? All my soldiers are going on leave. It's harvest time. What's wrong? It's a cushy number. Everyone would like to be in your shoes. A word of advice... Let them slip quietly away. Things'll be clearer soon. Want some petrol coupons? I hear the German vanguard is out of petrol. Well, Maurice? Isn't there a civilian prepared to blow up the petrol tanks? Is that in? - Right in! - Really? If someone would only give me a command, there'd be no more petrol pumps waiting for the Hun. - And my reinforcements? - Your reinforcements! Get to any crossroads and you'll see them passing. I was promised, Maurice. Charles... I can't do anything without him, and he's stopped confiding in me. It's all over, Charlie. All over. - What's wrong? - He's fighting his war. It's too much. There are still my wife's trunks and the kids' toys. Too much stuff! Sir. Ah, you're here. We're moving. Staff HQ want me in Bordeaux. I just hope I can get through. What about these? Do I have to do everything myself? What will I do without them? And my reinforcements? Charles, I have no men. - I can't hold them. - Two or three days. Just hold on for a few more days. And then... Then what? Then it'll be between Krauts. Meaning? Are you stupid, Charles? The Krauts want our Krauts. We don't know what to do with them. We have other problems. What problems, sir? France must live on. That's the main thing. Independently and with honour. You mean we're to hand over our prisoners? Not us, Charles. Not us. We hand the camps over to the police. The Sûreté Nationale. I'm going to sort out the details in Bordeaux. And then the Sûreté Nationale will hand over to the Germans all of their nationals. And we... Here, make yourself useful. Carry these to the car. Thanks, Perrochon. Get a bloody move on! What are you waiting for? For Panzers to block the road to Toulon? - What is it? - The road's blocked - By what? - A flock of sheep. Move them! It was a close thing this time. You can't carry on like this. You need rest. Lots of rest. Jean! Telephone! - Jean? - Oh, good old Charlie! - Taking it easy on the coast? - No. Not really, no. I'm calling you about a passage. You too? I can't get all France in my boat! No. I'm calling you, cousin, about some refugees in my care. How many? I don't know yet. But a lot. A lot of what? Of refugees. How much are you paying? Now hang on, Jean! - What with? - I'm a cargo transporter, not a charity. The rate is 1000 francs a head. How about 500 francs? How long do I have? Thursday noon, high tide. I'll be raising anchor. You've got 72 hours. Another thing: as from today, I no longer take credit. - Right. - OK, captain? I'll call you back. What are you doing here? I was bored. I called my wife. Go back to bed immediately! The doctor told you not to move. Yes, sister, thank you, sister, sorry, sister. No! Stay there! - Are you from Annonay? - Yes. They've taken Annonay. - Your name? - Sergeant Stora. Sergeant, from now on, all you see and hear is between us two. Understand? Not a word to anyone. Drive. Railway marshalling yard The lights are down at Gardanne. What do we do? We're looking into it. Gardanne. Proceed by sight. Toulon here. There's a stationary engine on the line. Toulon, are you sure? Not yet, but it looks like it. Pass them via Aubagne. Captain Perrochon, commander of the 154th regional reserve. I've come to requisition a train. - Are you insane? - No. - A soldier. - It's jamming at Toulon, Go on, I've got plenty of time. What's going on? Sit down, sergeant. Everyone's trying to get through. Sergeant Stora, my driver. Get me several litres of coffee, at the double! - OK, Boisset? - Glad to see you. I'll take over now. - Right, Moinard? - Yes, sir. Well, move all these papers! Right away, sir. We can't control them. They beat up Corporal Lefranc today. Regrettable but predictable. You wouldn't have a razor, would you? And the reinforcements? There aren't any. The war is over. What? Sergeant, get me the German, the excitable one. - Frank Wolf. - Fetch him. He's under arrest. You know where he is, then. And the other... Feuchtwanger. As you say. The Proustian fellow. Make it so! - Coffee? - No, thank you, sir. I'm evacuating all volunteers. Sorry. I'm going to help get away all who feel they're in danger. - I don't understand. - I'll say it again. The war is over. These "scruffs" will be handed back. So? Go home. I'm helping them to escape. - Does HQ know? - The HQ are playing darts. Sod HQ! What about your superiors? They're all in Bordeaux. I'm the superior officer here! The problem, in wartime, for a soldier like me, is that lots of civilians become soldiers and cock everything up. You can't be your own master in this job. They'll court martial you, and I'll testify against you. Is that all? Yes, sir. - The Germans! - Where? Let them in. I hear that one of my men has been hurt. It's regrettable. Is that all you have to say? Have me shot. You're ready to die for an ideal. He's young. It's his first war. I understand. Talking of ideals, France will not shirk its duty. - What? - Your promises will kill us! - Soldiers! - Garraud, sit down! Say what you have to. Get it over with. It's easy for you. The Germans will come, you'll salute politely, the German commander will salute back, just as politely. No. You'll hand over the keys, take off your uniforms and go home. No, sir! Shut up a minute! Listen instead of shouting. I've decided to put you out of danger. Tomorrow I will evacuate all those who wish by railway. You have three hours to give Bordier your names. Take them away. Moinard. Let everyone know that volunteers... - Who'll decide which ones? - No one. We're taking all volunteers. Kit ready by 5. The train will be at Les Milles at 11. Going where? Bayonne, where a cargo ship will be waiting for you until Thursday noon, 50 hours from now. I say "you" because it's you, Moinard, who'll be in charge of the convoy. - Are you leaving? - Yes. Me too. Give me some hope. What are our chances? That's the third time you've asked me that. How much hope? I don't know. Five per cent. Five per cent? Really? - Come on! - Five per cent? - No, no! - Five per cent? No pushing in! Five per cent. Next! Come on, get a move on! Sign here, please. - And my money? - Yes, sign. Your money's in the bank. We haven't had time to fetch it. Sign. Section, fall in! At ease. How's morale? Good! They're divided into sections, ready to march off when I give the command. - How are the sappers? - Fine, sir. Lieutenant, here's the Germans' money. See them aboard at Bayonne, give this to the captain, tell him it's a first instalment, he'll get the rest. Sergeant, call me every four hours. I won't forget, sir. It's 11.12. You have 49 hours to get to Bayonne. The clock is ticking. You have every chance. I'd rather have shot Krauts than transported them. You should have asked for a transfer. I never asked for anything. I'm a soldier, I obey. Section 1! Section 2! Why would the Nazis harm me? Because of my haberdashery in Ste-Maxime? Because my name is Gustav Kohn? Bon voyage. Leon! Hazenforder took poison. They want to keep him here. - He can't be moved. - The Nazis will kill him. They'll deport him and kill him. Leave him! What do you take me for? I won't hand him over. If we have to, we'll give him a Frenchman's ID papers. Let me get on, you brute! Why only five carriages? - Ask the conductor. - Where is he? I was told I'd be carrying merchandise. No passengers, no conductor. I leave in 5 minutes. No bags! Throw your bags out! Hurry! Do you want to die? They won't all get on! You just try stopping them. Boisset! What's he playing at? Get this scoundrel out of here! Sergeant, give the captain the maps. Get the paint ready. When I was in Tonkin I'd pick railway workers out of the Mekong. He was a poet. Fear killed him. They must be close to Miramas. 730 kilometres in 50 hours is possible, eh? Go on, go on! And don't forget the doors. I don't want any light getting through. - It's too runny. - Yes. Get a move on! It's not a work of art! There's nothing to say. Our fate is in the hands of Frenchmen. Whether we die or get away, it's out of our hands now. I once loved a Frenchwoman. The war drove her mad, I put her in a home. I could talk about her but you don't know her, so why bother? What's going on? - The line's been bombed. - Who by? - The Italians. - We've seen no planes. They drop them at night, they explode later. They need a bridge. There are plenty in the south. Where now? To the Nazis. It's a trap! Don't talk nonsense. Sit down. Where is she? Is it true about the train? Charles! Sold the shop? That's a nice way to say hello! What's going on? Paulette, it's war! - I was right to come, eh? - I need that money. Jean's waiting for it in Bayonne. - What's he got to do with it? - Don't worry about that. Charles. Paris is full of Germans. Everyone's selling, there are no buyers, and you want me to sell up? If you didn't, why are you here? Charles... You told me you needed me, that you were ill. Where are you going? To sell my soul. - Bon appétit, madam. - Thank you. Can I have a private word? Private? Madam, a train has left. I have a problem. The train is going to Bayonne and... a boat is ready to take all those who want to go to Casa. - Where? - Casablanca, Morocco. What's the problem? Money. The skipper wants some. Understandably. - 500 francs each. - Or else? He won't let them on board. What do you want from me? You're the twisted one! You want Uncle Sam to help out. The US embassy is in Bordeaux, not far from Bayonne. No, no. Give me the name of the ship and its skipper. Thank you. No, I thank you. Just doing my duty. I'm doing my job. Eleanor Roosevelt is very interested in some of your clients. May I? There's no water. We're thirsty! There's no water! - Watch them! - I didn't see them. Don't play the clown with me! Go on, move it! Captain, the commander. I'll see to you later! The crank, sir. What are you doing? No but... You're too far north! The line had been bombed, sir. Cross the Rhône! Get Valence on the line. - What are you doing here? - Ask them. - What are you doing here? - Moinard, 154th regional reserve. What was your question again, sergeant? Sir, this bridge is closed while I carry out the mission I've been given. Camus! Bloody hell! Sir! Sir, they want to get out. Boisset, go and see. Stora, with me. What the hell have you done? It just went off by itself. - Do you have the detonator? - No, that's the point! - Bloody hell! - Sergeant. - Who wants me? - I do! Sergeant, why won't you let us cross? Can't you see we've a problem? My mission is to mine the bridge. Official! I have to get the train across before you blow it up. Who said I was going to blow it up? Did I say I was going to blow the bridge up? Cross this bridge when we come to it! Let's go. Well? They can't blow it. Meaning? The detonators don't work so the track is clear. Hang on! You mean the bridge is mined? Do we wait for the Wehrmacht? You're made of the stuff of heroes, are you? Watch out! It's inflammable! - The train, sir! - I'll take it down here. Stora? - Where are you? - It's good to hear your voice. We crossed the Rhône! - You're across? - Yes! Really? - Yes! - I'll let Sète station know you're coming. Don't stop, keep moving. You've got a bit behind. Shit, the train! I'll call again. You nearly missed it. Go and call the commander. I'm going home, Charles. You're not taking care of yourself. I hate this hotel. I've hardly seen you since I got here. - This is strange. - It was a present. The train! An attack! Who, the Hun? - I don't know. - Who? They're flying too fast! Look at that! Dewoitines. Flying low. Planes? Describe them! Short fuselage, one propeller, wings in a V. Dewoitines. They're Dewoitines! They're French planes! Do you hear me, Moinard? Don't you even recognise our own planes? Why would they attack our own convoys? Why are they flying over my train? I don't know! Listen to me! I'm holding a gun to your head. Get that convoy to Bayonne before Thursday or I'll shoot! It's all over now. Everyone on the train. What are you waiting for? All aboard! All aboard now! - Gentlemen. - When can we go again? Not before nightfall. A meal's waiting for you. If you'll come this way. What, you've made them stop? At Saint-Gaudens station? I hope you are doing all you can, but... The marshalling yard? Out of the question! No, sir! It's not carrying merchandise. You hide the convoy from aerial view, but in the station, do you hear me? That's an order! Everything's OK. Cordially yours... "Cordially"... - When? - Not before daylight. Too many trains. All over France. Captain. I can't get through to Les Milles. And we've a broken leg. Get him to the hospital. Also, five have deserted and ten have dysentery. A miracle. The soldiers are exhausted. Yes, so? There are hundreds squashed into that train. No toilets, no light, nothing. And all their food has run out. What do you want me to do? Call Tarbes and ask to be relieved? We're incognito, remember. We don't exist. It's a ghost train. So stop bothering me and just do your job. What? What is it, soldier? Soldier, help him. They won't obey. Soldier! They're Krauts! Get in your carriages! We're leaving. - Get us moving. - I'm done for today. Get the train moving, that's an order! - Thanks. - Don't mention it. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. A good, humanitarian gesture. Humanitarian? I was going to shoot Frenchmen to defend... Krauts, the Hun, Jerries... Sorry. I've given up. We've all lost our nationalities. I know. This war is a filthy business. No, not the war. It started before. Well before. Barbarity knows no boundaries. It's everywhere. How do you stand up to it? We don't know. You don't. We don't have any Nazis! They're here now. You'll have to deal with them. Your Front Populaire was paradise on earth. You sang, you danced... But what was all around you? Hitler, Mussolini, Franco. Cigarette. Men need so little to be happy. So little. An amazing capacity for forgetting. - What was your job? - Teacher. In fact... I taught German. May I? Every job is a worthy one. Any news of the train? What time is it? Soon be 10. I've lost the train. Nothing since noon. They say an armistice is imminent. Exactly! I'll be in the infirmary if you need me. Thank you. - Jean Poiblanc? - That's him. I'm Edgar Foster, from the US consulate. I have the sinews of war here! - Is that the Aurore? - That's her. - The passengers? - I'm waiting for them. - Is it in dollars? - No, in French money. 800 francs a head, right? Miss Cooper told me 500. - Miss Cooper? - Mary Jane. Who's that? Mary Jane Cooper, our contact at Les Milles. She's behind this magnificent operation. - And Perrochon? - Who? Charles Perrochon. Never heard of him. The commander had poorly guts The captain looked in a bad way And the lieutenant had mumps What an excellent bunch of Frenchmen they were! Excellent soldiers, all marching in time... Your commander? In his office, sir. Hello, Charles. What time is it? Eight, Charles. We're at Puyoô, nearing Bayonne. Is that Bayonne? Roger here, engine driver of TB 3381. I understand. - Well? - Too many trains. We have to wait. You have to know what you want, Pick. I'm scared of boats. The water, the rats, the vermin, the stink. No, thanks. Who told you it was like that? He did. He did! Do you know what it's like to drown? An awful death. - Awful. - You're pathetic. Who told them about the ship? The ghost train grapevine. We're at Puyoô, 30 kilometres from Bayonne. You'll be boarding a ship of the French merchant navy. This cargo ship... This cargo ship will take you to Casablanca, in Morocco. The war hasn't reached that far. You'll be safe. We'll walk to the port. When we get to the station, stick together. And don't talk! Everything should work out fine. Captain. Well? Now I've got you, lieutenant! Who's in command of this train? You are. Really? Who gave the order to leave Saint-Gaudens? The commander. Out of my way! The next act of insubordination will be the last! I'm not joking! I'll teach you the job! Let's get moving! I've been round two thirds of the camps. - And? - It's a lot of work, you know. The officers are doing their job, but... But what? Everything's in order. But one thing has been niggling me. The officers have been letting a few too many get away. We didn't stick them in camps just to let them walk off! Do you want our files? There's no hurry. Finish eating. I burnt the files in question. Really? See, you haven't lost your sense of humour. Right. Cut across the port. It's on the map. I'll give you five soldiers. - Why only five? - Because I said so! Quay A, cargo ship Aurore. Let's synchronise our watches. 9.54. I'll give you an hour. If you're not back at the train... Where were you last night? - If you're not back... - Where were you last night? Lourdes, at my sister's. She had a little girl. Marianne. 3.7 kilograms. No, Puyoô. 25 kilometres from Bayonne. - Where? - A gendarmerie 25 km from Bayonne. We caught a strange individual... - Jokel. - Put him on. Hey, you! Come here. Me miss train. Leave without me. Where's the train? The train! Puyoô. Puyoô. Friends in field, hungry, nothing... Finished telling your life story? - What time is it, Maurice? - 10, Charles. Go on, you're nearly there! Do you know? What? About the train. I sent 1000 men to Bayonne. You won't see them again. Oh, Charlie! You'll have to surrender your gun. With pleasure. Where is it? - Sorry about this. - No, I never used it, anyway. I'm sorry because you'll have to come with me. Come with you? With pleasure. The war's over, they signed an armistice. France is split in two. Hitler has halted. You see! I told you to just hold on. What got into you? Did you take leave of your senses? Article 19. Read article 19. "The government will hand over "all Germans, Austrians and Czechs on French territory." So? The right to asylum. Ever heard of that? Who are the losers? Us or Hitler? Even primitive societies respected the right to asylum. One must be able to lose graciously. Stuff your "graciously" up your arse! - I'll have you on a charge! - You two carry on. - I have to call my wife. - No, Charles. That's enough! You'll be able to phone from Marseilles. It's over, old man. They've signed. You can go back to your dartboard. I'm calling my wife. Then I'll stick to you like glue! Hold the line. Chief! Perruchon or Polochon. A soldier. What's going on? A military train is coming your way. There are 800 starving Germans on it. I want you to let them into the station and off the train without any fuss. Germans? I'm relying on you. France's honour is at stake. There's no such train on my timetable. I assure you it just went through Puyoô station. I understand. We obey orders and let them in. Hide all our papers. Free all lines in to Bayonne. I don't want to see a single French train on that line. The Germans are coming! Don't be mad at me, Charles. I'm only doing my duty. You don't know what duty is. Stop here! Bugger off! Bugger off! Go on! What's going on? You can't stay here. Move it! What the hell's going on? The station's closed. The Germans are coming. - What? - A whole division. - Have you seen them? - No. They're right behind you. Our orders are to clear the line. What are you on about? Clear the line. - We'll walk. - You're joking! - We're 3 kilometres from the port. - So? - We'll walk. - No, we won't! I'll switch you into Saint-Jean. - Then I'm off home! - Don't move! Boisset. My mission is to protect these men. You want to put them in danger? Over my dead body! Explain what's going on before they all get away! And that's an order! An order! Stop it! Stop it! This zone is now under German control. Stop it! Quiet! The French army is protecting you. This train is protecting you. Don't run away! Please! Don't run away! Let me explain! Listen, listen! Tell your friends we can't go into Bayonne. Why? Because the enemy is there. Don't panic! We're too late! - Papers! - Give us our papers! You have your papers! - For the border! - You won't get across! Don't even try! The consulates. Spain, America, Mexico... There aren't any in Bayonne! Don't go! This train is protecting you! Come back! Don't leave! Come on, let's go. I don't know. - And Pick? - He's gone too. - Really? - Yes. Go on. Go, my friends. What do I do, teacher? Leave. The news of the German train drove the local people onto the roads. The real Germans only entered Bayonne two days later. Max Ernst and Von Offenburg managed to reach Spain. Leon Feuchtwanger was helped by Varian Fry's famous network, the Emergency Rescue Committee, and boarded ship at Lisbon for the USA. Frank Wolf hid in the mountains before being a part of the first Resistance network. Professor Pick committed suicide in St-Nicolas camp, near Nîmes. History has forgotten the name of Charles Perrochon. A man of duty, he resisted before the Resistance existed. In August and September 1942, the Head of Les Milles camp received an order from the French police to deport 1928 Jews to Drancy, thence to be shipped to Auschwitz. Among them were 54 children "offered" by Vichy to the Germans. Subtitles - Howard Bonsor for TELETOTA
