I don't think this is it. Because she said a white house. It says 111 Christmas Street. I know 111 Christmas but this is a blue house. I don't know, maybe it was Christmas Circle. Well, did you put Christmas Circle or Christmas Street? Honey, I don't know. I don't know what I put it as. Okay, well, she said it was a white house and this is a blue house. Well, why don't we ask? It's not a big deal. We're lost. Just check one more time. Which one... There's, like, four Christmases around here. Why don't we just ask? Can you just check one more time? Honey, you told me... Just check the e-mail that she sent one more time. All right. Okay. I feel like such an idiot because... No, honey, we can't help it. Just ask. Take a deep breath. Let's just go ask. It's not a big deal. They have beautiful flowers. Which one did I say? Which one did I say? Which street? You told me 111th Street. I typed it in, and now I'm not sure where we are. What do I do, just ring on the doorbell? I mean, these people just ring the doorbell. Relax. It's not a big deal. We're lost. Check one more time which one. Honey, it says 111... It could be five minutes away from here, and we could be at the wrong place and not even know it... Vitals are stable. I don't know if it's Christmas Street, Court, Lane, Circle. Mother to Child-One. We're at set-point. - I copy. Over. - Running kismet. I read you, Lima Charlie. Help me, over. - Drone in position. - I read you same. Awaiting further instruction. Thermal is up. Getting in the networks. We are validating on our primary and secondary routes... Social media is clear. How's our airspace? Residential alarm offline. I've got eyes inside. Mother, what's your count? I've got two in the kitchen and... One in the back room. One in the living room. I have one upstairs. - I count five. - I'm counting five. I got five, too. Child-One, there's five subjects in the house. Copy, Mother. Child-One, conditions are set. Let's get in and out real quick today. No drama. Here we go. Child-Two and Five engage. Ding-dong. You got a female coming your way, unarmed. Hi. I'm so sorry to bother you, we're looking for the Larkin home. Go. My friend's supposed to have given this address. 111 Christmas. My wife, apparently, gave me the wrong address. We're visiting friends and they just moved in. But they might have given us the wrong address. I don't know, honey. You have the wrong house. Honey, I told you it's the wrong street. We're looking for 111 Christmas. Maybe a Christmas Lane... ...or a Christmas Circle? Look out! Now. You, stop. Let's go. You, here, hands on the wall. Checking the rear. - One. - Two. You, hands on the wall. Be advised, we're internal. On the wall. Closer. Three. Get up. Against the wall. Put your hands up. Sweep upstairs. Four. One unknown. Five. - Clear. - That's five. We got five, let's go. Five subjects in custody. Start the sweep. Commence SSE. Roger that. Doug, close it out. Roger that. Working on it now. - Four minutes, 30. - Clock is ticking. Turn around. Blow. To the left. I see two computers, four racks. Confirm. What about the safe? Jackpot. Turn around. Against the wall. Bite. I'm in. Child-One, commencing full dental impressions for database crosscheck. Confirm collection of all SSD drives. Roger that. Let's go, people, the clock is ticking. Two minutes. Hands up. Receiving data dump. Downloading scans. My ostensible crew. My titular crew. What's that? Hey, Bishop. Got a faint heat signal here on the second floor on the south-west corner. Can't really make it out. Sir, I'm trying to. Hmm. What is it? A squirrel? If that's a squirrel, it's a big fucking squirrel. Child-One, Mother. Strong thermal. Second floor. Strong thermal on the second floor. Copy, Mother. Child-Two, Child-Three? Go look into that. You got 90 seconds, make it quick. Clear. I'm seeing a room to your left. There's nothing on my left. I'm seeing a room to your left. There's a door to your left. It's just a wall, not a door. I'm seeing a room... Fuck. Gun. Gun, gun, gun! Mother, Child-One, looks like you were a little light on your count. I think the vest took that. - You got him. You good? - I'm good. Let's go. Sixty seconds. Child-One, what are we doing? Stay put, we're on the clock. You got to be kidding me. Assault-One KIA. Child-One, Mother. Collection is terminated. We are weapons free. - Confirm, capture to kill. - Confirm. - Confirming capture to kill. - Confirm. They're gonna torch it. - ...Christmas Street. - 911... ...just sort of really loud explosion... Fire and Police have been alerted. ETA two minutes. Thirty seconds. Twenty seconds. Okay, so you want me to waste this guy in broad fucking daylight? Confirm. You're making a mistake. I've made a lot of them. Child-One, the cavalry is en route. Get the hell out of there. Kill CCTV-1, CCTV-2. Let's go. Child-One, Mother. You're clear for four miles. We are gonna be with you for full exfil. Continue on the current route to the park exit. There will be a parking lot... Seven people believed to be members of Russia's FSB, or State Intelligence Service, formerly known as the KGB, were found dead in, what sources say, was a Russian safehouse. Sources inside the US intelligence community indicated that this was an FSB hit on its own, perhaps an attempt to manufacture what appeared to be an assault on Russian civilians, but was, in fact, a kind of suicide... This is clearly a slaughterhouse turned in on itself. ...what they describe as a quiet, safe, and friendly community. One of the victims, disturbingly, an 18-year-old Russian male. This is uncharacteristic for the KGB to be targeting... The victim, apparently 18 years of age. And this is truly shocking... White House official indicated that this was a Russia-led operation. More information will be coming out. They have been playing it very close to the vest of the FBI. Here's your non-disclosure. We're transcribing and recording. There might be a finding. We live in a new world. These are bloody times. Evil exists. Horror exists. The great game continues. If you have patience, you wouldn't have expected it to end, so... Most governments have very little patience. What is a government anyway? Does a government have a heartbeat? Does a government have ten fingers and ten toes? A government is capable of vengeance. Is a government capable of slaughter? The American people do not see their work or know their names. Lieutenant Silva showed exceptional courage in extreme danger. Subject, James Silva, age seven. He's not like other little boys. Mrs. Silva, I believe your son may be gifted. There's nothing wrong with you, Jimmy. Your mind just moves faster than the other kids. Snap this when you can't slow down. Just like that. We need to talk about your anger, Jimmy. A tragic scene on Jericho Turnpike this morning... ...killing a mother and her twin sons. A third son, 11-year-old Jimmy Silva, is in critical condition. We do have some other activities. I won't discuss those other activities at this time. It requires a change in tactics. A tightly knit, highly efficient machine. We will direct every tool of intelligence, until there's no refuge. ...ramping up of these wars outside of the war zones. Grade 546... Eyes on a blue sedan. Copy. You're clear to engage. You're authorized to go break the law in other countries, and you have the presidential authority to do it. The real abilities that we have, this is something nobody can even understand. James Silva, welcome to the new wars. I need to know before we start this conversation how bad of a mood are you in. What you want? Like one to ten? Yeah. Seven and rising quickly. There's no caesium in the crate, Jimmy. What? What was in it? Twelve cases of M4 rifles, 18 guns per case, 180 M67 grenades. We broke them to pieces, no caesium. There were paintings. We tore the canvases off the frames. There's no caesium. Repeat, no caesium. Repeat, no caesium found. Just some grenades. We tore the whole fucking thing apart. - Paintings? - Fakes. Munch. Norwegian. Munch as in The Scream? Yeah. But it wasn't The Scream. Well, this is a big fucking problem. Where's Alice? Where is she? It was her source. We all thought the source was credible, Jimmy. Just shut the fuck up. I never liked this lead. Causing avalanches. This is basically what this is, this is an avalanche. 'Cause we have now what? Sam, what do we have now? - What do we have now, huh? - Nothing. - Dougie, what do we have now? - Nothing. Six sets of caesium still missing. Eleven discs per set. That's 66 missing discs. That's 66 dirty bombs. At least. Right? We all thought it was real. Oh, it is very real. This is a big fucking problem. What is this? It's Sam's birthday. It's my birthday. Oh. Happy birthday. No birthday cake. No birthday cake. Your source sucked. - What, he lied to you? - It happens. We are well outside the realm of "it happens," Alice. Okay? This is not a case where shit can happen. We are not talking about stolen fucking ice cream cones here. I'm handling it. Oh, you're handling it? Really? Do you need help with that? No, I don't. - Who is the source? - Local special forces. You running a cop? Since when do we trust local special forces? Jesus, Alice. He's been an excellent source. Is that supposed to mean something to me that he is an excellent source? Do you want me to tell John Porter, "Oh, he's an excellent source"? No, I don't think so. That story does not work for me. It's not a story, Jimmy. It's the truth. No, this cannot not work, all right? I trusted you. Does that mean anything to you? Hello? I'm handling it. You know what's in the container? Edvard Munch. You ever seen a Munch? I mean, this guy is dark as fuck. Sounds perfect for you, Jimmy. You know, I don't appreciate that. I actually resent that. Thank you. Wow. 120 million at auction. Jimmy. He was a Sagittarius, just like you. I should have been a painter. Take a breath. Go outside. Yeah, the sign outside says "ladies." He hears everything, never listens. He listens to what works for him. So, what works for him? Actionable intelligence. And pain. The definition of a war zone is an interesting thing. Being a cop in Baltimore might be every bit as dangerous as being a cop in Baghdad. The cops played the politicians and the politicians played the cops and I don't think anyone ever knew who is on whose side. I think he got scared, Jimmy. He's an honest guy. He's been 100% reliable. Yeah, there's a big difference between honest and reliable, Alice. I'll handle it. How's that going, by the way? Do you want me to take that? - Let me get the phone. - I want to get it later. No, you'll take it now and end whatever is happening on the other side of that phone so you can return home from that planet to this one. I need you here with me. Do you understand? Can I help you, sir? Sir. Ma'am, you have a walk-in. You know what, I'll take the walk-in. You're gonna take the walk-in? I said I'll take the walk-in. Is that okay with you? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Are you sure? - You want to take the walk-in? - No, sir. Okay, then, I'll take the walk-in. Alice, handle the ex and then we handle the source, okay? Can you do that for me? Let's go. Show me the walk-in. I want a solution, okay? Not a bunch of excuses. I'll handle the fucking walk-in. Hey, how are you? I'm well, how are you? Excellent, thank... Wow, that's a beautiful pin. The government is going to seize my assets. I have $1.3 billion. That's very impressive. I know a lot of people in America. It's beautiful. I know Warren Buffett. - You know Warren Buffett? - Yes. Mr. Warren Buffett. I can pay whatever it takes. You're offering me whatever it takes or... No, no, no. No, no. - Hey. - Hey. I'm sorry I missed all those calls. I need to confirm that you are not going to be at her school on Mother's Day. You just wanted to confirm that? Correct. Diane is gonna take her... You know I can't be there. - Are you recording this? - Pardon me? You know it's illegal to record me, Luke. I am just trying... I'm the 17th richest person in this country. They liquidate my accounts, my whole family is going to be ruined. I will have nothing. Well, that's a shame. Are you familiar with Lincoln's First Inaugural, delivered March 1861? Better angels and the bonds of affection? No? All right. Abraham Lincoln was from Kentucky. You ever been to Kentucky? What about Nebraska? Where your friend Warren was born? Hi, Mommy. - Hey. - Look. You got your ears pierced? Oh, wow. You look so grown up. Your dad took you? No, Diane took me. Are you coming to Mother's Day? I thought you would make blue cupcakes with me. You know I can't be there. I'm really sorry. Okay, I'll save one for you. You know what America does not need? Another rich person scared about the liquidation of her accounts. - It's just earrings. - You know that I would... Don't give me the attitude. She wanted the earrings. And by the way, it's not Warren Buffett anymore. It's Buff-ay. - Ba-ffay? - Bu-ffay. - Buff-ay? - Buff-ay. Warren Buffett. He doesn't live in Nebraska anymore. He lives in Paris. You need the French Embassy. You speak French? I'm the mother, Luke. Oh, right. And Diane will be the step-mother, and she's actually able to be there. I'm gonna give you the personal mobile number of the French Ambassador. He's a very good friend of mine. He's gonna hook you up. He's single, by the way. You tell him that Steve Bannon sent you, okay? - This is his number. - Thank you, Mr. Bannon. You think you're the only one that's out there working? You think it's so easy? - You motherfucker. - What? I can't hear you. - You motherfucker! - Bingo. Alice, good job. Welcome back to the FamilyWizard, sweetheart. - No. - Yes. You're wizard-ed. - Wait. - Goodbye. Tell her that I love her. No! Fucking motherfucker! Are we done here now? Let's go. Sam Snel, you have a walk-in. Sam Snel, you have a walk-in. If he's alive. in twenty-four hours... we have failed. Everyone thinks they know everything now. You think you know about election hacking? You think you understand the definition of "collusion"? You know nothing. Last night we had a seven-man team at the port, acting on what we believed was accurate intelligence regarding four pounds of stolen C-139, a new form of caesium-137 radioactive powder. Just to understand the magnitude, four pounds is enough to make six major cities uninhabitable. We identified the container, there was nothing in it but weapons and some fake art, all of which Doug and Sam meticulously disassembled. No caesium was found. The intel was bad. Whose source was it? That'd be on me, John. - Whose source? - It's on me, John. How much are we paying him? He didn't want money. We tried to pay him, and he gave it away. - To who? - Local senior citizen center. - FamilyWizard. - What? He's been accurate on everything else, John, 100%. And he appears driven and motivated by something other than funding. - Fix this. - Oh, it's gonna be fixed. Every one of these events occurred as a result of a failure of imagination. Your job is not to predict tomorrow based on yesterday. That's what academics do. Your job is to prevent the end of tomorrow by using your brains and your imagination. If you don't find the caesium before it's too late, you will be held responsible for the single largest intelligence fumble since a flight instruction school in Florida failed to grasp the significance of a 19-year-old Al-Qaeda terrorist saying he didn't need to learn how to land. So fucking wake up. Very impressive list, John. Greatest Hits of Shit Show. You didn't give the French Ambassador's mobile number to a walk-in? Did you? Uh, yeah, maybe I did. I don't need phone calls from the French Ambassador, Jimmy. - Is she all right? - I got her. I don't need radioactive powder discs floating around unaccounted for. This is such shit. This is the worst fucking shit of all the fucked up shit we've ever seen. This is the shittiest, most fucked up shit... I got it, okay? Relax. Calm down. - Go take a little nap. - Fuck you. FamilyWizard? It's a divorce app. Cuts out direct communication. - It lowers conflict. - It's working. Edits your emails, copies them to the lawyers. It doesn't like certain words. Like what? "Prick. Whore. Cocksucker. Male whore, sadist. "Fucking asshole, fucking psychopath, "fucking deadbeat, fucking idiot, "fucking parsimonious, dictatorial, "abusive motherfucking..." I got it. You're upset, suck it up, okay? I have no ability to communicate with my daughter now. You're never gonna do something normal until you die. That's what this job is. I think I've lied to every person that I've ever met. So what? You really wanna get into this now? - No. - "No," what? No to your black vision of everything. If you can't fucking tell, I'm not in the mood to be light-housed. This is dark work, Alice. And you requested it. And I'm not gonna be washing strawberry jam out of my swimsuit this summer, I get to wash blood. Only maybe not because they don't make a detergent for that. And you can forget about sex on Sundays, there are no - Sundays in our world. - None. - The job comes first. - You said it. - You said it. - You said it, and you've learned well. You're starting to make me proud. - I'm not you. - You're pretty close. Just take the fucking medicine, Al, okay? It's halfway down your throat. - You need a vacation. - For what? - You need a week on a beach. - This is my beach. I love it here. There is no absolution, Al, all right? There is no washing out what we do. Unless, of course, you try that Jesus guy. I mean, they say he's very forgiving. They also say, "Thou shall not kill." You and I have put up some serious numbers, young lady. Fuck. We were not there to keep the peace, all right? There was no peace. We were there to limit the violence. Hey, get back! Sometimes that's all it takes for a guy to take a risk. For a guy to do the right thing. You, get back! Asian male approaching. Please advise. Be advised. There's one male subject right at the front gate. People are rarely rational. - Put it down. - A gift. People are highly self-destructive. On your knees. The definition of an unknown known is a thing which exists, but which you don't know about, and which you cannot even imagine. Back up! End of the road! Let me see both hands. Back. Get back. Put your hands in the air. Get back! End of the road! What the hell is that? Get back! Most sources lie right to your face. When they have what you need, they know they have the power. Let's get in the air. We are about to do something... much more powerful than kill a man. We're about to kill... the idea that... we are weak. That's my asset. - Who is he? - Li Noor. I don't wanna know his name, I don't wanna know what he does for a living, - I wanna know who is he? - A loner. No kids. No family. 100% accurate and reliable. You marked him or he marked you? I marked him. He says he has the exact locations of all six sets of caesium. He's locked it on a disc. He says only if we get him out of the country and give him asylum will he open the disc. You're gonna deal with this or you want me to handle it? I got it. This is serious, right? Oh, very. Oh, fuck. - This is an ouroborus drive. - What the fuck is that? It means it's gonna self-destruct. The entire program is gonna eat itself in eight hours. It's gonna be gone. He's smart. Time is insurance, so he gets what he wants. You fucked me. No, I didn't. You didn't? Open the disc, Li. I want out of this country now. Open the disc now. I want out of the country. The information on the disc will lead to the safe return of the stolen caesium and to the complete political collapse of the country. Which country? The country you're currently sitting in. Get me out of this country. and I will give you the code to unlock the disc. Are you under the impression that you are in a position to make demands? I tell you what I want, and you give it to me. Open the motherfucking disc. You're wasting time. Do you think that because I'm a woman I'm less capable of extreme violence? I'll go get a sledgehammer and an ice-axe and I will fuck you up. Take a closer look at the paintings. Li was a man of his word. He gave us the exact location of the caesium. He was telling us the truth on the crate. So we took him at his word on the remaining caesium locations. Certain operations require a level of violence not palatable to most people. And certain operations require a higher level of deniability. - This is Overwatch, John. - Give me a moment. You and I both know this is an Overwatch operation. What was that thing about "unadvisedly or lightly"? Oh, some things should not be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God. That thing? - Yeah. - That's the thing. I'm not gonna authorize it, Jimmy. But you can warm him up. - Oh, I'm gonna warm him up. - Discreetly. Discreetly. I really don't like diplomats. Diplomacy never works once the match has been lit to start the fire. "Oh, look at that fire. "Let's drink tea and talk about hearts and minds." No. I don't think so. How can I help you, gentlemen? I'm here to see Ambassador Brady. He won't talk. He doesn't feel safe. Oh, does he want to go back outside? 'Cause I'm not sure he'll feel safe there either. Listen up. We have a situation. Deputy Foreign Minister is here. He wants the cop. So whatever you guys are doing here, I suggest you chop-chop. Well, that makes things a little more interesting, don't it? Do not give him up, Brady. I wasn't planning on giving him up. You have any other advice for me? Anything else? You sure? No, no, just making a friendly suggestion. Thank you. You cracked it yet? I'm gonna need a little more time. You need time? I don't have any time. Didn't they teach you anything about caesium at Harvard? I didn't go to Harvard. You didn't graduate Harvard with Mark Zuckerberg? Actually Mark Zuckerberg didn't graduate. I'm not talking to you. Were you born on second base or third? 'Cause I can never remember. - I'm Scottsdale, Arizona... - I don't give a shit. They didn't teach you anything about caesium at MIT? I didn't go to MIT. Well, let me give you a little science lesson then. You know what happens when you ionize a protein? You ever read Hiroshima, by John Hersey? Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, essay on the atom bomb. 'Cause John Hersey wrote about the survivors, all right? He wrote about how he reached out to take the hands of women in the wake of the bombing in Japan and their skin slipped off like gloves. And then you know what happens next? Your kidneys fail. Your lungs collapse. You cannot breathe, you cannot think. Your thyroid just evaporates, all right? Then your lymphocyte cell count takes a nose dive. Jimmy. We're looking at approximately 60,000 people becoming Jell-O on our watch, all right? That's what this shit does. Caesium-139 is Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. Only you don't need sophisticated planes to place it. You only need a kid who can empty an envelope on a sidewalk. Do your job and crack the code. You know, I think I'll go meet the new Deputy Foreign Minister. What exactly is Silva's psychological problem? He doesn't like computer people. Fuckin' nerds. He's in the embassy. Alive? Alive. What is your name? Li Noor. - Repeat after me. Blue. - Blue. - Strange. - Strange. - Coffee. - Coffee. - Egg. - Egg. Do you know what it feels like to fall in love? Dangerous. What does it feel like to kill a man? Nothing. - Repeat after me. Green. - Green. - White. - White. Are you an agent of the Israeli government? No. Are you an agent of the Pakistani government? No. Are you involved in acts of espionage against your own government? Yes. Do you possess the code to open the disc? Yes. Can we trust you? Yes. - Romeo. - Romeo. - Juliet. - Juliet. - Where is that code? - In my mind. If transported to the United States, will you open it? Yes. Two cups of sugar. And a cup of blueberries, you... Shit! So here's the thing... We take our request for asylum extremely seriously. If you have him, Brady, we'd like him back. That's all. He's wanted for espionage. - Espionage? - Yes. - What do you mean? - How's everybody doing? If you have him, we would very much like him back. Somebody lose a dog? Fuck! You good? Yes. Any last words for your mother? What? Traitor. He's crying wolf. He's a witch. A witch? What, like a good witch or a wicked witch? Like a witch with a big nose and a broom? Axel, this is a friendly meeting. We're talking about a corrupt, low-level cop. I think the fact that you're sitting here indicates he's not so low level. I can assure you that the appropriate choice is to hand him over. You assure me? I mean, can you assure me that those circling helicopters are in our airspace for a cop not worth my time? - Jimmy... - Do you know how airspace works? Do you know there's, like, a silo that goes up from this building all the way up to Heaven? You send choppers into that silo, you're in violation, speaking of what's appropriate. Jimmy... I'm just stating the facts. This is Brady. Be careful. Oh, you fucking be careful. Where were they found? Is the situation contained? You should trust me, James. It's good for your health. Do you have men wandering our embassy? - Absolutely not. - Good. Because the men who were wandering the embassy are now absolutely dead. Let's go. Get up! Hands behind your head! Hands behind your head! Turn around! About the fog of war and imagine chaos on a battlefield. Armies. Tanks. Smoke. Fire. But it depends on your definition of battlefield. A battlefield can be a room with two people in it. That's chaos. That's fog. The assassination attempt meant that Li had to be a very high-value asset. Or a direct threat to them. Prepare my resignation papers. Either way, we had to protect him. Warriors don't wear uniforms anymore. There are no uniforms in war now. The little girl that looks like your little sister's hippie friend on holiday might be a weapon of mass destruction. The start of an operation is just like the start of anything else. Everything could go right. Everything could go wrong. Diplomacy is option one. Military's option two. When option one and option two are abandoned, there is only one thing left. Which is us. We are the third option. Special situations teams. Special missions units. Smart people on short notice to solve problems. The two teams, they are by design 2,000 miles from one another. The Overwatch location is America's most closely guarded secret. Mmm-hmm. How does it work? As soon as he's on the move, They'll switch networks. That's the loophole, that's our way in. An op is a living thing. Once you launch, the op has a life of its own. - Sam, what's the op? - It's classified. - The op is classified? - Correct. Sam, we don't need the attitude. You know what, Sam? Your attitude is turning into a real problem. You know what? I'll go work on it after you go fuck yourself. Okay, Victor? This is a Title 50 Overwatch operation. Overwatch protocols will be in effect for the next 180 minutes. The package is Li Noor. He spent seven years in our host country's elite tactical squad. He has no known family. The goal is to deliver that package from here, 22 miles to our Angel. Nine pounds of radioactive isotope, otherwise known as caesium-139, otherwise known as Fear Powder is missing. Mr. Noor knows exactly where it is. He has locked the information on a disc, and it is deconstructing even as we speak. He wants asylum. He wants America. Only when we get him to the plane will he give us the code to unlock the disc. She can only stay on the ground ten minutes. So we are extremely limited. Speed matters. We have a team of seven operators. They are no longer employees of the US government. They are engaged in a higher form of patriotism. They are ghosts. You're not a witch, are you? No. Are you? Prepare for net changeover. Ready. And in five, four, ...three, two... ...one. Child-One, Mother. We are active on new comms. OK, lock in. Do I believe in Santa Claus? No. Tooth fairy? Uh-uh. Did I believe that my three ex-wives meant it when they said that they'd love me forever? Absolutely fucking not. Did I believe that the comms were secure? Yes. We all did. - Hello, my old friend. - Yes, Mother. All good. Do you have your sneakers on? Good to go. Let's take a drive. Angel to Mother. We are wheels up. Twenty-seven mikes to LC. We'll be yo-yo for the next 27 minutes. So you're telling me you really wanna bring down this government? Why don't you give me the codes, save us some trouble? No. Anonymity is a hard concept for most coders to grasp because it's a hard concept for most men to grasp. Most coders are men. This was definitely written by a woman. Our friend here has a little bit of an ego. Changes ideology... Do you know why people commit espionage against their own government? It's mainly money, right, Dougie? That's been my experience, yeah. So if you're not into money, which I hear you're not. - Is that correct, Alice? - Right. And it's not ideology, and nobody's forcing you to do this. There can only be one possible exception. You've got a big ego. It's not ego. It's everybody's downfall, my friend. Ego is not your amigo. I'm gonna find out what bitch wrote this script. Change one number, change the idea. The package will be received in Ramstein, Germany. - You don't know me. - No, I don't know you. This government destroyed my family. Oh. When that shit goes down, if you can't go to a grocery 'cause nothing's refrigerated, where are you gonna get your milk? No. It's a very lucrative business. If you get yourself the Ferrari of goats, it's pretty expensive. You wanna text me a link when we're done with this? Check out how calm Meditation Mike is. - You feeling calm, Alice? - Not even a little bit. - Are you? - I'm totally calm. That's because you're mentally unstable. Thank you. Mother, Child-One. Starting to slow down here. You got another route for us? Yeah, there's an incident on this route three blocks ahead. Rerouting now. Want me to clear out some of this traffic? I could pick 'em off, sir. Clear... Maybe later. How's Angel? We're green across the board, sir. Cruising at 40,000 feet. Child-One, switching to alternate route. Take your next right, and we'll green-light you through the next three intersections. - Slow your roll... - All this Snapchattin', Facebookin', and bookin' a face and Instagrammin', sir. Pick up a goddamn book. Green. Two, one. You're approaching a "Y". Bear left on the "Y". Mother, Child-One. Mother, Child-One. Nice job on the green lights. Make... Make a left. Seeing additional traffic. See if we could open that up. Bishop, I've got seven motorcycles approaching quickly. They got bikes, Dougie. I see 'em. The fuck is that? Dougie, Dougie, get right, get right! Where'd that come from? Fuck! - Watch that motorcycles. - On your left! - Dougie, get right! - Get right! Where's the signal? Child-One, Mother. Status? Mother, Child-One. Looks like the threats are breaking contact. Check the tape. What'd we miss? Rewinding footage. Bishop? This motorcycle's placed something on the side of the vehicle. Base, Bretsky, Reed, KIA. Mother, Child-One, contact, contact. Vehicle is down hard. Mother, we're surrounded, need help. Multiple hostiles behind vehicles. Alice, go! Back up, back up, back up! Mother, Child-One. We're in contact. Major contact. Child-One, Mother. What is the status of the package? Mother, we have the package. The car's down hard. We're evacing now. Sam, get cover. Mother, Child-One. We need a new car. On it. They're gonna need another route. - Big eye, what do you see? - Yes, sir. Fuck! Breathe. Scan all local law enforcement. I need to know how much time we have. This car looks good. Child-One, gray BMW, about 20 meters in front of you. Dougie, gray BMW, 20 meters, one o'clock. - Yes. - Get it. Dougie, keep your 12. I'mma flank the fuck out of these motherfuckers. Stay with the package. Fuck! Ready? Go! We're getting out of here now! Where'd that come from? Silva! Threat, one o'clock. Blue jacket, magazine stand, grenade launcher. Two threats advancing towards the package from the right side. Child-One, stay with the package. Child-One, cover the package. BMW, now. Go! Look at me. I'm done. You did good. Child-One, get out. Now. Go, go, go. What the hell happened back there? Our car is made. We need a safe house. We need to regroup immediately. No! Not a safe house! How far is it? 2.3 miles ahead. Is this your idea of justice, huh? Shut your mouth! Take me to the airport. Is it secure? I had three hours to vet the place. Fuck vetting. I don't wanna hear vetting! Is it secure? You know what? I want the code. And I want the code now! I don't give a shit about your family. I don't give a fuck if you had three hours. I take you, and I throw you out the side... Yes, with high confidence, it's secure. See? That's all I needed. High degree of confidence. Just take me to the airport. I'll give you what you want. Take the next two rights. Take the next left. 2-1-4-7-2 is your intro. Third garage on the right. - 214. - 72. Entering the den... Getting in the networks. Visuals up. Contact is bald, male, 48 years old, blue shirt. This is everything they asked for. Examining for possible threats. Do you have any identifiable threats, weapons? Any hostiles? No anomalous behavior detected. Clean vehicle will be there in six. Clean vehicle will be there in six. We're identifying the city. Noor files downloaded. Looks like maybe a study abroad during university. Why would that be redacted? We need all police to clear out the West Papua district. Be advised. Police are being ordered to clear out of the area. Let's get ready to move. Jimmy, we don't leave the reservation. We've got armed motorcyclist... Armed motorcycles on either side of the entrance to the bakery. Angel, Knight. Unexpected delay. Get the fuck out of there. Attack on an American officer is an act of war. I need him back right now. Let me give you some advice. You ready? Stop. You hear me? Stop. This is nothing personal, man. - I'm just doing my job. - I'm just doing mine. Sir, I got the scope on the man. You want me to take the shot? No. Please, sir? I heard there was a little unfortunate incident on the highway. A little incident? I would really hate for it to happen again. Are you threatening me? We can do this however you wanna do it. You gonna keep coming at me until you kill us all? Yeah. That's a weird fucking game, but okay, I'll play. I mean, you have home court advantage. You have a larger team, unlimited resources due to the support of a phenomenally corrupt government willing to kill innocent citizens. Plus, a local special forces which we designed and trained and built for you. Stop monologuing, you bipolar fuck. I think he's more manic-depressed. Or narcissistic disorder. - Dissociative disorder. - He's just an asshole. And let's not forget about your absolutely medieval moral compass and nasty thirst for bloodshed for which there has been no legal repercussion because you do not operate under any rule of law. Chaos. - That's right, Jimmy. - Yeah, but you know what? What's that, Jimmy? I think I might just be a little worse. Child-One, Mother, move the package now. Get him in the car now. Let's go. Let's go. Bomb! Get down now! Child-One, Mother. Status, please. Shit. - Anywhere else? - I don't think so. Let's go. In the fucking car, now! Let's go. Child-One, gunmen. Go. Move! I've got package in tow. Okay. Alice, status? He is fine. Come on, Dougie. Get your shit together. He is fine. You just keep fuckin' driving. You pull this shit on me now? Mother, package in tow. We have one critical. We need a new vehicle ASAP. What's the ETA on the plane? - Twenty-two minutes. - How many miles out are we? - Twelve. - Child-One, no time. Get your ass to the airstrip now. Copy, Mother. - Go, go! - Spread out, spread out! Get him in the building behind us. Get out of my face. Go. Now. I got you. Yeah. You've got it? Paradise Apartment Complex. I got you. I got you. Oh, you give 'em hell, Dougie. You just get him to the airport. I will. All right, brother. Every normal man must be tempted at times - to spit upon his hands... - Alice! ...hoist the black flag... Silva, you better be moving. ...and begin slitting throats. Fuck. - We got a car? - I do. Mother, Child-One. You gotta get us the way out of here ASAP. Child-One, working on extraction point. Get to the south staircase. Alice, this way. I repeat. Get to the south staircase. Copy that. Heading south. Sir, I've got eyes. Come on. Mother, we are on the fourth level. What's the route? How the fuck do I get out of here? Extraction point is at the end of the second hallway, coming up on your right. Child-One, exit is 20 yards in front of you. R-447. That'll take you to the extraction point in the rear courtyard. Shit! Back up, back up, back up! Go. Fuck! Move, move. Back up! Back up, back up. Now! They're separated. Fuck! Jimmy, do you copy? Jimmy, do you copy? Mother, I have the package. Do you have eyes on Alice? - Mother? - Negative. Mother, Child-One, reroute us. The route out is directly behind you. Take it. Stairwell, Romeo-445. - No. - Child-One, no what? No! I'm want a route to Alice. Reroute me to Alice now. It's before Bingo Fuel. Where's the package? Ten minutes. We're counting. Child-One, it's time. You understand a little girl who calls her mother every day because she misses her? Because her mother is not home with her? She's here with you. She is here for you. Option one, open the disc and end this. Exit. Option two, we let her die. Repeat, the order is to exit. Now! Let's go get her. Let's go get her. Son of a bitch. Do not fuck me. Let's go. Mother, Child-One. Make it dark in here. Fine. Go. Stay here. Silva, do you copy? Silva, do you copy? Silva, do you copy? Hey, Jimmy, all you had to do was hand him over. Who? You mean the low-level cop? What's the rush, Jimmy? You got somewhere to be? - Fuck you. - I could do this all day, baby. Please. I'm a... Please, I'm a mother. Please. I have a... I have a daughter. Hey, Jimmy, you and I, we could have made a great team. You happen to have any more .45 caliber ammo back there? Here it is! Let's go. Now. Move. Fucking wasted 10 minutes coming back for you. Child-One, Nissan pickup, back parking lot. Repeat. It's at the back of the building. Come on, come on. Let's go. Mother, Child-One. What's our route? Child-One, stand by for new route. We have their location. Let's go. Child-One... Child-One, the route is directly behind you. Take it. - Engines turning. - Copy that. Roger. We're buttoned up. Oscar Mike. - We are set. - Let's go. The end of an operation is euphoric. It's placing that last piece in the puzzle. You know the euphoria cannot last. Ten minutes to Bingo Fuel. Where is your package? Window is closing. We need to be wheels-up now! Get your ass to the airstrip now. Yeah, I'm working on that. You tell yourself, "This one time..." If I wait, we're all gonna die. Hurry the fuck up! "...just might be different." "Just might be different." Have you confirmed with the ground team? Yes, they're ready. Good. "Today I just might be able to just hold it, catch it "in my hands and look at it." Tell them to stop the plane. We're here. Mother, we don't have time for this. - King. - Yup. Child-One, Mother. My pleasure. Target acquired. Take it. Let's go. What's the status of the plane? The LZ's hot. We're rolling. Child-One... You tell those fuckers to wait. They're gonna stay put no matter what. Overwatch is requesting... Negative. The window is closing. Tell those pilots I don't give a fuck! Tell 'em we're here. We're on the runway now. Holy shit! Abort! Abort! Abort! Abort! Abort! Abort! Abort! Copy that. We're aborting! Okay. Tell me when the package is there. Copy. Let's go. Move. Code. Now. Hey. You got something for me now? R-O-Z-H-D-E-S-T-V-O... 1-1-1. Mother, Child-One, Rebel, Oz... R-O-Z-H-D- E-S-T... - Trust, Virgin, - Oyster, triple-one. - V-O-1-1-1. This is a hard line of work. What line is that? Witchcraft? Our line. We are not in the same line. Respectfully. Respectfully, we are. It stopped. The clock stopped. We have five locations of the caesium. Five locations have been confirmed. They're being sent to Langley. He's clear. Put him on the plane. Go. Hands up. Embark. He's clear. This might actually work. - Okay, we're rolling. - Let's move. Let's get this package out of here. Clear. You got six days. Go. Go be a mother. Go. I'll be back in five. Oh, hey. Say hello to your Mother for me. My what? Say hello to who? What the fuck did you say? What are you doing? It's odd. They're spiking. Maybe he doesn't like planes. Madam General. It's almost time, would you like to watch? Yes. Bishop, look. It's taking over our computer. It's not done encoding. Who's that? Who is that? What is this? Meditation, Alice. Keeps me focused on the job. The code is Russian. Jesus. All things Russian. The code word is Russian for Christmas. It says 111 Christmas... Christmas Street? It's a Trojan horse op. Take off, wheels up. He's not a double agent. He's a triple agent. Oh, my God. He's a Russian. Child-One, Mother. Keep them on the ground. I repeat. Keep them on the... Gotcha. No! This is a very simple story. Killed the wrong kid. Eighteen years of age... A mother lost her son, and it turns out she was a very powerful lady. Failure of imagination. You mean the death of Overwatch. Death of what? Overwatch. You were the target. Mayday! Package is armed and attempting hostile... He did everything right. He was unpredictable. Highly trained. Recruited when he was young. He convinced us he did not trust us, and then convinced us to trust him. Do you wanna talk about Alice? Do you wanna talk about what happened on that airplane? Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Cockpit has been breached! Package is armed. Direct to immediate LZ. No. You already know this. Tell me again. I've already gone over this with you. They activated him to make us activate Overwatch. Say hello to your Mother for me. Bishop, come in. Can you hear me? Bishop, can you hear me? Bishop? Over. I think there is no defense against someone willing to die. Someone capable of cultivating our trust by offering us the one thing that we want, and the one thing that we need, that's the real weapon of mass destruction. A killer who looks like a hero. The great game continues. Today was yours. I'll see you tomorrow.
