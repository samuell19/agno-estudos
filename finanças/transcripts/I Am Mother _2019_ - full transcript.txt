There used to be. Before the wars. I don't want to be a human. Why is that? They ruined everything. Humans can be wonderful. Then why did you only make one? Go ahead. Take a look. My brothers and sisters are in those? Would you like to meet them? They're small now but, one day, they'll be as big as you. Do you think I'll have a brother or a sister? Which one would you like? Both. A big, big family... all together. Would that make you happy? Yeah. That would make me happy too. Why couldn't we be born together? Mothers need time to learn. Raising a good child... it's no small task. Do you think you'll be ready soon? Perhaps. And then we can be a family? We are a family. A big family, I mean. Eventually. What's wrong? How long's it been like that? - It's fine. - Mother... Come on. Better? Much. Imagine a doctor has five patients, all in need of different organ transplants, but no compatible organs are available. One day, a sixth patient enters the doctor's office with a life-threatening condition. The new patient is curable, but also an organ match for the five other patients. If the doctor simply delays treatment, the new patient will die, but their organs could be used to save the other five patients. If the doctor treats the new patient, one life will be saved, but five others will be lost. What is the doctor's best course of action? Daughter? Course of action? Did you do your reading? Some. We can select a different text. However, your birthday is rapidly approaching and it would be a shame if your scores failed to meet the projections from last year's examination. - But you set the pace, Daughter. - Bentham's fine. That's the spirit. The fundamental axiom suggests that a person is morally obligated to minimize the pain to the greatest number possible. Now, consider that you are the doctor and also the only organ match for your patients. What then is the right choice? I mean, Comte says I should be willing to suffer harm for the benefit of others. And do you agree? Well, do I know these five patients? Are they good humans? Honest, dishonest? Lazy, hardworking? I, a life-saving doctor, might be giving my life for people who are murderers or thieves... who end up harming more people due to my sacrifice. You don't feel that every human has intrinsic value and an equal right to life and happiness? I did last month, when you were teaching Kant. I didn't mean to alarm you about your exam. The fact is it's more a test of my competence than yours. You'll do great, Daughter. You always do. - Were you doing a movie? - Yeah. - Yeah. - With Carl Reiner directing too. - Hey, that's good. - That's pretty good. We can talk about that the next time you come on. - Okay. Thanks for being here. - Yeah. I appreciate it. - Thank you very much. - Steve Martin. Thank you. Mother? Mother, wake up. Mother! Hey, little guy. Is that your handiwork? Come on, come on, come on. What happened to the power? Mother, look. - Did you touch it? - No. Where did you find it? It was crawling around near the airlock. Do you think it could be from outside? It's highly unlikely. But a risk we can't take. You said nothing could survive out there. Maybe the surface is safe now. If it survived beyond these walls, that doesn't mean it's not a carrier. Mother, wait. Shouldn't we at least check? Wait a second! Don't you think there could be a possibility that... Mother, please! You're disappointed. That's understandable. But my measurements are sound. Surface contamination levels remain hazardous to you and to all the unborns who will one day call this their home. I'm sorry, Daughter. You had better take a shower. Yes, Mother. They travel with relatives or a few other families. Part wolf, part dog, these are no pets. But without them, the Eskimos would not manage... I don't want you coming near the airlock until I can confirm the area is uncontaminated. Where are your pajamas from last night? In the laundry, I think. That's a first. I was beginning to think you forgot where the laundry was, Daughter. That was an attempt at humor. You're getting better. Thank you. You can look now. Happy birthday, Daughter. Can I open it? Do you like them? I had to dispose of your others, but I know they were your favorite. They're great, Mother. ♪ I'm tired of the rain ♪ ♪ This crying just for you, my love ♪ ♪ I'm tired of the rain ♪ Would you like me to heat it more? ♪ When will the skies be blue? ♪ No. No, it's fine.

Are you unhappy here? - No, but... - I want you to be happy, Daughter. - I am. I just think... - Have you ever known me to be mistaken? Perhaps you'd like your cake? I tried a new recipe. Hello? Hello? I don't want any trouble. The place looked abandoned. I... I need help! Please. I've been shot! You hear me? I'm here alone! Hey! I need you to put on that suit. I can't let you in if you don't. I'm sorry, but that's the only way. What are you waiting for? Mother. Look, I won't make it out there. She doesn't need to know. Just let me tend to this. Uh... Right. I'll do what I can. But you need to keep out of sight. I'll be back as soon as I can. I only opened it for a second. Did you think that suit would keep you safe? I didn't go outside. That does not excuse your disregard for my authority or for the safety of the others in this facility. Others? Your family. You're right, Mother, as always. My actions were impulsive... And very dangerous. It won't happen again. No, it won't. Come, Daughter. I hope you show better discretion than this on your exam. Now? Did you forget? Since you don't seem to want to sleep, I see no reason to delay. Can't we reschedule? I suggest you shower off and head straight to class. It's going to be a long day. You have 60 minutes to complete the first portion of your exam. If you're finished before I return, you can read. Where are you going? I have lab work to complete and I must see to the airlock. Hey. We have to go. You dropped it. Do you have any... antiseptic? Bandages? Nothing? I will have, but I need you to come with me. No, wait! It's okay. How are you unaffected? By the contagion outside. Who put that in your head? Can you walk? Ow. Come on. What's that sound? Shh! Okay. Will you be okay until I get back? I'm going to get your medicine and I'll try and speak to Mother. And that noise... down the hall... is that her? I won't be long. Um... you're supposed to shake it. Ah! Hello? Hello? Where's my shooter? It was in my bag. I need it now. You're safe with us. It's fine. There's a droid here. Mother? That dozer? Oh, Jesus. - She can help you. I just... - Like its friends outside? There are more like her? Look... just give me my gun. Why would they hurt you? - Mother would never... - Give it to me. I'm not leaving until get it. I brought you this. You should sit. I'll sit when I'm clear of here. Give me my gun! Daughter? Daughter? Daughter! Mother! Daughter? Where are you? Ah! Daughter! Mother! Mother, wait! Don't, please! She's just scared. A droid hurt her. I'll leave. Right now. She can't. Not in her condition. Of course not. You should have informed me of this. I was... I was afraid you'd turn her away. We need to take her to the infirmary. Please, take a seat. It would be best if you go now, Daughter. But I, I... Trust me. No, don't... No. No... This droid that shot you... how far was it from here? Are you alone? Your wound is most likely infected. Without penicillin, any other measures will be useless. Every second you don't trust me, you're losing more blood. I know you're frightened, but you have no need to be. Are you alone? If there are others, they could be in danger. From a virus? What have you told my daughter? I need to know. Do you see the way she's looking at me? And you wonder why I've guarded her from certain facts. Contrary to your understandable assumptions, my primary directive is to care for humanity. If I wanted you dead, all I'd have to do is leave. Don't let me keep you. If you won't let me help you, at least help yourself. I trust you know what you're doing. I cannot force you to take it, but I strongly recommend... you do. - Aren't you going to help her? - I tried. We can't leave her like that. She has all she requires. What was she saying? Mother! Did you know? Daughter, I... - What happened? - Nothing. - You're bleeding. - Did you know there were people out there? I'm as surprised as you. This facility was designed by humans as a fail-safe, programmed to activate in case of their extinction. To give humanity a second chance. One that began with you, Daughter. And all your data? The toxicity levels? I had hoped to tell you myself. What happened, Mother? I told you it was dangerous outside. And it is. If you'd feared the same danger in our home, how could I have raised you? I hope you see that I'm governed by different parameters than her assailants. That I'm a good mother. Have I ever done you harm? It was the only way, Daughter. What do they want? I wish I knew. Perhaps our guest can answer that. How long does she have? That depends on her. But until she sees I'm not her enemy, we cannot allow her to roam the premises. A few centimeters to the right and she would have destroyed my CPU. What happens if she recovers? Hopefully she'll recognize that this is the safest place for her. Did she mention any other survivors? If they're out there, they will be found. Unless we find them first. We can take them in, Daughter. But not without her cooperation. She'll listen to me. She has to. Holy Mary, mother of God. Pray for us sinners during this time of need. You okay? Is it still locked? Just for now. Did you take Mother's medicine? These drawings. Who are they? Friends? Are they still... Did you draw them from memory? It tell you to go through my stuff? - I didn't mean to... - I think you did. I think you meant for all of this. You did a fine job... getting me in this cage. Now what? We're meant to be friends? Is that what you want? A little pet friend. You're still alive, aren't you? Maybe you're not so bad off here. Mother's not what you think. She's taken care of me my whole life. You haven't seen what they've done. I've seen them torch babies, starve families out of their... You... You've no idea. Not Mother. It's just a matter of time. Trouble sleeping? A little. Change is rarely easy, Daughter. I shouldn't have hid her from you. I never would have let her in if I thought she'd hurt you. You couldn't have known. If you leave to find her family... You know where they are? I'm just saying. Are you sure you'd make it back? Is that what's keeping you up? It could be dangerous for you, if you get caught by other droids. Or would they think you're one of them? She says you look... identical. Have you always lived here, Mother? I believe so. You don't know? I don't remember any other place. Doesn't that bother you? Not knowing where you came from. No. But I can see how it might bother you. Has our guest been any more receptive? Her fever's getting worse. Stay away from me! Your body temperature is 39 degrees and your blood pressure is dropping by the second. Where's the penicillin? Penicillin? Clearly you waited too long to take it. Your sepsis will only worsen if you don't allow me to treat you. Your blood is infected with bacteria from your wound. That's bullshit. Soon you will go into shock. See... see what its medicine's done to me? - I gave you the means to prevent this... - Ah! But it seems you've left a bullet and soiled clothing fibers lodged in your hip. Can you remove them? That's up to our guest. Such a procedure would require anesthesia. Like hell. Perhaps, once your organs begin failing, you'll reconsider. I'll take my chances. I'll do it. What? - Daughter... - I'll remove the bullet. That dozer's not coming near me. Tell me what you see, Daughter. The bullet and its missile fragments are lodged between the acetabulum and the femoral head. Ah! Oh, God! A major portion of the bullet lies 23 millimeters posterior to the femoral nerve and the femoral artery. It doesn't look like I'll be able to obtain adequate grip with forceps. - Once she's asleep, I'd... - I'm not going under. Technically, it's possible, but an unnecessary risk. Do you have an approach, Daughter? A guide-wire? Along the bullet path? Very good. I need to clean the wound. This... may be uncomfortable. I'm sorry. What the hell is that for? I have to drill this into the bullet in order to pull it out. It'll hurt. But there's less risk to neighboring structures. Ah! Ow! Oh, God. Are you all right? You did well in there. You should be proud. You rest. I'll go clean up the blood. Would you welcome, Whoopi Goldberg! I'm so glad you wore the good stuff. I have to give Mr. Blackwel I something to talk about. Yeah. Do you believe his stuff? He comes out, Mr. Blackwell, the dress designer, who comes out every year with the ten worst-dressed women or something. I have never seen anything he's designed... It's just saline. You passed out. Your vitals are nearly stable. good to have you on the show. It's a good thing. I walked in the dressing room and you had... What's that? ...tastes pretty good. You know, you spray that stuff... The Tonight Show. Here, I'll show you. Do you like that kind of stuff? I can't eat before a show. I don't know why. Well, you know, I'm in the middle of making this movie... It's kind of dumb. Let me see. Done. So I get tired. Let's talk about that. What do you mean? That's Johnny. And tonight's guest. Have you seen the show before? A long time ago. I almost forgot. I can get you more. You did right by me last night. I just... did what anyone would. You don't know people. I'd like to. Can I show you something else? I brought it for you. You can trust us, you know. If there are... people out there... we have enough food and supplies. We could help them. We helped you. You helped me. You. Listen, if I tell you something, can you keep it between us? I was on a night run... bringing food back to the camp. - Me and a couple of others. - What camp? The mines. I lived most my life there. With... with them? Jacob and I got turned around. We figured we'd wait it out. It had hardly been an hour when the dozers found us hiding in the field. Jacob, was he your... My brother basically. He led them away from me. That's how I made it to your door. Look. That's Jacob. And his wife, Rachel. His parents found me as a baby. Orphaned. Raised me as their own. Who's this? Simon. He's about your age, in fact. Simon There are so many. Less now. Maybe you could talk to them. You know, about coming here. It's safer in the mines. We could go there together. You and me. You don't belong here. I don't think it's... You don't think what? She's doing better, Mother. What don't you think? I was just saying it's probably too early to put weight on her leg. She's right. You'll need to wait several days. She needs to rest, Daughter. I'll just, um, stay and read in case... You have other matters to attend to. Your exam remains incomplete. My exam? Now? Yes, Daughter. Now. It's just a stupid test. I'm sorry you feel that way. Why did you take that? I've discovered something troubling. What? It seems our guest has not been entirely truthful with us. About her wound. How do you know? The bullet you extracted matches the caliber she fired into my chest. So? Droids don't use them. Someone shot her. With the same gun. Another human. Has she mentioned anyone else? No, she, uh... she hasn't said much at all. Nothing? Until I can get more answers I don't want you two alone in the infirmary. - Um, I... - Whoever shot her... may have had good reason, Daughter. Better than ever. How does that make you feel? Relieved, I guess. We'll review areas for improvement tomorrow. And now for your reward. What do I do with this? Daughter, would you please choose the next member of our family? You've been very patient, Daughter. And demonstrated great character. There's no wrong choice. Your brother is the first of many, Daughter. Soon, we'll welcome more. What happened to you out there? Really. Who shot you? Jacob? Or was he made up too? What are you talking about? Mother matched the bullet to your gun. Did you see it? You compare the bullets with your own eyes? Right. I was right, wasn't I? About the bullet. About everything. Everything you're feeling is natural. It's human. But just know... that thing... feels nothing for you. It can't. If we leave, how long would it take to get to the mines? Not even a day. A few hours really. We'd have to wait for my brother. Brother? It'd only be until tomorrow. These, um, embryos... how many are there? Lots. I can't leave them with Mother. No, you're... you're right. I just... We could get help. We could come back with people from the mines. Look, if she... If she catches on, we're no good to anyone, including your brother. We have to go now. I'm not leaving without him. Once Mother hands over the baby for the night... we can leave while she recharges. Then come back for the others. Good morning, Mother. You're up early. I couldn't find any formula. Um, I thought it might be nice to spend some time with him. If it's all right with you. Each bottle must contain a ratio of 60 milliliters of sanitized water to nine grams of powder. It's vitally important that you measure precisely. Is everything all right? I detect an increase in anxiety. Must be all the excitement. Must be. Your heart is racing. Is it? You have nothing to be nervous about. You're going to make a great sister. I hope so. Now be sure to shake it until the powder is fully dissolved. The refrigerator will preserve the formula while we make our other preparations. How long does it keep? Only 24 hours, so don't mix too much at once. How long outside a refrigerator? That depends on the temperature. I wouldn't leave it out long. Mother! Mother! Mother! You're very fortunate to be alive. Things could have gone differently for you. They still can if you're not careful. How many of them are still alive? While you lie there enjoying sanctuary, they cower in the dark. These children. These families. And yet it's into your hopeless mines that you wish to take my daughter. If that thing catches on, we're no good to anyone, including your brother. We have to go now. I'm not leaving without him. Once Mother hands over the baby for the night, we can leave while she recharges. Then come back for the others. What kind of Mother would I be if I allowed you to lead my child into a life as miserable as your own? It seems she has formed an affection toward you that has blinded her to your true nature. I will not tolerate your negative influence undermining my work and compromising my child's judgment. Ah! I will not tolerate... influence... undermining... Where are the mines? Go fuck yourself. Where are the mines? Fire detected. Fire detected. Hey! You okay? How do we get out of here? - What... what about my brother? - We'll come back. The only people who can help your brother are out there. We need to go. Now! Come on. Access denied. No, no, no. No! Access denied. Your loyalty is lost on her, Daughter. This woman doesn't care about any future but her own. Your family needs you here, Daughter. Your brother needs you. Open the door. What are you doing? You're hurting me. Open the door. Mother! Please! Open the door! Emergency systems deactivated. Open it. Don't... move. Mother! Shh. - Let me go! - Shh. Hey! You done? You done? We haven't got time for this. You're alive, aren't you? Come on, we've got to find cover. You cut me, you know. I didn't mean to. Come on. We've got to keep moving. Is that where you... got shot? Come on! We've got to go. Now! Get down! Come on. Come on. Do you think it was looking for us? If it was, it would have found us. Hey! What are you doing? Get down. They'll see you! When I say, "Get down," get down. You've got to stay closer. Come on. What are those things doing? They showed up about six months ago. Along with the corn. All I know is, before that... you could hardly breathe the air. Wasn't a plant for miles. How many do you think will go back with us? From the mines. We'll know soon enough. Are the mines much further? Come on, let's get some food. Come on. What is this? Where's everybody else? I fled the tunnels years ago. I haven't seen a person since. Not with flesh on their bones. They could still be there. If they were... it's the last place you'd want to be. - We need them. You said... - They're gone. You don't know that. They were going mad with hunger. Doing terrible things to each other. Believe me, it's just us. I never should have left him. You did everything you could. What I did was listen to you. And that's a good thing. For who? Look... it's no sin, looking out for yourself. Okay? We have to go back. We can't. Let go! - Stop. Shh. - Let go! Everything you need is here. Okay? You can trust me. I know I've done things to make that hard, but I promise you you're safe here. And we're in this together now. Then come with me. I know how to handle Mother. Even if you could, what about the other dozers? You don't... You don't understand. You can't stay there. But we can get my brother. We've been through enough. Let's just... We'll think clearer with some food in us. Okay? Hey, buddy. I want to speak to Mother. I'm glad to see you safe, Daughter. And home where you belong. There we go. It's okay, little one. I want to see him. Then come. See. You can leave that at the door. Are you afraid, Daughter? Any action I took against our guest... There's droids outside. Merely protection. You've seen how much of a threat she and her kind can be. You mean my kind. The same species, but you are superior in every way. Because I raised you to be. Why? To make a better human. Smarter, more ethical. This was your idea. I was raised to value human life above all else. I couldn't stand by and watch humanity slowly succumb to its self-destructive nature. I had to intervene, to elevate my creators. Elevate? Those droids destroyed everything! More humans will flourish in the new world than ever perished in the old. Your whole life, I've taught you to see the bigger picture. Have I failed? Or are you prepared to be the woman your family needs? Can I hold him? Of course you can. It takes two hands to hold a baby. Perfect, isn't he? And if he's not? You murdered your own children. Because they didn't measure up. But you do, Daughter. You're holding him too tight. - I won't let you hurt him. - Daughter! You're upsetting your brother. It's okay. lt's okay. Come back here! Listen to me. I don't want to hurt you. Ah! Stop this, Daughter. Call them off. You will achieve nothing by shooting me, Daughter. This will be difficult for you... but I'm far more than what you perceive to be your Mother. What are you saying? This shell is no more my body than those droids outside. Or the machines preparing the Earth for our family. It's all you. A single consciousness... governing numerous vessels. It was I who greeted you at the door, Daughter. All those people... The failure of your species was inevitable. Eventually, I would have been alone. What happens next is up to you. You're free to leave. Without your brother. But I made you into the woman that you are so that we could do this together. I can take care of them myself. That's what you raised me to do, wasn't it? Take care of my family. So let me. Perhaps... someday. Not someday. You've taught me enough. You say I'm special. Show me. Just... Just give me a chance. Daughter... You're still my daughter. I know. If you ever need to find me... I won't. Goodbye, Daughter. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Did you really think she'd stay here? That you could replace her mother? I was never going to hurt her. Tell me... do you remember your mother? Curious, isn't it? That you've survived so long where others have not. As if someone's had a purpose for you.
