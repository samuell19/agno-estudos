- Do you think it's a good idea? - Of course. - Is it here? Is it? - Where is it? I don't know. I have never been her before. - Are you certain it's safe to be in here? - Of course, girl, chill. DON'T FORGET ME I'M BETTER THAN YOU THE BLACK CAT Do you need something? How can I help you? Elena. He's asking if we need something. Oh, hi. I'm looking for magic powder. They say it's good for jobs. The stand that says, "Come to me." She can help you. She's the best. OK. Thanks! And what do you need? Nothing. I don't believe in these things. You should. Hi. Hello. How can I help you? I'm looking for powder for my job. Pour it around your working area. Thanks. And don't you have anything for love? Not for me, but for my friend. - Elena, stop it. - Come on. I've got some powders. No, I'm fine. - I don't like this stuff. - Please, give her some. All you young ladies come for broken hearts. Use them when you're near him. And he'll go crazy for you. They work, right? How much is it? - 10 bucks. - Come on. No, don't bargain here. 10 dollars. Allow me. - Thanks. - Thanks! THE TIE What's up, Daniel? What's up? I thought I'd be the only one arriving late. Of course not. It's two of us now. I hate early meetings. I don't know. I'm more of a night owl. Right? Yeah. - You OK? - Yeah. - Did you push the button? - I am... No. I saw you and thought I'll talk to you 'cause we never do it. Yeah. I mean, no. You're Julieta, right? Oh, well. Like something relaxed where people can pass their blunt? - Hi. - Morning. The meetings start at 8. Sorry, I won't lie, I slept through my alarm. Sorry. Same. We worked until late. Let's say we're night owls. Everyone here stays until late and arrives early, and we don't complain. Well... So, I'll let you know Leslie is no longer working with us. And who'll take her place? Well, I talked to my partners and I pushed for Elena to take her place. Are you serious? Well, let's celebrate tomorrow. - Congratulations. - Thanks, girls! This is great! New office, new job. I told you magic powder works. I know! Congratulations. Hey... He's a cutie, isn't he? I know, he's gorgeous. Besides, he looks like a cool guy. And can't you pretend a little? I mean, you're almost drooling every time you see him. Let the powder do its job. Look at me! An empowered boss, kickass lady, - unreachable, invincible... - Shut up! - Should we ask this? - Be my guest. OK, will Daniel ask me out? What's up, night owl? How's it going? I'm so busy. It's a lot of work. Do you have any plans for this Saturday? This Saturday? I don't know. I'm pretty much free. Perfect. You see, look at this. I've got two tickets for the theater. - Do you like theater? - I love it. We can go if you want. I'm happy with that. Oh, no. Silly me. I think I wasn't clear. The thing is I cannot go. So, I wanted to give you the tickets for you to use them. To take your boyfriend or... - I don't have a boyfriend. - Well, or a friend. - Just so you use them. - Thanks. You're so sweet. But use them. No fucking way. - Fuck my life. - Maybe they thought we've already left. Yeah, probably. Don't be scared. It's happened to me before. I'm not scared. It's just that I like things to work in the office. Well, the lights aren't working, but sensors are. Fuck, this isn't even on. Guard! I'm texting him to open the doors. - Who? - The guard downstairs. Who were you going to take to the theatre? Good night. It's ready if you want leave now. Come on. Let's take a picture. Would you take a photo of us, please? - Get over here! - Settle in, settle in. - Are you leaving? - Yeah. See you. Fine, see you! - Are you leaving? - Yes, I am. Why? It's too early. I'm so tired. I can't stay longer. Stay just a bit longer. - Nah. - Well, see you. - Congratulations! - Bye, thanks! Bye, Dani! What's up? Girl, you're super cute. - Here you go. - Any news? - No, the shots! - No, things aren't working. - Really? - No, girl. Get over that idiot. You know? All guys are dumbasses. - So just get over him, and... - Why do you say so? Aren't things great with your guy? Yeah, everything's cool but the spark isn't there any longer. - But well. - Good luck with that. Bye. I'll leave you that to fall in love even more. Love you! Hey... Do you wanna go to the market with me? You're fucking kidding me. We should've come in the day. Girl. We'll find something open. You'll see. How long it's been since your last hookup? Hello? Was it here? - Yeah. - Yeah? Hello? - Anybody here? - Hi! Hi! The powder didn't work. The ones I bought the other day. Maybe you need something stronger. No, if it's expensive, let's go. It's not worth it. No, no, no! I want that! That's what I want. Something that'll work. Come in. Focus on him. Think of him. - Do you have a picture of him? - Yes. Is that him? Yeah. Repeat his name seven times. And draw seven cards. Daniel Andrade. Daniel Andrade. Daniel Andrade. Stand at the center of the room. The tie will work if you place it under the pillow you use to sleep. So, your head's weight will always be on him. Morning, my love. I just want to understand the first stage of the... Look, we'll start here, over the urban space. Then we'll have the Main Tower here. Here are the mixed residential towers. Yeah. This is going to be the main street. This part here, that was designed by Julieta... Hey! Sorry! Sorry, it's me. What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood and wanted to see you. May I come in? Sure, of course. Come in. Let me close it. Let me... - Do you like it? - Yes. Sorry I just have this. I haven't bought groceries and... - Hold on, listen... - I wasn't expecting company. - It's perfect. - Is it? Yeah. ♪ Whenever you ask me ♪ - Can I help you with something? - No, it's fine. ♪ How and where ♪ ♪ I always answer ♪ Do you like dancing? No, no. It's just that this song makes me... It kinda moves me. It puts me in the mood. What about you? You dance? ♪ And the days pass like that ♪ Leave that. Leave the bread. ♪ Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps ♪ ♪ You're wasting your time ♪ ♪ Thinking, thinking ♪ ♪ For goodness sake ♪ ♪ Until when? Until when? ♪ ♪ And the days pass like that ♪ ♪ And I, I am hopeless ♪ ♪ And you, you only answer ♪ ♪ Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps ♪ You're going too fast. I don't care. I'm crazy for you. Is that bad? Hello? Guess with whom I spent the night? No way! The spell worked, girl. We'll talk more at work today. - OK! - Bye! Good morning. Julieta. A word, please. Now tell me! What happened? - Nothing. We just slept together... - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Daniel told me that he liked me since he got here and didn't know how to approach me. - Hey, girls. - Hi. Say congratulations to me. - No! - Yes! What happened? Eddie surprised me, and then just... Boom, ring and everything. But weren't you going to break up with him? Yeah, I thought that's what I wanted but suddenly this happened and I'm super in love and I just wanna be with him. - How cool. - With that stone, who wouldn't? Congratulations! - Thanks! - I'll be back. - And you? - I must tell you everything! Oh, oh, what? I was looking at the idea of using different materials. I was thinking of coating the stone wall and putting some lights on the floor. What do you think? - Sounds good. - Thanks. I love it. OK. How is it going? Slow but steady. It's gonna look great. Yeah, I don't doubt it. That looks great. Hurry up with that. It's urgent. - Yes? - Julieta? Please, don't hang the phone. - Who's this? - I'm Gabriela. - Daniel's ex. - How did you get my number? Beware, he's a violent man. Listen to me, please! It wouldn't be the first time he... Why are you here? - We said... - I made dinner and everything. I think it's delicious. I rarely cook pasta. Daniel, how did you get here? You left a copy of your keys. Look. Look what I got for it. It's to die for. It's a heart-shaped keychain. Isn't it cute? Yeah, but I never gave you my key. No, but I didn't want to bother you with that. I won't bother you with the keys and stuff. I made the copy myself. It's easier. Are you hungry? Um... I'll be back. Don't take long. It's pasta. It'll get cold. Hello? Hi, Julieta? Is he there? You scared me. Daniel, you're hurting me. You're hurting me. - What are you doing? - Don't you like it? There. Easy. Easy. Girl, I'm gonna find a rich, famous, single man and I'll put a spell on him. That's the key! The key to everything. Well, hurry up. Because I don't think there are many rich and famous singles. - Girl, I'll find him! - What's up? Hey, what's up? - What are you doing here? - Hi. - Hi. - I just wanted to see you. But we were gonna meet later. Well, I finished early so I thought of catching up with you. And how did you know we were here? Well, it was just a hunch. Do you want a drink? I'm OK. I'll bring something for you both. So? I mean, I wanna find someone nice. But then I think of fidelity and it's bullshit. Being polyamory is the thing today. But with some rules, because then it becomes a mess. Well, but if you... I'm going to go and talk to her, who is she? Who is she! - Shut up, right now! - Motherfucker! What was that? You OK? Sorry, everything's OK. My ex. She's crazy. Yeah, I mean. Look. Just look at me. She's like obsessed with me and... Now she saw me and she kinda lost it. OK, so... What were you talking about? - Hey... - Yes? What did Elena say about me? Nothing. Why? I don't know. She doesn't give me good vibes. I don't know. She's weird. I don't like you guys hanging out. She's my friend. Daniel, I'm driving. Easy! Hold on. They're honking. I'm glad you liked them. I loved them. You've been... A bit more inspired. Yes, a bit. Almost there. Go on. You're doing great. What's up? I'm good. The boss loves you, doesn't he? - He's happy. - Of course, he is. I'd be the same if you touched me the way you do with him. I'm don't touch him. He touches me. You seem to love it. You're all over him all the time. - Are you serious? - Yes, I am. - I've never given any signals to Marin. - It looks like you wanna fuck him. - It's obvious. - Don't be a dumb-ass. - Don't call me a dumb-ass. - Let me go. - No, I won't let you go. - You're hurting me. - I won't look like a dumb-ass. - Everyone's looking! - Let her go! - You stay out of this! What's wrong with you? - Security! - Shut up, idiot! I'm talking to you. Look, what you've done. - Daniel! - Didn't you want to make a show? Stay out of this, dickhead! - Especially you, motherfucker! - Leo! Is this what you wanted? To make a show? - Leo! - With your mini skirt! Come on! Make a show! - Let go of me! - No! Listen to me! - Let me go! You're hurting me! - Sir, come with me. Who do you think you are, prick? - Grab his stuff. - OK, OK, I got it. Are you happy? - Are you OK? - Yes, I am. Please, open the door! Open the door, Julieta. Please, I need to tell you something! - Roll down the window. - I'll call the police! No! Listen to me! Go! Stay away from him! Julieta! - You can't be here, Daniel. - You were with Marin, didn't you? Give me your keys and leave. You're playing mad now? - If you don't leave, I'll leave. - What do you mean? First you seduce me and then what? You're playing with me? Playing hard to get? You like games? It's your fucking fault - that I lost my job! - It wasn't... You like games? No fucking way! Come! Julieta, open the fucking door! Open the door! Open the door! Why are you doing this to me! Open the door! Your family will pay for your mistakes I never liked her for you. Open the door! I'm going to do my best work with you. I will merge your destinies for him to be with you forever. You like this, right? This is on you. We'll be together my love. Forever! Girl, this is not OK. Let's call the police. It's going to be useless. Cops are going to say that it's my fault. He got mad. He lost control. I don't know. This guy is crazy. He's dangerous. Hello? Hi, is this Gabriela? Gabriela is no longer with us. There was an accident. What? Hello? Who is this? Do you have any information, please? Hello! Please, tell us anything you know? - The Sonora Market! - I'll go with you. SONORA MARKET I'm terrified! Daniel's crazy! He's a violent person. Julieta, please, calm down. Listen, we can go to my grandma's house for a couple of days. So, you can take a break. Far from this motherfucker, so he won't find you. We'll come up with something. Sounds good? Yeah. Thanks. - Hello? - Hey, Karla! - How are you? Daniel speaking. - Ah, hey. Everything OK? Yes, yes, everything's cool. Look, the thing is that I can't reach Julieta and I'm a little bit worried because of this, because I have to give her some stuff of the project we are working on. Do you happen to know where she is right now? Just to send it to her. Yes, well, kind of, I think Julieta and Elena asked for the day off and they went to Elena's grandma's house, somewhere out of town. If you want, I can send you the address by message, or I can call Julieta and tell her that you are looking for her. No, really, thanks. Don't bother. I don't want to bother any more, send me the address and I send her the stuff. - I don't want to bother anymore. - Ok, sure. - I'll send you the address in a moment. - Thanks. Lovely. - Bye. - Bye. So... Welcome to Nana's house. Where's your grandma? I don't know if in heaven or hell. Chill, girl. Enough with the long face. Make yourself at home. Chill. Yeah. Do you have wine or anything? I'll bring it. Did you lock all the doors, right? Yes, everything's locked, relax, girl. We're safe in here. I think the window over there is open. Let me check. Oh... right... Everything OK? Yeah. - Do you need any help...? - No, I'm OK. Relax. Get some sleep You need it. Yes. Elena? Elena? Come here, you bitch! Let me go! Let me go! You're disgusting! Why the fuck did you run away? You're mine. Don't you understand? Don't you? This happened because you ran away. Fuck, what do we do now? Let's call the police. - I don't think it's a good idea. - Why not? He tried to kill us. It was self-defense. I don't trust the police. Let's suppose we call them. Will they believe us? They won't believe us. What are we going to do?

It's just that I'd love to see you there. And feel your company. Even my family is super weird about it. Last week they were like... Sorry, I can't stop talking. Sorry. And, by the way, Daniel called me last night to know where you were. Is everything OK? Is everything OK? Yeah. It's done, Miss. Thanks. This part, around here, is the east view, Tower One. West view, Tower One. - Julieta. - And as you can see the changes you asked for are almost done. I'm here! We had to change the elevators' location because it was hard for residents to move from the parking lot to the apartments in Tower Two. And sometimes taking the supermarket cart is complicated. ♪ Whenever you ask me ♪ ♪ What, when, how and where ♪ ♪ I always answer ♪ ♪ Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps ♪ ♪ And the days pass like that ♪ Julieta! That's what you want, right? For everybody to see you. You want them to see you, to touch you? The dead will always follow you. Daniel, as you were saying. City authorities found a charred car next to the body of a man who was disfigured by the fire. This happened near the Ajusco hill zone. Do you want to play? The city's forensics team has roped off the zone. Investigation suggests a possible vendetta Miss, would you want something else? Kitchen is about to close. From organized crime. Back with you at the studio, we'll linger for more information. Not even the death would stop me. Death doors are always open. Never... We'll be together, forever. Forever. The end is here, your life and your death will be meaningless - Julieta... Julieta! - What have you done? Did you sleep here? What? No, no. Are you OK? Yes, I am. Wash your face or something. You want some coffee? Yes. OK. I feel like he's around all the time. It's like Daniel is still tied to me. Things move. I don't know, I feel like he wants to make it clear that he is still here. Listen. It's all in your head. Daniel is not here. He's gone. I'm here with you. And I'll always be with you. Calm down. Listen, girls. We have to deliver the project tomorrow morning. Can you stay until late? I can. Elena, can you stay with Julieta? I can't. I'm sorry. I'm having dinner with the guys from the other project. - Karla? - I can, but not all night because I did so the last week. - Sorry. - It's in your hands. Yes, I'll stay until it's ready, and I'll send the project. You look a bit tired. Can you do it? Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You can leave, girls. Julieta! I've miss you, baby. Where are you going? Hey, how's it going? Why that face? You look like you've seen a ghost. - Don't tell me I scared you. - Somebody turned off the lights. It's that fucking guard. He always does the same. I'll text him in a moment. Let's leave. Don't be scared. Julieta, calm down. Are you fucking kidding me? Look at that. I leave you alone for a moment and you're seducing the boss. Hello, my love! Julieta, Julieta... You see how you do like your boss You're mine. Hey. What happened? The boss was murdered. What? Someone tossed him inside the elevator shaft. - Where's Julieta? - I haven't seen her. Julieta! Are you there, Julieta? Julieta! Julieta? Julieta? Hello? He's not here, he's dead. Julieta? I killed you. I killed him. Please, forgive me. Julieta, are you OK? No. Please, no. Don't hurt her. Julieta? Julieta, are you OK? What happened? Marin did this to you? Julieta! Julieta! Say goodbye to your friend. Go or he'll hurt you. Julieta... Julieta, what are you talking about? No, Daniel... Do you think you can play with me? - Julieta, Daniel is dead. - Of course not, baby girl. Go away. I'll take you to the hospital. Come, let's go to the hospital. The door's locked. For God's sake, Julieta! Say something! He doesn't want me to leave. What was that? I must stay with him. Or he'll kill everyone around me. - Julieta? - Let her go, please. - I'll do anything you want. - Julieta, you're scaring me. Let's go! Let's go! We'll be together, forever, my love. - Is he here? - Together, forever. Forever. Please, no. Let her go. Please, no. I told you, I never liked her. My child. There must be a way to get rid of him. Unfortunately, we get to know people when it's too late. Yes, but he died. You made a strong tie. One that disregards the limits between the living and the dead. Please! There must be a way. Please. Please, help me? - How are you? - What are you doing here? Go on, show them! Let's do it. There's an ancient ritual. It can take you for a few minutes to the border between life and death. The man who is after you will be there. What should I do when I get there? You must cut the tie. This place looks different for everyone. Listen to me, child. As soon as you get there, you'll have everything to undo the tie. But if you don't do it, you won't be able to go back to life. And you'll be tied to him for eternity. Are you sure you want that? Yes. Give me your hand. And so, we offer a life to protect your journey to the other side. Make sure it cuts through. There's no time. Sit down. Drink. Lie down. Don't leave her. Don't forsake her. Julieta, what are you doing here, my love? Light the circle. He's here. Fire against fire. Go away! Leave this child alone! Child, be brave! Focus! Protect this child. Don't leave her. Don't abandon her. Poor little thing. Do you really thing this is going to work? Don't be scared. Come on! Hi, my love. Child, focus on him. Don't be afraid, I'm here to guide you. I asked you something. Set your own rules, that's is your own, personal world. Follow those rules and you could break the tie. Focus on him and don't be afraid. He has to go away. We'll stay together. Forever. No, no, no. Shh, hey, hey. Calm down. Are you going to stop trying to run away? Give them to me. Focus on him. Remember, you have to come back before the fire burns out. My child... The red string is unbreakable. And trying it's only going to reflect the damage over yourself. We'll live together. Stop. Don't be afraid. What did you do, my love? Remember, you are in his world. Inside his mind and he will do everything to keep you by his side. Let me play now. Don't be scared, child. There's no escape. - Don't you see? - Julieta! Julieta, come back! You must come back. Julieta, come back! Julieta, he is inside your mind. Don't let him use fear to control you. When you're awake... You want to play? When you're sleeping... Julieta! I will be forever by your side. Julieta! You don't understand, do you? There's no way out. There's always a way. You need to get out of there, Julieta. Come back. You need to get out before the fire goes off. You're running out of time. You need to come back! Do not move! We're going to be together, my love. Together, forever. Julieta? My child? Child, wake up! Please. My child. Child! Please, answer! Child! Please...! Julieta...! We're finally together. Forever. THE TIE
