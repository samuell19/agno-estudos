"There will be no sorrows anymore..." "...in the whole of India." "All the travelers are on a long voyage." "You will also face the storms and hardships." Come in, dear. Come in. There's nothing to fear. Come in, dear. Nepu, don't scare her off. You don't have a mind. She came to a new place. She is such an innocent girl. Let's leave them now. They are peeping into my room. Rascals. You might be shameless, but I am not. Now you can peep as long as you want to. Now go to hell. I heard that you are Anand Moi. Why are you so Nirananad(dull) Moi? So? What's the matter? Come here. Couldn't you hear I asked you to come here! Stop acting in front of me. I have seen many such acts. I know the women species very well. You are still standing there? I said, come here. Pretending as if you're the most novice person on earth. Oh God! So tears came out of your eyes? They are flowing... River Ganges and Jamuna... ...are flowing through your eyes. Take this. Wipe out your tears. If you don't stop it I will give you a tight slap. There you go. You're a good girl. You're a nice girl. Remove the veil. I said remove the veil completely. I want to see your face. Remove it. Don't rub me the wrong way. Mind it. When Nepha Chatterjee gets upset people can't bear it. You don't want to see me angry, do you? I want to see your divine face once. Look at me. Look at me. Look at the dot between both my eyes. I want to check if you are squint-eyed or normal. Squint-eyed people completely repel me. Look at me! No, you are not squint-eyed. I just wanted to see if mother was right. She was praising your beauty too much. I can't bear it. Honestly. But after I married you I can't leave you, can I? If I liked you or not, if you liked me or not... ...talking about these things are imperative. But yes, there are a couple of things I need to tell you. Or else later on you will say that I am fraudster, thief, liar... The thing is that we have a theatre party. I will be returning late from there everyday. I can't even tell you when I would return. Once in a while I might even return in a drunken state... I can also go to watch dance performances in brothels. I am a descendant of a royal family. That's why I am bound to have such regal pursuits. You need to overlook such minor flaws, ok? And if you nag me about these things... ...I will bash you up and kick you out of this house. It's a matter of fifty years ago. But my husband's first words on our wedding night... ...are still afresh in my ears. I feel like it happened just a few days ago. Those were different times, dear. Husbands wouldn't see their wives for long stretches... At that time a man's real home was outside his house. And we were also novice. But yes, my husband was a good person. He used to say a few things when he used to get upset... ...but he had a heart of child. When he went out to collect offerings for his troupe... "Give us your offerings." "And help some lives survive." "Give us your offerings." "And help some lives survive." "God will give you His blessings." "He will fulfill your wishes." "There will be no sorrows anymore..." "...in the whole of India." "All the travelers are on a long voyage." "Your feet also graced that land." "You will also face..." "...storms and hardships." "Give us your offerings and help some lives survive." "God will give you His blessings." "He will fulfill your wishes." That was the last time I saw him. He left with the donation money... ...for his shows. I don't like to talk about the same thing day after day. Now you go home. Let me go home and have a cup of tea. I say that I don't like to talk about the same thing day after day... ...but the truth is that I like it a lot. I am able to spend the remaining days of my life... ...only with the help of the memories of the past. "...in the whole of India." You couldn't recognize me, aunt? I am Montu. My uncle is Nepha Chatterjee. That is your dead husband. That means my father is your Padmabhushan Chakraborty. I see. You are my brother-in-law's son? Come in, son. Come in. Please don't mind, son. I couldn't recognize you. It's quite natural. We lost touch since a long time. You are right, son. If I had my own children they might've been in touch with you. Everyone would've known everyone. Sit down, son. - It's alright. - Sit down. How is your father? - No, he passed away a year ago. Oh no! What are you saying! You didn't inform me about it, son? I didn't even know that you are living here. Just one month ago I came to know that you are... ...still surviving here. I get a post-card from Vijaya once in a while. My other brother-in-law's sons. From Bhuto and Kelo. Only then do I realize that there's a world... ...outside this house. Would you like to have some tea? Only if it's not a trouble for you. No, it won't be trouble for me. I am so happy to see you here. My heart is filled with joy. God bless you, son. God bless you. May God give you a lot of happiness... Mother passed away even before father. What are you saying! Am I the only one left... Everyone has left one by one and I am still stuck here. That's the reason I came here, aunt. Why would you stay here alone when we are there? We won't let you stay here. Lotu said that... Lotu? Who's Lotu, son? - My wife, my better-half. Lotu said that it would've been our responsibility... ...to look after our parents if they were alive... ...in the same way we have a responsibility towards aunt. She asked me to come here and bring you home. That's why I came here to take you home. Where will you take me to? - Why? To our home, in Kolkatta. - To Kolkatta? To your home? I never dreamt this even in my dreams. Oh come on! You are our near one. You are family. God bless you, son. May God give you lots of happiness! God bless you. Sometimes I too feel very lonely here, son. Mostly when I am ill or something... At that time I just take lord's name and weep. I say, O lord, people don't have money and property... ...but at least they have their near and dear ones with them. Don't I have anyone? You need not stay here alone anymore. You will stay with us from now onwards. I think God sent you here, son. But what about my home, garden... And the land and the crops... You can come here whenever you feel like coming here. Kolkatta is not too far away from here. There is no need for you to leave your money here. I am an old lady. Won't I be a burden on you? You are surprising! Son. Son, once I will go to Kalighat. Definitely. Whenever you feel like going there. Once I went to Kalighat with your uncle after my wedding. He asked me to sit at the temple... ...and said that he would return in a while. When he returned after two longs hours... ...he was in a completely drunken state. Oh God! He was unable to handle himself... ...and he was trying to cover me in the crowd. Please come in, aunt. Please come in. How could we have let you stay alone in the village! It's alright, dear. It's alright. God bless you. May God fill your life with happiness! Please come. Get fresh and have some sweets... ...I made for you. - Montu, just see how concerned... ...your wife is for me. She's such a nice girl. I have got so many relatives. But there is no one who thought about this old lady. What are you saying, aunt! It's our duty. Both of us lost our parents. You will live here like our mother. You say such sweet things, daughter-in-law. You studied a lot, didn't you? No, I just managed to pass MA somehow. That too in economics, aunt. It's a tough subject. But she's very good at economics. Oh come on! Just cut that crap. Don't embarrass me. My daughter-in-law is really very sweet. But why is your face not so sweet, dear? It looks so dull. I got it. The evil government raised the prices of pulses... ...and sugar and you lost the sweetness from your face. Did you get upset, dear? I was just kidding. Why would I get upset, aunt? What you said is right. In this city people are somehow surviving... ...on medication. In your times people used... ...to have milk and curd, and good healthy food... Yes, and along with that we used to get husband's... ...slaps and kicks. You miss that as well? Today's husbands don't do that. It's said that women and men are equal. I was not in your place, or else I would've shown what I can... Montu, your wife is quite short-tempered. And here's your granddaughter Tinku. Go to your granny. - O lord! You are so strong. I thought you would be weak. Did you see how happy she looks with her granny? That's the strength of the blood ties. My lovely granddaughter. Daughter-in-law, do you have only one child or... No, actually... Actually bringing up just one child... ...is so difficult, aunt. - O God! Now what's that! How can it be called a family unless you have children! That was the mindset of your times, aunt. And today's thinking is that if you... ...can't bring up the children properly, then... Do you want to say something? Aunt, now you get fresh... - Yes, you are right. Give me the baby. Hold her. Come. Aunt, I have got a small request. You can't walk bare foot in Kolkatta. You will have to wear sandals. Sandals? What are you saying! You want me to wear sandals? Aunt, I will bring pure cotton sandals for you. God won't get upset with you, aunt. Actually the thing is that Kolkatta's street are unclean... And if your feet get infected baby might also get affected. Come, I will show you the bathroom. Get fresh. There's the tap where water comes from river Ganges. If you wish you can also take bath... ...under that tap from tomorrow onwards. The boy went for fishing to the banks of a river... Say it. - The boy went for fishing to the banks of a river... But the frog came... - But the frog came... ...and took away the fish. ...and took away the fish. Wow! Can you give me 10 paisa? Please give me 10 paisa. Chunchuni and I will eat. Who are you, son? You look like sweet little angels. She is my sister Chunchuni. We are very hungry. We didn't eat anything since morning. Honestly. O God! What are you saying! How reckless are you parents! What sort of people are they! They left you without feeding you in the morning. Take this 25 paisa. Take it. Which country did I come to! Kids are running on the streets without eating anything... ...and they are least bothered about it? - Shontu. Hey, Shontu. Shontu, stop. Shontu, stop there. Shontu, don't go. Hey, Shontu. Shontu, stop. Shontu, stop. Shontu, listen. Don't go there alone. They are more in number. - I am not scared of them. I can handle all of them alone. They are trying to show off their power in our locality? Don't be stupid. Brother Ravi said that... ...they are carrying bombs and weapons these days. Who's scared of the weapons! - Then go and die. I will tell brother Ravi about you. You know what will happen if I tell brother Ravi about it. To hell with brother Ravi! Brother Ravi! Oh God! How aggressive these kids are! Where did I came? Give me two biscuits. Where did you get the money, Tuntun? A lady gave me the money. - Did you hear his language! A 'lady' gave me? He's lucky with the ladies. Just think about the future of this country. Look at the political situation. On one side there's China and on the other side there's America... ...and in the middle we are lying helpless. No hands, no legs, just a head. Quarrelling. Hey, I gave you such pearls of wisdom. Get me half cup tea. And I have been tolerating you till now. You must also get me half cup tea for that. I shouldn't have messed with you. You have learnt to talk these days. Take it from my cup. Stop quarrelling here. You are causing me a headache. Brother Ravi... Brother Ravi, Chenu's men are showing off their power... ...in our locality. - I told Ranu that I will go there... ...and teach them a lesson, but he said that you... ...barred me from getting into fights. - Yes. Don't mess with Chenu's men empty-handed. They are carrying weapons these days. Jhontu, can you solve it or should I get up? I will teach him a quick lesson. I will kick him out of here... No, don't kick him out. Bring him to me. Nimai, Manu, go with him. Jhontu, stay here. - What? - Stay here. Why? What's wrong if I go with them? Sit here. - Sit here! As if I am the root cause of all trouble. Why are you standing here, son? Are you waiting for someone? How does it bother you, old lady! Get lost from here. Just hear his language. Hey, I am of your grandma's age. Didn't you learn how to talk to elders! I will bash you up and kick you out of here. Do you know whom you are talking to? - I know. I am talking to a child of my grandson's age... ...who unfortunately still haven't grown up. What sort of language! What sort of attitude! What's the matter? Mr. Anukul. So how come you are here? Sir, it's been a long time since we saw you. Sir, our eyes were dying to see you. When you would grace this land, when we could see you... You need not show off your teeth. - Sorry. You learnt to make fun of your father these days. No, we are making fun of you. We are just... We are welcoming you. - Yes. "Welcome. Welcome to our place." "You came here and..." Scoundrel, get up. Get up. You were showing off your power to an old lady? Beat him up. - You came here to show off your power? Scoundrel. What's going on? Why are you beating him? Why are you fighting? Hey, look at them. Open the door. Open the door and see... See what these kids are doing. Come inside. Come inside. - Look what's going on. God! They will kill each other. Beat him. They will start throwing bombs at each other in a moment. This is a regular occurrence, aunt. Don't stay out with Tinku for so long. Now you saw Kolkatta's condition. Stay here. Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi, you were right. We got these bombs and this knife from his pocket. Ravi. Ravi, please don't do anything in my stall. Please deal with him Outside... Why were you roaming with bombs and knife in this area? I do what I feel like doing. This is not your father's area, is it? I will tear your tongue apart. Do you think only you have got bombs and knives... No one else have them? Get up. Get up. Why did you come to this locality? The family that moved into 11/1. - Mr. Mohal's daughter. What do you got to do with her? Why? Is Shobita your sister that I have to tell you? Shut your mouth. So you still didn't learn the lesson. What's going on over here! Why are you fighting here? - What fight! Is there no law and order in this place? You mind your own business, sir. This is our private matter. Private matter? Nonsense! Sir. Sir, listen. Listen. Say it again what you just said. I would've offered something to the guest. Brother Ravi, he's Shobita's father. Sir. Sir. Sir. You were asking why we were fighting... That scoundrel... Look at him. He came to meet your daughter. He wants to be your son-in-law. - Indiscipline. Rascal. Beware! - Ravi. What? - Till now you didn't learn how one should talk to elders? You are on your way to office, father. You better go to the office. Don't interfere in my matter. Catch him. Catch him. Catch him. Catch him. Catch him. These kids look like angels but their behavior is so poor. Let's go. You put Tinku to bed by 11 O' clock, ok? She will sleep for a few hours and then give her... ...a glass of milk at 4 O' clock, ok? We would return by 5:30 pm. Do they give her salary? - Yes, she gets 400 rupees. Can a family survive with one salary these days, aunt? Let's go. How dare you to misbehave with me, scoundrel! Beware, you dog! If you have any affinity towards your life... ...then stay away from me. Virendra. Virendra. Where are you, Virendra? Come to my rescue. Whom shall I call for help? There's fire and danger all around. Stay away from me, you devil. God will punish you for your sin. I am bidding this world goodbye. "There honey in your voice." "Your beautiful smile..." Now there's another play. I will have to perform Chintamani's part well. Why do you play female's parts? - Why? You showed your nature. Sometimes you get on my nerves. You criticize everything. Ok, fine. I won't say anything now. Stay quiet if you want to get meals two times a day. Did you get upset? Forget it. Come closer. Female parts are difficult parts. Your make-up, your body language... ...your eye-movements, your expressions... ...managing all these things is not child's play. No one in this province can play those parts. Will you get me a sari after a good theatre project? Your father doesn't supply saris, does he? Don't bring my father into this. Did they tell you how much your salary is? - Salary? What salary? - What are you saying! They are not giving you a salary? You are working here for just two meals a day? What are you saying! Why would they pay me salary? What do I do here? - Oh! So what you are doing is not called work? You are babysitting the baby, giving her a bath... ...feeding her, putting her to bed... Isn't it called work? You are making me laugh. Do they have to pay me a salary for that? I am their aunt. He is my nephew... I see. So where was your nephew till now? And how come he is so concerned about you all of a sudden? I am unable to understand whatever you are saying. Who will look after their baby now? In today's times they have to shell out... ...at least 30 rupees for a maid excluding her food and clothes. They brought you here to save some money. If you wish I can get you a maid's job... ...with 30 rupees salary right now. They will give me money? - I told you, if you are ready... ...you can see if I can get you a job or not. If you were a few years younger then I would've... ...got you a job with 50 rupees salary. These days it's easy to give birth to kids... ...but it's very difficult to look after them. No one has sufficient time. But yes, these days people don't have more than one or two kids. That means after so long lord's words came true. Whose words? - Lord Ramakrishna's words. He used to say that after the birth of a couple of kids... ...the husband and wife become as close as siblings. Siblings? When I see them every cell in my body starts burning. After that old lady's arrival I am relieved about Tinku. But I doubt if that old lady would stick here. She will definitely stick here. We will have to handle her a bit tactfully. Just talk to her once in a while, show her a bit of concern... ...get something for her to eat and she will be in your hands. Just one month ago you brought another aunt of yours. We did all these things even then, but she didn't stay here. She was a bit smart, but this woman is from a village. There will be no problems at all. Tea and one plate chicken cutlets. Shall I say something? We shall give your aunt 10-15 rupees per month... If she gets money... - No. No. You will spoil her by giving her money. She will get habituated to the money. If we give her 15 she will want 20, then 25, then 30... ...then 40, there will be no end to it. Instead of that we can buy a radio with... ...that money on monthly installment basis. She seems to be a good person. She works hard. And also she's pretty clean. These days we can't leave the kids under these maids. They spoil them. What happened? Why are you laughing? I remembered something. - What's that? Forget it. You will get angry. - Tell me what it is. You mastered the art of trapping old ladies. Did you take Tinku out, aunt? - Yes, dear. I took her out to the nearby park. She didn't give you any trouble, did she? - No, dear. What are you saying! - You had tea? No. Now you came here, I will worship the lord for a while... ...and then have some food. Montu... - Yes. - You told me that you would take me to Kalighat. Sure. Let's go. Aunt, will it be ok if you go to Kalighat tomorrow? We were thinking of going to a movie at 9 O' clock. Ok, you can go. I will go to Kalighat some other time. No, we will not go now. We will go after arranging your meals. Take this. I brought bananas for you. Montu, your wife is a smart girl. She has an eye on everything. And yes, dear, tell me something. There were so many people, but why did you... ...think of me all of a sudden? Why did you bring me here? You are our near one, you were alone in that village... No, dear. I can't digest that. I know why you brought me here. - Sorry. It's not... - What's there to feel ashamed of! You need not feel shy in front of me. I am your near one. Does Arun Mukherjee live here? Pet name is Montu. Yes, but he is in office right now. - I know that. Everyone works in office at this hour. I am... I am his brother. And does an old widow live here? - Yes. Yes. Sister Dauni. - Will you please call her once? Come in. Sit down. I'll call her. Aunt, did you recognize me? I am Bilu... I mean Jatin. Your brother-in-law's son. It's alright. Where did you get my address from? I went to your home in village... There I came to know that you are... - Tell me what you want. Can I sit down? - Sit down. Are you married? - Yes. My wife's name is Mila. - You have kids as well. One daughter. - Your wife calls you on first name basis. Yes... She calls me Jotu. - Your wife passed MA? No. She passed BA. - She works in office, doesn't she? Yes, but how did you know all these things? Your wife Milu sent you to me. She said that your aunt... ...is living alone in a village, and that she is your near one... ...and that you must bring her home. - Yes. Yes. You said it right. Mila said... - I just said what she said. We are near ones when we need each other... ...and when we don't we are strangers. After coming to Kolkatta I came to know... ...the difference between the near ones and the strangers. Yes. That's for sure. That's for sure. You are my near one. You came to me because you were concerned about me. - Yes. How much salary will I get, son? - Sorry! Your wife and you will go to work, you will go to movies... ...you will enjoy life, and I will look after your child... ...all day long and I won't get salary for that? You are my aunt, you are our near one... - I know that, son. I know how concerned you are for me. What's the salary? 15 rupees. - 20 rupees. 20? 20... Well, 20. Then it's fine. And you will also give me clothes... I don't want to embarrass a near one by taking about it. Meals two times a day, a glass of milk at night... ...and snacks at evening. That's sufficient for me. Alright. - No, son. Don't say 'alright' so soon. First of all go home. Talk to your wife tonight. And if she agrees you can come here at this time... Don't come here on a holiday though. On a holiday the near ones of this house will be here. Can you give me 10 paisa? - 10 paisa? Why? Has your father given me 10 paisa to give you? Rascal! Chunchuni, didn't you eat anything today? Go and take four biscuits from the tea-stall on my account. Brother Ravi. Shontu and Manu went to college. They won't come now. Their college is closed. What did they go there for? - I don't know. What's the matter? Why are you shouting here? We want to know the exams date. - We want to know the exams date. One at a time. - We want to know the examination date. We didn't get any notice till now. All the colleges got the notice that exams are on 7th of March. We didn't get any notice yet. And if you want to know anything more than that, you can go to the university. Don't keep on shouting here. - We did go there. They said that notice has been sent to the college. No, I am the principal here. I would've known... ...if we got any notice. - Then you tell us what we should do. Do whatever you want to do. Go on a strike in front of the university. But don't create a scene here. - Is that so! Come with me. Send police force immediately. The students are breaking the chairs and tables here... The situation is out of our control. Send police as soon as possible. Police. Police is on their way here. What's the matter? Where will you go? Shontu, run. Shontu, they are too many in number... You run. - Shontu, don't fight with them here. Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi. We were returning from the college... ...and Chenu caught Shontu. Where did they go? - Towards Kola Bagan. They were 5-6 in number and I asked Shontu... ...not to fight them over there, I said that we should run. But he didn't listen to me. Where is Chenu? - I don't know. Where has they taken Shontu? - I said I don't know. Tell me where they are. Jhonte, stand there. Manu, you stand here. You stay there. Chenu. Hey, Chenu. I don't have a problem if you want to start the old war... ...but if you have the guts to fight me then come out. Come out and show me your guts. Will you come out or do you want me to come in? Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi, they have tied me here. Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi. - Chenu. What? If you dare to touch him again, Chenu... ...all the six bullets of this pistol will be inside your skull. No one has the guts to save you. You know once I went to jail because of you. Now I will kill you and get hanged. Anukul, let him go. Get lost, rascal. I don't like fighting anymore, Chenu. I don't like fighting. Now stop these things. Ravi. I too have a pistol. You are lucky that it's not with me today. From next time onwards keep it with you. Montu. - Yes. I wanted to talk to you. - Yes, aunt. Please sit down. Why are you standing? - No, it's alright. I am happy that daughter-in-law is also present. I want to talk straight. How much salary will you give me, son? Salary? What are you saying? - You stay quiet. She said it right. She too needs some pocket-money. Aunt, we will give you 20 rupees per month. But don't call it salary, it's for your daily expenses. Call it whatever you want to call it. But I will take it as salary. Take it. You are a nice kid. God bless you. And listen, arrange meals for me from somewhere else. I heard that the shop across the corner sells curd and rabri. Arrange curd in summer and rabri in winter. What shall I bring today? Curd or rabri? You need not bring anything today. Bring it from tomorrow. Alright. - And yes, I won't trouble you for a raise. But yes, if someone gives me a better salary... ...then it's a different matter, or else I will never leave you. And Tinku will also not have any sort of trouble. After all you are my near ones, son. Ok, I shall go and read out Ramayana for Tinku. "The eyes are in search of light." "The heart is in search of the light." "There's no light and hope near me." "The heart and soul is waiting for that ray of light." "The sky and the earth..." Don't these kids sleep at night? We should leave this locality. Where will we go? All the localities are one and the same. Only God can help this country. "The heart is in search of the light." "Thousands of butterflies are in search of the light." "The waves in the ocean are waiting for the light." "Each and every cloud is waiting for the light." "Every leaf starts smiling on the arrival of light." "The whole world is waiting for the light." "We are waiting for the light." "The sky is filled with light." "The eyes are in search of light." "The heart is in search of the light." "We are waiting for the light." "The sky is filled with light." "The eyes are in search of light." "The heart is in search of the light." The exams are postponed again, brother Ravi. I don't feel like touching the books anymore. You're eating like a dog. Don't you get food at home? Can you give me 10 paisa? - Where's your sister? She is ill. She is sleeping. Give me 10 paisa. I am very hungry. What sort of people are your parents! They let you leave the house without feeding you anything? My mother and father are not with us. - What are you saying! Where do you stay? - In that broken house. Chunchuni and I live there. - Come, son. Let me see your house. - And also see if you can... ...feed them something. His mother passed away a long time ago. And his father is in the jail. - But the neighbors... ...can look after them, can't they? - Neighbors? It seems that you are new here. - Yes, son. That's the reason you are saying so. Did Tinku have milk? - Yes, daughter-in-law. She had milk and went to bed. Who is he? - A child from the neighborhood. He doesn't have his mother or father. - What's he doing here? He was feeling very hungry. That's the reason I gave him something to eat. With whose permission did you let him enter the house? Permission? Yes, with whose permission did you let him enter the house? What if he steals something? Will you take his responsibility? Don't talk like that, daughter-in-law. Don't talk about permissions and all. I felt like bringing him here, so I brought him here. And I didn't give him your food. I gave him something to eat from my share. That's also our money. - No. That's my salary. You are getting teary-eyed and blunt. No, you are the ones who are blunt and insensitive. You are liars, you are fraudsters... You sweet-talked me and brought me here... ...for your selfish reasons. You are unethical people. You are dishonest people. You are corrupt people. Hey, get up! You need not eat here. I will come back to take my clothes and belongings. You bring people and they insult us and abandon us in this way! My responsibility is to bring people here... ...and your responsibility is to keep them here. To hell with people like you. We can't work at your home at the cost of our self-esteem. You unethical fellow. And you are showing me money. With what your uncle has left for me I can feed you all your life. You are immoral people. You are showing me money. Why did you bring me here? Did I ask you to bring me here? Where will I go now? Where will I go? Will you come to our place? Your place? Let's go. Let's go. What's the matter you are ill? Let me check your temperature. Your body temperature is not too high. I am hungry. - Oh God! How'll the kids survive in this way! Take this. Take this one rupee... Bring something to eat for today. Tomorrow when I will bring my box and belongings... Here is your box and belongings... You fought with them and left that house... So I brought your belongings. And they gave you my belongings? Yes, people don't trouble me that much. They give me whatever I request them for. So, Chunchuni... Who are you, son? - I live in this locality itself. Come, Tuntun, let's go to the market... ...and bring rice and vegetables. You cook something, so that they could eat. What do you do, son? - Me? I don't do anything. I don't do any work. I am the muscleman of this locality. I show off my muscles. I have seen you on the streets a number of times. Why don't you stay at your home, son? You can help your parents if you stay at home. I am of nobody's help, granny. Granny? I go home only twice a day, for eating and sleeping. Once in the morning and once in the evening. Come, Tuntun. Mister, take what you are getting. You won't get even that later on. Mr. Nitish, give Tuntun 200 gm rice and 200 gm pulses. Sit there. - Mister... ...how can I give you rice during this time when there is not supply? A number of people don't take their ration. Give him from their quota. It's a matter of just 200 gm. Does anyone leave their ration at this time, mister? Yes, they do, and you sell that in black. Why would I object you when you're requesting me so much! Sit down. So mister, the election is nearing. What do you think will happen? Chandu, bring two teas, and listen... ...pack some sugar as well for Mr. Ravi. Will you take a toffee? Kid, you too take it. I like toffees a lot. And mister, going by what the newspapers are writing... ...I fear there might be bloodshed during elections. I don't know. I don't understand these newspapers. Mister, you're the kingmakers. - You are flattering me? No. - Nitish. Send a tin full of kerosene. There's a feast at our place. Kerosene? - Yes, didn't you get it or do you want me to... ...light it and show you what I want. You are very rustic, mister. Ok, you may go now. I will send it. - No. If this locality's ration goes to other locality I will kill you. Mister, can you tell me which side I should take? Both of you are present here. You decide it and tell me. It would be a great favor on me. It's your problem. You solve it. So is your stomach full now? Now go to bed. - Won't you eat? No. - Why? I have got some bananas. Bananas. - Bananas? Who gave you bananas? Brother Ravi gave me bananas. - Ravi? Brother Ravi who brought your belongings here. What are you doing here in this broken house? Please come, granny. Please come. Please come. We are playing cards. Sit down. Did you finish your meals? Why did you bring fruits for me? How can you fast! And also Tuntun and Chunchuni are Brahmins. You couldn't eat with them. Wow! You are pretty smart. What did I say so funny? Why are you playing cards with money? This is called poker. We play it with money. Is that so! It's great. Yes, watch how I win. Brother Ravi, blind pass. You are losing all your money. - Let the game be over. Then you can count. Seen, 20. - What's this! You play with money? Then this is called gambling. You got it right, granny. We are gamblers. We are not good fellows, granny. We are not too famous in our locality. Everyone calls us boys of Ravi's gang. Some people call us dacoits. But that's not true, granny. We were never into thefts and robberies. I am off. But if someone comes to our locality and tries to show off... ...his power we can't stay silent, can we? Then we have use some 'small wonders'... Off! Small wonders? What small wonders? You are so old, but still you don't know about small wonders? Wait a minute. I'll show you. These are 'small wonders'. Bombs. They are homemade, with brother Ravi's formula. One bomb can knock down ten people. - At once. Keep it away. Keep it away. You are kids. You shouldn't touch them. And brother, don't you study? - Yes, of course, we do. Brother Ravi studied up to BA. Then he went to jail and his studies discontinued. What are you saying! I'm off. Let's stop it here. Now we shall chat with granny. Granny, all of them study in college. But these days studies don't take place in colleges. Students prepare for exams and exams are postponed. After a couple of postponements... ...when the exams finally take place... ...there are fights and chaos in the examination halls. I bashed up a professor last time. He was saying that we create a scene and shout... ...that the question paper is tough... ...and that we don't let the examination take place. We can't go to the college and here at home... ...parents harass us day and night with their taunts... ...as if we are responsible for everything. We are also fed up of everything. We go home twice a day to have meals... ...and after that we don't have any contact with home. Your words reminded me of an incident of my past. You said that people call you dacoits. Once I too saw a dacoit. - Is that so! What sort of dacoit, granny? Did he commit a murder? Was he caught? He was a cute guy like you. Open the door. Open the door, Mr. Nepu. Open the door. In my house? Oh God! Open the door fast. The person who entered... ...your house is an anti-social person. He's got a revolver in his hand. - Oh no! Wait a minute. I'm coming. What sort of a trouble is this! Come in. Let's check inside your house. We saw him coming here. How can he enter our house? - Not just the doors, but even... ...the iron shackles can't stop the dacoit who came here. Maruti, you stay here. Come, let's check upstairs. What are you doing outside? You heard that he's a dangerous dacoit. Go. Go to the bedroom. - Where did he disappear? And what's in that room? - It's our bedroom. Do you want to check it? - No, it's alright. I am warning all of you that he's quite a dangerous person. Be alert. What a problem! Brother, come out. Thanks for saving me. I will always remember you. Go, bring it. We packed some mudi for you. Wow! I really needed it. I didn't eat anything since last night. They are chasing me like a dog. Brother, there's a... There's a small request. Will you please show me your pistol? Who told you that I have got a pistol? I know that you people carry a pistol all the times. And these are the bullets. Ok, I will have to go now. Come, I shall show you the path. - Yes. After our mango garden there's a big open ground. From there where do you want to go? I'll be out of danger once I cross that ground. They tied this woman around my neck and ruined my life. Or else I wish I could register my name in your gang... ...and work like you people. - You need not register... ...your name in our gang to work like us... You can also work from the confines of your home. What can I do from home? - Yes, you can. First of all let our country get freedom. Then a number of things will be possible. Don't prepare meals today. I won't eat anything today. Why? Will you go to have a drink somewhere? - No. No. The brother whom police was chasing that day... ...has died today. Brother was fighting alone with the Britishers. He was shot dead. He was a native dacoit. He was also as cute as you are. He too used to talk as sweetly as you talk. He was also a bit spoilt like you. Now you guys go home. It's too late at night. Granny talks so well. Right, Manu? - Yes. Just like people talk in movies. "O my beloved one..." "Your dreams and my dreams..." "...are in the same color now." Won't you go home? I don't even know your name. - Ravi. I spend most of the nights here, granny. Chunchuni gets scared. That's the reason... I am here now. You may go. Go home, or else your parents will be worried about you. No, no one will be worried about me. What are you saying! Is that possible! Let's go, granny. Let's go back to your village... ...with Tuntun and Chunchuni. - Will you come? Let's go, dear. I have some land as well. I have two large mango gardens. I have one dog as well. I can't spend all that money alone. That's why come with me, brother. It will be really great. It's a far better place than Kolkatta. Brother, you didn't say anything? Won't you come to our village? No, that's not the thing, granny. I will come. I will have to live there itself. There's some pain hidden in your heart. Am I right? I am like your mother. You can't hide anything from me. I don't have a mother, granny. She passed away long time ago. I was four year old then. So that's the reason... I was right. That's the reason you always look dull. No, granny. That's not the reason. I don't even miss my mother. Granny, how can one simple mistake of a person... ...ruin his entire life! So you trapped a chick here? That's not the language you use for well-reputed people. Don't lecture me. Had I studied in college like you do... ...I would've also talked like you. Tell me how you got her. - She lives next-door to us. You are a pretty smart guy. You dance pretty well. You are good at many things. The exams are nearing. So I'm flattering Mother Saraswati. No matter wherever Saraswati is, She is not with you for sure. Where are you going now? My head started aching after watching your dance. I am just going out to get some fresh air. If you wish I can come with you. Do you know we are leaving Kolkatta? - When? Next month. Why? - Father is getting transferred to Nasik. Why don't you come to Nasik after your exams are over? No. - Why? What's the use? - It will make me happy. Really. I will be waiting for you. I will try. Let the exams be over first. I will find myself alone after you leave. I don't believe you. - What? That you would be alone after we leave. We moved into this place six months ago... ...but you didn't come to meet my father even once. Oh God! Your father is such an angry man. He scares the hell out of me. - Great. You are enjoying here alone in the dark? Shut up! Get lost from here. - Oh God! You are having a good time alone. Think about your friend as well. Such type of guys are your friends? No, he's not my friend in any which way. He's lying. I am his childhood friend. Won't you show some mercy towards me? Alpona. Alpona. Don't try to contact me ever again. She's not worth it, buddy. Who's that? Who are you? Stop! Don't run! What are you doing here. Sunil! Manik! He was trying to enter her bedroom. Scoundrel. He's Ravi who lives next door. Scoundrel! What is he doing here? He was knocking at she's room. You are nice guy? I will not spare you. I will teach you lesson. I will show you. Hand him over to the police. I was in prison for fifteen days. Oh God! I left my education. Father stopped speaking to me. Chenu made his gang to take revenge. I made my gang. Initially, people hated me. They taunted me. They scared now. If you are silent in this world you will be suppressed. Raise your head and walk with a swagger... ...and everyone will bow down in front of you. India's heritage, India's history, India's dharma... ...India's literature, India's music... ...and India's financial situation will have to be reincarnated... ...on the world stage. For the men and women of India... ...for the poor workers of India... ...for the farmers of India... ...for India's culture and traditions... ...for removing the sorrows of fathers and mothers of India... ...I came in front of you again. I will dedicate my life, I will sacrifice my life if required... ...to serve you all... I will dedicate my life, I will sacrifice my life if required... Ravi. - Tuntun. With your help, with your backing, with your support... ...if could be able to turn our unfortunate mother Bengal... ...into a flourishing and a prosperous... Raise your sleeve. Be a bit dramatic here. Bengal is in such a pathetic state... Who will transform it? Who will support it? Who will bring the ray of hope? I will. I'll bring that ray of hope. With my service, with my action... ...with my love I will be your voice again and say... We'll have to stop the meetings... ...of the young guys over here. And listen to me here... You are eating some nice dishes over here... ...and this kid is dying with hunger. Ravi's grandmother. Take it. What's there to feel ashamed of? You are hungry, aren't you? You don't want to stay hungry, do you? Go. God bless you, son. God bless you. Mister, give me half kg groundnuts. Use the term 'kilo', granny. Use the term 'kilo'. No one says kg these days. - How does it matter! It's one and the same. Give me the grams. Ravi wants to eat ghughni. - For whom? For Mr. Ravi? Take it. Take it. Give her 500 gm grams. - I will pay the money later on. In a couple of days Ravi will go to our village... ...and sell the harvest and bring the money, then I will pay you. As you wish, granny. As you wish. Granny, let me pack some oil as well. You will need some oil with ghughni. That would be even better, son. Give her 100 gm oil as well. Give her oil. Give oil for Mr. Ravi. 5. Blind 5. - Take this. Share it among you. Great, granny. Great. Granny, I brought some milk and snacks for you. Why do you bring something or other for me everyday? I like it. It's really great. - Great taste. One has to be very fortunate to get kids like you. Like that story... I heard these from your grandpa. How else would I know them? I am an illiterate. I am talking about that story. The child asks his mother where she got him. Mother says... Oh God! You were hidden in my heart. Granny, that's not a story. It's a poem. Ravindranath's poem. Child looks at the mother... ...and asks where you brought me from, mother? Where did you bring me from? Mother laughs on hearing that and hugs the child and says... ...you were in my heart. Really, son. When I see at your angelic faces... ...I wish I had children like you. Granny says everything so beautifully. Even the biggest orators are nothing compared to her. The ghugni's great, isn't it? Tart and spicy. Granny, please make pinyagi (onion fries) for us some time. Shut up! How do you expect a lady of her caste to touch onions? My aunt should've heard you. She would've given you an earful. It's alright. I will prepare whatever you want to eat. Three cheers for granny. "O my beloved one..." "Your dreams and my dreams..." Oh God! What's that song! Tedemede! This is hindi song. No, I don't like those songs. Your grandpa also used to sing such beautiful songs. "When your beloved one looks at you..." "...the world looks beautiful." "When your beloved one looks at you..." "...the world looks beautiful." "Love has made many people famous." "Many people famous." "You look at me and blush." "You look at me and blush." "Love has made many people famous." "Many people famous." "On these wild paths hearts just wander." "On these wild paths hearts just wander." "Flowers blossom in the garden and there's a carnival in the sky." "Waking awake all night came to an end." "Look at me, O blushing wife... ...you blush and cover your face with the veil." "Look at me, O blushing wife, you blush... ...and cover your face with the veil." "Love has made many people famous." "Many people famous." Wow! - Great. Unique, granny. - Great. Our granny is a versatile genius I swear. And yes, take me to your home some day. Introduce me to your parents once. - No, granny. There's no fun in going home. My father is always moody. And my mother's has got such a suspicious nature... As if everyone in this world is a thief. Who's that? - Is Ravi there? Ravi. Please come in, sir. Please come in. Bhanu Ghoshal. I shall go now. I need to see the kids. I have been searching you till now all over the places. I asked your father and he said that he doesn't know where you went. You will find us here at evenings. Here? No. No. Is this a place to stay? A broken house, with all the... If I return to power I will raise a new building for you over here. There you will have a library, there will be a stage... You don't mean what you say. Once you get elected you forget everything. - Yes. Last time Mr. Amol said... You need not worry at all. I will tell the police not to interfere in your matters. And see the irony, when there was a fight in the college... ...the police came and I was the first person they held. I took Mr. Amol's name... And you won't believe what he said... Don't threaten the police of these Amols. Don't associate my name with Amol. I am giving you my assurance that if the present police officer... ...says anything to you, then just seven days... Within seven days he will be transferred. "Your sorrows are mine now..." "My happiness is yours now." Rafi. - Yes, Rafi. Bring him here. Organize a big function. Give them happy moment. Create the nuisance. I will give you money. But the bird in the cage... mine... that should win! Your symbol is very apt. I am giving you a jeep. It will have tank-full petrol. And you go out for the vote-canvas. And I am giving you 500 rupees for expenses. Oh God! Does anyone give such a big amount to kids! You need not worry, sir. You'll get all the votes of this locality. And yes, everything must be done peacefully. Don't take the path of violence at any cost. Non-violence. I believe in non-violence. Ok, then, get to your work. And eat, drink... ...and be merry at the same time. Throw parties. Enjoy life. But if that scoundrel, that goon from Kola Bagan... His name is Cheno or something... Haru. Haru. What's his name? - Haru Chokroborty. Yes, he is messing with me. I will break his back. If Chenu tries to snatch my votes... ...or even if he tries to trouble us... ...then you can forget non-violence. Do whatever it takes, I will take care of the rest. Take it, granny. We earned 500 rupees today. We can't get worse, granny. We have done almost everything that is wrong. Jhonte, shall I tell granny about your girl? As if you are as pure as the holy basil. You want to ruin her name? - Don't say those things. I won't believe them. Where can we get kids like you in this world? Granny is so good at flattery. These are the leaders of our country, granny. Someone goes to the assembly, someone goes to parliament... They are the charioteers of our country. - Are they? Their words and deeds are as crooked as their faces. Once I too saw a national leader. He was going somewhere through our village's station. There was a great buzz in the village since morning. All the kids and the women of our village finished our meals... ...and went to the station that was three miles away. But when we reach there we see a small station... ...was filled with a huge crowd. A few minutes later the train reached the station. I couldn't go closer. I saw him from distance. He came to the door and raised his hand. He had a saint's radiance in his eyes. As if he came to enlighten the world. He didn't utter even a single word. After a few minutes the train left and he was gone... Who was he, granny? What was his name? Deshbandhu Sealdas. On that fateful day, in year 1942... ...when from Himayala to Kanyakumari... ...the whole country was burning in the fire of revolt... On that day I too renounced my wife and kids... ...I too fought the battle for our country's freedom... That day I too went to the jail. I suffered the atrocities meted out at us in the jail... I suffered the atrocities meted out at us... Chenu. I too bore those atrocities. Then one day India got independence. We got freedom and you are enjoying that freedom today. But the job is not done yet. We need some more sacrifices. That's why I came in front of you again. Today our country's condition is pitiable. There's chaos all around. There's injustice... ...there's poverty, there's starvation, there's hunger... That's why I want to talk with my young generation... ...stay with me, spport me. I will fullfil your wish. First of all you save yourself and then you can save us. Let's go. This fool shouldn't be contesting elections. You go home. Tuntun, let's go out. Type it. See this. My name is not visible in this poster. The name should be in big fonts. Have the posters with my picture arrived? - No. Idiot. Canvas properly, Chenu. Canvas properly. It's pretty tough this time. I feel like the public don't have any sympathy towards me. Why would they have any sympathy, sir? You forget everything once you come to power. You just become inaccessible. You just vanish. I don't belong to that group, Chenu. I don't belong to that group. I do not belong to that group. There is something called gratitude. How many times did I bail you out from police station? And in return I too work so hard for you, sir. I know. I know. But... ...the public don't have any sympathy towards me. Even if they don't have any sympathy towards you... ...you will get the votes. I will grab their scruff and get the votes. - No. No. Don't take the path of non-violence. Make the public understand me. Raise me in their eyes. Praise my virtues. Take this. Here's my charity list. Look there. This year I did charity of two lakhs. Distribute those pamphlets in every area. Every single person should read it. Tell them about my virtues. Make them understand it. The problem is that the public has started thinking now. What! What will the common man think about! What's the need for the public to think! All the scoundrels are entering politics and ruining this nation... No. Don't let them think. Don't allow them to think. We will think on their behalf. We are here. If everyone starts thinking, then there will be nothing left. I am unable to understand what you are saying, sir. That's what I want. Just keep on working without thinking too much. If you had read history... You know who dethroned the kings and emperors... The landlords. Who removed the landlords? The capitalists. Who are trying to overthrow the capitalists? We. We talk about democracy and social equality... ...and became leaders of the innocent public. Whatever comforts they used to enjoy... ...we are also enjoying the same. There is no difference. Now who is trying to dethrone us? You. The goons. Did you understand it? - No. Great. You don't need to understand anything. Just keep on working. All you need to do is follow my orders. You need not understand anything. And one more thing. I heard that there's someone called Ravi... ...in Bhanu Ghoshal party and that he is canvassing in your area. If he gives us any sort of headache... ...you need not think twice before finishing him off. There are flowers on every tree. And in every flower there are peals. And the princess of that kingdom is Muktamala. The king had so much wealth, but Muktamala wasn't happy. Two demons attack their kingdom... ...and eat the people of that kingdom one by one. What was the name of those demons? - Close your eyes. Agasur and Bagasur. Now what? - Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi, Govind is not well. Your father is calling you. Come home. He's not well. Granny. Granny, Govind is my brother. Please come, granny. Please come. Has he got high fever, son? - Yes, it seems so. She's our granny. Father, shall I call the doctor? The doctor came and prescribed the medicines. You go and take rest. I will take care of him. There's nothing to worry about. You will get well tomorrow. He is very good at studies, unlike me. He's my sweet son. He's my nice son. You too go and sleep. I will call you if I need something. Go. You will stay here alone? - I am habituated... ...to stay awake all night. And also old people... ...don't get sleep at night. Go. Go. I said go. I don't think I can work for too long now. I get tired on walking just a few steps. My eyesight is also getting worse by each passing day. I think I might lose them soon. I couldn't do anything for you. I couldn't leave anything for you. And what hurts me most is that I couldn't even... ...instill good morals and ethics in you. You are mine. No. You are mine. - Mine. Mine. - Mine. Mine. - Mine. Mine. - Mine. Mine. - Mine. Mine. - Mine. Mine. Mine! What rubbish! I said they are mine. I am not going to listen to you. They are mine. They are mine. - Mine. - Mine. - Mine. Mine. - Mine. - Mine. - Mine. Mine. - Mine. - Mine. - Mine. Mine. - Mine. - Mine. - Mine. Granny, I am feeling scared. So how are you doing, granny? What's the matter! I can't see you these days. We are busy with the elections, granny. We are roaming here and there day and night. And why don't you admit these kids in some school? They are getting spoilt at home. They are wandering outside all day long. Wait for a few more days, granny. I will arrange everything. Then I will do one thing. You all are so busy. I will visit my village once... ...and I will also take them along with me. You are missing your village, aren't you, granny? Yes, son. I feel like my broken house is calling me... ...since a few days. The elections will take place the day after tomorrow. Wait for a couple of days more. I will take you there. - You will surely come with me? You will surely come with me? All of us will come, granny. We will go there and have a whale of a time. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome, Mr. Chena. Nitish. - Yes. - There're three votes at your home, right? Yes. - All three of you go to our place at 7 am tomorrow. I will explain everything to you properly. Look, mister. Tell me clearly what you want. What do these atrocities mean! - Atrocities? Who is doing atrocities on you? - You are doing it. Just a few minutes ago Mr. Ravi came here... ...and threatened us that if we vote for your candidate... ...he won't let me run this shop in this locality. And now you came here and are threatening us. Why? What for? Don't we know whom we should vote... ...and whom we shouldn't. Don't we pay tax! Can't we make that judgment? I have to fix it. Hey, come here. Shut the shop. - What do you mean! I mean your shop will be closed... ...and you will come with me. I will leave you after you cast your vote. Come. - Do I have to come! You think there is no law and order in this country? There is law and order, but you have a young daughter. If you are not concerned about her, you can call the police. Come with me. I don't have time. Brother Ravi, Chenu has taken away Nitish forcefully... ...for his votes. Go and tell Chenu that I am coming. Tell him not to hide behind the veil. Brother Ravi, I am going to the college to inform everyone. Come, Jhonte. Granny. Granny. Brother Ravi is going for a fight... ...with sticks and all. There are many people with him. Oh God! What are you saying! What will happen now! What will happen now! Oh God! What's all this! Listen. Listen. My child is getting into a fight... Please come and save him. Please come and save him. Who would interfere in those fights, granny! - Oh God! What sort of people are you! Don't you have sympathy and compassion for others! How can this happen! Stop there. Brother Ravi. Granny. Granny. Granny. Let me go. Granny. No, I won't come. No. She's dead. Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in. Ram Singh. Get in.
