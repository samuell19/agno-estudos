Om! Every year we go to Kashmir.. ..but since last year my daughter has been insisting on going to Shimla. Are you going to Shimla for the first time? No, no, I have lived in Shimla for many years. We left Shimla and came to Mumbai.. ..when she was 2 months old. - Okay. After that we are going now. Because of her. - Okay. Because she hasn't seen Shimla. Look! One more tunnel! Mama, how many more are there? Must be a couple of them more, right? - Yes. Chandramukhi, look, there is Shimla. I have already been to this place. What nonsense are you talking? "Destiny only creates the cycle of joys and sorrows." "Destiny only creates the cycle of joys and sorrows." "It is manifested in the lines on the palms." "Destiny only creates the cycle of joys and sorrows." "Sometimes it becomes memories in adverse situations." "Sometimes it becomes the bright future in the springtime." "There is darkness in one hand and a lamp in the other." "Destiny only creates the cycle of joys and sorrows." Papa, I got ready before mama. Hey! Mama, come! Today your mummy will come out all dressed up. - Yes. Look! Didn't I tell you? - Wow! Mama is looking very beautiful! - Let us go. - Come. Dear, today we will go to Mall Road. - Okay. I met your mummy for the first time on Mall Road. - Oh! And I was charmed by her graceful walk. Oh, shut up! Oh, Sarla! - Oh, Kanta! You are here! - I come here every year. And you? I don't know after how many years I have come here. This is my husband. And this is my old friend, Kanta. - Hello. And this is my daughter Chandramukhi. - Hello. Is she the same girl who was born here? Yes, we had left Shimla when she was 2 months old. She is so beautiful! Bless you, my child! Kanta, you had a son, didn't you? Yes, Naresh. He has just returned from America.. ..after studying medicine. - Really? Why not get them to meet each other? - Sure. More than half of the weddings in Punjab.. ..are fixed on Mall Road. Sarla, where are you staying? At Sunny Cottage. Well, that cottage is near us. - Really? Yes, we are staying at Akash Niwas. Oh. - There is one thing. Tomorrow you will have tea with us. Certainly. We will go, okay? Sarla, come. How are you? - I am fine. How are you? - I am also fine. Hello, brother, how are you? - I am fine. About you? How are you? - I am fine. Naresh, come here. - I am coming, mother. This is my son, Naresh. Hello. - Bless you! How do you do, sir? - How do you do? Let us go inside. Come. Mama was right. One feels like keep on staring at you. What are you looking at? The bungalow. Yes, it is very old. Come, let us go inside. Thank you. Why did you name this house as Akash Niwas? Akash Niwas should be at some higher spot. The name of this house was not Akash Niwas. The name of this house was 'Dimple Cottage.' An Englishman used to live here. A military officer. Mr. Tom. His name was Mr. Tom. Painting was his hobby. The garden outside this house used to be full of red flowers. And there was a lone deodar tree. There used to be a rickshaw too. Tom Walters. Dimple Cottage. Have you come to this house for the first time? She has come to Shimla for the first time. We had left Shimla and gone to Mumbai.. ..when she was just two months old. Then.. Chandramukhi! By the way, the house is beautiful. Kanta, have you bought it? - No, it is rented. It belongs to Chaudhary Janak Singh. He is a very rich man of Shimla. He is as kind as he is rich. His wife has passed away. He has a daughter. He loves her very much. - Oh. I don't know why all of a sudden I am feeling sad. Papa, are you feeling all right? It's not a physical matter. My mind just feels restlessness and then it passes away. The feeling comes and then passes away. Hello, Mr. Chaudhary. Is the work in the jungle going on all right? - Yes. Don't chop more wood than permitted. - No. Okay.. Tomorrow morning, we will go early for horse riding. Okay, sir. Sir. Have the tea served. - Okay, sir. Papa, I will just be back. I wish I was as beautiful as my mother. Had your mother been alive.. ..she would have talked to you about this. About what, papa? Dear, there is no guarantee of life. Instead of.. Papa, why have you started to talk like this? Who can change the law of nature? It is my desire that your wedding gets fixed.. ..while I am still alive. That means you have got me educated to become a lawyer.. ..so that I should leave my profession.. ..and get married to someone! What if you get married to a lawyer? I mean Mohan. - Papa, he is very famous. I am an ordinary lawyer. How can I dream of winning his heart? My daughter is a precious gem. The man who marries her will be very lucky. Do you like Mohan? And there is no one better than Mohan, right? There is no one better than papa. Mohan.. ..will be coming here. Papa, why didn't you tell me before? Then how could I see the gleam in your eyes? Listen! Listen, mister! Did you say something? I have been trying to say.. I have been trying to say something.. ..but you don't listen. You keep reading book. I say.. did you recognize me? I said did you.. recognize me? Pardon me, I didn't recognize you. I am Sita. I am Sita. The heroine of Ramayan. The wife of Shri Ramchandra. Mister, did you study at Amritsar Khalsa College? Yes. So, is your name Mohan Kapoor? Yes, it is. - Now, tell my name. Pyare! - Pyare! Hey, Pyare! You know, you used to play Sita's role in 'Ramleela' (folk theatre).. ..and everybody used to tease you! You were very beautiful. - Stop it. My friend, you didn't recognize your Sita. Your moustache blocked the way. - Yes, friend. Tell me what are you doing these days? These days I am the manager of Gaiety theatre. Gaiety theatre? - Yes. Why did you leave the school? My father died. One of his friends took up the responsibility of my education. So, I had to go to Delhi. It's getting cold. - Have a drink. You carry on. Thank you, I saved on my liquor. Thank you. Well, what are you doing these days? I am a lawyer at Chandigarh. Are you a lawyer at Chandigarh? So, are you going to Shimla for the first time? - Yes. Listen, you will stay with me in Shimla. Thank you, my friend, but I'm staying.. ..at Chaudhary Janak Singh's house. Oh, my God! Chaudhary Janak Singh is a very big man. I cannot compete with him. He only got me the job. He only took up the responsibility of my education. Really? Whatever I am today is because of him. Very true, that's very true. There.. Look! There he is! Come on, hurry up! Come, give me a hug. Hello, Mr. Chaudhary. - Bless you. Karuna. Hello. - Hello. Karuna also came to receive you. Mr. Chaudhary, why did you take the trouble to come? You have come to Shimla for the first time.. ..so why can't I? - Hello, Mr. Chaudhary. Hello, hello. Pyarelal. - Pyarelal. Did you finish your work? Sir, you had helped me, how could it not be finished? Good day. Sir, I remembered one thing. The night after tomorrow, there is a programme.. ..of singer Saraswati Devi at Gaiety Theatre. Gaiety Theatre? - At half past nine. Yes, Gaiety. You all should come. Yes, Mohan will also come. Promise? - Promise. Karuna is also a lawyer. She does practice at the high court. Really? If ever I have to fight a case against her.. ..I am sure I will lose. Thanks for the praise. Karuna! - Yes? Accommodate Mohan in the guest house. He will be more comfortable there. - Come. Look, you can see the whole of Shimla. - Yes. Mall Road.. - A very beautiful place. This is the guest house. - Lovely. Mohan, I forgot to tell you of good news. You have been appointed as the public prosecutor at Shimla. What? - Papa! Congratulations. - Thanks. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. I am grateful to you that you considered me suitable for this. Welcome, my boy, welcome. Yes, I treat only mental problems or dysfunctional brains. I mean I am a psychiatrist. That means you are of no use if there is a headache or a boil. No, there are many doctors to treat that. Have you studied medicine in America? Yes. And I am getting a good job over there. I am thinking of going there after marriage. Why don't you marry a girl from that place? You can fall in love with an American girl, but can't marry her. And you can marry an Indian girl but can't fall in love with her. I laugh a lot, is there no remedy for that? Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi! What happened? What happened? - I am not feeling well. Shall we go back? - Yes. Come. "You are the messenger of Lord Ram." This is our ancestral temple and my ancestors have been.. ..venerating at this temple. This priest and his ancestors have been priests of this temple. We have a relation since many generations. Right, priest? Yes, sir. Shimla looks very beautiful from here. "You take the side of the righteous." Priest, how do Mohan and Karuna look as a couple? Very beautiful, sir. - So, fix an auspicious time for engagement.. ..and do check and match their horoscopes. As you wish. - About the predictions. Okay. Mohan, I own many of these buildings and orchards. I have no other children. Karuna likes you. If you agree to this proposal, I will be grateful to you. I will become free of a great responsibility. You have already done many favors to me. There is no hurry, think over it. Papa, shall we go? - Come. I did not feel like returning to India when I was in America. Oh. Now that I am here, I don't feel like going back to America. You get stuck on whichever place you go to. You should get yourself treated. My treatment is in your hands. In my hands? - Yes. It is said that half-baked knowledge is dangerous. Madam, now the dangerous is more fun. Mother was going to talk to your daddy. - Okay. About you and me. - Okay. I told her that first I should ask you. What do you say? So, what do you say? You didn't answer me. It's strange. - What? It feels as if this view is capturing my heart. The evenings are usually like this. Mr. Chaudhary has been very generous towards me. I consider myself to be very lucky. He always keeps praising you. And you? - I feel happy on hearing about you. Mr. Chaudhary has mentioned something, about you and me. Won't you ask me what I have decided? If you ask, then the question loses its charm. I will enjoy telling you about it. Karuna! Mohan! Aren't you ready yet? Weren't you supposed to go to some program this evening? Papa, won't you come along? Dear, these evenings are enjoyable in young age. Now it's the evening of my life. I am going to meet the governor. These are the days for you two to have fun. Listen to songs, go to the theatre. Okay? Chandramukhi. Mohan, come here. Come. Where are you taking us? - Come. Madam Saraswati, he is my childhood friend, Mohan Kapoor. In school, he used to do Ram's role, and I used to do Sita's role. Shall we go? The program is about to start. - Okay. Today's program will be different. Suddenly I feel like singing a song.. ..which I haven't sung since 30 years. "I don't know how much I love you." "But I can't live without you." "How much I love you.." "I don't know how.. ..much I love you." "But I can't live without you." "I don't know how much I love you." "But I can't live without you." "I have always been crazy for you." "I have always been crazy for you." "O darling, you have forgotten long time love." "You did not appreciate it, you didn't appreciate it." "I don't know how much I love you." "But I can't live without you." "I love you." "If anybody glances at you.." "If anybody glances at you.." "..I can't bear it, my love." "I feel jealous, I feel jealous." "I don't know how much I love you." "But I can't live without you." "I don't know how much I love you." "But I can't live without you." What happened? - He will die! Chandramukhi! - He will die! - Dear, what happened? Dear, calm down. It's okay. She must have had a dream. She got scared. It's okay, dear. Mohan! It's a beautiful morning today. Lovely morning, sir. Karuna! - Yes? Take him around Shimla. Show him our orchards. And also take him for horse riding with you. Okay. Hi, Mohan! - Oh, Pyare. Hello, Mr. Chaudhary. - Hello. Come, come. - Please come. Pyare, you look very happy. Who wouldn't feel happy on seeing the two of you together? Why so early in the morning? Are you a lawyer or a magician? You have cast such a spell on Madam Saraswati.. ..that she told me in the morning to immediately bring you to her. So we have to go to madame Saraswati's house. Come. I too will come to meet her. - Sure, come. Both of you will go together wherever you have to go. From today, I am the tourist guide of Shimla. I am your PRO. Now I have got 2 guides. Shall we go? Come. Oh. Oh, my knee! Pyare, you were taking us to madam Saraswati's house. Yes. - Does she live in this jungle? My friend, wait for a minute. I am feeling breathless. Let me perk up my mind. - Do it. Look. Look over there. - There are trees all around. Do you see that thick tree among all the trees? Can you see it? It is called Pa Ma tree. - Really? Pa Ma? - You didn't understand? You didn't understand. Come, I'll explain. Come. Can you read it? Come closer. Look. But what's so special about it? My friend, I have brought you here for your benefit only. What did you say? - It's a very old tree. Some people say that it has been there since Bheem's time. Some say that it has been there since Ravan's time. And some say that Madhav and Paro used to come here.. ..to meet when they fell in love. Actually, read carefully. Paro and Madhav. It is called Pa Ma because Pa from Paro.. ..and Ma from Madhav. You will get what you wish for. The lovers come here, stand near the tree and say.. ..O tree, shower your flowers as blessings if our love is true. Do you know why I have brought you here? - No. That day you had become nervous on coming here. I thought if there is some ghost hiding here.. ..I will bash it up. That way. I have drunk just half of the bottle. He has forgotten madam Saraswati. I haven't forgotten madam Saraswati. What a song it was! It went somewhat like this.. "But I can't live without you." "I don't know how much I love you." Stop it! Stop singing this song! How dare you sing it? We have met before. That day I had seen you at the theatre. No, before that. Some other place. Have you ever come to Chandigarh? - No. Where do you live? Mumbai. - I have never been to Mumbai. But the eyes can be deceived. But my heart says that we have met before. Chandramukhi. I'm Dr. Naresh. - Mohan Kapoor. Nice meeting you. - Pleasure. This is Karuna. - Hello. Shall we go? See you again. I am the guide! Strange! You didn't introduce me! You didn't introduce me to that beautiful girl! What's this? 'Madhav!' - Madhav! Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi! No, dear. Calm down, dear. It's okay. Enough, enough. Naresh! - Yes? Naresh, come fast. - Okay. What happened? - Chandramukhi.. What happened to her? What happened to Chandramukhi? She suddenly woke up screaming. She had a nightmare.. Did she have such a dream earlier? Last night, she had the same dream. Last night she was screaming, 'He will die! He will die!'. And today.. today she was screaming, 'Madhav! Madhav!' Son, come immediately. Go, son. - Let's go. Hurry up. - Don't worry, everything will be fine. Good morning. - Naresh has come with me. You took the trouble to come so early. It's my duty. - Please come. Hi. - It's not so bad that I'll need a doctor. But it does need a friend. What's this I hear about your dream? Yes, Naresh. For two nights I am having the same dream. But who gave you the permission to fall sick.. ..and lie in bed? Come on, get up. You and I are going to have coffee. "Forget it dear, why are you sad?" "Keep laughing, be happy." "Forget it dear, why are you sad?" "Keep laughing, be happy." "All your complaints will be over." "Keep hugging me." "Forget it dear, why are you sad?" "Keep laughing, be happy." "Forget it dear, why are you sad?" "Keep laughing, be happy." "Forget it dear, why are you sad?" "Keep laughing, be happy." "All your complaints will be over." "Keep hugging me." "Forget it dear, why are you sad?" "Keep laughing, be happy." "Look with smiling beautiful eyes.." "..how the atmosphere changes." "O darling, the face lights up like this." "Look with smiling beautiful eyes.." "..how the atmosphere changes." "O darling, the face lights up like this." "Forget it dear.. why are you sad?" "Keep laughing, be happy." "Forget it dear.. why are you sad?" "Keep laughing, be happy." "Come let us lose ourselves, let your lips smile." "Let the spring bloom in these streets." "Come let us lose ourselves, let your lips smile." "Let the spring bloom in these streets." Was it nice? - Yes. Come. Waiter, two coffees. "Forget it dear.." Do you remember you had mentioned Mr. Tom.. ..when you had come to our house? Yes. In the jungle, you suddenly became nervous. Then you stated getting terrifying dreams. And now something happens to you when you see this lawyer. What's the matter? Naresh, I don't know. Whenever I see him, I feel as if I have met him before. "All your complaints will be over." "Keep hugging me." Chandramukhi, I am worried about you. If you permit me, I can treat your mental condition. How, Naresh? By hypnotizing you. I will put you into deep sleep, but your mind will be under my control. Then you will answer correctly whatever questions I ask. So? - On getting the answer, that matter will come out.. ..which has been troubling your mind. When we find the root cause, the illness will be cured. I have no illness. - Not illness, there is some confusion.. ..in your mind, which can be solved. And when I wake you up from sleep.. ..you won't remember what you had told me. But your treatment will be within my power. Close your eyes. Lean back and relax. Completely relax your body. Do not think of anything. Now you will feel sleepy. You are falling asleep. Now you will not wake up until I wake you up. You cannot hear anything except my voice. You will answer whatever I ask. What is your name? Chandramukhi. What is your age? - 20. Now you will go back into your past life. Your age is 15 years. What is your age? - 15. What are you doing? I am with mummy. Is anyone troubling you? No. Now go further back in your life. What is your age? What is your age? What is your age? - 20. 20? What is your name? - Paro. Paro. - Paro? Where are you? - In the mansion. Where is the mansion? - In Shimla. Who is Madhav? - My fiancé. To which place he belongs? - Village Badhai. Is it your mansion? - No. my father is a gardener there. Which year is it? - 1945. 1945! 1945. Name, Paro. Age 20. Madhav is her fiancé! I think she has regressed into her past birth. Yes, doctor, it seems so. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I have never treated a patient who is troubled by past birth. Try asking some more questions. - No, no. I will have to immediately bring her back to conscious state.. ..or else it will become risky. If I fail to bring her back to consciousness.. ..she will remain insane for the rest of her life! Chandramukhi. Paro. - Yes? Paro, return to the life of Chandramukhi. You will do what I ask. You are Chandramukhi. You are Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi. Chandramukhi! Oh, God! Now..now you are waking up from sleep. Chandramukhi, wake up. Open your eyes. Oh, Naresh. I am very tired. Is something form her past birth troubling her? Yes. - What's the remedy? We will have to proceed very carefully. Keep agreeing to whatever she says. Apart from Madhav, she refers to some mansion. Here, every large bungalow is called a mansion. Didn't she tell you the name of the mansion? No. She mentions some village. Badhai village. - Yes, there is. At the foot of Shimla, there is Lord Hanuman's temple. The village behind it is Badhai village. I will call someone from the municipality.. ..and check the map of Shimla. It's possible that we can find out where the mansion is. First we will take her to the village. Her memory may refresh. She may do something on seeing something.. ..which will help in her treatment. This is Madhav's house. Listen, children, whose house is this? - We don't know. Nobody lives there. - Nobody lives there? This is Madhav's house. - Who is Madhav? Madhav died long time back. Do you remember when? I don't know. There was British rule at that time. It must have been about 25-30 years. He had a sister also. - Yes. Satto. - Yes, yes, Satto. But I don't know where she is! Whether she is alive or dead! Yesterday someone had come. She cleaned the house and went away. Who was she? - I don't know. Will she come again? She left after cleaning. Who knows she may come again.. Who can tell? Do you remember anything more? Let us go further. Who are they? - Must be taking census. And who are they? - They must be from income tax department. Let us go. - Come. Madam! It's you! Hello. I had come to take the lawyer around the orchard.. ..but you are drunk again. Now, I am surely going to complain to papa about you. Here is your salary. Madam, these days I have stopped drinking. Sir, do you drink? - No. How can I drink? Come, I will take you around the orchard. This way, this way. Hurry up, I have got my salary. Do you mean that there is no such mansion in.. ..the map of Shimla? - No, sir. Isn't there any house too? - No. Meet the bride. - Congratulations, Julie. Congratulations! Lucky Tom. - Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations to you. - Congratulations. May I kiss the bride? - Only once. No one will come forward. I have heard that your son has decided to resign from the army. Sir, nowadays I don't keep well. And it is necessary to look after the lands. Therefore.. - Hello, sir. Come, son, we were talking about you only. Father, you look tired. This may take some time. Let me escort you. - You see how my son takes care of me. Yes, yes. - Come. I suggest you go to Kashmir for your honeymoon. Yes, sir. - Fishing is wonderful. Hey, girl! Where are you going? It's all right, move back. Madam, this is for you. For me? How sweet! - Yes, sir, you were talking about Kashmir, right? But I don't think you will have much time for fishing, will you? Thank you. No, sir, I'm sure we won't. Meet me in the evening. - Well, sir, thank you very much. Well, Julie. - Happy times, Julie. How are you? - Thank you. Bye-bye. That's all, I hope. - Right, sir. Rickshaw! Rickshaw! Cheers to Tom and his beautiful bride! Cheers! Darling! Hey, Paro, it's sweet. What? - This. Who says it's sweet? Sir to madam. - What did he say? He said 'sweet' in English. It means it is sweet. This. This is not sweet. This is sweet. Liar. For you, this is sweet and for me, this is sweet. Look. Madhav. - What? Someone may see us. Wait. It's not sweet. "O dear, what magic have you cast?" "O dear, what magic have you cast?" "My crazy heart chants your name." "O dear, what magic have you cast?" "My crazy heart chants your name." "What did you do to me holding in your arms, O darling?" "O dear, what magic have you cast?" "My crazy heart chants your name." "It's not sweet." "You called me near, hugged me and changed my world." "The view is different, there are new signs, it's not the same world." "You called me near, hugged me and changed my world." "The view is different, there are new signs, it's not the same world." "What did you do to me by showing dreams, O darling?" "O dear, what magic have you cast?" "My crazy heart chants your name." "O darling, why is my heart beating so fast?" "Just like the ripples in the river, my body feels a thrill." "O darling, why is my heart beating so fast?" "Just like the ripples in the river, my body feels a thrill." "What did you do by uniting with me, O darling?" "O dear, what magic have you cast?" "My crazy heart chants your name." "What did you do to me holding in your arms, O darling?" "O dear, what magic have you cast?" "My crazy heart chants your name." Have you written this name, Madhav? - Yes. Paro, this name will keep our love alive for hundreds of years. Now you will ask me to take you to the mansion. I don't like the mansion. Madhav, I too do not like to leave you and go to the mansion. Take me away from the mansion forever. Paro, I will talk to Mr. Tom and take you away from the mansion. Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi! Oh. I apologize on behalf of Chandramukhi. She is not feeling well. Oh, I see. If you have no objection, please come to my house. I have something important to talk to you. Please. Okay. - Thank you. Let us go. Chandramukhi's mental condition is a bit delicate. She thinks that she knows you from your past birth.. ..and at that time your name was Madhav. But why can't I remember that I knew her in her past birth? Didn't I tell you that her mental condition is delicate? Please don't feel offended if she addresses you as Madhav.. ..otherwise, there is the risk of a shock to her mind. And please do tell me if she mentions a mansion. You are a doctor. Do you believe in past births? She believes in it. I do not object because I'm treating her. That is why I troubled you. Please, do come if I call you again. I will need you for the treatment. Doctor, I don't want to get involved.. ..in the illusions of some girl's mind.. ..and I don't have time to come here again and again. I am not interested in past births and I don't believe in it. But on the basis of compassion.. - Madhav! Chandramukhi, he is Mr. Mohan Kapoor.. ..not Madhav. Dr.Naresh thinks that I have a mental illness. Chandramukhi, not illness, it's some kind of confusion.. ..which will be resolved. Will you come again? - I will surely come if you call me. Will you come everyday if I call you? I laugh a lot. Mr. Mohan will come to meet us, right, Mr. Mohan? Will you come? Yes, I will come. She thinks I am Madhav. Something about past birth. Do I look like Madhav to you? What are you doing? Papa likes to have his name embroidered on handkerchiefs. J. S. - Janak Singh. Earlier, my grandma used to do this, then my mother.. ..and now I do it. It's very beautiful. - Shall I make for you as well? Well, for the time being, I will take this. No, it is said that if you gift a handkerchief to someone.. ..it causes a fight. Old beliefs. But that girl talks very affectionately. In a strange manner. Oh, I have to go and meet the priest. Will you come with me? Sure, why not? She made me promise to go there again. But it is not appropriate for me to go there. I am surprised that the doctor insists on it. He says that it is very important for me to go there.. ..for that girl's treatment. He said that? - Yes. Should I go there? You should definitely go if she is ill. Don't you believe in past birth? In childhood we are taught that there is rebirth. But after growing up and getting education.. ..that belief is shattered. Do you believe in past birth? I? Oh, hello, priest. Bless you, dear! Papa couldn't come today. - No problem. Priest. - Yes, son? Is there a past birth? Surely, there is. If there was no cycle of births, how could.. ..the Bhrigu Scrolls have turned out to be accurate? Bhrigu Scrolls. - Sage Bhrigu had written the Bhrigu Scrolls.. ..centuries ago. They refer to the lives of thousands of people.. ..those who are dead, who are alive, and those who will be born. Then there must be reference to papa and maybe about me also. Why not? - That's amazing. One day I will come to see you. Maybe there is something about me as well. - Yes, yes. Bye. - Bye. I will never be able to forget your song. Priest, papa has sent Rs. 1000 for the temple. Thank you. - Karuna! Hello. - Bless you. I will always remember your song. Hadn't I said that Karuna will also say the same thing? Blessings to both of you. On seeing you, I feel a kind of happiness. The people of the village have invited me to the fair tomorrow. Perhaps they are going to sing one of my old folk songs. I used to sing it when I was young. Why don't you come with me? "It's not the rainy season." "It's not the rainy season." "O beautiful one, tell me.. ..where did the lightning flash without the clouds?" "Where did the lightning flash without the clouds?" "You haven't seen anything yet." "You haven't seen anything yet." "Lift your gaze and look." "The lightning flashed here without the clouds." "The lightning flashed here without the clouds." "On hearing about the fair, I have come to your town." "On hearing about the fair, I have come to your town." "O dear, do me a favour, shelter me under your veil." "O dear, do me a favour, shelter me under your veil." "It might strike my heart, it might strike my heart.. ..my heart is trembling." "Where did the lightning flash without the clouds?" "Where did the lightning flash without the clouds?" "Can't you see the bright sun? Are you blind?" "Can't you see the bright sun? Are you blind?" "Crazy man, it's not lightning, it's my dazzling beauty." "Crazy man, it's not lightning, it's my dazzling beauty." "If I swayed a bit, if I swayed a bit.. ..my earrings dangled." "The lightning flashed here without the clouds." "The lightning flashed here without the clouds." "It's not the rainy season." "It's not the rainy season." "O beautiful one, tell me.." "..where did the lightning flash without the clouds?" "Without the clouds.. - The lightning flashed here." "Without the clouds.. - The lightning flashed here." Excuse me, please come with me. I think she is again having the attack. "..flashed here." Who are you searching for? The girl who came with you? Yes. - She went in that direction. In that direction? - Yes. Follow her. She will surely talk to you. This! Chandramukhi, what are you thinking? I am just wandering aimlessly. Why did you come here? Go away! No, please don't go, Mohan. Please don't go. Don't go. Look what I have brought for you. Don't you remember? - What? We had met before, at this place. That day? - Before that day. Much before. You had written this. You had given this to me. Come with me. - Where? Where we had met. Do you remember, I was waiting for you? Madhav! Madhav! For me? - No, I will wear it. Look, what's written on it? What? Madhav. Paro. Madhav. Paro. Madhav! - What? Won't you ever ask? - What? How much I love you? How much? From one end of the sky to the other end. Even beyond that. This much. And how much do you love me? Tell me! Paro, I don't know how much I love you. "But I cannot live without you." "I don't know how much.. ..I love you." "But I can't live without you." "I don't know how much I love you." "But I can't live without you." "How much I love you.." "I have heard that people carry the pain of separation." "God knows how they pass their lives?" "To me one day passes like a year." "I don't know how long I can wait for you." "But I can't live without you." "How much I love you.." "If anybody glances at you, I feel jealous." "Then with great difficulty I control myself." "How would you know what all I do?" "I don't know how restless my heart is." "But I can't live without you." "I don't know how much I love you." "But I can't live without you." "How much I love you.." Take out your knife. - Why? Take this. - Cut. Shall I cut your hair? Cut it! Madhav. Paro. What are you doing? This tree will keep us alive for 100 years. This earth will keep us alive forever. Do you remember anything? I can clearly see, you are Madhav. I am Paro. Don't you remember? Mohan, we can't believe it, but we can't deny it also. What is it? - The symbol of our love. Madhav. Paro. - When will you realize it? Will you realize it after I die? Or will you realize it in some other birth? Chandramukhi, don't think that way. Am I trying to misguide you? Don't you believe me? I believe. I do believe it when I am with you. Then please always stay with me. Always believe me. Mohan, how could you live without me for so long? I don't know how I could live. Mohan, do you love me? - Yes, yes, I do. Chandramukhi, I love you, I love you very much. I have loved you since I don't know when. I love you more than my life. Madhav, take me away from the mansion forever. Mansion? Where is the mansion? Chandramukhi, where is the mansion? Tell me! Tell me! I don't know! I don't know anything! I don't remember anything! I don't remember anything! Mohan, I can't remember anything. What happens to you? Did Mohan talk to you about engagement? Not yet. - What objection can he have? We will have a party next Sunday.. ..and we will announce the engagement at that time. But papa, give him a chance to speak. What more can he wish for in life? And it is enough for me that my daughter loves him. This engagement cannot take place. Suddenly my life has changed and I.. I have become helpless. Chandramukhi? - Yes. And you believed in her past birth? Yes, she talked as if she was trying to remind me of something. There was a kind of lightning flash, a curtain was raised.. ..some fog was cleared.. I just believed it. She is very lucky. Karuna, if ever I can be of help to you in my life.. ..I will consider it my good luck. Just.. just forgive me for this mistake. Leave it, forget it. God hasn't given me good luck.. ..but He has given me a generous heart. I have a request. Tell me. Do bring Chandramukhi to our party. I will personally announce your engagement with her.. ..in front of everybody. No, no! I can't do that. It's not possible. Mohan, give me that much right. Let me share your happiness. Promise? It will be as I wish! How did Mohan dare to refuse? It's impossible to not have this engagement. Tell the secretary that I have summoned Mohan. Papa, he has not refused. - So, did you commit a mistake? Did you two have a fight? No. So why can't this wedding take place? I want to know. I want an answer. Papa, this wedding cannot take place. Papa, don't I have a right to my life.. You don't have right to even raise your voice! You should be aware that whatever I do.. ..will be for the well-being of my daughter. Dunichand! - Yes, sir! Send invitations to all the officers and aristocrats.. ..for next Sunday's party. I will announce Karuna's engagement at the party. Okay, sir. Sir, what have you decided about your son? He has studied law and he is grown up. Get him married. What do you say? So you were in Chandigarh in those days. - Yes. - 'Lila!' Will Chandramukhi be coming? Welcome, Judge, welcome. You made me wait a lot. Sister-in-law, congratulations! He has become Sessions Judge. Thank you Mr. Chaudhary. Okay. You must be tired coming all the way. This mansion is quite far. Mohan, look after him. Accountant! Accountant! - Hello, Mohan, how are you? Come here. - How are you? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes? - Mohan, come here. Accountant, ask people to become quiet. I want to make an announcement. - Okay. Hurry up. Gentlemen! "The party has gathered just like that." "The party has gathered just like that." "Let it be colorful." "The party has gathered just like that." "Let it be colourful." "Let one lamp be put off, let one lamp be lit." "The party has gathered just like that." "Let it be colourful." "Let one lamp be put off, let one lamp be lit." "The party has gathered just like that." "Let it be colourful." "If I feel like it, I will sing a song." "This is celebration of love, let us do it in style." "If I feel like it, I will sing a song." "This is celebration of love, let us do it in style." "Let this desirable evening stretch till morning." "The party has gathered just like that." "Let it be colorful." "Let one lamp be put off, let one lamp be lit." "The party has gathered just like that." "Let it be colourful." She hasn't come. - She will. Naresh, how do I look? Today, there will be massacre in that party.. that is how you look. I am feeling a bit nervous. What's the reason? "Now my eyes look upwards as if in prayer." "My heartbeats create a song of love." "Now my eyes look upwards as if in prayer." "My heartbeats create a song of love." "Let the desires of the heart be fulfilled." "The party has gathered just like that." "Let it be colourful." "Let one lamp be put off, let one lamp be lit." "The party has gathered just like that." "Let it be colourful." Hello! You are late. We are waiting for you since long time. Please come. I'll introduce you to my papa. She is Chandramhkhi. And he is my papa. Ill-mannered! Despicable! Who is that girl? Mohan is going to marry her. What did you say? Mohan is going to marry her. Why did you hide this matter until now? Chandramhkhi! Chandramhkhi! What happened, Chandramhkhi? Coffee. Chandramhkhi, what happened? I don't know. Coffee? - No. Chandramhkhi, remember it! Remember! Tell something. Why were you terrified in this manner? What happened? I don't know. She needs rest. If she says something, we'll know something about this mystery. Then her treatment will become easy. Hypnotise her once again. Put her in a deep sleep. Perhaps she will be able to tell something in that condition. There is a danger if I do that. - What danger? She'll go back to her past life. And perhaps I won't be able to bring her back. But we have no alternative. What if she becomes mad? Even now she is getting mad. I can't take this risk. You must try. She is your love.. Don't talk about love. She loves you! Then it is my responsibility. I'll take permission from her parents. But you must say yes. Say yes. Okay. But this is the last time. Chandramhkhi, you're in a deep sleep. You are going back to your past life when you were Paro. Now you're Paro. Answer any question that I ask you. What is the connection of whatever that.. ..happened last night with your life? I'm with Madhav. Now I'll very soon take you away from the mansion. You are telling lies. Madhav. I'll marry you and take you with me. When? Very soon. Master told me, take rupees 200 and get married. Master is a nice man. Madhav, whenever I'll see the sunset.. ..I'll remember what you are saying now. Paro, now I always see you as a bride. All the time. I'm feeling very restless. It is difficult to stay till our wedding night. Very difficult indeed. Madhav, I too will now see myself as your bride. All the time. It is going to rain now. Come on. Oh! listen! 'I don't know how much I love you.' What next, Madhav? We are going to get married now. It is so much fun. Oh! - Papa! Don't you feel ashamed? You may roam about as much as you want after marriage. Get lost. What are you looking at? Get lost. Why did you take so long? The senior master is unwell. He is asleep. And listen, the junior master will come late today. - Okay. Go and put wood in the fireplace in his room soon. Let me first change my clothes. They are wet. You can change your clothes later. I'm coming back from village. You go soon and do all the work. Paro, light the big fire. It is a very severe cold. Okay. 'I don't know how much I love you.' 'But I can't live without you.' 'Paro, now I always see you as a bride. All the time.' 'I'm feeling very restless.' 'It is difficult to stay till our wedding night.' 'Very difficult indeed.' 'Madhav, I too will now see myself as your bride.' 'All the time.' 'Wow! You are looking so lovely.' 'I'll make you my queen.' 'Look, I've built this mansion for you.' 'All this is for you.' 'All this is for me. And I'm for you, Madhav.' 'Look there, a bed is decorated here for you and me. Yes!' Madhav, come to me. Paro, come here. Junior master will come soon. The dinner is delayed. The rain has stopped. Sister Satto! Sister Satto! Sister Satto. She is lost in the mansion. Chandramukhi, where is this mansion? I don't know. Chandramukhi, who is the junior master? I don't know anything. Mohan, the villagers were saying that somebody.. ..had come to Madhav's house. She will come once again. We'll find out all about it. I'll find out about it. - No, Mohan. Don't go leaving me alone. I'll come back soon. No. Please, stay with me. I'll go. Greetings. Can you tell me who Satto is? Where she is? Satto is standing before you. Yes, tell me. It is my childhood name. I'm doctor Naresh. I'm here with a strange request. Tell me. One of my patient is in very critical condition. I want your help. My help? - Yes, I'll be grateful to you. We have to go only up to Shimla. No problem. I too have to go to Shimla. But I don't understand as to what.. I'll explain everything to you on the way. Let's go. - Please come. Paro! Paro! What happened? Why are you crying in this manner? Tell me, what happened? I'm very worried. Tell me, what happened? Sister Satto. Junior master.. in the mansion.. What happened? Did he hit you? My modesty.. He has dishonored me. Paro! No, Paro. Please don't tell this to Madhav. He'll suffer. Madhav! Are you going to kill her? Madhav, come to your senses. What madness is this? No, Madhav! Madhav! Madhav! Madhav! Madhav! Are you going to kill her? Yes, I'll kill her. Or I'll kill myself. I'll kill myself. Or I'll kill him! I'll kill the junior master. Madhav! Madhav! Madhav! No! - Paro! Please come. Do you know where this mansion is? Everything can be found out from there. I don't know. Paro's father worked as a porter. I know only this much. What happened to Paro? I don't know even that. After Madhav's death, I had left Shimla. How can I find out? Bhrigu Maharaj. I had gone to him. Who is he? I know. What did he tell you? When Madhav gets reborn, he'll meet you. You met him? Yes. You met me. I have complete faith. You are a doctor, you won't believe it. You are an advocate, perhaps you too won't believe it. You both are well-educated, right? But I'm illiterate. And I believe it completely. Look, even if you have no faith, still come with me just once. Right now. One more question. Who is the junior master? Chaudhary Janak Singh. No. And this girl about whom this question is being asked.. ..her name starts with Cha. Chandramukhi! Those who ask the question.. their name.. ..will start with Ma and Sa. Mohan, Satto. The one whose name starts with Ma.. ..was Sa's brother in the previous birth. When this question is asked the girl whose name.. ..starts with Cha would be in great turmoil. Because she is the same soul who is reborn.. ..who had name starting with Pa in the previous birth. Yes, Paro. She was murdered in the previous birth. So, she will suffer in this birth until.. ..her murderer is punished. Punishment. - Priest.. - Not now. The one who loved her in the previous birth.. ..will get him punished and whose name starts.. ..with Ma in this birth. - Mohan. And one who is connected with law. He is an advocate. Who will I get punished? The destiny will punish through you. But who is to be punished? Who murdered Paro? I'll read further. Now it is being described as to who carried out her murder. The page is torn. So how can I find out? I can only read from the book of Bhrigu Maharaj. I can't tell you anything more than this. Can I call you Madhav? Once? Madhav! My brother. "The procession of misery in my heart." "The funeral pyre of grief in my eyes." "All the desire is lost from the heart." "The wind of grief is blowing." "It sleeps comfortably in the chest of storm." "Every garland of the happiness-sorrow." "It is formed by the destiny." "In the lines of the hands." "It wakes up and lies dormant." "Every garland of the happiness-sorrow." "It is formed by the destiny." Have you forgotten even to greet me? Don't live with an illusion that Chaudhary Janak Singh.. ..is standing before you to complain about his.. ..daughter's broken heart. I'm only here to ask you what do you want to say.. ..about the drama that occurred in the gathering that night. Why don't you say anything? I'm helpless. The other name for helplessness is cowardice. One more name is silence. So, I'm silent. One mad girl has blinded your eyes. Let there be curtain on the thing which is under cover. This cover is not a coffin which cannot be opened. But I can see that you're getting buried in madness. You've made a very big mistake, Mohan. When you come back on the right path.. ..that path will take you straight to my doors. But for the time being my path goes out of this house. If you need anything, you can take it from here. No request gets refused here. Naresh was saying it is very necessary to find.. ..the address of the mansion. Now I've found you, why should I bother about the mansion? Try to remember. I don't remember anything. Let's go. There! What? The mansion. Is this the one? - Yes. The bedroom was upstairs. On top of it was a store-room. But that mansion was new. Papa used to sit there. Papa! Papa! Who? Paro! Paro? Paro! - Papa. My daughter! Paro, I knew that you'd come one day. One day you would certainly come. You have come. People told me lies that my daughter is dead. No. - I had the faith that you'd be back. You'd surely come. Papa! I'm here. Naresh! Doctor is inside checking up a patient. I don't understand what this matter is. Where has she gone? Paro! Listen! What do you do here? I'm the gardener, sir. But who are you? Where is the girl who had come here now? I don't know I'm blind. I'm asking you the same. Mohan, you enquire with him, I'll go inside and see. How is Paro related to you? She is my daughter, sir. Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi! What happened, Chandramukhi? Chandramukhi! Take me back home. So you had lodged a report? - Yes. Date? It was the monsoon season. It was month of August. Date was 20. Which year? 1945. 1945.. Naresh! Take Chandramukhi home. I'll come there soon. Sir. Sir! You should've called me, sir.. Good morning, sir. I want the register of 1945. Quickly! I'm in a hurry. - Yes, sir. Constable! - Yes, sir. Take out the register from inside. Immediately. 42. 43. 44. 45. March! July! They all look torn, sir. August! 10th August. 12.. 20 August. This is the report which I wanted. The same. But only thing written is that Paro is missing. The search is going on. The enquiry and search is going on. The search is stopped. The case is closed. No reason is given. Signed by Jagatram. Where can I meet him? This constable is from British times. Perhaps he would know. Bholaram! Come here. Do you remember Jagatram working here in 1945? Yes, now I remember. He had begun to drink a lot. He also used to come on duty drunk. So the government dismissed him. Where can I find him? He was from village Badhai. Perhaps you'll find him there. May I help you, sir? Can you tell me where is Jagatram's house? - Who? The one who was in the police department? Jagat? - Yes. I'll show you. He stays in that small house. Okay. Are you Jagatram? This is Jagatram. Advocate! Do you recognize me? Greetings. Jagatram! - Yes. I want to ask you about certain things. Sir, my mouth is dry. How can I talk? Will you have a drink? - No. But you can give me a drink. It is the same thing. The shop is apposite here. Please come soon. Advocate is a nice person. He'll bring 2-3 bottles. I'll drink 2 bottles. And I'll talk. Give me two bottles. - Which brand? Any. Quickly. Take the change. Now you can talk to me. Jagat.. - Wait. Wait. Let me light a lamp first. The matter is about long time back. How long? I mean to say it is very old matter. Old matter? - Yes. Wait. Wait, I'll listen now. - Why? When I drink, all the old matters come before me. When I drink my past life comes before me. You turned out to be better than me. Drink some more. The past life has is present here now. Jagat! - Yes. I'm Madhav. Oh! Madhav! Madhav? Oh, you are Madhav? - Madhav. You are Madhav? - Madhav! So strange. Wait. Yes, Madhav! Jagat! - So you're here? Jagat, do you recognize me? I didn't recognize you. First put this inside or I'll lock you up. Put it inside? Here. Are you enjoying it? Paro! Paro? - Hey, do you love her? She is in the control of junior master. No. - Yes. This is a lie. It is not a lie. - Where is Paro? She is.. - Dead? Dead. She is dead. - Yes, she is dead. How did she die? She was murdered. Who murdered her? Who? Him. - Who? Junior master. Junior master? Drink it. How do you know? I know it well. Evidence! I've the evidence too. I'm not telling any lies. I've the evidence. If you have the evidence, tell me. I'll show you right now. - Yes, show me. Hold me. I'm falling. Why did you stop the police enquiry? I'll show you. Had you taken a bribe? Had you taken a bribe? I had. Where is it? What did you find in the mansion? What did you find? - I'll tell you soon. Here. This thing. Madhav! Paro! Madhav! Madhav! If you have got the evidence and Paro was murdered.. ..by Chaudhary Janak Singh, then you must.. ..file a murder case against him. I can't do it. It is your duty. I know what my duty is and I also know that case should be filed. But I can't do it. Shouldn't he get the punishment for the murder? My life is burdened under the favours done by him. He raised me, educated me, made me an advocate.. He made me the public prosecutor. He was ready to marry his daughter to me. But I couldn't accept her. I should file a case against such a person? You are the public prosecutor. But I'm also a human being. I've a heart I'm my chest. There is something called loyalty. Should I forget shame, honor, respect and loyalty.. ..all these things? Should I be betrayer? A traitor? Then where can I hide my face? What respect I'll be left with? Mohan! Mohan, I love Chandramukhi so much.. ..that even if I've to give my life for her sake.. ..I'll sacrifice it at once. It is my misfortune that she loves you. And it is her misfortune that you love only your honor. Come, my boy. It's good that you have returned. Well, who doesn't commit mistakes in young age? What's the big deal if you committed it? I am sure that Karuna will forgive you.. ..and she will accept you. I am also aware that you're feeling very shameful.. ..but cannot put it into words. Won't you have a seat? Bless you. Whatever I have achieved is because of your help. I am grateful. So, I touched your feet. I know that you are not ungrateful. I have forgotten whatever you have done. Have you also forgotten what had happened 30 years ago? Paro, an innocent village girl. Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten that you had raped her? Who has misinformed you? Have you forgotten that you murdered her? Out of respect for you, I am keeping quiet.. ..but you keep talking nonsense! A case for murder is being filed against you. A case for murder? Against Chaudhary Janak Singh? Who will file it? Public prosecutor. I cannot forget a favor, I will not forget an insult as well. You! Ungrateful! - It is not advisable.. ..to raise a hand on the public prosecutor, Mr. Chaudhary. You scoundrel! You survived on my crumbs and now you accuse me! Papa, what happened? He had come to falsely accuse me. And then, Your Honour, just like a falcon overpowers a sparrow.. ..in the same manner, the accused overpowered the daughter.. ..of his gardener, and satiated his lust with her body. He raped the innocent girl. And when Paro became pregnant, the accused.. ..arrogant with his youth, the spoiled son of a rich father.. ..committed another crime to hide the first crime.. ..and he murdered his gardener's daughter. Her dead body was disposed off so cleverly.. ..that for years, the crime never came to light. Your Honour, today I will expose that secret.. ..and present the crime like a fresh wound to the court. I know very well that the accused person.. ..is as very prominent man of this city. But, the law considers the crime and not the man. Before it, the king and the pauper, the rich and the poor.. ..the boss and the servant are equal. The crime is serious, the punishment is also severe. The crime is murder, the punishment is death. The law happens to be devoid of mercy.. ..therefore there is no scope for mercy. Thank you, your Honour. If a criminal wants to say something he is given chance to speak. Your Honour whom we thought to be our son.. ..if he wants to give me death sentence.. ..I've no other option but to remain quiet. Is there a lawyer to defend the accused? Mother, I will bring back papa honorably discharged. I take that oath. Place your hand on the Holy Bible and swear to tell the truth. I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth. Your name? Tom. S. Walters. Profession? - Retired Major, Indian Army. Major Tom Walters, do you know this painting? Yes, I had made this painting. It has been about 30-35 years. Who is it? I had a servant, his name was Madhav.. my God! Answer my question, who is it? He had a fiancée. This is her painting. Do you remember her name? Her name was.. Paro. I have no further questions. You may question him if you wish. Your Honor, I have no questions. Surprising! She didn't ask him anything! It's surprising. - I too am surprised. There has to be a cross-examination. - Yes. Do you recognize the necklace in this painting? My brother Madhav had gifted this necklace to Paro. Is this the same necklace? Yes, it is the same necklace. Paro-Madhav is written on it. Your Honour, look, the necklace in the painting.. ..and this one are the same. Exactly the same. No further questions. Your witness. No questions. The second witness was also not questioned. Consider Chaudhary Janak Singh as gone. - Right. What was your daughter doing when you saw her for the last time? She had gone to the mansion. Who else was in the mansion at that time? The senior master and the junior master. Where was the senior master? He was downstairs in the glass covered veranda. And the junior master? He must be somewhere inside, how would I know? Then what happened? Then.. then the junior master took the senior master in a rickshaw.. ..to the bus station. Did Paro come out? Paro did not come. You must have filed a report at the police station. Yes. Your Honour, this is the complaint book of the police station. 1945 AD, when everything used to be written in Urdu. The complaint was registered on 20th August. For many days, it was reported that the investigation is going on. All of a sudden, the investigation was stopped. Signature is of sub-inspector Jagatram. Your Honour, why was the investigation stopped? There is a secret, which will be revealed to the court. No, Jagdu, today I have come to ask you for something. Satto, what do I have except this junk? You have broken your oath to come here.. ..and I swear that whatever I have is yours. Firstly, give up alcohol. Okay. - And secondly, the paper of police report.. It is there, it is there. It is there. - Present it to the court. At which court? I will do as you say. I will tell you everything. But Jagdu, give me one promise. I spent my whole life in your memory, what more do you want? What more do you want? Jagdu, I.. I will never forget this favour. Never. This is the report which I had written after searching the mansion. It has the signature of junior sir. I had torn it from the report book and kept it with me. Place your hand on Gita (Holy Book) and swear to tell the truth. I swear on the Gita that I will tell the truth.. ..and nothing but the truth. Name? - Jagdu.. no, no, Jagatram. Profession? - Guard at the orchard. - Whose orchard? Of Chaudhary Janak Singh. What were you doing earlier? Earlier? You are a policeman, right? I was in the police force. Order! Jagatram, when you were in the police force did you ever write.. ..a missing person's report about a girl named Paro? Report? Yes, I had written it. During the investigation, did you search the house of Mr. Chaudhary? I did. What did you find? A necklace. Is this the same necklace? Yes. Yes, it is. It is the same one. From the daily report of the police, it seems that.. ..you suddenly stopped the investigation.. ..about Paro's missing. Jagatram, why did you do that? Why did you stop the investigation? Your Honour, the witness is drunk, I apologize for that. I request to the court that he should be called again tomorrow.. ..because he is a very important and crucial witness. And I take full responsibility for his remaining sober. Your Honour, I want to have a chance to question the witness. But the witness is drunk. I have a doubt that this man is faking it. Your Honour, the witness does not smell of alcohol. A charade is being played, because the witness.. ..is not answering the way the public prosecutor wants. But I find him totally drunk. You can ask questions if the witness is not drunk. Thank you, Your Honour. Jagatram! Are you listening, Jagatram? Were you sacked from the police force? Yes, madam. Why were you sacked? What do I say? Alcohol.. Because you used to remain drunk? What rubbish! Jagatram, you are not drunk! Today I didn't drink alcohol, I drank poison. Order! There is no pulse, sir. Due to this sad incident, the court is adjourned till tomorrow. The wretched man had to die today! The whole case has been turned around. What is written in the note that he had handed to you? I had promised to come to the court, so I have come. But how can I betray the one who has supported me? I had promised that I will not drink, so I did not drink today. I have come to see you for the last time. I have torn up the evidence. Forgive me, Satto. Your Honour, due to the death of the prosecution witness.. ..his testimony could not be recorded. Therefore, I should be granted some time.. ..to gather evidence and find witnesses. Your Honour, instead of granting more time to the public prosecutor.. ..I should be given a chance to present my witnesses. Are your witnesses present? They certainly are, Your Honour. Call them. My first witness is, Mr. Mohan Kapoor. Do you mean the public prosecutor? Yes, Your Honour. Your Honour, this cannot be done! This is a very strange request. But it is not against the law. I strongly protest against her request! The court would like to know if this is crucial for the proceedings. It is very crucial, Your Honour, I assure you. The court instructs the public prosecutor.. ..to take the witness stand. Place your hand on Gita and swear to tell the truth. I will tell the truth and nothing about the truth. Did you go to meet the priest of the Hanuman temple? I did. Did you go to inquire about Chandramukhi's past birth.. ..through Bhrigu Scrolls? Yes. - What did you find there? Your Honour, this is a totally private matter! Is your question connected with the case? A strange connection, Your Honour. A close connection, a dangerous connection! In fact, this case is connected with this matter. Permission granted. Thank you, Your Honour. I am waiting for an answer. What did you find out through the Bhrigu Scrolls? I will change the question. What did you find out about the past birth? I seek permission to come out of the witness stand.. ..and say something! - You will stand there.. ..until I give you permission to come down! I warn you to bring up only those issues.. ..which are connected with the case. I will be very careful, Your Honor. I will again change the question. Did Bhrigu say that Paro has been reborn as Chandramukhi? And that Saraswati's brother Madhav has been born.. ..as the present Mohan Kapoor? Your Honour, I will again request that this question is.. Is it true? Yes or no? Yes. Did Bhrigu reveal that Madhav loved Paro? And that Madhav will have to be born as Mohan Kapoor.. ..and avenge Paro's death or else Chandramukhi's soul.. ..will never find peace in this birth? Was it also written in the Bhrigu Scrolls that Chaudhary Janak Singh.. ..has murdered Paro? I don't know. Was it written or not? Yes or no? That page was torn. You may go. So, this is the situation, Your Honour. This case has been filed based on past birth.. ..and it should be dismissed immediately.. ..because nowhere is it written in the law that there is past birth. It is also not written in the law that there is no past birth! The law is silent on this matter. Silence cannot be taken as denial. The matter is very complicated. Let me remind you, Your Honour, that in this court.. ..I was put under oath of Gita. And a man who takes oath on Gita, swears by rebirth.. ..because the Lord has said so in Gita. If the court accepts the oath on Gita then it also accepts rebirth! If the court accepts the vow taken on holy Gita.. ..then it accepts re-birth too. But, Your Honour..the argument is not about rebirth.. ..but in fact it is about whether the case will proceed.. ..based on the incident of past birth.. ..or according to the currently prevailing law? Will the dead body of Paro, who died 30 years ago.. ..come to the court and say who killed her? Why would the dead body come, Your Honour.. ..when the message of her soul has already reached us? In the form of Chandramukhi? - Yes! Then, Your Honour, let Chandramukhi be presented as witness. No, Your Honour! Chandramukhi's condition is not fit enough.. ..to present her in the court! Does she have fever? - No. Is she physically handicapped? - No! Is she so delicate that the atmosphere of.. ..the court will hurt her? No! - So why can't she come? No, no, Your Honor! According to the doctor.. ..her mental condition is very delicate! Your Honour, I want to call her here to prove that only. I consider Chandramukhi's testimony very important. If some secrets can be revealed through Chandramukhi.. ..then issue summons to her. I had told you! I had told you not to present Chandramukhi in the court! The matter was not under my control. You know very well that Chandramukhi's.. ..condition is not good! Chandramukhi, don't feel scared. I have heard that you remember things from your past birth. Is it true? Sometimes I remember, and sometimes I don't. Because of this, has it ever happened that.. ..someone has thought that you are insane? Mummy and daddy think so. Chandramukhi, do you know that in the jungle near Shimla.. ..there is a big tree, on which the names of Paro.. ..and Madhav have been carved? Yes. And that they were lovers? - Yes. And currently also lovers go there and pray that.. ..their love also should be like that of Paro and Madhav? - Yes. And some also start thinking that they are Paro and Madhav. Yes. Did you go to that jungle with Mr. Mohan? - Yes. And because you love Mr. Mohan, in the passion of love.. ..you thought that you're Paro and he is Madhav. I firmly believe that I was Paro! Is Dr. Naresh treating you? - Yes. For which illness is he treating you? He thinks that there is some confusion in my mind. How were you killed? - I? I mean Paro. Was the head cut off with an axe? Was she shot? Was a knife stuck in her stomach? Objection, Your Honour! I don't know! Do you know that a man, this man is being sent to the gallows.. ..just because of you? - Because of me?! Mr. Mohan has accused him of murder, don't you now that? I don't know! - The whole world knows, yet you don't know? Your Honour, the truth is being presented in a twisted manner! I don't know! Your Honour, please tell him that he will be given a chance.. ..to ask questions, he should keep quiet. You will be given a chance. Continue with your questions. Chandramukhi, your parents think you are insane. Dr.Naresh thinks you are insane. Do you also sometimes consider yourself to be insane? No, no! - Objection! I am not insane! - I say that you are insane! No, I am not insane! Chandramukhi, you are totally insane! Your Honour! - No, I am not insane! Your Honour, please stop her! I am amazed! How is she allowed to do such a thing? She is crossing the limit! If you continue like this, the cross-examination will be stopped. I am not insane! I am not insane! I have no further questions. Your witness. In this condition, I don't want to ask her any questions. Dr. Naresh had warned that if she is brought to the court.. ..her brain can receive a jolt. Your Honour, call Dr. Naresh to the witness box. Place your hand on Gita and swear to tell the truth. I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth. Name. - Naresh Gupta. Profession. - Psychiatrist. So you treat mental illnesses. - Yes. During the treatment, you hypnotize the patients.. ..and take them back to the childhood.. ..so that you can find the cause of the illness. Is this correct? - Correct. Till what age do you take them back? Fifteen, ten, five. In the course of your studies, were you taught that a patient.. ..can be taken back to past birth? No. So your science does not accept that there is past birth. No. So, how did you take Chandramukhi back.. ..to her past birth during her treatment? She regressed on her own. Didn't you feel any risk in that? I did. What kind of risk, Dr. Naresh? That I may not be able to bring her back. And what would have happened if you failed to bring her back? She could have become insane. After that, did you ever take her back to past birth? Yes. Despite knowing that you have no experience in the field.. ..no right, and neither your science or the law permit it? - Yes. And despite knowing that Chandramukhi may become insane? Yes. That means you acted very unwisely. You deliberately put the patient at risk! A doctor like you shouldn't be allowed to treat people! And.. - Keep your questions within the scope of the case. This is the last warning to you. I respectfully beg your pardon, Your Honour. I won't repeat the mistake. Last question. Isn't it possible that whatever Chandramukhi said.. ..while being in her past birth, could just be.. ..the effect of her mental confusion? It is possible, but.. - But it is possible! Yes, it is possible. No more questions, you may go. Your Honour, I ask this court, I ask the law.. ..I ask the law-makers of the world! Can we trust a girl's uttering, whose mental condition is unstable? Can we trust a doctor, who deliberately puts.. ..a patient's life in danger? Can we trust a drunkard police inspector who has been sacked.. ..and who couldn't understand that Paro was a maid servant.. ..and not just a necklace, but she could have left.. ..anything in any of the rooms? Your Honour, this case is about the murder of humanity.. ..decency and nobility. This case is an insult to the law. Such a humbug case would never have been fought in any court. Therefore I request the court to dismiss the case immediately.. ..and honorably acquit the accused. Thank you, Your Honour. Today is Saturday. As per the law, you are granted time.. ..till Monday to present valid evidence. Or else the case will be dismissed. Papa, on Monday I will take you home honorably acquitted. Papa, I am very lonely. I want to see Karuna. - At this time? Yes, it's urgent. Go and tell her that Dr. Naresh has come. Go, hurry! Madam, Dr. Naresh wants to see you. Tell him that I cannot see him. Only silence remained in this house. You have come to shatter that also? I will apologize, but right now I have come with an important request. Tell me. Mohan and I believe that the evidence the court has asked for.. ..can be found in your mansion. Have you come to ask for our sword to cut off my head? An innocent girl's life is in danger! An innocent father's life is in danger. But you have come to Chaudhary Janak Singh's house.. ..with a plea, and we do not turn away those who come to this house. Therefore, tell Mr. Mohan that not only will I give the permission.. ..but I will open the gates of the mansion for him. Come in. Thank you. Go in. Thank you. You can enter any room you wish to. This? - It used to be the drawing room. Why did you bring me here? "Sometimes it becomes memories in adverse situations." "Sometimes it becomes the bright future in the springtime." "There is darkness in one hand and a lamp in the other." "Destiny only creates the cycle.." It was here only. Where did it go? Paro. I had come to get my necklace! That night, even if some God from heaven had seen what I saw.. ..he too would have descended to this room.. ..and it would have happened just the way it did. I will take care of you all your life. And I will give you whatever you want. Can you return Madhav to me? I am aware of your sorrow, but Paro.. Don't you ever touch me, junior master! And if there is God, and if there is justice, then junior master.. ..just like Madhav was snatched from me.. ..someday, fate will snatch your most precious thing! 'Come on, son!' I am showing compassion to you, but you keep cursing me! 'Son, come on!' Shut up. Senior master will hear you. 'Son, we are getting late.' I will scream and tell the world! - Don't go out! I will tell the senior sir! - Don't go out! 'Shall I come up?' Senior sir.. I'll be right there.. Father, you will get tired if you climb the stairs. Go and sit in the rickshaw, I am just coming down. Son, what are you doing? Father, I told you not to climb the stairs! It's not good for your health. Yesterday you had fever. Okay, I will wait in the rickshaw. Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi! - Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi, what happened after that? Chandramukhi, what happened after that? - Mohan! Mohan, don't ask her anything more, her condition is not good. At least we found out how Chaudhary Janak Singh.. ..had killed Paro. - Yes. But tomorrow, how will I present the evidence to the court? The court needs evidence! - Yes. Look, take her home and send a police inspector. I.. I will try to find out something more. Murder was committed! In that very room! How will you unearth evidence for something that didn't happen? Try to remember, did someone come.. ..after senior master left for Delhi? No one did, sir. - Think! Try to remember, maybe somebody did come! Yes, sir. A mason had come. To repair a broken wall upstairs. What was his name? Beliram. - Beliram? Where does he live? Down there in the village. Where is Beliram's house? - Over there. He has gone crazy ever since his son died. Beliram! - Have you come to express condolences? He died last year. Beliram, I need your help. - Now nobody comes to express condolences. Beliram, listen! Listen to me! Listen to me! - Let me take rest. I want to ask you something. - Is that so? Do you remember the mansion? Junior master had taken you there. He might have taken me. Nowadays, you don't get good tobacco. Drink water. It has been 30 years. Think. 30 years ago. I used to work very hard. The junior master had taken you there. To the mansion. The mansion! The mansion? - Yes. Okay. Come with me. Yes! This is the one! The mansion. It has become very old. Doesn't anyone live here? Come on. Come on. Who is she? Who is she? The junior master said it was an urgent job. I shouldn't tell anyone. I'm sure he must have hidden treasure in there. - Really? Come. - Come. There should be a door here. Open it. Yes, there is. There must be stairs. - There are. Come. Upstairs there is one more room. Small one. Yes, there is. Yes. Yes, this is the one! But now it has changed. Yes, yes, there it is! - What? What? - I had put those bricks! That treasure.. the thing you were talking about.. - What? Whatever you were talking about, where is it? Tell me! Behind! - Behind? Behind the bricks! - Behind the bricks! We will have to break the wall. You can do whatever you want. Inspector! Constable! - Sir! Break it. Start from there. - Okay sir. Up there. Over there. Careful. It looks like a wooden box. Yes, sir. - Take it out. Sir, something is written there. J. S. Mohan, I have lost. Mohan, my life is ruined in every way. Once you had told me that if ever I need your help.. ..you will readily give it. Mohan, didn't you say that? Yes, I had said that. Mohan, help me today. My father's life is in your hands. Mohan, I beg to you to spare his life. Now the matter is no longer in his hands. It is in the hands of the law. Constable, tomorrow this skeleton.. ..will be presented in the court, with due precautions. Yes, sir. Consider Mr. Chaudhary as good as gone. Today she is sleeping peacefully. The evidence was unearthed. - Good. So why do you look troubled? Madam, my daughter is very ill, I will go and make a call. Is the public prosecutor there? - No, he is not there. I am Dr. Naresh speaking. What's the matter? The mansion is on fire! - The mansion?! Nobody move ahead! Doctor! Karuna! Karuna! Karuna! Karuna! Karuna! Karuna! Karuna! Karuna! Oh, God! Call an ambulance. - Okay, sir. Mohan. Mohan. Mohan. Karuna. Karuna. - Mohan. I have saved papa's life. Oh, God! I feel very sorry that we have to carry on the court proceedings.. ..on this sorrowful day. The public prosecutor can present evidence if he wants to. Your Honour, I have nothing to say.. ..except that I want to withdraw this case. - Pardon me, Your Honour. I request you to let me speak something. What is the use when the case is being withdrawn? Your Honour, knowing that, I seek permission to say something. Permission granted. Your Honour, there is a higher court beyond this court.. ..the verdict of which has touched my soul. There, evidence is not asked for, but punishment is given. The evidence that this court needed must have been found.. ..but my daughter burnt it. And because she found that her father was guilty.. ..she died in the fire. Which punishment can be more terrible than the fact that.. ..this wound will keep festering till my death. Destiny has squeezed my heart in such a way.. ..that all my hopes, my desires.. ..my pride have been shattered. And now.. and now nothing remains. I had only one desire. To give all the happiness in the world to my daughter. To leave behind only happiness for her. But it could not be done. Just one sin of mine. Took her life. She wished that Mohan should marry Chandramukhi. I give everything I own to Mohan. And confessing my crime before everyone.. ..and after accepting the verdict of the Higher court.. ..I seek punishment from this court as well. Please, grant my request. Considering all the aspects, the court sentences.. ..the accused to life imprisonment. Bless you! Bless you! May you be happy! 'And if there is God, and if there is justice, then junior master.. ..just like Madhav was snatched from me.. ..someday, fate will snatch your most precious thing!' "It follows everywhere those who hide themselves." "It gives such a punishment.. ..which pierces mind and body." "Then it washes with tears the wounds of the heart." "Destiny only creates the cycle of joys and sorrows." "It is manifested in the lines on the palms." "Destiny only creates the cycle of joys and sorrows."
