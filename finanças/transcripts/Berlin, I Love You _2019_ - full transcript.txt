Natalie and I had planned on Berlin for our honeymoon until she realized she was in love with my brother, Rick. So I came to Berlin by myself. Well, it seemed like the literary place to drink myself to death. I avoided everything. Everyone. At all cost. Berlin was living, thriving. But I was a ghost. Untouched by all. The price is, uh... well, it's insane. How do you want me to pay? Vanessa makes the decision. Well, talk to your wife and let me know. Help me understand these Germans. Oh, come on. It's 3:00 in the morning. Sorry. Who is this? Vanessa made her decision. Listen, tell your wife thank you for choosing me. I don't have a wife. Who's Vanessa? Good afternoon, Mr. Lander. I am Vanessa. Oh, well, I'm Jared. Where are we going today, Jared? You should move. Oh, God. Natalie. Thank God. Listen I've been going out of my mind. Listen, just two seconds, all right? You blew it. You totally blew it. Thanks for nothing. Well, I didn't do anything. You complained to Frau Gruber about me. And you know that Frau Gruber is best friends with Herr Zimmer who will of course report this to Fraulein Platz. One more complaint and I get das boot. No, no, no, no. Look, I can't deal with this right now. You're gonna have to leave. I'm keeping an eye on you. What's your name? Uh, Jared. I'm Rose. How do you do? Oh, that is here. The new fragrance for men by Gio. Natalie, look, I'm so sorry. - Jared. - Look, this whole time apart... - Jared. - Everything is so much clearer - now, don't you think? - Jared, stop. Listen. Your brother and I are getting married. Jared? Take me to the nearest bridge. What? What the... I am loaded with several safety features. Why did you stop the car? Vanessa, why did you stop the car? She's not worth it, the girl that brought you to this. Excuse me for saying this, but she's a bitch. Vanessa! I am a Berliner, Jared. We are not known for soft language. She's a bitch. You will forget her in time. Wait. Wait. Is this in your program? Those of us who do not have the gift of life, truly envy the value of it. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. You shouldn't be saying that. No, no, no, no. Saying anything but programmed responses. No, no, no. No, no. Stop following me. Stop it. You aren't thinking of killing yourself anymore.

It's about Vanessa. She's not talking to me. Oh, you really did it this time. They kicked me out! Why? They said I make too much noise with the furniture and I do funny voices. Well, you do make funny voices. I move furniture around late at night because I've nothing else to do. I don't know anyone here in this city. I'm just a voice-over actor, trying to get some work.

I came to Berlin to drink myself to death but... I fell in love with Rose. - What's up? - Come down. Why? Because I wanna show you my Berlin! Okay. - Adorable... - Coming. ...avoid-at-all-costs Rose. Go away. I'll pay for it, you know. How? With a prayer? Where did you put your vodka, comrade? Vodka is out. Then give me whiskey. Out too. Come on, Michail. Stop playing games with me here. Sorry. Can't do it. Didn't you say I reminded you of your older brother? Is this how you treat a brother? No wonder he died. He didn't die. We saved his life. Me and the whole family. No money anymore for drinks. He was crying like little baby, trying to carve himself with his knife. Now, he's working for Google. Michail, I really had a bad day, okay? You sound exactly like him. I'll pay for it. Are you sure? He's not an angel. It's just costume. You heard her. The lady pays. Good-karma girl, huh? So? It's 11.99. You're making me feel really bad here. Actually, worse than our Russian dissident just did. Hey, I'm just inviting an angel for a drink. You're right, Michail, the last thing to go is really a man's pride. His mom's gonna be back in a few days. She might not be. His brother is still in the hospital. Yeah. But, moving him now, it's gonna devastate him. This is another new place with more new people. I think he's never going to see them again. Look, it's not ideal. I'm not arguing that. But they're not gonna let him stay here. Excuse me? Yeah? Um, chicken. Chicken? Yes. Liv, um, Nisar Raslan, is there any way we can make an exception for him? - Who? - The, uh, little boy who's younger brother is in the hospital. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Could we possibly let him stay here one more night? I wish we could but absolutely not. We can call the Jugendamt ask not to try and place him until we know when the mother will be returning. But he can't stay here unchaperoned. - Oh, hello, darling. - Hello. I can't believe you don't have olive oil here. I mean, how can you cook without olive oil, the base of all... what's this? This is Nisar. Hello. Do you wanna sit down? Oh, do you want something to drink? Like, uh... I only got water. Water? No? Okay. So, is he from the shelter? I know what I think you might like. Well... is he? No. I picked him up in an alleyway. Here, look. Could you just stop with the Arabic long enough to tell me what's going on? Well, he only understands Arabic. It's the only thing he has in his life he hasn't lost. And is he staying here? Should we go outside for a second? Two seconds, okay? Look, he's just here for the night. His little brother is in the hospital with pneumonia. And his mom is staying with him. I can't leave him in the shelter alone. It's not allowed. Well, what about his father? Well, his father didn't come with them. And they were going to give him to child services. If he goes to child services, I don't know how long it will be before I can get him back to his mom. So, he's staying the night here? Yes. It's just one night. That's what it is. Oh, when you're in the hospital with pneumonia you were there for two weeks, remember? What then? We didn't catch it in time. He isn't going to live that long. Oh, God. Oh. Oh, God. Jane, what are you putting yourself into the middle of? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Woo-hoo. I mean, are you even allowed to bring him here? You... maybe you could lose your job for this. Mom, can you please remember that he's watching? Well, I thought you said he only understands Arabic? No. He can understand tone. He can understand everything. Jane, just think what you're taking on here. All right. All right. I'm done. I'm done. It'd be nice to have another guest. Look. I cooked for you. Lemon roast chicken. You're favorite. You cooked? Why did you cook? I didn't ask you to cook. I didn't ask you to buy that. I didn't ask you to buy all this. I like my apartment with nothing in it. Sorry. It smells great. It's... Oh, shit. - What? - Oh, shit. No, no, no. I've just been really stupid. - I am... - What darling? No. I... I had plans for tonight. I'm meant to cancel. I forgot to cancel it. No. No. Don't cancel. No. You go. - I can look after the boy. - Don't be silly. I can't just leave him here with you. - Why not? - What do you mean why not? He doesn't know you. He wouldn't be comfortable. I can look after a little boy. You go out. You go out. Have some fun. Why? What was so important about me going out? Oh, well, I don't know. The thought of you maybe having some fun. I mean, the way you spend your life here... Well, how? How do I spend my life here? Surrounded by so much unhappiness. You've come all the way here to Berlin, to this little apartment. You work all hours of the day and night. You never eat. You never sleep. You deal with things that are out of your control. So, yes, actually, the thought of you going out, having some fun, maybe meeting someone is bloody marvelous. Okay. That's it. Meeting someone. So, it's... what? I might get married, move back to London, have a couple of grand kids, give you much brighter Facebook posts? Yes. As a matter of fact, yes. Oh, Jane, I just want you to grow up. I know what you're doing here is very noble, very well-meaning, but you're running away. It's an escape. It is not an escape. This is reality. This is Berlin. This is what life is right now. And I know that the whole of the rest of the world want to pretend that it isn't, but it is. No one's pretending. God, Jane, life is so short. I mean, it's gone in a flash. Don't throw everything away for this. Okay. Uh... you know what? I am gonna go out. Um, Nizar, I'm gonna go out for an hour, okay? I'm gonna... I'm gonna go out. And you've got to stay here with my mom. Is that okay? And then you can eat something here. And you can watch cartoons. And then, um... and then I'm gonna be back, okay? Okay. But just one hour. Um, if he... if he freaks out, - or if he needs me... - I'll call. Fine. Okay. Okay. Your brother? Can I come in? Uh-hmm. Yeah. So, did you have a good time? Yeah, it was fine. I just want you to be happy. Oh, mum, please, not now. Yes. Yes. Now, that boy in there... No, look, look. Could you go for anything? But please, don't go for him? Okay? That's what his mother wants for him. You see, it's all there. And how she raised him. You know, in all of my life, including before you, I have never felt more certain of why I was. I'm very proud of you. Wait a second. Could you hold this for me? Sure. Thanks. Wouldn't this be the moment now to tell me your name? I'm Sara. I'm Damiel. Where are you from, Sara? I'm from Israel. And you? Ich bin ein Berliner. At least until tomorrow. I don't understand. I've had enough. I'm fed up. Why? It's a pretty long story. Well, you know what? I have time. Do you have a place to stay? Do you have a place to stay? What does this say? Which means? This house used to be in a different country. Are we in East Berlin or West Berlin right now? Definitely West. Hey, can you show me the Berlin Wall? You're right on top of it. No way. Can you feel it? No. God! Yeah, I can feel it now. Hello. Thank you. So, what's shakin', baby? Are you serious? You're gonna hit me with that line? Why not? I like your style. Classy. Hmm. You must be some sort of professional. Nope, just an American. Do you mind? Do I have a say in that? What? Baby, you just set your movement back 50 years. What movement? I don't have a movement. I don't have time. I work for a living. And by the way, a lot of women wear suits, you know, old man. - I am not that old. - Uh-hmm. And you're a very funny lady. Jesus, don't call me that. Lady. Otherwise, we're gonna have real problems between us. If I don't, does that mean we're gonna get along - and be friends? - Look at this, first base, and you didn't even buy me a drink. Okay. Where I come from, first base is a kiss. Oh. Whoa! Holy shit. I didn't expect that. No promises. Why me? Don't sell yourself short. You're not too bad yourself. So... let's talk about you. - What? - Let's talk about you. Oh, rock and roll. Anything you want, baby. So, what's your name? That's me, not you. You're a real piece of work. I can make up anything, what does it matter? Nothing matters. Fine. I'll pick one. How about... Heather? Call me Heather. No, not that one. Why not? I once had a little girl a long time ago. Her name was Heather. And I never got to know her. And I have a father. What a coincidence. Hmm. Well... Just out of curiosity, what would you say your odds are right about now? Fifty-fifty? Fifty-fifty? Yeah. Look at you, you sneaky bastard. You really think so? - Fifty-fifty? - Listen, everything always comes down to fifty-fifty. You know, it's either gonna happen or it's not gonna happen. - Right? - Hmm. I mean, either I'm gonna get lucky and... take you back to my hotel room - and... - Uh-hmm. Love you till your eyeballs roll in the back of your head or... I'm gonna go home and play with myself. - Hmm. - I ain't got the answers, I ain't got no crystal ball. Something is either gonna happen or it's not. Yeah, I guess so. I like that. So, who or what didn't work out for you that you're here right now? You wanna listen? Sure. My flight's not till tomorrow. Oh. I really like you, Heather. You know, any woman who's ever cared about me or love me, I... I hurt and caused them a lot of pain. And I don't ever wanna do that again. You sound like a man who has a problem with forgiveness. Yeah. Big time. You should start by forgiving yourself. Yeah. That's what my priest tells me. I mean, what I regret most is, uh, you know, I had the kid a long time ago, and I never got to know her. What do you mean, had a kid? How? Well, I get hooked up with this girl. We were young, we had a baby. And she split with the kid. What would you say to her? What would you say to your little girl? Say, she walked into here right now, into this dipshit hotel bar? And sat down here and looked at you, and said... "Daddy, I forgive you, if you give me one good reason to." What would you say? What would you say? You know what I did for years? I used to pretend that... I'll be on a street corner and I would just be... watching people walk by and I used to pretend that... I'd see somebody, some guy who would be holding hands with a little girl, they'd walk up to me and the little girl would be... my little girl. And she'd say... "Hi, daddy." ♪ ♪ And I'd pick her up and I'll hold her, and just say, "I didn't know where you were. I didn't know how to find you. And I love you so much. And, and I missed you my whole life, and... I can't believe you're here right now." And I would hear her voice say, "Daddy, am I still the prettiest little girl in the world?" And I'd say, "Yeah, you are the prettiest little girl in the world. And I missed you so much." "Daddy... I missed you so much." I'm done talking about this. So, where... where shall we continue? What? This, where shall we go next? ♪ One night in... ♪ I'm in room 423.

Burke Linz, my favorite client. - Still in Berlin? - I am. How did it go? Yeah! Test went well last night. And they are talking sequel. Jeez. I mean, uh, it's a movie about the end of the world. I think I killed about seventy billion people. How do you make a sequel to that? How? What do you mean how? You know, you make the same movie, uh, a little different. Yeah... no. Jeremy, listen, I don't... I don't... You want that superhero money, right? Are... are they freaking out that I'm not there? Maybe a little. But who cares? You've spent the last two years of your life on this movie. Unless they want you to run the projector, - what else can you do? - Well... I'm exhausted. That's for sure. I might be losing it. Burke, go out. See people. Do whatever you do in Berlin. I gotta go. Think superhero money. All right. I love you, mate. You love me? Thank you, Jeremy. Jeremy, I wish you just listen to me. ♪ I came to Berlin with a bag in the dream ♪ ♪ Wanted to see things I've not seen ♪ ♪ What did I find? Many pleasant surprises ♪ ♪ Like the opera houses here ♪ ♪ And maybe I'll be the first ostrich opera singer ♪ ♪ In Berlin ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ Didn't want to disturb you. Oh, uh, that, that was really great. That, uh, you got a lovely voice. Really do. Really. Thank you. That's awfully kind. Isn't it, Lucinda? I'm Burke. Katarina. That, uh, you really create a whole universe. It's... it's... it's very interesting to watch. It's... yeah. Thank you. Um... got a couple of minutes till my next show. If you wanna sit. Yeah. I... why not? You're visiting? I am. Yeah. Yeah. You can tell? Uh, this isn't really a place where many locals come. Mostly tourists. Well, I mean, I... I have to say, it's really, really beautiful. You picked a great spot. Where are you from? I'm from New York. Where... where are you from? All over, really. I was spending a lot of time in Amsterdam. Bad marriage... parents died. Uh, came to Berlin for a little bit of a rebirth. Berlin is a city that knows a thing or two about a rebirth. Yeah, yeah. My father actually grew up here. He made shoes, uh, he... he had a... a little shop not far from here. He made this really beautiful handmade shoes. And they were the kind that, you know, if you took good care of them, they'd last your whole lifetime. And, uh... it's just not a philosophy that you see much these days, you know? But that was him. Yeah. He's a real artist. How long have you been... doing the... the puppet shows and... I like to call it theater. Theater, excuse me. A few years. And the ostrich... It was amazing watching the kids. How they... they really seem to love her. They... Yeah. She has many shows, - you know? - Yeah. Lucinda and the High Seas. Lucinda Meets the Ostrich King. My favorite, Lucinda on Irish Holiday, and now... Lucinda in Berlin. Lucinda is secretly in love with the giraffe, called Roman De Cleff. Huh. So how do you know so much about the characters? I mean, do you just make it all up or where do you... Uh, you take... you take a journey with them. It takes time. I just try to give them some humanity and, uh... integrity, uh... because if I don't, who will? And the kids? Do you feel that they know the difference? Oh. Kids are the most open, honest audience that you can find. Yeah. - Adults however... - Oh. Hey, I'm... yeah, don't even get me started on adults. With kids, you're showing them the world. And, and you're fulfilled? Hello! Hi. Uh, what do you mean? You know, with, you know, your art and... your life? Yeah. Uh, look, there is nothing more that I need or want. I hope you can say the same. Yeah. Well, I should get back to my show. Yeah. Excuse me, I don't... looks like you already got a customer here. Hey, you're gonna love the show. See, I don't speak German either. Have a great time. Not many people wanna talk to me about my puppets. It's been the best, best part of my trip so far, really. I... I needed it, so, thanks. See you later. Would it be possible to talk some more? Would that be... I mean, I could take you and Lucinda to dinner or something. She doesn't eat much. Well, hey, that's... that's more for us. Well, you know, it was nice... it was nice just to get the chance to talk you and to see the show. And, uh... I don't know, it really just, uh... Thank you. Sometimes I'm at the corner cafe at Rosenthaler Platz. Rosenthaler Platz. Great. Great show, go, go, check it out. So, this is how it all begins again. The feeling of fullness, of humanity. That love is possible. That everything is possible. At first, there were only ashes. And now, when you least expected it, you are, once more... in the Garden of Eden. Fuck! House of World Cultures. Ha! No one here calls it like that. We call it the Pregnant Oyster or Jimmy Carter's smile. Are you American? - What? - Are you American? Yeah, sure. No, no, no. A lot of police? Have you been to Turkey? I mean, there... You know, in Istanbul there is police at every corner, and they still can't guarantee safety. I guess under pretext of fighting the terror, they just want to control the opposition. Have you followed the politics there? Isn't that unbelievable? - It's... - Sorry. Do you really need to keep talking? I mean... it would be great if you just not do that. Sorry. Just a habit, you know? I love to chat with my customers. Actually, I'm, I'm a reporter, kind of, you know, neighborhood stuff, gentrification, migrants. The big picture, little things. No big magazine would hire me, unless I would come up with a story, you know, a big story like... opening restaurant in Neukoelln. You know what I mean? I'm Yasil, by the way. What's your name? - Greg. - Nice to meet you, Greg. Tough day, huh? I tell you. You remind me somehow of my first boyfriend. He was also a bit nerdy. And you remind me of my first girlfriend. She could never keep her mouth shut. - You like philosophy? - Hmm? I studied it at university. Adorno! No, no, no. Uh, I memorized that. Are you working in philosophy? No. Uh, I became an IT engineer. It was easier to cash in on that. But philosophy is something I'm still really into. But this morning... this morning... Do you think it's hard not to have a home? What do you mean? Uh, you're Turkish living in Germany. Yeah, but I have a home. I mean, I'm German, a bit Turkish, but I'm German. Uh, I mean if one, um... suddenly had no home at all? Because they finally decided to be true to themselves. That would be a high price and a real pity. Being true to yourself should always be rewarded. That only happens in fairy tales, right? Yes, it does, but sometimes, not only there. And we live for these moments? Yes. That's what we live for. - Go, go, go, go. - What? What? What was that? Oh. They're catch... they're catching up. Sorry! Hey! Are they gone? I don't know, I don't know. Take me to the embassy district. What? But we have to call the police! No. Please... we don't have much time. Yasil... you shouldn't give up on your dream... you know? Thank you. You're a good driver. Okay. Everybody! Everybody! Hey! Good morning, folks! - Yeah! - So, who's next? Who wants to sing a song? Who, who, who? - Me! - Oh, red leather jacket? - Uh-hmm. - Yes, red leather jacket everybody. - Can I give you this? - Yes. - What's this for? - It's the second track. You're not... you're not being high maintenance - are you? - No. What's your name? Sara. Sara. Say hi to Sara, everybody. - So where are you from? - Tel Aviv. From Tenerife, everybody. Sara's from Tenerife. - Tel Aviv. - Tel Aviv. Sorry, its Tel Aviv. Sorry, sorry, sorry. - You found it? - Party sound, right? Yes. Thank you. Hi. My name is Sara. I've been here barely 48 hours, and I already feel like I'm a part of Berlin, you know? But sometimes... you feel alone and you feel like... you're not heard and you're not seen. But when that happens, just turn around because there might be someone actually listening. In my case, it was an angel, with wings and everything. I guess, I just got lucky. So, this song is for all the angels out there.
