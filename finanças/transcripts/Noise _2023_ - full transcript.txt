This is our big bright living room. Ah, and my favorite souvenir in the house. Matthias. [giggling] Chubby little cutie. Here's where I'll do my catering. - For now. - Ah. And if I know what's good for me, I'll stay out of here, right? Yip. Get out. Oh, we still have to put that out with the trash. This? Why? You don't like it. Ta-da. [sighing] The love of my life. [mysterious music playing] - Ah, you're ridiculous. - What? I wasn't good? You are so good. - [Julius crying] - Oh. Perfect timing. [grunting] [Julius cooing] Let's go to sleep now, okay? Yeah.

Hey, little darling. Hello. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Who's out there? - It's Daddy and Uncle Timme. - Hey. Look. Say hello. Goo-goo. Wave to Daddy. [indistinct chattering] Hurry now. Hey, how you gonna feed yourself now that we're gone? I'll survive somehow. [all laughing] [Julius cooing] Oh, that is so cute. When I gave you permission to date my sister, I didn't mean you should both move to the middle of nowhere. I mean, come on. It's beautiful, but you'll both gonna be bored out of your minds after a month, right? - I don't know. - Just saying. We'll have to see. You sure you don't want wine? I'm all right, thanks though. Oh, before I forget, I brought something for Julius. Hold on, I'll film. Time for a quiz. What did Uncle Timme buy? Is it: A, a pet he bought on a whim and is giving to us cause he can't support it, or, uh... - B, maybe, uh, the 200 euros he owes me? - Yeah. Or C, that rowing machine that he never uses that cost a fortune. [all laughing] Ah, hey. Ah. [laughing] Belly. Oh, Belly? [sniffing] Ah, you're way too sweet. Are you absolutely sure? - I'm sure. It's his turn to have Belly. - But will you be okay without him? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Of course. [laughing] - You're a great brother. - Anytime. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - It's adorable. - Melts your heart, doesn't it? Look how sweet. Cuckoo. [Julius cooing] - Put that away for a bit. - One sec. How many followers do you have these days? - One hundred and ninety-six thousand. - Wow. And that means getting free stuff in the mail. Yeah. Every day he gets sent some stuff to promote. Okay. [laughing] And they send stuff for you too? - [grunting] - Yeah. The whole nursery's completely sponsored. And we have diapers for a year. - [all laughing] - Seriously. - He's gonna love this. - Right? [Julius crying] [soft music playing] Here's the culprit, the cause of my messed up sleep schedule. Why do you have to keep me up, buddy? You're lucky you're so cute. Oh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Okay, little bud, we're gonna have a drink. [smacking lips] Yeah. - Rough night? - Quality time with my son. Sorry. - I guess I didn't hear him. - That's okay. [ominous music playing] - Seriously! - Hm, what's wrong? Take a look. Dad! Dad! - Oh, God. - What are you doing here?

Your teeth are gonna fall out. [dramatic tone] That pond there, I dug it all by myself, you know. Oh, is that right? - Impressive. Did you know, Matt? - Hmm. And he came by to make sure I didn't fill it in. [dramatic music playing] Michelle always wanted a pond. Okay. Come on, Dad, they're waiting for you. I used to walk along here almost every day when I went to work. Some afternoons I would even go home so I could see Michelle. To be near Michelle. Michelle always wanted a pond. She always wanted to live near a pond. [indistinct chattering] I walked here all the time. I knew every branch on every tree almost every day. [indistinct chattering] [mumbling, gasping] Hey, come on, Dad, let's go. You know, some managed to escape, but the water was coming much too fast. - Dad, what are you talking about? - We kept a lot of it out of the paper. Dad. Dad! It's unbelievable how much money was involved. With who? Oh, I warned them so many times, but did they listen to me? Ha! And after it was too late, the clean up fell to me. [chuckling] It's so much more than that happened there. Maybe now is the time to find out about it. There you are, Pol... Sorry, we're short-staffed. We had two medical emergencies. - Hmm. - And whose fault is that? Well, he's all right. He walked back to our house. He must have been on autopilot. You know you not supposed to run away. Do you want another coffee? - Need anything else? - No, thank you. [breathing heavily] [ominous music playing] [indistinct chattering] [water bubbling] [giggling] [Julius cooing] [Julius cooing] - Hey. - Hey. So how was he? Fine. We talked. I'd even say it was a good talk. Okay. - And how was he with you? - How was he? You know... He has high expectations for me. You don't just make it overnight. [sighing] Well, you did. Hmm. [Julius cooing] I got us some strawberries. - Do you want some? - Please.

Something about an accident at his factory. [sighing] - Pol's confused. - There's a lot online about it. I want to do this for him, babe. Shouldn't you focus on something else? Something, I don't know, something both of you can do? Yeah, this. [chuckling] You know, this is something we can do together. - I don't know if it's a good idea. - My followers think it is, so. Okay. [soft music playing] Hi. [bells ringing] Hi. - What can I do for ya? - What a beautiful store. Ya, um... Well, I'm new to the neighborhood, and I run my own little catering business.

I'm not big on retirement homes. Who is, right? So then, who are you? Uh, I'm Liv. I'm, uh, Matthias' girlfriend. Ha, the Matthias... Hm. I didn't think he'd want to return here. Yeah, we really just wanted some peace and quiet. And he can find that here then? Uh... I don't follow. Uh, well, Some things are better left alone, aren't they? Uh, yeah. I, um... Uh, I...

Matti, help me. Give me a hand. - So this is your father's factory? - It was. Nice. It's like a jungle in here, Matti. Come. Can we... Can we go in that way? [door squeaking] Come on, through here. [building rumbling] Jesus, it's huge. [Timme grunting] This place is disgusting. What are you even looking for? I don't know. I just wanted to see it for myself. This is just like a maze. Everything looks the same. [pipe rumbling] What happened here, man? Matti, this is just more junk. You not gonna find anything. You don't know that. Give me that. [groaning] [echoing pinging] You found something. - You taking it? Where? - Come on, let's go. Matti, this isn't the way back. [hissing tone] Oh, God. Ugh, damn. It stinks in here. [flies buzzing] Jesus, this is not normal. Oh, my God. [Timme moaning] I want to go, Matti. I'm leaving. Matti, come on. [soft music playing] Hm. Hey little guy. - Hello. - Hey. I, uh, I just made some coffee. Can I get you a cup as well? Yeah. Yeah, please. Thank you. Hm. That's awfully nice. A hot cup of coffee. Here we go. [groaning] Cookie. - And this is for you. - Thanks. Oh, would you just look at you. [all giggling] He looks a bit like Pol. Pol from the old days. [all laughing] Yeah, I should hope so. So how do you two know each other? [gasping] Oh, from, uh, from Michelle. She was my, uh, she was my best friend. - Oh? - Yeah. Then I woke up one day, and it had been a year since we'd spoken. - Time flies, doesn't it? - Yeah.

Well, a long time ago now. I was still young. Oh? Yes. And after that he... He didn't come to the village very much after that. - [bells ringing] - Hey, Pierre. And what would you like? - I'll have a pound of ground beef. - Coming right up. - [Pol] But these hallways here, you see? - [Matti] Hm-mm. They went much further than that. Here too. And few people could find their way around in that maze. Very few. The rest bought maps. But if we ever lost power, they'd be impossible to read. [laughing] Yeah, more than once, we had somebody get lost for a few hours. And after the accident, did they search the holes? Yeah, but not all. Uh, yes, there was that one part blocked off, the water was too high. Do you still have those maps? In the attic, I'm pretty sure.

There were many more, and my father knew that. But he couldn't say anything about it. This! I'm gonna help him. The evidence is right here. Here. Morning. - Hey! - [Matti] He was right, my father... - Wake up. Let's go. - Oh. My dad was right. [baby mobile playing] Smoothie? You've been working so hard, I thought this would help. Good? I have to stop by Dad's later. We, um, got some things to discuss. Yeah, sure. What do you mean, sure? Look, I've already secured two more sponsors, and Dad likes it when I go to see him. I miss you.

[sighing] That's all you do. - You just ask me how I am. - Sorry? Liv, I just want to be alone for a while, okay? That's how you spend all your time. You lie in bed all day, and when you're awake, you're impatient and cranky. Why do you think that is? I mean, I don't see you walking around at night with the baby. Oh, you think we're competing for Instagram likes with our parenting or something? - That's absurd. How could you think that? - This again! When am I gonna get some respect? No idea. Maybe when you stop playing around and... Ah, it's that easy. This coming from the woman who spends all day baking pies. - You've never had a problem with that... - I do now! [breathing heavily] Listen... By the way, I make a lot more money than you do with your shitty food. - Congratulations! - What do you mean? Me and my shitty pies have to go. Which I bet you forgot.

There's so much crap we give up for our kids. Hmm. - So what you said about Matthias... - Uh, you mean the other baby. [laughing] Yeah, him. He freaks out at any sound. Yeah, but babies can be pretty loud, though. If he wants to throw his kid out the window, he wouldn't be the first. - Lau. - I've felt that before. - Maybe I do make things difficult. - What? No, silly. It's great to see each other all the time. Yeah. If you're worried, maybe you should talk to somebody. You know? Come on. Yip. Yip, yip, yip, yip. - I missed you so much. - I missed you too.

Come and sit. Timme got rolls and croissants from the, um, Nero bakery. And I made tzatziki. Juice? Or do you want a coffee cake, maybe? We have those round ones with raisins. I didn't know there would be visitors today? - Timme, pass me the jam, would you? - Matthias, I... we... Um... We're worried about you. You're exhausted, overstimulated over-everything, really. Of course I am. That little monster won't stop whining. What? Dude, come on, talk to us. Or maybe to someone else if that's easier. I know you can tell you're not yourself. Hey? Babe, are you okay? Your work with your dad... He doesn't even recognize you half the time. Okay. You know what? Leave. [Julius crying] I'm not gonna say it again. Yeah. All right. But get some help. - Bye, Timme. Thanks. - Hm. [Liv clears throat] [sighing] I'm... I'm sorry. I promise I'll try harder. I'll call him back. I'll apologize to him. [bike engine revving] Thanks. All right.

[flies buzzing] [screaming] [panting] - [dramatic music continues] - [Julius crying] Matti? [yelling] [ominous music playing] [gasping] Matthias will be wondering where I've gone. And how is he? Yeah, um, good. [dramatic music playing] I never see him. Always you with the little one. Yeah, he spends his time with Pol. Uh. Does he have anything left to say? He has the odd lucid moment, yeah. - Then I hope he uses them well. - What do you mean? Those two must've had a hard time out there, all alone in that huge house. It's good that they speaking again. They didn't have too many friends come to visit. Right. Thanks a lot. - Hey. - Hey. I can't believe he's asleep. Let's let him rest. Well? Yeah, you don't have to make dinner all the time. I'll just put this in the fridge. [Julius crying] [ominous music playing] Did it go well? Hm? The cooking. Oh, it wasn't great. - Oh. - But, yeah. - Not so simple to just bake a pie, right? - No. [chuckling] Hey. This is sweet. But it doesn't undo what happened. I know. Thanks. [laughing] Ugh. [laughing] That's disgusting. [soft music playing] Matthias? Hey, Matthias? I have to pick something up, but I'll be back as soon as I can. You can keep resting, Julius is still asleep. If you need anything, you call me, okay? Okay. [mysterious music playing] - Hey. - Hi. So you were best friends with Michelle? That's what you said, right? Yeah. And after she died? You couldn't be bothered at all with Matthias or Pol? Hey, look. Me and Pol, we stopped talking. But that's how it goes. What do you mean that's how it goes? For Pol, no one was ever good enough. Not even his own son. Understand? That scars a person. And you weren't good enough for him, either? Oh, this is just... No. Go on, out. Out of my store! Go! This means that... [whispering] Here. These prove it. You were right, Dad. There were many more deaths. [Matti mumbling] Here. The factory. This section underground was five times bigger. It extends to our house. The bodies must be there, the truth is there. I can show everyone, but I need to find them. - And no one will bother you anymore. - [Julius crying] Shh. [chuckling] Hey, it's okay, buddy. - Dad, wait. - Uh, something wrong? Dad. Wait. There's more. Here. What a cutie. - I can prove... - Yes, you are. There's 16 kilometers of hallways. Would you listen to me for once! I did what you asked me to do. Okay, fine. If you don't want to listen, this book proves the deaths. All 15. I'll show the world, I'll show everyone. Now move. I said get out of the way, asshole. Waste of time. Fuck it. - [Julius crying] - [ominous music playing] I'll do it myself! Pol? Michelle. Michelle... [moaning] Pol? Pol, it's Liv, yeah? Hey, it's Liv. [chuckling] Wait. I tell everyone, you know, and I'll keep saying it. I'm right, they wrong. There's nothing the matter with you, nothing at all.
