Yeah, anything's possible. That's wonderful. For us. We're gonna need a pro voice for this though. If this things for real, we can't use an amateur. - I take it that means you don't care for my voice. It's average. I guess I won't be going with you then? I guess not. Hang out anyway though. We may not be able to scrounge up a voice in time. Okay girls, are we ready to go here? Huh, huh? Wynzi, Wynzi, what are your doing? I'm still changing. my ankle. Ow. Let go of me! - We're going now, we're going now. It's fine, it's fine but we're going now. It's this brew you're drinking, it's rotting your brain. Come on, are you ready to go or what?

Hey I told you, put your faith in Matty Asher. Oh yeah, stay away from that rear cargo hold. Drugs huh? - Nah, we're carrying an ultra violent derange psycho killer. - Because it's catching, like a disease. Excuse me. A disease? Murdered over 5,000 women. - And you're sure he can't get out? - Nah, it's in one of them titanium cells, it'll hold him, unless we crash or something and then boom, who cares. Okay red light here. I'm gonna go get the space cruiser, you all hang tight, just relax. Excuse me. Excuse me, I was wondering if I might get my car. - Come on, you sucking maggot licking slut slug. Who was Ace Lucas anyway? She was our lead singer. She's dead now. Dead? I shouldn't be using her name, not if she's dead. Why? She doesn't give a shit. Come on, come on, yeah! - You know I was thinking, I want everything to be exactly right when we get to The Dream. When I walk out there, I want everyone to say "who is that?" Okay kids, here we go. Lounge, gallery, storage, rear corridor, shower, toilet, baggage. Oh yeah, stay away from that rear cargo hold. # Some people think they've seen it all # They have so far to go # And they may never understand # You reap just what you've sown # Well they think they know just what it's worth # But can't afford to pay # They reach out to grab a star # But they're too far away # We've come this far # But we're light years away so don't make it hard # You just can't look in the mirror # To see who you are # When you're lost in the ocean of stars # When you're lost in the ocean of stars # You better remember the days gone past # Civilizations we thought would last # Tell me where they are now # Lost in the ocean of stars # They're all lost in the ocean of stars # They're all lost in the ocean of stars # We're all lost in the ocean of stars Thanks babe. - We shouldn't zip through the forbidden zone Matty, it's too damn dangerous. Yeah, yeah I know. But it's the only shortcut through the alpha system babe. We've gotta make this gig. God damn we've gotta make this. You ready? I think so. Wanna try it? # Looking at the city lights below me # And I'm heading for another night on the road # Now I find myself in orbit # In a vacuum full of dreams # Leaving worlds behind # In hopes of finding destiny # Feels like light years away # Since I felt the warmth of sunlight on my face # Seems like light years away # 'Cause I made the road my home # I saw a picture postcard in the gift store # I bought it 'cause it reminds me of home # Racing through corridors to nowhere # Only to find the same old crowd # It leaves you weak # But it can keep you from what's mean to be # Feels like light years away # Since I felt the warmth of sunlight on my face # Seems like light years away # Since I've seen a ray of sun on a cloudy day # Light years away # Light years away Top job babes. Really, yeah. It was okay. Don't worry about her, she's fried. We'll have them don't worry, especially with this Radioactive Dream gig. Piece of cake. No problems here. We'll be there in a few minutes. Million bucks. I heard that The Radioactive Dream gig can make you or break you? Yeah. Flop there and it's over, scary. Bree, Bree you alright? Wynzi? Wynzi?

Come here quick, there's something moving in the sand. What? What? It was moving in the sand. That's not funny. There it is again! There it is again. I'm sorry, I thought. - Hey did any of you girls catch the license digits of that maniac who almost- Shut up Matty. Know what a joke is? Can't understand a joke? Are you ignorant or something? Jeez. There's something out there. Man, golly. One little comet can do all this? Maxine. Oh no Maxine. The gig, the gig. Oh no I gotta get Maxine on communicator, she's gonna pissed off incredibly. Oh pink. Sunglasses! Oh no, oh my god. Oh no. Oh. Argh. What? Oh. Heavy huh. Not that. That. What's that? Communicators destructo babe. Well what does that mean? What does that mean? It means we're stuck here in the middle of Sand Central with no way to call for help. We don't got any fresh clothes or, I've got four cigars left that's what it means. Do you understand? Do you capeesh? - If this true, maybe I'll die or something. Probably. - Probably. Shit. Help on its way? Ah, communicators dead as a ripe sock. Typical. - Come on now here, does anybody have any ideas? Any brainstorms here? 'Cause we gotta make this gig, we gotta make it. Well far do you think it is to the nearest pay communicator? - Yeah, yeah yeah, it can't be too far can it? It can't be too far. How would you pig head? Probably a hundred miles or something. Better forget about the gig. Forget about the gig. It's at Radioactive Dream, forget about the gig? Are we in trouble? Nah, nah nah babe. Nah, minor hassle. - Yeah we crash on desolated planets all the time. Oh come on, shut up. You're trying to scare the bejesus out of the little girls? You scare the bejesus out of me. Oh no, no, no Wynzi. It's no biggie really, it's no biggie, trust me, trust me. Then call a cab, no biggie. Oh just shut up. Let me scam for a minute here.

You're tougher than most guys I know. - Remember all of the deals we're gonna miss. Oh shut up. Shut up. Shut up I've gotta call Maxine! She's gonna kill me, Maxine's gonna kill me. My name is gonna be galactic manure. I'm ruined. Cool down, cool down, God. Oh jeez. Okay, I'm going. I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna go. But it's gonna cost you babes.

Now don't go anywhere, don't leave. Be right back! Son of a bitch, what'd I tell ya. - Gee, did you feel how hot those suns are out there? Shut the hatch Bree. What you thinking about Wynzi? My face. It's beautiful. Oh it was. I'm getting crows feet, shit I hate them. Yeah. I've had a lot of bad luck. I'm sure Wynzi. I mean, I'm sure you've had a lot of bad luck. Otherwise you would've made it by now. I mean, you've got so much talent and you've got so many neat looks. That's right honey. Who are the Cruiseshacks? I overheard you talking about 'em. - They're this mediocre band who had a lot of luck, they got the big break. They're looking for a lead singer, anyway who wants to talk about them? We're much more talented. New band. That's right, a new band for me. We'll be thinking, we'll be doing. I can think. Forget the girls, they don't got nothing that I don't got. This is gonna be. I've gotta get to a fucking phone! Shit, the powers off. - Yeah, the reactors putting out a pinch of juice. It's not enough for the cooker. Enough for what? A tom of java. Hey Wynzi? Uh huh. Want some java? No thanks. I'd like to try some please. What do you think of this new girl? She'll be okay. I don't know. What do you mean? - She bothers me, she gave me a strange feeling. You know we can't count on Matty. I never do. I'm gonna go check out the communicator, maybe I can fix it. Voila. Women. I've got women, I'm done with fucking women. Banished by fucking women. I wanna talk about our situation. We're just waiting for Matty? - She wants to take a crack at the communicator. So? - That means we've got to save the power we have left. And that means no electron showers. No electron showers. Shit. So stink for a day Wynzi. - Okay, is there anything I can do to help Bree? Yeah, come on. What a mess. Can you give me a hand?

This is really stupid. What was that? Maybe it's- Shut up. It's breathing. What do we do? There's definitely something in there. Let's go get your bag. What the hell are you doing? God. What's going on? What's going on? You two guys know there's something in there? No shit. It's the thing in the sand. The what? The thing in the sand? She's been smoking with Wyn's herb. She serious about the thing in the sand? Mmm hmmm. Things in the sand huh? Don't worry about them, they're probably rodents or something. What you scared me half to death. Whatever it is, it's not big. There's something in the baggage room. What do you mean it's not big? What is? Don't worry you guys. - There's a thing in the baggage room! - It's just a cockroach, don't worry about it. It's not, it's not a cockroach. Don't humor me. Come on Bree. What's in there? Calm down. Whatever it is, don't worry about it. Wynzi, Wynzi come on. - The thing in the, what thing in the sand? - It's in the baggage room and it's not gonna hurt us, just stay out of the baggage room. It could get out of there. Come on, no it's not. The doors locked. - Oh my God. - Wynzi. Are we gonna like die or something? - Hey- - Calm down. No, everything will be, you're a wimp sometimes. You bitch Ace. We are not amused. - You better not give her anymore of that shit. Did you see that slick? You're funny, a regular comic. - Hey, did somebody remember to lock that door? # And you just like exactly what I need # I want somebody tonight # Give me your body tonight # I want somebody tonight # Give me your body tonight Hiya girls. Matty Asher, professional manager to the stars. Come on Matty. Matty come on. # You look just like exactly what I need # I want somebody tonight # Give me your body tonight Come on Matty, keep up. # I want somebody tonight # Give me your body tonight Anyone for a game of solar trivia? Oh. Boy Wynzi, you sure have a lot of makeup. You change so much all the time, it's hard to tell what you really look like. This is me. Under all this shit is shit, just like my life. Ever think about quitting? Never. If I didn't have the band, I'd have nothing. I'd do anything to make it Wynzi. Anything. Would you have sex with a funghi dwarf? Christ, no way. I did. That was really a low point. What happens if you don't make it? What? What happens if you don't make it? What do you mean by that? I was just wondering. Go away. Shit. Would you like me to get you another? Cruiseshacks need singer. Call. Excuse me Mandoa. Please. She's getting a cold now. You know you've got a great act. Very bright Mandoa. Ow. - Looks like you already gave yourself a break. - It's just a contact, what's the big deal? It's none of your business anyway. I thought you wanted to be in our band. I haven't decided what I want yet. Matty picked it right. What? Your name, Ace. Just like her. A little girl on the outside, a shark on inside. Cute. - Maybe you're right, maybe I am like her, smart. I haven't decided if I want you singing, if we make The Dream. Can't do that, Matty said- Matty's out honey. So are you. The other's won't let you do that. You need a voice. I make your shitty little band. I don't think so. You okay? She's really messed up. - Take us to the top Matty, the big lights. I will, I will. Oh you're bad. I am. You're wonderful Matty. So Mandoa's writing is really great, we ought to do it at The Dream. It's perfect for me. Get your sleazy hands off of my music. What makes you think I'd let you sing one of my songs anyway? Fine, I won't sing it. No one will hear it anyway. - Oh they'll hear it alright, they'll hear it at The Dream, but you won't be singing it. Wynzi. Wynzi, you want me to sing right? What? Wynzi you want to me sing right? Let her sing. See. You're still out. Ah yeah. Damn it, she's using the power again. # The children see Shit. Now that we're out of power, we're stuck in here with that thing. What are we supposed to do? You're the smart one, you tell me. - Dammit Wynzi, I told you not to take a shower. Shut up. - Yeah now the powers gone and the screamers dead. Hey. We're talking to you. You aren't supposed to be using our power. - Get your meat hooks off of me, you little bitch. Bitch? You painted little drunk. You're all against me. It's not my fault that you haven't made it, it's your own fault. - We know it's our fault, you don't have to tell us. Well then stop taking it out on me. Then stop ragging on us then. I'm not ragging on you. But it just bothers me to sit around here all day and listen to you bitch about how life is so unfair. You don't give a shit about your music, you don't give a shit about yourselves anymore, you don't even care if you make it or not. You might as well just be dead like Ace. At least we don't screw each other. Maybe you're right. Maybe I was being selfish. But if you weren't gonna take advantage of The Dream, I sure as hell was. Hey wait a minute. Maybe we're not perfect and maybe you're gonna be a big star and maybe we'll never make it, but that doesn't give you the right to judge us. We're doing the very best with what we've got and at least we're loyal to each other and if you don't like that, well that's too bad. I'm getting out of here. Bree! Wynzi! Mandoa! Bree, Mandoa! # Girl you got a way about you # Any fool can see # And the way the dance # Well, it just says something to me # I'll make it worth your while # Come on you know what I mean # I'll give you something to smile about # I'll give you something that you've never seen # And don't say you won't # Don't say you won't # I'm hot for you # You got me hot for you No. Munchies.

Don't you wanna go home? Settle down and have babies. Have my babies. Oh god no. No! No. - Come on, you look like they'll carry you. Come on, I can get you out of this nightmare. Come on, follow me, come on. Please, I think I can. Come on, this way. Just a minute. Why are we waiting? Shhh. Boy oh boy, that was close. This thing just won't die. I wonder what he's made out of. I don't know, he's some kind of a monster, he's something undead. Not like me huh? It's all been so crazy. It's a nightmare. - Yeah, that's the way it is down here on Passion Planet. By the way, my name is Ace. Ace Lucas. Oh my god. You stole my name witch. No I didn't, Matty gave it too me. You trying to take my place. No, no, you quit the band! - You stole my name witch. - No!

Band's gotta stick together. Mandoa, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to double cross you, I didn't mean to go off. I don't wanna be a star anymore. Come on, we've gotta get to the ship. You're going home, come on. I'm sorry. Go to the ship Judy. Don't go Judy. Don't say that you're going to have no fun now. Oh. You screwed us babe. No I didn't. Joined up with the Cruiseshacks huh? No I didn't. I was gonna make you a star. - You know it. - No. It's not right. - You know it. Where am I? I'm sorry. You wanna be a star? No, give me a prayer? You wanna be a star. I don't wanna be a star. I don't. No. You wanna be a star. The dream finished. Are you alright, are you alright? What happened? You feinted? Where am I? - Why you're at The Dream of course, you've made it. Come we must get you ready. You're on with your band in five minutes. Band? I don't understand. Dream? Yes. This is The Dream. But you're so ugly. So are you my dear. Judy come on. We've been very worried about you. Where are you taking me? We got this really hot black dress. - No, I don't wanna. - And a nice little wig.

Feel the madness stir within you, a cry of the universe inside your mind. # Lunar madness # Lunar madness # Lunar madness # Lunar madness Not bad Asher. Not bad. We're looking at a total, absolute phenomemon here. Well I wouldn't go that far. You don't need to, you don't need to. I'm just gonna take them over to the Adromeda- Wait. I love it when you talk Matty. # Every night when full moon arises # I feel a change within me # They used to call me moonstruck or crazy # It ain't hard to believe # Running wild with no room for reason # A periodic disease # We'll take a hold on a caught illusion # It's calling out for me # Lunar Madness # Lunar # Madness We'll talk later. I'll talk, you'll listen. Whatever you say, big boy. Don't touch my fucking hair. # Madness # Lunar # Madness # Lunar # Madness # Moving on to another show # One more tonight with no one to hold # I've been on moons where night never ends # That empty feeling comes back again # So I drift away to another start # On the edge and reaching so far # There's a light in the darkness that shines # The dreams I hope that will one day be mine # Never letting go we must hold on tight # Run for the promise and be willing to fight # Lips on the moon # Feel the power shaking you # Lips on the moon # Back on the road and we're not gonna lose # Lips on the moon # We are the witness to tales of doom # Lips on the moon # We better stand # Lips on the moon # After a while it's a matter of pride # They'll knock you down but you hold your head high # 'Cause somewhere off on a distant shore # Are the dreams we've been searching for # They come to life as we're closing in # We fought the odds and we'll do it again # Lips on the moon # Feel the power shaking you # Lips on the moon # Back on the road and we're not gonna lose # Lips on the moon # We are the witness to tales of doom # Lips on the moon # We made a stand # Lips on the moon # Feel the power shaking you # Lips on the moon # Back on the road and we're not gonna lose # Lips on the moon # We are the witness to tales of doom # Lips on the moon # We made our stand # Lips on the moon # Lips on the moon
