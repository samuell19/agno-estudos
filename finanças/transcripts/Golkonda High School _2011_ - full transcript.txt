90 days earlier.. How's the plan? I'm not saying your plan isn't having any point or potential. If we open a coaching centre.. A professional like you will make it grand success. May be.. May be a man of your talent shouldn't be so humble. You'll rock! - I know sir. Even if I rock, shouldn't we get ranks. Mr.Madhu! Ranks are like bank loans. If you know the procedure, it'll keep coming to you. Once it starts coming, it'll be loyal to us like a dog. Leave it on me. Your parents should've named you as cheat as instead of Kirit as. Anyway where will you get the place for coaching centre in our school. Maths teachers aren't worldly wise, know only additions and subtractions. Golconda High school has a history of being top school long back, but now is heading for closure, because of we trustees it's breathing alive, if not it would've got closed and a shopping mall would've sprung up here, you know that? I stopped it, you know why? - To put up our dream coaching mall. I'll you bring down the school. Hello, it's me. Tell me, chairman sir. Can you come to the boardroom now. Now. -Very important matter has come up. It's about funding, to discuss. - I'll be there, sir. Thanks for coming with a short notice. This board has a special place in its heart for GHS. But it's difficult to invest money on this school without results. At least in any one aspect, sports, academics or in cricket which you love, take GHS to the top place in any one aspect, if not trustees are against this. Kirit has a proposal. All members are supporting it. Kirit? I'm sure Kirit means some business proposal only. Kirit has an idea of coaching centre to train for IIT and EAMCET on school ground. What? I cant believe it. This is atrocious sir. Without that ground GHS will lose its identity, sir. What a great history the ground has, sir! How many cherished memories and how many victories! Without that ground.. years old memories are worthless to people like Kirit. You must do something and save the ground. Kirit may come to you any moment with this proposal. That's why I'm warning you before. Thank you Mr.Shah. Good luck. Sir Tell me, Jani bhai. If you don't mind, I've a suggestions sir. Go ahead, tell me what's in your heart. Get a god coach for our boys sir. Because they're playing worse than me. What a great time we had 15 years ago when you were here, sir. Time for it has come again. Haven't you forgotten it sir. Board may have forgotten it, but how can I. Do you remember the name that was under the paint-yes sir. Where is he now? Look.. look at our guys! You said champions but not a player can hold the bat also properly. Useless team! They'll beat Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Kenya easily. But start losing with better teams. Bloody rascals. Fixing buddy! Everything is money! Sorry, no other table is free. Even if there is, may not be lucky to hear your commentary. What. - Hey! He'll now show you how to bowl an in-swinger, you'll show cover drive and you'll show how to hit pull shot keeping body weight in tandem. Take it sir. What the hell man! Hey! There's only one disease in our country, they don't do well what they know very well, and talk too much about what they don't know well, look at yourself! You appear well educated, but criticizing Indian team for quite sometime now, how can I make you understand it it rained half way the match and wind direction has changed, that's enough for Brett Lee and Johnson to swing the ball, can you get it can you understand if I say Stuart clarke who learned to reverse swing the old ball, and has been rocking with in-swingers and yorkers, can you get at least that if they hit 100, we must hit 101, if we hit 100, they mustn't hit beyond 99. That's all you know about cricket! Right. Leave it Sampath, sir you too. Come on boys. Come. Why picking trouble with them. Did I coach and took them to task well, right. Be careful! Sorry about the table. Hey old man! Are you doing fine, Sampath sir. Brother Jani? GHS Jani brother? - Yes. What brings you here. - What's this sir. Excuse me? Whom do you want to meet? Vishwanath principal. Prinicipal. Yes. He has asked me to meet him. I am Sampath. If you go this side, you'll get quadrangle, second room on the left side. - I know. Oh you also know you're blocking the way to staff room. Sorry. That?s okay. Do you teach English? - How did you guess it right? Usually they're always beautiful. Meet the principal. You know, right Can I coming sir? Oh, Sampat. Come in. After many years. -How are you doing sir? I am fine. How are you doing? Not well. You can see it, sir. You really don't know what I'm seeing in you. Come. I do see sometimes the names of your batch mates in newspaper, but never saw your name. Aren't you playing cricket now. Do I look I'm a player now My cricketing days are over long back. Are you working. No, tried luck with business, but gave up after differences with partners. For the present I'm unemployed. It's been 15 long years since GHS lost inter-school tournament, right Sir. You must coach our cricket team and win back the cup. We must be inter-school champions again. That's your responsibility. You've got only three months, when are you starting. Don't take it bad sir, it's been years since I held a bat. I don't think I can coach these boys. What's the use if you think, I must think. I've decided. I mean.. I think.. in three months.. Please leave me alone sir. I'm ready with your appointment letter too. Confident that you'll not refuse me. Not that sir.. you.. This is not just about winning the cricket championship, the matter is something really big, - Sir, what I'm trying to say.. Vishwanath sir ? Please come. I've got you. - Are you fine sir. Excuse me. Please take your seat sir. - Nothing much, just a small matter. We've come to you directly without a formal meeting. Anyway you'll say yes to it. - Please take your seat sir. Please sir down. Nothing much, our play ground is going waste unused, building a coaching centre to coach students for IIT and EAMCET, if we attract students and parents, trust me sir, in a year our school would see good times again. But Kirit.. Our boys are going from bad to worse, today a man who ran a one room coaching centre is jeering at me, Try to listen to me sir.. locking students in rooms and bombarding with lessons isn't education, I don't want GHS to become like that, Sir.. -education should have everything, that is GHS philosophy, sports, Without extra curricular activities students will not grow up,.. ..- You are right. GHS play ground has a very important place in the history of this school. We're not running charity institution to support great philosophies. What you're calling as play ground is crores worth real estate. Not your back yard. Forget about studies, is GHS at least in the last place in any sport. Tell me, in this beautiful ground, there's not a blade of grass even for buffaloes to graze. Other than loafer boys to play gilly and old people for morning walk, this ground isn't used for anything else. I want to turn this wasteland into a gold mine, but I don't know why you are objecting to it. Gentlemen, give me a year, I'll make GHS the best school.. A man is drowning in water and you're asking him to swim to get gold medal, you're unable to understand, we don't have money, you arts, cricket, marble, sports certificates will not help us in any way, ranks, we need only ranks, think practically like a business man. This is a school not a business. Every thing is business in this world. In this modern times, education is a wonderful business. Trust me. Really who said that. Excise me? Who are you? Isn't he your assistant? He is.. I'm the new cricket coach of GHS. My name is Sampath. What? Is there a team for this useless school. Are you their coach when were you appointed. Just now sir. Oh! If principal has appointed you, then the matter is serious indeed. What are you trying to achieve sir? We are second from the last for the past 15 years, you want to achieve the first place from the last. Inter-school knock-out tournament is about months away, if I say GHS cricket team will be the next champions.. Where did you find this man? Cup? Really cup. Then, winning cups will fill the cup board, what's the profit for us. There is, sir. If I say my team's performance will inspire students to study well.. what's this sir Serious or joke? I'm serious sir. If it happens as we say, will you give whatever we ask, sir. Is this challenge yours or his - I know you love challenges. My life is full of challenges and victories only. If it happens as you say, Man! What's your wish. Pass a legal resolution never to construct.. ..any building on GHS play ground. What is this? Is it a film enough of it. Its not possible. Wait sir? Vishwanath. You've checkmated well my coaching centre plans. Okay. Just only one rule, if your useless team loses, you and your Guru Vishwanath must quit your posts. Never be seen in the school's vicinity. If I lose, I'll resign from the trust board. Okay. Perfect. In three months, you or me. So, the meeting is over. I didn't expect this but was exciting. We'll take leave. All the best champion. Oh you think we can win. We trust ourselves and our beliefs, sir. If we start thinking we can win, it'll give us confidence. Excuse me sir. Hi miss Anjali, come. I am sorry. Were you waiting for long time. No, I came in just now. I need your sign on this. Okay. Anjali this is Sampath. He's our new cricket coach. - We met little earlier sir. Oh that's good. Sampath. She is Anjali, GHS old student. He know sir. Really? How? Generally cricketers are handsome, right sir. Oh! Is it? Glad to have you here. Thanks. Can I see your facilities. Sure. Yes sir. Get a notice typed to assemble all the cricket playing boys at 1 pm. Okay? ? Okay. Congratulations sir. I'll get it right now sir. Did you see sir? -I did. Just junk! Just like this school. What has happened to our school, Jani bhai What am I to tell you sir It's problems everywhere. Vishwanath sir too left after you finished your tenth class, after that not a principal who joined was good or efficient man, people who made money and got them transferred, no one bothered about the teachers, teachers too stopped bothering about students. What about the students' condition now? It's students who lost everything. Parents get tensed and if they don't score marks, they send them for private tuition, nobody bothers about them in school, no sports or cultural activities, one must have love for school, what if they fear or hate it. Don't parents protest? What sort of children join our school! People who can't afford for better school or old students. Parents are more tensed than the kids. Parents wants their ward to be engineer or IIT. That too first rank only. Our vice principal Madhu, Maths teacher, he scares the parents to send their children for tuition, and makes money unabashedly. If by chance any student gets rank, parents queue up to him. Following him other teachers too started taking tuition. Oh god! Look at this. Okay forget about it, tell me about our cricket team. Team Nothing of that sort is here. Students who don't study well sometimes play cricket. I think you're the right man to coach them, sir. But I haven't yet settled in my life. - Because you're not after money. You do what you believe. That's why Vishwanath brought you here. Come. Okay Let's be back at .3.30 pm. Let's decide then. For you only, read it. All student interested in playing cricket.. ..should present at the ground by 3.30. New coach! Will you bat first always? - Stars will play first, boy! Siddhanth - Proud star! Give me your cell phone. He'll not give because he'll get a call from Manisha now. You met Manisha today, right, what happened? Manisha. Hi Manisha Hi. You know. My dad bought a cell phone for me. Shall we play a game. Tell me a number, let me see if I can remember it Why do you want my number for that won't any number do? No. If we exchange our numbers, we can talk to each other every day. If we don't exchange we don't have to talk, right. But… Manisha… Stop it.. go away! Look at him! - You're teasing him, right what about you then. Rajinder - Punjabi wicket keeper. He drops catches while keeping wickets here, He falls flat on seeing girls near home. What happened, what's this? Clean bowled! Leave it! Vikas. Oh you remember tomorrow evening's movie plan. My dad will kill me. Your dad Is he still like Prakash Raj of Bommarillu or changed. Vikas - Father fever. Looks like you're keeping your son's progress in your pocket. He says he'll become a writer, but when I see him marks in Maths, physics and chemistry, I'm surprised how could he be my son. We must be very strict sir, my daughter is just seven, she said hockey after watching film 'chak de India', I said I'll bash you. Absolutely. My son bunked classes for cricket without informing me, I broke his legs. I don't want to be my child an artist. Art can feel, He will do MBA. Children, tender flowers, all this is humbug. How can children know the value of education, we must put them in line with fear or scaring them. We must scare them. They must shiver at the thought of father. How our parents did raise us. Got it I'm shelling out thousands, study well. You've to select extra curricular activities now. No need of anything, just enough if you teach lessons. You can't avoid sir, this is also part of education. Monday afternoon, dance and elocution. Dance. – Elocution. Let the boy choose. - He'll do what I say. Wednesday, Karate and science project. Science project. Friday, Sports and Essay Writing. Essay writing, right. Still in essay writing. Forget about me, hear about Ramesh, film shoot and his father. Ramesh. What. Ramesh - Film shooting when not batting. This is sixth tube light, you broke two earlier too. Move. Did your son eat? - I came after serving him. Tell him if he fails in half yearly exam, he'll have to work in my shop. I can save on his education and salary of the worker. He loves films, he wants to become a film director. Really recently he said he loves cricket. I don't know what should I make him Manirathnam or Sachin Tendulkar if he becomes anyone of these two, I can close business and make millions. Righ? - Stop joking. Tell him to come to the shop, he'll learn the trade. No way. - Why? He has film shooting tomorrow. Who is the hero Mahesh Babu NTR Ravi Teja? How many times I've to tell you, don't act, just behave. What do you mean by behave Should I've to tell you that too Action. if you tease my sister again.. He's telling it like a coward instead of bravely, I'm not getting the right emotions. Cut. Father! What are you doing here? I'm making a film, father. Film I'll show you a film. - No father. Father.. father.. don't beat me. Stop there I say..No. I'll study well, father. Where's the box? Got beaten up by Roshan again. Every day he brings the box but Roshan eats it. Varun - coward boy. How does he look like to you. He He looks like a Burger in uniform, buddy. What's in the box Lady's finger.. Lady's finger every day? - May be for developing brain. Enough of developing brain, get going. Go away! Go! Go! Can't you hit him back Always getting beaten up only. Shut up! If I beat every one for silly things also like you, look at his face! Look at the nose! Whom did you fight with this time Mickey - Short fuse guy Uncle, they're here for hours now. Even paid customers are standing. Bloody boys, they don't pay easily, throw them out. Leave it. Leave it I say. Leave it. Leave the place now. Enough. Can't you see, we are still eating. Is it your dad's hotel to sit here freely for hours ls you dad's hotel - No please, don't fight. What happened? Bloody, I'll beat.. You'll never change. - Get lost director. If you attend school one day, you'll not come for next few days. What Mummy returns. No need, I can see the flashback on your face, Ashish - Fears mother. Take the bat. Ashish! What did I tell you, Ashish. Didn't I tell you to study at least 18 hours a day if you play ion streets for hours, you'll get ruined, useless son. Don't worry because you're a student.. Shameem - cool kid. I'll supply songs and games. - What will you supply? Gautam - No problem. Today Karthik supplied in Patanjali sir's class, it was rocking! Karthik - care of Music If you don't relish what you're studying its waste to spend time on it.. No man worth would appreciate it. Get up! Where are your friends? Shouldn't you've told him? What were you listening? ls the music good Tell me. Stop! You tell me. Turned me into a lover.. I taught you a poem.. you didn't listen.. I'll beat you now.. Bloody.. bloody kids! Get out! Our team!

Two weeks and you haven't let us hold the bat also. Just making us run around, we are not race horses but talented cricketers. We too practice every day but this is too much. Yes sir, This is too much. Till now what you were practicing was useless. I'll know your real value only if you train properly. Oh you think we don't have talent? If you're really talented why are you cringing to run 20 rounds. He has started lecturing again. Tell me. There are many talented players in India than the team members. Why weren't they selected? Because they didn't have proper coaching. If you think our talent is useless, select a talented team. Siddhanth, I don't want just talented stars, I want disciplined players. So, as you say, I may select new players too. Okay. Select a team of your own choice. Let's play a game, if you win, we'll do as you say, If we win, we'll do as we.. Really! Between us and those boys. Sure sir. Now they have a goal. To achieve it, they'll strive united. You're the boss in this matter. Lets do it! Thank you sir. Hi! Hi! Hi Sampath.

School staff must play a cricket match with boys. Cricket match. -Me? - Last time you got me into this, and I haven't yet forgotten the shot and the place you hit. How can students improve studies with cricket Silly! If not the students at least you'll improve, right. Forget about kids, it's a good break for us too. It's enough if we don't break our nose or face. Don?t worry. Say okay. See that?s the spirit. Then, is it okay to all of you? Okay. What about you Anjali? - I'm an all rounder in encouraging. Perfect. Which team will you cheer. In which ever team you're playing. That's it! Superb. I'm Madhu, Maths teacher and Vice principal. Aren't you Sampath? - Yeah. I've been seeing from distance but didn't get chance to meet you. I'm always in class room. I too heard about you, I'm always in ground. What brings you here then? We teachers are playing a cricket match with students. Anyway, are you a bowler or batsman? I'm a man with knowledge and sense. Oh All rounder? No need. We can't stand if you play. Look at him. He's angry. Since one all rounder is angry, I'll bat and bowl. What do you say Sampath? Sure sir. Let's play! Ladies and gentleman. Welcome to the cricket match between teachers and students of GHS. Spinning the coin for toss. We'll bat first. - All the best Siddhanth. Thank you. Umpire. -Good luck sir. We'll be ready in couple of minutes. Okay. Good luck. -Thank you sir. Come on. We're fielding first. Good. -Come on. -Come sir. Slip okay. That's right. Old man is bowling! Stop it man. Stop now. Please take it. Hey, Hitler. Hitler. We want a six. We want a six. Catch. Yes. Oh no. Yeah. Yes. Very good sir. Gautam, go get them. - Come on Gautam. Good bowling sir! Excellent. ? Thank you. Good shot. Good shot. Hey man! Good bowling. That's okay man. Its 89. Let's bat like this only! come on lets go. Students' batting is over, they've made 89 runs. Welcome back. Teachers team need to make 90 runs in 20 over to win the match. Get out. Out. Giri, swirling! He fell down! Hey! Bunking classes to watch films! Bowl a bouncer! Catch it! Yes. Yes. You're the next, sir. Me? Same place! Nisaar in the box. Oh god. Turned me into a lover.. Without a helmet, you'll get hurt! Come on boys. Breaks his heads. Sampath is playing excellently but all others got out easily.. Come on. Madhu sir, please join us. If you're enjoying so much, why not sit here and enjoy. I know it, keep watching, 4 again! Hey hero! Unable to get him out. We'll win! With this the scores are equal, Teachers team need just one more run in 6 balls to win. Can't you get an old man out row yourself to death. Siddhanth, stop. Go to hell! What happened. He left the field! All right. What to do now. 1 run in 6 balls. Let's tighten the field! Lets go. Come on guys. Just stick to the basics, bowl wicket to wicket. Don't try to be smart. Come close. Everyone be alert. Come on, come on. Well ball. Just do the same. Well bowling. Yeah. Its Out! Just one more run to win, Sampath who made 46 runs got bowled on the last ball, match has ended in tie, both teams made 89 runs only. Sir. Good Innings. Well played Gautam. Thank you sir. Well played sir. They congratulate both the team for wonderful show. By the way is our coach batsman and bowler or bowler and batsman. He's an all rounder! Gautam's tactic worked and we got saved. He played on us like playing guitar and drums. May be he'll coach us better, shall we try. Okay, shall we? -Shut up. Where did you go away? How could you leave us midway? What do you want me to do then Not a bowler could get him out. For what you did today, if he says 30 rounds, I'm finished. Nothing like that, we didn't lose the match. We needn't have to listen to him. Thats all. Nice shot Siddhanth. But along with it, if you learn conventional Shots like cover drive, square cut, I've never learned anything from anyone till now. Whats up Michal. I know what you will tell about me, sir. You say I'm rash, I like to be rash. That's me. Boys come on. Noel. Noel. Get my bag. Noel. Sir. Every one will carry his own kit from today. Is that clear. Principal may get angry, let's attend coaching. No need, match is tied, forget it. You said let's try. I did Then. - Means? So what if I had, I heard Madhu sir telling someone, our new coach is old student and a drunkard. He was jobless and so our princi offered him a job. He's torturing us to impress princi. He batted well in the match, that's just a build up, that was also to impress princi only. - I told you he's waste, earlier he got us a kabaddi coach to teach cricket, now the new principal has brought a drunkard. What shall we do then? Let's see how long can he survive here. He's also just like all other teachers, I'm sure. Nobody is bothered about us, selfish fellows. Nobody is perfect. Take it sir. Sorry. Hi. Buy me a coffee, I'll forgive you. Sure. Ashok, One coffee please. Table. Here. Here. Sure. So, in yesterday's match, I didn't know you were such a good player. But how could you say good cricket players are handsome. I did say the truth, right wasn't it proved. Madam coffee. Thanks. - Welcome. But seriously, you played very well. But you got out want only and tied the match, right? Don't worry. I'll not tell anyone. There's no great secret in it, if they've to listen to me, I must show them I can play better and they've talent to beat me also. That's all Why are you staring. I mean. Aren't you always confident. But in few things. Really? Tell me one matter which makes you less confident. I mean.. For example. I'm not so confident speaking to beautiful women. But you're speaking confidently with me, right it means.. You're different. - Different means. Different means.. you're cool. Saved me. You're a good speaker too. - I'm a good cook too. If you come to my home this Saturday, you can enjoy my native delicacies. I can promise potato fry to Biryani. What do you say I mean I've to finalize our team. Let's do it, start it with Saturday dinner, you can finalize it by next dinner. You look more handsome blushing like this. Guys. Move. Move. Caption Gautam. Siddhanth. This is too much, will he remove him as captain for going against. What does he think of himself? Last year Siddhanth was the vice captain, how can Gautam be the captain. This coach is playing games with us. Siddhanth is coming. Hey man! You're not the captain. I don't want any place in the team. - Wait.. wait.. Leave me. We'll boycott practice if you're not the captain. Okay guys ? Okay. Then do as I tell you.. where is Michael. Isn't Michael your friend? -What happened? Did Michael attend school today. Looks like he got into trouble again. - What happened sir? Olympia cafe owner Liyaqat has lodged a complaint. It seems your friend has broken his server's head. Really. Mickey didn't come to school today. How can he come after committing the crime. if he comes to the school inform station immediately. Okay if not all of you boys will be in jail. Just kids and already become goons. Michael is gone. - Shut up, already he's in trouble. Complaint means, Michael may go to jail. What shall we do now. Princi is out of station, who is in charge now? What brings you boys here? Did you see your friend has brought police into GHS for the first time. May be it was a mistake, poor boy Mickey.. Poor boy I told you to study in class rooms, you're spending time in Irani hotels like goons, have grown up to break people's heads. Please sir, Princi is also not in town. We'll make Michael to say sorry. Please speak to police and save him sir. What? I can't do anything. Should I go to the police for some silly student's mistake. Michael's life will get ruined if police take him away. He'll not get admission. in any college. Why should he be admitted? He mustn't. Let him get ruined. Only then he'll reform. Will he take advice from people like me For example. I told you boys to study instead of playing cricket, did you listen to me? You went ahead and played cricket vigorously. No sir, please help us this time sir. Sir please. Sir please. Boys. The rules are very clear about this. If you see Mickey, please inform me immediately. I'll inform the police. Let the law take its own course. It's right that he goes to jail, rogues like him deserve it. You too stop playing silly games and speaking silly things, study properly. Sir please. No more discussion. If you make me angry, I'll debar all of you. Go. Supporting a goon! I'll debar you! I hate him. What shall we do now. I don't know boss. Let's go and talk to Liyaqat bhai. With him? He's the one who has complained. He'll beat us too. - Oh you've any better idea. No, right There's no other choice. Let's beg Liyaqat bhai, this is our last chance. Gautam is right, if not Mickey will be finished. Let's meet uncle and convince him. If he need let's pool our money to pay for the damages. Come, we don't have much time. What had really happened there? How would I know this could turn so serious I went to the cafe as usual.. Get one tea! - Okay, uncle. What Kabir wearing same color dress. Tie biscuits.. What man wearing similar dress like Liyaqat bhai? Wearing school uniform since both are uneducated. What the hell are you doing going to school? Aren't you loafing here like a goon bunking school? Whom did you call a loafer You only! Whom did you call like that I'll break your head. Bhai, a man has hit your server. I didn't want to hit him.. catch him! What happened Kabir? I'm scared. Will I go to jail Mickey, come with me. - Oh no! Where. There's only one solution to the problem. Come. I always tell him to stay out of trouble. Bloody idiot. Very difficult if police arrest him. - Would he be arrested by now. Kartik please. Easy guys. Cool. Don't kill us with tension. Where's uncle. He's discussing in the back side room. About your friend only. Thanks. Come fast. Hey guys. Hey Michal? What are you boys doing here? We came here to talk to Bhai about him. I too brought him for that only. - Where did you go away? Lets go. Come come. Please think over it once again. Hey Sampath sir. It'll make me feel sad if one of my student's life gets ruined. This is not the first time sir. He always fights. He won't reform till he goes to jail. Kabir, I know Sampath sir for the past 20 years. Please listen to him also. I'm saying sorry on behalf of Mickey, a police case can ruin his life, the boy is little rash but he's a good boy. Please treat him as your younger brother and forgive him.

Inter-school tournament schedule is out, I'm putting it on board. Schedule is out! What? Tournament schedule is announced, Jani bhai is putting it on board. -Come.. We've never crossed first round after losing in 1994. Right, captain of 1994 team was Sundar. It's painted on someone else's name. Some guy's! Which year our coach played for the school. Are you here Tournament schedule is announced. Really? Hey. Sharda, Tagore.. ..Nagarjuna Everglades, ..Shanti Niketan Gitanjali. ..Don bosco. First match is against on Bosco. Starting with strong team? They'll maul us. We've just a month only. Seeing each team is giving me shivers. Can we win at least one match No doubt. Boys! Why are you boys dull? -Knockout schedule is out. It's very difficult to play against Everglades and Govt. School. I don't think we can even win one match, sir. Better to withdraw, sir. Okay. Let's do one thing, no need to practice today. What sir? Lets do something else. Come with me. Yeah come on. Come on guys. Come on. Why did he bring us to the class room? Do you all dream. Hey! Come on. All of us we do dream. Tell me about your dreams. Last night I had a bad dream, sir. I and Salman were fighting for Katrina. But she rode away on Salman's bike. She never cared to look at me also, sir. I'm asking about your dream to achieve something in life. I want Katrina comes with me. I want to achieve it. It's not a dream boy, it's fantasy. Let's talk about it another time. Come on guys be serious. Sir. Yes Vikas. I want to become a writer. Writer? But my dad wants me to become an engineer. I like acting. I want to be an actor. Architect sir. Business man sir. Soldier sir. Teacher sir. Engine driver sir. Film director sir. Is that why you dream about Katrina Kaif. What's your dream about our GHS cricket team? GHS cricket team? - For your GHS cricket team. Come on. Just for fun. How about winning at least one match in the tournament. That's all. - That's too much sir. Come on guys. I'm asking about your biggest dream. - How two matches. It's really a dream. Go on. Quarter finals? Don't ask me, it's your dream. Semi finals? Finals. Yeah Final sir. Championship sir. Yes sir. The interschool championship is my dream. Champion - I don't know. This is biggest dream. Right? I'll write few names here. If you feel these names shouldn't be here, raise your hands. How you should say, sir, no need of that name in the list. Okay. No objections. Sir. Siddhanth. Spelling of my name is Siddhanth. Really? Happy now. Thank you sir. Isn't it great feeling to see our names like this. GHS champion team members. After 15 years, your Golconda high school, Is the champion again! It'll be fine because this is not my dream, your dream, your GHS team's dream, dream of every member of the team, If it wasn't true, Siddhanth wouldn't mind spelling mistake in his name. So, This is your biggest dream. Yes or no. I know why you all scared to say yes, but it's a dream which is hiding deep inside and scared to come out. Yeah! Just only one hurdle in achieving your dream. Your fear. Not to lose but fear of winning. You're even scared to think GHS as champions. You fear teachers will tease you, your friends will make fun of you, your parents will scold you, and other teams will mock at you, am I right. So boys. First we must overcome that fear.* That fear won't go by offering prayers or making offers. Or just dreaming sitting at home will also not do it. Plan every minute and work hard every minute. Importantly, trust yourself. Can you do it. Yes sir. What? Yes sir. I can't hear it. We can do it. So now. What is your biggest dream. Championship of GHS. Go GHS. Go GHS. Go GHS. These dullards who can't study physics, maths and chemistry, what do they get freely reams! Team, cup and they dream of winning it. Stop! Maths, physics and chemistry.. ..anyone can teach it. But you can't find a teacher like him. Go and win the cup boys! Yes. Go GHS. You'll die if I don't find chicken in your box. Again. Not just again, every day the same thing only. Want to get beaten up? - Let's play boy! But not here, come to the ground alone. Listen. Yes, the same cry but from different voice in few minutes. Watch out! From tomorrow curry in my box will change, If you don't change yourself, you'll get knocked-out. Go GHS! So boys, you were preparing all these days for this only. Your practice match is with Amaravani High school. You guys ready? Yes sir. I'm giving in writing every mistake you made ball by ball, Distribute. you mustn't repeat it in the next match. Okay. Okay. Yes sir. Come on guys. I want should be loud. - Yes sir. Shot. Good afternoon sir. Afternoon. I'll change and come.- Yes sir. Sampath sir - Sir is calling you urgently. Ashish's mother has complained against you. I'm a single mother, I don't have anyone else. I'm struggling hard to send him to school. What's this madness of cricket to spoil him. He's making them run for hours, children are sleeping by 8 pm. When will they study then. Did you hear that. Do you know how competitive the world is. Every second is valuable. One must be focused from this age. Cricket will improve the focus not diminish it. All I say is don't rub your wishes and desires on your kids. What are they rubbing children know what they want, Ashish tell him, what you want. My wish is to top the IIT, but I love cricket too, mother. I can manage my IIT coaching and my cricket coaching too, mother. Sir. It seems Sampath was sensational with staff. He has become a hero and I've become a villain. Casting is perfect in your story. - What's this sir. Stop that nonsense, children are tough nuts, they can shake hands with coach and quit practice. If I had expected this result, I would've handled it myself. You should've done it then. If we were so smart, why would we be licking wounds now you're right in judging yourself. 11 fools win can't improve anyone's IQ even by a point. Cut the call. A straight wall and a large doom in the middle.. What brings you here sir? - That should be our question, sir. What are you doing here? We are measuring the land for constructing coaching centre. What? Its okay sir. We are not disturbing you, right you carry on practicing. What's this, Giri? GHS lost a friendly practice match. So anyway they'll surely lose their first match, but tomorrow isn't an auspicious day to start, so if we start today, as soon as you lose tomorrow, we can start building immediately. Boys. it seems he'll construct a building on our ground. Is it okay to us. - Not okay sir. Kirit, please don't break the agreement we had signed. Please leave the ground.- Are you threatening me. Yes sir, can't you see it? Mr. Vishwanath. I'm calling for an emergency board meeting, you know why? I like drama very much. As soon as GHS loses, ground breaking ceremony resolution will be passed, how is my idea? Like your every idea, this too is useless. Go home and try out something new. Okay. Please don't forget about the meeting.. ..tomorrow in the madness of the match, sir. Boys, back to net. Don't worry sir, Everything will be fine. I really hope so. No way, we must win this cup. If not we'll lose our ground. I'll lose my focus without cricket, I'll lose grades without focus, and my father will ask me to work in his shop. How can anyone take away our ground This is our school and our ground. If anyone talks too much.. - Siddhanth. Whatever, we do mustn't bring bad name to our principal, coach and our school. Then we must win the cup. Boys, from today let's practice extra one hour. What about our studies then? Stop watching silly TV and study an hour extra at night. You can make films only if we win the cup. This is a war for our school and our ground, Yes, lets do it. Go GHS. Hey, Catch it. Come on guys lets focus. Hi. Hi. Last night I had a dream that GHS has won the match. Don't laugh sir, my dreams always come true. You will win. - They must win not me. Without they don't exist and we too. You've inspired this school. If that's true, why haven't people come to cheer. People who care are here, right. That's what we need, right. Are you so confident always? - Always. More so about you. True! All the best. Thank you. Ladies and gentleman. Welcome to the opening of ML Jaysimha interschool knockout tournament. The first match of this tournament is playing between.. ..Golconda high school and Don Bosco high school. Caption Gautam and K Ravindra walking out for toss. Heads. We bat first. Lets go. Come on guys. Well done guys. Come on. Don bosco's opening batsman Shirish kumar reddy. GHS has been losing in the first round for many years.. Shot Good shot! Ball. Come on GHS looses their first wicket. GHS 76 for 2, 10 overs. Captain Gautam and Siddhanth are playing a wait and watch game, Wonderful partnership is building in between them. Out that!! - Out. captain Gautam is out but GHS seems to be in safe zone. With some great hits from Mickey GHS has 17 in 20 overs. 137, not a bad score. Don't relax. On Bosco is really dangerous team. Okay? Be on your toes. Come on. Go GHS. Gentlemen. The proposal isn't new to all of you, let's start without any further delay. Beautiful shot. That's a bad ball. This must be out. Yes! We had taken a decision, right why now again? After the tournament. Why should we waste these few days too, Two wide. if we start now, coaching centre will be ready by next academic year. What do you say sir? Got it. Oh man GHS has to be perfect if they have to win this game. Anyone in this room really thinks our school will win the match. This is it Nisaar. You can do it, two more wickets. Nisaar is the bowler, can GHS do it? can they win? It'll happen as has been happening every year. Come on boys. That's brilliant, fantastic! Our boys will lose in the first round. Come on Nisaar, you can do it. Just one more wicket, that's all. Is it new to us, sir Catch it! Catch it! Take the catch. GHS has won, GHS has won. After 15 years GHS has broken the jinx and enterd the second round. So gentlemen. I think this meeting is not necessary any more. You were right Kirit, the auspicious day selected by you is really bad. Go. GHS. Cheers to our coach, hip, hip hurray! Hip, hip, hurray! Hip, hip hurray! Well done boys. Don't get excited. We've won only one match. We must make it a practice to win. So let's all be alert and focused, okay? Yes, sir. Children. Boys, if you win the cup, tea and biscuits is free for a month. Yes! For me. Forget it, play well. - Thanks brother. Win the cup, come here for tea every day, Bye sir. -Bye, boys. Bye ma'am. Bye. I told you we'll win. You seem to be our lucky charm. Shall I come to every match ten. Don't you get bored to watch all matches? Who said I'm coming to watch the match? Great game by GHS in the second round. Generally we talk about tests, one days and IPL matches only, but we forget that most of the players come school grounds like this. TV 9 is making an effort to introduce such future players to you. GHS which was an unchallenged champion years ago, but for the past 15 years wasn't able to go beyond the first round, but this year has crossed the third round, it has become a team with great confidence to scare even good teams, what's the secret behind their new energy if we win in cricket, it's like winning half of the war only, you must excel in studies too. Just like in cricket. We should enjoy it sir. Exactly. Are you taking tuition elsewhere? - No sir. Who can solve this problem? Varun. It seems Mickey rocked in your subject. I asked how can cricket improve the knowledge, you taught me a good lesson. The happiness of making a dullard like Mickey succeed is priceless. I must thank you for it. Greetings sir. - Greetings madam. Ashish topped the IIT trial exam. Ashish that's a great news, fantastic! I was little harsh that day in fear and anxiety. We are struggling to make the ends meet. I was worried about his future, nothing against you personally, sir. Nothing like that. I totally understand. -Thank you sir. A team doesn't need stars who play for personal achievements, but players who want the team's victory, with such an attitude GHS under coach Sampath has reached the semi final, our investigation has unearthed the inspiration to do well by this team. That is to save this ground. Vikas! Where are you going? - cri.. chemistry test, dad. Chemistry test. Forget about your studies, what about your extra curricular activities. Okay dad. Great. Science project. Good dad. Bad. Excellent. What? Batting, no I mean. Oh, no! Congratulations Vikas. Thanks dad. The war has begun. Turning education into a business, and thinking school grounds as real estate, land sharks who usurp any little place, against the idea that education isn't the only thing for growing children, they need sports and other cultural activities too, who wins in this war between two ideas will be known in four days. Over, we are finished. A team that was worthless, he has lead them to finals. Emon! If Sampath had been such a great player, why didn't he shine. To bring us down. School records show he was the captain of 1994 team, why did he stop playing after that? -How would I know sir? you keep researching him, he'll win cups every year. Please do something sir. If not I'll this job of vice principal and teacher. Jani bhai Yes sir. When did you come to the school sir. There's a name behind that paint, whose name is it it was years back sir. Leave it sir. Whose name is it Leave it sir. Whose name is it. Last battle.. You must rock, son. - That's why I shed 5 kgs, father. Is it over, brother. Just two more runs to hit century. Yes, hundred. Come out fast. All the best. -Thank you. Come quickly. Hey captain doubt! How many times will you check the kit come. Take a photo with my star son. - Okay. Slow motion is for films only, you must bat really today. I'll rock! Watch out! You showed me films, bat well, you needn't have to work in shop. Thanks dad. Come out! - Why. Ramesh brother, you must come back with the cup. Ramesh brother! Are you going for a boxing about or cricket match? I'm unable to take this tension. You'll not it umpire if you get angry, right. Don't give me new ideas. Time's up, all the best. Thank you. ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the final of ML Jaisimha inter school tournament. Let's watch the match between Everglades and GHS. - Go boy! GHS principal and trustee board members have come on to the dais, Everglades have won the toss and elected to bat first. Just listen to them boys. All they want in only one thing! Our victory! So, let's give it to them boys. Go GHS. -Hello heroes. Are you surprised to see me here. Just to wish you good luck. Looks like Sampath is angry. Seeing him. Okay boys. I want to introduce you to this gentleman. Mr.Sunder. -Everglades coach. Do you know him? I think it'll be fine if I tell something you don't know. Of course your coach knows it, but you must know it, right. In 1994 Sundar was GHS team captain, do you know who he had replaced then your coach Sampath. Yes. Sundar's name was painted on the board wiping out Sampath's name. Why? Your coach is a blacklisted cricketer. All the inspiration by him is drama. Didn't expect to meet like this, right. Well boys. Really wanted to wish you boys good luck. Though Sampath is not so good man, he has developed a good team, I too don't want Everglades to win so easily, So? Give us a good proper fight. Okay. All the best coach. Is it true what he said sir what had really happened then sir. Boys, forget about the past, it's unnecessary. We need to know it. Mickey what happens in a team stays in that team. No need for others to know it. Now let's concentrate on this game. Let's go. I said let's go. I request spectators to be seated. GHS team is entering the field. This is a prestigious match.. - Come on boys. Come on. ..for both GHS team and coach Sampath. Come on.. come. If Sampath's wish to win the cup and bring back the glory to GHS, Everglades who have been winning the cup for many years now.. Ladies and gentlemen the final match begins. Boys come on. Oh no. All set? - Yes. Everglades openers are in the ground.. Both have been making great runs in the tournament. GHS opening bowler Nissar is the best bowler of the tournament. Nissar is confused how to bowl to him. Come on boys, come on. Play. It is a good shot. That's a boundary. Come on, come on. Everglades on fire. Just focus, don't worry, okay. That's a six. Fantastic shot. Lovely shot that will be a four. That's a four again. Six! Four again. It's a sad beginning by Golcondo high school. Everglades have made 22 runs in the first over. Off side player Okay, Line and Length. Come on Riyan good shot. That's a massive six. That's a fantastic shot. Just keep the line tight. That's a beautiful shot, that's sox runs. Lovely shot guys. That's fantastic batting by Everglades. I'm sure he'll hit a century. Everglades have made 102 runs in 10 overs. Lovely, that's a good stop by Sushant. Well field. You're bleeding! Something is wrong here. Looks like Siddhanth is hurt. Can't even field properly. Oh no, deep gash. You can't play, come out. Come back man. Sir, is he okay sir? Noel. Go. Stop it man, stop it. What the hell! That's a big shot. Is that a catch? No. He caught it but crossed the boundary line. Well done. Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel! I don't know to tell how well he's playing here. Where are you? One more. Well done. Yes! Yes! That's a magic shot. What a wonderful innings. Everglades have made 191 runs in 20 overs. It's not an easy target for GHS. It's almost impossible to hit 192.. - Come on boys. Come on. The game is not over yet. - Against the Everglades bowling attack. Stupid game, can't even bat or bowl.. who wants to bat now Bloody match is finished. Who cares? 192 is very difficult. For whom should we win, I don't have any interest now. Our coach is a big fraud himself. Princi is here. You want to know why Sampath's name is under Sundar's name in the board. Right. Jani bhai, show them. - Yes sir. 1994, Intra school championship. Look at the final score card. Bowled Sampat, Bowled Sampat. Bowled Sampat, bowled Sampat. Total. 4 wickets. Nobody after number four made double digit score. Sampath sir made 98, yet how could they lose so narrowly. Sampath fought a lone battle to win the final as captain, till the last moment, but Sampath didn't knew there was a traitor in his own team, if Sampath helps GHS to win, fearing he could never become the captain, and it'll be impossible to stop Sampath's success, there was a man burning with jealousy, his name was Sundar, on that fateful day, unfortunately he was Sampath's partner, 5 more runs man. -Let's do it. Yes, yes, yes. No, no, no. Though he knew Sundar had cheated him for captaincy, Sampath never complained against Sundar, he resigned as captain taking the responsibility for GHS defeat, and quit from the team, after that match, Sundar got Sampath's name wiped out from the board, and shamelessly painted his name over it. Sundar's jealousy didn't stop with it. He spread rumours that Sampath played for self not for team glory, and spoiled Sampath's fair name, and ruined his career, and stopped him from getting selected to college and university teams, GHS glory too went away along with Sampath, after 15 years, on my personal request, he has entered this school to coach you boys, And you question him? They hate me. 15 year old kids. They looked up to you as God, now some Kirit has spoiled their mind and they're disturbed. Only you can bring them back to normal, they love you so much, Sampath. Trust me. Please talk to them. Before it is too late. 192 in 20 overs. Isn't it easy? Sir, we are sorry sir. We'll win this match for you sir. No, Gautam. Don't say that. You're not playing for me. For Golconda High school! Listen carefully that name. Golconda High School. Now that is your team. Recollect it, you made hue and cry when I made you to run 5 rounds, but now you're playing the finals with state's best team Everglades, Remember boys. Championship for GHS. that's your dream, today is the day to make your dream come true, yes, this is a match that should be won by a great school, a match that should be won by the real education, a match to win and tell every parent, teacher that just study is not enough, but sports too is our birth right, this is a match that you must win with pride as real men, real man doesn't mean throwing challenges to fight in any place, real man is one who faces the heat and struggles to win courageously, a match as a coach I must see if boys have become men or not, So boys today is your day. Today you play to create History. Are you with me? -Yes, sir. Are we going to fulfill our dream? Yes, sir. Are we going to win? Yes, sir. Go GHS. Go GHS. Go GHS. Ohh, that's nasty ball. Mickey's out. Hey Mickey. Hey Mickey, are you okay? Doctor! Doctor! Man, you're bleeding! Bloody. Already Siddhanth is retired hurt, now Mickey. Sir, he's bleeding. It's getting tougher for GHS. You need bandage. - No need sir. Mickey, don't be silly.-I am okay sir. Take this away sir. - Are you mad. Take it away sir. Please listen to me. - I am okay sir. I am all right. Didn't I tell you he's very stubborn. He'll not come, he's like NTR in the film 'Aadhi'. Come on Mickey. Go Mickey. Go Mickey. That's a great shot. That's a best shor by Micheal. Two, two, two. With Mickey's hitting GHS has made 72 runs in 5 overs. Catch it! Mickey is dismissed caught at long off. Just stay there. -Yes. Well played. Vikas, keep it up. New player is Vikas, he played a great innings in semi final, GHS depends on him in this match too. Everglades have got a great breakthrough. Come on Vikas. Come on Vikas. No, no, no. No, no, no. Come on man. Be careful Gautam. Best example of how pressure gets you out. – What man. Its okay. – Sorry. GHS captain Gautam is out to bat next, Come on two, two, two. faster, faster. Gautam is very good runner.. Gautam, Gautam. Come on. No, no, no. Listen to me. - Bowl well man! Howzat! How can he give him out. That's out. He says it hit the bat. - May be the umpire is deaf. He'll not eat food for a week now. I nicked the ball sir, but he says LBW. Play carefully, give him stand. Got it. Okay go ,alright. Okay, stay with Gautam. Oh what a shot. What a shot. Has scored the first boundary. Two, two, come on. Two you can go for it. Let's go, let's go. Good playing. Go for two, let's go for two. Faster. The partnership between Gautamand Rajinder will decide the match. Going up, okay?- Yeah. Run, run. Howzat? He blocked my way sir. Not out.- Anjali, it's cheating. Don't argue with me. Not fair sir. I am telling you not to argue. He is arguing with me. Are you mad come. Good decision. Good decision umpire. Why are you arguing with him. Come on boys. Get lost! Rajender is leading. He is very unhappy. Well played. Come here. Whatever it is.. You have to be there till the last ball, okay? Go. I am not out. Hit only lose balls. Don't take risk. Okay? That's it, keep going. GHS is really in trouble now. They have lost all their tough batsman. Only Gautam remains. Oh no. Parvez is very quick, be careful. -Okay. Varun is a good hitter but how he plays in pressure, wait and see. Great shot! He hit it great! That's another four. This is incredible. Coach. Play carefully! The wickets went crashing! They say it's a yorker. That's why one should play carefully. Like this if he had played, backfoot would've saved him. There are a billion people in India to advice. But can't find just 11 good players. Well said! GHS is in great trouble, almost staring at defeat. New batsman is Shameem. Victory of Everglades is almost decided. Another batsman is bowled, just one more wicket away from victory for Everglades. Last batsman Ashish has come to the crease. – Be careful. Can he do it? That's a cracking shot, four runs. Ashish come on. Come on Ashish. That's another nice shot. Will he be a hero? GHS needs 12 runs to win in 6 balls. Entire ground in tension and under pressure. If we don't do it, it means we've lost. you have to do it, okay? Team mates are advising bowler Imran too. 6 balls 12 runs. Catch it! Yes. It is all over for GHS. GHS is all out for 180 runs. Everglades have won with 11 runs. It's all over! ? The dream of winning championship after 15 yeas remains a dream. Sad day for Golconda High School. Its a clinical performance by Everglacier. Highest score in the tournament 191 runs, with great bowling good fielding placements, have bowled out GHS for 180 runs, special congratulations for captain of Everglades, for a century and leading the team to retain the cup with his inspiration. In few minutes, presentation ceremony.. Wait. Ladies and gentlemen, wait. I don't believe this. This is unbelievable. GHS batting is not yet over. The last batsman is coming. It's unbelievable to GHS also. Ladies and gentlemen, Siddhanth is back. How did he come back. Since doctor ruled out batting for Siddhanth after injury, GHS played with 10 players only, Siddhanth has come back to play despite injury for GHS in trouble. Come on. Come on. Will you bat really? What else Is this any fancy dress? Can you play with injured hand? The game has begun just now. I'm not going to win the match sir, Golconda High school. Siddhanth, Siddhanth. Go Siddhanth. Siddhanth, come on. Go get them buddy. Very sad. For our Golconda High school. Yes. -For Golconda High School. We must win. Let's win this. GHS needs 12 runs in 5 balls to win. That's a great shot. Come on. Gautam! Gautam! Gautam! 8 runs in 4 balls. Two runs. Gautam says 2 but brilliant fielding restricts them to 1. Come on. Okay. Okay. Take a single, let's rotate. - I'll take care of the rest. Be careful. -Okay, okay. With a bouncer he has hurt the playeragain in the same injured place. Nice bowling Imran, keep it up. Doctor. No, no. No. What can he do. He'll put another bandage. That's all, right. Did you hear this I need that medicine. Let's do it. Let's do it. Come on boys, get ready. 2 balls, 7 runs. That should be a no ball. That's a no ball. GHS need 6 runs in 2 balls. Great shot, Siddhanth. Now GHS need 2 runs in 1 ball. Go GHS. Can Siddhanth do it? Can he write History? Go GHS, go GHS. Go GHS. Oh that's a no ball. Come on Siddhanth. Run. Come on. Come on, run. Siddhanth has fallen down.. He has reached safely. But umpire hasn't taken any decision yet. GHS victory or defeat depends on his decision. Not out. Ladies and gentlemen, Golconda High.. ..School are the new interschool champions. I knew this day will come, I was just waiting for it. Hi Siddhanth. You wanted to play exchange of numbers game, right Let's play. Great show, congrats. Manisha. Manisha. Manisha. Manisha. Excuse me. Can I have your autograph? -Yes, sure. Great batting. Next Sunday is my birthday. Are you free? Yes, I am free. You must make it. Bye. M R Baig who had coached ace players like Azharuddin, VVS Laxman, is handing over the trophy to GHS captain Gautam. Boys. Shall we go? I can't show my face here any more. - Our faces were always fake. That's why we lost faces. I've sent message to chairman resigning from trust board. Still trustee, you're mistrustee, and I'm a beggar. Let's go and beg. Finally you've won. I didn't win, they won. Just look at them. They haven't just won a cricket tournament, they've won back their school, and gave me back my Golconda High school. Nobody can defeat them. Never! Let's go. -Yes.
