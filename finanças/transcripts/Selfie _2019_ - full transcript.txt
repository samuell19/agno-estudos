It's about death. Time stopped For a moment On that cold street And on the ground an angel In front of all those people Only tears God took you too soon The years might pass But you live for ever Because in my heart you are unforgettable Take the mobile. - Can you film yourself? - Yeah. - Have you used a camera before? - No. - Is it easier with a mobile? - Yes. OK. Frame yourself, however you like. If your arm gets tired, change arms. All right. My name is Alessandro Antonelli and I live in Rione Traiano. I work at the Bar Cocco which is just across the road from my house and I'm 16. What do you do in the bar? I serve coffee, I deliver orders... Are you happy living in this neighbourhood? In some ways, yes, in others, no. And tell me what are the positives and negatives? There are too many people... who're involved in crime... and I don't like those things. I like to hang out with good kids. In fact, I've only got one friend I see regularly. My friend's called Pietro. He's 16 as well, the same age as me. But he looks older, because he's taller, he's a bit bulkier. He has to shave. But he isn't. He's a bit unlucky, because he can't find work. He would like to be a barber, but... nobody wants him... I've got a job. Obviously... during the day he's got nothing to do and he comes to see me in the bar. Tell me about your friendship. DAVIDE IS ALIVE What you see on Alessandro's T-shirt is the face of Davide Bifolco. When he was killed, Davide was 16 years old. Like many others, he had quit school, and like them, he dreamt of becoming a footballer. Davide, like many others, went about on a scooter without a helmet. The way he did that night. There were three of them on that scooter. He was in the middle between two older friends. They fled, frightened by the possible consequences. They could not have imagined that they were being chased for another reason. Because Davide had been mistaken for a wanted man. In court, the policeman claimed that his gun went off by mistake. In the media it was almost as though Davide were the guilty party and not the victim. Yet Davide had never had any problems with the law. To find out more, I went to Naples, to Rione Traiano. I wanted to meet the people who had seen this tragedy close up. And there, among others, I met Alessandro and Pietro. Don't mess anything up or Mum'll be pissed off! She just finished tidying. - Further in! - I can't reach! Don't get water on the phone. Be careful. Further in! If you don't trust me, how is anyone else ever going to? Because I know you, and I know you're no good at cutting hair. I'm only doing it to thank you, because you're here with me all summer. You're keeping me company. Also because no one wanted to be with you. Yeah, yeah! My mother was really going on at me to go on holiday with her to Mondragone. I wanted to stay here. Where would you find another friend to be your guinea pig? And let you mess up their hair? Look what you've done to me... As soon as I get out of here, I'm going to a barber to get it fixed. I won't rise to your bait. Slave, will you make me a coffee? Hey, a coffee of slaps! - How do you want it? - Normal. If you'd come two or three years ago, you'd have found me thinner. I'm pretty revolting now. Oh, guys, sorry. You need to leave. I have to close. You've been here three hours. Come on! You can't film a single scene in this neighbourhood. Go to the beach. Take them and go. Bye bastards. Come and eat. You like this mobile, Patty? I'm making a film, don't muck about. How am I meant to know? I thought it was a photo. The papers wrote a lot of rubbish about Davide. Since it's a neighbourhood where there is the Camorra... A lot of people said things like, Oh, well, one less... But, no, it's one good kid less. He was an honest kid, full of life, and they took his life for no reason. It all happened in front of my house. 4 or 5 metres from my house, more or less. When we heard the shot, we rushed outside, me, my mum and the others. We saw Davide on the ground... You're showing me this video for the 300th time? But I'm doing it for your brother. The one with the car knocked us over. Suddenly he got out of the car. And I ran away, and they shot my friend who was running beside me. They shot him in the back... They killed me. I looked after my son. I work as a cleaner. I died as well. They have to bring my son back to me. Go back to the start and let's hear what the journalist says. The investigation continues into the death of Davide Bifolco, the 17-year-old killed by a policeman in Rione Traiano. Important information might also be provided by the CCTV from a pool hall a few metres from where the pursuit came to an end. In the film a group of young people... I remember it. After hearing the shot, then a policeman who runs up, pistol drawn. He's looking for one of the youths who fled and everyone can be seen in the pool hall with their hands raised. The policeman's version was, I'd taken the safety off because I thought they were armed "". There was CCTV there. The policeman went in there first. Then he went there, to see if he could find the supposed fugitive he was pursuing. But the fugitive was somewhere else all together, in his slippers in a lady's house, and he was looking for him here with his pistol. This guy fired. It was intentional. Oh, Aless√†, where are you? I have to make the sausages! Get a move on, though. Come on. All right. You see how to do it? Did you know how to? My name's Francesco, but all my friends call me Checco. I'm 19. I'm a barman. I get up at 6 in the morning to go to work. Normally, like everyone else. There are also pushers, there are those who do other things... But I'm on the right side. I'm getting tired holding this phone. Do I have to keep it like this? - Can I change hands? - On you go. I tried pushing as well, but it wasn't for me. I don't like that life. Yeah, it's easy money, but there's no point. Sooner or later you always end up in jail. Whether you're any good or not, you end up there. It's not always going to work out for you. Then, when you're a criminal, you always have two enemies, the police and the competition. To be honest, the competition is scarier than the police. The competition is scarier because they'll just kill you, while, if the police catch you pushing, you might be arrested and end up in jail. The competition doesn't think like that, they'll just kill you. In the paper, I read about friends who've been arrested, another who was killed. Come on, let me do this filming, Alessandro! Sit in my place for a bit. But, I mean it, don't tell Pietro, cos Pietro will be upset, he's jealous. In a world that no longer wants us, I'll sing even more. I put my wheel in it, I put my wheel in it! In a world where... the coffee's spilled... Come in! I got up at 6 to go to work! I've just finished. I was up early this morning, bro'. I went to do the shopping. I cleaned the bathroom, the house a bit. I changed the sheets on the bed. Help me! It's tiring, let me tell you. No way! Get the phone, go on! Men say that women don't work, but now I understand how hard it is for my mother when she's at home on her own. A housewife's work. And people say only we males bring home the bacon! It's not true, because women work as well when they're at home. Because if we had to pay someone else, it would cost three times as much. And it wouldn't be worth it. Oh, Pietro, have you turned queer? What are you on about, idiot! - What d'you want? - Were you not on a diet? Mind your own business! I'm Sara, I'm 16 and I don't like living here. Why not? It's not for me. If a boy, unfortunately, has made the wrong choices, but he still loves me, what's the problem? If he's kind to me, I don't see why I shouldn't go out with him... or even have children with him. And then if he goes to jail, that's just what was meant to be. The important thing is that he takes care of things for us. And that there's love, that's the main thing. And then if he does 10 years in jail... he'll have to get out sooner or later. And for 10 years, I won't see anyone else out of loyalty? Yeah, because I love him and I'll do what my heart says... and my head. If I have children as well. What if he gets 20 years or life? Well, that would certainly complicate things. But in any case it'll be me who put myself in that situation and I have to accept my responsibilities as well. For example, some of my friends have fathers who are in jail. And they see them once a month. What can they do? Unfortunately, the children get caught up in it, but... who can you blame? If it's written in the stars... Alessandro... You got up early this morning. It's normal to go to bed after you've eaten. Now, if I weren't a good friend, I'd come and wake you up. And I'd say to you, Are you making me eat watermelon on my own? But since you're a friend, I won't wake you. Because I respect your efforts and the fact you're tired. So I'll make the sacrifice and eat it on my own. Alessa', it's 40 degrees, brother. I'm melting. Let's do something, at least. Come on, Ale'. Have your coffee before it's cold. - It's up here, oh. - Yeah, I'm coming. The coffee's right here. Did you sleep with Spiderman? OK, I get it. Totally over-the-top in love with you You're the star that illuminates me alone If you didn't exist, I'd invent you What would I do without you? I'd stop living Unfortunately, my family suffered this severe blow... My uncle was shot and killed. They shot him in the head and now I want to avenge him. D'you understand? That's it, done. What else do I have to do? This is Beatboxing. You wanna give me a cigarette? Give us a cigarette, one for both of us? Give us a cigarette, come on, I love you. - What do we have to do now? - We have to make this video... Give me a cigarette, go on. No way, oh! - Come on, give it to us. - You're such a coward! Do you promise that if I choose you, you'll quit smoking? Yes. - Will you give us a fag now? - No, because you've been chosen. - You're awake, eh? - I'm coming. Don't push me, though, take it easy. Let's go and do some shopping... without a euro to our name! Look how nice that is. - You like it? - Great. My goodness! My goodness! What's this? My goodness! - What can you see? - My goodness, Alessa', I'm suspended! - What can you see? - I'm suspended! Is he mad? There's not even water in this bathroom! Bloody hell! WEIGH YOURSELF! - Did you weigh yourself? - Insert a coin "". I weigh... 50 kg too much. I weigh 119.7 kg, nearly 120. But you were 125 kg, you've lost a bit. He's been through a tragedy recently... Three of his cousins died on the ring road. He started overeating, he put on a lot of weight. He got diabetes as well, but he doesn't give a monkey's. He keeps eating. Sometimes I tell him, I want to give him a hand, but nothing. Stay there Where evil can no longer exist Stay there Where you walk with an angel On the clouds Without fear, the way it happened here The fault of a fate that chose me A friend... Pietro, my cousin, I don't want to steal your job, but let me film a bit. I'll introduce some of my pals. OK, but get rid of the hat, 'Pigeon'! I'll wear it backwards. - This is my brother Anthony. - Move a bit! - He's a character. - Yeah, let me play. You're a piece of shit! He owns this hall, my friend Mario. This is my brother Salvatore, but we call him 'Little Sugar', Why does everyone call you that? I don't know, because people called me that when I was a kid. This is my brother Lello, he's a character! - You're a piece of shit! - So are you! He's my brother, he's my life! Pietro, you know him already. - Your turn now. Who are you? - Me? - Nobody! - I'm not anybody! In ten minutes I smoked a pack of cigarettes. Sit down, 'Little Sugar'. Let's smoke this cigarette. - Light me up. - Here. He was a handsome bastard. You missed the best, bro'. Gran! It's Pietro. Gran! Give me a kiss. Come in. Don't worry, I'm making a film. A little further forward. Everything OK? I'm at home on my own. I deal with everything... the housework, I'm cooking. - Don't eat. - Eh? - You mustn't eat! - I mustn't eat? Am I getting too fat? I'm too fat, eh? I was at the cemetery. I'm pleased. Flowers? Yeah, I took a couple. - What's this, Gran? - Holy... - water. - Holy water? From Lourdes? It's normal, Gran, for you to be like this. Eh... normal! - Take your time. - My tongue. - Take your time. - No. You're a lioness! A lioness! What...? The doctor said you have to be patient. Oh, Pietro, you don't need to be physically beautiful. You need to have a beautiful heart. Personality. A woman wants to see character. Yeah, but a bit thinner, I always get the girl who's... Yeah, but so what? But, you know, you need... to have a lot of character. Yeah, but today girls look at the physical side as well. Yeah, OK... A slightly chubby guy's not going to... OK, you're talking about a guy who's fat, but you've got style. And that's your physique, you're robust. - Yeah, I know, but... - You'll find a girl! You, of all people, know girls are looking for thinner guys. - OK. - Who look good in a shirt. - If I put a shirt on... - But you also need character. You see more... - Oh, have you been using the sunbed? - Eh. You were asleep, brother. - I wasn't asleep. - Nooo. - I was up early this morning. - Yeah, early. I told you. I was going to the hairdresser... - You got your hair done as well? - Eh, I sorted it out a bit. What did you order? You'll see now, you idiot. - The salad - Don't disappoint him! Enjoy your meal! Wait. To your health! - Eat, eat! - This is really an insult, then! This is really an insult, then! Do you think if I used the sunbed I'd have a better chance with girls? Alessandro was holding his phone, like this... - I do it differently. - The usual gym for your arm. I do it one way, Alessandro does it in another. Every director has their own style. Pietro, I called you because I want to do another scene. A sort of Gomorrah-type scene, etc... Are we gonna do this? Oh, Pietro, do we wanna do this? If you'd been here that night when they killed Davide, I think you'd have shat yourself! The cop came in with the pistol... My goodness! His hands were shaking. He could have killed us as well. We need an ambulance in Viale Traiano. It's urgent. What happened in Viale Traiano and at what number in Viale Traiano? Policemen? This is Bifolco. I'm under house arrest. Did you shoot my brother? You pieces of shit! You pretend to be film-makers, but it's not that you're cops? - No. - Hell, no! You really look like cops. Did you read the sign that said this was for 16-year-olds? - Of course I did. - How old are you? 23. So why didn't you come 6 years ago? Explain that! When I was 16? Here, brother. What do we have to do? Talk a bit about the neighbourhood... What can I say? I don't know... Something about the neighbourhood... Here you're born that way, I wanna explain that to these cops and to the State. Rebels without a cause They call us. Born under a bad sign Nobody gives us work, fine. A marijuana leaf tattooed on my arm. But I'm still looking at the stars, thinking of a tomorrow. I think people will understand. We didn't grow up like them, who went to school, who had everything. A car, a scooter, we did everything on our own, or at least I did. I started work at 15. If I have to buy a scooter, I'll do it on my own. Pietro, quick, tell me why you wanted to shoot this scene. Look here, it looks like a boss's room. - And you're the boss? - Eh. Show me. Do something, shoot. I'll shoot you, you idiot. - You watch too much television. - Why? Why? You shoot like this? You shoot like that. - I want to shoot like this. - You don't shoot like that. - You shoot like that. - What's your problem? You don't shoot like that. Some boss! Hat's your problem? You're a boss and don't know how to shoot. - I wanna shoot like this! - What kind of boss are you? - Oh, I wanna shoot like this. - You don't know how to shoot. You just shut up. Be a director. Be a director, go on, not a boss. You're a nobody in this neighbourhood. Put on the music you were talking about. - I'm going. - I'll put it on. - Found it? - Eh. Listen to how good it is. Eh, I can't hear if you're speaking. Films in Naples always have neomelodic songs, no? Instead in our film we want classical music. Good, just for a bit of a change. - How did you find this song? - I heard it on Facebook, or YouTube... I can't remember. Shut up, listen, listen. Did you see my look? I'm photogenic, eh? Tell the truth. Wanna see how to shoot? You wanna see? I'll show you how to. Show them how you shoot, go! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! A couple of shots! Oh, the cops are coming! - Pietro! - Come on! Pietro! You wanna get on or not! Let's go! Move, Spielberg! Take a selfie. 38 with a cylinder, the Glock. The Glock fires like a machine gun, you can't stop shooting. The Kalashnikov, what can I say? The 9x21... 12 shots with explosive. My favourite is... the 375. It drives me wild, it's beautiful! What did you say? I don't want to do these scenes. We're making a beautiful film and suddenly we have to have these scenes with guns? - What have they go to do with it? - What the hell do we care? What do you mean, what the hell do we care, Pietro? You can't just have nice stuff in a documentary. Yes, but if we start with nice stuff, we'll end up with nice stuff. No, we have to start with the bad stuff, then get to the nice stuff. No, I don't like that. No, I want to talk about the good stuff... the good stuff in the neighbourhood. But we have to describe the bad as well, not just the good things. Otherwise what kind of documentary is it? People know there's good stuff and bad stuff, but you have to put this into practice. I know, but the people you've involved are only capable of causing trouble. Why? What trouble? If they didn't want to film, they wouldn't have. It was them who organised it, and expressed an opinion, and I liked that opinion. Now they want to organise everything and you and me aren't filming. Who said that? You say that? Yeah, you'll see. Idiot, come here! Idiot! Idiot! Don't hurt me. Idiot... I can take the blows... A boxer knows how to take the blows first and then attack. Enough of a lesson for you, idiot? Ye. - May I? Good evening. - Good evening. - Hi, Auntie. - Hi. The lawyers said to me, This trial is like the ant against the elephant. We're the ant, and the state's the elephant. They interfered with the evidence. They did everything they could to conceal it. They removed the cartridge. They removed the dead boy. Forensics should have come and they didn't let them... 16, unarmed, no motive, in the back. You're right to complain and be sad. Can we have the honour of... Look at all these people. Get out of the way. The police chief took off his hat... But because of this gesture, he was transferred. Because he was human, out of respect he took off his hat. Look, he's taking off his hat. You see? And because of that gesture he was transferred. Lord, why did a boy of 16 lose his life? Your brother will rise again. Your son will rise again. Yes, Lord, I know he will on the last day, but I want him now. This is an entirely understandable human desire. A desire that is born from the heart of a mum or dad. At first I felt the pain, but today, having lost a son, I don't feel any pain... I don't feel hot or cold... I've turned into... stone. Giovanni, I'm sorry to show you these images that bring back the pain of what you went through 3 years ago, but I'm doing it for Davide, to describe what really happened. Hey, Dad! I'd a strange dream last night. You'd come back to the neighbourhood, and I was bringing you a coffee, like I always do, on my scooter. But this time in my dream, the scooter was going the wrong way, like it was going in reverse. Suddenly I met Davide. He was alive and at the celebration for the Madonna dell'Arco. He stared into my eyes and smiled at me. I was really emotional, because I couldn't wait to meet you. And I wanted to say to you, See, Dad, I grew up a good boy, And I wanted to say to you as well, Dad, I missed you so much But instead, all of a sudden, I ran into a police car. I fled... I fled... my heart thumping with fear. But they threw me to the ground. I tried to get up, but one of them shot me in the heart. It was my birthday the next day. Hello? Sir, an ambulance! Viale Traiano 10! I've got a fast ambulance here... An ambulance needed in Viale Traiano. I didn't understand a word, Can you say it again? What happened? I was falling and my gun went off. Oh, Pietro! Don't show we're from the neighbourhood... These are all educated people here, aristocratic. Eh, I'll go and buy a book of etiquette! 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6... is that it? You can't do it, 6 seconds. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 9! Almost a draw! Alessa', get into the frame. Come on. We're almost there. We're here. I can't take any more. Come on, keep going! We're here! Don't think about it! Can you do it? - Oh! - Let's go. Just a little more. Come on! Wait... I can't take any more. - Come on! - I can't take any more. What? Alessandro, I can't take any more. We're almost there, oh! It's two metres! I can't do it, wait. Come on, Pietro, we're here, bro, you can rest there. Wait, Alessa'. Come on, or we'll miss the bus. You go on, don't worry, I'll come back later. What are you talking about! Come on! - I'll come slowly, you go on. - No, I'll wait for you. I'll wait for you, but move. I don't abandon my friends. I can't do it, Alessa'. Come on, you're nearly there. I don't feel well, I'm struggling. Sit down for a minute. You're all sweaty as well, bastard. Oh, I'm embarrassed to show this in the video. Come on, don't worry. I won't include it. Oh... Can you do it? Give me a smile. Can you do it? Let's go. We can do it, we're here. This fucking knee. You already look better. Here in Posillipo in the rich neighbourhood... h. Do you think... me, us, our children, our grandchildren could ever come and live here? - No, Pietro, it's impossible. - Why's it impossible? Do you know how much a house costs here? Well, you make money by working. Pietro, I'm a barman, you might become a hairdresser. How much are you gonna make? True, eh... I hadn't thought about it, you're right. Best not to think about what you don't have. Because then if you think about it and you know you don't have it, it hurts. Live And don't say you don't believe in love Because sometimes in the things you can't see You might find the hope you lost... loving Live... - What's your name? - Antonella. - How old are you? - 15. Why are you doing this audition? Because I was at home not doing anything. So I said to myself, give it a try. - Do you like Rione Traiano? - Of course. - Why do you like it? - Because I was born here. So what? I was born here as well, but I don't like it. I have reasons to like it. All right, we all do, but I'd leave if I could. I'm going to leave in the future but not yet. I won't either now, but if I have to go, I'll go. - If I get the chance. - Sure, me too. If you're going out with someone that winds up in prison, what do you do? Respect him. It's normal, respect above all else. If he gets 20 years or life, what'll you do? If he loves me and I love him, I'll respect him all my life. Of course, that's normal. In the same way I've a father who lives this life, I can have a husband as well. Of course. Make sure you cut it short, son. It's hot near the oven. Let me see what you've learned. - Why didn't you keep going? - Because of a teacher. I passed everything, but instead of a black mark, she failed me. - Really? - Eh. - Is that not everyone's excuse? - Nooo. - Sure? - No, no. Because everyone, some in one way, some in another... - Did you want to study? - Yeah, I wanted to study. Because after that stupid episode, I got fed up with studying. The usual school things... instead of encouraging children, - they demoralise them. - Yeah. But if you leave after middle school like me, how can you help your child? Not just because he's busy working... But then you might get... Dad, help me with my homework... That's a challenge! With a middle school certificate from 20 years ago... - I go away for work, Alessa'. - Eh, I know. I'm away all week, in front of an oven. - That's tough. - I know. I make all these sacrifices to... to give them a future. Him... and the two younger ones. The warrior at rest. How do you feel? Knackered. It's too hot. - I'm happy, you know? - Why? Because I think your father's proud of you. This is based on what? You can understand it from what he says. The way he treats you. I wanted to come to Giacomo Leopardi's tomb. It's near my house and it's easy to get here. They built this here, because he lived here. And I wanted to make a video message for my teacher... who got pissed off because I wouldn't learn Giacomo Leopardi's poem. All she had to do was show me some faith... I'll explain the poem now. Basically, he's standing in front of a hill, and he can't see what's on the other side. So he imagined there could have been anything. He imagined an infinity of things that might have been there. When I'm in the neighbourhood it's the same for me. I see a wall in front of me, and I don't know what's beyond it. But I can imagine an infinity of things. And if I can't see what's beyond this wall, I hope that one day... my children will. Them at least. Antonella, look out. Antonella, these are things boyfriends usually do. I'll do it for you, my daughter, because I love you. All right? Applause. A big round of applause. You're a great thing for me Something you don't even know yourself A thing I never had A good thing Looking at you I'd like to know something from you Because when I look at you like this Even if you feel you're dying Don't tell me And don't let me understand But why? Tell me Just once If you Are trembling too Tell me you love me Like I Like I Like I love you. Thanks, Dad, I love you. Believe me, it's pointless Why keep going? Me against him, you against her You promise all the time but you can't leave him What can I do? Like you... People I know charge 1,000 euros for this nonsense. I only asked you for 100 euros. I'm doing it for your film but let's get a move on. You're sure it'll disguise my voice? Yes, don't worry. I know where you live... What do you want to know? Tell me. Can you tell me how the pushing works in Rione Traiano? Don't you know how it works? You see it every day... I have to tell you? I want to hear it from you. You're wanting to know too much now! I told you I'll only speak in general, not about our fucking business here. I wanted an investigation like they have on TV. The real money, the real swindlers, they're in the middle of town. And they're fine and dandy, because Naples is simply divine. In the outskirts we live like rats. We're the labour force. They're in charge. People think of the bosses they see in films, with money, cars, Rolexes... But that's one guy. The rest are workers putting food on the table. Oh, it's like a sauna in this thing. Can we go? Do you want your children to do the same job as you? It's my birthday. You wanna wish me happy birthday? - Happy birthday, Pietro! - Thank you! Thank you. Happy birthday to Pietro! You wanna wish me happy birthday? - Happy birthday! - Thank you. Ou're welcome. Give me some light. It's such a shame this school has been abandoned. - They spent a lot of money to renovate it. - We need to turn the lights on. This way, this way. Give me some light. You know, a brother is for ever. And I want you and me to stay friends even in our old age. - Yes, it's working. - It's working! Because in the end you're my only friend. I promised you we'd be friends until... no, for ever. And you know that... I love you like a brother. And it's your birthday today. I wanted to show you it this way. - Happy birthday, best buddy! - Thank you! You're making me all emotional, bro... I wanted to give you dinner with a beautiful Brazilian, you can barely speak Italian... What would be the point? I wanted to get you a season ticket for Napoli, but you'd have to pay council tax. Impossible! Let this card be enough and I'll get you a present next year. This is a wish because you can't find a job. Light mine as well. Happy birthday! - Thank you. - You're my brother, this and more. Go! Go flat out. Oh, Alessa'! I know I said I'd have stayed with you all summer. But my uncle called me, he got a chance to go to the sea in Calabria. So I'm going. Listen, Dad... I'm sending you this video message because I wanted to tell you... I'm appearing in a film. I'm shooting it myself with this phone that the director gave me. And I think that you would be proud of me. Even if we don't talk much on the phone, hardly ever in fact... Because... phones are cold. I don't want to hear you, to be honest, I want to embrace you. Sorry, Dad.
