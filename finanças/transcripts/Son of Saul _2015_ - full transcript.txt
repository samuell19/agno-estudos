A strong man for the Sonderkommando. Have you lost your head? What? They'll kill you! Rabbi? See, Jews, that's how it goes. Take that one. What are you doing? Sonderkommando! Don't shoot him! He's a Sonderkommando. I'm a Sonderkommando too. Shut up, Jew! You're a Kommando, you dirty piece of shit! 7005. Sonderkommando. He is from the Sonderkommando. He's from the Sonderkommando. This time, it will cost you two bracelets! Come on! Oberkapo! You're going to help me give a burial to my son. Sixty seven. Sixty seven? What does that mean, you bunch of motherfuckers? Who's that one? He's another one from the crematorium. Biederman is gone. Fuck. Kapo, how come we don't have the right number? Oberscharfuhrer, we lost some men in the fire. We'll see to that. Attention... March! Why did you bring this one here? He is a rabbi. For the dead. We take care of our own dead. People come to see me for that. I did come to see you! And I did say the Kaddish. This one a rabbi? He's just a bearded thief! That's the child. I hid him. You'll tell me what to do. Saul! Where have you been all night? I was taken to the pits. And the package? The package from the woman! We need gunpowder for the explosion... I lost it. And found him instead? He will help us tomorrow. Are you choosing a rabbi for yourself from among the dead? The packet? He lost it. Jewish piece of shit! Son of a bitch. Who is this? My son. You haven't got a son. I have. I must bury him. You don't need a rabbi for that. He'll do what must be done. He stays here and you get rid of the corpse. Rabbi! Keep digging! What is that? It doesn't belong here. I don't understand. What are you saying? This is my place. Get lost! Get lost, I'm telling you! Come! Quick! - Did he make his list? - How many men? We can't wait any longer. Crematorium 2 won't lift a finger to help us. And now this. So Rabbi? This is Shabbat. You don't even know about it? - Leave him alone. - What do you want? If he really is a rabbi, he should conduct the ceremony. - We will die because of you two. - We are already dead. I must take care of my son. He is not from my wife. When was the last time you saw him? You've got no son. You! Outside! Find me a boy. Same age, same hair. You are sacrificing the living for the dead. Attention! Into the changing room! Get to work! Collect the clothes! - It was another Kommando! - The guards burned them. It was Biederman's! Rabbi! Come here, you bastard! Hurry up. You're going to fight. Move, you son of a bitch! I brought him here, from now on, you help him. Let me go. You! Rabbi! Say the Kaddish. Please. The Kaddish! Magnified and sanctified... is... be the... Don't waste time. Keep going! Only five more minutes. We must carry on. Two more kilometers through the woods. We should find members of the Home Army. They will give us weapons. We will fight. The Soviets are almost in Krakow. Otherwise, we will go to Pszczyna. They have weapons there. And food. How are you going to find them? We should just hide and wait instead. No. We must find partisans and fight.
