Well, if they are, we'll feed 'em you! Maybe they're not allowed to eat ham. Don't do that, I'm sensitive! - What do you call this place? - Probably one of the Virgin Islands. Heaven forbid! Here, take this for bait. Girls, come and get some Chester, pleeeease. Johnny, here's the charm of the South Seas: You cruise about and out of nowhere you tumble onto one of these little islands. And you'll nearly always find the natives a happy and carefree people. Yeah, I know Fond of light wines and dancing. Hey! Look! Hello, Baby, got anything on for tonight? I give you my heart's blood. They want to play. They may never have seen the glass. This water! Catchee! My hat! What else you got? Boy, I never did like a hard clock anyway. Here! I've wanted you boys to get rid of these things for a long time. Hey, wait a minute! You can't throw those things overboard! Oh, they have lots of clothes. Say, Johnny, see that little girl over there? - Here's a present for you. - Give me that! - Shark! - Shark? Shark!! Get the rifle! Submerged right there! Hey! Don't shoot him, you might hit a native! - Here! Give me a hand with this line! - Okay. Hey! Don't do that! You'll tear his leg off. Steady now! Cut him loose, quick! Do whatever you have to do, but don't pull it! What happened? When the shark took the bait, your ol' foot got caught up in the rope and over you went. How did I get out of it? The line parted between you and the shark, looks like it's been cut. Probably one of the natives. Which one? Go on, Sweetheart, I'm listening. Sardines again. - Not bad, eh? - Perfect! - I'm drunk again. - Oh! I was just tired, I know. Say, he must be the Big Medicine around here, eh, Skipper? He sure is! That 's the guy that feeds the volcano. - Feeds the volcano? - Sure! That's the way they keep the volcano quiet. He feeds it. - Throws it the fish? - No, Sir! They must be young and beautiful to please the volcano. He wants us to eat. - I can't make up my mind what I want? - Got any straws? What is this, a paper hanger's convention? All kiding aside, Skippy, what...what is this? It's poi. - Poi? - It's a poi. - Poi or girl, I wouldn't like it. - You like poi. You remember the poi your mother used to bake! Apple poi, lemon poi, rhubarb poi... Oh! That kine of poi! Well, here goes! Aw! That's good! That's beautiful, Mac! Hello there! Sure, I'm the guy. Sure! Boy, that's good! I've eaten worse than this in the Waldorf. Hey, Skipper, what is this? It's octopus. Octopus? If something crawls and stabs at you tonight, Hector, it's me!. Ooh! It's got me, I'm an octopus. Skipper, what are they sore about? How you can certainly pick 'em, that's the King's daughter. Yeah, that's all right with me. Yeah, but it isn't all right with them, she's taboo. What do you mean? Well, you see, they have rules about such things in the Islands. No one's supposed to touch her except a native prince. They're very strict about it. You're going to get your throat cut, Johnny. Well, Johnny, it looks to me that the only out is for you to run for the job of Native Prince on the democratic ticket this fall. It's funny, Mac, what the tropics'll do to a kid like Johnny. I wish they did it to me. You better keep you eye on him, Mac. He's going native. Ol' Devil Night's got 'im! Ol' Tom-Tom done stole our Johnny away. Don't you wish your were young enough to feel the way that that kid feels. That's right, Mac Not me, might keep me awake. Say, did you see the expression on Johnny's face when that witch doctor was doin' all the...? Say, what made that plant shrivel up like that, anyhow? I blew my breath on it. You little devil! I'll get even with you! You gonna let me see your face? Hey Mac, what's happened to Johnny? I can't find him... his bunk hasn't been slept in. Hey, Skipper, is Johnny on board? - I have't seen him, where is he? - What's all the ruckus? Johnny's not on the boat. What are you grinning about, Mac? Well, as a matter of fact, I had a long talk with Johnny last night. And he's decided to stay on the island and we'll pick him up on the way back. - On the Island? -Yep! Aw, you're kidding, Mac, Johnny's somewhere on this boat. No I'm not kidding and, as a matter of fact, I think it's a swell idea. I wish I'd done the same thing when I was a kid. Why, this is ridiculous! Hey, Skipper, turn around, we're going back. He'll never get out of there alive, those people are savages. - Come on Skipper, let's go back. - Come on! Turn around! We're not going back, we're going on right as we are. - Mac, are you mad? - No, I'm not mad. I think I know Johnny a little better than you fellows. Matter of fact, I'm for him 100%, and I told him so last night. So that's that! Now, don't you boys worry about Johnny, I packed his duffle bag and put in everything he'll need. Let's see...hot water bottle, bicarbonate of soda, needle and thread, a box of toothpicks, tennis racket, golf sticks, a bottle of ginger ale... Oh! And a ukulele. Hey, Brat! What are you doin' here? You're gonna cut yourself with that! Hey there, Oscar, you have my boy's shirt! What are you doing? Here, give me that! You're gonna wreck all that. Hey! What's going on around here? What? Hey, what's the big idea? My, my, my...roses! Hey, who thought this up? I don't get you, Sister. Oh, you want me to sit down. Oh! Well, all right, I'll try anything once! I don't get you, Baby. Oh, you want me to struggle with you. Never on occasions like this! Well, all right, but remember I'm only pretending! Ene-hu. Ene-hu again! Oh! Ene-hu more! Seems we have company. Come on baby.

You take a little now! See how you like it. Um! That's marvelous! Kiss me! Suppose I make you kiss me? I'll teach you to run away from me! Rain! Say! I fell like a potato bug! We can't run under these leaves every time it rains. I've go to build a house. House? Yeah! A place to live in. A shelter. You know, a place to sleep. Oh, yeah! Well, that, too! Let it rain, let it pour! Well, do you like it? Oh! Johnny! Finish house, huh? It's a palace, it's a castle. Look, Whiskers, now you have place for sleep! Hey, Nick!

No, Johnny. No! Oh, why not? Some day, Pele angry. Tom-toms call, I go. You mean to the volcano? I won't let you go. You belong to me now, see? If I not here here when Pele calls, then Pele angry. You too! Volcano curse on you. - You die, too. - Aw! Now, thats a lot of hooey! I'm not afraid of Pele and what the volcano curse can do to me. And you're not gonna be afraid either. I'm gonna take you back to civilization. We don't have any crazy, superstitious ideas about volcanoes being mad at people and putting a curse on 'em. Civilization? Where is that? Well, it's...that's not a place. That's where things are happening, people are accomplishing something. Did I tell you about the radio? Well, all you do is sit there and turn a little dial, and all of a sudden, out of the air comes sound. Right where you are. Isn't that swell? Now, look, it's getting dark. Now, if we were in San Francisco, bingo! I'd press a button..lights! Oh, Johnny, but it is so nice in the dark. Say, Luana, you certainly make civilization look silly. But it's not, really! It's great! Gee, wait 'til you see it! Market Street with all its traffic and lights. People going to theaters. Hotels with grand, tiled bathrooms... Hot water running into steaming tubs. Restaurants where they serve grand food. Parties, football games, dances. Speed boats, airplanes roaring through the air. Gee, Luana, civilization's... You're a sweet kid. Pele, Pele! Johnny Johnny! Oh, Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Luana! Luana! Luana! Luana! Luana! Luana! Johnny. Luana. Johnny! Luana! What are they gonna do to you?!? What are they gonna do to you?!?!? I make big sin, Johnny. They give me to Pele. Aw, you haven't sinned. I loved you and you loved me, that's all there is to it! But I taboo for white man, Johnny. That's not true! Oh, I caused all this. I am happy, Johnny. I happy you steal me away and we live together. I happy you teach me kiss. I happy you hold me. I happy for everything! It was best thing that ever come to me. I thought I just had a yen for ya. I thought this was only gonna be a lark! Oh, but I love you, Luana. I love you more than I've ever loved anyone. More than I COULD love anyone! Thank you very much...Johnny. What do you want? Do you understand? What do you want? Let her go! Let her go! I'll give you anything you want. Ships, knives, canoes, anything. Only, but let her go, please, please! Oh, Johnny. What is it? Whatsa matter, Luana? What did he say? Prince say now you come for me, Pele angry. Volcano curse on you! Prince say you die...too. Well, that's all right. That's sort of as it should be. No, that's wrong! I sin, Pele God He angry at me. No, Pele is no God, Luana. He's only a hole in the ground. There's only one God, Luana. Oh, God, help us. Get her out of this. It's Pele. "Our Father which art in heaven," "Hallowed be thy name." "Thy kingdom come," "Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." They're coming for us! I've got to kiss you, Luana! Try! See if you can reach me! Let her alone! Oh, do what you want to me! Let her alone! Don't shoot anymore, Skipper Wait and see what happens. Quiet! Yeah, that'll fix ya up, young fella. And don't you move that arm! That's a bad hole they put in you. Why, hello, Luana. Johnny...die? No, no, no! There is nothing to worry about. In a day or two he'll be just as good as new. No savvy, huh? Johnny...well...one...two...day. Understand? Come here, come here! Come on now, there's nothing to be afraid of. Come on, you come up on deck with me. Johnny...all right! You come on now! No. How is he, Mac? He's still feverish, but he'll put out all right. Well, Fellas, what's the verdict? Does she go with us or does she stay here? I still contend that she won't stand transplanting. You know, you take a girl that's been filled with superstition all her life, you can't suddenly adapt her to our ways. Aw, for heaven's sake, you talk like some old Aunt Emma! This is 1932! She's a swell girl and I like her! That Kipling stuff is a lot of hooey! You're wrong, Chester. That boy's whole life is wrapped up in his family. Why, if he came home with a native wife, it'd break his mother's heart! "For East is East, and West is West," "and never the twain shall meet." Mac, what's the dope on the North and South? Aw, shut up! Oh, Johnny. Pele not like you. You take me away from him. He mad. He want you die too. But I not let you. I go to Pele. He forgive...everything work right for you. Luana... - No. - Yes, Johnny. - Water. - Water. Water. ...a drink. Water. What do you want? - What do you want? - Something about Luana. Hey, Skipper, find out what he wants! Yes, Sir. It's the old chief, the girl's father, he's come for her. Well, you tell him he can't have her, that we're taking he back with us. He says that the volcano curse has been put on Johnny, and unless the girl returns with them, Johnny will die, too. My father right! I go...please. No, Luana, we're going to take you with us. No, I go go back to my people. I say goodbye to Johnny. No, Luana... We take you with us. Mac, if I had that much courage, I'd... Hey, Skipper, let's get outta here. This place is getting my goat!
