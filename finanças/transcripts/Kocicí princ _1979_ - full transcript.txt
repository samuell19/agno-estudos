- Well, hello. - Bye. Teresa, where are you? So, Teresa! Chop, chop! So hello. Watch the mirror, mom. Hey, Momma, what's up? Come on, Momma! So ... Now. Momma's pulled it off her lap and now we can go. Where is Radek? No way, is this kid gone again? Radek! Radek! - Radek! - Radek! - Radek! - Radek! - Radek! - Radek! - Radek! - Radek! Don't run off, I'd rather stay here, too. But we have to move away. I have to go to school, okay? Lisa! Come on down, Lisa, be sensible! Well, Lisa ... Lisa, you have to understand! They try to run away. Dogs are loyal to man and house cats, who are used to us. Come on. So, hop! Running off, cats are all the same. Believe me, Radek. Oh no, Lisa is definitely not. Kitty, spitty! Kitty, spitty! Look, the snow. Radek! Why did you do that, please? - Wait, Radek! - I can't hear! You just did this. As soon as you shook the ball the snow began to fall. Well, what else? I might conjure up a sled? Beware of the mirror. Hmm ... Disappeared. Really! Come on, come on. She is fabulous. I need a cat. She can catch the mice in the stables so the horses won't shy. Grandpa, when Lisa will have kittens I will give you one. - But him, don't tell him. - OK. Giddyap! - Well, here you are now? - Hello. - We are the family King. - Good gracious ... Two kids ... ... And a cat. You'll have to watch out. There are paints all around... Stop right on the spot! The lighting is under repair, You could break something. It's an old castle. I'm restoring sculptures and paintings here. Follow me. The hall of laughter. The old library. The hall of monsters. Do not! No! No, don't! No! No! Lisa, wait! Lisa! Where are you? Lisa! Come on, Lisa! Lisa! Lisa, come here. He hates cats. I need a cat. I'd give her milk, at least I wouldn't be alone. When we have kittens I will give you one. But don't tell him. Your room is upstairs, I have had a fire laid. Thank you, sir ... ... Mr? - Albert. This is a weird castle. As if enchanted. Albert, Albert certainly. He made the snow, too, and we can't get away. It's magical. Just like a fairy tale. Things are transforming. - Someone is there. - Argh! There! In the corner! It was he, transfigured. - Into the mouse, right? - And if not that? An ordinary mouse Lisa would bite in two. While waiting for kittens don't catch anything. I know. But pehaps we need to know what he's saying. - Who? - Well, him. The name you never can say. Like the prince, who walked out and said the name. But before you said Albert. Radek, don't go to school with Lisa. Teresa, bring her back! Yes, Mom! Should I go on alone now? Don't let go of her! Do you hear? Hey, be quiet, let us play. Yes indeed, I'll give her a ball and toys. Listen Teresa, you can't come along with Lisa. I have to go to school, you know? Rescue me! Rescue me! Rescue me! Rescue me ... What are you doing here? I'm dancing. Playing the puppet, I forgot to turn myself off. Please rescue me. Please, please ... If I'm rescued, I'll give you a ring. Please! - Please rescue me. - How do I escue you? You-must-pull-out the-key-from-my-back ... Please! Please, please ... And I love you! Thank you. Now you're a chicken king, you have a chicken ring. What kind of chicken ring? Why, anyway, one decorated with laying hens. - And you too, right? - I'm a girl. A chicken ring! A chicken ring! A chicken ring ... Pawsies? Pawsies! - It was your cat? - Tomcat. Pawsies? Help me. I may know who killed Pawsies. Don't cry! I have a cat at home, too! When we have kittens I'll give you one! Where are you walking, white lady? We are enchanted princesses. Three. Thank you. Welcome. You got married? - Yes. - Oh! - But we're also enchanted. - Oh ... When Radek comes back, he'll save us. Um, so yeah. Teresa, what are you doing? Nothing, nothing, Daddy. - Straighten up. - Yes, Daddy. Could you do my teeth, too? Yours are growing, but the bear's no more. And Lisa? Lisa! Aargh! Wait! Oh ... Wait, you! Aaaah ... Ouch! Once you let go of her... ...I'll kill her! Next time I'll kill her. Radek, come here! - Where's Lisa? - Perhaps she's gone to sleep. What are you wearing? What have you learned? "A" and "O" ... - Mostly I can read. - Me too. This means, for example: No entry for cats. Like in the fairy tale one was allowed in all rooms, only not in the thirteenth - Who hung this up? - Albert. Because he was furious, he painted all these. With which paints? You, Radek? He looks very like you, almost as if it were you. And next to him is Lisa. Yeah, but he has a real sword and ring. Now, everyone will work independently. Take a pencil. Radek! Three plus one equals four. One plus three equals four. four minus three equals ... - Four minus one equals three. - Three, three, three and Lisa is gone. What is it? - She's gone! - He took her, that guy! Who? Why, I said already, the name we can't say. - Where are you going? - To find her. - Now in the night? - Sssh! You saw him take her? No, no, but I'm thinking that he would ... Gone! Lisa! Hold it! Hurry! Really! Lisa! Lisa! Radek, wait! Radek! Lisa! Radek! Lisa! Radek! Radek? - Look at the kittens. - Oh ... How cute they are. This one is like Pawsies, huh? I promised Misha an all black one. And we'll give the speckled one to grandfather. Also one for the cleaning lady. Yeah, but let's keep the tabby. So yeah. - Kitty ... Where are you going again? - I gotta go to school. - Teresa! - Coming. I wanted to give the tabby bow. When I go back I'll give it to him. - Oh, you can't go to the tower by yourself! - I know. Lisa! Lisa! Where are you? Lisa! Lisa! C, d, e, f, g, a, b, c C, B, A, G, F, E, D, C- - C, d, e. .. - - What is it? Is something wrong? Lisa! I told you ... You climbed up there? Who was climbing up the tower? I kept out of there! Really! Look! Pawsies too. - She's still breathing. - Daddy ... When Albert goes away, you'll get another one. - No! - No! - No! - No! Mommy! And now to sleep. Quickly to bed, you have school tomorrow. And you, Teresa. Cats have nine lives. Good night. - Good. - Good night. Having the living water like the prince. The blood of three monsters. How he conquered on the land, in the air and in water. - In the air and water. - You better wipe your nose and sleep. Having the living water Like the prince ... Blue Prince ... Blue Prince ... Blue Prince ... Blue Prince Blue Prince ... Blue Prince. That's enough. It seems like a fairy tale. I await you, Prince. I'm no prince. I'm Radek, Grandpa, who you picked up with the sleigh, and Lisa, my cat. No, I don't recognize you. Choose! Well, take your pick! Saddle of the softest leather. And pick a horse out. Well, pick one out! This one, Grandpa. Think it over well, Prince Radoslav. Huh? I'll take this one. - This is the most beautiful of all. - Wow! - But I'll take that one there. - Sheesh. Really!

Do you have a tissue? These are nice beads. Radek, take me with you, Radek. Come on. Maybe it can fly, in fairy tales horse fly sometimes. 267 00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,805 Probably not this one. It was so small and skinny, But then suddenly was transformed. Giddyap! - And my clothes are changed, too. - So it's all clear. - What's clear? - We're in a fairy tale. Radek, give me some gum. I left it behind, there's no more. Pluck yourself an apple, and one for mommy, too. Yes indeed, it's golden. Giddyap! It's clear to me now. The tree with the golden apples. They won't pull that carrot out. Yeah, I know. - We should go over there on the road. - Okay. I. .. O. .. A. .. ALO ... Now, I know those are exactly as before. - If I went to school ... - You need to go back there. Don't ride any further. The bearded vulture live in those rocks, he carries off everything that is alive. - We're looking for him. - We must defeat him. To have living water for Lisa and her kittens. You better go back until it's time. Take this, Grandma. And what is it? I've never seen this before. It's an orange, we have no bread. This here is grassladder. Hide it well, maybe you'll need it.

The wolf will eat it anyway, come on. I can't do this. Do you have a piece of chocolate, Radek? Eek! Tada Tada tralala ... - I almost scared you, gentlemen. Finally, it's Radek and Teresa. I'm a clairevoyant and I'll tell you everything you want to know. Please. Where do we find the living water for Lisa and her kittens? From the three monsters? Of the vulture, hyena, and octopus. The vulture in the mountains awaits you. Just remember to sharpen your claws. Do you hear it? Prince Radoslav, be cautious. Thank you, gentlemen. - Please take some. - It has nuts. Hmmm ... - Thank you, Prince. - You're welcome. Radek: One, two, three, five, nine, seven. Seven! Really! - Wait here. - Okay. You scared? what should I fear? Radek! I'm scared! Smile for me! Right now? I don't have time! Radek! Watch out! Radek, hold on! I'll be with you! Aah! Hang on, Radek! - Radek! - What? The laddergrass! - This? - Yeah! Drink!

Wine for the cat prince! - What is the name of the princess? - Princess. - And what is the castle called? - Castle. Really! Don't eat anything there, drink nothing. When we get to the door, run! Catch me! Catch me! No rings! No kisses either! And saving Lisa! Shall I save Lisa and the kittens? We go on to the living water so no kissing! Kisses ... Living Water ... What kittens? What is the little girl talking about? Living Water ... kittens ... What are you thinking of? Of that girl and what she said. Just a drink. Then you'll forget everything and be happy. No! No! - No! - Radek! I know! Teresa! Teresa! Teresa! - We thank you, cat prince. - But you're welcome! - Have you seen Teresa? - Don't forget your cats! - Don't worry. Have you seen Teresa? - There she is. Teresa! Teresa! Teresa, wait! Teresa! Teresa! Wait! - Got gum? - Now? Because I am hungry! Eek! We almost stayed inside. Have you found the ring. - You have the bottle? - I do. There are still two monsters ... So I'd better get going, if we're ever home. He's dying. Radek, do something! As long as the fire burns, no reason to worry. Come on. - Don't look back. - OK. You said the three monsters. From the air, on land and in water. Now you better shut up. Then I'd like to meet the third beast as soon as possible. At least we drank. Ouch, that hurts. I hear ... ... Our clock. Radek! It's the little prince. - What does he want with the fox? - To tame it. Will he do that? We must first find the living water, before the snake bites him. Wake up! Where did you come from? Beyond here there's nothing. But you have a fishnet. I'm running away, there's nothing more here. Only a dead sea. Inhabited by a terrible octopus ... Octopus! That's what we're looking for. We have to beat him. Hmm ... Yeah beat him ... Don't worry, Grandpa, I have a sword and ring. Wait! Wait, Grandpa, let me help you! You're good, you help people. I have nothing left other than these fish scales. Take them in case you should need them. Thank you, grandfather ... hello? Disappeared. - They are certainly from a whale. - Um ... Just the same, you could lose them. Look kill the squid quickly, Whenever, we can go back. Do you think it's so easy? Whack it! Whack it! Whack it, Radek! Really make it smart! Don't fear! Whack it, Radek! Really! Radek! Radek! Radek! Radek! Radek! Rad ... Ptoo! Ptoo! Ptoo! AAAAAAA! And is it! One, two, three. - Thank you, Teresa. - You're welcome, Radek. Wait here. Save him? One, two, three. Thank you. Look, the fisherman is returning. Teresa! Thank you, - Prince Radoslav. - We thank you also for the scales. Grandpa? That's really stupid, in a fairy tale one can't talk with a lamp. - But he just vanished. - It's a fact. Come on! Hey Albert! - His name that's not spoken. - Now, yes. - Sprinkle him with living water. - Oh! All the living water! He's been transformed! It's a beautiful day today! Really! Now I've done something beautiful. Albert is white, with a white horse. That one we give to grandfather, this one to grandmother, this one to Misha, and this one we'll keep here. And one is left over. When you come by here, visit us.
