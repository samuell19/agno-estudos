This thing's broken! Sounded like he killed himself. Luddy... aren't you supposed to be getting the mail? Listen, Luddy... Young people are so untidy nowadays. - Any mail? - No... you can come back later. No... No. Noo... No. No. Nuh... yes. Thanks. - Is this all there is? - Yes... No... there's this. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Siv! - Take the mail. - Levin here... Not you, Siv!... Just a moment. Siv... it's some Japanese guy on the phone. Can you take it? - That one too. No... not the white one! Sorry? No, no. That... No, model 2B is black. I haven't said that it's white? No, I'm in a meeting. So long. Any mail? - Shouldn't you knock? - I did. You did not! And you know damned well I don't have any mail. Close the door on your way out. I'm busy. - Any mail? - Mail? If I had, I would have left it at the switch much earlier. You know that. - Do you have any? - No, but you can get me some. Those brown envelopes in the window. Very nice. - Do you have any mail? - No, I already left it. But it was saucer-shaped and went so damned... - Do you have any mail? - Yes... leave it on the table. It goes down in this direction... - I'm going this way. - See you tonight! Siv! Do you want a lift? I've got the car here. - How much is that small Chinese vase? - That's 500 kronor. -500? - Yes. - I see... thanks. - Any time. - I've decided to buy it. - Very well. Thanks for that. That's lucky. I'm just in time. They usually leave Claes 'til last. Well then... you... See you tonight... We'll have a bit of fun. - Hi! - Hi... I fixed a bit of food so you've got something inside you. I don't have time now. Did you take the vitamin tablets this morning? Yes, yes, yes... I took them! But sweetie-pie... I'm only thinking of what's best for you. Did you make an appointment with the doctor? No. You promised to. I shall... Goddamn nagging! Where are the kids? They're at Lotta's. It's her birthday. At this hour? Goddamn typical! Whenever I'm home late... I haven't seen them for 5 days. Haven't you? You know I haven't. Can't you keep track of our kids? De ?r hos Lotta. I know. You just told me. What about their homework? They haven't got much. Typical! No homework. What sort of goddamn school is it? That's not MY fault. Who's going tonight? The usual. - Not taking wives with them? - No. Dear... Don't drink so much tonight. "Did you ring the doctor? Did you take the tablets. Don't drink so much. " I'll fucking well do what I want. Goddamn prison... So frigging... You know how miserable you'll be in the morning. I know I nag. I'm... Sorry... Hammarby, eh? That shit of a place... Drunken bums, the fucking lot of them. But near where the AIK football club is. They're the sort you should stick with... Who aren't boozers. I'm telling you... if you come home rotten drunk... You'll cop a thrashing you'll never forget. Just remember that. I couldn't give a damn. And you're a great one to talk! Hugo dear, don't start nagging. Ludde is only having fun with his workmates. You stay out of it... Shut your face, you old bag! You could just let him... If I'm talking with Ludde, will you please shut up! You complain that I drink. You do. Every single day! One thing I'll say... I don't drink... I sip. Sip!... You never stop sipping... And smoking. Hi! Hi! Want to play doubles? - How the hell will he be able to sell that? - No, of course... - Any chance you could...? - Oh... yes. You coming to the party tonight? Sure... Appreciate it. A tenner here and a tenner there... - Ludde... have you met Majsan? - No. Best to stay clear for a while. What do you mean? Wasn't it you who scored her? We're calling him Blackjack. Or '21'... that'd be a cool name, too. You lot were onto her too, weren't you? You're the one she's after. The instalments are OK... 280 a month for up to 18 years. Adds up to thousands. Who are these broads? Don't put him off... he's scoring points. Two on the same spot. And one more... Very nice! Four points. Good stuff. Has anyone seen her? She can't be more than 16 or 17, can she? It was a real dump... I can promise you that. In the rockets, they blast it out. But shit goes down. What shit...? It becomes exhaust. They wash every rocket. There is not a single bacterium left. When it blasts offs, it becomes terribly hot. There's not even exhaust. They don't wash the exhaust? The crap goes to the bottom. Don't you think I know what I'm talking about? I didn't mean it like that. Of course you're right. We can still be friends... How about friends in China. They stick together. There are so damned many of them. Imagine running a place like that. I can't stand that woman's drivel! She had the nerve to say that Norin terminated its contract with our agency. I realise you don't think I should drag that all up again. But I get so pissed off when I think about it. It's insane! It's my money behind the agency. What would you be otherwise? It's your responsibility to keep me informed. About your party tonight... It's ridiculous to suggest... that all the other wives also to be included. But doesn't there have to be an exception? Is it my money, or isn't it? Would you ever have got anywhere if I hadn't stood behind you... and Daddy being on the board of the bank? Right?! My dear creature... Dear creature is it!? Is that supposed to put me in my place? "It's my money, isn't it?" What was that?! Just that it's always about money. Yes!... Quite right! Hi! Hi. What on earth... How smart you look! Do you think so? Classy! Jessica! See how smart Mummy is. What are you doing? I'm drawing. - Is Mummy looking smart today? - Yeah... super. Where are you going to? To a party. When will you be home? Around 12 o'clock. You have to look after Daddy this evening. OK... Make sure he eats properly. OK. I'll be there at 7.30, but I have to go up to my sister's. - Shan't you eat first? - No, I'll be eating there. What'll I wear? That nice yellow dress. It's rather long. It looks good. You'll be best dressed there. Isn't Daddy going too? No, he has to stay home. We'll have an ice-cream party. Kirry... come to Daddy and get some yummy. I'll put it on Daddy's bed so you can eat it when you want. Where are you, Kirry? Come on now and get some... Goddamn fucking cat! There, pussy, calm down... take it easy. Calm down... Daddy will clean it up. We'll put it her. It wasn't your fault. Calm down now, Puss. Watch out. What a cock-up! Get away! Fucking hell...! We can't have it looking like this, Puss, do you understand? That's right. It can't look like a pigsty. That's not our way, is it? No we can't ever be like that. I'm sorry... I'm not kidding you. Off you go and eat up your fish. I'll be back soon. Bye, bye! And no meowing! Hullo? Well, how are you, then? Yep... a money order came this morning. 1,000... it should have been 700 more. That's the price you pay for Claes, to get out of seeing him. No... I don't think you're a piece of shit. I just feel sorry for you. You're such a pathetic excuse for a man. I haven't time to chat any more. No... yes... 'bye. What? No, 'bye!... Goodbye! Maud... There's soft drink and fruit in the kitchen... Help yourself. Hi... how are you? Fine thanks. You look great. Are you going out? My firm's giving a party this evening. Is it at a restaurant? No... in the office. Has Mum been to see you? Yes, one day last week. We don't have much to say to each other. How are things at home? All going well. - Bosse and Jessica? - They're fine. What did they think about you?re going out? They thought it was great. Bosse took a snapshot of us. He probably thought his wife looked cute. Have done something to your hair? I went to the hairdresser and made a fright of myself. Looks cute. You think so? That's why I was late. Doesn't matter. I bought a long dress once... and went to the hairdresser. It was so nice... When I was going... Knut hugged me. That goddamned long dress... They destroy everything... Berith... I'd like you to go now. I wish you all a sincere welcome... ...all of you who contribute to our beloved agency. Tonight we celebrate for the first time in our own premises. Unfortunately, they're not quite ready yet, but these are difficult times. Like everyone, we have to spit on our hands... and get a good grip. The PR department has been doing well... Which unfortunately can't be said about the photography department. No... tonight we'll "pack up our troubles in the old kit bag"... and have a good time and fun together, and look after each other. A hearty welcome! Skol! Cinderella!... That's great. We have to... Over here! We have to welcome our guest. Lovely to have you with us! Better late than never! Look after her. When it comes to such beautiful ladies... I don't dare. Dear friends! Now that we've had enough of the culinary delights, we move on to... the next point in the evening... coffee and cognac. - Then I'll introduce you later. - OK. Where can I hang my things? There's a hook in the corner. Wow!... Don't you look good tonight! I've got something important to discuss, excuse me. What have you done to yourself. You look fabulous. Listen, Lasse... if you're in the hunt for a babe tonight put the hard word on Gunilla, the redhead in the green dress. Green pastures there! The Joker! Good evening ladies and gentlemen! May I introduce my pal, Lassie. He'll play something a bit later. He doesn't have his guitar with him now. Now for the bit that'll grab you... the high point of the evening: Handing out the packages. There are lots here. Maybe we should start with the boss. You don't have to start with me. Yes we shall... There you are! Now who have we... There's this beautiful girl here. Can I pass this little package to you There you are. Magnus! A big one for you. There you are! - There you are! - Thanks. Here's one... That's it. There you are. Here's something nice... Oh! Be careful of that it might be something fragile. - But it'll do... - There you are! It's not the fuel that's decisive. Remember when we flattened that guy so he finished up on his ear. That was fantastic. We were a real gang together. We played football and chess... - What about your buddy? - Yeah... Pralen. - You remember Pralen? - Of course. I ran into this dude on the old bridge. A real bum. He came up and said: "You got some change?" - It was Pralen. - I heard things went bad for him. It could've been the same for me if I hadn't met you. No, that's true. I was running round like a headless chicken... My life was a disaster when I ran into you. I would've gone to the dogs, Knutte. Don't be so sure about that. You might well have done better. Bullshit... I know what Knutte did for me. What would you have done without Knutte? No, Gunilla's right. We don't talk about things like that. No, look! Here's what we need. Gunilla... Nalle... No, I won't have any. Come on Nalle... it's a party. Nalle doesn't want any? "Nalle doesn't want any. " - Just how old are you? 16? -17. So this is how you're starting? Any of your concern? Any of my...? That was a goddamned stupid response. It concerns me very much. It's longhaired twits like you who'll be taking over after us... ...and paying us the pension. Do you realise that? Everyone got what they want? Yes thanks, Boss. Skol! Hope you're all having a good time. Sure... thanks, Boss. They're nice. Can it break? Typical me. Things just fall out of my hands. It was fragile, but it didn't break. That's really nice. Did you get that? That must have cost a pretty penny. No that's just junk you can buy anywhere. Let's have a look what the hell it is. Porn... no kings and queens. It's fun. I didn't think chicks went for porn. You thought wrong. Why shouldn't they? Shall have a game? Or maybe you prefer solitaire! What have you liked best? I only got here during the boss's speech. I had to see my sister in hospital. She had a nervous breakdown after her divorce. That's not uncommon. How do you like it? I should never have come. I'm only here as a duty. The guys at these sort of things become so ridiculous. Don't you think? It's been such a long time since I was out at all. Hey, Philip... Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad you came to this godforsaken country?... Instead of staying in your goddamned commie country? A regular orator! It does happen. Whoa! Is that yours or the company's? We stretch our hand to the boss of this cage He got caught with his wife on the social page! He bought a tennis racket and practised every day, Now it's in his out-tray... there it's doomed to stay! He really is a kid with clout! but oh so sweet deep down And though he has a funny look, he really is no clown! Gunilla's never ever sad... and neither is her figure... Now she's on press clippings... Sorry. Wait, we'll start again. This isn't easy. We'll start with "Gunilla" again. Gunilla's never ever sad... and neither is her figure... Now she's on press clippings, her wages must get bigger! She really is a chick with clout! but oh so sweet deep down And though she has a funny look... You just have to get a device and press a button. That can't be right. Sure it can! A shitload of voices flying around in the air. You're Mr Know-it-all. Of course there are voices. "Press a button. " No, you don't fool me. Listen, these voices are actually waves. "Everything floats. " It was an old philosopher who said it. Hey, I know a builder. He's building a breakwater. Breakwater? I'm talking about electrical waves. Breakwaters break waves in the sea. You don't have to get angry just because I'm a bit merry. She takes turns with her boyfriends... tell me who's in luck. She really is a kid with clout! but oh so sweet deep down And though she has a funny look, she really is no clown! Our Harry is sure not a dope... his brain is screwed in tight But our youngest kiddo Ludde Can't talk the lingo right. No one is forgotten, 'coz we'll sing about the rest... Like that Stickan guy who wrote this, to show that he's the best This is the gang with clout! but oh so sweet deep down And though we have a funny look, we're none of us a clown! This was just the start. There'll be more entertainment and other nice things. Now let's have fun... You look so pleased with yourself! Breakwaters have nothing to do with TV. Pushing a button's ridiculous. What do you mean. What the hell do YOU know about buttons? What do I know? Next year the whole family is coming here to Sweden. Here's our summer place. Isn't it cute? That's my husband. He looks nice. He's a lovely man. What's all this. Can't you stand up? Get in there and dance! Come on now! Later. Dance... can't you dance? God, what a corny... What's up? This thing with pictures. Why's that? Can't interest anyone but yourself. Don't say that. Have you seen that book of Fogelstr?m's with images of Stockholm at the turn of the century? Fogelstr?m? Per Anders. "Remember the City". I started on a book once, but it wasn't very good. I have them all. You can borrow it... it might get you interested. A book with pictures? Pictures of parents, children and the whole family? They can be interesting when they get old. Anyone can take pictures like that. Even you. What are you interested in, then? Music. Have you heard Hoola Bandoola? Yes. Do you like them? Yes... I really do. No way! Got to have a nose. There, it's really cute. Come on now... let's dance. No... no! Shall I? Yes. I'll show how they danced in the 1940s. You get the proper beat at the Norrland Club... Hey!... Cut it out! Wha'd' y' mean "cut it out"? Can you stand? Well, I've had a nip. You should see me when I've had three. One day something'll be invented... ...that's so damn fast that they catch up with the pictures... ...and bring them back again. Then you'll be able to show anything... Things that happened hundreds of years ago... We've worked so long together we should be on pet-name terms. I'm not suggesting anything by suggesting it. Well I'm Berith. Knotty. Have you ever thought about what time is? It's a clock that never stops. That's what measures time... but what is time itself? A second, a minute, an hour, a day, a week, a month... What the hell IS Time? If you say you don't know what Time is, I'll get really furious. Get furious just because I don't know what Time is? I can't do it... I give up. What? God, you're silly! Everyone's bumping into each other. Lovely music! You call this music? More like screeching. It's like being in an animal show... Here's Jack the Clown in a mask! Here is a heart that bleeds. Is that Shakespeare? Is he here too...? Off with the nose. Let someone else have a turn. We'll play True or False. Put on the nose and say something true. Number one: Karl Magnus Stridh. Life is hell. Come outside... Come outside yourself! Life is hell! Some have come to the vale of tears ...to provide for other poor bastards... ...and support the kind of lice called parasites! Can I borrow the nose? You'll never get to borrow the nose! Soon enough, you'll be living in some fucking suburb with kids. Then you're stuck. Would that be so bad? What do you mean? That's the way of life. That's why it's so scary. It's like when you're in a car you want to go fast. Not crawl along like a Sunday driver. But then you miss the scenery. What do you see? Green meadows and cows grazing, birds... You'll settle down... sooner or later. Take me then. Come on!... Get it out then. We can't stand here like this all night. What the hell's wrong with you? Oy, oy, oy... Poor little boy... It was so good last time... That was then. Can't it be like that now? Now a few things become clear. What do you mean? The divorce. That's fucking MY business. I think it's her business. Hey! If it's cock you want, piss off down there. It's full of it. Maybe I could help you... You can't help me with anything! So just fuck off! Two points only. Right, so there. Get out of the way! Greetings, Nalle! What are you doing? Now we're going to play. Sure... let's play. You can play here, alright. It's just for fun. Come and stand here. Now take this orange and hold it under your chin. Grip it properly. Come here Lasse! Grip it under your chin. Then you take it with your chin. It's the orange you're taking! Not so easy! Inez! Now you take it... - Have you got me now? - Yes, I've got you! Look!... She could do it! The winner! Let's see now... Who'll we pair up?... Married man, single woman... I need six of them... Don't go away! It's just for fun! Can't we have a bit of nonsense? You'll be with me! Did you see how it looked? Come on! You'll be on my team. I'm not playing any orange game! Look... you've got this on all wrong! I know how I've got it on! That's the way to have it! What the fuck do you take me for? Come on now! I'm not joining in! Fuck off!... you old slag! Take that stupid grin somewhere else. Sweaty, creepy, menopausal hags are the pits. You can't start until I say go. Go! We won! Goddamn stupid games you come up with. What's wrong now? It's idiotic. Bad loser... Should I be armed to withstand these dangers? Nalle... can I borrow your nose for a minute? What are you going to do with it? Never you mind. Can I borrow your nose? You've got a nose of your own. I know, but I want to borrow yours. Keep it, then. Can I borrow YOUR nose? Harry... What on earth's the matter with you? What is it Harry? I don't think I've ever heard you talk so much. Tell me... what are you doing with the nose? I'd like to speak some truths to you and the others here. Most of all to one... one person. But then, I can very well do it without that thing there. Now he's gone bonkers too. Fuck... I think I'll get outta here. You can talk with me for a while. You sound down... a bit off the planet. You can sit in here... it doesn't matter. Boss... sorry to bother you... it was... No, I can't wait... I just want to say what I have to say now. In the end, what is this business that you're boss of? I'll tell you... it's a business built on crap! Capitalist-crap business! That's what it is! Dedicated to ripping people off... Good speech! You didn't think Harry Sj?berg had it in him... But now you see I can. There's lots I can do you don't know. Who the fuck are you anyway? Do you know yourself? No... you wouldn't know. What were you before you married into all this? That's what you did. I know all about it! You married into power and glory! You didn't have shit! Something else... Soon it'll be us who are taking over. Yes... us. You'll be lying in the shit begging for mercy... and you won't get it.. It's too late... understand? Listen to that word and tremble. It's too LATE! God, that was good... I've wanted to say this for years. Now we can go back to being formal. Sj?berg. Art Director Stridh. You're far too beautiful to be outside the door of that piece of shit. Art Director Stridh... Sorry to disturb you in the middle of such important work. I'd like to pass on a few home truths, since I happened to be in the area. In the end... do you know who you are? Couldn't you think about moving in with her then? Moving in with her...? Hell no!... A temporary residence isn't hard to arrange. I know a woman... If I moved in with her... ...it'd all fall apart. Finish up with a screaming kid... walking around with a pram... You're just looking at the bad side of it... I don't want a kid! She can get rid of it. You mean you don't want your child to be born? My child? Damn, that's her kid. I does take two though. Kids can be really nice. Yeah, pretty damn nice... We all know what they do... piss and shit out one end... spew out the other. The kid'd be stupid, as well. Stupid?... Why? She's pretty stupid. Her kid'd be a retard... ...sitting screaming in the corner. Completely out of it. Are you also saying... ...that a kid like that ...would have less worth... ...than a so-called normal child? Absolutely!... Who the hell would want one of them? Nobody died hearing the truth... It's good for them! What do you want? You could at least say "sorry". Sorry? Yes... perhaps I should. Go now... there's a good boy. Shall we go back down? No, I'll stay here for a bit. "You could at least say sorry. " That really is the right thing. Boss...? What is it, Harry? I have to apologise... Apologise! What for? You're off to Mallorca tomorrow! That'll be nice... don't you think so? Yes, it'll be nice. Why should I have to apologise? I had no reason to. What'll we sing, Lasse? If I could get a woman's name. Berith! Berith first. Berith... So that'll be... When I came here, I came as a stranger I felt all alone, you must understand My eyes wandered round, hither and yon I just turned and there she stood at my hand Berith... Berith... She stared back at me with eyes sparkling blue Then lowered them quickly and proffered a smile I stepped up toward her, suggested a dance She melted toward me with no hint of guile. Berith... Berith... There is always someone seeking another To wipe out the past There is always someone seeking another For something to last. The dance was soon ended, as all dance tunes are... She turned round and left me... I saw her no more Where is she now, what happened to her? The questions are many... the answers come poor. Romance... Closeness... Romance... Closeness... Fantastic... terrific! Now it's my turn! What's you name then? My name's Inez. He's good. What is it? You shouldn't use so much makeup. Why not? I want to paint you. Now. Now? Yes, now... come on. We'll be frogs! Let's be frogs. Come along... come on. No, come here. No... let go! Don't be silly! Hey!... we can't do it in here! No, no, no... Buzz off! Now we'll here from a guy who can sing. Philip! Philip! Philip! Philip! Now Philip will sing in his wild native tongue. Enjoy! "Can I leave some flowers... " "Can I leave some flowers... " It is clean as it is beautiful. Take off the makeup to find the real you. Nothing artificial is beautiful. What are you laughing at? When I wash of a morning I'm like a water rat. It's not what you think. Do you know Matisse and Rembrandt? For them it's all about light. Light on the bare face. I know nothing more beautiful than a portrait of Rembrandt of an old woman. But she can't be beautiful? Oh, yes she can. Do you think beauty is the same as youth? Have a look at your real face now. What do you see? A girl who looks like ... a water rat! I want to paint you exactly as you are. Are you serious? For sure I'm serious. You must be crazy. Yes, but tighten your skirt a bit. Like that, yes! Don't start until I say. Ready? Silence! Now you just gotta bounce up and down on your bum. Go! I won! I won! First prize is a kiss from me. Well... wasn't that a great prize? They come from a culture millions of years old. Astronauts? Yep! Astronauts... the whole box and dice. Cars, airfields. There was a photo from the air over the jungle. They found an airfield, a perfect one. Overgrown, but an airfield. And right in the middle, there must have been a huge explosion. Must have been The War of the Worlds. Sorry... Were you pissing on my pants? I said I'm sorry. You should be! A big explosion. I bet you anything that's what'll happen to us. Wait... quiet down and listen. May I pose a question? How many times have most of you asked me for an advance? An pretty much all of you got it... right? But can I ask you... Something you never think about. I myself might get into that situation. I might need some money... right? But what am I supposed to do? Who can I turn to? Nobody! But I'm an embezzler you say... Are you calling me an embezzler? I've got paperwork for everything... Everything's written up. Do you know how it's done? Let's say... 900,000. You get your daddy's little eraser... ...and rub and rub and rub a little bit. And 9 becomes a 1. 100,000, yes! That's the way it's done. Nothing's what it seems to be... I can assure you of that. Drunken raving do you say? Fuckin' hell it's drunken raving! We're not alone when... "When Christmas morning gleams. " I'll just ask one think... Shall there be in any stars in my crown... ...when I shed my earthly attire? Shall there be in any stars in my crown... ...when I shed my earthly attire? Shall I enjoy just delights in my heavenly heights? People aren't happy, in the end. You do what you have to do to make a point to life. Just kidding yourself? Kidding yourself... What should anyone do then? It's strange that it's turned out as it has. Nobody believes anything anymore. The days just pass. Same thing every day... work, work, work... out in the evening... You see some people... but I don't know... And you... You'll go home and watch TV and go to bed. Is that much fun in the long run? I knew a girl once. She was with some jerk. She got pregnant and he disappeared. How would it be for her now? Do you believe in love? Not really. Are you sure? Maybe... I suppose. Peter... Skol! I've tried... to do my best... ...but nobody believes in me. Just a little printer. Come on then! Couldn't we leave and continue this somewhere else? I don't think so. Why not? It clearly has possibilities. What is it with you? You sound so sceptical, almost sarcastic. It's just I've never understood the point of events like this. Don't you like dancing cheek to cheek? Berith... come on... let's go somewhere else. What is it?... you can at least hold me... Stop that now! Hey... come on now! Take it easy. Who the fuck are you? Excuse me a minute. Karl Magnus... Calm down, now. I'm quite calm, Knutte. Quite calm. Goddamn guitar-plucker... eh? Why'd you come butting in here... you shit? You know why you're here? To play guitar! Get it?! You gonna mind your own business or shall I give you what-for? Do you know who I am? That's quite enough! Tell him just who I am. You'd better go home now... He shouldn't be here! That goddamned... Out you go! Christmas is coming. The goose is getting fat. Put our PR in the old man's hat. Lewin! Lewin! Le... Bugger me, that was fun! I gotta do it again! keep still. Majvor? Majvor? Damn, how it echoes in here! Majvor? Hell... I'll grab a couple... Do you know why drunken men always carry on like that? He didn't mean to be nasty. Just drunken ranting. It's still very unpleasant. Work day tomorrow! I don't give a shit about your work days! Can I give you a lift home, Nalle? You can drive to hell! I've got the car outside. Go outside then, damn it! I'm tired of your fucking protective instincts. You're not gonna look after me! Just go home yourself! I'm tired of your carry-on about you looking after me... ...it's a pity about Pralen and all that crap! "I took you in, else you would've gone down the drain. " What the fuck would you have been without your rich-bitch hack-journalist wife? You woulda been in the shit too! Fucking wanker! Piss off home! Goddamned... jerk! Hi there, Nalle. Go to hell...

Kissy-kiss-kiss. Aren't you finished yet? Better get a move on and get home. Just be careful you don't finish up married to the crow. Marriage and divorce... and hell in between. Hi there young dipso. You're a good guy. That's my cab, Nalle. Oh... it's you, Karl Magnus! You're pissed as a fart! Karl Magnus... I've always liked you... Of course it's your cab. 'Bye, Nalle. See you tomorrow. Karl Magnus! My honorary brother! Goddamned... You can't drive that way... it's closed off. You gotta go back. Put up your window... it's cold. Drive for Chrissake! Back! Damn, if I got hold of that fucking Hjalmar, I'd... Damnation!... I think I need a drink. A man'd give anything right now for a drink. Fucking trust it to be locked. Lewin PR... you can kiss my arse. I couldn't give a shit about that place. Hi there, boyo! The woman was lying! Can you stand up? Fucking leave me alone! Can't you stand up? Fucking let go of me! Where do you live? Farsta. I go the same way. We could share a cab. Could I get a lift to the subway? For sure... that's fine. Are you off now? Hey, Lasse... Thanks for tonight. Lot of fun! And thank you for your help. All the best!... Take care. Get well soon! 'Bye everybody! Thanks for tonight! It was a lot of f... It was right... so they use one of those bread rolls! Bang! Then it ended. Ended... The whole goddamned lot disappears. According to the exhaust muffler experts... that's what would happen. It doesn't matter what it's about... But suddenly you notice... ...that we're on the same wavelength. We sure fucking are! Mate... I really dig you. We're true friends. But think about it!... We're the last people... Maybe it's time we went. Any time now, all of this shit will be kaput! You don't believe it? You can bet your life you'll come around. All of this shit... That's all it is my friend. All this shit is what I've done... to make money. You don't think about that. "Starting here, you'll all advance... everyone should have a chance... " That's what you said to me? Yes... that you did. And I'm still down here with the shit. No wonder Karin's always saying... "You'll never get anywhere... you don't try. " Don't I know it. If I phone home at lunchtime, that's all I get. But you're taking on foreigners and shit! Shit that's risen past the post I've held for 7 years! And that bastard's been here 2 or 3. Go play your fucking orange game looking like Frankenstein. It won't get me down at all. Soon it won't matter. The same fucking office party every year. No... the gate keys Couldn't you come down and let me in? All right! As you wish. I'll find a hotel. Goodbye! We'll take plan 2... Hullo... Know who it is? Yes... Could I come up for a bit? Hell... she doesn't matter... I can handle her. I'll be right up... My little lollipop. I'm in like Flynn! Fuck it... What the fuck are you staring at? Haven't you gone to bed yet? Yes... yes!... I know I'm full. Aren't you gonna start now? Aren't you gonna start nagging? "Here he is pissed to the eyeballs... dead drunk!" I'll help you undress. You've got to come to bed. Can't I decide for myself if I want to come to bed or not? I know how sick and miserable you'll feel in the morning. Yes I fucking know that... and I know whose fault it is. Listen... do you know... Do you know that guy Willies? No. You don't know him... but I know him very well. Willies is this tiny little guy. This small. He wears a green tuxedo and a very high hat. I don't get it... You don't ever get it... you only ever gut it. Let me put it this way... Willies is the little guy we have living in our mailbox. He pops up with all the bills. So you DO know who he is... you DO know. Let's go to bed now. We can't go to bed. Willies is in my place. Willies is in my bed. Willies is lying there. Don't you understand you're married to Willies? You're not married to Karl Magnus Stridh. You're married to Karl Magnus Willies. Let's sleep now... on the stairs. Now we'll sleep on the stairs. We've never slept on the stairs. Now we'll sleep on the stairs. Like this... I'm sleeping on the stairs. You know, Willies should have a regular name like everyone else. Can't just be like "nervous". God how it spins... I gotta get up. Wait... wait... Get the fuck off me. I've been thinking. Fuck this. I can't keep on with that job anymore. I can't cope with it... physically or mentally. You'd better put something on before you catch cold. Are the kids asleep? Yes. Not many people here. What can I get you, gentlemen? Two beers, thanks. Club 69 presents a live show with Roy and Lena. Can't you take us to Farsta? My shift has finished. Just one last run? Sorry, can't do it. What's on the meter? 16 crowns. Kom, vi kan ringa uppe hos mig. Take 20.

Can I take your coat? Sound good, eh? Great. Could I get a cab for No. 4 Lars?ke Road? Nothing at all? I'll try again... thanks. Yes, rather. Did you enjoy this evening? Not particularly. You were probably too sober to enjoy that sort of party. Maud? Maud... Are you asleep? No. Is Claes? Yes. That's good... off to sleep. Good night. That was beautiful. What's up? Berith? Are you unhappy? What are you thinking about? There was some rock drawing with a guy with a big boner... ...and a girl who spread her legs. And a lot of guys who stood around and watched. You realise they were fucking for their gods. Like here... in public. What? Except we aren't exactly gods. No, the gods know that. I read that Jesus was an astronaut. Astronaut? Yes... you see... He came from space in a spaceship, and landed here. Then he pissed off back into space. The Ascension, you know... I was knocking around with this chick... Were you now? She believed Jesus was inside her. She was saved. You dated a girl who was saved? You've only yourself to blame. She only thought about fucking. That's typical... Well... the fun's all over. Would you gentlemen kindly leave. What did he say? You should leave. You've ruined the show. Ruined the show? The show ruined us. Don't make a fuss or there'll be trouble. I was going anyway. Yes, by all means. The beer was lousy. It doesn't matter... Fucking weird place. Can they have that shit? I'll call the Health Department. Fucking weird people... What'd we do wrong? You talked during the show. Who wasn't? We didn't say a word. No discussion... just go! We didn't say anything. How the hell did we end up here? Did you hear what I said to him? Spoiling the atmosphere! Maybe they were right... They've got their... But hey... We should get together some time... ...and have a real good chat? Yes... I was thinking myself... we have a lot in common. Seems so... even though we hardly say a word to each other. You could come over to my place...? V?llingby? Yes, V?llingby. We split up here. Happy Easter! Hope so. 'Bye. Hi there, my little night owl! Did you have a good time? What happened? What happened? Nothing. You know you can talk to me. My darling pet... tell me what happened. You're crying. What on earth is it? You have to tell me. I'm sorry. Has someone done something to hurt you? Have you sobered up? We've got a bit of paperwork. Take a seat. There were four of us on her. It can't be me. Do you understand? What the hell am I doing here? Wednesday... eight o'clock. Hi! Lewins PR-foto. Just a sec... he's here. Harry! Phone for you. Hullo, yes. You're at the airport? Yes, I realise you are. No, listen. I... I fell asleep here... How do you feel today? Don't ask. Good time, eh? I'll arrange another trip for us. Hi, Harry! Great party last night, eh? That was the switchgirl. I said I'd arrange another trip... It's not going to help... you?re getting worked up about it. I can't do anything about it right now. No, that's what you usually think of me. Was it a dream? It was so much fun! Don't you think? You could've damn-well taken a cab! I thought it would have been too expensive. I would have taken the last train, but I was just... too late. You could have taken a taxi from the start! What the hell made you go screw the guy? I don't know... it was like I was someone else. Are you trying to say the devil took hold of you? I was someone else all evening. You must forgive me, please! You come home after sleeping with someone else and everything's supposed to be fine. I so regret it... Why did you screw him? I said I regret it so much... Darling Bosse! Darling! You're a fucking bitch... is all I can say. And you can go to hell!... You understand that?! You're no better than a whore! What's the fucking bastard's name? You don't have to bother about him. Bother about him? When I meet the bastard, I'll belt the shit out of him! I'll cut his prick off! Some cock-artist's not getting involved with my wife... got it? Bosse... Fucking hell! What are you sitting out here for? Are you sad, Mummy? Aren't you going in? What were you and Daddy quarrelling about? Subtitles by FatPlank [RLB] for KG
