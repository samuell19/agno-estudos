Bullshit! Bullshit! Those last weeks before my 16th birthday were the most important in my whole life. I hadn't seen my father for two years. He was stuck in Poland under Martial law and we were waiting for him in London. They only let him out to go and get that medal. That was in Paris, last month. February 1984. Tony etAdam. -You play football too? -Yes. Alex was just telling me... You've been in London for two years. Why didn't you call me? I didn't want to bother anybody. I read this editorial in The Times today. Ninth of March, 1984. "The Hammer and the Cross." A Polish government minister felt compelled to deny that riot police were called to prevent a sit in protest, by hundreds of students, at the removal of crucifixes from their college. So, our school becomes a mirror of events in Warsaw. But we still have only half the volunteers we need. Please ask your friends again. Guys, come on. Let's play a game. That's my father's investment. Eleven black jerseys. He bought them for the Polls, kicking the ball in High Park. Moonlighters and dishwashers. But after the game he's gonna ask everybody to bring all their friends, to be free extra's for his show. Just because he is playing football with them. And who is he? A lousy football player. Ah! Back. Go back, I'm here to score. You just stay at the back. Take it easy. It's only a game. Christ! -Don't go for the same ball. -But... I said that was my ball. Again! Sorry. What more can I say? You lost the game for us. Do you know what I think? You're a loser. You're a loser. Hey, Genio. I want to tell you something. Actually, I want... I wanted all of you to know about my show. It's about Poland and uh, and I need your help. Sure, if they don't do it for nothing. He'll have to crawl to that man in Soho. Dino Montecurva. He's a real shit all right. Aleksander Rodak. Hmm, hmm. Still in short pants, Alex? We never thought much of you at the castle. Remember? You never like me slapping you around the face. Oh! Two pounds off a ticket for Dino Montecurva's, extravagance Mad Night. Show your ways of talent. But you never knew how to use it. You just can't put people in a Double Decker bus and drive them around, it's not theater. Cheap trick. Mind, If you go through with this show you'll become a dissident. But you never really wanted to burn your bridges, did you? -Not a bad idea. -He gave me. He offered me. $10,000 for a movie of Schoen burning. Oh! And the Polish authorities would grab a big piece of my fees, so I said, "Wait, Dino. "So long as you tell them you're paying me $3,000, it's a deal." And he only paid me 3,000. He might offer us Mad Nights for free now. For the Brady castle. Yes, yes, that's where it was. That's where I went to school. The only private boarding school for boys in the whole of Eastern Europe. And then when the Communists took over, the first step, that the dictatorship of Proletariat made was to insist on the admission of a girl. One girl, one hundred boys. Lily sto dowod. Which means Lily, one hundred percent proof. Uh, she looked like a 16 years old Jayne Mansfield. I was 14 at the time. Oh, after that school was never the same. Communist was a pretty face. Some desserts, maybe, please? No desserts. Do you have to come from behind? Well, you'll give me a um, toffee banana, please. - Yes, madam. - Mmm. May I share that with you? But Alex, that's why I asked for it. Yes, ginger and bananas. That's all you care about. If you think that you're show is of any importance, you're naive. Who cares? Don't you see that, Poland is of no interest of anyone anymore. But, we have risked that we may never see our country again. It is raining. What? - Genio, this is my wife. - Enchante,madam. I follow you. That's maybe for another life. Sorry, Mr. Genio, I was on my way to fetch the children. All right, I'll call you. She's on her way. Please... Magnificent, magnificent. - Colors...are like those in my car catalog. Sorry that I'm late. -Go on, Harry. -Okay. Uh-huh, I'll open the balcony door for you in a moment. Come on, Harry. Excellent. Excellent. She's lost over the years. Well, put flowers. Ready? Good. But not...not too tall. You are a man, it doesn't matter when you save £10,000 extra. You are going to spend twice that on everything else. Improvisation. I got the bills on your improvisation. ...it could go stable. You night of glory is going to cause me my season budget, you know. You want a little puppet show. I suggest we stop right now. Oh! Come on! That's a cheap crack, Alex! You know I want that show to be spectacular. But as you said, "Poland isn't making news front page anymore." You know that. So, if you want the money, just get it yourself, you know that. Oh! Come on! Stop! Stop! Stop! I understand that's why I need the money. Well, something seems to have escaped your attention. Well, let's forget the little things. That the car you intent to buy is not British, extremely expensive. And that you already have a considerable overdraft with us. Let's also forget that it's a metallic blue color, which caught our attention. One moment, Mr. Rodak, please. I listened very carefully to you for... ...at least six minutes. Allow me to give my opinion. After all I am an interested party too. Now, you think this car is a bargain? I don't. Because you can't afford, a bargain. It would only be of any value to you, if you were able to sell it at a profit, the same day you bought it. If you want to use it, can we afford that? Is it all about me? And for what I see here, you lead a very unstable financial life. Only three weeks ago, you asked me for a loan of £400. And what was that for, may I ask? It was for the camera, I told you about, for my son's 16th birthday. After all, I hadn't seen him for two years, now... Do you know, what does it mean not to see your children for two years? A £400 camera, for a birthday present, for a 16 year old, is not a good investment either. And now you're asking me for three and a half thousand pounds for a metallic blue car. Have you any idea, when and how you'll repay it? I told you, I am doing this show. I hope to sell it to the TV. So... I hope to be able to repay you, both for the car and... ...for the camera. You hope or you know? It all depends, if I am able... If this, uh... It depends on me, Mr. Rodak. When you find out, I'm willing to listen. Even to people who buy £400 birthday presents on overdraft. Happy birthday. I could bunk up school in a couple of hours. With a little luck sell this crap somewhere. Ha! Sucker! Talking to me? Lousy birthday to you. Get up, monkey. You ain't telling me, what to do. Even on your birthday, Adam. Good morning. Adam... Hurry up! You're late again! All right, fick-head. - You, shit... - Go away! Piss off! Go away! Piss off! Piss off! Stop it or I'll smash you against the wall. Funny! Another bowl. Goodbye, Mum. We won't see each other for a long time. Only one fish finger left in Poland. Shut your trap, Mallett. You shut your mouth until you're told to open it, you Polish wog. Don't let him get to you. He doesn't bother me. -You got your physics book? -Yeah, sure. -You can keep it. -Huh? My rubbish bin is full of physics books. Well, the Second World War was nearly over. The allies had to agree on what should happen to Europe. Britain, the United States and Russia, all wanted to protect their own interests. So, they started to negotiate the boundaries, which would mark their spheres of influence. Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt met in Yalta, while Russian tanks were already deep inside Poland. The line dividing Europe was established at this conference. Hey rat bag, how does a Polish hero under a Russian tank? Trying to be funny? Like a squashed pancake. Sounds more like you, locked in Northern Ireland. You... You, there! Stop it at once! Get along, there. And, you! Don't want to hear excuses. You're trouble. You're all trouble. Shit. I'm a sitting duck in this blazer. In this country, any cop would take you straight back to school. Better stick it where it belongs. I should paint a zigzag on my face, and dye my hair pink. Then, I'll throw my passport on the officer's desk. That's mum's nicest picture. Is that you, Mrs. Roster? Hello? Yeah? I'll be with you in a minute. All right. Listen, what I want is to swap this for a Walkman. Ah. Yeah, you've come to the right place, my son. Yeah, but I also need 120 Pounds. Come to the counter, please. I want to pick up a ticket for Warsaw. Er, I booked it last week. What's your name, sir? 230 Pound return? No, one way, please. Confirmed on the 4:30 flight. Hey, I want to talk to you. Really? All right, I'll come. It's all right, you know. Well, you're going right? -See you later. -I told you I won't. I'll meet you in the street, okay? The damn thing doesn't work. Hey, hey! Don't mess with the machine, boy. -It doesn't work, man. -Come on, Adam, let's get out of here. Well, you get out. Go on. See what I mean? This doesn't work. Shit. Hey! Just leave the machine, All right. Okay. You can stop the tape any way you want. But, I can't be stopped that easily. You won't see the zigzag on my face. Because, that is going to be for real. Britain has reported to have said is fast becoming a paramilitary state ...in the Nottinghamshire area have been closed down. If you must shout, do it in English. -At least, you will get some practice. -Okay. You wish to hear it? All right, I'll tell you. You left me here, on my own, with those two impulsive monsters who'll grow into some kind of cosmopolitan idiots. I feel so lost about it, that I'm like a country full of nothing. How can I pass an exam in English, if I can't even think in Polish! Make it a habit of Jack knows. Until you arrived, cool and bloody self-possessed and you dare to patronize me. Yes, I know. Yes, I know. He said, he's going. Hey, hey! When was the last time you beat me? Warm. Warm. Warmer. Warmer. Hot! Ah, good morning, guv, I've come to vend the partition. -Mrs. Fontaines'... -Ah, yes, of course. Come in. What is she doing to my kitchen? It's part of my salary. Can I help? Ah, no, sir. Hey, er, where do you want this partition in? Er, over here. By the kitchen. Ah, put it there. -Now bring in the big stuff. -All the stuff? Yeah, right. You know, the real problem I've got, is the roof. The council wants me to make it a couple of inches shorter. Ah, you need a proper builder to do that, guv. Wrote you off, John. - Let that in? - Yeah. No, no, I kick and slip! You just can't do that. No, no. You think I did it, son? I've been playing this game now for 40 years. I know what I'm doing. -It's a foul! -Anyway, I don't want to talk about this, so... Piss off. Piss off, eh! Ah, you and your theories. What's wrong with him, eh? Oi! What do you think you're doing? Momma... - Don't just stand there, go in the street! - PC Albert, 143. - Get that beast! Incident involving pedestrian and motorist on Prince Consort Road. Get the beast! Get him, get him! Well, you haven't answered any of our letters or our calls, Mr. Rodak. I think it's fair to say, that you've deliberately avoided all our attempts of making contact. No, I would never do that. You even pretended to be out, when my colleague here, made a personal call to inspect your property. Do you deny that? I wasn't enticed, personally. It's a foot longer than on your plans. It's an insult to my department, to British Architecture. This is a listed building, grade two. What about my neighbor's extension? That was done before December 1, 1981. Ugh. I realize your interest in keeping the house in its original state, Mr. Rodak. But, you must realize, that the horses were kept on the first floor of these houses. Such a practice is no longer desirable. Please, use the bathroom. You have one week to fix your roof. If you don't, I'll have the worker men to take it off. At your expense. It's all lies. He kicked my car. - Which was red. - Not orange. Now would the defendant keep quiet. Will the defendant kindly sit down. When I got out to see what was happening, the man assaulted me. Sit down please. Will the defendant please sit down! And the woman, hit me on the head! Next witness. Mrs. Rodak, please. Hmm. I swear by Almighty God, that the evidence I shall give, shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. You are Mrs. Alicia Rodak of 2 Canning Place, London W8? Yes. Court 5, West Metropolitan, Police v/s Keech. Did you see the defendant strike your husband, Mrs. Rodak? Yes. He hit me, as well. In what way, Mrs. Rodak? Um... He grabbed my breast and twisted it. Could you, er... Could you describe that action more particularly? What do you mean? Er, this way or that? This. This way. Mr. Rodak, please. Mr. Rodak. Partners in the case of Willing. -Mr. Willing? -Yes. - Mrs. Willing? - Yes. Good, yes. Mr. and Mrs. Willing to Court 2. Thank you. I would like to apologize, for kicking the red car's bumper. Orange! Red, huh? Yes, red. I did it in anger when I feared for my family's safety. However, when the driver got out, I knew that my fault was double. Are you giving evidence for the defense or the prosecution, Mr. Rodak? I am trying to be objective. Mr. Banghali probably thinks that my attack was not only on the bumper of his car, but, also, on the color of his skin. Would you kick a white man's car, with no scruples, whatsoever? I swear by Almighty God, I will never kick another bumper. Thank you, Mr. Rodak. Now, Mr. Banghali, I'm going to dismiss the charge of grievous bodily harm. However, I find you guilty of common assault, a charge for which you can go to prison for up to eight months. I will give you that sentence, suspended for one year. And you, Mr. Rodak, will you please refrain from kicking people's bumpers in the future? Regardless of the color of the car, or the driver. Please, it will be easier, this way. So, you are in. For God's sake, Mr. Rodak promised us an interview. Breakfast TV would be great publicity, for this show. Darling, I've been told, I don't understand what this show's about. You'll have to wait for the maestro to arrive. After all, it's a final rehearsal. That's another thing we can film. We've got all these extras at your disposal, darling. Aren't they good enough? You might as well do something with them. Could you? Oh, the violence of TV. It's all you people are ever after. Okay, gentlemen, let's get on with it! One for the camera. Wonderful darling. Wonderful. Tell Mr. Rodak, we know all about television rights. We quit. We for solidarity, not for television. Where do you think you're going... Keep rolling Charles! -Just... Would you... -Stop! -Keep rolling, Charles. -Stop, stop! You get down from there, would you? Get down! Go on. - Get out! Go on. - Get out of here! Go on, get out of here! - Quick, pass us more tape! - Okay. Get all the stuff over there, all right. Don't worry, then you miss the last rehearsal. Where the hell were you? Don't you give a damn of your show? On my theater! Maybe you have forgotten, there is a performance tomorrow, Mr. Rodak. Tomorrow, I think you forgot? We're all here! And you where, where are you? In Poland? When you were... You better go with me, I'll fix it now. Well... Can you fix as well £10,000? Because, you'll have to bring them back. And you need £20 at least. Each! Stop screaming in the window, you come with me now. Look, I'm not screaming. Genio was really the man in command, see. Could you tell me where is Genio, I believe he works here in the kitchen? Of course Table for one, sir. -Here... -No, no, you, uh... You...You don't understand. Genio, kitchen worker. Genio? ...all together, once again. One of those historical moments is being carried and watched out, it's a great pity but there we are, keeping you up to date on what's actually happening. Ah, hello. Please, Genio... -Washer. -You bloody English spy! Look mate, I can't even pronounce most of the blokes' names that work here, let alone remember them all. So you asked for his job then? Alex, I found him. Genio, Genio. - Speak to him, will you? And sober him up. Ask him to help. Where are you... What about the show, you've forgotten the show, we need you. He needs me, not me. Oh, thank you. Never mind, never mind. Have a drink. Hey, Bacho! Polish for police arrest. Look, we need you. We need your people. MonsieurRodak will pay you. He will give £20 to everyone who comes tomorrow. -When? -Tomorrow. Here I have job. Size room. Kitchen and all. Well.... -But my wife is alone. -Oh! This is your wife? Shoes. -It's very nice. -You want it? -Looks better, I sent... -Beer everywhere Him, her. Cosmetics are £80. She looks very nice. After... No letter, eight months! Look, come tomorrow, he will give you £20. He's promised Maybe. Bring the rest of the vouchers. For all the time... When I asked you to participate in this happening. I thought It would be... A foolish patriotic manifestation for all of us. Now, you want money for it. Okay. I promised you £20 each, but the money... just is not here, I have to go out and get it. So, this... This is what I can offer you, now! Personal vouchers for £20 each. Okay, he's asked me to go with him. He said, he'd get the money even if he had to break that man's neck. I can be useful then, I guess. Still, It takes some nerve talking to a man like that about their show. Or they call it theater. Sitting the audience in buses to watch a bunch of unpaid anarchists. They call it political. All that will happen is, Dad will not be able to go back to Poland. It's as funny as that. I'm too rich to be ambitious. Take that out of here, come on. Here. Thank you. No, it's for the bitch, Alex. Ah. Ah, Samuel. It's a nice name, for a boy. So Dino, you finally made it. Poor kid. You know, when you finally cough yourself to death in, uh, six months. Six years? Well, who'll be around to protect him? Your bodyguard? Well, my boys, they are capable of looking after me when I'm too old for this type of business. You have two? The other one's even bigger. I've been told that you're desperate for £10,000. So, here's what we'll do. Leave me three invitations. Three. Mmm. I never did like this caresses of yours, don't do it to me. Alex, why don't you do a show for me for... £100,000. And we can tell the authorities it's only 30,000. Didn't he say that man was a shit? Well, you know... So, it's all about money, isn't it? While you insist, things are not, uh, always as they seem to be. I don't want to hear about that! Hello, is that Valentino the hair dressers? Yeah, my mother, Mrs. Rodak is on her way. Oh, well, don't disturb her, could you tell her please, there is a letter on my father's desk Ask her to pick it up for him, before the show. Ladies and gentleman flight will take two hours and twenty minutes. It is snowing in Warsaw and it is 15 degrees below zero. Please return to your seats. Fasten your seatbelts and observe the no smoking sign. Thank you. Have you seen my husband? Where is he? Oh, show has already started ma'am, take your seat. Four England players waiting, but to no avail. That should be Hodge's ball and he's lost it. The docker is inside McFarland, Hughes trying to get back to the goal. Number ten, Domarski coming up square! And it's a goal! England should have made that challenge, and he didn't. And Domarski has scored! Lato has kept his head very well to lay the ball back on for Domarski. And the shot went in under Shilton's dive. And England are in terrible trouble. Their defense was caught exposed. A vital tackle had to be made until the moment it went wrong England was chasing back, too late. One nil to the Poles and England now have to score twice to stay in the game. So, it looks as if the Poles have finally dashed England's hopes. But who gives a shit about Poland anyway? Poverty makes you look the other way and tyranny makes us all nervous. Football has made Britain aware of Poland for the first time. It's not fun being beaten, is it? Quite an ordeal. In 1945, Hitler ate himself up. Europe was starving. But the big three sat down for a feast. At the Yalta Conference dinner Europe was served, and they all tucked in. Poland was the dessert. While Churchill preferred a cigar. Roosevelt was sick. But Stalin asked for more. So, he swallowed them all by himself. The Poles have done it again, they have taken the world by surprise, once more! Who's going to teach them a lesson this time? Everybody! -Here we cut such hair. -I've got my own scissors. You banned them Alex, you banned them all right. Give a £20 note to the man on each side of you. And tell him to set fire to his voucher. Yes, sir. Keep one for yourself. I'm going to save you a lot of money, Alex. You're going to tell them to stop? Tell them to stop, Alex. Tell them to stop, Alex. Alex, Alex, look at this! No more substitutes, I want real friends, real enemies. I want to go to a real church. I want to go to Warsaw Cathedral. I want to take my own risk and not be afraid. I had enough for playing for losing teams. I want to play for Poland and help them win. So long, Dad.
