Although I love chatting with friends... fooling around, I'm only sad in my songs, see? Who speaks, doesn't lie Brave men always die at the hands of the weak Who speaks, doesn't lie Brave men always die at the hands of the weak I'm from Brancura's time When the weak sent the strong to their graves Who speaks, doesn't lie Brave men always die at the hands of the weak Who speaks, doesn't lie Brave men always die... They're things I've lived through, like a samba I wrote... called "Dona Carola". She used to look out for everyone. So Dona Carola said to me: "Nelson, you're in a bad situation... I'll sort it out for you." So that's one of the songs... this song here, right? I got out of bed quite unable No one's been to see me yet I had friends while I had money Now I've no company Now people avoid me, but no matter Friends only take my capital If it weren't for Augusta and Carola I'd leave hospital in a nightgown The trucks full of corpses, I remember that in 1918... I was born in 1910, so those trucks piled with corpses... I wondered what it was all about, I was still a boy, 8 years old... watching those trucks passing, lived on Rua Joaquim Silva... I was born on Rua Marinho de Barro. I said... although carefully, because family... which was a large one, back then uncle played violin... he was my violin teacher, but luckily my mother was a... washerwoman for the Santa Tereza convent... so she'd bring food for us in the afternoon. She was a washerwoman, my old man had an instrument called... a double bass, which after a while we started taking down... we started taking down... to the docks, so that was the instrument we started out with. We used to play it during carnival, me and my brothers... and later we said, this is no good, so we started selling... parts of the instrument, in the end we got rid of everything. Of my sons the youngest is the worst Took after his dad, he's just like me He's got his eye on the next door neighbor's little daughter. In the long run I think he'll be trouble Writing a samba for him is easy He's five years old All he says is: Dad get me a woman I'm worried about the way the brat acts When he passes a young woman he winks If I go to the barber's He wants to shave too Says he supports Vasco and he even wants to smoke cigars He greets everyone How he loves a guitar He's convinced Teresinha is hitting on him Of my sons the youngest is... That's nice, isn't it? That's it! Now, the most sincere samba song I wrote is the one . I already sang for you. I can't refuse alms To those begging for charity I always pity those in need Although I sometimes suffer ingratitude I'll always help those asking for bread I could never avoid doing good For I might be in need too I know that my greatest inheritance in life Is my heart, friend of the afflicted I know I lose nothing by thinking this way Since I don't know what will become of me tomorrow Get your smile out of my way I want to pass with my pain To you I am now a thorn Thorns don't hurt flowers I just erred in joining my soul to yours The sun can't live near the moon It's better that way, right? Because singing something now, just because of that problem with my nephew you know how it is. You forget them. And for me to remember a song he wrote a long time ago... it's very tough on me, I'm still hurt, you know? Not like the other days. The joy, things like that, right? So I think you should... then you think of a description. Things like that, isn't that right? You'd better think it over, Gilberto's been so mad at me. Right, Missinho? Missinho's here. So Missinho can suffer along with me, he suffers, but he knows... how to suffer, he's worse than an old woman, you bet. Everyone's moving on. Like me, waiting my turn... but I'm not leaving just yet, still going to eat... plenty of oxtail stew and potatoes, for sure. From dust you came and dust will become Everything on this planet is undone Don't smile at another's misfortune For your punishment will come too You live like a don, keep your wealth Leave the poverty to me I consider myself rich in being poor Somehow I've always known how to be noble You have a heart of stone, which I pity From dust you came and dust will become You live like a don Keep your wealth Leave the poverty to me When I pass Near the flowers They almost say: Walk on, tomorrow we'll decorate your end When I pass When I pass They almost say: Walk on, tomorrow we'll decorate your end I'm leaving, I may not be back You don't wish me ill Today is carnival I'll go far away Don't you worry I'll only return home When carnival is over, over I'm leaving, I may not be back You don't wish me ill Today is carnival
