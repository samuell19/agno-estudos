With the financial support from the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation THE BOTTOMLESS BAG Based upon Ryunosuke Akutagawa's story IN THE WOODS Madame, after the grand duchess death the duke is continuously grim. Please don?t scare him too much. One-two murders, not more. I?m all ears, Your Excellency. - I would like to discuss some details. Je voudrais parler avec vous, alors asseyez-vous, Madame Asseyez-vous. Madame, how much do you charge for reading Your honorarium Your Excellency, its 50 rubles as with everyone else. The previous readeress took extra money for every extra murder. Then she fancied to sink a ship. And because of a shipwreck and hundreds of victims she charged 50 for every dead soul. Naturally, I refused to and simply turned her away. Don?t worry, Your Excellency. It?s just a usual honorarium and only one single murder. - I am satisfied. - Wonderful. Just wonderful. Madame, are you German Why on earth German, Your Excellency Everything is too neatly arranged. Well, I?m just trying to subdue my inner chaos. Methinks you know what I mean. You must be familiar with such things. To arrange hidden bottles by their color and size, like all alcoholics do. - Go on. - I can see everything. I can see a massive book cabinet behind the wall. On the third upper shelf, behind the encyclopedia, the bottles are hidden. They are accurately arranged according to their size and color, like soldiers Go on, Madam! There are seven of them Pray, go on, Madam! Each one is smaller than the previous one. Two are uncorked. The smallest and the last one is half empty. - And what color is it - Black. - Bravo. - The year 1866. Xeres. Bravo, Madame! You are ten-heads clever! Divine a dream... A disquieting one... On awakening, it?s this tense, sensation in my heads crown. A peg to hang your divination on Birds were beating against the window pane. One of them flew in and was all aflutter near the ceiling. How many birds it was? Your Excellency - Methinks, two, two and a half. - Be more precise. What color? - What color? - Yes. - The two birds were... Grey. - Specify - what shade of Grey Almost transparent. Then calm down, Your Excellency. You have no reason to get worried. Because transparent birds mean pickling of mushrooms. Bravo, Madame. He?s that very robber I failed to catch last time. Only back then he was a total ragamuffin. But now he has a bow, a horse with a rich harness and a sword! As it this man that I killed? Last afternoon I met in the woods a man and a woman. The woman looked back at me and it decided everything. I killed that man, but I didn't kill that woman. And the robber narrated his story. When that woman looked back, I liked her that very instant. I decided to possess her and began thinking how to cheat them into turning their horse... It hurts! back into the wood. And he told them how he found a treasure not far away and if anyone would wish it, he would sell cheap ancient mirrors. They believed him and urged their horse into the woods. The prince hurriedly followed the robber, heeding his story, and the princess stayed waiting on the glade. The robber attacked him from behind, fell him on the ground and tied him up to the tree. What about a rope There is no robber without a rope. On seeing her husband tied up. To the tree, The woman pulled down her attire and grabbed the weapon You will be mine all the same. You will be mine, said the robber. Never before had I met such a brave woman. I would dodge and duck, but she would brandish her sword, right and left and everywhere. But it?s not for nothing that I am a great robber. Madame, I fancy picking mushrooms in the woods. But I understand nothing Whether it?s an edible one or a death angel. - And nevertheless, you go mushroom hunting And when we enter the woods, I wander away, find the most beautiful mushrooms, shower them with kisses and throw them away. Kill him! - What do I do with her Kill her? - Kill him! - Or pardon her. Tell me. - Kill him. Just nod your head, hey, you. What do I do with this woman? Shouted out the robber. What do I do with this woman? Shall I kill her? - Shall I kill her? Have mercy on her - Have mercy on her Just nod your head, and I will kill her. I was disgraced! - shouted out the woman. One of you should die. Shall I kill her or not? Come on, just nod your head. Hey, you, what do I do with her? you that should die or him. One of you should die. And I will stay with the one alive. So the old man went a-hunting. Only he didn?t, bring any tangible matter. Except a fairytale. A fairytale with a very bad ending. Kill him! Kill him! And what happened to the woman Where is she? You may subject me to a most vicious torture. I always knew that my head would be impaled. What happened to the woman? - What happened to the woman? I don?t know... I don?t know earnestly. One won't even see it in a nightmare that the prince will see such a sad ending. Indeed, human life vanishes in one instance. And yet you believe in transfiguration I personally heard a lot of life stories about it. One ancient Greek man wrote how he was a boy, and then a girl, and then a branch, and then a bird, and then a fish which for some reason was suffocating in water. One poet described even more wonderful versions of such life. He was a sword in a general?s hands, he was a streetlamp on the bridge... On the bridge When I happen to pass a bedraggled neighborhood in Petersburg, I see a dog there on the bridge, she?s lame. People must have been stubbing out cigarettes against her, those stubs are entangled in her fur. She is shivering, looking at me with those lusterless blue eyes of hers. And she is crying. Madame, and it seems to me she is my mother the grand duchess. I once read about people who turned for 100 days into the sea foam or a book. But to turn into a dog, on the bridge in a proletarian district the abode of drunks The grand duchess Yes. Your mother is a dog. But not the one you told me about. Are you sure you are not mistaken? What the devil for your dear mother the grand duchess would fare in this city. After so many years in Petersburg I still can?t get used to its coldness, slush and continuous dusk. Besides, the city rests on human bones... No. Your dear mother is a dog. But she is definitely somewhere in the south. Maybe in Crimea, or even in Italy - in some blessed corner where it is so warm, and the air and the trees are so heavenly. Or, maybe, she is in Naples, where everyone is in love, where all men have continuous erection. But where has that woman disappeared I can see her. It?s a woman... She came to a forest hermit in the princess apparel. She says she had killed her husband. She wants to confess how it happened. How she took a bow and sent an arrow right into his heart. Raised myself from the grass with difficulty, and look into his eyes intently. His gaze had not changed at all, still bespeaking that cold contempt and that disgusting hatred. I don?t know how to describe what I felt at that moment: it was sadness, shame and anger... The woman told the secrets that she saw indescribable anger and decided to kill him. Hardly suppressing the emotions from which my bosom was nearly bursting, I... began to look for his bow. I picked up the bow, the arrows and calmly told to the prince Now I?m going to take your life and will follow you immediately. On hearing my words. The prince made an effort to move his lips but he wasn?t able to utter a word. His mouth was sealed. And then I looked at his lips closely. And I understood everything. He meant to say only this: Kill me! It defies any words how woeful it all How can one bear through all this? That?s why day can?t last for long that?s why it longs to hide, to go away and to come to an end. And it takes away with itself all harm done, all grief, all human pain... And in its stead, there comes the night darkness: it disperses everything and distinguishes everything, putting an end to all sins committed in the daytime, making everything invisible, so that everything stops existing for some time. At that moment I again lost my consciousness. When I came to, the prince who was tied to the tree, breathed nevermore. The arrow got him right into his heart. The setting sun shone over his pallid face: stifling my sobs I undid the ropes. And after that... What happened to me after that? - She'll drown herself! - No, she won?t. Do you remember that story from Sheherazades Arabian Nights Fairytale number 295 about the bottomless bag? The one who spins more words, wins. Let?s make a bet! So, let me begin. Very well then. Oh, Ruler of the faithful ones, in so-and-so year I left my home city... that is Baghdad... and I carried with me but a small bag. In a so-and-so town I was purchasing and selling items at the market. All of a sudden, a rascally Kurd grabbed my bag from me and said: This bag and all its contents are most certainly mine. So we went to the magistrate, and he said to that villain... and he said to that villain: If the bag is your property, as you claim, then describe to me its contents. And the villain said: This bag contains two silver needles, a handkerchief, two gilded pots, two chandeliers, two carpets, two jars, a tray, two basins, a cauldron, two mugs, a ladle, two nosebags, a cat, two dogs, and also, a plate, a kaftan, two fur coats, a cow, two calves, a she-goat, two lambs, a sheep, two green tents, a he-camel and two she-camels, a buffalo and a couple of bulls, a she-lion, a she-bear, two foxes, a stool, a palace and two gazebos, and also two castrated cockerels, two chambers and the kitchen and two kitchen workers who will testify that this bag is mine! I was so amazed by the Kurds tall tale and said: And I only have in this a dilapidated house and a small hut with no door, and also a dog?s kernel and children?s school, some tents and tropes, the cities of Basra and Baghdad, blacksmith forge, a fishing net, Sherzads palace, and lads and lassies and one thousand of whoremasters who will testify And this junction the villain sobbed and cried out: Your Honor! This bag is familiar to me. Transmit it contains fortifications and fortresses! the Grams and Hons and people playing chess: a mare and two colts, a stallion and two horses, and also one city, two villages, and one whore and two lads relaxed by her, and aim the judge and two witnesses who will testify that this bag is mine! I was nearly stumped at this and said: No! In this bag there is a whore and three lads relaxed by her, and also coats of mail, daggers, armories, a thousand of butting rams, a thousand of barking dogs, the beautiful brides and rich grooms, the weddings, the humdrum, joyful shoots, dose brothers and faithful friends, cages for eagles, tambourines and pipes, fifty Persian girls, twenty Georgian ones, two lame lassies and three Indian beauties. An old woman with a cracked mug, the Tigris and the Euphrates a fire striker, a flint, a piece of wood, a nail, a black Arab with a flute, a tilt yard, mosques, caravanserais, bath houses, a mason, a carpenter, a master and his subordinate, a lot of cities, and one hundred thousand dinars, twenty chests with silk and gauze cloth, the land as far as Assuan, the palace of Prince Khosrov, Samarkand, Isphahan and my underwear, an old woman with her mug glued together and a thousand of sharp razors to shave off the magistrate?s beard if he dares to say that this bag is not mine On hearing these words, the magistrate felt puzzled, and he exclaimed: Both of you are scoundrels! I swear by Allah Himself! From China to the nearby village, from the land of Iran to the land of Soudan, from the valley of Namang to the land of Khurasan you can?t put inside the bag all that you described. Can it be like the sea that has no bottom? Or maybe it is like The Judgment Day which will gather all sinners and the pious ones? Having said this, the magistrate ordained: Open the bag! And the man opened his bag. And inside it there was only one lemon. And he threw the bag at the villain?s feet and left. You have won. She won?t drown herself. The Mushroom says the princess is going to drown herself. The Mushroom said the princess didn?t drown herself but ascended. I decided not to die. So I stayed alive, but I have no reason to be proud of this. It means The Holy Mother has turned away from me, a useless one. What do I do now? After killing my husband, after being wronged by a robber, what do I do now Tear away your anger and be at peace. Don?t take into your head all evil and vicious things. Isn?t the best thing to do is to leave everyone be with their good and evil, and just sit in the company with the beaming ones. Your Excellency, have you - ever been in love - Yes. I once caught a mermaid. We lived nicely until I took to bottle. After this she swam away. - And are you in love, Madame - No. My age it defies things aesthetic. Madame, and what do you think about these bottles They look like young women. They are clinging to each other. They feel cold and lonely... For once they were in love, too. They live in a province, so full of dreams. Dreaming to leave to Moscow. To Moscow. No, this dream will never tee fulfilled, and it will remain just a dream. They will never leave anywhere. They will feel blue, suffering. It will be only their chores left for them. They will grow old, and their mind will become stiff. We are imagining things. Imagination is better than reality. Without fairytales, how would we protect ourselves from life Moscow is so far away... far away... Such exquisite life is what provincial artillery officers are dreaming about, too. But history is growing darker and darker. There is nowhere they can run away. Madame, what do you think...? You are asking about this lonely bottle? Its Catherine: she?s standing on a high cliff, she?s about to jump into the Volga Are you sure? The Volga is a great Russian river. She will perish. Death is imminent. You made many a mistake, Madame. I remember how we went a-fishing to Tver gubernia, but the rivers were empty of fish. We wrote to you, and you said that the water-sprite had lost all fish in a card game and all fish had left to the Novgorod gubernia. We sent a wire there, and they said: no, - all fish is in Tver gubernia. - Well, I misdivined. I did make a mistake. I didn?t know that all fish had gone to the bottom. But let me remind you how the Emperors all jewel decorations disappeared. His closest milieu was under his suspicion. Even an old and loyal gentleman in waiting was humiliated! Still they didn?t find the jewelry. And it was when they called for me. And I did a most simple thing. I asked to bring a glassful of vodka and a saucer with two lumps of sugar atop it. I asked to take it to the icon chamber. And in the icon chamber they put all this near the icon of St. Nicholas. Because the house spirit is silly, we needed him to get drunk. For it was him who had stolen the jewelry. In the meantime, I singled out just a random thing in the room, something unimportant. In our case, it was a pearl pencil, a present from Prince of Oldenburg. And I asked: Your Majesty, where is that pearl pencil? Yes, Your Majesty, where is it, that pearl pencil? Imagine: very soon the pearl pencil disappeared And the hidden jewelry was revealed in the kitchen, on the Christmas tree decorated for the cook?s son. It was the house spirit who hanged them there. Madame. Still, once you made a very grave mistake. You made a good horoscope, but everything went awry. A bomb exploded and many people died. It was an attempt on His Majesty. As for my mother the grand duchess, her carriage was moving from around the corner and met with the bomb accidentally. My dear mother was wounded and stoically clang to life. Shortly thereafter I received a letter from a lady. She was pleading with me to ask to pardon a lady who was allegedly an indirect accomplice in that tragedy. He had only made a chemical preparation for that bomb. She wrote he was a serious and sincere person. He had made a mistake and his mother was suffering. And that he himself was repenting. He had only made that chemical preparation. But my dear mother was killed by that bomb. Madame, it was you who wrote that letter. You did everything to help that young man. The end he was released. And here is his letter: My dear When released from prison on September 6, I did not get back my suspenders, for they couldn?t find them. You promised to find them by Friday, September 9th. If they are found, I?m asking you to return my suspenders. Also I kindly ask you to return a chemistry book estranged from me. Prisoner so-and-so. Resolution: dear Mr. N! Most probably, your suspenders were returned to someone else. Unfortunately, we have no others to redeem. And the book on chemistry we took to the prison library which is a common procedure in such cases. So, you won?t have your book back. Signature: Head of prison so-and-so. Yes, it was a grave mistake of mine. Why throwing boxes with explosives at the tsars Our Father The Tsar is the only person who is not a thief. And the tsarina is not a thief either. Madame, all I have left from my dear mother is this photo portrait. This is all I have left from her. I was told one secret: photographers are agents of death. Only they don?t even know about this. And people are so eager to have their photos, to have at least something left from their unimportant life. These daguerreotypes are mortal all the same. Photos are born from silver grains. The silver blooms and then becomes ageing because of the air and the sun. It fades, withers away and vanishes. Once this fact aroused amazement. But soon it will vanish, too. And when you are nevermore, Your Excellency, there will be no one to feast their eyes this treasure of love. There will be only the indifferent Nature. So... You should rather throw them away not a waste basket, or, even better, burn them down. To throw into a waste basket The grand duchess Madame, your spiteful Better tell me who killed that man. You should pour a glassful of vodka, and I will ponder. Please ponder. She said to kindle the fireplace so as to ponder, lying on the polar bears skin. Shell ponder, lying on the polar bears ski Shell recline on the polar bears skin, in front of the fire, pondering about one more murder. She will ponder. Madame said. I sorry... Madame wants to get into the chandelier and said to bring the ladder. Now bring the duke. Now bring the duke. I am going to narrate. The mushrooms on a glade in the woods are doing gymnastic figures. A young peasant woman sits near a coffin nailing it together. A tot pees into a pottie. The mother puts a silver pottie under the spout because he hasn?t peed much enough. He hasn?t peed much enough. Now the pottie is full, and she wraps it into a piece of cloth... Now she runs The children sit in the coffin, sailing away... How frightening it is in the woods... Drink this, grannie... For your good health... Now she came to... Time to go. The old witch walks... The mushrooms... The horse... A dead man. She passed him. No, she is crawling back. She has found him. She is doing her witchery... He is breathing. The man opened his eyes, ready to speak. He narrates his version of the murder. Now I am wandering in nothingness, but every time I recollect what she said, I can feel that scorching in my chest. The princess said Take me wherever you want. Have such awful words ever before reached human ear Take me wherever you want. Have such awful words ever before reached human ear? It seemed to me it was going on in some nightmare. Come with me... Come with me... Then silence fell everywhere. No, not everywhere. Some. It was softening nearby. I undid the Tope and listened closely. And realized it was I myself sobbing. Take me wherever you want. Take me wherever you want... If I can?t stand for myself, then whoever will And if I stand only for myself, then what for am I If not now, then when And I decided to do away of myself. With difficulty I disentangled myself from the tree. A dagger was glistening in front of me... I took it, and at one stroke thrust it into my chest... At night, someone sneaked up to me, pulled out the dagger and put a ruby on my forehead. It still remains a mystery who it was. And I left to the other world forever. Tell me, oh you, the ten-headed one, does paradise exist Paradise We all had our paradise childhood... And we all were immortal in that paradise...
