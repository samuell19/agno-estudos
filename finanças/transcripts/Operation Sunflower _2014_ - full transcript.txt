-Suction. -We're losing him. -Bag him. Everyone out of the way. Shock. CPR. Come on, he's slipping away. Shock. Continue compressions. -What's that? -What is that? It's a red alert. It's not a drill. It's not a drill, huh? Mom! Mom! Mom, open up! Mom! Mom! Hi, Danny. It's a red alert. -I can't get a hold of Michal. I didn't hear it. -The lines are busy. We have to go to the bomb shelter. let's see what's going on. given an Iranian military offensive. of the Home Front Command. removed missiles from the dugouts that carry nuclear warheads. any location in Israel. to arm the missiles, to launch missiles... an atom bomb. to the bomb shelter. -Mom, we have to go now. -Nothing will happen. Where's the water? -Take the compote. What's this? Your uncle's archive. I can't get a hold of Michal. -There's no need to call anyone. -Yeah, except 40 thousand missiles and Hamas but you know nothing will happen and you're on top of things. Your uncle Feierberg told me that when I think it's time, -You're in my way. The time has come. Feierberg 1. Here you go. A man with no first name. calling him Feierberg too. Here you go. Thank you. and this is what you want us to do? Leaf through notebooks? the final moments of your life? No, in my final moments with lots of salami. You're in my way. isn't going to kill me. I'd read this notebook, you're going to do now. -Read. the first three PhD students nuclear physics department. "Ephraim, Moshe and Gila. "The first discussion in the lab and Amiram. in the whole department." This is the first year, in physics research in Israel. what I would say to them. when I was in the corridor. is known as "Experimental Philosophy". That's how I began. the secrets of creation. out of the tree of knowledge. with dilemmas you have never known. to plant or uproot. If you want, you will build. as it gets. is very disappointed in you. with the "Egged" bus company to study nuclear physics. and Feierberg will teach you not quantity. The nucleus is small, but it's where everything starts. Good luck. -Gila. -I grew up in Haifa. What now? Helmut Moll made contact. -Helmut Moll? Can't be. He won't meet with us. You know how much we tried. He wants to see you tomorrow. Does he have conditions? and only the head of Mossad. of German Intelligence and not on his turf? Listen, if this is for real, -Yes. -Obviously. Here's your plane ticket. This is a copy of the biggest arms deal ever in the Middle East. The Russians are selling the finest weapons to Egypt and Syria in large quantities that can destroy Israel. It will take them a few years to incorporate the weapons and then you're doomed. Thank you. But why are you telling me this? Don't thank me, thank Felix. I'm here because of him. Felix? Who's Felix? My best friend at school, he was one of yours. He disappeared in what you call "the Holocaust." Well, I'll be damned... 80 Sukhoi bomber planes... T-34 tanks... Wow, it's all here. Missiles, missile batteries... Syria, Egypt, Iraq. the entire agreement, huh? Down to the last bullet. I'm sure of it. cannot sit still by the late 60s. as many weapons as possible from anywhere we can. will have us do in the coming years: Procure a lot of weapons. What is it this time? The formula. They can't figure it out. Why the hell is it so complicated? They fail with the math calculations. They can't calculate the amount of material they have to compress to create the fission and the chain of reaction to produce critical mass. Every discussion with the minister begins with: "Why doesn't France have the bomb yet?" He doesn't understand how 8% of the defense budget goes to the atomic energy committee and Francois can't build a bomb for France. Tell your minister I'm doing everything I can. It's the formula. We can't afford to get it wrong, we can't figure it out. That's all. France must have the bomb. -273 degrees Celsius. That's inaccurate. The temperature... is the constant. This temperature is -195. Yes? Yes, hold on. Levi. The Prime Minister. Levi speaking. "Get over here at once!" What's the time? 11:20. on the Soviet arms deal. one step ahead. It's unbelievable! it's bigger than that. -What? a nuclear option for Israel. What did you say? building Manhattan in Dimona. we have what we need, is where to build it. This is serious. Only 3 countries have a bomb: USA, Russia and Great Britain. trying to build a bomb. in France? of the atomic energy committee. And Claude. Claude. I'll meet with him. on our borders in Khan Yunis in spoken Arabic and we will all go and we'll swim in the sea "And we'll eat falafel and drink..." and continue tomorrow. One more verse. and we will all go and we'll swim in the sea and drink Araq, and sip coffee. to the shore peacefully "He'll whistle to a bather "Sir, don't venture too far! business as usual." the Nobel prize for physics. A simple statistic. are Jews. when we win the prize. May I? would be used, to humanity? very hard. Right answer. Aren't we leaving? We're leaving. We're leaving. It takes 3 things to build an atom bomb: A nuclear reactor, uranium and a formula. With all the money at his disposal, Francois completed two components: A reactor and uranium. His scientists can't figure out the formula. So you're saying that Israel has no reactor, no uranium, no formula... And no money. none at all Right, but Ben Gurion won't accept "It's impossible." Tell Ben Gurion that your best friend in France says that France, with its endless resources, hasn't succeeded in getting the formula There's no chance that Israel will achieve a nuclear option. No chance. Are you sure he was honest? as you are with me. What are you going to do? Wait till morning. night of sweet illusions what he's asking for. A considerate Levi. in all our years together. How humane of you. What are you doing?! I met Eitan. in Tokyo yesterday. who practiced their English on him: "How do you do? my name is Yozhi. "Where do you come from? From Israel." They never heard of Israel. "Jerusalem." No reaction. "I'm Jewish!" "Ah, Jewish!" Their eyes opened wide. "Jewish! Einstein!" Einstein. E=mc2 E=mc2... E=mc2... you brought me, Shoshana. E=mc2. mc2=Einstein. Einstein=Jew, and the land of Israel. Very nice. will invite Fuchs to Israel. -Fuchs. of nuclear science. will invite him here. He's a Jewish scientist, in the Holocaust. will remind him of that. Good job. Good job, Shoshana. That's what I said. Good job, Levi. Fuchs is coming. at Sde Boker on Thursday. -Yes, -So? nuclear physicist? sorry to disturb you. Nuclear physicist. Feierberg. we teach together at the university. Professionaly he is the faculty's star. -But where does he fall short? -He's from Germany? Yes, a Yekke. I want to know everything about him. Alright. -Or should I say morning? -Morning. Dr. Feierberg. -Amiram -Hello, nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Levi is head of Mossad. Shoshana is his deputy. You have a reputation in science. about you. a theoretical question: gives you the formula to develop a nuclear option, can you head a team with that option? Feierberg, this is serious. I told them you're the man. must have a nuclear option. It must. I want you to head the team. you'll get anything you want. No restrictions, you hear me? I'm not your man. I'm sorry, I told you... It was an excellent meeting. I got exactly what I need. But he just said he's not... head a scientific team a nuclear option. He didn't say he can't. He said he's not our man. He said no, unequivocally and I don't know anyone else who can scientifically do it. Amiram, no one says no to Levi. What is it you don't understand? He wants to go down in history as the Prime Minister who gave his people the perfect insurance policy. That what happened with Germany won't happen again. He ends every meeting with: "France must procure the bomb!" I don't know what to do. We can't figure out the formula, I don't have a solution. There's always a solution. What worries me is that when we retire we'll toss those balls but we won't be able to pick them up. There's always a solution. To Abraham "Abe" Fuchs, your name is engraved... they'll execute him. -Yes. He has no choice. made him a "cup of tea". transit camps, some Holocaust, some third Temple he would go down in history. To seal the deal, he also told him did for the United States, he must do for his own people. to work with Feierberg. right away, until we have the knowhow. Feierberg didn't say yes yet. -You're not listening to me. until Feierberg has the exact formula. -He will. You underestimate him. With his past, there's no way he won't agree. to change history, okay? He won't be able to refuse. Your brother was a true hero. What would you do for us, if we had the formula? If you had the formula? You heard me. Then we have a deal. You give us the formula and we'll build your reactor, we'll provide the uranium, the heavy water, anything you need. Can you ensure such a deal? We'll go to Maurice. If Maurice is convinced, the Prime Minister will agree. He's Prime Minister thanks to Maurice. Claude? Claude? In memory of Pierre, we'll call it "Operation Sunflower". Excuse me for interrupting. Why isn't Feierberg here yet? -l was in Paris, I spoke to Claude, I came back from France, and you still didn't get Feierberg. gives us the formula, the French are signing the deal and you're fiddling with papers. instead of bringing Feierberg in by the ears! to meet Fuchs. -I told him Feierberg is sick. -Forget about the photo! Sick... He's sick in the head! historic opportunity, to fruition with his skills and he's deliberating! to think about it, right? His conscience is bothering him. extermination camp‚Äù, with all that babble. the professor of nuclear physics, would cut the crap! with all that moral bullshit... How long?! I want Feierberg here now! And I mean now! What? The photo. and this is Felix. Who's Felix? in Germany. You tell Helmut Moll that Felix, Pinhas Feierberg, for getting us the papers, didn't die in the Holocaust. and you'll invite him. but Levi, he'll do our work for us. Why are you shouting...? I thought they murdered you like all the Jews at our school. I was so scared, I was such a coward. But you're alive, Felix. Yes. I am alive, Adolf. After the war there is no more Adolf, no more Von. I am Moll. Helmut Moll. I am still Feierberg. What are you doing here? I kept silent one time too many, and now you are facing existential danger again. And you want to save us? I won't miss an opportunity to do so. The Russians signed an arms deal with Egypt and Syria which your people didn't know about So I met with Levi and told him everything. What's that got to do with me? With the quantity and quality of weapons that Egypt and Syria are getting, if Levi doesn't come up with a brilliant idea, you risk death again. Is that all? I owe you something else. Here. I should've returned it to you back then. Believe me, Pinhas, I know about these things. Your lives are really at risk. When you were building the first bomb... We believed we would end all wars forever, that the bomb itself would be the ultimate deterrent. Whatever you decide, you'll be sorry you didn't choose the opposite. If you refuse, Auschwitz will pursue you to the grave. And if you do build the bomb, Hiroshima-Nagasaki will... haunt your worst nightmares. How do you fall asleep? Believe me, all those brave, humanitarian ideals that haunt your sleep, will disappear if Egypt or Syria or Iraq ever do get the bomb. Look at the map. The only friend you have, the only one you can count on not to be afraid of, is the Shah of Iran. Otherwise, all the surrounding countries want to wipe you off the face of the map. Something has changed recently. a nuclear option. a huge arms deal with the Russians. a massive war will break out will be killed. developing nuclear weapons? is the only effective deterrent. -Think about it logically, Gila. You're a scientist, Feierberg. not a strategist. something you don't understand Ben Gurion to examine radioactivity. in all matters weapons if not to use them? an option that... of deaths. -On the contrary. no one will get killed. Who's "we?" Us. to disclose this to you. I need you. -No, Gila, I told him. I need you. Come with me to Paris, come. and Moshe too.I need all of you. in the field of nuclear physics. -l do? but I don't see the resemblance. I do. I've ever seen. I'm ugly, Mom. you bring home is so pretty? It's your compote. and they don't leave me alone. When he played the guitar... never got married? fell at his feet. Was she good looking? Another 60 minutes, Mom. My good looks mean nothing. Stop it. the emergency meeting the President of the United States. because in 60 minutes the arming of the missiles... Lucky I didn't get married. is a crime. Danny, it's okay to be scared. It's not smart not to be scared. you'll give me lots of grandchildren. arrived in Jerusalem. of Moonshine with a transistor radio." -You did? -Yes. in awe of the radio. "How does it work without wires?" do you know how it works?" What I'm about to tell you State secret. with anyone. to develop a nuclear option. -Yes. Feierberg is heading the project we need you. from France on this journey we will provide the State of Israel for its continued existence. $0 we need an answer now. Moshe? Thank you. Ephraim? -Great. Gila? Are you in? with you. -Ephraim, don't be a child. where you stand. and I told him I'm not going. I'm not going. won't do any good. Are you disappointed in me? No. On the contrary. What name did you go by? Felix. Felix Feierberg. Felix. I like it. -Where to? New York. -Yes. in New York? Felix Feierberg. -Yes You're different, Felix. That means we're abnormal. In New York which means, are the ones who are normal and the normal people are abnormal. You hear me? Wanna go? No one survived. Only you. Not on your father's side either. Command decoration, Very nice. Why do they call you Warsaw? Okay. We'll let you know. Thank you. What do you think? I think he'll do fine. He'll attend a course. who will do as he's told. graduated with honors. very impressive. Thank you. knows his students so well. only the ones who excel. PhD students in the department. in your academic career. What do you say? I don't know what to say. Are you interested? Very. after beginning your doctorate you're throwing it all away. is a one time opportunity. With the future I foresee for you, I expected you to be more frank, someone put in your mouth. I'm sorry. of the course. That's okay, I know exactly what's going on. for a convention. this further. Agreed. my daughter when she asks me 200 thousand people instantly in horrible agony. What will I say to her? You're upset with him. Gila, he's your advisor. He's much older than you. I'm sure that makes it hard on him. But he's a Yekke and Yekkes need time. That's just the way it is. But Paris... Paris. Paris will do the rest. Secrecy is crucial here. leave this room. in an enterprise of the State of Israel for generations. This secret must not leak out. will do whatever they can a nuclear option. to do that the scientists themselves. -Hello. Keeping this secret is a matter of life and death. the heaven and the earth. was unformed and void, the face of the deep. "And God said: 'Let there be light.' "And there was light.

"And man trained every animal "And man ploughed the land "And man invented the wheel ships on the seas "And man controlled steam "And man flew like a bird "And man conquered the stars "And man built the atom bomb. was unformed and void, the face of the deep..." Finally you see the light, Pinhas. I'm going alone. No, we're going together. It's the right decision. it looks good on you. you'll do it all. The world will be at your feet. far away from here. I'm going alone. How much time do you need to verify it's the right formula? A few months, to make sure it's applicable? It all depends on their guy. What do you know about him? -Nothing. Pinhas Feierberg. He's not listed anywhere. Levi praises him, says he's a genius the only Israeli able to provide us with the formula and to apply the data that the Israelis want from us. It's hard to believe. People of his calibre don't just pop out. Never read any of his articles, never heard of him. Go figure those Jews... I hope you're right. Let him come, so I can evaluate him before we decide to collaborate. When we sing of the cherry season The nightingale and mockingbird will celebrate together Pretty girls' heads will be turned And the sun will shine in the hearts of lovers When we sing of the cherry season The mockingbird will whistle so well 1 will always love the cherry season Since that time, I guard in my heart An open wound And even Lady Fortune Cannot ease my pain 1 will forever love the cherry season And the memory I guard in my heart. In memory of Pierre. In memory of Pierre. Vive la France! To Pierre. To my brother. On July 16th, 1942, at 4am, someone burst into the club and said that the police are arresting the Jews in order to deport them. We saw the neighborhood cop, our neighbor, taking a father and mother and two children. No one did a thing. Pierre appeared out of nowhere and hit the cop with an iron rod. He grabbed the children and started to run, the parents ran after him. My father didn't wait for the knock at the door. When Hitler came to power, our teacher said all contact with Jews is forbidden. My friend Adolf who sat next to me, asked how we can identify a Jew. The teacher said it's simple. He stood me in front of the class. "This is how you recognize a Jew." I came home without my schoolbag. That night my father smuggled us into Switzerland and from there we flew to England. What are you offering? The formula for a reactor. They have what they claim they have? We worked with him around the clock for the past 10 days. I can say with all certainty that I don't know how, but he has the formula. If he continues working with us, there's a big chance that France will resume its position as the world's fourth superpower. That man has in his mind what we are lacking. Either we close the deal with Levi or France has no bomb. That's what you have to tell Prime Minister, Maurice. Only you can convince him. And the price? Israel will be a member of the club. A deal like this is practically a declaration of war on the US. By the time the Americans find out, there will be no turning back. It will be kept top secret. Can you keep an operation of this size from the foreign minister? When the Americans built the bomb, VP Truman knew nothing about it. Only you, Francois, the PM and I know the secret. And the money? We're dealing with the Jews... Ben Gurion will ask you to be one of the funders. Alright. Come with me. Mother, this is the young Israeli I told you about. Give me your hand. Your line of fate is very deep. Maurice, it's fine. Be at the Hotel Matignon tomorrow at 9am. The Prime Minister will see you. Can Maurice really get us in to the Hotel Matignon? That's the same question that the PM asked Maurice before the last elections and Maurice said "Yes." What would have happened if I had different lines on my hand? If Maurice's mother didn't like the lines on your hand, nothing would have happened There will soon be 4 nuclear superpowers: The USA, Russia, Great Britain and France. Four. Five. neither of us "would be approved.‚Äù what this line means, Mom? bombarded with nuclear warheads. the last 30 minutes of my life on nonsense. your dear brother from Germany, That's probably what killed him. have a wild Oriental imagination. That's not what he died from. killed him. the radioactive radiation. his friends came to say goodbye... about the reunions, Mom? We live in the present. thanks to those people. palm reading stories, -Who the hell is Shimon?! Feierberg always said thanks to Shimon. of opportunities. Shimon laid the foundation. he's referring to Maurice. George was Maurice's alias. Ambiguity. We went to Elgozy's house. in my life. He was single, from a young age. with the greatest French paintings. Chagall, Picasso... when they were unknown. in his bathrooms. I must have my mother's approval.‚Äù He took me into the living room that looked like a throne. I walked up to her, I gave her my hand. "George, it's alright.‚Äù at the Hotel Matignon, of the Prime Minister the Hotel Matignon it was all a bluff. We go up to the second floor and enter the Prime Minister's room. let me handle this," It was like a fairytale. -That's okay. Pasternak. you feed the ducks. what Paris has to offer? Actually, not so much. must be keeping you very busy. "What you're doing here?" Not Professor. Pasternak. physics department doesn't know of nuclear physics are doing? recommended you to begin with? I had no idea. to maintain secrecy. we won't talk about it here. the schedule with you. I'l need an assistant. if I can take you into account. I love academia. in Israel, I'll be available. That's what I wanted to hear. You know what academia is like. Thank you. -Feierberg estimates for the next trial in a few months. He believes it'll work this time. Then I'm all yours. Great, then it's agreed. I'm giving a lecture. But remember, not a word. Thank you. Pasternak called. He must talk to me. I like the diplomatic dress code. We look like queens and you look like waiters. I bet a woman came up with it. I think I can expect a promotion. A promotion? After Paris? Levi will be here soon. to the Prime Minister. Levi's already here. He said to say hello. Levi's here? -At "Chez Simon." to meet the Israelis the private room. a Frenchman and two Israelis. were Israelis? -By their shoes. I walked in. Almost like you. I wasn't surprised. at the embassy tomorrow. happens in France without me. How's my bowtie? is so elegant. of the American ambassador think that she's French. Levi loves his foie gras. Cheese, wine and foie gras. on scientific relations. for foie gras. That's what an atom bomb looks like? A French atom bomb. May 1? -Be my guest. Is this the type of Hiroshima? No. This is the type that weighs 12 kilos, the equivalent of 40,000 tons of TNT. It's much bigger. 200,000 people will die instantly and thousands more will die from long term effect of radiation. That's what it can do. Do you ever have second thoughts? Not even a first thought. If I had bombs like this in '38 I would have dropped them one by one until Germany would have surrendered. Is it because you're a Jew that you're asking this question? It's in your genes. If it's a matter of genes, then Levi is surely not Jewish. the PhD students with you. I'm sorry, I can't help you. The plan for scientific cooperation that he's trying to procure for Israel. that nonsense? goes down without my knowledge? listen to me. to perform a nuclear test. no idea what's going on. one another for many years, that I am Yeruham Sharon, the Israeli ambassador to France. Nothing, and I mean nothing without my authorization. Levi is destroying the country. a nuclear reactor. Talk to Ben Gurion, control Levi. it's that bad. It sounds terrible. to my attention. we're in a hurry Foreign Minister's reception. I'l call the foreign minister and the Prime Minister. the project. What? He's off his rocker. What if he's right? Suzanne, what's with you? Wouldn't I know about it? What do you think? were discussing in the restaurant. when he saw me. I have to call the embassy. to wire the foreign minister to the Prime Minister. and you're not doing a thing! go over my head! made a fool of himself in '56 to assure the UN that Israel would not attack Egypt. occupying the entire Sinai. can tell Ben Gurion himself. All this affair will result in, in Bolivia. I like Paris better. -Pasternak was never here. Let's go. Hello? warn Feierberg. They mustn't talk. I'monit. I know you're in there. Open up, Pinhas. Open up. Felix, getting here wasn't easy. What are you doing here? How did you find me? I told you this is forbidden. Stop it, it's me, David. I found you. You have to go. It's stronger than me. What's this? Since when do you have a gun? What's going on, Felix? You wouldn't understand. than you and me. He came to his apartment. Feierberg might crack. That's too bad. Take care of it, Shoshana. Get us some baguettes tomatoes and apples. -After you. Hello. -Hello. I'l just get fat. You're supposed to say you'll find me prettier. and a little fatter. This one. You should drink wine with this cheese. Once I give them the formula, there's no turning back. are always so sensible. because of you? and so foolish at the same time. Did you get everything? Yes. Shall we go? but I have a few things to do. See you later. Sir, you have to pay. You men have issues. I don't have issues. Why isn't he coming with us? Is it something I did? and you still don't get it? What, that he doesn't love me? It's more than that. He'll never sleep with you. Feierberg isn't into women. Come. word of love. Let's go. Thank you. Excuse me, please, where is the toilet? You go in and then you go downstairs. Thank you very much. you didn't agree right away. You thought it over. Why did you say yes in the end? that instantly agrees. mindless soldiers. I'm just the opposite. to Dean of the science department in 15 years. You wanted honesty? who always gets what he wants. This is an historical moment, world order is resuming its rightful place. France is resuming its role as a world power alongside America, Russia and Great Britain. There are now 4 nuclear superpowers and they will determine the global agenda. Gentlemen... Vive la France! Soon there will be another small power with a nuclear option. France will keep up its part. This test, without your skill, Feierberg... What? This is Jean Paul, the operation's chief of security. A man in his 30s just collapsed at a cafe near St. Germain. He's dead. David Mayer. Do you know this man? No, I never saw him. We found your address in his pocket. I have no idea who he is. What happened? We found a dead guy at a cafe with Feierberg's address in his pocket. We have to find out who the man is and why Feierberg's address was in his pocket. If the Americans are on to us, it's over. that Feierberg is...? I hope you have a good reason. It's about Feierberg. before I go to the Prime Minister. Who's Feierberg? Good question. and Ephraim understand of a nuclear option? in Paris. As head of the physics department How dare you? -Let's say what you're saying is true, the head of Mossad, such an important decision -Then Ben Gurion is a megalomaniac. is a threat to the country. -Or? in the New York Times will be: a nuclear option." a much greater price. for the Prime Minister -What do you mean? I mean you're right. when he appointed Feierberg. You should head this project. as head of the department right away It's the Prime Minister's decision. I will head this sacred assignment. as soon as possible. at the disposal of this project. with a nuclear option. Wonderful. Amiram? Then Ben Gurion is a megalomaniac. is a threat to the country. -Or? in the New York Times will be: a nuclear option." us pay a much greater price. he mentioned Ephraim too. I told them to keep this a secret! we're finished. We can't take any risks. I'm listening. in another 8 or 9 weeks. -Our preparations are nearly done. arrive, they can begin. The Americans are suspicious. that what they suspect is true, they won't let us see this through. The project will collapse! Amiram, what's wrong? Anderson asked to meet me in Rome. -Just before I came in. What did he say? -And what did you say? What could I say? on atomic energy. We have to play for time. especially in France. The secret must not get out. You'll be sick. What about Moshe? Send Moshe to take care of it. No one will suspect. to see me yesterday. of a handsome boy. in his pocket. in Israel, I didn't know he was here. I said I don't. -No. Better not to know I think it was Levi. Levi? Why would Levi kill him? to keep the secret from getting out. -Go feed the ducks. to feed the ducks? I don't know about? No. It's Pasternak. and didn't tell me? He asked me not to tell anyone. when we're done in Dimona. about Dimona? about Dimona? -What?! to keep this a secret. So after David I'm next? It's not funny. back to your apartment alone. of the other guys until we go home. sounds good to me. not Levi either. close to you. right now! I mean it. I mean it too. I've been waiting for you to say: and move in with me." Very funny. Come on. This drawing is risky. have a sunflower. for a drawing like this. Still, I'm proud to belong. to make this the symbol of Dimona. We don't have time. The French security officer called. Ephraim has disappeared. Two more configurations. the process? without him? No, we need him. without him. He'll do it. He has to. To Levi? because of people like him. -The phone didn't ring. It did, you didn't hear it. The Prime Minister is on the line. if we can inform the world one must be mindful of. that Israel has a nuclear option, and a war will be averted. by the Prime Minister. didn't promise to keep his promise. keep his promise? want to go to war. Open your eyes. and Ephraim. but he's alive. when we're done. Let's get on with it. Wake up, Feierberg. against yourself. with jokers up his sleeve. They killed Ephraim. He killed Ephraim! She's ruining everything. -Don't move! Don't move, she's right. Feierberg knows she's right too. Feierberg is playing chess but the poker players will win. and his Yekke decency will finally complete the process. that are working for me, you understand, not him. You succeeded against all odds. Congratulations. The Israeli people will thank you until the end of time. Now it's your turn. Call the Prime Minister. I can help you. a weapon they don't want to deal with. Simple and right. It will be right not to tell our enemies with a nuclear option, a war that we can win, to have lied to you with a nuclear option. for the State of Israel it's an existential opportunity. from secure bunkers are in the bomb shelters, ventured out into the open spaces. outside the secure space. on which the Americans intended at the end of WWII. they didn't go through with it the historic capital of Japan. due to its historic significance? could be.
