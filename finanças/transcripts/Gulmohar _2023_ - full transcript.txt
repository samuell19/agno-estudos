Yes, I'll tell them today. Everyone's here. Perfect time. Okay, bye. Adi, stop. Brother! -Your photos always turn out bad. -That's right, Amu. -Got any good photos, Amu? -No. Your husband always ruins my photos. Careful, sweetie. -Oh! "Sweetie"? -Shut up, brother. No, he's standing here. It seems I woke you up at the wrong time. No. We're having a party. How was your presentation? Good, Grandma. My boss will review it now. -Amu, Amu! -Yes, Grandma? A brandy for me. Small, okay? See this, Grandma. -Your work is done. -Thank you, Arun. -Okay, bow to me! -Sure. -Ma, have you seen my drink? -No, I haven't. Come, take a photo with your aunt. You okay? Yes, I'm fine. My mother has sold our house. My son refuses to live with us. It's fine. He's working hard. -Give him some time. -Time? Have we needed time to correct ourselves? How are you, Uncle? Is the packing done? -Adi, how's your app progressing? -It's okay. Is it on track? It's nothing but the arrogance of youth! I'm always caught in these father-son quarrels. Who knows what Adi wants. He never says anything. Where were you, Kusum? Not for me. -Kishore, a drink? -No, man! Don't be worried. Friction is normal between father and son. It's healthy. Kamal, there was no friction between my father and me. -Cheers! -Cheers! Have you written your song? -No. -Why? So much time for a song? -Grandma, your brandy. -Is this a small? It's small. Arun bhai, those were different times. Mama, go easy. Kusum and everyone, come here. -What, Uncle? -Stop that western music. I'll tell Reshma. A song for you. You'll be swimming in my melody. -And people who can't swim? -They'll drown. We don't want to drown! Your son-in-law will accompany me. Come on, my boy. Sameer! Very good. -Uncle, did Amu write this song? -As if. She only writes songs for her sweetheart Ankur. -Write a song for me someday. -Don't tease her. They are lovers like Laila-Majnu. Uncle, let her be. Avinash, please. Kusum, this is for you and all you foolish Batras. And to this final night in your beloved home, Gulmohar. C-sharp. I'll be back.

Bye, Adi. -Bye. -Be safe. Uncle, next time you must sing in their new house. Bring your father next time. We'll mix martini in his lime juice. -Great idea! -He'll start singing too. ♪ Punishment for all ♪ He'll faint! He's not the fainting type. He'll make us faint. Come on, don't remind me of that grumpy old man. I can't believe this is our last night here. Mama? 34 years. 1988, January. How time flies! Well... It's your last night here. A drink is a must. You have Indu's permission. -Permission? -Indira Ma has stirred! -The Goddess Indira. -Ten hands. Don't forget I'm the one living with her. You'll get me into hot water. -You're loving this. -Okay. Now, everyone, be quiet! Silence! Reshma, wait two minutes. I have something to tell you all. Just listen to me and don't interrupt me. What is it, Mama? The thing is... it's Holi in four days. I want us to celebrate Holi together in this house. But tomorrow-- Yes, Indu, I know. The packers are coming. We have to leave the house. I want to celebrate Holi here, Indu. Kusum, what a fantastic plan! Uncle, please. Mama, what are you saying? Arun, Holi is our favourite festival. Daddy regarded it as the start of the new year. So, why can't we stay on? Please. Why not? Mummy, our suitcases are packed. The packers will arrive at 9 a.m. How can we stay in all the dust and chaos? We can always come here on the day of Holi. Celebrate here, then go. But we planned to stay in a hotel for a week, then move to the new flat. This last-minute change of plan... Hotel cancellations... I'll pay for all that, Indu. Just say yes, please. Mummy, please understand. It'll be uncomfortable for everyone. Only four more days, Indu. We'll manage. Mama, why are you being stubborn? There'll be packers everywhere, and a big mess. Everything will be topsy-turvy. -There'll be no space for us. -Space? There were 14 of us living in a one-bedroom flat in Jamshedpur. Remember? Please, Arun. Let's stay together for these four days. -Then we'll all be separating-- -No one's separating, Mama. Except your grandson. He refuses to live with us. He prefers to rent a house. "I want to fund my own life!" Sitting out of a co-working desk. -Have you thought about Divya? -Papa, it's not like that. Divya, please don't defend his stupidity. Papa, Adi and Divya have decided to live on their own, so why are you objecting? Why did Daddy build Gulmohar Villa? Why? So that we could all live together. Right? That's the meaning of a home. Right? You and Sameer are living with your in-laws, aren't you? -Must you always compare? -Don't argue. -You're young, so hush. -Please. I am not that young. -That's it! -I'm not a kid anymore. Mama, go to bed. Reshma, tidy up the room. One more thing. What? I have bought a small house in Pondicherry. I'm going to live there from now on. Okay, good night. Good night, everybody! Kusum? Pondicherry? Puducherry, Papa. Payal. What's happening in this house? -Did you know about this? -Me? How could I know? How could you not? You two are her only friends. Yes. But we're not astrologers to predict her future plans. -When did you start? -Over a month ago, Kusum-ji. I have done well. I'm feeling very relaxed. Seriously! Jeetu, let's go. I think you should start too. Reshma, where's the tea? -Good morning. -Good morning. -Nandi, Reshma. -Thanks is "nandri." -They're just the final changes. -I know, Adi. But-- -It's urgent, Koshi. -Yes, I understand, but I can't ask my team to work for free again. Your ideas are great, but I can't be out of pocket. You still owe us money. I'll get the investment soon. Tell me when it comes. Promise, I'll get the coding done then. Saw the match last night? -You knew about her Pondicherry plans? -No. I swear. -Get me the pickle jars. -Morning, Mama. Morning, child. -Good morning, Papa. -Morning, dear. It's terrible, Madan-ji. Even aristocrats are selling their homes. Skyscrapers are changing the look of Delhi. Turn here. Hey! Hey, He-Man. Where's Gulmohar Villa? -This is it. -Arun Batra? Where's the entrance? Don't behave like a clown, just tell me. Let's go. Carry on with your push-ups. What a rude fellow! I told you to park carefully. Has the old man arrived? Sometimes you drive the father, sometimes the son. You're blessed with a great job. Chhote Dada-ji, water. Surekha isn't here yet, so who'll make his tea? Want some tea? Tell Indu to make him some tea. And your special lime juice for me. -What's this new drama? -What drama? Your new home in Pondicherry. I bought it with my own money. I want to live there. The children are grown up. They've got their own lives. Now I want to live my life. You've been too lenient towards your family. They'll get even worse if you go. Sudhakar, I'm 76. I have only a few more years left. I don't want any more responsibilities! I want some peace. Peace? As if your life was full of struggle. You have always been selfish. You left Jamshedpur for Delhi. Separated me from my elder brother. Reshma, where's the lime juice? Your knot is fine, Arun. Fine is not fine enough. -Phone directory? -It must be perfect. You're even packing this scrap? Mr. 1968... you've got a cell phone now. Indu, some things should stay the same. Must everything change? Change me then. One crazier than the other in this family of yours! -Calm down. -Quiet! Tell your mummy. She springs a big decision on us so casually. But you'll never question her. What can I do? Nobody ever asks my opinion. -Not Mummy or your dear son. -Don't drag Adi into this. Okay. I'll drag myself into this. Who is it? Chhote Dada-ji is here. So? Mummy asked you to make him tea. Tea, tea, tea. These Batras and their tea! Tea, tea, tea. We Batras and our tea! Cheers to tea! If my elder brother were alive, would he allow this? If he were alive, we wouldn't be selling Gulmohar. -But I had to. -Am I to blame for that? Did I say you were? The builder is buying all the neighbouring houses. Despite the economic dip, he's paying good money. What's the point of fighting him? He's a gangster. And a friend of yours. You benefit too. -My friend? -Yes. Mummy, the packers are here. Do you know what you want from the storeroom? Reshma! Reshma! Did you put those two trunks in my room? Surekha hasn't come yet. Such lame excuses! Ask Jeetu to help you. Didn't you tell Jeetu to help with the packing? Jeetendra! -Morning, Mama. -Good morning, son. Greetings, Uncle. -Has the drama started? -Him and no drama? Not possible. There are many in this family to pick on, -but Dad only picks on me. -Patriarchy, sonny! I can't wait to leave. We all go our own way and live life as we choose. Take both trunks to Grandma's room. List the packers' names. Reshma, when you pack the prayer room, put everything on my bed. You're getting her to pack the prayer room? Religion, caste... they all exist for a reason. Okay, Sudhakar. Indu or I will pack it. Stop fussing about everything. It's not good for your health. Is gulping down brandy at your age good for your health? So, that's the real problem. You weren't invited to the party. No. That's your private affair. I have never interfered. A daughter-in-law of the Batras drinking with her grandchildren! But when did you ever listen to anyone? You do as you please. Okay, Mummy. I'll be off. Bye, Uncle. By the way, does he know about the house? You must tell him. Your tea is getting cold. Drink it. My God! Is this full of rocks? You've become so weak. I'm not weak. You are. Ask Reshma to help. Why did you call me, Jeetu? Drop it. Let's go. I'll go. But you should use your brains. Tell you what. While you're packing, hand her a flower and ask her lovingly, "Dear Reshma, may I help you?" -With full confidence-- -Grandma has... Shall we? No, no, we can carry it. How? Reshma, help him. Mr. Sudhakar may be leaving. I must go. What are you staring at? You two, go upstairs! Reshma Saeed? Reshu? -Irfan! -You work here? -Yes, I am the cook. -Masha Allah! -And you? -I'm the packing company supervisor. You're a big shot now. I told her in school that she should marry me. -Irfan and I were in school together. -Not just together, but "together!" Go away! -♪ When I saw you ♪ -You are still the same. -♪ I started dreaming-- ♪ -Hello! I'll get the other trunk. Listen, sign this. Your friend outside has checked the inventory. Here's the list. Just sign. -I'll sign it. -The watchman must sign, Reshu. Odd fellow. Are you married? -That was a disaster. -Why? -I'm divorcing at 4 p.m. today. -Oh, sorry. Don't be sorry. I'm happy. I want out. -Are you married? -No. I'm happy. You were waiting for my divorce? ♪ Hope fills my heart once again ♪ You still blush, Reshu. Uncle was quizzing Mummy this morning. I ran, but Indu got trapped. Neena said you tolerate him because he's your uncle. We know how difficult my father is. Come on, we're family. -Rs. 10 for the kachori. -I don't have change. I'll add it to your account. Listen, Kamal. We have to cancel the hotel booking. Will you talk to Suri? Don't worry. It'll be done. Your mother hit a real sixer! Pondicherry? Out of the blue? Who knows! Sometimes I think, though we live in the same house, we don't know each other. Your father owns a big business and a huge house. So why rent? Just do your job, please. Okay. I'll do my job. -Shall I show you another flat? -No. You don't like what you can rent in your budget. What you like, your wife doesn't. What she likes, you can't afford. This was the only flat possible. Listen to me. I'll persuade them to reduce the rent by Rs. 500. What will 500 do, Rani-ji? Okay, I'll get them to throw in a cooler. Use it in the tiny bedroom. You'll have kids. It can be their room, like a nursery. I'll let you know. Tell me soon. We have the registration, verification and other paperwork. I said I'll let you know. Okay? Okay. Okay? Okay. -Thank you. -God bless. God bless the jobless. Adi, I'll call you back. I'm in an important meeting. Okay, bye. We've seen a growth of 5,000 to 10,000, to 15... Well done, Akanksha. Professionals are doing great. We've seen a great turnover. Well done, Gaurav! We're now ready to scale up. We're moving to a bigger office. So, no more working in these cramped boxes. ♪ Days and nights ♪ ♪ Without you ♪ ♪ Have passed me by... ♪ -Lower it, lower it! -Switch off the lights here! -Wires are spread all over here. -♪ Those lively times-- ♪ Why don't you guys sing? These lyrics are dumb and not on the metre. I need the final lyrics. Use simple words that people get. Send them back to school. "Simple words"? Amu, just do your thing. You don't need to force Urdu into every line. Wow! If you don't get it, you assume it's Urdu. Go. There's no time left. Amu! Amu! Amu... Amu. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have spoken like that. Okay, forget it. Move into your Gurgaon flat quickly. My place is just 10 minutes away. -We can hang out, jam every day-- -Ankur. Amu, what's wrong? You're ignoring me. You wanted space, you got it. You wanted time. Then-- Hey, you love birds, calm down. We're performing in 3 days. Just tell me if you've met someone else. Say something. Ankur, I'll call you later. Please. Deepika, make her see sense. Amu. Ankur, you guys keep arguing. Hold it from the other side. Hold it carefully. Don't make noise! -Keep it. -No. When an elder gives you something, say thank you and accept it. -There's no need-- -Keep it. Bless you. I'm glad Reshma will stay with you. Who knows what the builders will decide once we go. I hope they'll look after Param and Jeetu. You're the one leaving town, Mummy. See you later. Move all this out of the way. How can he become impure if he touches the glass? Chhote Dada-ji has always refused to have anything Reshma serves. Stop buttering me up, Surekha. Why were you late? Yesterday was exhausting. Sure, you're the only one who works. Everyone else lazes around. Correct. In the new house, I'll only cook. You will do the washing and cleaning. I'm warning you. I promise. Their new flat is close to my house. I'm sure sir bought the new place for your convenience. The food is free, so eat! -I'm bearing him because of you. -What? You're "wearing" me? It's English that's bearing you. You flunked 10 times, didn't you? Eat. Food will stir your brains. -Thank you. I flunked 5 times, not 10. -Good for you! One must fail to succeed. Wait and watch! "Wait and watch!" Showing off his English again. Is the builder demolishing the whole house? Seven new buildings will take its place. Each building will have 14 floors and a garden. Delhi is changing forever. I'm so glad we're celebrating Holi together. Remember last Holi when Jeetu was wailing? How could I forget? He got drunk and lost the photo with those male stars. Couldn't you have posed with Madhuri Dixit or Aishwarya Rai? Why go to Mumbai and click a photo with Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor? -Clear the table. -Why did you hit me? You deserve it. Remember? How could he? A drunk Jeetu's real cost was his dear photo lost! -What? -Clear up. If only Arun sir had bought a big bungalow, we'd all be together. -Nice thought! -I know. Do your work. -Reshu... -Irfan, are you leaving? Have you eaten? I'll eat later. Give me your phone number. 98... "Reshu"? I'll call you after my court case is done. Brother, why is she "Reshu" to him? Paint the ceiling properly. You've got two hours before our things arrive. I'm sick and tired of these boxes. -Is Papa still angry? -I'm angry. He's upset. Put the books on a towel. Or else they'll get dusty. -Why are you angry? -You heard your grandma's decision. Oh, sorry. Decisions, plural. Ma, relax. Let her do as she pleases. Just enjoy your fancy penthouse. She wants to settle down in Pondicherry. All alone at 76. How will she manage by herself? Even at this age, she wants adventure. And your papa, "the ideal son," never questions her. I'm really worried about his anxiety. Ma, don't you get anxious. You're always thinking about others. Think about yourself. Be quiet. Just go to your Romeo. They're all so stubborn. Put this box over there. Open that one first, please. Wow, Dad. It's beautiful. What a terrace. It's Gurgaon, but it's not bad, eh? Gurugram, Papa. Gurugram. -It's the new party hang-out. -Careful! It's beautiful. And huge. What a stunning view. Adi is crazy not wanting to live here. -Hush. -What? It's such a big flat. We could move in too. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. The meeting just went on and on. Divya, I've been waiting all afternoon. I know. I didn't even get time to eat. What did the agent say? She wants Rs. 5,000 more. Okay, cool. Signed the lease? Rs. 5,000 a month extra. Rs. 60,000 per year. Okay, Adi, 5 x 12 = 60. I know. Divya, do you have any idea what 60,000 means? Plus registration, bribes-- I know there are other expenses. But we like the flat. Our situation is not that bad. You have a secret money tree? -Yes, I do. -Okay. Relax. Let's sign, please. Don't worry. Are we being silly... wanting to live on our own? -It's what you wanted, Adi. -Yes, but how will we manage? We will. How do other couples manage? But the man in the couple earns something. You want to start that "I am a man" bullshit? Why are you getting cross? I'm just... I'm just saying-- Saying what, Adi? Okay, so you're not earning now, but you will someday. -Start-ups take time. -It's been two years, Divya. So? Keep going. -Till when? -Only you can answer that, Adi. You married a guy whose future is so uncertain. -Are you dying? -Come on! Snap out of it, Adi. We rarely get any time together and you... Call your investor, follow up with him, meet him, use his money, develop your app. Simple. Divya, if life was so simple... Okay. You complicate everything. -What are you doing? -Okay, Adi. I'm off. -Divya. -Please. Divya! Less ghee for me. Kishore. No reading while eating. Grandpa, you have to read this book. It's well-written. It has logic and clarity. It really makes you think. Read sensible books. You should be mature enough to understand other points of view. Blindly following one ideology and concluding something is foolish. So, my thinking is foolish? What else is it? Keep supporting oddballs and you'll get brainwashed. Dad, this is what the majority think today. Ha! The majority. Your views and your thinking sound extreme. Or maybe he just has clarity? What clarity, Papa-ji? The people he works for fund criminals and murderers. What clarity can they give him? He'll become one of them. -Is that your plan? -Absolutely. Today, the job. Tomorrow, crime. The day after, murder. Well done! Why can't you work with honest people? -Mom, nobody is honest. -Work for yourself then. Look at your cousin Adi. He studied computer science too. -He is an entrepreneur. -That old love story again. I make good money, but you praise the guy who doesn't. At least I don't live off my parents and wife. Shut up! Drop it, Kishore. Talk of home truths and we're always in the wrong. What are you saying? Was he not speaking the truth? Adi has a start-up. He's trying. Arun could've easily funded his app, but Adi is trying to find investors himself. Maybe one day he'll be on the Forbes List. Adi is struggling despite his MBA degree. What struggling? Adi and his father are living off my brother's money. But Arun expanded your brother's business overseas. He should be indebted, Kamal. If my brother hadn't adopted Arun, he'd be living on the streets. Any yoghurt, Neena? Yes. I don't know what's wrong with Reshma. She isn't focusing on her work. When I stepped out after lunch, that supervisor disappeared. -Reshma? -Not Reshma. Irfan. No packing's done. Who can ever persuade your mummy? When she comes tomorrow, she'll say, "Indu, my child, let's prepare for Holi. "Make sure this Holi is very special." Don't laugh. Sit back and watch the circus. So what should I do? Slap them? You haven't killed a cockroach in your life. Slapping them is asking for too much. Take those specs off. You look old. I am getting old. So why work so hard? We have all we need. The belly must be fed, Mrs. Batra. At least don't feed it kachoris on the sly. -You fake! -Press there. You're just like your father. Always work, work, work. Don't I look a little like Daddy now? Indu, yes or no? What is it? Nothing. Tell me. Yes or no? Yes. Always. What's wrong? Will we always care for one another? -Stop overthinking, Arun. -No, I'm serious. This house kept us all together. Now the family will scatter. Sometimes I feel I've lost grip on everything. No matter how hard you try to hold sand in your hands, it slips through your fingers. What a deep thought! We didn't have an option. Maybe Daddy would not have agreed. We tried our best too. After all, it's Mummy's house. It was her decision to sell. You mother-in-law and daughter-in-law join hands if I complain about one to the other. Typical Stephenian. "Oh, across the road!" Yes! Stop thinking and stop eating kachoris. Shall I get you some tomorrow? Kachoris? With some tea. Tea, kachori, Batra. Together in school. The divorce night. -A kick up our ass. -Shut up! You're talking nonsense. You should do the talking. Why are you so scared to speak to Reshma? Love isn't about thinking, brother. Or else you'll stay a watchman forever, crying out, "Stay alert!" You don't get it, Param. Reshma has passed the 10th standard. She's educated. I never went to school. I can't even sign my own name. The supervisor who was here met her after years. The bastard was talking to her so intimately. -Were they talking in English? -They even sang together. They also follow the same religion. Our traditions are different. Brother... When you fell in love, did you ask Reshma, "What's your religion?" No? Why? Because love is blind. You can't keep questioning your confidence. Balls to confidence! You don't need an education to say, "I love you." A Shah Rukh Khan film is enough. -Why can't she guess how I feel? -How can she? Can't she see the love in my eyes? I have known you for years. Do I understand you? Why test her by showing her a silent movie? You have three days left. Soon she'll move on, holding another man's hand. Then keep singing that Mashaal song. Don't forget me I'll be missing you I'm off. I'm making a video call home. I'm going. Enough of my wisdom. Jai Hind. Jai Bharat. Foolish lovers. My planets aren't aligned. -Let it be. -Close the door at least. You won't find kebabs as tasty anywhere. Remember how you loved kebabs in school? Irfan, are you okay? Is there something wrong with my hair? Hush! Everyone is asleep. Oh, Narain-ji. -Namaskar! -Namaste. You finished your walk very quickly today. Yes. I'm tired. How does your son Arun run for hours? Namaste. Good morning! Good morning, Mama. You're all alone? Where's Jeetendra? I couldn't find him, so I left. We must get into the habit of going for a walk alone. Mama, sorry, I didn't mean that. -Know Daddy's worst habit? -What? He kept taunting people. He would argue and argue about everything. Goodness! Don't laugh. I see that irritating Batra trait creeping into you. Like father, like son. Thank goodness your son isn't like that. See you. Koshi, I'm waiting for the investor. -I know, Adi. -How many times must I tell you? The money will come any day. Cool down. Why are you getting angry at me? I did it as a favour to you. I have bills and salaries to pay. Your app is solid. It's a great idea. But I can't ask the team to keep working for free. -Coding is not easy. Please understand. -Hi, morning. Okay. I'll try again. -I'm also on a call. -But the chances are very slim. Yeah, it was great! I mean the market is at 3% and the brand is at 5% CAGR. Of course, they will be happy. We're working 10 hours a day. Must we work 14 hours? Turn our homes into offices? Amu. Amu! Hurry up and pack. They're clearing your room today. Are you going with Grandma? There's no end to her shopping or her clothes. Amu, where are you? I'll see you at the shelter home. Call me. It's so messy. Divya, can we talk? I thought we had a rule. If we argued, we'd make up before we slept. Well, too bad. We fell asleep. Why are you behaving like this? How I am behaving? What about you? You've become so negative. What choice do I have? The app's going nowhere. The investor is avoiding me. Living away from the family, the high rent, that agent Rani... It's all risky. Sure, I'm nervous-- So? Must you say whatever crosses your mind? You're talking nonsense! Adi, just drop it. I have meetings till late today. I'm leaving. -Yeah, of course. -What? What "of course," Adi? What's with that tone? Nothing. Go. Seriously, Adi? If this is how we treat each other, why should we live on our own? God spare me! Today's songs all sound the same. When does one song end and the other start... No one knows, no one cares. -Thanks, Grandma. Very helpful. -I'm very helpful. Do come to our housewarming party. We're moving to your area. She's here. -It's Ankur. Your phone's off. -Ma, why did you tell him I'm here? -Keep me out of your quarrels. -I want out too. -Good morning! -Yeah, very good, Papa. Good morning. -What's wrong with her? -Does she ever tell me? Reshma, bring the omelette. The drawing room must be packed away. How can we do it in two days? It'll be fine, Indu dear. Don't worry. Indu, we must start the Holi preparations. This Holi has to be very special. Reshma, the omelette. Yes, Mummy-ji. -The poha is really good, Mama. -Yeah? The ideal son! Mummy-ji! "This Holi must be very special." Reshma, add extra chilli to sir's omelette. Come on, madam. Ankur, why did you call my home? There must be a reason I didn't answer you. Ankur, enough. I don't want to argue with you. Where are you, driver? You're going around in circles. The villa's name is Gulmohar. Don't cancel. Hello! What's wrong? I'm waiting for a cab. -I'll drop you. -No, it's okay. If you're that rich, pay me. Come on. Seat belt. Rani-ji, I'm on my way. I'll give you the cheque. You can confirm the flat. Okay. -I have to pay the estate agent today. -How's work? Good. Have you met the investor? Not yet. But we're close. "We"? Have you got a partner? No, I mean it's progressing. It looks hopeful. Sameer was going to call you. -Did he? -No. -No? Meaning? -He didn't call. You could've called him. At the party, he was talking about his rich uncle. Try him. He's not the right type. -Why? -He trades in coal. So what? He has money. He could buy your app. And he lives in Hyderabad, the technology hub. I don't want just anyone's money. I need someone who's passionate about the app. -And who is this passionate buyer? -Dad, there's no buyer. I'm not selling my app. I'm trying to find an investor. Things are moving. I have meetings lined up. Do you dress like that to your meetings? -Meaning? -Do you dress formally, or do you carry your college bag and wear sports shoes? So, you have a problem with my clothes now? -I'm just asking. -Not asking, you're telling me. Hello, hello, hello. Excuse me. Relax, young man. Relax, okay? You don't need to snap at me. Be patient. You shouldn't snap so much at your parents or Divya. I never dared to talk to my father in this tone. Young man, now that you've decided to live on your own, learn to deal with reality. Look at Sameer or, for that matter, Kishore. They have a grasp on reality. Your Grandpa used to say that you have to be in touch with-- Dad, I know you were the ideal son. And I'm not. Okay, I know. -Can you pull up here? -Why? I'm getting down. Please stop the car. Isn't your office in Jangpura? Thank you for the lift. King Hiranyakashyap was enraged. "Prahlad, I am the God of this world!" But, for Prahlad, there was no other god than Lord Vishnu. So, Hiranyakashyap called his young sister whose name was... -Holika! -Yes! Holika's magical shawl could not catch fire. So, wrapped in her shawl, she sat in the fire with Prahlad. Suddenly, a fierce gust of wind blew and the magical shawl flew off Holika and landed on Prahlad, saving him. Holika and Hiranyakashyap's evil plans turned to ash. So, dear children, remember truth will always win. -What? -Truth will always win. Amu. Amrita! -Amu! -What are you doing? What are you doing? You can't avoid everyone by switching off your phone. I don't want to talk now. Go away! See you later. How long will you keep avoiding us? -What do you want to do? -No idea, okay? I don't know how to resolve this problem. -"Problem"? -Oh, God! You see this as a problem? Unbelievable! You talk of love. Bullshit! Deepika, please. I love you. I love you too. I really don't understand our kids. Arun? -I can't hear you. -I'm at the workshop. Amu has been fighting with poor Ankur all day. See that painting packed in bubble wrap? Cover it. Everything's a mess. Bring it down carefully. Reshma! Easy, be careful. Reshma! -Madam is furious today. -She should be. You've all gone so slow because Irfan isn't here. Shall I tell him? How many times should I tell you? Clean Amu's room, please. I didn't expect this of Adi. What is this behaviour? Getting off in the middle of the road. We should've been stricter with our kids. Forget it. Youngsters today are like that. We were young too, Arun, but we weren't rascals. We always helped our parents. Hold it carefully, will you? Arun, I'll call you back. Radheyshyam. Jeetu. Help them. To the left! Turn, turn. What are you doing? -Sorry, madam. It slipped. -What the hell do you mean? What are you doing? You call this packing? Where's your supervisor? Call him! Poor Irfan. His problems are never-ending. Where's your supervisor? What's his name? Irfan, right? Where is he? He's vanished since yesterday, madam. Vanished? Phone him. -Phone him now. -It's switched off, madam. Where are the other packers? He hasn't shown up, and his phone is off. Mr. Nair's packers were better, madam. They did a great job in two days, and there were no problems. Their supervisor was always there. Go outside. Send the other packers in. They're making me tense. Careful of the sharp edges, Reshma. Jeetu bhaiyya. Jeetu bhaiyya. What's wrong with you? Mistakes happen. Why blame anyone? What did you tell madam? You like stabbing people in the back? No, Reshma. -It was a mistake. -Those workers messed up. So why point fingers at Irfan? Do you know what he's going through? No, I don't. And I don't want to. What are you saying? Has he gone mad? Is Romeo drunk? -Odd fellow. -What happened? Jeetu was badmouthing Irfan. Now he's sulking. Who knows what he is thinking. So sorry for the inconvenience. Our motto is "Forever yours." We're sending a new supervisor. You'll have no reason to complain. -Okay. -Thank you, sir. Thank you. Aditya, are they all start-ups here? Yeah. -India is shining! -When do we sign the lease? I'll let you know soon. Congratulations! The flat is yours. Tell Divya. I'll message you. God bless! Hi, Aditya. I discussed the matter internally. Sorry, the team can't work on the app till we're paid. Try someone else. I can suggest some other coders. Adi... Kishore? It's Adi. How goes it? I don't know, Grandma. It just happened. -We spent time together-- -Amu, do you love her? Do you love her? So? Why be scared? Back in our time, it was very difficult. -Now you are freer. -What are you saying, Grandma? When they find out about me, who knows what'll happen. Who is "they"? You can't be scared or hesitant in love, Amu. If you love, you love. Nothing else matters. You know, there was a time when what people said really hurt me. Their words haunted me, troubled me for days. I wanted to go to medical college. Become a doctor. I didn't get admission. We didn't have enough money. I consoled myself thinking, it wasn't meant to be. I left Jamshedpur and went to Pune for my BA. Freedom! I have lovely memories of that time. ♪ I spent my life trusting you ♪ -Hello. -Hi. I'm Kusum Roy. I am Supriya Palekar. Charming dimples. The singer? ♪ These long years of waiting ♪ ♪ These long years of waiting ♪ Supriya! ♪ Have passed in my loving you ♪ It was a special time. But so short-lived. ♪ I spent my life trusting you ♪ Kusum. I reasoned with myself. It wasn't meant to be. I left Pune and went home. Life went on. Then I met your grandfather. I fell in love again. I got married. We were very happy. But even today his family believe it wasn't meant to be. I had three miscarriages, one after the other. After the third miscarriage, I lost... I lost the will to live. I was sitting in the waiting room of a clinic when a nurse put a small baby, wrapped in a red cloth, in front of me. It was a beautiful baby. He kept looking at me. It was love at first sight. I asked whose child it was. But no one knew. The watchman had found the infant crying in the parking lot. I took it as a gift from Him. That is how Arun came into our lives. Since that day, I've kept telling myself, it was meant to be. Amu, sometimes you should let life write its own story. I can't get through. Mummy didn't tell me anything. Mr. Sudhakar said Grandma knows where the house papers are. Let me ask Arun. Yes, Indu? Did you talk to Kamal or Uncle about the house papers? -No. -He doesn't know either. Can you talk to Mr. Sudhakar? Am I crazy? Arun, do you know where the house deeds are? No. Ask Mummy. She isn't picking up. Amu's phone is off too. I don't know. I'll look in Mummy-ji's room. There's so much junk here. The fool! Indu ma'am, Mummy-ji took a file out of the trunk. It's on the table. Okay. -Mr. Sudhakar? -He's gone for his walk. What is it? He sent me to pick up a file. Grandma was out. Indu madam didn't know where it was. Okay. Leave the keys. -File? -You know your father. We've been married for a long time, so you know him too. Hello. How was your day? -Guess who I met. -Who? Aditya. He's applying for a job in my company. Seriously? I gave agent Rani the cheque today. The flat is ours. Mama? Still awake? I was looking at our old albums. Sit down. Come. Adi. He's so cute! When was this? -When we moved here, right? -Yes. His sweaters were in the cupboard for five years. I aired them out today. Will you wear Daddy's sweaters? All right. I always believed generations of our family would come and go... but Gulmohar would always remain our home. I'll miss this house, Mama. And I'll miss you. Arun, you're back. Indu, our children look so innocent in these photos. And look at them now! Come, Indu, come. Arun. Mama, I'll see you later, okay? Good night, Mama. Indu, can you give me a massage today? My back has gone for a toss. What's wrong? Did the new supervisor show up? I gave the owner of the packing company an earful. Idiots! You didn't really like that mirror. It'll look strange in our new flat. Adi and Divya could've taken it, but... to each their own. The strap is loose on the watch Daddy gave me. You think I'm losing weight? Indu? Indu? Yes or no? What? Yes or no, Arun? Yes, darling. Always. What happened? Think about it carefully, okay? What happened? In Mummy-ji's room today, I found the house papers. And this too. Your father's Will. He made his Will shortly before he passed away. The Will stipulates... in the event of his death, this house will go to Uncle Sudhakar and his son, Kamal. Why is this junk lying here? Everything is in such a mess. Arun, stop. Nothing is in its place. -Dad? -What? All okay? It's fine. Wait, I'm coming. I don't like things being scattered. -Arun. -What is it? -Arun! -What is it? I'll bury you, bastard! What's going on? Param. Irfan, let go. Mummy-ji, Irfan came to see me. They didn't allow him inside. What are you doing? Stop! -I'll bury you right here. -Param, stop! What are you doing? Param, stop! Arun! Stay away! Jeetu, stop it. -Sir, I'm Reshma's school friend. -Don't show off your English. -You keep meeting Reshma on the sly. -You have a dirty mind. -I won't let you see her. -Uncouth lout! Me? Uncouth? -You villager. -Stop your English! -You're sick. -Will you run to your mother? -He's an illiterate fool. -You got fired, didn't you? -I'll bury you alive. -Like hell you will! This is my sir's house. Jeetu! Daddy! Daddy. You scared? You're my brave soldier. Yes, sir. But don't leave me alone. It's your duty to protect me. Very well. Was I abandoned for no reason? Why, Mama? So that we could find you and you could choose us. Arun? Arun, can you hear me? -Daddy has had a stroke. -A stroke? -I'm taking him to the hospital. -Mama, don't worry, I'm coming. Isn't Adi there? -Hello, Dad. -Where the hell were you, Adi? How could you leave your grandparents all alone? We're at Heathrow. Tell Grandma we're taking off in 30 minutes. Dad... -Arun... -I'm on the flight. Not to worry. He's gone. Daddy is no more. Arun slapped him! -The gentle star became a wrestler? -You think that's funny? Indu, what came over Arun yesterday? He has never... What happened, Indu? What's going on? -Reshma? -Here he is. Where were you? Kamal and Uncle are on their way. Payal and Sameer too. Please get breakfast ready for everyone. Arun. Arun. What's wrong? Arun! Make breakfast for everyone. Divya, your jacket design will make great tiles. Aunty, you're too much! Reshma, did you add chilli to sir's omelette? You know everything. -Want some fruit juice? -Juice? I need a shot. -Started already? -Want a shot? -No, Aunty. Not for me. -Kids today are so boring! Tell me. Why are you giving an interview at Kishore's company? If you need a job, join your papa. What about your app? Neena! Coming! Come on, Reshma. Ankur rang me up, but I didn't answer, Amu. Was your phone off? He was asking... I'll take that painting with me. -Thank you, Reshma. -Why did Papa call us all today? Come and sit, Indu. Aunty, let's answer this quiz. Divya, I was going to tell you about the interview. Adi, not now. Where is Jeetendra? He's been missing since morning. Param hasn't said a word either. Who knows where Jeetu's gone. Mama, among your house deeds, we found this. In Daddy's handwriting. His Will. And it says: "I, Prabhakar Kedarnath Batra, "being of sound mind, "declare this to be my last Will, written without coercion. "Because my wife, Kusum Batra, and I "had no children of our own, "we adopted Arun Prabhakar Batra." -Arun, my son... please let me... -"In view of the above, I have decided "that our house, Gulmohar Villa No. 1, "be given, after my death, to my real heir and blood family, "my younger brother, Sudhakar Kedarnath Batra. "After his demise, the house will go to his son, Kamal Batra. "As long as Kusum Batra is alive, she may live in Gulmohar Villa No.1, "without anyone's permission or facing any hindrance. "After the demise of Kusum Batra, "this property must be given to Sudhakar Batra. "I am confident that our adopted son, Arun Prabhakar Batra, "or any member of his family will have no objection. "If anyone contests my decision, "this Will must be regarded as my last Will. "Witness 1: Sudhakar Batra. "Witness 2... "Kusum Batra." Arun, my son. Please. I want to explain. "An adopted son!" Yes, I was adopted. What was I thinking? And there I was trying to save our home. How could I save something... that was never mine? -I belong to no one. -What are you saying, Arun? Maybe that's why you kept me away from the house sale. No, brother. There's some misunderstanding. What's going on? Please say something. Papa, what's all this? Arun, this is your house. This Will... It's nonsense. Arun, my brother, seriously, I knew nothing about it. We're all one family. We owe you. I have a meeting. I must go. Papa-ji. File, please. Don't create a scene now. Arun, please don't be offended. -I apologise on my father's behalf. -Kamal! No need to make me the villain. This isn't my Will. It's my elder brother's. He wrote it. Papa, who is all this for? -Answer me! -Answer you? Don't ask me. Ask his wife. She was a witness too. If anyone has any objection to the Will, then let us meet in court. -What is all this, Papa-ji? -It's in black and white. It's the only truth. A Will written behind one's back can't be called the truth. Can you handle the truth? Everyone knows, when they left Jamshedpur, I had to look after everything. My brother knew blood relations were all-important. -Blood is blood. -Sudhakar, stop! But it's the truth. You once said you found me and I chose you. All my life I believed in this lie. Arun! Arun, wait! Arun, please! Arun, believe me. I didn't hide anything from you on purpose. I didn't have the courage. In a weak moment, Daddy left this house to Sudhakar. You really think it's about this house? In a single moment, you showed me I wasn't yours. "Adopted"? Daddy never thought like that, Arun. He loved you. -It was Sudhakar-- -And you signed too. Arun, you know whatever your father gave me to sign, I signed. I never bothered to read it. When I found out, we had a huge argument. That's when he had a stroke. By the time you returned from London, he was gone. I kept trying to find the right time to tell you. But I couldn't bring myself to do it, Arun. Arun. Arun. You can't go away like this. This cursed piece of paper means nothing. You're my son. That's the only truth. Shut up! Please, just shut up! Grandma. Grandma. Indu. Everyone, please leave.

My phone battery died, so I couldn't call. I'm listening. Tell me. Talk! Indu, I... Are you out of your mind, Arun Batra? Don't we have enough crazies in this family already? -You leave home, turn off your phone. -My phone battery died. Even when you have 70% battery, you charge your phone, as though some top-secret agent was going to call you. "Phone battery died." Everyone does as they please in this family. And me, the ten-handed goddess, must handle you all. Why? Calm down, have some water. Don't break it. We'll be charged. Batra! Indu. Everything is now scattered. -Lost in a fog. -Arun. There are so many childhood photos of sons and fathers. They carry us on their shoulders. They play with us. Birthdays. Then suddenly there are no photos till the son's wedding. How do we become so distant? Daddy's dream was to own a two-storey house. Stairs joining the floors. "A house with stairs is a sign of success." We built a two-storey house. Our rooms got bigger. But who knows how we became so isolated from each other. When Arun was five, I insisted we move from Jamshedpur to Delhi. I didn't want Arun to live in that hostile environment where he was unloved. Everyone called me selfish. But I only did what any mother would have done. I was very angry and ashamed that he wrote this Will. If only I had not signed it. If only I had not stayed silent. -If only... -Grandma. I don't know why, Amu, we hesitate to tell the truth to those closest to us. Dad once gave me a bicycle. It had stabilisers on each side. We had so much fun. One day, the stabilisers were removed. I tried hard, but I could not ride the cycle. Dad held onto it from behind, but, whenever he'd let go, I'd fall. So, he just kept holding on to it. But I always knew... Dad was disappointed that his son could not even ride a cycle. To be honest, I've never really made my father proud. Divya, I want us to live apart, so I can stand on my own two feet. Do something that will make him proud. That's why I'm going for the interview tomorrow. -Adi... -Divya... it's all very tough. Money, security, rent. And us. I'm on edge. I want this uneasiness to be mine alone. And not his. I'm scared, Indu. What would life have been if I didn't have all this? After Daddy passed away, I found him. When I did, I couldn't tell anyone. I couldn't even tell him. That's him, Indu. He is my birth father. Supriya would always say we live our lives in secret. Scared of our feelings, running from ourselves. Messing up what is already messed up. She was right. Isn't it strange? Everything changed so suddenly in that house. -If I hadn't come that night-- -None of this would've happened. Do me a favour. Find him and give this to him, please. Why must I be the carrier pigeon delivering messages to lovers? Reshu, he'll come back. He won't. Men take longer to let go of their bruised ego and shame. -Jeetu? -Namaste, ma'am. Madam, I'm returning to my village tonight. You've always blessed me during Holi. Whatever happened that night, I apologise on Arun's behalf. Please, madam. It was my fault. I was shouting like an uneducated man. You've taken care of me for years. Madam, I spoke to Param. Mr. Arun didn't come home last night. I waited all night for him. I don't know... if he'll ever return. Things may never be the same again. I thought we could celebrate Holi together, gather all our memories before leaving Gulmohar. Who knew our memories would get scattered. Madam, you once said we should always choose our memories. The good ones... must be kept safe. And the others must be left behind to be forgotten. It is difficult, but we must try. Kamal, your tea. I'll come down soon. Okay, sir. Where to? I'm picking up a file from Kusum, then I'll see my lawyer. -Neena. -Yes? There'll be dinner downstairs after they light the Holika bonfire. I can't believe this. Arun bhai didn't return home last night. You've shamed us. No dinner for me, Neena. -Let me go. -I won't! There's a limit to your ingratitude. -You've crossed every line. -Don't you dare talk to me like that! Why must I be grateful? Did Kusum do me a favour, breaking up my family? We were very happy living in the same house. It's because of her that my brother had to leave our home. I sacrificed my dreams of becoming an IAS officer and raised you all. Don't talk to me about ingratitude. I'm done. I went through very hard times. So, you want to be paid back now? Then Arun should put a price on his favours too. He helped with my son's education, my wife's surgery. Maybe someday you'll understand me. Papa, may that day never come when I understand you. May that day never come. I always wanted to go to him, talk to him and ask him. On one side of this road is his past decision that shaped me. On the other is my incomplete truth. I don't know why, Indu, I could not cross this road. I could not change anything. Because you don't want anything to ever change. You can't run away from change, Arun. That too is a truth of life. Go. -He's here. -Talk later. Brother! Let it go. This guy was divorced recently. He was feeling low, so he came to see Reshma. He thought it would make him feel better. There's nothing between them. They're just friends. There's something for you... Give it to me. Reshma sent you this. Your name is written on it. Your full name. Jeetendra Kumar. Jeetu, what's come over you? I have been watching you. I am worried! -You can't keep sulking. -Yes. -For Reshma's sake and mine! -Let's go. I've been your friend for 15 years. Come with me. -Yes, let's go. -Please. Your love story must have a happy ending. Stop, Param. I'm not a loser like you. When someone calls, should I go running? You really are an uncouth lout! What are you ashamed of? Stop asking why she'd like you. Or saying, "She's educated, I'm not." That's enough. Just think how much better life would be with her. So, make your life better. Where's the shame or fear in that? Tell me. Listen to me. Don't use your head when it comes to your heart. Got it? Jeetu. Why the hell am I mixed up in this? Open the door! Stop peeling that. We have tons to do. Where is Param? Mr. Sudhakar is here. Tell madam. I'll open the gate. Mummy-ji, Chhote Dada-ji has come. Surekha is making his tea. All the papers are here. Whatever happened yesterday-- I have always believed, no matter how the world changes, the foundation of this house would stay strong so that the people living here would never feel alone. Even in a large crowd, they must never forget they are not alone. They always have someone. Someone who they have chosen themselves. For a very long time, there were things no one has told you. Things that were locked away in boxes, and everyone, especially me... just kept ignoring them. But now it's time we opened those boxes. It's time to speak the truth. Namaste, sir. Chhotu hasn't come today. My knees are weak, so I couldn't cross the road to you. Sit down. I'll get you some tea. After all these years, you crossed this road for the first time. Please sit. Why are you late? You were busy playing. I know. We must paint the wall today. The paint is in my room. -Go, get it. -Yes, sir. Wait, wait! -Have you eaten anything? -No. Go and eat inside. Go. I got this wall painted last month. I noticed it the other day. Those two thugs... Didn't the police do anything? The police don't do anything for people like us. We have to manage alone. Why alone? Don't you have any children? 55 years ago, I had a son. I wrapped him up in a red shawl and left him in a hospital's parking lot. You just left him there? Never tried to find him? Never tried to find out where or how he was? You just left him? Sir, maybe it was God's will. If only... God has nothing to do with it. We make our own choices. I'll go... Sir, do you have any children? You must wish all the happiness in the world for them. I wished him to be happy too. From that day to this. I wanted him to have the happiness he deserved, which I could not give him. You can't just wish for your child's happiness. You have to make them happy. You can give because you have received. Miran! Where are you going? Wait. Come here. Where we are born, where we are raised could be in destiny's hands. But what we want to become and who we become... that is in our hands. Eventually we are... what we are. That is our legacy. I haven't been lenient towards my children, Sudhakar. I have only taught them to be free in life. And that's an inheritance you cannot leave on a piece of paper. I have a degree in computer engineering. And an MBA. I've been an entrepreneur for the last 2 years. The bright young minds of India, huh? But your app didn't work out. Am I right? Okay, Mr. Batra, -your brother... Cousin, right? -Yes. Kishore Batra. Because of his recommendation, we called you here. But we don't want people joining us because of our attractive pay package and then go home and put more energy into their start-ups. We take good care of our employees so they can help our company grow. If we give you this job, are you willing to give up your start-up? No. I beg your pardon. -Excuse me. -What? I'm so sorry. Can I borrow Aditya for two minutes? What's happening? -I'm so sorry, ma'am. Just 2 minutes. -Who are you? Adi! What's happening over here? Sorry. What "sorry," Mr. Batra? -Are you crazy? -Listen to me. You don't need to do this. We can manage for a while, Adi. No more fancy dinner dates. We'll go to Himachal instead of Switzerland for our holidays. Affordable, beautiful, cheerful. At least you'll do what you really want to, Adi. Don't give up now. I know we keep trying and we keep falling. But, if we fall, we must stand up again, right? Cycling isn't rocket science. -What if I don't get the investment? -Accept your papa's money. What's all this "I won't take money from Dad; I'll do it alone"? That's so 1970s. Even Hindi films have moved on. Don't you think Papa would be proud to be a part of your dreams, Adi? Life goes by too quickly. We can't waste it. Trust me! We'll get by. Just go in and say no. Is this some kind of a joke? -Ankur. -What? So, now you're in love with a girl? If you love, you love, Ankur. Nothing else matters. What about our love? A lie? Miss Ghalib Batra-ji, you've written a lovely song. Fits perfectly on the metre. Ankur, let's go. We're getting late. We're next. Let's rock. Everybody, give it up for Nisa and Dhruv Shetty! Ankur. Ankur. Ankur, listen. What? I'm sorry. The king of the D.U. music circuit! Ankur!

We did not build it with bricks and mortar but with loving relationships. Relationships that were not made with blood but with our hearts. But how could you understand that?
