[MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] - Love, your friends are just outside. - Don't mind them. By the way, love, the carpenter texted that some woods in the house are infested with termites. Tell him to apply a termiticide to stop the spread of infestation. It's okay. I already informed him. And tell him to apply a generous amount. I'll drop by tomorrow and give him money. - No, love. Let me pay for it this time. - I said I will handle it. I'm the man. It's my obligation to provide for us, okay? Please give me what I want. This will be quick. - This will be quick. - I'm not in the mood. Love, I'm also tired. Love, I don't want it. Please, even just for a few minutes. Love, please. Love, I'm tired. Stop it. Love, please. I'm tired. Ouch! Love! I said I'm tired! Ouch! Love, please. Love, your friends are here. Stop it! Love! Stop it! Make some moans to bring me some pleasure. You're so frigid. I said I'm not in the mood. Fine! Enough! It's been years already, but you're still acting that way! Everything depends on your mood! Love, sorry. I'm really sorry. Fix yourself. My friends might see you like that. I'm sorry. You're looking in low-end places that's why you also get cheap women. Look at Paula. She's not only beautiful, but also caring. Bro, not me. I already have a girlfriend again. Is she also good in the kitchen? In household chores? In the kitchen, in the bathroom… And even on top of the table! Have a shame on my fiancée. She's not used to your vulgarity! Sorry. Love, the dinner is ready. Caloy, Bryan, come on and eat. Okay, love. We'll be right there. Let's just continue this later. Paula's dish might get cold. You know for sure how great she is in cooking. That's how much our friend loves you. He's always proud of you. He's giving you his all that's why he has nothing left for others. It means he has no time to look for another woman, right? This is my send-off celebration and you're already drunk. Love, we'll have dinner. But can you get us more drinks? Please? Okay. Thank you! Your fiancé is unbelievable. He really lets you commute? That's okay. He needs to impress their captain before boarding the ship for promotion. Well, that's what he really likes about you, always a good follower. I just hope that he's making up to you by satisfying you in bed. Shush! Maila, please lower your voice. Someone might hear you. We did it again last night. Then, why don't you have the after sex glow? Maybe because it's just a quickie? Besides, I'm not in the mood. When are you going to be in the mood? Aren't you sexually attracted to Logan anymore? Or maybe you're no longer sexually compatible? Is that even more important than my efforts for him? In loving and taking care of him? Maila, Logan understands my limitations. Madonna-whore syndrome. He already perceives you as his pure and loving fiancée, so he doesn't wish to ever degrade you. Instead, he will look for his whore to satisfy his sexual desires. Look at me. Dignified attorney in the streets but still… A slutty girlfriend in the sheets. So, tell me, what should I do? Do something crazy. And look for a guy who can give you so much pleasure. I love Logan. He's a good provider and he has plans for our future. You know what? This is no big deal. If you say so. But if you don't want him to look for another woman, then push the envelope more. If you're not in the mood, adjust. You should take over the situation, so that you're in control of your own pleasure. You really have a foul mouth. Alright. Class, that's it for tonight. Please don't forget your paper next week. And reminder, don't be late. Class dismissed! Bye, Ma'am! Push the envelope more. If you're not in the mood, adjust. You should take over the situation, so that you're in control of your own pleasure. [PHONE RINGING] Hey, Caloy? Is Logan with you? Paula? Oh, Paula! No. Why? We don't have any plans to meet. He said you will spend some time with your captain. Oh, right! Yes, we did that earlier. Maybe he's on his way home. Please keep me posted. I've been trying to reach him, I'm just worried. Logan, it's my turn. That's my girlfriend, remember? Is that Bryan? Caloy, is Logan with you? Why did he call out Logan's name? Caloy, answer me! Caloy, are you all fooling me?! What? Oh, please. Paula, we can't do that to you. Just calm down. He's on his way. [AGITATED RINGING OF THE DOORBELL] Logan! Don't you want it anymore?! Let him be. I'm your boyfriend, you must please me. - I knew it! Caloy was lying! - Love?! - Where is Caloy?! Caloy! - We just had few drinks. Logan, is that your girlfriend? Will she join us? Logan, what's the meaning of this?! You're all disgusting! Don't make a scene here. They might hear you from other floors. Fuck you! Is this what I get after being nice to you?! - I said enough! - You fucking betrayed me! Fuck all of you! [SOBBING] Don't you feel disgusted with what you've been doing?! Paula, it's just sex. And my friends know my needs. They're just helping me. They are helping you to cheat on me using Bryan's girlfriend! Their relationship is not serious! So, it's just okay for his friends to share?! My gosh, Logan! I thought you've changed! But you've become even worse! Before you criticize me, just remember all the things I've done for you! Actually, you're the one who has shortcomings between the two of us. Look, I love you. I come home to you. You're the one I'm going to marry. I put all my money for the renovation of the house you inherited which will be our future home. I just tried to do it with another woman. But why do I look like an evil person?! So, what do you want me to do? Just close my eyes while you're cheating on me?! Paula, you're not the real victim here. It's not fair to wait for you just when you feel like doing it or just when you're available. If you don't want me to keep it a secret, just let me do what I want. We're already in this relationship for five years. Open relationships are common these days. Or swinging. Maybe that could help us. You know, our relationship can be destroyed if I agree to your terms. Logan, please. Please give me one more chance. I will change. I will fix myself for you. I'll give you whatever you want. Okay. Let's see when I get back. But if nothing changes, you should agree to my terms. I love you, baby. Shush! Keep quiet. My officemates might hear you. They just went out for lunch. [PHONE RINGING] Logan already gave me an ultimatum. I should satisfy him, or it will be an open relationship. I knew this day would come. So, what's your plan? Honestly, I don't know. Research? Do you think that the cats on roofs read books? No! They let their libido guide them. What? Don't tell me I should have sex with another man. If I do that, I would already be cheating. Sex is just sex if there are no emotions involved. Do you want to lose Logan? Think about it. Then, get back to me. Okay? Okay. Bye. Ma'am, go on. I said don't call me "Ma'am" when it's just the two of us, right? Sorry, baby. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC CONTINUOUSLY PLAYING] [MUSIC FADES] [WATER RUNNING] [SOFT TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Ma'am, it's already full of rust, that's why it's clogged. I'll just check this closely, if it needs to be replaced. Sure. If only we could also easily replace our spouses. You know what, my wife already wants to replace me. But that's life. Have some water. Thank you. Are you already married, Ma'am? I have a fiancé. Fiancé? Oh no. Don't get married just like that. It will only cause you problems. It needs to be replaced, Ma'am. Okay. I'll just get some money. Feels hot, I do not. It's all about sex. Oh! That's for my research. I'm actually a teacher. Okay. Here. Alright. Ma'am, just contact this number. Is this yours? Just in case you have a special kind of pipe with clogs. Well, obviously, I can't handle that. He is good and an expert when it comes to clogs. I'll come back later with your change. [MESSAGE ALERT TONE] Remember the rumors before that the signages of plumbers on electrical posts are for extra service? What if... Should I really reach to that point? [MESSAGE ALERT TONE] No harm in trying. Just be careful with your nosy neighbors! Bring him at your under renovation house. Good luck! Hi, good evening! There are problems with my pipe. At 1529 Gemini St. Daang Bago. By the way, I'm Paula Dimaagos. [MESSAGE ALERT TONE] K. [DOORBELL RINGING] Hi, I'm Gimo. Sorry about earlier. I have a client, so I wasn't able to reply properly. Come in. The “Plumber” just arrived! What should I do? Help! Do you want some juice or water? No, thanks. I'm okay. I just came here to unclog the pipe. Oh? Are you okay? Sorry, I'm not really used to this. Sorry about that. I got used to not talking to clients beforehand. But actually, my godfather taught me to establish rapport to people for them to be comfortable with me. Your godfather during your Baptism or is it a code name? During Baptism. I mean Confirmation. I'm staying with him. I learned from him how to do carpentry, machine repairs, and even plumbing until I have my own savings. He already owns a car wash and car repair shop. He's my idol! I see. Family? Do they know about your job? I'm actually single. But then, I don't have my parents anymore. How about you? What's keeping you busy? I'm an assistant professor at a university. I'm currently taking my Master's degree in Behavioral Science. And I'm also writing a book. Assistant professor? Yes. So, there's a main professor teaching you whom you're assisting with? You know what, you're funny. Of all the things I've told you, you only remembered about the “assistant” part. That's just a term for entry level professors. In three years, I can be promoted to associate professor which has a higher salary. I didn't know you're a big time! Okay, let's be serious. So, why do you need my services? You don't look like someone who's in need of my services. Wait, are you having sexual problems with your partner? Fiancé, actually. How did you know? Well, that's one of the usual reasons. Maybe you're both getting bored. He said I can't satisfy him. Well, I'm doing this to save my relationship. Please don't judge me. Honestly, everyone has their flaws. Besides, when you're with me, there'll be no judgment. And don't get pressured. Let's take it slow. Let's just do whatever makes you comfortable. First, you have to relax. Feel every breath we take. Don't be nervous. Remember, the goal of sex is... pleasure. Second, you should know what you really want. Focus on your own pleasure. To where you want to be touched and where you will get pleasure. Is it here? Third, You should know what your partner really wants. After he has satisfied your sexual desires, It's your turn to fulfill his needs. What do you want? Wait. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC CONTINUOUSLY PLAYING] [OST PLAYING: "PASILIP" BY ZO ZO] [MUSIC FADES] Good morning! Sorry if ever I have forced you last night. I wanted everything that happened. Thank you for taking care of me. We need to go. The workers might arrive anytime soon. [GIGGLING] So, that's how it is. I've never experienced anything like that. How big? See this? Oh my goodness! It's been so long since I've seen you this happy. I didn't know all you need was wild foreplay and a huge cock to enjoy sex. I don't know. The way Gimo touches and takes control is different. He's gentle, yet he's so passionate. Do you want to do it again? [LAUGHING] Maila, please be honest with me. Am I a bad person? Can I do it again? Technically, you're just doing this to save your relationship. If you enjoyed more and had more pleasure, you'll satisfy Logan even more when he comes back. Cheers! [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Gimo, hello? Sorry. Did I wake you up? Do you have any free time this week? I'm embarrassed that I made you go right away last time. I want to cook for you. What's your favorite dish? Sour soup. I'm free the next day. Great! Hold on, your girlfriend might get mad. I'm not committed. Besides, no one would take me seriously if they knew what I'm doing. You know, Gimo, the right girl will understand. Usually, they're calling me to have sex. But you're calling for advice and dish. You know what? It's just either of the two. It's either you're kind or you were not satisfied with my services that's why you'll just cook for me. Hey, I'm really a kind person. So, did you enjoy it? Wow! You're phishing information. But seriously, of course. But not just with that. Honestly, I enjoyed talking to you and spending time with you. Of course, I also enjoyed it. With that kind of beauty? If you could only see yourself the way I see you. Oh, you. Stop flattering me. Your eyes and your smiles… Are very expressive. Your lips are very red. Your neck and your nape are so attractive while you're wetting in the kitchen. I can still recall everything when I was kissing you. The warmth of your body while we're in each other's arms. You're looking at me while I'm on top of you. I can still hear your moans. Paula, imagine that I'm there with you. And my hands are caressing you, going to your chest. Going down and down… And down there. Just keep doing it as long as you want. Don't ever stop, Paula. Paula, I'll wait for your text. I can't wait to see you again. Thank you! Wow! This is good. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC CONTINUOUSLY PLAYING] Where do you see yourself five years from now? I'm sure I have already finished my Master's degree by then. And by that time, I've already published my book. Of course. That's for sure. You just don't know how much you amaze me when you're on your online class or when you're writing your book. I just feel so proud that I met someone who's not only intellectual but also excellent. You always flatter me. How about you? I hope by then I already have my own business, or I'm a co-owner of my godfather's workshop. I can make my simple dream happen, right? Yes. Of course. That's what I like about you. You're hardworking, determined and you're not giving up. I still have another one. Never mind. What is it? It's nothing. Oh, come on! Tell me or else, I'll be upset. I'm about to say that I also imagine the two of us having a road trip together. Then, we'll go driving with my own car. We will hold hands while the windows are open. But you're probably married by then. So, never mind. Time flies so fast! I can't believe it's been three months already. Here. I gave you an increase. I remember I gave you a late payment last time. No need. You've already helped me a lot. Besides, I'm also earning in the repair shop and car wash. Just accept it and add it to your savings. Also, to make our road trip happen sooner. No judgments, remember? The way I see you would never change no matter what you do to earn money. Just let me wash your car. And get ready for tonight. I'll be the one to cook for our dinner. [ALERT TONE RINGING] Be there in a while. I'm so excited for your dish. Logan? Oh? Why do you look like you've seen a ghost? Drink some water. Why didn't you tell me that you'll be arriving today? I miss you, love. I'm happy you're back. Really? Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [MUSIC FADES] That's so appetizing. Let me serve you. No need. Have a seat. By the way, why are you dressed earlier? Are you going somewhere? I'm just fitting it. I'm afraid it might get old inside the cabinet. You look so hungry, love. This is your fault. You made me so hungry. Does it mean that we're okay now? Yes. Why do you seem different? You know very well that I'm willing to do anything for you. I told you, love. I can really change. Love, now that we're okay, maybe it's best if we can start working on our future. So, how is the house renovation going? Actually, it's almost done. It's a bit messy but we can already move in. So, what are we waiting for? Finally, the start of our forever. I'll just get you some water. Yes, please. Your sour soup is so good! [PHONE VIBRATING] Love, here. Thank you. You're welcome. Yummy! Sorry, bro. This is all I can give you. Just pay her right away, so she would stop bothering you. She's really asking for money now that I have nothing left. I really need to get that promotion to have a bonus. Where will you get the rest of it? I'll go ahead. Won't you join us? Won't you? As what you've said Paula already changed. Can you really say no to this? You can watch. Let's see how long can you resist. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC CONTINUOUSLY PLAYING] Paula, please reply. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hello, Paula? How are you? You haven't reached out to me again. Logan has returned, Gimo. I'm sorry if it took a while before I let you know. But we can't see each other anymore. I can't thank you enough. I was looking for a solution to my problem but... I've found more than that. I've found a friend. Someone who knew right from the start that I only did this for Logan. Gimo, we're now okay. But this has to end. Goodbye, Gimo. At least you and Logan are finally okay. Who would have thought that hiring someone for sex would do wonders for you? Gimo is not just a sex worker. Defensive? Fine. Like what? He's been my friend. A friend who fucks you?! Forget about it. It's over. But? But… I feel like Logan is no longer the problem here. It's me who's longing for something else. And Gimo is the only one who could give you what you're looking for? I'm not really sure. I feel like something's missing. It feels different. Ma'am? Here are the documents from Atty. Buenaventura. Put it here. I thought you were just “fuck buddies.” Why does it seem more than that? That's none of your business! Just mind your own! Let's just talk about Gimo. What should I do? We have already replaced the old locks on the second floor. Sorry, it's still a bit messy. Actually, we want to move in now. There are still a lot of things to do. Maybe you would like to look for an all-around handyman to make all the work easier. I'm still waiting for the reply of one of my workers. Wouldn't it take us longer if we're going to wait for him? Oh, love. I know someone. Hold on. Here. Tell him that it was me who referred him. Sure. Why isn't it that hard? Maybe you're not in the mood. I'm just preoccupied. Maybe we should just do it next time. If only I wasn't your regular client, I would have been mad at you a long time ago. You've been ignoring my calls for quite some time. Then now… This? I'm really sorry about that. Get dressed. I'm going to take a shower. [MESSAGE ALERT TONE] You were referred by Ma'am Paula Dimaagos. As an all-around house handyman. You may report at their residence tomorrow. I will be sending the address. You seem young. Are you skilled? I need someone who can be trusted. Sir, I'm already 27 years old. I was working since I was young. Besides being a skilled plumber, I can also do the carpentry, repair, basically everything. Do you have your own family? I need a stay-in handyman here. You won't have any problem with that. That's good. After all, women just cause us problems at times. Not everyone is lucky like me who have someone like her. I hope I could also have someone like Ma'am. Are you okay, love? Okay, you're hired. You may use the vacant room there. You may use all the things here. The TV, washing machine, food in the fridge, except for her. She's off-limits. [CHUCKLING] Don't be late tomorrow. This morning you started at around 9 AM. Sir, sorry if we were late this morning. But don't worry, it won't happen again. What's wrong with you, Gimo?! You're here to work and not to pull me whenever you want. I'm sorry. I just thought you missed me. Of course not! We are just in need of a handyman. I wanted to help and give you a job. That's it! My godfather offered a big project at the province but I chose this over that. Then, you're just going to treat me this way. I just realized that you're also a good liar. Me? A liar?! Then, why are you affected? Your lips are pouting terribly again. Your mind is full of imaginations! Let me go! Or else I'll scream! I'm asking you… Why did you ask me to come here? Again, I just wanted to help. If I know, you just wanted to see me again. I've been longing to see you too, Paula. Didn't you miss me? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] Come in. There you go. Good thing we have skillful workers. They were able to retain the original look of the house. See? The first floor is already livable after cleaning it. For the second floor, maybe it will take another month. Are we back to being high school? Do you think I can't notice the way you look at each other? Before, you're always not in the mood. But now, you have two men in your life. Keep your voice down. Maila, it's as if you're telling me that I intended to have them both. Well, Logan is giving me everything, especially when he came back. I felt that he's really making up to me. But Gimo is such a sweet guy, caring and most of all, he listens. You know what, you won't look for another if you're contented with what you have, right? So, you really need to think about it because the day might come when you really need to choose. [MESSAGE ALERT TONE] Congrats on chapters one to three. I emailed you my notes but it's just for minor revisions. It's my editor. My gosh! My first three chapters passed! Congrats! Finally, your book is coming to a reality! Thank you! But keep your tone down. Logan is just in the room. Is he the only achiever here? It's not like that. I just want him to get his promotion before we celebrate. What calls for a celebration? Your fiancée is soon-to-be a publish writer. Oh, love, it's just the first three chapters. It's still a long way to go. Congrats, love. Thank you! Have you cooked already? I'm hungry. Yes. I'll set the table for you. Maila, stay here for lunch. Next time. I still have a meeting with a client. Oh, okay. Bye! Bye! [PHONE RINGING] Love, your phone is ringing! [PHONE CONTINUOUSLY RINGING] Logan! Someone's calling. It might be from work! [PHONE CONTINUOUSLY RINGING] [PHONE CONTINUOUSLY RINGING] [PHONE CONTINUOUSLY RINGING] You can never hide from me no matter where you go. The money you sent is not enough! Give me the rest or else I will follow you. Hello? Who's this? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Cheers! Love, I've been calling you. Your music is so loud. Why are you drinking? Why? Is it wrong to unwind a little? Right, Gimo? [MUSIC PLAYING] Hold on. Why is your phone under our bed? How did you find it? I've been looking for it. Someone called asking for payment. It's nothing. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Why are you not wearing our ring? It's here, so that it's closer to my heart. Gimo! This is the kind of woman that you should be looking for. She's not only beautiful, but also great in bed! Logan, you're drunk already. Let's go inside and talk about the person who's asking for money. You're so annoying! I told you it's nothing! We're still drinking! Okay, fine. When you get promoted, pay her right away, okay? But I was not promoted! So, what are you going to do? Just because you'll soon publish a book? Huh? You've become so arrogant already?! Keep this in mind, no one reads books anymore! Gimo, please leave us. Gimo, stay there! Why? Don't you want our plumber to see your arrogance?! Love, sorry. I didn't know that you didn't get the promotion. I will help. Besides, I have savings. So now, you're also belittling me?! Do you think I can't handle my own problem?! For the longest time that we've been together, you never had any problem because I gave you everything! And now that you've gained a small success, you think you can do everything I've done?! You're selfish! Logan, you're getting out of hand! Don't turn your back on me! I'm still talking to you! Don't you dare meddle between us! Logan! Madam, are you okay? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FADES] I'm sorry about that. I snapped. Why did you even meddle? I will stay silent for as long as you want. But the moment I see that you're hurting, that's a different story. Even if you have a ring on your finger, he has no right to lay his hands on you. Logan didn't mean to do that. Even so. If I'm your boyfriend, I'll never hurt you and I'll never make you cry. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] Paula… Get back to sleep to get rid of your hangover. [MUSIC FADES] Love… Love, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I just don't want to cause you any problem. Logan, we're equal. Let me help you if you have any problem. Love, I'm a man. I can handle it on my own. And please don't touch my phone again. Please? It wasn't my intention. I thought it was a call to tell you that you're promoted. Okay, it's over. Let's just forget about it. By the way, did something happen last night that I don't remember? Because my face really hurts. Your face hit the floor when you went unconscious. You weren't careful when drinking. Okay. Love, get dressed. Just tell me whatever you want in the mall. I will buy everything to make it up to you. - I'll get dressed. - Okay. Paula, take a break. Logan doesn't remember that you punched him last night. So, just don't mention it. It seems like you've shopped a lot earlier. That is Logan's way of making up to me. I'm sorry. I can't give you fancy things. This is enough for me. Honestly, sometimes I'm hoping that you'll choose me in the end even if I know that I'm a loser. I'm not even part of your plans, right? So, please, just let me love you. I'm sorry. I got carried away. I'm engaged. You know that. Yes, I know. That's why I'm contented to be your listener, your friend, and your lover. You know that it's not like that, Gimo. And you're more than that to me. Love, where are you? Are you done writing? Be there in a minute. Hey, Gimo! Come, join us. No thanks. You go ahead. You should never refuse the food being offered to you, that's a sign of bad luck. Love, please get a plate for Gimo. What are you waiting for? Stop staring at each other, the food will get cold. Dig in. By the way, Gimo, did you come inside our room the other night? Yes, sir. I helped madam to carry you. At least that gives me a sense of assurance that someone is helping my fiancée when I'm not around. I'll just have some bread. I still have things to do. This is enough. Thank you. Logan, what are you trying to imply to Gimo? By the way, how did you meet him? Aren't you the one who recommended him? From another plumber, the one who was working in our apartment before, remember? Actually, Gimo is really a plumber but he is really hardworking. What I mean is, how did you know that he's good? Did you just guess? Are you satisfied with his work? Logan, what's your point? Let me get this straight, Paula, did you have sex with Gimo? You have a very filthy mind! No! Happy?! Can you please stop thinking that way? You're my fiancé, remember? Paula, who should it be? Hurry! Who's the first person that comes to your mind? Maila, this is not a game! It's not a game since it's already getting serious. Paula, you need to choose. You know, I really don't need to. Logan is my fiancé. So, what's Gimo's role in your life? You also have feelings for him, right? See? You really have to choose. If it's only about sex, then by all means, even if you have a threesome, it will be fine. But we're talking about your feelings here. So, who would it be? I don't know. Of course, you do! Stupid! Don't be scared of what other people might think. It's none of their business. You can change the course of your life. What matters is who can really make you happy. Paula, more people would get hurt in the long run. Paula, Paula, Paula! Paula, come on! You need to wake up! You need to fix this before things get even worse. It can't be. Logan and I have been together for five years now. We're such a perfect couple in everyone's eyes. He never failed me. He never neglected me. He's not perfect and I also have my own flaws. But I also feel how deep is Gimo's feelings for me. He loves me without asking anything in return. He's reliable. He's thoughtful. He's not judging me. He's trustworthy. Paula, Paula! Paula, come on! Who should it be? Paula, you have to decide now who are you going to choose between the two of them. [SCREAMS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FADES] Those kids are so cute! Who are they? They are my colleague's children. That's their mom. [SIGHS] Honestly, love, I'm jealous of them. After we get married, let's have children. The house will get messy but that would be fun, right? [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] I love you, Paula. [OST PLAYING: "PASILIP" BY ZO ZO] [MUSIC FADES] Paula, I love you. Please stay here till morning. I can't. Gimo, we can't do this anymore. Is that so easy for you to let go? Let's put an end to this. I've already indulged myself too much. I don't want to hurt Logan anymore. How about me? I don't want to give you false hopes. Gimo, let's end this. Am I even complaining? Fine. You can hurt me all you want if that's the only way for you to stay. We should have ended this the moment Logan came back. Am I forcing myself to you? It's on you, Paula. You know deep in your heart that you also wanted to be with me. Yes, I admit. I also have feelings for you. But Gimo, this is wrong. You never heard anything from me. I kept silent all along as I watch the two of you together even if it hurts me so bad. Then, you'll just throw it all away? [SNIFFS] [SIGHS] Gimo, if only our situation had been different, I would never let you go. But I have to do what is right. I have to stay with Logan and build a future with him. Gimo, I'm sorry. Paula… Love? Love. You must be thinking something deep. I'm working on a difficult chapter. By the way, have you seen Gimo? I haven't seen him since this morning. Oh, Gimo? Yes. He had a family emergency back in the province. So, he needed to leave. Don't worry, he only left few things undone. Besides, the contractor said that he's sending someone tomorrow. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Just take some rest. You're always welcome in our workshop. Thanks, godfather. Next time, don't let your emotions get into you. You'll just end up getting hurt. Just forget about her. I've fallen deeply for her. No matter what you do, you can never measure up to her. Love, have you seen this viral bride? Look! She chopped off her gown after the wedding to wear for their honeymoon. How cute! I was thinking what should my gown look like? Should it be long, short or just the right length? Do you think the church will allow a short gown? I won't give you what you want until you give me the rest of the money. I've already sent you a large amount of money! You're taking too much advantage of me! Love, by the way, my certificate of “No Marriage Record” already arrived. I wonder why they didn't send yours. I requested for both of our certificates at once. Anyway, have you seen the house title? You hide from us for so many years, so stop complaining! You're lucky that I'm not showing up to your house! Love, are you listening? I don't know. It's inside a brown envelope with green sticky notes. I said I haven't seen it! And why are you suddenly rushing the wedding?! What's the rush? This is actually part of our plans, right? [SIGHS] Come here. I'm just afraid that I couldn't afford yet the kind of wedding that you deserve. I want everyone to envy you. Love, can we postpone this wedding? Please? Okay. I'm planning to have an ocular inspection of the churches. Do you want to come with me? Let's have a road trip. Maila, are you listening? Mike was upset. He thinks that I'm keeping our relationship a secret. Anyway, I thought the wedding plans are on hold? I know Logan. He changes his mind easily. At least if he's in the mood again, our wedding is ready. Please be honest. Are you rushing to get married to patch up the memories of Gimo? Of course not! A week ago, Logan and I even talked about our plans of having kids. Do you think he has other reasons why he suddenly changed his mind? I don't know. Maybe he's just overwhelmed with the house renovation. Are you sure about that? I know that I made the right decision in choosing him. Love, what are you doing? Love. I'm just fixing something. And I also washed the dishes. Love, get some rest first because later you'll get tired in bed. Okay. Love, your phone is ringing! Love! George already received the title. You've probably received the money. You better make sure that this is a clean title. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Love, what are you doing at the sink? Are you married? What? You must be dreaming. Just answer me! No! Three years?! You got married in the middle of our relationship?! It was just a one time incident but then, she got pregnant. Her family forced me, so I was left with no other choice. Is she the woman you're checking online?! Are those your kids?! A one time incident but you had two kids?! I wanted to annul her for a long time but she didn't want to. So, she's asking me a big amount of money for her to agree. Maybe you're not providing for your kids! Is that the reason why you pawned the house title?! How dare you, Logan! It's been five years, Logan! I've been considerate of you for five long years! I gave you everything! And yet you made me your mistress! I will sue you for stealing and pawning the title that does not belong to you! And don't expect that promotion because I'm going to ruin your reputation! Look at you now! You're so arrogant! I've done all of that for you! Then now, you're blaming it all on me?! You're just doing that for yourself! I thought because you were a good provider and you have plans for our future, everything will be okay. But I was wrong. Logan, for five fucking years, I took care of you! I even lost myself! Is that all because of Gimo?! Do you think I didn't notice the way he looks at you?! Don't you dare mention his name because he's a better man compared to you! I loved you... but you're also causing me too much trouble! I've never left you! I stayed with you! Then what?! You would just threaten me?! That's enough! I said enough! Enough! [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Damn you! You're an asshole! [CHOKING] Fucking asshole! Let me go! [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] Shut up! Just shut up! [SOBBING] [MUSIC FADES] Yes. Okay. I already contacted the Pawnee of the house title. I've informed him what really happened. We'll just get back to him for the payment. What's your plan with the house? I'm going to sell it. I'll just go back to the old apartment. Let's just wait for the report of the medico legal expert. But with my statement, it's very clear that what you did was just a self-defense. I'm the lawyer of Miss Dimaagos. I'll answer any question you have for her. Janet? By the way, I'm… Paula? I know who you are. I think you're the one who called Logan last time. Janet, I'm sorry. If I only knew, I won't take him from you and your children. No. It's not your fault. You're also a victim. What happened to Logan is not enough to make him pay for everything that he has done to us. So, what's your plan? Are you going to get back with him? My children need their father. How about you? You're finally free. What's your plan now? Excuse me. I've been looking for you. Finally, you can now have a peace of mind. There's no more problem. We're both free, Paula. I also thought that way, but then… I've been thinking about what should be done. But I just keep on having the same answer. You need some time alone for yourself… For you to be strong and whole again. Gimo… You deserve to be loved wholeheartedly and undivided. And I can't give it to you now after all that has happened. I also wanted to give you everything but I can't do that if this is all I am. I hope the right time for us would come someday. I will pray that we would see each other again when we're both ready for each other. [SOBBING] Congrats! I'm so proud of you! After all that you've been through, you were able to write a book! Thank you! Thanks to the both of you for celebrating with me. I really appreciate it. Good thing, your friend here doesn't hide our relationship anymore. Because you already finished your internship. Besides, I realized that it's none of their business because what I feel for you is true. I love you! I love you too, baby! Sorry, PDA! Mike has lots of friends who are single. Do you want to meet them? I'd rather have “Books before boys”. Why don't you call Gimo?! I did. But I think he already changed his number. If we are really meant for each other, as he said, we will meet again no matter what. We'll just get some wine. - Sure. - Let's go! Can you please sign my book? Sure! You've changed your look. My life has improved a little. I was able to save some money for the co-ownership of my godfather's businesses. I'm really sorry if it took me a while. Your timing is just perfect.
