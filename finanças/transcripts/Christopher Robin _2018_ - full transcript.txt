Listen to each other! ♫ It's more fun with two It's always me and you ♫ ♫ And together we will stay ♫ ♫ Through warm or stormy weather ♫ ♫ We'll always be together ♫ RABBIT: Concentrate! ♫ Forever ♫ ♫ For within my heart If we should ever part ♫ ♫ We'll be never far away from each other ♫ ♫ We'll be never far away ♫ Oh! What's he doing? Big finish! That'll do! That'll do! Please! (CLANGING) I sounded incredible! Tiggers are excellent singers. It's lovely having you all here. Always very moving, that number. Now, um, we all know why we're here. (FLY BUZZING) It's a sad day. But I have asked my friend, Eeyore... That's me. (RABBIT CLEARS THROAT) I have asked him to propose a rissolution. Uh, it's "resolution." Yes, that's what I said. What's a "rissolution?" After the poem, dear. (EEYORE CLEARS THROAT) "Christopher Robin is going. "At least I think he is. "Where? Nobody knows. "But he is going." I mean, he goes. "Do we care? We do. Very much. "Anyhow, we send our love. "End." If anyone wants to clap, now is the time to do it. PIGLET: Yay! KANGA: Wonderful! (ALL APPLAUDING) POOH: Christopher. RABBIT: There he is! He's here! That was a lovely poem, Eeyore. EEYORE: It was nothing. Oh, sorry. POOH: It's just too bad it's over. I would've liked it to go on for a while longer. RABBIT: Now, now, let's not get carried away there, Pooh Bear. That was plenty long enough. For let's all remember, I commissioned it. Based on an original idea by me. Which I suggested. OWL: After I thought of it. RABBIT: Let's not do this in public, shall we? You wide-eyed nincompoop. Christopher Robin, I made you this sack of Hundred Acre Wood haycorns. They're my very favorite snack. Wherever you may go, they'll remind you of the Hundred Acre Wood. CHRISTOPHER: Thank you, Piglet. I don't think I'll need any help remembering the Wood... but I shall treasure them. I'm gonna miss you, I am! I'm gonna miss you too, Tigger. Now, don't you go and get all growned up on us! Uh, we shall all miss the lad. As my Grandowl Osgood used to say... EEYORE: Wow! What did he used to say? I call the cherries. Extra cream for me, please. OWL: No, it wasn't that. Is it a carrot cake? Mmm. Larger. Cake is what Tiggers like best! I'm gonna go for it. (EXCITED CHATTERING) TIGGER: What is this again? (ALL MUNCHING) RABBIT: Cake, cake, cake. Will you never learn? I would prefer a lovely, crunchy carrot. What's wrong with something healthy? Good for your teeth. Sweets go right to my feets! You won't be able to stop me! Careful, Tigger. Bounce and bounce! Come on, Roo! And I'll bounce! And I'll bounce! And I'll... (SNORING) (ALL SNORING) Come on, Pooh. (POOH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Where are we going, Christopher Robin? Nowhere. Oh. One of my favorite places. EEYORE: Saddle's too tight. (SNORING CONTINUES) CHRISTOPHER: What do you like to do best in the world, Pooh? POOH: Hmm. Well... What I like best... is me and Piglet... going to see you... (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) and you say, "What about a little something?" And I say... "Well, I shouldn't mind a little something." And it being a hummy sort of a day outside. CHRISTOPHER: I like that too. But what I like doing best is nothing. How do you do nothing? CHRISTOPHER: It's when people call out... "What are you going to do, Christopher Robin?" And you say, "Oh, nothing." And then you go ahead and do it. Ah, yes. Doing nothing often leads to the very best something. CHRISTOPHER: Pooh. I'm not going to do nothing anymore. POOH: Oh. Never again? Well, they don't let you at the boarding school. Pooh... When I'm off not doing nothing, will you come up here sometimes? Just me? Where will you be? I'll be right here. But what should happen if you forget about me? I won't ever forget about you, Pooh. I promise. Not even when I'm a hundred. How old will I be then? (SIGHS) 99. Silly old bear. POOH: Hmm. 99... Christopher, come on now. CHRISTOPHER'S MOTHER: Do hurry up, darling. CHRISTOPHER'S FATHER: Christopher! Christopher Robin, your mother is in the car! You take care. CHRISTOPHER'S FATHER: Off you go, young man. Christopher Robin! Now concentrate! (THUNDER RUMBLING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) WOMAN: You're the man of the house now, dear. (GASPS) Would you like to sit down? Oh, um... Thank you. Cheeky blighter. Mmm-hmm. (BOTH CHUCKLING) (MUSIC PLAYING ON RECORD) (EVELYN LAUGHS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) EVELYN: Will you write? Of course, every day. (MAN SINGING INDISTINCTLY) ANNOUNCER: (ON RADIO) It's February 11th, 1944. Soon the nightly battle of London will be on. This has been a quiet day for us, but it won't be a quiet night. They'll destroy a few buildings, and kill a few people. Probably some of the people you... (RADIO TURNS OFF) EVELYN: (SINGING) ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ ♫ Happy birthday, dear Madeline ♫ ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ (BLOWS AIR) (EXPLOSIONS) This is Zebra-One-Charlie! (GUNS FIRING) This is Zebra-One-Charlie. Where are my reinforcements? Ah, well done. MADELINE: Mummy, when is Daddy coming home? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (EVELYN CHUCKLES) EVELYN: This is your daddy. (LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Good morning. Good morning. KATHERINE: Good morning, Mr. Robin. Good morning, Ms. Dane. Did you have a pleasant... I'd like them to reconsider... the brass fittings on the chestnut wardrobes for nickel-plated ones. KATHERINE: I'll make a note of that. CHRISTOPHER: Now, what's the holdup from Glasgow? Tanners union dispute, sir. What about Manchester? Waiting on fabric, sir. And what's Birmingham's excuse? It's just Birmingham, sir. They're always late. CHRISTOPHER: I don't need to remind you, we're under increasing pressure to cut costs! MATTHEW: Mr. Robin? Yes. If we replace the second inner bevel with beechwood... we can increase buoyancy by four percent. JOAN: And decrease weight by point-two percent. And cost? Oh, well, it might save a few pennies. Oh, keep plugging away, everyone. GILES: Bravo! That's what we like to hear. CHRISTOPHER: Oh, Mr. Winslow, I could easily have come up to your office. No, no. I love to come down here, get my hands dirty once in a while. Oh sir, that sample is, in fact, still wet. Yes. (CLEARS THROAT) The, uh, smell of the leather. The smell of hard work. Much rather be here than in my stuffy office where the boring stuff happens. (CHUCKLES) Yawn. (LAUGHS LOUDLY) This is where I belong. Down here with the real men. And women. Sorry, always forget about them. Yes, I hate offices. Give me some manual labor any day of the... (CLEARS THROAT) Let's, uh, go into your office. Yes, Mr. Winslow. Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) After you, sir. Oh, no, please. (CLATTERING) Carry on. Ah. (CLEARS THROAT) I spent all morning on that. (DOOR CLOSES) GILES: Of all my father's businesses, Winslow Luggage is the worst. Embarrassing for me, of course, but hardly surprising. There's been a war. Who has the time or the money to go on holiday these days? In short, we need to cut some costs. That's all I've been working on, sir. We've made some progress. Three percent, or thereabouts. We need to cut deeper than three percent, Robin. We're stuffed. What did they say? (WHISPERS) I can't hear. JOAN: Don't worry. I can lip read. How much deeper, sir? Twenty. Twenty! (MUFFLED) Twenty percent, that's impossible. He's saying, "Windy tent. That's an apple." What are they talking about? Perhaps it's a lunch order. Sir, your father promised these people good jobs to come home to after the war. Well, they'd do anything for this company. I'd do anything for this company. My father has called an emergency meeting on Monday. We need to produce the cuts by then. It's sink or swim. I promised my wife and daughter I'd take them away this weekend, sir. I thought you'd do anything for this company. Do you have dreams, Robin? I beg your pardon, sir? Well, I'll let you into a little secret. Dreams don't come for free, Robin. Nothing comes from nothing. And if this ship goes down, you need to ask yourself the question... "Am I a swimmer, or am I a sinker?" Well, which one are you, Robin? Well, obviously I'd like to reply that I'm a swimmer, sir. (PATS BACK) Right answer! Me too. That's why I shall be working this weekend, also. All hands on deck and all that. This may help, a list here of names. People who can walk the plank if you, um... if we don't come up with something. It's all on you, Robin. Oh, good heavens. GILES: Keep up the good work. (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) Ah, Christopher. All work and no play, eh? Ah, Cecil. Um, speaking of play, the wife and I were just talking... and hate to be a persistent Peter... but we're still waiting for that gin rummy game. Oh, yes, yes! Well, one of these days, eventually. Eager to finally see how good you are. (CHUCKLES) EVELYN: Madeline wanted to wait for you but it got so late. Yes, I'm sorry, I got held up at work. I know. Katherine rang to let me know. She also said you'd be working this weekend. I suppose you won't be coming to the cottage. (CHRISTOPHER STAMMERS) Well, it can't be helped. It never can. (CLOCK TICKING) (KNOCK AT DOOR) (DOOR OPENS) Hello. What've you got there? Oh, uh... It's yours. I found it in the attic. It has loads of things from when you were my age. Haycorns. I mean, acorns. Nothing of any great importance. Don't you think you should be doing something more useful with your time? Reading perhaps? I've already finished the book list that Grayford Prep sent. I'm way ahead. I've been very efficient. Oh, good. That's good. Yes, so there's no work to do this weekend. We can do whatever we want. We'll go back to your cottage. Play where you played. We can do puzzles, board games. Right. Um... I wanted to talk to you about that. I can't come this weekend. But summer will be over soon. I have to stay for work. You and your mother will go. I never see you. Well, I wished I didn't have to stay for work... but dreams don't come for free, Madeline. You have to work for them. Nothing comes from nothing. Do you understand? (SIGHS) I understand. I suppose you can keep these here then. Yes. Do you think you could read to me for a minute? Of course. Yes. "The Victorian Era signified "the height of the Industrial Revolution... "and was viewed as the apex of the British Empire." Oh, we've got a real good one here. "It followed the Georgian period... "and preceded the Edwardian period." Actually... Father. Yes? I'm a bit tired. Right. Yes. Um... You sure? Hmm. Of course. Well... Good night. Good night. (DOOR CLOSES) (SWITCH CLICKS) CHRISTOPHER: I've been thinking. You two don't have to go to the country tomorrow. We've been over this. She needs to play, Christopher. Not spend all of her time studying. Grayford Prep is the best! She told me she's done all the reading. Because she would do anything to please you. But there are perfectly good schools here in London... that don't require us to send her away. And come on, Christopher. You know she doesn't want to go. I went away when I was her age. It'll prepare her for the real world. Set her up for a career. Well, isn't that our responsibility to her? What? Do you even like your job? What's that got to do with anything? You're going to hit your limit. One day you're going to crack. Evelyn. Look, if I work really hard now, then in the future... our life will be... Will be what? Will be better? Worse? We don't care, we want you. This is life, Christopher. This weekend is your life. Your life is happening now. Right in front of you. Look. Hello! Yahoo. Remember me? I'm your wife. (GIGGLES) And that's another thing. I haven't seen you laugh in years. Evelyn. I want to see you have fun, sometimes. Be silly. I didn't fall for you because you had your career set up. Was it my dancing? (CHUCKLES) Actually, yes, it was... It was dancing with you. Being held by you. Look, don't make this harder on me. I am sorry. I'll take my suitcase upstairs. Where is my suitcase? I didn't bother packing it. CHRISTOPHER: Have a nice time. Goodbye. Goodbye. Take care. Hmm. CHRISTOPHER: See you soon. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (SIGHS) CECIL: We can have that game of gin rummy now that you're a Tommy-time-on-his-hands. Ah. MADELINE: Dear Father... I never knew you could draw so well. Maybe you could hang this one next to mine. Love, Madeline. (BREATHING DEEPLY) (SNORING) POOH: Honey. (MUMBLING) (CONTINUES SNORING) Honey! Where am I? I can't see anything. Oh, that's right. (CHUCKLES) Oh. Good morning, house. Oh. How are you today? Time to make myself hungry with my stoutness exercise. (SINGING) ♫ When I up, down, touch the ground ♫ ♫ It puts me in the mood ♫ ♫ When I up, down, turn around ♫ ♫ In the mood for food ♫ ♫ And I'm off, ready for my morning honey ♫ (YELPING) Ouch. Oh, some honey will make me feel better. Oh, bother. Somebody seems to have eaten all the honey. Oh. (GROANS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Hmm. Oh, my. Foggy today. If I know anything about anything... it's easy to lose your way on a foggy day. And rather hard to find the way back. Piglet always has a little smackerel of something hidden away. Piglet? It's Pooh. Are you home? It would appear not. (ECHOING) Rabbit! Are you home? It's Bear speaking. Eeyore! Where is everybody? How gloomy and sad. If only Eeyore were here to enjoy it. Hello? Anybody here? Can anybody hear me? (ECHOING) Hello? What has happened to my friends? (WHINES) Oh, dear. I appear to have reached the end... of my thoughts. (WIND HOWLING) Oh. Hmm. (SIGHS) YOUNG CHRISTOPHER: Come on, Pooh. (POOH GASPS) Christopher? Are you there? It's me. Winnie the Pooh. Are you finally home? Think, think, think. It would seem I must go forward... where I have never been... rather than backwards... where I have. Christopher Robin must help me find everybody. Or help everybody find me. That will be the order of looking for things. Christopher? Are you here? It's Pooh. (CLOCK TICKING) Hello. It's Pooh. Are you hiding? (BELL TOLLING IN DISTANCE) (YAWNING) Oh, I'm getting very sleepy. Oh. And that looks like a bed. (BELL DINGS) Where, oh, where is Christopher Robin? (KNOCKING AT DOOR) (POOH SNORING) (CHRISTOPHER EXHALES) (GRUNTS SOFTLY) (SIGHS) What to do, what to do, what to do? POOH: What to do, indeed. Pooh? Christopher Robin! No! No, no, no, no, no! (STAMMERS) You can't be here. Hmm. This can't be happening. It's stress. POOH: It's not stress. My God, I'm stressed. It's Pooh. I'm so exhausted. Evelyn warned me. I like to be warmed. Warmed and cozy. I've cracked. Oh. I've totally cracked. I don't see any cracks. A few wrinkles maybe. Pooh! You're here! How are you here, Pooh? Oh. Well, I went through the door through which Christopher Robin is known to appear. And now, I'm here! CHRISTOPHER: But the tree I remember was behind the cottage in Sussex... not here in London. I suppose it's where it needs to be. CHRISTOPHER: There's no opening. There's no door on the other side. Oh. We must not need it anymore. That's a silly explanation. Why, thank you. Are you glad to see me, Christopher Robin? CECIL: Well, hello there! Ooh, what have you got there, secret Susan? CHRISTOPHER: Uh, um... Well, it's a, it's a... a cat. Yes, definitely. Just a cat. Ooh, I love cats. May I? Can I? Well, not this one, because it's a diseased cat. It's ferocious. Ooh, it's a biter. I was about to take it in, give it some milk. You know, rehabilitate it. POOH: (MUFFLED) You're squishing me. What on earth? Did you hear my voice there? CECIL: Yeah. I do that funny voice, "You're squashing me... "with your demands to play gin rummy." (CHUCKLES) I was like a ventriloquist when I was younger. Very good. Very good. (LAUGHS) We've got all weekend. For? Gin rummy. We should probably try and play cards tomorrow then. I'd love that. Yes! Tomorrow? Well, yes, good evening! Good night! Have a nice... CECIL: See you tomorrow. CHRISTOPHER: Stop wriggling, he's gonna see you moving. Good evening. Stop it. Meow! You see? CECIL: Ha! Yeah. (POOH SLURPING) (MUSIC PLAYING OVER RECORD PLAYER) (POOH CHUCKLING) POOH: Mmm. Oh, it really is very good. Are you sure you wouldn't like some, Christopher Robin? (STAMMERS) Yes, yes, I'm sure. Pooh, how ever did you recognize me? After all these years. Well... You haven't changed a bit. But I've changed tremendously. Not right here. (SIGHS) It's still you looking out. I'm covered in honey now. Oh. Oh, yes, I see. (GRUNTING) CHRISTOPHER: Sticky mess. POOH: Your floor is very sticky. Pooh. Oh... Oh, this place is very big. Do you live here all alone? CHRISTOPHER: Just now, yes. But usually, no. My wife and daughter are in the countryside for the weekend. Well, why aren't you with them? Well... (POOH STRAINING) CHRISTOPHER: Oh. Sticky business. I had to stay for work. Why are you here and not in the forest with your friends? That's the question, Pooh. Well, I couldn't find anybody. And, I couldn't find anyone either. And I looked for them both. (MUSIC STOPS PLAYING) (MUFFLED) Hello? (SIGHS) POOH: Piglet? Eeyore? Tigger? Where is everybody? Exactly! Where is Tigger, or Kanga, or Roo? POOH: That's why I'm here. I'm sure I don't know where they are. I've scarcely thought about them in 30 years. (GRUNTS) Well, we think about you every day. Well, that's very kind. And I'm sorry, Pooh. But it's getting late, and I'm very busy. I haven't got time to help you look. I'm on a deadline. So, do you think you might just... (POOH SNORING) Oh, you silly old bear. (SNORING CONTINUES) (SOFTLY) Good night, Winnie the Pooh. (CRASHING) (GROANS) What on earth! Pooh! POOH: Oh, dear. (POOH GROANS) What luck. Pooh! Your ladder is broken. That's not a ladder. That was a shelf. That explains why it's no good for climbing. (SIGHS) I haven't got time to muck about. I should be working. Trying to find a solution. Even though I think it may be impossible. People say nothing is impossible. (CHUCKLES) But I do nothing every day. No, Pooh, that's not the... (SIGHS) Never mind. Look, I can't be distracted. Which is why you need to go home. But how? (CRASHING) Sussex. We go to Sussex. And we get you back in your own home. Now! (HORNS HONKING) It's very loud and not in a hummy sort of way. Well, welcome to London. (DOG BARKS) Well, hello there. Are you on an expotition, too? Oh, bother! Pooh! What did you do? POOH: Do you think he's all right? CHRISTOPHER: Come here. Come in here. Look. You can't just keep saying hello to people. People can't see you moving and talking. But why? Because, because... You're different. And people don't like things that are different. So I shouldn't be me. (STAMMERS) No! No, you should always be yourself. Oh, this is very confusing. It may be the hunger. You've just eaten! Oh, that's right. Maybe I didn't eat enough. Look, never mind about that. For now, just try and be a less exuberant you. Ex-Pooh-berant. Flop. Sag. Go limp. POOH: Flop. Sag. Yes! POOH: Go limp. I know, I've got it! How about, play "Naptime." I love play! Well, let's see it. Like this? Well done! Now, just keep absolutely still. That's it. Come on. POOH: Christopher! There's a rumbly in my tumbly. Let's stop for a snack. CHRISTOPHER: There's no time for snacks. POOH: What about a smackerel? Play "Naptime!" Balloons! Come and get them. May I have a travel balloon? You don't need a balloon. Well, I know I don't need one... but I would like one very, very much, please. Please. Please! VENDOR: We've got all your favorite colors! I'd like a balloon, please. What color? Red. Uh, red will be fine, yes. Thank you very much. POOH: Thank you ever so much. Balloons! (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON PA) (MAN BLOWS WHISTLE) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) ATTENDANT: Here is your ticket. Thank you very much. ATTENDANT: Good morning, sir. Good morning. POOH: Why is he in a cage? I'd like a return ticket, please? To Hartfield in Sussex. Thank you. ATTENDANT: Certainly, sir. CHRISTOPHER: Could you give me some space, please? ATTENDANT: Your ticket. (COINS CLATTERING) Here we are. And, uh, still two minutes to spare. So, good, yes? On the dot, sir. Good, thank you. (ATTENDANT CLEARS THROAT) The balloon went that way, sir. Thank you. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) Excuse me. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I'm terribly sorry. Sorry, sorry. There he is! Right. Excuse me. You're not a Woozle, are you? Oh, Christopher Robin! Thank goodness. Give me that! That's mine. Give it back. Well, he was mine first, you know? That is true. Oh, for heaven's sake! You can't just take a teddy bear from a grown man. POOH: Christopher, could you turn the world right side up again, please? Did that say honey? Can we go back? Ooh! CHRISTOPHER: Excuse me. POOH: (SIGHS) Much better. I thought you were playing "Naptime." It was one of my briefer naps. But, Christopher, my balloon. Well, it's gone now. You don't need it anymore anyway. But it did make me very happy. Did it not make you happy? Not really. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (CHRISTOPHER MUMBLING) Do you always have that case with you? What? A case? (STUTTERS) My briefcase? Yes, usually. Why? Is it more important than... a balloon? Yes, it's more important than a balloon. I see. More like... a blanket. Yes. More like a blanket. What does it do? What? It's for keeping very important things in. Pooh, do you think you might be able to amuse yourself for a while? I have got some rather pressing work to do. House. Clouds. House. Tree. Bush. A man. Dog. Pooh. What're you doing? Oh, I'm playing a game. It's called "Say What You See." Could you "Say What You See" a little more quietly? (SOFTLY) House. Grass. Trees. Pond. I don't know what that is. Pooh. Well, that's a man. Pooh. Little bit more quietly. Please? Oh, I'm sorry, this compartment is rather full. It's his naptime. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Hmm. (CHRISTOPHER MUMBLING) CHRISTOPHER: We'll save at least 322 pounds a month. Well, that's not nothing. Which brings us to 14%. Still not enough. Someone's gonna have to walk the plank. They'll never forgive me for this. Sorry, Gary. CONDUCTOR: Now arriving at Hartfield Station. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (BELL DINGING) Hartfield! Hartfield Station! Look. My balloon! Oh. Now come on, Pooh. We've got to hurry. POOH: Yes. We need to find our friends. CHRISTOPHER: No, Pooh. I meant, I have to get back for work. Oh. POOH: Are we going in? No, no, Pooh. We must keep very quiet. Not let them see us. Come on. Stay low. POOH: (WHISPERS) Oh. Who is that? Pooh! POOH: She can't be Pooh. I'm Pooh. CHRISTOPHER: (WHISPERS) No, that's Evelyn. My wife. POOH: Oh. She looks very kind. She is very kind. And who is that? That's Madeline. My daughter. POOH: Can she come and play with us? No, she can't come. Does she not like to play? No, no, it's just... Well, look, she's working. POOH: Oh, I see. Does she have a briefcase like you? No. Come on, Pooh. POOH: Do you think she'd like my red balloon? It might make her happy. What is it with you and the balloon? There's more to happiness than just balloons, Pooh. Look, Madeline is happy and I'm happy that she's happy. Well, let's go. (BIRDS CHIRPING) CHRISTOPHER: There, Pooh. I got you home. Aren't you coming with me? CHRISTOPHER: I can't. I've gotta go back to London. But I need your help. I've lost all of my friends. Perhaps they're back now... and you can tell them all about your adventures. I would like to do that. Off you go then. Goodbye, Christopher. Goodbye, Pooh. What're you doing, Pooh? Sometimes when I'm going somewhere and I wait... a somewhere comes to me. Right. Well... Good luck with everything. I should need good luck. For I am a bear of very little brain. Right. Well, goodbye. POOH: Goodbye. (SIGHS) Look out, Pooh. Here I come. (GRUNTING) Pooh? Pooh! Pooh! (GRUNTING) (WOOD CREAKING) Oh. (GRUNTS) So this is what this feels like. Are you stuck? Yes, it would appear that I am stuck. Happens to me all the time. Have you just eaten honey? No, Pooh, I have not just eaten honey. (GRUNTS) Oh, it's still here. Hundred Acre Wood. Well, I didn't expect to be here this morning. Was it always this gloomy? POOH: I don't believe so. I wonder where they all could be. Well, I was hoping you would know. Pooh, I haven't been here in years. How would I know? But you're Christopher Robin. Ah, right. Yes. Well, the thing is to do this systematically. Oh, follow the simple honey bee. No, Pooh. The key is to head in just one direction to avoid getting lost. Especially in all this fog. I always get to where I'm going... by walking away from where I have been. CHRISTOPHER: Do you? POOH: That's the way I do it. I'm hungry. CHRISTOPHER: Come on, Pooh. We'll never get anywhere at this rate. (WIND HOWLING) (POOH HUMMING) CHRISTOPHER: Is anything familiar? POOH: The fog. Well, besides the fog. POOH: (GASPS) Oh, bother. CHRISTOPHER: What's the matter? Oh, Pooh. You can't be serious. There's no such thing as Heffalumps and Woozles. Of course there are. Didn't you see the sign? Pooh, terrifying elephant and weasel-like beasts... who wander the world preying on happiness aren't real. Now, come on. Christopher? What do you do? I'm the Efficiency Manager at a luggage company. You must have many friends there. There's lots of people who rely on me. So, yes. No, I don't think of them as friends. That makes it harder if I have to let them go. Where will they go? I don't know, Pooh. (STAMMERS) I don't know. Did you let me go? I suppose I did. Come on, Pooh. Oh. What is that? It's a compass, from the war. I still keep it with me. May I see the compass? Yes, I suppose so. Oh. Shall we follow this very handy arrow?
