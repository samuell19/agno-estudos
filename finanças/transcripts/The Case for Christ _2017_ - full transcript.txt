I'm willing to take that chance. Okay. You're a journalist. Check it out. Where would you start? Unless you want to do two years of seminary, I'd say go straight for the jugular. The entire Christian faith hinges on the resurrection of Jesus. If it didn't happen, it's a house of cards. He's reduced to a misunderstood rabbi at best. At worst, he's a lunatic who was martyred. For a guy who thinks I'm trying to assassinate Christianity, you sure you want to hand me that gun? I'm pretty sure you're not gonna be able - to pull the trigger. - All right. Who's the big authority on the Resurrection? Dr. Gary Habermas. He debated Antony Flew. That guy's one of my heroes. He's in Wisconsin, by the way. Big debate this weekend. - Wisconsin? - Mm-hmm. Who would go to Wisconsin? ♪♪ REPORTER (OVER RADIO): ...spike in gang violence, especially in the communities of Wrigleyville, Lincoln Park, and Englewood, as evidenced... Dr. Habermas, if Christians want to hold on to their belief in a giant cosmic imaginary friend... - (LIGHT LAUGHTER) - ...that's all well and good, but don't try to stand your historical technique up against a tsunami of legitimate scholarship. - You will drown. - (LAUGHTER) HABERMAS: Well, thank you for the warning, Dr. Singer, but are you not aware that Gerd Ludemann, one of the most famous atheist New Testament scholars, now believes that the earliest known report of the Resurrection was formed no more than three years after the Cross? Now, these are your colleagues, sir, not mine. Something you'd like to ask me, Mr. Strobel? Yeah, well, I-I... so I read your book, and there's something that stuck out to me. How can anyone talk about historical evidence for the Resurrection when the Resurrection, by nature, is a miracle? Right? We all know miracles can't be proven scientifically. Correct, but we don't have to prove a miracle to prove a resurrection. (CHUCKLING): Okay. Love to hear you explain that one. No, you just have to show that Jesus died and he was seen afterwards. Right, but the very people who claim that they saw him are religious zealots. So, in my line of work, we call those "biased sources." Well, I'm not interested in bias either, Mr. Strobel. You see, I care about the facts for professional and-and personal reasons. Right, so where are the facts, Dr. Habermas? The Resurrection narrative is more legend than it is history. Really? Well, not according to historical records. Did you know that we have a report of the Resurrection with specific eyewitnesses that dates all the way back within months of the Resurrection itself? That source also adds that 500 separate people saw Jesus at the same time. We're not talking decades or centuries after the Cross, Mr. Strobel. It's months. Hey, you a coffee drinker? Uh, sure. ALISON: I should be able to reach the faucet. When am I gonna be taller? (CHUCKLING): Before you know it. - Ooh. - What's wrong, Mommy? Nothing's wrong. It's just the little one saying hello. LEE: Okay, so 500 witnesses, but that's still just one historical source: the Bible. Wrong. There are at least nine ancient sources both inside and outside the Bible confirming that disciples and others encountered Jesus after the Crucifixion. But-but they were already followers of Jesus. Well, not all of them. Think of Saul of Tarsus. He originally was a persecutor of Christians. He hunted them down and killed them. Yet he died the Apostle Paul, proclaiming that Jesus was the Son of God. But-but let's not kid ourselves here. People die for lies all the time. 900 people died drinking poison Kool-Aid at Jonestown. True, and there are other examples like that throughout history, but here's the difference. People don't willingly drink poison for something that they know is a lie. Fair point. If the early Church martyrs knew that the Resurrection was a hoax, then why would they willingly die for it? - Would you? - Um, I want to go back to something that you said earlier. You said that, uh... that this was personal to you. Why is that? I lost my wife Debbie to cancer. I'm sorry about that. It was the worst thing that will ever happen to me. (TAKES DEEP BREATH) But in my time of loss, it... it made me confront my beliefs. That is where I found my true comfort. Because I know that I am gonna see my wife again someday. And... forgive me, but as a man who... who claims to value hard evidence, don't you find that-that sort of, um, hopeful thinking weakens your argument? Not one bit. The fact that I benefit from gravity isn't proof that it's real, just as my dislike for mosquitoes isn't an argument against their existence. You see, what I... what I want and what I don't want has no impact on truth. That being said, if Christ's resurrection means that I get to be with Debbie again, I have no problem being happy about that.

I figured that maybe you'd want to give me, uh, your side of things-- you know, help yourself out a bit here. I didn't do nothing. Okay, so then... so then tell me how it all went down. I don't know. It's fuzzy. Joe started shoving me around for no reason. Who's Joe? - Koblinsky. - HICKS: The cop. Koblinsky. He put his hands on me, so I fought back, like anyone would. We go at it for a bit, then a gun goes off. - Whose gun? - I don't know. Like I told you, I was drinking that night. - It was fuzzy. - Crime scene report says they found your .22-caliber pistol in the bushes, that it was missing a bullet and it had your prints all over it. Koblinsky carries a .38. His gun was never fired. In fact, it was never taken out of its holster, so... if you didn't shoot him, then who did? My old lady kicked me out that night. I got a little crazy, you know, fired off a round at the building, but I didn't aim it at nobody or hurt nobody. I tossed my piece in the bushes when Koblinsky rode up on me. That's it-- he tossed it in the bushes. I tossed it in the bushes. Mr. Hicks, are you still affiliated with the Gangster Disciples? You know what this is? This is a waste of my time. Guard.

I, uh... I should tell you I'm a bit of a history buff myself, so... Oh. Yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm particularly intrigued with your archaeological work. Oh. A former life. Uh, former life, yes. I'm a... I'm a bit surprised, given your, uh... your stellar reputation that you just gave all that up for, uh, this. Well, would you like to be more specific? Well, it just seems to me that, for the better part of 2,000 years, Christianity has been creating these... these rituals and these rules. You know, they've erected these elaborate and often expensive cathedrals, and all of that to support a faith that I believe is-is ultimately built on sand. And yet it's all still standing. Yes, because people keep telling each other the same stories over and over again. Just because I write something down and I bury it in the dirt, that doesn't make it true. I think I'm beginning to see the crux of your visit. Look, I- I understand that a number of people claimed to have seen Jesus after his crucifixion and some of them even wrote it down, but I guess my question is: How-how can we be sure of the reliability of those manuscripts? Well, the same way we authenticate any historical document: by comparing and contrasting the copies that have been recovered. It's called textual criticism. The more copies we have, the better that we can cross-reference and figure out if what the original was saying is historically accurate. And the earlier they come from in history, the better. Take Homer's "Iliad," for example. MARQUEZ: Hmm? Is this real? It's as real as the Macedonian dirt that I dug it up from. LEE: Well, the Greeks considered this their Bible - for many centuries. - Yes, they did. That is one of 1,565 copies in existence today. Now, the "Iliad" was originally composed - 800 years before Christ. - Okay. This Greek copy is dated at the third century A.D. (LEE INHALES DEEPLY) So... (EXHALES) 800-- that's-that's... 1,100 years between this copy and the original, yes? Correct. There is only one ancient collection of writings that has more authenticated copies than the "Iliad." Can you guess what that is? You're gonna tell me the Bible. The New Testament. And how many copies is that? To date, archaeologists have recovered 5,843 Greek New Testament manuscripts. That's four times as many as the "Iliad." - Really? - The earliest fragment of the Gospel of John was found in ancient Egypt, and it dates to the second century A.D. How close is that to the original? Less than 30 years. I have one of the fragments in my collection. - It's quite a treasure, isn't it? - Hmm. After the New Testament and the "Iliad," runners-up don't even come close. We only have a hundred copies of Sophocles, seven copies of Plato's tetralogies and only five copies of anything by Aristotle. In fact, if you laid the surviving copies of Aristotle one on top of the other, it would make barely four feet. You do the same with surviving copies of the New Testament, the stack would be a mile high. Nothing else in history even comes close. How is that for "reliable"? LEE: Well, Father, I certainly appreciate it. You've given me a lot of food for thought. MARQUEZ (CHUCKLING): Entirely my pleasure. LEE: Oh, wow. The Shroud of Turin. That is a fantastic reproduction. Uh, the actual shroud is in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Italy. Under lock and key. Of course. No one's ever proven if the shroud is the actual burial cloth of the Christ, but whenever someone looks in those eyes for the first time, the Galilean who hung on the cross two millennia ago suddenly becomes a real person. But why would he do it? Why... why allow himself to be killed if-if he really is the... the Son of God? Why not use his power to defend himself? The answer to that is what got me out of the dirt and into the church. It's really very simple. Love. ♪♪ - Mm-hmm.

Oh, the judgment. Here it comes. - I'm not judging you. - Bring it on. I'm worried, hon, that you've been up late every night or out. I just... I feel like you're not here with me. Well, whose fault is that, Leslie? Okay. You've obviously had one too many. - You're being a jerk. - So this is my fault, then? - (SIGHS) - Sweetheart, I'm not the one who went and changed.

Rolling in at the crack of noon. Just trying to get to the bottom of this cop shooting, chief. Mm-hmm. By reading Voltaire. Can't wait to see how that's gonna play in. Well, that's for something different. How long till I'm reading copy? I'm trying, okay? There's a big story here. I feel it. Yeah, I need to feel it right here. I know that, and I'm gonna do my best to make that happen. - (PHONE RINGS) - All right? Oh, excuse me. Legal Affairs desk. - MAN: Lee Strobel? - Speaking. Yeah, this is, uh, Bill Craig. I'm sorry. Who? Bill Craig. Dr. Craig, thank you for returning my call. I appreciate that. BILL: Yeah, I'm sorry for the delay. I'm-I'm calling from Jerusalem. I have to give a lecture any minute. I just, uh... I didn't want to keep you waiting. LEE: I'll cut right to the chase. So, I've been doing research into the purported resurrection of Jesus, and I want to run a theory by you. Maybe the reason that the tomb was empty was because Jesus' body was never there in the first place. Because we know that the Romans used to throw the bodies of... of, uh, crucifixion subjects to the dogs. - Right? - Well, there's no evidence for that, but there are specific records that didn't happen to Jesus. - And what records are those? - Well, actually, the earliest recorded accounts tell us that Jesus was properly buried in a tomb-- and the Romans did allow for burial of some crucifixion victims. But then there's something that still doesn't add up to me about all of these supposed eyewitnesses that claimed to have found Jesus' empty tomb. What, the fact that they were all women? Yeah, because... because we know that, according to Jewish customs, women were deemed to be unreliable witnesses. - Am I right? - Well, true. So, why did all four gospel writers record that it was women who discovered the empty tomb? (LAUGHING): It... So I'm asking you that. Well, if you were a first-century Jew making up this story out of thin air, then you would never say that women discovered the tomb. - It would damage your case, not help it. - Okay. So maybe we're dealing with the world's most inept disciples. Or maybe the disciples reported what actually happened and let the chips fall where they may. Okay, all right, but you-you have to admit here that there is a... there is a gaping hole - in all of this. - A gaping hole? The-the fact that the gospels are filled with contradictions about the empty tomb. Okay? If I turned in a story that was this jumbled, I'd be out of a job. If we look through the gospels, you start at... start at Matthew, okay? Matthew puts Mary Magdalene and some other Mary at the tomb. You flip over to Mark, he adds Salome. You go to Luke, he adds Mary, mother of James, and then some lady named Joanna. What-what is that? You need a Sherpa guide to sort your way through this mess. Sure, there are differences, but that doesn't trouble most historians. Why? Why doesn't that trouble...? It troubles me. It should trouble them. Because the core of the story is the same in all four. After Jesus is placed in the tomb, it's visited on Sunday morning by a small group of women, and they find the body is gone. Now, you've studied law. Yeah, law, yes. Then you know that, when policemen question several witnesses at a crime scene, they never expect the secondary details to be consistent, as long as the core account is the same. In fact, if they're too similar, it's suspect. - That's true. - Well, that's exactly what we're talking about here. The empty tomb is based on evidence, and isn't evidence your trade? It is, yes, but what if... what if the Resurrection is one of the historical details that was recorded incorrectly? How can we know? How can we ever know? (SIGHS) Lee... let me ask you something. Do you really want to know the truth, or is your mind already made up, - regardless of the facts? - Oh, look, Doc, I-I'm a journalist, okay? It's my job to challenge assumptions until they're proven otherwise. That's all I'm doing. Well, I get that. But when is enough evidence, enough evidence? LESLIE: He's so frustrating. I'm just not good at this, I guess. I just... I want to share it with him. I want to celebrate it, and I'm walking on eggshells in my own home. Well, it's probably the same for him. He's walking on eggshells, too, so... give yourself a break. But the more I try to reach him, - the more he pulls away. - Okay, so... how did you reach him before? Well, we'd talk. We'd really talk and listen and... "Listen." (LAUGHS) Do that. - LESLIE: Easier said than done. - (ALFIE LAUGHS) (MUTTERING) Koblinsky... Koblinsky. Koblinsky. Koblinsky. Koblinsky. You gotta be kidding me. Says here that Koblinsky was Hicks's arresting officer six times. Obviously, these guys knew each other. In fact, when I interviewed Hicks, he slipped up. He called Koblinsky by his first name. So, what's your theory? My theory is that Hicks is an informant for the gang task force and Koblinsky is his handler. Which means a gang member just shot his own handler and, for some reason, Chicago PD's covering it up. PD's protecting this guy. He's a cop shooter. (SIGHS) I can't run that unless you get me a source inside the PD-- someone to confirm Hicks is an informant. Well, I'm gonna need a little help. (SIGHS) DUBOIS: Dinner and drinks only. Well, drinks at least. Bring me back a receipt. And don't close the... MAN: What do you want from me, Strobel? It's an open-and-shut case. That's all I know. (CHUCKLES) So, you're... you're on the gang squad. That's all you know? You gotta give me something. Can... can I get you dinner? You like steak? LEE (CLEARS THROAT): Here's my theory. Koblinsky's on your team, and Hicks is your informant. (CHUCKLES) You think that, uh, 'cause you take down a big car company that there's a conspiracy underneath every rock? No, don't-don't... Come on, Acosta, you know that I'm right. Koblinsky's a hero, okay? No one's taking that away from him. But his own snitch shoots him, and your bosses don't want it getting out. That doesn't look good for your new department, politics or whatever, I get it. You want to know what I hear? I hear they're gonna knock Hicks's time down to petty time in county. They're gonna put him back on the streets. They're offering Hicks a plea to keep his mouth shut. Now, you don't want that. Now, all I need to run this story is one source from the squad. That way, everybody knows Hicks is a stoolie, he goes away for a long time, and, boom, your task force is free of cop shooters. I'm not gonna quote you. I'm not gonna use your name. You don't have to go on the record. Nothing. How about this? If I'm even in the right ballpark, you leave the tip. Drop a couple bucks on the table, get up, you walk out of here, I know that I'm safe to run my story. I'll do you one better. I'll pay for the meal. It was crap anyways.

I've been there. But I can promise you this. In His time and in His way, God always keeps His promises. And what did He promise Ezekiel? "I will give you a new heart. "I will put a new spirit in you. "I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh." Now, that's a truth you already know. Yeah. But it's the same truth for Lee. You just gotta be patient. Okay.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER) Hey, just because they said they saw Jesus doesn't mean they actually did. - I'm sorry.

Maybe it was, like, mind control or brainwashing. Rod! You need to see a psychologist. Oh, you think I got a screw loose? Yeah, well, that's another story.

I need you to find me... - Sorry. ...a good psychologist to interview. - A ps-psy... - Psychologist. That's right. A guy with... with a lot of academic street cred.

LEE: Ah, agnostic. Finally. ROD: ...and a leading authority on human behavior at Purdue University. LEE: Indiana. Great. Dr. Waters. Ah. Hello, Mr. Strobel. As much as I would like to help a fellow skeptic, what you're proposing is completely impossible. But how can you say that? I mean, if Charles Manson can turn his followers into... murderous zombies, surely, the followers of the Christ cult could be convinced of their own delusions. Listen, hallucinations are like dreams. They happen in individual minds. They don't spread like the common cold. Okay, so... a hypnotist turns a stage full of insurance salesmen into... into clucking chickens-- then that's... that's not really happening or...? No, of course it is. The power of suggestion can be very profound. But it's one thing to be mesmerized into making animal noises. It's quite another for 500 people to have the same dream. To be honest, that would be an even bigger miracle than the Resurrection itself. And without an empty tomb, you and I, we're not even having this conversation. If Jesus recovered from his injuries, that solves that problem. All these people could have easily seen him, yes? Yes, but I'm afraid that's not a brain issue. You need to speak to a medical doctor. Of course. Dr. Waters, again, thank you for your time. You've been most gracious. Before you go, may I ask you something? Sure. It's about your father. I'm just curious what your relationship With him is like. (CHUCKLES) Um... Complicated. Let me guess. Distant, cold, doesn't give much affirmation or express love? Guilty on all charges. Why? I imagine, as a skeptic, you're familiar with history's great names in atheism. Hume, Nietzsche, Sartre, Freud. Of course, yes. Some of my greatest heroes. Did you know that all of them had a father who either died when they were young, abandoned them, was physically or emotionally abusive? In the world of therapy, it's called a father wound. No, I... I was not aware of that. But with all due respect, Dr. Waters, I did not have a loving father, but that doesn't mean that I have a problem with those who do. What I have a problem with is some made-up loving father. If God was real... ...I could accept that He loves me. I just don't believe He is. I don't disagree. Well, unfortunately, my wife does. The problems that it's currently causing my marriage are very real. Again... thank you. LESLIE: "I will give you a new heart "and put a new spirit in you.

I, uh... I-I appreciate your time. (CLEARS THROAT) So, my line of attack is this: The reason the eyewitnesses were able to see Jesus after Golgotha is because he never died on the cross. Because, if he doesn't die, there's no resurrection. - Yes? - That's right. So... so, whether or not Jesus himself or, uh... or someone else took him off of the cross early or if he fakes his own death, it doesn't matter. It completely discounts every aspect of the Resurrection. Right. The swoon theory. Yeah, well, he passed out. He didn't die. I'm afraid there's a long line of skeptics in front of you with that hypothesis. Including only a billion Muslims the world over who also don't believe that Jesus died on the cross because the Koran says so. With all due respect to Islam, the Koran was written six centuries after Christ. I prefer my historical sources - a bit closer to actual events, yeah? - I understand. But-but you concede that it's possible. (METHERELL CHUCKLES) Mr. Strobel, I am a medical doctor and a scientist. I have seen a great many strange phenomenon - in my lifetime. - Mm-hmm. But the swoon theory is rubbish. (CHUCKLES) "Rubbish." That's a... is that a... a medical opinion? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. It is, actually. Um... swoon theorists tend to skim over the fact that Jesus was flogged prior to his crucifixion. Do you know what happens in a Roman flogging? Um, yeah, the person is lashed with a whip. No, not lashed. Scourged and pummeled savagely. You see, the... the cowhide whip is braided with metal balls and bone fragments. The flesh on Jesus' back would've been shredded. The very muscles and sinews themselves laid open to exposure. The flogging itself would have left Jesus in critical condition from massive blood loss. Which is why he collapsed under the weight of the cross that the Romans made him carry through town. Mm-hmm. Okay, so is it possible that Jesus survives being spiked to the cross? Well, yes, you could survive it, but it's child's play compared to what comes next in a crucifixion. Slow, agonizing death by asphyxiation. Come with me. The stress on Jesus' chest muscles would have locked his lungs into the inhale position. Right, so in order to let the breath out, he would have had to shove himself up using his spiked wrists and feet, scraping his shredded back against the wood of the cross. And then sagged back down again in order to draw his next breath, which he would have had to have done over and over and over again until utter exhaustion just made it impossible. And then, inevitably... He dies. Uh, in... in theory. But let's-let's remember, these soldiers, they're not doctors, okay? So maybe, uh... maybe they took him off the cross and they... they thought he was dead but, in fact, he wasn't. No, of course they weren't medical doctors. They were professional killers. Right, and they were quite good at their jobs. They had to be. If a prisoner escaped alive, they themselves would be executed. (SIGHS) Mr. Strobel, the crucifixion of Jesus is one of the best-attested events in the ancient world. And, if you will, the final nail in the coffin in the swoon theory is this: When the soldiers thrust their spear between Jesus' ribs, do you know what came out? Blood and water. Which we now know is a description of pericardial effusion as a result of death by asphyxiation. This is not a condition anyone could fake. And so, to answer your question, yes, it is my medical opinion that Jesus Christ died on that cross. WOMAN: Excuse me, Doctor? - I just need your signature. - One moment. Yeah, but-but-but... I got a... I-I have a real problem with most of the experts that I've talked to here. - Which is? - (SIGHS) Which is that most of them are not impartial. And if I'm gonna take a guess, I would say that you are not, either. And you would be correct, sir. Though I have learned that most impartial travelers who undertake this journey rarely remain so. However, I can refer you to one of the most impartial sources that I know. Would you trust the Journal of the American Medical Association? (CHUCKLES) Of course. It is a stellar scientific journal. Even I will admit that. - "On the Physical Death of Jesus." - Mm-hmm. "Clearly, the weight of the medical and historical evidence "indicates that Jesus was dead before the wound "to his side was inflicted. "Accordingly, interpretations based on the assumption "that Jesus did not die on the cross "appear to be at odds with modern medical knowledge." Doc, I gotta tell you, you're, uh... you're not telling me what I hoped to hear today. (PAGER BEEPING) (PHONE RINGING) Lee? Hey, it's me. Everything all right? Kids okay?

It is believed that the prison guards did little to protect Hicks, a fate not uncommon for cop shooters. Hicks was immediately taken to Mercy Hospital, where he's in serious condition. Elsewhere in Chicago, the wind is expected to kick up this evening over the lake and continue...

I've gone through every argument. I've followed every lead. At some point, young man, you're going to have to plant your flag on a mountain of uncertainty, where not every question is answered. The human mind will never get to the bottom of every mystery in the cosmos. Believing in God, not believing in God-- either way, still takes a leap of faith. So you're saying, even in our disbelief, that we still take a leap of faith. More or less. Me, well, I've come to my own conclusion. You're gonna have to do the same thing for yourself. What are you doing here? I thought you were banished. (CHUCKLES) Hey. What's the matter? You people and your God. You just... you know, you talk in circles. You offer... you offer just enough evidence but never enough to be conclusive. Then you fill in all the gaps with, "Oh, well, yeah, you just gotta have faith." It's a bunch of nonsense. You're really irritating, you know that? (LEE GROANS) Don't start with me, Kenny. You don't waste a lick of time bragging to all of us how great a reporter you are. So, why can't you put up or shut up on this story? What are you even talking about? Here's where the chili meets the cheese, my friend. One of my heroes was C.S. Lewis, a man who began as a skeptic, much like yourself. At the end of his journey, you know what he said? He said, if Christianity is false, it's of zero importance. But if it's true, there's nothing more important in the entire universe. So, you want your wife back? Well, hey, guess what, people in hell want ice water. Not everybody gets everything they want.

Good night. ♪♪ LESLIE: Father, please... please soften Lee's heart. Put a new spirit in him. Remove from him his heart of stone, and give him a heart of flesh. ♪♪ LEE: The only way to truth is through facts. KENNY: The entire Christian faith hinges on the resurrection of Jesus. If it didn't happen, it's a house of cards. HABERMAS: No, you just have to show that Jesus died and he was seen afterwards. LEE: How can we be sure of the reliability of those manuscripts? MARQUEZ: Archaeologists have recovered 5,843 Greek New Testament manuscripts. Nothing else in history even comes close. METHERELL: Would you trust the Journal - of the American Medical Association? - LEE: Yes. METHERELL: Jesus Christ died on that cross. LEE: You're not telling me what I hoped to hear today. LESLIE: What if it is true? Wouldn't you want to know that? CRAIG: The first recorded account tells us that he was buried in a tomb. The empty tomb is based on evidence. Isn't evidence your trade? LESLIE: Faith is the evidence of things we can't actually see. CRAIG: Any careful historian will see that the core account is consistent even if a... a few of the secondary details are told from different perspectives. HABERMAS: 500 separate people saw Jesus at the same time. WATERS: That would be an even bigger miracle than the Resurrection itself. CRAIG: The disciples reported what actually happened. LEE: People with zero motivation to lie. CRAIG: Do you really want to know the truth? When is enough evidence, enough evidence?
