Ah, Venice Beach... A city built in contrast. Old concrete buildings with decades among million dollar homes. The vagabonds from the beach spread out, the streets with their Oklahoma cousins... that come every summer. All the scenes about diving are, to be pressed, by some technology company. And sometime, next to an uproar, will find this type... The only detective on leave in Venice. You just have to live life. It passes so quickly, like a whisper. It's my boss, Steve Ford. A renowned self-appointed figure in the community. It takes your work very seriously. Before you know it... They are 12 years old and, where are they? I do not want them to commit, the same mistakes as I do. They begin like this, a little grass, and then, a little hard, okay? Then a few bottles of tequila every week. And prostitutes three times a week. And, yes, it's fun, it's fun at the moment. But let me tell you something... These moments always end, with your heads looking huge... as if a bus had passed over them. Are you happy about that? No, you're not happy about that. Then, after a short time, are sitting on the kitchen floor... half naked, with a gun in his mouth... and all that they think is, will it be today? Is today the day I pull the trigger? But you have the right to live... And you have to live it well... Did you notice? It's ok. Let's go. Here is a skate park, go there. Let's go skating. I always wanted to be a private detective... And since Steve was the only choice in town, I had no choice... other than working with him. Which is good... I think. And as he was busy today, to give some lessons to local youth, I finally had the opportunity in my first case... And that brought me here! Even Nola Tuiasosopo... I think I'm saying well, I'm not sure, I think she's from Samoa. Not that there is any harm, but some of them have difficult names, some of them. Well, I'll edit this later. Missing since July. I just saw her at the corner of Six and Oakwood. And, let me tell you, Steve was not exaggerating, Nola is very attractive. She bluffs that, she's a very nice woman. Why not an attractive professional model? In any case, it seems, she is joining together with a group. Maybe, Alcoholics Anonymous, just... Shit! Oh... And my name is John. I'm Steve's partner. Well, I'm going to be a partner soon, just wait for some paperwork. Do not lose sight of it. Who wants to start first? Hello, my name is Rick and... I'm addicted to sex. Hi, Rick. Hello Porn is my poison. It started when I was walking, in catholic school and progressively worsened. I currently spend about 40 hours a week. This is a full-time job. I have premium signatures on the four largest... PornHub, RedTube, Reality Kings and Brazzers. Not to mention, EskimoTube... JizzHut... Auu... Oh, God, I'm a monster! Jesus! Right? Want to share with the group? It's ok. Want to share this with the group? The group? Ahaa... No! No, I'm fine. I'm better at listening. But, not quite, it works. Everyone needs to participate on the first night. Please... Well, if need be. Aha... It's ok. So go... I'm John... And I'm addicted to sex. Hello John. Hello. Yes, I love sex. I love receiving, and I love giving. I love it too much and I have too much. That's my main problem. On that sex road, I leave my thumb stretched out, waiting to get in one of the sex cars. I also spend about 40 hours a week... but with sex. It's not the creep like this guy, right? Sex for hours! And, actually, now that I think about it... are more than 40 hours. So I am doing time and a half. Yes, I should be overtime. I mean, obviously I do not go, having sex for money. This is bad, right? Do they all agree? Good. I really have sex with... Anyone who appears to me ahead. There are some limits, of course, the age... From 18 down not... "Not good," okay. Up, that's where I really shine... With 50, 60, 80, 90, more than 100 years... It's ok! Thank you for sharing, John. Nola? Hey, Nola? Are you following me? No, no. I'm not following you. No, do not play me "cat"! I'm not chasing you. I... I'm technically following you, but not in a chasing way... It is professionally... Strictly professional. Look... your brothers hired my boss to find you... and, that's how I appeared. They want you to come home, they miss you. I can take you, at least to my boss's house. In a professional way, not as a maniac or a pervert, or any of the parties. Yeah, I'll let you know. Well, then you'll be fine, see you tomorrow... Then in the morning we can find out, the best way to deal, with your brothers. Well, what about that guy, Ricky? 40 hours a week? I mean, that's a pretty serious commitment to masturbation. Yes, I hope he changes his hand once in a while. Yes. I mean, if not, it's a carpal tunnel syndrome... I know. The pains, and the dormancy. Yes. I just hope he has... Yes... help of a small tube. Sort of... Type with neon. Well, I'm just talking. Excuse. All right, it's here. Good. Yes. As you can see, you will be very well established. And, he comes home anytime. Send her. There he is. Steve is a great person. Okay, it was good, nice to meet you. - To you too. - Yes. Thanks for the ride. No problem, I just do my job. Bye. See you later. She looks good. Steve's a cool guy. She looks good. LA Detective Opens Private Investigation Firm Stay down! You'll wish you'd never touched him! Stop it! You're going to kill him!

Oh, man, come on, Tino! It was stolen and I asked for your help. Sorry, all right? I have feelings and I am sensitive. I know you're sensitive. I understand!

Cover this thing, I have pizza here! All right, yes. Fuck you! "Orale." Shoot, fuck! I'm not going there. This is Spyder's house. My car is in his garage, Steve. You have to go get him for me.

All right, take it easy. Give me the keys. Thank you, Steve. Good. Very well! Hi. Two large pizzas with pepperoni. They ordered, right? Hey, Spyder, here's a guy from the pizzas. Carlos Manuel Ochoa... Known as Spyder, with "and". With connections to the Sinaloa Cartel. Rumor has it he killed a barista at Starbucks for spelling his name badly. It becomes complicated because it is "y". But that's not the point. If there is a drug on sale in Venice, it comes from Spyder. Two pizzas with pepperoni. Did not they order this? No one ordered pizza, man. 2004, the pizzas are here, right? Are not you old enough to come over to deliver pizza? I tell you, man, my old lady tells me this shit all the time. How much? 25 dollars. Thank you, man. Thank you, that's enough. Hey, man, can I go to the bathroom? I've been in the car a long time. One or two? A. All right, bro. And where? To the left. Do not piss in the seat, eh? It's ok. Who the fuck are you? Are you a cop? Do not. Who are you? Steve. Oh yes? I'm friends with Spyder. Yes? The bathroom is here, right? Hey, Spyder... I think somebody's stealing your car. Son of a bitch. You killed my car! Oh, you can not kill a car like that, man. Look at him. A little hammering, a little sparkle! The tires still look fantastic. Excuse. Fuck you! Dave Jones, and no, is not the lead singer of "The Monkees". This guy is a local legend and Steve's best friend ever. His fame was given by surfing naked on the dock for 12 hours in a row... In acid. Nowadays he lost a lot of that pica... mainly due to a rather unpleasant divorce. Hello, Dave. Did you start working at Pino's Tino? You want my opinion on all this? Yes. Never buy a surf shop. Look at the inventory. She wants everything I have and a boarding house, too. I'm sorry, man. You'll be fine. Let's get around. The sun is rising soon. Yes so. I'll probably go to sleep. I finished your new board. This was fun, but I have to get my dog. Why do not you let Buddy stay with her? She likes me to come and get him. It makes you feel better... more security, I think. She? Steve's sister fell on hard times after her husband... have emptied the bank account. He was really there for her. Steve... Helped as much as he could. Hi, Katey. Thanks for the coffee. In fact, he's quite generous of him. See? What type. Taylor! Uncle Steve's here to take Buddy. Did you hear about him? He's still somewhere in Australia to meet up. We can not continue here. He thinks there's something else out there. I mean, what the hell's out there? Honey, I do not know. You'll be fine. Buddy Ford, 49 years in canine years... and 100% Parson Russell Terrier. Dude, Steve loves that dog. Uncle Steve. Hi, Taylor. What are you studing? Chemistry. You want some help with that? Advanced chemistry. Bring Buddy back sooner at night? How about I bring it every night and I always come and pick you up in the early morning... Until you tell me to stop? Seriously? Yes. That would be cool. He gets some gas. I do not care. Come on, Buddy, come on. Come on, come on, that's right. Sorry, dogs do not. Oh, no, he looks good. What does that mean? It's something I say when I try to circumvent the rules. Sometimes it works out. No? It's ok. Come out, my friend. A great cafe. You're not in your office. Hail, the Jew. Hold on. I know what it looks like. It is not an offense, everyone treats it like that. I mean, he calls himself "Lean the Jew." No, I'm not in my office. I went to your office. And you did not find me there? Steve, I want to hire you. He is an experienced businessman and a little miserable... not in a Jewish way, in a normal way. Hey, Steve, it's a lot of money just for a few photos, you know that? Yes. It could cost you a lot more money. Why are we arguing? Let's talk business. Thank you. I'll see you later, Lieutenant. Let's go, Buddy. A graffiter punk son of a bitch... painted the walls of my apartment building. I certainly could help you with that. I know many of them here... in the neighborhood, the only problem is that you still owe me money. Steve, I can not afford it. You understand, it is the principle of the thing. Steve! We're with the band back, bro! Great! My man! Taylor Swift has saved the music industry! What the hell was that? I have no idea. I'm going to sell you the house back. My parents' house? Yes. Are you going to sell it to me again? For the same price they sold you? Come on, Stevie, you'll get the hell out of me, man. I mean, this is now Silicon Beach. Do you know how much I can get for that house? No agreement. Another 10 percent. You can see that this really matters to you, Lieutenant. Why do you think that? I want it in writing. You kill me. All right, come on. I have to show you that. Saint Christ! You see what I mean? I like. You can see why I do not. He really captured your essence. Why do not you think about it? I painted four times. You should have seen the other shit, it was more disgusting than this. It's hard to imagine something more disgusting. Just act, Steve... if you want your parents' house back. See if you can pay me. Do not look at that, come on, do not look at that. In Divorce Everything Has To GO! This is it? Cash only, not checks. And this is for sale. Great thank you. She can keep my shop, but I will not leave her anything. Yes. I'm leaving. Do it, friend, let it all go. Normally by this time, Steve had already drunk about 8 cups of coffee... And it does not really handle caffeine very well. Well, here a little secret between us, I changed the coffee from our office... by decaffeination. You know, to calm down. John, did you see a photograph here? One with my house? This coffee is good. The Samoans called for you. I said you're so sorry. Good. You did not give the address for the office, right? Do not. Good. Although I am sure, that if they... make a small search... they can find out where it is. And the photograph? It's a picture of my family's house! No. Look, the insurer said it did not pay... until you have some things sorted out. A photograph of my parents' house. Yes, I did not see her. I was at my desk. Okay, there's no house yet. The insurance company said we will not be paid... until we, you know, file it. Now we have a new case. Great. Hail, the Jew, all the apartments in his building are being graffitted. There was a month of my life down the drain. The house... was on my desk, I was... I'm sorry, it's really here. Oh, well, let's see what happens to this picture. This is me as a child. See, seven years old. I'm holding the dog. Is that you? Yes. You were a fat fuck. You know, my parents fed me wrong food, but... Yeah, a lot of that, too. It looks like you might have had a third brother you ate. I'm surprised you did not eat the dog. Just because you were too big. But now you're fine, so... Do you know any graffiti artists around here? No, not in person... So you'll find one, and how about this? Yes, definitely, I'll definitely find some graffiters. You can also bring me more of this coffee. Yes definitely. Steve... I need you. I lost a lot of this weight all of a sudden. Come on, Buddy. You also lost a lot of that hair all of a sudden. Steve. Hello. I need your help. All right, when? Right now. Right now? Right now. You know why. I'm desperate. It's ok. Come on, Buddy, back. Right now, huh? Yes. Stay down, Buddy. Put it in your ear, you can hear me all the time. It's ok. Are you sure you want to go through this? I have to, Steve. At the first sign of trouble, you get out of there. I know. I leave. I'm not kidding. Wish me luck. I can? Hello, Dave. Anne. You have to sign the divorce papers, Dave. Do not sign anything. I repeat, do not say anything, Dave. Dave! I'll give you the surf shop, you can have her. Do not. Get up and leave. Are not you going to reconsider? It's done. Dave, it's done! Be careful, my friend. I'm going to sign these documents because I've learned how to quit. Oh no... And if you think you deserve everything I've worked for... so I want you to have them, including the surf shop. No, no, Dave. Do not sign anything, for, for! I warned him. I think I fucked up. You'll be fine. Come on, Buddy. You're going to spend some time with Taylor. It is not forever. Come on. Beautiful boy. Knock on the door. Such as? I am fine. And you, how are you? You know I see you as a son. I did not know that, but thank you. I think sometimes I see you as a father... in a certain way. A very intimidating father. I need your help, John. It's ok. What kind? Walking on the ground? You go there and find out who is painting the walls of the L?u, the Jew. I have analyzed all the paintings of the city. I did not find anything. The guy does not leave a signature. Maybe he's not one of these, maybe he's a trained artist. All right, yes. Of course, that fits. And, John... Wear some extra underwear. Because? Because? Why do I have to wear extra underwear? It's discipline. Excuse... It's part of being a detective... to wear multiple pairs of underwear? Do you have several pairs of underwear at the moment? That's my secret. Fix it. Get ready. Classic figure of a father. Christ, Nola. No, this has got to stop, okay? You really have to stop. Ended up. I can not see you again. I just needed to see you. Steve, do not answer that. It's Taylor. Who's Taylor? Waiting. Hello, my dear, how are you? Uncle Steve... I want you now! Who is she? It's just the maid, she slipped and fell. They robbed us, they took everything! What was it? They took everything, the TV, the stereo, the Xbox from Taylor. I can not believe they took Buddy! Try to calm down and wait for the police. Where are you going? I'll get my dog! Our dog! Our dog! Do not leave! Rajeesh... I did not see anything. You did not see what? Anything. What the hell are you talking about? Do not. I do not care what it is. I do not want to have any more problems, Steve. Well, I can... No! Your security camera is facing my street. They hate me in this neighborhood. Who hates you? You have been worshiped. Not all of them, okay? I am the one from the outside. They stole my dog, Buddy! It's a delicacy in my country, is not it? I never said that. You thought! 200! 200 dollars? That's how much it costs to betray the neighborhood. When this came. What if it's 80? It could be... Failed. Two guys, drugged, tried to change your stuff for beer. They had your dog. I saw them go for the walk outside. You're a good neighbor. Fuck you, Steve. Hey fucking guy, can I hit there? What did you call us? In fact, what he meant was fucking guys. Fucking face 1, fucking face 2. Hey, fuck you, man! How about this? Hey, what's your problem, bro! You are my problem. You broke my nose, man! Oh, he's silent. Who cares? Where's my fucking dog? He ran-away. Yes, he ran away. He ran-away. What do you mean, "he ran away"? We gave it to our "dealer", our "dealer" is who has it. What's his name? I do not know the name of the dog! Not the name of the dog, idiot! What is the name of your dealer? Spyder. His name is Spyder! Buddy's collar? Never mess with a man's dog. A fucked up job. So folks. Spyder? Hey, Spyder, it's me, Steve, remember? I felt really bad about hitting the car on the garage door. I bring you this delicious muffin basket. You got big balls like the fuckin 'pop in here again, bro. What time is it? Fucking time again, man. He fucked everything to get away. Hey, what's this? Banana nut It has a hint of cinnamon. So you're here why, "crazy"? There's a girl... My niece, Taylor, just turned 15. She's a gentle girl. She's good at school, she's smart, she's happy, she's funny... Out of nowhere, her father grabs and walks away. Just to try to find yourself, whatever that means. So now... I take care of Taylor and her mother, Katey. What does that have to do with anything? Let him finish. To be continued. Last night, the house was stolen. They took this TV, this set and that Xbox. But the most important thing they took was my dog. Buddy. This dog? This dog is mine. I did not steal this dog, okay? This dog is ours. This dog is mine. Shut up. Man, we did not steal any dogs. It was a gift. Even so, this dog is the only thing where my niece... you get some comfort. So you want the dog back? I'm not giving the dog back! She's in silence. She's silent. It's the only thing I want. Okay, then, "that"... You can keep the dog back. No! Yes. Only it's going to cost you 3 grand. 3 thousand? 4 thousand. You just said, 3 grand. You fucked my window. You offered me the dog. "Shut up." You give four of the big ones by the car, the window and the garage... And you can take the dog, because the story of the little girl... touched my heart, bro. I do not have all that money. Then I'll fucking kill you. So I can get it. You have 24 hours, "homes." This dog is mine, Spyder. Oh, Yuri, the local Venice shark and a ruthless son of a bitch. Everyone knows, he is the last person to borrow money. He is also the last person to be seen on a beach in a bikini. I love this country. It only takes a day to get back. What person borrows money from a guy who only takes a day to get back? How's it going, Yuri? It takes patience. So how much money do you need? 5 thousand On the phone, you said 4 grand. I thought, since I'm going to ask for 4, why not 5. Right? So, how do you think you're going to pay the money back? Yuri, it's me, Steve. You know I'm good at it. Wait, wait, wait. A Casio! I need this, I'm horrible with the hours. Listen, have you heard of the Belarusian tie? First, the testicles are cut... then push themselves down the throat. Then an incision is made from here to here. They pull the balls out and it looks like... A tight tie? Yes Yes Yes. Very formal. Look, Stevie, I like you, you're funny. I'll lend you the money. but either you pay me back, or you'll get a scrotum tie. "Ponimayu"? "Gives". Scrotum tie! Good luck. Thank you. I see you soon. I just got off the phone with my brokers and there's a Chinese group... who is interested in buying my apartment complex. I'm starting to get suspicious... on the graffiti situation. Yes, the situation of the graffiti is becoming doubtful. They're down to half the offer, Steve. So here's the thing, okay? You find that graffitis kid in the next two days... and assure me that there is no more graffitis until the end of the business... and I'm going to sell you this house for what I paid for it. That's very generous, Lieutenant. Yeah. Look, the way I see it, you're probably seeing an eight-figure loss... if I can not find this guy. But if you do not want my help, I understand. I'm sure you... All right, all right, yes. I see, all right. Find the guy and I'll fuck you up! See? Give, receive and everyone is happy. I'm not happy. This is not happiness. Catch those cones. Steve? Hi, it's John, sorry to leave this on the answering machine, but I'm looking at a photo of one of the fa?ades of the Leuven building... and... it's okay, yes... I give this piece a total of 7 out of 10. The shadow of the scrotum, the veins... it's as if this all follows the look. So this is what I'm going to do. I go to all the local art galleries... I show them the image, to try to absorb as much information as I can. AND... eyepiece, through my eyes, not with some lens. Okay... I'll see it better now and I'll see you later. Oh, Jesus, man. This was bad. Hello... I wonder if you can tell me something about an artist. Of course. It's ok. I have to warn you, it's a bit... Wait to see. Ah yes! Salvatore Lopez, is the artist. Salvatore Lopez, are you sure? Absolute. You sure about that? Yes. See, see how the veins follow him? Yes I see. It's him. And... the shadow of the scrotum, it's... I mean, it's a Salvatore classic. Perfect. Salvatore Classic? Certainly, yes. Salvatore Classic... Where can I find it? Because? Because I'm a big fan... and really want to order a facade. All right, give me your number, I'll see what I can do. Hey, Spyder, I got four of the big ones. Four of the big ones. Where's my dog? Bad news, cones. Your dog is gone. It's gone? Was it how? Everything was gone. Lupe, that bitch, took him. What are you talking about? You already have my money! This is by the car, the window and the garage. I was going to give you the dog for free. You think I'm some idiot? Give me my dog or I'll get by! The dog just left! That's it? Hey, bro? Bro. Do not think I only have people with good life in my house! You're really past. They went through what you never did! I can see that, you know. A great mental illness! Hey, this TV's from Taylor, bro. What about Taylor? What about Taylor? This TV belongs to your niece, bro. Take a deep breath, bro. Listen, that Lupe bitch took your dog, huh? And a folder of mine full of cocaine. You find her, you get my shit back, and I'll give you the money back. How about this? How about I find your girl... your binder full of cocaine... and you pay me the money to triple. Combined, cones. You better go now before my drug finds a new distributor. I'll take care of it. Listen... Wherever this bitch is, your dog is also. What's it? She likes Knott's Berry Farms, "homes." Knott's Berry Farm was closed long ago, was not it? No, it's still open. The other bitch in this photo is her sister, Consuela... She sometimes stays at my cousin's bar, La Patronca. Do you have the address for this? Fuck, go to google, "homes"! I need you to do some research for me, okay, buddy? The bar is La Patronca, we are looking for a girl named Consuela. We find out where she usually hangs, and this will get us to Lupe and coca. And, John, try not to notice, okay? Hector! Damn it! What did I tell you? You're no DJ, fuck you! Hello there, my friend. Ah, beautiful place here. Very enjoyable. For starters, I want one of the best "beers", please. I think $ 2 should arrive. I do not want "gringo" prices. Oh my... Beautiful boots. Oh, thank you, thank you. Oh, you can keep the change. Me too... I was hoping to know something about this girl here. Christ. Why do you ask? Are you the police? No, no, I'm not a cop. No, no, I'm just a friend, I'm just looking for her. She messed with you too? No, not that I know of. It's nothing personal, I just want to talk to her. It's ok... I needed to check. Her name is Consuela. She lives at the Hollywood Premiere Motel with her sister, Lupe. Good, this was a lot easier than I thought it would be. Thank you, thank you. Oh, he actually spat to the ground. Do you know that more... That's rightfully everything I needed to know, so... All right, I'll let you have it and thank you very much for your time. You can even have the beer, it's for you, my tip. Thank you. Beware! She plays mental games. It's ok. Only responds to messages within hours. One of the most annoying things is that it combines something... and then cancels on the same day. She will invite you to see a movie and then just want to see the movie! Oh, okay, I really have to go. Hey, and she's Capricorn. Hey, if you find her... tells him that Rigaberto has been thinking of her. I say. Good day gentlemen. So, after my work as a galactic detective, I pointed Steve in the direction... of the Hollywood Premiere Motel, where Consuela was known to frequent. Fire! Oh my God. Hello, love, I'm Mocha. Are you looking for a date? Me me... I do not think so. What? Are you some kind of fagot or so, sweetheart? No! What..? As..? It's ok... Maybe you can help me. Have you seen this girl here? What kind of Annie Oakley shit is that? Some kind of Knott's Berry Farm, I do not know. Well, this is Lupe, I saw her. Room 216. You did not see a dog, did you? Ah, this dog has intestinal problems here! There's nothing bowel problems. It's just shit everywhere! It's a nervous disorder. Whatever. Now, if you change your mind... Mocha shows you how it is. I'm good without it. Oh, I had a good time with you. Trust me! You're cute. Okay, so it's 8:36 at night. I have my required supplies. I'm going now to the lookout point, it's time for the fire to come on and get the tires on fire. Hi. Hi. John, right? Hello. Yes, hello. I 'm John, my name is John. Hello. I know, we know each other. I said your name. Yes, I'm sorry, I remember you, only... I'm not used to people remembering me. Well, how could I forget a guy who followed me through a dark alley? I should have finished the job, I'd kill you there. Sorry, I did not kill you. By the way, were you talking to yourself? Yes... No... no, I was talking here to my phone. I throw notes on the ground. Fix it. Yes. So, are you following someone tonight? Actually yes. Probably should not mention that... but, yes, I have a sweet case in hand. I'm following a graffiti artist named Salvatore Lopez. Salvatore Lopez? It could be Salvator, I'm not sure. I adore him. Oh yes? Do you know him? Yes of course. He is like the Banksy (veteran artist) of Venice. Right. I loved to see what he looks like. There are already two of us. You want me to keep you company? Yes... but you know it's just... I mean, it's not certain, you're sitting in the car. It does not matter. It's ok. Get a little content for a fun night. So go, it's my turn. Fuck, you married, you killed, Ellen DeGeneres... Oprah or Kelly Ripa? Okay, well, fuck Oprah... because she is beautiful, she is a national treasure... and if I do it right, I'm going to win a car! Look under the seats! Then I think I was marrying Ellen... just because of the sense of humor, you should want it on a wife. And she has an endless supply of suits and tennis. It is true. And dance too. Next I think I'd have to kill Kelly. Sweet, sweet death. Just because... the nature of the game is this, and someone has to die. I probably got out of my life, ruined my marriage to Ellen, so... It's fair. For me it's crazy that you... You know Salvatore Lopez, who is... Yes, he is excellent, I mean, I love how he combines... the Japanese theory of Shuko with a street-style aesthetic. Yes Yes. Also, his intimate knowledge of male anatomy is very sensual. And how the veins follow your eyes. Yes Yes. And the shadowing of the scrotum. Shut up. You know, you're kind of cute. Well, I've already been told that I'm a young Roger Daltrey... who spent a lot of time with computers. Oh, John. "FILMS FOR ADULTS - COLOR TV A.M./F.M - WATER MATTRESS" That's my little noodle!

I'm sure it's you, Lieutenant, I just do not know what happened to you. I'm running out of time, okay? The Chinese come to visit the building tomorrow.

You should have taken care of this. Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. I was, uh... distracted. You will find the graffiti artist. He is very creative. I never imagined seeing a picture like that. I will... So, Dave. You are drinking alone and the sun is still rising. I've been dumped out of my own house. I'm sorry to hear that. You know I'm there for whatever you need. I know. Promise me you'll let me be there. It's ok. I'll let you be there. Listen, I count on you to be the balance of my life. I need you to help me get around to this. I'm there for you. So, how about five of the big, more interests, for Yuri do not kill me. From the final sale in the store. "My money is your money." Thank you, man. Thank you. Seriously, thank you.

I got the Salvatore. What? Yes, I just looked at him. Oh... and... I do not know if this changes anything, but he's not Latin. He's known as Salvatore Lopez, right? But he's not... He's black. All right, I'll see you in a bit. No, that does not make me racist, I just thought you might want to... I stay here. Jesus! You must be the Salvatore. Yes. What's it? How much is this worth? 10 thousand. We do it like this, I'll give you $ 5 for it and I will not let you go to jail. Prison? Dude, I think you should get the fuck out of here! Which is? Which is? Do not move, waders. You painted the top of my head in blue. Do not you remember? Now you're going to tell me everything you know. Hey, fuck you, man! This ink does not come out! What... What did you write in his face? Or did you just jump on him? Dude, what is this, so much violence? Oh, shit. Hey, look who he is. And then, "cholos"? Where's my shit? Yeah, where the fuck is he? Dude, I'm really here. I can hear every word he says. Shut the fuck up! Hey, hey, do not talk to him like that. And you shut up, fuck! Good. I'm on good terms. We're on good terms. You and your dog's time are running out. You have not found Lupe yet, have you? You should be looking. I want my shit back! And I want my dog back. Creed. Great. You have 24 hours, "homes." Or I'll find you. Maybe you do not mind, but... You're saying 24, but your hands really say, 42. I know, when I do my gang gestures I like to practice in the mirror. Do you see this watch? This watch sucks. The clock that fits! What's the matter with you? Maybe you should leave the house now and then. I know. What are you doing? I have to steal some gang drugs back so I can get my dog back. But first I have to go and shake some real estate managers. Fix it. Do you want to come? Yes! It seems to be fun. It can be dangerous. Maybe I'll die. Hello, we're here to see Mr. Carter. Do they have marking? No, let's just say that we represent Levi the Jew. Hail, the Jew? Hail, the Jew. Hurry up. Only a moment. Hurry up? No more patience. Have a menthol candy. How can I help you, gentlemen? You're so fucked up. Sorry, sorry? Is this about money? It's always about money. It's the Tao, the Jew, then! Do you need a few dollars? No, you do not need money. But here is the agreement that will be made. You're going to make the Levite the Jew... a very generous offer for all the shit he did in his apartment building. We were thinking about 22 million. 22... 22 million? And Dave will also give Dave a brand new condo here. A bedroom and a dining room. Right on the beach, for free. Okay, this, ah... it's time for me to call the police. Excuse. Good... Well, you can show this... because right there is a signature... Authenticated... A confession under oath... by Salvatore Lopez... The graffiti artist you hired to paint the building of the L?u, the Jew... then the Chinese would lower their supply and you could buy for less. So we have agreement, right? Or am I going to have to stick your head in that fucking wall? There you go, friends. Have a nice day, all right? Goodbye. It's too little. What? It's too little. That's all Prince gave me for the material. Swear. Oscar, I would never lie to you. I have to get back to the Spyder before he suspects anything. What happens if Spyder finds out? Spyder fuck you. Where do you take my dog? I found him back. He's mine now. What? Stay here. "Go crazy." It's time. Fuck the Oscar and the Spyder fuck you. Bonus! Which is? Some things from, "if need be." I need. Where did you get this? With some drug baron? N?pia. Do you remember Dana Kaminski? Yes. Well, her old man was a cop. How nice. Grenade? Yes. Fix it. Thank you. Pouch? Yes. Ninja star? Yes. Are you sure you want to do this? What else do I have to do? I'm with you. The electrocatalyst. Good. You got a flat tire. What? Are you kidding me? Well, change that shit. Gigi does not change tires. Shit... Change that shit, or we'll be late. It's ok. Hurry up, okay? Hurry up. Female dog! What? You heard. Show. Why the hell are you taking so long, girl? I'll take it. It's ok. Where's my dog? Spyder has it. Swear. Hello, I'm Dave. I just electrocuted your friend's shit. He's taking a nap in his suitcase. I want you to try these bracelets. They are tassel. Where's the rest of the coke? It was all there was. Uh, a shot in the knee, this... this will hurt. All right, all right, I sold a guy, a black guy, Prince. Where can I find it? He's always in a bar called, Bird Cage. You're very spinning. Where are you going? You can not leave me here! Oh, do not worry... Let's call 112 for you as soon as we get out of frosques. Enjoy the arrest. What? "Pinches gringos"! It's ok. Are you ready? I'm cocky for the first time in a year. Do not know... how to respond to this statement. Hey, man, how are you? Fuck you. Is this a cover? Fuck you. Prince is waiting for us. What's in the folder? Lots of money to buy cocaine. I was thinking about using that later. Is there a back door in this place? Fuck you. Thank you very much. You're very good. Fuck you. A Manhattan, clean. Tonic Vodka. You want me to go there and do that? Slower. We're here to see Prince. Spyder sent us. The Spyder? But the Oscar yesterday sent a girl. Wait a second. He said he welcomes you, but he expects you to know what you're doing. It's the door at the end of the hall. Thank you. Prince is a modern businessman... money laundering, prostitution, drug trafficking, is there something this dude do not? These two are here as bad as the cock. Who the hell are these guys? Who the fuck are you? I 'm Steve. I 'm Dave. Okay, right, first, you gotta give me a card from this DJ, man. He is playing a song highly. Did you come here to talk to me about the DJ's son of a bitch? You're a crazy motherfucker. So go, enough of the bullshit talk, open the folder. Yeah, show me the material. Just open the folder. Show me the material. Just open the folder. Show us the stuff! Open the folder! Show us the stuff, fuck it! Son of a bitch, open the bitch of the briefcase! Show Stuff Slut! Open the motherfucker, Steve! What... what are you doing? Kill these motherfuckers. Shit! Now, what you have to do is sit back and rest. I'm just gonna hold this in my neck. Okay, be very cool. Come on, let's get up, be cool, be cool. The shit was real. You, lower your weapon, lower your weapon. Take that cocaine, put it in our briefcase and close it. Here we go... On the good and quiet side. Attention to the step. You do, boss. Fuck you. Dave, are you in control? I have. Good. Slowly, do not move, do not move, damn it, do you hear? It was a pleasure to meet you all! Hold this to me. Shit! Ah! Oh, shit! Oh, fuck you! What the fuck! Were they running for what, fuck? Son of a bitch, they're all fired! They're all fired. That's right, it's the muffins man. Did you find the cocaine? Call Spyder on the phone! Fuck you! No, do not fuck with me, Oscar. Just tell Spyder I got his coke... and I want my dog and my money, okay? So I'll come by tonight. All right, bye. Well, it was easy. Yes, it's easy to get in, it's not so easy to get out. He sure smells like the armadillo. Do you have a plan? Of course I have a plan. You see what's going on here, are not you? For the first time in your life... Katey and Taylor... You're putting them and your needs before yours. Now I'm doing a completely opposite thing. I am putting my needs before anyone else for the first time in my life. I became you, and you became you. It was straight for the nose, was not it, Dave? Okay, but I did not waste much time on that. Good news! Jesus! It's me, it's okay. What the fuck are you doing here, John? I have something for you. Hello guys. Friends, come a day earlier, the luau has been changed to tomorrow. Fuck you! Hey, Manu? Just... please. Sorry Sorry. It's ok? It does not matter. Listen, we're here... to apologize, Steve. For having given you up. Yes, he said we should. Why are you listening to the little one? He's dating our sister. How many sisters do you have? Only one. Yes, yes, it just happened. A very crazy chemistry... It was the turn of the cape. Very... very heated... in a respectable way... modest... Modesty, hot fashions. Why did not you beat him up? Mom likes him. Did you meet Nola's mother? Yes, yes... Yesterday, actually... A very enjoyable lunch. To Joan... She is a wonderful cook. And it turns out we both have passion for vintage cinema, so... So we're good here? Yeah, we're good. AND? We owe you, Steve... and if there is anything you need, come and join us. What do they have to do now? I know that here I am in the minority, but I do not love gun battles... in scary drug cartel houses. I'm more "au natural". A guy who prefers face-to-face fighting. So they stayed there and I went back to the office. You know... to do office stuff. Come on, Buddy. Do not move. Okay, let's go. Let's get out of here. Wow! Highly. The plan is no big deal, if I may say so. Stay here with the coke. I'll try to get Buddy. Keep your head down. You picked the right man for the job. Here! Fuck you... You fuck off... What the fuck, "homes"! That son of a bitch of the muffins, man! He's back, he's got me! Control the windows, I'll find that fucking muffin! Put the gun down. Does Spyder know that you and Lupe stole the whole drug? You fucked her too? Where's my coke, bitch? You lying son of a bitch. And now? We had an agreement... Your dog and your money for my cocaine. Yes. You got my coke? Comes on the way. Good. Come on, you son of a bitch! Dave. Dave! What the fuck are you doing? I'm completely out of my mind. Well, this guy belongs to us. This is for me? Yes, go there. I'll take it, I'll take it. Here it is... OK thank you. Hold it here. Here it is, come... Buddy! I missed you so much! Did you feed my dog? Pedigree... Borr?go and rice. He loves that shit. Yes, she loves it. Thanks for looking at him. No problem. Are we on good terms? Good. I'll see you around, "homes." All right, all right. Not a bad guy, this Spyder guy. So Steve got the job done. It was not executed in an orthodox way... That's right. Should he see someone for the multiple bruises he has in a 24-hour period? Certainly. Could he benefit from the help of a therapist... to solve some of your many problems? This was not for me to say. The main thing is... Steve got his dog back. Lean, the Jew fulfilled his agreement... And I, I was with the girl. I never thought I could say that. It's all yours. See if you take good care of her, will you? I'm going, Lieutenant. It's ok. Thank you very much. Yes. You did what was right. Or not... Hello! Hello. So baby. Do you like your new room? My new room is... very incredible. Thank you Uncle Steve. You're welcome. Have a good time today. I thought you might want that. Thank you. Hot Kitty! I'll have the steak. Anyway, everyone was happy. Case closed. Hello? Steve, it's me, it's John. I can not hear very well. Who is it? Here, I hear you. It's John. Yeah, look... I know you're probably all anxious... for my pasta with world-known salad... but I can not do it. So, I invite you to my party, and you bring nothing? No. I can not go to the barbecue... The salad is already done. All right, no problem, my friend. See you tomorrow. Well, yes... Hello? Steve? Looks like he hung up. This is terrible because if he does not come to us, we have to go to him... Which means you have to tell us where he is. Do not. No, I'm not going. So you're gonna have to find him... And you will not be able to find Steve. Not in Venice! He knows every corner of the area. He will disappear... He has friends in high places and has friends in low places. I did not want to mention that country music now, but... The point is that if he smells of problems, he becomes a ghost. No, literally, of course, but... Waiting. Clancy... Rewind that shit, like... one minute. What is the abode of that house that we get from the Levite, the Jew? I'm at the foot of Steve's parents' house, 845 on Holland Canal... the one with the white fence. I think it's mid-century. Seriously? And you know, the moment is perfect, because I'm starving... and I really love pasta with salad. I heard yours is world famous. Are you hungry? Want to go eat? Yes OK? We're going to a party, white man. Oh God. Please do not. Actually... Let's go. Thank you... thank you for not shooting my balls. All right, I'll stick around. Do not.
