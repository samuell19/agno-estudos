Yo, Boogie. You see them two dudes right there with the sunglasses on in the dark? Where? Right over there, coming up on the right. Yeah, I see them. Is it me or do they look like they trying to grill us all hard? That is what it seems like. So what's up? You wanna try and check them? Nah, man. Let it ride. I'm trying to get to the studio and knock these beats out. On the real, though, if we didn't have this studio session to go to, I'll tell you to pull this car over right now so we can light them fools up. They still looking at us, dawg! Chill, man. What you gonna do, man? You gonna blast on these fools just for grilling on you? You need to chill with all that! Is that him? Yeah, that's him. We got things to do. You know what? While you trippin' on that, why don't you reach in the glove compartment, grab that beat CD for me, man. I want to listen to it so I can vibe to it before I get in the studio. I'm tryin' to get this song tight. Come on, man. Yo, man, this dude better be ready. Hit Gee on the cell and let him know we out front, man. I got you, fam. Yo, what up, fam? We out front. All right, cool. Yeah. I'll be right down. All right, well hurry up because we got to go see Big D before we head over to the studio, all right? I'll be down in two seconds, man. All right, cool. - He on his way. - All right. Hey, you just going to leave like that? Baby, I'll be right back. Just goin' to hang out with Devon. Come here. Don't go and get yourself into any trouble. Nah, I'm all done with that. I'll be right back. - You better. - I promise. You know damn well you holding out on me! I swear, I gave you all I had! Well, you're short! Where's the rest of my money? Huh? Where's the rest of my money? Mom, I said my prayers. Go back in your room, son! Where's my money? I'm sick and tired of your lies! Please, stop! Please! Not in front of the baby! Baby my ass! - He's gonna kill me! - Daddy, stop! Stop! Stop! I love you, Mama. Where the hell you guys at? You already know I don't play. All right. I'll see you there in a minute. I'm leaving right now myself. Open it up. Uh, uh, uh! Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce! Tell me something, man. Why would you steal from me, of all people? Steal from you? Man, I'd never steal from you in a million years, man. - Oh, yeah? - On my grandmother's grave, man! You's a liar, and you know it. D, listen. I never lied to you! Remember back in the day when I took that bullet for you? Yeah, I remember that. You did, but now you about to take one from me. Besides all that, look who's here. Boogie! Come here, man. You remember my nephew, Boogie, right? Yeah, yeah. But, D, listen... Shh, shh. Hector. Stop playing, man. Stop playing. Come on, man. Stop playing. Come on, man. Yo, I'm sorry. Come on. Stop playing. - Remember... - Come on. You don't ever leave a trail. Come on. Yo. Yo, Boogie. Yo, yo, yo. Yo, Boogie. Remember when I bought you your first skateboard, right? Right? Come on. Nephew, what the hell you waitin' for, man? Squeeze it! Come on! This ain't nothing new to you, man, cause you know him, so what? Give me that before you hurt yourself, man. Come on, man. This ain't nothing new. You done did this a hundred times before without any hesitation. It don't matter if you know the man! Man, if they cross you, you cross them. Hector, bring the jar, man. Bruce, did you just piss yourself, man? Yo, stop... Yo stop playing with me. Look, yo, yo. I know. I know I messed up, all right? But I swear, I swear to God I'll make it up to you, yo. Yo, I swear!

Please! Please, yo stop! Come on! Stop! Come on! Come on! Don't, yo! Come on! Come on, man. Come on, man! Come on! Your days are numbered, you bastard. Oh, yeah? Well, your days are up. Anybody hungry? Anybody want to eat? All right. All right, meet us at the spot. Boogie, let them drive, man. You coming with me, all right? Boogie, in this business, you always got to be two steps ahead of your opponent, man. Two steps ahead of your opponent. Man, it's the me or them business. I'm going to tell you something, man. It ain't never going to be me. Do you understand that? Got you. Good, I know you do. I done see you did a whole lot of things in the past, man. I just want you to see what it's like to make the, uh, hard decisions in life. Look, man. Relax. It's business. It ain't personal. You know what, man? Them fools better meet us at the spot soon, man, because I'm starving. Sir, is there anything else I can do for you? No, I'm fine, Lucy. - Send the guys in for me. - Okay. - Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Good afternoon. - We found him. - Good. See this? This is what happens. The rest of the information is out there. So how you want us to approach it? Do you want us to interact with them first - or just do what we do? - Befriend them. It's always more satisfying that way. Yeah, you right about that. I love when they don't know what hit 'em. Like that last time. Okay, gentlemen, enough reflecting. We got a lot of work to do. We're almost out of time. Don't worry. We'll get the job done. We always do. Come on. Hey, girl, when's your new album coming out? Next month. Nice. Very excited. I think I hear someone coming in. Hi, Gail, how are you doing today? I'm doing well. I apologize for running a little late. That's fine. Sheila's actually waiting for you. Can I get you anything to drink? No. I'm fine. - You can have a seat. - Thank you. Hey, girl. How are you? Good. How are you doing? I'm well. Thank you. - It's nice to see you. - Likewise. Thank you so much for waiting. You know I don't like to wait for anything. Don't worry about it, girl. Come over. Let me get you started. So, how you been? Doing well, still working on this assignment. Are you still working on that assignment you were telling me about? Yes, I am. Girl, it is really none of my business, but like I told you before, you need to be careful. That man is nothing nice. You put the wrong thing out there about him, girl, it'll get ugly. You know, I'm aware of that. I'm actually thinking about it day and night. I keep coming up with the same scenario. You never know. I could move on to bigger and better things, but I do believe that people in this city need to know what's really going on. Sheila: Love you, girl. Don't want to see anything happen to you. That's all. I know you do, but don't worry about me. I'll be okay. I got angels protecting me. I still want you to come on down to the soup kitchen with me and the girls and pass out some food. Love helping people. I'll be there. You know, I do support you. It's such a special thing that you do. Now, are we going to do the treatment we did last week when you were here? Yes, we are. Well, let's get you started. Hey, China doll. China doll! Bring me some of that sushi whole! What? Now was that called for? Yes. Now get your ass out of the club immediately! Who the hell are you? I am someone that can have you leave out of here the way you came in, have you thrown out on your face! It's your choice. I ain't scared of you. - Fellas. - We're here to see Tony. - Who are you? - Tell him Big D is here. Hold on, girl. Hold on. Yeah, what? I thought I told you not to bother me when I'm conducting business up here, all right? Why didn't you... Why didn't you say so? All right. Send him up already. Later. Excuse me, doll. Play time's over, all right? All right. Listen, head downstairs and give me a heads up when Lady L gets ready to perform, all right? I'll be waiting for you. I know you will. - Go ahead. - I can't wait. I know. Go ahead, till Lady I gets ready. Let me get that, hold on. Wait a minute. Big D, my man. Good to see you. Hi, Shaft. Hey, good to see you too, Tony. Good to see you, man. Good to see you. Hey, this is my nephew, Boogie. I got to teach him a few things tonight. You're a lucky kid. You're going to learn the ropes from somebody like your uncle, especially the way he runs this city. I think you remember Hector? This is my nephew's boys, Devon and Gee. You guys, uh, kind of caught me at an awkward time, you know? When the cat's away, the mouse will play, right, fellas? - Boogie, come here. - Sup? Yo, I need you to go take care of that thing, all right? I'll meet you all out in the hallway. Hey, whoa. Take them with you, too. Tony, I don't like the changes that are going on here in this city. All right? We built this city, not those assholes. I agree. The changes are putting everybody through. It's crazy, D. Man, let me keep it real with you, bruh. All right? My people, my people been busting their ass in the Backbay for years, and them asshole politicians, man, they don't care! Look, I know I can go on for hours talking about them. All right? But right now we need to talk about us. I agree. We can go on for hours talking about them. Let's talk some business. - I'm all ears. - All right. Look, man, here's the deal. A week from Tuesday I got a shipment coming in from Miami. I need your help on it. Sounds good. What's my cut? Seventy-thirty. Come on, D. I'll be the one taking all the risk here. All right, all right, Tony. All right, man. You killing me. Dude, what are you doing? All right, look, 60/40 my side. That's it. Hey, now we got a deal. How about some hand-rolled Cubans? I got a couple left. I'd love for you to have one. Oh, shit. Excuse me, D. Yeah, what is it, Nick? Yeah, hey, boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm down here at Donnatello's, and Johnny B's down here having a sit down with a group of guys, you know? He's running off at his mouth again about you, and it really ain't good. What? The freakin' idiot. That's it. This guy's got to go. Listen, I'm in a meeting right now, Nick. Keep an eye on that freaking idiot for me. I'll get back to you a little bit later. You know what I'm saying? If you want, I'll keep an eye on him. Yeah, okay. That's it. I've had it with this freakin' jerk off. Listen, D. I need a favor. In fact, it's a big one. And what's this? Ordinarily, something like this, you know, I'd take care of it myself. But this is, uh, a family thing, you know? I can't have it come back on me. This guy, he's gone too far this time! What do you need? This guy, Johnny B, he's a real big mouth. He been running his mouth, and it's starting to affect my business! Bottom line. I need this guy to go bye-bye, like, yesterday! Don't worry. I'll take good care of you. Just can't come back on me. That's all. Why don't you tell me what you have in mind? Hey, you want a drink? Yeah, I'll take a drink. Thank you. You're welcome. So, tell me, you like working here? It's all right. The owner, Tony, takes good care of you girls? If you're a new girl? Yes. What does that mean? Let's just say that he makes sure that we get to powder our nose. Does he provide the powder? I said too much. Let me show you to the twins. - Hi, Joanne. - Hi, Lady I, how are you today? I'm good. Thank you. I came to get that jacket I've been dreaming about. Oh, yeah. Come on, girl. Let's go try it on. Let's go. I think this is the one, isn't it? Yes. This is the one. Oh, this is gorgeous. Tony's going to love this. As you all know, a lot of our history is planted right here in Boston, right? A lot of people worked hard that made sacrifices to build this city. Some of the greatest people we know, the artists, politicians and civil rights workers who worked hard to build great legacies right here in Boston, yet day after day we're losing control. Excuse me, boss. With all due respect, it sounds like you're trying to give us a history lesson. See, Kenny, man, if you would shut your mouth and listen, you might learn something for a change, man. Man, you know, that's the problem with you knuckle heads today, man! Always flapping your mouth when somebody trying to teach you something! Now, the next brave person to open his mouth while I'm talking is going to be sipping his next meal through a straw! I'm making a point here! Now, as I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, you all know back in the day we took a whole lot of things from a whole lot of people. And that's why I'm not letting the powers that be come into this city and move us out like it's okay. That's why I'm putting everybody on notice. Any and all business done in this city comes through us first. Yeah, go ahead, Kenny. So you're saying this only applies to white people who run business here? Did I say only white people, Kenny? No, man. All business! White, Hispanic, Latino, all means all, man! Kenny: But what if they decide they don't want to run their business here? Do you really have to ask that, Kenny? Man, we're going to be making a whole lot of visits. We're going to talk to them in a way to make them understand. Not everybody catches on at first. There's always slow learners. So we're going to be tutoring them to make them understand the lesson. Now, next order of business. Devon and Gee, did you reach out to who I told you to in regards to Tony's situation. It's done. I talked to Nick. Good. Kenny, what's up with Chester? He's underwater right now. He's gotta come up for air soon. When he does, I'll be waiting on his ass. Benny, you got a problem with a hangnail or something? Problem? No, sir. No problem at all. Well then maybe I'm the one that got the problem 'cause word on the street is that you're doing business outside the family. You know anything about that? I don't know what you hearing on these streets, but you shouldn't believe everything you hear. But you ain't going to be having no more problems with your hangnail, man. What you mean by that? What you say, Benny. Huh? What up, Benny. What was that? What was that? What'd you see? What'd you see? Who's that? What you see, Benny? Come on. Come on. Anybody else want to dance? What's that, Benny? What was that? Anybody else want to dance? What's up, Benny? What did you say, Benny? You know what I mean, Benny? Get your ass on out my sight! I don't ever want to see you again! You hear me? You two must be John and Mark, I assume? Tony told me you was coming. Said something about a studio. Yeah. He said he talked to you about it already. Well, tell me what you looking for? Hold on. Fellas, you all know what you got to do. Split. Gentlemen, have a seat. Well, first off, Mr. Smith, I'd like to thank you for taking the time out to talk to us. My partner and I would like to speak to you about using one of your properties, be able to house a nice recording studio, entertainment company and whatever terms are going to make you comfortable, we're willing to do that. It all sounds good. Like I told Tony, we have some artists I want to bring to the next level. We did our research on you guys. Seem like you know your business very well, but why Boston? I could tell you there's some real good people out here. They just need that little bit of help. So my partner and I, we're here to give that to them. We're all in. Let's get to work. Sounds good to me. What I'll do is I'll send my people to reach out to you and put everything together. Okay. Should be nice to do business with you. We are ready to get to work. Thanks for speaking with us. Gentlemen. What the hell, son? You don't knock first? Sorry. My bad. Can I come in? Yeah. Close the door behind you. I want to talk to you. You know, I can remember a time when I could trust the people around me? But no more. Now you got to watch everybody. I thought Benny was a real dude. Benny? Man, you can't trust anybody. Greed, lust, jealousy and a man's lust for a woman is his greatest weakness. Remember that. I was thinking after your birthday of sending you to stay with your uncle in California. After meeting them two cats, John and Mark, I believe in you as an artist, and I think they can help you. Why was you thinking about sending me away to Cali? Man, I think the change would be good. Now, there's a new path. Okay. But I really don't understand. You ain't got to understand everything. Look, man, just go and get your head together and listen to those two dudes, John and Mark, as they help you to become a better artist. Get out of here, man. I need some time to myself and close the door on your way out. - Hey, girl, how you doing? - Hey, Mary, how are you? I'm doing good. What's going on? Just working. - Hey, girl. How's it going? - Hey. - How are you, Sheila? - I'm well. Thank you so much for helping me out today. I really appreciate it. I need the help. No problem. But as soon as the line dies down, I need to follow up on that interview that I have today. Oh, the line is crazy. - Interview? - Yes. - Are you still covering that? - I am. Oh, my God. I'm so concerned, but I know you'll do your best and everything. - Just be careful covering him. - Yeah. You know how ugly that could become. All right. I hope all is well. Talk to you soon. Mary, can I see you for a bit out here? - I'll see you out there. - All right. I'll see you. - Okay. - Okay. Hey, you see that lady over there? That's the one who's been asking everybody for $10. - That's her over there? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's go over and talk to her. All right. Hello. How are you? Do you mind if I have a seat? It appears the seat to be unoccupied, right? My name is Sheila. This is Mary. What's your name? My name is April Marie Thomas, but people call me Ms. Marie. Nice meeting you, Ms. Marie. I really enjoy the food here. It really is always so hot and fresh. Thank you. That makes us feel special. Ms. Sheila, can I ask you for a really big favor? Sheila: Sure. Absolutely. Would you be able to at least loan me $20? - Twenty dollars? - Ms. Marie: Yes. It's to get over to visit with my daughter and buy my grandson a birthday gift today. I can get the $20 back from her and pay you back tomorrow. Don't worry about it. It's a gift from me to your grandson. Bless you, my child. Sheila: Enjoy it. I'd better let you get back to what you were doing. - Think we should take off now? - Mm. It was very nice meeting you. Your food will be right out. Ms. Marie, next time have your daughter come see me, okay? Carmen, it's Curtis. What do you want, Curtis? I want you to meet me over at the spot. No. I'm not going to meet you over there. Just meet me at the spot now, okay? I don't... Get in the car. Get in the damn car! Why you always giving me such a hard time every time you see me? What do you want from me, Curtis? What's going on with you? Where's Tina and Karen and your African bush friend, - Kuma, been lately? - Her name is Kimmy. What do I look like, their mama or something? You listen to me, you half a damn wet back. You forget your business is my business. You only out here because I allow you to be out here tricking. I'm going to ask you one more time. Answer me wrong, you going to be sucking on some of this hot lead, now where them tramps at? They went to Tony's club. I was over there the other day. I didn't see them there. Tammy gave them a job over there. In the back of the spot, there's a private VIP area. They work there. That's not going down like that. I won't have anyone stepping on my toes, especially a jerk like Tony. I'll take care of his ass. I don't know why I even messed with you or anything like you! Come over here and do what you're good at. First you stick your gun in my mouth and now you want me to please you? You're right. I might catch something from your nasty mouth. Get the hell out of my car! Smell like ass crack anyway! Can I at least get a rock or two for all of this trouble? I'll be back for my money later. Get your ass to work! Who did you make contact with? Thus far, we met with Tony and Lady I at the club. Set a meeting up with Mr. Smith, said he'd go ahead and give us that studio we asked for. Only thing he wants in return is for us to work with his nephew. Did you earn their trust? Yes, we did, and I think it's time to execute the plan. I will not be far behind. Okay. Let us get our coats and get back to work. Send Lucy in for me, please. What did I do? Shut up. No, let me go. He's here now. All right. Yo, man. What the hell happened to you? You look like you slept in your clothes. Take it easy, bro. I woke up. I found everything was in the cleaners. That's all. Okay. I know you own an iron, though, right? What's the problem? You don't like what I have on? No, man. I'll tell you what. I know you think you look good, and I know we ain't been working that long as partners and all, but I got to be honest, man. You look like shit. Fine, although I don't see a problem with what I have on nor do I understand why it would bother anyone else here. Whatever, man. Look. Here's the prints from the latent at the Bodega the other night. Johnny Michaels paroled two months ago. Good, good. Well, I have something for you too. Check out these hot new pictures I got. Okay. What the hell is all this? It's a little something I thought you might enjoy. By the way, how's Sharon? It's Karen, and she's fine. Isn't life funny? I bet in all these years of married life you never thought you'd have a full on affair with a hooker? Yo, man, look. Okay? Karen's not just a hooker. She's just somebody I'm developing a friendship with. That's it. I hear that. And I just want to say I'm happy for you, man. Besides, you know it's the poor rat where there's only one hole to run into, right? I just wanted to show you these, a couple of shots of you and your friend. This is bullshit! Oh, wow. Yeah, she's a real winner, all right. This is my favorite shot. Take a look at that look on your face. She caught you when you were right... Hey, that's cool. They come in double sets. Remember? Made myself a few sets I'd hide them somewhere safe, though, if they was my pictures. You know how wives are, always snooping around. Tell me something. You know anything about Tony working those girls over at his club? Some of them work for themselves. What? How can you even ask me that right now? Besides, why does it matter? We're partners, right? You're not mad at me, are you? No, man. I tell you what, I ain't mad at you. But I'll tell you what you can do, why don't you go down and talk to Mr. Tony yourself or Big D? You're the one who deals with them all the time, right? Don't ask me anymore stupid questions. Let me tell you something, my friend. You need to learn to lighten up or this job will kill you. Those people we deal with out there, scum! You and me are all we got in this dog eat dog world. And that's just how they see us. It's them, and it's us. So that stuff you thought you were going to do when you decided to become a cop to protect and serve, just a freakin' slogan on the side of a black and white riddled with bullet holes by the nice citizens who want you dead. This is real life, my friend. In this dog eat dog world, we signed on to be the dog catchers. So back off all that sensitivity shit and learn to take a joke because the bad guys will laugh loud and hard when it comes time to hand your wife a folded flag as a reminder of what you used to be. Okay. If what you're saying is true, fine. I'll look into it, and I'll ask Karen some questions. Good, because Tony can't be making money off these women like that. Who does that? You hungry? Oh, did you find out who those two dudes that were looking at me at Tony's club the other day? Yeah. No one's ever seen them before. I know they talked to Tony and also took a meeting with Big D that night, but it's all I know. What do you got a taste for? We can go on out and find some place to grab something quick. Well, well, if it isn't the two lost souls from the club. What are you guys up to? Going about our business. We just got a call, someone fitting you guys' description just robbed a woman a few blocks from here. We sure did. So what does it have to do with us, officer? Why are you guys putting so much energy into us? You know we're not the ones you're looking for. Besides that, we know what you saying is not true. I agree with that. That's it. Come on! Up against the car. Put your hands on the car. Come on, man. Who's this? Your dealer? No, it's not. What's this? You both know that does not belong to us. Looks like cocaine to me, buddy. Radio: B to 04, B to 04. Come in 04. Yeah, 04. Go ahead. Yeah, it's cocaine, all right, my friends. All right, if it makes you feel good. Gotta do what you gotta do. We got Johnny Michaels held up at 222 W 102. I repeat 222 W 102. 10-4. We're rolling on it now. Hey, they got Michaels. Let's roll. I'll be back for you two later. We're watching you both. You do that, officers. You do that. Where's Benzito at? How you doing, buddy? My name is Nick. He's not here tonight, but if you want a drink or something like that, come on in. You want a drink? Come on in. I would like to take this moment to propose a toast to my nephew, Boogie, on hittin' the big 3-0 today. What time you got, man? 10:30. Cool, cool. We got some time then. Yo, man. That was bullshit the way Big D got at Benny, man. How you know Benny ain't have that coming? Nah, man. Benny's a straight up soldier, dawg. How you know that, cuz? Check it. Me and Benny did a bid together. You get to know somebody behind those walls, man. Yeah, whatever, man. Look, people need to learn not to talk so much when they out here on the streets. Come on, dawg, man. What you saying? I can't talk? No, you can't talk! Matter of fact, go ahead, talk. Go ahead, talk. End up on that same list that Benny's on. Keep focus, man. Here's to you, nephew, and on your new career as an artist. Hey, everyone! I really appreciate it, on the real. I wish Devon and Gee was here though. Come here, man. Now, look, I know I've been running some business, but know this. I will always have your back. All right? I love you like a son, man. So, enjoy. The night's young, and, man, this is all for you, man. It's all yours. Thanks, Uncle D. Hey, that's what family's for. We have to look out for one another, man. Hey, yo, man. Make sure your cellphone's on, dawg. I'm about to go up in here, man. I got you, man. You can hear me calling you, man. - I got you, man. - All right. So drink up, enjoy. This will be a night to remember. Cheers. So I says to this jerk off, I says, "Tony don't run me, and Tony don't scare me." Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies. It's not my birthday. My nephew. Make him happy. And if he keeps going the way he's going, he's going to end up sleeping next to the damn Titanic. Because you know what Tony's problem is, Tony wants to be bigger than he is, and he thinks he's bigger than he is because he runs around all day long, and he pushes around these clowns! But if he ever came after me, if Tony ever came after me, do you know what I would do? I would have him dancing in a little thong like one of the chicks in this joint. Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Honey, honey. You guys serving moolies in here now? You know this is how it starts, right? Next thing you know, you're going to be serving pigs feet and some chick named Laquisha with a bone in her nose is going to be serving me drinks. Hey, Kunta. Where's your elephant at? Getting valet parked or what? Hey! I says, is your elephant getting valet or what? Don't ignore me, punk! I think he's with your sister! You heard what this fool said to me? Let's get him. Come on. Thought you was gonna step to this? What the hell is going on here, man? I don't know, master. Looks like Kunta strikes back. You got to be kidding me. Nick, come on, man. Do I look like I'm kidding? Wait, Nick. You want this one? This will prove to your Uncle Tony he sent the right guy to get the job done. Hell yeah. Yeah. Okay. - It's done. - Cool. Thanks. I'll be right back. How you doing? Hey, Pop. I'm good. - You got this? - Yeah. Don't worry. I'm good. Raise up. Salut. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go... Told y'all. Don't play with me. Pay up, suckers. Thank you. Hey, yo! Call the cops! Johnny B and Vito just got whacked! Buy me a drink. I got to go to the bathroom. I can't believe Tony has me and all the girls working this hard. Can I get a Long Island Iced Tea and a Cosmo with Kettle One with a splash of Grand Marnier. Oh, whoa, whoa, excuse me, baby girl. I ain't a baby girl or your baby mama! But I wouldn't mind if I was though. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, I seen you in here several times and I noticed you been checkin' me out! So I figured I'd just roll up and give you your shot to be my girl. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rudolph, but you can call me Rudy once you get to know me better. So what's your name, baby? Come on, Rudolph, man. Hey, come on, brother. Come on, brother. This is what I do. This is what I do! You know what just happened? I came out the bathroom and run right into Big D. You know what he says to me? He says, "Excuse me, baby girl." I was like, "I'm not your baby girl or your baby mama." What? Girl, are you crazy or stupid? I know. I know. You must be trying to get yourself killed. Just drink your drink and don't let your boss, Tony, see you. If Big D goes and tell Tony, I will definitely get fired. You having a good time, son? Hell, yeah, Unc! I'm glad to hear that. Hey, man. I just seen you throw a girl down on the dance floor a little while ago. Yeah, that was nothing but some chick. You know, I handle my business like you, Unc. What she do to you, man? Nothing. I guess I just felt like doing it, you know what I'm saying? Listen to me, nephew. I want you to listen to me real clear. What I do, I do for business, but what you just did out on the dance floor, man, that's bullshit! Don't ever confuse the two. Oh, yeah? Where he at? Outside in the car. Boogie, I'll be right back. I can explain, Big D! Let me pop this fool, boss! - Let me pop this fool! - Shh. Let me pop him, boss! Let me pop him! Let me pop him! My old friend, Chester. Now, we ain't seen each other in a while, Chester. We sure do have a whole lot of catching up to do, now don't we? Big D, I know I owe you, but you're never going to believe what happened. Three weeks, three weeks, Chester. No calls, no text, no nothing. Man, you done pulled a Houdini on me. Now if you was in my shoes, what the... What the hell would you think? I can explain that, Big D. Explain? Really? Big D, I swear to God, I would never try to screw you. My word is bond, man. Chester, where the hell is my money? Right. Okay. So, I go to Miami, and I meet Raul just like you told me to. I get your money and no problem. Save me the bedtime story. All right. You right. You right. So, real talk. So, Raul picks me up at the airport. He takes me to the yacht. They show me who's who and what to look out for. Sounds like a good, nice story. Now, where the hell is my money? All right. All right. So, I'm at the crap table keeping an eye on Pedro, and I'm killing 'em, right? So at about 5:30 in the morning, I go to the airport. I get into the chair. I order a Coke, I take a sip. Right? So, I take... I decided to take a nap because I started getting tired so I take a nap. Next thing you know I'm waking up to the plane saying, "We're landing. We're landing." So I wake up. I look down and I see your briefcase is down where I put all your money right at my feet. She must have slipped me a mickey, man, and took the briefcase. Man, are you trying to tell me that a flight attendant robbed you of my 40 G's? Is that what you trying to tell me, Chester? I'm sorry, man! I'm sorry! God! Now, you listen up. You got three days, three days to bring me my money! The next thing I cut off ain't going to be your motherfucking finger. I'm sorry, man! So lucky! Get him out of here! Okay. We all know Big D's the man, right? First we got to go down to Tony's club and bust him to get to Big D. So when the setup's in place, you got to text me 111. When you hear us in the club, then you'll know the thing is in place. - Are we clear? - Uh-huh. Yes, sir. Okay. Let's go then. Yo, slim. - Yeah? - Clean that mess up. Sorry about that. Boogie, that record is coming out amazing. Just going to need you to go ahead and add some ad-libs to it, okay? - All right. No doubt. I got you. - Thank you. All right. Also, Luccia, I would listen to the first verse of "Best Love". I think we need to add some ad libs to it - to give that extra. Okay. - No problem. Let's go. Hey, that's good. Boogie, we're all set with that. I think we're all set with that. - You sure? - Yeah. We got that. Hey, Lady I, don't forget to hit the ad libs on that second verse, all right? All right, sweetheart. Yeah. It's going to be a good one. Cool. - We're good with that. - Good job. Boogie, that was a great job. We're going to go on to the next song. We're gonna need Luccia. - Oh, my God. Is this Karen? - What? Let me see that thing. No, you asshole. Come on, man! Ready to go bust these clowns? Yeah. Come on, let's go. Tony's club, one second. Tony's club. Hold on. I know, right? You know what? I got to go to work. I'll see you later. Okay? - Bye. - Ciao. Ask the girl that's on line one and the other on line two. Hold on. Stop moving around. Get over here. Hey, what's going on here? - This one tried to rob me. - What are you, out of your mind? Man: This one tried to take my wallet. What are you talking about? Tony: Hey, what the hell is going on here? This guy set the whole thing up, man. What the hell kind of place are you running here anyway? Hey, guys. Come on over here. Come on. Come on. Mr. Tedeski, we're placing you under arrest. For what? Running an illegal prostitution ring. Yeah, says you. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney... Did a little research on you, Tony. Found what you're looking for, Detective? Yeah, seems like your family has some pretty deep roots in this city, been in the business of flesh sales for some time now. Grandson of one of the first hitmen in the city. And there's your uncles, main men in the city. Then there's your father, found dead in a meat locker down by the docks. Boston historian, are you? What are you going to do? You going to book me or write my autobiography already? Let me share something with you, Mr. Tedeski, just for the illegal prostitution ring and the drugs we found in your club, you're facing ten years on ice, easy. Now, if you decide to cooperate, I might be able to convince the D.A. to go light on you, and we can, let's see, help each other out. I got your ledger, and I'm going to bust everyone down there, including Big D. So, maybe we can become partners. Let me tell you something, Detective. You got a better chance of growing wings and flying off like an angel, all right? Fine. We'll do it your way. Take him to a cell. I suggest you keep your big nose clean or I'll be there to bust you, shut you down before God gets the news. Tony: Is that a threat, Detective? No. That's a promise. Tony: You got me all nervous. Jenkins, you smell something? What do you mean? All of a sudden the room smells like cheap cologne. Get him out of here. Come on. Come on. Let's go! Come on! Get up! Get up! Let's go! Yeah, this is Detective Bennett. I need a favor. Julio, why don't you take the car around the corner real slow. License and registration. Whoa, ese, slow down. No sudden movements. - What's up, man? - Thanks a lot, man. All right, no problem. Step out of the car. Keep your hands where I can see them. Hector, Hector, Hector. Seems like you're driving on a suspended license. My license is not suspended, bro! Yo, Bennett! Check it out. Hector, are you selling drugs on my streets? Look what we got here. Woo! Oh, a concealed weapon. You know, Hector, you already have two strikes against you, this makes your third. Three strikes and you're out. - You're a lucky man, bro. - What's that, big man? Do you know I used to bust up suckers like you on the inside every day? Step away from him! Get away from him! Shoot him! Yo, what the hell, man? Bennett: He's crazy, he tried to kill me! Shit! Don't stand there like an asshole. Go grab backup. Shit, man! Man, I know you had something with my guy being taken out by that piece of crap cop, Bennett, Tony. Hey, I'm telling you. I had nothing to do with it. - You must be crazy, D. - You listen to me, Tony. Our business together is over. I know you been trying to set me up this whole time! You lucky if I don't put your lights out for you right now! Hey, you think what you want. I know what that freaking crooked cop is after. It's my ledger with all my business in it. Hey, because you see when they arrested me, he says, "Oh, maybe we can go in business together." - The ledger? - Yeah, the ledger. It's got the names, everybody we did business with in it. What in the hell would make him think of something like that? Hey, I don't know. It's almost like somebody tipped him off. Told him what kind of business we got going on in the VIP area. I'll tell you what. Give me the ledger right now! I don't need nothing coming back to me. Come on, man! Come on, Tony! Hey, I know you don't think I'd be setting you up, D. Man, if you don't give me that ledger right now, you won't have to worry about anything else ever again! Including your Lady I. - Oh, it's like that, my brother? - Yeah, it's like that! And don't you call me brother! You know my name! Hey, I don't have that freaking ledger. The crooked cop, he's got it. What the... Tony, you stay the hell out of my way from now on! Okay? If anything comes back to me, and I mean anything, I'm coming to see you! Now I got to go try to stop that asshole from bringing me down! After that shipment from Miami, business between you and me is no more. All right? You get it? Caput! Hey, meet me in my office. Right now! Hey, come on in. - Hey. - Really, Tony? Did you really think you'd get away with this? Joey, what are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. Johnny B. I got your nephew, Nick, in a body bag downstairs. He sung like a little bird. Hey, come on. You know who I am. Yeah. I know who you are. You're a dead man talking. You know you can't whack a main man without family approval. Come on. Let's take a walk. I'm telling you, Joey. You got it all wrong. You got it all wrong I'm telling you, Joey. It's not like that. Oh, my God. John. John, I need to see you and Mark right now. - Hello. - Bennett. - Who's this? - Big D. Oh, I was just thinking about you. We got a lot to talk about. That is why I'm calling you. Now, you meet me at the old warehouse on Dorchester Avenue at four. I'll be there at four. And you better not try anything funny, you jerk, or I'll have your ass. You got that? Just meet me there and be ready to do business and bring that ledger with you. I need that. I'll be there, alone. You better not come with anything less than a million cash. Just meet me there, and I will take care of you. I need that ledger back. I'm out. Boogie, like I said, I need to make a move for a while, so I need you to hold things down. I got... I don't need you asking me any questions. Now, you got it? - I got you. - Good. I'm getting ready to leave now. Okay, cool. Who you taking with you? No one. I need to go alone. Remember, hold things down. I got it. Yeah. I know you do. Yo, I know this has something to do with that meeting with Tony earlier today. What are you talking about? Well, while you was in the studio laying that joint down with Tony's girl, him and your uncle was beefin'. Over some ledger or something, dude. Are you serious? Let's see what's up with that, yo. Been a busy man, huh, brother? I am not your brother. Sell out! I know you not my brother, scumbag. You know, you got a lot of mouth. Really? Hand over the bag and let's be done with this. Man, I ain't giving you nothing until you hand me that ledger. Now, come on! I really didn't think you were this stupid. Hand over the money. Where you're going, you won't want for anything else, ever again. Oh, is that right? Yeah. That's right. Well, maybe you need to tell that cute boy that's about to drop you right now, brother! What are you doing? Are you crazy? No, man. You can't keep doing this! It ain't right! Who are you? Save a bro or something? No. I'm finally doing what's right. I did sign up to serve and protect, unlike you! What are you doing here, man? What is this? I wouldn't do that, son. Who the hell are you to tell me what I don't want to do? I'm someone you're really going to have a problem with. Now, go on, son. Let him live. He saved your life. Man, what the hell has this got to do with you? Got everything to do with me. Just let him live. Besides that, I know you hear those sirens. You need to get far, far away from here while you still have a chance. You okay? Yeah. Thank you. Who are you? I'm someone looking out for you. Let me ask you a question. Did you help Bennett because he was blackmailing you? Yeah. That's the only reason I was still working with him. I already told my wife what happened, and she ended up leaving me. That's what happens when you're not right. What about Big D now? He's going to come back after me. It's not going to happen. He's got other things to worry about. Get your life together. Don't let any of this get back to Lady I or Big D's nephew. I got your word on that? Yeah. You have my word on that. Do your homework. Everything's recorded. Show your higher ups and you'll be fine. Thank you again. Just know, there's angels around you.
