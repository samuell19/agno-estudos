I'm telling the truth! No way! It's true! She's afraid of a peep-hole. She can't peep through the hole. Why? Why? It beats me. Yumi-chan. Yumi-chan! Why are you "Peep-Hole Phobia?" That's not it. Natusmi is making up stories. No, I'm not. In the physical exam, she could not take the "Eye Test". Just because she feels... something scary inside the hole. Sounds like a trauma. In man's memory the most difficult one to forget is "fear", they say. Is that so... There is a friend of mine... who lives in an apartment whose previous tenant committed suicide. He once told me... in the bathroom, when he was washing his hair, he felt something behind him. Bringing up goose bumps. When he tried to look back, On his shoulder, he saw a very abnormally thin... woman's hand... Woowahhh... Yoko! What happened to you? My junior friend of mine at high school died. Say... eh? April 16 21:44 PM. Why did she die? While scuba diving, she got lost from her friends and ended up drowning. April 16 (Wed) 21:44 PM. Death by suffocation is excruciating painful, they say. When her body was recovered, her face showed gruesome pain. Yoko, a phone call. Eh? That's not my Chaku-Melody Ringing Tones. But it's Yoko's phone that is ringing. From whom? No name. Just phone numbers. What?! Chakushin Ari You've got a call. What is this? What's up? This is my Cell phone number. Huh? Playing the "Recorded Message 1417" 21:45 PM. There is one recorded message in your Inbox. The latest messages... #1 18th... eh?! Evening... 11:04 PM The message is... Oh no! Iyada! It's started raining. Ame Futte Kichatta. Oh, no! Iyada! It's started raining. Ame Futte Kichatta. Isn't this voice... There is no way that you get a call from your own Cell phone. Then, what is it? Besides "18th" means the day after tomorrow. It's Yoko's voice, isn't it? How on earth is it possible! Do you know what you are saying? Aah! It must be a prank joke from your boyfriend. If I had a boyfriend, I wouldn't come to Gokon party. (singles party) If you're really single and free, why not go to Kawaguchiko Lake? A friend of mine owns a hotel pension there. Sounds great! I'm on! I'll organize everything. Give me your Cell phone numbers. Sure thing. OK... Pass this to Yumi-chan. Eh? Yumi-chan's number. Sure. Police Morgue. Rina's corpse. What are you doing? Nothing. Why are you so anti-social? We must keep her body at the Police. The circumstances strongly suggest homicide now. Mr. Caretaker... Your sister's name... Was that Ritsuko-san, wasn't it? Among the various indications of the Child Abuse and Neglect, There is a case we should discuss. For example... one child hits other child's head for small matters, Thus, showing wild and violent behavior. Introductory Child Psychology Nyumon Jido Shinri Gaku a daily contact with such a child... can see that one finds a much more weaker figure as his target... Shunsuke I have another enragement. I must cancel today's date. Shunsuke. I have another enragement. I must cancel today's date. You are damping Shunsuke now? Yes. Kenji is cool, isn't he? My kind of type... To other children, small and or weak ones... Hey you! You in "Purple" dress! Hey you! What's the theme of this lecture? "Abuse"... Gyakutai ga... creates "Abuse"... Gyakutai o umu... ...probably... Mitaina... Mmm... that's correct. For each of the case studies, we'll discuss next week. I must be going now for my part time work. See you! She is so carefree now. What's up? Nothing... Yes? Yumi? Yes. Do you want to join me for shopping tomorrow? Eh? There's swim suit sale. Kenji says he likes sea. I want to pick up a cute one to impress him. OK Yoko, where are you right now? What? I can hardly hear you. It's about time we found a new part-time job. What's going on? Yumi? Can you hear me? Hello~! Yoko! That voice message's time! 18th! Isn't that 11:04 PM tonight? Voice message? Sorry, I can't hear anything. Eh?! What did you say? Oh, no! It's started raining. Oh, no! It's started raining. Yoko... Aaaaaaaaahhhh! April 18 23:04 PM. Aaaaaaaaahhhh! Yoko! What's up?! Yoko! Yoko! What are you doing right here? Did you hear... that Yoko... didn't die instantly? Eh?! Her "right arm and leg" was chopped off. But she was still conscious... Out of dying breath, she reached for help. No way... I bet... she was killed... ...Yoko Senpai... What do you mean by "killed"? Tell me what you know, please! Yoko-senpai did receive a call from her own Cell phone. So? Death-messaging call! Death-messaging call? Rina received the call. Rina? Who is she? Is she the one who died from diving? After killing Rina. From Rina's Cell phone, it called Yoko Senpai's Cell phone. What do you mean by "killed"? You know who killed her? I'm not so sure... But I heard it's a woman who had left grudges in this life. Eh? Through Cell phones, it finds the next victim. And then... It picks a new victim from the Cell phone's memory. And keeps on killing people, as chain call of death. You had better register your Cell phone number as "Never Accept Calls From This Number" Chakushin Kyohi. Let's go! April 21 15:28 PM. Yoko died. 3 days ago... in a train accident. Does it have anything to do with that prank call? Itaden (Itazura Denwa) Yes. Same day, same time. Leaving the same message as in the recorded ones. It's definitely fishy, isn't it? But... The cause of her death is suicide. This isn't my voice, is it? The 1st message is... 21st... 15:34 PM... Shoot! Yabe~! I totally forgot... Kanzen wasureteta. No way... Waaaaaaaahhh! No way! That sort of thing would never happen! "21st" means today! Only 2 minutes to the appointed hour. There is no way! You're trying to frame me, aren't you?! Aah, it must be... Mikamis asked you to do this. Right? No, Kenji-kun, that's not it! You made it all up, didn't you? It's a sick joke! I almost got caught! Hey! Kenji! What? Oh, yo! Don't "Oh, yo!" me. Aren't you the one who called us to decide what to show at a school's culture festival? Shoot! I totally forgot... April 21 15:34 PM. Waaaaaaaahhh! Is this the right floor? What's up? Police Interrogation, alright... but it is intended for general reference purposes only. Kawai Kenji-kun fell down from the elevator shaft by accident. Even testified by his friend. That was not it. I've already told the other person. Yoko and Kenji's Cell phones received... Okazaki Yoko-san plunged to her death from a railway bridge into a moving train. There are witnesses who claim to have seen her jump. If that's not suicide, what do you call it? I don't know... but... She must have been a drug user. There is no way. Everything in life has its challenges and its reasons... Any crime can be explained logically. Beyond common sense, that one unthinkable, unmistakable thing is happening right now. Is that so? Thank you for your cooperation. So what they'd told us became true. From Yoko's Cell phone to Kenji's Cell phone... It's true Yoko's Cell stored Kenji's number. In Kenji's Cell phone our phone numbers were stored... It's from a boyfriend from high school days. Hello? Natsumi! It's the same Ringing Tone... as Yoko's case. Not mine. Yumi... You've got a call. (1) Message. Why? I turned off the power source. April 23rd... The day after tomorrow... April 23rd (Wed) 22:39 PM Caller Konishi Natsumi. Ah... Wahhhh! Noooo! Hey you guys! What are you doing? I don't trust these things, but you know... I talked with Megumi. No worry. It's just a rumor... Keep your chin up. See you. Yumi, you should delete your number. You, too, want to delete your numbers, don't you? I'm sorry. I just want to make sure this is supposed to work... Delete mine, too. Me, too! Mine, too! Hey! Yumi! This is the cancellation form. Kindly fill in this form. Yes. Do you wish to carry back your phone? Dispose it, please. Yes, please. I understand. We'll reset the data inside. There is nothing to worry about your security. Roll the film! Which one is Konishi Natsumi-san? Are you Konishi-san? You are Konishi Natsumi-san who has received a death-messaging call. Please don't! We have our resident Psychic Medium. Do you want us to perform Jyorei, Exorcisms? Jyorei? I know you're pressed for time. 22:39 PM tomorrow will come shortly. Natsumi, let's go. Move away, please. Wait! Can I see your Cell phone? She had already canceled the contract. Eh?! Is that right? Imai! Yes! Give me your Cell phone! Your phone! Quick! Hold this! Hold this. Shoot the Cell phone first. Konishi-san! Is this the Cell phone that received a death-messaging call? What are you saying?! Natsumi! Will you stop it already?! What the hell is going on? Stop everything. Konishi-san... This is really bad. The death might really come to you. You had better talk to the Psychic Medium. Come with us. We'll help you. You know Tendo-sensei, don't you? Famous for Jyorei, Exorcism. I'm sure he will help you. Let's go. We'll go back to the studio. Natsumi! Let her go! Yumi... I'll go with them. I don't want to be like "Yoko and Kenji." OK, let's go. You go down the stairs and shoot when we are coming out. Yes. Let's go. I'm sorry. Wait! If you know something, tell me, please. Unless otherwise, Natsumi is doomed to die! When was it? Appointed time? Tomorrow... 10:39 PM. Isn't it Yoko's... Why do you have her... The time she was hit by a train? 11:04 PM. One minute later, This is the number, her Cell phone called. Outgoing History April 18th 23:05 PM Called Number 0352293339. What does it mean? Yoko called? Not possible! Her right hand that grabbed the Cell phone was chopped off. And it was found in a different place where the rest of the body was found. Then, who called? Who the hell called the number? April 22nd 15:23 PM Called Number 0352293339. Oct 17th 16:32 PM Called Number 0352293339. The same number. Whose number is this? You call the number now. "The number you have dialed is not in use." "Please check the number and dial again." Whose Cell phone is this? It's my sister's. 6 months ago... She got a call from her own Cell phone. 3 days later, she died from fire. Jawbreaker? Yeah. Why such a thing? No idea. When my sister was rescued, she was still alive. She was suffering from 10 degree's burn. But yet, she was still conscious. The physician called it a miracle. But I felt... If she can't make it after all, Why not give her a peaceful death? Kagami Hospital Kagami Byoin. This is our old hospital's phone number before we relocated here. For emergency call. When did you move? It was 5 months ago. Wasn't she a patient of yours? Her name is Okazaki Yoko. After you called us, I checked our records. There was no record of her admittance for treatment. Kusaka-san, a call from Dr. Sato. Yes. Sorry, I must be going now. Phone calls to this hospital... What kind of meanings are linked to it? Tomorrow... 22:39 PM... APRIL 23RD 22:39 PM Exclusive Coverage! You might witness the shocking moment. Emergency Live Show!

Can this program save her from her fate? APRIL 23RD 22:39 PM EXCLUSIVE LIVE COVERAGE! I'll go to the studio to meet Natsumi. This sound... Here we go. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. This sound... Just before Kenji fell down to the shaft, I heard this sound in an elevator. Asthma patient's body... I thought you could answer my questions. Jobs we received from the Kagami hospital for the past year is... Yellow color of the skin. Entire body is yellowish. Cirrhosis of the Liver. Yellow eyeballs... He must have suffered a lot. Look very carefully. His left leg is swollen. Typical symptom of heart failure. Far from the heart, organs started to die. It is a slow death. Body must suffer. But there is no worry. You lose consciousness. This is not it. It might be a bit too harsh on you... What? What's going on? What's this? Mizunuma Mimiko 10 years old 2002/09/21 Declared death at Kagami Hospital 7 months ago, she died of infantile asthma. (M) Matsuda Yoshimi Matsumura Sensei Mizutani Maki Mizunuma Marie Mitsui Kaoru Miyake Masako. Mizunuma Marie? Eh? It's deceased Mimiko-chan's mother's name. Let me use your phone. Do you know the address of Mizunuma-san? Yes, but... Nobody lives there. Eh? Fatherless Family and such... After funeral, this mother... abruptly... disappeared. We haven't been paid for the funeral costs. Hello? Hello. This is Mizunuma Residence. We can't come to the phone right now. After the beep, please leave your message. Always the same recorded message even on her cell phone. I must tell you this. If you die, you'll be in this database. Hello? Natsumi? Hey, how have you been? Natsumi! Do you know Mizunuma-san? Yeah! What's the problem? We go on air tomorrow. Will you check this? No. If you don't know, it's OK. Natsumi, you shouldn't appear on TV. I'm telling you that Tendo-Sensei's time to be moved up 30 minutes. Have him check the stage set. He's so picky, you know. Is this Psychic Medium really credible? Come on! There is no way we can do that. Can you take the responsibility? Then, Yumi, you'd do something instead? Natsumi... Looks nice. This wardrobe is a bit too bright. I must hung up. Find a bit darker one. Wait! Natsumi. Natsumi! Here. My sister's appointment book. She worked for the Children's Guidance Office. July 18th... Mizunuma Mimiko-chan... Asthma attack July 21 Mizunuma Nanako-chan swallowed thumb tacks. That's Mimiko-chan's sister. Mimiko-chan... Asthma attack July 26th... Mizunuma Nanako-chan. Light burn on her left thigh July 30th... Mizunuma Nanako-chan. Pestiside went into her left eye. Emergency treatments at Kagami Hospital... 9 times! In July only. Hello? I'll come to the office tomorrow. Then, I'll quit. I was just fired. Children's Guidance Office. Mizunuma Marie had been abusing her daughters. Probably... But we could not come to that conclusion on the committee. Why? They came to hospitals so often. Certainly, Nanako-chan's sickness and wounds were frequent. She had never hidden anything. On every occasion, either Marie-san or Mimiko-chan called for help. Besides, doctors and nurses told us... Marie-san was making an exceptional effort to care for Nanako-chan. Even without enough sleep. Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy Dairi Munchausen Shoukougun. How did you know?! Ritsuko-san was suspecting Munchausen syndrome by proxy. By proxy what? Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy Dairi Munchausen Shoukougun. MSBP is a mental disorder in which a person falsely reports or causes symptoms in another healthy person under his or her care. Why? To satisfy one's crave for attention and the limelight. In a word, a caregiver in this case, a good mother, receives attention, sympathy... and appraisal. For such a stupid purpose? Physically harm her own child to produce symptoms? It is often related to the abuser's childhood experience. In fact, when Mimiko-chan went into convulsion. There is a rumor that Marie-san was beside her. But she ignored her. Poor Mimiko-chan... She was a kind child, who took good care of her sister. Eh?! This is very bad. What? Her face was not so visible last time, was it? Police does not and will not... work on a murder crime that has not been committed. Natsumi might be killed today! Is that so? Didn't I tell you? It's useless. What?! If Police had investigated my sister's death 6 months ago properly, there wouldn't be this many victims. Victims? Who are you referring to? Okazaki Yuko, Kawai Kenji - I found the same jawbreakers from their mouth. They are all fucking victims! Pretending to be a detective is fun? Donç¨š get carried away. Do you care for some candies? I'll go to the TV station alone. Eh?! Cancel Cell now. And don't get involved. But Natsumi is in trouble! If you don't want to be alone, go back to your family. My family house... I've never been there since high school graduation. I'm coming, too. Hey! Excuse me... Pardon me... We'll hold a conference time later. No worry. Keep your chin up. Tama-chan! Are you ready? Yes! I'll attach a mic here. Natsumi! Off limits to outsiders. Call the guards! Remove them! Let's go! Yumi! TV doesn't do anything good. One minute to on-air! Hurry up! Excuse me! Pardon me! Make way, please! Natsumi! Natsumi! One minute to on-air! We'll go to Cam â™ª4! One minute to on-air! Cam â™ª2 stand by! Natsumi-san goes into the center stage. Stand by. Wait for my Cue! You stand by right here, OK. First we count 5 and then live on air at 2. Hey, hey, you are in the way! 30 Seconds to on-air! 30 Seconds to on-air! Great place... I discovered lately... Cheap and Yummy. Hello? Kaori-chan? I can't talk to you now. Hey! MC! Respond to me! Attention! 10 seconds to on-air! 5 seconds, counting! Finally the time has come. What will you do if you got warnings of impending death by your own voice through your own Cell phone? Tonight we get together a team to investigate this death-messaging call, that shook our entire country. We go on live with this Emergency Broadcast and you see with your own eyes what this is all about. One co-ed received this death-messaging call. The appointed time is tonight, on this day, April 23rd. At 10:39 PM. It is exactly 38 minutes from now. We brought together Experts in Paranormal Phenomena. Hirayama Masakazu-san, Isobe Akira-san. Furuki Emika-san. Give us your hands, please. Just started! Aren't you watching? Let me know when the Ghost shows up. First let's go to the video tape to recreate what had happened. You don't fit... as a detective. Let's welcome Konishi Natsumi-san who had received this dreadful message. Please come over here. Follow her move! Please come over here. Can you talk? Please be seated. I'll ask you lots of questions that you may or may not be able to immediately answer. First Konishi-san, I'll ask you straight out. I heard that you had lost 2 friends lately. Is it true? Yes. I see... it is true. One thing in common between the two is each Cell phone shows the incoming call from his or her own Cell phone. Recorded Message has a date and time stamped in the future. On the appointed day and time. On the appointed day and time, they died. What a beautiful profile! If it's a prank, it'd cost a lot of work. And this time, Konishi-san's Cell phone received this video images instead of her own voice messages. The Death Warning Count-down timer processing 25:00. Run the Video. I had gone drinking with her several times I must say that I got surprised. Rather shocking I should say... ...within a short period of time, two students from the same school died. The Death Warning Count-down timer processing 19:53. Possibly a distorted human relationships... From psychological point, you might want to say so, but. This is "Paranormal Phenomena." You always talk that way. Less than 15 minutes to the appointed time. 15 seconds to commercial. What is going to happen to her? After commercial, we'll welcome Tendo-sensei, our resident Psychic Medium. Music, Enter! Will she come out alive from the studio? Now we go into commercials. Good! So far, so good! Not good. Not working well. No, you're doing OK. The stage is yours, Tendo Hakusui-Sensei. We need your help more than ever. Tendo Hakusui Psychic Medium. "Nomaku sanmanda bazaradan senda makaroshada sowataya un tarata kanman". Homage to the all-pervading Vajras! O Violent One of great wrath! Destroy! un tarata kan man.

With no categories, this mysterious power saves all beings; suffering goes, happiness comes. I knew... this incident. 5 years ago, at the end of the year, I was suffering a high fever. At that time, Konishi-san, I had already met you. Under the sunshade parasol you were crying. In the purity and clarity of Heaven... In the purity and clarity of this world... I am... alone... In the purity and clarity of... Did you fix this, Kudo-chan? No, I didn't do anything. Aaaaaaahh! No! Stop there! No! Out of my way! Hey! I must get in! Let me in! Gyaaaaaahh! CM! Go to Commercials! No! No commercials! Go on! Roll it! OK, Right?! OK, Right?! Natsumi! Hwaah! Natsumi... Natsumi! I'll take you to the hospital. Waaaaaaaaaahhhh! Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Aaahhhhhhhh... April 23 22:39 PM. Gwaaaahhhh! Gggwaaaa... Nakamura Yumi. You have received (1) new message. The first message is... 24th 19:13 PM. Why? Doushite? Why? Doushite? Nakamura Yumi's Apartment. You'd better take a rest. Call your friend. Have him stay with you. Until then, I'll be with you. How about a drink? Can I open beer or something? Tomorrow... It's useless. It's unavoidable, it just happens. Tomorrow night... Just like Natsumi... Don't give up. 16 hours to go... What do you think I can do? What's that scar? You by any chance... Abused by your parents? By my mother... How about your father? He didn't stop your mother? He was seldom at home... My Granny had always tried to save me. Yumi? Call Granny here. Yes! Granny! I'm sorry. Ouuuuuuu! Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh! Hey! What's up? I'm sorry. What's up? Are you alright? What's up? Hey! Are you alright? I'm sorry. Mizunuma Marie's Apartment. She had just disappeared leaving everything behind. I'm in trouble.

Yes, that's her. Nanako-chan... Nanako-chan, do you know where your mother is? Nanako-chan. Sorry, but... She can't talk. Eh? Not from birth... But from abuse, most likely... Nanako-chan... Your bear is sick again? Any words from her mother? During these 6 months... None at all. This melody... This? Some time ago, It became popular from one of Children's TV program. Where's your Mom? You don't really know?! Sorry. I'm sorry. Do you happen to know where Mizunuma-san is? Well... At that time, unless she was physically working she was practically living in the hospital. She was more knowledgeable about the hospital than the newly recruited nurses. Well then... What is being built on old hospital site? Nothing. It hasn't been torn down - yet, I should say. Eh? Yamashita-san, it's me. I told you to go home. I couldn't sit still. Old Kagami Hospital is still standing there. I'll pay a visit now. W- Wait! Wait... I'll go. What's the address? I got it. You stay in the room. But! T... Time is pressed. But I will come to see you. Do you understand? Then, see you. Thank you very much. Thank you. April 24 18:49 PM. Old Kagami Hospital Ruin.

April 24 19:13 PM. It's over. Everything is alright now. Probably... it's Mizunuma Marie's corpse. You'd better not look. She wanted to be found by someone... Gwaaaaaaaaahh! Yumi! Yumi! Yumi! Yumi! Brother! Ritsuko... Brother... There are various skies to every one. Mother... I won't run away from you. I'll be a good girl... I'll stay with you forever.

The one who has been harming you... ...was not your Mother... ...but your sister... Tell me... But my sister always popped a jawbreaker into my mouth. "I hope you'll recover soon", she said. Mom! I can't breathe. Mom! I can't breathe. The one who'd killed "Ritsuko and Natsumi" is not "Marie!" It's Mimiko! Eh?! W... What do you mean?! Probably "Marie" is the first victim. The deceased Mimiko accessed. Marie's Cell phone. W... Wait a minute! Then... I've been trying calling... but I can't connect to Yumi. Send someone immediately! Yumi! Yumi! Yamashita-san? It's me!
