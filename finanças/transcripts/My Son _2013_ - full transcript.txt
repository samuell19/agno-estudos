(light music) - [Bo] Hey, you wanna play a game with me? - [Cadon] Yeah, what kind of game? - [Bo] All right, what were gonna do is every time I see someone wearing black, I get to punch you. Every time you see someone wearing orange you get to punch me. - [Cadon] How come you get to pick the colors? - [Bo] 'Cause I made the game? - [Cadon] I don't think that's fair. - Black! - [Cadon] I didn't see anybody. - You didn't have to see him, I saw him. - Can I please pick a different color? - Nope, orange. - Hey, what girl you think I could keep? - Man, leave him alone. Why do you do that stupid hand thing? - I don't know, it was just something my dad used to do. - Okay, boys, listen to me for a second. Cadon, today is very important to me and I don't want you misbehaving. Guys, please stop. Bo, Dylan, you know what your parents expect of you. Don't make me have to call them. - Yes ma'am. - Our god is rich in mercy and grace. He loves us with an everlasting love. And his word gives us a small peek in the vastness of his love. - Scoot over, you. Scoot over! - He proves this. Listen to what Scripture says in Romans 5:8 That God demonstrates his own love-- - I'm hungry. - Shh! - I was talking to you. I don't want this. - Can they be any louder? - See God didn't just say get your act together and then come to me. - The game is still on. - No, I think I misheard you. - Orange! - Stop. - Shh. - Shh! - You see sin has left us hopeless and helpless. So God sent Jesus to be our savior to die on the cross for us. To save us from our sins. - I don't want this. - He's God's greatest gift to us. - This is boring. - [Pastor] And maybe this morning you feel broken. - Feet stay on the ground. - [Bo] I'm comfortable. - To be encouraged that God, Jesus, is the great potter who can take the pieces of your life to put them back together and make you whole again. If you feel lost, you're wandering through your life, Jesus is a great shepherd who seeks you out. Maybe you feel lost and you can't find your way. He's the light. - This is not working. Come on boys, we got to go, hurry. - It's all your fault. - Life is specialty. (tense music) - What just happened? Why did we just get kicked out? - Bo, come on! - No, why do we have to leave? - Come get in the car! - No! I thought God was supposed to be nice. (clanking) - [Woman On Radio] SN to all units be in route to 13201 Farm Road 10. Active shooter, possible hostage situation. - Breaking news this evening of a church shooting in Rangeview County. We have reporters on the scene. - [Reporter] It's about a block away right now but we believe there may even be an active shooter still in the building. - We're on the scene of a deadly church shooting about eight miles outside of Rangeview. - At what is being called a church massacre. - Now this church building is located in a very remote area adding to a great deal of confusion. - We do know that crime scene investigators are still inside collecting evidence and forensics. - We've seen bodies actually being carried from the building. - The Sheriff's department tells us that they've recovered a military style assault rifle from the scene. - We also know that there are several people in custody at this point in time but they have not released their names. A press conference with Sheriff Jerry Winters is expected sometime this evening. - New details are emerging this afternoon about the events that took place yesterday. - While the motives remain uncertain, we did talk to one witness who was here at the church at the time of the shooting. She believes that a domestic dispute may be involved. - I'm just thankful it's over. - A place where people come to worship, where they come for healing, comfort and to feel safe has now become a target. - We're shocked and really hurting. - We're still learning more information from the Sheriff's department concerning the deadly shooting that happened here yesterday. - Even here a day later, police officials have still not released the identities of the victims. - They've started a memorial in honor of those that they've lost, bringing teddy bears, flowers and signs. - This is just a tragic event that has befallen this community. The Sheriff's office has been in and out of the courthouse this morning. - While many questions still remain unanswered, the one question that's on everyone's mind is how does something like this happen? - You gotta tell me man, what is all this? - All this? This is my family. - Family? - Mhmm. - You went off and got married and didn't tell me? - No. No, nothing like that. I met her a while back at a party and things have been going really good ever since. - Yeah, until you knocked her up. - No, man I didn't knock her up. She already had Austin. But man I love him like he was my own. - I don't know man, I mean that just seems like a lot of baggage to me just for a chick. - And it would be if she was just a chick but she's more than that. She's real special. - Yeah well, she's special where it counts, I'll give you that much. What happened to this whole engineer degree? I mean isn't that why you came out here in the first place? - Yeah I did, and I was going to school for a little while. - Then she got in the way? - No, she didn't get in the way. Life just had something else in store for me. I may not have the same kind of money that I'd have if I was an engineer, but, - What do you mean, you're broke? - No, I'm not broke. - No, come on man, level with me. I mean you got a kid and a chick now so they're expensive. - No, we're good, really. We're all right. We just kind of take it day to day. Wait, no man, come on. - [Bo] Take it, man, come on. Just take it. - All right, but I'm gonna pay you back. - Don't even worry about it, man. - Bo, you always been like a brother to me. - [Bo] That's what I'm here for, man - [Cadon] Thanks man. - I'm happy for you though. I'm glad you found what you were looking for. It's good to meet you, Jess. - [Jess] Wanna play it again? Did I get you? - Hey, little man, what's happening? How are you doing? What did you think of your Uncle Bo? - What is that? - Huh, what did you think of him? - He wants to play on the swing. I think he's addicted to the swings. - [Cadon] So, what'd you think? - About Bo? - [Cadon] Yeah. - Um, he didn't stay long, so, I don't know, I thought he was a little creepy actually. - Creepy? - Yes, actually. - Really? Well, creepy Uncle Bo just gave us a hundred bucks. - Well. Well he's not that creepy then. - [Cadon] Well I guess he ain't. - How about that? - Mhmm. - [Alan] Sherry, thank you so much for dinner. This was delicious. - You are so welcome. - [James] Yeah honey it was great. - [Alan] James, you sure do have a good deal here. - Thank you, appreciate it. - Great family, great family. - Speaking of family, I need to talk to you about Jess. - Yeah. - She was here about six months ago with Austin. Stormed out, mad. Since then we haven't seen or heard from her. We don't know what's going on. We don't know where she's living. We don't know anything. - I'm sorry to hear that. What are you thinking? - We're just worried sick. We just wanna know what's going on with them. - What's really bothering me is she's bouncing from house to house and that is no way for a little boy to live. He needs routine. Matter of fact, the past few times we've seen him he's been only in a diaper. And nothing breaks my heart more than worrying about my grandson. - Well, is she still on probation? - I believe so. It's gonna be up in two years which would have been about July, no. - August. - Is there any chance that she'd be willing to bring him and live here? I mean this is a nice place. - Honestly, Alan, we have prayed for something like that for so long. But I just don't see it happening. - So are you guys telling me that you're wanting to file for custody? - We're willing to do whatever it takes. We just want to know that they're okay. - Well, what you're asking for is possible but it's very difficult in the state. - Yeah but if we could get Austin here, then Jess can get on her feet and we'll be able to help her. - You two are really good friends. I've known you a long time. And I've seen cases like this in the past and I need to tell you that if we go this route you have to prepare for things to get ugly. - Okay last time. Just one more time, okay? - Jess, you said that the last time. Where's that money that Bo gave us anyway? - Austin needs stuff. Kids, they need more than you think and money goes fast. - Oh it goes fast all right. $60 pair of jeans? - Excuse me, you know they were not $60 jeans first of all. And second of all, I'm not gonna let my kid run around in garage sale crap all the time. - Look, I'm not trying to start a fight. You just know how much I hate doing this. - I don't like it either. Let's just go, get it over with. (tense music) - Where's your restroom? He needs a changee. - [Cadon] Just this. (beeping) - [Cashier] Still not working. Do you have another card? - Yeah. (beeping) - Thank you. - Hey, I just got gas. Can I just go ahead and pay? - I'm sorry. It's probably their machine. This'll just take a second. Try that one. - No cash? - I don't think that's gonna help very much. You know what, don't worry about it. I appreciate it. Have a good night, okay, thank you. Never again. - I know, I know. Let's just go. (light music) - All right, well that takes care of everything. If I can just get you to sign here on the service call I can get out of your way. - I'm not signing anything. You didn't fix anything. - Well I did everything that was on the list. - I don't care about your list. You can shove your list. I want this TV working. Now! - With all due respect, I've done everything that's on this invoice that the company wrote down for me to do. - I don't care. I don't have a system that works. I ask you to come out and fix it and you didn't do anything. You changed a couple connectors. - If you don't sign this list, I can't get paid. - No, I'm not signing anything. It's not my problem. Your problem is to fix this system and it's not working. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Jess] Hey, Jenn, it's Jess. - Oh my gosh, Jess, how are you? Where have you been? How's Austin? - We're fine, he's fine. But listen, I need to ask a favor. - [Jenn] Yeah, what's up? - We kind of hit a rough spot this last month and I was hoping maybe you could send us some money, you know to get us by? - Yeah for sure, let me go ask mom and dad. - [Jess] No, no don't say anything to them. I don't want them to worry. - Okay, what do you want me to do? - I was hoping you could mail me, you know, like 300 dollars. - Jess, I don't have 300 dollars. - Couldn't you just make up something to mom and dad, you know, to get it out of them or something? - Well I'm not gonna lie to them but I think I can still get it. This money's for you and Austin, right? - Yeah, yes yes of course. Here, I'll give you the address. - Um yeah, let me get a pen. (metal music) - Hey, put your stuff in the back. Damn dude, look at you. You need to get a haircut, bro. - Yeah I know. - [Bo] So how's everything in there? - Everything's fine. Dad stopped drinking anyways. - (scoffs) Yeah dude. You know how many times I've heard that every single day of my life, dad's stopped drinking. He ain't ever gonna change, man, he's a liar. - Yeah well things have seriously changed now. - Whatever, man. Look, anytime that you need a place to stay you know where to come. - But I thought Cadon was living with you. - No. He's all chasing some piece of tail. What about you, you got a girl yet? - No. - Good. (somber music) - [Jess] Morning. - Hey, good morning. - [Jess] How are you? - [Cadon] Good, how'd you sleep? - Okay. - Little boy. Tired little boy. - You hungry? - Mhmm. - Okay. (water splashing) Are you playing? I don't think water's gonna help that piece of junk, hon. - Huh? (gasping) - Oh he's getting us, ah! Stop, stop. (light music) Let's get him, ah, let's get him, come on come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go. - You stay, hey hey hey, you stay over there. - We're gonna go get him. Should we get him? - Are they gone? Is anybody out there? I think they ran away. Hmm, I don't see anybody. I think I'm good. Ooh, oh oh! I surrender, I surrender! (laughing) Oh man. Oh goodness. Oh man. - [Jess] You picked the wrong fight, mister. - I know that's right. I was just no match for the two of you. - Obviously, obviously. (laughs) - You know Jess, I think about how this car really is all beat up and I know you deserve better, you and Austin. I just wish, sometimes I wish I could get you a new one. - You're being silly. We don't need that. You have given more to us than anybody else has. I mean you're letting us live here. You're gonna watch Austin while I'm trying to work, and, you mean more to us than anybody. And we don't need a new car. We need you. - I don't know about all that. But even if half of what you're saying is true it doesn't even start to compare to how much you and Austin mean to me. You guys are everything to me. - You know life will get better. - Mhmm. - I mean I don't need money to make me happy. We don't need money, right? - No. - And money doesn't make me a better mom. And that's all that matters to me right now. Austin is everything. - You are an awesome mom. Anybody who's been around you for five minutes-- - You're just saying that. - No, it's how awesome you are. They know how much you love him. - You're being too nice. You're nice all the time. - Well you make it easy, mhmm. Yes you do. - 'Cause everybody else seems to focus on all the mistakes I've made. - I think you're the only one who focuses on that stuff. - Okay. - That's what I think. - You're trying to start another fight is what you're doing. - Maybe. - I'll get the hose. Austin's ready. - What? What? - We'll take you on. - Girl I'm the hose master. - Not kidding, are you? Are you? - You better get two hoses. - We can't afford two hoses. - Ooh man! Aw, she hit me with the low blow. Ref, we got a flag on the field, flag. - Look. We had a lot of applicants more qualified than you. And man, there are a lot of people here, they wouldn't be comfortable with this arrangement. - I understand that. - But I know you. And I feel like this is something that I need to do. So there you go. - Thank you. - All right. - Thank you very much. Really appreciate it, next week right? - Next week. - I love it. Thanks a lot, man. Passion. - You know James, today was ridiculous. - What? I thought it was a great game. - It was a great game. I'm talking about that pasture that we had to play on today. We pay top dollar for our kids to have a good field and they play on that thing? - Honey, it really wasn't that bad. - It wasn't that bad? Were you at the same game I was at? Our daughter's way too good to play on a team in a field like that. - You know, to be honest, I am so tired of Emily. It's like she's such a ball hog. I don't even know how she's still on this team. - Well I think we all played well. - We? No offense, Jenn but don't you have to play every once in a while to be considered part of the team? - If we have a game like that next week, I'm gonna pull her out. She's not gonna play. We'll see how the coach likes that one. - Jerry! - What's up, boys? What's going on, Karl? - How are you, Jerry? - [Jerry] Good, James. - [James] What's going on? - Not much. Ladies, kids. Oh, soccer game today? - Yeah. They did great. - Shawna scored three goals. Best player on the team. - Oh, Shawna. Well hey, good seeing y'all. Enjoy your day. - See you. - You too. - Bye, Sheriff. (clanking) - Dang it! (sighs) - Hey, how's it going? - [Cadon] Oh, it's been better. - Yeah? - You don't happen to be a mechanic, are you? - Can't say I am, sorry. You're out of luck. Hey, I just put Austin to bed and I was wondering if you wanted to come inside for a few minutes? What do you think? - I think there is nothing on this planet I would rather do than come inside with you. But I have got to finish this car. If I don't get this done, then I can't do the calls. And if I don't take my calls then I can't, I can't pay the rent, I can't do anything. But let me get a raincheck. - Okay. (laughs) All right, well I'm gonna be inside then, okay? Right in there. Okay, good luck. - I'm gonna need it! - [James] What are you doing? - Nothing, just piddling. Actually, I've been writing letters to Austin. I'm hoping someday this will all make sense to him. - You know Alan called me yesterday at the office. - You didn't tell me that. - There really wasn't much to say. He said he thought something would be happening soon. - What does that mean? - I don't know. He was in a hurry to get to court and that's all he said. - Hello Stashawn, this is your dad calling. I just wanted to call to see what might have happened tonight and why you couldn't make it. It's okay that you didn't. I understand things happen and that's all right. And I just really want to talk to you and see you because there are some things that I can't say over the phone. And I just need to find out what's going on with you and let you know what's happening with me in my life. Be blessed, tell mom and Kiera that I said hello and I love them, I love you and I hope to talk to you soon. Love you again, take care, bye bye. - So you're telling me that I drive all the way out here just to connect a loose sensor? - What's the sensor do? - Are you kidding me? You know maybe instead of playing daddy in there day in and day out, you should sack up and take an interest in your vehicle like a man. - I did take a interest in my vehicle. But those two that are in there, they really need me right now. So they're at the top of my list. - Yeah but what about what you need? I mean dude, there are so many women out there. The best part is, there are no strings attached. - Actually, I kind of like her strings. - But don't you ever get tired of the same thing-- - Hey, how's it going in here? - Hey, what's up? We are just finishing up right now. - Wow, that was quick. - [Cadon] Mhmm, yeah we're on it. - Cool. Did you ask him? - Ask me what? - Well Cadon's birthday is coming up and we talked about inviting you to come celebrate with us. - No, he didn't say a thing to me. - Yeah we were thinking about having like a party or something. - Yeah, daddy needs to loosen up a little bit. - I can agree with you on that one. - Yeah, I mean you guys got a good place here. You know, we could have a few friends over, have some drinks. - I was thinking like low key. - No, Jess, seriously, I got this. Don't even worry about it. I'll take care of everything. - All right, but nothing crazy. You gotta keep it under control. - You got it man, we'll keep it low key. Trust me. (hip hop music) (crowd chattering) What's going on man, you having a good time? - Bo, I don't know any of these people. Who are they? - Oh dude, you just gotta loosen up a little bit. Go mingle some, live a little. Hey everyone, listen up. Let's have a drink on the birthday boy! (cheering) (retching) (Austin crying) - [Jess] I know, mommy knows, I'm sorry. (mumbling) Here, here. - When will this party be over? I can hear the music from my house. - But this party just started, lady! Huh, yeah? - Young man, I will not hesitate to call the police. - Whoah, whoah, whoah, hold on. What's going on here? - [Neighbor] Is Jessica here? - Dude I really hope that's not the stripper. (laughs) (chattering) - [Man] Look at your robe. (laughing) - Hey. Seriously? - Why are you so wet? - Bo's little girlfriend decided to spill a little beer on me so now I'm drenched. Do you know that there are people having sex in our bedroom, Cadon? Yeah. - I'm sorry. It's not my fault though. You know I don't know these people. - I know, and I'm not mad. I'm really not mad. But I just put our son down and he's trying to sleep and he can't. So you need to go and get them out, okay? Sorry. - I'm gonna go talk to Bo but don't be mad at him. I mean this is just Bo being Bo. - I'm not mad. (doorbell ringing) Can I help you? - I'm here to perform my child welfare check on Austin. Are you Jessica Clark? - Yeah, I'm his mother. You know, actually this is a really bad time for both of us, I'm sorry. - Well this is a good time for me. - Is there a way you could come back later today? - I'm sorry, this is not an option. - Okay. What exactly is going on here? - I was gonna ask you the same question. - So I see here that you are currently on probation for possession of a controlled substance, is that correct? - Yes sir. - [Judge] Are you clean now? - Yes, sir. Yes, I've never done drugs, sir. I had someone riding with me in high school that had been. - I see. Now this report I'm reading, it doesn't look good, Miss Clark. - No sir. - Can you explain some of this to me? - Is that the report about leaving Austin in the car or the welfare lady? - Oh, tell me about both. - Okay. With the car, Austin had just fallen asleep and I went inside about 20 seconds to pay for gas. I made sure that I-- - Miss Clark. You left your child unattended in a car. That in itself is enough grounds to remove him from your custody. Do you understand that? - I realize that, but it was just 20... Yes sir. - Alan. Do you or your client have anything to share? - [Alan] No, your honor. - Well I think I've heard enough. Miss Clark, you've been unable to show me adequate proof of stable income. This letter from your probation officer is littered with concerns. And this report from CWS says there was drug paraphernalia in your home and someone passed out that you couldn't even identify. Miss Clark, I am seriously concerned about the welfare and safety of your son. It is the order of this court that full parental custody in this case be granted to Mr. And Mrs. James Clark. - Sir, sir, I'd really like to explain. - Miss Clark, we're done here. (somber music) (Austin crying) - Hey, has Jess come out the courthouse? - Yeah she's right out there on the bench. - Do we need to go talk to her? - I really don't think she wants to talk to either one of us right now. - Well what if I go talk to her? - Yeah you could tell her she can come see him anytime she wants and she could stay as long as she wants. - Okay. (somber piano music) Jess. I'm so sorry. - How could they do that to me? - They really do love you. - Austin usually needs a nap around three pretty much everyday, and if he doesn't get one you know what that means, so. And when you lay him down at night it needs to be completely quiet and it takes about 30 minutes, you know, to settle him down because usually he's not, you know how hyper he always is. Milk helps. But he needs a night light because he's scared of the dark. And if he cries, he usually does around like one he wakes up sometimes. If he cries, just make sure somebody goes in there and like rocks him 'cause he'll just keep crying and keep crying and the next day he'll just be, he'll be a mess. He needs his sleep, so if you could just make sure. - Jess. He's gonna be okay. (somber music) - [Jess] Hey, what are you doing here? - Hey. I don't have another call until three so I came over to eat. - Oh okay. Hey, I have one of your work shirts. You have any others that I need to wash? - No, they're all clean right now. How you doing, how you feel? - I'm okay. I'll be all right. Feel like I'm in a dream and it didn't really happen. - I was looking through these court papers and it says that after 12 months they're gonna review it. And if you got a job and a place to live there's a good chance we're gonna get him back. And it also says that if you were married that that could make it look a lot better, like a stable family. And another good thing is that you got the visitation rights every weekend and they can't take that away from you no matter what your parents say. - I don't think I can do that right now. Seems like a little much. I don't really think I can look at them at this point, you know? - Just give it some time and see how you feel. Maybe things will be better this weekend. - Maybe. We'll see. - Want some bites, yeah? You're being such a big boy. - Hey Jenn, I wouldn't give him too many bites before dinner. It'll ruin his appetite. Hey James, don't go far, dinner's about ready. - All right. - Mom, I know we're supposed to be happy right now but I just can't help but think how Jess is handling all this. - I've been thinking about her a lot too. I know what we're doing is right. I just don't know if it's best. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - James? What do you think? - I don't know. I just want some closure. I mean I thought this would be it but we still don't have Jess back. - So what are we supposed to do now? - Guess we'll just have to keep trust in God. - Sometimes that's easier said than done. - That's right. (somber music) - Hey. You just wake up? - No. - What are you doing? - I'm sitting. What are these doing out, Cadon? - Jess. What are you doing, come on. Stop. - He's not coming home, Cadon. He's not, and you know that. - You gotta believe he's coming back, Jess. You can't give up. - I'm not giving up, I'm letting go. (sobbing) - How many calls do you have today? - I had four, but three of them canceled. - That's not good. - Mmm-mmm. You look nice this morning. Hey lady, my friends say you look nice. I know I'm short, but do you hear me? - Cadon. Just stop. - So how's mom, how's Kiera, how's everything? - They're fine. - That's good, I'm glad. I'm glad everything is great. It's really good to see my daughter. I'm glad you're here. I need you to know that I am committed to fixing this family. - Dad. You do know it's gonna be a while before any of us can trust you. - I do, I know that. I just want the opportunity to show that I've changed. - We've heard this before, dad. - I know you've heard this, I know, I'm aware of it, but God has made some amazingly wonderful things happen in my life. In fact, he's opened doors of which I have a job. - You have a job? Where? - Working at a church. - A church? - Yeah, a church. - [Daughter] What are you doing at a church? - Environmental services specialist, bother. - So you're a janitor. - Yeah, yeah your dad's a janitor. But it's a good thing. It's really wonderful. And I have to go speak Wednesday, next Wednesday and I would really love it if you and mom and Kiera could all come down and really witness what I have to say. - I don't know, dad. Maybe. - That's good enough for me. (creaking) - Jess, I'm home. Hey Jess. Sweetheart. (somber music) - So still Friday, it's fine with me, let me know. I'll give you a call. - I hate this place. - Shawna, what are you talking about? - There's not any service. - There are more important things than your phone. - Whatever, mom. - Good evening, good evening everybody. - [Crowd] Good evening. - You'll be glad you came tonight. We are so blessed to have with us this evening someone whose story proves that Jesus is still in the business of changing lives, amen? So I wanna invite you to help me to welcome him to the stage right now. Andrew, would you come on up, and share your question. (crowd applauding) - I thought we hired this guy to clean toilets. - Him and I have talked. This is gonna be good. - Well I hope he uses words and not gang signs. - First off, if it wasn't for Christ, in my life I would never be standing in this room in front of you all tonight. I surely won't be in the same room with the Sheriff and the preacher. Unless the room had bars on it. (laughs) I know that sounds funny but it's true. Really though, spending seven years in a prison cell, I had a big revelation. I realized that only one person could fix the mess that my life had become. And that person wasn't me. (baby crying) - Hey. What's wrong? Shh, shh. Shh. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay sweety, it's okay. Oh sweet baby. You miss your mommy, don't you? I miss your mom too. (somber music) (doorbell ringing) Oh I got it. Jess, hey. It's good to see you. Are you hungry? We just fixed something to eat. - I'm just here to see Austin. - Okay, he's in there with your dad. - Hey little guy. I missed you. Oh I missed you. Oh it's so good to see you. Come here, give mommy a hug. Give mommy a big hug. I missed you. Can I have some alone time with my son? - [James] Sure. Let's go in here, let Jess have some time with Austin. - You're so big and tall. Oh, mommy missed you. - I can't believe she's here. - I know, but you've got to go talk to her. - I can't. I don't know what to say. - Yes you do, do the dad thing. Ask where she's living. Does she have a job? - Why don't you go talk to her? - No. - What you got here? A tractor? Oh you got a choo choo somewhere? (tense music) - Did you see the way she looked at me? - You're imagining all that. - I am not. We have got to bring Jess home. - I'll try. - Go, you can do this. - My goodness, you're busy. Where's Mr. Baba? What you got there? - Well we've been letting him have a sippy cup here lately and he's been going to the playgroup. And he's been going to church with us every Sunday. - Oh yeah. I bet he's potty trained and he knows his ABCs too. - Come on Jess. We just wanna work things out. Hey, how about you and your guy friend come over here for dinner and we can talk-- - You don't even know his name do you? - Jess. - Really, really. - Jess look, we just want what's best for you and Austin. - Is that what you want really? Did you want that at the court hearing? - Jess. - 'Cause I don't think so. Because what I remember is that you were quiet. You didn't say a single thing. - Jess. - And you know, you sat there and watched it all and was silent. Mom got everything she wanted. - That is not fair, Jessica. - Don't even. I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry right now. - Jess, Jess. Jess, you can't take him. - [Jess] Get out of the way. - You cannot take him. Austin, come here. You cannot take him. - I knew this was a bad idea. I am a good mom. I am a great mom and you don't even know. You don't know me. All you do is focus on the past. All the stupid things that I've done, you don't even know who I am anymore! You know what, you are ruining my life. Is that what you want? Does that make you happy? I hope it does 'cause that's exactly what you're doing. - Jess, Jess! Jess! Jess, stop. Jess. - What? - What happened? - What happened, are you serious? Jenn, they took away my baby, my son. I haven't seen him for six weeks and I come to visit him and they just keep rubbing it in my face about how great they are and how bad I am, I can't. - They're not trying to rub anything in your face. They just want what's best for Austin. Why are you acting like this? - Maybe you'll understand someday when you're a mom. - Jess, I've looked up to you my entire life. And honestly, I don't know what's gotten into you. You're a completely different person. - I don't know. Maybe I am different now. Maybe that's what it is. - See, it's comments like that. What's gotten into you? - Let's see. I got pregnant when I was 17 years old. Maybe it was that. Or my parents disowned me and I couldn't even finish high school. All my friends are losers and to top it off, I lost the only thing that ever mattered to me. They took him away. Gee, I can't imagine why I might be a little bit different, Jenn. - Jess, I know all of that. I just don't understand why you keep making it harder on yourself. You just keep running away. - What do you suggest I do then? - Have you thought about asking for forgiveness? - Are you serious? There is no way in hell that I'd ever go in there and ask those people for forgiveness. No, no. - Jess, I'm not talking about mom and dad. - I wish it was that easy, I really do. It's not. I gotta go. - [Cadon] Hey, how'd it go? - Not well, obviously since Austin's not with me. I drove two hours there, two hours back and I had five minutes with Austin, that was it. And I left. I don't know what happened, I just, - Whoah, start from the beginning. Tell me what went on. - It doesn't matter what went on, Cadon. I don't even know why I'm here. I don't know why I came back. I don't know why I live here. And whatever this is, I don't know anymore. I don't know anything. - What are you saying? What do you mean you don't know why you came back? - Cadon, if I hadn't have met you then Austin would be with me and none of this mess would have happened. And that's true. - How can you say that? We're a family! I love you, I support you, I stand behind you. And more importantly, you know what, I love Austin too. - Cadon, you didn't do anything. I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming Bo who decided to throw a raging party and thinks alcohol, and don't touch me. Cadon, you don't get it. And I know you're trying and I know you're trying but you don't. I can't breathe. Do you know what that's like when you can't even wake up in the morning because you have this giant emptiness that's sitting on your chest? And I don't want to do that anymore. I don't wanna be here. And I don't know how you expect me to sit here and soak it in anymore because I can't. And I don't want to. - Wait, don't walk away. - Don't! - What are you saying you don't wanna be here anymore? You're all I got! You talking about leaving? This is just temporary. Okay if you think for one minute that I'm gonna wait 11 months for them folks to make a decision on our lives, I'm not. He's coming home, Jess. He's coming home soon. Do you believe me? Well you believe this. Tomorrow, I'm walking out that door and I'm finding a way to get our son back. (gun firing) - Cadon, what are you doing out here? - I went by the shop. They said I could find you out here. - Yeah, that's where I'm usually at. You wanna give it a shot? - No, Bo, listen. I didn't come out here today to shoot. We gotta talk. - All right, so this is probably about what happened at the party then. - No, Bo, listen. This really ain't about that. It's about Jess, man. She just, she's falling apart, man. She's a mess. I don't know what to do. - Who says you have to do anything? You could just walk away right now. - Man, you don't understand. Jess is all I've got. Austin's gone, man, he was my everything. I don't know if I'm supposed to call some attorney or... I don't know what to do. - Hold on, hold on. Hold on one second. So you're telling me that the government came into your house, took your son, messed up your home, messed up your family, messed up your girl and you're talking about getting some pretty boy attorney? - What am I supposed to do? - I'm not telling you what to do, but if it was me, if I were in your shoes right now, I would go take my son back. - What are you saying, I should go kidnap my son? - Just listen to what you just said. How are you gonna kidnap something that's yours in the first place? They're the ones that went and kidnapped your son. - What do you suggest? (somber music) Hey baby, we gotta talk. - What is he doing here? He needs to leave. - He came by to help. - No, that's funny that you say help because I remember the last time he decided he needed to help us and what happened with this family so you need to go. - All right Jess, look. No, listen to me. - You need to go. - I'm sorry, okay? I know I screwed up. And that's why I'm here. I'm here to try and help you guys out. I wanna make this right. So please, hear me out. - Please sweety, look. It's just two minutes. Just hear him out, that's all we're doing. We're just talking. Please, two minutes? Please come sit down. - Me and Cadon have been talking and we both agreed that going through the courts is just not the way to handle this. I mean you could spend years in there and never see your son again. So what I'm saying we do is we go get in the car right now and we go take your son. - [Cadon] We just go get him. - No. No, this is stupid. You both sound completely ridiculous right now. Really Bo? - Hold on, all we're doing is talking. It could work, okay? Right now we've got nothing else to work with. Please just listen. Please, come on. - Whatever. - Look, I'm serious, Jess. Just work with me here. Where's he staying at right now? - My parents. - Yeah, okay so if you just give me some time, I can put a plan together and we can make this work. We can get your son back. - Is it just me? I mean am I the only person that thinks this sounds completely crazy? - Jessica, I know this sounds crazy. But right now, crazy might just be the best option. We gotta do something. I miss him. Baby, I miss you. I want our family back. Please baby, we gotta get our son back. We gotta do something. Please, do it for me, please. - All right. All right. What do you need to know? (light rock music) - Let's go ladies, stretch it up. I need you guys loose today. Shawna, get loose get loose. Jenn, get loose. - Come on girls, let's get loose! - Can I have a snack under the bag? - No, honey, dad's gonna take us out to eat after the game. - [Karl] Hey Roger. - [Roger] How you doing? - [Karl] How are you, brother? - We've got this. Jenn, you're gonna start off on the sidelines but I'm gonna get everybody in today, all right? - [Sherry] You think Jenn's gonna play today? - I hope so. - Shawna. Get your head in the game today, okay? - [Shawna] Okay. - Stay in the game, stay focused and intimidate those girls. - I'm glad my dad's not like that. - Nope. - [Shawna] Bye dad. (crowd cheering) - Let's go, Shawna! Come on Shawna, let's go! - Go to space, go to space. Move it over, polygon position, let's go! - Come on Shawna, team leader! - Woo! - All right! - Good job Shawna, keep it up! - Watch the trap! Watch the trap coming on the other side! (whistle blowing) (crowd booing) - What just happened? - Shawna! You're out! Come on, come on, you're out. Jenn, you're in, you're in. Come on Shawna, get off the field. - You're gonna put her in? - Come on! Sit down! Sit down! - This is so stupid! - Come on in. - I started, this is stupid! Are you kidding me? This is dumb! - What?! What are you doing?! You don't pull her out of the game! Shawna, get back in there! Put her back in the game! - Karl! - Pull my girl, what are you doing?! - Ho, ho. - You're not our coach! That's ridiculous, pull her out of the game! - What is he doing? - She's the best player on your team! - Hey let's go girls, get focused, get refocused on this. - Do me a favor and just cool off. I don't need you out here going after the coach. (crowd cheering) - [Bo] This is it. (metal music) - At church? You wanna do this here, really? - Yeah, why? - That's kind of messed up. - No man. What's messed up is the lies that they tell in that place. I mean they hoard people in, brainwash them and all they want is their money. Besides, it's a soft target. - All right, so say we go in there and we get Austin, what happens then? I mean where am I supposed to go? People are gonna be looking for me. - I know some people that can help you out. As long as you're careful and stay under the radar, you'll be fine. - Hey! - What? - [Karl] What are you wearing? - I'm wearing clothes. Katie's waiting for me. - You are not leaving this house dressed like that. - It took me an hour to get ready, dad. - I don't care if you took two hours. You're not leaving this house dressed like a prostitute. - Really dad? That's what you're gonna call me? - Well if the shoe fits. - Karl, what's the big deal? - She's half naked! - I think it looks cute. - It doesn't look cute. Is this my family now? - Really dad? I saw what you were watching last night. - You shut your mouth! - Mom, I'm leaving. - Shawna, you get back here! Shawna! - Karl, calm down. - She has no respect for me. - I wonder why. - Now if we do this right we can be in and out within 45 seconds. Jess they already know you so you're out. You're gonna be in the car the whole time. It's gonna be me, you and Dylan. - Wait, you're gonna bring your little brother in on this? - Yeah he loves this kind of stuff, don't worry about it. We have three objectives. We need to get Austin, we need to create a diversion and we cut the phone lines so that we can have a little head start. Since Austin knows you, you're gonna be the one that grabs him. Dylan's gonna take care of the phone lines and I'm gonna take care of the diversion. - Okay, you keep saying diversion. What do you plan on doing? - Just cause a little commotion, nothing big. - What kind of commotion? - Just don't worry about it, man, it's not a big deal. All right, the best time to go is Sunday around four o'clock. That's whenever your parents are gonna be there, the door's will be unlocked, and, - Are you all ready for dessert? - Just the check, sweet cheeks. So can y'all be ready by Sunday? - Yeah we'll be ready. - Just so you both know, I do not like this idea. And I mean I know we're gonna do it but if anybody gets hurt or anything happens to anybody, I'm not gonna be able to forgive you. I won't, I promise. - Can we get that check? - [Waitress] Thanks. - [Bo] Don't worry about it man, I got it. - [Cadon] You sure? - Yeah, don't worry about it. - Bo, you've always been there for me, always. - Just be ready for Sunday, okay? - [Cadon] I'ma be ready. - Hey. - Hmm. - It's gonna be bizarre going back there tomorrow. Have you ever been to church? - Yeah, I went a couple times when I was little. I really didn't like it so I quit going. - I used to go to church all the time. Every Sunday since I was born. - [Cadon] So what, you one of those religious people? - Yeah, I guess you could say religious. What about you, do you believe in God? - I believe in God. I mean I believe there's a God out there. But I only think about it that much. God's god and we're just people. - Yeah. Seems kind of silly, doesn't it, the whole religion thing. - [Cadon] Yeah. ♪ All creatures of our God in need ♪ ♪ Lift up your voices in witnessing ♪ ♪ Oh praise him ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ The burning sun with golden leaves ♪ ♪ The silver moon with softer breeze ♪ ♪ Oh praise him ♪ ♪ Oh praise him ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ (tense music) ♪ Thou rushing wind that art so strong ♪ ♪ Leave us a-sailing in the long ♪ ♪ Oh praise him ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Praise praise the father, praise the son ♪ ♪ And praise the spirit bring one ♪ ♪ Oh praise him ♪ ♪ Oh praise him ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ (tense music) - No, no. There are too many people here today. No, we're not doing this. Not today. - Jess, you know exactly how many people were gonna be in here. Stick to the plan. - Did Jerry know to be here at four o'clock today? - He told me this morning he'd be here. Sheriffs make their own hours. - I thought we hired our new janitor to do stuff like this. - I told him we can handle this. - It's be nice if we had some wire strippers. - Fellas, really glad you guys came out to help me with this here. Would have taken me all day, man. Thank you much. How's it going out there. Do you need anything? - If we had the right tools, work could be through with this real quick. - Plenty of tools in the maintenance closet. Let me go pick those up. Be right back, all right? Thank you guys, really appreciate it. - And under the ground, the beets run red, and the carrots grew yellow and the potato sprouts grew bigger. - Jenn, do you mind changing him? He stinks. - Can you please help me out? Like why are you even in here? - My mom made me come in here and it's your nephew. (whirring) - How's Jessica doing? She's such a sweetheart. - We got to see her the other day. - [Woman] Really? - But it didn't end well. We really need a lot of prayer. - What did I do to make you hate me so much? I thought we were friends. - I don't need another person to judge me. - How do I judge you? - You're just like everyone else in this place. You think because you have Jesus you can tell people what they can and can't do. - If I remember correctly, last summer at camp you said you had Jesus too. - See your parents' car anywhere? - Yeah it's the red one. - All right, that's all we needed. - Does everybody remember what you're supposed to do? Hey, listen up, man. You know what you're supposed to do? - [Dylan] Yeah, got it. - Look, I have to get his diaper bag. Can you please watch him for a second? - Sure, but I'm not touching him. - You have always been on my prayer list and you've always been in my heart. I really think she'll be back, I really do. But we have to remember. It's not on our time, it's on God's time. And I'm gonna keep praying for you. - Thank you. - That's my sister, get back. We can't go now. No, we can't go. Not with my sister in there. She'll freak out. - Your son is in there. We're doing this. - Hey I'm all about second chances but I think we made a big mistake hiring that guy. - I just gotta ask. Is is because he's black? Do you have a problem with that? 'Cause that's what it seems like to me. - Hey, that's your words, not mine. - Bo, what is that? You can't bring a gun in there! - What? - [Bo] It's all part of the plan, man. It's just for intimidation. - No, you're kidding me, no. Put it back, we're done. I mean it. You're not taking a gun in there! - [Bo] Jess, quit it, stop! - No, you're not taking a gun with my son and my family in there. So put it back! Cadon, go! - [Bo] Will you shut up for a minute? - No, this is done! - I'm not entirely convinced at this point that you even want your son back. You just wanna abandon him, really? Like after all this? It's not even loaded. - Fine. But make it quick. In and out. And don't point it at anybody, okay? - Jess, get in the front seat. Switch with her. - I can still smell that. - I'll throw it away in a second. Look, Shawna, I'm sorry if I was judging you. It wasn't my intention. You're my friend and I care about you and I just want you to know that there's more to live for than what most people do. (tense music) - What are you doing, man? Set it up, go. - We're still gonna smell that when you take it. - Check the cabinet, there might be some air freshener. - Keep your mouth shut and no one gets hurt. Get over by the table. - Sheriff, is that you? - Lady, shut up and turn around. Put the money in the bag, let's go! Hurry up, put it all in the bag, let's go! You got 20 seconds! (knocking) - [Sheriff] Jessica? Hey Jessica. I haven't seen you in forever. - Hey Austin. Come here buddy, come here. Hey. His grandparents told me to come and get him. - Okay. - [Cadon] Come on, come on. (tense music) - Turn around, face the wall. - Your mom's just inside. Let me tell her that you're here. - You know, don't. She knows. She knows I'm here. - Well, good talking to you. Great to see you, take care. - Okay. Sure though, what are you doing here? - Oh I just help with the offering count on Sundays and I'm running a bit late too. (creaking) - Actually, I was wondering. Are you still a police officer? - County Sheriff now, going on three years. - Where's Austin? - Your parents had some guy pick him up. - [Jenn] Who? - I don't know, Austin ran right to him. - No, Austin's supposed to be hin here. - I'm really running late. I gotta get in there and sure is good to see you though. - Yeah. - Take care. - Excuse me, can I help you? - Oh, no, I'm just leaving, take you. - That's the Clarks' grandson, right? - Yeah, yeah, they told me to come get him. - Oh they did? - Yeah. - Okay well, you don't mind if we go confirm that, do you? - I really don't have time. What are you doing, hey? Wait, let me go! - [Susan] Do you have your cellphone? - No, I don't have it. - This phone is dead. - Calm down now. - What are you doing? - Easy. This is the toughest part, okay? - [Cadon] Let me go! - Let him go! - Hey! Put the gun down. - [Bo] Don't be stupid, man. - Put that gun down. (tense music) Hey, put the gun down. - Take your hand off that gun. - Put your gun down. - Don't be stupid, man. - I'm gonna tell you again, put the gun down. (gun firing) (groaning) - What was that? - I don't know, stay here. - Bo! (somber music) - Austin, come here. Here, here, come. - Cadon! Cadon! - Help me Jess. - What did you do? - He went for his gun, I had to! - We have to get out of here. - What's going on? - I don't know what's going on. I just saw a guy with a gun, a boy and a girl. We have to go! - Boy and a girl? Come on. - Look, stick to the plan. Where's Austin at? Cadon, where's Austin at? Go find him. - Help me, Bo. - Go! Cadon, snap out of it, he's dead, come on. Get up, let's go. (tense music) - Jess! - Hey! - What are you doing here? - Give me Austin. - Jess, what's going on? Did somebody get shot? - Yeah. - What? - Come with me, you'll be fine. Stay with me. (somber music) - [Woman] What are we gonna do? - We're getting a phone. In my car. - What? What else do you expect me to do? - [Cadon] He's dead, Bo. - Yeah, and you'd be dead too if I wouldn't have stepped in. Where's Dylan at? Is he in the car? - He never came outside. - Who's that? - Come on man, let's just go. - We're not leaving without Dylan. Stay here. (tense music) Hey, stop! (gun firing) - Man, did you blow a breaker? - That wasn't a breaker. Let me go check it out. - Come on, let's go, no one's leaving. Hurry it up! Come on, move! Go, get in there, come on. Let's go, come on, left, left! Get in there. Dude we gotta get everybody in there. There's people everywhere. Hey! Let's go, come on. Round the corner, yeah, let's go, run! - [Jenn] Jess, what's going on? - That fucking moron. - Hey, everyone where I can see you, let's go! Get away from the door! Get away! (gun firing) Get away from the doors, let's go, get to the middle! You too, get over here, let's go! No talking, everyone shut up and sit down! All right, here are the rules. No talking, nobody stands up, nobody tries anything! You try anything, I start shooting, does everybody understand? Do you understand?! No talking! - Where's Austin? Have you seen Austin? - I was in here. - [Sherry] Jenn, where's Austin? - They're out, Jess has him. - [Karl] Where's your mother at? - I don't know. - [Karl] You haven't seen her? - No, she told me to go to the nursery. - [Karl] She's not in the nursery? - No! - [Cadon] Yeah just scoot down the hall, go. Scoot down the hall. - Dude we have to keep these people in here. I'll watch them, you go find Dylan. - Dylan's probably already gone, man. We got Austin, mission accomplished. Let's just get out of here. - He's in here. This is one way in, one way out. They keep everything locked in here. He's in here. - Fine, watch these people. I'm gonna go look for him. - You checked the doors? - I didn't bring my keys. - Why would they be locked? - We started locking them ever since the break in. - Dylan! - Is that seven? - Excuse me, hey, ladies, ladies. (banging) Hey, turn that off. We gotta go to the big room. Everybody's meeting in there. I need you all to come with me now. - Are you okay? - Yeah I'm fine, look, somebody got hurt. We're trying to get everybody over to the big room. Please, come on, we gotta go now. - Are you sure you're okay? - I'm positive, I need you to come with me now, I'm serious, we need your help. Now come out this door and follow me, come on. Come on, will you come on?! - Okay. - I'm coming, I'm coming! - Come on. Bo! - All right, come on, hurry up, let's go. Come on, move! Get in here. - Sir, please, can I check on him? I'm a nurse. - [Bo] He's dead, get in there. Move! - Dylan! Come on man, we gotta go! - You know what, the best thing for us to start doing right now is to pray. We're already on our knees. All we have to do is just start praying to God. God'll take care of it. - [Old Man] Yeah, y'all pray. I'm gonna keep looking right down. - You know what, we should have never agreed to take Austin. - Sherry. - No, really. - Has anybody called the police? - Not that I know of. Nobody has a signal. - Mom, can we go home soon? - No, honey, we're gonna be here a little while. - I think you need to pray too. We all need to be praying right now. - I'm gonna pray with my eyes open. (hip hop music) - Look, let's just get Austin and we get out of here, okay? Okay? - Okay. - Dylan! Hey come on man, open the door! Open the door, come on! We gotta go! Hurry, come on open this door! Bo. Man, I checked the phone closet, it's locked. I beat on the door and Dylan's not answering. Every other door on this place is locked too. He's gotta be outside somewhere, man. Let's get out of here! - He's in there. Just let me get you some keys. All right, who has the keys to the building? Let's go, who has the keys?! - Cadon, I want out. We gotta get him out of here. I don't wanna be here. Why is this? - It's gonna be okay baby, don't worry about it. Look, we're gonna get out of here. - No, it's not okay. He's dead. And I've known him my entire life and he's dead! - Don't look over there, we didn't do that. Hey, that's not us. Don't look over there. - Who let you in this morning? - It was open when I got here. - [Bo] I better get an answer soon, who has the keys? - The janitor has the keys. - Tell him. - The janitor has the keys. - [Bo] Where is he at? - He's over cleaning the bathroom. - You, go get him. - [Shawna] Me? - [Bo] Yes! - I don't want to! - [Bo] It wasn't a question, go get him! - I'll do it. - No, look, I'll go get it. - Sit down. You, go. You can get everyone's cellphones. - No. - [Bo] Get up! (sobbing) - Sir? Sir, sir. We need your keys. - My keys, what's going on? - Yeah, there's a guy with a gun, he needs your keys. Just come on. - What? - [Jenn] I'm being serious. - Give me your phone. Where's your phone? - Hurry up! - Just take Austin and go. Come on, we can leave. - Cadon, you don't get it. My family is in there! I'm not just gonna leave them. - Then you take Austin and go. I'll go in there and I'll take care of Bo. And I'll take care of your family. They would want you to be safe. Just go. - Oh. What is going on here? Are you guys okay, is everybody all right? - [Bo] The keys, let's go! - Got the keys right here, everything's good. - Give 'em here. - [Andrew] You know where those go? - [Bo] Do you? - Every one of them. I know all the doors in this place. - [Bo] You're coming with me. - You got it. - Let's go. Hey, hey, hey, hold up, hold up, hold up. Where are you going? - She's going outside to the car. That was part of the plan, remember? She's gonna get it ready. - Plan has changed, man. In fact I think you need to get in there with everybody else. - What's the matter, she's on our team. - I don't know who's on my team right now. Let's go, come on. - It's okay. I'll just keep an eye on him. (somber music) - What is she doing? - Dude you've got the keys. You two go find him. If he tries anything, I'm gonna start shooting everybody. I don't care. - Hey, I'm just opening doors. - Look, Bo, we're gonna find your brother. Just promise me you won't shoot anybody else. - Just go find him. (thudding) - [Dylan] Stupid church. (banging) - Dylan! Hey come on, man! - We've gotta come up with a plan. We can't just sit here. - Let's just pray. Come on, let's just pray. - No, we need to find something to fight back. - [Susan] We need to pray. - I'm gonna go over there to her. - Be careful. - [James] I will. (tense music) - James, what are you doing? - Going to Jess. - What's he doing? - [James] Jess. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - I'm so sorry. - You come over here with us. I think you'll be safer. - No, take Austin. He'll be better with you. I'm gonna be fine. - Listen, we want both of you. - Okay. Mom, I'm so sorry. - It's okay sweety, we love you. - What's going on with you, man? - What's going on? I don't know if you've been paying attention but my friend just shot somebody. There's a dead body laying over there on the floor and we can't find his little brother. What's not going on right now? - Didn't ask about all that, man. I'm asking about you. How did you get mixed up in all this? - You wouldn't understand. - Try me. - You ever lost a son, hmm? I didn't think so. - Lost a son? I lost a family. I lost two kids and a wife. So tell me, what's going on with you, man? - [Jess] Can you hide for mommy? Can you get down there? Oh you're such a good boy. - [James] Is this your boyfriend? - No dad. It just got out of hand, everything. - [James] Why are they doing this? (tense music) - Hey I thought I said stop talking. Y'all think I'm playing? Y'all think this is some sort of game? - Hey, please, let the women and children go. - Nobody's going anywhere, stop talking. - Dylan! Dylan! Where are you!? - Hey, anybody in here? Hey. - You people brought this upon yourselves. I mean if your God is so in control then where is he? - He's still here. - He's here, really? Okay, well let's have a little test. Pray to your God that he takes this gun out of my hand. Come on, let's see it. Where you at, God? I'm right here. Come on, bring some wrath! You're so delusional you can't see what's right in front of your face. You know what I think, I think your God's a coward. - Dylan! I can't do this anymore. - You want to know the best thing that has happened to me? - What's that? - Is when I was in that exact same spot you are. - How can feeling like you're flat on your back possibly be a good thing? - It was the moment that I quit trusting in myself and what I could do. - What are you talking about? - You came in here broken thinking your son was the fix. And I'm telling you you could leave here today with your son and you'd still be broken. God knows you're broken and he gave the only fix, his son, Jesus. - I've heard that stuff before. - If you've heard it and you believe it, then talk to him. Tell him. Talk to Jesus, I'm gonna go down, check these last two rooms, you catch up with me. (tense music) - James! We've got to do something. We can't just sit here. We've gotta make a plan. - Dad, stop. They're gonna hear you. - It's gonna be okay. - [Shawna] I don't wanna die today! - [Karl] You're not gonna die. I'm not gonna let that happen. - You good? - Yeah. - I don't know man. I don't think dude is in this building. - I don't think so either but you know Bo ain't gonna believe that. - Yeah I know. - Who's talking?! Lady, you don't know how to shut up, do you? You talking to God? - I'm praying. And I'm praying for you. - Does it look like I want your prayers? - Let me tell you. God is in control in this room, not you. I'm not afraid of you and I'm not afraid of dying. - [Bo] Let's see about that. Hey! - She didn't mean any harm! - No, Bo. - Face down. All right, who's it gonna be? Who's gonna be the next hero? - Bo, you need to stop. This is enough. - So now you wanna speak up? You wanna tell everybody about how this was your idea? How we're here because of you? - Young man! (bashing) (everyone gasping) - What was that? - [Andrew] Go! - Y'all can thank Jess for that. - [Cadon] What was that? - Where is he?! - I don't know! I looked at all the rooms! I can't find him! - Are you kidding me? He's in here! Where else would he be, Cadon?! - Hold on, hold on, hold on, wait a minute. - [Old Man] Is she okay? - [Nurse] Yes, she's got a pulse, she's good. She's unconscious but she's gonna be okay. (mumbling) - [Old Man] Lord, is she okay? - Hey, there's a crawl space over the closet. We need to check it. - [Bo] Go check it! - Shawna. - [Shawna] I really meant what I said at church camp. - I know. But what happened? - I don't know. Life happened, and, my life's not like yours. I've made mistakes, big mistakes. - My life is so far from perfect, Shawna. We all make mistakes. - Yeah but, I really screwed up. And I've been so far from God the past two years and now I'm in here begging him to save me? - He's still listening. - Nah, I really don't think he would have gone in there. - I don't think so either but your buddy downstairs, we can't let him hurt anybody else. - What are we supposed to do? - I've been thinking. There's two doors to that room downstairs. If you can keep him away, I can unlock those doors and we can get them people out. - James. - [James] Karl, what are you-- - We gotta do something, man. - No. - No. - You've seen how these things end. - [Sherry] No, we keep praying. - Praying, really? - Yes, yes. - That's what happened when you keep praying. - Jess, is his gun the only one? - It's only Bo. Bo's the only one that's doing this. Cadon's trying to help, but, I don't know. - Where's our so-called janitor at? I haven't seen him. I bet you he's in on this. - I don't believe that. - Whatever, James. I wanna protect my family. Come here. - Karl, Karl! - Karl. - Karl. Karl, look at me. You don't have to do this. Please. - Susan, I can't do this in here. - Please stop. Karl, please. - You watch the kids. - Karl! Please don't. Karl, please. (tense music) - All right, we're good. If you can keep him distracted, we can start getting people out. - Y'all still praying in here? Didn't think so. (gun firing) (groaning) - Dad! (screaming) - Hey, stop! Shut up, stop! (screaming) Get over there! - [Karl] Susan, go with the kids! - Oh god, no! - [Karl] Go back to the kids! - Get over there! Come on move, let's go! (sobbing) - Shh. - [Cadon] Whoah, hold on! - [Andrew] You'll be all right, buddy. - This is enough, man! - He tried to jump me, self defense. Where's my brother at? - I have searched every square inch of this building. He's not inside. - You're worthless! - [Andrew] Just keep pressure on it. - You wanna do something? You take care of him! - Why don't you open your mouth again, see what else happens. - Hey man, you don't wanna do this. You don't wanna do this. Please, come on man. We know it was self-defense. We know it, it's all right. - Look, that door behind you is open, okay? I want you to take these people and get them out of here. Don't worry about nothing. I'm gonna take care of it, okay? I love you, Jess. - Cadon. We gotta go. - [Cadon] Bo, give me the gun. - Just get out of here. - I'm not gonna leave you here. - Let me watch these people for a little while. You go look for your brother. - Get him, Austin. - Hurry. (tense music) - I'm sorry sweety, I don't even know where we're going. Do you think I'm a good mommy? If you knew, if you only knew. You probably think I am but I'm not. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - I can't let go of anything. And I've done so much that I know in the back of my mind is so wrong. And I know it. And I can't let go. How should I expect God to forgive me when I can't forgive myself? When I can't forgive myself for what happens to you? I'm so tired of running. - Mama, no. (dramatic music) - Bo, give me the gun. Get your head together. - [Bo] You know as well as I do that we're stuck here, Cadon. This is bigger than Dylan now. - [Cadon] Where have you been? - What, I got locked in the closet. What the hell is that? He's dead. - This is what happens when you don't stick to the plan! - [Dylan] This wasn't in the plan. - Look, who cares? Dylan's here now. We got everything we came for, let's go. - We can't leave! Maybe you two can but they've seen my face. I'm the one that did this! There's no way that I can just walk out now! We have to finish this. - There's nothing to finish. Cadon and I have been talking. You guys could leave, no one will follow. And I can get some help for these people. - You and Cadon have been talking? That's how this is, you're - No. - Going behind my back now? - No. - [Bo] Then what is it, Cadon?! - I was just trying to stick to the plan. - You're gonna stick to the plan then where is Jess at? You think I didn't notice? Where's the car at, Cadon? How are we supposed to get away, did you think about that in your little plan? - [Dylan] Hey Bo, it's okay, just chill out-- - Don't tell me to chill out! Just let me figure this out. - There's nothing to figure out, man. You guys can just go. - So you're smarter than me? Is that how this is? - [Andrew] That's not it. - You trying to say you're smarter than me, is that what you're saying? - [Andrew] Not what I'm saying. Not what I'm getting at, man. - This is over, man. We're done. I don't even know how to say what I'm about to say to you. Something happened today. I know we never talked about God before. But I experienced something today, man, something big. And it's not too late for you to experience it too. It doesn't have to end this way. (laughing) - Oh man. So, you're telling me that you're with them now? After everything that I've done for you? I'm here because of you! Did you forget that?! All of this was to help you out! And now you're with this guy? - [Cadon] Don't. - Don't tell me what to do. Nobody tells me what to do! Not you and not your God! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna kill you and I'm gonna kill them. (tense music) (grunting) (bashing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (somber music) (Andrew groaning) - Andrew. - Did you get what you came for? - Yeah I think so. - Tell my family about it. (siren sounding in distance) - I wish I had the answer to why things like this happen but honestly I don't. But I know that somewhere in this tragedy God has made himself known. I believe that.
