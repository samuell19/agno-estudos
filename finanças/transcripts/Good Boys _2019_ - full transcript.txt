No, uh, someone signed me up as a joke. I was just crossing it off. See? Yeah, whatever, bitch tits. Enough. Let's go. - I have places to be. - Sorry, Soren. Don't listen to Atticus.

He's not gonna start sitting with the popular kids, is he? No. If anyone should be over there, it's me. We heard kids were calling you Sippy Cup, and we just wanted to let you know you can always call on the Student Coalition Against Bullying for protection. Does this look like a sippy cup? No, it's a fucking juice box. 'Cause I'm not a fucking child. That's so rude. Wait. Can I bring Thor and Lucas? So random. No, they're cool. I'm trying to keep it half girls, half guys. You feel me, dawg? I feel you, dawg, but... they're my best friends. We do everything together. We're the Bean Bag Boys. That's a dope-ass name. Fuck it. Bring 'em. I ride or die for my squad, too. Let me know what your mom says, dawg. Okay. Bye, dawg. Bye, dawgs. So? Soren just invited us to his party tomorrow. - Soren? - Yeah. He said my name? He said "Thor"? - Pretty much, yeah. - Sweet. Oh, there's also gonna be girls there. You know what that means? Drama. Kissing. So, do you guys know how to kiss? - I have no fucking clue. - No. No, not at all. Type "kissing." Ooh. No, no, no. "Boobs." "Breast cancer research." "How to find a bra that fits." I have an idea. "Are you 18 or older?" I'm gonna click "yes." We're not 18 or older. This could go on our permanent record. I'm your stepmother. You are not supposed to be - looking at me in the shower. - Don't tell my dad. He'll make me quit the sports team. Get up. Get up. He's in trouble. You deserve a punishment. Pull down your shorts. Is that what happens when you get a stepmom? Ew. No way that's gonna fit in there. Get out of there, girl! Where did his hand go? - Ew! - Oh, my God! Nobody even kissed. Yeah, not on their mouths at least. My parents have a CPR doll. We can go practice kissing on that. Come on. This is a really pretty CPR doll. I guess I'll go first. Stop. What are you doing? Kissing her. You can't kiss someone without their permission. Remember from assembly? Pretend it's Brixlee. - Try to be a gentleman. - Okay. Brixlee, can I kiss you? Why? - Why? - Yeah. What do you like about me? Well... you're sweet. You smell good. You're smart, too. You always push Henry in his wheelchair even though he's super mean. And just when I think I've got you figured out, you go ahead and start skateboarding. I consent. - How was it? - Sticky. Why does she have hair in her mouth? You know what? This isn't teaching us anything. We need to see real people kissing. That's the only way to know if we're doing it right. My neighbor is a total nymphomaniac. Her boyfriend's always over. She starts fires? No, that's a pyromaniac. She's a nymphomaniac. Someone who has sex on land and sea. Seriously? Okay, I was gonna wait till tomorrow to surprise you, but can I just tell you? - Nah, I'm good. - No, you want to know. Ugh. I can barely see anything. I know we haven't been hanging out much, you know, ever since I met Benji, but I want to make it up to you. So, tomorrow, I'm skipping school, and we're driving to the city to see Kendrick Lamar. - Shut up! - And we're gonna do Molly. - You thought of everything. - Of course I fucking have. It's gonna be amazing. Remix! Well, Benji got us the Molly. - Benjamin. - Oh, thank you! Look. This isn't working. Maybe we could go climb a tree. No, they'd see us. No, I just meant let's go climb a tree. Dude, wait. I know a way we can see them kiss. I can't. It has a camera. We could see everything. We can learn technique. It's for his dad's work. It's not a toy. Of course it's a toy. They sell it at toy stores. My uncle flew a drone for the Army, and now he yells in his sleep and has crazy diarrhea. It's messed up that he even keeps it in the house. You have to walk by it every day. - He's torturing you. - It's true. It's like when your cousin walks around in a bikini and she taunts you. If he finds out, you'll be grounded. You won't be able to go to Soren's. And even worse, you'll lose your father's trust. It's true, too. She'll love you for who you are. Yeah, a shitty kisser. Remember the porn from earlier? That guy didn't even know how to kiss. He was just licking that woman's asshole. - You want to kiss an asshole, Max? - No. Max, don't listen to him. He just wants to go because he's obsessed with popular boys. Believe me, Max. You don't want to go to Soren's not knowing how to kiss. So, tomorrow, after you get some girl time, why don't you come over for some man time? No, I told you I'm hanging out with Lily this weekend. Yeah, it's just... you know, it's hard for me not to see you, 'cause you're my best friend. - But Lily's my best friend. - Yeah, I get it. Totally, totally get it. Yeah. I'll probably just hang out with my ex, Margaret. Are you trying to make me jealous? Uh, no. Why? Are you jealous? Yeah, this isn't working out. I know. You're not hot enough to be acting like this, so the next time that you're wondering where all the nice guys went, just remember that you let one walk right out the door. What? I didn't say anything. I never want to see you again. Are you okay? Wait, where'd the guy go? Who cares? The girls just hugged. They are definitely gonna kiss. We might need to get closer. Do you hear that? What is that? It's fucking spying on us. - All right, it's my turn to fly. - Give it! - I just want to buzz 'em. - No! Hey, you're gonna break it. You want it? Fine! Shit! Ha! No! - Shit! What the hell, Thor? - That was both of our faults. Well, Dad's gonna kill me. What do I do now? - Whoa! - What the hell?! - We say there was a break-in. - What...? They trashed the place and took the drone. That's the most stupid fucking idea I've ever heard! Guys, guys. All we have to do is just go over there and tell the truth, then God will be on our side. Hey. Can I help you? Uh, I hope so, madam. We were using our drone to follow a family of turtles, and we thought it might have crashed in your backyard. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's here. Come on in. - So, you guys like turtles? - Yeah. - That's awesome. - Time's up, motherfuckers. Shit! It's a trap. You think I give a fuck about turtles? We're sorry. We just wanted to learn how to kiss. Lucas, it's none of their business. We should have just told the truth. We're going to a kissing party, and none of us have ever kissed, and we're scared. Goddamn it, Lucas. I've had sex before, but I've never kissed a girl. Just go online and type in "how to kiss." That's what everyone does. Oh. It's very easy. Look, can we please have the drone back? It's a BD Rolling Thunder. It's my dad's. He needs it for work. Can I please have it back? - I really need it. Please. - I don't think so. If you don't give it back, I'll tell my dad you stole it. And I'll tell him that you're a pervert. We'll tell the whole school. This is sensual harassment. We'll tell everyone that you're a misogynist. I never massaged anyone. This is what happens when you don't respect women. I respect women. My mom's my best friend. What about me? Oh, God, I'm so fucked. My dad's gonna kill me. You had to snoop on them. You're such a feminist. I'm-I'm not a feminist. I love women. And my parents are definitely gonna call your guys' parents. We're all gonna get grounded. Forget Soren's party. We're fucked. Why are you smiling? This is actually your fault. This is leverage. Oh. Bingo. - What is it? - I have no idea. That's a tampon. - What's it for? - Girls shove it up their buttholes to stop babies from coming out. An eighth-grader told me that. The human body is truly a mystery. Can't believe they still eat chewables. The gummies are so much better. I like the chewables. I want one. Fucking childproof bullshit! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor! It's the girls. Hello? You took my bag. It has my license, my phone. Bring it back right now. Fuck that noise. I want my drone back. I got this. I got this, I got this. What did you just say, you little bitch? I'll take a shit down your throat. Why are you talking like that? Hannah, I have a little brother. - You're supposed to scare them. - Well, you scared me. Listen, we-we were just trying to teach you a lesson. I promise you we were gonna give the drone back. No way. They could trick us again. Or overpower us. Oh, my God. What if they take the Molly? Then we wouldn't be able to take it. No, they're children. They would die. This is Max from earlier. Meet us at the playground across from John Adams tomorrow at 7:40 a.m. Bring the drone, and don't fuck with the Bean Bag Boys. - That was tough. - Very tough. I kind of got a boner talking to those girls. We're still on the phone. - Shit! Fuck, fuck. - What the shit?! Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15... Ow. Don't come any closer. - Why? - 'Cause you could overpower us. So, put the drone on the slide, and count back from a hundred, and close your eyes. And don't try anything funny. There are witnesses. Okay, we have a long drive ahead of us, so give us the bag or I will hurt you. Do not test me. Threats will get you nowhere, peasant. Just give us the fucking Molly! Okay. Who's Molly? 'Cause she's not with us. Guys. Molly is a sex drug. Dateline did an exposé on it. You had us bring drugs to a fucking playground?! There are children here! - Shit. - It's okay. I know what to do. We're making a citizen's arrest! You're both under arrest! - Get on the ground! - Sweet Jesus. - Up, up, up! - Stay still! - Hands up! Hands up! - Stay still! Get down now! Get down now! Did you just reload your fake gun? - Are you mocking me? - Put your hands up! Are you mocking me?! Anything will be used against you - that you say. - In court. You know, you're the one holding drugs, so why don't I do a citizen's arrest on you? Fuck. Time-out, crackheads. Oh, my God. Deal's off. We can't let them put drugs back on the street. Look at those dirty fucking junkies. Their lives are already ruined. Let's just give them the drugs and get the drone. Maybe there's a way we can protect our community and get the drone back. Stall them. So, what do you plan to do with those drugs, huh? Take 'em and feel amazing. They're addicts. Yeah. So, you been drugging your whole life? - Uh-huh. - E'r'day. Oh. Nice. What's he doing? Hey. - Yes! Yes! - It's working! - It's working! - Yes! Fly it to the school! You're heading for the trees! Watch out! We're gonna make it! We're gonna make it! Fuck! Those girls are lucky I didn't kick their asses. Oh, no! They found us! - Oh, shit. - They're on school property. They don't care. They're tweaking. You know who we need? - No, don't say it. - We'll look like losers. - Don't say it. Don't say it. - SCAB! - Shut up. - SCAB! - Shut up. Zip it. - Lucas, shut up. - SCAB! - What is that? There's three boys in danger! We're scared! SCAB, help us! We're okay. - We're not scared. We're... we're fine. - Lucas, shut up. Just walking into school. - Average day. - Jesus Christ. Bullying is wack. Get on the right track. Bullying is wack. Get on the right track. Bullying is wack. Get on the right track. Bullying is wack. When you attack one of us, you attack all of us. Your weakness gives us strength. - Well, those kids stole my bag. - Not today, bully! Not today. - What the fuck? - Bullying is wack. Get on the right track. This is the best day of my life. Get on the right track. Don't worry, we'll find them later. SCAB just tagged us on Instagram. First Sippy Cup, and now this? I'm two weeks into sixth grade, I'm already a social piranha. Guys, my dad gets back at 5:00. If we don't get a new drone by then, I'm grounded. Which means we're all grounded, which means no party, which means no Brixlee. - Sippy Cup for life. - No Brixlee, no friends, no hope, parents fighting, trapped in our rooms, all alone, two Taco Tuesdays. So, Max, what are we gonna do? We're gonna ditch school and get a new drone. Stop thinking with your big old dick, Max. That could go on our permanent record. Max's big old dick is pointing us in the right direction. Thank you. If anyone else kisses Brixlee, I'll die. Wait, what? Here's the plan. I'm gonna bring a beer to Soren's, and I'm gonna sip that beer so everyone will know... That you're an alcoholic. - That would be great. - Guys. The only place around here that has one is at North Point Galleria. That's four miles away. Four miles? How the fuck are we getting four miles? - You have Uber. - No, it goes directly to my mom's phone. She'll know. Then we bike. Where are you even gonna get the money for a new drone? - What? - You know. Our Turzan of Uzkara card? No way! You said everyone wants to buy it. - We got it together. - And we're gonna sell it together, as friends. Come on, Lucas. Bean Bag Boys do everything together. Okay. Guess that makes sense. - Yes! - Yes! - Lucas! Bean Bag Boys for life. - Yeah! We're being so bad. ♪ We're bad, we're so bad ♪ ♪ We're bad, we're so bad ♪ ♪ We're bad, we're so bad. ♪ I need to get rid of these drugs. - What are you doing?! - Getting rid of the drugs! I'm just gonna throw them in the stream. It can contaminate the water. Well, then we can throw it in the forest. It's a sex drug. What if a fox eats it and tries to fuck a squirrel? It'll kill him. Well, then how do we get rid of drugs? The same way we get rid of a baby. - Abortion? - Adoption? No. We drop it off at the firehouse on our way up to the mall. That's a really good idea. Ah. I just got a bite on our card. Nice. Give 'em my address. My parents aren't home, and I have the best snacks. PeterPan69 is gonna be here in five minutes to buy the card. Well, let's get ready. I found all of these weapons in the back of my parents' closet. I still don't get why we need weapons. He could be a pedophile. He can't molest all three of us. All he needs is one. "An-al beads"? Aka nunchucks, motherfucker. Ooh. - Yeah! - It's not a toy. Oh, shoot. They smell like shit. Hello. Uh, I'm looking for Lucas. - That's me. - I'm Claude. Hey. That's my mom back there. Hi-ya! Let's cut the shit. Are you a pedophile? What? No. Lucas, if you were a pedophile standing in front of three single boys, - would you admit it? - Probably not. Then why would he? Oh, come on. Do I look like a pedophile? - Sure do. - Yes, absolutely. - 1,000%. That's not fair. You look more like a pedophile than anyone I've ever seen. Look, I'm not a pedophile. I'm a cool guy. Fine. You can come in, but please take your shoes off. You know, I've searched the world for this. Why are you bringing the paintball gun? In case anyone fucks with us. This card is exquisite. - How'd you get it? - The summer I moved here, me, Max and Thor started a dog-washing business. We earned eight bucks, and we used the money to buy an Ascension pack, and this card was in it. Well, you got very lucky. The real luck was meeting Max and Thor. Fascinating. We started calling ourself the Bean Bag Boys. - You know why? - Because you had some beanbags? - That's right. - Yeah. Genius. You got yourself a deal. Let's go. Let's make it happen. No, I can't do this. Sorry. Lucas, get your butt over here right now. Excuse me, is this how all 12-year-olds conduct business? What the hell just happened? I thought you were cool with this. You said we wouldn't do this if one of us wasn't on board. - I'm not on board. - Why do you care so much? Why don't you care? This card has a lot of memories, and you're just gonna throw it all away because you want to kiss some basic girl? Savage. Brixlee isn't just some girl. We're probably gonna get married. Every marriage ends in divorce. Lucas, you're outvoted. Listen, I can tell you're lashing out with anger, but Brixlee is probably the love of my life. Excuse me, ma'am. Can I get a glass of water, please? Hello? Hey, guys? Hmm. Yeah. What can you tell me about her backstory? Where is she supposed to be from? She seems quite exotic. Okay, listen carefully, 'cause I'll make this offer only once. 400 bucks to take her off your hands. No. We need 550, U.S. Fuck off. What? That's my entire allowance. Listen, Claude, let's just cut the bullshit. I'm the son of a businesswoman, and I think we both know, if you didn't want to buy the doll, you would've left already. Stop treating us like kids.

It says this next part's gonna hurt, that you should bite down on something hard. I know. Open. There you go. Okay. - On three. - One, two, three. - Just got a text from Taylor. - What'd she say? She wants to know why you aren't in school and if you're coming to the party tonight. Just write... Okay, sorry. One, two, three! Oh! Let me help, let me help. - Focus! On three. - One! Two! Three! Hmm? Wow. I didn't think that'd actually work. You're gonna be good, man. No. I'm really not. My parents are getting a divorce. What'd you do? - Thor! - What? Sorry. My dad's moving out.

Just be normal. What do you think about politics? It's a complicated issue. This cop's acting weird. He's eye-fucking us. Just act normal. Just laugh. We're just two cool guys laughing. We skipped school. Lucas! Are we in trouble? Yeah, well, usually, I'd call this in, but because you were honest with me, I'm gonna let you slide, all right? Just promise not to do it again, okay?

I'm the nicest kid in our grade. It goes me, Marcus, Max, you. - I'm way nicer than Max. - No, you're not! You made Ms. Willoughby cry last year. Hey, she was already crying. I just took her picture.

So funny. No, I did. I sold it. Two girls, said they knew you. Fuck you! - Jesus. - I'm gonna kill your family, and then they're - gonna come alive... - Ease off the sugar, huh? - ...and turn your whole family into zombies! - Max! I was gonna say... you didn't let me finish... they left a note for you. Why are they walking like that? I don't know. How'd you guys track us? We threw your bag in prickle bushes. Dumbass, you told us that your life would be over if you didn't get a BD Rolling Thunder, and this is the only place - a child could get to on a tricycle. - Okay. I have the drugs. Now give me the drone. Are you fucking kidding me? What in the actual fuck? These are just gummy vitamins. - Shit. - Told you she was gonna check. - Fuck. - Where is the Molly? - Where is it? - A cop has it. You gave our drugs to a cop? Wait. Look. I know you don't know us and you think we're just stupid kids, but just listen to me. Whatever problems you're having, drugs are not the answer. Drugs just give you a false sense of reality. You may think your lives are bad, but you have family and friends who love you. Can you shut the fuck up? I just spent $600 on a fucking drone. You ruined my passionate moment. - Well, it was stupid. - This day is fucked. Benji is the only one who has Molly, and he won't sell it to us. Okay. Well, I'm sorry. We're fucked. We'll do it. We'll get your drugs. - The fuck we will. - What the hell, dude? Do you think he would sell to kids? We're not kids. We're tweens. What do we have to lose? So, it's a deal? Max, this is fucking insane. Just take your goddamn punishment. Lucas and I will go to the party. We'll cock-block anyone that gets near Brixlee. They didn't invite you. What? The popular kids only invited me. What do you mean? They think you're kind of... random. - Oh. - But it's okay, 'cause once those guys get to know you, they'll see what I see, that you're not random. That you're specific. I'm not buying drugs. - Neither am I. - You guys don't have to. I'll do all the talking. I just need your height in there. You're the only one of us that looks like they could be in college. Guys. Are you in or out? So, you guys did all of this for a kissing party? No. There's also gonna be cool boys there. I remember my first kissing party. It was the summer after sixth grade at Manush Patel's house. Who'd you kiss? Uh, Manush's sister. Wait, you weren't there? No, we didn't really know each other then. I mean, we were in the same grade, but we didn't really become close until eighth grade. Oh. I just figured you guys - knew each other for longer. - Yeah, everybody knows you meet your best friends in kindergarten. - Yeah. - Yeah, the only reason you're friends with people back then is 'cause you live close to each other. Or, because, like, your parents are friends. No. That's not true for us. We're friends because we like each other. - And we live close together. - And our parents are friends. Okay, come here. Go in. Buy two pills. Ask for Benji. Do not mention Hannah. - Who's Hannah? - I am. Oh. I'm Max. Yeah, I know who you are. Okay, just go in there, buy the pills, and then I'll trade you for the drone. Okay, if this goes bad, drive off. - Okay. - Okay. It's not too late to turn back. No. We have to get the drugs so we can get the drone, so we can go to the party. Hello? I am your daddy! You are my baby! Listen, you will stay down here and suffer until you learn to be men! Listen! What you babies wearing? - Diapers! - That's right! Good evening. We're looking for Benji. Hey, dickless. Come here. - Yes, Daddy. - All right, I need you to go find Benji. Tell him he's got visitors. Yes, Daddy. I ask the fucking questions! That's your son? You guys can go sit your asses down over there and wait. Whatever happens to you is your own fucking fault. Drop and give me 20, you fucking babies! Listen! Four! Get up! Can I help you? Good afternoon. We would like to buy two pieces of Molly, please. Did Rafi from Sigma Nu send you? He did, that fucker. You guys are, like, seven. Oh, except for you. I recognize you from econ. What's up, man? Seriously, I'm not selling drugs to kids. We're not kids. We're tweens. Who told you to come here? Sell us the drugs, and you'll find out. All right. Stay there. Hey. How long do you think he's gonna be? Oh, you made me high. Ah. Tell me who sent you. Hannah. What? I'm high as fuck. So, this is what she thinks of me, huh? You can tell Hannah that if she wants Molly, she can suck my dick. You shouldn't talk about women like that. The only time she should suck your dick is when she gives you consent. You can suck my dick, and you can suck my dick, too. What about me? I'm just gonna sit here? We're the Bean Bag Boys. We do everything together. Get the fuck out of here, you little fucking babies. Let's go. Get out! Hey, guys, wait. I have something in here that might change your mind. Hurry up. Pledges, listen! Bitch! Now who's the baby?! - Holy shit. - What the fuck? If I don't get those drugs, I'm gonna be grounded, and then I'll never get to kiss Brixlee! Max, what the fuck are you doing? You sell drugs. We came here to buy them. So now you're gonna sell us the drugs. Do not test me! Okay. You want the drugs? I'm not your parent. Here. Thanks. Oh, shit. Oh, you're fucking dead. What the fuck's going on down here? Whoa! She just dropped the charges. Oh, God. ♪ You'd better run ♪ ♪ You'd better run ♪ Holy shit. ♪ You'd better run from the Devil's gun... ♪ Max, watch out! I got your back. Thor! Your ass is mine! Oh, my God, I just killed a man! Lucas, get the drugs! ♪ The Devil's fire ♪ ♪ Just won't go out... ♪ We were never here! Start the fucking car! Max! - What's happening? - Fucking go! - What? - Shit, shit, shit! Drive! Drive! Lucas, drugs. No, no, no, no, no. Let me see what's in the bottle. Yeah. Of course. Okay, just-just give it to me. Wow, you guys are little badasses. 'Cause we're the Bean Bag Boys. I don't know what that means. We have beanbags. It's been real, guys. Have fun at your kissing party. Thank you. Oh. We're only 1.7 miles away. What's wrong? We got the drone. Everything worked out. Max. I got punched in the fucking face, okay? We bought drugs. Can we just go home now? Guys, it's my dad. Hey, Dad. Hey, buddy. I got on the early flight, so I'll be home in 15 minutes. 15 minutes from now or 15 minutes from later? Ha-ha, funny guy. I'll see you soon. My dad will be home in 15 minutes. M-Maybe he won't notice that the drone's gone. He'll notice. He's very observant. That's why my mom fell in love with him. The drone has to be home before your dad. I know. Just the drone. Not you. Just the drone. Okay. Here we go. - Yes! - Yes! - Careful. - I got this, I got this. Oh! Fly like the wind, Max. Yeah, uh, take a right up here. - I can see your house. - There it is. There it is. The windows are closed. - Shit. What do I do? - The chimney. - It's very tight. - You got this. Shit! I can't see. I can't see. There's ash all over the camera. Use the Force. - No, no, I can do this. - Uh... I know my house perfectly. - I can do this with my eyes closed. - Okay. Don't break anything. Trust me, I got this. - Yeah! - You did it! You got it! - Yes! - I'm the best pilot ever! Yes! - I think we did it. - Yeah. Mission accomplished. Hey, Dad. Did you get home safe? Cannot believe I trusted you! I explicitly told you, - do not touch the drone! - Uh-huh. - Oh, my God. - I love you. Dad? Dad, please... say "I love you" back. I need to hear it. Hello? My dad said that I'm grounded. Now I'm never gonna be able to kiss Brixlee. It's okay, Max. There'll be other parties. - Lucas, you don't get it. - He's right, Lucas. This party could change our lives, and you don't even care. It's not cool at all. Yeah, you would know what's not cool. What the fuck does that mean? Go sip a beer, Sippy Cup. I love beer, so yes, I will. And you may think you're so mature, but the truth is you don't have pubes, and I have six. You say you have pubes, but you also say you drink beer, and I know you don't. - Stop arguing! - Just admit you skipped the audition because you thought it wasn't cool even though your voice is a fucking gift. And you always talk a big game, and you never back it up. - Like on the freeway. - Oh, sorry. I didn't want to cross 12 lanes of traffic so you can kiss some skank. - Oh, shit. - She's not a skank. She's the love of my life. You take that back! Hey, no karate. Stop fighting! You should never call a woman a skank. You should never call a woman anything. And you... You made us ditch school, run around with drugs, and lock a cop in a convenience store with what I now suspect is a dildo! What the fuck are you looking at, Gandalf?! You guys don't understand shit. I have hormones flowing through my body, making me do crazy things. Do you even know what it feels like to want to rub up against a tree all the time? You think you're better than us. Not better, just more mature. I'm into romance and grown-up shit, and you guys are still into little kid stuff. I don't even know why we're still friends. Everything you like is now canceled. Birthdays are canceled. Holidays are canceled. Summers, canceled. Winter is coming. - I'm sorry, Daddy. - No, no, no. You are no longer allowed to call me Daddy. Call me Andrew or Mr. Newman or Warden. Underneath that cherubic face, Devil lives inside you. I will always love you because you are my son, but I no longer like you. Thorny. I just got off the phone with Max's mom. Did you know he skipped school and biked to the mall by himself? - He said that? - He did. Promise me you'll never do something as stupid as that, okay? I-I promise. And then we ran across the highway, my arm got ripped out, and a fake woman shot out of a car. But we still got the drugs. But then we traded the drone for it, and-and Max destroyed his house with it. But it was only because he wanted to marry Brixlee, and now he can't because he's grounded for life. And we got into a huge fight, and the Bean Bag Boys are broke up, and... - Am I in trouble? - Okay, son. Now, look, I love a good story with a bunch of gibberish just as much as anybody, okay? And I know you're going through a stressful time. But it doesn't give you a reason to tell us fibs. I'm not fibbing. I'm 100% sure you're fibbing to me. - I'm not fibbing. - Okay. I think I understand what's happening here. You think you're losing us, and now you're worried you're gonna lose your friends, too. Look at me, man. We'll always be there, right? I mean, and look, don't get me wrong. You know, me and your mom are not the same people we were when we first met. Mm-hmm. Tend to grow apart sometimes. But-but it's okay. You remember your hermit crab? - Herman? Yeah. - That's right. Herman. - And you remember why he died? - Oh, son of a... You told me he ran away! Technically, yes, he ran away, but then he died. Oh, my gosh. How? Herman died because hermit crabs grow out of their shells, and they need to find new, bigger seashells on the beach to grow into, or they die, and we didn't know that. So, Herman died because of you guys? The point is... you and your friends are growing and changing, and y'all need to find bigger shells. And there's nothing wrong with that. Okay, look, you need to blame those pet store owners, okay, because they did not give us the information about hermit crabs... It's Lucas. You scared the shit out of me. I didn't want your parents to see my face. Why are you even here? I've grown a lot in the last two hours. My parents' divorce has really changed me. If the Bean Bag Boys don't grow together, they'll grow apart. I don't want that. I don't want to get a divorce from you. Then you need to go to Soren's party. - You need to sneak out. - I can't. I'm grounded. Besides, Brixlee's necklace is still in the kiln. Let me worry about the necklace. And what are your parents gonna do, double-ground you? Is Brixlee your forever or not? Then you need to come with me now. Fine, I'll go, but I'm not apologizing to Thor. - He's not coming. - Good. Fuck that bitch. I'll go get my jacket. - Hey, Max. - Yeah? Bring that dick. You said Thor wasn't coming. What the hell is he doing here? I Parent-Trapped your asses. See, now we're all in a bigger hermit crab shell together. It made sense when my parents said it. So, you took the blame for us, huh? Yeah. I thought about what you would do, and did the opposite. This party, it's gonna be an epic rager. Okay, Sippy Cup. Just stay out of my way, Maxi Pad.

Not much. Just, uh, got into a fight with a bunch of men and, uh, stole a beer. There's no way Sippy Cup is gonna drink it. Not only am I gonna drink it, I'm gonna break the record. I'm gonna take four sips. Four is impossible. - Soren can't even do four. - Shut up. Drink. That's one. Big deal. That's two. Mm-kay. That's three! This is insane. He's gonna barf. Somebody get him a sippy cup. Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup! Sippy... That's fucking four! Oh, fuck! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

But if you're staying down here, you better strap in, because shit's about to get real. - Hell yeah. - Okay. Let's spin a bottle.

No. You don't want to do that. You're gonna stay down here and kiss Brixlee. The Bean Bag Boys do everything together. Not everything. Not anymore. Maybe those old girls were right. Maybe we're on different paths. Yeah. Then what are you gonna do? I don't know. I just know it's not this. No way. This is insane. Forget spin the bottle. Now, go over there and kiss your future wife. Bye. Bye. Brixlee, can I kiss you? Okay. Cool. Where am I? Oh, here I am. Lucas, I'm leaving. You sure you don't want to try this? Nah, I'm good.

I can't believe you guys are here. Oh, this is so amazing. - Hi. - Oh, hi. - Sit down. Please no, please no. Don't kill us. Look what happened. How do you know Soren? Is he your boyfriend? He's my brother. I love that piece of shit. You guys, where's everybody else? Where's your friend with the sad eyes? - Sad boy Max. - In the basement kissing. It's an orgy down there.
