(intriguing retro music) (helicopter blades whirring) - [Leader] This is Blue Leader to Flight. Blue Leader to Flight. - [Pilot] We have go status. Let's set up our approach. Switch to starlight. - Roger that. Right comin' for us 270. Maintaining alpha 120. - [Pilot] Copy, visual. - [Pilot] Looking good, looking good. All right, let's tighten up. Brake left. (intriguing retro music) (helicopter blades whirring) - Blue gets to hook up 05 minutes 'til Delta 0. - Five, roger that. Five minutes to drop zone. Gear check. Set up your combo. Intel says the bad guys will be home. I don't know what that means. (intriguing retro music) (gun cocking) 'Kay, rules of engagement: shoot only if you have to. It's not gonna be an easy option. Don't get cocky. I'd like to apprehend the prime suspect, not cap him. Everybody got that? (intriguing retro music) (helicopter blades whirring) - This is Blue leader. I've got a visual on the coastline. That means we're on their radar, gentlemen. Bring 'er down to Angels 50. Watch yourselves. We're flyin' (drowned out by music) the earth. - We're at foreign airspace. Host government has denied permission. What else is new? (intriguing retro music) - [Leader] Code chief, we have a green live. Repeat, we have a green live. (intriguing retro music) Go, go, go! Go, go, go! (intriguing retro music) (helicopter blades whirring) Clear. Repeat, we are clear. - Okay, roger that. We'll go fuel. Lookin' for that big tanker in the sky. Later. (dark retro music) (frogs croaking) - Dude, what do ya got? - Two Talibans, one of them sentry. - Thor here. I'm in place. My kill zone's the main gate to the waterfront. Let me set my ranges. (liquid bubbling) (monitor beeping) (frogs croaking) - [Frank] Somebody keeping an eye on grandpa? - [Rick] Oh, we're dead, Frank. - [Frank] Make sure you keep up. (dark retro music) (frogs croaking) (liquid bubbling) (monitor beeping) You're huffin' and puffin', grandpa. You sure you're gonna make it through this mission? - [Rick] Goddammit, Frank. I haven't done this for a while. I'm nervous enough as it is. - Top Kick and Spook Show in position. Bravo, read. - Copy. - Bigfoot, read. - Yeah, copy. - Cowboy, read. Ironman, read. - Copy. - Duke, read. - Yeah, that's a copy. - Top Kick, Spook Show. Ready for initial assault. - You ready to get dressed for the party? - You mean undressed. (liquid bubbling) (monitor beeping) (heartbeat thumping) Goddammit, keep up. - [Rick] I'm tryin' to. - Okay, everybody in place. Let's do it. Okay, check out all the windows. - Roger that, Top Kick. (dark retro music) (frogs croaking) Let's get one. Get one towards here. - Skipper, give us our target. (loud clanking) (both chattering) - Top Kick, Spook Show. - [Top Kick] Yes, Spook Show? - I'm at the bottom of the stairs. - Bottom of what stairs? - I think I'm in section Lima. Or maybe it's Kilo, I'm not sure. - You don't know what section you're in? - This wall is goddamn 25 yards long. I don't know where they are. - Thor, help him out. Scope out the outside of the building. - [Thor] Problem. I got a vehicle approaching. - [Frank] You got a vehicle coming up? - [Thor] Affirmative, man. Yeah, these guys are getting out. - [Frank] Okay, everybody. We got company. Who are they? What's their status? - [Thor] One's got an AK and two are entering the building. - Okay, people. Everybody, take cover. Let's see what's goin' down. (dark retro music) - Ah, Gula. I was not expecting you. - Khaleel, where is the shipment going? I will tell you where the shipment is going. You are transporting it to Istanbul. From there, by freighter to Yugoslav coast. Khaleel, this is not the usual arrangement. - Yes, Gula. There is something of which we need to speak. - [Frank] Thor, help him out. Read the yardages too. - [Thor] Okay, five yards from the exterior bulkhead. Equip 0.4. - That's gotta be the window. I figure about half way. - Jesus Christ. I got too much fuckin' equipment here. What happened to the old days, man? - Goddammit, you old fart. Just set that up. - I got shit all over the place. - Rick, you're talkin' to yourself. - Yeah, well so what? Don't you? (soft foreboding music) (group chattering) Okay, I'm gonna start drillin'. (drill whirring) - Thor, can you see what's goin' on? - Okay, yeah. I can see movement through the windows. I can't tell who it is. You gotta gimme some help on this. - Okay, I'm through. I've got it. I'm settin' up the fiber optic system now. Oh no, just a second whether I'm through or not. - Goddamn, I wish intel had given us better mock-up. - It is a matter of grave importance. - Top Kick, Spook Show. I just hit the jackpot. - There is a source of huge potential income for operation. We must diversify. There is a vast untapped market. - (chuckles) So now you are making policy, huh? Khaleel. Hey, please. What do you mean? Explain. - Well my friend, I'm starting to build a covert operation in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. - What? - With everything that has happened there, I feel it would be an enormous market for us. - I got three males. One of 'em. Yeah, one of 'em's the prime suspect. - All right, we got Khaleel in there. Okay, gentlemen. It's showtime. Bravo, let's get set up for the assault. - The people want our products. It's a vast untapped marketplace and their governments are so weakened by decentralization that they will be powerless to stop us. - Yes, but the economies are in ruin. There is no hard currency. Khaleel, this is stupid. We will make no money. - By selling our own products maybe. But my labs, they have synthesized several new drug compounds and we don't need vast agricultural holdings in foreign countries. These drugs are made in laboratories. We can make them for practically nothing! - So we trade rats for cows and chickens maybe, not hard cash. Khaleel, this is insane. - I am not insane! Listen to me, I am not insane. I know. (soft foreboding music) (group chattering) - Goddammit, I'm pinned down. Spook Show, what do you see? - Khaleel, maybe you don't realize that in the Soviet Union such illegal enterprise is frowned upon highly. Yeah? They have a 5 million men standing army highly-trained with nothing to do. You think if they arrest you, they read you your rights like the Americans? In Russia, the Soviet Union, there is only one penalty. - The Soviet Army runs on vodka! I don't care about them. I will orchestrate a total campaign of terror. No one will be safe. I will destabilize their government like we did in Columbia. - You're insane. You will waste all our resources. - There is international terrorist network already in place. And I have made overtures to their leadership and they are receptive. - Absolutely no! No! Khaleel, those people are political. They're not to be trusted. They cannot be bought and sold like the rest of the world. No, no! It is over! - Oh shit. - Rick, talk to me. - We got problems, man. We got problems. - [Frank] Rick, specify. (Gula shouting) - You've done enough. You're finished. - Hey, they're gonna do Khaleel, man. Is your team in place? - [Thor] My team is not in place. - What do you mean they're not in place? We ain't got much time, man. Somethin's happenin' here. - [Thor] Do you copy? Hidden in the goddamn corner here. - [Frank] Thor, what do you see? - They're movin' across the windows, but I can't see who the fuck it is. - You better do somethin'. You better do somethin' fast, man. - All right, I'm switching to thermo and I see three fuckin' guys in there. - Spook Show, gimme a pause. - [Thor] Khaleel's the one in the chair. He's got a gun to his head. - Thor, don't shoot the guy sitting down. - No! (shouts) - Fuck you. Go ahead. - Mire, finish him. - Fuck you! Go ahead! - (speaking foreign language) You are finished with this! - Come on! - Thor, do 'em. (gun blasting) (window shattering) (dark retro music) - The god of thunder strikes. (jar bashing) (Gula grunting) (shouting in foreign language) (gun pattering) (shells clinking) (intriguing retro music) (gun blasting) - Khaleel? Shit, some serious gore in here. Bravo! I don't see Khaleel. Has anyone picked him up? Go. Go! All right, cover all the exits now. - [Soldier] Copy. (gun pattering) Bad guy down. - [Frank] Rick, grab the tape. Get the hell outta there. - I'm movin' out now. I'm clearin' out. - This situation's going tactical. (intriguing retro music) (gun blasting) (gun pattering) (soldiers chattering) (blood spurting) Fall back! (gun blasting) Fuck this. We're outta here! Get outside. Set up a defensive perimeter. (intriguing retro music) (gun pattering) (gun pattering) (Khaleel grunting) (gun blasting) (gun pattering) I got him. I got the prime suspect. Positive ID. - [Rick] That's right, we got real casualties here. These fuckers are makin' a real fight of it. - Who the fuck are you? - I got him. I don't think he's gonna wanna give himself up though. (intriguing retro music) (gun blasting) (gun pattering) (gun blasting) (grunts) What the fuck you doin' there? Achmed, we're United States Military Force. (gun blasting) You're wanted by the Justice Department for illegal drug trafficking. - [Rick] Stumper, this is not the time to read him his rights. Neutralize the fucker. - Huh? What the fuck are you doing here? This is my country. - Goddammit, man. You tryin' to scare me to death? (gun blasting) - You'll give yourself up. (gun blasting) (gun pattering) (gun blasting) (?? grunting) - [Bigfoot] This is Bigfoot. Ironman's dead. - I got him. - [Bigfoot] His throat's been cut. - [Soldier] Frank, we're takin' casualties here, man. - I got him. He's right there. - [Soldier] (drowned out by gun), Skipper. This mission's cut the last man, come on. (gun pattering) We gotta get out of dodge. I mean now. - [Cowboy] This is Cowboy. He's comin' past. (guns pattering) (bullets pinging) (soldiers screaming) - [Soldier] Copy. We got problems. We got problems (drowned out by gun) comin' to life. I got bad guys everywhere. (gun pattering) (?? Screaming) (gun blasting) (gun pattering) (gun blasting) (guns pattering) - [Frank] All right, form up at the dry dock. We'll head to the extraction point. Cowboy, get Control on the radio. We need those choppers now! - [Cowboy] I heard that. (intriguing retro music) (gun blasting) (soldier grunting) (gun pattering) (gun blasting) - [Soldier] Frank, this is bad. I got another wounded out here. I keep stabilizing here. We're gonna move out now. (gun blasting) (gun pattering) (gun blasting) - [Soldier] I'll try to give you some time. (gun pattering) (gun blasting) - You, Americans. Your arrogance sickens me. You think you can come here and fuck with me and my country? You will learn! You will learn! (dark retro music) - Checkmate. - I let you win. - What a crock, Nicolai. Come on. - Oh no, no, no, no, no. I let you win. It is new policy directive of Polit Bureau. - Well I miss the old days when we used to play a hard game. - Rick Burns is here. - Who is he? - He's on my intelligence staff. He's gonna brief us. (dark retro music) Well what the hell happened? The agency promised me this guy's head on a platter. - Sir, what happened is we ran into some unexpected complications and we had to improvise. I believe you've seen the video tape. - I saw the goddamn video. I'm asking you for your version. - We had the suspect IDed. We were about to take him down. The situation just deteriorated very rapidly. I thought the suspect's life was in jeopardy. We had to make a move or lose him. - You made your move. You lost him. - Sir, Captain White decided- - Captain White, the loose cannon? - He's with Delta now. He was in command. - You were supposed to babysit this job. You're the old hen. How could you let this happen? - I was the intelligence officer. Captain White was the CO. And sir, he made the right decision. - So what happened is that you killed Khaleel's main rival and then allowed Khaleel to escape, thereby giving him the opportunity to amass even greater power? - See, any how you at it, it's a clusterfuck and that's how the president sees it. - This man is becoming quite a problem for us. We never had this drug problem in our country, not like yours. But now I feel it's our turn, especially now since our people want to engage in private enterprise. - Sir, we deserve another shot at this. We can take him. - I wish I had the power to make that decision. Thank you very much, Burns. - Yes, sir. - These cartels have become too powerful. They have in effect become a third superpower. Perhaps only together can we stop that. - I hear you, Nicolai, and I'm gonna pass it on. (dark military music) (soldiers shouting) (guns pattering) (gun blasting) (soldiers speaking in foreign language) (gun pattering) (gun blasting) (soldier speaking in foreign language) - How is your English? - Of course we must speak in English. It's a good day for airborne training, yes? - It's a proud day. - You have heard of my new ordinance, huh? But I have a new combat command. That is Stryker, an antidrug taskforce. Do you know where they tried to smuggle these filthy drugs in? - In Soviet Union of all places. - I've not been given my specific attack directives. - Don't worry. You shall be briefed at headquarters. - I hear I'll be forced to work with the American Special Forces. Do you know their commanding officer? - He is soft like all Americans. - Sir, do you think one becomes Delta Force Commanding Officer by being soft? - You surprise me. He has not been battle-hardened like us. - It was a very distasteful mission, Comrade. Forced to work with these Americans, the politicians make whores of us all. (dark retro music) - Everything okay, yes? - You worry much too much, my friend. - I'm still here because of my worrying. It takes balls of a bull to do this in the daytime, I think. - Why should we worry? We make people happy. (dark intriguing music) (dogs barking) It's the Moscow militia. (soldier speaking in foreign language) (gun pattering) (soldiers screaming) (dark intriguing music) (dogs barking) (clip clacking) (jet engines roaring) - Very touching. Well was he saying goodbye to his wife? - Just a friend. - Where'd you meet her, Bone? - Met her at the Admiral's cocktail party. - That was last night, wasn't it? - Hey buddy, you don't look too happy to see me. - That's 'cause I smell trouble, Rick. - Trouble, here's your orders. - This doesn't tell me shit. - We found Khaleel. He's resurfaced in Columbia. - Now you're talkin'. - Thought you'd like to know that. - Fuckin' A right I do. - Wait, we gotta get something straight. I know you took a lotta flack on your last op. - That's affirmative. - All right. If things always went according to plan, we wouldn't need guys like you, would we? - I lost some good men. - This is not a personal vendetta. In fact, your personal feelings don't even enter into the equation. - Look, Frank. They've given us another shot at this guy. We're gonna get to bring him in. - Khaleel has already got a major foothold in Columbia. Intel has IDed some very nasty characters he's hangin' out with. He intends to export his own brand of terrorism along the PLO model. Can't let that happen. You have to apprehend him, bring him back to stand trial in the United States' courtroom. - Sounds like a tough job. - White, I don't like your brand of soldier. But your name appeared at the top of a very short list to head this mission. There's nothing I can do about it. This time it's gotta be neat and discreet. After that last fiasco, the host government is gonna deny you any cooperation. So you gotta get in there and get outta there without anybody knowin' about it. And of course, our government is gonna deny any knowledge of the mission. - Of course. - Yes. - There's one other slight minor detail. - Oh great, what? - The president wants this to be a joint command taskforce. - Joint command with whom? - The Russians. - You gotta be kidding. - Look, Bone. The president showed him the video tape. Khaleel's gonna be just as big a problem for them as for us. They want him real bad. - How do you expect us to work with those bastards? - Is he questioning orders? Those orders are cut. - I've been preparing to fight the Russians my entire military career. - Tough shit. This is a very high level diplomatic problem. It's gonna require delicate statesmanship. You're just a foot soldier. - Gentlemen, I am tired of standin' here in the cold smoothin' feathers. Bone, this comes straight from the president. It's an election year. He's gotta have the PR. - Yeah, right. Well I don't like it. - The government pays your salary just like mine. We gotta do what we're told. This is round two. How often do you get a second chance at a target like Khaleel? Don't fuck it up. - (chuckles softly) Bone, you look like shit. Better get your team and get aboard. - There's no ship beyond the Enterprise. Our friend's in the fighter squadron. - Bone, you stay away from the airplanes. (intriguing retro music) (helicopter blades whirring) - [Operator] Come in, Russian Helio. This is USS Enterprise. We have you on approach. Vector in on two four niner. (jet engine roaring) (jet engine roaring) - [Commander] Clear the deck. Clear the deck. (intriguing retro music) Clear the deck. That means everyone on a restricted aircraft. Get that guy outta there. Bone, get outta there. - Hey, get outta there. Come on. - This isn't funny, Bone. You can't just borrow one of my aircraft. - [Frank] What's that, boss? I can't really read you. - [Commander] Bullshit, Bone. You hear me loud and clear. (pilot speaking in foreign language) (intriguing retro music) (helicopter blades whirring) - [Commander] All right, I'll clear you for takeoff. - [Frank] Roger that. - [Commander] When's the last time you checked out in one of these choppers, Bone? - [Frank] '79. - [Commander] Bone, you're lookin' a little shaky there. Hey, clear the island and leave, Bone. Oh crap, don't crash in the goddamn carrier. - [Frank] Nag, nag, nag. - [Commander] Okay, bring 'er around 120. - What? - Stop it, Bone. Right in front of ya. - Roger, bringin' 'er around 120. - [Commander] (drowned by poor quality), take it easy. Just don't get too close to the Russian, all right? Bring him in nice and easy. - [Frank] But still I'm givin' him an escort. - [Commander] This is gonna be both of our asses, Bone. All right, we got you on the radar. You look a little poor here, Bone. Don't mess around, Bone. - [Frank] You're breakin' up again. I can't really hear you. (intriguing retro music) (helicopter blades whirring) - [Commander] C'mon now, Bone. - What's with this aircraft? Gimme identification. - All right, I got him. - [Commander] Too damn close, Bone. - [Frank] Let's if Ivan knows how to play Chicken. - Why is this plane buzzing us? (intriguing retro music) (helicopter blades whirring) - [Pilot] Not much we can do. - [Commander] All right, come on back in. I'm ringing you. - [Frank] Let's hope I remember how to do this. - [Commander] Clear to land, Bone. - [Frank] Wish me luck. - [Commander] Captain White, Captain White. Report to the hangar deck. (intriguing retro music) - Sir, welcome to Starship Enterprise. - Yeah. Very funny, Captain. We have this stupid TV show in Soviet Union. Captain White, US Special Forces. - Colonel Kotchov, Spetsnaz detachment, Army of Soviet Socialist Republics. - Pleasure to meet you. May I say if I could extend any military courtesy, please allow me to do so. - Why were you buzzing my aircraft? - Sir, I thought I'd give you a personal escort to the ship. - Yes, you Americans are fond of games. Yes, but we have serious work ahead of us, yes? - That's true, sir. At 2230 hours, we'll start a nighttime scuba insertion. We're deployed to the coast by a Navy delivery vehicle. - A Navy delivery vehicle? - One of our subs. It's top secret. Not anymore. Anyway, when we hit that beach, the clock starts running. May I say, Colonel, it's a historic moment for both our governments? Looks like it'll be a real pleasure working with you. - Of course. Just don't get in my way. (intriguing retro music) (radar beeping) - Despite who stands first watch, two on, two off. All right, get settled in. Can the motherfuckers? - Shit, yeah. - Pretty nasty huh, Bobby? - Fuckin' size of these bugs. - Take some of this stuff. (dark intriguing music) (critters chittering) - What's up, Bone? - Noticed you're not hangin' with the Russian homeboys. - Well you remember how it was in Nam. - I surely do. - I watched your ass, you watched mine. - This ain't Nam, man. - Think any of those guys are gonna watch my ass? - I doubt it. - Which one's your weak link? - I don't have one. - Which one you think's gonna die? - I'd say you, man. You're the oldest, definitely the slowest. - Well that's why I don't need any friends - That's where you're wrong. - Only friend I need's AT&T. - [Frank] What kinda name for a rifle is that? - Well that's because I can reach out and touch somebody long distance. (dark intriguing music) (critters chittering) - I hope that's front toward enemy. - Yeah. - All right. - Thanks. Hey. - How are you? You know what to do tomorrow? - Yeah, no problem. I'm gonna waste those greasers. - The cartel's pretty organized. I don't want you overconfident. - Hey, I'm more worried about these fuckin' Russians back there and I don't know who to shoot first. - I don't like it any more than you do. The brass says we gotta cooperate. - Hey, fuck the brass. We should be fighting commies. - You gonna be a problem? - Hey, don't worry, Bone. - Gonna count on you. (dark intriguing music) (critters chittering) (leaves crunching) We didn't get a chance to talk about this. My ops orders are we're taking prisoners. - Of course. - Colonel, we're making arrests. - Yes. Of course, Captain. - A cigarette, Captain? - No thanks, I chew. All right, let's talk mission specifics. I figure my squad'll go in first. - No, Captain. Soviet forces go in first. - I disagree with you. - Captain, each man here is veteran from Afghanistan. When was the last time you have seen combat? Your men better suited for providing backup, blocking escape routes, provide reconnaissance like you did in your imperialist war against Iraq. - All right, we go up at 0400. I'll wake you up. - These Americans are so naive. - Maybe, Colonel. (intriguing retro music) (intriguing retro music) - Shit, I'm gettin' too old for this shit. - I heard that. - Hey, what were you and that crazy Ivan talkin' about last night? - We're tryin' to come up with some kinda op plan. - Come up with an op plan now? - That's right. - I thought that was already set. - Motherfucker changed it on me. He wants to split up our forces. They wanna go in and make the initial assault. We're supposed to provide cover and recon. - He's gonna make an assault? - Yeah, they're goin' and makin' the arrest. - Shit. I never heard of any Russian makin' an arrest. - That's what I'm worried about. Got another problem. - Mm-hmm. - Got the satellite photo. Match the grid up. - Mm-hmm? - There's the camp. They're comin' in from here. We're here. - Mm-hmm. - [Frank] What's that? - I don't know. - Looks like camo netting, doesn't it? - [Rick] Looks just like the other camp almost, smaller. We're split up like that. If shit hits the fan, they get in trouble, we can't do shit to help 'em. - I don't like it. - I don't like anything about this op. (guns pattering) (ATVs roaring) (gun pattering) (soldiers shouting in foreign language) (guns pattering) (bullets pinging) (soldiers shouting in foreign language) (civilian speaking in foreign language) (gun pattering) (bullets pinging) - Come on. I don't like it here. (intriguing retro music) (critters chittering) - This is good vantage point. We open fire on my mark. - But those were not our orders. - Shh, we open fire on my mark. - You heard Captain White. He said to take prisoners. - I do not care what this American says. Go. (soldier shouting in foreign language) (dark retro music) (RPG whooshing) (explosion bursting) (guns pattering) (bullets pinging) (soldiers shouting in foreign language) - Who is attacking us? - AK-47s, RPGs. - You idiot. That can mean half the world. Your trackers better be in position. It's time to spring the trap. And contact the Colombian army, it's time to get the protection we paid for. Go, do it! (guns pattering) (explosion bursting) (dark intriguing music) (guns pattering) (soldiers shouting in foreign language) (RPG whooshing) (explosion bursting) (soldier screaming) (RPG whooshing) (explosion bursting) (guns pattering) (bullets pinging) (explosion bursting) (guns pattering) - The fuck is goin' on, man? - Fuck if I know. - Is that your fuckin' Russians? - Sounds like AK fire in there. - You don't know what's goin' on, do you? - I sent Stumper to recon. Should've been back 20 minutes ago. - Listen, you better be pullin' somethin' outta your ass. This whole thing is goin' to shit. I'm dependin' on you, Bone. (Frank whistling) (gun blasting) - C'mon. Let's do it. (intense retro music) (guns pattering) (bullets pinging) (Ivan shouting) (gun pattering) (Ivan shouting) (dark retro music) - Check those bodies. There may be survivors. Major, assemble the men. We should go on that hill. - You fuckin' Ruskies don't mess around. You guys wasted everybody down here. - Sergeant! Of course we killed everybody. This is war. I want you to go on this point. Check for reinforcements. Do you got that? - Yeah. Fuck you. (fire crackling) (soft foreboding music) (ATV roaring) - Okay, this is working out better than I thought. Send in the mercenaries. The party's just beginning and send my personal chopper to come and get me. - [Soldier] Si, bueno. - Too bad I'm gonna miss the fun. - [Soldier] Okay, heavy. (dark retro music) (mercenary speaking in foreign language) - Comandante, what is the plan of attack now? (mercenary speaking in foreign language) - (speaks in foreign language) I want those sons of bitches. - Get the trackers. - Muy bien. (jeep puttering) (dark intriguing music) - We're here. Cap, check this out. - Fuckin' wasted everybody. - Shit's gonna hit the fan now. Let's DD outta here. - Come on. (dark intriguing music) - Movin'. - Move over here. Let's go, let's go. (dark military music) - Look out. (guns pattering) (bullets pinging) (gun blasting) (guns pattering) (soldiers chattering) (gun pattering) (mercenary shouting) (mercenaries chattering) (guns pattering) (gun blasting) (gun pattering) - How the fuck did these guys get the drop on us? - The Russians were supposed to clear the area. They took off in the fuckin' woods. Let's get outta here, Bones. Come on. (dark intriguing music) (guns pattering) (gun pattering) (shells clinking) (gun blasting) (gun pattering) - Hey, what is this? Cartel reinforcements. I posted that American as guard. Why did he not warn us? Come. Should make it to the extraction point. We'll be overrun in a moment. (speaks in foreign language) (guns pattering) (bullets pinging) (dark intriguing music) (mercenary chattering) (explosion bursting) (guns pattering) (guns pattering) (gun blasting) - Right over the ridge. (guns pattering) (bullets pinging) (dark intriguing music) (guns pattering) Go, go, go! (gun pattering) (jeeps rumbling) (mercenaries chattering) (guns pattering) (bullets pinging) (mercenaries speaking in foreign language) (water splashing) (dark retro music) (guns pattering) (RPG whooshing) (explosion bursting) - Come on! (mercenary speaking in foreign language) (gun pattering) - Keep moving! - Move, move! (dark retro music) (guns pattering) (soldiers shouting) - Let's get 'em. (grunts) In the jungle with me. - Bone! No! - You hit, man? - Yeah, yeah. - Where are ya hit? - I can't feel my fucking legs. - Where are ya hit? - I don't know. Can't move. - All right. - Can't move my goddamn leg. (Frank grunting) Shit, man. (gun pattering) (dark retro music) - [Frank] I'll get you outta here, man. - Bullshit, man. (winces) I can't feel anything. You know it. You know it, Bone. I'm history, man. - I'll get you outta here. - No! Oh fuck it, man. You can't get me outta here now. Look, you set me against a tree and then you DD. - Fuck you talkin' 'bout? I'm taking you with me. - No, you gotta get this guy. You gotta get this asshole. - [Frank] Yeah, I'll get him all right. - That's what this is all about. No, we need him alive. You want all this to go to waste for nothin'? Now you take him in just like you were supposed to. You fuckin' take him in. - What about you? - (chuckles) I'm fuckin' history. You just prop me up, all right? - [Frank] Take somethin' with ya. (grunts) - Okay. You just lift me up the fuckin' tree. (dark retro music) We American and you just DD out, man. (dark retro music) (gun cocking) (gun pattering) (mercenaries grunting) (gun pattering) (bullets pinging) (dark retro music) (guns pattering) (ATVs roaring) (dark retro music) (guns pattering) (gun blasting) (guns pattering) (ATVs roaring) (helicopter blades whirring) (mercenaries speaking in foreign language) (dark intriguing music) (guns pattering) (gun pattering) (tires screeching) - (sighs) Thanks, Ivan. - You are not worth saving. - American aircraft, do you hear me? (helicopter blades whirring) American aircraft, please answer me. - You pickin' this up? - Affirmative, but I can't ID him. Gimme his callsign. - We're Russian Spetsnaz. - There! - This is stupid. Get us outta here. - You called for extraction? Hello. - This is American frequency. - Yes, extraction on my coordinates. - Extraction? Put Captain White on or his RTO. - Do it now. We are under fire. - [Pilot] Repeat callsigns. - Just do what I tell you. We're under attack. - Roger that. Your LZ's too hot. Proceed to alternate LZ. We'll get you out. - Pussy! Captain, how is it that the escape routes were not blocked? Reinforcements slaughtered my men. - This op has been a clusterfuck since the word go. Stumper, what the hell happened? You were supposed to recon. You call for an extraction? - Yes, let's go. (helicopter blades whirring) (dark intriguing music) - I don't like it. I don't like it. (guns pattering) (explosion bursting) You gotta get this guy. You gotta get this asshole. - Cigarette, Captain? - Got you a call. Pentagon frequency. Here you go. - Colonel, what do you have to report? - The mission was not successful. We encountered resistance far greater than we expected. - That perp stop Soviet Army? How is this possible? - They're well-organized and well-armed. We should not underestimate Khaleel as an opponent. He must be tied to his International Terrorist Network. - You idiot. You had him. - We suffered many casualties, especially the Americans. - Why have you let him slip through your fingers again? You will catch him or we are both finished. Is this clear? - Yes, generale. - Fight him, destroy anything that gets in your way. - We will find this jackal. (helicopter blades whirring) - So what is your problem? - My men. I lost half my command. Yes, well what did you expect? What you don't realize is that this is war and we are not fighting soldiers. We are fighting drug scum. These terrorists, they poison our societies. And the only way to stop them is to be as cruel and as ruthless as them. - We got laws in my country. Criminals have certain rights. - Ah yes, Mr. American with your quaint Anglo-Saxon values of fair play. But I tell you they are quite out of place in this new kind of war. - [Pilot] We're patched into Washington, Captain. It's Secretary Reed. - Thanks. - Captain White? Captain White, gimme a sitrep. - An emergency extraction, sir. (fingers snapping) I fuckin' didn't get any of my people out alive. - Did you take casualties, sir? - I lost six good men. I had to leave 'em. - You left bodies. I told you not to fuck up, Captain. Somebody's got to hang for this fiasco. - Well blame the Russians. I can't work with these guys. Their idea of precision tactics are to go in there and slaughter everybody. - Well that's exactly what happened. The Colombian government is spreading it all over the international press. Some of the cartel managed ways to remove mine and Colombian Army officers. They've got to be accounted for somehow. They're calling this an American invasion. Congress is gonna be up our ass. I don't have to tell you how unhappy this makes the president and he is looking for a sacrificial lamb. They're all in your chopper to rendezvous with a Russian cruiser heading for Cuba. They arranged the pickup for you at Guantanamo Bay. As of 1800 hours, you're relieved of duty. I gotta be honest you. Right now, it looks as though you're gonna be facing court martial charges when you set foot in the States. - Sounds like the politicians are looking for a scapegoat. You got the wrong man, sir. - That's what all Ollie North said. (group chuckling) - Yeah, very funny. - There is a way outta this. Of course there is the possibility you could miss your rendezvous and I can't sanction this officially. But since you don't exist, (paper crumpling) you got it? - Sounds like I'm fucked. - Erase that. (dark intriguing music) - Captain, there's a transport waiting when the Soviet ship docks in Cuba. Hae you ever been to Russia? (dark military music) (helicopter blades whirring) - [Pilot] There's the Russian cruiser. I hope they have seating placed on the helipad. (dark intriguing music) - Welcome. Oh, those bunks on the left. They are for you and your men. I know you will be comfortable here. This is Soviet Special Forces training center. - You gotta be kidding, Cap. This place is a shithole. - Yeah, it sure ain't Fort Bragg. - Look at them. These Americans are such babies. - All I want is a beer, all right? Where's the bar? - This is a change for you men. Perhaps this is good. Perhaps this is what you need. Your men bond here. - Guys, stow your gear and shut up. - Colonel, you can not really expect us to work with these men. - Shh! Comrade, expect you of all people to understand that their orders come from somewhere higher up. You cannot question them. Besides, I think these Americans may show us something yet. (soft foreboding music) - [Mercenary] Khaleel, I have the (speaks faintly). (speaks in foreign language) Steal faster. - Very good. Have him wait in my gun room. (soft intriguing music) Ah, very good. Very good. Welcome. Some wine, cocaine? - No, I'm a soldier. - You should enjoy yourself. Life is very short. Come. Come. I want to show you something. Step inside. (soft foreboding music) I estimate our losses in the South American debacle to be 25% of our adjusted gross. 25% of our adjusted gross is a major setback. I ask you how could such a thing happen? - It won't happen again. There must've been an informant or a lucky satellite pass. I don't know. - Do you think I would kill you? (soft foreboding music) I could not kill you, my friend. But I can tell you I once trusted you. Trusted you with my life. I must tell you one of my dreams. This morning, I woke with a vision. I bet a jackal with my right hand while he gnaws at my left. And in my dream, I could not kill it. In my dream, I couldn't kill it. (dark retro music) (gun blasting) (rhythmic romantic music) - No, Captain White. She has never lost and she always has her way. Estonia!

Lights. First slide please. This is Khaleel. He's a sociopath, total sociopath. We don't know, but we think he's a user. Next slide. (soft foreboding music) - I'm sorry. This is a restricted area. - Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't realize that. - I'm serious. You'll have to leave. (gun blasting) (dark intriguing music) - He has the financing to buy any weapon anywhere, anytime. Next slide. (keypad beeping) - Yeah, I'm in the building. - Good. You know what to do. (dark intriguing music) - We missed him by 20 minutes. At Dade County, he was arraigned and with a false name, he walked out. - I have to be with you soon, Khaleel. - I'm there with you. Do not fail me. (dark intriguing music) - He's an arrogant son of a bitch and we're gonna bring him down. (gun pattering) (bullets pinging) Hey!

Come here. - Thanks. - You wanna play, komroski? - Yeah, c'mon. Join the boys. - C'mon. Come join. - Okay, Comrade. You in? - Guess not. - I call. - All right, lets see your hands, gentlemen. - I got a pair. - Three 5s. - Hmm. - [Group] Oh. - Five in a row, huh? - Whoa, wait a minute. Got your five in a row. - Yeah, you got the ace. He's got the ace. - So you got five in a row. So I got the trader card, see? And I can make an exchange now, see? 'Cause I got an ace. - Right. So you got a 10. Full house? - I got a full house. - And a full house beats a straight. - Right. - No, seriously. - He got the 10. - Yeah. - Five cards. - Yeah, you see. One, two, three, four, five. So you gotta have the ace. - Five in a row. I have five. - They're trader cards. So I get it. Got a full house, all right? - We do it all the time this way. - Take it from me, I know the game. - Really do. You'll win it back. You'll win it back. Come on. (soft foreboding music) (group chattering) - What is going on in there? - Oh nothing. Our men are about to kill each other, that's about it. - Good. They should be fighting for real very soon. Here. I may have information as to the whereabouts of Khaleel. - Go on. - One of his operatives has been spotted in Prague. - Is the KGB gonna take care of it? - No. The Soviet Union cooperation is expensive. Shall take care of this matter ourselves. - Go undercover? - Yes. The Soviet Army officer will be most unwelcomed in Czechoslovakia. We must not be caught. (dark foreboding music) (businesman wincing) - This man was afraid of opportunity. He tried to hinder our ventures. (dark retro music) I commend you, you free enterprisers. How you managed to do business in a socialist economy is beyond me. (dark retro music) (businessmen speaking in foreign language) (gun blasting) (Khaleel speaking in foreign language) - You're all petty thieves. Listen to me. I offer you an opportunity. You're all quarreling like women. I offer you untold riches! Listen to me. I know. I know. (dark intriguing music) - Whoa. - Mr. Callahan. (both speaking in foreign language) (Callahan coughing) (Ivan speaking in foreign language) (gun pattering) - Somebody blew it. (guns cocking) - Where they at? - You go high. (dark intriguing music) - (speaks in foreign language) Find them and kill them.
