In nature, a watering hole is like a local tavern or pub. Sooner or later, residents from all over the neighborhood end up there. Most come to drink. Others to hunt. Some are just passing through. And others come to linger. This is the story of one particular watering hole in downtown Manhattan.

I say, "All right, how black?" He goes, "She looks Spanish or Italian". I say "Fuck it, bring her over". So anyway, he shows up with this girl, right? She is black as night. Nobody says nothing through the whole dinner, you know? You know me Sal, I'm not prejudiced. I don't give a shit what people are. Just pissed he fucking lied to me. Russell! Burnzy! Sally! Uh oh, here we go. I dream of Genie with the pomade hair. Sally, can I buy these boys a delicious cocktail? Having an early lunch, Russell? No, a late breakfast, following through to lunch. I'll have a Dewars and soda.. Yeah. All right. How much? I've been a CPA, that's a Certified Public Accountant, for over 20 years now, and I just can't imagine how the guy does it. I deal with numbers all day long, but once I'm done, that's it. It all washes away, with a little help. Well, it takes a special kind of guy to be a bookie who don't use paper. It's a gift. Eugene is gifted. -Shut the fuck up! No, not you, asshole. - Good afternoon. May I have a very, very dry Tanqueray martini, May I have a very, very dry Tanqueray martini, straight up. Two olives and just wave the Vermouth And may I also have some water? Pepe little man, what's wrong? You're not paying attention. Sit. Now you're paying attention. Sal. How can you stand her? That rat dog on the bar. - So I let her bring her dog in, what's the big deal? She's out of her mind. And you got a clean bill of mental health Eugene? You're a softie Sal. Patience of a saint. What do you care, Gene? She don't bother nobody. Unlike yourself. - You know, you should think about changing your lifestyle a little. Smokin, drinkin. Think about a career change. You could lose a few pounds. - I do all right. I'm gonna get my weight down when I was in the service. - You was in the service? - Hell yeah. - Coast Guard. - The Coast Guard? (men laughing) - Fuck you. What the fuck do you guys do huh? What the fuck have you ever do huh? Goddam coast kept you safe. You didn't even know it man. - I did four years in the Air Force and two years in the north motherfucking pole. - No way. - Hell yes. 57 to 59. I counted every fucking day. They sent all the bad niggers and fuck ups to the north pole The great white north with little black dots. Man you never seen cats more out of place than them brothers up there. The weather is for you snow monkeys. Black man is made for the equator. (men laughing) (blues guitar music) - Hey Burnzy, Sal. I take a Finlandia martini straight up, better yet just throw it on me and light a match. Burnzy get ready to call 911, this is gonna be front page suicide. How do you like that Sal? Your bar all over the cover of the Post. Cop Snaps - Torches Himself in Gin Mill. (Burnzy laughing) You know, forget the martini, I'll just take a beer. And put a collar on it, I want a little foam on my nose. So I get a call for cardiac arrest over at the karate school on Lafayette. I get there before the EMS guys. There's a guy turned blue. Now he's alive, he's awake, but he's had a heart attack. You know, he's talking, he's a young guy, he's my age. So the EMS guys show up. Now there's this one asshole EMS guy. I mean, he's a bodybuilder, you know, with the short hair and a ponytail, you know what I mean? A real freak. So he's talking to the blue guy, the guy's got an irregular heartbeat. So the EMS guy takes out the paddles to start to give them a shock. I said, "Wait a minute, you can't shock him." "This guy's awake." "Aren't you to suppose to do that" "only if you don't got a pulse?" So the ponytail says, "He's got an irregular heartbeat." "This will help straighten it out and it's procedure "so back off". Everybody backs off. They give him a shot with the paddles and bang he's fucking dead. - Jesus Christ. - Bang, they hit them again. Again, again. Now the bodybuilder's sweating, 'cause he's fucked up big time and I'm standing right there. So I had to radio his supervisor. Think this guy is whacked on steroids. - Jesus Christ, that stupid bastard. - I think it's crazy anyone who would wanna live here, instead of the country. - Well then again, serial killers all live in the country. You live next to a guy. He looks normal driving his pickup. His front lawn is all manicured. Next thing you know, he's in the news. There's 20 little kids buried under his house. You know what I mean? Now that could never happen in New York. - You're absolutely right Burnzy. - Get out of here. - No, I'm serious, you know why? 'Cause we have Supers. The building Supers are so fucking nosy. The first body you got rid of they’d turn you in. Sniffing around the garbage. Hey there's body parts in that hefty bag. Looks like it's from 3F. Call the cops. - Get the fuck out of here. - Believe me the real freaks live out in the country. - Well I gotta clock out now. ( rhythm and blues guitar music ) How you doing? - What's your name? - Sal. - Sal? (everyone laughing) My name is Gertrude. - Gertrude. - Could I get you something Gertrude? - Yes please. Cappuccino please. - Sure. Coming right up. You want cinnamon or chocolate on that? - Cinnamon. Could I have a Coca-Cola too please? (speaking in a foreign language) (speaking in a foreign language) Can I have a beer also please? (rhythm and blues music) (speaking in a foreign language) - I knew it was too good to be true. - I don't care. I'm in love with her, warts and all. (speaking in a foreign language) (rhythm and blues music) - Sal? (laughing) Sal. I have to be leaving now. (rhythm and blues music) - So I says to her don't you eva, eva put your friggin hands on him again. - She is such a pig. - Ladies. - I'll have a vodka diet Coke. - I don't know what I want, make hers first, I got to think about it. - God, you never know what you want. - So I'm careful. - Order a drink, put a condom on it. We're paying separate. - I'll have a Bay Breeze. - Don't make them. - You can't make me a Bay Breeze? - I don't have any pineapple. - All right, I'll have a Pina Colada. - [Sal] Nope. - You know how to make a sex on the beach Sal? -hmmmm OK. Give me a draft, light. - All of that for a beer? Are you going to do this at Club Med? 'Cause let me tell you, if you try to pull this at Club Med, this is how far you're gonna get with me. - This guy is sitting in this joint and this babe walks in, sits right across from him. He buys her a drink, they talk. He says, "My wife doesn't like having sex with me. "She thinks I'm too kinky". So the babe says, "Wow what a coincidence", "My husband thinks I'm too kinky too. "We never have sex anymore. "I'm just dying to have some". He says, "Great, let's go back to your place" So they go back to her place, he's laying on her bed. She says, "I'll be back in a minute". So she goes into the bathroom, she puts on all this leather gear, handcuffs, a bullwhip, high heels, everything right? She comes out of the bathroom and the guy's dressed. She says, "How come you're dressed?" He goes, "Hey, I just fucked your poodle, "shit in your pocket book and I'm outta here". - He met some slut at a bar on the East side and he goes home to her place and they're laying around drinking wine and he sees she's got a fireplace. So to make it more romantic, he goes out to buy some firewood at the Koreans around the corner. Something he would never do for me, of course, but for one night with some whore, he goes out to get the firewood. He's a little drunk. He starts back to her apartment, ready to set the mood. And he can't remember what apartment building. - It serves him right. - So wait, that's not all. He came over to my apartment, drunk and stunned with an armful of firewood. I don't have a fireplace. He was in shock. (friend laughing) Wouldn't let go of the wood. (men laughing) - You got the hockey game on? - There's no hockey on now. - Channel 21 my friend, exhibition match. Bruins versus the Ruskies. - You're betting on exhibition hockey? - Start me a tab will ya? - No tabs. - Sal, Sal, more ice over here, I wanna cut a deal with you. We come in right? Bring in the boys. Have a few drinks, have a good time. Then, you know, I put a C note on the bar. Everything's taken care of. You do what you want with it, boss doesn't have to know, everybody's happy. - Can't do it Minsk. - What's the matter? Make it up as you go along. - I do that anyway. - This is why Minsky is the big bucks guy that he is. He hustles bartenders, old ladies. Cripples. - Think about it Sal. Think about it. (hockey game announcers) -Shit. - Man I got a yard on this with Eugene, I'm fucked if this goes under. No, no, no, no. Unbelievable. No. Time is on my side. This is Luke we're talking about. Luke, does not go down easy. - Hockey stinks on ice. - Life is a lot like hockey. It's like you watch them fight and scramble around for this puck that nobody can see half the time. It's fast like life. It happens and you don't see it coming. You fight like crazy, hustling and bang, checked against the boards. Woof, stick in the ribs, goal. It's very fast, very violent and very exciting. - And very stupid. Baseball pally. A gentleman's game with a history. Baseball. - Baseball's for pussies, it's boring. (hockey game announcers) - Shit. It's over. Hey man, you are one of my bad luck charm. Sal, if Eugene shows up, you haven't seen me, okay? - You were never here. - And you didn't see me neither. - What makes you think I care? - I'll catch you next time, Sal, okay? - Yeah right. - Tight wad. 50 cents. Now you'll be able to buy that newspaper you always wanted Sal. That guy is no good, no good. It’s like water off a duck's back.

I'm trying to make you some money. Stock is not something that you're gonna lose your money. It's there. It's a piece of fucking paper. It's a, what's a metaphor?

You got a whole fucking garden. Now let me tell you. - What's you say? You said three months. - The Hong Kong thing. I gave him the Hong Kong railroad. You got how many fucking Chinese are there?

Those guys are pretty scary. - It's the hair club for men. (Jackie laughing) - So what else do you do besides tend bar? Are you an actor or musician? - This is it. - Well that's OK. I ah.. I didn't mean to... - You don't have to do anything else. It's just, you know, when I was doing it, I couldn't wait to get out, the people, the hours, the booze, you know? The money's good, but you really earn it. I'm waiting for a friend I haven't seen in a long time, I'm nervous. - Two shots of Jagermeister please. - [Minsky] Three months. - Hold on, hold on. Shh shh. - You got your money. Do me a favor, don't sell this stock. Leave it. I am gonna make you so much fucking, you wanna take a flyer? - What have you got? - All right. I got a stock.

They're building a pipeline from fucking Toronto all the way across Canada. Now look, you read the papers, California's in shit. The whole fucking state, riots, earthquakes. - Fires. - Fires, droughts, The whole thing. It's an energy crisis. What they're gonna do is they're gonna start shipping natural gas from Canada. They're gonna fucking fund the whole energy of California on this one gas line. I got at $5. It's a, what is it, $5? - Five dollars? - Five fifty.. I guarantee in a year it's gonna be $20. I'm putting what, 30,000? What did you put in? - You sold your co-op. - I sold my fucking co-op. Look, I'll tell you something right now. When the broker puts his own money in, you know, it's a fucking sure deal. - We go to school at NYU and live at the dorms over there. - College boys. What are you studying to be bankers? - No, no, film. - Film? - What kind of jobs can you get from the film? You will run a one hour a photo? - No. We make movies. - So you going to be movie stars huh? Like Victor Mature? - No directors. - I aint been to the movies in a while, used to go all the time, Westerns mostly. Go see the Duke. Hank Fonda. In My Darling Clementine. - John Ford. - Huh? - He directed it, John Ford. - Oh yeah? Well what do you know, I didn't know that. I guess school pays off huh? - This place has a story on every stool. You take that stoll you're sitting on, Now that's the stool where Sniffy Barnes keeled over and died after one drink. Last drink. Now here's a guy who's a no good souse all his life. Every day he'd drink a rot gut whiskey and beer, day in and day out. So finally he gets religion and he starts to stop drinking. For six months, he goes to church. He's good to his wife and kids, puts on clean clothes, shows up at work on time. One night, we come down here and he decides he wants to go with us, but he's not drinking. Just tomato juice. So we have a few and he's starting to sweat. We ain't paying much attention, drinking our beers. So he figures, I'll have a Bloody Mary. What the hell, it aint the rot gut stuff he's used to drinking. And he won't even taste the vodka. So the bartender sets him up, knocks back the Bloody Mary and whammo. He hits the floor like a ton of bricks, stone dead, massive coronary or something. - Whoa. Man. - That's what they say, but you know what I think killed Sniffy Barnes? - What? - The quota. - The quota? - Everybody's got a quota as to how many drinks you can have in a lifetime. Sniffy Barnes drank his quota. If he'd stayed in the straight narrow, he'd probably be alive today. He just had one drink over the line. - What about your quota? - Well that's why I have short beers. Chipping away. Takes longer. Guys like Sniffy are pigs, drinking up as much as they can. Not knowing how close they're getting. I think I just have a little time yet. But you never know. - Think about it. Think about it. I wanna make you some money, but think about it. - How much? - Think about it. Think about it. - How much? Well, how much? - I don't know. I'd put in 20 at least. - I'll put three. - Three? - Put in five, come on, write out a check. I wanna make you some money, I feel bad. - You got a pen? You fucking children are gonna thank me. Just write out for five thousand dollars I'm gonna quadruple your fucking money. - How does this thing work? 5,000 in three months, I guarantee you're going to have $20,000 and then you're going to be coming here and you're gonna be buying me drinks from Mr fucking personality. What's $5,000 to you? - $5000 to me? - You're going to make a lot of money. I'm kidding you man. Don't ever lose your sense of humor Minsky, okay? Come on, I'm gonna make you a lot of money. I promise. - Trust him. - Trust me Minsky. I'm gonna make you money. All right, take it easy. [Minsky] You make me sick. I'm going to make your money you bald headed, cock sucking Jew. Oh. - Who from? - The hair club president. - A note too, getting kind of high school around here. If your date don't show, I could fill in for him? Tell him thanks but no thanks. - So what'd she say? - She said, "Thanks but no thanks". - Stuck up bitch, fuck her. Fuck her. - You're a smooth Minsky. Why don't you show her your money clip? - Sal, give her this, give her this. - Why don't you take the hint Minsk? - Give her this, give her this. - Why don't you give it to yourself? - Cause it's Sal's job. - Go to the fucking post office. Does he look like a fucking post man? He's a bartender. - Oh really? Then can we have another round bartender? - Burnzy. - What's the matter Francis, what's the matter? Just calm down and tell me. - Them kids pushed me. My bike's gone now with all my stuff. - All right, don't worry Francis, we'll get the bike back. Sal would you do me a favor? - Ahh, my Holy Bible, my eight ball juice! - Eight ball juice? - Yes eight ball juice. It's inside the eight, you know, future unclear, try again. - Oh, I know what he's talking about. I had one, an eight ball of course, you ask it your future. I had one in high school. - Yeah no eight ball juice. It's just a juice. - Me and Larry will look for it. - We will? - What you're too busy drinking beer. You can't help this guy out? - All right. What color is it? - It's a beautiful blue bike. - That's right. You can't miss it. It's a big blue tricycle and it's got reflectors and bumper stickers and there's a big tool box in the back where he keeps all his stuff. - Wait a minute. What if these guys still got it? - We take it back, what are you chickening out? - I'm just not sure I want to be this involved. Shouldn't we let the cops handle it? - So somebody robs a handicap guy and you've got a question in your head as to whether or not you want to be involved? Come on. - Now, Francis, these boys are gonna look for your bike. Okay? Now you and I will stay here until your sister comes and they're gonna find it all right? - Thank you boys. - We're on the job. You gotta promise to give us a ride, if we find it. - High and low the search begins, all right? -Good luck fellas. - Bartender. I'll have a Lillet of the rocks please, with a slice of orange. - That's disgusting. - Oh please. I don't bite. - Knock that off okay pal? This ain't the kind of joint. - Oh, what kind of joint is it? - It's a man's joint. - Well then I'm in the right place, I'm enjoying my drinks in a good companies of mens. - Doesn't it break your mother's heart to see you dressed like that? - Honey, my mother showed me how to dress like this. So don't you be casting no aspersions on my mother. I grew up in South Philly and I'm man enough to whip any man's ass who talks trash that includes my mama. - Take it easy lady. Take it easy. It's a free country. You wanna dress like a girl, dress like a girl, all right? No skin off my ass. - And a skinny ass at that.

I hope he hasn't been a problem. - No problem at all. - He gets harder to keep track of as he gets older, you're going to be awake all night, drinking those sodas. What were you doing out so late? You're supposed to come home after work. You missed your favorite program. - Oh Police Blotter! Ah! - He gets around on that bike. I worry about him, he's such a target. I get reports of him being up past 14th street. - I can't believe that anybody would bother him. It's not like that bike was valuable to them. - To tell the truth, I'm kind of glad it's gone. He's so hard to keep track of. - Some kids went to look for it. - What am I gonna do with you? Let's go home. Maybe those boys will find your bike. - Yeah. - Thanks again. - It was nice meeting you Francis. When I'm in town, I'll do my shopping at Slovaks. Maybe I'll see you? - On Police Blotter. - Let's hope not. - Jesus Christ Burnzy, you're still here. - I'm still here? What the hell you doing here? - I go down to the station house, I'm just about to punch my card, when a detective from homicide start grilling me. So he asked me if I happen to know a bookie on my beat, by the name of fat Eugene Fisher. I said, "No, I don't know any bookie named Eugene". Then it hits me. Wait a minute. That stiff over at the karate school I was talking about, that's the guy. - Eugene? - What, you know him? - Oh Jesus. He was here this morning. - Wait a minute. There's a bookie hangs out here, and you guys don't tell me nothing? - [Burnzy] We can't rat the guy out. - Yeah well, he was working as a snitch for the detective. Well don't matter now, it all died with him. That EMS knucklehead shot the life right out him. - Oh Jesus Christ. Well, here's to fat Eugene. Well, here's to fat Eugene. You're a jerk, and a chisler and a snitch. God help you anyway. Here here. (glasses clinking) - Cheers. - Fuck him. - Hey Sal, did you hear? - Luke. - Jackie, how long have you been here? - Since 7 o'clock. Since the time you were supposed to meet me. - Oh Jackie, I can explain. I'm so sorry. - This is just the guy you were waiting for? - Not you again. Don't you ever go home? - Yeah I can't believe it either Burnzy. See what I mean Sal? What is wrong with me? - Really, Jackie, I can explain. Don't be mad. A lot has happened tonight, that you just wouldn't understand. Come on let's go somewhere and get a bite to eat. I can explain over dinner. - It's a little late, I think I understand you pretty well. A lot can happen in one night. I was just on my way home, thank you. I have a plane to catch in the morning and it's been a very long day. - Stay for one drink, I'm flush. I hit it big today, my big break. Hey Sal, set everybody up. - I'm going home. Goodnight Burnzy. Night Sal. - Hey, wait a minute, Jackie. You don't understand. Would you listen to me please? See, I was into this guy for a lot of money. I was in serious danger of having broken kneecaps. As it turns out, Eugene didn't keep any books or marks. He kept it all in his head. So my debt died with Eugene. That was like a gift from God, taking Eugene out. - Gift from God. Thanks Sal. Call me sometime. - I think your luck is changing. - Give me a Stoli rocks Sal. - You know, kid life is a lot like hockey, fast, unpredictable, you never see it coming. Very exciting. - Go home old man. - Why don't you quit while you're ahead? - One thing I never do, is let a babe spoil a hot streak. Another one Sal. - You know, you're dumber than you look pally, letting a lady like that wait around. That's a lucky break, you ain't getting again. - What's with you, man? Is this your job here or something, handing out free advice? I mean you think because you're old, you got the right to run everybody down with your tired old philosophy huh? I mean, if you're so God damn smart, why don't you kicking back in some estate in Bermuda, huh? Why aren't you the president? You think just because you managed to live this long and not get croaked that you deserve a medal? Huh It's no wonder, it can't be much risk sitting in one place the whole time. - You'd be surprised. - It is all about risk, it's chance. I'm not sitting around waiting for death to come, I'm going to be out there face first and if I go down in flames, that's the chance you take and Luke does not go down easy my friend, no. I got a hot streak going and I'm wasting it here talking to you. - Well you better get going on that hot streak. Wouldn't wanna see you burst into flames right here. - Here you go Sal. Hey, thanks. I told you I'd get you next time. Hey, don't go nowhere old man, you still got some time left. Yeah what about it? It's my birthday. -[Sal] Burnzy. Last call. Yeah I didn't think I'd be closing up the joint. Haven't done that in years, not since, Ah never mind. - Did you say it's your birthday? - Yeah it's my birthday. - Happy birthday. Why don't you say something? - Come on Sal, I'm 75. Why would I? The last time I had a really happy birthday was, 65 years ago. I'll never forget it. My brother took me to the Polo Grounds, to see the Giants play. That game was amazing. Giants lost, but I didn't care. My brother saved up milk bottle caps for three months and got two free tickets to take me to see the Giants. What a guy and he was tough too. After the game we were walking home and we decided to go to the Tarzan place where all the kids hang out. It's just outside of the stadium in a deep gully by the Harlem River. It was a perfect summer night. I can smell it. And all the kids were swinging around on the rope doing the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan call, the original, not the phony stuff you got now. And each kid was taking a turn and I was like the youngest guy there. (Burnzy laughing) And there were a couple of creeps with slingshots dressed like sports hanging around there. So, my turn comes and I swing as hard as I can, 'cause I want to show those other kids, I may be small, but I'm tough too and just as I get to the peak, whack, a rock from a slingshot, right in my back. I fall off the knot on the rope and I hit the ground. And my brother's right there. He shouts up at these sports, standing over us on the hill and he says, "Who did that?" I'm crying and crying. And the biggest guy in the group, he looked like Dutch Shultz or something. He's standing there with a sling shot and he says, "Me, what about it?" And my brother starts up that hill. I can see it still his hands, his fingers puffed up into fists and he walks right up to that guy, bam, whack, bang. (Burnzy laughing) Everybody is stunned. He beats the crap out of that guy. And the wise guy's friends won't even help him. They're in shock. He's getting such a whipping. (Burnzy laughing) Ah yeah. My brother didn't take crap from nobody. He was a hell of a guy. Ain't it amazing? You take a guy like Eugene. I mean, nobody gives a shit that he's dead. He ain't dead 24 hours and people are happy he's gone. You know I thought that when you go, I mean you know. Don't mind me, I'm just a little. Just give me my tab Sally. - No tab Burnzy, happy birthday. - Oh no.. its.. Thanks. Well, better get to bed. Just another guy crying in his beer. (Burnzy chuckling) See you tomorrow. - You gonna be okay Burnzy? - I'm okay, I'm okay. Beat that quota one more day. Happy birthday.
