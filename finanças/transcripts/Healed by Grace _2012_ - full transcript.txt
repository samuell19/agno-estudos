- I think it's nuts. It ain't a hospital, it's a training facility. - It's just therapy with the horse, that's all. - So what's wrong with this kid anyway? - She's physically challenged. - Right. Challenged? That's what they call it. Everybody's challenged. Mentally challenged, physically challenged, emotionally challenged. I got 35 stalls to clean, and now I gotta babysit a cripple, right? I'll tell you who's challenged. Me. I'm challenged. - You'll never ever know she's here, Gauff. Okay? I promise. - Yeah, right. I'll bet. Kid can't walk and she's gonna ride Gerard? I don't like it. It's like a bad movie. - It's just therapy, Gauff. I ran it by uncle bill. He said - your uncle bill ain't here every day. That's what he pays me for. He's got businesses to run. But me, these horses are like my kids. It's what I do. Somebody's gonna get hurt. - Gauff, I promise. I'll take full responsibility, all right? - One slip, Casey. One stall left unlatched, one saddle out of place, I'll shut it down. You understand me? - Thanks, gauff. You're the best. - Right. - Hey Monica? - Yeah, Riley. - Can I get going? I'm gonna be late for class. - Tell you what, you take Ralph his cheesecake, then you can get going. - You think he'd notice if I took a bite? - I think he might. - It's tempting. All right. Well, I gotta go. See you, Monica. Thanks. Here you go, Ralph. - Bless you. Thank you.

Mass wasting processes thus began to become... ...relatively more important than they were before. Steeper cliffs... Further widening the grand canyon and its tributary... ...grand canyon system occurred. - Find your seat. Continue, Brandon. - Okay. On average, reach the Colorado river, the smaller side canyons, excavate the larger canyons. Uh that’s about it. - Miss Adams? Riley Adams. - State your topic. - I'm going to discuss how the sudden appearance of life forms in the geologic strata coincide perfectly with the projected timeframe of the great flood. - Let me guess, miss Adams. Noah's flood? - Right. The great flood. The biggy. - Here we go again. - All right, Riley. You have five minutes. - What are sedimentary layers? Yep. That's me. Riley Adams. College sophomore, devoted daughter, dancer. Chronically late. - Or because of over millions of years ...bible thumper. That's Aleah Adams. Yeah. Aleah Adams. What are the odds of that? Both 19 years old, both dancers, same last name, and no relation whatsoever. She's hated me since grade school. And she's never late. Living proof that god has a sense of humor. - Why not a worldwide flood? - Well, that's all we have time for today. We'll finish the presentations next Wednesday. Expect a quiz Monday over pages 87 through 123. And pick up a copy of your term paper assignments on the way out. - Tomorrow, you dance in front of one of the premiere judges on this planet. And believe you me, Dimitri stone will not cut you any slack. It's gonna take energy, passion and focus. How long you been dancing? - Eight years. - Eight years. Some of you 10, 11 years. Some of you dream of making dance your career. And you can. I have. But do you want to teach dance, or do you want to dance? This is it. You get one shot. One shot at something that you've worked for more than half your natural lives. Do you want it? Do you want it? - Yes. - All right. That's what I wanted to hear. - Hey, sorry I'm late, lexis. - Find your spot, Riley. - So, are you and Brandon going steady now? He's quite the catch. - Riley, you have a boyfriend? That is so cute! - Are we good? - We're good. - Okay. Group hip hop from the top. - all right. I like what I see. That's it. Everybody back here 6:00 sharp. Except Riley and Aleah. - Riley, don't forget to bring a picture of your boyfriend tomorrow. - Lily, I - you two are my soloists this year. I expect you to show leadership and give it everything you've got. You're first. Show me what you've got. - not too bad. Aleah, you're up. - Aleah, you're looking hungry, looking sharp. I like it. How do you both feel? - Ready to take first. - You? - Pretty good. I think I could do better though. - When you're in front of Dimitri stone, 80 percent won't cut it. This is gonna feel more like a final exam than a recital. There's no cheering audience to feed off of. It's just you and the judges. So you really think you can give me more? All right. Let's run it again. Aleah, I'll see you tomorrow. - Break a leg. - Thanks. - Take your position. Ready to go? - what was that? - It must have been a wet spot. - Where does it hurt? - Hamstring. I don't think it's bad though. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay, ice that tonight. I want to make sure you're ready to win tomorrow. - In your dreams. - Hey, looking good. - So you gonna be okay for the recital? - Dad, it's not a recital. It's the regional qualifier. - Right. That's what I meant. Sounds exciting. Did you want cheese? - No. - So, am I going? - No. You'd be bored. It's like a private review just you and the judge. - Wow, that sounds well, you're probably right. It sounds boring. - Yeah, the judge, he's like the toughest big shot. He's like the Simon Cowell of dance. - And you say you're doing this voluntarily? - Dad, if I win this, I'm one step away from being a professional dancer. - It sounds like I'm one step away from empty nest syndrome. - Thank you. - Ah-ah. - Sorry. - Father, thank you for this food, and thanks for sending Jesus, your son, to die so that we can be forgiven for all that we do that offends you, lord. Amen. - Amen. And thank you for the stuff you teach us through your word. - Double amen. So, what have you been reading exactly? - Pray for your enemies. - Oh, that's a toughy. Any enemy in particular? - You have to ask? - Oh, yeah. Well, you just keep praying for Aleah. You have no idea what god's doing behind the scenes. - I've been praying for Aleah since grade school. God needs to get busy. - Honey, it took Abraham years before he saw the promised son. Oh, don't forget about Noah. - You would bring that up. Hey, um, I think I'm gonna head to bed. I'm tired. - Well, honey, we just sat down. - Yeah, I know, but I have to be up really really early. - Okay. - Sorry. Good night. - Good night, squirt. - Love you. - Love you. - You have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy, but I say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. If you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Lord, I just want to pray for Aleah. She really needs you in her life, lord. Forgive her for what she did today. Help me not to hold it against her. Just patch me up, lord. Help me do my best tomorrow. - Hey, let's head out. - Where is Riley? - Is she late again? Lily, honey, will you call her. - Probably chickened out. - Huh? - Hey, are you almost here? Everyone's loading up right now. - What? - I think lexis is getting a little testy. - P.M.? Are you kidding me? - Riley, you better get here quick. Good luck Riley. - Riley, where are you? - Lexis, I'm an idiot. I set my alarm for P.M. what do I do? - Lily, get my clipboard please. - Are we going? - They've given me nothing to go on. I have no way of knowing when you're gonna dance. Just meet us there. But get moving. - Okay. Thanks lexis. I'm really sorry. - What are you doing? - I was just gonna remind Riley to bring a picture of her boyfriend. - Here goes nothing. - Riley, good luck today. Dance for god's glory and give him your very best. I'll be praying for you. Remember, whatever you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of god. 1 Corinthians 10:31. Love you, squirt. Dad. - Riley! - Uh... excuse me? - Michael, take over for Lily. - What? I can't do make up. - Lexis, I am so sorry. - Save it. Put your stuff over there and start warming up. - How's the schedule? - They're already running late and they haven't told us a thing. Just be ready. - I'm so glad you made it. - Yeah. Me too. - I thought for sure you'd chicken out. - Hey Lily, can you help me with my necklace. - Show me a picture of Brandon, then we'll talk jewelry. - Can I have everyone's attention please. This is Ron Attwood, one of Mr. Stone's people. - As you may be aware, Mr. stone's flight is delayed. However, I just spoke with him and he will be arriving momentarily. - We expect to be starting in just a few minutes. - Who's the boss lady? - Melinda Baldwin. Event coordinator. You don't want to get on her bad side. - Lucky for you, he was late. - She's gonna need all the luck she can get today. - That girl needs a serious attitude adjustment. - Mr. Stone, such a privilege to - Ms. Baldwin, I am delighted. So sorry about the delay, but the bloody airlines. - I completely understand. - Don't worry, dear, we'll keep things moving right along. Oh, shall we? - Of course. Right this way. - That's Dimitri stone? He could be my dad. - I think he's kind of hot. - We'll be starting in about 10 minutes with group hip hop. - What does that mean? - That was very nice. You may exit to the right. - Can he do that? - Stay calm. Shh. - Lexis? - Did you see that team from Muncie? - I know. He cut their music before they even finished. - Maybe it was because they stunk. - All right, they're running behind schedule so they want to ramp it up. Senior solo division is next. Riley, release. Just do what you were born to do. Aleah, focus on performance. Make him want to see you dance. This is your day, girls. It's an audience of one. - All dancers in the senior solo division follow me. - That's fine, miss Hamilton. You may leave the stage. Exit to the right, please. Riley Adams. You may proceed. - Thank you, miss Adams. You may leave the stage. - What just happened? - Not sure. - Kelly Owen. - What happened? - Honey, I don't know. - I was going fine. - That makes no sense. - Shhh... - Quiet down. Exit the stage area. - Come on, honey. Let's go. Step out a minute. - Tough break. - You still have to get through your dance, Aleah. - I just don't get it. - I don't know, Riley. He must have seen something we couldn't see. Riley, I want to ask you something. Did you dance for an audience of one? - Yeah, I did just what you said! - I don't mean Dimitri stone. Everything happens for a reason. We'll figure this out later. But right now, we need to rise above this and do the right thing. Aleah wants this just as much as you do. So we need to go support her. Whether she deserves it or not. - Aleah Adams. You may proceed. - That was fine, miss Adams. You may exit the stage. - Great job, Aleah. - If you could wait in the staging area, we'll call you back with the results. - Aleah, you looked great. - Yeah... I know. - I've got a feeling that attitude adjustment is coming really soon. - Not soon enough for me. - Good job! - Sweet! - Looks like it's just not your day, Riley. Good thing daddy wasn't here to see it. - What? - Woe, Riley. Honey. - No, lexis, she is really good and I just got scratched. Why does she have to act this way? - Riley. - What? - There's more to this than dancing. Aleah doesn't have what you have ...in here. - Participants in the senior solo division please return to the auditorium at this time. - Would all competitors in the senior solo division please find your places on the stage. We will be announcing our top three finishers. The top two will compete in our national championship in Orlando, Florida in eight weeks. Third place will serve as an alternate in the event that any of the top two cannot compete. Mr. Stone? - Thank you, Mr. Attwood. As you all know, merely standing here places you among the nations elite dancers. You've all represented your teams and your schools splendidly. I salute you all. - Hey, good luck. - In third place with a score of 92.6 and invited to serve as alternate in the national finals, Aleah Adams. - Aleah. - Excellent job, Aleah. In second place with an even 94 points, Brooke Hamilton. Now then, I'd like to make a brief apology if I may. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we had to cut a few corners, haven't we? That said, I know a superlative performance when I see one. I'd like to direct this apology to our first place winner, who I can assure you all will certainly have the opportunity to perform her routine without interruption at our national finals in Orlando. With an outstanding 98.7 points, our first place winner, Riley Adams. - I won? - I can't believe it. Talk about ups and downs, it was sick. Oh, hang on a second. Hey, my dad is calling me, can I call you back? Okay, bye. - Well, Riley, you've had quite a month, haven't you? I think we're ready to send you home. - That's great. - When can I start dancing? - Look, Riley, I now how bad you want to start dancing again. - Nationals are only a few weeks away. I need to get started training. - Riley, maybe we should hear what doc has to say. - Your dad's right. I want you to listen to me very carefully. You suffered from severe brain contusions. For a few days, you were in a medically induced coma. Your motor skills are coming back, but this could take a while. - Honey, what doc is saying is that we're going to have to be realistic. - I don't care about what's realistic. I care about what's possible. - Okay, I agree. I think when you're feeling up to it, you should dance again, but you need to understand, Riley, there's no shortcut. It's going to be like starting all over again. - I can do it. - I know you can do it. You've been bull headed since you were in diapers. I wonder, though. - What? Spit it out, doc. - I was just thinking about something that's been effective for patients with cerebral palsy, you know, permanent brain injuries, not like Riley. Just hear me out, okay? You want to get the fastest results you can, right? Okay. If you just work on dancing, you will get frustrated. You see, you have the type of brain injury that wants to just heal at its own pace. But if we help her develop new skills, it might just help move it along. Does that make any sense? - What are we talking about? - Equine therapy. - What are we horses? - It will help develop her coordination and strength, get her out in the fresh air. - I'll try anything. - If it's okay with your dad. - Well, she is an adult. Whatever you think's best. - Well, I'll go ahead and make a call, and I'll get back to you later today. - No turning back now. - You're sure you're ready for this? - I'm ready. - Can I help you? - I'm Michael Adams. This is Riley, she's here for her therapy. - Name's gauff. I take care of most of the horses. Well, come on, we got some rules to go over. - If it ain't yours, don't touch it. Upstairs, off limits. If you ain't got proper shoes, stay out of the barn. We'll let it go this time. Don't let me catch you in the tack room. The tack room's off limits unless you got your own equipment. And you ain't got your own equipment. And never, and I mean never, go into a stall or heaven forbid get on a horse without proper supervision. We clear? - We're clear. Mr. Gauff. - Yeah, all right, then. I guess we understand each other. You can be back and pick her up at 4 o'clock sharp. - Yes, Mr. Gauff. - Just gauff. - Oh, gauff. Um, could I have a word with Riley alone? - Suit yourself but make it quick. Ain't got all day. - Are you sure you're up to this? I mean, we can go to a different stable. We must have - no, dad, I can do this. I've got to m-m-make nationals. - But honey, it's just that he's such a tool. - No, I can handle it. Pinkie promise. I've got to do this. - Well, all right. Listen, I gotta work late. Got some catching up to do. I told Marge to pick you up here at 4. - Okay, all right. - Love you, sweetie. - Love you, too. Bye, dad. - Bye bye. - Riley Adams? - Yeah,. - Hi, I'm Casey. Gauff told me you were here. - Riley Adams. - Yeah, I know. I just said that. - Right, sorry. - I'm going to be working with you. - Oh. Gauff I thought yeah. N-N-Never mind. - Yeah, he's a ray of sunshine isn't he? - Yeah. - Well, you'll get used to him. He's a good guy, but he's a little rough. Hey, Benjie, come here. I want you to meet somebody. This is Benjie, he helps me out around here. - Hi, Benjie, it's n-n-nice to meet you. - Why do you talk like that? - Hey, that's not polite. - Oh, it's okay. I got a little kn-kn-knock on the head. - Well, I've had a few of those before. - Hey, Benjie, why don't you start watering down at that end over there? Can you sweep the aisle, too. Thanks, buddy. - He's a little cutie. - Yeah, he's a good kid. - Uh, so are you a horse trainer? - No, no, not really. Gauff is the horse trainer. I'm trained as a physical therapist. Been around horses all my life, and equine therapy kind of is a natural fit. I sometimes volunteer with kids through my church, too. - So that's where Benjie from? - Yeah, yeah, exactly. He's had kind of a tough home life, so. - So is this the-the-horse? - Grace? No, she's my cousin's horse. I think she's a little too much for a beginner, but I don't know, you never know. If you ride as well as you can dance, anything's possible. - She's beautiful. - Yeah, she's quite a horse. She had an injury a while back, so she's been on stall rest for a while. Now she just needs miles. - Miles? - Exercise on the long line. Help build her strength back up. Gauff says she's born to compete. - Guess we've got something in c-c-common. - That's what I hear. Yeah, she is beautiful. So we should probably get to it, huh? - Yeah. - Hey, Benjie, can you get the door, buddy? - All right, now, I'm going to grab your left leg, and we're going to push you up and you're going to take your right and push it on the other side, okay? - All right. - All right, here we go. Ready, one, two, three. Now swing it over, nice. Let's check here. Put your foot in there. - These boots feel funky. - Well, that's all we got. Now I know you've had some trouble with speech and sequencing, and that's totally normal for an injury like yours. We'll keep it simple. All right, now, if you want to go, all you have to do is give a little squeeze with your legs okay? To stop, close your hands and relax. To go right, turn your body right. And to go left do the same. For now, that's all you need to know. What I want you to do is to walk, stop, walk again and turn left. Use your body, go to the left, and he'll go. That's it. And again, if you want to go, just squeeze those legs, stop. Just close your hand and relax, okay? Whoa. Excellent job. Really, really good. I can't believe this is your first time. You did really well on him today. - You call that good? - All right, well, maybe it wasn't a star performance, but getting a little tongue tied does not change your passion and drive, and that is what's going to take you places. - Is this grace? - Yeah, here. You can pet her. - Really? - Yeah. You really like her, huh? - Yeah, she's like a dancer. Powerful, yet graceful. - I'll tell you what. Maybe I can pull some strings and we can work with her next lesson. - Really? - No promises, but I'll see what I can do. You know what? It's 4 o'clock, your ride's probably here. Come on, grace. - Bye. - So next Wednesday? - Right. - All right, we'll go this way. - You better just keep your mind on your work. - Riley? Is that you, squirt? - Hey, I thought you had to work late. - I felt guilty. Decided to call it a day and make you a nice dinner. - Oh, that's nice. - So, how was the therapy session? - It was fun. - That gauff guy didn't seem too fun. - My therapist said I did really well. - Well, he must have lightened up then. - Hey, do you need help? - Uh, sure, yeah. You can make the salad. We are having szechwan stir fry. This recipe goes back to the Ming dynasty. The secret is in the peppercorns. You grind them just so. It's also about the scallions. Most people don't realize that if you blow the peppercorns you can actually salvage the recipe if you can work magic with the scallions, which is amazing because you wouldn't think the scallions would be such a big deal. - I don't know what to do. - What? - I-I-I don't remember how to do it. - What's the big deal, honey? It's just a salad. Here, look. You just take this. - No, no! I don't want help. - It's no big deal. - No, dad! I-I-I can do it. I feel like a freak. - Riley? - Riley? Honey, can we talk? Okay. If you change your mind, I'll be downstairs burning the stir fry. - Hey, dad? - Yeah? - Why did god w-w-want this to happen to me? - Um... Riley, I don't know. I asked myself that same question a thousand times. Now this life, it's pretty over rated. It's over in a flash, even if you live to be 90. But you're here, and I just have a feeling that he's doing a lot more than we could ever guess. All good. Besides, you gotta look at the bright side. You needed a break from Aleah. - He's got her on grace? - Riley, you are a woman on a mission. - Well, I gotta be if I’m gonna be ready to make nationals. - Hey, you will be ready. I know you will. Come on, let's get her a drink. - What's up with the Grinch? - Gauff? He doesn't cope with change too well. - What do you mean? - Well, I think he's a little annoyed that we have you on grace and not dusty. Who knows? I mean, you never know what he's thinking. - Well, she sure is a s-s-sweetie. - You guys seem like you're made for each other. Well, I think she's done drinking, let's go. Come on, come on, grace. Doing okay? - Yeah. - So who's her owner? - My uncle. He owns grace, dusty and a dozen other horses here. It's too much for my uncle bill to deal with. That's why he hired gauff as a full-time caretaker. - Weird, I'd be here all the t-t-time if I had a place like this. - Well, they got into horses for their daughter, my cousin, and it kind of spun out of control. She rides, but she's really not that into it. Actually, she's more of a dancer. - Really? Well, what's her name. Maybe I know her. - Here's another funny one for you. She has the same last name as you. - Aleah? - Riley? - Aleah. - Casey, what how? - Wait you guys know each other? - This is beyond ironic. - Hey, you know what? You should hang around. You should watch her, she's doing great. - That's okay. I actually have to be somewhere. - Always an attitude. - I'm familiar with that. - Well, hey, if you want to get to the top, you better get to work. - All right. - Come on. - Two, three. All right, both feet in the stirrups? - Yep. - Let's go. Come on a little closer. A little bit closer, yeah, perfect. - Hey, dad, you're here early. - Doc asked about your progress, so I thought I’d stop by and see for myself. - Oh, um, dad this is c-c-Casey. He's my therapist. - Casey? - Mr. Adams, nice to meet you. Hey, you now what? It's almost 4, so we can wrap for the day. - What? - That's your therapist? That's not a therapist, honey. That's a that's a guy. - You're the one who s-s-said that god's doing a lot more than we could ever guess. - Yeah, but I didn't mean... That's not a therapist. - You will never guess who showed up at the barn today. - Casey, I think it's great that we can use the horses to expand your professional opportunities. I'm just a little concerned, that's all. - Uncle bill, I thought we went over this. What did Aleah say? - Aleah had nothing to do with this, Casey. - I just don't think you should of that girl on grace, that's all. - Uncle bill, she's a natural, okay? And you know I would never do anything to put Riley in danger. - It ain't the danger, it's a liability. Something goes wrong, Mr. Adams here gets sued. And I'm out of a job. - Gauff, look, I value your opinion, but Casey here has been on my horses since he's been in diapers. - But the girl hasn't. - If he says that grace is the right horse to use, well that's good enough for me. Casey, you just make sure she follows all the rules, all right? - I'm there, uncle bill. - But, sir, I'm just not sure this is such a good - gauff I've heard enough. Now you two boys work this thing out. In the meantime, I'll have my attorney check into my exposure. I don't think it's a big deal. Now, gentlemen, my tee time awaits. - I swear, if she breaks just one rule, that's it. I'll shut her down. - Gauff, you don't have to worry. I'll take care of it, all right? - I'll bet you will. - Well, I can definitely see improvement, but I want to keep you on the equine therapy for a few more weeks. - Well, what with dancing? Can I s-s-start training with the team again? - Well, that's really up to your coach, not me. But you know what? I don't see why not. Riley, why don't you wait outside? I want to go over a few things with your dad. - What aren't you telling us? - Mike, the lord has an amazing plan for her life. - I know. - But... Not as a dancer. - But she will make a full recovery, right? - It's going to be a long road. - What am I supposed to tell her? - My advice? I think she'll figure it out soon enough. Just keep her busy with the horses. She needs to develop new interests. I'm praying for you, Mike. - Casey, guess what Hey, girl. How are you? Hi, hi. Hey. You want a snack? I bet you're hungry, huh? What are you doing? I'll get you something. Be right back. - What do you think you're doing? - I was just going to tack up grace. - No, you're not! What did I tell you the first day? You do not go into a stall without supervision! - I forgot. I'm sorry. - I told him this would be trouble. - Well, that was short lived. What are you doing? Hey, Benjie. - You are so in trouble. - You heard what I said. - Oh, boy. - Riley, gauff just told me what happened. - I know, I'm sorry. I just f-f-forgot. - You could have gotten hurt. - I know, it won't again. Pinkie promise. - All right, just be careful next time, please. Gauff's got to run a tight ship here. - Oh, I have good news. - Yeah, what's that? - Doc says I get to start dancing again. So you know what that means? - Nationals. - Nationals, can you believe it? - Congratulations. And Aleah both, that's incredible. - Wait, Aleah? - Yeah, it's like the big family news. What, what's wrong? - Casey, don't you r-r-realize what that means? - It means she's not going, Casey. Didn't lexis tell you? - No, she wouldn't do that. - Oh, please, Riley. You know how this works. I placed third which makes me runner up. Besides, we all know you're not going to be up for it. - Yeah, yeah, everyone but m-m-me. - Riley? Aleah, do you ever think about anybody other than yourself? - What is that supposed to mean? - Do you know how hard it is for her? To work so hard and get one setback after another? - Yeah, Casey, as a matter of fact I do. I've been coming in second to her since I was 8 years old. - That's not her fault. - And it's not my fault she got hurt. - I never said that it was. - You want know feel guilty? Fine, I feel guilty, all right? She had to find out sometime. - Dad, I need you to take me to dance. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. I'll just meet you in the car. - What's she doing here? - Why are you doing this? - Need a hug? Where are you going? - I don't know. Home I guess. - On foot? - What? - I can't take her. I haven't passed my driving test yet. - Come on. - Riley? How did you get home? I thought I was picking you up in an hour. - Father, you know what Riley is going through right now. ♪ Hey, where are you now ... ♪ Want to climb again but you just don't know how ... ♪ Here, deep inside ... ♪ No way out, running against the tide ... ♪ Can't turn back the hands of time no more ... ♪ You gotta let go ... ♪ You gotta let go ... ♪ Hey, where are you now ... ♪ Every time you stand you get knocked down ... ♪ Here deep inside ... ♪ Feel betrayed by all your foolish pride ... ♪ You're weary and you don't wanna fight no more ... ♪ You've gotta let go ... ♪ You've gotta let go ... ♪ You've gotta let go ... ♪ You've gotta let go ... ♪ Girl, you've gotta let go... - Pop, pop, pop, pop, snap. Pull back, all the way back and hit it hard. Keep it rolling, guys. Back in a minute. Hi, Riley. It's so good to see you. How are you, honey? - I've been better. - Riley, I'm so sorry. I know how hard you've been working to get back. But girl, you have to move forward. - Yeah, I know. I just, I wish I could have heard it from you. - I guess I really blew it, didn't I? - You could say that god is teaching me some hard lessons right now. - I know he has. I know he has. - I guess I just, I came to tell you that I understand and I'm glad you're doing what's best for the team, you know. - Hang on a second. I know you're going to be back. - I'm not so sure, Lex. - Well, I am. You listen, here's my cell. If you need to talk, get a latte, whatever, you give me a call. - You never give your cell to anyone. - Well, you're not just anyone. You're Riley Adams, and around here that means something. - Thank you. - Gotta get back in there. Time to kick some Booty. You want to come in and say hey? - No, it's okay. Can I actually talk to Aleah for a minute? - Sure. - Yeah. - Yeah, Riley? - Kick butt at nationals, okay? I know you can do it. Do it for me, okay? Letting go of my dream to dance was hard but I felt sure that I had done the right thing and I had a feeling something good was around the corner. - Okay. Riley, if we can get you doing a solid walk, trot, and canter by October and get you in at least 2 shows. Are you up for it? - Yeah, I'm up for it! - Riley, you have talent and drive and a great attitude. I think you and grace are going to be a great team. - I need to speak with you in the tack room. You heard what your uncle said. - She slipped up once, gauff. It happens. Come on. - She broke the rules. - She went into a stall to pet a horse. - Grace ain't just a horse. - I know. She's the horse. She's the horse who needs a lot of miles, right, with a student who is not going to push and pull and do all that stuff that you hate. You should be out there instructing her. - I ain't got time to train no cripple. - You've got to be kidding. Her challenges are temporary. - Hey, Benji. - Hey. Just say busy. - What? - That's what I do when my parents fight. Just stay busy so you don't think about it. - And you're still just hung up on her going to a stall to pet a horse. People do that all the time. - When I was 26 I had a student. Went into a stall just like her, going to pet a horse. Well, the horse spooked. I had to Bury the kid. - I'm sorry, gauff. I didn't know that happened. - Yeah. It's because it didn't. I had to say something to shut you up. - Gauff, okay. Does this mean you're going to help me or what? - Go call your girl. Tell her to get out to the area, you twerp. And tack up grace. The indoor arena. If we're going to do this thing, let's make it safe. - Do I really have to wear these? - You better get used to them. ♪ Breathe deep and let it out... ♪ Your time has finally come... ♪ Sometimes you gotta turn around ... ♪ Recall how you begun ... - Head, shoulder, elbow, hip, heel.

Tell him, ed. - Like bill said, you're in a very precarious position in the event in any kind of an accident. - If that girl gets hurt, we could wind up in a world of hurt. You could even be named in a lawsuit. - Bill's family is completely liable for anything that happens with those horses. - Bill, we had her sign a waiver. - With all due respect, Mr. gauff - just gauff. - With all due respect, gauff, your waiver offers no legal protection at all. - Courts will chew up a waiver like that and spit it back out. - Isn't that what the horse barn liability barn is for? It's clearly posted. - But that pertains to an individual using their own animal on the farm property. - Meaning if it's on our horses, that posting don't mean a thing. What is it, honey? We're in a meeting here. - I put dusty out so I'm going to take off. - All right. - Riley and grace, they're a team. - Well, if you've got a problem then. If she's on my horse, then I’m on the hook. Listen, I don't know this gal's daddy and a lawsuit is one more headache that I do not have time for. I can not take unnecessary chances. At the very least that girl's got to get a horse of her own. And until that time I’m shutting it down. - I'll let Casey know. - Hello? - Hey, Riley. - Hey, Casey. - Listen, are you free tonight by any chance? - Sure. Why? What's up? - Well, there were a couple of things that I wanted to talk to you about. About us. - Oh. Okay. What time? - Um, let's say about 7. I'll pick you up. - Sure. 7 is good. I'll see you then. - Okay. See you then. - Riley? Is everything all right? - Dad, you can't freak out. - I'm pretty sure you're freaked out enough for both of us. - I'm going on a date. - Good. - Lexis, you've got to come help me. - What's that stuff? - Tg cat walk.

Dad, he's here. - Casey. - Hey, Mr. Adams. I'm here to pick up Riley. Wow, you look great. - I'm like way over dressed. - No, you look great. - I'll be right back. - Hmmm. Good pizza. - Yeah. It's really good. - So you said you wanted to talk about us. - Oh, yeah. That. It's about grace. - Um, what about her? - Well, there are some liability issues. - What's that mean? - If you were to get hurt - just say it. - You're not going to be able to ride grace anymore. - What? What did I do? - No, you didn't do anything. It's my uncle bill. If you were to get hurt, he would be in a tight position. You guys were making so much progress. - Do you remember when you said that my drive would take me somewhere? Well, lately it just seems like no matter how driven I am I find out how little difference it makes. - Riley, sometimes our ideas aren't god's ideas. I'm in the same boat as you. - What do you mean? - Career choices, you know. I'm getting hammered by med solutions. - What's med solutions? - Med solutions. It's a physical therapy company. They offered me this great job and it's in Phoenix. I haven't committed to it yet but it's a pretty tempting offer if the whole equine therapy doesn't work out, you know. - Doesn't work out? - No, I didn't mean that how it sounded. - Is that what I am to you? Just a stepping stone in your career path? - No. Riley, no.

Is Riley home? I need to talk to her. - Riley doesn't really want to talk to you right now. - Please, Mr. Adams. - Casey? - Riley. We need to talk. - Casey - just hear me out, Riley. - What is there to hear? - Just listen. - You brought her with you? - Just listen, Riley. - You know what, Riley. You need to stop assuming you know everything that's going on and listen. - Aleah, wait a second. - No. I've got something to say. And when I'm done, I will gladly leave. Ever since I've known you you've been this Christian girl who never does anything wrong. God gave you more talent in your pinky than I could ever hope to have. And the worst thing is you're so nice. It's disgusting. I can't find one stupid thing to criticize. And trust me it's not for lack of trying. But you know what, Riley Adams? You don't have a clue about what's really going on. - At the very least that girl has to get a horse of her own, and until that time I’m shutting it down. - I'll let Casey know. - Dad? - What is it, honey? - Can I talk to you about something? - It's fine. I've got a call I need to make. - Thanks, ed. What is it, honey? I'm in a bit of a time crunch here. - You said if gauff or Casey trained Riley on our horse, we're liable in the event of an accident? - Yes. That's right. We're liable if anyone uses our horses. - So if grace wasn't our horse, we're not liable? - Well, yes. That stands to reason, honey. What's your point? - Sign grace over to Riley. Problem solved. - She does have a point. - Are you sure about this, honey? - She needs a break, okay. I vouched for you, Riley. And you know why? Because you deserve it. That's why. People are watching. Grace is yours, Riley. Now do something with her. - Are you okay? - I think I'm gonna puke. ♪ Close enough ... ♪ I just might doubt myself... ♪ And what it was turned into something else ... ♪ I can't resist the way you see all I've been ... ♪ I built a sturdy wall... ♪ You chip away without even trying ... ♪ And I'm about to fall ... ♪ That's close enough ... ♪ Tell me if it's now or never... ♪ Because everything is turning around ... ♪ And when you lean in closer, my heart beats harder ... ♪ A million times ... ♪ Your pale blue eyes sink into me underneath the Willow tree ♪ close enough to see what you're doing to me ... ♪ Hey, what you're doing to me... - It's beautiful out.

You mean a lot to him. He's put a lot of heart into you, too. - So what are you getting at? - I want to ask him to coach you at the show. - You'll still be there, right? - Yeah, but I'm going to lay back.

I had experienced a healing I didn't even know I needed and my life was changed by the people I least expected. Gauff. Casey. Even Aleah. And a beautiful fresian mare named grace.

Aleah, you don't have to do that. - Do what? - I thought you were going to try to give me the - yeah. I like you Riley, but not that much. - Now, that's the Aleah I know. Oh, and one other thing I should probably mention. Okay. Now, if you guys want to feed a treat to a horse, you want to hold your land like this. Like that. Can you remember that? - You know what? We're out of time. Hey, who is going to come back tomorrow and help us feed the horses? - Me! - Yep, Casey and I got married. And soon we were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. - Okay, everyone. Time to line up at the gate. - Sometimes god's plans are different. - Bye, you guys. Oh, speaking of feeding - oh. Actually can you hang on one second? - Sure. - But the lord's plan is so much better.
