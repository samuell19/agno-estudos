'Smoking and alcohol consumption are injurious to health.' "Why are these nights becoming erratic?" "Why are these nights becoming erratic?" "Why are these nights becoming erratic?" "Why are these nights becoming erratic?" "Oh, baby.. You're driving me crazy." "Come a little closer to me." "Oh, baby.. You're driving me crazy." "Come a little closer to me." "These nights.." "I search for you in everything." "I want to be with you." "I am losing myself in you..' 'Hey, guys! Welcome back to the show.' 'I'm playing a different kind of music' 'as it's Valentine's Day.' 'And the music that I played now is called Jazz music, guys.' 'By the way, our caller, Suraj is on the line.' 'Didn't you hear his story?' 'Apparently, he hasn't quarrelled' 'in the three years that he has been in love.' 'You might find it difficult to believe. Even I feel the same way.' 'Let it be. Suraj, tell us..' 'Where did you see your girlfriend for the first time?' 'When did you see her?' 'Tell us about that unforgettable day.' 'It happened on a Friday.' 'It was the Black Friday of my life.' We just landed. We'll be there in five minutes. Hey! She's talking to an airport officer. She'll come.. Okay.. She's here. Is it Swathi? - Yes. - Give it to me. What has happened to this place? See.. - Have you taken everything? - I'm telling you. Kerala is no more God's own country. 'Shoba, you are here to attend my wedding, right?' 'My cousin is waiting for you outside.' 'You'll recognise him when you see him.' - Shoba? 'He looks like a tramp.' Tramp? - 'Did you see him?' Yes.. I think I found him. Please.. Even I used to live in Chennai. - Oh! Where in Chennai? Someplace in Chennai.. By the way, how is Swathi related to you? I'm Sagar, son of Swathi's uncle's elder brother. How is Dinesh related to you? Do you know Dinesh? - Yes. Swathi told me everything. Is that so? What can I say, buddy? There's a good-for-nothing like him in every family. He drinks and picks fights. He has become a public nuisance. The only fault that he has is that he is my cousin. That's not how it is. You know? By the way, I'm also a doctor. Oh, wow! Are you a doctor? - Yes. Where are you practising? - I just go to nearby hospitals and operate on patients. So, how do you know Swathi? All of us studied together in Chennai. - Is that so? Shoba, I.. - Hey, Venkat! Either speak in Tamil or Malayalam. Or just keep quiet for some time. Tell me more.. "Oh, beloved.." Isn't it perfect now? Look at this. Hi, Swathi! - Hi. "Oh, beloved.." "Oh, beloved.." Shoba.. By the way, while you were in college you never used to wear earrings bangles and necklaces. You also said that you wanted your wedding to be simple. Is this the simple wedding that you were talking about? When I thought about it later I realised that weddings are occasions that happen once in a lifetime. That's why I would like to do it in a grand manner. Who said so? You can get married any number of times. You, instigator.. Do you have a plan to get married again? Where's Anand? Anand and his family will arrive at night. Oh! Look at the way she's blushing. Where are your parents? My parents are practising dance. Dance practice? "Oh, beloved! You are wonderful! What you do is great too." What's he doing? Stand up! Move aside.. - "Oh, beloved.." Step aside.. Help me stand up. "With your touch.." - Oh, God. Stop the music.. Let's try again. Come on. "The canopy is ready.. - "The wedding canopy is ready.." "Oh, bride! Adorn yourself as you are getting married today!" "Oh, dear! You are getting married today." - Come. All of you have come! - How are you, sir? Tamil? Did you forget Malayalam, Shoba? You should come to your hometown once in a while. That's not the case, sir. I don't get time as I'm busy in Chennai. You have to find time. Where else can you find the beauty of our lush, green hometown? There are dance and other events at night. I expect involvement from all of you. Oh, no! Do we have to dance, sir? Yes. That's required.. There's no event other than dance. Am I not right? - Yes. Wasn't there another person with you? Kala's husband.. Who is she to ask me to keep quiet, buddy? Who does she think she is? Who are you talking about, buddy? - Shoba.. She's the girl who asked me to keep quiet in the car. She's our gang leader, buddy. She's a feminist. Poor girl.. She doesn't look like one. She's my wife's best friend. My wife never listens to me. She does everything after consulting Shoba. She has no respect for me, buddy. Sad, buddy. Who's your wife? She was sleeping in the back seat. Kala.. She's my wife. Is she your wife? You don't believe me, right? - No. Show it. I may be dark-complexioned but I'm good-hearted. That's why I made her fall for me easily. Buddy, who was the girl sitting next to Shoba? The one who looked cute.. Cute? That's Priya. She's a good girl. She has a nice character, buddy. Anyway, thanks. I'll see you later. Buddy, what about the bill? - Let's pay the bill later. Just come. Buddy.. Why don't we have another drink? Let's not have it now. Let's have one during lunch and one in the night. We can have it all the time. We have to do it to be energetic, right? Okay. I'll wait in the room in that case. Okay. Who was that? Someone.. You don't even know his name, right? Why do you need to know his name and details for drinking together, right? - Yes. No, Aunt. By the way, where's Dinesh? Isn't he home? That means even you don't know where he is. He took his bag and left home last night. He said that he'd not let this happen as long as he is alive! He said that the wedding would take place only if he's dead. He said many things like that before leaving. If he dies? He mentioned that his dead body would surface in the river on the day of the wedding. How is that possible? The dead body surfaces after three days, right? If he had left the day before yesterday his dead body would've surfaced tomorrow. Didn't he leave yesterday? Didn't you ask him which river he was going to drown himself in? I asked him. When I did, he looked at me and asked me what kind of a mother I am. - He's right about that. When he said that, I told him to go and kill himself. Are you his mom or what! - Go and find out where he went. Isn't he your friend? If you find him, just ask him to come home at night. Otherwise, I'll teach him a lesson. Did you understand? - Okay, Aunt. Where will I look for him? What kind of a mom is she? He's here. - Did you like it? Hi. Where were you? You're late. - It looked beautiful. I just went to see it. Where? - I.. Hello? - I referred to the view. Yes, Dad. We just arrived. - The river is beautiful. Everything is all right, Dad. Yes, Dad. What happened? Why is she crying? - I'm sorry. Dad, can I call you after some time? Okay. She was fine, right? What happened all of a sudden? - What are you all discussing? Priya, it's her wedding tomorrow. - No. I asked her about Ravi. Did you have to bring that up when we have a lot of other topics to discuss? Okay. Forget that.. Hey! Weren't you guys talking about her cousin in the car? What's his name? Dinesh? Even he doesn't know where he's going or what he's doing. He's a different kind of retarded psycho. Apparently, cousins aren't supposed to get married. I would've transfused my blood for her, Dad. Mr. Dinesh. If you drink so much.. - Hey.. You are just the driver and you needn't have the concern that my family doesn't have for me. - That's not the reason. You'll finish it soon if you drink so much. There's no bar nearby. Dad, you left me alone. Hello? - 'Is he in a bad mood?' No. He's looking at the sky and talking to his father. 'Great..' - He forces me to drink alcohol and brags about it later. Shameless guy. - How can I bear it! - 'Hey! That's enough.' Dad.. - Sagar, I'm fed up with him. 'Even I'm fed up with him.' I'll give the phone to him. - 'Give it.' - How could she.. Mr. Dinesh.. It's Mr. Sagar. Won't you let me die peacefully? 'Dinesh, she must've said something when she was young.' 'She changed her decision after she grew up, right?' - Oh. That means you're on her side, right? 'I'm always on your side, idiot!' 'Both of them are celebrating here.' 'You can kill yourself tomorrow if you want. But today..' 'Shouldn't we teach her a small lesson, Dinesh?' Not a small one.. Let it be a big one. - 'That's the spirit.' Start the vehicle.. 'Wear seatbelts while driving cars.' You reek of alcohol. You look awful, Dinesh. A wedding will be conducted here. Wedding.. Oh.. You're dressed up for it, right? How is it? Doesn't it look good? - Shut up! Tell me about the plan! Get out first. I'll kill him today! Hey, pal. "You're the one" "who was in my heart" "since childhood." "You were the one in my heart." "You're the one" "who was in my heart.." - My career and my ambitions are important to me. I don't have time to waste by having a relationship. "You were the one in my heart." "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "Just leave if you can't do it." Dinesh, when I googled, I found out that children born to blood relatives will have disabilities. Let's not continue our relationship, Dinesh. I'm sorry. "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "Just leave if you can't do it." "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "Just leave if you can't do it." "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "Just leave if you can't do it." Isn't it entertaining? Just forget her if she doesn't love you. Both of you aren't a good match anyway, right? - Yes. Dinesh. There are many girls in this world. If you don't explore all that you're wasting your time, dear. - Isn't that a movie dialogue? Don't you have anything else to tell me? I have something to tell you. The event after this program is my dance. - Are you serious? You have to watch it and have food before leaving. "Don't laugh at me" "when I put myself in trouble, pal." "Don't laugh at me, pal." "You're the one in my heart.." That guy is Dinesh. - What? The guy who's standing there is Dinesh. "You were the one in my heart." "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "Just leave if you can't do it." - Brijesh! "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." - B for Brijesh.. Do you recognise me? Let's get him. Let go of me.. - You were clapping your hands for a long time. Let go.. I was just asking you if you recognised me. - What? Don't you recognise me? I'm DJ Brijesh. I was your junior in school. DJB. Don't you remember me? I don't. - Oh. Okay, fine. - Briju.. Don't you have a sister named Rachitha? Where is she now? So, you remember my sister. But you don't remember me. Okay. Just leave. Hey.. Let him go. Tell me about our plan. - What plan? Didn't you ask me to come so that we could teach her a lesson? About that.. I've arranged some itching powder. I've also found out his room number. Let's scatter it all over his room, Dinesh. Didn't I tell you that it has to be something big? What do we do then? We can't kill him, right? We should kill him. - Kill him? Get lost.. Go and kill yourself if you want. I'm going. Hey! What was the groom's room number? 312. 3, 2, 1.. Come on. Go there by yourself. What's there? Wow! Well.. - What do you want? I'm wondering how I can kill him. The program will be over soon and they're going to come there. Just do something and come down. I have an idea! They're coming. Come fast.. - I didn't do anything. Come.. Run.. - Run.. This way.. - Yes. What did you do? He shouldn't have messed with me. Did you slit his throat? Shut up! I walked like a cat across that corridor filled with darkness. I opened the door slowly. Pogo.. Bangles? Drat! I have an idea! This is for you! Dinesh. - What? Things have gone out of control, Dinesh. They're saying that her condition is very serious. Anyway, your idea has misfired completely. Girl? What's her name? Shoba. - Shoba. What was Shoba doing in the groom's room at night? That's right. Nobody wants to know that. That guy and she are cheating Swathi. Why don't we ruin this wedding by saying that? Dinesh, let that girl marry someone and do whatever she wants. Isn't that better? Isn't that what you want? - Yes. But still.. What? I feel something.. - Fishy.. Fishy. - Fishy? Fishy. Is she okay? - She's okay. Nothing to worry. But the doctor has asked her to take rest here tonight. One small thing. If someone stays here with me it'll be very helpful. Not one, I'll give you two people. Thank you. - Satheesh, call them. Shall I call Dinesh? - Call both of them. Hey, Dinesh! Your uncle is calling both of you. Why? Ask him to come here if he wants. - Dinesh, don't make me angry. Why did you go to that toilet when you should have slept? Wouldn't she slip if you spill hair oil on the floor? Do you know for how long I've been waiting here? - Oh, no. Just come! - Kala, just go to the hotel along with Venkat. Don't worry. I'll give you a tight slap! Dinesh.. You have to stay here tonight. I can't do it. - Hush. You can stay here if you want. Aren't you my dear nephew? Please adjust. I gave them my word that I would make someone stay here. Please. Didn't you hear him? You have to come home tomorrow morning with her. Ask him to stay here with me in that case. It's all right. I'll stay here alone. Good. Everyone, please come. - Jeez! Drat! She looks good. Oh. That might be the case. Never forget to destroy the evidence when you do something wrong. Especially when the person at fault leaves behind his wallet.. Wallet.. - He would be a halfwit, right? - Oh, no. His room is 412. My room is 312. Oh. Idiot! I-I went to the wrong room. The bangle on your hand is mine. Oh.. I got the wrong person. Please don't tell anybody about it. I'll tell everyone. It was just an accident. Please don't defame me. That's okay. Aren't you going to kill yourself tomorrow anyway? I won't tell anybody about it. But you have to do as I say. I'll do anything. You have to attend her wedding tomorrow. That's.. - Come on. This too shall pass. There might be a girl waiting for you as well. She'll change your life. Trust me. Are you sure? - I'm sure. And don't forget to trim your beard before you come. Usually, most of the girls like my beard. Not a beard like this one.. Trim your beard, get a hair cut and take a shower before coming. Didn't I take a shower two days ago? If you do that, girls will fall for you. That's right.. Really? - Really. Okay, Dinesh. Goodnight. I'll sit here if you want. If you need tea, coffee or medicines.. - No, Dinesh. Don't you want me to sit here? - Thank you. That girl who's sitting outside is snoring a lot. Bangle. She avoided me. Forget it. And we're entering Swathi's room. - Show me your hand. All the girls are getting ready. - A bit more. Super! - She looks good, doesn't she? My wife also looks good today. What are you doing here in the girls' changing room? Go outside. - She looks amazing. Why are you roaming around here? Didn't you get ready, dear? Let me finish this, Uncle. You can doll yourself up better than this for your next wedding. Come fast. 1, 2, 3.. Where's the fourth girl who fell down, in the toilet? Where did she go? - Where's Shoba? She'll be here.. Even though she arrives late she arrives in style. Am I right? - You're right. "Oh, bride.." "Oh, bride.." "Oh, bride.." Rice.. Do you want some rice? Don't you want it? All right. Some rice. Have some rice. - Please eat. Would you like some rice? - Enough.. - Have some more. Some more. - A bit more. - Thanks. Rice. Have it if you want. - So sweet.. Sir, please have some rice. - Eat it.. Ma'am, rice? I've been noticing this ever since you came on the stage. You were smiling back at him when he smiled at you. Why do you have a soft corner for him? I was convinced after seeing his enthusiasm. No.. He's a nice guy. Very innocent. You'll find out if he's innocent after you get to know him better. You don't know him well, Shoba. Fresh buttermilk.. Buttermilk.. Shall I pour some buttermilk? - I don't want buttermilk. It was prepared just now. It's fresh. Have it. - I don't want it. Didn't you eat the banana that I gave you? Eat it. Dinesh, come here.. Just give me a second. My mom won't let me stay here. Come here. What do you want? Did you see Swathi's friend who came from Chennai? Why don't we consider her for Satish? She's a good girl. Just shut up! Otherwise, I'll stab you with this! - What is it? Sir, please give me some buttermilk. You don't need it. Tissue. Give it to me. Hi. How's everything going? - Hi. Oh, wow! - Yes. - Now, you look good. Yes. I know.. - You look better now. Nice earrings. - Thank you. Give me your number. - Oh, yes. Sure. - Yes, okay. Hey, Shoba. What are you doing here? Come.. It's already late. - Give me a second. - Everybody is waiting for you to take photos. Dad, they're all going to leave now. Aren't you supposed to stay and enjoy for a few days when you come for a wedding? Aren't you supposed to plan things accordingly? - No, sir. I have some work there. I'll be able to get it done only if I leave now. I see.. So, what can I do for you? - I see.. Shall I arrange a driver to drop you? - Yes.. Uncle, I heard that you were looking for a driver. It's for Shoba. - Is that so? I'll drop you off. - Oh. Wouldn't it be inconvenient for Dinesh? Oh.. No way! How would it be inconvenient? - Yes. The only thing that he knows is driving. Shoba, you might want to go to the room and take rest. I'll come to take your luggage. Room number 412, right? Yes. Okay. I'll come. - I booked it.. Okay.. Okay, sir. Bye.. - Bye. See you.. - Bye.. Bye. - See you. You should be happy! - Why are you so enthusiastic? Can't I show some enthusiasm? Do whatever you want! Sad. Jeez! Hey! "Oh, beautiful girl, I'll tell you something if you come with me." "My life.." "I will not leave you." "If I do so.." - "I will not sleep." I know everything that's going on. You don't need me anymore. What did Shoba tell you? She's deeply in love with me. So, I'm just doing a small favour for her. Yes.. Based on her expressions, I could make out that she isn't interested in you. - Yes.. That's possible.. Isn't she a young woman? It's quite natural. Come here. And stand here. What was his room number? - 312. What was it? - 312. 312 is her room number. His room number is 412. Was it the wrong room? - It was the wrong room. Not just the room, it was a different floor. But that's okay. This is the first time that I benefited from your carelessness. Didn't you benefit from it? Anyway, aren't you happy? Definitely. - Why don't we have a couple of shots then? Oh, no! I'm super busy, you know? I have to go to the airport and I have plans. Love, lust.. Just get lost. If you have a couple of shots, you'll be in a good mood. It'll make you energetic. After drinking, you'll be romantic. Really? - Yes. Come.. What's the time now? - 2 o'clock. In that case, we can have a couple of shots, right? Absolutely.. "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." What's the time? 2 o'clock. In that case, give me two more shots. "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." Dinesh. Hey, gorgeous. - Yes. Let's.. Just one.. Oh, no.. Shall I make another drink? Give me two more shots, buddy. Oh, no! That's enough. Enough.. - He can't hold his drink. "A cold night that smells like" "Pandanus flower.." Has it got dark? The time is 2 o'clock. But it's very dark outside, Dinesh. I think this watch isn't working. - Hey! "When I see you standing on the veranda or the doorstep" "I go crazy." "I go crazy." "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." - You moron! "Just leave if you can't do that." "On the floor, baby!" Dinesh, don't get upset. Can't you call her and tell her that you couldn't come due to extenuating circumstances? Do you have her number? - No. Don't you have it? No. She just has my number. Dinesh, how could you be so stupid! A girl wouldn't call you even if she says she would! You should have got her number and ensured it's the right one. She is neither going to call nor text you. Get lost! Bloody fool! Mom.. If you plan to advise me I will let you do it tomorrow morning. Please let me be for now. I am very sleepy. Swathi got married and she left. Can't you quit drinking at least now, Dinesh? Jeez! She isn't the reason I drank today. I'm not going to drink because of her. Aren't you happy now? Please leave. Excuse me. - Yes. I was thinking of getting married. What do you think? Go to sleep. Dad! How come he is playing music? It seems like he is happy today! He never wakes up so early. I don't know what happened to him today. Let me serve him tea. "I never realised that all I could see was you." I will send him to you. Please explain to him that he should mend his ways. All right. Send him. - Okay. We will advise him. - Okay. Call him. "You came.." She has come. "Oh, the bird of love!" Why do you do things that make you a laughing stock? What was the movie you'd watch to join the army? 'Vaaranam'? - 'Vaaranam Aayiram.' It wasn't because you were patriotic, right? Tea.. - Your interests keep changing, right, Dinesh? "This love.." Once you graduated, we made you look after the textiles shop. You were flirting with every single woman at the shop! Jeez. You lost all the money you earned in Dubai, in the stock market. Dinesh, your partners are waiting downstairs. Pay them what you owe. Go. If you don't have money, tell me and I will do it. Do it then. - Really? Why should I settle your debts! Go and meet them. Come on. They have shown up so early in the day. Good morning. Good morning. My money.. Come on. Dinesh, she has grown old. You should be more responsible. Let me get you some tea. - Okay. Dinesh. - What is it? - Just do whatever you want but pay us our money. - Dear.. I am pleading with you. You owe me lakhs of rupees! The stock exchange is at an all-time low. Really? - Sensex has taken a hit too. What do you expect me to do? - What did you say about sex? Shut up! I said Sensex and not sex! It is a technical term. - Hey. Mutual funds.. Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks. Read all scheme related documents carefully. What is it? - Just a procedure.. Dinesh, she has grown old. You should be more responsible. I know I am growing old.. - Move.. Don't you have anything else to tell him? 'Hi, Dinesh. Hope you are doing good.' 'It was so nice to meet you people. Had a wonderful time.' 'Will miss you guys!' 'Tell me if you come to Chennai.' 'All the best. Shoba.' Do one thing. Take him to Mumbai. - No.. Or you should take him to Dubai. - No. Terrorist attacks are frequent in Mumbai. It's so hard to survive there. - Yes! The climate in Dubai is horrendous. It's so hot and I struggle there. Excuse me, guys. - He won't bear it. I was thinking of doing a course about the national stock exchange. I reckon you are heading to Chennai. Excellent. - Can I do it in Chennai? I was considering going to Australia. - No. Do it in Chennai. - Correct.. The climate there is neither too hot nor cold. There won't be floods and it's free from mosquitoes. True. - There won't be terrorist attacks. Correct. - Yes. - It's a cool place. Yes. Okay. It is Chennai, then. Shoba. Shoba. Where is she? Shoba. Shoba? What are you doing here? Everyone is waiting for you and you are chopping vegetables here! Hey. Is there a problem between you and Dinesh? Only he knows what the problem is. How would I know? Do you know what's the biggest mistake I have made? I texted him, 'Miss you.' Why would he pack his bags and come here! That moron with him is the reason for everything. Who? Sagar. "Oh, girl.. Come with me." "Oh, girl.." 'Should I do it? - What..' "Oh, girl.." What is the problem now? Miss you.. Love you.. Like you.. Need you.. Women say that to every Tom, Dick and Harry! - They do. I came here for her and.. - And? S-She treated me like trash. She did. I postponed all my engagements to come here. My mother is alone there. Don't you remember the day we first met her? Those were the best days of my life. "I am coming to you, my city." "I am spreading my wings in your roads." "There are new dreams" "in my eyes because of you." "My life is entwined with happiness." "I came here in search of her." "You are the woman of my dreams.." "You are the woman of my dreams! You are." "You are the woman of my dreams.." "You are the woman of my dreams! "Oh, beloved.." "When I can't take my eyes off you.." "When your beauty bewitches me.." "We gave life to this precious friendship and let's cherish it." "These streets adorned by twilight.." "These shores that are illuminated by moonlight.." Yes! Dinesh, you are so careless. Shouldn't you have locked the door before going out? What if some other thief had got in instead of me! It's such a poor lodge, Dinesh. It's too hot and there are too many mosquitoes. Let it be. Look what I have brought for you! Jackfruit, coconuts and.. Where is it? Tapioca! Why don't you seem happy? What is your plan? Nothing. It's so boring without you at our hometown, Dinesh. You are having a great time here, aren't you? Way too many girls and photos. I know everything. Will you set me up with Shoba's friend, Priya? Shut up! "You are the woman of my dreams!" "You are the woman of my dreams! You are.." "You are the woman of my dreams.." "You are the woman of my dreams!" "You are the woman.." That's enough. Please eat. - I will. So, how do you guys like Chennai? Cool. - It's hot. I felt so. It is really hot. - Oh. Is that why you are wearing sunglasses? It's just.. Get rid of them. Funny guy. Chennai is more expensive than we thought. Actually, since there are two of you you guys can share the rent. - Yes. Really? He is broke. All he does is eat. Poor chap! Am I not right? Shoba, since he lacks common sense he utters nonsense all the time. So, his mother insisted that he should stay with me. He has learnt a bit from me. Am I not right? Let it be. How is your MBA coming along? It's not over. There is still a lot to tell you. It's so funny. Tell them one of your jokes. Let them laugh. Weren't you asking about the MBA, Priya? You know, my childhood dream was to become a pilot. My dad wanted me to be a doctor. When I grew up pilots and doctors lost their value. I thought of pursuing an MBA at College of Engineering. Yes, that's how it is. What's the full form of MBA? - What? Don't eat until you say it. He is joking.. Please eat. - No.. Stop eating until he says the full form of MBA. - Relax.. Relax, my foot. - Don't be crazy. Please eat. Forget MBA. - Please eat. - You wanted to be a doctor, right? You have to clear the entrance exams to be a doctor, moron! Relax, Sagar. He has flunked exams even after getting the question paper on the previous day! - No.. He can't even make a paper aeroplane. - Funny guy! Pilot, my foot! Dinesh, you are way too pompous when you are with girls. I have noticed it since fifth grade. - Relax. Priya's cake is here. - To heck with the cake! I can't be patient anymore! I am a roughneck when I have to be! - You are one! I won't spare you! - I will.. Stop it. - You.. Listen.. - Let me speak, Venkat. Why all this.. Who are they, Shoba? How could you let such reprobates be a part of our gang? He spoiled her birthday. Is he an IIT alumnus, a writer or an orator? Who is he? That's not important right now. Look at him staring at us. Such a disgrace. I warned you earlier. Okay. Now stop it. Don't irritate me. Wait. Let me go and talk to him. Shoba, it was accidental.. - See, it is not that funny. Yes. - We are in a public place. The two of you don't even have basic etiquette. Aren't you guys ashamed? You spoiled it, Dinesh. Forget it. Get a life. - Yes. You too. - Why me? Thank you. The audacity to say it! What? Even if I hadn't, Swathi would have told her that you aren't pursuing an MBA. A man could never read a woman's mind but I can do it. It's true. Because you aren't a man. Mr. Dinesh if you stop cracking stupid jokes and take life seriously the rest of your life will be good. Both she and her gang mocked me today. I will make them praise me. - Whatever. I am thinking of dropping this romantic plan. I am just going to work on some swag moves, man. Come on! Ma'am. - Yes. - Someone from Kerala has made a donation to our child welfare program. Really? Where is he now? - He is waiting outside, ma'am. "To alleviate the sorrows of children.." Do you work here, Shoba? We never knew. What's your plan? - What plan? Let's paint it green. - Helping the poor. We have always done charity. - I see. What is it? - Yes, Dinesh? Oh.. Hi, Shoba. Let's leave. We have too many places to visit. I know.. - I am waiting. He is such a nice guy. The signatures are different on both the cheques. Ask your friend to have a proper signature first. Save your charity until then. The problems of being undereducated.. That's enough. Give it.. For the sake of our friendship can you do me a small favour? What? How can I woo Shoba? I thought so. She likes you too. - Really? - Yes. Oh. But to make Shoba fall for you you should first make my wife fall for you. H-How can I do that to your wife.. - Oh, no. That's not what I meant. After Priya's birthday party it was my wife who criticised you the most. - Oh. If you impress her first, it'd be duck soup to woo Shoba. What? - It means easy.. Okay. Tell me how I can do it, pal. There is something that she likes more than me. What is it? Eat it, dear. - Hey, Dinesh. Kala! What a pleasant surprise! Do you like dogs? - I love them. Lolu, Monu and Sonu. Three dogs.. Oh! Okay. - I have brought food. Do you want some? - I love dogs too. - Really? This is Husky. - Wow! Hey, Husky. Vismaya.. Hey, Vismaya. Come here. - I will be right back. When will this end? What is happening there? They are moving into that home. They will be here henceforth. Really? Okay, guys. Thank you so much for a wonderful meal. Thank you. - Guys, tomorrow is Sunday. Diwali. It's the first Diwali after our wedding. Oh! - So, please.. All of you must come. Both of you must come. And let's celebrate. Let's celebrate. - All right, let's disperse now. Let's go.. - Thank you. Thank you.. - Thank you. - Bye. Thank you so much.. Okay. Bye. - Bye, girls. Yes. Just listen to me! Mom, call her tomorrow at 10 a.m. sharp. Okay? What's it, pal? You're making new plans. Your charity plan failed. But you managed the situation by getting dishes from the restaurant. Yes. - Since you're almost close to your goal shall we try to accomplish my goals? What goals? Can you set me up with Shoba's friend, Priya? Then we can live like a family. Drat! Bloody flirt! 'Dear, don't say anything.' 'I'll talk.' 'Just give me your father's phone number.' 'Okay, dear.' 'All right, then..' Sure, ma'am. Okay. Who was it? Dinesh's mother. Dinesh's mother? What does she want? She asked for my dad's contact number. What for? You didn't get it? Yes. Really? Really, pal. Wedding proposal. Wedding proposal! Don't think too much. Both of you look great together. He looks amazing. Please accept the proposal. He is wealthy. He cooks very well. He will take good care of you. Get settled, Shoba. Shall I go and give this 'Payasam' to Dinesh? What! Why? That's not needed. Just a minute. Yesterday, we had amazing food at his house. Go and give it. - Okay. What is it? - Nothing. Did you send the phone number? Drat! No. Oh! What about its peel? That's how it is. Are you trying to cheat me? I'm not that kind of a guy. - What? Then pack this. White carrot. Mr. Dinesh. - Yes. How are you? - Are you going to cook today as well? Cooking is my passion. - Yes. Here is some 'Payasam'. 'Payasam!' - Homemade. - Homemade! Also, your trick was a success. - Let me drink it. Your mother called her this morning. Really? - The discussion is going on. I came here in the middle of the conversation. Why? Did she give her the contact number? I don't know that, sir. Anyway, come to Ms. Kala's house for the Diwali celebration. Okay. - Have you seen Ms. Shoba make a Rangoli? No. - No, right? It's amazing. So, come without fail. - Okay. Okay, bye. - Okay, bye. You've moved here from your hometown just to flirt. Hey, get lost. "Lighted beautiful wicks" "are adding to the ambience" "and are looking amazing." "What is making you" "close your eyes and pray?" "A lot of smiles" "are getting added" "to the ambience of this house." "Whose presence is making" "those beautiful lamps smile?" "The alluring flame" "is dancing" "in the evening bliss." "Stars are twinkling" "even in the presence" "of a slight fragrant breeze." "Oh, magical dreams" "joining my soul!" "Do you feel like flying?" "A few" "beautiful moments.." "Who brought them?" "Lighted beautiful wicks" "are adding to the ambience" "and are looking amazing." "What is making you" "close your eyes and pray?" "A lot of smiles are adding" "to the ambience of this house." "Whose presence is making" "those beautiful lamps smile?" Hi, Shoba. It didn't rain, right? That's because this is Chennai. It would have rained if we were in Kerala. Mother called me this morning. Really? Whose mother? Dinesh's mother. My mother! Why? She wanted my dad's contact number. She said that she saw me at the wedding and she likes me. I can't believe mom. My mom is immature, Shoba. Also, she has the disadvantage of being born in a rural place. I'm really sorry for that. Shoba, actually I can't even imagine marrying someone without knowing and socialising with that person. So, I'm really sorry. I didn't give her my father's contact number. Why? Do you want me to give it? - I-It's up to you. As you said even I can't think about marrying a person without knowing the person well. See you. - Shoba. Are you free tomorrow? What is it, Dinesh? Let's have breakfast at Saravana Bhavan. Then let's go to Sathyam Theatre in the afternoon. - Oh. Tomorrow I'm not free. Well, even I'm not free tomorrow. I just recalled it when you said that. What about the day after tomorrow? - You're free, right? Tomorrow, I'll get drunk, sleep and then.. Okay, I'm free day after tomorrow. Okay. - Okay. "Is it like the Rangoli design" "that you make?" "Is it like the Rangoli design" "that you make?" "Tell me, oh, Moonlight." "The aroma that spreads" "when you apply sandalwood paste on you" "bewitches me." "Oh, Time, please don't move so fast." "Please stop for us." "Let happiness take control of me." "You are giving me" "nights that are more delightful than the day." "I don't want to lose this in this lifetime." "Someone whispered in my ear.." This is my mother and this is my father. They were not together for long. And I was not old enough to ask and understand their problems. They separated. Then, almost after a year, my mother passed away. It's been just dad and me since then. Yes, this is Priya. My father's close friend's daughter. We were in the same school, college and hostel. Priya had a relationship. But they also ended their bond a year after their wedding. They loved each other a lot before getting married. But everything ended once they got married. Since then, I'm a bit afraid of the concept of marriage. Dinesh, I really like you. Even the small things that you do give me a lot of happiness. I'm the happiest when I'm next to you. I don't know how to take this forward. Well, Shoba, by saying I like you.. Don't you know that I haven't considered you in that sense? I can assure you one thing. My ancestors have made enough money for me to take good care of you. So, I don't need to work. I'll always be there with you in our house. To support you and care you. I'll always have time for you. Let me ask you a casual question. Don't misunderstand me. - I won't. How are you always able to think along such lines? That's how I am. - Really? - Yes. Okay, come. This generation faces a lot of relationship issues. Verbal and physical abuse. Communication issues. Infidelity. Unnecessary arguments. But none of them is the major issue, Dinesh. Drugs and alcohol. Drinking and smoking must be banned. I swear. You're correct, Shoba. 'Wear helmets while driving motorcycles.' So.. So? Are you happy? Indeed. But you look upset. Didn't you like what I said? No! I loved everything that you said. As you said, the problems faced by the present generation such as alcohol and drug addiction is severe. I'm going to get addicted to life, Shoba. As you said, I'll cut down on alcohol for sure. That is not enough. Yes, I must quit. I must quit all the bad habits. I quit once in a while. So it'd be easy for me. Shall I go? Goodnight. Goodnight. Drat! "I want to feel you.." - Something is wrong. Oh, no! Alcohol. Addiction. No. How did he arrange these lights? You're shocked, right? We're going to celebrate your success this evening. I splashed the cash and bought all these expensive items. What's your opinion about this set-up? Nice. But I won't drink and I won't let you drink either. What? I understood that you don't want to drink. But I didn't understand why you're stopping me. You didn't understand? That means no one will drink alcohol in this house hereafter. Oh. That's her order, right? - Well.. Let's drink for one last time. She won't find out. No, I promised her. I never break my promise. I'll drink. I won't drink and I won't let you drink. I won't let it happen.. Stop that and come here. Okay, tell me.. I want to know all the details. What did you guys do? Where did you guys go? What did you guys talk? Please tell me.. Oh! Are you feeling shy? Really. Well did you tell him your demands? Yes.. What did he say? He agreed to it and left. Only God knows what is going to happen. I won't let that happen.. You shouldn't, Dinesh. Even banks don't put forth these many conditions to issue a loan. What else did she say? 'I like you'? I didn't understand its exact meaning. - I.. Okay, call him up. Let's listen to what he has to say. Shall we? - Yes. I slow down to.. Oh, no! It's Shoba.. Stop the music. Shoba. Dinesh, were you sleeping? No, I was watching television. What are you going to do next? Bath, eat and sleep. What! - I mean bath, eat and sleep. I just called casually. I'm also going to sleep as I have to leave early tomorrow. Okay.. See you.. Bye.. Goodnight. Do you want some? What did he say? Nothing. He is at home. Let's go. Play the music. "On the floor, baby." "Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "Get lost if you can't." "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "Get lost if you can't." "When I see you standing on the veranda or the doorstep" "I go crazy." "I go crazy." "I kept her close to me just like how women" "used to save money and keep it close to them" "but someone tricked me and took her away from me." "Stole her from me.." "On the floor, baby." "Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "Get lost if you can't." "On the floor, baby." "Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "Get lost if you can't." "On the floor, baby." "Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "Get lost if you can't." Don't make me recall all that. That makes me feel shy. Hey.. I would never have had a relationship with you even if what they assumed was true. What do I lack, Dinesh? Does that even matter now? - No. Is that her? - Who? Oh! She.. It's you. Where were you? I'm late as I couldn't get the parcel on time. 'I come in peace..' Women of this generation don't value anyone. Even ten-year-old relationships end when they get married and spend a few days together. They will love each other for the first six months. Then they forget the reason why they loved each other. How can we marry anyone in this era? Is there any guarantee that women won't betray us? We have to be very careful. We must be careful, Sagar. But you have been very careless, Dinesh. When my father used to fight with my mother he used to say that my mother and I are his two mistakes. Oh! Poor man. Tell me something, Dinesh. You fell in love with her. But what made her fall in love with you? Because I'm rich.. Every wealthy fool has girls around him. - Exactly. - Exactly. Dinesh do you know that the lives of many great people got ruined because of women? Even wars happened because of them. Really? - Just imagine a world where only men existed. We'll enjoy. Mr. Sagar. Just because they are born as women they are not allowed to fulfil their dreams and ambitions. While they grow up, they face eve-teasing by foolish men and they have to endure it. They are forced to get married to fools like you because of their parents. Women are forced to obey men. They carry babies for nine months. They experience pain and give birth to a baby. They raise the baby but they get rebuked even by their kids. Women are unlucky and divine. Give that to me. Thanks. - Shinoj. Calm down. You are just a driver. But we never treated you like that. But you're just a driver. How dare you drink our alcohol and lecture us? Get lost. Get lost. - One more. Just one more shot.. - Get out. How dare he lecture us! - Hey.. Don't force me to react. - Hey.. He was right. Get lost. - You shouldn't have kicked him out. What were we discussing? - Yes.. Shoba. Shoba. - Shoba. Nonsense. - Only her name is good. Yes. - She is a bad person. Exactly. - She is arrogant as she is beautiful and educated. She considers herself to be the most beautiful woman. It's all make-up. - Really? The beauty that she got by using tons of cosmetics.. We can also become handsome if we apply it. Really? - As for education.. She has no common sense. Can she write at least two words in her mother tongue, Malayalam? Can she? - Her English, poems and proverbs. English, my foot! Drat! Her conditions make me really angry. If I get hold of her right now.. What will you do? I'll slap her. Dinesh, do you really want her? Not at all.. You moron! He doesn't want you. Didn't you hear it? If you ever trouble him saying that you love him I won't spare you. Do you hear me? Are you listening? There might be many people who obey you. Keep your foolish conditions to yourself! I'll get my friend married to a woman who has no demands at all. I'm losing my temper. Hang up. I taught her a lesson.. Who was that? - It was her. Who? Shoba. "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby. Get lost if you can't." "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby. Get lost if you can't." "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby. Get lost if you can't." 'Sir. - Shanmukham.' 'I gave a letter stating that' 'I've no complaints against you.' 'I got to know that.' 'In the end, none of us got her, right?' 'Mister, someone is surely waiting for us somewhere.' 'There was Sonia Gandhi from Italy' 'to become the wife of an Indian, Rajiv Gandhi.' 'There was Ms. Usha from Burma who became the wife' 'of ex-President K R Narayanan, a Keralite.' 'Not just that. Mohanlal got married' 'to Suchitra, who is from Tamil Nadu.' 'Likewise, there might be someone' 'waiting for us somewhere.' 'One day, we will meet..' Actually, you did a good thing. I was waiting to say all of this to her someday. She might have understood that I can live without her. Shall I call her up? If you can live without her, why do you want to call her? Well, we must know her current state of mind, right? Call anyone you want. Do as you wish. But please spare me. What do you want? You said everything that you wanted to, right? Now, listen to me. I hate you, Dinesh. That's enough. Tell me and let's end it. 'Shoba.' D-Dad! - 'Where are you, dear?' A-At Priya's house. 'When are you coming here?' I'll come, Dad. 'Did you eat?' - Yes. 'Is there a problem?' No, nothing as such, Dad. 'Discuss and sort it out, no matter what it is.' Okay, Dad. 'Come fast, dear.' - Okay. Okay. Hey, what happened? I ruined it. I blabbered some nonsense to my dad thinking that it was Dinesh. What are you saying? I think my dad understood that there is a problem between Dinesh and me. Are you guys playing the fool? You guys understand each other so well. Why can't you both give in? I'm quite serious. This is just ego. Relationships are all about happiness. But I've never seen you both be happy together. What's the point then? Okay, give me your phone. Let me talk to Dinesh. Well, I just mentioned him. And he is calling up. Hello, Dinesh. After everything that happened, I don't think we should waste time by calling each other unnecessarily. I just called you to know your decision. What's your decision? What! Dinesh, I'm Priya. Priya, give the phone to Shoba. Listen to me first. What do you think about women, Dinesh? If you can't even respect a woman then why do you guys need relationships and love? She told you her conditions but you didn't even care about them. What do you think of yourself? Do you consider yourself a great guy? What! Nonsense. How dare you! You.. Priya. Hang up! Priya is so silly. Where did you find him? He is so annoying! Oh, God! Well, let me ask you something. Do you really want her or not? I.. - You don't want her? I want her. So, you want to be with her. Yes. You blamed her so much and now, you want her, right? She brought so many changes in your life. Actually those were the best days of your life. Bye.. S-Shoba.. He insisted last night. That's why I.. Will you do anything if he insists? He insists only about this. Who is your priority, him or me? You're my priority. He is my second priority. So, you want him too, right? Actually, what bond do you guys share? Bond! What bond? You might not have anything as such on your mind. But I seriously doubt that guy. Forget it. Just be careful. What do you mean? You'll understand soon. My dad is coming. Tomorrow, you must accompany me to the airport. Really? Wow. When is that guy coming? Guy? - No, I mean, your father. 6:30 a.m. sharp. 5:30 a.m. sharp. - Uncle, the bottle. Uncle? I don't know why but people always doubt me when I say that I'm her dad. Do you have any such doubt? Yes. - Hey! What's wrong with you, Dad? What nonsense are you saying? Shoba, it's all right. He is my would-be son-in-law. Okay, you guys keep talking. I'll be right back. Dinesh, tell me. How are you, sir? I'm fine. What else? Is it raining in your hometown? Wait. I'll ask someone and tell you. - No.. It was just a general question. I don't know such things, sir. I'm always busy travelling with regard to my business. America to Japan. Japan to Delhi. Delhi to America. Delhi? Where in Delhi? You live in Delhi, right? - Yes. I go from Delhi to Chennai as soon as I land in Delhi. Going to Delhi is just a transit trip. You run a stock.. - Yes.. Basically, I'm a stockist, sir. But not an ordinary one. I play brilliantly by learning and understanding the business. I'm an internationally acclaimed expert I invest lakhs of rupees and earn crores in return. Let me tell you something. The daily turnover of the company in which I have invested is around Rs. 25 Crores to 30 Crores. Which company? Well.. Glenfiddich. It's a Scottish airline company. Oh.. I'll be free by this evening. - Okay. Shall we meet? - Okay. Do you drink? What do you mean, sir? Well, do you drink alcohol? Alcohol. Only if someone insists.. I drink occasionally. Just 30 or 60 millilitres. I insist. I could use some company. She.. - She won't find out. I'll call you this evening. Okay, sir. Dinesh, we will leave. Dad, shall we leave? Yes. - I'll drop you on the way. Okay? - Okay. Okay, Dinesh. See you. - Okay, sir. Okay, see you. Okay. Cheers! Cheers! Sir, let me tell you something. I never touched this poison until I was 15. Swathi. I loved her so much, sir. She betrayed me. Who is Swathi? Don't you know her? Your daughter's friend, Swathi. I met Shoba at Swathi's wedding. Will you say that you don't know Shoba as well? Will you say that? It's Sagar, my friend.. He comes to me shamelessly no matter where I'm. Where were you? - Hello. Shall we leave? You like whisky, right? Waiter. - Yes. What is it, sir? Get him a shot of whisky. - Sorry, sir. It is out of stock. We will have it tomorrow. Is it out of stock? Go.. I'll give you a gift before you leave. I'll also give you a gift. Wow! If you don't want to drink brandy then I'm taking it. Amazing. The way you're looking at me is making me feel uncomfortable. Come, let's go. I'm feeling sleepy. Oh, no! I said what I had to. What quality did you find in him? I'm just curious to know. Dad, he will take good care of me. That's enough for you, right? Go without any worries. I'll transform him. Fine. I don't have a long life ahead. So, I won't have to witness much. That's the only thought which gives me peace. Be careful, dear. Okay. Oh, no! Drat! Did he leave? He could've waited for a bit, right? Shoba. Shoba, walk slowly. Your dad is different from what I expected. You're like your mother, right? Next, both of us will go and meet him at his place. That will make him happy. - Not necessary. He hates you. Last night, you got drunk and said some nonsense, right? You fool.. What are you saying, Shoba? I don't understand. When did I drink? Don't act innocent. It's evident. When he insisted, I drank a bit to keep him company. Your father drank a lot. Do you know he is a drunkard? You moron! My father never consumed alcohol. He is a teetotaller. Teetotaller! Sorry, Shoba. I swear on you, me and the children we are going to have that I won't drink from today. What are you holding? Spray. - Spray? It's too big. - Full body spray. It was a gift for your dad. - Show it. No. - Show it. - It's a deodorant. - No. You won't change! Shoba, I'll buy a teetotaller if you want! Teetotaller.. You old fool! Stay, Shoba.. Shoba. Oh, God! Two. - Tell me the truth. How many shots did you have? Five. Five. I had five as well. So, he didn't drink, did he? - What's the matter? He told Shoba that I'd got drunk last night. Drat.. You are a nuisance once you get drunk. You went to impress him but the situation is depressing. It's okay. I'm here to help you. He behaved like a girl. Dinesh, I'm here for you. Never ever do that. Idiot. What shall we do now? Dinesh. You've no clue what I can do. We'll impress Shoba and her father within the next 24 hours. I swear on Lord Ayyappan! I promise. Hail Lord Ayyappan. Everyone makes mistakes, Shoba. I'll find divinity by surrendering myself and my worldly life to the Lord through fasting for 41 days. What was the next sentence? God gives His hardest battles to His toughest soldiers. Let me battle for God as I'm His toughest soldier. Aren't you surprised? I know that you're surprised. This is nothing. You'll see many such amazing surprises. Hail Lord Ayyappan. Let me pray. Hail Lord Ram.. "It sparkles and shines." "It sparkles and shines." This is a huge surprise. I'm so happy. Many more surprises await you, Shoba. We will live in this apartment when we come to Chennai once in a while after our wedding. See, Dinesh.. I can't leave Chennai suddenly and return to our hometown. My business is established here. I also have a lot of commitments. And Priya is all alone here, isn't she? Priya? She can take care of herself. I had dreamed about the hometown, village, my mother and business, you know.. - Dinesh, today is a good day. Should we be discussing this today? That's true. But shouldn't we discuss our wedding too? Mother is relentlessly calling me. - Oh, I forgot. I have some shopping to do. Let's get it done quickly. Come. Shoba, I was planning some more surprises. That's when you said these things and.. I was thinking about getting the apartment furnished. Let's not do it now, Dinesh. Don't waste money. No, money isn't an issue. On second thought, everything in our hometown.. We have Lulu Mall, the metro, and new airports. We have everything we need. All of that has been here for a long time. Come here. I was just.. - You're a Malayali, aren't you? Yes. If you are done ogling, shall I take her along? Yes, please. I will beat you up, you swine! Hail Lord Ayyappan. - Hail Lord Ayyappan. Get lost. - Thank you. I will be right back. Hey. Isn't that Shoba? Y-Yes. Is she with you now? All right, then. Hey. Let's go. Let's go. Dinesh, try this. It's really nice. It's not that nice. I didn't like it. What's your problem now? What problem could I have? Besides, it's something that I have to deal with on my own. You are always busy with messages, calls, meetings.. Dinesh, what is this? I'm free after the product launch on the day after tomorrow. Shoba, that's not the issue right now. That woman.. I mean, I am fed up of making excuses to mom. She is always asking about the wedding. It's up to you now. But I spoke with her yesterday. She didn't say anything to me, Dinesh. Whose mom? Why are you calling my mom? I don't like anyone else calling my mom. I completely hate it, you know. - Okay.. Relax.. Shall I order a drink for you? Don't try to get me drunk. Just a second. It's an urgent phone call. "She is like a chest of unsolved mysteries." "I will not let you go." "I will not let you go, baby." "She is like a chest of unsolved mysteries." "I will not let you go." "I will not let you go, baby." "She is a cunning fraudster." "I will not let you go." "Yes, I will not let you go, baby." "I'm never going to give up." "I'm never going to suck up." "I will find out the truth. You watch out, baby." "I'm never going to give up." "I'm never going to suck up." "I will find out the truth. You watch out, baby." "She is like a chest of unsolved mysteries." "I will not let you go." "I will not let you go, baby." "I'm never going to give up. "I'm never going to suck up." "I will find out the truth." You watch out, baby." "I'm never going to give up." "I'm never going to suck up." "I will find out the truth. You watch out, baby." Hey, stop.. Hey. Is it him? No. Get lost.. Dinesh. - Yes. If he asked you whether she is with you now doesn't it mean that she was with many other guys before? No.. That's not what I meant. But still, when someone asks you such things.. Just let this one go, Dinesh. - Where have I seen him before? He looked familiar. Hey. Where's the nearest bar? Take the first left turn and then, turn right. Okay. Lucky guy. It's him. There he goes. Let him go and drink. That's the guy. Get on the motorcycle. Let's go.. Hurry up. "I'm never going to give up." "I'm never going to suck up." "I will find out the truth." "You watch out, baby." - Hey, go and make him understand.' He is repeating it. "I will find out the truth. You watch out.." How do you know Shoba? Did you ask me something? How do you know Shoba, sir? He told me to ask you. I like how brave you are. I like how haughty you are. But I don't like your face at all. Why, sir? Shoba. Shall we sit down and talk? Didn't we meet two days ago? Guys, he is the new guy. Well, you look very innocent. I am wondering how to tell you. Fine. Nowadays, even average looking women have three guys pursuing them. Even they attract people. So, obviously, beautiful girls will have many men pursuing them. Fifty? Twenty? Let's say, ten. Consider half of them. The girl would avoid them by saying that she considered them to be friends or brothers. Out of those ten guys she might like at least one. There will certainly be someone. She would have no respect for him. Because she knows well that there will be another one if he leaves. Think about it, pal. Think about it. Shoba. Isn't she pretty? How many conditions did she put forth to you? Tell me, my friend. My friend, we are all men. Our nature is similar.' We may be dark but our hearts are pure. See you. Hey, let's go. "The boss is here." "The boss is here." "The boss is here." "The boss is here." "The boss is here." "The boss is here." Doctor, does he have ulcer? Really? He is drunk so early in the day! If he gulps down a bottle of alcohol as he did early in the day he would end up with cancer, not ulcer. That means he is all right, isn't he? - You.. Excuse me, by the way, I am also a doctor. Okay? Dinesh.. Look. I asked them to come. Aren't you happy? Well.. S-Shoba, actually.. "You're the glowing light" "in my heart." - Shoba, just relax. Calm down. - "When I travel" "through different paths.." "Your image is the only thing that I see." "The surroundings are filled with memories." "I was filled with joy every day." "Even while searching for the shore which was far away" "you guided me" "like a ray of hope." "You mean the world to me." Everything will be all right, Dinesh. Shoba belongs to you, Dinesh. Convey my regards to Sagar. Take care. Did I tell her all that? Shoba, do you know that even my mom hasn't slapped me? That's why you're so reckless, Dinesh. Did you call me early in the morning to say this? - Dinesh.. Tell me where you are. Shoba, just tell me why you called. Let's get married, Dinesh. Marriage? Get married.. I knew that it would end up like this. That's not what I said. Let us get married. Are you sure about this? - I am, Dinesh. Promise? I promise. Good decision. At least now, tell me where you are. Me? I have no clue. I'm on top of a hill. I can only see hills here. I'll ask someone and call you back. "My dream has come true." "Your dream has also come true." "Our dreams have come true." "My dream has come true." "Your dream has also come true." "Our dreams have come true." "My dream has come true." "Your dream has also come true." "Our dreams have come true." "My dream has come true." "Your dream has also come true." "Our dreams have come true." "My destiny is coming to pass." "My dreams are coming true." "Let's break free from our confinements." Hey, Venkat! Where are you, buddy? Are you downstairs? I will come. I'll be there right away. "Your dream has also come true. - Our dreams have come true.." Hey, buddy! - Hey! How are you? How's everything going? I've arranged a big party. Come inside and drink. - Oh. I have got some work. I just thought of meeting you on the way. Just have a shot. I'll drink more than one if I come upstairs. You know that, buddy. Let's party on the day of the wedding. Is that so? Okay. Okay. See you tomorrow. - Have fun.. - Bye.. Careful.. Go.. Go.. Okay. Bye. Dinesh. - Yes. Dinesh.. Yes. I'm Dinesh. Your wedding is on the day after tomorrow, right? Yes. Who are you? You must be really happy, right? She meant the world to me. But she didn't want me. She wanted my money. After I agreed to all her conditions and when we were about to get married.. She went to her hometown under the pretext of attending a friend's wedding. But later, I found out that her wedding was fixed with some wealthy guy. What I said now is about Shoba the one you're going to marry, Dinesh. If I come and say this just before your wedding you might think I'm a fraud. I understand. Ask Shoba if she knows Rohan when you have time, Dinesh. She wouldn't have forgotten me by now. Bye. So, this guy is Rohan. Why didn't you discuss this with me after what happened yesterday, Dinesh? My wedding is supposed to happen after two days. I can't bear to watch my dad get humiliated in front of everybody. He doesn't deserve it. I don't know why he backed out in the last minute. He's suspecting me just because a guy told him something. Am I such a bad person? I just wished to live happily with him. Ma'am. 'Don't forget to try on the dresses I had sent.' 'Tell me if any alterations have to be made.' Okay. 'Why do you sound upset, dear?' - No.. I-It's nothing. - 'That's not true.' 'There's some problem.' 'Why do you sound upset, dear?' 'Dear..' I'll call him, dear. Hello? - Hand over the phone to Dinesh. I'll give it to him. Your mom.. - Tell her that I'm not here. I think she has found out everything. Yes. - Is there any truth in what I heard? Why are you hurting her so much? She is in tears. Are you going to come here or should I come there? What do you know, Mom? Does this mean you trust her? I'm coming. Call her too. Let's first take a decision about this. Come! Stop there. What are you doing in the last minute after asking all these people to come to Chennai? She is crying. Nobody is aware of this now. If you don't settle this before tomorrow morning.. Dinesh.. - Where is she? Who is this, Shoba? I don't know. Don't you know who this person is? - I don't know. Don't you know that he is Rohan? I don't know, Dinesh. Why would a stranger say such things about you? Or are you saying that I cooked up this story? What should I deduce from this photo? Lower your voice, Dinesh. - Why? I'm not going to keep quiet. Don't think you can fool me so easily. Don't think we can take another step until you tell me who he is and what is your relationship with him. Or else, we can just end this right here. What? End it? How can I tell you about something that I don't know? I don't know him.. Shoba. I don't know what's the problem between you both. Both of you fell in love with each other and fixed this wedding. If the situation is like this now there will be more problems after your wedding. Sir, please.. You don't have to get involved in this. You won't understand anyway. This is so annoying.. What would I not understand? Even though a lot of time has passed the problems between men and women have remained the same, Dinesh. After falling in love and dreaming about life you get married. But while finding out the realities of life if a bond isn't formed between a husband and a wife it will shatter the foundation of the relationship. Philosophies like these only sound good. Why wasn't that foundation created in your life? For how long did you live with your wife? Stop it, Dinesh! I.. I hate you, Dinesh. Let's go, Dad. Dear.. Let it go, buddy. Just consider that you escaped a catastrophe. It's not that I don't know how to ruin her life by creating a problem using this. But.. I fell deeply in love with her, buddy. Chennai.. Shall I leave, buddy? Lady on the rocks.. That was a nice plan, buddy. Dinesh went to his hometown. You should've seen Shoba's face. She was crying. It would've made you happy if you had seen it. How did you do it, buddy? I just asked one question. 'Is she with you now?' A small spark. Did you see how I ignited it? But Dinesh's condition makes me feel bad. Okay.. He's innocent. But his lover.. Shoba.. Didn't she ruin our lives? It's karma, buddy. This is how karma strikes back. Now, she must have realised our pain, right? Priya and I were in love for six years. She ruined it in just six months. You come home late every day. You say that you went somewhere with Shoba. You keep roaming around with her. Why? Will you only listen to her? Will you give it to me only if she asks you to? That wretched woman! If you speak ill of her again I will not spare you! I'll.. - Ravi! She's not going to stay with you for another day. Come. It has been one and a half years since I last saw Priya. She left me in the lurch. Apparently, she doesn't need me anymore. Forget that, buddy. Your plan has worked out. What are you still thinking about? Celebrate. Where's our hero? Villain. Suman? - Yes. I am Suman! I can do anything! Cheers! I might be a drunkard, a bad guy and a playboy. But I.. I will stand by my friend when he's in trouble. I taught that girl, who ruined your life, a lesson! Do you know why I did this? Why? Don't you know it either? Tell me why. It's because you're my friend. Friend.. I trust you. Can we click a selfie, buddy? Let's click it. A selfie, right? Let's click a selfie happily.. Venkat started boozing. We could've boozed too. Isn't it going to be a long drive? Do you have the photos of that guy with Shoba? It's inside that. Did they know each other? Such a small world, right? Dinesh, look at this. How come this guy is with them? Suman. Hey, Suman! What's wrong? - Get up. Get up.. - Wait.. Did you upload that photo on Facebook? Yes, buddy. I tagged you as well. Idiot! Dinesh has commented on the photo. Dinesh.. Who is he? I'm talking about Dinesh! Show it. 'You scoundrels!' What does that mean? It's an expletive, buddy. Profanity.. He's going to come here. Let him come. If he comes here, he'll not leave this place alive. Ask him what he wants. Two bottles of beer and a plate of beef roast. He's here with a purpose. Hey! Take him out, guys! "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "On the floor, baby. Hit it hard, baby." "Rock the party, baby." "On the floor, baby.." Hello, police station? - 'Yes.' Sir, some goons are here and they're being savage. A brawl is going on here, sir. My friends are bleeding and they're crying helplessly. - 'Is that so?' 'Where are you?' - We're in Colours Bar, sir. 'Girls?' - Sir, not girls.. Colours, sir.. Love.. Action.. Drama.. Where's love in this story? Hey! Aren't you a comedian? You look exactly like one. Hey! Do you know what is love? Love is simple. It's also powerful. How would guys like you understand such emotions? Sir, I would've married her and taken her to my hometown. They could've lived happily with their wives then, right, sir? Is that your plan? - Yes.. Tell me if that's your plan. - Yes, sir. Hey! Listen to him! That's his plan. Why did you do it then? Well.. - Sir, how would we know his plan? Correct. How would they know it? His wife is instigating that guy's wife. His wife is instigating the other guy's wife. My wife is creating problems for me! Isn't one guy responsible for creating all these problems? Where is he? - Excuse me, sir. Who is that? This guy? Come.. I'm Suman, sir. I'm the one who called you and asked you to come there. Don't you remember me? Colours? Come here.. - I'm coming, sir. Don't worry. Buddy, I'm here. Sir, where did you go after asking us to come there? A lot of action took place on the beach, sir. I was covered with dust. I thought of taking a bath before meeting you. I was looking for you. - Sir.. Sir.. - Were you taking a bath after ruining the lives of three people? I'll make you take a bath here! Hey! - Sir.. - Make him take a bath! Sir, I'm innocent. Please leave me. Sir.. Sir, please let me go. Please.. I didn't do anything. You've arrived. Aren't you Shoba? - Yes, sir. Did you see how I identified her? See how I did it! - Yes, sir. Ma'am, you mean the world to your lover. But these morons ruined your wedding. You're not supposed to settle your family problems here. You're supposed to settle this outside. All right? So, get out! Okay, sir. Thank you. - Hey! Where are you going? - They're my friends, sir. Let them go. - Hey.. My friends are leaving, sir. Hey. - I'll be your friend. Come with me. I did it because I love you. - That's enough! I'm extremely sorry. Don't say another word! - Will you never reform? I can't take this anymore. - I'm sorry. I can't take this anymore. - Shoba.. Shoba.. Listen to me. Can you say that you aren't guilty at all? They ruined my life as well because they hate you. I shouldn't have doubted you because of some stranger. I made a mistake, Shoba. Shoba, we have problems because we love each other a lot, right? Shoba.. Say something! Isn't everything over, Dinesh? What did you tell my dad? Didn't you believe what a stranger told you, Dinesh? Is that what you think about me? I might forget everything with time. But I can't trust you again.. My time and effort.. That signifies a relationship for me. The most important thing that a woman needs is the trust that her man has for her. That trust gives a woman the courage and strength to live on. The ones whom I loved, have always left me, Shoba. The fear that I would lose you made me do everything. My inferiority complex and possessiveness.. I might have all that until the day I die. But, Shoba.. Don't leave me in this situation. If you leave me, I'll be devastated, Shoba. Please. Please trust me. Please. Will you drink again? - No. I will not drink again. Will you smoke? - I won't smoke. Convince my father. Shoba.. Sir.. - What? - Is this enough, sir? Continue.. Sir! - Shut up and take your bath. Sir! Was this necessary? I had asked you that very day. I asked if we could live together like a family. I'm of no value now. Mr. Sagar.. Mr. Dinesh.. Cheers! I'll be right back. - Do you have to go so early? "I set my eyes on her the moment I saw her." "A dream that I have had for a long time." "The ocean with high tides" "and the forest filled with darkness" "became pathways in this journey." "I don't feel anything wrong" "when she's becoming mine" "after falling in love with her."

"The ocean with high tides" "and the forest filled with darkness" "became pathways in this journey." Sir, please forgive me. I made a mistake. Doesn't every human make mistakes? You must've made many mistakes too. Doesn't she need someone to take care of her after you die? I'll take good care of her, sir. Please forgive me. Why are you looking at me like that? I'm feeling strange. I won't let you go until you forgive me. Tell me that you've forgiven me. - P-Please stand up, Ganesh. Ganesh? Not Ganesh.. My name is Dinesh. D-Dinesh.. - You forgot me, sir. Stand up, Dinesh. - Please forgive me. Stand up. Did you forgive me? - Yes. - Tell me that you have. I forgive you, Dinesh. Stand up. When something goes wrong some nincompoops come forward to give advice. They're the actual troublemakers, sir. I-I wasn't referring to you, sir. After all.. After all.. 'A perfect marriage is' 'two imperfect people' 'refusing to give up on each other.' 'You cannot scroll down without liking this picture, sir.' It's Shoba.. Say 'Okay' to her.. It's Shoba.. Please say 'Okay' to her.. Okay. Ganesh.. - Shoba.. Sorry.. Dinesh.. "I don't feel anything wrong" "when she's becoming mine" "after falling in love with her."
