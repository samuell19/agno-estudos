Torpedo For Christ's sake. What's going to happen now? I am not sure. Your mother. From this time on you to answer to me. Please help me. Hello? Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. What do you want with us here? You are here for a reason. I am. Can be here. You, intelligence and military police control Captain Kobayashi, commanding officer needs to listen to Captain's words with care. You are to be treated well, given good food and pleasant place to live. All that we ask is that you dove and recover silver vessels. He should be informed. We are all aware of your skill in underwater work. You can now use your skills to our benefit. If you refuse, you die. I pressed on United States Navy diver number one and demolition expert Robert Fletcher, United States Navy diver, first class. So, Dawson and look, Colonel Sterling, SWAT team. He does not wish to threaten. It is his duty. It is better to be treated. Well than to die for not cooperating. Excuse me, sir. He said something about silver. What silver? Before we took Corregidor. No navy dumped silver petals. It is our desire to retrieve it. What's wrong with using your own divers? That is no concern of yours. You need only to be concerned with staying alive. Seems like you're giving us no choice. You have no choice. Food. Drink this. Things will be brought to this rest. No place comfortable for yourselves. Make them Americans die. My men took special care to build you a fine house. What's your name? So there's a. Lot of you guys cut the bullshit. Is this where we. Yes. Very fine. Excuse me, but where do I stay? That is very frank. How much you can expect an officer to live in the same house? The Negroes, can you? But he had this right. My man took special effort to make you Americans comfortable. I don't care what the circumstances are. We don't bunk down with Negroes on the ship. They have their quarters. We have our quarters. Is that clear? That is loud and clear. But this ain't no ship. And it surely ain't no United States, no God damn America. And as tight as I am, and I ain't taking orders from nobody except them Japanese. Listen, there's one point you all should understand. This may be a prisoner of war camp, all right? But we're still in the Navy. As far as I'm concerned. Nothing has changed. You are surely right about that. Listen, I don't know what you guys are going to do, but I'm going to stay here and I want you to understand it. Like DuPont, somebody. Don't you think an exception is needed here. Man, I do not understand you. You stand up, let the cat talk to you like that. After you, sir. It's all yours, sir. You got room for one more six oh. It's important we talk. Please. No matter how you find things underwater, make it look hard to get. Hey. What do you mean? Don't explain. No, please. Trust me. What was that all about? I bring you greetings from Captain Kobayashi and pleasurable food and drink. Oh, well, I haven't got it all. This number one. Best Japan wine drink. Oh, yes. Very good rest. Plenty rest tomorrow. You must be ready to start diving early. Oh, you. Excuse me. Jesus Christ. What is this? Grand Central Station of something? This is not my thing. You want, Lieutenant. Now the Japs are insisting I live in this place. Are you Fletcher? Fletcher. You think you can handle that compressor, Lieutenant? Stuff works pretty well under normal pressure. 66. 83. After 83, nobody knows. How come you show how you, say, knowledgeable about this gear? Well, in civilian life, I worked as a test, left Detroit and went to Florida for three years. Well, they tested this stuff. Good job. Sure was. To a pearl Harbor. Yeah. After that, the Navy got a select enough piece. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, though, be careful, man. It's rough down there. And look out for sharks. Who? All right, guys. Gonna fucking blow the. Yeah, that stuff is sitting there like candy. It could get to it. Yeah. No. All right. You know, the rest of those great, awfully deep currents down there? Murder. Well, I have to readjust all this equipment to handle the out of depth signal processor. Still got it. We will spend the rest of their thumb fixing gear. The make problem in morning continued diving. Yes. Yeah, sure. Yes, sir. I got a day's pay for you boys at work. It. Captain Kobayashi is most pleased with teamwork and impressed with effort. And you. Are also very impressed. How do you feel it's going well. As can be expected, you must. Tomorrow you and your men will recover even more. Shiver. Hey, wait a minute. What did you mean? You and your men? I'm the officer here. How? One does not determine leadership ambitions, bases of rank and status, but rather by a manner in which a man carries himself. He's just a sailor. This has been your leader since arrival. His most logical choice to school. But than. The God damned in school. For one. Gentlemen, I have decided to allow the priest, the Filipino crew wishes to invite Americans to lechon dinner song. Cycle, please. Thank you. Why the meeting, Toto? I was hungry. What romantic would trust before it's too late I belong to the resistance What resistance? Filipino fighters element of silver coins. We need them to buy things. How about people? The you and free prisoners of war? That's all fine, Toto, but I ain't no hero. Listen, you help us get the shipment of fishing village in Bataan and my people will hide. Joe, until the war's over. You got to be kidding. Why don't you just ask us to fly just up to the moon? Mister, don't think you're safe here. You're not. If I don't come up with the plan through, the resistance will destroy the barge and the camp. We will sleep now. Early morning dog. I sleep tonight. You must think of fish or something You can't threaten me like that It is no threat I am giving you fact Either you help us or we all die. Hey, cool. You better tell us how we're going to get that silver to the fishing village. I mean, what do we swim underwater? You know, some deal might not be a bad idea. You guys are crazy. I'm going to find my own way to escape to where? Don't talk to me like that, sailor. Now, wait a minute, my man. You do whatever you want to when we get out of here. But until then, don't mess with my mind either. We. You mind telling me how we're going to pull this one off? Seems all we can do is stall. Wait for break. Break. Hey, we don't need a break. We need a miracle. You know? You know what we need? We need a top marine engineer and a marine sled. SLED. And I. Wait a minute. I'll just wait a minute. With a little bit of luck and a whole lot of ingenuity, we can help that resistance. Yeah. Come on. I thought you were strictly. Things stand now. Where did we help of Japanese? But if we can figure out a way to help that resistance and Toto owes us a way to escape. Right? Right. A marine sled. She all better do that. They already know. All right, I got. We have right to make you say a lesson and comfortable as possible. However, some of you have used this as special treatment and mistook our kindness for weakness. It is therefore necessary to set an example to avoid future misunderstandings like when they. Oh, very good. Oh, good, good, good, good. Oh. Oh, oh. You guys got to be kidding. I wonder you're having problems. You're limited. Not for deeply diving, scientific. Maybe these men are marine engineers. They may help improve the gear. How much time George can do? Unbelievable. As a demolition man. Oh, look now to America for maybe a couple of days. That'll give him just enough time to fix that equipment. It makes sense. I will give you the time. We will all cooperate. The boys are going to love the camp. Just like a country club. With an underwater breathing device. Are you sure we can swim all the way over there and. With the right parts? I just put one together. Boys in Washington are playing around with an idea to glue kind of rebreather. Rebreather? Yeah. We improvise. I can get the sounds of, you know, what would you need? Gas mask with filters and rubber tubing and small stuff. Nuts and bolts and stuff. Scraps, stuff we left behind when they took over, taking. That's all. Now go to school. That's where the airbag goes. I'm sure that'll work. A little work. And it's crude, but it's interesting. But that's all fine. George, we have one problem. How are we going to get over there without the Japanese missing us? Wait a minute. If you had all night with the distance, mother. No, simply a matter of preparation, then it can be done. Hey, we've got company. Well, find it and assess the value. Well, we're just making a list of all the materials we need. Where to find this material outside. My God, America. This is a things left behind. Very interesting. But who will find these things? Well, Robert. George, Leroy and Toto. Oh, yes, of course, Harry. Right. Very clever. It makes us trip in mourning, find everything. You must have in mind. The Japanese military, very patient this time, must not fail to meet the demand to survive, must some time in with passing, when? What was that all about? Well, I'd like to win. The man says his trouble. Toto, you said the other way. Yes. Come on, I'll show you. Yeah. Keep an eye out on the big well. Right. What is it? Go to look around. It turns over the cave facing the sea just above the water waterline. After building they had to broke through to the cave the way to escape in case the camp had to be destroyed. What's to stop us from using it? Nothing. There was only one place to go. But then, if you escape without hoping. My people only. Okay, to that. George can come up with a plan. You got a deal. Right? See you in the morning. You got me, George. Come here to the barge. The barge, the button. And then back all the way. Whatever planning you can do it. Do you think there's anything left to salvage in the top act? You men have no idea what you're talking about. There's tons of equipment left up there. That right. You go skills. That's the only item I'm worried about. Wow. Oh, God. Your word I usually get panicky. Whoa, whoa. Oh, no, I can't use the summit. Wow, wow, wow. All to the undertaker. All good job. What? I can turn. Wow. Oh, yeah. Oh, what? I'm telling you, if it's a man and ain't nothing but a heartbreaker he's got one fantastic undertaker, a young man. Yeah, I mean, she's way run by. Strangers for not being almost. Some time in your life. You must got skin good. Real good. Why so important? Uh, hey, George. Oh, yeah. Well, when they're filled with compressed air and then attach to the silver crates and speeds of the surfacing of the silver crates and gas masks. Oh, that's. Standby equipment for the dove in that. The most inventive, very pleasing to see. So good cooperation. Please continue without interruption. Come back. My assignment. Tomorrow night. Clyde better warrant a. Free go tomorrow night. With a shipment The works My people are ready Just look for the American flag What a marker underwater at least to go up. Surface I'm under. Immense reply We'll be ready to roll. Heading under for a long time. They're checking the mask at lower depth and make sure you got a good connection into the goat skin. Got it. Got it. Okay. Don't forget to bring it. That's life. Now, what about you, Leroy? Bring me anything. Good Mudder. He's heading for the waterline now. I'm sure he knows what you're all going to try and do. At least we're trained in us. And it's botched here, sailor. Karen had right crap a little too far, as you well know, Fletcher, just to say to you one day, I'm not on any side, mister. I'm just trying to stay alive. That's all right. LT Working together is our only chance. You can believe me. When this is all over, I'm going to personally see that you're all court martial. When this is all over, you can have your court martial not get with it. Lieutenant. See you for breakfast, boys. Cool. If they're caught, the Japs are going to kill all of us. All doing your. My name is Snyder Grass. So do I send his best in China? I completely. I know him well. I, you know, globetrotting. Is great for America and you want to express in. I understood the call in order. For the undergrounds in Manila how do they get stuff in place tucked in a stinking baskets of seafood? Oh, you've been fucking done before us. The good. The bad. They line them. Who gets it in Manila? I do. Have that data signal in north. A sister she has a big network in Manila. Gives you a network to spread the stuff anywhere you want. The best girls you can go anyway. Do any of them look like you? Are there any other groups like your Plenty. All Good Men. And there's my commander, Marcus. They're the youngest fighters of them all. It'll be great for this one by guns. What? Don't look women from. The point now and I'm not getting on my boots yet Platoon is coming to collect this will live now a lot of of out you hope right. Like I saw one claustrophobia. 000 yeah 00000. I press divert but they right that it astounded me. One thing I see I know what that gold gold popping up and down. I think he's expelled.

Wait in my car. Sees your little limited moments. Yeah, but you know, doggone well, this is different, you know? No, hold on. A woman. I'm just trying to put it in. I can't help looking this way.

All really him. Get on send you. Know? Not really. Like. It Make me feel kind of proud and nice feeling to know that women want you to. They want to protect the man that you love. You best when when boy. But he's so nice to find out. Oh, that's why you girls, you. Ought to see this operation. Cool. Okay, you're getting ready for good. When come about.

Come on, you get me here. I you are in. Charge until we return. The prisoners are to remain in their huts. What's your moment? I got about money, though they don't know is going to money. It'll water for the Americans. I receive urgent message from of Japanese will find them out I think it's true, Kobayashi. And you might have just left to the mainland something. Something blood. Listen, make a fresh trip to the fishing village. Check things out, not go. Oh, oh. Black. Thanks, guys. My friend. Oh, yes. Surely you're back to Filipinos. I everyone restricted to hut anyone living will be shut. Well, the thing to do is for me to make the trip for Kobayashi actually gets back because he got to know what Noro has on his mind. Agreed. Like to go with you. Okay. Okay. The best time. To cook your Christmas budget. All right. I see how this boss, my tie shiny. Glad I thought your mother. She got a little alone. I go scared. Those silver coins were found in several different places. Arrests have been made. Information compile all resulting in a very clear picture of where the silver is coming from. A fishing village on the coast of Bataan, somewhere on the river is mountains. Q China in a cool within sight of your barge? Captain Kobayashi I do not understand, sir. How could it have been? Galia, get silver to village. I'm not certain if it's anything real. What a man. But I intend to find out. I personally interrogate all Americans in Okinawa. The fishing village involved will be raided. Prisoners will be taken. Something wrong, Mr. Elder? No, sir. Good gentlemen. Royalty to the emperor is not simply a military court of ethics, but a matter of pride in country and heritage. I hope we understand each other custom. You must come with us to the Virgin. To come to silver must be something that can't be eliminated. It's going to take a lot of explosives, but they has to start in a cave. And on his side of the camp here, there's enough here to blow up the barracks. So you have enough where he left him that. Oh, no, don't fail. Don't worry. If you get back, then I keep the place. You will be safe. Thank you. All right, we're all set. We blow the barge and the camp with what? Toto has got the stuff. So go get Toto and bring him over here right. You know, I'm. Trying to pull this thing off. Might be during the interrogation. Good idea. Do interrogation for interrogation. Damn you. I'm not going to stand for this. You one thing. The mess up this operation Q you. Inform the Americans of the interrogation. Please advise them to cooperate. I didn't. But come on. Connections of both sides. And those charges laid against the Japanese hot lead into a box. Now, the main cable of the box is your hotline, and you can connect a helmet on any point on that hotline and bomb the camp explosives is what it looks like. Okay. Filipino side. American side. Japanese headquarters Wired charges, terminal box hotline. It's your Yamada. Get the stuff in the cave, please. So, son, but the Japanese intelligence have all the facts. There will be interrogation, Colonel Cushman, very clever man. Also very dangerous advice. Speak truth. There is little time to fully detail, but you must know that to repay you for saving my life has cost me my honor. Yes. Not as a soldier, which I am not, but as a Japanese, which I am. For this. I must pay for. Your basic instinct for self-preservation in one day burst into self-destruction. You mean I'm going to blow up? You put it crudely, but. Well, you give us away. The life of me, dear. I don't know. You. You should take money. Where? Human, I never do nothing. There is no silver. I should worry about Why don't. You knock on the wall? You wait, I'll show you Silver here go. Oh, I say to set. This you in. A long life I've got a complete. Double check the plunger Come on, we have you. And I think I ought to clap for well, both to the hotline. Who's going to connect this? I think the hat fits our lieutenant. Don't take offense, Lieutenant. We are going to play it by ear. Whoever's closest to it. Just remember, the winner takes the chessboard home. Then you say college boy, all Americans and Filipinos. 138. And come on so square. Doesn't know that a man. With this is here. Allow me to introduce myself. For customer care. No intelligence. So, you know. Why I am here. An interrogation will now begin. The other day. I. You're. You're, you're. How did that? I I'm not a man of many words so straight to the point by order of importance. How are you able to transfer all that silver who are involved? What? The contacts among my people gave you assistance Risk Corporation. Also ask Mr. Yamada to join us. In the I don't know, Tokyo. Tokyo. I saw the Americans in solidarity. People have tonight. It is all I've only got. Half a. Day. Who are unsuitable for this tragedy. Or must they have you or killed this? You can't do this to my men. We're prisoners of war entitled to the Geneva Convention. And I'm Democratic. I didn't know. Do I? Democratic? I. It seems Mr. Yamamoto's death confirms my suspicion. Agrees to understand. I must have the truth. If you do not cooperate, I will send again to Fort Santiago. I assure you she will not survive the interrogation. Okay, listen. So take that gear and go that far as fast as you can. But close. You blow that barge fast enough. That might give Clyde and the rest enough time to make a break. Now get moving. I'm Stan. I'm going to take my chances with Clyde. So the barge connection is at the hall. You've got that. Let's get going, boys. Good luck. Come on, hustle your. Why you, man. Somebody's got to help with a plunger. I think. You know about. Your sirens. Oh, had mission of your good. Hey, look. Yes. You don't get them. Do not the girl the girls. Are. Out here. Do not do. Here's the reason, America. What are you. Doing? Foolish. You have no way out of it, you. Action it is not right. It is not to my desire. To kill me Hey, tell you show me coming in That's all it Explosion I had right, commander? What are you able. Please freeze to consider before committing acts of no value we must just talk talk and come to her You. Burn I'm not standing. Living for the future is a much better than dying No, for nothing Who will cry for you in America will cry for you. In a movie I'll. Fight you ever trouble unfamiliar places away from home Surrounded by strangers face they. More. Than you oh saw some time in no life. You must. Use the European. Slang that I can remember We.
