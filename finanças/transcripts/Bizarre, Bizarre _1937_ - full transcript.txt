ACCUSATION AGAINST FELIX CHAPEL AUTHOR OF THE FAMOUS NOVEL THE PERFECT CRIME In the past, man did not know how to read. Or if he knew how, he read the Bible. In any case, he did not live in sin. But today, man can read. And what does he read? What do you read, numerous poor men who came here to listen to me today? You read the wrong books, written with the evil ink of the evil mind. You read loose novels, licentious novels, naughty novels as the French say, or detective stories, which are wretched and vile. However, poor sinners, you are not the most guilty. The authors of these books are the real criminals. And among these criminals, there is one I wish to condemn publicly. I am referring to Félix Chapel, the author of the monstrous and demoniac novel, The perfect crime. He hides in the dark like a criminal after having committed his hideous crimes. His novels sell by the thousand. Yet as strange as it may seem, nobody has met Félix Chapel. Even his publisher has never seen him. Chapel! Félix Chapel! Madame, your nephew, Monsieur Molyneux. That's right, my nephew. What a family! Look at him. The amazingly stupid face of a moron! Dear members of the audience, I am happy to see a relative of mine among you, the famous botanist, Irwin Molyneux. My famous cousin is the author of a remarkable book on the mimicry of mimosa. And his research on carnivorous plants has fascinated the elite of the scientific world. As usual, you are late, dear cousin. Nevertheless, I hope you will say a few words. Forgive me, but unless it is about plants, I am not used to speaking in public. You see, plants... That is, plants and flowers, and more particularly, the mimosa, are as alive as you and I, ladies and gentlemen. Thus, if you mistakenly step on the branch of a mimosa... I did not invite you to talk about mimosa. Tell us about Félix Chapel. What do you think of him? Chapel? Of course, Chapel! Let me speak. I have to talk, otherwise I will choke. Let him speak. I used to be happy. I led a comfortable life, quite comfortable even. I liked my work. I had not chosen it. It was a matter of circumstance or fate. But it was my job. All trades are useful. But one day, I was such a fool. I wanted to read to improve myself. I bought The Perfect Crime by Félix Chapel. I was such a fool. I behaved like the hero of the book. I almost got caught like a beginner. The police have been after me ever since. They are everywhere. Be careful. Get him. Do not shoot. We want him alive. Before you hang me, I will find Chapel and cut open his stomach. What is happening, Madame? I do not know, but it is fun. Quiet please. Why all that noise? What did that young man want? Why did he run away? My Lord, it was William Kramps, the slaughterhouse terror, who Kills Killers and disembowels butchers. William Kramps. And he wants to kill Chapel. - Calm down. - He wants to kill Chapel. What is it to you? Yes, why should I feel concerned after all? I don't know this Chapel, I don't know who he is. Nobody knows who he is. The fresh air feels good. Where is Canada? We forgot Canada. Forgive me, Madame, but your little dog died 5 years ago. You are right. Poor little thing. I am losing my mind. Cousin Bedford talked so long. How tiresome! Bishop Soper speaks so well. He talks for the sake of talking. He is so malicious. And the Molyneux! What a family! They are waiting for me to die to get my money and my houses. Luckily, I am not that old. Of course not. 89 years of age is not old. Fortunately, I have you, Victory. I only care for two people in the world: you and my little Canada. But where is my little Canada? You scared me. You are jumpy, dear cousin. I hope your wife is not ill. On the contrary, Margaret is well. - Did they get the killer? - What do you mean? The assassin, I mean the killer. Unfortunately, I think he got away. You may be pleased to know my wife and children are well. I am saying this, cousin, because you did not ask about them. It is customary to do so among relatives who have good manners and like each other. - Forgive me. - Don't apologise. The main thing is that your wife is well. - I would like to see her. - Nothing is easier. Tell me, Irwin, do you still have in your employ that wonderful person who cooks so well? Yes, Madame Pencil is still with us. Madame Pencil, that's it. Wonderful Madame Pencil who prepares such a delicious duck in orange sauce. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday... Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. And every week it starts over again. How monotonous, Madame Pencil. I would have loved to be a circus rider. These pans shine too much, James. Someday, I will faint, sun-struck on the kitchen floor. If only Billy would come. He could tell us a story. The milkman! The milkman! There he is. Madame Pencil, greetings. Greetings to you too, James. We were so bored. Really? - Are you looking for something? - No. - Someone, maybe? - No. Why? She will come down anyway. She does whenever you are here. - How does she know? - She guesses. Please Billy, finish your story. I do not remember where I stopped. Ideas come and go, you know. You stopped at the last survivor of the Gruyerbeer family. He had taken refuge in a cottage in Openthedoor. Openthedoor, I remember now. The clock struck twelve. It was midnight. I cannot believe it. What a household. Eva! I would appreciate your going to the kitchen to remind Madame Pencil and James that it is customary for servants to come when the lady of the house calls for them. Yes, Madame. Suddenly, a night-bird started to sing. A night-bird in broad daylight, a bleak omen, thought Monsieur Gruyerbeer. Eva! I have to tell you something. Eva, I love you. You already told me. You are an impossible girl. You stare at me while I tell you incredible stories. You even take notes. But if I tell you I love you, you fall asleep. Wake up, Eva. I am here. I love you. - Wake up! - Leave me alone with your love! If you only knew how stupid you look when I tell you I love you. You look like a deaf-mute, a real idiot. If you only saw your face when you say you love me. Bulging eyes wanting to go God knows where. A trembling voice. And that unbearable sentence! I love you, I love you. You love this young man? I cannot believe it. Not at all, Madame, I was saying... I heard what you were saying. Leave now! - Madame! - I told you to leave. - You have no business here. - I brought the milk. Speaking of milk, day and night, we see you in this house with your milk. Milk here, there and everywhere. And desserts and cream. This house is becoming a dairy, a creamery, a barn. May I point out, Madame, that I never charge for it. Send us the bill then and we will pay. Easier said than done. - What did you say? - Nothing. What are you waiting for? Leave! If you insist, Madame. Eva, remember what I told you. I love you. If we are to love each other, you must love me too. Eva, what an unpleasant surprise. Monsieur Molyneux and I have done so much for you. But it is not her fault. Yes it is, Madame Pencil. Improper things happen in this kitchen. I will not allow innuendoes, Madame. I am not upstairs when Madame entertains. Madame Pencil, I rang for half an hour and nobody came. I am so bored, Madame. No distractions, a dull neighbourhood. I want to leave. Madame Pencil, for 6 years now, you have threatened to leave. Do not count on me to hold you back. For 6 years! How stupid of me to stay another minute. I fully agree with Madame Pencil. You cannot go. You are not serious about leaving. We are very serious, Madame. We are very serious, Madame. The milkman! The milkman! Nice weather today. You are right, thank you. You are welcome. But it is not my doing. Are you waiting for someone? Mind your own business! That is the problem. I am interested in other people's business. The milkman! The milkman! Are you going on a trip? - Yes, we are going on a trip. - That's it. Well, have a good trip. A trip? A trip? My dear, it is terrible! If only you knew. They left. They are leaving. They may already be gone. Dragged in mud, worse than that even. The bishop did it in front of everybody! What are you saying? The bishop fell in the mud? Unfortunately no; he dragged me in the mud. It was awful! Chapel, the criminal, the monster, the devil! It is so irrelevant, my dear, since nobody knows Félix Chapel. Nobody knows him but someone is looking for him. And if he finds Félix Chapel, you will be a widow sooner than you think. William Kramps is after me. William Kramps? The killer who disembowels butchers. How awful! When writing awful things, awful things happen in the end. But Margaret, these dreadful novels, unworthy of a gentleman, who made me write them? How else could we live and run this house? Is it thanks to Monsieur Molyneux's plants or Felix Chapel's novels? I do not call this living. A double life is not a life. What are you complaining about? We have kept our social position. We have a nice house, servants that others envy us. Oh, my God, how awful. I had completely forgotten. - What? - Irwin, it is awful. James and Madame Pencil have left. I am not surprised. What do you mean? I met them with their suitcases. Usually, when you see someone with a suitcase, it means they are leaving. It is logical. Don't you understand? Without servants, we are lost. We are separated from the world, like lepers. Yes, like lepers. It is all the more a problem since cousin Bedford is coming for dinner tonight. I beg your pardon? You invited the bishop for dinner? I did not invite him, he invited himself. That's impossible! When writing awful things... 5:25 p.m. Time to check the mimosas. Time for the mimosas! Yes, Margaret. It is time. Please, Irwin, we must do something. He will not believe our servants have left. The bishop will believe we no longer have any. He will tell everybody. What a disgrace! A disgrace! We could cancel perhaps. He is so conceited that he will hate us for it. Maybe a pork chop would do? Are you kidding? He is greedy but fussy. You are right. He wants to eat duck in orange sauce. Duck in orange sauce! It will be a disaster. Well, Eva, how are the mimosas? They are fine. Look how they are swaying. I watered them yesterday with a mixture of gin and whisky. It is extraordinary. These plants live, Margaret. Look at these mimosas. They are completely drunk. They sway like you and I. All is well then. The carnivorous plants seem to be a little tired. Nothing serious. A little anaemia. They need to be fed. These plants, trees and flowers make me sick. I hate flowers. The smallest bouquet of violets makes me sick. One fly, two flies, three flies. They love to eat. Just like cousin Bedford. Please, do not mention the bishop. Let us not mention the bishop. On the contrary. We have a decision to make, my dear. Let us make a decision. Why not after all? - Eva! - Madame? We really are in a bind. I hope you will accept to help us. Madame! Irwin, I have an idea. I am not surprised. You always have excellent ideas. Hold it straight. There is no denying, dear cousin, what a pity that Margaret is not here. Oh, the duck! The wonderful duck in orange sauce! A wing. And a thigh. Where is our dear Margaret exactly? - In the country. - Far away? No, not too far. She is staying with friends. With friends? Friends that we know. Well. How long has this person worked for you? Eva? Well, dear cousin, it has been 15 years now. Really? No, I am mixing her up with the cook. Madame Pencil, yes. Tell me, dear cousin, isn't it strange that your wife chose the day I come for dinner to leave on a trip? She had to leave suddenly because of the measles. It was sudden. Measles? I thought she was visiting friends. That is right. The friends have the measles. Certainly, yes. Excuse me. Where do your friends who have the measles live? Where they live exactly? Dear cousin, are you asking me for their exact address? It is very simple. They live precisely in the Brighton area, I believe. You think so, dear cousin. Strange, strange. - What is the matter? - With what? - Your knife. - Pardon me? You are looking at your knife saying "strange, strange". So I thought... I said "strange, strange”? How odd. Why would I have said "strange, strange"? I assure you, dear cousin, you said "strange, strange”. I said "strange"? How strange! This will never end. The dishes, the cooking, the service. The bishop wants to sleep here. What? That is impossible. Unfortunately! He asked me when you were returning. Not knowing what to say, I said tomorrow morning. He answered: "Very well. I will wait for Margaret and I will leave after lunch". After lunch! It is awful! When writing awful things... Please, Irwin, do something. The bishop has to leave. Did you keep the telegram he sent you? I think so. Fine. I have an idea. I am not surprised. You always have excellent ideas. "TO MY BIG BABY BEDFORD IN MEMORY OF A CRAZY EVENING YOUR LITTLE DAISY" Forgive me, dear cousin, for leaving you alone. A man of the church is never alone. The miseries of the world are always with him. Of course, of course. A telegram, Monsieur. A telegram? May I? It is from Margaret. Yes, a telegram from Margaret. What does she say? "New complications. Impossible to come home for 5 or 6 days. Letter follows." How odd. 5 to 6 days. Poor Margaret. Poor Margaret. - A cigar? - No thank you. Did you lose something? No, on the contrary. That is, I lost my eyeglasses. I think that I... "WILL BE IN LONDON ON TUESDAY. AM COUNTING ON YOUR PRESENCE AT MY CONFERENCE. BISHOP OF BEDFORD" Did you find them? I am like those who look for their hat while they are wearing it. Dear cousin, I usually go to bed early. I would very much appreciate your showing me to my room. But I thought... Since Margaret will only be back in 6 days... I am increasingly anxious to see your wife and I do not have to rush back. So if it is not imposing on you, I will stay with you until Margaret returns. If only you could have seen his face! It was awful. It is your fault. When writing awful things... I refuse to spend my life in this kitchen like a cook. - What can we do? - Hand me the pan. We have to leave the house. When he sees that everybody has left, he will leave. Where will we go, my dear? Anywhere. In a hotel. come on! - To a hotel! - come on. As soon as he leaves, come warn us at the hotel. What if he asks me questions? Tell him I went to see Margaret. That she is very ill with the measles. You will find an excuse. Scotland Yard please, immediately! There is no doubt. A crime was committed. Margaret Molyneux was murdered. - Poor Margaret. - Murdered by her own husband. She was even poisoned by her husband. - Poisoned? - Without a doubt. Your cousin studied exotic plants, oriental plants, poisonous plants. The poison! Do you see this abnormal quantity of milk? Milk is the antidote. Whenever there is poison, there is an antidote and vice versa. For unknown reasons, your cousin poisoned his wife. What a scandal in a respectable family such as ours! Why did Irwin commit such an awful crime? It is impossible. He must have read the wrong books. Maybe. Let the young lady in. To think that such a scandal may tarnish the entire Anglican church. Sit down. I warn you that from now on everything you say can be used against you. How long have you worked for the Molyneux? For 3 years. - Where were you before? - At the Salvation Army. I am an orphan, you see. Why did you leave the Salvation Army, Mademoiselle? Too much music, the same music. It was so sad. Too much music. Why don't you admit, poor thing, that you left the Salvation Army to lead a life of sin. Admit that you also pushed poor cousin Molyneux to sin. Admit that you caused a horrible tragedy. I can only guess what kind of tragedy it was. Poor Margaret discovered your little game and my weak cousin decided to murder the woman who had been his companion during his blameless life. Will you stop it! What if I preached instead of you on Sunday? It seems to me that I am the one investigating. If it is so, do as you please. Pretty woman, pretty legs. "To my big baby, Bedford."” That's great! The milkman! The milkman! Look, the milkman is here. He is early, as usual. And still in love? Why don't you mind your own business? Don't try to change the conversation. I know you are in love with the pretty Madame Molyneux. You can't hide anything from me. I know everything that goes on in the neighbourhood. It is a systematic system then. You systematically refuse to answer. Your questions don't make sense. We will see, Mademoiselle. There are two options: either the body is in the house or it is not. What are you doing here? And what are you doing here? - Detective Bray, Scotland Yard. - The milkman. So you deliver milk? Where is the body? Was somebody murdered by any chance? Murders fascinate me. Don't be a fool. You are an accomplice. It is plain to see! Arrest him. Whatever suits you. How can you laugh, you rascal! Leave Billy alone. He did not do anything. Thank you, Eva. I did not say that to please you. But you said it so nicely. Even with your back to me, I remember your pretty eyes, your pretty mouth. I remember them well. Separate them. They are using a coded language. Leave me alone. Are you going to teach me my job? It seems to me, Detective, that you could have more respect because I lost a relative and because of my dress. Your dress? I may be wearing a bathrobe, but remember that I am the Bishop of Bedford. And I am chief Detective Bray from Scotland Yard. - Oh, Scotland Yard! - Oh, Bedford! - Stop fighting. - Shut up! He is right. How dare you speak to us! I am tired of this. Do you understand? I am leaving. She is running away. She is escaping. Buy the Midday News. An awful murder. A professor poisons his wife. Buy the Midday News. All the details in the Midday News. "AN AWFUL MURDER BRINGS BLOODSHED TO LONDON" "SCIENCE SERVES CRIME" "BLOOD ON THE FLOWERS" "MOLYNEUX NOWHERE TO BE FOUND" "HE MAY BE IN SCOTLAND" "MOLYNEUX SEEN IN PARIS" "A WITNESS SAYS HE MET HIM PLACE DE L'OPERA" How awful! Such a monster. Luckily, he will be hung. Put a rope around his neck. Please, Irwin. I know it is awful. Margaret, this absurd and dangerous situation cannot last. We have to say the truth, to show ourselves. That is impossible. What will people think? What will people think? They think you are dead and I am a murderer. If we say the truth, they will think we are stupid. That is worse. We will be the laughing stock of the city. What an excuse for Aunt MacPhearson who is hoping to disinherit us. Eva has not returned. I am worried. There you are, at last. Eva, did Mr. Thorpson give you any money? He asked me to give you this letter. What is it, my dear? We are struck by misfortune. "Sir, we are unable to give you the advance you requested. However, we have an offer to make. You are certainly aware that the Molyneux murder is fascinating the public. Would you accept to write a few sensational articles for our newspaper? In your perfect style, you could describe your research and conclusions. For each article, we will pay 100 pounds. Should you accept our offer, you will be able to visit and even reside in the murderer's house by showing the enclosed safe-conduct.” 100 pounds! - Are you serious? - Yes. The idea is absurd. I can't... Circumstances require you to do so. There is no other solution. We cannot live without money. The Molyneux case! Latest news! The police on the murderer's trail. The mysterious milkman refuses to talk. You cannot leave Billy in prison. Child, an old family's honour is at stake. Don't you think the milkman can wait a little? No, no and no. If you do not speak up, I will. I will tell the truth if need be. Margaret, I have to tell you something. - What is it? - I have no imagination. Are you losing your mind? What about Chapel's novels? I wrote the novels, but Eva gave me the ideas. What? Monsieur Molyneux is exaggerating. I do not have many ideas. And all those stories? I did not invent them. Billy did. - The milkman? - The milkman! As I said, my dear, you always end up finding, if you look. - How awful! - It is the Chinese quarter. Some idea, this out-of-the-way quarter! But we found it after all. Why hide at the end of the world? It is less likely that we will run into people we know. Do you think we will find a decent hotel? I described this quarter in my last novel, but I have never been here. Eva knew it. - Eva or the milkman. - Or the milkman. Are you looking for something? We want a room. - In the back or on the street? - On the street of course. I suggest in the back. In the street at night, people often kill each other a little. So it gets a little noisy. Madame and Monsieur, will you please follow me? If you do that again, you will die like Molyneux. Like Molyneux! Don't hit me on the head. I will get sick. It is nothing. Over here. Follow me please. - You are staying a few days? - Yes. Forgive me. I thought it was only for a short while. I will be alone a lot. I do not want to be disturbed. Madame, it is quiet here. - What was that? - Nothing. clients. - Are you sure? - Yes. But Margaret... Eva will help you write. She agreed to do so. What if they recognise me? Become unrecognisable. I will go see old Aunt MacPhearson and explain that it is cousin Bedford's fault. Because she hates him... Honestly, Margaret! Irwin, what about your plants? Your beautiful mimosas. Who will take care of them? You are right. My poor mimosas. It is only a matter of patience. We will catch them when they come back. Detective Bray, Scotland Yard. Chapel. My pleasure. We received orders. Consider yourself at home here. At home? Thank you. I am pleased to meet you. Your books are remarkable. How flattering! But I do not always agree with you. You say a criminal always returns to the scene of the crime. I say it is the contrary. I will bet with you Molyneux will not come back here unless he is forced to, of course. Of course. What a mess. And the smoke. They will break the piano, Margaret's piano. Margaret Molyneux's, certainly. But she will never play it again. May (? You are not superstitious? - No. Why? - The murderer's cigars. They all smoke them. They are very good. I don't smoke, but I found other compensations. The whisky is good. Molyneux's delicious whisky. Who is he? Buffington, from the British Morning. A rival of sorts. - Is he sick? - No, he sleeps all the time. Only one noise wakes him. Look. A spring. Buffington, do not go back to sleep. Somebody would like to meet you. - Félix Chapel, the author. - Félix Chapel? Pleased to meet you. I often wanted to read your novels, but I never read, sorry. Why did you wake me, Detective? I was about to discover the body. To each his own method. I work while I sleep. I solve the world's problems in my dreams. I go to sleep and the enigma disappears. How unusual. I am looking for Madame's body. I saw it in my dream. It is near a spring. A spring... He will not bother you much. You can write your article in peace. My article? Oh, yes. Detective, the young man who was arrested... The milkman? Could I ask him a few questions? We don't have much against him. But we need to find the maid. I will give you a pass. Then I can send my secretary. 5:25 p.m. Time to check the mimosas. - I beg your pardon? - The mimosas... May I go into the garden? I will show you the way. Do not bother. My mimosas. My mimosas, my darling little mimosas. - What are you doing? - We are digging. But you are destroying my mimosas. So what. We are searching for the body. - But the body is not there. - How do you know? You are right, I do not know. Here I am, my little ones. One fly, two flies... In the little house where everything seems so quiet the horrible Molyneux with his hateful eyes stares at his poor companion. In the broth cup he pours the poison. Listen. Listen. Listen, your honor. We want the head of the coward poisoner. Follow me, Mademoiselle. He is very handsome. You have good taste. Congratulations. If I were a young lady... You have a visitor. Eva! You here? I have to talk to you. Talk to me? If you came to say you love me, I will listen to you. I need you, Billy. You have to find ideas for me. Ideas? What a funny idea! Yes, ideas. What do you think of the Molyneux story? Nothing at all. It does not interest me. Please, Billy. Be reasonable. I must go. They want to arrest me. I am hiding in the attic at the Molyneux's. You think it is fun? They are looking for you? You are crazy to have come! Are you annoyed? That you are crazy? Not at all. I would like for you to be crazy about me. If you were crazy about me, I would not cure you, but take care of you. I would put you in a straight jacket very slowly, like this... Leave me alone, Billy. You know, I am quite liberal. If you want to kiss, it is just a matter of money. For 3 shillings, I will look the other way and stay in my corner over there. Eva, give him the money. I don't have any. - I don't want to. - Give it to him. Can't you see what a poor fellow he is? Mademoiselle, I have a wife, an old mother and three children. Poor man! You are good-hearted, Eva. That is good. The sun in a bottle. Exuberance in a flask. I should not drink. I am in mourning. A loved one, I suppose. No, but I don't have a family. So when an interesting person is murdered, I am in mourning for a while. It is distracting. I feel less lonely. It is sad to be alone. Do you want us to comfort you? Why not my little ones! Strange distraction. You get your pleasure where you can. Detective! Are you leaving? Yes. I am convinced we will not find anything. We will look elsewhere. Eva! The milkman! The milkman! The milkman! What? Milk? I hate milk. - Billy? - Where are you? Up here. come up. Good night. Why did you yell? Who me? I yelled? I did not yell. I was having a stupid dream. A milkman selling whisky. They let you go just like that? Yes. Then they followed me to see where I was going. But I know London better than they do. I lost them and here I am. Here I am. We live in a cute place. What do you mean? You cannot stay here. Why not? Because... I don't know. You see, you don't even know. Where should I go then? - I don't know. - You don't know anything. You talk for the sake of talking. For you some things are allowed, others are not. For example, I kissed you the other day. I heard it is not allowed, but since we did it, it is allowed. And why can't we repeat the things we did, since we enjoyed them? Since you enjoyed them? Billy! I have to work. Since you are here, help me by giving me some ideas. Again! I would like to write a few nasty things on the bishop. Whatever you want, darling. We could even get him into trouble. - Not too much trouble. - No, just a little. Go ahead and write! "WILL IRWIN MOLYNEUX KILL BISHOP SOPER? IT IS VERY LIKELY BY FELIX CHAPEL" It is awful, Archibald. Just awful! I know, Elisabeth. We can no longer breathe here. This threat that hangs over us. I am worried about the children. Luckily, they are well watched over. Children, it is time to go. Students who are late at school are bad students. All these policemen. How unpleasant! We have no privacy. You are right, Elisabeth. It is very unpleasant. Nothing to report. There is one thing. We want this surveillance to stop as soon as possible. I am sorry. You are under my responsibility, My Lord. And you too, Madame. And all your children as well. I am here. I keep watch and await events. Let's go! Are you hiding something from me? I am worried, that is true. All the publicity regarding this case. And Félix Chapel who is in the house, rummaging and searching. What of it? Nothing. Archibald, look at me. When you look at me like that, honestly, you are hiding something. Archibald, take the baby. I am going to drop him. What happened? In Molyneux's house, Chapel may find a book I forgot there and put it to bad use. What book? It is a brochure, in fact. A music-hall program. How shameful! What is there in this program? There is an autograph. My name is written on a photograph. That of a woman, a loose woman. Rascal, give me my baby. - Do not touch him anymore! - Elisabeth! Archibald, you must find the program. It is not easy. The house is watched. - They could recognise me. - Find a solution! The reputation of our family must remain above suspicion. I will do anything. I promise. Some day you may even forgive me, Elisabeth. The future belongs to the One in Heaven who judges you. If only I could see the bishop's face. What a scandal! Poor Margaret! But I am not going to pity Margaret. I hated her and she hated me too. But it is an awful tragedy. Awful, as you say. But I was quite lucky. Molyneux could have killed me too. Do not say that, Madame. You scare me. He could show up and try to cut my throat. And cut yours too. And cut Canada's throat. Where is my little Canada? - Who is it? - I do not know. Well, go see! I will try to go see who it is. Open up! Open the door! Who is it? I must talk to Madame MacPhearson. Who is it? I cannot say. I have a revelation to make. A ghost! Madame, a ghost! It is awful! Open up! Open up! It is Margaret, Margaret Molyneux. The ghost of Madame Molyneux. I saw it with my own eyes. All pale, covered with blood. It wore a large sheet. The white of the eye was all white. A ghost. Canada? Where is Canada? Shut the window. The ghost will grab Canada. Eat your soup, Charlie. But I'm not hungry. If you don't eat it, Molyneux will come and take you away. Good evening. I told you she would return. She is beautiful. I have never seen such a beautiful woman. Have you known many? No. I am too busy. I do not have the time. In fact, women make me uneasy. They intimidate me. Whereas this woman! I love her. - Get me some flowers. - Now? - Get me some flowers. - I am off. Are you crying? What are you doing here? What can I do to stop your tears? Who are you? I have never seen such beautiful red hair. You must be joking. I rarely joke. You are very attractive. Please, leave! You did not knock. It is not polite. Would you have opened? What do you want? I don't know. Many things probably. Stay away or else I'll scream. I will leave and you can call me. Call for William, that is my name. And I will come back. For our sake, I hope you are a gentleman. Madame... I will allow you to stay for a moment. I feel so alone, so let down. - I would love to... - Stay away. Forgive me, but it is the first time that I am alone in a room at night with a young man who is not my husband. - You are married? - Yes. Happily? You do not marry to be happy. You must lead a mysterious life, a painful life. If only you knew. I cannot tell you this awful secret. Do not worry. I will not ask. May I call you Daisy? I beg your pardon? I always dreamt of loving a Daisy. I have always dreamt of love. - Oh, love! - Yes, love. Love! Love... Love, Daisy. Love. Love. That is enough. Love, Daisy. Love. Love. - Do you like flowers, Daisy? - I love flowers. You are such a child. A newspaper! You read the newspapers? What is the matter? A woman like you should not read the newspapers. It is not fitting. All those murders and tales of criminals. Life is beautiful. It must stay so. Promise you will not read them. I promise, my dear. "FELIX CHAPEL ON THE SCENE OF THE CRIME - Well, well! - What is the matter? Nothing. I need some fresh air. In fact, I have to leave. It is midnight. Midnight, the murder hour. - You are leaving? - I have something to do. Must you leave? Swear that you are not meeting another woman. I swear. - What an awful night. - Are you sick? No, I'm an insomniac. No, please. Don't. Do you know another trick? Another trick? When I was a child, they sang to me... What was that song? Yes. "Little pigeons”. Wait a minute. "Little pigeons”. What a piano. Sleep, sleep, little pigeons. Sleep, sleep, little pigeons. Tomorrow the bells of London, Ding, dong, ding, dong, The bells of London will wake you. Sleep, sleep, little pigeons. Thank you very much. - Are you leaving? - Yes. I am going to walk in the wind and sing to fall asleep. Sleep, sleep, little pigeons... He is leaving me alone. Eva, Eva? Please, Eva! I am all alone and a little afraid. Eva. Eva. Billy. Alright. Chapel, Félix Chapel. William Kramps. I have wanted to meet you for so long, Chapel. Félix Chapel. Listen. This is an awful misunderstanding. Life is so strange. Some people I see only once. I look at them, they are alive. And when I leave, they are dead. Listen. It is impossible. Let me talk. Are you in such a hurry to say your last words? Drink. The last drink of the condemned. Come on, drink. But do it quickly. My time is precious, and yours is counted. Are you going to cut my throat like that? What is worse? To kill or be killed? Who knows? - You wrote it. - Yes but... I read your books. They almost hung me because of you. You are a public enemy. A poisoner. Do you understand? I may be a poisoner, but not the poisoner you think I am. - What? - Let me speak, please. I am not Félix Chapel. I am Irwin Molyneux. The one everybody is looking for. Look. I cannot believe it. It may be unbelievable, but it is true. And what about Félix Chapel? I poisoned him. Poisoned? Why? To pass the time. I did not like his books. And I had started to poison my wife. One thing led to another. That is unbelievable. You really are a master. I drink to you. How kind of you. - You will not drink alone. - I do not know what to say. It feels good. I do not drink often, but when I do... When you drink, you drink. May I put my beard back on should someone come? If someone comes, the two of us will not let him go. Of course! And your wife? Can you explain why... An impossible woman. No tenderness. She only loved money. She liked to spend, entertain and appear in public. So I made her disappear. I wanted someone to love me. I understand you, my friend. You never found someone to comfort you? I found a young lady but she laughed at me. She loves a milkman. What a pity! Why? Had she loved a butcher, I could have helped you. But a milkman! I understand. Butchers are your speciality. You must understand. I do not mind killing butchers because I am a rather sensitive person. I would never harm a fly. I love animals with a passion. Whereas butchers, they kill animals. So I kill butchers, do you understand? Yes, I understand. And I take the butchers' money. Since they kill animals, and since I love animals, I have no regrets, you see. All I need is a little money, killing a butcher once in a while, having a little sun and a little love. Love! Forgive me, my friend, but I love a wonderful creature. I should not talk about it. On the contrary. When my friends are happy, so am I, What is she like? She is wonderful. Her name is Daisy. Daisy. What a pretty name. She is a real goddess. If only you had seen her this morning with a flower in her golden hair. My wife was a redhead. She hated flowers. I want you to meet her. You must absolutely meet her. Of course, yes, yes. Sleep, sleep, little sheep. Here we are. I have the feeling I have already seen this hotel. In the Chinese quarter, all hotels look alike. That is true. My little sheep... Irwin! The stairs are steep. Wait here for me. I will come and get you. The little pigeon. Come in. It is you, my dear! You were not expecting me? Run, William. My husband is here. - Your husband? - I saw him in the hotel. For the love of God, leave. I do not love God, I love you. William, you scare me. You will ruin my reputation. If you are a gentleman, leave. I am a gentleman, Daisy. Where is my bicycle? - So? - Her husband is here. Really, her husband is here? How strange. I really wanted you to meet her. Another time maybe. We cannot stay here. - Where do you want to go? - To my house. I will show you my mimosas. Your mimosas! Very pretty mimosas and strange flowers. You will see. I don't want to drink anymore. I will get drunk. Your head turns one way, the earth the other. You fall in between. But a real gentleman walks straight and saves his dignity. A pool! What are you doing? What are you doing, William? What are you doing, William? I am going to take a bath. What are you doing? The little flowers! William! My friend, my brother. You are going to drown. No, I will die at the end of a rope. William, you are going to catch a cold. I will get you a bathrobe. A little bathrobe for my good friend William so he does not catch a cold. The murderer! The one and only! Who is it? I don't know, but I am sure it is he. In fact, I saw him in my dream. Look. Are you sure? Will you accept the responsibility? Yes. Fine then! Connect me to Scotland Yard immediately. Death to Soper! I assure you that I know things that nobody else knows. But what about Molyneux? Molyneux is only a pitiful accomplice. Soper's arm is the instrument that poured the poison. It is the bishop and I can prove it. I accuse you formally, Monsieur Soper. Detective Bray, I accuse you of causing this scandal. Trouble comes to those who cause a scandal. Detective, do not forget who I am. Should you not respect the man I am, at least respect my dress. Can you explain why you are wearing such a dress? And why you are searching the murderer's house at night? - I told you. I forgot something. - What? I cannot tell you. A family's honour is at stake. Let me go through! Look at me, I am alive! It is me, Madame Molyneux! - She is crazy. - She is drunk. - I am Margaret Molyneux. - I am the Bishop of Bedford! And I am Admiral Nelson. I assure you, I am Margaret Molyneux. Madame, don't make fun of such things. How disgraceful indeed. If you are drunk, stay home. Daisy, what are you doing here? - I should ask you that question. - Why? This is my home. This house is mine. Should they find you here, like that, what will they think of me? The world is so malicious. If I understand you correctly, you are... I am Margaret Molyneux. After all, what does it matter to me? You are the one I love. That is all that counts. Never mention it again. Let bygones be bygones. It was only yesterday, Daisy. Stop calling me Daisy. Such a vulgar name. But you said you loved me. I must have been weak. I do not want to hurt you, my dear, but your social status is so different from mine. I do not know who you are. I have nothing to hide. I am William Kramps, the one who kills butchers. Daisy, wake up. Come back to me, Daisy. She is not as pretty as I thought. Come on, Buffington. Wake up! Buffington, they want to kill the bishop. You said you would take on the responsibility. Buffington! Margaret! What are you doing here? Irwin, I cannot stand it any longer. We must tell the truth. Not so loud. The police are upstairs. They cannot arrest the bishop. He is innocent. Innocent? This is all his fault! Victory, I believe I lost Canada. Aunt MacPhearson. Margaret, you must hide. - But where? - Here. If she sees you, we lose the inheritance. Stay here. Do not move. Monsieur Chapel, I presume? Yes, Madame. Forgive me for keeping my hat on. I have a cold. Your portrait was in the newspaper. I recognise you. - A beautiful beard. - Yes, Madame. Truly beautiful. I am flattered. I am Annabel MacPhearson, Molyneux's aunt. Forgive me, Madame, you are sitting on someone. Really? I am sorry. Monsieur Chapel, please give me a pen and a piece of paper. I want to draw up my will. - But Madame... - Do as I say. My relatives are disgusting. Right, Victory? Absolutely, Madame. I want to disinherit them. As they are more or less killing each other, why wait? I have decided you will be my sole heir, Monsieur Chapel. Madame, how kind of you. I owe it to you. You uncovered my cousin, the bishop. Will they kill him? - Who? - The bishop. The bishop? I do not think so. But what does it matter. You only die once. When a bishop dies he must go straight to heaven. Where will I go when I die, Billy? You? You will go to hell with me. Why? Billy! May he who has never sinned cast the first stone at us. I am sure he did it! Are you crazy? What are you doing? I always return a thrown stone. - You will draw attention. - That's right. So I will go pull his ears. I can't help it. When hurt, I have to pull someone's ears. - You are going out? - Yes. - No! - That is what we will see. You will face the two journalists who saw you during the night. I warn you. I will not say another word. - But you said nothing. - I will continue to do so. Please stay. I must pull somebody's ears. Have it your way then! Well, well, well! We let you go and here you are at the scene of the crime. You are delivering milk no doubt. No, it is my day off. I am taking a stroll. You are taking a stroll. How strange. Look at your accomplice, Monsieur Soper. I have nothing to do with that rascal. The Scottish are not polite this year. It is not important. On the contrary. In fact, you are a godsend. I was looking for somebody. Yes, I was looking for somebody. And I happen to find a Scotsman, an ill-mannered Scotsman. A Scotsman with ears. - Stay away from me. - Such beautiful ears. A right ear and a left ear. Everything is in the right place. Wonderful! May 1? My ears! He dared touch one of my ears. Detective Bray, I warn you. You must protect my head, my ears and my body. Billy! “I am in full possession of my faculties. Drawn up in London by Annabel MacPhearson." There! Read it. There you are. Aren't you ashamed? After preaching to us for years, you end up being a murderer. Annabel, due to your old age, I will not remember your irreverent words. My old age? Arrogant fellow. Hide your knees, traitor and murderer. - Annabel! - My old age! I will go to court and testify that you poisoned Canada. You poisoned her, you wicked hypocrite. Who are you referring to, Madame? Your relative poisoned someone else? - Canada! - Canada? Yes, a poor animal who never harmed anyone. You will agree that she has lost her mind. Excuse me, but this lady possesses all her faculties. - Who are you? - Félix Chapel. You should be ashamed of who you are. Please be more polite. Do not exaggerate. Can you prove that your cousin did anything? I am convinced he did. Irwin Molyneux killed Margaret as sure as your name is Chapel and I am the Bishop of Bedford. Ding, dong, ding, dong... I know where the body is. Poor Margaret Molyneux's body. It is here. The ghost! Go away, shadow of Margaret! You no longer belong among the living. Please go! We will pray for you but please disappear. But she is alive! Is this a dream? What a brute! Vulgar individual! No, it is not a dream. I cannot stand it any longer. Do you believe it is the real Margaret Molyneux? I am not really sure. Yes, it is she. I recognise her. Unbelievable! You wait for events and they finally happen. - Leave me alone! - As you wish. Madame, can you explain? Forgive me, but I am so tired. Pull yourself together, Madame. Above all, she needs some rest. Do not question her for now. Detective Bray, sooner or later, divine justice prevails. You vilely accused me. And the so-called victim is as alive as you and I. You will pay for it. I cannot believe it. Who told us Madame Molyneux had been killed? None other than you, Monsieur Soper. Detective, they are wild! They want the bishop. Someone has a rope. They want to hang him. To hang me? That is impossible. Tell them I have good news for them. - Yes, but... - Go! Listen, everybody! I have incredible news for you. Madame Molyneux is not dead. She is alive and I will show her to you. She is alive! There is no crime then! And no murderer. I suppose we should go then. She is alive. What does it prove? It proves the bishop did not kill her. But he remains a debauched scoundrel! I have the proof right here. Look at this. "For my big baby, Bedford." Let us go! And where is Molyneux? It would be difficult to show him. He is dead. The big baby Bedford killed him. And Madame Molyneux is his accomplice. Hello, Scotland Yard? Hello? Scotland Yard, please answer. There is no answer. Please stay calm. May 1? Hello? Scotland Yard? They are going to break down the door. Do not worry. Hello? Scotland Yard? I broke it. I have a few things to say. I will tell it like it is. I am the only one who is allowed to speak here. William Kramps! Stay away from me. Let me speak. I killed Irwin Molyneux. It was dark outside. He walked past a butcher shop. It was a terrible mistake. I killed the wrong person. But what is done is done. I warn you. Do not search for the body. I threw it in the Thames. In the Thames! With a rock attached to his neck. My poor Irwin. How awful! Do not cry too loud, Margaret. When a husband dies, it is fitting for the wife to cry. My poor Irwin! I am not completely dead. Irwin, seriously, you must understand. If Molyneux reappears, the inheritance disappears. It is best that Molyneux disappear forever. My poor Irwin, how awful! Yes, it is awful. I will have to keep this beard for the rest of my life. Better be rich with a beard than penniless without one. My poor Irwin, how awful! Poor Irwin! The Lord gave him to us and took him back. His will be done. Let me through! Madame, consider me as a member of the family. Thank you. On behalf of the neighbourhood, accept our condolences. He was such a wonderful man. He was so generous and not haughty at all. He was an honest man. He could walk with his head held high. Nobody owed him anything. He was always so happy. William Kramps! I am so surprised. Anything is possible, Detective. - May I? - What? Let him ask her for forgiveness. Daisy, I wanted to do something for you. I did my best. Start a new life with Félix Chapel. Molyneux was stupid. Félix Chapel certainly is an idiot, but it will be a little different. - They will hang you. - I doubt it. I escape each time. My poor Irwin, how awful! That is enough. Let us go. I am all yours, Detective. - Adieu Madame! - Adieu! I am sure he poisoned Canada. Hang William Kramps! - Wonderful! - How is that? The devotion of William Kramps. He did that for me and I hardly knew him. You knew him? Just a little. You have strange acquaintances. - THE END -
