I'm Rebecca Carpenter, and here's the latest on the situation devastating our community. According to reports, people have been attacked by individuals infected with some form of rash and skin discoloration on their faces and bodies. Those infected appear to be attacking anyone within sight. Police Chief Sarah Booth urges citizens to comply with his stay-at-home order. Until further notice, streets are to remain closed. Anyone found outside of their homes during this mandatory stay-at-home order will be subject to arrest. This has been signed into effect by Mayor Robert Miles and will be in effect until further notice. More than 50 people are confirmed dead this morning following an outbreak at a senior assisted living facility. The virus swept quickly through the facility infecting seniors who have been reacting violently. Multiple staff members are among the dead. We still do not know an origin, nor do we know why this virus appears to be attacking the elderly. We'll be back in the second we receive more information on this tragedy sweeping the nation. (ominous music) (zombie gurgling) (ominous music continues) - They're scared. (zombie gurgling) - [Mike Voiceover] I really need to tell Fred that I fucked his sister, man. - Your weed makes us the new gods of the post-apocalyptic world because of our enlightened heads. - [Mike Voiceover] I really need to piss, man. (zombie gurgling) - What we have to do as enlightened beings is figure out how to stop these things and being the special features fanatic that I am, I know the number one way to stop these things is just shoot 'em in the head or stab 'em in the head. - [Mike Voiceover] How come I can't talk loud? (zombie gurgling) (tense music) - Hello? I'm here to pick up my grandma. (zombie gurgling) (Julie gasps) - Fuck yeah, man. Let's do this. (tense music) (box rattling) (tense music continues) (helicopter rumbling) (heart beating) (zombie gurgling) - [Victim] Ah, help me! (heart beating) - Anyway, um, let me know what time I should come tonight. I've been trying to get hold of you and Chad the whole day. None of you pick up the phone, so just let me know what time I should come, okay? (zombie gurgling) (heart beating) (helicopter humming) (heart beating) (phone ringing) Hey, girl. No, I, I just called Fred and left him a message. I, I can't hear you. I'll call you back when I get home, okay? (heart beating) (zombie growling) What the fuck is that? (zombie growling) Nice makeup, bro. Didn't know it was Halloween in July. Oh, you fuckin'! (intense music) (flesh squelching) - [Radio Reporter] This is truly devastating how we're being lied to again and not told the truth. People don't just randomly attack one another for no apparent reason. There's something else happening here. If you have any information at all, please call information. I will be here all day and all night with you guys. Anyone who's out there listening, I'm here with you. (sirens wailing) (determined music) - I have a sword. (determined music continues) Ooh.
