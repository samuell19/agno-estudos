Go! Faster! I do not know what boys find him at this Alexa. She has an easy genre, that's all. We can do the same, if we want. Why did we stop? Official Cortege. Another negro king? No They are whites. That's it! This is Noel Carradine, my childhood friend. Yeah... And the general, that's my little brother. Good. Albert will buy Coca-Cola, you, the sandwiches, and you, the records. - OK. - Yeah! - We play soccer? - No after. You are great, Alexa. No Organized. It's my turn, to accompany you at 4 pm. I've mopped my brother's convertible. Then, that changes. So? Always alone ? - Watch out, miss Alexa! - It's okay ! You're great, Alexa, having invented the math lesson. We gain 2 hours of freedom. Without seeing the old, it rests. A ham-butter. - There is mail for me? - Yes. "Miss Alexa Rollo. " At the good care of Michel, barman of the snack Joseph, "7, Rio de Janeiro Square." Thank you, it does me a favor. Always the same writing, the same smell of tobacco. C is solid. Worse. This is serious. And incognito! Well! I have to pay my remaining postage tax. Yes. Here. You have some, nerve! If you think we're going to bother you while watching TV. Since you have bought this job, the house is badly kept. I never see you again. And we do not see you anymore, at the same time! Potato! Cheri. My little Edith. What clutter! If it continues, I will not be able to come back to lunch. It would only be missing! What news with your toy dealer? - He is interested in my automatons. - This is good. "Momentane", it's been 8 days. 5 floors, it's nothing. That makes me hungry. And the shop, how are you? The new knits are a success, and as I am in percentage. - Ant, go! - Cicada, go! - Tonight, I'll go get you. - It will please me. It seems that you've done a showcase of a chic. - What a woman I have! - Do you feel anything? Oh yes! It feels the burn. Berthe. My dear Berthe, what's happening to you? I made a pie, but time to iron some clothes... It will be more crisp. For the last 10 years that you've missed your pies, we've got used to it. Instead of thinking, Mister would do better to repair the vacuum that is out of order. I am not a handyman, I am an inventor. Oh yes, it's true! C & you are the ones who have invented the potato. That makes you laugh when the staff mocks me? Berthe has become a friend. I'm not a friend, everyone hates me. I know what is said about me, and the ridiculous nickname that is thrown in my face. - Edith. - Yes ? Do you think I have a nose like a vegetable? But no! In addition, on your identity card, they put "ordinary nose". They do not try to be kind, to the police prefecture. So! Maybe a little overweight. In high school, I was thin. This is what we call "Potato". And who has baptized "Potato"? That big bastard of Christmas Carradine. Mr. Noel Carradine, the well-known financier, received the European medal of the industry. My dear! You have already returned. I did not expect until tomorrow. Without you, I was bored. These 15 days on the mountain were fatal. Were you wise? Ah! The proof. Do you think I laughed in Paris, with our board of directors? You only had to let them and join me. Oh yes, yes! Just when you had to buy shares. Who have double. Therefore, I do not occupy so much of my fortune. We are rich enough. But you are happy too. Very happy! See, I have 2 husbands. What a pity that you can not duplicate yourself. You would be more often with me. Oh, Veronique! I'm going to show you, ladies, how to cut a roti with my pedal cutter. Bravo, my dear. This is a wonder. Oh, the, the! But stop! Stop, Mr. Leon. There is one for a regiment. We are only 3. How? Alexa does not eat so not at home? Our daughter takes her lesson of mathematics. If she wants to have her baccalaureate before 45 years... Are you leaving at 4:00 pm in Bernard's car? Yes. It's his turn. When will it be my turn? - When you will be motorized. - This is not tomorrow the day before. My parents do not even want to buy a scooter. Poor kid, go! Well, you're too cute. One day, we will take the bus together. - Yes? When? - Oh, that! - Alexa! - Yes. The great elan towards the heat and the sun therefore pushes these various echassiers to make annual migrations as spring warms the sky. In the abdominal cavity, the ventricle succenturia... To this one succeeds the manager: Stomach crusher. So that these nice little beasts fly from the crest up to the tail and conclude that this is the inevitable spring. - What is it? - This is the inevitable spring. Miss Rollo! You are the devergondee of the class. When your father, who is a comrade of war, will come to ask me news of your studies, I will share with you your little school success, but of your male triumphs. Oh, flattering! Above, there was the war. All my youth on the floor. Returning to civilian life, was the realm of the combines. A rotten republic. That's it, another tile. I feel them coming. The habit. - Mr. Rollo? - That's me. A tire. Here. - That's not true, I dream? - What? - 5 floors! - So what ? Oh, name name! Ah! Name of name! - What? - This is the big day. Michalon gives me an appointment. "Michalon patents are waiting for you at 5 pm." What are you going to try to sell to him? I will offer everything, everything. I'll offer the underwater binocular, the magnetic letter scale, the weaver duck, the calendar toothbrush. The time to check the mechanics. Hurry up. I go to work. Tonight, dear, it's the fiesta. Ole! I will introduce you to Mr. Michalon. Goodbye. That's it, we've arrived. Terrible! All that remains is to pay me the price of the race. D & agree. Here! So, you cheat. Hush! Here is my dad. A taxi. You have not seen a taxi? We have a car. - Hi, daddy! - I am late. I have an appointment at 5 pm with Michalon. - Michalon? Licences ? - Yes. - Terrible! - Yes. But the place of Victories, is not next. We took you there. OK, Bernard? - OK. If it pleases you. - Go! Monte, dad. How are you? - Here it is. - I'm confused. I will pay you your essence. Do not worry. The price of the race, it looks at me. How are you, dad? - We've arrived. - Good luck. I had to take your mother to the store. Go there and come home without me. My box! By the way, thank you, young man. Good luck, Mr. Rollo. You will make a detour. Direction Faubourg-Saint-Honore. Ca, it increases the price of the race. You will make me a lump, my old man. How so! No! No! Something else! Yes. Corner-corner! "Coin-corner"? Corner-corner. Outside! - Outside! Yes, Mr. Michalon. - Faster than ca. - Yes sir. Outside! Potato! What is happening? - If you pack your things... - It's okay. - Do you learn your lessons? - Yes. This is nice, that's my little bunny. Maxime... Maxime. Lulu, what are you doing here? My old people are in the kitchen, I'm embarrassed. Oh, misery! Well, it's for you. Owl! Thank you very much, Mr. Patate. - So, my dear? - Did it work, dad? Good news, Mr. Leon? Well, Michalon was enthusiastic. But it puts me in impossible conditions, so I've been dealing with rogue and I left slamming the door. Here is ! Bravo! You're a tough guy. You did well. Since the time that he is doing us the blow. Keep your patents for a great occasion. Thank God, we do not wait after that to eat. A day will come. That day, they will have to remove the bastards from the front! Ca, you're right. I'll give you a hand. - Say, do you like my new dress? - What new dress? Excuse me. I do not know how to see these things. Oh, beautiful! T are a true Parisian. Soon, I will cover you with gold. You will not work anymore. No question! I am not a marie-pot-au-feu. We eat? I have one of those cravings, me. First service! Send! She can not speak, she screams. This is your daughter. Faster, slave! I know what you need invent and urgently. - Oh yes! What ? - Something to silence Alexa. Alexa! Alexa! Is it you who make this noise? Are you coming? We have 4 places for the Sports Palace. I am not allowed to go out. My old ones are a bit... What are they, "your old ones"? See you tomorrow. They must be pretty, the parents of those kids who go out at night. - Did you do your homework? - Yes. Because Mr. Bichard does not make you a winner for the bac. - Oh good! He told you? - Yes. He told me. When I think that I saved her life during the war. - Figure yourself one morning... - Oh no, beard! - You liberated France in 1945. - But she does not care about her father. - Do you like me? - Yes, I like you. So we like it. - Yes, but I'm sleepy. - That's it. Do not fall in the tender. Here! Goodbye, Mrs. Edith. Goodbye, Mr. Leon. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. And you work. Keeping the account of the shop, I am instructed. If one day we have a shop. You are the only reasonable person in this house. So let's talk about it reasonably, you want. "Reasonably?" You do not have to go door to door to offer your patents. - You deserve better than that. - Very much of your opinion. Since you often work with your friend Marcel, the car mechanic, why do not you install a workshop to exploit yourself commercially ideas on a practical scale? You are beautiful. And the capital? Capital is needed - A lot? - Oh ! Do I have the head of a gentleman who has loaned millions? But what do you think? Well, I think, maybe, you could ask for help... To whom? - Well, a... - What? To him? M humble in front of my worst enemy. That's all you got? I like to die better. He is a great businessman. I have to call now? It's like a tooth that hurts. It must be quickly removed. I already think I hear it. "But that's my good big old potato!" Oh, no! This is too hard. Leon, do it. For me. Always play bridge with pretty women. When we lose, it consoles you. And when we win, she serves you. We ask Mr. on the phone. This phone! What a horn, ladies. Another case. Maybe, you never know. I am tireless. A matter of heart? Maybe. Do we ever know. You are tireless. I'm dead, forgive me. The time to call and I resurrect. I had to say that I was not there. Who is it ? This is the guy who always screams. The boy's childhood friend. - Who? - Mr Rollo. - Oh! Potato. - As Mr Called. A long time ago. If a day catches rabies, I know who to bite first. Hello? This is Leon. But that's my good big old potato. I thought you were dead. I am alive. This was a false joy. How's the pretty Edith? Very good. And she is more and more pretty. Thank you. What a mess! Oh, cow! What? Well, I say... I say... How is Veronique? Wonderfully good. She went to the mountain for 15 days. She came back from a delicious mood. Forcing. 2 weeks without seeing you, what a rest! Toc. And your idiotic inventions, how are you? As you used to go. They would need to marry a bank account. Re toc! Yes, finally. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Ah! You're kidding ? I adore. I love when you joke. Give me an appointment, we would joke more quietly. What? Next week. Wednesday? 11 am? Agreement. Hello ! In the pocket. What do you think? I think that it will be necessary for me to accompany you. I was looking for you. I was already bored. How nice to tell me. Oh! Good evening, Mr. Chairman. Madam, sir. Have you received a call? From whom? Oh! I forgot my bridge partners. I was doing the dead. Make you do the dead, to you? They are crazy. You who are so alive. - Finally! - I see that I was bored with me. Look, dear. My last find. When you arrive at a number, you take a card. Then you make out the number by turning ca. If it holds. This is a kind of game of goose, better. This is beautiful. Where are you going to look for all these ideas? Your game is worth 1 billion. "1 billion!" You are more far-fetched than me. Do you hear, Leon? Our song. Do you remember ? We drank without fear And without remorse The wine of youth The devil in the body, the devil in the heart And in the same agreement Our joys, our crying Have joined the infinite sweetness D & A wonderful spring A spring that had put us The devil in the heart The devil with the body Etons of a brand new happiness On an air in minor that effortlessly Picking for a rebirth a beautiful day This song of our loves Who will come without saying then tell us What if the devil to the body a day is dying We will keep still The devil in the heart Do you know what this air reminds me? I was 19 years old, I was alone, I had the blues. One evening, I heard this song, and 3 min after, I met. What a tile! Maxime. But she m'rangle, this shirt. You can not put a colored shirt. We make stories, for this Carradine. But, Leon, does not gesticulate like that. Provided that Marcel has ruled the plateau. It's been 3 days that he should have done that. This is the big day. Do we dress up as penguins? What? I'm going to humiliate myself in front of my intimate enemy and here is everything you find to encourage me. Have not you left for college yet? I'm going there. Goodbye. And glory to the martyr! I have prepared an omelette. I'm crazy about your omelette. It becomes unbearable here. Really that Monsieur is famous. Youpi! We saw a sensa thing, at the Sports Palace. - You should have come, listen. - I'm serious, me. - I do not go out at night, me. - The Blessed Virgin, what. Marcel! - Marcel! - This is for you, boss. - Yeah! Minute! - So ? Ah! Hello, Mr. Rollo! What are you crazy about, instead of taking care of our business? Scrap metal, that's my livelihood. Your inventions, it is my violin of Ingres. You, instead of laughing, in the hole, lazy! - Will it hold, the welds? - Guaranteed! Marcel, if all goes well, tonight, I'm another man. - And I'll settle for my slate. - Since the time ! I promised you 10% on the profits. This is huge. This is huge when there are profits. The briefcase is great. She has me 15 tickets. It makes a beef effect, sir. You are champion. It's a pleasure, Marcel, to have a collaborator like you, who appreciates beautiful things and who supports artists. A Potato, Potato and a half. Leon. Leon! - Oh, my wife! - Hurry up, we're late. Always at your service, sir. My tributes, Mrs. Rollo. Miss Alexa is not there? It would please me, their daughter. What it is pretty! With money, it's not difficult. And if we had money, you'd better. Do you think? - Hello, sir lady. - Hello my friend. Do you want to announce to Mr. Carradine? Monsieur has an appointment? Perfectly. - Can I get rid of Monsieur? - That, never. It's worth 1 billion. If Madam and Sir want to enter this show, I will announce them to Monsieur. You have passed the Potato! What? What a luxury! Crushing. Nasty. Yes. But what a good taste! In any case, is not so comfortable. Anyway. Sir. No, my dear friend. Not 40%, 60%. D & d agree? - This is your childhood friend. - Which ? - Potato. - What is he doing here? He says that he has an appointment with Monsieur. - What day are we? - Wednesday. I had to tell him Wednesday to get rid of it. - What should I do, sir? - Have him squirt. Weary of war, he will leave of himself. Then we are in agreement. Go to my office. I do not like to wait a long time. Wait, that is to hope. I do not like to hope for a long time. - Sir a sound? - It's been 20 minutes that we are waiting. And yes, sir. And yes. Have you announced to Mr. Carradine? Not yet, sir. Monsieur sleeps. - He's sleeping? At 11 o'clock ? - Yes sir. - Why? - Because at 11 am... Thank you, my friend. We will wait for his awakening. What are the latest news from the front? Well, as Mr , who is always very spiritual, would say The potato root. Do you know what I dream of, sometimes, so much I hate this Carradine? I imagine that he is lending me a large sum of money and that I make it to him lose voluntarily. You are stupid as a child. This is normal. Any child, I hated him already. From his birth, he took the advantage over me. We baptize Noel. Oh, Noel! And me, with the same 4 letters, N, O, E, L, we called Leon. - Leon! - This is very nice, Leon. Do you find? Yes. This is even spiritual, not very ordinary, artist. Leon. How lucky I was to have, Edith. You are... You are charming. You are a lovely girl. You are a charming girl Charming, charming Who has an innocent soul Innocent Ah! Then the enemy capitulates? No, no, sir. The potato sings. You are in my opinion, now. Carradine is paying for our heads. I'm afraid of it. Madam. There is more than an hour we are waiting for. Yes, madam! Eh yes ! What does Mr. Carradine do? Monsieur is taking a bath, ma'am. Do you think that before the night, it has come out of the water? I can not say, ma'am. - Come on, Leon. - Are we going? Yes. I laughed enough. So have some friends from childhood. Believe that Monsieur will be sorry. Miss Jeannette, please accompany Mrs. and Sir. - Leon. - Yes ? We are stupid. But yes. On leaving, we play the game of the enemy. We need to have wear. Victory, sir. The friend of Monsieur is flying away. Close the windows, that he does not come back anymore. - Adrien, you are a genie. - Yes sir. Sir. The gentleman did not leave. He has just sat down again, he says that he will wait for the day. He claims sandwiches and beer. What should I do? - Adrien, you are an idiot. - Yes sir. Alexa, I've talked a lot about you to my parents. - They would like to know you. - Oh, parents! Your parents ! I have everything I need at home, it's enough for me. Say, do you want to be nice? - You'll put me a record. - Agreed. - Oh, be careful! - The wind. Alibi. - He's fine, your sir X? - Very good, yes. I like it. I hope you do not do stupid things. Mass, it is Sunday. - Hello, my dear. - I'm in a rage. Do you know who goes up guard in the living room? - Potato. - No ? Yes, he's tearing me off an appointment to surprise me. And he's been here for almost 2 hours. - It is incrusted. - What does he want you? Ca, it's easy to guess. He takes me for the Bank of France. Poor Potato. It's nice to be concerned about a childhood friend who did not succeed, but take it to me for his cow! You have so often depanne. Exactly. This is once again too much. - Hello, Colette. - Hello sir. Oh, Christmas! We are so happy. It was he who introduced us. He should have made his price, at the beginning. My dear, it should sign here. Business after. The heart first. I'll see what he wants. In a few minutes, make an appearance. You will make me happy. Then I will do it. Leon, learn that you are there. - Edith! - Veronique! Noel is overflowing this morning. Leon, you waited. This is nice. I am very patient. We did not have to say to Christmas that your wife was there. He would have acted otherwise. With you, he does not feel embarrassed, my dear Potato. What a pleasure to see you. You are rejuvenating me. You do not need it, you are divine. Do not stay here, come for a drink. You will laugh. Storing old stuff, I came across a picture. We 4 in Le Touquet, there is ca... I dare not count anymore. Ah! Adrien, do you want to bring whiskey? And Perrier and ice. - Good, ma'am. - A lot of ice, I was hot. Oh, yes! I remember, it was on the beach. Come see, Leon. How's the little Alexa? She is growing up, she is very wise. What does Noel do? Now that he knows that you are here, he must be fine. What work! He has it for an hour. And here is an oasis that happens to us, pushed by a beautiful slave. Veronique. Here it is. Leon came to offer an excellent deal at Christmas. You have influence on your husband. I know what I say. So, if... Finally. You could say a sentence. It is already said, the sentence. And how's my good big old potato? Well, it's okay. It makes me happy to see you. I am sure of it. We were about to leave at one point. And then I thought: "He's going to have grief." Then I waited. You are a brave Potato. I want to eat you. The Potato has a regret. This is not to be a venomous mushroom. Here is a good start. And who promises. You're also more lovely, Edith. What did you do to merit a perfect woman? This is a question that I often ask myself about you. And you are wearing your heart in your eyes. - What a shame! - Where did she marry? That she does not accompany more often, I will support you better. You are not smart, but you are spiritual. But you are indulgent with me. Because I love you. And we love so much that I'm sure that you would ruin yourself to lend me money. Ah! My old Potato needs money. You understand quickly. You always give me to understand the same thing. Before talking business, I would like to show my veranda to Leon and Edith. - And my beautiful exotic birds. - Oh yes ! I love birds. It must be worth a fortune, these exotic birds. These are my associates from Africa who offered them to Veronique. She is gatee. She who at home already had a peacock. It's better than having a donkey. - Look, Leon. - Wonderful ! I become silent. Alas, we will not have this chance. Are we embarking? Come on, hop! And here it is! Watch out for the train. And hop! Youpi! So? Come. Feels lonely? Are we looking at the girls? We are grinding black? Here it is. This is an original game. Oh! It is very pretty. What is it? Well, that's the principle little horses, game of the goose, etc., but applies to astrology. 100 times better than the coffee grounds, the lines of the hand or the stars. Well, here. You start from your date of birth. The roulette you cast represents your personal strength in front of life, and the card you are drawing represents your inevitable destiny. Me, I find this amazing. No, is not it? A game like that costs nothing. A little advertising and hop! Like rolls. The ideal would be forbidden by the Church. This is fun. Clever. Do you want money on this game? Yes. I would need a small advance. Let's say 500,000 F. Alumni! I bought your patent. I give you 1 million cash, package. I will exploit the business myself. It will please in America. How to "1 million cash package"? Yes. You ask me 500 tickets. I offer you 1 million, I am kind. If you offer me double, it's great. Otherwise, I'll put you in my head. So you rob me, you exploit me, you take me by the throat. - Christmas! - Leon, 1 million! I do not want any of your million. With this game, you will win billions. - Business is business. - The bastards are the bastards. You are an ungrateful, sweet potato. T have always been lucky. It's my turn. Stop, you make me laugh. Your laugh will be less beautiful when you miss some teeth. You can take it away, your game. Here! This is not a game of goose, it's a mecano. Damn, go! My dear, I believe that we must whistle the half-time. And take them to take the air. Leon, do you want... Christmas! Leon, Leon. Stopped. Christmas ! But, Christmas, finally! - You are imbeciles and thugs. - And you proud! You always have to do great benefits. Let. I give 10% more on profits. - 50%. - Potatoes, it's crushed. One more word and I do not sell you my patent. - Chick! - They are not frequentable. Go! 25% and we talk more. - Do you agree? - Yes. Shake hands. My dear, it was a tough day. But a blessed day. - Alexa! - But she's in class. Lesson of course, look. My father! Do you have an explanation to give me? - The math teacher is sick. - Liar! Folks have just paid for ice cream. They are thugs, dirty little kids of rich people. We will settle it at home. For the moment, arrange your hair. Your mother and I have just handled a case with the Carradines. Since time you have not seen them. I do not want to see the Carradine. They are snobs. Go! Walk where I twist your neck. Here is Alexa, our devil. My God, how she grew up! I would have never recognized it. I imagined it still being 10 years old. With her mats. - Here it is. - What are you doing here at this time? The friends wanted to pay me an ice cream. Sit down, you'll have it, your ice cream. - Did you cut your mats? - Mats" ? Why not a romper? Raising a child is more complicated than finding a sponsor. Did you buy daddy's invention? Yes. And I hope to do it with a fortune. If you do good business, plus. "In addition" of what? In addition to being rich. - Do you go to college or? - During St. Thomas. And you prepare what? The holidays. You must have a lot of success. Oh yes! Millions of flirts. His college friends, I know them. Alexa does not hide anything Even though daddy made them all run away. What fools, anyway! Oh no! Except one. - But it's Jean-Francois. - Yes. My respects, madam. Hello, Mr. Carradine. - Do you know each other? - Yes. This is fun, life. Mrs. and Mr. Rollo. Mr. Jean-Francois de Bellac. - The Bellac bank? - Yes. - Your father is doing well. - Very good. Thank you. Do you know him? No But I want to know him. He runs a factory. For my patents. Mr. Rollo, dare I ask you a favor? I beg you. Can I accompany Miss Alexa to class? Lovely boy, he brings her back to school. For once that's not a black jacket. - Granted. - Thank you sir. - Quickly, Alexa. You have to hurry. - OK. Goodbye. Hi, you! She's funny, your daughter. She makes a lot of noise, but she is shy, like me. And she is nice, like you. In short, I have two children. You are lucky. I do not even have one. And our game go around the world. Another bottle! Champagne hurts you. Me, he succeeds me. Send, Mr. Leon. - Hello. - Where are you? This is me. You are beautiful like a princess, Miss Alexa. I am invited to a literary evening, by a young man from a good family. Are you leaving? Since daddy opened the cage, I am going to a next party. If you want. So, repair my tennis racket first. We'll see after, huh! Good evening. She's going out? She's going out now? - Why? - Exceptional permission. For Bellac factories. Say, you are beautiful like a star. To court my daughter? Now that we are going up a business together, it would be great if she and I... Maxime. I love you, I love you. My little devil. This is terrible, huh! - I'll never get there. - But yes, you're great. Where are you tonight? Me? At a literary evening. And you? At a meeting reserve officers. And what were you doing 6 months ago? I was in a cinema, to meet a female collegian. - Who likes you. - What? Who loves you! Let's have a drink in our studio? Oh no! I still want to dance. So let's change the box. Pile, we're going. - Stack. - I lost. One is not better here? It changes. What head did I do, to the Bois de Boulogne! And me! A true novel-serial. Do you like me? Oh yes! You write, funny things in your letters, Maxime. Are we going home? Pile, we go home. Stack! Oh! A faked piece. There are 2 times "stack". Well yes. I have cut 2 pieces, like that. And I have stuck the 2 "stack". For you. And the 2 "face", who is it for? For your wife? Do you like me? Oh yes! If I was 10 years younger, would you like me? Of course. And if I was 10 years older, would you still like me? What an idea! Ugly and infirm? Now, everything is equal. And what if your father learned everything and locked up in the evening? How long would you like? Shortly. Yes. I am dying of it. But you? And me? I... I would die too. You, would you divorce to marry me? Oh, be reasonable! Reasonable is a word of your age, not mine. Ca, you'll pay me. Marcel! - But it's not ok. - I'll tell you something. Shut up, Mimile. Stop, name of God! Stop. The carpenter made holes of 24, holes of 25 were needed. - Well, what? But 24. - I wrote in fly paste. Ca, it's a hard blow. But that's not all. I wanted to tell you something. Shut up, Mimile! We received a recommended Carradine. What does he want? He wants 50 games before Saturday, otherwise he retires. - Oh, cow! - What are we going to do? - We start everything again. - I have more money. - Me neither. - Huh! But there were 80 tickets left. - I bought myself a suit. - "A costume" ? I was in danger of having receptions. Receptions... This is funny. I have never, receptions. This is fun. Come on, come on! Top hearts ! We have in our hands a game that will upset the world. I wanted to tell you something. With my grandmother, we played your game. There is a bone. We can not go beyond 55 years old. My grandmother who is 70, she was laughing. - Who is there? - That's me. I went to take the accounts of the shop. As no one is having lunch, I am doing housework. But at Alexa, what a mess! She lets everything drag, she breaks everything. She defeats her chair, and his small furniture, the drawer does not close anymore. Madam, the drawer does not close anymore. This is nothing, it is the wood that played. If it goes on, I do not do this room anymore. I'm going to the living room. Oh, this Alexa! She is in a mess. It will play him a nasty trick. This is not possible. Alexa! This is not possible. "Maxime." Maxime? A letter for me? No But a package. The remaining post, agree. But I warn you, not the mandates. Today, a perfume. And tomorrow, Cadillac? Why not? Could you offer me one, you Cadillac? Have you seen, Popol? I've already seen it, but like that, never. Hello? Hello, Maxime? - Hello? - That's me. But you are crazy! I told you to never call me here. Thanks for the fragrance. This is nothing. No, it's nothing. See you soon. I write for our appointments. Listen, I'm calling especially to tell you that I can be free tonight. I'm supposedly going out with my classmates, but if you want, we can meet at 10 pm. D & agree. Yes, agreed, 22 h. Goodbye. I adore you. Where is it? - That's me. - Ah! You were there ? Yes. I telephoned, I did not see you enter. I came to rest a book. Ah! You do not forget tonight. "Tonight"? This is our reception tonight. Yes, of course. There will be all Paris. I'm counting on you to welcome the guests. It goes without saying, my dear. So in tuxedos, at 9 pm. 21 h? So soon? Yes. Why ? You are not free? Yes, if. Of course. Agreement, 9 pm - What do you feel? - A perfume. - Offered by whom? - An admirer. - When he burst! - What admirer? - Guess. - An old ? A minister ? Oh, the, the! If you tell us, I pay a meal to everyone. So, that's interesting. Well, here! - This fragrance was offered by... - By...? This old schnock of science teacher, Dad Bichard, who made "the war with your father, mademoiselle". "This is the inevitable and generous spring." Well, what's wrong with you? That does not make you laugh? Miss Rollo, I will advise to your father to make you leave this college and to put you in a circus. So what are you looking for? And who did you find them? Yes. Did you tell who? To anyone. So much better! What is all you have to say? Little bitch! Mom! You have a lover. Well yes. And how did you do...? Well, like everyone else. Who is this man? You do not know him. Yes, Maxime. Maximize how? He does not call Maxime. This is an agreed name between us. - Why invent a false name? - I do not know. For fun. This is a married man. How do you know? In his letters, he talks about his wife. But you can never be happy with a married man. "Happy", the big words. Young people, there is no future. Shut up! Your father. What will you say to your father? Do not tell him. But I will not be able to lie to him. - But why? - Because I like it. What generation! I hate this man and the horrors he dares to write. Give me the letters, mom. "I like to walk you around like a golf course." He finds me sexy. "Our evening appointments are for me as blessings of Heaven. " And when I kiss you, my dear... " It is love. "Your pink lips, your big eyes, "your little nose..." Ca, that's nice. There is nothing to say. "I count every second that separates me from you. " Your body is a miracle. " This is a man who can write, at least. You have received letters of d & apos love and you read them to your girl? - Leon! - Do you have a lover? And you're boasting? This is the crowning of my potato career. I'm cuckold! It's not your age, stay here! Come on, get out here! Remember, Berthe, hold on! It's not your business . Give me these letters. Like that, there is a guy who has discovered that your body is a miracle? - I already told you, in 1947. - I remember, Leon. Me who thought I had married a saint. - Is this true? - Gherkin, I should have doubted it. You are too pretty. Oh, God's name! "I like the way you lift your skirts." Let me see that, and quickly. In 20 years, I have never been entitled to this number. But you're jealous, Leon? You are jealous. What a junk, this guy! - Who is it? - Exactly, I do not know. C & c is that. And in addition, you pay my head. Maxime. Maxime who? Answer something. When I say the truth, you will be sad. - This is done. - Even more trouble. Thank you, for this scene of jealousy. This was a delightful scene of love. You love me, Leon. You are diverting the conversation. Do you know that I can flank you a rump to send to the hospital? This is true? At the hospital? Ah, you will have wanted! Dad, be reasonable. We do not write to mom such aneries. To me, yes. - To you, yes. - Yes. These letters are mine. You are a good little girl, you try to save your mother. Read the letters, dad. He calls me by my name. Yes. "I'm proud of you, my little Alexa, " because you reinvent love. " You? Poor mother who was accusing me in my place. Oh It gives me great pleasure. - Say something. - What do you want me to say? That I am proud that our daughter has reinvented love. He says that to write. Ask forgiveness to your mother who is allowed to insult. No, no. I am very happy. What a beautiful day! Too bad it's a tragedy. "A drama"? It was already more drama before the war. Here. I am 15 years old... Who is the bastard? - I do not want to say it. - You refuse ? We will see. Who is he? You will tell me who it is. Why do you want to know who it is? To kill him. Pan! Hello? Yes. Hello? Ben. Name of God, who is it? Hello? Nobody. Before killing him, I'll have to get this guy to marry. - Impossible. - Why ? He is married. Ah! Maxime is married. This is already good news. Edith, you know more things than you would like to say. - Ca, no. - Do you know who Maxime is? Thank God, no. I would have told you. In addition, he does not call Maxime. Ah! He does not call Maxime. So, Alexa! What is his real name? - Fernando. - Fernando? He is stranger ? Yes. He's spanish. Oh! A Spanish. That explains the letters. They are sensual, the Spaniards. - I knew one in 1932. - Oh, Carmen! It's okay ! Good, Mr. Adrien. Sir, it is the nurseries who bring the plants. Do for the best. I miss an hour. If Madame asks or went to Monsieur? Well, say what you want. Sir can count on me. The. A little higher. Very good. Very good. Thank you. - Adrien. - Mrs ? Do you know where is Monsieur? He went to his lawyer, madam. - His lawyer? - His lawyer. Very good. Thank you. I have not seen you for a long time. Hello, Eugene. I need you to do me a favor. I had an appointment with a young woman. And I have to cancel it. - She is at home with her parents. - As usual. - You are perfect. - Too kind. We will arrange this. - What is the number. - Montmartre 28-49. You ask for anything. Just to know who answers. I do not want to recognize my voice. Understood. So Mr. X is married. And Spanish? Hello? What? The radius of umbrellas? This is not Galeries Lafayette. What is the father's voice? I know him. This writing is familiar. See, Leon. I'll tell you. - Mom. - This is true. It's better that I do not guess. The "M". I saw these "M's" somewhere. You will see. I will disguise my voice. Hello? The restaurant of Mere Poulard? Say. Do you still have a table? Yes, but I do not have any more chairs. Not only am I having problems with Carradine, not only my daughter has a lover, but in addition it is necessary that the automatic telephone deraille. And we pay taxes! - What's that? - Your trumpet. - Which trumpet? - It rings the doorbell. He will end up betraying himself, this guy. Patience. - Hello. - What do you want ? I would like to say a word to Alexa. What kind of word? - Here it is. - Is it you? Yes, yes. This is me. Alexa is in love with you? - She told you? - Saligaud! A man! A cat! Mr. Leon, you are crazy. Oh, the phone! - Hello? - May I speak to Mr. Rollo? For an interesting case. Do not leave. Shit! - Who is it? - Michalon. Oh, shit! You already said it. Hello? Here Leon Rollo, the inventor. Commissioner. Would not you have found my red-haired cocker spaniel? Si. But we eat it. You'll tell me what you want, but these mistakes, it's not normal. He is hurting. It must quickly lie on my bed. Oh, you, miss! It's okay ! Take care of your cat. - I want to know who Maxime is. - No. But rest assured, I will not make scandal. On the contrary, you would be too happy. What an opportunity for you! "What opportunity"? So I know him. So I have with him more or less unpleasant memories. I'm burning. Poor Marcel. I will excuse you. Oh! Professor. Is Mr Rollo the? - Yes. Leon. - What is it? Ah, Bichard! I came to find you to talk to you about some relationships which have worsened between Alexa and myself. The old bastard! He, with whom I made war! But there is no question of that. The temperament of your daughter... Concierge, do not let anyone go. No But do not insist. Try one last time, Eugene. Oh, no! This is always the type that responds. - I do not know what to invent. - Ask... Oh! What? Ask for instructions from Saint-Lazare station. Let's go! This is because it is you. - Hello? - What? What? But no. This is not the instruction of the Saint-Lazare station. Oh! That, then! The instruction of the Saint-Lazare station. Oh, for example! That's it, I found. I know who it is. No? Oh no! This is not possible! I will not have that chance. Him ? - What happiness! - But explain yourself. But it's Maxime. This is dear Maxime who calls without stop, to try to talk to Alexa. And he invents anerie on anerie. But he has just betrayed himself. The stroke of the order Saint-Lazare, I did it with him, when girls were telephoned to find out if their old ones were there. Maxime, that's the big bastard of Noel Carradine. This is not true! - But that's not true? - No. This is not true. Finally I hold it! Oh, those 20 years of humiliation, he will pay me. When I think that I broke the mouth has 2 real friends and that I insulted my wife, my Edith. A model of virtue. Damn! I am tired of passing for a saint. We try to have. - What? - Carradine tried in 1948. So he needs the whole family. I'll break it, this Carradine. Here. Like that. It sounds. If this is the big man's voice, drop it, do not insist anymore. Miss? Do not leave, we are talking to you. - Hello, Alexa? - Yes. I had completely forgotten I have a big party, tonight, at home. I will not be free. Ben. We must cancel our appointment. Let's see right now, I have one free hour. Right now? Oh, my little devil! I jump in a taxi. D here 10, rue de Balzac, I have it for 15 min. Hang up fast, you never know. I love you. - And here it is! - Here is ! - Thank you, Eugene. - Thank you sir. See you soon. Looking forward to seeing you again. Perfect. This is despicable. Perfectly, Leon. - In war as in war. - This trap is shameful. Go! In prison, the handsome Carradine. Ah, I understand! This is no longer me who is involved. You want to satisfy your pride. Yes. But I can take revenge on him, and you will not buy me this pleasure. - Come on, come on! - Mom ! No No. The! Loop. Cherie, where are you going? I will avenge my honor. 10, rue Balzac. Come on, you're ridiculous! All I know is that I am a bomb that will explode. The potato will explode. What to do to prevent them from fighting? Alexa, do not move. I will follow him. We will see what we will see. A bomb, I tell you. Boom! Here it is! I beg you, do not hold her head. He is in crisis. He has a lion's food. Hello. Excuse me. Is this my little bird scratching? Cui-cui! Oh, that's it! - This is a surprise, huh? - Yes. I saw you enter the building, so I followed you. - Oh good? - I wanted to talk to you - But what a coincidence. - Chance would have it. If this is for the history of the game of goose, do not worry. T will have all the necessary credits, Leon. But you're nice. I'll ask you... I'm waiting for someone. I would not want you to cross. I know? No No, she is a married woman. Ah! I am Alexa who makes me worry. Oh yes? Your kid? Yes. My girl. She has a lover. I have discovered letters. He calls himself Maxime. Do you want a drink? So I told you that Alexa has a lover. A married guy. Kind don Juan gigolo. An old schnock of our ages, what. Very rich and very pig. - Do you follow me? - Very good. But I think I know who it is. Minor diversion, 5 years. And in addition, the wife of this bastard is billionaire. And she loves him with jealousy. She will divorce. And here is my type falls in the grave. A real potato in perspective. Do you follow me? But before ruining it, I intend to break the portrait, this bastard. You are drunk. Get out here. The strike of the order Saint-Lazare lost. Degueulasse! My kid! Finally, Noel! My kid. I like it better when you shout, Leon. Let's play fair. I love your daughter. C & c is that. And in 48, in Biarritz, you loved my wife. - Ca, never! - Liar. But I find Edith delicious. But this is not my type. Ah? Good. She is boasted to make herself interesting? Well, I look good! That's it! Biarritz, the pier, the fishermen's inn, the lemon roll. "The lemon roll", I remember. Ah, anyway! I offered you to... And I did not want to. - How could I forget about it? - Indeed. How could you? When I think that Dr. Joubert, Jacques Leblot, Corbier, Grandvilliers and many others have made love to you, that you have them discouraged, and you persist in loving this good old big potato. But what do you find him? I'll tell you. But they do not care about my mouth, besides. Christmas, Christmas! Are you ok, you have nothing? Leon! Stop being lost. Christmas, go! Do you want to let me go? You are robbing me of my revenge. Name of God, he escapes me. No You will not go out. Leon, you will not go out. You too, you are in love with Carradine. I just want to prevent making a scandal. You will not prevent me from making a scandal. - Come see. - What? - Look, the. - But what is there? Here! Like your daughter, locked up. She is enervated. Mom! I'm sure that it's a love story. Leon. Leon, open me! Leon, do you want to open! Leon? Leon? Thanks, huh! Thank you. Good. Ah! For once, I have vein. Mom, what are you doing here? Later, our explanations. We must prevent the worst. You can be proud. I have the impression that I am well. Good evening, ma'am. Good evening sir. - Sir. - Announce me to Mr. Carradine. Mister is not here. He left in emergency for his factory in Alsace. Oh, the coward! He ran away. He does not lose anything to wait. Good. Good evening, ma'am. Good evening sir. Come here, Robert. Replace me. That's it. The stooge had me. If you do not go to Potato, Potato will go to you. That's it, sir. It came. Oh! So what ? I told him what you said. He grumbled, but he left. Ah! Thank you. Madam reclaims Sir. Many guests have already arrived. Tell him for midnight, hurry up! - Ben. Hi guys ! - Hello ! Hi! - Yes? - So, do you believe yourself or? - Come on, go around! - Good. I wait for him. Would you know where is Monsieur? Is it at this time that we arrive? 1 hour late! Put on your jacket, hurry up! You're going to get bawled. Go! Put on your jacket. - My jacket? - What do you do? But hurry up! - Is that you, the extra? - Yes. Go quickly take that in the living room. Quick ! C is here. Ah, I'm a potato! - Dear Madam. - Ah, my dear teacher! - Adrien. - Mrs. - His Eminence is it arrived? - No Madam. I would have seen him. Good evening, dear lady. What a lovely toilet! I steal a cake. - My respects, madam. - Minister. - Oh, Eminence! - Hello. What a pleasure for me. Madam, Mrs. and Miss Rollo are waiting for Madam in the entrance. They say that it is urgent. Very good. Thank you. - I beg your pardon. - You're welcome. Tell me, mom. Do you think Carradine loves me really, really? He's saved like a coward. Edith. What is happening? Veronique, I'm sorry, but have you seen Leon? Leon? No, no. So much better. Explain yourself. Well, here! Leon and Noel fought. Defeated? But why ? Oh! A stupid story. Ah! Noel said that he had sent Leon a hard letter. Yes. This is it. So Leon pursues Noel to... maybe break his nose. You have nothing to fear. Leon is not here. - All the better. - Let us know. Adrien, did not you see Mr. Rollo? Si. It's about 30 minutes. He asked to speak with Sir. - But... - But what? But he saw that we had reception and he left. I will still see if he has not tried to introduce him through the service. Gentlemen, ladies. Would you have seen a man in civilian clothes go by? wearing on the forehead an albuplast band? I saw one, but there was no albuplast. Ca, that's the tile. Would you have seen Mr.'s friend? The potatoe ? "The Potato"? But what potato? - Still you? - Here! I thought you were in Alsace. But how did you go to get here? Luck, Noel. Luck. She turned. You have had too much luck, up here. It's over. - Now you have to pay. - Pay what? All this incredible happiness which you have made such bad use. Oh, it's okay! So what? Then I have in my pocket 8 letters signed "Maxime", that I will offer Veronique with the necessary explanations. You'll find yourself in the street without a penny. A potato. Ah! Here we are ! The revenge of mediocre. Say what you want, it's equal. You dream to see me in prison. I will carry you oranges. - You will not have this pleasure. - We'll see. - Veronique will decide. - Leon! - You will not do that. - Why ? You are not going to stab Veronique this way. She had only to keep her Casanova at home. We are old friends. You have me for 25 years. Be indulgent. Think about your family. You've ransacked it, my family. Think about our memories of high school. That's what you called me Potato. But listen. You do not want my money, you do not want to be indulgent. What do you want? That I kill myself? Excellent idea. - Are you sick? - No ! Yes, indeed. C & you are right. I have no other way out. Scandal, poverty, shame, dishonor, I do not want it. Better death. Leon. If you swear to tear me off the letters after I die, I am ready to pay this price. D & agree. I will tear them down. I have confidence. Thank you. Leon, my old Leon. Christmas. What are you doing? But you are crazy! It will be thought that this is an accident. Only you will know that you have revenge. Royally. I hope you enjoy it I die, Leon. It makes me happy, of course. Thank you, you are very nice. But finally, life! All the same ! Life. Life... No I do not want a death on my conscience yet. Bastard! The suicide shot. You did it 20 times, and I walked. My colonel? Eminence! The Potato! I know where I saw it. Go! On the way, Carradine. Go! Faster than that. - By the. - Ah, here you are! Me looking to carry the petits-fours. Quick ! The upstairs, ma'am. I saw him. I saw it, up there! Advance by the. Enter the. Come on, get in there. - But no. Why ? - Or I crushed it in the figure. Go! Faster than that ! Advance. Come on, I tell you. I have a surprise for you. Did you think I escaped among your guests? But I have my plan. But what are you going to do? These 2 glazed doors give in the large living room where your guests are waiting? Yes. Why ? You'll go on your knees here. I will open all these two doors. And your guests will see you in a grotesque position. And I will be revenge. Leon. - Are not you going to do that? - Yes ! And I do not play the comedy. Yes, Leon. I have all the wrongs. But with what you do me, you repay yourself. With profits. Kneeling, Carradine. Hurry, Leon. Do it fast! Perfect. Good. This is not beautiful, a man who is afraid. Well, you see, Noel! It does not amuses me anymore, to fuck your life on the ground. I would be disgusted. I am an honest man. Everyone can not say that much. Potato! They are here, ladies. Oh, here they are! Still alive, it's a chance. Good evening, ladies. What a surprise ! It seems that Leon and you, you're still arguing? Yes. But this is the last time. And it's Leon who won. Win? Yes. I won, but I lost. In beauty? I believe. Dad has upset your evening, Mr. Carradine. Oh, that's nothing! I just wanted to say that it was a bit my fault, he was so nervous. Because he discovered that I had a love in town and... - A love? - Oh no ! I thought so too, but you know, in the head of girls of my age, These things often take it too much importance. - Do you like him, this man? - Yes and no. What I'm sure of, is that he does not really like me. He is too afraid of his responsibilities. It scrolls. It hurts me, but since it's over, he stays with his wife. He has a wife? You were very foolish to trust the words of a married man. What did you expect? When he leaves his wife. And he did not want to leave his wife. Oh, no! No. She is too rich. He is afraid of it. Fear? Fear of his wife? But that's ridiculous. Christmas, is not it that is ridiculous? Yes. Anyway, it is not serious. I have grown. This Maxim-my gives my majority. Ah! Because he's called Maxime? Oh, no! It's still a name he invented. This is not elegant. In this Maxime, maybe that there was room for 2 loves. Do not defend him. This is so far from you, my dear, this kind of man, who clings to youth. Now, you have to go home, my dear. Goodbye, Veronique. Farewell, Mr. Carradine. Farewell. Farewell. I'll have you escorted by the driver. You should not play with the heart of a little girl. He will mend, his heart. He will mend very, very quickly. But my heart has me... Your heart is fine, Noel. He is the age of your wife. But I love Veronique. That's why I got down on my knees. About. You have asked me a question which I could not answer. You have received a chair on your head. You are surprised that I love Leon and you wonder why. Well, I'll tell you. Thanks, Edith. Since then, I have had the answer. Sacre Leon. Sir, we are asking you. All Paris is there. Oh, Alexa! Dad, mom. This is the young girl I mentioned to you. Alexa. Already leaving? Yes. What do you want me to do ? I'm going to bed. - Dear friend. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. Dad, mom. Allow me to accompany Miss Rollo to her home. - Excellent idea. - That I approve. Are you coming, Leon? Edith, I beg your pardon. I have a wonderful wife, smart, pretty. And I offered him only cries and complaints against bad luck. But my luck... This is you. Then hold her tightly in your arms, your luck. We are still at age where happiness suits us well. Let's enjoy it. Well, say so! My parents finally bought a car. And here it is! But who is this charming girl? Well, that's... How do you say? A godchild. Come. Alexa made a conquest. The son of Mr. and Mrs. Bellac. They left together. So much better. It will arrange his business, to this brave Leon. A banker son-in-law. It would not be so soon that he was finally lucky. Our guests are waiting for us. Are you coming, Maxime? Am I stupid? This story with Alexa m impressed. Come on, Noel? Friend of the Family (Patate) 1964
