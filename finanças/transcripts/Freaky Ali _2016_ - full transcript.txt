Chief, these people just gave 7000 rupees. I added own 4000 rupees. - I thought I would feel bad, and ... - Okay, get out. Boss! Ahead. Look who I brought. Ya, it's your father. Hi Uncle. Head, not my father. I first listen. The boss does not like it completely. The boss is not going to end not with a girl. Right, boss? If not your father, who is? Its very good.

He has forgotten where he hid all the money and gems. If you have lost your memory, what good is? Why did you bring? What if he retracts to recover memory? If he stays, he will be with us. When you retrieve the memory, We obtain all their property. How did you recover? Son, I heard that eating nuts and almonds It helps restore memory. Great, man. Remember nuts, but no where to put the money. - Boys. - Yes Boss. Give him what he wants, but should recover the memory. Business is loose. And to make matters worse, the Big Boss puts pressure. Jojo, what about that old? Chief, that old is very clever. Always has an excuse. Do not you serve me for nothing. This old man does not know where your money. And that old remembers everything, but you do not want to pay. I wonder when get paid. Hey, old, why not pay? It does much to make excuses. For the last time, are you going to pay or not? That tongue! Do not you know who you're talking about? With Padmavati, Queen Nawallgarh district. Long live the Queen! Highness, what is the problem to pay protection? We do not charge that money for personal gain. It's for your safety. I am a Rajput. I can protect myself. It is understood! What else is going to do at this age? It's a queen, not a maid. We will give you security. I will not live much longer. Maybe five or ten years. That's his problem. We did not tell you was born so soon. - Right, Maqsood? - Yes. Listen, Your Highness. This is my first collection. That's why I'm polite. But this man is very dangerous. I brought a guy that does not end up killing someone. Look at that. I'm like your child. My son is not a scoundrel like you. It is a crown prince, you know? ¿Yuvraj Singh is his son? Stupid, it is the prince of our family. If you had been here, he would have beheaded with a sword. Chief, give me two punches. Let's go. It is bothering a lot. Hey, witch, who called? Ramu, open the door. Ramu is tied. Highness, open the door. - Who is, Maqsood? - I do not know. I come to collect water filter. Yes. Payment is ready since yesterday. - Thirty-two thousand rupees. - Yes. And 1000 rupees tip that I give. - Haunted. - Thank you. Have money to pay, and we? Long ago we asked. Try not get me money like you. He worked hard to install the filter. We have also worked hard, we've asked you to pay. We hours here. There has not given us no water! Have you bought the filter for swimming? I am a queen. What do you care if it is to bathe or drink? Who is now Maqsood? Highness, here is the certificate million donated for our NGO. - Thank you. - Thank you. It has given our money to the NGO. It's my last warning, ma'am. Will you pay or not? Decide first what is your last warning. You've said several times: "It's my last warning." - This was the last. - Maqsood, a moment. Calm. Highness, a shroud has no pockets. And you can not transfer your money up there. Remember the old days when he wasted money without concern. - Ten. Taking. And you. - What? His treasure among the poor. Son, you've opened my eyes. I'll get the money already. If I had not paid today, he would have killed. No, Maqsood. The words solve problems that bullets can not. Who wants the money first? - Los dos. - Maqsood. Put down the gun, ma'am! ¡No! - Now you try to talk? - I'll try. Long live the Queen! Shame for the Queen! Drop the gun, ma'am. Release. Give me the gun. You want money. You want money! Ten. Take your money. Taking. - Let you! - Shut up! Are you going to hit a woman? No, right? - Let go hand! - Did I break your hand? Did I break your hand? Hag, I curse you. Joints will hurt you until you die. The worms will eat your body. You'll end up in the ICU. You'd be given injections, witch! Witch? Your children... - Witch! - Let go. Release him! - Let's go. - Old witch. Say "Larga life to the queen." Maqsood, is very dangerous. Let's get the money and get out. Let's go. - Let's go. - Come on. Hi boss. Work done. Come on, boy. - Hey, boss Khatarnak (danger). - In hindi no! Sorry, boss Danger. Podíais know that you do it easily. - Chief, this reminds me of a joke. - Tell me. There were two guys. One day they will find an old job. But... If then. There, boss. End of joke. Only with this job I gained more than it would have earned selling underpants one month. What happened, Ali? And these brands? - Is a tattoo. Want one? - Do not. - Piérdete. - ¡rogue! scoundrel often. That old twisted my arm so much that I jumped eyes. - Ali, come play this game. - Come to play. Come on, brother. It is the reputation of the people. You have already lost reputation. Matter who plays, he or Dhoni. If you win today, I'll give a prize to everyone. Shut. - How many races are needed? - Only 24. - How many balls are? - Four. ... Twenty four races ... That's four sixes in four balls. Yes brother. Are you crazy? - Well, we have won. - See how Farda. - Give me the bat. - Shut up. Are you ready! Let's go. Get the ball. Get lost. Brothers, four sixes. Ready. Let's go. I'll do four six four balls. I'll tell you where. - Where should I give the first six o'clock? - Already. Look at that pitcher. - That false abroad? - Yes. It is the neighborhood Brett Lee. Play. - Six! - Bravo, Ali. One more! It's okay. Bravo! Let's play. Lanza right, man. Where I hit the second six o'clock? There. - At that antenna? - Yes. Come launches. DON Whitey! What do you do? Lanza well. Where I launched the third? Lánzalo there. - There? - Yes. - Okay, spear. - Let's go. Bravo, Ali, one more. Damn bottle of milk. Stop giving bad name Brett Lee. Last ball, the last six. - Where? - Stop asking. Launches wherever you want. Come launches. Bravo, you'll catch. - Another six, Ali. - Dale, Ali. We have won! We have won! Give back to this false Brett Lee to Australia! You've been amazing, Ali. Aunt, food smells good. What have you done to your face? All day on the streets. Metiéndoos in fights. Stop it, Mom. Here's the money. Thank God, business is going well. You too you hurt? Well, you have to sweat blood for a living! It's hard earned money. Look. - hard-earned money. - Yes! You work hard and the other one gets into fights. Listen mom, fix the roof before the monsoon. Or we end up with a pool at home. Vale. Ali, stay away from him. I do not like your manners. What would your political family if he knew? Political family? Are you married? Where's the sister? Sister in law! Still he not married, but I will. His political family comes in two days. For their commitment. And later... A peacock came flying It seemed silly but it taught me to dance Turn up the speaker volume and tell everyone We will not stop dancing until morning When someone plays the drums We can not stop I can not do more than dance Dance till dawn I can not do more than dance Dance till dawn A peacock came flying It seemed silly but it taught me to dance Today we will not listen to anyone And we descontrolaremos menearemos body Today we will not listen to anyone And we descontrolaremos menearemos body Ballad We are going to have a very good time Music will be high We dance to the rhythm and pass well When someone touches the drum We can not stop I can not do more than dance Dance till dawn I can not do more than dance Dance till dawn I can not do more than dance Dance till dawn Enough of this farce! This commitment is canceled! - What do you say? - It is true. Liar, cheater! I can not let my daughter marry with an underwear salesman. Do you sell underwear? I think it is wrong. I am not mistaken. In fact, we chose the wrong family. What is he saying? My son works in the garment industry. Perhaps he forgot to mention the word "interior". There is a big difference between "clothes" and "underwear". And that? What if my son sells underwear? At least does something respectable. Work hard. My son is not a gangster or a thug. We just know your business. Who knows what else we'll know tomorrow? Then get out. Find another suitor for his daughter. ¡Váyanse! Let's go. Ali, I just saw that the world moves for money. If you had a car, a bungalow and all the luxuries of the world, nobody would have asked about your business. Large companies sell underwear. Has anyone married to them? Maqsood, I'm not sad to cancel my commitment. I'm sad because I did mourn my mother. Although she belonged to a different community, I was educated in my religion. And today she cried because of me. That's what saddens me. Your mother is very strong. Have you not seen how shushed those guys? Let's forget this and get back to work. But today I saw something. The world moves for money. Come underpants or hell. Brother, get up. We need the chair. They have canceled my commitment, have been guests and my wife, Already you're worried about your chair! Take it! Come on man. - It broke my shoe, Maqsood. - Yes. Congratulations for your wedding! ¡Do! I'm spoiled and congratulated me. Let's go. What do you play? - golf. - golf? Yes. It's like marbles. It is a sport rich. But with large marbles. And they use a stick to get the marble in the hole. What do you do? I guess Singhania has no children. How do you know? He has not gotten a single ball in the hole. What would you like, sir? - Can you get a little house in Bandra? - No sir. Then why do you ask? You should ask: "What would you like to eat?" I wanted to say... But I have no fault of his own house. - Bring two cups of tea. - Well sir. I do not understand, man. Do we come to collect protection or butane? - That man does not respect us. - Wait, talk to him. Singhania, sir. you could not get a single ball. He thinks it's easy. It's not that difficult. Come here. I mean it. - Come on. - I'm going. Note, this is a stick, a ball and that there is a hole. Goes. Forget it. Do it, Maqsood. You come. They do not give so good? Come on. - That hole with the flag? - Yes. - Voucher? - Yeah, okay. Faster, more. - Give him another. - Yes sir. This was easy. Genial. Other! Quick! Ready? Is nothing. Let's go. - Let's go. - Come on, Maqsood. What are we doing here? - Make the putt. - What? Put the ball in the hole. - Give putter. - Yes sir. - I can do this too. - Ten. - From here? - Yes. Sido not repay. - sido not repay. - ¿pay? You take three hours playing and have not given once a fluke. Oh yeah? Give this. - In the same hole? - Yes. It has also entered. This too. Is. - Great, Ali. - Anything else? How did you do it? - He spent no more. - What do you mean? Since childhood I know all about holes. Holes in my home, on the road in my life. I know more about these holes holes. Mr. Singhania, enough holes. Let's talk about money. Bring the briefcase. - Let's go. - Thank you. Thank you. - How did you do it? - I'll tell you when I know. What is he doing here? Is our "Old Monk" local? Let's move on. Hide it. First he hid the underwear business. And now this? You see when it comes. I think the old man has told everything to my mother. Ali, why do you go to sneak into your house like a thief? Go to hell, man! God! Broom! Cleaning path. Ali, what are you doing outside? Enters. Come in. What? - What is this that you have told me? - What? - Nothing. - What do you mean? Ali, I told you everything. You play good golf. - It's just ... - What? I missed the bus for your game. You know that today out of pilgrimage. - Could not you come before? - You can go tomorrow. - Leave it alone. - I'll go tomorrow morning. - A day after is the same. - My tea. What do you do? - We must talk business. - Let him finish the tea. You scared me, man. I thought you were telling Mom about my business. Son, still not what I said. But if you no amendments, I will tell. Come on, man. Bribe an innocent boy of thirty-four years for a few thousand rupees! If you needed money, you could have said. I would have given it. I do not want your illegal money, keep it. Uncle, listen to me. Why do not you take it? Listen to me. I get it. Wait. It is common at this age. Deepa Bar in there is a girl named Sonam. It is usual Maqsood. You know what I mean. - I will tell. - What? - Sit down. - What do you do? I hope you have sports. - Sports? - Yes. Why? - If there raid, you have to run. - Gross! What meanest thing? Maqsood company has spoiled you. Uncle, do not want money or girls. Have you changed your preference? Stop barking and listen. I want you to stop this illegal business and play golf. - to play what? - golf. Why did not you marry. You do not know what to play, when and with whom! I spent my childhood trying to make a living. And now that almost make it, tell me to play. Dude, I just want to make money. Money buys everything. The talent. That is not purchased. Talent I've seen you today, is not achieved even with all the money in the world. But I will show your talent to the world. I just want your support. And my business? And the household expenses? America Will he help me? The course gives a lot of money, Ali. And it's respectable. Follow my advice. Learn golf for me and play with dedication. It's your chance to pay the debts of your mother. You can be the golf Sachin! ¡Sachin! Mom. Son, I'm going to pilgrimage. Beware. Do not skip meals and do not hang out with Maqsood. Take care of yourself too. And do not touch unattended bags. Like me. - Quick, Sulbha. Or late. - Voucher. Beware. Goodbye. - Where will the storm? - Mom goes pilgrimage. That means peace and quiet in the neighborhood. We need to collect money. I have to go to the club to learn golf. Golf? You played one day, and you do not see more than the ball and the hole. Learn the alphabet does not make you a scholar. Forget the golf and we will work. Uncle Kishan ... Who? Old Monk He says he will make me a champion. That says. He never married and want to get yourself a girlfriend. It's what I explained to him, but not listen. Says that if I do case to him, - he will tell Mom what our business. - Damned... How you will tell Mom? I did not shoot him before? Anyway, let no one dies in the neighborhood ago. No. We owe a lot. When Dad died, he took care of me and my mother. - You too? - Yes. What do you mean? - Let's play golf. - What have you said? - Regards. - Regards. - Regards. - Goodbye. What's he doing here, Ali? I asked you why you came into this world? I have come to see the game Ali and understand yours. Ali, outsiders can not play here. But we are not out. We are here. He laughs. Ali, I told you not listen to the old monk. - Let's go back. - Come on. Wait, Ali. Just for my 20 years of service and your game yesterday They have given us permission to play. And permission is for one person. I just remembered a joke. Once a guy brought his friend. But an old humiliates him. He says, "Get out of here". Ali comes to training. Let's go. You know a lot of jokes. What say you I knockout? - Watch this. - No, boss. Ali, red flag. There. You always the red flag no matter where the ball is. - Yesterday you gave. - It's over. Or. If you have come because You think I'll tell your mother about your illegal business, You can go! But remember. What? Your future depends on a good shot and a bad decision. Think what you want. The bad decision? Or the good shot? A great shot! But I have not thrown. Talk about him, not you. - Who? - Is Ali. He lives in the next street. Do people in your neighborhood playing golf? No sir. Until two days ago he sold shorts. - But now I do not know. - Do you also play the "Gulf"? No es "golfo", se dice "golf". Sea "golfo" o "golf", the righteous is unknown to me. Hello, Ali. Do you know who it is? Vikram Rathore. Golf champion. How are you Sir? How is it going? Thank you. Today has taught me a good lesson. Do not give out to anyone after becoming champion. Only when you become champion. This is not as easy as selling underwear, you can beg the customer to buy them. This is golf. It is a game rich. A poor like you have to sell a kidney to buy a club. You know what a club? A brat! We are poor. We tear the heart if necessary, a kidney is not that great. If you need it someday, let me know. Another thing. It gives the same play it, the poor earn or learn, never lose. Goodbye. What is this talk about rich and poor? Nobody talks about this already. - Ali, what do you do? - What? It is a golf champion. You look back and he is ahead of you. Yes. Now he is back. Now we are equal. Let's go. Goodbye. Translation and synchronization: FaLhIy76 Uncle, I've learned to play golf. What are you worried now? Ali has learned to play golf, but to be an official golfer, you must participate in the qualifying tournament. And that ... We need money. - How much? - Half a million. Half a million? You know how many zeros are that? With that amount, we can marry several girls in the neighborhood and educate all children. Half a million! Ali, tournament fee, golf equipment, clothing, travel expenses. We need money for that. You can not, not play the tournament. He leads me to a brothel, and then says no girls. Why did not you say so?

And we could stay at a motel. - But then he could not tie. - Flirt? What are you talking about? Do not trust me? I do, but he did not. And I begin to distrust. Ali, first we must consider that half a million rupees. What he spent the money? It does not matter if you spent something on it. Let him enjoy a little before croak. You're right. - What? ¿Croak? - That is... What do you say? Damn rascal! That's why I did not bring it here. You want to do accounts? Voucher. Equipment, clothing, flight, travel, food.

Chief, sell this junk and buy a new car, if not, one day I burn. Stupid, you are also useless. You should also burn? Rogue, cheater, traitor! Fraud. Rascal, would I insult you?

And the engine is broken. That will cost 350 000. The carburetor is clogged. The fan does not work. The brakes do not work. And I found the steering a little ... What is the total cost? Not much, boss. In total, about 1.2 million. Idiot, that car is worth a million and repair costs 1.2 million. - Yeah. - First you brought that old. Then checks. And now this rusty scrap metal. You had to bring 300,000 rupees that man. You could not bring money? - Munna, do not burn the car. - Do not burn yourself! Boss, the jeep is already burning. - dwarf Damn, get lost. - Chief, listen to me. That guy was going to give me 300,000 rupees. But I brought this car is worth a million. It is a benefit of 700,000. Benefit? I'll give you 700,000 kicks. Maqsood. Who did you boss? He fled. Maqsood. What happens there? There are a bunch of idiots. - Where were you? - In Bangalore. ¿Bangalore? I understand that you had gone to Bangkok. It is a place of interest. Why did you go to Bangalore? Ali is pointing at golf. He won the golf tournament. You think you can fool me. Is the neighborhood kid play marbles or golf? I knew you'd say that. Here, read this. "For a virile strength, Meet Dr. Ashok. Near the bus stop, Kandivali West. " Not that. - This. - You could not say it before? I started planning to go to Kandivali. "Local boy wins Ali Golf Tournament. It ranks in the Top 60. " It is the picture of Ali. It's all written here, but I do not think so. Do not you believe it? Play in Mumbai next week. - See for yourself. - I go and see him myself. But the Big Boss will not be happy. We are tightening. - The big boss? - Yes. Our business has fallen a lot extortion. What do I tell them? Now our people are playing. It will kill me. Excuse me, sir. Can I become a selfie with you? - Yeah sure. - Go. Thank my Lord. When people selfies ago, you're a star. But in the old days, Dilip Kumar, Ashok Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, How stars were made without selfies? Ali, a selfie with me too. Please. - Why do you call this unfortunate? - What miserable? He meant famous. I'll be right back. Who? Chief Risk is a dangerous gangster. - Chief, how are you? - It is too high. What do you care? The boss is very close to God. When we die, we will go to heaven. But the boss will not rise much. - Right, boss? - Shut. - You will start the game. - they Have released the coin? Sir, this is not a game of cricket. This is golf. No coin is tossed. You see? So he does all of golf. Damn old, why do not you tell us Why is the earth round? Or why February has only 28 days? And in old movies, why the ghost leaves only when the heroines bathe? And tell me, why children are born nine months? - By sex! - Is going to kill me. The match is about to begin. Come on. Dwarf. What does? Called the Big Boss. Say, boss. Say it! Say! I think there is no coverage. Well, get up, you're like a tower. Say it? Yes Boss? Okay, boss. MUMBAI OPEN RONDA FINAL OPEN FINAL ROUND OF DELHI OPEN FINAL ROUND CHANDIGARH OPEN FINAL ROUND AHMEDABAD HYDERABAD OPEN FINAL ROUND KOLKATA OPEN FINAL ROUND OPEN FINAL ROUND OF CHENNAI PUNE OPEN FINAL ROUND Superb! Yes Boss. I've lost again. The Queen is not my destiny. Boss, your 2500 rupees. Subo 2500 rupees. - What is this? - Losing. What kind of joke is this? Who pays for losing? What if someone does? Why would anyone want to win? Clear. Ali has won every tournament. - It has become a champion. - Y? Everyone thinks it will also win the next championship. What will they think? Ali will win. It's what I'm trying to say. All bet on the victory of Ali. But we bet to lose. Bet? If we win this bet, Maqsood, you earn millions. Millions! DAY 1 Vikram, I think the tournament this year will be tough. Clear. But for the rest, not for me. None of the players can challenge Vikram. And Ali, who has played very well on an ongoing basis? Nobody, and I mean nobody can beat me if I am not myself! As every year, the tournament will win me. Not just anybody. Hello, Ali. Any one? Ali, Vikram says this year will also win. He has not said anything wrong. Someone who has won five years in a row, How you can lose this year? He is a born winner. In fact, you should be called Vikram 'Victor' Rathore. He is a champion. All players have come to lose against him. In fact, they should cancel these tournaments. And send the trophies of the next two years at home. How can you say you lost? Imagine that lost. What's the worst that can happen? He would be humiliated. Lose their dignity. But would still handsome. Her face is pretty, it could be a model. I do not know if I could make movies, because it is more difficult. Or maybe you can make music videos. Class B music videos At least it would not be humiliated. Even if you suffer some humiliation, He lives in a palace. Imagine that you kicked out of his palace. And it stays on the street. You will find any one like me there and if you ask "What are you doing here?", What are you going to tell? So the conclusion is you have a lot to lose and I have nothing. Long live the prince. - Never mind, dear. - Shut! Down pants! It is real? What are you doing here? Get lost! GROUP A Hole 3 HOLE PAR GROUP A - HOLE 18 GROUP B - HOLE 18 I heard a story of a child. About a king whose life was trapped in the body of a parrot. Ali is king and Kishan Lal is the parrot. Cages Kishan Lal, and the king's yours. Maqsood, why did you bring me here? Look, Kishan Lal, inside you will find some girls. Geez, what are you talking about? I'm not that kind of man. You're 60 years old and still single. Every man has needs. You want to be a caddy all your life? - Do not you want to be a daddy? - Do not. - I'm a decent guy. - A boy? You were a kid when Aamir Khan wearing jeans high shot. You know what the midwife said when you were born? "Dear, is a great guy." I'm panicking. - You follow me play. - Voucher. Look for more men. We go to a musical meeting, okay? Enters. Let's go! Go ahead, boy. - Do you believe? - Come on. Let's go. And. DAY 2 The game is about to start Kishan Lal has not arrived. - And do not answer the phone. - There will have an accident. What do you say? It's my caddy. How do I'll play the tournament without him? Do not worry. I'm here. I'll be your caddy. This is golf, not a putiferio, where a girl replaces another. "Yo seré tu caddy". This is a great tournament and Kishan Lal should be here. What was that old? Carry your stuff. Not just his stuff. I knew what club to use what and when to throw. I also chose some things. I will replace you. I think we should wait. We delay it if you hope. As the saying goes: "Something much better ..." "Something something..." - "Less gives a stone." - That. HOLE PAR 1 Good shot. - Wait. - Take this. This stick is not good for this shot. - This stick ... - Is this. - Why have you given me this? - It's good. You should have known that. That was good too. This is good. Let's go. You're confusing me. - Is not that ... - is this. - Is this not confuse me. - right, forward. You've unfocused. See where the ball goes. I told you this stick ... Play Well. Shut. - Play well, Ali. - Shut! What will happen today. Look how he plays. Maqsood. The game is very wrong. Let's play it safe. Give me the iron. Ali, no mistake. Focus on your game. - Insurance? - Clear. Give me the driver. Ten. I can not concentrate. Why do you smile? Let's go. Maqsood, I know what you're doing. I do my job, and you should make yours. It is understood? I told Ali to stay away from Maqsood. But now he told you to stay away from my son. Why did you do it, Maqsood? Because I want to make money, not being a champion like you. What do you get winning? A trophy and some money? Your picture in the paper? And me? How can you forget that play because of me? Kishan Lal and you would have lost hope. I went to Chief Risk for help. Mom, I was with your son when she was sad and crying, not her! I was with him when selling underwear in the sun, not her! I defended him when the boys teased him! Mom, not all poor people have the opportunity to become rich. Today we have the opportunity to earn money! - to lead a good life. - What a good life? Do you know the difference between a good life and an honest life? Come with me. Come! Look! ¡Do! I made a tournament in your name. You have to come. Next Sunday. You'll be ... how do you say? - Chief Guest. - Chief Guest. You must come, brother. Did you hear that? Money does not buy everything, Maqsood. You can buy comfort and luxury with money. But love and respect. Ali achieved something that no one could imagine. He has given them hope. ¡Do! You can not imagine what it did to me! But where were you, man? Where it should not be. - In jail! - In jail? This man will do anything for their benefit. Whatever is! It has tarnished my reputation, Ali. Now I can not look anyone in the face. It's a selfish, Ali! A selfish! I knew that one day do something big, but I never thought I'd fall so low. Come on, mom. DAY 3 GROUP A B GROUP ALI - Hole 12 RATHORE - HOYO 12 Yes! Yes! Ali, listen to me. It is the third day. The first gave in the bushes. The second, in the water. Today it safe. Dale left the tree on the street. It is understood? Well played, Ali. ¿Praise Me? Go. Has anyone ever written to you the text or happened to you alone? Ali, I am a sportsman. And I know that an athlete should respect another. Y? - We had a drink tonight? - A glass? - Tomorrow is the end. - Yes. And if drug in the drink? Why should he? I am talking about myself. See you later. Maqsood, Grand Chief has bet a lot of money for the loss of Ali. Let them understand tonight. Otherwise, my men will explain it very well. I will understand it. A person who offers alcohol is good people. But someone who gets you drunk ... You lose. Whoever wins the championship, it does not matter. Our friendship will remain intact. From now on, we're friends. Health. Vikram. You're my friend. I'm serious. Remember how I said that whoever wins the championship it does not matter? Did not I tell you? - Yeah. - Well, I'll win the championship. Look, brother. I was the champion in the last five years. I want to be six times in a row and beat my own record. But your destiny is in your hands and mine in mine. You're right, my friend. Tomorrow we will know who favors your destination and whose hand ... Bring the car! Try moving your finger. Okay, relax. Aunt, has very injured hand. - You can not play tomorrow. - No, tomorrow will play. It's hard. Of course he plays. For my son it has not been easy to get here.

If you do not leave the field in 10 minutes, You will be disqualified from the tournament. Begins the countdown of my victory. Congratulations on your victory! You can break someone's hand, but do not give me mine. What do you mean? I wanted to do what you do. You want to win this tournament and I want Ali lost. Maqsood did not help. But your motive suited us well. Just a moment. No matter you want bad people, your fate is in God's hands alone. Your desires can not be greater than the will of God. And you, You can break Ali's hand, but not his courage. Maqsood, today you are the caddy. You've learned enough. Sto this. Ahead. HOLE 1 Here, take this. What's happening here? Ten. Good luck, Ali!
