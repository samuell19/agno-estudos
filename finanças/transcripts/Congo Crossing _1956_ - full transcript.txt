Well, David, I didn't expect to see you for another tWO weeks. Hello, dOCtOF. Who is this? Arneau. Fever hit him about a week ago. I don't know what's kept him alive. He'S very SiCk. And I don't have any drugs to help him. The last Shipment again, David, it arrived in Congotanga but never reached me here at the hospital. Well, if he's Strong enough, maybe the fever will burn itself out. You promised me. |Will not die in this devil's land. I'll go back to French priSon and die, but not in Congotanga. we'll leave tomorrow morning. You'll be on that plane, Arneau. We'll get him into the hospital. I'll do What I can. What can l 00? Rittner knows others in the town. There'S no way of fighting them, David. There are 5,000 people in thesejungles Who depend on me. I can't give them medical care Without proper drugs. Leo, I promised you that When the survey at the river was finished l'd help you fight that gang 0f thieves. lcould've finished it this trip but Arneau got the fever. I can't do it alone. it seems we have Similar problems. You're fighting to finish a job, and the both of us trying to do it alone. I Still can't underStand Why the Belgian mining Syndicate wants the Survey. Every curve and Sounding on that river iS on records they had They must have Some reaSon for sending you here, David. lWish they'd let me in on it. But my contract doeSn't Say l have to know what I'm doing. Leo, if I can find Someone tomorrOW in that peSth0le Who needS money badly enough to help me, I'll be able to finish in a couple 01â€˜ weeks. And then we'll do something about your drugS. Well, the next shipment isn't do for another month yet. Until then, prayer alone Will have to do the healing. Hello, Carr. Help me get him into the office. Huh? Hey, how long has he had the fever? Hit him about a week ago. Huh? week ago? See that he getS on the plane, Arragas, Will VOU? All right. Another load or outcasts to join Rittner's hOOdlumS. well, dear people, welcome to the sovereign State Of C0ngotanga. 0h, pleaSe, madam, be comfortable. My name iS Colonel John Miguel Orlando Arragas. lam, by miSfortune, the Minister Of Interior and Chief of Police 0f the mOSt wretcned Strip ofjungle in all West Africa. Now, I am very, very happy to tell you that we 0f modern C0ngotanga love nothing too much aS peace and contentment. But there are thOSe who come to US because they are purSued by the police 0f other countrieS. Oh, we have no extradition laws, So they are Safe. l personally, lshare their delight in freedom. But to leSS, I'm also the custodian of the laW. So, you have to behaVe, my children, or I'll have you Shot. Pompala. Ah, Mr. Carr, SUCh a long three weekS. we have missed you. - Any mail? - No. Pompala, SO good 0f you to return. What's the trouble, Rittner? This dog workS for me. He didn't like your work habit. Then I would like to take him down river. You're a Very emotional man, Mr. Carr. Just nervous for the heat. Pompala, finish your jOb. This way, Ms. Whitman. Oh, you mustn't be frightened, miSS. They're people just like yourself, you see? Even another woman for you to talk over the dainty things to light. How do you d0? An important man, Mr. Rittner, very rich, very powerful. MS. Whitman, I'd like you to meet a gentleman over here. Mr. Carr. You know, we have all kinds 0f people around here. Even an honeSt man. i supposed we're the only American. And there'S another. Oh, What do we do? Form a Club? I wouldn't count on it. Thank you. That's very hospitable. Nothing personal. we just don't run on the same set. Sure. Anyone can see that you're the high class type. They are markS Of my laSt Virtue. What waS your particular fall from valor? Me? I'm just a touriSt. lt'S harmleSS. Nobody answered that door. You are Bart O'Connell? Yes, I remember your neWSpaper pictureS. You got a good memory. You're one Of the no ones? Not exactly. I'm taking the plane out again. Back to that big outside world. There'S no SUCh place. You aren't SO sure 0f it. I've been in this place five yearS, counting and hearing myself sweat. And you had to come in and tell me What a guy i used to be? Man, you shrink in this country. That's the truth. l'm Shorter. An inch Shorter than I was when i came. well, What do you want? My name iS Mannering. I represent a private intereSt. I've been commiSSioned to offer you a SOlid money. A thousand now, twenty thousand more when you perform a certain service. Not to take you out Of here. With this much, I'm sure there are other placeS, Shall we say, a bit more deSirable than Congotanga. What do you want done? A matter 0f assassination. You could have aSked any 0f the otherS. They'd do it for kicks. Who is it? She checked into the hotel today. A woman? Her name is Louise Whitman. Whitman, huh? She l00kS over that You're well informed. it's a prOfeSSional intereSt. She must have got out Of France, wentjump ahead Of this Gendarmes guy'S yacnt Where it happened. Albert he iS a rich man, really lots ofjack, huh? No more questions. I'll be back in the next plane in two weekS. How do you know I'll take the deal? You don't like the deal? I'll be seeing you, Mannering. Come in. Just put it by the bed. Oh, I ordered some ice water. - I thought you-- - There's no ice in Congotanga, Ms. Whitman. SO... you have suffered your first disappOintment. If you pardon me, I'll finish dressing. You'll well, suit yourself. You must be prepared for many disillusions. I lost my illusions when I found out ice cream coneS were hollow. You do not yet understand Where you are, MS. Whitman. Do you know how long it haS been Since we've seen a deSirable woman? suppose we get to the point. And the p0lnt lS that you Will be in perpetual danger unleSS you're Wise enough to choose a protector. Like you for instance? A man Strong enough to cherish at your... softness. The next time you touch me, Mr. Rittner, you're going to get cut. Do you have other questions? As I said, Ms. Whitman. You do not yet appreCiate where you are. My. Don't you l00k nice? Oh, come off it. Why don't you sit down and be gracious? Oh, I suppose I'd have to be grateful for the opportunity. on, is that again? The Situation you're in. Figures you have to choose somebody, Okay. My contempt for the guest of this hotel iS exceeded only by my admiration for your neckline. I hear, Carr, you're alwayS gallant. To the fingertips. I might even offer you a little bit of advice. l'll settle for the drink. First rule around here iS watcn your money. once it'S gone, there'S no way to get it back. once these people are broke, they'll play for your bankroll. Just like home. There's a Dr. Leopold Gorman that runS a hospital in thejungle about halfway down the Rio Morte. He needS help. - Don't we all? - Respect him, lady. He's running that hospital on hope. - You met Rittner yet? - I met him. He takeS hiS cut out Of everything, including some 0f Gorman's drug ShipmentS. I thought that p0liceman ran things. What's his name? C0l. ArragaS. Talk tough enough. He'd like to be tough. Anyway, Gorman's short on everything. He could use an extra pair 0f handS. HOW about it? No, it doesn't figure, not for me. Around here, you either work or rot. l'll be Starting down the river tomorrow. i could drop you Off. Hello, Carr. Louise Whitman, Bart O'Connell. I don't think your friend Will ask me to join you, may l? Please. You've got the wrong place, Mr. O'Connell. it doesn't match your reputation. You're very frank. Oh, I've been taking lessons from the maeStro. Louise iS here to study our quaint customs. O'Connell drops in because Miami is full up thiS season. I've offered him a job, but he's independently wealthy. Now that we've been SO carefully intrOduced, MS. Whitman, have you had our local tour? Just the lecture. Would you like to look? Oh, WOUId you excuse US? Be my guest. once, there waS a caSino here. Before that, a State market. Now the hotel. Tell me about David Carr. He's an engineer working here. He's under contract to a Belgian mining syndicate. lntereSted? Just in paSSing. I'm getting out Of here on the neXt plane. Gee, i made a miStake. lgueSS i figured a tropic paradise With tea danceS by the pool and I don't know, but I certainly didn't bargain for this. That plane flies to Khartoum. In two weeks, the pOlice there Will have a report on you. They'll be waiting. Give them time to forget. How long? Two, three years if you're lucky. What? The man you killed, were you in love With him? it's over there. In that crucifix? Relics, MS. Whitman. Relics are for lOSt glory. Now, they only emphasize our own putative. once, great dreamS were dreams you made, but then a dream waS broken, found themselves forgotten, so did I. For us, there'S nothing but the ruins and an illusion, illusion to escape. Haven't deprived your walk, Ms. Whitman, huh? NO, l wasjust going. I'm very tired. Good night. Mr. Carr aSked me to give you this. Oh, thank you very much. Hey, wait a minute. Maybe that's the reason for them to survey. Come in. Oh. well, are you all right, professor? I got Slugged and rOlled. See who did it? Somebody waiting in my room. When I woke up, my purse was gone. Let's have a lOOk. Does that offer to take me out of here still hold? If you want. Yeah, you're all right, just bruised. Oh, sure, fine. Every dime I own was in that... Wait. You rotten crOOk. Sit down and listen. ltOOk that money When you bounced out With O'Connell. All you had to do is ask for it and grow enough brains not to carry it around With you. You eXpect me to believe that? No. l eXpect you to believe i slugged you. Count it, it'S all there. Thanks, you did me a favor. i guess that doesn't happen much around here. on, I'm sorry about this. I'm not really that tough. I'm taking the boat down to Gorman aS soon aS I find another aSSiStant. The invitation Still goes. What do you get out of it? Will that pay for my boat ride? That's for nothing, and SO iS the boat ride. I'll let you know when we leave. The things we learn about each other. You still looking for a helper? That's rig ht. Well, I'm applying for thejob. Why now? Now, I need the money. You know what it's like down there? on, i can guess. You can't even imagine. Why not SO? GOOd morning. Lovely morning, Mr. Carr. Bart said we were ready to go. You're pretty quick. I said we wouldn't shove Off until I find a helper. Louise. I think the doctor'S hOSpital is such a worthwhile activity. Don't you, Mr. Carr? I've been meaning for ever SO long to help out. Now with Louise going, I thought, well, What a Splendid Opportunity for companionShip. With your permiSSion, Of course. You get your permiSSion from Dr. Gorman. ljust run the boat. Oh yes, yes. Pompala, Who was he, Louise? Hmm? Who waS he? Who? That guy in the Riviera. A man named Howard Sullivan. Boyfriend? Paper said SO. They got pretty lurid about it. "Lurid Playgirl Slays Lurid Playboy on Lurid weekend Cruise." Alberts yacht, do you ever hear Of him? The guy With the gold bed? Gold-plated. He had a lot Of gOld-plated friendS, too. it's quite a party. Well, how did it happen? Say, you don't wanna give me the edge for anything, do you? Maybe i had a reason. How good a reason do i need? You tell me. Maybe i was framed. Would that help? well, i wasn't. When it's hot, drink hot. Tea ? Thank you. Mr. O'Connell? No, l'll skip it. Well, I'm glad those awful StorieS haven't bothered you, my dear. What stories? Why, those people they say i pOisoned. Sugar? No, thanks. l, uh, brought you some help. Louise Whitman, Amelia Abbott? Dr. Gorman. You're more than welcome here. Doctor? Ms. Whitman? You accept us very eaSily, doctor. NO questions, no fearS. Perhaps to the pOlice Of certain countieS, you a re fugitives. I'm a phySiCian, not a pOliceman. Here, only your work is important. And what about Mr. Carr's work? Everyone wonderS What your company had you looking for in this dreadful jungle. I don't know. Same survey waS done years ago. You mean you really don't know why you're out here? I took a job in the Belgian Congo, the mining syndicate sent me to C0ngotanga, I do What I'm told. Like looking for something when you don't even know what it is? That's rig ht. You'll find the night here mOSt pleasant. I advise you not to wander far. lthink I'll take a walk around. lntereSted? No thanks. I think I'll just sit here and feel typically tropical. Are you suggesting I move my hospital? l'm suggesting we move the boundary. The boundary? This iS my survey aS far aS it'S gone. Last night, i found something intereSting. Here's C0ngotanga, Belgian Congo, Congo River, here's our river, the Rio Morte. You tOld me yourself the rainfall around here iS fantaStic. The Morte iS always shifting, all right? It is shifting. i won't know how much until i finish my survey. But the boundary? They get this border by measuring weSt 30 mileS from the meeting Of the two rivers here. Like this. And supposing the two rivers meet here, for inStance. Now measure weSt 30 mileS. Then the new boundary would fall about... here. And all this... would become Belgian COth. Say, I bet its way past your bedtime. If the river haS Shifted far enough, then half Of Congotanga would fall under Belgian contrOl. And the Belgian police, if they'd come in? Just try to keep them out. For years, they've been screaming about a criminal calling me on their doorStep. That's Why the BelgianS kept it a secret even from me. Hmm, there iS something worth doing that, too. CUt out a cancer, help your neighbors, save your hOSpital. Come on, let me see What you got behind your back. Dr. Gorman. Dr. Gorman. Dr. Gorman, take a look at his hand. We'll take care of it With a surgery. Okay, handsome. we'll complete your indoctrination tomorrow. Thank you, doctor. Rittner. Rittner, at the hotel. Rittner? YeS, ma'am. on, money. Here and thiS. Now, he must get the letter before the sun rises. Yes, ma'am. I run all way. All right, go on. GO, go. It's funny. You snip a bandage, make a kid laugh, and suddenly, you feel respectable. Ha, you wanna hear the topper? When I was a kid, i wanted to be a nurse. What got in the way? Well, |... matured ea rly. Had new dreamS Of glory. So I started at the top and worked my way down. Only I took the international route. Big time model, part-time model, no-time model, but a great girl for a party, like that weekend wingding on Alberts yacht and, brother, suddenly you're nowhere. Maybe thiS iS somewhere, here at this hospital. Don't figure it more SOlid than it is, Lou, things can change here, too. Everything changes. Any Of your people have gunS? No, David. She's dead. Leo, you better have your people check outSide. YeS. I heard a Shot, iS everything... Amelia. What about it, O'Connell? You're the only one unaccounted for. wanna take another l00k for the gun? Oh, come on, use your head. lfl wanted to kill her, I would've done it back in town, clean, no fuzz, no bother. Anybody could've been hiding out there. The whole town iS capable Of murder. If you really wanna play cops and robbers, I'll give you my professional opinion. Somebody made a miStake. Amelia was killed and Louise iS roaming in the dark. I think Louise waS the target. - Me? - Did you make any enemieS back at the hotel? on, Rittner, i suppose. The otherS, the way they looked, I don't know. If what Mr. O'Connell's says iS true, then Ms. Whitman is still in danger. well, She can't Sit here waiting to get Shot at again. It's either here, or at the hotel, or she can take her chances down the river with us. it's up to you. Doctor, I've got a question for you. How many times do you have to run away before you're a prOfeSSional coward? Discretion iS alwayS a budget equipment, until it costs too much. Maybe, l'll come back some time, if you let me. Of course, Ms. Whitman. we're set, LeO? You ready? Not really. well, goodbye, Dr. Gorman. Goodbye, Ms. Whitman. on, say, that little boy with an injured hand, maybe he'd like this. Figure a dame like that. Are you in love with her, David? Don't get Clinical on me, doctor, it'S too hot. If you prove the fugitives are in Belgian territory, then She'd be arreSted along with the others. That's rig ht. i can't Change her life for her. Then it would be unkind to offer hope Of happineSS. Unless you plan on playing tenniS, you'd better change your ShortS. I'm perfectly comfortable, thank you. we got insects around here, the experts haven't even heard about it. They're gonna love those legs. David. So, we wait. Wait for what? Not if they'd escaped. Mr. Carr, we want only your maps. David, it's Rittner. Stay down. - What's it all about? - Pompala? You take the boat on, I'll try to get around behind them. Help or not, it'S up to you. You charmed men would all set up shop here. Give me a few minuteS. I'll be back but no guaranteeS. Mind telling me what I got shot for? For being With me. Great little round robin we've got here. Emilia gets Shot for being in my room, we got Shot out for being With you, and nobody knows anything. we know Rittner wanted your map. He wanted me dead. Why? What doeS he got againSt you? When you get back, you can ask him all about it. You wouldn't wanna try to guess why he was still so anxious about those mapS. I wouldn't guess. we'll put aShore and bury him. Pompala. You could've got yourself killed back there helping me. Had to. You're half our army. it's a pretty gruesome thought people trying to kill people and nobody knows why. Yeah, it'S a pretty lousy thought. Beat a drum half the day and they think it makes the world different. well, I've seen worse wayS to get rid Of your personal deVilS. That great magic we've got, little pieceS Of green paper. Everybody thinks that if they get enough of it and the world would be different. Only the trick never works. Works fine, Lou, if you're a good enough magician. And that's how come you're living in a penthouse at the Ritz. Say, Bart, why did you hire on with David? Money. Enough to make it worthwhile? I thought SO When i Started. Back at the hotel, you think you'd do anything to have enough money to escape. And now? Now, it isn't like that. Well, maybe we'll find a pot full Of diamondS at the end of the river and we'll all live happily ever after. No, only Carr WOUId. Look, I'm only kidding. Well, I'm not. There's something worth having down there. Rittner doesn't know it and neither iS Carr. - we're the fOOlS. - But you'r wrong, Bart, he does his job. And he doesn't know Why he'S mapping this river or What he'S looking for? He doesn't know why Rittner wanted his maps All right, you guess. Whatever there iS down there can save me. Why shouldn't we take our Share? I need money, Louise, you don't know how bad I need it. You could help me. l'm sorry, Ba rt. Don't mix yourself up with any fancy ideas. All that matterS here iS What you can touch and take. That's all that keepS you alive. we're out of the shallows. Okay. What'S the matter? Tsetse flieS, breeding ground isjust ahead. we bundle these netS till we pass the Club You wouldn't be intereSted. l'm fascinated. well, don't waSte your enthusiasm. All you got paid for is holding the rod. Better get under the netS. My union says i got to know What l'm working for. At the end Of the river. Then l'm writing a new deal, one half the risk, take half of the profit, that's the way I see it. I'll take it up with the board Of directorS. Ba rt. What is it, Carr? What's down there? well, What about it, partner? What are we in business for? You've got about one minute before tsetse flies get. They'll blow you up like a balloon. - You'll die Of screaming. - I wouldn't wanna die gueSSing. Louise, get under the netS. This is what you wanted to see. Take a look at it. Whatever we find, O'Connell, you'll get your Share. We'll be back for dinner, duchess, don't get lonesome. I think I'll have the girls then for 'Bridge'. You know What you're gonna dO? You're gonna Sit here and wonder about Carr and me, Whether we're both be coming back, what it would be like With jUSt you and him orjust US? Every day, you're gonna wonder. Pompala, if anything Should happen to me, take thiS to Dr. Gorman. Tell no one else and keep it safe. You underStand? Dr. Gorman? That's right. I'll see ifl can get us some freSh meat for dinner. Yeah, do that. we'll celebrate at the end of the river. You'll be out Of thiS soon. Sure. Back to town. Different game, same OddS. Take whatever chance you've got with the French police. Get out Of C0ngotanga. Uh-Uh. I hate to see lovely ladies work. l'm the independent type. Wa te r. Oh. Get back to the tent. we can'tjust leave him there. Carr's been digging our graves every foot of the way. Get inside. Some intuition you got. Two to choose from and l'm the boogeyman. well, you liSten to me. You ought to be dead by now. lcould've killed you for money, 20,000 dollars' worth. That Mannering guy on the plane threw in to make me a deal only I didn't do it, did I? That's a lot Of caSh I gave up for you. lcould've killed you. Maybe i Should'Ve. But i need you to finish this survey and you're gonna finish it with me. NOW there'S only one rifle left that'll shoot. From here on end it'll be pointed at you, if you get out of line. I'll leave your corpse here for thejungle antS. i read the note, Carr. You'll have to watch me day and night and i won't do a thing but wait for you to keel over all by yourself. - David? - Yeah. O'Connell tOld me something. He said somebody hired him to kill me. What? Yup. CaSh on the barrelhead. Produce one body Of Louise Whitman and collect accordingly. Why? - Who would-- - Oh, I can guess. Anyway, he changed hiS mind, you got to give the girl confidence. Dead, l'm worth 20,000 to him. Alive, in the flesh, l'm a more Valuable item. i don't suppose you're ready to make a bid. we could make the paymentS easy. You have to keep thiS for practically nothing. on, David. Well, with me, you can only get hurt. we could have a great time going for each other. Don't think I wouldn't enjoy it. But the way thingS are we don't miX SO good, right people, wrong place. I know I love you. L00k. The river haS changed itS course. A lot of things changed with it. What does that have to do with us? My map Will show that some Of C0ngotanga shifted into the Belgium Congo, the town, everybody in it. The Belgian Police. They'll come all right. All this time, this is what you've been doing knowing what it would mean to me. Since we left Gorman'S. Why? To help Gorman do a decenthb, knock that town out Of business, and save hiS hospital. Why did it have to be you? He's SiCk, Lou, real SiCk. Finally made it, finished the survey, make your way out Of C0ngotanga, you go together. David, on. He'll die if he doesn't get to the hospital. Bart, help me, I'll do anything you want just help me. I followed him this far for nothing, now l'm going back alone, and collect my pay for a jOb i haven't done. Then l'm gonna get on that plane and Start living again. If you could get out Of C0ngotanga, get enough money, you wouldn't care about David, or me, or the mapS, right? That's right. Here, l'Ve got money, almost $9,000, enough to get you anywhere. Just help me get him to Dr. Gorman. So I take it. How do you know I Still won't earn my 20 grand? Suppose we try and Spend thiS together, you and me. I said anything you want. You made a deal, Lou. Dr. Gorman. Rittner. There must be something in one Of these bOOkS that tell us what to do. on, Dr. Gorman. - David where is he? - He's on the boat SiCk and unconscious. we brought him to you aS faSt aS we could. His crisis iS Closed. one more day Of delay and-- Now, he'll be all right? I don't have many tOOlS. What hit you doctor? They came from the town. i don't know how many there were. It's your hospital, why? Because the good doctor knows a bout the river. l escaped to thejungle, my friends helped me. we came back every day waiting for you. The river up there is being watched. The village isjust a few mileS from here, we're taking him there. SO, you have your proof? Now l'm wondering if you have the right to use it againSt MS. Whitman. She's still Sleeping? She never Closed eyes until you opened yourS. Even then she-- My, you're really back, aren't you? Guaranteed, not to SpOil, - all l'm-- - Uh-uh. If you try to move, you'll fall apart. You need to reSt, you underStand? Pure cryStal. Oh... good for you. Price Of thiS came pretty high, I wouldn't toss it around. You helped get it thiS far that makes you a full partner. I'll be leaving before the Belgium police get here. And just for the record, I didn't kill anyone. What? Oh, the neWSpaperS had all the rest of it right. A man was killed only Vivian did it, that's an educated guess. And it waS a frame? Vivian offered me $10,000 cash and a plane ticket to C0ngotanga and 2,000 a month aS long i Stay here. All l have to do iS disappear. That way, I kind of framed myself. lam frightened and i wasn't eXactly proud of my life the way it waS. It sounded like a good propOSition to a guy down on a lUCK. Why didn't you tell me? lt'S part Of the deal not to tell anybody anything. And later on, I figured you'd have to take me for what i was. i guess you did When you gave me thiS. Only it's a little late. No. Not if we go back together without handcuffs. - David-- - Lay it out for the police. David, there'S something else. Uh-uh, ladieS never tell and gentlemen can only guess. Your rights ran out on you, Carr, meet the new owner. David, it isn't what-- Ah, go on and get out. Now, cards do change. Hello. i remember you. HOW'S your hand, huh? Oh, it's all healed, that's good. Well, it is-- it'S been fun. I've been thinking I've had a few years to COOl Off around here. You're still a hot item with the police. Sorry to disappoint you dOll, but I got to go alone. Louise. You shouldn't be up. Good day to you people. Good day. very happy to see you. No, l-- l'm terribly unhappy. You've given me a very difficult game Mr. Carr. My men searching for you, Carl Rittner waiting for you, it waS a question Who getS you firSt, but... you see, I won. You're welcome here Colonel, it isn't necessary to hOld us at gunpOint. l'm very sorry, Doctor, but that's who am |? l'm only the servant of the state. l'm in charge with the function to preserve the status Of C0ngotanga, WhiCh I agree, we all despised boldly but, alaS, it'S all we've got. Please, Mr. Carr, the maps. Sorry, Arra ga S, no deal. No deal? In the name Of my country, I command you to give me the maps. COl. ArragaS. Silence. This man haS been healed. He has? You. You Mr. O'Connell, you give me the maps. ljust carried the rug. Sorry, MS. Whitman, my Sincere regretS. Dear COlonel, take nothing of it. Thank you. The plane comes in tomorrow. we wanna get out on it. You dO? Loo k, M r. Ca rr, l'm a tired man, lam. How can I permit SUCh a monStrous thing to happen, I cannot permit you to turn my C0ngotanga over to the Belgians, l have to demand cooperation. If not? Not? If not? And you forced me, you underStand? You forced me, Iâ€œ well, l have to make it hard for you to leave the country. Colonel ArragaS, we're going to that plane. You are? You're a pOliceman, an Officer, and you deny us your protection? NO, you forced me. If we go back there alone Rittner's gang Will Shoot us - in the StreetS. - Oh, yes. You want it that way? NO, but how can I contrOl that these gang with my handful of soldiers, huh? All right. l'm still the law around here. Tomorrow then we leave. Today I say thiS, tomorrow I may promise nothing. Ah! The delights of a motorized vehicle. Well, now we can drive into town. This could take us right to the plane. ArragaS? It could. Well, how about it?
