I'm going to get a drink! Good evening. Good evening. - You here alone? - With friends. So why aren't you dancing? Why aren't you? Vika? Vika! I need money. What else is new? You got back late. Night shift. - Get some onions, I'll make soup. - Okay. It's gross here, there's bacteria everywhere. Send it to the lab. Someone just threw up in the corridor. I saw. You've recovered from last night, I see. Tea? No sugar? - No. - Good for you. Can I come in? Oh, who's come to see me? Here. If I were just a little younger… How are you? - Your kids came today? - They came. Half an hour and they were gone. They left this here. Take some. I will. Did you talk to the doctor? He said they'll release me this afternoon. I'll remind him, they always forget. What about the chocolate? Thanks. It's a bribe. Shh! - We'll smoke a bit and leave. - Let's see after this puff. Here. - Where's the light? - You have it. You're such a retard. Shut up. No problem. - Hi. May I? - Sure. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, it's not a hookah, you know. - Vika's also a skater. - Really? Sort of. - Want something to drink? - Yeah, why not? - How are you? - Good. Thursday? - Hello? - I'm in ER. Are you for real? I don't know why they brought me here. Natalie was just hysterical. Natalie, can you wait outside for a moment? Sure. What? You can't drink with your medication, you get that? I'm fine. Losing consciousness seems fine to you? Did you have any cramps? No. - Good morning. - Good morning, Rose. Your hair looks nice like this. She cut it for me yesterday. Asia… Her cooking's really spicy. - Did you tell her? - Yes. I don't really like spicy food. I'll tell her again. - Just one more minute, okay? - No problem. That's it. Why aren't you a nurse? I didn't finish high school. But I will. Some day. - You'll be a very good nurse. - Thanks. I have to make a phone call. You'll stay here? No problem. - How do you feel? - Great. I'll be back late. Call if you need anything. Bye. Bye. Don't worry, he's definitely there. Kobi said so. I need to get back early. My mum's pissed off. She's not home anyway, is she? He asked about you. - Who? - Who? No… - Yo! - It's my beer, man. You spilled the whole bottle. I'm getting something to drink. Anybody want anything? No one will sell to you now. We'll see. I have vodka at home. Let's go. It's been a long time. Too long. I thought you were sick of me. A little. What a day. You working tomorrow morning? Yes. We have extra training twice a month. Nice. Waste of time. The morning traffic is impossible. You'll survive. How are you? Fine. How's Vika? Also fine. Getting chilly, isn't it? Yeah. Your house is so Russian. There's only cognac. Want some? Only from my mouth. Wait, wait. Enough with the games. I know you want it. What's up with you? What is it? You're a little girl, huh? No I'm not. So show me. Forget it, I'm not into virgins anyway. I'm home! Vik, don't finish all the hot water. Vika! Vika! What's the matter? Vika, are you in pain? - Does anything hurt? - No, it doesn't hurt. - Drink. - No. Drink, drink, drink. Want to tell me what happened? No. Try to sleep, you need the rest. It always stinks here. Come on, we're late. Now push against my hands. As hard as you can. That's my hardest. Okay. Like this. Pull my hands. Excellent. You're strong. Other hand. Lie down. Look, she's young. In most cases, that means slow progress. But there are no absolute rules. I can only speculate, everything else is… Asia… From what I can see, her motor skills are deteriorating. It could take years before her breathing is affected, but unfortunately it could happen much sooner. We'll get a second opinion, there are always options. Vika, come on, get up. I'm not going. I've already taken the day off. Later. We have a bus in an hour. Here. It's nice here. Cold. It's colder in Jerusalem. At least not everyone there is old. Well, are you coming? Smile a little! I spent half my salary on this. Come on, you spoiled kid! Come on, give it a chance. - Want something to drink? - A Screwdriver. Don't get excited, it's only juice. Want to dance? No way. Fine. You left so soon. Your sister? What do you think? You look alike. Want a chaser? Don't even think about it. She's not old enough. Next time. - Cheers. - Cheers. Come to the bar later, I'll treat you. Sure, we will. I'll be there. - A little young for you, isn't he? - I thought of him for you. - I'm going to the room. - Come on, I was just joking. Why are you like that? Like what? That. I was just joking around. I'm going to die a virgin. No, you're not. You know, what they have between their legs, it's not that great. Really, the only thing I ever got from a man is you. When you were a baby, we used to sleep together in bed. I would wake up in a panic, afraid I had squashed you. But you slept peacefully. Nothing bothered you. But putting you to sleep, that was awful. You screeched like a goat. The only thing that put you to sleep was my singing. That's the truth. No, stop it… Stop, enough! Enough, please. I told you, I can't. - How long will it take? - I don't know. A few months maybe. There's this guy from Bulldog's gang. I think he's really into me. Look. Cute. He has a tattoo of wings on his back. He looks like an angel. So maybe you aren't right for each other. Too bad you don't come to the skatepark anymore. There are some new guys, really talented. He's not worth it. He's such an asshole. Where were you? Out. I phoned you maybe twenty times. I didn't notice. Were you drinking? - No. - You want another attack? To be sent to the emergency room again? Not to be able to stand up? What do you want? I sit here and worry about you, okay? Your problem. I work from morning till night, to come home and see your dissatisfied face. Nothing is good enough for you, no matter what I do. Valentina, afterwards we'll put on cream. - I can't remember… - What? The words to the song. - Can you? - I don't know. You okay? Yeah. - Why? - You're acting strange. Not easy, huh? Life? Yeah… Listen, I have this patient… I don't know if you've met him. He came in last week after leg surgery. He has this funny name… - Tusik. - That's it, Tusik. He tells me, his whole life he was healthy, but he suffered because his wife made him miserable. She drove him crazy till she died. And now he's in the hospital with no one to take care of him. I told him, it's time to find a new woman. He said it's too late to drink when the kidneys don't function. He died yesterday. Really? Listen… I've wanted to, for a long time. Come on, Stas. - It can't be easy now. - We manage. Take it. Take it. Where's Vika? She didn't feel well so she called me. You didn't answer. I have a daughter in the Philippines. Same age, maybe a little younger. I haven't seen her for five years. She's grown up by now. - How old are you? - Forty-five in July. I'm thirty-five. I was very young when I had Vika. I thought it would be easier. I thought I would be better. I remembered it! Vika! Vika, what's the matter? Vika, breathe, breathe. Slowly, slowly, breathe. Close your eyes. Remember when you were little, you'd come to work with me? On the way home, we'd pass by the bakery. Down there, on the street near the post office. They had a machine that made pita bread on a conveyor belt, and you loved watching them come out, one by one. One by one, moving down the line, remember? I was afraid they'd think I starved you. But you loved it so much. One pita, then another one. Another and another. They never stopped coming out. Sometimes I'd buy something just so you could stand and watch, because it soothed you so. Slowly, slowly. Don't rush, Vika. Take a breath. Better now. Right, Vik? I'm sorry, Asia. If I reduce your workload, I'll have to take on someone else. Okay. Divide your hours among the other nurses, work it out. Okay. I was sorry to hear about your daughter. I hope she'll be all right. God willing. Thank you. So that's why you're always at work. Which one, the blond? He looks like a show-off. So? - How did I get such a daughter? - Look who's talking. I know your taste. How would you know my taste? From that dumb show you watch after your night shifts. That's just television. Fine. So who was your first? Your father. And how was it, the first time? Victoria, what's with all the questions? I wanted to get it over with, to know what everyone talked about. So it happened really fast. Afterwards it became nice. Nice… It's boring here. It's not for much longer. Why don't you invite Natalie to hang out with you? Want something from the machine? A coke maybe? Okay. - Sorry. - It's okay. - Is everything all right? - One day at a time. How's Vika? She's still in the ward. But she's a strong girl. What are your plans this week? I don't know yet, okay? We'll see. Asinka… Asinka, for a few days now I've been asking for you, but here they don't listen. They listen, it's just that I wasn't here. How are you? How do you feel? Well, you know, when you're old, something always hurts. With me, everything hurts. I'm old. - At least you're still smiling. - What else can I do? What about you? Just fine. How's your daughter? You have a daughter, don't you? Yes, a daughter. Has she finished school? Not yet. Soon. Good. It's important. Are you with me next shift? I'll try to be. Try to be. - There's no other way. - You'll kill me. - I'm trying to help you. - Go away. So you won't have to get up to pee. You could fall. You can't go by yourself, you understand? Leave me alone! - No… - Mrs Levy… Spread your legs, please. - No… No! No! - It'll be over soon. No! - Let me do my job! - Leave me alone! - Spread your legs, please! - Asia… - It's all right. - Enough… It's all right, it's all right. - Hello? - Stas? What's the matter? Nothing, I'm on the ward, and… I don't know. I don't know. Yes, I'm with you. What's the problem? - Who is it? - Go back to sleep, honey, it's work. Sorry. I have to hang up. See you on the ward. See you. - Hi. - Hey. - You okay? - Yes, yes. - Aren't you going home? - No. My daughter's sick. Yes, I heard. She's in the hospital, so I'm here. I'm sorry. So am I. You want some coffee? I'll make you one. No. Thanks, it's okay. - How many shifts do you do a week? - Why? I just thought maybe, sometimes… I'm going to need help with my daughter. I can pay, too. Not much, but still… I'd be happy to. - Really? - Of course. Thank you. I'll take her. - I'll go and get the stuff. - Yes, yes. What's that smell? Even our house smells like death. Shut up already. - Shit. - What is it? The fridge is dead. It's about time. Watch it. No problem. - No. No… - Come on. - Yes, yes, yes. - Yuck! Want some help? No, it's fine. What's that tattoo? It's a lotus. - Lotus? - I like flowers. - Is Gabi an Arab name? - Vika… It's short for Jaber. - Will you let me help you? - No. Great pizza. Anyone want tea? Me. So you work together? Yes. Does she give you hell, too? Sometimes. I'm sorry, I totally forgot. I'll come in and register, okay? - And what about next week's shift? - I don't know yet. I'll check. - This goes to the trash? - What? - The old one to the trash? - Yes, yes. - Asinka, what will we do with you? - Things can only get better. Isn't that what people say? Good song, huh? Yeah. I hate my hands. Why? They're too big, like a boy's. No way. See? Same size. Hey. - How's everything? - Fine. - Sorry I'm late. - It's fine, we started a movie. - What movie? - You won't like it. - Lots of blood? - Tons. - I guess I'll get moving. - What about the end? You can stay if you want. I want a cigarette. Two puffs. You have trouble breathing as it is. There's a pack in my underwear drawer. Since when do you smoke? Since before I even imagined you. Did you imagine me at all? From your kicks, I thought you'd have your father's personality. And don't I? Have his personality? There's no mistaking, you're all mine. Do you remember him? Before we left for Israel, he came to sign that he agreed you could go. He didn't want to sign. But he didn't want to be a father either. He didn't want anything. - Why? - Enough, Vika. - I'm going to die anyway. - You know I hate it when you say that. When I was little, I'd stand at the mirror for hours making faces… to see if I looked like you. Once you got so mad at me for wearing your earrings. Want me to make you up a bit? Just a little. That must be Gabi. Take it off. - Why? It suits you. - No, I don't want it, take it off. Okay, in a second, I'll open the door. - You're a little early. - Really? I'll get her in a second, okay? Well? Are you sure? - It's a shame. - Go on. Since when do you wear earrings? Don't know, for a while. Suits you. Thanks. So what are we doing today? - Whatever you feel like. - Want to go out? Yes. - I left everything in the kitchen. - No problem. - Bye. - Bye. - Good evening. - Good evening. We'll check your blood pressure. Put your hand here. How's everything? Just fine. She fell asleep easily tonight. Great, thank you. No problem. We had fun. Would you like a drink? Okay. Cheers. Cheers. How was your shift? Long. Vika likes it when you come. I'm happy to come. Really, it's good for her. She won't let any of her friends come here. Do you have a girlfriend? No. Why do you ask? There are things I can't give her, things I'd like her to have. You know she likes you. I never thought of it like that. I know my daughter. She doesn't want to die a virgin. - Do you have any brothers? - Four. Wow. - Are you close? - Used to be. What happened? They all got married. Don't you want to get married? I don't know. My parents want me to. Will you invite me to your wedding? Sure. Thanks. What? What? I don't know… You're acting weird today. Does that feel good? Yes. Stop. Why? I don't need anyone's pity. Sorry. - Hi. - Hey. How's it going? A drink? No. I have to get going. Okay. What about next week? They've given me a lot of shifts. It's kind of a full week. Okay, we'll manage. Is everything okay? Yes. I'm just tired. Okay. Thank you. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. Goodnight. You're sure? Say when. Now. How's Vika? Fine. She's fine. Gabi… I've been wanting to tell you for a long time, I'm sorry. It's okay. Hi, Mama. How are you? I'm fine. - What are you doing? - Nothing much, watching TV. Anything interesting? Amazing stuff. - Is Rose there? - Yes. Valentina? More or less. I'll be back soon. I'm fine. Don't worry. Mama? I love you. Me too. So much. Me too. Bye. Mama. Mama! What's wrong? What's wrong? I can hardly breathe. - I'm calling. - No. No, no, no. Vika… Not now. - Mama… - Not now. I can't. You can. You can. Are you sure? My daughter. This won't hurt. Close your eyes.
