[adventurous music] - [clicking] - [beeping] - [Anna] Dad? - [Harry] Yes, Anna? - [Anna] Can you tell me a scary story? [thunder cracks] - Once upon a time, there was a little girl called... Anna. And she lived in a big house in the countryside. One dark and very creepy night, she was asleep in bed. All of a sudden, she woke up. From downstairs, she heard a noise, the floorboards creaking. Creak, creak, creak. And then a voice began talking. "Anna! "Anna! I'm coming to get you." Then silence. - What happened? - Beneath the blanket, Anna heard breathing. [gasping sounds] She felt the thing moving closer. Long fingers on the blanket. And when Anna thought she couldn't take anymore, the voice said... "I'm right here, "and I've... got you!" - [Anna screams] [both laugh] That was a good one. - Okay you, time to sleep. Nana's going to bed too, so no wandering around, okay? [thunder cracks] - Okay. [smooch] - Lights on or off? - On. - Sleep tight. - Don't let the bed bugs bite. - [chuckles] - [thunder rumbling] - [high pitched ringing] [thunder crack] [rain patting down] [distant chair skids] - [door creaks open] - [ghostly hiss] - Dad?

Thank you. - I so enjoyed his visits. Your nan loved him being here. Such a lovely, lovely guy. - Yeah, he really was. - How was the journey? - Yeah, lovely, fine, yeah. - Oh, good. - Wow, this place never changes. - I know. I know. [chuckles] Well, she's so excited to see you. Lucy. Lucy darling, look who I've got here. - Hey, Nan. - Maggie? - No, it's-it's Anna, sweetheart. It's Anna, your gorgeous granddaughter. - Anna? - That's right, darling. I'll go put the kettle on and give you a chance to catch up. - Hi, Nan. [clock ticking] - Is Maggie here, too? - No. Maggie's not here. It's just me. - That's a shame. - I'm here to look after you. - Hmm. - Bet you need that after your long drive. You must try not to take it personally, Anna. - Hmm. She doesn't even remember me. - [sighs] It's just that, sometimes she's lost in the fog and sometimes she's finds her way out, but she's still the same person you grew up loving. She's so happy you're here. - Hmm. Hmm. [deep sigh] Strange being back. I have so many memories tied to this house.

Five... - [leaves rustling] - [wind howling] - [sighs] [eerie hissing] [ghostly laughing] - It's really good you're here.

Night. - Get home safe. - Yeah. [door clicks shut] [wind chime jingles] - You look just like your father. Same eyes. You've got Harry's eyes. - Have I? - Where is Harry? Will he be staying here, too? - No, Nan. He's not with us anymore. - Where did he go? - He's gone. Dad... Harry died, Nan. - Yes. No. Of course. I knew that, I knew that. Such a shame. Lovely man. Hm. He used to dance with me, insisted on it. He knew how much I enjoy dancing. Lovely man. - Hmm. He was. - I remember the wedding. Happiest day of Maggie's life. Oh, they loved each other so much. - Do you remember much about Maggie? - She loved your father, loved him with all her heart. My Maggie. How happy she was. Harry danced with me at the wedding. He was always playing the same song. Erm, what was it? He played it all the time. I can hear it now. Ooh... I can hear it now. Erm, what was it called? Everyone knew it was Harry's song. We danced to it together. - Nan, it's alright. - What was it? What was it? - Nan, it's okay. Nan. Nan. Nan. - What was it? What was it? - It's okay, it's okay. Nan! I know the song, I know the song.

Hey, buddy. - He won't talk to anyone else but me. Very rude. I told him, I said, "That's rude." - [Karen] That's very rude. - Morning, Nan. - I didn't know. I would've stopped it. Always at night, creeping around, hidden in the shadows. - Oh yeah. [click] [click] [static buzzing] [ghostly hissing] - It's good to get out the house for a bit. What do you reckon, Nan? Do you remember we used to pick the fruit off the trees? - I'm not supposed to be out here. - Yeah, course you are, Nan, it's your garden. - Oh, sweet birdies. - Yeah, they're lovely. - They fly wherever they want. Free to see everything. - Yeah, they do. - Little birds. - Lovely. Alright, come on. - Maggie loved this garden. She used to play hopscotch just over there. Drew on the stones with chalk. - What was she like? My mother? - My sweet Maggie. She loved your father. She would've loved you even more. When she was ten or maybe eleven... She tried to run away. She was gone for a day or two, I was worried sick. William found her, hiding in the orchard. She'd been eating the fruit. William adores her. - Nan. Grandad, he's-- - I wish he'd visit more often but he's a very busy man. Keeps an eye on the house, though. I'm sure he'll be back soon. - Nan. Grandad, he's... He died. Long time ago. Just after mum, when I was born. You remember. - He loved her. We both did. I'm not supposed to talk about it. - Why? - Little birds see everything. Oh... oh... oh... - What is it, Nan? - Look. - There's nothing there, Nan. - [gasping] - Let me get you back inside, okay.

Leave her alone. - Ah, bloody thing. - You didn't hear her? - Hear what? Anna, what's happening? - [panting] - What's happening? - I heard her talking. - Well, she does talk to herself sometimes. - No, I mean there was someone in here with her. I heard another voice, Karen. Excuse me. So you didn't hear anything? - Well no, I mean I was hoovering, I was trying to hoover. - I just, I don't understand, I heard another voice on the receiver, I know I did. - Maybe it picked up a radio station or something. I mean, that thing's got to be as old as the house, I'm surprised it works at all. - Yeah, maybe. I-- - And you know, it might sound silly, but the first few days in this house are bound to be muddling. Your gran's symptoms can really mess with your head. - Yeah. - [chuckles] Look at you you're freezing. - Yeah. - Go and get warm and dry, darling. - [Anna chuckles] - [door thuds] - [ominous music] [Anna] So sudden. At least it felt sudden. But I wasn't ready to lose Dad you know? - Yeah, I know. I don't think you can ever really be ready. Both my parents faded slowly so I had ages to prepare, but it's still devastating when they die. - When I was about twelve or thirteen I had this pet goldfish. I begged Dad for weeks to get one and finally he gave in. I called him Nibbles, because he used to eat the food out of my hand. One day I came home and Nibbles just seemed strange. My-- A goldfish. It was a goldfish, but something just seemed different. Well, a couple of months ago, about a week before Dad passed, he told me that one day whilst I was at school, Nibbles had died. He found him floating at the top of the tank, but instead of telling me, he went out and bought another fish, buried Nibbles in the back garden, covered up his death and kept it a secret from me for over twenty years. Because he knew how devastated I would've been. - Your gran talks about your dad all the time, your mum too, actually. - She keeps mistaking me for her which is weird. Knowing that my life caused her death has always kind of haunted me really. - No, Anna, no. You can't, you can't think of it like that. - It's hard not to, though really. - From what your gran says to me, you know, your mum and dad, they wanted you more than anything else in the world. - Yeah. [glass ringing] [glass ringing] - Isn't that amazing? [ringing continues] - Whenever I hear that sound it sends a shiver down my spine. Makes me think that Dad is still watching over me. Silly, I know. - Not silly. You must be still just awash with grief and there's no deadline for that. - I just feel really lost without him, you know? Do you believe in life after death-- - [vacuum whirring] - [both scream] [both laughing] - Ah! Uh! Beast! Oh, this house will be the death of me. - [laughs] - More wine, right now. Oh, wow.

But what you've got to remember, is that most of the time she's kind of in a world of her own, you know, and what seems like weird behavior to us is perfectly normal to her and if we try to correct it or question her, it's like saying to her that everything she knows is a lie. - I just don't want to be in this house. - No. - I've never liked it and I don't even know why. [sighs] I need to be here for Nan. I want to keep her safe and I love her so much, and I don't-- - Do you want me to stay tonight? Would that be a thing? - Oh god, would you? - Yes.

Just like her mother. - I remember that rope swing in the garden. - Your father climbed to the very top of that tree so you could have a swing in the garden. Up and up he went, until I could hardly see him. I was terrified he was going to fall. You were the apple of his eye. He would've done anything for you. So innocent.

I don't know, it must be twenty years. - I'm sorry I haven't been over to say hello. - It's not a sin to be busy. How's your grandmother? - Yeah, she's, erm, managing. That's why I'm back to help look after her. Although I don't know how much I'm actually helping. - I'm sure she's very happy to have you here. Spending time with loved ones is always a blessing, especially as we get older. At least your mother is always nearby. I imagine Lucy finds comfort in that. And your grandfather, too. I'm sure William is looking over the house, despite the circumstances. - Circumstances? - That he could see no other way. Such a tragedy. - What do you mean? - Well, I thought... It's not my place. - No, please. - Your grandfather... took his own life. - No. No, he didn't. - I'm so sorry, Anna. I presumed you knew. - But that's not true. He... he died from a heart attack from the stress of my mother's death. I think William was so overcome with sadness that he felt there was no other choice. You mother's death was too much for him.

He... he... hurt our little girl. [footsteps thumping] I didn't know. I didn't know until it was too late. I never would've let him hurt my Maggie.

[labored steps] [thud] - [groaning] [engine starting] - He got drunk and killed himself after Maggie's funeral, because he was a coward. [engine humming] [music box jingle] - [coughing] [coughing, gasping] - William destroyed our family. [sobbing] - Nan. [somber piano music] - "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me." We are all born with the capacity to sin, but each one of us is ultimately responsible for our own sins and for the choices we make. God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." "And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, "the birds of the heavens, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." Dominion, an interesting word... power and control, the authority to rule over. Dominion implies ownership, the power to impose our will, to exploit for self-serving desires. It is none of these things. Having dominion over something is a grave responsibility, the responsibility not to impose our power, but to allow all living things the choice to be good. What makes us human is not being good, but choosing to be good. Choosing to reject evil and repent our sins. Choosing wisdom over fear, love over hate, because through wisdom and love all things are possible. When we recognize our sins and repent, only then are we free to move forward, be at peace, and live in the light of God's love.
