Don't change hands. What's his name? Alain. He's my son. How old is he? 28 april 1930. Alger. Happy childhood. Brilliant studies. This little movie is somewhat harmless. I don't know what they want from me. Alain is not in peril. From time to time he runs away from home. And then he comes back to his crib. -2000 francs a day plus expenses. -Do you want an advance? No. I'm trusting you. -I know you're solvent. -What do you know about me? What everybody knows. Your newspaper is a big seller. You've started a successful political career. A ministry soon? Tomorrow precisely. But enough with that. It's getting late. I need more time to check files. It's no use. I'm the heiress of a wealthy flemish dynasty. I'm born in North Africa at my uncle's house. I lived there until I married Commanding Officer Bourgeois in 1950. I left him in 1960. During the OAS rebellion in Algeria. I didn't agree with their ideals. I escaped with Alain. Look at this room. I've put it up for him but he's never here. My husband, Michel, was killed in a military attack. Don't you take notes? Anyway, enough with me. There's nothing else to add. I don't care about the person who sent me this filthy movie. I'm OK to pay but I want all the material. Negatives, originals, pictures if there's any. Do you have an idea? Of course. They want me to get in touch at the Shangai Lily's at 11 PM. It's a club, of a certain kind, living on drugs or prostitution. It's not very clear. I have nothing to do in such a sordid place. You will substitute for me. And hear about this... A black rose will be on your table. It's the recognition signal. Photo souvenir? Can I? You shouldn't take so much risks. You know it's my passion. Tightrope walker? What do I serve? Vladimir. Roses are fragile. Especially black ones. Beauty is always fragile. Do you like flowers? Don't say no. You smiled. I like this place. There are always flowers on the table. It's like a recognition signal. You catch me? No? Yes? My favorites are cyclamenes. If it was only me I would still wear a buttonhole. But with a carnation, not a cyclamen. I would be too visible. I have so much trouble already passing unnoticed. My mother always said : "Victor you speak too much. It will be the lost of you" It's a nice thing, motherly love. It compels you to make sacrifices. Do you love your mother? Don't say no or it will make you cry. Stop your claptrap, old man. I'm not the "mother". Who are you, then? Her sister or something like that. What exactly do you want from the "mother"? I'm not allowed to say that. I'm only the go-between. A little like you. I don't know nothing. Not much, in fact. I'm an anomaly in this business. I wanted to be a mime. I was too heavy. I was criticized for my lack of poetry. It hurts to hear that when you're sensitive. Yet, at primary school, at the end of the year party, I once played a Pierrot. There was a waltz. Everybody was laughing. I'm attracting attention again. It's my big problem. I'm not transparent. I'm not living in a fool's paradise, you know. Go-betweens can easily be replaced... Anyway. You will tell to the lady that it's too late. She was wrong not coming in by herself. Please? A smile? Sit down, Natacha. -You're foreign? -Not at all. I don't know what a guy like you is doing in such a sordid place. -Why does she say that? -Because you're much more worthy. We could have an arrangement if you really want to leave this place. I'd like that, to make a nice trip... I've always dreamt about travelling to Venezuela. Not for the sun or the oil but for the exotic change. -For that you'll have to talk. -I'm OK to talk. I like to talk. -Only to trustworthy people. -Don't you feel at ease with us? If I tell you all I know, rest assured, my trip will be earned. -Immediate reservation. One way ticket to Caracas. -"For passengers on flight 255 toward Caracas... -...Embarcation immediate. -Door 13. Relax and let us make your trip enjoyable." I can never say no. It's unbelievable. People always have their way with me. You want my opinion? He's just the man for us. -The two of you? -We're like twins. -But what about the money? -Our business together? The "mum"? -Business like that is made in private. -Why? -Because you're such a nice man. Is that so? Pascal, Pascal, quick! -What does it mean? -It means I'm the one giving orders. Melinda, Private Detective. And then? Then nobody would benefit from a police visit. Is that clear? -Clear enough. How much do you want? -Come on, my lovely, line up with the others. Can I leave please? I came here haphazardly with my daughter. -Show me what you're hiding? -No. -San Francisco, Copenhague... -Give them back, I'm Catherine Despr?s. If I don't give them back? No more license? Come visit me. I will pay your fee. -It's unbelievable the doe I could make in one night! -Really, Mrs, do we look like murderers to you? I think it's in your interest to let us out of your business here. I give you back the magazines. -I keep the pictures for my private collection. -Are you mad? You have no right to do this! Ferdinand, you're out of your role! -Forget what he said. He's only my husband. -Stop! Stop everything! I'm the guilty one! -Milk gets spilled, it's me! Someone gets raped, it's me! Someone gets killed, it's me! Shoot at me! -Who's the wacky? A wacky. Domino. My sister in law. -Mrs Mado, she knows everything... -Mrs Mado, she knows everything... She's crazy. You heard them. Get up. You. Help me. Now you can call the police if you want or if you can. You hurt? Yes. Of course. His real name was not Victor. But Marcel. Everybody had his way with him. He liked women too much for his own good. I always told him... "You can't be on both sides." He couldn't help seducing people. -They promised they wouldn't hurt him. -Who "they"? -Why did they shoot him? -Who? Forget about it. We both know I'm going to croak. I can't tell you. I don't know much anyway. Victor, I mean, Marcel, had seen something very important at the Shangai Lily's. Then he started to deal with the opposite side. He didn't tell me what he saw. Despite being such a blabbermouth. -We wanted to take their money and leave. -To Caracas? Caracas...He told you that? He really talked too much. Do you know him? He's the devil. Just tell me where I can find him? Shangai Lily's. Is he dead? Yes. There was some quarrel at the club. I will explain later. What do you mean by quarrel? It might change some of your plans. -We had an issue with Victor and... -Not on the telephone. You are incompetent! Good-bye girls. I'm tired and we made a mess with the Tango. Good-bye. Look at my face! And mine. I'm so tired. And we still have a night session. Shit. Says the one asking an advance! You will do the job you were paid for. And this one, still on the floor. I asked you to tidy up. We first buried Fran?ois. And now we're really dead tired! Mrs, I don't want to stay anymore. I was OK to dance and sing but all these corpses bug me. Scram then! And hasten up, you two! Mado is completely megalo... What? Megalomaniac. -Is that so? -Back to work. Andrew, there's something for you in the car. Another one, so soon? -What about those files? -Not very interesting. I've got a sheet on Catherine Despr?s. One of the biggest french fortune. Only one vice, porno. Not a dyke. -Not an orgy maniac. -I think addict is the proper term. I prefer maniac. Only movies and pictures. Right up in our alley! I also have "those". "Mother" Bourgeon didn't talk about "those". Andrew, let's have music. I'm not feeling well. I'd like to vomit. -Feeling better? -Unquestionably. I love you! We must hurry. It's gonna be a long night. Next target? "Mother" Bourgeois. Three corpses for a little... Three? I thought it was only two. But you're right! Andiamo! I don't know these men. You will soon say you never married Bourgeois. I didn't ask you to be so zealous. With the shamble yesterday at the club you will understand...Here's your check. Only problem is I have a few corpses on my arms. You must be used to that kind of situation. What kind of relationship do you have with Catherine Despr?s? Only mundane. How does that concern you? I warn you, Mrs Minister, if you keep on hiding.... You're insane! Forget our arrangement. I can defend myself from now on. You hired me. I guess you know my reputation. I drop a case only when it's straightened out. I will pursue till the end. Even if it means giving you a great deal of unpleasantness. Don't worry about those little mishaps in your path. I will cover for you. I will discover sometimes soon why you made me play this role at the club. But me... I will not cover for you. It's a fake. Go-getter! She's becoming a real pain in the ass that old bat. You know what I think. We really have three corpses. Shit. Already 4.30 AM. Why three corpses? Victor, Alb?ric and the little guy who shot Alb?ric make three. No doubt about it! Park you here. You will snoop inside the Shangai Lily's. I'm taking care of the Despr?s. I'm certain Catherine knows the Bourgeois' son. -See you in one hour. -At home? -At home. -You get excited! -You don't see that in your village! It's rather quiet at home. What's your name? Jackie. Are you sure no-one will come and disturb us? Don't make us wait anymore, big boy! you got us all wet! -You're too cute, you know! -And loaded! -I hope you're not after my money! Are you crazy? A handsome guy like you! -You mean it? -I've never seen shoulders like yours, and a belly... And he falls in our lap! -What is your daddy's business? -Let's forget about him. -Are you not the son of...? -I have loads of money... But it's action I need right now! Not so fast! I'm coming! Here I am, my darling! You'll see us in action now! Take out my panties, darling! What a strange idea, to wear some panties! Wait, let me ride him! I've never been treated so good! If your father was here! Daddy never got it so good! Oh shit, shit, shiiittt! Wow, you didn't hold your horses! He's afraid of nothing. -You allright? -I'm dead! -You want a drink to stir you up? -Yeah, sure. What do you want to drink? Look up there and make your choice. -I don't know...-Whisky? -No, I'd rather not. -Champagne. -Try this. It tastes better than Champagne. And that concludes a day's work! Bravo! Nice catch! You will ask Pascal to carry him to the studio. Well. So long. See you later. Sorry about the intrusion, Catherine, but Des Grieux is waiting for you. A moment please. Lend me your hand. I'm a little worried to see you at my home so late in the night. -It was most urgent, my dear. -It's really late, Catherine. Don't stay up too long. Listen, Des Grieux. I'm an uncomplicated business woman and I'm happily married. Political careerists disgust me. Whatever their ideals. Do you really enjoy this ordinary image you give of yourself? My poor woman! Those two milliard income a year... You wear them on your face! I don't even wear them on my back. I don't give a shit about money! Maybe you've made appointments with your syndicate representatives for too long! -Such a liberal point of view... -Your time is precious. And I absolutely don't want to take part in your political maneuverings. That's not what I'm asking from you. -I only want to take the ministry out of the hands of Fran?oise Bourgeois. -No. How? No and you're boring me to death. You recognize those? They're going round all over Paris. Smuggling pornography is severly punished by french laws. Despite you lack of civism maybe you're still a woman of honour. Blackmailing me? Those photos are old. Are they worth my life? Or yours? Am I a woman of honor? A woman of honor! An advice, Des Grieux... Don't try again to kiss ladies hands. You're being offered a ministry. Take it and say thanks. We'll run it for you. And you will be able to keep on calmly with your solitary pleasures. Monster, bloody fool, get out of here! Get out, Des Grieux. Please. The proposal will be over by dawn. Tomorrow, we'll be merciless. You have one hour to change your mind. Give me the pictures, please. Take them. We have the originals in a safe place. -Here. -Thank you. Mrs, someone is going up in the elevator. Man or woman? A woman, Mrs. See to her, Ferdinand. Take care of everything and make it quick. Then rejoin me. Only your presence cheers me up. I don't know who's sending you but you come at the wrong time. We're sorry. I won't be long, little Despr?s. How did you manage to get hold of these pictures? You will learn nothing from us. Catherine has been careless. That's all. Drop this case. Too much interests are at stake. You're not tough enough. Come, come, come, dear sir! Let's get more psychological, if you want.. I will help you if I can. Right now, it's impossible. In this story everyone chases everyone in an vain and useless hysterical mood. Let the storm blow. By tomorrow morning all this story will look ridiculous. You know the way out. Hey, come here! You know, Ferdinand is very kind. But my sister is completely crazy. They say I'm the crazy one because I got shocked. They smell good! In fact, Catherine... she didn't want to do it. Because she was jealous. Daddy didn't want of her. But Domino was popular with Daddy. She got candies and caresses. Catherine only watched and stayed silent. One day, Daddy left. He didn't like me anymore. He left with another woman. Daddy... Daddy... You can't understand. You know Alain? Where is he? That's Catherine's stuff. Ferdinand is so kind. He grants all her wishes. But I'm not crazy. I know that Mrs Mado is holding Catherine. She'll have to obey. Like I'm obeying to my sister. But that will end very soon. I don't want to stay here anymore. I'm fed up being here, I want to be taken care of. I want to be loved and taken care of someday! Once in my life. Daddy will come back soon and get me pregnant. Go away. Go away! Little Jesus, on his way to school, carried the cross on his back...(crescendo) Natacha is not here? No, not yet. What's the thing so important that get Victor killed? A dirty trick. It was drawn on the wacky's blackboard. Are you really quiet? Are you really quiet? You're really quiet. Can I do something to help you? I know where I can find her. What annoys me the most in this deal is the fact that I don't like women. You're wrong. Don't try to change my mind. Come on, back to work. That Tango (french cocktail), earlier, it was hard to swallow... -Hard to swallow? -Tango, grenadine, swallow! I don't know what you mean. -If you don't like women, what are you doing here? -I'm like Mona (the singer). I'm here for the money. I'm fed up with that dance and I'm cold. -I'm so cold. -Wait for me, my kitty. I love you so much. -Shit! -She's the little picture snatcher. Who did that? -It's not us. -Don't move. Where is Alain Bourgeois? We don't know. We're hostesses. That's all. -Where's your lady boss? -You're paid to search. Search then! -Where's Mado? -Here! You're two? And a camera! It's a movie then! Close-up on him. Close-up on his face now. Isa. Isa, it's your turn. Isa, shoot him. Good. Cut. Well... They've done their part, those two. It's ok, you got all you need? Yes. What's next? You wanted to have a look backstage? You'll be satisfied. Very smart your operation. Blackmailing fortunate customers... Then selling the movies to private collectors... -You win on both sides. -You're much too smart. And much too reckless. Imprudences are a part of my job. Not all of them. Not all of them. After this session, you will have a hard time doing your job. I'm leaving. I'm counting on you. By the way, it could be done this night if you're ready. -When? -When you want. In two hours? So, what are we waiting for, here? They're not all at their places. Everybody's in place, then. Hurry up. Stop him! Stop him! You wanted to use Alain but he's a madman, a maniac, he's extremely dangerous. I gave you free rein. But you're incompetent. It was bloody stupid of you to sell those pictures to Mrs Despr?s. Come on! For god's sake! You compromised her while you compromised us. I think we're not godly enough to play with abnormal people. Even to make our ideal reign. -I mean that to have complete power... -You were a small scale nurse. I got you up the ladder. I took you out of the horde. For the specific purposes you know so well. And to reward me you blabber this nonsense about power and governing! For fuck's sake! Colonel. Of all the women you have submitted I'm the only one who kept mum at the constant affronts. It was not for loving you. It's no more for loving you. It's by faithfulness to our cause. I've ben sold that argument already. Let's not get out of the topic. I'm waiting for your report. -Commentaries are my privilege only. -Pascale just called me up. Lancelote is dead as you already know. And this bitch of Melinda escaped. And she knows much too much that Melinda. Doesn't she? She was there. She saw everything. You should have killed her the first time she entered the club. I was waiting for your approval, Colonel. Unbelievable! You're making capital decisions without consulting me when the ones in your line get engulfed in feminin neglect. I advise you to go and check at once the proofs she got. In a few hours, the game will be over. And I would hate to lose this one. So long. Hello? It's me. It's not too late to make things work for us. In one hour or two we'll be ridden of Bourgeois. We'll control the Despr?s together. Caherine will be obeying me. Good. I'm going at Melinda's place and I'll see you after that. Of course, I love you. She loves me... -Mado? -In person. It things worsen up we'll send the army. Mum's the word when you see your lady friends. Are you mad? They're not my friends. And we don't sleep in the same bed. I got to tell you. I don't want to know which party you belong to. But my heart is not for losers. You want to live until you die. Don't cry, buddy! I don't want to hurt you. -Don't be afraid. -I'm not afraid. I know I'm going to die. -It's written in the cards. -The cards made a mistake. Give me those pictures and files. I don't want more than that. They must not be so important, littering the floor like that. This has to end, Melinda. This story is too important for a crummy jewish detective like you. Mrs Bourgeois didn't ask you to turn the city into a living inferno! I'm going to kill you. We'll put Mrs Despr?s against her will to the ministry coveted by Fan?oise Bourgeois. Her son is too implicated and you know it. -Then, why kicking up a fuss? -I'm going to kill you, Mado. To avenge your little photograph friend? You'll have to shoot this man first. Here's what I could gather. There is still one or two compromising papers at Mado's place. You will get them easily. I don't want to be mixed-up in this political scandal anymore. Catherine would never have given up to this blackmail. She's not enough a woman of honor. You don't seem to realize , Iza. You're sitting on a powder horn. Be careful and try to run before it explodes. In a few hours nothing will matter anymore to me. "For Fran?oise Bourgeois. To be opened after my arrest. You were standing, one day, dressed in a mauve low cut, in front of the fishery, in Alger. Bourgeois had been nominated Colonel. He was watching you waiting for him and laughed at your expense. I was by his side. He liked to mystify, to hoax people. To lie to them to inforce his power over them. You will hold a grudge against me for hiding to you the fact that he was not dead. I put you apart because of your son. And because you have great things to accomplish at the ministry. Since I'm back in France, I've been living on the hope to get avenged. Avenged by myself. Don't try to help me. Life has lost its meaning for me." I was looking for Mado. These days, I see her everywhere. Mado is dead. There's nothing left here that could get you worried. I have a few bills you carelessly vouched for. The rest should be in the hands of police or accomplices. It's more serious. -Police and accomplices can be bought. -You didn't know about the club's operation? Military men. Or his backgrounds? They're not after my money, they're after my public image. I can't accept that. You should have dealed with private editors or unscrupulous men for your private hobby. Your particular habits are not worth of this massacre. I won't leave this world with many regrets. You could get cured. And also get your little sister cured at the same time.. After all, there's worse than incest. Help me. From now on I'm helping nobody. I'm unmasking. It's the end, Ferdinand. I will be arrested or interned. I don't want you to live without me. Good-bye, sweet prince. Yes, on this side all is going fine. My nomination is official but be careful, my darling. No. He has to be terminated. The threat is too big. The Shangai Lily's, of course. Mr Des Grieux, Mrs. I must hang up. See you later. Let him in. News are spreading fast. I'm not sent by my party. My visit is strictly personal. -In the middle of the night? -Time is of the essence. -I may have bet... -On the wrong horse? The wrong card. Spare me your irony. I thought you abroad for a few weeks more. My amnesty is near. Let's suppose... -you obtain the ministry. -It's been confirmed to me. Let's suppose...the night is not over. -You know I have a personal fortune. -Me too. Enough to satisfy your blackmailers? I have exposed my situation to the high ranks and they're not holding me responsible for my son's dealings. They won't agree when they know the real facts. Listen, Des Grieux. Your visit was fun for five minutes but now it's enough. I don't wish to be an accomplice in any way of your party or yourself. -It's... -It's my last word! -I could be the last... -Look for your weapon. Touch it. I'm itching to see it. I thought I had discharged you. Discharged... Funny choice of word... I could have been late. Be reassured. Mr Des Grieux was bluffing one more time. I have a nice surprise for you. Alain? You seem surprised to see me alive. Althought it's only natural. It's only logical. Men like me don't die at war. That is only for heroes, traitors or people like that. My dear Fran?oise. You weren't expecting to see me again. -To get my revenge. -A revenge? For what reason? For betraying me and your country? Already with your ideals, your big ideals. Listen to me. I don't care if you get the ministry or not. It's a political matter. Me... I only wanted to hurt you. To jeer at your mother's pride. To get your darling son dirty. Even bad melodramas need their directors. My taste for intricacies... My thematic for build-ups... My perversity. I didn't want of your son. You got him out of my body by surprise and then you cowardly exploited the situation to tear him out of our land. Why bringing out the past? Remember. -For me the past doesn't exist. -You already had that lofty look then. What a drag! You're no better than the twisted people working for me. I prefer Catherine yet and her elementary vice to you. At least, she doesn't cheat. You and your shoddy altruism... A private detective! Why not the white knight in shining armor or James Bond? This chair suits you fine. With your long arms falling down you look like a big sick monkey. Don't you find this whole story a little bit silly on the edges? Tell me what you did with Alain. -You used to have more neatness. -Don't judge me. I mean, not yet. You and your curiosity will be satisfied, if you turn the lights off and turn this machine on. I lied to you. Alain told me the whole thing. I have to find him. I know where he is. Wait a minute! If you think Mado will let you do your own way. Mado is dead, Colonel. Your machiavellism has lost his first lieutnant. Morever, she was deceiving you. She played double game with Des Grieux and she was hiding Isa. Isa, who is looking for you. Who is Isa? Marguerite! For god's sake! Marguerite! Where is she? You're shaking, Colonel! If you hide yourself after the war in Algeria, if you tried to pass yourself off as dead, it was to make people forget your subaltern rank in the secret army. A puppet, a clever seducer. Isa, disgusted by your intrigues, shot at you, and the brave Alberic made it look like it was a military attack. You were dead. You could secretly come back in France. And get back the fortune that Mado kept for you. Mado, the kind and unobtrusive little assistant. You were so clear-sighted but you didn't know that everyone cheats on everyone for their "ideals". Cheerfully! And Mado cheated on you too. -Where is she? -She kept your assassin in her hand. -The time has come! Look in front of you! -Look in front of you. In the closet... -Where is she? through the windows...under your bed... death watches for you. Everywhere! Come on. -Where do we go? -To the Shangai-Lily's. Alain must be there. Why are you doing all this for me? Did you forget that you hired me? And then... you're the only one who kept her hands almost clean. You're so funny... Mum! You were there, little girl? It's the end, at last. Come Fran?oise. The sun is starting to rise. He was a pain in the ass all his life, this bloody fool. Cheerfully? Timings: Pinhead Translation: aloysius70 CINEMAGEDDON
