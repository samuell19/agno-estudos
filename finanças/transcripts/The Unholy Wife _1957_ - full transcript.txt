THE UNHOLY WIFE I know that in your book, there's no such thing as the perfect crime. Right always come out on top. Good triumphs over evil. The guilty are always punished. And yet I did manage it... the perfect crime. It all began the night before the fair ended, around 11:00 in the house... the house I hated so much, Paul's house, the one they now call the House of Death. [ Gunshots ] Phyllis, you shot him? Why don't you come and take a look for yourself? No, no. I can't look. He's dead, isn't he? Who? But whoever it was out there. Isn't he dead? I don't see anything at all. That's right. But you fired. You said you heard a prowler. I did, Phyllis. I did. Somebody tried my window. Oh, sure. If you didn't believe me, why did you go outside with the gun? To keep you quiet. There isn't anybody within a mile of here, and there never was. Phyllis, I swear, I swear I heard something... something at my window. Well, next time you hear somebody, you do the shooting because the gun's right here, and it's fully loaded. Oh, if Paul were only at home. Paul... what could he do? Well, at least he would believe me. Well, he's not here, and you know you can't get him at the fair. Operator? Operator, I want the sheriff's office. Sheriff's office? This is Emma Hochen. I want to report a prowler. Well, just Phyllis, my daughter-in-law. Thank you. They're going to send a man out. Phyllis? Phyllis! Phyllis? Phyllis? Phyllis, where are you? I'm here. Oh, there you are. Haven't we been looking at Michael? Is he all right? He's sound asleep in bed, and that's exactly where you should be. Now, come on. [ Rattling ] [ Gasps ] Take it easy, baby. Oh, I told you not to come here. You also told me you was coming to the fair tonight, and I waited and waited. I ain't used to waiting. I had to stay here. You might have let me know. How could I with the old woman and the kid hanging around my neck every second? Please go before one of them catches us. It's been all week now, every night since the fair began, and when you didn't come tonight, I don't mind telling you, It was kind of like the time I got trampled by a 'Bama bull. You got me going, baby, really going. For both our sakes, please go. Not without you. You're fed up to the ears here... nursemaid and old lady, the kid. It's time you cleared out. I already told you that was impossible. Unh-unh. You said no, but you told me yes. Six nights now, you've been telling me yes, haven't you? Yeah. Kiss me, baby. [ Engine running ] [ Gasps ] Stay here. Let me go see who it is. Sheriff's office, Mrs. Hochen. And a somewhat dilapidated hitchhiker. Hello, Phyllis. Where's my mother? Where else but in bed? Is she all right? Of course she's all right. So is Michael. Since when have you been working for the sheriff's office? Oh, I'm, uh... I'm not quite that hard up for sinners yet, Phyllis. I was getting a lift into town when your call came. "A prowler at the office," said Mrs. Hochen. You any idea where he might be? Oh, yes. Yes, I have a very good idea. Where? He's wandering around in one of your mother's nightmares. Ever since her last stroke, she's been dreaming that somebody's trying to break into the house. Tonight, it was a man at the window, and she wouldn't go back to bed until I let her phone the sheriff's office. Well, maybe I better take a look around, just in case. Oh, no. I don't want... I don't want my mother-in-law disturbed now that she's finally asleep. Well, wouldn't you like me to stay, at least till Pa gets home? Well, wouldn't you like me to stay, at least till Pa gets home? I told you. It was just a dream. We're perfectly all right. I'm sorry to have been such a bother. Oh, that's what we get paid for, Mrs. Hochen, but I'd, uh... I'd keep this door locked if I were you. Surely you know my husband's views on locked doors. Oh, yes, the family tradition... extra food in the pot, extra places set at table for any passerby. In the living, over the fireplace... "My house is your house, friend, a door never locked." Well, you tell Paul I said to forget tradition. Yes, your reverence. After all, I wouldn't want anything to happen to you, Phyllis. You mean you wouldn't want anything to happen to Paul's wife. I can't deny that Paul is my brother. Good night, Father. Good night, Phyllis. [ Sighs ] They've gone. Well, you sure headed them off, all right. Well, he's his brother, isn't he? Paul's brother, Paul's house... everything's Paul's. Including you, it seems like. Now, you know better than that. I thought I did. What is it you're really after? You. Yeah? Having your cake and eating it, too. Oh, yeah. Can we get out of this house, just for a little? I don't know. Maybe for a minute down to the winery. -Yeah. Phyllis? Oh, it's no good. She'll be out of bed looking for me. Yeah. Instead of shooting at nothing out the door, why don't you shoot the old lady? If I was gonna shoot anybody, it wouldn't be her. Emma: Phyllis? You've got to go. Do you think I like this any better than you do? I'll see you tomorrow at the same place. Maybe... ...maybe not. Depends on how I feel. Phyllis: Michael's precious seashell, but it might just as well have been a stick of dynamite. The size of the explosion depended on what he had seen and what he would tell Paul. I was marked down as the victim, unless... The idea came out of all the little pieces of the night... Stephen fiddling with the old lock, shooting to scare the old woman, the deputy answering the call about the prowler, San saying, "cake and eating, too." Who'd blame me for shooting in the dark, especially if I fixed it afterwards so it looked like he forced the lock? With Paul gone, there'd only be Michael and the old lady. Funny how daylight makes things seem different than they do at night. Almost makes the night things seem unreal. That's how it was the next morning... everything different, the wind cool from the hills, the sun shining down on the vineyards, the vintage coming in, the grapes' names I barely knew but looking like clusters of costume jewelry, too big to be real. The night... San and dreams, only I couldn't quite forget them. Thomasso, where's your boss? Still at the vineyard picking up the loose grapes. Can't blame him, grapes are gold. There you are, Mr. Benton. You're lucky to see these. These are the finest grapes in California, maybe the finest grapes in the whole world, grown by a friend of mine... a friend of mine named Gino Verdugo. Gino Verdugo is a friend. Mmm. Each one of these is hand-selected, perfect draw, rich and full... each a jewel. If I'm not mistaken, uh... Malvasia Bianca? That's right. You know your grapes, don't you? I'll tell you something. From this grape, see, comes a kind of wine that emperors trade castles for. [ Laughs ] Oh, thank you. Then, also, in my opinion, this is the kind of woman that emperors traded castles for. I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. This is my wife, Phyllis. Mr. Benton. How do you do, Mrs. Hochen? Lunch is ready. We have some business to take care of first, hmm? Your brother's here again, so don't keep him waiting, too. -Mike? Yes, Pa? Paul: Come here. Hurry up. Come on. That a boy. Come here. Now, do you want to help me and do me a favor and show Mr. Benton the winery? -That'd be fine. All right. Michael, did you do what I told you? Not yet. Go down to the house. Michael: Yes, Mommy. I guess we'll have to get along without him. But if your lunch is ready, and your brother is waiting... I'll tell you... do me a favor. You'll stay for lunch as our guest. Thank you. Our house is yours, Mr. Benton. The front door is always unlocked... family motto. Isn't it, dear? That's right, darling. My grandfather came from Switzerland and built... And built the winery. That's right. He built the winery, the cellars back here, house, everything outside. To him, it represented the promised land, the land of milk, the land of honey, also the land of good, good wine. I remember my grandfather. I remember my grandfather saying that, "In such good land, there must be good people," so we never have our doors locked. Remarkable. The Hochen tradition, along with feeding stray dogs and tramps. You mustn't misunderstand my wife, Phyllis. It's just that she doesn't understand tradition. She doesn't understand wines, either, for that matter, but we're teaching her. Could I have the wine glasses? That's the tall glasses. I know. Excuse me. Now here... here we have the wine we bottled young... Uh-huh. ...when it is fresh and delicate. Gino, Gino, how are you? I'm glad to see you. We're just trying to figure out whether you grow wine grapes or raisins. Oh, excuse me. This is Gino Verdugo. Gino Verdugo, this is Mr. Benton. How do you do? Pleased to meet you, Mr. Benton. Mr. Benton is a wine buyer from Boston. Excuse me. Paul, I got to speak with you. It's very important. All right. You'll excuse me, please? Of course. Darling, wait a minute. About the wine... before he tastes it, there's the aroma. And the whole routine, I know. Something troubling you now? What's the matter? Nothing's the matter. Come on. You know I told you about that fellow that came to look the vineyard over? You mean the man from Fresno. Well, he came back today at the house to make me an offer. How much? $90,000. [ Whistles ] That's a lot of money. You turned him down. I mean, you told him you couldn't sell? I don't know, Paul. Maybe it's a good idea. I think maybe it's a stupid idea. -Paul, listen, I... No, you listen to me now. Who gave your father the lands and brought the vines from Europe? Your grandfather. And who saved them when they were sick? Your father. And who pays you double the market price? -You do, Paul. All right. You go back and you tell this man, Gino, this man from Fresno... you tell this businessman he should go away and leave the valley alone. He doesn't love the grape. -But, Paul, I... Please, now. I don't want to lose my temper with you. It couldn't have been a dream. The sound was so real, but it was sort of a rasping at the window. Mama, Mama, please, excuse me for interrupting. So, Mr. Benton, would you like some more wine? Theresa. So, Mr. Benton, would you like some more wine? Theresa. Theresa, you bring some wine for Mr. Benton. Would you like some more? -Thank you. You're welcome. Paul, you're not listening to what I'm saying. I'm listening. I told you before. It's all in the head. Besides, Phyllis told me all about your dream. I told you before. It's all in the head. Besides, Phyllis told me all about your dream. Feel dreamy myself. Theresa, please, let me have some more for myself. Did Phyllis tell you what your brother said... to lock the door? Locked doors don't keep dreams out. Grazie, Theresa. But they do keep out prowlers. Yeah, but we don't have any prowlers in the vicinity. You know that. It's ridiculous. Stephen: But if Mama's worried, what's the harm in locking a door? There's no harm in locking a door. I just don't intend to do it. It's as simple as that. Now, Paul, don't speak to Ste... to Father Stephen like that. You listen to what he says. I apologize. I'm sorry. If he wants to lock the door, let him lock the church door. The doors in this house have been unlocked since my father lived here. They're gonna be unlocked when my son lives here. Now, where's Mike? How come he's not at lunch? Well, he said he wasn't hungry. -I'll explain later. That's fine. Just make sure he doesn't miss the rodeo, that's all. Mr. Benton, would you like to see our rodeo? Uh, no... no more wine, please. I don't think Mr. Benton's interested in rodeos right now. [ Laughing ] Right? Who'd want to go to a rodeo with... with all this? -I'm not going either. You must be joking. -No, I mean it. I don't think you understand. The people of the valley expect you to be there. That's tradition. I don't think you understand that you're a Hochen now. Maybe I'm not going just because I am a Hochen. Phyllis: Phyllis Hochen in the daytime, but at night another Phyllis... the before-Hochen Phyllis, the Phyllis of a year ago. Woman: I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear We're drinking, my friend, to the end Nothing. Of a brief episode Make it one for my baby and one more for the road That long, long road [ Applause ] Not much action around here tonight. Begins to look like we eat at home. Begins to look like we eat at home the whole weekend. There. Something's arriving. One of them doesn't look too bad. Yours, I suppose. Oh, sorry. That's all right.. We'll get it. Thank you. There you are. Thank you. I'd be very happy to buy you a drink. Thank you again. Why don't we sit at the table? [ Dance music plays ] Do you live here? No. All my life, I've lived north in San Francisco. And what's a San Franciscan doing in Los Angeles? Convention. Salesman? Sort of, sort of. Let me ask you a question now. Do you come from Boston? No. London. -You come from London? Mmhmm. And what's a Londoner doing in L.A.? The Air Force, Sarge and I met in England. [ Applause ] Can I ask you a question? What happened to the sergeant? Oh, he's still flying. Still flying where? Who knows. So it's just like that? Just like that. Convention over, don't have to go home until Monday. We've got the whole weekend to kill. Convention over, don't have to go home until Monday. We've got the whole weekend to kill. Fascinating. We've got other plans for the weekend. They don't include beer and sandwiches. Well, sandwiches are all they serve in a place like this. Besides, we don't drink hard liquor. Do you want something else? Why don't you ask? What if I said Champagne? Champagne. All right. - Miss? - Yeah. Can I see your Champagne list, please? -Champagne list? That's right. We only have one brand here. Well, could I see it, whatever it is? Yeah. Joe, fella here wants to see the champagne. Big night, huh? This is it. Thank you very much. That's not Champagne. That's not even good cider. [ Laughs ] No. No, thank you, dear. We don't want it. Thank you very much. How'd you like to go someplace and have a real vintage Champagne? -With sandwiches? With caviar, if you like it. -That sounds wonderful. Well, let's go. You get the bill, and we'll get out of here. Is the wine satisfactory, Mr. Hochen? I think you'd better ask the young ladies about that. I want to tell you something, Henry. You may not know it, but you are now standing in the presence of 2 of the world's greatest connoisseurs of Champagne. What's the verdict, girls? -It's great. Mmm. Then you'd better chill another bottle. All right? -Right away. Thank you very much. Hey. You know, for a salesman, you certainly get around. What'd your friend do, rob a bank or something? Why should Paul have to rob a bank? He's got vineyards, fine wine at his big business. He's got lots of money to spend. I wouldn't say that, but I got enough for the weekend. So, now, how about a date? As long as this holds out. All right. Then I propose a toast. This is to Saturday and Sunday for dinner, and then Saturday afternoon, what do you say to the races? [ Laughing ] Boy, that's living. -Oh, I won't be able to go. Why not? It's Michael's day at home. Well, who's Michael? He's a 6-year-old souvenir from the Air Force. Oh. For heaven's sakes, Phyllis, why don't you call the school and just tell them you can't take him? -Oh, I suppose I could. No, wait a minute. Why don't we do this? Why don't we do something that a child would enjoy, like a picnic at the beach? And miss the races? Well, maybe I can fix it so you can be at the races, too. Do you think he'd like the beach? I think so. Man: They're starting for home. There goes Flashfire! Flashfire, you can do it! Run, run! Turning into the stretch, it's the Hawk by a length with Flashfire moving up along the rail. Keep it moving, baby. Keep it moving. They're driving for the wire. It's Flashfire, Flashfire! I win! I win three in a row! How's that for faking it? -I take half your winnings. Oh, no, you don't. Hey, Paul, you hear that? Flashfire, square on the nose. -That's good. Another $50 you owe me. Maybe you'll have to rob that bank after all. Maybe we better wait. There's four more races to go. And I'm gonna nail all four. Come on, Gino. Help me pick a name. Listen, why don't we get out of here? We can out and leave these racing enthusiasts alone, hmm? You looked very beautiful last night in the nightclub. You look even more beautiful by the sea. -Thank you. You're welcome. Do you know you make two lonely men very happy? You don't mind if... if one of the lonely men try to make you happy back? Oh, that's the one I showed you last night in the window. You like that? Beautiful. Mike? Mike! Let me go! Listen. Listen, Mike. I hate you. You mustn't hate me. I like your mom, and your mama likes me, so why should you hate me? If my daddy were here, he'd kill you. He's not here. He's not here, but if... if he was here, Mike, I'm sure he'd do something wonderful. He... he'd... he'd show you, look... look here. He'd show you that. You know what that is? It's a magic shell. Have you ever been lonely, Mike? I'm always lonely. You take this, you put it your hand like that, and you put it up to your ear like that. See? And you listen. Listen now, real hard. Then you hear the sea talking to you, and it keeps talking and talking. As long as you have the shell. then the sea will be there to talk to you. -I do hear something in there. That's right. That's the sea, and the sea's talking to you so you will never be lonely. Come on, Mike. Come on. [ Knocking ] [ Knocking ] [ Knocking ] Who is it? Paul Hochen. What do you want? I have to talk to you about something. There's no more talking to be done. The weekend's over. I think there is some talking to do, and it's very important. Oh, if it's about the money and the bracelet, no sale, and please don't start giving me anything about a wife and kids. I don't have any wife and kids. I want you for my wife. It's not a snap judgment. I have the winery and the vineyards and a house and enough money that I could try to make you and Michael happy. Well... if I have done anything to upset you, I beg your pardon. Is there someone else? I suppose I'm not so tough after all. I suppose I knew that from the very beginning. Look, Paul, you're very nice. That's why I want to be quite honest with you from the beginning. I'm no good. Take Michael... maybe it's because I hate his father, or maybe it's just because I don't like kids. I don't know. Where is Michael? He's gone back to school. Well... It isn't only Michael. Look at this room. It's a picture of me and my life, and that's how it's been always. If I were to tell you the things I've done... No, I don't want to hear anything about what you've done. I don't want to hear anything at all. But you know what you are? You're like a vineyard. You're like a vineyard that has been choked with weeds. It can't breathe, and it can't grow, and it can't reach towards the sun because no one paid any attention to it. And one day there comes somebody, and he takes away the weeds, and the vines begin to grow, and they reach towards the sun... I would like very much to be that someone. So what's this about Mike not having his lunch? He's getting ready to go back to school. What do you mean he's getting ready to go back to school? Paul... Paul, after we drive him there, do you think that we could go on, just the two of us? Maybe we could drive south to Mexico. What are you talking about? Well, it's difficult to explain, but, you see, last night before you came home, I had a funny feeling. About what? Oh, I don't know. Something to do with the house, I suppose. I don't know. I don't understand. You used to like the house. When Mike came here, you were happy. Now suddenly everything's different, everything's changed. Well, what happened? What's happened is that I don't want that feeling again. What feeling? The one I had last night. Don't you think you're just getting nervous over something unnecessary? Everybody around here is getting jumpy. My mother's jumpy, my brother's jumpy, and over some foolishness about a prowler. You're not gonna listen to me, are you? It's not a case of listening or not listening. It's a case of certain things to be considered. Number one is Michael and his feelings. He was promised he could stay here for a month. And number two is my business. I can't just leave here and go marching off to Mexico. And us? Us... we'll have to do what my family's always done. We'll have to go to the fair. It's time for us to be adult. You gonna go, or aren't you? If you want me to. Well, that's sensible. All right. I'll go tell Mike. Hey. Are we all dressed up, huh? All dressed up in our city clothes, are we? Yes, we are. We're all packed, too. Are we really all packed? Well, now, you watch me. See that? There we are. Fresh start. Now we're unpacked. All right? I don't have to go? No, you don't have to go. You don't have to go because you have nothing wrong. See? But Mommy said... Never mind what Mommy said. Now, you listen to me. I just wanted to... watch your hand. First of all, sometimes big people make mistakes like little people. Sometimes they say things they don't mean. Sometimes they say it when they're hurt. Sometimes they say it when they're angry. Sometimes they say it when they're not thinking. You understand? But I didn't do anything to make Mommy angry, unless last night... Last night what? I got out of my bed, I went down the hall, and... And what? Phyllis: And I heard him. And he ran back to bed. Is that all? That's no so bad, is it? You'll have to do... you'll have to promise me something. You'll have to promise me to stay in bed at night. You promise? Yes, Paul. All righty. Now, listen. You go and get a little lunch and then put your rodeo clothes on, all right? -Oh, boy. "Oh, boy" is right. Oh, boy. [ Announcer speaks indistinctly ] [ Band plays ] Now, here he is, wanting to stack up a few more points, and probably he will... that boy is number eight on our program, San Sanford! [ Speaks indistinctly ] And here he comes out into the... [ Cheers and applause ] Ladies and gentlemen, he's got him, he's got him... He's got him. Oh! And that looks like a bad time. We'll have that time for you in just a minute. Well, he's got him... eight seconds flat! Eight seconds flat! A big hand for San Sanford. Boy, there's a man that's going, and a great, great event. [ Applause ] [ Orchestra plays ] Paul, this is the man I told you about, Mr. Brown. I don't want to meet him. You... what are you trying to do? You trying to come here and make the valley? [ Laughs ] Now, Mr. Hochen, it's nothing like that. It's exactly like that. You buy cheap grapes to make cheap wine. And you... you should know better, Gino, even to talk to a man like this. Paul, my kids are all in school... an engineer, a doctor, lawyer. They don't want my vineyard... Let me ask you a question. Do you like the Valley? Do you like me? Of course I like you. All right. Then you can't sell. If you sell, everybody sells. If everybody sells, then the valley goes. The valley goes, Gino, who pays quality prices for quality grapes? You can't sell. Well, I already told him I was going to... I don't care what you told him! Well, I already told him I was going to... I don't care what you told him! You don't sell! Look, it's not your business. I make it my business! [ Crowd murmuring ] [ Bottles clanging ] Coming through. Gino, Paul! Gino, Paul, stop it! Come on! Start the music. Start that music! Come on. Start that music. [ Orchestra plays ] Huh? What are you trying to do, huh? I'll meet you around the side entrance as soon as I can. It's the stupidest thing I ever did in my life. A man shouldn't hit his best friend. You'll probably be sore tomorrow, and you're lucky you didn't break a rib. I'm lucky if I can face my friend. Ah! Take it easy, Paul. Thank you. I never felt so ashamed in my life. Why should you be? You were only trying to protect the valley. It's no excuse. Aren't you ashamed of me? Of course I'm not. You know something? You're wonderful. You know something else? We're gonna take that trip you talked about. [ Chuckles ] Come on. Time to go home. Paul... I think you should go back into the party. Why? Well, you don't want people to think that you're running away, do you? -No. And then there's Gino. You should find him, make up, and apologize. That way, you'll feel better. Are you gonna come with me? No. No, I think that this is something you should do on your own. Anyway, I don't feel very well. It's all this excitement. I'll get a lift home, and afterwards when you've patched things up, you come home, too. I'll be there. All right. [ Wind howling ] [ Banging ] [ Screams ] [ Banging continues ] Theresa. [ Italian accent ] Oh, Emma, what is it? What's wrong? Why, there. Why, that's only the wind blowing the shutters. I fix. Okay. [ Speaking Italian ] Such a silliness from a grown-up woman. No, it's not silliness, and it's not the wind, Theresa. There's somebody out there. There's someone trying to get in. Hello. What's the trouble now? It's Emma. She thought that she heard someone again. I did, Phyllis, I did. And I heard footsteps, too. You heard me coming up from the garage to the house. Is Paul home? Is he putting the car away? You know Paul. Nothing's gonna drag him home before morning. Well, then, why are you here? Because I had a headache. Where's your husband? Oh, he's taking a nap. Well why don't you go and wake him up and tell him you're both going to the fair? -To the fair? Mmhmm. Oh, but Paul said we must stay. Oh, well, that's before he knew that I was gonna be here. Well, I don't think... Oh, well, that's before he knew that I was gonna be here. Well, I don't think... Oh, what difference does it make? It's the last night. There'll be prizes. And everybody in the valley is going to be there. -Oh, could we, Emma? Of course you can. Now, you take the pickup truck and have a wonderful time. Oh, thanks a million, Mrs. Hochen! Two, Phyllis? Mm-hmm. Wouldn't you like a good night's sleep for a change? Well, yes, but... No dreams. No nightmares. Yes. Just sleep. That'll make your eyes bright and sparkling again. Oh, Phyllis. You'll see if I'm not right. Close your eyes. Ahh. Go to sleep. Phyllis: San was waiting for me, but I couldn't go with him yet. For once, I didn't want him too close because suddenly my plan had grown. [ Gunshot ] Gino. Paul? Give me the gun. All night there's been somebody 'round the house. That's why I had the gun. And then when he came in... Paul, I didn't mean to! I'll call the sheriff. Do you think he'll believe me? Why shouldn't he believe you? Emma: Paul? Phyllis? Phyllis? That's Mama. I'd better go take care of her. Phyllis: Lifting that receiver meant the end for me and San. He'd never stay with me once he realized what I'd tried to do... not without the winery and the money, he wouldn't. It didn't come all at once... the new idea. First, it was just a way to keep myself out of it, to get Paul to take the blame. Paul? Before you make that call... ...I would like to say thank you for everything, and goodbye. Why goodbye? Well, you remember when we first met I told you that I was no good, and that I'd been in trouble? I remember you told me a lot of things, and that I'd been in trouble? I remember you told me a lot of things, and I remember I told you that I wasn't particularly interested in them. Well, you better hear them now. Why now? Because when we got married I was on parole, and I didn't get permission. I jumped it. I didn't think that anybody would ever find me as Mrs. Hochen, but now they'll take fingerprints, and when they do, they'll check them, and the parole board will send me back. And after that, I imagine the immigration authorities will take me. Deport you? Supposing we got a lawyer? Do you think that I'd come back here and live, even if I could? Live with you again? Face all your friends? My friends? What do I care about my friends? What about Mike? Think what it would do to him. Better make the call now. Oh, I suppose so. I suppose so. Unless... Unless what? I could say I shot him. I could say it was an accident. Gino and I quarreled at the party. Everybody saw. After you left, we made up, but everybody didn't see that. And I left, and I said to Gino, "Come to my home. Come to my home, and I'll make you a deal for your vineyard." Then, I came home and you told me about the prowler... then the gun... and then Gino came. But you came together. No, we didn't. He passed me on the road. That's how he got here first. Oh, surely he would have told somebody he was coming. He'd never tell anybody anything. He did not want the man from Fresno to know that he was coming here to make a deal about the vineyard. So you see, it's all very simple. Nobody saw him coming. Nobody saw him pass me on the road. He was unexpected. What about my fingerprints? Do you remember what your brother said about locking the door? I remember. I wish I'd listened to him. Well, what if I'd locked the door? What if we made it look as though Gino had broken in? Why would Gino break in? We don't know. Maybe he was drunk. But nobody in the world would think of blamingou if the lock was broken. I'll make the call. You get my robe so it looks like I was going to bed. Phyllis: At least I was safe now. An accident, with Paul taking the blame. Suddenly, the idea began to change shape. What if, instead of an accident, I could make it look like the murder it was, with Paul still taking the blame? No, I won't touch anything. Bye-bye. Paul, where did you leave your car? In the driveway. At the back of his station wagon? [ Engine starts ] One thing I still can't quite figure... why would Gino break in the door? Well, when I was at the fair, well, everybody saw that he'd been drinking. Man'd have to be pretty drunk, break into a friend's house. I think I have the explanation. I imagine Gino broke in just because he was a friend. Phyllis told you how she made Paul lock the door at my suggestion. Yes, she did, Padre, but... Until that time, it had never been locked. All of Paul's friends knew that. They used to just barge in, yell "Hello," so when Gino tried the door... I get it. Thought it was stuck and gave it a shove. The lock, being old and rusty, simply broke. The last button accounted for. Don't take it too hard, Paul. It could happen to anyone. Coming back with us, Padre? You sure you don't want me to stay, Paul? No, I don't think there's any need to, just as long as you come around first thing in the morning. Then we'll talk to Mama. Fine. First thing. Oh, goodnight, Phyllis. 'Night, Stephen. Everything's going to be all right. Thank you for coming. Good night, Mrs. Hochen. -Good night. Good night, Paul. -Hello, Carl. Paul. Phyllis. I'm sorry to have to bring you down here, Paul. I just don't understand why Phyllis has to be here, that's all. Something new has come up... something that requires a little explaining. Tom, will you get the letter? The one we found in Gino Verdugo's pocket. Read it. "Gino, meet me at the house tonight early, while Paul's still at the party. He mustn't find us together because he might use that as an excuse to... I almost think kill you, he's so angry. But, surely, between us, we can think of a way to patch up the quarrel before something terrible does happen. Signed, Phyllis." Did you write that, Phyllis? Yes, I did. I gave it to Gino yesterday evening. Well, you must have told Paul about it? Well, no, I didn't. I... I didn't want him to think that I was meddling with his affairs. Well, I don't mean during the day, but last night when Paul came home? No, I was asleep then. The... the shot woke me up. Paul told you that. But afterwards, you must have told him about it. Well, I didn't. I... I forgot. You know, there was so much excitement going on. You forgot the note? The note that was responsible for Gino's coming to the house? That's not possible, Phyllis. Well, I did. Really, I did! I gave the note to Gino on the spur of the moment, and then, well, so many things happened. Paul, if you want me... That's all right. She, um... she told me right after I fired the gun. Oh. Why didn't you tell Tom last night? I don't know, Carl. I don't know why I didn't. Why do people become excited and confused at times like that? I don't know. I just thought maybe... [sighs] maybe Gino destroyed the note, and there wouldn't be any further complications. There's something very odd here, Paul... the note, your not telling us about it. As much as I regret it, I'm afraid we're gonna have to hold you. He was trapped. And even if he tried to tell the truth, I'd be ready. Just one big lie... that I saw him kill Gino in cold blood at the door. Now no more Paul. All I had to do was wait. But I didn't mind... ...even though it meant no San for a while. I didn't dare see him again, not with everybody in the valley watching me. [ Music playing on radio ] We interrupt this program to bring you a special press bulletin. Paul Hochen, wealthy owner of the famous Hochen Winery, was indicted by the Grand Jury for first-degree murder at 2:05 this afternoon. He was... I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Hochen. Bye. He also said, still strictly off the record, that there's nothing to worry about. There's no real case against you... that is, if you've been telling the truth. You have, haven't you? Have I ever lied to you? No. I'll see you later. All right. Bye-bye. Oh, hello, Phyllis. Um, would you mind excusing us for a moment, Bob? Why, sure, Father. Thank you. Don't worry, Phyllis. He's gonna be all right. But he was indicted. I heard it over the radio. He's still going to be all right. You mean there isn't going to be a trial? Yes, but he's going free. Now, go in there and try to give him all the comfort you can. Paul? What's all this that your brother's been telling me? You mean what Carl said? He said everything was gonna be fine. I don't understand. Why are they still holding you for trial? I don't know why. I don't know. I guess it's just the legal procedure... something like that, I suppose. Well, what about the letter? What does the sheriff say about that? Well, he said that they investigated our story further and that he believes us. How's Mike? Oh, I sent him back to school. Why? Well, let's face it... he's as bad for me as I am for him, and with all this trouble going on and you in here, I just thought it was the best thing to do. - Don't you agree? - I do not. I do not agree at all, no. He should be at home with his mother. That's why I'm here. Don't worry so, Phyllis. I can't help worrying. We're all worried. It will be all right. I know that he's innocent. How do you know? I just know. Have faith. "'Put your faith in Me, ' sayeth the Lord. 'The innocent and the just person thou shalt not put to death.'" That's from Exodus, his very words. He'll take care of Paul. He'll free the innocent, just as he will punish the guilty. Have faith, Phyllis. Yes, have faith. Sitting around that stinkin' hotel, hanging around town, watching them roll up the sidewalks, 9:00. I'm fed up. So you've decided to clear out, huh? About the size of it. Do you like this wine, San? What's that got to do with it? This whole winery, where it comes from... have you any idea just how much it's worth? Well, I'll tell you... about a quarter of a million dollars. Yeah? Isn't that worth getting fed up for? Yeah, it would be if it would drop, but it won't. He was indicted, wasn't he? Ah, sure. They're just going through the motions. I got the scoop on that. The trial will be the same... a breeze... and then we're right back where we started from. What can you do about it? There has to be something. You could tell them the truth, like you told me. Tell him how he killed Verdugo when he found you two together, and... then he rigged things so as to look as though Verdugo had broken in. That'd swing him. You want me to do that? Ah, I guess you couldn't. It wouldn't right... a wife shoving her husband in the... ...gas chamber. Even if he has it coming. So it looks like we rode up a box canyon, baby. Nothing I can do. Nothing you can do. San? Do you believe... in God? I guess. Enough to wait until the trial? What are you getting at? The old lady said something before you came about God punishing the guilty. She's right. I know she's right. So you just stick around, San. You stick around and wait. He said, "I already say I'd sell." What was the defendant's reaction? He hit him... hit Verdugo, and then the fight started. Thank you. Your witness, Mr. Hayward. Hayward: Now, after the fight, Mr. Brown, was there a further meeting between the two? -Yes. What happened? Well, they shook hands and made up. Thank you, Mr. Brown. That's all. [ Gavel bangs ] Court today is recessed until 1:00. -Please clear the courtroom. Will you excuse me a minute? Certainly. Hi, Mom. You look tired. You go home, yeah? But I... I want to stay. I know. I know you want to stay, but you do what the doctor said. You go home, rest, and stay in bed, and you make sure she does. You take her home. -Paul. -All right. Man: Keep moving, please. Man: Keep moving, please. Who was that? I don't know. Now, as to how you found the cars... what did you conclude from their positions? Well, that the defendant had arrived before the deceased like... like you said. Mr. Hayward? Since the deputy's conclusion happens to be the truth, no questions. Yes, sir. I've been with the fingerprint section for nearly 17 years. Very well. It's already been established that no one touched the station wagon between the time Deputy Watkins left it in the garage and you came to examine it. Is that true? -Yes, sir. Now, you would you tell us now what you found when you examined the station wagon? The deputy's fingerprints... Watkins. Mm-hmm. And Mr. Verdugo's... you must have found his, too. No, there were not, at least not on the wheel or the gearshift lever. Somebody wiped them off before the deputy took the car. Objection! The witness is making an unwarranted conclusion. -Sustained. Very well. You stated that you found the deputy's fingerprints on the wheels and the gearshift lever. What else did you find? Well, attached to the ignition key was a religious medal. Your Honor, the People would like to introduce into evidence the station wagon's ignition key to which is attached a Saint Christopher medal. It shall be admitted. People's exhibit number four. Do you recognize it? Yes, that's the medal. Now, tell us what Saint Christopher... or, rather, the medal... showed you. Two sets of fingerprints... the deceased's... Uh-huh. Gino Verdugo's. And the other set of prints... who did they belong to? To the defendant, Paul Hochen. [ Audience exclaiming ] [ Gavel bangs ] Your witness, Mr. Hayward. No questions. You say the lock was not broken by the door being pushed in? No, sir. It was broken from above by some sort of blow. Thank you. Won't you tell us what you found on the lock? Bits of rust and metal scrapings from the poker. And on this poker... scratches and gouges, freshly made? Yes. That's all. Thank you. Now, Mr. McNeil, I've asked you resume the stand to give one more answer... a very important one. A man's life depends upon your answer. It's already been established that the poker was used to break the lock. Whose fingerprints did you find on the poker? We found one clear set of prints on the handle... Paul Hochen's. [ Audience exclaiming ] [ Gavel bangs ] Your Honor... this trial mustn't go on any longer. It wasn't Paul. I killed him. [ Audience exclaiming ] [ Gavel bangs ] Do you honestly expect us to believe at this late date that you killed Gino Verdugo, believing that he was a prowler? Phyllis: Yes. Even after writing him a note inviting him to the house? I'd forgot that I'd written it. Even when you saw him come into the house, you forgot? That's right. I didn't see him till afterwards. Not until the shot woke you? That's right. [ Audience murmuring ] No. I wasn't asleep. How could I have been if I shot him? You're twisting everything around. Or you are, Mrs. Hochen. Now, assuming for a moment that you did kill Verdugo, why weren't your fingerprints found on the gun? Because Paul rubbed them off and put his in their place. Why? He wanted to take the blame. But why? If the shooting was accidental, there was no blamed attached. Why didn't you just call the sheriff? Because... I don't know. Was it actually the other way around, Mrs. Hochen... that you offered to take the blame? I wanted to, but Paul wouldn't let me. That sounds more like it, Mrs. Hochen. Well, I didn't mean it the way it sounds. -Did you touch the poker? No. Did you put Paul's fingerprints on the gun? No, Paul did. Did you break the lock? No, Paul did. Did you move the cars? No, Paul did. Did you kill Verdugo? No, Paul did! Who did? Paul did. No, I did! I shot him! You've got to listen to me. I tell you, I shot him. That's all, Mrs. Hochen. Perfect crime. [ Chuckles ] Suddenly popular in the valley, stories about me in the papers, even the old lady thinking I was wonderful, and Paul... ...Paul convicted, denied a new trial, moved to death row at San Quentin... ...with the world thinking that I'd tried to save him. Don't you think we deserve to know the truth... your own family? I suppose. I just... I just want to make sure it stays in the family, that's all. Paul... did it ever occur to you that Phyllis might have lied about being on parole, and then she might have killed Gino by mistake, thinking he was you, and then having gotten you to take the blame, wrote that letter to Gino so you'd be accused of murder? That's exactly what I think she did. You realize what you're saying? Yes, I know what I'm saying. And believing this... believing that she lied to you, tried to kill you, murdered Gino... you still love her so much you're willing to die for her? What I did have nothing to do with the love of Phyllis. It had to do with the love of Michael. You remember when, after the war, I went to the hospital, and I came out, and I told you there was some bad news? Well, it's just that there is some doubt as to my being able to be a father. And then I met Mike and Phyllis, and I married Phyllis for her son. And if that is a sin, then I ask forgiveness, and if I have lied and I have been deceitful, it's because I don't want my son to bear the brand of his mother being a murderer. Paul, you're so wrong, so wrong. Ever since that first lie, it was evil, as every lie is. What kind of a life do you think you and Mike and Phyllis could have had based on a lie, based on evil? I know now. I know. I realize I've been wrong. And you're still wrong to think you could save Mike by... by protecting Phyllis. Phyllis is his mother. And what does that mean... a mother without love? You love him. You've proved that, but in proving it, you haven't given him a mother. You've lost him a father. Your face when they brought out that Saint Christopher medal... for a moment, you actually believed that line I gave you about God punishing the guilty. Didn't you realize that I got the medal in court? I figured it out later. You figure the rest? What rest? [ Laughs ] What's so funny? I'll tell you what's funny. I killed Gino and then got Paul to take the blame. Now, how's that for a laugh, hmm? Got him to take the blame and then framed him, and he doesn't know it, even now. Nobody knows. [ Clattering ] What's that? Another one of her strokes. She's out cold. You think she heard? She couldn't have. Come on. Let's get her up to the house. Yeah. [ Clock chiming ] Phyllis: 12:00 midnight... ...10 hours and 1 minute... ...and then no more Paul. More than ever it looked like I was successful. My telling San made him an accessory, so he wouldn't dare leave me now, and Emma's stroke... that was working out, too. It didn't matter what she saw or what she heard because she'd never speak again. I don't like the way her heart's acting up. These tablets should help. Now, give her one of these every four hours, but only one, Phyllis. They're extremely powerful. -And the next one at 4:00? Yes. I'll try to have a nurse here as soon as I can. You know, Father, it's strange... her having a heart attack and a stroke at approximately the same moment. She was under a great strain for a long time. Yes, I realize that, but it seems to me that there must have been an additional or sudden emotional shock. Doctor, is there no chance that she might regain her speech? Oh, I'm afraid not, Father. Hmm. Look, I have to go to the hospital. I told Phyllis earlier if there was any change, she could reach me there. All right. [ Door closes ] Phyllis, I have some questions to ask you. Oh? Who was the man that helped you in with my mother? Just some poor fellow looking for work. Do you usually entertain poor fellows with wine in the tasting cellar? All right. Supposing he was a friend... what of it? I think you said something to him that caused my mother's stroke. Just what do you think this something was, Father Detective? That you killed Gino and got Paul to take the blame. Isn't that just about what I said in court? With this one omission... that when you killed Gino, you thought you were killing Paul. You've always disliked me, haven't you? Partly because I'm married to Paul, but mostly because although I was one of the church's little sheep once, you've never really been able to get to me. Phyllis. That's why you want to get rid of me, isn't it? If I wanted to get rid of you, why couldn't I just notify the parole board? What parole board? Thanks, Kelly. No conviction of any sort, ever. Only place her prints show up is on her driver's license. Then she was lying to Paul? Could be, or could be he lied. No. Paul told the truth. Even if we go along with that, Father, it's her word against his. We've got to have something concrete... new evidence, a new witness. Maybe we ought to talk to that cowboy we picked up. Can't hurt. Bob, bring in Sanford. Ran him down through the description the cook gave us. Didn't I see you at the trial? Sure, Padre. I saw you. That's where he claims he met Mrs. Hochen. And you were with her last night? Well, sure. I already told them that. Did you tell them what she was saying to you when... when my mother overheard? She say she overheard something? No, but I know she did. I want you to tell me what it was. Tell the truth. I beg you. My brother's life depends on it and possibly your own eternal salvation. I don't think you'll like it, Padre. I must know. Okay. She, um... She was talking about that confession of hers... Yes. ...saying it was a phony, saying that your brother really did kill Verdugo and then got her to help fake the evidence. Of course, she didn't know the old lady would be listening. I don't believe you. Why should I lie, Father? Want to ask him any questions, Carl? No. Well, all right. Take him back. Well, he's lying, of course. Yeah, but he won't crack... not before morning. If there was only some way for Emma to tell us. Mama. [ Breathing heavily ] Mama, don't try to move. I know you can't. Don't try to talk. Can you move your hand? Mama... I have to ask you some questions, and you must answer by moving your fingers. Lift them once for yes, twice for no. I know it's hard, but remember, it's for Paul. Do you know something that can help him? Is it what you heard last night when Phyllis was talking to that man? Was she telling him that Paul was innocent? Was she saying that she shot Gino? Now, Mama, this is important. Did she say that when she shot Gino, she thought it was Paul? No. But, Mama, she must have. Her whole story of it being an accident couldn't have shocked you so. Stephen: She must have said something. I'll tell you what she found out. She found out that I wasn't gonna spend the rest of my life with her mooning over Paul, so why don't you leave her alone? She has nothing more to tell you. -I think she has. Why? You just got a flat no on that business over my thinking it was Paul. Perhaps you didn't admit that to your friend. I shouldn't think you would, but you said something that gave yourself away. Could you have been telling him how you trapped Paul? I think you've asked far too many questions for one night, Stephen, and if the doctor were here, I'm sure he'd agree with me that your mother must not be disturbed anymore. What she needs now is rest and sleep. It's time for her pill. [ Doorbell rings ] I'll answer it. Father. How is Emma, Father? She's no better. I'd better go have a look at her. Were you able to get her to speak? No, but I was able to make her understand. She acknowledged my questions and answered me by moving her hands. What did you ask her? I asked her if she overheard Phyllis telling Sanford that she shot Gino by mistake. What was her answer? Phyllis: Her answer was no. Did you ask Emma some more questions? Yes. My first question was, did she overhear Phyllis telling Sanford that Paul was innocent, and the answer was yes. Then I asked if she overheard Phyllis say that she shot Gino, and the answer was yes. My third question was, did she hear hear Phyllis say that she shot Gino thinking that he was Paul, and the answer was no. Any more questions? Yes. I asked her if she knew something that would save Paul, and the answer was yes. But that's as far as I... Do you think that we might be able to ask Emma some more questions? Doctor: Father Stephen. Who's been with Emma? I have. How long has she been dead? Dead? Why, I just gave her a pill. One tablet, Phyllis? That's right. Are you sure it was only one? Quite sure. Carl, I left this box of six tablets here. My instructions were to give Emma one tablet at 4:00 a.m. I warned Phyllis that this medication was very powerful and dangerous. There are four tablets missing. Why, I don't understand. I only gave her one. Then who gave her the other three? I don't know! What are you trying to prove? What is your conclusion, Doctor? It is my opinion that Emma Hochen died of an overdose of medication. Well, I didn't do it. I only gave her one, like you told me. Stephen was there. He saw. Stephen, you tell them! Tell them how I only gave her one pill. I didn't see how many you gave her, Phyllis. But you must have seen! You were there in the room when I did it. I did not see. I only know that you told me that you were putting her to sleep so that I couldn't ask her any more questions. Stephen. You're a priest. You've got to tell the truth. Help me. I would like to help you, Phyllis. I swear, I only gave her one. Can you prove it? The... the doctor told me that if I gave her more than one, it would be dangerous, so why should I do it? Why should I be that foolish? Why would I want to be that stupid? You're all against me... everybody. Everybody's against me. Well, I don't care because I know I'm telling the truth! I know it! I'm right. [ Crying ] And I didn't do it! I didn't do it! You've got to believe me. I didn't. I didn't. [ Sobs ] This is an emergency call. Carl Kramer, district attorney. Connect me to the governor's mansion in Sacramento, as quickly as possible. Well, there it is... what I thought was the perfect crime. San telling everything he knew after I was arrested, helping Paul get his conviction set aside, helping him go free... and me tried and convicted, not for killing Gino... but for Emma... something I didn't even do. You know, Stephen, I think what actually happened was that Emma, feeling pain and trying to speak and not knowing just how powerful those pills were, managed to take them herself. But I only gave her one. You believe me, don't you? Yes, I do believe you, Phyllis. Father, is it too late for me to make my confession? It's never too late to confess, Phyllis, but before you begin, I think I should tell you it's my duty to speak to the warden. To tell him that I didn't do it? There's no proof, and what difference does it make? I killed Gino. I tried to kill Paul. And even if I didn't actually poison Emma, I'm responsible for her death, too. Father, it's your duty to hear my confession now before it's too late. [ Speaking Latin ] In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Father... I've forgotten how to make a confession. To help you, include all you've told me in your confession. The important thing is, are you truly sorry? Oh, yes, I am... truly sorry. Stephen: Passio domini nostri Jesu Christi... [ Speaking Latin ] Amen. God bless you. Go in peace. You pay attention. It's very important. Take a grape like that. You hold it gently between your fingers, then you squeeze it. If it pops like that, that means it's ready for wine. That's the Hochen secret. That's what my grandfather told my father and my father told me and now I've told you. Come on.
