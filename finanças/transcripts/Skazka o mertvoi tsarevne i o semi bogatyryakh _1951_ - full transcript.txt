Soyuzmultfilm production Moscow,1951 Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin The tale of the dead princess and the seven knights With his suite the Tsar departed. The Tsaritsa tender-hearted At the window sat alone, Wishing he would hurry home. All day every day she waited, Gazing till her dedicated Eyes grew weak from overstrain, Gazing at the empty plain. Then from God on Christmas Eve She a daughter did receive. Home again from travel far Came at last the father-Tsar. One fond glance at him she darted, Gasped for joy with thin lips parted, Then fell back upon her bed And by prayer-time was dead. Long the Tsar sat lonely, brooding. But he, too, was only human. Tears for one sad year he shed... And another woman wed. She (if one be strictly truthful) Was a born Tsaritsa youthful Slim, tall, fair to look upon, Clever, witty and so on But she was in equal measure Stubborn, haughty, wilful, jealous. In her dowry rich and vast Was a little looking-glass. It had this unique distinction: It could speak with perfect diction. Only with this glass would she In a pleasant humour be. Many times a day she'd greet it And coquettishly entreat it: "Tell me, pretty looking-glass, Nothing but the truth, I ask: Who in all the world is fairest And has beauty of the rarest?" "You, it cannot be denied. You in all the world are fairest And your beauty is the rarest." All this time the Tsar's own daughter Quietly, as Nature taught her, Grew and grew, and came quite soon Like a flower into bloom: Raven-browed, of fair complexion, Breathing kindness and affection. And the choice of fiance Lighted on Prince Yelisei. "Who in all the world is fairest And has beauty of the rarest?" "You are fair, I can't deny. But the Princess is the fairest And her beauty is the rarest." "O you loathsome looking-glass, Telling lies as bold as brass! Now look here, explain to me How can she the fairer be? Scour this realm of ours and seek well, Nowhere shall you find my equal. "But the Princess is the fairest And her beauty is the rarest." "Take the Princess to the forest, Bind her hand and foot and forehead To a tree! When wolves arrive Let them eat the girl alive!" "Well?" demanded the Tsaritsa, "Where's that pretty little creature?" "In the forest on her own," Smudge replied. "And there she'll stay. To a tree I firmly lashed her. When a hungry beast attacks her She'll have little time to cry And the quicker she shall die!" Rumour spread and caused a panic: "What, the Tsar's own daughter vanished!" Mournful was the Tsar that day. But the young Prince Yelisei Offered God a fervent prayer And departed then and there To seek out and homeward guide His sweet-tempered, youthful bride. "How amazing! All so neat! The fire blazing! Somebody's been cleaning here And is waiting somewhere near. Who is there? Come out of hiding! Be a friend in peace abiding! If you're someone old and hoar, Be our uncle evermore! If you're young and love a scuffle. We'll embrace you as a brother. If a venerable dame, Then shall 'mother' be your name. If a maiden fair, we'll call you Our dear sister and adore you." Days flew by?the Princess living All the time without misgiving In the forest, never bored With the Seven Knights abroad. Darkness would the earth still cover When at dawn the seven brothers Would ride out to try their luck With a long-bow, shooting duck. And in time they grew to love her. Thereupon all seven brothers Shortly after dawn one day To her chamber made their way And the Eldest Knight addressed her: "As you know, you are our sister. But all seven of us here Are in love with you, my dear, And we all desire your favours. But that must not be. God save us! Find some way to give us peace! Be a wife to one at least, To the rest remain a sister! Is this to say your offer you refuse? Nothing from our stock you'll choose?" "O my brave and bonny brothers, Virtuous beyond all others!" "God in heaven strike me dead If my answer be not honest: I've no choice my hand is promised! You're all equal in my eyes, All so valiant and wise, And I love you all, dear brothers! But my heart is to another Pledged for evermore. One day I shall wed Prince Yelisei!" "Pray forgive us and I promise You'll hear nothing further from us!" "I'm not angry," she replied. "Greetings, pretty looking-glass! Tell me all the truth, I ask: Who in all the world is fairest And has beauty of the rarest?" "You are fair, I can't deny. But where Seven Knights go riding In a green oak-grove residing Humbly lives a person who Is more beautiful than you." How perplexing! "Had a bad night's sleep, I reckon!" "I most humbly thank you, daughter, God be merciful!" said she. "In return take this from me!" "Enjoy the apple At you leisure, little pet! Thank you for the loaf of bread..." With pure love did we regard you, For your loved one did we guard you, But you came not to the groom, Only to a chill dark tomb." "Who is now by far the fairest And has beauty of the rarest?" "You, it cannot be denied. You in all the world are fairest And your beauty is the rarest!" In pursuit of his sweet bride Through the country far and wide Still Prince Yelisei goes riding... "Sun, dear Sun! The whole year coursing Through the sky, in springtime thawing From the chill earth winter snow! You observe us all below. Surely you'll not grudge an answer? Tell me, did you ever chance to See the Princess I revere? I'm her fiance." "My dear," "I have nowhere seen your Princess, So she's dead, we must presume, That is, if my friend, the Moon, Has not met her on his travels Or seen clues you may unravel." "Moon, O Moon, my friend!" he said, "Gold of horn and round of head, From the darkest shadows rising, With your eye the world apprising, You whom stars with love regard As you mount your nightly guard! Surely you'll not grudge an answer? Tell me, did you ever chance to See the Princess I revere? I'm her fiance." "O dear!" "No, I have not seen the maiden. On my round I only go When it is my turn, you know. It would seem that I was resting When she passed." "How very vexing!" "Wait a minute! I suggest you Have the Wind come to the rescue. Call him now! It's worth a try. And cheer up a bit! Goodbye!" "Wind, O Wind! Lord of the sky, Herding flocks of clouds on high, Stirring up the dark-blue ocean, Setting all the air in motion, Surely you'll not grudge an answer? Tell me, did you ever chance to See the Princess I revere? I'm her fiance." "O hear!" "Where a quiet stream is flowing Stands a mountain high and steep In it lies a cavern deep; In this cave in shadows dismal Sways a coffin, made of crystal. Hung by chains from pillars six. Round it barren land in which No man ever meets another. In that tomb your bride discover!" "Who in all the world is fairest And has beauty of the rarest?" "You are fair, I can't deny, But the Princess is the fairest And her beauty is the rarest!" Overcome by grief and spite, The Tsaritsa died that night. From the grave where she was buried To a wedding people hurried, For the good Prince Yelisei Wed his Princess that same day. Never since the World's creation Was there such a celebration. THE END
