BLOOD RAIN That hostess keeps staring at you. You think it's the first time? Every port I go, it's the same. For a man, strength is everything! Strength? If you've got any strength left, put it into your work. Yes, sir. Grandma! Is our cute little girl back? Stop feeding her! We'll have nothing left. Someone's fallen in! Out of the way! Who fell in? This is a disaster! Why can't you be more careful? These goods cost more than any of you. Subtract it from his salary. If that's not enough, you pay the rest. ...and keep them from misfortune. Provide them with days of plenty, give the farmers a good harvest, protect the paper mill, and give the fishermen a bountiful catch. This cup will bring peace to the island. Have you found the missing crewman? Ahem... not yet... He may try to steal the secrets of our paper manufacturing. Find him for certain, discover his objective, and find out what he has been doing all this time. Blood rain has fallen! You scoundrels! - Take him away. - Why are you doing this again? Father, please stop this! The wrath of heaven is coming! The commissioner is coming! May the Great king of the sea... bless us with fruitful years. Here is the captain. Spare me a little gratuity, will you? Are you drunk again? How many times has it been? Don't think we will keep feeding you money forever. Don't be unreasonable. You know this small tongue of mine can put you in great danger? For the occasional coin I can be kept silent. Don't be so stingy. Come to the port after the shamanic ritual. I live thanks to your generosity. Is the game over yet? I'll bring some money later, so deal first. Hey everyone, we set sail at dawn, so don't drink too much. Hey, don't think you can sail off so easily with my money. Hey you, I'll find some way to cover your pay, so brighten up. Yes, captain. The mood is dark enough already. To cheer you up, let's go see the ritual... Don't you know that outsiders can't go near the ritual? Do you want to bring on misfortune? I'll be watching over you all night! Won't you bring this man some food? I'm on my way. What are you doing? The summer heat is at its peak. Do not concern yourself. It may be the last time for me. I should at least offer my respects. My lord, please don't say such things. Please stay healthy, and continue blessing us with your benevolent rule. Benevolent rule? Don't you know this village has no ruler besides our king? Are you trying to make me into a traitor? If you speak such reckless words again... I am filled with shame, my lord. Have you been living comfortably after tearing my body to shreds? Commissioner KANG! Your blood shall soak the ground and your flesh stripped to the bone! Captain, something terrible has happened! Fire! Put the fire out! What happened? Fire! Fire! What happened? What were the guards doing? Save the paper first! Go and save the paper! Day 1 It's just a small island, but due to the paper mill, it has become the province's wealthiest area. Most of the paper is sent to the mainland or to China, but twice a year it is paid to the government as tribute. The burned paper was of the highest quality, destined for tribute. Sir, we have almost arrived, please try to bear it a bit longer. You must have suffered during this long journey. I am JO Dal-ryong, the man who wrote you. This is the emissary, came to investigate the case. I am Officer LEE Won-kyu. Is there another port on the island? No, this is the only one. It may have been arson, so no one should leave this island. It is absolutely forbidden. I trust you've been well, and all is fine with the governor? You knew of the emissary's visit. What kind of reception is this? Are you looking for a reprimand? It shames me to inform you, but this morning... The people cleaning up discovered it. This is JANG Hak-soo, one of the workers at the mill. This is the son of Lord KIM Chi-seong. I am KIM In-kwon. Is your father doing well? Yes, sir. I met him when I worked as a palace guard. He was a man of honor. There is little bleeding around the wound. And as there is no swelling, he must have died before being impaled. It seems that whoever committed this act bore a deep grudge. You scoundrel! You set the fire on the ship, didn't you? Stop talking nonsense. During the ritual you were milling about the cargo ship! Isn't that right? Aren't you the one who poaches from the sesame field? You! Losing the ship was bad enough, now I'm accused of murder? It's not true, my lord! What did you do last night? I was in low spirits, so I drank with my crewmen all night. I'm not lying, sir! Is this true? Yes, sir. After leaving the tavern, the captain went to sleep. At dawn... it was close to dawn. From the corpse's rigid condition, it seems JANG Hak-soo was killed a couple hours past midnight. If the sailor's words are true, then he cannot be the criminal. This is Doctor NAM. This is Doo-ho, a paper mill dyer. He will draw the autopsy illustration. And those men...? - They will perform the autopsy. - Let us begin. 20 centimeters long. 20 centimeters. Who is this man? His name is JANG Hak-soo, a lazy man... ...who usually spent his time drinking and gambling. While the town held the ritual, he was gambling as usual. Did you make inquiries about who saw him last? Yes, but it appears no one saw him after his fight with the captain. We couldn't find any further wounds on the body. Was he poisoned? Yes, sir. I also learned a local medicine shop grows aconitum. That is correct. It is effective against neuralgia and chills. The plant's root is very poisonous. It is used to make poisoned arrows. What were you doing after midnight? I was sleeping at home. I heard you bought some aconitum a few days ago. Yes, I bought it for my neuralgia. I heard you bought at least a month's worth. Then where is the remaining medicine? You don't have any. Because you poisoned JANG Hak-soo. And you impaled the corpse to hide the cause of death! This isn't much, but please eat your fill. So he has fallen ill. I hoped to greet him after these many years. Did he happen to remember my name? Yes. You requested your brother-in-law's promotion when he was in the State Archive... It was nothing. I just wanted to show my gratitude, for looking after my brother-in-law. I hope his condition improves soon. I will let you know when he feels better. You have solved the incident in a matter of days... It was all thanks to the Emissary. That's not true... I did nothing. Did you know that he is the son of Lord LEE Ji-sang? Like father, like son... Is that so? I have the honor to meet his son. Surely there is no one who hasn't heard of his Lord. Could you tell us about your father? He was very strict with me. Even though he spent many days away from home, I felt that not a day passed without his reprimands. So whenever he came home, I tried to stay outside to avoid him. What did you do so wrong, for your father to scold you so often? It's not that. Each time he came home, he gave me a riddle. They were difficult, but he scolded me for being wrong or not answering. So I couldn't help but want to run away. I'm sure he did so to keep you studying. Would you mind telling me one of his riddles? Would you like to try to solving one? One day, he gave me this... A 60 bo circle piece of land is inscribed with a perfect pentagon. A 3-square bo plot of land yields 30 doi of barley. Nine farmers give the landowner 80% of their barley harvest. If, due to a drought, the yield were reduced to 30%, how much would the landowner receive? That's quite a challenge. It's 34 bags, isn't it? Using trigonometry and statistics, we find that number, but that's not the answer my father wanted. Then, did you find the answer? Yes, I did. I can't come up with anything. I hope you apply the same brilliance to find who burned the cargo ship. Day 2 Is there a man here named PARK? Yes, sir. You set the fire out of anger at being beaten by Commissioner JO? No, my Lord. I was at the tavern... This man was drinking at my tavern. I was watching over him. Did you serve him food at the inn? Yes, I served him food, then... You spent the night together with this man? Yes. No, it wasn't like that... At the start of the ritual, JANG Hak-soo was at the harbour? Yes, lord. He was drunk and wandering around the harbor. When you discovered the burning ship, did you see where the fire started? Maybe it was near here. What color was the smoke? Blue! Blue? Yes, it was a dim blue color. You were drunk, weren't you? Yes, I was drinking, and with the hostess, then... Why is such a large paper mill located on this remote island? This place has long been famous for its sweet gum trees. The water and sunlight are ideally suited for paper making, and furthermore I heard that the mill's founder, KANG Seung-ryul, wanted to keep the methods of his craft secret. Welcome, my Lord. I will guide you. Mulberry trees are mashed here, and mixed with glues and dyes. Then the pulp flows down this drain and collects in that container. You surely know how important the paper tribute is. If the tribute is late, you will be severely punished. I am pushing my workers day and night to produce paper, but it will still take at least one month. Who suffers most if the tribute is lost? The mill's owner will suffer the most. His punishment will... Did the murdered JANG Hak-soo have a grudge against the owner? Not at all, my lord. The owner never had a problem with anyone. But Hak-soo held a grudge against everyone else. In my view, it seems everyone is happy he is dead. My lord, watch out! My lord, are you hurt? My lord! Quickly, get a doctor! I am alright. My deepest apologies. Thank you. My lord, the captain is here. Let him in. All the crewmembers say they don't recognize these objects. Do you know where any of this came from? I'm not sure... this isn't from the mast. If they don't belong to the crew, where did they come from? Has anything strange happened recently among the crew? Three days before the fire, a crewman named LEE went missing. What kind of man is he? He spoke rarely, and kept to himself. He didn't mix with the crew. Was this his first time to the island? No, my lord. Has it been three years? Every year he's volunteered to come for the paper tribute. The wound is deep, so I applied medicine. It should start to heal now. Open the door. Officer JANG! I just heard about it in detail. Did you get rid of Hak-soo because of that? I was so worried that he would talk. But why did you do it that way? Why did you impale him on a spear? I only poisoned his drink. Why would I do something like that? You didn't do it? The voice of the shaman was definitely Commissioner KANG's. People even say they saw blood rain. Please get me off this island! I can't bear it any longer. Listen! Tomorrow, you will be sent to prison. I'll make a deal with the prison guards, so keep quiet. Even if you suffer greatly, trust me and don't say anything. Understand? Help, help me! Please help me! Forgive me! Please forgive me! Day 3 What is this? What kind of stench is this? My lord! As if punishment for high treason, one has been impaled on a spear, and another boiled alive. What are they trying to hide? I heard Officer JANG dropped by last night. Please, get me off of this island! You must explain what is happening before we send you anywhere! - After HWANG Sa-young's execution... - The catholic traitor? ...five anonymous men informed on Commissioner KANG. He was found guilty of providing money to HWANG. KANG was discovered to be a Catholic, and so to set an example to others, the Inquisitor killed one family member a day, in five different ways. What do you mean, five different ways in five days? His young son was impaled on a spear. His daughter was boiled to death. His wife was suffocated with paper, and his old mother got her head cracked. And on the fifth day, Commissioner KANG had his limbs torn from his body. Then someone is killing the informants in the same manner? The informants were anonymous, how did he know who they were? How should I know? Are you one of the informants? Then you must know the remaining two informants. We must solve the case to send you to the mainland. To solve it quickly, we need to know what he wants. How can you solve a murder committed by a ghost? You're the one who killed JANG Hak-soo. I poisoned him, but I did not impale him on a spear! There must be a report at the government office. Take him away. Yes, sir. Protect me, please! I may be next. Put one officer on guard, and have others lie in ambush. If he's speaking the truth, the murderer will come to him. I looked in KANG's account book at the paper mill, and most of the townspeople were in debt to him. But when he was charged with treason, all had their debts forgiven. After KANG died, KIM Chi-seong, who owned 20% of the mill, became owner. Please look up there. Catholic families have talismans in their homes. Before being punished, Catholics may renounce their faith, but for KANG not only was that procedure omitted, but he was executed on the island without being sent to a court. Perhaps his family... So he was executed without reason? Perhaps the reason why the informants were scared to appear is because, for false accusations, informants would be executed by the same means as the accused. Lieutenant LEE! Now you are thinking dangerous thoughts. To say that KANG's family was falsely executed is to imply the Inquisitor, acting in the King's name, failed his duty. Everything we know suggests that KANG was not Catholic. And someone who knows this is taking revenge on the informants. What are you talking about? What's the connection between KANG and the arson? Do you mean that a traitor has followers on the island? If the criminal is killing the informants, three more remain. So you posted that notice? People are reading it and becoming even more worried. Public sentiment is tossing like the sea in a storm. If we catch the criminal, people will be put at ease. I must meet your father. He will know better than anyone what happened then. My father remains ill from the shock of the arson. Please wait until he has recovered. Surely, we won't bother him without any evidence. As he is ill, we will wait for his recovery. What is your reason for staying in this place? Is it devotion to your dead master? If you are so devoted, then why are you still alive? Your master died, so why don't you follow him? Why do you live on with no regrets? That is not the case, my lord. The cauldron where JANG died was for mixing dye. Was that your responsibility? Yes, my lord. However I did not use it on that day. - I will ask... - When did you start serving KANG? I served him since I was 7 years old. I was orphaned before coming to the island, and he took me in. I heard KANG taught you drawing. Can you write as well? Only my name, with effort. Is this Commissioner KANG? Yes. Drawing or holding a portrait of a convicted man is a crime, are you aware of this? I didn't know that, but they are like parents to me. I will confiscate it. By the way, do you think the commissioner was guilty? I am asking you if the commissioner was Catholic. I don't know of such things. Doo-ho was sick for 5 days after barely saving So-yeon. Commissioner KANG treated Doo-ho well, and Doo-ho would've given his life for the Commissioner's family. Where was Doo-ho during the family's execution? He was nowhere to be seen. Afterwards he stopped speaking, and has been living at Commissioner KANG's house. You scoundrels! You will be punished! You must worry about your father. He was fine until Commissioner KANG's death. Commissioner KANG's death? Why? Was he connected to the KANG incident? No, sir! It's nothing like that. Don't be frightened. I didn't mean to inquire about it. Actually, KANG had been very generous to my father. People say he was killed falsely, so he is tormenting my father. Look, you! Blood rain has fallen! Oh, father. Don't, please! It is me. There's been no movement. With just one man standing guard, he'll be suspicious. I know. The criminal may try killing Dok-gi before we get him off the island. But he'll surely know there is an ambush behind the single guard. Then, will we not be able to catch him? Instead, Dok-gi will be safe. That is our priority. But the criminal may be reckless. In that way, we would catch him through Dok-gi. Two birds with one stone. There are no marks or cuts on his neck. With paper covering his face, he died from suffocation. Commissioner KANG's wife died in the same manner. Nothing but a ghost could have... Hold your tongue! The criminal killed this suspect right under our noses. Now people think there's a ghost in the village! When this case is closed, I will punish those who failed in their duties. My deepest apologies, sir. What were you doing while three people were killed? Are you going to let the criminal lead you in circles? Do you know what is done with the property of a traitor? It is confiscated or given to the informant. If you can't find an informant, then look for someone who suddenly acquired property. I did investigate property holdings, but I couldn't find any clues. That is why... I need to investigate KIM Chi-seong. According to your words, he's the most obvious suspect after acquiring the paper mill. Even though he was dismissed, he ranked high in the Hongmunkwan, so we can't investigate recklessly. Then allow me to send a man to headquarters, to check up on the Inquisitor of that time. Must we really do that? We can at least find the identity of the informants. If we find nothing even after investigating the Inquisitor, then you will answer for it. Take him away. Who will be next? Come out front! You won't go into the paper mill either? Sir, that place is haunted by Commissioner KANG's soul. Sir, kill me if you have to. But KANG's ghost... - Very well, I'll kill all of you! - What is this? We have to deliver the tribute as soon as possible. These men have refused to work. So you're flogging them one by one? It was my order. We do it to keep discipline at the mill. Continue! Is this pavilion a tribute to Yeomgye JU Mu-suk? Day 4 Why does a man like you of such learning not go to the mainland and take up a government post? Rather than dirty myself in the chaotic world, I'd rather look after the island's welfare. If so, you must treat the people with care. Did your father teach you that as well? The riddle your father gave you... Do you think I don't know the answer? The rich cannot take even one bag of rice. That is right. In a bad year, all will die from hunger, so the rich must show mercy. However, I don't agree. If we show such mercy, the poor want more the next year. The poor feign weakness to the strong, and act strong before the weak. That is their nature. Human nature is dangerous so one should avoid extremes. Punishment in times of chaos makes them harder to control later. Don't judge by the standards of the mainland. If the tribute is late, then it is the lord who will be punished. The men who refuse to work put these charms in the mill. Men who consult shamans and are scared of ghosts cannot be treated with sympathy. If we catch the criminal, their fears will be laid to rest. You mean, wait until all five informants are dead? I will treat the workers in my own style, you just concentrate on catching the criminal. Where is the shaman's house? You don't believe it, do you? KANG's spirit, you mean? Then why did he wait 7 years to take his revenge? Even with the smell of blood in the land, you don't believe? A bad small means something is wrong with the air or water. I don't believe so. It's the smell of a ghost. A drowned ghost smells of a drain pipe, a burned ghost smells of burning hair, and a ghost that was hung smells rotten, and... a ghost that had its limbs torn off reeks of blood. The deeper the grudge, the stronger the smell. Do you know of an illness called Simheoro? The blood in one's artery becomes blocked due to fear. People often say they are possessed by ghosts. Those afraid of fire blame a fire spirit. Claustrophobic people blame a house spirit, so they rely on a shaman. But it's a disease of the mind, not of ghosts. It may be easy to blame ghosts, but in the end it's wrong. Now stop fooling people with these. Next time you'll receive more than a warning. My lord. One more vengeful spirit has appeared. On a night without a drop of rain, I heard a crack of thunder near the cliff. From that night on, I've heard the crying of a ghost. That's when this fever of mine started. Do you believe the shaman's words too? No, but that was the day crewman LEE went missing. The sound the shaman heard may have been a gunshot. You've mobilized sailors and officers because of one man? After he disappeared, mysterious things have taken place. Perhaps he holds the key to these incidents. The criminal must be stalking his next victim. Find him by today. My lord! Ah, and could you find out how KANG lived on the island? You want me to find that out for you? Set it down. So according to the shaman, this wound is from lightning. Judging from its small size, it was a flint gun, not a rifle. She died 3 days before the ritual, so it's been 10 days. In this heat, how did her body remain so fresh? Was it cool inside the cave? Not especially. These look like crewman LEE's clothes... Then was LEE a woman? This is a paralysis drug. Did you say a paralysis drug? When I was in Hanyang, a series of rapes were carried out by upper-class philanderers. They used this drug to paralyze women. Originally it was used by Japanese doctors for surgery. The young men bought it from Japanese diplomats at a high price. It's sealed so tightly, it can't have been for her use. She must have been delivering it to someone. But what's this character? The meaning is a mystery to me. It's an ornamental message. Women separated from their husbands often send it in place of a letter. It's a kind of love letter? You might say that. The method of interpreting it is always different, so only the person it is intended for can read it. Did you ever see her meet anyone? I didn't even know she existed. This is So-yeon, Commissioner KANG's daughter. Her face is a bit different, but with this brooch, she must be the girl in Doo-ho's drawing. Can you recognize her? Didn't she die 7 years ago by being boiled alive? Her face has changed, but what my lord says seems to be true. However, seven years ago I buried her myself. There must have been others that died at that time. Yes, that year an epidemic killed many people. Someone must have saved her first, and put another body into the boiling water. She's been coming back for 3 years to meet the man who saved her, but the informants found out and killed her. So the criminal is murdering them to avenge the girl's death. Lieutenant LEE! Track down and capture Doo-ho at once! You said he can't forget his old master and still lives in his home? The rest of you, find out who owns a flint gun! Yes, sir. I have to get off this island. Out of the way! So you need to be beaten first, before telling the truth! Beat this man until he speaks the truth. Yes, sir! My lord! Save me, please! I will ask again. Where is the gun? I lost it a few days ago. Or did you hear that KANG's daughter was found, so you tried to hide the evidence? I'm not sure what you... You were scared that people would learn KANG was innocent, so you killed his only remaining daughter! No! My lord! My lord! It's true that I was an informer, but I didn't kill the daughter. They said they needed the gun, and asked to borrow it. So all I did was to lend it to them. I never knew the missing crewman was So-yeon. I had no knowledge of what was happening. Who is the last informer? Let me get off this island. KANG's spirit... I need to know to catch the criminal! Who is it? It is... Father! Are you awake? What happened? It was difficult to move you, so I brought you here. And the criminal? By the time I arrived, he had already vanished. Thankfully, you are not seriously hurt. What is this? It is boiled water. The stench is getting worse, even after boiling you smell it. Is the shaman in? Why are you taking our cow? What are you doing? How can a farmer live without a cow? We told you we will return it shortly. Do you think this will quell KANG's anger and stop the killing? Leave us the cow! He's killing a man a day, in the same way KANG's family was killed. On the fifth day KANG's limbs were torn from his body. The criminal will need horses or cows to carry out the crime. We're turning this island upside down. Trying to catch a mad dog is never easy. Look! Now we must catch the culprit and prove to people it's not a ghost. Yes, my lord. But did you inquire about Commissioner KANG? He used to hold the respect of all villagers. He used to loan money at low interest, even to new arrivals to help them get established. He also treated people according to their abilities. He taught Doo-ho drawing and made him a dyer at the mill. So Doo-ho has a motive for seeking revenge. But if KANG was such a kind man, why did the townspeople just stand by when his family was murdered? They must have been afraid. Nothing's more precious than your own life. Besides, they all owed him debts, so they must have wished for them to be cancelled. There's also the problem of the Inquisitor. For executions, men are tried thrice and then brought before the king, but he ignored the law and sped the execution, perhaps for ambition or his own personal grievance. Don't rush to conclusions! Don't you know a general's honor is more valuable than his life? The criminal is committing such acts because the past is still alive. If nothing's rotten, then there is no stench. I said to hold your tongue! By tomorrow, the man we sent to the police office will return, and we will know the truth. Our only task now is to prevent the final murder. Day 5 Did you have a look? It appears nothing happened last night. There has been no disturbance with the horses and cattle. Are you certain we have all the livestock on the island? Yes, only the animals at KIM Chi-seong's stable remain, and those are under guard. If you've got any strength left, put it into your work. Yes, sir. The criminal placed an already lit lamp into one of the boxes. At first, the lamp was heavier than the bronze weight. But as the wick burned, the oil slowly began to disappear. Finally the lamp, becoming lighter... ...touched a wick on the top of the box, and it ignited. The fire was started to bring JANG, one of the informers, to the island. It's strange. Instead of going to the mainland, he starts a fire to bring him here? Perhaps the criminal cannot leave the island. So-yeon risked her life to come because the culprit cannot leave. This morning, So-yeon's body disappeared. KIM Chi-seong discovered it when he went to perform rites. Sir! I must speak with you! Sir! How can you bother a sick man? Who is the remaining informant? Stop with your questions. You had the most to gain from Commissioner KANG's death! Do you really think... ...that people accused Commissioner KANG because of money? You're saying there was another reason? One reason the paper industry flourished on this island was the help of minister JEONG, who was close to Commissioner KANG. Thanks to the help of the minister, it was easy to trade with China. However, after our previous King passed away, a rival faction accused JEONG of being Catholic and executed him. Afterwards the government investigated JEONG's acquaintances, so not only I, but the livelihood of the island was put at risk. So you needed to sacrifice someone? JO Dal-ryung and Officer JANG came to see me, telling me how to bring peace to the island. For the peace of this island, I gave them my consent. So has peace come to the island? How can you negotiate peace with men of such a mercenary nature? I didn't know what kind of men they were. I may have been dismissed, but as an aristocrat you can't expect me to be familiar with lowly commoners. Is that it? You can't accept a lowly industrialist amassing great wealth and winning respect from commoners? Since they might be found innocent, you had the entire family killed? What was the price you paid to the Inquisitor? If a commoner shares the table with an aristocrat, or a lowly butcher takes up commerce, it upsets the foundations of order! If that isn't a sin, then what is? Doesn't a man who accepts the government's pay understand this? Didn't you also run the paper mill with Commissioner KANG? I only supplied land, to provide the government with paper tribute. You call him an innocent man? Even if he is not Catholic, he opposed the laws of heaven and defamed the king. Is this island's peace maintained by sacrificing someone whenever it becomes necessary? Live a long and healthy life. You watch your tongue! If I were an informant, I would gladly give my life for the stability of this island. However, I am not. Due to that incident, my service to the king ceased and I have never been summoned again! Now, get out! People are dying as we speak. We need to catch the murderer. Now tell me who the other informant is. Did you inform the governor? Yes, he said even if we have to question all villagers, we should catch the arsonist and murderer with all haste. Did you find the documents at the police office? My apologies. I rushed there after receiving your message, however all documents related to the case have disappeared. As JANG was an informant, it's unlikely he'd leave anything. If we send someone to the capital, we can identify the informants in a few days. There is no time. And the inquisitor? Did you find out who the inquisitor was? I did. The inquisitor at that time has already passed away. When did he pass away? It was five years ago. Who was this inquisitor? He received an order of merit for executing rebels, and was promoted to head general. He lived in Jaha-mun, and his name... You scoundrel! So it's true you gave money to HWANG Sa-young! With such clear evidence, if you refuse to confess, you will be torn to pieces! I've been falsely accused! I've never made such an invoice as this! You deny giving money, you misled the commoners, Do you think your Catholic tongue can fool us? My lord! Mother! Arrest him and his family. Yes, sir. Bring me all the men who informed on me. Then the real truth will come out. A lowly merchant worships a beast and defies our king, now he is scared of nothing! Everyone on this island knows I am no Catholic. With evidence so concrete, You sure are dare to die. Let go, you! Falling into Western learning, this man has turned traitorous and even injured a servant of the king. A law exists to execute such a vile man with his family to set an example for others. Somebody... please say something. You all know the truth. You all know that I'm innocent. Elder HEO! You know the truth. Please say something. Say something, Elder HEO... Listen, sinner KANG Seung-ryul! According to the great law of China, spreading deceit through treacherous words is punishable by death; while practicing Western learning and contacting foreign countries in order to incite rebellion is such an extreme sin as to be unforgivable. Of the sins, the greater punishment of the two must be meted, thus under the dictates of heaven you are to be drawn and quartered to set an example for others. Begin the execution! Begin the execution! Yes, sir. Very well... All of you, remember how I died. You can be certain that I will come back to you. Without fail... Shut that filthy mouth! Yes! Commissioner! My lord! The commissioner is inno... One day, when my blood fall like rain... Your blood shall soak the ground and your flesh stripped to the bone! Did you guess the answer? Yes, we can't accept even a grain of barley. Why is that? The landowner has supplies of emergency grain. A true person of the people must show mercy to the farmers. A farmer feeds his cow, even if it can't complete its work. That way, it can till the fields later. Public sentiment can be dangerous, so extremes should be avoided. Those punished in harsh times will be uncontrollable later. Welcome, my lord... Die! Die! Search the area! Yes, Sir. Mobilize all of the officers, send them to guard the horses and cattle, and make a thorough search of the island. And you go assist Officer LEE. My lord... Are you preparing for a ritual? Yes, my lord. A ritual to soothe departed souls. Do you think it is all over now? If your work is to right wrongs and to erase injustices, then mine is to help the departed find their path to heaven. To right wrongs? My lord, have you forgotten? You spoke of the disease called Simheoro. If you can't escape that well, you might suffer from it forever. If a departed soul roams in this world, will threats bring it peace? This is tea made from morning glory seeds. It will help you feel better, my lord. Those seeds cause hallucinations. You use charms to deceive the ignorant masses, now you want to do the same to me? My lord. Charms do not harm anyone. They merely amplify good fortune or block evil. The charms I draw for people are to protect them from KANG's ghost. So? Those who fear his ghost come to request charms, but there are so many I can't remember their names. It seems that every person he knew was an informant. My lord, someone is waiting for you. None of you fools will be able to avoid it, none of you... The blood of Commissioner KANG... He said he'd strip our bones and suck our blood dry... Oh, father! Not again... Commissioner! Father! Oh, Commissioner. I've wronged you. I'm sorry. What are you doing? Father! Oh, father! Father! Oh, father! He's not dead yet! Hurry and move him inside. He's already beyond hope. We can't save him. He is still breathing. A man who calls himself a doctor won't even try to help? Did you have large debts to KANG as well? Still, at least this man still holds a conscience. Do you know why doctors like you can still make a living? It's not your vaunted ability, it's because people don't die easily. Go on and move him! Go on! Move him in... My lord, why don't you be on your way. Children who can't drink clean water are falling ill. Fish are dying, and the stench is everywhere. Those men killed KANG's daughter and angered his ghost! Doo-ho is afraid of KANG's ghost. He isn't the murderer, he's the last informant. The criminal has easy access to the mill, and has never once been sighted near the sea... ...it is KIM In-kwon. People with Simheoro for the sea cannot board a ship, and in severe cases can't even watch the sea. KIM In-kwon has Simheoro for the sea. That's probably why So-yeon carried the drug. But he only has one horse, and aren't we looking after all of the others? At the paper mill, with In-kwon's knowledge of mathematics, he will be surely be able to tear off a man's limbs. Your lust for the lady is greater than the master's grace? My lady, Wake up! I almost forgot that you are a man too. Yes, you're right. I said I would judge people by ability, not social status. But I am also a man with a daughter. A patron? Yes, he is a patron. He turned me into a mad dog. It didn't matter whether I had feelings for her or not. He said one day I could live by ability, not my social status. But I remained a vulgar commoner, made criminal by saving his daughter. If this was the case, why did he give me hope, and make me hate him enough to kill him? Ask KANG for forgiveness after you die. Forgiveness? But you, in your desire for her, have become a murderer. Go ahead and kill me! Go on. You and I are the only ones who know this. Silence him, and let's finish this quietly. KIM In-kwon is different from Doo-ho. The words of KIM Chi-seong's son could cause a great disturbance. The only way I can atone for the innocent people killed by my father is by revealing the truth on my own. And he knows that. Wait. In that year, many people were accused and executed. The death of Kang's family was only a small part of it. However, there are people who, thinking of their own sins, don't want that small part disclosed. You are young. Think of your future and your family. You said honor is more valuable than life to a general. Sorry, but I'll request punishment for my disobedience later. You need not observe rites any longer. This is my reason to continue living. I gathered the remains of your father and family. Whenever you come here, I fear that they'll recognize you. If something ever happens to you... I... If it weren't for you, I would've just killed them and myself. If it weren't for you... My place of death... ...my grave... ...is you, So-yeon. Please, stop your revenge now. I know KANG was unjustly killed, so I'll re-investigate, punish those responsible and rehabilitate those who died on false charges. The son will uncover his father's guilt? Don't shoot! Wait, listen to me! My lord! Stop! After seeing a loved one killed, anyone would want to commit murder. But if you don't reveal this injustice... You are filled with words! I'm merely repeating the acts of your father. If you insist on trying to kill that man, I'll be forced to shoot you. Don't you know he must die for this to end? If you continue on like this, what about the villagers who turned away from KANG? Will you kill all of them too? Do you think they can live at peace with their bloodstained hands? KANG will have his way with them. That's not so. KANG's ghost is an apparition made out of craving for revenge. Don't project private cravings for revenge onto a ghost. You still don't know why you came to this island? My task is to rip apart that dirty beast, to burn down this mill and return it to KANG. Even if I don't kill him, he can never leave this island alive. Leave this island together with me. I'll help you reveal what happened 7 years ago. If I've really been summoned here by KANG's ghost, it's for this reason. An inquisitor driven by ambition kills an innocent family, and now his son is going to assist me? KIM Chi-seong, to acquire the paper mill, conspired together with the inquisitor. Then shoot me. You know what your father spread for sake of his ambition? Disgrace. Is a man without shame even human? Hold your tongue! Beast. Shoot me and live like your father, hiding your shame with brutality. What are you doing? Step back! My lord. Please yield Doo-ho to us. KANG's spirit will only rest after Doo-ho is dead. When KANG was accused, you ignored him for small debts. Now you seek his forgiveness with another man's life. Stand aside! My lord, please yield him to us. Give us Doo-ho! Give him to us! Take him away. Yes, sir. Stop this now! KIM Chi-seong is still alive. KIM Chi-seong? Let's go!
