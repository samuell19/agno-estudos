♪♪ On October 28th, 1981, a Soviet submarine ran aground inside Swedish territorial waters near the top-secret naval base of Karlskrona. Suddenly, Sweden found herself thrust in to the superpower conflict. Foreign submarines frequently violate Swedish waters, but so far, the Navy has failed to catch a single intruder. The hundreds of American and Soviet submarines hidden beneath the world's oceans and armed with nuclear missiles are today's most powerful weapons simply because they are almost impossible to detect. On April 9th, 1984, a revolutionary submarine search device was secretly tested near Stockholm for top American and Swedish officials. [ Whistles ] Sir. Good morning. Everything ready? Of course. Good. Minister. Good morning. Let me give you a hand. Uh, it's okay. Diving. Diving angle, 15 degrees. Take it down to two-zero meters. Fifteen degrees, two-zero meters. Gentlemen, it is rather timely that we should be testing this prototype today, since Sweden is currently living through another red alert while our Navy are searching for an unidentified submarine lurking in our territorial waters. Perhaps your laser will discover what our combined forces have so far failed to find. Well, no promises. This is the heartbeat of the operation. A green laser rod with a 26% efficiency. This laser rod will sustain two and half kilowatt of output power of green light, which is ten times more power than any known existing laser of the same kind. [ Beeping ] The laser is now scanning in a horizontal plane at a depth of 120 meters. You can see on the monitor what the laser senses. [ Beeping continues ] I'll be damned. You found a submarine. Latitude, north 59, 20 minutes, longitude, east 90, 10 minutes. That's, uh, here. Congratulations, both of you. Well, it's Mr. Mandell who has the brains. I write the brief. Jesus, Baxter, what did you do that for? Take it easy. Yeah, we use these gas tubes here. Grab that laser over there. You're crazy, Baxter. Relax. We got plenty of time. We have two whole minutes. Let's move it. ♪♪ [ Explosion ] [ Tires screech ] [ Explosions continue ] [ Siren ] Mr. Mandell? Yes. Larsson, Military Intelligence. This is totally senseless. Sorry? If they wanted the laser, why not just steal it? So you think I should be investigating a theft rather than an explosion? Well, yes, I think so. Mr. Mandell, um, don't you have plans, data, blueprints? Couldn't you just make another one? Mr. Larsson, this was a factory. Once. Of course, I could make another one to the tune of six months' work and about ten million dollars. [ Whistles ] Are we talking about terrorists? No, too sophisticated a device for terrorists. MAN: Mr. Mandell! Yes. Come over here, please. Mr. Larsson. Mr. Miller. Did you get your balls chewed up by the Defense Minister yet? You tell it on me. I'm still intact. Not for long. You realize that that, uh, laser puts us two years ahead of the Russians, and you realize what the implications of that is in the balance of power in the whole East and West. The Russians have based their whole military strategy on submarine fleet. But if we know with absolute precision where they are... I'm just looking at the gate. Gate? What gate for Christ's sake?

How many people work here? 250, approximately. They all have top, uh, security clearance. Oh, they always have. You know, I wanna be kept informed about the progress of your investigation, because I know that Military Intelligence makes up their own... Mr. Miller, there are no secrets in Sweden. Secrets are forbidden by law. You will be informed. We are investigating an inside job. Therefore, we need somebody on the... Inside. That's right, close to Mandell. Makes sense. I want somebody as close as that to Mandell. Like Blom, his driver? Well, we'll check on the computer. The world's survival depends on the bloody computer.

I want your name and your paper. Listen, I'm very sorry about the whole... The man's name is Blom, B-L-O-M. Yes, hard drugs, yes. My information is that his apartment would be well worth searching. Freeze! What the hell is going on here? Shut up! Jon. Yeah? And you, come out. That is not my stuff. Get your trousers on. You're nicked! Hey, uh, they must know something. Why arrest him? Oh, Jesus Christ, there could be hundreds of reasons, jaywalking... Oh, come on, you should know better than that. Perhaps maybe he didn't pay his taxes. All right, let us say Blom was arrested by ordinary police. But I guarantee you, Larsson is behind it. He is playing games. Oh, wait and see. No, we cannot afford that luxury. I mean, two people have gotten killed already, the whole thing's a... Those things happen. It was supposed to be a simple break-in. Okay, okay. I'll go to my friend Stig Larsson. I'll say nicely and politely, "Why was Blom arrested?" You worry too much. You're in good hands. Yours? I like to think ours. Should we talk to him? Blom? I don't know. No, I don't think so. He's done his job, made space for us to fill. I come bearing gifts, more than you bastards deserve, compliments of the United States Government. All of our information agencies, these are the sort of people that might steal a laser prototype. Russians? Russians, Arabs, South Africans, Chinese, diverse elements inside the third-world itself. And why are we "bastards"? Mandell's driver was arrested. Why wasn't I informed? I haven't arrested anybody. Do you recall arresting anybody? Maybe the police. They arrest people. Well, I need it checked out. I'll look into it. When? All right. Who do I ask questions here to get some answers around here? Check with me. I'm in charge of the investigation. You'll find me very cooperative. How long has your boss been stone-deaf? I'm sorry? What do you think about Mandell's security? I think it stinks. You told him so? Yeah, I told him. I got a Swedish answer. Democracy, open government, nobody has any secrets. Nobody has any secrets, nobody needs, uh, security. Now, when that's explained to me, it almost makes sense, but, uh, when I say it, it sure as hell doesn't make a lot of sense. And, Mr. Miller? It upsets the computer. That's another thing. A guy can't smoke, he can't drink. This life is killing me. Are these some of the subs you found, Stig? Well, uh, we look for them. We rarely find them. A Swedish tradition.
