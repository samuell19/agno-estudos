Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. When India gained independence, I was posted in Gurgaon to control the civil unrest. That's when we were informed that Kashmir was under attack by militants. The Sikh regiment was flown down to Srinagar overnight. Through various operations, we started taking back control of the areas occupied by them. Even I was involved in one such dangerous operation. Let's go. Come on. Come on! Spread everywhere! Take your positions! Go over there! Move ahead. Keep moving ahead! Soldiers... Somebody save my daughter! Please help! Move ahead. Cover him! Run! Come on, run! Run! They are coming near! Run for your life! Hold this! Well done! You're quite brave, Brother-in-law. You play with death. When it's about the security of the country, a soldier has to befriend death. Do you get it? You are right. A country can't be safe without an army. Go to sleep now. He is here for another month. There's ample time to hear such stories. Drink milk and go to sleep. You all have to go harvesting tomorrow. You're here to help harvest the fields. Don't get us embarrassed. She's right. Let's sleep. We must at least harvest three fields tomorrow. You should sleep too. I'm not coming. I can't sleep without dad. Even I can't sleep without my child. I'll sleep with her. -What do you think? -Yes! Come on, boys. Have enough milk. I don't want anyone complaining of being tired in the morning. No, Brother. We'll give it our best tomorrow. We won't let you win. We'll see who wins in the morning. What do you think? Guys, last night you were saying you'll give in your best! Are you already drained out? It's just afternoon. We make sure to finish harvesting by evening. Sister-in-law is here. Let's eat first and then work. We'll then show him how it's done. Come on! Let's eat first. Come on! Let's eat. Come here, Uncle. Come on, let's have food. Wait a minute! I'll serve you all. Hey! Hey! At least enjoy your meal in peace. This is what we all work so hard for. I couldn't handle my hunger. We've been really slogging it out since morning. Let me also know what you've achieved. Eat like human beings. Or else, Gurdayal, you won't give them food. Come on, let's have it. Where's your discipline? What's does "discipline" mean, Joginder? It means nothing to you. Go, eat. Idiot! -Serve me the food. -Come on, have it. Have it, dear. Here you go. What's the matter, Brother? Why are you eating so slowly? You should take time to chew your food. It increases blood count. You all took so long to eat. Come on, let's get back to work. -Come along. -Coming, Uncle. Come on now. Have it. Please eat, Sister-in-law. Oh, no! Chew properly! It increases your blood count. Of course! She'll chew well. Let's go. Come on, have it. Brother, an announcement was made on the radio that all the soldiers' leaves have been canceled. They've been called back on duty! This is All India Radio, Delhi. Today's headlines. The Government of India has decided to deploy the army on the North-Eastern border in response to the ever increasing disturbance by Chinese forces. The Prime Minister of India, Mr. Jawahar Lal Nehru has appealed to all the soldiers on leave, to cancel them and report back to their headquarters. And also inform your officer in charge. Victory to India! With that, we come to the end of this news bulletin. Brother, what could it be? Dad, will you... They need to go since they've been called by the government. Here you go. Give him the food. Serve it in a plate. I am coming. Here, my son, have some. Remember this when you're at war. You can repay a mother for her nurturing, but you can't ever repay the motherland. Son, promise me you'll protect the motherland till your last breath. Remember the sacrifices of our Gurus. Don't give up. Don't worry, Mother. Joginder does not falter. Live long, dear. Can't you go later? What are you saying, Gurdayal? Is this the first time I'm going for a war? I've gone so many times. It was different then. It was just the two of us then. Now we have responsibilities. Think about our children. I am going for the sake of many others like them. Someone has to protect our borders. Be grateful to the Lord, for having chosen his disciple for such a noble job. May the Lord keep you safe. I'm getting all kinds of bad thoughts. God will take care of everything. See me off with a smile. Bless you, Son. Do well, my dear. Dad. Yes, my princess. What's this? When you are away, I'll sleep with grandma. But, how will you sleep without me? So, please take my favorite doll with you. Whenever you sleep, keep her with you. You'll get a sound sleep. Soldiers, the neighbors, who we've considered friends, and had amicable relations with... have been infiltrating our borders since the past few months attacking the nearby villages and killing innocent people. Despite Prime Minister, Jawahar Lal Nehru's efforts, our enemy aren't backing off. It doesn't seem that the issue can be resolved peacefully any more. So soldiers, be prepared. It's time to teach our enemy a befitting lesson! Soldiers, our country has always been a peace loving nation. But, it doesn't mean that the enemy can take an undue advantage. We'll never let it happen! We are determined to win or die trying to save our country! How will you sleep without me? Please take my favorite doll with you. Soldiers, it's time to teach our enemy a lesson! The Sikh regiment soldiers can happily sacrifice their lives for our country, but can never let the enemy succeed in their foul play. I promise, as long as Subedar Joginder Singh and his troop are alive the enemy cannot set foot on our motherland till the last bullet! Guru Gobind Singh has said, "If your enemy compels you and leaves you with no other option, then it is right to pick the sword." "When everything has been tried, yet justice is not in sight. It is then the right time to pick up the sword and fight!" Victory, in the name of the Lord! The Lord, the ultimate truth. Maan Singh, the demarcation line between the two mountains is called Mc Mahon Line. The troops of the Assam Rifles are keeping a watch on the enemy from there. Remember, Maan Singh the Assam Rifles troop can only keep a watch on the enemy. If the enemy makes a move, Joginder Singh and his post will be the first in the line of fire. You know that Joginder Singh is the most experienced and brave soldier from our regiment. With him there, no one can breach his post and move forward. We always thought that after Tibet was free, we wouldn't have to give up this area to India. But, we're good friends with India. India has severed that friendship by sheltering our enemy, Dalai Lama. You know that India is chanting slogans of our brotherhood. Let India remain under this illusion. We have to fulfill our goal. Come here and collect your letters. Have I got a letter? In Santokh Singh's name? -My mother's letter would've come. -Easy, guys. Take your letters. Come and collect it. What about my letter? Give it to me. Is this your final decision? Then, hear me out. I consider you dead for me. Get out of my sight! What's the matter, buddy? I've noticed that whenever the letters come, you become sad. What's the matter? Nothing as such. Listen up. Amidst these barren mountains, we only have each other to share our sorrows with. Nothing great. My exam results came and I passed in the first division. I was excited to tell my father. Father! Father! I passed! Great news! Good job! -Brother, did you pass? -Yes, Sister. -Mom, bless me. -May God bless you, my dear. Son. I'm very happy for you. Go to Firozpur tomorrow and fill in a form. But, Father... I want to go to England to study further. You already know that every man in this family after his education, serves the country by joining in the army. But, Father, I don't want to join the army! If this is your final decision, then hear me out. I consider you dead for me. Get out of my sight! I was about to go abroad. But I thought, how could I remain happy upsetting my father? Hence, I enrolled in the army. After my training, I got posted here. You fulfilled your father's dream. Now, what's the problem? The problem is that it was the first time I argued with my father. I was so ashamed that I couldn't face him. Bahadur Singh, you never wanted your father to be unhappy. But, he's still unhappy. Write to him that his boy has enrolled in the army. As soon as he reads the letter, he will be filled with pride. Hey, Bahadur! Hey, Saudagar! Catch Ajaib Singh! Catch him! Catch him! Leave me! Catch him. Please let me go! -Take this! -Let me read... Give me my letter back. Listen up! Fresh off the press! If you read my letter any further, I'll shoot you! You can shoot me with a cannon, but I'll still read your letter. -Go on. Read it. -Listen. My love, we're married now but I still haven't seen your face. Even the barber is luckier than me. He's at least seen your face. Give me my letter... Let's see sister-in-law's photograph. Wait, there's more. My younger sister was saying that you have green cat-like eyes. Whenever a cat comes and messes the utensils, she teases me by calling it brother-in-law. What's so funny? The cat! Please! I beg you! -Don't read any further. -Read it. Soldiers! My respect, sir! What's happening here? Sir, Baba, Balbir and Bahadur, these three fools always read my love letters and make fun of me in front of everyone! Never make fun of anyone's love. What do you know of love? We don't. Please tell us. Son... the moneylender has taken possession of our land as well. They don't even let me enter. Come back soon, Son. Sir, soldiers are deployed all around. Okay. But still, be very alert. Yes, sir. Who's letter is it? Tears in Nayak Santokh Singh's eyes? Baba Singh! Life is always full of joys and sorrows. It's a letter from my mother. A mother's letter brings joy. But you look sad. Sir, I had to pawn my land for my father's treatment. And I could not release it. Don't lose heart over a land. It's not about the land. It's about my father's grave on that land. I couldn't return the money, hence they took over the land. They don't even let my mother light a lamp on his grave. Subedar Joginder Singh is like your elder brother. If you need money, take my salary for a month or two. Thank you, sir. But, I'll save my salary and repay my debt. Sir, the tap at my home is damaged too. -If I could get half a month's salary... -Baba Singh! It's alright. We'll pull buckets from the well. Keep faith, soldier. And write to your mother. The Lord will take care of everything. Oh, Lord! Swaran, what's the matter? Why do you look so worried? -A lion. -A lion? I swear I heard a lion roar. I may survive the Chinese but I think this lion will eat me alive. There's no lion in this area. I think those three idiots are making you one. -What? -A buffoon. They trouble me too. Forget that. But, tell me, why are you so scared? To tell you the truth, I joined the army because all my friends were doing so. I didn't know I'd be surrounded by death. Listen to me! Try to overcome your fear. The more you get scared, the more your fear will increase. Be a brave soldier. What happened? I came to give your radio. You forgot it there. Listen to the news. I've heard there's a lion in the area. I don't see Baba Singh anywhere. He's gone to the base camp. -Soldiers! -Yes, sir! -Cleaning up well? -Yes, sir. Keep at it. Yes, sir. Tear down the bunker and trenches or the Chinese will kill you. Tashi, what's this old man saying? The old man is asking us to break down the bunker or we will all be killed. There's no need to worry as long as we are here. Please don't construct a bunker here, sir. The Chinese soldiers consider this as their area. They're lying. This area belongs to India. But, when we tell this to the Chinese soldiers, they get furious. Son, you don't know how terrifying they are. They're very cruel. Once a child from my village made a small wall of stones to play with. They couldn't tolerate even that. They thought it to be a ploy. The next day they came to our village and... Don't worry. The government has sent us here to protect you. Okay. Hurry! Move! This land belongs to us. If you don't want to die at Commander Pong's hands, go back. Commander Pong. Even history is witness, that wherever the Sikh regiment is posted, even death has to change its course. Our gurus have taught us, neither take what's rightfully someone else's nor let anyone seize what's ours. "One who neither frightens anyone, nor is afraid of anyone." Victory, in the name of the Lord! The Lord, the ultimate truth! Indians and Chinese, are brothers. Were there any casualties? Sir, do you have any orders for me if this happens again? You have to stay alert and keep an eye on the enemy's activity. In case of any casualty during your patrol, you know what you need to do. Sir, I've learnt from you. Never let the enemy leave alive from our area. Sir, the enemy has fired at Joginder Singh's post. Delta Tiger, you must gauge them now. Greetings, sir! That's strange. He didn't hear me. Greetings, sir! Sir, have you considered my request? Shut up. Stop repeating the same thing. How did the Chinese cross the Mc Mahon Line? This is a grave situation. Sir, that's why I request you to grant me permission to go patrolling in the enemy's area. That too, during the day. So that we get correct information about their position and power. No. I know you have more war experience than I do but not just me, even the Commanding Officer will not give you the permission to go there. But Joginder is right, sir. The Chinese army crossing our border in broad daylight, proves their dangerous intentions. No, Joginder Singh. I cannot give you the permission to go there and risk your life. Sir, don't worry about my life. This information is important for the country, not Joginder Singh. But, no. But, you must give it a try, sir. After all, the country's security depends on it. No. It's impossible. I cannot allow such risky patrolling. Joginder Singh is an emotional soldier. And I respect his sentiments. But, no soldier returns alive after patrolling in the day. Sir, Joginder Singh knows what he's saying. He's ready to take this risk for the country. Such orders can be passed only during a war or extreme circumstances. The enemy is misusing our friendship to attack us in broad daylight while we're chanting slogans of brotherhood. What could be worse, sir? The country we trusted, has stabbed us in our back. Sir, this patrolling can help us collect important information about the enemy's plan and their location. During such a patrol, God forbid, if there's any casualty, it can impact the morale of our company. Sir, you can count on Joginder Singh. He'll return successful from this patrol mission. How can you be so sure? During the Burma War, he's carried out even more dangerous operations with me. Come here quickly! Get me the medical kit! Get it quickly! Hurry up! Joginder, go get him some water. Go. Here, have some water. Have it. Sir, do we take that as a yes? Santokh Singh, how many are left? Only 12 remaining. -Report to the headquarters immediately. -Yes, sir. Greetings, sir! Sir, did you hear that the government doesn't have any bullets. We're cleaning our guns unnecessarily. Think about it. If you don't have any bullets how will you fight the Chinese? Not "you" but "we". Yes, sir! You can look into it. How did you find out? Heard it on the news. -Santokh Singh, confiscate this. -Yes, sir. -Sir, but it's not a tiny matter. -Don't you dare! If you ever repeat such a cowardly act at my post, you may even face a court martial. I just heard it on the radio-- -Santokh Singh! -Yes, sir. Swaran Singh will run with his backpack for an hour. -Okay, sir. -How am I at fault? I was just... Make that two hours. Come, shall we go or you want to increase it by another hour? Give me the mirror. I want to tie my turban. I'm tying my turban, too. I am not looking at the Chinese border through it. I'll be late. I need to be on duty now. Your lovingly, Ajaib. Hey! Let go of me. Baba, I'll tell sir. You can tell sir while I'll tell everyone. Return my letter. Have some shame. My sweet darling. Sweetheart, I've only seen your trembling hands. I don't know when that day will arrive when you will get me a glass of milk with your delicate hands. I'll shoot you. Now, I even see you in the bullets, guns and bombs. I will not spare you! I even see you in my fair complexioned friend, Saudagar. I swear to God, I never wrote that! Hey, Ajaib... Come on, run! Let me go! Hey... -Yes, sir! -Victory to India, sir! -Stand up! -Okay, sir! Despite coming from the same town you all are fighting like kids. Is that how of Subedar Joginder Singh's platoon behaves? You should be ashamed of yourselves! Sir, how can one read someone's love letter in public? It's so embarrassing. As if you're... As if you're... Naked? Exactly! Ajaib Singh, a brave soldier is one who can bare his heart in front of everyone. Sir, there are some matters which you can't share with everyone. Such as? Dirty talks, sir. Tell me. The matters of the heart. Matters of the... Baba Singh. The matters of the heart? At the border? Fool, it's easiest to express your feelings. How is that so? Why fear to speak your heart? He gets scared How will you fight at the border? Why fear to speak your heart? How will you fight at the border? Tell me, my friend What are you secretly reading? What are you secretly reading? What are you secretly reading? Letters Oh, these letters The letters come They make us wait so much It gives immense joy They comfort us too The letters come They make us wait so much It gives immense joy They comfort us too The letters come They make us wait so much I dream of a wedding The bangles of my newly wed wife I dream of the path Where she awaits The paths of my town The paths of my town The mother who cascades Encouraging words, before goodbyes And showers her blessings And showers her blessings Father's caution Encourages us Letters...

We love our country! Listen up Listen up What's being said? We love our country! Listen up Come on in. Baba Singh, what's the matter? Tell me. -Tell him. -Tell him. Sir, everyone's saying that you've heard all our stories. But, you haven't said anything. You've to tell us today. How did you get married to sister-in-law? Yes, sir! You have to. After all, how did you get married to sister-in-law? Tell us, sir. Sir, everyone's saying that you fell in love before you got married... Who says so? Well, I said it. Sir, please tell us. Okay. It was 17 years ago. We won against Burma in second world war. I was ecstatic. As soon as I was granted leave, I took the Delhi-Lahore Express to go to my village. I wanted to share my joy of our victory with father. But the train journey seemed never ending. Sister, come fast. Is there anyone here who can help this old lady? My luggage is quite heavy. I got it, ma'am. Thank you, son. Bless you, child. May the Lord bless you with good health. Live long! The beauty of your eyes Has mesmerized me You have gained A special place in my heart Your simplicity Has created a havoc Has torn up My heart Your gaze Is incomparable It hits straight To my heart Your love has Such a power That a courageous man Is daunted In front of you What do our eyes Tell each other?

What do our eyes Tell each other I have lost my sleep Because of your love What do our eyes Tell each other Bachattar, what's with Joginder? Where are you lost, soldier? You've reached home. Don't shoot. That's your father standing in front of you. Son. Son. -Mother! -Come. -Father. -May God bless you. Mother. I'll sacrifice my life for my dear. Sister, why are you crying? Joginder Singh has made our village so proud. Come on in. Come, now. Virender Singh, this last one is for you. -Mother, see how lovely this is. -It's so beautiful. What's the matter with you, Prito? You didn't get anything for the three of us? We're not going to wear old rags for the festival. We are really upset with you. Don't talk to us! Don't worry. Next time I'll bring you two sets of clothes each. -Is that fine? -That's a good idea. Everyone's got something, but nothing for us! -Give them... -I got... Hey, whose clothes are these in my bag? Girls, look. Are they yours? Give it, Brother. Okay. Wait! This is for Prito. This one's for Phino. And this, for Bhajno. Why did you trouble us? Such a pretty dress. Isn't it? Come, give me a hug. -Go and play. -Let's go. You always find happiness in others' joy. Mom, you and dad have always taught me a true Sikh is one who makes others happy. I wish you eternal success, my son. What do our eyes Tell each other What do our eyes Tell each other I have lost my sleep Because of your love Come on, everyone get on. Put this bundle away, will you? Mother, please apply Kohl in my eyes. Wait a minute. Give it to me. Take it. -It's done. -Okay. Mom, why don't dad and you come along with us to the fair? What will we do there? All of you can and enjoy yourselves to the fullest. Okay, Dad. I'll leave then, Mom. Wait! Let me put a black dot on you, too. The whole village is singing praises of your bravery. Let no evil eye be cast upon Joginder. Mother, put a black dot on me, too. I'm no less handsome. Here you go. -What do you think? -See you, Mom!

Where were you? Let's go. It's the harvest month. We won't be able to organize a wedding. It's a busy season and we won't be able to call everyone. No! Joginder has come for leave. We have to get him married before he goes back. She is right. It is better to get them married now. Can I get my cannon for you the next time? Joginder's here. -Greetings. -Greetings. Don't just greet him. Take his blessings. He's your father-in-law. We've fixed your alliance with his daughter, Gurdayal. Uncle's words splintered my heart. Come on! Go! Hands up! Stop! Stop! Bahadur Singh. If you dare to cross the border again Subedar Joginder Singh won't let you leave the Indian soil alive. I'm forgiving you considering this your last mistake. But, remember, we have Punjabi blood running in our veins. When it's a matter of our nation, we don't wait for orders. We'll blow your heads off! Get going. Move it! The enemy is constantly crossing the border and attacking Joginder Singh's post number 11. They might even be taking position near the Mc Mahon Line, and strengthening their forces. Haripal Kaushik. We have to immediately gauge the enemy's position and powers Sir, as we had requested earlier, this job can only be done by patrolling enemy territory. Sir, I request you... I'll speak to the headquarters about patrolling. But we've to be careful about one thing. Until we receive orders, there must be no enemy casualty. Sir, do we wait for the enemies to shoot us? I understand your situation very well. But until we get orders from the government to open fire, you'll have to bear with it. Everything alright, Santokh Singh? Until I don't get the orders to blow the heads of the enemy, nothing's going to be alright, sir. I respect your spirit, Santokh Singh. But, my hands are tied. As soon as I receive orders to open fire at the enemy, I swear by the Lord, Joginder Singh's unit will decimate the enemy. Truth, in the name of Lord. Lord, our true king. Keep your blessings with us, Lord. You wretched Chinese! Come out! It's because of you... It's because of you, I don't get leave. He keeps saying the same thing! "Fight these Chinese first. Then, you can meet your bride." Enough, now! If the Chinese hear your rant, their first bullet will be shot on my head. Nothing will happen to you. -You hear me? -I think he'll get us killed. -Get out! -Lord, keep us safe. You don't even know what it's like to bring your wife home! Are you so shameless? You rascals, come out. Sir, Ajaib Singh. Shall I call him? Bahadur Singh. -Sir? -Bring him. Yes, sir. What do you know of our wedding customs? You burst all the fireworks even before Diwali. Please fight with us! I, Ajaib Singh is waiting for you! Come out! Get him down. -Ajaib Singh... -Yes. This has become an everyday thing now. Sir has been hearing all this for an hour now. He has called for you. You are going to do some more rounds of punishment. I'm in trouble now because of you! Come on. What did he say? Am I going to get punished? Sir, please punish him. Ajaib Singh, how many times do I have to explain to you? I can't grant you leave under these circumstances. Look me in the eye and speak, Ajaib Singh. Sir, everyone makes fun of me. No one knows how I feel. I'm waiting for the Chinese here, and my new bride is waiting for me at home. I'm stuck, sir. But, forget that, sir. No one can understand my feelings. Shall we plaster your heart with cement? Baba Singh! Ajaib Singh, don't worry. I understand your pain very well. Don't you know, the same thing happened to sir. He was in love with someone, but his father forced him to marry someone else. Baba Singh, don't talk nonsense. Take your positions. For us, your story's still a mystery. Why don't you tell us what happened finally? Bahadur Singh! Please tell your story, sir. It's possible that listening to your story might make me feel better. It's nothing about a girl, Uncle. Buddy... What happened? -Sit. -What happened? Don't pull out my arm. My life's at stake and you're worried about your arm. Promise me that you won't tell anyone. I won't tell anyone. We're in a big dilemma. You are a very sly man. Oh my God, Sister! You've brought disgrace to father. Don't scare me. What should I do? There's nothing we can do. You'll get married tomorrow. And in a year, you'll have a son. A son? How can that happen? I won't marry. That's it! Your father will thrash you with his shoes. Just keep mum! There isn't much that you've to forget about him. You don't even know his name. -Nipa! -Coming, Aunt. -Come fast. -You'll land me in trouble, too. It would be worth trying if you knew anything about her. You don't even know where she's from. Why are you getting so worked up? Wasting my time! Bachattar, aren't you my friend? Don't just invite your friend. I've bought new clothes for your wedding reception, too. Don't forget me. I'll take you for the wedding, too. I'll even take you for war. What do we do? Nothing. I didn't hear a thing. Quick. Quick. Greetings, everyone. Greetings. Come on, young man. Take his blessings. Come on. Go and meet them. Bless you. Be happy. Here, some sweets. -Hope everything is alright. -Thank you. All the guests are eating. And my to be brother-in-law is sitting hungry. I've made these flatbread myself. I'm not hungry. Oh, your love for our sister has already killed your hunger. Save some love for the sisters-in-law, too. I would love to eat what you've cooked, but I feel you're up to some mischief. Who's even talking to you? Who's feeding you? No matter who eats it's the same thing. There is no comparison between you and our brother-in-law. You look like you are always hungry. Feeding the hungry is a noble task. Is it? Fine. Here you go, then. Let's have it. She has given it with love. Eat it. Isn't it delicious? Your sisters-in-law are no less. Watch out for them over the next three days! Since the day I've fixed her wedding, Gurdayal seems to be very sad. Well, you've found a lovely match for her. He serves the British army. Gets a good salary, too. Mom. Why don't you tell her all this? Her sadness will vanish. No way. Who tells a girl these things? She doesn't need to know about the boy and his work details. Look at this, how pretty it is. Here, eat something. Come on girls, go to sleep. Enough dancing. You have to wake up early tomorrow. You have to be up early. See? Brother, it's not something that you've lost just once. You've lost it twice. Once in the train and then at the fair. That girl's not for you. This is the girl in your destiny. However she is, I'm sure she'll be just fine. Can't you keep this to yourself? What could I do? I thought you'd run away. Brother, please don't even think of running away. Father's dignity is at stake. Look at those girls near the well. Is it appropriate for me to checkout the girls? If someone sees us, all the guests will get beaten up. How will dad explain as to how everyone got beaten up? Have an answer to that? Look at that girl in the turquoise scarf. She's so pretty. Like the moon. Her teeth shine like pearls. Her eyes are like a doe's. Her cheeks, red as tomatoes. Isn't it? Don't stare at Joginder's sister-in-law. I think the truth is something else. Brother, it's not what you think. I was just... I was just trying to prove to Joginder that if the younger sister is so beautiful, imagine how gorgeous the older one will be. You're younger than me. So, behave well. Don't try to teach me. She always brightens up a wedding home. What happened to you, dear? Go, give this to your aunt. Instead of helping me out, you've spread the news across the village. I haven't told anything to anyone. Besides, he's your brother. -He is younger than me. -When did I say he's elder? These matters are discussed with the elders, not the young ones. But, how will you know that? Bloody fool. I feel like punishing you and have you court marshaled. I'm sorry. I was only trying to save your family honor. Rubbish! Such indiscipline. You need to follow some rules. Listen, Bachattar. It's wrong to peep into someone's house. Joginder, look. What a heavenly sight! -Don't be crazy. -Come here. Oh, no. Save us! Trouble is here. Are you slyly seeing my sister? I don't know about your village, but here, peeping is considered an offense. What are you saying? I was just... Bachattar is calling me. Yes, Bachattar, I'm coming... Brother-in-law, remember one thing. People out here come to know everything. Don't just keep staring at it. Brother-in-law, find the gold. Or will you first sing us a song? Look at these girls troubling the groom. Let him be. Let the girls spend time with their brother-in-law. They won't get such a chance again. Is the day starting or getting over? Get ready to see your daughter off. Come on. Get up. We won't spare brother-in-law. Not until he finds the gold from this vessel. Brother-in-law, can I talk to you? Tell me. Not in front of these idiots. Can we talk over there? Go ahead. Now that you are married to my sister, we've formed a relationship for life. In spite of my family forbidding me, I can't hide the truth from you. What is it? Promise me first that you will say nothing to my sister. I won't. My sister doesn't look like me at all. Actually, she doesn't look like anyone in the family. Her complexion is quite dark. She also has buckteeth. But, honestly, she's very talented... Enough. Everything has happened by God's will. Bachattar, this is a beautiful village. I feel like coming here again and again. Shall I ask your father to get you married off next week to Bachan Kaur? The whole family is afflicted with love! The younger one wants to follow the soldier's footsteps. -Congratulations! -Congratulations to you, too! Come, let's go. Brother, let's go. My goodness! So beautiful! Here, have some sweets. Mother, come fast. Brother is here with his wife. Sister-in-law, say something. Our sister-in-law is pretty but very quiet. She hasn't said a word since she's come. I hope sister-in-law's not mute. Come on, girls, go to sleep. Let your sister-in-law rest, too. She must be very tired. -Brother, listen up. -What is it? Is Joginder with you? No. What happened? I can't find him. -I think he has flown away. -What will we do now? What do we tell everyone? Your father will get humiliated. How will I marry Bachan now? You better forget about getting married. They'll have to think about this girl, too. I'm sure they will get her married to you. Bachattar, I can't live without Bachan anymore. Don't worry, my friend. If the younger one is fair, the older one must be peaches and cream. If the younger one is doe-eyed, the older one must be the same. If the younger one is fire, the older one must be a firecracker! Please spare me. I'll get you my brother's gun. Just shoot me. Joginder. -It's not required now. -It is! You haven't gone to your room yet? I'll take you inside. Aunt, I... Aunt... You got saved. I'll take him. Don't waste time talking. It's time to close the gates. Go to your room. Don't hesitate. Latch it from inside. My sister doesn't look like me at all. Actually, she doesn't look like anyone in the family. Her complexion is quite dark. She also has buckteeth. Greetings! Before leaving, my mother told me that if I wanted a happy life, I shouldn't keep any secrets from my husband. Now that we are married, you mean the world to me. That's why, I wanted to share something personal with you. If I don't, it'll be a sin. A few days ago, I was going by train to my grandparents' house. I saw a very handsome man there. And I felt as though the Lord had made him for me. That's the last thing I needed. Since then, I've been dreaming of a life with him. Then one day at the fair, he appeared before me out of nowhere in a maroon outfit. Then he vanished. We've never spoken to each other. If I'm lying, I'll turn to ashes right away. Are you saying that you would've been happier if you'd married that guy? Yes, I'd definitely be happier if I married him. But now, it's a sin to even think about it. And, what if you meet him again? God forbid! I won't even look at another man now. Don't do that. You never know, your dream man and I might turn out to be the same person. Oh God! Sir, you're very lucky. Sir, God has answered your prayers. Greetings, sir! We'll not spare them. Joginder Singh, your request has been approved. You've got permission for patrolling. This operation will have a team of seven. -Joginder Singh. -Sir. -You'll lead the team. -Yes, sir. Remember, this is a very dangerous operation. You won't find a place to hide during the day. Carelessness can cost a life. It's because we don't know where exactly the enemy are hiding. Don't worry, sir. Joginder Singh very well knows to dodge the enemy and get the information. Please explain the plan. Sir, we're here. This is the Bumla border. According to the area expert, this is the best route. Because it's least risky. Sir, there's another route. It's long enough but the enemy won't be able to spot you. This is the route. Maan Singh, we shouldn't ignore his input. Yes, sir. -Joginder Singh. -Sir! Sir, they are right next to the Mc Mahon Line. They are three times more than us. The Sikh regiment doesn't bother about the number of people while fighting. Stay alert! Sir, the officer at the opposite post seems very sharp. We've been informed that they've just patrolled our area. How many soldiers are they in total? Around 25 soldiers. Pong, we're in thousands. We can't change our plan because of one sharp officer. We have to capture this post to takeover Tawang. Okay, sir. Sir, according to Joginder Singh's report, the enemy is preparing to attack from the Mc Mahon Line. I don't trust the enemy's intentions, sir. In case of an attack, Joginder Singh's post number 11 will require ammunition. I request you to immediately make all the arrangements. All right. I'll submit my report to the headquarters and arrange for the ammunition. Order all your troops to stay alert. Yes, sir! -Soldiers. -Yes, sir! Today, none of the trenches in our area should be empty. While keeping an eye on the enemy, every soldier should always keep a weapon along! Everyone should be alert! -Any doubts? -No, sir. Bahadur Singh! Bahadur Singh! Here's a letter for you. Isn't it from your father. Dad's asking me to come and meet him quickly. That's a great news. The enemy can make a move any moment. We'll need the ammunition. Please send it as soon as possible, sir. Yes, sir. Sir, you've never responded to any of my requests yet. Every solider has a story to tell. But my father has no story. The whole village taunts my father by calling him a sentry in the army. When I go home to my village, everyone taunts me by calling me a "little watchman". Sir, only you can help me by sending me on the front lines of war. -Do you have anything else to say? -No, sir! So, you can get back on your duty. Okay, sir! Even after giving money which you sent me to the moneylender he is saying that he won't let me light a lamp at your father's grave until you sign the documents. Come as soon as possible. We'll go together and light the lamp at your father's grave. Her name is always on your lips. Thinking of our sister-in-law, He keeps looking for her In his heart. He keeps looking for her In his heart. If a man doesn't get to have his nuptial night then every day seems like an eternity. Sit down. Why are you always simmering in frustration? You are always joking. -We've got a solution for your misery. -Yes. How did sir's brother describe his sister-in-law? How did he say her face was? Like a moon. And, what about her eyes? Like a doe. Her cheeks? Like tomatoes. What did her teeth look like? Like pearls! Oh, boy! Sister-in-law seems to be very pretty. Oh, wow! She looks beautiful. Look properly, Ajaib Singh. For now, you'll have to make do with this photo. The way things are going on, I don't think you'll get a leave. -All well, boys? -Yes, sir! -Ajaib Singh! -Yes, sir? Pack your bags. Your leave has been sanctioned. Sir, is my leave actually sanctioned? With sweets prepared for me My pretty wife will be Waiting for me. Ajaib. Please convey my message to my father. Tell him that his son looks very handsome in the uniform. Definitely, Brother. If you get the time, please visit my village as well. Brother, I'll be back real quick. I'm only going to see her face. Let it be. You won't come back so soon. -We know how it works. -No way. Ajaib, my village is very close to your village, too. If you get some time, please tell my mother that her son will come home soon. I'll surely tell her. Baba Singh, don't you want to send any message? Your village is close to mine, too. I'm happy that your leave is sanctioned. If you're going to my village then, please tell my mother that I'll get my younger sister married when I'm back. She's not just your sister, but ours too. We'll all get her married. -Won't we? -Surely, we will. You haven't slept as yet? No, sir. Not feeling sleepy tonight. The Chinese army has destroyed the Assam Rifles and is marching towards your post. Ajaib Singh, take care of yourself. -May the Lord be with you. -Sir, may the Lord be with you. Sir! Sir! Sir! Baba! Baba! Baba Singh... Baba Singh... Fast! Be quick! Baba! Wait. The enemy's not in our range. There's a big difference between their guns and ours. Don't fire until their heads are clearly visible. Okay, sir. Ajaib Singh, the bullets are over. Bring them quickly. Yes, sir. Ajaib Singh, deliver bullets to section one and section three. -Quick. -Okay, sir. Take it. All our soldiers are getting killed. -Don't send them forward. -Shut up! If our soldiers are dying, the enemy's bullets are also getting over. No, sir. -Okay, sir. -Go! Come on! Dammit! Ajaib! Get down! Come on, Bahadur. Move! We did you save me? It's because your wife is waiting for you. Your father's waiting for you too. Sir, the machine gun from section one have stopped firing. The enemy's still advancing towards us. They're coming here to die. Take charge. I'll check. What's our casualty, Joginder Singh? There's been heavy casualty, sir. What about the enemy? The enemy's casualty is much more. Sir, somehow make arrangements for the weapons. As long as there are weapons at Joginder Singh's post I will keep the enemy at bay. I'll arrange the weapons, Joginder Singh. Hold on to the post. Don't let the enemy come forward. Yes, sir! Sir, now that we're at war I should also be given a chance to attack the enemy. Come on, let's go. -Have some water. -Come on, go quickly. Sir... Mahinder... Come on, be quick. Come on, keep it here. That's not a problem. Bahadur Singh, you're injured. You should go down to the base immediately. Sir, the Lord says that "He alone is a hero, who fights the spiritual battle. He may be cut apart in pieces, but, never does he desert the battlefield." Sir! Just stay here. Please stay... Soldier, not everybody gets the opportunity to sacrifice their life for their country. God has given you the opportunity to do so. Take this. Deliver this ammunition to Joginder Singh's post right away. And fulfill your desire to blow the enemy. Sir, with this order, you've fulfilled my family and my dream. Soldier, don't waste time. Yes, sir! Sir! Maan Singh has sent the weapons for you. Bhaag Singh, what are you waiting for? The enemy is in front of you. Fire! Sir, can I shoot too? Bhaag Singh, fire! This is your only chance to put an end to all the taunts. Keep the gun on the trench, aim and fire! Remember, one bullet, one enemy! Yes, sir! Bhaag Singh! Santokh, my family... will now be proud... Bhaag Singh! Hey! Come on, get up. Come on. Thank you, buddy. Swaran Singh stop being scared. You're an Indian soldier. Cowards die many deaths, but the brave one only die once. Be brave. Very good, Ajaib Singh. Well done! You saved Swaran Singh's life. By the Lord's grace, you are also safe. Sir! The Lord's will has prevailed. What do you mean? Sir, we'll now meet in the next life. Ajaib Singh. Swaran Singh! Swaran Singh! Yes, sir! Sir, you're hurt. Bahadur Singh, don't worry about me. Kill the enemy. Sir, if I kill two, four come out. If I kill ten, 20 come out. They're like ants. They don't get over. Blow them up with a bomb. Bring the bombs, Bahadur Singh. Bahadur Singh! Bahadur Singh. Bahadur Singh. Bahadur. Bahadur. Bahadur. Bahadur. Bahadur. My father... All troops are ordered to retreat from their posts and return to headquarters. Sir, only five soldiers are left. The enemy may return. Please send the weapons as soon as possible. Joginder Singh, the enemy has deceitfully attacked all our posts at the same time. We don't need ammunition anymore. The headquarters have ordered all posts to save their lives and retreat. Joginder Singh, I know I've taught you, when it is about the country's security, a soldier never retreats under any circumstance. But now, I order you to return with the surviving soldiers. This soil is my mother, sir. And it now has my brothers' blood. I cannot retreat from here and deceive my friends and my motherland. No matter what happens, sir Joginder Singh won't retreat from this post. Joginder, don't be stubborn. Just come back. Think about your family. Sir, the Lord has entrusted me to take care of my countrymen. If anything happens to me, I'm sure my countrymen will take good care of my family. Joginder, try to understand. Come back. I don't want to lose you at any cost. Our country needs brave people like you. I know you love me and until now, I've followed every order of yours. But, I'm sorry. I can't follow this one. If possible, send more ammunition. God will take care. Oh Lord... please take care of Joginder Singh and his soldiers. To destroy the Sikh regiment, we have to attack from three directions. Son, a mother's debt can be repaid, for her nurturing. But the debt to the motherland can't ever be repaid. Protect the motherland, till your last breath. Don't falter. We are happily going to Sacrifice our life to you, O mother O my country, my every birth Is to serve you My motherland is more important to me Than my life I give my blood For my motherland I will shine as a star from your sky O my country, my every birth Is to serve you I did not turn my back and run tell my mother about it I have fulfilled my duty here, But could not repay your debt I did not turn my back and run, Tell my mother that. I have fulfilled my duty here, But could not repay your debt I could not repay your debt, For nurturing me O mother, always be there To comfort me I've consigned my blood On the soil of my motherland I will shine as a star From your sky O my country, my every birth Is to serve you My every birth! Sir, we are out of bullets. We have no ammunition left. Sir, they are coming closer and are large in number. Sir, it's over. I want the Indian Commander alive. Let me see how long he can survive before Pong. Death's in front of you. You should return. The headquarters has ordered us to do so, as well. What about you, sir? I have made my decision, Santokh Singh. How will we fight without ammunition, sir? You don't need ammunition to win a war. But courage. Victory, in the name of the Lord! The Lord, the ultimate truth! Can someone tell me when my dad will be back? He is his father. Greetings. -Greetings. -Greetings. Subedar Joginder Singh... achieved martyrdom in enemy captivity on the fourth of December. Mother, what happened? Uncle, what happened? He bravely fought for and protected the country till his last breath. The Indian Army and the whole country will always be very proud of him, for his courage and patriotism. Be strong. Be strong. -My dear... -Uncle! Surjeet! What's happened? Surjeet! Surjeet! Surjeet! -What's happened? -Oh, Lord! Surjeet! What's happened to my daughter? Surjeet! Surjeet! Open your eyes! What's happened to my child? Surjeet! What happened to my child? Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
