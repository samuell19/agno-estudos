Hey. Who are you? I'm Helen, I'm your wife. And you're Malcolm, my husband. I'm a Malcolm? Since I met you anyway. Who knows who you were before that? Did you take your pill? I left a note. You're supposed to take it. Doctor's orders, remember? Of course, you don't remember. You're supposed to take it when you wake up. Go get one, I'll get you some water. Hmm. I'll reset the timer. Next one's in two hours. Um, what is this? It's for your head. Doctor said those pills, plenty of rest, and you'll feel normal soon. There we go. Alarm set. I don't remember anything. Sit down. I'll tell you, again. One of these times you're gonna think that's a funny joke. A joke? I guess I shouldn't have high hopes, you're the funny one. I'm the looks and the brains. I'm the funny one? How do you think you landed such a hot wife? You said it was the best. What? The photo. You said it was the best one of us, so what's the point in having any others? I wanted lots of pictures, but that's not your style, as you put it. Plus, it's kind of romantic. One single image to sum us up. Who needs anything else? Where was it taken? I can't believe more hasn't come back to you yet. It was a day trip. Nothing significant. We were going for a hike in the middle of nowhere, but someone forgot the food at home. It was early and there was nothing around except for this run-down gas station with a closed diner attached. We were starving and in desperate need of coffee when an old couple came out of the diner. They owned the place and were headed out, but you convinced them to make us some coffee and to part with yesterday's muffins before they left for church. They were on their way to church? Jesus. Am I always pushy? No, you weren't pushy. They chose to help us. I remember they said it was as if church had already started for the day. The sun was barely up and they already had a chance to do well by someone. Will you try something for me? Will you close your eyes? Close my eyes? Please. I think it could help. Okay. Now, try to picture the diner. It was old, decorated once in the '70s and left to wear away. While they made us coffee, we sat in this booth... With vinyl seats? Sounds right. Do you remember the muffins? Chocolate chip. Dry. To make them edible we had to dip them in our coffee. Hmm, mine broke off. You said something like uh, "I have to..." "Chew my coffee." Chew your coffee, exactly. What I really remember is you left $50 on the counter, even though they insisted we not pay. So I'm showy? No, you're not showy. You just know what's important in life and it's not money. You're a good person, Malcolm. Forgetful at times, but a good person. My head, what happened? Whiplash. Whiplash did this? I know, it's nuts. So there was an accident? Yeah, someone cut us off, and you broke hard, but the truck behind didn't, and it shot us into the car in front. Us? You were in the car, too? You put your arm out to protect me, got too close to the airbag, and it shot your head back into the headrest. If I hadn't been in that car... Hey, Helen, no. Hey. It's okay. I'm so sorry you got hurt. How many times have you had to tell me what happened? Seven. I feel like I don't even know you. It'll come back. You'll figure it out. What if I don't? You will. Doctor said so. This isn't a chore for me. I'm here because I wanna be. Because I want you. The doctor said to take it easy. Seven days is easy, right? Don't tell me you forgot this, too? Right here? Right now? If you want to. I thought you were gonna join me in the shower. You okay? Who is this? You know him? Yeah, it's Ian. Uh, I told you he wasn't better yet. Ian? Yeah. Yeah, I'm Ian. Your friend. Um, if you say so Um, don't just stand there, come on in. Honey, the doctor said to limit visitors. Come on. Yeah, I don't know if I should really... Come on, you came all the way out here. And besides, I think you know I'm doing better. Fine. Go get your pill, I'll get the water. Perfect. Ian. Um, you come in. I'll put some clothes on. You okay? How about some coffee? Yeah, sure. Don't forget your pill. Yeah, I'm gonna get it now. And you, make yourself at home. Thanks. It's nice havin' a visitor. This your first time here? What? I mean visiting me since... Right. You really don't remember if I've been by or not? Uh, I've been workin' on trying to figure out what I don't remember. Well, that's tough. But uh, no, I have not been by. It's been a long week. Yeah, tell me about it. Really, tell me about it. It felt natural. I hope you... I hope you kn... She knew I smoked, right? She smokes, too. Good, otherwise, that would have been awkward. Wouldn't want things to be awkward. So Ian was just going to tell me about his week. Oh, I don't know if that's a good idea. The doctor said uh, only tell stories relating to you. Anything else could be more damaging than helpful. Yeah, I mean I guess we should follow doctor's orders. Man, you took a nasty spill and honestly I'm just glad to see you're still breathing. Okay. So tell me a story about me? - What? - What? Like the doctor said, stories about me, right? I wouldn't know what to say. Anything. The stories Helen has been telling me, they've really been helping. Baby, where's the ashtray? Uh, somewhere around here... Don't worry about it. I think I'm more of a black coffee person, at least since my spill, anyway. Maybe we should just stick to me telling the stories. We made such good progress today. Just us, alone. Actually, I might have a short story that I could share. - Perfect. - No. Helen. I can't just be the guy that you remember. I don't know what kind of memories he might trigger. Probably the ones me that turned me into the man that you married. Is there a problem? I think this will be good. I hope so. It'd be a shame to ruin all the progress we've made. Well, go on. Okay. So, there was this road trip. For what? Um, music festival. Who's car did we take? Mine. Uh, old shit box, only had a tape deck, kinda smelled like cigarettes. Where was that? Like where were we? You wanna play 20 questions or do you wanna hear the story? Okay, so we get to the festival, and we park, and when we do, we realize that we forgot our tickets. So I went off to find a scalper while you waited by the car. It was hot as shit that day. You were telling me this later on that night when we went to the bar, the usual one uh... Walt's? - Yeah. - Yeah. Walt's, exactly. Anyway, you got out of this hot as shit car and when you did, you accidentally scratched the truck of the guy that was next to us. He didn't like it so much and he started getting in your face, so you punched him. I don't think this is the kind of story Malcolm needs to be hearing. Well, I don't think that just because you don't like the story, it doesn't mean it's not a part of his past. Anyway. It was around then I returned with four tickets and two women. I met em by the scalper, they were uh, little short on cash and they said that the only thing that they liked more than country music was country boys. So we show up and we find you surrounded by three guys. You decided, "You know what? I'm gonna try to reason with them." You offered to pay for the scratch to the truck, the trouble was it was past that. I remember there was a guy swinging a length of chain. Yeah, so you're tough, but you're not dumb, Malcolm. If there's a way out of danger, you you're gonna find it. The problem was, they didn't want money, they just wanted to fight. So when that guy with the chain started swingin' it, before he had the chance, "bam!" I knock out his knees, and break his frickin' nose, move onto the next guy, and then you take on the third. Anyway, it's at this point that one of those assholes starts calling for more of his friends to show up. You tell me that luck's about to not be in our favour. You tell me to toss the tickets to the girls. We get into the car and peel out. Anyway, best concert I've never been to, that's for sure. I like country music? Well, we liked country girls. Alright, that's enough. No, no, that was good. I think I got a lot out of this. Well, I'm glad I could help. Stay for dinner. You being here is giving me a better picture of exactly what my life is really like. Yeah. Uh, sure, I'll stay. I guess I'll start making pizza. Hmm. Give me another cigarette and tell me about those country girls. Another time. I think we've pushed Helen's buttons enough today? You afraid of her? Honestly? A little. You afraid of me? No, Malcolm, I'm not afraid of you. You're just a big old teddy bear. Yeah. So I've been told. Wait. I shit-canned my own wallet to avoid fighting a kid? Yeah, and not only that. When the security came by, you told them that he just slipped and fell. You completely took out the whole attempted robbery part, because as you know, the fact that he had reduced himself to robbing a dude while he was taking a shit in a public bathroom. Figured he could use a break or somethin'. You've always been a judgement call kinda guy. I did not know that story. Hmm, me neither. To the funny one. No, to the looks. Don't forget brains. You certainly are the brains of this operation. Malcolm? Cheers to that. Malcolm, are you okay? How long have we been friends, Ian? - I don't know... - What about Helen? How long have you known my wife? Long enough. Your head okay? You good to get your pill? Sure. Hey, you okay? Ian had to leave. Malcolm. Maybe you need to lie down. You need some sleep. I'm glad Ian left. Me, too. You probably won't remember this tomorrow, but I love you and I love being your wife. - Malcolm. - What, what? I think someone's trying to break in. You stay here. There's two of them. Two? It'll be alright. Get the gun from the safe. Gun? What safe? Tell me you remember the combo. Six digits. Again. Found you. Just take whatever you want. We just want what's in the safe. Open it or we hurt your wife. I don't know if I can. Do I look like somebody who jokes around to you? I can't. No, stop hitting his head! Don't hurt my wife. That's up to you. Open it and we leave. Just give us what we want and we'll leave. I can't. I don't know the combination. The hell you don't. Stop hitting his head! No! This is not quitting. I said I was gonna try and quit. Either be a smoker or don't be a smoker. Quit tryin' to be both. Well, at least, I'm not smoking inside. Small victories. What time did you come to bed last night? I was waiting for a call from work. I don't know, I wasn't keeping track. Not only did your wife fall asleep alone, unsatisfied and wearing something completely impractical, but you left the light on again and that damn hum woke me up again. Hey, I changed the light. I don't know what more you want me to do. Fix the problem. How impractical are we talking here? Caught that, did you? Is it uncomfortable? All lingerie is uncomfortable. How uncomfortable? I wanted you to help me take it off. I can still help you take it off. When? Right here, right now. Hey! You said no climbing on the table. I did, didn't I? You wanna help mommy make pancakes while daddy has a cold shower? You can join me if you want. You should have come to bed. Can I have pizza today? For breakfast? Maybe for dinner. I was hoping you'd join me. Dad, look how big my hand is now. Out! Sorry, dad. Gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me. Jesus. Yeah, fuckin' asshole. Hey. Weren't you gonna join me in the shower? Who has time for that? Give me that big mixing bowl please. This would have been easier in the city, where I'd have all my usual stuff. Malcolm? Malcolm! You're right. Like I said, it would've been easier to both if you had stayed there. Hey. When you throw a ball, gotta your arm straight. This way it goes where you're looking. Alright? Like this? Almost. That was really good. Babe, it's time. Try it again. Malcolm. Fine. Hey, Sammy, it's time for 6-years-olds to call their nannas. You know any 6-years-old around here? Me! You wanna say hello to my mother? At least, put that stuff in the shed. Don't you dare pop that. Perfect. Two 6-years-old. Help me do the sign. It's good that my mum can video chat with him, otherwise she'd crash this place in a heartbeat. You know, how she likes to turn up unannounced. Ow! You didn't tell anybody where this place is, right? You're hurting me. Answer the question. No. I know the drill. I didn't tell anyone. Good. Can you grab that? You're a real dick sometimes, you know that? I didn't ask you to come. You chose to come. You know why this is important to me. Just Jesus, stop. We should be in the city with our family and his friends, but you wouldn't say "no" to work, so instead it's just the three of us. We're all the way out here and you're bein' an asshole. Why are you so afraid to be part of this family? Let's just get this hung before he wakes up, okay? Get the presents out. I've got to finish makin' a fucking cake. Happy birthday, buddy. Happy birthday. Raar! I'm gonna eat you. Yum, yum! Oh, this is crazy, man. Here we go. Wasn't there one more present? That's everything that was in the closet. No, there was another one. It must be in the car. I'll get it. Hey. I love you. I love you, too. Did you find it? You didn't tell anybody we were around here, did you? - Not this again. - Hey! No, I didn't tell anyone. Dad, it's not working. Can you make it glow? Hey, buddy. Why don't you take your toy and go under your bed? You'll be able to see it better in the dark. Mommy will go with you. What's happening? I told you this was a bad idea. Shit. I thought it'd be best if we talked out here. Yeah. I don't know who you are, I don't know what you want, but I am certain that you are in the wrong place. Malcolm, if we found you all the way out here, I think you know what we want. I'm gonna give you one chance here to turn and leave. Nobody has to know about this. Malcolm, help! Missed your chance. Shall we? They're waiting for us. On the couch. Sit down. I assume my son is okay. We don't wanna hurt a child. But we will. You're gonna give us what we want. Why don't you get it for us? I don't know what you want. Goddamnit, Malcolm, just give them what they want! They won't tell me what they want. We want what's in the safe. You have the wrong people, you have the wrong house! We we don't have a safe! Wanna bet? Should we keep looking? Maybe in your son's room. Open it. I said, "Open it". And I told you to turn around and leave. Go get the kid. Malcolm, please. Don't. I don't care what's in the safe, I don't care what it means to you, just give it to them before they hurt Sam! It's not mine, okay? I can't, okay? I can't. You mean you won't. Last chance. You need to leave now before it's out of my hands. No. No. No. No! No! I can't open the safe. Please, just take anything else. Leave me and my son alone. No! Take them to the shed. Make sure they can't move. No! You don't behave, I hurt your son. Got it? Everything okay? I heard a gunshot. Hey, you guys are all business. Alright, don't worry, I got this. Jesus, someone did get shot. I hate the sight of blood, I told you that. I was very straightforward... The safe's in the closet. Can we lose the masks? It's hard to take you guys seriously. Phew! Isn't that better? Don't talk to me. Get to work, we're on a timeline. Okay, boss. You're not gonna like this. Already? Just keeping him unconscious. This one knocks him out, this one starts the process, and these keep him susceptible. Just how many times you've done this before? Enough to know it works. Someone mentioned a plan B before. Phase 2. Sounds good, start it. You can't open this? I didn't say that. But I can't open it and guarantee I won't destroy what's inside. You can't open this? It's dangerously unassuming. Oh, it's dangerously unassuming. Yeah, it's dangerously unassuming and I know that because I read the manual. There's a manual! I read the manual, because I'm a professional. Okay, great, he's a professional and I guess that just... If I trigger one of a dozen fail safes, it incinerates what's inside. If we try to move the safe and the internal level is thrown off while the door's locked, it incinerates what's inside. If I enter a combination wrong six times in a 12-hour period, it incin... It'll incinerate what's inside. Yeah. And it also sets off a controlled explosion designed to mangle the hands of whoever's trying to break in, which is not ideal for me. So if you're 100% sure you need what's inside. You have an option of opening it safely? We do. Well, exhaust that before I start tinkering. It's my professional opinion. Try five combinations. Oh, you know, in his professional opinion that's gonna set us back. Do it. Hide that bullet hole. Sorry. Take your stuff back to the van. Help me load things up. What? Looks personal, put it in the bin. Why? That was personal. Isn't this gonna be weird waking up in the middle of the afternoon wearing his pajamas? Trust me. I like those ones. These ones? I think I wore these that night we got drunk. On the couch, didn't have time to close the blinds. Yeah, those ones. Perfect. I've never worn them before. We've also never had couch sex. What are you talkin' about? I'm sure you've been with a woman wearing something similar and I'm also sure you've had sex on a couch. No, we had couch sex. You think we have, because you put me there. I set the scenario and the tone of action, suggest things like hot and heavy, drunk. And you added all the details. On the couch. No time to close the blinds. Those are you filling in an augmented memory. You remember it, because I put myself into a memory you already had, generic enough to manipulate. With sex? With the power of suggestion. Okay. But we have memories that you can manipulate. How the hell are you supposed to fake a life with this guy? Leave it to me. You think it's gonna work? If I can make him believe that he's loved, smart, decisive, and strong, but also passive, strategic, and not at all a hero, then yes. Okay, well, what if it doesn't work? Even the kid? Go check if everything's getting cleaned up outside. We're on a timeline. Cups are in here. You guys always clean house when you rob someone? Keep moving, asshole, we're on a timeline. And I thought my people skills were bad. Get the water bottle and put your mask back on. Pink's her colour. We wanna give you some water. You've been through a lot and it's not over yet. Understand? Are you thirsty? More. Please. Malcolm! Malcolm! We are out here! Stupid. Where the hell are you going? He's waking up. What about me? Put these on and help watch them. Don't do anything stupid, I still need you if this doesn't work. Helen! Helen! Why why do I have to baby-sit? You think it's better if he's inside with me? Someone should be, yeah. Just... Be safe. Don't fuck up. Damn it! Hey, who are you? What the hell are you doing? What? Close my eyes? Please, I think it could help. Now, try to picture the diner. Who is it? Shut up. You tryin' to trick me, huh? I don't wanna hurt you or your boy, but I will. That's enough. Enough! What the hell? She said don't do anything stupid and it seems to be about all you're doing. What the fuck am I supposed to do while she's in there alone with him? That's what this is about! I thought you two were professionals. Hold this. Alright. And watch them. - Watch them? - Yeah. What do you mean watch them? - Just fucking watch them. - You gotta be kidding me. What the hell are you doing? He's watching them. I mean here. You screwed him? Damn right, I screwed him, and if I think it'll get us in the safe, I'll do it again. You never said that you were going to... I don't need to run anything by you. Now, get the hell out of here. I thought you were gonna join me in the shower? Oh, the shower. Who's this? Who are you? It's Ian. I told you he wasn't better yet. Ian? Yeah. Yeah, I'm Ian. Your friend. Leave, now. Look, he just invited me in, alright? Besides, I can help. You have no idea what you're doing. Helen, how hard can it be? You okay? Wait. I shit-canned my own wallet to avoid fighting a kid? Yeah, and not only that. When the security came by, you told them that he just slipped and fell. You completely took out the whole attempted robbery part, because as you know, the fact that he had reduced himself... Drink up, asshole. Malcolm, you okay? We don't need him to make judgement calls. We need him to cower and do what we say. And he didn't take a spill, he was in a car accident with me. Well, how was I supposed to know... Just go to the shed and wait for the signal. Hello. It's almost done. There were variables to the plans you supplied me. It's not an excuse. No, that doesn't sound good. Absolutely, we will have it done by the timeline. Alright, when the time comes, you're coming with me. No way, man, that's not my deal. It's three against one. Just stand still and stand tall. What about them? I dare you to try something. Time to go. Chris just wanted to help. I never thought he'd be a hero and get himself killed. Besides, weren't you supposed to be taking care of this guy's killer instincts and make him care about his wife? That's not how it works. Oh, well, how does it work? Only the subject can choose to change who they really are. Well, what is the point of all of this shit then, alright? The house, the photo... Come on. Babe. Did you or did you not bring Chris in here with you? Do you know how to open the safe? So you don't know how to get what we need. What are you doing? He only tried four combinations, right? I don't know. Maybe his briefcase to you know, crack in or whatever. I'll get it from the van. Found it! Helen? You okay? Helen? Uh, okay. Take it easy, Malcolm. It's it's me, Ian. My friend, right? Yeah, that's right. I'm your friend and Helen's your wife. What the hell are you doin'? Where are they? Where's who? Don't say anything, Ian. You found me all the way out here. So you know who I am, don't you? We can offer you... I was talkin' to my friend. Yeah, I know who you are. Good. How about this? You let her go, I put the gun down. That's funny. Helen, honey, isn't that funny? Hmm. He thinks it's the gun that's stopping me. Don't you hurt her! Ian, don't shoot! Where's my family, shithead? I can do this all night long, Ian. Where is My family? They're in the shed! Al alright? They're in the shed. There you go. It wasn't so hard, now was it? No! It was so scary. I know, buddy. I know. But it's better now. Take Samuel and get in the car, and get somewhere safe, alright? Where are the keys? Take this. Anyone but me walks through that door... Hurt them. His family was our only leverage. It didn't work before. What difference does it make? You never give up leverage. Just go bring him in. We still need him to open the safe. Ian? Phase 3. Start with the wife and bring me the kid. Mom's with you. Good boy. Open the safe and we leave. You should have left when you had the chance. Patrice. Malcolm! Malcolm! I killed him. I had to. I know. I know. Hey, it's okay. Come on. My head hurts. I know. Can you can you do this? Okay, keep it like that. You'll feel better in a bit. Come with us. I can't. You can't? Or you won't? Malcolm, what's in the safe? - It doesn't matter. - Yes, it does. Not to me. Whatever it is, whatever they put in there, it doesn't matter. It's my j... Your job? Hey, this isn't over. I need you to take that gun, get in the car, and drive Samuel away from here. I need you to leave, so I can finish this. Coffee? I like it with cream. That I remember. So I have a few questions for you and I'm hoping you can give me some answers. If I can. What did you do to me? It's called "augmented memory". I gave you temporary amnesia and filled in the blanks, alright? This part of it? The syrettes knock you out, the vials induce amnesia, and the pills lower inhibitors, which make you susceptible to leading. And why empty the house? Come on, Helen. These are the easy ones. We need to start with a clean slate. If there's nothing specific for you to latch a memory to, you can be led. Why go through all that trouble? To make you the man I needed you to be. Oh, yeah? What kind of man is that? One who cares enough about his family to open a safe. What happens if you take too much? You forget everything. I have to tell you, I have seen a lot of things that make people talk. This is new to me. Next question. Who sent you? Oh, come on. I can't answer that. Who sent you? I can't tell you. You mean you won't. My methods may not be as fancy as yours, but they work. Wife doesn't like me smoking in the house. Unlike you. I lost cell service when you pulled in. It's back now. Someone's been callin' you. They'll come for me soon. Who sent you? Do you even know who you work for? Damn! Why do you do it? I don't need to explain myself to you. Now... Before you forget forever, who do you... Yeah, he's dead. Hold on. Yeah, I see it. I'll call you back when it's secure.
