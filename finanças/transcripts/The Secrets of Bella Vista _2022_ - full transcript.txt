You got a call from the Spanish Minister who says they were the pair of silver nesting ladles that were stolen from the Tarronga Museum. I knew it. Tell him I'll call him when I get in. Also, the Pissarro came in, insane! I hope you don't mind, I peeked. Of course not. You can't be my assistant forever. Your ride-share should be pulling up. It's a black Pass at. How did you do that? Magic. You're amazing. Uh, any calls I can make from the car? Uh, well, Damhnaic McAuley called again. Did he say what he wanted this time? He just kept confirming details about you. It was a bit strange. But don't worry, I didn't tell him anything. Well, he's gonna have to tell you what he wants or he's gonna keep leaving messages. Your interview slot with Sheffield just landed tomorrow. 9:00 AM. How do you feel? Like I'm in rehearsals on Broadway. Well, I hear if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. You know, Kiley, you still haven't asked me about my cool find yesterday. It was so worth sitting in rush-hour traffic to get to this woman's house in Nob Hill. Thank you. An entire Imperial Russian tea service? Hallmarked Russian solid silver. Maker's mark for Sazikov. 1866. Ah! The old lady got it from her parents who somehow concealed it while running from the Tsar. Huh. Oh, happy birthday. Aw, thank you! Uh, reminder, I'm taking half a day tomorrow. Oh good. One of us should. Spoken like a true boss. But first, Miss Delaney, how do you feel about the travel demands of the new position? I grew up in Ireland, travel led the world with my mother, the antiquities hunter, starting at the age of 12. I have lived in four countries, speak three languages, and my go-bag is always packed. Life on the road is in my DNA. The go-bag's a nice touch. Thank you, I thought so too. You really think there's another work under there? What'd you call it? Pentimento. - A painting under a painting. - Wow. Art with a secret. My favorite kind. Hmm. Oh, I gotta take this. Um, and if that Damhnaic guy calls again? Find out what he wants. Okay. Open mine next. I bet you can't guess what it is. Mom... did you buy us the big expensive one we told you not to? Of course! I'm gonna be a grandma. Um... two more? Tess? Finally! - I'm sorry I'm late. - It's okay, it's okay. Are you sure you want me as his Godparent? I'm not exactly religious. Oh, honey, no. We asked someone else to be his spiritual guide. Please. But there's a more modern version... you. Yeah. The only child of a single mother who dumped me with her single mother when I was just a baby. That's modern. She came back for you. - Did she? - Mm hmm. When your nan died. Yeah, but then I was just her travel accessory. No, look, seriously I'm... I'm flattered. Really, I am. But why me? Tessie, you are such a good friend. We can count on you when the chips are down. And so will he. Okay, yeah, I'm honored. Yay! Thank you. - Oh. - Oh. Whoa, whoa. - Tess... - Tessie, are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. I just stood up too fast. When's the last time you ate? Uh... um... six mini-donuts at 4:00 PM. Six? Don't food shame me, Nellie. And I saw you drink nothing but espresso all night. I haven't slept. I've been prepping for my big interview. Lydia... Yeah. I'm packing you a doggy bag, Suzette's driving you straight home and you're gonna eat real food and go right to sleep so you can be fresh for tomorrow. No protests! And... my attention to detail led to the potential discovery of a rare Pissarro pentimento. Tess Delaney, you're as ready as you'll ever be. Oh... Excuse me. You're Tess Delaney? Oh... You're a hard woman to find. I'm sorry, you are...? Damhnaic McAuley. He's left you a few messages, remember? Oh, Damhnaic who keeps calling and refuses to say what he wants. It's a personal matter. Well, it's a business office. Okay. I can wait until after business hours. I only need five minutes. It's about your family. I don't have a family. And also I have a 9:00AM meeting. Well, that's in 15. The mysterious Damhnaic. So you'll tell me what I can do for you. We do stand-up meetings here. Oh, Okay. Um, I'm here on behalf of your grandfather, Magnus Johansen. Uh, no, my grandfather was Paddy Delaney and he died years ago. That must've been your mother's father. I'm here about your paternal grandfather. His name was Magnus. I don't have a father. I have a man who got my mother pregnant but he abandoned her before I was born, so... Well that may be, but Magnus recently passed. I'm the executor of his estate and you're named in his will to inherit half of Bella Vista. A 50-acre working apple orchard, its main house, grounds, and outbuildings in Archangel, California. What, this is a joke, right? I assure you. Obviously Gillie in Accounts put you up to this. Archangel is three hours away in a beautiful part of Napa Valley. Bella Vista's an incredible place. You can review the paperwork right now or have a lawyer look at it, but this is real. I promise you. I don't, um... What was his name? Magnus Johansen. He wanted you to have this right here. Nope. I can't do this. Miss Delaney... Your five minutes are up. The paperwork... It's okay. I'll sign everything and I'll have my assistant get it to you. Whoever inherited the other half of the orchard they can keep it all. That would be Isabel. Who? When your father died Magnus named you and your half-sister, Isabel to split his entire estate. Half-sister? Whoa! Miss Delaney I had one too many energy drinks. I'm fine. This has nothing to do with energy drinks. You fainted because your blood pressure dropped precipitously. Well, uh... I haven't slept and I travel a lot, so... it's probably jet lag. You work a lot? Eat unhealthy meals? I know you're just doing your job but I have this really big interview... You're gonna need to reschedule it. That's just not gonna work for me. Look, please take out the IV so I can go. Look, I see folks like you all the time. You come in here for something minor, you ignore my advice, you wind up back here with something major. What about pamphlets? You guys love pamphlets! And... what about a meditation app? I'll make a follow-up appointment. I'll reschedule, I'll come back. Please just let me go. Okay. I will release you only if you schedule a follow-up and because you have a friend here to take you home. Make sure that you get rest and fluids. A friend? Mm hmm. I'll get someone to take that IV out. Reschedule the appointment, please. - Hi. - Hi. You must really want me to sign those papers if you came all the way to the hospital. Well, you fainted after what I told you. I guess I felt somewhat responsible and I wanted to make sure that you were feeling okay. Well, it's been an eventful week, but I'm fine. What I really need to do is get back to the office. Oh, that meeting was cancel led. What? Yeah. I spoke with your assistant, Kiley? She said someone with the name Sheffield was on a flight to Singapore. So your meeting's been rescheduled. - No, I have to... - Whoa. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. So, uh... Singapore. That sounds glamorous. It is. Yeah, I bet. I've been to Hawaii, Japan, Korea. Oh, and Djibouti. But Singapore, it's on my short list. If only I could go there now. Yeah. Look, I'm sorry about your meeting, but we do need to talk. Look, I know you're all 'hit the road' and 'I surrender my rights' but there's legality involved here and if I let you sign away something this big after coming out of the hospital, I'd be a very bad banker. - Banker. - Yes. - Not lawyer? - No. Ugh. Do I seem like a lawyer? Okay, that must be why you didn't like me on sight. I... didn't say that. I read between the lines. - Hawaii, Japan, Korea... - And Djibouti. And Djibouti. Cusco? Peru. No. Bahrain. You've been to Bahrain. Why has a banker been to all these places? Maybe I haven't always been a banker. Now, let's get you home. Okay? Watch your step. Thank you. - Let me help you out. - I'm fine. My mom always said to see a woman home safely. Huh, my mom said never let a strange man into your apartment. Look, it took me a long time to find you. Even though you didn't know your grandfather, he wanted you to have half his orchard. I don't go back until tomorrow morning. So, will you just think about it? I will. I'll look you both up. The orchard and you. Mm hmm. Oh, um, I got these pamphlets at the hospital about stress, nutrition and, um... breathing. Maybe I'll try the breathing. Thanks. You're welcome. This looks gorgeous. Why wouldn't you go? Because... who are these people? They're not my relatives. I mean, they are but why now? - After all this time? - Go find out. Just go find out. They'll think I'm some kind of gold digger. They came to you. It's not your fault he died without connecting with you. But why didn't he? For someone who doesn't acknowledge me for his entire lifetime and now he leaves me half a piece of a giant property, I'm not supposed to ask questions? Of course you can. Ask your family when you get there. I'm pretty sure that pretending I don't exist isn't in the regulation family rule book. Did your mom ever talk about them? Yeah, she told me the same thing she says about everything personal. Zip. Her and my dad had a fling in college. She got pregnant. He wasn't interested in being a dad so she moved to Ireland. Doesn't even tell me his name and then she just goes off to travel the world. Left me with my nan. What? Stop. I am not like her. No, she runs from everything that ties her down. I'm... Doing the exact same thing? Doing the exact same job! Traveling all over the world? You gotta admit, the mechanics look a lot alike. She's a runner, you're a runner. Where do you think you got it from? Maybe your sister's good at family. Yeah. Do I even want a sister? Ugh... Maybe she's fantastic. Tess, what if the people and the orchard are amazing? Maybe you want this and you don't even know it. Your, uh... text said to meet you here? Yeah. For your ride. We're not driving? Why drive when you can go the scenic route? Bella Vista has a private plane? No. I do. I'm your pilot. Korea, Japan... That's right. Watch your head. Air Force? Navy. You weren't always a banker. There's always a story behind a story. Pentimento. What's that? Nothing. Magnus... uh, how did he die? He fell during picking. Died an hour later. He was this giant, robust man. He made a family of all of us. I'm sorry. Um... I don't know why Magnus never reached out. Why he only... Wanted me to know about him after he was dead? Look, Isabel can tell you whatever you wanna know. Sure. Yeah. Isabel, the long lost half-sister I also just found out about. I'm gonna take my foot outta my mouth long enough to start this plane. I'm sorry. I am. I don't, I don't mean to... Just let me know if there's anything I can do to help. - All good. - Okay. November Three Six Five One Yankee, ready for take off. November Three Six Five Yankee, you're cleared for take-off. Here we go. Do you travel like this often? When I can. There's Bella Vista's neighbors, right here. And... there's Bella Vista. Hey... it's gonna be okay. Hang on. There you go. - Thanks. - Yeah. Tess, meet Isabel. Isabel, Tess. You look like him. The truck's this way. You're gonna love the place, and Isabel. She's actually a genuinely amazing person. Ok. Wait, you're not coming? Uh, the bank's expecting me. I'll check back in with you later. And remember... Breathe. I Magnus never told me about you. I didn't know until the will. I'm sorry. For what? For... existing? So... no one knew about me? Does anyone even know I'm coming? I told them all last night after Damhnaic said you agreed to come. I don't know what to say here, I mean, I... I never had a sister. And we're grownup people so it's not like... We're actually family. Right. Right. You know what? Uh, let's call Damhnaic and, you know, uh I'll sign everything over to you. I don't want anything. I, I don't even know why I came. ♪ ...the blue skies up above me ♪ We're here. Look, you might as well see the place. It's what our grandfather wanted. ♪ Every day ♪ ♪ The sun shines in a new way ♪ ♪ Like it's telling me here come the best days ♪ Uh, you can drop your stuff here. Come on out, I'll grab you a plate. Everybody, there's more of everything. Please. Yeah, and you can take it home. Yes, please. Oh, that's her. You're her, Tess! Come in! Come in. Take a plate. Take a plate. Let's eat. We have everything. Chilaquiles. Tamales... Enchiladas... salad. Tess, you should see some of Magnus' puzzle boxes. Did you faint? We heard you fainted. When did you find out? Stop crowding her, let her eat. Come mi hija. Come. Careful Tess, she will try to stuff you with her enchiladas and tamales trying to make up for the last 30 years. If you want to know anything about the orchard, just ask. I'm Ernesto. And the woman who's been hovering over you is my sister, Estella. Erik told me everything I needed to know. He was always trying to get me to... Okay! Sorry. Is there a bathroom I could use? I'll take you. What? Come on, Estella. Aren't you dying to know why didn't Magnus ever mention Erik had a whole other family? It's the last door on the left. Do you need anything? No, just... Yeah, a few moments to myself. Hey Mom. I'm at my grandfather's orchard in Archangel, California. Where are you? Can I help? Sure. This must be really weird for you. Everyone's trying to figure out... When the next cat fight will start. I'm not really the cat fighting type. What type are you? Uh... homebody? I've only ever lived in one place. You've never been away from the orchard? No. Uh, Pop and Bubbi, Magnus and Eva, they raised me after my parents died. And by the time I was in my teens, they were in their 70's and needed me to run things. To cook the crew lunches, clean the stables, get all the paperwork. Wait. You made all the food on this table? Yeah. I mean, you're some kind of genius. - You don't cook? - I microwave. I could not have made a single thing on the table. Yes, you could. So, were you, um, hanging out in the bathroom until after everyone left? Oh, um... Actually I, uh, I sort of ended up in Magnus' study and I, I kinda got caught up looking at the photos. I really hope that's okay, I didn't mean to. Oh no, this is your place now too. Can I show you the orchard? It's the height of picking season. Yeah. - That's great. - Great. - After you. - Okay. Thank you. Most of the workers have homes here on the property. A lot have been here since Pop started the place, they're like... family. What are those, uh, buildings used for? Oh, um, the big one is where we get the apples ready for shipping and the small one used to be our farm stand. My Bubbi ran it. People would come from all over for her pies and jams. And she even sold a few antiques. She did what? She bought and sold antiques. Damhnaic told me that's what you do too, sell and appraise art and antiques? I do, yeah. And my mom. And my grandmother. Grandmothers, uh, like, actually on both sides apparently. Did she pick all the pieces in the house? Mm hmm. She had amazing taste. My nan had an antique shop in Dublin. I can't believe they did the same thing. Maybe they would've liked each other. Yeah. Maybe. Before I was born our father was in a car accident with his best friend. His friend survived but, um, our father didn't. A few months later, my mother died giving birth to me. Our grandparents never really spoke about it. I have a few stories from when he was younger, but aside from that I don't really know anything about him. Sometimes I think the real family heirlooms are the stories you get passed down. Before he died, Pop said something to me. He said, her treasure is here, in our home. Tess, listen, I wanna Isabel! Tess! Yeah? Isabel? Let's go check out today's harvest. Oh, and tomorrow, let's get you picking some apples. Yeah, sure. Let's [ceful] Leave the little ones on the inside. They don't get as much sunlight as the big ones. Like the ones you already have in your basket. So we leave these ones a little while longer for them to color up and get juicier and sweeter. When can we eat them? Soon. Soon. Yeah. Nice. You do this all day? Seven days a week during harvest for the last 30 years. Most of these crews have been working for the Johansens for decades. My sister and I included. Locals pick too. Isabel works school tours to teach harvesting with recipes and lessons, you know? Start 'em young. You know what? I think we have enough. Yay! Yeah, we did it! Come on. We're making pies. Oh. Yeah! Let's go. "We"? Nice and slow, take your time. Oh, good job. Don't forget you can roll it the other way too. My friend Lydia bakes all the time. She would love this. Oh, well maybe she can come visit. But we don't watch in this kitchen. Why don't you come sugar some apples? Ok. ♪ We don't need money, no ♪ ♪ We don't need money for ♪ ♪ Rainy days. ♪ ♪ We don't need anyone... ♪ Here we go. You can never have too much pie. Here you go. Oh, my little bunny rabbits! Hey, you spent a lot of time picking these apples. Slow down and savor it. Can another grown-up get in on this? Hey! Yeah. Hey. Can we go play? Of course, sweetheart. - Do you need help? - Thank you. Oh, here. There you go. That's it? Okay. Bigger piece on its way. We didn't have a meeting or anything, did we? Oh, uh... no, no. Just checking in. Oh right, for the pie. Mmm. It's really good. It's amazing. She makes the best pies. So... how are things going? Weird. No. Fine? I mean, Isabel's a surprise. A nice one. See? I told you. We've known each other since we were teenagers. She is one of the best people that I know. She's remarkably tolerant of small children. And the woman who has come to steal half her $20 million apple orchard, so... Well, it's not worth that. Okay, $10 million. Actually, um... it's about to be in foreclosure. What did you just say? Bella Vista is about to be in foreclosure. Uh, you... you didn't wanna tell me this in San Francisco or on the plane, or I don't know, at any time at all? - Can I explain? - Please. It goes back to Eva, your Bubbi. She was from a wealthy Jewish family who fled Germany in '39 with whatever they could pack in a hurry. Her baubles, Eva called them. They went into hiding with cousins in Denmark. Denmark, that's where Magnus is from. Magnus was working for the Danish resistance. They met when the house Eva was staying in was raided. Magnus actually rescued her. The rest of her family was lost. My God. That's when they fell in love. They, they came here and they built this place together. Practically teenagers. It's incredible. It's an incredible story. What does it have to do with...? Well, all of the deprivation that Eva suffered in hiding compromised her health. Back when she was diagnosed with cancer, pre-existing conditions were a way for insurance companies to deny coverage. They went broke paying for her treatment. He never thought about selling? Of course. I mean, there were multiple offers. Practically everyone that Magnus hired was an immigrant or a refugee. They, they live in all these houses on the property. How long do we have? I mean, how long until the foreclosure? End of the month. I know. I know. Can I show you something? Follow me. This is Wilbur. And this is Orville. I saw him being born. Isn't that right, Orrie? Wilbur and Orville. As in... Wright? I was in seventh grade, learning about first flight. You wanna take a ride? Um... for all the travel, I'm kind of a city girl. So... uh, I don't know, I've been on a horse like twice in my life. Orville's pretty gentle. Isn't that right, boy? It's a great way to see all the grounds. - Okay. - Yeah? Alright. I'll get a couple saddles. Okay. Hey. That, that's nice. I can't! Sorry. - Alright. - I can't get it. Put your weight down into the stirrup. Okay. And then lift up and pull, pull your foot all the way around. All the way up high and around. - Okay. - Okay? Oh... There you go, there you go, there you go. - I did it! - That's it. Here we go. So what now? Now you grab those reins and you follow me. Ok. I don't understand. I mean, Bella Vista must have been prosperous at some point. What happened? There was an early frost the year Eva died. Then, a multi-year drought. The orchard never fully recovered. So this is where you grew up, where were you born? - Ireland. - Ireland? - Mm hmm. Thurles, to be exact. - How'd you end up here? Well, my parents worked in a factory that closed during the recession. We immigrated here when I was really young. I was a wild kid. Angry. Always looking for trouble. The Johansens, they took us in, they sponsored our family and helped us get back up on our feet. Hmm. Magnus, he looked out for me, kinda like a grandfather. He's the one who suggested I join the Navy. I'm glad he did too. I learned some skills there and officially became an American. So the Navy was your path to citizenship? Path to my life, really. Turned everything around for me. I got into pilot training and became an officer, led some missions, found my purpose. What do you say we, uh, take a break and give these guys a treat. Huh? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Sure. - Let's go. I can't imagine living in one place my whole life. Or having this place as an anchor... somewhere to land. Hey! Here! Here! Hey, can you get that? - Lourdes. - Damhnaic. We're just warming up for some flag football. Wanna join us? - Um... - Hi. Lourdes, this is, um... Erik's daughter. Wow. Tess Delaney. Lourdes is the daughter of your father's best friend, Carlos. And Damhnaic's ex. Cool. So, I hear you're the one they hope will save the place. I'm sorry, but... what? - Really? - What? - Big antique hunter, right? - Mm hmm. Maybe Eva does have something valuable like Isabel thinks. It's not some big secret a, is it? Thank you. And have a good game. - Let me help. - No. - Tess... - You know what, I'm fine. Okay? It's fine. I gotta go. Look, what she said, it... Was perfectly clear. I'm here to do a job and you're here to make sure it gets done. With horses and pie and... I don't know. It's not like that. You're good at something that could help, yes, but... Tess! I'm heading back. Okay, well let me walk you. To San Francisco? Hang on, you're leaving leaving? Yeah, I have a big interview. And you know what? Up until two days ago I didn't know that any of you existed and not one of you cared either. You don't wanna know about your family? This isn't family! Family doesn't pretend that you don't exist until they need something! Send me the papers. I will sign everything, and we can all go back to our regularly scheduled lives. Okay? Nice meeting you. You just left? I have my rescheduled, you know, Sheffield meeting for the New York gig. But is that what you want? Why would one day away with strangers change everything that I've been working for my whole life? Was the place nice? I liked the place. Okay? I liked the people. I wanted... I don't know what I wanted. But you know what? What does it matter? They were using me anyway. Who are they? My relatives. Isabel must have snuck copies into my bag. That's my father. You really do look like him. That's my grandfather and my grandmother. Apparently he rescued her from the Nazis and they fell in love. What'd your mother say? Radio silence. Don't know why I expected anything different. I don't even know where she is. But that's consistent with the last 15 years of my life. Maybe she knows just as much as you do. Am I really like her? I only know what you've told me. But some of things you've said is it really a bad thing? You're a good friend. Maybe don't dismiss all of it. Take some time and think about it, okay? Morning, Ms. Sheffield. As I'm sure you're aware, I've continued to set records for high level acquisitions at the firm. Including two de Kooning paintings that I secured just last month and a pentimento. Wonderful. Tell me what drew you to this business. The love of those moments of discovery. The research that's required. The people I get to meet. Places I get to go. I really can't imagine doing anything else. Well, let me tell you a little bit about how we're restructuring the New York office. Miss Delaney, it's Doctor Denton. I see you missed your follow-up appointment. It's important we address... Hello? I just called to see if you made it home okay. Yeah. Um... I'm sorry that I took off like that. I was gonna call you to thank you for the photos. Tess, Damhnaic told me about your conversation with Lourdes. Your job is not the reason why we wanted you here. Okay. It's not the only reason. Listen, Isabel, you don't have to I'm sorry. I am. I don't know what to do. Bella Vista is gonna go away. I was hoping that your expertise might help but I should've said that up front. And I'm really sorry. Do you know what you're gonna do? This is gonna sound wild. I keep searching, thinking that maybe when Pop said her treasure is here in our home that... It meant that there was actually something hidden here. Buyers have been calling ever since Pop passed. Real estate agents for the houses, a cider brewery for the land... Hey Isabel... uh... Damhnaic said when Eva and her family fled Germany they, they brought some baubles with them. Do you know what they were? She never really spoke about the Holocaust. He also said the family had money. Do you know its source? They were in banking, but... The Nazis seized all their assets. Yeah, uh, in '38 Jews had to register all their assets with the German government. They were subjected to harsh tax penalties and if they couldn't pay, their assets were seized. But if Eva's family was planning an escape they could've secreted a few items away. Like... from her father's collection? - Eva's father was a collector? - Yeah. Isabel, did Eva ever show you a metal belt? It's a chain with something that looks like coins strung together. No, I don't remember anything like that. Why? Because when Magnus and Eva escaped, she might've been wearing the means to save the orchard. Wait, what are you saying? It's such a long shot, but maybe... Her treasure is Eva's treasure? And there could actually be something in the house. Hey, Tess, um, I don't suppose I could convince you to come back to Bella Vista for another visit? Refugees often sew valuables into their clothing or disguise accessories so they can sell them for food, cross borders... negotiate for their lives. And you think that's what this is? That these coins could... Yeah, so you see how these three coins are irregular? How they're not like the other coins? A lot of valuables have turned up that way in my work. Magnus rescued Eva when her family was hiding in Denmark, right? With the help of an American soldier he befriended. Leon Calderon. Calderon? Lourdes' dad? Granddad. Uh, her father Carlos and our father were best friends. Carlos was in the car with Erik when he died. That's right. Would he talk to me? He took off after the car accident and never came back. From everything I heard, he was a pretty shady guy. Poor Lourdes. Magnus took them in for a while, but... I mean, they really had nothing. Just the clothing on their backs and a few trinkets. I'm starting to understand why everybody talks about Magnus like he was such a great man. Yeah. How do you feel about some wine? So, the coins on the belt you really think they could be valuable? It's impossible to confirm from the photo but the three that I can sort of make out they could be Bust Collar, Class 1 coins. Eight total were made and four are known to be circulating but no one knows what happened to the other four. And you think Bubbi had three? It was a long time ago. The photos are blurry and we don't even know where the belt could be so I really don't wanna get your hopes up. But if we could find it, how much could a coin like that be worth? Uh, well, the last one sold in 2017 for just under $4 million. Wha... uh... You think that Bubbi could've escaped with almost $12 million? Just... tell me exactly what Magnus said. He said her treasure is here in our home. And you know, I... I thought that he meant, like... Like emotionally. Yeah, like, offering his final words. To hold onto our home, our treasure. Did he say more? No. He died on the way to the hospital. But I can reach out to my contacts in the marketplace. See if anyone's heard anything. Okay. And I guess I'll hold off the buyers for a little while longer. I'm sorry, I have to go. I have to prep for the grape stomp tomorrow at the Seaside Pearl Winery. I promised I'd bake bread for a booth. Do you wanna come? - Yeah. Sure. - Great. Do you need help now? I can... Oh no. Please, no. This time of day here is the absolute best. Enjoy it. 1804 Bust Collar Class 1 coins, question mark. Possibly owned by my paternal grandmother, question mark. Thoughts, question mark, question mark. I'm waiting on you, Mom.

That would be amazing, thank you. So, um, what does one wear to a grape stomp? Whatever you don't mind getting stained with grape juice. I'm sorry, wait... I'm stomping grapes? Oh... um... Wow... This is so sweet. Hi. Hi. I told Ernesto, that girl understands who we are. What Bella Vista is. She'll be back. Thank goodness Estella was right. Please tell me you're doing the grape stomp. Isabel signed me up. Yeah, but careful for Damhnaic, he's a ringer. Shh... remember what I told you. Are you sure you don't mind getting your outfit all stained with grape juice? I promise I'm good. Alright. It's no fair, you have bigger feet! - They pay off every year. - Ahhhh! Go Tess! I'm really trying, Isabel. I'm really trying. I can see that. ♪ Come on, come on, come on... ♪ Don't stop. Don't stop! You're doing great. You're doing great! There you go. - Time! - Okay. Damhnaic wins again this year. Bravo. Thank you. That's a, that's a very close second. Thank you. Do these red stains ever come out? I think I actually got some in my hair. With beautiful red hair, how would you know? Well my hair's not usually sticky. Good point. You hungry? Uh... yeah. Starving actually. Yeah, me too. Uh... excuse me. We'll take this, please. Uh, do you want... Do you have, um, maybe something sweet? - Like a dessert thing, or... - Good idea. - Yeah. - I love my sweets. There's a photo of Magnus and Eva with Erik when he was a baby, she's wearing the belt with coins. Hmm. I mean, I've seen long shots like this pay off and it's the only way to save the orchard and keep Isabel and the families where they belong. You care about them. I care that Magnus' legacy continues. I mean, I think that he and Eva deserve at least that. Right? Right. - Well, to Magnus and Eva. - To Magnus and Eva. So when do you go back? I told, uh, work that I'd be back in the office on Monday. Hmm. Can I give you a ride back to the orchard? Yes. I have a giant magnum of wine to celebrate with if the coins are what you think they are. You're on. No... Isabel? Is... - Hey, baby. - Mom. How did you...? When did you...? You called, I came. Like a week ago. I texted. I left voice messages. I was in Sri Lanka. Advik sends his love. Wait'll you see what he found me. You kept a sister from me. Other grandparents. You didn't even text back when I called to ask you about it. And now a whole family is in jeopardy and because of you... Me? I found out too late to do anything about it! Oh, just slow down, Tess. No. You've had years. I don't know all the pieces. Will you just tell me? Hey. Please, stop. Please, can you just tell us what happened? I met Erik the summer before my senior year at Berkeley. He said he was married, but separated, and on his way to divorce. We fell hard. Talked about getting married. And then his wife turned up pregnant and wanted to work it out. I would never take a man from his wife and child, so I broke it off. Two months later I realized I was pregnant. I didn't wanna get in Erik's way, so I graduated early and I was moving back to Ireland at Christmas without telling him. And we ran into each other. I was showing and Erik figured it out. He asked if I could meet him the next day, Christmas Eve, at a diner on Dolores Street. He didn't show up. I figured he'd changed his mind. It was only when I was back in Ireland that I found out that he was killed on his way to see me. That's why I never told you. If I hadn't agreed to meet him. But you didn't tell anybody. Didn't you think they'd wanna know me? They were mourning a son. His wife was a widow with a baby on the way, how could I add to that? And... and plus they would hate me. Oh, so you were just thinking about you. Can we not do this right now? I saw the photo that you sent of Eva and I think you could be right. One of them could be a Bust Collar, Class 1. Maybe all three. Well then, we should... Well then we should try to find them. If Eva's father was a collector, he would have had documentation. And if Eva was smart enough to attach the coins to the belt, she would've known to bring the papers with her. Damhnaic's gone through all of his paperwork looking for forgotten accounts, savings bonds... He really liked these puzzle boxes you see everywhere. Hidden places. What's the story? Mom, this one's bulging. It's German. Oh, I read German. Bubbi taught me. It's a loan agreement for a house purchase in Berlin. Eva's parent's house. Well, why would she have kept an old loan agreement? What did they use for collateral? A coin collection. Including three 1804 Bust Collar coins. It was real. Eva had them. Oh. Do you wanna talk about it? What do you want me to say? Mom, I've learned more about my life in the last few days than I ever did from you. Well, some stories are just better left buried. Things forgotten. Over and over. It was a scary time for me back then, Tess. I was worried I'd made all the wrong decisions. But, you know, we did okay in the end, right? You never went hungry. You had your nan. I wasn't there as much as I wanted to be but one of us had to make a living. And you chose you. No. Your nan did that. I asked to stay and she said she was tired of always being on the road. I mean, I wanted to be in two places at one time, but... But you weren't. You never came back. I came back a lot, Tess. But you preferred your grandmother. You punished me for going. I mean, I made mistakes, a lot of them. But... look at you now. You're a gorgeous, successful, independent woman with a job you love. We're not that different. We are. We are different. Come on, Tess. What if I don't want your life? What if there's a way to live where you're not racing from place to place just leaving people in your wake? Actually stay somewhere, get to know a community. I'm afraid if I keep going like this I'm gonna end up like you. Yeah, okay. Mom... No, you do that. You grab the life that you want. Then maybe you can stop blaming me for your choices. Hi, you've reached Isabel. I'm probably out in the orchard so leave... Hey. It's me. Dublin? Tess? You in there? - Hey. - Hey. Thanks for coming, I didn't know who else to call. You must be freezing. Here. The rain blows up around here. Hey... are you okay? Magnus, uh, went to Dublin in 2003 to see me, I guess. It was the year my nan died, so my mom took me out on the road with her. He missed you. What if I could've known him? What if I could've known this place? And the lives they built? Now my only connection to it is trying to save it. Save it from foreclosure. I know. What if we can't? You can't control how things turn out, Tess. I thought I'd stay in the Navy, until my plane went down on a mission. I was wounded but honorably discharged and got to come home. Whatever happens, it's gonna be okay, Tess. Do you miss it? The danger, the risk? You know what I miss? I miss being challenged. The way you talk about your work. Your fire, your excitement about that big promotion. That's what I miss. It's changing, the job. It's not what I thought. It's less travel, less time with clients. It's managerial. Is that what you want? I don't know. I thought I had everything all figured out and, and then I came here and I. I breathe differently here. I breathe! Yeah. And I feel closer to myself than I've ever felt. But tomorrow I'm going back to Sheffield's and Antique Row. Antiques Row... what? - Dolores Street. - Huh? Uh, It's... Dolores Street, it's it's where Antiques Row is in San Francisco. I think I know what happened to the coins. Erik had them. Uh... My father, my father had the coins! Erik knew that my mom was pregnant, right? And he said that he'd take care of her. Then he asks her to meet at a diner on Dolores Street? It's 90 percent antique shops. It has been for the last 50 years. You think he had access to the coins and was gonna sell them? To take care of us. I gotta talk to my mom. Mom, what was the name of the diner on Dolores Street? The one Erik suggested the day he wanted to meet? Dolores Street. Yeah. Antiques Row. Um Erik had the coins. Maybe he wanted to give them to you or I don't know, sell them to help. Do you remember what it was called? Delilah's. It's right next to Precious Treasures and Antiques. I do business with them, they deal in coins. I'm coming with you. I can fly you. But there's only room for one. Oh, you go. I drove from the airport. Go. I'm just... I'm gonna tell Isabel what's going on. I can't believe that this is actually happening. Well, I don't want you to get your hopes up but I'll keep you posted. Okay? Okay. - Hey, Tess. - Yeah? I never had a mother growing up. It's all I ever wanted. I know this thing with your mom is complicated. It is. But she's family. And family. Is everything. I know, that's what Magnus always said. I'm trying. Well, I'll... I will try. I'll try. - Okay. - Okay. I really hope this works out. - I'll let you know. - Okay. What's the plan? Head to Precious Treasures and Antiques and see if they have a record of Erik being there 30 years ago. - It's a long shot, but... - Anything's possible. And then what? What if this works and Bella Vista's saved, hmm? I can't think about that right now. I... it just feels like everything's so uncertain. I didn't mean to make it harder. No... you didn't. The... the... The grape stomp, flying, the horseback riding, it's they've all been... Me too. Maybe not the horseback riding. Well, you're a beginner. Well, it ended with your ex who did not seem happy to see me. She's fine. I mean, we're fine. It's been six years. I guess I just can't picture the two of you together. Uh, we burned out pretty fast. We realized early on we weren't meant to be. You want a different life now? I have a different life now. And I want different things. North Three Six Five One November on approach. Permission to land. I can get us a ride into town. No, I am... Look, everything you've done has been incredible but I think that... I just... You don't have to take this next step alone. Hey. Where are you? Hey. I thought I called Lydia's phone. You did. We're in labor! What? Are you here? We're at St. John's. The baby's early! Room 3328. Come! Are your hands clean? You don't have a cough or anything, do you? It was a private plane and I washed my hands. Come meet your godson, Noah. Hi Noah. Here. - Support his head. - Mm hmm. - Cover his feet, it's cold. - Ok. You made a family. Congratulations, Tess. The job yours. This is the part where you say I'm thrilled! Thank you, Ms. Sheffield, this job is a dream come true. Thank you, Ms. Sheffield. It is a dream come true. But I wonder if you could give me a few more days to give you an answer? So, what did she say? Are we moving to New York? Did she offer you the job? Or... or are you taking somebody else? No, of course not. Kiley, you're the best assistant ever. So? You really wanna pick up everything and move to New York? I mean, to work in the flagship of one of the best auction houses in the world and live in the center of the universe I mean, don't you, Tess? I got a lot to think about. I gotta go, I'll see you later. Hey, Ben. Tess! Bring me something good? Actually just a question. Erik Johansen made an appointment on Christmas Eve but my records say he didn't show. Did he say what he was bringing? Three 1804 Bust Collar Class 1 coins. Do you know where they are? Not yet. And none have come on the market that you know of? No. But one other note in the calendar. We got a call later that day from a Carlos Calderon who wanted to complete the transaction. Carlos. Erik's best friend. He didn't have the proper papers so we wouldn't have bought them. We never heard from him again. So, at the time of Erik's death, Carlos had a gambling habit. Owed money to some very nasty people. And apparently after the accident he disappeared and no one has seen him since. You think... If Erik had the coins at the time of the accident then it would make sense for Carlos to try to sell them. He couldn't though. You think he went black market? Given how plugged in we are to that market, we'd have heard. And without the authentication papers he wouldn't have been able to. I think Carlos hit the road so the people he owed money to would never be able to find him. So we're back at zero. Unless the wife or his daughter know something. Isabel said when Carlos left they had to move out of the house with the clothes on their backs and just a few trinkets. Lourdes. Lourdes? Can we talk? I heard a lot of stories about my Papi. That he was trouble, that he took off for terrible reasons. I'm not here to bring up bad memories. But I only have a few of his things. Is the belt one of them? If he did leave me something that would be all I have of him. But it wasn't his. If he did have it, he didn't come by it rightly. No, just... Lourdes, wait, please. You know these people. You know how caring they are, how much they matter to each other. So please, if you have the belt, do the right thing. It's the only way to save the orchard. I saw Lourdes walking away. I think I blew it. No. Does she have the belt? I think so. I don't think she's gonna hand it over. - Let me talk to her. - No. No, no, no. You've already done enough, I don't wanna drag you any further in. Tess... you don't know how far I'm already in. Hm? Will you drive me back to the main house? Of course. I could stay. You know, be a sounding board from the bank's perspective. It's okay. Or, just be here for you. Tess? I got offered the job at Sheffield's. The deputy directorship in New York. That's, uh... ah, congratulations. You're taking it? I think I have to. I mean, I'll stay until we get an answer from Lourdes. And then... And then... you'll... be done here? I'll come back to visit. Right. Um... Well, keep me posted. I mean, you have to, um, because I'm the executor, but I'll find you. Thanks Damhnaic. Can't we do something like a subpoena? I mean, I hate to force her but it's not hers. Sometimes... we hold onto things for the wrong reasons. I wanted to believe that my father left me something because he loved me. But the only reason he would leave something this valuable behind is because he couldn't figure out how to sell it. Tess was right. Your family's legacy is worth much more than one awful man. They're not here. What? See these clasps? The coins have been removed. My father took them with him? He must have, right? No, he must've known the truth. Eva's treasure is in this house. Magnus said so. We're not giving up. Come on. Okay. Eva had to have given Erik the coins. To support you and your mother. Right. But then after he died, then what happened to them? Well, she knew that Carlos was in the car with our father and she knew Carlos, so maybe she went to him? But if I wound up with the belt, he didn't give it to her. Right, but you wound up with the belt, not the coins. We're just grasping at straws here because if Bubbi did have the coins she would've given them to Pop to help save the orchard. And Carlos Calderon did not have a sympathetic bone in his body. He never would've just handed them over. Carlos Calderon. CC. Maybe, just maybe, painting under a painting. - What? - Pentimento. What's going on? Art with a secret. Come on. Pops, I have a feeling. Come on. Eva got the coins back from Carlos. There was a letter in there too. He said that he was sorry for taking the coins and he hoped it wasn't too late to get them to my mother. He also said that he wanted Lourdes to know how much he loved her. I think she has some peace now, knowing that after all, her father did the right thing. And that the orchard is saved. You still sure you wanna sign it all away? Tess? I have to go back to San Francisco. You really quit? Yes. But I also explained to Sheffield that she doesn't need a deputy director for the job she's describing. No, what she needs is an organizational genius. Someone who knows everyone who calls, what their secrets are, kills at research and scheduling. And also happens to be the most amazing person on the planet. Tess! She won't give you the Deputy Director title, but how does Associate Director of Operations in New York City sound? Like, do you even have to ask? Oh, my gosh! You earned this. - Tess, I... - Oh, and I'm proud of you. Wait, that's all you're taking? Uh, yeah. Maybe you'll send the rest? Sure. But to where? And I quit. Because I think I came up with a better plan. What is it? With your permission, I would like to give the coins to Sheffield to sell as an independent broker. We can use the proceeds to pay off the bank and there'll still be plenty left over for the running of this place and we can guarantee the workers their jobs. And you and I can split the commission to start our own businesses. Our own businesses... what businesses? Well, you're gonna open a cooking school for kids, obviously. But before you do that, I think you have to go to Italy, North Africa, Greece and... what was the other one? - Thailand. - Thailand, right. Thailand. So that you can bring back all that knowledge and flavor. And teach? Tess, wow. Uh, wait, what is your business? If it's okay with you, I'd really like to reopen our Bubbi's shop. I wanna call it "Things Remembered". Instead of Things Forgotten. 'Cause it turns out nothing was forgotten. Just delayed. - Thank you. - Yeah. Wow. This is... no, wait. With both of us getting all these new businesses off the ground who's gonna run the day-to-day here? I have an idea about that too. So... what's up? Well, I have something to ask you. Isabel and I have been talking about the future. Not just for ourselves but for the orchard, for Magnus and Eva's legacy. Okay, and...? And I think that you should be the one to run the day-to-day operations going forward. What? You want me to quit my job at the bank and run Bella Vista? Well, you worked the orchard for years, and Magnus mentored you. He chose you to handle Bella Vista's finances, uh, be his executor. Come on, you said you wanted a new adventure. A challenge. Honestly, I thought that was gonna be you. Well, as it turns out, I quit my job at Sheffield. And I'm gonna reopen Eva's shop and I'm moving here. I'll still have my place in San Francisco. Right. So you can run if you need to. No, I think I'm done running for a while. I'm gonna try and stand still and, you know, breathe. - Really? - Hm. Well... I can barely breathe. I can't believe you did this for us. Excuse me. A year ago I wouldn't have put a $2 bet on you doing this. Me neither. I'm so proud of you. And I promise I'll be here, be in touch, be better at all that. Turns out having family around is everything. Thanks, Mom. So who do I talk to about buying something? Right over here. That's okay, I think I can sort you out. Look what you did. Hmm? What you did. How you found me. You got me to come out here when I didn't want to. Hmm. Thanks for the best year of my life. ♪ I see your face in the setting sun ♪ ♪ And the open road leads me back to you ♪ ♪ Back to you ♪ ♪ From coming home to you ♪ ♪ I'm coming home to you ♪
