** ** [Woman's Voice] The deal was simple. Buy the drugs at one-tenth the street value, and sell them and make a bundle. We knew the drugs were stolen. We knew it was dangerous. But that's why I came. [ motorcycle engines ] [ footsteps ] [ chains breaking, gate creaking] Come on, give me a little taste. [ laughs ] Ray! So how come Speed ain't here? Heather, damn it! Ugh, why do you deny me? Some other guys... Wouldn't put up with your shit. Here, dopey. I think the guera should stay here. She just came to get high! Why do you keep calling me that? Shit, a god damn cat fight! Shut up, pendejo! [ door creaks open ] You coming, Pole? [ door creaks shut ] [ lighter flicks on ] [ footsteps echo ] [ loud scraping noise ] [ yelling ] Would you quit fucking around?! Hey! [ laughs ] Would you cut it out please?! [ heavy breathing ] Can't you do something about her? This isn't a game! I'm not gonna fucking die because of you. Heather! This isn't a place for stupid rich girls. [ footsteps echo ] [door creaks open ] Maybe Speed rigged the lights. He's a dope dealer, fool, not a roadie! Yeah, well... Wait up. Wait up. Okay, Judd, you and you three go that way. We're gonna go over here. Shit, Speed ain't even here! Go, go, go man. [ footsteps, scraping ] [ creepy music ] [ door creaks open ] [ roar ] [ laughter ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ panting ] I love you, Heather. [ panting ] What you gonna do with your share? Me? I'm gonna open up a coffee house. One of those nice ones with style. Serve food, live music. Great. Hey, sounds good! Stupid assholes. You should be doing what my cousin Hector does. He's got his money in no-load mutual funds. I've got your load for you. Shut up, dickhead. What are those? I don't know, but he's got a pinche Lexus. What's going on? Where's Speed? I'm going to the bathroom. [ door opens, shuts ] [ creepy music ] [ creepy music ] [ door creaks ] [ door shuts ] [ door creaks ] [ rat squeaks ] [ urinating ] [ door creaks ] [ scream ] [ punch ] [ cries ] Shit! Oh man! Hey, man! Are you OK? What happened, man?! I'm just trying to use the fucking can, man! Fucking bitch! Okay, fourteen. Fourteen five. [ interrupting ] Thirteen. Thirteen five. Um... [ stuttering ] fifteen. Twelve! Would you shut up?! [ laughter ] Um... fuck it! It's all there, man. [ laughter ] [ cash rustling ] Slow down there, Speed. Where's the stuff, huh? Do I know you? Are we pals, huh? This is quality ice, man. Very little color. Very little, very little. And it's close. It's real close, man. What are you doing? Hey! [ engines revving ] Shit! We got company! [ engine turns off ] [ intense music ] [ running ] [ Speed whimpering ] No way, man. No fucking way. [ door slams ] Ray, let's just get out of here. Don't listen to her! That 20,000 might be chump change to you, but it's everything we had. [ Speed whimpering ] Suki! Shut the fuck up. It's our money, we have to get it. What about the crew down there? We hide. They don't even know we're here. Oh yeah? They just parked next to our god damn bikes! Judd, look. You and I are gonna go downstairs. We're gonna check things out. Maybe we can still get the money. Look, man! If we can't, at least we can look for a way to escape. Heather, You and Suki are gonna stay here with Pole. No, I'm coming with you! No, I said you're gonna stay here. Please don't make this any harder than it already is. I'm not leaving this place without you. [ door opens ] Fuck. Yeah. [ Speed choking ] What are we supposed to use to protect ourselves? Speed took your gun. Now, this plan bites, man. Real bad. Listen to this candy-ass! You want some, man?! Knock it off! Knock it off! Now look! We're gonna use what we have, OKAY? You got it? [ Speed screaming ] [ scared breathing ] Ray, don't do this, please. We can all hide until they leave. She's right. Yeah, and what about our money?! Man, when did you become so afraid? Look, I just don't like shitty odds! [ Pole laughing ] Look man, we ain't gonna wait here for them to find us. okay? Now, let's go. Heather, it's something we gotta do. I'm sorry I got you into all this. [ screaming ] Stay here. [ Speed whimpering ] That toilet doesn't flush. Can we get on with this, please? My parents are expecting us for dinner. Jesus Christ. Okay, Speed. So you took the stuff... Speed: I was gonna pay you, man... Say it Speed. "I took what didn't belong to me." Speed: I was gonna pay you! You took a kilo out of stock without telling anyone. You stole from us. That's really the point here, isn't it? I was gonna pay! I see that. That's what this is for, right? Gotta be fifteen, twenty grand there. What do you think, Bobby? Bobby: Twenty thousand bucks. Twenty thousand dollars? But a kilo's gotta be worth thirty-five? Forty in the current market value, and with a kicker to cover transportation, storage overruns. That's fifty. And you've got twenty here. So, help me with the math, Bobby. Bobby: About thirty thousand short. Thirty thousand dollars. You notice how I didn't ask Nicky to do the math? You know what I think? I think you were trying to fuck us. Speed: No, man, I was trying to pay you... Shut up! Which brings me to my next point... Where is my father's property, Speed? Speed: No! No! I was gonna get the rest of the money, Dan. I was really... [ Speed screaming ] [ whimpering ] [ quiet footsteps ] You know? You haven't been very nice to us. You also seem to think that we're stupid! Speed: No, man! You know, I don't think that you respect us. [ snap ] [ gunshot ] Why in the fuck did you do that? Snapping means "hurt," you asshole. Pointing is "kill." Shit. Now how will we find the stuff? Don't worry, Dan, we'll find it. Now fucking do what he says! [ creepy music ] [ electricity crackling ] [ Pole flicking lighter ] [ quiet footsteps ] [ footsteps ] Has Ralph disabled the motorcycles? It's taken care of. How many others do you think there are? Three bikes, who knows? Great. [ scary music ] Judd: All of the doors are sealed and there's bars on the windows. What about the front entrance? One of them's watching it. Fuck this, fuck the money. Man, let's go back upstairs. We're not gonna get it, let's go. Come on! [ intense music ] [ rattling ] [ crash ] [ punching ] [ knife whooshing ] [ knife whooshing ] [ crashing ] [ grunting ] [ slam ] [ slamming ] [ punching ] [ pipes clanging ] Come on, fucker! Come on. Come on! [ hitting ] Nicky! [ running ] [ pipe clanging ] You alright, man? [ running ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] Get the fuck out of there, you wormy little fucker. -Easy. -Fuck! -Easy. [ screaming ] That's enough. [ thud ] [ grunting ] [ punching ] This is bullshit! What have you been doing down there all this time? Trying not to get caught. Well, pretty soon they're gonna start looking up here. We should've hid. There are a lot of rooms, it'll take them a long time... And then what? We go from room to room like rats? They'll stay here as long as it takes and eventually they'll find us. When Ray gets back... -Ray is dead, pendejo . No, he's not! Where are you going? Are you crazy? We can't go down there. I'm not leaving him! Look, he made his choice. This whole thing was his idea. Look, we have to go after him, but you stay here. No! Fine. You want to be a pinche hero? Jesus. Look at you, you stupid gavacho. You know what a Mexican man does? He protects his own, no matter what. Look, I am not... -Mexican? Not even close. Why I ever hooked up with you... I just came to make a buy. Alone? [ choking ] Then why are there three motorcycles outside? [ footsteps. creepy music ] I want those drugs. Bobby: This is getting it slowly. Let me make this simple. Either you take us to where the drugs are, or we kill you. After that, we'll find the others and we'll kill them. Is that plain enough for you? Sure. [ footsteps ] [ clanging ] [ slow footsteps ] You like art? I just bought this incredible book on Italian painting. I'm giving it to my parents tonight for their anniversary. Look, this is just business. You know I went to USC? I was an econ major. Speed, you little piece of shit. What the hell were you doing? Now, Bobby, look at him. The man's exhausted. He's got a wife, two kids to go home to. But we all have to work despite our disadvantages. Mine happens to be a good education. I don't care what they say, it doesn't prepare you. Do you know where you're going? Yeah. You know I can't believe you two guys are taking orders from this little prick. Some guy put him in charge? No, I know what it is. You pretend to listen when he talks in that stupid voice. But you'd kill him in a second. [ rustling ] The old man had a stroke and little wet-ass here steps in. And then junior takes over the family business. With his good shoes and high voice... Shut your fucking mouth! [ punching ] [ inhaling ] [ exhaling ] [ grunt ] [ grunting ] Now that the old man's out of the picture, you'd go back to sleeping with mommy? [ laughing ] [ scary music ] [ gunshot ] I think we'd better call your father. Nicky, get the gun under the desk. Under the desk, you Neanderthal. I'm gonna get the others. I'll go. Don't argue with me, god damn it. I want those drugs. Let's just get through this, okay? Just before I fired... I had a vision. Come on, I need you, kid. Hey Ralph! It's Rif. Whatever man. Cover the door, okay? [ coughing ] [ sniffling ] They shot Ray. These assholes could be anywhere. We're wasting time. Why don't we burn down the building? Oh great, and the drugs with it? Let's look around some more, then you and Ed can go to the party. We can finish up here. Yeah right. No, we need to search this place room by room. I think you should think it over. I don't need your advice. Okay? Whatever you want, Dan. [ quiet footsteps ] [ electricity crackling ] Oh my god. The bullet didn't go in. [ crying ] Come on, I'll help you up. [ moaning ] Stop it. [ weakly ] Always gotta be moving forward. Life is short. Ssh. I'll be fine. I left before, Heather. I should've called, there's no money. The way things are going... Heather, hurry up. Come on. Come on, get up. Ray, come on! Heather, where's Heather? Ssh. I'm right here. [ spanish ] Mierda. [ breathing ] [ doorknob rattling ] Okay, what's the story? Nobody got in or out. Look, Nicky. I don't want any of your stupid bullshit. We find the drugs, right? You were gonna keep this, weren't you? You dumb piece of shit hayseed! You know, you're full of it as usual, Judd! I'm saving our lives. Don't you hear what they said? This is all they want! Now, I give it over, and we walk out of here! Charlie, you don't know nothing! Oh no? I'm the fucking hero! Look at him. He wants to hide like a scared little baby. But I'm the one who's gonna save all your sorry asses. You should be lining up to suck my dick! Now, is anybody coming with me? [ silence ] You bunch of goddamn losers. You're all gonna die in here. Look, his big mouth is gonna get us killed. You better go after him. This is that Mexican man thing again, isn't it? I want you to wait out in the car, okay? For what? [ sigh ] I just don't want anything to happen to you, okay? Now go on. Go! Fuck no. I don't need you to take care of me, all right? I don't need anybody. Goddamn self-sufficient, badass motherfucker. Who doesn't need his stupid-ass paranoid brother watching him all the time. [ coughing ] Shh. [ coughing ] Could you help me? [ coughing continues ] -Ssh. It's just some saliva. [ screech ] [ creepy music ] Now, I don't think you really wanna shoot me. [ lighter flicks ] Especially since I just happen to know where the rest of them crystals are. Interested? I don't particularly want to talk to you, though. You get me someone in charge. Dan, over here! I got one of them! I tracked him over here. I was gonna blow his fucking head off if he made a move. [ punch ] I was fucking brilliant, man. Yeah, whatever. So anyway, I got what you boys want. Now, I give it over, I walk out of here, right? Right? That's right. We just want what belongs to us. That's what I thought. Hey, let me see your gun. Nah, come on now! I got nothing against you boys. In fact I was thinking maybe I could be of service, you know, in the future? That's enough. Let's go. [ male laughs] [ door opening ] Let's see if I remember now. This is it. This is it! Stuff's up there in that box. So that's it, right? I can walk out of here? I want you to tell me how many others there are. Now I'll be happy as shit to tell you just as soon as I'm outside, nice and safe. [ Dan snaps ] [ gunshot ] Aah! [ screaming ] Are you crazy?! What'd you do that for?! [ screaming ] -How many others? How many?! You can suck on it, asshole! [ gunshot ] [ screaming ] I fucked your money! You college-educated piece of dog shit! Okay! Okay! Okay! There's one more! One other guy! No! No God! No! Please! [ multiple gunshots ] You fucked it up! I'm going back down there. I figure I can distract them long enough to get outside. Even if I can't get to my motorcycle, I can run. I'll get to a pay phone, I'll call the cops. It'll all be over. You're crazy. Look, I can do this. They're not that smart. I'll make it, Suki. You and Heather stay here, don't make a sound. They don't know that you're up here. [ coughing ] Judd, what are you doing? I'm taking care of my own. [ sad music ] [ music ] [ coughing ] Christ, now what? [ vomiting ] [ gagging ] [ dripping ] [ groaning ] [ paper ripping ] [ intense music ] [ intense music ] [ door opening ] It's wrong. I have to find Judd. Heather, if one of them finds you, you use this. [ music ] [ metal rattling ] [ music stops ] [ breathing ] [ footsteps ] [ gate slamming ] [ intense music ] [ Judd yelling ] [ metal banging ] Where is she?! Where is she?! Tell me where she is! [ Judd screaming ] [ screaming continues ] [ footsteps, dragging ] [ music ] [ music ] [ quiet crying ] God, I hate LA. [ coughing ] Jesus, what? Nicky. Okay. He's the last one. We can go. I'll find Nicky. Where's Ed? [ bangs on door ] [ whimpering ] [ bangs on door ] [ whimpering, breathing ] [ banging repeatedly ] [ banging repeatedly ] [ banging repeatedly ] [ banging repeatedly ] [ banging continues ] [ door opens ] [ door closes ] [ banging ] [ suspenseful music ] [ cocking gun ] [ whacking ] [ pipe clanging ] I don't wanna kill you. You don't wanna kill me. You're the one that's gonna die. [ laughing ] I don't wanna kill you. I don't wanna kill you. [ screams ] What are you gonna do, huh? Cry? [ whack ] You stupid bitch! [ whack ] [ splashing, bubbling ] [ bubbling stops ] [ gunshot ] [ gasping, coughing ] We have to go now. They know we're here. [ music ] [ coughing ] Quick, we'll take him up the back stairs. Pull him up! 1, 2, 3, up! [ shuffling ] Come on! We're too slow. No, Heather, we gotta go. Heather, we better get the F- up the stairs. Let's go. Now. Let's go. -Wait. -Wait for what? Now! [ music stops ] Jesus. No no no. Come on, Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed. Ed. Oh Jesus. He's choking - he's choking on something. Okay. Ed! Ed! God damn it! Bobby: Dan, leave it alone. Not today. Okay. I got him. I can save him. You piece of fucking shit! You stupid fucker! [ screams ] God damn piece of shit! Dan! God damn it, let him go! Leave it alone. Dan! Let it go. [ grunting ] Okay. Bobby, Nicky, get Raf and meet me at the front. I want them all dead. I'll keep looking up here. [ door slams ] You're not getting out of here! You think this is some kind of game? Now you listen to me. You primitive piece of rogue crap. You don't have a life! You don't have an agenda! What do you want to do with the body? Okay. Okay. [ dialing ] Dad? Um, I really need to talk to you. And um... Jesus. Um, call me back, Okay? Call me back. DIE, YOU SON OF A BITCH! FUCK! [ crashing ] [ breathing ] Bobby. Bobby. [ crying ] [ panting ] [ grunting ] Maybe Judd made it. I couldn't do it. You have to! They don't care about anything. Do you understand? They will kill us all. It doesn't matter to them. When I was 17, I had never fired a gun, and then I had to kill someone. It was like this impulse inside me I didn't even know I had. I just did it. Didn't feel like anything. I just did. I have to get the cell phone. He can't save you. [ coughing ] Sssshhhh. I don't care if you've got fucking cancer, get your ass inside. That's what we pay you for. Not to do this. Alright, alright. Leave it out. [ bottle cap loosening ] [ intense music ] [ shells clicking ] [ coughing ] [ shotgun cocking ] [ suspenseful music ] Heather: I don't know if this means anything... But I love you too Ray. I do, oh God, I do. This fucking bullet can't stop us. And these assholes can't stop us either. [ intense music ] We'll ride forever, baby. We'll make it. Bobby: Nicky, where are you? Bobby: Nicky! You gotta be strong for me now, Ray. Why don't we wait for them outside? That's not the plan. We finish this now. Look, let's just follow the plan. This is gonna take all fucking night. Hey, where's Ed? [ indecipherable yelling ] Back off! Back off! Come on then! Come on! What's the matter with you two? [ yelling ] Shut up and back off, both of you, dammit! Now let's just finish this! Now Ralph, get your ass upstairs and check it again. It's "Ralph," you degenerate pimp. You're with me. [ breathing ] [ banging ] [ crying ] [ banging ] [ rattling ] [ crying ] [ music ] [ banging ] Oh, fuck it! [ distant coughing ] [ bag rustling ] [ coughing ] [ sniffing ] [ music intensifies ] [ gunshots, richochets ] [ coughing ] Oh, shit. I want that phone, you fucker! Sure. [ gunshots, running ] [ gunshots ] [ footsteps, labored breathing ] [ coughing ] [ banging ] [ sneezing ] [ spraying ] [ panting ] If I make you a hostage, will they let us out of here? Yeah, right. Until one of them could get a clean shot. We're not part of this, we just want out. Do you think he cares? [ crying ] Empty your pockets. Is this getting you off? Shut up. How are you gonna tie me up? [ breathing ] Why don't you just kill me and get it over with? You think I'm like you? [ whacking ] [ gunshots ] [ gun jamming ] [ gunshots ] Fuck! [ grunting ] I told you. Give me that phone. Give- [ gunshots ] Dan, are you alright? Yeah. Bitch. [ coughing ] Nicky. Nicky! Nicky! Bobby, something's wrong with Nicky. I thought you said you could control him. Nicky won't leave here alive. I'll put him down tonight. What went wrong? Bad luck, I guess. That's it? No. It wasn't a good plan. This is my fault. No. Oh Jesus. What am I gonna tell my father? Dan, I want you to go to the car. We'll clean this up. Tell my dad it wasn't my fault. Okay? I'll tell your dad how you tried to protect Ed. Don't worry. [ creepy music ] [ choking ] [ crying ] [ gunshots ] [ stumbling ] [ gunshots ] [ spanish ] Mierda! [ Dan falling ] [ breathing ] [ gate sliding open ] [ electricity crackles ] [ breathing ] [ running ] [ phone ringing ] [ bang ] [ intense music ] [ struggling ] [ door slamming ] [ music stops ] [ grunting ] [ breathing ] [ crying ] [ creepy music ] He'll kill us all. [ breathing ] Why aren't we dead? I don't know. You were like a guerrera. A what? A warrior. [ laughing ] From one of those Mexican movies on TV. [ slamming ] [ screaming ] [ shotgun blast ] [ thud ] [ silence ] [ bag rustling ] [ gasp ] [ scary music ] Ray. Ray! [ echoes ] [ running ] [ door closing ] [ footsteps, breathing ] [ wood creaking ] [ electricity crackling ] [ breathing ] He'll kill us all. [ shirt ripping ] [ distant voice ] [ music intensifies ] [ music stops ] Run. [ intense music ] [ shotgun blast ] [ struggling ] [ cutting ] [ scary music ] [ groaning ] [ police sirens ] [ helicopter ] Ma'am, how many of them were there? I just came to get high. [ radio chatter ] The day you die feels just like any other day. That dark and rancid building on the edge of nowhere, that is where I died. Now I know death isn't an ending, but a beginning. A door to a place within yourself, deep within your soul. The day you die, that's the day you know who you really are. **
