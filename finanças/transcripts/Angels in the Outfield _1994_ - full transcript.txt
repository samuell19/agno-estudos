Roger, do you believe in heaven? I guess. That's where they say my mom went. - Maybe that's where my dad went. - Probably. Hey, maybe your mom and my dad are friends up there. - That could be. - 'Cause you're my best friend down here. You're my best friend too, J.P. Roger, how come Maggie's house is called a foster home? I don't know. Maybe the first people who let other people's kids live with them were named "Foster." Oh. So if we stay there a long time, do we gotta change our name to Foster? - No way. - Good. Besides, we're not gonna be there a long time. - Really? - Yeah, somethin' good's gonna happen. Yeah, somethin' good. Maybe today, even. It could happen. The Angels, trying to break a 14-game losing streak, face the Toronto Blue Jays here this afternoon at Anaheim Stadium. Maggie, we're back. So, where ya been? Just ridin' around. You said be back by 5:00. I can't tell time yet. Are we back by 5:00? Close. Come on, J.P., get your bike in. Roger? - Yeah? - You have a visitor. He's waiting inside for you. Is it... - Dad? - Hey. - Dad! - Surprised to see me? Yeah. You look kinda scrawny. Don't they feed you enough in this place? Yeah. - Where you been? I was waitin'. - Just ridin' around the stadium. - Angels still your team? - Yeah. They're in last place. Yeah. Runs in the blood. Family that likes losers. So... I came to say... that I'm goin' up north. I know I said when I came it'd be to get you, but... things ain't workin' out that way. I did what I could with ya. Maybe if your mom was alive it'd be different. I, uh... They had me sign this thing, this paper. Some kind of release thing. Uh, just gotta go to court to make it final. You understand what I'm sayin', don't ya? Y-Yeah. Okay, I'm glad we got that outta the way. Where's the pickup? I traded it in. The bike's better for travelin'. Dad, when we gonna be a family again? From where I'm sittin', I'd say when the Angels win the pennant. You stay outta trouble, son. Number 27, shortstop, Steve Acker. So with the Angels down by seven, it's now one ball, two strikes to Acker, - the fourth batter to face Gates here in the eighth. - Come on, strike him out! Yeah! Strike him out! And got Godchaux on a pop-up to Mitchell at third. Burn it in there. Come on, Angels, let's stay in this. Gates takes the sign, checks the runner at first and delivers. Acker lobs the ball high into left field. Gates, you stink! Norton and Williams both going for the catch. - I-I got it. I got it. - And this will be Ben Williams' call. And Williams and Norton collide and the catch is blown! - Where's the ball? Uuh! - Ooh! Boy, they're bad! - Ohh! - And with another example... of his infamous temper, manager George Knox calls time out. He will have a word with his pitcher, Frank Gates. I don't think it's gonna be a happy word. And it looks like Knox is going to take Gates out. Gates doesn't look too pleased about this. - Gimme the ball. - It ain't my fault. You need a new outfield. You're outta here! Give me the ball! You want the ball? Here you go. Go get it! - Gates has thrown his ball and glove into the stands. - My glove? Go get it! Go on, get outta here! You're finished, Gates! - And Knox has attacked his own pitcher! - Uh oh! Skip, Skip. Let 'em go, Skip. - You're washed up! You'll never pitch again! - You're crazy, Knox! They're clearing the benches! Now both teams are on the field. Hey! It's not our fight! - George Knox has created total chaos! - Huh? What? - Hit him one for me, Gates! - I can't find him! - You're crazy! - You can't manage a team! This is outrageous! George Knox fighting off his own players, Surprise, surprise. And they're trying to keep Knox and Gates apart. You stink, Knox! Knox, you're outta here! Come on, ump, leave him in! Yeah! Don't throw him out! - Hey! What are you kids doin' up there? - Uh-oh! You better have tickets for that tree! Game's over for us, J.P. We gotta go! That's right, clear off! Go on, get outta here! You heard me! Don't let me catch you twerps around here again! - You kickin' me out? That's good! - Yes, I'm kicking you out! - 'Cause you been stinkin' up the calls all day! - You're gone! You can't kick me out 'cause I'm leavin'. You get that? I'm outta here! And Knox will watch the rest of the game... in the locker room. Murphy's out of his mind to put up with this nonsense. - You think you can do any better? - Blindfolded. Well, when you were managing, boy, you had a lot of trouble. I remember... Zip it, pal. You have to ask yourself, what is goin' on... with this team, and how long will owner Hank Murphy put up... with this kind of behavior from his manager. I thought I'd seen it all, ladies and gentlemen, but with George Knox calling the shots, you never know what will happen. Careful, J.P. Let's go! - Why do you idiots do that after we've lost? - It's for good luck, man. After 15 straight losses, I say we find somethin' else to rub. - Like Triscuit's head. - Don't even think about touchin' me... anywhere. - Fatty pants. - Maybe we should do this before we lose. Aw, not again! They got the wrong kind of salami! - It was nice of Knox to let you play. - Hey, I can hit it. You gotta, you gotta choke up and bear down, then you'll get your homer. - Hey, how's the arm? - It's feelin' strong. You'll be pitchin' no-hitters any day now. ♪ We are the boys of summer and it's a big bummer ♪ ♪ No matter who we play we give the game away ♪ ♪ 'Cause we can't win that would be a sin ♪ - ♪ We even lose the games before they begin ♪ - Save it, Mapel! - Bummer. - One more loss! One more loss which could have been a win! You call yourselves professionals. I have never seen a worse group of 25 players! You don't think as a team, you don't play as a team, you don't even lose as a team! You all got your heads so far up your butts... you can't even see the light of day! One more loss and I'll, and I'll do this! Aah! To each and every one of you! Ho-ho-ho! I want you here, in uniform, at 9:00 tomorrow. We're going back to work on fundamentals! Fundamentals? In the middle of the season? I thought the game started at 1:00. It does start at 1:00. And you're a jackass! No, I'm a pitcher. - I think you're a pitcher and jackass. - Si. It's very common. Oh. Tough loss, George. I can't take it anymore. You have to start trading 'em. All of them, now. - I can't trade 25 players. - I can't win with these guys. Nobody can. There's a thing called talent. They don't have it. This isn't Cincinnati, George. No one expects you to win big with these boys. I came here to manage a winning baseball team. You just hang on, partner. You'll ride through the dark days. Mr. Knox, we're waiting on the field. We're waiting. What's that? David Montagne, administrative assistant for media relations. You're scheduled to do Ranch Wilder's postgame show here, and he's been waiting. The press are all scum. They're meant to be kept waiting. - Ranch Wilder's worse than scum. - Who's fault is that? That is not my fault. What ever happened to Barney or Bailey, or whatever the jerk's name is? You fired him and they hired me on Monday. Then I can't officially fire you until Friday. Make a note. Uh, where, where, where? All right, all right. Microphone? Thrown out of the game. I imagine the commissioner's finally happy. We're on in three, two, one. And we're back with Angels' manager George Knox. This was a tough loss today. - Any loss is hard. - But this one really got to you. You leave Cincinnati after ten years of winning ball clubs, although the really big one... always seemed to be just out of reach, and you come out here to manage our Angels. Now, expectations were high that you could turn this team around, but that just doesn't seem to be happening. - Season's only half over, Ranch. - And your club's in last place. You oughta know how one incident can change the course of events. Well, you know, you play the game, you take your chances. - Sometimes you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. - Yeah, you're an expert at that. - I could say the same about you. - Well, actions speak louder than words. - Well, that'll wrap things up here in the field… - Hey, I'm still on the air here. Oh, yeah? Ooh! We're speaking with Angels' manager George Knox. George? And, uh, we'll be right back. Oh, Roger, you haven't eaten a thing. I'm not hungry. Miguel, you have to miss the baseball game tomorrow I'm sorry, your social worker called and you have an interview. She'll be here at 11:00. Good, I don't want to go to the game anyway. Angels never win. I want to go to the game. They could win. It could happen. Yeah, and you could drop dead after dinner with food poisoning. Leave him alone! Boys! Hey, look what we've got for dessert. Jell-O. - Yea! - It's not really Jell-O. It's cat brains with food coloring. She kills 'em at night... - and feeds 'em to us to save money. - Shut up, Miguel! Roger, you know we do not use those words in this house. Meow! And you know I would never use food coloring on my cat brains. - Okay, did we wash our faces? - Yeah? Brush our teeth? Been to the bathroom? Did you pick the lint from between your toes? Yeah? - Did you say your prayers? - Yeah. Oh, yeah? Night. - Night, Maggie. - Goodnight, Maggie. - I didn't say my prayers. - I didn't wash my face. - What's lint, again? - Shut up, butthead! Why do we gotta sleep in these sleeping bags? I haven't peed the bed in a long time. You peed the bed last week. She makes us sleep in sleeping bags 'cause she too old to bend over and tuck in sheets. - She isn't too old. She's got a lot to do. - Did you guys pray? I pray every night you go to bed without buggin' us with a thousand stupid questions. Maybe tomorrow you'll meet a nice family, Miguel. I'll pray for that. It could happen. God... If there is a god... If you're a man or a woman, if you're listenin', I'd really, really like... a family. My dad says that'll only happen if the Angels win the pennant. The baseball team, I mean. So, maybe you could help 'em win a little. Amen. Uh, and a woman too. Come in. You wanted to see me? - You feelin' any better today, George? - Why would I be feelin' better? Commissioner fined you $5,000 for jumpin' Gates. And word has it Ranch is pressin' civil charges for you poppin' him. Come to think of it, I have felt better since I slugged Wilder. - Your pistol's smokin', pal. - I hadn't made the connection. I know you and Wilder have been at each other's throats since you were players. Yeah, we've been at each other's throats since he spiked my knee and ruined my career. - Accidents happen, George. - It wasn't an accident. When you slide into a catcher with your nails up, it's on purpose. I was comin' into my best years. Now, don't go makin' more cow-pies to step in, George. You got enough manure on your boots now. Control yourself today. Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder that every Wednesday is Kid's Day. Whoa! I see better seats! Much better seats! Come on, J.P. Tickets are available the day of the game at the stadium box office. - All right! - Thank you. - Great seats. - Yeah. - This is much better than the tree. - I'll say. Hey, Skip. Trainer says I'm ready to pitch. When am I gettin' off the injured list? How's never sound? You're here 'cause you got a contract that pays you to be here. You blew your arm out. Played on too many pain pills. Pain pills? You were the one stuffin' 'em down my throat five years ago in Cincinnati. Hey, it was your decision to swallow 'em. I had a brain. When you were finished, I traded you. I never thought I'd get stuck with you again. Why, you rotten... That's not contagious, is it? Outta my way. I got a ball club to manage. ♪ And the rocket's red glare ♪ ♪ The bombs bursting in air ♪ ♪ Gave proof through the night ♪ ♪ That our flag was still there ♪ ♪ Oh, say does that Star-Spangled ♪ ♪ Banner yet wave ♪ ♪ O'er the land of the free ♪ ♪ And the home of the brave. ♪ Whoo-oo! I guess no matter how many times you hear that song played... in a major league stadium on a warm afternoon, it's still emotionally evocative. Drop dead. I got sunscreen in my eyes. Will I win, will I win, will I win, win, win? Aw! - Yeah! - Jose, can you see? - Wait a second. The first word is “Jose”? I thought it was... - It's Jose. We know. Wow! It's about a Spanish guy! ♪ Jose, can you see ♪ - I don't believe him. - It's so easy. Whit Bass takes the mound with his trademark slide. His oddball antics are by now well known to the fans. That's right, Ranch. This season alone we've seen him lick dirt, eat bugs and floss his catcher's teeth in the dugout. None of that, may I add, seems to have helped his pitching. He's two and eleven. Leading off for the Blue Jays, number 22, third baseman, Orin Farley. And after hardly any warm-up, Bass signals he's ready. Mm! Hmm, hmm! Huh? First pitch of the game and the Angels have an error and a man on base. So the fifth inning goes into the books with the score nothing to nothing. The Angels thus far have been able to keep the hard-hitting Blue Jays silent. But as we head into the sixth, the Jays have the middle of the order coming up... with the ever-dangerous Asher Lazzato leading off. Number 31, left fielder, Asher Lazzato. Bass sets... and sets... and sets again. Please, just throw the ball. Here's the pitch. And Lazzato smashes one to deep center! I don't think Williams will get to this one. Oh! And Ben Williams makes a miraculous catch. - Holy cow! - How'd he do that? Yeah, holy cow! How'd he do that? How did he do that? That, sports fans, is a play you're going to see run in baseball highlights for years to come. - Get me something here! Come on, come on! - We got it. Get me something! I'm hangin', I'm hangin'! This is dead airtime! - Did you see that? - Yeah, awesome. - They were just sucked down right from the sky. - Who? Those guys. Those guys in sparkling pajamas. What are you talking about, Roger? What guys in sparkling pajamas? You didn't see 'em? Those guys carrying Williams? - I don't know. - Hey, mister, did you see that? - Lucky catch. - No, did you see what happened with the clouds? Did you see the people with Williams when he caught the ball? Huh? There were shiny people out there. Flying, shiny people. Yeah, well, tell your parents about it. - But the... - Number 58, “The Irvinator”, Irving Nator. You didn't see 'em? It was a real good play, Roger. I saw that. Yes! Yes! Amazing play! I love it when they come from above like that. From-From above? The sky deal. It's a good entrance for 'em. - You mean you saw 'em? - The angels? - Angels? - 'Course I saw 'em. They're with me. The little one's a rookie. Just got off his training wings. You mean tho-those are... real... angels? Accept no substitutes. Who are you? Just call me Al. No one can see me or hear me but you. W-Why me? You asked for help and we're here. We come and go. It's an “as-needed" situation. Who you talkin' to, Rog? - What are you talkin' about? - Tubby's back. I'm vapor. Keep your nose clean and your heart open. You got angels around, sonny. We'll be in touch. Al! What... - Who's Al? - He's the... What's your problem? Are you sick or somethin'? Yeah, maybe. Get your pizza, hot pizza. With two outs, this is the Angels' last chance... to put away the Jays before extra innings. Next up is Messmer who, unfortunately, has been hitless... in his last 26 at bats. - Number 14, catcher Triscuit Messmer. - Time. Here we go again. And that one, ladies and gents, is headin' downtown... and Messmer breaks a bat and the Angels' losing streak... As he crashes a home run in the ninth to win the game. Oh yeah! We won? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! How did that happen? Yeah, ha! - But... you didn't see the angel with him? - We won. But there were angels in the outfield and in the infield. Yeah, nine of 'em. Ladies and gentlemen, our final drawing this afternoon... will give three lucky winners a chance to be photographed on the field.. - With manager George Knox. - That's a prize? Mm-mm. The first winning ticket is number 4-7-7-3-8-0. - I won. - What? You do it. I don't wanna have my picture taken. I don't like strangers. Geez. What's goin' on around here? The series against the Oakland A's... - - Opening Friday here at the Anaheim Stadium. - Who's he? I can see you kids don't know your baseball. That's Mel Clark. Mel Clark? Whoa, he pitched three shutouts in a row for Cincinnati in 1986. - Well, that's right. - My dad used to talk about him. You used to be Mel Clark? Yeah, I used to be. - Come on, son. Let's go. - That's it. That's all, folks. Okay, we have three photo ops. It'll be quick. Give 'em publicity stills. It'll be quicker. - They want a picture with you. They're all kids. - I hate kids. Yeah, I guessed that. First kid! J.P., wait! Well... He... Looks like a prison photo. Uh, would either of you mind smiling? The team did just win. It was a mistake. This team can't win. They won 'cause there were angels out there. Huh? Real ones. I saw 'em. Two angels came out of the sky and they picked up Ben Williams. And another angel hit Messmer's home run. That's why the bat broke. Great, a psycho kid. David, you think they'd screen these people. It's true! Ask Williams about it. Or Messmer. They'll tell you somethin's goin' on. You'll see. - Honey, why aren't you asleep? - I gotta ask you somethin'. Do you believe in angels? What do angels gotta do with you bein' out of your bed? No, I really wanna know. Do you think they're real? Well, there area lot of amazing things in life that just can't be explained. Uh... I believe in, uh... the possibility of miraculous things happening. That's what makes every day of our lives worth getting up for. So, umm... Yeah. I guess I do believe in angels. Yeah. Me too. Good night, Maggie. Night. Huh! Nice catch yesterday, Ben. How did it feel? Or did it all happen so fast you don't even remember? I felt weightless, like somebody had me by the arms, Skip. How'd I do that? It wasn't like a regular homer, you know? It felt like someone was swingin' with me. Very strange. I could feel some added power comin' from somewhere. It must've been those chili dogs I ate before the game. You know, that third one tasted kinda funny. Chili dogs. I'm looking for Roger Bowman. Does he live here? - Yeah. - I'm George Knox from the California Angels. Roger won a photograph at last Friday's game. - Oh. - Uh... I'd really like to give it to him myself. You're Roger's mom? Nope. Aunt? Grandma? No, no. We're not related. This is a short-term foster care facility. I run it. Roger is a ward of the state. Oh. Uh, so Roger... he's got a wild imagination? Always making up stories? No, actually. He's very grounded. The fact is, most kids who are taken from their parents by the court have a good handle on reality. I bet. Mel Clark strikes him out. Cincinnati wins. What do you want from him? Why are you really here? Uh, young fans. League needs more of 'em. Roger? - I got your pictures. - Thanks. - Yeah. - I didn't know you were bringing 'em. Hmm. - Looks like a prison photo. - Yeah. You said you thought you saw something at the game. Yeah, angels. Real ones. Why-Why do you think there would be... real angels... at the ball game? Maybe 'cause I prayed for 'em? Nothing you were doing was helping. I figured it couldn't hurt. Does he talk? Of course he talks. He just doesn't like strangers. Me either. I don't even like my friends. These angels you think you seen, do you suppose they're coming back? - If they feel like it, I guess. - Oh, this is crazy. I must be losing it. What I meant to say is... uh, uh, do you wanna come to the game tomorrow? I have an open seat next to the dugout and you can... get your Aunt Maggie or whoever she is to come along. - I don't go to baseball games. - Oh! - You can go, Roger. - Can J.P. Come too? Okay. After their victory over the Jays, the Angels open a three-game series against the visiting Athletics. Winning the last game may have given these Angels a boost. Sizing up the team, I'd say they look bouncier today, wouldn't you, Wally? - Absolutely, Ranch. As we saw in last game... - Keep it minimal, Wally. They'll like you better. We're 20 minutes from game time and there are already more people in the seats... then there were for the last five games combined. - Here. Here you go. Take that. Okay. - Thanks. - Do you want anything else? - Yeah, peanuts maybe, and nachos if you could. Yeah. - Sorry. - My linen suit! What do I do? Mustard stains. That's... hot water... Cold water... Club soda! That's club soda. - I got soda. - No! I'm all wet. Get up in front of me, now! We're gonna dry off. Leave your popcorn there. - Hey, what happened to you? - Those kids, they're evil. The big one might be lucky, so keep him happy. - J.P., let's go! - We gonna win today, kid? - Maybe. - Maybe? I don't know. It's your team. Don't remind me. Sit down! Oh, please, don't drink me. No, no, no, don't, don't! Shh. Shh-shh. This is between you and me, little guy. No one can see me but you. - Remember? - Oh... hi. Sit down, already. I left in a hurry yesterday. I forgot a few of the rules. Numero uno: Don't tell anyone about us. Now, I heard you already told a little kid and El Capitan. But nobody else. We hate recognition. We're a very sensitive group. If people know we're around, I wouldn't be able to get an angel within a mile of this team. - Okay. Are you guys gonna help out today? - We'll see. We never make commitments. We go and come and come and go. We're a capricious crowd. What's capri... What's capricious? Just keep your chin up and your eyes open and enjoy the game. You popped Al! - Who's Al? - Al's the boss angel. - He was just here, but he's gone now. - Next time will you tell me sooner? I'd like to try and see one. Mr. Knox, over here! Mr. Knox, over here! Mr. Knox, come on, come on! Mr. Knox! I just saw an angel! - You saw an angel? - Yeah. In my Coke cup. - In your... Coke cup? - Yeah. Okay... I gotta get back to the dugout. What should I do if I see another one? Kid, I was thinking of you as a sort of good luck charm. Not as someone who spiritually hallucinates. - What's that? - It means, if you see anything weird, keep it to yourself. But, wait! You should know. You're the manager and the angels are here to help. - And if I don't tell you, you're not gonna know... - Okay. Just calm down. In baseball, we got... signals. Make some kind of signal. Okay? I can't come over here every couple of seconds. Um... I'll go like that, okay? You do that. That's fine. - And we can't let David know. - Yeah, right. Absolutely. We can't tell David. Can't tell anyone. Thank you. - Here. - Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Oh, and excuse me, David, where are the nachos? I'm saving them for later. Sorry! Number 17, first baseman, Tom Brewer. Bass takes the sign. Here's the pitch. And it's lined to left for another base hit. So it's more bad news for manager Knox... as he does his dance in the dugout. Mapel waits for the pitch. - Strike! - Strike? Aw, come on! Now that's no strike! If that was a strike, then you blind as a horse's ass! Come on. Let me have some... gimme this. Mr. Knox. - Yeah? - It's nacho butt. Go buy the kids nachos. Anything... but nachos. - Buy them Angel's jackets. - It's 90 degrees outside. Get your butt up there now! You know, it's been four innings and no real angels yet. I was just thinking, maybe you shouldn't swear so much. I bet the angels don't like it. Shhhoot. You stupid sons of... a kid! Man, he is a deadbeat. Let's keep the profanity down! - Huh? - I mean it, no swearin'! That eliminates all speech for most of the team. So here in the ninth, the Athletics have opted to bring in reliever... Tom Ruddy to pitch to Angels heavy hitter, Ray Mitchell. - Oh-ho, wow! - What happened? There's an angel right next to Hemmerling. Uh, David, I-I need a drink. - You have drinks. - I don't want these. I want somethin' else. What else? Uh... coffee. You drink coffee? Yeah. Of course. All the time. All the time. What do you think we are, little kids? Now, get me a cup or I'll scream. How do you take it? In cups. Mr. Knox! Mr. Knox! Come over here. We got one! Hey. What's goin' on? - There's an angel with Hemmerling. - What? There's an angel massaging Hemmerling's shoulders. This is ridiculous. I don't know what you see, but there's no one with Hemmerling. She's rubbing his shoulders. - Huh? - And what should I do about it? Put him in. Pinch-hit. I got Mitchell coming up. He's my best hitter. Hemmerling can't hit the broadside of a barn. I can't substitute my worst hitter for my best hitter. - If you want a hit, you'll put in Hemmerling. - It's crazy! Wacko. You forget about it. - But he's got an angel. - Ah! What's the worst thing that could happen? Are we gonna fall out of last place? Sit down, Mitchell! You're up, Hemmerling. Huh? - What are you talkin' about? - Yeah? You heard what I said. You're out and you're in. You gotta be stupid! Hey, get your stuff! As Mitchell was getting ready to lead off, Knox has suddenly decided to pinch hit. And he's bringing in Danny Hemmerling, the utility infielder, who is known, sports fans, for his glove, but definitely, not for his bat. Hemmerling for Mitchell? Go back to Cincinnati! Strike! Where'd they go? - Strike! - See the pitch? What the... ♪ For goodness sake ♪ ♪ I got the hippy-hippy shakes ♪ ♪ Yeah, I got the shakes ♪ ♪ I got the hippy-hippy shakes ♪ - ♪ Ah, I can't stand still! ♪ - Go, go, come on! - ♪ With the hippy-hippy shakes. ♪ - Hey, uh... ♪ Yeah, the way I feel now ♪ ♪ Well the hippy-hippy shakes ♪ ♪ Yeah, real bad ♪ ♪ Oooh the hippy-hippy shakes ♪ ♪ Well, now you shake it to the left ♪ - Go, go, go! - ♪ You shake it to the right ♪ - Throw it! - Safe! - Yeah! - Yeah!

I've never seen anything like this. And obviously, neither have these umps. I don't know. Yeah! All right! Something's going on with this kid. Ladies and gentlemen, can we now say the Angels are on a winning streak? Or were these last few games just a small blip on the screen of a terminally ill patient? Only time will tell. What is going on? Where are my stats? I'm on the air! My ass is hanging on the air, and there are no stats. How many errors? - There were a lot of errors. - Not as many as in this booth. Let me tell you, this is not baseball. - Ow! - David. Whatever your duties before, forget 'em. From now on, these boys will be at all our games. - All right! - That's your job. I want to remind you, you are gonna fire me on Friday, aren't you? - You've bonded with the boys. - Bonded? - You're gonna stick around, David. - Yeah, stick around. - You got job security. - Job security? Who knew? So, you're right. Hemmerling came through. - Yeah, 'cause the angel. - Ah, whatever. - We got angels helping the team. - Ah, well, that may be, but we're winning. Yeah. All the games, man! Can you believe it? When we're on the road, you should watch the games on TV. We'll figure out a way for us to talk on the phone. You mean, the phone in the dugout you're always yellin' into... - and banging against the wall and spitting at? - Yeah. Yeah. Cool! What a game. First time Hemmerling got a hit, let alone a home run. - It's 'cause of the angels; They helped him. - Get in. Come on. We don't have all day. - J.P. doesn't ride in cars. - What's the problem? He gets carsick? Sort of. He used to live in a car with his mom. He slept in the front curled up like a cat. When he gets in, his stomachache comes back. - I'll call you tomorrow. - All right. Thank you for the ride home. He speaks? - Hi. You guys have a good time? - Hi. - A blast! - We won! - Great. - Where's Miguel? - I bought him all sorts of stuff. - Miguel got placed in a foster home this afternoon. - He got placed? - Miguel's gone? Mm-hmm. Where? With who? A real nice family from Northridge. I'm gonna miss him. I really liked Miguel. I only have a license for short-term care. - You know, Miguel's been here for six months. - Seven. Seven months! Right. That's what happens, you know? I mean... you understand that, Roger? Oh, don't feel bad, Maggie. I bet we'll see him again. Maybe in court or something. Oh, Roger. God forbid. Roger? - What? - Are you asleep? If I was asleep, how would I be talkin' to you? "You could be “sleep-talking." Look, I'll give a dime tomorrow if you don't say another word. Okay. Roger? You can forget that dime. Do you think your parents are gonna ever come get you? I don't know. Mom's not alive, but... my dad's gonna come get me. I'm sure of it. You think my mom's gonna ever come get me? Maybe, you know. It could happen. Yeah... it could happen. - Roger? - What? I'm happy you see the angels. Me too. Good night. It's a beautiful day here in Anaheim... as the resurgent Angels prepare to meet their longtime nemesis, the Detroit Tigers... who have won the first five games of their western road trip. They've been the hottest team in the league for the last few weeks, Ranch. Coming up next week, "Cap Night." This will feature a totally white cap with red pinstripes and the Angels' logo. It's free for the first 50,000 fans entering Anaheim Stadium. - I see an angel. - Already? I gotta go bathroom. I can't go alone. Bad guys might get me. You just came back from the bathroom. - I've gotta go now. Sorry. - Gimme your Coke. Gimme the Crackerjacks. Stand up. Go. - What's up? - We got an angel. But the game hasn't started. She was with Mel Clark. Ah, impossible. She was there. That means Mel should start the game today. - Mel's arm is gone. - I don't care. He should start the game. No way! Besides, he's not even on the active roster. If the angel pitches with him, he'll be awesome. You really do see something, don't you? Yeah... I do. Good. All right. You're off injured reserve and you're starting today. You talkin' to me? Yeah. So get your stuff together. The starting pitcher announced for this game was Dan Prince. But just moments ago, the Angels made a dramatic change... and activated the long-injured Mel Clark. League rules specify that up until the first pitch is thrown, the roster can be altered, although I can't ever remember this happening so near game time. Me either, Ranch. Easy, Wally. Less is more. These warm-ups should be interesting. Over the plate, man! Clark looks a little rusty. Too much time in the whirlpool, Wally. I'm checking to see... if Dan Prince pulled a muscle during his warm-up. There must be some logical explanation as to why Knox would make such a bizarre change. I have personally checked the stats, sports fans, and Mel Clark hasn't started a game... in this decade. He looks mighty nervous out there. Not as nervous as George Knox Clark takes the sign. - Talk about heat! Messmer felt that one. - Ow! Wow! - What an amazing pitch! - You damn... darn right. Well, commit that to memory, Wally, 'cause he doesn't have any more of those in him. - An angel helped out on that one. - Good. Strike! Strike! Mel! - Way to go! - All right, Mel! It's now the top of the ninth. There are two outs. We've got a full count. This could be the Tigers' last chance to get back in this game. One more. I told you! I told you! That's the game! The Angels win one-nothing in a miracle shutout... pitched by the veteran, Mel Clark. How in the world did old noodle-arm pull that off? And who gets the credit? George Knox. George Knox. We're down in the Angels' clubhouse for a talk with manager George Knox. What inspired you to start Mel? A feeling. An instinct. A kind of faith. A faith in what? Has Mel shown this kind of power in practice? Mel Clark has always shown himself to be an extraordinary athlete. The rest is about believing in something or someone. Now, when did you suddenly start believing in Clark? He's been sitting on the bench all season. - I look for signs. - It's good to win. Sometimes they come from unexpected places. - Look, that's enough out of me for today. - Uh-huh. Talk to the star of the game. Excuse me. Something's going on. Mel? You talk to us about the game? Well, it... it feels great to be a winner again. - We won! - Yeah. Three in a row. Oh, I feel good! - Yeah, me too! - Me three! I owe you guys. Okay, anything you want. You name it. You got it. All right. Let's play ball! Yeah! - Come on, let's go. - Come on, let's go. Slow and easy. Keep your elbows up. Here it comes. Swing hard! Great hit, J.P.! Get it, Roger, get it! Get it! - Yeah! All right! - Roger, come on. - You missed on purpose. - All right, J.P.! All right, who's next? Let's give the kid over on the car a shot. - What's your name? - Marvin Vincent Archer. - You play any ball before, Marvin? - No, never played any ball. Well, this is the perfect time to learn. Come on. - Watch the ball and when I say, "now", you swing. - Stay sharp, Zack. Just do exactly what I say. Get ready to swing. - Now! Oh! Oh! - Go, Marvin! Run to first base! Go, Marvin, go! Yeah! Yeah! That's it! - You stay on base and do just what I say. - Okay. - We got runners on first and second. - Places now. And look who's coming to bat... Babe Ruth. Get ready. Oh! - Go, Marvin, go! - Go, Marvin! Run home! - Run home? Run home. Run home. - Run home! - Run home. Run home. - Hey, Marvin, where you going? Run home, run home, run home. Hey, where's he goin'? And what happened? You told him to run home. He did. That's cool. You call that a call? You call that a call? In all my years of baseball, I have never seen such a... Such an astute evaluation... of a potentially difficult decision. Masterful call. Oh, have a nice day. Fair ball! Ow! - Safe! - Yeah! Yahoo! - Yeah! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! - Yes! - There you go, pal. - Thanks! All right. - Oh, thanks, Mel. - Hey, that's my ball. - Oh, it's... Unbelievable! Get out of the way! - You're outta here! - Yeah! No? - Hey! - ♪ Buy me some peanuts and Crackerjacks ♪ ♪ I don't care if I never get back ♪ ♪ For it's root, root, root for the home team ♪ ♪ If they don't win it's a shame ♪ ♪ For it's one, two ♪ ♪ Three strikes you're out at the old ball game. ♪ Go! The Angels have closed out the season... with an incredible hot streak. Who would have believed this team could go from last place at the all-star break... to just one win away from clinching the division title? Now it all comes down to the last two games of the season. And, ironically, they are with the defending champion, Chicago White Sox... who are one game back and closing fast in a determined effort... to deny the Angels the championship. The first of those crucial games takes place right here... this afternoon. What's it say? - Thanks. 'Bye. - Says the van's gonna pick us up at 12:00. Roger? Stupid thing. - Roger? That was your social worker. - Huh? - What did she want? - Your hearing's been changed to this afternoon. - But I got a game this afternoon. - I know. I've just tried everything to get them to reschedule. It's just not possible. Maggie, I'm not going. You don't have a choice, sweetheart. - Well, what about George? What about the angels... - I'll call Mr. Knox. I know he thinks you guys are his lucky charms... but this is just something you have to do. J.P. can go to the game... and we'll just try real hard to get you there before it's over. That's all I can do. Oh, man! What about the game? Attention youngsters, aged six to 16. Be sure to join the junior Angel fan club. For just $5.00, you'll receive game tickets, baseball cards, a free autographed... The southern California sun is shining; The field is ready, the hot dogs are warm... and there's not an empty seat in the house. Get your hot dogs! I know. I know. Don't even say it. A large Coke, two dogs, three Crackerjacks. And I was thinking of getting him a car. And maybe a corporate jet... - Still no Roger. - He'll be here any second. Of all the days to haul the kid off to court. Why didn't Maggie say he was sick or something? That'd be lying. Maggie would never lie. Well, Maggie's not in a pennant race. Number 19, third baseman, Bruce Shea. - Hey, you don't see anything, do you? - Maybe. Hmm? Sorry. Oh, it's not your fault. You never seen angels before. - Why should you now? - Hey, it could happen. You understand that once this hearing... has established Roger's permanent placement status... his welfare will forever forward be determined by this court? - I understand. - And you've consulted a lawyer? Look, lady, I get what I'm doing. The kid's not mine anymore. I'm not proud of it. It's not something I can change my mind about either. We're ready to see you now, Roger. Dad? Dad, I didn't know you were going to be here. You know, the Angels are only one game from the pennant? Can you believe it? It's just like you said - Sorry, boy. - Dad? Hey, Dad, wh... Did you hear what I said? Where are you going? Daddy? - Don't cry. - Come back. - We lost. - Don't cry. It-it's only a game. Come on, you're getting snot all over the place. - It's nobody's fault. - I tried to see angels. I-I really tried. I guess, without angels helping, this team doesn't have what it takes. Or maybe I just don't have what it takes. We could still win without the angels. It could happen. Maybe. Uh, give me a minute, kid, and I'll be out to take you home. Don't cry. No, we're not. Hey, put out that cigarette. Hey. I'm Ranch Wilder, the voice of the Angels. I know who you are. I heard you on the radio. You sure do have a big chin. Everybody's a critic. So what's your name? - J.P. - Well, J.P., that was a tough loss today, huh? Knox took it pretty hard. He was getting kind of crazy out there. - 'Cause Roger couldn't come. - I get it. So Roger's sort of lucky. Is that it? He sees the angels, the ones who help out. He prayed for 'em. - Real angels? - Yeah, but, I don't see 'em. And Knox, he sees them? No. Roger has to tell him when they're around. Really? You know, by releasing you legally, it does make it possible for somebody to take you permanently. He did that 'cause he wants the best for you. Yeah. Giving someone away is a great way to show 'em you care. Hey, Roger. Took a little longer than you expected. We waited three hours for his hearing. That's quick for family court. - What'd they decide? - Oh, it's just a formality. He belongs to the State of California now. Scoot over. Roger, I'm sorry about today. Why? Because you lost your stupid baseball game? No, because you're hurt. You don't know anything about it. You know, Roger, when I was growing up, I never saw very much of my dad. He couldn't take care of himself… so taking care of me and my brothers... was out of the question. I'm not sure the pain that caused ever goes away. But I am sure you can't go through life... thinking everyone you meet will one day let you down. Because, if you do, a very bad thing will happen. You'll end up like me. I'm going inside. I thought you said you had to be somewhere. I do. Right here. - Yuck! - You both wash your hands? - Yeah. - Okay then, let's dig in. Next time I'll try lasagna. You guys like lasagna? - No. What is it? - No. What is it? Look! It's God's thumbnail. That's just the moon, J.P. No God up there. I can't believe you said that. The kid who sees angels? I don't believe in angels anymore. - Roger, what are you talking about? - That's okay, J.P... Roger's had a tough day. "The source says there's a boy known as Roger... "who even watches games on TV when the team is out of town... "and reports to manager Knox over the phone." What's a source? - The person who told. - Oh. "And when Mel Clark made his amazing comeback in August, "it was Roger's, it was Roger's idea to start him." - That's me. - Who do you think told? I don't know. - Maybe David found out. I don't see how. - Are we in trouble? Knox is in trouble, that's for sure. This is bad. Right? We're gonna have to tell Maggie. Right this way, Mr. Knox. You stood me up last night. What in the Sam Hill is all this about real angels? - It's nothing. - Start talkin'! Okay, I-I got these two kids... and I think of them as mascots. And... the angels, uh, well... it's just something that's going on between me and them. You're telling me, there's real angels in the ballpark? Sometimes, but they're not in on all the plays. You've lost it, partner. Look, if I lied to you, then the angels wouldn't like it and they might not come back. They're very... temperamental. "Mental" is the key word here. I'm sorry, George, but I'm relieving you... of your management responsibilities. You can't do that. We're only one game a way I'll tell you what. I'll give you 24 hours to get your head on straight. Then I'll call a press conference... and you can publicly renounce this hogwash. George, you repeat any of the baloney I've heard here, we're talking the end of your career in baseball. - Have I made myself clear? - Yes. What's going on, Knox? What's going on? Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We're gonna make this short and sweet. My manager, George Knox here, has something he'd like to say to you. George? I have a statement I'd like to read. "There have been reports that I've been using angels... to help the team win." Go on. Go in. I was gonna read a statement... but, instead, I'm gonna shoot from the hip. You know, there are a lot of times in sports... when there's no logical explanation why things happen. Sometimes a player gets hot... and goes beyond their physical ability. Is it just adrenaline? I don't know. But, I do believe there are times in life... where something stronger, higher, or maybe spiritual is with us. I can't explain it, but something has happened.. to my players this year. Something that's changed the way they play... and the way I manage. You can call it faith. You can call it angels. You can call it whatever you want. That's all I have to say. George, does this mean you really think... that a kid sees angels at your games? Excuse me. I'd, uh, I'd like to say something... on behalf of George Knox. Uh, what's your name? What's your business here? My name is Maggie Nelson. I take care of foster kids. One of these boys is, uh, the child who can see angels. He could stand up right now and tell you exactly what's happened... And I know you'd just laugh at him. But, when a professional football player... drops to one knee to thank God after making a touchdown, nobody laughs at that. Or when a pitcher crosses himself before going to the mound, nobody laughs at that. Seems like you're saying it's okay to believe in God, but it's not okay to believe in angels. Now, I thought they were on the same team. Is it your belief, ma'am, that, uh, angels play baseball? Since the all-star break, yes! We all need somebody to watch out for us. Every kid I have ever taken care of... Has been looking for someone to love: An angel. You've got to have faith. You've got to believe. You've got to look inside yourself. The footprints of an angel are love. And where there is love, miraculous things can happen. I've seen it. I'd also like to say something. I don't know if there are angels out there... other than the 25 of us in uniform. But I know there is one thing I won't do. I won't play for anyone but George Knox. I believe in him. That goes for me too. Thank you. All of you. Print what you want. George Knox is the manager of the ball club. And, if there are any angels out there, I sure hope they're on our side. - Oh, yeah! - Yeah! Yes! Good evening, everyone, and welcome to downtown Anaheim... where there are no seats left in sports heaven... as a sellout crowd fills the ballpark for the final game of the season. Tonight, George Knox will send his Angels, real or imagined, out against a tough White Sox team... to determine who will be the Western Division champion. When I came here this season, I didn't believe in you guys. I didn't believe in anything. But, when you stood up this morning, you gave me back my reason to believe. I'm more proud of being a part of this team than any team I've been on. You're all winners and I believe in you! So let's go out there and show them what winners can do! - Let's take that championship! - Yeah! Yeah! All right! You look fantastic! Okay, you heard him. Let's go! Ladies and gentlemen, your California Angels! Starting pitcher for the Angels in this crucial game... is the veteran Mel Clark. - Yeah! - All right! He's been their big-game guy since he returned to the lineup in July. So Clarks had a rocky start here in the first. He's got runners on second and third with two outs and Darren at bat. Darren drives the ball to left. It's fair! One run will score and here comes Cooper! Norton gets to it. It's gonna be close. Here comes the ball! Cooper slides. He's safe! The fans don't like the call, but the Sox go up 2-0 and we 're still in the top of the first. You got 'im now! Go, go, yeah! Clark pitches to Young. He loops one over second base and here comes Garcia! Whoa! Garcia makes a spectacular save to end the inning. With the Angels behind 2-0, Clark's really struggling. And with one out in the top of the fifth... and a man on first and second, Beasley comes to bat. Anybody got any, uh... you know? No question he's tiring, Wally, and Knox knows it. Ball one. You had to expect this. They're getting Tiller up now in the bullpen. - Oh, Mitchell makes a great play... - Yeah! - And gets the force at third. - All right! All right! - All right! All right! - Go, baby, come on! Here in the sixth, Garcia's on first with a single as the Angels... try to battle their way back into the ball game. That brings up Ray Mitchell. Ray's been hot as wildfire the second half of this miraculous season... But, as many of you know, in the past Mitchell has choked when it came to pressure situations. You got this one, Ray! You hear me? You can do it! Mitchell connects! - It's hit deep! - Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! And it's gone! - Ray Mitchell has just hit... - All right! Yeah! A monster home run with a man on to tie the game here in the sixth. Hey! Whoo! All right! Don't you stop! Clark has his back to the wall here in the seventh... as the Sox are threatening again with two men on base. Okay, we're holding our own. Holding our own. Holding our own. Go! Hang in there! Clark definitely could use an angel now... as he's tiring late in the game. Yeah! Yeah. There seems to be some sort of magic... In the way his team is supporting him, Ranch. - Hey, kid. How you doin'? - Fine. Al! - Hey, kiddo, sharp outfit. I wish I had one. - Thanks. Gee, I am glad to see you. You know, I was afraid you guys... wouldn't show up today since, you know, a lot of people know about the angels now. No one's coming. Championships have to be won on their own. It's a rule. Oh. Well, then, what are you doing here? I came here to check on Mel. He's comin' up soon. - He's gonna be one of us. - Y-You mean he's... Ah, he smoked for years. It's always a mistake. He's got six months left. Doesn't know anything's wrong yet. - No. - Don't you worry. He's well taken care of. You concentrate on your own life now. We expect great things from you, kid. We'll all be watching. You remember that. Even though you can't see us, we're always watching. Come on, Angels! Angels! With a man on and one out in the eighth, Clark is showing definite signs of fatigue... - as he pitches to March. - Come on, March. Put it here, man. Ball three. - Take your time, Clark. - Get ready to go, guys! Easy, Mel. Here's the pitch. And March grounds to Martinez. They get Darren at second. Garcia throws. Double play! - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! And once again, solid defense bails Clark out of a jam! How'd you like that, Coach? Oh, way to go! Way to go! Hey! It's still tied up here in the bottom of the eighth, but the Angels have Garcia at bat and Martinez on third with the go-ahead run. Martinez goes on the pitch. Garcia bunts! And it's a squeeze play! Here's the throw Martinez scores! And the Angels take the lead! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! All right! Messmer pops out to Gaboyan to end the inning. So as we enter the ninth, the Angels are only three outs away from the pennant... if they can just hold on to this 3-2 lead. - Hey, Mel. - Hey, Mel, you're my dad's favorite player! - Let's finish this. - We got 'em. All right. All right. Three outs, boys. - Let's do it! - So with the championship on the line, manager George Knox elects to send a tired Mel Clark... out to face the heart of the White Sox lineup. - He's all alone. - Let's go. Come on, Angels. Don't worry. He'll get an angel. Mel always gets an angel. Clark takes the sign for his first pitch to Gasper. Let's see if he has anything left. Gasper gets a piece of it! And it falls in for a single! The tying run is now on first. All right. We need Sanford. Get him ready. They're getting Sanford up in the bullpen. He bunts! Clark fields it cleanly and gets the runner at first, - but Gasper advances to second on the sacrifice. - All right! One down! White Sox now have the tying run in scoring position with Darren at bat. It's in the hole! Garcia dives! He gets it! The throw is off-balance. Not in time! - Safe! He's safe. - Are you sure? Gasper is held on second, but the go-ahead run is now on first with only one away. Hey, Knox, wake up! Clark looks very tired. Gaboyan swings and smashes it deep to left center! This is trouble! Williams got a good jump on the ball! - Somebody better take charge! - I got it! And Ben Williams saves the game for now... - with a spectacular catch! - And a great throw to hold the runner at third. Try it! Oh! And he hits Birch in the back on the first pitch. That loads the bases. And Kesey, the league R.B.I. leader, is up next. Number 32, Kit "Hit or Die" Kesey I can't believe he's leaving Clark in the game. Any hit scores a run. - There's an angel there now, right? - No. The runners take their leads. And Kesey got a good piece of that one, but it's foul. We've got one strike. Sanford is ready in the bullpen. - Ball one! - His arm has to be tired. He's thrown 156 pitches. - Ball two! - There's one coming, right, Roger? I don't know, J.P... I... I don't think so. And Clark just misses nicking Kesey and the count goes to 3 and 1. He's way behind the batter now. - Any angels? - No. And Kesey jumps on it! This could be the game! It's deep! It's down the line! If it stays fair, it's outta here! - It's gonna be close. - Foul, foul, foul! But it's foul. It comes down to a full count. Two outs, the top of the ninth. The Angels lead by one run, and for Mel Clark, this is the pressure cooker! - I gotta take him out. - No. Please, just let him try. He's all used up. He can't do it by himself. Yes, he can. All he has to do is believe. And Knox will pull Mel Clark. All I can say is, it's about time. I got nothing left. Yeah, you do. You got one strike left. You got an angel with you right now. Just got here and he's gonna help. - Kid sees an angel? - Yeah, he must. That's the signal. Could happen. Okay. Go get him for the championship. All right! - Come on! - Come on, Mel! - Come on, Mel! - He still has it! Ladies and gentlemen, I don't believe it, Knox will let Clark stay in to pitch to Kesey. This is not smart baseball This is ridiculous... Let's go, my brother. Come on. He's got it and it's over! He's got it! - I can't believe it! - The Angels win the pennant! We won! - All right, J.P.! We won, we won! - Yea! Yeah! - There are angels! - Not this time, Mel. You did it yourself. - We won! We won! - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! - We won! - All right! - Yeah! - Whoo! - Yeah! I can't believe it! Ranch. - You're fired. - You can't fire me! I got a contract! I'm Ranch Wilder! Easy, Ranch. Less is more. And the Angels have won it! - Maggie! Maggie! We won! - Maggie! - We won! - We won! - I know. I heard. Oh, congratulations. - The Angels won the pennant! It's great! Well done! - Oh, Roger, your social worker called. - She did? - What they want? - Was it about my father? No, but it is about finding you a permanent home. Oh, J.P., come back. J.P., come back! You know, nothing's probably ever as good as your real parents. But there's some people who could care for you... and love you and take care of you. Yeah. I guess so. Yeah. Roger, the person who called social service, that was me. I want to try and be your dad. I want you to come and live at my house. You want... you want... You okay, honey? No way. I-I can't. You know, I can't leave J.P. I can never leave J.P. He's coming too. - He is? - I heard that. Yeah! - Wait, what about Maggie? - No. My work is here. Don't worry. There are plenty of little angels looking for a home. - So... so we're gonna be a family. - Yep. I'm gonna have a daddy. I knew it could happen. We're always watching.
