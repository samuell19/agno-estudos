The Treeline Lodge Resort is nestled in the Adirondack Mountains. It is one of a few family-owned ski resorts still running. Legend has it Great-Grandpa was bathing in a river, much to the relief of his family, when he found a rare gold nugget, which he used to buy up the land and the mountain. He built the first part of the lodge himself from timber. In truth, Grandma did most of the work. He opened the ski lodge in 1936. Why? He missed skiing and sledding. He was Norwegian. I know all of this, because my family owns the lodge. It's been passed down generation to generation, each year getting a little older. Anyone who ever stays at the Treeline Resort will tell you it's always been special. All kinds of people meet here. It's where my mom and dad met. It's where they got married. I was actually born here. Now I work as the events coordinator with my dad. I help him manage the lodge. Welcome to the Treeline. Do you have a reservation? How may I help you? And some people, like me, have other reservations. Reservations about love. I checked out of that room a long time ago and somehow lost the key. ♪ ♪ Hello. Whoo-hoo! We made it! Winners have arrived. Oh, Tay-Tay, look at those slopes. Yeah, I'll be looking at them from the lodge, because as you know, I don't ski. Yeah, so you relax, I'll ski, we'll both have a great time. Hey! You're standing in the middle of the road. If we're going to get run over, let the snowboarders do it. Enjoy your stay. We're all booked up, sir. I'm sorry. I'm not sorry at all. We are sold out. Yeah! And my new Room Reserve software is doing great. Told you it was worth it. I'm so excited that Duffy Johnson is coming back. I remember his silver run at Calgary. You know where he learned to ski? Here. Right here on our mountain. The prodigal son returning. I can't wait till he gets here. Oh, well he got here yesterday. He's probably out on the mountain right now. I mean, skiing is my life, right? Going down the mountain, that is the life rushing at you. Boom, boom, boom. You can't be afraid of the twists and turns and the gnarly moguls. You just got to power through. Right? You got to enjoy the ride. You got to enjoy the ride. Well, it's been great talking to you. I've always been a good listener. See you on the slopes. Are you going to make the trees tonight? Oh. I'll check us in. - Okay. - Hello. Welcome. - Hi. How can I help you? - I'm Kay Griffin, checking in. - Okay. Okay, Kay? - Yes. Welcome to the Treeline. I'm Tom, the hotel manager. Oh, hi. I'm Tay. Nice to meet you. This tree is beautiful. Is it a balsam fir? It is, in fact, a balsam. Scientific name: Abies balsamea. It's one of my favorite conifers. Curious fact: most conifers are evergreens, but not... Not all evergreens are conifers. Conifers. Exactly. I won the package on Winner Winner. Oh, I love that game show... oh, you were the one that jumped in the ball pit with the kids. That was amazing. - Yeah. I don't mean to babble. If there is anything you need while you're here, let me know. Maybe a little hot water. Oh, we have it in every room. Replaced the water heater last summer. It set us back a little, but that's to be expected. I meant for tea. Of course. It's over there. I'll show you. - Oh, thanks. These are our signature teas. We have sugar cookie sleigh ride, snow day, a sugar plum spice, candy cane lane, and cranberry vanilla wonderland. Hmm. I think I'm babbling again. - Oh, no, I don't mind. You have a very nice voice. Oh, well... Hey, let's move that bottom. I got to hit the slopes. I'm sorry. It was so nice to meet you. Likewise. Hey, looks like you met somebody. We were just talking. Yeah, well, that's how it starts, sis. Dadi, it's beautiful. - Preena, it's freezing. - I'm fine. Looks just like the picture. This is not a college. They have a ski school here. Preena, you told me we were visiting another college. No college is open, Dadi. We are going to experience a nice American Christmas. We should have gone back to India. It'll be fun. Do you really want to fly back 17 hours to India, then fly back a week later? Pass me the heavy ones, son. Oh, I got the bags. Mom, why don't you and Dad head inside and check in. Thank you, Leo. Okay. Stay here. I'll get someone to help with the luggage. Can you help with the luggage? Me? Do you go to Dartmouth? Yeah, I'm a freshman. That's at the top of my list. I'm here because I'm touring colleges with my grandmother. I'd love to talk with you about it. You want to talk to me? Okay. Dadi, this boy goes to Dartmouth. It's one of the colleges on my list. - Load the bags. - Yes, ma'am. Oh, hi. Welcome to the Treeline. How can I help you? Well, you can help me by telling my granddaughter to stay home and not come to America for her education. Okay. Maybe we can talk later about Dartmouth. Give me the inside scoop. Uh... - Let's meet at Trivia. - Trivia? Christmas Trivia. It's an online brochure. Don't you know about your own activities? Oh, that Trivia. Sure. Unless you have to work. Work? Yes, work. More hip, less lip. - I want a Lab. - A poodle. Hey, Dad? Yes, Miles. Since our birthdays are coming up, we thought we could have more responsibilities with a dog. Aviana, the problem is, I'm going to be turning the big 4-0, and I don't want to be chasing a dog all over the place, so we are not getting a dog. Okay. I will think about it. Are you done thinking about it? No, not yet. - Well, hurry up. - Hey. Come on, Dad. Think faster. I'm trying, I'm trying. Here comes the valet. Hold on. What about the dog? Hold on a second. I'm thinking about something else. Hey, how much snow do you get here a year? Uh, I don't know. Sure do get a lot of sunlight. What's the average temperature? Cold. Nice. Fill it up. Electric. For you. Come on, kids. Thank you. Bye-bye. Hey, Dad, did you remember to confirm the Santa Claus to ski down the mountain on Christmas Eve? How could I forget a thing like that? Oh, no. No. Room Reserve is crashing. Don't worry... The screen is frozen. I have a backup. Unlimited hard drive, infinite memory. No password required. Okay, well, you continue to check the guests in old-school, I'm going to go to the office and see if I can reboot it. Okay. Hello, and welcome... Paper. Do you have any paper? Do you mind? Well, be my guest, which you are. - Does that look right to you? - I'm not sure what that is. It's thermoelectric. Snow power's go power. I'm into renewable energy. Kevin Portillo checking in. Portillo. You have my register book. Sorry. Yes, well, you're Room 345. Baggage? Just my kids, which...? - Come on. Give it to me. - Let me see. - Oh, great. Thank you. - Room 345. And you have my... Kids. Hey. You wrote on the back of next December. ♪ ♪ Daddy, are you okay? I'm okay. I think. Here. We'll just put... You don't need to help him. That is his job. So I'll see you later? Yeah, sure. Thank you. What? It's not enough? Leo, your father wants to go skiing. Right there, Mom. You don't work here? Uh, no, I just wanted to help. Out! Why are you smiling? He's cute. And he goes to Dartmouth. We're going to meet him at trivia. Oh, this was a mistake. Come on, wake up. Come on. Holly, you okay? I'm okay, I think. Who just checked in? I'll have to check my database. Kevin Portillo is here. Who's Kevin Portillo? Daddy, look at all the Christmas things we get to do. Yeah. That's great. Holly? Hey. I got one for you too. Here. Thank you. Okay, I'm going to put it on. It looks great on you. Thank you. We're going to have so much fun. Are you sure you don't want to hit the slopes? You can take a lesson. Nah. I'm good. I think I'm just going to take a shower and go sit down by the fireplace and read. Enjoy your skiing. Oh, I will. Hi. This is Tay Griffin for Dr. Fulichen. Oh. Oh, she's not in. Okay. All right, yeah, I'll call back later. Thanks. Seven days of Christmas. This is so exciting. They do everything here. Dadi, look, there's a snowman contest, Build a gingerbread house. Wreath-making. Santa skis down the mountain on Christmas Eve. I know you didn't want to come here, but look how much fun it's going to be. What is this? That's my bathing suit. Did you leave the rest of it in India? We're not in India. We shouldn't even be here. I told your father I had reservations about bringing you here. I'm going to college here. That is what I want. Let's embrace American traditions. Sledding? Oh, this was a mistake. You two are very quiet. We didn't want to disturb you when you were thinking. You know, about the... Oh, yes, yes, yes. Right. Hmm, I have given that some thought. So you both know how to speak Spanish with your abuela. Mm-hmm. You both know how to speak English, obviously. So I think that it's important that you both know how to speak dog before we can get a dog. For example, what does this mean? You're hungry. You want to play ball. No. Sorry. That meant I needed to go for a walk. But you two keep working on those language skills, okay? Hold on. I heard that. You're angry. See? We can speak dog. ♪ ♪ Have a great day, guys. Hey! I saw you shredding on Eagle's Nest. You really look like you own that run. Duffy Johnson. I recognize you. Wow. How are you, silver boy? That's right. That's right, silver, '88, Calgary. I'm not saying I set the world record or anything, but... Yeah, 'cause then you would have won the gold. Besides, I was just talking about your beard. Oh. Single? Not by choice. After my husband passed, I just couldn't find a guy who could keep up with me. I was talking about the ski lift line, but that's good to know. Single? Here! Hey, what's your name? See you on the slopes! That's a funny name. Hey, Dad. I got here early and started setting up. I'll do the trivia and you do the s'mores, Dad. You still burn the marshmallows? Hello, Holly. Hello, Kevin. How are you? I'm good. You? Doing okay. I never thought I'd see you again. Neither did I. I mean, last I heard you were working at the Marriott on Marco Island. I had no idea you were working here. Well, I came up here to help my dad run the place when my mom died. It's been eight years. Never left. So sorry. I didn't know. Yeah, well, we haven't really spoken much since college. I tried to find you online. You have zero social media footprint. Yeah, well, the Wi-Fi here is really bad I've got to finish setting up, so... Well, here, let me help you. No, no, no. I can't let you do that. You're a guest, you know? You know, what if I accidentally drop a table on your head? Hmm. Now that's the Holly I remember. I think I'll take my chances with her. Come on. Did you hear that? Something's over there. Aah!

Seen anyone from school? Not really. You? Went to a few reunions. Oh, I went to the tenth. I missed that one. That was when my wife died. Oh, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. It was six months after our son was born. The only mother they know is me. I don't make them clean their rooms. They have no set bedtimes. And they have to eat what I like, which is great, because I make the best huevos rancheros. Yum. So you live nearby? Yeah, down the hall. Room 111. Ah. With your husband? No. Boyfriend? No. So tell me more about your kids. Oh, my kids. Where did they go? I told them not to go outside. How old are they? 11 and 12. They're outside. Come on. Aviana? Miles? Aviana? Miles? Don't tell Dad about the dog. We stick to the plan. - Business as usual. Miles? You know, I can't believe you lost your kids. I didn't lose them. They're probably hiding somewhere. This is like that time we went camping and you lost the keys, and then we got stuck out there. Okay, I can admit this now. The keys weren't really lost. I was just trying to spend more time with you. What? You made us walk five miles to the nearest service station. That was so sweet. I'm really happy to see you. Oh, no. Quick, now. Oh, you... Hey, I could use a little help here. Yeah, no, I'm on their side. Oh, you did not. Okay, okay, okay. Aviana, Miles, come here. This is my friend, Holly. We went to college together. Nice to meet you guys. Hey. I'm starting to get these weather advisories. Winter Storm Megan is on its way. Oh, that's nice. Not if three feet of snow close our roads. Sorry, Dad. I have a lot on my mind. I can be a pretty good listener if you want to dish. Don't say "dish", Dad. I'm all yours. You know that guest that came in with his kids? Kevin Portillo? - Mm. Well, he and I used to know each other in college. So you guys were buddies? We were a bit more than buddies. You must be happy to see him. No! I mean, yes. I don't know. What happened between you two? And that is the ultimate trivia question. Oh, which I have to get ready for. Yeah. Hello. My granddaughter would like to talk to you about your Dartmouth shirt. Give me your phone number so we can meet up... to talk about college. You can text me for the meet-up. Ah. - Yeah... yes, right. - Right? Because I've already read a whole book. Duffy Johnson. Tom Anderson. Welcome back to the Treeline. You might not know this, but my grandfather gave you your first lesson. We were in ski school together.

Listen, you see that woman over there? - Which one? - The hot one. - Oh, yeah? Tom. - Tommy, you know, the manager. Tommy, I need you to be my wingman. I want to go over there and sit with her, but she's with her sister. That's where you come in. I met her sister earlier. I'll be your wingman if you play Santa Claus on Christmas Eve and ski down the mountain with a bag full of presents. The guests would love it. Why? I forgot to hire a Santa. Whatever. Deal. Let's do it. All right. Thank you. Hello. Hello, nice to... nice to see you again, Tay. I love your matching sweaters. Oh, thank you. My sister Kay got these for us. Pleasure, Kay.

Oh, yes, you did. What is it? Christmas. Now you can decorate like at home. Oh, only if you help. It's beautiful. Oh, my late wife made those. We used to run the lodge together. Well, truth is, she mostly ran the lodge, and I did whatever she said. She was a force of nature. More than any other holiday, she loved Christmas. It was her favorite time of year.

You know, I just worry about him being alone. Hmm. Family first. When my wife died, I got this great work opportunity. But it was out of town, so I couldn't take it. I needed the kids to be close to their grandparents. So I started my own company, and now I am stuck with a business partner who keeps trying to buy me out. Family first. Family first. We still have a lot in common. Hey, since Miles and Aviana will be in ski school, what do you say we hit the slopes and I finally teach you how to ski? Hmm. So it's a date. Well, a planned event we'll be at together. A date. You were really good. No, you were. You really were. I love "A Christmas Carol." Always touches me. What is that line about laughter?

You know, I'm going to stay at the lodge and help Dad. I can see why you never want to leave here. It's pretty beautiful. - Whoa. - Just relax. It's going to be okay. - You sure? Yeah, chairlifts do this all the time. If you had a wind turbine powering these lifts, you would save a fortune on your energy costs. And you'd be helping the environment. - Renewable energy. - Mm-hmm. So how's the company going? I'm thinking about taking a buyout and starting over. Starting over is a good thing.

Good kids. I hope. I'm worried about holding on to a business I'm not sure I even want. All right, let's give it a try. Whoa. Bingo. If you can fix that, you can probably fix anything.
