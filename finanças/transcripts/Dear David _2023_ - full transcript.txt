Laras? It's time to wake up! I'm up already, Mom! "Their faces are moving closer..." "Their lips are almost touching..." Laras, time to take a shower! - Laras! come on! - In a minute, Mom! OUR STORY - TIGER MAN #27 DAVID'S DAISY #26 FROM JAKARTA FOR LIVERPOOL For all Your blessings Thank you, Jesus Our praises just for You Mom, add some sausages, please? Have you been staying up late? Your face is breaking out. Do you wash your face before bed? Of course I do. Ask your sister what facial wash she's using. She's been up with the baby, but her face is cleaner now. She's pretty again. No one told her to get pregnant. She stays up late because she has too many kids. I'm staying up late to get into the UI. You never listen. You can study hard. Just don't overdo it. Have a little fun. You're still young. Go hang out with Dilla again. Are you still not speaking? THE WINNER FOR HIGH SCHOOL SHORT WRITING COMPETITION 2022, DKI JAKARTA Leaving for school, miss? Yeah. Hold on, miss. Ride carefully. Yes! Come on! Take it! Come on, bro! David! Come on! Yes! Very good! Nice play! - Good job! - Come on! - Back to your position! - Okay, get back to your position! - Good morning, Ms. Indah. - Morning, Laras. - Let me help you with those. - Here, thank you. - All good with the Cahaya Cup? - I'm drafting the proposal. But I might need to get some funding from the students. - Make sure it goes well. - Of course, ma'am. Sherin, Sindy, Sasa! Classes haven't even started and you're dancing already? Turn your phone off! Bring those to my office? Sure, ma'am. Oops! "Sure, ma'am." - Scholarship students are ass-kissers. - She has to be. Otherwise, how can she afford to come to this school? Come on. Excuse me. Is Mr. Rizky here? Not yet. I have to see him before class about last week's remedial test. What am I, his mother? What? Aren't you his assistant? What? - What do you mean? - Is something wrong? I don't know. What are you doing? Wiping this off. And soaking your shirt? Stupid girl. Hey. Have you seen the slut's latest post? She's practically naked, again. Such an attention whore. I don't understand Ms. Indah. Why hasn't she expelled that bitch? Hey, is the rumor true? She did "it" with Arya in the gym? And all the guys at school, I bet. What were they doing in the gym? "Work out" together, of course. What else? I see. Did you hear that? Look, the Three Little Pigs. - Bitch. - Come back here! Do we really look like pigs? Can you get me some toilet paper? Pass it under the door. You know my name? - What? - What? Damn! Hey, Dilla. What were you doing with Dilla? Getting your shirt wet like that. Whatever. A goody-goody church boy like you getting on with a girl like Dilla? And Arya's hand-me-down too. Chill, bro. I'm not possessive. Go for it. I need you to make this graphic chart now. This is from yesterday. In the toilet. I'll give you some first. Some first, okay? DILLA: DELETE IT! GILANG: DIGITAL FOOTPRINTS ARE FOREVER DILLA: DELETE IT!! Ras! Laras! Poor Dilla. OUR STORY Once upon a time, in a palace far away, a beautiful queen rules the land. The queen is surrounded by slaves ready to fulfill her lusty needs. You are the fairest, your royal highness. But the most special one is David, her favorite love slave, always ready to serve. His body is always available. Many slutty slaves have the nerve to flirt with her favorite toy boy. I'm so sorry. The queen is furious. And curses the handmaid. But seeing David's wet chest, the queen is suddenly overcome by lust. David has to face his punishment. OUR STORY Your light illuminates And enlightens my heart Teach me to receive Your Love, My Lord Let us pray. We are sinful and unworthy of Your love, Lord. We are begging for Your mercy. Please forgive our sins, Lord. Please forgive our sins, Lord. Have you asked your sister about facial wash? What's up, Mom? Your sister's face is breaking out from staying up late. We can talk about it later. - Hi, Mr. Dedi. - Hi, Mrs. Hana. - How are you? - I'm good. I heard David will be joining the national training camp? David is being eyed by a recruiter. That's why we are training hard for the Cahaya Cup. That's amazing. He'll be like you, the national athlete. - Which one do you want? - What's in this? Rice noodles, carrots, potato. Have you never had one? Cancel that. I'll take this one. What's in this? Same thing. You've never had this either? What's with the tone? Forget it then. What do you want? Fine, let me pick some out for you. God's children must be patient. Haven't you been listening to the sermon? Leave God out of this! My, oh, my! You're not dating yet, but bickering like a married couple. No way! How much? - It's free. - No, it's okay. No, really. Thanks. Thank you, Auntie. - Thank you, Mrs. Hana. Laras. - Yes, Mr. Dedi. God bless you. You're welcome. We go to the same church, we have to help each other. They are all so handsome. Laras! I wanted to apologize about Gilang. He sent out our picture. Usually people don't give me flowers with the pot. I thought doing this would let the flower live longer. Well then, why don't you take care of it? SOCCER TOURNAMENT CAHAYA CUP Yes, indeed. - Morning, Miss Vice President. - Shush! Hold on. "The tiger just transformed into David..." Am I going to hell for reading this? But I just can't put it down. - Where did you get this? - From Desas Desus. It went viral. This gossip account on Twitter. David asked her to have sex? On a school trip? - Seriously? - Oh my God! He's licking her? - Have you read Dear David? - Here. Have you read the part where David is a pirate? Oh my God, not yet. I'm still reading David at the goat farm. Oh my God! Where? But his amnesia's gone after he's groped. Have you read Forgive Me Father? David is a pastor! - Seriously? - Yeah! - Is it fun? - It's wild! ENDA HERIYANTO IS THE WRITER A CAHAYA HIGH STUDENT? ANNISA KUMALA OH MY GOD, END OF DAYS IS COMING... All the way! - It is, ma'am. - Come on. Not there. Up here. You're hopeless. And the other stuff. Laras, help me out. Get the shovel and the wires. - Yeah. Put them here. - Okay, ma'am. - Laras! - Anything else, ma'am? Wan! That one! Laras? You missed your dinner. Are you okay? I'm not hungry. I'll make you some porridge. No thanks, Mom. The news about this pornographic writing has reached the Foundation's chairman. The school has conducted an investigation, and found out that the last story was uploaded from a school computer last Friday. This was the only computer class on that day. So the writer must be one of you. Whoever wrote them and distributed them should come forward now. So the school can do some damage control. This is not the first time our school has dealt with pornography. Anyone? No one? Fine. If the culprit doesn't cooperate and confess, they will be expelled. Starting today, all students must report every social media account they have. - What? - How come? - Accounts should be set to "Public." - You can't do that. No "Private" setting is allowed. - Just confess, Dilla. - Why me? Your face says it all. That's not a good girl's face. Trouble-making slut! I bet you're the one who leaked the stories yourself. Sprint! Okay, go! Quickly! GOOD LUCK CAHAYA CUP PARTICIPANTS Laras! Come here. Sit down and look at this. I LOVE YOU, DAVID What's this? Isn't he hot? No wonder David has gotten 8K more followers now. - Disgusting. - I edited that. - What? You made this? - Cool, huh? Hey, the hype around Dear David is crazy! Why did we just realize that David is hot? We've been lusting over Arya all this time. Come on! - Guys, it's David's turn now! - What? Oh my God. You go, David! Come on, David! You can do it! Just take off your shirt! Oh my gosh, I can't take this anymore. What do I do? David! David! Come on, David! You can do it! No! David! What was that? Focus! If you keep playing like this, you won't even make it to the semifinal. Do the laps, now! Yes, Coach. Next! Just relax! Go! "Slowly, she caresses David's eggplant, and it's growing bigger..." Seriously? It's that big? Really? Let me see. Is it bigger than mine? - What the hell? - Show us, David. The biggest in Cahaya High. I've seen yours. I have. But is yours truly that big? Hey! Shit! - Not funny, assholes! - Why so sensitive? He's so sensitive! I'm sure David's junk is big. Gotta hurt. Why did David wet his pants? Did he pee? I want to be a sex slave too. You have to read this. Read it. "But the handmaid accidentally spills the milk all over David's chest..." "David..." "The queen stares at David's... soaking chest!" This one. Where is this one? Before we begin today's session, would anyone like to ask for absolution in front of your brothers and sisters? Yes, Abigail? I lie to my boyfriend a lot, Brother. Thank you, Abigail. You have to remember 1 Peter 3:10-11. "Honesty will lead to a peaceful life." Laras. Who do you think wrote them? I didn't write them. You didn't write what? I know you wrote them. Here. "'I hope you win, to compete in the Cahaya Cup, ' I said to David before the game began." "When he is gone, I fantasize tying him up and stripping him." This was after the election of student body president, right? Need to hear more? This was in the computer classroom. "The handmaid accidentally spilled milk on David's body." "I was furious, but David's wet chest made my lust..." Fine, I wrote them. But why? If you have a crush on me, why didn't you tell me? I don't have a crush on you. But in your writing... I picked a name randomly from the school's student list. Okay. So, you don't have a crush on me, but you used my name... What do you want, David? To embarrass me? I've had enough embarrassment from the whole school. You think you're the only one who's embarrassed? What about me? I didn't ask to be the center of attention in school, or on some gossip account... I didn't leak it, and I don't know who did, David! I didn't want it to spread either! Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't expect all this would affect you. I deleted all the stories. I've stopped writing too. Can you promise me not to tell anyone? If people find out, I'm done, David. But the problem is now everyone looks at me differently. They expect more of me. I'm just a nobody. I can't even get Dilla. So you like Dilla? Not just like... I think I love her. How is that possible when you barely speak to her? I just know. David. Why don't you just punish me? Make me do your homework or take you everywhere. I'll do it. But please, don't tell anyone I'm the writer. What if... you help me get close to Dilla? Me? You're the only kid at school who was ever her friend. It's no longer the case. I give you an inch and you take a mile. But you said "anything." Last month, the Foundation was this close to having you expelled because of your pornographic posts on social media. But I stood up for you. So please, Dilla, let's help each other out. But you don't have any proof that I wrote them. Dilla. Think about your future. It's better for you to confess now! David. Do you know who wrote these about you? No, ma'am. Mr. Rizky thinks the writer is in your class. But all traces have been deleted. You have the key to the computer classroom, right? It means you could have gotten in anytime to delete the trace. But I left the door open from morning to afternoon. And sometimes the students use the room during recess time. So, anybody could get in. You must've known who wrote the stories. When you spoke with David, did he tell you who might have written them? No. He's also in the dark. Hey, let's go to the cafeteria. I'll pay for it. Hey, you know what... Steamed chicken from my mom, for your dad. Thank you, Auntie Hana. Thanks for not telling anyone. Don't you want to find out who leaked them? No. If I ask around, people will suspect something. What are you doing? Planting this rose. It was supposed to be for Dilla. Dilla doesn't like stuff like this. She's into music, camera... Yeah, I'm the biggest fool when it comes to Dilla. I always get it wrong. It was a bad choice. I'm telling you now so you can take notes. You said you wanted to get close to Dilla. One meeting, for you and Dilla. That's my only job. If nothing comes out of it, that's no longer my problem. It's a deal. - Hey, Laras. - Hi, Uncle. Come, David. The game's starting. - Give me a minute. - Okay. - See you, Laras. - Yes, Uncle. Gotta go. Civica? Where did you steal this? I bought it with my Chinese New Year's money. For you. Can I come in? What for? - So we can talk inside. - I'm busy. - I walked all the way here. - No one told you to. You know me, I'm dramatic. I'm sorry if I did something wrong and drove you away from me. You don't even know if you did something wrong? Hey! Dildo! - My name's not Dildo! - Come here! - Give it to me! - No! Ouch! No! La! Ouch! Are you okay? It hurts. But I lied! Stop it! Go to hell. - Give me the camera! - No! - No! - Give it to me! Come on! Or I'll tickle you! What's all this? The parents' text group is on fire. There's some porn writing about David. What? The whole church can't stop talking about it. Have you read it? Why would I? Poor David. They say he's not performing well because of this. And poor Mr. Dedi too. You know he gets stressed easily. The parents are making a petition to find the writer and expel them. I'm curious what the writing is about. They just sent me the link. Here. Just a little... Don't read this stuff. - Just the beginning... - No! It's a sin! There, I deleted it! Hey! In light of the current situation, the student body and the school will hold a sex education seminar... Sex! Hey. ...that all Cahaya High students must attend at the last period of the day. Each student will be called individually to Ms. Indah's office... Sex! That... Sex! Silence! ...will start with Gilang. Sex! Gilang! Please come to Ms. Indah's office now! Thank you. Boys, follow Mr. Anton. Girls, follow me. Relax, this won't take long. I'm sure this is nothing new to you all. Especially you, Arya. Dil! Where are you going? I'd rather die than join your shitty seminar! Listen to me... You'd better go back before they see you. - Dilla, please. - What's the deal? Do you miss me... Yes, I miss you. I miss all the stupid things that can only happen when I'm with you. If you truly miss me, then let's get out of here together. Fine. Fine, come on! Let's go! I've been alive for 17 years, but never once did I play hooky. CAHAYA HIGH A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE Watch out! Hey, where are you going? Oh my God! It's raining. Two, please. Thank you. Here you go. My name is not... Whatever. Have some. It's hot! Here. Mom! - Yes? - Dilla wants a shower. - Hi, Auntie! - Hey, Dilla! Where have you been? I thought you'd forgotten about me. No way! You're all soaked. - Take your shower! - Okay. Your turn! Take this! La. Do you know why people started calling me a slut? Arya asked me to be his girlfriend in the gym. I said no. The next day, the whole school thought I had sex with him there. I was going to tell you. But for the first time in my life, I got called a slut, and the whole class laughed at me. Why didn't you stand up for me? I got a feeling that's what pulled you away from me. You pulled away from me first. You were so busy being student body president. But didn't you refuse to sit next to me in class? - You were ashamed to sit next to a slut. - Dil! You're not a slut. I'm sorry. Ready for Ms. Indah? Come on. - Dildo! - What? Ms. Indah didn't only punish me, but you too! A little help? We can finish sooner! And go back to class sooner? What for? It's better to hang around here and watch you all miserable. You're a bitch! I saw you playing with your phone during math test the other day. Well, you know I suck at math. Of course I know. Want to study together? I'll invite David, okay? He's been begging me. He's afraid he'll be off the team 'cause his grades are bad. I feel bad for him. Thought I'd do him a favor. He'll just have weird ideas. He and I know you're not the writer. Tell that to Ms. Indah. And those Three Little Pigs over there! I'll tell David and we'll set up a date. Okay. Speaking of David, have you seen the latest upload on social media? I WASH AWAY MY THIRST ON THE SOCCER FIELD Ms. Indah will be so mad at me. I'm so emotionally invested! Too much sport though. I can't relate. I like the part where David is tied up to the goal post and gets stripped. You know what? I cried my eyes out when David has to go to England to play for Liverpool. - Me too! My eyes are still puffy. - Oh, yeah! So sad... Why are you so obsessed with Dear David? It's so addictive! Now I want to try and write too. - Don't you feel bad for David? - What? Besides, thanks to Dear David, all the sponsors pulled out. Hey! You're still here? The semifinal's coming. Let's study together tomorrow. You, me, and Dilla. Tomorrow? Are you serious? I can't, I'm not ready. Tell you what. Imagine I'm Dilla. Okay. It's hard. Okay, hold on. Okay. Okay. So, what do you like about me? I don't know. Don't give an answer like that. Such a conversation killer! Okay, let me try again. I like your personality. Be more specific. I like how free-spirited you are. And brave. Brave to go anywhere, to do anything. Come to think of it, you remind me of my late mother. Total Oedipus complex! What's that? - Why are you so dressed up? - Am I? I got it. Okay, come on in. Center point coordinates and circle radius x²-y²-4x+6y+4 = 0 is... Hold on. C! It's D. You just have to find the number derivative. (x-2)²+(y+3)² equals to 9. So the answer is 2-3. Get it? I get it. Good. Where are you going? Bathroom. You want to come with me? Do you have any plans this weekend? David. You know I didn't write Dear David, right? - I know. - How did you know? La, do you want some tea? Yes, please! - I want this one. - Sure. La, what's your plan for tomorrow? Let's go out! It's been a while since we hung out. I can't make it tomorrow. Actually, I can. But I can't stay out too late. Yes! Can we take your motorbike? My car's not available. Why don't we ask David to drive us? I'm too lazy to drive anywhere far. What? We go to the same church. We can go from there and pick you up. What's wrong? Is he bugging you? - If so, we'll just ditch him... - Do you have a crush on David? Hell no. You really need me around to get close to him? What? I don't want you to end up with David. Why not? Do you like him? Do you want me to like him? Well, if you do, go for it. He's a good guy. Can we change the music? - I love... - I love this song! Since when? Didn't you say it's too mainstream? I like it too, Dil. Your taste is not so bad after all. - Are you okay? - Sure! Hi! Hello! Hey, look. Clown fish. Looks just like you. And you look like the rock over there. Not even a fish, just decoration. So, you agree? You look like a clown fish? At least I'm not some piece of stone. - I'd rather be that than... - Let's go! I want to see the mermaids. - Cool, let's go. - Come on! - Mind your head! - Sure. - All good? - Yeah. Laras! Picture time! Come here! Take a picture! Come on! Look, I took these. With Dilla. Say cheese! Bye... Hi! Okay, thank you. Thank you. Want to try touching it? It makes me cringe! - Give me your hand! - David! - It makes me cringe! David! - Try it. It makes me cringe! I don't believe you. Just try. I don't want to! Why don't you try? - It's okay! - So weird! - Now, you try! The pornographic story of Dear David has gone viral on the internet. Until now, the writer behind these stories is suspected to be a Cahaya High student. Here you go, miss. Just admit it! This has been going on for too long! I want you to make an apology. In writing! Ma'am, anyone could have used my name! You're suspended for ten days! I'm confiscating your phone. I didn't write them. Do you even listen to me? Your phone! Your phone! You can use this extra free time for a little self-reflection. And ask yourself why you're such an attention seeker. Dilla, I'm sure you can be a better person. Ma'am, I don't want to be a better person. I just want to be myself! I didn't leak or write the Dear David stories! What's with the fishnet stockings? Are you doing a fashion show? Lower. - But it's only a centimeter too short. - It shouldn't be too short at all. Boys will give you weird looks. Yeah, whatever. This is too much! You're the student body president. You can put a stop to this. My hands are tied. Lower it. Lower! I didn't expect it would come to this. I didn't know Ms. Indah would take it this far. What do we do now? if you want to move to a different school? No. I've moved around too much. Put this under the shirt. There are only a few pins left. There aren't many differences if this is under it. CAUGHT! THE ALLEGED STUDENT THAT WROTE DEAR DAVID SUSPENDED! IT'S GOOD, SO SHE CAN NO LONGER SEEK MY BOYFRIEND'S ATTENTION. INCOMING CALL: DILLA (NEW) Yeah. Forget it. It's okay. Like this. Good enough? We tuck it in or not? Yes, tuck it in. Cahaya! Cahaya! - David! - David! Goal! Yeah! CAHAYA CUP COMMITTEE Get off the field, attention whore! Go away, slut! Now you're my boyfriend. You did it, bro! David! David! Based on your midterm exams, we decided to further decrease your tuition fee next semester. We hope you continue to make us proud. Go ahead, you can cry if you want. Must be emotional for you. Mr. Rolla ordered 123 sacks of cement, but you only sent him 119 sacks. He just texted me to complain. And now, the number of this green paint is 021, not 020. Don't make any more mistakes. He's a loyal customer. I'm so embarrassed. Yes, ma'am, sorry. I spaced out. Don't worry. I'll send over the rest tomorrow. Fine. What's wrong, dear? I got an extra scholarship. Praise the Lord! I'm so proud of you. Why the long face? You should be happy. Wait here. This is for the retreat. Retreat? That's right. The Church Youth Commission Retreat. Relax, I already signed you up. Mr. Dedi said David will be going too. It's fun, right? You two can have fun there. What's wrong? Nothing. Dilla... - Dildo. - What? Call me Dildo. Come on. Dildo... Dildo... Dildo... Laras! I need to talk. Laras! What? Later. I want to sleep. It's a long trip. The one in the middle is our villa. Laras! I want to tell you something. So, Dilla and I kissed. Yes, we all saw it. Good then, my work is done. No... Not like that. I mean... we really kissed. And it's nothing like I expected. Maybe I need more practice? Congratulations. What? Why are you upset? Shouldn't you be happy? I'm not happy. Right, I haven't paid you for your mission. What do you want? Anything. Sushi. Damn, so expensive. Dear Lord, we are grateful for Your absolution... for all our sins. Lord, we are also grateful for Your unwavering love throughout our lives. Please teach us how to forgive ourselves. Deliver us, Lord, from this binding guilt. And please grow new seeds within our souls. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Hallelujah, amen. We have prepared signs along this path. Use your lights to follow the signs to the next post. And don't forget to ask the post guard for a token after you complete the game. "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation." "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." Let's start. Come on. Will there be a ghost? Did you bring a spare battery? I forgot to change mine. It's in my room. Just use mine. It's bright enough. Want to hold it? No, it's fine. What's wrong? There's something over there. What is it? - A ghoul? - Silence. Are you scared? If a ghost pops up, think of its head as a ball, kick it hard... Laras. Okay. Come on. David? Vid? David? David! David, what's wrong? Wait here. I'm okay. I just need to take a breath. Please, don't leave me. I'm going to die here. David, you're not going to die here! Can you not stay quiet like this? What do you want me to do? You like telling stories, right? Tell me a story. Once upon a time... there lived a writer... in a cottage by the sea. She is writing her new novel... but she runs out of ideas. Writer's block. Then she meets a soccer player on the beach. Apparently, they both are running away from the bustling city life. The soccer player, what does he look like? He's well-built. He has clear skin. A thin mustache. His eyes are warm... but they can be piercing if you mess with him. In their escape, they grow close. They are enjoying a simple life on the beach. But as time flies by... everything must come to an end. The soccer player has to go home for his game. And after the game, he will marry his fiancée. Before he goes, the writer gives him a letter and asks him to read it when he gets home. What does the letter say? Things she's always wanted to say to him. Why doesn't she tell him directly? She's afraid. She'd rather try to forget everything. For him and his fiancée's happiness... the writer is willing to sacrifice her own. But the writer also deserves to be happy. Laras. David, what happened to you? Do you have panic attacks often? My mom had unstable moods. Sometimes, she'd lock herself up in her room all day. But whenever she was happy, she was the most pleasant person. She really was. When I was little, she took me to the forest to look for a waterfall. But what happened was, we got lost. That was the first time I hyperventilated. Since I decided to take up soccer, I often hyperventilate. At first, I thought I had a heart condition. But during the medical check-up to make the team, I asked the doctor, and he said there's nothing wrong with my heart. How did your dad react when he found out? Dad doesn't know, and he can't know. My dad left us when I was in fourth grade. So I understand where you're coming from. Sometimes I think, "Did he leave because of me?" Maybe I'm not good enough as a daughter. That's why I want to be a good kid. I want to be somebody. Make a lot of money. And have a cottage by the beach? CHATS - DAVID I WAS WONDERING HOW THE STORY GOES. Years pass by... the soccer player returns to the cottage. But the writer is no longer there. He never read the letter. Maybe opening the letter is too hard for him, reminding him of the wonderful times with the writer. A long time passes. Finally, he is ready. He opens the letter. And it reads... "Dear David..." You went after me... Want me to leave you alone? YEARS PASS. THE SOCCER PLAYER RETURNS TO THE LIGHTHOUSE. DEAR DAVID, I LOVE YOU. YOURS, THE WRITER, LARAS. "Yours, the writer, Laras." Dil, I just wanted to say... What are you doing? I got suspended, ostracized, and got bullied by the whole school. I promised Laras. Promised her what? I promised Laras I wouldn't say a word about Dear David. As long as she helped me get close to you, Dil. I'm an asshole, Dil. But Laras didn't... Laras! You need to know about your text last night. - Sorry, I didn't reply right away. - Vid... Just forget I ever texted anything. Dilla read it accidentally. She knows everything. - What do you mean? - David! We have to talk to her. Hey, it's Laras. The writer. Oh my gosh, Ras... You're kind of cool. And poetic too! Student body president with a damn dirty mind! Horny girl, bro! Enough! Shut up, all of you! Laras... Write us more stories. PLOT TWIST! THIS IS THE REAL FACE OF DEAR DAVID'S WRITER! Well, Laras... You're still not confessing? I'm confiscating your phone for evidence. No, ma'am. A cell is personal property. You have no right... You want me to expel you right now? I'm sick and tired of this case. You have until tomorrow... to confess. I know I made a mistake. Why did you have to tell everyone? I've fought for my scholarship, my position... Everything is about you. I'm ashamed I was ever your friend. I feel sorry for your mom for having a daughter like you. Laras! Laras! I'm so stupid. I've put my own best friend through hell. I messed up everything. If only I hadn't written about you... Come on. You go ahead. I'm going home. Don't be afraid. God is forgiving. It's not about God, Mom. Come. It's Mrs. Hana's daughter. Mrs. Hana's daughter... - Right, it's her. - Her name is Laras, and her mom is Hana. Right, I had no idea she could write such a thing. They go to church, but the child is troublesome. She writes porn stories and leaked it to everyone. Poor mother. Oh my God... She's a troublemaker. Poor education makes problematic kids. You do know I might get expelled from school, right? I know. My life is over, Mom. If you get expelled, just move to another school. If you can't get to the college you want because of this, find another college. But it means I'm a failure. We're all failures at some point in our lives. But I want to be more than that, Mom. And I know I can be. For me, for you. For me, having you as my daughter is enough. I never ask for anything more. For all Your blessings Thank you, Jesus Our praises just for You Honey. It's okay. Dilla! Dilla. I'm down here, Dil. What are you doing, La? La! La! What's that? Antiseptic from your mom. No, that's gonna hurt like hell. - Let me see it. - No! Just a little! Oh my... It hurts! Enough! It hurts so much! All right... It hurts! It hurts. Ouch. I want you to go home now. If you want me to go home, drive me. You know what? You're such a handful. I'm not a good friend to you, Dil. I'm a bad friend. You're a bad friend. You got me into trouble and you're stupid. You set me up with David even though you have a crush on him. Now what do you regret the most? The fact that everyone knows you're the porn writer, or the fact that you got me together with David? The fact that I hurt you, Dil. I'm used to getting hurt by you. You don't even realize it, do you? How much I hurt every day because of you. Do you know what it feels like to love someone who doesn't love you back? But I do love you. Yeah, as a friend, right? Why didn't you tell me? But I can't... I can't have you see me as a freak. Dil... You are not a freak. I don't want to lose you, La. You won't. In fact, I'm thankful that someone has been loving me all this time. And that someone is you. So I don't want you to go through all this alone. And I'll be here for you. A lot of people want you to get expelled. Don't ask me how many parents came directly to me, to the Foundation, even your own friends. But I'm still fighting. We've decided not to expel you. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you so much. You'll need to issue an apology. Here's the draft. You have to make this statement during the flag ceremony. We will revoke your scholarship. But you may stay because of your academic achievement. We need you so we can become the top-ranking school in Jakarta. So, we are helping each other here. Do you understand? How about the person who leaked the stories? We suspect that Arya did it. So, we'll both apologize this Monday? No, just you. Just me? Well, you're the one who wrote the stories. So, you're the one to apologize for causing trouble and disgracing the school. But it's not fair, ma'am! Or do you prefer to get expelled? So you leaked it? David! - David! - Have you lost your mind? - Stop it! - You're all out of your minds! Why did you leak them? I just thought it's funny. But you see? Now you're the school hero. Let's get out of here! Come on! David! Guys, let's go! Cahaya! Let's go, boys! Let's go! You can do this. We can do it! Come on! Focus! Communicate with each other! Let's win this, okay? Let's go! Let's go! Three, two, one! Cahaya! Come on! You can do it! Go, Cahaya! Go, David! - What's going on? - David! What's wrong with David? David. - Are you okay? - David! You take his place. What's with him? David, what's wrong? I'm okay, Dad. You're having a panic attack. Take a breath slowly. Vid! Just take a breath! I don't know, Dad. I feel like... I'm going crazy. Calm down, Vid. Easy now. Relax. Calm down. Breathe... I don't want to end up like Mom. Come here. CERTIFICATE - AWARD I'd like to invite Laras from Class XI A IPS to the stage to say an important message. Quiet, everyone! Laras... Good morning, Ms. Principal, the teachers and staff, and my dear friends. My name is Laras Susanto, and I'd like to say a few words. First... I would like to apologize to David, for making him an object in my writing. Secondly... my sincerest apology to my best friend, Dilla, who, because of my dishonesty, had to endure hatred and bullying from her schoolmates, including the teachers and the principal. My congratulations to Arya for leaking and sharing my writing. Those stories were not supposed to be read and enjoyed by anyone but myself! Enjoyed? I also congratulate the school, an educational institution, that claims it has enforced justice by only punishing me, and not the one who violated my rights. To this school, private spaces don't mean shit. And lastly... I want to apologize to myself. I shouldn't feel ashamed or guilty. I'm a passionate, young person... and a woman in love. Is that wrong? I don't think so. Yeah, Laras! Silence! Go, Laras! Silence! Laras! With all due respect, we are asking you not to continue your senior year in Cahaya High School. Very well, ma'am. You rock! "Dear David, I love you." "Yours, the writer, Laras." I just want to say that I also... How does it feel to swim with the fishes? Feels like... I'm flying together with them. - Flying? - Yeah. I'm Anya. Dilla. Mr. David? MARDI KUSWANTO, MD - PSYCHIATRIST Fendi... Auntie, have you read Dear David? Hey! Don't give her ideas. Dilla. I think Laras has so much potential to become a famous writer. You're dead. Mom, don't! Relax, dear. I told you I will never read them. Good. Now, she is making her way through the jungle... without having to find somebody to make her happy. Because being her is enough. And for the first time in her life, she feels at peace. What? Oh, dear Lord. Ma'am. Oh my! What? Wahyu? Ma'am? What? Sorry. Was the order seven or eight sacks? What? Eight?
