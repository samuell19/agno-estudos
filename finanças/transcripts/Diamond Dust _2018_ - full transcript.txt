The darkest times in the history of nations are those in which... man believes evil is the only way to good. From the book "Secret societies" by Ali Adham The 9th of January, 2018 Dad. Dad. Dad! Dad! Dad! 65 years ago. My people... Egypt has passed a hard time in its history... In 1952, Major General Mohamed Naguib, aided by revolutionary officers, lead a military coup against King Farouk, the ruler of Egypt that was under British colonialism... in that time. We have purified ourselves... The coup resulted in ending the monarchy, and the establishment of the Republic of Egypt. And Naguib became president, and started implementing the principals of the revolution. Has soiled the reputation of Egypt, especially... Naguib wanted... to lay the foundations of democracy, and return the power to the people. But, those around him had differently ideas. In November of 1954, President Mohamed Naguib was forced out of office. Dear Citizens... And Gamal Abdel Nasser took power. As we're speaking to you today, we're speaking about... And to this day, we're living the repercussions of that decision. For brotherly love... between all the peoples of the world. I also hope... that the new year... should mark the end of divided religions, and a guide... for human relations... in the interest... of a lasting peace. The Egyptian people's... faithful to it's traditional love, for peace and freedom. Believes also in the right for all the peoples of the world... to live freely and peacefully. Close up shop, and get out of here. Not only for other part of the world... but also for Egypt in safeguarding... where it's been and... - This is the right of history. - Happy New Years 1955! That I congratulate our christian brothers... through the world on the new year occasion. Turab Al mas - Diamond Dust President Gamal Abdel Nasser made an announcement to the world... on the occasion of the new year. - How are you, Touna? - How are you, Uncle Hanafi? I got some jasmine worthy of being on your neck. Thank you, Uncle Hanafi Papsi, don't! Hey, Hanafi. In this annual party... organized by the red crescent... on the week of light and hope... I'm telling you, King Farouk would eat 40 roasted birds... when he'd get drunk. No, the cook said 50. Come on, 40 is reasonable. 50 is just too much. See? Even the wall can't tolerate the picture of the guy. Have you heard? The king was sneaked into Italy. And he was arrested. He must have done something wrong. They'll let him out soon. No, they won't let him out. And we're going to get kicked out of the country. What're you saying, man? Who are they going to kick out? The Jews? You're Egyptian. And the picture that just fell off the wall... is a proof they're brave men. That's ancient history, Hanafi. Nowadays, soldiers are riding cars. And they're into royal suits. I'm talking about something else entirely. Keep it between us. Someone higher up... told me, it's best if I leave the country on my own, and save my dignity. There are dark days ahead of us. Days with no hope. What's keeping you up so late, Hussein? Mom got mad at me, and took my ball. Because I broke Farouk's window. Even through I said sorry. Mm-hm. When we do something wrong, we have to pay for it. Even if we apologize. You want me to tell you a story? Once upon a time, there was a boy who was a good student. He was a good friend. And he stood up for himself. He never wronged anyone. But, if anyone tried to wrong him or his country, they'd be in big trouble. Do you know who this boy grew up to be? He is... Gamal Abdel Nasser. Do you understand? Got it? Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Hanafi! Hanafi! What's wrong, Hanafi? What is it? Hanafi. Hanafi. Hanafi. Hanafi. Hanafi. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! New Year's Eve, 2018. Alahram newspaper Headline: New constitutional amendment... for the stability of the nation or the ones in power? Hey, hey. Turn it off, Taha. Good evening, Dad. Were you sleeping? Good evening, dear. It's okay, it's okay. I've got it. Did you get the biscuits? Yes, I got the biscuits, and a delicious cake too. Are you watching those people? The dog's tail. I'll never understand the relationship between you two. You've cut him off for years, then you asked to see him two weeks ago. And now, he's "The dog's tail". I'll never understand. What did he do that upset you? No. I'm just too old for the grudges. Sometimes, we have to make small mistakes in order to fix the big ones. You want my opinion? Mm. We should find you a woman to marry, and she'll make you feel 50 years younger. Stop being sarcastic, boy. By the way, tell me about that cute girl you liked in college. - Whatever happened to her? - Well, she got married. I swear she got married. And she has kids. She has a girl and a boy now. Cute little kids. A beautiful woman is a big problem. Your mom, for instance. Is the cake delicious? I'm going to the pharmacy in a bit. Do you need me to do anything for you before I go? Be careful, you have high blood sugar. Don't forget to take the insulin. No, you see, these are the prices. The Dollar is going up. Okay, I'll call you back in 10 minutes. Bye. I want this lotion, please. I wonder, if people died in today's bombing attacks? Wael. Wael? Dr. Sameh wants to talk to you on the phone. Thank God, I managed to catch you, Ma'am. This lotion has pig fat in it. Pig fat? Dr. Taha, there isn't anyone on the other end. The line must've been cut off, Wael. It's something only pharmacists know. That'll be 10 pounds. You live on the third floor of our building, right? Ah, you're the one who plays the drums all night? The sound reaches up to me. It's very annoying and out of tune. We still have 5 Atenolols. Pulmicort, 5 ml, we still have... three. Sorry sir, this is a prescription drug. You need a prescription. Sir, I can't give you this drug without a prescription. Wael! Wael! Wael! No, doctor, I wouldn't make a big fuss over it. There are about 40 cases filed against this guy, Sirvis. I myself have filed 30 reports on him. No sir, I am determined to file a case against him. Please. Please. File a case, son. Something smells good, Aunty. Hey, Aunty's favorite boy. Go on, go wash up. Your dad is up. He's waiting for you inside. You know, some people keep cats as pets. Or turtles. Or even snakes. But a crow, Dad? Do you know that crows... are the only birds that punish offenders in their fleets? They kill the offending bird, and bury it. A crow taught Cain how to bury Abel. But, people have been corrupted... more than they're already corrupt. Is that why you're not eating anything? Why are you late? Today, this huge guy called Sirvis came to the pharmacy. He wanted to get a hard drug. I refused. He broke the glass window display. So, I reported him to the police. Taha. The law only protects those who know someone in power. If he came to the pharmacy again, give him what he wants, For the sake of your old man. Okay, Dad. Don't worry. After lunch, I want to go down and have a look around the street. Okay. I'll go in and rest a bit. Here we go. One, two. Take me to Mahrous Birgass. That Mahrous Birgass? What do you want him for? He's my friend, and I want to have a cup of tea with him. Hussein! Good morning. Come over and drink some tea. Suleiman is saying "Good morning". Ignore him. Where to, sir? Please, give this to Mr. Birgass. Requests must be submitted on 34th Justice street. Who said this was a request? Give this to him and say it's from Hussein Zaharbar. He knows who I am. Mr. Birgass will see you now. No, no, no. Wait for me here, Taha. Justice in the extreme is often unjust. Jean Racine. To tell you the truth, sir, it's a great honor to meet you. I follow Saint Macarius. We're the Dahars. We live across the street from you. Sir, you wrote that it's a very urgent matter, what is it? I hope it all goes well. Sir, can I get a glass of water first, so I can take my medicine? And if we can have some heavy tea to drink together, I would be very grateful. Get us two cups of tea, Mohamed. And a cup of water, please. Please, hurry up a little. I have a meeting in a few minutes. Yes, sir. Well sir, there are two things actually. The first thing is... I have the paper with me. Just a second, the paper I wrote the notes on, I can't find it Oh my, the tea arrived so quickly. The tea is done so quickly here. My, my. Thank you very much. Thanks, thanks a lot. I'm... I'm sorry, sir. I... I can't find the paper with my notes. If I could please have a copy of your famous book "The scale", I would be grateful. I believe I saw it... on the last shelf in the corner, sir. How old is Mr. Birgass? I mean, he has pictures next to the king. - There you go. - Thank you so much. Sorry for the trouble. Right away. Alright, sir. At the end of page 271, you talked about the position of the legislator. And you said, it's a position that gives one immunity... of being put out of office, or put under scrutiny, or having one's decisions altered. My question for you, sir, is... What if... that person, the legislator, acted on a whim, had a moment of weakness, what will happen then? The legislator is God's hand on earth. He sees things that you cannot. His long experience... guarantees... that he can control his weakness and whims. Sir, I came here certain that I would be enlightened by your answer. God bless you, sir. God bless you. I won't take more of your time. I'm just here because... I had a dream about you yesterday. If this is some ploy to ask for money, You're delusional. God gave me a gift. And it never failed. I dreamed, you were in a bedroom. And a friend of mine walked in. He took you by the hand, and you two walked out. And what's the big deal if I met a friend of yours in the dream? Well, my friend who held your hand and walked away... died two years ago. And when a dead person takes someone in a dream, well, look it up in an oneiromancy book. That is nonsense. I don't know you. You don't have to know me for me to have a dream about you. Consider me as a messenger who came to warn you... that your days on this earth are numbered. Look through your old notebooks. Look for the things you don't want to remember. When we do something wrong, we have to pay the price. Even if we say sorry. Thank you for the tea. Let's go, Taha. Taha. Walk by my side. How are you feeling? Great, Dad. I'm going to sit on that last bench over there. Why here? Candy, Dad? Two of them? Where did you get them? I'll allow it just for today to keep you in a good mood. You candy... smuggler. This moment calls for a selfie. We don't have many pictures of us together. Ready? Dad. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Did you find out when you're getting a vacation? Not before the promotions. I want the rest of the money for the diamond ring tomorrow. It's only a quarter of a carat. Go to the restaurant tomorrow. Tell the accountant to give you the money. Did you have lunch? Yeah. The restaurant sent me a steak to eat on the street. On the street? There was a murder. Someone broke into a paralyzed man's house and killed him. And his son happened to come by. Was he killed as well? No. The son is in a coma. But, he's going to die. Taha. Taha. Can you hear me? Can you talk? - Where am I? - In the hospital. You've been in a coma for a week. You're lucky to be alive. Where's my dad? Thank God you're okay, Taha! I heard you're great at playing drums. I'm a pharmacist. - Who are you? - Waleed. Colonel Waleed Sultan. The inspector of Wasat region. Where's my dad? Can you wait for him to come to a bit more before questioning him? As you know ma'am, The best time to question someone is right when they wake up. Can you wait for me outside please? Your dad is paralyzed, Taha. We don't want to exhaust him. But hopefully, you'll get better soon and get out to go see him. Now, tell me what happened on the day of the incident. Write it down, son. We, the inspector Waleed sultan, we're at... etc... Um, I went home, I found my dad's wheelchair upside down, I called out, but he didn't answer. I got in the room... Did you see anyone? Did you hear anything? I don't remember. Does your father have any enemies? No, not at all. And you? The day before yesterday, there was a guy called Sirvis. He came to the pharmacy where I work, and broke the window glass. But, that was a week ago, Taha. Aunty. Where's Dad? Listen, Taha. You're a respectable... and a pious young man. I need to tell you something. May your dad rest in peace! Close the record, let's go. Where's Dad? Where's my dad, Aunty? Where is he? Dad. Dad! Come back, Taha. I can walk on my own, Aunty. Dad. Dad! Dad! Good morning. Hello, doctor, good morning. Go right ahead. How are you doing, Taha? I'm much better. Your discharge order is being written right now. And this prescription has all the medicines you'll be taking. And when is this jitter going away? You got hit in the temporal lobe. Your jittery hands are the result of a nerve damage. It will get better within year with medical treatment. Memory might take some time. You'll get annoying migraines. I'm not trying to scare you, but you need to know that if you were shocked, you might get a seizure. Please, take your medication regularly. Get well soon. Where's Taha Dahar's room please? Thanks. Welcome, welcome, welcome, dear! Welcome. Welcome, dear. Come in, come in. Come in. See that, Taha? An angle God sent you from Heaven. Welcome. Thank God, you're okay. Thank you. Have a seat. Have a seat, dear. Aunty said, you're the one who saved me. What... What happened exactly? The elevator was out of service. So, I went up the stairs. I saw you laying in front of the apartment door. There was a pool of blood under your head. I freaked out. I called the doorman to pick you up. Then I went into the apartment and found... Anyway, the police questioned me. Did you know who did it? I hope you find out. If you need anything, you know I'm on the third floor. Sure thing. Take care of yourself. Sarah. Thank you. "I seek refuge in God from the cursed Satan" "In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful" "Yâ-Sîn, By the Wise Quran" "You are indeed one of the messengers" "On a straight path" "With a revelation from the Powerful, the Merciful" "So that you warn a people whose forefathers were not warned" "So they are heedless" "The decree [of punishment] has been passed against most of them" "For they will not believe" I want you to go back home and rest. Go back home? You've been in the hospital with me for 10 days, you haven't had any sleep. And I... I need to be alone. I'm going to the police to see where the case is at. Son, going out is bad for you. - I'm fine now. - Son. 12:30 is too much. - Good evening. - 12:30 is too much. Good evening. Good evening Engineer. - Good evening, Sarah. - Good evening. Khaled, check how much time we have before we go live. And how many ads we have at the break? - Okay. - Prepare the shooting area. - Get rid of anyone we don't need. - Got it. The last anise cup was really sweet. And we all know the boss likes his anise without sugar. Please, make it without sugar next time. Good evening everyone. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. What's the news? Mm. - Can we stay a little late? - Your mic is on. Really? Thank you. - Without sugar. - You're the sugar. - Tell me, do I look okay? - Yes. - Is it good? - Mm. - Is it 28 or 29? - 29, I'll be there to help you. I don't get what you're worried about. It'll take him an hour to get here from Cairo. We'll relax, chat, and get away from stress. We owe it to ourselves. Do you know how long has it been since I've gotten a massage? Like 6 months. And you'll be back by 9... before he comes. - Hello. - Hello. - Can I see Mr. Waleed? - What is your name? - Taha Hussein Dahar. - Wait a little bit. Alright. Okay, darling. Talk to you later. Bye. - Taha Hussein Dahar. - What? Taha Hussein Dahar, from the building at the square. Let him in. How are you Taha? - Mr. Waleed. - How have you been? Have a seat. What would you like to drink, Taha? Tea? Coffee? I have hibiscus too. Tea would be great. Uh, any news on the case? Listen, Taha. - Two cups of tea. - Right away, sir. Listen, Taha. The forensics team have done a full scan of the apartment. There are no fingerprints, except your own, your dad's, and your aunt's, of course. The door is intact. There is no sign of a break-in. So, it's highly possible that your dad knew the killer. My dad had nothing to be afraid of. He opened the door to everyone. We questioned everyone who lives in the building. The girl that found you in the stairs, the doormen, the neighbors, delivery guys. And your aunt told me that... none of the family members come to visit you that day. And unfortunately, shops' security cameras in the surrounding... don't have a view of the building entrance. But, don't worry, Taha. I swear to you, Taha. I've got all the police-force of Wasat working on it. Well, what's supposed to happen now? Worst case scenario, the D.A would postpone the case until new evidence emerges. That's all just routine stuff, of course. Can I ask you for something, sir? Of course, dear. Can I look at my dad's case file? If you insist. Here. Good morning, sir. How is Your Honor? Great. Rest assured, sir. It'll all be over in a few days. Okay, sir. Give my regards to your wife and daughter. Well, okay, as you like. Goodbye, sir. See you later. The person who hit my dad was left-handed. What? The blow was on the right side of my dad's head. That's right. Well done! Yeah. Left-handed. You should work with us. Well, what about Sirvis? He was summoned by the prosecution. He confirmed that he was with Mr. Mahrous Birgass... at the time of the crime. Mahrous Birgass. Dad and I visited him a day before the incident. What was the reason for the visit? I don't know. My dad met with him alone. Mm. I see. I want you to understand something, Taha. Listen. People like... It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's alright. - Thank you. - Here's some tissue. I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it. It's okay, it's okay. Listen, Taha. People like Mahrous Birgass, with all his past, he has to have a rabid dog with him... to do his dirty work for him, and collect votes... and terrorize people during election seasons. That's what Sirvis is for Mr. Mahrous Birgass. But, when Mahrous Birgass... senses that the dog has gone mad, he'll be the first to shoot him down. His reputation is a red line. So, I don't want you to take it personally. I don't want this to upend your life. And one more thing. I need you to go to a psychiatrist. There's no shame in that, and it'll be a big relief. And I promise, if anything pops up, I'll call you. On Sunday morning of November 14, 1954, President Mohamed Naguib entered the Abdin palace. He got out of his car. And he was surprised to see that soldiers weren't saluting him. An hour later, he received a message that changed the course of history. The leadership board of the revolution decided... The leadership board of the revolution decided... to dismiss him from the Presidency of the Republic. Naguib calmly got up. - And he promised... - And he promised... - to return home in a few days. - to return home in a few days. - He indeed returned, - He indeed returned, - but after 29 years. - but after 29 years. In his memoirs, Naguib said... the cause of the disagreement... - was cronyism. - was cronyism. Those in power protect their own interests. We got rid of one king, and got 1,000 others in his place. And there was another disagreement. Arrests and prosecutions he didn't approve of, and many other things. What matters is that Naguib... wanted to give the power back to the people... by holding elections... like the ones we see today. But, they were faster. I wonder, where would we be today... If Naguib was just one step faster than them? If Naguib was just one step faster than them? We'll discuss that after the break. Welcome to "The Mirror". Rest in peace, Suleiman Lord Twitter is one fire. And Facebook too. How long is the break? We have 3 minutes of commercials. - Mahrous Birgass. - Microphone. Okay. Here. Mr. Mahrous Birgass. Thank you, sir. Sir, you know I'm always neutral. No sir, can't do. History is history. We can't deny it or alter it. You know that the first hand. Okay. I hope, I hope, sir, that you wait until... you've seen the full episode before you judge. Thank you, sir. Of course, sir. Go ahead, go ahead. - He sounds upset? - Yes, of course. It hit him where it hurts. The elections. But, I recorded the call to catch if he raises his voice. - How about? - Hm? We get sushi after the episode? - Please. - Let's go. Sarah, how are you? I haven't heard the drums since you came back from the hospital. I thought I'd check on you. Thank you. Please, come in. Don't be shy. I know you're staying here alone, and you definitely play the drums. Any news about the case? If there is no new evidence, the perpetrator will remain anonymous. Would you like some tea? So, what did your father do for a living? He was a history teacher. That explains why you have so many books. Mm. That was the only thing he did for fun. It's weird that we met just a day before the incident. Yeah, it is weird. What's your sign? Aquarius. Someone who looks calm, but there are turbulent emotions behind that calm veneer. You're into signs? A little. It's a way to study people. I'm a Gemini. Nice to meet you, Gemini. So, do you live alone? My mom and dad live in Abu Dhabi. I rent a place close to work. I'm the producer of the show "The Mirror with Mr. Murad". Do you watch it? To be honest, I haven't watched T.V. in 7 years. But, yeah, I've heard of it. I'll introduce you one day. You'll like it. I have to go. I have work to do. Hand me the drugs. That'll be 5 pounds. That guy better leaves this place. If he threatened you, I'll just leave. Honestly, son. I don't know what to tell you. Hello. - Good evening. - Son. I'm Dr. Zahi Mahran. We know you well, doctor. What do you want to order? Enduronyl, Zolmitriptan, And a 10 ml syringe. Can you get to me in 10 minutes? I'll have someone here deliver it right away, sir. What's the address? It's the Birgass villa, in the square. It'll be there in 10 minutes. Bye. Dr. Sameh, I'll leave like the guy wants me to. But, I have one final request. What? I want to deliver this order myself. - Hello, son. - Good evening, sir. Sadly, the nurse who was staying here with him passed away. And I need someone to help me. - If you'll excuse me for a minute. - Of course. Engineer Hani. His condition hasn't changed? I'm sorry to say, it's gotten worse. - Sir. - Mm? - Do you remember me? - Hm? My father and I paid you a visit a while back. He was in a wheelchair if you recall. He was killed. What did he want from you? Your father... told me about a dream. A dream... in which I die. How much time do we have? It's in a matter of weeks. Did you meet the guy called Sirvis the same day? Are you done son? Yes, doctor. Going out in daylight The book of the dead I am your beloved son, Horus. When will I avenge you, father Osiris, for all that evil Set has done? You've put your enemy under your feet forever, victorious Osiris. The first time I felt scared... Dad. - was after my father died. - Dad. Dad! Dad. We sold the perfume shop. We needed the money. - Uncle Leto helped us. - Leto Jewelry He trained me in the diamond trade, and paid for my education expenses. I was like a son of his. He would give me a tip, every time I get him something during the Sabbath. His daughter... was the first love of my life, and maybe the last. The most beautiful girl in the Jewish quarter. Her laugh... was like the laugh of Marilyn Monroe. She had a cat named... Papsi. One day, that cat got mad. Uncle Leto said, we had to get rid of the cat. She cried. Uncle Leto hated upsetting her. He ask me... to get him the powder we use to polish the diamonds. He put some in the milk porridge, and then he asked me not to tell anyone. Don't tell anyone, Hussein, okay? Sometimes, we make small mistakes... in order to fix a massive one. Against our will. I didn't realize what we were doing then. But a week later, I understood. That cat bled to death. And that was how the curse started. The government apprehended a network of Jewish spies... responsible for the bombings. The case was known as "The Lavond scandal". Lavond... The were sentenced to death. They started leaving, one by one. And fear... struck Uncle Leto. Until one day, in 1956, the Tripartite Aggression against Egypt happened. I spent the night at Uncle Leto's place. And suddenly, there was an air-raid. The sounds of the planes was terrifying. Uncle Leto said, he forgot to turn off the light at the pigeon house on the roof. Minutes later, we heard a loud thud. I was worried about my uncle. It was the first time I saw the sky during a raid. Uncle Leto held the flashlight up. He was giving signs to the enemy planes. Don't ever tell anyone what you just saw. It was the first time I saw fear in his eyes. Because if anything happened to me, you will never see Touna again. A few days later, the government started arresting Jewish people. And I found out what Uncle Leto was doing on the roof that night. He was giving signals to enemy planes. Uncle Leto was sweeter than my own Dad. But, he was a traitor, colluding with the Jews who invaded Palestine. It was the biggest conspiracy... Sadly, I couldn't turn him in. Touna would never forgive me. But if he died... My father said, we have to pay for every sin we commit. Even if we apologize. Whenever we make a mistake, we have to pay the price. Even if we apologize. My, my, Hussein, if you were a little older, I would let you marry Touna. Touna is like a sister of mine, Khawaja. (Khawaja = Master) What's with calling me Khawaja in the past couple of days? Stop that. Don't they want to kick us out of the country? Don't say that again. Am I not like a father to you? My father said: Never be a traitor, even for someone you love. You're even more dear, Uncle. I had a dream about you yesterday. Did you, Hussein? What was the dream? I dreamed that you went on a faraway trip with my late father. He took you by the hand, and you walked with him. A month later, Uncle Leto got really sick. What happened to the cat happened to him. The ambulance came and took him away. And Touna was gone. She went to Israel with the Jews that migrated after the 1956 war. A Leave-with-no-return stamp on her passport. Months later, I found out through letters... that Uncle Leto died. And even though it was a perfect crime, something made me keep the diamond dust. Wait just a minute! He's right there. I applied to the Naval Academy, and was rejected... because of nepotism. I didn't turn out to be a hero like Abdel Nasser. And my father's dream ended. I studied history at the Faculty of Humanities. And as if fate didn't want to destroy my father's dream, and despite nepotism, I was called in to serve in the military. Ready. And the 1967 war with Israel broke out. Sinai was taken over in 6 days. That year, Touna was a nurse in the Israeli army. Against the country she was born. I've decided to resign, the people say no. I returned to the Jewish quarter... on foot from Sinai. And Abdel Nasser died. And with his death, the dreams of an entire generation died as well. He didn't see our victory in 1973. After the peace treaty with Israel, Touna came to visit as part of a delegation. A visit that was 22 years late. In our whole lives, we only fall in love once. - Goodbye. - The rest of our lives, we just recall memories of that love. That was the last time we saw each other. And Touna walked away... without knowing... that I was behind her father's death. After the treaty, I worked as a history teacher. And I married Nahid, my neighbor. I went to the gulf, in a sea of others like me. We came back with the money we made there. But, we left our hearts there. Until Taha came. The most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life. Then, I decided to live in Egypt. I put all my hard earned money in investment companies. We believed them. And our lives were stolen from us. A few months after that, I had a surgery on my back. I got out of that surgery paralyzed from the waist down. An unintended surgical error. Of course, I got no compensation. The only thing I could do was giving private lessons. To put food on the table. And the only thing I did for fun was spying on people. Watching a country slowly drown. What are these binoculars for? My wife, Nahid couldn't take it. There was only me and Taha left in the house. I raised him until he became a man. He became my whole world. He's the only one who tolerated me. But, the old monster inside of me... decided to emerge. I had borne the consequences and sins of the rulers of this country. Killing Leto was the start. Diamond dust is the golden opportunity... to expiate the sins of those with dead conscience. Everyone knew how corrupt the author Mosa Atiia was. A serpent of the rulers. Twisted the facts. To bury the poor in mud. But, who would suspect a man in a wheelchair? The one who sowed cancer in his own children's veins... to reap it one day. Helmi Ashosh was the first. The king of hazardous foods. RIP Helmi Ashosh And Suleiman, my best friend my whole life... who opened his shop with blood money. He waited for the poisons every Sunday... from a black car with black tinted windows... that the devil himself drove. Counseling could do nothing to a dead heart. We'll meet at the doorstep of hell, my friend. And as for Mahrous Birgass, the oldest senator in the parliament, the architect of the legislation that protected those in power, and crushed regular people, he'll be judged by my constitution, one he can't mess with. You'll get a taste of your own medicine, then die, according to my law. Hussein Dahar, the humble layman, who was denied his right to live. I had a dream about you in a bedroom. A friend of mine walked in. He took you by the hand, and you two went out. And now, it's time for an even dirtier snake... that I see with my own eyes for the very first time. But, his story is worth being buried between my eyelids. So my eyes could see it before I go to sleep. And so, it brings me joy... when I wake up everyday. Sarah? Did I wake you up? What time is it? It's 7 pm. Any news? No. Well, what are you doing right now? You know, I'm just up. Come in, please. No, I want to take you somewhere really nice. No, I really can't. Don't be silly. Come on, let's go. Do you miss playing drums? I haven't been able to play since the incident. You're doing everyone in the building a favor. Let me introduce you to Sharif. But seriously, Sharif. Good job on the episode and the whole show. But, I still miss... Sharif the protestor, the guy who stood in the square. It's all staged, my friend. Every player will one day be a coach. - Hi. - Hi. This is the neighbor I told you about. - Sharif Murad, of course. - Good evening. Good evening. I'm so sorry for your loss. May he rest in peace! If you'll excuse me everyone. Come with me. What do you do for a living? I'm a pharmacist. Would you like to have a drink? Can I have a cup of tea? I meant a cold drink. Sadly, they don't have tea here. - Did you find out who...? - No, actually. There isn't any progress. Of course, you're not VIP. If the case was brought to light, the media would have a field day. They love covering funerals. - Right. - But other than that, things will go as usual. Sadly. I've talked a lot about this issue, but all go in vain. No-one wants to pay attention. They're too busy with other things. Waking up, transportation, congestion, going back home, sleeping, waking up early, transportation, congestion, sleeping, waking up, sleeping, waking up. And it goes on. I'm thinking we should do an episode with Taha. That's a great idea. If you helped me, I can help you. We could put a spotlight on... the apathy towards crimes against ordinary citizens. No, no, no. I have nothing to say. No problem, that's Sarah's job. Can you make me a file? - We should shoot in the crime scene. - Please, Mr. Sharif, that won't do. I really have nothing of value to add. I'm sorry, I know this is a really not the right time. Forgive me. Stay strong, Taha. I'll leave you be. but I want you to be certain of something... No matter how many years, no right is lost. Thank you. Enjoy the party. - Nice to meet you. - Goodbye. What do you think of Sharif? A polite fellow. He's very cultured, and cares about what's right. He's so different from everyone around him. Are you... into him? And who isn't into Sharif Murad? I mean, in love with him. If you'll excuse me Sarah, I got to go. Thank you. Did he go? The poor thing! I feel bad for him. One time, I was so mean to him at the pharmacy. Why? Was he trying to flirt? Not too much. But after what happened, I feel like he's all alone. He has no one in the world. And the building is terrifying now. It's heart-wrenching. You have a big heart. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. He'll be fine. He'll be fine. I've been waiting for you. Make one sound, and your blood will splatter all over the floor. You'll die just like your old man. You think I killed your father? I got it wrong. I got it wrong! And do you see it straight now? - I wanted to talk to you. - What? I wanted to talk to you! I had a dream about you. My, my dreams come true just like my dad's. It's life and death. What did you see in your dream? Let's just have some tea first. Would you like some tea? Mr. Waleed? Give me some good news. I have a feeling... that this call is about someone I have here. Is there anything that happens in this country slip past you? Congratulations! The convention is a great success, Dr. Boushra. Yes, sir? Where's Kareem, the boy from the Duqq flat? In a cell alone like you ordered. - Go get him. - Yes, sir. - You have a boy called... - Called Kareem. Are you still a pimp, Boush Boush? Who is this boy for? VIP. I don't think you'd want to upset him. - What happened? - Nothing. A bad smell was coming from the apartment. I went to check. A naughty boy opened the door. I smelled herbs. I searched the apartment... and found five young men dressed like baby dolls. But to be honest with you, Kareem was the best looking baby doll. I brought him here, and he wouldn't talk. He just wrote your number on a piece of paper. I'll hand you a network or big names. And who's in it, Boush Boush? Birgass... Junior. You and Hani Birgass... and who else? How much sugar do you want? A ton. So, what did you dream? I dreamed that my late father... took you by the hand... and you two went together. Your father was a madman. You better pray I don't see you again. Hello? Hello, Mr. Hani. Mr. Hani. You must be Waleed Sultan. You look exactly like I imagined you. - It's an honor to meet you. - Please, have a seat. Wine? Wine. One bottle of Golan wine, please. Golan? Is that Israeli or something? Wine and politics are two different things. Tell me, how's Mr. Birgass doing? - I think it's the end. - Oh, Lord! The doctors found foreign substances along the esophagus. Something weird that caused him tumors. Tumors? The pain is unbearable. My God! May God heal him! Mr. Birgass carried a big responsibility... for so many years. That's exactly what I want to talk to you about. Father's health condition has changed all our plans. If his previous position... got out of the family, it will cause a lot of problems. That's why I've decided to run for my father's seat... in the next elections. And I need someone I can trust. You're a primary candidate for the position, of course. That's true. But rumors, my dear. And slanders. People are believing it. It's human nature. Sadly, the elections aren't built on the elite. The wine is excellent. Other than wine, what would you like to have? Good. Sit down. You have to do whatever he demands, no matter how weird it is. Even if he asks you to beat him. But not too hard, of course. Whatever happens here stays here. If you say a word out there, I won't be responsible for what might happen. Enjoy. When you're done, there's an envelope for you. Capiche? capiche. Get dressed. Well, about... the mansion that's on the lake, on the other side, how much would it cost nowadays? About 68 million, before the dollar was worth 18 pounds. It'll barely be enough... for administrative expenses, shutting up objectors, getting competitors out of the way, throwing a small party, for the sake of Kareem getting out of jail, don't you think? He's really pretty, that Kareem. Why do you want this to be a direct order from high up? Before 2011, that might've happened. Right now, it's better than 2011. Oh, really? Seems, there are some bad rumors spreading around high up. Or do they not approve of your candidacy? Mr. Hani. Trust me, I'm being very transparent. This mansion is anything but a small gift... in exchange for a big favor. Don't you think? I'm going home. - Good evening. - Good evening. How are you? I'm well, and you? Where's Kareem? Kareem is in trouble, I'm trying to get him out of it. Your problem, Boushra, is that you're getting old. Tightening, suctions, conventions, and charity work, you forgot yourself. You forgot who you're dealing with. It's a mistake, it'll never happen again. I promise you, he'll get out. It's just a matter of time. I checked on him. He's fine, he's eating well. It's over. I've already stepped in. There is a gift for you inside. A very lovely gift. Good night. Do you like music? Of course. What do you listen to? I listen to... all kinds of music. But, I love waltz. Waltz. And I can dance too. - You dance? - Yes. Do you dance? You can teach me. Come in. The Department of Inspection and Control Waleed Aroof Gamal Aldeen Sultan. Is that correct? That's correct, sir. You're fluent in French and English. My, my. A highly distinguished family. We need to go over some data together. You sir have a villa, a restaurant, an import company, and a chalet in Hurghada. If you'll excuse me, sir, we're here about the boy whose throat was slit. The boy thing is no big deal. We've identified who did it and arrested him. You're here today... because you asked for a sexual bribe... from the wife of one of your colleagues... in exchange for moving him to Upper Egypt. No, that never happened, sir. I don't know anything about this. Let him hear it. I don't know what you're so worried about. Your husband will take an hour to get back from Cairo. We'll relax, chill, talk, get away from stress. We owe it to ourselves. Do you know how long has it been since I've gotten a massage? Like 6 months. And you'll be back by 9... before he comes. But, I'm scared. Hazem is insane. Don't you have courses you spend like 7 hours in? Consider it a course, whatever. Madam Angie... is just a friend. By the way, the department taps in phone calls continuously. Regularly. You know very well what you said. We summoned Mrs. Angie, and questioned her. And she admitted that you pursued her. And that you indeed asked her for sex as a bribe. What you did Colonel... is a shame on your history and experience. You've really let yourself down. And not just you... but also your colleagues, and the whole department. You're well aware, A bad deed is felt by everyone, but a good deed is felt by a few. Colonel, you're suspended, starting today. You're bound by a home order until we decide on your case. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean-- - What're you doing? Please, stop! Help! Help me! Help me! A month later. Sarah, check out this tweet. A psychopath isn't someone who lies in cold blood, it's someone who does that while also smiling at you. I'm talking about Sharif Murad. #hypocrite. Look who wrote it. The bastard forgot when he begged me for work. I swear he won't get any sleep tonight. Listen. I was thinking, after the convention, we could have two more days off, just to ourselves. As what? I'm waiting for an answer. As my girlfriend. Then we'll have two separate rooms. And don't stay so late or people would notice. - Why don't we get married? - This again, Sarah? Look. The last picture the bitch sent. Her psychiatrist says, she can't take another shock. After her mom and I got divorced. Her grades became terrible. Sharif. Kids get used to things before adults do. And your daughter is older now. She's about to say: Dad, I love you. I thought you were smarter than this. Don't think I actually care about being married. I care about my reputation. People have noticed. And what if we break up? There are things we need to consider. This kind of decision isn't easy right now. Are you afraid that people will say, you married a woman younger than your ex? Or do you love the single life? Mm. Is anyone making you jealous? - No woman can make me jealous. - Right, right. But I feel like you want to keep me in secret. I want you in front of the whole world. But, can I spend the entire honeymoon picking up Rogoums calls? You're still my love, my woman, my little boss, my partner. Where were we? A divorce after 17 years of marriage is an achievement. I love you. I love you too. Hani Birgass to follow the footsteps of a senator in office for 70 years... Rest In peace, Mahrous Birgass. Why are you here? I need your help. What's wrong? I'm dying, Mr. Waleed. Do you want money? No, I don't want money. I want you to get me out of the country. And who's going to take you in looking like that? Why do you want to leave the country? I have many enemies here. They will kill me if they find me. I want to disappear while I'm still standing. I don't want people to see me like this. Why don't you go to a hospital? I went, but nothing they could do. I can barely stand up. Sit. My body is bleeding. Doctors found a foreign substance in my body. - They’re causing-- - Tumors along the esophagus. - Yeah. - Okay. The parliament 1, 2, 3... Don't worry. Besides, I've made this episode. No. Rest assured. The questions are smart. Um... Why are you so surprised? I was deprived. I didn't know what to do... after I divorced her. It's a past I don't like to remember. I had old scores to settle, and I needed to protect myself. I'm seeing a psychiatrist to get therapy. I didn't want to tell you. Therapy? Therapy when you have an archive? You're sick. How many women did you film on this bed? I wouldn't believe you did this if I didn't see it with my own eyes. Do you have tapes of me too? No, Sarah. You're not like them. I love you. I used to think, your wife was crazy. Even if she was, she had every right. She didn't expose you for her daughter's sake. Sarah I'm mentally ill, I'm going to therapy. Stop lying. I've wasted 4 years of my life with you. I believed everything you told me. I tolerated the way people looked at me. And accepted our age difference. I accepted everything. I accepted your problems, your ex, your daughter, your gross mess... Don't play the victim. You knew I was still married, but you still slept with me. Don't forget your sins. I slept with you because I loved you. And because I believed you. I thought you were a respectable man, and a revolutionary hero. - Come on. - So did many other people. But when they see your tapes, they won't believe you anymore. - Sarah. - When they see... the respectable man, who preaches about... principals, and freedom, and human rights, what will they say? - What are you...? - I will expose you. I will expose you, Sharif Murad. I'm going to expose you. Let go of me! - Come back here! - Ow! Ow! Ow! Sirvis! Go get us some tea. How much sugar do you like? I remember, not too sweet. Go. Go now! You know, when I was looking around the place, I found something very weird. Check out this surprise. I won't be part of this world. I will open the gates of hell myself. Even if you cut off my head, killing can become a side effect... of a medicine that cures a dying nation. You can't imagine. We've lost a hero. You know, your dad had served the country more than I did? Sirvis is sadly dying. And he found out the secret behind his death in that book. Diamond dust. I apologize, I forgot. - Let me. - Ow! That animal... killed my father. Because I called the police on him after he came to the pharmacy. No, Taha. It's a lot bigger than a fight between you and Sirvis. Thank you. What're you doing? What're you doing? You know, Sirvis? This is the first time I see someone avenging their own death beforehand. Sorry, sorry, Taha. It's alright, it's over. Calm down. Is he dead? Sirvis is a very important species. He's like a link between... the upper and the under worlds. He is someone that does your dirty work for you. Closes the open sewers, gets a cockroach to make you puke. But if you need him for something, you have to tolerate his stench. You know what's dumb? It's to ask a creature like this... to design your apartment interior, for example. On New Year's Eve, your father was sitting in this exact place, entertaining himself. That's normal. You can't help being curious. Okay. But the lights must be off. Until one day, he turned the light on. Turn it off, Taha. I turned it on. It's not your fault, Taha. It's not your fault that your dad saw something he shouldn't have. Then Sirvis got ordered to shut up your dad. He didn't come for you, by the way. But you being there at the same time, that was unfortunate. What did my dad see exactly? Your late father... saw Hani Birgass in that window... with a guy friend of his... playing bride and groom. And Hani was the bride. How did you... find out all of this? Sirvis asked me to get him abroad. I said it's really difficult. He opened up to me, and told me the exact same symptoms... Mahrous Birgass suffered from. Tumors along the esophagus, foreign substances. And you told me about a strange visit to Birgass... before your late father died. And don't forget, the Lord shop guy died of the same symptoms. The dots are starting to connect. There's a pattern. With the diaries of your late father, the picture becomes clear. Mahrous Birgass, Suleiman Lord, the writer Mossa Attia, and the Jewish jeweler. May God have mercy on your father's soul. He was a judge and an executioner since he was 12 years old. May God have mercy. Did you and Sirvis come here to kill me? If that were true, you would've been dead already. Then sir, why did come? I came to protect you, Taha. Because the same person... who ordered... your father to be killed... is the same person... that hurt me. And was the reason... for my dismissal. Do you know who that is? Who? Hani Birgass. Sometimes, killing is merciful. Get up. Sit in my place. Sit down, Taha. Sit down. Get closer. Look at me, Taha. Smile. What's wrong? Isn't this what you wanted? Smile. There you go. We can't continue our conversation while you're in this state. And what am I supposed to do with this? Well. I'm sure you'll know what to do. You're a pharmacist. Bye. Sharif Murad: Pick up, I'm downstairs. Who's there? Open up. - Sarah? - Yes. Who did this to you? Can I please come in? Come in, quickly, come in. Come in, come this way. Sharif hit me. Sharif Murad? Why did he hit you? Did he... just hit you? I want to file a case. Sharif Murad is a big name. You're not VIP. And I'm sure he has... a lot of lawyers. And higher ups he can talk to at any time. The law won't protect you. You were... at his place. We need to... calm down, so we can think things through. Let me change the ice. Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shut up. Calm down, calm down. Nobody knows, nobody knows. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm going to remove my my hands. Don't yell, okay? What are you? What exactly are you? I am... Taha Hussein Dahar. How could you manage to live through all this? I've never had a say over how I should live my life. Is your mom dead? My mother died twice. Once, 15 years ago, when she left me and got married, after my dad got paralyzed. She lived to the age of 40. The second time was a year ago. She died of cancer. You didn't talk to your mom for 15 years? Yeah, but when she called me, I'd pick up the phone, but I wouldn’t say anything. Does someone who left me have the right to ask if I'm okay? Do you think after what you've discovered... that you wronged her? Maybe. But she also left me. And what about your dad? "Dad" is the weirdest word I hear right now. I swear, if I see him right now, I don't know what I'd do. Did you know he was married? What made you stand by him? - Why were you with him? - I loved him. I loved him. This will relax you a bit, and get you to sleep. What're you going to do with that body? Good morning. Say, where's your father's grave? Imam graveyard. Alright, let's meet there at 3 to pray for his soul. Bye. You did not disappoint me. Is that Sirvis? Old Hussein raised you well. What do you want from me? Trust. We must stand by each other, Taha, during this difficult time. Should I trust a murderer? Hey, if I let Sirvis go to you on his own, you would've been in this body-bag. We're here to help your father get comfortable in his grave, Taha. We got his killer to him to relieve him. I've done my part. Now, it's your turn to return the favor. What favor? We need to get rid of the one who hurt all of us. Hani Birgass. Then your father will rest in peace. I'll get my job back. We all live happily. What do you want me to do? I'm not a murderer! You're putting us in danger you can't fathom. Can you really carry on living... knowing the man who killed your father... is enjoying every minute of his life? - No. - Then start digging. Dig. When your father wrote these diaries, he wrote them for you. Get it through your head, Taha. Cleaning society of its filth requires sacrifice, and a lot of it. You know what you're doing... is not just your revenge but also the revenge of the poor. God is wise. He picked you and your father out of millions of people on this earth... to execute his will, to be the law. Until we actually have a real law. How am I going to do that? There's a natural killer inside all of us. The smart guy knows when to let it out. When it's needed. When it's right. Leave the details to me. But the means is... to avenge your father. And if I refuse? I'll see you later, Taha. We'll talk again. I missed you Boush Boush. Believe me, this is not personal at all. When I sat down and thought it through, I concluded that, anyone in your shoes would've done the same thing. I killed your winning horse... that got you a link with Hani Birgass. Of course, you'd try to frame me. And of course, it had to be a sexual charge... because it was by you. If you knew the truth, you'd know I'm blameless. I warned you. That's why I'm here. I want to clarify some points you might have missed. Listen, Boushra. To tell you straight, sorry but, you're not young anymore. So your connections are over. Especially, to a public figure like Hani Birgass. A figure who wants their dirty secrets to stay under the rug, and never get out. By the way, if Hani felt the slightest threat, he wouldn't hesitate to get rid of you in an instant. And to be honest with you, I don't want to be the reason for someone else's death. We have common interests. And what do you want from me? An appointment with Hani Birgass. You've clearly lost your marbles. You're right, Boushra. These days, I really do feel like I'm seeing weird visions. Sometimes, I see newspaper headlines... that read: The dead of Mrs. Boushra Seer. Her body was found in her luxurious apartment. The body was swollen. And after performing an autopsy, we found evidence of rape. Stop it, stop it, stop it! I really have visions like these, Boushra. Okay. I'll get you an appointment. I was sure you wouldn't let me down, Boushra. Taha? I miss you so much, my dear. You haven't visited me in a while. What's wrong, Taha? Do you remember Leto, Grandad's friend? How do you know about Leto? Your dad never mentioned him. I'll tell you a little story. Once, there was a man named Noah. He used to live in a country. The people in it had forgotten the Lord. He got up every morning, and would talk to them, trying to guide them. The people didn't listen, and no one showed interest. So one day he said, only blood would work on these people. Kill the masters to fix the condition of the servants. Instead of them having children... that would grow up to be just as bad as them, everyday, he would kill someone, until he got rid of all the filth in the neighborhood. With every soul he took, his heart would die a little. At the end, his heart completely died. He committed an awful sin, and he thought he was doing good. Until one day, all the people gathered against him, people who used to listen to him. They used his own judgment on him. And they killed him. And they were at ease. And the neighborhood was at ease. Your father, Taha, never hid anything from me. Because I was his mother and sister. Just as I am your mother. But, he was hiding things from me. What do you want me to tell you, dear? Your dad loved you so much, son. You were everything to him. He never wanted you to enter his world, so you wouldn't see what he saw. Go. Go rest till daybreak. Do ablution and pray, my dear. Tell God everything that's on your mind, He will listen to you. Don't rush to find the answer. You're invited tomorrow by Hani Birgass. There will be a friend of mine waiting for you there from 10 o'clock. But this time, it's not in the mansion. It's at this address. You'll enter there with respect. And do what you have to do, and then leave. Give them any excuse, like having diarrhea, anything. Hopefully, we will hear some good news in a month. You talk like I kill people everyday like it's nothing. I was exactly like you when I killed the first criminal. But, don't worry. You'll think differently in the future. Especially, when you believe you're killing for justice. We are not criminals, Taha. We are vigil justice... with eyes wide open. Are you going to do what he wants? You are selling your soul. I didn't sell anything, Sarah. I didn't sell anything. My soul was stolen from me. What if someone was behind Hani Birgass? I don't care what happens then. I can't let my dad die in vein. Your dad got nothing out of the people he killed. Those people were buried with popular funerals. And they were even honored. But your dad, he was murdered... and forgotten. Nobody came to his funeral. Say that when you are in my position, Sarah. Wouldn’t you want to do that to Sharif Murad? But then, I wouldn't be me. I would be someone else. He'll make you do what you did to Sirvis. Nothing is guaranteed, Sarah. Nothing is up to me. My soul is in the hands of Waleed Sultan. Whatever happens here, it must stay here. You have never seen me, nor do you know me, nor will you see me if we meet by coincidence anywhere. Capiche? - Good evening. - Good evening. - How are you? - I'm fine, and you? I'm fine. I got you a pretty gift. Do you like music? Yeah, I play the drums. Wow! Drums? The nerves of steel. Do you know the scent of the body is very important ? I can tell the personality by its smell. You, for example. For a long time, since you were young, you can't find someone to understand you. Yes. When I was young. I'll take a shower, and be back. Turn it off, Taha! And now, it's time for an even dirtier snake... that I see with my own eyes for the very first time. But, his story is worth being buried between my eyelids. So my eyes could see it before I go to sleep. And so, it brings me joy when I wake up everyday. So my eyes could see it before I go to sleep. And so, it brings me joy when I wake up everyday. So my eyes could see it before I go to sleep. And so, it brings me joy when I wake up everyday. The book of hell. If you are reading my diaries, Taha, that means, I've been dead. When the car stopped in front of Lord's shop, I thought I was gonna witness the end of Suleiman. But, I was wrong. There's another snake... whose poison is even deadlier. Waleed Sultan. He was the one selling the poison to the merchant. The one to catch criminals but is a criminal himself. Who would suspect, or would inspect the car of the main inspector? My mind wandered for a few seconds, so I did not notice Taha.. before he turned on the light. Sometimes, the end comes at the hands... of the most beloved person... Taha. Okay, I have to go. I knew what was going to happen. Waleed Sultan will send... someone to kill me. Someone to free me from my body. I will wait for him, and open my door. I will mock him. I'll provoke him until he kills me, and free me from my eternal prison. I cannot bear this world anymore. I was afraid I would die at the hands of an honorable man. Then I would have doubted everything I had ever done. I welcome death at the hands of someone vile like you. Forgive me, Taha. Dad? Dad! Hey, where are you? Why didn't you answer my calls? There was a problem. Meet me at the cemetery. Is there no other place but my father's grave? I'll send you the location where we will meet. It's a coffee shop. How are you doing? Is he still trying to get to you? I asked my lawyer. He said, because I was at his place, the case is in his favor. I thought about calling all the women I saw on his tapes. Then I remembered his daughter. And his wife is a very nice and respectable woman. I feel like... the world closes all it's doors in my face. I just want to sleep. Do you want to say something? I came here to tell you that I'm going to disappear for a while. Why? I found my dad's legacy. No, Taha. How can you leave me like this? Taha! I will not forgive you if anything happens to you. Take care of yourself. - What is it? - Good evening. Would you like something to drink? Later. Speak. Everything was going as planned. Mm. Until I... I saw this picture. And what's wrong with this picture? - Read the date. - January first, 2018. New Year's eve. The same night my father saw Hani Birgass... with his "friend" as you call him. I still don't know what you are trying to get at. Get me a cup of tea. Hani Birgass was celebrating New Year's Eve in France. Not at his dad's house. Maybe, he saw him any other day. He never saw him at all. Taha, I don't have a lot of time or patience, and I hate crowds. Just spit it out. I'm going to the bathroom. Sit down. Are you trying to fool Waleed Sultan? I found these diaries yesterday. The last thing my father wrote before he died. More deadly, Waleed Sultan is the one selling the poison... God bless his soul. It was really disrespectful. How could he write that about me? And you believe this old man’s nonsense? My father killed, but he never lied. Okay. "And he who killed shall be killed." Isn't that right? And by the way, I saved your father from a lot of humiliation. Imagine what would happen? He would be despised. The diary would be exposed. The newspapers would published it. The families of the victims would find out. Should he be executed at that age? And with good cause? And you, how would you get along with people? You would have lived as the son of a murderer. No travel, no passport. You would have to migrate because you would get all kinds of threats. You killed my dad because he saw you? If your dad had lived, he would have killed me. Shouldn't I protect myself? Don't let your love for your father blind you. And as for the brief case from Suleiman Lord every week, he got me the good stuff. Everything was going smoothly, then... it was the inspector curiosity. I made the mistake. I lowered the window, and saw your old man. Lord told me all about him. He was going to visit him. He didn't know that he was poisoned two weeks earlier. So, you sent Sirvis? Sometimes, we would make small mistakes, so we could fix a bigger one. Oh, by the way, remind me to send you your picture with Sirvis. Who took that picture? And where's the body anyway? By the way, I won't stay silent, even in death. In the jungle, the pride lions don't die. If one kills another, the family would welcome the new leader. Sometimes, a cub grows up and revenges his father. But, you know what the law on the jungle says? The stronger lives. The new pride lion kills the cubs of the dead lion. The cub and all his siblings... before mating with their mother. A month later. I bet, you were smart enough to come back to me. And you won the bet. Stay with me. This episode is very important. Without sugar. You wouldn't believe how the past days have been. I want to invite you to dinner after this episode. To make it up to you. People, I am optimistic. I am seriously optimistic. Believe me. This nation has proven... that it has a strong will, that it can sort out traitors. What's wrong with your voice? It doesn't sound good. - Drink anise. - The nation is better off now. The home plane... will fly faster... when we throw out the liars and traitors. After the break, we'll have a very important guest, Deputy... Hani Birgass. He had to die. So, he wouldn’t hurt anyone else. My relationship with Sarah got stronger. We had nothing to hide from each other. I don't know. Is the tragedy the reason? Or is it love? We agreed to bury the past, and never look back. The entire Egyptian and Arabic news media had lost, with the death Sharif Murad, one of its greatest producers. Silence is a crime. People who live underneath... must keep an eye out for those up above. I promised her that I wouldn't be like my father. But, I am no longer the same Taha that I've known. And she is no longer the same Sarah that I've known. For killing... has its side effects. Cruelty. That was necessary. So that, history wouldn't forget every corrupt person... that deserved the diamond dust. And the question remains. Will we ever forget what happened? Or will be tormented... by guilt forever?
