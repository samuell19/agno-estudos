BYE. - OH, HELLO, VERA. - OH, HI. - THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN - A SPEECH AND A PRESENTATION. - ALL RIGHT? - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - OH, YOU'RE MOST VERY WELCOME. ALL RIGHT. - THANK YOU. - TA-TA. GOOD LUCK. - OKAY, BYE. - I'M GRANT MARSHALL, THANKS FOR WATCHING. WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. - HEY, WHAT'S UP? YOU DIDN'T SEEM LIKE YOURSELF TONIGHT. - CAN WE GET UP TO THE ROOF? - HOW IS IT POSSIBLE I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS ANNUAL METEOR SHOWER. - WELL, IT'S LIKE MY DAD, THE PHYSICIST SAYS. THERE'S SO MUCH TO KNOW, YOU CAN'T KNOW IT ALL. - SO YOUR MOM, WAS SHE A SCIENTIST, TOO? - NO, SHE WAS A ARTIST... AND A BIT OF A HIPPIE. - I GUESS THAT'S WHERE YOU GET ME-- NATURE-LOVING SCIENCE NERD. - AND YOU GREW UP HERE IN SAN DIEGO? - BORN AND RAISED. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY PLACE BETTER. - YEAH, IT IS A GREAT LITTLE CITY. - WHAT ABOUT YOU? - OH, GOSH. I'VE BOUNCED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, YOU KNOW. - WHY? - OH, I'VE BEEN WORKING MY WAY UP THE BROADCAST NEWS FOOD CHAIN. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST HOW IT GOES. YOU GET A JOB, YOU BOOST THE RATINGS, THEN YOU MOVE ON. - AND THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE? I DIDN'T MEAN--NO OFFENSE. - NONE TAKEN. I, UM, I HAD A FALL FROM THE NETWORK NEWS LEVEL IN NEW YORK. LONG BORING STORY. - MM. - TELL ME WHY METEOROLOGY. - WELL, WHEN I WAS A KID, I SAW THIS DISPLAY AT THE CHILDREN'S MUSEUM ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE, YOU KNOW, LIKE CLOUDS THE SIZE OF MOUNTAINS, LIGHTNING STORMS, THE AURORA BOREALIS. I MEAN, ALL NATURAL OCCURRENCES. REAL LIFE. BUT... AT THE TIME, IT JUST SEEMED SO... MAGICAL. PROBABLY SEEMS PRETTY SILLY. - NOT AT ALL. - OH. - HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY? - IT'S NOTHING. - TALK TO ME. - THIS JOB'S JUST GETTING ME... NOTICED AT WORK. - THAT'S GREAT. - NO, NOT IN THE WAY THAT I WANT. - OH, THEY'RE JUST JEALOUS. - OR I LOOK FOOLISH. - OKAY, I'M SORRY. STOP. I'VE DIRECTED NETWORK NEWS. I CAN PROMISE YOU... YOU DON'T LOOK FOOLISH. YOU LOOK FANTASTIC. HEY, DO YOU WANT TO-- DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE AND-- I DON'T KNOW, GO GET SOME COFFEE OR SOMETHING? - UH... I CAN'T. I HAVE A PAPER TO WRITE. - OKAY. - YEAH. - HEY. - HI. I THOUGHT YOU WERE WATCHING THE METEOR SHOWER. - I DID, ON THE ROOF OF THE STATION WITH QUENTIN. - STOP, REWIND. - IT WAS JUST STARGAZING, FRAN. - YEAH, I ALWAYS GO ON ROOFS WITH MY BOSS. - HE DID WANT TO GET COFFEE AFTER. - DON'T TELL ME YOU SAID NO. - I PANICKED. I SAID I HAD A PAPER TO WRITE, WHICH I DO. - I KNEW IT. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE PANICKED IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THIS GUY. - AT FIRST I THOUGHT HE WAS TOO SLICK, A PLAYER, BUT NOW I FIND HIM VERY INTERESTING. - HMM. WELL, MAYBE TOMORROW YOU TAKE HIM UP ON THAT COFFEE. SEE WHAT HAPPENS. - SO AS HOT AIR RISES, COLD AIR IS BROUGHT IN FROM THE OCEAN. DO YOU GUYS THINK WE COULD COME UP WITH, LIKE, AN ANIMATION FOR THAT? - YEAH. - COOL. TAKE A CHANCE. - JUST TRY IT ON. IT'S PERFECT, NOT TOO OVER THE TOP. LET ME ADD A LITTLE COLOR TO YOUR EYES. MAYBE LOSE THE GLASSES. - I REALLY DON'T DO PANTSUITS. OKAY. - HEY, WEATHER GIRL. - I'M REALLY BUSY RIGHT NOW, VERA. - I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE TO CONGRATULATE YOU. - FOR? - FOR BECOMING A BIG SHOT ON LOCAL TV NEWS, OF COURSE. HOW VERY BRAVE OF YOU TO PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE LIKE THAT. - THANKS. - OH, AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE NAYSAYERS. THAT GUY MARV ON THE MEDIA-- HE DOESN'T KNOW TALENT WHEN HE SEES IT. - FRANNY! - I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE. - IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING THE BATTLE OF THE LOCAL WEATHER WOMEN, KPPQ AND KQMI ARE CONTINUING THE CATWALK... - OH, LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF. DID WE HIT THE LOTTERY? - HARDLY. BUT IT IS NICE TO HAVE SOME ACTUAL MONEY COMING IN. YOU ABSOLUTELY ROCK. - ARE WE STILL ON FOR OUR SHOOT TOMORROW? - OH. - DON'T TELL ME YOU FORGOT. - NO, NO, NO. JUST--WHAT TIME IS IT AGAIN? I HAVE TO BE AT THE DISC GOLF TOURNAMENT AT 2:00. - OH, IT'S NOT UNTIL 4:00. I'LL MEET YOU THERE. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE US LONG. - OKAY, AND THEN IT'S INTENSE DISSERTATION WRITING FOR ME FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKEND. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF MARV ON THE MEDIA? - YEAH, HE'S JUST SOME ENTERTAINMENT GOSSIP WEASEL. WHY? - SO THIS LOW-PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL CAUSE SOME WIND COMING IN FROM THE WEST. - THAT'S SO WRONG. - I KNOW. WHY DO THEY HAVE A MODEL DOING THE WEATHER? - NO, IT'S A HIGH-PRESSURE SYSTEM. - ALL RIGHT, KFZA HAS MADE A BOLD MOVE BY BRINGING ON RADIO METEOROLOGIST DEB METCALFE, WHO, WITHOUT ADORNMENT, BRINGS US THE WEATHER. WHO CARES IF SHE HAS THE PROVERBIAL FACE FOR RADIO? - OH. DEB, WHATEVER. HE'S JUST SOME SNARKY LITTLE GOSSIP GEEK. - OH, NO. - WHAT? - VERA-- SHE POSTED THE LINK ON THE PACIFICA WEATHER CENTER WEBSITE. I'M PROBABLY THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT NOW. - WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? - PLAY THE GAME. ♪ ♪ HEY, THANKS FOR COMING IN ON A SATURDAY. - ARE YOU KIDDING? I'VE BEEN DYING TO DO THIS. YOU'VE GOT TERRIFIC BONES, AND YOUR HAIR WAS MADE FOR SHAPING. - I STILL WANT TO LOOK LIKE ME. - MM-HMM. ♪ ♪ GET UNDER THERE. BLOW IT UP. YEAH, THAT'S IT. GOOD. LOOK AT YOU. - I THINK WE WENT A LITTLE BEYOND. - THERE'S MORE. JUST TRY IT ON. - OH, COME ON. - TRUST ME. - GOT HERE AS SOON AS I COULD. - SHOT BY AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD WITH A SMARTPHONE. - DO WE HAVE THIS EXCLUSIVE? - WE DO. GRANT JUST G HERE. I ALREADY SENT BILL OUT. I'M TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF DEB, BUT SO FAR-- - DEB? SHE'S HERE. SHE'S BEEN WITH ME IN MAKEUP ALL MORNING. - LOOK AT THAT. - WOW, DEB. LOOK AT YOU. - OKAY, YEAH, THAT'S GOOD. NOW WHAT'S THE NEXT-- - TA-DA. - I HEARD YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME. - YOU LIKE A MILLION BUCKS IN MARKET SHARES. - WHAT DID YOU DO? - THOUGHT I'D TRY SOMETHING NEW. - OH, NO, THAT WAS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. - IS IT A PROBLEM? - NO. NO, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. YOU LOOK GREAT. ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO, A FUNNEL CLOUD THERE, SHOW HER THE CLIP.. - IF IT TOUCHED DOWN, IT'S A TORNADO. WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE IN SAN DIEGO SINCE THE EARLY '90s. - THIS ONE LOOKS PRETTY STRONG. - NO, IT'S ABOUT AN F1 ON THE WEAKER SIDE. - OKAY, WELL, DON'T SAY THAT ON THE AIR UNTIL I TELL YOU. PLAY UP THE WIND, THE FLYING DEBRIS-- THERE'S LOTS OF GREAT FLYING DEBRIS CLIPS HERE. - IS ANYONE HURT? - APPARENTLY NOT, NO. BUT DON'T MENTION THAT EITHER. - PEOPLE WILL WANT TO KNOW. - RIGHT, I KNOW-- WE ALWAYS REVEAL THE DETAILS OF A STORY A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME. YOU NEVER CUT TO THE CHASE. THAT'S JUST HOW WE DO IT. OKAY, COME ON, GUYS. WE GOT TO WRAP THIS UP. WE HAVE TO GO. WHERE ARE WE GOING? - YOU'RE GOING LIVE, BREAKING NEWS. - WE HAVE IT UP RIGHT NOW. - ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO, LET'S GO, PEOPLE. - QUENTIN, WHAT AM I SAYING? - OKAY, SO GRANT'S GONNA LEAD US IN. HE'LL ANNOUNCE THE TORNADO. THEN WE'RE GONNA SHOW THE FOOTAGE THAT WE HAVE. WE'RE JUST GONNA PLAY THAT TORNADO FOOTAGE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, GRANT, OKAY? THEN WE'RE GONNA COME TO YOU. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TALK ABOUT TORNADOES. MAKE IT EXCITING, OKAY? CURTIS, ARE YOU GOOD? - YEAH. - HEY, I'LL BE IN YOUR EAR, ALL RIGHT? WE GOOD? - STANDING BY. - I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE MYSELF. - YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. JUST BE YOU. - CHECK AUDIO. - SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE NOW. SHE LOOKED PERFECT BEFORE. - ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, WE'RE LIVE IN TEN SECONDS. WE'RE GONNA START WITH DEB, WE'RE GONNA GO TO BILL, AND THEN COME BACK TO DEB. NO ONE MENTION THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY INJURIES UNTIL LATER IN THE BROADCAST. - I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. - JUST FOLLOW DIRECTIONS PLEASE. OKAY. HERE WE ARE. IN FIVE, FOUR, THREE. - LIVE FROM THE KFZA NEWSROOM, WE BRING YOU BREAKING NEWS WITH GRANT MARSHALL. - MORNING, FRIENDS. HERE'S THE LATEST. A TORNADO HAS TOUCHED DOWN IN SAN DIEGO. LET'S GO TO KFZA METEOROLOGIST DEB METCALFE. DEB, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? - THIS IS DEB METCALFE IN THE KFZA NEWSROOM. - YOU SHOULD THINK, AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN HERE. ANYWAY, NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE. I'M HERE. I HEARD THERE'S A TORNADO. I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT NEED--HELLO. - THERE HASN'T BEEN A TORNADO IN SAN DIEGO SINCE 1992. - IT'S A VERY RARE AND DANGEROUS EVENT. - FORTUNATELY, AT THIS TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF INJURY. - GO LIVE TO BILL. - IS THAT OUR DEB METCALFE? - SHE LOOKS UNCOMFORTABLE, DON'T YOU THINK? - ON THE CONTRARY, SHE LOOKS RATHER GOOD. - WHERE WITNESSES DESCRIBED IT AS 15 SECONDS OF SHEER TERROR. TOPPLING TREES AND HURDLING DEBRIS, THIS TORNADO REALLY TOOK SAN DIEGO BY SURPRISE. - TORNADOES ARE RARE IN OUR REGION, AND AS IS USUALLY THE CASE FOLLOWING A TORNADO, WE WILL BE LOOKING AT CLEAR SKIES. IN FACT, I'M HEADED TO THE PALOMAR DISC GOLF COURSE FOR THE CHILDREN'S MUSEUM FUND-RAISER FOLLOWING THIS BROADCAST. - TELL THEM TO WATCH AT 6:00. - JOIN THE WEEKEND TEAM FOR MORE ON THIS STORY. FOR KFZA NEWS, THIS IS DEB METCALFE. WE'LL KEEP YOU INFORMED THROUGHOUT THE DAY. - HEY, YOU UNDERSTAND THE BASIC DIVISION OF LABOR HERE, RIGHT? - IS THIS ABOUT THE LACK OF CASUALTIES? - WAS MY DIRECTION NOT CLEAR ENOUGH? - PEOPLE WANNA KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. - WELL, WE COULD HAVE STRETCHED THAT SEGMENT FOR 20 MINUTES. - I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T ONE TO EXPLOIT THE SITUATION. - THIS WAS A TORNADO IN SAN DIEGO. LIKE, THAT'S POTENTIAL FOR A GREAT STORY, A REAL STORY. - SO IF THIS ISN'T WORKING OUT, THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO REPLACING ME. - I CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN. - YOU GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO. UGH, COME ON. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. - CAR TROUBLE? - FLOODED. SHE'LL START AGAIN IN A HALF HOUR, BUT THEN I'LL BE LATE. - WHERE DID YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING? - FUND-RAISER FOR THE CHILDREN'S MUSEUM. - I CAN DRIVE YOU. - I THOUGHT YOU WERE ANGRY. - NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT ANGRY. I'M NOT ANGRY. I JUST GET--I GET VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT MY JOB. LOOK, I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT. I JUST DIDN'T THINK YOU NEEDED TO CHANGE. YOU HAVE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL ABOUT YOU. OKAY, COME ON, LET ME-- LET ME GIVE YOU A RIDE. BESIDES, IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD CAUSE. - YOU KNOW HOW TO THROW A FRISBEE? - PALOMAR MOUNTAIN'S BEAUTIFUL, HUH? - PHEW, WHAT A DAY TOO. THIS IS SPECTACULAR. - OH, EXCUSE ME. HI. - TWO. - YOU EXCITED? - I AM. I'M CURIOUS, BUT I AM. - THANK YOU. - WHAT DO I DO WITH THESE? - THIS IS DISC GOLF. - DISC GOLF, HUH? - FOLLOW ME. - OH, MAN. - HERE YOU GO. - EXCUSE ME. SORRY, YOU'RE DEB METCALFE, RIGHT? - UH, I AM, YES. - MY WIFE WAS REALLY FREAKING OUT ABOUT THAT TORNADO AND FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALL THE NEWSCASTS, WHICH, YOU KNOW, WERE REALLY HYPING THE SO-CALLED DANGER. YOUR HONEST REPORT REALLY CALMED HER DOWN. WE'RE BOTH VERY APPRECIATIVE. - THAT'S SO NICE TO HEAR. - AND I GOTTA SAY, I LOVE THE NEW LOOK. THANKS. - I'M SAL. - DEB. - NICE TO MEET YOU. - QUENTIN. WHERE'S THE BASKET? - IT IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER THERE. - SO IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WRIST. YOU JUST HAVE TO FLIP THE WRIST TO RELEASE IT LEVEL. IT'LL GO IN. YOU GOTTA TRUST. - THAT'S DEEP. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. LEVEL RELEASE, ALL IN THE WRIST. - YUP. - THAT WAS EMBARRASSING BUT FUN. - WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY DO FOR FUN? - I GENERALLY JUST WORK AND EAT. - REALLY? - NO, I-- - THAT'S-- - WHAT? - SAD. - YEAH? I'VE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY. - THANKS. - THANK YOU. I JUST DO WHAT I NEED TO DO TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD. BESIDES, I NEVER REALLY HAD A REASON TO SETTLE DOWN. - OH, THERE'S FRAN. HEY. - WHOA. I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE YOU. - I GOT A NEW HAIRSTYLE. - YOU GOT A NEW HEAD. UH, HEY, THIS IS QUENTIN. - QUENTIN? - THE FAMOUS DOCUMENTARIAN, I PRESUME. - CAN YOU WRITE A NOTE TO MY MOM THAT SAYS THAT? - WHAT IS YOUR DOCUMENTARY ABOUT? - IT FOCUSES ON THE CURRENT DROUGHT AND THE LOOMING WATER CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING HERE IN THE SOUTHWEST. - WOW. - I WANNA GET A SHOT OF YOU IN FRONT OF THE DISPLAY, SO YOU CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THE WATERSHEDS. - COOL. - OKAY. I HAVE TO GO AND GET A BOUNCE CARD. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. - SO WAIT--SO ARE YOU ACTUALLY IN FRAN'S DOCUMENTARY? - YEAH. WHY? - WELL, THE CONTRACT WE HAVE WITH YOU IS EXCLUSIVE, SO YOU'RE NOT-- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO ANY OTHER KIND OF OUTSIDE MEDIA WORK. - OH, I DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF THAT. - I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD REALLY CARE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS, BUT JUST KEEP IT UNDER WRAPS. - NOTED. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STICK AROUND, YOU KNOW. - I'D KIND OF LIKE TO STAY AND WATCH YOU WORK, IF YOU DON'T MIND. - SURE. - IT'S NICE OF YOU TO HELP FRAN WITH HER DOC. - THAT PROJECT MEANS EVERYTHING TO HER. THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR. - STILL, I MEAN... I KNOW HOW BUSY YOU ARE. - WITH EVERYTHING I HAVE TO DO AT THE STATION AND THE UNIVERSITY, THIS IS THE CLOSEST I'VE GOTTEN TO EATING OUT. - IT'S NICE TO GET OUT, THOUGH. - WE NEED TO ORGANIZE A TOUR OF SAN DIEGO FOR YOU. - MM-HMM. YES. ABSOLUTELY. I'M ALL FOR THAT. NO, SERIOUSLY, I'VE HAD NO CHANCE TO EXPLORE AT ALL. EVERY CITY I'VE EVER LIVED IN, I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE REALLY GOTTEN A CHANCE TO KNOW THEM. - IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN FIND WHEN YOU SETTLE DOWN. - EXCUSE ME. ARE YOU DEB METCALFE? - YES. - I LOVE YOUR WEATHER BROADCAST. - OH, THANK YOU! HOLY COW! - I'M TELLING YOU, I KNOW YOU THINK OF THIS NEWS GIG AS A PART-TIME THING, BUT YOU COULD BE HUGE. OH, NO WAY! - NO, I'M DEAD SERIOUS. I MEAN, YOU SAW THE WAY THE PEOPLE REACTED TO YOU. JUST THINK ABOUT IT. - I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. LUCKY ME, SHE STARTED. - I WAS KIND OF HOPING IT WOULDN'T. - I HAVE A DISSERTATION TO FINISH. - I HAD A GREAT TIME WITH YOU TODAY. - ME, TOO. - I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. - YEAH, SHE LOOKS GOOD! - HI, DEB. - HI. - SHE LOOKS GREAT. - I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE FINALLY STARTING TO SEE HER POTENTIAL. - OH, SHE'S DIGNIFIED. SMART, REAL CLASS ACT. I THINK SHE COULD BRING BOTH CREDIBILITY AND NOTORIETY TO OUR INSTITUTION. - EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU. - THE WAY I SEE IT, IT'S CERTAINLY BETWEEN HER AND VERA FOR THE FELLOWSHIP. THIS PRESENTATION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WILL GIVE THEM BOTH ONE FINAL CHANCE TO SHOW US WHAT THEY'VE REALLY GOT. - DEB WILL BE READY. - GOOD. - AH, ANY TORNADOS TO REPORT ON TODAY, MS. METCALFE? GOOD MORNING, DR. CRENSHAW, SIR. - GOOD MORNING. PLEASE CALL ME DAVID. JUST CAME BY TO SAY HOW IMPRESSED WE ALL WERE WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE AT THE KFZA NEWS. IT WAS LOVELY. - OH! THANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR--DAVID-- SIR--WAIT. NOT SIR DAVID? - NO. - WELL, ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW YOU THAT WELL. MAYBE YOU HAVE BEEN KNIGHTED. LOVELY. HAVE A GOOD DAY. - SO WHERE ARE YOU WITH YOUR DISSERTATION? - BEHIND. - AND HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR PRESENTATION? - IT'S COMING ALONG. - DEB, YOU'VE COME TOO FAR TO DROP THE BALL. - I KNOW. I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP MY HEAD ABOVE WATER. - YOU HAVE WORKED TOWARD THIS ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITY YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. YOU NEED TO KNOCK THIS COMMITTEE PRESENTATION OUT OF THE PARK. NOW, I CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU GET STARTED WITH THAT IF YOU LIKE. I'M WIDE OPEN THIS AFTERNOON. - I CAN'T. THEY WANT ME AT THE STATION FOR A PROMO SHOOT. - WELL, I WANT A DRAFT OF THAT PRESENTATION SPEECH ON MY DESK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. - THAT'S GOOD. - ONE SEC. - THANK YOU, LADIES. THANK YOU, APRIL. I JUST WANNA GET A FEW WITH GRANT AND DEB ALONE. THANK YOU. - I FEEL SO AWKWARD. WHAT'S YOUR SECRET? - I JUST LOVE HAVING MY PICTURE TAKEN. - THE CAMERA LOVES YOU, TOO, GRANT. - PERFECT. - YEAH, THAT WAS GOOD. I LIKE THAT. - I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TURNED HER INTO A REAL NEWSWOMAN. HER SHORT-TERM AGREEMENT IS SET TO EXPIRE SOON. WE NEED HER TO RESIGN LONG-TERM. - WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO? - YOU SEEM TO HAVE HER... ATTENTION. CONVINCE HER. - HEY, WILLY, WHAT'S UP? - THAT DOOR IS OPENING UP FOR YOU HERE REAL SOON. - WHY, WHAT'S THE SCOOP? - THE EXECS HERE ARE INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH DEB METCALFE. I TOLD 'EM ALL ABOUT HOW YOU TURNED THAT DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH INTO A SHINING STAR. - WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. - WHO CARES? NOW MAKE ME A KILLER PRESENTATION SO I CAN SELL THIS TO 'EM. - UH, WAIT, WHAT ARE-- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? - PACKAGE DEAL. THAT'S HOW I GET YOU BACK IN. YOU AND METCALFE TOGETHER. - WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO? - SHE'D BE CRAZY TO TURN IT DOWN. THE PRESTIGE OF NETWORK NEWS, NEW YORK CITY. DID I MENTION THE MONEY? - WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE-- HER CONTRACT HERE IS ALMOST UP. KFZA'S ALREADY PUSHING TO RENEGOTIATE. - NO PROBLEM. KFZA'S AN AFFILIATE. WE CAN BUY OUT HER CONTRACT. HAVE HER SIGN HERE OR THERE. IT DOESN'T MATTER. JUST LOCK HER UP. - I'LL TRY. - SELL IT TO HER, QUENTIN. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. - THANK YOU, GRANT. I WANNA GET A FEW WITH JUST DEB. - I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS BY MYSELF. - TRY PRETENDING YOU'RE ME. YOU'LL LOVE IT. OKAY. - TELL ME, WHAT ARE THOSE-- THE BIG WHITE, FLUFFY CLOUDS IN THE SKY? - CUMULUS. - CUMULUS? CUMULUS. WHAT IS THE AURORA BOREALIS AGAIN? - IT IS A NATURAL LIGHT DISPLAY-- HEY, NOBODY CARES ABOUT THIS. - HEY, HEY, HEY. YES, THEY DO, PROFESSOR. COME ON, JUST TELL US EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, AND MAKE IT EXCITING. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. RUN IT BY LEGAL AGAIN, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT CLEARED. ALL RIGHT. UM... THAT ONE. DEB, WHAT'S UP? - CAN YOU COME HELP ME OUTSIDE WITH ZEPHYR? - I REALLY LOVE THAT CAR. - MIGHT BE TIME FOR A NEW ONE. - I DON'T KNOW. IT'D BE TOO HARD TO SAY GOOD-BYE. PLUS, I CAN'T AFFORD IT. - TV JOB CAN HELP IN THAT DEPARTMENT. COME ON. I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE. - SO YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOUR LONG STORY. - WHAT LONG STORY? - WELL, ABOUT HOW YOU LOST YOUR JOB AT THE NETWORK. - OH, RIGHT. WELL, UM, I MEAN... IN A NUTSHELL, UM... A SCANDALOUS STORY WAS LEAKED ABOUT A U.S. SENATOR, AND THEN EVERY STATION RAN WITH IT. AND I JUST--I DIDN'T THINK THE SOURCE WAS CREDIBLE, SO I REFUSED. - WHAT HAPPENED? - IN THE END, THE STORY WOUND UP NOT BEING TRUE. - WELL, THEN WHY DID THEY FIRE YOU? - SOMETIMES NETWORKS, THEY LIKE TO HAVE THEIR AUDIENCE THAT NIGHT AND THEN JUST ISSUE A RETRACTION LATER RATHER THAN ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, REPORT THE TRUTH. - WELL, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. - MM-HMM. YEAH. I'VE BEEN PAYING FOR IT EVER SINCE. - IT GOT YOU HERE. - YEAH, I-- I'M REALLY GLAD I FOLLOWED MY INSTINCTS ON YOU. - HEY. - I WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK WITH FRAN TODAY. I'M SO SORRY. DR. HARRIS HAS BEEN ON MY BACK ABOUT MY DISSERTATION, AND THEN I HAD MY PHOTO SHOOT, AND THEN MY CAR DIED-- - ZEPHYR FINALLY DIED? - WELL, NOT DIED DIED, I HOPE. I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW. I HAD HER TOWED TO A MECHANIC. IT'S JUST BEEN ONE OF THOSE DAYS, YOU KNOW? I'M SO SORRY I FORGOT ABOUT OUR SESSION. CAN WE RESCHEDULE? - LOOK, I'LL MAKE IT WORK. I'LL PULL AUDIO CLIPS FROM OTHER STUFF WE SHOT, STITCH IT TOGETHER, FIX IT, AND POST, AS THEY SAY. - DID YOU WRITE THIS IN 15 MINUTES? BECAUSE THAT-- THAT'S HOW IT READS. - I CAN REVISE IT. - THERE'S NO YOU IN HERE. I MEAN, WHERE-- WHERE'S THE TRUTH? - THE TRUTH IS... I'M STRESSED. - THIS FELLOWSHIP IS BETWEEN YOU AND VERA. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE IS GIVING 200 %. WHERE ARE YOU? - MAYBE VERA'S MORE CUT OUT FOR THE JOB THAN I AM. - DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES IN LIFE THAT ONLY COMENCE? AND YOU EITHER GRAB THEM WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE OR YOU LET THEM SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS. - HOW'THE SPEECH COMING, WEATHER GIRL? - VERA, YOU'RE SMART, YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL, AND ALMOST EVERYONE LIKES YOU. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO TRY AND STEP ON ME ON YOUR ASSENT, TOO? - I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN... WHAT'S ENOUGH? - WHAT? - WHAT DO YOU THINK? - I'M SO BIG. - YES, YOU ARE. THE SKY'S THE LIMIT. - YOU LOOK GORGEOUS UP THERE, DEB. - ALMOST AS GORGEOUS AS ME. OH, PLEASE. - YOU SURE WENT TO A LOT OF TROUBLE, CONSIDERING I'M ON A SHORT-TERM CONTRACT. - EVERYBODY HERE LOVES YOU. THE AUDIENCE LOVES YOU. HOW DOES IT FEEL? - IT FEELS PRETTY GOOD. - MM. SO THIS PROBABLY WON'T COME AS MUCH OF A SURPRISE, BUT KFZA'S TALKING ABOUT RESIGNING YOU-- LONG-TERM. - YEAH? - DOES THAT MEAN YOU WOULD ACTUALLY CONSIDER IT? - WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME? - OH. WE COULD DO GREAT THINGS TOGETHER, YOU AND I, DEB. - LIKE THE SONG SAYS, WE ARE HAVING A HEAT WAVE. THIS WEEK, TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE IN THE 80s. A NICE SOUTHWESTERLY SWELL WILL BE HITTING OUBEACHES, SO MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT-- - WILLY. - RUMORS ABOUND, MY FRIEND. THAT OPEN DOOR MAY BE CLOSING SOON. THE EXECS ARE WARMING UP TO SOMEONE ELSE TO FILL THAT JOB OPENING. - CAN YOU BUY ME SOME MORE TIME? - I'LL DO WHAT I CAN. REMEMBER, IT'S YOU AND METCALFE OR NO DEAL. - YEAH. I KNOW, I GOT IT. - I CONSIDER MYSELF A KIND OF A... DOCUMENTARIAN. I'M SURE I COULD LEND SOME INSIGHT. - I CAN GIVE YOU A ROUGH CUT IF YOU'D LIKE. - CAN'T WAIT. NICE MEETING YOU, FRAN. - NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. - HEY. - HEY, THIS PLACE IS SO COOL, AND GRANT IS SO NICE. I EVEN GOT A TOUR AND EVERYTHING. - I'M SO GLAD YOU GOT TO COME CHECK OUT THE STUDIO. - LET'S GO GET SOME PIZZA. I'M STARVING. - I WAS GONNA STAY LATE AND WORK ON SOME SCHOOL STUFF. - BUT YOU GOTTA EAT THOUGH, RIGHT? - YEAH, BUT I HAVE TO SPEND SOME TIME IN HAIR AND MAKEUP, TOO. GRACE AND I ARE GONNA TRY A COUPLE NEW LOOKS. - THESE JUST CAME IN FOR YOU. - OOH! THIS, I LOVE. AND, UH, THIS IS GREAT. MAYBE TOMORROW WE COULD DO SOMETHING A-- WHAT-- - COME ON. LET'S TRY THEM ON.

YEAH, YEAH. SO CUT THAT OUT. I DON'T LIKE THAT. UM, BUT THEN USE THIS. USE THE END. - HEY. - YEAH, HEY. WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE? - WORKING ON MY SPEECH. - HOW'S IT GOING? - COULD BE BETTER. - OH, HERE. MAY I? I MEAN, YOU GOT ALL THE FACTS HERE BUT... - WHAT? - WHERE'S YOUR VOICE HERE? I MEAN, THIS... THIS KINDA OF READS LIKE A SCIENCE TEXTBOOK. - YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH IT FOR SOME REASON. - YOU JUST NEED TO CHANNEL THE PERSON THAT BLEW OFF MY DIRECTIONS AND TOLD HER AUDIENCE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM A LITTLE OLD TORNADO. - WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON? - I HAVE A POTENTIAL NEW YORK JOB THING. - OH. BACK TO NEW YORK? - WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY... - WHAT? - NOTHING. UM, NOTHING. ARE YOU HUNGRY? - NO, BUT THE CRAZY THING IS-- I MEAN, I GREW UP IN SAN DIEGO MY ENTIRE LIFE. AND I NEVER HAD TO BRANCH OUT, NEVER HAD TO CHANGE. - WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE. - WHERE WOULD I LIVE? - I DON'T KNOW. NEW YORK? WHAT? I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE SHOULD LIVE IN NEW YORK AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIVES. LOOK, THE WORLD'S ALWAYS CHANGING--YOU CAN'T FIGHT IT. YOU GOT TO CHANGE WITHIN, OR YOU GET LEFT BEHIND. - MM-MM. NO, SEE, WHEN EVERYTHING AROUND ME IS CHANGING, IT GIVES ME COMFORT TO THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF OURSELVES, THE TRUEST PARTS-- THEY NEVER CHANGE. - IF I COULD CHANGE ONE THING IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW... - WHAT? - I WISH I COULD FIND US A SHOOTING STAR. - HEY, YOU KNOW THAT FEELING I HAD ABOUT YOU? IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIP. DEB. YOU SCARED ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LOOKING AT CARS? I THOUGHT YOU GOT ZEPHYR FIXED. - I DID. I WAS JUST THINKING MAYBE IT'S TIME TO RETIRE HER. - DR. HARRIS LEFT YOU, LIKE, THREE MESSAGES HERE. I KNOW. SHE HAS LEFT MESSAGES ON MY CELL PHONE TOO. - YOUR PRESENTATION'S, LIKE, RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. - MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT IN THE CARDS FOR ME. - YOU'VE WORKED YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS. AND YOU GO AND CHANGE YOUR HAIR AND PUT ON A LITTLE MAKEUP AND GET SOME ATTENTION, AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA THROW IT ALL AWAY? - HEY. OH. YOU ALL RIGHT? HEY. FRAN AND I HAD A FIGHT. NOT LIKE A FIGHT FIGHT, BUT WHATEVER. - WHAT WAS IT ABOUT? - ME. SHE THINKS I'M GIVING UP ON THE FELLOWSHIP. SHE THINKS I'VE CHANGED, NOT FOR THE BETTER. - HAVE YOU CHANGED? - WHAT DO YOU THINK? - I DIDN'T THINK YOU NEEDED TO GIVE YOURSELF A MAKEOVER. I THOUGHT YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL BEFORE. YOU JUST DIDN'T REALIZE IT. I THINK THAT WHAT YOU TOLD ME THE OTHER NIGHT IS TRUE-- THAT THE TRUEST PART OF OURSELVES NEVER CHANGES. YOU'RE GONNA BE FANTASTIC IN WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO, DEB METCALFE. - WE'LL SEE IF THAT'S TRUE TOMORROW. - YOUR SPEECH-- ARE YOU PREPARED? NOT AT ALL, BUT I STILL HAVE TONIGHT TO WORK ON IT. - DOWN TO THE WIRE. - HEY, QUENTIN? I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO BE THERE. - I WOULDN'T MISS IT FOR THE WORLD. - I'M STARING AT THE PLACE WHERE, IN AN HOUR, I'LL BE GIVING THE SPEECH THAT DETERMINES THE REST OF MY LIFE. - THAT'S A GREAT SELF-PEP TALK. - OKAY, YOU TRY. - LISTEN TO ME. YOU'RE ARTICULATE. YOU'RE AMUSING. YOU GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. - YEAH, EXCEPT A ROOM FULL OF HIGHBROW ACADEMICS JUDGING ME. - HEY, FIND ME IN THE AUDIENCE. TELL IT TO ME. YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT. - ARE YOU GONNA BE HERE ON? - YEP. I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW. I'LL SEE YOU SOON. YEAH. ALL RIGHT, PUT HIM ON. HEY, UH, WILLY, UH, CAN I CALL YOU BACK? I'M RUNNING LATE RIGHT NOW. - WE GOT YOU ON SPEAKERPHONE HERE, BUDDY. YOU'RE WITH THE CFO, THE STATION MANAGER, AND THE GENERAL MANAGER. - YEAH, SURE. GO AHEAD. - IF YOU WAN TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE, YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR TOOLS SHARP. AND THOSE WIELDING THE BLADE BETTER KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I AM HONORED TO HAVE STUDIED HERE AND HOPE TO CONTINUE MY WORK FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU. - THANK YOU, VERA. WE'RE GONNA TAKE A SHORT BREAK AND COME BACK WITH OUR NEXT FELLOWSHIP CANDIDATE, DEB METCALFE. - NICE JOB ON YOUR SPEECH, VERA. - I THOUGHT IT WENT WELL, BUT THEN AGAIN, I WAS MADE FOR THIS TYPE OF THING. YOU ACTUALLY SURPRISED ME HOW WELL YOU WERE ABLE TO STEP IT UP. YOU REALLY ARE LEARNING HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. GOOD LUCK, WEATHER GIRL. I HAD A SPEECH PREPARED, BUT I WAS HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME WITH IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT HAD TO BE PERFECT. BUT IT'S JUST OCCURRED TO ME... THAT I'M NOT THE RIGHT CANDIDATE FOR THIS FELLOWSHIP BECAUSE I'M PERFECT. I'M THE RIGHT CANDIDATE FOR THIS FELLOWSHIP BECAUSE I HAVE LOVED METEOROLOGY SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL. IT HAS BEEN MY FOCUS FOR MOST OF MY LIFE. AND WITH YOUR HELP, I CAN CONTINUE TO BRING THAT FOCUS TO THIS UNIVERSITY. I GOT DISTRACTED BY THE ATTENTION AND PRAISE THAT I RECEIVED BECAUSE I WAS ON TV. BUT I TOOK THAT JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE IT PROVIDED ME WITH AN OPPORTUNITY OUTSIDE OF THIS UNIVERSITY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT THE WEATHER. I CONSIDER IT A PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO SHARE MY KNOWLEDGE AND CONTINUE THIS INSPIRATION THROUGH MY WORK. I JUST WANT TO CONTINUE DOING THAT HERE. - YOU THINK I DID OKAY? - DEB, YOU NAILED IT. IT WAS SO AMAZING, AND IT WAS FROM YOUR HEART. - SO THAT REMINDS ME-- OH, DEAR, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WHAT ABOUT YOUR-- BUT SHE'S-- - I GUESS DR. HARRIS DIDN'T THINK SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. - LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE VERA. - YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. - OH, I'M SO SORRY. I HAD TO TAKE A PHONE CALL. - I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS TO IT. I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME. - I'M... HOW DID IT GO? - I DON'T THINK I GOT THE FELLOWSHIP. - I AM SO SORRY. LOOK, MAYBE IT WILL HELP. THE PHONE CALL I REALLY HAD TO TAKE-- NEW YORK WANTS BOTH OF US. - WAIT. WHAT? IS THAT WHY YOU GAVE ME THAT SPEECH ABOUT HOW EVERYONE SHOULD LIVE IN NEW YORK ONCE IN THEIR LIFE? - NO. I MEANT THAT. I MEAN, IT'S NEW YORK. I MEAN, BOTH OF US TOGETHER, OUR DREAM JOB. - YOUR DREAM, NOT MINE. - I KNOW YOU DIDN'T PLAN THIS. BUT THAT'S--THAT'S ONE HECK OF A CONSOLATION PRIZE. - I MEAN, YOU'RE USED TO JUMPING AROUND FROM CITY TO CITY, SO YOU--YOU JUST GO. I LIVE HERE. - WELL, NO, IF YOU DON'T GO TO NEW YORK, I'M NOT GOING TO NEW YORK. - YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME? - I DON'T--I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD ME. IT'S YOU AND ME TOGETHER. THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. THAT'S THE PACKAGE. HAVE YOU BEEN SHOPPING ME AROUND THIS ENTIRE TIME? - NO-- DEB, NO. - IS THAT ALL THERE WAS BETWEEN US? IS IT--WAS THAT IT? - NO. NO, THAT WASN'T. I NEVER LIED TO YOU ABOUT ANYTHING. - YOU JUST DIDN'T REVEAL THE DETAILS OF THE STORY. - YEAH, LET'S JUST KEEP THAT PACE CLIPPING ALONG TODAY. GRANT, I LOVE YOU. NOT AS MUCH AD-LIBBING. - GONNA GET ANGRY LETTERS, BUT OKAY. - ALL RIGHT, COME ON, LET'S GET TO IT. - ALL RIGHT, SO I WAS THINKING, HOW ABOUT WE MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND SHOOT A WEATHER SEGMENT FROM THE ROOF TOMORROW? THERE'S GREAT VIEW UP THERE. - LET'S JUST STICK TO THE SET, HUH? - LITTLE CHILLY WITH THE WEATHERGIRL? - OH, THAT WAS NOTHING. - OH, GREAT. SO SHE'LL RENEW HER CONTRACT. - LOOK, I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE ON. - NO, IT REALLY IS QUITE GOOD. I-I THINK WITH THE CHANGES THAT I'VE OUTLINED, IT COULD EVEN BE GREAT. - REALLY? - MM-HMM. - SO GLAD YOU LIKED IT. - JOSH, YOU SHOULD WATCH FRAN'S DOCUMENTARY. THIS YOUNG LADY IS QUITE THE FILM MAKER. - YEAH, SURE. - DEB'S IN IT. - DEB? LOVE TO TAKE A LOOK. THANK YOU. - OH. "COME SEE ME." MAKE IT OFFICIAL, I SUPPOSE. - A WORD? WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A MINUTE AND LOOK THIS OVER? - WHAT IS IT? - YOUR NEW CONTRACT. YOUR SHORT-TERM'S ALMOST UP AND WE'RE ALL EAGER TO HAVE YOU RE-SIGN. - I KNOW IT SEEMS STRANGE, BUT I STILL WANT TO BE AN ACADEMIC. - IT'S A VERY GENEROUS OFFER. AT LEAST LOOK AT IT. IMPRESSED? - YES. AND I APPRECIATE IT, I DO, BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED. I WANT TO STAY IN ACADEMIA. I GOT TO RUN TO THE UNIVERSITY. I'LL BE BACK LATER. - MM-HMM. OKAY. WE'LL TRY THIS ANOTHER WAY. I WANT LEGAL IN MY OFFICE IN TEN MINUTES. I HAVE A CONTRACT ISSUE. - HEY, DEB. - DEB, COME ON IN. LISTEN, I AM REALLY SORRY THAT I HAD TO RUSH OUT YESTERDAY. I HAD A FAMILY EMERGENCY. - IS EVERYTHING OKAY? - NO, EVERYTHING'S FINE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I BROUGHT YOU IN TODAY. YOU GOT THE FELLOWSHIP. - WHAT? - THEY ANNOUNCED IT THIS MORNING. - I GOT IT? - YES. - I GOT IT? - YES! CONGRATULATIONS! - WOW! WHA-- ARE YOU KIDDING ME? - NO! WHY WOULD I KID WITH YOU? LOOK AT ALL THIS HARD WORK THAT YOU DID. I MEAN IT. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. - OH! - I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. - WOW. SOFT BREEZES PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH THE WEATHER THIS WEEK. SO, HEY, GO FLY A KITE. - I THINK SHE'S TALKING TO YOU. - GO TO GRANT NOW. - THANKS, DEB. AND WHEN WE COME BACK, THE GRUNION ARE RUNNING... - BET YOU ASSUMED BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GET DEB TO RE-SIGN, IT WAS A DONE DEAL. - THEY OFFERED HER THE FELLOWSHIP. IT'S OVER. - WE'LL SEE. - HEY, DEB. I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS ON THE FELLOWSHIP. - THANKS. - OF COURSE I HAD A FEW CLINGING HOPES. - DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. LOOK. I KNOW THIS SEEMS LIKE A SHAM, BUT IT WASN'T. I'M SO SORRY IF YOU THINK THAT-- - YOU KNOW WHAT, QUENTIN? IT'S BEEN A LONG COUPLE DAYS. I'M JUST GONNA SAY GOOD NIGHT. - I WAS KIND OF HOPING IT WOULDN'T START. - GET AN EARLY START ON TOMORROW'S BOARD? - YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. - HOW ABOUT THIS FOR A SEGMENT? - I'M NOT SURE... HOW MUCH YOU THINK YOU KNOW. - YOU DON'T LAST AS LONG IN THIS BUSINESS AS I HAVE ON PERSONALITY ALONE. SO YOU KNOW ABOUT ME AND DEB? - I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND DEB AND THE NEW YORK OFFER. YOUR FRIEND WILLY LIKES TO BOAST TO HIS FRIENDS. AND SOME OF HIS FRIENDS ARE MY FRIENDS. - DOES WANTING NEW YORK MAKE ME A JERK? - NO. USING DEB TO GET IT DOES. I TRIED TO APOLOGIZE TO HER. - I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR OVER 30 YEARS, QUENTIN. HERE'S MY ADVICE TO YOU. BEING SORRY ISN'T ENOUGH. A WOMAN NEEDS TO KNOW THAT SHE CAN COUNT ON YOU. SHOULD DEB EVER BE ABLE TO TRUST YOU AGAIN? IF SO, YOU NEED TO SHOW HER. ♪ ♪ - WHAT? NO. SHE'S LEAVING WHEN HER CONTRACT IS UP. I ALREADY CONFIRMED THAT. WHY? WHO SIGNED OFF ON A NEW CONTRACT? HEY, I'LL BE RIGHT OUT FOR THOSE. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY DID YOU ORDER ANOTHER CONTRACT FOR DEB? I TOLD YOU SHE GOT THE FELLOWSHIP. - WHILE YOU WERE OUT GETTING YOUR HEART BROKEN, I WAS TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS. - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - FRAN'S DOCUMENTARY, STARRING DEB. I SAY THE WORD AND IT'S OUR PROPERTY AS EVIDENCE IN A LAWSUIT. - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. A LAWSUIT? WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT? - I DON'T, REALLY. AND I CAN MAKE EVERYTHING OKAY IF DEB JUST AGREES TO EXTEND HER EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT. - AND WHAT A WONDERFUL WORKING RELATIONSHIP YOU'LL HAVE ESTABLISHED. - I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO. - YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IN ALL OF THIS, JOSH, IS THAT THE NETWORK WANTS DEB. SO THEY'RE GONNA COME IN HERE AND BUY HER LITTLE AFFILIATE CONTRACT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDERNEATH YOU ANYWAY, SO THERE'S NO POINT IN THIS. - YOU WERE USING HER TO BROKER A DEAL WITH NEW YORK TO GET YOU BACK IN THE DOOR. DOES SHE KNOW THAT? WELL, THAT WILL COST THEM A PRETTY PENNY, WHICH IS MORE THAN WE'D GET FROM DEB IF WE JUST LET HER WALK. THE SUITS WILL APPRECIATE THAT. AND YOU GET TO GO BACK TO NEW YORK. EVERYBODY WINS. I'M IMPRESSED, GOLDEN BOY. - EVERYTHING I WANT--WANTED-- AT THE COST OF LOSING THE BEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME. - SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? - MUST BE SOMETHING I'M NOT THINKING OF. - WELL, MAYBE THIS IS ONE THING YOU CAN'T FIX. - I JUST--I AT LEAST HAVE TO WARN HER BEFORE SHE GETS IN HERE. - WHAT KIND OF A PERSON SMILES AT YOU ONE MINUTE, THEN STABS YOU IN THE BACK THE NEXT? - IT'S JUST BUSINESS. DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY. YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LOT OF GROWING UP TO DO. - DON'T TALK TO HER LIKE THAT. - YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS? WHAT, WAS THIS THE ACE UP YOUR SLEEVE THE ENTIRE TIME? - NO, UNH-UH, I HAD NO INTENTION OF IT ENDING UP LIKE THIS. - RIGHT. - DEB... - OH, HE HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT. AS SOON AS YOU SIGN WITH US, NEW YORK WILL BUY OUT YOUR CONTRACT, SO QUENTIN GETS IT ALL. - YOU WARNED ME YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D GO THIS FAR. - LET'S FINISH THIS, PLEASE. HERE'S YOUR CONTRACT. SIGN IT AND FRAN'S HAPPY, QUENTIN'S HAPPY, I'M HAPPY. YOU? WELL, THREE OUT OF FOUR AIN'T BAD. - WAIT, WAIT. DEB METCALF... YOU'RE FIRED. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. - I JUST DID IT IN FRONT OF ALL THESE WITNESSES. - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT OF YOUR CONTRACT IS IF YOU'RE FIRED. SO YOU ARE NO LONGER UNDER ANY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO KFZA NEWS. - YOU'RE AN IDIOT. YOU KNOW THAT? YOU'RE THROWING AWAY NEW YORK! - I DON'T CARE. - YOU'RE FIRED, QUENTIN! - TOO LATE. BESIDES, YOU CAN'T FIRE ME WITHOUT APPROVAL FROM THE UPSTAIRS. - WHAT ABOUT NEW YORK? - I THINK SAN DIEGO HAS A LOT TO OFFER ME. I SAW THAT ONE. - FINALLY.
