How do you document real life When real life's getting more Like fiction each day? Headlines, bread lines Blow my mind And now this deadline Eviction or pay Rent How do you write a song When the chords sound wrong?

It reaches way down deep And tears you inside out Till you're torn apart Rent How can you connect in an age Where strangers, landlords, lovers Your own blood cells betray? What binds the fabric together When the raging, shifting winds Of change keep ripping away?

My canteen had sprung a Ieak, and I was... ...thirsty. Out of the abyss waIked a cow. EIsie. I asked if she had anything to drink. She said: ''I'm forbidden to produce milk In Cyberland we only drink Diet Coke'' She said: ''Only thing to do Is jump over the moon'' I Gotta get out of here It's like I'm being tied to the hood Of a yellow rental truck Being packed in With fertilizer and fuel oil Pushed over a cliff By a suicidal Mickey Mouse I've Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta Gotta, gotta find a way To jump over the moon Only thing to do Is jump over the moon Yeah!

And aIthough he once had principIes... ...he abandoned them to Iive as a Iapdog... ...to a weaIthy daughter of the revoIution. A one, two, three ''That's bull,'' he said ''Ever since the cat took up the fiddle That cow's been jumpy The dish and the spoon were evicted From the table and eloped She's had trouble with that milk And the moon ever since Maybe it's a female thing 'Cause who'd wanna leave Cyberland anyway? Walls ain't so bad The dish and the spoon, for instance, They're down on their luck They come knockin' On my doghouse door And I say, 'Not in my back yard, utensils. Go back to China''' ''The onIy way out is up,'' EIsie whispered to me. ''A leap Of faith'' -Yeah. -That's it. ''StiII thirsty?'' ''Parched.'' ''Have some miIk.'' And I Iowered myseIf beneath her swoIIen udder... ...and I sucked the sweetest miIk I had ever tasted. ''CIimb onboard,'' she said. And as a harvest moon rose over CyberIand... ...we reared back, we sprang into a gaIIop... ...Ieaping out of orbit. I awoke, singing... Leap of faith Leap of faith Leap of faith Leap of faith Only thing to do Only thing to do is jump Only thing to do is Jump over the moon Only thing to do is Jump over the moon Over the moon Over the....
