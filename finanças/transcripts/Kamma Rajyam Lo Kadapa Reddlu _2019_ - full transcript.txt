BEFORE THE ELECTION RESULTS [crowd cheering] I came here to make a long political journey! Films are nothing to me! I've decided not to act in films anymore. You can question me if I don't stand on my word. On this occasion, I'm saying something to you all. If I win or lose in the politics, I'll be the one in you all. I'll be with the people. I won't waste valuable time of doing service to you by acting in films. This is my promise... This my promise to all of you on the behalf of Mana Sena Party. 'Mana Sena' will win. 'Mana Sena' will win. And it'll take each one of them to the task! I'll come to your towns. [crowd hailing] Next week I'll come to Ongole, Rayalseema and to Guntur. You all should come and we should meet. Only then we will get the governance. Only then the minority and the weaker sections will win. Only then there would be the state development. This is the truth of God from God. [hailing] [hailing] 40 years of political experience. I served three times as the chief minister. I've established the Hyderabad. Will Amaravati develop if I come? Or will it develop of a fledgeling with no experience I'll ask to whom you are going to vote. Then you tell me that it's for the tyre symbol. -You would vote to... -Crowd: To the tyre symbol... -You would vote to... -Crowd: To the tyre symbol... We are certainly going to win. Jai Velugu Desam! AFTER THE ELECTION RESULTS I, V.S Jagannatha Reddy, [crowd cheering] crowd hailing: V.S Solemnly affirm that I will bear full faith and loyalty towards the constitution of India which is by ordinance established, that I will protect the sovereignty and integrity of India. As a Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, I will fulfill my responsibilities with dedication and, conscientiously perform my duties, without fear or favor, affection or ill will, I will follow the constitution and law, to protect all the people and do justice. I swear in the name of God. [crowd cheering] crowd hailing: V.S crowd hailing: V.S [weeping] Babu... open the door. Babu. Chinna Babu, it's you I'm calling... open the door -I, Chinna Babu -Babu...! -As a Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh...! -Chinna Babu, what happened to you? Chinna Babu, open the door. Babu... Chinna Babu. It's tough to survive for five years in such circumstances. You'd be of 70 years by then! Not just that, meanwhile if that short guy doesn't take over our party! It doesn't mean that we are finished if we lost. This is a new situation to us. That's all! I know very well how to develop the party. I'm there for you. Your son will become the CM. Be patient. [birds chirping] [engine starts] He always says that he knows very well how to develop the party. He doesn't know anything! He ruined the party with the love on his son. Let's see what he does! Hell with it! The day he suicide is nearing. Drive... Don't cry, Chinna Babu! Why are you crying? We will have our time too. Now, it's their time. AMMA RAJYAM LO KADAPA BIDDALU "There are no swords and blood splatter now" "The methods of waging war has been changed now" "New war... This is a new war" "New war... This is a new war" "We are the leaders made by media and law is our weapon" "This is an arena where honour and lives would be taken away" "Strategic moves are made with a smile, this is a silent turmoil" "Opponents would be terrified and there's no way outside here" "And there's no way outside here" "New war... This is a new war" Breaking news! Bewildered by the sudden unpredicted political outcome, Depression about their risk of survival, has engulfed the father-son duo belonging to the lost party. When that's case... On the other side, as their leader became the CM, some of the people of the incumbent party wanted to take advantage of it and fantasizing about it. I've called all of you to talk about an important matter. Some of you might be in the faction backdrop. But now, we are in the power. Hence, don't abuse it. We have to change our ways and be at peace. We have to establish peaceful atmosphere in Vijayawada. That's all! Hmm... Hmm... If someone opposes it and go against me, I will not forgive despite being my men. -"There are no swords..." -Obulu. "and blood splatter now" "The methods of waging war has been changed now" "New war... This is a new war" "New war... This is a new war" "We are the leaders made by media and the law is our weapon" "This is an arena where honour and lives would be taken away" [Tollywood song playing] "Numpty boy... Wiener kid" "I'm feel pained though I can't complain" I know. I'm simply writing. "Numpty boy... Wiener kid" "I'm feel pained though I can't complain" "How long should I carry this burden by peddaling a cycle?" "When you learn it, I can hand over the handle to you" "When you pedal a cycle, I'll inflate its tyre" "If the chain breaks" "I will join the link" "I'll play percussions cheering your pedaling" [music mutes voice] "Oh modest daddy, I'm telling you with affection" "Please don't cry profusely by holding the cycle" "Daddy, as your cycle tyre got punctured now" "it's looks like you are blaming me and weeping" Look... You should say... Greetings to all the workers. -Greetings to all the workers. -Not like that... A little higher. "You have santached your grandfather's cycle and pedaling it" "And you want me as well, to pedal it" "I'm not interested. Leave me, I'll go by walk" "And as age has caught up with you," "Why don't you get rid of that cycle?"

[birds chirping] Is it important for you to go to the assembly at this moment? Let's go somewhere until situation settle down. Else his men would overpower you with rants. Look Chinna Babu, there are 151 goats, 22 tigers and a lion in the assembly. We shouldn't get scared of the goats. We should make them scared. Bye, father. [siren] Sir. Hmm! -Did you wash? -I washed it with the mineral water, sir. Very good. You speak. Mr. Speaker, they name their programs in a very good way. 'Neeru-Chettu' (Water-Tree), 'Vanam-Manam' (Forest-Us), the next scheme is 'Mee Intiki Mee Bhumi' (Your land for your house). Most of them are already afraided, Mr. Speaker, that their lands might've gone to these people. 'Happy Sunday,' did they ever make the Sunday a happy one? Their highlight program is, 'Domalapai Dandayatra' (attach on mosqutoes) What the hell are you talking? -Think before you utter! -Hold on! It's a fact, Mr. Speaker. [indistinct voices] Mr. Speaker, attack on mosquitoes. -Keep quiet... Keep quiet... -Mr. Speaker, what is this? -Keep quiet... -Hold on for a minute! -Okay...! -Should we keep quiet while they... -...mock an experienced leader? -Let me complete! I'll give you a chance. -Mr. Speaker! -Let him speak. Mr. Speaker, in our Kurnool... -You don't have the guts to do! -Hold on...! -How dare you mock Mr. Babu! -Mr. Speaker. There is a huge cut out of Mr. Babu in Kurnool. -It will be very huge like Bahubali. -Hmm. It has a huge crown, sword in his hands and a mosquito beside the sword. [chaos] Sit down... What is this? -Sit down... I'll give you a chance. -What kind of governance is this? -I don't understand this! -Keep quiet... Keep quiet... -Keep quiet...! -Am I not saying the facts? Yes, sir! Why is it so sour? -Know the subject and speak! -There is a rumour, Mr. Speaker! -Sit down! -What is it? The matter is weak but the publicity is in peaks! -Once again, Mr. Speaker! -[indistinct voices] -Hold on! Keep quiet...! -The matter is weak... -...but the publicity is in peaks! -Keep quiet! -That's all, Mr. Speaker! -Sit down...! [crowd shouting] Mrs. Puja, you speak! Mr. Speaker, we follow our leader's path. And that's the reason we are staying calm and tolerating these 'Velugu Desam's' non sense! They just lie all the time! [patting the table] Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Puja is well experienced in the films, and delivering the dialogues... -...in the assembly as if it's a shooting! -Mr. Chowdary! -How dare you mock the development... -Sit down! -...made by him! -Mrs. Puja is speaking, isn't she? Hey! You'd die if you shout aloud! -Okay... -Shut your mouth and sit down! -I'm sparing you since it's the assembly! -She is not respecting the age! It would've been different if it was outside the assembly! The film hasn't finished yet but it has started now! You'll be finished by the interval scene! [chaos] Do you have the eligibility... -...to compare yourself with Mr. Babu? -Keep quiet... What is she saying Mr. Speaker? [calling bell ringing] Won't you give us a chance Mr. Speaker? -Huh? -Mr. Babu, please speak! Mr. Speaker, what the hell are they talking? My experience is more than your age! They are doing charade! Mr. Speaker, even we meant that he is old. Ask him to go and play with his grandchildren. You speak, Mr. Anil. Mr. Babu, don't irritate us by repeating the same things. Mr. Speaker... [indistinct voices] The tenure isn't important, it's important whether the bullet is fired or not. Hmm! Yours is a lucky lottery but mine is history. You keep watching, your history turns into a mystery. -Mr. Speaker. -Mr. Babu, you please continue. I've established the Hi-tech city! I've built the Outer Ring Road and the international airport. I've fostered the Telugu people's pride. How dare are they to talk about my history! -What the hell are they speaking? -Okay, sit down Mr. Babu. Are you speaking about the pride? It's you who backstabbed that pride! What are you talking? Would you speak whatever you feel like? Please keep quiet... Keep quiet... [indistinct voices] Please keep quiet... Keep quiet... -What are you talking? -Please, sit down. Mr. Babu, please ask your men to sit down. [crowd shouting] Let him finish. Sit down, he is talking, isn't he? What the hell are you saying? Do you ever have the experience of handling the government? -Sit down... Sit down... -How dare you criticise Mr. Babu? -By seeing the development by Mr. Babu... -Sit down...! -Please, sit down... -...and by not being able to cope, -...you are talking so! -Sit down... Sit down... -You are not following the assembly rules. -Sit down... Sit down... He is being rude with the former chief minister! The development made by Babu... Do you have the right to compare with Mr. Babu? Mr. Speaker... [indistinct voices] Keep quiet... Keep quiet... [call bell ringing] Keep quiet... Keep quiet... Keep quiet... Keep quiet... Are you the fifth-grade studying children? Huh? Shouting at each other, fighting, plucking hair, threatening to beat, throwing chalk piece at the teacher! I've seen all of these in my fifth standard itself! Have some decency! Discuss seriously on the public issues. Hmm! [scoffs] -Sir... -Hmm...! -Do you want a glass of water? -No, thanks. You talk. Mr. Speaker, coming to the Department of Irrigation, 10,000 cusecs water which should come in a minute or in 20 seconds, wouldn't come even in an hour in the previous government. -But in our governance... -[snoring] [snoring] [snoring] -Sir... Sir... -Keep quiet... Keep quiet... -Sir, everybody is already quiet. -I know. -I told myself to keep quiet! -Okay, sir. Mr. Tadipaka of Mana Sena. Mr. Speaker, let me open the paper. What would you achieve by coming here alone? Alone? How could you laugh at me? Why are you laughing? He is speaking, isn't he? Please, keep quiet! Mr. Speaker, ignore that... The numbers are read from 1 to 151. Similarly, they read from 1 to 24 but they don't say 'Number 1.' I am the 'Number 1,' Mr. Speaker. Why did our leader make me win and sent here? It's to fight against the public issues. I'm the number one in this assembly. -Why don't you give me a chance? -[crowd shouting] -Mr. Speaker, give me a chance to speak. -[crowd shouting] Mr. CM, you please talk. Mr. Speaker, what Mr. Babu says looks like... 'Our ancestors were great, so assume we are too' He stills feels that he is the CM. Mr. Speaker, tell him that he belongs to the opposition party. -Keep quiet... Keep quiet... -What the hell are you talking? -Sit down... Sit down... -Mr. Speaker... -You are being impolite with our leader! -Keep quiet... Keep quiet... You don't have respect. You don't have courtesy! -The CM is speaking, isn't he? -And you say yourself as the rulers! -And you say you ruled for 80 years... -Keep quiet... Keep quiet... -What are you saying? -Sit down... Sit down... -Hold on... Keep quiet... Keep quiet... -Do you think as if it is your Kadapa? -Mr. Speaker, they don't respect. -What are you talking? Do you ever have the experience of handling the government? We need not learn from you! [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] -What are you saying? -Mr Speaker. What the hell are you saying? -What Mr Babu said is like... -How can you criticize the elders? What do you know about our leader? -Mr Bhicchamma Naidu... -Do you even have... -...eligibility to talk about our leader? -Sit down! -How can you criticize Mr Babu? -Sit down! Sit down! -Is this any proper behaviour? -Sit down! Do you know the assembly etiquette? There's one here who'd get scared if you widen your eyes! Is this the way of behaving in the assembly? -Bulking up is not enough... -What are you talking? -Use your brain as well! -Is this the way a CM should talk? You're just a footman. [weeping] What happened, Biccham? I don't mind if he called me a dog or swine or a bull, sir. But he called me a footman, sir! Calm down... Just calm down. -[weeping] -Don't cry. Calm down... Just calm down. [cameras click] I felt very sad after watching the assembly sessions on the TV. I couldn't sleep last night. I doubted if our nation is really democratic! Instead of discussing the public problems in the assembly, they are chiding each other which is a very unfortunate thing. I'm telling just one thing, the day I become the CM, I'll pass a law which would make only the CM to talk in the assembly. Hmm! Be wary of it! Hail Mana Sena! Arrange a meeting with all our people, in the evening. We shall think of ways to make our party appeasing to the public. Hmm... Where is the rest of the security? Sir, the thing is that... By keeping economic needs of the state in mind, the government felt that the Z-category security... ...is not needed for the opposition leader. So, it would provide only mandatory minimal security. I'm sure they've done this to humiliate you, father. Since they've been humiliating you so much, can't you do anything about it? What can we do? We have to wait for the right time. [music over voice] [siren wailing] Don't think you'd free after this slap, Obulu. There is an ongoing case against you as per law. I didn't do anything, brother. Do you think that we came to power to do atrocities? Well, try to prove yourself innocent in the court. Get out of here. The thing is that... Umm... No matter how much I tell you, you don't mend your old habits. -I somehow feel that he's reformed. -Hmph! -I don't trust. Keep an eye on him. -Hmm... What's happening in this state? I feel pained to see these circumstances. They've ignored Nelson Mandela's words of living in harmony irrespective of caste and religion. and committing murders in this manner. And don't think that I would stay mum like Velugu Desam Party members. I'm there for every person from this caste. Our soldiers are there for you. Remember this. Slowly, high intense tensions began internally in Vijayawada. Whatever happens in any corner of the state, the accusers are blaming the incumbent party as if a stined glass shows the other side with stains CROWD: CM... Down... Down..._______ When that's the situation, Mr Babu, who was ex-CM, is going through mental agony thinking whether his past mistakes are responsible for his terrible defeat. [bangles tinkling] Dear husband... Come, let's have dinner. Father-in-law, how long will you be like this? Come to the dinner. Forgive me, Ramani. What happened? I know your pain, dear. Mr Babu, all our people are here to talk to you. Father-in-law is not in a state to talk. Mr Babu has to compulsorily talk now. He should know about what's happening in the capital. This isn't the problem of state or its people to leave it to itself. This is our problem. Our party's problem. Mr Babu, what shall we do? Brother... I'm talking to you. The from Kadapa region leaders have curbed... our valuable Amaravathi and Krishna areas like ghosts. The ghosts wouldn't remain idle, they are sucking our blood. They've put their hotel beside ours. We have tolerated that. It is our land and they're doing the real estate business. We have tolerated that as well. They've killed four of our men as they weren't obeying them, sir. All these days, we did politics. But they are indulged only in factionism. They have no diplomacy. They just decide that's it. Vijaywada, which used to be adorned in yellow colour until recenty, turned white like a pearl. Wherever you see, all you can find are white shirts and white lungis attire. It's true, brother. We're ensuring that this news isn't reaching you as you'd become sad but, our people are standing behind the doors and peeping through holes of windows. If this continues, our farms would also turn white from yellow, and become red due to blood, after they chop. Do something, brother. Look, patience is the key for everything. Trust me and be patient for few more days. Everything will come into our hands. I'll take the party as well as every one of you, forward. Tell the same to all our people. Rama, do something. I wasn't able to bear when he was making fun of me. When he is going against me, I wasn't able to tolerate. Brother, when you, being a leader, is saying like this... Rama, I never missed any opportunity till now. I've backstabbed the chief by using Parvathy. Why go that far? I have even backstabbed the people of Telangana, by grabbing lands in the name of Hitech city. I know very well what it is to be in power and its pride, Rama. But do you know who has backstabbed me even after having done these things? It is the God. God gave me a fool as my child and backstabbed me. Whenever he goes into his room and weeps by covering himself in a blanket, I'm dying because of that, Rama. Brother, don't worry. Don't even think of being haste. I'll see that I'll stomp him so deep that he can't get up, and make the junior as CM. Trust me. I'm with you. As per Dayaneni Rama's vow to Mr Babu, he thought of ways to bring terrible negativity about the incumbent governemnt. On the other side, the CM is busy with his government work, without bothering about the terrible plots that are being hatched behind him. To claim that the accusations of Jagannath and his minsters regarding the Polavaram project to be wrong, I've called for this press meet to answer him in a such way that he wouldn't question anymore. Because there is need for the people to know the truth today. There might be 23 of our MLAs in the assembly. But, there are some crores of Velugu Desam warriors outside who are still alive. What's with defeat? [scoffs] It is like summer season. It won't be permanent. [clears throat] This is the letter given by the department officer of the Polarvaram project stating that it need not be stalled. This is the letter given by the special officer and the chief officer stating that no fraud had happened in the investments of that project. Jagannath Reddy, mend your ways and behaviour at least now. [music mutes whispering] Respected people, I have a question. When the rowdies who are litterally illiterate entered the assembly and speaking obnoxiously to a populist leader who is having 40 years of experience and making fun of him, the CM laughed along with them instead of chiding them. Is that assembly etiquette? I'm asking this question to the public. When the people voted him and made him as the CM, he demeaned that position and the assembly. This behaviour is very the deceitful. The people would teach him a lesson. And we announce that we'll oppose this CM. [camera clicks] Isn't destroying public platforms same as destroying the sentiment of public? Jagannath Reddy, the people are questioning. Why did we start 'Anna Canteen'? To ensure that no poor man should starve and have good food. You have scrapped that. How can you eat when you have hit on poor man's hunger? We're ready to even sacrifice our lives for the people. Why aren't you providing food to the poor? Who has given you the right to scrap it? You have pleaded the people to give you one chance, made them vote to you and scrapped the scheme that provides food to the poor. Jagannath Reddy, this is my warning to you. Don't you make the poor people starve! Jagannath Reddy, you know better than everyone that you are afterall a CM due to EVM. Introspect yourself at least now. Jagannath Reddy, your plots and conspiracies are coming to light now. We'll annhilate you. No MLA of your party would come to assembly. Jagannath Reddy joined hands with those who have filed cases against the Polavaram project. If we stay silent, the public would think that we've done wrong... Moreover, it is a cakewalk for them to cheat and betray people. People might believe that he is telling the truth. I too feel the same. Arrange for a press meet. [camera clicks] It's been not even ten months that I've become the CM. And within this time, there are a hell lot of accusations on me by the opposition. They claim that I'm trying to stall the Polavaram project. The Polavaram project is my father's dream. Will I stall that? They claim that I've admitted rowdies in my party and made them sit in the assembly. My party has the most number of educated leaders in this country. Another surprising accusation is that, they claim that I'm making taking away the food from the poor man. When his government who never bothered about the farmers is accusing me about this, I feel sad. They've been accusing me of crimes on hourly basis. Some of them are accusing that me and men are behind every murder and every crime that took place in the state. My silence doesn't mean that those are true. I'm not paying heed to the street dogs that are barking. When you blabber something about me from now, don't forget that I'm living in Vijayawada too. [music mutes voice] We got the power but we couldn't get grip in the capital. Their reign is still running. We have to do something big for that, so that the state would be inclining towards us. That freaking Rama... He is blabbering about our leader. If we kill him... Obulu is right. Killing 23 of them at once will get us rid of this mess. After that, we can concentrate on public service. What's this? What's he talking? What did our leader tell us? Not with actions, but we should win over them with our counter words. I've called you here to discuss an important thing with you. Bezawada rowdy like you is the right person to deal with... ...Kadapa factionists, Bhavani. The strength of my words aren't hitting enough to those people of Kadapa. We have to deal with them in their very manner. I have an idea. We shall kill one of our men, create a fake witness and frame the CM for that. How is the idea? Stop! Hey, what's the progress? Hey... The murder which are getting it done should be highly confidential. Ensure that you arrange fool-proof witness and see to that the CM gets the entire blame. Call me after the task gets finished. [indistinct temple bell rings] [tyres screech] [clamour] "O daughter of the mountain god, by whose presence the world is filled with joy" "For whom the whole world is a divine play and who is praised by Nandi" [water rustles] "Oh goddess who is the consort of the one with the blue throat (Lord Shiva)" "One who is related to the entire universe and who is the creator of abundance" [tyres screech] "Hail destroyer of demon Mahishasura" [panting] -"Hail destroyer of demon Mahishasura" [men shouting] "Hail to the one with shining locks of hair" "Hail destroyer of demon Mahishasura" [panting] [tyres screech] [panting] "O daughter of the mountain god, by whose presence the world is filled with joy" "For whom the whole world is a divine play and who is praised by Nandi" [slits] [groans] "Oh goddess who is the consort of the one with the blue throat (Lord Shiva)" "One who is related to the entire universe and who is the creator of abundance" [groans] "Hail destroyer of demon Mahishasura" "Hail destroyer of demon Mahishasura" "Hail to the one with shining locks of hair" "Hail destroyer of demon Mahishasura" In the broad daylight at the 12 pm at the heart of Vijayawada city, Benz centre, with hundreds of people watching, the TDP leader and the close associate of ex-CM of Andhra Pradesh, Dayaneni Rama was brutally murdered and this incident put the entire state in jitters. Even when no one knows who is behind this murder, the opposition ranted that it was the work of incumbent government. Not only that, the people of Obulu Reddy's caste and Gangaveeti Bhavani's caste have begun to act rather than exchanging words. "If words fail to finish the task, the hands would take hold of it" "If hands fail to finish the task, the swords would come into picture" "When swords fail, the guns would be used" "When the bullets of the gun aren't sufficient, the bombs will explode" "If words fail to finish the task, the hands would take hold of it" "If hands fail to finish the task, the swords would come into picture" "When swords fail, the guns would be used" "When the bullets of the gun aren't sufficient, the bombs will explode" "When the bullets of the gun aren't sufficient, the bombs will explode" "The entire history has been repeated" "When the bullets of the gun aren't sufficient, the bombs will explode" "The entire history has been repeated" "Mind it... Mind it!" "Mind it... Mind it!" [gun fires] "Mind it... Mind it!" [tyres screech] "When you won't follow as told," "you'd certainly face death" "When you don't bow your head to the power," "you'd be beheaded" "Know this and move accordingly" "Escape death and be alive" "This truth would be repeated" "The entire history has been repeated" "This truth would be repeated" "The entire history has been repeated" "Mind it!" "Mind it!" "Mind it!" "Yeah... Yeah... Yeah..." "Run for your lives if you want to live" [stabs] "Living and dying in blood" "Living in the thirst of blood" "Facing python with a mere stick is a foolish thing" "Hitting a tiger with footwear is insanity" "Know this and move accordingly" [explosion] "Escape death and be alive" "This truth would be repeated" "The entire history has been repeated" "This truth would be repeated" -"The entire history has been repeated" -Officers... In the last five weeks, this is the seventeenth murder in the state. After this murder, there have been several murders around Vijayawada which are still unaccounted. The people are terrified even to enter into the capital city. We are mainly suspecting Kadapa's Obul Reddy and Bezawada's Gangaveeti. But they are currently in underground. I won't be questioning anyomore. I'll act. I'll act for sure. We thought rowdyism has been exterminated in Vijayawada. That's true. But rowdyism got exterminated and gave birth to factions. Everyone is weeping. Don't you understand? You might celebrate today as you've won. But tomorrow, I'll take everyone to task. I'll make each of you sit, break your limbs and whip you! [applause] [no voice] [music mutes voice] Instead of running the state by taking the lead as the CM, [cameras click] would he kill people? What kind of politics is this? All I say is this, Law and order became immaterial in Andhra Pradesh. AP became the state with the highest number of murders. I have only question for the central government. Revoke the incumbent government. Conduct by-elections. Given the current circumstances, The only one who can save AP, and take it forward is the Velugu Desam Party. [applause] [music mutes voice] "They've started CBI probe" "They'd torture mentally and bring out the truth" "New war... This is a new war" "The lapdog media and cunning anchors" "would trap him in a scam by telecasting insane scenes" "There are no swords and blood splatter now" "The methods of waging war has been changed now" "A citizen is a king only till he votes" Why aren't you responding to the turmoil happening in the state? Since Dayaneni Rama is an opposition candidate, are you trying to sidetrack the case? No person involved in Dayaneni's murder case will be spared. As accused by former chief minister, be it my men or whoever it is. It's on me that I'd see them get punishment lawfully. I'll arrange SIT team to probe this case and hand this over to the bureaucrats. [siren wailing] [music mutes voice] To unravel the mystery behind Dayaneni Rama's murder, a renowned officer who's been very knowledgeable about crime, has been appointed as the chief officer of Special Investigation Team (SIT). -Madam... -Madam, did you find any clues? Madam, how are you going to investigate this case? As per standard investigation procedure. Madam, did you find any clues? Yeah. We've found a very important clue. Overlap of voices: What is it, madam? Tell us... Tell us... It is nothing but Dayaneni Rama's dead body. What's your next plan of action, madam? Umm... I'll think about post lunch. -Thank you very much. -Madam... Madam... One more question... Madam... [clamour] [engine starts] [cameras click] [siren wails] SIT officer Swapna Kumari is like a heroin in the item number. What can she do to me, who is the reigning rowdy of the entire Vijayawada? [laughs] [door creaks open] I'm the nightmare to the rowdies. The item has begun, shall we leave? Hey, what the hell are you talking? [voice unclear] [water rustles] [siren wails] -Move... -Hmm... Move, rascal... Ram Gopal Varma has tweeted again, but he was prasining, this time. -Praising us? -Hmm... Well, what was his tweet? To pervert people like me who considers a woman as a mere sex symbol, you have given a tight-slap by appointing... ...a powerful woman officer Swapna as the SIT officer to probe Dayaneni Rama's murder and I congratulate RCV party for doing that. Huh! No one knows when and whose side that bugger Ram Gopal Varma takes. Don't trust him. Everyone thinks 'changing sides' is done only by politicians. But Ram Gopal Varma was born with this quality. Sometimes, he says he is adoring a woman and sometimes, he says she's just a mere sex symbol. We don't understand if he is praising or chiding. We've already got hell lot of problems. We don't want this to add to our woes. [dials] Forget it. Can I go now? Are you Bezawada's rowdy? Hmm... Do I look a heroine in the item number? Hmm... I'm the one who has started rowdyism by discontinuing schooling at 10th division. My brother told me it was a wrong path, hence I've entered the film industry. Remember something. I'm not new to Rowdyism. Well... Do you think I'll get terrified by you? Women have applied warrior tilak on my forehead and sent me here. Why will I get scared by you? Your... police might fail... Your government might fail. Law... Even law might fail... But I won't fail. This is my warning to all of you. This is my warning to everyone who does rowdyism. If you try to do rowdyism from now, I'll strip you and whip you! -People sloganeering: Jai VDP -We've seen their faction history till now But now, we're seeing their faction politics. He came to our place, he made his men do this murder and set up an enquiry committe to probe it. He's our party worker who is very naive. Gangaveeti Bhavani is a very good man that he joined in our party despite knowing that we're behind his father Gangaveeti Ganga's murder. Mr Chinna Babu, you shouldn't talk about such things. -Oh damn! -You might be thinking that we'll stay mum if you abuse your power on these innocent people. They still don't know what kind of a person my father is. "He can take it if you slap him" "He can withstand it if you kick him in his loins" "He can take it if you slap him" "He can withstand it if you kick him in his loins" "But if you mess with his ego" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..." -"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..." "He can take it if you slap him" "He can withstand it if you kick him in his loins" "He'll kill you... He'll kill you... He'll kill you..." "Oh no! He'll kill you... Oh no! He'll kill you..." "When a guy younger than him is making fun of him" "and his several years of experience" "When he's getting taunted by unexpected things" "and dirt is thrown on him" "He will wait, plot a sketch" "and wait for right time to back-stab" "He prays to God to bless him with a day where he digs ditch" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..." -"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..." "When he gets a humiliating defeat" "When he is made to sweat and run" "When all his hopes to lay hands on the money are made to shatter" "When his very own people ditch him" "He will plot a plan. He'll come up with a scheme" "He lays a trap with his unbelievable moves" "He'll make a map to annihilate all his enemies" "till the last remaining person of their family" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you!" -"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..." -"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..." I've never seen or heard of this kind tawdry politics in the last 127 years. Stooping to low level of politics! People and democracy have become like cheap things to this government. They're considering it as a joke. I have only one thing. The CM failed to nab the culprits in Dayaneni Rama's murder case. He has to resign immediately. Otherwise... People: You'll strip everyone and whip them. Yes. Madam, what's the status of the probe in Rama's murder? What's the progress of the probe in Rama's murder, madam? In the murder case of Dayaneni Rama, we've suspected Gangaveeti Bhavani, the history sheeter of Bezawada and arrested him. When are you going to present the culprits in front of media, madam? When are you going to present them in front of media, madam? Hmm... But... He has escaped from the police custody last night. Are you playing around? Are you fooling people? SIT became the lapdog of the chief minister. They are cooking up stories citing he has escaped! The truth is that they have killed him by torturing him in the SIT custody and vanished the body. I won't spare the government, and the police as well. [music mutes voice] They claim that it is you who has got Gangaveeti Bhavani murdered in the SIT custody and vanished the body. What's your say on this? My history tell us what we are. Though my grandfather got murdered in the faction mess, my father told us to refrain from the vengeance which everyone knows. We have the habit of doing anything in a straight forward manner. When that's how we do things, how do you think that we had vanished the body? Can there be any other insane accusation other than this? [music mutes voice] Where is Obulu? I doubt that he's been to a holiday along with his family. Obulu has a family? I doubt it. Err... I mean I doubt that he has a family. About all the sensational incidents that had happened and has been happening, veteran analyser of politics, Professor Durgeshwar Rao will explain us detailedly. Sir... Mr Durgeshwar Rao... [inhales] Now... Regarding Dayaneni Rama's murder, though the ex-CM Mr Babu is not behind it, I can analyse for sure that he is passively involved. Footprints are more dangerous than fingerprints is what a primitive had said some thousands of years ago. Not only that, a jobless man from Peddapuram told that an idle cycle peddled on its own. If we put aside my analysis and think as per common man's sense, the VDP party's conspiracy behind this case is that they want to backstab RCV party. Is this true? This is my analysis for today. It might change tomorrow. Brother... Well... Did Bhavani escape or did they kill him? How would I know when you don't know, brother? Why would I ask you I know about it? Don't you know that I won't be knowing when you don't know and how would I know that you don't know, brother? [laughs] When things are happening in that way... To give away sensational truths about Rama's murder, an unexpected world-famous person has come from America. He is the leader of peace mission. "I'm P.P Jaul" "I'm P.P Jaul" "P... P... P... Jaul... Jaul..." "P... P... P... Jaul... Jaul..." "I'll show my awsomeness" "I'm P.P Jaul" "Military is terrified by me" "Even God gets jitters by me" "I'm P.P Jaul" "I'm P.P Jaul" "I'll show my awesomeness" Mine is international thinking. Minions like Jagannath, Babu, RCR Pranav Kalyan aren't my rivals. Next, Delhi is my target. In 2024, that seat would be mine. Not just one or two, but there would be prime ministers of 155 countries would attend my oath ceremony, along with their family. "I've stopped the war against Pakistan" "with a phone call" "It's me who has stopped the third world war" "I've killed Bin Laden with a wink" "I've tipped Bush about the" "hideout of Saddam Hussain" "It's me... It's me... It's me..." "Me... Me... Me... It's me..." "I'm P.P Jaul" "I'm P.P Jaul" "I'll show my awesomeness" "I'm P.P Jaul" Forget about Aadhar card... If I win the elections, I'll introduce one smart card for everything. It will be called as P.P. Jaul card. There'll be no Visas and passports or ATM's. There will be one card for everything and it dispenses everything at free of cost. If I win the election, there won't be traffic jams anymore. There'd be only helicopter jams in the sky. "P... P... P... Jaul... Jaul..." "P... P... P... Jaul... Jaul..." "Aishwarya and Deepika chased me" "asking me to marry them" "I've pitied on Abhishek and Ranveer," "So, I've turned down their proposal" "The entire nation asked me" "to become their leader" "So, I've turned down... I've turned down... I've turned down..." "I've turned down... I've turned down... I've turned down their proposal" "For AB" "For AB" "For AB..." Who do you think murdered Dayaneni Rama and who might have got done this? Jesus revealed me the murderer of the Dayaneni Rama. 1000 out 100 percent, it is none than the former chief minister, who has killed him. We are here. I will say you something. You won't get it wrong, right? Ask me openly. Do you have a chip or is it gone? Dayaneni Rama was very close associate of Mr Babu. To be more frank, he is like his heart. When that's the case, why would Babu kill Rama? Good question. I have been to 143 countries. Prime ministers of more than 50 countries have taken my blessings. [music mutes voice] They are my disciples, my devotees. If I give a single missed call, they would come here on helicopters. When I'm such an influential person, how can you question me if I'm having a chip? What I have is not a chip, it is a Wifi! That's alright. Let's leave that. What might be Babu's motive behind Rama's murder? What are you talking? Babu came to America not to eat popcorn. He came to seek my blessings. He fell on my feet and ask for mercy. Jesus requested me to forgive those who fall on feet and seek mercy. What? Jesus requested you? Dear Jyothi, am I speaking the truth? Yes, of course. I've immediately called that guy. He told that he was in Los Angeles. Dear Jyothi, is it? -Yeah... -Yeah... Did he land on your home by jumping with a parachute? Don't talk like a mad man! Is your chip gone or what? He didn't jump with a parachute. As there was no airport near my home, I've gone into the sky on a helicopter and explained this to him. He had immediately arranged a meeting in Israel... made Mossad agents wear the attire of Kadapa factionists, made the airforce to drop them in a parachute at Vijayawada Benz circle and got him killed. -Dear Jyothi...-Yes. -Is that it?-Yes... Yes... [radio playing] When I'm looking at the plight of my motherland Andhra Pradesh, I feel pained. I'm unable to look at the woes of my people. Their plight... When I see their plight... I feel very anguished. That's why... That's why I've come to a decision. To go on a train march from Visakhapatnam to Delhi. I will crawl on the parliament like spiderman. And I've also decided to fly from the parliament into the sky like Batman. [rainfall and thunders] The public competely lost trust on our government. You aren't a mere party worker to stay silent. You are the chief minister of this state. What shall I speak? Should I tell them that I don't who is behind this? The perpetrators used vehicles that were registered in Kadapa, our swords and were speaking in our accent. And they've covered their faces with towels. My 10 years of hard work has been ruined with just one swish of a sword. We're in a verge of losing the power which we have earned with 10 years of hard work within 10 months. My fear is not about losing power. I'm worried about losing the trust of people. If it is the work of our men, the people would hit at us with footwear. Call to our hometown and enquire where they were at the time of murder. Tell them not to leave the town till I tell them. Hmm... This twist is right. Why should we care about what happens to the political leaders? [clinks] If we join our hands, we'll prosper. -Cheers. -Cheers. -People sloganeering: Hail VDP! -In Dayaneni Rama's murder case, we don't trust SIT officer's probe. The SIT officers and the CM who got Gangaveeti Bhavani murdered joined hands together and are ensuring that Obul Reddy is not traceable. My question to the central government is that, they should appoint CBI to investigate this case. CBI investigation is necessary for this case. Babu's government toppled. If we topple the present chief minister, our party flag would be flying in the next Andhra elections. It is difficult for the people to trust the regional parties in this situation. Arrange for the press meeting. [camera clicks] Greetings. Despite choosing this government by the people of Andhra Pradesh with a lot of trust, the CM and his government have breached their trust within three months. They have become a joke before the public. They've ruined democracy. My friends from Andhra Pradesh... I'm with you all. Don't be scared. I'm about to announce Presidential rule in Andhra Pradesh. Interim elections would be declared. I'm handing over the Rama murder case to CBI. That guy RGV's latest tweet from Mumbai. You've fired a beautiful lady like Swapna Kumari. It's okay, it happens sometimes. But you should've assigned someone more beautiful from the CBI. This is my request to the government. The entire state is on fire about this case... but this guy is just stuck at the beauty of ladies. Well, he is a man who adores beauty! Enough, we too know how to. -Yeah... -Of course! Andhra Pradesh is hot with serial murders... the government hasn't responded in anyway, thought everyone is waiting for it. In the murder case of Dayaneni Rama... Chief Minister Jagannatha Reddy is being accused as the prime suspect. The opposition is demanding his answer for this now. -Wait please! -Wait! [indistinctive chatter] [cameras clicking] [public clamouring] What is this? Do you need any other proof, to say the the government has destroyed the democracy? We are asking just one thing to the police... please revive the law. And work as per law. with this blow, the chief minister must go behind the bars again. [Bollywood song being played] Jyothi... Jyothi... Damn you Jyothi! As they say, one cannot escape his misfortune, no matter where he goes... Unnecessarily, I threw a pebble in a puddle! This is the effect of it. Damn! Why do you think so? You have created a sympathy for yourself in public now -Hmm? -Hmm? -Is it? -Yes Then, take the list. And call them. 28 lakhs for MLA, 50 lakhs for MP. no, make it 60 lakhs. Ok? Party activist, Rs 1 Lakh. Okay? You please arrange for the press meet immediately. I am the peace God, who prays for the peace of all the nations in the world I myself do not have any security. Are we staying in Bejawada or are we staying in Rayalaseema? Within 5 hours of the incident of the murder I have given a statement saying that Babu has done all of this. Do they immediately attack on me? Even in America I have never faced such an incident. We are competing in the elections. 1000% I will need all your support for that. You will have it sir [in unison] -Will you extend your support? -We will. -Each of you should bring in 100 members. -Sure sir. -Will you? -Yes sir. [throwing flying kisses] Why, do I alone have to give you kisses? Don't you know you have to give them in return? [throwing flying kisses in unison] Rambabu what are you doing? BEFORE THE MIDTTERM ELECTIONS Do we really need such politics? We don't need. We don't need such nasty politics. That's why I tell you this... Remove Babu! Save Andhra! -Remove! -Babu! [in unison] -Save -Andhra! [in unison] Janasena will win this! And teach a lesson to everyone. Jai Hind! In the forth coming days, we shall build Amaravathi in Andhra Pradesh and make it stand out on the globally. You chose him in the previous elections... and made a mistake. Now vote for me to correct your mistake. [crowd cheering] Soothsayer Bramham told somewhere in BC that truth will be known with patience. I'm telling you now, You have the capability, and intelligence to grasp that truth and I strongly believe you will choose the right leader. ['Kudi edamaithe' from Telugu film Devadasu being played] [inaudible conversations] [inaudible conversations continue] I, China Babu as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, will uphold the sovereignty... What is it? Milk. -Did you add sugar? -Hmm! It's very sweet. I have learnt the chief minister's oath by heart, would you like to listen? Hmm. I, China Babu as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, will uphold the sovereignty of India... [dogs bark] that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India that I will bear true... faith... and obedience I will not show any fear, partiality... and hatred... I will consentiously... -conscientiously... -conscientiously... dischar... discharge my duties. I swear in the name of God. I, China Babu Andhra Pradesh... Ah? Ah Ok! I, China Babu as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, [phone ringing] [snoring] -My dear officer... -Sir... I know who did the murder of Dayaneni Rama. -Listen to me carefully. -Yes. [inaudible conversation] Yes sir. Yes sir. Do you get it? Under any circumstances, this news shouldn't be exposed. Ok sir. In the murder case of Dayaneni Rama... we now came to know the main accused. [ reporters clamouring] Who is it sir? We were mistaken to say that Obul Reddy lone got Dayaneni Rama killed the person who is behind this murder is the ex-chief minister's daughter-in-law The wife of China Babu CM candidate of Velugudesam in forth coming elections Ramani! Bhavani, it is better to kill Rama instead of someone else. Because he is well noted to the people in the media. After the shocking news of Gun Ramesh has accused Ramani... for the murder of Dayaneni Rama The much shocking news broke out that Ramani and Akash Babu have left for London and... that they were staying in a house in the same lane where Vijay Mallya stayed. But when our representative spoke to them, They said that they came to London just for the shopping. Amidst these confusing and chaotic twists... and in these political chaos where no one knows what id the truth and what is not Where no one knows what happened or what did not happen... Where no one has no clue what is happening... But what are people actually believing... Will be known only after these midterm elections. Your Rambabu, along with cameraman Manga. AFTER MIDTERM ELECTIONS. [crowd cheering] I, PP John. as the third chief minister of Andhra Pradesh taking an oath. As the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, the first sign I do is, that from here after... there will be no elections once in 5 years. The next elections will be only after I go to Jesus. When? Only after I go Jesus. God bless you! Argh! Was that a dream? There's no swearing ceremony? Are there no prime ministers of 150 countries? The votes that my crores of fans have voted is a dream? Jyothi... Jyothi... Damn, is this a dream? Is this a dream? Is this a dream? I, VS Jagannath Reddy... affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India Putting all this aside, who killed Dayaneni Rama? It's me! Who the hell believes it? [scoffs] Upon the unexpected consequences in the state... let's find out RGV's response. Namasthe RGV sir. RGV sir, if you keep your phone aside we shall start the interview. What is your opinion on these consequences? In a way, I feel... if I look into who all are involved in this scam with no partiality who's behind this murder and all kinds of other crimes involved... without considering them as his kith and kin... he treated all of them equally. without showing any mercy, punishing them without any bias is what I liked the most. Don't you see clearly that you are biased? I already told a lot of times, I am no way in favour of any party. But this is the fact. You witness it. -I mean everyone saw... -Tell me this Ram Gopal Varma sir... Isn't this statement an example to say that you are in favour of that party? No because, you just saw... in fact we all saw... after the midterm election results... Jagannath party has secured 151+23, 174 seats. The whole Andhra Pradesh have a lot of faith on Jagannath. There is no better proof than this. Isn't it? Say don't say I am in favour of that party, The whole Andhra Pradesh people spoke in favour of him. The way he handled this scam, proved his integrity. The whole nation is talking about it. Moreover, a party securing 174 out of 175 seats... has never ever happened in world history. But there's something surprising here that... they secured 174 seats but Babu winning one seat is noteworthy. But I feel that, Babu is involved in Rama's murder. How can you affirm that Babu is involved in it Mr RGV? I didn't finish it. Though there are rumours that Babu is involved... I think that we should think that the public think... that it happened without Babu's knowledge. Here is where I get confused... Who do you think has murdered Rama? I opine that the secrets behind Rama's murder... will never ever be known to anyone. Because... No one ever knows the final solution to the happenings in politics. It just flows with time. But coming to that point... the public lack the interest to know the truth behind these and rather find it interesting to discuss them in drawing rooms in the cities... and under the trees if villages They will have big discussions with their little brains. They feel great about themselves and find happiness in that. No matter what anyone says or tells or analyses The one real truth which all have to accept is whether in politics or cinema or media or anywhere for that matter... All that people want is just entertainment.
