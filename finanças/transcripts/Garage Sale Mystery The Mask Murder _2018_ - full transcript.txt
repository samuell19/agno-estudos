Carmen, can you check that the back door is latching properly, please? Yeah. No problem. I have to grab something in the back anyway. See you tomorrow. Bye. Please stop calling. Look... It's been over for a while now, okay? Please move on. You're a good guy. Just... Not for me. Okay? Shh. You hear that? Silence is golden. Logan is sleeping in. Hannah is at the dorm. It took us a long time to get here. Oh, but it was worth the wait. I'm late! Whoa, hey, you don't have school today, buddy. Yeah, I know, but they're releasing the new astro freefall comic at the emporium, so. Help yourself. Logan, I can make more... no time. Thanks. Love you. See you later! Love you, too. Okay. Where were we? "Silence is golden." I thought I smelled breakfast. Um, I can make more. No. That's okay. I kind of already ate. Dad... Yeah? I need your help. Uh, sure, but I thought you were staying at the dorm. Well, I was, but I'm in crisis mode and here to recruit you. For? We're one of four sororities entered into a tiny house building contest. It's for charity. What's tiny house? It's an initiative to help the homeless. A benefactor has donated land, and it's going to be a community, where they can get shelter and have their own safe place. Well, it sounds like a great idea. Great, so where do I fit into this? Well, we're short a person, because several of the girls have a final that day, and I figured a genius like yourself could really help us take home the trophy this year. Genius? I like that. So you're doing this for charity or for a trophy? Well, charity first, of course. And I'm assuming you want to beat the kappas? They beat us every year at all these events. It is our turn to win for once. So what exactly are the guidelines? Four teams of five people will each build one tiny house. The first sorority to build a house and pass a safety inspection wins. - Interesting. - Mm-hmm. So how big is this trophy? Jason. Come on. But everyone wins in the end. There will be a big dedication ceremony and four new places for people to call home. When do you start? Tomorrow. That is if I can borrow dad? You don't need to ask her permission. Honey, can I go? Have fun. - Thanks. - Great. We'll brainstorm tonight. Awesome. Oh, sorry. Did I interrupt? - No. - All yours. Good. Help yourself. You're the best. - Well, we can make more. - No, I don't have time. I have to pick up Dani for an auction and if I don't leave now, I'll be late. Oh, do you hear that? The silence is only golden if I spend it with you. I'll make it up to you tonight. - Promise? - Yes. Can you lock the doors? I'll lock 'em. Thank you. So is there anything you're hoping to find? Oh, yes. I'm hoping there's a random locker filled with Frank Guttierez paintings. I remember that. Those went for $300,000 off that locker buy. Those are the ones. As I do recall, though, they had to spend a little more money on that locker. I see where you're going. Okay. Fine. But within reason. That's the auction day spirit. Please. It's all I've got left. Look, the rarities I have in there are worth more than anything you're going to get at auction. - Mr. Zetto, I understand... - No! No, you don't. Now, look, please. Let me into my locker, and I can sell some of the stuff from my store. If I get paid, then you get paid. Don't let me in, you won't get any type of payment from me. And I let you in, you take out the only things of real value, you sell them, and I never see you again. I wouldn't do that. I don't know that. The bottom line is you are behind on your payments, way behind. I have been through this all with you before. I'm sorry, but I have a business to run. Yeah? So did I. This isn't over! Sorry about that. That's okay. Um... We're here for the auction. Uh... oh, yeah! Through the door, up one flight of stairs. Have fun. Bye-bye. Take a good look. All right, shall we start the bidding at... $100. Do I hear $100? Do I have $100? I need $100. I've got $100. Do I have two? $100. I've got two. I've got $200 here. I've got $300 here. Do I have 350? Whoa! $500. We've got a big spender. We have $500. Do I have 550? We have $500. Do I have 550? Going once. $500. Going twice. Sold to the gentleman in the yellow hat. Moving on. Now, of course, no touching, but this next locker sure seems promising. Everyone, take a look. Wow. Looks like a lot of collectibles. Yeah, unique ones, too. Yeah. All right, are we ready? Shall I suggest we start the bidding at $100. I've got $100. I've got $100. Do I have two? I've got $200. $200. $200. $200... Do I have three? - $300. - Is it worth that? - I think it's worth more. 300... I've got $350. Do I have four? 400! I've got $400. $400. $400. $400. Do I have 450? I've got $450. - 600. - What? Where's your auction day spirit? But 600? Remember the Guttierez paintings? Okay. ...do I have 650? $600. Going once. $600. Going twice. Sold to the two lovely ladies! Yay. I so do love auction day. Moving on! Okay, ladies, congratulations. You are the proud owner of 2206. I think... here we go. I think you're going to like this. Now, do you have your own padlocks, or do you want to use ours? Yours are fine. Yeah. All right... Ta-dah! Okay. This key here... this is the key to the locker. Fyi, $20 replacement fee for any keys lost. And you can return these keys once you're done clearing it out. - Great. - Okay. - These are yours. - Thank you. Congratulations. Ooh! Also, I can be reached pretty much any time at this number here if you have any problems. Any questions? Thank you, Michelle. I'm good. All right. All yours. Have fun. Thanks. Thanks. Old soda crates. That's $200 right there. Ooh, Dani, look. Upside-down Mason jars from the early 1900s. I think they only made these for about 10 years. What are they worth? I've seen them go for $1000 apiece. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Oh, wow. This locker's already paid for itself. And then some. Jenn, I'm seeing a lot of price tags on these things. Yeah. I'm noticing that, too. It's almost like it's someone's inventory. A store of unique rarities for sure. I hope it's not that guy we saw out front. He did mention something about having a shop. Oh, gosh, I would feel so bad if this was all his stuff. - Typewriter! - A what? Wow. - Look at this. - This is interesting. What's that? Come on! Oh, sorry. Wow. Is it plaster? I think it is. "La belle Italienne"? "The beautiful Italian." And that she is. Gosh, I can't believe how much stuff is actually in this locker. Yeah, it'll take us a couple of trips to get it back to the store. You're right. I will go get the car and move it a little bit closer. - We did well. - Yeah. It's going to be a good month. It is! You're a smart lady, partner. I think one more trip to the storage facility should do it. Is that the box of plaster masks? Yes, it is. Let's see what we can find out about plaster masks. Wow. 2.7 million results for plaster masks. Huh. Well, wait, there's a name on the back. Do you know anyone named Giorgione? I do not. Okay, well, how about the other one? La belle Italienne, right? - That's it. - Okay. Oh, I think I found something. What did you find? Well... It says, "la belle Italienne was a beautiful unknown woman found dead and smiling in Paris' river seine back in the 1880s." "Thought to have drowned either by suicide or murder. No family ever came to claim her." Her case never solved. Interesting. Why would a dead person be smiling? I guess that's part of the mystery. Says she became known as "the drowned Mona Lisa." "The undertaker was so moved by her beauty, he made a plaster mold of her face to immortalize her." Wait a minute... This mask was on a dead person? Oh, no, no. This is a replica. There are thousands of these. What about the other masks? Oh, uh... - Giorgione, right? - Uh-huh. Let's see... Huh. It says that Giorgione was a painter and he died 370 years earlier. Which means? Dani... These are death-masks. That's not creepy at all. So, how much do the replicas go for? Well... $250 apiece. Our good month just became a great month. Now, this is even more interesting. Do you remember Drew? He worked at the audio store. He helped with the therapist's murder case? Oh, yes. The guy you went out with in high school? Yeah. Well, he's back in town and he asked me to go by his store this afternoon. Mm. Are you going to go? I don't know, because you and I have to go back to the storage facility for that last load. Oh, Dani, it's so close. I can do it myself. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Go have fun. Okay, good, because I need to go home and freshen up before I go. I'll be back later if you need me. Okay. What are you guys up to? Getting a game plan together for the tiny house build tomorrow. How tiny are these houses anyway? Tiny. Basically the size of a small bedroom... eight feet by twelve feet. Mm-hmm. Can fit a family of three snugly. How long do you have to build? Two days. With proper planning, we'll get it done even faster. I can smell the trophy already. But we are doing this for charity, right? - Absolutely. - Perfect. We just have to be better and faster than the other teams. Look, all I'm saying is that we need to be careful. We have been. I don't see what the problem is. You want to get paid? Yes, of course, I... Hi there. Um, hi. How's everything working out for you? Is there anything I can do? Everything is great, thank you. Good. You know what... There's another locker going up for auction from the same owner. Maybe you want to take a look? Get in an early bid? Sure. If it's no trouble? None at all. Follow me. If you don't mind me asking, who did these lockers belong to? Oh, make me an offer and they're both yours. No, I meant originally. When I first came here, there was a man talking about rarities, and what I found inside fits the bill. I'm sorry, we don't give out that kind of client information. I understand. Hang on a second. I'm sorry, I need to take this call. I'm going to give you these keys. 2230. It's a locker right around the corner. Why don't you take a look? Let me know if you're interested. See what you think. I will. Thank you. Okay. Her name was Carmen Day. The locker was registered to a Lawrence Zetto. She was a lovely girl. I didn't know her that well. She didn't work here that long, but she was a very sweet girl. She worked really hard. She was going to night school. I'm sorry, I'm just so surprised. I'm so shocked. You must see this kind of thing all the time, officer, but I don't. Frank. Should I even ask why you're here? I won a bid on a locker at auction, and I was looking at a second locker by the same owner, and when we opened the door... There was the body. It's an employee here. Her name is Carmen. She didn't show up for work today. Okay, well... I should probably get inside. I'll go with you. When Dani and I showed up, there was a very angry man yelling about valuables in a locker, that he didn't want sold. Frank, this is the picture of the man, right there in front of that store. Okay... That's the man whose locker I got at auction. He said, "this isn't over yet," and then he stormed out. So you're implying that his anger manifested into killing an employee because she was selling his stuff? Might have. Well, your "might haves" usually mean something else. Well, I also might have seen the manager of the storage facility in a heated discussion with someone, but I couldn't see the guy's face. However, he was wearing very specific gloves... maybe a tradesperson. That might be a connection, too. Might be. It doesn't look like she's been there very long. Frank... Hmm? Some of her press-on nails have fallen off. Maybe there was a struggle. Yeah, but her nails could've fallen off at any time before the incident happened. With that contusion, looks like she may have tripped and smacked her head on the table with the full weight of her body. That's a pretty aggressive hit on the head for just a fall? But I'm going to go. - Mm-hmm. - And let you handle it. Okay. Don't worry. We're going to start there. - Right. - Right. - I'll call you later. - Yeah. Okay. - Hey, hon'. - Hi, Jenn. How's your day? Oh... eventful. "Eventful"? What does that mean? Well, a body was in the locker that I was looking to buy. What? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Who was it? Well, it was an employee of the facility. She fell and she hit her head. It looks like an accident. So far. So far? Look, I'm not getting involved. You're sure? Yes. I'm headed back to work. All is well. How come I don't believe you? No, really. I'm headed back to work. That's not what I meant. I know. Sweetie... Let the police do their job. I will. - Love you. - I love you, too. Detective. Is there anything I can help you with? Actually, I was going over your statement again. And I just can't figure out why Carmen punched her time card after she finished her shift. Does she go back to work again? Well, I'd asked her to check the latch on the back door. It had been sticking all day. It wasn't closing fully, so I figured that she checked it and left out the back. You didn't hear or see anything after that? I didn't. And there was no one else on the premises? Nope. Mind if I take a look at your security footage? Sure. Okay. This is it? - Yeah, right here. - All right. Okay. All right. Stop. What? Stop why? Where? There was a glitch there. Just play it again? Yeah, um, sometimes, the feed gets interrupted for a second or two. It's just a connection issue. Okay. May I? Please do. It was only just for a few seconds? Just a feed issue, I guess. Okay, well, if you look at the clock behind you before the glitch... And after the glitch... That's definitely more than a few seconds. It's more like almost an hour. Really? Mm-hmm. Well, I will get that fixed. Can I see the security footage for the hallway by the backdoor? Again, there's a glitch. What an odd time for it to turn off, wouldn't you say? I would. It's almost as if someone is pressing stop, and then turning it back on again an hour later. Well, I will get that repaired ASAP. Hmm. All right, tell me about the locker owner, Mr. Zetto. I heard he was in here earlier and he was pretty mad. He sure was. He was here yesterday, too, asking for another extension... but I'd already given him two. He even got Carmen to plead his case. Why would she plead his case? She was a heart on the sleeve type. She befriended him a while back. Spent some time at his antique store. Really? Really. Oh, and he was so angry at me earlier. Take a look at this. I mean, I wanted to help him, but I'm trying to run a business here. This Mr. Zetto, he owned a store, and he left his stuff here? "Owned," past tense. Went out of business. And, yes, he did keep his inventory here. Can you tell me how to get ahold of Mr. Zetto? Dani... Hi. - It's good to see you. - You too. Oh, I've got something you've got to see. Those are the kind of tapes we used in A.V. Club. Exactly the same tapes. No? Yes. Oh... no. Yeah. It's us rehearsing lines for that short film that we wrote. Yeah, I found it in my garage. Oh, but we don't have to watch it. No, it's not that bad, really. That's the great thing about the future. It could go anywhere and everywhere. Oh, my goodness. Sorry. Sorry! That was a good one. Wow, that was really embarrassing. What? No. You were amazing. "Anywhere and everywhere" is a great closing line. We were a good team. We were. Look, I'm... I know we lost touch after the reel-to-reel case. But now that I'm back, um... Maybe I could... Maybe sometime... Make you dinner? Well, as long as you promise not to bring that tape or any others like it? If it gets me a first date, I won't bring it. Deal. I'm yours. It... it's yours. That's what I meant. Call me. I will. Hey, how did it go with Drew? It was great, he wants to make me dinner, but I just ran into Frank on the way back from the storage facility. Are you okay? Well, it's not how I would plan my day to go, but, yeah, I'm fine. You were there looking at a second locker or something? Yes, and get this... the locker was owned by the same gentleman. So, is it a coincidence that we found a box full of death-masks and an actual body? Do you think there's a connection between the masks and the body? I don't know, but I'm going to see if those dots connect. So is it safe to assume that our new locker inventory is now evidence for Frank? Well, Carmen's death hasn't been ruled a murder yet, so, technically, this stuff is still ours. Yet? You're thinking on motives, aren't you? Well, there were a lot of antiques in both those lockers. I could see an owner getting mad if they were sold. Mad enough to kill someone? Well, I don't know, it's a lot to lose. And then there was the storage manager... I got the feeling that she was hiding something. Okay, this is the part where I say let Frank handle it, right? Oh, and this is the part where I say okay, because... I'm not getting involved this time. What? I'm not. Really. Promise. Okay. Okay, good. Oh... What? Dani... This mask... It looks like the girl I found today. Oh, no. Hey, honey. Hi. Hi. Ooh... You hear that? Ah, yes. The sweet sound of silence. Besides your laughter, my favorite sound. To us. And the quiet times. Check it out! Limited edition astro freefall. Oh. How is it? Oh, I'm not reading it. The oils from your fingers, they ruin the pages, but I have been reading the e-version online. To answer your question... Epic... - Epic. - Epic. Dad! Are you ready for the tiny house build tomorrow? I am more than ready. Good. Oh! Welcome to grand central station. During rush hour. Evening, all. Brett, how are you? Great. Busy at the station, as you know, but it has helped me work up an appetite. Actually, we should get going, so we're not late again. Officer Ryan here always has to drive the speed limit. Well, it is the law and all. You guys, have fun. Yeah. Be back later. Have a great night. You too. You too. Ah... Where were we? I think right about here. You've gotta be kidding me. Epic. What are you watching? How to make a plaster mask. Oh, like the death-masks? Same method minus the dead body. Do you think the mask in the store is really from the body you found? If not, it's really close. Does Frank have any leads or any ideas as to who might have done this? Well, Lawrence Zetto owned both storage lockers, sold death-masks at his store, and has quite the temper. So what happened to you staying out of this? I'm just watching a video. About mask making. Here at home. Right by you. Everybody's safe. Just don't stay up too late. I won't. - Love you. - Love you. Uncanny. Petechial hemorrhaging present in the conjunctival surfaces of the eyes. I smell coffee, but not the usual macchiato, so either it's not Jenn Shannon or thanks a latte is closed. They were closed. But the gas station has really stepped up its coffee game. How are you? Sadly, autopsy is a dying practice. Funny. I still remember what my grandfather said to me before he kicked the bucket... What was that? He said... "How far do you think I can kick this bucket?" Oh, boy. How can I help you? Carmen Day. You know I can't share any of her results. I do, but I thought we could talk coulds, possibilities, and what ifs? Possibilities will work. Could Carmen's death possibly be something other than an accident? Possibly, but the head trauma on the anterior of the skull on first inspection is consistent with an accident. And on second inspection? Now possibly, there could be secondary bruising and minor lacerations on her shoulder blades. Which wouldn't be there if she only fell forward. So possibly a struggle? Very possibly. The posterior marks are consistent with being struck against a hard surface... Repeatedly. Like a concrete floor or wall? The possibilities are endless. Judging by decomposition, her time of death would've been less than a day before she was found. Possibly at the end of her day shift or shortly after? Definitely around that time. Besides the Mark on her back, are there any other odd possibilities? Well, I found minute trace elements of calcium sulphate hemihydrate on her hair follicle. Okay. Well, it's used as a sealant, so it can stick around for months after contact, but what's interesting here is that it has been crystallized. What does that mean? When you warm up it up, the chemical evolves into a dihydrate known as "gypsum." And gypsum is? The chemical name for plaster of Paris, like you would find in an arm or a leg cast... Or a death-mask? Any hardening plaster, really, but... How can you arrive at a death-mask? I opened a locker door. Hey, dad. Yeah? They're the ones to beat. That's kappa? Yep. Okay. So we are here today not just to build houses, but to create homes, and while we will be building only four houses in the next 48 hours, these are but the first of many to come. So let the building... Begin! It's on. Where do we start? Well, my father always used to say, "believe in the magic of new beginnings." He also said, "measure twice, cut once." Ladies, grab a tool belt. Let's get started. Can you pass me a level, please? Oh. OK. Thank you. So the girls and I set up an algorithm app that combines time versus materials versus division of labor, taking into consideration the x factor. I'm not quite sure what you just said, but I like it. We're more of a scholastic sorority. Oh, I'm getting that. Let's hope a little magic can take us a long way. Yeah. What a beautiful spot. That upcoming dinner with Drew sounds promising. Yes, he always seems to show up at just the right time. I'm a big believer in fate. You know you're glowing. It's a new organic day cream. Uh-huh. You're going to jinx it. I'm not going to jinx it! Is this where the memorial is? Yeah, it is. Thank you all for coming. Thanks. This really would have meant a lot to her. My sister, Carmen, was a lot of things to a lot of people. She had the most amazing smile, laugh, these embracing eyes that just always made you feel... Safe. We used to play in this park as kids, never knowing one day that... All of this... Right here... I miss her already. You can't leave her alone even now, huh? I loved her. She dumped you because you cheated on her. She switched schools because you wouldn't leave her alone. You weren't there. I should've been... And you shouldn't be here. Okay. Yeah, fine, okay? I'm gone. Leave him alone. I know what you're thinking. That we may have a suspect. Hey, Frank, sorry I'm late. Hello. What's looking good today? Well, trying to get rid of this dad bod, but not as much as I want pancakes. Oh, you look great. Have the pancakes. All right, done. Don't tell Sally, okay? I've been eating like a savage ever since she's been visiting her mom. Your secret is safe with me. Good. So... I'm probably safe in assuming that you've already chatted with Dr. Tramell? Very safe, and I'm guessing that this is now evidence. Thank you. I just keep asking myself, who makes a death-mask? Well, maybe someone who didn't want to let her go. Well, Carmen and Lawrence Zetto had struck a relationship, and, well, he did sell the masks at his store, so I have officers out trying to look for him now. But what was Zetto's motive? Obsession, maybe? Well, if you're looking at obsession, Carmen had an ex-boyfriend, Grey Baxter. He would not leave her alone after they broke up. She was afraid of him, even changed schools. Already planned on talking to him. What do you know about the manager of the storage facility? Michelle Sarnowsky? Two-strike criminal record. One more, she goes back to jail for good. She's also known to hang around with this guy named Roy Whitaker, who's got his own laundry list of thefts and assault charges. So Sarnowsky would have a locker key to hide the body. And the last to see Carmen alive. Anything on the security cameras? They were conveniently turned off during the time of death... But what's Sarnowsky's motive? Well... Could Carmen have seen something at the facility that someone didn't want her to see? Could have. I'm in the process of gathering surveillance footage from the surrounding businesses. Maybe we'll find something there. So is this officially a homicide? As always... You called it. Dad? According to the app, at this rate of speed, the others will be even further ahead by tomorrow. Quality takes time. Also, we want to make sure the places are safe and sound for the tenants. But is there a way to speed up the quality? Well... The house has to pass a safety inspection to win. You know, some of these places, they're going to be retrofitted after the contest. Your eyes are getting worse. Maybe you should go home. Are you sure? Yes. What's going on? She's having an allergic reaction to the sawdust. I told her she should go. Yeah, you should go home. Take a shower. Get some water on your eyes. We'll be fine here. 'Kay, thanks. You're welcome. Person shortage is going to put us even further behind. Hang on. Where are you going? Calling a ringer. Hey, hon', how's day one? Hey, sweetie... It's not bad. Uh, some of these teams are a lot more competitive than I thought they'd be. We've fallen a bit behind, but we'll catch up tomorrow. I'm sure you will. Uh, don't bother with dinner tonight. I'm going to pick up something on the way home. Hey, is, uh... Is Logan around? Oh, yeah, he's in the other room. Hold on, let me get him. 'Kay. Logan, it's your dad. All right, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Thanks. Hey, dad, what's up? Hey, buddy, what are you up to tomorrow? Not too much. 'Cause we sure could use your help down here at the house build. Me? Dad, I have many skills, but building houses is not one of them. You helped build the mancave. Yeah, barely. You kidding me? Once you got warmed up, you were awesome. Okay, well, if you need me, then yeah, I guess. We definitely need you. We're almost done for the day, but first thing tomorrow morning? All right. Hey! Come in. Thank you. So great that you're here. Mm... Smells good. Uh, yeah, I hope it tastes good. I brought wine. You read my mind. This is really nice. Thanks! Is that the three fates statue from the store? Yeah, I picked it up earlier. I thought it would be fitting for the night. Is... It's too much? No. No, it's perfect. So, what shall we toast to? To old friends. And new possibilities. Smoke. Your oven is... Oh, no... Oh, no. Oh... It's... okay. It's just a little... Burnt? - Blackened. - Annihilated. I think we'd better go out. Well, can we get in anywhere? I think a vending machine would have better food at this point. You know, I never met a bag of chips I didn't like. Hi! Hi. Welcome to Tap 2 Drain Plumbing. How can I help you today? Actually, I just saw a friend of mine come in. Oh, there he is. She's fine. Right this way. I was going to the storage facility, and I saw you walk in here. Oh, and you thought, "well, maybe I'll just pop in and see if Frank will let me look at the security footage?" Well, now that I'm here. Here we go... Wait... Frank, fast forward. Uh, rewind. Just a little bit. What am I looking for here? Wait, stop. Can you zoom in on that hat? Um... Okay, hold on. Frank... The hat says "bax." That's just like the hat that Grey was wearing at Carmen's memorial. "Bax" as in Carmen's ex, Grey Baxter. Which puts him at the facility around the time of the murder. All right, thanks. Patrol car is picking up Grey for questioning. Okay. I'm going to return my keys to the storage facility, but if I hear anything else... I'm sure you will. What's the problem? It just doesn't feel right now. What, now? Well, no, it doesn't feel right, okay? No, this is going to be fine. What, you want to be broke again? You know, I don't want to be broke, but I don't want to go to jail either. No one's going to jail. Look, it's just getting too heated here. Look, do you want the money or not? Yes... I want the money, I'm just saying. Good. You do your job and I'll do mine. Okay, well, the job didn't include a body showing up, all right? Well, it is what it is now. Don't worry, nobody knows anything. But there's a lot of cops around here for nobody knowing anything. It's fine. Is it? You want the money or not? - Jenn? - Hi. How are you? I'm... good, good, I just, I... You know, these lockers all look the same. I must've got turned around. Yeah, you must've, but a lot of people get confused at first. Well, I could see how that would happen. Anyway, I've got to get going. Everything okay? Uh, yes, everything is fine. Hey, I know everybody's all riled up about Carmen, but just let the police handle it. If they could kill Carmen, then they could kill... Well... Any of us. You know, we're both business owners, just trying to do enough to get by, right? Right. So I'm just saying, you know, one woman to another... Be careful. Hmm? Be very careful... Okay? Okay. We good? We are. Great. You have a good day. You too. I will, thanks. Hey. It's looking pretty good so far. Yeah, we just need to speed up dad a touch. He's trying to do everything too perfectly. Yeah, well, that's him. Mm-hmm. Where is he, anyways? I don't know. All set. Dad? Hey, Hannah. Our house is 10 feet this way. Right, but the stud wasn't completely level. I didn't want their house to collapse. Logan, that hard hat looks great on you. Thanks. They're already further along than we are now. That's true, but this is a safety issue. Yeah, we should really get a move on. Okay, you're up to code now. Good luck. Thank you. Wow, theirs looks really good. Yeah, it does. Can we just all look at our own house here, please? Right, we're going to get on it. We're going to pick up the pace, but remember, measure twice, cut once. Remember how to use one of these? Yeah, well, I mean, I built the mancave at home, so... Yep. Uh... womancave. Frank! Jenn, are you okay? Michelle Sarnowsky just threatened me inside the facility. How did she threaten you? Well, it was an implied threat, but she said, "if they could kill Carmen, they could kill any of us." Okay. And she was with a man. They were doing some kind of deal out the back door. He gave her a roll of cash. I recognized his gloves. Same guy she was talking to earlier about money. His landscaping truck said Roy Whitaker. Wasn't that her partner in crime? It sure was. And she definitely didn't want me to see what they were up to. All right. Well, I'll make sure I talk to her after my interrogation of Carmen's ex. Grey is here? He is... And I'm safe in assuming you'd like to watch it? Extremely safe. How long ago was it that you and Carmen broke up again? Four and half, five months. When was the last time you spoke with her? A few weeks ago? Weeks ago? Well then, how come cell phone records indicate that you called her multiple times around the time of her death? Maybe I did. Yeah, that's what I meant. Hmm. Why was she so scared of you? What? Oh, we have several witnesses who say that you were harassing her constantly... Phone calls, texts, all over social media. She even changed schools, right? It was hard getting over her. That doesn't give you any right to harass her. I know... But she stole my heart, and to be honest, I never wanted it back, and I wanted her. I couldn't just walk away. Which is why you went over to her work the day she died, hmm? No. Argument ensued, things got heated. She wouldn't take you back. So you pushed her, maybe too hard, huh? Maybe it was an accident... But you panicked, and you took off. Look, I might've called her, but I was never there. I loved her. Why would I kill her? Autopsy puts her time of death right around that time. That's not me. That's not your hat? Witnesses say they saw you wearing it at the memorial. Yeah, I made them. I gave them out to people over the years... Carmen included. I was at the movies with my girlfriend, Aimee. Girlfriend? That was fast. Yeah. Listen, she's on her way in, okay? You can ask her. Oh, don't worry, I will. Let me ask you about this death-mask. If I put that thing through forensics, am I going to find your DNA all over it? No... That's all Zetto. Lawrence Zetto? The locker owner? Tell me about him. Well, Carmen knew everybody. I know they've talked and stuff. She liked going to his store. Guess they were... Getting chummy. How chummy? Grey? I saw them outside his store, maybe about a week back. You know, just talking, laughing... All that. Do you think he was in love with her? Maybe. Do you think Lawrence Zetto had something to do with her murder? I want to talk to my lawyer. Grey definitely does seem like he was obsessed with Carmen. A crime of passion motive would align more with her injuries. Yeah. Detective Lynwood? We found Lawrence Zetto on a back road off highway 1. Well, tell them to bring him in. All right. Hey, hon', how's the project coming along? Eh, slow... But slow but steady wins the race, right? Everybody wins in this case. Doesn't matter if you come in first. That's true... But I should get going. Can't let Hannah catch me talking on the phone. Oh, she just busted you, didn't she? Yep. Talk to you later. Good luck. Thanks. Kappa's almost done phase one. I know, but... Uh, a little help? Sorry. All right, push it up. We're down... But we're not out. They're about five minutes away from bringing Zetto in, and with the high-end lawyer that Grey's family hired, he's going to walk today if we don't charge him, and we have neither the confession or the hard evidence to do so. What about, uh, Grey's hat from the surveillance footage? Could've been anyone from that angle. We need something way more substantial than that. Can I get you a coffee or something? No, I'm good, thanks. My name's Aimee Lee. My boyfriend, Grey Baxter, wanted me to come in. Okay, I'll just grab the detective for you. Thanks. Um, excuse me? Didn't I see you at Carmen's memorial? You're Grey's girlfriend? Yeah. I am. Look, Grey didn't do this, okay? I've known him since we were, like, 10, and he would never do anything like this. We were at the movies. Ms. Lee? Detective Lynwood. Grey was with me the whole time. Okay, hold on a second. Let me get a written statement. Hold that thought. Uh, hey, officer Ryan? Can you get Ms. Lee a coffee or something? Mr. Zetto, let's go. Looks like you've had a rough few months. Wife gone, apartment gone... Business gone. Yeah. Kind of like a country song, huh? Where were you on the night of the 4th? Uh, I was packing up my car. I'd lost the apartment, so I was heading home to my parents' out east. You know who she is? Uh, I do, yeah. Who is she? Uh, that's Carmen. She works at the storage facility. Do you know that she was found dead in a locker registered under your name? What? No. How? You tell me. Ah, I didn't... I didn't even know. Witnesses say they saw you and her outside your store and even at the storage facility from time to time. Can you explain your relationship? Yeah. We... We were friends. She was interested in the history behind the different things in my store. And you were interested in her? No! No. I mean, she was great and beautiful and sweet, but... I could never do anything like that to her or to anyone. Was Carmen interested in death-masks by chance? Uh... yes, yes, she was. She, uh... She saw my belle Italienne mask, she just... Loved the romance and the mystery behind it. That mystery would be? Uh, well, the story is that belle had been found dead with a smile on her face. Seeing her, the undertaker fell in love with her, and he made the mask. So... You just continued the tradition of the undertaker and made Carmen a death mask of her own? No. Then why is that death-mask exactly like her? Look, I... Hey, and should I mention that we found traces of chemical plaster in her hair? Okay, I know what this looks like, all right? And yes, that's definitely Carmen, but I... Of course, it is. Did you make it? I did, but that's not a death-mask. Okay, how's that? Look, Carmen loved belle's mask. She wanted one of her own, so I made her one this last week, while she was still alive, but then I got pushed out of my space, and I had to move all the rest of my things into the lockers. So... You're telling me this isn't a death-mask, but a living mask? Exactly. I'd told her she could grab the mask from the locker and help herself to anything else she wanted in there. I mean, they weren't... They weren't letting me have any of it. So... So all that plaster that was in her hair was... Took place while you were making the mask? Yes. It's a two-step process. First, you make the negative mold, and then you take the negative to make a positive cast, which she had tried on, which... Could explain why she has remnants in her hair. Did Carmen give you that hat as an exchange for the mask? A friendly exchange? No... And that's not even me. Look, unless you're charging me, I'm walking, but you don't have enough hard evidence for that, do you? So... Tell me... Am I being charged? Not yet. So... What are you thinking? Well, I think Zetto's fingerprints would be all over the locker. And his DNA is probably all over the plaster in her hair. And he doesn't have an alibi. And like you said, he was rather angry at the storage facility. But why does he have a BAX hat on in the security footage? Carmen might've been wearing it the day that she died, or she might have even left it at Zetto's store when he was making the mask for her. Could have. I keep wondering what Sarnowsky is hiding at that facility. Mm. But if I were you right now, I would talk to Grey's girlfriend about that movie ticket she just brought in. Would Grey have time to go to the movies, drop Aimee off, and then head over to the facility and kill Carmen? He would have had to have been driving extremely fast. Obsessively fast. I keep going back to Carmen's profile. Grey has commented at least twice on every photo, and that's months after they broke up. And Grey's admitted to all this. Doesn't necessarily make him a murderer. True... But right now, I don't think Grey or Sarnowsky are telling you the whole story. All right, well, you have my card. We'll be in touch. Thanks. Do you think she's covering for Grey? Well, she could be. Her boyfriend is a prime murder suspect, and like you said, Grey didn't have enough time to drop Aimee off and then head over to the facility. But how does whatever Sarnowsky is doing at the facility tie in to Grey killing his ex-girlfriend? I'm going to find out. I'll see you soon. Yeah. Hey, Jenn. Hey, honey, how's the house coming? We're getting there. Still slow and steady? We've picked up the pace quite a bit, but unfortunately, so have the other team. Well, the good news is, all the tenants are going to love their new homes. Dad! What? Good luck. Thanks. Detective. What can I do for you? Well, I see that your cameras are down. Repairman hasn't shown up yet? Not yet, but they assure me today or tomorrow. What do I owe the pleasure of this visit? You mind if I take a look around? Uh, well, sure, but I believe your guys have already taken the majority of the items out of Mr. Zetto's locker. Then you won't mind if I just take a look in the back. Absolutely. You know what? I have nothing to hide. Hello, Roy. We know all about your little operation here. Let's go. Want to get a bite to eat? Oh, I'm sorry. I already am. Oh... Drew again? Maybe. Where are you going? This old pizza place. We used to go at lunch with friends. Just another little trip down memory Lane. My, this is getting serious. Well, I don't know. The stars do seem to be aligning. How about you? Oh, well, I don't know about aligning, but there's something going on at that storage facility that definitely ties into all of this. There was something off about that manager there. Well, I'd say go with your instincts. They've always worked before. I know, but then there's Carmen's ex, Grey, who was completely obsessed with her, and she was afraid of him. And even though he has an alibi, he still could have had time to see the movie and then drive to the storage facility after. But you need proof. Mm. Okay. Just promise me you'll be careful? I always am. What do you got going on in there, huh? It's a storage facility for, you know, storing. Sure a lot of keys there, huh? You're the key police now? I didn't know there was a limit. My apologies. Listen to me. I may not have the facility's security footage, but I do have it from every other business up and down the block here, and I know for a fact you know that a girl's body was found here the other day. So why don't you save me a lot of hassle and tell me if you were here on the 5th? You're on private property, so unless you have a warrant... I don't need a warrant. I've got more than enough on you guys to bring you down for questioning. Ms. Sarnowsky? You were the last one to see Carmen alive, and you, with all your keys and access to all the different lockers? You easily could've been there that day. So that makes me think, 'cause neither of you are talking, that either you know something about the murder, or you're covering something else up completely. Stop me if I'm getting ahead of myself here. You have nothing. Yeah, but you have access to all those lockers, huh? You better have receipts for every single item in those lockers. So are we going down to the station, or are we going to wrap this up here? He's not a murderer. Michelle! Don't say anything. No, I'm not letting them take you down for that. Why don't we take a little trip down to the station, huh? - Okay, okay. - Okay, watch your head. I'll talk to you later. The early evening show's just started, but it's still probably previews if you want to get in there. Oh, actually, I just have a quick question. Well, my daughter was here the other night, and I think she left her jacket. Did you see her or the jacket? She was here with her boyfriend. She was definitely here. I remember the streak in her hair, and she was in the lobby well into the movie. Hang on. I don't see a jacket. So she wasn't here with her boyfriend? I don't want to get her into trouble. No, no, she's not in trouble. I haven't seen the jacket or the boyfriend. Okay, well, thank you for your time. All right. Nice work ladies. You're close. Real close. What does that mean? It's anyone chance to win. Yes! Hi! I figured you guys could use a pick-me-up. Thank you. You figured right. What can I do to help? Oh, you're so sweet, but we can't have more than five on our team. Okay. Well, it's looking pretty good, though, guys. We're close to finishing phase one. We are really close, really close. Nice work, dad. Uh-oh. All right! Ladies and gentlemen... We have a winner! That's the house that you helped with. I'm aware of that. I mean, it was a safety issue. You did the right thing. Excuse me. Hannah? Please say something. Can you believe we made all of this? Yeah, we did. You were right. A little bit of magic went a long way. Thanks, dad. Love you. Love you, too. Sarnowsky's vouched for you. You're not a killer. Are you going to do the same for her? Neither of us had anything to do with that, so... Well, prove it. Maybe the judge might be a little bit easier on you with all that other stuff you've got going on. What do you want to know? Were you there around the time Carmen Day was killed? I was. Did you kill Carmen Day? No. Do you know who did it? No. Why were the security cameras turned off the day that she died? Actually, why were they turned off earlier, when I was there? I don't know. You don't know? Hmm. You know, I was thinking, and I do that every now and then... Why does a guy with so many locker keys cause cameras to mysteriously turn off every time he walks into a building? No idea. Hmm. How long have you been fencing stolen goods out of the facility? I don't have a clue what you're talking about. Don't have a clue? Okay. You don't have to answer... But tell me this... Would you rather go to jail for theft, or for murder? You can take a second on that. We didn't even know about the body until it turned up. So you saw her that night? She walked past me. My back was turned. Maybe someone was following her, but Michelle was out front. What did you see? Nothing... But I heard an argument down the hall. Voices echoing. A scuffle, a scream, a locker door slamming. I went running. When I got around the corner, all I saw was a backdoor swinging and an empty hallway. I swear on my kid's life. Well, you'd better hope, for you and your kid's sake, that you're telling the truth... Because as of right now, you are the last person to see Carmen alive. Wow. This place hasn't changed since high school. It's the same stuff. Our table. We all had a lot of fun here. Yeah, exactly. Same old jukebox. Oh, that only played that one terrible song no matter what you picked. And that server with the hair net and the evil glare. Just kick us out every time we turned it on. Yeah, I'd be sick of that song, too, if I worked here. You know, I never heard her say a single word. She'd just point us to the door. Yeah. I wonder whatever happened to her? Coffee? Two, please. Wow. I don't think I realized how much I missed her until just now. What are you doing? Nothing. Oh... Come on, you know you want to. Is she looking? Yes. Is she pointing to the door? Not yet. Hey. Are you the one who's been asking about Aimee and me? No. I think you must be confused. I heard you were at the theater, asking about us. I mean, you really fit the description. I'm just here to get something out of my locker. Wait. No, you were at the memorial, right? Yeah, you were. I saw you. You might've. I work near there. So maybe you heard me have some words with Carmen's brother? I'm not sure. I mean, that's probably how this whole investigation got launched. Look, I really don't have time... You're the witness that saw me wearing the BAX hat, same as the video. My husband is waiting for me inside. You think I did it? I don't know, but I'm going to let the police do their job. You do, don't you? How? I mean, I was at the movies. There's no way. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't have. Look, this is none of my business. No, you're right, it isn't. So maybe you should just drop it. Fine. If you'll excuse me... Okay, fine. I didn't kill Carmen. You got to believe me. Look, I loved her. I still love her. I'm sure you do. Frank Lynwood. Frank! Frank, I'm at the storage facility. Grey Baxter was following me. I don't know if you got my message, but he doesn't have an alibi. Oof! Hey! Possible 10-35 in progress. I need all available units to the extra storage facility, now! We got a 10-35 at the extra storage facility on Grand Ave. You both should've left him alone. Aimee, this isn't going to make things better. It's not going to make it any worse. Why were you following me? I wasn't. You were. I know 'cause I was following you. Aimee... Just... Just... relax. I can help you. I can help you. I'd say the same thing if I was you right now... But it wouldn't make it true. Besides you, who knows? Look, detective Lynwood is on to you. He's on his way here. He knows everything I know. What exactly do you know? I know that Carmen had a big piece of Grey's heart, something I'm assuming that you wanted. You've known him since you were kids. You've probably waited for him ever since... And when you finally got him, he just couldn't let go of her. You can't leave her alone even now, huh? I loved her. You said you were at the movies with Grey, but he wasn't there. The manager recalls you being alone. You had two tickets when you walked into the police station, so I could assume that Grey stood you up, and that you knew why. We have several witnesses who say that you were harassing her constantly. She even changed schools, right? It was hard getting over her. You had probably seen his texts or his social media posts on Carmen's photos after the last several months, and you knew that he wasn't over her, but you thought you knew where he was, so you went looking for Grey, or maybe you just went to confront Carmen to tell her to leave him alone. You got in the unlocked door at the storage facility. Can you check to make sure the backdoor's latching properly, please? Uh, yeah, no problem. I have to grab something from the back anyway. See you tomorrow. Yep, bye. Please stop calling. Look, it's been over for a while now, okay? Please move on. You're a good guy, just... Not for me, okay? What you didn't know is that Carmen didn't want him back... ...and with the security cameras off, the manager probably didn't even know you were inside the building. And taking Zetto up on his offer to help herself to anything in his locker, Carmen went looking for the mask that he made her. She chose the wrong locker. You confronted her. What are you doing here? I want you to leave him alone. No, you tell him to leave me alone. If you want him, have him. He's yours. You shouldn't be back here. Do you love him? Go away. Do you love him? No... And between you and me, he's not worth either of our time. Just move on. He'll do the same to you. You don't know him. I know he won't leave me alone. Ask him yourself. - Don't say that! - Get out! Your anger got the better of you. You panicked. You knew you had to get out of there before anyone would see you. Aimee, it could've been an accident, but shooting me, that's a double-murder. No one's going to believe me anyway. I believe you. That is not enough. Aimee... The judge might see Carmen as a crime of passion, but this is premeditated. You will go to jail for the rest of your life. You will never see Grey again. I was just tired of always being someone's second choice. I know, but make the right choice right now. Put the gun down. Frank, she has a gun! It's Aimee! Right! Go with him. Drop the gun... Now. It's over. We're done here. Drop the gun... now. Well, Aimee is in custody and getting the help that she needs. What about the facility manager? Oh, Sarnowsky and Whitaker? Well, they were both charged with theft, among other things. And the ex-boyfriend? Oh, Grey Baxter? He was completely cleared. In fact, he's trying to set a scholarship up in Carmen's name. Wow... So all is well. All is well. Oh... Look at that smile. What? That smile has Drew written all over it. Oh... maybe. Maybe? What do you mean, maybe? I don't know. I always just assumed that my soulmate was out there somewhere, pushing on a pull door. You know, I was starting to get worried. Well, at least he finally got it right. He really did. Oh... When are you seeing him again? He should be here anytime, actually. How do I look? Beautiful... And happy... And I love seeing you happy. I'm always happy... But you could add "smitten" to the list. Ooh, smitten like a kitten! Oh! Mr. Zetto! How are you? What a beautiful shop. I could get lost in here for hours. Well, thank you. We do have some wonderful new pieces. Yeah, the ones not in evidence. Mm. It must've taken you years to gather a collection like this. Uh, yeah, it's... It's my life's work. I'm glad to see it's in good hands now, though. Look, I have to be honest... I'm not quite sure why you wanted me here. Well, we know you've fallen on hard times recently. Yeah, understatement of the year, yeah. So we wanted to help you out. What? How so? We would like to sell your pieces on consignment so you can get back on your feet. I don't know what to say. Say yes. Yes! I'd love to, yeah. Thank you! Hey. Hey. You ready? I'll just get my coat. Oh, Drew, this is Lawrence Zetto. Lawrence, this is Drew Grant. Hey. Whoa... Opera bill from Verdi's Falstaff? Is that real? Well, it is a reprint, but it's a first-run reprint. Well, it would look good in my living room. Would you like me to ring it up for you? Please. Thank you. We'll be in touch. We will. Is it okay if I leave it here so I don't have to carry it around? Oh, of course. You can pick it up any time. Where to? Anywhere. Everywhere. Bye. Bye. Oh... Young love. Do you hear that? Never a sound so sweet. Silence. Yes! So, do you still love me even though I didn't bring home the trophy? You doing the right thing makes me love you even more. I just feel bad for Hannah. The trophy meant a lot to her. Did someone say trophy, ladies and gentlemen? Oh... Sorry. Where'd you get that? After the dedication ceremony, the winners gave it to us. Yeah, they said the only reason they won was because of you. So, really, it's yours. She's a beauty. Yes, she is, but you organized everything. I think you deserve it. Whatever we're having, I'm starving. Logan! Oh... sorry. We should we go. Yeah, we don't want to ruin you guys' quiet time. No, no, no, sit. Are... you sure? Oh, silence is overrated anyway. And unattainable. Okay, you guys, pass out these placemats and napkins. Still got the pizza? Oh, yes. Not sure we're going to have enough food! Uh, mom? Yeah? Just came by to say thank you for all your work on the case. Oh, conveniently around dinner time? Well, you know, Sally, she's still visiting her mom, and... Have a seat, Frank. Are you sure? Oh, absolutely. Have a seat. Detective Lynwood. Here, you call me Frank. Well, Frank, I wanted to pick your brain. Mm-hmm? I was thinking of writing the detective's test. No problem. By the way, is there a... Hands up... Anybody here who doesn't want my job? How about I do some undercover work? Well, not me. I'm going to stick to what I do best. At the store? Yes.
