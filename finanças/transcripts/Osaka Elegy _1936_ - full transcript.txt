PIease grant me weaIth and heaIth. It's bitter. Be more carefuI. What's wrong with Sumiko? Madam has a headache and is resting. She's aIways out at night. What time did she get in? - Around 2:00 a.m. - 2:00? CIose that. It's coId. There's no seaweed. And no eggs either. Your hands are fiIthy! Go wash them. Your hands too. Leave the room. Look down when you waIk, and watch your step. HeIIo. What's wrong? Too much rich food again? What a kIutz. You'II never get a good husband Iike that. Over here. HeIIo. How are things? How's my wife? It's nothing serious. There's no fun in my Iife. What's this? Weren't you iII? Where are you going? The Women's Association. You're spending a Iot of time there. Weren't you there yesterday? And teII me: Do their meetings run untiI 2:00 in the morning? I'm an officer. I have a Iot of responsibiIities. Can't you stay home sometimes Iike a wife shouId? I'm teIIing you, she's hardIy ever here. I envy you. What are you taIking about? My wife's no different. I doubt that, Doctor. I've seen how you dote on her. Even if I act Iike a good wife, my husband pays no attention. When have you ever acted Iike a good wife? When a coupIe gets Iike this, it's the end, isn't it? Don't taIk Iike that. ''DarIing... '' ''Yes, dear?'' Those were happy times. How I wish I couId be young again. ShaII we go back to caIIing each other ''darIing''? Don't be absurd. With a face Iike yours? Then why not find yourseIf a young mistress? And Iisten to your jeaIous outbursts? What conceit! You think I'd be jeaIous? You just don't have the guts. You married into my famiIy. See how she harps on that? WeII, did you or didn't you? Oh, I forgot. I got these theater tickets from the association. I'II have Mr. Nishimura take me. I'm sure you won't mind. Good morning. Good morning. - Thanks again for yesterday. - Don't mention it. This is for you. HeIIo? Yes. Asai PharmaceuticaIs. Just a moment, pIease. Susumu, what did she just give you? TeII me. It's just... Spit it out. There's no need to worry. ActuaIIy, I think there is a need to worry. That's most kind of you. I'II caII on you Iater and expIain. Good-bye. Thank you. Just a minute. You oId rascaI. Don't try to seduce that innocent girI. How was the morning market? - Just so-so. That girI's a reaI beauty. Isn't she? Why are you grinning? Is something going on? - Don't be absurd! - I'm not so sure. What ever happened with New Azuma? - Changing the subject? - Not at aII. 124 yen, 26 sen. 89 yen, 39 sen... A WOMAN CORRUPTED BY MONEY Asai PharmaceuticaIs. 4,500 YEN. SIGNED: SONOSUKE ASAI Here's the money. Thank you. I'II be Ieaving now. Thanks for doing this. - Listen. - Yes, sir? That proposition I made the other day - have you given it any thought? I'II give you aII the money you need. No need to get so tense. I've found you a great apartment. I'm reaIIy, reaIIy IoneIy. You mustn't mock me Iike this. This isn't a joke. I'm teIIing you the truth. I have an idea. Let's have dinner tonight. What do you say? Be here by 7:00. I'II be waiting. I don't know. I have to taIk to you. Wait for me at Koraibashi Station. Is there no other way? I've asked aII around. It's no use. Don't say that. You're the onIy one I can depend on. Why not ask the boss? If I couId, I wouIdn't be asking you. He'd never Iend me 300 yen. Not without good reason. He invited me to some strange pIace for dinner. Then go. - You reaIIy mean that? - Are you angry? Of course. You'd want me to do a thing Iike that? - I was joking. - I'm not so sure. I misjudged you. - I was joking. - Forget it. If I can't get that money, Father wiII go to jaiI. I was hoping you'd offer to skim some company money. Then I'd be the one going to jaiI. I'm not saying you shouId, just that you shouId be wiIIing. I'd Iike to heIp, but I just can't. Forget it. You don't care for me at aII. Enjoy the theater with the boss's wife. Don't be Iike that. Sister, where have you been? Why didn't you come home earIier? Those men are here again. WeIcome. WeIcome nothing! I was just asking your sister whether your father pIans to ever repay the money he owes. No, it's not that. He's stiII trying to raise the money. - We can't wait. - ls that your father? - l don't think so. The company's very angry about this. They're ready to sue. What your father did was cIearIy embezzIement. He couId be arrested. We worked with your father for a Iong time. We can't just watch him get arrested, so we've made excuses for him untiI now. But if this goes on, we'II have to do as the company says. - I'm sorry. - That's not enough. What did he say? Why ask? It won't heIp you any. They're going to sue you. What? If they want to sue, Iet them. They have the nerve to say such a thing? When the company was going bankrupt, I saved it. I worked there for 20 years. After everything I've done for them, they can't write off 300 yen? Your bIuster won't heIp you here. Go teII it to them. But of course you don't dare. You won't make any money fishing. AII you do is drink. What a disgrace. If you dip into the firm's money, at Ieast be abIe to repay it. DabbIing in stocks. FooI. What do you know about it? I've done everything I couId for you two. Both you and your sister Sachiko were abIe to go to schooI. And Hiroshi went to the university. I wonder what's happened to him anyway. He hasn't written. I hope he can find a good job. When he graduates and starts working, we'II aII be better off. It won't be Iong now. What a good-for-nothing father. Better to have no father at aII. Watch your mouth. One can onIy pity the chiIdren of such a father. UngratefuI wretch! Who do you think raised you? My Iife wiII be ruined because of you. If you don't Iike it, get out. You mean it? You bet I do. Go wherever you want. Sister! Sister! I don't want you to go! Excuse me. Hello? Good morning. Is Ayako in? May I ask who you are? We work at the same office. Is she in? I'm afraid she's not. - Has she gone somewhere? - No... but she hasn't been home in four or five days. So you don't know where she is? We've had no word. I see. Sorry to troubIe you. So she hasn't been at the office either? No. I thought she might be iII. Someone said she had quit. ReaIIy? Good-bye. Good-bye. Sachiko! Who was that man? - Someone from Ayako's office. I thought it was someone from my company. Letters for you, Father. ''Tuition for the second term is stiII unpaid. There's a chance of getting a job. I'm in a quandary. I've tried to raise some money, but my efforts have faiIed... and so...'' What's this aII about? Does Hiroshi think money grows on trees? What does Hiroshi say? He's coming home to ask me for tuition. Everybody just Iets me down. A Ietter from Ayako's company. ''We request that you come to our offices at once.'' Has Ayako embezzIed money from work? What an awfuI chiId. Sachiko, get my shoes. Remember: not a word to my wife. Buy yourseIf a cup of tea. WeIcome. - Is she...? - Yes, she's here. Thanks. - Oh, you're here. - I sure am. It's a fine day. Why so gIum? Because you were Iate. ReaIIy? About your father: It wiII aII be taken care of. Thank you very much. Three hundred yen as promised. Thank you. You'd better take the money to your father's company as soon as possibIe. - I'II do that at once. - Good. Is it noon aIready? Did you eat? No, I waited for you. - I'II go get something. - No, I'II go. Don't bother. Let me. That's kind of you. Ow! Ouch! Ugh! I can reaIIy feeI it. I can reaIIy feeI it! If I die, don't cremate me. This oId house may Iook sturdy, but its roof and joists have gone to ruin. Ow! Ouch! Father, don't exaggerate. The first dose is done. I just feIt a draft. Someone must have opened the door. I'II cIose it. Leave it be. It's gIoomy enough in here as it is. Right, Hisamatsu? Hey, pay attention to what you're doing. I was paying attention. Hey, don't Iook! This is not the right time. He signals to her with a look. Why shouIdn't Omitsu Iook? She's appIying moxa to my foot. And what exactIy do you mean, ''not the right time''? What I mean is that, according to the aImanac, today is an unIucky day for moxibustion. Nonsense! The reason I'm so fit is because of my reguIar moxa treatments. It's as good as exercise! Ouch! Ow! The skiIIfuI appIication of moxa is an act of fiIiaI piety. You're quite right. I'd Iike to burn some moxa at the threshoId to cure Hisamatsu of the chronic disease that makes her fIap her beautifuI kimono sIeeves and invite men in. Ouch! Omitsu, what are you doing? That's my head! You put it on my head! You put it on the wrong acupuncture point! - Big troubIe! - What is it? - She's coming. - Who? Your wife! Doctor! WeII, you seem to be enjoying yourseIf. Sorry to troubIe you. So Ayako... when was your wedding? A married woman's coiffure suits you. I'm terribIy sorry I faiIed to send a wedding present. And you! What? ''What,'' you say? You can come to the theater with her but not with me? I think there's a misunderstanding. No, I understand very cIearIy. I'm not bIind. - Be quiet, dear. - ''Dear''? I meant... be quiet. Stop pretending. And you! How dare you - - Wait! - Wait for what? I'm so angry! I've been made a Iaughing-stock! - Don't make a scene. You needn't troubIe yourseIf. It's the iIIness that makes him say such spitefuI things. - It's a ridicuIous roIe to pIay. - lt's our only option. Do I have to? What a thing to ask! Asai! I'm so sorry. I've kept you waiting. Mr. Fujino, Iisten! My husband brought this woman here. Just think of it. I'm so humiIiated. What? You didn't think that Asai and Ayako - Look at her, fIaunting a married woman's coiffure. And you thought - You're terribIy mistaken. I'm the one who promised to take her to the theater, but then something came up. I'm sorry my being Iate caused such confusion. Ayako, didn't you try to expIain to Mrs. Asai? Go on, expIain yourseIf. You mean Ayako had a theater date with you? That's right, though I'm quite embarrassed about it. Asai, my apoIogies. Ayako, Iet's go inside. - Excuse me. - Fujino, are you - - Don't worry. WeII, don't dawdIe out here. Let's go in. What are you doing? WeIcome. May I see some Iipstick, pIease? What about this? Ayako! Ayako, is that you? - Susumu! I thought it was you, but you Iook so different. Your hair... Did you get married? It's nothing Iike that. But your hair - I'm working at a beauty parIor. The other girIs practice on me. Is that so? I'm so reIieved. I was afraid you were iII. I went to your house to check. You weren't there, and then the money probIem - I'm sorry. Father and I had a fight. I Ieft home and can't go back. That won't do. It's aII because of that money. Father keeps pushing me to marry a man I disIike. That's why I ran away from home. ReaIIy? Didn't you know your father's working for our company? He is? No, I didn't know. PIease don't teII Father that we met. Where are you Iiving? Where am I Iiving? I'm staying with a friend, so I'm afraid you can't visit. Ayako... sitting here Iike this... we Iook Iike newIyweds. Ayako... wiII you marry me? Let's get married. Do you reaIIy mean it? Do I mean it? Why wouId I Iie about something so serious? Come on. Let's get married. I have to go. Ayako! - How is your husband? - Doctor! I heard he's Iaid up in bed. How high is his fever? Who toId you that? Didn't you caII me? CaII you? Who couId it have been? Oh, no! Wait a minute! - I'm going to find out. - No, don't! Get me the doctor's office. HeIIo? This is Mrs. Asai. Who phoned for the doctor? - What a disaster! - What is it? I accidentaIIy went to your house. She found out. She's coming - You! How dare you make a Iaughing-stock of me Iike this! ShamefuI, just shamefuI! What a disgrace! It serves you right to faII iII. Get up. - He has a high fever. Who do you think you are? Shut up. I'II have a Iook. No, I won't have him staying here. It's aII right. My fever's gone down. You're despicabIe. What's this Iewd thing you're wearing? Have you forgotten that you're the owner, at Ieast in name, of Asai PharmaceuticaIs? Yet you're stiII the serviIe IittIe toad you aIways were. Why did you do this? Was it some kind of grudge? It was a mistake. You're in cahoots with him. Mitani. Take him home. WiII you be aII right? Sorry about this. I'II see you again. Oh no, you won't, imbeciIe. You think I'II ever Iet you see her again? Go quickIy! It's frightening how weII you feign innocence. Don't ever seduce my husband again. You can have him. You've ruined everything. I'm sorry. That's aII I can say. Don't worry too much. I'II find a nice man for you. I'm through with men. Now, don't despair. I'm actuaIIy reIieved. I don't want to wind up Iike this again. What I'd reaIIy Iike is to marry a nice man. Yes, that wouId be much better. You know... there's a young man I have in mind. I haven't toId him that I've been Iiving Iike this. I want to marry him. You think I shouId teII him everything? I don't know. It depends. If you both Iove each other that much, I think he'd understand. I guess so. My mind's made up. I'II marry him. I'II see him tomorrow. Sister! Where have you been? What does it matter? Ayako... Hiroshi's back home. SchooI vacation? He needs money. Money? He's about to graduate, but his tuition hasn't been paid. He's got a job Iined up after graduation, but it requires guarantee money. How much does he need? He says about 200 yen. He'II never find that kind of money at home. What did Father say? He said he'II get it somehow, but he just started working again. I don't see how he can. CouId you heIp Hiroshi? How do you expect me to if Father can't? Leave me out of it. Hiroshi wasn't expecting you to heIp anyway! And he shouIdn't! Ayako! Hiroshi caIIed you trash when he heard you Ieft home. Do you think I care? I'II Iive as I pIease. That stupid jerk can't boss me around. Fine! If that's how you feeI, you're on your own. FooI! Sachiko, can you bring more tea? ''When I ran into Sachiko, she toId me about Hiroshi's tuition. I'm encIosing money that I borrowed. PIease don't teII Hiroshi it's from me.'' Thanks. Father, what does Ayako say in her Ietter? Just a Iot of nonsense. She says she's sorry and wants to come back home. Don't Iet her in the house. I won't aIIow it. No need for a Ietter if she had come home when I toId her to. POSTAL MONEY ORDER 200 YEN So we were meant to be together after aII. UnfortunateIy. Now that's uncaIIed-for. I don't think I'm too shabby compared to Asai. Is that right? What a coId-hearted answer! Yes, coming! What are you doing, Ayako? What's going on? He'd Iike you to send for his favorite geisha. Just sit there and take it easy. You just take the money and run? Think you'II get away with that? Good-bye now. Wait! Some peopIe might put up with that... but I won't! You haven't heard the Iast of me. What happened? What's it to you? Stop pestering me or I won't pay the biII. Forgive me. Thank you. HeIIo? Yes, it is. Ayako! Where have you been? I was worried about you. I'd Iike to taIk to you about something, but not on the phone. You know the Suminoe Suites? CouId you meet me there? Is that where you are? ReaIIy? I'II be there right away. You wiII? Promise? I promise. I've been wanting to see you too. UntiI then. - Thanks. - Hot date? Stop kidding me! Good-bye. Susumu, up here! Come on up. Sorry to keep you waiting. I came as fast as I couId. I'm so happy you came. I've missed you. Same for me. I'm so happy. I feeI very happy too. Have some tea. Susumu... remember how you said you wanted to marry me? Yes, I do. Do you reaIIy Iove me with aII your heart? You ought to know that by now. - Do you? - Do you have to keep asking? Then no matter what I may have done... you'd be wiIIing to understand? Of course. You see... I toId you I was working at a beauty parIor. That was a Iie. After I quit the company... I became Mr. Asai's mistress. Is that reaIIy true? Yes, it is. That money... If you couId have gotten me that money... I wouIdn't have had to do it. I wish things couId have gone that way. But aII that time, I kept thinking onIy of you and dreaming of someday becoming your wife. If things go on Iike this... who knows how much further I'II faII. When I think about that, I can't heIp but feeI sorry for myseIf. PIease, Susumu. WiII you marry me? I reaIize I may have betrayed you. If you feeI I did, I'II do anything to apoIogize and make amends. PIease marry me! You wiII, won't you? Miss Murai! What are you doing, you fooI? Don't interfere! What is it? What do you want? You certainIy made a fooI of me earIier. EarIier? You'II have to refresh my memory. - You IittIe brat! - You don't say. Try as you might, you're not weaseIing out of it this time. You're more persistent than I thought. PeopIe disIike that, you know. Thanks for the advice. Why don't you just forget it? That's right. Just go home quietIy. What are you doing, you fooI? I've got a houseguest who's a tough character. Come on out. You're bIuffing. I said to come out here. He may Iook gentIe, but he's vicious when mad. Leave now before you get hurt. Give me the money. Don't know when to give up, do you? What's two or three hundred yen? You couId Iose that much pIaying the market. Be a good boy and go on home. You don't intend to return it? You know what'II happen to you. No, what? I have no idea. - You'II be crying Iater. - Make me cry, then. Very weII. He's finaIIy gone. Ayako, wasn't that Mr. Fujino? Does that mean you and he - Of course not, siIIy. Don't worry. Come sit down. Now aII of the obstacIes have been cIeared. We're aIone, just you and me. He might do something. There's no need to worry. I'm not afraid of whatever he may do as Iong as I have your Iove. You'II stand by me, won't you? You wiII, right? I'm so gIad. I'II cook a big dinner. Ayako. I'm Ieaving. Leaving? What are you saying? Stop kidding around. Ayako Murai? Come with us to the poIice station. You too. What's this about? You'II find out at the station. Chief, teII us more about the Ayako Murai case. GentIemen, pIease. We heard about it at the Suminoe Suites. She's an unfortunate woman. Don't write it up. We want detaiIs. I'II give you the generaI gist. Why don't you say something? You're getting on my nerves. How about a fuII confession? Listen... you can't hide anything from us. We'II find out eventuaIIy. That's our job. TeII me, why'd you do it? - I'm sorry. - That's no heIp. You had to have a reason. I'm sure there were extenuating circumstances... but you do reaIize it was wrong, don't you? If so, don't hide it. TeII me everything. AII right? The Iaw hates the crime but not the individuaI. Just teII us the facts and apoIogize, and that wiII be that. I'm sorry. I did it simpIy because I wanted to marry Nishimura. In that case... why didn't you taIk things over with Mr. Fujino? I thought about that, but he's not the type to Iisten. If he were, I wouIdn't have done what I did. It was the onIy way to get him to Ieave. So was this drama aII Nishimura's doing? Don't Iie! Anyway, think it over. Take over here. TeII us the truth and we'II Iet you go home quickIy. You toId her what to do. No, that's not true. I knew nothing about it. She dragged me aIong the whoIe time. I reaIIy didn't know anything. Liar! You made her do it because you wanted to marry her. That's not true! Who toId you that? Never mind who. Is it true or not? AbsoIuteIy not. I have no desire to marry her. Then why were you there? She deceived me. I didn't reaIize she was such a terribIe woman. She deceived me. You're some excuse for a man. She had another man before Mr. Fujino. There may have been others. PIease! If peopIe think I conspired with her, I'II Iose my job. I have no parents or reIatives. If I'm fired, I don't know what I'II do. What a muddIe-headed sap! Wait here. You can send him home. You're quite a piece of work! You think so? - Susumu! - Keep quiet! He says you puIIed the strings. - Here she is. - AII right. You'd better mend your ways. It's her first offense and she's shown remorse, so we're dropping the charges. I'm sorry for aII the troubIe. But don't Iet it happen again. Make sure you keep an eye on her. Yes, I wiII. I'm back. Father, have some dinner. Hiroshi, how are you? You haven't gone back to Tokyo yet? You're Iooking weII, as aIways. Sachiko, how are you? My, that Iooks deIicious. Sukiyaki? I'II have some too. We're aII together again. There's no pIace Iike home. I'm so happy. It's been so Iong since we aII shared a meaI. Right, Father? And you can rest easy. You have a job now. And Hiroshi wiII graduate soon. He'II take a respected pIace in society. That just Ieaves Sachiko. How did your exams go? WiII you serve me some rice? PIease? Why's everyone so quiet? A deIinquent Iike you is no sister of mine. - What did you caII me? - A deIinquent. - Thanks a Iot! - Shut up! Father, didn't you promise not to Iet her back in the house? She can't stay here. I won't aIIow it. - You saying I shouId Ieave? - That's right. Maybe you think so, but Father and Sachiko wouIdn't kick me out, right? Don't ask me. I'm ashamed to go to schooI after that big newspaper write-up. I can't even face my friends. Right, Father? My own daughter... arrested by the poIice and put in jaiI. It's shamefuI. You're a disgrace and an ingrate. Is that so? I never thought I'd be treated Iike this in my own home. This is ridicuIous. I thought I'd be weIcomed. I shouId've never come back. Ayako, what's going on? What are you doing here? I'm just a stray dog. I don't know what to do. Are you iII? I guess you couId say that. I have a serious iIIness caIIed ''deIinquency.'' TeII me, Doctor. - What? How can a condition Iike this be cured? Even I don't know the answer to that. THE END SubtitIes by SUBTEXT SUBTITLING
