WE STARTED OUT HERE ON I-70, COMING ACROSS HERE, WE WENT UP 104, TOOK THE 49, THEN WE TOOK SHORTCUTS. WE GO 10, 12, 48, HUT. WE HAVE TO HIT CANTON HARD. I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE. UH, GUYS?

THEN HE PIVOTS, FAKES, CHUCKS THE BIG BOMB HALFWAY DOWN THE FIELD TO OUR, HOPEFULLY, STILL WIDE-OPEN TAILBACK. I CALL IT THE ANNEXATION OF PUERTO RICO. NOT BAD. REALLY? I KIND OF STOLE IT FROM YOU-- RAIDERS/VIKINGS-- SUPER BOWL 11. HEY, YOU ARE A GENIUS. THANKS. PROBLEM IS... WE DON'T HAVE A TAILBACK. HMM. LISTEN, WHAT IF YOU TRIED THIS? KNOW WHAT THIS IS CALLED?

IT'S JUST DOING WHAT THESE GUYS DO EVERY GAME. JUST GO OUT AND GIVE IT YOUR BEST. I TOOK A TEAM TO A SUPER BOWL, AND WE WON. I EVEN HAD SOME GUYS ON THAT TEAM NOBODY WANTED, BUT WE WERE A TEAM, THAT'S WHAT YOU GUYS ARE. YOU'RE A FOOTBALL TEAM. THAT'S LIKE A FAMILY, EXCEPT YOU GET TO HIT EACH OTHER, BUT YOU HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER. DO THAT, AND YOU'LL BE FINE. THANKS, MR. MADDEN. THANKS, MR. MADDEN! SEE YA! LET ME TELL YOU PEOPLE SOMETHING. THIS AIN'T JUST A FOOTBALL. THIS IS YOUR HOPES, YOUR DREAMS, YOUR AMBITIONS. YOUR SOUL ON A ROLL. IT'S YOUR LIFE. TOMORROW ON THAT FIELD, IT'S DO OR DIE... WIN OR CRY! GO, BABY! GO! MEN, TONIGHT WHEN YOU GO HOME, I WANT YOU TO BRUSH YOUR LITTLE TEETH. I WANT YOU TO WASH YOUR LITTLE FACES AND DREAM THE SWEET DREAMS OF FOOTBALL GLORY. 'CAUSE TOMORROW, WE'RE CRUSHING THE LITTLE GIANTS INTO SMITHEREENS. WHAT DO YOU SAY, MEN? YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! GUESS WHO? WHO? ME. HEY, JUNIOR. HEY. EW, THAT'S DISGUSTING. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO SWALLOW EACH OTHER'S HEADS. THEY'RE DOING IT WRONG. YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR HEAD DRAMATICALLY, LIKE KEVIN COSTNER DID IN ROBIN HOOD, LIKE THIS. NO. IN MOVIES, THEY DO THAT CHICKEN-PECKING, MOUTH HALF-OPEN THING, LIKE THIS, "HEY, BABY." NO. UH-UH. CHECK THIS OUT. MY COUSIN TOLD ME THAT HER AND HER BOYFRIEND USE THEIR TONGUES. EW, THAT'S DISGUSTING. I KNOW. SPIT SWAPPERS. YEAH. KIND OF LIKE THEM. TONSIL HOCKEY. HA HA HA. YOU KNOW, THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH KISSING YOUR OWN HAND IS... WHAT? IT DOESN'T KISS BACK. YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO KISS? NO. WHY, DO YOU? NO. OOH, I JUST GOT THAT VOMIT TASTE IN MY MOUTH. WE'LL HAVE TO LEARN HOW EVENTUALLY IF YOU WANT KIDS AND A JOB. YOU CAN HAVE KIDS WITHOUT KISSING. BUT YOU CAN'T GET A JOB. WELL, I'LL BECOME A TEACHER. BUT WHAT IF YOU WERE FORCED TO? WOULDN'T IT BE GOOD TO LEARN WITH A FRIEND? YOU KNOW, FOR SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES. UHH. NO WAY. LOOK, IF I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO KISS, AND I MEAN ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY NO WAY OUT OF IT NO MATTER WHAT, I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO KISS... WELL, THEN I THINK I'D WANT TO LEARN WITH... LET ME GUESS. DEBBIE. I DON'T KNOW. BUT IF NOT HER, DEFINITELY ANOTHER CHEERLEADER MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS REALLY WEIRD. HEY, JUNIOR... IF I WAS MORE LIKE THOSE CHEERLEADERS, YOU'D WANT TO LEARN WITH ME. BUT YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE DIFFERENT. YOU'RE COOL. YOU'RE THE ICEBOX. YOU'RE PROBABLY THE ONLY GIRL I'VE MET THAT CAN BEAT UP MY DAD. HEH. ANYWAYS, I'LL SEE YOU LATER. HEY. HEY, UNCLE KEV. IS, UH...

YOUR LITTLE F THAT'S ALL I AM TO YOU, ISN'T IT? YOUR LITTLE FULLBACK, YOUR TICKET TO BEATING KEVIN AND WINNING THE BIG GAME. BECKY, WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT'S WRONG? EVERYTHING'S WRONG. DO YOU KNOW WHAT MOM USED TO CALL ME? HER LITTLE PRINCESS. WHEN SHE TUCKED ME IN, SHE'D GO, "GOOD NIGHT, LITTLE PRINCESS." THEN SHE'D KISS ME ON MY CHEEKS, THEN PULL THE COVERS ALL AROUND ME. AND YOU REMEMBER THAT? YEAH. SHE WOULDN'T LET ME PLAY FOOTBALL. SHE WOULDN'T CALL ME HER LITTLE FULLBACK, EITHER. BECKY, LOOK... MOM'S NOT HERE ANYMORE. SHE LEFT US. SHE QUIT. NO. SHE DIDN'T QUIT.

WHEN I WAS 10 YEARS OLD, I PUT MYSELF ON THE INJURED LIST. I NEVER GOT OFF. WHY? 'CAUSE I DIDN'T GET PICKED A FEW TIMES, SO I STARTED HIDING UNDER THE BLEACHERS. THAT'S WHERE WE BELONG, UNDER THE BLEACHERS. NO, YOU DON'T. YOU GUYS BELONG OUT THERE WITH THOSE COWBOYS. YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW? BECAUSE I BELONG OUT THERE WITH MY BROTHER. COACH, YOU COULD NEVER BEAT KEVIN O'SHEA AT ANYTHING. NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE. I DID BEAT HIM ONCE. WHEN? WHEN WE WERE KIDS. WE USED TO RACE OUR BIKES DOWN CHERRY HILL AFTER SCHOOL. WE RACED EVERY DAY, AND HE ALWAYS WON, BUT ONE TIME, I BEAT HIM. YOU BEAT KEVIN DOWN CHERRY HILL? YES, I DID. HE ATE MY DUST. BIG DEAL. ONE TIME. YOU KNOW, ONE TIME AT RANDY COOPER'S SWIM PARTY, I DID A BACK FLIP OFF THE HIGH DIVE, AND MY BROTHER CHICKENED OUT. ROGER CHICKENED OUT? HE'S A MARINE. OH, THAT'S NOTHING. ONE TIME, IN SPRING CARNIVAL, I BEAT BOTH MY BROTHERS IN THE COW DUNG TOSS. YOU BEAT MATT AND BRAD IN THE TURD TOSS? ONE TIME I WENT FISHING WITH MY ENTIRE FAMILY, AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT DIDN'T THROW UP. THAT DOESN'T MAKE US GOOD FOOTBALL PLAYERS. WHO SAID YOU HAD TO BE GOOD TO PLAY FOOTBALL? YOU PLAY FOOTBALL 'CAUSE YOU WANT TO, AND 'CAUSE IT'S FUN. YOU PLAY FOOTBALL SO YOU CAN PRETEND YOU'RE JOE MONTANA THROWING A TOUCHDOWN PASS OR EMMITT SMITH GOING FOR A LONG RUN. EVEN IF THOSE COWBOYS ARE BETTER THAN YOU GUYS, EVEN IF THEY BEAT YOU 99 TIMES OUT OF 100, THAT STILL LEAVES-- ONE TIME. ONE TIME. YEAH. ONE TIME. YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! WHOO! WHOO! WHOO! STOP! WHO ARE WE? THE GIANTS! I JUST TOLD THE MAYOR YOU FORFEITED. WELL, YOU BETTER TELL THE MAYOR NOT TO BET ON THE COWBOYS IN THE SECOND HALF. YOU FORGET THAT'S MY FIELD. YEAH, WELL, WE GOT THE BALL.
