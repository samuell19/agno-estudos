(birds chirping) (footsteps thumping) (birds chirping) (Raul speaks in Spanish) (leader speaks in Spanish) (birds chirping) (footsteps thumping) (child speaks in Spanish) - Ramon.

How you been? - How's Grace and the kids? - All wonderful, there's another one on the way. - You never stop, do you? - I hope not. (Jack laughing) (traffic droning) (door slamming) (footsteps thumping) (child speaks in Spanish) (Jack speaks in Spanish) - Luis, I speak English. - Oh, good, get me in a cab, would ya? (traffic droning) (Luis whistling) (vehicle droning) (Jack speaks in Spanish) (Luis speaks in Spanish) (wheels squeaking) (door rattling) (traffic droning) (door slamming) - Hey, Luis, stay out of the sun. (door slamming) (vehicle droning) (upbeat music) (goat bleating) (upbeat music continues) (vehicle thumping) (upbeat music continues) (vehicle droning) (upbeat music continues) (door slamming) (upbeat music continues) (traffic droning) (door slamming) (vehicle honking) - Jack, (speaks in Spanish). (Jack speaks in Spanish) (guests laughing) (upbeat music) (singers sing in Spanish) (glasses clinking) (Maria speaks in Spanish) (singers sing in Spanish) (guests chattering) - General, Jack Cox (speaks in Spanish). (singers sing in Spanish) (guests chattering) (Anastasio speaks in Spanish) (singers sing in Spanish) (guests chattering) - Jack, it's good to see you again, my friend. - Good to see you too, General, how are you? - Well, very well. I was afraid you were going to miss the party. - What are we celebrating, by the way? - What difference does it make? One excuse is as good as another. Here, I want you to most beautiful woman in all of Nicaragua. Maria, this is Jack Cox, a good friend and an expert on Latin American affairs. Jack, this is Senorita Maria Cardena. - Pleased to meet you. - It's my pleasure. (upbeat music) (audience applauding) - Excuse us, please. (audience applauding) (audience chattering) (upbeat music) - Well, you don't look any the worse for where. Farlo, be sure everything is taken care of for my compadre here. (upbeat music continues) - Seems like I'm always taken care of so well here. - Of course you are, but I like to be sure, you know me, I like to worry about the details. (upbeat music continues) (singers sing in Spanish) - Though I could use a couple hours with you. How's you schedule? - I don't know, Jack, it's getting very hectic. We're having fresh problems with the rebels in Rio Blanco. I should get back right now. (upbeat music continues) (singers sing in Spanish) - Two hours, I won't waste your time. (upbeat music continues) (singers sing in Spanish) - 6:00 a.m. - In your office? - You'll be down in front, I will pick you up. - You're on. (singers sing in Spanish) - She's beautiful, huh? And every young man in Nicaragua wants to marry her. (singers sing in Spanish) - I think this young man out to go keep her from getting her feet tromped on. (Anastasio laughing) (singers sing in Spanish) - Is this your way of learning local customs? - I am very familiar with the local customs. I just came up here to keep you from getting a broken toe. (upbeat music continues) (singers sing in Spanish) (birds chirping) (vehicle droning) (gate squeaking) (vehicle droning) (placid music) (rebel whistling) (placid music continues) (vehicle droning) (tense music) (guns firing) (bazooka booming) (vehicle exploding) (fire roaring) (vehicle droning) (birds chirping) - What about the Sandinistas? - Ugh, a lot of trouble, more trouble every day. - How many? - 10, maybe 20,000. - So why can't you just put 'em outta business? - Ha, I could if I wanted to be remembered as a butcher. - (laughs) They call you that anyhow. - They call me a lot of things. (vehicle droning) You know, I had every one of those bastards in jail one time or another. I could have pinched the head off the snake right then. - So why didn't you? - I followed the democratic process, they had their trials, they were convicted, but there's nothing in the law to cover blackmail and murder. They forced they released, and now they're out there somewhere leading a revolution. - How about supplies? - Off the land, guns and ammunition from Castro. - What about recruits? - Some they take at the point of a gun, join or die. (children chattering) (Jack panting) (vehicle droning) (laughs) Five miles, you're in good shape. (vehicle exploding) Sergeant. (vehicle droning) Others join because they think any change will be better. Idiots, they think that they can control this monster that's about to swallow Central America. - Well, free electors might help. At least the world will know then you're trying. - Trying, oh my God, Jack, I'm willing to quit, to resign and leave the country, put it all up to the voters if only the Sandinistas were willing to abide by the results. Anything to stop the killing. - You mean supervised elections, organization of American states or the UN? - Absolutely, as a Nicaraguan, a West Point man and a friend, I give you my word that is exactly what I mean. Come on now, let's go, I'll drop you at the hotel. (vehicle droning) (suspenseful music) (siren ringing) (suspenseful music continues) - Tell the capitan to keep in touch, to call next time before the fish go bad. (vehicle droning) (footsteps thumping) - [Luis] Senor Jack. - Hello, Luis. How come you're not at the airport? That Miami flight's coming in. - I'm going, but I have another job too, working for my brother. When you need a taxi, my brother, Ramon, is the best driver man ever. - (speaks in Spanish) Well, if he's the best driver, must have been you who put those dents in that car. - Oh no, Senor Jack, the dents came with the car. - I'm getting them all pounded out. A few months and that'll be a first class taxi. - We're going to repaint it too, as soon as we get the money. - Business must be good, huh? (Ramon speaks in Spanish) I'll tell you what, make you a deal. Here's 50 bucks, now you get all the dents pounded out and get it painted, then you be there when I call. - You can depend on us. (traffic droning) - Senor Jack, we'll be there for sure. (traffic droning) (footsteps thumping) - Sophia, will you drop off the export invoices at the presidente's office on your way to lunch? (traffic droning) Well, hello, you're a hard man to find. - Well, I've been busy talking with cabinet ministers and various citizens of Nicaragua. - And you assumed I was just another society girl with nothing better to do than make phone calls? - Well, I sure didn't know you were a business woman. - Not all Latin women sit at home, waiting for a suitable husband, things are changing. - I kinda like it like that. - You do, in spite of your friend Somoza's opinion? - Somoza's opinion aside, I think he's done an awful lot to move this country along. - Somoza's a ruthless son of a bitch, intent only on filling his own pockets. - I thought you worked for him. - Somoza's a friend of my father's. My father's a typical land owner and businessman. He'd be friendly with anyone in power to get what he wants. - Including a job for you? - Which I happen to perform with considerable efficiency. - So what do you want out of it? - How about a free lunch? I hate to argue on an empty stomach. - You're on. (traffic droning) (romantic music) (footsteps thumping) (water rushing) (romantic music continues) Are you engaged to that fella I met at the party? - [Maria] Why? - [Jack] Just curious. - [Maria] Do you have ties back in the States? - [Jack] Why? - [Maria] Just curious. (Jack laughing) (romantic music continues) (vehicle droning) - You know, I've sure seen a lot more soldiers this time than the last time I was here. - El presidente is getting nervous with good reason. Where's your home? - Well, I used to live in Abilene, but doesn't seem like I get there much anymore. I've kinda been living out a suitcase. (traffic droning) - What's wrong? - That guy over there is watching us, I've seen him before. (traffic droning) - Somoza's secret police, they're everywhere. - So are the Sandinistas. - That's just the reality of Managua now. There aren't many places to escape anymore. - I might know one, do you wanna try and lose him? (customers chattering) (traffic droning) (Jack speaks in Spanish) (vehicle droning) (upbeat music) (singers sing in Spanish) Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (laughs). (dancers clapping) (dancers chattering) (romantic music) - Looks like you're having a good time. - Very. - I didn't know you knew our people so well. - I've been here a lot. I have good friends here. - You know, I'd like you to parents. We have a beautiful ranch up in the hills where I grew up. - I was scheduled to leave tomorrow. - The same plane goes out the next day. I'm going up there in the morning. I could write down the direction if you change your mind (giggles). (romantic music continues) - You wanna dance? (romantic music continues) (dancers chattering) (vehicle droning) (vehicle thumping) Did you get your driver's license? - [Ramon] Sure, in the mail. - You sure it's the way? - Don't worry, I'll get you there. (vehicle thumping) (vehicle droning) They say that's where the (speaks in Spanish) hide out. - I guess that's as good a place as any. (vehicle droning) (vehicle thumping) (dogs barking) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (vehicle droning) Nice house. - It's isolated. It was lonely growing up here. I always played with the children of the campesinos. I read a lot, mostly my father's books. (gentle music continues) (glass thumping) - I don't mean to pry, but I did kinda think I was gonna meet your folks. - I'm sorry, they wanted to meet you too. Papa had to find a new manager for one of his ranches along the coast. Mama went along for the rest. (gentle music continues) (birds chirping) (gentle music continues) (ball thumping) (gentle music continues) (birds chirping) (Jack speaks in Spanish) - You want coffee? - I'm fine, thank you. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) (gentle music continues) (thunder rumbling) (rain splattering) - You know, I gotta get home. - How do you propose you get there? It's a 15 mile walk back to the nearest bus stop. It's raining, they don't even run at night. There's only one car. It's mine, I won't lend it to you. So you'll just have to stay the night. (romantic music) Check. (romantic music continues) (birds chirping) (romantic music continues) (thunder rumbling) It's beautiful in the morning here when it rains, huh? - Sure is, sure rains a lot too. (rain splattering) - Why don't you stay here with me? (birds chirping) (thunder rumbling) - I want to, but I've got a job to do and I'm not doing it very well. (birds chirping) (rain splattering) Listen, the whole world really needs to know what's going on here. - [Maria] Mm-hmm. - I've got Somoza's story. I need the Sandinista side. (footsteps thumping) (vehicle droning) You wouldn't happen to know of those people, would ya? - [Maria] Who? - The Sandinista, I thought if you had any connections, that you could introduce me. - No, they wouldn't wanna talk to you or anyone from the States. - Why not? There's two sides to every conflict, I'd like to hear theirs. I'd also like to see how they react to some of the things that Somoza told me. - It's too dangerous. (vehicle droning) - Then you do know 'em? - All right, Jack, I went to school with some of the people who lead this revolution. I grew up with them. - So why wouldn't they talk to me? - It's not you as a writer or an individual. It's the whole history of exploitation in Central America by people like Somoza. They've learned not to trust Americans. - Why don't you let them tell me that? - Look, I just said I went to school with them. I grew up with 'em. - Maria, put me in touch with them. Let them have their say. - You know, you're a persistent, arrogant, foolish man. (vehicle droning) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (water splashing) (gentle music continues) (horse snorting) (hooves clomping) (gentle music continues) (cicadas chirping) (gentle music continues) (suspenseful music) (rebel speaks in Spanish) (cicadas chirping) (suspenseful music continues) - What are those masks for? - To hide their identity from the secret police and protect their families. (hooves clomping) (suspenseful music continues) (birds chirping) (fire crackling) (suspenseful music continues) (thunder rumbling) (suspenseful music continues) (birds chirping) (suspenseful music continues) (footsteps thumping) - (speaks in Spanish), Jack Cox. - Senors. (suspenseful music continues) (lightning striking) (suspenseful music continues) I'm an American journalist. I spent several hours talking with General Somoza and several members of his cabinet and various citizens of Nicaragua. I persuaded Maria to bring me up here because I thought it only fair to get your side of the story too. So if you care to answer some questions or make a statement. - Get out of here and go print Somoza's lies before I have you shot. (thunder rumbling) - You clearly can do that, but it doesn't say anything about the revolution. - There is nothing to say about it to anyone other than the people of Nicaragua. It is their revolution. (gun rattling) - Is this the people's revolution? It says here that this was made in Czechoslovakia. - And this was sent here by the United States. I personally removed it from the body of one of Somoza's secret police. And guns like these have been used for more than 70 years to loot my country of its natural resources. (lightning striking) With that one, we're stopping it forever. - Somoza said he was ready to put the whole thing up to a vote with the people. (leader laughing) Are you willing to do the same? - No, no, there is only one kind of revolution that will permanently cure the cancer of Somoza, and that is the revolution of the gun. - The people's revolution of the gun. - Yes, any other way will be an invitation to disaster. Allende's revolution in Chile was peaceful. The fascists took up arms as soon as they could and slaughtered him. - Allende went into office with only 38% support of the people. Before long, the communists were running the country. - And running it peacefully. (thunder rumbling) (rain splattering) This is all the fascists understand, and it is all they will get. Now get out while you can. - Whatever you wish. - And one more thing, Yankee. When you go, don't ever come back. Stay out of Nicaraguan or we'll have your head. You know something? I'd like to kill this son of a bitch right now. (thunder rumbling) (rain splattering) - He came here under my protection. He leaves here under my protection, is that clear? (thunder rumbling) (rain splattering) - If y'all ever get to Abilene, look me up. I'll show you some real Texas hospitality. - Go to hell, will you? (vehicle droning) (birds chirping) - Jack, I wanted to say goodbye under better circumstances. (traffic droning) (birds chirping) - Maria, why don't you come with me? I mean, I don't think you're all that fond to Somoza, and I really don't think you care that much about the guy with the beard in the hills. This country's in trouble, come with me. - It's still my country. - I sure hope it stays that way. (gentle music) - Goodbye, Jack. I don't think you should come back to Nicaragua. (gentle music continues) (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) (vehicles droning) (hostages crying) (leader speaks in Spanish) (hostages crying) (hostages chattering) (vehicles droning) (hostages crying) (hostages chattering) (soldier yelling) (glass shattering) (vehicle exploding) (leader yells in Spanish) (guns firing) (soldier yells in Spanish) (guns firing) (rebels screaming) (guns firing) (leader yells in Spanish) (bazooka booming) (door exploding) (leader yells in Spanish) (soldier yells in Spanish) (guns firing) (lever boinging) (building exploding) (fire roaring) - [Anchor] It's beginning to look like the long-rumored all-out-battle for Managua is underway. This has been the heaviest day of fighting yet, as General Anastasio Somoza's national guard troops began moving into the strongholds of the Sandinista rebels, the barrios, while the people were fleeing the barricaded slum bastions of the Sandinistas. Last night, General Somoza designated some of the barrios free fire zones, subject to bombing and shelling at any time. Meanwhile, in Washington, President Carter stated his thoughts. (employees chattering) (typewriter rattling) (phones ringing) (employees chattering) - Anything exciting? - Yeah. Some vandals turned loose 200 penguins on the South Lawn over the White House. (Elizabeth laughing) - Jack, I got some good news and some bad news. - [Jack] How about the good news? - It's a go. - All right. - Oh, that's great. - We want documentary reports on conditions in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Jack, the reason we're having you go down there is El Salvador and Nicaragua are in a hell of a mess. But hey, with your expertise, you should be able to get in and outta there with no problems. - Fine by me. - Me too, all I need is a sound man and someone to carry the gear. - Can't have 'em. If you can't carry it, don't take it. - Okay, I can cope. You interview and narrate and I'll shoot everything. - So what's the bad news, Harry? We got a borrow on plane tickets? - The correspondent for the Harte Hanks newspapers, Jim Conley, is going along and will sit in on all the interviews. - What? - What the hell for? - He's going as a watchdog to guarantee the objectivity of the interviews. - 15 years as a Latin American specialist, and I gotta have a watchdog? - You don't, we do. The easiest way to discredit a documentary is to cry bias. We're just gonna have 'em off at the pass. - I'll live with it, let's go. (employees chattering) (phone ringing) (aircraft droning) (passengers chattering) - [Flight Attendant] Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has asked-- - I prefer the aisle. - [Flight Attendant] That all carry-on luggage be stowed in the overhead racks or under your seats, thank you. (flight attendant speaks in Spanish) - Go ahead. (passengers chattering) (flight attendant speaks in Spanish) (aircraft roaring) Can we get any footage of the rebels? - (laughs) That's doubtful. I'd like to, but I don't imagine they'll cooperate. - Now that gives you half a report, Somoza's half. - What the hell are you suggesting by that? - I'm just listening. - With a bent ear. - Listen, if you two are gonna fight, I don't wanna be the referee. Now we get whatever we can get without getting shot, okay? - Okay by me, how do you work these interviews? - I always start with a series of questions, springboard for comments by Somoza and the others. And they can state whatever they wish, might lead us into something we don't know about. And you can ask whatever you choose. - But you have the basic questions to keep them on your track. (aircraft droning) - We're here to do a report on local conditions, an objective report. - You're stretching the definition of the word without equal time for the other side. - How the hell do you suppose we're gonna do that? I mean, we'll state their position as fairly as possible, but you know, it's very hard to do an interview with a man that's shooting at you. - When you cover a war, you go to the battle zone. - How many wars have you covered, Mr. Conley? - Just one, Vietnam, and various prison riots, natural and unnatural disasters, gang wars, shootouts, you? - Why don't we let him cover the rebels and we'll go along as the watch dogs? (passengers chattering) (aircraft roaring) (announcer speaks in Spanish) - Hey, Carlos. - What the hell are you doing here? - We're making a documentary film. - I hope you live long enough to do it. Everybody else is leaving in the country. - Now, you're gonna scare my film crew out. - I don't care, let these people ride back on that plane, okay? (announcer speaks in Spanish) - Welcome to Nicaragua. (announcer speaks in Spanish) (traffic droning) - [Luis] Jack, Senor Jack (speaks in Spanish). Senor Jack, it's me, Luis. (Jack speaks in Spanish) - Look, isn't Ramon's taxi beautiful? He'll give you a special service while you're here. - Oh, it's good to see you again, my friend. (traffic droning) - Buenos, Senor Jack. - [Elizabeth] Hi, I'm Elizabeth Rush. - Hi. (traffic droning) (vehicles honking) (tense music) (vehicle droning) (pedestrians chattering) - [Jim] Look at that. - [Elizabeth] Oh my God. (vehicle droning) (traffic droning) (fire crackling) (siren ringing) (vehicle droning) (fire crackling) (soldier yells in Spanish) - [Jack] Jesus, what a mess. - [Ramon] It's like this all over. There is a curfew, but the Sandinistas still attack at night. (vehicle droning) (dog barking) - It looks like a war zone. - It is a war zone. (vehicle droning) Where are the Sandinistas now, Ramon? - They are everywhere. They were near the airport three days ago. (pedestrians chattering) (vehicle droning) - Looks like we really stepped in it. (vehicle droning) (pedestrians chattering) - This'll make good footage, pull over here, Ramon. (vehicle droning) (soldiers chattering) - [Elizabeth] Hand me the camera. (vehicles droning) Okay, go. (vehicle droning) (soldiers chattering) (siren ringing) (vehicle droning) (pedestrians chattering) (soldiers speaks in Spanish) - Get your press cards out, we're being stopped. (siren ringing) (feet thumping) (soldier speaks in Spanish) (traffic droning) (Jack speaks in Spanish) (soldier speaks in Spanish) (civilians chattering) (dog barking) (soldier speaks in Spanish) (fire crackling) (dog barking) (doors slamming) (vehicle droning) (soldier speaks in Spanish) (guests chattering) - [Jim] Did you make a note about guardsman? You might wanna get it on film. - Yeah, there's a bunch of 'em, not very exciting. - They'll be in the background of anything we do. - They don't have any ammo clips in their weapons. Some of 'em have rags stuff in the chamber. Now that may be to keep the dust down, but my guess is they couldn't stop an attack by a Boy Scout troop. - Yeah, my guess is this place is falling apart like a two-lock suitcase is. Maybe we should get the hell outta here. - Well, if it is now, we a better story than we (mumbles). - I'll be right with you. - Excuse me, Senator, oh, Miquel. - Jack. (gun thumping) (guests chattering) - [Miquel] Jack, what are you doing here? - Working, you don't have our hotel reservations? - That's not the point. I can always get you a room someplace. But I didn't think you were gonna come in the middle of this. - [Guest] I can't go. - We heard that there was trouble with the Sandinista. - It's much worse than you think, much, much worse. - [Jim] Are the rebels taking over? - I don't know anything, well, except all these men are members of the cabinet and the legislature. They're waiting for transportation to go to the airport. And if the government is leaving, what is left for us? (guests chattering) - Where's Somoza? - I don't know. I don't know anything about his plans. I don't know anything about Somoza. - Well, that's why we're here, to find out. - Do yourself a favorite, Jack, get out if you can, get out. - Not 'til I get a story. - You really should leave. (guests chattering) - Why don't you go and show us our room? - Please, Jack. (guests chattering) - Yes, I understand. Would you please tell the general that I'll be at the InterContinental until I hear from him? Gracias. (phone thumping) - How long do we wait before we decide whether to unpack? (Max knocking) (door rattling) - Max, this is Max Colby, General Somoza's aide. This is Liz Rush, Jim Conley. - Jack, it's all over. General Somoza's leaving tonight. Sent me to tell you to leave Nicaragua any way you can, as fast as you can. - Where's the general now? - At his headquarters, but not for long. - [Jack] Could you take me to him? - Impossible, everything's bedlam, there's no time. - Max, give me five minutes. - [Max] It's extremely dangerous. - It's dangerous just being in Nicaragua right now. Look, this may be Somoza's last chance to make a public statement. - All right, five minutes, he'll be mad as hell. - I'm going with you. - Me too. - No, you're not. - It's part of the deal, it's what we agreed on. - This may be the last five minutes Somoza has to make a statement. I'm not gonna jeopardize it by taking a stranger in there unannounced. - Then how do we know the statement he gives is the one you bring back? - I guess you'll just have to trust me, sir. (door squeaking) (door slamming) - There goes my story. (guns firing) - Don't count on it, it may be coming in the front door. (vehicle droning) (guns firing) (civilians screaming) (rebels chattering) (bomb exploding) (guns firing) (helicopter droning) (vehicle droning) (employees chattering) (Max knocking) - Come. (employees chattering) This is a hell of a time for you to show up. - Oh, I didn't wanna miss the party. - This is not a party, this is a wake. Hell, I have a seat on my plane, just one. Why don't you come out with me? - I don't think I can, I've got a crew. I've got two people I'm responsible for. - Jack, if they catch you, they're going to shoot you. - What the hell for, I'm not part of your government? - You are a friend of mine, to them it's the same thing. - [Jack] They're gonna shoot me for doing my job? - Jack, I could give you a whole list of people who are in exactly the same boat. But unfortunately, they are all dead. Look, I am sorry, I can't even talk to you now. I have got to finish what I'm doing. I can't even send anyone to look after you. If you don't come out with me, you are on your own, my friend. - Well, if that's where it is, okay. But where are you heading? - Ah, Miami first, I don't even know if the United States will let me stay. - Of course they will, why not? - Are you joking? I wouldn't be running now if Washington hadn't turned its back on me. Jack, we don't have any ammunition, any food, any medical supplies of any kind. And I'll tell you something else. There is a ship from Israel, full of everything that we need, bought and paid for in cash. The United States has put an embargo on it. They have closed every port in Central America to it. So I can't even move these supplies by land. Well, my government is dead, Jack. And the Sandinistas didn't kill it. The spineless wonder in Washington did. Don't they understand? Yes, today it is Nicaragua, but tomorrow it will be El Salvador, then Guatemala, then all of Central America! - Can I quote you on that, general? - You're God-damn right you can quote me. You just be sure you tell the world the truth about what happened here. But now you get out, you get your people and get out. But first, I wanna ask you something, Jack. I've asked at least 50 people this question, and no one gives me a straight answer. Is it possible that the president of the United States is a communist? - No, general, no, he's not a communist. He just takes bad advice from bad advisors. - And who elected those advisors, Jack? Now, any papers you have from me or my ministers, you better get rid of. No matter how innocent they are, the Sandinistas will use 'em as an excuse to put you right up against the wall. You better get going fast. (Jack speaks in Spanish) (footsteps thumping) Jack, Maria Cardena, have you tried to contact her? - No. - Don't, she is one of them. She always has been. - Is that true? - Of course it's true. I know from my intelligence reports. And if everything they said about me were true, she would have been in prison or executed three or four years ago for treason. But that's not something that I can blame on your president, is it? No, these are problems of my own making. (helicopter droning) Adios amigo. - Adios, goodbye, my friend. (door rattling) (employees chattering) (helicopter droning) (door thumping) (papers rustling) (bomb exploding) (guns firing) (fighters yelling) (paper rustling) (helicopter droning) - [Elizabeth] Is that Somoza and his family? - I suppose. (helicopter droning) - It's over, except for the shooting. What do we do now? (helicopter droning) - Get rid of the rest of those papers and go to the airport. (helicopter droning) - The brigade couldn't get through. The son of the bitch got away. - We'll get him, somehow, somewhere. We'll get that bastard. (helicopter droning) (guns firing) (bombs exploding) (guns firing) (fighters yelling) (bombs exploding) (guns firing) (fighter screaming) (bullets whistling) (bombs exploding) (guns firing) - [Ramon] Come on, Jack. - [Jack] Come on, let's go. (papers rustling) (bombs exploding) (guns firing) - [Jack] Hey! (guns firing) (bombs exploding) (vehicle roaring) (fighters screaming) - [Jim] Get down! (guns firing) (fighters yelling) (siren ringing) - They are all leaving. (guns firing) (fighters yelling) - We took the radio station. - [Leader] Good. - Somoza's headquarters are still surrounded by guards. We can't get through. - We'll go to the radio station tonight and announce the new government and Somoza's defeat. Somoza got away. - I saw. - These officials are scurrying like rats to the airport. (Maria chuckling) (bombs exploding) Well, it's all over now. And I don't wanna waste lives, but I want as many of them as possible. Tomorrow you take the airport. - It's gonna be their last stronghold, we need more weapons. - You'll get it. (guns firing) Wait, the American friend of yours is in Managua. - I know, I haven't seen him or heard from him. - I want him, he's unquestionably with the CIA, and he was one of the last people to see Somoza. We cannot stop Somoza, but whatever he told or gave to this Yankee must not leave Nicaragua. You know better than anyone else how to identify him. And you know what to do. (suspenseful music) (footsteps thumping) (upbeat music) (vehicles roaring) (vehicle honking) (vehicle roaring) (refugees chattering) - Senor Jack, I was waiting all night. You are in bad danger. The Sandinistas are looking for you to kill you. (vehicle droning) - Luis, is there a plane outta here? - Nada, no planes in, no planes out. (vehicle droning) - Wait here with Ramon, I'll be right back. (vehicle honking) (traffic droning) Come on, stick tight, now. (vehicle honking) (traffic droning) (refugees chattering) (door thumping) - Get out, this is a private. Jack, quick, this is a madhouse. (door slamming) - I have two Americans with me I'm responsible for. I've gotta get outta here. - I can't do nothing, it is total chaos. - Fernando, you are only chance. - You must help him, the mans from the hills will kill him. - Look, I've got cash, American dollars. - Jack, there's one plane coming in and a thousand people want seat, it is difficult. I'll do my best. (refugees chattering) - Fernando, do yourself a favor, buy a ticket too. - Thank you, amigo. The plane from Miami is still scheduled to arrive at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. Don't stop at the terminal, go directly to the plane, I'll be there. It's the last plane out. (hand thumping) (door rattling) - Muchas gracias mi amigo. (Fernando speaks in Spanish) If the Sandinistas come looking for me. - Don't worry, I'll tell them you went to the mountains for your health. (door slamming) (refugees chattering) - They're trying to take the cab. - Damn it, get out of here. (refugees chattering) (Jack speaks in Spanish) (Ramon speaks in Spanish) (refugee speaks in Spanish) (Ramon speaks in Spanish) (Jack speaks in Spanish) (traffic droning) Listen, I think I got a three tickets from Miami tomorrow morning, it's the last plane. - 24 hours of this, where the hell do we hide? - Well, what about the hotel? Maybe they haven't taken it over yet. - Hotel's too far away. If we leave here, I wanna make sure I know how to get back and can. - You know, Jack, there's this old place I know. It used to be a place for women. - Is it close? - Yeah. (Jack speaks in Spanish) (door rattling) (vehicle droning) (doors slamming) (vehicle droning) (employees chattering) (phone ringing) - Mr. Clarke, I have Mr. Murdock in Costa Rica for you. - Thanks. (employees chattering) Judd, Harry Clarke in Dallas, I got an emergency. You know what's happening in Managua? - And I know all hell's broken loose and nobody's sure who's in charge. - Jack Cox is down there. - Jack's there? Well, he's sure got a built-in radar for trouble. - He's got Liz Rush and a newspaper reporter along. Plane schedules are going to hell and I can't get through to him. - Got ya, all right, it'll take me two hours to get ready here and lift off outta San Jose. Figure another two hours flying time. That'll put me into Managua at approximately 9:15. Can you have Jack and his people there? - Most of the phone lines are down, but I'll keep trying. - Well, tell him to be on time. I won't be able to hang around that shooting gallery very long. (phone slamming) Hold down the fort, Bobby. (Bobby crowing) (aircraft droning) (vehicle droning) (birds chirping) (doors rattling) (birds chirping) - [Jim] No pets, no kids, but you can't beat the rent. - I wonder if they got room service. (birds chirping) (footsteps thumping) - Well, can you suggest somewhere else we might try? (phone ringing) (employees chattering) I see, thank you. (employees chattering) Well, the embassy hasn't seen them, and they said it wouldn't do any good to try any other government offices. There aren't any left to try. - Checked out of the InterContinental. Can't get through the airport and not at the embassy. Where in the hell are they? - Should I try some other hotels? - Yeah, try anything you can. We're runnin' outta time. (employees chattering) (phone ringing) (crickets chirping) (birds chirping) - [Rebel] How many do they have? - About 500 I think. They surround the airport in three lines. We could penetrate the first, possibly the second, then remain trapped between the second and third. - Somoza's offices are secure, the hotels too. - Maria, I can give you 100 more, but that's all. - [Maria] It's not enough, we only have 200 here now. - The buses, the hills, they are full of Somoza's men trying to hide or get to the airport with their families. Some are trying to walk to Costa Rica. We want every one of them. - We'd just be thrown away lives needlessly. - Try to break through the lines. They're too busy running to fight. Get to the old house and establish positions as close as possible to the airport. Raul, bring up 150 more, as many heavy weapons platoons as you can find. - If any more of the basters get away. - None can escape when we have the airport. (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) (vehicle droning) - Can I pour you a drink? - You know how to make an Irish Mexican? - No, shh. (vehicle droning) What was that? (vehicle droning) - My stomach growling. (vehicle droning) (birds chirping) (toads croaking) (suspenseful music) (weapons rattling) (suspenseful music continues) - There's troops moving outside. I hope their government troops. - What government? (footsteps thumping) How long do you think they can hold the airport? - God only knows. (footsteps thumping) (metal squeaking) (toads croaking) (footsteps thumping) (door squeaking) - It's me, Luis. - Oh. - I came as quick as I can. - You should be home away from all this. - There's just my brother and me, we have no home. - Where is your brother? - Hiding the taxi, but don't you want some rice and beans? (Jack laughing) - Heck, yeah. (suspenseful music) (footsteps thumping) (weapons rattling) (suspenseful music continues) (guns firing) - [Jack] Get down! (guns firing) (soldier screaming) (guns firing) (soldier screaming) (guns firing) - Americano, Americano! (guns firing) (bomb exploding) (guns firing) (soldiers chattering) (guns firing) (bullets whistling) (soldiers chattering) (guns firing) - Everybody all right? (soldiers chattering) (guns firing) - [Jim] I'm okay, how's the kid? (Luis speaks in Spanish) (soldiers screaming) (guns firing) (crickets chirping) (aircraft droning) (doors rattling) (vehicle droning) - [Sergeant] Are you the owner of this plane? - That's right. - We are commanding every plane on this field. - Not when it belongs to a U.S. citizen, you're not, not unless you wanna get your ass busted, Sergeant. This happens to be the personal plane of the U.S. ambassador who uses it every Sunday to go to a picnic at the beach. - This plane has no markings. - Better check it out with your commanders, Sergeant, or the next people you hear from will be a platoon of Marines coming to get it back. (sergeant speaks in Spanish) (vehicle droning) (footsteps thumping) I better get my papers (speaks in Spanish)? (footsteps thumping) (vehicle droning) (sergeant speaks in Spanish) (aircraft droning) (captain yells in Spanish) (aircraft droning) (guns firing) Fly for me, baby. (aircraft roaring) - [Jack] At least somebody got out. - [Elizabeth] I know a lotta somebody won't. (aircraft droning) (traffic droning) - I know you did what you could. You might have been stuck yourself. (aircraft droning) - Stuck, hell, shot. I got about eight holes in this plane that didn't come from woodpeckers. (aircraft droning) (refugees screaming) (aircraft droning) - Jack, this is all I can do. I'm going home now to wait either for the disaster or deliverance. - Good luck. (refugees screaming) (door thumping) (refugees screaming) (drawer rattling) (refugees screaming) (aircraft droning) (refugee yells in Spanish) (refugees yelling) (aircraft roaring) (fighters screaming) (guns firing) (guns firing) (bullets whistling) - Holy shit, tell 'em we're getting the hell outta here. (aircraft roaring) (refugees chattering) (aircraft roaring) (refugees chattering) - [Elizabeth] Okay, Jack, now what? - Well, I think I'll go scout around. - Want me to come with ya? - No, Jimmy, you stay here with Liz. I'll send speed back if I find us ride. And why don't you stay with a cab? (refugees chattering) Come on, short dog, we've got stuff here. (refugees chattering) - I've gotten word of several senators about Jack's predicament. State Department is aware of the situation, so is the White House. Call you as soon as I learn anything. (phone ringing) (phone slamming) Any luck? - Nobody's answering the phone anywhere in Managua. Washington will get 'em out, won't they? - I don't know, better stay on the phone. (employees chattering) (refugees chattering) - Let's go find Jack before we get trapped in here. - [Elizabeth] Got it. (refugees chattering) (soldier speaks in Spanish) - We are Americanos, Americanos, we have to get out of here. - My boss, we have to go find our boss. - [Soldier] Non comprendo. - God, why didn't I listen to my high school Spanish teacher, look? (soldier shouts in Spanish) - Well, we better pay attention to these. (soldier shouts in Spanish) - Wait, wait, I forgot my camera. - [Jim] Forget it! - I can't. (refugees chattering) (aircraft roaring) - Ned. - Jack, I didn't know you were here. We can talk while we're walking. - Where are we going? - The ambassador's plane, innit that what you're here for? - I didn't even know about it. - They're flying it in from Panama to take the American ambassador out and some of us who got caught this mess. The network said not to worry about cameras. Just get my hide on that plane. I recommend you do the same. (aircraft droning) (wheels squeaking) You coming? - Yeah, sure. Let me get my crew. - Well, they're gonna take off as soon as they load it, but I'll tell 'em you're coming. - I'll be right there, thanks. - [Announcer] Attention please, all U.S. press personnel, please board at the second terminal and have your press cards out. (aircraft droning) (refugees chattering) Attention please, all U.S. press personnel, please board at the second terminal. Have your press cards out. (tense music) - [Luis] Ramon, Jack says to come. - [Ramon] What? - [Luis] Jack says to come. (tense music continues) (fence rattling) (feet thumping) (aircraft droning) (suspenseful music continues) (wheels screeching) (door rattling) (aircraft droning) (suspenseful music continues) (wheels screeching) (suspenseful music continues) (aircraft roaring) (suspenseful music continues) (vehicle roaring) (suspenseful music continues) - If you ever prayed before, before you better pray now. (vehicle droning) (tense music continues) (aircraft roaring) (suspenseful music continues) Okay, stop, stop it here, come on. (wheels screeching) Come on, Conley, get your passport out. (aircraft roaring) (suspenseful music continues) Hey, slow down, will ya, for Christ's sake? Damn it, we're Americans! - We're Americans. Hey, we're Americans! (aircraft roaring) (Jim and Jack yelling) Are you all right? Sorry I hit you so hard, but that was kinda close. - Yeah, I'm fine, I owe you one, Jim, thanks. (aircraft droning) (footsteps thumping) - Get yourself killed, boss, then what do we do? - Probably be a lot better than getting you killed with me. Ramon, can you get us through that battle zone at the U.S. embassy in Managua? - Ci, I can get you anywhere. - How about San Francisco? - How about Tijuana? We can walk the rest of the way. (wind howling) - You okay? - [Jim] Yeah, yeah. - You sure now? - [Jim] Yeah! (aircraft roaring) - [Corporal] Sir, I have no instructions about your presence at the embassy. - Corporal, you see that? That identifies me as a U.S. citizen. That brass plaque right there identifies this as a U.S. embassy. I'm going in there because it's no longer safe out here. And I have the right to seek safe refuge with my countrymen. As a matter of fact, we all three do. Now, if you wanna shoot me as a trespasser, you go right ahead on, 'cause I to hell would rather have a Marine shoot me than one of those clowns in dirty fatigues with a red star on their hat. (siren ringing) - Private, escort these people to administration. (traffic droning) (vehicles honking) (gate rattling) - Adios. (Ramon speaks in Spanish) (Jack speaks in Spanish) - Ci, adios. - Adios. (traffic droning) (vehicles honking) - Thanks, guys. (traffic droning) (vehicles honking) - Thanks for the beer, Luis. (traffic droning) (vehicles honking) (gate rattling) (footsteps thumping) - [Elizabeth] Jack. (typewriter rattling) - I'm James Caldwell, Vice Council. - I don't think I've ever been so happy to see an American official. We couldn't give a damn if you were a tax collector, Jack Cox. - Is there something we can do for you? (vehicle honking) - Well, if we could speak in your office, Mr. Caldwell. - Mr. Caldwell, my husband is here. I must take care of some things at home. I will be back in an hour. - Of course, take an embassy car, it'll be safer. - Thank you. (traffic droning) - There is no need to go to my office. As you can see, I'm extremely busy. - We're America's citizens. We came here to do a documentary film. In the last 48 hours, we've been threatened and shot at, and we need to stay here 'til we can find a way to leave Nicaragua. - I'm afraid that's impossible. - What do you mean impossible? It's the most outrageous thing I've ever heard. - Mr. Cox, are you with the Central Intelligence Agency? (Jack and Elizabeth scoffing) - Good God no, I'm a writer. - You have been identified by a Lubbock Texas newspaper as an agent of the CIA. - Well then, some sorry son of a bitch has signed my death warrant with a typewriter. Now, that ought to be a reason to stay here. - No. - For God sakes, why? - Because you'll get us all killed. - It's him, it's him! - [Harry] Who, President Carter? - [Secretary] It's Jack. - Where the hell are you? - Well, we're in the U.S. embassy. - Damn, it's good to hear you, how can we get you out? I sent Murdock down there, but he had to run. - Yeah, we know about running, we wanna stop. Listen, you gotta put some pressure on the stuffed monkey that runs this place to keep us from getting thrown to the wolves. - Stay put, don't move. Chain yourself to a desk or some God damned thing while I got on it. (phone slamming) What's the guy's name from Houston? Bass, get me Grayson Bass. Tell the secretary it's a life or death emergency. And I gotta talk to him. (rebels shouting) (bomb exploding) (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (bomb exploding) (guns firing) (suspenseful music continues) (guns firing) (bomb exploding) (guns firing) (soldier screaming) (bomb exploding) (guns firing) (suspenseful music continues) (guns firing) (bomb exploding) (fighter yelling) (fighters yelling) (guns firing) - That was a close call. - Mr. Thumpkins always comes through. - Who's Mr. Thumpkins, the editor that got you into this mess? - He's a rabbit. I read about him every night to my kids at bedtime. - [Elizabeth] Mm. - How many children do you have? - Two, boys, you? - Nope, it's just me and my buddy here. And I've got two great cats. - What do you do with 'em when you go on the road? - My mom takes care of 'em, but I keep in touch. - Why don't you ask her how she does that? - Shut up, Jack. - Well? - I leave messages for them on my answering machine. Mom plays them back. Pretty silly, huh? - Mr. Thumpkins would understand. Next time you call 'em, send along his regards. - I will if we get outta here. - We're gonna get outta here, all right. In fact, I think I'll change into my cleanest dirty shirt. - That's good idea. - By the way, how many of those blue shirts you have with ya? - Six. (Elizabeth laughing) No, eight. - (laughs) Oh, God. What I really want is a bath. Suppose Mr. Caldwell will let us borrow a tub? - Yeah, but it'd probably be full alligators. - [Elizabeth] Anything wet. (James knocking) (fighters yelling) - The Sandinista government has been recognized by both Mexico and the United States. President Lopez Portillo's personal plane is bringing the new American and Mexican ambassadors to Managua to present their credentials this morning. - It's great news. - It'll be great news for the three of you too, if I can get you on that plane, I can get you out of the country. Now, you're gonna be leaving within an hour or two for the airport before dawn. (rebels cheering) (guns firing) - What the hell is that? - The victory celebration, we'll have to drive through it. (rebels cheering) (guns firing) I can go back and get ready to meet my new boss. (rebels cheering) (guns firing) - [Jack] Get down! (guns firing) (rebels cheering) (guns firing) - Jim? (guns firing) (rebels cheering) (guns firing) (tense music) (guns firing) - Now, if we run into any problems, show your press cards. (tense music continues) (guns firing) The Sandinistas love the U.S. press. (tense music continues) (rebels cheering) (doors slamming) (rebels cheering) (upbeat music) Keep your heads down until after we turned the corner. (rebels cheering) (vehicle droning) If I'm not mistaken, that is the Mexican delegation coming our way. (rebel shouts in Spanish) That's one of Somoza's cars. (vehicles droning) (rebels cheering) (wheels spinning) (rebels cheering) Oh, you son of a bitch. (rebels cheering) (wheels spinning) (hands thumping) (door rattling) - Well, at least he's human. (door slamming) - All right, give it a try. (vehicle roaring) Wait a minute, hold it, hold it, back it up, back it up. That's it, that's it. (vehicle droning) (rebels chattering) Thank you very much, I need you two back here, pushing. And the rest of you on this side, lifting it up. Got embassy business. Come on and help me, let's hurry it up. Here, I'll hold, go ahead. (rebels chattering) (vehicle revving) (Elizabeth muttering) - What? - Shut up, I'm praying. - Push it up together, all right. Gun her forward, let's go. (rebels chattering) (vehicles revving) There you are! (rebels cheering) (vehicles revving) Thank you very much. (rebels chattering) (vehicle droning) - Well, he's a damn good talker. Hey, Caldwell, did you ever work in a carnival? - When I leave the foreign service, if I survive the foreign service, Abilene will be my first stop. (vehicle droning) (suspenseful music) (aircraft droning) (vehicle droning) (suspenseful music continues) Smile and wave to the conquering heroes. (suspenseful music continues) (vehicle honking) Hello there, you dirty son of a-- - [Elizabeth] Hey, be careful. (suspenseful music continues) (vehicle honking) (suspenseful music continues) (rebels chattering) (vehicle droning) (suspenseful music continues) - I didn't know they had so many people. - They had enough to win a war. - You know, we've got a problem, that checkpoint right there. (suspenseful music continues) (vehicle droning) They're gonna either know us or have our descriptions. Is there any way to drive directly onto the field? - No, not anymore. They've set up a barricade and we are running out of time. That plane will take off in 12 minutes. - I don't believe it. - Nevertheless, that jet will leave. - No, not the plane, the kids, how in the hell do they survive all the craziness we put 'em in? (rebels chattering) (door rattling) - Senor Jack, I thought you were murdered. - (speaks in Spanish) Luis, listen, this plane leaves in 10 minutes. We've gotta get through that terminal. Do you know another way? - Ci, senor Jack, the garbage can, the tunnel. (vehicle droning) (suspenseful music) - Perhaps you'd better duck down again. (vehicle droning) (suspenseful music continues) (guard speaks in Spanish) (James speaks in Spanish) (hand thumping) (vehicle droning) (suspenseful music continues) (door rattling) (feet thumping) (door squeaking) (suspenseful music continues) (vehicle droning) - Thanks, Caldwell. - Good luck. (suspenseful music continues) (door thumping) (suspenseful music continues) (door slamming) - Come on, hurry up. (footsteps thumping) Hurry, come on. (suspenseful music continues) (vehicle droning) (wheels squeaking) (suspenseful music continues) (vehicle backfiring) (suspenseful music continues) (bonnet rattling) (door rattling) Come on, hurry up! (suspenseful music continues) (footsteps thumping) - Damn, do you know anything about cars? - No (speaks in Spanish). (suspenseful music continues) - There's a skipping somewhere. I just can't seem to get it to catch on, you know? And it marches not. (suspenseful music continues) (footsteps thumping) Wanna give it a little love? (soldier speaks in Spanish) (suspenseful music continues) (footsteps thumping) (suspenseful music continues) (aircraft droning) (triumphant music) - Okay, you two, go for the plane. Hold hands, act like you're married. Just get moving. - Gotcha. - But Jack, are you coming with us? - He's the boss. I'll save you a beer. - Yeah, go for it. Go fast, just don't go too fast. (suspenseful music) (aircraft droning) (vehicle droning) (rebels cheering) I owe you my life, amigo. - Will I ever see you against, Senor Jack? (Jack speaks in Spanish) (rebels cheering) (aircraft droning) - [Flight Attendant] Keep moving, please, keep moving, keep moving, please. (aircraft droning) (suspenseful music) - Jack. (suspenseful music continues) (somber music) - Damn world just ain't fair, is it? (somber music continues) (rebels cheering) - [Flight Attendant] Keep moving, keep moving, please. - Well, this is the last plane out for me. (suspenseful music) (aircraft droning) (rebels cheering) (suspenseful music continues) (triumphant music) - Jack. - [Jack] Looks like we're going home. (triumphant music continues) - (speaks in French) Here's that beer I promise ya. Welcome aboard. (triumphant music continues) (romantic music) - Adios mi amor. (romantic music continues) (aircraft roaring) (somber music) (upbeat music)
