Candace. Candace. Hey, Candace. What? Do you think that because time is an illusion and it's, like, not real that if you looked at mankind from, like, the fourth dimension's perspective, we'd just look like this weird, wormlike creature, where on one end we're old but then, on the other end, we're still young like a baby? And we're even connected to our moms and dads, because at one point, we were inside of them. And they're connected to their moms and dads and their moms and dads and so on and so forth till, like, the beginning of time. And it goes even bigger than that because-because we're all evolved from animals and all the animals are evolved from other animals, all the way back to, like, the first single-celled organism. And we're all part of this one living thing and we've just been dipped into the third dimension, so we're really just observing and interacting with other parts of ourselves. Do you ever think about that? Do I ever think, "Was I dipped into a third dimension?" No, I don't. I don't, Trevor. Good night. You don't think I'm dead, right? Cool.

What are you doing? She's calling our congressman 'cause we're sick of this shit. Okay, it says vote "yes" on prop 594. - TREVOR: What-what does that do? - That makes it a felony to be mean to people online. Well, that's a little insane, isn't it? What do you mean, insane? Insane? -Doesn't this all seem a little crazy? I mean, doesn't it seem like, at a certain point, we're just constantly looking for stuff to be upset about? So you think we should just be okay with how things are? No, no, no, no. No. Look, I know that the world has a lot of problems, and-and, you know... and it's good that people want to stop those problems, but, I mean, it's just every day, I can't... I can't be upset about everything every day. Can't I have outrage fatigue? BRLAYDEN: Yeah, must be tough for, like, a white male having to deal with all this stuff. Look, no, it's-it's not that. ALL: It is that. -Okay, maybe it is. I don't know. I'm just saying, is it a crime to not take everything seriously? Yes, dude. We don't even know how long we are here on this ball of dirt. Sometimes we aren't sure. And we have some responsibilities to make good content, to put it out there and to push the ball forward. - Everyone has something to say. - What are yougoing to say?
