(thunder crashing) (wind howling) (rain splattering) (wind whipping) (gentle orchestral music) Dammit, if you're just going to sit there getting drunk for the next five weeks, why the hell did you bring me? I brought you? Have you already forgotten this trip was your lousy idea? If I'd had any peace from you in the last two months, there's no way I'd be floating on this pile of crap. Cheers. (water lapping) (boat churning) (mysterious music) Diane. I told you a thousand times not to go up there. Naughty child. Now don't you ever do it again. Mommy look, there's something floating over there in the water. Where, dear? There. (boat churning) You're right. Edward, come over and have a look. Michelle, quickly, tell the captain there's something in the water. Tell him to stop the boat. (deep mysterious music) (plane engines roaring) [Radio Announcer] A Naval air force squadron takes off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their mission, to fly 160 miles east in straight formation. Then turn north, and return to base. In command was Colonel Charles C. Taylor, a Marine veteran with thousands of hours in the air, and now a Navy test pilot. All aircraft had been fueled to fly 1000 miles. Engines, instruments, radio, and safety equipment had been carefully checked out and reported in order. The temperature was 38. The day was bright with a few cumulus clouds, and there was a moderate northeast wind. That day, at precisely 3:15 p.m., the radio operator at Fort Lauderdale's control tower received a strange message. [Pilot] Commander flight 19 calling control tower. Fort Lauderdale. Flight 19, this is Fort Lauderdale's control tower, over. I can't understand what's going on. Apparently we've lost our course. We can't see ground. Repeat, we can't see a thing. What's your position, 19? We can't tell where we are, exactly. Tell him to turn west. Turn due west, 19, over. How in the hell can we find out where west is? Our magnetic gyroscopes have gone crazy. Nothing works. They're all showing different bearings. This is crazy. I can't see the water now. (tense music) The ocean has gone all white. My god. What's this? Flight 19, I've lost you. What's happening? Flight 19, come in. Over. Answer. Flight 19, what's happening? Come in. (static whirring and buzzing) (boat engine humming) - Captain look, a doll. - It looks very old. Some little girl must be very unhappy at this moment. Let me see her. I've never seen a doll like this before. It's very strange. - I found her, so she's mine. - Can I have her, please, Daddy? Of course she's yours, darling. Put her in the sun to dry out. (deep mysterious music) (boat churning) Hi. Can we take a look? Sure. Come on in. Hey, this is neat, a radar. Look, Michelle. These are the radios, right? Right. You're a pretty bright kid. What do you do on the boat? Well, I'm the navigator. I'm the radio operator, and the helmsman. On this boat you have to be able to do everything. I'd just like to be the captain. Your work must be fun. Sometimes, and sometimes hard. And at times it's very, very enjoyable. (boat churning) (water splashing) (Alan whistling) Now this new camera for stills will be yours. Michelle's gonna take this one. It's great, Dad. I can't wait to try it. Let's take all this and store it away in a secure place. Do you think we'll have bad weather? The captain says that in the zone we're entering we're liable to have rough seas. I see you're an expert sailor. Every time my father goes to photograph something interesting he takes us along, and I try to learn everything I can. Good idea. What's he gonna photograph now? Well, my father says that close to Andros Island there are some ruins. He thinks they're from an ancient city that sank under the sea. Do you think it could be Atlantis? I don't know, Billy. I don't know. But in that zone, the sea is very deep. Your father must be an expert diver. He is. So are Dave and Michelle. And what about you? Well, they think I'm too young, but I know a lot of things my brother, Dave, doesn't know, Tony. Sure, like coiling a rope. Look, how would you like me to teach you something else, Billy? Tonight I'll be on watch, and I'm gonna show you how to steer the boat. Really? Wow, Tony, thanks. How's your doll, angel? - Oh, she's nearly dry now. - She told me she's very hungry. Sure, angel. What would you like? A cookie for me and a piece of raw meat for her. Raw meat? I'm sure your dolly would rather have some cookies. Like these. No, she definitely said she wanted a good piece of meat, raw meat. Okay, honey, but tell her to chew it real well, Diane, 'cause it's tough. (mysterious music) (boat motor humming) How's it going, Gordon? Everything down here is okay, sir. Up to now. What do you mean by that? Please forget it, captain. It's just that I get a little jumpy around these waters. Gordon, we've cruised these waters about 50 times since you've joined us, nothing's happened yet. So forget your silly notions. I don't care if we come into these waters a thousand times one day it will happen. (tower whirring) [Pilot] Flight 57 here, reporting to Nassau Airport control tower. Go ahead, 57. We read you loud and clear. [Pilot] Flight 57, 200 miles out of Bermuda on regular route to the Azores. We're in the middle of some clouds and turbulence. Visibility, zero. Request weather information. Now listen flight 57, your weather's supposed to be good. We have no reports of bad weather in that area. [Pilot] Nassau control tower, 57 here. Having problems with controls. Listen to this. [Pilot] The instrument's malfunctioning. We're going into a spin. Can't control the plane. Mayday, mayday, mayday! We'll dispatch help immediately. We know your position. Hang in there 57, help is on its way. Nassau's control tower here, all ships in vicinity of Bermuda-Azores run, look for survivors, Super Constellation flight 57. (boat humming) (water splashing) (typewriter keys clicking) (boat humming) Captain, reporting commercial flight 57 lost. A Super Constellation with 42 persons aboard, including five crew. Captain, the majority of those missing are family members of Naval personnel, sir. Here it is, at the center of the vertex formed between Puerto Rico, Miami, and the Bermuda islands. The Bermuda Triangle. (deep mysterious music) (boat churning) Where did you put my seasick pills? Oh, I'm sorry, Peter, I forgot to buy them. Dammit Sybil, you did it on purpose. No, I told you, I just forgot. I told you three times, I even wrote it down for you. Stop shouting. They must have some here, ask Caption Briggs. Ask Captain Briggs. I doubt they even have an aspirin on this tub. I hope you're the first to get seasick. Peter, please. You promised to stop. To the great doctor, Peter Marvin. Hmm. - Forget all that. - Why torment yourself? You know you were brilliant. Brilliant, huh? I certainly killed that child brilliantly. Every day, hundreds of children die on operating tables all over the world. Sure, they die, but they're not murdered. All right, you killed her. We all know that you killed her, but she's not coming back. Even if you drink every damn bottle of whiskey in the world, she's not coming back. Edward is right, the only way you'll ever stop is when you get that through your head. Edward, my new psychiatrist. Jesus. That fool of my half-brother only thinks of finding lost cities out there. And you're telling me what he says? Do yourself a favor, Sybil, and leave me alone. Worry about that crazy brother-in-law of yours. Would you like a drink? To us, my friend. (deep mysterious music) That one is the Big Bear. And this one is the Northern Star. She's the faithful companion of all seamen, because she always shows us the north and helps to guide us safely to port. You know, it's wonderful to look at the sky. In the big cities, nobody ever worries about it. It's been a long time since I last watched it. All of these stars are my friends, and every night I watch them. Hmm, maybe someone up there is watching us too. (boat churning) (ice clinking) You know what I'm thinking, Uncle Peter? No. What Diane? One of these nights, one of those fearsome animals are going to come out and grab us. Yes, and the first one he's going to eat is your Ant Sybil. Yeah, and Billy. And then, Dave. And last, Michelle. Diane, you left your doll in the hallway. No, Mommy. I just left her on that chair, over there. (boat churning) (water splashing) I'm going to punish you so that you don't ever hide from me again. [Radio Announcer] The Constellation disappeared in exactly the same unexplainable way as many other hundreds of boats and planes before. Searching for more accurate information, this reporter was handed an official-looking document, which read as follows. "The Bermuda Triangle is a zone situated in front of the southeast Atlantic coast off the United States, where dozens of ships, boats, and planes have disappeared without a trace. Most of these disappearances have occurred in this century, although losses go back... - Good evening, everyone. - More than 200... [All] Good evening. Isn't Peter coming to have dinner with us? I don't know - and I don't care. - What really is out there in the Bermuda Triangle? Well, I know what's out there. (light jazz music) Sea monsters, and creatures from outer space. And also the devil, Uncle Peter. (pan clattering) Well, there've always been so-called disappearances. And as long as there's the possibility of human or mechanical error, there always will be. I don't think that's a viable explanation for all the accidents in this part of the ocean. Hmm. Talk, talk, talk. The solution of the mystery is related to the sea. Maybe there's a big magnetic field under the ocean. What do you think, captain? Well, centuries ago, people let their imaginations wander. And they attributed the disappearance of vessels to hurricanes, pirates, or frightening sea monsters. Of course that's nonsense. All those accidents have been caused by human or mechanical error, Like Mr. Marvin said. Huh, the supernatural's only a myth. That plane must've crashed into the sea. Most probably. What a shame, you're spoiling a perfectly spooky trip. Sorry for putting a damper on your fun. (birds screeching) (Diane yelling) (Diane crying) Diane. - What happened? - Oh my god, - what's happened? - How is she? (Diane crying softly) [Ed] Don't worry, everything's all right now. (Diane crying softly) [Kim] Calm down, dear. (boat churning) (water splashing) What do you say now, Captain? It's strange. (water lapping) (boat churning) (deep suspenseful music) What's happened, Peter? Their throats. They all had their throats cut, as if they've been bitten. (deep suspenseful music) (Diane crying) - All right, calm down. - It's all over now. Give her some water. (eerie music) Kim. Look at her mouth. (eerie music) (boat motor rumbling) (eerie buzzing and whirring) (man yelling) (boat churning) (water lapping) There's a light at port. Can't make out any baring lights. It could be a fishing or a rescue boat. Get towards it. (boat churning) (Simon whistling) Who's there? It's Dave, Simon. Oh my god, you scared the hell out of me, boy. Sorry, Simon, I only wanted a glass of milk. Well, don't ever come up on me like that again. You could've given me a heart attack. You're as white as that milk. What's the matter? Oh, nothing. Seasick? No, I never get seasick. I had a nightmare. There was this pilot, he had a horrible look on his face. He came floating out of the water, like he was trying to tell me something. Please David, you better stop. I don't wanna know. Otherwise, I'm gonna have all kinds of nightmares when I go to bed. S-O-S, they're calling for help. Answer it, so they know we've seen their signal. Tony, take the helm. (boat churning) Gordon? Yes, captain? Full speed ahead. Full speed ahead. Okay, Captain. (boat motor accelerating) Follow the light. (deep somber music) Edward, where are you going? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I'm gonna see why they accelerated the engines. (boat churning) That's strange. What's strange, captain? The radar doesn't show anything. What's going on, Captain Briggs? Look over there, Mr. Marvin. (boat churning) (water lapping) What's happening, Dad? It seems a ship is signaling us. We're going to approach it. Do you think they need help? I don't know, son. I suppose so. (boat churning) Something very weird is happening. This is just not possible. What do you mean? What are you talking about? They identified themselves as the City of Glasgow. That boat disappeared. They were going from uh, Philadelphia to England. They had 480 people aboard. (boat churning) (water splashing) Tell Gordon to reduce speed. Gordon? Gordon, minimum speed. Aye-aye, sir. (boat churning) (boat motor slowing) Any sign? Nothing. (boat churning slowly) (air horns blow distantly) Whoever they are, we're gonna give a signal every two minutes. (air horn blaring) (boat churning) Mark. (dial whirring) (short beep) (boat creaking) Starboard, all starboard! (boat creaking) (objects clattering) (boat creaking) Mommy! Mommy. Mommy. Oh, everything's okay. There's nothing to be worried about. It's all right. (boat creaking) (objects clattering) (Sybil gasps) (boat creaking) (objects clattering) Peter, what's going on? Just how in the devil do you expect me to know? Come on, have a drink with me. It'll be a lot easier for you to enter hell. (objects clattering) (boat churning) (water lapping) (slow somber music) - Black Whale ill here. - Black Whale ill here. If someone reads me, please come in, over. Black Whale ill here. Black Whale ill here. If someone reads me, please come in, over. Captain? Yes? Any sign of that boat, or whatever we did see last night, Captain Briggs? No, Mr. Marvin, nothing. Sir, we're continuing - on our course. - This is Black Whale III. And we'll soon be arriving in the area that you wanna explore. Do you read me? Please come in, over. Black Whale ill here. Black Whale ill here. If someone reads me, come in, over. I've studied the ocean all my life. I've been in some rough situations, you know uh, storms, fogs, even a few hurricanes. But, last night, I don't know what to make of it. I felt as if something were playing with us. Listen, Mr. Marvin, I know last night the whole thing was frightening, but I have to believe that there's an explanation. There's fog on these waters even at this time of the year. And the rocking, it must've been caused by underwater currents. (boat churning) You and your father better leave the sea in peace. And not tempt the supernatural forces in it. What do you mean? What supernatural forces are you talking about? Listen, boy, not all the seas are the same. Look at this one, for example. They call this the sea of the gulf weeds. It's so calm. It's as if you could see your own life in it. I tell you boy, leave the sea and its secrets in peace. We're only gonna take some underwater photographs. - Respect its secrets. - Don't provoke its wrath. (slow suspenseful music) (eerie music) (plane roaring) I must confess that I almost decided not to make this flight when I found out the pilot was a woman. Don't worry, sir. I have more than 3,000 hours of flying time, mostly on charter flights to these islands. I'm fully licensed. Bonanza extra alpha tango echo Victor here, calling Nassau's control tower, on regular route to Grand Turk. Visibility and weather excellent. Arriving Grand Turk ETA, mm, 1300 hours GMT. Now this is our actual position, and this is the place you wanted to explore. Ed, do you have an extra set of diving equipment? Peter, are you coming down with us? - Peter, diving? - Are you kidding? If he swallowed with some water without whiskey he would definitely die. Hm, no, not for me. Just for you. They could take you down to discover the ruins and forget you in a catacomb of Atlantis. I don't need to find any more ruins. With you I have enough. (laughs) Take Peter along as a shark repellent. Not even they would take him. (Giggles) Thanks for your kindness, dear sister-in-law, but I can already see your brave and courageous husband floating like a toad into the mouth of a shark. Poor animal, he will die of indigestion. (Ed laughs) (light upbeat jazz music) The thing I like best about being a sailor is having a girl in every part. How many girls do you have, hm? Oh, I've already lost count. But right now I'm only interested in one. [Billy] Only one? That's not enough for a sailor. I have one near the house and two at school. That's what he says. None of those girls ever pay him any attention. - [Billy] Oh yeah? - I've kissed them all. (laughs) Don't worry, it's the same with me. [Billy] Huh, she's just jealous because she hasn't got a boyfriend. Diane, what advice could you give me so that I get a girlfriend? Well, all of us women are different. We're already superior to men. If you love the sea so much, you should look for a mermaid. (Alan laughs) (plane engine humming) What's wrong? It's nothing, don't worry. It's just an air pocket. I must've slept a while. We're almost there. (radar beeping) The radar's working perfectly now. There's a point on the screen that looks like a small aircraft. (radar beeping) (plane roaring) (whirring and buzzing) Attention, bonanza extra alpha tango echo Victor here. This is an emergency. I repeat, mayday, mayday, mayday. I don't understand what's happening. Some strange force controlling the plane. No visibility. Can't control plane. Attention, Bimini control tower. Mayday, mayday, mayday. Something strange is going on. It's light. It's light. (radar whirring) (boat churning) Radar lost 'em. We are arriving now. Gordon, Gordon, minimum speed. Tony, 12 degrees at starboard. Alan, did you fix the radar? It's working fine. Something strange happened. I saw a light. I thought it was a plane. Then, a larger light appeared, and they fused together, and they both disappeared. Tony, go to the anchor, take the helm. 20 fathoms, 30. We're in the zone. Gordon, Gordon. Stop the engines. (water splashing) Tony, drop the anchor. [Tony] Yes, captain. (anchor splashes) (water sloshing) Good luck. Thanks a lot, Alan. Maybe I'll capture your future wife. What type of mermaid do you prefer? Short or long tail? One like yours will do. (Chuckles) Aren't you going with them, Mr. Marvin? Do I look like a fish or something similar? Why don't you go down? Who, me? No way, I'll stay in the galley. (water sloshing) (tense somber music) (gentle synth music) (water gurgling) (Simon whistling) (tense scary music) (Simon knocking on door) (haunting music) (water gurgling) (tense suspenseful music) (gun firing) (tense suspenseful music) (gun firing) (slow dramatic music) (water lapping) I would never have believed it. Peter Marvin studying a Marine navigation chart. I simply wanted to know the distance to the islands, especially the closest one to the boat. Why all the interest? Are you thinking of visiting one? I was calculating the time it would take to reach the closest one, by swimming. By swimming? What kind of a foolish idea is this one, Peter? My dear, have you forgotten that I was champion in long distance swimming in college? Sure, in your bathtub. All right, but doesn't anyone think here? Those planes and those boats disappearing, and last night this floating bathtub turned into a roller coaster. And those birds. What about those birds? And the doll. Where did it come from? Have you ever really looked at it? I can assure you, the thing is alive. He's nuts. I swear he's gone crazy. Hmm, maybe, but I'm getting off this floating tub. I ordered Captain Briggs to take me to the nearest island. This decision deserves a toast. (deep somber music) (deep eerie music) (water sloshes) What the devil are you doing there? Oh, Mr. Peter, thank you. You saved my life. The door closed on me. What a fright. Oh god, what a fright I had. I was so cold. What a freeze and scare I had. I don't know why you got so scared. You won't die frozen. You'll die in a different way. (tense scary music) That child is a devil. (tense suspenseful music) (water sloshing) They dove long ago. I don't think they have much air left. (water sloshing) (eerie music) (sea quaking) (boulders crashing) (water sloshing) (water gurgling) (water sloshing) (water gurgling) There was a sea quake. Michele is trapped under some rocks. We need new tanks. Hurry. Will she be all right, Alan? What about Edward? Dad's down there with her. Don't worry. We'll rescue her in a moment. (water sloshing) Get me another tank, a full one. (water sloshing) Tony, pass a long cable to the bow winch. We're gonna try and pull that rock away from Michelle's leg. Gordon, give me a new tank. (water gurgling) Start the engine. When Tony signals you, full speed ahead. Simon, take the helm. 10 degrees at starboard. Me? Yes, you. [Simon] Hmm. Well, okay. Ready? (water gurgling) (water sloshing) (water gurgling) (engine clattering) (water gurgling) Full speed ahead. Okay. (water gurgling) (deep scary music) Slow the engines. Gotcha. (slow tense music) (gun fires) (slow tense music) [Alan] Her legs are badly hurt, careful. [Kim] Easy, please. Oh, my poor darling. (water sloshing) They're completely destroyed, right? I hope this floating tub of yours has the necessary first aid, my friend. What do you need? First of all, an anesthetic, or some sleeping pills. Anything to kill the pain. (slow somber music) Please help my sister, Uncle Peter. I'll do what I can. Kim, you're going to help me. Thank you, Peter. (Michelle moaning) (Michelle gasps) [Peter] Please leave the room. I don't need an audience. - Here, come. - Out. Do you think you uh, can do anything? Her wounds are serious. All' I can do is stop the hemorrhaging until we reach a place where I can operate. The nearest island is Bimini. Briggs is taking us there as soon as possible. Tony? Alan, try and make contact with Bimini. Yes, captain? Tony, get that anchor up. Gordon. Yes, captain? - Gordon... - Attention, Bimini - this is an emergency. - Get those engines moving. Aye-aye, sir. This is Black Whale [I out of Miami. This is Black Whale [I out of Miami. We have a very seriously injured girl... Get that anchor up! We have a... (anchor creaking) Please come in, over. Gordon? - Gordon, full speed ahead. - She needs medical attention. Right away, sir. If someone is listening to us, please come in, over. There's a lot of interference. Keep trying. (boat churning) Thank God everything's over. When I saw her in the middle of that avalanche, I thought she'd never make it. Michelle's wounds are very serious. Don't worry, Michelle will be all right. It's too bad it's all over. Now we'll have to go back. Listen, boy. It's better to be on firm ground than aboard a black whale with 13 passengers. What color would Simon be when he dies? Purple or white? Diane, why must you always be talking about people dying? Because today I was talking to a man none of you know, and he told me about it. You've got the worst habit of inventing all kinds of lies. They're not lies. I know how everybody's going to die. Simon is going to be the first. (dishes clattering) (water sloshing) (boat churning) (ice clinks) (water sloshing) (boat churning) How's Michelle, Pete? I'm sorry, Sybil, her legs can't be saved. I didn't wanna tell Edward and Kim. It's likely they'll amputate when we get to the hospital, if she arrives alive. Without amputating her legs, I cannot stop the hemorrhaging, and that's a decision I can't make. (boat churning) (water sloshing) You've got to tell them the truth. They have a right to know. I'll do it later on. Why do you hesitate? Aren't you sure about it? Are you afraid of making a mistake again in the diagnosis? Are you afraid they'll save her legs in the hospital and you'll be humiliated? Calm down, Sybil. You don't have to get angry. I can't be mistaken. It's the truth, I'm sorry. I haven't told them because, because I respect their sorrow at this moment. You've got to tell them, you have to. Thanks for the drink. I'll ask the captain where we're headed for. (boat churning) (water splashes) How's Michelle? Oh, I don't know. Peter has done what he could. We're already on our way to Bimini. We'll be at the island by dawn. Michelle will be in the hospital tomorrow morning. Bimini's the closest island. Why not Nassau? It'd take another night to get there. Do you think they'll have a good hospital on the island? There's a Naval base there with a whole complete clinic. You're the authority on board, right? - That's right, I am. - Say what's on your mind. What I wanna say is that I don't like any of this. The fog, the boat shaking, the sea turning into a strange color. I don't really know what happened down below, but the sooner we get out of this inferno, the better. Mr. Marvin, this is not the right time to find an explanation of the Bermuda phenomenon. What we must do is get Michelle to a hospital, and Bimini is the nearest island. - Forget about Michelle. - She can't be saved. She could die any moment now. What in the devil are you saying? I'm a doctor, even though I might not look like one, Captain Briggs. And I know that if we don't amputate both of her legs she won't survive, and I don't dare to do it aboard. Well, if you're a doctor and so sure of what you're saying why don't you try saving her? I've done whatever I could do. All that remains is to wait for the end. Doctor, I feel sorry for you. You're a coward. (deep slow suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling) (slow somber orchestral music) (thunder rumbling) (wind whipping) A storm is approaching. (wind howling) The barometer has gone down a lot. And the north wind is blowing stronger. Have you made contact with Bimini? Not with Bimini or any other island. I don't know what the hell's going on. We can't contact anyone. Hey boy, come here a minute. Here, Dave, you might wanna read this during the storm that's gonna hit. I can smell storms, boy. And I promise you that we'll be in a middle of a big hurricane before midnight. (wind howling) (boat churning) (Ed groans) (wind howling) (boat churning) (footsteps clicking) Billy go to your cabinet and stay there. I don't want anybody on deck. Yes, captain. (knocking at door) It's me, Alan. Please, don't be alarmed. We're going to have a storm. Just keep your portholes closed and nothing will happen. All right, Alan. Thank you. Where's your husband? Where there's a bottle of whiskey. (wind howling) (boat churning) (knocking at door) Yes. Who is it? Mr. Marvin, please don't bother to open the door. Is Diane with you? Yes. It's just that we're gonna have a little storm and the captain wants everyone in their cabin. Please keep your portholes holes locked. They're closed. How's Michelle? She's still unconscious, but her breathing is better. If there's anything I can do, something you need. Thanks, Alan. Please let me know. For worrying about Michelle. (boat churning) (wind howling) Diane, what're you doing out of bed? - Mommy, she's thirsty. - I'm going to the kitchen. The poor little one is scared. Diane, leave that doll alone. Get back to your bed, immediately. (intense mysterious music) (thunder crackling) And at what time have you calculated our sinking, my dear friend? I don't really know. But, what're you worried about? You're already drowned, in liquor. (wind whipping) (thunder crackling) Watch the radar. (wind howling) (water sloshing) (phone buzzing) Gordon. Yes, captain? Slow down the engine. Yes, sir. Right away. (wind howling) (water splashing) (objects clattering) (water splashing) (Michelle groans softly) (thunder cracking) Mark, we're heading for some rocks. Impossible, the only rocks marked in this area are 70 miles away from here. Then the compass is showing the wrong route completely. Look out, Tony, all the way to starboard. (water splashing) More rocks on bow and starboard. Turn to port side. (water splashing) (water spraying) (wind howling) (water spraying) (phone buzzing) Captain, the starboard engine's out. The propeller must have hit something. Do the best you can. We'll have to manage with the other one. We also have a leak down here, but I think I can handle it. Tony, go down and help Gordon. Yes, sir. Get the drainage pumps working. (wind whipping) Alan, the helm isn't responding. It must have been damaged from the blow. We're moving away from the rocks, Mark. We're drifting, but at least not toward the rocks. (water splashing) (phone buzzes) Gordon, we have no steering. Reduce speed to minimum. Yes, captain. Right away. (thunder crackling) Alan, come and help me throw two short anchors at starboard. Aye-aye, sir. Let's see if we can compensate for the deviation of the other engine. (thunder rumbling) (wind howling) I don't like any of this. Something sinister is following us. (thunder crackling) Ed, where's Diane? In her bed. Where are you? Diane? (wind howling) (water splashing) (thunder cracking) We're in its cross currents. We won't be able to hold on much longer. Gordon, stop the engine. (thunder rumbling) (water splashing) [Kim] Diane? Diane? Diane? (footsteps sloshing) [Ed] Kim, wait! (thunder cracking) [Kim] Diane? [Ed] Kim! [Kim] Diane? (thunder cracking) Stop! - Diane! - Kim! Diane! (water rushing) - The Marvins fell overboard. - Throw them a life preserver. (thunder rumbling) (water splashing) Gordon, keep the child down below. Mr. Marvin! (thunder rumbling) (wind howling) Help me lower the boat. (boat creaking) (thunder cracking) Tony, you're coming with me. (thunder rumbling) (water splashing) (wind howling) (thunder cracking) Alan, shoot up flares every 10 minutes so that we can get back. Okay. [Mark] Let's go. (boat humming) (wind howling) (thunder rumbling) Mr. Marvin? Mrs. Marvin? Mr. Marvin. Mrs. Marvin. Mr. Marvin! Mrs. Marvin! (wind howling) (thunder crackling) Look, captain, a life preserver. (wind howling) It's ours. (wind howling) (flare gun bangs) (thunder crackling) (slow somber music) (water sloshing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (water sloshing) What's the matter? It's Simon. You better come to the kitchen. (water sloshing) (slow somber music) Poor Simon, he fell with the bottle and cut his neck. Alan, somehow we have to make contact with Bimini, or some other place. You want me to tell "em what's been going on? Do any of you really know what's going on? Gordon, cover him and put him in his bunk. (slow somber orchestral music) I need a drink. (doll thuds) (eerie music) (water sloshing) - Oh, poor little thing. - You were thirsty, right? (tense scary music) Once and for all, I'll throw that goddamn doll into the ocean. Gordon, let's check the damages. Come with me. (tense scary music) (Michelle groaning) (gentle somber music) Mommy and Daddy? (groans) Dave, where are they? Where are Mommy and Daddy? Have you felt much pain? They took them. They? Who are they? The same ones that are going to take all of us. But they are not dead, you know. They are with them, down below. Diane, don't say that. Don't pay any attention. The child's a little nervous. What happened? (gentle music) Dave, tell me the truth. Michelle, last night during the storm, Mom and Dad fell into the sea. Oh my god. (gentle music) Dave, if I should also die, take care of Billy and Diane. You're already a man. (gentle music) The main leak is covered by a plate we welded on. There were other small breaks where the water's coming in. But as long as the drainage pump is working, there's no problem. That's good news, but they have to be fixed. But the most important thing right now is to check the propeller in the helm. You know, captain, I've been observing that child. Maybe I'm crazy, but she hasn't stopped whispering to that horrible doll. I can almost swear that the thing answers her. - That's enough, Gordon. - Leave that child alone. She's as frightened as we are. Captain, that girl is the devil. Now will you stop the nonsense, Gordon? Fix the helm of the propeller, and hurry it up. (boat engine whirring) (motor whirring) [Mark] Ready? [Gordon] Okay. (motor whirring) (water splashes) (water gurgling) (motor whirring) (water gurgling) (motor whirring) (water gurgling) (motor whirring) (water gurgling) (motor whirring) (sparks sizzling) (engine rumbling) (eerie music) (engine rumbling) (eerie music) What the hell's happening? I don't know. I can't understand. I can't stop the engine. Cut the fuel line. I already did, and nothing happened. (engine rumbling) (eerie music) (engine clicks off) Did you push the start button? No, captain, I didn't do it, she did. Ask her, you'll see. She'll tell you. She said we all have to join the others. What others? All her friends. She told me Mommy and Daddy are there, and also Simon. And you know something? Gordon is on the way there too. What is she talking about? I don't know, Alan. I don't know. Attention, this is an emergency. Attention, this is an emergency. This is Black Whale [I out of Miami. Black Whale I'll out of Miami. We're damaged and adrift. We're damaged and adrift. We've got a seriously injured girl aboard. If someone's listening, please come in, over. (static crackling) Attention, this is an emergency. This is an emergency. Mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday. This is Black Whale [I out of Miami. Black Whale I'll out of Miami. We're damaged and adrift. We're damaged and adrift. We've got a very seriously injured girl on board. We've got a very seriously injured girl on board. If someone is listening, please come in, over. (radio whirring and beeping) Nothing, captain. (indistinct chatter on radio) [Ship Captain] S-O-S, this is an emergency. This is cargo ship Sandra on normal route from Savannah, Georgia to Puerto Cabello, Venezuela. Our position is 30 degrees southeast of Andros. Strange things are to happening to the ship. Oh my god, it's coming toward us. It's on top of us! [Olson] Lieutenant Olson, reporting to Coast Guard station. Found the Conamerica IV mysteriously abandoned 400 miles southeast of Bermuda, other day. (radio whirring) [Pilot] Attention Nassau, flight 57 calling. Attention Nassau, got problems with controls. Instruments malfunctioning. (radio whirring) That was flight 57, captain. [Alan] Mayday, mayday, mayday. Black Whale III here, Black Whale ill here. We've got a seriously injured girl aboard. If someone reads me, please come in, over. (radio whirring) (indistinct chatter over radio) Don't say anything to anyone. Do you hear me? Why did we hear the communication of flight 57? Why did we hear our own communication? I don't know, Alan. I don't know. (indistinct chatter over radio) (radio clicks off) (gentle somber music) She's going into a coma. You have to be strong, children. You have to do something. You can't let her die. I'm sorry, Dave, only a miracle could save her. And I don't believe in miracles. You said that amputating her legs could save her. Why don't you try it? Without the necessary instruments, I don't dare. She's very weak. I don't think she can survive. Uncle Pete, we can't just stand here and not do anything. We've got to attempt everything. (gentle somber music) We have to take her to land on one of the boats. You're right. Let's go and talk to the captain. (gentle somber music) There's nothing they can do. Michelle, you're beyond hope. It's the only chance, captain. Whatever happens, we are ready to take the risk. Don't you see? We must do it. Please. Every minute we lose is valuable to Michelle's life. As much as you do, I want Michelle to live. And if you're determined, there's nothing I can do. It's not necessary for them to take the risk. We're about 80 miles from Bimini. With the Zodiac at full speed, I can put her in land in about six hours. Then I'll let the Coast Guard know and they can come and rescue you. Thank you, but someone has to go with you to take care of Michelle. I'll go. (boat motor humming) All right now, watch your step. Slowly. Be careful. You've got enough gas for 20 hours. More than enough. (boat motor humming) [Mark] Tony, come with me to the stern of the yacht. [Tony] Aye-aye, sir. [Mark] Meanwhile, you're in charge of the two children. (boat motor humming) Goodbye, Michelle. (boat motor humming) (water splashing) (water gurgling) (sparks sizzling) (water sloshing) (sparks sizzling) What stupidity. When I told them I wanted to go to land, they should have sent me in that boat. They should have left my niece in this floating coffin. The logical thing is to save the living, not the dead. Please shut up, Peter. It makes me sick to hear you talk like that. I can't stand it. Huh, I am the one who can't stand you. You should be at the bottom of the sea, not Ed and Kim, in the company of your relatives. (tense mysterious music) They're going to take all of us, and you're next, and you're next, Aunt Sybil. (tense mysterious music) (motor buzzing loudly) Ready. God willing tomorrow the helm will be fixed. [Billy] Do you think they're in Bimini by now, captain? Probably. By this time, your sister should be in the hospital in the hands of some good doctors, Billy. (water sloshing) Don't worry, Dave. Probably the captain and I were wrong in figuring the time, but we'll make it. (wind howling) Uncle Peter. I wanna talk to you about my sister. I think that from all that's been happening, she's going crazy, or she's bewitched. Well, that's not surprising. All of us here are already crazy or bewitched. We're a lost cause, my dear, Billy. The yacht is out of order and nobody's coming to our aid. Your parents are dead. Gordon's dead. Simon's dead. I wonder who'll be next? (slow haunting music) (wind howling) (slow eerie music) It's them, Aunt Sybil, it's them. (slow eerie music) Tony, have you seen my wife? The last time I saw her, uh, she was at the stern, having a cup of coffee, on the upper deck. (water sloshing) (wind howling) (tense mysterious music) (eerie music) (water splashing) Dave, where are we? Please, don't worry. Alan is taking us to a place where they're gonna take care of you. It's late, Dave, too late. Alan, why haven't we arrived yet? What's happened? Are we lost? Please Dave, be patient. Have faith in God. He'll get us there, you'll see. (water splashing) (boat churning) We'll look again. It's useless. I'm afraid my wife met the same fate as the others. (boat churning) (wind whipping) (slow somber orchestral music) My sister is dead. (water sloshing) She's dead, Alan. Michelle has died. Oh my god, why? Why? We're all gonna die, Alan. (water sloshing) (gentle music) (boat motor clicking) (gentle orchestral music) (water sloshing) (tense mysterious music) (tense suspenseful music) (water sloshing) (footsteps clicking) (water splashing) (wind whipping) (water sloshing) (deep somber music) (eerie haunting music) This is Captain Mark Briggs of the Black Whale III. This is a general call, mayday, mayday. S-O-S, S-O-S. (indistinct radio chatter) This is an emergency. Do you read me? (boat churning) This is Bimini, this is Bimini, captain. We received your S-O-S. Please give name and position again. Bimini, Bimini, thank God you finally heard us. This is Captain Mark Briggs of the Black Whale III. This is Captain Mark Briggs of the Black Whale III. (radio whirring) That guy must be wrong, or you didn't understand the message. The Black Whale I'll disappeared with its entire crew, and a family named Marvin, about 12 years ago, my friend. (daunting orchestral music) (gentle orchestral music) (eerie music) (gentle orchestral music) (funky upbeat music)
