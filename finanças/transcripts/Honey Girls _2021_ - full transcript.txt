So Mac spoke to a reporter about the contest, and she wants a quote. - Mac can handle. - Oh, my gosh, you were terrific. You looked amazing. You sounded amazing. You are amazing. Are you kidding me with this? I need to spend the next month rehearsing for the tour, not babysitting a bunch of teenaged contest winners. The label wanted to kick off the release with a major promotion. You... We... agreed to this months ago. - Don't worry, we'll handle everything. - Yes, everything. Everything. What are you watching? Can you teach me that Fancy G song called "Louder"? I wanna audition for the contest. Can you teach me how to play it? Sure. I think it goes like this, in the key of D-flat.

Are you Lexi? Here you go. I work with Fancy G. You made the top ten of the competition. - Oh, my... - I'm Jenny, I work with Fancy G. Congratulations. You made the cut. You've been chosen as one of the contestants. Maya? This is on behalf of Fancy G. I'm with Fancy G. Here's your glitter invitation. - Oh, hi. Brit! Brit! - Is Brit there? Thank you. - I made it! - We did it! We did it! - Thank you. - Thank you. Dad! I'm going to L.A.! Oh, my gosh! - Nice kicks. Houston, huh? - Yeah. I was there for a math decathlon last year. Yeah, H-Town. I'm Alex. Where are you from? Maya. Atlanta. - No way. My aunt and uncle live there. - Really? Yeah. And how about you? Charlie, from Brooklyn. Brooklyn, that's sick. - This house is sick. - Yeah. Right? I'm sorry, this is where we're staying? We're sleeping here? In Fancy G's house? No. But don't worry. You'll be staying down the road at Fancy G's other property, the Laurel Canyon Inn. No way! Fancy G bought it and completely remodeled it for her own private getaway. - That's right. You know your stuff. - I'm literally her biggest fan. For real, I'm president of the Michigan Fancy G Fan Club, so... Okay, then. Well, welcome. I'm Mac, Fancy G's manager, friend, compadre, part-time therapist, and champion. Also, I'd like to think that I had a little something to do with Fancy G's amazing career. And you all have met Fancy G's executive assistant, Jenny. Hi again, everyone. If you need anything, you just let me know. Okay. Before you introduce yourself, there is someone who is dying to meet you. Follow me, ladies. - We're doing this. - Are we ready? What's up, girls? Oh, my gosh, she's so amazing. She's so gorgeous. She's so perfect. - You owe me for this. - I know. Okay. "I'm so honored to have all of you here. I don't want you to think of this as a contest, but rather an audition. Each and every one of you is fiercely talented. And just remember, if you don't make it to the final show, it only means it's not your time... yet. First, we'll get you settled, then, we'll have a set of star challenges. And after each challenge, one of you will go home. The final girl standing will open for me in my worldwide livestreamed concert event. This isn't about discovering a star. This is about discovering a triple threat. This talented person needs to not only have it all, this girl needs to be tough. Fame isn't always easy, and you have to be ready to face not only your fans but your critics." For real, having thin skin is not an option. - So do you guys really want this? - Yes. - Yes! - Seriously, this is not a joke. The pressure can be intense. You think I get a pass if I misstep? I don't. This is not just fun and games. This is a job. Yeah. I thought this was gonna be more, like, chill, you know? Like a vacation. This sounds like a lot of work. I don't think this is for me. Oh, okay. Wait. Is she for real? Okay. Well, you all know Fancy G. Why don't you all introduce yourselves to her? Heart. Nice shirt. Hey. You got this. Talk. Yeah. I'm Charlie. - What's your favorite Heart song? - "Crazy on You." The guitar solo in the opening blows my mind. Right? Nancy Wilson is the most underrated guitarist in rock history. I always say that. - This whole look is definitely working. - Thank you. I created and designed it. I make a lot of my own clothes. I'm Brit, and it's an honor to be here. You're Annie! I'm Annie! I mean, I think I'm Annie. Yeah. I'm definitely Annie. I'm from Ann Arbor. Annie from Ann Arbor. Michigan. Try saying it five times. Annie from Ann Arbor. - Annie from Ann Arbor. - Annie! You know my name. Fancy G knows my name! Annie, you gotta chill out. Can you breathe? Yeah, I'm breathing now. Okay. Just keep doing that. Welcome to the Laurel Canyon Inn. - Smells good. - Yeah. Isn't it just magical? Wow, you packed a lot. Oh, yeah, you know, a girl's gotta be prepared. Oh, my gosh. Built in 1964, at its height, this was a regular hangout for all the coolest and most influential musicians at the time. Our chaperones will be on-site full-time to keep you safe, and our staff is here to help with anything you need. Is there room service? Yes. We have award-winning chefs and a 24-hour room service menu available. So we can order, like, anything we want, any time? Yeah. And we have a fitness center. A double cheeseburger with bacon at 2 a.m.? - Lobster just because? - Ice cream at any time, for breakfast? I'll have to see about that. You'll be sharing bungalows, and your rooms have already been assigned. Brit? I love bungalows. - I mean, wow. - Okay. Yeah. - What are you doing? - I love you. Go home. We're all in Bungalow 4? Actually? Actually. - It's so amazing. - This is sick. This is so cool. I can't believe we're all here. We're in L.A. I know, right? All right, keep up the good work, ladies. - You got this. - I so don't. They need to realize it's not just about singing. You need to dance on-stage at 120 beats per minute for two hours. They're just briskly walking right now. How do you know they're walking? You haven't looked up from your phone. I did. They're briskly walking. They're gonna learn about getting in shape when they meet JJ Sparks. They're meeting with my choreographer? Who's paying for that? I'm not paying for that. Am I paying for that? So nervous in the challenges. If someone doesn't make it, it just means it's not their time. She was just being nice. No offense, but my mom says there's not room at the top for everyone. She's right. I didn't come here to play. I came here to win. This isn't summer camp. Well, 'night, y'all. - It's been a long day. - Yeah. I'm gonna get to bed. Good night. Sleep tight! Okay, so am I, like, the only one that is completely intimidated by everyone and everything here? Thank you, yes. I'm totally freaked out. - Same. - Same. How long have you been playing? Oh, jeez, since forever. I never had lessons though. My dad just showed me, and I kind of picked it up. My parents put me in piano lessons when I was 5, but honestly, I've always loved singing more than anything. I've always loved doing everything. Singing, dancing, guitar, piano. - You're probably good at all of it. - Right. Sure, but... My hair is, like, gonna get in the fire. So today is about showing off your dance skills. But unfortunately, someone will have to go home. - Hello, ladies. - You didn't have to be here today. - He's my choreographer. - Okay. All right. JJ Sparks! Well, JJ, looks like you already have a fan. You choreographed all of Fancy G's videos and the Super Bowl halftime show. You're like the most amazing choreographer in the world. - I only hire the best. - What's your name? I'm Alex. All right, Alex, do you know all the dance moves to Fancy G's video "Louder"? Know it? My dance team won regional's doing it. Look at you. Okay, Miss Regionals, you ready to show off your moves? All right. Come on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. I don't wanna hear me. I hear me all the time. Let's take it old-school. Five, six, seven, eight. Come on, everybody! All right. Five, six... Five, six, seven, eight. Go! Hey, hey, hey! Annie? Are you okay? Oh, man, she got acquainted with that wall quite well. Yeah. Can you hear us? Hello? I really shouldn't be here. What are you talking about? I'm actually not a performer. I mean, I can do a really great impression of you. I'm covered in diamonds I get it. I get it. Yeah, but I'm a terrible dancer. I mean, I can't create music. And I'm your biggest fan. More than anything, I just really, really wanted to meet you. Well, that was bold of you to admit all of that. I like bold. As a matter of fact, I think I need someone bold to be the president of my international fan club. But I'm really sorry, it's just you don't have an international fan club. She does now. Are we gonna dance or what? Let's make a circle! - Yeah! - Come on! - Get in there. - No. Yes, you do. Get in there! Oh, my gosh. - I did not see that coming. - Me neither. Okay. Well, we had some killer moves in here today. I agree. And since some of us are not eligible, the winner of today's challenge is... Is Alex. Good job! Here. Hi. - It's me. - Mom. Mom, you... What are you...? You can't be here. You're gonna get us both in trouble. Tell me how today went, honey. Did you wow them? - Are we on the path to victory? - Are you okay? I'm just grabbing a towel. - Thank you, sir. - No problem. - Good night. - 'Night. Sorry. Did I wake you up? - No, I couldn't sleep. - I can't either. I was just thinking. I mean, I didn't even send in my own audition. - My 9-year-old student did. - Really? But now that I'm here, I really wanna stay. Today was the most amazing day of my life. Yeah. I don't wanna go either. Not to get all, like, cheesy, but I feel like we've all known each other forever. - Same. - Same. I'm sort of a loner back at home. I think everyone thinks I'm the weird record-store girl. Better than the mathlete super-nerd. Whenever anyone at school has any kind of problem with math or science, they're always like, "Ask Maya." And I'm like, "Guys, there's more to me than equations, people." And you are probably the most popular girl at your school. - Probably. - Stop. I mean maybe, but nobody really knows me. The real me, you know? Totally. You know, for the first time in my life, I actually feel like I belong. - Well, let's make sure none of us go home. - But only one of us can win. Let's make sure we're the last three standing. Are you guys hungry? - Yes, kind of. - Yeah. Hungry. Hey. They did say we can order anything we want, 24 hours a day. True. - Oh, I'm so excited. I can't wait. - I know. Me too. Hi, this is Charlie from Bungalow 4. Maybe midnight pizza wasn't such a good idea. Better than Daniella's 2 a.m. sushi dinner. And two root beer floats. Good morning, ladies. Today we have another amazing guest. Megahit songwriter, Calvin Maxine! What's up? It's an honor to meet all of you. It's an honor to write songs for this queen. Today we have a songwriting challenge, but first Calvin is gonna drop some tips to help you. Then, you'll have the afternoon to work on your own original song. And when you're all done, Calvin will read your songs, and he will decide who the winner is. Actually, Fancy G will be reading, and she will decide who the winner is. I will? I will. All right, first thing's first. On your feet. Okay. - I know what you're doing. - What? I'm not doing anything. I want you to take an oath with me. So take your right hand and put it on your heart. I will dig deep. I will have soul. I will be bold. I will dig deep. I will have soul. And I will be bold. - Wait. Can I add something? - Of course. A song has the power to change the world. One of the most important things you can be is honest. In your words, your actions, and your music. A song... - Power... - A song that... Stop, wait. How about... I will always be truthful. I will always be truthful. Perfect. All right. Let's do this. I first just wanna start by running through some of the songwriting basics. Intros, verses, pre-choruses, choruses, refrains, turnarounds, hooks, outs. Do you have any questions? - Yeah. - This is for Fancy G. Why did you stop writing your own songs? Fancy G's always very involved in the songwriting process. We work closely together. I'm sorry, I didn't mean... I just mean, didn't you write all the songs for Triple Crown? Yeah. I did. I can't believe you know about Triple Crown. Yeah. My favorite song is "Atlas." - She was in a band? - Yeah. Fancy G is so incredibly busy, she doesn't have time to write. And besides, why write when you have the best in the business to do it for her? But isn't Fancy G the best in the business? I appreciate that. But how about we get back to Calvin and your songs? Calvin? Yeah. Why don't we start by finding the hook? Shall we? How did you...? Here's a song. Mom, you can't be serious. The songwriter's a pro. And I told her all about you, so the song is influenced by you. Just put it in your notebook. Eye on the prize. Eye on the prize. You okay? My song. I don't even know where to start. I mean, I can write code for a computer program, and give me any math problem, and I'm all over it. But feelings and all that, I just... Well, how are you feeling right now? Panicked. How are you feeling right now about being here? - I feel... - Hold up. Don't say anything. Just write it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can't believe Fancy G was in a band. Same. Yeah. I actually have a copy of their one and only record. - Wait, really? - No way. Yeah, here. Vinyl! Cool! This is sick. - You got a record player in there too? - I wish. - How'd you get it? - I was actually raised in a record store. I think they only pressed a few thousand. You know, I was hoping maybe Fancy G would sign it, but did you see her face when I brought up Triple Crown? - Yeah, I did see that. - I really hope she doesn't hate me now. She has to be impressed. None of us knew about Triple Crown. Well, your help with my song saved me. It was like magic, you know. It just poured out. I feel like I had some good ideas, but nothing really came together. Me too. I've never even tried to write a whole song. You know how he was talking about hooks? I have 50 hooks but no verses. All I have are verses and no hooks. - Maybe we can write something together. - Totally. - I'll start out with the beat. - Okay. I'm gonna write some words down. - That's cool. - That's really cool. I like that, yeah. So what if it went like...? Better together Down for whatever That's pretty, yeah, yeah. Wait. - Do it again. I'll add something. - Okay. - Better together - Down for whatever This is where we're meant to be - Yes! Yes, yes, yes! - We can all sing that line. - Okay, okay. - Yeah, yeah. You sing the first one. You sing the second. We all sing the third. - Okay. - Okay. Better together Down for whatever This is where we're meant to be - So good! - So good! Wow, how did we do that? Yes! I was really impressed by all of your songs. For real, I was actually in shock. But unfortunately, one of you is going home. I'm sorry, Daniella. It's okay. I get it. Technically your song was structured well. But it was safe. Something special was missing. It was kind of like you didn't put enough of you in there. But I would love for you to stay one more night and have some fun. - Right, Jen? - Of course. Hey. Don't stop working, Daniella. As I was saying, lots of great lyrics. But there was one song in particular that really spoke to my heart. It felt like it was written by a pro. And it really, really inspired me. Great songs are honest. And this song, I found incredibly honest. Maya. Wait, for real? Yes, for real. You put so much of yourself out there and were so brave. You wanna get up and sing a little bit? Okay. But can Charlie and Alex join too? I mean, we sort of... - This is not a group project. - Oh, I know. - It's just that last night... - Fancy G is right. We're happy you're bonding, but this is an audition for one spot. Okay. All right. Drop in the ocean Heart was hopin' One day I'd find home Under streetlights What would it be like To have my name be known? My faith was blind Followed the signs Took every wrong turn But some kind of fate lit up my way And showed what I deserve Used to dance in darkness Now I'm singing in the sun Life was feeling heartless But I still believed in love Now I'm setting fire to all that I knew All that was broken gave me a breakthrough Now I can feel it in my soul so strong I'm where I belong Where I can be brave Ride a new wave Crash and stand up tall Where I can do it like that And they still got my back When I fall, they can run And pick me up ASAP When you got real friends No, you don't gotta ask Know that Big facts My faith was blind Followed the signs Took every wrong turn But some kind of fate lit up my way And showed what I deserve Used to dance in darkness Now I'm singing in the sun Life was feeling heartless But I still believed in love Now I'm setting fire to all that I knew All that was broken gave me a breakthrough Now I can feel it in my soul so strong I'm where I belong That's a song. Girl, you definitely belong here. I have all the feels. I'm sorry. So the next challenge is all about social media. We're gonna go on a field trip, and you'll have the afternoon to take selfies while hashtagging "Fancy G." Let's go. Hey. I really, really love your song. Thank you. Are you coming with us? Oh, no. If I go, it'll turn into a whole thing. A whole thing? So there's this pack of paparazzi that follow me, and they make going out very difficult. - Is it hard? - What? Fame. I mean, I know it's amazing and everything, but do you ever get tired of it? I've been doing this since I was your age, and I'm super blessed. But I think about the little things that I missed out on. You know, like prom, homecoming. Don't even get me started on dating. Those don't seem like little things to me. I guess not. - Maya, that song you wrote was incredible. - For real. Thanks, but I wish we could have performed that song we wrote too. Legit, guys, the three of us together are a force. I wonder why she's so against groups. Probably Triple Crown. I mean, she looked like a ghost when I brought it up. That's gotta be it. I wonder what happened. Wait, guys, look. Maybe they'll have a record player. Cool. Let's go. This place is... Bonjour! Je m'appelle Henri. May I help you? Yes. Hi. We were wondering if you may have a vinyl record player. Bien sûr, let me call my grandson. He knows all about the new technology. Jack! - Jack! - Yeah, Pops? Hey. These lovely ladies are looking for a record player. - Oh, cool. - Yeah. Totally. I'm Alex. Jack. Yeah, I think we have a portable one in the back. I'll go check. That would be really cool of you. Easy, tiger. This place has been in my family since it opened in 1924. We have treasures from all over the world. - Take a look around. - Okay. Guys, look. "Les Filles de Miel." The Honey Girls. French immersion school since pre-K. They're so beautiful. Seems appropriate. "Teegan." Cool. So cool. - "Viv." - "Risa?" Maybe Teegan, Risa, and Viv were friends, or maybe they were a group. Yeah. How do I look? Seriously, you look c'est magnifique, Risa. You too, Viv. I knew we had a portable record player. Bravo! - Les Filles de Miel, the Honey Girls. - Were they a group? Oui, in the 1920s. They were the most sought after singers in all of Paris. Legend was no one knew their true identity. Actually? When you wear these masks, you can be whoever you want to be. - Would you mind taking a video? - Sure. They called me crazy to believe in magic But deep inside my fireworks were flashing I always knew That something good would happen And I know you've been feeling it too We saw what they couldn't While I was looking for you You were looking for me Better together, down for whatever This is where we're meant to be All our lives we dream of something That would feel like this Now it's bigger Better than we could imagine it No more wishing, nothing's missing No, we don't need to search anymore Feels like we have finally found What we've been looking for Found what we've been looking What we've been looking We've been looking for Found what we've been looking What we've been looking We've been looking for It's the beginning Of the rest of our lives Don't have a ceiling No, there ain't no skies This is what happens When your hopes stay high All the beautiful stars finding you We saw what they couldn't While I was looking for you You were looking for me Better together, down for whatever This is where we're meant to be All our lives We dream of something That would feel like this That would feel like this Now it's bigger Better than we could imagine it No more wishing, nothing's missing No, we don't need to search anymore Feels like we have finally found What we've been looking for Found what we've been looking What we've been looking We've been looking for Found what we've been looking What we've been looking We've been looking for - Fantastic. - You guys are incredible. - Here you go. - Thanks. You are the Honey Girls. How much for these? No, no, no. They are priceless. I cannot charge for what is destined to be yours. Oh, sir, we couldn't take these. But it already belongs to you. S'il vous plait. Let us at least buy the record player. That sounds fair. Allez! I really hope I see you again. You definitely will. Bye, Jack. - That was amazing! - You think? - We could actually be Les Filles de Miel. - Totally. - The Honey Girls. - Yeah. That's awesome, but what about Fancy G and the contest? Well, I don't know. I mean, can't we just do both? - I'm in. - Same. Good news. The Honey Girl handle hasn't been taken. What are you doing? I just created our Honey Girls account and uploaded our first video. - Wow, you're quick. - Yeah. Is she okay? She looks sort of lost or something. - Brit! - Hey, Brit. Hey. - What's going on? - What are you doing? Just what everyone else is. Trying to find something to post. What did you get? Oh, nothing. Just some souvenirs. - Wanna hang with us? - Really? Yeah. Okay. Come on. Guys, look at Tate. Yeah. Ready? "Fancy G" on three. One, two, three. Fancy G! So... I've been checking out your photos, and while I was looking, I found an example of a post full of originality. Yeah, so I'm not into groups, but I love their style. They remind me of this party I went to during Fashion Week at Versailles. And they tagged me in the post. What do you think, Jen? I cannot believe you did that. - I think they're super original. - What if she finds out? - Who are they? - The Honey Girls. They only have one post up, but it's already going super viral. Yeah. They're very talented. But back to us. So I've been looking at your photos, and they're really cool too. Now this is the one I thought said a lot. Social media should be more about creating a community than self-promotion. Tate, I love that you chose to post this photo of all of you guys. Congrats. Yeah. It seems like we're missing something from Hannah. I couldn't think of anything, so I just gave up. You know, I know it's really hard to put yourselves out there. I get it. Look, we can't get anywhere in life if we don't at least try. Luck is simply when opportunity meets preparation. You weren't prepared today, but like I said, it just wasn't your time. But let's have some fun tonight, okay? Okay. Thanks, Fancy G. Thank you, guys. See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. - So hungry. - Let's get some snacks. I can't believe you tagged Fancy G. Are you crazy? If she finds out it's us, - we're all getting kicked out. - Well, it worked. Nobody recognized Teegan, Risa or Viv. Oh, my gosh, dude. That was crazy. We're really doing this. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Thank you. - That looks good. You'll get them next time. What are you doing? Maybe if we can build up the Honey Girls big enough, Fancy G won't care. - She's already a fan, right? - True. - The record. I almost forgot. - Oh, yeah. Go get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - How's it going over here? - Good. Totally good. Got it. What's that? Well... Charlie has a Triple Crown record. Really? No way. Should I turn it off? No, no. Whoa, can I see that? - I can't believe she was in a band. - So cool, right? I actually love her even more now. - Same. - Same. You have the coolest job in the world. Most days I do. I love Fancy G. She's the best, but someday I wanna be a manager just like Mac and have my own company. You'd be an amazing manager. - Agreed. - Agreed. What happened to Triple Crown? It's really sad. Her band broke her heart. They were your age when they started performing together. One day the band just walked out on Fancy G. They were best friends and then they weren't. - Why? Why did they leave her? - She never knew. They just said that they were moving on. So she signed with Mac, became Fancy G, and just never looked back. So that's why she doesn't like groups. She always insists that the only person you could count on is yourself. Hey. Wait. I don't mean to scare you guys. It's just that being a star is not all glamour. It's a lot of work and a lot of sacrifice. It's getting late. See you girls tomorrow. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - I can't believe they bailed on her. - I know. I don't know, y'all. I love the Honey Girls. I know we came here for ourselves, but I feel like I came here to meet you, and for us to be a group. - Same. - Same. I've never really had friends that get my music or get me. The song I wrote wasn't just about the contest. It was about us. This is where we all belong. Together. Welcome, ladies. This is my stylist and one of the hottest designers in the fashion world. Marline Grayson! Welcome, everybody. Today we want to get a sense of your own personal style. While I do design the dresses and looks for Fancy G's videos, a great designer draws inspiration from her client. It's not about me reinventing Fancy G, but rather highlighting who she is. Today, that's your challenge. Let's highlight your own style. Work on your brand. Think about who you are and what you wanna represent. Exactly. Fancy G and I don't believe in makeovers. We believe in takeovers. Take over and own who you are. Now, own it. Or you will be going home. Roll out the racks. Yes, Charlie, this look, it's... This is perfect. But this is what I wore here. This color is going to look beautiful on you. Come on! I can see that you're in the fashion zone. It is such an honor. Your 2018 collection at Paris Fashion Week was, like, everything. That dress with the drop back. You know that Fancy G wore that to the Grammys? Yeah, she did. I'll let you get back to the zone. Can't wait to see the final product. - This material is very impressive. - Okay. Brit, your design skills are legit. You are the winner of today's challenge. Congratulations. So what's this whole look about? I don't know. - Are you in pain? - So much pain. You can take your heels off now. I know it's hard to see right now, but you want your style to, like, highlight the best parts of you so that you feel amazing. That whole skater look that you came in with, it was great. Maybe you should explore that more. I'm sorry, Lexi. You're going home. It's okay. Bye, guys. - Bye, Lexi. - See you. I wonder what they were like. Viv, Teegan and Risa. - You think they were anything like us? - Maybe they were. Well, you heard what Henri said. Nobody knew their identities either. That's what makes the Honey Girls so cool. We can still be ourselves. And we don't have to give everything up like Fancy G said. - We can have normal lives too. - But we're down to five girls tomorrow. What if one of us goes home? I feel like we were destined to be the Honey Girls. But you heard what Fancy G said. - We're not allowed to be the Honey Girls. - Yet. If we can make it to the final three, maybe we can convince her. We all just need to hang on for one more day. And who are you texting? Jack from the store. I know you've all dreamed about what your first album cover might look like. Well, here's your shot. I want you to show off your own style, tell your story, and do it in one photo. Using the props, costumes, and a little graphic design, you'll have about two hours to do your thing. - Are you okay? - I just... I feel so weird. I wish I had my Honey Girls mask. Cameras freak me out. What's your favorite thing to do in the world? This is so cool, Charlie. It's perfect. I think we have our winner. I feel like I got to know most of you a lot better. But, Tate, your cover didn't really tell me anything about you. In fact, it reminds me a lot of, well, me. Yeah. Seemed like a much better idea at the time. You don't have to say it. I know I lost. There are no losers here. It's just not your time. But I do appreciate the shout-out though. Okay, ladies, get some rest. Tomorrow we are down to four. I love that melody. What is that? Something new. Something I've been working on. - You've been writing? - Yeah. In fact, I haven't felt this inspired in years. Hey, Jen. Thanks. - She's so going to win. - Yeah. You literally just won the album contest. But you've seen her. She's like a pro. So pro. What if one of us gets tossed tomorrow? I say tomorrow, we come clean. Either way. I mean, if Brit wins it just means one of us is going home - and then we just tell Fancy the truth. - Yeah. Totally. I don't know. I don't think we should decide right now. We're so close to the end and they could throw all of us out at the same time. Can we just see how things go tomorrow? And no matter what we decide, we'll do it together. All or nothing? All or nothing. Better together, on three. - You're such a jock. - Right. One, two, three. Better together! Mom, I really love fashion and I'm good at it. This is your big break. Hey, Brit? Hey, Brit. You want to hang out with us? No. They're the competition. We're gonna order room service and hang out. - Wanna come? - Why? Why not? Okay. Maybe. Actually, maybe you should go. See if you can get some dirt on them. Keep your enemies close. Mom, I don't... I don't know. Wow, this is really Fancy G? So have you always been into fashion design? Yeah. Ever since I can remember. - Well, you're really good at it. - Thanks. - Can you pass me the Sun Chips? - Yeah. Well, I'm glad nobody saw that, because I have pizza all over my shirt. It's okay. You can clean it off in the bathroom. - Yeah, I'm gonna go do that. - In there. Want some? I'll be right back. Honey Girls. Did it come out? Oh, yeah. You know, it's late and we have a challenge in the morning, so... Okay. Okay. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Bye. I really like these. I can't believe I'm actually writing again. Dude, I'm just happy you're inspired. I told you this contest was fire. I mean, a good idea. And then there were four. Wait, where...? Where's the fourth? Sorry. Sorry. So today is the singing challenge. Wait. There's something that I need to say. - What's going on? - Well... I think there's something that you should all know. You see, I think it's important to be honest. - Yes. It's really important to be honest. - Yeah. I mean, you wouldn't want someone here who wants something different than what you'd want. Right? Right. We had to take that oath to be truthful. What is it, Brit? It's not cool to lie about who you are. Music isn't my passion and I wanna be a fashion designer! No! No! - Mom? - "Mom"? - "Mom"? - No! - No! No. - Mom, stop. Mom, I'm sorry, but... I wanna be a fashion designer. But... - we worked so hard. - You. You worked so hard. Hold up. You're her mom? And you've been here the whole time? Oh, my gosh. You're like the next-level helicopter mom. This was your shot at a bigger life. Can't you just accept who I am and support my dreams? Not your dreams for me? But I thought this was your dream. I'm trying to tell you, it's... It's not. Your daughter is an awesome designer. As a matter of fact, Marline Grayson told me that she wants you to help design something for me to wear in my show. Brit. - That's amazing. - Really? I am proud of you no matter what. I am so sorry I've been so crazy. Yeah, you're soaking wet. I'm gonna be who I wanna be. You should too. You know? Come here, Mama. I love you. I love you. - We have to tell her. - Tell me what? All or nothing. Okay. Please understand, we didn't plan on this happening. - What's going on? - We just feel like we're better together. The three of us. Yeah. One night we started singing together and it just happened. It wasn't intentional. It was just like destiny for us to meet. - So you're saying you wanna be a group? - We are a group. We're the Honey Girls. - You're the Honey Girls? - Is that okay? Is that okay? This is amazing, are you kidding me? This is so much better than I could've imagined. This is brilliant. This... This is huge. Yes. It's genius! What are you talking about? This is not genius! We're looking for a new solo artist, not a group. But, Fancy, I've been tracking them. The Honey Girls are blowing up. They're huge. And we discovered them. We can sign them to our company. You can mentor them and produce them. We can put them on our worldwide tour. - Just think of the ticket sales. - No, Mac! I don't care about any of that. I didn't sign up for this. You didn't sign us up for this. The Honey Girls are a group. This is not cool. - It's not cool at all. - Well, wait a second. - Maybe we could work something out. - There's nothing to work out. - Come on, be reasonable. - You know how I feel. You know how I feel about groups. I care too much about these girls for that. But this is different. You were clearly the star of Triple Crown. Everybody knew it. Even your own bandmates agreed. What do you mean, they agreed? You broke us up? No. Fancy, listen. The record label only wanted you. And Emily and Kelsey, they didn't wanna hold you back. All these years, I thought my best friends just left me. Do you have any idea what that did to me? I'm sorry. I thought you knew. The contest is over. I'm sorry. The concert is over. We are over! Fancy G? You really did inspire us. Everything's done. The sponsors, the label. Well, you're good at breaking things up. So you deal with it! Fancy. I'm so sorry. We didn't mean to cause all this. No, it's not your fault. You should probably call your parents. I don't see how this could work. I mean, we live so far away from each other. We could FaceTime or Zoom. Or we could each sing our part and I can cut it all together. - There's gotta be a way. - The Honey Girls are done. It's over. Hi, Fancy G. We're on our way to the airport right now. Change of plans. - Wait, what? What's going on? - Where are they taking us? - Where are we going? - I don't know. Thank you guys for coming back. You see, the thing about being an artist is we get very, very emotional sometimes. Losing Triple Crown really broke my heart. And I don't want that for you guys. I would love for the Honey Girls to open for me. If, of course, you're still interested. - Yes, of course! - Yes, yes, yes! Okay. One thing though. I think you should keep your masks for as long as you can. - Okay. - Enjoy the privacy. Enjoy it just being about the music. We need to get over to the venue for rehearsal. Okay. Hey, you okay? Yeah. You know the real reason I bought this place? Triple Crown's first and last gigs were here. We were so young. You know, you did all of this. You discovered these girls. I'm really proud of you, Jen. Hey, Fancy. Kels, Em, is that really you? It's really us. Hi, Gabby. Gabby? Oh, my gosh. What are you guys doing here? Is that Triple Crown? I asked them to come. So I could apologize to all of you. What you had together was so very special. And I'm really sorry. I was so focused on making you a star that I forgot about making you happy. I guess I just... I guess I just lost my way. I think somewhere I lost my way too. - I missed you guys so much. - Us too. You know, the Honey Girls are gonna need a manager to navigate these crazy waters. You know, to negotiate contracts with record labels and producers. Contracts? Dude, you have ten labels wanting record deals. - What? - Really? He's right. You're gonna need someone you trust and who saw something in you from the very beginning. I'd love to be the person that manages the Honey Girls. - Really? That's amazing! - So amazing! Oh, yeah, I was... I was probably going to suggest you. It's your time. What are you doing? - Oh, my gosh! I look so cool! - I know. Okay. You guys wanna finish warming up? Hello? - Brit! - Oh, my gosh! Hi! - Oh, my gosh. - You guys look so pretty. - I love your outfit. - Thank you. I designed it myself. Of course you did. I actually am here because I have something for all of you. Fancy G asked me for a favor. Your masks are so beautiful, but they're also 100 years old. True. Very, very delicate. And they've gotten you this far, but it's definitely time to take you to the next level. I used your original masks as inspiration. I hope that you like them. - These are sick. - Oh, my gosh. - You made these? - You really like them? - You made this! - They are beautiful. Okay. Give me a hug. - They're so cool. - Oh, my gosh. - Thank you. - Okay, good luck. We'll see you after. - Bye, girls. - Bye. - Thank you. - Love you guys. Welcome to the Like a Diamond world event. Let's kick it off with a greeting from the one and only, Fancy G! Over the past few weeks, we've held an audition. And the funny thing is that in searching for the next Fancy G, I actually found myself again. All of these girls inspired me and awakened a part of me that I haven't connected to in years. We realized that they each have their own unique talent, and that's what makes them so special. So there is no one winner of the contest. Tonight, I'd like to introduce a new group that has taught me two very important things: Always be who you wanna be, and we are definitely better together. Please welcome to the stage for the first time, the Honey Girls! Can you feel it? It's waiting for us up ahead Can you see it? It's time to fly away Jump off the edge But dreams don't come easy You gotta believe it Held on till we found a way Swam the through the deep end Changed with the seasons I know we've earned our place, yeah We followed the stars Now there's no doubt I'm ready You're ready Nobody can break us, tear us down We're ready To take it up higher Higher, higher Into the clouds We're ready Ain't no looking down 'Cause forever together Look at us now We're ready We're ready Can you see it? We elevated to a higher ground Like... Can you hear it? That's our destiny calling out But dreams don't come easy You gotta believe it Held on till we found a way Swam through the deep end Changed with the seasons I know we've earned our place We followed the stars Now there's no doubt I'm ready, you're ready Nobody can break us, tear us down We're ready to take it up higher Higher, higher Into the clouds We're ready Ain't no looking down 'Cause forever together Look at us now We're ready We're ready We're ready We're ready We're ready We're ready - I'm so excited. - Me too.
