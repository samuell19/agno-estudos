The documents are here itself. I don't have much money. Still it's a small favour. You know about my situation | asked only for some time to repay Is he your son? -Yes Come Give me that cash Here it is. - No sir If your son beats my son in the game, I will write offthe money you owe me You go away Like that How is it possible? This is between the kids What? It's not about the game, sister Pawn 13 to 29 Knight 2to 19 This game is not to compete like this Lord Vadakkumnatha...

Now dare you touch him I don't want the money back What did I do? They were angry about that Can I stop that Mathai? Anyone can? Stop sitting at the temple premises in the name of chess I'm coming No Vasuetta, is there any issue? - Nothing What is the matter? See your brother's photo This is like my brother See brother's photo in the newspaper Now everyone has a camera You are my smart kid A bee is waiting for them... We live here Flowing like a river When we swim in it we fly along as one dreams blossom in the shades that love gifts the kisses of raindrops rises sky high You taught him to play chess? You taught him to play chess? ...Chess boards, carrom boards too lcould not run behind him always When they come after selling peanuts the elders will be there playing chess in the ground His blindfolded game is brilliant When our kids refuse to eat He gets bored and he goes out I tried to find new tricks while playing Shall we go for a round? Don't spoil our reputation giving admission to the kids of some groundnut vendors fFine. But why do you insist on having this kid? Why can't you just go around and find some really talented players among them? There are many from such schools who have done wonders in this world Just a consideration. Will plan everything else later Since the management considered this as a special case, the fees has been avoided All the best, Subramanian Can I get an admission for my daughter too, with my son? Can't you let him study here this year? I didn't say you should lose the opportunity. The number of students are becoming less in school. That's why Sit there I don't want that new school. Let me be in my school That's good. You need not go. It won't be fun there You knowwhat's her problem? She is jealous It's a fortune to get an admission there Don't worry, son Mom. - Let me see You will have an entirely different atmosphere here from your earlier school I will learn to play chess See your friends are there What can I do nouf? Then they will throwyou out if you lose in chess This is my first chance It's that boy who won the chess match? Ambu... what happened? Tell now Don't think you are in a new classroom amidst so many students You continue your battle here The sun is there as your eyes Come forward bravely... The nature is with you as a shade not leaving you alone like a breeze, rain, fire of knowledge To win, rig ht? Daddy was planning to come to your home Subramanian, what did the Grand Master say? That he will teach the game? let's go It will affect the reputation and dignity ofthis prestigious institution I understood all that you said, sir Don't stand in front of the school gate with your hand cart Nowadays students are ashamed when parents come to school with a grey hair I had told you not to send me to that school I will take care of it all Subru, take care of your mother. I have never left her alone after she fell ill That's alright. We have to look at his future too Mom, everyone at school is going fortuitions. Shall I go as well? What are you doing? -What should I do? She never let that boy study I didn't mean that (chattering going on at the ground) It is when we see this kind of stupid moves that we realise Subru's value lfl call him he will come to play. Still I will never do that As grandpa wasn't well, the cart was left in the round ltold you I will go Let him sit there Vanajan, there is a letter foryou Who is it for? Father... I've been selling with my handcart here for so long Why? I can't do this? Do l have to say that too? Notjust him, I know howto throw all of you out. Don't make me do it Giri, don't get involved in this. You go now. -I will. You do this when they are down? You want to see who I am? Every time you win some of us are losing here Small squares joins a bigger one Sixteen takes on another sixteen in this battle The rook runs straight Each move is to be made with proper plans There are no bloodsheds 0rthe coins won't move on its own Each coin moves on its turn, slowly Subru... Many who were written off by the world have been successful later You can win if you decide... you should win Muneeb, however he plays in the 64 squares, he won't win even a single game in Thrissur He defeated me and my son. I will never spare him He is such a wonderful player. Born to be a Grandmaster I don't train anyone looking at their social status or financial background Please keep her here if she comes. What is the matter? - Nothing Where has she gone then? If so then why did they take to the hospital? Are you that tense? There is nothing to worry Can you walk? Dad, isn't MODIFICATION written wrongly here? It should be I and not E Then tell me the spelling ofABSOLUTE What should I call you? -Ambu Bryan is a SPELLING BEE trainer We don't have the skill to win in competitions Don't take it in a bad way. He is saying out of sadness guides, dictionary and so on She became ill with that I used to refer dictionary to know about the medicines and diseases May be because she saw and heard about it... she started liking dictionary all along Please don't say No Letters are wings to seek knowledge It's the fire that will neverfade once you get it will get life as years pass by without ever fading out mightierthan a sword in your hands Coincidentally, Ambu's first com petition is happening at the Imperial International School where he is studying You have to get it signed by the headmaster of the school where Ambu is studying Since you found it out, you kept her outside the class for a whole day Nowthere is a plot near Sobha city GENERATION SYMPATHY You are not going to watch Spelling Bee? I'm not well. I'm not going today You know whom you have defeated? When I understood their social background and living conditions... So we have decided to give a special prize for this child If her parents are fine... This is my responsibility, duty and an honour We would like to know who is behind this talent Sir, please come to the stage The whole credit for Ambily's performance should go to just one person It's him...Her father... Mr. Vanajan I don't have such knowledge Nothing serious... Just as a game Pneumonoultramicros co-picsilicovoIcanoconiosis Please... We don't bring up kids thinking they should reach great heights They just grow up as they wish They actually changed our lives The long awaited full moon has bloomed For our little kids whom we bring up with affection Inspite ofthe tears in life the rainbow will never fade What else is there in earth more noble than providing food? Isn't it true that love multiplies when shared?
