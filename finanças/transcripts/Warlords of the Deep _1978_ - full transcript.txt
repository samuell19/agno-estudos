Warlords of Atlantis - Ready, Sandy? - Okay sir Kolinson. You want to play and you? No thanks, will I store the my strength to dive. And to say years Gregory My name is Charles. Are you sure we're on the right spot ? We will not do fast route? The equipment is approved by the royal family. It is high existing group. Even if you do not have heard. I can not be a genius in all Charles. Sure, like you're not sure about that. If I'm sure? I made it. I will do the job, I am where would you drive. Look you that has to do with science, will go our under me... Okay? Sounds good. I am the only one who can count... Charlie... Now pass Bermuda sir. We will be the destination tomorrow afternoon. Exquisite Daniels. Look not glad about it trip. What me say then Captain. I'm trying to give you a tip. It was good to hear. I hear very well. Have a paranoid logic. Look lost many ships these waters. I do not want Texas Rose is and another. Very good your observation occurred. This is where all I want to say. Sir. Captain Daniels? Is my father still in his cabin? Yes there is. And not heard yet. Continue warn you about them dangers in these waters. - That I need! - This is for the teacher. We'll make another. The worth. Hey, I did not say to take it down it yet. Standard control captain. Typical control. I do not want anything to go wrong when us download the seabed. To send this tin below what sea? How do you breathe? Simple give me your coffee. Say this cup of coffee is turned upside down. Pour this cup of water and the air is sealed inside. Correctly; Yes, but with the bottom open, this is crazy. Crazy but it works. Believe me. When that little has backup systems we would be down. And also I am not a hero. I think Daniel has a point. There is something strange in these seas. I have given the best knowledge where possible. You get them more high degrees in the best universities of Europe,... ... And believe that crap prejudices? Father, at times we disappearances, destruction, where man can not explain... This is done in all the oceans of the world, son. You are not on the side of Daniel hope? Lord Kolinson? I have traveled around the world, from Hong Kong to the Barbary Coast,... ... I carry loads where thee tremble hair. - But this is stupidity... - Crazy? Crazy. Thank Santi. Thank you! Do not told to anyone. Neither in Gregory. You know I do not know if I should be happy about this... Nor I do not know. Besides the know all your life as I do not know if we will ever done it without his help. This is the point. If telling him the whole truth would leave us. He would turn back to California. You are right, Americans are skeptical and we can not imperiled. This business is the project of a lifetime, it is revolution, to meet humankind's past. Yes, he will be concerned about the dive tomorrow. Prepare the launch sir grog. - To embark. - Yes sir. Jaco, give the owners a help. After you Charlie. Get. - Charlie sat. - Thanks Gregory. - And I tell thee that they have more money than brains. - I agree. Thinking how much cost them all? - Is dreamy thing, well made. - Yes! Gorgeous! - I think it's madness. All set sir grog? Yes sir. We expect you to tell us. I talk to them first. Well gentlemen, the experiment begins. All they checked and double checked sir. Counting on you Gregory. Very well, Professor, if you want something we will talk to a contact number. Farewell Gregory, son... Father? Too bad you can not come with us. You nervousness Charlie? No! Gregory, I'm sure we both will bring confidence for the work of my father. So why you sweat? You're right is unhappiness here. Richtis sea sir grog. - Gently. - Gently. Start the professor pumps. Start the pumps sir grog. They came forward. You are able to Gregory. Start diving. Lower sir grog... Here we do not soak your feet. Good luck. Hey, do more slowly. Not so fast. Do not download them very quickly! It is a matter of air pressure adjustment. Do you understand Gregory's fantastic! I'm glad you like. What a view! This depth is good Professor? Download us and another 10 meters. And see the view from nearby. Download and another ten meters. Let us not go another deeper. Approaching the Charlie limit. Not go deeper, professor cut speed. Okay Gregory, then a state. Other 5 phantom sir grog. What was that? It's amazing. A live prehistoric creature. In this age... If you can record it! Do not enter in it will cause us trouble. Yes it is a Antiope Vathriolopous. Do not do it to scare. I would not call for tea, Charlie. Come time to leave. Yes father? It's a platypus. He took my pen. Are you all right? Wants more. What are you doing? Do what I tell you, pull this lever. Pull it! Not now, wait. Now! Again! It was like the devil, right? Father was a Vathriolopous Antiope, a beautiful specimen. I hope you left forever. Least 6m long. He was right. His father was right. Your father was right about what thing Charlie? Is not this where you think Gregory. I'm not what you think? One thing is certain that there is fountain there. Professor climb more slowly. Not so fast. Late. Fixed now. This is stop. We can move Charles? Must! Okay I'll try. Nice catch Charlie. You have idea of what is it made of? An unusual and rare find. Beautiful, so should I consult my books. Look at it! Gold directly from the Eldorado... E grog may eventually these guys might not be as dumb as we thought. Certainly will not got there in such trouble just to see the fish? No one told me that I was hunting treasure? There is treasure to find someone such a finding, it is the dream of every archaeologist. It has been built before the time of Christ. The boat crew knows what this thing is built. Gold! I believe that tell them. It is a symbol a monument. Okay not to blame if you prepare anything? The discipline of the crew are your responsibility. Not if this infernal statue is on my ship. Captain Danilo, you govern this ship, but I'm the one who runs this business. I say how this statue is a scientific and historical significance finding. Look will not convince them with simple and funny words. Do what I tell you, give a bonus turn around back to the port. For all our sakes! What do there? For the name of God, the emotion will blame I think. - Do not be so impatient! - Impatient? I think your old man forgot us. - To pull this off? - It is five against three of us. Keep. That's better. Why do not they answer? Tell me; Gregory, stop chatter and look! Look it! I have to warn them. It is time to get rid of them. - Please professor listened. - Santi my boy... - Charlie close this valve! - She; - Yes. By listening? No benefit. Listen must be excised from the ship because of this creature. What the hell is happening up there. What sights? What are you doing here? Aaach. Ahh. LLDCs. Aaaach! Do not worry, Charlie, we have backup systems Remember, safety first. You see this button when I say pull him. Look turning back! She took the crew! Daniels! Watch Give me your hand! Pull! How long will last! Climb! The officers say they descend! Okay to look after you, Charlie. - You know swimming? - No. What? Charlie? Charlie you okay? We must be entered in the cave checked twice! Daniels? The only thing I remember is this monster to attack the ship. Save your powers. - You did. - How dry is 200 miles? - What is this place? - I have no idea. - Charlie? - Almighty. Look there are others. As if returning from death. - Is the coast. - But it is not all... - The Santi? The professor; My Holy Where are we? What happened to us and where is Texas Rose? The others; Come comrades. Relax kid. We're alive and that's enough for now. We were not the only ones. Hey... Captain? Do not say anything. Daniels may have no idea what we were planning. - Are you all right? - Yes, all you remember is this diavolopsaro who attacked us... - Beat us like a hurricane. - We would have no chance to survive, sir. This cut the cables of the submersible. We could not do anything. - What was the ship? - Still sailing when I immersed myself! Then Santi and the teacher is still on board. I wonder what it feels now. Mariners had said! Travellers, My name is Admir, Welcome. Thank you. I wonder, can you tell us where exactly are we? Washed up here, we definitely need help. My Holy help us! The guards are here to protect you. Will not hurt you. Go with them peacefully. -warlords Of atlantis- Where us go? In a safe place. Thank you, thank you. Why are you so polite? We are foreigners in their own country... Charlie the beach. Son forgive me... Together we found the source, was cursed... get rid of the death penalty... The statue sir? Dark gods built it... Warlords of Atlantis... Charles... watch out... A city... A town in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean? You will not find it on any map, - But you know the name... - Atlantis? Come Charlie is a legend. There is a sunken city, but a living culture. This is Troy's third city, we can rest there. The third city? And what were the first and the second? Lost in the waters of the endless depth. Forever! To rot? All things once off watching a lot of things, but not even we can not stop time. Eventually all 5 anapomeinontes cities and they will disappear. Seven cities in Atlantis, Plato was saying how there were nine cities? Plato not everything was right. - You know our own history? - What much of that pondering! How is this done? Now it is safe to proceed. Hurry! You and the teacher knew about this part time, why do not you tell me? I would say to Gregory, but I thought us not to give up... You have it done before... If I say the truth from the very beginning I would come? I did not want to come here, but next time try me again. I meant to tell you... We need to measure our chances now. I will ask this place Why proorizotane? Court was the third city of Troy. This monster who attacked us in the swamp, I have never seen anything like it on earth. There are creatures of your world, is mutations. It's like freaks large. You mean that is the natural evolution here on your underwater world which changed course? And created new kinds of creatures like monsters? No development has not started here, my friend. Well... Let us do something now as we have opportunity. Do not be stupid, our best hope is to stay together. Unless you have a good plan to get out of here. What a terrible place! And he who is to blame for everything is Gregory. These keepers seem people like us but their face is covered can not see their eyes. Something must be behind it. We have a short journey before reaching Vaar fourth city. You'll be safe there. We love this idea to be safe. Done with it. It's like the Middle Ages. Did you notice this clown must have brought them years ago prisoners like us. These belong here buddy... Do not look so unhappy not? Just who do not understand it. Perhaps not all be so here. Gregory remind you that we are still in scientific research. I know Charlie, but she knows the part we do not. Besides good for the morale. Do a little help with this... No not, thank you. What happens not want the help of a knight in such a place? - You are a newcomer... - Guardian... You should not do more than that should otherwise... You go looking for it... If we lose him we can not ever get out of here. You said captain what we expect, come... Come captain come on... Get them! - No! - Father will go to them in the chamber! Must be Delphi, you know how it is best to be done. Do not know what will happen to them. You know that if not done in two days dying. That is a given. I know, but now we are still people. Nice Admir welcome. Must seal your anger, you will soon feel Atlantis as your only home. - Hey where to go? - Yes where to go? At the top of the fifth city. Why? Do not worry sir Atkins! This is the newcomer Atkins. Atkins maximum name... Thanks. I know yours? Atsin, I'm including the Council of High! - My friends? - Not about you anymore. Do not worry we will ensure them. Why me treat me differently? You 'A' a superior creature... Have qualifications where honor and respect. And besides Atraxa will see the highest officer of the High Council. How do you know so much about me? For my name? Your companions will serve Atlantis, will not have the privileges that will have you. Will not be able to see you like this city. The playground of Tsinghua High. - My Lord! - Scared beautiful things? Not just that I'm used to my hometown! - All these pools, the jewels! - Water is vital for us. Do not use it enjoy it! Why represents a vital force of our past. The Tsigkoua I enjoy? Yes it is like a dream! It is perfection! Eat! Not enough salt! There imagined to see you again! Delphi... This is the job to me... Besides thee like to say thank you! You said it best in these conditions. What they told you? Nothing . You know what they plan to do with us? My father can explain better than me. Why not told us the same? What is so bad that it can not be made? I do not know Captain! But I will not wait to find out! Here being chosen is a virtue! Do admired all and above all! This is a place of meditation. The workshop intellect. My Lord, swinging! Meditation is not so difficult. But how? How feasible is a virtue as some people like you Atkins! What are you? Monitor and listen. From our planet which was dying traveled in space... We brought our cities with all our tribe... All the power and our knowledge in a single course... We spent the gravitational field of your planet earth... And we fell in vitalizer maintained water... Ocean which is above us... But trapped and destroyed in this foreign world... In this very primitive for us both the intelligent life forms... Trying to define the destiny of this world... And we hope to escape... The destiny of man, to be driven out of your mind here in Atlantis? It's impossible! We are the leaders of the red planet shape change bloodshed. The red planet? Mars. Saludos peace with Charles Atkins. Who are you? The Atraxa, Chancellor of the High Council. And welcome. Have you seen our cities our lifestyle... There sights answers? Yes... What about my friends? The Delphi said it will tell us what become here. How do you know so much? Why I am here 20 years to why. I am the captain brig him Mery Celeste. Of Mery Celeste, my holy! So the giant octopus and you lured you? My wife my children the crew... ... Wiped from the ship. Then both fucked! The Delphi can help us to get out of here. With no faith. Why you to fight. We are doomed, sir! Caught forever in this basement rock. We try to live as best we can. This guy Admir brought you as if you are scum? Is the responsible of our area! If you do not defend ourselves and we are victims of endless depth. You saw the creatures there. The Vaar are the only hope to survive. To fill the losses! Some of you will become workers and other guards! But there is no escape. For the name of my god man can at least try. What happens to him? Father? The operation is simple, does not feel pain. Without it they would die! Because of the atmosphere where you need to live? Remember you're the foreigners here in Atlantis... With your intelligence can not adjust to your breathing, living... We do not want this planet to live like home... Our destiny is elsewhere... And what you say about people who have turned into amphibious creatures... Is satisfied... Is satisfied? Knowing that they will never be able to return to the world where it is above us? - I prefer to live! - You have no choice, sir. - We have! - Not for long... Come... Come! Admira? What happens? The Zaargk attack! Where did you go Charlie? Charles Atkins does not concern you anymore! Soon the energy of the brain, will be used for the benefit of Atlantis! What do you mean by that?
