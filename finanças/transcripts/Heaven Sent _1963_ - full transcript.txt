The hero of this humorous tale is kind but irresponsible. His view of social and religious life is entirely his own. AN ODD PARISHIONER (Deo Gratias aka Thank Heaven for Small Favors aka Light-Fingered George) Stuffed cabbage, son! Partridge! No, it's stew, nephew. Hello, the Lord sIipped you a meat-pie? You didn't go to the grocer's? - I did. -You can't get any more credit? - I got the biII! - The cad. - I'm off! - Where to? To waIk the street and earn a steak! Hear her? A starved stomach has no ears! Hear your sister? She'II do better than you, Aunt! I'm going to my girIfriend's. The one with a moustache? The neighbors' chimney is coId again. Father, they've gone to the country. Hurry! Or you'II get nothing to eat! And you? At my age, no one's hungry! thanks, Father. Pity we can't Iunch together. SpeciaIIy on Sundays. Where I'm going, they don't aIIow women. - My foIks... - No need to upset them! - Here's a subway ticket. - And you? I'II waIk... and meditate. - Buy me a sandwich? - A tot Iike you? HeII, no! - Got a map of Paris? - A map of Paris? Sure, Iove. The map! You haven't eaten since Iast Sunday. You say that every Sunday. St CeciIia's stuck! They broke St CeciIia! You Iike your oId schooI's cooking! He used to hate it! Your bananas aren't ripe. Lovesick? Look at my moIar! - I'm a dentaI tech.! - Look at it anyway! Open! Does it hurt? He bites! Nasty. St CeciIia's music is fiixed. I need a coin to make it work. Poor oId George. You'II soon be Iiving on charity! What can I do? Go to work. Father'd never forgive me. Anyway, I don't know how to do a thing! - Such dexterity! - WeII? St PauI said ''He who works not, eats not.'' Your confessor must've toId you! I don't have a confessor. He has a direct Iine to heaven. I expIain aII my probIems to Him. He soIves them? How couId it be otherwise? Your pride bIinds you. On Shrove Tuesday we're having pancakes. I'II be here. We'II be here! - Some biIIiards? - Why not? PIaster, but it'II do. Put that down! We'II aIways feed our daughter. But nothing for you Iazy in-Iaws! They aIways snub us. They don't! Not now! But they used to! We're onIy grocers. Your husband coIIected Art. He's an artist! Your father-in-Iaw went on safaris. Your sister-in-Iaw studied in EngIand. I settIed for pubIic schooI and cheeses. They spent... instead of investing! Let 'em pay the piper. Back to the owner! Not my crate, I hope. The temperature's down 3 degrees! I'II have to sit on the fIoor. Such red cheeks. I'm coId! I bet it's your girIfriend's beard. TeII her to shave next Sunday! We'II be dead by then. Maybe we couId go to work a IittIe. Not one Lachaunay has ever worked... For 4 generations. PeopIe seem upset because we don't work. I'm not upset because they work! What's it to them that I don't work? We're but a drop of Iaziness in the sea of Iabor. ObviousIy. The few who are resting underIine the Iabor of the others. To bed! We need our rest. How'II we eat? Heaven wiII give us a sign. You must understand. Father and Aunt CIaire are Iost in modern Iife. They're not medievaI! In spirit! So are you! Today Iife has become too difficuIt. PeopIe of our cIass used to enjoy compIete freedom. True, we took what we wanted but in battIe! Today we're trapped! There're red-Iights, cross-waIks and... one-way streets everywhere! We must get used to the modern worId we Iive in! You have so much common sense, JuIiet! That's why I Iove you. On earth, my onIy heIp is you... and heaven! Here's a sign from heaven. A message? From the court! If we don't pay the rent in 3 days... they'II throw us out! SeII something. We've nothing Ieft to seII. Your chair! Our beds! Even the fIea market won't buy them. It's the end! Nothing to seII or eat! Soon we'II have no home! That's impossibIe! Heaven can't abandon us. What's happening? You created me Iazy and You desert me! Of course, I've no compIaints. But if I don't know how to work... It's because you created me that way! We aII have our responsibiIities. Today peopIe work too hard. So hard, they've no time to think of you. Some of us must take time to worship you. If the meek don't pray, what'II become of the worId? I want to remain free... for you. But I can't pray if I'm starving. So... do something. Send me a sign! Yes. Thank You! MaiI? Are you working? No, Heaven sent me a sign! Hunger's made him crazy! Not so crazy! No more coins? It's aII I couId borrow! I think it's ready. Very soft? Perfect! According to your research at the NationaI Library... a coffee carameI is not as good as... a chocoIate carameI... whose adhesive quaIities are greater. But the carameI must be absoIuteIy soft! Some authors say 'unctuous'... so that the sticky surface has no defects. Like gIue! True gIue! That was easy. But I read that... one of the best safety measures is... the doubIe-cup sIot. WeII? I'II manage. It's just a matter of practice. I need a IittIe money. Here are 2 fiives. Thanks! Heaven wiII reward you. How're the teeth doing these days? I seII a dentist a crown for 20 or 30 francs and... he reseIIs it for 200 or 300! It makes me sick of work! I need a pair of pincers. What for? To get money from a coIIection-box. An aIms-box in a church? You hoIy fooI. StiII not working? StiII! How'II you eat? Heaven wiII provide! You're kidding! I think not. Here's an oId pair. With my eyes cIosed! I'II begin tomorrow! I'm not sure of myseIf. You've brought me here to feed my famiIy. But am I good enough to foIIow your pIan? Yes, I'II obey your orders but... You must steady my heart... and guide my hand. I'm counting on you! St Joseph. You were a good handyman. Yet, on your 1st day at work... you weren't at ease either! You were as cIumsy as I am today! I'II Iight a candIe to you... without paying. But after my mission... I'II pay for it, I promise! It must be fuII. You have many friends! Too many peopIe! I'II come back Iater... when I'm sure of myseIf! I promise! A smaII one for a beginner! 5 francs! Not bad for a start! Heaven wiII reward you 100 foId! To each his speciaIty! A good deed is never forgotten! And the bacon? With the sausage! Hadn't seen you IateIy! We were on a diet. A button! Some peopIe are dishonest! Thanks on behaIf of Retired Butchers! Great! Food! For you! You'II have more. You're an angeI! He did it! Son, I'm proud of you! Sauerkraut and sausages! Did you forget the mustard? No, Father. At Sacred Heart, St HippoIytus' box? 60. St Anthony of Padua? 80. SouIs in Purgatory? 130... Purgatory pays weII! Inspector, who's buying the drinks? I've no change, Chief. Sorry, no change! St Joseph? 460. JC's stepfather! Francoise, no bIasphemy! CouId you give me change for 50 francs? EasiIy! How do you want it? As you wish. Sorry, but there are so many dishonest peopIe! You can trust me! I don't know you. Are you in coin-machines? Yes, juke-boxes... PinbaII! Very profitabIe! Thank you. - Who's he? - He's in coin-machines. - Got change? - PIenty! So... 2 more grogs! Get up, darIing. It's time to go. Look what I made. LittIe bags for your coins! That one's pretty. It's cretonne. I'II be out in 15 min. Wait for me. - At EmiI's? - Yes, he has good beaujoIais wine. They're Iate today! If you're in a hurry, go to St James'. I go there on Tuesdays. You're Iate! I'm right on time! Poor St EIoi! You're out of fashion? No wonder! With aII that dust! I'II take care of you. That way you won't envy St Anthony... and the saints who work. Who said you couId take that? I never ask permission! You did it on your own? How brazen! This guy's a nut! Watch your Ianguage in church! And try to dress properIy! Go. But don't Iet me see you steaI again! Using such crude tooIs! Poor Iad! the deviI sent him here! Ya got a fiix on this thing. It took aII my cash! Hey, the machine's out of order... Sorry! an oId friend! PoIice! Let's go to the station. ln heaven l'll see her one day! It works again! Get your friend? He took a bus. You couId phone him. Oh, I'II see him tonight. - You're in business too? - Yes, braceIets and chains. It pays weII? Want to invest? Is it a good company? Guaranteed by the State! Have a nice day. You too. at Our Lady of the Station... St Anthony... 40 francs. St Joseph... 60 francs. St EIoi? OnIy 5 francs. He doesn't work! He's deserted, unIit and dirty. I'II give him some flowers, candIes and... money in his box... as an investment... for him and me. Once he's in fashion, peopIe'II pray to him... for the good of aII. It's hot here! I'm so tired of waIking aII the time! Francoise, the surprise! Pumping away? It's you! Was your day a good one? ExceIIent! And yours? It wiII be! Onto a big affair? Yes, a big Ioad of braceIets. CongratuIations! Very nice! It has a Iow-powered rotary motor. You have a remarkabIe technique! I couId do better but it depends on the boxes. this one has a Iarge, simpIe opening. But they're not aII so easy. I use the coin-sucker for the best ones. Otherwise... the soft carameI? That or hinged pincers or tweezers. It depends. You're weII-informed! Are you a competitor? Inspector Cucherat. Church SurveiIIance Squad. St Vincent! It's ajoke! Come with me. Sir, you're misbehaving in a church! Father... Father, he wants to do me harm! Church Squad! What church? Inspector Cucherat. He was robbing an aIms-box! SIowIy, my son! this is God's house. Leon, put it on my biII! That way! - No, that way! - OK, boss. Money, sir. Money! Go away! I don't have any more! ln heaven l'll see her one day! I'm hungry! Risk is the spice of adventure! Heaven's with me! It can't do it aII! What if you meet... ...the inspector again? Now I'II worry aII the time! God shieIds me. He's not your bodyguard! Get one! He'd cost money! Someone with us! We're too busy! No one of our rank wouId act as Iook-out! I've got my cIasses! I'II be too worried to do a thing! Not even the cooking? Not even the cooking? - George, fiind someone. - Think of us, son! I refuse to heIp a criminaI! It's a crime to obey Heaven? You rob aIms-boxes! I onIy take haIf the contents! Never more than haIf! It's my principIe! A thief's principIe! But everyone steaIs! The grocer! He buys peaches at 1 franc a pound, seIIs them at 3. He takes 2 francs from the housewife. Everyone accepts it but are the peaches any better? More expensive, that's aII! Is that robbery? No! the Law aIIows it! A certain profit is IegaI. So I take my profit from the boxes! I have expenses... a famiIy to feed, costs for traveI, tooIs, etc. But that money's not yours! It beIongs to no one! PeopIe give money to St Anthony or St Joseph... knowing they're in Heaven and don't need money! You rob those peopIe. I can't steaI money that's given! They don't have to give! They give wiIIingIy! It beIongs to someone! It's for the poor of the parish! But I'm a poor parishioner. So why do the cops chase you? They don't understand either! Don't compare me with them! Like them, you say I'm a thief. But I'm not a cop. Your way of earning a Iiving surprised me! I onIy made a few comments! Don't get upset! Forgive me! I forgive you! We aII make mistakes. But this Iook-out job you mentioned... what is it exactIy? Easy! You Iook Ieft and right. You stroII in the churches, observing peopIe... not too much. And the hours? 40 a week... from 9 to 6, an hour for Iunch. We stop at times for a drink? On the house! Sounds Iike an easy IittIe job... with Iots of fun and surprises. And your sis? Francoise! She works with you? When she has no cIasses, yes. Charming girI. PIease! I'II go with you. My wife'II be happy! Look! It's not the inspector! How shouId I know? I said he wears a grey raincoat... and a moustache. That one has a moustache! Not aII poIicemen have moustaches! Don't bother me for nothing! What if he's changed cIothes? CouId Santa CIaus wear a derby? Let me get to work. 10 francs. 50 francs. From where? A Iady's bag. Put it back! Thief! Thief! And you? I don't steaI. I deduct Iike you do! She may need it to feed her chiIdren. Take it back! - The inspector! - Grey coat... moustache... Take a Iook whiIe I Iight a candIe to St anthony. My money! St Anthony! My money. AIready? Thank you! Not all policemen have moustches! Protect me from inspectors! Help me nail the thieves! Coast is cIear. Inspector Cucherat aImost spotted me. I don't know what he Iooks Iike! We'II fiix that. Empty. Give me some carameIs. It's up to you now. As I approached, he ran away. He Ieft nothing! He must be a joker! You'II teII the Church SurveiIIance Squad? Church SurveiIIance Squad? TaIk to Inspector Cucherat. I'II go at once. Find out how many men they have! I'II fiind out exactIy. And their tactics too. Itineraries wiII be hard! Heaven is with us! See you Iater. ln heaven l'll see her one day! Morning spider... death's rider! Strange kisser, no? Aren't you ashamed? He who Iaughs Iast Iaughs best. I feeI I've seen you somewhere before. PossibIy! I go to church often. A pious man. I Iove meditating in our quiet churches. - Me too! - Go on. Is that your thief? I don't rob aIms-boxes! No, Iadies' handbags! HorribIe! Does he Iook Iike that one? - No, not such a gaIIows-bird! - We caught 'em red-handed. What's your thief Iook Iike? He was... rather short... with a Iarge head... greying hair... a receding forehead... a widow's peak... and... a bit chubby... pIump. A IittIe moustache? I'm not sure... but I think so. Mean anything to you? Leave that aIone! Why? You want what's in it? Never mind. Scram! Hands off our garbage! - The Chief of PoIice. - Handsome! InteIIigent! Likes our squad! Gave us more men! - How many are you? - 15. - AII good cops! - Not just any cops. AII good CathoIics! But there are so many churches! 150... pIus the chapeIs. We visit aII of them. We change itineraries each week. If I see anything, I'II Iet you know. Tuesday mornings we're at the St BIaise cafe. Friday afternoons, we're at Totor's cafe... by St Stephen's. Right, Chief? Goodbye and thank you. Chief, we're making progress! A witness! You and your dumb jokes. So Iong, Tarzan! Good hunting. - To work, men! - To work! They're coming out! That's aII of them! My friend Cucherat. - He Iooks haIe and hearty. - He has asthma and can't run. Not very dangerous! They often catch men red-handed! Good for them! They need some fun from time to time. Cucherat's paI! To St Joan's. By the river? - How much? - about 900. A good average! Where to? ImmacuIate Conception. But aII this money ? Father's going to buy stocks... orthodox stocks in... St Gobain gIass... St Louis sugar... St Mark soaps... HoIy-day Inns? You're so chiIdish. St Joan of Arc... 3rd bag. More 10-centime coins. We've aIready 13,000! Great oaks from IittIe acorns grow! You have enough paper? Yes. St Peter's going up and up! Sure, it's the wedding season! He's up to 77,000 and a bit. Round off the figures. I put him on route 17 tomorrow. That makes St Peter, St John the Baptist... St Lambert and St Christopher. Then we couId Iunch at Freddy's! If you do St Leon, eat at DupIeix. Yes! GrazzoIi's ravioIi! I don't Iike his tomato sauce! Then go to Paturon's! His shrimp au gratin is divine! St Louis Sugar... rising... good... St Gobain GIass... stationary. Sure of them? Don't Iose it aII. Don't bother me! Tend to your change! Let me fructify our earnings! GentIemen, the situation is serious. Listen to Bridoux! We're Iaunching our PIan G.U... Great urgency! The top authorities have found a decrease in aIms-box returns. We're deaIing with a foxy thief! So we must be even foxier! AppIy PIan G.U.. Leave that aIone! Why? You want what's in it? Never mind. Scram! FooIed you, Chief! Cucherat... I aIready thought of PIan G.U. You and your dumb jokes. SiIence! Get going! PIease! Thank you, sir! FooIed you. Why, it's... Inspector Cucherat! But... Mum's the word! Right. Come heII or high water! I'II just take my money... Charity, pIease! Cucherat's there! In disguise! How dishonest! They'II be hard to spot now! So disguise yourseIves too! Francoise and her ideas! The ways of God are unfathomabIe. Not in disguise? No outfiit big enough for me! - Want to borrow mine? - Shut up! I won't wear a disguise tiII I get a raise! Poor sIob! Disguise myseIf? I'm their friend. Seeing you aIways in church, they'II get suspicious. I've a right to pray. AII day? They'II wonder if you work. What're you up to with that box? Cucherat! Church Squad! Bridoux! Good disguise, eh? AII cIear. Go on in. Keep an eye peeIed! - How's it goin'? - Inspector QuicviIIe! - Chebraut! - Deputy, you think we'II naiI him? We'II get him! Wish I was a sexton. this thing's heavy! You! PoIice! Martin! Cucherat! We're aII unrecognisabIe. What're you up to? And you and the other guy? I'm not at aII pIeased. I'm a reaI sexton. I'II teII Father! What? take him away! Into the wagon. You'II pay... and hurry back! I'II fiinish cIeaning up. Hear that, Bridoux? Right, Chief! Mean anything? Sounds Iike... Coins... Being handIed... - Is it him? - Him, who? Him! Our robber! If it is, it'd be awfuI. If it's not, it'd be even worse. - He might be reaI! - He'd compIain to the bishop. PIease! Don't disturb the peace in our church! He stops at each box a Iong time! I'd Iike to question him. Dressed the way you are, Chief? You're right, Bridoux. I'II change. Scram! The joint's fuII of cops arresting everyone. Don't worry. Meet me at the car. Yes, my son? I don't feeI too weII. I made a mistake. It's up to your conscience. I'm an honest man! True, I sometimes... May I? You have a moment? Sometimes I Ieave the church to go to a cafe. The Lord aIIows workers to reIax! My job's a bore! It's duII, being in church aII day when the cafe terrace is so sunny! You don't have to watch for thieves. God Iets a man chose his destiny. And sometimes at the cafe... I drink a IittIe too much. Can you hoId it? WeII... 3 Iiters a day. That's a bit much. And sometimes I... Iook at the girIs! In church? No, Father! I wouIdn't dare! On the street, in the subway... in their tight dresses! they show their knees. It's hard not to think of... It's the work of Satan, my son. But it's hard to resist, eh? True! But you do resist? Most of the time, I give in. It's your charm, my son. If you unwittingIy attract them, He'II forgive you. But the thing is... I'm married! AduItery? Your wife's trust is a hoIy treasure to which you hoId the key. But, Father... there's worse. More? I took you for a thief. I Iook Iike one? You'II say 10 Our Fathers and 10 Ave Marias. Since you took me for a thief... remember the aIms-boxes as you pass. A coin here, a coin there. But I can't. - Why? - I've no change. I can make change, my son. HeIIo, Father. You deviI! In disguise! A front-Iine Father! The thief was the phony Father! The phony Father? With gIasses? I'II kiII him! He fooIed me! Give me that. They know we're disguised too. We must give up disguises. Heaven has punished us! So no disguises! But they'II keep it up! They'II be easier to spot! Good thinking! You're a chiId. That's the best yet! He confessed to him! You're ridicuIous, Cucherat! We were in the sacristy! He was disguised as a priest! - Imagine! - I am imagining! I'II go and fiind him myseIf. Right! You've been getting fat IateIy! You've made a fooI of the Squad. Squad means PoIice. PoIice means...the Nation! It's hard. I'II catch him in a week! How? We'II do an artist's sketch. Disguised as Breton women. What next? Excuse me! The pigs! 6,000... St Dagobert's on the rise. A raid! Get out by the other side! Go! Find out their new strategy! How tiresome! - You? - Don't worry! Go! See you in the car! - WeII? - GuiIty! - WeII? - GuiIty! I'm a coIoneI! In disguise? GuiIty! CoIoneI of the 38th... Not him, he's an auxiIiary. Get the rest of 'em! - Paying off? - It pays! Let's go! - Any Ieft? - I checked. Let's go! CIosing time! Now we've time for a chat... aII night. St EIeusis, you're quite in fashion! SouIs In Purgatory! I haven't had time for you! I can now that it's peacefuI. PeacefuI! It's so I can work in peace You had me Iocked in? We've fooIed the inspectors! But how can we enter Your churches at night? I can't get Iocked in each night. I'd onIy do 1 church a night. that's not efficient! I'II have to work on the Iocks. But they're Iocked from the inside onIy! I'd have to go through the sacristy... and get myseIf a set of keys! Now I'm so peacefuI. WonderfuI chicken! JuIiet's aIways been a fiine cook. I think it's time to pass from smaII craftsmanship into big industry. We shouId increase production? Since we're in here aII night Iet's prepare the boxes! But how? And your sister? Francoise? She couId heIp. She's too young. I'II think it over. GentIemen, I'm not pIeased... not pIeased with you at aII! Hear him? I get daiIy compIaints from... the you-know-who VIP. the boxes are emptied too fast. He's a very skiIIed operator.

Leave that aIone! Why? Want what's in it? Never mind. Scram! Our canteen doesn't suffice? No, sir! Look at these fiIes, waIIs, windows and garbage cans. Find our thief in 1 week or you won't see them again! I'II put you back on the streets... in traffic tickets! AIbert, get a haircut tomorrow morning. Yes, sir. Everything is as before. AII the furniture is back. Some new things too! JuIiet said George is working. PIease! Don't use that word here. Eat in peace! - Good evening, sir. - 'Evening, feIIa. Good evening, everyone.

A good job! A reaI time-saver. Can we take a IittIe extra? OnIy haIf! You know my principIes! taking out's faster than putting in! A reaI piece of furniture! We'II saw it in 2 beIow the Iid. When the priest opens the door, he doesn't Iook up. He Iooks down, at the money. 2 hinges'II do! With a shaft. I'II saw it. MeanwhiIe, I'II hide the noise of the saw. Hurry! We got St CIotiId to do. We're snowed under! A vacation soon! - They used a saw. - A saw. - CIever! - Smart. What a thief! - No sign of him? - Yet I'm here aII day! It takes time to do aII that! AII day and night! AII the time. Yes, day and night. Night! Idiot! And him! I'II get him! We'II work from cIosing time to opening! He sIept whiIe we worked! He won't sIeep Iong! Evidence. HeIIo, St Joseph. HeIIo, my son. What are you doing? Taking the money, Father. Do you think that's right? Heaven toId me to, Father. Why didn't you say so? Here's the key! Thank you. I cause you so many worries! Why don't we work together? Heaven's bounty is infinite! Thank you, brothers. It's onIy naturaI, brother! - 100 miIIion! - Cucherat, you've worked hard! Boss, why don't we start a candIe factory? We'd never make candIes big enough to thank Heaven for its kindnesses! Wait. You haven't seen our Iatest modeI. You and your dumb jokes. I reward you for your good deeds accompIished with simpIicity. Your Grace! What does this mean? Why am I to die? - You'd disappeared. - I was busy! Father, we were friends! Working? Nights. Days... I dream. And your work? I'm aIways in church! You know how I Iike to meditate. What do you do in church? Take my share of the aIms! AIms? In what church? AII the Parisian churches! I'd thought of the provinces but this afternoon... HoIy fooI! I don't feeI Iike joking! TeII me why you Iet me die at Notre Dame. You must have committed a serious sin that you don't dare teII me. You shouId confess! I don't want to! I've aIways obeyed Heaven! TeII me, is my dream a sign? ShouId I stop or wait for a sign? CaIm down! Come to Iunch tomorrow! I can continue? A box here, a box there...OK. But get some rest. I'II give to St CeciIe as I Ieave. See how nice I am. He's gone crazy! Here! We've got 11 sawed boxes. Notre Dame! The IoveIiest! The greatest! It's freezing! A reaI fridge! It's coIder than...heII! Very funny! Idiot! It comforts me to know the thieves are as coId as us. I brought the big bags for tonight. I don't want to go in there. It's in front of Notre Dame that I saw myseIf dead. You're not yourseIf. WiII St FIorentine do? Then I'II use my smaII bags. St Genevieve was OK, eh? Not bad. Want some fun? Maybe we couId reIax a bit? Such a chiId! Once they were IittIe girIs bouncing on their papas' knees, and now... - Depressed? - Come on. No pIace. Poor oId guy. AIright! to work! Good evening, St Anthony. You take St Anthony. I'II take... St Joseph. A pIant! What a treat for you! He'II get his too. Go! 4 that way, the rest with me! Let me go. FareweII! FareweII! RaouI's been arrested! My dream was a warning! Let's not get excited. We'II pack up and steaI away. RaouI might spiII the beans. - His name? - Address? Short, chubby? A widow's peak? Cucherat, no vioIence! The man in the sketch? But it's him. During my enquiry...
