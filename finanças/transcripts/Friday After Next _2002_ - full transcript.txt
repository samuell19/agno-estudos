It's a damn shame. All I want is two fat bitches and some cheeseburgers, so cheeco can lick on them, and two-years' supply of rolling paper. Yeah, two pieces of Bologna, yeah, baby. This gonna be good right here. I'm so hungry. What the hell you doin' in my house, eatin' a big-ass sandwich and shit?

I hit him, like, four times. I would've been a professional boxer, but I was in special education. I'm telling you, I was whupping his ass! Craig got to fighting with him... Check out the bedrooms. Sure. So, what else did he get? Like I said, he took all of our presents, he took my cd collection... Cds... He even took day-day's baby pictures. Pictures? Oh, yeah, and he got our speaker, man, with all our rent money in it. Rent money! Sit your ass down! Not the rent money! You ain't about to do nothin'. Who got the rent money? Shit! Jumping up like you "Mr. Get bad." Where was you when he was beating my ass with that tree? Craig, my leg is hurting. Good! Yeah, he got the rent money. All of it. You're positive he was dressed like Santa Claus? Jolly, white, fat guy, little red suit, couple elves packing the bags? He's a project Santa Claus. Picture ol' dirty bastard in a Santa Claus suit. Can you picture that? Do you know who ol' dirty bastard is? No, I'm not big on that. You ought to be nervous, you a black cop. You two motherfuckers huddle up or something and find this dude. Stay right there. I ain't goin' nowhere. Calm down. I'm calm. You're gonna sit in the car. Do your fucking job! You're pushing all the wrong buttons, pal. We the victims, man. We the victims. That victim shit is way overblown. Just sit there and shut up. Asshole. Santa Claus strikes again. Yeah. Makes me want to go home and lock up all my shit. You better stop talking to them police like that. Shut up, you better stop talking to me like that. I can kick your ass for the way you acting this morning. Ain't that a bitch? We gonna still have our Christmas party? How the fuck we gonna have a Christmas party with our apartment looking like this? We can't cancel the party, man! What about the hos we had coming down here? I invited some nice-ass girls, said they gonna fuck for a buck, do something strange for a little piece of change, and I know we gonna make them holler for a dollar. One said they was gonna suck my dick from the back. I ain't never had that ever happen to me. I'm trying go see what that be like right there... Look, I don't give a shit about you, that party. All I got to worry about is the rent. - It was your idea to use half the rent money... - No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't. Whoa whoa whoa! Dix, I think we got something here. Well, well, whose is this? Actually, it's both of ours. No, it ain't. It is, but it's for municipal uses only. I mean, he got cataract, lazy eye, little glaucoma. See that eye right there? Little shot of gonorrhea, see? Do you guys have any idea what we can do to you for this? No. Juvenile center? We can make your Christmas much worse than what it already is. Being that it's Friday, that means you're not gonna see a judge till possibly Monday. - Aw! - Maybe. But since we're nice guys, we're just going to confiscate this plant, take it with us, until we find this Santa Claus character. Oh, that's fucked up, too. Oh, hey, and when we find Saint Nick, what do you all want us to do to him, you know? Cracked ribs, fractured skull, little eye gouge? Fractured skull. Beat the shit out that motherfucker. Eye gouge, that's the shit. And an eye gouge. I say you stick a plunger in his ass like they did in New York... Fractured skull. This is officer Brian dix, I'm officer Alvin hole.

Happy holidays, miss pearly. Police running all in and out of the building! What the hell is going on?! Somebody broke in our apartment this morning and stole all our stuff. That bullshit security. I sure hope they didn't get the rent money 'cause you two niggas been ducking and dodging me for about three weeks now. Me? I... Today is the day you motherfuckers is gonna kick in.

We ain't never gonna get no pussy in these clothes, man. I'm gonna get some. Tasha, how we look? Like a couple of rent-a-cops. What about them rented tits? See, the clothes don't make the player, the player make the clothes. Rent-a-cops get pussy, too. I'm not no rent-a-cop, I'm a top flight security and don't you never forget it.

Hurry up! ♪ Hang all the mistletoe ♪ ♪ I'm gonna get to know you better ♪ ♪ This Christmas ♪ ♪ And as you... ♪ About a year ago, my pops quit his dog-catching job and went into business with my uncle elroy. They opened up a spot called brothers Barb-b-q. Tastes so good, make you wanna slap your mama. You might've seen the commercial. Y'all tired of eating that barbecue from up the street where they give you more sauce than they give you meat? Well, bring your big ass down to bros. Bar-b-q, 15837 south crenshaw boulevard, that's right off Manchester. Bros. Bar-b-q, tastes so good, make you wanna slap your mama! Don't it, Willie? Yeah, boy. Hey, mama. What the hell you want?! Ain't but one location, so it's nearest you. You might've missed it. They only had enough money for a 15-second spot. But, anyway, my pops got me and day-day these jobs at the same strip mall... Are you ready? ...as Christmas-help security. Look, day-day, we only security guards, okay? Ghetto security guards at that. We ain't cops, we ain't america's most wanted, NYPD blue... None of that shit you watch. We something like them. No, nothing like it. So all we gonna do... Take it easy, make this money, you gonna watch your temper. I ain't gotta watch shit. You gonna treat people right, talk to people right... No, I'm not. 'Cause you can get your ass kicked around here real quick. So? I don't care nothin' about it getting out of hand. And I ain't getting into no shit because of you. This is a job, man. This ain't an adventure. This is real. And I wanna let you know, I'm not having it. Everybody's a suspect today. And I told you I'm a player. And I don't care none about none of that. Uh-huh. Damn! Come on, player, get your ass out. Aw, man. Fucking... you remedial! What does that mean? Retarded. That wasn't nothin'. You dumb-ass, let's go! I mess up all the time. Come here, come here, look. That's him! Let's get that mother... Ohh! Get him! Get him! We gonna whup your ass! Craig, day-day! Uncle Willie! What the hell y'all doin' to me? What's going on? Day-day, damn! I didn't know that was you, pop! I thought you was somebody else! Willie, what are you doing to the boys back there? I ain't doin' nothin'. I'm counting my money at the cash register. These fools knocked the hell out of me. We just made a mistake. Day-day just ran in and jumped on daddy! He's lying, daddy! Why you beating up on Santa Claus? What did he do to you? He broke in our house and stole our presents. And Craig let him do it. Why, Craig? How you gonna blame that on me? 'Cause you... You did! I tried to fight him and day-day... You lie! I was screaming. He wouldn't even help. He's lyin'. Well, what did you do, day-day? He didn't do nothin'. He stayed asleep the whole time. Can I tell my story? I ain't do shit, daddy, but he could've did something about it! What did he look like? He looked like Bobby brown in a goddamn Santa Claus suit. I heard about him. They call him "the Santa Claus crook" or "the Santa Claus crip" or something like that. He robbed a lady out here in the parking lot last week. Called her a "ho ho ho" and kept on running. Who the fuck are you? Oh, I'm cookie, the new waitress. And, um, elroy's new girlfriend. Damn daddy, you got another... You gonna catch something. You should've kept sugar's nasty ass. What happened to her? I kicked her country ass to the curb, hooked up with her little sister, that's how we players roll! Elroy, you ain't no player. Read my lips, you ain't no player. You don't know nothin' about being a player. Betty done had your ass pussy-whipped for about 30 years. Nobody got me pussy-whipped. I whips pussy! You boys look really good with your rent-a-cop outfits on. Yes, very attractive. This is top flight security. We ain't no rent-a-cops. Daddy, how I look? Da da-da nah! Like a damn snitch. Aw, man, that's cold. Like you ready to go tell on somebody right damn now. And where your flashlight at? You're rent-a-cop, you're supposed to have flashlights, you got to shine some damn body. We're supposed to get handcuffs, flashlights, taser guns... Two German Shepherds. Y'all must ain't heard what happened to the last security guards they had around here. What happened? Elroy, mama's in the kitchen with the sauce. Let's go... Aw, shit, the sauce, move! What happened to the other two s... Wait a minute. Go say "hello" to your grandmother. Come on, let's go, move your big ass! What happened with the last two security guards? Mama! Wake up, mama! What the hell you want, Roy? You're burning the sauce again. Give me the spoon. We're not gonna hit you, mama. Lost your mind since Willie slapped you. Get your hands off her, Willie! What happened to her? You should've never let her get into the commercial, elroy. Got no business working. You're the one gave her a concussion, Willie. You were supposed to be acting. Should've smacked the hell out of you. How she doing? Hey, mama, big mama, you all right? Who are you? It's Craig, mama. Who Craig? Don't worry about it. Your oldest grandson. The smart one, not day-day. She still having 30-second black-outs and blurred vision. Get the hell out of here! Why you always playing with her all the time? That's enough damn salt there, Willie! I know what I'm doing. Don't nobody want all that goddamn salt in their potato salad! Y'all argue too much, god, what the hell wrong with y'all? Y'all should get married. Why are you in so much competition with me? You jealous, Willie. I can't help it. I look better than you do. You don't. I cook better than you. You can't. My dick is bigger than yours. It was cold that night. Think of this, last year at this time, you had won the lotto. Over a million dollars. Anybody else would be living in the French riviera. You're back here cooking pig feet with me at brothers bar-bar-barbeque. You tied-tongue dog catcher! You best go check on the sauce. Your mama's out on her feet again. Dumb-ass dog catcher. "I'm a lotto stud, lotto fucking stud." So after pops and unc argued for another 15 minutes, it was time to meet our new boss. His name is moly. He ran the whole strip mall and owned holy moly donuts. But, trust me, don't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, eat there. We'll take the usual, moly. Hey, moly! Hey, Willie. How you doing, boy? Good, buddy. Merry Christmas, buddy. Happy hanukkah, I'Chaim. These are my boys. I'll be with you in just one minute, buddy. Take your time. Damn, Craig. Just be still.

I have to come back there with a flashlight and catch her. You guys are supposed to be big tough guys. You don't need all these gidgets, gadgets, huh? All you need is this here.

I ain't playin' with you, noogah! Didn't I tell you I was gonna fire your ass if you hit something else? Nope, I didn't hear that part, pinky. After you hit that little retarded boy with the fucked up walk. You're costing me money, c.W. He still breathing. Get your ass back in the car! Ohh, noogah! All right, motherfucker, let's go. Come on, noogah! Get your ass in the car, come on! You done hit Santa Claus! That was pinky's limo. Look, he hit Santa ass, come on! Uh-huh! Uh-huh, got your ass! Turn over! D.O.A. Should I tell him or you? Let's both tell him. You got knocked the fuck out! Bitch! Got his ass. Got his ass. ♪ Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Sega Genesis ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Street fighter ii ♪ Ha ha! Yo, day-day. What's up? I'm glad we got our rent money back, baby. What are we gonna do with that fool? I don't know, po-po's will get his dumb-ass sooner or later. Ho ho ho, motherfucker, ha ha ha! There you have it, another Friday gone, another problem solved. We just took our stuff back to the party and left Santa Claus on the roof for the police to get. Far as I know, he's still up there talking shit. Pimp down, pimp missing in action! And money Mike, you know, he's still getting chased by Damon all through the hood. There's a loud party upstairs that's keeping me up. Could you please send a unit? Miss pearly kept on hating on us. We didn't even care, we kept on partying. My uncle got drunk and eventually passed out. Look at pops... You know, he showed his ass till the po-po's came. Open the door, let's do this! Put down the b-b-barbecue. But all they wanted was some more weed. So we hooked them up, and I even kept day-day's dumb-ass occupied. And a German Shepherd! Ooh! Ooh! That's until my moms walked in on him. And me, you know how a player do. I convinced Donna to bring her fine ass back to the party... Got her in my room, slid the dresser in front of the door, and got myself a early Christmas present. You know! I'll beat-box your ass!
