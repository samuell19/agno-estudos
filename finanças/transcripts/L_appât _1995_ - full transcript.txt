Isn't Adjani gorgeous! I read she got 10 million francs for her last movie. Yeah, well, Julia Roberts got $8 million. No comparison. How much is that in francs? Tons. They must be cutting down on subways at night? "Have you ever had sexual breakdown? "a) no erection: 44% "b) lost erection during intercourse: 40% "c) premature ejaculation: 37% d) no ejaculation: 27%." Joel's problem is getting started. Here's an interview about blow-jobs! "Women who won't..." Well, too bad for them! "Though with some girls, I wouldn't eat their pussy!" There's something awesome on page 96. "Have you ever had sex: a) with your partner tied? "b) with yourself tied? c) by phone." Imagine, 12% did! "d) with two girls e) and using food." 28%! That's gross! I wouldn't say no to chocolate spread! Here, from the shop. Super! Thanks! You swiped it? With what he pays, I don't buy his duds! Did you really meet him? Not yet, but I saw a photo of them together. You'll see. Jean-Claude knows everybody. It looks great on you. Really classy! I'm a bit nervous! Relax! Jean-Claude's a pussycat. Anyway, without contacts you're nowhere. You just get shit work. Gotta choose in life. - Hi, Lolotte. - Hello, angel. This is Karine. Can I take your jackets? - Hello, Jean-Claude. - Hello, kitten. This is my friend Karine. I told you about her. Yes, of course... You were right about her... She's exquisite. Hello, love. How are you? See? I wasn't lying. Check out the photos. There's somebody missing. He can't put 'em all up! - Where's the fire? - What fire? Don't gulp it down! You sip a Carlton Pêche. Okay, but I was dying of thirst. So, how goes it, kiddies? I may have someone for you. His line is shoes, but he has connections in fashion and the movies. He plays tennis with the guy who made "The Visitors". You'll see, he's a nice guy. What area interests you? Like her. But being a hostess would be okay. Jean-Claude introduced me to a girl... I had her over, she was tickled pink... Champagne, caviar, laser disks... The full treatment. And then? And then: Taxi, nighty-night... I'm not big on sleeping pills. - What d'you drive? - A Mercedes. Jean-Claude can give you the dealer's name... Hey, fella... Step over here. Alain! Let me have your coat. I'm not staying... Red suits you. Two beauties all for your Ionesome? Greedy, no? I do my best. Nathalie, Karine... Alain Perez, a friend. Video and electronics... At your service, ladies. Tennis tomorrow? Doubles? No, I'll be kaput tomorrow. I'm inspecting the shops. And those repairs for my big screen? I had a chick over who wrecked it. - Call me. - $5000, old man... How many stores? About 20, I think. You think? You're not sure? Since you insist, I'll have a drink. This wasn't planned. Mr and Mrs B. Richmyson have a son. What's his name? Ewell. Ewell B. Rich-my-son. Sure you can't tonight? I can drop your friend off... I told you, I can't. I've got my monthlies. Just a little something... A little After Eight, no? Some other time. I'll come with Karine. If there are two of you, I'm game. Don't forget that producer? No, don't worry. A promise is a promise. Say, Jean-Claude, was the salmon fresh? Straight from the fish market! You do look green around the gills. Here's my card. Can I reach you somewhere? Sure... I don't have a pen. This is a gorgeous Mont-Blanc! Keep it. I lose them anyway. I don't feel well. Must be hepatitis. I know, I'm done for. Here... I lose 'em too. I always forget where I park. Here we are! - Why not keep the pen? - I don't like being bought. It's not Chabrol who's directing that film. Premiere says it's Lelouch. Jean-Claude knows more than Premiere. No comparison! Let's go, girls. That door was forced. The other side. Why give that guy a bum number? He's a stranger. And it's me who does the calling. Not "Scarface" again! "They went and spoiled my $800 suit." Great cake, Bruno! They went and spoiled my $800 suit. We were with a guy who didn't know how many stores he had... He's in shoes. It looks like good money. Piaget watch, Mercedes, Mont-Blanc, the works. He looks like a shoe salesman. These pants just get tighter! The number he did on us! Really too much! "You look like Vanessa Paradis, but with more class." Karine pulled a face! I'm meeting the guy who did "The Visitors". He's gonna do a sequel. With you? You're no comedian! What d'you know? My favorite scene! Pacino's awesome here! I'm - how d'ya say - paranoid. Cut the crap, Nat! Are you lying on my T-shirt? Stay still! It always gives you nightmares. Give that back! Kissyface, first, and I'll give it back. That was mean! Anyway, I'm really kaput. And we've seen "Scarface" 20 times! Clear out, Bruno! I work! I'm not on welfare. It's almost over. Clear out! Screw it! I'm going to sleep. Shit, my address book! I'll forget tomorrow. I'm turning in. Take the VCR. Not tonight. Good night. Can't it wait? No, it can't. Otherwise I forget. So..."Alain Perez"... Great! I needed someone under P. What a slow writer! You take ages. I don't make spelling mistakes, like some people we know. This glue doesn't stick. Hi, Sami. How goes it? Okay, and you? - How's business? - Don't ask! Business is bad. No money coming in... And after the VAT, electricity, salaries, there's nothing left. The Yanks buy from Taiwan, the Danes from Holland... We're cooked. There's one solution... The States. The Naf-Nafs made a killing there. Say, I heard about your dad... A tax inspection... That's awful! It'll kill the old man. Can you inventory these shirts? And neatly, please. Satisfied with the kid? Very satisfied. A good worker. Look, lipstick on the collar. Put it aside for the laundry. They try everything on and never buy. Quit complaining and move. You're not my boss! He may be soon. That'll be the day! Cut it out! She's cute when she's mad, no? My dad was asking for it. He talks too much. Shooting his mouth off about the rotten government and all. Don't bother picking me up! I was just talking to Mr Tapiro! Yeah, then you go and say "Satisfied with the kid?" And grab my ass like some macho jerk. The great man talking shop! Unbelievable! Don't like it? Then leave! You'll do the leaving. You live in my flat. Your mom gave you the flat! But not to you. What's that mean? I've got other worries. Oh yeah! Which ones? Is your Walkman broken? I lost my checking account. Your account? Why? My dad cut me off because I can't find a job. I'm broke! So spare me your girl troubles. Your dad's a jerk. Don't you dare! My dad's a prince, you hear! But you did act macho! How'd it go? I got sacked. I didn't sell any. - They gave you that one? - No, I bought it myself. The man's whacko! It'll be my birthday gift. It's your birthday? They found me in November in a supermarket caddy. Abandoned in a caddy? - How old were you? - Not old enough to know. He slept in parking lots. Bruno's street-wise, right? If it hadn't been for me... By the way, I lost my checking rights. America's the answer... Pret-à-porter! There's a boom in Florida. Where the hell are my cigarettes? Bastien, Gêrard. Dentist. Give that back. François Duprês, lawyer. Faubourg St Honorê. Chic address! - Can't I know your lovers' names? - Give that back! Wholesaler... producer... lawyer... Not hard up, are they? Clip 'em and America, here we come! Maybe you should glue another star on. Cut the crap! A Coke... Another beer? Sure, Budweiser. An orangeade for me. Can you settle now? My last bank note. The splendor of bygone days! Where'd you dig that up? "The splendor of doggone days!" Talks like a book... "Bygone", doofus! Yeah, same thing! Gotta find cash! There must be a way. You put in too much milk. Your pal owed you how much? $350... And he pays you with a gun! He didn't have a dime. You always lend and they never repay. I hate it when it rains. Hi, you... I'm seeing a guy tonight about being a weathergirl. You had a tryout. It was premature. Your tryouts go nowhere. At least I move my butt! No, Grandma! No crease! Have mercy! But a crease is more elegant. No, it's zilch! Any more chocolates? Look in the box. There must be some left. - And your friend Veronica? - Nathalie. Can't she do the ironing? She works. What does she do? She's a salesgirl-model. When are you going to get a job? Quit picking your teeth! Then pay me a dentist. How much did she give you? 2000 francs. She's swell. Wish I'd had a granny like that. The Naf-Nafs were dropouts, too. - Who? - Naf-Naf brothers. I'll explain it to you. I discussed it with friends of my dad. To get started, we need 10 million francs, at most. Where there's a will, there's a way. I've got it all worked out. Store space, first. You rent your first shop. Then, you have the stock plus shipping, because your jeans are made in Asia. So, a container of 5000, that makes $25000 minus tax. With the dollar at 5.35, that makes... Shit, I mucked up on a zero. 10 million francs isn't nothing! The thing is to work fast. If you don't make it by 25, you're washed up. Cute... You wear garters? No, they're stockings. Funny, no? No, stop! - Wait! - Just a little... No, not tonight! I have a boyfriend! Stop! Get lost, bitch! This thing's too tight. It's an XL. Not recommended for claustrophobics. You okay, Nat? No, I'm not okay. What happened? That bastard tried to rape me in his car. I put up a fight. He dumped me like some whore. He called me names. I wound up on the Champs Elysêes with cars all around. Not a single taxi would stop for me. I'm fed up! You're gun's hurting me. I feel dirty. I'm gonna brush my teeth. Well? Will three do? I'll get a carton tomorrow. Sure thing. Not my breasts, Eric. My back... Just my back. I don't feel like making love tonight. Let's just cuddle. It's never enough for you. It is sometimes. I like it when you're nice, too. - Sex isn't nice? - It depends. He turned the sound up again. Let's go to sleep. Bruno and I talked things over. For the money, we're gonna pull some holdups. Have you blown a fuse? You're putting me on! I'm not putting you on. We've got a plan. Your address book is our passport to America. And "Under Siege" with Steve Seagal? Take it. It's in the Top 10. What do I do in America? You'll be store manager. Store manager... Nothing to it. I did it once. How about this one? No, it's French. Must be crap. But that was in your dad's store. Anyway, it didn't work out. America's not France! It's all done by computer there. And the laws don't get up your nose. It's easy to fire people. No employee contributions, no social taxes, audits, VAT, all that shit. And here I am still waiting for my welfare check. - "Nightmare on Elm Street 6"! - Take it. We saw the first five. You always hide your eyes. But I still enjoyed them. How do I tell him he's fired? Who's fired? The Yank in your shop. It's not a shop, it's a chain store. I can't fire him, I don't speak English. Nathalie neither. I know a bit more... "Bodyguard"..."Total Recall"... What's a bodyguard, anyway? You can take a crash course. Berlitz isn't for the dogs! Now that he's gonna pull a holdup, he's so touchy. That's it! Louder! I mean it! You get hung up on details. We can still ask questions, no? You think small. To make it, you have to think big. - America's no "Hexagon". - Hexa-what? France. He talks different now too. What are the circled X's for? Give it to me! Your fingers are greasy! For guys who can't give me a job, but have a good contact. The more circles, the better the contact. You can't overlook anything to find a job. I'm starting a new system: Color circles. Red for important, blue for so-so, green for who knows? Easier to read and prettier. This lawyer here... Why only two X's? Working for a lawyer isn't my thing. But they make a bundle. And they only declare half. Doctors must make the real bread, dentists especially. I just saw a dentist, under N. Boulevard Voltaire. Not a great address. But he drives a Porsche and a Jaguar. Stop putting out your cigarettes in the plates! It's disgusting! It's not a plate, it's a tin. The duck was greasy. Even so. We'd be better off in the chic area. They're loaded. They don't all have 10 million in a safe. They might. You should see my dad's friends. We oughta hit them, then. I'm taking all the risks, you know. It's my address book, my contacts, my restaurant. What risks? They take you to their pad and you open the door. Then we take over. Where d'you see risks? What is a Pan Bagnat? A dwelling? A sandwich! A sandwich, dammit! If you're scared, we can find another girl. Know any with my address book? I mean so it's not always you on the line. Like Patricia? Sandwich, dickheads! That pisses me off! I knew it was a sandwich! I coulda won the goddam jackpot! Why not? She just lost her job. How do we share? In equal parts. Why? They found a great place for rehearsals. A space that belonged to his dad. Just like in a movie. It's awesome. Eric looks great these days. Yeah, he's not just anybody. I can tell you, he'll go far. France is too small for him. Too small-minded. I'm just plain whacko nuts about him. I hope it lasts. It's no accident that Eric and I are together. Because we both see big. How about you and Alex? We split. But I kept the jacket, so that's all I care about! There's the front door. You sit on the fabric. So it's his bedroom. Or living room with a couch. You come in with him. - You're the guy. - Okay. Oh, ducky, let's have fun on the sofa. I hope his couch is cleaner. And what do you say? "What a yucky living room". Don't screw around! You gotta get him out of the room. Maybe you can both sit on the couch and watch TV... That's it. Come over to my pad and we'll watch some TV. Shit, that won't do! Concentrate... We're here to work. It's hard enough. I'll ask for juice. Check that the kitchen's far. In boojy homes, it's never near the living room. Now there's a pro... Once you're alone, you run to open the door. I'll pretend to. Now, come back, Nat. We wait outside the door a sec... Suspense... Then we come in. Bruno, you tie the guy up. Nat, you run for it! Hold on... Won't it look fishy if you let me go? Not automatically. You're spooked, you scram. Real burglars wouldn't let a chick get away so she can call the cops. She's got a point. Then we tie you up too. Okay. Didn't you think of that? If we let the girls go, they'd run to the cops. Think they'd go and blow the whistle on us? You flipped? They're no dummies! You're the dummy! Why? We're not supposed to know the girls. It was my idea, not yours. Big deal! But it wasn't yours, it was Patricia's. Like I said, it wasn't yours. The shit I take from her! Without me, your whole plan... I must be dreaming! How do we make them talk? We can't plan everything. You have to know how to improvise. Laurent's the best. I was at his place for drinks. I have his door code. It's full of old paintings. We can't sell paintings. But they often hide safes behind paintings. You've got a point there. And it's a fancy area. Sure, he's no beggar. And he's got the hots for me. To get what they want, they'll do anything. That's where the talent comes in. So, how about it? Laurent it is! Turn on the speaker. Quiet! This takes concentration. Laurent Guillemain, please. Speaking... Hello, this is Nathalie. Your little doe-eyed bombshell. Ah, yes! Nathalie... How are you? When do I see you? You had me all worked up last time. I love your laugh. My bombshell or my doe laugh? Your girlish laugh. So, and that dinner? Tomorrow, if you want. Okay. It's a date. Want to pick me up at the office? Can I bring a friend? She's real cute too and hot to trot. A threesome can be fun too, no? Sure... Absolutely delicious. We'll pick you up at seven at your office. Perfect. Well, see you tomorrow. I'll be thinking of you... It's in the bag! Wasn't I good? What was that about two of you? So as not to freak out the first time. And he sounds nice. Got everything, girls? What's with the travel bag? For appearances. Is this for the night or for life? It's just my toiletry case. I feel like a divorcê using his visiting rights. I'm just going to the store. He's coming with us? Just for drinks. We said threesome, not foursome. But he's bringing champagne. Why say no? Screw the champagne! Anyway, I don't drink alcohol. Who says we can't start with four, and end with three? The point is to get there. Sit up front, Patricia? Plenty of people have seen us. It's a bust! Gotta pull the plug! Stop here. I have to call. Call from the house. I prefer a booth. A Jaguar! Get down! It's them. Shit, 47 minutes late! You've really got protection. I even installed a camera. How about a kiss in closeup? Too bad! The bathroom? Door after the bedroom. No, I just got in this second. We're cooked! His friend's on his way. And we were seen everywhere. Count me out! That's no reason to act stupid. But this is acting stupid, can't you see? Flush the toilet! Hey, girls. It doesn't work. It doesn't flush. It was working. No big deal. Got a cigarette? I only smoke menthols. Have any Kools? None in stock. I'll go buy some. Nothing's open now! The Drugstore's not far away. Antoine's on his way. He has some. Not Kools. I'll drive over and get some. What's with her? - It's no good! - What? There are cameras and his pal's coming. I'll fetch Patricia. No, don't... Wait... - Found your Kools? - No, I didn't! I'm fed up! Some bitch got nasty and called me a whore. I've had it! I'm splitting! What's with her? She sick or what? You're leaving too? You're all nuts! I can't leave her! Is this a hustle or something? I just can't let my friend go like that. Look, I'll get her and I'll be right back. What would you have done about the camera? Weren't you there once? There wasn't a camera then. And the door? Are you jiving me? I didn't notice. It can happen. No, it can't. Or stay a salesgirl! Salesgirl-model! Anyway, his pal was coming. It was bad from the start. I told you not to go together. The idea was to take turns. What's the point of taking turns between just two of us! You'd need several girls for it to work. How would we split the loot? 10 shares? Why not 20! We'd be at it all winter. I'm not spending my winter doing this! Next time, Patricia goes, as we planned. But she's chickening out! That's right. My mom was real strict on food. Same with my sister. She couldn't stand seeing her eat junk like cream tarts. All the fattening things. She's right. My mom's got a great figure for 40. She still attracts the guys. A diet's good when you're a kid. Makes it easier later. You can end up with an anorexic child. This dieting obsession is dangerous. Did you see that TV show? My mom's not obsessed. She just wants us to have good eating habits. I'll do the same. What you have to give your kids is love. But clean living counts too. They'll get worked up. We shouldn't have left them together. Want me to get Patricia so you can fuck her? Cut the crap! If she was keen on me, she wouldn't chicken out. No relation. If she does, we go with Nat. Like I said. Nat won't chicken out. I'm not so sure. Nat loves you. Wouldn't be them... It's them. I see Nat. He may be trying to park. Shit, 52 minutes late! He's got a parking lot. We didn't expect that! And we don't have the door code! Aren't you on the river? Sure, but there's a garage too. Even here, it's not safe. Never fear, my pet. There's a lift to the 7th floor, and seventh heaven. You're going to soar, honey. That prick better keep his paws off Nathalie. But she can handle herself. I forgot my Kools. I forgot my cigarettes. Got any Kools? Here's a good one... Guy says to his shrink: "I had dinner with mama like I've done for 40 years now. "She said: Pass the salt, and I said: Up yours! "Progress, huh, Doc?" That's a great one! Don't find that funny? Another code? I'm heavily coded. Heard the baby joke? Me neither! Never misses! Mr and Mrs Dewing have a son... Howie. Howie Dewing. Say, you don't look like a Kool smoker... Mr and Mrs Kool have a son... Anything can wedge a door... Gotta find the "anything". This would have done it. You've got nothing upstairs. You're a case. Gimme your address book. We're not gonna keep moldering in the car! The lawyer. His profile... I told you: He's loaded and has tons of show biz contacts. That's not enough. We need specifics. Cut the shit! And this dentist... Right up your alley. A dentist. Find out what he makes, his car, if he has a safe... Specifics! Quit being useless. - Where you going? - To my mom's. - You dumping us? - Dunno! Relax, she'll be back! How would you know? If I had your pretty face, she'd come running back. And you'd handle it better? Probably. You can't cruise a chick and you're giving advice! I must be dreaming! But Marie-Paule loved me. So why'd she dump you? Dunno. Said I frightened her. You dummy... Mom? Mimi, what is it? Mommy isn't home yet? Want some Nutella? There's a beast under my bed. There's no beast. What d'you want? I'll be right down. Going away? I'll be back. My boyfriend's downstairs. Don't leave me. Go to bed. There's no beast. Really. You'll come back? Promise. And I'll sleep in your bed. You'd like that? So get right to bed. I'll wait here. If you want. We have to talk. Quit treating me like a moron. I'm sorry. I was all wired. We'll be better off talking in the car. My kid sister's waiting. Just a little talk, no? Not for long... Leave us alone. It's freezing. Don't worry. Antoine, the lawyer... I won't blow it. Is this shark skin? Looks like it. Too big on me, but classy. Think it's off the shark in "Jaws"? They look better on you. But maybe you shouldn't have paid by check. Why not? It'll bounce. Don't worry. I'll be on top of it. I feel it. Depressing... Not bad... Can I have this one? Hold on. Your friends are here. Coming. How do I look? Real pretty. Can I have... Keep them all... The pink, blue, green, brown, yellow... Hand me the case. Whose is all that? Ours. Just to scare them. Go over it again? - No need. - You sure? Sure, I'm sure. Stash the radio. You're gorgeous. Go on. You're wearing my scarf? For good luck. This is it. There's a door opposite. Maybe he's on the ground floor. That you, baby? I'm coming. Close the door behind you. Sit down. I'm just re-reading my chapter. - Writing a book? - A novel. Really? I'll let you read it. A love story. Like love stories? Sure, but in movies. Maybe it'll become a movie. With a role for you... That's what they all say... Don't want to act? Sure, I do. And maybe sing, too. You like love stories in real life, too? Sure. Take that lipstick off. You don't like it? It's not your style. My friends will be waiting. I'll go and change quick. It's okay. He's alone. - You went out? - I lost my ring. We have to go. I'd like a drink first. Have any orange juice? I was really thirsty. Better this way? I like your place. Why don't you cancel? Rather stay in? We're much better here. I'm always going out. I'd like a cozy evening. Freeze! On the couch! The chick too! You sent my kid brother to jail! We want his file and cash to spring him! It couldn't have been me! I'm not a criminal lawyer. But I can help you... Lie down! Over here, bitch! You know them? Shut up! Tie the bimbo up. Your hands... Where's your money? In my jacket, on the chair. Is this all? This is all you got? What are you going to do? Shut your trap! Got a safe here, cocksucker? Fuck! Nothing! The party's over! Where's the safe? I told you, I don't have one! I'm a small-time lawyer. Sure, below poverty level! Don't fuck us around! Don't fuck with us! I'm telling you... Want your face smashed in? Take the carpets and paintings. I'll write you a check. You take us for morons? We want cash! Tell them or they'll go crazy. I haven't any! Maybe your bitch knows. Deal with him. Shut the door! Maybe there's no safe. Don't give us the evil eye! Where's his bedroom? I don't know. There's a staircase. Under the mattress. Where the fuck is his bread? Nothing but books! What's going on? It's nothing. He's making him talk. Stay here. He won't talk. These things are stifling! You okay? Tell us where the safe is. I already snuffed your friend Nathalie, so... Tie him up again. What's going on? We fucked up. We said we killed you. So? So, now we have to kill him or he'll talk. I don't get it. We have to kill him. If he sees you again, he'll know. Go on. We've got no choice. I only have Kools... The club broke. Fuck, what'd you do to him? Finish him off. That's it... - Let's head for "Niels". - Why? We need an alibi. - My jean's are bloody. - So what? It's dark there. He wore a wig? - How much was in his wallet? - 2400 francs. After all that! Next time we better score! But Bruno can't hit me. So this kid runs the Porsche his dad gave him into a tree. Car's totalled, kid's bloodied... Get the picture? And the kid starts to yell: "Mom, my Porsche!" His mom, unhurt, says: "Stop bawling about the car. Your arm's severed!" So the kid starts to howl: "Mom, my Rolex!" Why his Rolex? You gotta spell it out for her. Let's alley-oop! This is for the waiter. - We split it. - It's on us. One for the road on me? No, the kid's worn out. We've been here for ages. Next time, then. How's your dad? He's gonna make it. What happened? I was working on the Champs-Elysêes. We turned away some kids. They came back... 15 of 'em, with baseball bats, razors and shit... One of my pals is in the hospital. The motherfuckers! Here. For your pal. Thanks, guys. Have a nice night. Gorgeous, as usual. It's part of the job. Tell Bruno to get his jeans out of the bidet. He's asleep. Lay off him! So I can't wash up? Use the fucking shower. He won't live with us in the States! Okay. Just gimme a break! His pants make me puke with all that blood! Let us sleep! They gotta soak. Want to take 'em to a dry cleaner? I'm broke. Not even a metro ticket. Look in my jacket. 100 francs! Is this all that's left? At your age, my mom lived on that for a week. 'Bye, Fishy. Only you understand me. Going to work? Yes. Starting today, it's bread and potatoes. What was the budget of "Terminator 2"? $40 million... - What'd your mom give you? - Peanuts. - How much? - 500 francs. That won't get us far! They fucking think by cutting me off, I'd find a job! As if it was easy. Don't make me laugh. Did you find a job? Can't you get a birthday advance? Sure thing... Like three tickets for the States. Forget it! We gotta find the cash ourselves, and fast! Careful! Sorry, I didn't mean to. Nat was attached to that bowl. It was from her Dad. She's gonna visit him at Christmas. Not till we hit the jackpot, she's not. You told her? No need. She's not that dumb. She knows we can't keep fucking around. She'll see her dad when we hit paydirt. Maybe tomorrow. Everyone has a lucky star. Dunno. I never had one. Since you met me, you do. And it'll stay that way. Sure hope so. You're no good, cunt. Shit! My cap! And the bastard hurt me! We now know Mr Jousse had a date that night. Know the girl? Not really. Antoine had plenty of dates. A real playboy. That may have been the problem. But why? Everyone liked Antoine. He was kind, friendly, generous. He was a real winner. He won the gold medal this time. So, heartbreaker... we give false numbers? I'm glad to see you. Lemme finish the headline. The best is at the end. "Police think the killer(s) Sought a file, "which would explain the tortures." - Great, no? - How's that for being off-base! Jeez, are the cops ever dumb! Hi, fellas! Hi, cutie! I brought drinks. That's so sweet. I try my best. You read the papers now? A must for future entrepreneurs. Okay, I get it. What was so funny? Funny? When? Before, when I came in. - You wouldn't get it. - Try me. You wouldn't get this joke. You never do. She'll beat me up! So tell me. First, did you find a guy? Hold on. I've been on my feet for eight hours. It just never let up. Under my management, your salesgirls'll get a break. And my office will have a big, cushy leather sofa, plus a mini-bar stocked with champagne, Coke, fruit juice and all. The great yuppie dream! Oh... and caviar too. Who offers you caviar? Loads of guys. That's gross! I'll call Patricia. And you find someone. Someone worthwhile. Why not Michel, the one who got away last time? It's him we should get. Why's he calling Patricia? For the next job, I think. The store's been hopping since the sale started. Did you rip a page out of my encyclopedia? Still have it? I threw it out. One page isn't so bad. It was about sea lions. Will you tell Eric? You're sweet. If you had the looks, maybe I'd've been with you. Her line's always busy. She won't do it. She freaked out last time. And she's super-Catholic. She doesn't look it, but she is. A guy with three cars, and houses in St Tropez and Megêve - how's that grab you? May I speak to Alain, please? Oh, it's you. It's Nathalie. You free tonight? You made your call? - Did you order? - Yes. Two salads. Your father sent a ticket for Christmas. A round trip by plane? Is it first class? Let go! I won't eat it. Tourist class. There may not be first class on short flights. Departure: 20 Dec. Return, the 30th. 10 days! Will you last without Eric? We're not married! Things okay between you? No hitches? No. I mean, there are no hitches. Good. Hold on to him. He's better than what you used to bring home. You really like Eric. I do like him. I like well-bred boys. And he's nice. Plus handsome. Which doesn't hurt. Henri... You're not forgetting us? After Christmas, Eric and I may go to the U.S. He wants to go into pret-à-porter there. So his father's... No, he wants to go it alone. He's fed up with being his daddy's boy. Sounds nice. But without capital... Why d'you always criticize what I say? I never criticize. Yes, you do. It's always: "It'll never work!" And I told you ham. You know I hate chicken! You don't wanna go? It's not that. He's ashamed to take me to his folks for dinner? I don't think so. So why doesn't he take me? He could've left you the car. You'd pick us up and drop me off at the guy's place, instead of going by metro. He knows I hate going to a date by metro. Especially at night. It's full of junkies and it's yucky. You're safe with me. I introduced Eric to my mom. I didn't hide him. I hope tonight's the night. What'll you do to him? Dunno. Killing is easy. It happens fast. Anybody can do it. Which house? There. Number 19. She's been up there long? No, 10 minutes. Family dinner tonight. Not the best timing! Why the phony number? Because of my mom. And my jealous boyfriend. When I met you, I gave you 3 exclamation points! Three? Top score. Let me see! Cêcile: 2. Marie-Sophie: 1... Lara: 3... Who's Lara? She doesn't count. Let's go. Where to? The Tour d'Argent. A friend's throwing a birthday party... You didn't tell me. It's a surprise. You've never been there. Finish your orange juice and let's go. I'm not thirsty. Want my real number? But hurry! You have a pen? It's a Parker! Shall we go? It's the latch! Must be my old neighbor. She gets confused. I once found her in my kitchen opening a can of ravioli. My sweetie got scared. Cut it out, Eric! You want to make me sick? You didn't open! I did. But I forgot about the thingummijig! Shouldn't have! I'm going to my Mom's. You're staying here! Murderer! Stop it, Eric! You heard the bitch? Calm down! Look what he did to me! It's okay. It's okay. I'll make you some coffee. Drink this. Why'd you slap her? I didn't. I smacked her. When's that dough coming in? I apologize for what I said. I never hit a woman. My father never hit my mother. I know. Wanna hear that joke again? I sure would. This mama's boy wrecks a Maserati his dad gave him. He's lying in the road, and he yells, "My Maserati!" Your pants have been soaking for four days now! The blood won't come out. If you muck up another pair tonight, I don't want 'em in the tub. Going like that? Wait... I've got my anklets too. What's with the tights? Not tights, leggings. What's wrong with them? The color? Everything's showing! Look at her! Look at him! He's jealous! Time to go. You won't see the end of the movie. If he touches you... He's getting all worked up! He'd better not touch you! Get there on time, then! Skip the hoods. They're stifling. No one'll see us. Your tree's super! You have kids? A five-year old boy. He spends holidays with me. He loves that. So do I. Are all these presents for him? Hardly. There are things for family and friends, too. Play with this. Press the button. Where do I point it? I'll get your orange juice. It's fabulous! Good? The salmon is. Not better like this? Sure. Easy now. I'd feel better in the bedroom, I think. At your command! - How about a movie? - Clips. Checking the time? There's no hurry, sweets. I hope you're not the kind who clocks everything, for your own Guinness Book of Records. What's the matter? Afraid I'll rape you? I just want a peek. I don't like to rush things. Gotcha, bitch! Eric! You here? Don't move! I'm her man! Tie him up. Turn around. Move and I shoot! Tie him up! Turn over. I can't manage. I know how to do it! Get her out. I'll see to her later. What's the idea, stupid? Untie me. Come on! There! I didn't hit you this time. You little cunt! You fake beggar! What was that? I never swallowed your abandoned baby crap! Well, I did sleep under the stairs. And my mother... She took off, understand? Yeah, but the orphanage? Yeah, nice doggie, go help your master. Don't just stand there! Search the place. There's nothing here. Call this nothing? Does it say "thick" here? Go on! Why'd it stop ringing? It's the police. They're checking on me. Checking on you? What's this shit? I asked for protection against someone. I know the commissioner. He calls every 3 hours... If I don't call back... You really won't find anything. I'm deep in debt. I bought everything on credit, or on company checks. And the firm's going bust. And your flat? I owe three month's back rent. They can't evict you in winter with a kid. And I never touched your girl. Oh, no? What were you doing in the sack? We were watching TV. Don't bullshit me! I'm not so dumb! You're not dumb. You don't understand. I might get nasty. You're Jewish... Uh, yeah... I knew it. I knew we had something in common. You won't kill a brother. Jews aren't murderers. They can be crooks, thieves, yes, but murderers, never. You're not the same as the ones who profane cemeteries. You're not pals with skinheads. Me, with skinheads? I said you're not pals! I'm a father. I have a son. He's five. He's got eyes like yours. His photo's in the living room. Maybe we're related, who knows? Can I have something to drink? Can't find the safe. - Get him some water. - Who for? Him! Move it! Want some? Thanks, I'm not hungry. They having a heart-to-heart talk? Free me and take the girl. I won't tell anyone. I swear. Why not run him a bath, too? He's throwing us off. Wait in the car. What? Go wait in the car. It's open. It's just up the street. Where are your hoods? It's okay! Fuck it! Do like me... Not like that, like this... Perez... It's the police. What's taking them? I can't do it. It's your turn. This'll cover the noise. Go on, kid. What's taking you? Don't try to con me again. Go ahead. Shoot. It's easy to shoot a man who's tied hand and foot. I should be scared, not you. I'm not scared. I think you are. You know what you're in for. Shoot and you screw up your life. A dumb thing at your age. You can choose. You gonna shut up? If I die, my mom'll cry for me. But yours will never get over it. I just can't... I can't do it. Not with a gun. Me neither. We have to. Cover his eyes and gag him so he doesn't scream. I'm at my mom's. Take the small ones. The cunt smeared my windshield! Shit, my keys! I can't find them! I almost shot myself! Fucking cartridge! They could trace the gun. Tons of guys get caught like that. See it? How can we get caught if you didn't use the gun? What're you going on about? Mr Know-It-AII! Ever use a gun? Hold anyone up? I can't believe this! Here it is! Found your keys? Should I drive? You look out of it. I'm okay! What is it? Nothing. I had a fight with Eric. No answer. What do we do? Get some sleep. And the split? Tomorrow. What's all this? Why'd you skip out on us? I got sick of waiting. Drive me to work? You mucked your jeans again. For every 100000 CD's sold at 100 francs, the guy gets 50%. They don't all cost 100. Some sell for 120, 130, up to 170. I'm simplifying to figure out what he can make. Out of his 11 million, he pays salaries, advertising... and the packaging. The record houses pay those, doofus. - Where you going? - I'm walking. It stinks in here. All these fuckups are getting to her. It wears you out. Started without me? Relax. You'll get your share. Like this? I'll put it on. Can I have the lighter? Thanks. The chicks are gonna really fall for this. Nice pens! They're Duponts. Pick one. Want the guarantees with 'em? What class. Let's see? Cartier. He didn't stint on presents. Here, sweets. A ring. From Cartier's, too. A bit big, but pretty. Bruno, count the bills. Doesn't come to much. 6000. Exactly. Give! That's 2000 apiece. Lucky for us, it was Christmas. I know. I don't get it! These guys never have safes! It's unreal! - Not taking it? - It pinches. Too bad. It's a Hermês. Well, there's nothing for me. Maybe the belt. I doubt it. He would've put my name on the wrapping. Marie-Paule can have it. What'd you do to him? I was waiting for hours. What'd you expect us to do? I have to see you. It's really really important. I don't believe it. Then what about those jeans in the bidet? But... they couldn't have! I swear! - You saw it? - No, but they told me. They've completely flipped out. They stole this necklace off the guy. What? Move it! Dinner's nearly ready. Coming. Get a move on. I can't tell you how spooked I am. - Did you tell your mom? - Are you nuts? You better not be putting me on! Would I make up something like this? Who knows, with you? Thanks a lot. So why do you stay with him? I've got no choice. Don't let on that I told you or they'll kill me. Switch! A bakery chain wouldn't be a bad idea either. You made the cake? Switch. I can't stand old fogeys! - Why not? - I just don't. Bruno worked for a classy caterer. Not all that classy. Well, almost. Shit! I wouldn't mind doing that chick. Thanks a lot! - What's wrong, fats? - Don't call me that! - See what you did! - You asked for it. You're covered in chocolate. I hate you. He was kidding around. Not with that! And you go wash your jeans! You make me sick, all of you! Don't get mad, sweets! Leave me alone! I'm going to bed. Coming, Karine? - She's sleeping with you? - Well, not with Bruno? His pal's so sexy I'm supposed to supply him with girls. See? You can't knock his pal. - Bitch! - Not for long, maybe. - Meaning what? - You may go to America alone. You can't walk out on us now. Who do you take me for? Anyway, I didn't believe you. Yes, you did. I played along. I know you well enough. But suppose I'd gone to the cops! They'd have taken you for a nut. But suppose one of them had been burgled and really killed. See the mess? And "suppose" I'm the Pope! Popesse. There is none! But it's a word, I think. Unbelievable! - Where you going? - For cigarettes. What're you doing? Any cigarettes left? Let's make up. Sure, but... Promise. No more chocolate in the face. Remember to call that guy tomorrow... The one with the safe. You won't forget? 'Cause I'd really like a vacation. Where? Zermatt, with my folks. Asleep already? I have an audition at 9. Have to be in shape. You might've told me! They only want girls with accents. It's never me they want. I like the fabric. Nice, but expensive. He jacked up the prices. They all want discounts. Do the price tags. Okay. Two gentlemen to see you. From the police. Don't worry. It's just for some information. They're very polite. Leave the jacket. But I like it. You wanted to see me? It's just for some information for a case we're on. It won't take long. You'll get her right back. I sure hope so. - Where we going? - Quai des Orfêvres. Our office. But not for long. Have you got an arrest warrant? This isn't an American TV movie. Can I wear the jacket? No, leave it. But I'll be right back. And it'll still be here. Go on, now... I'll get my jacket. See you later. Want some gum? No siren? With the siren, we could pass everybody. The ring too? I want it back. Sort of cramped here. I need your name, age, your parents' names, home address, work address... You have it! True. But we're very fussy here. It all goes into the report. So... Nathalie Magnan, right? Can I smoke? Date and place of birth. September 2, '76. 18 years old. Paris 12. - Parents... - Odile and Jacques Magnan. Address... My mother's? Have another one? I live at my boyfriend's too. My mom rented it to me. Address? 5 rue des Tilleuls. In Neuilly. Well, Neuilly-Levallois. Levallois. It's almost Neuilly! Schooling? - What grade? - Baccalaureat. Which section? I failed the exam. Neuilly, almost. Bac, not quite. Boyfriend, sometimes. Who are you exactly? Like anybody else. Get her out of my sight and search her. They said it was just for questions. Are you pregnant? Yes. I'm due in April. It's your first? No, I have a 5-year-old boy. Rêgis. Is it a girl or a boy? A girl. That's nice. But I'd hate to be pregnant around here. Your panties too. Big deal. I'm no prude. I didn't see him that night. You were where? At the movies. The theater? The movie? The showing? On the Champs. The movie? I don't remember. Try! You weren't alone. Who were you with? - A girlfriend. - Not your fellow? Sure, right, with him. So you stood Jousse up. - I didn't. - But you had a date. You didn't see him? I told you 10 times I didn't see him! Where'd you get this? It's mine. A present. - Who from? - My boyfriend. When did he give it to you? Saturday. It was on Saturday. Night of the murder. What murder? I keep telling you I don't get any of this! No? You don't get it? Think we're gonna keep swallowing your nonsense? Cut the crap right now! Look at me! In the eyes. In the eyes, I said! Get this into your thick skull! This isn't about hustling or robbery. It's about murders! And murders you don't see in any horror movie. I've got photos of your victims' bodies. Your victims. Want to see them? Antoine Jousse's head smashed open, in a pool of blood... Or Alain Perez stabbed with a letter-opener. 12 stab wounds! Because a letter-opener isn't sharp enough. But first, you tortured them, slowly... You heard them screaming. So, want to see the photos? They're only photos. Go on... I think you didn't see the bodies, or you wouldn't have continued. And you were going to continue. She wants to see you alone. I was there, but I didn't do anything. It was them... Freeze! Oh, shit! Got 'em. He pissed in his pants! Who picked them? Not me. But you knew them. You flirted, went home with them, slept with them. I never slept with them! They had no luck at all! Take a look. Call HQ for a photographer. And all those ads for detergents! Read it over and sign on the bottom of each page. Is this a Mont-Blanc? Yes, it's a Mont-Blanc. Now that I've said everything, you'll let me go by Christmas? I have to visit my dad at Christmas.
