- You pledged safe passage by wampum belt. You pledged safe passage upon our surrender! - You... Old Briton, my brother, pledged devotion to father which he breaks by traitorous acts with the British! Ugh! - Father starves our people and steals our land with liquor and trifles. He is no father. And you half breed, are no true brother of our cause! - This is not the way of my people nor the King of France. - It is the way of the Ottawa, we'll make our purpose here, like thunder. - And the two other traders, Burney and McBryer. Where be they now? - The Miami have hid them. - Well, then I want them both to Detroit. Unharmed. That'll be all, Ensign. - In the Parlor, Major. - Madam Fairfax. - I do not, as I've insisted on numerous occasions, reply to Madam or any other form of mummery in your presence. To you, my dear boy, I am simply Sally. Might that be? - 'Tis, indeed. A good fellow in Alexandria did supply it. - 'Tis French. - Aye. It's origin, Ma... Sally. - Well, I speak not a word of French. - Louis the Beloved, my darling... George. - William. - ...would have the whole of the Virginia gentry, whether noble or landed, croaking out French if these sensational stories of his encroachments and hostilities in the Ohio Valley as published in the Gazette, be certified. - How do you mean, dear nephew? - Dear uncle, father. How was the hunt? - That the stories published in the Gazette be sensational, how do you mean, sir? - I believe the boy to mean- - Let him speak his mind, William. - I will show you. "From Bristol. "A one Mrs. Norman found murdered in her own Huckster shop, “in a very dismal manner.” "She, having several marks of violence about her head, “a large quantity of blood was issued." Now the owner of the Gazette routinely prints forlorn appeals for old shirts, caps and handkerchiefs in order to supply it's paper mill. - What are you saying, son? - What I am saying is that the very estate of such an enterprise as printed news demands a measure of sensationalism for it's very survival and I'm merely suggesting that we consider that fact before England finds itself in another bloody war with France. - A fine point, George William. A fine point, indeed. - Thank you, sir. - Young Washington. What say you in response to my nephew's claim that the stories published in the Gazette be sensational and uncertified. - 'Twas not a claim, dear uncle. - The boy was merely suggesting- - I'm aware, William of the boy's suggestion, may also hear what young Washington would suggest as well. - I'd say whether sensational or no, such reports should be certified without delay, since it is the divine right of the Crown to the Ohio Valley that is in question. - You will dine with us tonight, Major. - It would be an honor, sir. - Seems the boy has rightly answered. - Afterward, I shall write the letter you requested to Governor Dinwiddie recommending your commission to carry the Crown's remonstrance to the French Commandant at Fort Duquesne demanding immediate cessation of all hostilities and encroachments in the Ohio Valley. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. - Now, what have you? - Le Royale, sir. 'Tis to be the first dance at the Governor's Ball of the new year. - Ah, a French Minuet. Wonderful. You must learn it, at once. - I can't simply just instruct without mastery of the language. - Mm. My nephew was taught parle Francais at Appleby. They are still teaching it at the school, are they not? - They are. - Very well, then, William shall translate and Abraham will offer a lively beat. - Excellent. - Well, then, there it is. - No one has journeyed beyond Logstown with reports, sensational or no, of French and Savage butchery at Pickawillany. And you would send a mere boy into the midst of it. - Not I, William, Governor Dinwiddie shall send the laddie on behalf of His Majesty. - Oh, shall he do so as the Governor of Virginia or as stockholder in the Ohio Company? - Be it of any consequence, dear cousin, if the French be successful in their efforts to drive the English from these Tidewaters? - Be it of any consequence... if the boy dies in the wilderness? - 'Tis mesure trois quarts. It's a three quarters measure in a zed figure and you may circle more than once while presenting hands. Now, remember, George, that the graceful motion of the arms, and the giving of the hand, and all material parts of a gentleman's dancing of the utmost importance, a man of fashion. Now, let us begin. What you'll be doing, is you’ll be waiting for the count down and then you'll be coming together. - I have had some instruction in the Minuet. - Right. Abraham. - Good morn', Major Washington. - Good morn'. 'Tis there be the letter of Lordship to Governor Dinwiddie? - 'Tis. His Lordship spotted the red fox this morn', he be on the chase with the colonel. - And, what of Miss... - Sally? Asleepin', I expect. - Aye. 'Tis early. - It is. His Lordship said you are to insist that the Governor send you with a letter addressing Mister Christopher Gist of Will's Creek orderin' him to accompany you on the journey. Mr. Gist is from the Ohio Company. He has surveyed the winter lands beyond Logstown. - I shall so inform the Governor but I need only a translator. - His Lordship is head bullied on the matter. Mr. Gist is accompanying you. - Very well, then. - Your mother, sir. - What about my mother? - His Lordship will have you attend to your mother at Ferry Farm with mindful and warm goodbyes before proceeding on. - Be that the speech of Lord Fairfax, or that of yours, Abraham? - You buried a brother, sir. But she buried a son. Say your goodbyes, Major. - Gabriel, I want those stacks in the wagon. Rows straight. See if you can put the corn in the cabbage patch. - Now, what is this conceit? - 'Tis yonder. - Well, well, this is most curious. A word has been inscribed in our cabbage patch. - Aye. - And that word is... - George. - Aye, George. But how has this occurred? Why has the earth written the name of my son? This must be the work of chance. - I never saw little plants grow up so as to make one single letter. How then could they grow to make the whole of my name so exactly. - Indeed. This was not done by chance, by my own hand. - For what purpose? - Do you see the world in which your name has now sprung forth? The sky, blue and boundless. The river, bubbling up as it rushes forward. The birds of the air, and all living things. It's amazing. Don't you think, George? Some would have you to believe today that all of this is the work of chance and not that of Divine Providence, a loving creator who has promised never to leave nor forsake us, who will forever be by your side as I am today, George. Do you understand? I must be back to work. Day’s end draws near. - And work remains. - Yes, work remains. Yet, I do so enjoy this wonderful view. Shall I tarry longer? - Aye. - Then I shall. And I shall give you my time piece so that I may not be vexed by its ticking. - You have been commissioned by the Governor of Virginia. - I read your letter. - Who was acting by order of the Crown of whom ye be a subject. - My son lies sick at the mouth of the Conegocheague, 'tis him I shall attend. Be it so I fall not out of favor with the Crown, I pray ye relieve me of this undertaking so I may go to my own with no thought. - I shall not relieve you. Go and risk the consequence of it. - My wife will provide stew meat, a place for you to rest before you set out. Have a good evening, sir. - [Washington] Ma'am. - Come inside, girls. - Thank you. - Ye eat like a boy. - I shall tell Governor Dinwiddie the circumstances surrounding your husband's insubordination. Rest assured he will justly weigh- - Justly weigh? - [Washington] Aye. - Ye know not the man. - Pray pardon? - The governor possesses no ableness to justly weigh a matter when his own enrichment be in question. - 'Tis the divine right of the Crown in question, Misses Gist. - Ye know not the Crown as well, Major Washington. Nor your own self, I suspect. - What say you, Madam? - Ye eat and ye think like a boy. - Is this the proper time for this discussion? - I'm afraid the children posses more discernment than you, Mr. Washington. - I am a commissioned officer and the King's emissary. - Ye are inexperienced in the ways of government. And Dinwiddie is a brutish wretch to send you on this death trip... with my husband. I'll make ready your room. - You're quite tall for a boy, Mr. Washington. - Beth, it's Major Washington. - And ye are both quite smart for such young girls. - "31st of October, 1753. "I was commissioned by the Governor of Virginia "to deliver a letter to the French Forces on the Ohio." - Why stand ye there, Chris? 'Tis two days journey to the Conegocheague. Why ye stand there? - I wrote a letter and sent medicine with a messenger. - Shall our son face his mortality in the company of a hired man instead of his own father who seems to choose the Crown over everything else? - He shall recover, Sarah. Ye shall see him soon. - What if he doesn't? What if he die out there all alone without any care from his family? - Sarah, I am confident he shall recover. - Oh, Chris. Here. Offer your new companion a glass. Could be his last. - 'Tis safe. She'd be gone to bed. - [Washington] Aye. - Can you speak French, Major? - Nay. - Aye, 'twas your brother attended Appleby? You were schooled at home. Says, "We, French, shall not be departin' the Ohio Valley "any time soon. "We have the forts and the Ottawa Nation to back it up." What'd ye have? - The Iroquois. The Iroquois still stand with the Crown. - Do they now? - You, yourself, negotiated the treaty at Logstown and- - Aye. I committed the Crown and the Ohio Company, as I were instructed to, to build a fort on the Monongahela to protect the Indian allies and for my efforts I was promised land. Neither of which has King George honored. The Iroquois may still stand with the Crown but it by the cause of the Half King's lust of revenge for the Ottawa killing and eating his daddy. - The Plate. Where was it found? - Pickawillany. Or what be left of it. Trader, by the name of Burney, took it up out of the ash, delivered it to me with a story that the Ottawa, under French command, raided the village, killing men, women and children then doin' the same to the Village Chief. - Memeskia? - He was a good friend, Memeskia, the Old Briton, put his trust in the Crown. Kept assurin' him the Fort would be built and his people would be safe in the land. They butchered him in front of his wife and children so that no Provincial nor Indian, not loyal to French, would dare venture to go where you and the Governor would have us go. - I suggest you get some sleep, Major. It'll be first light, sir. - Aye. Good eve', Mr. Gist. - Ever fire that musket at a living being, upright, not scuttling in the dust, Major? - Nay, Mr. Gist, was my brother who taught me to fire. And he also taught me to stay my hand in the absence of reason and authority. - Hm. Well your brother be not here, Major, be just the two of us. And I know from having trekked through it, there'd be an absence of reason where we be heading. - [Washington] “The cold increased very fast “and the roads we're becoming worse by a deep snow. “Therefore, we determined to continue our journey on foot.” More provision, sir. You may take a rest when you finish with your stories, Major. I'll keep watch. - What do you think about eternity, Mr. Gist? - Well, Major, currently I'm in the employee of avoiding eternity from the both of us. As long as I see those who are mine that I love. That should be enough. - Do you fear the Allegheny more, or Sarah? - Oh. Well, if we make it not across the Allegheny, her anger will follow me into your eternity, sir, that I promise you. - [Washington] “We met up with the Half King “and his men at Logstown and made an alliance. “They joined our group. “We all arrived at Fort LeBeouf, December 12th, 1753. “While we awaited to visit the Commandant “about the letter from Governor Dinwiddie, “I had the opportunity to make observations about the Fort. “According to my best judgment, “there are approximately 100 soldiers. “The bastions are made of piles driven into the ground “and about 12 feet above, and sharp at the top.” - I've assessed the Fort and made note. There are about 100 men on... What say you, Mr. Gist? - Half King is inside with Captain La Force. We cannot put our hopes in these Iroquois. They've been good to us, but they can be swayed by what is best for their survival. - My hope is not in any man, Mr. Gist, but in the Divine. And I pray that the Half Kings not succumb to their flattery nor their fine speech, but he assured me that we ought not be concerned, that he knew the French all too well. - They have managed to keep us here far longer than we ought, Major. We cannot predict what these Indians will or will not bow to. Must stay sharp. - I believe we are being invited to sup, Major. - Very well. - May I ask when Commandant Legardeur will arrive? - The Commandant has other demanding priorities, Major. Ye' do not think that you are the only one who vies for his attention? But, I am certain that he will be back soon. - I should think the highest priority should be placed on French and British relations. - Are you not enjoying our hospitality, Major? Here, have some more of our finest French wine. - We are obliged by your hospitality. But we are eager to see the Commandant so we may be on way. - You know, your Indian companions, they love our fine wine, as well as our exquisite gifts. - Aye. I'm quite certain, they do. - By whose authority and instruction do the French Commander-General march his troops from Canada and invade Virginia territory? - Ye dare ask me this, when your English subjects are on French territory. - They are only there to trade, Captain. - No. No Englishman has the right to trade on French claimed lands. - He speaks in English now. - The British have made claim to this land. And I demand a response to Governor Dinwiddie's letter. - You are in no position to demand anything, Major Washington! - Gentlemen, please, we are only here to deliver a message, not start a war. Major. - Major Washington, did you not know that La Sol made the discovery of this land 60 years ago, long before English eyes were even upon it? - What did they say, Mr. Gist? - I am not certain, but I would venture to say they are not applauding our charm and wit. Major, hold your anger. - I have never laid eyes on such a fruitless endeavor. I shall take my leave, gentlemen. - No, Major, you shall wait for the Commandant. - We have waited far too long. - Gentleman, forgive my tardiness. I have much business to conduct in continuing the affairs of the Fort. - Good eve, Commandant. - Sir, we are glad you could join us. - We also have much business to attend to, which brings us to the letter of remonstrance from Governor Dinwiddie. Have you a reply for us? - It must have been a treacherous journey to come here in the dead of winter. - Aye. And I fear it will be much worse going back. - Commandant, we have been here long enough, please. - I have reviewed the letter and I find it to be quite bold, considering the French have already claimed this land. Major Washington, it is our absolute design to take possession of the Ohio Valley. Adieu. - [Washington] “I tied myself up in a match coat “and with my pack containing the letter of remonstrance, “provisions and a gun, “set out with Mr. Gist, “accompanied by an Indian guide.” - The guide hastens. - Do you see him, Major? Is he before us? - Nay, he has quickened. Are we nigh? - Two whoops. He made a claim of two whoops. You be watchful, Major, I trust him not. - Are there others? - We're in Ottawa nation. - We have no writ of execution, Mr. Gist. We shall return to Williamsburg to put the Indian to custody. - Nay, this savage will not take breath a moment longer, Major. Stand aside. - You will put away your sidearm at once sir, or you will answer for mutinous acts. Mr. Gist! - Ah! This fell beast is a sweet French monger. - Halt, I said! - I now recall you ferreting about Fort Le Boeuf. - Halt at once, Mr. Gist. - He led us into Ottawa territory to have us murdered by his butchering lot. They would have your precious governor's letter and our pitiful scalps if he had not lost the trail in this mist. Two whoops to the cabin, you say... And I suppose you got lost and fired your weapon without thought. We have neither the resource nor fortitude to take custody of this savage. And since you will not let me kill him, we must get him away and travel all night to the Allegheny River and hope it is froze hard to cross. - Be gone, treacherous fox. - We are not only emissaries of the Crown here, Mr. Gist, but ambassadors of the Divine. Our every step will speak beyond this snowy hill. - That Indian will find his brothers and they will hunt us down. Our every step on this snowy hill will betray us. We must hurry now. - Water, Major. - Good. Ah, let's not tarry long. - Shall I make note of the guide's treason? I shall make note. Are they Ottawa, Gist? - Aye. -Tis’t the guide and his brothers. - [Mr. Gist] Aye. We are in the midst of scalpers. If it come to a fight, you take the lead man, I'll occupy the next two while you reload. And Major, show no fear. - I hear tell ye be quite the ballroom dancer, Major. - Why parley such vanity where there be scalping knives? - It's a dance, son. Await the bow, before ye curtsey the both of us off to a diet of worms. - My heart, Mr. Gist. - No. No, Major, my heart. I've not- - No. - The Allegheny? - Aye. And from the sound of her, she'll be forbiddin' us to cross. - We shall see. - Ugh. My heart, Major. We'll not cross without a vessel. So I propose we return to Logstown and make quarters till the river bids us to cross. - Nay. - 'Tis a full day's journey, must make haste, Major. - I said, nay, Mr. Gist. We have confirmed, sir, that French have assembled an Army and a war fleet near Fort La Jonquière and that they intend to invade. Virginia is not prepared for war with France. Legardeur's reply to Governor Dinwiddie's remonstrance is expressly needed to secure military funding from the Congress and the full assurance of the Crown. We shall cross, and without delay. What else, sir, might you propose? - Two quant poles, Major. Fifteen feet, hollow to float. Use the Gunter chain to measure it out. Ten feet, we'll be rudderless. - Aye. - Major. - Aye? - Where be the Crown, now? - I know not your meaning. - Your high speech about the Crown and the Divine. I see no crown here. Nothing divine about that river. Where will we be if you and I swept off this very night. - Best I could muster. - I'll punt and rudder. You keep us clear of ice. It'll be coming fast and as big as a saltbox house. And Major, if we lose this barge in the tide, it be scant moments 'fore that icy water'll take your last breath. So you rescue not, but the far shore and that with dire haste. Steady, Major. - Aye, aye, aye! There, look sharp Major! - Left! Left! - Hold, Major! - Major! Major! Major! Major! Major, here! Here! Reach! Reach, Major! - Give rest, O' Lord, to your servant, Augustine Washington, with all the saints in heaven. Look with pity upon the sorrows of thy servants for whom prayers are for and give them peace through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. - You sir, have a cough of the lungs, for which I'd recommend a paste of honey, celery seed and pepper to be used every morning and evening till though be whole. - Patsy! - And do not go from a warm fire to a cold bed. - [Woman] Quit vexing the boy. - My sister, Elizabeth perished from such a cough. So I'd adhere to my cure to the letter. - [Woman] Come here, child. - And that sir, is the weight of it. - Cease your yowling! You are terrifying little George Washington. - Stay awake! - Legardeur's reply. Has it survived the river? - You're not shivering, son. - Has it survived the river? - Ye should be torn up with the shakes, yet, ye lay there still as a dustman. And do not sleep. You must stay awake. Your blood is freezing. If you sleep, you'll not awaken. - Did Legardeur's reply survive the river? - Bags were untouched by the river. It has survived. - That is good news, Mr. Gist. Good news, indeed. - I must gather fuel for the fire or neither you nor I will survive this night's cold. Stay awake. - Aye. The Minuet. You inquired of my skill on the dance floor. I am quite handy at the Minuet. Best in Virginia some would say. - Ye be chatterin' now, son. That's good. - I be frosted, Mr. Gist. Frosted. - I've been following Washington's career, and I believe he's quite the leader. - You're right, sir. - Colonel Fairfax, what say you about this commission? - George is rather young, but he's proved himself able. - Well said, sir. - Ah, Lord Fairfax. I just read our young Washington's report seems to be a trifle of flourishments in these words, what say you? - Young Washington's integrity be not the one in question. - The bloody flux is a retched disease making mortality a constant companion. - His skill surpasses the most noblest of gentry. - Shall we dance another? - Well, it would be my pleasure, dear sir, but I'm afraid I hotly vexed your admirers who would gladly see me dangle in the sheriff's picture-frame if we were to step again. Oh, but do tell me again, Colonel Washington, for you have failed to describe in any embellishment how you and Christopher Gist were rescued from that iceberg-besieged river. - 'Tis all in my journal, Sally. - Oh. - I was just discussing the sensational details with Dr. Craik here, of which having been published, my dearest darling, in newspapers, both here and abroad, have made our raw laddie here, the toast of these thirteen colonies. - Oh, well, I've even heard that the King, himself, has taken a peek at the venturous tale. - 'Twas Governor Dinwiddie's enterprise to make my report public record. Beyond that, I hid not the ending. - Nor did you add any flourish to the extraordinary fact that the very next morning- - The Allegheny had, to quote said, "flourish-less report," “shut up hard with ice” so that Colonel Washington, here, and Mr. Gist, simply strolled across it. - Aye. That would be the weight of it. - And, yet, that isn't quite, as you say, the "weight of it," is it, Colonel? - Please, Dear Doctor, has the boy not narrowly escaped the hostilities of the Ohio Valley only to be besieged right here in the Governor's Palace. - I am quite certain, my dear, after such a narrow escape, young Washington has grown quite impenetrable to words fired by a musket blast of gentlemanly inquiry. Pray tell, Doctor, what say you? - I say that I spoke to Mr. Christopher Gist earlier today. I have been treating the poor fellow, he's been stricken with a nasty case of frostbite. And, according to Mr. Gist, Colonel Washington fancies the timely occasion of a shut up Allegheny to be an act of Divine Providence, as opposed to the simple, scientific operation of water at thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit. - Yes, indeed. - And how, George, do you respond to this indictment that some would say to be unreasonable reasoning in the age, of reason, sir? - With bygone earnest I should expect. - I hold the thought of Divine Providence quite pleasing, kind sir. - As do I for this port. Find it to be quite pleasing indeed. Albeit a bit tart. - Well then, there you have it. - Dr. James Craik, Colonel. I've been assigned to serve as chief surgeon in your Provincial Regiment, sir. - 'Tis a pleasure, although I sincerely hope I will not be in need of your services, Doctor. - Aye, Colonel. - I shall, between musket fire and war whoops, look forward to the continuance of our discourse. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some matters to attend. - Uh, war whoops, you say? - Aye, and scalping knives. Good eve, William. A horse, please. - I trust not a man endowed with a flourishment of words, his deeds tend to fall short of the monuments constructed by his vocabulary. - If that be a compliment, dear lady, I attribute my lack of flourish not to any virtue, but to an inferior education, which I, daily, labor to improve. - I assume not your virtue, nor lack thereof, dear sir. - With whom might I have the pleasure of speaking? - I'm the wife of Mr. Daniel Custis. - Of New Kent County? - Of the Governor's Council. - My father and your husband knew of each other. He is well regarded. Now, if you will allow me, madam, it has been a very long evening. - Many in the House believe your trip to the French Commandant to be theatrics, to induce public sentiment, both here and abroad for war. - I assure you, the number of French Regulars I've appraised be not theater. - An appraisal based on Captain Jonquière's licensed tongue which vanished from restraint by a liberal dosing of wine, you count as reliable, sir. - The fact that I am a gentleman forbids me to answer such a query, madam. Good eve. - Do you also ascribe to the notion that an outpost officer, clearly lacking a military discipline, would be privy to the true nature of the French occupation in the Ohio Valley, or that Jonquière's description of insurmountable French presence in the Ohio Valley be not mere bluster to seduce the Indians in your charge. - Where madam, do you get your facts? - 'Tis in your journal, sir. - 'Tis all in your journal. - Well, sentiment or no, England is at war. - Why then, have no British Regulars landed in Alexandria to enforce the Governor's ultimatum? - I know not, perhaps a ship sails this very moment. - I can assure you no ship sails. - 'Tis a big blue sea, madam. - Doubt me not, Colonel. As well as being the wife of Daniel Custis, I am also the granddaughter of Sir Daniel Parke, aide-de-camp to the Duke of Marlborough and personal advisor to Queen Anne. I assure you, sir, I enjoy reliable sources both here and in England. No ship travels to our aid, sir. Virginia is alone in this enterprise. - Then why critique my appraisals in such a disagreeable manner? What? No quip, dear lady? - You appraise a mere six hundred. Are you aware there are reports of over fifteen hundred French Regulars landing on the southern shores of Lake Eerie? That, Colonel, will be an overwhelming force to an army of planters and shopkeepers that you have been promoted to command. And that, sir, is the weight of it. - What is your name, madam? - I have told you that I am the wife of Daniel Custis. - You've told me nothing. - I have, most assuredly, warned you that there will be a force of more than two-thousand- - You are that brass, little girl. A paste of honey, celery seed and pepper to be used every morning and evening till thou be whole and do not go from a warm fire- - To a cold bed. How is it that you revive my memory by a cold remedy? - Because it is an effective one, dear lady, and because I've thought of that brass, little girl many times since my father's death. You are the daughter of John Dandridge. And your name is- - Martha. My name is Martha. - [Washington] “I've gotten word that the French “were at the crossing of Youghiogheny about 18 miles away. “I hurried to this place as a convenient spot. “We have with natures assistance made a good entrenchment “and by clearing the bushes out of these meadows “prepared a charming field for an encounter. “I dispatched men to discover the enemy and their strength. “I must take the liberty of mentioning to Your Honor “the necessity there is for having goods out here “to give for services of the Indians. “They all expect it and refuse to scout “or do any thing without it. “These services are paid well by the French. “I really think with five or six hundred pounds “worth of proper goods sent, “it would be in our best interest.” - You're cloak, sir. Clean as a whistle. - Thank you, Ensign Gates. - Sir. - [Washington] “I have been obliged to pay shirts “for what they have already done, “which I cannot continue to do.” - I know ye must have seen enough fire for one day and fear the flames. I read a once story about three men who were thrown into a fire. As they looked on, a fourth walked in to protect them. A Divine presence saving them from the flames... But where be He now? We are just man against undivine man, until we all be consumed and burned in the flames. You take first watch. We ride out at dawn. - Pa, it's me. - That is a good way to get hurt, boy. - The French. They raided and burnt the cabin this morning looking for you. Ma and the girls are unhurt. They fled to Logstown and will meet us there. - Take this. Go into those trees. Don't make a sound. - You don't strike me as someone who plays with dolls. - Are you Mr. Christopher Gist? - Who be askin'? - I am Ensign Drouillon, of the French Regulars stationed at Fort Duquesne. My superior here, Captain Jumonville, has received word that ye may be working with the British as a spy. - I have no quarrel with the French, nor does my loyalty lie with the British. I am but a simple farmer. - What right do ye have to defy the French authorities? - I have no intention of defying French authority, but I am certain I have every right to defend my family. - Do ye expect to defeat our entire regiment alone? - Your ole friend, Half-King and fifty of his warriors lie in wait. Are you certain you want to do this today? - We will be watching you, Mr. Gist. - Son. I must warn Washington. Tell your mother to meet me at the great crossing. Go. Quickly. - I asked for seventy-four wagons at Winchester. Why have ye arrived with only one? - Indeed, we been sent from Winchester, sir, but I don't know about the seventy-four wagons. But I do know we have another one arriving soon. - Arriving soon? - Yes, sir. - What are you doing driving military supplies? Who sent you? - Captain Van Braam, please help your nephew unload the wagon. - Captain Broadwater sent us, sir. I've always wanted a chance to be in the army. At least drivin' these here wagons, I gets to do my part... I'm sorry, but I'm just doing as I'm told and ye have these two wagons, compliments of Captain Broadwater, sir. - I suppose we'll have to make do then. - [Driver] Yes, sir. - What is your name, driver? - Samuel Jenkins, sir. - Ensign Bland. - Sir? - See to it that Mister Jenkins and his horses are refreshed. - [Bland] Aye, sir. - [Jenkins] Thank you, sir. - Let me help. Carry on, Jenkins. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. - Colonel. - Report, Major. - Provisions from Winchester have been inadequate, at best. Dr. Craik removed four more men from duty, stricken with the bloody fluxes. - That'd be five, sir. - Find out the cause of this, Dr. Craik. - The cause be these filthy condition. Clean up your bloody tent, lad. - Is that all, Major? - Last night, the scouts examined movement in the wild. Our sentries fired. The men stayed on arms till dawn, but we found no enemy. - Was roll called this morn'? - Aye. Six men are missing. Shall I dispatch a company? - Nay. We've sent twenty-three men out after deserters already. Record the names, and send them to Governor Dinwiddie. Now, Major Stobo, is that all? - Christopher Gist has arrived from Wills Creek, sir. - Thank you, Major. Good day, Mr. Gist! - Colonel now, is it? - Aye. - Did I overhear Captain Van Braam murmuring about a lack of supplies? - Indeed, we are nearing the end of our provisions. - How be the lowlander these days? - He is still, what did you call him, Mr. Gist? - Bit of a high class dandy. But, I do not hold that against him. - He is proficient at the sword, having been my instructor at Mount Vernon and a decent translator. - [Mr. Gist] I trust not his French. - Nor his English, if truth be told. - Nonetheless, he is the only translator we have so, therefore we shall make do with his French. Have ye eaten? - Hardtack, Mr. Gist. Soaked in rum. A delicacy of the Virginia Militia. - Aye. Thank you, Doctor. I've heard many tales about the fine dining of a military campaign. - Certainly no match for your wife's stew. - Deer jerk. I trust ye will find it better than the hardtack. Well, then, Mr. Gist, what brings you to our charming field? - I was paid a visit by the French. - The French? - Aye. Captain Jumonville and his regulars from Fort Duquesne. It seems the news of my loyalty to the crown has become widespread. They burned my farm for helpin' you last winter. - Hard news. - Aye. - They are greedy for land south of the Ohio. Do ye believe that vengeance was his true intent? - If it was not, 'tis now. - With the fall of Fort Prince George, there are now no fortifications between our position, and the French. We must fortify as quickly as possible. - [Mr. Gist] That is not all, Colonel. - Go on. - Ridin' here, I came across their tracks. North-east. Not five miles from this very tent. - How many men? - [Mr. Gist] Thirty, likely more. - The French are either spying or setting an ambush. - [Mr. Gist] Aye. - James, alert Captain Stephens to muster his men, two days' rations, forty rounds of powder, and fresh flints. We shall march to the Half-King this eve. - Aye, Colonel. - Do not rush to arms, son. - If ye be right about the tracks belonging to Jumonville, Mr. Gist, we are already late to arms. The French are to remain in the belief that our numbers are greater, until we be reinforced by Colonel Fry and his New York Companies. If I might impose upon you yet again, my friend. - I helped you once, now my family be endangered. - Ye still be a loyal subject of the Crown, and my fellow compatriot. This circumstance may lead to an open conflict with the French. Governor Dinwiddie must be informed. For the sake of your family, if for no other reason. - I suppose the French will not stop at threats. I'll see to it. Colonel... my heart, yet again. - Mr. Gist. - What say ye this stormy eve cousin? - Can ye imagine it, a world of little people with one giant. - Ah... Gulliver's Travels. Well, it's not unlike the world today. When a great office is vacant, five or six candidates petition the emperor to entertain his majesty with a dance on the rope; and whoever jumps the highest without falling, succeeds in the office. - Can we not enjoy one eve without you plotting your next move. - [Lord Fairfax] I'm just quoting the book, William. I've received word that our young Washington is in need of supplies. - [Lord Fairfax] And... did you petition the Governor? I've long pondered, Thomas, if it were your studied intent to see the boy fail in the Ohio. Last winter, ye asserted your influence to see Governor Dinwiddie, send the boy into the wild with the letter of remonstrance, but now ye assert none when he petitions for aid and supplies. Why? - So entrenched in his noble ideals, our young Washington. 'Tis why I did pick the boy, William. - Ye picked the boy? - Like a ripe apple. - For what did ye pick him? - Why, for the task at hand, of course. There is not a finer officer than one who is unafraid to fight alongside his men. - Ye speak of war, Thomas. What plot have ye hatched? - At this very hour, whispers are finding their way into the ears of King George of the threat the French pose in acquiring the land in the Ohio Valley for the Crown, including our five million acres. - So you do speak of the Ohio. You would rather see our boys die in bloody war- - What did ye think? That I was to entrust the Fairfax Land Grant to the inept and bumbling House of Burgesses, who've thrice attempted to deprive me, us, you, and your dear son of our land? Our wealth? Our future? - And what of the fate of young Washington? - Hm. - There. Across there. - Laddie! - I'm all right. I'm all right. - You should check your pants Captain! I can smell it from here. It's just an owl. - Watch your step, boys. Stephens. - Here. Hostiles, sir? - 'Tis the Half-King, our brother. - I thought he promised us fifty warriors? There are but ten. - We'll have to make do. Come. The Half-King will lead us to the French encampment. - All right, men let's go. - I count thirty-five. - Aye. We be evenly-matched, sir. - Colonel. These be well-used French Marines, and we be farmers, land lopers, and convicts. - And we have been in rain all night. Our powder may be wet, and Bessie may not be in the mood to pop-off this morn'. - My girl hasn't failed me yet. We'll be ready. - Waggoner, tell Stephens to fix bayonets. If our muskets fail, he and his men are to join us in charging the camp. - Aye. - Major Stobo, hold fire till I give command. - Aye. Follow me. - Captain Van Braam... stay by my side. I shall have need of your French. - Aye, Colonel. At your side I shall remain. - Bayonets one, or all of us? Let's go. Bayonets. There's no time to be fearful. - Mm-hmm. - It's time to be brave. - Mm-hmm. - La Force. - Fire at will! Fire at will! - Ah. I told the Colonel ye wouldn't fail me, lass. Now look what ye gone and done! - Colonel Washington, sir! Colonel Washington. Colonel Washington we've got them on the- - So you want to dance? Ah. Let's hunt. Come on, boy! - Stephens! Stephens! - Stobo! Van Braam! - I can manage, Colonel. Go on. Go on! - Charge! - I don't understand what you're saying? Van Braam! Captain Van Braam! - I don't understand. - Colonel Washington! - Easy now. Easy. Here we go. Oh. - Easy, Major. I thought you said you were trained in the medical. - Aye. Dr. Craik gave me a lesson before we left camp. He said the main thing is to clean the wound, so I cleaned the wound. Congratulations on your first military victory, Colonel. - What are the casualties? - One killed, sir. Three wounded. - Very well. Pass on my compliments to your men. - Aye, Colonel. - [Woman] Do you want another pint, love. - [Man] I'll take a pint, and some love. - [Woman] Oh, you always joke and your never funny. - [Man] Can't knock a man for trying. - [Man] Gentlemen. Gentlemen! We have to trade for the Ohio. - Might I have a minute of your time, sir? - Well, that dear lady would depend upon what you propose we do with the time ye be soliciting. - I wish to contribute to my husband's defense of Colonel George Washington. - I should think you'd be entirely content with your tea parties and needle work, and happily leave the politicking to the men.
