(silence) (typewriter tapping) (footsteps crunching) (whining and screeching tones) (synth tone music) (low droning) (sighs) (mysterious synth music) - Have a good day now. (tense swooshing tones) (splash) (ice cream truck music) - Oh my God I'm so sorry. - No it's okay. I needed to cool off, I guess I didn't know it. - Will say you're sorry to the nice lady. Will, you sprayed her with the hose say you're sorry. - I'm sorry. - It's okay, really. - I'm Jessica. - Hi, I'm Mary. - When did you move in? - We bought the house a month ago but we haven't fully moved in. I've been here for a couple days. Just barely in furniture just the boxes I brought on my drive here. My husband is in Seattle with the kids for another week. They're just finishing up school. - Oh they must finish late out there. - Yeah it's a charter school. - How old are your kids? - 13 and five. My, my oldest is from my first marriage, I was so young. - Oh. - I'm from here originally, I grew up here. (chuckles) Lot of memories. - I don't mean to pry but why the move back? - My husband works for a tech company and they opened up an office downtown. - Do you still have family here? - No. I thought my kids might like growing up in the suburbs, you know, small town life. - I sure do. Do you work Mary or just inside the home. - I am a freelance writer. Mostly editorial blog stuff. - Oh like the Huffington Post. - Yeah kinda. - [Blonde Haired Lady] Will. - Okay I should get going. I've got furniture being delivered today, I should get changed. - Sorry again about that. I hope you and your husband can come over for dinner sometime. - Yeah. Yeah that sounds nice. Okay. - Welcome to the neighborhood Mary. (sighs) (electronic ethereal music) (sighs) (phone ringing) - Hi, how's everything? - Hey. - [Husband] Good. - You guys on your way to school? - [Husband] Yup, today already. (sighs) - How are you? - I'm good. - I miss you guys though. - [Husband] Awh, we miss you too. - Did I tell you that I got some chairs? - [Husband] No, what kind of chairs? - The biggest ones I could fit in my car.

(chuckling) - [Husband] Making friends already. What's her name? - Jessica. - [Husband] Very nice. - Her son sprayed me with a hose. (laughing) - [Husband] On purpose? - No not on purpose he's like four. - [Husband] Oh well yeah. - Did you know that we had an ice cream truck? - [Husband] Oh great, that's what they need, more sugar. Well, it'll help with the transition I guess. - No it was super weird. Felt like I was in a time warp or something. Dunno, something about him was so creepy. - [Husband] Ew, how was the ice cream? - No I didn't get anything. - [Husband] Well look we've gotta try it when we get there. - Eugh, I can't wait for you guys to get here. - [Husband] Us too. - I don't think I've been alone since, God since Jakey was born. What did I do before kids? - [Husband] I know right? - I should go out and have some wild nights. You know, reclaim my youth or whatever. - [Husband] Yeah why don't you go party with some soccer moms? - How are my babies? Can you put them on speaker? - [Husband] Sure, hey do you guys wanna say hi to your mom? - Hi guys. I can't wait to see you. Jacob are you so excited to be almost done with school? - [Jacob] Yeah. - I can't wait to see you. - [Jacob] Okay. - Come on Jakey it'll be, you'll love it out here. - [Jacob] Whatever. - Shelby, how are you? - [Shelby] Hi mommy. - How's my sweet girl? - [Shelby] Good, I miss you. - I miss you too baby. - Hey Shelby. - [Husband] Hey I'm almost at Jacob's school so I gotta let you go but, how's the writing? How's it coming? Hello? (sighs) - It's okay. I keep having these great starts and then they fizzle out. I think I'm just trying to force it. - [Husband] Hey it'll come. - I know, thank you. - [Husband] Okay I'm here. Okay, we'll call you later okay? - Love you guys! - Yeah I love you too! - Love you too. - Bye. - Bye. (knocking) - Hi, you must have my furniture. - Yeah. - Okay, great. I'm ready for you.

I mean when was the last time you didn't have your kids around? - 12 years. - Oh honey. You've been a mom since you were a baby, you poor thing. - Yeah I had my son really young, but I wouldn't change it for anything you know? - Of course you wouldn't. Don't pay any attention to Katie, she has foot and mouth disease. - [Katie] Oh please. - Come on we wanna show our new neighbor a little hospitality. - I don't know. - You don't even have furniture. Why don't you let us cook for you? I bet you don't have any food in the house. - Okay. - Okay!

What'll it be? - Um, what do you have? - Oh we've got it all. - Do you have Nestle French Bars? - I'm afraid not. I'm a purest. Just regular old ice cream. Cups, cones and shakes. No store bought confections here. - Wow really? - This is the real deal. So. What flavor? - Uh I don't know. I usually just get the bars, I'm not really an ice cream person. - Well, today's you're lucky day then isn't it? Time to try something new. - Can I take a look? - Sure. Come on up. - Rum Raisin's my favorite. - Ew what is that? - It's probably more of an old fashioned flavor. But then again I am an old fashioned guy. - [Tracy] Oh what's this one? - That's rainbow sherbet. - [Tracy] Yum. - There are a lot of choices. - [Tracy] Oh this one looks good. (door clanks) - Does it? - What are you doing? - Just giving you the personal experience. - Yeah, no thanks I think I'll just go. - But you haven't picked a flavor yet? - Let me out. - What I should just walk you out? - [Tracy] Let me out! (slice) (slow distant ice cream truck music) (door clanks) (engine rumbles) (old fashioned jazz music) (chattering) * For he's a jolly good fellow * For he's a jolly good fellow * For he's a jolly good fellow * Which nobody can deny (whooping) - Yay! Divine, got them all. - Thanks mom. - Um guys come on, come on. It's chocolate. - [Max] You need to have this right? - Yeah yeah. - On your own? - Havin' fun? - Yeah. - This isn't quite your scene is it? - Sure it is. Just takin' it all in. - You miss your husband? - Yeah. - Well if you ever had the desire to cheat now would be the time to do it. I have a really good vibrator. - Well if you'll excuse me I have to go find my kids. (muffled music) * I scream you scream, we all scream for ice cream * And sherbet * Shoot the sherbet to the Herbert * Shoot the sherbet to me Herbert * Shoot the sherbet to me Herbert * Shoot the sherbet to me Herbert, shoot it bad - Hey mom. How's it going? (sighs) - Oh it is going. - Suburbs. Weird huh? - Yeah, I forgot how much. - It's like a big bubble. - A bubble that means well, but still a bubble. - I can't wait to get outta here. - Don't be in too much of a rush. Crazy resides everywhere. - Yeah right. - Where are you going to school? - State. - Another bubble, a bigger bubble. - Bigger is always better right? - Not always but you'll figure that out. - Yeah? - Not at first but you will. - Hey have you seen Tracy? - No. Not since the best part of my night.

So where you been all my life Mary? - Living in Seattle with my husband. - Well now that is a shame, cause uh. - 'Scuse me. - Whatever. - Hey, where you goin'? - I've had enough for one night. - Oh. Okay. - Maybe we can talk about the meaning of life another time. - Well if you want anymore, you know, just tell me mom you want yard work done. She'll let me know. - You're a grass worker. - Yeah I guess, I guess I am. See you later Mary. (smooching) (distant dog barking) (slow threatening droning music) - I could've sworn I left that light on. (unsettling chiming music) (keys rattling) (distant screaming) (relaxed ethereal music) - Good morning Mary. You're a runner? - More or less. - Oh how do you find the time? - Well my family's across the country so you can find time for lots of things. - Ah, so it would seem. - Oh you know I found this hairpin on the ground over there. I think it's um, is it Tracy's? Max's girlfriend? - Why do you think it's Tracy's? - I remember her wearing it the other night at the party. I dunno I just remember those things. Okay, uh yeah well hey. If you see her. Ask he if she lost a hairpin? - Okay sure. How are things going in the house? - Oh, good, good. You know, I drove down with all these boxes to set everything up for the kids before they got here but. - You drove, alone? - [Mary] Yeah. - Weren't you afraid? - No. I uh, I was looking for writing inspiration and I was listening to these great podcasts. - Well I hope you were carrying a gun at least. - No, I don't own a gun. - Well you need to go get one. There's a lot of crazies out there you know? - Yes, yes there are. Mhm. Uh anyway, I can't wait for the cable company to come and hook everything up because I'm losing my mind in there. - [Christina] Yeah. - And the yard's a total mess. - Well we know. - Wait, Max does yard work right? - Yeah he does. - No really I need somebody to clean up the yard. So how would I book him? - I'll just have him and his friends come by. - Oh great, thank you. I'm just so fuckin' tired of doin' yard work. Sorry, uh sorry. - 'Kay, well I gotta run, gotta go get carpool started so. - See you later. (unsettling music) (sighs) (ice cream truck music) What is it about the suburbs? Hi Jessica. How are you doing this morning? - Oh just fine. Your husband coming soon? - Not soon enough. Still two more days for me to get into trouble. (doorbell ringing) - Hi Mary. I heard you needed yard work. - Yes, yes I do. Oh no. I actually do need yard work. - Oh, sorry. - No it's okay. I'll take that too. - This is Nick and Joe. - Hey guys. - So what did you need done? - I don't know. Just the front yard cleaned up a bit. Lets go take a look. Yeah it's not too bad. There's barely any lawn. I can go check the backyard and see if there are any weeds to pull. - [Max] That's easy enough. - How much do you guys charge? - 100 bucks. - Hey we'll throw in a little greens for the deal. - Alright cool, sounds perfect. So um, how's Tracy? - I don't know. I haven't heard from her. She's probably just mad at me. - Really? Why? - [Max] Well she won't text me back, she bailed on my party. - Does she have a reason to be mad at you? - Eugh, yeah probably. - He told her he wants to be single in college. - I'm just bein' honest. - Yep well there you go. Uh let me think, what else can I have you guys do while you're here, um. Do you guys clean pools? Just kidding, alright let me check the back. - Not feelin' it today boys? - It's too fuckin' hot for this shit man. - It's called summer. - Just got a text from Brie, I'm outta here. - What? - Just take my cut of the money. - Yeah but that's twice as much work for both of us. - Gotta get some ass, later dudes. - Oh thanks a lot. - Nick, c'mon. - Sorry. - Where's he goin'? - What do you call the opposite of a gentlemen caller? - Oh. (ice cream truck music) - Hello there young fellow. - Are you kidding me? - Am I kidding you about what? - Uh, your shtick. - You know, some things in this life are sacred the ice cream truck being one of them. Is it so wrong to make it more special for the little kids? - So what you're always in character? - I guess you could say that. So, what'll it be my friend? Come on up, that's where all my coolers are. What flavor? Might I suggest pralines and cream? - Uh two chocolate cones please. - Well doesn't that sounds delicious. - A traditionalist I see. - Yeah whatever. (haunting pulsing music) Oh yeah. Thanks. - Don't you want your change? - [Nick] You keep it. (ringing) - For me? That's so sweet. (smooches) - Oh here. - Thanks baby. My parents won't be back until Monday. Should just say you're staying at Max's. - Okay. God what are you trying to do to me? - Nothing. - Uh. (smooching) (doorbell ringing) Who's coming over? - Nobody. - You sure? - Yeah, will you answer the door? - No way I've got a huge boner. - Uh fine. - Hello young lady. Would you mind if I used your bathroom? - What? - I don't have one on the truck you see. - I don't think so. I don't know you. (frantic music) - Fuck, let go of her. (slicing) (thump) (smacking) (urinating) (haunting music) (toilet flushes) (ice cream truck music) (tools clanking) - Are you guys done? - Yeah. - Here I wrote you a check it's um, made out to cash. - Okay great. - Thanks again guys. Hi Jessica. - She is such a nosy fuck. - Yes. Okay I'll see you guys later. (haunting music) (ice cream truck music) (doorbell ringing) - Hi. - Hey. - Great. - Thanks. - Thanks.

Come in. - Okay. - Have a seat. Can I get you something? - What have you got? - Beer, vodka. Wait a second, I can't give you any of that. - Oh come on spare me, like you didn't drink in high school? - Of course I did. Being around you guys, it's like a constant reminder of my high school days. - I bet you were cute. - Stop it, I am not giving you alcohol. - Suit yourself mom. You know technically I'm in college now. - How about we just smoke some pot. And then I have to go. - Go where? - Go be an adult without a teenager in my house. - [Max] Where's the rest of your furniture? - Movers. And I got some new stuff. Change is good. (distant police siren) - You should sit on the couch closer to me. - I'm cool here thanks. (coughing) Sorry. - It's all good. Oh hey. It's for you. - Ah thanks, it's exciting. (chuckling) (gentle muffled music) - I love this song. - The only music I hear these days is Disney. - Come on Mary, be young, dance with me. - Be young? - I really didn't mean it like that. Come on you're cool and hotter than most of the girls my age. - You're bad. - Am I? Come on Mary. - Oh okay, yep. You are too young to know how to dance like this. - No I'm not, I was raised on Dancing With the Stars. - Don't remind me. Okay it's time for you to go trouble. - Trouble is relative. - I'm not even gonna respond to that. - Mary Mary quite contrary. - Goodbye my friend, maybe in another lifetime. (doorbell ringing) What? - I don't have your number. - Why do you need my number? - Just in case. - Just in case what? - Look you could have mine too, you know, if you need yard work. (ice cream truck music) - No. - Hey. I can call and text first, or I can just show up. - 206 8471. - Well that is a shitty number. Couldn't you have got some repetition? - [Mary] Bye, bye Max. - Hey I'll text you so you have mine. - Cool. (doorbell ringing) (unsettling music) Max? (phone ringing) - [Shelby] Mommy! - [Mary] Hi baby. - [Shelby] I can't wait to see you. - Awh. One more day. I'll see you tomorrow. - [Shelby] I'll go give you 100 kisses. - I'm gonna give you 101 kisses. When do you guys land again? - [Husband] 2:35, you don't have to pick us up from the airport, I'll get a car. - Okay, I'll be here waiting.

How 'bout a shake? - Um, sure. - What flavor? No, wait. Lemme guess, vanilla. You look like a vanilla kinda gal. Although, tonight, you look like you might want something a little more decadent. Am I wrong? Vanilla's fine thank you. - Okay, super. How about you young man? You wanna taste something sweet? - Nah I'm cool thanks. - I can see that. - You look really good tonight. - Shh. (whirring) - You kids be good now you hear? - Come on, let' go this way to the park. (ice cream truck music) I'm really glad you came here tonight. How's the shake? - It's good. - Can I have a sip? - You can kill it. (smooching) (haunting music) (grunting and groaning) - That was awesome. (chuckling) - Did you hear that? - Yeah. - What was it? - I don't know, relax. Probably just a squirrel or something. Hey hey, hey. - We can't do this again. - Why not? - Because I'm old enough to be your mother. - Not really. - And I'm married. - [Max] You are so sexy. - If I were 18. But I'm not. Life is complicated. - Can I at least still see you when your family gets here. - I don't think it's a good idea. I'm sorry. - Are you okay? - You made me feel young again. (screeching tones) - What the fuck? - What is he doing? - I don't know. Let's get the fuck outta here though Mary come on, go. (frantic pulsing music) Go just run! Mary go keep running, I'll draw him away. - Max! (slice) - Argh! - Max! - [Max] No. (slicing) - No! (slow tapping tones) Fucker! (smack) - You whore.
