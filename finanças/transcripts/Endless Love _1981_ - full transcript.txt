(dramatic orchestral music) [Teacher] All right, everybody, settle down. Now that you've seen the heart, let's go. To the planetarium. [Narrator] It is awesome to think of the hundreds of billions of stars spread in any infinite volume of space. Too vast for the human mind to comprehend. In ancient times, man thought of the stars-- Hi. [Narrator] As the mythological gods themselves. But now we know they're bright centers of their own universes. Our lives seem like small grains of sand-- [Jade] It's scary, isn't it? [Narrator] Compared to the immortality of the stars. [Jade] It's like trying to think about dying. [Narrator] Regardless of their distance and mystery. What would you do if I died? [Narrator] The heavenly stars, the shrinking planetary system. I'd die. [Narrator] The red giants. I'd die, too. [Narrator] The white dwarfs continue to fascinate man, dazzling him as beautifully designed jewels against the evening sky. (all cheering) Okay, that's all for today. But on the way back to the bus, everyone stop and take a look at the moon rock. It's fascinating. It's over four billion years old. Hey, you. What are you doing here? You don't belong in this group. What's your name? Uh, David. David Axelrod, sir. I'm a senior, sir. I'm taking independent study. (kids laughing) Go on, get outta here, get outta here. Come on, let's go. Everybody, this way. Let's go. (all chattering) Roy, I don't want you to worry about this. We've got a lot of options open to us, we really have. I mean, we can always appeal. [Roy] There's nothing we can do about it. Yes, there is now. There's a hell of a lot we can do. They only took it to the state court. We're gonna do, huh? We're gonna be murdered in the appellate, - right here in Illinois. - No, not necessarily. Yes, we are. We gotta push it to the Supreme Court. I don't know where we're gonna find any of the money for this. [Woman] Gotta get a seat. (all chattering) Mom, I'm going. [Man] Rose, I've been through them all. Mom? Yeah, but what do you think? Do you think we have the chance there-- [David] Mother, I'm going. What? [David] Good night, everybody. [Woman] What is this, Halloween? I thought Halloween was October. It's a special occasion. We're all dressing up. My God, is that my old tuxedo? Was I ever really that skinny? Listen, if you're not eating at home, why don't you tell your mother? I'm going to Jade's. Who's Jade? A Chinese person? Yeah. She just arrived from the People's Republic of China. She's studying capital investment. [Mom] Oh, what else? How do you like that? We call ourselves socialists, and our son dresses like a Rockefeller. Leave him alone. He's in love. (bicycle bell dings) [David] You're beautiful. (laughing) Come on, we should go in. Everybody's-- David, where'd you get the threads? [Jade] You look fantastic. Uh, it's my father's old tux. (distant chattering) Hi, Sammy. Hey, David's here. Can we eat now? (speaking foreign language) Hey. Hi, Hugh. (speaking foreign language) Hey, David, have you seen the insects we're having for dinner tonight? Shut up, smart-ass. I'm trying to educate this boy's palate. (speaking foreign language) Smells delicious. Delicious? You damn with faint praise, my boy. [Keith] The knife goes on the left, the fork goes on the right. [Sammy] The fork goes on the left, the knife goes on the right. [Keith] No, it doesn't. The knife goes on the left with the spoon. [Sammy] The knife goes near the glass on the right. [Keith] No, it doesn't. The fork goes on, you take the fork, put it on the right. The knife goes on the left. [Ann] David? Is he here? [Sammy] David, does the fork-- Good evening, Ann. [Ann] I don't want you to look. What's going on? What? [Ann] Close your eyes. Keep your eyes closed, don't look. What? (laughs) [Sammy] Mom, where'd you get that? [David] Where are you? Tell him to keep your eyes closed. Wait till you see this, David. Ta-da! Oh, wow. That's incredible, Ann. That's beautiful. Have you ever seen anything like it? I found it in this thrift shop. Look at it, look at the fabric. It's falling apart. It's pure silk. Oh, don't pick at it! (laughing) It's 2,000 years old. It looks that way. Oh, woof! David, David, you look smashing in that. Thank you. Eat, drink, and be merry. Wow, looks great, Dad. [Hugh] Special of the house. Wine, who's gonna get the wine? I'll get it. Where is it? In the pantry. [Jade] I'll show him. There, right there. Get the red one. This? [Jade] Yep. I love red wine. How about this? [Jade] Okay, good. Two's enough. I was arguing with Sammy before. Does the fork go on the right side of the plate or the left side of the plate? Are you right-handed or left-handed? Right-handed. Then put it on the other side. Let's go. I love you. [Hugh] Where's that wine? Let's go. Sammy, bring the corkscrew while you're there. Laugh, my lads. Have on with drinking. 'Tis drinking makes the world go round! (all cheering) Bravo, bravo. I've got one, I've got one. I remembered it, I remembered it the other day. Um, wine comes in at the eye-- [Hugh] No, no. (laughing) No, you got it all wrong. And love comes in at the mouth. [Hugh] No. Wine comes in at the mouth. [Hugh] Bravo. [Ann] And love comes in at the eye. Eye, the eye. [Ann] And that's all we know for truth before we grow old and die. I lift my glass to my mouth, I look at you, Hugh. (laughing) And I sigh. Oh. (all clapping) (all cheering) Thank you. (distant horn honking) Who is that riffraff out there? (distant chattering) (laughing) [Keith] Is that Susan? (all chattering) [Hugh] Who's Susan? Wait till you hear her new song. Do you like the way she sings? Yeah. She's really sexy. [Sammy] Hey, David. (all chattering) [Man] Keith, where's the bathroom? Are we in a gymnasium or something? You look ravishing tonight. Thank you. Did anyone ever tell you that? Wait, you've, wait, hold on. You have a little chocolate right there. I do? (laughing) Here they come. Troubled masses. Come in, come in. Welcome to my humble abode. Can you take these? They're heavy. What do you expect me to do with those? That's my father, not the butler, idiot. Go in there. It's all set up. (all chattering) [Hugh] Bonsoir, bonsoir. Mommy. Come here. Mommy, I want you to meet Susan. This is my mother. This is Susan? Hello, Susan. I'm happy to meet you. Nice to meet you. [Jade] Not know. [David] I'm not gonna be here all night. [Jade] I'll wait. [David] No. (laughing) Hey, David, I've been looking all over for you. I thought you were gonna help us set up. Well, he's busy right now. Yeah, I see. You know Pappy doesn't like us bringing people in here. David is not people. He's part of the family. Hmm. Well, Pappy wants his trumpet. Bring it down when you're finished playing doctor, please. (sighs) He thinks he runs the place. [David] Did you really mean that? That he runs the place? No. What you said about me being part of the family. You like that, don't you? Yeah, I like that. But watch out. We are a very special family. We are very particular about who joins. Come on, let's go. (upbeat rock music) (all chattering) (all clapping) (all cheering) (laughing) Hey, thank you. (all clapping) Hey, Susan, Susan, do you wanna sing? Come on. You have to sing. Quiet down. Sit down, quiet down. Shh shh!

I'm in charge of the fireplace here! Nobody builds fires in my fireplace except me. It's the one thing in this goddamn house that still belongs to the master. I am retiring. Come on, Hugh. [Hugh] It's time for this boy to be going home. I'll go home when it's burned down. I'll go home when it's burned down, sir! Aye, aye, sir. [Ann] All right, then. All right, then. You go when it's burned down. Oh, God. Oh, these steps seem like Mount Everest. You were great with the trumpet, Pappy! Oh, thank you, honey! A little out of practice, I'm afraid.

Uh, yeah, I've got a big day ahead of me tomorrow. I have, um, biology in the morning. Yeah, I have a French test. [Jade] I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, good night. [Jade] Good night.

He got it for me. Who got it for you? David. We were talking about Russian writers, Gogol, and the next day he brought it over for me. I thought it was very nice of him. Mm, I just bet you did. I bet you gave his cheek a nice little peck, huh? Didn't you? Hmm? I don't miss a trick, my friend. Oh, good night. (laughing) (light orchestral music) (floorboard creaking) (light orchestral music) (upbeat rock music) (car horn honking) Hi, Dad! Oh, hi! (door clicking) Are you coming or going? Going. Hugh said we all have to get up at five tomorrow. We're gonna go duck hunting. So I've been told. You know, I read those stories. The ones you published in "The Atlantic." I'd like to talk to you about them sometime. Sometime. You don't have to court us all. You sort of invited yourself along for tomorrow morning. Didn't you? Keith was talking about it and it sounded really interesting. I'm sure Hugh was very flattered. But don't try too hard with Keith. I know. He was the one who brought you home in the first place. You were his find. You turned out to be more than that. Well, I better be going. Good night. (gun firing) (ducks quacking) Good shot! God, he's amazing. Where did he learn to shoot like that? In the Army? No, he was in the Air Force, right? His father taught him. My grandfather was taught how to shoot by his father. It's a family tradition. My grandfather built that place. Then Pappy let it go. I'm going to rebuild the whole thing one of these days. Yeah? That's a great idea. You're good at doing stuff like that. I'll help you, okay? We'll come up here on weekends. And Jade would love it. Imagine getting up in the morning with the lake right there. I mean, of course, this is a place for the whole family. Just because you're fucking my sister doesn't make you part of the family. I don't know about you, but after that movie, I am going to have a drink. I'll join you in a moment.

Then we'll die together. Come on. What's that look? David is here. I just caught them bare-assed up in her room. Oh, my God. I thought it was something awful. (sighs) You were meant to catch them, I'm sure. She didn't even bat an eyelash. Well, you didn't raise her to be a hypocrite. I mean, you know he's been staying over, don't you? Yes. He hides in the house till they think we're asleep, and, of course, he scuttles away at dawn. They're rather sweet. Like bats. I don't know what to do about this. I'm so happy to hear you say that. You're always so definite with the children. Let's all be open about sex. Well, they certainly got the idea. They feel free to express love. It's worth all those awful frank discussions at the dining room table. I'm not talking about morality. Does this boy think he can just come in here and take over our life? They believed everything that we said. Imagine. A girl like that doesn't have to take the first guy who comes along. Oh, I didn't realize we were saving her for somebody special. Oh. (scoffs) Are we saving her for someone rich? God damn it! That's not fair! The girl is 15 years old! Now, when is she gonna study, when is she gonna sleep? Now, come on, you're the one who's always saying she's sleeping too much. I know it's difficult, but aren't you happy that she has someone? That someone finally had the courage to wake up Sleeping Beauty? It had to happen sooner or later. Class, please take your book, "The Essentials of American History," and turn to page 47. Mobilizing for War. Come on, page 47. Hurry up. [Teacher] "Congressmen face the overwhelming task "in raising and organizing armies--" (knocking on door) Come in. Well, you're home early tonight. How's Jade? Fine. She's got a French test tomorrow and I've got all this. We decided we've got to study. Well, you always get good grades. A few years from now who's gonna remember what grade you got in calculus? That's not what you're gonna remember about this time of your life. Is it? Huh? Uh-uh. Are you happy? Yeah. [Dad] Good for you. Good night. [David] Good night. (phone rings) Hello? (speaking foreign language) [Jade] I've just finished the translation up to where she traps the bus. She what? [Jade] She traps the bus. She traps a bus? (laughing) It doesn't mean that. It means she catches the bus. Attraper means she catches a bus. Come on, concentrate. Hey, I love you. I love you, too. The French are very energetic. You would rather trap a bus-- Hey, mademoiselle? (speaking foreign language) You've been on over an hour. Will you give me a break, please? (sighing) (speaking foreign language) Yeah, if he's not here, he's on the phone. Pardon, I have to study. (speaking foreign language) Bitch. (light orchestral music) I'm going to name a star after you. I'll put it-- Where? Do you think I'm too small on top? You're perfect. My eyes are too close together. They're perfect. When I'm wrinkled and fat, you'll stop loving me. C'est la vie. I'll never stop loving you. You can't say that. You don't know. Yes, I do. I knew that from the very first. I'll never stop loving you. I'll never want to. You're all I care about. And me, the person I am when I'm with you. It's kinda scary. It keeps on getting stronger and stronger. I used to think it'd be like being thirsty. Sometimes you feel like you've had enough. (light orchestral music) It's not like that, it's not like that. You better go. I've got to sleep. I don't wanna stop, ever. Being with you. I don't wanna go. (door clicking) (dog barking) Hugh? [Hugh] Yeah? What time is it? I don't know. Go back to sleep. (door squeaking) [Ann] What's the matter? Wait a minute. (door clicking) (rattling) What are you doing? [Jade] What? No. Come on, come here. Give me, open your hand, damn it! Jesus Christ, I don't believe this! I can't sleep. [Hugh] You don't fool around with these things! I can't sleep. [Hugh] Neither can anybody else in this house! (Jade sobbing) [Ann] Hugh, for heaven's sake. Well, she just comes in here and helps herself to these pills. I needed something to sleep! You don't just help herself to pills like this! Well, why don't you lock the cabinet? It's too early for all this shouting. Let her have a pill. [Hugh] Would you stay the hell out of this? I'm the doctor here, and I don't want her to have these. (sobbing) Then give me something else! You bring this goddamn boyfriend over here. You keep everybody else awake! I'm fed up with this! I can't sleep with all this racket going on! I will not have this family torn apart! David cannot stay here! Yes, he can. It is my room. We are not a couple of little kids. [Hugh] He doesn't give a damn about you. All he cares about is his own satisfaction! (sobbing) I don't want him in your room! I don't want him in this house! - Stop it! - You're just jealous. You're jealous of us! [Ann] Oh, baby, calm down. You're such a hypocrite! You say one thing to David, you say something else to me. You change your mind from one minute to the next! There's something wrong with that guy. Look at the way he sucked up to everybody. [Ann] Stay out of it. I was the one who brought him here. I just want to apologize. Go back to your room! [Hugh] Did you hear what I said? If you wanna play father, play father. If you say I can't see him, I won't. Just let me know-- Will you come in here and talk to your daughter, please? You're a hell of a doctor. She's hysterical. [Hugh] You encouraged this mess, not me! You handle it! I don't know what you want! He wants to destroy our love. We love each other! God damn it, I don't want him hanging around this house! She'll just see him in school. I'll drag her out of school. And you can go live with your uncle! You don't know what you're saying. Leave us alone. [Hugh] Damn, ever since that kid came in this house, I get nothing but back talk, back talk, back talk! (dog barking) [David] Morning, Hugh. Hi, Keith. Keith. David? I don't want you to go in the house. Why? What's the matter? You and Jade won't be seeing each other for a while. What? You heard what I said. This thing has gotten totally out of control. I made a mistake giving you so much freedom around here. Now Jade's fallen behind in her schoolwork, she can't sleep at night. Just a second. I mean, Jade didn't say anything to me about this. Well, I'm telling you. I want you to stay away until after school is out. 30 days. You can't do this. Don't you tell me what I can do and can't do. Jade is my daughter. She's only 15 years old. After 30 days, we'll take another look at the situation. Do you understand? Is she in there? Don't you go in that house. I'm going to talk to Jade. [Hugh] You get the hell outta here. No. I want you out! What the hell's going on? Hugh! I wanna talk to Jade. You'd better go talk to Mrs. Baxter. Return her call. She's called three times. I'll talk to David. David-- [David] I've got to talk to Jade. Hey. Do you trust me? Yes. Hugh has to do this. He's trying to break us up, that's what he's trying to do. He's trying to give us all a chance to catch our breath. You and Jade have pushed this too far. We're not a couple of little kids. You come out and you say you can't play together. We love each other. It's not fair. He say a month? 30 days. Fine, 30 days. It's not such a long time. You have finals, you have graduation. Jade has her exams. Oh, my God. I'm sounding like a mother. Don't inflict that on me, please. Just promise me. Give me your word. Don't make Hugh do something he'll regret, we'll all regret. This isn't going to change anything. You're part of our lives. (dramatic guitar music) (all chattering) [Girl] Jade. Jade! Hey, Bob, you gonna be at my party tonight? Is Jade gonna be there? Yeah, she'll be there. Of course she's gonna be there. Come on. [Bob] Yeah, I heard she's going with someone. No, she broke up with him. [Bob] Hey, I'm available. What time? You know our house, man. Anytime, whenever you want. Catch ya later. See you then. (all shouting) (whistle blowing) I have an idea. What do you say, so, we kidnap her? Say, a million in ransom. Shut up. Listen, if some woman did that to me, I'd burn her damn house down. Hey, I tried that. I ever tell you guys? Eight years old and I was into arson. You're full of it. No, I'm serious. I lit a whole pile of newspapers. You ever try to light a whole pile of wet newspapers? Geez, it smokes like crazy. I got real scared, see? Do you wanna hear the wild part? It's like I'm a hero. They thought I saved the whole block. (laughing) To this day, my mother thinks I'm a hero. (laughing) Hey, you better not tell her what I just told you. I'll see you later. [Man] Hey, where you goin'? David?

(knocking on door) The neighbors are gonna call the cops. ♪ Feel the magic ♪ It might wake him up to have to talk to the police. Too much self-dramatizing around here. I keep hoping he'll get that girl out of his system. It's none of our business. [Mom] It is our business! You should have heard what Margaret has to say about that household. Oh, Margaret. What goes on there. I wish she'd told me sooner, because if she had, I would have said something about those bums. Oh, he is not a baby. He can take care of himself. He can't take care of himself. He's in love with that girl. That house is the joke of the neighborhood. Into drugs, into everything. A relic of the '60s. Who the hell are you to even talk about them that way? You've never even met them. Well, thank God I haven't, because if I had-- You wouldn't understand them. Good or bad, at least they're a family. I mean, they talk to each other, they listen to one another. Oh, come on, knock it off, knock it off. They like to do things together. They're wonderful people. Here, the only people you listen to are your goddamn clients! Well, then, why don't you go live with them? Right? Obviously, anyone is better than your own family.

Is there anybody else? (dramatic orchestral music) [Man] Come on, come on, come on. Arson is one of the most grievous offenses to come before a court. Your client is guilty of arson by his own admission. He has been convicted of arson in the second degree. And it is within my power to sentence him to prison for as long as 20 years. In determining sentence, however, I must take into account the psychiatric evaluations of the defendant probation reports, the testimony of the boy's family, and I see grounds for some leniency in this case. I am sentencing him to five years' probation-- That's ridiculous. On the understanding that he enter a psychiatric facility approved by the court. Most ridiculous thing I ever heard in my life. That's supposed to be justice? [Judge] But let me emphasize that unless David wants to spend the balance of that time in prison, he will remain under treatment until his doctors can convince this court that he no longer presents a danger to himself or to others. Part of the condition will be that he may not attempt to contact any member of this family in any way in the future. (patient sobbing) [David] What is it, Leonard? Wanna talk about it? (sobbing) What's the matter? (sobbing) He's crying. Can't you sleep? I was asleep. [Nurse] I'll give you a pill. No. Then get back to bed. (sobbing) Come on, now. Come on, come on.

I never seem to find the time to write letters. Well, you should. It's really important, you know. Otherwise, a person could go crazy in a place like this. The doctors say you're making progress, David. I wanna get out of here. Your father and I are aware of that. They don't want to keep people here. They don't believe in that, they told me that, and they've shown me the figures. I wanna get out of here. I wanna come back home. Listen, am I paranoid? I got this idea that you two aren't getting along so well. Oh, Arthur and I? I said that to one of my doctors. Of course. You have to talk about family and things like that. They've gotta talk about something. It's pretty common. Families, uh, fall apart when the kid goes in the nuthouse. They blame each other. It's nothing like that. It has nothing to do with you. (sighing) How long have we been married, 25 years? So, we've had our ups and downs. You just never noticed it before. So what? Don't worry. You think about yourself. (all chattering) You. Come on, you're in this group today. Martin, let's go. [Martin] Gladly. John, come on. Damien. David, you have a 10 o'clock appointment to see Dr. Miller today. Will you tell him I'm studying, please? All right. But this is the fourth week in a row you've skipped therapy. David. David. (dramatic orchestral music) What would you do if I died? I'd die. I'd die, too. I don't ever wanna stop being with you. [Hugh] This thing is getting completely out of control. You and Jade are not going to see each other again. [David] He's trying to break us up. That's what he's trying to do. [Hugh] You get the hell out of my house! Jade. Jade! No! Stay with me! Jade, no! (dramatic orchestral music) Are there enough stamps? [Woman] Yes, this is enough postage. Is there any mail for me? [Woman] Mm-mm, no. Okay, thank you. Any mail for me? Mm-mm, no. Hey, John. Take this to Dr. Miller, please. Okay. Okay, Bob, today we're gonna do a little mirror therapy. So I want you to just come over to the mirror. Just relax and take it easy, and we're gonna work this up, okay? Now, whom do you see in the mirror? [Bob] Me. [Therapist] That's very good, very good. Now, just tell me, who is me? [Bob] I don't remember. [Therapist] Think carefully. Look in the mirror and tell me, who is me? What is your name? Bob. Very good, Bob, very good. Now, Bob, I want you to just touch your chin. Good. Now, whom are you touching? I'm touching me. Very good, very good. Now, let's go over here, and I want you to remember what you saw in the mirror, because what you saw was real. That was you in the mirror, Bob. That's right. (dramatic orchestral music) Jade! They're trying to make me crazy. They're trying to make me think I'm insane. I gotta get outta here. David, listen, the doctor said-- [David] Don't listen to the doctors, listen to me! Let me tell you what the doctor's saying. [David] Listen to me! You don't understand! You don't understand because you don't listen to me! You listen to them. You listen to the lawyers. For once in your life, God damn it, listen to me! Listen to your son. They're killing me. I'm dying. Get the fuck outta here, Leonard! Go on, leave us alone! Look! Look at him! You wanna take him home? Well, that's what you're gonna take home! You've got to get me out of here! Look, I'm holding on day by day. You don't know what one day is like here, and I've been here almost two years! Oh, God. (sobbing) You've got to get me out of here! We've got to do something about him. We've just got, we must. (phone ringing) Hello? Oh! Margo, we just arrived. That's why I'm so out of breath, yes. Yes, he's just fine. He's gonna be okay. (door slamming) No, well, you know, it, it's gonna be an adjustment, and I want him to be happy here. Arthur was magnificent. Completely convinced the doctors. Hmm? Oh, no, we don't have to worry about them, thank goodness. But he is only on probation. Well, he can't travel. He can't even get a driver's license, no. Oh, no, we are not going to argue the conditions. He can't leave Chicago, and that's that. Ah, don't worry. I want you to take it easy this weekend because as of Monday morning, you're going to be starting a whole new life. By the end of the week, you'll have a whole new set of friends. Ah, you'll see. We're all gonna help. Help what? We'll help you forget. I don't mean forget... I know there are some things you'll want to remember. I only saw her once. You were together on your bicycle, and she waved at me. I'll remember that picture for the rest of my life. But it's over, David. They've moved back East. New York, someplace. Anyway, that's the past. Nobody can ever take that away from you. But you can never bring it back. (light acoustic guitar music) I love her. David, you're in love with a girl who no longer exists. How do you know? David, in all this time, she's never called you. Never written you. Of course not. Those bastards, those bastards stopped my mail. How would she know what to think? She may think I hate her. David, for God's sake, let her go. No. I can't. No one ever thinks they can forget their first love. But we can. (dramatic orchestral music) I know because it happened to me. David, your mother and I are... Separation. About six weeks now. We'd been considering it for some time, but we didn't, didn't want you in the hospital thinking you didn't have a home to come back to. Her name is Barbara Sherwood. You never met her. I love her, David. I'll tell you something. Seeing you in love reminded me of what it's like, how it feels. Made me remember. I never thought I could believe in all this a second time, but I do. It can happen for you, too, David. That boy has never been punished! I knew when they sent him to this goddamn country club, they didn't understand that kid! Why wasn't I told about his release? I mean before, not afterwards. I was told my family would be protected. Whose decision was this, anyway? Was this your decision? He was punished by his stay here. [Hugh] Bullshit! [Doctor] We believe he's matured sufficiently to be able-- Matured? That's a lot of crap! He burned down my house. He tried to burn me and my family to death! Would you just calm down? What's gonna satisfy you, putting that boy in jail the rest of his life? Come on, Keith. I wanna tell you something, if that kid comes near me or anybody in my family ever again, I'll kill him. (doorbell buzzing) You know, I don't like surprises. And you won't stop surprising me. (sighing) I, I've been having so many visitors. Sammy has been camping out on the sofa. He went back to school this morning. This is nice, this place. The nouveau moi. Where should I sit? Assuming you should? Tell me if you want me to go. Still doing it? Still giving people permission to say what's on their mind? (sighing) What brings you to New York? You. I wanted to see you again. It's been a long time. Two years. Hugh predicted that you would find me and get in touch, and I should've been the hardest. Oh, damn him, he is clairvoyant sometimes. (sighing) Once we, uh, didn't have those old doors to slam, the quiet just went on and on. I'm paying for this one. It was fine. What were we talking about? Um, your divorce. Ah, my divorce, my happy divorce. Uh, Hugh is living in New Jersey with his girl at the moment. And they frequently come by the apartment. Hugh thinks that we should all be great friends. She sits in a corner and glares at me. She hates me, of course. She thinks I put him through hell. What do you think? Should I go to the wedding? When are they getting married? Who knows? She has the matrimonial glint in her eye. It'll be a great relief for everybody. My children will have a devoted stepmother. She fawns on them, Keith and Ingrid of great chums. What's her name? Ingrid? Ingrid Orchester. Citizen of Jupiter. She drives a van, believes in an astrological explanation for everything. (chuckling) She lives in the stars. You still want to be an astronomer? I'm sure she's right. There is such a thing as fate. I'm glad to hear that you're writing again. It's great. Tell me, that story you wrote about me, do you have a copy of it? I'd like to read it sometime. It isn't just about you. It's about you and Jade and me. It's about a time I saw the two of you making love. You saw us? I heard something. I thought there were robbers in the house. (chuckles) I was halfway down the stairs and I saw you, the two of you in the firelight. I was dazzled. I, I couldn't move. You never knew I was there, did you? No. (light orchestral music) And it changed everything that night. Everything that I believed about love, about my marriage. I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm talking about. And it feels good. Oh, come and sit next to me. I don't want to sit here all alone. I think that night, that night that I came down and saw you with Jade and then made love to my husband, I was making love to you. You know, they thought we were lovers, you and I. Did they? Maybe we should've done them a favor of making them right. It's so nice to be here. I missed you. It was a long time. The only things that I regret and the only things I'll ever regret are things I didn't do. In the end, that's what we mourn, the paths we didn't take. People we didn't touch. I should be angry. I know it's difficult to understand, but I can't make love to anybody but Jade. It's just the way I feel. (sighs) I'd better go. Where are you staying? I don't know. It's late, and you don't know your way around. [David] Well, I saw a place near the bus terminal called The Ivanhoe. Oh, my. You don't know your way around, do you? That area's too rough at this time of night. You better stay here. You can sleep on the sofa. My kids do all the time. You have to let yourself out in the morning and get breakfast elsewhere. Call me tomorrow, David. For heaven's sake, don't drop by. Hugh and Ingrid have a way of turning up on Saturdays. David? Did you hear what I said? What time's the next bus to Burlington, Vermont? Burlington, Vermont. 2:30? Thank you, thank you. (car horns honking) (whistle blowing) [Woman] Taxi. [Man] Taxi. (whistle blowing) (tires screeching) (woman screaming) (clamoring) Hugh! What happened? What happened to him? (sobbing) Help. Help him. Help. Help him, please. (siren wailing) No! (sobbing) [Bus Driver] Anybody else for Burlington? (doorbell buzzing) (footsteps thudding) (sobbing) Hugh was hit by a car. This afternoon. He, uh, and he's dead. Ann. Killed. Dead on arrival. He never knew what happened. [Ingrid] I will. Is that Sammy? Who's that? Ingrid, this is David. Our friend, David. This is Ingrid Orchester, Hugh's friend. What the hell is he doing here? David was in town. He came to see me, Keith. I don't understand this. Did she tell you? My father's dead. I wanna talk to you, Keith. We used to be good friends. This has nothing to do with you, so don't push in now. First of all, you don't give a damn about my father. That's not true. I loved your father. He saved my life. You came here looking for my sister. Well, my sister doesn't want to see you. My sister hates you! So you can stop looking for her. Don't you understand? Jade hates you! Hush! I can't, David, can't you stay? You don't have to go back. Find a hotel. [David] Ann, it doesn't matter anymore. Let me, no, don't listen to Keith. Go to that hotel, the Ivanhoe. I'll tell Jade. The thing that's so weird is that I didn't even see it happen. Oh, for God's sake! That is the way Hugh was. He was so damned arrogant. He even had to have his way at a stop-light. He was so stupid. I'm sorry. But I should know. It isn't fair. Ann, I just want to understand what happened. You've been saying that all afternoon, Ingrid. I'm sorry, but she makes me so angry, I could spit. Ann, will you give these to Jade? She's trying to be as difficult, what? She may not wanna see me anymore. [Ann] What do you mean? Please make sure she gets them. They wouldn't let me mail them. [Ann] David. (dramatic orchestral music) (knocking on door) Well? He's not there. He's not anywhere. His note said that he'd be back on Sunday. (door clicking) He's in some sort of trouble. I'm terribly afraid. So am I. (knocking on door) (dramatic orchestral music) I was on my way to the bus station. And I wanted to talk to you. May I come in? I heard about you and Keith. What he said. It wasn't fair. He said you hate me. Is it true? I don't hate you, David. You shouldn't be here. I know you're still on parole. I don't want you to be in any more trouble because of me. I had to see you again. I haven't changed. I love you. I don't deserve it. I never wrote you. I never even called your family. I probably wouldn't have gotten your letters, anyway. I got yours. Ann gave them to me. I read all of them. I felt like I ruined your life. (sighing) We can talk about that sometime. I can't handle it now. There won't be any sometime. It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing, David. I know that. And it came at a time when we were both too young to handle it. That was the terrible part. (Jade sobbing) Jade? I had to say good-bye to my father. I never thought I could do that. I'll be all right. [David] Where are you going? [Jade] Back to school. It's in Burlington. That's up in Vermont. My bus leaves in an hour. (bag zipper zipping) Don't go. Stay. I don't know when we'll see each other again. I can't. I really must go. Good-bye, David. You have to let it go. (dramatic orchestral music) Go back to Chicago. Please take care of yourself. Please say good-bye. (sobbing) Please, please. No. No. Jade! [Jade] No, David! [David] Please stay with me! [Jade] Please let me go! [David] I don't care what happens to me, Jade! All I care about is you! [Jade] Please, no, no. Can't you see? I can't let go. It's not over! We're not finished. It won't work. David, it's all over. Look at me, look at me. Jade, we're not finished. No! I know you still love me! (sobbing) (light orchestral music) David. David, look at me. David, look at me. You, you're right. You're right. I love you. It'll be weird going back to Chicago. Do you ever go by the house? I thought about it. I'm glad I'll be going back with you. It'll mean it's all over. Maybe like it never even happened. It happened. What? Nothing. Come on. Yeah, what room is David Axelrod in? David Axelrod. Yeah. David, it's Keith. Yeah, I'm in the lobby. You wanna come downstairs a moment, please? Tell Jade to come with you. They'll be downstairs in just a minute. Now, look, you tell Jade exactly what you told me. Keith, I told you I wasn't sure. I don't want to do this. Oh, come on. I know it's him. Look, it all makes sense. Keith, I wanna know what happened just as much as you do, but I want to be fair about it. [Man] All right, sir, I don't see the name Shapiro listed here. Could it have been some other, another name? Perhaps in your wife's name? Ingrid. It was him. You were right there. What? [Ingrid] You were standing right there, and I touched you. What? Jade, do you think this was some sort of coincidence? What are you talking about? [Keith] He was in town, and your father was killed. I know. You think this was coincidence. [Ingrid] Jade, he was standing right there. Ingrid saw him there. She saw him. This bastard was standing right there. That's why Pap ran out like... Pappy's dead because of him. No! He killed your father! David. I was there. It was an accident. Jade, listen to me. Let me explain. [Keith] Get your goddamn hands off her! Jade, it was an accident. Jade-- You goddamn son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill you! Jade, let me tell you what happened! I didn't do anything. (all shouting) You dirty bastard, I'll kill you! You killed my father! Keith, it wasn't his fault! [Man] Step aside. Step aside, police, police. (all shouting) [Woman] Somebody get him off of him. Let go of me! That bastard burned down my house, for God's sakes! He's on fucking parole! (all shouting) [Jade] Stop him! Damn you, let me go! (sobbing) Jade! [Jade] Don't hurt him! Jade! Jade! (grunting) (screaming) (all shouting) Jade! [Man] Go on, boy! [David] Jade! (all shouting) [Jade] You know what I keep thinking about? The night at the house. Pappy played the trumpet that night. [Ann] Yeah, and I was with him. I was his little girl. And then I saw David all alone. And I don't know, I just, I wanted to go to him. Was it wrong? No. I wasn't Pappy's little girl anymore. Something had changed. For the first time in my life, I was me. Life goes on. We change. (dramatic orchestral music) [Jade] But I hurt. I hurt so much. Oh, baby. It all happened so fast for you. But you'll, you'll have a lifetime to understand it. (sighing) But he loved me. He loves me. No one will ever love me like that. You'll always be loved. You'll see. Not like that. Not like David. Not like David. I can't help you very much. I wish I could. But you deserve-- What? Anything. Everything. You have to find out for yourself.
