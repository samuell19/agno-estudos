"Every epoch dreams its successor." Jules Michelet (Duke Red) At this moment, we, as a nation, are about to touch the stars. I tremble at the honour of announcing the culmination of mankind's long history of intellectual and scientific achievement. Yesterday our power spanned the earth. Today it can illuminate the heavens. May it stand forever, our Ziggurat! (♪ Jazz band plays) (Cheering) (Cheering and applause) These robots have become unmanageable and insolent. It's just outrageous! Let's accept the facts. We need robots for our economy. But the human workers resent them and that makes trouble for everyone. I'll have you know, an enemy nation is creating a secret weapon. Metropolis needs a strong leader who's not afraid to take charge and put things in order. All right, gentlemen, this is it. (Applause) (Journalist) Duke Red, now the Ziggurat's complete, will you be going into politics? Don't be ridiculous! As long as President Boone here is in charge, our state is secure. I'm just a private citizen. Politics has no need of me, I assure you. (Journalist) Mr President, don't you want Duke Red in politics? You really shouldn't egg him on like that. We all know no one can compete with the Duke for popularity. (Applause) There have been persistent rumours that the Ziggurat is a military facility. Any truth to that? How about it? Can we get a comment from Mayor Lyon on this one? You can address such questions to Skunk, the Minister of State. (Crowd) Hurray for the Ziggurat! Long live Metropolis! Hurray for the Ziggurat! Long live Metropolis! Uncle Shinsaku? I've never heard of a Ziggurat before. - What does it mean? - Who knows? Hey, look at that image on the wall up there! Oh, yeah. I see it. - Huh? - Marduks! - It's their sign. - Eh? Ah! Doesn't even look good. (Guard) There he is, over there. (Crowd gasps) (Gunshot) (Crowd) Oh! Huh? Oh! (Rock) You're outside of your zone. You should know better than that. Hm, I see, I see. - (Clears throat) Eh? - (Door opening) (Door creaking) (Sighs) You said that she would be ready tonight, Dr Laughton. - Tonight. - Ah, yes, but, er... I have provided you with advanced equipment and all the money you requested, and now I want an answer. If you could give me a little more time. She's almost finished now, I swear it. I'm tired of hearing the same excuse. I'm coming to your lab tomorrow night. No discussion. You don't want to go there. An important man like yourself, it's hardly worth your time. Besides, the place is a mess. I will see you tomorrow night! (Muttering) It's Rock. I heard there was a problem in the main plaza. Yes, a robot agitator tried to make trouble. I put you in charge of security to prevent that kind of thing. Yes, Father. You idiot! I am not your father. Understand? I found you during the last war. You were an orphan so I took you in. - You're dismissed. - Yes. (Police radio) 'Accident, District 45. 'All squad cars in the vicinity please proceed to the site immediately.' 'Unit three currently in pursuit of a marked robot 'believed to be out of his zone. 'I need backup. Please take precautions. He may be armed.' 'Headquarters, this is unit eight. Repeat: unit eight.' I'm from Japan. My name is Shinsaku Ban. I'm a private detective. I have a letter of introduction from the Police Commissioner, so if you can direct me to Superintendent Notarlin. Oh, I see. Yes, so, what you're saying is, this character, this Dr Laughton, he's hiding out, so to speak. Let's see. Here in Metropolis, that is. Is that right? Hm? (Shinsaku clears his throat) Exactly. I have a reliable tip from an organ smuggler who has had dealings with him. The International Human Rights Committee and seven other human rights groups have issued warrants for his arrest. The charges include conducting illegal vivisection experiments on animals and the smuggling and trafficking of human organs. That's why I'm asking for your cooperation in this investigation. Um, I've never been to Metropolis before, and I can't tell which way is which half the time. It's rather confu... Oh! Of course, I'd like to help you, but these celebrations for the Ziggurat are going on all week long. We've had a rash of crimes break out and we're struggling to keep things under control. It's not easy, I assure you. I'm using all the personnel I have. Er, I'm afraid I just don't have anyone. I could give you a robot if you're all right with that. - I think that's the best answer. - A robot? Huh? Yes, a robot. It's quite a good one actually. It's not authorised to arrest humans of course, nothing like that, but it's programmed for investigative work, so it should be useful to you, in its way. (Shinsaku) Am I supposed to return it with a full tank or something? (Officer) I wouldn't worry about it. It needs refuelling every five years. Pretty soon they won't even need humans anymore. I'm Kenichi. How do you do? My serial number is 803DRP-DM4973C. Nice to meet you. My pleasure. (Duke Red) 'May it stand forever, our Ziggurat!' (Woman) 'Metropolis is the world leader in industry, economics and culture. 'Thus is born an ascendant state that will last a thousand years. 'Metropolis is the future. 'Metropolis is the world leader in industry, economics and culture.' (Duke Red) 'I tremble at the honour of announcing 'the culmination of mankind's long history 'of intellectual and scientific achievement. 'Yesterday our power spanned the earth. 'Today it can illuminate the heavens. 'May it stand forever, our Ziggurat!' (Woman) 'Metropolis is the world leader in industry, economics and culture. 'Thus is born an ascendant state...' So, where do you think we should start looking, er, 803... - What was it? - DRP-DM4973C. Listen here, don't you have an easier name? We are not allowed human names. It's considered inappropriate for a robot. They feel it would infringe upon the rights of humans. (Shinsaku) I know all about that, but come on, numbers? Oh, I know! Starting now, your name is Pero. Hey, that's a dog's name, isn't it? That's right. I used to have a dog named Pero a while back. He was a good dog too. (Pero) In my opinion, you won't find your criminal in Metropolis. There's no place to hide here. It's too tightly controlled. (Shinsaku) But I have reliable information that places him here. (Pero) If Dr Laughton was looking for a place to hide, he wouldn't come here, he'd go to Zone-1. - What's Zone-1? - It's underground. Ah! You are a detective. Intuition, eh? My neuro-simulator is simply crunching the numbers. - It's a matter of probability. - Huh? - (Gunshot) - (Gasps) (Man) Look out! (Shouting and screaming) (Pero) We robots are assigned to specific zones, based on occupation. We are strictly forbidden to operate outside of our areas. That robot was not authorised to work at surface level. He's supposed to be underground. (Shinsaku) But who are those guys? They look like fascists? (Pero) The Marduk. They were a political party, but evolved into a kind of vigilante group to calm anti-robot sentiment. Today their main occupation is terminating robots which are malfunctioning or breaking the law. Excuse the inconvenience, it'll be a few moments. Metropolis is a city of levels with tight transit controls. I have police clearance, but most robots are marked with a zone code. - They're not allowed to surface. - So that robot had a mark? That's correct, young man. Each block has a gate like this, but there are also secret passages and certain smugglers who can take you through them, so such incidents are bound to happen. (Shinsaku) Of course they are. Shadow and light. Yes. You can't have light without shadows. That's the way it is. This level is not dangerous per se, but there are areas, certain districts, where we police have little authority. We're going into one now, so be aware of your surroundings and watch your backs. Now we're getting somewhere. We didn't come here as tourists. We've got work to do. Whoa! (Man grunting) (Man) Hey, it's been a while. Come on over. What you been up to? (Woman) Hey, where are you? (Overlapping conversations) Duke Red, you're here. Show me now, Laughton. She looks perfect. Are you sure she's not finished yet? Well, the final settings for her fuel management system are unstable, so... They say your specialty is mixing real organs with synthetic. Oh, no, no. That's absolutely illegal. I never use human body parts. They don't last very long anyway. Quick fix at best. She is 100% synthetic. Much better. Every component made by hand. She is a masterpiece, the culmination of my life's work. - And when will you be done with her? - By the end of the week. If I try to activate her any sooner than that, the fuel cells might overload and that could spell disaster. She could literally blow up, boom, just like that. (Duke Red) My little Tima. (Muttering) "Is she finished yet? Do you use human organs?" Ridiculous, putting them in charge of the world! I'm not giving you to anyone. No, not a chance. I'll put the finishing touches on now. Then we'll escape together and leave Metropolis far behind. I know you, you're Rock. How did you find my laboratory? I followed my father here. It's my duty to protect him from danger. Your father? Duke Red doesn't have any children. Everyone knows that. He had a daughter, but she died when she was very young. Just shut up! I know what you're trying to get away with here. No scheming old parasite like you is going to deceive my father. And no mechanical puppet is going to steal my father's heart. - Wait, what are you doing? - (Gun clicks) I created Tima at Duke Red's request. It's not what you think. He has plans for her. The final piece to complete the Ziggurat. Please, you don't know what you're doing. He's going to place her on the throne. That's a lie. Father would never do that, have a machine rule the Ziggurat. - It's absurd. - Ask him yourself. She's modelled after his own child. You're going to shoot her? The man you call Father is waiting for her, waiting for his little angel. I won't allow it. I won't allow my father to be fooled by a robot. (Gun clicks) No, don't! Aargh! (Gunshot) 'Oh gods, give me courage. 'Give me the strength to protect my father 'from the evil of machines.' (Explosion) (Sirens wailing) Fire! There's a fire! The whole place is burning down! What? Huh? A Marduk started the fire. I saw him, I'm telling you. I saw him! The Marduks don't care about us. They're trying to burn us to death. Yeah. Atlas is right and we all know it. It's enough already. They treat us like garbage. I say we get weapons, fight fire with fire. Yeah! Everyone, please remain calm. Firefighters are on their way to take care of this. Huh? It is dangerous here. Please evacuate the area. We don't need a robot to butt into our business here. We lost our jobs to you bastards. You do what they programme you to do, including trying to kill us. You fool! This is no time to argue. Huh? (Shrieking) Huh? (Man) Hey, Atlas, it doesn't make any sense. Why would the Marduks burn down an abandoned factory? - They hunt down robots. - (Atlas) Who knows? There was an old guy who went in and out of that place. - Maybe that had something to do with it. - (Shinsaku) Old guy? Is this the man you saw? Look carefully. - Yes, that's him. - Ah, thank you. (Grunting) Oh! Uncle, there's someone inside! Oh, you're right. Hey, see if you can get in from the back. - OK. - Hurry, and be careful. Aargh! Aaaaargh! Huh? (Groaning) (Gasping) (Groaning) Come on, Laughton. My notebook! You want that notebook? What do you want it for? Laughton! (Crashing) (Screaming) (Duke Red) What? Laughton's lab burned down? (Rock) Apparently, he was doing unauthorised experiments. It wasn't an ordinary fire. It ripped through the whole district. (Duke Red) What about him? (Rock) They found his corpse. Only the charred, skeletal remains. There were several international arrest warrants out for him, so, whatever he was doing there, it was a danger to the state. Now that danger has been eliminated. - (Duke Red gasps) - What's wrong, Father? Did you have dealings with Laughton? He was not to be trusted. Just shut up and get out! I need to be alone. (Groaning) Where are we? (Chuckling) Coo-wee! Man, that was some fire! But it was just an old factory. No great loss. - Saves us the trouble of tearing it down. - That's right. 'Somethings wrong. That robot was extremely advanced. 'No matter how bad the fire was, 'a metallic skeleton should have been found, or something.' (Laughing) - (Shinsaku) Pero, who is that? - His name's Rock. He's a Marduk. Don't let his age fool you. He's young but very powerful. He's Duke Red's right-hand man. (Shinsaku) Really? Duke Red? Is he part of this Marduk thing? What does he want with those thugs? Duke Red founded the Marduk Party. It's his group. Of course there are no official ties, nothing traceable, but he puts up the money for all of their operations. It's what you call a public secret. Everyone knows about it. That sewage must go somewhere. What's this line connected to? It merges with the sewage lines from Zone-2 up ahead. Then it ends up at a waste treatment facility in Zone-3. No one would get that far and if they did, they'd be chopped up and liquefied with the organic waste. If they were a normal human. No matter what, a criminal always returns to the scene of the crime. OK, it's an old saying, but I like old sayings. If you're rested, we should continue our search for your nephew now. Who are you? Who are you? No, listen, when you're talking about yourself, you say "I". That's how it works. So, I am who? Hmm, say "I am..." You are I. No, listen. You are I, I am you. Er... huh? I am who? Right, right. I'm Kenichi. See how it works? Ken-ichi. Kenichi. Uh-huh. It's OK, take your time. I'm sure it will all come to you after a while. Your name, your home, your mother and father. Home, father. (Beep) (Robotic footsteps) Thanks. That's really nice. It's kind of you to bring us food. But this is rotten. It's not good food to eat. - Food to eat. - That's right. You do this. That's how you eat it. Oh, no, don't eat that. You're only supposed to eat fresh food. Rotten food can make you sick. No, don't eat, make you sick. (Tannoy) 'Don't disengage from the main control centre.' 'Atmospheric comm cover: 1.1. Prepare to proceed with experiment.' 'Magnetic deviation error: 3.7. Adjusting line.' - 'Initiating cooling procedure.' - 'Opening dome.' 'Time remaining to ignition: 40, 39...' 'Power system, cooling system, sensor system.' 'Observation Team to Control. Receiving and relaying city imaging.' (Whirring of machines over announcements) 'Magnetic heartbeat. Deviation margin: 025.' 'Optical target bias: 1.06.' 'Radiation mechanism, final position.' (Ponkotsu) We'll irradiate the surface for three minutes. There will be no impact on humans, but robots working at surface level may exhibit erratic performance. Well, it's only a trial run. The data will be of considerable value. Start at Level-3 and monitor very closely. Right, I understand. Commencing irradiation. (Tannoy) 'Radiation output will terminate in 180 seconds.' 'We will reach point R in five seconds.' 'Prepare for fusion reaction. Commencing countdown. 'Four seconds, three seconds, two seconds, one second.' 'Omotenium fusion achieved.' (Overlapping announcements) 'Power level steady. Cooling system steady. 'Sensor system adjusting to 0.12.' - 'Sunspot density: 800 and rising.' - 'All systems at full capacity.' 'Ionospheric interference. Communication disrupted.' (Shouting and screaming) 'Level-3, irradiation complete. 'Central control, system disengaged.' (Ponkotsu) Excellent, a resounding success! People will be in an uproar about this but that's how it is. You now hold the power of the gods in the palm of your hand. That is progress. (Explosion) If only Dr Laughton had finished building Tima, she now could've taken the throne. (Skunk) 'It's a new weapon, Mr President. Revolutionary. 'It creates sunspots which bathe the earth in electromagnetic radiation. 'At higher levels, it could change the balance of power.' (Boone) 'Hmm. Without consulting our military leaders? 'What recklessness! 'He's compromised national security. It's completely outrageous!' (Skunk) I agree with you, sir. Even with Marduks gunning down malfunctioning robots... ...the rebels will say it's proof robots endanger humans and call for changes to robot law. They're going to stir up everything. Even pro-robot groups are worried, and they're already organising protests in the streets. Fighting is breaking out and it's only going to get worse. What do you think? This is a golden opportunity, Mr President. We can make a case for treason and get rid of this problem once and for all. (Chuckles) Will the military support us? Some units are leaning toward Duke Red, but I can handle them. You don't have to worry about a thing, Mr President. (Boone) All right, so we'll leak stories to the press. That'll turn the focus of the public on Duke Red. When there's enough resentment built up against him, we'll arrest him for treason. If that requires the military, you have my approval. Understood? (Shinsaku) I have a pretty strong hunch he's the one who took out Laughton. I don't get the connection, though. If I knew what kind of project Laughton was working on... He always had some twisted experiment going, but what was it this time? (Pero) So what do you plan to do now? (Shinsaku) Laughton's dead. I want to at least know why. I owe my client that much. It's a matter of professional pride. Hello. (Shinsaku clears his throat) Where's he going now? (Pero) Zone-2. (Shinsaku) There's another level below this? How far down does this place go? Zone-2 is the area for power plants. It handles Metropolis' energy production. Zone-3 below that is the sewage treatment facility. There's only robots working down there. Sewage treatment, huh? Right. You remember Rock was checking out the drainage system behind that factory? Wait here. I'll return to headquarters to file a missing person's report, to allow us to enter the lower levels to search for your nephew. Mm. I agree. Hey, you! A little old for petty theft, aren't you? How much is it? (Worker) Sure, if there was someone wandering around down there, we'd know about it immediately. The administration keeps close tabs. - So, how often do you come down here? - Twice a week, usually. For robot inspection and general maintenance. These are the Albert II models. It's their last check this week. They're very durable so they get a lot of use. Is anybody here? Hey! You never get used to the stench here, no matter how many times you come. Eurgh! A human wouldn't last a day working one of these jobs. - Huh? - What is it? - Someone's down there. - Nah, no way. Hey-hey! What are you doing there? You! This is a restricted area! - So, she's still alive. - Eh? Hello! - (Gun clicks) - (Gasps) What are you doing with that? They're criminals. It's necessary. Hey, down here! Don't do that. You'll hit the equipment. You could do a lot of damage. (Gunshot) (Screaming) - (Gasping) - (Gunshots) Are you OK? What do we do? He's... he's trying to kill us. Move! Move! Get out of the way! You piece of junk! Move! Damn! (Kenichi) Is it all right now? It should be OK if we're careful. (whimpering) Huh? What's the matter? Oh. I see. This is Zone-2. Fifi can't go through here. Thanks for everything, Fifi. We'll see you again. Ow! Move! There he is! (Gunshot) Fifi! No firearms are allowed in this area. Let's see your identification? I'm a Marduk. I'm Rock, you idiot! (Crowd chanting) Power to the people! (Tannoy) 'Demonstrations are prohibited during celebration week. 'Please disperse immediately.' Huh? Kenichi? 'Demonstrations are prohibited...' Wait, Kenichi! Aargh! Pay up, buddy! Here, Harvey got some good stuff. Just try it. Give it a taste. (Whooping) Stop! Hey, you! Aargh! (Screaming) - Did you find 'em? - No. How about over there? - Not here. - Well, let's keep checking. - They aren't here. - That's not an acceptable answer. - Cover the whole area! - Understood. - Sure. - Let's split up. Let's split up! (Kenichi panting) (Sighing and groaning) - (Rock) Search over that way! - Yes, sir. (Music blares out) - Huh? Do you hear that? - Shh, listen, listen. (Music stops) Hey, Atlas, everyone's been waiting for your signal. Not today. There are Marduks everywhere. Why? What's up? Have we been ratted out? - No, apparently they're looking for them. - Huh? Rock is searching for them personally. Come on, you two! I remember that kid. He was at the fire when the old factory burned down, right? Uh-huh. (Rats squeaking) (Atlas) What are your names? Where are you from? I'm Kenichi from Japan. I came with my uncle. He's a private inv... - A private what? - I mean, he's a newspaper reporter. I help him, you know, like an assistant. That's why he brought me. Why is Rock looking for you? I don't know, really. He just started shooting at us. We don't have any idea why. They're lying. Let's just kill 'em. Let's just not kill 'em. We aren't a street gang. We're building a movement. You heard him, guys. The kid's an assistant news reporter. He'll help us get some good stories in the press, let the world know how we're treated in Metropolis, tell them we're just trying to get a fair deal. This is no time for genteel newspaper articles with our pictures in fancy uniforms. This is life and death. Yes, and the uniform that I'm going to die in... ...is the uniform of the revolution that will change this world. (♪ "Saint James Infirmary Blues") ♪ I went down to Saint James Infirmary ♪ I saw my baby there ♪ She was stretched out on a long white table... | (Man) Look at that! (Woman) She looks heavenly. (Girl) Yes, like an angel. (Atlas) Look around. These people live two or three families per room. No schools, no jobs. They used to dole out food rations, but... with these celebrations for the Ziggurat, even that has stopped. There's absolutely nothing left for us now. What does "Ziggurat" mean? It's a kind of tower they built in the ancient city of Babylon to show everyone how powerful they were. The Tower of Babel is the most famous. Everyone knows what happened to that. The king's arrogance angered the gods so they smote him down and destroyed the tower. 'History repeats itself. 'The same thing will happen to Duke Red and his Marduks. 'But this time it won't be the gods who will bring about the change. 'It'll be us.' Huh? Oh. Eh? Oh? Did I do it wrong? No, you did it right. I was just thinking how your hair looked different today. Kenichi, what kind of hair do you like? Huh? Er.. I think your hair looks just fine. Hmm.. Er, why don't we get back to your writing? I think we're on... - Tima. - What? Tima. That's what my name is. Oh. So you're... Good, you're starting to remember. That's great, Tima. You just wait. Soon everything will start to come back to you. You really think so... Kenichi? Er... oh... Hmm. Oh, I got this for you. I mean, I borrowed this from Atlas. I almost forgot. Kenichi, look. Huh? (Both laugh) So the army will support us? That's good. We're gonna need 'em. Underground residents are in favour of an uprising, but they're hesitant. Many aren't sure we've got the strength to win. What are you worried about? That's why this is your best chance. The time's now. Everything's been arranged. The Marduk parade is the final event of the Ziggurat celebration. You can crush them and storm the Ziggurat. You'll be heroes. President Boone will make a statement announcing the arrest of Duke Red for treason. Then it'll be a simple matter of invoking the right of command to place the military under President Boone's control. The Duke will be powerless and the rule of law will prevail. I guarantee it. After years of hiding, our day in the light has finally come. Our party will get the recognition it deserves. Don't worry, Atlas. It's all been taken care of. The President will welcome you with open arms, exactly as he should. (Shinsaku) Ah, the things I get myself into. I finally find that kid and look what happens. He disappears again. (Pero) I am sorry for not serving you better at such an important time. (Shinsaku) What? You've been lots of help. I wouldn't know east from west in this city if it weren't for you. And don't worry yourself about Kenichi. He may be small, but he's a lot tougher than he... - (Crash) - Huh? (Grunting) (Shinsaku) Hey! What are you doing? Stop that. (Shinsaku sighs) Why would someone do this? (Muffled) Look out. You must be careful. All robots must perish. All robots must perish. All robots must perish. It's a revolution. A revolution. It's a revolution. We have to be careful. All robots must hide themselves now. A revolution is at hand. What do you say? Revolution? Oh. Oh, I'm getting too old for this. (Panting) (Crowd shouting) (Grunting and groaning) (Atlas) Listen and watch closely, Kenichi. Take a good look around you. I want you to tell the world about what we're fighting for. Oh! We'd better get out of here soon, Pero. I don't think we can do anything here by ourselves. Call headquarters and ask for backup. Are you crazy? I can't leave you here alone. Listen to me. Those people are going to attack robots first. They don't care what your position is. - I'll be fine. Go for backup. - Huh? Hmm. You must understand that part of my programming is to ensure the safety of all who visit this great city of Metropolis. Just do me a favour, will you? Try not to stir anything up until I get back. Tell me, robot, do you really think you can guard this gate all by yourself? Demonstrations are strictly forbidden during the week of celebration. Please disperse immediately. Sorry, but we can't do that. This is our time now. Why must humanity always resort to violence as the only means of settling their differences? There's no simple answer to that question. I agree that we're a violent race, controlled by emotions at war within us. We can do nothing but move in search for peace through destruction. If we deny their existence, then we cannot survive. Without emotions, then we are nothing. (Gunshot) Mr President, it's time. The uprising has begun. Do we want to release a formal statement or should we wait? We'll have a clearer idea of the situation by one o'clock, so I think 3:00 or 3:30 should be fine? Well? What is it, Minister? Are you too excited to relax? Oh, I am, Mr President, yes. You see, I have a very unpleasant duty to perform. Wait! Traitor! You've gone to the other side! Perhaps a traitor to you, Mr President, but not to history. (Gunshot) Wait, wait! I can explain. (Groaning) (Shouting and screaming) (Tima) Why? How can humans so easily destroy robots, Kenichi? They call this a revolution? (Tannoy) 'Attention. The revolution has failed. 'Martial law is now in effect at the command of Duke Red. 'Abandon your weapons and surrender immediately. 'I repeat: the revolution has failed. 'Martial law is now in effect under the command of Duke Red. 'Abandon your weapons and surrender immediately.' (Shinsaku) Kenichi! Hey, Kenichi! Uncle Shinsaku! You're safe. Thank goodness! I thought I'd never see you again. You've been hurt. Are you all right? What, this? Oh, it's nothing. Huh? Oh, who's this? (Chuckles) Er... oh, this is Tima, Uncle. She and I got out of that laboratory fire together. Hm? Tima, I want you to meet someone. This is my uncle. Your uncle. (Grunting and groaning) Atlas! It was... It was a trap. They fooled us. So, we meet at last. Don't move! Don't give me any trouble. Just give me what I want. Hand over the girl, no questions asked, then I'll let you go home alive. Don't make promises you can't keep, Rock. I know you better than that. (Gunshot) Aaaargh! So, you wanna fight? Tima, go get the gun! - (Thwack) - (Groan) Well done. And now, just hand over the gun. (Shinsaku) No. Don't give it to him. Go ahead, shoot if you can. I'm a human being, don't forget. - (Duke Red) Rock! - Huh? What is going on here? What's the meaning of this? I'm amazed that you haven't... Tima! You survived? Rock! I demand an answer now. When Dr Laughton's laboratory was destroyed, you told me that no one survived the fire. And just how do you know about Tima? She was classified. Answer! With all due respect, Father, please understand. You are the only one who should sit upon the throne of power. You must never allow a mere robot to control the Ziggurat and rule the city of Metropolis. - (Duke Red) You fool! - (Thwack) A robot? Do you really think you can manipulate me? You repay my kindness with nothing but impudence. Get up. Get out of here. I don't want to see you again. Kenichi! So, I understand now. You're the one who hired Dr Laughton. What concern of that is yours? Well, I came here from Japan to arrest him for human rights violations. I'm Detective Shinsaku Ban. (Groaning) Get in. Don't be afraid. What about Kenichi? Later, after business. (Shinsaku) I'm here to see Superintendent Notarlin. (Officer) He's been transferred. His replacement hasn't been named yet. Then maybe you can help me. You see, there's been a mistake. - The Marduks have taken my nephew... - Old man! You know the procedure. Handle it through your own embassy. Yeah, er... (Door opens and closes) (Duke Red) 'At this moment, we, as a nation, 'are about to touch the stars. 'I tremble at the honour of announcing 'the culmination of mankind's long history 'of intellectual and scientific achievement. 'Yesterday our power spanned the earth.' Sake. And make it hot. Well, the best I can do for a Japanese detective is either hot gin or hot whisky. Then hot whisky. Make it a double. You got it. Who really gives a damn about the Ziggurat anyway? All those Marduks can go to hell for all I care. All of them! Here you are. Hey, check it out. That was Rock back there. Yeah? I heard he quit the party. Never thought he'd be wandering around down here. (Shinsaku) Thanks for the drink. (Barman) Anytime. What? (Gasps) I, er... A man came by earlier. He asked me to give this note to Miss Tima. I told him no, but he said it was very important that Duke Red not find out about it. Some kind of secret I guess. I almost sent him away. He said his name was Kenichi. I thought you would want this. "Tima, I'm sorry that I can't deliver this in person, "but I'm in no condition to move around. "I have to leave the country soon "and would like to see you just one more time." Kenichi! (Gasps) I don't understand what's going on, Enmy. I'm trusting you to bring her back as soon as you are done. You have no idea how much trouble I'll be in, if they ever find out. Just relax. This won't take long. I didn't want to do this, you know. I have to get back. You tricked me. I had to. You never would have talked to me otherwise. Do you know where Kenichi is? If you do, you have to take me to him. (Gasping) It's uncanny. I'd never guess you were a robot. Your resemblance to a human is really amazing. Your hair, your skin, the craftsmanship, it's almost perfect. I guess my dad truly knows how to choose a mad scientist, because that Dr Laughton was a real find. Scientist? What are you talking about? Well, you being a robot and everything. I'm not. I'm not a robot. That's not true at all. Really? So what are you, then? A human? Well, if you are a human, who's your father? My father is... Kenichi. (Rock chuckles) (Laughs hysterically) How can he think a puppet like you is a superhuman? (Laughter) (Tima) If you can't take me to Kenichi, then I'm going. - What? Tima's gone? - Yes, sir! Hey, watch where you're going! (Chuckling) Don't worry, I just want a closer look at what my father is so obsessed with. You don't mind, do you? (Gasps) - (Thud) - Oh! (Groans) (Shinsaku) 'Come on, Laughton!' (Laughton) 'My notebook.' (Shinsaku) 'You want that notebook? What do you want it for?' Er, don't worry, you're safe. I taught that Rock a lesson he won't soon forget. Where is Kenichi? Er, well, to be honest, I'm not really sure. The only way I'm going to find him is if you help me. Help you? I've got this feeling he's locked up somewhere inside that behemoth, the Ziggurat. And by accessing the Ziggurat's mainframe data network, I'm hoping that you can help pinpoint Kenichi's location. Can I really do all that? OK, just hold out your hand. (Tima) 'Kenichi!' (Gasps) Well? I know where Kenichi is. He's in the tower. I knew it all the time. He had to be in there. (Tima) What just happened to me? I see. So you don't have any idea of who you are? What do you mean? Hmm. Sir, we're receiving a signal and tracing it now. Duke Red, huh? Yeah. Any luck yet? We should be able to trace the origin of the signal by locating where the splitters burned out. It's the most likely point of entry. - Got it. - What's the location? Zone-1, South Block 17, at the Hotel Coconut. I have to know, please. Am I a human of flesh and blood or not? Well, you're different. You're not like other robots. You're special. No, I am a human. I know I am, just like Kenichi. Er, well, yes, of course, just like Kenichi. At any rate, we'd better go if we're going to find him. Come on. (Duke Red) Tima, we've been looking for you. Bring them to me. I see. So it's you again, is it? You had better explain yourself before I have you thrown in jail. You're asking the wrong man. Back off! Why don't you ask your son what he's doing in his spare time? What are you saying? I may not know what's going on around here or what you two have been cooking up, but one thing is obvious: that Dr Laughton was involved. And his murder was probably instigated by both of you to make sure she be kept secret. - Take them both in at once. - (Guards) Yes, sir! Come on, move! (Chuckling) Beautiful, isn't it? I made this for you, my dear. One day you will rule the entire world from this glorious throne. Me? Why? Because this is your true destiny, Tima. Let me show you. - Kenichi! - Kenichi? (Grunting) Kenichi! Oh, Kenichi, are you all right? You've got to wake up. Come on, now. Please, Kenichi. Kenichi! Kenichi? You coward! What have you done to my nephew? Relax, old man. You'll hurt yourself. He'll be OK. We just had to shut him up for a while, that's all. Kenichi? Kenichi? I'm going to file a formal protest with my embassy. This is a direct violation of international law. Oh, I see. File a protest with your embassy. I didn't realise you were such an important political figure. You can do as you please, of course, but it won't do any good, because soon every nation will bow down to Tima. She's come a long way. I think she'll be of use now. You have to make Kenichi the way he was before. Why do you waste all your energy on someone so insignificant? Look, the power of the universe is at your full disposal. What power do I have? I don't understand. You have to tell me if I'm a human or not. - (Clears his throat) - Please tell me. Am I really just another machine like those poor robots? Oh, Tima, what a silly thing for you to say. I promise that you are nothing like those pathetic robots. Then, I am human, same as Kenichi. There's no difference. What are you talking about? You are no mere human. Humans are inferior creatures, confused by love and morality, ruled by emotions. You are superhuman. Then it is true. I'm not a human at all. Excuse me, sir, but I've brought the clothing for Miss Tima. Yes, Tima, that's correct. You're a robot. But you are the greatest, most sublime creation in the entire world. How can that be? I possess love and emotion. You said that's human. You only think you do, my dear, because we haven't completed you yet. You're not finished. The fluctuations of your supreme powers are taking the shape of such things as emotions and love. Very soon you will... You will then merge with that superhuman throne and become a computer weapon that will conquer the world. And when that happens, all your emotions and memories will be completely erased! And where exactly did you get that kind of information? I'll have you know, I consider myself a detective. It's time, Miss Tima. It's time to change. (Rock's voice) Father, stop deluding yourself. - (Gasps) - Rock! - (Gasping) - It's you! (Duke Red) What is the meaning of this? As our leader, you are the only one who should sit on the throne, Father. You cannot give the power of the universe to this thing you've created. No! (Two gunshots) (Groans) Tima! Tima! Huh? I'm an artificial human, a machine created to conquer the world and destroy it. You were created to save the world, not to destroy it. (Kenichi) Stop it! Kenichi. (Groans) - Who threw the switch? - It started by itself. Switch to manual override and cut power! Controls not responding! It got out of the system. It's running on its own. Doctor Clunky! What happened here? Why did the alarm go off? The omotenium production system has gone completely out of control. - What is going on here, Doctor? - I have no idea. Stop this, Tima! You'll destroy the Ziggurat! This is punishment for toying with robots. The computer network and Tima's emotions have been integrated. She's beginning to lose her mind. "And so God's wrath descended upon the Tower of Babel." Oh! No! No, Kenichi, she's not Tima anymore. There's nothing you can do for her. I understand. We've no choice but to bring down the omotenium production levels or this entire site will be destroyed. We must hurry. The probability of mankind's survival will be 30% in one hour. Control of the Ziggurat is now being transferred to my operating system. All supplemental earth weaponry will be activated from my network in 30 minutes. Attack targets are the world's major cities and 7,586 additional facilities. Destruction of the human race will begin through irradiation and the use of multiple weapon systems. This will be complete in 17 hours, 27 minutes. Did you hear that, Duke Red? The superhuman that you created is saying it doesn't need us anymore! Tima! Don't go! No! (Screaming) Ohh, aargh, ohh, ohh! Just hang on, Kenichi! Kenichi! Kenichi! Tima. Tima. Tima! (Worker) 'Doctor, this is an emergency. We've lost control of...' How can it be? (Screaming) Get out of here. Robots aren't allowed in this sector. You are forgetting your place! Tima, it's me! Look at me, Tima. I... I'm Kenichi. (Screaming) Ohh... (Gasps) (Screaming) Stop it!
