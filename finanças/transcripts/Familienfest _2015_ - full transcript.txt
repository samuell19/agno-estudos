Why is he not responding? He had promised to tell us when he would arrive. Are you still talking about Max? Max, Max, Max... - Hannes ! If that's how it is, do n't bother it. Yes, it's not worth it. Slim ! Renate will land. Go ahead ! - Me ? - Well yes, who else? It comes from Paris expressly for you! And make sure she doesn't drink too much! FAMILY PARTY Dear listeners. Tomorrow, he will celebrate his 70th birthday. It was Hannes Westhoff, who interpreted the Impromptu Op.90 No.2 in E flat Major of Schubert. In his honor, we will broadcast various extracts ... ... a sonata performed by Hannes Wetshoff. I do not believe... How do you want me to do? The cigarette lighter is nase. - Have you already told him about it? - No. I'm waiting for the right time. A question of timing. And if he says no, what do you do? I have other alternatives: Anne, Renate, Frederick. Frederik is a professor He hasn't 50,000 euros! Tell me, why am I hanging around at the airport? I'm here ! I'm here, damn it! Here ! - Gas station ? Yes, but the intention is there! Did you have a good flight? - Nothing special ! Anne will surely ask you if you are coming for Christmas. - Oh so cute ! - So what ? You coming ? - Hannes, I'm already here on your birthday, that's enough for me! Can we stop somewhere before the roast? Sir? You hear me ? Sir? - Yes. Can you tell me what day it is? Yes, March 28, exactly. Tomorrow is my father's birthday . You hesitate, huh? But no ... Why are you saying that? Family is always complicated. Look ... you're my guy. Her family is undergoing it, but you, I chose you. Still happy ! One. And it makes you laugh! Anne will probably ask you if we're coming for Christmas. - We are barely in March! - I know. It is a mania at home. One. Mr. Westhoff? Doctor Linse, hello. Jenny, take the blood pressure. - Yes. Mr. Westhoff, good morning. May I? What are you doing this weekend ? Your pulse is very weak. Give it to the doctor, he'll understand. Alexandre ? Another half liter, please. If you want to give me a present, avoid drinking too much. Hannes... Thank you. No thanks. And Max? Do you have any news? He's coming ? I am not a prophet. Your USB stick, Mr. Westhoff. I spoke to Doctor Renz, from Munich. You should be in the hospital, you know that. And you shouldn't drive. I don't know where my car is. Still have questions ? Good luck. - Yes ? - I am leaving. Goodbye, and good recovery. I'm going to see my family, to celebrate my father's 70th birthday. It's nice. Yes ... No, I ... I don't really want to go there. - And? - Could you accompany me? To your family celebration? There will be an excellent meal, good wine ... You will have nothing to do. Well ... not with me. Looks like you are my girlfriend. I'm sorry, I can't. Please ! I cannot. No ? Okay. - I would have gone. - Anke! Wait! Monsieur ? Your palm! Ah yes, shit! My present ! Okay, great , handsome, young man. I finish at four o'clock. - Hello ! - I am happy to see you ! Gregor! - Hello. - How happy I am! - Ouch! - What did you do to yourself? - Nothing, I got stuck. - Gregor! - Papa ! - Anne! - Are you hurt? - Excuse me ! - Why are you crushing me? An unconscious desire for murder. Come, get up. I'm sorry, I didn't see you. How is it going ? - Say, you drank! Two glasses of wine ... - Where have you been all this time? - The plane was late. - I called the airport ... - She did! - Why did you call over there? - I was worried ! - You were to come to Paris, right? - I'm overwhelmed right now. Best wishes ! - Service station, huh? Are there flowers elsewhere? Take care of them, Anne. I'm going to park the car. Anne? Do you have gift wrap? We've been together for two years ... - And we want children? - Maybe later. - Were they told you're a student? - What? Let's say ... in molecular biology, fourth year. I'm OK with that. Sounds better than a nurse. Yes it's fine. Thank you. It's here ? That's crazy ! It's Gregor. Mistrust ! - Pretty cactus! - Hello ! On the edge of the lake ? Come on, let's set up our things first. - Hello. - Hello. You must be Mr. Westhoff, the great pianist. So he wanted a very strange destiny. Jenny Muhlenkamp, Max's female friend. Ah yes ... Well, delighted anyway. Me too. Max has told me a lot about you. Nice to meet you. Journalist too? No, molecular biologist. Sounds good but ... what is it? I study cellular exchanges ... - I have some ideas on this. - Ah, you're joking? I didn’t know. - Where's Max? - Here ! So there you are. Yes, here I am. Anne was afraid you weren't coming. She was wrong. Yes. I see it. Well... See you later. - You come ? He's the butler. Hello. Who are you ? Vincent Broder. Hello, Mr. Westhoff. Nice to meet you. I am Frederik's companion. - Ah yes. He did not tell me that he would come accompanied. He phoned your wife. But if it bothers you ... You're welcome. You can't help it if my wife hasn't told me. What would you have said? Nothing that could make the front page of a fag magazine. Well there it is ... there it is, Max. It's good, they are all there. Where is he ? He didn't take a single step towards me. He stared at me from the top of the stairs. And you, did you go to him? I'm the oldest, right? Hannes ... Please! - Hi, Freddy. - Hello ! Come here, you! What's wrong ? What do you mean ? You look exhausted. Friendly welcome. Sorry but ... it's true. - I had an accident. - What? I found myself in the middle of a field ... I was super scared. Have you seen a doctor? Yes of course. Everything is fine. Shit ! You say everything is fine and no one here is looking any further! Drop it. Max, I ... No, I don't find it funny. Hello ! So ? - Hi brother! How are you ? - What's wrong, Max? - Why ? A real corpse. He had an accident. With her bitch, no doubt. She is a molecular biologist. - In a whore bar, yes. - Wow! - Hello! - Hello! So ? You are happy ? Yes ! Very! I'm happy for you. And we want ... we want ... share a little of what we have with someone. We don't want ... it to stop, after us. We want ... we want a child. More... it's amazing. Max? It's me. ... no, neither tomorrow. You sleep ? I just wanted to say hello. Health. Everything is fine ? It's okay, I stop. Did you come with someone? What's her name ? Jennifer. We will see you later. Stop! Not too much ! And now vodka. Your best Salty Dog. Not bad. So ? You thought about it ? Yes. Drop it. Your father will send you on the roses. With everything you've already borrowed from him ... - What do you know about that ? - Listen... Anne, she's stuck. He removes the household money, not a penny more. Max is not one to donate. I would give them to you, but I have nothing left. Only Frederik and his friend remain . - Frederik and Vincent. - Yes, Vincent. I'm going to ask dad first. - Good luck. See you soon. Cute, your girl. It is serious ? Well ... that we don't know until afterwards, right? - Where did you get it? - To emergencies. So ? How's life ? Hi there. And you ? It would be better if someone lent me 50,000 euros. I know. Is that why you were talking to Renate? No, she taught me how to make a Salty Dog. What? It sucks to have to hit money at his parents at your age. - Still giving lessons? - At table ! Yes ? - Dinner is ready. - I'm coming very soon. We'll do it later. What is it ? We have something to tell you before your birthday. Yes what ? We're going to adopt a child. And you will be ... his grandfather. A child ? Next week, we'll know if it's a girl or a boy. Can we speak of "grandfather" when it is a child ordered from catalog? A table ! Thanks, Charly. There isn't one to help me here. You poorly educated them, your men. Hope it is not the last! Do you use vegetables? The sauce is there. He's a Montepulciano. Heiner sent me a case. You want some ? My dear Hannes ... Finally, here we are! Today, on the eve of your 70th birthday, you are surrounded by your loved ones: your children and their partners, and your ex-wife, Renate. We know you are not fond of big feelings and we respect it. But what brings us together this evening is love. And even if the big day is only tomorrow, I wish you today to feel this love. I want you to know that if we're here tonight, it's only ... because we love you. To you, to love and peace! - To love ! You are all pale. - Remind me of your name? - Vincent. Vincent, could you ... swap your place with Frederik? - Of course. - Thanks, that's nice. Dad ? Why ? Habitually, there are only women on this side of the table. That’s all you. Always so rude than 30 years ago. - We can joke, right? But yes, he is right. Come on, it doesn't matter. Our father is like that. - Are you serving me? - It's very good, Anne. Thanks, Charly. If I didn't know ... that you don't think about what you say, we would leave this table immediately. Except that in this case, you would deprive yourself of an excellent roast ... and your heritage. Except for the reserved portion imposed by the law. - We don't say such things. Pardon ? Do you know that under the Third Reich, we were sending homosexuals to camps? We don't mess with that. Especially when you're older. - Look, Angie ... - Jenny. Whatever. Anyway ... - Let her finish. The President of the Bundestag said that civic courage, is to intervene in the face of condemnable words. And after ? You are certainly full of good feelings, but that said, if you intend to explain to me, under my own roof, what is done and what is not done ... Yes ? I can recommend an excellent hotel. Are you serious ? Do I look like a comic? - Well, well ... - Nobody's leaving! Besides, she's right. I loved the reference to the Holocaust, Jenny. There are limits to everything. Helmut Schmidt, the former chancellor ... Thanks, I know who Helmut Schmidt is. There is an actor who was called like that. A colossus with a large jaw ... Still, he said that we always something to learn from others. Hannes ? Do you want to apologize? I'm too old and too wealthy to listen to this bullshit. - An old Russian proverb says: "If only youth knew, what old age could". Talk for you. Me, I still manage very well. More... - Excuse me. - Gregor, no ... Frankly, I find it rich too that Frederik shows up with his faggot ... and suddenly, we no longer have the right to joke without them all going crazy. How ? What? How much do you need ? - A cold ? - Not really, no. What is he doing ? - He's eating. Didn't you manage to get him chased? She did not know and yet she put her finger on it. It is his family heritage. - It has nothing to do ! - And how it has to do! No ! Your father did not send anyone to the gas chamber. It is already enough that grandfather did it, and effectively! - That's what I'm saying. - I prefer to ignore it, just like I ignore the fact that you disappear regularly. And the rare times we see you , you attack us, especially your father. In any case, it would be nice if you made a move, Jenny. - Why would she do that? - I was not finished ... Because he left, two hours before his birthday! Do you find that normal ? - She won't do anything. Nothing happens. - You speak ! Hannes wants to screw up! - And you clear the table. None of you want to make a little effort. It's a very personal decision , right? To choose to live with a psychopath. - Is that how you see me? - I was speaking in general ... It was I who convinced him to invite you. You, the one who tells the worst horrors about me For more than 20 years. Can you imagine what it cost me? - I don't care! Should I thank you? - No. But it's also your family! And without me, they wouldn't be there. Poor darling, you're gonna make us all cry! Do you want me to tell you why he left you? You are heartless! - Not like you ! - Leave that. - No, I want to do it! Because I have to do everything here! All that to hear me say that I chose to be his slave. And none of you react! - Stop it, Anne. - Especially not you! - She's not entirely wrong. - Yes Yes... She, since she arrived, she drinks and no one says anything! It is finely observed! - Say, if we calm down a bit? - I am calm in person. She taunts me before your eyes! Thank you ! Thank you very much ! Thank you ! Anyone finished? I'm going to get some fresh air. Four hands? From there. Brahms did not write "lento" here. We resume there. At the first difficulty, we pass! Yes ? What's the matter ? Did you not like it? Can I ask you a question ? Of course, Jenny. When you separated, why did you leave without your children? He got custody. Maybe because I was already drinking a bottle of Bacardi before breakfast. For him, it was good. This is what allowed him to reject the criticisms I addressed to him, even the most justified, by attributing them to my irresponsibility. I'm sorry. I was the bad mother who abandons her children. And he, the poor victim who endured, until he could no longer, this completely ravaged woman. Yet a tiny part of myself has tried to play the role of "the woman at his side" ... It's a bit what I describe in my novels. But I did not succeed because of my character. Until then, I was not aware that with three children, it is always the mother who is put to sleep. Especially when the husband spends his time to crisscross the world in concert in concert, hitting hysterical cellists who worship him. And don't be pissed off with stories of diapers! In addition, he brutalized us, he was violent. But we don't talk about it, we're ashamed. You knew that Emil Cioran defined love like "the meeting of two saliva"? I don't know Emil Cioran. He's a Romanian. Poet and philosopher. A "private thinker". Check out Google, darling. We have barely arrived, and it's already like before. Must say that you have no sense of humor. And your Joan of Arc even less. The advantage with a broken finger, is that you can open your beer with it. Renate is tough with Anne. Anne is a born victim. Mom can't help it. I won't play for him, no way. - He asked for it, though. - Whatever ! It was Anne who figured it would make her happy. I'm not sure I can do it. It's been a while since I last played. Don't get tired. As your brother said, it’s Anne who imagines that it would make me happy. So much the better. Your stepmother, in her unfathomable wisdom, decided to celebrate my birthday in style Reich party congresses. We already know who the Fuhrer will be. I'm going to let go of this provocation like a ship on the horizon. Still, I solemnly promised him to be courteous. So if I could offend anyone , I would like to apologize. I imagine it comes from the heart. You will always ruin everything, even at 100! Since when have you been so vehement? Is it alcohol? Maybe since you asked Vincent to change places. That's it, Vincent ... Like the painter. But he's just a college professor. And a teacher is less than nothing. No, the teachers are the ultimate. I'm happy with him, if you want to know. But yes, I would like to know. So ? What are you doing when you are together? Do you chew on his ears? He likes that ? Why do you despise people so much? Healthy appreciation of the human species. Anything else, father? No, I just came to enjoy the work of my life. An abortion, a fag and a rogue. And not a single grandchild! But it can be arranged. Say, will you feel like an "uncle" when Frederik has a child ordered from catalog? - It's good, enough. - Me too, that's enough for me. One always wants money, the other absolution ... And you, Max, you don't even know what you want. Why does this old idiot still think I want money? - Come on, go to bed. - Anne ... One. But leave me! - Renate, that's enough! - What do you know about that ? Because you're also a walking breathalyzer? Oh darn ! Sorry. Do you know what your problem is? Saint Bernard syndrome. I do not think so So I am. Or rather... Or ... I'm not ... Oh, I don't know. So I don't think ... I'm not. You could help me ! It wasn't me who wanted her to come. - He is right. - Come. Leave me ! I can manage on my own. I don't need a protozoan! Anne... and protozoaire! Sleep well. Good night. Jenny ! Oh well, then! Can I help you ? What? No thanks. How nice. It's great, everything you do. - Excuse me. - It's okay. You don't want me to help you? It will be fine. Do you know where Max is? - Max? - Yes. No. Why ? I will see. Happy Birthday. Old idiot. - Everything is fine ? - Just a tension problem. That's when you get older. - We don't have that much tension anymore. - Not really, no. Do you remember when we put you in Frederik's stroller and you ended up in the lake? - Yes, it was great. For the old man. So ? I already thought about it, yes. If you could start all over from the beginning, what would you change? Well... I would have been better off not selling my first company. What do you mean ? Tomorrow he will be 70 years old, and I don't think it will ever change. - So what ? - Well, that sucks, right? So, you three? It's only for boys here. Tired boys. - I can come ? - No, it's just for him. Say, do you think ... that he has a problem? But no ! He is saving his energy for something else. Not like us. Max ? Oh shit ! Shit ! Max? It will be fine... Everything is out. Everything is fine. Wait, I'll help you. Here. It's good, everything is fine. Yes that's it. Tell me what's going on with you. You vomited blood! - It was red wine. You didn't drink it! Twelve doctors, seven clinics, four chemotherapies. I see. Everything is on my USB key. And your family doesn't know anything, right ? When we are out of time, what do we do? We find ourselves a pretty girl and we take her to a party. And we have a blast. There are morphine patches in my bag. Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday, Happy birthday, Hannes! Long live Hannes! All my wishes, all my wishes ... - Yes, it's good ... - Best wishes! It's nice of you. - What's the matter ? - You have to make a wish. Without saying it, otherwise it will not come true. Do you have any other recommendations for me? That you stay healthy, you eat better and you do sports. - Wait, I'm taking notes. And relax a little. Here, look ! Your boys are waiting for you. They have gifts for you. - Missing more than that ! - Show time ! - We can go ? Yes. And as we often say: there is no point in moving the past ... Here's the hero of the day! Happy birthday dad. We both know that we do not always agree ... Lately, I read a book on family relationships, and one sentence touched me a lot. She says that... that you have to accept imperfection. For my birthday, you tell me that I am imperfect? Oh no ! It is a little too early for that! I found the idea interesting. Don't classify things according to what you like and what you don't like. Anyway, you're my father and ... I love you. Happy Birthday ! Yes. Thank you. - From me too. - Thank you. It's from the two of us. - Claude Debussy... - An original printed at 400 copies only. For your collection. With the signature of Escarlot, the publisher. It must have cost you dearly. - Do you like it? - Yes, it's ... very surprising. Thank you. What do you have for your old father? It’s going to be hard to compete with that, and in addition, it’s badly packed, but I got my head out. I thought it would do you good to go on trips, as before. You took your car and you were leaving. And 70 years old today is like 50 years ago! - Is it still published? - For us, it's the equivalent of Mao's Little Red Book for the Chinese. - It's awesome ! - And look : there are relief maps and economic data. - It is well done. - Look for example: the country richest in oil is ... Venezuela. - Not Saudi Arabia? Not Venezuela. - Here ! - No, not here. Space is needed for the concert. - What concert? Anne! Can you come please? It was surely the wild boars. Or the gardener ... Whatever ! You know very well who it was! Why does he do that ? - But maybe ... What does it mean ? He wants to maim me? Neuter me? Frederik, please! It is his birthday. What's the matter ? Kai can't help me either. He says he has already invested everything he has. Do you want me to talk to Buning? He can wait a few days, right? I reviewed all my contacts ... I'm fucked up! Say ... you already have one there. What's wrong ? I didn't borrow the money from Buning. I borrowed it from people of a different kind. You really think I broke my finger by wedging it? Excuse me, I ... - Don't touch me! How can you do business with people who break their fingers? Always doing shenanigans, to dabble in shady business. - Listen... Your societies in the East, your wind turbines, your rubber plantations ... - I'm going to get out ... - Let me go, my god! Do you ever wonder how I live this? That everything can fall apart overnight? You do not understand ? I want a family, children ... I know, I understand! What do you want me to do ? If this algorithm works, we will be able to anticipate the stock market prices! No, but I dream! Another one who comes to congratulate me. For now, I have a score and a world atlas. And you, you offer me nothing? It’s also good. It will save me from having to feign joy. I will make a speech. I didn't know you wanted grandchildren. As we know , wishes are rarely realized . Look at Santa Claus ... Unless your Jenny is in the meiosis stage? No. No, I don't think I have time. It's been three years since I ... - We always find excuses. My God ! I have to go down. You are not in a state. But I came for that. What are you up to? - I'm going to give a speech. - Can I read it? Are you going to read this? Thank you very much, it's very nice, thank you. It's nice to have come. Best wishes ! It will be used in case of shortage! - Here you are ! - I was not going to refuse the invitation of my favorite pianist. - Say, it smells burnt, right? - Thank you very much. - I will see. - What is it ? - Stop it, Frederik, that's enough. - No, that's not enough. This is what was missing: Debussy. - No, not the Debussy! - With the signature of Escarlot. It's awesome ! A bonfire with its partitions! You are a hero! That will catch nicely! Frederik! Have you gone mad? - Surely an accident! - These are my scores! - His scores! - The wild boars or the gardener ... Hannes, keep calm. Hannes, not now! Are you burning my scores? Come on! Come here ! Leave it, it's okay. Everything is fine. - You're crazy! Yesterday you almost crushed me and today you hit me? This dirty little shit has burned all my scores! A fortune ! My birthday ! - You always ruin everything! - Enough ! Completed ! - Yes, you always ruined everything. It's just paper, your scores! Come on, get rid of that. They all went crazy or what? No, tell me it's not true. Is Hannes with us, with us, with us ... For Hannes, we are always there, always there ... Is Hannes with us, with us, with us ... Ah, a speech. Dear Hannes, I prepared a speech for you. The boys asked me and I accepted. It's a little toast or let's say ... a little fable. I made Jenny read it, but she didn't understand anything. She asked me what I meant exactly. And... there is so much to say that i don't know where to start. We have always admired you. Because you always told us that you were a very great pianist. A great artist. And the difficulty that there is to live with such a genius, this fable describes it fairly well. A scorpion meets a frog by the river. "Dear frog, said the scorpion, would you take me to the other side, I can't swim. " "Why would I do that ?" said the frog. "Once in the water, you will sting me and I will die." "Why would I do that ?" said the scorpion. "If I bite you, I will die too, and I will have won nothing." The frog thinks for a moment, accepts, takes the scorpion on its back and begins crossing. In the middle of the river, the scorpion stings the frog. "Why did you do this? We're both going to die." "I am a scorpion, it is in my nature, I cannot do otherwise." Dear Hannes, best wishes for your birthday. I see. Do you think I'm gonna swallow this because there are guests? - No. - It's good, enough, Max. For you, your guests are all assholes. I could also have told the time you broke our mother's jaw . Because she was still drunk! Is it retaliation time? No, this is not a settling of scores. I say that because you matter to me. For things to change. Because if, despite your ignominy, I didn't love you, I would not have said anything. Max ! Hannes! But help him! - I'm a monster, right? - He drank too much ! I am a nurse. Call a doctor! Doctor ! Mr. Westhoff? Your son wants me to talk to you. As well as your wife, and his mother. Please follow me. Take your seat, please. Thank you for being brief, I have guests. Your son has a CUP syndrome. I already knew Kapp-Putsch with Ludendorff, under the Weimar Republic. CUP is an English acronym meaning "Cancer of unknown primary origin". An unknown primary cause site carcinoma . We don't know the origin of cancer, but there are many metastases. The first diagnosis was made two years ago, and we look in vain for the primary tumor. He has already undergone several chemotherapy treatments. He is in the terminal stage of his illness. And what can we do? I'm sorry, but there is no treatment possible. He has metastases in the lymph nodes, the liver and spinal cord. And the blood markers are all bad. - How much time does he have left? - One week maximum. Or even less. Well... You will understand that we will take a second opinion. I understand how you feel. What? Do you also have a dying son? This fool who tells me that he understands me! Your son wishes to die in his birthplace. Hannes... What is happening ? He has cancer. A CUP Syndrome. It's cancer We're going to the moon, and that shit machine doesn't work! The origin is not unknown. By internalizing everything, like all of us, he developed cancer. My son is going to die. So put it on and go whine at your friend's house. Can we treat him at home? Didn't you hear? There is nothing more to do. Jenny is a nurse, she will know. I'm going to talk to him. - About what ? Hannes ! Max wants to go back. This is madness ! He is almost in a coma. - He asked to go home. - What if it lasts weeks? Here it is in the hands of qualified doctors. You will be the first to leave towards your beautiful Paris! - While my son is dying? Do you really believe that? But what does it mean for us? He dies. Watch out for the hose. Can you hold that for me? Wait ... the shoes. Can you fire the guests? - Call me, if necessary. - I'll keep you informed. Frederik, Are Are we going to play something for Max? No, I ... I won't play. It is too late for that. Too late for everything. Max was right, in everything he said. This house is cursed. And nobody ever said anything. We were too small. Now that Max is going to die, you say you want us to play? No ... you never wanted to! You beat us until we were bloody when we played badly. Say something, you too! Stopped. You just wanted us to "work". Let us honor you. But you know what? It didn't work, it didn't work. It's good. You said the right thing. What's the point ? Come on, let's play. I was not very handsome. The style I had! It was great. You are beautiful. What a nice picture ! Frederik! Better to stop, I think. Good night. So ? So, cowboy? Who would have thought that this anniversary would be nice? What is stupid is that it is already finished. More... what's even more stupid is that we met so late. I also think so. Really. But the stupidest thing would have been not to have met at all. Max ? I completely forgot to thank you. You made a beautiful speech. And... this fable, it perfectly describes ... I know it doesn't excuse anything but ... It perfectly describes my father. I would like to show you something. I'm not trying to be forgiven but ... I just want you to know that ... I kept everything. All your articles. I was really proud. But I would never have recognized it. Your article on ... I particularly liked the castle project in Berlin. "Your son wrote that." Unbelievable ! Max ! I'm here to say goodbye. Would you come for Christmas? Gladly. It would be my pleasure. See you soon. This... is life insurance. It expires next year. I know you are doing well, but I said to myself ... that if you put it right, your ... your child will have a good starting nest egg in twenty years. This is what I said to myself. - It's very nice of you, but ... But we have to think about it. If you want. - I just wanted ... - Thank you. You're coming to Christmas, huh? - Yes. - We want everyone to be there. And if there is anything, call me. - Yes. - A concern for money, for example. Is that so ? It could happen ... But why does everyone believe that I ... I also wonder. I see... You talked to him, right? Yes. I don't find it very cool that you play the middleman. So don't you think it's cool that I get you out of this shit? But I will only call him in two or three days. Otherwise what will I look like? - Are you coming for Christmas? - Yes.
