Habiba Mom oh, Abdul Mom oh and Rukaya Mom oh, you have failed to report to the Garda National Immigration Bureau in respect of the transfer under Dublin III regulations issued to you on October 10th. But we've contacted the Minister- Since you've not done so we're here to execute this transfer. Put your clothes on, please. Tell him about my scholarship. There was a petition. There's nothing I can do. I've been accepted for the 1916 scholarship- I'd advise you to start packing. Rukaya. Rukaya! Lads, lads, lads. Take it easy. Hold on. Take it easy. Please. Please.

There is no need for you to be out here. That means you as well. Back inside, please. This in not a prison. We can stand here. Keep that up. See where it gets you. Aisha. Hang on for a sec. Thank you. How are you? I'm fine. You're quiet today. I'm just not sleeping well. Treat yourself. I can show you where I want you to put it. Quick. We're closing. What's that you have there? It's just food. I'm just asking her to heat it up for me. You have a complaint about the food? No, Sir. But this is halal. We serve halal meat. You do not. I asked you many times to see your certificate. You said no. You refused. So, you're saying I'm lying? Did I call you that? Never call him that. OK, this carry on stops now. There is nothing- I'm just asking her to use the microwave for three minutes! Please, now. I'm sorry. Why are you giving him that? That's mine. I paid for that with my own money. You take what we offer. I'm sorry. So you won't let me use it? I can't. Fine. Come down tonight and I'll let you in the kitchen. I put that meal in the fridge for you. Just a sec. Don't know why he can't get you's the right food. It costs more. Less profit for him. Have you heard from that family? I just do what I'm told. Could they have done it without you? How long were they here? Five years. Where they now? In a detention centre in the UK. I didn't know I'd be doing stuff like that. I normally just do offices and warehouses. They tell us not to talk to you's. I don't know if you's know that. So you's don't try and get us to break the rules or whatever. So why you talking to me? Thank you. I'm doing an evening course in September in town. Information Technology. If I pass that, then I can apply to the access courses in the colleges. They do interviews, so... you never know. I can talk myself up anyway. Do you live in the city? Yeah. I live with me Ma. Just for now. What do you think of your job? I like it. It is OK. What is it, hairdressing? Hair and Beauty. I'm an assistant. For now. You like all that? The treatments an' all. It is OK. People like to come and talk. I just like to listen to them. That's good. You're a good listener, I'd say. Shit. See you later. See you. You're always lying. Two weeks. He's the one, though. I think he's the one. Two weeks! Why you jealous, eh? Why you jealous? Please, let me shine. Let me shine. What do you mean, "always another one?" Just do her make-up, please. Don't start! No fighting in here! Just going to put a little red on there, like that. Yeah. I have tried as much as possible to cover those dark areas. No, you're beautiful, Auntie. Thank you. You don't need to cover, but you know. Yes, you're getting there! You want to add a little more? Everybody's case is different. Whatever you say at times, can get you out of that place into another place. The following morning you are already onto another centre. Hm-mm. Maybe they don't like you or maybe you talk too much, maybe you ask questions too much, maybe you are flouting their rules, and all those things. After two weeks, one month, you will find there is no chain in my hand, but I am a prisoner, you know. I am not allowed to travel. Mm-hmm. Of course, I don't know anyone for myself but you're not allowed to travel or overnight to sleep outside. When I came, we were not allowed to have microwave, fridge, cookers, and all that, you know. And so... I... how... If I buy lollipop for my child, where am I going to put it? If he wants ice lolly, where am I going to put it? You know such things, I would love to buy it but I can't. The only time they will give it to you in the hotel is when they buy it on that particular day, you know. How do I explain that to my child? I want to provide for my child. I want to work. I'm not allowed to work. I want to study. I'm not allowed to study. You know? Such things, it's just a lot. Deportation is the painful thing ever. You're thinking, "OK, I've been tortured back home. I came here for safety and then I was traumatised inside these little rooms... where I was living in a little prison. Now that I have to be free, I'm told that I am being deported," you know? Mm-hmm. It's so, so painful and I've seen people going through that. OK. Don't change any of the answers that you give in the interview to what you've written here... ...because we could be refused on credibility grounds. When you do answer the questions in the interview you have to be prepared to go into detail. OK. OK, let's start with... what led you to seek protection? There was an attack on your home? Yes. Your father and brother were killed? Yes. Am I meant to say more? If you can. I've written it down. I know. A group of men came. They attacked our home. Aisha, try and keep eye contact. Who were these men? They was people that my father knew. How did he know them? He borrowed money from them. And you were there? How long did it last? I-I don't know. In the questionnaire you said they were there for an hour. I can't remember. I'm sorry, Aisha, but we can't be vague about this. We have to be clear because they will pick up on any discrepancy between what you said then and what you say now. Do you understand? Yes. So, how long were they there? One hour. Come on, I need to shower. Take your foot off the bus, please. Can you not see her running? Thanks. Did you go to college? I went to university in Benin. Doing what? Geography and Regional Planning. Sounds good, it does. Did you finish it? No. When's your interview? April third. This bus is no longer in service. Please board the bus ahead of us. Board the bus in front. Thank you. You're lovely looking. Where are you from? Nigeria. Why'd you leave? Like, is there something that made you decide? No, I just had to move. Are you an asylum seeker? From a war? No. It's good that they let you's work now, isn't it? After nine months. But... not everybody get a chance to work. You're lucky then, aren't you? So, if you want to say, "How are you today?" You say, "How you dey today?" How you dey today? How you dey today? S-Say it to her. How you dey today? Mm-hmm. See, she knows. She's just pretending she doesn't know. Or you can say, um... "I'm fine" is, "I dey fine. I dey OK". I dey OK. I dey OK. "I don't know" is "I no know." I know no? I no know. I know no? I no know. I know no? What? What's- I know no. What's happening? I've no idea. "What's happening" is "Wetin dey happen?" We'in dey happen, Aisha? Wetin- Wetin dey happen? We'in dey happen. No. Wetin dey happen? You have to say the 't'. Wetin dey happen? Wetin dey happen? Mm-mm. And when you're vexed with somebody you can say "Get out of here" "Comot! Comot here. Make you dey go" Comot. Comot here. Comot. Tell it. S-Say it. I don't like hot food. So why did you finish it? I dunno. I'll help you. What's that? My mate. What happened to him? He took his life. Fifteen, he was. Why? A bloke who played football with us took Barry into his garage and threatened him. He abused a few kids. He told you? We told each other. I'm so sorry. It's grand. I talked about it in treatment, so... Manning was asking about that CCTV camera. We probably should go. OK. See you tomorrow. Yeah. Can I talk to you? Yeah. Come round. Take your time. It's Manning. It's grand. Sorry. Aisha, it's OK. I'm sorry. Aisha. I'm fine. Ah! My sister, you don nearly finish? I'm heading home. Are you alright? I'm fine. Did Manning see me? I said you weren't feeling well. Look-It's fine. I don't need to talk about it. Yeah, but... you can tell me whatever you want, yeah? I'm not in tomorrow. OK. There's a letter here for you. No, it's grand. It's been here since yesterday. Let me call you back. What is this? I have to go. OK, bye. What is this? You can't move me. Yes I can. I have rights. Of course you do. It's illegal for you to move me without a chance to appeal. No, that's wrong. Ah? European Law says different. You're an expert now, are you? Why are you doing this? I want to put a family in that room. Why? Because I'm trying to keep them together. Now, you're going to have to get your things together quickly. I've got a taxi booked to take you to the station at three. So, you're moving me today? Yes. Where are you taking me? You're going to a centre in... ...Glentill. It's down South. I have my job here. My-My finances to help my mum. My solicitor is here. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not moving. OK, that's fine. But you'll be sure to let the IPO know your new address because you'll need that for your application. And, obviously, all payments will stop as well. So, you want to be spiteful to me? You can move me to self-catering. Those centres are full. Can you check? I don't need to check. I check all the time. Please. I'm sorry. Now, if you don't mind, I've got work to do. Why don't you stay here for a while? I need a permanent address for my application. I'm really sorry. I feel really embarrassed. But I thank you for the opportunity. I really enjoy my job. I'm so sorry, Aisha. This is Conor. Please leave a message. Conor, I am being transferred today... to Glentill. I'm going to miss you. Take care. Aisha, your taxi is outside. I'll take those. Thanks. Take care of yourself. Aisha. I'll go down with you. Help you settle in. Thank you for everything. What do you mean? I don't think our friendship is a good idea. Why? I'm not what you need. I'm sorry. Hello. Can I have your name, please. Aisha Osagie. "Insubordinate." Sorry? "Insubordinate." That's what it says. That is not me. It has your name on it. Don't worry about it. Can I ask a question? Of course. I have a work permit. Yeah, I'm afraid a work permit is no use to you around here. We're out in the middle of the country. You need a car to get a job. This is the one here, Aisha. So, if you can just hang on here, I'll take your case. OK, thank you. Thank you. Hello. This is Aisha, she's taking that bed. She doesn't say much. OK. You're very welcome, Aisha. If you need anything, just call, OK? OK. Thank you. Good luck, now. Hi, my name is Aishatu. But you can call me Aisha. Ji-Woo. How you, love? Are you from up the road, you are? Do you speak English? Lift your head, let me take a look at you. How're ya? Do you understand what we're saying? Do you want to earn some money? Show her the fifty, will you. Hello? Say something! Nah, come on. Let's go. Hello. Hey. I'm here for an appointment. My name is Paula Nolan and I will ask you some questions today regarding your international protection claim. The interview does not cover permission to remain. However I will note down anything I think may be relevant to the Minister's decision with regard to permission to remain. Aisha Osagie? Yes. This is Bes Emenaha who will interpret for us today if needed. Nice to met you. The interpreter will treat anything you say today as confidential. The interpreter will assist with communications, but has no part in the decision. Please speak in short segments to allow the interpreter do their job. Let me know at any point if you have any difficulties understanding each other. I will start the interview now by asking you to confirm your name and date of birth. My name is Aishatu Osagie.

OK, when you arrived you gave us two time-frames for when your father and your brother died. First you said "months" ago, then you said "weeks." Which one was it? It was two months. So, you're saying that your life would be in danger if you were to return to Nigeria? Yes. What are your internal relocation options? Wetin be that? They asking within Nigeria, anywhere dey where you visiting? Ah, nowhere. I have no place to go. The people are still looking for us. Why are they looking for you? My father owes them money. He borrowed to help pay for my Uni fees. They came and said that I should go and work for them on the road. Sell myself on the street. I can't do that. Do you want to take a break, Aisha? No. Did you report the death of your father and brother to the police? No. You didn't report their murders? No. After what happened... ...we were afraid. Were you or your mother hurt in the attack on your home? Yes. How were you hurt? Any broken bones or bruising? Yes, I had bruising on my arm. I'm going to ask you a difficult question, Aisha, if that's OK? Yes. Did the attack involve sexual abuse? Do you want to talk about it? Is there a medical report? No. Might there be evidence elsewhere that would help us? No. You remembered. Yeah. How'd it go? It went well, I think. They just asked so much questions. Did they? Yeah, about my family and my past. Yeah? About my husband. You're married, yeah? Are you's still together? No. Did your transfer go well? Yeah. I'm starting in a business park in next week. Conor! Is that him?

We will facilitate your travel back to Nigeria and we will pay for it but it would mean that your appeal will be withdrawn. Is that what you're asking?

Which means I have no bed for you. You'll have to pack up your things. I'll see if I can find you somewhere else. I'm sorry. Thank you. You're welcome. Take care, Aisha. Have a nice day. Breakfast is nine to ten downstairs. And then dinner is half past five to half past six. Do you understand? Yes. This floor is for asylum seekers only. There's a kitchen where you can cook yourself something, if you want to. Now, you're not to use the front entrance at the weekends, nor are you to go into the restaurant or the bar. Hello, there. You'll be notified if a single room becomes available. And if there's anything at all you want, just let me or another member of staff know at breakfast in the morning. Yes. Thank you. Hi. Good luck. See you later. Hello? Hello. Aisha? Peter Flood here. Yes? How are you? Look, just a reminder, Aisha, about your hearing on Thursday. Now, that's two days away. Are you ready? Hello, Aisha? Yes. Yes, I'm ready. OK. You'll get to say a few words this time. Just remember, what they're looking for is proof of "well founded fear," so we need to put across the danger that you're in. It would be great if you happen to have more detail on the attack on your home. Um, I know this will be difficult, but when you address the hearing if you could try and... put them in the room, if you know what I mean. Aisha? Yes, I will put them in the room. OK... and my condolences over the death of your mother. Thank you. OK, see you on Thursday at IPAT. Do you know where it is? Yes, I have the address. I will see you there. OK. Is there somebody we can contact for you? I don't think she speaks English. Let's go. Thank you. Hello, there. What happened to you? I fell. I had to go to the hospital. Are you alright? Yes. This is my friend. He was helping me. There's no visitors today. Can he just stay for a little while? He came all this way. He'd need to be cleared. I'm sorry, he'll have to leave now. W-We are sorry. Aisha. Do you want to say what happened? Do you want to talk about it? No. I'm sorry. Yeah, so am I. I have to talk tomorrow. I'm not ready. Do you want me to go with you? OK. Yes. Come in. I just want to lie down here with you. Is that OK? Yeah. Is this it? Yeah. Do you want me to go and ask him? No, just wait. Aisha. Hello. How are you? Good. Are you set? Yes. Right. This is Conor. Hello, how are you? Grand. Nice to meet you. Now, you can't come in. You know that? Yeah, fine. OK. So, we'll-Yeah, yeah. Alright, let's go. Great. With regard to the death of Aisha's mother, Morayo Osagie, we know from the authorities in Benin City that she was murdered just over three months ago. She was shot and killed in Lagos, 300 kilometres from Benin City. This terrible tragedy is an indication of the level of danger that Aisha's in. We would argue that there's a potential risk to her safety no matter where in the country she may be. While the death of Ms. Osagie's mother is, of course, tragic, the actual issue here relates to the future risk to the applicant. Now, it's clear from the country of origin information submitted that procedures are in place for her protection should this applicant report her situation to the authorities in Nigeria. We must remember that Refugee law is intended to meet the needs of only those who have no alternative. Primary recourse should always be to one's own state. Ms. Osagie... would you like to tell us a little bit more about your story? Yes, but it is not a story. It's not something I've just made up. I don't have another alternative. A group of men came to my house. They asked my father for the money that he owes them. He borrowed it so he can pay off my Uni fees and to help look after his family. He didn't have it so they shot my father and my brother. And then they had their way with me. They raped me. So, this is not a story. Thank you, Ms. Osagie. I'm really disappointed... that you'll make me wait for two years before giving me an answer to my case. I came here not begging for anything. Just for safety. I don't want a handout and I don't want anything for free. I'm just here for safety. What did you tell them? I told them what happened. All of it? May I have your attention please. Now boarding 18 south to Donegal. It-It's my bus. Thank you for coming. Why don't you stay longer? I have to be back by ten. OK. See ya. See you. Aisha... Can I kiss you? Yes. Bye. See ya. Hello. Hi. I just want to check if I have post. Can I get your name? Aisha Osagie. I'll check for you now. There. Thank you. I don't have much time. Do you have the letter with you? My Ma's in. She wants to meet you. We don't have to. No. No, it's fine. Some of the reasons given are not legally sound. We could challenge this in the High Court. It'll take time. There's a backlog. And after that, what are my chances? Hard to say. It can go either way.
