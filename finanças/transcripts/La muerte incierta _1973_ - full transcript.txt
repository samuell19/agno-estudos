You knew that this day would come. But sooner or later, I would have to make a long journey across the sea. Far away from here. I warned you long ago. But you must not despair, Shaheen, because I'll be back in a few weeks. And everything will continue as before. You say that you'll come back. But you're just saying it to make me calm. I know that this is the end. You're wrong. No, Clive. I've satisfied all your desires. You've taken advantage of me. You've forced me to do things that no woman would have accepted. But now you're tired of me. And you want to let go of me like a useless piece of junk. You made fun of me! Listen, Shaheen. It's useless. Why go on arguing? We have had very happy days in this house. Don't destroy it now. You have destroyed me. You've ruined my life. The day I brought you by my side... I made the biggest mistake of my life. I realize now, when it's too late. It's all my fault. All these walls are impregnated with us. You'll never get rid of my presence. I'll curse you, Clive Dawson! And I'll curse this place... and all the people who lives here!

Welcome home. Thank you, Sunda. - Welcome, mem-sahib. - What happened, Sunda? - Where are the servants? - We didn't expect you so soon. I would have brought flowers for mem-sahib. Don't worry about that and tell me why the service isn't in the house. The truth is that they left their posts. They were unfair and ungrateful people. I will explain to you later, it's something of no importance. Brenda... - This is my son Rupert. - Hi, Rupert. - Nice to meet you. - You look good. I'm fine, thanks. Your father told me a lot about you. - I hope he spoke well of me. - Of course he did. Neither good nor bad. I think it would be better that Brenda decrypts you by herself. Sunda, bring the luggage. Yes, sahib. It's nice to come back home. There is still some whiskey in the closet. Because Dr. Fanshaw hasn't been here often, I guess. He just came yesterday. Sybilla's the one who visited me more often. Well, darling. What about the house? I'm impressed. This doesn't help to lessen the impression. It's a bit dismal. But with you, these walls will acquire new life. This house is dismal? If grandfather could hear you from his grave, he would call you blasphemous. If Colonel Dawson could hear me he would agree. Specially what I said about Brenda. - Is it your father? - Yes. He founded the plantation. He was well respected by all. Highly respected. It's beautiful! That's wonderful, Clive! - It's like living in nature. - Yes, we are in the heart of the jungle. Some years ago climbing plants entered the room, but my father ordered that they be pulled out by the roots. Why? I don't know. He didn't like it. The Dawson are a family wrapped up with certain obsessions. Your words are out of place, Rupert. Forgive me. I didn't think that what I had said would disturb Brenda. Alright. We'll leave you so you can get settled. Rupert and I'll wait in the living room. Bye. I'll try not to take a long time. See you later. We'll be waiting. How did it happen? I don't know the details. Shaheen committed suicide... the very day she got your letter. They found her body in the river. I told you to explain the situation to her. That you explain it gently. And I made it so. What unpleasantries. She wouldn't listen to my reasonings. Brenda mustn't know anything about this issue. You got it? It's a story that would impress her. We'll hire new servants, and everything will be like before. The servants said that her spirit would return for revenge. So they left the house. You look nervous. Is there anything that worries you? No, nothing. I remember the day we parted. Shaheen cursed us all. After all, we're a cursed family. The last Dawson who died here was grandfather... -m Shut up! I have curiosity to know the region. Rupert has plenty of time off. He'll be an excellent guide. But Clive, I want to visit the plantation with you. Honey, I'll be too busy for a few weeks... and I can't go with you on excursions. I'm not asking for excursions, I just want to be with you. Well... In that case, you'll fulfill your wishes soon. You'll join me in visiting the north fields tomorrow. Clive, it will be formidable. I want to make you happy. At least for the first 3 months our marriage, before boredom invades us. When we reach this moment, I will know how to become a lover for my husband. And to truly, convert a husband into lover... is as delicate as converting a lover into a husband. Yes. Sundah! Pour me more wine. Don't you think that you've drunk enough wine? - Are you suggesting I'm drunk? That's not what I said. But you seem to be fatigued. And we should have some rest after such a long journey. Kalla, don't fall asleep. I'm very tired, Clive. I want go to sleep. What kind of obsessions did your father suffer from, Clive? Why are you asking that? I thought what Rupert said about Dawson. Don't pay too much attention to what Rupert says. He's a boy with a lot of fantasies. But it's odd that a man like your father... hated the harmless plants growing nearby. Clive... Why did the servants leave this house? Is it because I'm here? Don't talk such nonsense. Please, dear Brenda, stop imagining things or you'll be as absurd as Rupert. They left due to other causes. Possibly their discipline relaxed during my absence. This usually happens here. But tomorrow we'll find new staff. It's not that we don't have servants that bothers me. Clive, it's your state of mind that worries me. State of mind? Yes. Since we arrived here you seem to be another man. I suspect that something has happened, something I can't guess. but really important for both of us. Darling... I'm the same as always. And you're my wife. A Dawson. The owner of this house and all my lands. Oh, Clive. Come on, stop drinking. Remember what you promised me in London before we got married. No more whisky. I love you. I'll curse you, Clive Dawson! I'll curse this place and all the people who live here! But Clive! What's wrong with you? I don't know. I had... a horrible nightmare. Darling! I could expect anything of Clive, but not that he'd return from Europe married. I mean it. - He isn't an easy man to tame. - I like difficult men. Well, you've found the appropriate one. I don't know what we'll do without servants in this huge house. Don't worry about that. Only the two old servants are left. You'll have plenty of people asking for a job soon. I hope you're not wrong. Anyway, if I can help with anything... You're very kind! You can count on me for anything you need. - I'm always willing to help a Dawson. Good morning. Hi, darling. I see that Rupert introduced you to our neighbours. Tell me, Clive? How was the trip to Europe? Bad? You see, I came back married. I awaited your return anxiously, my friend. I don't like to drink alone. You had Sybilla to join you. It's not the same. Besides, she was too busy taking care of your son. She has spent more time here... than in our own house. You understood us well as always. Isn't it? I always said that Rupert needed a mother. Well, now that you're married again, everything is settled. From now on, my wife... will be on the jobless list. - Sunda... - Yes, sahib? You were present in the incineration of Shaheen? Yes, sahib! Did you see her burn? Yes, sahib. Corpses are found each day on the river bank. How do you know that it was her? I do believe so, sahib. We all did believe. I didn't see her face, but anyway... So you didn't see her face. No, sahib. I couldn't see it... because it was covered with the saree. Why did they cover her face? Shaheen died from drowning in the river. When her body was found, it was in a horrible state... and it was almost impossible to recognize. That's why they covered her face... hideously deformed. She was identified by the dress, her golden saree and... the blue necklace you gave her and always wore, remember? Where is the key to the basement? I don't know, sahib. I'll teach you. I'll be an expert soon with a teacher like Rupert. Are you hurt? Your hand! Don't worry. Surely it's a mosquito bite. - Did you put some ointment on? - Yes, but it's nothing important. Good night, Clive. Good night. Do I scare you? No. I don't expect to find you here. How did you get in? Through the door, just like you. What's the meaning of this bed and those chains? This basement looks like a prison, why? I don't know. We should go back in time to the days of my ancestors. Perhaps they used it as guest room. It's not a joking matter, Rupert. I'd like to know what explanation your father will give me. If I were you I wouldn't do that. He gets upset when someone snoops in the colonial past of the Dawsons. What did your mother think about this house? She hated it. As much as my grandfather and my father. That's why she left. She didn't die here? She died in England. She fled! - She fled? - Yes. Who did she flee from, Rupert? From the things that happened in this house. Of the Dawsons. But why? You'll find out. What I think I've figured out... is that you have a sick imagination. Give me the key to the basement. - It should remain closed. - All right. Burn these stains. They are similar like those of lepers. Clive, you're obsessed like all the Dawson's. It's just a mosquito bite. - Are you sure? - Absolutely! It seems very weird. Everything always seems weird for you. What is it, Clive? It's the first time that I've seen you here as patient. Our friend thinks he has leprosy. My God! Fortunately, it is not so serious. Maybe it's more serious than you think. I'm a victim of a macabre game. She's not dead. Don't look at me like that. I know very well what you're thinking. However, I have grounds to suspect that I'm right. Clive, this ointment will take away the swelling of the hand. But... I see your sickness is something else, old friend. Maybe. You should have a change of environment. Get out of that house for a few weeks and live outdoors. I think Paul is right. A safari to the jungles of the North would do you good. A second honeymoon with Brenda will change your ideas. I think you still have time to avoid some unpleasant things if you act wisely. I think you still have time to avoid some unpleasant things if you act wisely. Why didn't Rupert come? He didn't want to. Do you miss him? No, of course not. I thought he would have fun. Rupert doesn't like these things. He's too delicate. I wonder what really attracts Rupert. I assure you that large open spaces, do not. Rupert is a nice guy and very sensitive. Clive! I think you've never understood him. But you will. Yes, I think Rupert deserves to be understood by us. You're too hard with him. He's always secluded in his room, with his odd books and his paintings. - Have you been in his room? - Yes. Do you dislike it? Of course not. What do you think of his paintings? I just took a look. I don't know, but it seems to bother you that I was in his room. I said no! It was my father who killed it. You feel great admiration for your father, right? I realized that the days I have spent in the plantation. That I'm surprised that no one mentions him. What I feel for him isn't exactly admiration. How did he die? One day we found him dead in his bed. - Where was his room? - Upstairs, on the top floor. Thank you. You look tired, Clive. Are you worried about something? It's that damn animal. We haven't seen it the whole day. And it has unhinged my nerves with its roars. It seems that it's speaking to me. Can you understand the language of the tigers? Of some tigers, yes. Well, Clive. I'm tired, I'll get some rest. I'll stay awhile while I smoke this pipe. As you wish. - Don't stay too long. - No. I'll go right away. - Good night, mem-sahib. - Thank you, Sunda. Don't extinguish the campfires tonight. There is nothing to fear, everything is foreseen. I have set watchmen around the camp, sahib. - The tiger isn't far. - No, it isn't far. I will guard your tent while you sleep. No, it isn't necessary. Go and get some rest. So you will be fresh for tomorrow's hunting. I'd rather stay awake for surveillance. Why so much mistrust? Shaheen cursed you when she left the house, do you remember? Superstitions... You should not undertake this hunting, sahib. Are you scared of talismans, Sybilla? Honestly, no. No, I'm not superstitious. For me this necklace is like any other. I know its origin. But the fact that its owner is dead... doesn't impress me. I do gues so! How are your underground works? What underground works? Come on, Rupert! I've known you since you were a child. And I know well enough how you are. I can guess your intentions. Dear, Rupert... You haven't managed to fool me with your cautious arithmetic. My cautious arithmetic consists of leaving it to destiny. It's a very well-used old philosophy. You make your own destiny. Instead of being destiny's object. Anyway, we act similarly. Many philosophy... and very little love. And I like the fact that you're married. That's irrelevant to me. A married woman learns sometimes that certain social laws... aren't compatible with the laws of nature. Sahib, get up! Sahib! The tiger is very close. Anyway... You've been very lucky that the tiger didn't kill you. You need complete rest, Clive. Don't get nervous... and when you realize that it was only because of your imagination, you'll regain your normal rhythm of life. Hallucinations, my dear friend. Hallucinations. She haunts me. She haunts me in every moment of my life. No one can assure that the burned body... was Shaheen's. I'm sure that she is still alive. Hidden somewhere, waiting for the right moment to take revenge. Please, don't talk nonsense, Clive. She's prowling around this house. I can guess what you're thinking. You think I've gone mad. I'm not... like my father. You look at me with the certainty that another Dawson is showing signs of dementia. But this time... you're wrong. You're very wrong. Something strange is hovering over this house. Something intangible that will exterminate me. I know that the curse will be fulfilled. - No one can help me. - True, no one can help you. The story of that woman is your problem. Try to solve it. No matter how, but solve it. Do you hear the drums? Are the villagers! Are they dancing trying to scare the tiger. They're celebrating my funeral. They are a very superstitious people. You can't continue like this, without having servants in your house. Clive needs cares and you're alone. I'll stay here to help you. I think it's an excellent idea, I have to go away for a few days. Sybilla can be a big help. You're very kind. She knows this place better than you. Furthermore, at this point things are revolting in the region. What happened during the hunt with Sunda... is seen as a punishment from the spirits. The tiger is still injured, and when those beasts have tasted human blood... they tend to repeat the experience. You should be careful with Rupert. What do you mean by that? You know perfectly what I mean. Our situation regarding him is very similar, right? You can believe me when I tell you that I know Rupert better than anybody. And know perfectly what he's capable of. I know you know him well about one thing, but otherwise you are mistaken. Listen, my dear. Why are we playing this game? I'm not mistaken about Rupert. He's like all the Dawson's. A man obsessed with charm... that attracts us both. But obsessed anyway. What are you trying to say, Sybilla? I'm trying to warn you that you're in danger. You know that the Colonel killed himself in an attack of insanity? They say he locked himself in the basement and shot himself in the head. In the basement? Yes, in the basement. The truth is, that one day he disappeared. First, they said that he had gone to Europe and later that he passed away there. Until Rupert discovered one day... that his grandfather had committed suicide in this house. Clive never told you? Or told you why his first wife left him? I prefer not to talk to him about those nasty things. Don't... Don't turn out the light. Please, not tonight. The door! Did you lock the door? Yes Clive, I did. Brenda... My revolver. Brenda... give me my revolver. Please, calm down Clive. Calm down and try to rest. Tell me, do you like this painting, Brenda? A very beautiful woman. I knew that would attract your attention. I'm sorry, Rupert. I thought you weren't here. That is why you came in. Who is it? Shaheen. Tell me about her. I can't say much. I made the portrait when she lived on the plantation. Did she live here? Yes, long ago. Clive surely referred to this woman in his delusions. She must have been his lover. Yes, she was. And now she has become his ghost. His ghost? Yes, his ghost, Brenda. Because sometimes the dead come back. Give me more of that painkiller. That isn't advisable for you. Just a few drops. I can't stand this pain. Give me some, for God's sake! You must not abuse the dosage, Clive. Brenda... Can't you hear it, Brenda? I'm not Brenda. I'm Sybilla. Sybilla. Sybilla? Yes, it's me... Sybilla. Don't you recognize me, Clive? Brenda should be here. You don't need to worry about her. You need to rest. Try to get some sleep. Brenda... Rupert... Where are they? You know where they are! You know everything, but you hide it from me. They are fooling me. They're traitors, you're all traitors! Those drums! What does it mean what they're playing? Death. It's like the tolling of the bells of our churches. Clive! My God, what happened? Don't let him touch me! Take him away from me. I don't want to see him nearby. I don't want him to lock me up. You won't do with me what we did with him. No, no, I don't want to die chained like a beast. - I'm not insane! Take him away! You bastard! - Calm down, Clive. You are all against me, you're trying to make me think I'm insane. He continues talking nonsense. He wants to finish me off. He wants to lock me up in the basement. - No, Clive. - No... I won't allow it. I don't want to stay in the basement. - You won't do with me what we did with him. - Please... darling. It's useless for you to hide. I know you're here. You hate your father. The same as you hate everyone and everything around you. You didn't even love your mother. Now you're in love with Brenda. And everyone else is in the way. You're a poisonous snake, Rupert. You always made fun of the old colonel's madness. Getting rid of your father won't be very difficult for you. But I'm still here to prevent it. The plants, the plants! They are entering. They're coming to get me! Lock the door! BRENDA! Brenda! Brenda... Lock the windows! Calm down, Clive. Please, rest. The plants will bury the house. They will crush us. I know it very well. And Rupert, wants to lock me up in the basement... and chain me to that bed. No, Clive. Calm down and rest, for God's sake! What I say is true, Brenda, it's true! - You're wrong, Clive. Please, lie down. Rupert, where is Sybilla? - Sybilla is gone. - Where? She went back to her house. - She fears that there's a flood coming. - And she's gone with this storm? Sybilla is a very stubborn woman. Did you know that Dawson's always die with their eyes open? Stubbornly open. And no one has gotten close to them after their death. Stop talking, please. As you see, the Dawson's, even in the way of dying... have nothing in common with the rest of the people. When my grandfather was found dead, my father and Sunda... assured us he had an expression... of real terror in his eyes. Your grandfather didn't realize what he was doing. The grandfather... was locked up in the basement for months, chained to the bed you saw. When my father and Sunda went into the basement, they found the old colonel in the last throes of death, strangled in his own bindings. They say my father was assaulted with a sudden anguish... and he fell down on the corpse, asking for forgiveness, a thousand times. Forgive me! Forgive me! The really incredible part of this, is that the expression on the face of my grandfather... changed instantly. The features of his face became milder. Although his eyes were still open, the expression was different. The doctor certified that grandfather had been aware until the moment of death. But the truth is that we all believed that he stayed conscious even after death. No, Rupert... Clive...!
