A teen went missing in Reed's Point yesterday. The girl was camping in the area with her family when her mother reported hearing strange noises in the middle of the night. And by morning, the girl was gone from their tent. Authorities have arranged a search party for the missing teen. A group of hunters spotted what they believed was the Jersey Devil. A deadly accident on Reed's Point stirs up old history for the Reed and Franklin families. The body of a teen was found in the woods, discovered by a tour group researching the Jersey Devil legend. The teen has been identified as an ancestor to the original Franklin family. Animal attacks continue to haunt Reed's Point as the body of 20-year-old Cameron Connor was found unrecognizable in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Locals believe this is the work of the legendary Jersey Devil, while authorities are sure a bear or wolf is most likely what killed Cameron Connor. But strange tracks continue to multiply and spread terror among the locals of South Jersey. Another body was discovered in the pinelands of Reed's Point, the same location where a dead man's body was found last year. Surrounding the mutilated body were mysterious footprints of a hoofed animal. Investigators followed the tracks for nearly 4 miles. But the hoof tracks suddenly disappeared. New Jersey residents fear it could be yet another gruesome attack of the mysterious Reeds Devil. The Medical Examiner's Office will conduct an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death. Jersey residents fear it could be... A woman claiming to have photographed the mythical Reed's Devil said she caught the winged creature on camera while hiking on Monday night. ...while hiking on Monday night and described the figure as half human, half devil, standing taller than the average man, with matted fur. A group of tourists visiting Reed's Point claim to have seen the Jersey Devil. The legend of the infamous creature goes back centuries, and many have come to the area to capture a photograph or find out if it really exists. They believe it was silently tracking them before it mysteriously vanished. ...legend of the infamous creature, the tourists say it is indeed the Jersey Devil. I can't believe that was our last day of school ever! Finally, freedom! Are you forgetting about college? This weekend is going to be amazing! Right, it's gonna be fire! Hey, have a great weekend. Oh, you too, man. Ah, crap, we're so late! Your dad's gonna kill us. You'll be fine! Your dad will not be fine, Kelsey. Sweet ride! Can we move it? After I drop you kids off, I've gotta take a client all the way to Long Island in this thing. Told you he'd be mad! Hold on. What's wrong? I don't know. Maybe I should drive? What are you talking about? This was your idea. Besides, we can't take your car. It's OK. My dad's not mad. He's just in a hurry. He's just in a hurry. Come on, it's all right. Hey, guys, happy graduation! Thanks, Suzie! I see dad's in a good mood. He's just frustrated he has to entertain one of his high rollers tonight. He would rather be supervising you. Hi, I'm Suzie, your server. Hey, James! Let me know if you need anything. OK. Hey, buddy. This is awesome! Sorry, daddy. Sorry, sir. Sorry, Uncle Greg. We were just saying bye to our friends. We'll probably never see most of them again. I get it! I was young once. You were? Stop it. Look, I just can't be late picking up this client. James, we're all here. You got it, boss. Alex, glad to see you dressed for the occasion. Oh, I am. I came prepared. Dad, if you're the boss, why do you have to entertain clients? Don't you have someone who can do that for you? There are certain things you can't pay people to do for you, Kelsey. You'll find that out once you go to college. We still have each other. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Hey, what about me? Of course, you! Would anyone like anything to drink? I'll take a vod... soda. I'll take a soda. Thank you. You passing out on me? No, I'm not. I'm just resting my eyes. How do you expect me to get through college with that attitude? I intend to actually go to class, thank you very much. That's boring. Well, unfortunately, I have to get a degree if I want a future. So does Kelsey. Dad! Look, if you think you're going to live the rest of your life on my money, you're mistaken. You need to be more like your cousin Sarah. Don't worry, Uncle G, I'll make sure she goes to all her classes. Me too. What are you majoring in, Sarah? Journalism. Yeah? We need some honest journalists again. Good for you. I'm majoring in journalism, too. Gonna be a news anchor. You actually need to know what's going on in the world for that, Alex. You can't just sit there and look pretty. Oh, but he is pretty! They're being mean to me. Excuse me, I've gotta take this. Yeah, look, that land has been in my family for hundreds of years. I'm not going to tie it into this deal. No way. Can I get you anything to drink, James? God, I would love a coffee. It's gonna be a long day. Franklin has me working a double shift. Look out! Shit, hold on! Kelsey? Sarah? Sarah, you're alive! I pulled everyone else out, but I think they're all dead. We're not alone out here. There's something else out here. Hey, Sarah. How's the Jersey Devil article coming? That good, huh? It's mostly folklore nonsense. I can't believe there so little on Kelsey's disappearance and what's really in those woods. Are you sure this isn't too painful for you? That's exactly why I need to write this article. It's been a year, and no one wants to talk about it. The police gave up. I feel like I need to do something. I know you don't want to hear this, but as a reporter, you need to face the possibility that Kelsey is gone. She's alive. I can feel it. Something is in those woods, and it's gonna hurt someone else. I get it. I'm just worried, that's all. I don't think this is healthy, and I should have never agree. Hey, guys, look at this. Did you know that there's some kind of feud between your family and the Reeds? And they live within the Pine Barrens. Maybe they know what happened to Kelsey. Exactly. OK, Sarah, don't even start. What if they found out that Kelsey was a Franklin? I mean, who knows that these weirdos would have done. We should never have got on that dumb RV. OK, I'm pulling this article. Clearly this is too much for both of you. Maybe we reach out to local law enforcement with this information. No, a 50-year-old article about a family feud? The Jersey Devil? And how it's all linked to the possible disappearance of your cousin? They never did find her body, and I know what I saw. I know it sounds crazy, but bad blood never dies, Alex. OK, Sarah, you're talking crazy. You think that your crash and Kelsey's disappearance have something to do with some phony legend and some ancient, stupid family feud? It's not that crazy. Anyways, I just thought it'd be good research for the article. Did you not hear me? I'm pulling the story. Max, we can handle this! Fine, but under no circumstances do you guys go into those woods. But if I can... Sarah, promise me. I promise. OK, Alex, I think you have your own assignment to work on. All right, copy that. You still here? It's all on this Jersey Devil thing. What's going on? It just took her, that thing. I was there, remember? You had a concussion. But Sarah, we've talked about this. It could have been an animal. No way. You're stuck. How? Well, let's take a look at it. I mean, this story we're working on, it doesn't exactly have an ending now, does it? I know what I saw, and I know how crazy I sound. As journalists, there's a lot of things we just can't prove. Kelsey survived. I know she did. I don't know what that means. All I know is that sometimes, people can manifest a tragedy to help them cope. And I don't know. Maybe this is just your way of coping. Maybe. So what are we going to do about it? Finish the story. That's the last thing she ever texted me. Still haven't deleted it. I probably never will. I need to find out what happened to her. They ran search parties for months and, they never found her body. If dozens of people with dogs, cops couldn't find her body, what makes you think that you can't? I know what I saw. It might bring closure to the story. Fine. But this isn't just about the story, then. It never was. It's about finding out what happened to Kelsey. I'm going with you. I don't need a babysitter. I have to do this on my own. Well, call me. Keep me updated. You're still here. How's it going, Max. I was just finishing up. I just saw Sarah walk past. She doing OK? Yeah, yeah. Alex, what's up? Nothing. I'll see you tomorrow. Don't get yourselves killed. Are you there yet? Yeah I just got to Devil's Cafe out on Reed's Point. Don't tell Max, but I just spoke to the owner. She said she might know something. Well, that's a good start. Did she say anything about the Jersey Devil? Kind of laughed at me when I mentioned it. Are you following me? I didn't want you to come alone. I can't believe you drove all night. Alex! Sorry. Way to be a creeper! Don't go looking for the Devil! Because he knows, he knows. He's here. He's gonna find ya! I ain't afraid! No, I ain't afraid! You been warned! You been warned! You been warned! OK, so what's the plan? What, exactly, are you trying to find? I don't know. Maybe this is a stupid idea. Well, we're here, so... Let me get that for you. You the kids that called? Yeah, Sarah Franklin. Well, Beth's in the back. I'm not sure I can be of much help to you. I'm doing a report from my college paper. Mind if I ask you a few questions? I... don't bother me much. What I'm looking for is any information on that big RV crash from last year, from a local's perspective. Talking about that trailer that went up in flames? People got killed, girl gone missing? Yeah, that one. I don't know much about it. Sheriff did a search party. Nothing turned up. Any idea what happened to her? No idea. Animals got her. Look, between you and me, I don't even think she was in the vehicle. She totally was! Excuse me? Nothing. Well, I'm pretty busy, so sorry I can't be more helpful. You know anyone who can take us into those woods? You two kids aren't trying to track down the Jersey Devil, are you? Because we get so many people in here looking for that thing. Is it real? I've lived here my whole life. Only people ever seen it are tourists and crazies. This damn place is called The Devil's Cafe. But no, Jersey Devil ain't real. We're not saying it is. We just wanna head to the site. And why would you wanna go there? Because we were in the accident too, and we want to see for ourselves. I see. We really want some closure. Look, I might not know much, but sometimes it's better to just let those things lie. That's my advice to you. I think she's right. If you know anyone who might know those words, that would be helpful. My shift's ending. Sorry I can't help. That's your second refill. You're gonna have to pay for this. Late one was on the house. Well, maybe we should bail. Maybe this was a big waste. You kids want some more coffee? Just the check, thank you. Carla told me there were some kids asking about going to the woods. Is that you two? Yeah, why? You know someone? If anybody knows these woods, it's Hank. And he's probably done with his last tour. He can take you where you want to go. You want to go into those woods with a complete stranger? I'll be with you. I'm sure you can protect me. Is that sarcasm? Yes, it's sarcasm, Alex. I think that's him. Hi. Don't look! Why? I don't know. Just don't look. Who'd you call about? Kids are over there. You kids looking for somebody to take you into the woods? Maybe. Well, Beth called me. She said someone needed a guide to take them into the Pine Barrens. You know about that big RV crash last year? Yeah. You know where it happened? They've closed that road now, you know. That's where we want to go. Well, you're in luck. It's a short drive, and then a 30-minute hike to that side of the highway. Can you take us? It depends. How much you got? 200 is all I got. Sure. You pay for my BLT. I'm gonna take that to go. You can follow me. Fresh blood. He's gonna love you! Hey! Scram! Come on, andale! Let's go! Get back, let's go! That's Steve. He's a little touched. You two ready? Follow me. I still don't have a good feeling about this. He looks nice enough. You ready? Yeah. Let's go. Yes, sir. Hey, Max, just a heads up. I'm following Sarah out to the Devil's Cafe on Reed's Point. I've been driving all night. Please don't be mad. I mean, you know Sarah. She just wants answers, OK? So listen I'll send you a text later when we're on our way back. Bye. Come on, Alex! Hey, this is Alex Williams. Sorry... Hi, this is Sarah. Please leave a message. Devil's Cafe. Carla speaking. Hi. I'm trying to get a hold of my friends who said that they would be at your cafe. - I - really can't help you. I'm worried about them. I haven't been able to get a hold of them. One of them is a girl, and she has short hair. The other's tall and has long hair. Have you seen two college kids by that description? Oh, yeah, they left a little while ago. Said they wanted to see the closed road where that RV crash happened. Oh, OK. Which road is that, exactly? It's Pine Creek Road, right near Route 561. OK, thank you. Mm-hmm. You were in that RV that crashed, huh? We both were. You must have a lot of guilt being the only two survivors. Well, they didn't find my cousin, so... What do you mean? I mean she disappeared. Disappeared, how? I don't know. All I know is that something dragged her away. You didn't tell me that. You didn't ask. OK, we gotta go back. Come on! Why? Listen, because you two are chasing the Devil. We're just trying to find out what happened to my cousin. Are you talking about the Jersey Devil? Shh! Things go on in these woods that will put the fear of God in you. Bullshit. I'm just kidding. I do that to everybody I bring out here. It's fun. Come on! I mean, I want you to get your money's worth. That's why people come up here, is to get the crap scared out of them. Do you even know where the crash happened? Yeah, it's right up here. Come on. So what's the story about the Jersey Devil, anyway? Well, there's been lots of them. Most of 'em go back to the Reed family. The who? The Reeds. The story goes, they had 12 kids. When she got pregnant with a 13th, she cursed it, right? She didn't want to have another kid. When it was born, it had hooves like a deer, big claws for hands, forked tail. Father took it out in the woods to bury it. The creature killed him, and then went back and killed everybody else. Then, there's the feud. You OK? Yeah, never mind. Hey. Come on! We're right up here. All right, this is my rest spot. We're stopping? Take a rest. Maybe this wasn't a good idea. You're probably right. I thought he said that we were close. I don't understand why we're stopping. You know, when that RV blew up, that was a big deal. The entire town was out here looking for your friend. My cousin. Hey, what do you think happened to her? I don't know. It's tough to say. Well, maybe it was the Devil himself. Hence, the Jersey Devil. You believe in that? I don't not believe in it. You know, you spend enough time in these woods, and you see a lot of strange things. Here we go again. Can we just get to the site? All right, let's go. It's fresh blood. Did you do this? This is probably hunters. They hung their kill up to come back and get it later. No. No, this is not hunters here. I'm telling you, I got a bad feeling. We should go. Look, it's not a bad idea. We gotta go. Please, can we just go? Alex, slow down! Your bad leg! Help us! OK, hold on. Sarah, I'm stuck. Oh, Christ. Oh my god, I can't look. All right, well, then don't look, all right? Boy, you got yourself in a pickle here, kid. Just breathe. Kid, don't look at it, breathe. Let me see here if I can... ready? Yeah. One, two, three. Don't look! OK, just hold on. You got your leg stuck in this thing. I don't know how, but you're stuck. It's killing me, Sarah, it's killing me. We're trying. We have to get it off him. I can't. I need a saw. I have one in the truck. Crap. Hey, I'm a hunter, kiddo. I use the saw to trap wolves and for situations just like this. Both? Yes! I'm gonna go back to the truck. Shouldn't take me more than 30 minutes. I'll be back by dark. Wait, by dark? Yeah. You can't leave us here! Listen, it's either that, or we stay here all night and go back and get it in the morning, which I don't recommend. You should go. You're gonna wanna tie that off, slow the bleeding. Animals are gonna smell the blood. Great. All right. Hurry back. I'll be back as quick as I can. I did not see today ending like this. OK, I'm supposed to take this off, and tie it around my leg to stop the bleeding. OK. Right. I gotta tie this around my leg, OK? We've gotta tie it tight, OK? We've gotta stop the bleeding. Take this. You ready? It's gotta be tight. OK, one, two, three. How are you feeling? Like crap. I miss her. So do I. She'd be here today if it wasn't for me. You can't blame yourself. I didn't wanna drive my car. You didn't crash that RV. But I was the one pushing her. Hey, don't do that! Kelsey was lucky to have you as a cousin and as a best friend. We both are. She's alive. What the hell is that? No idea. He left over an hour ago. He should be back any minute. I don't think he's coming back. I don't think so either. I'm gonna go and look for help. Well, you think it's a good idea? It's either that or sitting here doing nothing. I know, but what... I mean, what if you get lost? If I keep that ridge line in sight, I should make it back to the car. I don't know. I'll Trace our path back. It's not like we have much choice, Alex. I know, but I don't want you going out alone. I don't see any other option, do you? You're hurt pretty bad. If I don't get help soon, your leg could get worse. I'll be as quick as I can. OK, I trust you. Be careful. I will. God, I hope I'm not next. Great, no service! What are you doing here? Alex! Sarah! Can I help you? Sorry, I don't get a lot of visitors here. Sorry to bother you, but my friend, he's injured. OK. The guy taking us into the woods went to get help and never came back. What was his name? Hank. I didn't get a last name. Hank? Do you know him? No. Pretty much everybody in these woods knows each other, but I've never heard of a Hank before. I need help. No problem. Just come inside. We'll call the Sheriff, and they'll send somebody to look for him, OK? Hey! Hey! Oh my god, I thought you left us! Sorry. I got a little turned around. These woods will do that to you, no matter how long you've been in 'em. Where is Sarah? She went to find you. Did you see her? Oh my god, no! Oh, shit! Let's get you out of here. Take the flashlight for me, would you? Yeah. OK, brace yourself. Here we go. Oh! Be careful. OK. Oh, all right, now we just have to find Sarah. Well, we're not doing anything tonight. Take this. Take this. Yeah, but she's here, so we should just find her. We will find her in the morning. Right now, we're getting out of here. Keep hoppin'. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Are you ready? OK, let's go. Yeah, let's go. OK. Yeah, Sheriff, his name is Alex Williams, 6'1", long hair. Yeah, his leg's busted up real bad. OK, yeah. Thank you, Sheriff. OK, how are you feeling? Any better? Thanks. They're gonna send somebody to look for him. They'll find him. Last year, there was an RV crash in the woods. Yeah, I remember that. I thought everybody died. I survived. So if you don't mind me asking, what brings you back here? I'm doing an article for my college newspaper. I'm looking for answers to questions I can't seem to figure out. My cousin Kelsey was also in the crash with me. No, I remember this. There was a huge search. But they never found her, right? Oh, hey, Sarah, you don't have to talk about this if you don't want to. No, it's OK. They never found her body, but I think she might still be alive. What makes you think she's still alive? I don't know. I just saw something that dragged her away. Jersey Devil. Crazy, right? No, no. I've been telling people about the Jersey Devil for years, but they just think I'm nuts. Is it real? Oh, yeah, it's real. I saw it once when I was a kid. I'll never forget. It's huge. Hooves for feet, fangs, but those horns... I think that's what I saw. Sarah, listen to me. The Jersey Devil is pure evil, and I've been hunting it ever since. Now who sounds crazy, right? No, not at all. In fact, I'm kind of relieved. All right, all right. All right, thank you. All right, come on. Hold it together. Right here. There you go! You all right? My leg is killing me. I think I got some aspirin over here. You got anything stronger? Yeah, whiskey. That'll do. All right. Here, put this on if you're gonna get cold. Thanks. Mm-hmm. Can I use your phone? Give me a second here. Thanks. Should we call the station? Shouldn't we have heard something by now? What was that? What's what? That sound. Ah, it's an old house. Probably just the furnace or something. Who knows? I know you heard that. Yep, that's the furnace. It's the oil moving through the pipes. It knocks when it gets fired up. Look, I'm really worried about Alex. The Sheriff will call us, Sarah. Maybe we should call them. It's dead. Look, phone lines go down around here all the time, all right? The wind picked up. It probably knocked some down. Well, I can't wait here. I have to go back out there and look for Alex. OK, well, hold on a second, Sarah. Slow down, all right? I don't want you going out there by yourself. Just let me grab a couple of things, and then we'll go, all right? Thank you. With everything you know about those woods, you're not scared? I know these woods like the back of my hand. And no, I'm not scared of the Jersey Devil. I suggest that if and when we find your friend, you two get out of here. You leave this place behind, and you never come back. I don't know if I could do that. You don't know what you're dealing with here. Sarah. I thought you said you're not afraid of any Jersey Devil. I'm not. You should be. You, your friend, you're something he'd like to possess. You seem to know a lot about this thing. I should. I've been studying the folklore for the better part of 10 years. Follow me. Where? Trust me, I just want to show you something. Then we'll go. Come on! I've been tracking the Jersey Devil for years. Is this what took your friend? No, it was different. If it was the Jersey Devil who took her, what does it want with her? Who knows. We should get going. Huh, that's dead. What? Can we use it to charge my phone? Sure, sure. Mm. Have a go. Now, how do you have the keys to this place? I'm the local handyman. I have keys to all these businesses. That way, when I repair something, I don't have to disturb the owners. Yeah. Yeah, OK. Don't worry. We're gonna find your friend. Yeah. Looks like the wood's cut. I think it's safe to say he's been rescued. We should head back, and we'll figure this out in the morning, OK? Come on. Hey, my phone's got some juice. Yeah. Yeah. No service. Yeah, it's spotty, like I said. So what do we do now? I'm going to drive over to the Sheriff's Office and see if we can pull together a search party for your friend. Hey, what's happening to me? No, you're all right, son. You're all right. Ease into it. You'll be all right, son. There ya go. Hey, I got him. Yeah, we'll meet you there. You almost screwed this up! It's not my fault this kid fell and broke his leg. We don't have much time! Tell me about it! The girl! Nah, he's got her. Dumbass kids. What were they thinking? They were gonna go into the woods with a total stranger, and nothing would happen. I don't... What do they call them, "millennials?" Come on, there. Gen Z'ers? Something like that. Oof, milleniyears? All right, let's go. Hey, how you doing? This is all my fault! Oh, whoa, whoa, Sarah! No, this is not your fault. Really? Yeah, what you're doing is really brave. Searching for your cousin like this, that's brave. Look, we will find Alex in the morning. I promise, OK? Just for now, just try to get some rest. Right. Oh, Hank, I don't feel good. Hank! Hank, I'm gonna throw up. Hank, I'm gonna throw up! Hank, I don't feel good! Hank, I'm gonna throw up! Hey, you better not throw up in there, kid. I'll make ya eat it. Ow! Oh! Where are you going? You idiot! Well, come on. It's not like he's gonna get very far. Go get him! Kid? You're gonna get yourself killed in there. No, no, no. Kelsey? Oh my god, what are you doing here? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hello? Hey, hey... You've turned into a right pain in my butt. You think you can outrun a bullet? Go for it. I missed you. Did you have a good nap? Eric said you needed to rest. I knew you were alive. I told everybody you were alive, and no one believed me. You look pretty. How did you get here? I don't remember much from the crash. This guy's crazy? Who, Eric? No, he's nice. Kels, he's been holding you hostage, and he has me hostage now. He took care of me. It's not his fault! Then whose fault is it? It was going to kill me. Jersey Devil. Doesn't exist. It's a costume. I saw. What costume? Kels, this is a bad person. Look at you, your face! Eric said I looked beautiful. You do look beautiful. He said I was as beautiful as a flower. He said we're family. I'm your family, remember? I'm your cousin. Well, I'm here now. I'm so scared. That's OK. We have to get you out of here. Stay here. I'm not getting in there. You better get in that truck, or your leg ain't gonna be the only thing that's hurtin'. Where's Sarah? Eric? Eric? Come quick! Kelsey, what's... She won't wake up. What happened to her? Kelsey! Kelsey! Come on, you know me! Kelsey, what are you doing? I can't leave. Eric is good to me. He's my brother. No, he's not. Kelsey, we have to go. I can't leave my brother like that. What are you saying? This is my home. I can't leave. Kelsey! Evening, Reeds. Evening. Oh, you found her. Nah, she found us. All right, let's get her inside. I have another one. Hey! Be careful with that one. Oh, look you survive the woods. Sarah's been awfully worried about you! Hey, shut up, or I'll knock you out again. Eric, shut him up! Alex! Alex! Sarah? Oh! I thought you were dead. I thought you were dead. What the hell is going on? I found Kelsey. What? I found her. She's alive. She's here. Where are we? I don't know. Some place in the Pine Barrens. I think this has something to do with the land dispute between us and the Reed family. We have to get out of here. What... where is Kelsey? In the basement. But we have a bigger problem. What? She doesn't wanna leave. How could you lose her? Me? I was here alone. Hank took forever. Where were you? What do you mean, you were here alone? What was your problem? You had one... How was it... You had one... Shh! Stop, stop, stop, stop! They could hear us! This has become a much bigger problem than we anticipated. Let's get rid of 'em. If people know that they were coming here, people will come looking for them, all right? And we don't know if they sent an email to a friend, or the newspaper. You're right. She did come here to do a story. Jersey Devil got 'em. That's what I'm thinking. The story worked for us before. There's two of 'em this time. We take 'em out one at a time. And Kelsey? She's with us. She's one of us now. It's not like she remembers anything anyways. I say we end them now. You know what? I am sick of the Franklins. They have caused us so much pain! We end them Jersey Devil style, leave their bodies in the woods. The cops don't even care anymore. So true. They're so eager to pin this on animals. They don't want to go searching the Devil territory. Are we in agreement? All right. All right, I'm going to go back. I gotta cover some tracks. Get this done. We have to find Kelsey fast. Sarah, I have to be honest. My leg isn't doing very good. I mean, I might be able to make it out of the house, but I don't think I can make it through the woods. We have to get to their car. Lay down. Lay down. Lay down right here. It's time for the Jersey Devil to wreak havoc on these kids. Hey, where's Alex? I'll go to the car. You find Kelsey. Let's go. Keys, keys, keys. Keys. Oh my god, Kelsey? I can't believe it's you. Oh my god! Wait. Who are you? Kelsey, it's me, Alex. I'm your boyfriend. I don't have a boyfriend. I don't know who you are. It's OK. Sarah came out here to find you. But we have to find her, and we have to leave, OK? I missed you. Look out! I have had enough of you! You people have ruined our lives for centuries. Drop the pipe! Let us go! This isn't our fight. Your family has lied for years, taken our land, taken everything that is sacred to us. Not anymore. Drop the pipe! Where's Kelsey? Where is Kelsey? Where's Kelsey?
