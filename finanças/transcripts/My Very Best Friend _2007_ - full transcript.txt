The Castle in Spain Director- Isabel Doval Toro! -You did it on purpose, didn't you? -did what? If you kept turning side way like this, you would by dead by now! I know the audience's needs.They want a thrill! Spaniard- That's who I am! Well then.. Watch out, Spaniard! -You're crazy! -And you are dead! Again? Isn't it enough of it? Esteban, come here! We need good players. - Dad, i don't want to! That's not his cup of tea. we need a sportsman! That's cunning, but we all must play. Watch the goal keeper. Get ready as if to kick the ball but miss it. Then Manolo runs to it and kicks, got it? Understand? -Did you watch that love story movie? -I am sick and tired of it. All episode so repetitive. So what? About time to get used to it. ?um, Jean is in love with John. But John loves Marie, Jean, ???? ???????. When Jean learns about it....poor Jean! Stop playing on your mum's nerves! You should go to an art collage. -He's got the talent. -Why don't you go? Because you can't make a living by acting. Anthony Baneras earns money. Do you know how? He works, works and nothing but works. You got it after your mum. All you want is to be on all posters and famous. If you work hard - you get there. Otherwise life will pass away uneventfully. -Do you know how they make ham? ...from cat's flash. -What's wrong with you? -he said that ham is made out of cat's flash. -What kind of talk is this? -He said so! No, That doesn't worry me... You're quite different. I can not get used to it and that worries me. It's stupid but i just got used to peaceful life. And with you is that constant hustle and bustle.. ..Let's go here...or there.. then again...elsewhere.... All the time something new... Look, I can promise you an uneventful live if that is what you want... Stop it, you make me confused. Are you sure that I confuse you? no.. not you. It's me.. We better break up. That's sad...very sad, truly. Leave the umbrella alone! -At least take the ball..I carry everything!. -Why don't you stay with us for dinner? -OK, but not for too long. See you tomorrow. -hello, mum! -Thank you again. -Will you come with us again next Sunday if weather permits? -But of course. We have different plans for the next Sunday. -See you. -Thanks, see you. -So, how was it? -Excellent! As usual, Luis with friends sang Spanish songs. And we organized bullfight with Esteban. I was a bull and almost killed him. Incredible!.. Will you eat? He wrongly turned sideway towards me. -So, it was quite easy. Can you imagine this? Toreador... -Maxsim, have a look at your pants! take them off and go to shower! But Luis is difficult to overcome. He is very strong. -usually Luis... -Tell me later. Go wash yourself. Ok, mum. Hello. Well, am going. -Maxim's cloth is all dirty. He was tumbling on the grass. -I did not!. Don't worry, i will wash them. That's good. -Till the evening, Maxim. Don't forget the keys! -I won't. -Hello! -Hello! off we go. Bye!..he plays soccer, like his father. Doesn't work!. what's wrong with the lift?! Constantly broken down. That's not a problem. I'll use the stairs. All the best! - I will look after him - Thank you, Luna! -How is work? All OK? -yes. -Good morning! -See you, mum! So, in an imaginary paradise of this sad world. Esteban Marquez discovered a revelation To the question; "What is the main legacy of the ancient world".. Exteban answers: "Approximately 200-250 thousand euros" It seems, that you perceive the college as a prison. Based on all the nonsense, you've said from the beginning of the year... you'll not only fail to escape from it But you'll also increase the sentence by half So..the result is "unsatisfactory". That's too expensive! Esteban! Come for a moment. Wait! -What's up? -Job to do. We can make money. Be ever so careful. Careful! -Cough when you finish-cough. -OK. -Hello. -Hi. Are you a track driver? Nope.. dancer. I meant..professional, you know.... Yeah, professional, you know... Understand. -Beautiful building...I wonder..what era, do you think? -what? Well, you, as a professional, you should know. -Listen, kid, i am working... -Hang on! I think, you are curious. This is not just a plain style. The walls and balconies- Looks like Ottoman style and the rest - Australian style. Especially windows. -The Wood is malington. Malington...that's... -Yeah, Alright! Understand. And doors...Uanchous. -Are you Finn? -No, i don't drink Alcohol. Don't worry. Repeat: Uanchous. Uanchous. Fantastic doors. Anyway, I got to go. -Nice to meet you, what is your name? -Jack. -Jack, you are my friend now - see you. -See you. What a bore! -have a look. -Very good! -We need to hide it... -Sure Bloody hell! Mother! -I will cover you up. -OK! - There they are. - Hello. What are you hiding? What have you done this time? Nothing mum. -Mum, you know...about your hands? -What about them? They are so beautiful! I have never noticed before. Both of them! -By which hand should i slap you? The left or the right one? -Why? Let's go. Stop making fool out of me She almost smack me.. What can you do! But what a good fatch!. If anything - we visited Lafayette galleries. Or Prentan. No, w Lafayette galleries. -OK, let's go. What a beautiful shawl! -Hello, Maxim! -hello! Hope, I'll see you soon? -We'll come over your place for aperitif. -Really? -Hello, Lucy! -Hello Esteban! What a cool sneakers! They suits you. -Do you think so? -Yes. Mum wanted me to take pink, But i prefer blue. That's right! Blue is 10 times better. Pink...well...not really... And panceau suits you. -Are you going? -Yes, one moment. -All the best! -See you! One day i will marry her. She is cool! And she looks like a Spaniard. I am terribly hungry. -Manolo, we need to tell you something. -What? We decided to sell you. We need money. We will take you to the market tomorrow morning. You will see that this butcher is quite a nice bloke. What's now? what is the problem? -He wants painapple juice. -OK, then why scream for? -Hello! -Hello,dad! So... who complained about you today? Stop crying, Manolo! Stop it! That's enough! What happened? I don't want to go to that butcher! -What is the story this time? -Take the juice. I don't want to! Well then... we go. -Don't stay in the basement the whole day long! later start doing your homeworks, OK? -OK. -Did you hear what mum said? -yes. It's about time that you start getting good marks. you will be doing the homework yourself and not Max for you. Maxim only makes an exercises. -No more of it, understand? -Understand. So, your father was a guitarist in a group of flamenco. And your mother - his biggest admirer. When she looking at him playing, she forgets everything else. Ok, good. Just wait. Your mother then was in England? -Do you think she could talk like this? -let's start from the beginning. -It disturbs me. -No.. wear it. Why i would still it for, ha? Well, it was you who wanted to make her a surprise! She likes it. Come on, practice!. They are either parallel or perpendicular. They can not be both. Here, read the answer to the question. -Do you think i have a chance with Lucy? -What? Just piss on her! That's enough, ok?! Where is you maths book? Shit! I left at home. - I will go for it. - No need, I will. Meanwhile try to work it out. It's easy. When are you leaving? In July? Yes, at the beginning of July. It's better. Esteban and Manolo..They will finish school. And how are you going to manage it? Dangle between Saint-Jacques and Bilbao? There is 55 km between them. I am not going to travel there and forth. We leave the House in Santiago de Compostela. That's our castle. I am so happy to return home. Are you going to tell this to Estaban and Manolo? No, not until the end of school year. I relay on you! Not a word! I am reading and reading and can't grub that shit. I will do it for you. How do you like my cocktail? That's coca-cola and pineapple juice... Tasty! What? Never mind. Maxim, boys..go to your room to play. You will feel more comfortable over there. -No, Mum. -And i said: YES. -Your English is not that bad. -What about my English? -How are you going with Erick? -He left yesterday. Saying that he needs a break. -I will try to do the same. -I'll call Gilbert. Why would you want to ring Gilbert? Didn't you leave him? Everything between you too has finished. -So, if you don't mind... -Of course I DO mind! I didn't think that you would take an advantage of the situation. I don't take an advantage of anything Gilbert - he is a great guy, so... But he is my friend! Are you going to sleep with my ex-boyfriend? -If he is your EX-boyfriend... -What?! Ex..that means EX... Fine. I will not tie up with Gilbert. Don't touch my stuff! -And what are you doing with Ecteban in the attic? -That is our business. Can I go to have a look? If you go - you'll die! Fine. What are you doing? We agreed that you will wait for me downstairs. Yesterday evening my parents chucked such a fit. I have no idea what got into them. Alright, forget it. Look at him! - That's not fair! - Why not? I've done everything right! - OK then, stop it. - Fine, let's go play. Maxim, come here. What's the matter with you? -Let's go playing! -I don't want to. What?!. Chicken out, don't you? Just watch me! -Slow down! What is wrong with you? -Nothing! We spent an hour in the infirmary to find out where he lives. And you are silent! Just go with your friends and forget me! Why are doing all this?! We are doing exactly as you dad said. Pass it back! -Maxim - have you seen Ectaban? -No!! Maxim, I would like to ask you... -No. -What's up with Maxim? Did you have a fight? Not really. I don't know what's wrong with him. Isn't Maxim coming for lunch? What is up with you two? Are you quarreling? No .. Dammit! Dear... Mum... where have you been? In the office. I am busy at the moment. Wait, I'll cook a broth. Go to bed. -They are leaving. -What? -They are moving to Spain. -No... I heard them talking about it. Luis is going to coach a team in the first division in Bilbao. They are leaving in a month. I don't want Esteban to leave. I am sure that he will be happy to return to Spain. He often remembers his friends, his home... family, the sun... Estaban has been born here! He is French! French and Spaniard. he was growing up her but he also is a Spaniard just as his parents are. Imagine... that you've always lived in Burkina Faso... That is not your country... Ee.. well.. you were happy to live there. Happy to go to school, meet friends, you were true Burkinese Burkina faso... Burkina...in general... if i would propose to you... to return to your country That is exactly the same for the family Markesov. They love France... But they also love Spain. That is their native country. And you make new friends! Go to sleep. It's already late. -But mum... -Go to sleep! Burkina ... They are called "residents of Burkina Faso". It must be very sexy. It must be dropped lower. Let the neck cut to be right to the bottom. Yes, but stay still, or else it falls apart I will make you a gorgeous cleavage. -Everything is OK with you, dear? -yes. Why are you alone? where is Maxim? What has happened between you two? Let me in. I've been left out without a bull. They stopped rehearsals. If you think I am not attentive enough I promise I pull myself together. Besides, I like acting as if I'm my mother. Oh, please! Maxim! Let me in. And now have you started talking to a door? Esteban! What is your problem? Tell me, what is it all about? Will we play soccer in the evening? Frederic comes. Markesy against Markesy. Long time since we played soccer together. really? You are quiet as always? Monsieur Galie, stop calling his wife names Learn to control yourself. Yes, of course. OK, See you Mr. Galie.... Maxim! School director called me. What have you done this time? Why did you bash up your mate? he started it! If there as differences of opinion between friends there are better ways to solve them You disgraced me. I warn you! If it happens again -there will be no more TV or any other entertainments I piss on TV! You can chuck it away! Fuck that! How dare you to talk like this?! And don't say that puberty is the reason for your behavior. -I have no time at the moment... -You never have time for me!.. Yes. ?a... Hello. No, I will not come. All will be decided tomorrow. Your client wants more maintenance payment. If you manage to raise up over 1500, I will invite you for dinner. 2 thousand Euro- that's not bad at all. I thought that judge would grant more. It doesn't matter. Most important that we got divorce. and I will be able to see my son again. Thank you, attorney. And yet- what a mongrel she is!! - Monsieur Galie, please,stop it! No need for it. I understand but i just can't control myself. She is a bastard indeed! Good bye Ms. An excellent confrontation. I liked it. Initially i wanted to prove more, but then I decided... -Enough. -Congratulations! You were very convincing. Sarcastic. Once sharp, then benign. Well presented yourself. With an open smile. Of course, all that well prepared ... In my opinion, the judge appreciated it. My artistry. Another words, I won a dinner. Tonight? OK. Maxim, are you here? I would like to show you something. Come out. I have something for you. I found a crystal ball. You were right. This is class! Great ball! You are leaving for Spain at the end of the month. Well, yes.. as always - for holiday. -You are leaving for ever! -What? They are going to tell you this on the eve of the holiday. But i can not hold it secret anymore. Already?.. -Very strange. -What? They always wanted to return to Spain. They were talking about it long time. But they wanted to wait until i become 18. That how it should be!.. -That's right... -That is all you can say? We will never see each other and your are glad about it? But we will be seeing each other! Crazy! You will be coming on holidays. You will like our castle. Parents decided about everything. What can I do? You must understand... In live you don't always do what you want to do. But you can't just leave. Esteban doesn't want to..Tell them! Yeah..no..... Anyway... I don't care. -It does not make us happy. -Not true! You're saying that you don't want to leave. But if it does not make you happy... no body forces you to leave! Luise, you are capable..to be an assistant of a coach. Every coach has an assistant. I have long been working with Laurent. And he doesn't want to part with me. So don't I. With him. -Nothing can be done. Sorry. -Can't he stay with Enrique? After all Enrique remains in France. Enrique is 21. He's on the second year of architecture He has his own apartment in France. He lives with a Frenchwoman. Esteban can also live with a Frenchwoman. He is in love with Luise. he even wants to marry her. -Stop that -He wants to become an actor. In Santiago de Compostela, he will never become an actor. He will, he will...No body knows what becomes of him. Right now he doesn't even want to study. Maxim, that's enough! I am leaving for work and my family goes with me. As for you - you can come to Spain any time you want. That's it. Period! Maxim. I understand his mother completely.. -And i don't. -Really? - Strange. - Fine. I like to impress -It may seem presumptuous, but... - yeah..yeah. It can be. I know. whatever it is...it so happens that wherever I go I feel that people pay attention to me. I just transform the place wherever I go. I was told this quite often. The values are not in the external look. Of course, the appearance plays it's role. But it is not the main attribute.. No, it is something.... something... Much more deeper But of course!. Depth. My external appearance and my inner world... They are in complete symbiosis. -Such thing does not happen too often. -No, dear..i won't come any time soon. We'll meet tomorrow. Kissing you, Maxim. I am shocked... -By my abilities... -Going to your place? -yeah... -I never make love to monkeys... -Luis! -What are you doing here? Why aren't you asleep? I am going to the chemist. Manolo has a headache. And high temperature. Poor Manolo! Luis, you are a good father... Going to a Chemist at 3 o'clock in the morning... for medicine. Are you OK? And you are a good husband... I want to have my own husband. Antoine died 10 years ago. It's time to close the pages of the past. We can't indulge in sorrow for ever. But i can't otherwise... Just can not. There was a lot of talking for a long time about it, Gradina That exhibition..it is your chance. Who knows.. maybe today is your lucky day. Good morning, dear! -Where were you yesterday? -Just wait, i have to take an aspirin. My guest today is Jerome Lambert, a talented director. Hello, Jerome! hello, i called you "Ramzhe". Jerome, at present you are working on a great musical, which will be ready for viewing in November in Paris, correct? -That's correct. -And you've come here to search for suitable artists... Yes. Careful, don't damage decorations! -We are looking for a boy... -Turn down, please. ...For a main role. he should be around 9-13 y.o., be able to sing and dance and act on the stage..

In order to sign in for an audition. Thank you so much, Jerome! By the way. do you know how would it be "Jerome" in Japanese? -No. -"Jerome"! What is this discussion all about? Any problem? Somebody's died? No.., about nothing specific...just chattering away... see you! That's OK. Fuck you two! He follows us! I know, i saw him getting out of the bus. Hello Mister. Where can if find out about the auditions? -Why are you screaming? I am not deaf! -Somewhere here is going to be... Casting for boys 9-13 y.o.. Which are able to act on the stage and sing and dance? You always talk like that? Or only when something amuses you? Musical - comedy. That is something! It looks like a hoax. The camera is hidden,aa? -Really? no?.. - Hidden camera... No, we are in regards to an auditions. Do you need professional actor or not? Understand. Improvisation. You have played it well. Okay, Now I'm busy. Bye! Maybe in my place..Esteban?!. We need practice... Esteban wants to have a talk? -So how are you going here? Can we have a chat? -Yes. Excuse me ,I'll be back. In regard to the selection of actors Why didn't you tell me anything? I could show you a sketch. What for? This is what I need! I know it all. I will make it. You know it! You are going to Spain.. You will not make it. Fuck that! If i get the role.. parents would not be able to go anywhere! Ok then. Except I Just do not know how Arsen will take it... -No worries - I will tell him! -No, I will. Wait. No! No! But we agreed! You made me angry. Good boy! OK.. hold it. Good. Don't worry! OK. Well, What? Look at him. Well, he's taken the money. All is OK. I only dumped him for you. Ok, let's go Who is it? what do you want? What are you doing? None of your business! Get out! Oh, please!.. Hello! hello, Esteban! - Can i get in? - Yes, of course. No! I said: No! Let her in! That is not serious! Why don't you find yourself girlfriends and play dolls with them? -We are busy. -I am sick and tired! You always like this to me... Yes. Why you are like that to Lucy? She is cool! Stop bothering me! Fine, let's go. Start?. Ready? Move to the right! To the left! You have nr 26. Well, how do you feel? Normal. Let's go then. We must take the number. 44. Go! that's us. Hello! -Hello! Name, Surname, age.. - Esteban Markes. I didn't get it. You have a poor articulation Esteban Markes, 11 years 5 months and 2 weeks old. -Were are your parents? -parents? -Yes, dad and mum... -She is a solicitor.. she supposed to come but.. They rang her from the court and stuff... Decisions, pressure, urgent business, well, she couldn't come. That's why we're alone. Next time we will come with mum! Did you understand? You must come with mum or dad. I can't let you go. We have just said: she could not come! No need to argue with me! It's useless. -Estabon... -Esteban! -And I am saying: Estebon!.. Get out! Stop with that chewing gum! Who is next? Who? What a recalcitrant!. She obviously doesn't know whom she messes with! We will stick to the original plan but the other way around. You'll distract her, and i snick in to the hall. She will bash us up! We change our appearances. I wear a wig, glasses... And i will be your mother? There is one option. Extremely effective. Hmm...not bad... -I haven't say anything! -Then talk! Why hesitating? You play on my nerves! OK, listen. -We simply... -Yeah.. quite simply! I am convinced that Luna will appreciate it. She won't find out You just pretend to be her... -And when Esteban passes..you won't be needed anymore. -Just like that?! Can i learn whose head this fantastic idea came from? -Be persuaded... -Maxim, forget the whole thing! Mum! i am telling you!.. I am a lawyer. And you are forcing me to lie. I can be punished for this!. As I just said... that's it! enough! -It's getting on my nerves! -You would never do anything for me! We with Ectaban are always together. I don't have father. And my mother... ..sort of "is" around...then again - she is not. When Estaban leaves- whom i will stay with? Shit... RCT, Damn it! -RCT? -Recalcitrant! Mum! My mum takes care of Maxim since his early childhood. So you can take care of me... At least once in the life time! Esteban.. leave it please! Frankly speaking - you are a good mum... He has a mental break down, he is on the brink.... On the edge of a canyon. -Rocky mountain.. -Get out! Bloody hell! OK.. I thought... - Just get out of here! Maxim! stop it! You have done your share, and that's enough for now. Mum, I need you! I am working. I don't want him to go Only you can help us. You said that i can have plenty of friends. But Estaban is to me more than a friend. he is my brother. Obviously, you don't understand this... You have never been around when we needed you. You would never go on picnic with us. Even though Luna always kept inviting you. You've never gone to soccer match when Luis's team played. The team always played fantastically. Whenever we had fun or being happy- you were not with us. Even when there was a match with Real Madrid. You had different things to do. And i wanted you to be together with us! That would be cool! You were not there whenever i needed you. And today... I simply need you... For me it is necessary! In this case... I am asking you! Maxim! I repeat: "No" means "No"!! -Are You mother?.. - Yes! I am Luna Markes. I am a.... Ecteban Marke's mother... and... Maxim's. And I can cook very well... and... In my opinion, cooking here... -So, it is Ecteban Markes, 11 y.o. 5 months and 2 weeks, yes? -Yes. Write in your details here so we can contact you... You can go. Ectabon, you stay! You will go on backstage Me too, i am also your brat. But your mother- is not my mother! That's my aunt! And your brat - Lui! My name is Karanten. Even though everybody thinks my name is Lui. In fact that's you not me! thanks Lui! I mean.. Karanten.. I don' know any more! They give you an answer withing few days. -How many? -26. Next. Yes, next one. Ecteban Markes. -Hello, Esteban! -hello! Did they explained to you what is needed? -I describe you the character, the situation and you start, OK?? -OK. So.. You're the leader of the bandits... who learns that his gang had just made an unsuccessful attempt of robbery. He panics. No, now it begins Look, he stands motionless. -well?... -Shut up! Geppetto, I've got to tell you something important ... Geppetto!... Geppetto, Geppetto...Geppetto You've let me down badly... Ernesto, come here!.. Closer! Why are you crying? -Ernesto, Ernesto, Ernesto... -Thanks, Esteban, thank you! We leave the poor Ernesto alive... They give you an answer within few days. Not bad at all! well...yes. Geppetto, Geppetto, Geppetto... - Cool dialog - They'll send a letter to parents. Mum, don't worry! It will be OK. yeah, of course.. such a little things! They soon give an answer. Next audition could be in one week. We need to see the postman every morning... -Instead of going to school. -No! I will take care of it. And you go to school and don't do anything silly! And what will you do? -I don't know.. i think of something. -That's good. Looks like you'll have to stay with us. Yeah, seem like it -So we can practice in peace. -yeah. -So your mum will not learn that my mum acts as yours. -Of course. That's enough! Get out. -We are happy to see you. -So am I. What an aroma! This is "paella". It is you who created this miracle thing? Dress? Yes, but it's not finished it yet. -It will take many months. Hellish work! - hang on... -Emma, you wanted to talk to us? -Yes. Maxim would like Ecteban to stay with us until your depart. Well.. that will be troublesome for you They see each other every day anyway. That's enough. The problem is not with me or with you. Problem is that.. the separation is going to be painful for them I know that and you also know that. We all know this. Imminent separation of two friends ... oh, What am I saying!? two brothers! They are now in an urgent need of living together. Not to separate even for one minute! Not even for one second! Now they are living side by side, but... Soon there the huge distance will separate them. Think about it! Listen to the voice of your heart. I believe that it gives you an answer which they are awaiting. OK.. Esteban, go to your parents. It was not easy for your mum to allow you to stay with us. Also your father wants to talk to you. thanks, mum. Why don't you want to write a poem for her? Did you loose you brain?! With my horrible writing? That's easy! You hair - it's a gold... My heart ripped open... But her hair is not golden! -Most importantly: she is good! -not at all, she is boring! That's not her fault. OK then.. Your hair is like a night... pitch-black night - to a tee! Ok, but maybe?.. Your eyes are so radiant... I am dazzled by their treacherous luster. Or: I love your purple scarf. it's so cool! When you put your beret, you are as if in bloom! Sleep! What do you do with Lucille? I mean to say... Like, you would say you love her... then what do you feel? Every time i see her, i have a wish that she would stay. This is the key to the post office box, swap it with your mum's one, but be careful -So not body will notice it, OK? -OK. Hello! -Returned? Already missing your home? -no. Just dropped to get my books. Is Manolo in his room? Of course. Where else could he be? -But you don't miss fashion house? -No. I work for myself. -Realize many orders... - do you mean "private"? Yes. What happen? Nothing! That's because of the train toy. I accidentally stepped on it. Manolo! Stop it! Manolo says that you stepped on it deliberately! -Me? yes! Did you read the letter? Madam! We are happy to inform... -That your son, Ecteban Markes... -That's me!.. Has been invited to attend next audition for our future TV program. Please, find enclosed recorded music pieces... Based on which you son will be able to prepare himself... to perform a choreographic piece. Choreographic, Esteban... Mum, you used to dance. Can you us show some steps? -No, I am a lawyer. -That's OK but you were a dancer!.. -You must remember something. -Stop it! I am not a dancer! hello! Hello, colleague! Did I disturb? No, I am with my girlfriend. With girlfriend? I am all the time thinking about our last togetherness... Perhaps we meet again? -Sorry but during on coming days i will be busy with my son. Then perhaps at a latter time, some time?... Well...OK If only you knew how my body... What kind of dance do they want? What do you say? Is it OK? Gloomy. Just wait, I spread the curtains. There you are! Welcome! And what are you doing here? - Lot of things... Practicing, improvising... Maximus, why are my clothes here? I searched for them. True, actually why they are here? Stop that.. don't play dummy. Mum, don't be angry! We're just preparing a gift... For on-coming wedding of Luny and Luisa. Basically you can train Esteban here. here is quiet - Do you know to dance at all? - of course I do! -Get the music. -Thanks Do you know what's the time? Wake up! Esteban, frankly speaking you don't know how to dance. -I do. -No, you don't. -Yes, I do! Your movements had nothing to with dancing. I was practicing. Really? A lot? -Yes, every day. -Really, every day? Seems you need some more practice You danced like a psycho! i don't know.. Something got into my head... Maxim, stop harassing him. Simply.. there was a heat around so he wore it. That was very funny. Good night! Good night! I am sorry. Forget it. -catch! -What is it? wait. Mum, can you leave, please! Ok..OK!... - What is it? - What is it, what is it... For Luise. No. No, no. No. I can't take it. If i was an idiot i would give you flowers... Exactly, so beautiful.. As you are yourself... If only... I could be those yearly seasons... In the summer I would blow a cool breeze... To keep you comfortable... If i was those seasons... I would give you eternity... full of love and joy... And safe... And in my life You would be the happiness... Bu me would be just me... At lewat accept my heart... Beautiful! Esteban died. What did you do to him? Nothing... he is so pale!
