How is the injured child? I'm going straight into the lake. Shouldn't Louise be here? Maybe she's working. It creeps me out. Hello? Nothing unusual. It'll come back. Take this. Stop moving, Titi. We can't see a thing. Stay there. Don't touch. Look. A chess board. Titi, please. - Remember anything, Bas? - A little. Beer? Sure. We're here. Where are you? You're crushing me. Chloe isn't in but we're here with the kids. Pick a bed. I just don't want... to... ...fall. Do all rooms smell stuffy? I don't know. The heat is killing me. Chloe looks as tidy as you are. We're going for a swim. Come for a dip at least. Watch out. My love. Finally. - Then you lose the sense of smell. - It decreases. - Hello you. - Hi. Good to see you. How are you? Fine and you? - You look good. All grown-up. - Thanks. Mom? Where's my Switch? It should be on the piano, sweetheart. - Are you okay, Titi? - Yes? You look depressed. Thanks. Come here. Have you been eating chips? I'm thirsty. I want some juice. Didn't Chloe wake you up last night, guys? No. It's not my fault they're in my room. How old are you now, Bastien? 13. Turning 14. - Already? - 14... My God. I thought the age gap between you was bigger. Chloe, how old were you last time? 10, 11? Yeah. Hi Chloe. Hi. What's wrong? What a fucking witch. I just like wearing leggings. They look small. Chlo? Chloe? - What? - Come down. - Take the boys to the pier. - Later. Now. Or no cellphone for 24 hours. I'll fucking kill her. Look. Wow. Seriously, Titi? - Yes. - Where did you find it? Over there. That's worth a lot in Paris. - We are going to be rich. - Rich. The whole family, I hope. Get me a full bucket of them. Okay? Small ones are more expensive. The water is not that warm. You don't have to drink it. - Do you often do that? - What? - Do you often do this? - Offer people drinks? Make things up to get rid of your brother. All the time. Don't you have a phone? No. I'll get one when I turn 14. Coming? Yeah. It's cold. Why do you keep your shirt on? I don't think I'm going to swim. Are you scared the ghost might grab you? Didn't you know about the ghost? I don't believe in ghosts. They found a kid's body in the wild part of the lake. Maybe he's just dead. Why should he be a ghost? Because it was an accident. I just don't like swimming. Why not? When I was younger, I almost drowned so... Apparently, it's fun to drown. Really? When you hold your breath underwater, your lungs contract. So when you need to inhale, your lungs fill with water and it feels amazing. Too bad I missed that. I took several. I don't look dead enough. I'm the one who sold him the house. It's good. Wrong pipe. We spent our childhood at the cabin. You like chilling with the kids? Yeah... No. Come. Who shit their pants? You're taking mini-sips. Such good wine. Let me see your hand. Your hands are tiny. Yours is huge. It's not normal. Look. It feels weird, right? It's like touching a corpse. You know too much weird stuff. Don't you? What? Weird stuff? Yeah. I do. Like what? I don't know if it's weird but you can't bite yourself until you bleed. It's physically impossible. I don't believe it. The pain stops you. It forces you to stop before you bleed. I'm sure I can do it. - You can't. It's impossible. - You just bite. In a survival situation, you might eat your hand, legs or feet. - What's up? - Hey. Can I have a smoke? Can I have some wine? Deal. Does he want one? - Do you have a light? - Yeah. Thanks. Who's the kid? Bastien. He's French. French? - Hello. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Lol. I heard you and Jackson broke up. None of your business. "None of your business." This is uncomfortable. Are you coming? Yeah. You almost fell. "Hello." "My name is Oliver." "I can speak a little French." "My aunt's dog is... ...yellow." Yellow? What do they teach you in school? Man, it's so hot. Fuck it, I need a swim. Fuck, I don't know. I don't know. There's something fucked up. I think it was the ghost, Chlo. - Not funny. - I swear. He was playing with my testicles like... Your English sucks. Admit you were scared. I'm going to head back. I'm going. As you like. See you. Fuck. - Did you follow me? - Maybe. Aren't you staying with the others? No. Wanna finish up? Yes. There you go. Now that's a big sip. - Did you throw up everything? - It's spinning. There's nothing coming out. Think about food. Gnocchi dripping with cheese. No. With red pesto sauce, sweet peppers... Pizza... I don't know, something gross. You're gonna puke? You're going to puke. Are you okay? Come. Let's get you cleaned up. Raise your arms. Open your mouth. Hold this. The hair salon is open, sir. Tilt your head. Three years? How is that possible? Did I say three? I haven't paid taxes for four years. That's your hippie side. Honestly, it's... I'd be so nervous. My plan is to die before I have to pay. Careful, it's lava. It eats you. No Mom and Dad to save you. No. Will you stop eating my chips? - Promise? - Yes. Or I'm letting go and you'll disappear. - No more eating my chips? - Yes. Titi? - Dad, I have a question. - What? - Don't you suck at this? - I do. So what? Bastien, pass the ball. He's being a smart ass. Come here. Watch out. Sorry. It's a girl's bike. - Do you care? - It sucks. - Why? - Forget it. It's a very good bike. Is it true somebody drowned here? Where? In the wild part of the lake. Louise? Did someone drown in the lake? Don't listen to Chloe. She makes things up to get attention. - Are you putting onions? - Yes. Please don't, I'll burp forever. That's how you save me? By yelling at me? Wanna come to a party with me? Bastien? Yes? Do you see a black top on my bed? I don't know. Is that what you're wearing? It's all I have. Do you have like a short-sleeve shirt? No. Not bad. Try it. I can't wear this. - I'll look like a tourist. - Try it. Watch out, I'm fit. Little girls will go crazy. Little girls? Turn around. - I've seen breasts before. - You have to earn it. - Are you done? - No. So you push people when you get scared? - I'm kind of a hotshot. - Right. - Bas? - Yes? Be home by midnight. I throw punches if I'm startled. Do you think you'll become one? A ghost? Yeah. I don't think you get to choose. Some ghosts don't realize they're dead. They weren't ready to die. They still live among us but can't communicate. Except with you. You won't puke tonight, will you? - I'll be watching. - It was something I ate. Yeah right. - Do you want a beer? - Yeah. Sorry. I need to pee. Any cute girls? We just got here. What's your type? The first thing you look at? The hair. The hair? I like blondes. I'm not sure if I find it disgusting or hot. Don't you like hairy women? - The kid wants to see. - You do? Good luck. Don't watch. It's gross. You're a genius, man. What did he say? He says we look alike. No. How can you wear this? I can't breathe. Have you seen Jackson's new girl? She's so hot. Where? The blonde in a multicolor shirt. Coming? Come on. Hi. Aren't you asleep? No. What about Titi? I think he is. What did you do? I listened to some music. How was the party? After you left, people stopped dancing and the neighbors complained about the noise. - Really? - Yeah. You should have stayed. It was better with you. You have to teach me how to dance. I saw my ex. - The good-looking guy with the blonde? - Yeah. Why did you break up? Shit. Come into my bed. Come so we don't wake Titi up. You suck at this. I don't think so. What was your question? Why did you break up? Because. Because? Because he's a jerk. Okay. He wanted me to do things with him I didn't want. So he broke up. Then, he told everyone we'd done it. What a jerk. Have you done it? Yes. Okay. Actually, no. Okay. Do you find that weird? What do you mean? My friends have all done it. It's not weird. We bleed the first time. Don't you find that disgusting? Titi gets a lot of nosebleeds. I'm used to it. How can you even compare? I don't mind. Do you want to sleep? If you like. Stay. Go to the right. No, to your left. More. Two more steps. I'm hot. Last one. It's beautiful. Look, it's turning red. Look. It's purple. - Come on. - No. - Tell me. - No. - Tell me your biggest fear. - You first. - Afterwards. - No. - I swear. - No. - Why not? - Because you won't tell yours. I'll say mine. You swear? - Yes. - You swear? I swear. On your mother's life? On my mother's life. - For real? - Yes. On the count of three, we both say it. Let's do it. You have to say it, I'm not kidding. Not kidding. - So you'll say it? - Yeah I will. - Ready? - Yeah. Three... two... one... Jerking off in front of my parents. No? That's not true. You're joking. I swear. Bullshit. Would you like it? "Dad, Mom, forgive me." I wouldn't but it's not the worst. Titi dying in an accident... Balls cancer... - Serial killers... - No. Nothing compares to that. Really? I thought you'd say water. Water is nothing. - Really? - Yeah. Prove it. Okay. You are screwed. Satisfied? Further than that. The bottom feels gross. Go further. Further. Further. Further. Further. Almost. Are you okay? No. Do you want an ice cream? There is some downstairs. Okay. Here. Thanks. What happened? It doesn't matter. I don't fit in. That's my biggest fear. To feel alone my entire life. You're not alone. And you'll always have your ghost. Your biggest fear is way cooler than mine. Yours is the worst worst fear I've ever heard. Prove it. Open the door. What are you doing? Mom? - What are you doing? - Mom? What? What? What is it? Chloe? What's for dinner? Is that what you wanted me for? Rat. We're having rat. I haven't done this in ages. Same. What's the picture? Claude "Monette". Do you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend, Titi? I have four. Four? All in your class? Two from school. And two from my karate class. - And one from the swimming pool. - Yes. That makes five. Who's your favorite? The one you want to stay with forever? Clemence. - Who's Clemence? - I don't know her. - You knew they were coming? - No. It's cool. Come on, play the djembe. You want me to? I haven't shown Bryan yet. Mom, don't. She's amazing. Stop it, Chloe. You're terrible but you're making progress. I just started, but I'll be at that level eventually. Easy. You're dealing with a pro here. I need a drink. - Want anything, Bas? - Yes, please. - Here. - Thanks. Could he bite himself till he bleeds? No. I don't want you to leave. Me neither. Give it back. Give me my phone. A good sense of humor doesn't mean you won't get bored. He was handsome but he didn't make me laugh. His jokes were so bad they were like a stab to my heart. Show your jokes. Come on. Do this. It's so weird. I ate every pomegranate Can I get more wine please? Can you pour me a glass? First try. What time should we leave tomorrow? To get the car back in time, I'd say a glorious 6:30am. They look like rubies. Can't you postpone? I can't, I'm working. But you work from home. That's disgusting. Who are we talking about? Sam! You don't know him. I've heard about him. But I swear, there's no competition between you and Sam. - Well... - No! Pick up your plate. Everything okay? What is he saying? You're a fucking liar. Look who's here. What's up? Watching me pee? No. Not at all. - Stay with us. Drop your bike. - Why? Come live the dream. - You okay? - Yeah. You? It's not easy, uh? Are you uncomfortable? Don't go all "Houdini" on us this time. Tonight, you stay. Got it? Is it true that... you slept with Chlo? No way. The kid is here. What the fuck? - How are you? - Fine and you? Do you want a beer? Yeah, a beer. Coming right up, man. There you go, amigo. He was leaving on his bike. I told him not to play it like E.T. Should I light one up in the fire? Very clever, do it. What are you doing, man?! Stop that shit. I just want to fucking drink. Have you ever smoked? - Do you want to try? - Yes. Do you know how? Hold it. Hold it. Are you okay? Are you okay, Houdini? I think we're screwed. What do you mean? They're too busy to come back with more booze. Into the water. Bastien? Get over here. Bastien. I love you.
