Throw down and destroy all festive decorations; let the people of Judah clothe themselves in mourning! Minister of an angry God's wrath, the King of Assyria has fallen on us now! The horrible howlings of barbarian legions have thundered in the holy temple of God! Maidens, rend your white veils, raise your arms in supplication. The fervent prayer of innocent lips is a pleasing perfume in the nostrils of the Lord. Pray, maidens! Through you may come to naught the fury of the savage enemy legions! Almighty God, who fliest on the wings of the wind, who freest the lightning flash from the quivering cloud, disperse, destroy the legions of Assyria, let the daughter of David rejoice once more! We have sinned! But in heaven may our prayers obtain mercy and forgiveness for our frailty! Oh, let not the wicked cry with blasphemous presumption: "Does the God of Israel hide himself for fear?" Do not let thy children fall prey to a madman who scorns thy everlasting might! Do not permit the Assyrian foe to sit among his false idols upon the throne of David! Be of good cheer, my children! Almighty God in his might has vouchsafed a sign. He has delivered a precious hostage into my power. The offspring of the enemy king can bring us peace. The sun of a more propitious day has perhaps risen for us! Curb your fears! Place your trust in God's eternal help. There, upon the shores of Egypt, he procured Moses his life. Once he rendered invincible the hundred men of Gideon. Who, trusting in him, has ever perished in the hour of extremity? What cries are these? Furiously the Assyrian king advances. It seems he defies the whole world in his haughty arrogance! Heaven will perhaps put an end to his wicked endeavours. The foe shall not rest upon the ruins of Zion. I commit this first among Assyrian damsels to your care. Have mercy, O Lord! As night before the shining sun, as dust before the wind, thou shalt vanish in the hour oftrial, O false god of Baal. Thou mighty God of Abraham, descend and fight alongside us. In thy servants kindle a breath of fire that shall deal death... ...to the enemy. In thy servants kindle a breath of fire that shall deal death to the enemy. As night before the shining sun, as dust before the wind, thou shalt vanish in the hour of trial, O false god of Baal. Fenena! O my beloved! On the day of vengeance whoever heard talk of love? Unhappy girl! Oh, how much more beautiful you appear to my eyes now than when as ambassador to Babylon from Judah I came! You took me out of prison at grave risk to yourself, nor were you disturbed by the cruel and envious vigilance of your sister, who pursued me with a raging passion! Oh, why remind me? I am a slave here now! But I would unlock the way to freedom for you! Unhappy man! Now you are betraying a sacred duty! Come! You also betrayed it for me. Come! My heart will open to you... the way through thousands. Soldiers, the temple is taken! Abigaille! Valiant soldier! Do you know no other arms save those of love? In the heart of an Assyrian maid such a flame seems wicked to me now! What god will save you? Your tomb will be your bridal couch. The thunderbolt of my revenge already hangs suspended over your heads! I loved you! I would have given my kingdom and my heart for your heart! This love is a raging fury; it can give you life or death. If you love me I might yet save your people! Ah, no! I will render you up my life but my heart I cannot give. I am content with my fate but cannot fear for myself. Ah! I call upon thee now, I recognize thee now, true God of Israel! This love is a raging fury. Let my tears speak for my people. Not for my sake in the hour of trial should you be moved by my prayer. Oh, if you love me I might yet save your people! Only protect my brother and condemn me to weeping! You saw him? Like thunder he bursts into the thick of the fray! Brandishing his bloody sword he is heading this way! In vain the soldiers offer their breasts as shield to the holy temple! Our prayers and our tears are accursed in the sight of the Everlasting! Happy the man who has not lived to see this day! Behold the king! Upon his steed he makes his way to the temple like a whirlwind that brings everywhere black ruin in its train. What presumption! He does not even dismount from his furious charger! Calamity, alas! Who now will defend the temple of the Lord? Long live Nabucco! Hail! Who opened the way to the scoundrel? False attire! Pride will not help: the king comes this way! What are you about? Oh, tremble, madman! This is the house of God! What is that about God? Ere you profane the temple this dagger shall slay your daughter! I must dissemble and my wrath will burst forth all the stronger. Let the madmen tremble at my anger! Victims all, they now shall fall! Amid tears and groans wicked Zion must welter in a sea of blood! Father, have mercy! The vehemence of my anger is calmed... I am at the point of death now because of you! O almighty God, send us thy aid! ...by the new hope shining before my eyes. That girl who disputes my one and only love with me will perhaps fall victim to revenge! Send us thy aid! Father, let pity speak in your heart! I am at the point of death now because of you! Vengeance! Pardon the victims of misfortune and your daughterwill be saved! Amid tears and groans, wicked Zion must welter in a sea of blood! Down on your knees, O defeated slaves! I am the conqueror. I challenged him in battle, but did your God come? He is afraid of me. Who in the whole wide world, you fools, will be able to withstand me? Wicked monster, see! The first victim I slay shall be this girl. Do you thirst for blood? Let it spill from your daughter's breast! - Stop! - No, she shall die! Unhappy girl! Love shall save you! My fury, no longer constrained, will massacre the conquered horribly. Plunder and burn the temple; mercy will be a crime! Unhappy man, fond affection has drawn a veil before his eyes! Plunder and burn the temple; mercy will be a crime! Oh, let not this unhappy man be accursed, for pity's sake! Be rejected of men, traitor to your brethren! Your name shall be cursed throughout the ages! "Oh, flee from this cursed man", heaven and earth cry out! Happy chance that I found you, O fatal document! In his bosom the king tried to hide you in order to prove my shame! Abigaille, issue of slaves! Very well! Let it be so! Daughter of Nabucco, such as the Assyrians take me to be, what am I here? Worse than a slave! The throne the king entrusts to the younger Fenena while he, among his soldiers, bends his mind to exterminate Judaea! Me he sends from the battlefield here to observe the loves of others! Oh, wretches all and even more deluded! Little do you know the heart of Abigaille! Upon everyone you will see my fury fall! Ah, yes! Let Fenena fall, my pretended father, the whole realm! Upon me hurl thyself, O fatal anger! I, too, once opened my heartto happiness. Everything around me I heard speak of holy love. I wept at others' tears, suffered at others' pain. Ah, to that lost enchantment who will one day return me? Who comes here? My eyes have witnessed a terrible sight! Oh! Of what do you speak? Fenena is a wicked woman: she is setting the Hebrews free! Who now can check this accursed rabble? Power awaits you. How is that? All is prepared. We have already spread the rumour abroad that the king has fallen in battle. The people call for you as queen to save the Assyrian land. Only a step... fortune is yours! I am with you! Go! Oh, faithful subject! This woman shall not be less than you in courage! I now ascend the bloodstained seat of the golden throne. From that seat I shall be able to take my revenge. That the sceptre is mine by right all peoples shall see! Royal princesses will come hither to beg favours of the humble slave. And the vengeance of Baal will thunder alongside yours. Come, O Levite! Give me the book of the law! The Lord wishes me to be the agent of a new miracle! He sends me as his servant for the glory of Israel to tear apart the darkness of an unbeliever. On the lips of the prophets thou hast fulminated, O almighty God! To Assyria in mighty accents now speak thou with my lips! And with psalms sacred to thee every temple shall resound. Above the shattered idols thy law shall stand. What can be wanted? Who summoned us to this place so late at night? - The pontiff summons you. - Ismaele! - Brethren! - Horror! Away! Begone! - I implore your mercy! -Accursed of the Lord! He who is accursed has no brethren; no man on earth vouchsafes him a word! Harsh lamentation everywhere arises; the wind bears it to the wretch's ears! On his brow, bright as the lightning, shines God's fatal brand! Poison is prepared for his lips in vain; vainly the dagger would pierce his heart! For love of the living God have done with your curses! Fury is driving me mad! Oh, death, for pity's sake! Oh, brethren, forgive! He saved a Hebrew maid! Oh, what are you saying! Raise psalms of thanksgiving to God everlasting! It is true! But what a tumult is mounting! Oh, heaven! What can it be? Royal lady, fly! That cry of ill omen announces the death of the king! Oh, father! Fly! The people now call for Abigaille and condemn these men here. Why do I tarry longer? I must not stay here! To the midst of the impious rebels I will hasten! Stay! Oh, what a misfortune! Glory be to Abigaille! Death to the Hebrews! Give me the crown! I shall die first! From my head take it! The moment of direst wrath is fast approaching. Upon their silent faces terror already falls! The thunderbolts all about are poised ready to fall! A day of mourning and vexation is dawning! The moment of direstwrath is fast approaching. Upon their silent faces terror already falls! The thunderbolts all about are poised ready to fall! A day of mourning and vexation is dawning! Hear me now! Babylonians, I throw your god to the ground! He has rendered you traitors; he wished to take you from my power. Your god has fallen, O foolish Hebrews, fighting against me. Hark my words, there is only one god: your king! - Heavens! - What do I hear? -Alas, foolish man! Long live Nabucco! Now bow down your faces to the ground! Worship me, your God! Madman! May your insane pride be brought low. God will seize you by the hair; already he robs you of your throne! Do you dare so much? O loyal followers, let this old man be conducted to the foot of the idol. He shall perish with his people. A Hebrew, I shall die with them. You lie! O wretched girl, prostrate yourself before my image! I have embraced the Hebrew faith! Down! Prostrate yourself! I am king no more; I am God! See how avenging heaven has struck the presumptuous man! Who is it that takes my royal sceptre from me? What horrid spectre is pursuing me? Who seizes me, alack, by the hair? Who is crushing me? Who lays me low? O my daughter! Will not even you help to support me in my weakness? Alas, I am surrounded by phantoms; they have flaming swords of fire! And the blood-red sky has fallen upon my head! Why did a tear start from my eye? Who will support me? I am fainting! Heaven has punished the boaster! But the greatness of the people of Baal shall not be eclipsed! Assyria is a queen as powerful as Baal upon earth. She deals destruction everywhere if the stranger challenges her to war. Now among the joys of peace, worthy reward of valour, she will pass her smiling days in happiness and love. Peerless lady, ruler of Assyria's fate, hear the prayers of your faithful subjects! The wicked children of Judah must all be destroyed and, first and foremost, that woman whom I dare not call your sister. She has betrayed Baal. What are you asking of me? But who comes here? What presumptuous fellow is it that breaks my royal interdiction? Conduct the old man back to his apartments! Who dares raise his voice in the presence of Nabucco? Deign to follow me, my lord! Where would you lead me? Let me be! This is the council chamber. Stay. Do you not see? They are awaiting me. Why do you support me? I am weak, it is true, but woe if anyone should know it! I wish everyone to think me still strong. Let go of me. I shall find my seat myself. Who is this woman? Oh, what effrontery! Withdraw, loyal subjects! Woman, who are you? Custodian of your throne I came hither! You? Of my throne? Oh, imposture! Were you commanded to do so by me? You lay sick. The people cried out against the rebellious Hebrew. You must set your royal seal to their decree! Death is writ here for the wicked rebels. - What are you saying? - Sign! A thought troubles me! You refuse? Arise then, happy Hebrews! Raise hymns of glory to your God! What is that I hear! Seized with cowardly dismay Nabucco is no longer himself! You lie! Let death be dealt to the whole of Israel! - Give me the parchment! - Oh, what good fortune is mine! Oh, what good fortune is mine! The last obstacle is surmounted! - Oh! But what of Fenena? - Traitress! She has given herself to the false god. - Oh, she shall die! - She is my flesh and blood! No one can save her! - Horror! - Another daughter... Bow low, slave, before your lord! Fool! Here I wished to await you! Me, a slave? Learn the truth. Thus do I return, miserable creature, the lying document to you! Oh, what deep shame afflicts my grey hairs! In vain my failing hand flies to my once feared sword! Oh, wretched old man! You are but the shadow of the king! Oh, day of long-coveted glory, thou art come! The throne is worth far more than a lost father! At last the people will fall at the base slave's feet. Oh, what sound is that? It is the death knell of the Hebrews you have condemned! Ho there, guards! I am betrayed! O fool! Do you still oppose me? These guards I have kept in reserve solely for you, prisoner! - Prisoner? - Yes! Of a slave who scorns your might! - Prisoner? - Yes! Oh, pardon a fatherwho is mad! Oh, give me back my daughter. Do not bereave a father! Then let the people of Assyria call you lady and queen. This old man asks nothing of you but the life of his heart's delight! Be off! You beg grace of me in vain. I am unmoved by your belated tears. Such you were not, presumptuous old man, when you reserved dishonour for me. It will be seen now if the royal mantle ill becomes this slave! Oh, pardon! It will be seen now if I besmirch the grandeur of Assyria! Fly, thought, on wings of gold. Go settle upon the slopes and the hills where, soft and mild, fragrant smell the sweet airs ofour native land! Greet the banks of the Jordan and Zion's toppled towers. Oh, my country so lovely and lost! Oh, remembrance so dear and so fraught with despair! Golden harp of the prophetic seers, why dost thou hang mute upon the willow? Rekindle our bosom's memories and speak of times gone by! Mindful of the fate of Jerusalem either give forth an air of sad lamentation or else let the Lord imbue us with fortitude to bear our sufferings! Oh, who is it that weeps? Who is it that raises lamentations, as of timorous women, to the Everlasting? Oh, rise up, brothers in anguish! The Lord speaks from my lips! In the obscurity of the future I see. Behold, the shameful chains are broken! The wrath of the lion of Judah already falls upon the treacherous sand! Oh, happy future! To settle upon the skulls, upon the bones, hither come the hyenas and the snakes. Midst the dust raised by the wind a doomed silence shall reign! The owl alone will spread abroad its sad lament when evening falls. No stone shall stand to tell the stranger where once proud Babylon stood! Oh, what a fire burns in the old man! The Lord speaks through his lips! Yes, the shameful fetters shall be broken! The courage of Judah is rousing already! These are my limbs! Through the woods was I not fleeing, panting like a hunted beast? Oh, it was a dream, a terrible dream! Now, behold the cry of war! My sword, ho! My charger, which thirsts for battle as a young girl longs for dancing! Oh, my valiant troops! Zion, that proud city, see, towering here. She must be ours. Let her fall in ashes! Fenena! From the lips of my faithful subjects does my daughter's name fall! See! She comes running between ranks of soldiers! Alas! Am I dreaming? Why are her hands bound in chains? She is weeping! To death with Fenena! Oh, I am a prisoner! God of the Hebrews, forgive me! Judah's God! The altar, the temple sacred to thee shall rise again. Oh, rescue me from this terrible anguish! Oh, rescue me from this terrible anguish, and I shall destroy my rites. Thou hearest me! The wicked wretch's sick and sinful mind is clearing already! True and omnipotent God, I shall worship thee henceforth always. Open now, fatal door! - My lord, where are you hastening? - Let me be! You wish to go forth so that your sick mind may be affronted? Oh, we have come here to defend you! What are you saying? My mind is no longer deranged. Abdallo, my sword. To regain the throne here it is, O king! I would save Fenena. The traitors shall fall like locusts to the ground! Through you we shall see the sun shine upon Assyria once again! Follow me, O my valiant men. Day opens to my mind. I burn with unaccustomed ardour. I am king of Assyria once more! At the flashing of this blade the wicked shall fall to the ground! We shall see everything resplendent again in the sunlight of my crown. Through you we shall see it shine bright... ...in the sunlight of my crown. Go, win the palm of martyrdom. Go and win it, O pure young maid. You have been too long in exile. Your country is in heaven! Hasten! Oh, the firmament is opened up! My soul longs for the Lord. He smiles upon me and reveals to me hundred upon hundred of joys everlasting! Oh, splendour of the stars, farewell! God floods me with his holy light! From this mortal body that, heavy as lead, detains us here my soul escapes already and wings its way to heaven! Long live Nabucco! What cry is that? Long live Nabucco! Let the rite be consummated! Stop, you fools! Soldiers, shatter the baneful idol like dust to the ground! Divine miracle! Oh, return once more, Israel, to the delights of thy native land! Let a new temple be raised to thy God. He alone is great! Mighty is he alone! To the wicked tyrant he brought madness, into the repentant king's breast he brought peace. The mind of Abigaille he disturbed so the wretch drank poison. He alone is great! Mighty is he alone! Daughter, let us worship him, bowed low to the ground. Great Jehovah, who has not felt thy might? Who is not as dust in thy sight? Almighty Jehovah, who has not felt thy might? Who is not as dust in thy sight? Doth thy rainbow span the firmament? All things are radiant. Dost thou unleash the thunderbolt? Man is as naught. Great Jehovah, who has not felt thy might? Who is not as dust in thy sight? Oh, whom do I see? Why does the wretched girl now drag herself hither? To me, faint, dying, let your pardon be vouchsafed! Fenena! I was to blame. I am punished for it now! Come! These two loved each other. May they place their hopes in you! Who will now relieve me of the iron burden of my crime? You have said, O people: "God lifts up..." "God lifts up the afflicted." I implore thee, O God, thee I do revere. Let me not be damned! Dead! Servant of Jehovah, you shall be king of kings!
