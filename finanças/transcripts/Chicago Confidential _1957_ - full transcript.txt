[narrator] Chicago, Illinois, one of the giants of industry among the cities of the world. The heart of all shipping on the Great Lakes. A colossus of big business and finance. A city of gaiety, with a legion of fine restaurants, theaters and night clubs. Millions of workers, a high percentage of them members of various unions and guilds. Most of these unions are decent and honest, working in behalf of their members. Some are not. Hello, State's Attorney's office? My name is Partos, Mickey Partos. No, Mr. Fremont wouldn't know me. Just tell him this is important, very important. Mr. Fremont? Mickey Partos. I'm the treasurer of the Workers National Brotherhood. Mr. Fremont, I have to see you. I have evidence that proves racketeers are trying to take over our union. Yes. Yes, it's in a set of books I kept. No, I can't come to your office. How about your house? Tonight? Yeah. Yeah, I'll bring the books, everything. But you gotta keep my name out of it. Yeah, this is confidential. Understand? Confidential. Okay, tonight. [narrator] On the night of May 6th, the treasurer of the Workers National Brotherhood, a man named Mickey Partos, was bound for an important meeting at the home of James Fremont, State's Attorney for Cook County, Illinois. [Mickey grunting] [honking] [tires screeching] All right, now plant the gun. [narrator] The murdered man, Mickey Partos, was supposed to meet that same night with the president of the Workers National Brotherhood, Arthur Blane. We should have heard from Mickey by now, Laura. Maybe he called here while we were on our way back from my apartment. Maybe. Those books are dynamite. I shouldn't have let Mickey handle it. I should've done it myself. Artie, Artie, you couldn't. Harrison had you watched like a hawk. He's had this office wired, your house covered. He knows every move you make. Mickey and I have been together a long time. I know. We came up through the ranks together. It's been a long time. Laura, I could have fought harder in that election. I might have turned enough votes away from Harrison so that he'd never been vice president. You couldn't know that he'd sell out the way he did. Honey, it's my business to know what goes on here. Artie, look, will you stop blaming yourself? Art, when this is over we're gonna get married and take that trip to Europe. Well? [door opening] What do you want here, Harrison? We'd better have a talk. I'll be at my apartment. Call me. Sure. Good night, Laura. What do you want? You made a mistake. You shouldn't have sent Mickey to the State's Attorney. Do you know that? You had your chance, Artie. We wanted to include you. Now it's too late. Include me in what? In robbing my own unions? Stealing over a half a million dollars from the welfare fund? There's no proof of that. Isn't there? Mickey kept another set of books, books that you never saw. We saw them. All right, there's other evidence. Evidence of how you and your thugs forced manufacturers to permit betting books and numbers to operate right in their own plants. Signed statements of how you were setting up a vice operation, importing B girls and making them work in every saloon in this town. There's no proof of anything. Anything, understand? And if you're counting on the State's Attorney, don't. Where's Mickey Partos? There you are, Artie, $50,000. It's all yours. Take it. And start running. Running? You're not going to be around here for the union election in June. I'm going to run the WNB, not you! And you think you can get rid of me with this? You have your choice. Take it and get out of the country in the next seven hours or stay here and take whatever happens. Get out, Harrison. Get out. You can still make it, Artie. Seven hours. You won't have any longer than that. Remember, you had your chance. Where's Mickey? What've you done with him? Mickey? Mickey never got to Fremont. Mickey's dead. It's a shame. Somebody caught up with him, I guess. Somebody who didn't like him. It doesn't pay to make the wrong kind of enemies. [door closing] [narrator] Meanwhile, on the dock where Mickey Partos was killed, the accidental presence of an old derelict known as Candymouth Duggan, was destined to have a decided effect on the infiltration of gangsterism into Chicago's labor union structure. Early the next morning, the murder was discovered. But the unidentified body recovered from the submerged car gave no immediate indication of the importance of the case. What about the gun? Smith and Wesson, huh? Did you check the registration? Okay, Mac, get on it and get back to me, [man] Oh, Captain, Ballistics says the bullet was fired from a .22 Smith and Wesson long rifle. -What've you got? -Well... This is the left thumb from a guy by the name of Mickey Partos, this is the left thumb print from the body. -Now see these three contra forks? -Yeah. One above the other? Yeah. Both the same. Yeah. The dead guy is Partos, all right. Any record? Oh, just normal classification. A union executive treasurer. -Union? -WNB. Notify the State's Attorney's office. That's where I'll be if you want anything else. Okay. Hi, Jake. Jim. Call me back, will you? From that mob of newspaper guys outside, it looks like you're on to a hot one. Hotter than I want. How do you figure it? You know how the rackets are operating on the unions in other cities. -Yeah. -Blackmail, prostitution, dope, gambling. -They don't miss any bets. -That's right. That's why Mickey Partos was coming to see me last night. See you? He told me the mob was taking over his union. He was bringing me evidence to prove it. What kind of ax was Partos grinding? I don't know, but he was after somebody. Artie Blane? The head man. Maybe. It can't just be local guys pulling this off. We ran the syndicate mugs out of Chicago long ago. And it looks like they're coming back through the unions, doesn't it? And all we got is a stiff in the morgue and the fact that the murder weapon was a Smith and Wesson. Yeah. Without Partos's evidence, I'm a dead duck. Oh, I'll make an investigation of Blane and the rest of the union top brass. It'll be a lot of questions and phony answers. Right. The only wedge we've got, Jake, is to find the guy who killed Mickey Partos. So get a hold of that gun, will you? We'll bear down. And, Jake, listen. Yeah. I don't have to tell you how important this is, do I? Sure. We could wake up tomorrow and find that the United States doesn't own Chicago anymore. [narrator] That same morning, in the home of Alan Dixon, a disbarred lawyer and once one of the masterminds of the old Capone gang, another meeting took place, concerning the gun that killed Mickey Partos. The gun should have been put in the car with Partos, not on the dock. We'll locate it, Mr. Dixon. I want the police to locate it. That's why we planted it. The word's out in all the joints we control. It'll turn up and we'll make sure that the police get it. We have nothing until the Partos killing is hung on Blane. Just remember that. Well, we could have saved ourselves a lot of trouble by getting rid of Blane instead of Partos. Killing Blane wouldn't have killed the votes of the men who back him. If Blane goes to jail for murder, that means all his loyal supporters will go down with him. None of them will stand a chance of being elected to office. That's how you'll get to be elected WNB president. Yeah. Well, you're running the show. Keep that in mind. That's the way the syndicate wants it. We've only started to build our organization in this town. The day Blane is convicted, we'll go into high gear. Find that gun. I don't want to hear from you till you do. [Betty] Hey, honey, how about a bite of that? [woman] Are you kidding? You got a nerve. Milt? No. Milt? Beat it, you stink up the joint. How many times have I told you? You want a handout, go to the back door. Please, Milt. Just one, a short one. Milt, Milt. Straight, Milt. Skip the ice. And I'll pay you tomorrow. Oh, sure. Only tomorrow never gets here. Milt, please! Listen, you still owe a week's rent for that dump you live in upstairs. You're supposed to be working here. This ain't no charity home. Milt, you can trust me. You're not supposed to drink. You're just supposed to make the customers thirsty. Please, Milt. All right. But this is the last one. -Thanks. -Hm. You still here? Oh, so now you're gonna knock over the place? I found it, Milt. The other night, on the dock. Understand? The other night. Yeah, I think you latched on to something, Candymouth. It must be worth a lot to somebody, huh, Milt? Maybe somebody like Artie Blane. Maybe I could get it to him, huh? Maybe I could get back in the union. What did you say, Milt? Will you help me? Yeah, I'll help you. Help yourself. Come on, drink up. Let me talk to Harrison. Yeah, it's important, very important. Tell him it's Milt. Mr. Harrison? I think I got something you're looking for. [piano music playing] Thanks. Here's to you, mate. Let's see it. How'd it get here? A rummy found it on the pier. Who is he? He used to be a member of the WNB years ago. They threw him out for hitting the bottle. What'd he see? I don't know. But he's in the back. [coughs] Come in. Have a drink, huh? Milt says you found this on the pier the other night, after Partos was killed? That's right. What else did you see? Nothing. [coughs] All I seen was the gun. That's all. Nothing else. You didn't see a car? I told you. That's all I seen. There's nothing else. Yeah, you told me. On your feet. On your feet. Once more. I'll never remember it, I tell ya... I have trouble remembering things. We'll try once more. You know what will happen to you if you don't go through with this. [stammering] I was out taking a walk, getting some air when this car drives out on the pier. Right? That's right. Artie Blane was driving it. [stuttering] Don't tell me. Then... Oh, yeah. [stammering] He got out and he started looking around for something, see? He was looking for that gun. See, I remembered it. I did just what you said, didn't I? Finish it. Uh... Blane didn't find the gun, and after he left I wondered what he was looking for. So I did some looking around myself and that's how come I found it. It's beginning to penetrate. When Fremont questions you about your drinking, what will you tell him? I ain't had a drink in weeks. Right? Work with him. All night, if you have to. And get him a bath and some clothes. And then the final step. In the morning, make sure the police locate Blane's car. Jim, we've got something. The car that pushed Partos off the dock. Bumper marks, scratches, paint, they all match. The car's in the name of Artie Blane. You mean Blane did it himself? Why not? Maybe he couldn't trust anybody else. He's your pigeon, Jim. Yeah. Yeah, maybe that's what Partos wanted to tell me. The car was reported stolen a week ago. But Blane could have had that set up. [intercom buzzing] Yeah? [Evans] Something here on the Partos case that might interest you, Mr. Fremont. Come in, Evans. Mr. Fremont. Hi. Mr. Duggan here saw Blane on the pier the other night. He also found this. It's registered to Blane. It's the murder weapon. Ballistics report, Mr. Duggan's statement. Thank you. Sit down, will you, Mr. Duggan. Thanks. Black and white. Let Blane try to wiggle out of this one. Mr. Duggan, it says here that you recognized Blane. That's right. How did you know him? I used to belong to the WNB. I've seen Artie Blane lots of times. You hang around the docks a lot? Well, I got friends there. They give me jobs now and then. What're you questioning me for? I come here to help you. Well, it's just formality, Mr. Duggan. No reason for you to be frightened. [chuckles] Who's frightened? Sure. How long's it been since you had a drink? Liquor? Yeah. Oh, weeks. I ain't had a drink for weeks. Well? I think Mr. Duggan is going to be able to help us. Pick up Blane, will you, Jake? [officer] Relax your hand. Look, Fremont, I'm not going to give you any song and dance, that's what you get from everybody you arrest. I'm leveling with you. I'm being framed and you're falling for it. It was your gun and your car and you were seen by a witness. Do you think I'd kill Mickey? I'm the guy that was sending him to you with that evidence. Blane, if you got any defense, you can use it in court. -You won't listen? -Nope. Okay. I'll be able to sleep nights. Hey. Well, good evening. Hi. What are you doing up? I thought you'd be asleep by now. All good wives wait up for their husbands. Oh, yeah. Been working on the case? Nope. Now, if you intend for that to sound mysterious, it does. I was thinking maybe we ought to move out of this place. I think it's getting a little stuffy. A little stuffy? Yeah, compared to the governor's mansion. Jim, you're not serious. Those political boys who came to see me tonight were serious. Biggest wheels in the state, sweetie. They tell me the nomination's a cinch! But why now, all of a sudden? The trial. According to them, if I convict Blane, I'm as good as elected. Oh, honey, this is wonderful. Wonderful. It's all we ever worked for. Well, the hard work is just beginning. It's not work stamping on a mess like the corruption in the WNB. or putting guys like Artie Blane where they belong. Boy, will that get you the union vote. I mean it. That's not supposed to be a campaign speech. It's not bad though, is it? Terrific! Honest James Fremont, the people's choice. Shall we drink on it? Make it long, tall and cool. [narrator] By the morning of the third day, the evidence that had piled up against Blane seemed to give State's Attorney, Fremont, an airtight case. That afternoon, Blane's attorney produced two surprise witnesses in Blane's defense. The first of these was Laura Barton. Now you say Mr. Blane came to your apartment to discuss plans for your marriage next month. What time did he arrive there? Right after a business call he made, 9:00. [Morgan] Just how do you fix the time so accurately? Mr. Blane had just gotten in when the 9:00 news came on television. Did either of you see or talk to any other person? Yes, I made a late dinner, but I'd forgotten to buy cigarettes. So, Artie... I mean Mr. Blane, called to Sylvia Clarkson. And who is Miss Clarkson? She has the apartment next to mine. It's around the corner of the light well. I can... I can call to her from my window. [Morgan] And what did Mr. Blane say? Well, as near as I can remember, he said, "If you can spare them, Sylvia, "bring over a couple of packs." And what did Sylvia say? She said, "Sure thing, Mr. Blane," or something like that. Then she brought them to the door and I took them. Now, Miss Barton, you have stated that Mr. Blane came to your apartment at 9:00. What time did he leave? 11:00. 11:00. And now let me ask you again, and let me remind you that you are under oath. During those two hours, did Mr. Blane leave the apartment at any time? He did not. Thank you. [narrator] The second of the surprise witnesses was Sylvia Clarkson, a nightclub singer, who substantiated for the defense what Laura Barton had testified. Her testimony severely damaged the case presented by James Fremont. One of the sensations of the trial was the move by Emery Morgan, counsel for the defense, in presenting two new witnesses, Laura Barton and Sylvia Clarkson. When Miss Barton took the stand, she was asked... [turns off tv] Jim, Sylvia Clarkson. Could her testimony have been bought? I don't know about her. Money could be that important to her. I don't feel that way about Laura Barton. She's very much in love with Blane. Wouldn't that be incentive enough for her to perjure herself? You would feel that way about it, wouldn't you? [phone ringing] Hello? Yeah, Jake. A tape recorder. Where'd you find it? Yeah. Look, meet me at the office. Yeah, yeah. I'll leave right now. Thanks, Jake. You heard that, didn't you? Are you really going down to the office? Got to, honey. Can't it wait till morning? Jake's turned up some new evidence. It's gonna make a liar out of Laura Barton. Don't wait up. [narrator] The prosecution quickly established that the tape recorder belonged to Laura Barton and had been given to her by Blane 10 days before the murder of Mickey Partos. I'll ask you to listen to this voice and tell me if you recognize it. [tape clicks on] [Blane] Hate to bother you, Syl, but we ran out of cigarettes. If you can spare them, lend us a couple of packs. Do you recognize the voice, Miss Barton? I don't know. Miss Barton, isn't it true that Arthur Blane made that recording prior to the night of the murder? No. And you used it to deceive Miss Clarkson and establish an alibi for Blane when he went out to kill Mickey Partos? That's not true! He did leave your apartment before 11:00 that night, didn't he? No, he didn't. Then you played that recording to make the girl next door think he was still there. That's a lie. But he'd already gone out, hadn't he? He didn't come back for an hour. That's what happened that night, Miss Barton, isn't it? No, it isn't! He was there. He was there all the time. [narrator] The tape recorder completely discounted the testimony of Laura Barton. There remained but one more witness who had to be eliminated, Sylvia Clarkson. [muffled screams] No marks. [gasping] We've been reading about you. You done real good in court. [gasping] Only you done real good for the wrong side. [whimpering] Okay, that's a sample of what it's like. Now, tomorrow, you're going back to answer questions for Fremont. You're gonna remember it different. You never saw Blane that night. You're gonna say you made a mistake when you said you saw Blane in Laura Barton's apartment. Right? [crowd gasping] You be a good girl, we don't bother you no more. [sobbing] [narrator] The complete shattering of the Blane defense came when Sylvia Clarkson admitted that it might have been Blane's recorded voice she heard, and that she probably only thought she'd seen Blane in Laura Barton's apartment that night. [chattering] [chattering stops] Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. The defendant will rise and face the bar. What is your verdict? We, the Jury, find the defendant, Arthur Blane, guilty of murder in the first degree, as charged. Court stands adjourned. [reporters clamoring] [Dixon] The last obstacle's been removed. Everybody's happy. Everybody except Blane, of course. We get complete control of WNB. Fremont gets to be governor, the union gets a complete whitewashing. And even the ones who are forced to go along with our little enterprise stand to make more money. The airline charters all arranged? Just completed the last one today. From Miami to Havana. Good. Then we're ready to start servicing our foreign customers. I'm going to give you a file of all our accounts in foreign countries. They'll pay high prices for American girls. You select the girls. Arrange all the necessary papers. Right. It's a clear road from here, Harrison. Clear and well-paved. We can start to spread out now. Send out orders. All the way down the line. Get started. I'll got on it first thing tomorrow. Today. Okay. [narrator] With the conviction of Arthur Blane, the racketeer element in the WNB began to widen its activities. All manufacturers dealing with the union were terrorized into allowing bookie and numbers rackets to operate in their factories. Bars were forced to put B girls to work, making the proprietors part of the vice racket whether they wanted it or not. And the girls, as well as the proprietors, had to pay off weekly to union collectors. Every worker in the entire membership received quiet threats. "Contribute to the Ken Harrison union election fund "or suffer the consequences." All this was accomplished with the efficiency of men who knew how to use terror as a threat. And the more terror existed, the less the police had to go on. There wasn't one bit of evidence or testimony that could trace the violence to the Workers National Brotherhood. [Jake] "And Fremont has done a monumental job "in striking at the very heart of racketeering in unions, "the so-called executives who run them." You listening? I read it twice. You know, you'll be the youngest governor this state ever had. Jake, I want to get elected. I wouldn't kid you about that. I'm not kidding myself, either. I've done a lot of soul-searching on myself about this. And it's not just ambition. I really believe that my ideas can help the state. [intercom buzzing] You know, I told you. Yeah? [Evans] A Miss Barton's here, sir. Send her in. Laura Barton? Yeah. She's called up every day since the trial ended. Brother, they never give up. Want me to leave? No, stick around. She's probably going to start calling me names. Maybe you can pick up some new ones. Come in, Miss Barton. You know Captain Parker? Sit down, please. Thank you. Now what can I do for you? Mr. Fremont, you made a mistake about Artie Blane. Well, that makes 13 of us, doesn't it? There were 12 people on the jury. Artie was with me that night. He couldn't have killed Mickey Partos. We've been all through that. Mr. Fremont, listen to me. You listen to me, Miss Barton. Every time a man is convicted, a lot of friends and relatives show up here. They scream that the guilty man's been railroaded or framed or beaten up by the police to get a confession. But they never have a shred of evidence to back up that accusation. Now, if you can show me some new evidence, Miss Barton, I'll listen to you. Mr. Fremont, that wasn't a trial. The public convicted Artie before that trial began. You and the public and the newspapers. You just crucified him. You and your investigation of the unions. Look, if you're really interested in getting the thieves in the unions, then why don't you get the right men? What do you want to do? Find out the truth after he's been executed? You through? No, I'm not. That wasn't Artie Blane's voice you heard on that tape recorder. It had to be somebody else's. I know because Artie Blane was with me. Even... Even your own witness established the time Mickey Partos was killed. And at that time Artie Blane was with me! Miss Blane, I'm a public servant, and I'm paid to see that justice is done. I wish I could convince you of that. Well, you're not going to convince me of it until Artie goes free. All right, I'll see what I can do to convince you. Jake, get a man from Polygraph with a tape recorder, will you? What are you going to do? I'll try to prove to you that was Blane's voice you heard on the recording. -Evans. -Yes, sir. Get the head man at Ryder Sound Research, please. Yes, sir. This is a busy office, Miss Barton. You're wasting time with this demand. I don't mind having a killer like Artie Blane on my conscience, but I don't want you on my conscience. Are you afraid of the truth, Mr. Fremont? I'll be waiting to hear from you. [door closing] Brother, they just never give up. Plug it in. You mind telling me what this is all about? Laura Barton seems to think that you got short changed. We want to see that you get your money's worth. You mean she found some new evidence? Why don't you level with yourself, Blane? What could she possibly find? Then what are you doing here? Just come to dig my grave a little deeper? [Martin] All set, Mr. Fremont. Give me the mike. What is this? Speak clearly into the mike and say this, please. What for?Just say them. "I hate to bother you, Syl, "but we ran out of cigarettes..." Start again. "Hate to bother you, Syl, "but we ran out of cigarettes. "If you can spare them, lend us a couple of packs." Okay, Martin? We'd better make another one to be sure. A little louder this time. "Hate to bother you, Syl, "but we ran out of cigarettes. "If you can spare them, lend us a couple of packs." Okay. All right, I did what you wanted, now what was it for? Laura Barton wants proof that you're innocent. So we're gonna let the sound laboratory prove that you're not. We're all ready, Jim. Just waiting for you to get here. Dr. Charing's going to run the test for us himself. -Doctor. -Hello, Mr. Fremont. -How are you today? -Fine, thanks. Now, look, we can't leave any room for doubt on this, Doctor. Is this a conclusive test? -The results will be positive, Mr. Fremont. -Hm. These oscilloscopes reproduce the entire range of the human voice. And they measure the base response, medium range and high ends. What are high ends, sir? You'd call them high frequencies. The machines accurately analyze any sound. Two sounds may appear absolutely identical to the human ear, but the machines can separate the component parts that go to make up the sounds. Understand? Yeah. I think so. Oh, sit down, please. -Thank you. -Captain? Oh, no, thanks. I'll just stand here. Now, the alpha sounds. The recording you brought into court will appear on this screen. The beta sounds, the recording you made of Blane's voice in jail, will appear on this screen. Start the first recorder, please. You are now watching a graph of the voice introduced as testimony at the trial. The beta recording, please. Now you are watching a graph of the voice of Mr. Blane, the one you made in his cell. They look the same to me. I sure couldn't tell the difference. Watch, gentlemen, I will now reproduce both recordings. You are now watching images of the whole speeches from both recordings. There are differences in the speech components, like with your fingerprints, Captain. Let me show you. I've taken a sample word from each of the two recordings. The single word "cigarettes." Now, let me show you both those images. Martin. This is the voice you brought into the court room. This is the voice you recorded in jail. As you can see, gentlemen, the two images are not the same. The imitation of Blane's voice was an excellent one to the human ear. But the high frequency sibilance is much less pronounced in this beta recording. This indicates a decided difference in mouth cavity and teeth separation. The two recordings couldn't possibly have been made by the same man. You're sure, aren't you, Doctor? The equipment can't possibly lie. Artie Blane could be innocent. Yeah. Brother, what a mess. Now what do we do, Jim? We start all over again, Jake. Review all the evidence and testimony. First, we have to find the guy that made this recording. You better turn the town inside out. Hit the nightclubs, theaters, booking agents. I want a rundown on every performer that does imitations. And pick up that little tramp, Candymouth. Okay. Oh, Jim. The newspapers will think this is a phony. They'll claim there was a pay off. Yeah, I know. Laura Barton said I was gonna be afraid of the truth. Get going, will you, Jake? Well, Doctor, Artie Blane's got a lot to thank you for. So have I. We've got trouble. That girl we planted in the police file room, she's come up with one. Get to the point. The cops are looking for Candymouth Duggan. Fremont wants to question him again. Why? I've tried to find out. Everybody's clammed up. Don't wait to find out. Get to Duggan, get to him first. I'll expect to read the results in the morning papers. All right. Milt! [jazz music playing] [knocking at door] Milt! Milt! Well, well, my best customer. Oh, well, sure, why not? Come on in, buddy. -Here we are. -Oh. A whole bottle? Are you kidding, Milt? A whole bottle? What happened to you? Something good, huh? Oh, a girl, huh? [stutters] Do me a favor, will you, Milt? My hands are a little shaky. Pour the first one, huh? Sure, pal. Maybe I ought to feed it to you, too. I know, I gotta start tapering off. [bottle shatters] I'm sorry, Milt. Come here. You don't have to worry about it. You just sit there and take it nice and easy. There you are. Thanks, Milt. Okay, pal. Just get happy. Thanks. Let me talk to Harrison. Yeah, it's Milt. Hello, Harrison? He's here. Yeah, he's in the back room. Don't worry, I'll keep him there. Listen. Please... ...just not around here. [train whistle blowing] Did you check it all the way through, Jake? But good. Nothing. Not a thing to tell us whether Duggan wandered onto the tracks, or fell off the viaduct. Or got himself pushed off. Could have been anything. The medical examiner said he had a skinful of whiskey. Well, that figures, too. [intercom buzzing] Yeah. [Evans] Lieutenant Traynor's here to see you. What's it about? Oh, he's working on the imitators. Send him right in. Come in, Lieutenant. Mr. Fremont, Captain. What've you got? Well, I don't know whether it's much. A fellow named Kerry Jordan. He works at a place called The Green Dragon cafe. He made a bank deposit of $500, June 28th. The last week of the trial. We've been able to check back a few years. It's the biggest deposit he ever made. Any record? Well, reform school twice, assault and battery in Detroit. Slugged a cafe manager. The charges were withdrawn. The manager needed him in the show. Jordan's supposed to be pretty good. That answer anything for you? Just the date of the deposit. You know, Duggan might've been killed because of a leak someplace. Can you pick up the Clarkson girl without putting a report through the department? Yeah. Okay, we'll screen everybody on the force, right down to the janitors. Handle that, Traynor, and handle it right. Kerry Jordan. Now what? Now we'll find out if Blane knows anything about this guy. [Jim] This guy does imitations, his name is Jordan. Jordan. Jordan. The name doesn't do a thing. Well, try to think back. This couldn't have been too long ago. Because it must be somebody you talked to. He'd had to hear your voice to do the imitation. Oh, I've met and talked to a lot of entertainers. Just because a guy does imitations, there's no reason why it should stick in my mind. Maybe if you could bring this Jordan in here I'd recognize his face. What do you think, Jake? No. It'd be a sure tip off, Blane. They'd run so far for cover, we'd never catch up with them. He's right. Laura. Laura and I went everywhere together. Maybe she'd recognize this Jordan. Yeah. Guard! Jake, get a hold of Laura Barton. Have her meet me at that Green Dragon place tonight, 8:15. We can give it a try. [chattering] As Al Jolson used to say, [chuckles] "Wait a minute, folks. I said, wait a minute, "you ain't heard nothing yet." Now, who else would you like to hear? Do Robinson. Edward G. Robinson. [Jordan] Edward G, Robinson? Okay. [piano playing] [audience laughing] All right, you guys, outside. Remember, I'm top man around here and what I say goes. Yeah. No? [audience laughing] Yeah. Yeah. -Table please. -This way, please.

[sighs] Well, now we invite you to dance, folks, and I'll see you later. When I return... I'll be back. Everybody dance. [audience applauding] Scotch and soda? Two scotch and sodas, please. They must be wise or something. Look, for the 500 bucks you paid me I don't want to get in trouble with the cops. I'm gonna clear out of here. Don't be a fool, Jordan. You run now, they'll be sure that you're the one they want. Stay there, go out and do another show. All right. No, I won't talk to them. Okay, I'll wait here. But you better think up something good if there's trouble. -The police have located the Clarkson girl. -Where is she? She has a room in a flop house hotel over a waterfront saloon. Here's the address. Shanghai Low. A real joint. The police have located the Clarkson girl. -Where is she? -Okay. Waiter! Give me the check. [people applauding] Well, I'm back again, you lucky people. Anybody at all. Just sing it out. [man 1] Do Jimmy Durante. Durante? All right. Jimmy Durante. [man playing piano] Nothing, huh? [sighs] The more I think, the less I... The less I can remember where I could have seen him. Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do. -[people laughing] -I'll go, I'll stay. Come on, let's get out of here. [man 2] Do Rin Tin Tin. I can't bark like a dog, but I can howl like a wolf. That wolf joke. He's used it before. Oh, I remember now. It was at the Elliot home. There was entertainment and he was there. He kept talking to Artie. He was very interested in him. [exclaims] When was the party? It was two days before Mickey was killed. [people applauding] Well, that's about it for now, folks. Why don't you all dance? Do Artie Blane! [people applauding] Do Artie Blane. [band playing lively music] Look at him. I'll be back. Uh... Back here is for the entertainers only. Yeah, I know. I want Jordan. Official business? What's it to you? Well, you got a warrant? Want me to get one? Second door. Thank you. Hey! [screaming] Shut up! You wanna start a riot? Mr. Fremont. I'm all right. I'm all right. He's dead. Call the police. Go on, call the police! Looks like the end of the line, doesn't it? [groans] Not if Sylvia Clarkson's still alive. Come on. You know that plane ain't gonna wait all night. This ain't no joy ride. So get in, go ahead. Park it in the back. Wait for me. Follow the dame. I'll get word to Harrison about him. [jazz music playing] What'll you have? Scotch. Hi, honey. Buy me a drink? Yeah, sure. Give her a... Scotch all right? Yeah. Well, I hope you get rich. They got nerve. Who wants to work in a crummy saloon in Manila? What's the difference? All you gotta do is learn how to say "Buy me a drink" in Spanish. I only know one word in Spanish. Si.Yes. Honey, that's one word you'd better forget. Hey, that's good. What's with them? They taking a trip? Oh, who cares? Me, I like it here. I've been looking for Sylvia. Sylvie, you know where she is? Baby, you're with me. Buy me another? Be my guest. What's the matter? That guy out there at the bar, don't you know who he is? No. Well, who is he? Just the State's Attorney. Fremont? You looking for somebody? Yeah, a friend. I'm friendly. Yeah, I know. But I'm supposed to meet Sylvie. Oh, that new fancy dame. Yeah, you know where she is? I don't remember so good. She's in her room upstairs, 14. Those stairs will get you there. I told him I didn't want to go, I got friends here. You think your friends can keep you from having your head caved in? Fremont! Yeah. What do you say we talk? Don't move, mister. That goes for you, too. Stay put. Now, outside. Oh, you. Come on, you're coming with me. Come on! No! No, I'm not going anywhere. Get out! Get out of here. You perjured yourself on the stand, you lied. [stammering] No... No, I didn't. You can't prove I did. You lied. A man's gonna die because of that. I don't want any more trouble. Get out, get out! Oh, you're scared, aren't you? You're really scared. They told you they'd kill you if you didn't testify against Blane, didn't they? That's it, isn't it? Isn't it? No. No, I told the truth. Oh, you did. We happen to know that, that tape recording was a fake. Now do you think they're gonna let you live with what you know? What do you mean? I mean, they've killed Candymouth. They just killed the man who made the recording. Now who do you think is gonna be next? No. No. You're trying to trick me. You want to take a look at the bodies in the morgue? They said they'd let me go when this is over. [sobbing] They said they'd let me go. Then you admit they threatened you? [sobbing] Mr. Fremont, I don't want Artie Blane to die. But if they've killed all those other people, what chance have I got? You'll have police protection. Nothing can happen to you. What do you want me to do? I want you to tell me the truth. I want you to tell me how they forced you to testify against Blane. I want a full statement. Well? All right. Look. This is my home address. You go there and wait for me. Is there a back way out of here? Uh-huh. Take a cab. Come on. Go on. Hurry. [knock at door] That'll be Harrison. -Where is he? -He's upstairs. No, wait. Check the room. What's the matter? She brush you off? Oh, yeah, you know. You still got me, baby. Come on, buy me a little drink. Did he get to the girl? Gilkey's out cold. The girl's gone. Yeah, that's why he's stalling around. To give her a good start. He won't go anywhere. Duncan's got his car covered. All right, go after him. But get that Clarkson girl. What do we do with her? Take her to the airport. The airport? With all those dames? I said the airport. Now, move. Did you see her? -Yeah, she'll cooperate. -Oh. Where is she? I sent her on ahead to my house. I got to get to a phone and call Jake. Come on. [groaning] Where is she? Sylvia? -[yells] -Talk. [grunts] Talk! [Duncan] Talk! Stop it, you'll kill him! Sure, we'll stop. You tell us where she is. I don't know, I don't know. Please don't hit him anymore. I don't know, I don't know. Just leave him alone. Okay. [grunting] Please, stop it! Stop it! Please! [sobbing] All right, I'll tell you. Don't hit him anymore. Okay. [stutters] She... She's at his house, where he lives. All right, kid. But you just go along for insurance. Jake. Jake, forget about Jordan. Just get over to my house. Yeah, my house, quick. [door opening] Jim. [mutters] -You all right? -Jim, you're face. Where's Sylvia Clarkson? Jim, what happened? Will you answer me? Where is she? Did she get here? About five minutes ago. [Jake] Hey. What's going on here? I found the Clarkson girl. She told me she'd talk. I sent her over here for safekeeping. I'm trying to find out what happened to her. A couple a men forced their way in. She fought them and I tried to help. But they said they'd kill me if I interfered. I could see they had Laura Barton in the car outside. They took both girls. Where? I don't know. Did they say anything? Anything at all? Well, the Clarkson girl was screaming. There was something about a plane. I'll call headquarters and have them ground every outbound plane. Jim, I'm going to get you to a doctor. I have to go with Jake. Don't. Helen, if anything happens to those women, I'm responsible. I'm responsible. Use every car in the area. Get right on it. -Jake. -Yeah. Send a squad car to the Fremont house, I want it covered. Cars 104 and 109. Emergency. Proceed to airport. Car 104 reporting. We're on our way to the airport. Keep in touch with the control tower. I want to make sure no plane leaves the ground. Where we stopping first? San Diego. We refuel there. Well, where do you pick up the other plane? Hey, what's Harrison doing here? Smitty and Duncan get here yet? No, were they supposed to? -Get those women off the field. -What? Out of the plane and into that bus. Okay. Take them into town. Spread them around. Drop them anywhere. Sure, boss. What's up? Is the flight canceled? Don't you worry about that, you just be ready to take off. -[indistinct shouting] -Where to? We'll tell you later. Now warm up the motors. Come on, girls, get outta the plane. Come on, come on. [chattering] [tires screech] [car horn honks] Where did you find them? Fremont's house. Fremont! Anybody see you? Yeah, his wife. Get them on the plane. Please, I did everything you wanted. Let me go. Let me go. [sobbing] Please, I did everything you wanted! You're never satisfied, are you? You got Artie, now you have to get me. You can't go on killing everybody, Harrison. Someday they're gonna catch up with you. On the plane. What do we do with them? Lose them. Lose them, do you understand? So long as they're alive, we're in trouble. Then you and Duncan get out of the country. [Smitty] Out of the country? Fremont's wife saw you. What do you want to do? Hang? Now get going! No. No, please! Please, no. We're not going to get out of here, Mr. Harrison. Why not? The control tower's ordered every plane grounded. You taking orders from me or from the control tower? Now get this crate in the air! I'll lose my license-- You still want to argue? Now get going! [sirens wailing] The cops! Cars 104 and 107, block the runway. That's them up ahead. They're getting away. [tires screech] Hang on. They're gaining on us. [tires screeching] [sirens wailing] [gun fires] Get him! [gunshots continue] [narrator] Ken Harrison, badly wounded, lived for three days. Before he died, he gave the police and State's Attorney James Fremont enough information to completely crush the crime organizations set up by the union mobsters. Artie Blane, cleared of complicity in the Partos murder, regained the presidency of the WNB. in a unanimous vote. And on James Fremont's desk, was proof that the high offices of our land cannot be corrupted if men of courage are willing to fight for what is right and decent.
