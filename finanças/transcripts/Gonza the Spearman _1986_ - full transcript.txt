From 1635 on, the shogunate... ordered provincial lords to edo... alternate years this allowed the tokugawa government a means of control since then a century has passed the lord is departing! Gonza the spearman the lord is departing! Executive producers/kiyoshi iwashita, masatake wakita, masayuki motomochi script by taeko tomioka make way! Hiromi go as gonza sasano shohei hino as bannojo misaka tanaka as oyuki hideji otaki as iwaki takashi tsumura as ichinoshin kuniko miyake as his wife haruko kato as oyuki's nurse kaori mizushima as okiku shima iwashiti as osai directed by masahiro shinoda the bout is over! Oh, what a handsome samurai... everyone just stares at him... at gonza, the spearman, such a dandy as though a picture that's come alive... gonza, the spearman, such a handsome man oyuki! I'm all sweaty bring me a change of clothes gonza, why must you avoid me... like this? Why, oyuki? If you so hate me... why not just run me down? I was just now getting rid of the man how can you, a samurai, lie like that? What are you saying? You're bannojo's sister how could i go flattering you? Nurse, you're thoughtless... letting her come this far how can you say that? Do you remember what you said when you met... oyuki at my house last winter? I did not forget. I keep my promises now take oyuki back home and you have never kindly answered... her letters you have not done right by her speak to bannojo, her brother, and... the marriage can be arranged if that is what you intend but if not, then say so clearly and we will no longer trouble you bannojo is difficult i must be careful how i speak only if he were to fully agree could i... marry oyuki even my horse here knows i love her he will testify. Listen carefully it's bannojo he mustn't see us oyuki, let us go gonza, you out riding too? Your horse's gotten better, right? No, i don't even feed it well it's no good sarcasm? Because you beat me... when we raced? How about another race now? I wish i could but we're tired - the horse and me perhaps another time very smart let's race! A letter from bannojo from bannojo? He said he would come for an answer to osai from bannojo madame... mr. Iwaki, your father, has arrived torajiro-has your fencing improved? Yes, grandfather welcome, father- jinbei too do be careful when you play with... the child i am sorry and you might scratch the walls as well but boys ought to be active like this torajiro you are always with that fool shall i tell your father? I want to be as strong as uncle is a real honour you are only twelve fencing is not enough your father is also excellent at the... tea ceremony that is how he received his new post... and new raise you ought to study tea ceremony... as well for a samuarai, the martial arts must... come first there are no more wars, no battles now samurai must serve in different ways i don't like this new peaceful world even samurai musicians - how weak nothing weak about the tea ceremony that is true but you spoke differently... when just married your husband wasn't manly becasuse... he liked... the tea ceremony who said that? Father, that's all in the past where are you off to? Stay with your grandfather i can't stay long today we're on our way to a meeting dropped by to see torajiro, that's all then take him home and... make him study here he just wastes his time they'll say i spoiled him... during my husband's absence when will father be back? Do you miss him so much? It's only been three months grandfather, uncle, you are welcome how is it? Excellent please, get ready tea ceremony has its disciplines it's like fighting except that you don't get killed and it helps the better to get you... promoted i wish i could study it too you can't do that let's look at the tea thing bannojo, you're lucky you're ichinoshin's disciple and... so you have a bright future as samurai like us, we can't even try to use a sword that reminds me. When i was young i once tested... a sword on an executed man then on my way home i ate some fish i reminded me of the meat... on that corpse i had to run out to throw up that's too bad samurai nowadays leave... their sword behind you heard that, too? Something like that could happen to us this samurai was eating his meal as the ferryboat was about to go he got in a hurry... it was after he got off the ferry... that he remembered his sword you should have seen him run another got dismissed - left his sword... in a theater oyuki is more beautiful than ever any special reason? Not that i know of been three months since ichinoshin left it'll soon be a year no, a year is very long time yes, for wives waiting for... their husbands right many kill themselves when... the husband returns she's gone and committed adultery, you see why didn't she try absortion? Double suicide - it's a strange fashion our lord doesn't have a successor yet? With no son... our clan might be abolished and we'd be out on the streets no way we can help him that way you're pretty fast with women. You'll do i lost again. I can't pay you still have your hamlet and... your armor no not any more i sold them long ago who cares about these anti-gambling... laws? But a few days ago, kihei's place got raided ten people got arrested too bad well...? Well? This time... good why not join us? It's not just a game. We're betting real money your luck matters. It's interesting too bad it's muggy tonight and what is it brings you here today? It's been raining so long i just wondered how you were my husband is gone, but i have... my servants and i have my children too what are you thinking of... watching the rain? It's been 3 months since... your husband left but i'm glad he is doing well i am here for the answer to my letter i don't understand did the messenger bring it to the... wrong person? I only wrote to find out how you're doing i'm not brave enough to take... ichinoshin's wife but i thought i'd relieve your boredom does it rain in edo too? I wonder what your husband is doing... on a day like this my children will soon be back would you please leave now? The world is too peaceful waiting for war slows a samurai's... promotion stationed in edo, something goes wrong at home this is our reality osai let me help you during... your husband's absence... i'll call someone you're being too familiar gonza i have something for you here, look at this sash three lines in a circle. Your crest and a chrysanthemum. Mine take it it's wonderful i'm very happy it represents our love when it's tied... you are with me, and i am with you i made it so we would never be apart make way make way from edo! You made it an heir has been born the clan will survive so we will. The clan will live congratulations i had you two come to tell you this an heir has been born to our lord he will celebrate in edo at the end of the month... his family here will gather for... a celebration a tea-ceremony will also be held since my son-in-law is in edo... one of his disciples, learned in the art... should officiate at the party if either of you have such qualifications... would you kindly officiate? This would also be the means of... promotion i have not been officially initiated as yet but i do have some knowledge i, bannojo, accept this honor rest assured i will do my best and you? The true arcane knowledge of... the tea ceremony... ought be transmitted only... from parents to children... but my master has taught me... so i should make no errors making no errors is not perfection, i know... but do let me try myself it is not for us to decide. We must... also hear the opinions of... ichinoshin's wife should some error be made the shame would be our master's the tea-ceremoney secrets? I must beat gonza at this ichinoshin is in edo - osai is here alone where is your nurse? I don't know you two are hiding something now listen to me to get you married into a good family... i have to succeed to do so, i must beat gonza gonza? Right what about it? You seem always to be thinking of... gonza can't be helped. He's very handsome gonza and i are engaged... though he has not given... a definite answer what? My own sister? You cannot marry him why do you say i can't marry him? Because he is absolutely unfaithful gonza unfaithful? Can you prove that? You don't understand men you don't understand me i am gonza's i want him he won't marry you. He understands nothing not women, not life itself gonza and i are engaged brother, let me go! Stupid! Don't do that? Mr samurai, why not drop in? You are a samurai, aren't you? Why not just step in? She's a samurai's daughter - from osaka a very beautiful woman that girl? Please come in you like that girl? A guest has come excellent that is very good indeed your father will be surprised but so long before he comes back look at your hair. It's not well done who did it? The maid, after my bath it doesn't become you that girl never improves this doesn't suit you i'll do it for you this way suit you a woman's hair style is important the classics say a woman... with good hair is best there, you look better now here, i will prove it to you sugi! Will you come here? I hardly recognize you madame dresses hair so beautifully she looks even more beautiful i'm pretty myself... but men don't look twice it must be my hairdo if you were only to help, then all the men... would come rushing that's enough i could never marry such a... girl as you to an ordinary man. It would be a waste i am always thinking about... who would be... best if you married one of... our own samurai i wish i could marry you to gonza sasano he is most handsome, and the best spearman he is the best at the disciplines of... tea ceremony, too and he has the best character he is the best of all the men but he's old enough to be my uncle he is certainly like your uncle he is twenty-five. You are fifteen but i am thirty-seven and your father is... forty-seven his being ten years older is best in a few years you will accept it i myself would marry gonza... were i not already married to ichinoshin i wish you could wear the bridal kimono sitting side by side with gonza what is your business, sir is iwaki here? Not today, sir then give this message to the madame i have a favor to ask him but... will explain later in the meantime this sake is for her please enjoy it. Tell her that very well, sir you came at just the right time please come in everything seems well here thank you. And i much appreciate... your gift i have had no opportunity to speak... with you please come in okiku there will be a party to celebrate... the heir's birth how nice and i was assigned to officiate at the... tea ceremony i should be most grateful if... your showed me the family tea-scrolls that knowledge should be passed... from parents to children i know that well enough but in this peaceful time... it is my only way to distinguish myself please, i beg of you you are serious about this i too... excuse me, but i long wanted you to... wed my daughter we have long discussed here it woud make you my son-in-law and i could show you family secrets this may sound bartering trading our knowledge for our daughter but try to think of these as... really separate what do you say? You do not like my daughter? Or are engaged to someone else? Then we must give up do not be too hasty i am not engaged then... i will take your daughter okiku... as my wife thank you very much my wish is granted i am more than pleased now, swear your intentions... upon this sake the scrolls are our go-between. Swear of course, we have no real go-between so, let me hear your pledge i quite understand your care even though, all unarmed, i am killed... by lord ichinoshin... that is enough. I am grateful today is a lucky day. My husband too will be happy now, gonza, you are no longer... a stranger i will show you our secrets come to the tea-ceremony room... this evening this is very kind of you. I will come without fail come so that no one will see you excuse me. This is oyuki's nurse bannojo's sister would you announce me? The nurse to bannojo's sister? I must leave so that she will not see me very well i wonder what brings her here madame i heard. Tell her that i am out and don't let her see him come after everyone is asleep i will show you the scrolls i am very sorry, ma'am the madame is out on an errand but i'll take the message. What is it? Very well, then oyuki, whom i raised is engaged to gonza sasano, and everything is readied but there is no go-between as yet i helped them spend a night together and gonza gave me a pair of sandals... and a silver coin is that so? Then you did your job well but what is it that brings you here? I would like the madame here to be the go-between for gonza... and oyuki please tell her that. Understand? If everything turns out all right... we'll pay her we'll do our best for you too our lady would never do this for money but i will give her your message mother are you back? Is torajiro not with you? Madame's father is here mother, i'm back they played so hard they're sleepy. So, i brought them back is okiku in? She ought stay in so nothing occurs while... her father's away you played that hard? No wonder your grandparents complain my wife says that he looks just like... his father she's right torajiro, you act like your father take care of your mother take osute inside, put them to bed make sure they don't catch cold kakusuke why not light the stone lantern? It is already dark bring some sake for father thank you, but i would like to look at... the garden i admire ichinoshin's taste. This garden never bores did gonza ask to be shown... the secret scrolls? He came o his own. I decided to show him that is good basically, only family members have... the right but ichinoshin sent me permission if gonza made a mistake... it would shame ichinoshin would disgrace our lord as well that much i know you cannot be too careful in imparting... this knowledge let no one, not even in family, hear your conversation wait until after midnight, when all are asleep be especially careful while... ichinoshin is in edo your family is only women now and that undependable manservant oyuki is engaged to gonza? And everything is ready set? How that nurse spoke it makes me so angry, and jealous and i'm to be their go-between? Who cares now about our secrets? How jealous and angry i am and just when i have chosen him... for my daughter who could help being angry? Who is it? Gonza these drawings and these scrolls... explains all everything necessary for the ceremony is written in this list it includes methods for any occasion this is another possible form and here is for an imperial visit in our case the latter ought be applied this display is for the imperial visit it requires three scrolls and... three utensils a jar for powdered tea these are probably self-explanatory please study these carefully you hear anything in these? Only the frogs you do it like this! They have gone to sleep they're only women. We can gag them very well follow me i heard something. Is someone in the garden? No - no one comes, even in daytime the frogs have been silenced even frogs must rest they're quiet again that's odd i'll go look in the garden high fences and a thorn hege who could get in? What's the matter? Afraid of being alone with me? Afraid your woman will rush in? That is false! Someone's nurse said... you were engaged came to ask me, of all people, to be go-between still false? I'm very angry. You are the false one now i see you as you truly are i have reasons... i've been stifling this anger because i your mother-in-law, ought not be jealous but i can endure no longer who embroidered that sash of yours? Your own crest and another. Whose is it? I have my reasons... of course, you have, and i am jealous... of them how dare you wear that when... you come here? Filthy thing! My hands are all dirtied you still want it? You need another one? Why not use mine? There now. Use mine it is like me. It will cling to you i couldn't wear a woman's sash osai! Gonza! These proclaim that you are adulterers i will tell everyone why are you doing this? He took the sashes. We cannot prove our innocence he's the adulterer this is the end the sashes are gone. What should we do? Dead or alive, this is the end what a disgrace my husband could not face... the other samurai... if gossip had it that his wife was stolen they will make us out... to be immoral beasts... low, degenerate i cannot live if you must die, then make yourself an adulterer and... have my husband kill you what? Shame! I have not committed adultery let him kill me as i am now and our deaths my prove our innocence if you die to save our reputations... then my husband's will be disgraced if you refuse adultery, then... call me your wife - just one word i beg you call me your wife no I cannot do that i know your feelings, but think of... my husband i am sorry i cannot call a married woman my wife dawn is coming my luck has ended i will save your husband just call me your wife you are... my wife and you are my husband osai and gonza ae adulterers! As evidence... i, bannojo, hold their sashes ichinoshin's wife, osai, and... gonza sasano are adulterers i have their sashes as evidence ichinoshin's wife, osai... and gonza sasano they are adulterers i, bannojo, have their sashes... as evidence i had planned to break into... osai's room and get the scrolls i wanted to beat gonza but, as it turns out... osai, the sun is rising. Your children will wake up and they know nothing of this... forget them. Let us go open the gate! It's jinbei! Open up! Open the gate! I'm coming what's happened? I am here to see gonza welcome back, father we are here to bring back... the adulteress' personal possessions open the gate and receive them do not leave them here. What shame for osai bring them in before people can see... them what are you saying? The will only dirty our house destroy them! No, wait do as you're told wait please listen i am stopping you because... we will never see osai while... we are alive cannot we at least keep these... to remember her by? It's been twenty years, but they look new she kept them for our grandchildren osai... she will never return we cannot accept them men, destroy them! Listen... an even greater tragedy will fall upon us what shall we do? Our daughter will die. But we must live and endure our sorrow i want my mother. Where is she? Grandmother, i miss mother in all your lovely innocence... how could she... abandon you? Father will kill her grandfather, grandmother. Please kill me instead well said you still have your grandparents don't worry. And jinbei is here. Don't cry ichinoshin sent us our grand-daughters then why not torajiro? He is our grandchild, too a courier has brought a letter... from jinbei a letter from jinbei? They're coming jinbei is coming you must go right now get ready brother, i can walk no more i can go no further. I cannot walk jinbei is coming he's a good swordsman but you've killed no one hurry up no more i'm tired of running no more oyuki ichinoshin! I accept osai's daughters and... her belongings going on a journey? Thank you for coming. I wish you luck what is the matter with you? You came back all the way from edo yet osai is still alive. What shame! Jinbei is looking for her he sent me a letter he found where bannojo was though old, i can still walk i cannot just sit and wait bannojo was the one who told everyone i will kill him myself i know how you feel. But you are old he might kill you then i would first have to avenge... my father-in-law you still call me a father-in-law? Yes, even though osai is an adulteress i will avenge your death ichinoshin, how grateful i am to you if she had not done this then... all the family would be here you are keeping torajiro? And abandoning our family? That is not the way it is my lord has given me leave. I have no duties but i would still like to continue... my tea ceremony so i asked the master to accept... torajiro is that how it is? Now with this sake wish me luck i wish you all success success in killing the mother of... three children success in killing my wife. And this is duty? What a world we live in jinbei? How was it? I am very sorry they asked i kill them before... you arrived home i started out after them right away rest a while first with a woman they cannot have gotten... far yet, though i searched everywhere i could not find them ichinoshin is going too this is fortunate. Let me go with you i appreciate your kindness but i ought go alone but why? Gonza has many relatives they will do anything you will need help. Let me go thank you but i cannot kill my wife... with her brother's help i want to do all i can for you you imply i know nothing but... tea ceremony? No, i know swordsmanship as well then why not kill the enemy... who is right here the enemy right here? You mean bannojo? If you know all, kill him first i did find his letter to her but i have this other duty first i shall save him for later you said you did not need my help, but you have many duties come here look it's bannojo. No mistake well done he deserved our anger and hatred he was hiding in a nearby village no, i beg you... i will never interfere with your duty no, no! Let's go kakusuke! What is the matter with you? Where are you going? Let me go to my father! What is this? Where are you going? My sisters are all women, but i am a man i'm going to revenge my father then you will kill your own mother? Not my mother, but i will kill gonza i will go with father grandfather, tell him to take me... with him listen well your grandparents will be all alone and your sisters are women. What if gonza comes? You stay here and get him. All right? Continue your tea-ceremony study. Come to... see your grandparents sometimes and kill gonza if he comes if you are afraid to be left alone, i will take you i will stay and i will kill gonza do not worry about us. Please go i am happy you understand. I will go father! Kill gonza but, mother... bring her home bring back mother, father and she abandoned such children what shame! I no longer care. Kill her as you will make up another bed sorry, we're full. No more beds make the best of it married couples everywhere i've never envied farmers before but now i do. They're always together how hot! Just sitting i am perspiring and i must wash this kimono thank you very much how do you feel? I feel better come and look! We bring you a drama of real adultery! They elope but get killed! A popular drama! See even only one act! The best part's now starting! I feel like we're thieves, wanted by the police is ichinoshin really headed for kyoto? Yes, i am certain he knows i have relatives here it's not difficult to chase down a couple there are many couples passing but we are the adulterers everyone can tell you are still using that word yet, as we left, you called me your wife and i have already abandoned... my children you made me call you my wife... for your husband's sake to be killed as an adulterer is one thing to be killed as a sacrifice to... your husband is another are you still thinking of that? I never wanted to be married him i always wanted to marry you. Understand? That is not true you only felt that way... because your husband was not... with you had he been then i... would have been just another of... his retainers why must men obey the past the way... you do? Gonza don't you know i love running away... with you? There are so many people... here in kyoto - they won't notice us no, we'll go to osaka there are even more people there you want to go on living? You are not yet resigned to death? We'll get married. Then... married for the sake of your husband that is too much when we have come this far together have you no emotions at all? Cannot you forget that... samurai pride of yours? Can't you hold me to you? Hold me! We'll marry before we die it's been seven days now it's hopeless to look for them here let's move to fushimi the ferries for osaka start from there we can watch everyone there gonza... stay here why not stay here? Guests! Bring some water five guests make yourselves at home if they go to osaka they'll take this ferry let's separate ferry is leaving! Ferry to osaka! Everyone aboard! It's rare to see such a good sword you really want to sell it? I'm not here to be judged. I am here to sell what's the matter? Why are you crying? Stop crying, now be a good child, now stop crying, now master, jinbei has found them! Master! Here? You do it the earliest ferry? This one. It leaves at six but what a small one it's not small see? A young couple's already here there's lots of space you can sit over there no, i'll take one tomorrow ferryman we've forgotten something important we have to buy something for someone where are you going? Shopping? We'll go through town to fujinomori fujinomori? You know how far that is? It is very far - we cannot wait for you that's all right. We'll pay anyway master. What is the matter? I cannot take money if you do not board you've already boarded, so just stay i know you do not want to take money... for nothing but we must go. We have this duty please let us go. I beg you then go on if you must don't hurt yourself - not when your're already hurt now that jinbei is here, ichinoshin is here too they'll kill us, just as you desired osai, are you ready? Of course. My life belongs to him we wanted to live it was only a dream how lovely they are, looking like that the children i left are just that age we've come so far there is no way to know how they are okiku will not dance... at this year's festival gonza sasano! Adulterer! I am here for revenge! I have expected this i must now fight for a samurai's honor he only had a wooden sword jinbei! Please don't kill him! Let my husband kill him! He's only a good swordsman. He needs no help die! If i had a bamboo pole... i could use it like a spear i have missed you, my husband please kill me everyone just stares at him... at gonza, the spearman, such a dandy... as though a picture that's come alive... gonza, the spearman, such a handsome man make way! Make way! No more adultery, i hope i will begin how is it, sir? Excellent
