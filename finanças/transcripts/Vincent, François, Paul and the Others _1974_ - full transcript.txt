Watch out! They catch fast. Why did you break off that branch? It was already broken. Come on and play! Right, let's go! Francois, will you play goalie? Vincent your jacket is the goal. I'm warming up. I was closing a window because of the wind. Catherine... No, I was upstairs. You want to talk to Vincent? How have you been? We're fine... They're all outside somewhere. Use of hands! Free kick... - Who? - Him. Are you nuts? Francois... Come on... drop back. Get ready. Can I kick forward? Not forward. My ankle... What a goal! Beautiful... But I set it up for you, right? Look at them. Pass the ball. We'll show them... The shed! - What's in it? - Tools, rabbit hutches... Rabbits? No... get out of the way! Wasn't anyone around? I should have watched the kids... Beat it! Keep calm... Don't panic. Bring an extinguisher! - Do you have one? - In my car! Let's call the Fire Department. For this? We'd look ridiculous. Jean, watch out! Watch out for the tree! The butane gas... There are two bottles in there! What can I do? Idiots! Get back! It may blow up! - Paul, call him! - I am calling him. Are you crazy? Are you hurt? - Quit dramatizing... - Two bottles! One's empty! Didn't you take the empty one? Pour it on! I am but... Effective. It works. - Isn't that the phone? - Yes, I'll go. I'll take a look inside. What courage. Vincent... telephone! I'm coming. Someone should stand guard. It's Catherine. She called before but... Paul's shed caught on fire. Julia told you... My watch, you jerk! I don't have any other clothes. I'm serious... look. His watched drowned. No, nothing serious. Yes, if you want. Yes, me too. Any beer around? Damn cork... Push it in. Can I use the towel? I'll have some sausage. You put on weight, Jean. Athletes! If they quit, they bloat. I haven't quit. Who's that? It's Jack. What a surprise... quote, an-quote! This is a hard place to find. I got back three days ago. Do you know Marie? And Jean? You're the boxer. He's really changed in three years. Would you help outside? Are you in Paris to stay? They built a lab near Paris, so I applied. Will it pan out? I think so. Isn't Catherine here? Are you sleeping here? - Yes. - Great. Forget it... Find some lumber... we'll rebuild it next Sunday. No stunt driving, Jean. Who'd start a fire so near the shed? - Me - Brilliant. The wind changed and I couldn't foresee that. Children... - You should have. - But I didn't. You could've watched, at least. I didn't foresee or watch, and I am stupid. Are you happy now? What's wrong? Francoise... come on! Come on, hurry up. What now? I just got a tune up. Very funny! Unhooking the battery... I don't even want to know who did it. Hilarious! Why aren't you laughing, Marie? I had an article to finish... So I finished it. Then I tried... I tried to work on my book. I can't anymore. How about some coffee? I have to go. Put your medal in your mouth for the X-rays. Breathe deeply... Hold your breath... You can get dressed. Is that all, doctor? I'll see you in my office. I'm going... Make Francoise take the medicine. Let them play and feed them at 8 o'clock. I'll call before dinner. Excuse me. Could it be nerves? We'll find out. We'll run some blood tests. He hates that. Yes, I'll take it. Why does Vincent want to see us? Tomorrow is impossible. How about 4 o'clock today? Come by and we'll go in my car. Then it disengages and it clears. Jean, you stay here. Fantastic machine. Works to 1/100 of a millimeter. Only... it costs money. Did Paul tell you? Yes I did... about Catherine. The apartment's quieter. Isn't that Marie? What are you doing here now? Are you coming or going? Going. I came back to change. Do you want to have dinner at my parents? It's a Condrieu. Well that's it. Catherine wants a divorce, and I... You what? You've been separated for 2 years. I'm not arguing, but... Is he kidding? My lawyer says that if she suddenly wants a divorce. She's got something in mind... or someone. Because I've done nothing to her. I either defend myself or else. Defend yourself against what? Who knows. Anything can happen. When a woman is no longer yours... So I need letters. I hate to, but if I can't ask you, who can I ask? What kind of letters? Certifying that you know me and... We also know Catherine. It's just a formality for the files. She'll have them, too. I wonder who she'll ask. Our wives. So what you want is... "Both parties at fault". That's it. What do we write? That she cheated on you? No don't go that far... Paul, you're a writer. You can find a way. There's a pen. After all, she's the one that walked out. You said it was your doing. "I said, I said"... that's not the point. The point is that I'm still here. It was all because of Marie, but... But it was Catherine who actually moved out. Vincent, without prying, what do we write? We don't know the detail we weren't here. We could say that when we came here... that we were always... Right! We never noticed anything special. That you never saw me angry. I led a normal life. That I loved her. I don't think we can. Yes, you can. Are you writing? Yes. What are you writing? So far, I've only put the date. I need to say who I am... How I know him... That's the easy part. What a crock of shit! I can't do it. Why didn't you tell him? Listen... We agreed that... If the delivery to me was delayed... I could delay the payment. Now you tell me to pay the promissory or else! Yes... okay. What did you write? Me, nothing. Anyway, it's not urgent. Do it at home and mail them to me. That's best. I could ask you over the phone. Are you coming to Clovis' later? It's the grand re-opening. He remodeled the place. It's fantastic. What's wrong? What's the matter? This time, I'm trapped. I need $30,000 in 3 days... ...and I don't have it. I have to pay Becaru. He said he'd wait when the machine came in late. But now he's reneged. And LMC canceled their order. Why? It's complicated... Cut-backs in production, they say. If you don't pay, what happens? I'm bankrupt. For one bill? It's impossible. It's possible! I'm mortgaged... There is no way out. I've had it. Can you ask... Who? Armand. He'd understand... it happened to him. Yes, it happened to him... That's the problem... He hasn't got $30,000. And the banks? The banks! One bank lets another know. Well, what can I lose? I'll call Segal... and ask him to see me. Negative. Banks will lend you three umbrellas... if it rains. Where to now? To see Armand. No. Becaru. He's gone, but his manager's there... He said of the machine arrived late, I could delay the payment. We made an oral agreement! You were there! Becaru's gone, and I don't know where he is. My promissory note is not gone! It was to be delivered! We said it! Becaru said it! You said it! Yes, Mr. Becaru said it. But he changed his mind. I can't do anything. And neither can you. Damned, it's closed. Try the workshop. It'll be closed too. His house... He lives in the suburbs. Call first. Look, Betty, it's very important... No, I'll call back. Thank you. He's at a meeting. Until when? She doesn't know. Marie expected me an hour ago. I'm meeting Colette, and my motorcycle is... - Where? - At the gym. You should see this kid's camp. Even the house is pretty. - Where is it? - In Normandy by the sea. Three to a room... she loves it. Classes either in the morning or the afternoon. The other half-day, they sail or hike. Only we can't visit or call her. Why not? They say it's best for the children. Vincent isn't eating? How old is she now? Ten. Vincent... Very good. It's cold. May I use the phone? Of course. In the office, 2nd door. Betty? It's Vincent again. Forgive me... Listen, I'm going home now. Tell Armand to call me, no matter how late. Thanks, Betty. Goodbye. Where's your car? I lent it to Dominique. Do you mind if I come with you? Not at all. Why are you talking that way? I'm not talking at all. I'm like you. Vincent... What? What have I done? Nothing... I'm just tired. You, only you. Not only me. Just look at the others. The other come on time, and eat and talk. Like what? They were happy to see you. The tried to please you. But all you care about is you. - They must miss Philippe. - You have to be the center of the universe. Don't you think the others love you... - I've got problems. - And so have I! - I've got problems. - And so have I! Let's skip it tonight and talk tomorrow. No! Not tomorrow! I can't go on like this. Maybe. No, not maybe... We've grown apart Vincent. Maybe it's just age... I'm only 25. I've wanted to leave before. Now I've told you... and I'm leaving. Give me a beer! Vincent! Vincent! Hello, Clovis. I'm glad you came. They said you might not come. It's completely different. It's too crowded as you can see. You invite 60 people and 300 show up. Wait till you see the upstairs. Miriam, look who's here. Aren't you handsome. You think so? - I think so. - What'll you have? A coffee. It's bigger, isn't it? We knocked out the glass partition. Has Armand been in? No, but Paul's here... drunk as a skunk. Are you cooking my beer, or what? - Here. - Thank you. My good old pal... you're here at last! These letters of yours are a drag. I was talking and I... Sorry! Does beer leave a stain? Can I use the phone? Plug in the phone back there. I've got to make a phone call. I'll see you later. Have you seen who's here? Marco! Don't you know me, boy? You haven't changed a bit. I've got gray hair now, but it pays off. Have you met my fianc?e? Arlette! Where'd he go? Jack! Armand? This is Vincent... In 48 hours. Listen, Vincent. You know I haven't got $30,000. I can come up with ten, in a pinch. Eight or ten at most. For the rest... Where will you be tomorrow? Alright... Forget it... See you tomorrow. Am I disturbing you? What's wrong? You don't look very... Is it Catherine? No, it's not Catherine. I've... got money problems. Money? It's temporary... but urgent. I won't ask you how much, because you know what the story is at the clinic. And even with two partners, the money goes. Forget it. Everybody panics sometimes and... You know what I mean. I'll work it out. It's such a bitch... If you'd asked me before... what's the date? What can I say? Don't say anything. Do want a drink? Nothing. No drink, no smoke, not anything. Can't I get you anything? Like what? I don't know... ice cream... cake... Okay, ice cream. You just got here? As you can see. You went to the movies. Was it any good? Bad. Shall we go? - Already? - I work tomorrow, remember? - Goodbye - Goodbye Jack. Don't leave now. It's just starting... Lucie looks better than ever, huh? Apparently she and Francois aren't getting along. What did you do today? Why do you ask every time? You know... One never knows. Yes you do. Vincent looked worried. Is anything wrong? He has problems... Money problems. - Vincent? - Yes, Vincent. He even tried to tap me. - For how much? - I have no idea. Didn't you even ask? You bastard. Bastard? You sleep with anyone, you tell me, and I'm the bastard? Great. I tell you because you ask. It's not the same. What do they all have? What's the attraction? They have something you've lost. That's it... youth! Not always. They don't even have your intelligence, nor your... ...vigor. But they're alive. What does that mean? They bring me to life... you don't. You can't because you despise us. Who is "us"? All of us... Your children, your friends, your wife... Even your profession. You're a cash register. Bloodless and suffocating. So I breathe elsewhere. There! Then why do you stay with me? What's your guess? Out of habit? Because of the children? No... Then it's security. That's it... for the money. And why do you stay? Certainly not for the money. Why do I stay? Why do I live with this whore? Why? Francois, stop! Your cufflink... Let's go back and look for it. No, I'll call Clovis tomorrow. Sunday... out at my house, right? Tell the others. Watch your head! - Why didn't Jean come? - I don't know. Someone forgot his hat! See you Sunday. Vincent? What's the matter? But what's wrong? What time is it? Where are you? But... you weren't along. I wasn't but I am now. It's really stupid of me. I'm sorry... I wasn't thinking. It's darker, right? Something's different. Yes. I like it. It's been so long... The last time was... ...when we played those silly games. So I was at Clovis'... I already told you that. I didn't know where to go, so... I mean... I wanted to see you. You're seeing me. Have you been drinking? Do you want some coffee? It's not about the divorce. I think that. In fact, it's best that we... What's wrong? I'm in trouble. I'm sinking slowly... Maybe all the way... I need $20,000. I need it tomorrow... ...or I'll go under. That's all. And you can't find it? You? Me. I can't find anyone anywhere. It's never happened to me before. When it happens... ...it's the desert. Can you open a window? I know you can't do anything. I just wanted to... I don't know what I want. I needed to see you, to talk. You understand. But I'll pull out of it. You know me. Just telling you has helped me. I'll manage. I'm tired and I don't have to pretend with you. But don't worry... I'll come out of it. Good morning, Vincent. Catherine called me when she got to work. How'd you get in? What time is it? 10:15! She left the key in the lock. I came by pretty late. We had to talk. That's why I'm here. Catherine told me. You mustn't let yourself. What I always liked about you was your... Whenever they said "Vincent..." I'm sorry it can't be for long, but... for a month I could... I have $22,000. I can lend it to you. I don't need 22, I need 20, but... If I say I'd repay it in a month, I'd be lying. I couldn't pay it back before three months. Thank you, but no... Just three months? That's possible. I'm selling the apartment in Paris... to buy a little house in Avignon. Did she tell you? Pay it back to Catherine. Because all next month, her mother and I will be in the South. Are you in a hurry? No, but I'm hungry. What's her father do? He's retired now. He was a mechanical engineer and... The accountant, I have to see him. For Monday morning I want... - Do you want endives? - Yes. I want our exact financial status. Can you do it? I want to know where I stand. I told Armand you'd be here for lunch. Good. I may fight next month. Great. Against who? Catano. Do you know who he is? Potatoes instead of endives. How much will you get? They offered $1,500. So start training. I'm in shape... it's not that. What is it then? It's Catano! Nobody else will fight him. I haven't signed yet. What does you manager say? What's his name? Avakian. He's for it. He fixed it up. There's Armand. I came by earlier. Jean told me. Marie was just leaving... She was moving out. We split up. Lunch? Do you know Mr. Farina? I know who you are. A drink? It might be possible to help you out. It's taken care of. If you came up with what you said... I've got the rest. Thanks, anyway. Not at all. There's a free table. Because You know Farina can... Yes, I know but... Just saying hello. Hands off! Wait five minutes. That's what I'm doing. Marie and I got together for breakfast. Is it true they split up? I guess. You know as much about it as I do. Is the spaghetti ready? Drain it and add butter. How's he doing? I'm two weeks late. I'm two weeks late. I'll have to marry you. You don't have to. Neither do you. I hear you have a fight. Maybe. It sure is cold. Just look at you. Ask Paul for a sweater. What are your measurements? 22 by 2 by 22. It won't hold. The wood's rotted. Put it where the wood isn't rotted. You've no patience. That's right. Here we are. Joe Catano. Age 27, middle-weight, undefeated as an amateur. 38 pro fights, 32 wins, 18 by KO. 2 draws, 2 defeats... unbeaten since 1971. Last victory... KO'd Mono Rodriguez in the third. That's Catano. I say don't sign. Why not? Don't you get it? No. After all, you've always said... "Jean is good. He just can't get a money fight." That's why he's learning a trade, right? A "money fight" is one thing, and a massacre is another. But that's not it. So he shouldn't fight if he might lose? You really don't get it. One must have a chance. To get slaughtered? Jean is good. He has a style, but... Catano is a killer. I know. I saw him two years ago. His opponent had style. What was his name? Hamadoui. Yes. He didn't last two rounds! He was carried out on a stretcher. As he said... a massacre. He never fought again. Get me a screw. You dramatize everything. You can't make money if you're choosy. I ought to know. Medicine isn't boxing! Drop it! It's Jean's business. Listen, Jean. If you need any advice, ask me. If you've got one chance in a thousand... take it. Or you'll be left at the post, like Gilbert Pillot. Who? Don't you know Gilbert Pillot? He doesn't know him. Who? A character in Paul's novel. Gilbert Pillot is... or was... We haven't heard from him in ages. Any idea what's become of him? No. I'm starting to get worried. And you Paul? Last I heard, he was hiding in a railroad station. "He had two young SS men in his sights." Gilbert is still wondering whether to shoot. Only Paul knows the outcome. You're book! Sure. Gilbert Pillot was... The hero. In a dilemma, like his author. Thirty years after the war. "Finger on the trigger, he wondered whether or not to shoot." Some people never wonder. With heroes like you and Gilbert in the stations... the SS can travel in peace. That's enough leave him alone. Let him continue. It amuses him. I don't know why, but it does. I think I went too far. It really doesn't matter. If we bugged you about your book every Sunday... you'd be forced to finish it. Give me a light. I'll finish it. I have a conclusion. What? The memoirs of Maresco. The Romanian dancer with a peg leg. Very good! You really worked! Naturally. When did you start it? - Ten minutes ago. - Here's the bread. Got a sweater? I'm freezing. Upstairs, in the bedroom. - Where are the kids? - With friends. Red wine, or rose? You'll have to ask Paul. Then it's red. Vincent! Give me your glass. Do you want some more? It's perfect, Julia. - That's a leg of lamb. - What else? You were saying that the suburbs... No, further out. You can't recognize anything. Or anyone. There used to be nice little houses out there. Nicer than high-rise apartments. - Depends on which ones. - Some are good looking. They're usually office buildings. Or else very expensive. Julia... another knife. There's one with no handle. This is fine. The people who lived out there were evicted. They got relocated. In low-cost housing with sky-high rents. Yes, up in the mountains or out into the forests. It's no joke when you live 50 miles from work. And it's not funny... ...being shoved further out. Urban development is inevitable. One has to adapt. You're a riot. One needs money to adapt. Francois is right. Put up or shut up. Either get the money or you do without it. But don't bother us. Adapt? What does that mean? Get into the swing, move with the times... ...like Francois. The motto? "Change your ways... do what pays." It was different in the old days. He got mad if you mocked social progress. He believed in free clinics. Free clinics for worker's suburbs. Free medicine for the poor. Science is not for sale. We serve society... et cetera... That was his tune in the 1950's. Then suddenly, the record changed. Instead of free clinics... A fancy clinic in a chic locale. Still serving society... high society. That's urban development, my boy And move the others further out. That's adapting. It's always the same crap. Forever preached by misfits! A non-writing writer, a non-fighting fighter... ...and bed hopping women! Shit! And when we go, he'll stay... with his peg-legged dancer! Fuck off! You make me puke! All of you! Fuck your Sundays and your leg of lamb! No use letting it get cold! Here's a knife. Some wine... I'm not too good. It's cold now. Maybe with mayonnaise. Pass the wine. This one should be better. I'm an idiot. I don't know what to say. You've said it. It's my fault, too... It's grotesque... ...and I know it. You're not going to abandon us, are you? That's all we needed. You invited them. The shed's rebuilt already? Hardly worth burning it. My sister came. You don't mind? You shouldn't have. This is probably ruined. How are the exams? All finished. - And what now? - Nothing. Nothing? I want to find some useful kind of work. - Not just a job. - You have to eat. I am working, but that doesn't count. Clovis may cheat on me... but what I don't know can't hurt me. That's how I am. Careful it's rotten there. Rotten? Watch this. Put this coat on... You're shivering. It's not heated, you know. I lost a shoe in there. I do it every time, don't I? I'm just a... No, I love you. I wonder why? We're coming. Remember this is just a rough estimate. Overhead... $10,500... Including equipment. $17,500 owed to Social Security... The sum you still owe Becaru... Salaries for three months... Call it $150,000 to pay out. Receivables come to $60,000 at most. Unless fate sends you an order to replace LMC's. Finally there is the matter of taxes. Do you want to take a look at those figures? No... that's enough. I get the message. But when you say that you're selling... I'm selling. I'm getting out. Nothing will change for you. The shop won't close. But can't you ask for... What? I don't know... new mortgages. On what? Everything is mortgaged. I can't believe it. There's really no way to... There's no other way. Will you call Mr. Becaru? "Nothing will change for you." I'm not so sure. Hello, Mr. Avakian? It's Jean. I'm calling about the Catano bout. Yes, I'll take it. Whenever you want. Tomorrow morning is fine. When my uncle's wife died, do you know what he did? Don't worry. Anyway, the hammer is broken. What are you doing later? I'm meeting Colette. Then, I'll invite you to dinner. We'll celebrate. I'm selling? I'm selling! We'll get dressed and go to a little place I know. You'll like it. There was Armand, Jean's father and me. We started out in a shack with three machines. Three machines! None for him. His family moved away, leaving Armand and me. We expanded fast... we were young... and in four years we were out of debt. Then Armand wanted his own business. He went into industrial woodwork. I kept the metal workshop. I wanted to dazzle Catherine. To dazzle her with machines. I kept on and kept on until. But Armand always played it straight. Armand's all right. You don't like him much. That's a good one. Coffee and the bill, please. Becaru is coming tomorrow. He'll be licking his chops. Wait and see. I'll think it over. - You do that. - You too. I didn't realize you were so far in debt. It's still not a bad deal. I know. Becaru didn't like it? I don't like Becaru. Then, it's a deal. I want $30,000 now. Tonight. I was thirsty. You're looking very... - In top form? - I am. I smoke too much, maybe. While I'm thinking of it... What is it? The check for you father. I wrote him a note. It could have waited. I know but... I sold the business. I had a fantastic offer. I didn't want to, but... remember my money problem? I fixed that, but little things piled up. So I asked myself "Is it worth it?" So I sold, for my price and I'm very pleased. What will you do now? I don't know. I'll see. I've got lots of things in view. I'll take breather and start over... ...from scratch. And how are you? I'm fine. You're beautiful. The thing is... ...to start over alone... ...seems kind of sad. - You're not alone. - Yes, I am. The other night I thought... "What happened to us?" I know I was the one who... ...was wrong. But it's no good saying it now. Will you have lunch with me? I can't. You're cigarette is... That happens. I'm going to leave. Me, too. No, I mean... I'm leaving France. I see. For a long time? For your work? Not only for work. If I asked you to come back to me... ...will you stay? No. Why not? Because I can't. Not anymore. I asked you because... Naturally, I thought of it... What's your name now? The same as yours. How stupid of me. Of course. You'll keep in touch won't you? Always? Of course. We're waiting for you. Give him some. I'd like to have a little bit. Would you like to have a drink with me? - It's made from prunes. - Then just a bit. This is very nice. Is it a boat? No, it's the school. It's the school for boys. - Go get the other one. - Which one? The ones that you drew this morning. Are you okay, Vincent? Yes, I'm fine. Want to lose ten pounds with me? How old is Simon now? Thirty-four. He was born when I was 19. And I was 17. Nicole and Mark were born much later. When we left to live in Pontoise. You must remember. I have to go. Would like a little something? You can't get him drunk before his fight. But it's not till later. - He's fighting Catano. - So what? They broke my record player. I wonder if they fixed it. Do you want to play... You have anything against opera? I mean overtures. Learn to watch his left hand. You'll have a lot of trouble with Catano if not... You've got to work that. I've got to go. The trainer is right. You have to watch out for Catano's left. What's wrong? Are you tired? A little. He still has three weeks. I'm the one who started Jean boxing. I fought amateur, but couldn't make the weight. Jean has no problem. He climbs the scales laughing. Anyway, I never had a punch. Weight doesn't matter... Training hard doesn't help without a punch. What is it Vincent? Are you in less pain? Yes, it's better. I never expected this. He's so strong. Strength isn't what counts. The children. Go wash up and get a snack from Maria. Would you like something to drink? Are you going to fight? What does Colette say? She doesn't talk about it. Yes, Paul... I'll let Francois talk to you. Do you want to speak to Paul? Do you want to speak to him? Don't worry. He has to slow down, of course. I'm telling you not to worry. I'll tell him. Paul sends his regards. It could have been worse. But it's a warning. What now? We'll do an ECG to confirm... ...and keep you under observation. Then you'll rest up for a while... ...and that's all. But from now on... no alcohol... none of that. ...no violent physical effort. You're not twenty anymore. I know. While Vincent was in the Hospital. Catherine came to see him. Vincent said he was better, and it was true. He made her laugh. He was happy. He liked everything... ...even the hospital food. Catherine delayed her departure... ...until Vincent left the hospital... ...and went to the seaside to rest. Vincent didn't like the sea... ...but his friends came often. The Saturday that Jack was there... ...Vincent saw how alone Francois was. He learned from Julia... ...that Lucie was no longer "sleeping around". She was falling in love with Jack. She hadn't realized it, nor had Jack, nor Francois. Francois watched them without seeing. He felt Lucie withdrawing in a different way. Instead of wondering "Who?"... ...he wondered "Why?" Vincent was anxious to get back to Paris. It wasn't Catherine he was worried about. She was gone. Nor his work... that was gone, too. He was worried about Jean. He blamed himself for letting Jean accept the match... ...he knew was lost in advance. Many have made it that way. Not like this it's in the gloves. He connected with a hook, It's not enough. He has to attack and attack... One needs the chance to attack. The other one expects it. We've seen Jean attack a few times. Wait, it's not finished. But you've seen Catano before... Have you seen his opponent? Shut up, Paul. Fourth Round. Look, look what he'd done wrong. It's the only way that he can do it. Don't be an idiot, look! Don't hit him with the palm of your hand. Why did he tell him that? Because he hit him in the ear with the palm. I told him not to slug it out with him. Catano is no amateur. Catano also got hurt. Jean recovers fast... Look. Catano's got 17 pounds on him So what? Are you okay? I will be. It's starting to make me sick. That's enough. Look who's talking. Round Five. That one connected. Go get him, Jean! I'm impressed. Now's his chance. In the next round! And to hell with his style! Absolutely. He's hurt. Catano... It's his ear. Round Six. It's over! His ear, I guess. The winner... Jean Lavall?e! By a technical knock-out. I'm not dumb. If it hadn't been for his ear... You won it! Think about your next fight. I don't call it a win! It is! It's the result that counts. Of course I'm glad, but... if we had the same fight 50 times, he'd win. It's never the same fight. That's what he means. I still see Marie. I know, she wrote me. Where's Francois? We'll miss the train. We're leaving. Hurry up. What's wrong? Lucie is leaving. It's over. She's leaving me. She's going with Jack. With Jack. She's moving out tomorrow. They found an apartment on the Left Bank. And the kids? The kids... They'll live with her. What would I do with them, or they with me? I'll see them. Did you talk to Jack? Go ahead. How are you? Fine. Hello, Armand. See you later. Are you taking job? First, I asked Armand because... ...after all, I started in woodwork. - Where are you parked? - Over there. I'm just starting. I get a small commission... ...but I'm doing great. I don't want to brag, but as they say... ..."I've got a future". What's all this about going Bordeaux? It's simple... I've quit boxing. You taught me a trade. Boxing is not a trade. Anyway, not for me. I realized it after... Catano. There's a training school in Bordeaux Six months... then I'll be back. When are you leaving? The 20th... no, the 21st. So is this our last lunch for a while? Then you're paying. Colette must be due pretty soon. I take them for him, not for me. He's got a commission. Just like me. And I ride a bike every morning. Don't try the Tour de France. Only by car. I do it because Lately I've begun to spread a little. Like Colette. Come out to the house for the weekend. I have my son for two days. Bring him along. Maybe I will. Will you call me? Monday, for sure. It's too bad about Marie. She's pretty, young, intelligent. Yes, intelligent. She needs someone her own age. You're asking yourself will he live with her... ...I couldn't. And what if Catherine ever comes back? I'm just talking but one never knows. I said that if Catherine ever came back... One never knows in this life.
