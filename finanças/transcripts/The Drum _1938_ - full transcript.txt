[ Speaking Gaelic] - All right, Captain. -Yes, sir. - Now then. - The murderer who rules Tokot. - Who are you talking about? - The khan, my uncle who killed my father. Very well. Go on. He is going to kill the British Resident. To kill the British Resident — nothing less than that. Well, why should he? To show the peoples of the mountains... that the English are not to be feared anymore. He has invited all the rulers to Tokot to see for themselves. - He sent word? - Yes. - Very secretly, I suppose. - Very secretly. Did he send word to you too? - No. - Then how do you know? The people of Tokot are loyal to me. One of my servants came with the news. And if we send troops to Tokot... they will, of course, acclaim you as rightful heir to the throne. If I wanted that... I would have only to wait until they are killed. I came because I want you to save them. But that would be against your interests, so why should you do that? Captain Carruthers is my friend... and Mrs. Carruthers was very kind to me. Don't you believe me? Do you think I'm a liar? Mrs. Carruthers saved my life. I can't allow her to be killed. Mrs. Carruthers is very dear to me too... but you must understand that I can't just take your word. -You'd be for it? - Eh? He heard me use the expression, sir. Oh. I'd be for it, my lad. We all should. Up and down the line from the viceroy to your friend, the drummer boy. No! I'll send Colonel Adair with you, and we'll send for you if we need you. Then send somebody to Tokot to find me. Hey! Stop! Come back! Come back! -You came on horseback? - Yes, Your Highness. I shall take your horse and leave at once. You too. Get horses from our friends and follow me. -You're not going to Tokot? - Did you tell the government people? Yes, I did... but they didn't believe me. - [ Ra jab] All the better. - [ Wafadar] And it is the will of Allah. - But don't throw away your own life. - Your uncle's got many spies. [ Ra jab] Yes, and he's a cruel man, and he'll get you and kill you. [ Wafadar] That's as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow. We can't allow you to go. Not allow me? When my father was killed, why did you save my life? - Well, because — - Well, because... you're our rightful lord and ruler. If I am your rightful lord and ruler... [ Herrick] I want to speak to the duty officer. [ Man ]I don't care who you're after, you can't come in here. [ Chuckling ] Herrick. It's all right, Corporal. I must get in touch with the governor at once. - What, bad news? - Bad news, very bad news from Tokot. Government House. On the fifth day of the great feast... Captain Carruthers is invited to a banquet at the palace of Ghul Khan. The end of the feast will be a signal for the massacre... and the massacre will be a signal for the uprising of all the mountain states. How soon can a mobile column reach Tokot? Four battalions, mountain battery. And the fifth day of the great feast is only four days off. - When can you start? - Daybreak, Your Excellency. ♪♪ [ Flutes: March] ♪♪ [ Fades] Eh? I managed to refuse the invitation for the whole of the detachment... and I hope that the 250 that remain will look after the 50 that go. Well, it's a wise precaution. Of course, if you'd refused his invitation entirely — - No, I couldn't do that. - No, that would be an insult. Besides, it would give him more food for his propaganda. Huh. Why, he'd be saying next... that the English are too terrified even to eat. [ Laughs] Ah, you know, Carruthers. In the game of international politics... it's the scoundrel who holds all the trumps. - Anyhow, you look after Marjorie, will you? - Of course. Thanks. That's all I wanted to see you about. You're invited to an evening party by the Khan of Tokot... and you're responsible for the good name of the British army. - Have you got that, Kelly? -Yes, Sergeant. Another thing — You won't get any alcoholic liquors. You'll get water, which is good for you. And tea — tea, green and otherwise. So the first man who says, “Mine's a double Bass, miss”... - Do you follow me, Kelly? -Yes, Sergeant. We shall be the guests of a Mohammedan prince... and any nosy parkering... round the harem doors... will be met with severe... and painful punishment. - Got that, Kelly? -Yes, Sergeant. And finally... whatever entertainments are given to you... you've got to be pleased. Whether it's snakes or stomach waggling... I want to see a look of rapture on your faces! Know what a look of rapture is, Kelly? Like what Gunner Wilson had when he strained himself with the howitzer. - [ Men Laughing ] - Silence! Parade! Shun! Thanks. I think you ought to stay here. Mmm. Well, it would be the end of an awfully good tie if we were. - How's that? - Ah, that's fine. No wonder they're gonna make you a colonel. If you think this is a trap, why walk into it with your eyes open? - Do you remember Sir Louis Cavagnari? - Yes. He was British Resident in Kabul. Yes. When was that? - About 60 years ago. - Well, a bit before my time. He was massacred with all his escort, wasn't he? He walked into a trap with his eyes open, and so did Gordon. Yes, but he got out of a good many tight corners... before he was cut down at Khartoum. Exactly, and as a result of that, Kitchener conquered the Sudan... and we've had peace there for two generations. A not-unusual preliminary to our establishing law and order... is the murder of one of our representatives. As one of our representatives, I find you a most exhilarating companion. - Do you know any other funny stories? - Well, I know a happier example. - Do you remember the Chitral campaign in 1857? - Yes. Sir George Robertson, the British Resident, was besieged for months... but he held the residency until the British relief force arrived... and that's why I want you to remain here. Yes. Are you ready? Let's go. I say... are you properly equipped for a ceremonial dinner? 4« [ Men Singing In Native Language ] Okay. Wait downstairs for me, will you? I must see my wife. Right. 23 Singing Continues | Don't, darling. In a few hours, the feast will be over, and everything will be quiet again. But are you quite sure everything will be all right at the palace? Of course. When I accepted the invitation... I made it a condition that the road from the palace should be kept open until I return. And you still don't know what happened to Mohammed Khan? No, but the khan promised I should see him. You'll see. Everything will be fine. Yes. I'll see. All right? Carry on, Sergeant! [ Sergeant Shouting Orders ] - You know your most important order? - Yes, sir. The bugle call.

I will put you in the cage... and it will be carried through all the mountain states... so that the people may know how the English are to be feared. You're a mad dreamer, but you'll wake up one of these days. Before I do, you will write an order, Carruthers — an order to evacuate the residency. - I promise your troops safe conduct. - “Safe conduct.” You swine, you shot at them when they were your guests.
