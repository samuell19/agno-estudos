All the way back... on the right side. - Miss Nakamura, how do you feel? - Good I guess. Will you be all right? All the way in the back. We finally finished all our tests and now... we have to go on this stupid field training trip. This time of the year, Shirakaba Lake is beautiful. Of course, working class people like you never get to visit on summer break. It's one of the best places for boy hunting. So you say... but I know you're still a virgin. I'll see you, I'm taking off. I'm going to hook up with a boy I met at a disco at a place on the way. He's taking me on a road trip. Wait a minute. If the school finds out, you'll be in big trouble. I'd like to give her big trouble. She's given me enough over the past few years. Sounds dangerous ,you'd get expelled for doing that. - Good morning, ma'am. - Morning. - You didn't oversleep today. - That's right. Miss Morita , very sloppy. You're showing your breeding. - Be more careful next time. - Yes. Good morning. - Good morning, students. - Good morning teacher. We are heading to Shirakaba Lake. We will spend two nights and two days at the lake motel. The purpose of this trip is training for a young lady... in etiquette, suitable for participation as a student at White rose. - Alright? - Yes. Now allow me to explain the schedule for the next 3 days. Would you pass these round? - Yes. - Does everybody have the handout? - Yes. Day one - today - we will arrive at the hotel at 5PM. After a freshen-up period, we will have a formal dinner at 6. This was planned by your parents to prepare you girls... for your social debut... WHITE ROSE CAMPUS: THEN...

But it's impossible for just the two of us. So are you a chicken too? Well... I don't want to quit. I'm in. Are you sure the girl will do it? Of course. She arranged for a rest stop here. She was a piece of cake. We definitely need one more. Hey girls! Are you girls on the rag right now? Disgusting! - Your pussy needs cleaning? - Get away you pervert! You're ugly anyway! Hey, young lady! Are you alone? Leave me alone. Who are you waiting for? She's with me. - Who's this? - Who the hell are you? Let's go. Faggot. Piece of shit! Fucking cocksucker! I like women... I like pussy. You want to suck my dick? I like women... Hey old man, you excited? Who the hell are you? Are you making fun of me? Get out! Leave me alone! How would you like to fuck for free? Fuck a woman? This is a fuckin' joke, right? Not at all. Is that true? You're serious? What's wrong Naomi? Naomi! Teacher... Yes? I need to go... to the restroom. Can we make a short stop at the drive-in? Anybody else need to go to the restroom? We wont be stopping again. Driver, will you please? Something?s wrong? He was supposed to be here. I thought you were slipping away with your new boy? I was just joking. Okay? We're leaving. Hurry and board the bus. Hurry. Shut up! Tatsuo? Surprise girlies! Do whatever we ask... or I'll kill you. Who are you? Who are you people? Everybody shut up! This bus belongs to us now. If you don't want to die, obey our orders. You got that? Hey! Close the curtains. Close all curtains... Close them. Do what we're asking. Now! You think we're joking here? Drive. Drive faster! Shut your hole! You?re too loud. Hey, Tatsuo, don't you think your joke has gone too far? What the hell are you saying? Everybody listen to me. Show me your faces. Show me that face. Where are you going? Show me that face. Cute... hold that pose. You like that don't you? Show me... Show me that face. Are you on your period? Show me that face. Show me... How about a kiss? Is that what you like? You have such a cute face... now get naked. Shut up and let me suck those tits. Everybody down. Sit down! - Get off of her! - Damn you! Don't touch my students. Are you alright? Don't cry. Teacher... You are a courageous woman, eh? Show me your face. Nice looking, eh? What kind of people are you? Get off the bus right now! What is your purpose? What is our purpose? Don't worry okay? Everything will be fine if you listen to us, okay? Got it? Will you leave her alone? Don't bother me! Let her go! So... you want trade places with her? - Wha...? - Get undressed! I won't do it. Oh? Then just watch... Stop...please! Stop! Stop it! I understand... I'll do whatever you want. Well, get undressed then. You are a teacher, you understand, don't you? Take it off. Teacher! Let me see those tits! They're so nice, just perfect. It's perfect, like a ripe peach. I'm getting excited. Everybody watch carefully... your teacher is stripping. No! Hey! Look at her. Look... look at her. Teacher... I masturbate a lot, but I haven't had many women. Hey... lay down. Turn your ass over. Hey! Everybody watch this. Open your eyes. Hey! Watch carefully. I bet you never seen this before. Hurry and finish, and get off of the bus! Is everybody watching? You better be watching! That hurt! Leave your scent here... as much as you like. It's funny how bodies react like our minds. When did we become like this? It's still fixable. With just a few words... "I'll go with you". I already made my decision. But why? Why won't you marry me? We could move to America. I like you... I love you. And would like to marry you. But... I have a career. I know we've talked about it so many times. You think that your job as a teacher is as important as my job in the states. It's not fair for me to make such a difficult decision. To choose between you and my career. I'm not asking you to give up your opportunity in America for me... Right? I'm sorry... I have to go. A teacher can't be late for a student trip. Don't go. I am leaving tonight from Narita airport. I have a ticket for you too. Too bad. Too bad? We already decided. All right. I won't say any more. Can I stay here for a while? I want to cherish your scent. Stop the bus. But, what for? Shut up!...just do it! Listen up here! You ugly girls are going to get off at the next stop. Even perverts don't appreciate ugly girls. Raise your hand if you think you're ugly. Did everybody hear that? You there! You can get off. Okay. I'm only interested in girls that I like. Ugly? Nobody's ever called me ugly before. You stay. You get off. And you. Move it! - My bag? - Which one? - That one. - Take it. Hey, after you get off the bus... go to the police... and tell them your bus was high jacked. But you were ugly, so we kicked you off. If you do really go... I don't know what will happen to your friends. Alright? Understand? What's up? I did what you wanted me to do. Now you must leave as promised. Or else, let everybody go. You can keep me as a hostage. This isn't a kidnapping. Then why are you doing this? Get off! Ugly girls move! Off! They'll all be toys for those perverts. We're lucky they think we're ugly. Well... a busload of beautiful girls. Now - everybody get naked and stand up! Stand, come on. Do it! Stand and get naked. Don't fight me... Your turn. Don't give me any trouble. Let me see those tits. Hurry it up! Your ass is wonderful! Are you really in high school? I want to see those titties! Stop fighting it! Look at that! Let's get those panties off! I think I'm in heaven. Help us! Stupid! What are you doing in the middle of the road? - Can you give us a ride? - Please! What's going on? We were kicked off our bus by some perverts who thought we were ugly! - Everybody, get in the back. - Thank you! I will explain everything. Alright. Get in. Everybody. Give me your underwear. You girls looks depressed. Why don't you sing a cheerful song? Huh? Sing! Louder! Sing! Let me see smiles. That's good. Happy. Sing... Hey, your students are behaving. Really? Jacked by three guys? They abused us... scared us... with a hunting rifle. They have guns? They called us ugly... and our teacher got raped in the aisle. Not only the teacher... but other girls did too. They stripped them and raped them. A bus of naked girls? They did it...to most of us. They raped us. They even did it to me. You were raped? I don't know why they are doing this? They need to be stopped! They really did all that? We'll catch them and beat the shit out of them! Let's do this! Get a move on it! Show me... that's a great ass. Not right now. You? very cute. I think I'll have you now. Get down. All pussy should be like this. - Old man! Old man! - What? - Leave her alone. - What? Who's next? Let's see. Show me. I'll pick you. Old man... you're dirty. Can't you clean up first? You're asking too much. Lay down there. Show me your face. Turn around. Why are you... why are you looking at me like that? No - don't do that. I'll do anything besides sex. Uptight bitch! Hey, come here. I want you to... fuck her. Get her wet for me. Naomi, this is awful. Eri, we have no choice. Be mature about this. You're next. Yes, Yes. Isn't this fun? Oh my god, are you okay? Turn around. Look forward. You're next. You look so bored. Don't you show any emotion? Huh? Stupid whore! Off! You're getting off the bus. Help.. Help! Somebody help! You idiot. Somebody almost got killed because of you. You stupid bitch! Enter. Listen up! I'll kill anybody who tries anything stupid. Open. Nobody move! Don't move! Go get some booze. This is our chance. They left him alone here. Can we escape? Do you want to stay here? Why did you stop me earlier? You couldn't have escaped like that. If I hadn't stopped you... someone would have been killed. If I could get the gun, we could get out of this room. I want to go home. I'm scared... I want to get out of here. Everybody, come here. Teacher... Don't worry. Girls, let's go home. I'll get you home safely. Move it! Hurry! Go hurry! Driver! Everybody get back in here! Quickly! Hey! what are you doing? I want to join your gang. That's what. You're accepted. Look at it. Suck on it. That way. There is no escape. Listen, girls... as long as you obey our orders, you will be safe. - Open your legs. - Please, don't. You are all pigs. Brother, that's enough. It's not enough... Yoko's my sister! Yoko tried to commit suicide because of you bitches. Don't tell me you didn't know. RIGHT!? Hey, you know, the first time it's painful. Really? But I heard it depends on the person. That's not what I heard. Quiet, here she comes... the pervert girl. Stop calling her that. Be nice. She sleeps with her brother. - She did? - Don't be so loud. How gross! I can't imagine seeing my brother's face when he cums. Yoko isn't good at socializing. She always stays inside her shell. She was a perfectly timid girl for you girls to bully. - I want to get a good look at her. - Come on! Yoko, what's wrong? Are you alright? Yoko! Hey , what are you hiding? Show us. Your breasts are larger. Show us... Brother... brother... brother... The next day the campus was rife with a rumor... that she was pregnant. That's the reason for her trying to kill herself? Brother, don't talk about it any more. On top of that... you dragged Yoko to a doctor. Was she pregnant? I did what a teacher is supposed to do. The rumor was bad enough... but then they started saying she was forced into having an abortion. It's my fault... that I took her... I'm very sorry. Your apology doesn't mean anything! Brother don't! She tried to help me. I did it... Miss Nakamura, you don't have to say anything. When I... told my brother why I attempted suicide... I put the blame on everyone else... to make myself feel better. But, my lie has caused... all these... terrible things to happen... Stop! Brother, you're afraid of hearing the truth too. I really was pregnant... and I did have an abortion. I told teacher everything. She was very supportive of my problem. Not just as a teacher... but as a woman. That's why I was able to... handle...the abortion. Enough of this shit! If you want to keep talking, leave the room and do it. All this family shit is turning me off! Didn't we come here to fuck? What's this all about, huh? You shut up! Who the hell are you? Everybody move. Stop this! Quiet! Come here. Hey! Yoko! Escape! Yoko get out of here! Stop it, Yoko. Escape! Stop, please! Stop! You don't own me. Hello? Ah... I am from White Rose School. We were supposed to be there yesterday evening. Yes. 35 students and one supervisor. We should be there in one more hour. Yes. Thank you very very much. We ended up taking a detour to see some scenery. Bye. Please start the bus. - Good morning, students. - Morning. Is everybody on the bus? - Yes. Let me go over the schedule again. We are now 15 hours behind... but we'll make up the time.
