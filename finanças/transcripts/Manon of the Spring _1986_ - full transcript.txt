MANON OF THE SPRING Here. Next time I won't pay that much. The competition from Italy is killing me. That barely pays for fertilizer. Next year we'll grow chickpeas. I'll miss having a drink with friends like you. What are you yapping for? What's all the barking about? I won't steal your flock. Leave me my bread! Here, let's share my lunch. What will I eat now? - Gentlemen... - Hello. Bernard, what did you do today? I explored the hills. Look what I found. Lignite. This area is full of it. Very interesting. And I saw some stray goats. The hunchback's daughter's flock. I haven't seen the little savage since her dad died. She hides from us. I've seen her. She's beautiful. Her mother was a real beauty! That hunchback made a lovely daughter. - Who was he? - You didn't know him. It was before you moved here. He was a city intellectual who played at being a farmer. - He was nuts! - He wasn't all that nuts. I don't say he was an idiot. He just wasn't realistic. He tried breeding rabbits by multiplying numbers on paper. Why? Because he had no water! But you found some. Are your carnations doing well? On holidays, mostly Christmas and Mardi Gras. Easter is good, too. And the dead? Are they good business? Not bad. Funerals make good money. Come on! Quick! My darling, Tonight we're playing "Aida" in Bordeaux. I sing a small role, but I'm thrilled. If only you were with me, ί'd be almost happy. Your loving mother. You can't stay here forever. You should go to join your mother. Not a hare, rabbit or partridge. Where have they all gone? Maybe I'm going deaf and blind. Next time I'll bring the baker's dog. That hare won't get away. Galinette! You realize it's five o'clock? That's quite a nap! I think I got sunstroke. No, you're not red. You're probably in need of sleep. Come outside. She can't hear, but she guesses everything. What I have to say concerns only the two of us. Galinette, you're past 30 and you're the last Soubeyran. - I know all that... - Don't interrupt! If I keep saying it, it's your fault. I'll say it until you understand. We Soubeyrans were the region's most important family. - On Grandpa's birthday... - There were 30 of you... All Soubeyrans, with pots of gold hidden throughout the house. Everyone respected us. It didn't last, but don't blame me. It's fate. There's no such thing as fate! Good-for-nothings always blame fate. It was the fault of our elders. Because of pride and greed, they married among themselves. Cousins married cousins. An uncle married his niece. It's bad for rabbits and not good for people. What's the result? Two madwomen and three suicides. Now, there's only us two. I don't count anymore. You're what's left of the Soubeyrans. You want me to marry. Why didn't you take a wife? I wasn't cut out for it. Mind you, I almost did... It didn't work out. I joined the army in Africa on a whim. And when I came back... If there had been a child, I'd gladly have married her. But it didn't happen. I was like Anglade's cherry tree: many blossoms but never any fruit. - So I should marry instead of you? - You have to, Galinette. But why? Why? You're asking me why? What about the Soubeyran fortune? It's not banknotes that rats eat. It's gold! Pots full of gold coins. Understand? And they're mine! That's from saving, skimping and hard work. - You'd throw it all out? - Of course not! I love gold. Then don't leave it without an owner! You can't ask me to start a family just like that. I've asked for ten years! But not as seriously as today. Besides, I have my own ideas. Got someone in mind? Maybe. Won't you tell me who? Listen, I've been in the sun all day and I feel woozy. I'll tell you, but be patient. Fine. I like you, Galinette. Just one more thing... In choosing a wife, think of the children. What do you mean? Don't be beguiled by a pretty face. What we need are wide hips, long legs and nice, big tits! Choose her like a brood mare. What if she's pretty too? If she's pretty too, I won't mind. On the contrary. She'll be the Soubeyran beauty. I'll enjoy looking at her. Come on! Over here, Noé! Come on! Why is it always our turn? The water is for everyone. Cleaning the tank twice a year won't kill you! This red sand and dead leaves... People need clean water. So do vegetables! It's not sticky. It looks like clay, but it's not. It's bauxite powder. A mixture of iron and aluminium. Where can it come from? From the spring, after big storms. It settles here before reaching the fountain. After a rainy night, my spring's water turns red and the stones look rusty. It is rust since it's iron oxide. - Then it can't hurt. - No, it's actually good. Where's your spring in relation to this tank? What do you mean? Is it higher up or below? That's hard to say. The Romarins valley is further up. Then the village water comes from the same valley. Ten o'clock. I promised they'd have water by noon! That's two hours away. But it takes an hour to reach the village. I enjoy your company, but I must report to the mayor. Don't make him wait, teacher! Someone's throwing stones! Wasn't that lightning? You saw lightning? You must have started drinking early. I swear, I drank only coffee this morning. It's my knife! I lost it a few days ago. - Around here? - No. I've never been here before. - That's strange. - The shepherdess returned it to you. Where is she? Which shepherdess? You mean Manon? Yes, the hunchback's kid. Who else? - Is she hiding here? - No, she ran away. Too bad. I wanted to thank her. Some other time! Thank her with a little kiss. I don't know her, but I dreamt of her. In my dream I even kissed her. Did she let you? In my dreams, women don't resist me. - Aren't you eating? - I'm not hungry. You haven't looked well lately. I've lost my appetite, probably from that poison. What poison? The one I spray on my carnations to kill the red spiders. - I'll do it for you. - No. It has to be done at night. Daylight is no good for it. It weakens it. It kills its nastiness. You work nights, but you don't sleep days. You're never home. What do you do all day? I hunt. I walk around on the hills. I breathe in the fresh air... to clean out my lungs from that poison. That's true. It's good for the carnations but bad for you. But you should eat and sleep. - Want a doctor? - No. I'll be all right. See? I'm eating. She's going to Aubagne to sell my thrushes. He's nuts! Who is it? It's me! Yes, you're going nuts! Who is the woman? What woman? The one you visit in Aubagne. I've watched you for days. You keep collecting birds. What for? I see you prancing and talking as if you're nuts! Are you in love? That's a good sickness! So who is she? You won't tell me because you're ashamed. Or she's married. That's it! She's married. She's married! - Open up, idiot! - No, I won't! - We can talk through the door. - Why? If I don't see you, I might tell you. You're as dopey as your poor father. Now, tell me. I don't want to tell you anything. Ask me questions. Tell me who she is. I won't tell you that! - A city girl? - Quite the opposite! Good! Do I know her? - Actually, no. - What does that mean? You're too clever. After four questions, you'll know. Then I do know her. See? I don't want to tell you. You act like a cop, but I won't tell you. Why not? Because! It's my secret. My first secret love. And I'm keeping it. Keep it! I'm leaving. Goodbye! No! Stay! I want to talk about her. I don't even know who she is. But I do, so I like talking about her. Papet, have you gone? No, I'm rolling a cigarette. So, you want to marry her? Yes, but she won't have me. - Why? - She's pretty and I'm ugly. Does she have property? Not much. Is she healthy? Yes, she's strong as a horse and has good little muscles. She would do a better job on my carnations than me. - And she's educated, too. - How do you know? She's always reading books. Sometimes for a whole hour. That's no good. A poor girl who reads books. I don't like it. Besides, a beautiful wife could mean trouble. Is she honest? She's the holy virgin of the hills. If she'd marry me, she'd be a wonderful wife. I'd be happy as a king. But she won't. No poor girl ever rejected a Soubeyran... Unless she's crazy. If she said yes, would you consent? I can't until I know who she is. You idiot! Open up and tell me! I won't open the door! I have to think! Papet... I may tell you, but first, swear by all the Soubeyrans that when you hear her name you won't say a word. - As you like. - No! Swear it! I swear by all the Soubeyrans. Good. Now I have to decide. I'm not opening the door. I'm removing the key. Put your ear next to the keyhole. It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter. Twenty years from now, you'll be too old for her. She'll have lovers. She wouldn't do that. She's like all the others. But never mind. By then you'll have a house full of sturdy Soubeyrans since she's pretty. I give my consent. - You've seen her? - Yes, I have. - What's your opinion? - She's very pretty. She seems mature for her age. She looks 18 at least. - Know who she's like? - Nobody. She looks like someone you never knew. She looks exactly like her grandmother. You knew her grandmother? Florette Camoins... The beauty. Miss, I'm glad to meet you. I wanted to thank you for my knife. How did you know it was mine? I saw you eating with it. I'm the new teacher. I'm collecting minerals in the hills to teach my pupils the composition of their land. I thought you were a prospector. It's Jurassic Cretaceous from the second Quaternary. You know a lot for a shepherdess. I'm just quoting my father. - I'd like you to keep this. - I have one. That's too fancy for me. No. A shepherdess should have a shepherd's knife. It has four blades, an awl and a nail file. And scissors. I know, because I used it. It's the first one I've snared. It's a baby. The big ones get away. That hare is my present to you. My class starts soon. I have to go. I'll leave this on a rock. Someone is bound to find it. She doesn't want your knife. - I'll keep it if you take the hare. - All right. Thank you. Papet... How do you talk to girls? I don't know any words of love. So, you've made up your mind? Yes. I must hurry. She could meet a man in Aubagne who might take her from me. - Where will you court her? - In the hills. I'll pretend to look for snails or mushrooms as if I hadn't seen her. Not so fast... If you're looking for mushrooms or snails, it makes you seem poor. If you're rich, show it. Don't wear your old clothes. Wear a new suit, a real hunting outfit with leather leggings and a matching hat. And above all... wear braces! Excuse me... I'm looking for a hare I shot that must be wounded. Aren't you Manon, poor Monsieur Jean's daughter? I see you don't remember me. That's because I've changed a lot. I'm Ugolin... Your poor father's friend. You've changed, too. You're a real young lady. I hardly recognized you. You may wonder why we never met before. I'm too busy to hunt because of my carnations. Did you know I grew carnations? I've been very successful. I've earned lots of money. The money's all in gold coins! In two years, with my savings, I'll have 50,000 francs. Would you like to move back to Romarins? I'd stay in my house in Massacan and you and Baptistine can tend my carnations. Manon, listen to me! I know why you don't want to. It's because you're proud. But your pride is no problem. Carnations need watering, picking, and women know all about that. I'll pay you! I'll pay you very well! It isn't to have you work. I was lying. I love you. I love you with all my heart! Manon! I want to marry you! I'm all alone! I have no one! My grandfather is dead. My grandmother is dead. My father hanged himself. My mother died of the flu. There's only Papet left! He's rich, he's old. He's going to croak! He'll leave it all to me and it'll be yours. Because I love you! I love you! I love you! My love for you is choking me, making me ill. I saw you bathing in the water holes. I watched for ages. You were so beautiful. I was afraid I'd commit a crime! - You spoke to her? - I didn't see her. - She must have gone to Aubagne. - Then do it tomorrow. Maybe. I have to get used to this outfit first. You look great! Like a hunter from Marseilles. - Look! Do you see what I see? - A beautiful thrush. It must be the hunchback's daughter's trap. - Are you sure? - Yes. That's her flock. She must be around here. Other people's traps are sacred. I won't touch it. Especially hers. It's her only livelihood. She sells them at Aubagne market. She's proud. We've hurt her enough. We didn't mean to, so we're not responsible. We're all responsible. We knew about the Romarins spring, but we said nothing. - Why didn't you speak up? - Because of Amélie. - Want a bite to eat? - You bet I do. When I used to hunt at Romarins, I'd see that poor hunchback with his divining rod. Once, he was right above it but the rod didn't bend. Then he dug in the wrong place. That night I was upset, so I told Amélie. What a scene! She flew into a rage! It was none of our business. Hunchbacks are bad luck. He was an outsider, from Crespin, etc., etc. You know how she is. She made me swear to say nothing. - So you didn't? - No. Ugolin and Papet are real bastards. In that business, we were all bastards! - Papet, my spring's dried up! - What? - No water! - None at all? No, I dug down deep. Not a drop! - The carnations are budding! - 15,000. - Your cistern? - It will be empty in two days! Springs are erratic. Especially his. Give it three months. Three months! Holy Mother... Stop it, you fool! Get up! The water is probably back by now. And if not, with a few mules, we can hold out. It used to flow. When the hunchback came, it stopped... Something's wrong with the fountain. It's just trickling. - Come and see. - That's not possible! - Here, too? Papet, we're ruined! - Calm down! Well? Must be a frog or a snake inside. We can't end up like Ugolin. Impossible! It hasn't stopped running in 50 years. I'll check on the tank. Nothing. - Off I go. - Don't panic. Monsieur Jean, have mercy. You're up in Heaven. You can see my feet are so swollen that I can't wear shoes, that my mule is half-dead. If this continues, my carnations will be ruined in 8 days. Come on, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, give us back your daughter's spring. Amen. Help us! Amen, God damn it! Yes, this is the mayor. When'll he get here? Tomorrow? We'll be dead! He must come right away! We have no bread! Our crops are ruined! It's a disaster! Then I'll expect him tomorrow at the town hall. - The expert is coming tomorrow. - What expert? The one I keep asking for. The rural engineering expert. The meeting will come to order. This council meeting concerns the water problem. Problem? It's a disaster! That's right, a disaster. But thanks to my own efforts and my telephone, I was able to get us a rural engineer. And here is the rural engineer. Gentlemen, I've studied your problem and here's the report I'm submitting to my chief. The "Partridge Spring' that fed your fountain was the main water source for the whole region. It flowed from a crevice between two layers of limestone. It is not diaclistic. It's a Vauclusian resurgence. Let's not confuse the two. Thus, the water table between two impervious strata levelled out and the water issued from the upper stratum, under pressure. This trapped pool supplied your tank and the tank fed your fountain via a series of pipes through gravity. It's grave all right! At the request of your mayor and the administration, we sought the cause of this terrible accident. First, where did your water originate? Luckily we have this document. Very interesting! This study by the chief engineer describes, clearly and precisely, experiments made in this region five years ago. Unfortunately, your spring does not appear on this valuable map. It isn't part of the orography of the River Huveaune. Where does that leave us? The water has to come from further away. - I want to speak. - Not now! I'll make it short. Just let him turn on the water. He can explain later! I don't fix fountains. The first hypothesis is the drought. A small drop in the water table may have caused your problem. As the rising water is diverted by dolomite and Jurassic rock, it must get through via siphons. You know what a siphon is? A rubber tube to draw wine. Exactly. At the first rain, the siphons will be re-primed as soon as the underground lake rises to its normal level. - An underground lake? - Of course! Progress has its advantages. If progress returns my water, I'm for it. If my spring flows again, here's 100 francs for progress! Wait and listen... to the rest of this bullshit! The second hypothesis... The underground stream dropped into a network of caves. Once they're filled, the water will feed the spring again. When? I can't tell you how long it might take. Maybe two days... maybe two years. Maybe 100 years! That can't be ruled out. Third hypothesis... To hell with your hypotheses! What can you do for us? The authorities will provide a daily truck with 1,300 gallons of water. It will cover your immediate needs. How much water do I get for my carnations? If our water isn't back in a month, what then? We suggest you farm elsewhere. What can I say? Lots of villages have plenty of water. The council can't accept that! Your council's power over natural phenomena is close to zero. The third hypothesis... To hell with their hypotheticals! A fine administration we have! Well, the administration says to hell with you! Just make do with the water truck. It will be here in two days. Ladies and gentlemen, goodbye. Where is he? Where's the chairman of the Water Syndicate? Who's the chairman? It's not me! It's you! Because I'm the mayor and that's because I have a phone. So what's this? Your receipt. Right. 52 francs plus the stamp. You took my money, so where's my water? The expert just explained about the orography. Yes, the orography matters. I don't give a damn about all that! - I want my water! - Listen... They're sending a water truck every day. Bring your mule, two barrels and you'll get 40 gallons of water like the rest of us. One: I have no mule, just a donkey. Two: 40 gallons will do for a café, not for a field. Three: I paid for spring water, not truck water. It'll be spring water. Not from my spring! I paid and I want my water! Stop yelling! You're wearing us out and it won't help. Holy Mother! My poor eggplants! My 600 beef tomato plants! Everyone is affected. It's a major disaster. Major, hell! I paid and I want my water! The spring has dried up! Where can we find water? Who cares? Just make it run from my pipe. And you, stay out of it! You're a councilman, but I didn't vote for you. I don't need your vote! You pain in the ass! Where do you think you are? Surrounded by water thieves! Stop! Stop it! Good morning. Today is my birthday. After Mass, you're all invited for a drink. We don't pick the day we're born. My brothers, I am truly glad. Truly glad to see you all gathered in our little church. The whole parish is here, including a group of fine thinkers who usually observe Holy Mass on a café terrace. I won't name it: it's our only café. I won't name them either. You're all looking at them. That should fill them with shame, were it not for their cynicism. With clasped hands and moist eyes, you're full of faith and repentance today. But God knows that you're here because your spring dried up and your prayers are merely pleas for your string beans, entreaties for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your tubers, hosannas for your squash! I must speak seriously about the spring. I keep asking myself the same question: why is it that this water, so plentiful until now, has suddenly dried up in our hour of need? I once read in a secular work, a Greek tragedy, about the city of Thebes, struck by a violent plague because of its king's crimes. So I ask myself: "Is there a criminal among us?" It's not impossible, since the worst crimes often escape human justice. But God knows all about them! I'll now speak to this unknown criminal, if he exists. To him I say: My brother, there is no sin that cannot be forgiven, no crime that can't be atoned for by sincere repentance. Our Lord, Jesus Christ, said these surprising words: "One repentant sinner is more welcome in Heaven than 100 just men." Whatever your offence, try to make amends. Repent and you shall be saved! And our spring will flow better than before. - Papet... - Yes? He knows. He looked at me three times. What could he know? He's only been here for a year. Maybe somebody told him in confession. Anglade might have. He's such a bigot he could confess other people's sins. - What worries me is the girl. - Me too. She gave you a mean look. She looked at me twice. She seemed to say, "You're the criminal." - She knows nothing either. - So what worries you? I don't think she'll want you. Happy birthday! Happy birthday! To our teacher's good health. What did you think of the sermon? What do you expect? It's just a lot of words. I don't think an act of God dried up the spring. The priest seems to know of a crime. Maybe he heard it in confession and couldn't say more. What crime? If anyone here committed a crime, we'd all know. I think he had someone in mind. - Then who? - Who? He kept looking at Ugolin. Especially when he spoke of the plague. I'm a plague? Don't joke about such things. You smelled the pastis! I'm here about the water, not the pastis. I have to speak to you. It's very important. - To me? - Yes. You can bring our water back. I can? How? By coming to the procession. Will you? Then our fountain will never flow again. You think she's a saint? An orphan's prayer soars to Heaven like a lark. Our Lord will listen to her song. She's innocent. If she prays for us, we're saved. Manon, you must save our carnations! I won't help those who stole my father's water! I don't understand. They understand. They know why God is punishing them. Tell us. Do you know who the criminal is? There are two of them. Here they are. I'd rather go home than be called a criminal. Come, Galinette. Your hurried departure might make us think... I don't care what you think! My conscience is clear. Let's go! - Coming? - No. I want to hear what she's accusing me of because I can solve the whole problem. How did they steal your father's water? She's imagining things! It's true her father's lack of water may have ruined him. He would have found water, but he had that fatal accident. The two women were in trouble, so we bought the small farm. Partly because we liked it, true, but also to help them out. Later we searched for the spring, and, by sheer luck, found it. That's what she calls stealing his water! "Help thy neighbour"... some joke! Let's go. He's lying! The truth is the spring was always there. The truth is you blocked it up. - Why would they do that? - To buy it cheap. Without water, it was worthless! My father's dead because of them. That's not true! It's slander! I found the spring with my watch. You were there, with your mother. - Tell the truth! - In less than an hour? The spring could've said like God to Pascal: "You wouldn't look for me unless you'd already found me." To hell with Pascal! I only met him once. He was so rude I slapped him! Go on, laugh. But it's true! Here's what we have... She denies what she saw, but believes what she didn't see. Who saw us block up that spring? Who saw us block it up? I saw you. I saw you both. Liar! What did you see, idiot? You never knew left from right! In the army, they had to mark each hand! He never understood, so they sent him home. I planned it that way! It was hard, but it worked. The major was suspicious... We're not interested in that. Tell us what you saw. He saw nothing. He was dreaming! I never dream! It was nine or ten years ago. - See? He's being vague. - It was after Bouffigue died. I was at Romarins, hunting. Partridge drank from a puddle near the empty farmhouse, I picked the lock... Very nice! Breaking into a dead man's house! Bouffigue put in two attic windows to shoot thrush. - First, I took a nap. - You see, he slept. He was dreaming. It was no dream! All of a sudden, the sound of a pickaxe woke me up. Through the windows, I saw him digging while the other watched. I didn't dare move. The water gushed from the hole, but they blocked it with cement! Why didn't you tell her father? It wasn't my business. But now God is punishing them, and us. It's my business now! Let's imagine he's telling the truth... It's not true, but if it were... I'm willing to give her the spring, the carnations, the farm, the gold, the Soubeyran fortune, my life. You know that. I told you so in the hills. I love you more than anything. Listen... Listen to me, Manon. I see you and talk to you constantly. My food has lost its taste, sleep has been a torment... If you don't want me, I'll die or go crazy. Shut up, idiot. Let's go. Just think about it. What a thrilling mixture... My remorse for the harm I've done and the joy I can bring you. Don't you know how I'll slave for you, my love? Make him go! Don't be a fool! Get up! Think, Manon! Just think. My love will kill me and nobody will care! Galinette, come on home! No! It's all your fault! I lost everything because of you! If I'd known. Galinette, my boy! I'll stay. Since you're all against him, I'll defend him. That won't be easy. You know there was never a spring at Romarins, just a puddle. But I found the real spring! Those of you born here like me, admit there was no spring. Listen carefully. If you knew there was one and didn't tell the hunchback, then you're to blame for his death. - The old bastard! - You knew? Of course. We all knew. But we didn't dare denounce them to defend an outsider. They hated my grandmother, so took it out on her son. Who's your grandmother? Florette. They never forgave her for marrying a man from Crespin. Florette was your grandmother? The hunchback was Florette's son? Papet wants to see you and the mayor. Papet wants to see you. - You, too. - Me? He said to hurry. He said you'll be glad. - Where is he? - At Romarins, waiting for you. What's wrong? Put him on the table. Put him here. Go to the village. Tell the deaf one to bring candles from the church. At least six big ones. And the linen sheet his grandmother wove. Pamphile, prepare the box. There are oak boards in the attic. The ones I'd set by for myself. I know. You're the one who ordered them. Use them for him. The rest of you, please, say he fell from a tree. Keep this a secret for three days until he's buried. Or the priest won't give him a proper funeral. Go now. - I'll stay with you. - There's no need. She could have married him anyhow and had her revenge by driving him crazy. Papet, I'm leaving because ί can't go on. It's not the carnations, it's because of my love. I realize she'll never want me. I suspected it because her ribbon caused an abscess. And when I told her in public I wanted to marry her, she spat at me in rage. What's more, she fled towards the teacher. When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes. When he stops, she can't wait for him to go on. And he takes her love for granted. He's unaware of his happiness, but ί know my misery. I can't stand it, I'd like to kill him. But that would hurt her, and I'd never hurt her. I leave her my farm and all that's hidden, you know what I mean, to the left of the fireplace. Don't make any trouble. It's not her fault or yours. It's fate. Have a Mass said for me. Up there, I'll need to explain about the spring. Adieu, my Papet. I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't stay. You know? I know. What will you do? I don't know. We won't go back to that house. Too many bad memories. I'd see him hanging where my swing used to be. And smell his odour in the house. Will you join the procession? If you're convinced that the water won't come back, you should go. If your father could bring back their spring, what would he do? He'd have liked to be their friend. For his sake, do what he would have done. You think this procession will help? You never know. I wonder how I'd feel if their prayers brought the water back. I would feel obliged to go to confession. That's what worries me. I know several fools who'd think like you and I'd surely lose the elections. Miracles can be very convincing. Something's happening. Stop! It's gurgling. The pipe's murmuring. A miracle! Kneel! Kneel, everybody! It's not a miracle! It's just a coincidence. I recognized your step. Your ear is as sharp as an eye. Ears can't replace eyes, César. No, they can't replace them. Belly dancing is all very well, but you did a stupid thing over in Africa. I did? I said a stupid thing, but it was almost a crime. I don't know what stupid thing you mean. When I got wounded, I was about to be promoted. I don't mean that. I'm talking about a letter you received. What letter? One that deserved an answer... An answer that you never wrote. A letter from whom? You don't want to say it because you think I don't know. - I swear, Delphine. - Don't swear, you sinner! I'm sorry for reminding you of something unpleasant. Unpleasant? From here, I see the church and the cross of the steeple. I swear on that cross that I received no letter. Except from my father and Anglade. In that case, it's a tragedy. Why? Swear again that you're not lying to me. I swear it. Who wrote to me? Florette. Florette Camoins? There was no other Florette. Are you sure? I gave the letter to the postman myself. I'd never have forgotten a letter from her. I still have two faded notes she wrote me... and the comb from her hair. It's true. When I came back, she'd left the village. She was married to the blacksmith in Crespin. And she already had a child. How could that letter have been lost? Over there, we moved from place to place. Sometimes our food and ammunition didn't reach us. Some letters may have been lost too. But if I had received that letter, I would still know it by heart. If that's true, it's dreadful! - You think she loved me? - You old fool! She never told me so. Not even after what happened between us one night, in Anglade's barn. That's how she was. In her letter, she told you she was pregnant. What? Yes. You had left three weeks before. She told you if you wrote to her father, promising to marry her, she would wait for you. She could have shown your letter to the whole village, so no one would have dared to make fun of her. Are you sure? The poor girl couldn't sleep. She tried to get rid of the baby with diabolic potions. She jumped from rocks in the hills. But the child held on. Then she started hating you. She went to a dance in Aubagne, where she met the blacksmith from Crespin. So she left the village and no one ever knew when the child was born. Was it born alive? Yes. Alive. But a hunchback. I hear Clairette coming back. Come on over, my girl. It's getting chilly. I'd rather sit by the fireside. Adieu, César. Don't worry. I never told anyone. I'm going to pray for you. What's wrong, Papet? Are you ill? Don't stay out here. - Shall I call a doctor? - No. I could call to Ombrées. No, thank you. I know what's wrong with me. Lean on me. I'll walk you home. My friend, I don't believe you're about to die. But I believe I am. I know I'll die tonight. What makes you think so? I'll die because I no longer want to live. Hurry and confess me. You'll see, I have a lot to say. You know that suicide is a mortal sin. I won't need to kill myself. I'll simply pass away. Dear God, please don't let her baby be a hunchback. Dear little Manon, the notary will tell you that I'm leaving you my whole estate. It may surprise you, but it's the truth. The notary will give you all the documents... because your father was my son. He was the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life... whom ί let die little by little because I didn't know who he was. If I had told him about the spring, he'd still be playing his harmonica and you'd all be living in our family home. No one knows about it, but I'm too ashamed to face anyone. Even the trees. In the village, only one person knows. She'll tell you everything. ίt's Delphine, the old blind woman. She'll explain that it's all because of Africa. I don't deserve to kiss you and I've never dared to speak to you, but maybe now you can forgive me and even say a little prayer for poor Ugolin... and poor old me. I even pity myself. Out of sheer spite, I never went near him. I never knew his voice, or his face. I never saw his eyes, that might have been like his mother's. I only saw his hump and the pain I caused him. Now you understand why ί want to die. Because next to my torments, even hell would be a pleasure. Besides, I'll see him up there. I'm not afraid of him. Now he knows he's a Soubeyran, I can't be blamed for him being a hunchback. He understands it was all a foolish mistake. I'm sure that instead of accusing me, he'll defend me. Adieu, my darling girl. Your grandfather, César Soubeyran. Subtitling: HIVENTY
