(Latin music) (marimba music) (inspirational music) - It came suddenly and without warning. The great ice storm that turned the city into a fairy land of light. (police car siren) The next morning even the poorest neighborhood sparkled. Three-foot icicles clung like stalactites to street lamps and telephone poles. Trees shimmered as if strung with diamonds. And the air was ablaze with colliding rainbows. Since neither snow nor ice had been seen in the city for years, the day seemed destined to be special. (upbeat music) - Oh my. Wade, get up. - Is it time for school already? - No but you gotta see something! - Look, ice swords! They're hanging everywhere. I can' wait to get my hands on one. - Don't you wish it could stay like this all winter? It's so beautiful. Nothing seems the way it really is. (upbeat music) - I'm gonna be home late today mama. I'm gonna go sword fighting after school! Oh oh, I didn't know it was full! - Wade! Selena look at your blouse, that stain will never come out. Why can't you be more careful! - Mama, can I go walking with the other girls today? It's so beautiful out. - I'm sorry Selena, but you know I count on you to help with the house work. The beds need to be made, there's the laundry, the ironing, the vacuuming. And I'm gonna work late tonight so be sure to get supper started. But honey, no more of your pea soup. Promise? - Yes mama. (dramatic music) (kids yelling) - Go Wade go! - Go the distance man! - Ha ha ha! - Nice one man. - Real cool. - Ow! (kids laughing) - Oh! - Oh excuse me. - Ha ha ha! (kids laughing) - Oh, lordy. What a mess. And now I've hurt you. - Don't worry, I'm ok. How are you? Here, let me help you up. - Come on Wade, let's get out of here! - There now, are you ok? - Oh my, you're a strong little girl. And a very good one too. Thank you child. - Oh I'm sorry, it was an accident. Do you live very far from here? Maybe I should carry these home for you. - Oh why bless you girl. And I'd be very grateful to you. No, it's not very far. - Selena, where are you going! Mama will be mad at you. - I'll be home soon. - Forget her Wade, let's go. (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] At the bridge, the old woman stopped and pointed to a stairwell that led to the tracks below. - Down there? But, but it must be hard for you climbing these steps all the time. - Oh, I manage most of the time. But today, I admit it's a problem. - You live here? - Yes child. - But, - You never know what sort of place might turn out to be home, do you? The main thing is to make it as clean and as cozy as you can. (piano music) Come in to my parlor. - Oh but inside it's so nice and roomy. Not at all what I expected. It's like no place I've ever seen. - And why should it be? If you go around thinking everything is the way you think it is, well ma'am, (laughs), you're gonna be in for a lot of surprises! Oh my poor Tater. Look here, I brought us some nice bones for our supper. Course I wouldn't have made it home at all if it weren't for this nice little girl. Selena, isn't that what the boy called you? - Yes that's right. - Let's see, we'll need some salt, some rosemary, and Tabasco. Yes lots of Tabasco! - Poor woman. She has nothing to eat but those bare bones. - You've been so nice to me Selena. Please stay for supper. - Oh thank you but I really ought to be getting home. - You'll be home early enough, supper will be ready in no time. - Well I suppose I - Good, now that that's settled, I'm gonna rest my feet a bit. Selena when that pot starts to boil, would you throw in those old bones? Soon we'll have us a nice stew. - [Voiceover] The old woman caught the look of disbelief on Selena's face and knew what she was thinking. "How could bones without a scrap of meat on them make a nice stew?" - At home, I always make supper. Well almost always. (country music) - Yuck. (coughs) - Selena, what have you put in this pea soup? There must be a half pound of pepper in it. Wade, don't take another mouth full or you'll be sick. - Poor child. You do all you're asked to and more. The best way you can. And where's the appreciation? How's our supper coming along? Can you give the pot a stir? - [Voiceover] Selena did as she was asked. To her surprise the most delicious fragrance filled the air. She couldn't believe it. There really was a stew cooking, though all she could see was water and bones. - It smells wonderful. - Mmm that it does. - [Voiceover] Selena and the old woman were soon sharing a feast. Though where it came from was hard to say. - Shall we have some dinner music? - Oh yes. (calypso music) - * Things aren't what they seem * Life is sometimes like a dream * Sing, dance, join the band * And take a hand * Don't be surprised to find * You're no longer blue * When the music starts to play * Hope comes shining through, yeah * Oh * You gotta dance with me yeah * Yeah you gotta sing you gotta sing, oh * Yeah you gotta dance with me yeah * Don't be surprised to find, you're a different you * When your eyes believe your heart * Wishes can come true * Things aren't what they seem * Magic lurks in everything * You got to sing you got to dance you got to join the band * You gotta take a hand * Don't be surprised to learn that everything can change * That's what makes this life of ours * That's what makes this life of ours * That's what makes this life of ours * So wonderful and strange - [Voiceover] That afternoon Selena talked and talked, pouring forth her problems. Before the old woman, she opened up like a flower to the light. - Selena, it's time you figured out what you want your future to look like. You won't always be keeping house for your mother and brother. You've got to start making plans now. You can transform yourself, be anything you want to be. It takes work and determination, but you can do it. (audience cheering) - Oh it's late. I have to be getting home. - I know. But before you go, I'd like you to have something to remember me by. Tell you what, go to the little fridge in the back. There's some eggs in there. Some will be crying, "take me take me". Others will be crying, "don't take me." Help yourself to those that want to go. (eggs yelling) - [Voiceover] There was a great clamor among the eggs. Selena was careful to remove only those that begged to go. Not wishing to be greedy, she took only three. (fire crackling) It was a chill twilight. Everywhere things seemed to be encased in glass. The temperature had dropped and ice shapes now glittered, ghost like. - Mama will have a fit if supper's not ready. I know, I'll make an omelet with these eggs. Still have to hurry though. (upbeat music) (car horn) (eggs yelling) Oh, they're goes the omelet. What's this? The egg is changing into something else. It's the pot that played music for us. This one is changing too. (inspirational music) (cranking sound) And what will you become? Ha ha, it's me dancing. Perhaps the old woman is right. Things can change. - [Voiceover] That evening, Selena told about her visit to the old woman's house, and showed her family the surprise gifts. (piano music) - These are neat. (cranking sound) - These diamonds are real. If we sold this broach, we could buy a house of our own. - Mama, I don't want to sell it. - Of course we have to sell it. How else are we going to pay for your new glasses. And there's 100 other things we could use. Selena, you've got to ask that old lady for more of those chatty eggs. - Mama, I don't think I could go back and ask her for more presents. - Oh Selena, why are you such a difficult child. (crying) - Real cool. - I didn't... - Mama, are you alright? - Wade, what am I supposed to do? Here this could be our one chance to get on top of things. - I'll do it for you mama. - You will? (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] The next day after school, Wade went to the bridge that overlooked the railroad tracks. (upbeat music) - Wade are you home? - Selena? Your brother's not here. He's gone to get us those talking eggs. (knocking) (dramatic music) - Hello, is anyone home? (dramatic music) - Can I help you? - I'm Wade, Selena's brother. - Oh. - What a weird looking house. (dog growling) - Ha ha, ugly old dog. I'm starving. Selena said when she came here, she ate and ate til she nearly burst. Can you make me a big meal too? (dog growls) Well, how about an omelet then? I'm sure you got some eggs here. - No, son, don't. You'll be... Don't steal those eggs. You'll be sorry. (eggs yelling) - Yo, who's saying what? Oh who cares. I'll just take you and you and you. (upbeat music) - Oh! (theatrical music) - Hey what's going on? What is this stuff? It's pea soup. I hate pea soup! (dramatic music) That was close. I almost drowned in that soup. Oh man. (dramatic music) Ah! Selena! Watch out! No, don't hurt her. She's my sister. Please, she didn't do any harm. I stole the old lady's eggs. I'll give you anything you want, just don't eat my sister. - Who's planning to eat her? - Please, she didn't do any harm. I stole the old lady's eggs. I didn't really want to do it. It was wrong even though I did it for mama. - I don't wanna eat either of you. But hand over that egg. It doesn't belong to you. - I'll find a way to make it up to the old lady. I promise. (dramatic music) Whoa! (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] That night, Wade told Selena about how he had tried to get more talking eggs. - That poor old woman Wade. We have to go back tomorrow and make sure she's alright. - How about we take her some egg salad sandwiches. - Oh, egg salad huh? Sounds good. I'll make it for you. Wade, you know you shouldn't be sitting on the bed. - Ha ha. - [Voiceover] The next day, brother and sister returned to the railroad yard. But to their great surprise, there was no sign of the old woman, or the strange little house she had made her home. - Where did she go? - I don't know Wade. - Selena, I'm sorry I always get you in trouble. - Wade, I am going to be a dancer. - You are? A dancer? - I'll show you. (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] Together the children danced their way home. (upbeat music) The ice had melted. The snow was gone. There was even a hint of Spring time in the air. (upbeat music)
