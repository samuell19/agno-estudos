Save that for Toni. Well remember it's your loss. Where is she? I don't know, I've got enough to worry about looking after little me. Ah no anytime you want looking after. May I have the pleasure. Sorry. Well you're a dance hostess aren't you. So what? Well this is an excuse me. I'm tired. You heard what the young lady said didn't you? Okay, sorry I spoke you see what I mean. Come on you stepped right in. No I think it's the gypsy in me, or is it the Irish? I'd say it was the scotch. Ah excuse me. Do you like this old job? I'd like it alright, if men didn't talk so much. Oh. Hello gorgeous. You can save it for Annette. I'd save it if you prefer tried it on Peggy? What's the matter, you tired? That fellas beat. Gosh you outta use him for building roads. You need a rest darling. What do you say to a trip to Brighton. You're always wanting to take girls to Brighton. What's so special about Brighton? I suppose baker makes it monte Carlo. Anywhere with Paul baker is okay with me. You want your head examined. I have. They sent it back with a note saying, contents missing. Is Gregory in? I hear he's waiting for you. The way I figure it he probably is. May I? Get out of it. Listen Dave, I want to talk to you, give you a bit of advice. What's this a lecture? Maybe. Dave you talk too much. I suppose that's bakers idea. Don't keep on about baker. Or Gregory's maybe. Listen. I think I'll go and have a talk with Mr. Gregory. Everything arranged for Friday? Yes I'll have a final checkup with that fellow on the inside. Look g, Dave Robinson... You clear about Friday's job pogson? I think so Mr. Gregory. You? Okay with me Mr. Gregory. Alright. No slip up mind. G, Dave Robinson. My ears are burning something terrible. Come in Dave. I'm in. Want to talk to Dave alone g? Yes please Paul. Does he use perfume? No I don't think so. Well he ought to. Ah it's a prize giving I see. Yes Dave, and I see by your letter you want your share of the ludgood hill affair. That's the general idea. Alright. Afraid it wasn't as good a proposition as we'd expected. Oh, how's that Mr. Gregory? A lot of the staff's phony. That's a bit strange innit? Paper said it was a 50,000 quid job. People who read newspapers aren't interested in anything under that amount. Now your share Dave comes to 50 pounds exactly. 50 pounds. What do you think I am, a mug? That is a matter of opinion. A lot of the stuff isn't worth breaking up. Fancy that now. Seems a pity we went to all that trouble doesn't it. It's a pity you hit that watchman so hard, I hear he has a fractured skull. Ah don't give me that, I know what I did. You're inclined to allow your enthusiasm to run away with you Dave. 50 pounds exactly. That's no good to me and you know it. I don't take chances for that sort of money. I'm sorry Dave, take it or leave it. There are others besides you in this you know. Don't I know it. What about him, all he had to do was to walk in and help himself after I opened the place up. Is his cut the same as mine? That's my business, and don't come so close to me, I'm a little fastidious. Is that so? I'll come as close to you as I like. Not too close if you don't mind. Well well. What do you think you're gonna do with that thing? It's for you to do the thinking Dave. You wouldn't you know, you ain't got the guts. I'll show you if you come here. Stop it, stop it. As I'm working overtime, I might as well be paid for it. Don't be crazy Dave. Hey! Let me go. I know what I'm doing. Evening officer. Ah good evening Mr. Baker. Nice tonight. Yes, I've just come out for a minute, it gets warm inside. Hey must do. It's stuffy I'd say. Yeah. Cigarette? Oh no sir, not when I'm on duty thank you. No of course not. Supposed I better get back. Very good sir. Goodnight good night Mr. Baker. Hello pop how are ya? Hey I'm fine. Here he is miss, right on the dot. Okay joy goodnight. Bye. Trust Ted. I think they taught him that habit in the army. Ay, well go straight home now. We're going out to supper, I've hit a stroke of luck. Oh. No it's alright love, I'll tell you about it later. Come on. Good night pop. Good night to ya both. It's Dave. Is he dead? How did this happen? I wish I knew. Don't crowd around now, come on. Could I use a phone please? Why do people have to get murdered when I'm out with my wife for the first time for years? Spite sir I shouldn't wonder. Is Benson back yet? No sir, but he won't be long. Will you see the taxi driver now? Yes and I'll see the girl at the same time. Oh very good sir. Chair please. Come in you two, sorry for the delay, but there are usually one or two things to do when there's a murderjob you know. Well I've read your statements and there are one or two points in which I think you might be able to help. Alright sit down. You and Robinson were friends weren't you? Yes sir, we were kids together. We lived on the same street, all three of us. Winston street, camelwood green. Yes sir. Joined up together didn't you? They volunteered. When did you last see Robinson? Tonight sir, we met him for a drink at the pelican club off shoshby Avenue, he was a member. Drinks are pretty expensive there, you must've been in the money. Dave was never hard up. Oh he could think of more ways to earn a couple of bone. Civy straight seems pretty strange to some of the boys. Yes sir. When they come out, they don't know what to do. Well that's right, it isn't only that. The job you did before the war seems sort of small after six years. Besides, it costs so much more to live now. And Robinson couldn't wait to save the hard way eh? No sir, whatever old Dave wanted, he had to have and he usually got it too. Quite. Robinson didn't show you or offer you any these at the pelican club did he? No sir. Peter's, did you turn in your revolver when you were demobbed? Yes sir. Good, it's a pity all the boys didn't do that, it would have saved them a lot of trouble. And us. Did Robinson have a gun Peters? I don't know sir. Ah come on now, you and he were friends. Who else did he run around with. I can't say sir. Did you and Robinson quarrel this evening? Quarrel sir, us? Blimey no. That'll be Benson sir. Come in. Well Benson? Not much sir. Detective sergeant Benson's been over your pals rooms. Oh I see. Anyone you know? No. Toni, it's a new one on me sir. Dave never took out the same girl twice. Know what that is Peters? Well it isn't a toothpick. It's what we call a Jimmy. Anything known? Fits the marks on that ludgood hill job sir. I'll get that stain analyzed. Right. Anything else. Oh yes one thing more sir. So Robinson did have a gun, eh Peters. Yes sir, it seems as if he did. Golly Ted, we've never been as late as this before. No, I'll have the old man after me. Tired? Mmmabm feel a bit grim. Yeah. Poor old Dave. Ted, you're not going to get mixed up in this are you? Don't be silly. I know you, you can't kid me. Leave it alone Ted please. Let the police work it out. Course I will. What's the matter honey? Well we can't afford to get into any trouble. Who's going to get into any trouble? I've got my living to earn. Good night sweetheart. Good morning you mean darling. Night night. Very obliging of Dave to take his body to the other side of town, save a lot of trouble won't it. I wouldn't be too sure of that. They can't hang anything on us. You you mean, keep me out of this. Dead men can't talk. That's a popular theory Paul, but history hasn't always born it out. We don't know when he died. He died in the taxi. Yes but I say we don't know when he died. We don't know whether he talked before he died, to that taxi driver. Dave didn't talk. Sure? If that taxi driver had known what he got in the back of the cab, wouldn't he have gone to a hospital, wouldn't he have called the police? Don't be silly. I always try not to be silly. If that taxi driver knew anything, we wouldn't be here now, we'd be inside. It wouldn't take the police long to pick us up. I think you've got something there. Then what are you worrying about. I tell you there's nothing they can get on us. Do you know sooner or later the police are going to take a look around marsh road, and when they do they'll probably pay us a visit. Before they do, there are a couple of things I'd like to know. What? What the police said to the taxi driver. And whether they think he might have done it. Mr. Gregory's busy. It can't wait. Paul. What's the matter. It's in the paper. I know, we read them. Well I'm scared. Suppose they come round here asking me questions. But why you, you don't know anything you just work here. I knew Dave. You just danced with Dave. Sure that's right, for all you know, he was only one of the customers. Even if they get as far as this, there's nothing to suspect here. You don't know a thing about it see. But Paul. Nope Toni forget it, it's alright. What about Sunday eh? Like a trip out? Yes Paul, more than anything. We can go anywhere you say. Nothing more for the time is there chief? No nothing more for the time. Come on Toni, I'll buy you lunch. Hiya peg. Saw your picture in the paper Ted, nice. Ha ha naw, give us a cup of tea and a piece of cake girls. How are things? Not too good. I looked in at one or two agents but nothing doing yet. Well don't worry, something will turn up soon. Here we go Ted. What a nasty experience. Yeah. Have a good day. Alright Sharon. You know, I can't help feeling old Dave wanted my help. He got into my cab and I'm sure it's because he wanted to tell me something. Ted, are you on the rank tonight? No just cruising love. Ted, you're not going to. I'm just cruising love. Hello a pint of bitter please. Pint of bitter Gladys. Tah. You were in here last night, weren't you, about the same time? Yeah that's right. Oh, I've never seen you here before. No I don't come here often, just got a job this way that's all. Where'd you come from, over the other side. Yeah that's right over the other side. Gladys. Well I do. I don't think you're taking into consideration the state of the ground. Well if you ask me, I think she was pretty spiffy... You cab drivers must be doing well these days. What? Well you'd never get one this side for love or money. Can't you? I only drive for money me self. Oh go on with you. Been in the army? Oh a bit you know. Yeah I knew a boy in the army once. Really? Small world ain't it. What regiment were you in? Boy scouts. Oh ha ha go on. See you later. Yeah cheerio. You get some pretty swanky customers in here don't you? How do you mean? That blokes just gone out, you know the fella in the old doing, the old soup and fish. Oh that, that's Mr. Baker that is, he's ever so nice. Yeah, what's he do. Why he's the mc over at the palais, you know makes the announcements. Always a regular gentleman, never a word out of place. Gladys come along you. Can't call your soul your own. Let him wait, tell him I'll see him in a few minutes. Listen g, I've just been in the pub. I saw that taxi driver in there, the one that drove Dave Robinson. Did he see you? Yeah. Did you get the number of his cab? Never thought of it. Well okay it's not important. You better get back on the floor, I'll attend to this. Tell sniffy to come in here. Yes Mr. Gregory. Come in sniffy, I've got a little job for you. That taxi driver, according to the papers his names is Ted Peters. Ted Peters. I want you to find out where he keeps his cab. Here Mr. Gregory, that's the place. And that's all there was to it. Ted Peters? Thank you. Mr. Peters? Yes sir. I'm a police inspector Mr. Peters. Just a little check up, matter of routine you know. Is this your cab? Yes sir. Mind if I give it a look over? No, help yourself. Turn off for me Rob will you please? Tah. They went over it pretty thoroughly at the yard sir. Oh yes I know they did, but there are just one or two things I'd like to make sure of myself. Now I take it that Robinson's body was found on the floor? Yes I explained that. When I opened the door, it sort of slid out. Knocked me back a a bit because, well you see, me and Dave have been pals smce we was kids. I told inspector Carter. You did? Yes sir. Well we needn't go into details. I just want to make certain of one or two things. Now are you quite sure you noticed nothing unusual during the drive, like Robinson moving around or trying to attract attention? No sir, nothing unusual at all. I told inspector Carter I didn't hear a sound from inside the cab. Did Robinson ever discuss his business with you, how he got his money? Well no sir, not exactly, although I did get the impression he was under plenty of easy money. Did he ever mention any names or persons? No sir. Have you any idea where he went after he paid you off? Well that's the thing that worries me. If only I could be sure. You mean you think you have an idea. No not really, but it was somewhere close by. Why do you say that? He offered to take me there, said it was only a couple of minutes away. I see. Did you tell inspector Carter that? No sir, should I have? No, no that isn't necessary now that you've told me. Thank you Mr. Peters. Oh that's okay sir. Good day. Alright. Tah Rob. There you are Ted. Good night Elsie. Good night Elsie. Good night there. You know joy, no need to come if you don't want to. Why I didn't say I didn't want to come. I only said I didn't like it. And I don't, I'm afraid you may be right. Well then I think that's all the more reason that we ought to go. There was another cop up at the garage today. Checking up alright, but I don't think they're working fast enough. You know I want to get in there and have a shotty for me self. You coming? Course I'm coming. There's my girl. Good night peg. Cheerio. You know, I've got a feeling about this place joy. Don't ask me why, I don't know. Something seems to tell me this is the place that Dave came to. I can't get it out of my mind. Well it looks like the kind of place Dave would have come to I must say. Hello joy. Annette. Big world isn't it. Well what are you doing. Working here. Shall I see you after this dance? Yes, where? Over at the bar. Alright. Who's that? We were in the show together. Nice girl. Yeah, shall I get her a drink? Yes if you'd like, light ale, or at least she used to. Yes. Two lights please and an orange ale. Well this is a surprise. I've been here six months. Nice work if you've got the constitution. What are you doing? Oh I finished a show. Well this is Ted, Ted Peters. Oh I've heard a lot about you. You were in the army when joy and I were together weren't you? Yeah. Well any news of another job? No, I'll suppose I'll have to start looking for one now. Bit of a bad time isn't it? Most of the shows are coming off. Oh well, hope for the best. Oh that's yours. Oh thanks. Cheers. Ladies and gentlemen, by special request, the boys will now give you a jam session. How about a waltz Mr. Parker. You got your skates? Uh, excuse me will you? Paul? I want to talk to you. What's the matter? Come on upstairs, that taxi driver's just come in. Where? Over there. What's he doing here? Snooping. Staring at me as though he'd seen me somewhere. Well maybe he has. I've never seen him. He's a pal of Dave Robinson's. Yes but that, oh, maybe he's seen my photograph. What photograph? The one I gave Dave, the signed one, it was in his flat. Well that's a crazy thing to do. How was I to know you were going to. Come. Mind what you're saying. Well what do we do now. Better ask Gregory, perhaps he'll know. Well we'll see. May I? Don't go dear. No alright. How about it. Excuse me chum, come on love. Ted, Annette thinks it would be a good idea if I were to take a job here. You know dance hostess. I said I thought you wouldn't like it. Well I don't like it but, all the same I think it might be a very good idea. Do you know who I've just seen here? Toni. Who's that? You know that photograph that inspector Carter showed us, it said to Dave with love from Toni. Well she's here, working here I think, and she knows baker. You mean... I mean that we're probably on to something. If you took this job, you'd be here on the spot. You might be able to find out something to help the police. I don't like it but, would you be willing to take a chance? You bet I would. Good. All I know is, g, that I'd be a lot happier if that taxi driver were out of the way. Why not leave him to me? I haven't the slightest intention of leaving him to you, you've caused enough trouble already. Well if he has recognized me, he can go straight to the police and tell them I'm here. And what does all that add up to? Alright you knew Robinson, he was a client of yours, he was a bit sweet on you, he asked for a photograph and you gave him one, there's nothing unusual in that. You're very grieved about this. That taxi driver's our only danger. Why not let me handle him. Oh no let me, I've talked to him already, he's alright for a while. The way I'll handle him, he would turn out a very great help. I don't get it. I don't expect you to. All in good time dear Paul. And if you see sniffy, you might tell him I have another little job for him. Come over tomorrow about half past three and I'll introduce you to Mr. Baker. Don't forget now. No I won't. Thanks Annette. Oh it'll be nice having you here. We'll take care of her. Thanks, I nearly lost herjust now. It's not as bad as it seems. That's what she says. She's crazy. Knock it gang, you'll scare her. So long Annette, see you tomorrow. Bye bye. Bye bye. Seems a nice kid. Yes and she's mad about the boy. At least I think she's engaged. Look out feet, here they come. Come in. Oh good afternoon miss brown, Mr. Gregory is expecting me, it's the young lady I mentioned last night, she's here. - Annette's here Mr. - Gregory to see Mr. Baker, she's with a young lady she spoke about. Thank you sir. He's busy at the moment, he'll be out. He's ever so nice. I think you'll like him. I hope so. Mr. Baker, this is miss joy goodall. How do you do miss goodall, it's a pleasure. I'm sorry the office is a bit cluttered up at the moment, we can talk out on the balcony. Miss brown, will you have some tea sent up on the balcony please? Yes Mr. Baker. Okay Annette, thanks a lot. Thank you Mr. Baker. Good luck joy. Thank you. So you think you'd like to take a job here miss goodall? I think I'd love it. I'd certainly like you to join us. It's very difficult to get the right kind of girl you know. Do I seem the right kind of girl? You seem to me to have all the qualifications. I'm very fond of dancing. Have you done much ballroom? No, mostly stage, but I'm a good ballroom dancer. I'm not going to take your word for that. We'll have a dance after tea. Good. I suppose Annette's told you all about the conditions of working here, salary and so forth. Oh yes, we've been into all the sordid details. You might find it a little strange at first, but I'm always here. Got any bricks to throw, throw them at me. I have a feeling there will be very few bricks Mr. Baker. My friends call me Paul. Do they? Yes joy they do. Okay, Paul. That was nothing doing when Andy Wilson scored three, windham was playing Chelsea. It wasn't against Chelsea, it was the arsenal. You should know Phil, it wasn't the arsenal match, I remember it quite distinct, it rained for about an hour before the kickoff. No Fred, have a bit of common. Got me all wet. Night all. Hungry? No dad. Cor, thanks. Hey, you free? Yeah sure mate. I want to go over to lamsbeth, I can't remember the name of the street but I'll let you know when we get there. Okay hop in then. Here we are, pull off over there. Okay. Look I want to get back to west end, alright with you? Sure. Good, oh and I wonder if you'd give me a hand, I got one or two packages to bring out. Walked right into it haven't you chum? Walked right into what? Come one of you what's the idea? Don't be in a hurry Peter's, you'll find out. See this? What about it? This is the gun that killed your pal. There was only one shot fired. Now the police are pretty good at matching the gun to the bullet. They're gonna find this gun on you after we finish with you. Fancy that now. Yeah. They're gonna find this too. Read it to him Joe. Dear pero, I'm coming around on Thursday for my out and it had better be more than last time or else you and me are going to have a few words. Yeah, and it's signed Dave. It's a letter he wrote to a certain party. No names, so that certain party might quite well be you. They're gonna find it on you too Mr. Peters, tucked away in your inside pocket. Go on get moving. You've got it all thought out haven't you. Yeah, and we're gonna do better than that too. Hear that? That's one of the boys taking your cab away. Now don't do anything silly. They're taking your cab and parking it near the place where they stole that black saloon. See the idea? You stole that black saloon, and you're gonna be found in charge of it, and it's full of stolen liquor. Nice little set up eh? You and Dave Robinson, partners in war, partners |n peace. Pretty sure of yourself aren't you chum? Yeah, pretty sure. The story will be that you and two others drove up here and broke into this place. Joe here, the night watchman's going to be terribly sorry he had to hit you so hard. Got your cosh Joe? Never go far without it governor. Don't you try and sell me up chum. Get that car here quick, hurry fall back to the boss. No sir I can't say it's any of these fellas. The description you've given might fit dozens of people. This man you say was ring leader, did you hear any of them call him by name? No sir. You say you've been over that warehouse? Yes sir. What about the watchman, this man called Joe? Well the regular watchman's ill, this man was just taking his place. Nobody seems to know anything about him. And anyway he's disappeared. They've all disappeared. Lock, stock, and barrel. Was everything in order at the warehouse? Yes sir. All the stock? Yes I went over everything with the manager. Oh by the way, we picked up your taxi, it's outside. Oh thanks sarge. Now about that gun, I have no doubt it's the one that killed Robinson but where does that get us? I mean guns change hands so easily. Peters, did you get the impression that this man you drove to the warehouse was the chief? No sir, I have a feeling he was obeying orders. Oh, why? Well I don't know sir, he was giving the orders alright, but I don't think he thought them out. Eh probably a stooge. That's just the trouble. Big boys keep under cover, but they're the ones that do all the mischief. My advice to you Peters is to keep yourself out of trouble. They've got you marked down because they think you know too much. Well I can't help picking up a fare can I sir? I'm not talking about that, and in this case the fare picked you up because he knew who you were. How did he know that I wonder? I don't know. Because you kept yourself in the limelight by snooping around marsh road. Now what you told me about the palais de danse, that doesn't make a lot of sense. Well I'm not so sure about that, have you checked up on anybody there? No, who for instance? Well you remember showing me the photograph of a girl called Toni? Dave Robinson's girlfriend? Yeah. Well next time you're down at palais, have a word with her, she's working there as a dance hostess, and now she's the mc's girl. Your job is driving a taxi isn't it? Yes sir. You know if I were you, I'd stick to that. I'll give you a tip, go home and stay home until this matter's cleared up. Good night. Night sir. He's amateur detective. Who knows, I'd laugh like a drain if he was right. Yeah. I picked you for this job because I thought I could rely on you. You picked Joe because you thought you could rely on him. It seems that we were both wrong doesn't it? Honest gov I couldn't help it, he was as slippery as an eel, he seemed to have boots and fists all over him. I just couldn't help myself and that's the truth. Why didn't you use your gun? I didn't have no orders to shoot, and you keep your mouth out of this, you ain't the boss. I wouldn't if I was you. Cut that out both of you. Well sniffy it seems that you've had a piece of bad luck and let's leave it at that. Paul get sid on the phone. London's a bit too hot for you at the moment, so I'm going to send you down to the farm where you'll have a nice rest and nobody to bother you. Peters is sure to go to the police about this, and well anyway it'll be safer in the country. Sid get that truck ready, I'm sending sniffy down to the farm. Oh yes Mr. G. Shall I take Sam. Alright. Okay. Alright sniffy, get along, have a good time, and don't over talk yourself. Thanks gov. And thanks again gov for being such a sport. That's alright sniffy. Sid, I don't want sniffy back. Right. Now you're talking. Hello sniffy, nice time you picked to go on your holiday I must say. Come on sid, let's get out of here, I got no time to waste. Oh look at him, we're off it are we, I'll bring your lordship, if you please. Customers like you joy. Keep you pretty busy don't they? They certainly do. All the same, it's hardly a goldmine is it? Hardly. Would you like to make some more money, you'll get some nice connections. Silk stockings things like that. Black market? It's all surface stuff. We need people like you to deliver it and collect the money. Nice little work up too, make yourself 20 pounds a week easy. 20 pounds a week? Yes, no tax. Isn't it rather risky? I've heard they're tightening up all around. Oh you don't want to believe all you read in the papers. You realize I'm trying to do you a good turn. Oh yes I appreciate that. Well look, don't worry about it, just think it over. Only don't think out loud. Don't worry about that, I won't. Yes Mr. Baker? What'll you have? Why I'd like one of those please. Two specials please. Your girls doing alright isn't she Toni? I wouldn't know. Ain't love grand. What's the matter ducky, jealous? Can I help you sir? Hi, I'm detective sergeant Murray, I'd like to see the manager. I'll find out if he's in sir, will you please wait. Sure. Mr. Gregory, two gentlemen to see you sir, detectives. Really? Hold them there a moment, I'll ring you back. Yes Mr. Gregory. I have visitors, warn baker. Tell him and Toni to come to the upstairs cafe and wait there. I'll ring them if I need them. Yes sir. Jim. Yes sir. Okay send them up. Mr. Gregory is in sir, this way please. Excuse there, do you have a pound please mate? Sure. Excuse me just a minute, I want a word with Johnny. Excuse me please. Listen Toni I've just got a message from Gregory he wants us to go up to the balcony bar. Two plainclothes men have just come in. What? It's alright, nothing to worry about, all you've got to do is keep your head. May not even come to questioning, probably just a routine check up. Come in. Oh come in gentlemen. Hi Mr. Gregory, sorry to disturb you. I'm sergeant Murray and this is detective Perkins. How do you do? Won't you sit down. No thanks. Cigarette? No thanks, we're just checking up on a few things concerning a certain inquiry. I believe you have a young woman working here by the name of Toni. Toni masters, oh good lord yes we've had her a long time. Nice girl. Very popular. Don't tell me she's been getting into mischief. Oh gracious no, she may be able to help us that's all. Oh well I'll send for her. Find Toni and tell her to come up here at once. Yes sir. Toni, Mr. Gregory. You know like most meek and mild men, I'm an inveterate reader of detective stories. I get quite a kick out of this sort of thing. We get quite a kick out of coming here, we don't often get the luck to work in such pleasant surroundings do we? Come in. Oh come in my dear. You wanted to see me Mr. Gregory? Yes sit down. These gentlemen are from the police, they want to ask you one or two questions. Me? I believe you have a friend named David Robinson. Friend? Yes. How well did you know him. Not very well, he was just one of the customers. Oh you weren't engaged or anything like this? Me? Oh certainly not. The reason I ask is because we found this photograph in Robinson's rooms. Oh that, we give away a lot of those to the boys who come here dancing. Dance hostesses have their fans you know. I'm sure miss masters has a lot of fans. Did you ever meet him apart from your professional duties here? Once or twice, you know how it is. It didn't mean anything in my life. You remember him coming here last Thursday? No. That was the night he was killed you know. Killed? No, I don't know anything about that. Oh then you don't read the papers. And you don't remember him coming here? No. You think if he had come here you'd have seen him? I should think so. So you're pretty sure he didn't come. Well, pretty sure. Yeah. I wonder if there's anyone who could refresh your memory. Who's in charge of the dance floor? The master of ceremonies, Mr. Baker. Do you think he'd come up a minute? Certainly. Yes sir? Right here sir, I'll tell him. Mr. Gregory wants you Mr. Baker. Would you like water or soda with this? Soda. I take it you've known your mc some time? Oh yes, baker's been with me even longer than Toni. He's very popular with the customers, he's almost as big a draw as the band. Really? You want me g? Oh come in Paul. Oh I'm sorry I didn't know. Paul these gentlemen are police officers. How do you do? Mr. Baker I wonder if you can help us? You remember a young man named Dave Robinson? Dave Robinson? Yes he used to frequent this hall. Oh the boy who was murdered. I knew him by sight, yes. You did? And you knew he was killed? Yes I saw it in the paper. Killed in a taxi wasn't he, somewhere out west. Well he was killed, let's leave it at that. By all means, let's. Do you remember seeing him here last Thursday evening? No. Oh. Now we feel pretty sure that the killing occurred between the times of 8:50 and 9:10 on Thursday evening, a space of twenty minutes. That seems fair enough. We also feel pretty sure that the killing happened in this district. Really? And we realize it's very difficult for people to remember what they were doing at a given time. Do you think so? I should have thought it had been fairly easy. Now would you? Do you think you could prove what you were doing between the times of 8:50 and 9:10 on Thursday last? Well of course I was um. Yes? Well I must have been. Yes? Well this is ridiculous. See what I mean? Paul don't be silly, of course you remember, least you ought to. I'll tell you where he was, he was at the bar giving me a telling off for having too much to drink and not getting on with my work. Johnny the barman will verify that. Yes that's right Toni, I remember now. How can you be sure of the time? It's easy. It was just after the first part dance. Well that must have been a pretty good telling off. Good night. Night. Good night. Oh thanks for your help. That was a very interesting experience, fearless types these policemen. Nice work Toni. Nice work my foot. If you think I'm going to get dragged into this just to cover up for you, you're making a big mistake. From now on you can think up your own alibi's. Oh now listen sweetheart. And you can cut that out too. I've been watching you and that baby face brat you've just hired, if you think you can two time me, you're mistaken. Oh come on Toni. Oh leave me alone. You'd better be very careful Paul, she might be dangerous. I can handle her. You've got to somehow. Excuse me are you dancing? No, that's just the way I walk. Get me another scotch Johnny. You think you ought to? Shut up, I know what I'm doing. You know Mr. Baker's orders. I don't give a hoot for Mr. Baker. Cheerio Johnny. Johnny here sir. Yes right away. Now the boss is asking for me. Take my tip go easy on that stuff, it's libel to bite. Come in. Johnny I have a job for you on Friday night. Yes Mr. Gregory. This time the rake off will be really worthwhile. It's taken a lot of planning and the deadline's Friday. After that, we'll take some time off. We should be able to afford to. Sounds fine sir, but will it be alright with the cops so close to us? Oh don't worry about that, that's just routine stuff. Johnny, where's Toni? Down at the bar knocking them back. You'll have to watch that girl Paul. Okay, keep an eye on her Johnny, I'll be down in a few minutes. Too low to find out which way we go. Hop out and have a look will ya sniffy. Yeah, okay sid. Turn right. Now. Okay. Hey hey! Sid! Hop out Sam and make sure. Okay, here we go. Give me a large ginger beer will you Johnny? Thirsty work yours eh joy? How you liking it here? Oh it's getting to be very interesting. You're telling me, and all the fun isn't on the dance floor either if you know what I mean. I've got an idea. Talking about me? No of course not. Why should I? I didn't know whether you thought I was amusing. Why don't you give this place a miss. Come back again when you're a little older. Why what do you mean? The atmosphere isn't healthy. That's about the straightest tip you'll ever get. You better take it. Toni, why don't you go home, you've had enough. I'm not interfering with you. Go look after your new girlfriend, she's glad enough for a little attention. Come on Toni have some sense. Stop picking on me. I've taken all I'm going to. I've known men who were worth a dozen of you, even Dave Robinson. Shut up! Toni I'm sorry. Toni. Ted. Hello honey what are you doing here? I thought you were in bed asleep? I had to see you. Well what's up? The police have been to the palais and questioned Toni and baker. I don't know what they found out, but Ted you were right about that crowd, they're in the black market. How do you know? Baker's been taking a bit of notice of me. And tonight he put it quite plainly that I could join the gang. Well go on. Well after the police left, Toni had lots of drinks, and she and baker had a row. She told him he wasn't as good a man as Dave Robinson. What? And then he went as white as a sheet and slapped her face and she ran out of the place. But the look he gave her was, it was frightening. You know things are beginning to add up. He slapped her face when she mentioned Dave. That means there must be some tie between Dave and baker. Look honey when you go there tomorrow, keep your ears and eyes open, find out everything you can. Okay Ted. But you don't go getting mixed up in it will you. Me? I'm just gonna sit at home and read all about it in the papers. Come in. Yes? Is Mr. Baker in with Mr. Gregory? I brought my photo for outside the palais. They're not to be disturbed. Will you leave it with me. Thanks, good night. Good night. That last batch wasn't as good as the first Paul. No I had a word with sid, he's going to talk to the boys about it. We won't accept it if they won't play ball the way we want it. They'll play ball. Okay. And what about the other little matter? The gin? Yes? If the stuff's as good as they say we ought to take some. That's what I thought. Well we'll talk about it later when you've seen spider Blaine. Okay. What have we done about Toni? I went to her flat, she's alright, got a bit of a hangover, I told her to pack. She's your liability you know Paul. Sid's taking her down to the farm after we've done the job. Ah. No thank you. Now this wrigley and masterman affair, you get there at 11 o'clock sharp. If there happens to be a cop there, well the boys can deal with it. Five minutes later we can be okay to the trucks. They'll come in, one behind the other, to the goods entrance where the gates will be ready to open. I've had the firms name painted on the trucks. Well nobody's going to query wrigley and masterman's own trucks leaving all the shub after we've got the stuff. I like that. Nice touch. I better go down and see that everything's okay below. We don't want any snoopers around tonight. I've had a pretty good checkup, nobody's talking. Police haven't got any further, even your taxi driver pal doesn't seem to have been round lately. Oh I think that little affair is blowing over nicely. 11 o'clock, this should be easy. Right. Johnny. Everything's set for tonight Johnny. Got your orders about 11 o'clock. Yeah it's all clear. Evening Mr. Baker. Good evening. Be seeing you Johnny. You bet. Annette I want to phone, have you got tuppence? Here you are honey. Oh thanks clear so much. Ted. Hello. I think he's around somewhere, hold on, I'll find out. Ted Peters! Hello? Phone! Okay coming. Just coming miss. Thanks pop. Hello? Oh hello sweet. They're what? Are they? I didn't hear everything, but there's something doing. It's at wrigley and masterman's, you know, that big store on Oxford street. They're timing it for 11 and baker's going to be there. Well where's Toni? She's what? Not there, well where is she then? They're taking her out of town to some farm. Well that proves she knows something and they're trying to get her out of the way to stop her talking. I'm gonna ring inspector Carter and put him onto it. But Ted I know you're going there yourself. You mustn't. I'll just go and look I promise. If there's anything that looks suspicious, I'll find inspector Carter. That a deal? I suppose so, but do take care. Okay. See you later darling. Bless you. Bye. Hello Paul. Hello joy. Finished early? No I'm just going out for a minute. I'll be back later. Where's Toni? She's at home, feeling a bit sorry for herself. What she needs is a holiday. Why don't you give her one? That's just what I'm going to do. Yes? Who is it? Sid. Oh sid, I'm nearly packed, I'll be ready by the time you get round. Be over for you in a minute ducky. The sooner the better for me. Thanks a lot sid. What do you want? Sorry to butt in like this, but we need your help. This isn't one of my public spirited nights. Really? I'm busy. Going away? I don't usually pack a suitcase to stay at home. No they don't for holloway either. What do you mean? Oh nothing, nothing. I told you all I knew the other night. I've nothing more to add. You told it so well that my chief has a wan desire to hear it for himself. I'm not going and that's final. Really? Now you come along with me and I'll tell you some funny stories. I bet you could. And that's all I know. Thank you miss masters. You've told me exactly the same story as you told sergeant Murray. But something new has turned up. Last night you quarreled with Mr. Baker. I'd been drinking. Yes but during that quarrel, you mentioned the name of Dave Robinson and baker slapped your face. Can you explain that? I, I told you I, I'd been drinking. That's not the true explanation. But take your time and think it out. We've got all night before us and there won't be any drinking. Okay. Alright Paul bring the trucks in. Good evening. Mr. Peters isn't it? What brings you here? Oh hello inspector. Then it was a straight tip off, is there anything doing? Oh plenty my men have just gone in. The trucks are in there, we should be making a pinch at any moment. Want to come in and see the fun. Yeah sure, I'd love to get a crack at that jerk baker. You might even have a chance to do that. What beats me is how you got on to this. Who gave you the tip off? Well it was joy. I told inspector Carter she was working at the palais. Well well joy. Yeah she's my fiance, you'll have to meet her sometime. Well I should look foward to it. Keep going and don't try anything. Looks as if I've been a bit of a mug again doesn't it. How did you get on to this? You'd be surprised, he's just been good enough to tell me. His girlfriend gave him the tip off. Girlfriend? Your latest weakness. Joy the demure little dance hostess. I'm going straight back to take care of her. You look after Peters. It should be right up your street. Yes right up my street. We'll leave him here for the cops. Don't worry g, he won't talk. You've gotta work fast Paul and get back to marsh road, see you there. Okay. Move. Get that stuff loaded up boys hurry. Pogson come with me. That'll hold him for awhile. Go help the other's load up and then get out. I'll deal with him. Okay get going Jim. Load up first. Trucks are loaded, should I help you tie him up? No. You clear off, I can handle it. Okay first get going. Try and think back miss masters. You're wasting your time. You think so? You know I've got an idea if you try. Inspector Carter here. Who? Ted Peters. Yes Peters? You what? Yes. Where? Right I'll see to it. There's been a job down at wrigley and masterman's, that's Peters phoning from the store. He's laid baker out. He's now on his way to the camelwood palais. That'll be two cars. Yes tend to the vigo's will you? I suppose you want to come sir? I just hate to miss it. You heard that, we've got baker. Won't be long before we've got the rest of the gang. Now if you want to help yourself, the best thing you can do is talk and talk quickly. Okay. Yes, okay. Alright thank you sir. Hm3 from m257 message number 107, wrigley and masterman shop premises, number 907 Oxford street, broken into. Pick up Paul baker. Hm2 from m257, message number 925, proceed to palais de danse marsh road. Pick up mister ej Gregory, manager. Johnny, send joy goodall up here at once. Then get your coat on and come up as well. Car ready? Yes sir. Good, have it brought round to the side door before you come up and hurry. Come in. Ah hello joy. You sent for me? Yes. We're going on a little trip. I'm sure you're not going to be silly enough to raise any objections. A little object lesson in minding ones own business. The trouble is, I don't think you can possibly be allowed to profit by it. By this time young Mr. Peters has already received his lesson from Mr. Baker. Where's Ted? What have you done to him? I do not guess, I should think he is well on his way to meeting his friend Dave Robinson. I wouldn't take too much to heart, you have worries enough of your own. Nothing to the worries you've got coming. If you hurt him. I said keep calm. Already gov. Take her down to the car. Is she? Yes a narc. Well. Who would've thought that. Now lively joy, I'm more afraid of these firearms I've got in me hand. What are you laughing at? I said I would laugh like a drain if that boy was right. Well don't. No. Paul baker I'm arresting you for breaking and entering these premises. Anything you say may be used in evidence. Come along now. Now no noise joy. By the way sir, that's Gregory. He seems to be in a temper. Yes. Joy! I thought I told you to keep out of this? But I'm not sorry you didn't. I think I better get her home inspector. Yes that's a good idea. See to it will you? Yeah Williams, get young Sherlock Holmes a taxi. Very good sir. Okay. Your poor face. Well you know it may improve it. Taxi!
