Fire in the stables! Let's go see what's going on The ones responsible must still be around Who could it have been? I don't think we'll ever know, but they're saving the animals Come on, let's go I'm sure the burning of the stables was a trick, there was no reason to have done that If I find them I'll smash em with my bare hands! Why would they do it? I don't have the slightest idea It isn't possible, this is the work of our enemies We have to speak with them Cowards How terrible We're ready, they've taken them Let's go Did you catch him? Yes, he was one of the attackers Why did they want to burn the stables? The thing with the stables was just a ruse, we have to learn what they really came for Let's go Soon the astral conjunction will align with the Almighty Star and it will give us great magical power There it is. I told you Sylvia, we're in the right spot, that's the signal It's very strong, there's no doubt It's the strongest magnetic field that can exist, and as concentrated as a laser It's incredible Father Listen, gather the equipment Take it to the boat. You two stand guard Let's go daughter Do you hear the frequency? Now? Yes... something The blonde westerners are on the way Yeah, that's better Better What happened? - Close? - Yes The man without a face is heading our way too Yes Careful, follow me Destroy them! Father, we can't leave them here, we have to help them! There's nothing to be done here, let's go, let's go! The man without a face, go after him Come! Help Tinieblas and bring me the man without a face! Finally Queria, he is yours Yes, and he will serve me Let him go I have touched him and now his strength is mine You have accomplished it He will carry out my orders himself and will dominate my enemies! Later, I'll destroy him It's a masterful stroke Queria You will bring me the blonde woman It's incredible, do you realize? A palace in the middle of the jungle and it's not marked on any map - It's extraordinary - Yes, it's marvellous Marvellous, yes I went to look for him in the morning and he was gone, Santo has disappeared I'm sure he would have let me know where he was going We'll look for him immediately, he must be nearby Nothing will happen to him I hope so Sir Some people are approaching the palace Who could they be? Let's go You are welcome What do you seek in these lands? I'm Professor Williams of the University of Nova Scotia She's my daughter Sylvia We're here making a study concerning magnetic forces - Forces? - Yes Magnetic? And how do you carry out that study? Well you see, at the university I'm in the astrophysics department, this is a strange phenomenon that has drawn our attention and we must look into it And to what use will you put the studies you're carrying out? They're just preliminary studies to locate and analyze the energy Last night I was in the place where the signals seemed to have originated That woman was performing a rite with an object that was the most important I've seen in my career as a scientist You mentioned a place, what place? It seemed to be a temple containing a luminous rock Professor, the woman you saw was not her What? And besides, we thought she no longer existed What are you trying to say? Professor, that was Queria, Kungyan's twin sister The place you saw Queria was the temple of the Almighty Star and she has no right to be there It's a place sacred to us A sacred place? Yes, on it converge all the forces of the universe Did she obtain it? The person you saw last night profaning that place uses the power for evil Not just evil, but also murder That monster killed two of my men last night Santo, what happened, where were you? You cad, you poor excuse for a man! And may I have the strength to recover that which has been torn from me Prince, come, something serious has happened! What happened? The man without a face came He beat us and kidnapped the Professor's daughter - His daughter? - Yes, I'll explain later, the Professor's daughter The man without a face did that? Yes No, it wasn't him! He was acting like he was bewitched, he even hit me! I know what happened Yes... Queria has returned That explains it all The man without a face is under her power My sister's evil knows no bounds Astral energies, come unto us Open it That's not her, you've made a mistake In the palace there's another blonde girl who you already know, the Jungle Girl I want you to bring her here She came with the other explorer Lock her up, she'll also be of use As you say my lady Gentlemen, you have to do something for my daughter and I, please understand Professor, my sister Queria has become a very dangerous and astute woman We have to plan things out carefully And this time we can't count on the man without a face Be patient Professor, I beg you, we'll do even the impossible Now go rest - Let me go! Let me go! - They're taking the girl! Boss, boss, what's wrong? It looks like my sister's powers are losing their strength When he recovers he'll be as he always was Carry him carefully These dark clouds which are crossing over our path will soon disappear and the sun of happiness will greet us on our wedding So much evil, Ying-Qa, we're surrounded by so much evil We'll begin a new life and it will be full of joy What happened? My sister used her power on you, turning you into an evil being in her service What did I do? You came and kidnapped the Professor's daughter and took her to Queria, you then tried to do the same with the Jungle Girl How horrible Making her believe I'm still under her control, I'll go to the temple and bring back your daughter Professor, I promise Tell me oracle, why has the man without a face not returned? The man without a face is no longer under your influence, you have no more power over him The drums speak, let's go see the high priest Colaca whose reign extends to the islands of the south has sent his son Tegal with rich presents for the wedding of the Chinese prince and the jungle girl Do you know how we can take advantage of that young prince, Queria? You'll have a most pleasant surprise Here it is Father! There she is Open it Close it You too? He's my friend, I'll explain later Come out This way Here he is It's Tegal himself, son of the great king Colaca. Take him! and bring me the real one. His father would give anything - to have him back at his side - Understood Let's go Prince, my lord, what's wrong? Who are these men? What's wrong lord? Are you ill? How did you leave the camp? That way Come here Come closer Take Tegal's place Bravo, the boss always triumphs! I expected no less from you Thanks to him, I've recovered my daughter Thank you Here is the real Tegal My power will be very great having the son of the great Colaca Now take care of Tegal and tomorrow expect the man without a face who will die in this very temple I will go to my sister's palace and take her place - And tell me- - The Jungle girl Is she your daughter or something? The Jungle Girl came to us in this way Many years ago, in a nearby forest, we were drawn by a strange light The prophecy had been fulfilled The star with it's cosmic energy brought us the Jungle Girl who was raised among tame wolves Queria, feeling that she had been replaced, decided to abandon us and to take the path of evil That stone is the Almighty Star, it came from the cosmos and brings us all it's energy and wisdom and she is a deity Welcome son of the great king Colaca Crown prince Tegal, you are in your home May the gods bless you Raguri, great lord of the cosmic forces, my father has sent me to the wedding of the Jungle Girl with his excellency the prince Ching-Qa These presents, full of the love of our people, are for your eternal happiness Great prince Tegal, I'm pleased to present you to the man without a face, a man of goodness who has helped us very much Welcome great prince Tegal The oracle told me that the Almighty Star was stolen and is in my sister Queria's hands This is ridiculous! Your excellency, I'd like to spend a few brief moments alone with you With pleasure We can no longer postpone the wedding, my sister has gone too far, we must finish her in her own temple Yes, we've had enough patience I understand that even you, who are benevolence itself can no longer stand it Can I count on you? I'm always at your side, you can count on me And with me too! I have to speak with the Jungle Girl My daughter, I have to speak to you alone Yes maam What a dangerous situation this energy has caused Envy, ambition What you have seen is the culmination of much effort that Raguri and I have made to save you Why? Because prince Ching-Qa is not the one destined to marry you What are you saying? Yes, he has allied himself with my sister Queria's evil and has provoked all these situations that have caused you so much pain What's going to happen now? King Colaca, who's possessions know nearly no limit, has offered us his help and his son Tegal to wed you But how can this be? This very night we'll carry out a secret wedding in the temple of the Almighty Star and then we'll make my sister and that cursed prince who's caused so much damage disappear Tell me, how many armed servants can we count on? - Only four - That's not enough That's too few, can you get more? Yes, but it would have to wait until tomorrow, perhaps another 20 That's no good, we'll have to do with what you have We'll have to go tonight I'll go with you Very well. Let's get prepared - There's no one here - Indeed This smells fishy We have to be careful Get me out of here! Help! Let me out please! Help! Please! Relax, I'm opening it What were you doing here? I was bringing some wedding presents when I lost consciousness at night and I don't know what happened after that, the only thing I've seen is this terrible massacre Weren't you at Raguri's palace? Me? I've never been in the palace Something very strange is going on here aside from all these horrid things you see here but I think I know who's capable What a battle boss, what a slaughter! Yes Cliff, but more tragedies might happen We have to go to the temple of the Almighty Star, something terrible may happen there. There's nothing more we can do here Here they are high priest, ready for the great ceremony - We're going to be very happy - For eternity What's happening? My daughter You've been chosen to save our people, giving us all power with the sacrifice of your life What are you doing here, did you come back already? Come back? From where? You just left with everyone else a bit ago I didn't go out Where is everyone else? They stole the Almighty Star, we don't now where they went Professor, please accompany to the temple of the Almighty Star, I feel that something terrible is happening! Of course Murderer! Let's go Kungyang Priestess of benevolence Hear me Kungyang, hear me It's the voice of the oracle The Jungle Girl is a deity that came with the cosmic energy to personify love and benevolence She has been betrayed and her mission has been cut short She must return to her home and the astral forces that created her now reclaim her The End Translation: Turdis July 2009
