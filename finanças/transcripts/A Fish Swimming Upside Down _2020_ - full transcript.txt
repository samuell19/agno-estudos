A squirrel. Yes. I'm a... Boar. Boar. It's my turn again. Bee? Wasp? Bumblebee? Mosquito. Yes, a mosquito. Wow. With a giant mouth. Crocodile! Crocodile. A beetle, that’s lying on its back. That’s what it looks . A dog ! A diving beetle. A dog! No! A fish. A fish? Yes. Obviously. Upside down. Now it’s Clara’s turn. That’s a… yeah, what is that? An elephant. Ok. That's right. Now it's my turn. A frog! No! Correct. A frog. What are you doing here? You know what I’m doing. You never really cared, did you? Come on then, talk to me. I just did! Here’s some space for your things. It looks much better already. And we’ll have the new bed soon. Will you bring me something? Do you want some balance sheets? Oh, yes. Maybe a small tortoise. Or a stone. A stone? Right. I’ll bring you a stone. If I had a garden like yours, I’d never use the house. Seriously, I’d do everything outside, sleep… I’m happy to swap. You can live here with my dad and I can have some peace. He’s really annoying at the moment. All he does is say how great and wonderful everything is, and how I should seize, grab it and then I’ll be happy. Because of his girlfriend? I guess so. She’s so annoying. Really? I reckon, it’s good if he’s in love. I mean, he can’t stay depressed about Hannah for ever. We got you your favourite pizza. With extra cheese. I don’t like cheese. Oh, really? Well, that sucks. Here. Wasn’t that just the scene where they walk along the platform? Looks like you share the same tastes. Can you stop chatting and making so much noise?! May I? I know that this isn’t easy for you. You don’t know anything. Ok, I don’t know anything. But it’s obviously hard for you. What are you reading? I only read magazines now. Women’s magazines. The best make-up tips, the latest fashions. Recipes, horoscopes. You’re Aries, aren’t you? Mars and Jupiter are favourable, they’ll give you strength for the day-to-day, your weekend will be super and your spirits and communications skills will improve. You don’t think that’s funny, do you? And even if you did, you wouldn’t show it. Ok. Good night. Hello. Hello. You must be Nadya? Nadezhda. I’m Andrea. Hello. Can I help you? No, it’s ok. I’d known you were coming, I’d have cleaned up a bit. It’s fine, really. No problem. I’ve got time. Miss, please, leave that. You don’t have to call me Miss. Ok. See you later. See you later. I’m finished. Thank you. Nadezhda, please, sit down. Here, try this. Thank you. You’ve been working here quite a while, haven’t you? I know the family very well. Do you know how Hannah died? Suddenly, in her sleep. Just like that. What did she die of? I don’t know. Something about her heart. And Philipp didn’t notice anything. I’d like to die like that. And it was very hard for Martin. He couldn’t… Hannah must have been a wonderful person, if she was allowed to die in such a nice way. You’re always going away. I’ll be back in two days. Ciao. Ciao. Here. Thanks. I didn’t hear you come in. I’m quiet. How’s Philipp? Where is he? Working. Philipp? Morning. Hopefully there’ll be pancakes for breakfast. Do you know where the cinnamon is? No, I don’t. They’ll be ready in ten minutes. Do you remember Mathilde? The blonde girl with the plaits? The one who was surrounded by balloons and didn’t move. She suddenly jumped up and went over to the piano and played really well! Really? That was nice. They surprise me again and again. And little Dominik was pretending to be a monkey the whole time. Listen, I have to finish up here, ok? I want to work. You want to work? Stop it, ok? On Tuesday evening I'll be back and then I'll spend a lot of time with you. Screw it! I just take you with me. Can I help? If you think you can do better, go ahead. It’s best if you take two of these, then it's easier. Can I have one? There you go. Thanks. Where would you rather go? Into space or to the bottom of the sea? For research? No, in general. Just to see it? Space would be pretty awesome. Bullseye! Hello. Everything ok? Yes. Will you be long? Yes, just a bit. And how are you? I’m ok. Because of her? She’s a bit weird. She didn’t say hello to me last week. She ate strawberries and she was… Yes? Yes. Super considerate, well… But you’re a man. I’m just the cleaner. That's why. Can I get started? Yes. I’ll be gone soon. Shall we start again? One, two, three... Now for the last mouthful. Oh God! How long did you need? 3 hours and 15 minutes? A new record. 42km in 1 hour and 50 minutes. It’ll be better next week. I’m sure of it. You’re good, you are. Potential. Yes, I saw something. You too? I didn’t see anything. I felt just... ...sick. Philipp. I’m not here. No, no, no, I’m not here. Hello? Hello. Oh, I’m sitting here all alone. I’ve gone out on my bike. Martin’s gone out on his bike. I know he doesn’t have a light, but… I can play the Cembalo and the harmonica. Did you know that he can play the Cembalo and harmonica? I practised all day. He practised all day. Yes, there’ll be a small concert when you’re back. Thank you. That’s strange. She’s always quite friendly to me. He wasn’t capable of experiencing freedom, but his humour was legendary”. Sounds quite interesting. Are you ok? Yes. I don’t want it to stop. What? Us. I met her again last week. It was good. Not just the sex, but she’s funny, you know? But she’s also a bit neurotic. Well, then she’s perfect for you. And how’re you? What do you mean? Well, how’re things at home? They’re ok. She’s not using Philipp? I don’t know, but she’s actually really nice. Ok. But last time you said… See you later. I think she looks good. Let’s go to my room. Very delicious. Thank you. Really fantastic. Great. It’s nice that you’re back. And how was it? As always. I had to explain to some idiots that my offer is the best thing. Then there’s a back and forth. It’s exhausting, but it always works. Everything worked out at the airport though? More or less. Except that my suitcase never arrived. I was waiting at the baggage reclaim and thought ‘Where’s my bag? Where is it? Then I remembered that I only travelled with hand luggage. Stupid, really. Getting old... And what happened last week? Well, nothing special. As always. But what about the problem? There are always problems; little ones, big ones. You mean when he stormed off? I stormed off? Yes, you came home totally worked-up and said that a copier… someone had chucked a copier out of the window. Then that guy was fired? The co-worker. You stormed in last week… Completely pale. Pale, covered in sweat; you came in and said some guy had thrown the copier out of the window… Paper was lying all over the street… The paper on the street was flying everywhere, A4, A3, A5… The police came… When did this happen? Wednesday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Something like that. I really can’t remember. That’s not possible. You’re joking. You know exactly what we’re talking about. You’re just tricking us. No, I really can’t remember. You’re funny. So incredibly funny. Unbelievably funny, really. It was just a bit of fun. Yes, I laughed. No, you didn’t. I did, you just didn’t realise. Can't you remember? What are you doing out here all this time? Grab her! Nadya. We haven’t seen each other in ages. How are you? Good. You don’t need to clean the bedroom. Bye. See you this evening. I’ll be back around 9. We’ll cook something nice. We’ll try, at least. I can’t wait! I’ve never had sex in a kid’s room. What are you talking about? What do you mean? This isn’t a kid’s room. Of course it is. Bring it down again. Jesus Christ! It's so high. I don’t know how high it can go… Should I get it while it’s flying? Ok. Maybe here. But slow! It’s coming! It’s as if it’s whinging at the end. There? Yes. Breath against it. It’s hard. I’ve got a good idea. Should we make Martin out of Play-Doh? Yes. Ok, we’ll make a Play-Doh model then. Yes. Should we use this one? I'll make the body. Body? This one can be his chest. What? This is the chest of the body. Yes. Now we're making arms. We have to go now. Do you want us to hold hands? Yes. There also. And go out? The other one too? Right. And now go out. Ok, then we’ll go outside. And you? No. Bye. Bye. That was too easy. You’re not even playing properly. No, come on. I’m really bad at this. Andrea? Check. There’s Nadya. Take a seat. How are you? Good. Are you friends now? What do you mean? Have you seen something? I haven’t seen anything. You were six years old. Just turned six, yes. One day, as I left the house a bit late, and suddenly thought: ‘Where are our roses?’ Where were they? Well, he had cut them all off. He’d taken them to school and put them on Mrs Lamprecht’s table, his teacher, who he was obviously deeply in love with. Were you in love? Maybe a bit. From ear to ear. And then there’s another story. My father once tried to get him to… You can tell us something. What should I tell? I don’t know, just a story from your childhood. That’s long ago. I can’t remember anymore. There has to be something. Just a small story. Friends… I don’t have a past. Not now. Good night. Didn’t you go jogging with Andrea? No. As you can see. I’m just asking. No, you’re not just asking. You know and you’re asking dumb rhetorical questions, just so say something. What’s up with you? What’s up with you? Martin, I’m not in the mood for these games. Whatever. I’ll see you this evening. I love you. Me too, of course. What do you mean ‘of course’. Nothing. But it’s simply not true. You can’t know that. If you really loved me, then you wouldn’t sleep with him as well. Where are you going? I’m done. That one’s quite nice. It’s huge. Well... We’ll get lost in it. That’s too small. Show me the other one again. I’m sorry, it’s starting again. It’s ok. I don’t know what’s wrong with him. He’s jealous. What are you doing here? I love you. Where’s Philipp? Are you actually listening to me? I said: I love you. I think it’s for the best if I go. This isn’t working. I’ll move out. No. You’re not ok, and I’m not ok either. Yes, but I’m better when I’m with you. Then I’m fine. But you’re jealous. I’m not jealous. It’s just the way it is right now. It’s better already. I’m not so sure. What aren’t you sure about? If this is such a good… ... Idea. What happened? Show me. Wait. It’s not so bad. It’ll be better soon. Thank you. I can’t just get rid of her. Andrea has never said she feels uncomfortable. Yes, but she told me. What exactly? That little Nadya is screwing with her? No, just that she feels somehow uneasy, that Nadya never greets her, that she doesn’t feel at home here. I think we can manage alone. You cleaning the house is something I’d like to see. You don’t even know how to use the washing machine. She steals. What? My camera. I found it in her backpack. Ok, let’s do something else. Ok, what? Hold our breath? Ok. You count. Yes. The key. Thank you. I don’t want you to take it the wrong way, you’ve done a really great job, and this has got absolutely nothing to do with your work. If you need anything, then please let me know, ok? Why did you lie? Because she saw us. She didn’t steal anything. Yes, I know that. But I did it to protect us. And now she’s lost her job. I know. What’s going on? Should I put you to bed? Come on then. These things are difficult to get in. But the new bed’s quite good, isn’t it? Yes, it’s good. By the way, Jens asked if he can come. I thought I’d ask. Of course. Yes? Cool. Lovely. It looks just the same. You’ve been here before? Yes. The last time was when I was 15. Just before it happened... twenty-six twenty-seven twenty-eight twenty-nine, thirty. Coming! Hey Jens, I see you! Damn, I even went back a little. I saw your feet. Papa! Papa! Let’s wait for the others. Over there? I was convinced that you despised me. Always. You had this look, even as a baby, that was so… And whenever I went into your room you hid from me or ran away. It was just a game. During puberty, when you were 14, or 13, that was... ... phew! To be honest, I sometimes wished that you wouldn’t come back. I suffered so much. I always asked myself: What can I do? How should I behave? But everything’s ok now. Really? Yes. Yes, I think so too. Since Andrea’s been here, we’ve both been better. You’ve opened up much more, you’re enjoying life more. True. She’s an amazing woman. No matter what happens, I’ll do whatever I can so that you’re happy. No matter what happens? Of course. No matter what happens. What do you mean by that? You know exactly what I mean by that. Do you know where we are? Yes, I’ll definitely find the way back to the hut. Well, they were there just a minute ago.They’re probably waiting for us. Look at that! Those look tasty. Don’t eat them! I think they’re poisonous. Do you know about mushrooms? I know that ribbed mushrooms are sometimes poisonous. I think they are poisonous. They’ve probably worked-out that we took the short-cut. Yes, they’ll turn up. Do you want to play chess? You play often? Yes. And I always win. We’ll see about that. It’s not possible! They were ahead of us earlier. Let’s turn back. It’s getting dark. They’re probably waiting for us. Hold on! They just got lost. Calm down. Leave me alone. You can’t know everything. What have you been doing? Why are you laughing? What’s up with you? Nothing. I asked you something. Ok, well, we got lost and then we came back and then she took her clothes off and lay on the floor, and then I fucked her. It was awesome. Shut the fuck up! I’m sorry, Jens It’s not your fault. Do you want to say something? Are you crazy? What? It was just a joke. Yeah, well, it wasn’t funny. Are you coming for a swim? No. There’s a right turn and then take two lefts, and then you get to a dark room. That’s where the MRT should go. We’ll never fit it in. We… Good morning. Morning. What’s up? Are you eating breakfast already? You went out, huh? Drink something. Don’t worry. How’re things? Do you want something to eat? It’s ok. I’ll sleep. Looks like he had a good time. Well, in any case, we’ll have to take the whole thing apart and carry it, screw by screw, to this tiny room and then re-assemble it. Hey, it was just a joke. I don’t understand. It’s hard to explain. I mean… I think she’s not always as honest as she seems. I’m just a bit scared that you’re too … that… that you won’t see it. Yes. And how is she dishonest? I don’t know… she says that she loves you. But do you always, 100%, have that feeling? I just think that she sometimes seems to be playing a kind of game. Are you thinking about him? Martin, please. What do you mean: ‘please’? Where are you? I’m here. Where is ‘here’? Here! Stop! Where is your love? Tell me, that you love me! I’m suffocating. Wait. Wait! What’s wrong with you? Nothing. Come here. I don’t want to. Come here. No. Please come back. This isn’t funny. Come back. Come over here. No. You don’t dare. Are you scared? Come on then! Play it back in your mind. You’re standing behind the railings… He was there, and then he wasn't there. I don’t know what happened. I can't do this. How did your son seem the last time you saw him? Had something changed? Did you notice anything different? He was... ...quiet. Aggressive and very moody. Can you imagine that your son would take his own life? I can imagine that. I can imagine that. He really did like you. Hello. Hello. I have to speak with you. Andrea and Martin were in a relationship. A romantic relationship. And why are you telling me this now? Is there anything else you want to tell me? No. It would be nice if you could work for us again. Yes, but it doesn’t fit, does it? Yes. Oh yes. I found this in the attic. No idea who it belonged to; maybe my grandmother. It’s very pretty.
