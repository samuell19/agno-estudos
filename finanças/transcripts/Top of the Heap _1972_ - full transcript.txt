(crowd shouting) - Look at that, looking good. (sirens wailing) (exciting music) - Bullshit. (funky music) - Goddamn pigs. (woman laughs) - You gotta talk to Valerie. You know where I caught her today? In Mr. Cecile's garage with that Fernandez boy. I don't even know what to say to her anymore. - Don't say anything. - What do you mean don't say anything? You've gotta talk to her. - What difference does it make, Vi? She's only 13 years old. Besides, that little boy can't even get a hard-on yet. - George, Valerie is almost 14. - Okay, okay, I'll talk to her about it. Look, I got something important I wanna tell you. - Well, that's important. I mean, it is important that I caught Valerie screwing in the garage? - Yes, Vi, but I don't wanna talk about it right now. - Valerie is getting to be a problem. - Bullshit. Look, she's a young, growing girl. She's just trying to find out what's happening between her legs. - Oh, why don't you cut it out? You really don't care, do you? - Of course I care, I just don't wanna get into a thing about it right now. - All you care about is putting on that damn uniform and gun and playing the big nigger cop. Oh, I'm going to bed. (dramatic tones) You know what? I'm gonna do just like you. I'm not gonna care either. - Hey, George. - Tony. - I just heard about your mother. - How old are you? - [Tony] She's 12. - Talk to Valerie. - George, I hear they passed over you again for sergeant. - So what? - Nothing, except that they did some juggling of the eligibility list. And if they hadn't upgraded Skullsworth the last minute, and you know Skullsworth-- - Man, what the hell are you talking about? - Well, the next time the exams come up, they can't pass over you and me. - Pellegrino, if you really believe that those examinations have anything to do with you becoming a sergeant, I mean if you really believe that, then, man, you deserve to eat all they put on your table. - What do you mean? I wanna know what you mean. Why won't you just come out and say what you mean? - Morning, Lattimer. (funky music) - Man, the natives are active tonight. - There's a full moon. Only it's so goddamn hazy, you can't hardly see it. - Yeah. - George. - What? - How much time are you taking off? - What? - Captain Walsh told me about your mother passing away. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. And if there's anything I can do-- - Like what? - I'm sorry. - Sorry about what? - What do you mean? - What you so sorry about? - All right, look, I don't want to get into any shit tonight. - No, what you so goddamn sorry about? - Besides, I gotta buy me some quick cash here. (dreamy tones) - Duplicate relay systems charts read 203.1. 408.7. 205.1. 503.2. 207.3. 504.3. (phone ringing) - I'll get it. Lattimer. - [Operator] Your mother is dead. (somber music) - Is anything wrong, George? - It was a wrong number. (funky music) - Man, this fat bird is looking good, Jim. Here. - You're dripping the grease on the grass, baby. - I don't drip no grease on the grass, shit. - Give us a squeeze, baby. - Damn, man, look at that shit. Oh, I hate to be wasting shit every time I try to get a little, then I got to be wasting grapes and shit all over this table. I almost wasted that jive in the blow. This blow is really outta sight. Mm. Damn, man. You know what I forgot to do? I forgot to go down to the unemployment office today, you understand, and pick up my unemployment. (laughs) I'm not jiving. - How the hell you gonna collect some unemployment, baby, when you ain't never had a J-O-B? (dramatic music) - Say, brother, what it is? You gonna shoot us, man? Or you gonna let us go? You gonna bust us, man, put us off in the joint? Take away our freedom? - Ain't got nothing but some silly shit here, baby. We ain't carrying nothing heavy. Know what I mean, brother? Just sitting here trying to make a clean little hustle, that's all. - That's all, brother. - High, digging up on some sounds. - Stand up. - Man, what kinda shit is this? - Jive-ass nigga. - Move over. Over there. Move it! Okay, now turn around and put your hands on the wall. - No, man, uh-uh. Ain't gonna be no days like that. Now, if you shoot me, you're gonna have to shoot me right in my face, Mr. Black Pig. - Nigger cop. - He ain't mad at you, Ben. He's trying to do his job like anybody else. - Pointing that goddamn gun at us. Is that your job, nigga, huh? - Turn around and put your goddamn hands on the wall. - No. No, goddammit. You're a black-ass pig. - Okay, move up against the wall. Come on. - You ain't shit, man. You ain't shit. (tense militaristic music) - God. Okay, come on. Come on. Move it out, move it out. - Damn funeral, all the way to Alabama, like going to some foreign country. Kill, kill, kill, kill. (horn honking) - [Viola] George. Bobby's downstairs waiting for you. - Yeah, okay, alrighty. - [Criminal Voiceover] Black pig. (George sighs) - I ain't got time to eat. Man, I don't know why I'm working this damn overtime anyway. - 'Cause we need the money. Oh, would you stop by Fred's Market on the way home and pick up a couple of pounds of pigs' feet? - Black pig. - Yeah. When did you start buying this crap? - I didn't buy that stuff, you did. - Did you call about my ticket? - I'll pick it up today. Oh, and I put your black suit in the cleaners' too. - It's too small, Vi. - It's all you got. - Be back home about one o'clock. - Oh, will you please talk to Valerie tonight? - Yeah, well I wanna know exactly what happened between her and that boy before I say one word. - Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing? We're gonna be late. Captain Walsh is gonna shit. - Captain Walsh can kiss my black ass. Let's go. - Oh boy. - I didn't want this damn overtime anyway. - [Bobby] Nothing wrong with a little OT. Besides, I can use the bread. - [George] Yeah. (exciting music) So, Julie wants more money, huh? - Oh yeah. - She wants more money. - That's what the thing is, you know? That's what chicks are all about, I guess. Money, money, money. - You'll never get it. You'll never get it as a cop. - I'm aware of that. - What are you gonna do? - That's what overtime's all about. - Never make it with overtime, baby. Take a bribe. Take a bribe like the big boys do. - [Bobby] Who's coming here today? - [George] A couple of fat guys from the War Department. - [Bobby] What guys from the War Department? - [George] Davy Crockett and the Lone Ranger. (children shouting) - [Bobby] What are we doing out here? - [George] Working overtime. (dreamy tense music) - [Walsh] Hello, Discovery I. This is Russell Walsh, Houston. Do you read me, Bobby? Over. - [Bobby] Loud and clear as a bell, Houston. - [Walsh] Okay, Bobby. George, do you read me? George, do you read me? Over. Discovery, this is Houston. We're not getting any signal from George. Please recycle 214, over. - [Bobby] Hello, Houston, this is Bobby. I'm looking for a place to plant the flag. It seems real soft here. - [Walsh] Sure, just like you had, Bobby, over. - [Bobby] We landed pretty close to a crater. I'd like to explore it later if we can fit it into our timeline. - [Walsh] Was that George, huh? I can't make out what you're saying. You're fairly audible. George. - [George] Damn, it's just a little ball hanging in the middle of nowhere. - [Walsh] Okay, Georgie, we hear you loud and clear, over. - [Bobby] Here it is, the US flag. - [Walsh] Do my eyes deceive me? Is that flag upside down? - [George] Hope they remembered to put some film in the camera. - [Bobby] Okay, George, ready to pose for my moon portrait. - [George] Okay, move over there, Bobby. Let's get a good framing here. Yeah, a little further away, good, good. Okay, now salute. There you go. Good, good. Damn, Bobby, don't you know how to salute yet? - [Walsh] If you guys are finished, maybe we can get some rocks. - [George] Okay. Man, move over a little bit. Yeah, closer, closer. Good. Good. Okay. Come on, Bobby, stand up straight. - [Bobby] Look what the little lady sent us in case we got hungry, huh? (Bobby laughs) Look at that. - What you got there, man? - It's a hot dog. - [Walsh] Come on, get on with it. - [Bobby] What do I do? Anybody looking, George? - [Walsh] Yeah, me, I'm looking, all the way from Houston. - Here goes. - Don't throw that crap on the moon like that, Bobby. Damn, Bobby, I can't take you anywhere with me. Come on, take my picture. - [Walsh] Wow, that's what we want. - [Bobby] Hey, Houston, what about that crater? - [Walsh] Roger, Bobby, if we have time. George, George, this is Russell Walsh, when are we gonna hear from you? Over. - [Bobby] What's the matter, George, you're not talking to them down there? - [George] Oh come on, just take the camera and take my picture. - [Bobby] Watch out for the crater, George. Don't go swimming. - [George] Hey hey hey hey, I'm falling, I'm falling. - Watch out for the flag. - [George] To hell with the flag, man, I'm falling. - [Walsh] What the hell's going on up there? - George, are you all right, George? - [George] Yeah yeah yeah, I'm all right. Get me up from here, you maniac, dammit. - [Walsh] Come on, George, pick yourself up. - Help. I need some help out here. - Get some foremen in here right away. Sons of bitches, they messed it up again. Can you believe it? Everything okay? Any injuries? Make a notation, that the flagpole should be redesigned to withstand the shock of a man falling. - Sir. - What? - I don't have a pencil. I don't have a pencil. - You don't have a pencil? George, how you been? Look, the hose is standing by. You better go and get checked out right away. It's been a long day, man. Work here has been excellent. Look, we'll check this lot out later after you fellas have rested, huh? What do you mean you don't have a pencil? You're my secretary. You're supposed to take important notes for me. - Mother. - Sorry. Sorry. - How come you snatched the goddamn flagpole out of my hand? - It was falling on the ground, dirt. - What? - I'm sorry. But don't worry, it won't happen again when it's the real thing. - Bobby, this is the real thing. (tense music) - [Walsh] And again, I must say, let me make one thing perfectly clear... - [Vendor] Nice to have our boys serving the country like this. - Hey, man, I'm gonna go relax in the car. - You can't do that, Walsh is coming down here. - Bobby, I can do any goddamn thing I want. (children shouting) - I hear the exam for sergeant's coming up again soon. You gonna take it? - No, man. - Why not, what do you got to lose? You might get lucky. You might hit it this time. - Man, I don't wanna be anybody's goddamn sergeant. Not anymore. - Come on, why don't you play the game? Maybe they're ready for you. - Man, these people got a lot to get together before they're gonna be ready for me. Man, you know they don't want us to make it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Look at those examinations. - Yeah, I know, the exams are full of crap. - Yeah. That asshole captain of ours, how in the hell did a dumb bastard like him become a captain? - Well, he knows how to play the game. He's got his nose in the right place. He knows how to kiss ass. - No shit, now you hit the nail right on top of the head. You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. - I'm going. Hold up. (dog barking) (man shouts) (dramatic tones) Drop it. You drop that knife. - You got this under control? - Yeah, I got it, you all right? - Yeah, but the guy back there's bleeding like a pig. - Handcuff him. (dramatic tones) - You're gonna have to kill me, nigga. - Drop that knife, drop it. (gun clicks) Son of a bitch.

Big-bellied, bad breath son of a bitch. - I'll tell you something, George, I'm glad he told me. That's right, because you wasn't gonna tell me and I could see something was wrong and I didn't know-- - Bob, my man. Thank you very much for thinking. But I'm fine, I'm just fine. - Split? - Man, you know I don't play that cheap shit no more. - Oh, Mr. Goody Two Shoes, huh? Man, I ain't looking to make nothing on this goddamn police department. - Your ass. - Here, take it for the funeral. How much time you taking off? - I'm not taking any. Look, find a restaurant along here, let's get something to eat. I'm hungry like a goddamn champ. - Wait a minute, look at this, look at this. Huh? Look at that, huh? Hm? Look at that. Huh? - Yeah, that bitch of yours is good for something, ain't she? - Yeah, you leave my old lady out of this. She gives good head and she makes a fantastic meatball sandwich. Mm. - That's all you need? - Damn right. (ominous music) - Valerie, how many times do I got to tell you to lock the front door? As long as I'm here, there's something I wanna talk to you about. Now, your mother was telling me about you and that Fernandez kid. And I want the truth. I wanna know what happened in that garage. Valerie, are you listening to me? - Yes, Daddy. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm just tired. - Tired from what? - [Valerie] School. - Did you take something? - No, Daddy. - What did you take? What did you-- - Nothing. - Give me that. - Some pills. (tense music) - How many did you take? Why? Where'd you get 'em from? - Two. - Okay, I want you to take your clothes off and go to bed and go to sleep. Pills. Pills, why? - What difference does it make? You don't care what I do anyway. Daddy. I'm sorry. (tense music) (funky music) - I'm gonna fix this so you won't be dealing for awhile, baby. You need more, baby, you need more? - Black stinking nigger bastard. You're gonna have to do more than you're doing. You think you won, nigger? (dealer spits) (cackles) - Okay, mother. - What the hell's the matter with you, Lattimer? Are you crazy or something? You can't go around beating up on a citizen like that. - I can do any goddamn thing I want. - Like hell you can. - He was pushing dope. - So what? Wasn't in my precinct. Lattimer. How's the hand? - It's fine. - Well, go and get it checked out. You need some time, take it, take all the time you need. You're a good cop, George. Don't go louse everything up just because your mother died. You're looking for trouble, Lattimer, you're gonna find it, believe me. Do you wanna get rid of that goddamn badge? You will. We'll have it off of you. - You see, I have this friend who works at the White House and his name is Richard and he's a janitor and I promised him, he's a very good friend, and I promised him that if I made it to the Moon, that I would name the lunar module after him, Richard. - Listen, one at a time, please. You, sir. - Yes, Captain Lattimer. How were you selected to be one of the first men to go to the Moon? - Well, I was in desperate need of a job and I got to the unemployment office and there was a bulletin for Manpower Incorporated. I filled out the application and after that, it was all very easy. And I always liked to fly anyway. - What are the greatest fears that come with being an astronaut? - Only one. The very prominent fear that maybe we are not wanted out there with our human debris. - Captain Lattimer, what has the training for the flight been like? - Isolation. Isolation. Sort of like waiting at the mailbox for your welfare check, you know what I mean? - [Female Reporter] What else? - What else, what else, reflections, reflections. Double reflections. It hurts your eyes, sort of makes you blind. - [Reporter] What do you hope to find on the Moon? - Some dirt and some rocks and anything that'll tell us about the Moon, you know? - Captain Lattimer, why do the scientists need this information? - Well, to be perfectly honest, I don't know. But I guess they know. At least, I hope they know. Do you suppose maybe they don't know? I mean, I don't know. I know the other astronauts don't know. Do you know? Do you know? - Captain Lattimer. - Yes? - Soon, you'll be traveling a quarter of a million miles in space to reach the Moon, what will you be doing in space? I mean, what will you and your fellow astronauts be thinking about on your long, long journey into outer space? - What was that question again? Look, I've been waiting for 45 minutes and I-- - Someone will be with you in a minute. - Look, I just want to get an X-ray. Can't you call upstairs and arrange it? - I told you, you'll have to wait your turn. - Now wait a minute now-- - Now, you look here. I've already told you twice. But I'll see if I can get someone if you'll just bear with me. (tense music) (doctors chattering) - It's okay, fellas, I'm the flight director, Russell Walsh. How is he? - [Nurse] He's been sleeping for the last hour. - [Walsh] Oh, what are his vital signs? - [Nurse] Normal. - I want an hourly check made for the next 24 hours. - Yes, sir, Mr. Walsh. - George, how you feeling? - Fine, fine, just fine. - [Walsh] You gave us all a scare, man. - Just wanted to find out whether or not you cared. - The medical staff all agree you did not sustain any injuries whatsoever. We still want you to stay overnight for observations. As far as we know, there's been no leak to the press about your accident and we'd like to keep it that way. - I bailed out of that limb. At least one whole minute before it exploded. There was no indication of a malfunction at the controls. But I heard a voice. - A voice? - I heard a voice. It kept saying to me, "Get out of this machine. "Get out of this machine." - No kidding. Well, let's just be thankful you're not hurt and the flight will get off on schedule. Meanwhile (chuckles) you rest, huh? Now, anything you want or need, all you gotta do is ask. Boy, I've gotta run. Press briefing in 15 minutes. I'll stop by and see you first thing in the morning. Oh and, George, please don't fall out of bed, George. I want to run for Congress next year. Bye, see you in the morning. (whimsical tones) - Nurse. - Yes, sir? - I was feeling a bit hungry. I'd like to order something to eat. - Certainly, sir, what would you like? - A couple of apples. Oranges. Tomatoes. Grapefruit. Crackers. Unsalted. And some barbecue chicken. - Barbecue chicken? Will that be all, sir? - I was had a little itch here. - Yes, sir. - Take off your uniform, lieutenant. - Yes, sir. I have forgotten to order your food, sir. - I won't be needing that food right now. What's your name? - Bulemay Swenson. - Bulemay Swenson? - Bulemay Swenson, yes. - Forgotten country, lieutenant? - [Swenson] No, sir, forgotten Bulemay Swenson. (tires screeching) - What the hell are you trying to do, huh? What, are you trying to kill me, you black bastard? You know how fast you were going? You were going about 70 miles. Don't shake your head at me, you motherfucker. Why don't you read the goddamn signs? 35 miles an hour. All your kind, you just wanna kill people. That's all it is. You got no respect for no one. Come on, come on, what, are you afraid to get out of the car? Huh? You want a little fight? I'll give you a little fight. All your kind, you got no respect. Just wanna kill people, that's all it is. What, are you a fucking cop? Why didn't you tell me you're a fucking cop? I wouldn't have said that shit to you if I knew you were a fucking cop. I'm sorry, man, I apologize. No, don't take that off. Come on, I got a kid. Come on, give me a break. - You got about five seconds to get that goddamn car out of here. - Right. - Get it out of here. - All right, okay, I'm sorry, man. How am I supposed to know? I'm getting it out, I'm getting it out. It's stalled, the son of a bitch. - Move it. - All right! I didn't know you were a goddamn cop, man. Tim? - Georgie. Georgie, my boy. - Watch that boy shit, old man. - Oh listen, boy, if you wasn't so damn big and I wasn't so damn old, I'd beat you right down to your kneecaps. Then I'd beat your goddamn kneecaps. - Okay, old man, you win, you got the power. - Georgie, Georgie, how are you? - Fine, Tim, just fine, how are you? - Oh, so damn lonely, I can hear my teeth decay. Sit down, sit down, Georgie. - What's the place like, Tim? - Oh, it's just like any other kind of prison. But I suppose it's a lot better than being all alone out there in the world. You and Walsh still at it? - Yeah. Same old crap. Yeah. Brought something for you. All the way from Kentucky. - Oh, Georgie, Georgie. That is beautiful. The only thing that makes any damn sense at all. Here, here, open it up so I can take the poison off. Now, that makes sense. Here, clean your pipes, Georgie. - No. Can't do any drinking, Tim. I got work tonight. - Still on the graveyard, huh? - Yeah. It's easier. You know what I mean. - I know what you mean. Oh, that's good bourbon. Good bourbon. - Hell, give me a drink. Captain Walsh can walk my goddamn beat tonight. (Tim chuckles) - It's not such a bad place, Tim. - Oh. - What's there to do around here all day? - Oh, there's nothing to do. All I can do is dream. That's what happens you know, Georgie, when you get old. Nobody gives a shit about the way you feel anymore. - Yeah. - I just wish I didn't have to be so scared all the time. When I was a young man, I wasn't afraid of anything. Hard to get used to being scared. Strange time of life, getting old, feeling useless, shriveling up, growing smaller. That's what happens, you know? You grow smaller and smaller until you're too small for your body. I wonder what all that means. I wonder if it means anything at all. I just wish life didn't have to be so goddamned unpleasant at the end. (dreamy tones) For a minute, I thought the bastards had found it. Open it, Georgie. It's yours, Georgie. I want you to have it. I got no use for it anymore. Catherine bought it for me a long time ago. Long after I knew I couldn't shoot a gun anymore. Well anyway, I want you to have it. - I don't need it, Tim. The one I'm carrying right here is heavy enough. - No, no, Georgie, I want you to have it. - I gotta go, Tim. - No, no, no, don't, don't, George. Stay awhile longer. - No, I gotta go, Tim. I gotta work tonight. - To hell with those sons of bitches down at the precinct, guardians of the people, goddamn executioners. 35 years of my life I gave to those sons of bitches. Do you know what they gave me, Georgie? - A wooden plaque. - Yeah, a cheap, wooden plaque. It's not worth 35 years of a man's life, is it? Is it, Georgie? - I gotta go. - No. - I gotta go. (ominous tones) (coughs) - George. The success of this mission depends upon the three of us together. - Right. - You've been at it too long, Tim. (upbeat music) (alarm buzzing) - George. Come on, George. Wake up, baby. - [George] Who the hell wants to wake up? - 7:30. Gotta get your nerves together. Come on, baby, you have to get up. Your dear wife is expecting you. Would you rather lay here all day with me instead of having to go home to old funky Viola? - Baby, I'd like to lay here all the time with you. All the time. - Get your black ass up from here and go home and go to bed. - The hell are you doing? - Just taking a picture of my man. - Here. It's all right, it's not broken. - George. - What? - I need about $15. Can you let me have it? - All I got is $12.25. - Okay. That's enough. - Talk to you later. - George. George. What are you sleeping out here for? Why don't you go in there to bed? - I wanted something cold. - Oh, do you want me to fix you something to eat? - No, I'm not hungry. - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Why don't you go to bed? You look tired. - Yeah. I guess I'll go. - Oh. I got everything ready for in the morning. Your ticket cost $110 round trip. And your black suit's back from the cleaners'. - I'm not going to the funeral, Vi. - George, you've gotta go to your mother's funeral. - I don't wanna go all the way to Alabama to be with a lot of sad people. Singing and praising the lord for all the fucking pain. (ominous tones) (wood crashing) (patriotic music) Hello. Hello. Where is everybody? It's me, George Lattimer. I've come back home. You invited me here. Is anybody here? Answer me. What's the matter with you people? Don't you realize that I've walked on the Moon? I've walked on the Moon. What have you done, you, you faceless mothers? It's me, George Lattimer. I just got back from my trip to the Moon. I was born right here in this town, right back up there on Sugar Hill Road. My dear old sweet mama still lives... Mama. Mama. Mama. (George sobs) I walked on the Moon, Mama. I walked on the Moon. (funky tribal music) - You know, you should have gone to the funeral. - Vi, I'm going to quit my job. - Nigger pig. - Nigger cop. - Mr. Goody Two Shoes. - Pass over you. - Black pig. - Nigger. - Damn, brother. - My man. - Some pills. - Nigger bastard. - Black bastard. - You crazy. - Come on. Why don't you go to bed? We'll talk about it later. After you're over this thing. - No, Vi, it's today. Right now. I'm never gonna put on a cop's uniform again. - George, you know you're just upset about your mother's funeral and of everything. - No. No, it's a lot more than just that. I'm tired of having to look at all the shit I see every time I go out there in the streets with that gun strapped to my hip. I've been living that way for 12 long-ass years. I used to really think I was gonna make it. Yeah. I had me some plans. 12 years as a flat-footed cop, for what? No more uniforms. I ain't going out there to fight the man's war no more. - How can you just not go to work? You have a family and you've got to think about your family. - I'll make it. I'll get another job. - Doing what, George? I want a home for us. It takes money. - Viola, don't you understand that I don't give a fuck about the money anymore? Can't you see I'm trying to change our lives? Man, the old way is bullshit. I don't wanna live that way anymore. Vi, I know people out there who hate me because I'm a cop. You know what that feels like? I put on this uniform and I go out there in the streets, the people look at me and they hate me. - That's because you're a mean, selfish man. You don't give a damn about nobody but yourself. - Now, what the hell is that supposed to mean? - I got two children in there that I have to take care of. Oh, I know you don't give a damn about 'em. - I care about my kids. You're goddamn wrong to say I don't care about my kids. - And if you leave them hanging like you left me hanging for 12 long years-- - Yeah, but I've been taking pretty good care of you too, haven't I? Who in the hell you think has been paying the bills around here? - I hope you pay for every painful moment you've ever given me. - Viola, goddammit, you can kiss my ass. Man, you haven't listened to not even one word I said to you since the day we met. - George, you never said anything worth listening to. - Man, I'm getting the flick outta here. - You never said anything, George. Damn you, you never said anything. (ominous dreamy tones) (dramatic percussive music) (tires squealing) - Fathers have died. Mothers have been broken. Babies have cried. No man can be a slave. No man can be a judge. No man can justify the taking of another man's life.

Hey, man. - Yeah? - You know anything about unidentified flying objects? - You mean flying saucers? - Yeah. - Well, I know a lot of people believe in them. A lot of important people. You believe in 'em? - Yeah, I believe in 'em. You? - Yeah, why not? - You think they trying to come down here? - I don't know. - I don't know why the hell they wanna come down here. I tell you one thing though, if they do come down here, they better not land in the good old U.S. of A. - Yeah, why not? - They'd get wiped out. - Come on, what are you talking about, they'll get wiped out? How do you know what they're gonna bring with 'em? They could have anything. Laser beams, underwater devices, invisible soldiers. Get wiped out. - Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, look here. America can wipe out anything. - Hey, you hear that? Don't come down here. (Bobby laughs) Don't come down here. - Don't come down here. - We got Richard Nixon down here. - We got Agnew, the golfing giant. - Don't come down here. - Look here, come on, let's take a little walk. - I don't wanna walk.
