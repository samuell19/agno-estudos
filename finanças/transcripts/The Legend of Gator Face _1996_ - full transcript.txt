BEEN A PART OF THIS TOWN SINCE... WELL... SINCE I WAS A BOY ABOUT YOUR SIZE. ( chuckles ) I CAN REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. ESPECIALLY THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE PEOPLE WHENEVER THOSE TWO WORDS WERE UTTERED-- "GATOR FACE"-- AND THEY LOOK LIKE THEIR BLOOD JUST RUN COLD. HEH HEH HEH. YOU KNOW MY FATHER WAS THE ONLY MAN EVER TO SEE HIM UP CLOSE? PART MAN... PART ALLIGATOR. THAT'S WHAT HE IS. A... WILD BEAST OF PREY, CONFUSED WITH HUMAN THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS. MYSTERIOUS. AN INCREDIBLE CREATION OF NATURE. COVERED FROM HEAD TO TOE WITH SHIMMERING GREEN SCALES. HAD DAZZLING BLUE EYES, ALMOST HUMANLIKE, BUT HE HAD THE HEAD AND FACE OF A LIZARD. HE SAID HE WAS BEAUTIFUL, GRACEFUL-- ALMOST GENTLEMANLY. MUST BE THE MOST UNIQUE AND INCREDIBLE CREATION ON GOD'S EARTH. AND I HAVE SPENT THE BETTER PART OF 50 YEARS RIGHT HERE IN THIS SWAMP, AND I'VE NEVER, EVER HAD A GLIMPSE OF HIM. NOT EVEN ONCE. BUT I KNOW HE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, IN THE HEART OF THIS SWAMP, ALL ALONE... IN THE HEART OF THIS SWAMP, ALL ALONE... WELL, IT'S BEST YOU BOYS GET GOIN' HOME, ISN'T IT? HMM?

YEAH, MAN, THAT'S JUST LIKE MY OLDER BROTHER CHIP. USED TO TELL ME ALL THESE GATOR FACE STORIES AND TRY AND SCARE ME. LIKE WHAT? WELL, LIKE, HE COULD CRUSH YOUR BRAIN OUT OF YOUR HEAD WITH ONE HAND. AND HE'S GOT THESE LASERS THAT COME OUT OF HIS EYE AND, LIKE, BURN A HOLE IN YOUR HEART. ( chuckles nervously ) YEAH, SO, UH, IT'S KINDA LATE, MAN. HOW'RE YOU GONNA GET PAST YOUR FOLKS?

NOW, I KNOW VERNON IS NOT THE ENTERTAINMENT CAPITAL OF THE WORLD, BUT I'VE GOT THE MAYOR AND HIS WIFE BREATHIN' DOWN MY NECK ENOUGH THIS SUMMER WITHOUT HAVING TO HEAR ABOUT YOU AND YOUR BUDDY PHIL GETTIN' INTO TROUBLE-- PULLIN' FIRE ALARMS AND MAKIN' PRANK CALLS AND FILLIN' THE TOWN FOUNTAIN WITH BUBBLE BATH. Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M GETTIN' AT HERE, RIGHT? REMEMBER, I'M THE SHERIFF. YEAH. YEAH. JUST TRY AND ENTERTAIN YOURSELVES THIS SUMMER WITHOUT GETTIN' ME INTO TROUBLE. ( sighs ) I'LL TRY MY BEST. ( glass clinks ) ( dog whimpers ) SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'S FUNNY, I GUESS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU GUESS? I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST... IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS THE OLD DAYS. LIKE, REMEMBER LAST CHRISTMAS WHEN WE STOLE THE BABY JESUS FROM MS. CRABTREE'S LAWN AND WE LEFT THAT RANSOM NOTE? THAT WAS A PRANK WITH SOME THOUGHT BEHIND IT. YEAH, THAT WAS MY THOUGHT. ALL YOU WANTED TO DO WAS PUT SUNGLASSES ON THE WISE MEN. WELL... WELL, YOU'RE A THINKER. I'M JUST THE ACTION MAN. I DON'T KNOW, IT-- ( scoffs ) IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF GOOD THINGS TO DO. PHIL, IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF SUMMER. I'M JUST GETTIN' WARMED UP. I'LL HAVE SOME KILLERS BY THIS WEEKEND. ( dog barks ) OH, MY GOD. MY LAUNDRY! UH-OH. LET'S GET OUTTA HERE. YOU DUMB DOG-- COME ON! GIVE IT-- GIVE IT-- GIVE IT BACK TO ME! COME ON. WHOA! OH, IT'S SO HOT.

HI, BOYS. HEY, SKEETER. CAUGHT ANYTHING YET? I'M NOT FISHIN'. "SOUR APPLES WARD OFF BADNESS FROM HE WHO CASTS THEM INTO THE ROAD." OH, RIGHT. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? I BEEN TOLD. ARE YOU SURE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN LIED TO? WHEN BADNESS IS CONCERNED, ONE DOES NOT TAKE CHANCES. RIGHT, EMMETT? THAT'S RIGHT. WHATEVER YOU SAY, SKEETER. ( laughs ) MAYBE YOU BETTER WAIT OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE, PHIL. THE MAYOR AND HIS WIFE ARE IN THERE BUYIN' SOME MEAT. WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE UNPUNISHED YOUNG MAN WHO THREW A ROCK THROUGH MY WINDOW LAST SUMMER. NOW THAT SCHOOL'S OUT AGAIN, I ASSUME WE CAN EXPECT MORE OF THE SAME FROM YOU AGAIN? WELL, IF YOU CAN ASSUME THAT IT WAS I WHO THREW A ROCK THROUGH YOUR WINDOW, I CAN ASSUME THAT YOU'LL BE ASSUMING ANYTHING. YOU WATCH YOURSELF, MR. SMART-MOUTH! YOU ARE TALKING TO THE MAYOR'S WIFE. I'M GONNA BE WATCHING YOU THIS SUMMER. AND DON'T YOU FORGET, I HAVE A DIRECT LINE TO YOUR DADDY. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THE SHERIFF OF VERNON LETS HIS SON TURN OUT AS UNDISCIPLINED AS YOU. BOTH OF YOU NEED TO SPEND LESS TIME HANGING AROUND THAT CRAZY OLD HERMIT IN THE SWAMP. HEY, BOB IS NOT CRAZY. DON'T YOU TALK BACK TO ME. HE IS A FILTHY, CERTIFIABLE OLD FOOL. I HAVE HALF A MIND TO HAVE HIM LEGALLY COMMITTED. ( dog barks ) HEY, PETE. ( whimpers ) HEY, YOU'RE HURTING HIM. THERE IS NO COLLAR ON THIS DOG. BECAUSE IT'S PETE. PETE DOESN'T LIKE COLLARS.

MY LIFE WON'T BE COMPLETE UNTIL THAT DAY. MY LIFE WON'T BE COMPLETE UNTIL THAT DAY. YOU SAID WE WEREN'T GONNA END UP HERE TODAY, REMEMBER? MM-HMM. HEY, UH, I-- I HAD ANOTHER DREAM LAST NIGHT. ABOUT GREEN SPACE MUTANTS. FIRST, THESE HUGE SHIPS, RIGHT? CAME FLYING OUT OF THE SKY, STARTED BLOWING UP EVERYTHING IN TOWN, RIGHT? THEN THE MAYOR'S WIFE COMES OUT IN THE STREET AND SHE GOES, "HELP ME! HELP ME! ALIENS!" RIGHT? AND THEN ONE OF THESE SHIPS CAME DOWN-- BOOM! BOOM! HIT HER RIGHT IN THE HEAD, DROVE HER INTO THE GROUND LIKE A NAIL. MAN, YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST DREAMS. ALL I EVER DREAM ABOUT IS FULLY-CLOTHED GIRLS IN THE SHOWER.

WHATEVER IT WAS, IT'S PROBABLY STILL OUT THERE. NOW, TONIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA BE DEPUTIES, WHICH MEANS YOU GOT THE LAW BEHIND YOUR OWN BEST INSTINCTS. IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN SHOOT AT WHATEVER MOVES. NOW, LET'S BE CAREFUL OUT THERE AND LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER. LET'S GET ON WITH THIS SO WE CAN GET HOME AT A DECENT HOUR. MY WIFE'S GONNA HAVE A COW IF I'M OUT PAST 12:00 TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL SIGHTINGS OF SOME SORT OF ALLIGATOR THAT WALKS UPRIGHT LIKE A MAN. THE LEGEND OF WHAT TOWNSPEOPLE CALL "GATOR FACE" HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER FIVE DECADES, SINCE THE FIRST REPORTED SIGHTING OF THE CREATURE BACK IN 1942. MANY THEN BELIEVED THERE ACTUALLY WAS A GATOR FACE, ALTHOUGH HE WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN UNTIL THIS WEEK. WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED ON ANY FURTHER SIGHTINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR. Man: IN NATIONAL NEWS... WE MADE THE NEWS. THIS COULD KEEP US OCCUPIED ALL SUMMER. THINK ABOUT IT-- CAREFULLY STAGED APPEARANCES EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. WHEN PEOPLE GET TIRED OF LOOKING, GATOR FACE WILL MAGICALLY REAPPEAR AGAIN. LET'S NOT GET TOO CRAZY, NOW. LET'S NOT GET TOO CRAZY, NOW. ( dog barks ) ( barks ) WHO'S OUT THERE? RARR! AAHH!

YEAH, COME ON, SHERIFF, LET'S GET IT UP. WE'RE READY, WILLING, AND ABLE. YEAH, WE CAN DO IT, SHERIFF! YOU KNOW THE MAYOR'S OUT OF CONTROL, SHERIFF. WE'RE DEPENDIN' ON YOU. COME ON, SHERIFF. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. YAH-HAH! ALL RIGHT! DANNY WOODMAN? YEAH? I'M COMMANDER REESE. I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU. DANNY WOODMAN. SO, YOU'RE THE LEGENDARY GATOR FACE WRESTLER. ( sighs ) MAN, THAT MUST'VE BEEN AN INCREDIBLY FRIGHTENING ORDEAL. NO? YOU GONNA TELL ME THAT YOU WEREN'T AFRAID FOR YOUR LIFE WRESTLIN' A SEVEN-FOOT SWAMP MONSTER? ( clears throat ) YEAH, I GUESS. YEAH, I GUESS. YOU KNOW, THAT-- THAT SURE IS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT OUTSIDE. YOU KNOW, I-- I BET VERNON HAS NEVER BEEN AS EXCITING AS IT IS TODAY. I MEAN, TV CAMERAS AND REPORTERS EVERYWHERE-- YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S WATCHIN' THIS LITTLE TOWN, WAITIN' FOR THE NEXT APPEARANCE. YOU KNOW, I-- I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN MYSELF, DANNY. SOMETIMES IT WAS SO BORING, I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA EXPLODE IF SOMETHING DIDN'T HAPPEN. ME AND MY FRIENDS, WE USED TO MAKE UP CRAZY STORIES, JUST TO SHAKE THINGS UP A LITTLE. YOU EVER THINK LIKE THAT? SOMETIMES. YEAH. YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM IS, SOMETIMES BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, A SMALL STORY CAN GET WAY OUTTA CONTROL AND BECOME A SERIOUS MATTER WITH VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME, SON? I-- I DON'T KNOW. I'M GONNA LEVEL WITH YOU HERE, DANNY. I'M IN CHARGE OF THIS OPERATION HERE. IT'S MY JOB TO FIND ANSWERS TO MYSTERIES LIKE THIS. I GOT RADAR EQUIPMENT THAT'S STATE OF THE ART. IT CAN BULLSEYE A MOUSE IN A FOOTBALL FIELD. IF THAT CREATURE'S IN THAT SWAMP, I'M GONNA FIND IT, AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME TO MAKE MY JOB EASIER, I SUGGEST YOU TELL ME RIGHT NOW. THAT'S ALL. YOU'RE FREE TO GO. THERE'S MY ANGEL. NOTHING GOOD ON TV? NO. WHO WAS THAT BOY WHO WAS JUST IN HERE? NOBODY YOU NEED TO BE CONCERNED WITH. I THINK HE'S TROUBLE. I WANT YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM, OKAY? OKAY. CAN I GO WALK AROUND A LITTLE? ( chuckles ) SURE. I GUESS I CAN'T KEEP YOU COOPED UP ALL DAY. THANKS, DADDY. YOU TAKE CARE, NOW. I WILL! CHECK THIS OUT. PHIL, I GOTTA DESTROY THAT SUIT TONIGHT, MAN. WHY? SOME KINDA GOVERNMENT AGENCY JUST QUESTIONED ME. MAN, I THINK THEY'RE ON TO US! ( whispers ) I'M SERIOUS. ( scoffs ) LIGHTEN UP. THEY GOT NOTHING ON US. I GOTTA MAKE ANOTHER RUN. NO! THERE'S A BIGGER ISSUE HERE, PHIL. HE'S REALLY OUT THERE. ( sighs ) NOT THIS AGAIN. I MEAN... YOU USED TO BE FUN TO BE AROUND. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, MAN? WHOA, I'M OUTTA HERE. DANNY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON? OH, NOTHIN', DAD. UH, JUST HAD A LITTLE ARGUMENT, THAT'S ALL. THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT. CHIP SAYS HE SAW YOU GET HAULED OF BY COMMANDER REESE. YOU WANNA TELL ME ABOUT THAT? WELL, UM, COMMANDER REESE WAS JUST, UH-- JUST-- JUST WANTED TO KNOW THE BEST ROUTES AROUND TOWN, THAT'S ALL. THE NATIONAL GUARD DOES NOT HAUL 12-YEAR-OLD BOYS OFF THE STREET TO ASK DIRECTIONS. NOW WHAT AREN'T YOU TELLIN' ME? NOTHIN', DAD, I SWEAR. COME ON, SHERIFF, WE'RE LOSIN' DAYLIGHT. COME ON, SHERIFF, LET'S GO. LET'S GET TRUCKIN'. I WANT YOU HOME EARLY TONIGHT. YES, SIR. ( engine starts ) SO... YOU'RE THE ONE WHO FOUGHT OFF GATOR FACE. EXCUSE ME? MY DAD SAYS I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK TO YOU. HE SAYS YOU'RE TROUBLE. WELL, WHAT'D YOU DO? UH, I DON'T KNOW. SURE YOU DON'T. SO... THIS IS VERNON. TOOK SOME WORK, BUT I FINALLY GOT HERE. WHERE'D YOU COME FROM? BLUE FALLS. I SORTA... CHARMED MY DAD INTO BRINGING ME. MY FRIENDS ARE GONNA HATE ME. EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET A LOOK AT GATOR FACE. WHOA, DOES EVERYBODY BELIEVE THAT THE CREATURE'S REAL? SOME DO, SOME DON'T. I'M NOT SURE YET, MYSELF. IT'S EITHER REAL OR THE BEST HOAX EVER PULLED. EITHER WAY, THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE. WHY? YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT? NO-- WELL, YEAH, JUST WHAT'S ON THE NEWS, THOUGH. ( chuckles nervously ) YEAH. ( knocks ) HEY, BOB. HEY, SHERIFF. WE, UH-- WE NEED YOUR HELP. YEAH, I FIGURED YOU WOULD. ( chuckles ) WELL, YOU KNOW THE-- YOU KNOW THE SWAMP BETTER THAN ANYBODY. WELL, IF YOU WANT MY HELP, YOU HAVE TO DO IT MY WAY... AND THAT MEANS NO GUNS. HOW WE GONNA CATCH HIM WITHOUT GUNS? WILL YOU LOOK AT Y'ALL? FOAMIN' AT THE MOUTH. READY TO GO OUT THERE AND KILL YOURSELF A GATOR FACE. HE'S A MONSTER. WELL, WHATEVER HE IS, HE'S MANAGED TO STAY UNSEEN BY THE HUMAN RACE FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG. AND Y'ALL JUST GONNA STUMBLE OUT THERE IN THAT SWAMP WITH A BUNCH OF SHOTGUNS AND CATCH HIM. ( laughs ) HEY, WE'LL GET HIM, ALL RIGHT. YEAH. YEAH? YOU'RE ON HIS TURF. THIS SWAMP HAS BEEN HERE FOR OVER A THOUSAND YEARS. LONG BEFORE WE CAME HERE. AND IT'S GONNA BE HERE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS MORE LONG AFTER WE'RE GONE. AND HE'LL STILL BE HERE, 'CAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO SURVIVE. HE KNOWS HOW TO HEAL HIMSELF. ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'VE FORGOTTEN, OR GOTTEN NUMB TO-- I MEAN, IF YOU CUT OFF A LIZARD'S TAIL, IT GROWS RIGHT BACK. YOU BURN DOWN A FOREST, SOMEHOW IT MANAGES TO REGROW ITSELF. NATURE'S BALANCE IS PRECISE AND POWERFUL. AND HE'S A PART OF THAT BALANCE. SO, IT'S JUST A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE CALL HIM THE MONSTER. ALL RIGHT, NOW, I DO HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO BRING HIM IN. AND I'LL HELP YOU CATCH HIM. BUT ONLY IF IT'S TO SAVE HIM. THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR GUNS HERE... AND DO WHAT I SAY. AW, THIS BABY OUGHTA HAVE SOME STOPPIN' POWER. LET'S SEE YOU TANGLE WITH ME NOW, LIZARD. POW! HAH. THAT CREATURE'S MINE. ( men chatter ) NOW, THIS IS YOUR SLIGHTLY OVERRIPE OCEAN FLOUNDER. IF HE'S GOT ANY GATOR BLOOD IN HIM, HE'LL GO FOR THIS. BOY, YOU TOSS ONE OF THESE IN A POOL FULL OF GATORS AND THEY GO NUTS! ( soldier laughs ) YOU BOYS HAVIN' A FISH PARTY? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR GUNS? YOU LOSE 'EM ALREADY? WE DON'T NEED NO GUNS. WE'LL CAPTURE THAT CREATURE BEFORE YOU EVEN FIND YOUR WAY OUTTA THIS SWAMP. ANY OF Y'ALL CARE TO... ( cocks gun ) MAKE A LITTLE WAGER ON THAT? YEAH, I'LL BET YOU $50 YOU'LL GET SOME GATOR DUNG ON THOSE SHINY NEW BOOTS BEFORE I SAY "JEHOSHAPHAT." ( men laugh ) I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, BOB. YOU BETTER BE RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, COME ON, GUYS, WE GOT 20 MORE OF THESE. SO, BEFORE THIS TOWN BECAME THE BIG HOTSPOT, WHAT'D YOU GUYS DO AROUND HERE FOR FUN, ANYWAY? MOSTLY JUST TRIED TO CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIKE IT HERE. WHAT'D YOU DO IN BLUE FALLS? PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING. ONCE, I PUT TOOTHPASTE ON THE BOYS' TOILET SEATS. I PULLED THAT ONE OFF PRETTY EASY. UH... WHAT? IF YOU WRESTLED GATOR FACE, HOW COME YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SCRATCHES OR BRUISES OR ANYTHING? WELL, HE WAS WET, AND I-- YOU'RE LYING. YOU NEVER SAW HIM. NO, NO, I'M NOT LYING. I REALLY SAW HIM. LOOK, HE'S OUT THERE, AND I'M AFRAID THEY'RE GONNA KILL HIM. HE'S NOT A MONSTER LIKE EVERYONE THINKS. HE'S INCREDIBLE. SOME KIND OF... WONDER OF NATURE. YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, DO YOU? I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE THE KEY TO ALL OF THIS-- WHETHER YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH OR YOU'RE JUST PLAIN LYING. THIS WHOLE THING HAD TO DO WITH YOU. I'M GONNA BE WATCHING YOU. WELL, ANYWAY, I GOTTA HEAD BACK. THERE'S A CURFEW TONIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW, DANNY WOODMAN. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW, DANNY WOODMAN. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SECTOR 14, GO HOT. 14, GO HOT. ( beeps ) PERFECT. 19-- SECTOR 19, GO HOT. LET'S LIGHT IT UP. ( beeps ) ( laughs ) MERRY CHRISTMAS. MY, GOD, THE WHOLE TOWN IS WIRED. MOM? MM-HMM? WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'LL DO IF THEY CATCH HIM? I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING-- IF THEY DO FIND A GATOR FACE, THEY'LL KILL HIM FOR SURE. ( people chatter ) HOT DELI SAUSAGES MADE FROM THE FINEST INGREDIENTS. THE BEST IN TOWN. THERE YOU GO. HELP YOURSELF TO SOME MUSTARD AND RELISH THERE. Chip: HE'S TIRING, AND I'M STARING UP AT HIM, AND THE MOMENT IS CAUGHT. SO THEN I STAGGERED HIM WITH A LEFT HOOK RIGHT INTO HIS LIZARD LIPS. THAT'S THE ONE THAT SENT HIM RUNNIN'. HE WAS NEARLY SEVEN FEET TALL, TOO. MUST'VE BEEN ABOUT 300, 400 POUNDS ON HIM. OH, HE WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO TOUCH! HE GRABBED THAT DANG MARSHMALLOW STICK RIGHT OUTTA MY HAND AND LEAPT OVER THE CAMPFIRE LIKE A BIRD. WELL, I'D-- I-- I-- I'D SAY HE WAS AT LEAST, OH, EIGHT FEET TALL. THE CREATURE WAS NINE FEET TALL IF HE WAS AN INCH. I DO BELIEVE HE HAD WINGS. THERE WAS NOTHING-- THERE WAS NOTHING REMOTELY HUMAN ABOUT THIS CREATURE. HE WAS A SAVAGE BEAST WITH SHARP FANGS AND BREATH LIKE A SPOILED FISH. IT WANTED TO KILL ME, BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD, MY DOG SCARED IT RIGHT OFF, AND MY LIFE WAS SPARED. IT WOULD'VE KILLED ME. I COULD TELL. DON'T TELL MY WIFE I SAID THIS, BUT THAT DAMN CREATURE'S THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THIS TOWN. WE GONNA PULL IN A NICE CHUNK OF CHANGE FROM THE SUMMER BARBEQUE THIS YEAR. I STILL DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE THE BARBEQUE UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE WHAT'S OUT IN THAT SWAMP. DO I HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT THE BARBEQUE PROCEEDS PAY FOR BOTH OF OUR SALARIES? BESIDES, THIS HERE BARBEQUE'S THE ONE THING THESE PEOPLE LOOK FORWARD TO ALL YEAR LONG. HELL, IT'S THE ONLY THING SOME OF THEM WAKE UP FOR. NO, I CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING THAT AWAY FROM THEM NOW. NOT IN AN ELECTION YEAR. SO, YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO KEEP THIS TOWN SAFE, BUT THAT BARBEQUE GOES ON AS SCHEDULED. HEY, YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE? YEAH, I SEE IT. WHERE YOU GOIN'? GOIN' DOWN TO THE SWAMP. THE SWAMP? WHAT FOR? BECAUSE I'M GONNA GO LOOK FOR GATOR FACE. IF THEY HAVEN'T FOUND HIM WITH THEIR RADARS YET, THEN I THINK I KNOW WHERE HE IS. HE'S DOWN IN THE THICKS. ( sighs ) ARE YOU CRAZY? I MEAN, ARE YOU STILL JOKING WITH THIS, OR WHAT? I TOLD YOU, PHIL, IT'S NOT A JOKE. HE'S DOWN THERE, JUST LIKE BOB SAID. NOW HE'S ON THE RUN. AND THEY'RE GONNA FIND HIM, AND THEY ARE GONNA KILL HIM, AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT. I BROUGHT THIS WHOLE MESS HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO ABOUT IT. ALL I KNOW IS I HAVE TO FIND HIM AND TRY AND HELP HIM. LOOK, YOU CAN BELIEVE ME IF YOU WANT TO. I DON'T CARE. MAYBE YOU DID SEE SOMETHING DOWN THERE, BUT IT WAS NOT GATOR FACE. I'M GOIN' NOW, PHIL. NO! LOOK, I-- I CAME DOWN HERE 'CAUSE I WANTED TO GET THE SUIT, OKAY? NOT A CHANCE. COME ON! I WANNA MAKE ONE MORE RUN. THE WHOLE WORLD IS WAITING FOR MY NEXT APPEARANCE. IT'S A COMMAND PERFORMANCE. LET'S TRY AND GET THIS THROUGH YOUR THICK HEAD. IT'S NOT JUST A GROUP OF VERNONITES OUT THERE ANYMORE. THAT'S THE NATIONAL GUARD. Angel: THEY CAN BE OUTSMARTED. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? EAVESDROPPING. AND, UH, HOW MUCH DID YOU HEAR? RELAX. I'M NOT GONNA TURN YOU IN. BESIDES, I KNEW YOU WERE INVOLVED SINCE THE MINUTE I MET YOU. HEY, WHO'S SHE? OH, AND YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WEARS THE SUIT, RIGHT? DON'T ANSWER THAT. SHE MIGHT BE BUGGED. HER DAD'S A FED. WHAT? DON'T BE A MORON, DANNY. I'M NOT WORKING FOR MY DAD. WHAT DO YOU WANT? HMM. A PIECE OF THE ACTION. A LITTLE EXCITEMENT. OH, AND I WANNA BE THERE WHEN GATOR FACE MAKES HIS NEXT APPEARANCE. ( sighs ) GATOR FACE IS REAL. DON'T YOU GET IT? DANNY, DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY. YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE POINT HERE. I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY, AND MAYBE I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT IF I WERE YOU, EITHER, BUT HE'S REAL AND HE'S OUT THERE. AND IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING SOON, THEN THIS STUPID HOAX WE PULLED IS GONNA END UP KILLING HIM. I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. IF YOU TWO WOULD'VE SEEN HIM, YOU'D FEEL THE SAME WAY. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. FINE. COME ON, BOY WHO WEARS THE SUIT. GO AHEAD. ( sighs ) I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, AND I JUST WISH I COULD TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR THIS WHOLE MESS. I NEVER EXPECTED THAT YOU WERE REAL. I MEAN, THOSE STORIES-- THEY SOUNDED LIKE GRANDPA TALES. PROBABLY NEVER GONNA GET ANY PEACE AND QUIET NOW. THEY WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE. THEY'RE GONNA KEEP LOOKING TILL THEY FIND YOU, SO I JUST HOPE YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO STAY HIDDEN. Phil: DANNY! WE CAME TO HELP. I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE IT, BUT IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT YOU DO. WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? LET'S GO SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND. WELL, COME ON. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT. COME ON, HOW MUCH FURTHER DO YOU WANT TO GO? WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF DRY LAND. I DON'T KNOW. WE'RE GETTING CLOSE, THOUGH. HE'S GOTTA BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. AH, IT'S THICK IN HERE. WE'VE NEVER BEEN IN THIS FAR BEFORE. ( trilling sound ) ( snapping, swishing ) WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT, GUYS? I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT CAME FROM OVER THERE. GUYS, LOOK AT THE TIME. WHERE YOU GOIN'? I MEAN, WE... GOTTA BE... COME ON, GUYS. IT'S-- IT'S ONE OF THE NET TRAPS. SOMETHING'S IN THERE. ( trills ) IT'S HIM. OH, MY GOD, WHAT IS THAT? IT'S MOVING. ( trills ) HE IS REAL. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW? JUST-- JUST STAND BACK. GONNA LET HIM OUT. WHAT? NO-- ARE YOU CRAZY? JUST STAND BACK, PHIL. BUT-- BE CAREFUL. NOT A GOOD IDEA. IT'S MOVING AGAIN. ( trills ) ( gulps ) WHAT IS IT, A LIZARD? I DON'T THINK SO. NO. LOOK AT HIS EYES. HE LOOKS ALMOST HUMAN. NO, HE'S SOMETHING... SOMETHING IN-BETWEEN. DON'T-- DON'T GET TOO CLOSE. HE MIGHT BE DANGEROUS. IT'S OKAY. HE TRUSTS ME. NOBODY'S GONNA HURT YOU. WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS. ( trills ) IT'S OKAY. FRIENDS. ( trills inquisitively ) ( gunshot ) WHAT WAS THAT? SHOTGUN. PROBABLY POACHERS. OH, WHERE DID HE GO? THEY'RE GONNA KILL HIM. WHAT? JUST THINK WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF WE HADN'T HAVE FOUND HIM. IF HE GOT CAUGHT ONCE, HE CAN GET CAUGHT AGAIN. THEY DON'T WANNA KILL HIM. THEY WANNA CAPTURE HIM ALIVE AND STUDY HIM. OH, COME ON. THEN WHAT ARE ALL THOSE GUNS FOR? IF THEY FIND HIM, HE'S DEAD FOR SURE. I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO HIM. WELL, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? COME ON, TOO MUCH HAS HAPPENED. TOO MANY PEOPLE THINK THEY'VE SEEN HIM. WHAT-- WHAT IS IT? DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA? YEAH, I GOT AN IDEA. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TELL PEOPLE GATOR FACE IS A JOKE, AND THEY'LL ALL HEAD HOME. WELL, HOW DO WE DO THAT? BY TELLING THEM THIS WHOLE THING WAS A HOAX... WITHOUT LETTING THEM KNOW WHO PULLED IT. AND HOW DO YOU PLAN ON PULLING THIS OFF? ANOTHER RUN... STRAIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER BARBEQUE. WHAT?! THEY WILL EAT ME ALIVE. NOT YOU, ME. I'M THE ONE WHO STARTED THIS WHOLE MESS, SO I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO FIX IT. TOMORROW'S SUMMER BARBEQUE IS GONNA BE ONE THAT GOES DOWN IN VERNON HISTORY. ( music plays, people chatter ) ( music plays, people chatter ) YEE-HAW! HOW'S IT LOOKIN', HENDERSON? ALL CLEAR. NOT A THING IS STIRRING. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN IN THERE. I WANT HIM CAUGHT QUICKLY AND QUIETLY, UNDERSTAND? ROGER THAT. HI, HONEY. HI, SWEETIE. HAVE YOU SEEN DANNY ANYWHERE? I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HIM SINCE YESTERDAY. OH, I'M SURE HE'S JUST OUT HAVING SOME FUN WITH HIS FRIEND PHILIP. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF. ALL RIGHT, BOYS, LET'S CIRCLE AROUND ONE MORE TIME. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. COME IN, RED TWO. RED TWO. COME IN, RED TWO. ARE YOU OUT THERE? OVER. DO YOU READ ME? LOUD AND CLEAR. ARE YOU IN POSITION? OH, YEAH. WHAT A TURNOUT! LOOK AT ALL THOSE REDNECKS. CONDITIONS ARE PERFECT. RED THREE. RED THREE, ARE YOU OUT THERE? ALMOST FINISHED. HOW'S IT LOOK? BREATHTAKING. EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE SO PISSED WHEN THEY SEE IT. NOW, REMEMBER TO TAKE OFF THAT SUIT AND HEAD DOWN TO THE TRAP DOOR AND STAY HIDDEN UNTIL I GIVE YOU THE SIGNAL. JUST MAKE SURE THE CRAWLSPACE UNDER THE FLOOR IS CLEAR. IT IS. I'M GOING TO MARK A RUN NOW. I'M READY TO LEAVE. REMEMBER, EVERYBODY WAIT UNTIL MY SIGNAL. I WANNA MAKE SURE THE PARTY'S IN FULL SWING. ROGER. 10-4. ( people laughing, cheering ) HELLO, LADIES. HELLO, MARY. NOW, HOW ARE YOU FEELING? WELL, I'M FEELING A LITTLE BETTER, BUT I STILL GET THE SKIN CRAWLS BEIN' OUT AT NIGHT. BUT I AM A LITTLE LESS SHAKY NOW. GOOD. LET ME JUST SET THIS DOWN. I'M TELLING YOU, IF THAT CREATURE IS OUT THERE, HE'S WORTH GOOD MONEY ALIVE. AND I'M TELLIN' YOU THAT IF THAT CREATURE SHOWS ONE SCALE AROUND HERE, I WANT HIM SHOT DEAD ON SIGHT, CHOPPED UP, AND FED TO THE FISH. WELL, HEY! ( chuckles ) NICE TO SEE YA. THANKS FOR COMIN' OUT AND HELPIN'. ( music plays ) RED TWO, ARE YOU THERE? YEAH. POUCH-FACE JUST SAT IN MY PATH. SHE'S RIGHT BELOW ME. OH, YOU'RE KIDDING. O-- OKAY, DON'T-- DON'T PANIC. JUST STAY STILL AND BE QUIET. SHE WON'T BE THERE ALL DAY, OKAY? SHE BETTER NOT BE. WHAT THE? HOLY COW, THERE IT IS. IT'S GONNA JUMP ON THE MAYOR'S WIFE. OH, MY GOD, IT WANTS TO FINISH THE JOB. HEY!
