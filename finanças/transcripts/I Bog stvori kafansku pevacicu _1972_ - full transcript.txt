It's the seventh glass you've broken on purpose! Come here! I have as much as you ask! Don't do it! Leave me! Don't do it! Watch out! A knife! Let's go, Zivko... They fucked me up pretty well. Zivko... They've killed me! Bake... A film by Jovan Zivanovic AND GOD CREATED THE BAR SINGER "Why would I cry..." "Why would I suffer?" "I won?t be shedding any tears..." "from now on..." "My heart was enough..." "shedding tears..." "Let it at last..." "find happiness..." "How it's good..." "to be on your own..." "That's why I want..." "my life to be happy..." Can I get you something to drink, guys? Six red wines. "How it's good..." "to be on your own..." "That's why I want..." Who's the sixth wine for? "my life to be happy..." "my life to be happy..." Do you recognise me? What do you want? Singer continues to sing. She's doing her job. Nice job, very nice. One died, another one in jail. And the little girl walks on water. You slut! I say you're goddamn slut! Move! Why are you saying that? A man was killed here because of you. My friend Bake... And you did nothing, bloody nothing about that! Speak! - Leave me alone and go away! What's with your heart? Speak! What should I say? Even if I said something, you wouldn't understand, poor soul. What? What? You're getting drunk here, competing over to whom I should sing. And who asks me about anything? Do something, they'll kick her ass! You said this morning: "You're paid, so you have to sing!" So I sing! C'mon... Which song do you want, you rat? Pay upfront and I'll sing to you for a whole year. C'mon! Hit! Are you better now? Go to hell! Stop! I want to get out! Stop! - Leave me alone! Are you crazy? The whole transport company is chasing us! You want me to stop? - Wait! Don't! You need to go somewhere. Where? - How do I know? Anywhere. Home... Where is my home? Then change the bar. It's not that easy... - I have a good friend. She has the same job as you. Her name is Luna. What's yours? Bela Seka. - Bela Seka? Oh, nice. Wait. Bella means pretty in Italian. Pretty. Bela Seka. Bella! Bella! Bellissima! You are really pretty, you know. Are you a musician? - No, no. I am not... I'm a painter and arranger. Damjan Ilic. Good friends call me Damjan "Nuclear". You can call me that. You can do whatever you like. How much will this rescue cost? I don't have any money... - Don't be tasteless. I'm an artist. How could I ask anything from you? We are colleagues of sorts. Where does your friend work? - In Djerdap. You know where it is? - Yes. It's raining money there. And she's allergic to water... - Don't joke. I'm serious. 4,000 workers. They are not roadside vagabonds. Engineers, technicians, fitters, experts,... Would you like to sing for them? Would they want me to? Seka... I've already told you. Damjan Nuclear will fix it. But remember. A singer belongs to everyone, and no-one. From now on, don't attach yourself to anyone. I never did... They attached to me... That's that Ratomir Jovanic from the White Hill. He's an electrician for the dam. They demolish out of spite. Bastard! I would show him... if I had a gun! What are they doing to you? Curse the Devil! He has already cursed himself. You have called me... I wanted to ask you: how long are you planning to act like this? What? You're all over the place. Here, there and everywhere. I've heard you have mined the church now. - Nobody else wanted to. But why do you have to do it? Are you a dogcatcher or an electrician? From which school did you graduate anyway? - And what was I to do? Was I to let the sludge block the dam? Was I?! Attention, attention! Water is penetrating... Attention! Recall all groups that are 40 meters below water level... Go to the pumps urgently! Warning for the machine technicians: Prepare for evacuation. Go to the pumps. Attention! Recall all groups that are 40 meters below water level... This one here! Turn off the generators! Water is entering the cabin! What the...? How come that water breached today, when we were having an overhaul? If we don't send them supplies, they'll drown like rats. Or worse... I've heard we don't have power yet again, huh? - Yeah. What are they doing there, in distribution? - Fuckin' around... What? What do you want? Colleagues, I'm in a hurry! Easy bro... - Don't mess around. Can't you see he's transporting fresh fish? What have you been drinking, you idiots? What are you waiting for? What do you want? Move on! - I'm moving. What are you waiting...? This is not a pool, I'll fuck you with my tool! Keep close. They're here. Come. Warm up a bit. What? I'll be right back. Colleagues! Hello. Oh, when did you return? Hello. What's happening? - Don't ask. I'll tell you later... Tell me, where's the boss. What for? - I want to introduce this kid to him. She sings pop hits. Ah, there he is. I'll be back. /Nice chick... How's her singing?/ Miso, hello. - Hello, Damjan. What's this? Where are the customers? - Don't ask. It's the third night like this. Why? - Because of the dam, the water. Tonight will be better, I hope. Miso, I want to introduce to you our artist... Change your clothes... Can you help me? Are you still afraid? It's nothing. Some guy in Krusevac wanted to cut out my eyes. And in Senta they smeared me with tar. They did many awful things... I endured it all. They think that's what we are for... Why are you so quiet? What else are we supposed to do if we are only good for singing in bars. Have a shot... Fuck this life without rakia. Does it hurt? Everything will be fine. You just need to stick to your own repertoire. "Tonight! For the saviours of Djerdap performs a new singer! Bela Seka!" "It's forbidden to pinch the performer" "Let this night give you everything that I want to give to you..." "Let this night mean to you everything that my life means to me..." "When it comes to an end..." "All words are pure lies..." "They mean nothing now..." "When it comes to an end..." "Give me your hand..." "This night I'll go with another, you'll be just a memory...!" "What once was, it's gone now..." What is this? The chief of the trade union is also here. Fuck it. This one is prettier... "When it comes to an end..." "All words are pure lies..." "They mean nothing now..." "When it comes to an end..." "Give me your hand..." "This night I'll go with another, you'll be just a memory...!" "What once was, it's gone now..." "What once was, it's gone now..." Please... No sleep tonight. You'll be on watch to make sure nothing breaks. Enough of this! I'm paying for all the music requests. - Stop joking. It's my turn now. The bar was empty for 3 days. Don't make a mess now. - I'm not making a mess. Am I paying honestly? Move. Is he a resident bully? He's showing off because of you. He did the same when I came. You don't have enough money to afford this! Give me a drum roll. I'll find the keys to her... And now... for the saviours of the dam... Bela Seka! Don't. Leave me, you fool. What's this? You're drunk. "No, no... Don't take off your wedding ring..." "Let it stay..." - Ah, fuck it... It's my turn now... "Our old love, dearest one..." Brother, I'm sorry. They're provoking... "Dear one, old love..." "Why don't you love me...?" They're provoking... "Why don't you want me...?" It's over now... How? They're waiting for you in the backyard. Me? - Yes. "Guilty is the heart that's crazy in love..." C'mon. Who's waiting for me? You know... What is it? - They called for you to come outside. Who? - Some pals of yours. Me? "They'll remember your friendship..." "...because my heart's wounded name left written on the ring..." "...because my heart's wounded name left written on the ring..." "Why don't you love me...?" "Why don't you want me...?" "Why do you hurt me...?" "I'm guilty, my heart is guilty..." "...that's loving crazily..." "I wonder at night, my face is pale..." "Everybody says: here's drunkard...!" "From bar to bar, wandering..." "But why's nobody asking...?" Come now, look... Fucking shit, this has been like an earthquake... Oh, you animals... - Come here... I'll call the boys... "Give me, people, one more glass..." "to ease the pain with wine..." "Give me, people, one more glass..." "to ease the pain with wine..." Hey! How's it going? Who's this? - One from the... Stay calm. Should we block all exits? Park the trucks. Let me see... Let's get in. "I don't have anybody no more..." "The bar is my home..." "Give me one more glass..." "To ease the pain with wine..." "Give me one more glass..." "To ease the pain with wine..." Can I get you something? Your boss. He should come here. If we don't choose the right song, there will be a mess in here... You have called... Where is he? - Who? You know very well... I know nothing. Whose trucks are parked out front? State's. Why do you ask? I'm asking who's driving. Why do you want to know? They cannot park like that. Then write a ticket. Don't bother us with it. Okay. If this is what you want... It is... We'll see. Kid, run! Fellas, what are you doing? We're having a party. - Why? Is that forbidden? Weapon! Hey, guys! I gave you some for the bar. This is for the kitchen. - Okay. How about all this shattered glass? Have they paid for what they broke? No. - Don't worry about it. I'll clear it with the main office. Be careful! Hey. - Hm? Why didn't you let me take my clothes off? Hm? - I don't know... Men like it. Maybe you're not a man... Why are you laughing? They wouldn't stop the other girl. If you wanted... I didn't want to... I had to... - Why? You charmed us like snakes... I've heard he even broke some mirrors. They all did. - You too? Attention, attention! To the Tower: prepare for runway number 5. No, no. If they don't come by morning, we will do it ourselves. We'll send Ratko. He's Jovanic. They say he can... Only he accepted. Is he afraid? I'll ask him. All clear. I'll stay. Goodbye. Boss is asking if you are afraid. - What can I do? Please, send someone for a dry suit... C'mon, what are you waiting for? He's completely crazy! It's a job for experts! - The divers won't be here before evening. So? - Ratko knows the river from his childhood. Which river? This is not the Danube you two peed in! Only a fool would get himself into this! What's Seka doing with this loser? What does this have to do with you? I thought she was smart. And what's wrong with her? - Huh... I wanted to make out of her what I couldn't out of you... because of that rakia of yours. She doesn't need this old rowdy. He's not a rowdy, nor is he old. He's a real man. He'll give her an illegitimate child... and I would give her a career. Don't! Are you crazy? Seka! Do you hear me? I can hear you! What's that? Sweater! What's the name of this place? - Vratna! Heh... Now I also got... What? You... I worked on that dam so much that I forgot about these things... It's not "things". I gave up on it... You expect too much... I'm fed up with love. I'll get an apartment soon. In Kladovo. The building is almost finished. Hey, Tomo! - What? Do you know where Rale is? Don't have a clue. They are looking for him at the dam. He didn't show up for duty and the fuses broke down. Fuck it. In this country, things break down all the time. My tire has also broken down... He'll get into trouble... He's chasing that new birdie... maybe he's learning to sing. Have you been to Brodarac's? - Yes, he wasn't there. Distribution board went the fuck down. Nine phases burned out. And where were you? Chasing whores, weren't you? What? What are you staring at? The woman I was with is not that. Remember that, Lalic. But you are guilty. - Yes, I am. I've been working hard for 4 years. I have earned the right to fuck up once. Don't yell at me. I'm not your servant. Comrade Lalic, engineer Basaric is calling for you. Wait a moment. Listen, you, who are not my servant... What you have done until now, you did because you wanted to. Nobody asked you... So it doesn't count. You've gone too far. I've been telling you for 4 years. Don't stick your nose everywhere. Your father died for one country, and you want to die for the dam. Who will say "thanks" for that? Hm? - I didn't ask for it. "Sutjeska" 5 meters ahead, to the red line. I don't know what you asked for. I only know what you got. That award they gave you... There will be no one to put it on your grave. Now they'll take the apartment from you. And because of who? You didn't find anything better than a bar singer... Do not speak about that... What? You want to tell me what I can and can't say? Now you will be able to trash bars and fight the police. You'll have company. You can't act like that... He's your uncle. He raised you. He gave you an education, put bread in your hands. And you? What about me? It's time for you to think about yourself. To build a home. You have a single mother. You left her in the village, alone, to work on an estate. Like a lone wolf... For example... Why don't you get married? You don't have to think about it. I've decided. It's over. - You're crazy. The wedding has to be on Sunday. - But how am I ready for it? Don't worry... You'll be a good housewife. - You don't need one... Just be ready on Sunday. I want you to be pretty. I'm going to work. Where are you taking me? - I told you that Ratko is waiting for you. Where? - You'll see. C'mon baby. Come with us. Where's Ratko? You said he'd be waiting for me here. - No, he's not. Come with us. You'll see. Where are you taking me? You'll see. Tell them it's fixed! Over! Okay! You wanted to catch Ratko, didn't you? Take that coat off, it'll get wet! Easy there. Easy now... What are you...? Let me go. Let me go... Let me go! Are you crazy? Police! Police! We'll send you into space a little... Tighten it... Lift it up! Let me go! You're gonna pay for this! Screw you... Let me! I'm going to steer it. I'm going to... Bastard! You'll regret this! - Pull up, Tomo! It's going up... Right now... You need to cool off a little... I'll bring her down, okay? Don't mess with people you can't handle! Screw you, you bastard... You're gonna pay for it... Hey! Anyone?! Police! Help! Maybe he made them do it. They are all the same. I know them all... Drink a little. You'll get a cold. - I can't. I can't. I'm a doctor for things like this. I was dunked into the Morava twice. Once into Porec River. I endured it all. Oh, Miki, Miki... Damn you, my love.. Oh, Miki, Miki... Damn you, my love.. You are crying for nothing. Right now, he's joking about it. They are all animals. Animals, I say. Bear with it. You have to... With her? I love her. That's most important. - Never. Old Mother... Until now, we've always understood each other well. From now on, we won't any more. Hit the road. If you do it, don't come back. "I don't have anybody now..." "The bar loves another now..." "Give me one more glass..." "To ease the pain with wine..." "Give me one more..." What's this? "...glass..." "To ease the pain with wine..." "Give me one more glass..." "To ease..." Put on your clothes... "I'm not well..." "My soul searches for peace..." "Let everyone leave me alone..." "I don't drink..." Get out! I've had enough of you! Who is this man? Call the police! Calm down! You have a wedding tomorrow. "My green rosemary..." "My tasselled window..." "I will leave you soon..." "And go far away..." "I will leave you soon..." "And go far away..." All right, people, do you know what time it is? What are you waiting for? - Come here. Listen... Okay. Let the guests in. But... clean the tables first. Don't bill them for leftovers. - I'll have to if I don't sell it. You don't have to. Let's make a check. "I won't cry nor say anything..." "All the words are dying in my throat..." "And tears in my eyes, let them be..." "Let them dry in the fire of pain..." "I loved, loved... I kissed, kissed..." "What does it matter now...?" "I loved honestly, I kissed honestly..." "So don't cry, my heart..." So, that's my daughter-in-law...? We have to get to know each other. I'm the groom's uncle. Real uncle. The most real uncle. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too! C'mon groom. Order us some drinks. To celebrate this acquaintance. To drink a round, me and my daughter-in-law. Thank you, but I don't drink. That is nice. If you're not drinking, you could sing me a song. So I can go home... And cheer up the aunt. Tell her that I met our daughter-in-law. C'mon, don't make me beg. C'mon. Good. Which song do you want? Come back. You know this one? We have that song... "Little Gypsy..." - I don't know that one. Wait. You'll learn it. - Leave me be, you fool. You don't want... I'll show you then... How it's to be sung. Dear guests.... I had the great pleasure here tonight... of meeting my daughter-in-law... that is, your bar singer, Bela Seka! I asked her to sing a cheerful song for me. She couldn't do it. So I'll do it. I'll show her how it's sung. "Little Gypsy walks through water, slowly, slowly, like this!..." "Little Gypsy washes her breasts, slowly, slowly, like this!..." "Like this..." "In every way..." "Watch out kid, it could end like this, like this..." "In every..." You idiot... Hey! Captain! Did he hear me? - I don't know... Call him. Hey! C'mon! Quick! How do I look? I have a feeling that we'll find a place here. I shouldn't have worn this. My tits are completely covered. Excuse me, Miss. Have you asked for our boss? - Yes, I have. He's over there. - Thank you. Excuse me. Hello. - Hello. I come for the job offer... Please, come in. Can I get you something? - One rakia, please! No, thanks... Gin for me. - And beer for me too. Have you ever worked before? - Yes, here's my employment record book. Bela Seka? That's my stage name. You're an experienced artist... We saw your advertisement. So we came... What's in your repertoire, colleague? He's not a singer... He's my husband. You're married? Yes. We've had a married singer before... Try the Peasant's Shoe... Return it. You see? They don't want a married singer. So, you don't need me. What are you saying? What would I do without you? I'm just saying. What are we going to do? - I thought we might just not tell them. What? That we're married. Play it. Play... Give me one more rakia. You're in a bad mood all the time. Don't drink so much. Everything is gonna be fine. Do you want me to sing to you? "I don't know when..." "I don't know where..." "I don't know with whom you went away..." "Let it be known to everyone..." "My bad dream passed away..." "Every word..." "Pure lie..." "But..." "As a memory..." "Take this night..." "At least for yourself..." "Tell her no..." "Put a mask of happiness on your face..." Look at her... - Is that Bela Seka? "Tell her lies..." She prettified herself a bit... "Let her know..." "That past love was..." "But after me you won't find happiness..." "Remember that, while you are hugging her..." "Put a mask of happiness on your face..." "And lie to her this night..." "And this night..." "Lie to her..." Seka, come here! Seka... Come. Sit with us... Has she forgotten us? Come, Seka, keep us company. Sit here. Sit with us. - What are you doing here? Long story... We were passing by. These are my friends. Grab a chair. Sit. We barely recognised you, kitty. Make up and clothes really make a difference. You look perfect. Have you thrown up lately? You're funny as hell. I got married. - To whom? This is my husband. We have an arrangement here together. Are you kidding us or is he really your husband? Why? Can't I get married? You can but it's a pity. Why is it a pity? It's a pity... What should we do with him tonight? Do you have many friends like that? Don't make it hard for me. I lived as best I could. Now I'm with you and it's different. Help me. My uncle was right. You are all... - Don't! Leave him be, you don't know him. I can joke a little. He's watching over her like a cock over his hen. Now you'll see what I'm going to do to him. C'mon, music. You've had enough rest. Work a little. "Accordion, don't play..." "Pain, don't touch me..." "Don't remind me of those happy days..." "Accordion, don't play... Pain, don't touch me..." "Don't remind me of the days in that bar..." Oh, Seka... Kitten! "Hoping in vain..." "Dreaming in vain..." "Heart suffering for nothing..." "My Seka got married..." "She won't be coming back..." "Accordion, don't play, Pain, don't touch me..." "Don't remind me of the days in that bar..." Enough. Put it down. Okay, okay. I'll put it down. The lady sings beautifully. But she cannot entertain us as she should... Because here's her... Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu... sband! Where will we go now? - We'll see. You shouldn't have got involved. I would have fixed him myself. Whose wires are these? Mine. Is something wrong? - Sure is. I can't get through. Fuck your wires! What happened? Nothing. Sleep. C'mon. Wait a moment. - I won't! I'll find a job if you can't. And me? - What about you? You'll be at home, giving birth to babies. C'mon. Wait... Who knows... We love each other now... But tomorrow... I have to think about myself... I'm telling you... We don't have to say we're married. It'll work out. I know how it goes. I'll manage it... Leave it to me. People here are nice. You'll see. You know what... I think we Montenegrins are real gentlemen, unique. Hey! Me? Yes, you there. Let me introduce you. This is your sound engineer. You see how much we care? He's a real specialist. Excuse me, I have a rehearsal. A world class lady. Real class. Why does he bother you? - He's around you all the time. Oh, c'mon. We're fine here. Guys, what's happening? We had a meeting. And you supposedly know what meetings are all about... We have to serve them drinks. We can get you anything for drinks, but the kitchen is closed. Nevermind the kitchen, we've heard you have a new singer! Let us see her. Bring her. Call her, call her. Leave that to me! And go wake up Miss Seka. Seka who, boss? What "Seka who", you idiot? Our new singer! She's in her room. Have you called Seka? - No. How's that? I knocked on the door. Nobody answered. She's probably sleeping. I know it's late but you have to do it. Seka! She's not there. Where is she? The sound engineer's place. What? That new guy, who manages the cables. What's she doing there? I didn't ask. But she's there. Why are you jealous? Who's knocking? - Open! Who's there? - Director! What do you want? - Where is Seka? How would I know? - Listen, you! This is a hotel! Not a whorehouse! Open! I'll call the police! You can call the fire brigade if you want... Why don't you report things like this to me? It's not my job... Don't make a mess again, please! You needed me. - Not you, but Seka. What for? Where were you? It's none of your business where she was. It's a private matter. I'm not asking you. There are no "private matters" here. And why do you interfere at all? You're fired! Fired! - What for? Why am I fired? For immorality. What immorality, you idiot! That's my wife! That's my wife! Do I have the right to sleep with my wife? What is this fool talking about? Seka... You didn't mention it... It's not fair... Tomorrow morning, you'll get paid. Okay, Director. Maybe that's for the best. Listen, that is for the best. I have been successful, so there will be a place for her. You've got your job. Do you need money for the train? No more bars! You're an artist, remember it! The start is the most important here, there should be no mistakes. It's all on you now... Rest up... And then... Damjan Nuclear clears the road, and you follow in my tracks. Radio... TV... Albums... Concerts... Posters... Money! Luckily, he got smart at the last second. He'll be reaccepted into the trade union. No one does it better than him. No one carries the load better than him. I bought some beer. Do you want it? No, I don't drink. I thought you liked it... Do you want more beans? - No, no... Now you only have to marry. What's with the albums? And radio...? I've been watching you... You are very pretty... And your singing is not bad at all... But somehow, we didn't make it... I don't understand it... Where did we make a mistake? It doesn't matter... C'mon. I'm going to work... "I don't know when, I don't know where..." "I don't know with whom did you leave..." "Let it be known to everyone..." "My bad dream has passed away..." "Every word..." "Pure lies...." "Take this evening as a memory..." "Tell her no, at least for yourself..." "Put on a mask of happiness..." "Lie to her this night..." Directed by Jovan Zivanovic
