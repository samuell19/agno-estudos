So, uh... The department of corrections has sent over your papers, and, um... You're going to start with us today, which is great. And I'm not sure if they told you, but you're going to be doing a lot of dirty work, and, uh... The clothes that you're wearing really aren't appropriate, do you have other clothes that you can bring? No problem, no problem. So we pour the mop bucket out right here. So you're going to wring it just by squeezing it. There you go. Try to get all the water out of the mop, because it's a really heavy mop. Jeez. Yeah? Okay. Okay, and you take this thing off by just lifting it straight up. Perfect. And just pour it out. So when we fill up the bucket again, we have to use this medical grade disinfectant. And we're only going to use 25 mls of this because it's really strong. Just right in the bucket? Yup, just spritz it right in there. And we put that in before the water so it mixes up really nice. Okay. And this stuff to make it smell pretty. Oh. How much? You're good. - That's good? - Yup, that's good. Okay. So, the purpose of today, our goal is to one, provide education on safe driving and the effect of alcohol and other drugs, to provide education on the harm associated with substances, and developing a plan or strategy to avoid a future occurrence. So how did you get here today? I do not have your specific details. I don't know why you are here today, other than... You've either been charged or convicted with a driving while impaired offence, or you have an administrative licence suspension. So how do you get your licence back? The first step, you're completing today, you're already doing, the education program. What're you doing? What have you got? You're not going to bite me? No? Wait a minute, just wait. Wait. Careful. Do you like to be cuddled? Do you like to be cuddled? You're so pretty. Well, you're welcome. Yes, you're welcome. You're so pretty. What's he saying? Huh? What's he saying? Hello? Hello, Melissa? Hi. Hi, it's Donna, is Julia there please? No, she's not here. Oh. Well, do you know if she'll be back soon? Donna, she's not here, you should leave. Well, you're not my daughter, and I'd like her to phone me please, can you make sure she phones her mother? I think you should leave her alone. I'm hanging up now. Well make sure she gets the message please, I need her to call... Come here, come here. No, you've got to wear this. You have to wear this. There you go, no, come here, you've got to weary this, no, you have to wear this. That's a girl. What a good girl. She's watching the screen. So this is her bladder there. So we're just going to... we're just going to go around a little bit and see if we see any puppies. We're looking for a heart beat. So we've just come up on the first fetus there, so we can see that there's a heart beat. You're going to be a mommy! Wow. Come here. There you go. You're so sweet. Come on, Charlie. Look, come here buddy. There you go. What a good boy. Yummy? Just wait. Just wait a minute. I've got more. There you go. Donna, it's one of the worst parts of our job when we have to euthanize a dog which is near the end of their life. But it's something we have to do and we have to deal with it. And we just can't have you taking home every dog that we need to euthanize. I understand, but Charlie and I have a connection. He came right up to me when I started and it will only be this one time. It's good of you, but the fact of the matter is, you know, Charlie is sick, and there's high vet bills, and you have limited resources as far as I know. How are you going to cover those vet bills? Well, Crystal mentioned that there's a program for older dogs, senior dogs, and it looks after the veterinarian costs, and everything. The palliative care program. But that's generally for dogs that are older, like Charlie, but are in much better shape. Charlie is really near the end of his life and to extend his life may not be the right thing for us. I think it would be good for him. And I think he deserves a chance. So Charlie's got a couple of health concerns that we're going to have to talk about today, okay? So he's got a grade six out of six heart murmur, and he's in heart failure, he's in congestive heart failure, okay? He's also got some severe skin issues that we're going to have to send you home with medicine for. I'm going to go over each of these medications, okay, with you. He's going to be on antibiotics. These antibiotics are one full tablet every 12 hours and there's two weeks worth in there. That's going to help with the crusting and infection in his skin. He's also going to go on medicated shampoo. So this medicated shampoo you're going to lather up really well, work it into his coat, right to the skin, leave it on for five to ten minutes and then rinse it really well. And get him nice and dry, no moisture left behind, okay? So you're going to do that basically every day until his skin is looking better. He's got an ear infection. He's got bacteria and yeast in his ears. Oh, Charlie, come on. Come on, you need to eat. Look, eat. There you go. What a good boy. What a good boy! Yes you are! Yes, yummy yummy. It's okay, it's almost done. So this is the first time that alcohol has caused you problems in your life than with the driving while impaired charge, then? Yes, yes, big problems. Has there been a time that people have been upset with your drinking? Well, yeah, my daughter doesn't like it when I drink. Okay, so there's been conflict in the family because of your use, then? Yeah, yeah. It sounds like you care about your family. Oh, I love my daughter, love her. She's my heart, you know, she's my only baby. So yeah, she's important. Come here, Charlie come here. Charlie, come here, come here. Oh, that's my boy. How was your day? How was your day? I missed you. What's that? What's that? Wait a minute, what's that? Charlie, did you pee? It's okay, buddy. It's okay, it's okay, don't worry. Go pee, come on, let's go pee. It's cold. Oh! Look at you! Oh, come here. It's okay, it's okay. Hi. It's okay. Oh, you're cold. You're cold. It's okay. I know, just wait. There you go. It's okay. Let go, let go. There you go. Oh, hi, hi! Please... Yes, I know... Oops! Oh look, you like that. The stress test showed us an abnormality, and that's why we had to go to the dye test. And it showed us some minor abnormalities in the arteries of your heart. These are the major arteries of your heart, and you can see that it's got some lumps and bumps, it's not a clean tube all the way down. Down here, it gets narrow. It's about 60%. Usually we don't fix arteries until they're more than 70%. So it just means that again, we have to be very vigilant about exercise, diet, and appropriate therapies to lower your cholesterol in particular. So I think with all this information, the best thing for you to do to live as long as possible, and as well as possible, is to go to a cardiac rehabilitation program. Cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation. You'll go through 12 weeks of exercise and nutrition training... Charlie, what did you do? And you had to walk through it, didn't you? What a good boy. Charlie, come here. Come here, baby. Come here, good boy. Come here, let's go. What a good boy you are. Okay, you be patient, okay? Here's your tail. Yes, just wait. No, you get the treats after, okay? You get those after. Sorry buddy, but you've got to wear these. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know. Look, look, here. Look, there you go. Here, here. See, that wasn't so bad. Charlie. Charlie. You're my sweetheart. I love you. Charlie, I love you. What a good girl. It's just... It's wonderful. She's a good mom. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Look at that nose, look at that nose. I know, got to eat your supper. I know. What a good boy. We're going home. You're coming with me. Hey Charlie, look. Mommy's got a friend for you. Mommy got a friend for you. Yes I did. Look, I think it's great that you care for these animals but the fact of the matter is I have to know that you can take care of this cat properly and that this will be the last time that you take an animal home from here, are we clear about that? I'm very serious about this because I could easily call your probation officer and arrange for you to do other community service. Do I need to do that? No, no, the call's not necessary, I understand exactly what you're saying. Okay, Donna, this is the second part of the investigation, the ultrasound or the echo, and this is to see if we can actually find the origin of the murmur that we heard. Oh, look at this, Charlie. Look. You're not very amused, are you? Look, what do you think? No? Fine. But I know a cat will like that. Oh look. What do you think, blue or black? Blue's your colour. Look at this guy. Good boy, good boy. Hold on. There you go, good boy. It's okay, look, I made you a house. Yes, you're going in your house. You ready? You ready? Look, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't be so impatient. And you use this bit, we don't need to use this bit because we don't need it to be like smooth or anything. But just file off all the sharp pieces on preferably all these bones if you have the time. Think you can do that? Oh yeah. Awesome. You have fun. Thank you. No problem. Alright, we're going to start it up and see how he handles it. I'm going to keep my hand on him to make sure he's comfortable. There we go, oh, you're a superstar. You're a superstar. Charlie, look at you. There we go. Charlie, look at you. There we go. He's a superstar! Now how does this help their legs and that? Well, the buoyancy of the water is going to make it a little easier for him to move his legs forward, so he's going to be able to actually use the muscles a lot easier, and it's a lot easier on his joints. Oh, okay. These could be emotions, these could be a situation or an environment that you're in, where a craving is more of like a physical sensation. Has there been any time since the last time we've seen each other that you experienced a trigger or a craving? Oh, I guess, probably around supper time or bed time I used to have a glass of wine. And it just, you know, made me feel great, or you know, happy, it lifted my mood. And relax, it let me relax so that I could fall asleep. So that I guess would be... I don't know if that's a trigger or a craving, but it's probably... oh, I don't know. It's just I miss my glass of wine. It kind of calms everything down. She's so cute. We talked about her being diabetic, right? Yeah, yeah. So here's the supplies. Okay, yeah. You have to inject her behind the scruff of the neck twice a day. Yeah, okay, no problem. Pretty girl. Okay, so you know that, here you go. Aren't you a pretty girl? Look, you want some treats? Look, look, see? Look at those, huh? Now I'm sorry but I've got to give you your medicine, okay? I'm sorry. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Don't move. Good girl. Good girl, just wait. What a good girl. Yes. Now you'll feel better. All right folks, welcome to cardiac rehab. So we're going to spend the next hour going through our exercise portion of the program. So I'm Leo, one of the physiotherapists with the team, and probably the face you'll see most times that you're here. We're going to spend the next five or ten minutes warming up with a few exercises just seated in our chair. So we're going to start with marching in our seats. So just lifting the knees, getting the arms going... always make sure you're breathing comfortably. Sometimes when we exert ourselves, we have a tendency to hold our breath. A little counterintuitive. Looks good. And check in with yourself. This is supposed to be fairly comfortable, so you don't want to be panting or breathing too hard right off the bat. Should be pretty comfortable if I asked you a question, should be pretty easy to answer. Good. We're going to switch that up, and I'm gonna get you to bring your knees and arms up a little bit higher. Using those hips a little bit more, that looks great. Excellent. Feeling good so far? Hopefully. Good. Now you're gonna take those arms there and we're gonna reach towards our knees, so a big lift up with the arms, see how much range of motion those shoulders are comfortable with. Knees come up towards your hands. Again, make sure you're breathing comfortably, take breaks if you need to. Good. Take your time with it. Shake your arms out, go back to a march. Good. Cover a little bit there, that looks great! Hello? Hello, Melissa, is Julia there please? Donna? Why are you here? Well, I'm trying to get ahold of Julia, and I don't... she's not answering her phone, and I don't know if you gave her the message I gave you. Yeah, Julia doesn't live here anymore, so... Oh. Oh, okay... Can you tell me where she's gone? No, she's living with her boyfriend now. Oh. Oh, okay, and... you don't have an address? No. I've gotta go, don't come here again. Can you give her a message that her mom wants to talk... Oh my goodness! Oh, come here. This is Bruno. Hi, Bruno! Oh my goodness, you're so cute! Yes you are. He's a really good dog. Yeah? You know, I'd keep him myself, but he doesn't get along with my huskies. Oh, okay, no problem. Oh, he likes you. Yes... Oh, aren't you cute... Aren't you cute. Think you'll fir right about there. Yep. I think you'll be fine. Just wait, Bruno. Come on. Ready bud? Look, look. Look at that. That's your new home, look at that. Yes. Bruno, go away. Hi, bud. You like that? Good, I'm glad. Whoops. Ah, shit. Come here, Charlie. Charlie, come here. Look, look. Come on, you've gotta eat some. Charlie, come here. Charlie, come here. Charlie, you're going to get sick. Here. There you go. Look, Bruno's eating it. No, this is for Charlie. Charlie needs it. I know. Charlie needs it. Charlie? Come here, bud. Come on, buddy. Yeah, he's... Charlie hasn't been feeling that well, hasn't been eating, and kinda listless, and he's just, uh... he's just not Charlie. Let's start by getting a weight on him there, to compare to his last one. So if you can just put him right on the scale. It's okay, it's okay. So he's just over 3.8 kilos, so he's down quite a bit from when you adopted him, he was around five then. So that's pretty significant weight loss. We're going to start with some lab work, and take some updated X-rays on him, and see if we can get some answers as to what's going on. Okay. All right, so I'll take him from you for now, okay? You'll be back. You're gonna be right back. Somebody looks tired. Yeah. Taking him home? Yeah, he's only a baby. Did you check with Shelley first? Hmm. Good, good. Got everything? Yep. Let's go. Excellent. Adjust it as you need to, keep your chest lifted. Nice deep breaths. There you go There you go, bud. There you go buddy. I'm not gonna... see anything, am I? No, they're all in bags. Okay, okay. Ready? Yep. There's so many! Oh. Just grab as many as you can. We have to spread them out. So you kinda have to chuck them, sadly, in the back there. Oh, okay. Come on, Donna, let's go. Oh, okay. Okay buddy. You'll be okay. Sounds like he's important to you. And he helps you manage these unpleasant emotions. Yeah, he... he means a lot to me. And that, and... I'm gonna miss him when he does go. Because... I can talk to him. I talk to him. He's... He's such a good boy. Such a good boy. I haven't had him for long, but, you know... he makes, like, the days since I got him go better... go quicker. And he loves me no matter what I do. Yep. I love him a lot. Yep, love him a lot. Hi guys. Where's Charlie? Where's Charlie? Hi, Crystal? Hi, it's Donna from work. Yeah, um... I was wondering if you could come over. Charlie's not doing very well, and I don't know what to do. I'm just... just wanted... you know. Okay. I'll see you soon? Okay, thank you, bye bye. Hi! Hi, I'm wondering if you can take Charlie and me to the vet. Yep. Okay, let's go. Okay. We need to... To look at what's best for him, and... We don't want him to suffer at all, and although it hurts for us, it's more unpleasant for him to be like this, so... I think we know what we have to do. Fine. Okay, I guess so, yeah. So, the way that this is going to work, okay, is that I'm going to take him from you for just a couple of minutes so that we can put in a port in his arm that'll give us IV access so that everything will go really smoothly. And then you can hold him and be with him until the end, okay? But I'll just take him out of the room briefly for that procedure and then I'll bring him right back, and he can be in your arms, okay? He won't feel anything? He's not going to feel any pain at all, okay? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you so much. I love you so much. Donna, when I heard what Crystal told me about your apartment and the state it was in and the animals... we just can't have that! I mean, okay... this is what we're going to do. We're going to call Animal Control, and they're gonna go and remove all the remaining animals from your apartment. It's just not safe for them, and they are our priority. And... we're going to have to let you go. You'll have to do your community service somewhere else. I mean, you know Donna, animals are our priority, their health and well-being has to come first.
