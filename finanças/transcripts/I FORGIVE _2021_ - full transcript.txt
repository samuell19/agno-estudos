In the name of Jesus, you are not gonna shoot me. [gun clicks] You think just throwing these guys in jail would be all the solution to our problems?

[breathing heavily] [indistinct chattering] [groaning] [intense electronic music] Good evening Los Angeles, I'm Athena Ramirez, KPRZ channel nine, you're watching "Special Report." Tonight, we'll be discussing a topic that's become all too familiar to Angelina's, the plague on our fair city of gang violence. [upbeat music] Mr. Beach, another shooting, another innocent bystander hurt or perhaps killed. Some Angellino's would say, "Just another day in Los Angeles." As a criminal gangs expert, I was hoping that you could help us gain some insight into the causes behind this latest wave of gang related crime and murder in our city. First, thank you for having me. I've been personal an experience and gone down this road before. I believe that it's twofold. There's a spiritual side, and then there's also a natural side. Let's first talk about the natural side. We've been plagued in our community with homes without fathers. We've been playing with joblessness. So it is a scarcity of health, support, et cetera, et cetera. And because of that, many of these gang bangers praise on our young children. [soft intense electronic music] [door closes] Ma, ma, ma. I'm leaving. Give me something from the store. I get you a ma, that's what I get you.

Actually, am trying to impress Jenny. She's fine, ain't she? Yeah, Jenny's very pretty. The look, this image it's the wrong image. You ever thought about just being you. That's kind of deep Tony. Just be you, all right. You could be a minister. [sighs] I'm not gonna be a minister, I just want you to be you, okay? Just be me, okay. And you come in this office again looking like a fool, I'm gonna send you home. No, no, no, no, don't send me home Mr. Tony. I'm gonna put the book in the box. I'm gonna take the book out the box, I work good, yeah. Book in the box, book out the box. [whispering] Yeah you. Let me show you how the book in the box. Let me show you. I do some special. We gonna put the book in the box and we're gonna take it box. That's a nice puppy. I'm sorry, we gonna take it slow. The book in the box, book out the box. Book in the box, out the box.

Yeah. Where are you going? I'm about to go chill with my friend. They waiting on me. Please tell me not them trifling fools I seen you with last week. Well, you said that last time. They're not trifling. They're not fools either at the same time. Those are friends, we chill with each other, we have fun. Don't be smart with me. Go gimme some more water. Yes ma'am. Set it down. - Next to the wine. - Next to the wine. I wanna real water, I want no tap. All right, your fall's on you. Just on you, you gonna go back and get some more. And look at me. Don't roll your little eyes on me. I don't like them boys. They look like trouble. They not trouble, they're my friends, and they look after me, and they watch over me. What you need somebody to watch over you for? And you livin here, what they taking care of you. It's not cool being outside on the streets like that. You do trifling, hand me the remote, my show coming off. I'm trifling, you wont get up and get through [indistinct]. Hurry up, hurry up. Now look, look at me. You lost parents, and I lost a daughter. I know how it feels, but you ain't going to fill that void running out in these streets with these boys. You know, you can always talk to Jesus. - Jesus. - He's always here for us. - Jesus. - Jesus. Oh, the one who didn't even help my family in the accident and left me stranded. Maybe you don't have to forgive. Now you might not understand that right now, but you gonna have to learn how to forgive. It's all right in here, but chasing after them friends of yours out there, that ain't gonna feel that void. All right, I'm done. I see you later, I'll be back. Yeah, you ain't done until I say [indistinct], you be back here at a reasonable time. All right, I see you then, am out. Many of these gang bangers preys on our young children, and because of pure pressure and loneliness and all of that, that we could talk about. Most of these guys succumb to joining gangs. The other side, I believe this is a spiritual warfare. There's something that had taken place that we have not seen, that we can't see. And because it's almost like these guys are so ignorant, they're being used, and we have this violence. And so we bring it all together, it is spiritual, and it is physical. Take care [indistinct]. What's up home boy. What's up Curse, what's cracking with you. Here you go. Whoa, this is clean homie. I can make a few dollars off of this. These kids down for their crime. Straight up. So we in? Slow down a little homie, almost. So what's next. You hard or something. Man look them laptops and stereos ain't nothing. Give us a better links so we can get in. [orchestral music] Hey, you like this chick? Yeah. Hey girl, go give young Curse a little sugar. [upbeat music] Man, you see who that was? Yeah. [upbeat music] Man you take this. [upbeat music] Man, I can't do it with that girl in that bathroom, just can't. Why you can't. 'Cause I don't got no protection. What kind of brother would I be without protection? [car engine grinding] I'm a virgin [indistinct]. [car engine grinding] No way. [upbeat music] Get down on. [gun shots] Come on let's go. [orchestral music] [indistinct] dropped my phone. Can you pick it? Yes, 'cause I bet it's not even broken, see. Look at that, battery's right in there. Thank you. [orchestral music] Do you not see me sitting here eating? About the cigarette. You already about to sit here and avoid that conversation we had last week. What, about the raise? Yeah about the raise. I told you the state's cutting all the programs. The budget is tight. Okay, when is it not tight? I know Tony but- But man, look, I don't need your buts, okay. I've been busting my back and giving my all to this company. I need this for my family. The money isn't there. The only way we can get you this raise is if we cut at the outreach program. Look man, there's gotta be a way. Look, we work in LA in a nonprofit. I do know one way. What we can do, fire some of them handicap workers. No look, do not fire the workers, okay? You're not good with that. No, I'm not good with that. God will find a way. Wait a minute, what'd you say? I said, "God will find a way." There you go with that God mess again, man. I can't even eat in peace in front of you. Oh man, I'll see you later. [orchestral music] No thank you Bishop. No, we will be glad to join your congregation. Okay, take care. We got the gig. Congrats. You know what? I'm gonna call the fellas real quick and let him know what's up. Whatever you do get back to it. Okay. [phone ringing] Stan's phone is off. That figures. I don't know what to do with that guy. It's always something. Why don't you just let him go from the group. The rest of the guys will be fine. 'Cause I don't want to. Why not? Because Stan is my friend and I don't wanna be like everybody else and just giving up on the guy. He's a good man Chris. Stan is not as dedicated as you are. Okay, so I'll do what most people do in situations like this, who cares about someone. I'll chat with em, I'll give em a call, but I'm not quitting on them okay? Okay, fine. How was work? Work is good, it's always good. [clears voice] Any word on the raise? Yeah, it's words on a raise. Well? Tony. I can't believe you the kids read this. This is really not. Tony Lenal Davis. They don't have the funding right now, Chris. Are you gonna take the other job then? No, I'm not gonna take the other job. Are you crazy? Tony, why not? Okay, look Chris, Look I'm making impact over there, okay. Not to mention if I wait a little while, funding will be coming down from the state. It'll be good, okay. Tony, money is tight, okay. The other job will pay more. You're right Chris, the other job pays more, that's great. But let's think about it, what am I really gonna be doing there? Filing paperwork? I'm making an impact at that shop. Tony. Chris, it's gonna be okay. Where are you going? I'll be at the car. [Orchestral music] Tony, what are you doing here? How man, I can't even tell you, we got the gig, but your phone is off. Money's been kind of tight, it'd be on the week though. You come on inside. Do you mind if we just chat here for a second? Yeah, what's going on? You knew what's going on man. I know your phone is off with you been missing practice. You know we got that, an empty praise coming up. I'm trying Tony out here, just got a lot going on. These bills are not paying themselves. And we all do, man. But this music we do man, this is our ministry. Tony, I pawned my guitar to keep the lights on. I know man, your wife told me, here man. Man Tony, we don't even have a deal. And it's in advance to keep you playing. Believe it or not I believe it. You got it like this? Thank you no, I don't have it like that yet. I appreciate it but I can't take this time. Hey look little man lord look, just take it man. I know something's gonna pop, okay. But in the meanwhile, I just need you to do one thing, okay. Focus on the music. Why Tony? Why you believe in me so much? I believe you just have a gift of music man and our music it reaches people. It gives them hope. Gives them faith. Right now I'm investing and you change their lives. Thank you man, I appreciate you man. Just a little too close. Thanks. [exhales deeply] Stan, you forgot something, man. No, you said "It don't have to be," But I can keep it if you want. Just put it to use. - Thanks. - Thanks Tony. [soft orchestral music] Mr. Beach, I've heard you blame everything from spiritual warfare to fatherless homes, to insecurity for gang violence. But I ask you where is personal responsibility in all this. Don't these criminals make the choice to kill, to Rob. [orchestral music] Hey, Hey, Hey. Hey. Hey, my friends need a ride. You mind if we pick him up? Anybody but Jay and Karen. It's Jay and Karen. And we go. What. You mean what? There's always something with them. Wait a minute, you're always helping out other people, but you got a problem with my friend being a little ghetto. You remember that time I was picking up from church? It ended up having to take him grocery shopping- Tony that happened one time. Chris, I end up paying for the groceries. Well just go pick 'em up. Chris, all they do is argue, I'm crooking. They are not that bad. Chris, they are that's bad. [sighs] Just go pick them out. Yes ma'am, worever you say. Thank you. [tensed electronic music] Curse what the hell y'all been at?

Chill out. That car looked like somebody from the '60s. Y'all go look over there, and you call us when you seen. Man I can't do this. What? I know you not punking out. Man, he just scared boss. Shut up. You wasn't saying all that, before you joined the [indistinct]. Now you call us when you find them or you can wait for me to call you from your grandmother's house. Before we take our frustrations out on her. Get your boy. Look, it is not that big of a deal, all right? It's a big deal. That is my best friend, what do you want me to do? Have her on the street. Well. All we're gonna do is we're gonna drop her off and that's it. We, is me. I'm driving. [Man 1] Karen, I'm not buying you another car. And stop asking. Listening that. [Woman] I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. It doesn't matter, it's not that big of a deal, okay. They're a couple, that's what they do. Door is locked, that's a sign right there. Don't let him in Tony, don't let him in Tony. Shut up. Hey Carol. Hey boom. Hey, how you guys doing? Good, how are you? You telling me it's a starter, but it's not. You know what I mean? I keep telling you it's the starter. No you not, you telling me it's the starter. Well, why don't you fix this starter? 'Cause I'm paying for your nails and there's nappy hair and all these fur coats you be wearing, thinking you fly. Don't touch me don't touch me, Jay. And it ain't that much, okay. Seriously, you need to step it up boo boo. Woman what you say? Hey, hey, hey you guys- - Gotta get her back. - Calm down a little bit. Sorry Tony. It's cool. Hey Tony, I was wondering- I'm like five minutes from your house. Right, right sure but I was wondering if maybe you could just like take a look at the car. Here we go. Because it's like on the way to the house. Karen I can fix the car tomorrow. If you could fix the car, we wouldn't be in Tony's car. Now would we? No, right. No, I don't think so. Woman. What? I'm not playing with you. Okay, okay. Tony, if you can't take a look at the car, maybe you could just like drop us off at the store, right? - Right. - It's not that bad. Huh, really? What's your car at ma'am, I'm gonna take a look at it. Okay, keep going until you hit Pasadena. When you hit Pasadena, just take like your first left or something. Man you sure about this? Yeah. Man I don't know I got a bad feeling about this man. This don't feel right. Man Shut up and do your part. Man I'm just saying, stealing CD players and robbing people for their laptops is one thing, and pulling a gun out on somebody's another. You trying to get in, huh? Don't punk out on me right now. Yeah I want in, but for protection, not like this. Well that's why we going hunting for these fool. Hunting, you hear what you're saying? Yeah. This ain't no game, this is life. He threatened me and my grandma. Man quit your whining? The set is all you got. Them fool shot Hector. Even the police gonna care about us if one of us die. You gotta get our own justice. - So what you gonna do? - Shoot me now. Are you with me? [exhales deeply] Yeah man let's get this over with man. [car door closes] [indistinct chatter] [exhales deeply] [car door closes] So, what you think it is? I couldn't even tell you right now brother. Probably starter or alternator or something. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. See this is what I'm talking about Jay. You have someone look at the car before you mess it. Nah, woman. I taught Tony how to work on cars. Hey Tony, tell her I taught you how to work on cars. Why don't you just take the women home? I have Chris picking me up when I'm done. - Cool with that. - Yeah. Okay, thank you. You going to let him walk off like it doesn't matter. What's going on. Hey woman get in the car. Thanks beb. Thank you Jesus, for this peace. [tense electronic music] [gun shots] [groaning] [gun shot] [groaning] Stop that ain't him. Come here, quick [indistinct] Punk. Man I ain't doing this. You heard what the game said. Man forget what the game said, man. [groaning] And here you go with that punk crap. Man I ain't about to do this. If you kill a man and the blood is on your hands. In the name of Jesus, you are not going to shoot me. [groaning] [breathing heavily] You let this happen to me. I heard your will. [breathing heavily] [indistinct chattering] [crying] [orchestral music] It's going to be all right. Why. Not for me to answer? Why me? Ask the Lord. There is no need to look back. I know. Let's go home. [tensed music] Detective Stoneberg. Ms. Ramirez, always a pleasure. And I can tell you mean that from the bottom of your heart. Of course. So nothing better to do on a weekday night than come out and harass us. Detective, there is nothing I'd rather be doing with my evening than keeping the good people of Los Angeles informed. Well, at least we're on the same page then. What, what's that? Oh, we're ready, okay. [Instructor] And now, your most trusted name in news KPRZ, Los Angeles changed the game. This is Athena Ramirez with KPRZ9 Los Angeles at the scene of yet another gang related shooting. Detective Stoneberg, yet another gang related shooting at this hour in the city of Los Angeles. What can you tell us about it? Well, at this point in time, we really don't have enough information to determine whether this is gang related or not. But detective isn't it true that this is retaliation for last week's blood bath between the Crips and the bloods. Again, we don't have enough information. My men are currently investigating and we will learn more as time goes on. What can you tell us about the victim detective? He's currently with paramedics being treated for his wounds. Detective, are you then confirming that the victim has in fact suffered multiple gunshot wounds as the result of a drive by shooting, and is now in critical condition fighting for his life? I think we're done here. Really, you're gonna do that to me tonight. And there you have it, Athena Ramirez, KPRZ9 Los Angeles. [drum beats] [soft orchestral music] [water rustling] [door bell rings] [orchestral music] This is Davis, Sergeant Stoneberg LAPD. I'm so sorry. No, no, no, no. - [crying] - It's all right. No. Is that right, Tim? No, five shots, 10 holes. Five enter points, five exit points. The guy nearly bled to death. Gang member? Not according to his wife, just a normal guy changing a tire. Sounds about right. It's always the wrong ones that get hurt. Doctor. I'm just saying, "It seems like the good guys are always the ones that get hurt and your drug dealers and gang bangers come in for flu shot." Just ironic. Miracles more like it. Miracle? Well, according to this, he was dead 30 minutes by the time he came in. They got him stabilized, but he is gonna in the tough road out on that coma. [beeps] Look, I looked at the chart, left leg tissue is dead. We're gonna have to amputate. [beeps] [orchestral music] ♪ In the middle of my joy ♪ ♪ In the middle of my pain ♪ ♪ In the middle of my hurt ♪ ♪ Right there in the middle of my chin ♪ ♪ When tears wrote down my face ♪ [Lord] Tony. Lord, is that you? [Lord] Good, you know my voice child. Is this heaven? [Lord] Welcome to the garden. We don't have much time, follow me. [birds chirping] [orchestral music] [dog barking] Sergeant caught this one? Not like I have much of a choice these days. So what do you think, drive by, retaliation, random? It doesn't seem like a hit. And we don't have enough casings for it to be a drive by, the casings we do have though the distance is too far from the Vic to seem personal. I don't know, initiation. Well, whatever it is, you need to close this one quick. The last thing I need is another gang war breaking out. We still haven't recovered from the last one. All right, I'll leave you to it. [dog barking] They should be personal responsibility, but however, what I'm trying to bring across to you, they also need education. When you grow up in a home without direction, without father, without properly role model, it's easy to listen to someone directing you. You don't know if it's wrong or right. And the reason why we have these gangs all over the city, most of these young people are afraid. Peer pressure, they're afraid to be by themselves. So it's easier to connect with someone in a group so they can feel secure as a security blanket, and by doing such things, these gang banger, preys on the vulnerability of our young people and which causing them now to go out and do crazy things. So I don't think that they started out wanting to be gang banger to kill or to harm or maim people. They want protection, support and because of that, it led to the next page or the next chapter of what has taking place in our community. I need to ask you some questions. No [speaks in Spanish] I'm sorry, I don't speak Spanish. Haven't I answered all of your questions. Well you have, but you haven't. I need to know why that man shot your husband. Why don't you go find a shooter and ask him. Is there any reason why anyone would want to shoot your husband? What about his former running buddies? Did he owe any money? My husband was just fixing a friend's car. Shot five times for fixing a car. Wow, maybe he was just unlucky. I'm sorry, but you want me to believe that he was just a nobody. Was a nobody. No, my husband is a man of God. What a purpose on his life? We'll watch him in bed with holes all through his body. Do you have any idea what that purpose is? God will reveal and that is not to remark. I called it as I see it, give me something. Why your husband? I don't know why God allowed for it to happen, but God will have the glory. Why don't we start with what kind of man your husband was? - Is. - I'm sorry is. Tell me about the kind of person your husband is? No drugs, no gangs, just a simple man.

The sign of the times is, they don't understand how it is on the street, like you gotta adapt. Move, adapt. Well the kids get smart every day. Man. [exhales deeply] Here we are. [upbeat music] [Lord] This path represents your life and all you have gone through. Thanks for catching me. [Lord] I've never let you out of my hands child. Why so much pain in my life? Why couldn't you be there then? [Lord] I was with you in your moments of heartache as I am now, you were never alone. No drugs, no gangs, just a simple man. [beeps] [exhales deeply] Excuse me for a second. [beeps] Tony. Don't give up on me. Don't leave me. You promise God will see us through and I believe you. Tony don't leave me. [beeps] Don't leave me. You got a whole lot on your mind, don't you? Just thinking about the doctor? I told you God is gonna see us through all this. What about the chemo? Then we get you a weave a weave. A weave. Like some lace front, and look I don't really have like some fancy scripture for you on this one, but just [indistinct], it'll be fine. So, God didn't gimme a wife just to take it away from me. Is moments like these that define her faith, maybe you just have to have faith. Faith, [indistinct] pastor told me, why me? I don't know why God chose you, okay. But when you're healed, you would know that nothing is too powerful for God. Yeah, you will be testifying in God's grace. But when you do, just don't have that weave all over the place, okay. Chemo [indistinct], but wave all, it's not cool, okay. Come here. [beeps] I believe you worked in, and I believe you, I believe it now. Come on baby 'cause I'm not leaving this hospital without you. So I'll be wearing a weave and you can be on crutches, but I'm not leaving this hospital without you. Tony please. [beeps] [exhales deeply] The blood of Jesus, from the crown of head. That souls at our feet, you will be healed. [beeps] [orchestral music] [breathing heavily] [birds chirping] [Lord] That sound is your spirit, which is in tune with the saints, follow it. [birds chirping] Lord to God, thank you Jesus. Hi I'm Dr. Jones, I'm here to check on your husband's recovery. Did I interrupt something? Just praising God for my husband's recovery. You can join me. It's against hospitals policy, sorry. At least you're in better spirits. We're gonna try to help him out of his coma. He seems to be stabilizing. That's good news. Yes, but we still have to take his leg off tomorrow. I thought you said "That would stop the bleeding." Mrs. Davis, we did, we put an extra piece of plastic in his leg to help, but it's not gonna last forever. I know this is hard, Mrs. Davis your husband could be dead. He could have just bled to death out in the hallway. Are there any other options? I interrupted you from it. [orchestral music] How's his throat? Well, we're hoping he can breathe on his own or we have to fit him for a voice box. Voice box. I accidentally cut his vocal cord. 50, 50 he'll talk again. He sings for churches for a living. Mrs. Davis however he gets out of here, it's a miracle. So the violence in our community, you would attribute to the need for protection, the need for support, help. Are you suggesting then that we should meet handguns with a helping hand. So what do you think? You think that you're throwing these guys in jail would be all the solution to our problems? [orchestral music] [beeps] You was there for me when I needed you, be here for you now. [beeps] [orchestral music] [door closes] [birds chirping] [Lord] Heaven is on the other side of this river. [Tony] It's so peaceful. [Lord] Of course, you're on holy ground son. Your life on earth is been a moment, but you will live in this peace forever. I wish Chris could see and feel this. [Lord] Tony, this is your moment of peace. Yours alone son. [birds chirping] We got her [indistinct]. No doubt, definitely hungry for real. What you got in mind? Your wife's cookies comes the first thought. My wife's cookies are always my first thought. [all laughing] That should be your last thought. That's nice though one day I hope you get something like that. 13A, 61, 13A, 61 [indistinct] for 13. You know it's work, you know what it is? What's that? It's all work. It's definitely play, but it's all work when it comes to that gang. See that's problem, I like to play. [laughing] [indistinct chattering] I get that, I get that. [indistinct chattering] We need more YMCA, we need more funding. We need all these things to help in our community and that will lower the violence. We'll not stop it, but it will lower it. When you give people direction and vision things will change. Mr. Beach, I certainly take your point about the need for intervention and support and community organizations like the YMCA and these communities. However, one can't deny putting violent offenders in jail certainly does take them off the street. And after all the United States of America is a nation of laws. I mean, wouldn't chaos reign if we didn't have respect for the rule of law, if people didn't have to do the time when they committed the crime. Well, I do respect what you say, but throwing them in jail will not solve all the problem. What I'm talking about is prevention. I'm trying to stop them before they go to prison to come out being worst. Should we just throw them away because someone made a mistake. I myself made a whole lot of mistake. Personally I shouldn't be here talking to you. I've been in jail a few times, but I'm doing great to society right now. I've reached a whole lot of people. People lives are being changed because of my change. [Tony] Lord, how do I understand? [Lord] [laughs] That's what I love about you. [Tony] What's that? [Lord] Even the disciples didn't so many questions. I'm sorry, it's just hard. There's so much pain on earth, so much evil. [Lord] Let me ask you something. If you were me, would you have different people free will? I don't know. [Lord] Tell me something, do you trust me? Yes Lord, I trust you. [Lord] Okay, it's your time yet son, I still have work for you to do. Your soul is here, but your body is still on earth. Now, I want you to give a message to my people. [indistinct chattering] - [knocking] - Yes. Oh, not a problem. It's like she doesn't see me standing right here, you know what I mean. Yes ma'am, it'd be great. It'll help me. - Excuse me. - Excuse me mess? - Yes. - Yes. Do you know where the Tony Davis room is? First door on the right. Thank you so much. - Don't forget to -. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Can I help you? Is this a Tony Davis room? [indistinct] family? Oh, help me Jesus. Brother, brother, brother, brother, brother. We are are so sorry. If you hadn't picked us up, this wouldn't have happened and- Don't say that. Oh man, Jade, you know what? I don't have your inhaler, you don't have your inhaler. Why you gonna have an asthma attack now? - It's like, it not the time. - No, Karen, it's not funny. I'm [indistinct] find out who did this and I'm gonna kill him all. Maybe you should wait outside, please. No, I'm [indistinct] go over there with my people. No, no, Tony is the toughest person you knew. You put on your jacket and you calm down- Woman I'm a man, and I need to get them fools for what they did. [indistinct] Jay, okay. "Vengeance is mind," says the Lord all right. Let God deal with that all right, please. I'ma carry his vengeance alone. That's what I'm gonna do. Come on Jake, come on. [indistinct] too much baby, you're too much. I haven't seen him act like that in a while. It's okay, Karen No, what I'm saying is he was hot, right? He saw the way he got [indistinct]- Karen really it's okay. [orchestral music] You okay? I'm sorry. [crying] [birds chirping] Lord, this message it's needed, but me father? Yes you, I want you to tell the world what you have seen. I want you to live a life, demonstrating my power and forgiveness. Wouldn't you say that jail was a kind of turning point in your life? It was in a sense, it kind of woke me up. I hate to go there, but I went back a few times, but it was a spiritual awakening that opened up my eyes that I realized I don't have to go back to jail after my spiritual awakening. So even more than your time behind bars, this spiritual awakening is what set you on the path that you're now on. Exactly, 'cause sometimes you go behind bars, you come out worse, 'cause you learn more behind bars to come out to do things outside, even worse. It's not solving the problem. Heaven on one side and earth on the other. [Lord] And do you have a choice? Chris can't do this alone. [Lord] I made her Tony. I know what she can do. Wow, what's that feeling? [Lord] That's my spirit. Lord, I'll deliver your message, just wash me in your spirit. [Lord] My son, because as your faith and willingness to serve, you will be healed. [indistinct chattering] You can stop right now, it's no choice, you can stop. - Look. - What? Look at that car. Is that the car that shot at us? I don't know. Yeah, I think it is. So? If it is call them let them do this. No, we could take them fools. We gonna be heroes. Heroes. Yeah, come on. What? Come on. [gun shots] Man that ain't him. Man quit a Punk. Man I ain't about to do this. You heard what the gang said. Man forget what the game said. I ain't about to kill no innocent man. He can go with that punk crap. Man I won't do this. If you kill this man, it's on you. In the name of Jesus, you are not gonna shoot me.

Vitals are stable. You understand what I just explained to you? You may not realize it yet, but you're a miracle. I've seen patients come in with one gunshot wound dead. You're here. Look the leg, it's gone. The muscle tissue's dead, we need to take it in the morning. I understand this isn't easy, but look you have to focus on the fact that you're alive and that's a miracle. I have some good news. If you can breathe on your own, we can take the trach out. You willing to give a try. [nodding head] All right, good. Here we go. [beeps] Tony, breathe. Tony breathe. Breathe for me, come on. Okay, you're okay. [beep accelerates] You've been through a lot today. We'll try again tomorrow. You took faith. There's a reason you're alive, focus on that. [beeps] Can you tell us a bit about this spiritual awakening that you had? Well, my spiritual awakening came because I was tired of doing wrong. Tired of being a manace to society, and I was kind of suicidal 'cause I was hurting. I was tired of selling drugs, exactly what we're talking about. But I had a spiritual awakening where I have an outer body experience, and it wakes me up, I became woke. And when I follow that direction, by changing my life, giving my life to Jesus, it brings a life changing, Profound life changing, life meant something. Loving my brothers, caring about people, it was so different. So now I live my life not trying to sell drugs, destroying people, destroying my society, destroying my community. I live a life now trying to help, not to break down but to build up. [indistinct chattering] Thank you very much. [beeps] How are you? Am good pastor, thank you. Keep your head up, keep your head up. Hey my brother, how are you? Bless you man. [exhales deeply] [beeps] Men of God. I'm glad God brought you back from the dead. I'm so glad, it got a purpose for you. You know what? Get ready to take up your bed and walk, 'cause I believe. And in one hour, one hour, we had praise and worship to do my brother, one hour. I believe it, I believe it let's believe together. I believe it, I believe. Ladies and gentlemen sorry, but visiting ours are over. Bless you, bless you. It's okay. Babe I be back, am gonna walk out to pastor. Mr. Davis, how are we doing today? I just need to get a quick look at the leg. Yes. We were scheduled to amputate this leg today, right? Yep. Well I see the scar, but this leg is completely healed. That's impossible. Can you do it again? No, this leg's alive and well. Dr. Wilson, you said "This leg was dead." I told you you were a miracle. [orchestral music] [beeps] [upbeat music] So what makes you think we're in the right spot? [exhales deeply] Like I told you, I don't know. It seems more like an initiation than a hit. There's this kid, he's trying to get in, but he's like right on the edge. Man, what makes you think this kid got anything to do with it? To tell you the truth. I'm just trusting my gut. Yep. Hold on, hold on. [tense music] That looks like him right there. Right there. [tensed music] I just think he spotted this little edge. He about to run.

[birds chirping] "It was like a movie," says this witness who would talk to us only if his identity were protected. So I was here in the park with a fam, man next thing we know we just see dude come running through the park. He hopped over the bench, one detective almost had him, but he hit him with the Heisman. So I was like, "Oh crap he almost had him," but dude was gone. I was like, "Man," his partner, he ain't know what to do 'cause they was like track stars, partner was running slow. I'm like, "Man, they ain't gonna catch dude. They ain't gonna catch dude." But the other detective was like, "Man, you ain't getting away." So next thing we know I'm like, "Man, hold on this feel like a movie," like what's going on? We looking around, we don't see no camera. So we like, "Man, this ain't a movie, this real life." Tell me about living here in this neighborhood. Growing up around here, it's a whole bunch of gang members, a whole bunch of family that's gang members. So it's rough growing up around here. It's gang activity everywhere. Every night I kicking with the fam whole bunch of gang bangers, gang members. Every once in a while we had one little high head, that like the wild eye. But a dude, a new dude, we knew he was wild. We didn't know it was like that so, he grew up rough. Family in outta jail, wasn't no man in the household to really teach him how to grow up 'cause they always gang members, and so, we knew he was going to be one that jump off the porch and always stay in trouble. It's quiet now. Hard to believe that this small Oasis of normal exists in such a volatile environment. I'm Athena Ramirez, KPRZ9 Los Angeles. [orchestral music] Hello, how are you? [beep] You have a good day. [orchestral music] [car engine grinding] [indistinct chattering] I just don't understand the mentality. People say a lot of things, people say that, "It could be this, it could be that, they wanna blame it on socials. They wanna blame it on history. They wanna say opportunity is not there." Well, this is America and the opportunity is wherever you take the chance to get it. So I don't understand, I can't understand. All I can say is that this type of behavior, the gang violence that we've been enduring in this city for decades now is, these people are animals. They're animals. They have no common decency, and this isn't a conservative view. I'm sure some liberals out there will say something different. But I firmly believe that these people, those people in those areas they are just animals. They have a total disregard for decency and humanity. I just wanna do whatever, and damn the rest of us. And I don't know what we can do. I don't know what we can do. [indistinct] hear your thoughts out there. There's a lot of stuff floating around there. So gimme a call here at [indistinct] radio [indistinct]. Let me hear. You gorra be kidding me. [exhales deeply] [car door closes] Hey, how are you doing? Fine, I'm just tryna get to the house. Sorry to hear about your son. [exhales deeply] Hear what? Haven't talked about him, two days, seems about right for him. So you don't know know. Know what? Your son was arrested two days ago at the park. He's what? He was arrested. I knew, God, I knew. I knew he was gonna end up like his no good, gang banger- Hey, hey, hey, that's your son. - You know what? - If I never see him again? God, Why, Why would he do something like that? Oh God. That is your son. You don't know. You do not know the crap that he has put me through. It doesn't matter? That is your son and he needs you now. Okay, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I cannot. Yes, you can. You can do this, you are not alone. - God. - Hey, that is your son. It doesn't matter. Brush yourself off. Give me the bag. I'm tired. - Come on. - God. We're gonna pray on this now. I don't pray. God doesn't even answer prayers. I pray, I cry, nothing changes, you know what? I'm done. God hears everyone. Especially when it comes from the heart, and God hears the tears of a praying woman. You need to change your hearts crying. Okay. It's okay. Yes, you can, come on, babe, come on now, come on. [beeps] I need you to take a breath on your own. [beeps] All right. [beep accelerates] Come on, you can do it, breathe. All right, all right, all right, all right. I got it, I got it, you're okay. Nurse we may need to keep this open. Can you just [indistinct]. [breathing heavily] [beeps] Look at me, Tony, look at me. One last chance. I need you to take a breath. [beeps] Breathe come on. Yeah. [struggling to breath] Can you say something for me? Jesus. Oh my God. Hallelujah. [laughing] [beeps] Excuse me. Yeah. I just came to say, "We found the shooters." who? This isn't the time, how'd you get in here? I'm sorry, but this man deserves to know. I don't care. What. I forgive. [beeps] [upbeat music] Hey, young brother. Well them your people. No. Oh bad what happened. Said "Dog go Shannon." So what exactly happened? What these two gangs just are killing each other. One gang shoot one, the other one retaliate. They even killed a innocent bystander. Glory to God they didn't. Oh. I was at bystander. You come to get revenge? No man, I came to forgive. Don't you think it's a little late for that? Maybe. [exhales deeply] I don't understand, you told me to forgive and use myself as a tool, I'm confused. Hey young blood, your mission is your message, but forgiveness that was for you. [upbeat music] Did you just see that homeless man? No, I saw you walk to the house but then my phone rang. [sighs] You are an amazing God. [upbeat music] But say you don't want my experience that works for me. Well, we could put simple things together, like begin. Number one, get the fear factor out. Begin to look out for your neighbors. If you can help your neighbor, help your neighbor. Don't wait till the matter get worse than you wanna help, care more, find out what's going on in your community. There's a slogan said "Each one, teach one or each one, each one. However it is, but let's try to help one another, and also let the police know what's going on in your community. Let each other work. Have your group in your own community. Let's look out, let's police your own community. Look out for one another. And we go from there. We all have to work together to make this work. ♪ Lord you are my everything ♪ ♪ Lord you are, you my everything ♪ ♪ My everything is you ♪ [orchestral music] ♪ You are my piece of mind ♪ ♪ Lord you are my piece of mind ♪ ♪ Lord you are my piece of mind ♪ ♪ My piece of mind is you ♪ Thank you Jesus for healing my body, Lord.
