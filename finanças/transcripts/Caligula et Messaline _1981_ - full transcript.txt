- It won't be long before the cool waters of tivoli spout from the fountains in Caesar's gardens - another glorious achievement for our divine ceasar hero of the battlefields. - Watch your tongue baronius. Caligula has eyes and ears everywhere. So be careful, you could lose your head. - Only the other day, he exclaimed in the circus, "I only wish that people had one head." - And he made the unfortunate one telus, maintain his promise to exchange his life for the health of his emperor. - And don't forget, he had his cousin, gemellus, tortured to death because his breath smelled of medicine. Ceasar was offended thinking he had taken it to protect himself against his emperor. And the poor man had only taken a cure for his cough. He had no chance to prove his innocence. - They say he practices incest with his own sisters. - And I've also heard it said that he wanted his favorite horse lncitatus made a senator for life. - We'd better get back to guard duty. Don't forget there's a banquet tonight at the palace. - No one else makes me feel like you do. - Why must you lie? You say the same thing to drusilla I know. She told me. - Your sister's not to be trusted. She told livilla too. - That's the reason our little sister's jealous. - She's still very young. - Perhaps, but she's developing fast. The other day I saw her masturbating your horse, -after I nominated him senator all the patrician women in Rome want to become mares. Wouldn't you like to be one? - I don't want you to go with the others anymore. I'm your mare and you're my stallion. Love me my brother, my emperor. - I drink to your health divine Caesar and your lovely sisters. - What causes you such mirth divine one? - The mere thought that I could have all these people put to death in an instant strikes me as extremely amusing. Don't you find it a hilarious idea? Let me smell your breath macronious. - I took some medicine for my throat. - You smell like a skunk. You dare to use an antidote against Caesar? Not very respectful of you. Take him away. - I meant no offense have mercy on me. - I want for macronious punished. For offending his emperor and his emperor's sisters. An unpardonable crime, have him executed. - No, I beg you, I have done nothing. - You drive me insane with desire I'll come to you tonight drusilla. - Come now, tonight we have other business to attend to. -Ohmwmw. - Do you need any help dearest sister? - Is calisto's weapon not enough to satisfy you livilla? Agrippina tells me he has more to offer than any man in the empire. - Our dear brother's stallion beats him by hand. - Only the senator can beat me. - Claudius tiberius drusus germanicus, why do you sleep? - Was only resting caligula, but call me uncle claudius. All those other, other names don't mean anything. - Aren't you ashamed roveling like that at your age? - I'm very, very tired. The destruction of carthage has worn me out. - The destruction of carthage indeed. Wear yourself out down there. - Are you enjoying yourself, sister? Halt - let me pass I have an urgent message for Caesar. Ave, where do you come from messenger? -Ave I bring news to the emperor from Germany. Let him pass. - Make way I bring news to Caesar from distant lands! It's a message for the emperor. I wonder what it could be. Make way for the imperial messenger Greetings divine emperor of all Rome. - I trust you are the bringer of good news. - Ah, with that I were, the tidings are sad. Lentulus has betrayed you during his struggle with the huns. - Go on, I would hear of it. Oh Caesar, there seems to be a plot against you. Who plots against - your sister, drusilla and - bring him wine - I'll see to it at once. Now you shall drink to my health. Curius? - At your command. - Go with the praetorian guard and arrest every member of the families of the Lentulus and lepidus together with their slaves. - Your orders will be carried out within the hour ceasar. Murder them all! Speak No. Provolonus will loosen your tongue for you. No no - you've got to turn that faster than that or I'll get angry. Now, I want the names of all those involved in the plot against our emperor or you'll be dead. - I don't care. I'll never tell you. You have no right to talk to me like this. You know who I am, I'm lepidus. First console of Rome. - Why should I care about the first console of Rome? As far as I'm concerned, you're just a filthy traitor. Faster! - He won't speak. Well it's better, his loss is our gain. After you have tortured him to death. Macaronious, curius, come. How does your emperor look from that position? - Is this the way you repay those who helped you build your empire? - I almost forgot you were the one who suffocated the divine tiberius with a cushion. Killing your old uncle in such a barbarous fashion was a reprehensible thing to do. Curius? - At your service ceasar. - I want you to slit this murderer's throat. And remember when you do it, it must be done slowly. I want him to suffer. -Hmm - I don't wish you to suffer lepidus, drink this. - You think I'm a fool? I knew that the messenger was eluding to you. - Alluding to me? Could you think anything like that? What reason would I possibly have? Perhaps drusilla has a reason. She wants her new husband to be emperor. She is more than a little ambitious, but why me? I'm already first lady of the empire. - Because you want the empire for your son, - a child who still sucks from a slaves nipples, leave little nero out of it. You see conspirators hiding in every corner of the palace and have anybody you suspect put to death on some feeble excuse. - The more you kill, the fewer enemies you have. - With lepidus and macronious out of the way, who is there left to fear? - No one at all. But I should have drusilla killed and you. However, I will send you into exile in caprine for the time being. You must understand if only for appearances sake, I have to send you away, I have to. - I'm grateful for your leniency, it's most generous. Try to be the same with the populace. They love you and respect you. - No, don't ask me that. As long as there are enemies of Caesar hidden everywhere. I want them. If it means putting the city to the torch, every inch of it. - But why? He's so inhuman. - He is Caesar, it's all predestined. You can't change it. So stop worrying about it. You are soon to follow the will of the gods and fulfill the prophecy. Once his sisters are on caprine in exile, your way will be free to become empress. - How can I come to caligula's notice? - Leave the arrangements to me dear, trust in your mother. I know one way. He'll want everyone in Rome to forgive him for this massacre. So he'll give them a spectacle. It's the patrician way to placate the fury of the mob. And you will be the first woman to fight a gladiator and win. Why else do you suppose I taught you how to do battle? And when you were only a baby I gave you your first lessons in love making. - By order of Caesar, glorious ruler of the Roman empire and the population - after the punitive measures taken for the plot against his divine person. - There is going to be a free distribution of grain at the end of the combat in the circus. - Come on - Oh they adore me, just for my amusement, they'll sacrifice their lives. - Will be thumbs down this time, what do you say? -10 - make it 20. -All right. - I hate violence. Unless those who perform it, are put to death instantly. - Enjoying yourself little sister? - More than I can say, I love the way you use your thumb. - I'm afraid your boyfriend does not enjoy it. Each gladiator to die takes with him a handful of sestertius which he has bet on him. - You speak the truth, Caesar. It pains the pocket as well as the heart, - try to think of a new game, I get tired. All this blood is so boring. I want to be excited. Leave it to me divine one. I prepared a surprise for you. - Ave Caesar, mighty emperor I salute you. - Why send such a splendid creature to die in the arena? - I did my best to dissuade her from entering the contest. Only she's a determined girl and I couldn't. She wanted to put her life in your hands. Her destiny depends on her emperor's thumb up or down. - I Grant you two acres of land and 400 gold pieces. - My thanks Caesar. - I granted you double 'cause you're a woman. But I want something in exchange. I want you to be emasculate him. Do not disobey me. You are ordered by your divine emperor. - You have no choice messalina, obey him or you will be killed as well as me. - You didn't obey me. Made a fool of me in front of the crowd. I want to know why you did it. Your pride could get you into trouble. - I see no reason to turn a gladiator into a eunuch. You have courage and your reply is sharp, but is that the real reason you assert your will? With due respect Caesar, I am strong because I'm still a virgin and will remain so until I decide to change my condition. Are you telling me that if I order you to bed with me, you'll deny me my desire in that too? - Yes and I'll ask the judgment of Aphrodite. - Do not call upon the goddess of love to intervene. She could not be fair to one whom she could only envy. - My dedication to vesta is second only to my loyalty to my divine emperor, it is for him to decide my fate. - Please let me go now. - It is I, who is your slave messalina, do with me as you wish. Caress me with your warm lips. - Do not fear him my lady. He was made a eunuch before Caesar permitted him to attend you at the baths. - He could have been spared. I did not need assistance. I swim very well. The temperature's to my liking. Would you say there's enough milk in it? - She never gives enough milk unless she's excited by her lover. Bring in phallonious - I would appreciate a swimming lesson. Didn't you hear? I gave you an order! - Yes mistress. - Aren't you going to remove that? - Oh no, I cannot. - I would have thought a eunuch had nothing there to hide. The gods were indeed kind to you. It's big as a fir tree. It must be as been as told as long ago that if you prune a tree it's branches grows stronger. Come in. - Whoa, whoa, whoa Ave Caesar. - Every mare in the stable lives only to be mounted by that stallion. - Oh curius he is undoubtedly the greatest stallion in the empire my lncitatus, organize a gala evening to honor my remarkable horse. Now go. I will make you a gift my dear. As soon as it is born, you shall have the son of lncitatus. Today at the request of Caesar to confer the honorary right of the stallion lncitatus to sit here among us. As a basis for this demand he would remind us, how when Alexander was in macedon, he deified his horse bacephalus. - The points Caesar makes is just. But I would ask you fathers of the senate to imagine what the divine Augustus would have said. - Well, did you hear that? Oh, noble lncitatus. The wise words of your fellow senators. Listen. - Your pretension's divine Caesar are an insult to the senate and to the people overall. - I envy your tongues, that they can twist such thoughts into words. Have you forgotten who named this noble creature and covered him with glory? Surely you can't have forgotten. It was the romans. If your opinion is that his breathing doesn't quite reach the standard of your own well he has a pedigree to prove it. It's an insult to the senate an affront to Rome. I never heard of anything so ridiculous. - Do I have to remind you as well? That if it were not for my wise and just form of ruling. You would not be here at all. - In that case I prefer to retiring into voluntary exile. - I will follow you - I agree with you Absolutely agree. - As you would have it, exile can be very lonely, a horrid experience, especially when you are out of favor with your emperor. And there's no need to go. You can remain in the senate and be at Liberty to say anything you like there. I only want you to admit this horse is your equal. - Our return will disturb the peace and tranquility of caligula. - That's the understatement of the year 50. I'm going to keep well out of his way for the moment. He'll go mad when he finds we've left the island. - It seems his craze he already found. Messalina. I think I can deal with her. She's a cheap little trollop. - Permit me, divine Caesar, to present my friend piso and his young bride. - A couple of such celebrated virtue and they do great honor to Rome and her empire. - My life and my property are yours to command divine Caesar. - Of that we are certain. Go now and join my guests. - Thank you. - Come - follow me. - A particularly revolting couple. - I would bet a gold earring they're both virgins - you think? - One look tells you. - Curius - What may I do for you Caesar? - Contrive a way of getting our newlyweds to consummate their love in the imperial bedchamber. - It shall be done. - The marriage will now be consummated. According to ancient custom as laid down by romulus and the venerable Caesar octavian Augustus. Leave us now. - Take our hands off the bride. She's mine. Turn over, the consecration ceremony is not complete without the husband. - Drink. It will give you strength, make you love living and live for loving. There's crushed lotus blossom in it a potion prepared, especially by my mother. - Your mother knows more than bacchus crushing lotus blossom, indeed. It's a drink fitting only for an emperor. - Your health means much to her, - despite which I do not feel at all well today. - Does the return of your sisters upset you? - Ah, I'm cursed with sisters, since they came out of exile, they've avoided me as hard as they can. I know they're waiting for me to call on them. Only I do not intend to forgive them. - Look - I love you callisto I'm consumed with desire for you. - More than for your brother? - Oh, caligula holds no fascination for me now. And has no objection to my loving you. He promised to let me do what I want. If you'll divorce your wife for me. - Divorce is no problem. My wife shares the bed of caligula, - No one thought it could be done. When he reached that craggy range, he took all the elephants up those passes. But what do you know merope of all these ancient things? It's a history lesson, nothing more. - Your exploits interest me far more than those of the legendary Hannibal. He's long dead, and buried.. While we have much life left before us. - Oh yes, we should truly enjoy it. Live for today. Tomorrow is too late. - I've called you to a meeting here so as to avoid suspicion, if news of this plot leaks out, all of us here will fall victim to the source of the praetorian guard. Luckily even curius has realized at last that caligula must be removed from power for the good of the empire. - Well at least that's positive, but don't have many illusions. It's going to be dangerous. It's my duty to warn all of you that if any of my brothers' legions remain faithful to him, the outcome is in doubt. - I know, it's a difficult task, but a great deal of preparation has gone into it. Under pressure I feel the key man should fall under our command -and curius? - He's a problem we'll have to deal with. He will have outlived his purpose. - We need someone to lead the revolt, nominal head, a man who has public approval - still claudius has to agree if he must rule. - You'll find he will if he believes he's destined to. Be careful about it though, claudius must not realize who is in this. It could mean the end. I'm sure he'd find a plot unpardonable. - Caligula must be warned at once. - No. His destiny is ordained, you cannot link it with yours. - There's no other solution except to flee. - Leave it to me. I've always foreseen what is right to do. My advice has always served you well. - You here, to what do I owe this honor? - I had trouble sleeping. I saw it was illuminated in here. So I wandered right in. I'd probably find no one else awake at this hour, except you sage claudius. - I study history all night. You call that sage, then sage is claudius. - You should be a part of history, it's only right. Not simply sitting there studying it. - I leave that to my glorious nephew. Your youth prevents you appreciating the past. - Humility is not one of the best requisites of greatness. You should not underestimate yourself. - Your kindness is ovennhelming. I don't know why I should merit such appraisal from you. Tell me the real reason that you are here. - I'm bored with life here in the palace. I need some new distractions, a new experience. I'm tired of doing what a woman is supposed to do. - It's not easy for a woman like you to satisfy your ambitions in the world we live in now. She must conform. But with me, you've no need to play that role. My impotence prevents me from treating you as others do. - Don't resign yourself to so sad of fate, I'll soon restore your former vigor and make you feel a man once more. If you desire me, I'll be yours and yours alone. I'll be true to you always. Death to caligula! Death to caligula! - Where is curius, my faithful preacher to the god and messalina? Calisto? Aginus? Where are my sisters now? They've all betrayed me. Avenge myself upon them. I swear before all mighty jove, I am emperor and my origins are divine. - You have always been my friend and I know what you are here for. Curius you, you are my witness. You must be sure that those who follow us know, that I died with dignity and with poise. - Long live claudius. Long live the emperor! - Do you think I'm beautiful fortescue? - More beautiful than Helen of Troy, a whore worthy of the gods. - You wicked little thing. - But my lady did not jove choose a whore for his Venus. - I want to be a vessel virgin for claudius. - Don't be too hard on one who already has difficulty getting it up. - You're just envious of him because at least his doesn't drag on the floor. - As an emperor I envy him, but certainly not as a man, feast your eyes on this. - None of us knew or even suspected what claudius intended to do. Thanks to Amelia she caught us red handed. - What you tell him is bad. - You'll have to believe me. I'm telling the truth. Never doubt my sincerity, affection and loyalty agrippina. I even managed to convince the emperor claudius to let you keep the rooms you occupied during the reign of caligula. - And what was his reaction? - So far no objection. On the contrary, she appeared to go along with the decision about you. - Surprisingly generous offer. Her generosity I hope spreads to my uncle claudius. Wonderful. You can rise the ardor of the emperor. I give you all the strength I had in my youth. This is the greatest gift you could give your emperor. - So said the great Titus livius of his fair land. And I agree with him. Ave, claudius agusta. Ave. May Mars be with you. - And with you too, good and valorous thespasian. You bring news? - Good news, claudius. King caratacus is under siege in the aulus plautius and will soon have to surrender for lack of food and water. The rest of his tribe is in flight, the cavalry in hot pursuit. - Thanks must be made to the gods. Soon we shall return to Rome in triumphant glory to enjoy once more, the comfort of our homes and families. - How dare you come in here without my permission. - You told me I could enter whenever I wanted to. - Only if you have something important for me, if I remember correctly - and I do. - Go. Well, what is it? - Is not I who have it. - I do not like riddles, speak clear. - I was speaking of this. - Oh. It looks the same as before. Why say you do not have it? - It's not like that of the other, his is surely double the size. - No I don't believe it. - It's true. Absolutely true. A satyr beside him is a child. - Where did you find him? - He's a regular client of the house of pleasure. - Very interesting. - I already arranged everything. - Good morning to all my precaus. - I appreciate the thought. You came into my mind just now when I realized today's the day of Venus. I just had a feeling you'd get turn up today arcadian. - I'll bet you say that to all the lads. We know each other well enough to tell the truth. - It's impossible to hide anything from you. You see right into my heart. - Oh you're not serious, no, a girl from anatolia? - Out of this world - but is her body any good? - You'll be delirious - but will she do everything? - Anything you want. She likes to please the customers. Have a look. - I do what you like. - I never saw anybody as pretty as you. - Don't let it put you off. I'm not made of glass. - But you're as delicate as a Rose. - Roses are grown for only one reason, they have to be plucked. Oh, when does the pruning begin? You've got such a wild reputation that everybody's talking. It's time that you gave me a chance. Fantastic. Oh, I can wait no longer. Quickly, I'm anxious to hoist your mast and sail to paradise. Climb aboard. Yes. - You see how I repay those who are loyal to me, callisto. - I wish I were the only one loyal to you and thus the only one to receive your favors. -All the others mean nothing. They are few and get little from me. - Loyalty and love is not easy for you. - You're wrong callisto. I'm faithful to you. You're the only one I give myself freely to. The others are merely diplomatic relations. - I nominate you secretary of sex. - It's about the only real way of attaining anything. If you think about it, you can't fail to notice that I don't go with anybody like messalina. The ones I choose can help me. I'm ambitious but the empress just goes with anyone. - She's really shrewd. When she feels like having an adventure, she goes outside. Not within the palace. We can talk about her as much as we like. But no one ever caught her. - I wish I were like her. - One of these days she'll make a fatal error and that'll be her downfall. - And we must be ready for it. That poor old fool. My uncle, the emperor, would die if he knew his wife betrayed him with the lowest of slaves. - Agrippina - but let's talk no more of them now. - It's all clear. Come on seven. Two I win. Yeah roll them again. Hey, look at that. Come on. Hey, look at the whore with the dwarf. Let's have some fun with them. Oh! Let me go! - Let me down! What do you want from me? Ow, oh stop let go. Leave her alone! Did you hear me? I've had enough! - Oh thank you sir, thank you. -Are you all right my lady? - Pray to whom do we owe our lives? - Veroni, I'm an instructor at the school of gladiators. Oh my empress. - You deserve a reward, and you shall have it. - You go ahead to the palace and tell my slaves to prepare a bath of perfumes and oils. Hurry. This young man will escort me. - Yes divine one. - No, veroni wait. You shall have your reward here where you saved my life. - Gaius silio wishes to have audience with you. - Well, I will see him. - I bring your news of the divine emperor, your highness. - So claudius is on his way home. - He is leaving the island of britain in a few days. He wanted me to proceed him with the good news. - The empress, does she know yet? - No, she is not in the palace. - I will see that she receives this news. She may find it too much for her. You see, she just gave birth. - Birth to an heir? - A boy, handsome. - But - I know what you're thinking. The emperor's been away for a year, so he cannot be the father, but the emperor is divine and what's impossible for us. Is possible for gods. Immortals can make their thoughts, perform deeds for them. On second thought, you can tell messalina, but allow me to prepare her as I think fit. Don't forget in her condition, she wouldn't like a surprise. - This is getting late. My absence will already have been noticed at the palace. - Will we see each other again? - Never, you must forget this encounter forever. Do you hear? - Never in a million years. - You're sounding like a bore. - You look well, messalina, let me look at you. Motherhood has made you stronger and more beautiful than you ever were. - Yes. Everything predicted by the oracle has come true for me. I have been so very fortunate. The gods indeed smile on me and give me their protection. My divine son enjoys good health too. - Claudius will be overjoyed to see. - You mean, he's soon to return? - He's on his way. - I'm not sure how to explain to him what happened. He'll never accept the child. - I think maybe there's an answer. Virgin motherhood among the gods is not uncommon. People will believe anything of deities. - I told silio claudius is only to think to have a heir. - Did you say silio? But he's the emperor's companion. - He's the one who brought news of his return. - I knew silio well, when he went to conquer gall, I was only a child. I was in love with him. I'll enjoy seeing him again. - You shall very soon and I'm sure you'll get news that is only for you. - The centurian Gaius silio requests to see you divine one. - Very well, I'll see him. Leave us. Oh silio I think I'm going to faint. - My divine empress. - I'll always be valaria to you the sweet playmate of your youth. - Do not remind me of days lost forever. Fate has decided othennise. - Is it not fate that brings you to me here today. - Fate is seldom kind and it brings me here in different circumstances. Now there is an impenetrable barrier that separates us. - You're wrong. The barrier between us will fall if you kiss me as you did when you said farewell. - Try this phallus fashioned by nature my lady it will give you vigor. You too centrulus. It will, it will remind you ofarcadian's. - You impotent little runt, you know arcadian too eh? - Oh I did before he was food for worms, our divine messalina sucked him drier than desecated coconut. - I'll thank you to keep quiet. - I mean no ill offense. I merely told drusilla of what a lovely couple of doves her aunt and silio are. - Thanks, but be careful in public silio it could cause talk. - I think those present are well occupied. - Yet there are those here who spy on us. - Agrippina - She can't wait to catch me out and she'll be the first to inform the emperor. She still has a lot of influence. - Then let us find a quieter place. - Not now my dear. My absence would soon arouse suspicion. Long live the emperor Long live the emperor! Long live the emperor! Long live the emperor! Long live the emperor! - Down with the sails! Rest your oars. Long live the emperor! Long live the emperor! - Ave divine Caesar. Rome is waiting to honor your triumph. - There's no need for us to hurry back to Rome, saranous. I think it wiser to wait here in austia to, to be ready. That we give our senators time to prepare for our arrival. Long live the emperor! Long live the emperor! Long live the emperor! - Take this to the senate. - Oh divine claudius. - Oh my dearest niece. As impatient and impulsive as you ever were. I gave orders that the women were to await my return at the palace. - But I had to see you at once and alone. - What is it that's so urgent? - I'm not sure how to start. I wanted to be the first to tell you, as you're nearest relative, I felt it my duty to come here and inform you about certain things that have occurred. - Is there anything wrong between you and my divine wife, messalina? - No, I do not enter into this. It's between you and your wife, and there is much wrong. - She has given me a male heir. It's good enough. - That you accept it is not the question. I thought you should know that every man in Rome calls the empress his concubine. - I forbid you to talk like that. - Forbid it. But they all talk like that. If you like, you can turn a blind eye. You need do nothing until you have proof of her behavior. I just wanted to put you on your guard. I thought you should know. I'm only a woman like her and women tend to be jealous. But jealousy you will find can be caused by memories. Small girl who loved you once. And always hoped that you would find happiness. It upsets her to see you betrayed. - A budget for the year is carefully outlined here. So you can inspect it and have time to make your comments on it. I trust you approve. With you looking after it, I hardly to have need to see it. Our coffers have never been so full, despite the expense of the new port at austia. You've always handled it with amazing ability. And for this reason, the acceptance of your resignation is out of the question. How can I persuade you to remain in the post of governor general? - It is my duty to thank you, but - I think I deserve an explanation that goes a little further than that. Do not fear to give me your reasons, speak. - Very well. The reason I handed in my resignation is the behavior of the empress, divine Caesar. - Go on don't hesitate. I'm prepared to listen to whatever it is that you have to tell me no matter how painful it may be for me to hear. - Her conduct is altogether unworthy of her position. I was hoping to spare you the details. There's unrest among the population. Even the patricians are starting to talk, the senate too. And they say she is planning to put Gaius silio on the throne in your place. - It's not important to protect anything other than the empire. Remember what comes first is the state. I must ignore my pride, so forget yours. You are right divine Caesar. I will stay. - For the security of the state. I will carry out the duty that I am forced to humiliated beyond words, I swear messalina shall be tried. And if found guilty, I shall condemn her. She dies but, you have orders to spare britannicus. I want no harm to befall her son. The child is innocent. Leave us now. Stop where you are! - You still need to submerge yourself in memories divine one? - The past is what I live for. Oh, agrippina what else is there? - I don't value the past. Today is more valuable. More than the old world. You must live for today. Prepare for the future. I know you learn and you have a duty to the populace, but first learn to live a little, -and learn to be more human? Perhaps. - You think I'd rule better? - One day the historians will write books about you. And I hope they be fair, but I want those who follow us to read about you and know you were a great emperor. - Why are you so nervous my darling? There's nothing to fear. - I fear not for myself. I live only to love you messalina. Though I live, I will be dead if you were not with me. So I fear not death. - No one will disturb us now. The emperor is too occupied with the fears of his own. He won't come to me until tonight. Kiss me my love. Time is running out and I need the warmth of your love. - I, tiberius claudius nero rusus romanicus emperor of Rome by the will of the gods, and by the people elected make for my legitimate wife Claudia Julia agrippina who from this moment on will obtain the title empress of Rome.
