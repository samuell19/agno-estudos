An announcement letter? From Lu... Lupin III? Yes... Don't worry. There are enough bodyguards of mine. We do not have need of the police. They wouldn't have had to be informed... I don't know who has summoned them, but... a Japanese inspector just showed up. Well, Lupin... When will you show up? What do you want to investigate? Ha ha ha, don't worry... I've not come to investigate on this palace. I've come to put you in guard... because this type of man keeps what he promises. The Organizer today is also the master of this palace. It will be time soon. Here. Attention, all... during the fireworks we uncork this. What, that one! It's a vintage so rare, voices say that it hardly exists. Eventually... Lupin won't make it. Because we'll be the ones to drink LUPIN. May I ask you to applaud the Owner and its pride: His three daughters. My, My precious... wine... disappeared. Lupin III!? I have taken your "jewel"... Turn the lights on. Don't turn the lights on! It's going well here. How are you doing? It is going like planned, Lupin. About those crystals of the sky that you are collecting... I found out something interesting. That's good news, but tell me later. It... seems to me that someone just arrived. Bye. Hi, do a trick. C'mon, c'mon. A magic trick! You are fortunate, guys. Today, you can see it for free. I smell... not the smell of a clown... but the smell of a thief. Co, co, co. Give me back the crystal. Co, coco? The crystal of the sky, that you have stolen. The crystal, Lupin. Even if you have them all, you can't do anything with them. Give it to me! Even if you have them all, you can't do anything with them. Don't you intend to return it? Don't you intend to return it? The smell is different. That's not the smell of the Zenigata I know. Where is that woman? Which woman? The she-cat (the woman thief) The woman, Fujiko Mine, where is she? Fujiko Mine, where is she? I could also avenge... me here, Lupin. I could also avenge... me... here? Feel my anguish! What? The Inspector stayed... at the palace!? Sure. Lupin is a man that always achieves his goal. That crystal of the sky is an imitation. Why didn't you inform me? One Zenigata chased Lupin, then... this means that there were two Zenigatas. What? Someone broke off the key to the wine cellar!? Lo, Lomane, earls... T... t... the year of the Lomane earls... He disappeared? Avenge himself? People that want to avenge for you, are very numerous. Hmm... But, those eyes... Somewhere... I already saw them. Even if he disguised as Zenigata, he could not hide his eyes, true? Yes. He also aims at the crystals. Your collection? Yes, and he told me, they'll serve me nothing, even if I own them all. Therefore, maybe, he also has some. According to your information, the crystals of the sky are 7 in all, and I have 3. It's possible that he has those missing 4. Listen, Jigen. The one that disguised as Zenigata... It is possible that he already... preceded us on the next destination. Eh! Goemon's competition? Half point - Mr. Goemon! Those crystals... were coming from eastern Greece. Only one remained here in Greece. You have investigated well, Jigen. Ah, Eastern Greece. I know that we'll have to go very far. Yes, towards Asia, to the mythical earth. Mr. Goemon! Bravo Goemon. These proud Europeans have lost their faces. Sit down... in my simple house. Listen, Jigen. It'd be better if you rest, if you have a cold. From when we arrived here, I can't stop her any more. Hmm. Let me see. Don't worry, that gentleman is a doctor. It seems to me that he has an allergy, but I don't know the cause. I feel strange. Don't you hear? No... I seem to feel too much. Some noise I have never heard before. It enters my ears and makes me feel strange. Well, how do you feel now? It works. Wonderful! Old Gentleman, what's the trick? That's not a trick, it's a suitable care. Since a long time ago, one also used music to cure in this country. Therapy music... is not an unusual thing. Anciently, Pythagoras also cured illnesses with music. Pythagoras... Is this the effect of the harp? No, it's not the tool, but the sounds. One chooses the sounds on the basis of the illness to cure. Ah, the sounds... Hmm, Pythagoras. It's the treasure that was handed down by our ancestors. Ha! A treasure... Old gentleman, does a score exist? For instance carved into a stone. Because a treasure of one's ancestors should not get lost. Should I always listen to this music? Sometimes it cures right away, sometimes it takes more time. Lupin... Help me! Fujiko! Welcome. Ah ah, here's an annoyance. This isn't a place for women. Thanks, Lupin. You are kind. Always. Will you help me? Always. I am being chased. Like always. This time the man is dangerous. For this I repeat you should've only one man, the undersigned. I met him accidentally. Just like you, Lupin, he is a collector. The crystals of the sky! Recently I heard that one was stolen... from the palace of a multimillionaire, in the Azure Coast. Where's that one from? From a museum. The owner of this crystal has donated... it, because it gives bad luck. I threw an eye onto it on the single day of... the year in which it's shown to the public. Therefore, you preceded me. Hmm. It goes well for me, but I have only one. Is it OK, even if it gives bad luck? You, and bad luck? No! Because I could still date you. In the end he gives bad luck after all. What? While it isn't possible, however we met again. Who do you talk about? A man you also know. Me too? Yes, a man which they all call the "Magician". Pycal... still alive? He is also interested in the crystals of the sky. Understood... Give me the crystal you stole. I was surprised to meet him again. Did you steal that crystal right before his eyes, Fujiko? Yes, it seems that he was mortified. Sure, sure. The magician lost his face. That's not a funny thing. He is obstinate. Though I escaped, he'll keep on looking for me. Lupin protect me. I am tired. If he continues like this, he will kill me. I could protect you, but... That's all right - tell me your conditions. Give me this crystal. It has nothing to do with that. It's more important than life. And... there would be another thing... Two, no! Ha!! This is wonderful! That's the same sound as the harp of mine! This sound serves to cure a person that has a lot of vitality. Orpheus's sound! But why from this sword? I do not know anything, so asking me is useless. Ha! It stopped! What a waste. Hello Pycal, it seems to me that you're in excellent health. It's impossible that a man can feel it... Do we have the same hobby? Have you made out with the woman? Don't take it personally, but she chose me. Give me the crystal of the sky. And for this time I leave you be. So you want to become unlucky, too. You don't know the true value of that crystal. Like giving pearls to the pigs. I don't think so. What do you want to do with the... collection of the crystals of the sky? That's none of your business. I thought you were burnt? What a beautiful skin. You! Do you like the night? It was night the last time we met. The next time we meet in the afternoon... and then I'll invite you to lunch. What? It is truly on that island? Yes, it is. Didn't you kill him in the valley bottom... to find out where his hiding-place is? He always appears in the evening. I thought maybe he would've gone back... to his hiding-place before morning. Like a vampire? A vampire would be no nicer. Ah Ah, where does this vampire sleep or rest? It seems to me that he refuses to come to lunch with me. Listen, Jigen. So this is the secret of his beautiful skin. That's the reason why he prefers dinner over lunch? This also is a part of his plans... Finished. What? But we have not taken the treasure yet. We'll get back to that later, for now let's get out of here. You finally woke up? I finished a task. So did I. I took the woman's crystal. What!? While you're following the tracking... device, I also took the last crystal. You noticed the tracking device? He, I put it onto the bird and made him return to the island. To arrange the things here. What did you do with the woman? I will calmly take your crystal, after avenging me abundantly. My freezing gas!? What do we do now!? We get back in first class. Luckily there was another place available. They chose their tomb. That was the reason for the free place. He arrived shortly after sunset, and laid waste to everything without even touching anything. Truly a magician... The crystal of the sky is a treasure... of the ancestors of this area. I didn't want to leave it to him, but... there was not nothing to do. He burnt three buildings with the fire he provoked. Goemon, you weren't able to slice Pycal? I sliced him, but it didn't have any... effect on him, he was like a ghost. He's really a magician... and Fujiko? She disappeared with him. Is it possible that she betrayed us? Goemon, you lack experience. The treason, for the women, is one of their accessories. I've the crystal of the Sun, Mars and Jupiter. I have three. And the others, Pycal, has the crystal of... the Moon, Mercury and Saturn in his hands. And also another one. That of Fujiko. This here is the figure of the Venus's crystal. Are there figures in every crystal? Yes, the true value of these crystals, lies in the engraved figures... Right, old Gentleman? Hmm, I wouldn't know. You said treasures belong to the ancestors. In this area, there used to be seven crystals, right? Right. All of the seven crystals were kept in the temple of this area. But fifty years ago, an archaeologist took them away, saying it was for a piece of research. He rushed away with them. However there remained one. I re-bought it from a receiver of stolen goods, that... exploited the situation well, by raising the price. But you have three. I am always able to obtain what I aim at. When I saw the 1st in a shop of antique... trade, I decided to collect all of them. Collect! You might be able to collect them all, but you'll... not be able to gather the meaning of the figures. Could be. I must improve the resistance to the ultraviolet rays. Splendid! It is just like the singing of the sirens that enchanted the sailors! Still alive, Lupin! We will decide who will be the owner... of the seven crystals of the sky. I'll wait for you tomorrow midnight at the restored amphitheater. At the amphitheater? Then, maybe, Lupin... understood the meaning of the figures! Useless... He will not be able to activate them. He could be able to. Know well, that you mustn't underestimate Lupin! I will win. I do not lose against anybody. If you have the figures, you don't need the crystals anymore, right? Give them to me. Tomorrow at midnight I will give you all seven. Good! Hold it, Lupin! I don't care if thousands of people... will vanish, if I'm able to break you. I'll win against you! And with this sound I will dominate the world! What? What's wrong? Pycal, do you know what one had done to stop the singing of the sirens... that were enchanting the sailors and stealing their life? Orpheus's harp! Good magician, you also know the legends well! However, you did not know that also today... someone exists who succeeded to play it. You were able to solve the mystery of the figures in the crystals!? I would not know, however at least I understood that this... one is not a figure, but a number. In the antiquity musical notes were suitable so. You are successful there, good. Pythagoras, the big mathematician, was also a musician. These figures show together with the... numbers, the way of pinching the cords. Yes. The therapy music can also be used to destroy. However... you won't be able to sound it. That's OK, I already have a good "executor". Enjoy my "execution". This One is called: The goddess of the revenge. Lupin...! Does Pycal run? The match already finished. What're you doing, Jigen!? Jigen's serious, I cannot stop him. Don't ask me to spare your life. Neither do you. Try it with this! Lupin! Maybe that was too late. Lupiiiin! I can't make less than to kill him, even if is insignificant. You were cautious enough to not leave him alive. This time, you want to revenge Lupin? I only take what I want. The crystals... Be tame. Then you might get down! You'll be the one going down with the crystals. I forgot the custom. I can shoot you just as you did with Lupin. You would regret... No, not at all. I have the true ones here. These are enough! I'll dominate the world! It's already morning! You must thank me, because I sent you to a place, where you'll no longer have to dread the sun. This is really the crystal of the luck. It's exactly like you. However, a thief is a thief. It's a such waste for such antiques like the... celestial crystals to be in your collection. I won't let the thief do what he wants. I'll not hand over the wisdom of human kind... to a handful of wealthy villains and thieves. We'll meet again. Things don't break so easily... isn't it fate. Orpheus went down to the underworld for his deceased wife. He was allowed to bring his wife, Eurydice. Under the condition that he wouldn't... look back until he returned to Earth. But Orpheus couldn't keep his promise. He couldn't help but look back. His wife cried and disappeared. Since he couldn't keep his promise, the two were forever separated. Orpheus harp, which impressed the king of underworld... Pycal, that music can be played to you forever. If you died, then you would be Eurydice. Eurydice, who waited for Orpheus's music and was betrayed. That man worked hard. It was right to have that man work in order... to collect the celestial crystals... to open that competition for him. Now, how should I steal the three... crystals from that man, Lupin the Third? Old man, I'm indebted to you. I'll tolerate the three crystals as the prize. Excuse me. Don't worry. The music pieces are yours. Please treasure them.
