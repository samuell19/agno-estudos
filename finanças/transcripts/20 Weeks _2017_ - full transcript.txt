Welcome to your 20-week ultrasound. Just taking a few measurements before the doctor comes in. Ah, okay. - Ooh. Maya, look. Look, look, look, look. - I know, he's amazing. - I can see his little penis. Is that what that is? - Yes. You're right. - All right, here you go. Take a sip of your juice. - No, no! - This is your juice. You ordered it. - No! Derek, take it. No. It tastes like lemonade, remember? - Eileen. Here, just take it, please. - Eileen, hi. - Ronan, hey. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, hi, hi. Hi. How are you? How is it goin'? Derek, you remember Ronan, right? - Hey, little man. You remember me? No. I'm sorry. Eileen, this is Maya, my girlfriend. - Hey. Hi. - Maya, this is Eileen. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - And this is little man, D-Dog. I can't believe you don't remember me, Derek. You remember fist, pound, jellyfish? Oh, yeah. Oh, it's a tickle jellyfish. What? Oh, there's another one. What? Uh, uh! Tickle, tickle. Wha! Roar, roar, roar! - It's been way too long, man. - Yeah. You still playing at Docs Clock on Thursdays? - No, I'm teaching poetry two nights a week instead. - Oh wow, nice. Actually, Maya is also a writer. - Cool. Yeah, figured I'd put my MFA to good use. Maybe some day make an exit from Trader Joe's. - Hey, we had some pretty good times at Trader Joe's, right D? I remember. - That's true. Well, ah, listen, don't be a stranger just Seth's out of the picture, you know? - Right. You still have my number, right? - Yeah, we'll call you next time we go to the park. - Do that, please. I love hanging with little man. Double jellyfish. Oh, crisscross! Ah! All right, you guys. - Bye. Bye, bye, Derek. Nice meeting you. Yeah, nice meeting you. - You used to work at Trader Joe's? - No. Ah, Steph and I used to hang out with Derek a lot. That's cool. - The kid's awesome, right? - Yeah. - You don't think he's awesome? - I didn't say that, I said yeah. - What is it? - Derek is adorable. I just, I think Eileen's really young to have a kid. - Yeah, but she and Marcus were like, this is awesome. - Really? - Yeah! - And they're still together? - Things got a little tough when Marcus went on tour. - Ah, see. So she didn't have a choice. I look at that and I'm just like, whoa. - Are you saying you don't want kids now? - No, I just think having kids is hard. - Well, yeah, and amazing. I mean, did you see Derek? - Yeah, I mean, it's fine to get all misty-eyed. But I'm a pragmatist, you know? Do I still want to be working 60 hours a week at some stupid pop culture website and have a baby? Will I still have time to be creative if there's a bunch of screaming kids running around? - Who said anything about a bunch? I said one. You wouldn't want one? - I mean, maybe. I, you know, if the timing was right and I could still be as productive as I am now. - Who says you can't be productive and have a kid? Maya, you are amazing. You are always writing. That is never gonna stop or change or ever go away. - You know, that's easy for you to say because you're a man. Like, you're body's not gonna change, but what if I get so big I can't, I don't know, work. Or like the hormones change my brain so I can't think straight or my vagina gets so big I can't enjoy sex anymore. - Is that a real thing? What? - What if your vagina gets so big I can't enjoy sex anymore? - Ronan. I'm serious. This is real stuff women have to actually deal with. - We are in our 30's. We are not getting any younger. We have been dating for 11 months now. We are either on the path or not. Not wanting kids is a deal breaker. You know that. - Okay, just take it easy. You're being so black and white about things. Okay, my mantra is never say never, but you know, all we have is the information we have which is I really like being with you. - What if I get hit by this bus? - Stop, don't do that. But... - It's not funny. But we... - It's not funny. I'm joking. - I love you. - I love you. Come on, let's get you to work. Those are his legs. - So tiny. - And his feet. - Wow. Really? - You said my music stuff could be prominently displayed in our place. - I know, I did. - You love Ray Jon. It was, that was our first conversation. - I mean, yeah, I like Ray Jon. - Like, like not here? - I just think we should have something more artsy over the couch. - Where's Ray Jon gonna go? - Um. I don't know, maybe he can go like over there? Or um, or why doesn't he go with the rest of your music and art stuff? - But that's in the spare room. - Yeah. I think this is the perfect place for it. Okay, maybe Ray Jon in the middle but we put some artsy pieces around it. - Oh, now we're talkin'. Yeah. - Art of compromise. - No, the art of love. Come here. Come here. Ray Jon. You okay? Mmm-hmm. - I'm just gonna take some stills here. - Is everything okay? - I actually need to go check on something. Can you give me a second? - Sure, yeah. Everything okay? - I'm sure everything's fine. Jack. - No. - It was Three's Company. No, this is horrible. - Thank you. All right, I'll be right back. Yeah, yeah. - Alternate nights, like does she have girl's night and you get to have... Yeah, I'm workin' on that. Right now it's just sort of a theory, but it's, yeah. - Maya, you good in there? - Uh. Yeah. I told you I was gonna puke. - That's so not you. Are you okay? - Yeah, I just haven't been feeling good all week. - Oh, man. What? What do you mean what? - What? I just haven't been feeling well all week. Did you take the pregnancy test yet? - God, Ruby, no. I'm not pregnant. - How do you know? - I just know. - Are you sure? - I mean, no one can ever be a 100 % sure, but no, I mean... Well, that's why there's the pill. - Yeah, but you know I can't take the pill. It makes me so moody and... - I know, I know. - Oh God, Ruby, why did you bring this up? I feel so stressed. - Oh, don't be stressed. We're at a party, you're having a party. All your friends are out there. We'll go eat chips and cake and... Oh God. - It'll be so much fun. No, Rubs, I can't right now. I need to go do something. Oh come on, Maya. - I'm like never gonna see you again, dude. You know it, right? - That's not true. I see you know. - Yeah, now with the housewarming party and then like... Maya. Hey, I'll be right back. What, where are you going? See you around. - Maya. Maya, what's happening? - I just need, I need to go, I need to just go take care of something. - But this is our party. - Yeah, I know. You should enjoy it, and seriously. - You sure everything's okay? - Yeah, bye. - Hey. Maya? Maya. Maya. What's going on? What's happening? Talk to me. Are you sure? Okay. Are you sure this is... Whoa. Ah. Ah, yeah, could you, ah, give us a second? Thanks. This is okay. We're okay. Uh. I'll be right back. - It's taking forever. - Why do you think it's taking so long? - Seriously. You okay? - Mmm-hmm. Oh. - What, what, what? What? - I think it's just his little, his little feet. - Are you kickin' mama bear? Are you kickin' mama bear? Maybe we got a little soccer player. - Yeah. Ruby. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. You're the one who was in a rush to hike. - I just need to like move, get around. - No, I get it. You can't drink, anyway. - I was getting nothing done on the new script. - Nothing? We can take it super slow. - Nope, nope. - But if you feel like crap. - I'm fine. I mean, I'm not sick. Okay. - I totally puked three times at the library anyway. - Oh no. - Yeah. Same thing at last week's pitch. - Ugh, really? - Yeah, it was like a bunch of young guys. I totally ran out in the middle. - Did they know you were pregnant? - No, I just told 'em I ate a bad salad. A bad salad? - Yeah. - Wow. Maybe they'll call you back in again. - No. No, I don't think so. Look. It's so foggy. Yeah, but it's beautiful. - Yeah, it is. I just so didn't expect it. - But it's good. - Yeah, I guess. - What does Ronan think? - You know, he loves babies. - That's sweet. - Yeah, sort of. - A little weird. - Yeah. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. - Maya, Ronan. - Hey, Doctor Chen. - Hi, hi, good to see you. So, ah, what is happening here? - Let me just take a look here. Here it is. Take a look here. Can you rotate? I wanna just try a different angle. Maya? - Hi. This way. - Hey, it's me. No, I'm fine. I'm at Planned Parenthood. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'll just wait here. Yeah, I'm out front. Okay. - Can you tell us what's going on or... Yeah, please. - I'm just taking an extra measurement. - You okay? Hi. - Come here. Just, okay, I'm trying to understand. You're just gonna do it and not tell me? - I couldn't. I mean, I wouldn't. I know this is a decision we have to make together. - Is this what you wanna do? - Uh. I just, it just. It just feels like we're not ready to have a baby right now. - Maya, I'm scared, too. - Okay, well, you say this is my decision, but you're not making this easy. - Okay. Just imagine a year from now. Two years from now. How are you gonna feel if we end it? - But like that's just it. I have no idea how I'm gonna feel about anything in two years. I mean... Are you gonna be there when I feel like crap in this pregnancy? - Yes, Maya. - And are you gonna let me take mornings off so I can still write after the baby's born? - Yes. - And are you gonna wake up in the middle of the night for whatever reasons the baby needs? - Wake up? Yes. - And you're gonna like help him with his homework and like take him to soccer practice and all... - Yes, and yes, of course! I love soccer practice! Can you just? Okay, you know what? Okay. - What are you doing? - Maya Clawson, will you marry me? - Are you serious? You can't do this in front of Planned Parenthood. I can and I am. - That's so crazy. - Could you just answer the question, please? And just... - Ronan. What do you say? - Yes, you insane asshole, okay. Yes? - Yes. Okay? Just um, remember, I don't want a wedding or a ceremony or anything like that. - We'll do things our own way, okay? Just me and you. - Okay. - I'm sorry to have to tell you guys this, but the baby is showing symbrachydactyly on the right hand. What? - It's a term to describe a hand or foot malformation. In your baby's case, four of his digits on the right hand are missing. Here, let me, let me show you. We measure based on the bones. On the right hand, so as you can see, the upper phalanges for all of his fingers except for the thumb are missing. - How did this happen? - Was this my fault? - This has nothing to do with anything you did or didn't do. The hands form around week seven. It's very early on. Also, it seems like the baby's chest cavity is measuring to be a bit on the small side. - What? - It's just something we want to keep our eyes on. There could be potential issues with his lung development being that we want to monitor. - Why is this happening? - What did we do? I don't... - You know, the hand malformation could be isolated or it could happen due to conditions in the womb. - What do you mean by conditions in the womb? - Well, by isolated I mean that something just went wrong with the formation of his digit. For example, the hand could get stuck in the amniotic sack and it causes this kind of malformation. - Stuck? - Or another scenario could be that something went wrong with his genetic code. This is why we are a bit concerned about his chest. That in conjunction with the hand malformation could indicate a syndrome. - What? - How will you know that and then what are we supposed to do then? - Well, the next step would be to run an amniocentesis. We'll do something called a chromosomal microarray analysis to screen for possible genetic anomalies. - Genetic anomalies. - We'll do a thorough analysis for anything that might come up. Some of the more common ones like Downs and then others that are more rare, but happen in conjunction with the hand malformation. - Then what? - Then you can make an informed decision as to whether you want to move forward with the pregnancy or not. - What do you mean an informed decision? - The state of California allows termination through week 24. I know that um, I know that this is a lot to take in, so we will have you guys to see our genetics counselor and she'll go over everything in more detail. I'm gonna give you guys my number and all my personal details. Feel free to call me with any questions. Okay? I know it's a lot. Hi, the counselor's ready for you. Wanna come with me? Hello. - How you doin'? - Have a seat. Okay. These are for you. And let's go ahead and schedule your amnio. As you know, they're going to be testing for a number of chromosomal abnormalities, including Trisomy 18, Trisomy 21, Downs. It should be able to tell us quite a bit of information. So if you have any questions, you can ask me at any time. - Maya, stop. - What? - Ah, can't hear. I need to listen, okay? Sorry, it's just... - So go ahead and fill these out. Fill out the top and both sign there at the bottom. - Maya, sign here. - Thank you. Okay. - What do you think we should do? - Maya. Maya. Maya. - Hmm. What? - I think we should terminate. - What? - You asked me what I think we should do. I think we should terminate. - What time is it? - It's 6:30. I know it's early, but we have to discuss this right now. I haven't slept all night. I'm spinning out here. Get in here. - I don't want to watch our kid suffer. - I know. - So we can do this. I'll call the doctor. - Sure. Hand me that box over there. Thanks. - No. I don't want to look. Maya, no. I'm, I don't want to look at them. No, no, I don't wanna. I don't wanna. - Ronan, look. I mean, here he is. - No. - Ronan. It's our baby boy. Just look at him. He's perfect. - Have you looked it up online? There are some very serious issues associated with this. Syndromes. - Yeah, but we don't know the exact nature of it, and, come here. What if he just has a hand that's just a little bit different. - You gotta look at these pictures. Look at these kids. - No, Ronan, stop it. No. - Maya, you have to see this. - Stop it right now. - Maya! Maya, what if he, what if he can't hold a cup? What if he can't throw a ball? He can't play catch. Have you thought about any of these things, Maya? Maya, what if he can't wipe his own ass? You know what? People overcome things all the time. Yeah, well I don't want a kid that has to overcome. This is a hard thing to overcome. Look! - Stop it! Why are you acting like this? - Because, Maya, you're not listening to me. Sonograms, amnios, genetic testing. Our insurance doesn't cover any of this shit. And then what's gonna happen when he's born? What the hell the insurance is gonna cover then! - What, you think I wanna do this? No. - You think I'm like, hey, this is gonna be awesome. - Exactly. Neither of us want this. You don't want this, I don't want this. Heck, you didn't even want to have a child in the first place. - Ronan, stop it! Just shut up! Don't say that! How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee till the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach, when feeling out of sight. - From the ends of beings and ideal grace. We're gonna be okay. - I know. - We love each other. - I know. - And we're gonna love this kid. - I know, and that the timing isn't perfect. - Timing is never perfect. - I know, just as long as you're here. - I'm here. - I do love him. - I love you. - Hey, it's me. Measurements are similar to last week. How's his chest looking? - Still on the small side. We'll continue to monitor it. Are you ready? - Yeah. - You know, Maya, we don't have to do this. - Yeah, we do, Ronan. - Dr. Chen, is this gonna hurt her? - No, but maybe later you may experience some cramping. - And then what can she do? - Just rest, right? - Yes, stay off your feet. Just relax for a couple days. - Okay. - And when are we getting the results again? - Well, I have put a rush on it, so in a week. - Whoa, oh, Dr. Chen. Hold on, wait a second. Let's just all pause and hold on a second. I, I, I don't want us to be like that statistic, one in four lose the baby. - Ronan, Ronan. - Maya, I don't want us to. - Ronan, it looks worse than it is. - How can it get worse than all this? - For Maya's sake, you're welcome to step outside. - No, no. No, no, I'm okay. - Are you sure? This will just take a few moments, but I need you to stay very still. - Okay. Mmm. - Is it almost done? - Almost, she's doing really great. Just stay very still, please. - Oh, it hurts. - All right. Good job. - You okay? - Yeah, are you? - I'm okay. Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay, we did it. - Good, you did great. - Thank you. - Okay, so what's next? - We'll get you the results as fast as we can. - Thanks. - Dr. Chen, so what's it really like? Have you seen anything like this before? - Ronan, I've seen all sorts of things. - Yeah, and what do, what do people usually decide? - Ah, no two situations are alike. - No, but what do you think? - Ronan, why don't you help me up, okay? - Actually, just stay here and rest for a few more minutes. Can you monitor her, please? Ronan, why don't we talk outside, okay? - Okay. I'm out here. - Yup. How about I get you some water. Would you like some? - Oh, yeah. Thank you. For you. - Mmm. - Oh no, what? - I told you. - I thought you were hungry. - No cheese. The smell, it's like, ugh. - No problem. Hold on. Get rid of that. Here, look at that, look at that. All fixed up. We'll just, okay, we'll just get this over here. - Oh, gross. - Here you go. And ah, all right. What is it? What happened? What's happening now? - Just another rejection from a place that usually publishes my stuff. - No. Oh no, babe. I'm so sorry. This sucks. - I didn't really polish it enough. It's just every time I sit down to write, I just feel crappy or I'm tired or I can't concentrate. I knew it. Motherhood is like a slow decent in mediocrity. - Well, I read in the baby book that by week 12 it gets better. And you're there now so any day now I'm sure you're gonna feel better. - So you read a book, so now you're an expert? - I am an expert. Maya. - What, it's hot. - We are out and about. We're at a great art opening. What more could I possibly do here? - Oh, so now it's about you? - What? - It's about how you can't deal with my negativity instead of... - Whoa, whoa, it is not about me. I'm asking you what more could I possibly do to make it better. - No one's asking you to make it better because it's not going to get better. - Wow. There is no point in being sad all the time. - Stop! Do you think this was gonna be a walk in the park? I'm confused. - What can I do? - Just listen. That's it. - I am listening. - No. No, you're not. You lose it anytime I say anything. - Lose what? My temper? - Yeah, mmm-hmm. Surprise, you lose it. - I just, I, I just wanna help. - Come on. What? - Let's get out of here. Let's take a walk. - Okay, where? - I just need some fresh air. All right. - Mmm. - Maya, you okay? - Mmm-hmm, I just need a moment. Uh. - I'm gonna get the car. I'll drop you off. - No, no, no. Ronan, we're not even a block away. Just hold on. Here, just give me your hand. What? Oh, whoa. Ooh. - All right. - Ronan, you have to put me down. This is, yeah. - Sorry. - I don't want you to hurt yourself. - I'm okay. Almost home. Okay, I'm gonna... Here, I got it. - Watch your hand. Come on. Come sit down. - Thank you. Pretty lady. - Ooh. Hi, I'm Maya. I'm here for the registry. All right, thank you. This is so old school. It's so cute. - Thanks. - Oh, I just wanna look at clothes. - Look at this little one. - Cute. Cute. Hi. Hi. - Oh. This is so cute. - Yeah. - What do you think? We might as well just add it, right? Just because we can. - Sure. - You're not feelin' it? - No, I like it okay. - Why just okay? - Oh, I don't know. Uh. - What? - I don't know, it's just... - What? - I don't really know this kid yet. How do I know what clothes to buy him? - Well, he is a baby. We'll be making some decisions for him. - Yeah, I guess. - Besides, this is the fun part of having a baby. You know, I don't think we have to get too deep or existential about it. - I know, babe. I'm just glad you're finally feeling okay and that you're happy. - Thank you. - Oh yeah. - Ronan, you don't have to do that. - Yes, I did. - Mmm. Ah. Ow. Uh. Oh. - You okay? - Really hurts. Ah, mmm. - Should I call the doctor? - No, no, no, it's fine. - Actually, I read online that some pain is normal after an amnio unless you have spotting. You have spotting? - No, I'm fine. Ronan, serious, lay down next to me. Okay. - Just lay here. - All right. - You're so, you're so close to my face. Just relax. - Okay. - Oh. - You're not gonna eat that or... - You know, why don't you, why don't you get started? - Went a little overboard, eh? - Yeah, you're, someone needs to eat their feelings. - Oh. So, so pretty. - Uh-huh. - Wouldn't that look amazing with like a light, purple wall? What do you think? - A purple wall? - Yeah, it's so pretty. - Isn't he gonna sleep in our room for a little while? - Yeah, but he still needs his own room for like his toys and clothes and stuff. - So that's not gonna be my room anymore. - I assume, or maybe we have to move. - What? How are we gonna afford to move? What are you ta... - I don't know, I'm just trying out ideas. - No, you're kind of taking over everything. - How am I taking over? - Ah, you're making all of these decisions without me. - Like what? We're here together and I'm asking for your feedback. - No, like this whole baby shower thing, for example. - Yeah, but it's not like you were gonna do that. - Right, or this room thing, all of a sudden. - No decisions have been made about the room. - What about the baby's name? Are you gonna tell me what that is? - Why do you always go down this deep, dark path? - I'm not going down a dark path. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm just trying to point out... - You're just picking a fight. - Oh, I'm just pointing out how bossy you're being. - Oh, screw you, Ronan. - Maya. Great. Maya. Ronan? Ronan, wake up. What's happening, what's happening? - I'm wet, it's wet everywhere. - Is it, is it pee? No, it's, it's like a fluid. Did you, is your water breaking? It's early for that. No, no, no, it's, I'm leaking. Well, oh, oh, okay. Okay, no problem. I read about this online. - Wait, no, no, no. Here, just help me up, help me up. Okay, okay. Okay. - Here we go. Ah, ah, let's go to the hospital, okay? - No, let's call the doctor first. Okay, all right, you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay. Dr. Chen, Dr. Chen. - Ronan, hurry. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm calling, I'm calling. Okay. - Maya, are you... Really? Hello? Are you kidding me? Pick up the phone, Maya. - What? Maya. - What do you want? I'm sorry, okay? - Oh, you're sorry? Yes, just come back and we can talk this out. - Ronan, I'm not coming back there. Okay, well then what do you expect me to do? - Oh, I don't know, just Uber it. Maya. - Hey. - Hi. - Wanna talk about it? - No. - Wanna sit down? - Yeah, I do actually. - Did you want some tea or coffee? What about water? - Oh, that'd be great, thanks. Oh. - You comfy? - Yeah, thanks. Mmm. I just wanna go have some fun. - Like what? - I don't know. Just anything. - Do you need to get Ronan? - No. - Is he still at the store? - He'll be fine. - Maya. - What, I'm not worried about it. He was being a complete jerk. I mean, it's almost like he's trying to sabotage this. - No. - Not consciously, but on this deep, dark level. - Have you told him about this theory? - No, and I don't think he'd be able to change anyway. It's just, he has these big emotions. He goes from like one emotion to the next and it's just really exhausting. - It's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Except it gets activated in a baby store, which makes it really confusing. - Feel like a lot of guys might feel like this. - I don't know, I just need a break. - Should we get outta here? - Yes. - It's pretty much a perfect day. - I know. Guess I picked a good day to get into a fight, huh? - Yeah. This is a Maya day. That's what we're doing right now. We're having a Maya day. Want a sip? - Sure. Thanks. - More? - What's in this one? - You know, just a little somethin', somethin' extra. - Guess a little sip can't hurt. - No. It's refreshing. - Maya? Ruby. Hey. - Chance. Hey. - Hi. - Hey. Wow. Mmm, how are you? - Damn, it's been ages. - It has, man. Wow. Are you... - Oh, yup. Yeah. - Holy shit! - Yeah. I don't know if I told you. I started seeing this guy Ronan. Yeah, I'm due in four and a half months, so. - Well, I was gonna ask you ladies if you wanted to come by my place. I'm having like a thing later, but I... - Oh yeah, so we're not invited? - No, no, no, no, no. Of course you're invited. I mean, come over later. - Really? - Yeah. - No, I was joking, Chance. I wouldn't do that to you. - Um, that's my girlfriend. I gotta go. God, she's so pretty. She's super cute. She is super hot. - All right, well, I gotta get goin'. Good seeing you. Go, but... - Yeah, get it. - Okay, go. - Later, bye. - Oh my God! He didn't know you were pregnant? - No. I haven't told a lot of people. - You didn't tell him? - No, really, it wasn't serious. - Still, you didn't tell Chance? - Uh God, no, the last time I saw him it was so bad. I was so over him and dating and... - And here you are leaving your man at the store. - I'm an asshole. I feel bad. - I think my job here is done. See you guys later. - Thank you. May I? - Yeah, of course. - Okay, just checking. You abandoned me. - Yeah, can we just move on from that? - Okay, but you did abandon me. - Yeah, Ronan, I just needed a break. - Okay, okay. Do you want to do this because we're gonna fight sometimes. - Ronan, please, seriously. - Ah, we're having a bit of an emergency here. Ah, her, she's leaking quite a bit of clear liquids. It really hurts. - And she's cramping, she's cramping quite a bit. Where in your abdomen does it, does it hurt? - The bottom and all of the side, too. - Yeah, on the bottom and on the side, too. Uh-huh. Does it feel like you're going into labor? - I don't know. I've never been in labor before. I don't know. - She doesn't know. We've never been in labor. Uh, like a menstrual cramp. - Like a really terrible one. - Yeah, shit, okay. Okay, yeah, no problem. - It hurts really bad. - Hey. Hey! Maya. Maya, just hold on a second. Maya! I'm sorry. - Sorry, too. - Will you have a picnic with me? - Okay. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, that's no problem. Thank you, thank you. Okay, yeah, thanks. What did they say? - Yeah, okay, Maya? We're going to the hospital. Yeah? So, here. Help you up here. You okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm gonna, where are your shoes? Over by the bed. I'm gonna, it's okay. - Yeah, yeah. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Here. She's had cramping and loss of amniotic fluid. Let's continue to monitor her overnight. Yeah, of course. - All right. What? - I really think we should tell our parents. - I mean, I wish your parents could be here today, but... - It's not in the budget, Maya. - I know, Ronan, I know. - But we could start by telling yours. Or Ruby or somebody. I mean, why are we even having this shower in the first place? - It's just something we have to do. They're all really excited. Can we just... - Okay, but if our tests come back and there's an issue, we're gonna have to tell them. - Well, what if he's fine and all he has is a hand difference? - This is our family. I'm not sure what you're expecting, that we're just gonna show up one day with this kid that has issues? - We don't want people to treat him differently just because he has a hand issue, right? - But he is different. - No, he's not. I mean, plenty of people overcome these situations all the time. I mean, the hand issue sucks, yes, but otherwise he's just a normal baby. - It could be something more serious, Maya. - I don't think he has that. I really don't. - Maya. Can we promise each other that if it's something serious, we'll do what it right? Maya. - What? What do you mean by what is right? - You know what I mean. - No, I don't, actually. Please explain it to me. - If it's serious, then we'll end it. End it? Yes. - End it? End it what, like it's just a bad dinner date? This is our baby, Ronan. He's 20 weeks old. He's the size of a grapefruit. I feel him kicking inside of me every day. And I want to name him Ethan. Can I have that choice, at least? Okay, let's just, one day at a time, okay? - Right. All right? Let's just get through today. - That's what I'm saying. Okay, fine. - Okay. - Later. - All right, here we go. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? Oh. - Thank you. Thank you for being here. Hi. - Hi. Thank you for inviting me. - Thank you. So do you. I don't feel pretty right now. - Look who it is, my parents to be. Hi Mom, nice to see you. Hi, sweetheart. - Hi. Hi, how are you? - What's this? I love it, I love it, darling. - Ronan. - Hello, sir. Good to see you. - Well, what's up, buddy? - How you doin'? - Where are the cigars and champagne? - Oh, I, ah, I didn't... - Yeah, yeah, a baby shower's not your thing. - Sophie, honey. Yes, darling. - Would you please go and get a drink for Ronan? That's okay. - Something strong. - Mmm, mmm. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, here, come on. I know where the good stuff is. Yeah, he does. - Talk to you for a minute. Okay. - Hi. - Hi, oh. Thank you. This is beautiful. - I wish I could say this was all me, but honestly it was mostly your mom. - Mmm, that does not surprise me one bit. But you made good on your promise, right? - What promise is that? - None of those weird games where you like wrap me in toilet paper or name games or anything like that. - Oh, no, no, no. I totally promise, no games. - Please. - Oh, Helen, hey! - How are you kids? - We're ah, you know. Yeah? - You know, we're excited and nervous. We're hangin' in there. - Well good, well good. And you and Maya are fine? - Yeah, you know, we're gettin' there. - I'm glad you included us in this, I mean, because we didn't make it to the wedding. Ah, that was, you know, she, she wanted a private thing. - Well, okay. I know, I know, but I took a lot of selfies for you guys. - All right. Ah, Ronan, you're a good guy. - Oh, thank you, sir. I'll talk to you. - Maya! Maya papaya! Hi, Aunt Paige. - Mwah! How is my little nephew to be? - Oh, he's fine, Aunt Paige, fine. - Well, you let him know that his Auntie Paige can't wait to meet him. - I will. Oh, my baby. - Well, you see, I'm gonna check out the presents. - Okay. Hi! - Hi, hi, hi, hi. - Mwah! Thank you for that. Paige] Aw, so tell me. What are some of those baby names you're thinking about? - Oh, gosh, I don't want to... - Oh, come on. You can tell your Auntie Paige. Well, uh. Hi. There you are. - Hi, Mom. - Hi. Oh, you look beautiful, darling. Look at your beautiful party, darling. Mmm, are you having a good time? - Yeah, thank you. - Did you get a chance to say hello to the Petersons? - No, not yet. - You know, Raina, she keeps bragging about her daughter married this famous writer, and I keep saying, well, my daughter is a writer. I said that. - Doesn't really matter what... - How about Polly and Chris. Have you had a chance to say hi? - No, not yet. - Oh God. He's already on his fifth drink. Oh, geez. He's pathetic. - Mmm-hmm. - Are you gonna have a drink, babe? - No, Mom, I can't drink, I'm pregnant. - Have a little wine. Sip on a little tequila. It'll relax you. All these stupid warnings these days. Mmm, let me tell you somethin'. In my time women smoked, drank, and their kids turned out perfectly fine. - Mmm-hmm. - People nowadays just worry about every little thing. - Yeah. We're not gonna be like that. - No. - Oh, I'll be right back, honey. Carol? - Okay. Where are ya? Oh, there you are, sweetie. How are ya? I love that color on you. - Oh my God, congratulations. - Oh, thank you. - It's a boy, right? - Yeah. - Boys are the best. - Sorry. - Oh, wow, you look amazing. Oh, thank you. - When's your due date again? - Ah, ah, November 10th. - Oh, lucky you, you Scorpio. Ah, yeah. - You look great, you're doing great. Thanks. - You are not even big yet. - Oh, thanks, I think. - I don't mean it's a bad thing or anything. It's just, you know, some women get huge. Do you know his name yet or what his weight is? - Um, yeah. I'm sor, I'm so sorry. I have to use, I have to use the bathroom. I'll be right back. - Oh, oh, okay. Okay, thanks. Oh yeah, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. I've done that too with Soma. Have you guys found that Soma site? - Oh yeah, yeah. The material's like super comfy. - That's awesome. Really? Yeah, it's the best. - Excuse me. Oh, okay, sure. - Excuse me one second. Sure, no problem. Maya? Are you okay in there? Do you need help with anything? - Just using the bathroom. - Um, hi. What's going on? - Nothing, I was using the bathroom. - That doesn't seem that way. What do you mean? - Okay, your husband's out there standing around like a zombie, and you're in here locked in the bathroom. Did you guys get into another fight or something? - No. - Maya, what's wrong? Are you okay? - Nothing, I'm fine. - I mean, I know you really didn't want all of this. - No, no, it's fine. - Is Ronan getting cold feet or something? - No. - Is it your mom? She's just super excited. - Ruby. - What? - Ruby, something's wrong with the baby. - What? - The doctor, they, they don't know what, exactly. They think something might be wrong and I had to get all this testing done. - Oh my God. I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's really scary. And no one knows. Like, my parents don't even know. - I'm really sorry. - It's just we don't want them to know 'cause it's just, it's, it's so stressful. - I won't say anything. - You know, but mostly because we don't even know what it is exactly. - Well, what did they say? - Something about his, like, fingers, his hands, his chest not measuring correctly. Measuring correctly? - Yeah, it's hard to explain, but they think it may be like a genetic thing. - But nothing's been confirmed yet, right? - No. - Then relax. Sure everything's fine. You know, I've heard that these tests come out sometimes completely flat out wrong. - Oh, like, Ruby, like something's really wrong. The doctor diagnosed something. - But he's gonna be okay. I'm sure. Just don't worry so much. Come on, just enjoy today. Okay? It'll be fun. - Okay. - Okay. Come on. - All right, everybody. It's time for the cake. Isn't that beautiful? We just wanna let you guys know that we love you guys, we want to celebrate you guys. - Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. - And we can't wait to meet the little guy. Congratulations. Did you see that? Isn't that beautiful? - Ronan? - Yup. - I love you. - I love you. - I got a message from the doctor today. - What? Why didn't you tell me? - I just didn't wanna check it. Just wanted to wait, enjoy the day. - Okay, all right. What? Hi, Maya, this is Dr. Chen. Listen, we got your results back. Can you make an appointment so we can go over them? - Shit. - What? - That's not good. - Well, we don't know that. - She would've said something. - Well, let's not jump to conclusions. - You're right. All right, okay. Make the appointment. - I will. Maya. - Ronan. What do you want? - It's for the baby. - Um. Ah. - Ah, no, no, no. Please, I want you to keep that. - Oh, I don't, I don't want it. - Maya, I've been calling you for awhile now. - I'm sorry. You think you can just show up and just... - No, no, that's, no, no, no. - You did leave me alone and... - Maya, the reason I asked you here was so that I could tell you in person that I'm sorry. - You're sorry? Do you have any... I thought that we were in love. - I tried to tell you. - We had no choice. - Yes, we did. - No, we didn't. - That's because you had already decided. - Well, you did, too, apparently, so. - How is he? - Um, he's perfect. - Oh, ah, wait. Could I see him? Please. Just, I, whenever you're ready. It's not a rush. - I mean, I can't, I can't do this. Ronan, I mean, you're such a coward. Just take this. - Ah. Take it Maya. - Goodbye. Ah. Positive thoughts. I'm trying. - So. Well, I have good news and some, some bad news. - Do you mind if we do the good news first? Is that okay with you? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. - Well, your microarray came back completely clean. - So that means there's nothing wrong with the baby? - Is that what that means? - What this means is that he doesn't have any of the chromosomal abnormalities we tested for, and there were thousands, so this is very, very good news. There's nothing in his genetic code that shows any kind of immediate issue. - Oh my God, that's awesome. - And what's the bad news? - So we have to be cautiously optimistic. Your baby still definitely has the hand difference, but his chest measurements are looking consistent, like he is growing on his own curve, but we are still a bit concerned and want you to get an MRI and come in every two weeks to get measured so we can make sure. - And what if he is? - Is what? - Growing, growing on his own curve. - Well, then he's fine. Just a hand difference. - And, and plenty of people have hand differences. I mean, he can maybe even be fitted with a prosthetic. - That's right. - And what if he's not? - Well, let's say for now he is. There's no issues with any of his internal organs from what we can tell presently. But there is still the possibility of a syndrome that can't be detected with in utero testing. - And when will we know for sure? - Only when he's born. - Thank you. So have you thought of any other names yet? - No. I feel like I'll know when I see him. - Yeah. Okay, but right now the contenders are Ethan, Liam, Paul or Garrett. - Yup. Maybe, maybe something totally different like Ezekiel. - Really? - Yeah. - That's super biblical. Oh, okay. We'll put it on the list. - We can paint the room in that purple you always wanted. - I don't know. I'm kind of open to other colors now. - But no dark gray, though, right? Although I do, I have to admit that color sort of does go with everything. - I just, I don't know. I think it's way too intense for a baby. And you know what? I actually, when I get the crib that my mom's buying us in gray, so. - Maybe purple is best, huh? We'll see. - Bagel? - No, I'm good, thanks. It's okay our son has a hand difference. Right? - Right. - He'll be okay. - I know. - You should really join the Facebook page. - You're on there? - It's been really helpful. It's just nice to connect with other parents. I just, I just wanna be prepared. - I'm buzzing. No way. - What? - Derek and Eileen are at this birthday party down by the picnic tables. - Oh, cute. - Well, you down to go say hello? - If you're feelin' it. Yeah, let's go. - Are you? Really. - Okay. - Don't you do that. Lot of kids. Hey, hi. - Oh, excuse me. Hey! Maya, wow, look at you! Oh my God, how far along are you? - Almost 24 weeks. - Halfway there. Wow, congratulations. - Thank you. Oh, thanks, thanks Eileen. Oh wow, you look beautiful. - Oh, thanks, so do you. Thanks for comin'. - This is, ah, this is nuts. Oh, look who came to say hello! Hi five. - Okay, hi five. Hi five, down low. Too slow. - Are you serious? I gotcha this time. Uh. Come on! - Good luck! Duck, duck, goose, everybody! - So, how are you feeling? - Ah, I feel okay now. But I just can't believe I'm actually gonna get bigger. - The joys of being female. - Duck, duck, goose, everybody! Whose birthday this is? - Look at Ronan. He'll be a great dad. - Yeah, he's pretty dedicated. And apparently he wanted to be a dad his whole life, so. - Really? - Yeah. When we first started dating, he actually told me that not wanting to have kids was a deal breaker. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - And you still dated him? - Yeah. Duck, duck, duck. Goose. - I don't know. I was always kind of ambivalent about the kid thing. - Were you? - I fell in love. So in love and Derek came along. - Duck, Ronan, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, double duck, duck, double duck. Duck. Duck. Double duck. - Must be really hard, though, to raise a kid on your own? - It's not easy. - Did you ever consider, um, not having him? - No. Derek is hands down the best thing that's ever happened to me. - Duck, goose! - Duck goose? I'm gonna get you! - It's hard sometimes, but still, I mean, all the discomfort you're feeling now is completely temporary. - Yeah, I, I don't know. Things are just so up and down with Ronan right now. - That's normal. - I'm gonna get you! I got longer legs! - Stop, stop, stop! Sit down. Duck. - I just, I don't, I don't know how you do it alone. - You just do. No. Duck, duck, duck.
