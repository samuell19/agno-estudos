A MELS RESTORATION PRESENTATION The digitization of this film preserves all the attributes of the original work. It was achieved thanks to The Memory of Quebec Cinema Today, Madeleine flew, alone, for the first time. Her first time seeing her father, in Germany, for the summer holidays. THE THREE MADELEINES She adored my mania for capturing people I loved. We spent hours together, building our recollection. Everyone in it had, in some way, been a part of our life. Like a game, we captured them and put them in jars. From then on, they lived with us, in our house, forevermore, and we called them "our ghosts." Somewhere between dream and reality… we were time-travelling. Here and there on the road or by the sea, we would encounter our haunting ghosts. Madeleine thought she'd see her father at every turn, and I, as I discovered my mother's face for the first time, I reminded her of her lover, whom she'd always loved, despite her era's taboos. What's taking you? Mado's waiting for us. - Come on! - But… No "buts"! - Got everything? - Yep. Over 30 years of separation, over 30 years of memories to share. Here. And we're off! Mado, Madeleine and I left for the Gaspé. It was in July, last year. I was going to shoot on Bonaventure. Madeleine was already fascinated by the crazy birds that returned there annually. Madeleine had always accompanied me in my work, far from home. Then, Mado joined us. As far as P'tite-Vallée, where her friend, Léonard, was expecting her. I'd insisted that Mado come with us. I wanted to know her. Now I wasn't so sure. It was usually just the two of us, and Mado's presence bothered me. Mado's memory, her recollections, pictures, fears… The fear in her blood. Mado had passed her fear on to me: the phobia of losing my daughter and having only memory left to console me. Knowing a little about Mado, and about myself, so Madeleine knows who she is. I had to talk with Mado, ask her the questions that haunted my childhood. I already knew I'd learn nothing. Mado would invent a story, a story from memory. She'd embellish the past and the people she loved. Look at those almond things. Take six of each. - Twelve? - They'll get eaten. My dad's German too. So you spent your childhood here. Mostly by the river, on the shore. What did you do? Dreamed. Made up stories. You spent your time dreaming. It shows. I liked the way Mado… looked at me. As though to capture the past in a moment, scrutinize the present, go headlong into the future. She'll remember me. I'll enter her memory as a child. She'll think of me day after day without knowing where her image, her identity, her memory went. Gone travelling… Then, she'll forget. Madeleine's memory echoes with her father's voice. Just his voice. She remembered his voice. Voices calling out to her, murmuring… from across the sea. I found Mado a year ago now. A year ago, I discovered my estranged mother, an unfamiliar woman. She watched my every gesture for an expression of herself, and a trace of her story. From the first, she invited me to stay forever in her memory. But we needed time… to piece things together. We needed lots of time. Maybe it would take another 30 years. Mado was resuming a life shrouded in amnesia and anonymity. All the jumbled images in her mind. I was suddenly entering her memory and her story. These are my brothers working as loggers. Did you bring photos? I have one of my daughter. What's her name? Madeleine. Like me. Watch the photographs. Eat. If you're like me, you didn't have breakfast. Thanks. Bon appétit. Handsome fellow. Your father was handsome too. - Nice car, huh, Gérard? - Thank you. Clean too. Lucky you. We shouldn't be late. Mom will be waiting. - I'll take you home. - That'd be nice. - How do I look? - Lovely. - You too! - My Mado's beautiful. - Wonder if Albert will be there. - Yeah! Your Albert… - Not "my Albert"! - We know! Know what? Go on. I'll stay here. After our first meeting, I went back to Mado's house a few times. Mado always asked me to park my car far behind the trees. She wanted to avoid indiscreet stares. Much later, I learned she always asked Gérard to park far away. Far behind. Gérard had another life, and I reminded her of the man she'd loved, despite the taboos of her era. Now I was sure Mado was still in love with Gérard. The very idea of kissing him again filled her with joy. Finished? Yes. Anything else? A long espresso, please. You little hussies. Mama… It's Mado, Mama. I wish you'd let us both stay with you. Cécile! Thérèse! Rollande. Mado insisted on showing me where she spent most of her time. She wanted me to understand what her life was like: shut in silence… the feminine silence of an era ruled by God. Women had to learn to hide in order to live a little. Mado learned the hard way you don't fool with God. You obey Him. I spent my childhood imagining the day Mado would come for me. Today, she looked past me when we crossed paths. She must have forgotten how intensely I'd missed her. Mado forgets to avoid suffering. I'm someone who seeks endlessly so as not to suffer. Madeleine, my daughter, simply makes up another story. She reinvents another memory. Did she hope her mother might trick God by giving this infant her name? Mado left, arms and belly empty. That day, Mado broke definitively with God. Like a rock containing many lives, Mado was transfixed, not moving, weeping, crying out. Fate had struck and Mado was immobilized. Is it far? Just this far. My dad lives here. That day, Mado started living beside her life. Now I was the one who was afraid to smash into this immobility, and not find any of the stories I'd dreamed of, or Mado's characters, whom I'd invented. Mado! Whatcha up to? Where are you going? - The Gaspé! - Us too! - Really! - See you there! Bye! That's Bob, my neighbour. Hello, is this the conservation centre? I'd like to speak to Pierre… Yes. Thank you. Mr. Desjardins, Marie-Madeleine Pelletier. Yes, like in the Bible. What do you… What do you mean? Wait a second. Yes. The photographs… Yes, Bonaventure Island. As agreed. 35 mm and 2 1/4. Fine then. I thought so. Goodbye. It's unbelievable. Same mannerisms as your father. - Is that right? - Yes. The way you hold the phone, walk, hold your pencil. Yeah? I never saw him after, but I'll never forget him. Never again? - What's wrong? - I'll never find him again. I never hid a thing from you. - You have his photo! - This guy could be anyone. You look just like him. No, I look like you. I used to make up stories at your age: my eyes proved my mother was Vietnamese. Mado, Vietnamese? The war in Vietnam was always on TV. I was devising a way to extricate her from the war. - We'll talk about it. - When? - Soon. - And when's that? Come. Come here. I don't know why Mado claimed I resembled Gérard that day. I thought I resembled her more and more. Madeleine's mounting concern about not meeting her father. She started inventing another life… and another story across the sea. Hey. What's that sound? Léonard will wonder where we are. He can wait. - Can't get along without me. - Nice timing. We got a problem. Here, you'll get dirty. I'll do it. - How about a hand? - No. I was afraid for Madeleine… that she'd never find the stories she imagined or the father she'd reinvented over the years. And her growing demand to meet him… How can I explain, meeting him won't end the quest for identity and her life will be marked by a quest for truth? I rigged something up. It'll hold. It'll be fine till Percé. Go see my pal, George. The garage at the dock. Tell him I sent you. He'll fix it. Why are you so far from St. Hyacinthe? 'Cause of my daughter. She has work at Percé. She takes pictures. She asked me, I came. Daughter? Nice looking girl! It's not like you to hide things. OK, let's go. Thanks, Bob. My pleasure. When you visit your mother, check in on us. You know, I thought about you every day. I'll never again be able to confuse lies and truth. Even if, day after day, Mado struggled to forget, we had emerged for good from her long-kept secret. I wondered if finding her was the right thing after all these years. Gérard had faded into Mado's past. There I was reminding her of the man she always wanted to forget. I wanted to restore her pride, long since gone. But instead, our meeting seemed to expose her to harsh light, to greater vulnerability. I knew I forgot something. A little sun hat. Want me to show you the arms only? Had a nice day? You're soaked! What happened? A little accident, but it's fine now. Isn't my collection nice? Bird-watching is my favourite thing. Come here! Come, I'll show you something. Please don't touch. OK? - We're coming, Mado! - It's me, the owner. What is it? Your girl was playing with my birds, and now one's missing. What do you mean? The rarest one. I'd like to know where she put it. Right. Guess it just flew away. But my daughter couldn't have stolen it. Fine. Now I haven't had breakfast. I'd like a little something. There's some bread left. Thanks. Looks complicated, huh? Should have brought an Instamatic. That's not all. She puts the pictures in jars. - Who's that? - My dad. Imagine! In a jar. She put him in a jar. Hey, girls! Good, huh? Madeleine started trusting Mado, confiding our memory, my obsessions and her own. One June day, she met Léonard in a village near Gaspé. Since then, they meet every year in early summer. Sitting on the wharf, Léonard waited for Mado and her friendship. Like me, Léonard had been touched by this woman, whole-heartedly. Nice tune you're singing. Ah, Mado… Come sit down. The moon is beautiful. The sky is full of stars. See that? I think it's a fish. - Cold? - No. - Want my blanket? - Yes. - Nice hand… - You read palms? A little. Nice life line. And here… a nice love line. I'll play a tune. Our meeting, and this trip, were what Mado needed to love again and free body and heart from the past. I came here with Gérard. Where is she? - Go ahead. - Wait! Look what I got! - Twenty-five big ones! - Great! Get in, we're off. Getting to know Mado was like slowly finding a new way of loving. She had a simple, modest habit of expressing it. One look from her, and you knew she was full of generosity. This quality alone gave her the right to love. Her entire body was a refuge for those unloved. One day, Mado confided that Gérard loved fishing, that they met in a place like this to be together. So many lies… So many truths. - Mado… my Cocteau! - Sorry, didn't mean to… You startled me! - I'm glad to get a big one. - Us too. It'll taste great. Look what I found in my room! It's Percé. Very nice! You know the legend of Percé? I'll tell it to you. They say Percé is a petrified sea monster. All that's left is its huge eye, watching us. - Really! - Yeah. Blanche de Beaumont lived in a castle in Normandy. One fine June day, when she was 16, she arose at dawn. She couldn't sleep. She knew, that day, she was to meet her fiancé, the Knight of Nérac. Their encounter was like a starburst! Love at first sight. Until one day, the knight received the king's orders to leave for New France. Adieu, my fair one and my charmed life. In the New World, our hero braved cold, snow, scurvy, Indians. In France, Blanche pined away. Finally, she decided to find him. So she crossed the ocean. Suddenly… Pirates! About face! Battle stations! Land is far, no ship in sight! It's a raid! Pirates sack the ship, kill the crew. Horrors! One person is spared: Blanche, reserved for their captain. But when she learns this, she swears she'll never wed a pirate. The crew assembles on the bridge for the wedding. Blanche turns abruptly, runs and jumps overboard. They are stunned. When they come to their senses, Blanche has sunk to the depths. The next evening, a thick fog envelops the boat. Suddenly, a vision appears that fills them with horror. In the fog, they can distinguish the ghost of Blanche de Beaumont. The apparition reaches out towards the boat, and the boat turns into a rock! The Knight of Nérac died shortly after, in a battle between the French and the Iroquois. Some still say that when Percé is caught in fog, you can make out Blanche's ghost. But go see for yourself. Wait for us! What are you doing? I'm getting ready to cross the sea. Won't you drown? I'm sending a picture to my dad. - Where does he live? - Over there. Come on, let's throw this in. One, two, three… Hello, Léonard! Oh, wait! Your present. - A picture! - Sure. You look nice. Take care! - You too. - See you in four days. Have fun. Now, she'd be part of our lives. - Do you have a friend named Bob? - Hello. Yes, he called about your muffler. - Big problem. Marie. - Pleased to meet you. I'll take a look. Looks bad. What'll you do? He used scrap metal. It's finished. Bring it in. We'll see. - Drive inside. - Great. Am I having a vision? Marie-Madeleine? Yes. You're Pierre? Yes, I am. Hello. Pleased to meet you. This is Madeleine. Hello. Hello. Just "Madeleine"? Pierre's a biologist. He's coming. - You're loaded down. I'll help. - Please. We'll go see the gannets? Finally. Let's put this in the boat. See, Madeleine, for 43 days, they're busy incubating the eggs. Male and female take 36-hours shifts. If they accidentally leave the nest unwatched, it's destroyed by the others. Gannet behaviour ensures the nests are guarded. By raising its beak and showing the green lines on its feet, it says to its partner: "I want to leave, you stay." This species never abandons the nest. If both want to leave, they raise beaks alternately. The intensity of this movement reflects their desire to leave. Eventually, the less agitated bird gives up the idea of leaving and stays with the egg. Hey, look! Over 18,000 pairs of gannets make their nest on Bonaventure. Every spring, they meet again on the ledge. Always at the same place. Madeleine was fascinated by these mad birds. She believed their fidelity arose from the freedom, and that, because they're mad, they're capable of loving. - So many babies! - Sure. Madeleine had always had a desire to fly. I remember the day when she ran so fast that a bird nearly stopped before such naivete. She yelled so much, the whole flock turned back. As though performing a ritual, she was now preparing her flight. What are they doing? It's for recognition. They relay to protect the nest: when one leaves, the other guards. They're territorial. They stay in couples. When they trade shifts, they do that fencing. They recognize each other. Sometimes, it turns into a seduction. They nuzzle each other. Seems gannets are very faithful. - Faithful to the nest. - Really? To their nest. Not in bed. - They're nuzzling. - That they are. Nuzzling… In silence, Madeleine was performing a ritual… gradually freeing herself from the ghosts that haunted her. Madeleine, come here. That day, Madeleine asked if she could go. That day, my body resolved to let her go. Madeleine dreamed of seas and voyages. But like me, she needed to be anchored. Today, she'd decided to collage the pieces of her story and gradually build up her memory. - Like it? - Yeah. She forgot this yesterday. Here. That's why you came? I thought it might have some important photos… How did you find us? She told me where you're staying. Is that yours? Yes. It's my passion. It's really great. It drives well? Very well. It drives far? Yes. As far as Montreal. I have to finish packing. Here. Put your number here. I know my mother. She'll never ask. Our little secret. Have a good drive. Thanks. Madeleine was fragile at the idea of flying. She desperately sought someone else for me to love. She knew Pierre was like the people I always loved. He had the same charm as those I'd captured. His face bore the mark of an uncompromised life. How do I explain to her that nothing can replace our memory, nor the love she and I have built? Solid as rock, these will live on for eternity. That day, as planned, we met Mado on the wharf. Dear Mado, spending the trip telling me love stories, past and present… and restoring in me a taste for pleasure, so the scent of desire rose within me. In a way, she taught me to love freely. She knew loving was costly, yet she had never renounced it. Suffering dwelt in the silence surrounding Mado. In this suffering, she'd found the strength to carry on. Now, after all these years, Mado was slowly rediscovering her identity. Go on, love. Bon voyage. - I love you. - Me too. I wanted to reassure her before she left, telling her my meeting with Mado had forever dispelled my uncontrollable fear of losing our collective memory. But now I knew my life would consist in piecing together our story. And if need be, I'd stay anchored forever in the same place, at home. This way, as Madeleine came and went, she'd always find a bit of herself among all these people we had long loved and captured, and would from now on call, in memory of our past life, "the ghosts of the three Madeleines."
