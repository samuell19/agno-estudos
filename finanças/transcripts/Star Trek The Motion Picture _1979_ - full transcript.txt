Tactical. Visual. Tactical, stand by on torpedoes. Ready... Fire! Evasive! This is comm station epsilon lx calling u.S.S. Columbia. Come in, Columbia. Respond, please. This is epsilon ix, Columbia. Am boosting output. How read you this? Scout Columbia ncc-621, to rendezvous with scout revere ncc-595 on stardate 7411 .4. Further orders will be relayed at that time, signed commodore probert to starfleet. End of transmission. Lntruder unidentified. Believe luminescent cloud to be enormous power field surrounding alien vessel. Our sensor scans unable to penetrate. Imperial klingon cruiser amar, continuing to attack. Our sensor drone is intercepting this on quad I-14. That's within klingon boundaries. Who are they fighting? Unknown, sir. I have an exterior visual. We've plotted a course on that cloud, commander. It will pass into federation space fairly close to us. Heading? Sir, it's on a precise heading for earth. Our ancestors cast out their animal passions here on these sands. Our race was saved by the attainment of kolinahr. Kolinahr: Through which all emotion is finally shed. You have laboured long, Spock... Now receive from us this symbol of total logic. Your thoughts... give them to me. Our minds, Spock... one and together. This consciousness calling to you from space... It touches your human blood, Spock. You have not achieved kolinahr. His answer lies elsewhere. He will not achieve his goal with us. Live long and prosper, Spock. Commander sonak, you received your appointment as enterprise science officer? Based, I am told, on your recommendation, admiral. - Thank you. - Then why aren't you aboard? Captain Decker requested I complete final science briefing here - before we leave on our mission. - Here? At starfleet? The enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock. Which will require 20 more hours at minimum. Twelve. I'm on my way to a meeting with admiral nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the enterprise in one hour. Report to you, sir? It is my intention to be on that ship following that meeting. Report to me in one hour. - Admiral! - Mr Scott. Those departure orders, 12 hours, starfleet cannot be serious. Why aren't the enterprise transporters operating, mr Scott? A wee problem, sir. Just temporary. Admiral, we have just finished 18 months redesigning and refitting the enterprise. How in the name of hell do they expect me to have her ready in 12 hours? Take me over, please. She needs more work, sir. A shakedown. Mr Scott, an alien object of unbelievable destructive power is less than three days away from this planet. The only starship in interception range is the enterprise. Ready or not, she launches in 12 hours. The crew haven't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, they're not even tested at warp power. And an untried captain. Two and a half years as chief of starfleet operations may have made me a little stale, but I wouldn't exactly consider myself untried. - They gave her back to me, Scotty. - "Gave" her back, sir? Well, I doubt it was that easy with nogura. You're right. Well, any man who could manage such a feat, I would not dare to disappoint. She'll launch on time, sir. And she'll be ready. - Pod secured. - Thank you, mr Scott. - Aye, sir. - Pressure equalised. Attention, launch crew, a travel pod is now available at cargo six. - Permission to come aboard, sir. - Granted, sir. Welcome aboard, admiral. Commander Scott, you're needed in engineering immediately. Sir, you'll excuse me. Attention, launch crew. A travel pod is now available at cargo six. Travel pod available. Cargo six. Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll show you... I think I can find my way, ensign. Aye, sir. Bridge. What's the problem? I thought you people had that circuit patched in an hour ago! We did. We had to disconnect it again so we could tie in radio messaging. All right. Take out... All right, as soon as somebody can get to it. - What's the next programme? - Go ahead. I'll get somebody down there as soon as I can. Cleary, my people are all tied up now. Captain, starfleet just signalled your transfer-of-command order, sir. - Captain. - I appreciate the welcome. I wish the circumstances were less critical. Epsilon lx is monitoring the intruder. Keep a channel open to them. Aye, sir. Where's captain Decker? He's in engineering, sir. He... He doesn't know. - Mr Chekov. - Aye, sir. Assemble the crew on the recreation deck at 0400 hours. I want to show them what we're facing. Engineering to all decks, auxiliary power test in three minutes. Check cleary on number six. Engineering to all decks, auxiliary power test in three minutes. Mark. Space matrix restoration coils. Dilithium crystals. I knew it! The transporter sensor was not activated. Faulty modules. Cleary! Put a new backup sensor into the unit. Aye, sir. - Ready. - Emergency shut-down trip. Admiral kirk! Well, we're getting a top-brass sendoff. Don't worry. She'll launch on schedule, if we have to tow her out with our bare hands. - Right, Scotty? - Aye, that we will, sir. - Let's talk. - Sure. Let me know when that backup's ready. Aye, sir. All due respect, sir, I hope this isn't some kind of starfleet pep talk. I'm really too busy. I'm taking over the centre seat, will. You're what? I'm replacing you as captain of the enterprise. You'll stay on as executive officer, temporary grade reduction to commander. You, personally, are assuming command? Yeah. - May I ask why? - My experience. Five years out there dealing with unknowns like this. My familiarity with the enterprise, its crew. Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do! That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, will. No, admiral. I don't think you're sorry. Not one damn bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were and how much you hoped you'd find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way. Report to the bridge, commander, immediately. Aye, sir. Transporter room, come in! Urgent! Red line on the transporter, mr Scott. Transporter! Do not engage. - It's too late. They're beaming now. - Do not... Do you read me, starfleet? Override it. Pull them back. Unable to retrieve their pattern, enterprise. Malfunction! Malfunction! Malfunction! - Malfunction! Malfunction! - Give it to me! Malfunction! Starfleet, boost your matter gain. We need more signal. - More signal! - We're losing their pattern. Oh, no. They're forming. Oh, my god. Starfleet, do you have them? Enterprise, what we got back didn't live long. Fortunately. Starfleet, kirk. Please express my condolences to their families. Commander sonak's can be reached through the vulcan embassy. There was nothing you could have done, rand. It wasn't your fault. - Yeoman, turboshaft eight? - Back that way, sir. We have to replace commander sonak. I'd still like a vulcan there, if possible. None available, captain. In fact, there's no one who's fully rated on this design. You are, mr Decker. I'm afraid you're gonna have to double as science officer. That's all we know about it. Except that it is now 53.4 hours away from earth. Enterprise is the only federation starship that stands in its way. We assume that there is a vessel of some type at the heart of the cloud. Our orders are to intercept, investigate and take whatever action is necessary and possible. We can only hope that there is a life form aboard that vessel that reasons the way we do. Bridge to captain. Priority signal from epsilon lx. - Put it on viewer. - On viewer, sir. Enterprise. The cloud is definitely a power field of some kind. Measures... My god! Over 82 aus in diameter. Must be something incredible inside there generating it. We're transmitting linguacode friendship messages on all frequencies. No response. I have a null reading at the centre of the cloud. Definitely something inside there, but all scans are being reflected back. - Some kind of power surge. - Receiving an odd pattern now! Enterprise, they could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act. They seem to be reacting to our scans, sir. Deflectors, emergency full! - We are under attack! - External view. Viewer off. Viewer off! Pre-launch countdown will commence in 40 minutes. Photon torpedo load status. Transporter system fully repaired and functioning normally, sir. Dock signals clear, captain. Reply we are holding position awaiting final crew replacements. Aye, sir. Transporter personnel reports the navigator, lieutenant llia, she's already aboard and en route to the bridge, sir. She's deltan, captain. - Lieutenant llia reporting for duty, sir. - Welcome aboard, lieutenant. - Hello, llia. - Decker. I was stationed on the lieutenant's home planet some years ago. Commander Decker? Yes, our exec and science officer. Captain kirk has the utmost confidence in me. And, in you, too, lieutenant. My oath of celibacy is on record, captain. - May I assume my duties? - By all means. Captain? Starfleet reports our last six crew members are ready to beam up, but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter. Oh? I'll see to it that he beams up. Transporter room. Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to the starfleet... Just a moment, captain, sir. I'll explain what happened. Your revered admiral nogura invoked a little known, seldom used reserve activation clause. In simpler language, captain, they drafted me. They didn't. This was your idea. This was your idea, wasn't it? Bones, there's a thing out there. Why is any object we don't understand always called a "thing"? Headed this way. I need you. Damn it, bones. I need you. Badly! - Permission to come aboard? - Permission granted, sir. Well, Jim. I hear chapel's an md now. Well, I'm going to need a top nurse. Not a doctor who'll argue every little diagnosis with me. And they probably redesigned the whole sickbay, too. I know engineers. They love to change things. Dock control reports ready, sir. - Helm ready, sir. - Orbital departure on plot, sir. Yard command signalling clear, sir. Manoeuvring thrusters, mr sulu. - Manoeuvring thrusters, sir. - Hold station. Thrusters at station-keeping, sir. Thrusters ahead, mr sulu. Take us out. Intermix set, bridge. Impulse power at your discretion. Impulse power, mr sulu. Ahead warp 0.5. - Departure angle on viewer. - Departure angle. - Viewer ahead. - Viewer ahead. Captain's log, stardate 7412.6, 1 .8 hours from launch. In order to intercept the intruder at the earliest possible time, we must now risk engaging warp drive while still within the solar system. Captain, assuming we have full warp capability, accelerating to warp 7 on leaving the solar system will bring us to lp with the intruder in 20.1 hours. Science officer's computation confirmed, sir. Well, bones, do the new medical facilities meet with your approval? They do not. It's like working in a damned computer centre. Programming ready? Programme set for standard warp entry, captain, but I still recommend further simulation study. Mr Decker, every minute brings that object closer to earth. Engineering, stand by for warp drive. Captain, we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors. Engineer, we need warp speed now. Jim? You're pushing. Your people know theirjobs. That's it, sir. I can't do any better. Aye, lad. It's borderline on the simulator, captain. I cannot guarantee that she'll hold up. Warp drive, mr Scott. - Ahead, warp 1, mr sulu. - Accelerating to warp 1, sir. Warp 0.7. 0.8. Warp 1, sir. - Mr Decker... - Emergency alert! Emergency alert! Emergency alert! Wormhole! Get us back on impulse power! Full reverse. Emergency alert! Emergency alert! Negative helm control, captain. Going reverse on impulse power! Subspace frequencies jammed, sir! Wormhole effect! Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22.5 seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed! Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, captain, directly ahead! Force fields up full. Put object on viewer. - Go manual override on helm! - No manual response, sir. Navigational deflectors coming up, sir. Wormhole distortion has overloaded the main power systems. Navigational deflectors inoperative, captain. Directional control also inoperative. Time to impact? Twenty seconds. Mr Chekov, stand by on phasers. No! Belay that phaser order! Arm photon torpedoes! Photon torpedoes armed! Object is an asteroid, reading mass 0.7. Targeting asteroid! Impact in ten seconds. - Impact in eight seconds. - Fire torpedoes! Six... - Torpedoes away! - Seconds. Four! We're out of it! Helm control restored, sir. - Position report, navigator. - Computing new intersection course. Communications are normal, sir. Negative damage reported, captain. No casualties reported, doctor. Wrong, mr Chekov, there are casualties. My wits! As in "frightened out of," captain, sir. We're at warp 0.8. Engineer, report your status there. In just a second, exec. We're picking up the pieces down here! Mr Scott, we need warp drive as soon as possible. Captain, it was the engine imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it. That object is less than two days away from earth. We need to intercept while it still is out there. Navigator, lay in a new heading to conform with our initial lp with the intruder. Mr sulu, you have the conn. Mr Decker, I'd like to see you in my quarters. Mind if I tag along, captain? Level five. All right, explanation. Why was my phaser order countermanded? Sir, the enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channelling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off. Then you acted properly, of course. Thank you, sir. I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. - You saved the ship. - I'm aware of that, sir. Stop competing with me, Decker! - Permission to speak freely, sir? - Granted! Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's redesign, in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardises this mission. I trust you will nursemaid me through these difficulties, mister? Yes, sir, I'll do that. Then I won't keep you from your duties any longer, commander. - Yes, doctor? - Aye, sir. He may be right, Jim. Was it difficult? No more than I expected. About as difficult as seeing you again. I'm sorry. That you left delta lv? Or that you didn't even say goodbye? If I had seen you again, would you have been able to say it? No. Make your point, doctor. The point, captain, is that it's you who's competing. You rammed getting this command down starfleet's throat. You've used this emergency to get the enterprise back. And I intend to keep her, is that what you're saying? Yes. It's an obsession. An obsession that can blind you to far more immediate and critical responsibilities. Your reaction to Decker is an example, Jim. - Bridge to captain. - Viewer on. Signal from a federation-registered long-range shuttle, sir. She wishes to come alongside and lock on. For what purpose? My security scan shows it has a grade 1 priority, captain. Non-belligerency confirmed. I suspect it is a courier of some kind. Very well, mr Chekov. See to it. Viewer off. Your opinion has been noted. Anything further? That depends on you. Security scan. One boarder. Identity, starfleet. Inactive. Permission to come aboard, sir. Granted, sir! Granted. - Why, why, it's Mr... - Spock! Spock. Commander, if I may? I've been monitoring your communications with starfleet command, captain. I'm aware of your engine design difficulties. I offer my services as science officer. With all due respect, commander. If our exec has no objections? Of course not. I'm well aware of mr Spock's qualifications. Mr Chekov, log mr Spock's starfleet commission reactivated, list him as science officer, both effective immediately. Mr Spock! Well, so help me, I'm actually pleased to see you! It's how we all feel, mr Spock. Captain, with your permission, I will now discuss these fuel equations with the engineer. Mr Spock? Welcome aboard. Captain's log, stardate 7413.4. Thanks to mr Spock's timely arrival, and assistance, we have the engines rebalanced into full warp capacity. Repair time, less than three hours. Which means, we will now be able to intercept intruder while still more than a day from earth. Warp 0.8. 0.9. Warp 2, sir. Warp 3. Warp 4. Warp 5. Warp 6. Science officer Spock, reporting as ordered, captain. Please, sit down. Spock, you haven't changed a bit. You're just as warm and sociable as ever. Nor have you, doctor, as your continued predilection for irrelevancy demonstrates. Gentlemen. At last report, you were on vulcan, apparently to stay. Yes, you were undergoing the kolinahr discipline. Sit down. If you are referring to the kolinahr, doctor, you are correct. Well, however it's pronounced, mr Spock, it's the vulcan ritual that's supposed to purge all remaining emotions. The kolinahr is also a discipline you broke to join us. Will you please sit down? On vulcan I began sensing a consciousness from a source more powerful than I have ever encountered. Thought patterns of exactingly, perfect order. I believe they emanate from the intruder. I believe it may hold my answers. Well, isn't it lucky for you that we just happened to be heading your way? Bones! We need him. I need him. Then my presence is to our mutual advantage? Any thought patterns you might sense, whether they appear to affect you personally or not, I expect immediately reported. Of course, captain. Is there anything else? No. Jim? If this super-intelligence is as important to him as he says it is, how do we know... That he wouldn't put his own interests ahead of the ship's? I could never believe that. Bridge to officer's lounge. Captain kirk, revised estimate on cloud visual contact, 3.7 minutes. Red alert! Red alert! Standard light, engineer. - Full mag on viewer! - Full mag, sir. Linguacode? Continuing friendship messages on all frequencies, sir. All decks and divisions confirmed. Status red. - Captain, we are being scanned. - Do no return scan, mr Spock. It could be misinterpreted as hostility. Intruder scans emanating from the exact centre of the cloud. Energy of a type never before encountered. There's no response to friendship messages, sir. Shall I go to battle stations, sir? Negative. We'll take no provocative action. Recommend defensive posture, captain. Screens and shields. No, mr Decker. That could also be misinterpreted as hostile. Cloud composition, mr Spock? - Twelfth power energy field. - Twelfth power? Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution? - Mr Decker... - Captain. I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud. Mr Decker, I will not provoke an attack. If that order isn't clear enough for you... Captain, as your exec, it's my duty to point out alternatives. Yes, it is. I stand corrected. Five minutes to cloud boundary. Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path to the cloud centre. Bring us parallel to whatever we find in there. - Mr sulu, tactical plot on viewer. - Tactical on viewer, sir. That measures twelfth power energy? Thousands of starships couldn't generate that much... Mr Spock? Spock, tell me. I sense puzzlement. We have been contacted. Why have we not replied? Contacted? How? Standard on viewer. Force fields up full! Deflectors, now! Mark, zero. Incoming fire ahead. Force fields and deflectors up full, captain! Analysis, mr Spock. Alien weapon is a form of plasma energy, captain. Exact composition, unknown. Guidance system, unknown. All decks brace for impact. Registering power loss on force fields! Engineering, what's happening to our force fields? Systems overloading, captain! - Medic. - Medics are coming. The new screens held. Engineering to bridge. Cannot hold full power on force fields! Deflector power is down 70%! Divert auxiliary power to deflectors. Captain. The intruder has been attempting to communicate. Our previous transmission mode was too primitive to be received. I am now programming our computer to transmit linguacode at their frequency and rate of speed. Commander. Spock. Here it comes! Engineering! Status report! Our shields cannot handle another attack. Mr Spock! Impact in 20 seconds. Spock! 15 seconds! Spock! Transmit now! 10 seconds. Transmitting. It would seem our friendship messages have been received and understood, mr Spock. I would say that was a logical assumption, captain. - Mr sulu, hold present position. - Holding present position, sir. Tactical plot on viewer. Course projection on tactical, sir. - Opinion, mr Spock. - Recommend we proceed, captain. - Mr Decker? - I advise caution, captain. We can't withstand another attack. That thing is 20 hours away from earth. - We know nothing about it as yet. - Precisely the point, captain. We don't know what it'll do. Moving into that cloud at this time is an unwarranted gamble. How do you define "unwarranted"? You asked my opinion, sir. Viewer, standard ahead. Navigator, maintain course. Helmsman, steady as she goes. No vessel could generate a power field of this magnitude. Spock? Instruments fluctuating, captain. Patterns unrecognisable. Transmit image of alien to starfleet. Advise we are attempting further communication. Unable to make contact with starfleet, captain. Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud is being reflected back! We are closing on it rapidly, captain. Reduce magnification, factor four, mr sulu. We're already two settings below that, sir. Mr sulu, bring us into a parallel course over the alien at 500 metres. 500 metres? Then take us out to 100 kilometres distance, adjusting parallel course. Aye, sir. - Viewer astern. - Reverse angle on the viewer, captain. Five hundred metres. Viewer ahead, sir. Hold relative position here. Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Mr Spock, can that be one of their crew? A probe from their vessel, captain. Plasma, energy combination. Don't interfere with it! Absolutely, I will not interfere. No one interfere! It doesn't seem interested in us! Only the ship. Computer off! It's taken control of the computer. It's running our records! Earth defences! Starfleet strength! Ilia! This is how I define unwarranted. Activate auxiliary computer circuits through manual shutoff. Emergency alert! Negative control at helm! Force fields! Full remaining strength! Total reserve! This ship is under attack. Man all defensive stations. Captain, we've been seized by a tractor beam. Get someone up here to take the navigator's station. - Engineering! - Chief difalco, to the bridge! Emergency power! Going to full emergency! But, captain, if we don't break free in 15 seconds, she'll burn up! We cannot break free, captain. We have only a fraction of the power necessary. Engineering, belay that order. Disengage all main drive systems. Chief difalco, take over lieutenant llia's station. Difalco, disengage engine navigation relays now! Aye, sir. Force field circuits e 10 through 14 show ready for reactivation. Confirm, please. Scotty, drive systems should be free now. Commander? Ready to launch remote communications drone with complete ships records, including our present situation, sir. Delay launching as long as possible. Our drone can't escape as long as we're held in that tractor. Aye. Captain, a maximum phaser strike directly at the beam might weaken it just enough for us to break free. Break free to where, commander? Any show of resistance would be futile, captain. We don't know that, mr Spock. Why are you opposed to trying? Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us. They could have done that outside. They still can. Curiosity, mr Decker. Insatiable curiosity. Captain, photic sonar readings indicate the aperture is closing. We're trapped, sir. Reverse angle on the viewer, captain. Tractor beam has released us, captain. Confirmed. Vessel is floating free. No forward momentum. - Viewer ahead. - Viewer ahead, sir. Manoeuvring thrusters, mr sulu. Ahead one third. Thrusters ahead, one third. Let's take a look. Full sensor scan, mr Spock. They can't expect us not to look them over now. Now that we're looking down their throat. Right. Now that we've got them just where they want us. It's closing up. Hold position. Thrusters at station-keeping, sir. Captain? All our scans are being reflected back. Sensors are useless. Damn! What do you make of all this? I believe the closed orifice leads to another chamber. Undoubtedly, part of the vessel's inner mechanism. I suspect it may be necessary... - Intruder alert! Intruder alert! - Deck five, captain. Officer's quarters. Have security meet me at deck five! Main elevator! Spock! Mr Decker, you have the conn. - Hold position. - Intruder location, a Sonic shower. Temperature at intruder location, temperature drop rapid now. 60 degrees. 50 degrees. Temperature curve flattening. 45 degrees. 40 degrees. Temperature levelling, 39 degrees. You are the kirk-unit. You will assist me. Holding at 37.65 degrees. I've been programmed by v'ger to observe and record normal functions of the carbon-based units infesting u.S.S. Enterprise. Holding at 37.65 degrees. - Jim, what's going on? - Tricorder. Who is v'ger? V'ger is that which programmed me. Is v'ger the name of the captain of the alien vessel? - Jim, this is a mechanism. - A probe, captain. No doubt a sensor-transceiver combination recording everything we say and do. - Where is lieutenant llia? - That unit no longer functions. I've been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting enterprise. - Carbon-based units? - Humans, ensign Perez. Us. Why does v'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead? To find the creator. Find the creator? Whose... What does v'ger want with the creator? To join with him. To join with the creator? How? V'ger and the creator will become one. And who is the creator? The creator is that which created v'ger. - Who is v'ger? - V'ger is that which seeks the creator. I'm ready to commence my observations. Doctor, a thorough examination of this probe might provide some insight into those who manufactured it and how to deal with them. Fine. Let's get her to sickbay. I am programmed to observe and record only the normal functioning of the carbon-based units. The examination is a normal function. You may proceed. Micro-miniature hydraulics, sensors and molecule-sized multi-processor chips. And take a look at this. An osmotic micro-pump right here. And even the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated. Every exocrine system is the same, too. Even eye moisture. Decker. Fascinating. Not "Decker-unit"? Gentlemen. Will. What happened to her? Captain, this probe may be our key to the aliens. Probe? "Ilia"? Exactly. It is a programmed mechanism, commander. Its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real llia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision. - They had a pattern to follow. - Indeed. They may have followed it too precisely. Llia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, obedience, friendship might all be there! You did have a relationship with lieutenant llia, commander. That probe, in another form, is what killed llia! Commander! Will, we're locked in an alien vessel, six hours from earth orbit. Our only contact with our captor is that probe. If we could control it, persuade it, use it... I have recorded enough here. You will now assist me further. The Decker-unit can assist you with much greater efficiency. Carry on with your assignment, mr Decker. Aye, sir. I am concerned with that being our only source of information, captain. Captain's log, stardate 7414.1 . Our best estimates place us some four hours from earth. No significant progress thus far, reviving llia memory patterns within the alien probe. This remains our only means of contact with our captor. All those vessels were called enterprise. The carbon units use this area for recreation. This is one of the games. What types of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy? The words "recreation" and "enjoy" have no meaning to my programming. Ilia enjoyed this game. She nearly always won. Good. He's using audio-visual association. This device serves no purpose. Why does enterprise require the presence of carbon units? Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units. More data concerning this functioning is necessary, before carbon units can be patterned for data storage. What does that mean? When my examination is complete all carbon units will be reduced to data patterns. Within you are the memory patterns of a certain carbon unit. If I can help you to revive those patterns, you could understand our functions better. That is logical. You may proceed. I remember lieutenant llia once mentioning she wore that. On delta. Remember? Ilia? Doctor chapel. - Will? - Ilia. Commander. Commander. This is a mechanism. Ilia, help us make direct contact with v'ger. - I cannot. - This creator v'ger is looking for, - what is it? - V'ger does not know. Computer, commence recording. Captain kirk, these messages will detail my attempt to contact the aliens. Warning! Your emergency evacuation thruster pack has been armed. Once ignited, the burn duration is 10 seconds and may not be aborted. Push the igniter-enable release to begin a 10-second countdown to thruster ignition. To abort countdown, flip the control arm up. I intend to calculate thruster ignition and acceleration rate to coincide with the opening of the v'ger orifice. This should facilitate a better view of the interior of the alien spacecraft. Captain? Starfleet signals are growing in strength, sir. They still have the intruder on their monitors. It's decelerating. Confirmed, sir. Lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into earth orbit. Sir, airlock four has been opened. A thruster suit is reported missing. A thruster suit? That's Spock. Damn him. Bring him back here. No, wait! - Get a fix on his position. - Aye, sir! I have successfully penetrated the next chamber of the alien's interior, and I'm witnessing some sort of dimensional image, which I believe to be a representation of v'ger's home planet. I'm passing through a connecting tunnel. Apparently, a kind of plasma energy conduit, possibly a field coil for a gigantic imaging system. Curious. I'm seeing images of planets, moons, stars, whole galaxies, all stored here, recorded. It could be a representation of v'ger's entire journey. But who or what are we dealing with? The epsilon lx station, stored here with every detail. Captain, I am now quite convinced that all of this is v'ger. That we are inside a living machine. Ilia! The sensor must contain some special meaning. I must try to mind-meld with it. Spock! Spock! Spock! Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fibre connection. Indications of some neurological trauma. The power pouring through that mind-meld must have been staggering. - Spock. - Jim, I should have known. Were you right? About v'ger? A life form of its own. - A conscious, living entity. - A living machine? It considers the enterprise a living machine. That's why the probe refers to our ship as an entity. I saw v'ger's planet, a planet populated by living machines. Unbelievable technology. V'ger has knowledge that spans this universe. And yet, with all its pure logic, v'ger is barren, cold. No mystery. No beauty. I should've known. Known? Known what? Spock. - Captain. - Bones! Spock! What should you have known? What should you have known? Jim, this simple feeling is beyond v'ger's comprehension. No meaning. No hope. And Jim, no answers. - It's asking questions. - What questions? "Is this all that I am?" "Is there nothing more?" Bridge to captain. Kirk here. A faint signal from starfleet, sir. Intruder cloud has been located on their outer monitors for the past 27 minutes. Cloud dissipating rapidly as it approaches. Starfleet reports forward velocity has slowed to sub-warp speed. - We are three minutes from earth orbit. - I'll be right there. I need Spock on the bridge. Dalaphaline, five cc's. A machine planet sending a machine to earth, looking for its creator. It's absolutely incredible. Mr Chekov, commander Decker's present location? He... they are in engineering, sir. Captain, starfleet is sending this tactical on v'ger's position. V'ger is transmitting a signal. - Jim. - From v'ger. V'ger signals the creator. Spock? A simple binary code transmitted by carrier wave signal. Radio. Radio? Jim, v'ger expects an answer. An answer? I don't know the question. The creator has not responded. All planetary defence systems have just gone inoperative! Sir, starfleet computes the devices are proceeding toward equidistant positions, orbiting the planet. They're the same things that hit us. They are hundreds of times more powerful, captain. From those positions, they could devastate the entire surface of the planet. - Why? - The creator has not answered. The carbon-unit infestation is to be removed from the creator's planet. - Why? - You infest enterprise. You interfere with the creator in the same manner. Machine. V'ger. V'ger! Captain. V'ger is a child. I suggest you treat her as such. - A child? - Yes, captain. A child. Evolving, learning, searching, instinctively needing. Needing what? Spock, this child is about to wipe out every living thing on earth. Now what do you suggest we do? Spank it? It knows only that it needs, commander, but like so many of us, it does not know what. The carbon units know why the creator has not responded. Disclose the information. Not until v'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet! Captain! I'm losing starfleet! Interference from v'ger! Kirk-unit, disclose the information. Why has the creator not responded? No. Secure all stations. Clear the bridge. Clear the bridge, captain? That was the order, mr sulu. Clear the bridge! Aye, sir. Your child is having a tantrum, mr Spock. V'ger requires the information. Bridge! Secure all stations! Move out! Jim, what the hell kind of strategy is this? All ship's functions going to automatic, captain. If v'ger destroys the enterprise, the information that v'ger requires will also be destroyed! It is illogical to withhold required information. Kirk-unit! Kirk-unit. Why do you not disclose information? Because v'ger's going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet. - They have repressed the creator. - The information will not be disclosed! V'ger needs the information. Then v'ger must withdraw all the orbiting devices. V'ger will comply, if the carbon units will disclose the information. It learns fast, doesn't it? Captain, the vessel, v'ger, obviously operates from a central brain complex. The orbiting devices would be controlled from that point then? Precisely. The carbon unit's information cannot be disclosed to v'ger's probe, but only to v'ger directly. - Forward motion, captain. - Tractor beam. Captain, what's the next move? The question is, mr Decker, is there a next move? Resume duty stations. All personnel, resume stations! Well, mr Decker, it seems my bluff has been called. I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, captain. Mr Chekov, when do those devices reach final position? Twenty-seven minutes. Mark! Captain, I believe that is our destination. Forward motion, slowing, captain. I read an oxygen-gravity envelope forming outside the enterprise. Forward motion, stopped, captain. V'ger. Sir, I've located the source of v'ger's radio signal. It's directly ahead. That transmitter is a vital link between v'ger and its creator. The carbon units will now provide v'ger with the required information. Mr Spock? Bones? Mr Decker, I will contact you every five minutes. Captain, I'd like to go along. Mr sulu, you have the conn. V'ger. V-g-e-r. V'ger. V-o-y-a-g-e-r. Voyager! Voyager vl! NASA. National aeronautics and space administration. Jim, this was launched more than 300 years ago. Voyager series, designed to collect data and transmit it back to earth. Captain, voyager vl disappeared into what they used to call a black hole. It must have emerged on the far side of the galaxy and fell into the machine planet's gravitational field. The machine inhabitants found it to be one of their own kind. Primitive, yet kindred. They discovered its simple 20th-century programming. "Collect all data possible." "Learn all that is learnable." - Return that information to its creator. - Precisely, mr Decker. The machines interpreted it literally. They built this entire vessel so that voyagercould actually fulfil its programming. And on its journey back, it amassed so much knowledge, it achieved consciousness itself. It became a living thing. Kirk-unit. V'ger awaits the information. Enterprise, order up the ship's computer library of records on the late 20th century NASA probe, voyager vl. Specifically, we want the old NASA code signal that instructs the probe to transmit its data. - And fast, uhura, fast! - Aye, sir. That's what it's been signalling! Its readiness to transmit its information! And there's no one on earth who could recognise the old signal and send a response. "The creator does not answer." V'ger. V'ger! We are the creator. That is not logical. Carbon units are not true life forms. We will prove it. We will make it possible for you to complete your programming. Only the creator could accomplish that. Enterprise. We have just received the response code, captain. Set the enterprise transmitter on appropriate frequency and transmit the code now! Transmitting. 5-0-4, 3-2-9, 3-1 -7, 5-1 -0, and the final sequence... That should trigger voyager's transmitter. Voyager is not transmitting its data, captain. The creator must join with v'ger. Uhura! Repeat the final sequence. The creator must join with v'ger. Voyager is not transmitting, captain, because it did not receive the final sequence. Jim! We're down to 10 minutes. Enterprise, stand by. - The antenna leads are melted away. - Yes, captain, just now. - By v'ger itself. - Why? To prevent reception. Of course, to bring the creator here to finish transmitting the code in person. To touch the creator. Capture god? V'ger's liable to be in for one hell of a disappointment. Perhaps not, doctor. Captain. V'ger must evolve. Its knowledge has reached the limits of this universe and it must evolve. What it requires of its god, doctor, is the answer to its question, "ls there nothing more?" What more is there than the universe, Spock? Other dimensions, higher levels of being. The existence of which cannot be proven logically. Therefore, v'ger is incapable of believing in them. What v'ger needs in order to evolve is a human quality, our capacity to leap beyond logic. And joining with its creator might accomplish that. You mean, this machine wants to physically join with a human? Is that possible? Let's find out. - Decker! - I'm going to key the final sequence through the ground test computer. Decker, you don't know what that'll do to you! Yes, I do, doctor! Decker, don't! Jim, I want this. As much as you wanted the enterprise, I want this. Captain. Spock, did we just see the beginning of a new life form? Yes, captain. We witnessed a birth. - Possibly, a next step in our evolution. - I wonder. Well, it's been a long time since I delivered a baby, and I hope we got this one off to a good start. I hope so, too. I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose out of our own human weaknesses and the drive that compels us to overcome. And a lot of foolish human emotions, right, mr Spock? Quite true, doctor. Unfortunately, it will have to deal with them as well. Interrogative from starfleet. They're requesting damage and injury reports and complete vessel status. Report two casualties. Lieutenant llia. Captain Decker. - Aye, sir. - Correction. They're not casualties. They are... List them as missing. - Vessel status, fully operational. - Aye, sir. Mr Scott! Shall we give the enterprise a proper shakedown? I would say it's time for that, sir. Aye. We can have you back on vulcan in four days, mr Spock. Unnecessary, mr Scott. My task on vulcan is completed. - Mr sulu, ahead warp 1. - Warp 1, sir. Heading, sir? Out there. Thataway. Highcode release @ areafiles. Org
