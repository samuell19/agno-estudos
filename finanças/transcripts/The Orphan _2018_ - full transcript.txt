- Is yours the yellow team? - Yeah. Yours is black. Get out. Get out. Hey, Vanessa, come here next to me, bitch. No, it’s your turn, asshole. Shut up! Wait, wait, wait. No way. 6 to 1. Jonathas, Ms. Leila is calling you. Go! Go! Go! Bye, Jonathas. The Orphan Sit down. Jonathas, you know Raul and Paula? That have been coming here all month to get to know you better. I have good news for you. No... This time it’ll work out, if it didn’t work out before, it's because it wasn’t meant to be. Look at me... Jonathas, what did you do to your hair? Now of all times? Better to do it here now, than do it there and mess up the woman's whole bathroom. Excuse me... Hey, let's go see your room? - Okay. - Let’s go? I wanted to ask a question. No, never mind. Forget it. -What? -Forget it, really. No, go ahead. You can ask, you can ask whatever you want. No... What do you want to know? Which one of you can’t have kids? We can have kids, it’s just that Carlos always wanted to adopt. Yeah, we wanted to adopt. Why would you ask something like that? Because I’ve already seen a lot of cases like this. Did Ms. Leila say something? No, no. Well, I was just asking. Sorry if I did something wrong. -No. -No. You're off work tomorrow, right? You guys could go play some soccer. Yes... - There’s a field close by here, right? - Yeah. It’s nice there. I don’t know how to play soccer. You don’t? No. No? - You don’t know how to play soccer? - No. You never thought of being a soccer player? The most I know is how to cheer, and I don’t even know if I do that right. Like, "ever". There’s ice cream... vanilla. I prefer to stay here with you than stay in that awful house. - 3/22/1997. - Jonathas, let me show you something. What? Vanessa and Jonathas... Aw, sweetheart! I love you, you know? - So we can’t go in your room? - No... - We can't? - Because bedrooms are private, right? - Yes... But we aren’t... we are close, aren't we? We are. So... You’re going to be adopted one more time. Are you happy? What did Ms. Leila tell you? That they’re rich, that they have a pool. And Raul, what I thought was interesting about Raul is that he’s Donald Trump’s third cousin, they have this connection... second cousin, third cousin, I don’t know. He’s like mixed, from the United States and from Texas. But she didn’t say anything about your hair? She did! She said my hair looks awful. Well, she got that much right. - Jeez, girl, you’re the one who helped me do it! - Oh, Jonathas, just between us, you look like a caterpillar! Picture my face. The ass face I was. I think I’ll spend about 5 weeks there. Any more than a month and I’ll break my record. But then I’ll come back full force! I’ll take this place down. Gosh. Got it? I’ll take this place down, messing with everyone. But there’s something in your bag you’re gonna like. Go on, I’m all ears. I’m not gonna tell you. You guess. Some of your make up? Yeah... The one I want?! No. - Oh...lipstick? Mascara? Eyeliner? - Yes. What? Yes, lipstick. Velvet? - No! - Velvet is a color. I know, but it’s not that. It’s red, right? Oh, you already know? Did you peek? You always give me red. I'll stay right here, I already stole the spot. Shut up, you faggot! Queer! Jonathas... Faggot... come take on this faggot over here, asshole! Jo... Yes, dad. There’s something we need to tell you. That I’m adopted? Jonathas, now’s not the time for jokes. Me and Carlos... we’re separating, couple issues. Things that happen. We thought that, I don’t know, if we brought you here, it would... But... which one of you am I going to stay with? Wait. That story of Daniela and Carlos... about separation, was not true, was it? Jonathas, did you hear what I said? When it’s not meant to be, it’s not meant to be, and that’s it. Forget all that, Jonathas. Forget it. Jonathas. Listen to me. Jonathas! It's different this time... Paula and Raul are here... And don’t do anything else to your hair, you hear me?
