There's a lot of paperwork during a war. They need people who can type. And I can sure type. William Henry Longley, I'm gonna paddle your little back porch! Give me that sugar bowl! Oh! Hey, don't tickle me! No, please, don't! Oh! Could I help you? Uh, excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry to be botherin' you this time of night. I need a telephone. Well, it's awfully late. We're closed. I know, ma'am. I'm broke down out on the highway. I need to call somebody to come and git me. Well, all right. Just give me a minute, though, and the phone is, uh, in here on the wall. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Number, please. Number, please! Hello? I don't have a number. Well, then, uh. what's the name, please? I'll have to look it up. Nita Longley. I told you I'd think up some business with you one of these days. Didn't I? I'm gonna have to call the sheriff. Oh, no! Please. I've got two little boys. I'll tell you what, ma'am. You don't give us no trouble, and we won't give them boys none. Please don't do this. Please! Make 'em bounce. - Make 'em bounce! - No! Mama? Mama! Calvin? Shh. Who was it? Sailor? Go see. Go on!
