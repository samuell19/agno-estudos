When their relationships fail, women often have a hard time coping with it. How can I blame her? I've known liang since we were young. She fears losing the most. Yet she loses the most. Her father died early, and her mother remarried. When she herself got married, her fear grew. She's afraid of pesticides, pollution, radioactive clouds, and murders. She is afraid. She is afraid of losing the things she loves. Husband, children and her home. Now it's all good. It still hurts a little. You will get used to it. If your teeth gets crooked even further, it will be a big trouble! Your turn, yuan yuan! Here. No. Be good. No! No! Come to the doctor. No. - Come over. I don't wan to! Don't be afraid. It will just take a while. No. Yuan yuan. Here. The new tooth is coming out. No. We can pull it out. Or it will be crooked like your father's teeth. Yuan yuan. You will be like the iron jaw. We can wait. Here. It's shaking. It will fall out naturally. Be good! It will be quick. It won't hurt at all. We can wait. We can wait! Whatever. Ok. No more teeth pulling today. She should have it pulled. What if her teeth are crooked? It's uggly. It will fall naturally. My friend died because of a dental accident. Her heart stopped they said, it was because of the narcotics. It's impossible. You are over worrying. Quick. Yuan yuan. Chiao chiao. Don't touch it. It's dirty. Let's get some drinks. They can just eat fruits. Stop worrying. There're preservatives and coloring on food we eat how can we avoid? Right. Why aren't you at school? Today is Sunday. I forgot. Why didn't your mom take you out? My mom said there's no place in Taipei. There are people everywhere. I just went to the dentist with my dad. He's an iron jaw now. I just cleaned the bathroom. It's so pretty. Is it for americaÂ®? We are going home! Let me. Let me. Ok. Quiet. Remember to take the grocery. Ok. Say goodbye now. Bye! Here. We are going. We're leaving. Bye, dad. I want the juice dad bought for us. I'll give you an apple. No. Then you can eat nothing. Don't open the door. Be careful. Hello? Does liang live here? I am. Who is this? This is an ping! So pretty. Are these all antiques? My husband likes to design things. He left an ad agency for this. Nowadays, rich people like this kind of stuff. Business was better two years ago. I am not an expert. I just clean. Please sit. Auntie. Thanks. Say hello. Auntie. How old are you? Five. How old are you? Six and a half. Six and a half! I am going to elementary school soon. You're tall. You are almost taller than my son! He is in third grade now. So big. Go play. How is your mom? Same old. How's yours? We still live at the old house. You heard that I divorced, right? I moved back with my mother. It's been years. I work at a restaurant now. Manager? It's nothing. How did you find me? It's easy. We grew up together. I am going to be straight forward. Go ahead. Do you remember my sisters? An ling and an jyue? The youngest married. An ling, she was just in middle school when you moved. We were in high school, then you got in college. I studied tourism. I'm working in the same industry. What about an ling? She's always liked to dance. My dad sent her to learn dancing in university, but learning is one thing working is another. She had not make any achievements, after she graduated. She's teaching in a studio opened by her classmate. Her classmate came from a rich familiy. It's near here. That's great. It's not that great. She... I don't know... She somehow met your husband. You are just the same. Your hand shakes when you are nervous. I just knew. Liang, you have to trust me. Although I came here for an ling. She wants a resolution. But I have been in your shoes. I know that a woman can never fall in love with someone else's husband. That's not just destroying one person. It's destorying a whole family. I think you should talk to your husband. And try to solve things. This is better for an ling. She is 27. She doesn't have a career, and her personal life is a mess. This is no good. I am thinking for everyone. Our teacher says the worst things. She says our heads are filled with poop. Can heads be filled with poop? It's so dirty. Tell your teacher, if she keeps talking like this, I will go talk to her. Why? Go to your room and practice piano. Go. Go to mom's room watch TV. Why can't I watch TV? Go! What are you doing? Why are you in such a bad mood? Why did you lie to me? About what? You are my dearest person, but you lied. Who's been here? An ling's sister. She was in the shop. And bought a jewelry box. Then... I met her at a restaurant again. We talked. I want a divorce. An ping. An ping. Who is it? Mrs. fan. I am liang. Who are you looking for? I am liang! Come in! Come and sit. Is an ping here? She's taking a nap. I will get her. How is your mom? I haven't seen her in a while. She's fine. That's good. Is her... Is her husband nice to her? He's fine. When your father died, we didn't help much. Everyone was poor at that time. Is an ling not here? She's in class. She's a dance teacher. I will get an ping. An ping. An ping. Liang is here. Come up here. Are you staying for lunch? No. I am busy this afternoon. Really? It's messy here. Sit down. They built a new house there. You can't see your apartment anymore. Do you remember our neighbor mao? He's in jail now. Why? He used to hide a knife in his pants. Now he robs people with a gun. Anything can happen these days. I didn't have time to tidy up. I came back late yesterday. You work late? No. I was talking to my friends. I want to start selling clothes. There are no prospects in the restaurant business. You are here for an ling? I want to figure things out. I've seen your husband from far away. He looks like he's never seen hard times. You know my sister. She's ambitious. She wants to be a dancer. They probably... Have lots in common. More than you do. My son. Isn't he handsome? I bought a small apartment. I paid the deposit already. I spent all my savings on it. But it feels good to have your own place. Listen to me. Betrayals are hard to tolerate. But they don't really want to get divorced. I know you. You can't let go, but you can't leave him. So you have to be careful. I don't want you to get hurt. I won't hurt you. Hands! Five, six, seven, eight! Move your head. Have my sister told you everything? What do you want? I want him. What kind of a woman, wants to destroy other people's family? Don't you think it's immoral? No. Maybe I am guilty legally. But emotionally, I love him. I just do. I don't think it's a crime to love. Marriage is a system. It doesn't necessarily make sense. You wouldn't understand. Because you never understand him. I know you've been close to my sister. I wish it weren't you. I admit I started it. This is my own doing. But there's no turning back. He's my only serious boyfriend. You are alone? My tooth fell during snack time. Why are we going home already? I am taking you to grandma's. What about dad? He will be at the shop. I don't like grandma's house. It's so small. Me either. Nonsense. Why are you here? Why didn't you call? I have to leave right now. Please let yuan yuan and chiao chiao live here. I am going to kaosiung. Why are you going to kaosiung? I have business there. I want to eat grapes. Peel the skin first. They are clean. I washed them. You can't wash off the pesticides. There's no use to peel them. Stop worrying. Worry. What's the use of worrying? I want grapes. Don't cry. You ate everything when you were young. You are not poisoned. Be good to grandma. This is not as comfy as your house. I have a small house. Say bye to mom. Don't wash their clothes with laundry powder. I never got cancer from laundry powder. You always said so. What's wrong with being careful? Pick them up soon. Your father will be unhappy if they get loud. My dad died. Your stepfather is your father, too! What about the kids? None of your business. What do you mean? I want a divorce. Liang. Our problem cannot be solved by a divorce. She told me you talked to her. Did she tell you, or did she come to you? You have no shame. Don't touch me. I know I can't explain this. I can only say, that sometimes people have desires they can't control. You have desires. So I don't? I stay at home all day and care for the kids. You think I don't have desires? Liang. Things can be solved. How? I don't want to share my husband. I don't like broken things. You... One of you has desires, the other is lonely. And you say it's not immoral. You... You make me feel... Disgusted. Hello. Welcome, did you make a reservation? No. Can we see your ID please? Thank you. There's water in the pot. You can call the lobby for room service. Ok. Thanks. Sir. Can you give me a new pair? Sorry. We only have these. It's noisy. We already tried our best. The restaurant downstairs. They closed at ten. I mean the fire... There are lots of people around. Why are you afraid? The deposit is 20,000 dollars. The rent is 5,000 dollars. You can move in anytime. Can I not pay the deposit? The landlord demands it. I can't help. You told me you were going to kaohisung. Where are yuan yuan and chiao chiao? Their dad picked them up last night. They're my kids! Why did you let him take them? I am looking for a place. You didn't tell me. Their dad told me he wanted them. I couldn't say no. You told me you were going south. Last night when your husband came, I knew something's wrong. Husbands and wives fight all the time. I'll call him to pick you up. Is there someone else? I am calling your in laws. Stay out of this. I am your mother. You never tell me anything. You never help me. You can only cry, and ask my parents in law to come. I know you hate me for remarrying. But your dad died. Weren't for your stepfather, how could you finish school? Don't you forget I worked, too. I slept here! Right here on the floor! Is this my home? Stay out of this. I will take care of it. I am your mother. How can I stay away? What could you do? I want to divorce, but I can't rent a place. Can my kids fit into this house? Or can you lend me money? Liang. Don't do something rash. Your husband has a good business. You have no money. We invested all the money to the store. Except for grocery money. What I have... You know, he ever questions where I spend the money you give me. I don't have any. Your hair looks weird. Next time call me beforehand. I have a lunch box. We won't be eating together. You won't blame me? Tonight... I have to pick my son up. You don't know how lucky you are. You can just be a wife, but you want a job! You are too old. It's hard to find a job these days. The pay is too little. The high paid jobs want experienced people. Don't be silly. You can do nothing and take care of kids. It's lucky! I have a meeting. I can't talk to you anymore. By the way, I've been thinking of sending my son to study in America. Doesn't your husband have some connections? Ok. Don't forget. Ok. Bye. How many? How many people, miss? One. This way. There's a guest looking for you. Ok. What happened to your hair? I am leaving. Come on Sunday. I will tell our son. Ok. My ex-husband. We parted on bad terms. Now he wants to be with the kid all the time. He still loves you? So what? I don't want to waste my life on him again. Unless I meet a man who treats me fairly. I moved out. An ling and I had a huge fight. She said I sold her out. Now she lives in the dance studio. She doesn't want to see me. I realize... I don't have friends. I don't even have a place to go to. Do you believe it? Soâ? That's normal. Relationships are hard to keep. It's not easy to be friends. Eat something. Go for a walk. Try to forget about things. Get up. You want a slut? I will be one. It was not like you. That's how you like it. I came back... Because I couldn't stay outside. I know. You don't know. You don't know anything. I thought I could leave. But I got used to this. I can't leave this house. Without money and jobs, I don't even... Have... A home I can go back to. The worst part is, I only have you. I know. I am worried. It's good that you are home. Did he promise to stop messing around? That's good. That's good. I always thought you are building a great family. Who knew? I am going back. My husband... Would get mad. Get a taxi. It's too hot. Buses are fine. Hello? It's me. Are you there? I am. That's fine. You won't lie to me again, will you? Things has passed, we can all talk now. Things hasn't passed. I want to tell you I beg you, to let us go. I do love him. He also loves me. You know that. Even if you don't understand, why don't you think for us? Let us be together. You call me immoral. But aren't you cruel? I beg you. They are married. You are my sister, but you are helping other people. I am helping you. Stop this before it's too late. Whatever. You are unhappy. So you don't want people to be in love. If your husband comes now, would you really not sleep with him? You... I am saying it again. He doens't leave you because he feels bad for you. He wants his kid. You can keep him, but not his heart. Unless I die. Never mind her. You will get through this. If you can't, it's your fault. I am so hungry. Why isn't dad back? Auntie! Auntie! There was a phone call, and the boss went out. I didn't want to say this, but that woman called, and said she's killing herself. He.. He.. Wait, mom. Why are we here? To find dad. Boom! You are a pig now. Why did you hit me? Ok. You can be mom. You can be a frog. I want to be a space warrior. Grandma grandma! Have you eaten? We ate fried chicken. Doesn't your mom think it is bad for health? You are coughing. Didn't you take him to doctors? There's no need for a doctor. It's just the Taipei air. What's wrong? What? As long as you are fine. Have you had a fight? Let me run you a bath. Let's go. You just came. Why are you here? To see you. There's nothing to see. You just gave me some. Keep it. I don't need it. Talk to him. Stop fighting. Stop talking about a divorce. Bye! Where are we going? Where can we go? Dad. Are you sleeping? What were you doing with that lady? Liang. What? There are no other possiblities, right? What do you mean? It's unfair to you. You love her? A lot? Why? She's already part of my life. You know I am a decent man. What? Stop pushing her. I am pushing her. If we were to divorce, can you really be on your own? My own? The kids better stay home. It's better for them. Mom. Would you divorce dad? Why? Dad has a girlfriend now. On TV, the kids have to choose who they want to be with. We won't divorce. Would dad leave us? No. Why not? Because dad loves mom. He loves you guys, too. I love you too. Mom, I love you. I love you, too. Do you want some apple juice? Yes. Tidy up. I will pour you some. I want some. Bring it to dad first. Take them to your room. Hm. I am like these things. What? I am not the best, but the one you can afford. Who is the best? You have been searching all your life. This is desire, isn't it? Do you permit me to have desire? No. No. You used to love only me. You fell in love with me the first day in the office, right? Right. You told me I have the prettiest legs then. You've always liked pretty things. You know there's more. Otherwise, there will be no pain. I never understood you, have I? It's nothing. Who wants to admit that this is all they will accomplish? Open a store, and earn some money. That's it. What else do you want? The question is, what else can I do? Let's leave here. We can go to America. It's no use, right? We're torturing each other. I know. I know. But I don't know what to do. I hate you, and I want to leave you. But I want you, too. I don't know what to do! I really don't. I am useless. Useless. I am so tired. Sleep a little.
