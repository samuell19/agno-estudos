I dream of Christmas Snow flakes in the air I dream of Christmas Here we go. I am so glad you've joined me for my favorite time of year... the Christmas holiday. If you've been following me you know I've got great hacks for holiday design but today I wanna talk about embracing the heart of the season. The personal touch makes all the difference and Christmas is the time to fill your space with family traditions. Felt stockings from second grade... check. Homemade cranberry popcorn strings... perfect. And of course... the smell of Christmas cookies. Today I am baking our family favorite... candy cane cookies. And last... the Christmas tree. My dad set ours up the day after Thanksgiving. Though if it was up to him he would've started around Labour Day because... Oh... wow... My regular followers know I lost my dad six months ago, but he is... such a part of what Christmas means to me. Every year, uh, we would put together a train under the tree. Now, it wasn't fancy. It ran off the tracks half the time, but it is everything I'm talking about. Personal and filled with memories. Now you know what to do. I'm Hayley Brandt signing off with a few holiday tips and some unexpected emotions. Wow. Mrs. Peterson's designer showcase house, Lolly Peterson speaking. Mrs. Peterson, hi. It's Hayley Brandt. Oh, wonderful. I've had a designer fall out of this year's showcase. How busy are you? Say you're not busy at all. I'm sorry, are you asking me... To take over one of the rooms. It's an impossible timeline, our doors open on New Year's day, but it's fantastic exposure... and it's for a good cause. Say yes. Yes. Yes. How did you find me? Well, everyone else is on vacation or booked. And then someone showed me your... what's it? Uh... live thing. Vendors are in short supply so you will need to find resources. Still a yes? I will be there in half an hour. Oh! Merry Christmas to me. The showcase house is incredible. You know how it works, each designer gets assigned a room to decorate in their own distinct style and then people buy tickets to see the house and the proceeds go to charity. Sarah, I got the study. It's huge! But the other designers are all really well-known, it's gonna be hard to stand out. No, you're gonna nail it like you nail every other gig. I hope so. Anyway... still on for later? Uh... yeah. I'm just dropping off food to my mom. I can't wait to see what your mom's house looks like this year. Me too. Hi Mom. Oh... I didn't realize how late it got. I'm sorry, I had to stop by this work thing. Hi sweetheart. Uh, have you been home all day? I took the car to fix that headlight. I thought you were gonna get out some Christmas decorations and get started inside. I thought so too. Well, I brought you some dinner. And candy cane cookies, your favorite. It sounds like quite an opportunity. It's launched all sorts of big names. It could really push me to a whole new level. Your dad... would be so proud. Let's do the tree. Maybe even get a few garland up. You're so supportive. I just can't find it in me yet. Well, we have to try, right? For Dad. Yeah. Shoot. Hmm... who's Gordon? Got some more good stuff. Where'd you find that? It was under some storage shelves. Was it yours? I thought we lost that in the last move. That's you in the picture. It says Gordon on the back. Who's Gordon? He's my brother. You have... your... I knew that you were adopted, but... He was older than me by seven years. He looked out for me the whole time we were in the group home together. He aged out when I was 11. And then what happened? He had a hard time finding his way. He'd come back and see me at first. But he got into some trouble and eventually he just... never came back. When's the last time you saw him? A few months before your Grandma and Grandpa adopted me. He would've been 19. And no contact since, at all? We could find him. It's so much easier to find people now. We could start with a name search and if he has a business... Hayley, stop. Too much time has passed. I made my peace with it long ago. Let it go. Okay. I can't believe you still do handwritten notes in all your Christmas cards. Well, you know what I always say... The personal touch... is everything. Listen, with the showcase... You're gonna be busier than ever. Yes, but I don't wanna leave you alone. Especially during the holidays. I'll find my way. I understand you need time, Mom. But... can you try to just get out a little everyday for me? I'll try. Just for my girl. How about a cookie? Yes. Just for you. She has a brother? So I have an uncle all this time. How's that possible? I don't know. How does someone never mention they have a brother? His name is Gordon Renton and I have an idea. I mean, how many Gordon Renton's could there be? Uh... think for a second. If you take this step you can't go back. She reads all day in my dad's sofa and has barely decorated for the holidays. Maybe finding her long lost brother is what she needs to get moving again. Or maybe this Gordon guy stayed away for a reason. Maybe he's a bad person. Okay... or they lost each other too soon and he's dying to find her. If I could bring them together over Christmas wouldn't that be the most amazing present? Let me... let the expert go to work. Uh... what was the name of your mom's group home again and where was it located? Right. It was, um... Braithwaite and it was here in Denver. And the nearest high school to Braithwaite is... - East Barrington High. - Okay. Six names on one page? Hayle? You okay? Yeah, it's just... Well, it's been me and my dad and Mom for so long. Now I could have more family. There are phone numbers. - Here. - Yeah? Yeah. Oh boy. Okay, this is happening. This is really happening. Alright. Here we go. Hi. I'm calling from the East Barrington High reunion committee. Is this the same Gordon Renton who graduated in '78? Oh. Sorry. Thanks for your time. Okay. Next one. Hi. May I please speak to Gordon Renton? Oh... I'm so sorry for your loss. Scary how easy this is for you. Three are in Maine, Seattle and... Germany. Only one other with a Colorado area code, a business called Timber Grove Cabins. Wanna try? Oh. Uh... It's ringing. Timber Grove Cabins, Gordon speaking. Uh, hi. Is this, uh, Gordon Renton? Who's calling please? Mr. Renton I'm calling on behalf of East Barrington High School reunion committee. Uh, next year is your... I'm sorry ma'am but I got my GED. Good luck to you though. - He got a GED. - Oh. You know, but... he didn't deny going to East Barrington High. He just said that he didn't graduate from there, right? I mean, come on, look. Do you think they look the same? Uh... that picture's from 50 years ago. Okay. Well his business says that it's in a town called Silver Valley. Isn't Silver Valley right near Aspen? I think so. It's, like, four hours away. I mean, I could take a day trip there and meet him in person. There are three other Gordons. Yeah, like in... Germany or wherever. This one is in Colorado where my mom grew up and maybe where he grew up. And this is something you have to ask in person, right? What are you gonna tell your mom? Nothing, until I know more. Won't she wonder why you're taking a road trip? I'll say that I'm sourcing items for my showcase house, right? I have to do that anyway. Look... if it's not him, I come back, no harm done. But if it is him... maybe I come back with her long lost brother. Okay. I think I can do this. Oh, no. I... I can't do this. I can't do this. Okay. I'm doing this. I'm going to do this. - Hi. - Hi. Hello. Uh... are you... you're not Gordon Renton. No, I'm not. You must be from out of town. I... I am. And of course you're not him, Gordon would be much older. So, um... I'm so sorry, can you... can you just give me one sec? Uh, yep. Yep. Hello? One sec. Of course. Yeah. I'll be there, yes. Yeah. We'll be open. Okay. Great. Oh no! I am... Okay, bye. I am so sorry. I am not usually this clumsy. I mean, I am. But usually people get to know me first and then it's okay. It's fine. And just so you know, the cabins we actually build are much more sturdy than this. Um... so, is Mr. Renton here? You just missed him. He left right before you came in. He's heading up to the model cabin. Can I help you with anything? Are you... interested in building a cabin? No. I'm... looking to rent a cabin. - Oh. - Yeah. Uh... next spring actually. A large cabin for a week. Do you wanna head up to the model cabin? You can look around. Oh... Gordon will be up there. Yes! Gordon... perfect. At the... at the cabin, that would be... that'd be great. - Great. - Yeah. Follow me. The road up can get pretty icy, I'll take you in my truck. Oh. Okay, great. - Okay. - Thanks. Yeah, we just finished decorating for our annual Christmas fundraiser. Gordon started it years ago. It just keeps getting bigger. Sorry, I'm an interior decorator, I couldn't help but notice this table. Where did you get it? Oh, my friend Brianna designed it. She's got a workshop in town. I could see if I've got a card if you want. That'd be great. Yeah. Let me see. My late wife carved that. Incredible. Yeah. Here we are. Brianna at Meadowlark Designs. - Hey. - Nice. Thank you. I have it on good authority she's the best furniture maker in Colorado. Gordon, this is Hayley. Hayley is an interior decorator from... Sorry, I didn't ask where you're from. Oh, Denver. City girl. I spent some time there. She's interested in renting a cabin. Nice. Uh, yes. For a reunion in the spring. What better place than Silver Valley? You've spent time here? Uh... well, not since I was little. Well, you drove a long ways. Why don't we go get lunch and I can tell you more about the area? Yeah, that would be great. Gordon, any chance you're free to join? I'd love to hear more about Timber Grove Cabins. I could eat. Great! Alright. How long have you had the company? Forty years this May. Wow! And you... you grew up here? Sorry. I... I ask a lot of questions. I started my own business two years ago and I love hearing how other people got started. I built my family in Silver Valley. First place that felt like home. How about you? Is it a big family reunion? Uh, the... the reunion is of, um... neighborhood friends. Yeah, we were all really, really close. So, Gordon... Oh, what are you flagging down reindeer from the sky in that thing? We have an ugly sweater contest at the festival committee meeting later. I... am winning. You're definitely a shoe in. Brianna, this is Hayley... Hayley, Brianna. Hayley is an interior decorator from Denver and... Hayley Brandt? I... watch your livestreams. You're kidding? Well I am crazy about your table. Like I said, best furniture maker in Colorado. Dad... stop. Are you okay? Yeah... yeah. I'm good. Well, it was so nice to meet you. I will definitely stop by. Sounds great. I gotta grab a pie for that meeting. - See ya later. - Bye! See ya. So, um... how old were you when you left Denver? Sorry. Um... I forgot to ask Brianna about that hutch she's making for the Harrison cabin. Personal touches are everything. You guys have a good day. He's a very private guy so don't be offended. Yeah. Hey, listen, I can definitely help you find a nice, big cabin for your neighborhood reunion. Oh, also there is a Christmas festival tonight. The whole town turns up. You should stick around. It might be a good way to get a feel for the place. Well, I do need more time. Can you suggest a good B&B? Yeah. Yeah? Looks like I'm staying the night. So now you have an uncle, a cousin and a potential dating opportunity? That's pretty fast work for one day. Okay, can we get back to Gordon please? Tell me you did more research. The GED... there was a Gordon Renton with a GED transcript and it was the right year but... it was in Kansas. There was an army vet sticker on the back of his truck. There are two army bases in Kansas. Sarah, there are these small things that he did that are just like my mom. You know how she folds her towels? He did it too. What if it really is him? Could be. Oh! Patricia? Ellen... hi. Oh, we haven't seen you in... Oh, honey, I was so sorry to hear about Henry. What a terrible loss. He was such a lovely man. Are you holiday shopping? I've got a few new novels I could recommend. Actually I was looking for a Christmas card. I remembered you have the most beautiful selection. Just one special card? Oh, here. How about this? It's perfect. Hayley! You made it. Jake, hey. You were right, everyone really does turn out for this. - It's a pretty tight community. - Yeah. You'll see in the spring at the arts festival as well... for your reunion. Uh... yes, right. Spring reunion, yes. Whoo! Are you cold? Yeah. It's, uh... it's a lot colder than I thought it would be. And I didn't actually pack for an overnight, so... Kind of a spur of the moment gal, aren't ya? Yeah. Alright. Why don't we get you a hat? - Oh... great. - Okay. What the heck is that? You've never seen cookies on a stick before? Tell me you buy cookies on a stick. What kind of Christmases did you have? The best, actually. My dad dressed up like Santa one year. He rented a sleigh and delivered presents around the neighborhood. My friends referred to him as Santa Henry from then on. What's he gonna do to top it off this year? Oh... wow. It is actually freezing. Okay. Come with me. Yeah. I love hats. I love these hats. I don't know how to choose. How about this one? Oh... Always a fashionable holiday choice. Perfect, but only if you go for this one. O-kay. Oh, cute. So cute. Oh, somehow not quite you. It's not me? No. Maybe more of an elf look. Ooh, I'm not really much of an elf guy. - No? - But I think you could be. Oh, I could pull it off. Let's see. Oh, it's fun. It's maybe a bit over the top. - It's not over the top at all. - No? It's actually perfect. Could we get the two hats, please. Oh... there it is. Right there. Oh wait! No. I... I've got this, I'm the cold one. No. I'm the one that asked you to stick around, so. Do you know what we should do? We should get some hot chocolate. - Absolutely. - Yeah. - Yes, but only if it is on me. - Okay. Hey. Isn't that Brianna? Yeah. Let's go say hi. Okay. Hey! Hey. You stuck around. Just got her a new hat, she was a little cold. I would've got you one but they didn't have one ugly enough for that sweater. Hmm, you mean my award-winning sweater? You won? What'd you get? - A really ugly trophy of course. - Of course. You made all this? This is amazing. I'm a one-woman outfit. Wow. You must be crazy busy. The Christmas stuff goes fast. It's the rest of the year I'm trying to bulk up. I keep telling her it's only a matter of time. You two are cute together. Thanks. I... Wait, what? What? Are you two not together? - No. - Oh? No, no, no. Are you kidding? We've known each other since forever. - He's like my... brother. - Sister, yeah. He's all yours... if you want him. Oh, no... I'm not... Of course, you must have a boyfriend- Looking. Just like... Welcome. Welcome everyone to the Silver Valley Christmas festival! Yay! Have a jolly time and win toys to donate to the fireman's toy drive. Plenty of elves here to help gather the toys. Merry Christmas! Hey, why don't you go win some toys and I'll get us some hot chocolates? - Deal. - Great. Oh, try again. Oh, hey. Well, hello. You stayed. Yeah, well Jake mentioned this festival and I couldn't resist. I used to kill in this game. Really? Team up, win a toy together? You're on. Alright, let's go. - Ready? - Mmhmm. Yes! Fifty points, yes! Okay. Ready? Yeah, yeah. Yes! Two chances left. We got this. Okay, we got this. Yes! Alright. No pressure. Okay. Winner! Yes! Here is your prize. Oh! He reminds me of one I had as a kid. What about you? You must've gone to a lot of carnivals as a kid in what, Kansas did you say? I never, uh, never really made it to anything like this when I was a kid. Thanks for the game. - Hey, you won! - Hey. Yeah. Sorry that took so long. I had to jump in front of the line and bribe a couple of 10-year-olds. You okay? Yeah. You know what? I'm just gonna drop this toy off in the donation bin and head back to the B&B if that's okay. Yeah. Do you want a ride? I can give you a lift. Yeah, I'd like that. Alright. Dad, I got it. You're not supposed to lift heavy things. I know what my doctor said as well as you do. But in case you forgot, I run a construction company, I lift heavy things all day long. Well, maybe you should stop doing that. Ah, not this again. I'm fine now. I worry about you. I know you do, honey. But you shouldn't. Maybe it's time to start thinking seriously about retiring. You have Jake, you know? What would I do with myself all day long? I'd be bored to tears. You are the most stubborn man on the planet. I know... but you still love me. Your work looks amazing, by the way. Thanks Dad. Have you been in Silver Valley all your life? Mostly, yeah. Spent a little bit of time in Chicago. I hear it's a wonderful city. It wasn't for me. But I came back here and found my feet. Is that when you started working for Timber Grove? Actually Gordon kind of saved me. I know he seems tough on the outside but... once you get to know him and get past all that, he's... probably the most kind man I've ever met. He sounds incredible. Ah! Hey now, come on. Did he hurt you? Are you sure? - Wow. - Wow. So... are you gonna swing by tomorrow and finalize your reunion plans? I... Sorry, not that I was selling you on all this tonight or anything, like... this wasn't about that, I just... I'll definitely come by. Great. Hi sweetheart. How was today? Good! I went to the bookstore and saw Ellen there. Great. Did you buy out the whole store? Not the whole store. Mom, uh... I know it's a touchy subject, but... could I ask you more about Gordon? Sweetie, I just don't wanna talk about this. Yeah, I know. I know, but... you know, what could be so terrible about more family? Tell me how your day went. Um... actually... I met a fantastic furniture designer. You would love her. Terrific. You know, anyone you find will be lucky you did. I love you Mom. Love you more. Morning! Hey, you're up early. I just wanted to get the shop cleaned up in case Hayley comes by. She's not gonna care if your workshop is messy. Workshops are supposed to be messy. - You're such a guy. - You're such a girl. I just want it to look nice, that's all. You do think she'll stop by, right? Yes. Why are you so nervous? She's gonna love your work. I owe you a lot, you know. I know. Wait, why exactly? I never would've left Timber Grove to start my own business if you hadn't been there. I think you're underestimating your dad. He would've shoved you out the Timber Grove door if it meant making you happy. I'm concerned about him. Since Mom died he seems lonely and a little distant. I know. I'm trying to take more of the workload and I wanna talk to him about some of my new ideas. Jake... don't talk, just show him your cabin. Not ready yet. Ah... now who's nervous? Not me. Nope, not me. Right, okay. Bye. Hey there. You came! Welcome. Mind if I look around? Make yourself at home, please. Your stuff is beautiful. How long have you been at this? Forever. My mom was a sculptor. My dad gave me her tools and told me to go for it. My dad was the same. He passed six months ago. I'm so sorry. Was he an artist, or...? An attorney actually. But he'd totally say he was an artist. At Christmas he went all out. He's the one who encouraged me to start my business. Well, we come from the same family. Creative and encouraging. Um... you know what? I actually have a project coming up in the next few weeks. Something along the lines of this desk and chair would be perfect. It's a showcase house in Denver. Wait, are you talking about Mrs. Peterson's designer showcase house? Yeah! I'd love to be involved. And if these aren't exactly right I can do sketches. Would you? Because I've got assigned the study and it is all last minute. Of course. It's such a cool event. I could get you sketches by tomorrow. That fast? I'll run the sketches over to you in the morning. That is if you're staying in Silver Valley another night? Sounds like I have to. Okay. Why don't I meet you at the café at 9:00 tomorrow? We can have a cup of coffee before you go? Perfect. Thank you. Wow. Oh, and hey, if I'm staying another night, could you tell me where I could get some clothes? Yeah, absolutely. I will, um... I'll text you. Sounds good. - See ya. Bye. - Bye. Every year we would make a train to put under the tree together and it wasn't fancy. It ran off the track half the time, but it is everything I'm talking about. Okay. You're back. Did you need to make a return? No, no... I was thinking about your story hour. I remembered from teaching that not every kid can come with their own stuffed toy. I wanted to donate one. That is just like you. So thoughtful. We're just about to start. Do you wanna join us? I'll just listen here. Of course. You're welcome to listen any time. I'm telling you, if Brianna lived in Denver we would all be friends. A new bestie! The three musketeers. What if she is my cousin? What if this is the real Gordon? I want this so much for my mother. Just for your mother, huh? Oh, hey, can I call you back later? Hey! Hey! I was wondering when I'd see you. You get a chance to drive by those properties I emailed you? Oh, yeah, the whole morning got consumed. Right, working with Brianna. I... just, I was, you know, research on my, our... potential customer, so... Mmhmm. Are you coming in? - Yes. - Alright. Actually I dropped by to say thank you for walking me home last night. We had a little run in with a snowman last night. It all happened very fast. Yeah, it attacked without warning. Yeah, I had to fend it off with my bare hands. It was terrifying. Jake is a... is a hero. Oh... I'm glad the both of you survived. Hey, I noticed your truck outside had a vet sticker on it. Did you serve? Uh... my dad was in the army, he never stopped talking about the buddies he made in basic. Where did you do your training? Uh, Kansas. But that was a long time ago? Uh... cookie? Whoa, no! I am so sorry. You know what? I've got this, don't worry. Oh look! One that didn't break. Five second rule? Sorry. Doctor's orders. Oh. So, are you determined to just destroy this office or every office that you come in contact with? I, uh... I warned you. Plus, I did bring cookies. To make fun of me. To make you smile. Uh, so, uh... that stuff with Brianna... does that mean that you're staying til tomorrow? 'Cause there's a bunch of us we are gonna head up to the lake tonight and watch the meteor shower. I could pick you up if you wanted to come? Sure. Yeah, it sounds fun. I'll see you later then. Yeah. Thank you for these. Yeah. - Those little faces. - They just light up. Especially this time of year, so much magic. Do you miss teaching? I didn't when I retired. But Henry and I had such big plans. Now, I just feel kind of rudderless. You know, the store has a tradition leading up to Christmas Eve. We partner with a local shelter and read to children who don't have a traditional home over Christmas. For a long time, growing up, I didn't have a traditional home at Christmas. I lived in a children's home called Braithwaite. We need readers. You might be the perfect person for these kids. Closing papers on the Schollander cabin. We are scheduled to start right after Christmas. You did a good job in this last sale. Thank you. Fact is, bringing you into Timber Grove was one of the smartest things I ever did. Actually, you know, there are a few new ideas that I kinda wanted to run past you. Well, I'm pretty happy how we're doing things now. But I would like to talk to you about something. What's that? I'm... I'm not one to pry into your personal life, so you can just tell me it's none of business and I'll shut up. Okay. But I think you really like this Hayley girl. And if you do... I'd really hate to see you just let that go by. She lives in Denver, right? I learned the hard way that uprooting myself for someone else doesn't work out. I'm not convinced that's what's holding you back. I know you got hurt big time but at some point you've got to decide to try again. It's not that easy. Life isn't easy. Take that from someone who came up the hard way. And so... love isn't easy. But it's the one thing that makes life worth living. You invited her up to the lake tonight, right? I was being polite. She's your client. Come on. You were smiling at that gal like your jaw was gonna bust. How long are you gonna keep your heart shut up? Even if I was ready to open my heart... To her, I'm just a construction guy. Something wrong with that? Jake... she brought you cookies. In my day that was a date. Hmm. Maybe it's time to take a risk, huh? Hey, I can't talk long, I'm gonna check out a meteor shower with Jake. What? Wait a minute, now you're going stargazing with this guy? It's not like that. And besides... Besides what? Well, I mean, he is kinda fun. This is like pulling teeth. Who is this guy? What does he look like? Is he cute? Is he smart? Funny? Okay Sarah, we just met a day ago. But he is tall, dark and handsome. Always a good start. And he makes me laugh. Even better. Okay, but back to Gordon, because I do have news. Gordon was in the army in Kansas. Why didn't you just ask him then and there if he had a sister named Patricia? Because you were right. When I first came here I thought I was just doing this for my mom, but... now the stakes seem so much higher and I could see what it would be like to have more family. You really like these people, don't you? I really do. What if it turns out Gordon is not really your uncle? Yeah, I'm trying not to think about that right now. You need to ask him, Hayles. I know. Are you still open? I was just closing up but come in, come in. For your Christmas reading program for disadvantaged kids. Oh. I thought maybe you could use more books? This is so generous of you, Patricia. Let's put them in the hands of children who need them. They're not doing anyone any good stored in my garage. Shall we put them out so the kids can find them? Yes. Yes, let's do that. This is fantastic! Oh, my goodness. Look at this. Ha! I've always loved Christmas. How about this Christmas... how you doing? To be honest, it's been awful. So sorry, Patricia. Henry was my whole world and now I have to create a whole new world for myself. Any ideas on what that might be? I need to find a sense of purpose again. Your reading program feels like a baby step but in the right direction. So, I take it you'd like to be a reader? Yes, I would. Very much. So, meteor shower. Yeah. It's the last no moon night of the year which is when it's best to view them. There's a bunch every hour til, oh, 5:00 AM. I'm staying up til 5:00 AM? I'm game if you are. Silver Valley is definitely showing off. Is that why you're sticking around? Actually your pal Brianna's making it impossible to leave. She's gonna make my next project amazing. Alright. There you go. We're all ready. Should be any minute. We're ready! Yeah, I don't know. I don't see anything. It's all dark and... Oh... wow. Isn't that beautiful? I've never seen anything like it. Come here. What? You've got snowman cookie icing on your hat. Of course, I do. How is that possible? How did it get there? You really have to make a mess out of everything, don't you? Hey, so... do you wanna hang out tomorrow? After you get the drawings from Brianna, or... do you have to, like... head back? Yes. Yes, you have to head back or yes, you want to hang out. Yes, I... I would like to hang out tomorrow. Hey, so I think there's a hot cider stand around here somewhere, I could go get us a couple. - This one is on me. - No. - Yes! - No, no! Not a chance! - Stay here, I'll be back. - Alright. I hear we're a lot alike. Oh? You built your business from scratch and I built mine two years ago definitely from scratch. Please, have a seat. Can I ask what made you take the leap? Well, I guess I finally found something in this world I was good at. How about you? Oh, I went the traditional route. College design program, worked for a big designer and then I started my own business. Who's idea was that? My dad's. Nice. He's been gone now six months. I'm sorry. Just me and my mom now. My dad didn't have siblings. I always wanted more family. Did you ever feel like that? It's hard when the ones we think will always be there are taken from us. Families torn apart by circumstance. Did that happen to you? Yes. When I lost my wife, Brianna's mom. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. I guess we have that in common too. Surviving parent and only child. Were you an only child, Gordon? I didn't really have anyone. No brothers or sisters? No. Oh. That's too bad. Ah, I'm sorry. Um... I told Jake that I was gonna grab us some hot cider, so... Of course. It was good to see you. It was very nice to see you again. Hey! That took longer than... Oh! I'm sorry... - Are you okay? - I just couldn't. I just... Hey, did something happen? No, it's fine. I just... yes. The thing that I was hoping for just... The truth is... The reunion I was planning... Isn't real. You haven't looked at any properties and your stories have been a little vague on details. There was a reunion I was planning, I was hoping for but it's just... it's just not gonna happen. Okay. Can we just head back? Yeah. Yeah, let's go. I, uh... I misled you and I shouldn't have. I'm sorry. No. No harm done, really. You know what, I'm... I'm gonna grab Brianna's designs in the morning and then head straight home. I'll admit, I was looking forward to hanging out tomorrow. Yeah, I just... I just think it's better that I leave. Hayley... I like you. A lot. I like you. A lot. I just... it's complicated. Can I help? Is there... something I can do? Jake, you are such an amazing guy and I'm... I'm so lucky to meet you but I just, I can't do this right now. - I'm sorry. - Ok. Goodnight. Goodnight. Yeah. Hey. Jake said you made the decision to go a little abruptly. Oh... I'm... I'm sorry, I should've... I just wanted to say... the first Christmas is so hard. I remember feeling so lost. No matter how old you are, losing a parent makes you feel so small and alone. So if that's why you're going, I know what you're going through and you can call me any time. Do you mind? No, of course. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh, wow. These are even better than I imagined. Really? Yeah. Elevated and stylish. I can use this desk and chair as a centerpiece in my room. Get out. And the showcase posts the names of the artisans in every room. You are gonna get so much traffic from this. It's Mrs. Peterson. Mrs. Peterson, hi. I am actually here with a wonderful new furniture designer. Wh... What was that? Err... but I thought... Oh... What happened? The showcase got this big name designer to do a room but he would only do it if he could have the study. Wait. They... they fired you? No... they gave me the hallway. It's a... small mudroom at the back of the house. But, I guess, I only got the study in the first place 'cause there wasn't any more established names available. Hey... stop. It's not right, what she did. But you'll design the heck out of this space. Anybody can decorate a study. But when you make hay outta this, everyone will remember who you are. And Merry Christmas to all. Perfect. How come you're such a good helper? When I was your age I lived at a place called Braithwaite. I had a teacher who read Christmas stories to us. She helped us learn to write by writing Christmas cards. So when I grew up, I became a teacher so I could help kids learn how to read and write. I want to be a teacher too! I'm gonna get another book. What a gift you are to them. No, it's they who've given me the gift. I was so wrapped up in being sad. Well, of course you were. It's only natural. But Hayley was right, I needed to get out of the house. Being here with these children, it's given me back a sense of purpose. - Where do you want this? - Yeah, just right over here. Okay. Oh, I can't believe how great it is to work on a project with someone else. Running your own business is so... - Like being an only child. - Lonely. Yeah. Hey... I'm not the story. Yes, you are. And if you want people to know you, you have to... Wait, I have an idea. What are you doing? We are going live. - We are? - Uh-huh. Can you even do that from here? As long as Sarah's free to run it. I am a complete beginner. Oh, so was I. Jump in feet first. Sarah's in. Are you? I guess. Yeah! Here we go. Ready? Great. Live in three... two... Hey everyone, it's Hayley Brandt coming to you from Meadowlark Designs here in Silver Valley, Colorado. We're working together to design a room for Mrs. Peterson's designer showcase house, where you can support a great cause and see work from incredible designers like my new friend Brianna here. Now, you know what to do. Say bye to everyone. Merry Christmas! That was so much fun. Oh, and you are about to get really busy. Meadowlark Designs, this is Brianna. Who wants to go tree shopping? Yes, that does come in other colors. Hayley. Unfinished business? Uh, you could say that. Jake, I don't think I'm going tree shopping. Um... this is unbelievable. What am I gonna do? You're gonna stay here and keep answering that phone. And since your livestream is responsible... Oh, you saw that? Oh, I... You could make it up to me by going Christmas tree shopping in Brianna's place. Deal. - Go. - Okay. Wait a minute, you don't have a Christmas tree yet? Are you just doing the math on that now? It's just, it's December 7th. You seriously don't have a tree? No, I don't. Okay, well we are gonna fix that. Yes, we are. That's actually why we're here, so... What do you think of this? Ah, it's a little small. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. So, was construction always your thing? I had no clue that this was gonna be my future. I feel really lucky actually to have found Gordon and Timber Grove. Hmm... Yeah, before you said he saved you. Yeah, I was a bit of a wild kid, I guess. I felt like I never really fit in anywhere, so... So... Well... after college I got into a relationship and moved to Chicago and when the relationship blew up, my life kinda collapsed, so... I came home and joined Gordon's construction crew. He saw how hard I was working and... kinda took me under his wing. Well, he seems pretty great. He can be tough but it's because he sees something in you. Now you're his right-hand man. Yup. I mean, we do have our differences, you know. I wanna move the business forward with the stuff you're really good at. You know, creative promotions, social media, but Gordon doesn't see it. Well, it's just another way for people to get to know you and your story. Exactly! Yes. - You really love your work. - So do you. I guess we both just have big visions for how things could go. Yeah. I think I found the one. Tree. What do you think? Oh, right. Yes. - That is the one. - Yeah. Wow. This isn't on the Timber Grove website. Nope. I'm still renovating it. I love it. You did all this? Well, with a lot of help off hours with the Timber Grove crew. But yeah, I've been working on it for a while. It's almost finished. Obviously, I still need some furniture. I thought you were living here? I am but it's also doing double duty as a prototype. I'm hoping that this will be the company's new direction. You see the future. I see the future. Open, airy, glass... Of course, this sculpture. Yeah, of course, I remember it. Sort of a... a symbol for the company. So, has Gordon seen this place? Nope, not since I started the interior. What if he sees all the work you've done and he's just not interested in changing? Well, then... I guess I just built a really big house of my own. Right. And a house of my own needs a Christmas tree, so what do you say we go grab that tree and get it decorated? Yes. So cute! I totally should've gone through these before inviting you over. No, I'm leaving. I never would've seen your tree. Well, you say you're leaving but you never go. Okay, I mean to. I have to... tomorrow. I think Silver Valley has won you over. Everybody gets sucked back in. Like you did? Well... that's different. Brianna and Gordon... I owe them a lot. You're lucky to have each other. Yeah. You have a train for your tree? Oh, right. Yeah, that's taken a real beating over the years. Wow. I think... yeah. I'm missing a caboose. - What? - Yeah. The best car. In the movies all the important stuff happens around the caboose. Chases. Tearful goodbyes. Reunions. The heart is in that little red car. Hmm. I never thought of it like that. So... you're heading back to Denver tomorrow? Yup. After I see Brianna in the morning. I don't know... I don't know when I'll be back. Thank you so much for helping me with the tree and... Oh yeah. Um... sure. And you have my email if you wanna... Okay. Okay, um... I'll grab my coat. Okay. I wish you could stay for the fundraiser tonight, but... I understand. Well, we will celebrate after the showcase. Oh shoot. I must've left my snowflake hat at the thing the other night. Oh, yeah. Take the access road to the highway, you'll pass the lake, it's on your way. Where are you headed? Oh, to the model cabin. Gotta finish decorating for tonight. Well, I hope you and your dad have a Merry Christmas. Same to you and your mom. Oh, no. Hm. Let's see. Ah, there you are. Hayley! Hey! Hey, I came back to get my hat. You're just out here walking in this cold? Have a seat. Enjoy the fresh air. Ah... This really is a beautiful town. I can see why you found yourself here. Oh, you'll be back. You and Brianna are gonna take the design world by storm. And Jake obviously likes you. Yeah, I don't know about Jake. Well, if you're interested... be a little patient. I'm not known for my patience. I get it. But you know who you are. And I suspect you always have. It's been a bit of a longer road for Jake. He's still finding himself. But he's... he's doing it on his own. Sounds like you know something about that. I never really had a guide in my life. But it sounds like you've been really lucky in your upbringing. I was. Gordon, I... have a confession. When I came here I had this crazy idea. It was far-fetched really, that you were... Gordon? Gordon? Gordon! No. Gordon... Hang on, hang on! Hang on just a second. I'll get help. Okay. I need an ambulance. Hayley! Thank God you were here. I... I... I can't imagine what would've happened. Is he okay? I don't know, they haven't said. The doctor should be out in a few minutes. Come... sit. Renton family? Thank you, Hayley. Someone wants to see you. My guardian angel. You look a lot better than when I last saw you. Thanks to you. Hey doc, you ready to check me out? Not so fast. From what Hayley said when they brought you in, you had a low blood pressure event. I just bent down to pick up my gloves. Well, if your head was anywhere close to being below your heart it can trigger low blood pressure. And given your previous heart attack, we're keeping you in a little longer to adjust your meds. I can't! My fundraiser's tonight. You wanna go to a party? I can't disappoint the kids. Look, I... I promise to take it easy and I'll keep my head above my heart. Come on, doc. Please. If your numbers stay solid and we can adjust your meds in time. Then I'm trusting you. Okay. Thanks doc. Hey. How are you doing, Gordon? I hear the fundraiser is still on for tonight? - Absolutely it's still on. - Great. Okay, yeah, about that. We have a problem. The heat is off in the model cabin, the pipes are frozen and there's water everywhere. You mean you need another place to hold the party tonight? Jake... has a place that you could... Oh, just the cabin I've been working on. I mean, it's not quite finished yet, so I don't know if we could... It's not just a cabin. It is a beautiful space that you have to see and it'd be perfect for tonight. Okay. We'll do it there. Alright. I'll blast out an email to the guests with Jake's address. Great. What did you just do? It's the ideal opportunity. You'll save the day for Gordon. What's the problem? Well, the problem is maybe I wasn't ready and you just volunteered me. It's a remarkable space and... if Gordon's open to expanding the business at all, tonight is the night to show it off. And if not then I've just blown my shot. Yeah, you're... you're absolutely right. I'm... I'm sorry, I should've asked you first. Since you volunteered me... you can help me present it in its best light. You mean stage it for you by tonight? You've got seven hours. You up for it? You have no idea who you're dealing with. Okay. Let's go get my jacket. So we'll do a donation table along the side here. And then conversation spaces over here and here. A couple tall tables for drinks there. And of course, more holiday decorations. Right. You think we can get all of that done? A beautiful space for party guests to donate all their money with a holiday vibe in... six hours and 35 minutes? You bet. - Yeah. - Mmhmm. You know what to do. I do not know what to do. Do you? No clue. Okay, so I'll... Wow. I'm not gonna lie, you're really good at this. I just need a few more small candles so I'm gonna head back into town, see what I can find. Okay. Great. Hey listen, I just wanted to say I was... a little upset before and I'm sorry about that. You only get one shot. I heard you. I just wanna make it the best shot possible, right? Right. Also I, um... I wanna make Silver Valley a place I come back to, if that's something... Yeah. That's... Hey, you two. I could use a little help in here. Alright, what's going on in here? Oh, these are all candy cane cookies. They're the only ones my dad likes to eat. They come out the easiest and you can hang them off your finger when you eat them. My mom always said that. My dad is obsessed. Your... your dad had a heart attack before today. It must've been so scary. I was with him when it happened four years ago. It was... terrifying. I've been trying to get him to scale back but he's so stubborn and protective of his business. I guess it makes sense after having such a rough start in life. Yeah, he mentioned that. He was in foster care and... never got adopted. I just want him to enjoy his golden years. Foster care? He doesn't like to talk about it. But I wish he'd let Jake partner with him and then take over Timber Grove. Yeah, that would be the ideal solution. Jake knows the business inside and out and he'd be perfect for it. Alright, well I am gonna head into town. Can you think of anything else we need? No, you have already thought of everything else. Alright. - Alright Jake, you're up. - Okay. Who wants to party? Hey Dad. Welcome. Oh... decent feel. Very airy. You'll take a hit on your heating costs with those high ceilings and all that glass though. Well, there's extra insulation, energy efficient thermostats, lights, security... and it can all be controlled remotely from a phone. And of course... the heart of the home. It wouldn't be a Timber Grove cabin without it. Spectacular. Truly, it's... it's... it's spectacular. Well done, Jake. Thanks Gordon. Now, how about a drink? Wow. You look... lovely. You like it? I do. You were right. Silver Valley worked its magic on me. Why? You thinking of sticking around... again? I just can't seem to leave no matter how hard I try. Dance with me. This is... You go. No, you go. Don't worry about it. I was just... I was gonna say... I can't believe what you did with this place. It's better than I ever could've dreamt. It was easy. I believe in you. Are you sure you gotta go tomorrow? May I have your attention please. Welcome. Thank you for taking time out of your holiday season. All of your efforts will help Braithwaite's mission to pair foster kids with homes for the holidays. And, of course, the times in between. Did you say Braithwaite? That's what this fundraiser is for? Yes. All this time you've been raising money for Braithwaite? Hayley! Hayley, stop. Was she too much of a burden to straight up abandon her and let her believe... Let who believe? Who are you? Patricia Renton's daughter. Patricia? The sister you left at Braithwaite and never came back for. Did she... did she send you? No. She doesn't know anything about this. And I'm glad now that I see what kind of person you are. What kind of a person pretends to rent a cabin just to get close to people? You know, you could've asked. Instead you just lied. You said, "I don't have any siblings" right to my face but you did. And you broke her heart. What's the bigger lie, huh? Dad? What's going on? Go back inside. I'm fine. My mother Patricia is amazing. She is the kindest, best, biggest-hearted woman I know. You said you had no one. But you had her... and you just left her. I'm sorry. Thank you for everything. I have to go. Dad, who's Patricia? What is going on? Patricia... Patricia is my sister. Dad, can we please talk about this? There's nothing to talk about. I made a decision a long time ago that I honestly thought was the right thing to do. What about Hayley? Hayley left. We gotta move on. Move on from family? Look, I don't expect you to understand. But I need you to respect my decision. You kept family from me, Dad. Look, Brianna... There's stuff about your past you don't wanna talk about... Fine, that's your choice. But you chose for me too. Goodnight Dad. Then she gave me the mudroom. I'm gonna make the best of it, but... You are. You always do. But something more than work is going on, isn't it? I'm just happy to be home with you. That's what family does, stick together, especially during the holiday. And the place looks... beautiful. What changed? Well, I finally figured out you were right. Staying home and mourning didn't alter the fact your father was gone. When I started volunteering, some of that pain began to lift. I needed a push and you gave me one. When I was little I used to write a Christmas card to Gordon every year. But this year I wrote a new one. It won't reach him... but I finally feel like I've closed the door on him being gone. So... thanks for helping me do that. I can't believe it. When they took away the study and gave me this room I was so upset. It's called turning a lemon into lemonade. Life is so funny, isn't it? This was so much more challenging than the study and so much more fun. I told you you'd knock it out of the park. - You ready? - Let's do this. Hey everyone. Hayley Brandt coming to you live with advanced peeks from Mrs. Peterson's designer showcase house. I can't show you the whole room, you'll have to wait until opening day, but I can tell you I have never been prouder of any design I've worked on. And just wait until you see the incredible furniture I've included from Brianna Renton at Meadowlark Designs located in beautiful Silver Valley. If you like what you see I'd love to hear from you. Merry almost Christmas, friends. Brianna. Can we stop pretending nothing happened? I hope Santa makes all your wishes come true. Merry Christmas Eve. Your mother's really made these kids' holiday. I think that maybe they've made hers. Want a teddy bear? Patricia? Patricia. We're about to lose a staff member. Our community partnership person is leaving at the first of the year. - Merry Christmas. - Oh... Now can you think of anyone better for the job because I certainly can't. Oh... that's great. Thank you. Who's car is that? Mom, there's something I need to tell you. Um... uh, the reason that I went to Silver Valley wasn't for furniture. Patricia. Gordon? That's what I was trying to say. What? Hayley found me. She found all of us. This is your niece. Brianna Renton. And this is Jake Pierce, my business partner. Could we, uh... I got in a lot of trouble after I aged out. I knew if I was a part of your life, no one would adopt you. I didn't care about that. I only wanted to be with you. I could barely take care of myself. How could I take care of an 11-year-old? At my hearing a judge gave me a choice... Jail or the military... and I enlisted. You could've found me after. All these years I thought you must've died or you would've come back for me. I am so sorry. I thought I was doing the right thing. And I did... I did come find you. I learned that you had been adopted by a wonderful family and I didn't wanna screw that up. And I thought after all this time you wouldn't wanna see me anyway. I did. I always did. I missed you so much in my life. And I have missed you. Will you stay? Spend some of the holiday with Hayley and me. Absolutely. Thank you. I hear you're a wonderful furniture designer. Thanks. Best in Colorado. Look Dad, peppermint candy cane cookies, your favorite. Old family recipe. Maybe we could have some for dessert. Perfect. I wanted to call. Me too. But the way I handled things, I... No, you did what you needed to do. But the thing between us... that felt real. A smart man made me realize that closing myself off was a terrible way to live. And you listened to him? So, if, uh... you're gonna be working with Brianna and you and your mom wanna spend more time with Gordon... and the distance between Denver and Silver Valley won't seem so far, if you know... you're interested. It's about time. It's time for dinner! I have something for you. This is the last Christmas card I wrote to you after you disappeared. And this is the one I wrote to you this year. After Hayley started asking questions about you, I never thought I'd be able to give it to you in person. And I'm so very grateful that I can. Oh... One second. I wrote one by hand every year. I never sent them to you but I thought about you and I missed you every Christmas. To family. To family. Merry Christmas.
