I didn't bring the dough. What do you mean, you didn't bring the dough? You promised! Well, since I'm not going... Perlman! Dave! Are we still going? Of course! We have a plan! We're sticking to the plan. The bell goes at 3:00, so do we. Am I right? What about your money? Don't worry. I'll get the money. Look, will you just lend me the money? No! Absolutely not. I'm not in the lending business. This will be great for your french essay. Bon soir. Damn it, wimp. It's only 95 bucks. My name is Wendell, and $95 is a lot of money. I'll advance it if you take me along. We can't take a kid along! We're going into the mouth of hell. You got a review of David Copperfield? Sure. Business is business. I go or no dough. David Copperfield, huh? One of my old standbys. I just can't believe it! You! Carol, what did you expect me to do? I didn't expect you to go there. If I can wait, why can't you wait? What are you going for? You get action all the time. Hey, variety... It's the spice of life. Besides, I've never seen the donkey. Donkey?

The little capitalist has us by the short hairs. Us? He's got you, Dave. Well, it's my car. Hmm. Let's get one thing straight, wimp. We may be stuck with you, but you won't ruin our trip, just 'cause you're a brat kid. We're going to be as crude, filthy, and gross as we want. You understand that, wimp? The name is Wendell, and why should today be any different? You got to win her respect because even a whore likes a man she can respect. You stay here with the wheels. Bring me some twinkies.

Is you gotta make her come. It's the only way to win her respect. The only way is to Jack off her so you're not too horny. She is so cheap! Look, you're acting like a fool. I don't care if I act like a fool. I feel like a fool! It was just a physical thing. Oh, fine, well, that makes it all right, doesn't it? You're making too much out of this. Too much? Hey, I thought we had something here. Me and you, buster! You're making a mountain out of a molehill! Why are you walking away from me? There's work to do! Fine, fine. Let's not talk about it.

I heard from first-hand experience. This guy I know at city college got a hold of them spanish flies, and used 'em on his girlfriend 'cause she wasn't putting out for him. You see, he made a big mistake. He gave her a whole one when he should have given her half. Anyway, he left her alone for a few minutes, went into a liquor store, came out. You wouldn't believe what he found. The girl on the gearshift knob dead. There. You see? You see? You know him, don't you? Same story, Dave. You shouldn't talk that way in front of your little brother. Thanks, but I'm already used to it. Yuck! Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Look! Stop the car. Pull over. Well, this is as far as I go. Kathy, after you're through, why don't we have a drink or something? That's funny. Bye, now. Bye. I thank you. Thank you, David. Thank you, all. Wendell, don't let them get you into any trouble!

What's the big deal, man? We haven't done anything. Haven't you heard about the tj cops and the Tijuana jails? They throw you in and throw away the key. Holy shit. This is just what I need. Hello, officer. How you doing? '57 belair, huh? Yes, sir. Pop the hood. Iandale! Full house, eh? Yeah. It's a 301 backed by, uh, dual quads there. Englebrock manifold, hooker headers, with electric cutouts... That's right. I put a lot of hours in this baby. What's the E.T.? 15.76. This would make one hell of a police car. Did I tell a joke? Huh? Why did you laugh? No reason. Sometimes I just... I see many expensive cars cross the border with boys like you driving them. How does such a boy get the money for such a car? I work for it. And you make enough to buy this car? Well, not exactly. I mean, my parents loaned me some of the money. Most of the money. I see. Close the hood. Oh, um, your right brake light is out. Oh, man, come on. Did your friend say something? No, sir... How much do you want? What? Isn't that what this is all about? Spider! We ain't got mucho dinero, so how about 5 bucks and you let us go, huh? I mention the brake light because someone might hit you. True, it is a violation. He wants more money. Will you shut up? Are you doing business with that man there? I am getting it tuck-and-rolled. Hey, Chuey. Si. Si, jefe. Ok. As a favor to him, I'll forget what just happened here. But your friend should go home and learn some manners. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I got this funny feeling. This feeling that I just might see you again. Let's hope not.

Mail it back to me with the proper documentation. The moment I have received it from our giant, friendly neighbors to the north, you are a free woman. May I give you one small piece of advice? Go home directly. Do not stay in Tijuana. Your emotions are too delicate at this moment for this uncouth place. Listen, you know what you've got to be careful of? That they don't stuff your seats with horseshit. No lie. It happened to a friend of mine. They dry it so you can't smell it, but as soon as it gets wet... Come on. That's why you're staying here and watching them. Forget it. I'm here on business. What? I brought you here against my will. Help me, or you're taking the bus home. If you... aah! Which is it? Stop! Stop! The bus home? You nervous? After all, there's only one first time. Come on. I believe these are the colors you wanted? Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's going to look sharp. Come on, Dave.

When's the donkey go on? You'll know when. After a while. You're going in there? You want the best spanish fly. I've already been in there. He tried to shoot me. He has to be careful. This is very illegal. I know this man. He trusts me. He doesn't know you. ¿¿Comprende? I get you. It shows to go you, you got to have connections. Yeah. You'll get exactly what you deserve, Dave. I told you he could get them. She'll be begging for it. Here you go. The last six he had. I gave him an extra $2.00. So that's 12 I owe you? Remember, they're extra strong, so half a pill. Right, right. There's 4 more for the taxi. Damn, that cleans me. I guess we'll walk back. Yeah, it's faster. Buenas noches, can I help you? Ah, yes. We would like a room please. Well... here we are. Here we are. You probably think I'm... I'm kind of a sophisicated older woman. I'm not. I wish I were. It might make all of this alot easier. Well, uh. Maybe not easy. You see, uh. I've never even kissed another guy. I mean, since I was married. So... Donkey, donkey, donkey! Jesus! Sorry. Asshole! Look, I said I was sorry. OK? What am I supposed to do now? You can pull it over your head and suck on it. Oh yeah, Pussy? Get your hands off me. That's Mr. Pussy to you. Alright? Fight! Wimp. I'm not like ordinary guys. I got more of those hormones or something. You know, like a male nymphomaniac. I feel sorry for you, Dave. Then loan me a few bucks, so I can go to another whorehouse. Forget it. I'm foaming at the mouth. I can't keep it down anymore. Down boy, down boy. Gross. What? Look at that set of jugs. Dave, don... Hello. Will you settle down?! What's the matter, you deaf? All right. Everybody take it easy, eh? Get off. Hey, cut that! Hey, you! You. Whee. Whee. I didn't mean to come on too strong. The music's bitchin'. Thought you'd like to dance. Thanks anyways. Have I got B.O. Or something? Please, go away. That sure is good-looking punch you got there. I'll tell you what. I'll be right over there if you want me for any reason at all. I'll be right over there waiting, ok? Just remember. Struck out, huh? Yeah, right, wimp. Soon she'll be over here begging for it. What do you mean? I slipped her some fly. What? You're pretty lucky. Why's that? If I thought that stuff really worked, I'd tell her. Say one word, they'll eat you for tacos tomorrow. Relax and wait till the stuff takes hold. Come on. Lay off me. You come down here for a good time? I'll show you one. Get in there! Are you ok? Was it something I did wrong? No. It was wonderful. Everything it used to be a long time ago with him. Spider? No. Larry. That was Spider in that police car. Are you sure? That's the road out of town. Come on. This is ridiculous. How long... Hey, look. It's starting to take effect. She's getting twitchy. That was a mosquito, Dave. Hey, look. Did I show you my new watch? That's a genuine Bulova. Oh, uh... Solid gold, too, I'll bet. That's right. Hey! Check out that model A. You are interested in something besides sex. Hey-y-y. Boss model A. Yours? Yeah. What have you got in it? A Chevy block and a La Salle transmission. A La Salle transmission? Bitchin'. Where did you find it? I work in a junkyard. Got any more there? No. You got a car? I got a '57 Chevy getting tuck-and-rolled at vaca Negro's. Chuey. He does good work. You gotta be careful he doesn't stuff your seats with horseshit. What? I'm just kidding. Just a joke. Just a joke. Hey, you got lots of nice-looking girls around here. There's lots of good-looking women in Tijuana. You ever use spanish fly on them? There's no such thing. That's just for the tourists. Oh, yeah? Take a look at these. That's aspirin. Bullshit. I paid 3 bucks a piece for those. Maybe so. It's still aspirin. We'll see about that. See that chick over there? Which chick? The chick standing right over there. She'll be climbing the walls soon. That chick right there? Mm-hmm. That chick is my sister, man. Hey! Put him in the car. I'm going to teach yo a lesson, Chulo, you and your friend. Put him in. Don't hurt me! What the hell do you think you're doing? Hey, I didn't mean it! Stop this car right now! Stop it! All right, let's go. Come on. Look, can't we work this out? I told you to go home and learn some manners, kid. Now you will learn them here. Get inside! What if he's not at the jail? He's got to be there. If they took him this way, he's in the Tijuana jail. He'll need a good lawyer. This man... he's the best lawyer in all Tijuana. Morales. Oh, I know this guy. He does divorces, right? Just tell him Carlos sent you. Ok if I sit here? You ask me if you want something. Sorry. I didn't know. Is it ok if I sit here? No. All right. Not there. Give me a break, will you? El quiere su mama. You want your mama? Hey, look... I'm your mama here. Don't do that. You fight me. You win, you do anything you want. I don't want to fight you, ok? Come on. Bye-bye, gringo. Now you can sit there. How many times does a guy got to say he's sorry? How was I to know she was your sister? You knew she was somebody's sister. Excuse me. Yes. We saw you drive by with our friend. Did you bring him here? Yes. He's in the jail. Go to the line, and talk to the officer. What did he do? How do we get him out? You don't get him out. What do you mean? Perdoname, señor. Oh, hablas español, señorita. Would it be possible to speak with you a moment... Privately? I'm scared, Dave. What are they going to do to us? I don't know. Leave him alone. He's just a kid! We won't hurt him. We want him to see what we do to you. You wanted a La Salle transmission. There's one back here. I don't really want one. Help! I'm sorry, wimp! You're not suggesting a bribe? Oh, of course not. We would just like to pay his fine in advance. Ok? I don't like to see american boys in jail, but your friend is held on a serious charge. The fine could be quite large. How large? Uh... Maybe, uh... $3,000. $3,000? We can't pay that much. Ok. He goes before the judge tomorrow. Wait. What will the judge give him? Oh, three, four years. If you want to see me, I'll be in my office. Senor, why are you... What did he really do? He pissed me off. Hey. Lookee here. As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. Get up, geek. Get up before I stomp you to death. Is it just you, or do I have to take on all three of you? Wise ass. It's because of you we're in here. Yeah? Welcome to my cell. If you want to talk to my friend or anybody else, you talk to me first. ¿¿Comprende? Ay-yi-yi. What about his family? His mother, you mean. She hasn't got any money. She doesn't care what happens to him anyway. Wait a minute. Come on. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! What are you doing? You'll find out. Find out what? We're not going to hurt him, are we? We're just going to scare the hell out of him. Despacio, huh? Hey, Chulo. You ever hear of the Ouacan revenge? No. In Mexico, we have an old custom. When a man makes his masculine parts offensive to those around him, the offending organ... Is eliminated. What? Ha ha ha! Armando, bajalo. Oh, no! No! Please, don't! Hey, you, gringo. Me? Let's go. Your fine has been paid. Adios, amigo. Adios. Hey. The MPs will have us out of here, and when they do, you're dead. Yeah? Says who, dick-breath? Jesus. Listen, I'm sorry about... Forget it. Let's go. Thanks a lot. Americans like you come to Mexico to do things you wouldn't do in your own country. This is our country, man. That's right, ese. You treat us like pigs. You think we're dirty because our town's dirty. This isn't our town, man. This is your town. Without you and people like you, there would be no Tijuana. Armando, bajalo. Mas. I didn't mean it! No! No! Oh, no! No! Please, don't! Wimp! Aah! No! No! No, please! Please don't! You are huge. Our money! We'll give you our money! Please! Wimp! Give them the... wimp! Hey, where's the kid? My car! Just wait till you come back! Vamos! Oh, gosh. Wimp! Hurry! Don't worry, Dave. I'll get you down. Hurry! Hurry! Wimp! The other way! Don't just sit there! Do something! Come on! They're going to kill us! We're going to die! Thank god! Wimp, hurry! They're going to kill us! Hey, come back! Pussies! Friggin' pussies! Ha ha ha! Wimp! Watch out! Wimp! My name is Wendell. I love you, Wendell! I love you, Wendell! All right, let's go. ¿¿Que pasa, Chuey? Hola, jefe. Nos a ver el trabajo, hombre. Hey, that is beautiful. That's a nice job. Let's get to business. Where's your friend who owns it? He'll be here any minute. ¿¿Jefe, que lo esta pasando? Aqui no pasa nada. El carro es mio, mano. Is this true? Yes, uh... We made a deal. You're not going to believe what happened. We were almost murdered, but wimp... I mean Wendell saved our lives, I swear. Oh, yeah? Some weird things have happened here, too, Dave. What's that cop doing to my car? He's looking at your motor. Dave... I don't trust that guy. Kathy, you'll never believe what happened. What? What is it? How much is your car worth? I wouldn't sell it for a million bucks. You know that. Dave. What? What?! It's a long story, but all that's important is they threw Spider in the Tijuana jail. They were going to give him 4 years. To get him out, I told that cop you'd give him your car. I know it's bad, but we're all... Give him my car? You're out of your mind! Hold on. This is my baby. Old yo-yo's been making deals without my say-so. What do you mean? Just what I said. You lied to me, huh? "Lie," sir, is a strong word. I truly believed Dave would give up... Wait a second. This isn't my fault. I like Spider, but these are my wheels you're talking about. Look, you want a car? Why don't you take that car? It's got mexican plates. Where did you get that car? There were these guys, and they took me to the junkyard and... You stole the car, huh? Wait a second! You're going to go to jail, too. You straighten the thing out there. Reconsider the original offer, Dave. What? Give him your car. Give him your car. Uh, sir... What? I've reconsidered, and I... You can have my car. How about this? I take your car, I take that car, and I take you to jail. I mean right now. Come on, move it. Hold it up. I've got an idea. What idea? What? You're going to go to jail, too. I got another deal. I don't want to hear any more of your deals. Deal! I want to offer you... Aah! Aah! Get his gun. I'm going to slap your face. Let me get the handcuffs. verygood. Hold his hands up. Get rid of it! Ow! A little bit farther over here. The car! Get in the car! You will never get out of this! Let's go. Come on, out of here, let's go. Out of here! Where are the keys? You forgot to pay for the tuck-and-roll. Pay him, pay him, Wendell. David. Chuey, what are you doing? Here. It's all there, Chuey. Hey. Chuey! Dave, come on! Stop! Go! Hey, muchachos, take me with you! We can follow them! Wait for me, hombres! Hey! Chuey! ¿¿Por que lo diste la llave, mano? Porque me pagaron por el tuck-and-roll. Oh, no. Carro, mano. ¡Apaganlo! ¿¿Te pasa? Ha ha ha! Who are they? Those guys want to kill me and Wendell. We gotta get across the border. Where is the border? Isn't it back the other way? It's straight. That's it over there. All right, playboy, get in. ¡Ay cabrón!! What really pisses me off about leaving T.J. Is we won't get another crack at that punk. Hey, that was... Oh, no! Whooooaa! God damn it! What happened? They went that way! All right! Get those mothers! Hey, hey, hey! Stop the car. Larry! Larry! I don't believe it. What are you doing? There was a pepsi bottle down here. You son of a... Light me. ¿¿Que pasó? ¡Ay, chinga! Aah! Banzai! To the border! Simply savages. Best body shop in all Tijuana. Tell them Fernando sent you. Oh, no, we're cooked! We can't make it across that. What are we going to do? Se venden dulces de Mexico. He'll be here any second. Just pray your guts out. Where the hell are you going? Oh, that's great. He's the one that got us into this. Jerk! Excuse me, sir. Yeah, what is it? I just wanted to say if you find anything in that red '57 Chevy, I didn't have anything to do with it. In fact, I hardly know those guys. Is that a fact? Just keep it going now. Pass right through here. Moving right along. That's it. Nice and easy. Right up through here. Phil, you want to grab that? Got it. Will he come after us? Not a chance. He can't say we reneged on a bribe. Just a little further. Hey, Mike, I think I found something. Oh, that. It's just a sock. Take them down. Take them down! It's just a joke. Pull it out. Just an empty sock. No, thanks. Two points. Did you check in there already? Yeah. What are you, some kind of wise guy? You got a real funny friend there. Ok, boys, put it back together. Wait, no. Let me put it back together. Seriously, you're going to scratch it. I just can't get over seeing him down there like that. You still love him, don't you? Listen, Kathy... I live in oceanside. Oh, my god. It's him. Larry! Larry! I've been looking for you all night. I saw you. I couldn't believe it. I thought I lost you. We have a lot to talk about. Kathy. Could you wait right here just a minute? I'll be right back. Well... Here we are. Yeah. Here we are. Looks like old Woody lost more than his jacket down in Tijuana. Oh. You ok? Yeah. I'm ok. Bus to Oceanside, Camp Pendleton, leaving in 5 minutes. Bus leaving in 5 minutes for Oceanside and Camp Pendleton. He's cute. He is cute. Your hat! You want it? Four? Straight to the back.
