She never wanted to leave Seattle. She's a rainy person. She's going to Seattle. - How about showing a little tact, huh? - I can't believe you're the same guy who got me high the first time. - I'm not.

I tried that before, remember? It didn't work out too well. - When? When have you ever tried to help me. - You know exactly when. - You narced and had me thrown into rehab. - I was trying to help you. - Well you have a funny way of showing it. - Do you remember how hard you worked before mom, how motivated you were? And then six months later, you're stealing jewelry from estelle. What did you want me to do? - I don't know, Philip. What about acting like a brother and talking to me? What about Megan, I'm worried, I think you might have a problem. - Megan, I'm worried. I think you have a problem. - See, it wasn't that hard. - You know I think that we've taken this far enough. Okay, let's just turn around and go home and hope that she calls. - I can't. If I don't find estelle, I'm in some serious trouble. - Because of the accident? It's not like you forced her to get high. - Not because of the accident. I kind of did something that in retrospect might not have been the smartest move. - What?

I saw an opportunity to get myself out of a rut and I took it. - A rut? A rut! You turned our grandmother into a fugitive drug smuggler, that's a rut? - 30 percent of the profits, Philip. I'll give you 30 percent of whatever I make if you help me get out of this. - You want to help me? You want to help estelle? This is such a crock.
