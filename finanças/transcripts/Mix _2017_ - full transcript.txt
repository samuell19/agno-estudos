Actually... I'm getting married. His proposal was so passionate. Eventually, I gave in. Sorry, I didn't mean to abandon you. He's a doctor making 40 million yen a year. Half French, half Japanese. We're flying to Provence tomorrow. MIX! Hey! Hey! Wait a minute! "Table tennis taught me some universal truths about life." Lulu-chan, dinner. "Truth #1." "Glory can drive a person crazy." "My mother was living proof." "She was the devil incarnate." "Figuratively speaking, of course. She really looks like this." You can't hide from me. "Not that different." Where do you belong? "Flower Table Tennis Club" Forward! Forward! Lean into it! Attack! Don't you want to be #1, you idiot? I said, lean into it! You're a prodigy! You belong atop a podium! "Truth #2." "Every parent wants to believe their child is a genius." "They're out of touch with reality." Congratulations. "A real genius would be him." In the singles Boys' Hopes Division, the winner is Akihiko Ejima. Shame on you for losing to a player below your rank! Quit if you aren't serious! OK, I'll quit. Don't be spineless! Who asked you? "Truth #3." "A prince will rescue me from this living hell." Ejima! Let's go. "That sort of miracle never happens." Look at me! Hey! "Truth #4." "People often realize what's important when it's too late." I imposed my dreams on you. You can quit table tennis. Mom... A simple life. An ordinary existence is the greatest happiness. I'm glad you finally understand. But I'd rather you continue. "She was still crazy." If there's anything you'd like to place in the coffin, please do so now. Tamako...the lid won't close. "I was finally free to lead a normal life." Say "Cheese!" "I led an ordinary adolescence and found an ordinary job." "I want to fall in love and start an ordinary family." "Yes, I'm ready." About that mixer tonight... I think I can make it. You need another girl, right? Misaki was able to come after all. Sorry! Maybe next time! Oh, that's good. "I'm 28 years old." "I realize my lack of a mate is becoming a serious issue." Oh, sorry! "Miracles don't happen in real life..." "Princes don't appear out of the blue." Are you okay? Thank you. Here. "Join the Corporate Table Tennis Team!" Akihiko Ejima. I came here to pursue higher heights. My goal is to win Nationals. And to rule the world! I'm counting on your support. You can do it, Akihiko! Thanks to Ejima's prodigious talents, we won the championship in our first year. - Thank you. - This isn't my job. Now for a celebratory performance by the cheerleaders of General Affairs! OK, let's go! That's too heavy for you. Someone has to do it. By tomorrow. Please don't! You may hurt your back. I can't stand by and watch a lady do all the heavy lifting. Ready? What's your name again? Tomita of General Affairs. Tamako Tomita. I'll call you Tama-chan. I thought so. A watermelon seed. You're so quiet. I don't know anything about table tennis... That's what I like about you. That's all everyone talks about. When I'm with you, I feel relieved. "One of life's truths debunked." It's a nice day. "Miracles do happen sometimes." Let's take a 5 minute break. Whoa! This is delicious! Did you make it? - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. This is for you. Thanks. It's cute. And... one from me. Thank you. Tama-chan. - Come. - What? Just try it. I can't. I've never played before. If you win, I'll do anything you say. Anything? Anything. I'll never win. How do you do. I'm Airi Ogasawara. I was recruited by several companies, but I made my decision when my hero, Akihiko Ejima, asked me to join him. I'll do my best to shine for this company! You can do it, Airi! You can do it. You're our sun! It's too hard. It's too hard. Akihiko? "Hi, it's me. I know the tournament's coming up." "I don't want to bother you. Just wanted to hear your voice." "I'm playing 'mixed' with Ogasawara." "That's male/female mixed doubles." "To be honest, we have no chemistry." "It's exhausting." "Wow. That must be hard." "I can't wait for it to be over so I can be with you." Surprise! Go, go, Ejima! You can do it, Airi! You're the ultimate pair! "Letter of Resignation" Hey! Hey! Wait a minute! I smell like vomit. Where did she go? What do you think? A young woman on a public train, reeking of alcohol? Her parents didn't raise her right. "Tomita Taxi" You look like a beanpole. Take this one, too. Listen. I'm going to work you hard. Answer me! Yes. Yes, sir! Yes, sir... I'm going to work. Have a nice day. You can stay as long as you like. But a small contribution would be nice. I have debts. Debts? Not that much. I signed as a guarantor for a friend who opened a BBQ restaurant. I haven't seen him since. You can't just sign things. I know. So... I'm thinking of selling the club. We hardly have any members. There's no one to coach. Mom's been dead for 13 years. She'll understand. The glory days of table tennis are over. We have to be realistic. "Flower Table Tennis Club" "Don't you want to be #1, you idiot?" Tamako? It's you! It's me, Yayoi! With the backhand drive! Hey. Tamako! What a joke. It's just a hangout spot now. There's no coach. I'm the only one with experience. And I was the rebel, remember? Your hair was bright red. Now I'm just a celebrity wife. You married a doctor. I was better at finding a man than table tennis. I was so bored, I took it up again. What brings you back, Tamako? Um. Why don't you try coaching, if you have time on your hands? I haven't held a racket for 15 years. I've forgotten the rules. With you here, we'll get more members. It'll be like the good old days. The current members love this club. It's an important place for them. Yayoi. For me, table tennis was a dark place that I finally escaped. I'll never go back again. I don't plan on staying here long. I have an offer from a big international firm. It's good for my career. What you doing, Ms. Tomita! What I tell you? You so clumsy! This is the international firm? Men... They're all the same. Don't waste your tears. A: Forget about him! B: Steal him back! I choose A. Good! Good for you, Tamako! Mapo Tofu, coming up! Go ahead and eat! Here you go. It's too spicy! Prefectural Tournament, Bambi Division, Boys and Girls Table Tennis Champion. Oh my god. Prefectural Tournament Hopes Division Winner. I'm Tamako Tomita. Motonobu Ochiai, age 52! Owner of Ochiai Farms! Member: 3 years, 8 months! Penholder grip, backhand drive! I'm Mika Ochiai. I grow cherry tomatoes with my husband. Not to brag but, try my tomato "mochi" cakes. I'm...Yuma Sasaki. Age 17, chopper. OK, all right. Who's going to take on the prodigy? No, not me. Come on. You go. Hi. He's new. A beginner... What's your name? Pervert. You owe me for dry cleaning. You...lay on top of me. - "On top?" - So it's my fault? You lay on top of me, so I couldn't hold myself back. You could barely walk. It was so hard. Because you were all over me. - If you hadn't been staring... - What are you talking about? His nose is bleeding. Help him. Apply pressure. You started today? If I win, pay my dry cleaning bill. Beanpole. Carry this, too. Get serious or you won't get your paycheck. You need money right? Alimony? Child support? What? What's with that look? Wanna fight? Go for it, you punk! I'll report you! Hit me! Come on! Found it! They're so cool! Cute and cool! Take our picture! Yeah! "Table Tennis Digest Hot doubles!" I got it. - One more. - Another one? Ready? She's amazing. Yayoi can barely keep up. It's like real table tennis! Don't smash the ball every time. You're just a beginner. Basics first! Return the ball. I said, don't smash the ball. Return it. Don't smash it. "You two are the talk of the town." "Rumor has it that you're dating." "Oh, no. He's my idol. He's way beyond reach." "But we do have good chemistry." "'1+1 doesn't always equal 2 in doubles." "Sometimes it equals 3 or 4." "With Airi, it equals 50." "To be honest, I think we're unbeatable!" "We'll win the Nationals!" "Good luck." If you win, I'll do anything you say. Anything? Anything. Switching from Option A to B. "How nostalgic." "It's been 20 years since we won the Regional Championships together." We were unbeatable! You're working at the ward office now? I started coaching at the club. "In that case, maybe I'll play again. I need the exercise." Thanks! As you know our club is facing financial difficulties. I'll be frank. At this rate, we'll have to close. We have to increase membership. I distributed flyers, but it's not working. There's only one way to sell our club. We have to win a tournament. Let's enter the Nationals. Enter the what? The National Table Tennis Championships! It's no joke. Anyone who registers can compete. If we do well, it'll be great advertisement. Tamako, I think you're overestimating us. My average record is 0 wins, 35 losses. Not to brag, but I don't mind losing. I have a plan. We'll only enter the "mixed" category. "Mixed"...As in mixed doubles? I set it! There are fewer mixed entrants, so we stand a chance. Most singles players don't even consider it. No one trains specifically for mixed doubles. If we train solely as doubles for the next month, we can compete. Tamako... That's a great idea! It's the only way! Let's all enter! Sorry, but I'm not... It's not mandatory. You don't have to. Let's partner up. Yayoi and Yuma are both choppers. The Ochiais are natural partners. How about you? My partner will arrive shortly. Tama-chan! Let me introduce you. He was the indisputable ace of our club. Who are you? Kazuaki. I hurt my knee walking all the way over. I don't think I can play. I'm going to the clinic. Ow... Let's choose new partners! Out of my way! Back off! Why do we have to take turns? That's the rules! Apply the glue. Not that much. Spread it out evenly. Move. You're pretty handy. You're pretty clumsy. Let's go wild tomorrow! Flower Table Tennis Club will take the tournament by storm! Here you go. Eat up, and get fired up! Bon appetite! So spicy! Did you follow the recipe? Cho! Maybe not. It's me. How are you? It's nothing really. I'm entering a table tennis tournament. I am. I thought Shiori may be interested. "National Table Tennis Tournament, Kanagawa Prefecture Preliminaries" "Thank you for coming to the 2016..." Wow! It's huge! These uniforms? A buddy made them for cheap. My wife designed them. Too understated? Not at all. "We will begin in a few minutes." "Hagiwara" Name goes in the back. "To ensure the best playing conditions for our athletes..." It's him! Ejima's face is so tiny! Airi is slimmer in person. Really. He's coming this way. This isn't happening! Here he is! Long time no see. I never heard from you. You look good. We play you in Round 3. Hagiwara... Are you the Hagiwara? I saw you fight at Korakuen Hall! Oh, sorry. I talk too much. I look forward to our match. See you. Fight? Let's get ready! "Kanagawa Prefecture Preliminaries" "Mixed Doubles, Round 1..." Tamako. Right. Let's go. Let's do it. "You may begin your matches now." "For those of you in the audience, please applaud and cheer for your athletes." Both tend to rush the offense. "Yokohama University, Ryuji Tokushima (Shakehand grip, backhand drive)" Apply consistent topspin and they should crumble. "Yokohama University, Moe Matsuda (Shakehand grip, backhand drive)" Kill 'em with your sidespin! First game: Yokohama University. It's starting, honey! Our opponents are waiting! Kanagawa Police Department! Go, go Yamashita! Go, go Sato! Go, go Yamashita! Go, go Sato! "Kanagawa Police Dept. Seiichiro Yamashita (Penhold grip, forehand drive)" "Kanagawa Police Dept. Fuka Sato (Shakehand grip, backhand drive)" Officer Sato! If we lose, don't bother returning to the force! Yes, Chief Yamashita! I won't let you down! Flower Table Tennis Club vs. Kanagawa Police Dept. Best of five! The girl is good. Attack the guy. What was that again? Long, short, underspin, topspin, sidespin. Can't we just say it? Seriously? The tournament staff is here. He gets the runs when he's nervous. Honey! Hurry! Thank you. Honey! You're here. We were slaughtered. You? We forfeited. How about them? "That's what I like about you." "When I'm with you, I feel relieved." "I can't wait for it to be over so I can be with you." "Shame on you for losing to a player below your rank!" "I'm entering a table tennis tournament." "I thought Shiori may be interested." No! Stop it! Ow. Are you OK? It hurts. Flower Table Tennis Club will forfeit due to an injury. The match goes to the Kanagawa Police Department. Be careful. Take it slow. Oh, gosh. Eat this, Yuma. You'll be fine. Is it good? "Victory for Ejima & Airi!" Here you go. It's delicious. I'm embarrassed... I can't cook as well as you all. Dr. Yoshioka must be so proud of his beautiful wife. He'll be Head of Internal Medicine soon. Thank you for supporting him. Please eat. I'm picking these. I'm tired. Me, too. Shall we downsize? So we can manage on our own? It's not like we have any heirs. There he goes again. Cutting class probably. Weirdo. "Ping-Pong Club" Beanpole. I guess you're not a total loser. I brought you some lunch. How romantic. Don't get big-headed. Let's go. They're so crude. Don't try anything funny. I wanted to apologize for forcing you to compete. Come back. We need members. How's your ankle? Walking is good rehab for my ankle. What are you doing, you perv! Hey! All done. This is how you bandage an ankle. Who are you? Tell me a little about yourself. Everyone is creeped out by you. Including me. An ex-pro boxer. Ranked #2 nationally. - Are you serious? - I'm not a perv. They were wearing my daughter's school uniform. I thought they may know her. Daughter? My ex-wife's daughter actually. When she called me "Dad", I... But I can't see her. Why not? I retired three years ago from an eye injury. I tried regular jobs, but none stuck. I came home drunk one night, and found my wife with another man. Typical. I know. A boxer falling from grace. It was all a misunderstanding. He was just my wife's boss, giving her advice. That's the pits... That's borderline perve. No wonder you can't see her. I heard she joined the table tennis club. I wanted to play with her someday. That's why you joined? How pitiful. I know things can never return to normal. What's this? Wedding ring. That my wife threw at me. Ew! Get rid of it! I've tried to throw it out, but... You think she'll ever take it back? Are you stupid? I'm getting goosebumps! You have to move on! Have you moved on? - Huh? - That guy. What are you... With the pierced ear. I don't know what you're... He dumped you, right? Let's not do this. You'll feel better if you tell him how you feel. Maybe even punch him. Here, stand up. Put your weight behind it and aim for the jaw. Even you could take him down. The jaw. That's right. Come on. Like this? Just like that. Quicker! Come on, ace! Move your feet! Give me all you got! What's with the look? Wanna be #1? Are you all talk? Your feet aren't moving! Okay! Now, focus! Return the ball! All right! I'm ashamed. I entered the tournament for a man. It's disrespectful to the sport. How could I win? For real? When? I swear, it was Miss Tomita. That's scary! She's a total stalker! She actually thought you'd marry her and made you lunch. Which tasted crappy. Who knew she was so desperate? I should have known when she knitted me that scarf. How about when she wrapped herself up like a present? - No way! - Right? - A new rubber. - You changed it? Yeah, but it's too springy. - Try a medium. - It won't be springy enough. That's a mighty fine racket. The rubber especially. You must be handy. Anyone can do it. Not everyone, actually. You guys may not understand, but in this world, there are some hopelessly clumsy people. But... don't put down people who are trying their best. Ow. Sorry. I'm a man who lost his job and was abandoned by his family. You're a girl who was dumped and fled to her hometown. What a miserable pair we are. The worst. But... You can still play, right? A 15 year break? So what? Some people can't play, even if they want to. We'll kill 'em next year. I can't hear you! OK! Are you OK? Work on that ankle, Tamako. Work on that backhand, Hagi. I have a revolutionary solution for a weak backhand. Two rackets, no more backhand. We'll be disqualified, too. But you're good with your left. I was a southpaw in boxing so my left side is stronger. Why didn't you tell me? Huh? A right left combination is ideal! Now you tell me... Let's practice. We came to train! Your strongest pair, please! Take! Nanami! "Takeru Gotoda (Shakehand grip, backhand drive)" "Nanami Hidaka (Shakehand grip, unconventional style)" Hey, old man. You know how to play? You suck! It's not even a game. What the hell? They're just provoking us. Hey, old lady. You can barely stand. Take some calcium tablets! Who're you calling "old lady"? You suck! It's not even a game. Go drink some baby formula! You're so immature! Your strongest pair, please! We'll take you on. Show me what you got! "Jane Esmeralda (Shakehand grip, forehand/backhand drive)" "Tetsu Yoneda (Shakehand grip, backhand drive)" Mixed doubles? Sorry to confuse you. I know he's cute, but he's a man. - I wasn't talking about him. - Whatever. Who cares? How rude! You have to practice against strong players. There's not much choice around here. Still too spicy! Did you follow the recipe? You come! You're Chinese, right? Don't you play table tennis? Don't stereotype. It's discriminatory. Not all Brazilians play soccer. We terrible at table tennis. He's joking. Don't mind him. He and me dropped from Chinese National A-List Team. We useless. We no reason to live. "Schezuan Restaurant, Cho (Penhold grip, backhand drive)" "Schezuan Restaurant, Yo (Shakehand grip, forehand drive)" All Brazilians do play soccer. We coach you, but Chinese style. Of course. Chinese #1 table tennis. Know why? Chinese #1 hard training. Stand up, piece of trash! You rest when die! Spin! Spin! Bring your load over here. I'll carry it. Don't overdo it. More quick! More strong! More hard! Here you go! Not spicy enough! We need to be on fire. On fire! More chili pepper! "114 more days" "99 more days" Shhh! We did it! You win. What'd he say? No idea. "Ejima Ogasawara pair suffers unexpected loss!" "Ejima Ogasawara pair Yet another loss! Will they break up?" Wow, it's coming along. Are you almost done? Not by a long shot. It'll take years. So... You'll be here for a few years? I have no other job, so I guess. That's too bad. Just to let you know this is my last tournament. My body won't last. I know. So let's win. - You're a strange guy. - Why? You don't have anything at stake in the tournament. But you train hard every day. You're right. Why am I doing this? How would I know? Maybe... I'm falling in love. With table tennis. Oh, well that's good. Stop flirting, you idiots! Idiots! - Skinhead! - It's hot in here! Get the hose! Can I borrow this? Hold this. Skinhead! Hey, skinhead! Hello. Yes? A free trial? Oh, no. I heard Hisashi Hagiwara is training here. - Have some tea. - Thank you. Is he behaving himself? Practicing seriously? Hagi's been great. Hagi. They call dad "Hagi". Sorry. She gives him a hard time, but she's a daddy's girl. We should forgive him already. I suppose. A client of mine is willing to interview him. The company is too good for him. But... Honestly, how is he doing? He's very serious. Even when we go out drinking, he doesn't drink a drop. He's working and training very hard. He... carries your photo with him at all times. Shall we take him back? Really? Yes! But he might not get the job. He doesn't even own a tie. I'll choose one for him. Really? Um... When is that interview? Next Sunday, in Shinjuku. "Tournament: Sunday. Let's work hard this week." Tama-chan. I'm sorry about what I said. It was a terrible thing to say. That's OK. It's true. You're entering again with that guy? What is he to you? What do you mean? My doubles partner. That's all. We're not competing. What? I registered, but not for doubles. Me and Airi are over. You mean as doubles partners? I mean both ways. Tama-chan. I want to be your partner. And I mean both ways. Wait! Tama-chan! Wait, Tama-chan! Stop teasing me. I was stupid! I was thoughtless and I regret it! I believed some rumors about you. Now I know. They just wanted me to pair up with Airi for the publicity. It's too late for that... Actually, I knew from the moment we first met that you were Tamako Tomita, the forehand drive prodigy. You were hiding it, so I pretended not to know. I want you by my side. The only time I didn't feel the pressure to win was when I was with you. I need you. Tama-chan... "6 more days" - You were amazing today, Mika. - Really? See? I'm practically perfect. You're a little slow, honey. Is it hurting again? If you re-injure it, we're finished. These bandages are loose. Here you go. We're playing high school students. Really good ones. We're so unlucky. When are we ever lucky? Don't get a stomachache again. We play right before you guys on the same court. It's the worst match-up ever. Why? Show them how far you've come! Right, Tamako? Welcome. Your dad said you'd be here. It's not a good time... I want your answer. About what? Tamako. It's between her and me. None of your business. Let's go outside. Stop it. Stay out of it! You know what you did to her? You're divorced, right? Stop it! Leave for now, Ejima. Please. And no come back! Sanitize with chili oil. OK! That guy is shameless. Hagi. You should tell him off so he never comes back. Hagi! I want to... ...give him another chance. Are you serious? We trained like crazy to beat him. Are you serious? You must be dreaming. They're both prodigies. Not some amateur and a has-been like me. A year of training is nothing in table tennis. You're... ...forfeiting? How about you? Your interview is Sunday. Are you going? I thought so. You looked so happy. You haven't moved on at all! Good thing you kept her ring! I'm just like you. I want to get married and be happy, too. That's my dream. I hate table tennis. Ever since I was young, I've always loved Ejima. And now he needs me. I know it's stupid. But I love him. OK. I'll go back to my wife and daughter. We both got what we wanted from the beginning. Everyone. Sorry. I'm grateful to you. Now I can play with my daughter. Good luck. Yuma. But... Without Hagiwara... If they don't compete... What about our club? It'll close! It's over. I'm...sorry. I would've done the same. Don't worry about us. We were able to dream. We had fun time play table tennis again. Too bad my spicy tofu. Hey, beanpole. Take this. - It's OK. - Just take it. Or I'll feel bad. Aren't you relieved? No more faking stomachaches. We'd lose anyways. Our dream was to compete in the Nationals. I know it was his dream, too. "To: Yuma Sasaki" "Graduation is unlikely due to absences and missing credits." So you're not competing. I guess you're beginning to understand that wives have roles to play. Yes. Do you know what the other wives are saying about you? You're an ex-delinquent. You dress too flashy. I know that. You'll never make Chief Internist because of me. I know that, too. That's a nice one. Look at this one. This one's perfect. But this one's nice, too. I like this one better. - This is the best. - Cool! - Right this way. - Thank you for waiting. Good evening. Please, relax. No, thank you. Why not? Just today. One drink. Welcome. Let me take your coat. Tama-chan! Tama-chan! My friend threw this party to wish us luck in the tournament. Eji! Yo, Mizu! Kasumi! Hello. My girlfriend, Tama-chan. - Nice to meet you. - Same here. Nice to meet you, Tama-chan. - See you later. - Bye. Excuse me. Cheers. I'm glad you came. I'm looking for a place for us. When can you move? We'll go furniture shopping. You're staying over, right? "National Table Tennis Tournament Kanagawa Prefecture Preliminaries" "I'm going. Yuma" "We took these on the sly. Sorry." Thanks for hiring me again. Good morning. Tamako. We decided to play. We came too far to give up now. "Round 2 of the mixed doubles matches will begin shortly." Let's kick some ass! If you really don't want to play, I'll get a stomachache instead. Let's do it. "Sagamihara High School, Seiya Higashi (Shakehand grip, backhand drive)" "Sagamihara High School, Iroha Tadokoro (Shakehand grip, forehand drive)" Everyone is playing table tennis for their own reasons.

Within the speed limit, of course. "Flower Table Tennis Club, Yuma Sasaki (Shakehand grip, chopper)" "Flower Table Tennis Club, Yayoi Yoshioka (Shakehand grip, chopper)" They're here!

If we lose, you'll be on the beat forever, Chief Yamashita! Yes, Sergeant Sato! Flower Table Tennis Club vs. Kanagawa Police Department. We won! Thank you. Good for them. They totally crushed them. I'm sorry. - But I... - It was close. You'll win next year. So I can... ...keep playing? Those shorts are a little short, though.
