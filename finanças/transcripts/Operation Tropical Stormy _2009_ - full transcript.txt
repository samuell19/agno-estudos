And: Świerszczyk69 WICKED PICTURES presents: ...a STORMY DANIELS special operation. AV-Subs Adult Videos subtitles: PRESENTS: OPERATION TROPICAL STORMY STARRING: - - WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY: STORMY DANIELS Two months after (accidently) saving the world and capturing evil terrorist leader Hussein,... ...George and his wife Rachel were promoted to official agent status. Just when life had returned to normal for the couple, they received some troubling news... Don't worry. Dr Harper is more-than-capable. I'm just so scared for George. Was this really necessary? Absolutely. Without a complete identity change, your husband's life was in grave danger. We received intel that after the capture of Hussein, and angered four terrorist factions, they put a price on his head. I understand. Yeah. It looks like he's almost done. Do you want to go in and take a peek? Yes. Sir? How much was it? What? The price on George's head? Ah. Four dollars. Four dollars? Four dollars? Oh! Excellent work, Doctor. That's quite a transformation. Yeah... this is incredible. Who is this anyway? Some famous porn star: Evan Stone. Agent Z was quite insistent on his new face. He also thought you'd appreciate... this. Oh! Holy shit. What is that? A penis implant. We had this special order, the extra huge size he requested. Look at the size of those testicles. Oh yeah... Yes...! A curious side-effect I'm afraid. After performing a facelift at this magnitude, we had so much extra skin... Frankly we didn't know where else to put it so... Hmmm. Oh no waste, he's finally got some balls. And he will be fully functional in about 3 days. Yes! Yeah, while you're at it, Doc, can you laser off those stupid tattoos? Sure. Easy enough. Woo. Three days. Three days. *Across the pond, British agents Jacks and Watson* *have safely returned to England where they continue* *to celebrate the success of their mission* *the way dashing British agents often do...* Just as we thought we were done for it, was to be the end of us, there was a loud crashing sound... BANG! Missile come bursting through the palace room, just missing us by inches. Do you have any idea how difficult is to operate a successful mission while dressing with this garments? What we was wearing is inconsequential Watson. I'd have to disagree, sir. It's quite difficult to outrun the hostiles in a skirt. Enough Watson. So there we were: Battling our way through the palace guards, heavily outnumbered. The bear in mind. We never expected to make it out alive, but still we battled on. We fought away for the flames and the falling debris. Until we caught up with the evil: terrorist Hussein. To save the world from impending doom. - And rescue the harem girls! - Quite. Now her Majesty the Queen has decided to, Mr. Jacks and I, with the... utmost honor. Yes, we ought to be knighted tomorrow morning. (Oooh...) Can you believe that, man? Sir Jacks. Sir Watson. Yes. Now, if you wouldn't... excuse us ladies. We need to get our rest for tomorrow ceremonies. - Slipper sir? - Thank you, Watson. Are you sure we can't stay just a bit longer? Perhaps we can help you relax before the big event. Yes, I've never made it with a knight before. Well technically we're not quite knight yet. Shut up! Watson! We certainly did rise to the occasion. George? It's after 7:00 you better be up. George? If you make me late on my first day as an agent, I'll kill you myself. [Whisper:] George? George? [A bit louder:] George? - [Loud:] George! - Ah! [*gunshot*] What the fuck is wrong with you? George, you almost killed me! Thought you were hostile. Hostile? I'll show you "hostile" if you don't get up. Idiot! What much (?) Yeah, back in the day I was... was quite the athlete. It's pole vaulting around the room, and... uh... After the sex, well that's when she actually knighted me. It was quite *** Agent Z? I got a mission for you. Go down and get me a cup of coffee. [*Laughs*] That just never gets old. Take these authorization forms down to the labs, we can finalize testing on formula 69. I will take that. Ever mean to have a little "chat" with Amy down in the lab. It's me to do it. No. You remember what happened last time we ventured down to her little den of iniquity? Stop thinking about it. *** you pig. It's gonna be a catfight. Where are you, Amy? You, little slut. Where are you? That's right. You better hide. You know who was gonna come down here and kick some ass. [*eeeew*] That's interesting. Hi! Oh. You're not Amy. No, uh, Amy's out in the field. She's collecting samples. She won't be back until next week. I'm her sister Martha. Where are your pants? Oh... I'm working at a top-secret project called "Formula 69". Formula 69? All right... You people are into some seriously kinky shit down here. Mm-hmm. Well you see we've managed to isolate a pheromone, that's only detectable to females. And also odorless and colorless. It induces extreme sexual arousal, and pleasurable endorphins when inhaled. Thus clouding the judgment of any female. And when mixed with any standard men's cologne, it becomes an invaluable tool to our male agents, to stracke and obtain information from would be females acids. Hmmm... hmm. God how you freaks the same. Mumbo jumbo. Well... Thank you for the... chemistry lesson there, Dr No-Pants. But I think I'll be going back upstairs, where the sane people work. [*spray*] Now you don't really think that that's gonna... [*Martha laughs nervously*] I... I... I didn't mean to actually... Cause I'm not really into... aah... So tell me... Do you think your wife is actually murdering Amy, or just beating her beyond recognition? Just a thought. [*women moanings*] Come on, come on... ah! Hmm... yeah. "You're my favourite fucking lab whore", tell me! You're my favourite fucking lab whore. Test formula complete. Subject reacted with optimal results. (Hmmm) Wow, I see she got to you too. Buckingham Palace - England I can't believe it, sir. I've got to pee again. I told you not to drink so much tea this morning. [*They're smelling something*] What's that god-awful stench? God, sir... I've stepped in dog poop. Oh my... [*steps*] Quick. Hmm-hmm. What should I do? Lose the shoes, man. - No! - Yes, quick, lose the shoes. Hurry up! In remembrance of those given and received, and for outstanding service to crown and the country, and on behalf of the Commowealth, I hereby dub thee Sir Marcus Jacks. You may rise. [*oooh*] Agent Z, agent D, there's an important satellite transmission for you in the control room. It's the President. (Hello?) Go ahead, Mr President. This is on? I don't get good reception in my office. Ah, agents Z and D. I'd like to congratulate you on the successful mission, and in capturing that really really bad guy... ... Who's that dude's named, Dick? ...and in capturing that really really bad guy Hussein. I also want to thank you on behalf of the American public, because they would have been very sad to have been blown up. It was our pleasure, sir. As a personal gesture, I would like to grant you to the use of my really big boat. And it's a fancy one too, to celebrate your anniversary. Oh my God! Thank you Mr President. Sir. Look at that, Dick, now that's what I call a missile. [*flsuhing the toilets*] [*fart*] Oh my God, do you believe it? I'm going on a cruise... ... on the president's boat! Oh my God. This is so awesome! Oh my God! I never get to go anywhere... [*indistinct chat*] - What? - Who are they? Well, since you're an agent now, X is auditioning new assistants. He's replacing me? Uh, pff.. This is a top secret mission, of the utmost importance. I need for you to take this phone, and answer it whenever I call. If you don't I could be killed. Do you understand? He's replacing me. - Hmm. - Hmm. Okay, okay, okay. Do you understand? - Understand what? - [*she laughs*] What was the question again? (Okay) You're perfect. You're hired. - Me? - Me? No, me! No, me! He's talking about me, okay? - Me! - Me! Hep Hep! Okay, both of you. You're both hired. Stop it. Stop it! [*indistinct chat*] So... You guys are Agent X new administrative assistants, huh? No, silly, we're secretaries! Unbelievable. ***? It could have happened to anyone. But it didn't happen to anyone. It happened to me. I must have keep *** like that. Sir Jacks. Sir Jacks, at your service. Look on the bright side, it's not every day you get into the Queen's knickers, no? Is it? Actually she wasn't wearing any, was she? Come on Tea Biscuit, let's go slay some dragons. [*Mission Impossible theme*] (Agent Jacks, agent Watson,) (do you read? This is agent Q, please respond.) This is Watson. (We ave just received a coded transmission) (Seems that North Korean leader Jong-Il has ***) (large quantites of unknown substance,) (for use in a weapon.) *** (We are not sure.) (But the message allude to an impending large-scale attack.) (We attract a vessel transport one of the ships) (***) (Proceed immediately to *** air force base.) (your transport is already in route and) (intelligence waiting to further review) (with ***) (This message will self-destruct in... 5...) (4... 3... 2...) (1...) [*BANG*] I hate when they do that. That's the fourth one this week. And I wanted some toast tonight. Now, the mirror on the wall, who's the sexiest of them all? [*beep*] Many pardons, Supreme Commander Sir, the *** is here to see you. Oh... have a wait in my office. I'm so sexy. She not resist me this time. Ah... Jung-Ho... What a pleasure. Sorry for the interruption, Commander, I was sent to informing that Dr Kwan has arrived safely, and is now working on your formula. He's guaranteed me he'll have results shortly. Excellent. Wacky americans keep searching for nuclear weapons. They will never suspect this. I so smart! I genius! Genius! Tell Dr Kwan he has exactly 24 hours. General So-Hung will be joining you to oversee completion of the attack. Oh, Yung-Ho? Shall we make with the sex? Yung-Ho? Oh... You play hard-to-get? Alrighty! I've been stretching. [*ouch*] Yung-Ho? Yung-Ho? From now on... ...you're gonna be known as agents... ... "T"... ... and "A". You know it is a terrible thing, though, to think that you may not come back from one of these missions. [*ooooh*] I'm sorry... I'm okay though. 'Cause it's just something that I, CIA agents, have to put up with, you know. Wear it like a badge of honor Still the... thought of never... ...have a look or touch you again... I'm alright... (No no, we can like that, eternally...) No... (No... we can...) Ouch, hold it! Okay, okay... Ladies, there is enough of agent X... ...to pull around. (yeah...) ...and... listen... if you're gonna be a team... We're gonna see how you... You know... work to... together. [*Jaws theme*] [*Laughs*] [*Laughs*] Ah! [*gunshot*] The supreme commander will not be pleased with another failure. I'm close. I'm close. I just need more time. You are almost out of time, doctor. *Somewhere at sea on the President's really, really big boat.* ♪ Oh I'm the captain of the captain of the captain of the ship. ♪ ♪ I'm the captain of the biggest ship that ever sailed the sea ♪ ♪ I'm the captain of the captain of the ship of the sea ♪ ♪ of the sea ♪ - Wow... - Happy and rich It's beautiful...

I think I'm gonna go have a nap before dinner. All right. - You *** up - Indeed. Now what are you gonna do with that? - This? - That. That's dangerous seas. You got to be careful. There's pirates around. I'm not afraid of pirates. Now they're *** when I got this baby. It's the last of them. So... How is it going? Well, I'm using satellite imaging to look for a bunker or warehouse, but I can't find any sort of structures. Especially nothing large enough to store weapons. Well... Keep searching old chap. Sir Jacks is gonna take a good nap. Sir Jacks can kiss my ass. [*beep beep*] This better be good. The Supreme Commander does not like to be interrupted during his mani-pedi. The tests have been successful. The formula is now complete. Yung-Ho, have you called to reconsider my offer to make the sweet love? Hello? Hello? Hello?

You've just sunk the President's yacht. How exactly one sink a yacht anyway? I felt asleep. Down my rocket launcher. Ah-ah... Pool! You and that fucking rocket launcher. What I don't get is how the doctors were able to fix your tiny crooked little dick, but they couldn't do anything for your pea brain. Yeah. That's right. You have to be the stupidest person alive. Actually wait a minute... no... That would be me, because, I married your dumb ass. But... But, you are, definitely, the worst secret agent in History. You take that back. No. You take that back Rachel. Nope. Fuck you George. Grrrrrr... I hate you! I hate you more. Damn... I hate you forever. At eternity... Time 20! I should have let you drown. That's coming from a guy in water wings. You can't even swim, George. Fucking idiot. Ubelievable. There goes my raise. I'm still not sure how you intend to get the American public to just poison themselves. Uh. That's how: There's one thing... no redneck can resist... (This weekend...) they're gonna have their silly 4th of July. They'll enjoy their last hotdog cookout! Ha-ha-ha Genius. I know. I am So-Hung. An honor. I mean, I heard. I mean, I read. Nevermind. Ah! You said you'd call. You said you'd go to anger management. Obviously you didn't. Oh! He'll be back... He'll be back. George always comes back. What if he doesn't come back? Oh god what if he doesn't come back... [*crying*] How I'm gonna spend the night? I don't know how to put a tent together. Oh god... Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god... [*man screaming*] Here we go. Here we go. Big jungle, big jungle. Survival. Survival is important. In a jungle, one can survive if we have food, if we have some water. Water. [*crying*] I'm so thirsty. I'm so thirsty... Maybe someone copy... Copy, be nice... Hey, you must be the jungle to survive the jungle. [*he makes monkey sounds*] I'm never gonna get out of here alive...

[*machinegun shots*] [*gunshots*] [*hmmm!*] Jax Rachel what what are you doing here - Jacks? - Rachel? - Watson? - What are you doing here? Are you on the mission? Yeah... [whispering:] What mission? I don't know, he doesn't tell me anything. Oh... Okay, I think it's clear. Let's move. Quick. Let's move. You, uh, do likely be needing these. Thanks. So... You're really Sir Jacks now, huh? I can't believe you guys got knighted. Oh... hum... Well, one of us did, but things didn't go quite as planned for Watson. Really? What happened? I don't want to talk about it, okay? Sir *** keep rubbing it in my face. (Don't be so sensitive, man) Let's just brief Rachel now, would you? Well, as you know, this island is the smallest of the group belonging to North Korean leader, Jong-Il. Now a British intel has informed us that he has hidden some sort of weapon here in preparing for attack. We've been using satelite imagery to scan the terrain for any photographic element of anything man-made existing out here. So we began searching the island on for 2 days ago, thinking perhaps Jong-Il had stashed the weapons in a cave. But so far, we've had no luck. Hmmm. Have you guys consider the possibility that maybe it's underground? - No... - [*Jacks toughs*] Um, I mean, yes. Here. I'll hack into one of the US heat-seeking satellite, reposition it to scan this island, see what we can find. Wow... You really did the.. on your top secret clearance now, didn't you? Could you doubt me, sir Jacks? Never again, my dear. Never again. Look, it's working... Goog god. It's been been right beneath us the whole time. It appears to be about a *** of us. - Oh my god. - What? We have to tell George. George? George, yes! Where is he, old chap? Oh, nice! Very nice. Look at these statues. Very nice. Wonderful place. Ouch, ah. Oh that was painful. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, but I could have walked. There was a woo... Ouh! Oh, hey, woo... Time out! Time out. Hold on. Time out. Time out. Woo, secret wedding ring. I know it's means something to some people but to other people it means nothing, but to me I love Rachel. Whoa. Rachel? Rachel? Loving Rachel. Loving Rachel. Whoa. Something else is up beside Rachel. Hello? Okay, wow, let's skip it... Stop it. Stop it, I'm getting wood. Woah, getting wood... Okay, okay. Just a little bit. All right, just a little bit. Okay, okay, okay, all right? I wouldn't want to be rude. One of the security details found an intruder on the beach. Oh, would they eliminated? She escaped. Son of bitch. Shit. Have my men *** [*roar*] - What is that? - What is that? George? [*roar*] Don't... move. Slowly guys. Slowly. - [*roar*] - Move! Sir Jacks! Shoot that! Rachel I'm coming. Oh my god. Rachel? What the...? Agent Jacks? Meet my new friend. Rachel, how? Top secret pheromone spray. Formula 69. Females find it irresistible. Obviously the species is not a factor. I'd say. - Can I have it? - No. Oh... Why? - Sir? - What are you doing? It's no time for siesta Watson. Come on get up! (What happened?) You fainted. That's what happened. Fainted? Yes, I told you once, now I told you twice. That's one crafty bird. Come on! Quickly... That's one crafty bird, Watson. I don't get it... Where could he be? He could be anywhere. It's George. He couldn't have gone that far. - Who knows? - Have you see the shape he's in? *** Look! This is his floaty. He couldn't have gone far. - Sir? - You thought what I think it is? Cannibals. Cannibals? There's cannibals here? What does that mean for George? What... - Sorry... - What does that mean? - I'm sorry Rachel. - Sorry Rachel. No... George! He's... He doesn't hurt ***. Come on. Why there's someone who wanna eat George? Number one: buy new platform shoes. Check. Number two: update my my-appraised(?) page. Yeah, check. Number three: blew something up. [*explosion*] He-he. Check. Number four: father more illegitimate children... About to be checked... Yung-Ho. I need you consider my offer. We can make beautiful evil offspring together. Intruders were discovered in the island, Commander. Would don't just stand there, looking cute, with your dragon face in your big cans. Go get them and destroy them. Oh wait... Tell me s sexy thing. Rachel, I'm sure he knew how you really felt. That's what I'm afraid of... You see, the last time I saw George, I hit him with my shoe... To George. A gentleman spy. And a great soldier. Well... sort of. Rachel, many comrades fall in *** It is the nature of our business. But George died saving his country. You should be very proud. Hmm, you're cute. You sound like that little insurance lizard on the TV. Huh? - We should make out. - What? Oh, I do love a natural woman. Nazi tiger... What you... What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? You touching my leg! P-Put your leg there. Wh... What about you, sir? What? - Sir! Don't... Don't move! (- What are you...?) (What is it?) What is it? What is it? Is it yours? No. Don't *** it over here, you freak. Guys... I think somebody's out there. How do know? I don't know... I just... I don't know, I can sense it. - Oh, you can sense it, can you? - Hmm-mm I think my highly-trained instinct would have alerted me to anything is going on out there. I think she my be right, sir. How'd you know that? Oh shit! Get out! [*gunshots*] Look, I got the big gun now. Sorry... I'll be over here. Good job, Watson! Yes sir. Thank you sir. I'll be over here, sir. (Everything is alright now?) We better git it ready. There could be more coming. Come on. Wait wait wait. What's that sound? Cannibals. It's the sound of the sacrificial drums. Sacrifice... oh! You don't think... George? Could it be? [*tribal song*] What a minute... That's not George. Looks like that porno chap. Yes, it does. What's his name? Evan Stone, sir. Well... That might look like Evan Stone, but that's my George. New and improved. And all the right spots on ***. How are we gonna save him? Hmm... Well, sir Jacks, what's your great instincts tell you now? We're gonna need a distraction. What kind of distraction? There's so many of them... I think I have just the thing. [*they quietly laughs*] [*pssssst*] Ah! Rachel, what are you doing here? I'm rescuing you. Now come on, let's go. Rescue... I don't need your rescue. Not from someone like you. These. These are my people and they, they love me, unlike you. Right... Well, your people, are going to eat you. Yeah, somebody is jealous. No, you jackass. Look around. They're going to eat you. They're cannibals. Yeah... they're going to eat me... hehe. Cannibals. Ah! Be quiet. ladies oh come on what he's good enough - Ladies! - Ahhh!!! Oh come on! What? He's good enough to eat and I'm not? What a bloody hell with you? I think we should get out of here before they come back. Yes, good idea. Oh, George, have you heard? I'm sir Jacks now. Hey! Does anybody see Watson? Okay, I think we should split up. Watson and I will head to the mainland and take out Jong-Il. Rachel, George, you stay here look for the underground bunker. From the satellite images, *** is beneath us. Entrance has to be around here somewhere. Now buddies, *** To meet again. - You are fantastic. - Thanks. What the hell did he mean by that? What? I mean: what the hell did he mean by that? "You are fantastic." Don't start with me George. I know what the cannibals do to people before they eat them. That's right. I watch the Discovery Channel. "I know what cannibal do before they eat." Don't worry: I watch the Discovery Channel. (George? Now!) I don't get it. Jacks said the hatch is here. Can't find it. Are you looking in the right place? I don't think Jacks knows always what Jacks is talking about. Oh really? And you do? Let me get this straight: You, who sank the President's yacht, got us stranded on an island, stranded on an island almost got almost got yourself eaten by cannibals. Wow. Why would I think you know how to find it? Oh my god, honey! You found it! - I found what? - The hatch! Oh yeah! I found the hatch. You dipshit. - Look! - What? Ahhh!!! Oh, the hatch! Open it. Yeah, all right. Not like that! Try the handle. (A little help here?) After you, sir. Down there? - Down there. - Down there? Down there. - Down there... - Down there. What? Watch it: Just if we don't make it out, I want to tell you I'm sorry I said I hated you. I don't hate you. I'm sorry too, I'm sorry about everything, I'm sorry about... ruining our anniversary, I'm sorry. You didn't write that. And hey, this is memorable, right? Right. I think I see something up ahead. What are you doing? I'm gonna call headquarters. They have no idea where we are... ...or what's going on. - What's wrong? - It's weird... ...no response. Oh shit, the CSV has call for distress, localise-it! What is all this stuff anyway? Barbecue sauce. That's kind of weird. George get down! The *** of a poison has been mixed into the sauce. All the bottles are packaged, ready to be shipped. (The Supreme Commander shall reward you for your dedication to the cause.) By this time tomorrow, these bottles will be on their way to every American grocery store. [Laughter] Not if I can help it! Ah! I can *** it for you. Go ahead. Make my day. Have you just disarmed me and hit me the nose at the same time? All right... See what you got, how quick you are, uh. Not bad at all. Now I have to know *** Now I've seen your Shaolin, *** Join in.

Shhhh. Let's go. (Sorry sir!) - You hear that? - This way. You go ahead. I have an idea. I won't betray my country! Nothing. Nothing. There are other ways. Many ways. To make you talk. No... No... No... Stop... [Laughter] Stop! Stop! I'll tell everything! Watson! Don't do it, man! Get all yourself! And after my parents divorced, I... went to live in the English countryside with my Nana. She made the most *** and a *** that I would have died for. About auntie Gertrude, she made some amazing *** [*gunshots*] George! Good George old chap! Thanks for your help, George.

Yes! My first kill. Rachel! Well done my dear. Thank you. Now it looks like the mission is complete. He's dead. Where's Watson? Don't ask. Who cares?
