Life is made of many maybes. Maybe it'll rain. Maybe your flight will be delayed. Maybe that encounter will be the first and only one. Or maybe that goodbye isn't the end, but a beginning. Maybe there is such a thing as soulmates. Or maybe love is just a complicated way of finding meaning to life. With every chance of going wrong. Among so many maybes, I've always had two certainties: I still haven't found the love of my life, and if I were ever to catch a flight, I'd arrive at the airport in good time. Well, maybe I was wrong. MAYBE A LOVE STORY A WEEK EARLIER TO-DO LIST Good morning. - Ms. Eunice! - Hi, Virgilio! Thank you. - How are you? - I'm great. Don't forget! Tonight's rummy session! We're a team, after all. - Have a nice day. - You too. Virgílio? Do you remember that yogurt slogan? "Strained yogurt is light. Your..." "Your well-being is our top priority." - That's perfect! Thanks. - You're welcome. Hey! You're always way too early. Well, I got the best seat, set the air conditioner temperature, - and decided on the best fire exits. - Fire exits? In case of a fire, or that your layouts are too boring. So, what's the plan? Here's the plan: I'll present the campaign my way. You know, creatively, charismatically... What is it? What? Is there anything wrong? Tell me. Could you move it... just a tad to the left? - Sure. - Just a tad. There. Everything ready? We're talking about the best-selling magazines, prime time TV... May I, Mr. Otávio? I must remind you that "Assenza" isn't just a fragrance, it's a lifestyle. I want something that people will never forget. Like a love story. I didn't come all the way from Europe to have ads in tabloids and soap opera commercials. I could arrange that over the phone. Of course! We could also put up billboards and... I've heard enough! We're leaving. We have clearly overestimated you... Excuse me, I think we have the creative solution for Assenza. Let's give them another shot. Make it brief. We are one of the world's top advertising agencies. We can spread your name throughout the state of São Paulo overnight. Buenos Aires, Sydney, New York... Imagine having your ad debuting at the same time all over Times Square. "Assenza. The fragrance of love without the shortcomings." - Was that your idea? - Yes. If your perfume offered love without all of its shortcomings, I'd have bought it a long time ago. - To success! - To success! Promoted? You really nailed it. Got us another million-dollar project. - Simone... - You've been at this job for a long time. You deserve a new room, a new environment. A new position. I don't want it. You don't want to be promoted? - I'm flattered, but no. - I don't think you understand. A promotion means a raise. Please. You already pay me so well. My income tax return also hasn't changed for years. I even use the same form. The date is different, of course. I have forms ready all the way to 2025. You know? More money would only mess up this system, and it's been working really well. Plus, I'm a bachelor, my life is very neatly organized. Give Otávio that promotion. He's so efficient, he has a family, his kids want to go to Disney World... Either way, thank you very much, Simone. Thank you, Simone. You have one new message. First new message. Virgílio? It's Clara. Sorry for saying this via answering machine, but I think we should break up. I've never loved anyone as much as I love you, but I can't do this anymore. That's all, Virgílio. Goodbye. Virgílio? It's Clara. Sorry for saying this via answering machine, but I think we should break up. I've never loved anyone as much... as I love you, but I can't do this anymore. That's all, Virgílio. Goodbye. Virgílio? It's Clara. Thank you. Virgílio! Where were you last night? I had to team up with Beth. Sorry, Ms. Eunice. I forgot. I'm in a bit of a hurry now. We can play next week. Virgílio, are you OK? - Yeah... I'll talk to you later. Thanks! - OK. Bye-bye. It's an emergency. Virgílio? It's Clara. Sorry for saying this via answering machine, but I think we should break up. I've never loved anyone as much as I love you, but I can't do this anymore. That's all, Virgílio. Goodbye. So, this woman broke up with you? Yes. No. I mean, not exactly. You may not accept it, but she was crystal clear. That's the thing: I don't even know her. So, she dialed the wrong number. But she said my name. You're not quite a "John," but there are many Virgílios in this country. Could it have been a prank call? Why would a woman you don't even know prank call you? I dunno, maybe she... - Sorry. I have to take this. - Sure. Otávio, I can't talk now. What? Right, I'll call you later. Bye. Otávio just asked me if I was alright after Clara broke up with me. Is there any trace of her in your cell phone? No. Not like this one had a lot of memory, anyway. Are you sure you've never met this Clara? I am! Of course I am. You'd know. I'd have told you if I knew some Clara. Have I ever told you I was in a relationship? You hide a lot of things, Virgílio. Clara wouldn't be the first. And you haven't been to an appointment in months. So why don't you simply delete the message, and pretend this never happened? Because... Because... Because you're not 100% sure it didn't happen, correct? Have you by any chance fallen or fainted recently? - Any head injury that might have... - Caused head trauma? No. Not as far as I know... No, definitely not. Even if I did, I can't hit my head and forget just one person. That's insane, right, Marcia? What are you writing down? - A prescription for a cranial CT scan. - I haven't hit my head. Either way, it was a shock. Thanks. Don't worry. "Don't worry" is one of the most worrisome sentences there are. You know that one of us isn't going to get good news, right? That's how the universe goes. Lightning only strikes one person at a time. If your prognosis is good, mine will be a death sentence. Mr. Antônio Pedroso? Jesus Christ... Time to see which of us will get hit by lightning. Your exam is just fine. You're free to go. In your face, Death! Go screw someone else over, you bastard! I got away! Take that, Grim Reaper! Mr. Virgílio Seles? Mr. Virgílio? Good afternoon. I'd like to disconnect my electricity. Can I ask you why, sir? - I have a terminal illness. - That's awful. It isn't easy. Your power will be disconnected in a couple of days. Thank you. Well, I don't have much time left, so I'll have to hang up. I still have to cancel the water and gas services, and magazine subscriptions. I don't want to be billed after I die. May I help you with anything else? I hope I was a good customer. Have a good afternoon. You too. - Virgílio! - Hey, Otávio. Are you OK? I think I'm dying, Otávio. Of course you are. How did you already know? I thought I was dying too, remember? When Marcela, from costumer services... That bitch! That bitch... The bitch who broke up with me. I went 12 days without showering and eating nothing but pizza, practically living on my couch... But now I'm over her! Everything's fine. It's all behind me. That's how life goes. - Guess what? - What? You're talking to our new creative director! Oh, right! Congrats. I have a room all to myself! Nameplate and everything! - Don't be upset that they chose me... - I'm happy for you. - Promise? - I really am. Now that I'm top dog here, I won't leave you behind. We'll promote you in no time. Get you out of that shared workstation? - Right? - Right, sure. - Thank you. - No problem... But, say, how did you hear about Clara? On Facebook. We have a mutual friend. It showed that Clara had changed her relationship status to "single." This "Facebook" has pictures, right? - Yes. - Any pictures of Clara? No. She deleted her account. You know women, right? They go crazy after they break up. Delete their accounts, cut their hair, buy purses, and move on with life. That's rough, bro. I'd never seen you so happy with a chick before. - But I'll be on the lookout. - Alright. Thanks. Why don't you take a day off? - I can't. I have stuff to do. - I can handle things. I'm serious. I'm here for you. Don't worry. Whoa! Hey. There, there. - Thanks. And congratulations. - No worries. You're part of this. I'm not dying anymore! I did some research. You may have blocked her out of your memory due to the shock of the break-up. "Lacunar amnesia." Forgetting a specific part of your memory. It's uncommon, but it's possible. Great. If my memory was a pizza, it'd come without a slice, is that it? What are you... Last time you were here, you talked about a party. - I went to a party? - And didn't realize some pineapple juice was actually Piña Colada. You drank more than you should and couldn't remember it too well, but a friend introduced you to someone. In your own words, "a remarkable woman." Clara? You didn't say her name, but you did say who introduced you two: - Carolina. - Carolina! I remember a little. Carolina called me... "Come here, Virgílio, I have to introduce you to..." "Clara." Was that it? Yeah... That's all I can remember. The only way for you to know why you forgot her is by remembering her. Could you just, for once, say clearly what you mean? You won't get your memory back unless you find Clara. You'll remain an amnesiac until you do that. But how can I find her? I don't even know her. I don't know anyone by that name. There are no pictures, not a single hair of anyone in my house other than mine. I don't know where to start. Maybe that's a good start. Now, the tree pose. Feet parallel to each other, grab them with your hands... That's right. Deep breaths, and now raise your hands. Legs down. Arms down... Today's class will end a few minutes earlier. Thank you very much for coming. "Namaste." - Hi. - I almost thought you had died on me! - I wasn't so sure until this morning. - What? Never mind. Say, Carol... I have to tell you something. I think I'm going crazy. Like, for real. I've lost part of my memory. I'm serious! I forget important people, events, experiences, feelings... many of them. That's totally normal! - There's something wrong with me. - No, there isn't. - The thing is: you were dumped. - How did you hear about it? Everybody knows it! I was the one who introduced you two... Yes! You were the one who introduced us! Of course! Have you forgotten? I have! Well, kind of. See? I'm going crazy. You're not going crazy. You're just hurt. You're trying to forget someone. Does that sound familiar? You mean that happens to everybody? - It happened to me. - When? When we broke up. You completely forgot it? Erased me from your memory? That would have been a lot easier. At the time, I was pissed. But then I realized it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I finally went to India! It's something you'd never do. Or did you change your "anti-vacation" ways? Not much, no. - That's great! - Good for you. It was good seeing you again, Virgílio, but my next class is coming up. - Bye. - Sure, of course. Wait, Carol! One more thing. That night, at the party... Could you tell me more about Clara? Where does she live? What does she do? - I don't know, Virgílio. - What do you mean? I don't know her that well. I only introduced you because you two were uncomfortable at my party. Try Melissa. I guess she was the one who brought Clara there. - Bye. - Bye. Melissa, Melissa... Thank you. I'll go get your change. Vanilla éclair, double frosting. The usual. My favorite. Thanks. You look good. You look great, too. This is wonderful. How was your trip to Rio? It was great. Lots of work, too. It's my second shop there. I'll open a new one here next month. - I hope you can come. - Sure. The two of you. How are you and Clara doing? You two are such a cute couple. I knew from the start you'd be great together. I could see something special in the making even back then, I just knew you two would click. Carol's party was unforgettable, huh? Unforgettable. Partially unforgettable, anyway... I remember like it was yesterday. A month after the party, you came here and told me you'd found the love of your life. - What's wrong? - It's nothing. I'm great. Everything's great. The éclair is great. In fact, you are so right, Melissa. We're doing great. Clara and I. Couldn't be better. By the way, I want to buy her a gift... - I was thinking about... - How about a box of éclairs? "An éclair for Clara"... Makes for a good slogan! Evandro! Get me a box of éclairs, would you? Do you guys do delivery? Not yet, but our next shop will. That's fine. Could you give me Clara's address? Don't you know it? Do I? I should think so. Asking you for my own girlfriend's address! That's crazy. But I lost it. My memory, I mean. - What? - My memory card. - Oh, your phone's. - That's it. You know, I can't store everything in my head, so... - Did you like it? - It's delicious. Thanks. It's on the house. Bring Clara with you next time. I want to get to know her better. I even asked Denise for her number, but I guess she forgot. Denise... Are the two of them friends? Best friends. It was Denise who took her to the party. Awesome! Thanks, Melissa. That's great. - Thank you! Congrats! - Bye, see ya! "Your call is being forwarded to an automatic voice message system." Hey, Denise. Can we have coffee tomorrow morning? Oh, no! Damn it. Yes, the resident asked you to cut off the water supply since he thought he was dying, but he's not, and does not intend to do so. So, turn it back on. I'm sorry, sir. You'll need to present us with a medical certificate in person. Proving I was dead, on the other hand, required nothing. Ms. Eunice? Is everything OK in there? It isn't even 10p.m. yet! Go to hell! Ms. Eunice? Listen here, I'm no... Are we having a costume party at the building? - Where's Ms. Eunice? - Off on a trip with her friends. - And you are...? - Virgílio. Her neighbor. Oh, my grandmother did tell me about you. She said you're worse than Beth. And this is Frank. Frank! Hush, boy! Down, Frank! That's right. He loves Frank Sinatra. Nice to meet you. I'm Kate. I'm Virgílio. Her neigh... I've said that already. My water was cut off. Could you lend me some? Just a minute. C'mere, boy! Here. Thank you. Nice meeting you, Virgílio, the neighbor. Nice to meet you too. Thank you for coming. The kids' school is close by. It's practical. - How's your family? - We're doing fantastic! Guilherme is simply amazing. Having a family is the best. Sorry, that was thoughtless of me. I've heard about you and Clara. Carolina told me... - Yeah. - Things fell apart, huh? How are you coping? Me? I'm taking it one day at a time. Denise, you were the one who took Clara to Carol's party, right? Me? Of course not! I'd never want a friend of mine dating you. If I can't have my cake, no one else can. You're too kind. But if it wasn't you, then who was it? Fernanda. Fernanda? So I'll go talk to her. Virgílio, did you get amnesia? I don't know. I can't remember. Fernanda is absurdly popular with men. And she was super into you. So, she goes to the party with her best friend and what do you two do? Just a second. My husband's arrived. I gotta go. Virgílio, you'll be a wonderful husband. Someday. I guarantee it. - It was nice seeing you. - Ditto. Hang in there. Welcome back, pumpkin! Hi, darling. How are you doing? Hey, baby! How are you? Let's go? So... I miss her. You miss a woman you can't even remember? You know... The greatest revelation... Actually, the only revelation I got from all the women I've met so far, is that somehow I had the chance to be with them, but I chose not to. Or maybe you were too afraid to fall in love with them as well. Why would I be afraid to fall in love? Because you're a control freak? And falling for someone means losing control of your own life. We end up depending on the other person to laugh, to have fun, to breathe. That sounds really bad. They've changed, you haven't. Changing isn't necessarily a bad thing, Virgílio. Just another thing. I need a doctor's certificate saying that I'm not dead. So they can reconnect the water supply at home. Don't even ask. I think there's one last girl for you to inquire about Clara. Fernanda... You look amazing. Have you lost weight? So, where does Clara live? Virgílio. Fernanda. Virgílio, I'm a little short on time. What did you want to ask me? It'll only take a second. Tell me... - Just a sec. - Sure. Would you like some wine? I'm good. Maybe... Clara. - You might've heard that we... - That she dumped you. Yes. The two of you were friends, right? I want to know why she broke up with me. Well, that's for you to find out. Sorry, I'm running late. Fernanda! Sorry... I'm sorry. Just a minute. I'm sorry about the other night. I'm sorry I... Virgílio, there's no need for you to apologize. You and Clara together was the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'm glad to hear it. Now I'm living something I've never lived before with João. João? - Clara's brother. - Of course. We're dating right now. You're dating João, Clara's brother? He's so mature, even if the kids' books he writes don't show it. - But... - Why don't you go talk to her? I'd love to, but I lost her info. Do you know her phone number? You should talk to her in person. Clara's the manager. She's probably there now. Go on. I'll go there now. How long will it take me to get to Clara's work? If I leave now. You know, traffic is so... The São Paulo Museum of Art is like three blocks away. - The MASP! - Yeah. She's the MASP's manager. MASP is a museum... Go, Virgílio. Clara's amazing. Everything will be fine. Clara? Hi. I think we need to talk about our break-up. Virgílio, I know. Clara had a picture of you on her desk. Nice to meet you. I'm Lisa. Lisa! Hi, I'm so sorry. I'm a little... I'm confused... - Is she here? - She doesn't work here anymore. Didn't you see her? She just left. There she is. RBA-2609. RBA-2609... RBA-2609... Hey Virgílio, what're you up to? I've just seen a vehicle that would be perfect for a marketing campaign, and I wrote down the license plate. Could you use the agency's resources to get me the owner's contact info? Sure, you're the man. Send me the plate. Hello. Are you interested? How are you? I'm Luís, the landlord. Hi, nice to meet you. It's a very nice apartment. And the one who used to live here was such a perfectionist! What happened to her? She decided to move. Change the scenery, start a new life She was coming off a nasty break-up, you know how it is. Well, feel free to take a look around. The apartment is great, no noisy kids in the building, no dogs... We don't forbid dogs, but it's quiet without them. I'll be downstairs. Call me if you need anything. Thank you, Luís. - Hey, neighbor! How's it going? - Hey. I got a gig as a wedding DJ. Could you take care of him? It won't take long. It'll be only until the wedding dance. He's pretty docile, but if he starts barking, play track 1. - Track 1? - Thanks for the help! It's nothing, but... Well, this is my place. Make yourself at home. Here's your Frank Sinatra. It really works. No! They've cut the power off. It isn't my fault. For goodness' sake... hush! Hello? My apartment's power was cut off. May I borrow a candle? - Sure. Come in. - Okay. Sorry for the mess. I'm still moving in. I understand. Are you going to move in with Ms. Eunice? At least until I start making it in one of my careers. As a DJ? Yeah, and acting. Oh, there's my brush. Actually I'm a costume designer, regular designer, choreographer... I'm into biology, too. I wanted to change the scenery. Leave some stuff behind. - Just a minute. - Sure. I can't seem to find those candles. Here they are! I'm using them to rehearse for a musical but I don't need them right now. Virgílio? It's Clara. Sorry for saying this via answering machine, but I think we should break up. I've never loved anyone as much as I love you, but I can't do this anymore. That's all, Virgílio. Goodbye. Virgílio? It's Clara. Sorry for saying this via answering machine... Where are you, Clara? Virgílio, this is the last time. Either you make an appointment, or wait for your turn like everyone else. What do you think this means? Is it a sign? A premonition? I don't know... What about a dream? Either way, she's revealing herself to you. I just want my life back, is that too much to ask? Easy, organized, right on track. Just that. Do you really feel like that? Are you sure? Virgílio, I think you should worry a little bit more about understanding why you forgot her, not why she did what she did. The real mystery lies in your amnesia. Not in Clara. In some cases of lacunar amnesia, getting back to your daily life can be a way to recover your memory. Your job, your home... What's going on? What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you all doing? Emptying the apartment. Who gave you permission? The owner. The man who lived here died. What? No! I'm here, I'm not dead! I'm not dead. I have a doctor's certificate to prove it. "On today's segment, a Neanderthal neighbor." What are his habits? How does he live without electricity and water? "Does he still feel hunger?" You probably think I'm crazy. No way! I think your story is beautiful. I'm dead serious. I'm moved! How is a story I can't remember "beautiful?" Precisely. - Well, I went there... - And? There was no one there, she had moved to God knows where... I'm starting to think that leaving things alone would be best. It seems to me that women feel a lot better when I leave them alone... I guess not. It's so hard to find a nice guy nowadays. It's so hard. Think about it. Half the guys out there are already taken. And half of the single guys are into guys, so they're not available. And out of that straight half, half of them are boring, weird guys that nobody wants to date. So, out of that non-gay, non-taken and non-boring half, there must be, like, 17 guys left. I think Clara knew how lucky she was to have found you. Even without remembering her, you care and worry about her. You know when you hear a song at a happy moment, and, after a while, you hear it again in another mood, but you feel the same way? That's it... When I hear her voice on that voice mail... If I forget the lyrics and focus on the melody alone... Deep down, I'm sure we were very close. See? Come on, Kate. It's past 10 p.m. already... I'll introduce you to Clara. You're gonna love her. Virgílio, this is Clara. Clara, Virgílio. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HONEY It opened. What's this? It's a video of your... Clara... Take your time. I really had to get going to that... Alright? Hang on. Tell me. How's your birthday been so far? Are you recording? Sure. I want to document such an important day! Right. Tell me! - It's been OK. - "It's been OK?" That's it? Are you sure? Want me to go there and bite you? Right. I woke up to breakfast in bed! And then we went to feed the ducks in the park. And now I'm here at my favorite record store! With my favorite person in the whole world. No, not that one. I listened to that my whole adolescence. You like heavy metal? No, my brother used to listen to it all day long. I hate it till this day! How can João write a book called "Clara and the Pink Elephants" - and listen to heavy metal? - But he does. Pretty loud. What about that one? What's wrong with it? Nothing. Come on. Tell me! My parents used to listen to this one. Before going on stage. On stage? Are they musicians? Artists. They worked with the circus. What do you mean? Your parents worked in a circus and you never told me? That's why you have so many circus posters at your place! I never talk about this with anyone. You're gonna talk with me, then! Tell me! What was it like? It was nice. But I spent my whole childhood moving from city to city. I'd move and change schools every month. We moved and everything changed. But they're great. They're gonna love you. - Stop recording, that's enough. - No... I'm the one who's gonna love them. - Send a kiss, say hello! - Kiss. Hello! They won't be able to watch this. They don't even have cellphones. I think you won't be able to see it on your phone either. - But I'll work something out. - I won't. Virgílio? I'm very happy with you, right here, like this. I don't wanna change anything. Nothing at all. This song... We gotta dance to it, Clara. Now. - Now? - Yeah, now. Drop your phone. - No more cellphone. - Fine! I'll do it! João! Good morning, I'm a representative for the WCP advertising agency. I need the contact information of one of your writers. It's for one of our campaigns. Of course. His name is "João Miller". - Can I help you? - Good afternoon. João? - Yes? - I'm Virgílio. I'm Clara's ex-boyfriend. Holy shit, Virgílio. How are you? I'm doing fine. You? - Me too. - May I have a word with you? I've read your books. I really liked them. Glad to hear it. - Do you have children? - No. I don't like kids. Never did. Well, just don't put that on your blog. Have a seat. Clara moved away, right? She's moving away to a new city. She got her dream job. It's no small feat, either. Associate curator at the Guggenheim! New York? She'll be leaving tonight. She got this tiny apartment but it has a wonderful view of Times Square. I thought she had mentioned it. Yeah, she might have. I never saw the two of you together, you and Clara... But I know my sister well. And based on what she told me about you, it really is a shame it didn't work out. João... I need to talk to her. I don't know... Maybe... I don't know about you, Virgílio, but I think love has many forms. One of them is care, protection... Not letting the other suffer anymore. You know? Letting them be happy. Clara deserves to be happy, right? Just a minute. Hey, Fernanda. You OK? The lasagna is already in the oven. I'll be waiting. See you soon. Sorry, I have a dinner date with my girlfriend. - Otherwise, I would invite you... - Don't be silly. João, I lost my contacts. Could you give me Clara's phone number? Let's try this, you give me yours and I'll send it to her. She'll get in touch if she wants to. - I really need to talk to her. - Sure. I'll give it to her. OK? Thank you. Virgílio! Two conditions: you can't tell her it was me, and you won't flood her with calls and messages. Clara's phone number. One message, one call. She'll call you back if she wants to. The answering service is full. Please try again later. The answering service is full. Please try again later. American Air Lines, good afternoon. Just a minute, sir. I'll check in the system. That's the proposal. We'll be working with two different sizes since there are always the gluttons. Some think they can handle this size. It's fine. We'll start with the strawberry flavor, - we're going to release... - Yes, Clara Miller is booked for flight 305 to New York, tonight at 9:30 p.m. Thank you. To the airport. How long until we get there? Traffic jam. It's rush hour. The app says it's getting worse. I won't make it in time... I think we'll get there with no time to spare. I'M ALMOST AT THE AIRPORT. WAIT FOR ME. I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. ONE TEXT MESSAGE SENT TO CLARA CLARA 1 TEXT MESSAGE I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU ANYMORE. HAVE A NICE LIFE. CLARA. - Ms. Eunice! - Hi! How have you been? Calm down! Hey! Cards tonight? I was just about to tell you Beth said she's in. Of course you're a much better player than her, but it'd be rude to... No, of course. I understand. - Is that OK? Bye! - Good to see you. Bye. Come on, now. The keyword here is "synergy." A campaign in which all means of communication converse. Television, magazines, social media... That's good, but it isn't "wow!" We want an unforgettable campaign. Anything to add, Virgílio? With all due respect, nothing is unforgettable. Especially advertising campaigns. You need more. I don't know... I mean, people forget. It's natural. We can even forget relationships. Other people. Like Clara. She sent me a single message and then vanished into the ether. It's like she never existed. She never existed. A genius brainstorming, gentlemen. Don't worry, we shall develop these concepts more thoroughly. And we'll launch a campaign that is... "Whoa!" OK? Is everything OK, Virgílio? Yes. Everything's in order. About that promotion... - I just thought of... - We should wait a little while. No, you don't get it. I'd like to take it. - New horizons might be good... - You're the one who didn't get it. Things have changed after today's meeting, and... How come? Don't you wanna take some time off? Virgílio? It's Clara. Sorry for saying this via answering machine, but I think we should break up. I've never loved anyone as much as I love you, but I can't do this anymore. That's all, Virgílio. Goodbye. Hm... So? I don't think you should delete the message. She's in New York now... This may be your last memory of her. Yeah, but it didn't work out. I don't know why, but it didn't. You need to talk to her. Call her, contact her. But she was crystal clear. Twice even. I don't think so. She left you this one voice message and answered a text message. Have you talked to her? Did you hear a "no" straight from her mouth? I'll call her from my phone, you talk to her, and then we'll destroy this rusty old answering machine. Hello? Hello? I think I know that voice. How? Did you "remember" she's married? No. Make something up! - Hello. - Hi, I'm Jéssica Aguiar, reporter, and I'd like to ask you a few questions. It won't take long. - My blog has all the information. - I see. Sure. - Am I talking to Mr. João... Miller? - Yes, that's me. - João Miller, is that you? - Yes, go ahead. Is this cell phone yours? - Yes. Who else would it belong to? - And has it always been yours? Yes. We'll call you back later. Son of... It's his number. It has always been his number. Clara didn't get my message... She never got my message, Kate! Virgílio... You have to go after her. In New York? That's crazy! Crazy? Crazy is forgetting the most important person in your life. What if she is the woman of your life? Attention, passengers. This is your last call for flight 305 to New York. Now boarding at gate 22. What do you mean, New York? New York, as in, "New York City?" What are you doing there? You don't travel by plane! Do you? Yeah, Otávio. That isn't important right now. Are you going to help me? Virgílio, are you crazy? Trust me. Otávio, I've never really spent any money. Virgílio, listen... Fine. Alright, I'm game. I'll do it for you. How do you want to do this? Just tell me! CLARA, IT'S VIRGÍLIO I HEARD YOUR MESSAGE. WE HAVE TO TALK. I'LL BE WAITING AT THE TOP OF THE ROCK ONE NEW TEXT MESSAGE Clara. It's just so good to see you. I don't know what shocked me the most, the Times Square message or seeing you here. In New York. I missed you. I don't even know what to say. I was just going out to lunch, then all of a sudden... Are you hungry? We could go eat. And then? Then we could look for an apartment, maybe... Clara... My life is just the way I want it. I like my job, and you like yours. I like my apartment, and you like yours. It's such a huge opportunity for me. - For us. - I know. But it's not worth it. You don't understand. Of course it is. - That's why I'm asking you... - Clara, I can't. - You know I can't. - Of course you can. Things don't need to be the same all the time. - We could... - I don't want to. Congratulations on your job. Virgílio? It's Clara. Sorry for saying this via answering machine, but I think we should break up. I've never loved anyone as much as I love you, but I can't do this anymore. That's all, Virgílio. Goodbye. TO-DO LIST I wanted us to mean so much to each other to the point we could share the same dreams. But then I saw my dreams didn't have a place on your fridge list. What were you thinking all this time? I thought of looking for you, and... Finding out what happened. And? So that's it? Have a nice trip, Virgílio. Clara? Clara? - Wait! Wait! - That's enough, Virgílio! I have one last text message for you. Actually, it was the first text I sent you before you came here. Listen. "Hey, Clara." Everything... Everything in my life has been the same for the past 10 years. Same job, same desk, three pencils, 17 post-its and a notebook. The same routine, the same dinner. I've tried hard to keep it that way because I thought I'd be happy if things stayed the same. But I've realized over the past few months that it doesn't matter how much I try to keep things the same, it doesn't work. It doesn't work without you. "Call me when you get this text. Love, Virgílio." I won't let my fear stop me this time, Clara. Let's go? - Let's go, Clara? - Where to, Virgílio? I just moved here, I just got a new job... Let's go to China, to Australia, to Machu Picchu, wherever you want to go. I'll go with you. Screw my little to-do list on the fridge, screw worrying about what'll happen in the next two or ten years. I want to build every second with you, by your side. You're the only thing I want to keep the same in my life. The only thing. Virgílio? It's Clara. Sorry for saying this via answering machine, but could we meet at the park after your interview? Good luck, honey. Love you. Life's made of many maybes. And love is the greatest maybe of them all. Maybe it's forever, or maybe it'll go all wrong. But of one thing I'm sure: if I've ever questioned I should try, I just can't remember.
