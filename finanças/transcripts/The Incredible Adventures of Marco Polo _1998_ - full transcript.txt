In the year 1304, the wars between Genoa and Venice raged on. In the military prison in Genoa, captured soldiers would pass the hours telling stories of fierce battles and brave conquests. The scribe Rusticello imprisoned at the time recorded their words. One evening a ragged group of prisoners gathered around an older man to hear his story. It was a tale they would never forget. My name is Marco Polo of Venice. The city in which I was born and spent the early years of my life. My family thought Venice was the center of the world, to its markets came produce of many lands. Silks, precious metals but above all, spices. It is from here that my father journeyed forth when I was but a child to seek his fortune. It was a journey from which he would never return. From time to time we heard news of his adventures. Adventures that took him as far as the land of the great Khan, China. In the year 1271 in the month of June, I was summoned by my father's bankers to collect my inheritance, but when one has money there are those anxious to separate you from it. It is here that my journey begins. ♪♪ (indistinct chatter) Mister. Wow, thank you. Hey. What the? My money. I believe you have something of mine. (Crowd cheering) (crowd booing) (cheering) Now, I want my money back. Come on. (Crowd cheering) Well, you must be looking for this. Here. (cheering & whistling) (Applause) Thank you. (Applause & cheering) (Marco) My father had disappeared when I was very young but my uncle had seen a great deal of the world and of the places my father had no doubt visited. What stories he had to tell. We shared his adventures, myself and my young brother Nicolo. Dreaming of the day we too may visit these wondrous places, travel through dangerous lands and face great perils as we journey to the ends of the earth. Perhaps as far as China itself. Thus as soon as the chance presented itself, I was ready. My uncle was sending me on my first trade expedition abroad but I had other plans. However far I had to travel, I was resolved to find my father. Only young Nicolo guessed my plans. With the first steps that led me away from home, I began to look at everything differently because I suddenly realized that I may never see my birthplace or my family again but then something amazing happened and the wonders of my journey began even before I left my native Venice. (Kids screaming) Oh, my God. A monster! (Animal groaning) (man) All you're doing is spitting gung everywhere. No, I'm going to send you back. Now, will you stop your blabbering. Would you quit your squealing you flea-bitten foul-smellin' mucus-spitting long-legged walking butcher shop! You know, quit it while you're here! I heard of these creatures from Persia but I certainly never seen them in Venice. They are camels, are they not? They have been known as that amongst other things. Get away. They've been known to breathe fire at a moments notice especially when noisy little rats don't go, away, away, away. Excuse me sir. Do they carry much weight? They might do. Have you ever been to Aqrah? I might have been. Then how long did you plan to stay in Venice? Look, I'm trying to run a first class operation here. We transport first class merchandise of any important people to the four corners of the world. I have no time for small talk, you hear me? I have money to rent your first class operation. Captain Cornelius Donovan, former Knight Templar and owner of this mighty, mighty caravan you see here behind me. Tell me, did I hear you say that you had some money? You did indeed, shall we chat? I found myself fascinated by these strange creatures as well as the man who first brought them to Venice. And so I decided to travel by caravan. Now, Captain, you're sure this beast is safe? Will ya trust me? How long will it take to get to Aqrah? 40, maybe 50 days, depends. Depends on what? On the camels. Rather like my first wives, they've got temperaments which are shall we say unpredictable. Ah, that's very comforting. You do have the money, don't ya? Like I said half now and half when we get to Aqrah with me in one piece. Well then, we better get going soon. Come on now my privies, let's be off with this. (Camel grunting) Okay. Oh, oh, Captain... Captain! Whoa! (Crowd laughing) Captain. Come on stop your blabbering, come on now. Captain, Captain. Okay. Don't you worry about a thing there. And so I left my native Venice riding a camel in the company of one Captain Cornelius Donovan a former Templar Knight now turned caravan master. We followed trade routes the old rogue only vaguely remembered and that's when he was sober. I was never sure that we would actually make it to Aqrah but I hope that the promise of more money would get me there in one piece. I can't recall much about those first few days except the dryness in my throat and the soreness of my hind quarters. And with the endless schemes the Captain had for getting rich off his camels. To this day I can't decide which caused me more suffering. Just think of the money. I mean if we do this right we could have a whole bloody camel empire, you know that. (Chuckles) Captain, I already told you-- I know, I know, I know, your father and China but think of all the things you could buy with the money you make in bloody China. I suppose that's true. You know something, when I was a Templar Knight I met a trader who was traveling to the east and to tell you the truth, his looks and your looks are very, very similar. Did he tell you of his plans? No, no. He was an experienced traveler. The one thing you learn when you're trading in foreign countries, don't keep a loose tongue in your head. And being an experienced traveler myself I bet my last camel that he was on his way to Armenia. Then to Armenia it is. (Men clamoring) Jesus, Mary, what is this? What the hell is going on here? (man) This little rat has been stealing our rations. Found someone. What you doing, trying to steal from me? No. I have the mind to cut your throat you little rat. Take it easy there, Captain, I agree with you, he is a rat but this particular rat happens to be my brother. Your brother? Now, I like you Marco but I can't abide freeloaders. I run a very... I know, first class operation. I suppose we have to have another chat. That's right, another chat. A chat. He's just my brother, he's just a boy. Your transportation is being secured but first of all you have to promise to do what I say needs doing, you understand? A Polo never forgets the kindness of strangers. Well, that's a very good idea, young lad. First of all you have to pick up all this camel dong that's laying around here for the fires in the morning. You understand that now, young lad? Yeah. Good. Good. I told you, Marco, wherever you're going I'm coming with you. Well, we will talk about that in the morning. In the meantime I believe you have an appointment with some camel dong. Do as the Captain said. The Nubian slave who helped Nicolo with the first of his many unsavory tasks soon became his best friend and a surprisingly excellent teacher for the boy. For someone who had never been outside a city before, Nicolo adapted to the wilderness like he had been born there. My eager little brother readily absorbed everything the Nubian had to show him. And soon became proficient at a number of survival skills, but his favorite pastime was the sling shot and he would practice every chance he got. (Donovan) Oh, hey! That's your brother! After a while the novelty of riding with the caravan wore off and life on top of the camel became almost routine. We crossed so many borders that one country blended into the next until I had difficulty judging the great distances we had travelled. But then something always happens to bring you back. Careful. I'll do the talking, right. We seek passage to Aqrah. As you see, we are but humble merchants. There's a tax. Of course. How much? One slave. That one. No, no! Let me tell you boy. If we try to betray them in any way we'll be lucky to get out of this land alive let alone in one piece. Look over there. All right now. Come on, you've all seen this before. (Camels groaning) Captain. Captain, wake up, Nicolo's gone. Oh, my God. The boy's probably gone after, after the slave, that little idiot. That little idiot is my brother. Either you help me find him right now or I swear I will snap your neck before you take another breath. Now listen to me, if anyone goes out at this time at night 'tis madness. Either the wild animals will get him or the bandits will. Now, relax, we'll go after him in the morning, promise. (Men snoring) You're risking your life for me. Why? Because you're my friend. (Fire crackling) I tell you what I'll do, take the slaves, search this block over here from the east. If nothing happens then when I reach the top I'll give you a... (Nicolo) Marco! Thank God. I don't know whether to hug you or strangle you. He saved my life. Ugh. How much for the Nubian? This one, he's my favorite and best slave. He was your best slave. You sold him remember? My brother has a point, Captain. Well, then, nine pieces. Nine? Six. Eight. Seven. Done. Ah, not so fast. I could use a knife. Well then you could use one, use it carefully, don't cut yourself. Well, it looks like you're a free man. You are indeed. When we get to Aqrah, you, you do as you wish. Aqrah, that's it, we should be on our way. Come on now, come on. ♪♪ Look now, there is Aqrah. Nicolo, Alexander the Great was here. That's right, and people before him and people after. How long will you be staying? As little time as possible. My destination lies ahead. Looking for your father. Yes. And I'll go as far as China itself if I have to. Will you be going with him, boy? Yes, I am. Oh no, you're not, I have other plans for you. As long as it means heading eastward. Come on boys, no arguing. ♪♪ (Middle eastern music) Okay, good boy. Well, Captain. I'm glad this part of the journey has come to an end. It was a long one. I guess this is where we part ways. Now, I got three words of advice for you for your journey. Please. Listen to me hard will ya? Never trust anyone. Yes, I will heed those words, thank you, be well. God speed. And you my friend you take care of the Captain. Come here. She will, Marco, she will. Come here pretty thing. (Camel grunting) So what are your plans? To enjoy freedom. First, I better help the captain one last time before the camel tear him limb from limb. I'll never forget you my friend. (Animals neighing) (indistinct chatter) You watch our things. I'm going to see if I can find out where Ali Ben Hassad lives. You mean the one uncle calls a thief? The very one. Eyes open, trust no one. Right. (man) Eh, little foreigner, you got any gold in those bags? (Evil laughing) Ahh! I hate when people pick on my little brother. You taught yourself well there, little brother. By watching you. (Gong) Who is so foolish to seek an audience with my master, the great Ali Ben Hassad? My name is Marco Polo of the Polo family in Venice. My uncle is a friend and partner of Ali Ben Hassad. Follow me. Oh great, Ali Ben Hassad upon whom the faith of Allah shines so bright. Please forgive your most unworthy servant, of your most deserved and most needed rest. Master, we have visitors who have travelled far to seek an audience with your greatness. I introduce Marco Polo of the Polo family, merchants of Venice. Marco Polo, I was sure sooner or later someone of your family would return. Welcome to my humble abode. Thank you Ali Ben Hassad, I bring you greetings from my uncle. And this would be your partner? This is my brother Nicolo, and yes, my trusted partner as well. How are things in Venice? Oh, the town is rich and my uncle prospers. But we hear in Venice that you too have prospered and so I was sent by my uncle to seek a reckoning of his partnership with you. As I respectfully point out your seal is attached by your hand. It decrees that you are to pay what is owed upon receipt of this letter to any member of the Polo family. And so, I was sent to collect. Certainly, but we talk about trade tomorrow or later. Youssef, prepare food and wine for our guests, and some entertainment. Of course. Follow me. (Belly dancing music) More wine. (Bell rings) You've had enough little brother. Why is that? Because you're too young. I was old enough this afternoon. Well, that was different. Thanks partner. Senior partner. (speaking foreign language) Awaits in your noble quarter to begin, Master. Then begin. Yella. (claps) (Women giggling) A well matched pair. Would you care for a wager? I don't gamble. Then you're not a true businessman. Well, even if I were to bet I don't have the money to spare. I could lend you some. With all due respect, Ali Ben Hassad, why would I borrow from the man who owes my family money? Would you care to settle your debt right now? Enjoy yourself. We will talk business in the morning. That's what I thought. Let the fight begin. May the best man win. (Grunting) Hsst. Would you care for the honor of finishing the task? I don't kill for sport. And your brother... fighting is like trading. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. I hope you enjoyed the entertainment. It was ah, different. Youssef will show you to your room. I trust that in the morning you'll keep your promise. The sooner we conclude our business the better. Ali Ben Hassad has a very interesting way of entertaining his dinner guests. How can someone do something like that? Yes, Ali Ben Hassad is very well known for his extravagance. Ah, that's been made clear. So, sleep well. Good night. The key. Key? Oh, the key. But you are in the house of Ali Ben Hassad, you are his guests. You have nothing to fear. That may be but just the same, I'd like the key. But sir, I must insist you cannot, you will not, this is an insult to my master, I must. Thank you. How long have you served Ali Ben Hassad? Most of my life. Then you know my father. Yes, he is an honest man. And Ali Ben Hassad? He is my Master. But is he an honest man? Be careful, lock your door tonight. I don't like this place. I'm with you, brother. (Door creaking) We didn't order room service. Marco! Huh... Take him. I guess it's hard to find good help, Ali Ben. So, it would appear. He will not be troubling you again, I can assure you. You know you were right, fighting is like trading. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. Sleep well. Are you all right? Ah, got me right there, right there. Where? No, of course I'm all right. Where is Ali Ben Hassad? Ah, he is not here. Where is he? He sent word he will meet you at noon. Youssef, last night we had a visitor assassin. Now, you tried to warn us, why? Yasmin. Your father is a very good man, Marco. He saved my life when I was very little. You seem to be a decent person Youssef, why don't you leave this place? Your suggestion is a very good one, Marco, there's only one problem. I know too much. Ali Ben would have me killed. I should not be talking with you here, he has spies everywhere. I get the impression Ali Ben Hassad will not be paying the debt he owes my uncle. He is a snake. He's very quiet but oh, so deadly. I give you my second warning, my friend. Beware... Come with me. Yes, yes, of course, we have very very good cheese here, very strong, the best in the region. Come. Sire. Oh, ten thousand apologies worship but as you instructed oh great Master, upon whom Allah has heaped the bounties of beauty, humility and very good judgment here are your guests. Welcome, come in, come in. My patience grows short, Ali Ben Hassad. I want the money owed to my family. There are certain difficulties. Trade is very bad. That's not what we hear. I am owed a great deal of money by a merchant in Damascus. Collect the money and you can keep it. Thus my debt to your father and your uncle will be repaid. In fact I might pay handsomely for any goods you might acquire on the way. Think of it as a business opportunity. And if I were to agree how would we get there? I will provide horses and supplies and as a guide my own trusted servant Youssef. He knows Damascus well and will introduce you to the merchant you seek. You owe the money, why should I go to collect it? Why? I've always wanted to see Damascus. Good, good. You won't live to regret it. That's what I'm afraid of. I'm so glad you've agreed to be reasonable. As for your goods I will keep a sharp eye on them until you return. A safe journey and a safe return. And good riddance. (Chuckles) (slap) Aye! I'm sorry, I thought it was a saddle bag. Youssef. Yes, come, we must go at once. Ah, why is the girl here? I will explain everything later. Come, we must go before Ali Ben Hassad changes his mind. (Middle Eastern music) Marco, now that we've travelled far enough I can give you this. I've taken four bags of gold from Ali Ben Hassad's treasury. These two are for the money he owes you, your father and your uncle. And the other two? Ah, the other two are for me. When Ali finds out what I have done, my life will be worth nothing. And the girl? The girl? The girl. Ah, the girl, umm, the girl she saw me take the money you understand? She must come with us otherwise. Yeah, I know, I know. All right, Youssef, what's your plan? Plan? You do have a plan don't you? Of course, yes. The plan. You see, Ali, he never intended for you to get as far to Damascus and in the evening while you slept, his men were to attack, they were to slit your throats and burn your bodies. I was then to return to Ali with news of your death. He would then send a message to your uncle of your murder. That the money he owed had been paid to you and had been stolen by the bandits. Youssef. Yes? The plan. Ah, yes, plan, plan. Marco, I have friends. What you know of the Knights Templar? Well, we've only met one. They are an order which guard the road to the Holy land. They protect pilgrims and punish the wicked. I know the Grand Master and I know where they are camped. I'm sure if we tell them your story, he'll be willing to help us. But you see the Grand Master he has no high regards for Ali Ben Hassad. All right, let's get going. Youssef? Yes, coming, coming. Thanks to Youssef's warning we abandoned the trip to Damascus and rode to find the Templar Knights. Youssef, despite his shiftiness was proving to be invaluable. (Horse neighing) Youssef? Good to see you again, Youssef. And you, Grand Master. Where are you bound? Eastward to China. It is a long road and a dangerous one. We can only escort you as far as the frontier of the Kingdom of Armenia. We can go no further. We certainly appreciate your help, but I don't want to cause you any trouble. What he means to say, Grand Master, is we gratefully accept your offer and happily take whatever help you can give. You see Ali Ben Hassad has plans to send his soldiers to murder these two while they sleep in the forest tonight. Then let's surprise him and send a message to Ali. We'll be happy to help you with your surprise, however... Youssef. Fear not Youssef, leave that to us. But come, you must be in need of food and drink. And one knows how much you enjoy your drink, Youssef. (Fire crackling) Hey guys. I'd give my two bags of gold to see the look on Ali Ben Hassad's face. Holding true to their word, the Grand Master and his Templar Knights escorted us through the wild lands that lie between Aqrah and Armenia. The strange sights we encountered on our journey were many, but there is one that I vividly recall. It was the precession of the blind. Who are they? Christian prisoners from the wars that still wreck the sand of the holy land. They're blind. All but every fifth man. By order of their captor, they are blinded before being sent back home. Every fifth man is spared the sight of one eye to guide them on their way. That's barbaric. A custom invented I'm ashamed to say by ourselves. Originated by a Christian monarch named Richard the Lionhart. It was thus he dealt with Muslim prisoners after the capture of Aqrah. Sleep well and safe my friends. We take to the road early in the morning. Good night. Good night. Nicolo, from here on end, this journey could be very dangerous. I think it best we find a way to get home. No, Marco, I'm staying. It isn't safe. Who knows what lies ahead? Another adventure I hope. Besides I'm going to watch your back. Oh great, now I can sleep in peace. You know Marco, I cannot go home either. Ali Ben Hassad will have me killed as well. Only my death will be slow and very painful. Well, it appears as though we'll be journeying on together. Yes. At least we have some money thanks to Youssef. (Horse neighing) Marco, if you will excuse us. Yasmin and I are very tired. We're going to bed now, good night. Good night, Youssef. (Jasmine giggling) You know our grandfather once said that many a man has been parted from his money by his lust. Oh, one day even you will be tested. Have you been tested? Oh, yes, I have and I failed. No way. Yes, I did, just like our father and his father before him and his father before him. Nicolo, a beautiful woman has a way of making a man do many things. Why don't you get some sleep, little brother. All right, good night. Good night. That a boy. Good morning, Youssef. Sleep well? Oh, yes, thank you, very soundly. Where's Yasmin? Oh, she's gone. Gone? Where did she go? She has an uncle in Damascus. It is a long way to travel. Does she have any money? Oh, yes, she has money. Wouldn't be two bags of gold, would it? I forgot something back there. I'll be right back. There lies Armenia, Marco. Go with great care. It's ruler grows old and weak and another seeks to take its place. And in his veins runs the blood of Atilla the Hun. Some say that the devil is believed to be the true descendent of Beelzebub himself. Whose name was taken for his own. He seeks to overthrow the old king and become the ruler of all Armenia. Then the sooner we pass through this country the better. Should you encounter the Knights Templar again, show them this ring. They will then know you are a friend of the Knights' or as we were once called the Poor Knights of Christ in the temple of Solomon. Remember we are sworn to protect the weak and innocent and rescue the oppressed. Good luck to you, Marco Polo and may God go with you. You as well. ♪♪ (Horse neighing) I don't know about you Marco, but I don't like it here, this is an evil place. Generally, Youssef, I find your cowardice annoying. On this particular occasion, I have to agree with you. Whoa! (horses neighing) Who are you that dare enter the forbidden land? We are merchants on our way to China. We are unarmed. Clearly we come in peace. All we ask of you is safe passage through Armenia. You're my prisoners, your fate is in the hands of Beelzebub. I knew he'd say that. Silence! We go! (clamoring) (Gong) (man) Who dares to remain standing? Marco sit. Marco Polo, merchant trader of Venice and Nic... and Nicolo Polo, his partner. Do you know who I am? I have to assume you're Beelzebub. Oh, then, you've heard of me. Well, everyone's heard of the devil. Yes. And why aren't you afraid? It really isn't very good for business for people not to be afraid. I'm terrified, I just hide it well. You better be careful. I could have you boiled in oil, hung, drawn and quartered, but today, today I'm in a very, very good mood. All we ask for is safe passage through your land. No one can enter this land without my permission. But since I'm not an unreasonable man, I'll think about it. Take them below. But don't harm them. Yet. Who are you? Marco Polo, and you? Marita. And you are? Sylvia, the lady in waiting to the Princess. Princess? My grandfather is the king, the real king. Then who is Beelzebub? He's nothing but a pretender. My family have ruled this land for generations. He intends to marry me to make his claim to the throne more legitimate, but he's a tyrant. He must never rule this land. Well, it appears that you could use a little help. Excuse me, Marco, all due respect to the young Princess I think we should be concerned with ourselves. Youssef. Yes. Shut up. Of course. Yeah. There must be a way out of here. Don't worry, I'll find a way. I hope so. (Cheering) You're wanted, come. Don't worry, Princess, I've got them right where I want them. Well, almost right where I want them. (Gong) (Cheering) (Crowd booing) This is what I call the devil's gauntlet. Simply make it through, and I shall regard your request favorably. And why should I believe you? The devil is after all the father of lies. Trust me. And if I make it through you will let us go? Yes, of course, but there is something that I haven't told you. No one has ever made it through the devil's gauntlet alive. Begin! (Gong) No, Marco! (Booing) Marco, be careful, you could get killed. Marco, be careful. Marco! Ahh. (Crowd booing) (Booing) (Booing and cheering) Kill him! Look out. (Booing and cheering) Ahh. (Whistles) Stick around. Yeah! I am a man of my word. You and your friends are free to enter the land of Armenia, however, you do not have permission to leave and will do so at your peril. I can use a man as brave as you, Marco Polo, but for the time being you are all my guests but beware, any attempt to depart this land will result in the most unpleasant punishment. It can also be extremely painful. All this play hungers me. Prepare a feast. (Cheering) Marco, I can't believe you made it. You know, Marco, I had absolute confidence in your ability. I knew you could do it. I only wish they would had let me fight in there by your side, but there... (laughing) (gong) A toast! To Marco Polo, the only man to survive the devil's gauntlet. And who now will serve Beelzebub, the devil himself. Argh, Marco, there's an old saying. He who dines with the devil needs a long spoon. In Venice we have a saying as well. He who toasts with the devil burns his soul. (Evil laughing) Where is the bride to be? (man) She's getting dressed for the occasion. Ah. Wedding dress? Perhaps. Well, let us eat. Well, Marco, how do you like Armenia so far? Well, I would say that it has some beautiful sights. Why are you in Armenia? I'm on my way to China, I'm trying to find my father. China? China? What is this talk about China? Marco, you're not going anywhere without my permission. Now, why don't you eat? Is the food bad? Because if it is, I could have the cook boiled in his own soup. I'm just not hungry. Oh, thirsty then? Ah, fill the lady's goblet. Fill all the goblets. (Boisterous laughing) As the feast continued we watched Beelzebub and his people drink themselves into a stupor and a plan began to form. (Snoring) Uh, hmm. Where is everybody? A party with no... I have... I have sung, ah... I've got a plan. Sylvia. Wait, wait a minute. I'll wait here. No! Wake up! Get up! Up! All of you, wake up! Up! Get up! Get up! You fools! You let them escape. Sound the alarm, saddle up immediately. We must not lose the Princess. Aye, aye, you call this a shortcut? (Horn sounding) What's that? They sounded the alarm. They know we've escaped, we better move. (Horn sounding) Ya ya ya! Whoa, two groups! The first follows their tracks. The second follows me. Ride! You're all right? I'm a little weak. You want to rest? No, no, they'll find us. How much further is it? It's another day's walk at least. What's that sound? What sound? (Horses galloping) Hide. Go, go, go. That was close. Everyone all right? Yes. All right, let's go. Mercy, please help. What is it? They're burning the village. They are killing our men. Our children, they are being taken away. Who is doing this? Beelzebub's men. They're looking for Princess Marita. Take care of these women. I'm coming with you. Youssef? (Horses neighing) Let's send these devils back to hell. Marco, I have him. Marco. Okay children, you can come out now. Okay, everybody here? Okay. Let's go back. Woo woo! Not only are you their hero, but you're my hero as well. (Clears throat) Marco, excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt this lovely moment but Beelzebub's men are still after us. We should go-- you understand? Youssef's right, let's go. (Horse neighing) Solomon, we need to see my grandfather now, we're in danger. He's not seeing anybody. He'll see me, I'm his granddaughter. He's not at home. He is not to be disturbed. There are strict regulations. He will see me. It is impossible for him to see anybody unless he gives me the okay. It is important. Grandfather. What happened to you? You disappeared. Beelzebub was holding me as his prisoner, he wants to marry me. Yeah, to help make him finally the legitimate ruler of Armenia. I refused and managed to escape with the help of Marco Polo. Beelzebub is the devil incarnate. His men are murderers, the people are suffering. You must call on them to rise up and destroy him. It is too late, my dear, I have no power and no longer the will to fight. I have had other visitors today. Princess! Marco, we're trapped! Why didn't you warn us? Solomon tried to stop you but you insisted on entering, it was too late. What are your orders? To hold you here until Beelzebub arrives. He's planning a little wedding ceremony. Your grandfather will be giving away the bride. I'm sorry Marita, I had no choice. Grandfather, how could you? You'll be a part of the celebrations. A very spectacular part. The wizards of Beelzebub predict much of this joining when the sun rises in three days time, you will be married. I rather be dead. Take them away! Princess! Princess, don't despair, it isn't over yet. Don't give up. I won't. What? I have an idea. What is it? Come here. There's a little hole up there, it's small but I might be able to get through it. It must lead to the roof. If I can reach to Grand Master and tell him what's going on here perhaps he can help us. Marco, good idea, it is worth a try. I don't think anyone can make it out of here. I'm sure I can make it. I don't know. It is our only chance. I won't fail you. I know you won't. Go, fast, fast. Wait. For luck the ring that Grand Master gave me, you hold onto that. Okay, be careful, let's go. One, two, three. Once my brother descended and escaped the king's palace he set off in search of the Templar Knights. He broke into the King's stables, freed his horse and raced for the border. Once again braving the dangers of the wilderness. Nicolo rode day and night to find the Grand Master. Meanwhile all we could do is wait. The night before the wedding, Beelzebub the devil himself arrived. All is being made ready as you wished. And the Princess? Having her bath. Mmm, in milk I trust? Naturally. What about the Venetians? One of them, the small one, has escaped. Someone will have to pay. Go. Welcome. You're part of the celebration now. You're going to be the main dish. Oh my. Marco, I don't want to be the main dish. Quiet! Okay, easy, easy, easy. (Chuckling) Bring in the Princess. Begin. (Trumpets playing) ♪♪ Go, go! Move! Well done, Marco. Marco! Boy am I glad to see you. We came as soon as possible. They've broken through, destroy them! You'll never marry my granddaughter. You tried to save me. Will you forgive me? I do, I do. Come. Defeat them! (Grunting) Ah, you hurt my head. Well, what do you know? Ahh! Marco! Good job little brother. Marco Polo! Whoa! Beelzebub said you'll never leave Armenia alive. I'm gonna tear you limb from limb. When this is over, you liver's on a stick. I've seen your best, I don't think it is good enough. You really have to learn to be more hospitable. Marco, help! Over here! Look, what do we do now? The Princess is to live, we have no choice but to let them both go. Ah! Let her go. Beelzebub, you and the Princess are free to leave! No! Marco, do as he says! I won't! Come on, don't fail me now. Yes! It's over Beelzebub, you're finished. I think you are right. He's gone. Here, Marco, take back my ring. You may have need of it in the future. We'll never forget all you've done for us. May you find your father, however far you have to travel and however long it takes. And remember you now share with the Knights Templar a common purpose to protect the weak and innocent. And rescue the oppressed. Good luck to you Marco Polo. And to you, Youssef. Will I see you again? Of course you will. Thank you. Alhamdulillah, Princess. Marco? Take care. And now my friend, I must rest. Tomorrow we will continue. Sounds like dreamed-up tales to me. I swear that every word I have spoken is the truth and tomorrow I will tell you of greater dangers, wilder lands and savage people, of flaming powders, of unfathomable riches, of entire cities guilded in gold, and all of this I have seen with my own eyes. ♪♪
