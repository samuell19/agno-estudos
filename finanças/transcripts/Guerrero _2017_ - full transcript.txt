Iguala "Home of the flag" After the disappearance, Mexico is in a state of shock. Various civil organizations from several universities are searching for the students. And they are asking the authorities for a real investigation. Mexico burns. The destiny of the 43 students is still unclear. NARCO STATE, HERE THEY ARE. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 ... Because these bastards are sweeping away everything. After the forced disappearance of the 43 Ayotzinapa students Guerrero, a town beleaguered ... ... by the narco and a corrupt government, rises up. In Tlapa, teachers and activists occupy the city council urging to boycott the upcoming elections and to create a popular assembly. In Iguala, the relatives of disappeared persons organize the search of their loved ones. The citizens of Petaquillas in order to defend themselves of the constant abuse by drug cartels and corrupt authorities form a community police force. Petaquillas' Bridge Left. Listen, comrades. The challenge here is to set tires. To make holes and set tires. - Does anyone know how to? - Like making a step? Yes. Who knows how to? The ones working are young people, once accused of a crime. Like drug possession. Some are suspected "falcons." People who pass on informations to cartels. Apparent misdemeanors. Most of them drug related. They have already served a sentence. And the second part of the sentence is... the obligation of doing community service. I have been participating in the community police because ... ... the mission was a community project ... ... for the common good. The thing here is that a great water flow comes downhill. So we're digging a ditch. But I'm not sure if it should be here, because the wall may fall down. If we dig it here, it'd go downhill. We need to analyze it, so the wall won't fall. It may fall down otherwise. I never wanted to fight with guns against the narcos. But against the bad government, I wanted to fight all my life. We cannot see ourselves only as police officers or just as a security protect. Security and development are the two central pillars. None is more important than the other. Now security is more urgent but not more important. We can take some actions that are clearly urgent. One of them is the reforestation. Rain season is about to start and it's the time to reforest. When a project gestates in a vertical way, it's a failure. A failure. A project should gestate from the interest and consciousness of the people. We need the participation of the real actors. And the real actor are ... The real actors aren't the ones here right now. The real actor for this to be a success ... -It's the people. It's the people. Now how do we engage people? Let's eat, comrades! I hope you work as much as you can. Next Sunday we come here to finish, then we go to another community. You are working for your community. In the beginning it's a punishment ... But later when your comrades thank you for your work ... That is priceless. Let's go, Coni. I mean, really, there was a beautiful moment when a banner was hung from the bridge ... and it said, "Welcome to community territory." I felt utterly fulfilled. It was like reaching hope. Unfortunately, throughout the years, political parties have only divided people. People, instead of working together to fight for their common interests ... ... they're divided and fight each other. And they fight for their party's interests. Trying to stop an alection. They see it as an electoral offense. You can go to jail. And we're a threat to the State. In this country, everything is dangerous. Being an activist much more so. Throughout the country, there has been disappeared and murdered activists. It's way more dangerous to do nothing about it. They will continue to do as they please. We've arrived to school. They're building a wall. Since it's election year, the president is ... He's trying to look good with public works. To convert the vitamins the leave has ... ... to be contained in a flask ... Let's write, "vitamins." If we analyse the plans and study programs when they refer to "competences" in education and "educational standards" ... What they mean is to raise docile and obedient people. People that serve capitalism, money. People that serve their boss and not their community. And that the one who protest and defend their rights is a criminal. Who was the ancestor of the dog? The wolf. Very good. Eventually that wolf became a dog. How do you think that happened? Human beings didn't live as we do now, in towns. -They were nomads. -Exactly. Very good. When humans were nomads they'd leave bones, and skin that wolves could eat... Time is our worst enemy. If I sleep in for another half hour I may make a bit more progress here. I don't know how much deeper to dig. In this country, the word "justice" exists, but it isn't enforced. I go out to search, dig. I've been to criminals' territories. I didn't do that before. We found a place in Coahuila, where ... some people were burned up. We don't know how many. I stole a bone from that search. Unfortunately, they were burned up. There's no way to identify them. This was a human being. In Guerrero, we're lucky because they don't disappear our relatives like this. Let's go. My father bought this land 32 years ago. I moved here, to Petaquillas. Recently, I've thought of settling down here. This territory is controlled by the FUSDEG Community System. It's a very important territory, because historically this is where Guerrero's amapola has been produced. It's the amapola that has been sold in the United States, for over 50 years. The amapola is used to produce heroin. What I have tried to do in life is ... ... to be where I can fight for something. He was my father, Saul LÃ³pez LÃ³pez. She's my mother. They were newlyweds. He was documenting the social movement that was taking place in the city. Well, not just in the city, but in the whole state of Guerrero. They called people to join them and defend the building ... ... where the university strike was taking place. They clashed with the army. My father climbed to the roof of a house ... and he took pictures from there. He captured the first moments, when the soldiers and the people clashed. When he was taking these pictures, a soldier sees him ... ... and fires at him. Apparently he lowered his camera, the shot hits the camera and ricochets ... ... and destroys his jaw, on the left side. Over 20 people were killed. His pictures became representative of the 60's movement. The thing with Guerrero is that ... ... there has always been a strong repression towards social movements. And at the same time there has always been groups fighting violently or peacefully. I take a lot after him. Maybe it happened to him like it happened to me with FUSDEG. He got excited and got involved in a very combative movement and with a very important mission for Guerrero. What we seek is ... ... a real democracy for the people. Just like in native communities. When they appoint their leaders, they have a community assembly. And they all have to serve as leaders, at least once. Because they don't get paid for it. There must be a people's council. The president shouldn't be the lord and master. Presidents come and go and they only get rich and steal. Until now, Tlapa's city council is still occupied. This makes you "abandon" your family. You barely spend time with them! And my wife... well! She doesn't like me spending most of my time there. DON'T VOTE But history will judge us. I DON'T VOTE. I TAKE ACTION. We have it occupied in solidarity to the parents. We won't move because the students haven't appeared. Only if the parents tells us to leave, we leave. If they tell us to negotiate, we'll do so. Let's pray. Our Lord, we offer you this sacrifice to heavenly things. Amen. You can go in peace. May the relatives of the disappeared approach. The mass graves' hunter, let me hug you. The next generation of mass graves' hunters. He'll find the ones we don't. Yeah. Here, the police escort. - Good morning. - I'm sorry, I didn't know the time... - Don't worry. Let's go... to the 5 mass graves where... 30 young people were found. I'm coming. Look, you even have spare shoes. My snacks! They're all crushed. Mao Tse-Tung says that when your enemy attacks you and discredits you rejoice for you're doing things right. Worry when the enemy indulges and pampers you because it means you're goofing around. They should be worried, not us. Rights should be promoted, guaranteed. They shouldn't be imposed. And they wanna impose the right to vote. What do you think, ToÃ±o? The only way is to fight. Tune in a radio station with men's music. Revolutionary music. Don't bullshit us! That's for narcos. Preserve the scene without lifting any evidence. No one should touch what is there. So we can test the DNA in the remains. I think I'm the oldest one. How old are you? What do you think? 50? 55? I look that old!? I'm 50 years old. I'm about to turn 50. - How much he said? - 55. Do you believe that? He's mean. We caught a guy. He does't have an ID. He has a gunshot in his hand. He could be people of "El Taliban". I wasn't doing anything bad. Yes, but the operation can't stop! What did he have? Marijuana. They think he works for "El Taliban." They get them there, they kill them and then they throw them. Sometimes they throw them alive. I have tape to close the area. We could do that to send a signal to the media that ... The first one is up there. Next to the blue can. The first one is there. The second one is lower. Shall we send the tape? Let's do something right in that sense. Take the tape to close the area where the bones are. You first because of age. With a 10-day blockade of ports, airports, roads ... We paralyze production. Without any bloodshed. A stoppage. You can tell your boss to fuck off. They're used to that. But paralyze their production, ruin their profits. You'll see how they respond. Ok, the goal of the the government is ... ... to put fear into other organizations. Don't get organized, because if you do, you'll be in jail or dead. Like the community police officers. Well we're already here. There's conscience. We lack wealth, but we do have a clean conscience. Follow us, comrades. Let's go! They've used these to tie victims up. I just can't imagine ... how they brought our relatives here. My brother ... ... was kidnapped. And I figure he was probably here. This puzzles us. We mark it as probable mass grave. There's no reason for a hole to be in here. We pile up some rocks to mark that there is one here. The PGR digs them up and removes the corpses. They take to their labs everything they recover to carry out DNA tests. They're very sluggish. In this area there are around seven possible mass graves but the holes seem too big. They say we tamper with evidence. I think that after all this time, my brother, after three years... What evidence can they find? We've seen their neglect. This isn't new. It has happen for years. There are disappeared persons from the 80's and 70's. From what they call the "Dirty War." Look, Mario. Those things belonged to them, right Mario? Can anyone take photos? These blankets don't get here by themselves. That's a bedspread. I cried here for the first time. I arrived up here. Someone might recognize these boots. If you want, take a picture. - The shorts' tag might have an ID. - No, we already checked. 30 burned bodies were found here. The stench was unbearable. Unburned wood is coated with human fat. And the smell is awful. Horror, hatred, helplessness can be smelled here. All of that exists here. It exists on this camp. MILITARY - NARCO NARCO STATE, GET OUT OF GUERRERO! WELCOME TO A SAFE, COMMUNITY TERRITORY. We should try to do it right. Otherwise we are doing the same as the government. We should do our best. We should avoid doing things on the spur of the moment. We should know the process. In this case we should close the area, wait for the teams ... To do things right. With preparation and professionalism. These are points that we should follow to avoid making the same mistakes the State makes. The State just mixes things up. Yes, ma'am. The first mass grave. I dunno how many bodies were recovered. They were burned. All this came out of their excavation. The wood's still buried down there. No, they're human bones. They're from a hand. They still smell. Check it. - These are bones from a hand. - That's not possible. These appeared from the dirt right here. Mr. Raul, can I borrow this? There'll be more bones around here. We've found many bodies. They come up here daily with the PGR. Every day. We already recognize bones. It hurts that they tell us they are careful ... ... and then we find these. This is also a bone, isn't it? Yes, it is. - Look, here. - Here's another bone. There are several here. - Look. - Those are bones. How can this happen? These are from either a knee or an elbow. That's why they fear us watching them. Because they're sloppy and here's the proof. It's 12 plus 6, gotta be 18 vertebrae. Because they have different names. Three, four, six. There are seven here. A finger. It's a toe. This is a toe. Look. Smell it. There were some seedlike things, right? It smells bad! - There's some hair here. - It's blond. Look, it's blond. - There's hair here, look! - Here it is. Supposedly, it's easier to extract DNA from hair, right? - Look! - Does it have flesh? Does it have flesh? - It's got skin. - It still has skin. Look at that Mario! No, just a little twig. It looked like a bone. Comrade ToÃ±o has the floor now. We'd like to thank the media for coming to this city's council, which belongs to the people. It's been 6 months since the tragedy in Iguala, and the authorities haven't given a clear answer to the demands of those 43 parents. The State is trying to impose elections, knowing that in a popular assembly we agreed to boycott electoral activities in the state of Guerrero. The way that the electoral institute appoints governors is not viable. DO NOT VOTE Listen, one thing is the big movement and another's this cartoon of a movement. I've told them so. And they don't like it. Lenin, Marx, dialectics of the concrete ... These morons know shit about it. What's dialectics of the concrete? It's to go all around to get to the essence of the thing itself. That's dialectics of the concrete. Do you think they know about it? Do you know Lenin? Do you think they know? Do you think they know Marx, Engels? Or Engels. What did Engels do? But they're "a movement." Yeah, right! Excuse me. Revolutionary alcoholism. Comrades. Young people. My name is Antonio Vivar. I'm an indigenous law attorney. The popular movement has overtaken a struggle now eight months old. We're tired ... physically, economically. We've bugged some sectors. Some of them from society. But this is a necessary struggle, comrades. Why? Because it's not just about Ayotzinapa. Today's struggle is for all those who disappeared. For all the murdered ones. For all the raped women. For all those being kidnapped. Comrades, it is necessary that you take part in the struggle. Those who went to get the bags, please. I ask you not to touch the remains. The bags, only. Please, don't come too close. They seem to be two men. They're remains of a broken skull. Gentlemen, it's a shame that this shitty government ignores and discredits our heroic police, and call it illegitimate. Legitimacy is bestowed by the people. Because it was appointed by the people. - Yes or no, comrades? - Yes. - I can't hear you. Yes or no? - Yes! It seems that crime is spreading gradually. They're gaining terrain. Because we allow them to. It's necessary, I insist, that every last one of us keeps a weapon at home. I don't promote violence, comrades. It's the last thing I want. We're tolerant, but tolerance also has its limits. The problem with the narco, with hitmen, it wasn't about drugs. The problem was when their greed for money crossed the line. And they started kidnapping because they wanted more money. - Look at his short! And here they are. But we're not gonna allow it. The lady said, "Oh, look at these cute boys." And then, you started punching and shoving at each other. You'd just made your First Communion. I was so embarrassed. She just had said you were the cutest boys. You should've told her we were exorcising. - He looks so young here. - Yes. Here he is not so chubby. Where's your uncle TomÃ¡s? You know him. You do. Uncle Tito. You do know your uncle. Don't you remember him? How many months old was he? - Five, six? - Six, six. He has a photo with TomÃ¡s. Here, look. Look who's here. He doesn't know him. Who's that? - My uncle TomÃ¡s. - Your uncle Tommy. A journalist says we even smile differently. I said no, we're just older. But I guess we do. Look, his smile. Look. It's his natural smile. We were all happy and joyful. The first call was for Mario. And you put me through. They said he was kidnapped and hung up. That's when you looked for the car. - Who got the car? - Vero and I did. I thought they'd moved it... in the morning with a tractor. They didn't even close the doors. I think they just dumped it there because a delivery man told me, "We went by and the engine was running." "It was around 7 am and it was on." "We even thought TomÃ¡s was around here." "He must've brought somebody here." He was well-known then. Everyone knew his car. The way the car was found? The way it was found. So they dragged him out quickly. Because they didn't even close the doors. Who knows? Hello. They threw some flyers, urging to stop the community police or there will be consequences, for everybody. There are 3 opposing forces â€“ UPOEG, accused of being with the cartels, the cartels and us, FUSDEG. 3 different stances, which are apparently in opposition. Because supposedly UPOEG also fights the cartels. It's a very dangerous situation because the 3 of them are well armed. This checkpoint is of UPOEG. Good afternoon. This is Acahuizotla. This community is allied with UPOEG. FUSDEG is formed as the result of the separation from the UPOEG. UPOEG was the territorial project. When it became clear that it wasn't a community project, but just a way to get power... They started receiving bribes, and releasing criminals ... until they separated. I'll show you in the base. I made a draft the principles ... ... a police officer, a guard must have. And that's what we're doing. We're only nine members, damn it. But every time we're on duty there's something to do. HISTORY IS MADE BY MEN Very well, but women do too. - Yes, of course! - Men and women. - You said it right, more so women. - Yes. -So, this is the community base. -Yes. It was the base of the local police but we remodelled it. Then we built that one because we're installing a barrier arm... to have a little more control. This is me. We went to Nicaragua to support the Sandinista movement after the triumph of their revolution. A large group of university comrades went too. This is the Guerrero contingent. From the then Guerrero Autonomous University. We're in Managua. My wife's uneasy about my participation. My children instead of being upset... My eldest son, Lenin, he says, "Dad, listen..." "What you're doing is right. It's right. We got your back." "Every human being ..." "... came to this world with a mission." I tell him, "You're damn right son." The hat is a must. I can't live without it. Don't be shy and grab me! Go to Chilapa, scumbags! You got nothing to do here. INE (National Electoral Institute) ELECTORAL FRAUD! Forward group. The struggle continues. -Ayotzi lives. -The struggle continues. We gotta go around, comrades. Out! Go fuck yourselves! Come on, scumbags. No rocks. Stop the rocks. Stop the rocks. Teacher, move over, move over. If they had caught one of us they would have killed him. Go tell your superiors that we respect here. Let's go. Let's go. Ayotzi lives! The struggle continues! You've been defending him for long. We're not defending him! - We're not defending him! - Cool down! Please, calm down, comrades. Send that scumbag to the front. To the people of Tlapa... Today we have one of their policemen detained. We also have a lot of comrades injured. Today state police came to provoke the movement. Our comrades only responded to the aggression. Because they are policemen. And the ones who took the students were policemen. We're being told that the clash group is coming our way to hit the movement! Ayotzi lives! The struggle continues! Ayotzi lives, lives! The struggle continues, continues! That's the clash group. Supported by the state police. Bring the loudspeaker truck. Bring it to stop 'em! Come on, dudes! THE PEOPLE SERVE THE PEOPLE Today the situation in the whole country is critical. And it's important because tomorrow is election day. And they're the most illegitimate ones ever. A large part of the population is against them. Regionally, we decided not to stop them. Out of respect of the people who ... ... still have one last hope. They wanna vote, use their right. As we decided not to boycott them, there are some people who did. They're very brave people. Today's proposition is to... share with you a petition made... by the Ayotzinapa comrades, who came yesterday. If the army or the police occupy the Normal School, they would, most likely, need temporary shelter. Are you in favor of sheltering Ayotzinapa comrades? Raise your hand if you're in favor. These people are lying. They should speak truth so that ... So that you understand. Because you don't understand what they're saying. They're speaking in favor of political parties. I wanna make it clear, comrades. Let's fight! This is how you speak! Listen, Mr. Gersain. Mr. Gersain, Mr. Gersa. What lies did I tell? You're not saying anything. I won't say anything else. I didn't tell any lies, as you said. Just don't! I already said it. What really worries me ... I don't speak for all the people. If we support the Ayotzinapa students, which is valid, and true, we should support them. What if the clash group comes? If we think Ayotzinapa as just a clash group, we're giving wrong information. I'm sorry but the Ayotzinapa comrades ... They're the most dignified people in Guerrero. Because they're the only ones fighting. And for ages. I think it's important that we realize ... that today and tomorrow ... ... are days of brutal repression. It's not about deserving it. It's like telling a beaten up woman, "What did you do?" We're in a safe place. In this country ... Unfortunately, people with different political and social views have no place in here. Watching poor people broke people like us with no education beat up a teacher who fights to end with all that. Watching that is very dismaying. Because ... The people we're fighting for ... are beating us up, Aren't they? They wanted the movement leaders to sign ... a document where they promised ... not to take action against the election. That was their condition. Because of the election they're doing all this. Listen. We see that the teachers are demonstrating peacefully. Listen, listen, listen. People in Tlapa know who we are. We're being hunted down. I was told they're after me too. I'm wanted. A teacher told me yesterday she overheard a police officer saying they wanted to catch the tall one. The tall one is me. We, the teachers, are not stopping the election. PRI - MURDERERS We hereby submit our resignation as Electoral Counselors of the 05 INE District Council based in Tlapa. Because we don't want to validate with our presence... the different incidents of social and political violence occurred in our district. We are convinced that the Federal and State governments have contributed to social instability. And they greatly contribute by not generating the necessary conditions for the celebration of the concurrent elections programmed for June 7th. As Electoral District Counselors and the citizens we're no strangers to social and political crisis that disrupts the state of Guerrero. Such as the violent actions, the mass forced disappearances of students government corruption, flagrant violations of human rights ... It starts here. Look. The cops, it's the cops. They're getting ready, you see? Here. Normal School organized the demonstration. The gathering would start here. I think it's right here. Yeah, it's here. We're here. We'd like to decide whether to march or make a permanent sit-in to protect the entrance to the Ayotzinapa Normal School. If the army or the federal police want to enter they'll have to do it through this gate. The people of Tixtla the people of Guerrero and many states of the Republic nationwide are against the elections taking place tomorrow June 7th. Because they took them alive! Alive we want them back! Alert! Alert! it's walking ... ... popular guerrilla through Latin America! Fight, fight, fight! Don't stop fighting. For a scientific and popular education. Because they took them alive, alive we want them back. Shoulder to shoulder, elbow to elbow. We're all, we're all Ayotzi. We'll never beat the government ... ... in the ballots. MUNICIPAL POPULAR ASSEMBLY We need to get organized in another way in order to give the power to the people, so they can appoint their rulers. That's why we express this outrage at this government that doesn't help us to find them. Enrique? Hello, it's me! I'm in Tixtla. I can barely hear you. How are things there? What happened? Really? Ours? Don't say! It's terrible! Yes, yes. Yes, yes. It's worse than we thought. Petaquillas Community Police went to ... FUSDEG Police went to a town because there was a problem and they clashed against UPOEG again. And apparently there are five casualties. This can be an excellent excuse for the government to block us. To tell, "You see ..." "... you can't agree on anything." "So we're disarming everyone." "We disarm the community police and UPOEG." Comrades, as you already know FUSDEG suffered three casualties. The other side ... ... suffered twelve, I think. Their casualties. You know what, comrades? You know what? Don't feel down, comrades. We gotta show what we're made of. What people from Petaquillas are made of. Long live the community police! Long live! That's it. Long live Petaquillas! Long live! Twelve from the other side! It's nonsense, it's horrible! And three from ours. From the same family. In the towns of Acapulco and Juan R. Escudero there's a lot of confusion about who's in FUSDEG and who's in UPOEG. Because in both towns, there are still groups of police officers more loyal to UPOEG. We insist that there should not be a confrontation. Not to have a large commission going in and trying to convince them because that's a way of making trouble, that's a provocation. I'm on my way to vote. UNTIL VICTORY, ALWAYS FREE AND SECRET VOTE STATE POLICE This was the parking lot. The navy and army burned several cars here. A Ford truck plate. We don't burn cars on the hills. I don't know why they burned them. Today, it's Sunday. Election day. I'm more interested in finding my family than voting for another government. We speak a different language. We have different interests now. What a nasty ... What a nasty way to live. NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL WORKERS UNION We are in Tlapa, on the high mountains. There were some fellow teachers and teenagers. They hit them and entered. They hit our comrades. You could hear their screams. I counted 10 patrol cars. It's not fair, they come looking for trouble. We were all calm. The election is going smoothly. The teachers are here in their office. Look, neighbors. Some comrades already made a proposal. The elections are being held. And a way of making pressure ... ... is to stop the election. Until we don't get our comrades back, we won't release the voting booths. Let's go to the voting booth. But without violence. Everyone be calm! Be calm, comrades, because we're civilians. We're coming through, coming through. Let us through, please. We're from this neighborhood. We're residents. What we're doing is defending our neighborhood. It's not fair, you took children. Look at the situation of the country. It seems they've picked up the voting booths. What we must do now ... ... is to box the Federal police. To the roofs, let's stone them. A few days ago, you also attacked the teachers. We ask educational workers, workers in general .... ... and residents of the neighborhoods ... ... to come help us. Here we are. Do you think they would take revenge? No. They were subordinates. They only followed orders. Yes. They were just sheep. I don't think so. They definitely won't do anything. They won't fight because they know they will loose. Someone has to fall. That is the nature of this fight. Yes, this is hard. Not like this. No. Why like this? Why? Why like this? Why? Why? The abandoned people had to take arms ... Fill up with courage ... And fight â€“ this is the cost of sacrifice. God has won some angels that without a doubt will be on His glory ... Because they were people who gave their lives for others. This shouldn't be here. In my hometown a family whose son disappeared ... We found him in Iguala. In the lagoon area. I met the family in the group. And they looked like ... the way we all do. Now they've recovered their son... .. even if it's nothing but bones ... ... their look already changed. They've found ... peace. I call that a miracle. For my brother the negotiation lasted two and a half months but there was never proof of life. The day they put my brother through, one gets really emotional. I remember my brother's words. "Bro, I'm kidnapped." "Ask our friends to help you raise the money they want." We were all jumpy. It was a Sunday. We wanted to go pay the ransom. But we were advised by experts to wait. "This is business." "If they have your relative, they'll call back ..." "... because they want your money." And they did call back. I told them, "Hey, I'm nervous." "Put my brother through." But it's not so easy. They were always so rude. "Fuck you. I make the rules here." "You want me to kill him? "You want me to kill him now?" One is nervous, begging. "Please, I'm nervous. Put my brother through." "I didn't recognize him." So they put him through. It was the same words, "Bro, I'm kidnapped." "Ask our friends to help you raise the money they want." The advisors told us, from their experience, that it was a recording. "A recording doesn't warrants that your brother ..." "... is still alive." Watch out, watch out, watch out with Guerrero. Guerrilla People! Go away! Out, out, out! We bought your weapons so you'll defend us. Not to repress us, assholes! You eat thanks to us, jerks! Fucking government! Look. â€“ How much longer to ... We already did something important. We forced them back to the highway. You did it? - We all did it. - Because you say we did it. I didn't say I did it alone. All right? We gotta keep cool. And not give in to provocations. Are we waiting for dusk to be beaten up? We gotta disarm the ones we have here. And lock them up somewhere. In the chapel. We gotta regroup because we're all scattered. We've been informed that the army is surrounding us. What do you think? Right away, right away! - Peacefully, peacefully. - Peacefully. There are more coming. Ready to hit you! We want to control that. We're in the same situation. We have orders to cool down. The only thing I ask. The only thing, please. Leave me here with my people. We won't move or do anything here. It's the only thing I ask. People don't want that. - Do you want to be beaten? - No, no! Can you control those people? When people get angry, it's another story. The Delegate is here representing us. Nothing will happen to you. - It's OK. - That's enough. - Easy, we're smart. - Yes. Give us the radio to talk to your people. Up, get on please. Neighbors, listen up. We're not going to let them... Go ahead! Let us talk. They agree to leave. Go ahead. So, please. Make way so that they can go through. Make way. Leave one by one. Calm down neighbors. For the last time. Bring ropes. The people united will never be defeated! The people united will never be defeated! Cool down, cool down. Make way, please. Don't hit them. It's time motherfuckers. Murderers! - The fence. - Close the fence to stop them. It's for them not to beat them. Do not give in to provocations! We reached an agreement with the government. They've promised to release our comrades. In Tlapa, something is happening. And it was bound to happen. But there were doubts ... ... whether the people would participate or not. But they messed with what's most sacred â€“ the family. The Feds arrived with their usual violence. And they trespassed private property. All the people participating in this situation, are living a very harsh experience. And now they realize ... We can tell them and explain. But today they're living it. Today they're setting their parties aside, and they're coming together. Now they realize that the people united will never be defeated. They're living it. Ayotzinapa sparked the fire. Today the fire is spreading. I don't want to go on. I don't see eye to eye on everything. Of course I can participate and do things. Everyday reality keeps pushing us into the police realm. On top of that, there's no real vision of doing transforming and revolutionary things. We're sucked up by police stuff by chasing criminals all the time. There's a vision that violence is a way. For example to make criminals spill the beans. Truly disgusting and nasty things. Totally far from a respect and conviction logic. A completely different project. That really disheartens me. I'll keep my distance. And I'm sure that ... the day they try to fuck us up ... Like when we need to mobilize ... I'll surely fall into temptation and mobilize. We were on top of the chapel. They called the alert for the riot police. They wanted to free their partners. The Delegate made a mistake. He wouldn't touch them. He wouldn't disarm them. They were still armed and ... ... they were sent inside the church like that. The riot police got all the way in. I saw some detonation from inside the church. And I saw ... ... the guy called ToÃ±o ... ... lying on the ground. He was unconscious. He had a ... ... gunshot wound ... ... in the heart. I think ... Nothing will change around here. - Come down. - Calm down, let me through. - ToÃ±o! Bro, let me through. - Was he shot? - Yes, let me through. - Yes, he was shot. - ToÃ±o, look at me. Please, come round! I think it's on his right side. He's still alive. -Ok, ok, let's go. -C'mon, c'mon. Quick, please, quick. ToÃ±o, it's OK, ToÃ±o. - The cell phone, pick it up. - ToÃ±o! Good evening, Mexican people. Democracy makes progress in Mexico. This Sunday we exercised our voting right with the simple, yet significant, action of going to the voting booth and place our vote in the ballot box, confirming our desire to live in a country of rights and liberties, of plurality and democracy. Some people tried to wrong the election. In the past few days they even participated in violent acts trying to dishearten the population. However, despite all that this Sunday, millions of Mexicans went to vote. Convinced that democracy is the best path for Mexico. Thank you very much. I bring you all the news and photographs of this bloody electoral day here in Tlapa. I have all the information of this clash in Tlapa! There are deaths, injured and detained persons! One dead riddled with bullets yesterday night! Several injured and 16 detained. We have the names and the photographs. See the preliminary results of yesterday's election! 16 deaths in the community police! This criminal groups of community police faced off and 16 community policemen died. JUSTICE ST. Yes, let's go. But that doesn't mean they won't kill us. Bad guys come out whenever they want. Yes, we've been out of town often in lots of meetings in Mexico City. But still nothing, uncle. No, I don't know what they did to those people. Yes, it's been more than a year. They must think it's over. They've solved their problem. Don't mention Aguas Blancas. That was Figueroa's deed. You can mention any ... Anything but Aguas Blancas. And as if nothing happened, uncle. I hope they're brought to justice one day for what they did. No, we have already rebel. We've grown. I feel nostalgia, sadness and rage ... I have mixed up feelings. Because he didn't died because of a personal cause. He died for a social cause. ToÃ±o was always there willing to convey a message to the people, a message of what was wrong in this country. Unmasking all the lies that the political parties tell us each election. He paid with his life for it. ToÃ±o always said, "what will happen after the 7th, who will die?" ToÃ±o always liked to organize, to tell people what to do. Police noticed that. Maybe it wasn't his intention but unconsciously he sacrificed himself. TOÃ‘O LIVES NEITHER FORGIVENESS NOR OBLIVION From now on if you want to honor his memory if you want to remember comrade Antonio I don't want you to ask ... ... for a moment of silence in mourning. He would've wanted a war cry that lasts an eternity. Long live commander ToÃ±o. Your death shall be avenged. And who shall avenge it? The organized people. Fight, fight, don't stop fighting for a popular government, for workers and farmers. The UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances issued precautionary measures to the search group of disappeared persons. So we don't move without police security. It's an agreement, they must be here. It's 10:27 and officers haven't arrived. It's dangerous out there. We've been threatened. "Stop searching. Just drop it." "We're gonna kill another relative." I have a photo of a guy who warned me to cut it out. "The boss is telling you to stop." "Or else we're gonna take you down." And I replied, "Tell your boss I'm just looking for my brother." "I'm not looking for those who did it." "I don't care about them." "I just want my brother back." Hello? - Mario? - How are you, sir? Look, they answered already. I don't think they'd come Mario. You should've told me on Wednesday. I called you to know ... whether the police officers would join us or not. Who did you call? I called you, on the phone. I'm sorry Mario, but you didn't. I mean ... Did we talk on Wednesday? Wednesday or Tuesday, I asked for security. You said it had been arranged. But that was long ago. It was last week Mario. It was this week, my phone registered it. No. I didn't get any calls, Mario. Ok, no problem. â€“ Yes, there is a problem, we're already here! If someone had let me know I would've gotten in touch with you. Yeah, because, well... At council meeting we'll report government blunders, because you promised to provide security but you haven't delivered. Mario, don't go without security, please. Ok, I won't. 11 am and we're informed they won't come. No, not without security. Comrades, they say there won't be security. We don't go because there's no security and something could happen to us. The day something happens to us we'll be really fucked. There are bodies in that cave and they'll remain there. If one of us gets killed, that person won't be here next Sunday. Mrs. Pera. - Don't give up. - No, Mario, we won't. We're here. Keep on looking for your relatives. I was going to Mexico City tomorrow anyway. - Bye, Mario. - Take care. -See you. -Have a nice day. The government excuse is that... LONG LIVE THE COMMUNITY, FUSDEG PRESENT Down with the bad government! Long live FUSDEG! Long live! We have to fight. We're not confronting. There's no violence. Just to the U-turn and that's it. We're not asking for anything else. You can go through, but unarmed. As any citizen can go through, unarmed. - Wherever you wanna go. - Yeah, but ... There's an agreement with the federal government. Not state, but the federal government. FUSDEG has free transit in its territories. State police, you're also part of the people. You also suffer. You should be on the people's side. Police officers, you're also part of the people. It's outrageous with all due respect, that you come as State's negotiator and knowing we were coming you didn't place your checkpoint ahead. I understand you're worried we might enter Chilpancingo. But then go to Chilpancingo's limits. You're invading Petaquillas. They want to provoke us. To come and hit us later and blame us for it. That's the way your boss operates. That truck you put there... Put it at Parador del MarquÃ©s. This is our territory! On January 11th my husband was killed. Where were you then? With the criminals. You don't protect anyone. The government does nothing but evil. They never do any good for the people. We're all working so that you can eat. Sowing corn, sowing beans... Corrupt government! MISSING IN ORIZABA, VERACRUZ. THE FIGHT FOR OUR CHILDREN NEVER ENDS - They... What's that called? - Incinerate him. They incinerate him. Then apparently they ... enter a furnace at more than 100 degrees and it's a closed space. And after three or four hours burning they put the remains in a crushing machine. - Grinder. - A grinding process. So just imagine. WHERE ARE OUR DISAPPEARED RELATIVES? Time's up! Today, reality is that due to dehumanization and social net in Mexico, there are no conditions for every state to take responsibility of its disappearances. That is to say, most disappearances have been perpetrated by organized crime due to this national decomposition. If we don't walk having in mind the country's context, we're going round in circles. The parents of the Ayotzinapa students are here. Can we give them the floor? Good evening. Ladies and gentlemen. We are the parents of the 43 students who are missing today. We've been going to a lot of places asking for your support and for you to join us to demand from this government that they return our children. Because there's evidence that the local, state and federal police were involved in this incident. We have a national network. It's made up of over 30 organizations. Let's talk outside. My son changed my life because ... when you have such a responsibility you take things more seriously. This fight, this resistance, to reject the establishment ... It's all for him and the other children. We want to leave them a better world. With this situation in our country, you have a conscious about the state of things ... It's very difficult for me to turn the other way. Many citizens are discontented. That explains the state terrorism policy. With the fear and punches they infringe on us ... They somehow stop us. All these things that the ruling class is trying to impose ... It's going to result in a very big social clash. Here in Guerrero, there is a long tradition of that. And it will culminate in lots of bloodshed, lots of deaths. Common people are the ones getting killed. We come out searching. I went to Cocula on Saturday. There's information about the burning of four students. Have you heard of it? Way before the landfill. This is next to the Cocula landfill. Next to it? That's the ash left when the government found the bones. Here it's true, not as in the landfill version. Yeah. I even have some bones that I picked up there. This is ash. It's best if you don't touch them. These are just bone fragments. They're burned bones. We got there. We put them on that rock. Where is the work? Their protocols of not leaving anything? They're tiny. It was a huge bonfire. People say the flames roared. They could be seen from the distance, but weren't big enogh to burn everyone. Not everyone was burned. Remember that. Not everyone was burned. They talk about only four students. I'm looking for my brother. I'm not looking for your relatives. I look for mine and in searching I find a lot of people. Maths don't lie. If you find eight people in seven years, and 13 people go missing every day, as society, we're doing something wrong. Why don't we think about national unification? You're requesting for it. And we already have it. I told Mario when we met, "You don't need to walk seven years ..." "... the way I did." "Tell me what you can use from me." "Ask me anything I can help you with." "And I'll help you." It's the ones whose chairs are empty. I'm missing half my family. And my house isn't a home anymore. The moment they disappeared ... I never came back. Because it's just an empty house. My house is experiencing disaster. And if I come back, I'll come back in defeat. Because we grieve for our disappeared relatives. We miss them. We get home ... and feel broken again. So do we. I don't mind dying. I'm not afraid. I think... living the way I live. - I don't give a fuck about dying. - It's not about dying. - I mean in case it comes to that. - It's not about dying. But yeah, we gotta fight first. I'm not interested in dying. They have tried to kill me twice. Put it there. - Alcohol. - Alcohol? Yes, alcohol. Take it. Alcohol, painkillers, here's the box. Here, you can tie it up. Carry it like this. I don't think I'm ready for war. It's not the time for a group of armed guys to do something. If an armed conflict started the government would have the perfect excuse to kill us all. Here in Guerrero's high mountains we believe and dream for a better world. In a world of peace and fraternity. A world of justice â€“ there can't be peace without justice. We fight and dream for that world. A world of fraternity. Make sure you turn off your cell phones, radio communication devices, or any other gadget which may distract the speakers. My name's Mario Vergara HernÃ¡ndez. My brother is kidnapped. And I've been told to use these spaces where society is getting an education. We've met the Attorney General, senators, representatives, and all they do is listen to us. But this is a huge problem. I think the government won't solve it. Society must solve it. When I come to Mexico City, my mom gives me lots of recommendations. If they ask for the time, don't answer. If they greet you, don't answer. And ... We come here with lots of fears. It's said there are over 30,000 missing people. Multiply that for four children in that family. It's lots of thousands. Those children are growing with hatred. They're growing with a grudge. When multiplying the tens of thousands by four children. Imagine the number of people we'll have tomorrow filled with hatred. Do you know who are those who kill? Those without feelings? It's those who grew with hatred. When the parents of the 43 found five mass graves, with 30 bodies. I went there two months later. The stench was unbearable. Rotten. I cried there. Because it was... a kidnapping camp. I hear the words the 43 shout. Alive they took them! Alive we want them! And I get goosebumps. But if you go to the hills ... where I live, there's lots of buried people. So I think ... those words are meaningless in my hometown. This goes on. And it will go on. Because our society is indifferent. But if we start working, maybe tomorrow perhaps in 20 or 30 years things will get better. But if we cover our eyes as my mom suggests, don't greet, don't answer, don't look. Don't intervene when someone's being beaten. This will continue happening and growing. Genaro VÃ¡zquez Rojas, Your death was not in vain, The rifle you left we carry it with us IN TLAPA WE REMEMBER â€“ DEATH TO THE STATE Fascist government that kills students! Fascist government that kills students! Now it turns out the historic truth, presented by Murillo Karam, is just another hypothesis. It's clear they don't know how to clean their mess. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 ... 34, 35, 36, 37 ... 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 ... Justice! Alive they took them, alive we want them back. Alive they took them, alive we want them back.
