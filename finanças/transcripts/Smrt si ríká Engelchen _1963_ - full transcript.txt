From the Soviet Informbureau. The troops of the Ukrainian Front are continuing their offensive on both banks of the Morava River. A number of villages and towns have been liberated on 2nd May. Actively supported by the partisan brigade named after Jan Zizka, our forces have liberated the town of Zlin. To the right! This way! - Run. Hurry! Pavlusha, be careful. We're on our own. - Never mind. He mustn't get away. Is it far? - We're almost there. This is where Engelchen lives. - Go on. Stay here and watch. Swine. Pavlusha, watch out! Pavlusha... Pavlusha, what's the matter with you? Do you hear, it's me, Mitka. It's all right, you silly. Your leg is wounded, Pavlusha. Some hero you are, eh? Pavka... DEATH IS CALLED ENGELCHEN Based on the novel by Screenplay by Clear the way, folks, I'm bringing a wounded man. It's a partisan. He was in my loft. They shot him in the back. Stop staring and make way for a wounded hero! Art Director Make Up Artist Sound Film Editor Music by Produced by Director of Photography Directed by Whoa! Help me quick. He's still alive. Can you talk? He was shot in the back. He's a partisan. I want the best care for him, I'll pay for everything. My name is Kroupa. - Take him to the OR, nurse. Hey you, hurry up! Be careful, will you? I did all I could, now it's your turn. Count to thirty. One, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, eight, eleven, thirteen, fourteen... Marta, Marta. Marta! Marta! Miss Marta. Miss Marta! Engelchen! Halt, halt! What's the matter, Pavlusha? It's all right, I've seen it many times. your leg is wounded. It's all right, Pavlusha. Did you call me? I'm sister Elizabeth. Do you need anything? Is the light bothering you? Could you turn it off? Who did this? Who gave them away? They killed his brother-in-law and he still has the guts to come here. Aren't you ashamed?! You're to blame for their death! Why did you come? They could've lived if you hadn't come here. Good Lord, they could've lived. This didn't have to happen. Who was it? Damn it! Why are you silent, men? Go to hell! You've brought nothing but misfortune on us. What do you want here? Go away! That poor woman doesn't know what she's saying. Let me go. Let me go! A gendarme from Brod was with them. - From Brod? Buck up, men, or will you keep on whining? Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Amen. You keep screaming in your dreams. Who told you to listen? Who asked you? Go away. Go somewhere else! What's all this shindy! Don't spit on us, young man. Tell her to pray somewhere else! God Almighty is the most merciful. God Almighty never held a bazooka in his hand. Calm down. Cleanliness is half of health and Elizabeth is all. She is a true treasure. How are you feeling today, young man? This might cheer you up a little. You can see us and yourself better. Show me your tongue. Am I a cripple, doctor? You have a tough spine. I've never seen anything like it. The bullet slipped down the bone. Here it is. You can have it set into gold. Is that all you can tell me? I don't want to arouse false hopes in you, you're a grown man. You have a severe spinal cord concussion. - I was right after all. What did you expect, young man? By all accounts, you should have died. I should have. I'd be better off dead! Stop this nonsense, will you? I won't, understand? I don't want to end in a wheelchair. I don't want that nun to pray here. All I want is to die! So you think we've got no troubles at all, eh? That you are all alone here. Bring me an injection, nurse! A dose fit for a horse. I don't want an injection. Shut up. At least you won't bother me for another 12 hours. Please, nurse, don't give me the injection. Hero. Hero, hero, hero... Nikolai, Nikolai, Nikolai! Where's Nikolai? Nikolai! What's going on? The Germans. - Where? - Some 3 kilometres away. Alarm, quick. Alarm. They're coming. A marvellous view, isn't it? - Yes, Lieutenant. May I leave you for a moment, sir? - Of course. Where are cows, there has to be milk, don't you think? Hands up! Let's make it quick, we don't have much time. He has some sixty men, mostly recruits, three NCOs. They're a technical troop. They've started building a direction-finding station yesterday. If their pilots depend on this station, they won't fly much. very well, a radio station. Ask him whether his soldiers like him, whether he has authority with them. Do you have authority with your outfit? I believe I do. Yes. And what is his attitude to his soldiers? What is your attitude to your soldiers? The best. He says the best. In that case, tell him that the war will be over soon. Tell him that if he orders his outfit to surrender without a shot being fired, we will let them go. Translate. You can't be serious, Nikolai. - Translate it. You're out of your mind, Nikolai. You want to let the Germans go? Who is in command here?! - Five dozen Fritzes! You've heard what I said. I don't want to waste any more lives. Our lives, you see! They will fight to the last cartridge, understand? What did he say? - He doesn't trust us, he wants guarantees. Tell him that I'm a guards officer of the Soviet Army. - Understood? Lieutenant Kummer. The Germans... And me? What will you do with me? - He asks what will we do with him. We can't take any prisoners. We can't take any prisoners. I can't go back. Maybe if I could hide somewhere. He wants to hide somewhere. The Gestapo will get him and they'll force him to talk. You saw our base, you must die. We're sorry, but there's no other way. It's a hard choice. It's cruel. - Cruel it is. Who has to right to talk about cruelty here?! We did not invite you to come here. Look, it's our lieutenant. - Don't shoot, kamaraden. Don't shoot! - Sergeant! The lieutenant is coming back with a Russian. Sergeant, make sure nobody shoots. Don't shoot, kamaraden. We are surrounded. Don't try to shoot. Hands up! Calm down, calm down. Don't be afraid, you will all stay alive. Nobody will be harmed. Germans, we have made an agreement with your commander, Iisten to him. Speak. I assure you, men, that you needn't be afraid. Falcon 2, do you hear me, do you hear me... Hands up! Get away from it, bastard! I'll teach you a lesson, you swine. Soldiers, your commander wants to say farewell. Go ahead. Translate my thanks, please. - He thanks you. Strange people... Sergeant, assume command and order the men to line up. Yes, sir! Form up to report to the Lieutenant. Eyes left! Thank you. Good luck, youths. Good luck, Lieutenant! Germans, remember this day. And now - forward march! Sing! Sing! You are German soldiers, aren't you? Sing a song! Rose Marie. Three, four... - No! Sing something else. The Frail Bones Are Trembling. - The Frail Bones Are Trembling. Three, four... The frail bones of the world are trembling in the face of the great war. We have smashed this terror And it was a great victory for us. We should have killed them all. You have visitors. The children came to see you. I hope you don't mind but you were wounded in our town. And the children should... they want to meet their liberator. What do you want to show them? A monument? A hero or a cripple? Stop yelling, they're only children. Don't be afraid. Go on. Come here, give it to me. It's a nice day outside, isn't it? Do you play soccer? - Sometimes. You know how it is. It takes some time to get things going. I used to play soccer too. And what about you, would you like to be a partisan? How do you think a partisan looks? He has a submachine gun and shoots. Of course, what else should he have than a submachine gun. When a man has a submachine gun, he shoots. I beg you, do it quickly. But the Nazis had submachine guns too and lots of them, and they lost the war all the same. How is it then? It's complicated, isn't it? - Come. Believe me, I've never killed anyone. I command a technical troop. And what if you were assigned to the attack wave, what then? That's hard to say. Your German is good. Did you study it? During my three years of total deployment! I'm sorry. - I'm no longer there. May? - Of course. Well I never, the Buddenbrooks by Thomas Mann ... Do you know it? We didn't burn books. You're right. We let them take our basic rights. The right to think. Do you know Descartes' reasoning ''I think, therefore I am''? I translated it my way: ''As long as I think, I am human.'' And with such great ideals you got as far as here? Having a good chat, lads? Come here, Pavel. Take care of him. Why me, Nikolai? - Why not? You let the others go. They are fascists, understand? So this is it? Yes. Can I have a cigarette? - Go ahead. Do you want one? - Thanks. I think I'll have one after all. Pavel. Well? Halt! Take it, I won't have time to finish it. Doctor Weiss. Armin Weiss, Armin Weiss! A bloody Jew, eh? He too didn't have time to finish it. I know what you think. I've never met him. Shoot, please. Do you feel any pain? - No. - And now? - No. Now? - No. And do you feel this? - No. And this? - It's no use, doctor. I don't care. Don't wallow in it, young man. Your wound is nothing, what's inside is killing you. You need to talk. Get it all out or you won't walk again. Do you think walking would make feel any better? What do you mean? - It's not just my legs that's sick. You don't want to get better, do you? - I don't give a damn! In that case, go to hell, young man. I'm no use here. Instead of running after girls, he's whimpering like a sissy. Don't be angry with me. I need a girl. To push me around in a wheelchair. Don't apologize, you have the right to have all sorts of thoughts. But what if everyone harmed by war would want to die? By the way, I heard an interesting story yesterday. A small espionage group has operated in our factory since 1942. Right under the nose of the Nazis. A pretty woman was a member of the group. Nobody knows where she came from or what her name was. Some even say she was Jewish. She felt at home at the Gestapo and the people treated her accordingly. Can you imagine what nerves she must have had? She endured throughout the war. Finally, when it was all over, she committed suicide. Why are you telling me all this? One ought not lose one's head prematurely. Go away. Go away! Go. Damn it! Is it your daughter? Marta? She is my daughter. We don't see her often. Only since she came back from vienna after Hitler had come. She stayed home for a while and now she's at the factory. You talk too much. Go and feed the goats. Don't believe everything you hear. People are evil. I know what life she has. Good day. I know about you. Good day. Have you seen Nikolai, Mum? - He's waiting for you. Is something the matter, Nikolai? - Yes. Pavlusha, you will go to Brod. Do you understand? To Brod. The gendarme's name is Barta. You'll wrest out who liquidated our comrades in Leskovec. When? Right now? Thank you, Marta. Wait. You'll go today by train. He doesn't have to go by train, I've got my car here. Pavel is a swell lad, you can trust me on that. You will be absolutely safe with him. Pavlusha... Are you listening to me or not? Is it an order? - Yes, it is an order. Nikolai. - Yes? Could I go alone? By train? Why don't you want to go with her? What's going on? What's the matter with you? Come in. I didn't mean to. Why didn't you close the door? Come in, you innocent baby. Watch out or your eyes may fall out. What do you want? - Where's Mom? I need to iron my trousers. You seem in a hurry. - Don't bother. Where's the iron? Give them to me. You don't need to blush. - Why should I? You think I'm bad, don't you? If you like it. I do. What do you expect, Pavel? It's the war. You won't win the war on her ass. Am I supposed to wait for you? I wouldn't have much fun. It takes two. You're too proud. A village girl is not good enough for you. She smells of dung. - Shut up! You're an educated gent. You're not one of us. You only fancy town sissies. Stop talking claptrap. My goodness! It should've crossed my mind at once. He's getting all dressed up for Marta. And Jozina is stupid enough to iron his trousers. Get out! Run to her, you virgin boy! And you too! There's chocolate in the pocket next to you. Have you found it? Break a piece for me. Have some too. For the Wehrmacht only. The girl may have more value for us than our whole unit. Your passports, please. Everything is all right, you may continue. Who are you? A qualified secretary with a monthly wage. The whole house is full of Germans. Stay close. This way. We're safe now. Come. Who lives here? - Nobody. I stay here sometimes. The flat comes with the job. A nice trap. Could anyone come here? Are you scared? Or would you rather sleep in a barn? Maybe. There's nobody here. Really. You can take a bath. Hot or tepid? - There's no bath in Paseky. Why am I here? - You were given an order, weren't you? Why did you bring me here? Perhaps for a little illusion. Take it, you don't have to wear army boots here. This comes with the job too? Don't worry, nobody has ever worn it. Did you fall asleep? No, don't worry. - Dinner is ready. I'm coming. What are you staring at? There are still people in the world who don't know that evil times have come. And do you know? As far as food is concerned, I don't. Will you have a drink with me? It tastes like soap. - You don't know how to drink it. Cognac needs to be relished. By touching and smelling it. And with your tongue. What shall we drink to? That there is no war... Don't move or you'll knock something down. It seems we have a black hour. It's nicer this way. It reminds me of a fire in the woods. I've been attracted by it since a child. I always thought I wouldn't survive. That I'd burn like a night moth. I was terrified, but it was nice. They're over us. Would you like to listen to some record? Does this one suit the situation? Good Heavens! Don't take away my illusions. What illusions can you have? About what? About you, for example. What is so funny? I almost believed what the girls from Paseky say. What? Oh, you mean about me being a virgin. Damned Jozina, I'll give her a drubbing. Why? I like it. What do you like about it? That you're holding out. Everything is ersatz nowadays. What is it that you want? I like you. You like me. I see. Listen, I've seen a film once. In that film, they had a bathroom, and dinner with music. The dressing-gown accidentally opened. Are you wearing anything underneath? I got pretty excited then. I was a boy, but today, I like the lousy gin a thousand times more than your French cognac. Forgive me, I didn't mean it. I didn't wish to be alone with you because of this. It's my fault. I wanted to offer you all I had. It's the only way I know. It's the drill, Pavel. They trained me to become a whore. They say I'm of a better sort. Only I know that I'm from the worse. What about Paseky? What about your Mum and Nikolai? Don't ask. Marta. - Go away. Don't move, I'm aiming at your guts. You wouldn't dare. You're a gendarme, Barta, you know how it goes. Ripped bowels and six bullets in your stomach. Keep your hands up. Who sent you? - I'm here to ask questions, not you. I want the name of the man who betrayed our people in Leskovec. I don't know anything. It's Gestapo's business not ours. You were there. But the Germans new it sooner. What was I supposed to do? Who gave you the tip-off? I won't tell you anything, go away. - very well, I'll tell my commander that there was no nark, just an eager gendarme named Barta. Smile. Smile and greet them. They won't be here in a couple of weeks. What will you do then, Mr. Barta? I'm Czech just like you. I had to do it. I see you're beginning to understand. I'd like to pay, please! Don't do anything foolish. I'm here. - Two beers. Keep the change. I have a wife and children. You hanged a 1 4-year-old boy. What should I tell the commander? You bastard, you scoundrel, you blackmailer, I'd... - very well. Good bye. - Wait. It was Konecny. - Which one? There's more of them there. Cyril. Cyril Konecny. No, you mustn't do that. You won't get away, not this time. - No! You bastard, I'll kill you like a dog. Shoot him, but don't rack him. - You stay out of it. Have mercy. - Enjoy your death. You rat. Five people died because of you. No, it isn't true. Does death mean nothing to you! Cut it out. You're behaving Iike a sadist. You watch and you get up, swine. You'll die in your muck-heap. You've got two more minutes to pray. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us. Pray. I told you to pray! I am praying. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us, now and at the hour of our death. I didn't want that, it was him. He wanted it, he sent me, I didn't. He forced me, he threatened me. Wait! Who forced you? Who threatened you? He did! - Watch out! He won't tell us nothing now. - You saw it, he wanted to kill me. Sometimes, I'm sick of you. Well, young man, hold your hat, we're going down the hill. Carefully, nurse. Easy. What do you think? Doesn't the world seem bigger? At least you won't turn your back on us. You can even accept visitors. There. Come in, gentlemen, the patient is waiting. Here's our patient. Thank you, doctor. How are you? The head physician promised he would take care of you. I'm Kroupa. Don't you remember me? I got you out of trouble. Wait a moment. Do you know Mr. Kroupa? My name is vanek, I'm the chairman of the purgatory committee. Kroupa? Kroupa... - Kroupa. Kroupa Alois. Did you send me the bottle? Yes, I took the liberty... Could you give me the bottle, nurse? lt's not even worth mentioning. lt's pre-war, it won't give you a headache. Mr. Kroupa claims he saved your life. ls it true? I'd never ask anything of you, but people are so distrustful nowadays. lf he says so, it must be true. He did recognize me after all. Thank you, comrade. You were crying out ''make way for a hero'' or something like that. Who did you mean by that? - Well, not me of course. l meant you. - ln that case, we ought to celebrate it. Give me a glass, nurse. - lf you allow me... Nipper! l believe that wasn't necessary. l can't kick him in the ass, can l? l truly apologize. lt's such a horrible smell. - Why are you apologizing? For bringing him here. I disliked the way he kept using you. You can't even imagine what trouble some of your boys caused us. They'll sign anything to anyone. You can't blame them for getting confused, can you? All depends on you now. - I know. But how are we to keep up? There's not enough good people, while swindlers like Kroupa are swarming. - Did you expect it would be easy? Easy? We're not concerned about that. Don't let it trouble you, though, it will get better. Good bye. Get well soon. Good bye. lf only we had enough people. You've done a fine mess indeed. I've heard you want to exterminate quislings in our hospital, is that so? Can I smoke here, doctor? No, of course not. Would you like to smoke? As long as the doctor doesn't see you. Anything else? l was wondering whether you could get me a radio. As you wish. I'd shower favours upon you, young man. Nurse, where's our radio? You have more advertisements than Bata. - It's not for free. Just in case, we've never met. l just gave you a ride. Don't worry. As soon as I get to the factory, I'll look after myself. Damn it, wait! Turn around! - Are you insane, now? A complete jagdkommando. You'll be quite hot in the mountains. The beasts send shivers down my spine. You surely set their teeth on edge. Let's go. COMMlSSlONER FOR THE ARMS lNDUSTRY Wait a moment, please. Yes, please? - Good day. - What can I do for you? l need to have this signed. lt's a factory pass. - Construction timber? Just a moment. She's a bitch. - Do you know her? Of course I do, she sleeps with officers. When the war is over, I'll personally cut off her red bun. You can rely on me, Major. Yes, I will leave at once. Here you are. - Thank you. Good day. ls everything all right, Andulka? - Yes, madam. Make the table ready for four o'clock. l live on the left. Come in. lt's always the darkest under a candle. Nobody would ever look for you here. ls it why you brought me here? Yes, it was one of the reasons. Do you mind if I change? I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry. l have to get ready for a performance. Everything is all right, he's from Paseky. The patrols are all over the town. He has to spend the night here. The house will be guarded by the SS from tomorrow. lt has a back door, though, Marta will show you. l see. Who was that? Make yourself comfortable. Cognac is in the bar. Cigarettes are on the table. Make yourself at home. ls it a private ball? - No, an official visit. Of the Jagdkommando Commander. - Who? Bizarre, isn't it? - I probably lack a sense of humour. Moreover, his name is Engelchen. What? - You heard well. Sturmbannfuehrer Engelchen. The angel has done quite a lot of work. ln Poland, Yugoslavia, the Ukraine. And he used to be a violin maker from Klingenthal. He asked me whether I would mind if he stayed at the villa. He's so considerate. Unbearably accurate. Come and have a look, Pavel. The tall one is to command the action against you. That's Engelchen. I'm not going there. I don't want to. - Marta. - I don't want to. You have to overcome it. It will be all over in a couple of weeks. It will be over. For whom? Me? Everyone will take off their hats to you. Forgive me for being vulgar but medals aren't usually awarded for sleeping with the enemy. I don't know when I'll come back. Probably late. You'll have to make the bed yourself. Don't wait for me. Sleep tight. I'll wake you up when I come back. Were you affectionate to her? I don't know. I tried. You should have been more affectionate. One doesn't always do what he wants. Why weren't you affectionate? You'd have to know the whole story. I don't want to know. I don't want to hear more. About a fortnight before I came to Zlin, Marta showed up in Paseky in the middle of the night. Pavlusha, get up. What's the matter? Wake up the fellows. We're leaving in half an hour. Is it an attack? - Take axes and saws. Marta, what happened? What's the matter with you? When will it end? When will it... - Calm her down, mamusha. Don't let her leave the house before morning. Poor Marta. It isn't good. Let's go. - Get moving. But gentlemen... Look, Nikolai, it's a general. Hands down. I protest, as a general I want to speak to a military officer. What did he say? - Nikolai, wait! The general is mine. Miss Marta, what are you doing? Do you still know me? - Miss Marta. You pig, you lecherous bastard! You swine, you pervert! What are you doing? Marta! Stop it! Swine, swine, swine! - Marta! Pull yourself together, Martha. Pavel! Look, he beat me like a dog. With his whip. Kill them. Kill them all! Ondrusha! Shoot them all! Such things could not have happened. Of course they didn't, I've made it all up. Do you want to hear more? - No, you mustn't talk, you must sleep now. Hold me. We found a complete retreat plan in the general's briefcase. It was a lucky day for us after all. I'll turn off the light now and I won't leave until you fall asleep. What made you put on the habit, sister? You're starting again. What were you running from? I told you to go to sleep. I don't think I will ever believe how much can one bear. You're back already? Is something wrong? Nothing. And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid and turned himself: and behold, a woman lay at his feet. And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid. Spread therefore thy skirt over me to make me warm else I shall disappear. Ruth. Marta, if you want, we can stay together after the war, forever. Pavel! At this moment, all cities in the world beat as one heart, Moscow, Paris, London, New York, Amsterdam and Prague. Everywhere, a single word thunders in the air - peace. A festive dinner for you. Aren't you happy? If you only saw what's happening outside. What are you doing here? You had a morning shift. Everyone is celebrating and someone has to stay here. I imagined this day all the war, how bells would be tolling. Are they tolling? - No. I also imagined how all shop-windows and all the town would be lit up. Why is it so dark outside? There's not enough power, but there'll be fireworks soon. It always turns out differently. What about you, sister? - Me? You ought wear something else. You managed to survive. A blue dress would become you. You should do something you've never done before. Get drunk or dance cancan. Throw yourself into the hands of the first man you meet and make love. Why are you so sad? This is night of nights, anything is allowed tonight. Anything! You shouldn't have said that. You shouldn't have said that! Ready. Ready. I ask you for the last time. Did you want to join the partisans or not? You idiot! Do you know what ''take the hook'' means? Will you speak or not? Pig! You're such a pig. It's not funny. Untie him. What a nerve-racking situation! I almost believed I butted into Germans and it wasn't a nice feeling at all. I know, sorry about that. But we can't accept just anyone. It's stands to reason. You wouldn't fool a real spy, though. You're good at playing the Krauts, except for one thing. I've been here for almost an hour and you haven't hit me, not once. There's a few more questions. Answer quickly, without thinking. Why do you want to join us now when the war is almost over? I have no choice. They issued a warrant to arrest me. Who told you we're here? Why every child knows! - That we're here? - No that. I just knew I had to come across somebody in the woods and I did. I met those two. - Where did you get the Mauser? Mauser? Oh, you mean the pistol. The Gestapo man who escorted me was killed by kettlesmiths. I took it from his case. - Why were you arrested by the Gestapo? For black marketeering. I manage a skin storehouse. - A sort of a saboteur, eh? Nonsense. Everybody sells what they can. And I could. What pistols does the Gestapo have now, what systems? What is it with you? Maybe this one. Tell him that's rubbish! What is the difference between a Mauser and a Parabellum? I've never held a pistol in my hand. - You should know. The army has Mausers and the Gestapo has Parabellums. Thanks for explaining. It's good to learn something new. Don't be cocky. I'm just answering your questions. What can you tell us to make us believe you? You don't believe me? - We don't. That I got away? That I got arrested by the Gestapo? - Anybody could say that. Can you give us facts? What about the warrant or the escort sheet? I can make millions of such papers. - What proof do you want? Is this enough? And this? Should I take my shoes off? And would you like to see my ass? Why didn't you tell us right away? - Nobody asked me. It's all right, Mach, it's all right. We're just vigilant, understand? We cannot afford to be caught off guard. I counted on that. Wait outside. Can't you see he's playing with us? Calm down, Pavlusha. In such a situation, people usually tell lies or fabricate stories, but not him. He's telling the truth to a certain extent. Now why would he do that? Why? For money? It's worthless. Out of hate? Against whom? You don't know what the occupation did to the people. Listen, Pavlusha. Nobody would get beaten like a dog just to play a double game. Understand? - And Marta? Leave her out. She knows what she's doing. very well. If you honestly think he's an agent, take it and shoot him. Take it. I'm giving you the right to do it. See? You're a fool. Was he a traitor or not? Don't tease me. Was he? But why did he do it? Who knows. He had to have some reason. In the war? Hello, Nikolai. Mach! What are you doing here? Tonda. You know him? - You bet I do. He's from my village, from Leskovec. - Wait. Do you know him well? - He lived three houses from me. You will answer for him. - I understand. Jozina, a clean cup for Nikolai. They can hear you as far as Berlin. Can somebody close the windows? One might think they captured Hitler. Aren't two trucks with ammo enough? Wait, let me show you something. How many notches do you have? Three. - Too little. And you? Six. - That's better. You become a partisan only after taking down four Fritzes. Jozina should cut notches. She'd need an extra butt. What about you, Mitya, how many notches do you have? Well. How many? Four, three, two, one? None. Shut up! I simply can't. Mitya is useful even without notches. He ought to try it with this. There was a full crate of them. Get lost with it. - Easy, easy. It's a new type. Good equipment. The seal is missing. Good equipment. Give me an automatic gun. At least I know what I'm holding. Are you scared? Here. Just imagine an armoured car that you need to destroy. What would you do with your automatic gun, eh? Come here, Pavlusha. What does it say here? Shake before use and wash yourself after use. Quiet! After lifting the visor, release the safety-catch. This is the safety-catch and that's the trigger. The trigger, I know, and what's this? Warning: Fire is released from the barrel after firing. - I see. I'll show you how to handle it, fellows. Make sure that nobody stands behind you or he'll be fried like a crackling. Mitya, give us a concert. I can't, somebody stole my balalaika. Welcome the song and dance ensemble from Kiev. The head of the ensemble is Private Dimitriy Akakievich Cvestakov. The conductor is Major Dimitriy Akakievich Cvestakov. And the soloist is... - General Mitya. Hurrah! Quiet! We will open our programme with a Czech folk song called ''Bet with Me, Lass''. Nikolai, Nikolai! What happened? That son of a...! Don't, let go! Don't be foolish! For Chrissake! You do it. You do it. What's with Nikolai? Don't just stand here! Put out the fire! Tonda! What are you doing here? Where's Mach? Where is he? I'm helping with the fire. - Why do you care?! Where's Mach? Where is he? He was with me a minute ago. - Where? - Over there. Who did this? Who gave them away? It was Cyril Konecny. It wasn't me, It was him. He sent me, he forced me. Who forced you? Who threatened you? He won't tell us nothing now. You bet I do. He's from my village, from Leskovec. If you honestly think he's an agent, shoot him. Are you scared? Here. Where's Mach? Where is he? Mach! Mach! This is how you watch him? Bastard! There are enough dead. How careless! It had to be obvious to everyone that he was a nark. Everything is obvious only in history books. But when you live it, you make mistakes. The worst thing is you make mistakes whether you do it one way or the other. After all, it is human to make mistakes. It is inhuman only when... When people are at stake. Andryusha, come here. Is everything clear? We'll leave a trace behind for the jagdkommando to follow us and allow other units to attack the passes. Precisely. Show us what a commander you are. And you, Pavel, keep an eye on him. Good luck. Good luck, fellows. It seems they've condemned us. And who condemned them? Do you want to defend Paseky with twenty men? They'll be better of without us. - Dragging your heels, eh? It's still war, isn't it? Bundle away. Jozina! Farewell, Mother. Sonny, to think I couldn't bear you. What will become of us? What will happen to us now? The nights are cold. Thank you. Thank you for everything. Wait! Wait! Wait. Jozina, come back, you dowdy. Take me with you, fellows. Shame on you! lf you go, don't come back, whore! Go home, Jozina, go home. - Leave me alone! We're here. I found this place long ago. What do you think? I'm thirsty. Can I get a gulp? - Hang on. It's great. They have to crawl into the trap whether they like it or not. Let's hope they take the bait. - Do you want to bet? I guarantee they'll come storming through the valley. They'll think we're still an hour ahead of them. They'll stop under the rock and find out our tracks are splitting. They'll take some time to think, but as soon as they scent blood, they'll go on and it will be too late for them. Like a shooting-gallery at a fair. Just like I always wanted. You should've joined the carousel folk. - You have no imagination, son. Deserters. - So what? They're Germans. - Wait! They don't want to fight. Hey, you! Wake up! Get up! Bandits! We're deserters. Partisans are good. - Yes, good. Hitler is kaput. - Yes. I'll show you how good are partisans! - Wait. Let's listen to them first. What do you want to do with us? Are you hungry? We haven't eaten anything for 3 days. They haven't eaten for 3 days. Here you are! Look at them conquerors! Find out all you can. Be quick. Let's go. Not so fast. It could make you sick. We've been on the road for a fortnight. Put the machine gun here and the Bren over the water. You will position yourselves on the rocks and fire at my signal. Clear? All clear. They're on the road for a fortnight, from Slovakia. Three were killed by field gendarmes. They're fed up with the war. A bit late. We should shoot you, but your field gendarmes will take care of that. Ask them what they plan to do. What did he say? Take us come with you. Tell him. - What did he say? Andryusha! Prepare for combat. They're coming. Down! - Down! Keep an eye on them. That's him. - Who? - He's in command of the action. His name is... I can't recall his name. Seelchen or Engelchen. Give it to me. - Engelchen. Dogs. Shoot at the dogs first. First the dogs. The dogs, the dogs first. Shoot the dogs. Fire, fellows! It's stuck, damn it! Hurry up! - I'm trying. Come, Willy, come! You got him! Finish him! Swine. Hey! Come here! Everybody! Nurse, sister Elizabeth! It moved. My left big toe. It moved. What's all the fuss about? Why are you causing panic, young man? - It moved. It moved. The big toe on my left foot. You don't suffer from occasional hallucinations, do you? No, I swear. Doctor, I'm not lying. Try it, please. I saw it, doctor. Nurse. Let us have a look then. Do you feel anything? - No. - And here? - No. Here? - No. - And now? - Yes! Ouch! Yes, right there. - Don't make fun of me, young man. I'm not making fun, doctor. Really, it felt like a thousand needles in my head. Let's try it once more. Here? - No. No. Ouch. It hurts. Right there! Not there. Where you pricked me before. That's where it itches! Prick me more. Ouch! It hurts! Run, Germans! I roasted you like a shashlik! Come on, Germans. Come here, you cowards. Go to hell! Who allowed you to do this, eh? What do you want? They are the SS. Leave them alone. Good work, Germans. Good work. - They deserve a gun. Don't you understand? Damn it! On the same line yesterday and today they shoot them?! I'd shoot my own brother if it were to make this bloody war shorter. They're after us. Hold on, fellows, hold on. We'll have a rest as soon as we get on the other side. It's Engelchen again. There's one more option. We could get away along the range. Retreat. We're retreating. Leave us alone. Don't do anything foolish, Martin. - Go. I've been running 3,000 kilometres. I've had enough. Go. Were you ever on a hunt? At least you know how a rabbit feels. They were good legs, doctor. Were? They will be. Stop thinking about the past, young man. It's not that easy. You can't cut it out like a bullet from my back. It doesn't hurt that much any more. - What doesn't hurt? The past. - Really? Splendid. Grab the bar. You're making fun of me but I don't mind. Hold the bar or you could fall. I want to tell you something. I couldn't tell you a week ago, I didn't know it then. There's no need to play games, doctor. We know each other well. Listen, what's the name of the girl... You're yelling her name in your dreams. - Leave Marta alone. Yes, Marta. Well, that Marta of yours is alive. Ondra... Ondra, Ondra. What's up? They're close. They're surrounding us. Don't worry, they wouldn't dare into the mountains at night. Do you want to change now? - No. Wake me up in an hour. Halt! Halt! On guard you are indeed! - I could have shot you?! - You were sleeping. Today or tomorrow, I don't care. I'm not sleepy. - You're a diehard. I'll be on guard with you. At least you won't fall asleep. Can you make me warm a little? You're hot as a stove. If you want, we could... - I can't. I'm on guard. And if you weren't on guard? You're too proud, Pavel. - I'm not proud. But I'm not an animal. I felt sorry for you. I didn't want you to be so alone. You know what I mean. We're such fools, Jozina. Such fools. Marta... Marta. Good Heavens! Marta. I didn't mean to wake you up, Pavel. I just wanted to see you. I changed, haven't I? I was very ill. I spoke to the doctor. He said you'd get well soon. What day is it today? Friday. Come closer. Sit down. What's the matter with you? - Nothing. Nothing. You smell wonderfully. Pavel. I came to say goodbye. I'm leaving. - Where? I'm going somewhere where nobody knows me. Anywhere. - I don't understand. Why? I have no one here. Anyone can spit on me. - What about me? Even you may call me a whore one day. - Don't! No. I know you wouldn't. But I'd always be afraid you would. I'm all alone like you, Marta. We only have each other. No. You're better off than me. You'll walk again. Live, but me... I'll always be a cripple. You know I can't be without you. - You can. It was the war. You know it's true. Won't you kiss me goodbye? Don't make it harder, Pavel. I have to go. It's the only way I can keep you to myself. A car is waiting for me. - You mustn't go! I can't keep them waiting. - Send them away! - Yes, I will. I know you won't come back. - I will come back! Elizabeth, don't let her go! Stop her, damn it! Don't sit! Don't sit down! When you sit down, you won't get up. Get up! Nine dead. Fellows... I can't go on. I don't even know where we are. It's no use. We have to surrender. What did you say? You son of a bitch! Don't talk rubbish! You're the commander! Lead us. Or I'll rip your heart out! Let's get going. Get moving. Come on! You still haven't got us, Engelchen. What? What do you think? - Good work, Pavlusha. Great! Don't be shy, Elizabeth. You see? I told you. You mustn't overdo it. Take a short rest. I'll be right back. That's all. Well, we saw each other and chatted. It's time for me to go. Where? - Where? Home. Farewell, Pavlusha. Take it. What a pretty girl! Don't you think we've already been here before, fellows? Four days ago. Here it all began. And it will end here. Come here, coward. Come down, Engelchen. We're here! Come on! We won't give up that easily! Give it to me! - You're wasting our ammo! We don't have enough. Everybody must save one shot for himself. In case I can't do it myself, will you... Understand? So we lay in waiting. For our last struggle. Fourteen exhausted men, two machine guns, and 500 cartridges. What? - Shh! Do you hear? Do you hear the silence? You don't? What's going on? What do you want? - The German has gone insane. Gentlemen! Listen. Down! Down, you fool! The war is over. - Shut up, idiot! Let him go. Are you all insane? It's over. Can't you see? This is the end. I know them. They vanished. They're gone. Shut up! Fellows, he's right. They're gone. It's over, over! Fellows! What is it? Stop! They burnt it down. Quiet! Speak! - They burnt it down. The village. Paseky. I see you already know. (HIROSHIMA) While you were gleaning the field, they did it in bulk. And we are trying to cure colds and people like you. One hundred thousand dead. All the days and weeks, I've been lying here, listening to the radio. I heard of the losses in this war, the 30,000 dead and wounded every day, and I've been saying to myself that if we did nothing else up in the hills than to make this bloody war shorter by a single day, it was worth it. What am I supposed to say now? What sense does it all have? Sense? Perhaps it means an end to all wars. And Engelchen is living somewhere quite happily. They tied them up. Bound them in chains and nailed the door. In the end, they used flame throwers. While we idiots yelled hurrah. Do whatever you want with me, just don't torture me. Look. Look, German. Our Father, who art in heaven... Mother. Mother! I beg you to forgive me. Forgive me, forgive me. May the Lord forgive you, boys. Here's the package I promised to bring. Watch out, a car is coming! Mother! Mother. Pavel! I had to run some errands in town. So I thought I'd call on you. It's so hard to get anything nowadays. They promised to give me cement. - Cement? Yes. You're walking? Show me. Show me how. very well. Are they looking after you well? Is there anything you need? I've brought you this. Thank you. All is going well. We've got plenty of work. Nothing doing. Life must go on. What about her? Did she see you? - She did and she left. Good Lord. She suffered so much. I should be going. There's only one bus. Get well, son. When you walk better, come see us. Will you come? Come. Of course I will, Mother. Good bye, Pavel. Nurse. Nurse! What's the matter? Why didn't you knock? Give me my clothes. - What clothes? My things, clothes. Civilian. Why are you looking at me like that? I want clothes, I'm leaving. Does the doctor know? Tell him yourself. Put it back. You can't come and leave the hospital whenever you please. I only want my things. I'm leaving. I decide when you leave. - I'm leaving today. Don't you dare! You silly fool. I respect you greatly, doctor. But if you don't let me go, I'll run away in this. I suppose I have to chin you one. What do you think, nurse? Doctor... - I see, you've plotted against me. Or do you want to get rid of that lunatic? He knows why he is leaving, doctor. He has to go. In that case, I won't keep you. Give him his partisan apparel. Thank you, doctor. - For what? You deserve better patients. You didn't have to hurry because of that. I have to find someone. Maybe you knew him too. They called him Engelchen. Do you understand what I mean? Go and don't come back. Only for a cup of coffee. Do you know what Engelchen means?
