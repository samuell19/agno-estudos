- Shark got you. - Are you serious? Look what you did. I'll get you a new one. Can we please do something? I'm so bored. I could just lie in the sun all day. No, I'm gonna go back to the room. I told Stuart I'd give him a call. Bring me a drink back. Thank you. - Yeah, you wish. - Nice ass. I want to make a toast. Come on! Thank you so much for bringing me on vacation. It's gonna be the best time ever. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Thanks for coming. - Stuart is missing out. - I'm way more fun anyway. - You are. Yeah. Lisa? Lisa? Sis? Hey. What are you doing? What's wrong? I lied. What are you talking about? I lied about why Stuart isn't on this trip. - What? - He's not working. What do you mean? He left me, Kate. He broke up with me. Oh, my God. - Why didn't you tell me? - 'Cause I was embarrassed. Do Mom and Dad know? The one good thing in my life, I managed to fuck up. What happened? It's my fault. He got bored. - He actually said that? - Yeah. Kind of, more or less. And then I thought if I came on this trip and I came away with you, and I had fun and I showed that I could be fun, somehow he would come back, but... Come on. - What? - Come on, we have to get dressed. - For what? - You and I are going out. Going out where? It's 1:0Ø in the morning. Lisa, it's Mexico. You and I are the only ones who aren't out. Come on. I've been dying to do this all week. This is the best night ever. Oh, I could be here all night! That is crazy. You guys are insane. Seriously, you have to try. We do it almost every weekend. It's amazing. Yeah, yeah. Look, 25-foot great white sharks. They come right up to your cage. - Twenty-five foot? - You have never seen anything like it. How much does it cost? What? Bueno. It's like $100 each. We-we know Taylor. He's like a friend of ours. - Great. - Uh, mmm... I don't know. What are you gonna do, sit by the pool all day long? - Seriously? - I-I don't even know how to dive. I will teach you everything you need to know. But I need one of those, like, diving card certification. - You took that whole class! - Okay, okay, look, look. This is Mexico okay? It's not even diving. You're gonna be in a cage. You're only down five minutes. - It's totally safe. - Exactly. It's like you're going to the zoo, except you're in the cage. - Yeah, and... and underwater. - Sí. Come on, it sounds amazing. Please? I don't know. You could just think of the photos. I mean, they won't be the type of photos that a boring person would take. Just saying. She's got a good point. - Think of the photos. - Think of the photos. Okay. - All right. - Okay. - Cheers. - Salud. Salud. Well, good, I am pleased. Yeah, I just wanted to say I had a really good night tonight. Me, too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Sorry. Not... ready. Thank you. - No, it's okay. It's fine. - See you tomorrow. - Tomorrow for sure. - Come on. Oh. - Good night! - Buenas noches. Adios. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Sí. Adios. Buenas noches. They are so cute. Oh, cute. Hey. Hola. I am so looking forward to this. It's gonna be amazing. I can't believe you talked me into this. I did not talk you into this. Okay, you just wanted to see the guys again. I did not. Do not lie to me. Okay, he's kind of cute. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Kate, I don't know about this. - It'll be fun. I promise. It... they're probably not going to show anyway, so... - Hola, chicas! - Hey! - Hey, hola! - How's it going? - Hola. - Hi. - Hola. - Hey, how are you? I'm so glad you came. I wasn't sure you were going to. Yep, here we are. Okay, should we do it? - Yeah, let's go see the boat. - Okay. - Go ahead... - Oh, you lead the way. Okay. - So, uh, how did you sleep? - Uh, I slept all right. - I had a really good time last night. - Me, too. You guys are funny. - How is your head? - Uh, it hurts. Okay. All right, we're gonna go talk to the captain. Be back in a second. Okay. I... really, I feel super uneasy about this. - Come on, it'll be fine. - I mean, is this even safe? We don't know anything about these people. Remember what the concierge said? That we should book all activities and tours... Yeah, he works for the hotel. He has to say that. I've just heard horror stories about tourists going on these shady trips. - And Stuart even told me that... - Stuart is a prick, Lisa. It'll be fun. Come on. Hey, come on over. Don't be shy. - Come on. - Okay. This is, uh, Taylor, the captain. - Hola. Hola. - Hola. Buenos días. ¿Cómo están? - Bien. - Bien. You both know how to scuba dive, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. All right, well, welcome aboard. Okay. Ah, gracias. I know you're clumsy, so don't fall in, okay? There she is. Oye, Javi. Watch your step. Here we are. Gracias. Okay. Oh, no. - Here... - Kate, have you seen the cage? Put those tanks in the back, keep them out of the sun. Relax. You're gonna have the time of your life, I promise. It'll be fun! I'm scared. This looks like the spot. - All right. - This is it? - Yeah. - This is totally it. Really? This is going to be amazing. It's feeding time. - You hungry? Huh? - Ugh, it's disgusting. - No. - Hmm? No? - You hungry? Huh? - Oh. Oh, my God, gross. - Ah. - There we go, feeding time. That's so gross. That reeks, huh? I thought it was illegal to chum the water. - Uh... - You think I should call the shark instead? Mr. Shark! Hello! I don't think they hear so good underwater. Yeah, they just put that down... - What-what did he say? - ...so the sharks will smell it. - No, nothing. - They should be here soon. - We should get this party started. - Okay. Here, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy. That works? Okay. There! Look! - Where? - There, there... - Oh, yeah. - Oh, my God! - Got to check this out. Javier. - Javi. Oh, my God, this is amazing. - See, right over there. - Lisa? - Should we get ready? - Javi! Lisa, you in there? Come on. There's a shark right by the boat. The boys are in first, but we got to get ready in a minute. No. I don't think I can do it. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - What? No. - No, no, please. - Don't be mad at me. - I can't, I ca-I can't. - Come on, it'll be incredible. Please, please, please, please. You know, you're not gonna make Stuart jealous with photos inside the boat's bathroom. - Really? - Well, I had to say it. I did. Come on. Please. - Ah, yes. Yes, I love you. - Okay, okay, okay. - Okay, come on. - Oh, God, you owe me. Yes, I will make you breakfast in bed. - Yeah, you owe me big time. - Scrambled eggs... I will, I promise. That's it. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Let's lower the cage. Be careful. Oh, my God, that looks so scary. - Okay. Bye. - Don't leave me hanging. Bueno, Javi. See, look, it's safe. It's fine. Have fun, boys. Whoa, don't slip. Bye. Okay. Come here. There. - Oh, my God. - It's huge. Oh, my God, Kate. It's about 20 feet. I've seen them get as big as 28. - We're really gonna do that? - Yes! Yeah, let's get you suited up now. I'm really nervous. - You are? - Mm-hmm. I'm shitting bricks. - Really? - Yes. - You are? - Yes. Hey, help me. Does my butt at least look cute in this? Oye. You ladies ready? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yup. Okay. Oh, God. Relax. - Okay. Okay. - Okay? All right. - Calm down. - Okay. - Yeah, I'm okay. - Good. - That's it. - Okay. Here, hold on to that. There you go. - Now... - Put these down? Uh-huh. Check your air. You should both have 20Ø bar. Yeah, 200. - That's your air. - Okay. When it gets to 100, you need to let me know. When it gets to 50, I'm gonna bring you back up. Fifty is the orange. - Yes. - Yeah, okay. Yeah, I know that, yeah. - That's it. - Right, okay. All right, you're only gonna be going down about five meters. It's unlikely at that depth, but... If you get any pain in your ears, you just need to equalize. Tilt you head back and swallow. - Equalize. - Okay. - Head back, swallow. - Okay. Yeah. All right, now just remember, the faster you breathe, the faster you use up your air. - Relax. Tranquilo, okay? - Okay. Trust me, once you're down there, you're not gonna want to come back up. - Right. - Great. - Good? - Okay. - Awesome, all right. - Yeah, I can do this. Okay. Okay. It's great. You're gonna love it down there. Gracias. Gracias, Javi. Next? - That's it. - I'm so scared. Be careful. Shark don't hear so good up here, you know? Underwater? You're in his world. Can hear your heartbeat for up to five miles away. Can sense if you're frightened or weak. Track you down. Good to go! Don't pay any attention to that pendejo. You're going to have a great time. Can I borrow your camera? Yeah, but... ...if you drop it, you got to go down and get it. What are we doing, Kate? Smile. - Adios, muchachas! - Okay. - I'm really scared. - I'm going to go first, okay? Oh, I'm so excited. Okay. All right. You're next. - That's it. - Uh-huh. Right. Oh, Kate. You can see for miles. Kate, look at the fish. Do you see all the fish? It's so much better than sitting in a hotel room, right? Oh, wow. This is awesome. I had no idea. Can you girls hear me? - Yeah. - Yes. - Lisa, how you doing? - I'm good, actually. - Kate, how about you? - Yeah, I'm good. - I can't see any sharks, though. - All right, well, just be patient. We're gonna add a little bit more chum to the water now. Okay. Oh, wow. It kind of takes your breath away. How deep do you think it goes? I have no idea. Wave to the camera. Cheese! Hi! Hi. Oh, wow. Can you take a picture of me? - Yeah. - Wait. Oh! Oh, shit. Sorry. Sorry. Oh, my God, the guys are going to be so pissed. You've got to go and get that. Oh, my God! That is, like, the biggest shark! This is amazing. There's another one. - Oh, my God, he's huge. - Oh, my God, look at those teeth. I can't believe how close they are. - I dare you to touch him. - Are you crazy? Well, he definitely likes to look at you. Did you feel that? The cage just moved. I thought we were gonna drop for a second. Are you girls okay? No, I think the cage just dropped a little bit. No, no, it's the winch mechanism. It's-it's fine. It just slipped a little bit. Uh, no, I think we would like to come back up now. No, no, no, no. We don't. I'm sure it's nothing. - We're fine, okay? - Are you crazy? No, we would like to come back up now, please. All right, listen. Standby. We're going to bring you girls back up. - Come on! - Javi, ¿estás seguras? - Sorry. - Lisa, come on. I just don't feel safe in this cage. - At least we got to see some sharks. - I mean, I guess so. It's just so cool. I could stay down here forever. Hey, Taylor, once Lisa's out, can I go back down again? What...? Taylor, we're sinking! We're sinking! - Help us, guys! - Taylor, help! I have to get out of here! Taylor, help us! Taylor! Lisa. Oh, my God. Wake up. Wake up. Lisa, please wake up. Please. Wake up, wake up. Lisa, please, wake up. Lis. - No, no, no, no! - No, no. Taylor! Taylor, help us! - We're stuck here at the bottom! - Lisa, you need to calm down. - We need to get out of here! - If you do not calm down, we will die here! Look at me now! - Stop! Stop! - Kate, I can't breathe. - Oh, I can't breathe. - Slow your breathing. - I can't breathe. - Please, please, please. Slow your breathing. In. Out. In. Out. Come on. Good, good. The more you panic, the faster you use up your air, okay? I need you to slow down your breathing. Okay, good. How deep are we? Forty-seven meters. We must've ripped the crane right off the boat. What are we gonna do? Listen! Can you hear that? Taylor? Taylor? Help us! Hello! Taylor? - Taylor! Taylor! - Wait, wait, wait. Stop. We must be just out of range to... We've gotta try and get back in contact with them. How? We can almost hear them, right? So-so maybe we're just a bit too deep. Maybe... maybe if I swim up a tiny bit, then-then we'll be back in range, okay? I could tell them that we're alive, and they need to come and get us. Yeah, but what about the sharks? They can sense us down here, right? I'll swim as close to the cage as I can. I'll be okay. No, no, no, please, Kate. Promise me you won't leave me down here. I won't leave you, I promise. I promise. Oh, shit. - It's stuck. - No, it's not. We can get it. We can do it! Push! We're not gonna get out through this side. Yes, we are. Yes, we are. I can get it. Just give me a second. Okay. I think I can get out through these bars. I need to take my tank off, though. Wait, what?! Is that even safe? It's going to be okay. You can pass it to me when I'm through. That gap looks really small. Do you think you could even make it? Take my BCD, okay? Okay. - I need you to watch out for me. - Please, be careful. Okay. I got this. Okay. Okay. I'm okay. Kate, come on, you can get this. Come on, push! Push, Kate. You got it. What are we going to do, Kate? What are we going to do? I'm gonna have to take my mask off, okay? - No. No, no, no. No, no, no. - It's fine. Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, there has to be some other way. No, just stop, just stop and think for a second. - You have to calm down. - No, no. Kate, you can't take off your mask. - Lisa, calm down! Stop. - No, I can't. - I can't. - Please. I'm gonna take some deep breaths, I'm gonna take it off, and go through and you're gonna pass it right to me, okay? What if you can't get it back on again? You'll drown. It's okay. All right, you ready? Here, take the mask! Here, put this on, quick. Come on, put it on quick. Hurry up. Hurry. Hurry, hurry, hurry, please. Before I make contact, I'm gonna move the crane. Just in case you need to get out and I'm not here, okay? Please don't say that, Kate. We're going to get out of this together. Just keep a look out, okay? It's not moving. I'm going to go see if it's stuck at the base. Kate, I'm scared. What if the sharks come? It's caught against the rocks. I think that I can move it. Okay, but hurry, please. Come on, Kate. I think I have it free. - Oh, come on. Come on. - Come on, Kate. Push. You got it, you got it. It's moving. Keep going. Yes! We did it! I'm gonna see if I can reach Taylor. We're gonna get out of here, okay? Hurry, please. Taylor, can you hear me? Is anybody there? Somebody please answer me! Hello! Kate! - I can hear you! - I said, can you hear me? Say something. I can hear you, Taylor, it's Kate, it's Kate! - Hello? - I hear you. - I read you loud and clear, Kate. - Oh, thank God. Oh, you have to help us. - Are you both okay? - Yes. - Good. - Yes. - How much air do you have in your tank? - Um... I'm at 55 bar. - What does your depth gauge say? - Um, the gauge is at 47 meters. I had to come up to hear you, I'm at 40 meters. I'm am so freaking scared. What do I do? All right, listen, Kate. I need you to get back in the cage immediately. It's the only safe place from the sharks. Do you understand? Javier's coming down to you now. He's going to hook up the cage to our spare winch and pull you up. - Okay. - And remember, Kate, whatever you and Lisa do, don't try to race to the surface. - You'll get the bends. - I'm going back down now. Promise me you'll come. Just stay in the cage and reserve your air. Okay. Just keep calm. Just keep breathing. I made contact with them, Lisa. I made contact. Yeah? Yeah? What did they say? Javier is coming down. He's gonna connect the cage - to a backup winch. - He is? Oh! Thank God, thank God, thank God. Oh, okay. Oh, thank God. - We need to conserve our air. - Okay. Okay. Oh, it's almost over. I was so frightened, Kate, waiting for you. I thought that you were never coming back. I'm so sorry I got us into this. The other night at the hotel, what did you mean when you said that your relationship was the only thing you were good at? You're always doing such fun stuff, Kate. Traveling around the world doing crazy things, guys always chasing after you. I could never compete with that. I was always just your boring older sister, but... ...my relationship with Stuart was the one thing that I had that you didn't. We were never in competition. Maybe you weren't. What do you think Stuart would say if he could see you now? - What? - He would lose his mind. Yeah. Listen. What is that? Oh, my God, that's the boat's engine. - Oh, my God, they've left us! - They-they wouldn't have left us, okay? - Oh, God. - Maybe it's something else. - Maybe it was a different boat. - We would've heard it arrive. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? I've got to go and try and get them on the radio again. Kate, what are we gonna do if they're not there? They will not have left us, okay? Taylor, can you hear me? Hello, are you there? Please answer me, someone! Taylor, it's Kate. Can you hear me? Hello, is anyone there? Please, someone answer me! Lisa, open the hatch! Open the hatch! It was a shark! I can't open it! It's caught on the chain! It's coming, it's coming! Oh, my God! Hurry, hurry! Oh, my God. I thought it was... I thought it was gonna get me. I thought it... I was dead. The cage is gonna break! It's gonna get through! Be quiet! Quiet, be quiet. It almost broke through the cage. We're not safe here anymore. Did you make contact with Taylor? They weren't there. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. They're not just gonna leave us here. They said they were sending someone down. But we heard them leave, didn't we? They also said they were gonna come down here and attach, like, a spare winch to the top of the cage, but did you even see one on the boat? I didn't... They are not gonna leave us to die down here, okay? - You need to calm down. - So we have to get back up to the top. No, Lisa, listen to me, we cannot just swim up. - We can swim fast. - No, we can't. - We can! - We will get the bends. Do you know what the bends is? It's nitrogen bubbles in the brain. The only way to go up is to ascend slowly with a decompression stop for five minutes. Unprotected, in open water. I'm so scared we're gonna die down here. - We are not gonna die. - I don't want to die down here, Kate. We're not gonna die down here. It's okay, they're gonna come and get us. Read me your air. Um... um... it says 80 bar. I don't know what that means. At this depth, that means we have about 20 minutes, tops, before you run out. What about you? Kate. Thirty bar. Oh, my God. I'm gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. You're gonna run out of air. Listen. Javier? What is that? Is that Javier? There! There! There, there, there! Hey! Hey! Can you hear us? We can see your flashlight. Javier! Hey! Why isn't he coming towards us? May-Maybe he's out of range. Hey! Javier! We need to make sure he knows where we are. What's he doing? I don't know. Well, if he heard us, why didn't he just signal? We need to get that winch cable. Seventeen bar. You're almost out of air. Okay... Okay, I'm... I'm gonna go out there and find him. You just need to tell me exactly what I need to do. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. Keep as close to the ocean floor as you can. Sharks attack from below, so if you keep to the floor, you should be fine. This button inflates your BCD. Use it to go up. This button deflates it. Listen to me, this is so important. No matter what happens, no matter how panicked you get, do not go straight up. You will die. Do you understand? I'll be right back. Get down on the floor as quick as you can, okay? That's good. You're doing so good. Okay. Keep your breathing slow. Just focus on the flashlight. Lisa, I can see the shark! It's coming towards you! Hide! Hide! Lisa? Lisa, can you hear me? Are you safe? - Lisa? - I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm in a cave. The shark almost got me. Where is it now? I think it's gone. Lisa? What's going on? Lisa, are you okay? Lisa? Answer me, please. I'm okay. I'm getting low on air. I can see the flashlight. I can see the beam. It's getting closer... Oh! Oh, my God. Oh. Lisa, what's wrong? What's wrong? I'm at the edge of some sort of cliff. I can't see the ocean floor. We're running out of time. Okay, I can do this. I can do this. Are you doing okay, Lisa? I am so scared, Kate. I can't even see what's below me. I see it! I see it! I see it! I found the flashlight. Javier?! He's not here, Kate. Javier?! I'm gonna come back, okay? Which way did I come from? Kate? Uh-oh. Um... Kate, can you hear me? Hello? Kate? Kate, please answer me. I'm really lost, and I'm freaking out right now. Oh, my God. Stay calm. Stay calm and make a decision. Kate! Kate, I'm so lost. Kate, can you hear me? Get back into the cage! Kate? Kate, I can hear you! Can you hear me? You're breaking up! Kate? I need you to bang a rock or something when you see the flashlight, so I know which way to go. I can hear you, Kate! He's got no air. Damn. Okay, I have to... I have to get the winch. I have to get the winch. Oh. Spear gun. Oh, God. I can see the flashlight. You're getting closer. Oh. Okay. I can see the lights on the cage. I'm coming. I'm coming, Kate. Lisa, I thought you were dead. Where's Javier? The shark ripped him to pieces. I have the winch cable. Oh, I was so lost I thought I would never see you again. Thread it through... Hey, the cable looks really thin. Do you think it will hold? It has to. Give me the flashlight. I'm gonna swim back up, and tell them - that we have to come up now. - Be careful! I'll be right back. Taylor? Taylor, can you hear me? Taylor, hello! - Kate? - It's Lisa. We managed to attach the cable to the top of the cage. We need to come up right now! - Is Javier with you? - No! - Javier is dead. - What? Oh... Jesus. Get back in the cage! Get back in the cage, now! I'm bringing you back up! They're bringing us up now. - They are? - Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Thank God. Kate, do you hear that? Do you hear that? Oh. Oh. - Oh, oh. See? - Yeah. Look. We're starting to move. We're gonna go home! Oh, thank God it's almost over! Oh, we're gonna go home! It's working. Look. We're getting higher. You did it, Lisa. You saved us. The gauge is starting to move. Look, Kate. Kate, it's at 46 meters. Forty-five Forty-four. - We're gonna get out of here. - Yeah. Kate, Lisa, can you hear me? Taylor, we can hear you. We're at 36 meters. Thirty-five! Thirty-four! Thirty-three. Thirty-two! Thirty-one! Good. Good. We're almost there. Thirty! Nice and slowly. Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight... - Taylor! - Taylor, the cable's breaking! - What? - Taylor, help us! All right, listen, stay calm. Don't move! I'm gonna slow it down. Taylor, help. Taylor? Taylor? Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! - Get it off, Kate! - Oh, my God! Okay. It's stuck, I can't move it! We're running out of time! I've got to get a hold of Taylor. Don't leave me, Kate. I don't want to suffocate. No, it's going to be fine. I'm going to come back. Taylor, it's Kate. - Are you hurt? - Lisa's trapped. Her leg is stuck and we have no air! My gauge is on five bar. It's gonna run out any minute. I'm going to send down extra air tanks. But, Kate, there's a reason that I didn't do this before. Moving onto a second tank is going to increase your chance of nitrogen narcosis, dramatically. You're going to need to watch each other closely to make sure that neither of you is behaving strangely or hallucinating. I've notified the Coast Guard. They're sending a team that's fully equipped for deep sea rescue. They'll be here in less than an hour. I'm so scared. It's gonna be fine. Look. Over there. It's the oxygen tanks. Please, be careful. I'll be right back. Shit. I'm almost out of air. Kate, did you find it? - Kate, are you okay? - Yeah. I'm okay. They sent down some flares. All we have to do is wait for the Coast Guard to arrive. - I've got the spare tank. - Kate, get down! Stay down. Where is it, Lisa? It's right above you, don't move. Oh, God, I can't see it! I'm going to make a break for the cage. No, Kate, no, no, no, don't move. Stay down, please, stay down. Open the hatch. Kate! No, Kate, no, Kate. I am not going to die down here. I'm going to run out of air. Come on, come on. God. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Lisa? - Kate? - Lisa, are you there? Oh, Kate, oh, Kate, I thought that you were dead. - Oh, God. - I managed to escape. Sharks, are circling me. I'm hurt. - How bad, how bad? - Bad. I'm bleeding a lot. It's... it's attracting more sharks. How much air do you have left? Thirty bar. The shark punctured my BCD. My oxygen's escaping. - I'm scared, Lisa. - I know, I know. Okay, I need you to listen to me. You need to remain calm. They are going to come down and get us. I need you to concentrate on your breathing, okay? Breathe in and out, like you told me, okay? In and out. In and out. So cold. Right, I'm gonna come and get you. I'm gonna come and find you right now. Tired... Come on, come on, come on, come on. Stay with me, Kate. Stay with me, okay? Just keep talking to me. I'm not going to make it. Kate? Kate, are you still there? Kate? Kate? I'm so cold. Kate, keep talking to me, please. My BCD. Oh, I'm gonna get us out of here. Please work. Please, please. Oh, God. - I'm gonna come and find you. - I... I'm gonna come and find you, Kate, okay? - ...can't... breathe. - I'm coming, Kate. Okay. Kate? Kate, can you see the beam from my flashlight? Lisa... Lisa... I'm so cold. Kate, keep talking to me, please. Can you see the beam from my flashlight? I see you, I see the flashlight. Yes! Yes, I can hear you! Okay, I'm coming to find you. Stay right where you are. Kate? Kate, can you see my flashlight? Over here. Kate! Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Kate, you're bleeding to death. Kate, we have to go up now. I'm not gonna let you die. Come on, we can do it. Come on. Use the flare, Kate. It'll help ward off the sharks. Taylor? Taylor, can you hear me? Taylor! Taylor, can you hear us? Taylor! Hello? - Can you hear me? Lisa? - Taylor, can you hear us? Lisa, I can hear you. Oh! Okay, um... we are heading up now. No, it's not safe. You need to stay in the cage. We don't have a choice. Kate has been badly hurt. We are coming up now. All right, but you need to go very slowly. Do you understand? If you ascend too quickly, you're going to get the bends. Okay. Look at your gauge. Tell me what your depth is. Um, we're at 30 meters. You need to slow down. If you get nitrogen bubbles in your brain, you are dead, do you understand? Yes, I understand! We are coming. We're getting there, Kate. We're getting there.
