[Sad cello music] [Seconds hand of a clock moving] [Gate motor] [Marker pen sliding] [Church bell] [Whip strike - Man groans] Yeah, thank you so much. What do you say? I want you to fuck me. Harder. God, I'm begging you! A simple "please" is more than acceptable. I'm not sure of how or why these things happen, but they do. And to be frank with you, we have very few options. Sadly, this is one of the times where medicine lies sorely behind. Since I'm not your first consultation, you know it's my professional duty to advise you regarding surgery. But you probably also know that could yield very little in prolonging your life. I'm sorry. [Church bell] Really, Mason, is it too much to ask your secretary to call me, to tell me you canceled lunch? I'm sorry, Beck. You said I had to be there to sign papers. You know that girl, Susie Clyde, that you played bridge with? Listen to me. Do you know why her husband married her? Her father owns half of Korea and her father's got my balls on a silver platter in fucking China. Stop it. First of all, you're talking about two entirely different countries. Second, you know I can't stand it, when you speak about people like that. Oh, yeah? I asked you to come down here so that I can sign some of these stocks over and put them in your name. So I can get out from underneath this goddamn audit. You're not in some kind of trouble, are you? We're gonna have to do a little creative accounting, honey. And you're gonna have to help. So, sign the papers and… I don't know if I'm gonna be home for dinner. It's important that we eat dinner as a family. It sure as hell is. [Man groans] Been with a lot of you girls. Don't know why it is so much better with you. Same time next week? [Birds chirping] [Seconds in a clock] - Wow, jeans and sneakers. - Thanks a lot, Hank. Someone's a little bitter they lost. Grow up. Loser. - Grow up. - Bitter loser. I told you, you'd be late if you played tennis. There some things you just can't squeeze in. HANK: I had to get back the money I lost last night. Oh, look at you. I told you: no more Vegas weekends. How much? Would it help if I told you I fell in love over the whole thing? You always tell us that the money can't buy you love. Well, except for in Ace's case here. Leave Janice out of this. I think you should leave Janice out of this. But then, what the hell kind of a merger would this be? Stop it, Hank. - Marissa, - Yes? Have you seen my calendar? No, I believe I saw it this morning in Mr. Mason's office. Do you want me to go get it? - Oh, would you mind, please? - Sure. Aaron! Aaron, do you plan on being late for everything or only unimportant events like our engagement party that my mother has spent the last six months planning? HANK: You'll be very pleased to know, mom, that I purposely let all that money slip through my fingers figuring if she still loves me by the time it's all gone, then maybe she is the one. No jeans. Go change. - Here you go, dear. - Oh, thank you very much. You need some help here? Good, good, good I got it, I got it. Thank you, Jess. - You look pretty. - Thank you. Oh, my god. We are so late! Don't forget to breathe! It's one of Valentina's girls. And so I'm telling you, she's trying to convince me to get a nipple ring. It's gonna make everything a bit more exciting. What is she talking about? Nipple clamps? She is just fantastic. REBECCA: I'm so out of place here. - Don't worry. - I'll get you a drink. - I need a drink. - Okay. Oh, my god. She is just fantastic. She tied us together an then she strapped a dual butterfly between us. - Butterfly? - Oh, a vibrator. She is amazing. Okay? I came three times. Then she had to pull me down from the ceiling. No, I'm not kidding. So, you're having your ceiling repainted? Yeah, yeah. Well, we've heard a lot of stories here tonight and I wanna hear your story. - My story? - Yeah. Believe me, I have no story. Well, you've got to have some story. I mean, what's your pleasure? What do you like? What gets you hot? You know, your fantasy. You don't have any answer for that? No, I'm married. Oh, Becks. Is she playing coy with me? What is it that you just simply can't resist? You, evidently. It's late, and I would like to take advantage of this buzz. Alright, ladies. That's it for me. Oh, I like your pants. Oh, thank you. - Ooh, ooh, girl. - She's very subtle. A double or like a triple heart bypass. Well, you hang in there. I know in your line of work time is money. I'd like to compensate you for my senior moments. No worries. What is it? I know it when I see it. When you guys look at each other is… Even them, tonight. I felt it. Oh, god! You could have felt them in New Jersey, right? The truth is, we just are lucky. But we work like hell. Don't we? We keep it exciting. Work I can do. The other part is missing. Okay, huh… I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anybody. You know everything that is to know about me, right? Well… I've never, ever… Baby, we know it's not good between you and asshole. It's not that, no. What? Oh, for God's sake. Come on, out with it. I… I have never… You've never come? Exactly. SHIRIN: Mason? He is such a man's man? REBECCA: We just do it twice a year. We are both fine with that. Oh, Becks! Oh, you must have to masturbate. Don't say that word. What, "masturbate"? I've been to a bunch of doctors, a bunch of therapists. Something is wrong with me. What's going on, Rebecca? I've never once had that passion in my life. Damn it. Is it so wrong for me to want… Come over tonight. Have dinner with us and we'll come up with something. I promise. Am I like your project now? Right. Forget your friggin schedule. Just be there at 8:00. You know what? What you need is a vibrator. No. That gives me the willies. KELLY: I know, weed. Let's get her stoned. No, I don't do drugs. No, I do know. I think you should seriously consider taking a lover. That is, if you don't mind breaking your vows. No moral quandary there, believe me, but… What am I supposed to do? Just go to some guy in the street? No, no. I mean a woman. What? A woman lover. Oh, come on. Just hear me out and do not listen to her, okay? A woman is so much more familiar with the manual. Who? Wait. I'm talking about a woman, you know, who has all kinds of tricks up her sleeves, who's used to particular situations… And as it happens, I happen to have a second cousin who runs this service business, and she could get you hooked up. Service business? SHIRIN: Kind of the dark sheep of the family. SHIRIN: Valentina has got the finest women I have ever seen. SHIRIN: Smoking. KELLY: Hey, hey, hey. Settle. Oh, my god. No one will ever find out. REBECCA: I thought that was just for men. REBECCA: Are you kidding me? I mean, women actually do that? SHIRIN: Oh, of course. SHIRIN: You have to think of this as an experiment, okay? It hasn't happened with a schlong. You are hiring her for a service. A very specific service. VALENTINA: No, no, no. That's fine. Nothing is too odd for us. What have you got to lose? Not a lot at this point. [Telephone rings] Better to serve you. Oh, hi, Shirin. No, no, I'm sure we can find someone for her. Fine. Consider it taken care of. Okay. This one should be fun. Feel like educating? Oh, yeah. What do you got, a virgin boy? Calm down, cougar. No, this is a housewife from the burbs looking for a new adventure. SINGING: Just a little Latin now. SINGING: Just a little singing, we… Shut the fuck up! I am speaking to an employee. Sylvie, look, this is a friend of my cousin's, okay? She's never been with a woman before but my lesbian cousin has explained to her that women make better lovers. Yeah. Tell me something I don't know. And she's from money. So I want this to go really well. Just think of all the referrals I could get from that upper crust stuffy country club set of hers. So I want you to do right by her, alright? And besides, she wanted someone closer to her own age. Sorry. Now sing. SINGING: I wanna feel this moment SINGING: though I can't control it SINGING: if it's all I ever do. That's what I'm going in with for my audition. And then, when I cut my single, I'm done with all of this. And what happened to your other hits? Sylvie, play nice. Now, I handpicked you for this and I don't want you to disappoint me. Sylvie, don't be late. I hear she's a stickler for time. You know how much I hate to ask you to take a call but it's Molly. She's invited me to her fiance's parents house so it's a big fuck deal. I gotta go, okay? Client is fully vetted, handpicked by Valentina, so crème de la crème, all the good stuff, right? Oh, sweetheart, I love you. Christ, I love you. Oh, fuck! I almost forgot! The client is a real stickler for time so don't be late, alright? [Sigh] [Claps hands] Oh, shit. This is insane. What am I doing? [Knocking at the door] May I help you? Ms. White? Yes. I believe we have an appointment. I think you're mistaken. Four o'clock? I think there's been some kind of a mix up. Well, you answered the door as though you were expecting someone and I presume you don't live here because I was just here two days ago. So again, I believe we have an appointment. I had an appointment, yes. But with someone my own age. I get it. You're expecting Sylvie, your usual? My what? Will you come in? Come in. Are you from the service? Oh, Sylvie. So, this is your first time. You're nervous. It's perfectly natural. But you don't have to worry. We will go as slow and easy as you like. Look, Miss… Paris. Miss Paris, I asked for someone my own age. Age is a state of mind, you know? Maybe for you. What are you, like 23? I'm 29. See what I mean? You're not what I asked for and I'm not paying you. So don't be starting your clock or whatever it is… I am sorry for the misunderstanding but the woman who was supposed to be here had an emergency and she asked me to fill in. I'm not paying you. I'm not asking you to. I am just politely taking my leave. No hard feelings. I hope that next time, you get what you're looking for. Mom? What's going on? Come sit with me. Just come sit with me for a minute, will you? I'm so sorry that I haven't been a better mother to you. What's going on with you, mommy? Going through a midlife crisis or something? Are you okay? Do you have any idea how much I love you? If only I had been stronger. If only I had been there as I should have been. I am so sorry, I should have… We agreed not to talk about it. If we don't talk about it we'll never get past it. Please. Some things we don't need to get past, mom, so just… There must be something I can do. Not talk about it. How about that? I want to do better baby. I just wanna make it better. How can I make it better? Some things you can't fix. So don't. Oh, I see. Oh, that's pretty cute. I like it. - Okay, I admit it was for the champagne. - Yes? You were there for the champagne? - Yeah, and the art. - How was the art? There was big pictures and a spotlight. I was gonna try make a little tune. [Paris laughs] Just get me in the mood. Yes, I'm in love. I am gifting you these stocks as part of some estate planning. Am I clear on that? Do you understand that? What? I am so sick of your greed and your self-righteous ego. What? It was one thing for you to send the boys to Harvard 'cause I understand you want them to take over your family business. And I even let you give a 100,000 shares of Westridge United to the boys. Look, we're not gonna have this conversation. Okay, Rebecca? You just gonna get upset. And I'm not gonna change my mind. Look, I'm just a man, okay? I'm just the man that you happened to marry. And I think on the whole, I've been pretty good to Jessica. I mean, she's led a pretty charmed life. You owe her, Mason. What? Not that shit again. Not that again! Goddamn! It was one fucking night! One night! I'm not giving her stocks in this business. You get it? This business has been in my family for 100 years and that was the deal between you and me, right from the start. I love her. She's not my blood, the boys are. You can say I'm cold hearted, but she's not mine. For god's sake, will you wake up? This isn't some kind of a monarchy. You're the only father she has ever known. What do you think this is gonna do to her? She already feels like a second class citizen. You say to her whatever you want to say, Beck. I'm not gonna change my mind. I'm going to bed now. Don't bother joining me. Alright. Hey. Hey, Dad. That's it. Only once. [Screams] We just came from this place, alright? That won't help. Are you crazy? Don't make me mad. You're totally getting us lost. [Melancholic cello music] So, we're fucking dying here, god. Come on! Tell everything. Nothing. Nothing happened. I was just so thrown for a loop. Oh. Masterplan. The problem we all have with our planning thing is that it can't prepare you for anything, can it? For some unforeseen obstacle, like some she-devil coming through the door instead of someone like me. What is the big deal? Just try again. [Sad piano music] [Telephone] Better to serve you. Oh, yes, Ms. White. So, let me get this straight. You want the same person you had last time. Yes. And you want exactly the same location. Yes. Consider it done. Okay, Sylvie. [Knocking at the door] [Deep breath] Oh. Well, that's enough to hurt a girls ego. If she gave a shit. I don't know what I was expecting. It's okay. Valentina knows that there's not a filly that I can't break. So let's get down to business, shall we? I have dildos, you can strap on, we can swap, we can double 69. Fingers are fine, if you prefer but just two or three. No fisting 'cause I have a cyst. But if you want the best thing for your buck we can ecstabang. Ecsta… what? Ecstabang. We do some ecstasy, then each other. It's so fucking sweet. That's not gonna happen. I know who you are. It's you, you're the one who was with Paris, The one with the redwood stick up here. Doris Day ass. Wow. So… What did the two of you do if you don't mind me asking? Look, I don't know what she told you, but nothing happened with that other girl. Paris is a woman. Don't be underestimating her. I wasn't doing any such thing. I don't know her. I don't wanna know her. Look, I'm sure you all watch out for each other, and that's just great. But as a paying customer, I'm used to getting exactly what I order. God, she was right about you. Really? What did she say? She's rather poetic, Paris. She said that you were bitter, sweet… Well, this obviously isn't working, so I think it's time for you to go now. In junior league little Stepford wives are all exactly the same. Toughest part of your day is trying to figure out where to seat Mrs. Weatherby at the smuckety fuck fundraiser, right? Oh, you're really in the deep, are you. Big what-if every morning with your bran muffin Tic-tac… Wrong side of the clock. I bet there's a half-empty bottle of booze in your panty drawer right next to that worn out 45 of "Qué Será Será" Will I be pretty… or will I just be. This was such a huge mistake. What the hell do you think actually separates us anyway? Paris and I don't answer to anyone. Fucking no one. How about you? Get out. Sorry, I didn't mean to make you wet your pants, I just… I said get out! Now, you are obviously looking for something I hope you fucking find it. And when you do… commit. Think about it. Why now? We know that we could remotely understand what you saw in Mason. I mean we thought you loved him, right? As a secretary with a 2-year-old strapped to my hip, Mason looked pretty good. Okay, I get it. Security counts for a lot, when you have a baby but it's not like owning a dog. That's what I'm saying. You'll make such a good mommy, I mean… You just want to get me knocked up 'cause you think it'll stop me cursing, right? - It'll stop you drinking. - Yeah, yeah, I was told that. You two are so lucky. What's it like? On the level? Being in love with Kelly is sanguine, erotic, delicious, magical. Downright mystical. But you know, these are just words, you know? I mean them. But I really want you to feel it. That was the plan. You asked for this - this thing. Don't let this bitch stop you. You ask for this - this Paris by name next time. But I'm serious, Becks, don't spend the rest of your life settling. Don't do it. [Deep breath] [Knocking at the door] I'd like to thank you for coming. Third time a charm? I'm a little out of my comfort zone here. You do that a lot. What? Check the time. Don't worry. You'll get your moneys worth. That's… Good one. Funny. Would you like a drink? No. But go ahead. You don't drink? I thought it sort of came with the territory. I like to concentrate on the details, try not to get too fuzzy. You take your work very seriously. Yes, I do. So, what can I do for you? Have you done this with men? This? No. Are you a lesbian? Oh, god, no. I… Oh! For some reason, I just thought that somehow this might be easier with a woman. I wanna know what passion is. I wanna know what an orgasm feels like. Well, they are two distinctly different goals. It'll be whatever you want or need. But I think you should be clear. An orgasm is a physical phenomenon and that, I can help you with. Passion, is another thing entirely. No. Stop watches. No hatches. No shifts. Just… Lean back. Relax. Dad, can I have the Corvette? Yeah, but you know, you might actually have to show up to work to get it. Mom, what's up with you? Something you want to tell us? No. Your wedding ring? Oh, that. I left it at the gym today. I already called. They've already locked it in their safe. Damn well better baby, because that thing is worth a fortune. Those things are definitely not cheap. Just wondering if it's worth it. What, the family you're marrying into? Are you kidding? And that girl? Couldn't be better if I picked it myself. But you did pick her yourself. More chicken, Mason? No, thanks. No, thank you. Okay, there is a Jewish guy, a German guy and a French guy. I can't. I'm so sorry I wasted your time. There is a reason why you are here. I can't. [Sigh] So you wanted me to get you something really special and he wouldn't make up his mind and it took for ever and ever and ever, right? Yeah, I know. I'm gonna show her in a minute. See… Well I don't really know if it's your fault or puppet's fault, but… I'm angry. But he wants me to get you this. [Phone] Okay. Needed that. Better to serve you. Oh, yes. Oh, yeah, absolutely, I'll have her wearing the Dorian glasses and… and she needs to bring the blowup elephant and the gorilla. Certainly wouldn't want to bring the wrong animal. Great. Oh, uh, excuse me, may I put you on hold for a moment? Better to serve you. Yes, this is Mistress… Miss White. Yes, yes. Do you have my ring? I must have left it at the hotel. Yes, she said you left that behind. Ah, good. No, don't worry. These things happen. Can I swing by now and just… Well, actually, it's not at the office. She said that you wanted to make another appointment same place but at 7 p.m. and that she would bring it to you then. What? Are you happy with that arrangement? Mrs. White? Are you confirming? That little bitch. [Knocking] Do you have my ring? Well, may I have it? Pretty. It is pretty damn expensive. And if you think that I didn't know you had it and you were just gonna pawn it then you must think I was born yesterday. I'm sorry. You are simply too much. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing at all. Wait! Wait a minute. Will you come back here? I'm sorry. That was unforgivable. I don't know why I said that. I had to get my ring back. You have it back. You don't understand. My husband would kill me! They'd never understand how I could lose something so precious. Precious, value wise? Precious, meaningful? It's very valuable. Meaningful? Not so much. I'm sorry. Would you like one? Sure. It's been a long day. How many…? No shoptalk allowed. Ms. White I… It's Rebecca. And I'll pay you, of course but I just came back to get my ring. No, you didn't. Oh, yes, I did, actually. Do you ever just stop and let things play themselves out? No, I don't. Why do you think I'm here? Nothing is going to happen that you don't want. But, unless you tell me otherwise, I'm going to kiss you, Rebecca. That's all. I'm sorry. I can't. You said he signed this all over to you because of the internal investigation. REBECCA: He is trying to make sure that if Westridge Amalgamated has to file bankruptcy, that Westridge United won't be affected. If we proceed with this plan, you do understand what you are about to do? Yes. You will own the voting stock with monetary value from Westridge United. He must trust the shit out of you. Yes. He does. But he'll still be able to be CEO and maintain his current lifestyle, right? For the most part. But as for the rest of the estate the lion's share of it will be yours and it will render him… well, impotent. Since we have exhausted all avenues of treatment, I think it's time you tell your family and your loved ones. Once you reach a certain progression the symptoms are gonna come on faster. They're gonna need to be prepared and as the end grows nearer you're gonna need help. I promise I will do everything I can to keep you as pain-free and to make this as tolerable as something like this can be. I guess dad didn't really answer the question, did he? But the only one who can answer it, is you. - Is it worth it to you? - Yeah, of course it is. What about Emily? You're not in love with Janice, not like that. Emily and you are made for each other, and Janice, she is… Hey, we have a lot in common. The only thing you two have in common is third generation, over indulged wealth. You don't belong in suits and ties, Ace. You belong in flip flops and raggedy ass T-shirts with really dorky slogans. So don't do it unless you're absolutely sure. It is for the rest of your life. I just want you to be happy, that's all. Just remember it's not too late. I've got to say, Rebecca, you've got some balls. And I mean, some cast-iron, rock-solid balls, lady. [Elevator bell - "door is open"] I… am at your disposal. - Where is she already? - Right. I don't know. For mom to miss dinner? Especially this one. Did I hear my name? Oh! You're not ready. Janice, I'm so sorry, honey. Something came up. Order pizza, and I'll see you all in a couple of hours. And Janice, tomorrow night I'll… sitting arrangements. I'm, sorry. Promise. Tomorrow. Have fun. Seriously? Yeah, she knows that I don't do fake food. Whatever. Aaron, I'm gonna need you to call "Chez sous les meilleurs", okay? Maybe we could just get pizza? I'm all for pizza. No. And order me Épinards et Concombres à la grecque with a side of focaccia, okay? 'Cause I need my protein and I would still like to fit into my Vera Wang. I have to go make a call. Bye, sweetheart. Yeah, Aaron, I'd like some of that "fuckaccia" bread too, please. Fuck you. Wow, Aaron. So what was that? [Funny clarinet music] Spinach salad. I'm not talking about crazy, I'm talking about mom. That was weird. - Super weird. - Yeah. She was frazzled. Well, you and the diva are gonna be so happy together. Pizza! [Laughs] No, I hate my stomach. I haven't been to the gym in way too long. I used to have a pretty good body before kids and menopause. I never looked like you, though. This doesn't mean anything. Rebecca. I hate that I did this. Why did you? It was a birthday present from Mason. He loves perfection. Sort of the one thing we have in common. I've spent my whole life trying to be perfect. I never felt good enough or thin enough, pretty enough, smart enough. All the things that make us not perfect are what make us so perfectly who we are. That's who you are, Rebecca. Per - fec - tion. You make me feel that way, my beautiful girl. - It's official. - She popped. She looks like she's 26 How dare you? It's so exquisite. Well, I am sextonished. Okay, okay. I'm so glad that's gone. I was not a fan. You totally corrupted me. I hope you're proud of yourself Well, I feel like I deserve a glow. It's so bad. We took our little girl to school, and she got an A in muff diving. Awesome. You know we totally love you, but you always had a redwood up your ass. I think what little miss humble is trying to say, Becks, is that we just couldn't be more thrilled. Thank you. I think you'd like my kids. Jessica is my first love. I have Hank an Aaron… obviously Mason was a Hank Aaron baseball fan. Byron is one of my favorite poets. Read to me, please. "Do go and ask Maude to come up here" "it probably never occurred to her" "Dear me, this act is over" "Our little secret, Maude." Really? So where does this possibly go from here? I don't care. Really. For the first time ever I am not trying to cram it in for a reason or squeeze it in because I have to. I'm just gonna enjoy every last moment. Oh, my god! What? I missed dinner, I didn't even call. - Just stop. - Oh, I'm sorry. And just… before you leave, I… That was so amazing. Oh, I am in love with your mouth. They're gonna be worried sick. Thank you, Paris. Thank you. It's not like mom not to call. I'm starting to get a little worried. Yes, she never misses family dinner. Maybe they're together. You know, figuring out how to tell us and what to do. So, are we just supposed to act like we don't know? Yes, I think we should. So don't say anything to mom or dad until they tell us. Alright. Sorry. I got stuck in the worst freeway accident and my cellphone went dead. I… - Dad is not with you? - No. - Why? He's not here? - No, and we all know why. You all know, what? Wait. Give it to me. What? Now, let's not jump to conclusions. This isn't jumping, mom. I was in dad's office before I left tonight trying to find a document for tomorrow. I went through his desk, I found this. I know I shouldn't have, but… He's been having all this trouble working. Whoever is trying to turn his company upside down is succeeding. And you know, that's what I thought it was. I thought all the late nights was… Yeah, his temper, all the drinking… Well, Mom, you know. Everybody let's just remain calm. I need you to listen to me very carefully. You are not to say a word. What? Did you know? You're not to say a word and I mean it. I will talk to your father and… Right, cause you talk about everything. You will not breathe a word until I've spoken with him. Is that clear? Sure. This is gonna change everything! You're right. It will. How long have you known? What? [Melancholic piano music] What are you talking about? How long have you known? I've known for the past few weeks. I went to see Dr. Weller. Rebecca, do you know what this means? I mean, for us, for the family, for the kids, the company, for Christ sake. I think I do. So, yeah, then, well… We're gonna fix it then, right? We're gonna fix it. We'll fix it before it's too late. [She leaves the drink on the table] I hope you believe me and understand when I say I am so sorry. I am truly sorry, Mason. But I think we both know It's already too late. REBECCA: He said it's cancer, and it's metastasized KELLY: I can't believe this. SHIRIN: Honey, are you sure? Yeah. KELLY: What do you need from us? To help me keep it together for them right now. Okay. REBECCA: How do you do this with so many people? Strangers. I don't "do" this. I know you don't like me digging, but can't you make a living another way? I mean, look at you. Seriously. You are gorgeous, you are smart, you are assured… Why this? I clear over $200,000 a year. I make my own schedule and I get to give back. Give back? Give back? I'm a little lost here. Nothing. No. What do you mean? I wanna know why you do this. Why are you here? I wanna know you. Please, don't take this the wrong way. I don't expect anything back really. I just want to say it. One time in my life. And really mean it. I love you. You'll have us going up here. REBECCA: Honey, it's time. No, we're down here. We just came from this place, alright? REBECCA: You need to tell me what happened. In fact, look at the last group of palm trees over there. We should go investigate them. You should go investigate over there, right? You had your chance. You had your chance. [Car skidding] [Crash] [Paris screams] Stop! [Soft piano music] This is not about me, Rebecca. I want to taste you. Oh, I love the way you smell. [Cries] VALENTINA: You know, you've been working for me for -what- five years now? I've never seen you like this. You haven't taken a new client in -what- six weeks? And don't even try to tell me that you've been busy because I know exactly what you've been busy doing. It needs to stop now for your own good. I don't want it to stop. I know you don't. But I have seen so many girls go down this track, fall for Johns. It's not like that. It's never like that. But it never ends well. I have to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've got your back, kid. Bloody hell, girls. This artwork that you do, Paris, seriously, it's amazing. Was this what you were used to do? It's a hobby. I love this. It's so cute. Honey, this is not a hobby. You are extremely talented. I'm not kidding. Tell me. Well, the point is… sort of besides the point… In and of itself… What does any of them really mean? Nothing. But when you put one here, and here, and here, all of these funny, random, seemingly, as in life, disjointed pieces, somehow they all magically come together. Every speck, every part… it all comes together to create the whole picture. I was instructed to give you this after the funeral. I'm so sorry. Who are you? I have to tell you. In all my years I have never been stumped by a client. Not once. Until now. Okay. So here's the truth: I watch a lot of soap operas. So when I got your call, at first I thought: "Oh, that had to be Mrs. White's evil twin". Or you were going to blackmail Valentina, which I do not recommend, because that gal is one crazy bitch. My favorite: you are actually looking for a ticket on Valentina's gravy train yourself. No. Thank you. I needed that. And thank you for meeting with me. What can I do for you? When the time comes, I'd like you to give this to Paris. It's a gift. She'll know what it means. But you see her almost every day, why don't you just give it to her? No, I… I have not been able to see Paris for the last few days. Ohh, lovers quarrel. Sorry. You know, would you mind losing the shades? I can't see you. It drives me nuts. - You really tied one on last night. - This is important. I want her to get out. Did it ever occur to you that maybe we do this because we like it? That we are proud of our trade, that we've had opportunities? You, yes. But not Paris. You really care about her, don't you? I'm in love with her. Yes, you are. But I hate to tell you, you're not gonna be the last. I need to be her last… client. She trusts you, Sylvie. She relies on you, I know that. I'm not gonna be seeing Paris again. So, your husband found out, hm? You want soap opera? I'm dying. Cancer. I don't have a lot of time left and I'm beginning to have some severe physical symptoms. I don't want Paris to see me like this. I want her to remember me… Of course you do. …remember the good stuff. Okay, listen to me. You have got to say goodbye to her. You have to. You know that. Look, you're scared. You can't just disappear. And I don't want you to worry not about Paris, because I'm gonna pick her back up. I'm gonna put her in my back pocket. Okay? I'm gonna take care of Paris, but you have to tell her. And not just for her. For you. For you. So, as we say in the trade, "women up". I need to say goodbye. What's going on? I love you so much. We really want this. Oh, I want this. I've wanted this my whole life. And you gave it to me. [Church bell] Hi, sweetie. You okay? We'll see you at the house. Your mother retained me to work for you as long as you need me. Oh, what's this? Your mother revised her will. She was very busy her last few months. This will all become clear to you when you're able to read through it. - You guys all right? - Yeah. We're all right. She wanted to make sure that there wasn't anything that you needed. She was pretty certain there would be some harsh feelings among the ranks. So she retained me to protect your interests. If it makes any difference, I have never met a woman with more character than your mother. My sincerest condolences. Are you okay? I'll see you at home, okay? "My dear Jessica," My dear Jessica, I know this can't erase the past but it will protect your future. When your dad signed his assets over to me I decided to reconstruct my will so that all three of my children would be equal and all sharing your futures as true brothers and sisters. So what I couldn't do in my lifetime, I've done now. Protected you. Just know I am with you. I love you, mom. [Soft piano music] Oh, my god. Excuse me. Excuse me, Ms. Scofield? You're the artist, right? Hi. Yeah? Do I know you? No. But you knew my mother. And I want to know… I want to know about my mom. Okay. See, I feel like I've known her in a very black and white way. And I want to know who she became in the end. And now for Miss Scofield's center piece… What would you like to know? "Une petite mort".
