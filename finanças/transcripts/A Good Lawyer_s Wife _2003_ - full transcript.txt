Doesn't grandpa have any siblings? Why has my life become such a mess? At first, I blamed it all on your father Damn... Well, enough about that loser So what? Whoever's fault it is, my life's still a mess... I... finally feel like a grown up these days Someone who can take charge of her life... I'm seeing someone What? Yeah, and I might marry him Who, you mom? I'm finally having sex The first time in 15 years Oh my god! You may not want to hear this, but I don't care I'm finally getting an orgasm To feel it at this age, it's hard to understand, right? Listen Life's about being truthful to yourself. Truthful... Honest as you can be! Nothing matters if you forget this Even if you had a day to live This is definitive! Definitely! No one would believe I just buried my husband A woman enters the world with a firm chest and leaves with a flabby one, but I'm really happy Extremely happy Your mom's great. Really endearing... Thanks, for everything Is that so? You really moved me this time Really! So, stop thinking of other things and do a better job with your life And what about now? You, whose beloved were buried in the cold ground And them, who committed the crime, whether mistaken or crazed, that led to these deaths Those who are still haunted by guilt How can you live like that? You anticipated pressure from the government and the right wing You need to be strong! If we cannot solve this problem, you're disowning everything we have worked so hard for You fear that one wrong move will trap us in eternal guilt and never release our beloved ones' souls from this world This is not the path we should take It is time for change! It is time for recovering our pride as human beings! Did I come on too strong? Stop pushing too hard! You think I like doing this? Lecturing like a fucking school principal! Think of it as a process I'm going! Join us for a meal! What an asshole!
