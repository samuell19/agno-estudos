Hello! Sir! Nila Haque has returned. Which Nila Haque is it? Sir, Nila Haque, the celebrity chef Mr. Rafsan’s wife! What are you saying? Are you drunk? Sir, trust me! Nila Haque is sitting in front of me. A truck driver has brought her to the station just 10 minutes before. Driver has found her hiding in the back behind the freight. Also, Nila Haque is heavily wounded. She’s not letting anybody around her, just shouting out. Have you informed Rafsan Haque? No, sir! How can I proceed without informing you? Do this- call upon Rafsan Haque to the station. Also, don’t let the driver go anywhere. Okay, sir. I’m coming. Greetings sir! Drink the water. Call Rafsan. Call Rafsan. He’ll come. Can you look at me, please? The wound on your face seems serious. Would you like to go to a doctor or a hospital? No! Call Rafsan. Call him. He’s on the way. He’ll be here. Can you please tell me in detail? What should I say? Like what? My face! My hands! Every physical, mental torture have been done. They do human trafficking. They have trafficked a lot of women. They kept me imprisoned. All of them forced themselves on me. I can’t say anymore. Call Rafsan please. Drink the water please. Call Rafsan please. Where’s Rafsan? I’m calling him right away. Were you a hostage of them for these 2.5/3 years? Where’s Rafsan? He’s coming. He’s been informed. Call him, how far he is! Brother Sajal! What’s happened? Oh, it’s Nuru. When have you arrived? Just now. Why are the police here? Don’t you say! The police have come to Kuddus’ home. You know Nasrin, Kuddus’ eldest daughter. They’ve come to catch her friend. Why do the police want to catch Nasrin’s friend? And what is Nasrin’s friend doing at Kuddus’ home? The girl was hiding here. Kuddus didn’t realize. This girl is really shrewd. She used to work at an old woman’s home at Shapla Crossing. That old woman’s son lives in America with his wife. They hired the girl to take care of her. The girl is pretty educated, passed grade 10. The woman even made her encashing cheque from the bank. The girl took the opportunity, copied her signature and stole money. Oh my God! She copied the signature to encash cheque! How much did she steal? The girl is very cunning. She knew that the bank teller will doubt If she steals a lot at once. She was taking away money little by little. The old woman is lucky. The girl probably couldn't steal more than 20 thousand. She got caught early. What a time to live in! Here she is! Hey! Get out. You’ve been saved this time. Otherwise, you would’ve been imprisoned for 2 years. Your brother has come to get your bail. . Vicky Zahed’s REINCARNATION Do you know how much I had to pay for your bail? 30 thousand taka. I gave 20 thousand to the old lady. The remaining 10 thousand is paid at the station. Why did you spend so much money for me? I do have reasons, obviously. I am a driver. 30 thousand taka is a lot of money for me. Listen! I am not into any more crimes. I was imprisoned just for some thousands of cash. I won’t do this anymore. The devil listening to the Scriptures. Don’t act before me. I know these things very well. I know you really well, I know everything about you. So stop your acting. Let me show you something. Look at it very carefully. Be attentive. Whos’ this? My look-alike! She looks exactl y like me! Not exactly, but she almost resembles you. Her name is Nila Apa. Nila Apa used to be very beautiful. She had a nice skin tone. She’s not like you. She didn’t have these burnt scares like you. Your voice is so harsh to ears, but her voice was beautiful. The main difference between you two is the eyes. Her eyeballs were black, yours are vague. What a mystery! I heard, seven people with one face can live in this world! Look! Here’s the proof. She’s totally like me. I’ve got a proposal for you. If you agree to it, both of our lives will change. I do want to change my life. I don’t like this bloody lifestyle anymore. Tell me what I have to do. Nila Apa has been missing for 2.5 years. You’ll act like Nila Apa and enter her home. She has a DPS of 1 crore taka. We’ll split the DPS money by 50/50. Brother! I thought of you as a decent man. The plan that you’re making, it’s impossible! They put me in jail for some thousand taka. And you are talking about 1 crore taka! Do you think it’s a joke? It isn’t easy, very difficult. Life itself is very difficult, Rokeya. We make arrangements and put efforts to simplify our lives. Think about me. I am a graduate. But by luck, I am a driver. I don’t know about other countries, but in ours, it’s a degraded job. I’ve got a chance today to change my dishonourable difficult life. If you help me, both of our lives will get easier. Now it’s up to you. I’ll not force you anything. People have humiliated me as well. The scars that you can see on my face and hands, these are burnt scars. My face got burnt, I got fired from the hospital I worked in. What did they say, you know? People will get scared looking at me. None will visit the hospital anymore. Then give it a thought for once. Listen! You know English. Isn’t it? I know English as much as I am taught in Bangla medium. I studied till grade 12, I know that much. You are sharp. You can do well if you listen. Watch videos on YouTube, listen to them carefully. You’ll be fine. I do watch movies. Do you understand English from movies? No, I don’t. The fact is- Nila Apa used to talk fluently in English. Her pronunciation was great. I am a graduate yet couldn’t be as perfect as her. What if I speak in perfect Bangla rather than in English? That I understand, but she used to add English words while speaking. Sometimes she couldn’t express in Bangla. I’ll speak in proper Bangla, and will add English words sometimes. Yes. Take this. This is called a lens, and it’s a solution. Have the solution in that and then put the lens on. I fancied wearing lenses. You’ll have to have the solution while putting on lenses. I know. I’ve seen my friend wearing these. Sign. I can copy the sign, I did. I changed the color of my eyeballs with lenses. I’ll wear better clothes, will go to the bank and will fool the people outside. How do I fool the people at home? Won’t Mr. Rafsan recognize his wife? What about Nila’s parents? Won’t they recognize their daughter? Fortunately, Nila’s parents aren’t alive. And you’ve guessed right. Mr. Rafsan is the weakest point for us. He can literally expose our whole plot. Then again, Rafsan is the strongest point. He can make it more believable if he’s convinced. I didn’t understand. You can understand now that a driver knows about the important secrets of a house. Yes, as you know. Yes. None knows Rafsan better than I do. I know from my experience, Rafsan’s wife is the center of his life. He really loves his wife. I haven’t seen Rafsan to smile for the last 2.5 years. So having his wife back after such a long time, he will be emotional and fall into prey. That emotion will influence him more. What if it doesn’t happen? We have to take this risk, at least. The more you will be detached from Rafsan, You will be safe. You might get caught, if you get too close to him. Isn’t it the problem? He’ll get back to his wife after such a long time, he’ll obviously keep her closer. How do I tackle that? I have plan for that as well If you follow that, Rafsan won’t get close to you at all. Okay, then. I understand what you’re saying. I’ll follow but we can’t make any mistakes. If you make a mistake, but again in that prison We obviously have possibilities of making mistakes. The more you stay there, the more you’ll make mistakes. We have to finish our job as soon as possible and then we have to elope. That’s true. How many days can we possibly get? We shouldn’t spend more than 7-10 days, you know! Then we’ll cross the borders. What we have to do before that is to make a video footage of you. In the footage, you'll say, You can’t stay with Rafsan anymore for the mental traumas. You’re going away. Also mention that none should look for you anymore. Your plan seems fine, we might succeed. But, another thing! What if real Nila returns? We’ll be red handedly caught. The person who hasn’t returned for 2.5 years, how can she return all of a sudden? I know, my plan isn’t full proof, We can be caught at any moment, if luck betrays. But, I want to at least try once, trusting on my luck. And if it works, then it's a lottery! How are you feeling today, Bhabi (sister-in-law)? Good. Sugar? Have you forgotten that I don’t take sugar in my tea? I can’t remember anything. Bhabi! When did you have your nose pierced? It was long before. Really? It’s pretty strange, you know! You might not remember but you used to be scared about nose piercing. You didn’t do it during childhood, adulthood, nor during marriage. After the marriage, I inspired you like- “I’m also afraid, let’s do the piercing together.” What’s happening to me? I can’t remember anything! I try to remember a lot of things. But, it only hurts me. Look at it. Can you remember anything? Yes, here are you and me. It’s probably 1-2 days back of the day when you went missing. You didn’t have the nose pierced back then, Bhabi! Is it so? Yeah, it’s so. It’s very strange as we took appointment together for piercing, but we’re living together. You did the piercing. And I didn't even notice! Isn’t it very strange? I remember. I went for the piercing after a few days of this photo. I didn’t inform you. I thought I would surprise you. But I was surprised! What’s been happening? Would you buy me a nose-pin? Sure! Bhabi! I haven’t pierced my nose yet. Have your meal! Why did you take the trouble? It’s not a trouble at all. Rafsan! I can’t tolerate anyone’s touch anymore. I feel disgusted. Did I hurt you? Can you remember what I cooked for you on the day you went missing? It’s been 3 years! The way my life has been messed up in these 3 years, my memory has been lost as well. I can remember, but very vaguely. I cooked the same noodles that day. You enjoyed it a lot. You don’t have any fault in this. I’ll be hurt if I see you crying. Can we stay together tonight? We can gossip. Can you please give me a bit more time? Take your time. Have the noodles. Ugh! These aren’t the copies of DPS. Probably Rafsan has the documents. We need to get those. We can’t ask him straight, need to figure out a way. Figure out your way then. Bhabi! Bhabi! Where did she go! Bhabi! The signature is also not being perfect, it’s getting messed up. What if we get caught? No! Why would we? Bank won’t notice small details. There’ll be no problem if the customer is present there. If I go to the bank with your signature, I’ll be red handed caught. But if you yourself go there, no one will bother. Bhabi! She might be on the terrace. Bhabi! She’s coming to this side. Bhabi! Bhabi! Bhabi! Bhabi! Bhabi! Bhabi! Bhabi! I’ve been calling you. Can’t you hear me? I've been looking for Bhabi! I've been calling her for so long. I can’t find any response from her. She might be in the washroom. I need to talk to you. What has happened? We can’t meet like this anymore. We literally escaped by luck. Allah has saved us. All praise to Allah! Shaheen! Sir! Has the sketching started? Yes, sir. According to Nila Haque, those traffickers always wear masks. Even while torturing her, they had masks or the black clothes over their mouths. So, she didn’t see anyone’s face for 3 years? Yes, sir, it seems kind of like that. I was as surprised as you. But when I convinced her a bit more, she changed her statement. She caught a glance of some of their faces once or twice. From those memories, she has shared some information with the sketch artist. But according to him, the information is barely anything. Yet, he’s tried to create a concrete image with that. It’s strange! Why did she change her statement? Also, the physical tortures she has mentioned about, it’s strange not to see the abuser’s face during then. Sir, I think she isn’t thinking straight due to her excessive mental trauma. That’s why she keeps changing her statement. Listen Shahin, I’ve got news from our source. The hill tracts of Chittagong Neela mentioned, doesn’t exist at all. Sir, are you suspecting something? This case seemed odd to me from the very beginning. Have you noticed her wounds? Yes sir, I did. Didn’t it seem like self wounds? But sir, I don’t understand one thing. Why would Neela haque lie? I don’t know but she is hiding something from us. Shahin, how many cases did you have in your career where the missing person came back after 3 years? Sir, I’ve been in the service for 7 years, I haven’t faced any cases like this one. I haven’t seen anything like this either in my 15 years career. Sir! Oh, it’s done! You may go now. Sir! Bhabi, if you push yourself a little, gather a bit more courage, the criminals will be caught. I’ve talked to the OC. He said whatever information you are giving, Is not enough. I don’t want anyone to get punished. I don’t want it. I am lucky to get back to you. Isn’t it enough that I’m alive? I understand that. But think about it, if your information can help us to get to the criminals, no other girl else will face what you’ve gone through. I think you should cooperate. Ma’am, Afnan sir has sent me. He wants to reactivate Mrs. Neela’s credit card. I’ll need her signature. Sister, please sign here. Right here? Yes. So, you mean the woman who’s in our house isn’t your sister-in-law But a look-alike? Don’t laugh brother. Doesn’t it seem odd to you? No it doesn’t. I’ve no doubt about my own wife but you do? Brother, she was my best friend too, I hope you haven’t forgotten it. She hasn’t been with us for a long time, granted. But she has changed so much! We used to have tea together every morning and she totally forgot that I don’t take sugar with tea? Also, you remember how refined her pronunciation was. now that person pronounces “su-gar” instead of “shu-gr? Really? Have you seen her face? She hasn’t been with us for three years. Where was she? How was she? You should guess. You should feel. A girl can even suicide in this situation. So, think about it a little before complaining. If you were in her shoes, you would have been so traumatized that You wouldn’t even recognize me. So, stop complaining. Why aren’t you staying together? What’s the problem? Love. it means space in my definition. She wants that space to create love again. I should give her that space. She takes everything so easily. There’s nothing to force here. I respect your love and space. I just have one last question. Which is her dominant hand? The same type of question again. She is left-handed, why? Exactly! And that girl signed the documents with her right hand in front of me. I was there, brother. I am sure she signed with her left hand. It’s your delusion. You are traumatized. I spoke to the OC about this and he agrees. There must be something wrong. I don’t want to talk to you right now. Please leave. It’s not right to be hosted during active duty. But missing your cooking doesn’t feel right either. I didn’t cook but how was it? Excellent. You may have not cooked but at least supervised it. I remember the programme from 3 years ago. Rashed Chowdhury’s son got married and the ceremony took place in your hotel. His special request was that you supervise the whole programme. Not everyone can afford you. I was fortunate to come here and taste your cooking. Oh my God! I felt like chewing down my fingers too. What's the progress of the case? Not much. We can’t gather much information from her. It's supposed to happen. We don’t know what she went through. But if we pressurize too much, it might hamper her recovery. Mr. Rafsan, have you seen any change in her? Yes, of course. To be honest, my Neela isn’t the same anymore. But I have accepted it. I’m trying to understand what she went through. I understand that it will take a long time for her to recover. Honestly, I’m just glad that she is back. I didn’t mean it that way. My point is: we think she is hiding something from us. She is either hiding something or lying to us. Why do you think that? That’s what we are trying to find out. Will you take a look at this photo? Everyone knows him. If I am not wrong, he is the famous villain of the Bangladesh movie industry: Misha Shaodagar. Yes. But there’s a story behind this sketch. Whenever we ask her about her molesters, she describes this person to our sketch artist. But, officer, isn’t that normal for a person who isn’t mentally sane right now? We are putting much pressure on her, it can happen. Listen, I will suggest that you keep your eyes opened. If you notice any change, please let us know. Mr. Rafsan? Nothing. I just feel bad for Neela. My heart is on fire I can’t think of anything. My heart is on fire I can’t think of anything. My mind is under a storm I can’t stop them anyway. My mind is under a storm I can’t stop them anyway. My heart is on fire I can’t think of anything. Look into me and my heart, Look into me and my heart. I am all empty inside. My mind is under a storm I can’t stop them anyway. My mind is under a storm I can’t stop them anyway. My heart is on fire I can’t think of anything. My heart is on fire to ashes. Boss is suspecting me. Why didn’t you tell me that Neela was a lefty? I didn’t know. I haven’t noticed actually. Whatever, we got the final warning. We must hurry. How many days would it take to get the papers of the DPS? How can I say this? Is it that easy? But not much. Mr. Rafsan believes me. He has accepted that I am Neela. That’s our plus point. I feel bad for him sometimes. I can’t believe one person can love another person this much. He seriously loves Neela. He told me that Borsha suspects me. He also said, “if Borsha says anything, don’t feel bad.” He also suggested that I spend more time with her. I said, “of course. No problem” That’s good. Rafsan is unknowingly helping us. We are bad people. Evil. Why are we like this brother Nuru? Good or bad is a relative term. Only God knows who’s good and who’s bad. Understood. We can’t stay here for long. Hit the paddle. Rafsan. Neela I can’t see anything. Can you please help me to wear these? Hello? Brother, I’ll prove that this girl isn’t Neela. What do you mean? She had a birthmark on her right shoulder. Whenever she wore sleeveless, it was visible. Yes I know. She is my wife. Of course I remember it. Have you seen that after this girl arrived here? No, I haven’t. Why are you so concerned about it? The birthmark is where it is supposed to be. I will check it right now if this girl really has it or not. If she doesn’t have it, The police officer is on standby. Pick up the phone, please, I pray. Don’t do anything. Wait for me to get home. You are taking it too far. What happened? Sir, I’ll be right there. Go home. Don’t take the U-turn. Go straight and then left. Don’t rush. Borsha, who are they? Why are they here? Nothing much. I have a plan to reduce your mental stress and cure your trauma. What do you mean? Nothing. Just cooperate. Where is Rafsan? Let me call him. What kind of behavior is this? Don’t try to do anything. Just cooperate with us, ok? Borsha what are you doing? Give me my phone. Let me go! Let go of me. Hello? I’m sending it. Is everything alright? Sister? Are you still mad at me? I am really sorry. If you say this one more time, I will seriously. I have good news for you. The Neela Haque missing case is officially closed. Really? Thank you so much. Please stay for dinner. Of course, I will not miss your cooking by any means. It might happen again like Mr. Rashed’s programme. Yes, finish off your fingers this time. Thank you. Nuru. Yes sir? You have to go to Savar at my friend’s house. I am forwarding you the address. You have to pick up something. Shall I go right now, sir? Yes. How is it? Good? Have you eaten? How was it? Hey, clean that table. I know that you are not Neela. I've known about it since the first day. And why won’t I? Can a person return from the dead? When I first saw you, I was wondering what you want? It didn’t take me much time to find out. I have saved you at every stage for my interest. Because if your identity is established as Neela, no one will look for the real Neela. I could have never recovered the one crore taka from the bank. Because it would’ve required Neela’s death certificate. How can I manage the death certificate of someone I’ve murdered? Now I will recover that money through you, the fake Neela. I loved my Neela so much. When she confessed her unfaithfulness, I couldn't take it. Neela begged for my forgiveness and wanted to start fresh in this very hotel kitchen. But I couldn’t forgive her. Because I have no sympathy for the traitor. Luckily all the kitchen stuffs were gone, so my murder wasn’t noticed by anyone. But I was in trouble with Neela’s dead body. Because I was smart enough to understand that I’ll receive death penalty if the police find out. But then someone whispered in my ear,”Rafsan haque can’t cook bad.” The dinner party of Rashed Chawdhury’s son’s marriage took place in our hotel the next day. I thought to myself, “I’ll serve the best dinner of my life tonight.” I cut Neela to pieces with my expert hands. Then I cooked and served. People still remember that day. Nuru tried to betray me too. He is facing the consequences as of right now. You’ll be lonely after he is gone. But you have betrayed me too. But I haven’t decided what I should do with you. Maybe I’ll let you live as my wife. Maybe I’ll kill you too. But this time, I’ll not be hasty. I don’t want to think about it now. People are loving my delicious cooking. Let’s just enjoy that scene.
