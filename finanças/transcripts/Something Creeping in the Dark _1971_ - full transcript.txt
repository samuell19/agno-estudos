Helen certainly picked a great night to unveil her new nose. Helen's my best friend. I hope she looks like a rhinoceros! I can't see a damn thing in this storm. Don't drive too fast. Plastic surgery! She could've sent us a photo instead of inviting us to one of her stupid parties. Don't tell me you'd have preferred to stay at home... Wallowing in our pleasant marriage! You're fantastic! Finally, something we agree on. Anyway, going out on a night like this proves one thing... We've escaped from an asylum! 'Something Creeping in the Dark' But, honey, you could've told me you didn't want to go! Don't make me laugh! Of course I could have... But to who? The servant? The road is slippery. I'm warning you, Sam, we can't lose him. It must be another one of Helen's guests... All of them distinguished by a special virtue. Keep your comments to yourself, they're not even funny. Another candidate for a suicide! Why don't they use gas? It's cheaper. Stop, or I'll shoot! You wouldn't want to blow your chances of promotion, would you, Inspector? Don't push me, Spike... I would just love not having to bother you with a trial. So I have a choice! A bullet in my head, or a rope around my neck? Sam, turn the car around, we're going back. You're on the ball Spike. You're educated... You always know when to deliver the punchline. You'd be an interesting subject for those crazy psychoanalysts... But for me you're nothing but an asshole and a dirty murderer! Relax! I promise I'll behave. At least for now. Get rid of that cigarette. And don't kid yourself, your career is over. Really? You know, Inspector, you never can tell. Signal with the headlights. You get in the car! What the hell are they doing? You'd better slow down, probably an accident. If it's one of those nuts from before then I'm going to enjoy this. I'm a police Inspector. I'm afraid you'll have to turn back. How come? You have to turn back, the bridge has collapsed. - An accident? - No, nothing. You'll have to find another route, I'll follow you back. - Can I smoke? - No. If I'm not mistaken, there's another bridge before we reach the city. Want to bet, Inspector? Your Helen's going to be waiting quite a while... Her nose might grow even longer while she's waiting! Don't get your hopes up! We'll take a longer route, but we'll get there! That's one thing you can't keep me from doing, darling; hoping! Stop. What's happening? I'm in a hurry! Let me pass. Impossible. The bridge has been washed away. That's impossible! I have to perform an urgent operation. It's a matter of life or death! Then get moving, you can take the other road. It's all flooded back there, even the road is completely underwater. You're Inspector Wright, aren't you? - I must find a way to the hospital! - Can't you radio for help? It's true! What are you waiting for? Unfortunately, that's my private car, it's not equipped with a radio. Aren't there any houses around here? I was just about to say... Not far from the bridge, I noticed a house with illuminated windows... It might be an idea. The important thing is if they have a telephone... I'm also in a hurry, Doctor. - How do you know me? - I've heard about you, Inspector. But we'd better get moving now. - Maybe it's abandoned? - I don't suffer from hallucinations! - What do you want? - We're stuck... - The roads are all flooded. - Go somewhere else. Just a minute! I'm a police Inspector... And this is an emergency. Do you have a telephone? Over there. Excuse me, Inspector, but I must call the hospital immediately... - I told you, it's an urgent case! - Mine too, believe me. Hello? Police Headquarters... It's urgent. Yes. This is Inspector Wright... Put me through to the Chief. Hello? Listen here, I've captured Spike... Yes! But hurry up! Who is this Spike? A homicidal maniac, at least, that's what the papers say. Magnificent! We're in good company! Finally! Listen, I've got Spike and I need help. Yes, I'm stuck in a house along with some other people, I'll give you the address... Hello? Hello? Hello?! God damn it! The line's dead. Hello? - I'm afraid you'll have to put us up. - You can't stay. Is this what they call human solidarity? I repeat, you cannot stay. In that case I'll have to use my authority. If you assume full responsibility, then make yourselves at home. It's not your fault, Doctor, but it's too late now... It's pointless letting it get to you. Right. Pointless. Sit over there. And you'd better behave! Well? Who's next door? Nothing. People passing through... They've been trapped by the storm. They'll spend the night here. We've all been introduced, it's true. But what does that mean? We've exchanged names, that soon we'll forget... People like us can do a lot more, for example... Organize the most interesting erotic games that the imagination can come up with. Don't you agree? Just think... Following your instincts and expressing yourselves with utmost sincerity... Knowing we'll never meet each other again. Wouldn't it be fascinating? We're a bit like survivors on a deserted island. - Assholes. - Be quiet! But why? He obviously gets it! Silvia, cut it out! You're not in your club! Inspector, have you ever arrested anyone for not having a sense of humour? We could play a less enjoyable game, Ms. Forest... Like looking for a way out! There must be another road around here, or even a path. The entire area is in a disastrous condition... And it's even more dangerous in the dark. Excuse me, Inspector, but we're not under martial law here... We're all free to stay or go. They'll send help at dawn. We're safe here... So I'm asking you all to co-operate. Well said, Inspector. Your little speech has warmed us all up... And here I see the perfect remedy! Seeing as I have to surrender. No one else joining us? Or do I have to ask the boss for permission? Don't be shy. What was more important to you Doctor? The patient's life, or the success of the operation? Do you think death is the end of everything? I was forgetting that you're an expert in philosophy, professor. What do you think? Don't be so modest! I bet you're in love with the Doctor but you don't have the courage to tell him! How dare you! - Why? I would be! - Here we go. You're barking up the wrong tree, dear. Isn't there anyone here who can play the piano? Where do you think you're going? He's not harming anyone, Inspector... The situation is starting to get very interesting! That's enough! Tell me how does it feel to kill? Do you think you could really understand? Tied to a thousand prejudices, a thousand fears, a thousand superstitions... No, you live a life of vanity and compromise. You'll never understand what it means... To free yourself of all the hypocrisy and stupidity of this decadent world! - You'll never understand! - And why not? - Because you're swimming in it. - Sit down, that's enough! Ready to judge and condemn others... Without any pity or revolting sentimentality! Then you know you're superior! The evening has got off to an exciting start... Come on, gentlemen, what's next on the menu? That's enough, Silvia! You could use a tranquillizer. And you can go to hell as well! Look what I found, who do you think it could be? Lady Sheila Marlow, the former owner of this house. She was quite a remarkable character. One of the most beautiful women in the world... With an exuberant temper. It wasn't only men who were fascinated by her... Even women were jealous and envious... But they were subjugated. However, she was also a woman known for her violent outbursts. You're certainly well informed. She met a tragic fate, in mysterious circumstances... She was known as a human being with destructive impulses... - Diabolical. - The Marlow trial... She was accused of killing her husband... But she was acquitted due to a lack of evidence. - Did you know her? - Who didn't? Above all, they said she dabbled in black magic... And forbidden rituals! But perhaps you can tell us a bit more about her, Joe? She used to hold seances. They became an obligatory ritual. In this very room! She used that table over there. Why not? Why don't we try, Professor Lawrence? She might have something interesting to say! What do you mean? A seance! I must confess, I've always been interested in the occult. Besides, it's a good way to pass the time. - Donald? - No, don't be silly, Silvia... We're not at... Come on, Donald. Don't be so hostile. Not this time. Absolutely not! If I've understood correctly, you intend to invoke Sheila Marlow? - My husband is a good medium. - You'll need three or four people. Fine. Who wants to participate? - You, Inspector? -Your games don't interest me. You're a real party pooper! Doctor? This type of morbid exaltation can be harmful to the nerves... - As a doctor, I don't recommend it. - Are you afraid, perhaps? We invoke you. From the place you have been sent, come to us! In the name of Anachol, Sardi, Sarmeik. Hold hands. I don't understand, I can feel she's here... But she's not able to reveal herself. Please don't fight it, it will be worse. Always dark! Always! The light is fading! Who are you? Who summons me? I can't see you! I will return into the darkness. Let me hear your voices! Show yourselves! Stop! Let go! I'll never forgive you! Stop it! You're lucky, Inspector. Have a look at this. Do you think I would've got far? The house is surrounded by water. I'm warning you for the last time, Spike... Don't try that again. If you want my advice, don't try that again. Take this. You'll feel better. You and your pills. This is the best medicine, Doctor! Certainly! I noticed you've cured yourself very well with it! By the way, you're the only person we don't know anything about... - Where were you going? - I was coming here. You mean to say... You mean to say, right here?! Let's say, around here. Not far. Everything is both near and far, in a certain sense. If you say so. Tell me, you and the doctor are friends of the professor, is that right? Not exactly. It's strange, we only met him a few hours ago... He was on the road, and he asked us for a ride... His car was stuck. You're welcome to use this room. - Aren't there any bedrooms? -Yes, but not enough for everybody. Thank you, Joe. You can go. Here. Tie him to the chair. From now on, we'll have to be very careful... I don't like what's occurred. What's your opinion, Professor? You noticed the bolt of lightning striking the window at that moment... According to the theories of certain spiritualists... When a seance is interrupted like that... The invoked spirit is inextricably linked to the place... And the people who are part of it. I don't mean to offend you, Professor... But I don't believe it's the right time to discuss such foolishness. That's right, Inspector, world progress depends on this. - On what? - On differences of opinion! Joe, the candles! I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did... The entire line must have fallen. I've never seen such stupid people! The look on that girl's face with the glasses! She looked so scared! Like it was the end of the world. - What did you say? - I thought you weren't coming back... So I went to have a look. Confess! You're not so brave yourself! Stop it, you idiot. This isn't funny... I told you to stay here! I'm tired of always being treated like this! This isn't how I planned on spending the night. You should get some rest, Professor, there's still another room free. I usually don't sleep much, besides I'm curious about this book. I'm coming, Sam. - I don't want it to get too dark here. - Thank you, Inspector. Come in. Excuse me, dear. I hope I'm not disturbing you... But I noticed you were the only one of us with a suitcase... And I was hoping you could help me... You wouldn't by any chance happen to have... - A hair brush? - Yes, of course! It's a question of habit, you know. Here. Is that okay? You have very good taste. I never have time for such things, my sister buys them for me. - Tell me, were you afraid? - The Inspector said we're safe here. But I was referring to what happened earlier... Wasn't it exciting? It's a question of calm nerves. Would you like a tranquillizer? You never need them, right? If it wasn't for the chiming of those clocks... I'd say time was standing still. There are many things between Heaven and Earth... That do not concur with your philosophy, Professor. - I don't know what happened to me! - Why did you scream? I felt like I was going deaf! - Doctor, when did you leave you room? - What are you getting at? - It was only a question. - Why deny it? I got the same impression, Inspector... You didn't? - Where is your husband? - Out there. Donald isn't what you would call the courageous type. Where were you just now? Are you the hotel detective? I have a complaint... The service here is rotten, and the chamber maids are ugly. I could tell you a joke as well... But I'm afraid the one that fits would be far too obscene for you! Are you okay, honey? Come on, relax... Violence isn't your strong point, and we both know that only too well! When I heard the screaming I thought it would be better to stay here and wait. Nothing but a small case of hysterics, women are like that! You did well to stay here. From now on, no matter what happens... Wait for me. And always keep your eyes open! You seem strange. Don't you feel well? Susan, why don't you answer? Doctor Williams. - Could I have another pill? - These sedatives are rather strong. However... - You can take another one. - Thank you. - Susan. - Don't touch me. - Don't touch me. - What happened? I'm almost afraid to ask you. What happened Susan? I don't know. I can't remember. What do you mean you can't remember? That horrible sensation, creeping up my skin... Like a slimy snake... Like something repulsive. That engulfs you, with no escape. I don't know, there's something monstrous in this house... I'm reminded of what Professor Lawrence said... These absurd suggestions are getting to me as well! Forgive me, Susan, I didn't mean to frighten you. - The door! - What's wrong? Calm down. We're alone. The door opened I remember now! Everything's fine. Don't be afraid... From now on, you wont be alone any more. Look who's here! What is it? Do you want a pill for your migraine? I can't remember the last time you visited me at this hour of the night. Sam, can I get a drag? Be careful, Sam! - Can I have a look? - You like looking at monkeys in cages? - Is it safe? - Sure. After you. You must be in real trouble, friend. Want some expert advice? Maybe... Maybe I need it right now. You're an expert, especially at killing. And no one's going to disturb us now! Don't hate me because your wife wants something I've got... That's her problem! Well... Let's say it's your problem! Stand up. What's going on tonight? Have you suddenly remembered that you're my husband? Why are you standing there like that? Why don't you answer? What's the matter, Donald? Please... Donald! Joe? Oh my god! How long have you been here? Dead! A broken neck. To tell the truth the screaming took me by surprise... Maybe I hesitated for a few seconds... But not more. Don't move. I'll be right back. I just don't understand! Don't knock at Hell's door, or it might open! - Were you in your room, Ms. West? - Of course! Why? Did you hear anyone come in here? Voices? I'm not sure but I only heard Ms. Forest. Only hers? Are you sure? - At least, it seemed that way to me. - Never mind... It all seems clear enough to me! - You think it was Mr. Forest? - Who else? Aside from the fact that he's disappeared... I don't think he's the type to commit such a crime. Perhaps he was concealing paranoid tendencies? Either way, it's better if you all return to the reception. And stay there until I've found him! I just don't understand... I had already given him a strong tranquilizer. And not long ago he himself asked me for another one. Strange! A dose strong enough to put a horse to sleep! Something must have triggered something in his brain... Throwing his nerves off balance. A neurotic's reactions are often unpredictable. Ms. West is right... Not everything can have a logical scientific explanation. - Did you find him? - Unfortunately, not... I have a feeling he is no longer in the house. - What do you mean? - That he's trying to escape... - With all the darkness and flooding... - Are you sure? The attic! - Inspector, Spike got away! - What? That lunatic Forest hit me, he must have freed him. You wait here. We're up against Spike as well. - It can't be! - What? Inspector. - Don't talk, keep calm - Forest, why did you do it? Where... Where is my wife? Where is my wife? Sheila. Who shot me? Who was it? Doctor! Doctor! Help me! He's dead. I don't understand, all he did was lie to us. - No man lies when he's about to die! - He was delirious, that's all. I tell you that man was lucid when he spoke! Do you recognise this gun? Sure, it belonged to Lady Marlow. How do you think it got into Forest's hands? I really can't say. I hope you don't expect me to believe that Forest knew where to find it? What you do or don't want to believe, doesn't concern me... But I know for a fact that during the trial... ...the police looked everywhere for that pistol... And up to now, it's never been found. How was Forest able to find it? And after so much time? I don't want to be the one who finds out. Do you happen to have another cigarette? Sorry, it's my last one. If you want... No, it doesn't matter, thank you. Doctor. I can't get it out of my mind... The gun appeared from nowhere! And the desperate expression on Forest's face before he died! His last words. Forest was nothing less than a victim... We are all in the shadow of extraordinary influences. There's nothing extraordinary about it! A man murders his wife... He hated her and was just waiting for the slightest provocation... Then he happened to find that gun and turned it on himself. You're forgetting what he said before he died! - The ramblings of a madman. - You can't prove that! You're only saying that because it suits you. I felt sorry for him... It was as though he'd woken up from a bad dream. Like someone forced to act against their own will. I don't want pursue that angle any more, Professor! Let's change the subject. What happened to Forest could happen again. But it would be foolish of me to think you'll listen. Quite right. I advise you all to stay here together... And don't leave, for any reason! There's a dangerous criminal on the loose. That's what I wanted to say as well... If we stay together we can prevent someone else becoming possessed. I envy your calm, Professor. I've simply learnt to accept the inevitable. There's still something undefinable in the air... I feel it, it's like a threat. Who is it? Were you scared? I always knew there was something wrong with you. Why are you looking at me like that? What's got into you? Have you gone mad? - And if I was? - It's a stupid joke! - You think so? - Cut it out! There are already two bodies, they were murdered here... What do you say? Anything can happen before dawn! What's that supposed to mean? Do you know who is with those people? Spike! Someone who enjoys killing... Someone with a reputation. But there are many others like him around... They seem normal, and at the right time... Please, Joe! That's enough! I could free myself of you now... I'll never get another chance like this! I could kill you, throw your body in the water out there... A flood always claims many victims! Let me see you scream! Let me see! Imbecile! - Wait! - Join the others if you're afraid! Don't leave me alone! Inspector, I think I saw Spike at my window. You think so? I'll ask Sam to have a look. I'll keep searching here... Who's there? Why don't you stay with us for a while... We'd feel safer with you here. I'm sorry, but I'm in the mood for conversation right now. You ought to rest, your nerves are shot. Why don't you mind your own business! There... That's it... Everyone should mind their own business! Everyone in their place! Service has no limit. Spike! Damned bastard! Doctor Williams, you're the only one I can trust... There's been another murder, Spike has killed Sam... He's armed and I have to stop him! No matter what! Okay, but what can I do? -Stay here and be ready for anything! Take it. You might need it. - When will this nightmare end? - It'll be dawn soon. What is it that forces a man to kill? What turned Forest into a murderer and then made him take his own life? Nowadays it is frowned upon to think a person can be possessed... But the past and present intertwine and the answer is found only in the future. There are too many things that we don't yet understand. It's over. That's right. It's dawn, Doctor. What do you think Inspector? Was it a collective Hallucination... Or could it be that a frightening reality does exist outside of ourselves? - I don't know. - That's right. We aren't meant to know... Only to believe, or not believe. A helicopter!
