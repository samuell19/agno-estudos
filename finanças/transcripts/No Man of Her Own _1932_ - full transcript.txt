- Well, I might as well. - Oh, they shadow us. - So, when the bank extended the $50,000... - And you? I think I'll take the next three please and... Oh, be quiet, Uncle. - Give me three good ones. - Well, I'm not particular. - Thanks. - You give me the next two. Ok. One for me. Oh, I think you're a lot of meanies not letting me win. Never mind, unlucky at cards... No one loves Mr. Stewart. It's hereditary. No woman ever had anything to do with my father. A bee kissed a sunflower and Mr. Stewart was born. - Can I help you? - I guess I need it. Look... And I had my heart all set on winning $1,000 for a fur jacket with a fox collar. Oh, we can't allow that tragedy. - I hate to break it up, but... - Yeah, won't run, you can't force them. - Last hand, eh? - Beginner's... - God bless you. - Excuse me. Yeah well, as I was saying, the bank extended the $50,000 to us... even though we showed a 100,000 ton loss on our books. Well, there's always the personal angle on a loan. Oh, when you big businessmen get together? Uncle Charlie, I just knew you and Mr. Morton would take to each other. Say darling, is it my foot you're trying to caress? No ducky Mr.Morton's foot and mine have secrets. Pass. - I'll open without looking. - Well, I'll raise. - I'll stay. - Me too. - I raise. - Come again. Oh, I haven't a big hand but... give you a chance, make it the biggest pot of the evening. - Once more. - Another stack please. - That makes eight, doesn't it? - Exactly. And still once more. Oh, I'm going to make this good for you. I call. I only have aces and kings. Well, that's what I've got. Aces and kings and 10 next. Then who wins? You do, you heartless wretch Jack next. Jack next? Here I had queens full and he, has anyone got a gun? Oh, put that away, let's store our chips back in the middle.. I should say not. Oh, but it was too high a limit, just a friendly little game. Here, I'll tell you what. - Cut the cards to see whether I tear them... - Oh, no. - Oh, no, it's bad luck. - You watch out, we'll get you next time. - Won't we? - I hate to do this. And I did so want to bring you luck. Don't worry, I'm giving you $1,500 toward that $1,000 coat. All right Mary. - Good night Miss Everly. - Good night. Good night dear girl. Good night Uncle Charlie. Good night Miss Everly, nice of you to let your uncle ask us up. Good night. Good night. - Great girl that niece of yours. - Oh, yeah. Thanks for looking after her while I was away. Oh Mr. Stewart, I expect that order from you by next Friday, don't forget. If you'll promise to play cards with me again and don't win this back. Did you ever hear that one about the couple? So he said, but honey, we have to eat sometimes. Can I give you a lift Mr. Morton? No, thank you, I'll walk. I'm only a couple of blocks. - How about you Mr. Stewart? Going downtown? - No, thanks, I go the other way. - Mr. Vargas? - Thank you, I walk uptown. - Good night Mr. Stewart. - Good night Mr. Morton. - Good night Mr. Vane. - Good night Mr. Stewart. - Good night. - Good night Mr. Vargas. Good night. - Good night Mr. Vane. - Good night Mr. Morton. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. - Good night Vargas. - Good night. Good night. - Oh there, good night Mr. Vargas. - Good night Mr. Morton. Babe. Well, you fishcake. Get some tomato sauce for this guy, will you Vargas? - Feed him to the cat. - What I do now? Can't even stack a deck of cards straight. After being with me for three years Jack next against his 10. What then? Make it look phony? I always told you, I don't want it that close to the big pot. One card slipped there wrong and throw the whole thing out. I think Charlie has a blonde on the brain. Yeah, that adenoid dame on the boat is got him by the tonsils. - Oh, you leave my tonsils out of it. - And another thing. Do I have to tell you at this late date... that when I sneeze and pull the cold deck out of my handkerchief... that's a signal for you to gab with a come on? Take his eyes away? Well, I did. You didn't grab his eyes for 10 seconds after the sneeze. Do I have to send you to sneezing school? All right boss, if you want to break up. Sure, break bottle up three ways. What do I get? The cork? Now, you boys aren't leaving, are you? - Wasn't even thinking about it. - Well, you are. Babe and I have some business. - All right niecey, business before pleasure. - Never mind the wisecracks. And next time you play uncle, cut out those wet kisses, here. Your checks bozos. You're sure Morton's check won't bounce back? I lined up Morton, didn't I? I told you he's President of the Riverside Bank. There you go, it'll bounce back sure. A bank president? Endorse it over to you so he can't stop payment. Cash it in the morning. You know, you could raise that check by just adding a wai. Now, don't start anything crooked Charlie, let's shove off. You're sticking around Babe. Oh, I haven't seen you in a month. Listen kid... that thing you've got on is pretty thin but I've got tough skin see and I don't feel it. All right, let's have it. Who you meet on that boat? The steward's grandmother and did she have it. Some woman with you, that's why you wouldn't let me cross with you. And those radiograms you sent me, you know you set the boat on fire? - Charlie had to spit twice to put it out. - Three times. Oh, I got to see you for five minutes, it's important, I tell you. Babe, I miss you so. You can't let me down this way after what we've been to each other. You know what gets me, is why women can't laugh when it's over. Was all right, wasn't it? What you bawling about? When you joined up with us, it was a business proposition, pure and simple. - Keep it simple, will you? - Why did you make love to me? - Go on, tell me. Why did you? - You know I'm a hit and run guy. Never going to have to comb any gal out of my hair. I'm free, see? And ankle chains give me the jitters. Not even answering my radiograms. I ever tell you I love you? You bet I didn't, I'm a square shooter. I tell you, you can't walk out on me now, I won't let you. Think you're a big wag, don't you? Well, if you walk out on me now it's for good. I knew you were a good sport. I'll ditch the whole works, I'll go to Morton, I'll tell him... Sure you'll go to the police, the newspapers, I'll play it on my drum. - I'll jump off this roof, believe me. - I can't depend on you. You'll probably have your chance to talk now. Oh, how are you Mr. Collins? Nice to see you. Thought it was you Mr. Stewart, saw you in the hall. - I have friends in the building. - I am glad you dropped in. Sit down, let me mix you a drink. Oh, excuse me Mr. Collins, Miss Everly, my fiancée. - How do you do? - I met Mr. Collins on the boat, going over. That's funny, on the boat coming back too, coincidence. Oh, card game, eh? Didn't know you like cards Stewart. - Didn't see you touch them on the boat. - I never play cards with strangers. - You know those sharks on ocean liners. - Beautiful crossing, wasn't it? - Smoothest sailing boat I've ever been on. - Funny. Doing nothing but bump into old friends tonight. Just ran across Morton downstairs. - Morton? Really? Just left here. - Yeah. - He told me you had a little card game. - Friends for years. Well Babe, you're not going to get away with it this time. I've wised up Morton plenty about you and your crowd. I don't know what you're talking about. But if you want to make a pitch, go ahead. - Get someone to book your charge. - I know how you work. Morton won't stand front page stuff. His daughter is being married next week. But when I get through with him, he'll be seeing it my way. And I'll be seeing you, so long. Babe, sure wish you'd take me with you. All right, all right, won't say it again. I told you, I want you to keep your eyes on Collins and your fist on Kay. You really think she'd go to the DA? Well, unless she trips over a new brand of kisses in a hurry. I can't take a chance. Well, heads a boat, tails a train. Train it is, I never go back on a coin. - Hello? - Mr. Collins to see Mr. Stewart. Collins. - Ask him up. - Up? Up. - Send Mr. Collins up. - Well, that's life. - Some go up, while others go down. - Well, don't forget, wire me where. $2.60. - How long will it take? - Two and a half hours. - And what time is the train? - 2:30 track 90 right as you go out the door. Glendale, one ticket, round trip please. Hello? Oh, hello George. Oh, I've been busy leading my usual life of sin. No, there's nothing wrong because there's nothing right. Well, what's been happening exciting? The drugstore get in the banana flavor ice cream yet? No, no, I can't. I'm going up to the lake. Oh, just a little holiday. No, George, I'm not sore at you. I wish I were, then there be some hope. Sure, I like you George, but where do we go from there? I'll see you sometime, give me a ring. Bye. Well never, such talk. The lake, did you say? - Who all going to the lake? - Oh, just the gang. Well, you're not, no daughter of mine. It's ridiculous. Bunch up there in the woods overnight, no chaperone. Drinking and who knows what? Is dreadful. Mother, I wish you were right but you're not. - I don't think you ought to go Connie. - Now, is that a way to be firm with her? She isn't going. Mother, I've just got to do something soon. - If this keeps up... - If what keeps up? That's just it, nothing. Nothing ever happens. Sometimes I go out in the woods and scream, just to keep from bursting. - Just like her Aunt Hatty. - Oh, Hatty is all right. Yes, I suppose she gets those diamonds clerking. Well, at least she gets them, more power to her. Oh, if I disappear someday, you'll know I ran off... with the first traveling salesman didn't have gold teeth. - Go to the movies. - He will not, Willie, Willie... Ma, I bought you a lace frill, I thought it'd help trim up your black dress a bit. - Why, thank you Connie. - Bye Pa. And I take back what I said about the traveling salesman. He can have false teeth and wear a girdle. Madam, you want to make your little home here in Glendale attractive, don't you? - I'm sorry, it can't be done. - But we... But madam, you don't understand our product. Sorry, thank you, good morning. - I'll bet you. - All right, I'll bet you. - There, didn't I tell you? - It'll come next time. - Oh, you can't win on this machine. - Wait a minute. - Just wasting your money mister. - Yeah? - Told you so. - Now put your nickel in. - Not going to waste any more of my money. - No, no, no go on, next one is a jackpot. All right, if I lose... Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. - We ought to go whacks on that. - That's what you say. Hey, come back here. - Hello Connie. - Hello. - Hello Connie. - Hello George. Thanks George. Who's the live wire? It's Connie Randall, the librarian, cute trick. - The old boy, is she a handful? - Yeah? - Mattie, this gentleman would like a book. - Right over there. Thank you. - Name? - Jerry Stewart. - Address? - Palace Hotel. - Will you remain here long? - Eh? - Well, that all depends. - References? Ask anybody. Do I've to get through all this to get a book? - Well, you see, it's only a matter of... - Or you can make a deposit. 2 dollars, which will be refunded when you return the book. Thank you, here's your card. And thank you. - Are you familiar with the library? - No. Well then, if you'll follow me. - What kind of book do you want? - I don't know. What could you suggest? Well, there's poetry. - Well... - Drama? No. Fiction? No. Well, would you like Shakespeare? Oh, Shakespeare is all right but you know how it is... Some nights you just don't feel like Shakespeare. No. Do your eyes bother you? - No, why? - They bother me. - What kind of a book would you like? - Do you keep Einstein? - Now tell me, you really want a book or... - Sure, sure, I want a book. History of France? No. Junior Classics? No, no. Between Two Thieves... - Mister, whatever your name is. - Stewart. - Stewart, I'm sorry, I'm very busy. - I'm sorry too. You'll find everything you want, if you don't find what you want you... can call me and I'll come try and take care of it. - Miss Randall, can I have the key to... - Yes. Oh Miss Randall, can I have that book up there? - History? - Well, that, that blue. - The Land of Romance? - Oh, no, no, no. That blue. - The British Isles? - No, no. Are you showing me a grand time mister or are you showing me a grand time? - No. Oh, excuse me. - I refuse to. But you're the librarian, you got to tell me what time you close. - Stick around and find out. - All right. That's a date. Just the New York cowboy, aren't you? Passing through and giving the little small town girl her big moment. You'd be lovely to have around, just to sprinkle the flowers with your personality. That twinkle in your eye. Wrap it up for me, will you? - You could be nice, try it sometime. - I'd even be nice, if you liked it. You write the words and the music, don't you? - Clever girl. - Yes, I thought I told you that. Oh, I forgot to mention, my father is a farmer with a long beard. Well, of course you knew that. Bring the Brooklyn Bridge over, I'm sure you can sell it to him. You are a salesman? - Oh, really? - Oh, no, no, no, I was only kidding. Say look, see you at 9 o'clock. Sure of yourself, aren't you? I wouldn't be if I was sure of you. Have a date. I have a steady date every night, my bed. That's Glendale. Ra-Ra-Ra. It's the freshest specimen that ever stepped in this library. And he asked me to go out with him. Is he looking? No. You sure? You do want to go out with him, don't you Connie? - He is nice, isn't he? - He's reading now. - Make sure. - He's reading. He has lovely dimples, hasn't he? Did you notice? - And when he smiles at you... - Oh, go ahead Connie. No, I'm not going to fall for the first stranger in town. And anyway, you have to play hard to get with him. That's not the way I treat my young man. I've always been frank and aboveboard. You're such a nice person Mattie. Oh, I know his breed, he's so used to having girls say yes. No Mattie, the girl who lands him will have to say no and put an anchor on it. But isn't it tough when all you can think of is yes? - Where do you suppose he's gone? - Oh, out I guess, what did you expect? Oh well, will you turn the lights out back there? You scared me. It's time to go, we'll be closing. It's 9 o'clock. What do you do with all the hearts you break, eh? Connie, Connie, are you ready? - Connie. - Just a minute. You shouldn't have done that. I must go and you must go. See you in church. ♪ Praise God from whom all blessings flow. ♪ ♪ Praise him all creatures here below. ♪ I'll bet Mr. Stewart doesn't hear any better preaching in New York than he heard today. I am afraid you are right Mrs. Randall. - And thanks for inviting me over. - Of course, you're quite welcome. This ice cream is cream, not the skimmed milk you get in the city. You don't have to tell me that. Would you like some cake? No, thank you. Ma, I just can't make my ice cream and cake come out even. Oh, Willie, he's just a boy. - What time you go up the lake Connie? - Going on a trip somewhere? Yeah, she's going up to Lake Inspiration with Charlie. Oh, I see. The Get Together Club goes up there every year, it's just a little crowd and... - dancing, running, games, you know. - Sounds interesting. I'd... Oh no, you wouldn't like it. Oh no, you wouldn't like it at all. Of course not. It's too lonesome, no subway, no elevator, none of the rush and noise of the city. Just pale moon, quiet lake. Soft breeze hardly rustling the pine leaves. - You'd be bored to death. - It sounds terrible. There's the telephone, guess that's Charlie now. Quite a crowd goes up to the lake, I suppose. Yes, it's a nice little crowd, they all grow up together. - Oh, yeah? - You're right Emma, just a minute. It's for you Mr. Stewart, long distance. - Excuse me. - Certainly. Pard me. Oh, right over there. Thank you. Connie... If you must go to the lake, by heaven's sake don't ask Mr. Stewart. Those hoodlums, drinking and card playing, he'll get the wrong impression of you. - Well, I didn't ask him Mother. - Oh no, you didn't ask. Quiet lake, pale moon, pine trees. Soft breezes. It's acute you mug, very acute, get me? I have some unfinished business that simply must be attended to. Yeah, but listen. Kay is gone on that Caribbean trip with Morton. Yeah, they left yesterday. Yeah, so there can't be any action now for two months. Say, hurry back, will you? There's something hot. That's swell Charlie, swell. But there's a frail chance of my getting back just yet. Very frail. Yeah. I suppose half of Glendale goes up to Lake Inspiration, eh? I wouldn't wonder, but if you ask me I... No sense in trekking way up there when the floor is no good to dance on. I could never dance on it. Why, you can pass away the holiday right here in Glendale. Yeah, you can pass away any day in Glendale. Now, let me get this straight. When I come to the three roads, I take the middle one and then I'm Ok, eh? Then you go on to the left fork, then you turn to the right... and follow the stream until you come to Glen Cove. - Then you're right there. - And to the lake? No, to the foot of the mountain. I suppose that's only about eight miles from the lake. - No, it's only four miles. - All right, thank you. Hello? Yes Charlie. No, I didn't walk out, I just didn't feel like dancing, I'm tired. Well, the fun will just have to go on without me, see you tomorrow. - Who is it? - Is this Miss Randall's cabin? - Yes. - Can I come in? Well, just a minute, just a minute. Now you can come in. - What on earth are you doing way up here? - You invited me up, didn't you? - Yes, but I didn't think you'd accept. - I never disappoint a lady. Oh, how thoughtful of you. Well, here I am. Great idea, these cabins. Yeah, I think I will stay for the weekend. Thanks. You wouldn't ruin a lady's reputation, would you? No, no, no. No neighbors, have you? - Pajamas. - Lounging pajamas. - I'm glad you told me. - Well, it was nice of you to call, but... I got to get back to the dance before it breaks up. Come here, you don't want to go back to the dance, eh? Sit down. Now let's talk this whole thing over. Well, why don't you say something? You're awfully sweet. Think so? And that isn't all. - What else? - Oh, a lot of things. Oh, isn't that grand music? - Have a cigarette? - No, thanks. You know, I just love dancing. Oh, it's quite proper, we're dancing. - Come on, you like this. - But I hadn't thought about it. You give me till tomorrow to answer? Please, you don't interest me that way, really. - Doesn't that hurt your pride? - No, you're much too pretty. Of course, I forgot, promised Charlie I'd meet him at the dance. Certainly, why don't you go? Because you fascinate me. You still refuse to be nice, don't you? All right, what is a nice guy do? Sit around and talk? Yes, I know some nice people talk. - Lovely evening, isn't it? - Charming. - You think it'll rain tomorrow? - Well, it probably will, it's a holiday. Now that takes care of the weather. Lovely moon, isn't it? Oh come on, don't spoil my last evening, you know I've to go back to New York tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yeah. - Vacation is over. - Oh, I'm sorry. Well then, why keep kidding around like this? I'm not kidding, only... Well, you just walk in and pick up a girl and walk out. Is that fair? No, no, you're right. Oh well, forget it. Anyway, we've had a little fun, I've seen Glendale. Had a couple of laughs, I'll be seeing you around sometime. So long Connie. Why don't you be a sport? Why don't you give a girl a break? Why don't you take a chance? - I don't get you. - Have you ever gambled? - Yeah, I'll gamble on anything. - Why don't you gamble with me? All right. - Heads, we do, tails, we... - Get married. Right, I never go back on a coin. - I'll ring. - Just call me when you want me sir. Well, here we go. Oh no, it's all right. Yeah? Pull in Grand Central Station in about a half an hour sir. All right. Oh darling, why did we take such a fast train? Come on, we have to get going, come on. Oh, no, no, no. Wait darling, till I get my mules. Well, hurry up, make it snappy. All right, come on. Hello Mr. Stewart, been away? Well, well Mr. Collins, here in person to wish us luck, eh? Well, here she is Mrs. Stewart. - How do you do ma'am? - I'm glad to know you Mr. Collins. - Drop in and see us sometime, will you? - Thanks. I know I've neglected you, it'll be soon now. In the bedroom. - All yours? - Oh, I hope so. - How you like it? - It's lovely. Go on, take a good look. Why don't you take your hat off? - You know you're going to stay a while. - Well, I'd better. Oh, let me look around, will you? I want to see everything. That must be Charlie. - Hello, you mug. - Hello pie-face, how are you? - Oh swell, how's the boy? - How's things, eh? Good. - Come on in, I want you to meet the wife. - The what? - Darling, this is my pal Charlie Vane. - I'm glad to know any of Jerry's friends. And I'm delighted to meet any of his wives. Well, how do you like New York? You don't have to make conversation with Connie, she'll make it with you. Darling, we have some business. Would you like to wash up? How you guess it? Excuse me. Darling, don't keep me waiting too long, I'm liable to get lonesome. All right honey. Liable to get lonesome, all right honey. Oh, who is the Jane? - I tell you, she's my wife. - Ah? - No, no kidding. - Shotgun? - Flip of a coin. - You lost? - Right and I never go back on a coin. - So that's the frail chance. No drinks during the day, you know that. So you're doing fine, winning Janes in a lottery. What you going to do with her? Show her a good time for a while, then... send her back home with a couple of grand, a swell trousseau. She deserves it, she's a good kid and clever. - Darling. - Yes dear? I don't seem to be able to find room for these with all my clothes. Let's give them to Salvation Army, eh? And I think these girls pictures are terrible. Didn't I tell you she was clever? Stick around a while and learn something, it'll do you good. You know, I think I'll take her along on the next game. Oh, we got a party all set for tomorrow night. You were laying low so long. I thought you'd want to get back to work. Vargas guarantees big money. Well, I suppose you bozos know that Collins is on the trail again. - No? - Yeah, met me downstairs. Now we got to pull a twist. From now on, I bow out of the winnings, you deal yourself the winning hand. - Ok. - And no Jacks next to the 10. - Oh, now that wasn't my... - All right, all right. You're sure Morton didn't press those charges? - I told you, Kay has him out on his yacht. - She has him going again? One kiss from her and he wants to turn a handspring. But of course he can't. - See now Babe, if you just... - Yeah, all right Charlie. Now you run along on downstairs and see if the street is still there. I have some unfinished business. And listen, we'll have that game with Vargas tonight, I want to shake columns. You're not really going to bring along that kid from the sticks? Yeah, you wait till you see her all dolled up. You know, I've a hunch she'll make Kay and all the others look like a pair of deuces. All right sailor, on your way, on your way. - Honey... - Oh, don't come in. Say hurry darling, we'll run down and pick up some clothes. I want you to meet some friends of mine tomorrow night, show you off to town. - Do I get the key to the city? - I'm calling the mayor right now. Darling, I've just got to take my shoes off, they're killing me. I took a B width instead of C. Honey, you knocked them dead tonight. What a break for little Connie? The only girl with four men. You can't deny I was the most popular woman there. But I know I should've worn the blue dress instead of this darling. How am I going to wear all those things? - You have to find a way. - But it's fun to go shopping. Let's go again tomorrow, but let's not buy anything. I'll buy you anything I like. Yes and I think I'll let you. What are you? A millionaire or something? Losing 3,000 that way in one evening. I never knew there was that much money in the world. The next time I play I'll win it back, plus some. Vane and Vargas just had the breaks tonight, that's all. Yes, well, from now on I'm bookkeeper in this family. Will you look what Mr. Brent and Mr. Carrington lost? 5,000 dollars between them. Nothing unusual honey, this is New York, anything can happen. I know it's going to happen to Mr. Babe. Going to get some sleep, it's after 3. - You have to work tomorrow. - Work? Oh, yes, yes, yes, I've been on a vacation so long, I almost forgot about work. What time you get up? 7 or 8? Honey, that's too far away for me to think of. All right Mr. Brent. Then you and Mr. Carrington didn't lose that money tonight to Babe Stewart. But you did lose to Charlie Vane and I'm telling you he's one of Babe's outfit. It's just a blind. There won't be any publicity. That fellow belongs in jail and if I can get your help, I'll put him there. I'll keep it out of the papers, I... Then I can't get you to change your mind, eh? - And you better bring extra pot of coffee. - Very well madam. Thank you. Jerry Jerry... Babe. Darling... It's time to get up, breakfast will be right up dear. Oh, I'm sleepy. Honey, close those curtains. You want to be at the office at 8, don't you? I'm on Wall Street, doesn't open till 10, good night darling. - Honey, close those curtains. - Come on, say it now, come on. I love you. That's settled. Darling, don't be funny so early in the morning, I never laugh until I've had my coffee. It's cold. - Honey, get me my bathrobe, will you? - Here it is. - And we're going to bed early tonight too. - Tonight? It isn't even morning yet. Honey honey, what suit do you want me to put out for you? Brown, blue or gray? Lay them all out darling, I'll wear them all. Darling, I wish you didn't have to go to work so early. With you at the office, the days are going to be awfully long. Yeah, that's what I've been thinking. Oh sweetie, don't forget to leave me your telephone number. I want to call you during the day. - Top card. - Charlie. - Charlie. - Eh? What? What's up? - Oh nothing, I just dropped in. - Eh? I've never been up against anything like it in my life, something is got to be done. At half past 8 in the morning? Have you gone mad? Yeah. No. I've been up for an hour. Put out of my house to go to work. Work? Now listen, I don't want to be wakened in the middle of the night to hear funny stories. - What we going to do about that girl? - That's your problem, don't bother me. I'm going to give her some dough and send her back. What? Don't be silly, keep her, she's great, she got it all over Kay. - Yeah, wasn't she great last night? - Oh marvelous, I'd like to be uncle to her. Yeah, I mean, if she works like that in the dark, why don't you let her in on it? - We'll clean up. - No, no, no, can't do that. - Say, what about that South America thing? - Now you're talking. Vargas got another cable last night, where is it? Swell pickings there and we can work the boat going down. - I'll get him over, yeah, yeah. - No, no, that's out. - No? - No, what about Europe? Oh, no, no. - Say, are you going daffy? - Maybe, I don't know. She thinks I'm working, what am I going to do in the daytime? Well, when you make up your mind, write me a letter. You're a lot of help. You... - You don't need another boy, do you? - Eh? No kidding, you know, one does get restless during the day and... Oh, I can't stand it anymore. I got to find a place to park from 10 to 3. Why sure, go ahead and make this your office. No, no, no, I mean it Laidlaw, I'm on the level. Well, I want a desk, you know, with an inkstand and everything. You don't have to pay me and... well, I might be a good customers' man, might bring you a lot of money. Yeah, I think I would find you a desk. Wickersham 2 - 9 - 9 - 6 - 9. Hello? Hello, is that you darling? Look honey, I forgot to give you my phone number. Circle 7 - 1 - 6 - 3 - 3. Yeah, I'll be right with you, I'll take that matter up with you in a second. I'm a little busy dear, yeah. You can always reach me here from 10 to 3. - Honey, what's on your mind? - Nothing darling. - There'll be five men as usual? - Yeap. Who the two extras tonight? Vane and Vargas? Why did you say it that way? Oh, I just naturally supposed they'd be here, they usually are. Come on now, what is on your mind? My card losses? - Is that what's worrying you? - Maybe. Oh then, something is worrying you. Oh, well then... Sometimes I wonder if the men you play with haven't wives and why I never meet them. They don't even come back a second time, is because I'm not a good hostess? - Listen to her carry on. - Oh, I shouldn't have mentioned it. Oh, you look grand darling. - If we weren't married, I'd flirt with you. - Why don't you try it anyway, eh? - Oh, hello Charlie, you're a little late. - I'm the first one here. Hello Connie. - Hello. - Oh dear, fix Charlie a drink, will you? Yes. Where's Vargas? Oh, he's having dinner with our guests, they'll be here any minute. - I want the winning hand tonight. - All right, then I'll deal. You know, I'd like to get up a party some night for Connie. - You know any nice girls? - No, certainly not. You wouldn't. - How is it out? Nice? - Blowing up a little when I came in. Blowing up when I came in. Well, as I was saying, the bank extended the 50,000 to us... even though we showed a 100,000 ton loss. That last pot turned out to be the best of the evening. Vane, I thought you had me with those three eights. Well, showed you what I thought of them but they didn't stand up. There you are Mr. Thomas, 2,150, is that right? - Yes, thank you. - I never saw such luck. - 1,300 for you Mr. Shields. - Yes, thanks. Well, we had a lot of fun anyway, didn't we? - I'm lucky, I broke even. - Good. There you are Mr. Thomas, 4,000. - You know, I'm almost ashamed to take this. - Well, that's all right. Get you the next time. Well, I hope you boys have had as good a time as I have not. - Why didn't you invite me up last week? - Now you can't say I'm not a complete host. Good night Mrs. Stewart, lovely evening. - Night, Stewart. - Good night. - Good night everybody. - Have a nice sleep. - Good night Mrs. Stewart. - Good night Mr. Thomas. - Good night. - Good night. Good night Charlie. - That will be all tonight. - Very well sir. Well, we weren't so lucky tonight, were we? - Jerry, it wasn't Charlie's fault, I... - Oh? Then you did change the cards, didn't you? If you thought I was a crook, why didn't you come out with it... instead of beating around the bush? Where do you come off pulling a stunt like that? Don't you see this just had to happen sooner or later? What had to happen? - My finding out that you were a cheat. - Don't say that to me. Oh, I've been fighting the thought for weeks. - Even your job... - My affairs are my own... and don't butt into them. I thought we were married and your affairs were mine. I kept you out of it, didn't I? This is my racket, I don't have to explain to anybody. As long as you're in it, I'm in it. You don't have to stick with me, I can go along my own way. You don't care for this sort of life any more than I do. You know more about me than I know about myself, don't you? Maybe I do. Maybe I know something about you that you don't know anything about. Maybe I didn't just marry you on the flip of a coin. What's all this got to do with what you did to me tonight? You've just got to decide what you want to do. If you're going to go on your way, it'll just have to be without me. So that's it, is it? Well, I'm through, said all I'm going to say. Can't even trust my own wife. Meddling in my affairs. How do you get that way? Don't wait up for me, I'm going for a walk. - Can I do anything for you Mr. Stewart? - No. Hello Charlie? Listen, have Vargas cable that fellow Ok. Yes, we're leaving for South America Saturday, get it? No, no, no. Never mind about the cards, it wasn't your fault. And try and get an outside suite. Three bedrooms, a sitting room for you and Vargas and me. Ok. Hello Jerry, you're home early. Yeah. - I got some news for you. - Oh, I thought you'd want to talk to me. You didn't say anything last night when you came back and... - And I've been waiting... - I'm leaving for South America tonight. Will you have them send my trunk up please? Well, I guess I'm a funny guy, can't be managed. Well, I get something in my bonnet and... What I am getting at is that I got to go this thing alone, see. I see Jerry. You thought it all out. No, I'm not saying there wasn't a lot of truth in what you said last night but... I'm not alibiing myself, card sniping is the only racket I've ever known. - That's all there is to that. - Oh, you're so wrong. Maybe you don't realize it, but you've been making good at the brokerage office. Mr. Laidlaw told me. Checking up on me there too, eh? Well, you won't have to bother about that anymore. I fixed it up so you can stay on here at the apartment and... here's some money to take care of you. I don't know how long I'll be gone but I'll write you letters now and then. I guess it's all over then, eh? You are a nice kid Connie, you know how I feel about you but... Well, I just got to get away. Kid, you just played in tough luck. You should've met some nice business guy who wants to settle down. I've met the guy I want to settle down with. And what's more, I could even live in Glendale with him. And that's saying something. Oh, then I don't have to decide what to do. Of course you must decide. Well, anyway Jerry I... I want you to know that these few months have been the happiest in my life. Yes and you saved me from... Oh, I don't know what I've done if you hadn't come along. And always remember this, I believe in you. And someday you're going to settle down and have a couple of kids. Mind you, I'm not trying to talk you into anything. I know you need a lot of rope. Whether you hang yourself or bring the rope back, I don't know. It's up to you, but I'll be waiting for you. - What did you say? - I'll be waiting for you. Wait a minute. Now, let me get this straight. Are you trying to tell me I want to settle down? Have a couple of kids, is that it? Hey look, I've got an idea. I don't know how good it is but I'll take a gamble. What is it? Now you don't ask any questions. - Where's a match? - Here. I changed my mind about your staying here, you're going back to Glendale. But I like it here. I'm not going to leave you in this hard boiled town. You're going back to Glendale on the next train. - But Jerry... - Listen, I'm still running this family. Hello? I told you not to phone this hotel, I said I'd see you later. Come on, I'll help you pack. I thank you very much. You know, if I wasn't such a toughie, you'd get under my skin. You're not so tough. No? You don't think so, eh? Darling, keep this. Is this the one? - Listen, there won't be any letters. - No? No, I'll cable you. - Then you are going to South America? - Yes. - But don't you worry honey. - I won't worry. Aboard. Sweetie, I have to get off. - How much time have we? - About half a minute. Thank you. - Hey, hey skipper, that's no way to... - I'm not crying, I'm... We won't be away from each other darling, I'll be with you every minute. - Aboard. - Board. Honey, I'll only be gone three months. Goodbye darling. No more crying now, you understand? - What's keeping that bohunk? - I don't know. You mug, you want to give us heart failures? She's pulling out in five minutes. - I'm not going. - You're what? - Not going? - Say, what is this? Something big has come up and I got to stick around. - Well, then, I stick with you. - Oh, no, you don't, this is personal. - I'm not going without you. - Well, I'm going anyway. Yes, yes. I want you to go Vargas, you be doing me a big favor... and I need you down there. Now look, here are some cables, I want you to send them to my wife. I want her to think that I'm in South America and that they're coming from me. - You get it? - Yes. Send one each week to Glendale. Now here, the notes all here. Just be sure to send the right cable on the right date. - You understand? - Yeah. All right, thanks, I won't forget it. - Goodbye and good luck. - Goodbye Babe. - Goodbye Vane. - Bye bye. Goodbye. - Come on now, what's up? - Now listen pie face, I can't tell you yet. Just lay low till I get in touch with you. All right? Ok. - Hello Babe. - Hi Collins. What's on your mind? Say look... for six years you've been trying to pin a record on me, haven't you? - Yeah. - You've been working hard. Well, here's your chance. I'm going to give you a break. Well... I'm thinking of running out to Blackwell's Island for little while I'm kind of run down. Might build you up a tad. Cook up any charge you like and I'll plead guilty. - You following me? - I'm right behind you. I'll take a 90 day stretch in the workhouse and that's got to clean me up, see? Ninety days, your uncle, we can send you up for five years. Sure, if you could convict, but you can't and you know it. And then what? I do my bit, come out, and we're washed up. - You get me? - Yeah. But I don't get you. Come on, let's have it. What's back of all this? Just this, I don't want any more gumshoes trailing me. Things got to be different from now on. Oh, now I get you. She's a blonde, isn't she? Let's see the DA. And by the way, you can't put a black ten on a black Jack. - Time is up Kenton. - Goodbye little gal. - Say goodbye to Daddy. - Good bye Daddy, good bye Daddy. Goodbye, Daddy. - Hello you mug. - Hi pie face. - You get to Glendale? - Just got back. - Everything is ok. - Connie better? - Was only a cold. - She didn't get on you were there? No, I got all my news from that Palace Hotel phone operator. What's her name? Emma. I'm in swell with her, took her to the dance up at Lake Inspiration. Yeah, it's a great spot up there. Connie been getting my cables from South America? Good old Vargas, he's right on the dot. I saw the one that came through on Saturday, here's the copy. - You know the telephone operator too? - Sure, I took her to the movies. And I played a five cent limit poker with her brother Joel. - That paid for the trip. - Come on, read the cable. Leaving for New York next Wednesday. Can hardly wait, love Jerry. Yeah, that's right. I leave from Rio Wednesday and takes 21 days to get here. Yeah, that's right. Well Babe, there's only one thing more, I don't know if I should tell you. - What is it? - Nothing to worry about, only... Connie is coming to New York in two weeks. - Why? - I don't know. She sent a card to the hotel to open the apartment and... she's bringing her mother. Well sure, she's expecting me home. Now there's a girl for you, thinks of everything. Well, that's all right, then what else? Yeah, but it's not so right. - I ran into Kay again yesterday. - What about it? Yeah, you can say that all right, safe in prison. That Jane pops up out of my coffee every morning. Hey, you keep her away from there when Connie gets there. What will I do? Chloroform her? No, give her ether, last longer. I can't understand it. And you're sure there is no boat from Rio tomorrow? Thank you. Beats me. Man away for three months and doesn't even tell you what boat he's coming on. - Maybe is coming by plane. - Plane? Well, you brought it all on yourself. Letting him go away without leaving any address to reach him by. I know if I were a man, I'd want to know it if I was going to have a baby. It'll be a bigger surprise. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Stewart. Who? I don't seem recall your name. Yes. Come right up. Well, must I ask you? Who was it? A friend of Jerry's. Mother, mother would you mind leaving us alone? Goings on I don't know anything about. All right, don't tell me, I'm not asking you. Was it some woman? I'll bet it was. Popping in on people this way. - Mrs. Stewart? - Yes. I'm Kay Everly, I used to know your husband... back in the good old days of three months ago. - Come in, won't you? - Thanks. Yes, I remember, he had a photograph of you. - But it didn't really do you justice. - They never do. - What is it about Jerry? - Oh, nothing to worry about. I suppose I shouldn't drop in at a time like this. I guess you're all excited about him getting out tomorrow. Pardon? Well, you're expecting your husband tomorrow, aren't you? Yes, he's due from South America. Yeah, yeah, of course. - Could I have a drink? - Certainly. Yeah? Well, phone over there and see if I'm wrong. He's right across the river. Why didn't he send for you at a time like this? Why didn't he let you in on it? I'll tell you why, he's not that kind. Why, if he was ever square with himself, he'd take poison to get even. But that's just what I like about him. I don't care if he took a rap or 100 raps, I'm for him just as heavy. You're wasting your time Miss Everly. Happens I'm in love with my husband. What? After all this? Are you on the level? You know, blondes have more spunk than they're supposed to have. Ever noticed that? - He always was partial to blondes. - Yes. - Would you like another drink? - Thanks. Say, I'm oozing out of town tomorrow. Don't say anything to Babe about this, will you? - No. - If he asks about me... just tell him that I've gone cuckoo and I'm through with him. No, no. Don't do that. When I'm finished with a guy, I'm finished, he'll have to find that out. Well, good luck. Well, anyway the liquor was good. - Goodbye Mrs. Stewart. - Goodbye Miss Everly. Oh, don't bother, I know the way out. Well, why didn't you call me? What did she want? Oh darling, isn't it grand? It's just like I told you, he's coming by plane. He'll be in tomorrow. Be in New York, I guess. Other people knowing it before a man's own wife. - Why are you crying? - Can't a girl cry if she's happy? Say, what do they sell in South America? Shawls, dolls, Indian baskets... Panama hats, monkeys, love birds, coffee. What do you want? Well, it's got to have a South American label. Here. This pottery, Valparaiso, see it on the bottom? No Connie, no. Honestly, I haven't seen him in nearly three months. I tell you he's in South America. - Hasn't he cabled you or anything? - Yes. - Once a week punctually. - You see? Oh Charlie, let's stop kidding ourselves, I know Jerry hasn't been in South America. Was sent to Blackwell's Island for three months. And you know it as well as I do. All I want to know is why he was sent there and what happened. All right. Babe wasn't sent up, he walked in and handed himself up. Yes and on the very night he was supposed to sail. I got a kind of a hunch he's in love with you Connie. He wanted to get the mud off his shoes. - Well, when does he get out? - He's out. Well, where is he? Why isn't he home? Well, give him a chance. They only let him out this morning. - You sure? - Positive. Oh, that's all I wanted to know. Charlie Charlie, now be a good little boy and run away. Oh Charlie. Hello darling Mr.Vane, this is my mother. - How do you do? - How do you do? I was just out on my way over to Grant's Tomb, would you care to join me? Why, that would be lovely, but I'm expecting... Mother Mr.Vane means I'd like to see Jerry alone first. Well, I got the lilies and the roses but I still say hollyhocks would've been nicer. They have a sort of a home touch. - Don't you think so Mr.Vane? - Yes, I like roses. Now, let me look at you. - No darling, let me look at you. - There you go, starting argument right on. Come here, you. Well, tell me something. No, just let me look at you. - Well, tell me everything. - Well, let's see. Look, I picked this guy up in Rio, named him Glendale. Yeah and honey, lucky he didn't die on board. Oh, it's such a rough trip. Oh, no kidding. The third day out, the waves broke over the top deck. A great big ocean liner, would you believe it? Oh honey, it was a regular hurricane. And you should've seen the excitement on board. Why, they even had the passengers put on their life belts...
