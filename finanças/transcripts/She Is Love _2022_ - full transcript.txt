- I have this reoccurring dream where I'm cooking pasta. When it's ready, when the time comes to drain the water, I can't bring myself to let go of the water. I don't want to drain the water, I wanna keep all the water. It's just hot water, just hot, murky, pasta water. And I think it means I'm afraid of letting go of something I don't need anymore. I don't know why. - You have two new voice messages. - Hey, hon, hope the flight was okay, and the pills weren't too strong in the end. Let me know how the meeting goes. Erm, call me soon so I can tell you how badass you are. I promise, promise the weekend's gonna fly by, okay? Love you, Pat. - Next new message. - PS, all the hotels on your list were fully booked, but I managed to get you a room at a boutique hotel just outside of town. Hope it's okay. Love you, Pat. It's Taylor, by the way. - Hi, do you have a booking with us? - Yes. - First room on the right. - Are you kidding me? This room is ugly. - Hello, excuse me! I didn't hear anyone arrive. I'm sorry about that, I was loud, but I didn't see anyone come in. Hello! Hello. Is anyone in there? I'm sorry about the noise, I didn't know anyone was here. I'll leave you to it. - Can I help you? - You? - Hello. - Hello. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? Are you all right? Did you know I was here? I kind of live here. - You live here! Of all the places? I'm just staying in this hotel. - I can't believe it, the last I heard you were living in America. - Hello! Idris, Idris! Idris! - Hey, hi! - Guess what? - What? - I fucking did it! - I knew you would. - I'm a writer now! - Sh! - Oh, shit, sorry. - Come and tell me downstairs, tell me everything. - Okay. - Yeah. - Well, I mean, it was good, she literally got me to do a bit of like a dance and a bit of a thing. - Yeah. - And literally gave me the job there and then, because the thing that I couldn't be dealing with, is two weeks of like did I get it. - No. - Did I not get it? - No, no. - Hey, hey, you okay? And like, she told me there and then like, you know, you've fucking got the part. I mean, it's amazing. - Amazing, totally. - I literally couldn't have wished for anything better. Be excited for me, be happy for me. - Totally excited, this is amazing. - Yeah? - Yeah, of course I am. - It could've just gone on for ages or they could've been like- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, ssh! - What do you mean, shush? - No, no, I don't mean... I don't mean. I don't mean shit. - What are you thinking? - Not shush, shush, shush. - I'm so excited. - I know. - Are you not excited for me? - I'm so excited. - Oh, my God, you know where she saw me? The casting director? - No. - She saw me in that fucking gig in Manchester. - Yeah. - That terrible gig. - No, you're kidding. - Yeah, apparently, and she was just like, I remember seeing you that night and- - Great. - You were just like, electric and like, dynamic. The gig that you told me was like the first time, that you were like, oh, no, I actually like this girl. That's the gig that she came to see, so clearly I was like exuding amazing energy that night or something. And then it was cool, because that they actually had me do in the end with a guy. - A guy? - So they cast, they got the cast in so as to do it with me. But he was quite good actually. - Yeah. - You don't feel well? - No, I feel really good, I think I'm just... I think I'm just excited about everything you're telling me. - Oh, yeah, did anyone come? - Where? - What do you mean, where? Here. What have you been doing? - So you arrived there and then you were in a big room, there's a stage? - What? No. - It's just like a regular room? - It's like a rehearsal room. - It looks like a regular room. - Yeah, it was- - How many people were in there, like, there's three people in there? - Did the guests arrive? - I was tryna set up the decks. - Right, so you were doing your fucking thing, the one thing I asked you to do-- - No, the electricity went. - No. - Hear me out. - No, I get it, you were setting up the decks. I'll check the books. - No, no, the music was really loud. Louis, so this is-- - If anyone's here, it'll be in this book. - This is the thing and this is what you think. - What are you doing? I need to see if someone's here. - The thing is that this is what the thing is. - Oh, my... Someone is here, I told you before-- - I've got to tell you something. People... History, time. - What the... - Old time. - Oh, I'm sorry, two seconds, I've been meaning to... Hi. - Here's hoping, I am tired. - Sir, excuse me. - Louise, wait. I'm so lucky to have found you. No, are... You're just amazing. My ex-wife is upstairs. - What? - Yeah. There, that's her. - Wow! - Yeah. I thought you'd invited her but then I wondered why you would even do that, but then I realised that would be crazy. - That would be insane. - You wouldn't do that. - I would never, why? - So she's just here. - Because? - She's a guest, she happens to be a guest. - She happens to be a guest. - It's a coincidence. I haven't seen her for 10 years, I haven't spoken either. I haven't spoken to her. - Does she know you have a girlfriend? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I said-- - So it's not gonna be weird, she's not gonna be like, oh, who are you there? - She's not here to see me. - Well, no. - She's not come looking for me. - Right. - She's... - She's just here. - She's just here. - Was it awkward when, when you spoke to her? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, I can't really explain what it was like. It was... She's, she's an ex but I love you. - Right, did you tell- - I'm so happy you got that role, though, it's amazing, yeah. - You have two saved messages. - Hey, hon, hope the flight was okay and the pills weren't too strong in the end. Let me know how the meeting goes. - I, erm, feel a bit underdressed. - You look great. - You look great and I like the- - Well, I thought, you know- - You thought? - It's my 40th coming up. - All right, yeah. - I just... Well, I thought I'd make a bit of an effort for dinner. - For dinner? - For dinner. - For dinner. - Yeah. Hello. - Patricia, this is Louise. - Hi. - I've got on oatmealy hands, but hi. - It's okay, I'm, I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. I just thought, erm, since my phone isn't working, if you could, if I could borrow a phone just to call a taxi to get some dinner or- - Yeah, definitely. - There doesn't seem to be any self-service here, so- - I mean, absolutely, but I'm cooking dinner. - No, no, I don't wanna trouble you at all. - I'd like it if you'd stay, if you wanted to. - Yeah, why not? - I'm aware of how acutely uncomfortable the situation is. - Oh! - Not at all. - No, not at all. - No. - Listen, I'm glad you said something but it's fine. - It's just, it's just an incredible coincidence. - Yes, it's fine. Louise, it's fine, please, you can come in. I mean, only if you want to, if you wanna go out you can go out, but, I mean, I'm making enough bolognese for- - It smells delicious. - So please. We were supposed to have a nice couple of days and damn life happens and Idris' ex-wife, Patricia, comes to stay. They haven't seen each other in a long time, in like 10 years, so they need time to catch up, I guess. But in the time being, erm, it'll be all good. We'll have a lovely birthday and, erm, like my mum always said to me, resentment is the poison you drink while you're waiting for the other person to die. - So Louise, she's really lovely. - Yeah. - Seems like she's been a good influence, you're not drinking. - I feel great, I feel really good. - I can see that, you look good. - I need to stop, we're having fun, we're having a great time. - Now I'm gonna feel really bad when I get you to start drinking. - No, I couldn't imagine. So what d'you, what d'you do, what d'you do? - I travel and I make television. - You make television? - It's amazing, I love it. - I'm still playing, by the way, you didn't ask how I'm doing, but I'll tell you anyway. - You're playing? - Yeah. - That's good. - Still doing music. - Are you still writing songs about me? Might be. - So you're doing the same thing? I'm a bit disappointed. - Hi, how are you getting on with the menu? - Good, actually. - Could I have a look at what you've got? - Yeah, I mean, to be honest... I wanted to show you my notes. - Yeah. - Erm, and there's no fish on the menu, so I was thinking we could put some-- - Classic scampi and chip on the dinner there go, gets a lot of compliments. - I just feel like we should incorporate fish into the menu in... Well, if we switch out the Caesar salad for like a tuna swirl or something. - What about sort of kipper? - A kipper kip? - Okay, I can do kipper. - Boil a kipper. - Er, boil a kipper. Mm, what do I like just fresh fish but it's lemon salt- - Like a battered cod. That I can do. - See, that's sort of exactly the opposite of what I was saying. I said fit, I want something healthy, something nourishing my soul. My soul needs a little bit of love bit of nourishment and healthy energy. So I'm gonna say it's healthy fish, bit of salt, bit of lemon, bit of olive oil, done, fish. - I'm not sure. - Not sure. Okay, I'm gonna make it really easy then. I'm sure and I want sea bass. So what we're gonna have is sea bass, okay? - What is she doing? - It's a nice way to wake up actually, bang, bang, bang! - Stop it. Morning. - Morning, you're pissy, Idris. - Shut up. - Hi. - You're up already? - Yeah. - What are you doing? - What's it look like I'm doing? I'm thinking. - Can you think without the ball? - That's how I think. - Do you want to use another wall? You might break a window. - No, no, no, I hit the window, they're not breakable. - It's glass. - I'm coming down. - No, no, don't bother. - Hi. She blew me a kiss, she just blew me a fucking kiss. If she offers again to get a taxi and leave, you know the answer this time, yeah? - Oh, I'll take a nap. - Feeling a bit better to say? You're disgusting. - You're impossible. ♪ This is one is taking you on, this one is taking you ♪ ♪ do where you do where you wanna be ♪ ♪ This one is taking you on ♪ ♪ This is one is taking you on ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ - You're going, you're going.

Oh, God. - Look at you. - Yeah, it's stupid. I was putting them up, but then I kind of-- - What are you doing? - I brought it with me, Louise wanted to bring 'em, she thought it'd be funny to have decorations- - Let's keep it. - But actually looking at it, sort of a little bit embarrassing. - It's not. - Okay. - Idris Thomas, lover boy. - I think I'm just wanting to reminisce, I guess. - Uhuh! - I dunno what brought that on. What does it feel like being back in Komo? - Erm, it feels like... Have you ever gone into a house where there's been a murder? Not knowingly. - Okay, feels like coming home, and it feels like... Well, right now I feel like I'm at my funeral. - Did you see the house? - Yeah, I stopped by. - Me too. - Did you think it was gonna be there? - I dunno, I dunno what I was thinking. - It was weird. - Yeah, it's weird. - It's like it was frozen in time. - Yeah. - Wonder what lives are being ruined. - Inside, you mean? - Yeah. - I haven't checked for the key under the mat the last time I went. - I did too. - Did you? - Yeah, no key. If there was, I probably would've gone inside. - I know you would've done. - Such a weirdo. - Yeah. - I wanted to see what colours they painted the walls. I mean, it's not a good look. - What's not a good look? - I mean, me showing up here. - Well, it's not a bad look, it's just was surprising, is all of this. - Well, you were the last person I thought I would see, my God. - We're here now, aren't we? For some reason. - Yeah, for some God awful reason. - For some fucking God awful reason. - No, I mean, honestly, I spent many, many years thinking I would see you, and then I never did. It's really something because the first couple years that I didn't see you, it was as if you were just gonna show up when I turned a corner in London and New York. - Yeah, I have exactly the same thing. - In Africa. It could have been anywhere, could have been on a safari. I didn't come in to talk about the weather, Adam. I came here to talk about us. I didn't come in to talk about the weather, Adam. I didn't come in to talk about the weather, Adam. I came in to talk about... What do you think it is? I didn't come here to talk about the weather, Adam. I didn't come here to talk about the weather Adam, I came here to talk about us or I didn't come here to talk about the weather, Adam. No, that's weird. - Were those different? - Okay, so I didn't come here to talk about the weather, Adam, I came here to talk about us, that's it. 'Cause it's not weather, it's us. So I didn't come to talk about... I didn't come here to talk about the weather, Adam, I came in to talk about us. You do it, you do it. Do Adam, and then do weather. So he says, it's such a beautiful day today. It reminds me of that day in May back in 2016. - I say that. - No, you say my bit, yeah. - Sorry, I dunno if this is my sort of forte, I'm more book person. - I'll say it, you say my line 'cause I just don't need to hear my line. Oh, it's such a beautiful day today. So my line is, I didn't come here to talk about the weather, Adam, I came to talk about us. - I didn't come here to talk about the weather, Adam, I came to talk about us. Is that good? - I have no idea what I'm doing or why they gave me this, it's so hard. - Yeah. - Acting is like, this is hard. - Yeah, maybe the less you rehearse it, the better it will be, you know, just sort of- - Yeah, maybe. - What have you been doing? - I mean, working, working, working my butt off. - In New York? - Yeah, New York, I live in New York. - I know you live in New York. - How do you not know this? Don't you have like Instagram? I dunno. I don't know via me. You don't like, I dunno, intrude at all, you don't like... You're not curious and ask anybody when I'm doing? - Yeah, I've always been... Well, no, I've always been curious. What do you do when you travel? Sort of work, is it? - I travel for work, I discover talent. Yes, turns out I'm very good at discovering talent, writers, writers, writers. - I'm a writer. - Yeah, well, no, I mean novelists, and then I- - Is that what you're doing here? - Well, I turn their art into television. - How cool, TV! - Yeah. - Yeah. - So that's what you do, you travel around and you like developing? That's amazing, but that's great. - Yeah, and I meet writers. - Yeah. - And I get to crush their dreams. And that's really what I do. - Is that some sort of revenge or something, you think? - It's my greatest revenge. - Revenge, yeah, and what about your writing, don't you write anymore? - Oh, not really, I'm not really... I'm not any good at that, I'd rather discover talent. - You're not gonna believe this. - What? - This. When I was looking through this. You remember that? - That's gibberish. - It's got some beautiful- - Shit. I'm not a career novelist, d'you know? That was just a little... That was a game, that was a-- - A game? It wasn't a game, it was more than... It wasn't just a game. It wasn't a game. Well, it wasn't a game to me. - No, it wasn't a game, you know, It was kind of like, it was like, rehearsal for real life, and now, and now, we're living real life and you know, real... And it's reality. Get rid of that box. - But you had talent and you had passion for it. - You're holding on to the past, why d'you have that? I have an idea, we should have a bonfire tonight and burn that box, and burn that, that's garbage, burn it, just burn it. - Oh my God, this is a nightmare. Is it just me or do the words actually not sound like words anymore? Weather, weather, weather, weather, weather. Is that a word? - Sounds like the word weather. - Yeah, I just... It sounds, starting to sound like the robot, right? - I'm sort of tryna do the numbers, number crunching over here so I actually need to focus. - I didn't come in to talk about the weather, Adam, I came here to talk about us. I didn't come... Oh, my God, I have literally no idea what to do. Can you help? Will you read some lines in me? Even just running lines 'cause honestly, at this point I don't even know if I know any of them. Do you mind? - I've got quite a lot brains of it. - Okay, understood. It's just... Yeah okay, fine. - Maybe you should take this sort of to another room and I could do the books in here and then you can have proper- - Maybe, but I've tried that. I spent all of last night doing this like, on my own and it's really, yeah. - Go on, go on. - Oh, thank you, thanks so much. I wouldn't normally ask, I completely understand it's not your job. - Is your uncle coming back soon? - In like, I think in like two days or something. - Okay, okay. - Just 'cause there's been quite a lot of screaming. - It's a nightmare situation for everyone involved. Yeah, it's not easy for me either, so it's just, you know... I mean, you know who. You know, it's Idris' ex-wife. - Oh. - And she... I dunno, I think she saw him and sort of went into a bit of a tail spin or something. - Get it away, get it away, get away. I can't, I can't deal with this, just like- - But this was good, this is what you wanted to do. - No, it's not, it's not, it's not good. - It was what wanted to be, you're gonna be writer. I was gonna be a song writer. - That is... Listen, why didn't you tell me your dad died? I'm sorry about Danny. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it's okay. I loved Danny. - I'm sorry. - Danny was like my dad too and I deserved a call, and I just had to say that. - I'm sorry, I should have called you. - Yeah, because Danny couldn't called me. - Patricia, oh, gimme some of that. - Fucking up. - Did you just drink that? - Yeah. - That's not water. - Oh, no, it's not water. Okay. Oh, boy. - Missed the thing they had for him as well. - Well, you know, you have to do what you had to do. - Yeah, but I'm never around in the right place when I'm meant to be, I'm never in the... Always in the wrong place. - That's truthful. We're so alike. - Thank you for dealing with all that. I never said anything. He would've been so happy that you were there. - He loved me, all right? He loved me, isn't he? - He loved you, yeah. We all loved you. I started playing this this morning. I think you've inspired, inspired me.
