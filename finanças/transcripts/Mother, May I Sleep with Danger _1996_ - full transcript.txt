(giggling) what? you're laughing. no. no, it's just... sometimes you get so serious. i am serious. i mean... you're so close to the perfect woman. i'll never be perfect. have you ever thought how you'd look as a blonde? (chuckles) you would be spectacular. i think you're trying to turn me into something that i'm not. sexy, beautiful, hot... so incredibly hot. my mom would have a conniption. your mother's jealous. she's always going to try to keep you down. shut up. my mom does not want to keep me down. you want me to prove it? yeah, mom. um, kevin and i want to come for a visit this weekend. yeah. ok, great. what? no. mom, you don't have to worry about the cooking. ok. oh. and, mom? i'm going to have a surprise for you. ok.

(chuckles softly) kevin's right. what's the point of studying languages when people are incapable of real communication? honey, this doesn't sound like you at all. yeah, well, it is me. i guess you better get used to it. (sea gulls calling) hey, ben. jessica, what are you doing here? jessica: i know you. if you're not with your patients, you're on your boat. ha ha! hi. is something wrong? i hope not. it's just... it's probably nothing but i need some information. how can i help? well, you're still with care share, right? yes. why? well, laurel's been seeing a young man, and the relationship troubles me. i wanted to find out more about him. and how does care share fit in? his father was on the board. you mean ivan kinsolver? no, the family name is shane. as far as i know, there's never been a shane on the board. well, not anymore. he died in a skiing accident last year. well, it couldn't be care share. there hasn't been a board vacancy in three years. it's a gold card. mm-hmm, yeah. shane. that is the name as it appears on the card: "kevin shane." my mother's maiden name... (coughs) uh, yeah, vickery. as in "vickery dickory dock." (laughs) well, lost, stolen-- i really don't know. is there some way that we can...? well, if you can pull it up on the computer, then we can go over the last charge records. yeah, that might help. yeah. thursday in whistler. no. yeah, no, that was me. i've been on the road. ok... friday in vancouver. no, that's me again. so what is the last charge record that you show? reservation guarantee-- in seattle? where? the motor inn tomorrow.

(water running) so you know, where did she end up? i mean, weren't you trying to get into her shorts or something? i was just a kid. so what happened? did she show up? i just told you, i don't know. all right. hey, billy, you want to throw me some shampoo? it's in my shaving kit. billy, come on. today. (clank) (indistinct chatter) those gals put some locker rooms to shame, mom. go, girls. yeah! (chuckles) help? mm-hmm. (chuckling) voila. (chuckling) oh. i miss kevin. honey, i wasn't going to say anything, but we need to talk about kevin. what about kevin? i mean... who is he? what do you really know about him? what's to know? he's the boy i love and want to be with. honey, there are just some things that don't add up... things that kevin told me about himself and his family. ok, so he's a little insecure, and he tends to embellish. i'm not talking about embellishment. look, i think he's doing amazingly well considering his whole family was wiped out. this is about his family. i saw dr. zola today, and he told me something about it. you've been snooping, right? laurel, please... no, you know what? you seem to forget that we had a bargain here, and, look, you're still trying to run my life. 79, 80! all right! ooh, happy birthday. happy birthday. happy birthday, grandma. yay! (whistling) (telephone ringing) woman: your lungs are still working! hello? i miss you, baby. i miss you, too. please come home. i'm so miserable when you're away. as soon as i can get out of here. i got a surprise for you when you get back. (chuckles) my mother's driving me crazy. and, kevin, i love you. i love you, too. i love you, kevin shane. do you like it? (giggling): it's wonderful. and you don't have to worry about any neighbors peeking in your windows! oh, it's a fantasy. is it expensive? i cut a deal with these people. ahh. it's perfect. and--and there's trails everywhere. you can run, you can study in peace... oh... it is awfully far out. that's the whole point. it's out of the campus scene. huh? what? what is it, too small? you don't like the color? i mean, tell me. i'll paint it, i'll fix it. i'll--i'll drywall it. no, i just... i kind of feel like you're pushing. oh...oh... it's not up to your high standards. is that it? you know, nothing i ever do is good enough for you. why, no... i love everything that you do. look, i'm just now getting a sense of who i am. it just feels so impulsive. i know, i know... i should... i should be a little more hang-loose, but if i were to hold back the way i feel about you then i would... i would explode. you don't want me to go climb a tower with a gun or... do you? no. ha ha! i wouldn't want you to do that. you can go home any time you want. i'm just too cautious. no, you're not. i mean, it's fine. we got...we got so much time. we got all the time in the world. woman: the number you have reached is not in service. please check the number and try again. (hangs up) (dialing) (line connecting) the number you have reached is not in service... (hangs up) hey. how's it going? i got done early. i wanted everything to be done before you got here. oh, well, could i help with any..? no! um, heh heh. open the wine. relax. ok. oh, the food looks great. have you been cooking long? no, about an hour. oh, hey, did the phone guy show up today? oh, yeah... still something screwy with the wiring. it's going to be a couple more days. a couple more days? you know, i really don't like being out this far without a phone. ow! damn it! (bird cawing) (bell ringing) (indistinct conversations) kevin. kevin. mrs. lewisohn. what's happening with my daughter? where is she? if i see her... don't give me that nonsense. you know perfectly well where she is. whatever your relationship with laurel is i don't want any part of that. i don't believe you, kevin. i don't believe anything about you. laurel listens to me now. i don't know what your game is, but i'm going to make sure that laurel knows you're a liar. laurel and i are in love. both of us would rather die than let you come between that love. laurel: you know, i told my mom how you love to cook, and--hee hee-- and i thought maybe next time she comes up, you could do something special. 'cause i know if, you know, the two of you got to know each other... (owl hoots) you hardly touched your food. uh...i'm not that hungry. are you sure? yeah. why? no. no, nothing, nothing. what? what's going on? i don't want to stir things up. what are you talking about? your mom called me the other day. my mother? why? what about? to talk about you. i can't believe this. she... she said that you had an eating disorder. she told you? well, she told me that... she told me that it was an emotional problem and that you had to be put in the hospital. how could she do this? hey, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i had to tell you. no. i understand. she is completely against us. your mother... is set on ruining our relationship. hey, where are you going? i am going to go call her and tell her to go to... no, no, no, no... what? no! that's what she wants. she wants to make trouble. this isn't about your mother. this is about you and me-- you and me. i mean, we got to start our own life. this is our home. you don't have to leave. nobody is ever going to run your life again... ever. (plates, bowls slide across table) well, we had a lit class at 2:00. so i waited around for, like, over a half an hour but she never showed. i don't understand any of this. mazie, who is this kevin shane? i don't know... i mean, i know he comes from the denver area. pretty much keeps to himself. i can't even say i've ever seen him with any friends or anything. what'd they say at the dean's office? nothing. no laws have been broken, so privacy laws prevent them from giving me any information. do you think i'm crazy? am i jumping to wild conclusions? of course not. look, i just don't know what set her off. you know, monday, i get back to the dorm and her stuff had been totally cleared out. nothing, no forwarding address? nothing. i even tried phoning his apartment but there was no answer. (engine sputtering) i don't believe this. laurel: i had to walk two miles to get to that pay phone. i couldn't reach mazie, nobody... and if i miss another lab peterson is going to axe me for sure. jackson: listen, you got to get out. you got to have some laughs. friday night, rymes with orange is playing at the coyote if you're interested. thanks, but... not like a date or anything-- just a friend thing. i can't. why? oh, 'cause of kevin. man, that guy practically owns you. you used to laugh and have such a good time. yes. hi. this is laurel lewisohn. ok. i finally got someone at the phone company. i don't know why they can't put a phone there. they can put a phone anywhere. yes, yes, i'm still here. no order? did you look up my name as well? yes... thank you very much. there was never a phone order. he never put in for a phone order. he lied to me. jackson, i just... i know that he messed with my car. all he wants to do is keep me a prisoner. this way. thank you so much for this. my son will be very grateful. mm-hmm. he's sure he left it behind when he moved. uh-huh. i'll be upstairs. call me when you're done.
