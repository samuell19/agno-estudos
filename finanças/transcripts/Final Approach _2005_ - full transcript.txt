JUNIOR PILOT This is Cuzco. Come in Flight 666. - He' crossing "El Paso de Muerte". - God help them all. - Who's the poor pilot? - Capitan Ricardo Bernardo. Ricardo Bernardo. If anyone can pull through it's Bernardo. He knows the Andes like the back of his hands. Desgracia! Stall! Stall! Pull up! Pull up! Terrain! Pull up! Pull up! Terrain! Pull up! Pull up! Terrain! You're not dressed? Good morning, dad. You got your job back? No. You gotta be looking the collect unemployment - "As real as it gets", eh? - It's fab! The four's got 3-D and Air Traffic Control's really cool now. By the time you've grown up... planes won't have pilots. Everything automated. - So, you're already packed, uh? - Since last week. - What do you want to see the most? - The Smithsonian, of course. The Wright Brother's plane, the Apollo, the Spirit of St. Louis... Look, I gotta go. You get dressed. Breakfast is getting cold. What's buzzing, cousin? You're late. Well, if it isn't Mr. Burn-Nerd himself. And his Nerdette. I'll get you in the minute you walk out the school. You're dead meat. Please. As you've all heard by now... because of the budget crisis... all the arts programs in public schools... are to be canceled. That means... I won't be with you after the break. But, I do hope we keep in touch. Yes, kids. The budget situation is serious. Even the football have to cut back a little. But I do have some good news about the trip. Our own, Richard Bernard... has composed a brilliant piece and you all will play at the White House. Mr. Smith is confident, given Richard's genius... that this will inspire the President... to restore the arts program. Maestro, please. Richard. Bernard. Mr. Bernard? Do me the courtesy to let me finish, before you ask any quastions. As I was saying... it's clear we don't have the money this year for the class trip. However, thanks to a donation of ten air tickets... from the LA Symphony... 10 of you will go. We'll meet up with the other schools in Washington. Now, Mr. Bernard... what was so important that you needed to interrupt me? Smith... "Smithsonien", sir. I thought, coach, sir, tha it might misspelled, sir. No biggie. Thank you, Mr. Bernard. Me and my big mouth. No, you're just being Spacey Casey again. And congratulations to our nine Cougars. What did he do now? He's not a bad kid, you know that. I know, this wasn't exactly... Excuse me. He gets in trouble because his head's in the clouds. He can't stop daydreaming. I'm sure you people have... some fancy initials for it nowadays a disorder, but... - This wasn't exactly his fault. - What do you mean "not exactly"? Coach Davis doesn't care, he's just unfair. Right now, Bruno's looking real unfair. Hey, chicken, what's clicking? We'll miss you, Ricky. I'm sorry. Come on, let's go this way. Just come on. No, not "Choke" Davis again. That's what we call him. That's what we call him. He cost us the championship... missed five foul shots in a row. Look, just because my son can spell and he can't. If this is about the plain tickets, I can still get it for about 10%... from my job, my old job. Really? Well, then you can both come. Dad! What are you doing? - You're here, dad! - You're going. To Washington. And so am I. - I've just appointed a chaperone. - Really? Really. On one condition. So we have a deal, right? Dad, I'm not a kid anymore, those daydreams were kid stuff. If you start to feel one coming on "snap out of it". I know it sounds silly, but that's how I quit smoking. - Well, I cut it way down. - No, you didn't! I'm going to. The point is no more tall tales, all right? I just don't want you to get hit by a car... or get in trouble the way you do, some times, OK? We have to live in the real world, Richard. Yes, Dad. Anyway, here's our exit, so... Go ahead. Please, put your shoes here. Security brake! - What have we got here? - It's just his allowance. Allowance, uh? Isn't that fun? OK, let's get your money. - Excuse me, did you take his quarter? - No, no. Thanks. Thank you. Gate 28, this way, let's go. I'm hungry and already had dinner. Excuse me. That's not Gate 28. Come on. Concern mounted for Ann Dorchester... granddaughter of billionaire Dudley Dorchester. She's been missing from the family state since Friday. The case took on a new twist... because the noted art collector has also reported... a priceless Incan gold mask missing. Speculation over whether this is a runaway or a kidnapping intensified... has intensified with news of the missing art treasure. Mr. Dorchester has the foremost collection... of pre-Colombian art in the US... most, housed in Washington DC. Wow, that's something. Very interesting. Attention, the Department of Homeland Security advises... that we are now at Code Orange. Your country depends on you to be vigilant. We're on Technicolor alert. Where are you going? Some bad stuff's going down, Lieutenant. I feel it. Hey, watch where you're going. He's very sick. - Sorry. - It's OK, don't worry about it. - What happened? - A heart transplant case... overwork stressed out the business man. But there's a compatible heart at John Hopkins. We only hope he'll stay alive for the next few hours. Nurse, we have to go. Sorry, kid. "Snap out of it." - Shashi, we can't take this plane. - What do you mean, jelly-bean? See that man? The real ugly one. Who? Him? He's not that bugly ugly. He's got a gun, a pistol. Right here. Hey, I want no part on your stories, you hear me? I've learned my lesson. Not another word on this. Not one. Fine. How's a passenger going to get through security with a gun? That's it! A maintenance mas brings it in. And gives it to him after going through security. Look there. No, you're not getting me this time, Ricky, no. All right, let's go, the Smithsonian's waiting. Come on! The big trip is here. - I'm going to the bathroom. - I'm not waiting for you. - I'll catch up with you. - No, you won't. Come on. That way, Sir. Good evening. There you go. Go ahead. Hi, how are you? Give me that. You're not allowed two pieces of carry-on luggage. I'll stay with this up front. Got a handful here. Come on, guys. There you go. Good. OK. Is this going to be the flight from hell or what? Don't worry, it's past their bedtime. They'll sleep the whole way. What are you doing here, Bernard? You're not supposed to be here. But you are a trombone short... Are you questioning my intelligence? Yes, sir. No, sir, I mean, no, sir. We wouldn't wanna question his intelligence. Keep going. I thought this was a simple budget matter, the things about the tickets. - Well, not entirely. - Not entirely for you. Look... you and I know about disappointments in school... and I wouldn't want him to let the team down, you know what I mean, Choke? Sorry, Coach. Find someone else's kid to pick on. What a loser. - That's my seat. - No, it's not. It's mine. Someone's gonna get hurt. Actually guys, that's my seat. Great, plenty of seats, you guys can sleep. No wonder the company's going broke. Go ahead, grab any one you want. Oh, boy! - I wish I was in the first class. - Me too. I mean in the hips, not the... Did you see how he looked around, checking everyone out? - Do you wanna a pillow? - No, thanks. Can we go visit de cockpit? I mean, later? I'm sorry, we can't do that anymore. Security. - He's seen plenty of them with me. - So, you're a pilot? - No messing around. - On vacation, are you? Right, on vacation in Washington. - Not in the air, dad. - The cockpit? The instruments, it's all the same as your computer program, exactly. Yeah, but, it's still not the same as flying for real. Bravo, we have three aircrafts at position 1-3-0. Mark position 1-2-0-1-2, altimeter in 2-9-9-1. Register 3-N-I-2-2. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Noonan. We're at the head of the queue now, on our way to Washington DC. Flying is 65 times safer than driving... according to Michigan Transportation Research Institute. What are you saying? That we're lucky to make it to the aiport... in the car? Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached our cruising altitude. The ride is smooth, so I'll turn off... the seat belt sign. As always though... we ask that whenever you're in your seat... you keep it buckled down. Since most of us... since you'll be sleeping... we won't speak to you again until just before our arrival in Washington. Good night. Have a nice rest. Man, they better serve supper soon. - We should do something. - Get real, Ricky. - Our lives could depend on it. - I don't wanna hear about it. Your daydreams always get us into trouble. - Hi, Ricky. - Hi, Mary Jo. Shashi. This is great, you made it. Did you know our coach's nickname in highschool... - was "Choke"? - I knew that already. Neat. Let's party, come on. Hey, Small. My hero! Let's move. It's night, we can't see out anyway. Let's get more room. Are you all right? Yes. I hate these things. You're afraid of flying? But you put these things together. I can keep them flying, I just wish they'd never been invented. It's not funny. I guess it's a little funny. Don't worry, I'll be right next to you the whole time. Tha front is moving a lot faster than they forecast. Must be the one that's beating through Texas. See those pictures on news? - Can we get above it? - I don't know. Call dispatch, get an update. You got it. - He hasn't made a move yet. - I'm starving. Shashi, all I'm asking is that you take a look. You see that bulge in the jacket? - It has to be the gun. - I hope they have a choice. Maybe fish. What's this about a gun, nerdboy? Nothing. Hey, nerdette, what's this about a gun? Ricky says he saw a man, like a passenger, with a gun. It was nothing, I was just kidding him. A gun? Come on, that's important. - Tell me. - Ricky says that he saw... a man with a pistol. But, of course, he was just kidding. I gotta go to the toilet. The sweaty guy with the handkerchief? Yeah. This is very serious, Ricky. We're in the same boat, same plane that is. Where did he have it? Yeah, I see the bulge. You saw it for real. Yeah, I did. You could be a hero, Ricky. Save the plane. Come on, pal, we better check this out, show me. No, I'm not going anywhere with you. That guy has a gun back there. Just show me. Come on. Go, go. You walk by, fall on him and trip for the gun, OK? - No way. Why don't you do it? - What can he do to you? Shoot me. OK, just walk and look and see if you can see it inside his jacket. You're going to the toilet and walking by, that's all. Go. Sorry, sorry, sir. Well, watch where you're going. Sorry, turbulence. Toilet... yes, in front. I saw it, I saw it, I did. I sure felt it this time. It's real reality, all right? What do we do? - I'm not sure. - We gotta tell somebody. - Like a grown up. - Who? No one will believe us. Yeah, we're just crazy kids, but we're safe, no? - The pilot has a gun, right? - I don't know. He's locked in the cockpit. The guy can't get in. If we die, I don't wanna look back and wish we'd done something. How do we put him out of action? Game is up, Kato. How did you find me? That's a National Security matter... I'm not authorized to discuss with scum like you. Only a scum with the highest security clearence. Give me your hot sauce case. - You hate spicy. - Just... - Chicken or pasta? - Pasta, please. Keep your trays down, thank you. Here you go. Be careful with that one... if you're not used to it. It's got a delayed kick. We'll both have the pasta, please. This is my job. It looks good. It might be my last meal. Hot, hot. Go ahead, you can eat. What is he doing? Stop it, Luke, eat your food. Use your words, honey. Do you want to throw up? This is mild stuff. If you'd used this, it would've killed him. Good we moved. - Potty, go potty. - OK, baby, here we go. Trial run a success. We need the strongest to take out the Big Monster. - Which is it? - Well... with this... you run the risk of being accused of murder. - It's self-defense. - Like a preemptive strike? Right, but, how do we get it into his food? Quick, the food cart's close to him. Come on. You said we had to do something. Come here. If we do them all, he'll get one. We can't kill innocent people. Though, sometimes, you have to sacrifice a few to save the many. - Chicken or pasta? - Pasta. Give me pasta. Lost the top to my... soda bottle. Actually, my contact lens. Here it is. - Did you do any? - No, all I had was chicken. But he took pasta, what do we do? I don't know. The concept was good. The execution was lacking. Come on, like we're going to the bathroom. You want something to drink? - Stewardess, do you have any hot sauce? - I'm sorry, not in economy class. The sauce is rather spicy though, and you have pepper. He likes hot food. Not good. Call that spicy? Thanks. Food war! There's a food fight backe here. We need help. Did she just say food fight? That's what it sounds like. You better go check that. Stop right there, you little miscreants. But, sir, we were in the toilet. We just wanna get out the line of fire and go back to sleep. Quiet! What's wrong? Someone had to complain about the airplane food. Back to your seats, please. I'll call Stickler, see if he wants the attendants up here. Right, the rules, can't be alone. Stickler, Hannah's coming back, we need to in the cockpit. That won't be necessary, sir. I have everything under control. So much for the food fight. We're gonna hit that front any moment. - Where's my food? - She must have taken it. You stole my food! Serves you right. - I'll kill you! - Get me? You stole my food. Focus, OK? We've got lives to save. Whether they deserve being saved or not. Not now, Shashi. You know what happens when I don't eat. Come on, heroes don't get hiccups. Focus! I managed to find the hot sauce, sir. Hot. I'm sorry, did you burn your tongue? These microwaves are very uneven. - Spicy. - Spicy? Spicy! Men. All talk. - Say he didn't see us. - He didn't see us. - Say it and mean it. - He saw us. He's coming. And he pointed at me. - And he reached in here. - For his gun? Yeah. I think that did it! No more... Hide, we gotta hide, quick. Closed. In that one. - Get out, I was here. - It's an emergency. I have an emergency. I gotta go bad. - Well, go. - I can't with you guys here. Oh, no, gotta go, gotta go! Close the door, man! Ladies and gentlemen, we could be running into a bit of turbulence. So, please, return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. - Coming or going? - Shove off, buster! In or out? Come on! Get out! I'm gonna break your necks! Stay there! God! You can't sleep either, uh? - I wanna play too. - Jesus, you scared me! - No, go back. - No. Tell me the game. - Where's Shashi? - Listen: There's a hijacker with a gun. We're onto him and he wants to kill us. That sounds fun. No! Go back! It's that way. This is exciting! We're being bad. Get in there, go. - Did you see them coming here? - No. They must be back in economy. - I think they're here. - Don't want you shooting them here. You'll awake the first class passengers. Economy, that's different. Let's look there, if we don't find them... we'll search here. Did I hear right? Shooting? No. They were just joking. Let's go. - What was that? - What? Stay there. - What? - Stay there. Is there a doctor on board? We have a medical emergency. Please, present yourself in the first class. Dr. R. Bernard here. I don't know if I can be of help. I'm only a heart surgeon. Not "The" Dr. Bernardi of General Memorial? Yes. I'm just back from Hawaii, first vacation in 10 years. Thank God, Dr. He's a heart patient. Dr. Bruno, here, did his best, but he's only a... small animal veterinarian. I thought you said you were a large animal vet. I fibbed. Our only chance to save this man's life is to operate immediatly. - Do you have a medical kit? - Yes, Dr., but... security's removed any sharp instruments... - like scalpels. - Do you have any cutlery? - Plastic. - That'll have to do. Two knives, one fork and a spoon. Wait, better make that three spoons. Right away, Dr. - Dr, can you save my father? - I can't be sure, young missy... until I've opened up this sucker. So, let's get cut. - That was close. What do we do? - We could hide in the toilet. Been there, done that. They'll look there first. - Overhead racks? - We're too heavy. They must be in first, like I thought. We're almost there now, let me check to see where they are. Be careful. They're coming. Follow me. - What's this? - A safe place. How do you know all this? My dad's taken me to maintenance a million times... and shown me all over. - Spooky. - He's back in first class. - Did he see you? - No. You sure? No. We better hide. Quick. Look at his neck, it's tangled up in that chain. Don't! Come here, come here. Easy. It's OK. It's OK, it's OK. Come on, hurry, let's go. Come on. We can make like a little house, be totally hidden. Right. Here's a good one that can cover us like a door. I know you're down here and you're in big trouble. - It sounds a lot like Bruno. - That idiot. That's all we need now. Help me! Help me! Thanks, guys. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Transglobal 40, this is Washington Center. Descend at pilot's discretion to maintain 5.000 feet. Dulles altimeter: 2-9-3-7. Pilot's discretion to 5.000, leaving 3-3-0 now. You hear that? We're starting our descent. We're gonna make it. Only a few minutes more. Where are we? We're almost there, we're heading down. By the way, wasn't Ricky sitting over there? They probably found some place to lie down. Good boy. He's coming. Just be still. You sure? Darn, I was stupid! We're trapped here. We're well hidden. - I hope. - We're landing soon. That can be the most dangerous time. Stay here. Stop it! It's the Incan mask. The stolen mask. He wasn't a hijacker. He's a kidnapper. What? I don't understand. Didn't you hear about that girl who was missing? Well, there's a gold Incan mask missing too. - That's it, I tell you. - Is there a reward, do you think? Did he put it back in the suitcase? No, I'm pretty sure he put in one of those black computer bags. Why? Why did he... Of course! If he had it in his handluggage it would've been seen by x-ray. But leaving the plane, nobody checks you. And maybe there're others. And he's double crossing them. There's that flight attendant who's in on it. We have to tell someone. Right. This is different now. I have the cell phone my parents gave me for the trip. Yeah, like call 911, right? No, that's not a bad idea. Kato's not getting off the plane until we land, that's for sure. If we warn the pollice, they can be at the gate... and check everyone leaving the plane. We can tell them about Kato. Reward time! Come on, it's not over yet. Go ahead and call them, Mary Jo. First I have to see if it works. - 911. - Hello. I want to report a kidnapping, attempted murder... and the theft of the Incan gold mask, the one that's been on the news. - What's your name? - Mary Jo. - Where are you, Mary Jo? - Right now? Yes, right now. I'm in the baggage compartment of an airplane. Really? That's nice. We're about to land in Washington. We're going for a concert there. - Mary Jo, how old are you? - 10, almost 11. Is there an adult there you can put on? Are you the child's father? Brother, ma'am. And how old are you? 21... Crazy kids. OK. No one is goinna believe kids. It's a fact of life. But, we saw the mask, we know the guy has a gun. No more deffense, we're going on offense. It's going to get tough below ten. Call Stickler. Make sure everyone's down. - No one. - What do we do now? We start looking. What are you doing up here? You were supposed to be on your seats. The capitain's given orders to buckle up. Sit, buckle up. This is so against the rules. Your parents are gonna hear... Never mind. Shashi, you go back to economy. See if Kato is back there. Go to my father and tell him about the mask. - Nothing about the gun. - Why don't you go tell him? Believe, he won't believe me. Why should I believe you if he won't? Believe me, just because he won't believe me... doesn't mean you shouldn't believe me. You saw it. Mary Jo is more convincing. She gets straight A's. Just do it. I'll check here. If it wasn't him, the person's probably in the first class. - Could be business? - Could be. You go check out there. A black shoulder bag. I'll go help Shashi. Two is more convincing than one. - Friends? - Friends. Mask? You were in the baggage compartment? Why? Ricky said we couldn't tell you that part. He's telling the truth, Mr. Bernard. - Where's he? - First class. First class? I think I'll go there. I'm gonna be late for class. Get down. Doctor, wake up, help me. Another injection. No. You're gonna be OK. It's all gonna be OK. I lost it. Fill it up. Fill it up. Why is this moving? Let go, let go, honey. Help me, Doctor. This is Ann Dorchester. These are kidnappers. - We've gotta stop them. - This child's crazy. This patient is very, very sick. - She shot a dog! - He's crazy. - Get up here, we have a problem. - Everybody calm down. The kid is having a panic attack. All this rough flying. I'm not having a panic attack. It's true, I'm not. You better go. - You want the Beauty or the Beast? - Send Midge. Let go. You again! Get back to your seat! I tell you, this is Ann Dorchester. On behalf of the airline, I wish to apologize. I hope this won't prejudice you from flying with us again. As you can see, we can't predict crazies. Doctor, she has the mask. She came down to the baggage and took it and put it in a black bag. He's crazy. They told you was an old man, remember? I tell you, this is Ann Dorchester. What are you doing? Ricky, let go, let go! They're kidnappers. Captain Noonan's up front alone. What exactly is going on here? What's happening? Are we on a plane? Put the gurney back. Get the shot, get the shot! Why don't you give me the gun and we can talk things over? I don't think so. Short-circuit. - Engine room. - It's still locked. Stand by. Everybody stay back. Stay back. And don't move. Access denied. Stand back. You too. Good job. Easy. You all right? She's OK. Transglobal 40, Washington Center. Do you read on 1-3-3-5? They're on a vector headed right into the restricted no fly area. No answer from the cockpit. Stop, in the name of the law. He's with them! He's got a gun! God's sake! I'm an Air Marshal. I'm a Federal Air Marshal. Let him go. - Let me go, I can't breathe. - Cuff him. Get up. Let me go. This is not fair. So, this is Ann Dorchester? And I'm sure you'll find the Incan mask in this bag. You betrayal me. - No. The mask was mine. - Quiet! Quiet! I don't know whether to arrest you or give you a medal. Maybe both. Good job. Crazy boy. Well, all's well that ends well. We should let Mr. Dorchester know that his daughter is all right. Capitain? Capitain? He's not in Camp David, he's in Air Force One. F- 16, permission to take off. Everyone back to your seats. We'll be landing in a few minutes. Yes, please. Everyone take your seats. Where's First Officer Reitsch? Hannah, we have a problem up front. - My God! What happened? - She's at cold. The cocckpit door's locked, the captain is not answering. - Thank God, you're a pilot. - I'm not a pilot, I'm a mechanic. - But you said you were. - I wish I was. Well, Noonan better be all right. Do you know how to get into the cockpit? I know all about the new security doors. Let's go. You stay with the passengers and keep them calm. - And you stay calm. - You stay here, son. - You'll just get in the way. - But, dad... This isn't a game or a daydream. No, general, we can't raise them either. I see your two planes, they're closing fast. It'll be close. Yes, I'll try them again. Transglobal 40, this's Dulles. I'm at 215, do you read? - What if I shoot here? - The door is bullet proof... and the ricochet might hit some eletronics or us. Thank God, she knows the code. I'm not pretty sure with so many flights. She's pretty sure. Go ahead. I don't know if it's another 4, or 5 or 6. Look, now, you got 3 chances. Then the system locks down for good. Go ahead, it's gotta be one of those three. Access denied. Don't panic. I doesn't have to be in a row... - There's an F-16 out there. - Oh my God! OK. Try 7-4-4 again and this time, 5. Thank you, sir. He says it's our call. From here, it looks like there's no one in the cockpit. That's what it looks like, sir. What are you waiting for? It's gotta be 5 ou 6. I hit the wrong key when we hit turbulence. Is it 5 or 6? There's only one left? - Dad! - Not now, Ricky. Take your frineds back to their seats and buckle up. Tight! Fast, come on. There are two F-16's out there. Come on. What's this? It releases the smoke out of the cockpit in case of fire. Do you have anything to open it up? Come on, hurry. Thanks. Perfect. - No, no, not 5. - Well? Six. - You sure? - No. He who hesitates is lost. Thank God. Short-circuit. Check fuses. Fuses are in the cockpit! Let my climb on your back. Watch out. Do it again. Come on! Arm missile. Missile armed. Target locked. 25, 24, 23... You've reached the FAA hot line. If you know your party's extension... 16, 15, 14... Gotta be kidding. 10, 9, 8... They're out of the populated area They're gonna crash. Thank God! Thank God? There're passengers on that plane, for Pete's sake! Abort! Missile disarmed. Assume the emergency landing position. You can find information on the card. We're landing at 500 miles per hour. Hello? And good bye! Pull up! Pull up! Terrain! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Terrain! Your daydreams always get us into trouble. Ricardo Bernardo. If anyone can pull through it's Bernardo. - Pull up! Pull up! - What are you doing, Bernard? - You're not supposed to be here. - Watch where you're going. On one condition: - This is not a daydream... - My hero! Pull up, you idiot! Stall! Stall! Stall! Stall! Stall! They're pulling up. What? No crash? You feeling that? Captain, captain. Capitain Noonan? - Open the door. - I'm busy, I can't know. - Did you hear something? - It sounded like... Ricky! Ricky. Ricky, open the door, let us in. Richard, open the door now, please! What do you see, Major? I see... a kid, sir. And there's someone at the window waving. It's a little girl, sir. He's losing it. He's seen too many X- Files. - Are you sure, Major? - Yes, that's a confirm. - Are they midgets? - They don't look it, sir. Could be pygmies. Pygmies? We had pygmy prowlers around our bivouac in Africa, but flying a 777? Pygmy prowlers, sir? I read an intelligence report on that, sir. - CIA? - Us. Office of Special Plans. Department Defense. My God! She's holding up a cell phone. Contact. Right. Get on the cockpit radio. Open the door, let us in. Transglobal 40. Come in. This is general Perkins at the Pentagon. Whoever you are, please, respond. Open the door for us. I think we're headed for Africa. Ricky, I can't open the door. Son, open the door, please. First I gotta do a 180 and head back. Here goes. Hand flying's harder than I thought. Ricky, open the door. Unless we find a pilot on board, getting the door open won't help. Are there any pilots on board? The Captain requests assistance, just as back up. Anyone? Current or not. Good pay. Early retirement. Maybe real early. We have no takers. What in the world is going up there, Midge? Auto pilot engaged. Transglobal 40, do you read? Whoever you are, please, respond. I think he's coming too. Do you read me? Do you read me? Undo his belt. He'll make it with his pants off. Who's this? Get off this line. This is an emergency. - I agree. It's an emergency. - Don't mock me, kid. Get off this line We were supposed to have... the most secure communication system in the world. This is Transglobal 40. The kid's obviously been listening. He's some sort of hacker. I've got more than 50 souls on board. My database says that... Andrews Air Force base is the best option. Wait a minute, the pilot said he saw kids in the cockpit. Good Christ! Whoever this is, identify yourself. Capitain Richard Bernard. - You're a pilot then? - Yes, sir. I've got over a thousand hours on the 777. Richard, open the door, please. I can't now, dad. What the heck is going on? How old are you? Ten. What about these thousand hours? Air Hollywood Flight Simulation. It's all the same. It's the newest. The four O. He's got a point, sir. My son has that program... - and it's an excelent... - Wait. The President's plane is about to land at Andrews any minute, sir. He's returning from his fund raising trip. This is very suspicious, sir. I've got my Junior Pilot Wings. His what? They come in a cereal box. My son has one. - Andrews is out, whoever you are. - Copy that. Passengers and crew, sir. The one in Metro looks the best, I suspect. Where's Captain Noonan? He's out cold. Right here on the floor. I told you. I told you. OK, let's talk. Just tell me what you and your people want. I'm sure we can work something out. Get me a psych report on this one. Right away. What I'd like is, you to put a qualified adult in line... and give me some back up just in case. A pilot who knows the 777. OK, Richard, we're on it. We're requesting you a pilot to assist you while we figure out a place to land. Transglobal 40, what's your fuel status? 4.600 pounds. They're here. They've probably burned... any reserve with that detour. They should be more than OK to Metro. That's just what the kid said. Change redio frequency now to Metro. 120. 1. There's a pilot there to assist you. This kid has a string unexcused absences from PT. Clearly some kind of a misfit. Transglobal 40, this is Captain Exupery. Do you copy? He's only got fuel enough for one pass, if that. That's about 6 minutes from... from now. We're gonna need vectors to a straight in final approach. Whoever is talking, that's the right call. Roger that, Transglobal 40. We're clearing all the runaways. Holding all traffic. You're about 5 minutes out. Emergency crew, Everyone on your position. Senator, we do not have take off permission yet. The hell with that. We have priority. What's the use of being an US senator? Son, I'm on an official business. We'll take off now. That's an order. Yes, sir. You're the boss. That gives us one chance. I can see you intercepting. Now engage autoland. We've captured the localizer for runway one right. I think. We've got you. Runway one right. It's OK, we're locked in, The plane will land itself. I see the runway. My God, look at this! He's headed straight for them! Push the lever down on the top of the throttle! Pull up, pull up! My God! What was that? - Stall! Stall! - Hit that lever. - Stall! Stall! - Hit that lever! What are you doing down there? I had a landing! Is anyone in the tower? Son, you did a good job. Let's just try another coupling approach. I don't if I've got enough fuel to do a whole approach. Son... can you fly this aircraft manually? For God's sake, no! Put him on auto. He's just a kid. He has no chance. - They can go down in town... - Just decide. Every second we lose... - Can you hand fly the plane, son? - I don't know. Get her up to 600 feet. Then sharp bank to the right. Flame at right engine. No, our right engine flamed out. Turn now, and then line it. 330 degrees. That's it, boy. Approaching the localizer. Select autoland again. Come on, select autoland again. Are your flaps down? What about the gear? Very good. That's it, you're down. Pull reverse thrust levers all the way up. The brake pedals. Hit the brake pedals. What a boy! What a boy! That's it! Yes, sir! What a boy! Good job! Make that great job! Well done, Junior Pilot. What happened? It's OK. It's OK, sir. We've landed. You did it, Ricky! I'm not gonna say anything else about you being Spacey Casey again. A souvenir. Did you know they were on board with her? No, it was just a lucky coincidence. But it does show the value of having air marshals on board. Capitain, what happened? It's her! What you did was very... I'm so proud of you, son. I guess you don't have to play football to be a hero. You sure showed me. I believe this is yours. Well, sir, this is one treasure. But, the greater treasure is my daughter. I owe you her life. Perhaps you don't know, but I announced a reward... a sizeable reward for the return of both. You're a wealthy man. No, sir, the reward doesn't belong to me, but this gentle... well... this person. Thank you. OK, no. You're welcome but, it's my son, Ricky... who not only saved your daughter but all of us on the plane... by landing it. It's true, he did! It was all of us. If there's any reward, it should go to keep our arts program going... keep our teachers teaching and us kids making music. What did you say? Hands up. Turn. What are you doing? We should be on underway in a few moments now... and we look forward to a smooth flight tonight. Bye bye.
