Annabel! Crab cage coming up! On it, gramps! Your back. Oh, I'm fine. How much time do you think we have? About a few more hours. We still owe Mr. Dodds money on the booth. Everybody owes Dodds money. Hold in! He can wait. Ugh, he will not be happy. Uh, well, in my experience, rich people usually aren't. It is the curse of the bourgeois classes. So you keep telling me. You know, what I hear makes some people happy? A special lady friend. Anna. You know what? I've had enough special lady friends to last a life time. Your grandmother was a very special lady friend, God rest her soul. As was my previous wife, who now lives in my old house with her special friend. You know, to be happy-- ♪ All I need is a tall ship ♪ ♪ And a star to sail her by ♪ Ugh! Oh! Please, stop. And I need a first mate to clean the crab cages. I think the captain is supposed to clean the crab cages while the first mate relaxes in the sun. That would be mutiny! Not if you stop singing. Come on, let's get back to work. Alright, it's spread away and ready to go. Anna? Annabel? Good morning, Mitzy! Go for it, Mitzy! Mitzy's in a good mood today. That's because it's a good day. You know what? Every day is a good day. As long as I have my two girls. Is that right, Mitzy? Come on. Hey, Arthur, can you take my line? Sure, Jonah, no problem. How's the fishing? I ain't caught none yet. Around the green pole is fine. Right. Okay, buddy, how you doin' today? I'm happy. - Hey, Will, this one's heavy. - Yes, sir. - How you doing, Grace? - I'm Good, Jonah. - How are you? - Going well. Alright. You guys out late this morning. Good fishing? It was pretty good, Grace. Here, I'll show you. Alright. Thanks, buddy. Thanks for your help. - What about-- - Mmm. - This guy, huh? - Nice, nice. Oh! Will you leave that fish alone? Come and take these crabs to the restaurant. Yes, auntie. I finished that book you lent me, Mr. Coleridge. Oh, that's great, Will! Listen, anytime you want a book, there's plenty more where that came from. Oh, cool. Didn't I tell you to get going? Oh. Thank you. Hurry, just-- Oh, Jonah, no. I'll let Will come help you with that. Grace, I'm not so old man that I can't carry my own fish. Fine then, break your old fool neck. Don't mean a thing to me. Come on, Annabel. Alright. Bye, Annabel. Bye, Ms. Johnson. Alright, girl. - Morning! - Good morning! Good morning, good morning, good morning! How you all doin'? Hi, Mr. Ragsdale. Hello, birdie girl. Hi, birdie guy. Hello. Hello. Hi, Mr. Jenks. Any new jokes today? Well, let me think. Where do fish keep their money? In a river bank. Oh man. Alright. What made the fish blush? 'Cause he saw the ocean's bottom. Man, you know them all, girl! Okay. Oh, you know what? I'm gonna need some more ice. Okay. - See you in a minute. - Okay. Hi, Mitzy. Thank you. Do you know any good dolphin jokes? That's because there aren't any. Hey, Annabel! What do you get when you cross a messy room with a crawfish? What? A slobster. Oh my God! God! She did that on purpose! Mitzy is an impeccable judge of both humor and character. This is true. Come on, girl. Bye, Mitzy. How's your homework? Did you give in that essay on Alexander the Great? Yeah, I did. The teacher said it was kind of long. No. History is how we know who we are and where we're going. It defines us. It enlightens us. How can you have too much history? Apparently, when you help me write it. Oh. Well, is there anything else I can help you with? Math. You're on your own. Hey, Jonah? James, my old friend, I have the best and freshest stone crab on the island. Seriously. Between you and I, it would be a culinary crime if a less skilled chef than yourself were to walk by and deprive your hotel's guests of these decapod delicacies. Oh, 8 a pound. James, I am shocked. Shocked! After all the years I've known you, that the food should be taken out of my granddaughter's mouth by a man who I consider to be a friend, nay, a brother. Okay, you lil' pirates. - 9 a pound. - 10. And we'll throw in these fresh conch. Deal. Alright, here you go. Thank you. How are things at the center? Oh, they're okay. You know, business is down since the hurricane. When my son called it a "non-profit", he meant it. Your boy sure loved that place. Hmm, yes. He did. Annabel, time for school. Oh, okay. So I usually don't go for the blue. Mmhmm. I do want to get one more. Okay. I've got um, these short earrings that I'm really partial to. I think you might wanna see it. And um, some more bracelets. Oh yeah. Excuse me, sir, but I think you dropped your wallet. Hey, that's my wallet. It has all my money in it. It's all there. What a nice island boy, honey. Give him a reward. That's amazing. Oh, I like it in silver, too. I'll have that other bracelet-- I'm sorry, sir, but I couldn't possibly take your money. Please enjoy your time on the island. Thanks, kid. Duh. $100. Excuse me? I said-- $100. $100 for what? Well, I you wanna go on a fishing trip, it's $100 an hour. I supply reels for fly-fishing, but you bring your own rig for big game, and there is no smoking and no drinking on the boat. Well, I don't drink or smoke. Or fish. Well, then what are you doing on my boat? I'm lookin' for Jonah Coleridge. Oh, well, that's a coincidence! I'm looking at someone who is trespassing on my boat on a private deck. My name is Desaray Rolle. I work for the Freeport Social Services Department. And I was led to understand that there was a Jonah Coleridge who lived here with his granddaughter. Excuse me! What happened to Nole? Uh, Mr. Lewis retired. They sent me here from Nassau to take over his cases. Oh, that's too bad. I liked Nole. He couldn't fish worth a fart, but he was good company. So am I to assume that you are Jonah Coleridge? Well, you may assume whatever you like. Personally, I try to avoid conclusions before investigation, but you may do as you wish. Is that supposed to be clever? Yes. Sir, I do not have time for your games. Are you or are you not Jonah Coleridge? I am. Then why didn't you say so? Because I don't like people snooping around my home before they have the courtesy to ask for an invitation. I am here to examine the living situation of the minor who is in your care, Mr. Coleridge. Oh, I'm not questioning your career choices, Miss Rolle, only your manners. Hmm. Is this boat yours' and Annabel's primary place of residency? It is. And where is Annabel? Well, where would you expect her to be at this time? Hmm. She's coming home from school. Okay. Bye, Megan. Who are you and why have you been following me? I am Robert M. Carbunkle. My card. You're a barista? That says "barrister". There's an R at the end. You don't look like a lawyer. You look more like a pirate. I have a suit. Look can I get up? I don't feel like lounging in dead fish. Just don't try anything funny. I assure you the last thing I'm trying to be is funny. I am working-- I'm working for your grandparents on your mother's side. Samuel and Sheryl Williams. I haven't seen them in-- Nearly 10 years. They hired me to give this to you. That letter will explain everything. And if you are amenable, call me on the number on my card, then I'll arrange everything. Good day. Bye. So this place is a research center? Well, it's a non-profit marine research and conservation center. My son was a marine biologist. He came out to the island, fresh out of grad school, and fell in love with the place. He founded the center, and then he ran it by himself, and Debrah joined him later. Until they died, 10 years ago? Yes. And now, you own it? Well, in theory, Anna does. Oh, the staff run the center, but Anna helps with the dolphins. There's one in particular, she's very fond of. Hmm, that's nice. Well, yes, it is actually. And these people-- They live here I assume. Well, just my son's friends. Well, he said they could stay here and I saw no reason to change matters. Your son sounds like a very interesting person. He was the best man I ever knew. Do you make your living as a fisherman then? Yeah. I also do chartered fishing and diving tours. And there's my pension. Hmm. Thank you, Mr. Coleridge. I think I understand the situation. What situation is that, precisely? It will be in my report. Do you have problems expressing your opinions to peoples' faces, Mrs. Rolle? Or are you more comfortable hiding behind reports? I'm very comfortable sharing my opinion, Mr. Coleridge. Annabel, by all accounts, is a smart and hard-working young lady who has suffered a terrible tragedy. And, instead of accepting your responsibility to raise her in a safe and nurturing environment, you took advantage of the situation to retire to a paradise, play Popeye the Sailor Man and drink rumrunners with your friends all day. You don't know what you are talking about. - This is good place to live. - Hmm. There are some fine people here. Where is grandpa! Not now, Mitzy. Grandpa! Oh, just wait until I tell you about my way over-- Uh, oh-- hello. Hello, you must be Annabel. Um, Annabel, this is Mrs. Rolle from Social Services. She's come here to judge us. What do you have there, Annabel? Oh, a letter I got from a strange man. Anna, how many times have I told about talking to strangers? I only talked to him after I hit him with an oar. Did he try and harm you? Uh, no, he just took photos of me. He looked like a pirate, but he was just a lawyer. Wait. Uh, a lawyer gave you this letter? Yeah, I thought it was another bill collector. Oh you have a lot of late bills? Oh, yes. That's how we keep the bourgeois class at our mercy. Uh, Mrs. Rolle, we'll have to finish this later. Well, actually, I haven't finished my interview with Annabel. No, I must insist. I'm sorry. Please, excuse us. Annabel, I will see you soon. Oh, okay. Bye! What was that all about, gramps? Hmm? Oh, it's uh, nothing. Well, I wish you'd chosen another day to assault someone. He was a lawyer, gramps. Oh, well, that's alright then. You hungry? You don't seem happy about the letter. Well, it's not that. It's just that I haven't heard a word from your grandparents since we held memorial service for your mum and dad. Why would they suddenly want to see us now? Don't you like them? Well, we have a difficult relationship. Ain't that the truth. You know, the last time that your grandfather saw that weasely little city man, he punched him straight in the nose. Uh, Grace. What? He had it comin' and you know it. That fancy good-for-nothin' man strutting around here with all his airs and money tellin' everyone how things supposed to be. Now, his wife you know, she was nice enough, but that man, if your granddad hadn't hit him, I would have. Trust me. Grace, I think she's got it now. Oh, okay, fine. You don't want me tellin' the girl, you won't hear a word about it. And it's not like I don't know where I'm not wanted. Ooh. So what was the arguing about? Nothing. Oh, just a disagreement. It was a very difficult time. Maybe they wanna make up? Annabel, give me your hand. Do you want to see them? Well, they are my family. Right. Then I'll call the lawyer, we'll have lunch. - Okay? - Thank you! Zoe, get over here with that ice cream. Keep these comin'. I had a rough day and I'm eating my feelings, obviously. Okay. Yeah. Oh, Mr. Williams, sir. Yes, sir, I am just at the office right now I was just going over your files here How was your flight, sir? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Yep, we call that "island time", sir. People here uh, have a different relationship to time than-- Uh, oh, no, sir. No, you're absolutely right. They should have-- Yes, sir, uh, of course. No, sir-- I mean, yes, sir. Yes. No, I've arranged all of that. We're having lunch with them at your hotel, sir. Yes. And may I just say, sir, that I really appreciate the opportunity to be working uh-- Sir? Mr. Williams, sir? Jerk. Grandma! Grandpa! Oh, Annabel, look at you. You're so beautiful. Samuel, look at how beautiful she is. She's a vision, Sheryl. An absolute vision. Sheryl. Sam. This is Mr. Carbunkle. Oh, gramps, that's the lawyer. Ah! The man you payed to stalk my granddaughter. Mr. Carbunkle is a local barrister. He was recommended by my firm in New York to assist us in this matter. What is that you want, Mr. Williams? Sheryl and I think it's time to-- Anna, dear, how would you like to visit New York? Really? Wow, that would be awesome! Just-- I can't stay too long. You know, I have the center uh, and school-- Mmhmm. - And Mitzy, of course. - Uh, who is Mitzy? She's my best friend. She's a dolphin. I can't wait for you to meet her, grandma. A dolphin? How interesting. The ocean's pork. I once had dolphin in St. Vincent. It was delicious. Not fishy at all-- You know, Annabel, you are gonna love Mr. and Mrs. Williams' townhome in Manhattan. Best of the best of everything. Aren't you a lucky little girl? I don't understand. I'd like to speak to your grandparents, privately. Gramps. Now, please. Okay. Jonah, we just want to get to know our granddaughter. Fine, then get to know her here. And watch as you allow her to waste her life in this place? Uh, waste her life. You mean, like your daughter did with my son? Debrah was a grown woman. There was nothin' I could do about that. And there's nothing you can do about Annabel. David and Debrah's will made sure of that. Mr. Williams' law firm has filed a motion to review Annabel's custody and a local judge has agreed to a hearing. You've been served, Mr. Coleridge. There's also a check here for a quite tidy sum. That is reimbursement for Annabel's care over the years. It's more than I felt appropriate, but Mr. Williams is a very generous man. Anna will have the best schools and all the opportunities we can provide her. You can come and visit her anytime you like. We wouldn't think of keeping you apart. You want to buy Annabel. No, we would nev-- Just like you tried to buy off David, because you didn't think he was good enough for your daughter and Debrah hated you for it. My relationship with my daughter is none of your business! You haven't changed at all, have you? I suggest you be reasonable, Mr. Coleridge. Oh, do you suggest that, Mr. Carbunkle? Well, I suggest that you take your check and you roll it into a very tight ball and you shove it directly into his-- A guy like that, never listens to reason. What are our chances at the hearin'? About even. Tell you what though, money can goes a long way, if you would just let me take a pile of it-- No. I told you I want this all above board. This is about what's best for Annabel. Nothing else. Excuse me. I'm looking for a Mrs. Rolle. Oh, of course. - Over there. - Thank you. Mrs. Rolle, I understand you are the case worker for Anna Coleridge. And you are? A barrister? I represent her grandparents. I was wondering if I could get a copy of your report on Anna's situation? Oh, I haven't completed that report. I haven't interviewed Anna yet. Oh, I see. Are there any preliminary observations you could share? Unofficially, of course. Between you and me, her grandparents are very concerned about Anna's well-being. I can imagine. I've had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Coleridge. As have I. And frankly, I'm worried he isn't thinkin' about what's best for Anna. Oh, those kind never do. Beach bums on permanent holiday. Drinkin' all the time. Can't be relied on to put a child's needs ahead of their own. I've met a lot of men like that. I was married to a man like that. Well, it'll be completed in a few days. That'll be just fine, Mrs. Rolle. And thank you very much. Mmhmm. Yes, sir, but-- I s-- yes, but if-- Yes, sir. I agree with you, sir. Yes. Let me just say this though, I-- Yes, sir. The meeting did not go as planned, but there were human variables. And I tell you what, the one constant that you can have with human variables, especially officials, is money and that-- no, no, sir, I don't mean to bribe necessarily, but perhaps to grease a few palms, sir. Sir? Mr. Williams? Unbelievable! He did it again. Hey, are you tryin' to steal my wallet? I just found this and-- - I was gonna give it back. - Yeah, right. That's the oldest con in the book. You know, I'm a lawyer. A lawyer? I thought you were a pirate. I have a suit. Look, I can sue your parents for pain and suffering makin' me walk all this way. Stop it! Whoa! Wait a-- come on! Oh! That's why people eat dolphin. Wooh! Did you do that on purpose? Well, thanks, partner. Hey! Not that! My dad gave me that. Mitzy. Where did you get this? She got it from me. Mitzy would never take something that didn't belong to her. Yes, she would. You need to teach that fish stealing is wrong. Mammal. What? Dolphins aren't fish, they're mammals. And how do I know this is yours? It has my name written in it. Is your name "one size fits all"? Mateo. Mateo Rolle. I guess this is yours then. Wait. You have to have permission to come aboard. Permission to come aboard, Captain? Come ahead. I remember you. You have nerve calling Mitzy "a thief". I remember you, too. My name is Annabel. Is she yours? Mitzy belongs to Mitzy, but she lives here at the center. What even is this place? It's a wildlife research and conservation center. My parents founded it. They were marine biologists. Cool. You going to the fish fry tonight? Uh, I don't usually. Why not? Everyone goes. It's just I have a lot of work to do. Even a marine biologist takes a break once in a while. Maybe. Great. I'll see you there. Oh, ahoy there. Well, don't you look nice? I don't look nice. I look regular. Which for you is nice. - Where you off to? - Uh, me? Nowhere. I mean I was thinking about going to the fish fry. You know, by the marina. Yes, I know where the fish fry is. Who are you going with? Nobody! Hi, Mr. Coleridge. Hi, Anna. - Hi, Mr. Coleridge. - Hi, Mr. Coleridge. Are you ready to go? Hi. Nobody? Nobody but my girlfriends. You know, they're girls like Megan, and Kylie, and other girls. Bye. See you later. Oh, excuse me? Are you acting strangely or is this just 14 happening? How can I tell? Right. Come home early and no walking alone after dark. Alright, standard rules. Bye, see you later! I mean, see you early! David, Debrah, your little girl is growing up. God help me. ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ We don't care ♪ ♪ We got our hands in the air tonight ♪ ♪ We don't care ♪ ♪ We don't care ♪ ♪ We got our hands in the air tonight ♪ ♪ Everybody know I love to joke and I love to drum ♪ ♪ And I love to drink and sing ♪ ♪ Every time I around, the word around town is ♪ ♪ We always celebratin' ♪ ♪ They say we the life of the party ♪ ♪ What we do is so amazin' ♪ ♪ We love to slow wind ♪ ♪ Go ♪ ♪ We don't care ♪ ♪ We got our hands in the air tonight ♪ ♪ We don't care ♪ ♪ We got our hands in the air tonight ♪ And then after my parents died, my gramps, he came from England to take care of me. Now, I sort of take care of him. You're lucky. How is any of that lucky? Your parents wanted to be with you. My pops took off for the last time when I was about 9. And he only left me this hat. Do you wanna go and swim with me and Mitzy tomorrow? Yeah. Oh. But me and moms always hangs out on Sunday. She can come, too. It will be lots of fun. Great. I'll ask. Hey, moms. Hi. How was the fish fry? It was good. Huh, who was there? Um, a really super cool girl. Ooh, hoo, hoo, you met a really cool girl. Nice. Use a fork. Hmm. Do you have work tomorrow? Mm-mm. I have to finish a report on this girl and her grandfather, but I'll get that done early. So what do you wanna do tomorrow? Movie? Pizza? Actually, I've got a better idea. It's nice to be out. Oh, a girl over there. We here! You made it! You must be Mateo. Welcome to the conservation center. Thanks. Hey, you wanna swim with dolphins later? Yeah, thanks! This is my moms. You? Mr. Coleridge! I guess that my son has met your granddaughter. You guys know each other? Your mom is our social worker. She judges us. If this is too awkward, I can leave. Oh, no, no, no! Don't leave. You said you wanted to talk to me, remember? We can talk and swim. Right, gramps? Well, if your grandfather doesn't mind. Uh, yes. No, no, no. Um, you and Mateo are-- you're very welcome, Mrs. Rolle. Yay, great! So should we um Absolutely. I haven't seen Mateo have this much fun in a long time. Would you like to take a look around? I would. Thank you. Annabel, I'm gonna show Mrs. Rolle around. Okay. Bye! You see him? We don't mess with this one. You wanna come on here? There you go. She's one of our oldest birds. Okay, little one. Yeah. There you go. Can I get you a drink? I only have is soda and water I'm afraid. I made some tea this morning. You could have Anna's if you like. I'd love some tea. Thank you. This place is beautiful. It was my son David's dream. And Debrah's, too. They wanted Anna to be raised here. So how did you come to the island? Still finishing your report, Mrs. Rolle? I'm sorry. We got off on the wrong foot. Call me "Desaray". Jonah. And the fault was mine. I get over-protective when it comes to Anna. So what happened to her parents? They were killed in a diving accident 10 years ago. Mitzy was a juvenile then. She got snared in a fisherman's net. David freed her, but he got snared himself and Debrah tried to help. Oh, it's just one of those things that happens. Anna was 5 years old. I'm so sorry. I was teaching history at Cambridge. When I came back for funeral, I discovered that they'd appointed me guardian of Anna and left me their boat. So Anna and I have been shipmates ever since. Why didn't you take her back to England? You ever been there? No. Well, it's just like everywhere else I suppose. People fighting, and hating, and grabbing from each other, because they're scared. Scared of being left behind, scared of not having enough, scared of just being scared all the time. And I realized what a special place this island is and how remarkable the people in it are. Anna's all I have left of my boy. I wanted to teach her how to be happy. Instead, she taught me. You gonna put all that in your report? Uh, definitely. Oh, thank you, Mitzy. Mitzy is very tidy. Yes. I'm constantly going to the recycling center with whole bags of the refuse that she brings up out of the water. Oh. Oh, that explains it. Explains what? Nothing. Nothing. Oh, no, no, Mateo. You keep that, it's chilly. Oh, thanks, Mr. Coleridge. Thank you, Jonah, for a wonderful day, You are very welcome, Desaray. You and Mateo can come to the boat anytime you like. Or maybe next time we'll go out? Oh, I'd like that. See you later, Anna. Bye. - Alright, come on. - Bye. - Did you have a good time? - Of course. You? Yes. I think I did. I'm gonna go change. Sheryl, are you all right? I'm fine. The doctor said the last scan was clear. It was and I'm fine. It's just a cough. You fret too much. Sam-- I know the last few months have been hard on you. Is that why we're doing this? I'm doing this because it's the right thing for Annabel. She seems so happy here. But what kind of life will she have? She's a smart talented girl. She deserves more than this. She deserves her chance at the world. The chance Debrah never had. She's so like our Deb, isn't she? She is. When she's older, she'll appreciate what we're doing for her. I hope so. Oh, Mr. Williams, what can I do for you? My wife is becoming confused. We need to expedite matters. I will not lose Anna the way I did Deb. Is there anything more you could be doing? Not uh, within the parameters you established. Do what you have to do, but you get it done. Ah, Mr. Coleridge. Lovely day for boat fiddling. You. You know, I keep telling people that this is a private dock. You think I should put up a sign? You know, I wouldn't bother. My fishing license. It's been revoked. Yeah, it seems there were some irregularities when you renewed it. And commercial fishing without a license carries some hefty fines. Those will need to be paid promptly or your vessel here could be impounded. Fortunately, Mr. Williams' offer is still on the table. Sam Williams is not buying my granddaughter. Oh, of course he is. That's how the world works. Your world. Not mine. You know, you sit on this grubby boat, on this stinking dock, surrounded by losers and bums, and you wanna fight me? Look, make this easy and you'll still be in her life. But you make it hard, I will shut down this Dr. Dolittle fantasy of yours. And I guarantee you will never see your granddaughter again. Good day, Mr. Coleridge. Mrs. Rolle. I came by to return the towel you loaned Mateo and to tell you that your review has been officially closed. What's wrong? Uh, I just don't understand how people can be so terrible. Who's terrible? It's a long story. I'm a good listener. How about dinner? uh, um. Anna! What? What is it? - Oh, hi, Ms. Rolle. - Hi. Um, would you be alright fixing your own dinner tonight? Sure, why? Why, yes, why. Well, um, uh, Desaray and I, we thought we might-- Well, you know, we were thinking-- Really? No, no! - I mean, not if you need me to-- -No, no, no, no, no, no! This is great. Yaw-haw are great. Um, Ms. Rolle, just give us a second. Why? What's happening? You are not wearing those. Oh, I think I am. - Look, see? - No, no. You need to put on your nice pants. Well, these shorts are nice. Those shorts are the opposite of nice. Nice runs and hides from those shorts. Alright, I'll change. And your shirt. Shirt. Fine, fine. And put on your nice jacket! Yes, alright! He'll be right out. You're gonna love the jacket. That was your mother when she was about your age. She's beautiful. You look very much like her. So why didn't grandfather and her not get along? From the moment Debrah was born, She was everything to your grandfather. The two were inseparable. So much love. Sam thought Debrah had a great career ahead of her. But when your mother met your father, she left her position at UNICO and uh, came down here to work with him. Sam thought it was a waste of her talent. So he offered your father money to fire Debrah. A lot of money. Would have funded his research for years. David didn't even think about it. Wand when Deb found out, oh, the fight they had. I've never seen either of them so angry. I always thought that if Debrah had lived longer they would have found their way back together. But um Anna, your grandfather is a good man. He loves you very much. Then why do this? I think he's afraid of being alone. I don't understand. Good. You are far too young to understand that. I came here to give you something. This was your mother's. They returned it to me after the accident. It's beautiful. My mother gave it to me and I gave it to Debrah. I think she'd want you to have it. I love you, grandma. I love you, too. Thank you, my dear, dear Anna. I'm so grateful I got to hear that. And don't worry. Life has a way of working out just the way it's supposed to. So he just flat out threatened you? The thing is Desaray, I'm not sure he can't do what he says. Well, he'd have to have some pretty overwhelming evidence to get custody of a minor overturned. You and Annabel belong together. Everyone can see that. Uh, thanks. Huh. Still worried about Annabel, huh? Yes. Sorry. And my license. You can file an appeal. I mean, you can always file an extension. No one's gonna take Annabel away from you because an off-islander dug up a misfiled fishing license. You think so? I'm sure of it. Nice, Desaray. I mean, really thanks. Uh, you've been very good. I know how much you care about Annabel. And I wanna help you if I can. Uh, you have helped. Just by being a friend. I wanna be your friend. At the very least, I hope. - Good night. - Good night. Can I see you tomorrow? Absolutely. - Good night. - Good night. Desaray! Mr. Carbunkle. I was just at your office, they said you left early. Report all done? It is. I'm afraid you won't like it. Oh, that's disappointing. My report says that Mr. Coleridge is an excellent guardian and that Anna couldn't be in a more loving, supportive, and stable home. Really? Huh. You know, is there any way that you would consider reevaluating those conclusions? I understand you're a single mother on a government salary. Perhaps a consulting fee? You predecessor in this job is quite enjoying his early retirement from what I understand. You're responsible for Mr. Lewis' retirement? His relationship to Coleridge didn't seem helpful to our case. I thought it needed new eyes. You really don't wanna come down on the wrong side of this, Mrs. Rolle. I have no intention of doing so, Mr. Carbunkle. Hey, moms. Hey, honey. Are you doin' homework? Yeah. But seems like you had a good night. Good night. Hello? Hello? Mr. Carbunkle. Uh, Desaray isn't in yet. Oh. She asked me to meet her here. She said that she had some important information for me. Something about a old complaint about Mr. Coleridge. Uh, anything like that would be on the computer files. I could get that for you. That would be fantatsic. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Court today and all. Of course. I'll be right back. Thank you. Stable nurturing home environment. Recommended custody stay with Mr. Coleridge. I couldn't find the files you were lookin' for uh-- Mr. Carbunkle? Mr. Carbunkle? Well, good morning. Is everyone here? Your Worship, I am representing Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Williams-- Who in are requesting full legal custody Of their granddaughter Annabel and will present evidence that my clients are capable, both physically and financially, to provide for the child in a safer, more secure environment than she is presently being provided here to for. I see. Sit down. Mrs. Rolle, you are the case worker? - Yes, Your Worship. - Okay. Could you give us a report on Miss Coleridge's situation? Well, I have observed in the past week a very strong bond between Mr. Coleridge and Annabel. She appears to be a healthy, normal, and loved young lady. I object! Your Worship, speculation. Mrs. Rolle is not a trained medical physician and therefore cannot comment on the health of the child. Mr. Carbunkle, sit down. This is not TV. Now, I've read all the materials submitted by both parties and I can't say I see any urgent cause to change Miss Coleridge's living-- Your Worship, I move to submit further evidence. What other evidence? With the courts permission, I would like Mrs. Rolle to read a few paragraphs-- From her initial report submitted before she started an inappropriate intimate relationship with Mr. Coleridge. What? Mr. Carbunkle, that is a serious accusation. I have proof, Your Worship. Mrs. Rolle, you are aware that fraternization with a client during an investigation is against social services policies? Yes, I am, Your Worship. I have the report right here. Mrs. Rolle. I don't know where he got this. I-- Are you saying you didn't write it? No, I did. Well, then read it. "Annabel Coleridge is living with her grandfather Jonah Coleridge on his fishing boat. It appears they share the tiny bathroom And showering facilities. There was a distinct smell of fish everywhere." It's a fishing boat! - How-- - Mr. Coleridge, let her finish. "From my brief encounter with Mr. Coleridge, he seemed uncooperative, argumentative, and unconcerned with the whereabouts of his granddaughter. Mr. Coleridge took no action to address the issue but instead asked me to leave, denying me access to the subject of my evaluation. My preliminary recommendation would be to place the girl in foster care for her own safety and well-being until further investigation takes place." This is not what it seems. I revaluated and I revised the assessment. You mean you changed your report after you and Mr. Coleridge started sleeping together. We're not sleeping together! Sit down, Mr. Coleridge. Your Worship, in light of Ms. Rolle's unprofessional behavior, I move that her submitted report be stricken in favor of this more objective analysis of Miss Coleridge's living conditions. You can't do that! Mrs. Rolle! I suggest you be very careful. Your conduct has been appalling and I will be bringing this matter to the attention of Mr. Davies. Mr. Coleridge, do you have anything else to say? My son and his wife, they wanted to raise Anna on this island. The Williams' own daughter wanted Anna to grow up with the values that this place could teach her, surrounded by people who love her. Anna is happy here. She belongs here. With me. Deciding the fate of a child is always a very difficult decision. Now, I have no doubt about the love between Mr. Coleridge and his granddaughter, but I cannot ignore the facts in front of me. I hereby grant temporary custody to Mr. and Mrs. Williams, pending further investigation and of course a full review by the court. No! Sit down, Mr. Coleridge. You can't take her away from me. This is wrong! She's family! Oh, Jonah, please, don't make this harder for Annabel. - You are not taking her! - Bailiff. I need a bailiff in here. - Anna, we are going. - Jonah, please. Oh, you're not takin' her anywhere. You no longer have legal custody. I told you not to mess with me. Oh! Jonah, stop it! Jonah, please! I'm sorry, Ms. Johnson, I won't be able to help you with the tourist rush. Annabel, you'll never know how much we're gonna miss you, honey. Miss you. Please look after gramps for me, okay? Okay? You promise to stay out of trouble, okay? I will. I want you to take this with you. Your dad's hat? Keep it for me until I come and visit you. You're gonna be fine, girl. You'll be alright. You'll-- you'll enjoy New York. Anna, we should go. I won't forget about you, Mitzy. I love you. There's no point in making a fuss now. You're only making everything harder! I've been looking for you everywhere. I spoke with my supervisor and she says if we can find another social worker to review your case, after further documentation, we can get my official report reinstated. Do you know what you are? You're a hurricane. Hurricane Desaray. We were just living our lives. It was all fine. And then you blew in and turned everything into broken things. That's all we are now. Just broken things waiting on the beach waiting for the tide to wash us away. I didn't mean for any of it to happen. - I-- - No, hurricanes never do. They just blow in and blow out. There's nothing personal. They don't mean any harm, but if you get in theior path Jonah, please least look at me. Please. Storm's over, Desaray. I haven't got anything more for you to blow away. Here are your tickets and documents needed for your trip back to New York. Uh, I'll follow up with any additional paperwork you might need. Is there anything else I can do to be of service? No. you've done everything I asked very efficiently, Mr. Carbunkle. Well, we do aim to please, sir. And I hope you'll keep me in mind for your future legal needs or anything else I can do to be of service. We should get to the airport. You're not going anywhere! How dare you try and take way this girl from all the people who love her. Ms. Rolle, this is not the time for-- I'm not talking to you, you dirty, lying, cheating, conniving, weird pirate! Weird? This is between me and these people. This is none of your business. We're doing what's best for our granddaughter. No, you're not! You are doing what's best for you and I'm sure that's all you've ever done your entire privileged lives! All you have to do is look at Annabel to see that she's heartbroken. You're doing this because you-- you pushed your daughter away all those years ago, and now she's gone, and there's nothing you can do to bring her back. Nothing. Certainly not torturing this young girl and the man who's dedicated his life to taking care of her the way your daughter wanted him to. Samuel, this has gone too far. Sheryl, we discussed all of this. If we want to be part of her life, we should move here and be a part of her life, not force her into ours. That was what we did to Debrah. Let's not make that mistake again. I don't know anymore. Mr. Williams, You're not actually taking this woman seriously, are you? No, you did not just put your hand in my face. And what if I did? Anna? Anna? Anna? Annabel! Huh. What is she doing? I'd guess running away. Why would she do that? You really don't have a clue, do you? Well, where would she go? Anywhere. She knows this island like the back of her hand. We need to get some help. What can we do? There's a restaurant on the leeway side of the island called "Coconuts". Its' owned by a woman named "Grace Johnson". Go there and tell her what happened! I'll get Jonah. - Right. - Okay. That woman assaulted me. That was assault! You saw it. They were witnesses. I will sue! Shut up! Did you hear what she said to me? - Mr. Carbunkle. - Yes, sir? Shut up! Unbelievable! I've been out here all week. Look, I'm just tryin' to get a hold of this boat, I wanna go, I wanna have a good time in the ocean, you know? I can't just-- How much longer is this gonna take? I need to replace the fuel pump, change the batteries. I think it should be done in a couple of hours. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, hey, hey! We need your help. What are you two doin' here? No, no, it's Anna. She's run away. - What? - She's gone! - She's disappeared! - Okay, alright, everyone quiet! Okay, when did she go? About half an hour ago. Maybe longer. Well, she couldn't have gotten far. Um, Will and Megan, you're gonna check the marina and Jonah's fish stand, okay? - James-- - Yeah. Check the local piers and Lighthouse Bay. Okay. Arthur, just call everyone you know and have them lookin', okay? Right away. Everyone else just come with me, alright? Wait. What can we do? Haven't you two done enough? Stop. Listen, that's their blood. Okay, you two, you're gonna come with me, alright? What is everyone standing for? Let's go! Yeah, let's go! Go, go. Jonah! Jonah. Desaray, I told you I can't-- It's Annabel! - I don't wanna talk about Anna-- -Annabel's missing! She's run away and no one knows where she is. well, we need to get help. The Williams went to tell Grace. Well, we have to check her school and the marina, and her friends. Come on! Ugh, what's wrong with it? Mayday, mayday, this is Annabel Coleridge, approximately 5 miles in North North East of Lighthouse Bay. Uh, do you read? Oh, great. I have a dead radio. And no life jackets. Mitzy, am I glad to see you! I know, this wasn't a good idea, but now is not the time. I need help. Do you understand? Take this to grampa. Do you understand? Home, Mitzy! Grandpa! Hurry, girl, hurry! She's nowhere in the center. And she didn't come back here. Jonah, there's no sign of her. I'm so sorry. James, anything? Nothin', Jonah, nothin'. - Will, Megan? - We checked everywhere. No one's seen her. Where can she be? It's like the girl just evaporated. Maybe we should call the police. Mitzy, stop! Just stop it. Uh, listen um, have you tried the grocery store? Did anyone see here there? - Are there no boats? - No, no boats. You sure? You checked them all? What's it got in its mouth? Mom, I think Mitzy knows where Annabel is! - Oh, Mateo. - Look! What is it? It's my hat! I gave it to her before she left. She was wearing it this morning. Mitzy. Mitzy! Can you show us where Anna is? Are you sure? Is that even possible? It's worth a try. Come on! Will, undo my boat lines! Sam! Sheryl! Come on. I hope you're proud of yourself. Judge Swanson? It's Robert Carbunkle calling about the report. Yes, sir, I have a confession to make. Mateo, go forward. Standby to let go the anchor. Yes, sir. Any sign of Annabel? Not yet. Well, it looks like Mitzy knows where she's going. Yes, I hope so. I see her. - Okay! - I see her. Oh, there she is! There she is. Mateo, is she on the boat? I think so. I got you. Yeah, hang on, sweetheart, I got you. Anna. Mateo, let go the anchor! Yeah! Can you see her? No. Jonah, I see Mitzy! I'm not sure where Anna is. Mateo, take this, get up on the roof. Go, go! I can't find her! I can't find her! Lord, please. The sea took our Debrah. Please, don't let it take our Annabel. Mitzy, try again, girl. There they are! I see them, I see them! I got you, come on. Come here, I got you. That's it. Oh. That's it. Oh. Oh. Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby girl. - Thank God, Anna. - Thank God. I think you lost this. I told you it was a good hat. It is. I thought I'd never see you again. I'll always be there for you, Annabel. You know that. I'll always be there for you. Yes, you will. Anna, Jonah is right. This island is your home with him and all these strange and wonderful people who love you so much. Please, Anna, forgive an old fool? Of course, grandpa, I love you. Thank you, Sam.
