(Multicom Jingle) (light music) - [Man] So Crystal was by herself, and this is when your father came into the room? What happened then? - He's layin' over her like he was gonna help her with her homework or somethin', but what he was really doin' was lookin' down her dress. (audience gasps) - [Man] How did your mother react to this? - Like it wasn't happenin'. My mama shoulda been born one of them birds that stick their head in the sand. - [Man] An ostrich? - Yeah, exactly. She shoulda been born a ostrich. - So your mother ignored what was going on between Crystal and your father? - Yeah, just like always. And then Daddy starts telling Crystal how pretty she is, how he bets that all the boys can't hardly keep their hands of her and how if he was 16 again, he'd be chasin' after her too. - [Woman] Everything is so elaborate. I mean, at Margolis, we were all sort of shoehorned into these cubby holes. - Oh, Howard's show is a first-class ride. He insists on it so does Sadie. - Are you sure I don't need an appointment? - Trust me, it's better this way. - It's hot, ain't it? A real scorcher of a night. A night like this, ain't nothin' better than a ice cream. - [Man] Hey, she has her father's mustache. (men laughing) - And Crystal over here, she says she's the same way. How when it gets hot and close and she gets to feelin' sticky all over and all she can think about is the ice cream. And then the two of them, they go off together like they was on a date or something. (audience groans) - I got to go prep the next one, okay? - [Host] Okay, we've heard from Lucille-Ann. - Now there are two green rooms. Ever since Sadie came on board, she likes to keep the opposing sides separated, so if there's a fight, it happens in front of the camera as opposed to back here. You know what she calls them? Holding pens. - That's terrible. - (laughs) Well, wait until you meet some of the guests. - Teri, Sadie needs you on the floor. - Okay, 30 seconds, Jimmy. Just give me 30 seconds. And remember, be honest with him. Tell him everything you told me. They'll be with you every step of the way. - Oh, Teri, this is-- - Not now, later, sorry. - Hi, bye. - That's Teri. She's one of Sadie's people. She's a little tense. - Yeah, oh, I'm starting to feel like I should've stayed in Chicago. - No, come on. You belong right here in New York with me. All you gotta do is sell yourself to Sadie. That didn't come out quite right, did it? (audience applauding) - Randy, come on out. - When is she going to cry? - Cry? - Dammit, Teri, do you want our audience surfing off to Oprah? I told you, I want tears or a fight within the first segment. - Okay. - [Howard] Crystal be honest, level with me. You're an attractive young woman, you had to know people - Right, just between you and me. - would start to talk when you began spending time with a married man almost twice your age. - Sadie wants you to stay off Howard's back. His battery pack's showing through his jacket. - Sadie wants you on the floor now! - Okay! - Butt shots, I need lots of butt shots. - Howard Grant is wired? - Sadie's idea. She's into cue cards too. She doesn't like him working without a net. - What the hell were you doing? It is a five minute drive to the Dairy Queen, okay? You guys were gone for an hour! - Ask him why his wife didn't join him on the show. Howard, come on, this is falling apart. - [Randy] Hey, hey, hey, we wasn't gone for more than 20 minutes. - Hang on, hang on a second now, Randy, hey, come on. Folks, take a breath now. Wait just a second. Randy, question for you now. Why didn't your wife join us on the show? - [Audience] Yeah? - Wasn't that scarecrow here last week? - Hello, we interrupting your nap? Take three. She's here every week. - How did she slip by Alan? - Take two. Alan loves her. She asks great questions. Ready four. Take four. - You are nothin' but a slut. Okay? You nothin' but a slut. - [Director] Three, pull back. - Well, we're certainly not shy of our opinions here on the Howard Grant Show. What happens when flirtation becomes seduction? When we come back, - Ready bumper, take two. - we'll introduce you to a young woman with the answer. - Music up. Cue bumper. And fade. - [Teri] Okay, you're up next. - Oh, I don't think I can do this. - Sure you can. You're gonna go out there, you're gonna tell your story, and you're going to feel a whole lot better for it afterward. I've seen it over and over. People hold a thing inside, it eats away at them. They come on the show, they get it out in the open. (fingers snap) They get rid of it! - Oh, I don't know. - It's gonna be fine. I'll be right there, and I'll support you all the way. But remember, you've got to get the audience on your side, so be honest. Tell them everything you told me, okay? - Okay. - Okay, good. - Your mother and I-- - Look, Dad, you're not even listening to me. - I am, and I want to hear your side of the story, but this isn't the time or the place. - Dad, I am not one of your guests, and I'm not gonna let you talk to me like one! - [Howard] Ted. - Dad, just do the show. (bell ringing) - Bad timing. - Thank God, you saved my life. Hurry, there's no time. Come on, come on. - This is Alan, our audience coordinator. - [Alan] Come on, I'm dying here. - Are you okay? - Yes. He's just going through something. - Empty seat's the kiss of death, you know what I mean? Smile. (upbeat music) (audience applauding) - We've been talking to young women whose fathers flirt with their friends. But what happens when dad's flirtations turn serious? Meet Wanda, whose best friend is now her mother. (audience ohs) (audience applauding) Wanda, help me out here. You and your father used to be close, didn't you? - We was real close. My mama died when I was born and all, but that was before him and Thelma started, uh, sleepin' together. (audience groans) It just tore us apart. And then they got married. I couldn't believe it. I still can't. - She's going down. She's going down. - I started - Tighter. - to put on weight. It's just that I miss him so much. (crying) - She's down! She's down! - I ain't standin' back there and listenin' no more. (audience groans) - This is - I'm telling you, he's great for Thelma. - This is Vernon, Wanda's father, and his wife Thelma. - Go home! - And they're anxious to tell their side of the story. - No story to tell. We met, we fell in love, and we got married. - That's right. - [Vernon] Now what's the harm in that, huh? - Well. - I think Wanda here, I think she's just jealous, that's all. - That's right. - Daddy! - Jealous? - Hell, yes. She's used to havin' me all to herself. (audience groans) Just, just don't sit right with her now she's got to share. - Are you saying-- - I'm sayin', I'm man enough for both of 'em. - [Audience] Oh! - Daddy. - Yes! - Plenty to go around, huh? - I felt like I was refereeing a wreck. But shows like this pay for the ones that really matter. We feed the audiences transvestites and strippers and then hit them with something really thoughtful, like next week's segment on race and intelligence. - I will never forget the show you did on the Klan. I mean, I saw that one and I knew, well, that I had to work in talk. - You know, I'm really embarrassed about today's show. - Oh, no. - Excuse me, Howard. Diane's been summoned. - Oh, well, it was really, really nice meeting you. - You too. - [Sadie] Talk to me. What have you done? - Well, I majored in communications at Iowa State, and then I did the news at WNXT in Chicago-- - I'm not interested in news. I'm interested in talk. - Diane was an AP at the Margolis Show. She'd made producer, then they got canceled. - Well, we don't do issues here. We don't do issues, not anymore-- - I know, but I-- - We do theater. Confrontation, conflict, drama, that's what the audiences are buying, that's what we're selling. You want to do issues, you talk to Bill Moyers. Issues killed Margolis. It almost killed Howard. Look, Jenny says that you're okay, so I'm gonna give you a chance, one month, four shows. You deliver, you're on staff. You let me down, you join Margolis in the unemployment line. - I never made producer at Margolis. - Oh come on, scruples or some of the collection of overdue bills? Look, you didn't have the title, but you did the work. Besides, his show is gone. Who's she gonna check with? - You're so bad, Jenny. - And you are a producer. (rock music) - He practically invented talk, Mom! I know. I know that. He's really embarrassed about that too. It's just this new executive producer that he has. You know, next week's shows are gonna be a lot. Wait, what? I, you know what, I can't hear you very well. Why don't I, I'll call you back when my phone gets hooked back up. Yeah. I love you. I'm gonna make you proud, Mom. Tell Dad I love him too. Bye. - Hey, what'd they say? - Well, they said that Howard was beginning to sound a little like Geraldo, and maybe I should come home. - Oh yeah, Howard is still Howard. He's just been fightin' for his life. I mean, when the ratings come back-- - Yeah, I know. I know, and in the meantime, I figure I can convince Sadie to do anything with a sensationalistic hook to it, even if it does have some meat on it. - I don't know, Diane. Sadie's not into causes. You do the sort of thing you were pushing at Margolis-- - Look, I am gonna do the kind of shows I wanna do by convincing Sadie that they're the kind of shows that she wants to do. Ooh, who is the hunk? - Mark Holston. Outside counsel to the show. He just bailed us out of a $10 million lawsuit by taking the plaintiff apart on the stand. Sadie's been panting after him ever since. So he works on Sadie by night and the Lula Belle Barton case by day. (laughs) It's kinda like watching cobras mate. - What is this? - A celebration. It's on Sadie. She just doesn't know it. To money in the bank and life in the fast lane. - Don't hang up, okay? No, don't hang up. Look, I don't think you understand the situation here. I told Howard you were coming, and he's dying to meet you. He's. Damn! - I don't have a show. - What? - I don't have a show. - [Teri] Neither do I, Myra. Now go to your kennel and let me slash my wrists in peace. (rapid music) - I don't have a-- - I know, Myra. You don't have a show. And neither will I unless you stop pestering me. (people chattering) - [Myra] I don't have a show. - You must be Myra. Hi, I'm Diane. - Welcome to the rack. - Congratulate me, girls, the warden has given me my release. - Oh, God. - [Woman] What are you gonna do, huh? - I don't know, dig ditches, clean sewers. Something with dignity. - There goes another one of Howard's people. - It's 11 o'clock, guys. The dragon lady awaits. - Terrific. Another great story ruined by checking. We're taping your segment tomorrow, Myra. I'm going to be very annoyed if we don't have anything to put in front of the camera. Alex, talk to me. What have you got? - Girls in gangs, pretty much virgin territory. - There's no such thing in talk, not anymore. You got rival gang members? - And their boyfriends. - That's good. Tell Nick to beef up security. Okay, new girl on the block, let's hear it. - I was looking over last month's shows, and I saw that Howard's ratings really went through the roof when he went out on the street and talked to prostitutes. So I thought we could bring back one of those girls and maybe bring-- - Howard's got to talk to you. He says it can't wait. - Back in five, folks. - Okay, what's that all about? - You should try reading the trades. - He's upset about the announcement from United Media. They're giving his son a talk show. - Why would that make him upset? It's his son. - Demographics. He doesn't want to compete with a younger version of himself. Unless I miss my guess, he's out there wringing his hands. A pound of flesh, that's what he's taking from me. All these Saturday meals will take a piece of my heart. (people laughing) - Bravo, Alex. But I catch you again, and your act's going to be canceled, permanently. Now, prostitutes. Is there one hooker in this entire city that hasn't guested on a talk show? (some people laugh) - We've had most of them right here on our own. - But we haven't had their families. Most of these girls are addicts. I mean, we know that. That's why they're out there hooking, right? I mean, that's double impact right there. We bring their families on with them, and that dramatizes the human cost, the other victims in this victimless crime. - Well, what have we got here, boys and girls? Could it be, a new angle? That's what I like about fresh blood. Okay, you got it. Now, one last thing, the party Wednesday evening for the stations that carry the show. Everyone attends. These people are our bread and butter, folks, and I want every last one of them to feel a part of our happy little family. Understand? Okay, get out of here and get to work. (pulsing music) - [Prostitute] Whatever, the only action around here, if you know what I mean. And besides, in my line of work, we like to keep what we call a low profile. - Yeah, I completely understand that. There would be no cops. - Well, college girl, (speaking in foreign language) But you see, there's one other little problem. It's been a while since I've seen my mother, 10, 12 years maybe. I don't even know what she looks like. - You know what, it's okay. Thank you. - Hey, hey, you looking for some salsa tonight? Her? Hey, hey, come on. Honey, it's a career opportunity. He's asking for you. - What's up, babe? - [Sadie] And? - [Diane] Well, I guess you could say he offered to sponsor me. - I'm thrilled for you, but the bottom line is you don't have a guest. No guest, no show. Sit down. Look, I like you, kid. You got guts. It took guts to lie to me that you produced for Margolis. You thought I wouldn't check, and it took guts for you to go out on the street like that. Look, if you want to be a success in talk, you gotta use your head too. So let me give you some advice. Never tell a lie you can get caught in. Never hit the streets without backup. And never, ever admit to failure. Now, this is a good idea you have, but it's not gonna amount to much if you go out on the street and you get yourself whacked. I had Jimmy yank the letters that came in after last month's show on prostitutes. Unless I've missed my guess, what you're looking for, you'll find right there. - Thanks. Thanks, Sadie. - I don't want thanks. I want a killer show. (phone buzzes) Hello. - [Secretary] Mark Holston on two. - [Sadie] Yeah, put him through. (tense music) - Sure, I can believe it. My girlfriend's the same way. - Your girlfriend? - [Alex] I lie all the time, don't you? - No, she doesn't, Alex, and neither should you. - No one's calling me back. I might as well start clearing out my desk. - Oh yeah, you should do that, Myra. - They won't call back. I know they won't. (phone ringing) Hello. How the hell are you? Listen, I'm so glad you called. That story of yours is the funniest thing I ever heard. - Jenny. Listen to this. Dear Howard, I am writing to you because I don't know where to turn. Every day, my daughter breaks my heart. She's only 19, but her life is already over. She's a drug-addicted prostitute and the mother of a two-year-old girl. I am at my wit's end with her, but your show gives me hope. - Oh. - This is it. I mean, this is the one. I can help these people. I can put the daughter through a treatment program. I can show the audience what the cost of prostitution is, and I can give Sadie ratings to die for. - I love subways. You get all those suits down there in the filth and darkness rubbing elbows with the derelicts and the rest of the sewage from the slums. It's the same thing in talk. We take the audience for a tour of the underbelly, the lower depths, and we introduce them to the ghetto garbage and the trailer trash. And then we send them back to their clean, safe little lives. That's why this piece of yours is perfect. The audience can shake its head. Isn't that tragic? Then go to sleep happy because it's not their daughter who's out hooking for a fix. So how did you talk this girl into coming on the show? - Oh, um, well, I haven't actually spoken with her. I spoke to her mom, and her mom seemed to-- - Wait a minute. You come in here, and you tell me you want to build a whole show around this girl and her family, and now you're telling me you haven't even talked to her? - Sadie, nobody knows exactly where she is. If you just give me a few days, I'm sure-- - Forget it. Your show tapes on Friday. You find another girl. (phone buzzes) Or find another job. I'm in a meeting. It's for you. - Hello? Sadie, Sadie, it's the mother. It's her. Yes, um, this is Diane Shepherd. - [Woman] Oh, thank God! - Have you found Kelly yet? - [Woman] Well, she's here, but her pimp's with her. And I'm scared, and she's looking really sick. And he's trashing the place looking for money. I've never-- (dial tone humming) (dramatic music) - Okay, this girl may balk at doing the show. If she does, figure out what she wants and then you offer it to her. Remember to wait for the camera crew. They spend a lot of time on the streets. They know how to handle themselves, so don't go in without them, okay? - Okay. - Oh, here. - Thanks. - All right. Good luck. (tense music) (speaking in foreign language) - Check it out. (dramatic music) (baby crying) (people yelling) - [Man] Here we go, my fault. (something breaking) It's always my fault! Oh, it's never your fault. (people yelling) - [Man] Yeah? - Um hello, is this the Reilly residence? - I don't know, might be. Hey, uh, uh, Brenda. What's your last name? - [Brenda] I want you outta here! - [Woman] Reilly. - Looks like you came to the right place. - I tossed the whole room - Uh huh. - and nothing. Who's that? - [Man] I don't know. - Hi, I'm Diane Shepherd. - What did you get? What did you dig up? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing. - You wouldn't happen to have a little something you could loan us? See, we're experiencing a little cash flow problem, and Kelly here needs some groceries. Don't you, honey? - Sorry, I spent all my money on the cab over here. - Cab fare. It's terrible, isn't it, what them cabbies charge? Nothing less than highway robbery. I'll tell you what, why don't you take a little look-see in that purse of yours just to kinda make sure? Thank you. - That's it? That's all? Two lousy dollars? Boy, you travel light, don't you, honey? - Just like my mama said, you want something done right, do it yourself! God! - Did you say who you are? - Diane Shepherd. I'm a producer from the Howard Grant Show. I'd like to talk to you about being a guest. - That's real funny, Mom, but I got an even better idea. Why don't we all go on American's Funniest Home Videos and give the folks a real laugh. - Kelly, they want to put you in a treatment program. They can help you get clean, help you get little Joey back. - Uh, a treatment program. I haven't heard that one before. - [Grandmother] We just want our sweet little girl back again. - Well, you know what I want? I just want to get well. - [Grandmother] Hey you, get outta there! You know you're not welcome here! How can you let him do this? I held you, and I loved you when you were a baby. When you took off with Jeri, I was always here for you! - That's the problem! If you weren't always trying to take her away from me, maybe I'd-- - You were the one that was always fightin' with her. - Shut up! You're always doing this! You're tearing me to pieces! You're always like this! Go ahead, cry, cry, Mom! Cry, cry! Oh baby, let's split. - Oh, Brenda, Brenda. 10, 15, 20. 20 bucks. It's a start, right? What did you say you did again? - She just wants to put me on some TV show. - Oh yeah? - The Howard Grant Show. - No kiddin'? I know that show. I know that show. Well, you know, you should be talkin' to me then, 'cause I'm Kelly's, I'm her business manager. How much they pay for one of them-- - That is none of your business. - Hey! What do they pay for one of those uh guest appearances? - Well, um, ordinarily, we don't pay our guests. We just give them an opportunity to talk about whatever's bothering them. - Yeah, yeah, but you wouldn't be opposed to a little, uh, what's the word? Help me out with this will ya? Honorarium! A little honorarium. - Dwayne, please. I gotta go. - I know, I know! I am just having a little business conversation, all right? - No, it's not all right. I am sick. I have to go. Okay? - Okay, okay. - We've been here for hours. - We gotta go. We have to go on a little shopping trip. Why don't you come along with us? This way, we can continue our little negotiation. You want her on the show or not? (tense music) - Maybe, maybe we should wait for my car. - I can't wait. - Can you believe this? - [Kelly] I can't wait. - It never fails. When you don't want a cab, the streets run yellow with the damn things! (horn honking) Oh! Am I poison? (Dwayne whistles) All right, here we go. - Wow, wait a minute. That's not a cab. - Sure it is, sure it is. - No, it's not a cab. - That is what you call a entrepreneur, doesn't waste his time on details like stupid paint jobs. - [Diane] But I don't think you sh. - Hang on. Avenue M and 14th Street. Now, where were we? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. See what you've got to realize is that Kelly is special. She is just, she's real class. She does not work the streets anymore. Not since I've become her business manager. All of our business is strictly by appointment only, if you catch my meanin'. The way I figure it is she is worth so much more than any garden variety hooker that you're just gonna pick up on some street corner. - Listen, buddy, I just remembered. They got Central all blocked up. Construction. We're gonna have to go the long way around. - The long way? - [Driver] Gonna have to charge you more. - Really? - [Driver] 20 bucks. - No kiddin'. Well, whatever you think is fair. (dramatic music) - What are you doing? - Where I come from, a deal's a deal. - What are you doing? What is he doing? - But one thing I can not abide by is a cheat. So now I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to pull over. - Oh God, please. - Frisk him. Uh uh. - Ha ha! Bingo. - Are you offering me a cash settlement over our little business dispute? - Whatever you want, mister. - But you know something, it's not enough. Now, if you were to throw in the car, I might see my way clear of calling us even. - Sure, mister, sure. - Oh, so we have a deal then? - [Driver] Whatever you want, mister. - Good, you just open up your car door there and let yourself out. (dramatic music) Pleasure doing business with ya. So you understand what I'm saying, right? That Kelly is just a very special girl, and I think she deserves more than what an ordinary guest would get. Wouldn't you say? - I do. I do, but like I was trying to say before, we don't ordinarily... You know what, I'm sure that we could come up with some sort of an arrangement. - Good. Good. I was thinkin', I don't know, five. - Well, I'd have to talk to my boss, but I-- - I ain't goin' on no TV show. - Pleasure doing business with ya. And now, if you will excuse us, we have another little piece of business to conduct inside. Be right back. Hey, it's Dwayne, open up! Oh ho, what's up? (bottle breaking) - [Diane] No! - Open up the door! Open the door! - Jimmy, hi, it's Diane. (horn honking) - Diane! Are you all right? - Yeah, Jimmy, I'm fine. Quick, get out of the car. I want to get some footage of this guy. Oh come on, quick, before he gets away! Please, hurry! - Dear Howard, I am writing to you because I don't know where to turn (phone ringing) - Cut. - God. - What? - I'm so sorry. - Jimmy, dammit. - What? Hi. Yeah. Diane, it's for you. - Shepherd. - [Sadie] Diane. - Oh, Sadie, hi. Yeah, yeah, I've been trying to get in touch with you all morning. - Well, I understand you had another little adventure. - Yeah. I know, the video crew hadn't shown up. - Did we have a conversation about backup, or did I just imagine it? - Oh, I know. I'm sorry, Sadie, I am. - [Sadie] Why did you call? - Okay, um, well, Kelly's boyfriend, he wants $500, and I don't know what to do because at Margolis we had a policy never to pay our guests. - Yeah, well, the money's on the way. Get back to work. - [Diane] Okay. Where did she go? - She's inside. She's having second thoughts. - [Diane] What? - You really think it's best? - I know it is. (gentle music) This is right for Kelly. It's gonna help her. It's gonna help a lotta people. Jeri, just think about it. Think about the people watching the show. If it turns around just one girl who is heading in the direction that Kelly was, who knows, maybe it'll keep a Dwayne out there from exploiting a young girl like Kelly. This is so important, Jeri. It's important for Kelly. It's important for you. It's important for Brenda. It's important for so many people you don't even know. - All right. But you know I don't read so well. Maybe you could just get Howard to read my letter? - Oh no, you have to read it. You read it so beautifully. They're your words. Just think about how you felt when you wrote them, okay? You hold onto that, and everything'll be perfect. - You talk to these girls with such understanding, and you treat them like human beings instead of garbage that belongs in the gutter. So I know you will hear me too. Please, Howard, help me save my daughter. Help me stop the pain. (Jeri crying) - Uh, cut. Cut. Hey, you okay? - I'm sorry. - No. - No, I just have such a hard time talking about this. - You were beautiful. You were just beautiful. Uh, look, why don't you go back up to your apartment, okay? We'll be up to tape you and Brenda together. All right, um, let's get some B roll. Uh, the streets, garbage piles, anything that'll give us a sense of place. - Okay. One, two, three, four, five. - Listen, are you sure she's okay about this? - Oh yeah, of course she is, of course. Yeah. If she gives you any trouble at all. You just, you know, you just talk to me. Okay. - Sure he talked to me, nice and sweet. Said if I don't do it, he'd kill me. - Well he was kidding, right? - I said, "What am I, a freak in a sideshow?" He says, "If you don't do it, "you're gonna be a side of beef in a meat locker." That's a big joke, huh? Look, I'll do it. Get the old broads off my back. I mean, why should I even care, right? - Because you should care. Kelly, this is gonna give you a chance to get your life back. - When you get to where I am, you don't go back. I'm on the express, one way to the end of the line. It don't matter what I do. They're not stoppin' the train for me. Will you give me a sec, okay. I gotta fix my face. - Kelly? - [Kelly] Yeah? - Oh, I'm sorry. We just, we really have to roll. (Kelly coughing) Are you okay? - I'm fine now. Let's just get this over with. - Smile. Yeah, that's a pretty picture. Hey, is this all there is to this? - [Diane] Jimmy, please. Can you take care of this? - [Dwayne] I can do this. - Okay, Kelly, please sit in the red chair. - Oh God. Kelly, not for the interview. - Do you have no respect? You do this terrible thing to yourself in my house, in my bathroom? - All right, Brenda. Um, Jeri, I need you to wait in the other room, okay, until we're done. It's just that Kelly's gonna have a really hard time with this, and I don't want her to be distracted. Please. Thank you. Okay. Are we rolling? - Um hmm. - Did you shoot up before this interview? - It's good. - Why, Kelly? - Mm. Look around you. - Kelly? Kelly? - Hmm? - Kelly, why are you here? - On TV? - No, why are you here with your family? - I needed some money. - Does your family give you money to buy drugs? - No. I take it. - How do you feel about that? (dramatic music) What about prostitution, Kelly, how does that make you feel? Do you ever feel, uh? - Why do you keep on asking me how I feel? I don't feel anything. - Kelly. Kelly? - Honey. - What's happening? - She's fine. - Oh my God. Oh my God, is she overdosing? - Open your eyes, come on. No, she's fine. - Kelly? - Kelly? - [Dwayne] She's fine. She's fine. - Oh God, Jimmy, call 911. (everyone yelling) - She's fine! - No, Mom, he was right. She was fine. She just passed out. Thank you. Well, no, that's the whole point here. We're trying to get her to top being the victim, Mom. Mom, it's best if I don't talk to you during work, okay? I. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm under a lot of pressure. I was up all night. I was editing the videotape, and. (sighs) Look, my boss is coming in. I gotta go, okay? I'll call ya later. Yes, I love you too. Bye. - That's it? - Um, well, no, there's more crying at the tail end of the tape. - (sighs) Play it out. Lay some music over it, something plaintive. You dig up anything on her kid? - Well, I spoke with social services, and the record's sealed. - Keep pushing. There may be some way around that. Okay, now, I want to intercut some footage of Kelly working on the street. Do you have anything we can use? - Not yet, but I am meeting her and Dwayne tonight at his office. - His office? - A street corner in the Bronx. - What makes you think they'll show? - I had to offer a little incentive. - Well, make sure we get our money's worth. One last thing, I want you to track down a recovered addict that we can plant in the audience. You know, toss in a bone of hope. - Three months? Yeah, no, unfortunately, I need somebody who is clean a little longer than just three months. Yes, of course I understand. (sexy music) But if she's willing to come on. Uh, could you hold on? - You Miriam? - Hi, I'm back. Um. Yeah, so if she's willing to appear on the show, it would be great. - I'm Lana. - Oh, Miriam Reeder. Have a seat. - Thanks. - So did Jimmy explain the segment to you? - Yeah, housewives who strip? (laughs) Your kids? - Uh huh. - Oh, they're really cute, yeah. So Jimmy told me that you're the one who did the shows on body piercing and boyfriends who couldn't get enough? Ah! (laughs) I really loved that one. - Yeah, I'm the resident pervert. - No kiddin'. - Okay, gang, I'm takin' orders. Miriam, what can I get ya? - Uh, boys of the Purple Pussycat. They're always rowdy. And horny. (Lana laughing and snorting) - You got it. You know, for an extra buck, you can upgrade to a combo and get fries and a drink with that. Enh, hee, hee. Diane? - [Diane] You know what, I'm sorry, I don't understand. - What kind of audience do you want for your hooker show, you know? - (laughs) You're telling me I can specify an audience? - Sure. You know, we aim to please and all that, eh? - Yeah, but at Margolis, we just had to take pot luck. - Sadie doesn't like to leave anything to chance. - You got that right. You want college kids? We got sororities and frat houses we go to. You want the mature conservative types? We go to church groups. You want large people? We hang out at the hot dog vendors. You want johns looking to pick up transvestite prostitutes? We head down to 42nd Street. You want Bible-- - Jenny? - What's with her? Jenny? Was it something I said? (Jenny sniffling) - They aired the show I did on battered wives. And one of the guests... - What is it? Jenny, come on, it's okay. What? It's okay. - Her husband saw the show, and he beat her up, and she's in intensive care. And they don't know if she'll make it. (crying) - I'm sorry, come here. I'm sorry. - Jenny. Did you beat up that woman? Of course you didn't. You placed her in a halfway house, but she ran back to her husband, sweetie. So who's responsible for what happened, huh? She is. She knew what he was. But she went back to him anyway, in spite of everything you tried to do for her. The people we deal with are victims, and they will always be victims. The only mistake you made was to get involved emotionally. Come on. Let's tie one on. What do you think? Okay. (sad music) - [Prostitute] Hey, baby. What you want, baby, huh? - Okay, cut. - What do you say we call it quits? We've got enough footage here for a movie. - Yeah. Okay, let me just try and talk to our friend Dwayne one more time. (pulsing music) Dwayne, it's 1:30, where is she? - You're kiddin' me, already? I don't have a. Well, it's probably like I told you. She probably got all tied up in a business meeting. (laughs) - Really? Well, that's what you told me two hours ago. Forget it. We're outta here. - Wait, wait. Wait. I just had an idea. You know something? You don't even really need Kelly. Lemme, lemme introduce you to Constance. Constance. Now, she's freelance, but she has agreed to commission me on this. Turn around, honey. Huh? - Forget it, Dwayne. There's no deal. You either deliver Kelly or the whole thing is off. - Tough chick. Pwew. - I am sorry, but we have a strict policy, Lurleen. No teeth, no talk. Ye, yes, I know. I know, but we can't. As I said, we do have a strict policy. We have standards here at the Howard Grant Show. - Producers of this show have only one job, Diane, and that is to make me happy. Do I look happy? (phone buzzes) I told you, no interruptions. Put her on. I am not interested in sick children, Miriam, yours or anyone else's. I am interested in your show. It is taping tonight at nine, with or without you. Which will it be? - I am going to give you another chance, Diane. I am going to let you take over Miriam's show. - Housewives that strip? - Jeffrey Madden from corporate is paying us a surprise visit tonight, and I want this show to be perfect. Understand? - Yes, Sadie, but I really don't think-- - Get Miriam's book and get on it. - Okay, Teri, you have to help me out here. Miriam has you down as an expert for the stripper show. - Um hmm. It's you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. One of us comes up short a guest or an expert, the other steps in. I've been a guest twice now. This is my first time as an expert. - Fine, but what makes you-- - an expert? I had breast reduction surgery a few years ago, so Miriam thought that I'd be the perfect candidate for-- - Phone, Diane. The phone! - I'm coming. Hello. Yes, this is Diane. Oh hi, yes, of course. Of course, I understand, but how long do you really think you're gonna be able to keep this a secret? Can you hold on? I think I'm losing a guest. - No you're not. Open the prize closet. Offer her an extra day or two and just see. If that doesn't work, throw some money at her, but don't even think about telling me you've lost her. Myra. We need to talk. - Hi, um, you know, I'm thinking that it's probably just stage fright. What could I possibly do to make this a little easier for you? - I want to hear right on, brother. Tell it like it is, girl. You better start talkin' to my hand, 'cause my face just stopped listenin' a half an hour ago to what you all started sayin'. (audience laughing) Okay? I want everyone to say hello to my main man Keith. - [Audience] Hi, Keith. - All right, Keith is gonna help you out. So every time you see my man Keith do this, we expect to hear from you. (audience cheering) Ladies and gentlemen of New York City, without further ado, put your hands and feet together for a warm welcome to the one, the only, the dashing, the daring, compassionate and caring all-around guru of television talk show Howard Grant! (upbeat music) (audience applauding) - Camera two, give me a waister on Howard. Take two. Ready one. Take one. Key Lana. 32, take two. Camera three, tighten up on Howard. Tighten up. Ready one, take one. - A week doesn't go by without one of our competitors staging a show just like this. - We've got a few new wrinkles. Haven't we, Diane? - I better go prep the next guest. (audience applauding) - I bloomed kinda young, you know. And the guys, I mean, they were always like at me, and you know, I figured, you know, when opportunity knocked. I mean, (laughs) hello, why not? (audience applauding) - Why not? - Camera three's out of focus. That operator's history. I want him off the stage now! - Lana, even without knowing your husband, I think we can safely assume he's a very understanding fellow. Let's say hi to Pete. (audience applauding) Thanks for joining us, Pete. - [Man In Audience] You're a lucky guy! - Now, before we go any further, I have to ask. It doesn't bother you seeing your wife take off her clothes in front of all those other men? - She can go right ahead. They can slobber all they want. (audience laughs) 'Cause they're just a bunch of hogs gatherin' at the trough. (audience applauding) I can tell you, this ole boy's the only one that ever gets the slop. Ain't that right, honey? (audience applauding) - And I thought romance was dead. - Listen to this. Tell him how we met, go on. - Well, I guess you could say that Lana here was my birthday present. - Ta-da. - [Pete] A bunch of boys got together, you know. - They hired her to strip at your party? - Actually, it was a little bit more intimate than that. (audience oohs) (Pete laughs) - BJ. (laughs) - There's an idea for a show, housewives who hook. Or have we already done that one? - Intimate. Yes. - I've got something to say to Lana. How can you let him treat you like a piece of meat? - [Audience] Aww! - You're just jealous! I'll tell her. - And you, Howard. I used to admire you, but now you're like all the rest. You demean women. You demean the human race! - Damn, mark that comment right after piece of meat. We'll cut the rest in post. - Lana's husband is completely comfortable with her line of work, but some of our guests perform without their husband's knowledge. (audience groans) - I just know how he's gonna take it. - Um, well, just, you know, relax. I'm sure it'll be fine once you get out there. - Okay. - When we come back, we'll answer the question what happens when the unsuspecting hubby discovers that the little woman moonlights as a stripper? - [Director] 31. (audience applauding) - When we come back. (dramatic music) Let's give a nice hello to Shelley. (audience applauding) - You're gonna be great. Go on, good luck. - Hello, Shelley, welcome to the Howard Grant Show. Now, you're a secretary? - During the day. (audience laughing) - I'm curious. How did you go from taking dictation in an office to taking your clothes off in a bar? - Well, it was my surgery, really. (laughs) Well, you know, it's like when you get a new car. It don't mean much if you can't, you know, show it off a little bit. So when I got my new boobs, I just sorta wanted to share them. (audience cheering) - I've never been on TV before. - Shh, shh. - But your husband doesn't know. - About my boobs? (audience laughing) - No, about your stripping. - Oh. No. (throat clears) No. I wasn't sure how he was gonna take it. - Shall we find out? - [Audience] Yes! (audience applauding) - I've got all my friends and relatives watching. - We've had Shelley's husband in isolation backstage, but now we're gonna ask him to join us. Ladies and gentlemen, let's give Bill a big round of applause. (audience applauding) - You'll be great. Good luck. - [Director] See Bill. Ready two, take two. - Ambush. Ambush. There's outlaws up that canyon, cowboy. - That's it, Tex. You're outta here. - [Howard] Welcome to the Howard Grant Show. - [Jeffrey] Move! - [Howard] We've asked you here because your wife has a secret she wants to share with you. Any idea what it is? - See ya, Jer. - I don't know. (audience chuckles) - I'll give you a hint. Shelley's been moonlighting lately to bring in a little extra cash, hasn't she? (audience laughing) - Yeah, she's been waitressing. The pays good. It pays good too. - That's what she's been telling you. How would you like to know what she's really been doing? - I don't get it. - Why don't we let her show you. Maestro! (audience applauding) (sexy music) - What is he doing? He's not supposed to do that. - That's enough. (Shelley screams) - [Howard] Come on, wait a second. (punch slamming) - Oh God, get Howard out of this! Jimmy! - Oh, this is great! - Yes! - This is what talk's all about. - [Director] If Howard leaves that stage, I will personally murder him! - Uh, I told you we had some new wrinkles. - Come on! - [Director] Camera four, move right in there. Get Howard. - [Security Guard] Let's go. Right now, right now! - Sit down. I'm all right. - [Jimmy] Hey. So what are you gonna do with the money? - What money? - Didn't you know? There's a $500 bonus for any on-the-air fights. Keep up the good work and even Sadie'll have to start watching her back. Hi. (Sadie chuckles) Terrific show. - Mm. - [Jimmy] Well, no rest for the wicked. - Congratulations. You won Madden's heart. I know it's a very small prize, but it matters. It's gotten to you, hasn't it? You feel what, unclean? - This just isn't what I came here to do. - Mm, you know what your trouble is, you're an idealist. You think you can do shows to improve people's lives, but you can't. There's no audience for it. Everything in talk is entertainment. Everybody in the business is a whore. But there is a bright side. We're highly paid whores. (slow music) (machine beeps) - [Diane's Mother] Diane, it's Mom. I just wanted to remind you about Daddy's birthday. Now, the party's at two, so why don't you call and surprise him when everyone's here, okay? We love you. Bye. (machine beeps) - Diane, it's Jenny. Nothing special. I guess (sighs) I just felt like talking. I'll catch you at the office. (hand knocking) - Who is it? - [Jimmy] Diane, it's Jimmy. - Jimmy? (gentle music) - Hi. I was just leaving the studio when-- - It's Kelly. She's in jail. - It was right after we left the apartment. Dwayne, he sees him coming, and he fades away like he was never there. I figured it was the usual roundup, you know? In and out in a couple of hours, but no, it was that cabbie. Oh God. - Could we get some help? Could somebody help us, please! - You get me out of here! - I can't. It took me all day just to get in. Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah, I feel great. - I'm very sorry. I mean, I really wish there was something I could do for you. - There is. You could get me out of here. Mom said you could get me out. - I can't get you out. Kelly, if she said that, she just, she misunderstood, all right? I told her that I could propose a satellite remote. - A what? - Well, I could interview you live in jail while talking to your family on the show. But then, you know, we could go in front of the judge and offer to put you in a treatment program maybe instead of jail time. - Yeah, but what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Ow. (crying) - I don't know. Hang in there, I guess. I don't know what to tell you. - This treatment program, they got methadone? - I don't know. - [Man] Forget it. I'm not gonna let you people play God with this girl. - [Diane] But we're not trying to play God. - [Man] I'm due in court. - Please just hear me out. - Look, you want to help this girl? - Yes. - Then don't humiliate her by putting her on TV. Let nature and the legal system take their course. Let her go cold turkey. It'll give her something to think about next time she thinks about sticking a needle in her arm. - That's just it. We want to put her in a treatment program. - Hey look, do I look like some kind of idiot here? In a couple of days, the assistant DA's gonna show up and he's gonna say Jack, what can we do? And I'm gonna say Mike, the jails are overcrowded, and the only person this girl's ever hurt is herself, so why don't we do everybody a favor, and we'll put her into a treatment program in lieu of jail. Great idea, he says. Nice talkin' to ya. By then, she'll have gone cold turkey. She'll be off the stuff. She'll go in clean, maybe even have some chance of going all the way. And she won't have the memory of going on TV and rubbing her face in her dirt! What are you gonna call this anyway? I was a teenage junkie? - [Diane] The satellite remotes, it's not happening. - [Sadie] Why not? - Well, her public defender's against it and so's the jail. - Bail her out. - What? Wait a minute, Sadie. Wouldn't that be crossing some sort of a line? - You're going soft on me? You crossed a line when you paid off her pimp. You crossed another line when you witnessed that carjacking. Now you're worried about fronting her bail? - I know, it's just that I don't know-- - Diane, if you look at it with a clear head you'll see that there really aren't any lines, just frontiers. You want to succeed in talk, you gotta keep pushing them back. Bail her out. - Okay, okay. It's just that the court's closed now. - Well then tomorrow. And Diane? - Yeah? - You haven't forgotten about the station manager's party, have you? (dial tone humming) - I've always prided myself on being in touch, but the landscape of talk has changed, and you can bet the Howard Grant Show's gonna change too. - [Sadie] Regarding Howard's longevity and the fact that his ratings are rising. - I'm telling you, Sadie, the demographics get younger every day. They don't want Howard. They want Ricki or Howard's son. - Yes, well you know what you have to understand is that our owners are farmers. - Farmers. - Big farmers, but they're still good old boys with good old fashioned values, and I got the-- - Tell me those old fashioned values do include appreciation of the bottom line, don't they? - Yes, sir, they do. And that's my second point. Our big sponsors are getting cold feet and starting to pull out. - Uh huh, and for every one that pulls out, there are two or three others standing in line waiting to step in. - Everything's always threatening to fall apart, but, at the last minute, you manage to pull it out of the toilet. It's a constant rush. I can't wait until I become a producer. The critics can say what they want, but we're dealing with stuff the average Joe cares about. Bosnia, the bond market? They don't care about that stuff. They care about the stuff that impacts them, the stuff talk deals with. - Right. - And Sadie, woo. She's tough, but you know what? You gotta be. And she cares too. When she saw that thing upset Jenny the other day, she took care of her. I tell ya, I'm right where I want to be. Right in the thick of it. - Jimmy, I'm sorry can you excuse me? I just want to go talk to Jenny for a minute. - Sure. - Jenny! - [Man] Whoa, what's the matter with you? - Sorry, I'm sorry. - Oh, don't be, I'm grateful. - You're grateful? - Yes, for the opportunity to meet such a lovely young woman. I'm Mark Holston. - Diane Shepherd. - Oh, you're Diane. Oh, I understand Sadie has great hopes for you. - Oh, no, I mean, I'm new. I'm just sort of feeling my way through, you know. - Well, we're soul mates then. - Oh no, I mean, you're a lawyer, and you don't go through... Oh. - Diane, have you been spying on me? - No, no. I just. Well, of course, I know who you are. I mean, I know about the case that you won, and-- - And? - (laugh) I just, I know about you and Sadie. - Ah, then you have been spying on me. - No. No, no. - It's okay. Because we're soul mates, I forgive you. You know, I think you and I should get together for dinner. Then you could tell me all about yourself. I could tell you all about myself, and then you could give up your career as a spy. - (laughs) That's sweet. I don't think Sadie would like that. - Well, Sadie doesn't have to know. - Oh now, I couldn't do that, Mark. - Oh sure you could. You know, people do it all the time. - Mark. - Sadie. - We have to talk. - You'll excuse me, won't you? - Oh yes. (glass tinkling) - Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Jenny. We've got a little program planned, so if you'll gather around the monitors, we'll get started. Maestro, if you will. - Where's Sadie? - Oh, I, I'm not sure. I just saw her-- - Find her. She's up right after the clips. - [Announcer] For 15 years now, America has trusted Howard Grant to bring it the most compelling programming in talk TV. Whether the issue is race or relationships, the politics of this nation. - [Sadie] You can't talk yourself out of this. - Sadie? - [Mark] Don't you think you're overreacting? - [Sadie] I had to stand there and listen politely while that tramp bragged about sleeping with you. - [Mark] It meant nothing, all right. It was just sex. - [Sadie] How many of these sweet little nothings have you got, Mark? A station manager here, a legal secretary there. - [Mark] Sadie, I'm telling you. - [Sadie] No! I am telling you, Mark. You can forget about us, if there ever was an us. And you can forget about the show too, Because as of this moment, you are history! - [Mark] You know, you were always history, Sadie, old, dusty and dull. - [Announcer] Have watched their ratings plummet in the course of the last few years. Howard's ratings among women 18 to 49 have actually risen during the same period of time. The Howard Grant Show, it simply doesn't get any better than this. - All right, everyone, sit down. I'm all right. - [Announcer] Howard Grant, all right with America. (people clapping) - Yeah! - She was safe in jail, from a pimp, from a habit, from herself. Now you just spent $8,000 to put her at risk again! - No, no, no, no, I promise you, she's gonna be safe with us. We're gonna place her in a-- - You're gonna place her back in the same hell she just left! Now, that is not bail money! That is blood money! (gentle music) - What's this? - It's my apartment. The show usually provides the guests with a hotel room. I thought you'd be more comfortable here. - What's the matter, you figure I'm gonna run off or somethin'? - [Diane] Look, they told me to keep an eye on you, okay? I could've put you in a hotel room with a body guard, all right? - Whatever. Wow. Nice place. - Oh, um, thanks. It's just a sublet. Um, listen, make yourself at home, okay? I just, um, I gotta make a phone call. Happy birthday, Daddy! Oh yeah, I know. I'm sorry I missed your party. He what? (laughs) I don't believe it. In front of everybody? I can't believe I missed that. Oh, that is so embarrassing! Um, you know what? I have someone here, so I just called to wish you a happy birthday and tell you that I love you very, very much. Yes. Yes, I'll be careful. I love you too. Bye. - He sounds like a nice guy or something. - Yeah, yeah, he is. - Yeah well, I don't believe in nice guys. I never met one that didn't want somethin'. - You know, not everybody is out for themselves. - Yeah? Yeah well, what about you, huh? You're being all nicey nice, but it isn't real. You just want something. You're just like, like those johns that tell me how pretty I am and wonder what a girl like me is doing out on the street. - No. I mean, yeah, I want you on the show, but I also care about what happens to you. - N-n-n-n-no, everybody's the same, all right? I go on the show tomorrow. I do my little act. Your boss pats you on the back, and it's on to the next one. Goodbye, Kelly. Hello, whoever. Have you got something to eat? I'm starvin'. I mean, it's always like this when I come down. I can never get enough to eat. - So you've been clean before? - Um hmm. When I was pregnant, I went cold turkey. I didn't want my kid born a junkie. Have you seen her picture? - Yeah. - She's cute, isn't she? - She's beautiful. So um, why, why did you go back to the drugs? I mean, how could you let your little girl go like that? - What was I gonna do for her? You know me a junkie, no job, no education, no home. What was I gonna do for her? - It doesn't have to be that way. - Yes, it does. It does have to be that way. - No, no, it doesn't. You could help yourself. You could go to a treatment program. You could go to school-- - Yeah, what do you know about it? You've never had that needle in your arm. We're sitting here talking about my kid, my child, all right. And what am I thinking about? I'm thinking about that needle. I'm thinking about how just a spoonful of that white sugar will make all of this go away. See, I don't want to care. I don't want to care about anything. - But you do. I know that you do. So do I. - Hello. Have you suffered brain death? Of course we're going ahead. - Sadie, I am not suggesting that we shouldn't. I'm just saying that she seems a little fragile, you know. I'm concerned about what could happen to her afterwards. - She's going into a rehab program. - Or she could end up back on the streets. - Uh, that's exactly where you found her. Look, the bottom line, I don't care what happens to her and neither should you. You book 'em, interview 'em, get rid of 'em. Bing, bang, boom. - Jenny? Jenny, hi. Wait a second, I, I've been really worried about you, you know? - [Jenny] I'm fine. - Oh, I. I just, I've been feeling like I let you down the other day. - I'm fine, really. Sadie was right. It was bound to happen anyways. It was just a mistake to get so emotionally involved. I gotta run. I'll catch you later, okay? - So I said to him, "Ted don't you have any pride? "How could you ride my shirt tails like this?" - [Sadie] Where's the kid, Diane? I don't see any sign of her here. - Right, I told you, the record was sealed. - And I told you there was a way around that. - Look, Sadie, I thought about it, and I really don't think we should subject Kelly to that kind of emotional-- - I have already briefed Howard on this one. Could we read through it? - As many of you know, I have for years tried to focus attention on the plague of drugs devastating the youth of our nation. It is a plague with many symptoms: AIDS, violent crime, prostitution. - Pick up the pace, Howard, and give me a pause before prostitution. - As many of you know, I have for years tried to focus attention on the plague of drugs devastating the youth. - [Announcer] The Howard Grant Show! (audience applauding) - Hi. You all right? - Got anymore of those candy bars? - (laughs) All right, I'll talk to Jimmy. You sure you're up to this? - What kind of question is that? Like I'm gonna back out now? And then what? Go back to jail? I'm cool. You just take care of those candy bars, all right? - As many of you know, I have for years now tried to focus attention on the plague of drugs devastating the youth of our nation. It is a plague with many symptoms: AIDS, violent crime, prostitution. In fact, a shockingly high percentage of the prostitutes on our streets are there simply to feed their habit. Not long ago, the mother of one such girl wrote me a letter. Dear Howard, I am writing to you because I don't know where else to turn. - Every day, my daughter breaks my heart. She's only 19, but her life is already over. She is a drug-addicted prostitute and the mother of a two-year-old girl. - [Howard] Like so many of our young people today, Kelly started out with the world all before her. Then heroine changed her life. Did you shoot up before this interview? - [Kelly] Good stuff, actually. - [Howard] Why, Kelly? - [Kelly] Look around you. - [Howard] Kelly plies her trade from a corner in the Bronx. - [Kelly] Hey, baby, you lookin' for some company? - [Howard] She feeds her habit here at a nearby crack house. - [Man] What you need? Whatever ails you, I got the cure. - [Howard] She has been beaten, intimidated, raped, but nothing slakes her thirst. Nothing keeps her from coming back. Kelly and her boyfriend, Dwayne, have come home not to see her family but to scavenge money for drugs. - [Jeri] Oh yeah? Well, how about you? Whose house did she come to to shoot up? - Well, where was she gonna go? To you and one of your boyfriends? - Why not? (audience murmurs) - [Howard] Why are you here now? - I needed some money. - [Howard] Your family gives you money for drugs? - [Kelly] No, I take it. - [Howard] How do you feel about that? What about prostitution? How does that make you feel? (sad music) Do you ever feel-- - Why do you keep on asking me how I feel? I don't, I don't feel anything. I. - You talk to these girls with such understanding, and you treat them like human beings instead of garbage that belongs in the gutter, so I know (sighs) you will hear me too. Please, Howard. Please, Howard, help me save my daughter. Please stop the pain. (Jeri crying) - Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Kelly. (audience applauding) Kelly, after seeing yourself like that, how does it make you feel? - Ashamed. - But you're drug free now? - Yes. (audience applauding) - How did she get started? - How did you get started? - Um. I knew this girl at school, and um, it was a real rush at first, you know? But now it's not. It's work. It's hard work. You lie, you cheat, you steal, you turn tricks, you do whatever. - And you're gonna stay clean? - I'm gonna try. (audience applauding) - When we come back, we'll talk with two people who are determined to help Kelly keep that vow. (audience applauding) - This girl is a gold mine. You wanted to give up our claim? (upbeat music) - Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jeri and Brenda. (audience applauding) Have a seat, and welcome to the Howard Grant Show. What did you do to try to help Kelly? - We tried detox. We tried to get her into a treatment program, but. I even tried locking her in her room. - She's a beautiful girl when she's clean, but, you know, when she's high she steals. She steals from me and from Jeri, and she brings these terrible people into our homes. - Kelly, how does that make you feel, knowing that you put your family through that? - Like garbage. But when you're high, you just don't care. - But I cared. I never stopped caring about you. (Jeri crying) - You have a child. - [Kelly] She's in foster care, but she's clean. I went off the stuff when I found out I was pregnant. - You had her for two months, and then you went back on the drugs again. - Yeah, but I loved her. I still love her. - Of course you do, Kelly. I'm just trying to understand here. - You think I like knowing that she calls someone else mom? I just wasn't strong enough. I just wasn't strong enough. - Kelly, would you like to see Joey? Would you like to see your little girl again? - Yeah. - Ladies and gentlemen, we've arranged a little surprise for Kelly. Joey's adoptive parents have brought her here to see Kelly. So now let's please welcome Lee, Kathleen and Joey. - What? Adoptive parents? She's in foster care, Mom! (dramatic music) (audience applauding) - Now, bear in mind, Joey doesn't know that Kelly is her biological mother. She's been told she's here to meet her aunt, so we're depending on your discretion, audience. At two, Joey is a bright, lively child with no sign of addiction. And now, let's introduce Joey to Kelly. Kathleen? (Joey crying) - Joey, it's okay. It's okay. It's all right. Oh, it's okay. - She isn't very good with strangers. - She's probably just upset by the crowd. I'm sure, in time, she'll come round. Unfortunately, we're out of time. But before we go, let me just say that what you have seen here today is a cautionary tale, but one that may yet end happily. Lee and Kathleen have told us that if Kelly stays clean and off the streets, they'll consider letting her visit Joey from time to time. Well, until tomorrow, goodbye and God bless. (audience applauding) - [Diane] Why wasn't I told? - You were getting cold feet, so I put Jimmy on it. He's not hamstrung by scruples. - Sadie, they're people, you know! They're not puppets! - That is where you're wrong, Diane. The are nothing but puppets. Puppets jerked around by their pathetic desires. - I'm gonna go check on her. - Hey, Diane, great show. When I grow up, I want to be just like you. - Where's Kelly? - You know that old saying in talk. In in a limo, out in a taxi. I sent her home. - What? (whistle blowing) Oh, Kelly! Kelly! What happened? - We, uh, we had words. - She guessed it. - That I agreed to the adoption. I didn't want to, but I couldn't take care of her myself. Other foster homes were terrible. - Okay, okay, just tell me, where did she go? - We don't know. She just grabbed that taxi that the nice young man just hailed for us. (dramatic music) - Sure, I know her. But I ain't seen her in a couple of weeks. What can I say? That's how it is. See ya, college girl. Hey, (speaking in foreign language) - Kelly Lonigan. Look, I know she comes here all the time. - You want information, dial zero. You want a lift, come talk to me. - Well, maybe, maybe you can relieve my ignorance, huh? - I ain't seen her. (slow music) - [Kelly] I went off the stuff when I found out I was pregnant. - [Howard] And then you went back on the drugs? - [Kelly] (crying) Yeah, but I loved her. I still love her. - [Howard] Of course you do, Kelly. I'm just trying to understand here. - [Kelly] Do you think I like knowing that she calls someone else mom? I just wasn't strong enough. I just wasn't strong enough. - Would you like to see Joey? Would you like to see your little girl? Ladies and gentlemen, we've arranged a little surprise for Kelly. Joey's adoptive parents have brought her here to see Kelly. - What? - Please welcome Lee, Kathleen and Joey. (audience applauding) Now, bear in mind, Joey doesn't know that Kelly is her biological mother. She's been told she's here to meet her aunt, so we're depending on your discretion, audience. At two, Joey is a bright, lively child with no sign of addiction. And now, let's introduce Joey to Kelly. Kathleen? (Joey crying) (dramatic music) - It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. - She's not very good with strangers. (spoon clattering) - [Howard] She's probably just upset by the crowd. I'm sure in time, she'll come round. Unfortunately, we are out of time. (phone rings) - Hello. (slow music) - Yes, I ordered it, for the hallway outside the stage. Does it look like it belongs in an office? Yeah, well, I am not interested in union regulations. I am interested in getting the damn thing out of my office! - Diane. We just heard. I'm so sorry. - Ugh, he put me on hold. We did not kill that girl, Diane. - I've heard the speech, Sadie. - She killed herself, and she would've done it if she'd never heard of you or the Howard Grant Show. - Maybe. - We, we deal with people who are dysfunctional, and there is nothing that anyone can do for them. So let it go. - I already have. I'm quitting. - What? - I'm quitting. - I didn't hear that. I refuse to hear that. - Well, I guess you'll just have to be surprised when I don't show up for work tomorrow. - [Sadie] Uh ha, you want more money. - I don't want any more money, Sadie. I just, I don't want any more. - How much? Please, who is it? Geraldo? I'll double the offer. Jeffrey, I didn't expect you. - Are we, uh, losing that girl? - Of course not. She's just negotiating. - Unlike your ex-boyfriend. - [Sadie] What's this? - That's a $12 million lawsuit for wrongful termination. - He couldn't possibly-- - I hope not, Sadie, for your sake, because I'm not prepared to pay $12 million for an executive producer. (sad music) - [Officiant] And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. - Amen. I'm going back to news. It's where I started, and it's where I belong. - But you're doing such wonderful work with Howard. We'll never forget what you did for us and for Kelly. - Never. You and Howard were the only ones who cared. You were the only ones that even noticed that she left us. - You spoke with Howard? - Yes, he called to offer his condolences, and he invited us to join him on the show again. He said maybe we could help some other girl in Kelly's situation. I'm so sorry you won't be there. Thank you. You treated Kelly like a human being. (sad music) (audience applauding) - Dwayne under control? - Jeri, Brenda, thanks for coming. - Oh yeah, I've Jimmy watching him. - I am so very, very sorry. Before we begin, I'd like to share something with you. You see, the reason I feel so deeply about Kelly's fate is that I nearly lost my son, Ted, to drugs some years ago. - What is he doing? - Like - I believe it's called ad libbing. - so many other parents, my wife and I ignored the early warning signs, rationalizing Ted's behavior - What is that going to do to Ted? - As nothing more than adolescent - Who cares? - rebellion. - It's great theater. - After all, it's a teenager's - You're right. - job to be selfish, - It doesn't get any better than this. - withdrawn - Uh uh. - [Howard] and secretive. By the time we woke up, Ted had almost died from an overdose. Fortunately, Ted's story had a happier ending than Kelly's. He's clean, for now. But it will always be day to day. But it could just as easily. (upbeat music) (gentle music) (Multicom Jingle)
