I'M IN HERE! HONESTLY, KAY, IF I LIVE TO BE 100, I'LL NEVER GET USED TO YOUR 365-DEGREE TURNS! OH, THANKS FOR COMING, MOTHER. YOU SURE YOU WANT TO OPEN THIS PLACE AGAIN? POSITIVE. IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS. THREEYEARS! WHATEVER, IT'S A BIG DECISION. IT COULD BE QUITE A SHOCK. IT'S JUST A HOUSE, MOTHER! IT'S MORE THAN THAT! IT'S A PART OF YOUR LIFE! THAT PART IS OVER WITH. YOU SUDDENLY DECIDE AFTER THIS WHAT'S-HIS-NAME HAS BEEN CHASING YOU FOR TWO YEARS TO MARRY THAT GRAVEDIGGER. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME IS RUPERT! HE'S AN EGYPTOLOGIST! I DON'T CARE WHAT HE SAYS HE IS. HE LOOKS IN THE GROUND FOR DEAD PEOPLE. FOR GOD'S SAKE, BE CAREFUL WITH THIS! WORK'S PRICELESS! WATCH THAT CORNER. DOING FINE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS. STUFF'S BEEN IN EGYPT FOR 4,000 YEARS, IT ARRIVES THE WEEK I'M SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED. COULDN'T HAVE BEEN PLANNED BETTER. ARE YOU NERVOUS? SURE I AM. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF GETTING MARRIED, TO BE NERVOUS. I'M ALSO VERY EXCITED, THOUGH. IN MY OFFICE. AND THIS ONE, TOO, PLEASE. YOU GOT IT. ASK ME, YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. MARRIAGE IS THE PITS. YOU WERE A PRIEST. IS THAT WHAT YOU TOLD PEOPLE? NO, THAT'S WHAT THEY USED TO TELL ME. KAY AND I ARE VERY MUCH IN LOVE. WE'RE TWO INTELLIGENT, COMPATIBLE ADULTS, WE LIKE THE SAME THINGS-- LIKING THE SAME THINGS DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT MATTERS IS SPENDING MONEY ON THE SAME THINGS. YOU PROBABLY WERE A CYNICAL PRIEST. I GOT TO MEET KAY. THIS HOUSE, THIS MARRIAGE-- I HOPE IT WON'T END UP LIKE THOSE TURTLES. WHAT TURTLES? THOSE TURTLES YOU'D ALWAYS CONVINCE YOUR FATHER TO BUY YOU. THAT SAME IMPULSE IS AT WORK. BUT WHO ENDED UP FEEDING THEM THOSE SMELLY OLD FLIES? YOU DID. YES. YOU LOST INTEREST RIGHT AWAY. YOU WON'T FEED MY HUSBAND SMELLY OLD FLIES. I SHOULD HOPE NOT. AS HIS WIFE, THAT'LL BE YOUR JOB. I'VE BEEN IN LIMBO THREE YEARS, SINCE JOLLY DIED. I JUST WANT TO START TO LIVE AGAIN. I KNOW, DARLING, BUT WHY IN THIS HOUSE? BECAUSE IT'S MY HOUSE AND I LOVE IT! WHAT DOES RUPERT SAY TO THAT? I HAVEN'T TOLD HIM YET. WHAT? I HAVEN'T TOLD HIM YET, BUT I WILL. I'M SURE WE'LL BOTH LIVE HERE VERY HAPPILY. I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY, DEAR. YOU KNOW THAT. IT'S JUST THAT, AS YOUR MOTHER, I FEEL IT'S MY DUTY TO POINT OUT ALL THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THE SITUATION. THANKS, MOTHER. [WIND CHIMES] [VOICES] NICE TRY. EMILY, HAVE YOU SEEN JOLLY? HE GOT A CAB RIGHT BEHIND MINE. [KNOCK ON DOOR] HELLO? ANYBODY HOME? EMILY? [KNOCK KNOCK] HELLO? HELLO? EMILY! AHH! HI. HELLO. THANKS FOR COMING. I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY. THE MAGAZINE CAN LIVE WITHOUT ME AN AFTERNOON. I BROUGHT THE PROOFS OF YOUR CHELSEA ARTICLE. DID YOU LIKE IT? YES. GOOD. I LOVE THIS PLACE. I'D FORGOTTEN HOW ELEGANT IT WAS. HOW ELEGANT IT IS. IS.

I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING HAL PRINCE AND STEPHEN SONDHEIM FOR NOT PRODUCING A PLAY ON BROADWAY THIS YEAR AND, OF COURSE, THE IMPLACABLE JENNY, STAGE MANAGERESS WITHOUT PEER. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, INCLUDING HOLDING MY HAND, TELLING ME MY ZIPPER WAS OPEN. FINALLY, THE ONE PERSON WITHOUT WHOM I COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH ANY OF IT, MY DARLING KAY, THE NIGHT IS YOURS, AND I LOVE YOU. WAS THIS ALWAYS HERE? WHAT? THIS WALL, WAS IT ALWAYS HERE? YES, MOTHER, IT WAS ALWAYS THERE. WELL, I DON'T REMEMBER IT. IT WAS ALWAYS KIND OF FLAT LIKE THAT AND HELD THE BUILDING UP. IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME KIND OF WORK TO MAKE THIS PLACE WHAT IT WAS. NO. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WHAT IT WAS. I'M GOING TO CHANGE EVERYTHING, TOP TO BOTTOM-- NEW WALLPAPER, NEW FURNITURE--EVERYTHING! KAY? WHAT? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE. I JUST HAVE TO GET MY BEARINGS. COME ON, SHAKESPEARE. IT'S GREAT THAT SHE'S DECIDED TO FACE THIS PLACE, TO START DOING THINGS AGAIN. BUT WHY NOT START WITH A SIMPLER HOBBY, LIKE NEEDLEPOINT OR--OR ANALYSIS? JOLLY... [TAP-DANCING] [WIND CHIMES] IS RUPERT HERE YET? NO, NOT YET! HE SAID HE'D BE HERE AT 4:00. HE'S PLAYING WITH THOSE DEAD ARABS. MOTHER, THAT'S HIS JOB. PLEASE TRY TO BE TOLERANT OF HIM. AH, HE'S SUCH A NERD. HE'S NOT A NERD. WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT WORD? IT CAME OUT WHEN I MET HIM, JUST LIKE THAT. I LIKE RUPERT. YOUMARRY HIM. RUPERT IS A FINE MAN. WE'RE GOING TO BE MARRIED. WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE FOUND ANOTHER MAN LIKE JOLLY? MOTHER, PLEASE DON'T START THIS AGAIN! HE WAS SO HANDSOME AND--AND CHARMING AND-- DEAD. AND HE LOVED THIS HOUSE. HE DID NOT, MOTHER. HE HARDLY NOTICED IT. HOME TO JOLLY WAS ROOM SERVICE IN ANY HOTEL IN ANY TOWN WITH A THEATER. CHARLOTTE, DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT SCRAPE TOGETHER A CUP OF INSTANT COFFEE? WHY NOT?

WH--HERE IN THE HOUSE? WHY NOT? IT'S OUR HOUSE. ANOTHER SNAP DECISION. I THINK IT'S A FABULOUS IDEA. [WHISTLE] WHAT ABOUT THE CLUB? CANCEL. CAN'T. THEY WENT TO ALL THIS TROUBLE FITTING US IN ON SHORT NOTICE. IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE FOR A WEDDING. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. WHAT DO YOU SAY? I THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE. LOOSEN UP! PLEASE.

YOU COULD HAVE THE THIRD FLOOR AND REHEARSAL HALL FOR YOUR RESEARCH. I COULD HAVE THE SECOND FLOOR AND STUDY FOR A WORK AREA, AND I COULD WRITE MORE ARTICLES FOR EMILY'S MAGAZINE.

YOU CAN START ANY WAY YOU LIKE-- ALPHABETICALLY, IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE. THERE WAS JANINE. SWEET LITTLE JANINE? SHE WAS JUST A CHILD. NO, SHE WASN'T. SHE WASN'T OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE A WORKING PERMIT. I NEVER ASKED. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. KAY, STOP LYING TO YOURSELF. YOU KNEW ABOUT HIS REPUTATION BEFORE YOU MARRIED HIM. IT WENT AHEAD OF HIM LIKE A PARADE. PARADE? DID YOU HONESTLY THINK MARRIAGE WOULD CHANGE HIM? YES, OF COURSE I DID! ALL RIGHT, THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I HAD THIS FEELING INSIDE, BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

I HOPE WHAT EMILY SAID UP THERE DIDN'T CONFUSE YOU. CONFUSE ME? WHY, NO. I WAS CONFUSED ON MY OWN. WE DID HAVE A GREAT LIFE TOGETHER. YES, WE DID. I'LL HAVE TO REMOVE YOU WITH THE POWER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU USE, JUST GET ME THE HELL OUT OF HERE. [RUFF! RUFF! RUFF!] I GOT HIM! HE'S DOWNSTAIRS. HE'S IN HERE. THE SPIRIT? HE'S IN THE DOG. THE DOG? OF COURSE. THAT'S WHY HE'S HATED ME SO MUCH. GOOD LUCK. I'M LEAVING. YOU'RE LEAVING? [RUFF!] DAMN IT! NOW I'M THE BAD GUY. YOU DON'T LIKE THAT, HUH? NO. LEADING MAN, THAT'S MORE MY STYLE. I'M CASTING THIS ONE. YOU'VE SWITCHED ME TO PLAYING THE HEAVY. I HAVEN'T SWITCHED YOU TO ANYTHING. BUT FOR THREE YEARS, I WAS THE HERO. YES, YOU WERE BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I COULD SEE. ALL I COULD REMEMBER ABOUT YOU WERE THE GOOD THINGS. SUDDENLY YOU'VE COME FACE TO FACE WITH MY SMALL WEAKNESSES. SMALL WEAKNESSES? YOU CALL BELONGING TO THE AFFAIR OF THE MONTH CLUB A SMALL WEAKNESS? YOU NOW SEE ME AS THE GUY I REALLY WAS, HARDLY PERFECT AND SOMETIMES A STINKER, BUT PRETTY MUCH LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. NO BLACK HAT, NO WHITE HAT. I WAS, UM... JOLLY. AH, JOLLY. RUPERT... RUPERT IS RUPERT. AND A WONDERFUL GUY? YES, HE'S A WONDERFUL GUY. HE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DANCE... POSSIBLY NEVER WILL.

THAT'S FINE WITH ME. I'LL GO. WAIT A MINUTE. I DON'T TRUST THIS. YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE THAT'S WHY YOU CAME. WHY? TO HELP ME, TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND THINGS. BE CAREFUL, KAY. YOU'LL ACCUSE ME OF DOING SOMETHING UNSELFISH, AND I DO HAVE A REPUTATION TO CONSIDER. OH, JOLLY, THAT WOULD BE JUST LIKE YOU, TYPICAL! TURN THIS INTO A GRAND GESTURE. I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE YOU CAME HERE TO HELP ME GET YOU OFF MY MIND, RIGHT? GOOD LUCK. WAIT. YOU CAN'T GO. I'M RIGHT, AREN'T I? DARLING, HAVE A WONDERFUL MARRIAGE. YOU DESERVE IT. I DO? KISS ME GOODBYE. [KNOCK ON DOOR] KAY, ARE YOU IN THERE? JOLLY. [RUFF! RUFF!] MOTHER. OH, MOTHER! WHAT? I'M SO HAPPY. WHERE'S RUPERT? I SAW HIM CHASING THE DOG UPSTAIRS. EMILY. EVERYTHING'S ALL FIXED UP. GET EVERYONE READY FOR THE REHEARSAL. OK, PAL, OK. MAYBE I CAN'T DANCE LIKE YOU, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE MARKET ON PASSION CORNERED. I HAPPEN TO LOVE THAT WOMAN. I'M MARRYING HER TOMORROW BECAUSE I LOVE HER! FURTHERMORE, I WANT YOU OUT OF OUR LIVES. I WANT YOU OUT BECAUSE I'M SICK OF YOUR INNUENDO AND YOUR MEDDLING IN OUR AFFAIRS... EVEN IF YOU DID LOVE HER. NOW, I'M GOING TO MARRY HER, AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER WORD FROM YOU. YOU GOT THAT? AAH! ADVANCE AND BEGONE! Charlotte: IT'S EDGAR. I'LL KILL HIM. SOMETHING'S WRONG. EMILY? WATCH OUT!
