I would've thought you'd know. - That's Isidore of Seville. Patron Saint of Computers and Computer Geeks everywhere. - You certainly fit the bill. - Maybe I should get you one. We'll have a matching set. - Please, I'm no geek! - Yeah, right! Why? Just 'cause you look as hot as you do and you don't live in your parents' basement? Stop! - Besides... what's wrong with being a geek? - Nothing. It's one of the reasons I love you so much. What's wrong? - Nothing. Just thinking about my meeting I have tomorrow. - Well, why don't you spend less time worrying about that and spend a little more time worrying about me? Josh? Are you coming back to bed? - Yeah, babe. I'm just finishing something for work, OK? I'll be right there. - Are you going already? - Yeah, I got that meeting. - Will I still see you for dinner? - I promise. Yeah. No, it's done. I'm on my way. Where are you now? But that's not what we agreed to. You said... Say that again. No. No, there's no problem at all. We'll be there. Josh! JOSH! Ms. Turner? - Mr. Brobin said you'd be gone all week. - Yes, I figured 4 days without me was all you could handle. - I just wasn't expecting... I mean, are you OK? - I'm fine. Did you reschedule with the development team? - I've got it pencilled in for next Thursday, but I can move it back-- - No, Thursday's perfect. And the outline from the testing team? - It will be on your desk by the end of the day. - Great. What am I forgetting? - Sorry? - There was something else I was supposed to handle. - Um... I think it's all covered. - No, check my schedule. There was something else. I'm sure of it. - Yeah, you wanted me to clear an afternoon this week so you could... s-so you could buy Josh a birthday present. I'm sorry. - No, it's... It's fine. - I can always push those test reports back a couple of days if you need time. - Karl, I realize it's because you care, but I'm OK. Anything else? - The Atlantic Ridge Bank people just came. Should I put them in the boardroom? - Yes, please do. Thank you. - Not interrupting, am I? - Mr. Brobin. - Karl, would you let them know we'll be in in just in a minute? - Yeah. - Thanks. - So? - So... You're here. - I have work to do and this is my office. Where else should I be? - You didn't have to rush back, Abby. - What I need is to do stuff, to work. Get my mind off of things. I was going crazy at home. And besides, I wasn't gonna miss today. - Do the police know anything yet? - Ongoing investigation. They'll keep me posted. Blah, blah... You know, Abby, look, this meeting, these guys... - Michael, stop worrying! - OK. Not worried! Hey, these guys, despite whatever they say, they need a new system. Now, Neumann's a good guy. I met him a couple of years ago when I did a lecture. - You gave a lecture? Where? - At the university downtown, thank you! Give him straight answers. You're gonna be fine. You got this? - Just watch me. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Kenneth Kelby, Oswald Neumann, this is Abigail Turner. Abby has been our lead designer for the past 4 years, and she is at the top of her field and ForSecure is her baby. And I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that ForSecure is the cutting edge of security technology. I've asked Abby to come down and walk us through it. Abby? - Thank you. - Shall we get started, gentleman? 24-hour-a-day trading. Nearly $4 billion in daily turnover. The foreign-exchange market in today's digital age is enormous. And so that makes it a target. Viruses, hackers, Trojans, worms, thieves... Quite simply put, gentlemen, there are people trying to steal your money. And make no mistake, they have the means to do it. What we offer here at Custodis is the ultimate in protection. It's the pinnacle of foreign-exchange security. We call it ForSecure. ForSecure is a unique, centralized online software security system designed specifically to protect global forex transactions. - Sorry to interrupt you, Ms. Turner, but I'm fairly certain that we've already got a security system in place. Not like this one. - After you. - Thanks. Well, I'll say, what I've seen so far has me impressed. - I'm not so sure your colleague shares the same opinion. - Well, it's a good thing they leave the banking to the bankers and the IT to the IT department, right? - Maybe that's why Abby tries to keep me out of these meetings! - So is this... - The mainframe, yes. - The mainframe. Do you think I could... - Yes, absolutely. After you, Abby. The fastest processors and the most powerful computer. Wow, very impressive. We think so. - Well, I'm glad you enjoyed the presentation. - I did. - After you. And do you have all the specs you need on the ForSecure system? - I do. - Good. - But listen, Mr. Brobin, I don't think I can give you an answer right away. But I'll take this back to my people. And if they like ForSecure as much as I do, we'll be in touch. - I look forward to hearing from you then. - Same here. - Thank you both for your time. - Sure. - Ms. Turner... it was a real pleasure meeting you. - Yes, feeling's mutual. - Take care. - You too. - You nailed it! - You think so? I feel like I could have given more detail-- - You kidding? They loved you. Look, I just wanted to say, I know how hard it must be for you to be here with everything that's been going on. But I'm very glad you were. Thanks. - Ms. Turner? There are 2 people here to see you. - Who are they? The FBI. You know this man? - That's Josh. - His real name is Jarod. Jarod Leary. - I'm sorry? I don't understand. - Leary's name is on a list that we monitor. His murder raised a flag. The FBI took over the investigation. - A list? What kind of list? - A list of known computer hackers. - What? - How long have you two been involved... romantically? - Um... A little under a year. I'm sorry, can you please explain to me what's going on here? - Six years ago, we convicted Leary of computer fraud and grand larceny. He approached females in high-ranking positions at a couple of banks. Seduced them to get the access he needed to hack their computer system. He stole a lot of money. Two years ago, he was out on parole and disappeared. - Then, Josh Lawson popped up. - So what are you saying? - We think he was at it again. Look, I know this is difficult for you. - The Josh I knew-- - Wasn't real, Ms. Turner. - So you're saying that this guy targeted Custodis? - It would make sense. - You're better than a bank, right? - Of course. Our software protects a lot of banks and even more money. So my company's security's been breached? - We can't say for certain. - Wait, but why does any of this matter now? - We've reason to believe he was working with someone who's still out there, who likely murdered him, who may consider you a target. - A target? - If Leary thought you were key to whatever he was planning. - Then whoever killed Leary would be thinking the same thing. - Ms. Turner, was Leary ever here in the office? Yeah... to... to meet me for lunch. - OK. Did he have any access to your passwords? - No, of course not. No. - What about your personal computer? Did you guys ever see him use it? - No. - I'd like to look at it. If Jarod was using it, then maybe he left some clue. - I can't allow you to do that. - Excuse me? - The material on there is proprietary. It belongs to Custodis. So if you wanna see that laptop, you're gonna have to go through the legal department. - We can get a warrant for your computer, Ms. Turner. - Then get a warrant. - No, wait, Ms. Turner, we're not the enemy here. - I realize that. But you walk in here and you tell me that my boyfriend, who was murdered, is a stranger and a criminal. How did you expect me to react to that? - I would have thought you'd wanna know the truth. - So Josh had a past. Fine. What if that's all it was and he was trying to start over? - You don't have to talk. - I hope you're right. But the truth is, you may be in danger. You want to take that chance? - She's been through a great deal. And I think it's best if we all had this conversation another time, all right? - Well, I guess we're done here then. Thank you both for your time. Ms. Turner, in case you remember anything else. We'll see you soon with that warrant. - What just happened? - All right, Abby, look. - Michael, I'm so sorry. I had no idea that Josh-- - It's OK. - I would never, ever compromise this company's security. - I trust you completely, Abby. Now, why don't we just talk about this? - Thank you, but I should go. - Well, where are you going? - Michael, our job is security. And given what the FBI just told us about Josh-- Jarod-- using me to infiltrate our system, I shouldn't be here. - No, Abby, wait a minute. Come back here. All right, Abby, look, what was all that "legal department" stuff about? - I was buying time. - Time for what? Abby, where are you going? - I need to go through that laptop. If Jarod did have an accomplice, someone might have access to the system. So I need to get to work, and I obviously can't do it here. - What are you gonna find? - I have no idea. I'd like to have a look at it before the FBI does. - Abby... be careful. I mean, we're not just dealing with a regular hacker here. Whoever did this has proven they're willing to commit murder. - I know. OK, Josh, Jarod... whoever you are. OK... Empty. He erased the log. All right, well... it's gonna take a lot more than that to hide from me. What? How did I get an account with $10 million in it? OK, here we go. Birthday... I don't even know your real birthday. My birthday? Wishful thinking, I guess. Isidore... "Yes, like a charm." "Yeah, to give you your money." "I'm a friend of Jarod's." "This is my computer." "Jarod's dead." "Murdered." "Can we talk?" Thank you so much, Michael, for meeting me. - It's OK. Don't worry about it. So what have you found? - Someone's trying to frame me. I found a bank account in my name with $10 million and 2 e-tickets for a flight out of the country. - So Jarod set you up? - Jarod was already dead when the money was transferred, so I guess it was his accomplice. - So if the FBI looks into the laptop... - Yeah, they're gonna think that Jarod wasn't just using me. They're gonna think I was in on it, too. - You didn't wipe the hard drive, did you? - No, that would make me look even more guilty. - OK, look, we're gonna talk to the lawyers. Maybe if we go to FBI right now with everything we know-- - No, I'm just gonna spend the next 6 months trying to prove that I'm innocent while the real criminal just walks away! No! Michael, I need to figure this out. - Well, look, this might not be our only problem. As soon as I heard about this, I had Owen pull the network logs from last year and flag anything that looked suspicious. Look at the log from 6 months ago. - Someone's flooded the server with "timed out" requests. Overloaded the system. It's a diversion to hide what the hacker's true target was. - What real target? - I don't know, but whatever it is, we have to assume ForSecure's software's been compromised. - What? No, that's impossible! ForSecure cannot be hacked! - From the outside. That's true. But if Jarod was using my computer to access the files directly, he was on the inside! - Abby, there's only so long I can keep this from the Securities and Exchange Commission, from our clients! My God! - I know! - When they hear about this... - It's gonna be bad. - Bad? With all the fraud on Wall Street right now, nobody's gonna tolerate another financial cover-up. This will be worse than bad. - I can't hand in that laptop, Michael! I can't! I mean, nobody knows ForSecure the way I do. If somebody's gonna figure out what Jarod was up to with all this, it's gonna be me. - Do you really think you can do that, Abby? - I have a lead. I just... I'm gonna need some time. - I'm gonna bury this report for 48 hours. Give you a chance to figure it out. - Thank you, Michael. - OK. And, Abby... These people put $10 million into your bank account just to frame you. Can you imagine what the endgame is worth to them? - Enough to have Jarod killed. Spider, Spider, where are you? Come on. "After you answer some questions. "Like who you are." - Hey! What can I get you? - I'll have a club soda. - I'll have a beer. Thanks. You asked for this meeting. - Spider? - Call me Nick. - Thank you for coming. - Don't thank me yet. You've got till I finish to say what you gotta say. - I'm looking for info. - How do I know I can trust you? - How do I know I can trust you? - What do you wanna know? - What did Jarod hire you to do? - Hack some system and clog it up with requests to keep it busy. That sort of thing. - Do you know who Jarod was working for, who could have had him killed? - You're asking questions I don't got answers to, OK? - In this bag is a laptop. I'm willing to bet that some of the answers are in there, if I just knew where to look. - And you think I might know where to look, is that it? - That's right. - Someone hires me to hack a system, I deliver. That's what I do. I don't get involved. - How can you be so sure they're not gonna do to you what they did to Jarod? - Keep it. - Please, help me. - Your time's up. - No, no, hold on a second! We both know that you were involved in this. Whatever is on my laptop has your fingerprints on it. So you either help me right now, or I'll take it to the FBI. Up to you. - You're asking a lot. - Well, it's a good thing you're a man who delivers, right? - OK. Let's go someplace safe. I'm parked up the street. Let's move quick. Last thing we need is to find ourselves in the crosshairs of whoever bombed Jarod's car. What is it? - You said "bomb." - Yeah. So what? - I never told you how Jarod died. I never told Spider that. - Shhh! Don't say a word. Just get in the car with me. Come on. Come on. Let's go! - What do you want from me? - I want that laptop. - No! - Let's go! - Let go of the bag! - No! - Let go of the bag! - No! - I will shoot you! - So this man who attacked me... Is he... - In the hospital. In critical condition. - He's in a coma. - Who is he? - His name is Nicolas Kovacs. - Is he Jarod's partner? - Doubtful. It looks like he was a hired gun. - Our jacket on him says he's got a background in arson and explosives. - Explosives? - We think he may have been behind the car bomb that killed Leary. - So you're telling me that... whoever Jarod was working with or whoever hired this guy is still out there? - Yeah. - This isn't over, is it? - What were you doing at the club with Kovacs? - I thought he was Spider. - Who's Spider? - A hacker. I was contacted online a few days ago by someone who said that they had worked for Jarod. And they went by the name Spider. So I figured that I could maybe get to the bottom of what Jarod was up to. So I... met him. And this guy showed up. - And no Spider? - No. I'm sorry, but can we maybe do this some other time? I... I'd really like to go home. - We have just a few more questions. - I'm sure it can wait until tomorrow. You know what? We'll have an agent take you home. Make sure you get there safe, OK? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Looks like we got that laptop after all. - Sorry? - Your laptop. Boys at the lab say it may take a few more days, but they expect to recover most if not all of the data on your hard drive. Something you wanna tell us? - No. That's great. - She's hiding something. - Kathy, come on! Do you really think she's still involved? - Maybe Leary wasn't using her. Maybe she's his mysterious accomplice and the two of them are a regular Bonnie and Clyde. - It could be, but it doesn't make sense. - Where are we on the DNA from the car bomb? - The lab said we should have it tomorrow by the end of the day. Do you want me to go swing by there? - No. Right now, I want you to find anything we have on our hacker friend. - Spider? - Yeah... Spider. - Thanks. - Abby Turner. You wanted to meet. Here I am. - Spider. - Yup, in the flesh. So why don't you invite me up for some coffee? Good idea! So at the club... you're not a waitress, right? - No. I figured it was a good way to check you out. Make sure you weren't a cop or something. - Why didn't you say something then? - I don't know. Something didn't feel right. Plus, that guy showed up. - Yeah, tell me about it. So what's your real name? I take it your parents didn't call you Spider. - OK, let's save the bio stuff for another time, all right? Spider will do just fine for now. - Fair enough. So can you at least tell me how you met Jarod then? - I didn't. Well, at least not in person. Everything was done online. - You contacted him? - No. He contacted me. Offered me a job. - What kind of a job? - The kind that pays. I've been more than accommodating here. If you wanna ask me any more questions, I'd like to see the green first. The money that Jarod owes me. That you said you'd triple. - I don't have it. - All right! Well... - Wait, no. Please. - Look, you're not a cop and you're obviously not a criminal, OK? So let me ask you this: Why do you even care? - I'm just trying to put my life back together. Herbal tea! My favourite. He wanted me to write a program for him. - What does it do? - It's actually pretty clever. The first part generates a series of dummy bank accounts. Lots of them. - And then? - And then it creates a series of transaction codes to move money from one account into the next account, and then the old account disappears after the transaction's done. And then it does it all over again. - That's the getaway. - What? - That's how Jarod was planning on stealing the money when the job was done. See, OK, let's just say that I decide to hack into a bank's computer system, right? I'm gonna steal a whole hell of a lot of money electronically from someone's account. I'm not gonna transfer that money to an account in my name and go make a withdrawal. - That wouldn't be the smartest move. - No, I'd move the money enough times to make it harder to track. Your program would let me do that while erasing any trace of where it came from, making it almost impossible to find. - Unless you know where the master account is. - Exactly. - So where'd the money end up? - No idea. That's what I need to figure out. - Well, good luck with that. - Wait! What? Aren't you gonna help me? - Pfft! I just did my good deed for the year. - Don't you care about a crime you helped commit? - I just wrote some lines of code for a guy. What he does with it afterwards is not my problem. And judging by the size of the gun pointed in your face at the club, I don't think I wanna make it my problem. - But we can do this. We can figure this out. - If you wanna figure out where the money Jarod stole is, why don't you figure out how he stole it? - Jarod would have only needed my computer to upload the program. What I'm looking for isn't even on that laptop. I have to get to Custodis. - Thanks for the tea. - Wait! I still need your help. - Take care, Abby Turner. - If I need something, how do I contact you? - You don't. - About time you showed up. - Ms. Turner, I didn't know you were-- I just went to get-- - I need you to sign out a laptop with a fresh install of ForSecure and bring it to the board room. Thank you. - But... All right. - I need another set of eyes. - I don't-- I don't understand. For what? - OK, to the right is the original installer package for the ForSecure program. All the files as they're meant to be installed. - And on the left is the program as it's installed on the mainframe now. - That's right. That's the one the banks are using. - So--so what exactly are we looking for here? - Differences. - Well, any anomalies like that, the system would've just caught, right? - Maybe. Bring up the details I wanna look at the modification dates. - Well, doesn't seem to be any discrepancies. - Yeah, he would have done something more subtle. - He? Who? - That file, right there. - Same creation date, modification date... I mean, they look like the same file to me. - Look at the file size. - Yeah, the one on the mainframe is bigger. Why would it be bigger? - Because that's where he hid the virus. - The virus? That--that does what? - That's what we're about to find out, Karl. All right, first we isolate a copy of the file from the mainframe. And then... Aw! Son of a-- - What? What? What? Look, shouldn't we tell someone about this? I mean, it's very... - I've got it, Karl. It's fine. I'm gonna need to borrow this. Thank you! - But... Ms--Ms. Turner? No problem. Glad I could help. - Agent Wilcox. - Yes, sir? - Wanna tell me why I'm getting complaints from the DNA lab about one of my agents buzzing around like a gnat, waiting on some report? - Yes, sir, because of the car bomb... for our case, sir. - Here. Next time, be patient. - Thank you very much, sir. Simon Davies? Who's Simon Davies? Yeah, Kathy, it's Danny. We need to find Abigail Turner now. Well, no, you're not gonna believe this. Are you in the office? - Abby? What's going on? - I found this. - What is it? A copy of a sleeper virus that I found in the code of one of the ForSecure files. This is what Jarod activated. - Boy! All right, how bad? - Much worse than we could have imagined. - What does it do? - It steals money. - How? - It siphons off the fractional remainder of pennies from every foreign-exchange transaction that's supposed to be protected by our ForSecure software. I mean, he figured out a way to use the security software that I created to steal from the money it's meant to protect. It's, like, geez! - OK, that's millions of transactions every single day. - I know. - How long? - Since the hack 6 months ago. And then, Jarod turned it off the night before he was killed. I don't know why. - Six months. That account's gotta have, what? - $300 million, or something like that. - Do you know where the money is right now? - No. A master account somewhere. - OK, look, Abby, this is no petty fraud. This is $300 million. That's a lot of money. And if the people who stole it figure out that you know about it, that you can trace the money back to them, you're putting yourself at great risk here, Abby. - I know, but what else am I supposed to do? The FBI already has my laptop. - They know about the $10 million? - No, not yet, but it's just a matter of time, if they haven't figured it out already. Everything on that laptop incriminates me, and they're just gonna think: "If she was so innocent, "why didn't she come to us sooner?" I'll keep you posted when I figure something out. - Wait a second. Where are you going? - I gotta find that money now. And hopefully, whoever it is that really stole it. I'm thinking that maybe if I bring that to the FBI, that will convince them that I had nothing to do with this. Are you expecting someone? - No. - Mr. Brobin. - Hello, Agent Anderson, Agent Wilcox. That's right. - Hi. How can I help you? - We're looking for Ms. Turner. We need to speak to her. Is she here by any chance? - There's been a significant development in the case. - Well, have you tried her house? - No, we just came from there. - I haven't seen her, but if I do, I'll let her know you're looking for her. - OK, we'd appreciate that very much. - OK. - Sorry for disturbing you in there. - No, not at all. - Have a good evening, Mr. Brobin. - You too. Good girl, Abby. - Don't scream. I'm not gonna hurt you. It's Josh. It's all right. Hey, you. - So I suppose I should call you Jarod now. Is that right? - Abby... - I don't even know how it is that you're standing here talking to me right now. - I know this is difficult for you to understand. - Just tell me why. Why did you do it? Why? - Because--because I had no choice. - I had a past, OK? It's something I'm not proud of. You know, I was trying to put it behind me, start over. When I met you, I thought everything was gonna be OK. And then a guy by the name of Simon Davies found me. - Buddy! - What are you doing out here? What if she saw you? - Relax! You didn't answer your cell phone so we had to check in on you. Speak of the devil. Simon here. Yeah, he's here. - Simon worked for someone who knew who I was, what I did. - It's for you. - He told me to create a virus, upload it to Custodis' mainframe or he'd take everything, make sure I went back to prison. - And you did it? - I did say no. But they threatened to kill you if I didn't cooperate. Look, I need you to know that I had no choice. - Who are these people? - I don't know. My only contact was with Davies. - What about Spider? - They put me in touch with her, said she did good work. - What about the $10 million in my account, implicating me in the crime? - That wasn't me. I had nothing to do with that. - Right, right. I was supposed to upload the virus. Turn it on and turn it off. If I did that, I thought they'd leave us alone. - And what, you were just gonna disappear, leave me to think you were dead this whole time? - When I left your apartment that morning... I got a call. - No, it's done. I'm on my way. And then I saw the police car. I knew they were there. It was a set-up. If I would have gone to that warehouse, I wasn't coming out alive. But I wanted to come back to the apartment. I wanted to-- to tell you everything, to come clean. To just run, run away with you. But then... No. No, there's no problem at all. We'll be there. - What's up? - Nothing. We gotta meet them at the warehouse on West 28th. - Let's roll. - You know what? I forgot something. - Keys. - I guess Simon and I were loose ends. Expendable. I just ran. Disappearing was the only thing I could do. - Why didn't you say something to me, contact me? Anything... - I didn't want to bring this down on you. I wanted to keep you safe. I figured I could get myself out of this mess. The longer they think I'm dead, the better my chances are. I followed you to the club that night. - You were there? - Yeah. I wanted to make sure you were OK. When that guy pulled his gun on you... - Let go of the bag! - No! -I had to do something to protect you. I had no choice, Abby. - Where's the money now? - I don't know where it is. - What do you mean you don't know where it is? You created the damn virus. - I know. I put a fail safe on the master account in case whoever it was that was blackmailing me didn't hold up their end of the bargain. Every 36 hours, I put a code into the account to keep it active. Of course, after I was presumed dead, the FBI took everything out of my place, including-- - Your computer. - I missed my window. - And then what? - And then the money was automatically transferred into another randomly generated account. I guess, after they realized that killing me made their money disappear... - They decided to come after me. - Exactly. That's why I'm here. - So you're telling me the only leverage we have, the only proof we have, is gone? - It gets worse. If the money is transferred 5 times without me logging in, the account disappears. - What do you mean, disappears? - The account and the money in it ceases to exist. I needed to be sure that if anything went wrong, it couldn't be traced back to me. - How much time do we have before the 5th transfer? - 21 hours. Abby, I'm sorry I got you involved in this. Please, you have to believe that. I meant what I said the other night. I love you. You know, it's funny because my career has always been about making sure that things were secure, keeping things safe. And then I let you walk into my life. I don't know what to believe anymore. I... - Abby, I-- - OK, we gotta go. - Wait. Where we going? - You're gonna find a place to lay low until I figure out what to do. - Wait a second. I can help you. - Unfortunately, I am gonna need your help to fix this. But for now, you're a liability, so we'll meet up later. - Anderson. - Yeah, Kathy. It's me, Danny. - What have you got? - Well, the, report on Turner's hard drive came back. And we found bank transactions and an account with $10 million in it. And the airline confirmed she had booked a flight two days after Leary's near-death experience. - You still think she's just a victim here? - Honestly, Kathy, I don't get this. - What's not to get? She got greedy. Hooked up with Leary and decided to pull an inside job. - OK, if that's how it went down, what is she up to now? Kathy, everybody I speak to, everybody I ask, says this girl is smart. She's smart enough to steal all this money, why be dumb enough to hang around afterwards? Look, me, I steal $10 million... God, I'm gone! I disappear before they even start looking for it. Right? She steals all this money, puts it into a bank account waiting, knowing, knowing that we're gonna find it there, and then she does buy 2 plane tickets but she never uses them. Why? - I don't know. You got me. Maybe she's not that smart, after all. - Yeah, or maybe... Maybe she's being set up. By who? Jarod? - No, it can't be Jarod. I mean, the car bomb was meant for him. Even though it did not do the job, no. Kathy... I think there's somebody else still out there. I think we should go and talk to her again, before we just go and arrest her. - And what good is that gonna do? - I don't know! Look, if she's as smart as everybody says, we'll let her figure it out. - I guess it's worth a shot. - I'll meet you at her apartment? I'm late for a meeting with the Federal Prosecutor. I'll catch up with you later. - OK, fine. - Good luck. - Thank you. - Whoa! What are you doing? - Look. - What am I looking at? - Third building down, top floor. That's my apartment. - OK, so what are we hiding from? - Them. That's the FBI. - Are you sure? How do you know? - Because I know. Everything I have is in there. Money, computers, files that I don't exactly want the FBI seeing. Everything. Now all I have left is this! Now please tell me, why is it the FBI are staking out my apartment? - Because I told them about you. - What? Well, why? - That night, after the club, I-- I told them I was there to meet a hacker named Spider. - Why would you go and do a stupid thing like that? - 'Cause they were asking me questions. What was I supposed to do, lie for you? Look, if you want this to go away then help me. So... Are you with me or not? - Do I have a choice? - Ms. Turner, are you home? Ms. Turner, it's Agent Danny Wilcox of the FBI. Is anybody home? - I'm sorry. We'll let you know. - You shouldn't be here, Anderson. - What happened? - Neighbours heard shots and called it in. He was a good agent. The apartment is registered to a-- - Abigail Turner. I know. She's a... a person of interest in the case Danny and I were working. - Looks like she's more than that now. Look, I'm not even gonna get you to try to back off. But we need to work on these cases separately. I don't want you anywhere near Danny's murder. - I know. - OK, what do you wanna do? - Issue 2 warrants. - Names? - Jarod Leary and Abigail Turner. - Done. - I said it's impossible. If Jarod added a timecode-in element to my program, but didn't enter the code, then the money is gone. It's as simple as that. - It has to be somewhere, Spider. - Yeah, that may be, but looking for it is like chasing a ghost. That's what the software I wrote does. It makes it disappear, so people like me, like you, can't find it. Thanks. - We track the money. - I'm sorry, but what part of "gone" was I not clear about? - OK, the money that Jarod stole from each transaction is like a plane taking off from an airport. Except, there are millions of planes taking off from millions of airports. And they all have different flight paths, different routes that are never the same twice. But they're all landing on the same island. - The master account. - Exactly. Problem is, if you're not tracking the plane, you're never gonna figure out where it landed. But if you were, if the money were marked, you'd be able to follow it all the way to its destination. - Except the money isn't marked. - The money Jarod stole wasn't marked. But the money we're gonna steal will be. - Grab your coat. - Jarod. - We have to go. Now. You sure about this? I mean, Jarod? - Listen, I'm not sure about anything right now. But if we're gonna get out of this, we need his help. Open up. - Hey. - We're fugitives. - I saw. I swear it wasn't me Abby. - OK, well, for your sake, you better not be lying. - I'm Spider. I know. She's crazy. - So wait, you wanna turn the virus I uploaded back on so you can steal more money to track that money through the accounts till it leads us back to the other money? - That's right. - I told you she was crazy. - We're wanted for murder. We can't just walk into the FBI. So what other choice do we have? - You know what? This could work. - You're both crazy. - Between the three of us, we can do this. - Yeah, all we need now is a laptop. - And what about a copy of the virus? - All right. - Let's do it. - Let's go to work, you guys. - Anything? - They're off the grid. No sign of Turner or Leary anywhere. - They'll surface. - Hey. You all right? - Yeah. How long was I out? - A couple of hours. You looked like you could use the sleep. - Where's Spider? - She went to get coffee. Let me ask you something. Can you trust this girl? Hey. - Well, look who's awake. I got you something. - What time is it? Almost 2:00. - Milk and sugar. - Thanks. - Tea? - Thanks. - And finally... a decent latte. - All right, where are we at? - Why don't you show her? - It just finished compiling. I call it "Following the Breadcrumbs." - Cute. What does it do? - Well, it's a worm that's just like Jarod's virus only it keeps a log of exactly where it and the money is going. So then it sends the information to us, so when we steal the money... - We follow the trail. - To its final destination. - Perfect. How much time do we have before the account and money disappear? - A little less than an hour. - All right, let's get on it. - There's some good news and bad news you need to hear first. - OK, what's the good news? - I sped up the money transfers on the new virus. When we start, we'll be able to find the master account with the $300 million. - OK, bad news? - When we upload the virus and access the master account, we have to do it from a Custodis mainframe terminal. - That shouldn't be a problem now, should it? - No, it's not a problem. We'll just break into Custodis and do it. - Are you serious? - Can you hack into the security system? It's a card reader with a microchip scanner. - Yeah, I think I have the tool for the job. - OK. - All right, let's do it. - I don't feel so good. - Thanks for the ride. OK, let's go. - How much did you give him? - Enough. He'll be out for at least an hour. - I think I forgot something in there. Can you bring the car and I'll meet you? - Yep! - You've reached the desk of Agent Kathy Anderson. Please leave a message after the beep. - Agent Anderson? Abby Turner... OK, we have 30 minutes before the money's gone. - Almost there. Put it in. And... I'm in. OK. Here goes nothing. OK, try it. - Yes! - OK. Building security is down. - Wait, wait, wait. Now! OK. Please tell me you haven't changed the password. We're in. The new virus is working. - OK, we have 10 minutes until that money's gone. So, whenever you're ready. - I think I have the master account... one second. Got it. Continental Savings. Your turn. Go in there and find the money. And? - I don't know. I can't crack the security. - Don't tell me you're giving up. - This isn't what it looks like. - It's OK. I called her. - You did? - Yeah, I figured we could use back-up. - Well, actually I could use some help. - Don't look at me. - Here, let me try. - Is it working? - She's almost there. - I don't know. - Ms. Turner, I have the utmost faith in your ability to do this. Please, just try. - Damn it! I can't do it. I can't crack the security. - You designed the damn program. - I know, to keep someone from doing exactly something like this. - We have 5 minutes. Just try again, OK? - I could have all day. I can't do this. I can't crack the security. I-- - Maybe you need a little more motivation. - Hey! We're the good guys here! - We're just trying to help, remember? - It's not like we're stealing the money. - I know. But you see... I am. Fifteen years I've been chasing white-collar criminals, giving everything I've got for a lousy government salary and a crummy pension that amounts to nothing, while they walk away with millions and millions. - But how did you-- - We had a file on Custodis. I was doing some surveillance. And then Jarod Leary walked back into my life. A two-bit criminal, sure, but I knew he had the skills. And I knew Custodis had access to the money and that's when I knew I was... finally gonna get mine. It didn't take long before I put the plan together. I had Davies put the squeeze on poor Jarod. He almost didn't go along. And then I had Davies threaten to murder you. And what do you know? I guess chivalry isn't dead, after all, is it? Kinda funny to think Jarod's gonna take the fall for it all now. My partner's murder, yours. And of course, stealing all that money Now, find the money. - I can't. - Not the answer I'm looking for. - You kill me and you won't see a dime. - No! - What happens if I kill her? The young lady said you had 5 minutes to find my money. Let's say you have a minute left. - I don't even know if I can do this. Please! - And it's started 5 seconds ago. Forty-five seconds. Thirty seconds, Abby. Please hurry. Twenty. - Abby. - Hold on! - Ten. - I can do this. I just need a minute. - Too bad you only have 6 seconds left. Time's up. Ms. Turner, I thought you could do this. Too bad. - Wait! Wait! Here's your money. - You did it? - Yeah, I did it. - How much? - Nearly $300 million. - You see. Now, that wasn't too hard, was it? Transfer the funds to this account. I'm a trained agent. You're a computer programmer. How did you think this fight was gonna end? - Differently, I guess. - Sorry to disappoint you. Brobin... Son of a-- - Are you all right? Yeah. I think so. - Thank you, Jarod. I--I realize without you... - It's OK. - I'm sorry. I wouldn't have trusted me either. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Where did you come from? - I was at home and I saw somebody log in using my password, so I came down to see what was going on. - I found it. - Found what? - Nearly $300 million in an account in one of our own banks. - My God. - Yeah. So what should I do with it? - ... move it. Just put it in one of the escrow accounts. Just keep the money safe until the feds figure out what we should do with it, OK? - OK. - Yeah, 911, someone has been injured at Custodis, 85 Stuart. - There you go. - Thanks. Is it safe? Yeah. I should probably apologize for that. - You had your reasons. So... Where are we at? - Spider should be here any second. I still can't believe that I know someone named Spider. - I mean, where are we at? - Um... I don't know what to say. I'm sorry, Jarod. I'm sorry that I didn't trust you. And I didn't believe you. I know now that you were trying to protect me. - Then why can't we just put this behind us? - Because you lied to me. - What choice did I have? - I know. I--I want to forgive you, and I wanna say I love you. I do. I wanna say those things. I just-- I don't know. - Hey. Can you give me a chance? Can you give us a chance? - Lock's still broken. Hey, hey. Hey! Am I interrupting? - No, not at all. - Gee, I hope some of that herbal tea's for me! So... what did the FBI say? Well, they matched Anderson's gun with the bullets that killed that agent. So, they dropped the charges against Abby and I. - Apparently, I'm lucky they're not charging me for obstruction of justice. How about you? - They offered me a job in their computer lab. - Working for the FBI! Not bad for a college dropout? - There's still, another mystery I'd like for you to solve, please. What is your real name? - That's where I knew him from! College. - Knew who? - Your boss. In one of my classes he was a guest lecturer. - Michael knew you? - I guess. Yeah, why? - You said that whoever was blackmailing you put you in touch with Spider. - Yeah. - That means they knew who she was, what she could do on a computer. - Yeah, but... - Hold on a second. Account 4488491. That's where I transferred the money. Can you get that please? - Yeah. Hello? No, she's here. She's busy right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, hold on. Abby, it's Deputy Munroe from the FBI. He wants to know where his $300 million is. - It's gone. It's all gone. Going somewhere? - Jeez, you scared me. Yeah, yeah, I'm taking off for a couple of days. Everything that happened... But... what are you doing in here, Abby? Do you need something? - Yeah. How about a confession? - A confession? - Don't play dumb with me, Michael. You're a very smart guy. I mean, you had me fooled. - You know, I don't think I like your tone, Abby. You should leave. - You wanna know what I think? I think you were involved from the start. - Involved in what? - And I think Agent Anderson knew you. She was investigating you, wasn't she? What did she, like, offer you a deal? A partnership? You both steal $300 million and you walk away rich? - Those are some pretty wild accusations, Abby. - You transferred that money into an account in my name. You framed me. Agent Anderson used Jarod to get what she needed. You used me. Tell me I'm wrong. - I saved your life, Abby. - Right, so that I could help you steal $291 million. - Me? Isn't it you the FBI thinks is involved in this? You are the one who has all the money hidden, not me. Am I wrong? Wow! You really are a piece of work, you know that? - I'm innocent. My hands are clean. And there isn't one shred of evidence to the contrary. You've got nothing. - You're right, Michael. And you don't have $291 million. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - Not smiling now, are you? - Where is it? Where is it? - I don't know what you're talking about. - My... money. - I don't know. Where'd you last see it? - I'm not gonna ask you again. - You stole it from me. I stole it back. It's only fair, right? - I don't play fair. - He has a gun. - FBI! - FBI! Put it down! Put the gun down! You're under arrest. - What's the charge? - Try murder one for starters, and we'll see where we go from there. - Thank you. - How, Abby? How? - How what? - How did you find the money? How did you transfer it out of the account? - I didn't. Spider created a fake interface and rerouted you to it when you logged in. You saw what she wanted you to see. - So, the money's still there? - Exactly where you left it. All $291 million. I agree with you. - Hi, guys! - Sienna. - Sorry? - You wanted to know my real name. That's it. Sienna. - Abigail. Nice to meet you. - As long as we're all starting over... Jarod. - Nice to meet you, Jarod. - Nice to meet you, too. Closed captions: Vision Globale
