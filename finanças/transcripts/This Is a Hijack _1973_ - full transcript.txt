(gun blasting) (dramatic music) (mysterious music) - Not a one night stand I'm interrupting, I hope. 'Cause that's the last thing I wanted to do. - What's this all about? - Is she a good cook? - I'm serious, what's this all about? - Come on in the living room. Leave the lady be so we can talk. Here. - This would be a good time to go back to bed. (body thudding) - Well, there's no use postponing the inevitable. You know what I get paid for. (fist thudding) (man grunting) Mr. Ritchie can't sleep nights. (fist thudding) - Hey. (fist thudding) (man grunting) (fist thudding) (man grunting) - Listen, friend, Mr. Ritchie's been kept awake nights thinking about you, so he wants me to tell you (fist thudding) that you'd better get in touch, in touch. (fist thudding) (man grunting) - I've got $80,000 of your markets here that we were due in nearly a month ago. - I know. I just need a little bit more time, that's all. - More time? Alright, I'll give you more time. How 'bout an hour? - I can't raise that kinda money in an hour. - I don't want to have trouble with you this early in the morning. You can't get my money, I'll have Dominic take you out. - If your goons so much as lay another finger on me again, oh they'll kill me. - What? - I'll make them kill me. - [Ritchie] I'm trying to be reasonable, and now you're threatening me? Dominic! - Now wait a second, wait a second now, I got something more to say here! - Sit down, don't you ever talk like that to me again. I don't care whether you live or die, but don't die stupid. There are always ways to get money. Think! - I have a headache. - Good, get the juices going. Come up with some reasonable way to get my money, we'll talk friendly. What about putting in touch with your boss? Simon Scott's not penny empty. - Simon Scott wouldn't give a dime to save his mother. - Well there are other things. - What other things? - Robbery, kidnapping. Goddammit, put a gun in your hand and hold up a bank. I don't care, don't embarrass me by making me have to sneak a bloody body out of this office. - Alright, maybe I'll be able to raise your money. - Maybe, I don't need no maybes. I'll make you like Hutton, I'll give you hooks for hands. - Alright, I'll get your goddamned money. - Now you're smart. - Yeah, I'm a genius. But you gotta take a chance, too. I need a loan, say 25 Gs. - You're a deadbeat already. I'm gonna loan ya more money? - I can get hold of a million dollars. A million dollars in cash. But I need some things. - Money's what you need, you ain't gonna get. - And there's nothing else I can do. Take a chance on half a million. - I don't think so. Dammit, Hutton, where are my sesame seeds? - 25 Gs can't hurt that much. - Alright, I may be crazy, but alright. One week, no more, one week or you're worse than dead. I'll personally gouge your big blue eyes out and stuff 'em down your throat. Dominic, you're on him, sleep with him. - Do I have to? (airplane engine revving) (dramatic music) (radio chatter drowned out by noise) - Okay, out of the system and onto the road. - Douse those nav lights, Bobby. - Hey you know what the boss got in mind for us? - That'll be about a 12 hour layover, at least. I'm pushed. - Oh ho, you ain't the only one, chief. - Out of my way, chitchat with Mike later. - I don't think it's inevitable like you said. Champ, Champ, you're gonna see to the luggage? - Okay it's on the way. - So where's my panda, who's got my panda? - I'll get the panda. - [Simon] Oh, good. - Can I talk you out of it, Mr. Scott? - Mr. Scott, Mr. Scott, what is this crap? He has been working for me seven years, and the first time he doesn't like what I want, he calls me Mr. Scott. - Alright, Simon, but I don't understand why. - Oh, why, why, why, will you stop being a schmuck? - Mr. Scott, why don't you put an arm around Mr. Phillips? Ah, fantastic. - I'm gonna close the deal for the Hawaiian hotel this week. I want a million in cash for me when I'm ready. I don't want to wait around for some goddamn bank to get ready to give me my own bread back, screw 'em. - What was that? - I said screw 'em. You go back to Dallas, you get my money, and you hold it. See, I know Gerson, believe me. Give that bastard one minute to think and he changes his mind. I lay it on him right then and there, it's done. No backing out. (birds chirping) (horn beeping) - You left at some ungodly hour this morning. Look, I don't usually mess in your business, but what was last night all about? - Is he still sleeping? - No, he's not. Last night was something out of a Bogart movie. - Not now. - Mike, your business is your business, but when it starts dumping on our love life. - Not now. - Mike, I'm for you. What am I with you for if I can't help you? - Not now. - Is it so bad you can't tell me? - I owe some people some money, that's all. - Money, why didn't you tell me it was money? I can let you have some money. (woman giggling) - I don't need money, I need money. - [Simon] My drink? - Oh his stomach is tightening up on him again. - My stomach's tightening on me again. Get me that thing with the club soda. Make sure it's got fizz. - What's he up so early for? - Where's my drink? - Honey, I don't mind Mike, but Diane's here. - Oh, Diane, well listen, she's cool. She's known me since my circumcision. Isn't that right, babe? - All about you. - A drink, Belinda? - [Belinda] No. - [Diane] You think you have something to show off. - Anything planned this week, Simon? - Same as last week, girls are a week older, that's all. - Not flying anywhere? - Girls and I are flying to Dallas. I close the deal for Gerson's hotel early Tuesday morning. - Well you taking guests? - Just my boy Champ. - Simon, I'd like to get out of L.A. for a while. You mind if I go along? - Give me my blue cardigan, babe. - I don't need ya. - [Mike] I'd just like to get out of town for a while. - Don't need ya, you bored, Mike, go to the zoo. - Well if it's a big deal, there may be some trouble spots or something on the way back. - I'm just packing underwear, coming right back. Tell you what, you stay here and put the house in order, 'kay? - [Man] What do you care about money now anyway? You got yourself a gold mine. - [Man] He'll pay, says I'm the one that's supposed to pay. - [Man] Look, you cuckhold me and it's Dutch. Forget it, you're paying, buddy. - There ain't a French chef alive that could make anything better than a cheeseburger with the works. - [Man] You calling me Sweeters? Why don't you call me Mr. Sweeters, then-- - What is this headache here? - Oh boss, don't pay 'em no mind. - Well? - Oh, Jesus. (lounge music) Diane? - [Diane] Yeah? - You alone? - [Diane] I think. - Look, Goose, I'm sorry about last night. Sorry, I can leave. - [Diane] No that's alright, don't go. You know I'm not uptight about my bathroom privacy. I'm just doing my business, nothing to be ashamed of. - Just realized this is the first time we've been alone all day. I'm thinking of quitting Simon and moving out of town. - [Diane] Can't you face whoever or whatever it is? (toilet flushing) - I stepped on the wrong toes. - [Diane] Well Sugar calls me Candy 'cause I make his peanut brittle. - What? - [Diane] Nothing, just reading graffiti on the wall. Sorry. (toilet flushing) ♪ Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah ♪ ♪ Someone's in the kitchen I know ♪ - [Woman] A man? - There'll be some money coming to me in Texas. - Is this for sure? - I'm committed. (upbeat lounge music) - This is the women's room, what are you doing in here? - Oh I forgot, I used to be a woman. I just had a sex change and I sometimes forget. Have a nice time, lady. - Is he good? - Hey look, what we do in bed is none of your goddamned business. - What are they arguing? No place is nice, every place is a circus. - Why not, you made it on the first date. - Maxi, they're always repairing, expanding. Great service, lousy food. - You're not making any sense. Where you going, the party's not over. - Great service, lousy food. Great everything, they turned the place into an auto mat. - Does this make sense? (gun blasting) (people screaming) - Take a nap around now, why did today have to be different? - [Diane] Simon, are you alright? - Not my day, not my day at all. - You could buy another cafe, though. - It's insane, you can't find a good restaurant anymore. No wonder drive-ins are so popular. People are afraid to get out of their cars, out of their houses. Ah, Christ, let's go, come on. Mike, get the check, will ya? And listen, Tuesday, be on that plane. Who knows what'll happen in Dallas. (swanky jazz music) (Dominic whistling) - Shut up, don't you know it's bad luck to whistle indoors? I told you, I don't need you. I can find my own help. - You need me. - I don't need you. You're not my idea of a friendly partner. - [Dominic] I am so friendly. - I don't know if you understand, I'm running this gig. - Sure, you're the boss. I'm just the eyes and ears for Mr. Ritchie. But I'm your friend. (chuckles) - Alright, then you can buy the drinks. - [Woman] Scotch water, scotch soda, please. - There you go. That be another one, Mike? - You interested in flying? - Flying, I love it, you know I lost my license, Mike. - I know, this isn't honest, but it pays. - Dope? - No dope, you don't even have to fly. Just make sure somebody else flies right. - Well, I've been going around nowhere for a long time, and this is something new on me. - $20,000, I guarantee it. - Could I get killed? - There's another 20 thou in it for you if you don't get killed. - Alright, just let me get my house in order, huh? - [Mike] Starts tomorrow. - Ooh, okay. - Oh one other thing I need. An air controller in L.A., one we can buy. - Are you kidding? They're all knights in shining armor. They're well paid, well trained, and highly screened. I don't even think they smoke. - All I need is one knight with a tiny dent in his armor. Just one. - You know fellas, I think we're gonna be alright. There is one guy, what's his name? Goes around with a hootch-a-ma-what. - What is it now, Hollis? - Hello. - Tonight about midnight you're gonna divert a 737 to the holding runway on the far east end of the field. - What is this, Hollis, another one of your practical jokes? - Neal, they're not joking. - I can't, that tower, it doesn't have visual contact with that runway. - You'll do what I say. - I can't. - My hair, do it already, do it! - Honey, look, there are special procedures for diverting aircraft. - And if you don't do it, I'm gonna take these pinking shears here and turn your boyfriend here into a real woman. He'll need falsies in his jockey shorts. - Neal, they'll castrate me, do what they want! - Hold on, Hollis, please, please hold on here. Look, maybe they don't really mean it. - You'd like to see me dead, wouldn't you? You never loved me anyway, you, you pervert! - Alright, alright, alright look, I'll do whatever, I'll do whatever, I'll do whatever they say, Hollis! Hollis, whatever they say. Do you, do you still love me? (plane engine revving) (radio chatter drowned out my engine noise) - [Announcer] Roger that. - Coffee, tea, or? - Hoo hoo, not right now, honey. Do I got time for a bath and a nap? - Not right now, honey. Simon's coming right now. - Mm. - Why don't you get her up in the air and put her in autopilot? You come back with me and I give you a bath. - Ooh. - And I'll dry. - I'll dry myself. - Oh, terrific, flying's a great idea. - It's an advantage to having $40 million and your own jet. You don't have to spend half your goddamn life hanging around airports. - I can't tell you how pleased I am to have been invited. You gonna be eating pretty soon. I've got it worked out for you, right here. - Hey, anybody home? - Hi, you can sit anywhere you want. The rest are getting on. - Oh no, that's okay, I'll keep those. What are you doing? - [Announcer] Final call for United Airlines. - Maybe we should get insurance, Harley. - I want my luggage last in, first out. - Okay. - The newlyweds here? - The reporters are on board. - Okay. - Who are all these folks? - Money mongers, who else? - Two magazine salesmen, he's giving them the honeymoon. Who else? - Well there's a Wall Street banker hustling for some kinda deal. And then there's an undersecretary of state, he wants Simon to push him for governor, mayor, president, I don't know, something. - Secretary of state and a banker? Okay. - Hey Mike, he wants to leave right away. - [Announcer] Final call, we have a nice airliner, flight 98. (drills whirring) - Hey. - Hi, Duke. - I don't want to sit over the wing. - This thing goes over here and snaps on. - You're the stewardess? - I'm anything you could possibly want. - I'm fine. - I'll get it before we take off. - Mr. Scott, you know it's on the tip of my tongue. I know him, but I can't remember. That colored fella back there, what's his name? - Aw, that's my good luck piece. That's Aaron Doty, was one of the great heavyweight fighters of the world. - Oh yeah, now I remember. - Yeah, when I was coming up, he was coming up. I won money on the boy. Now he makes money on me. Hey, Champ! 57 fights in a row, right? - Right. - Hiya. - How you doin'? - Look at him now. - Look, Mr. Ritchie, will you speak English? There are people on board I didn't expect. An undersecretary of state. No I'm not backing out, Scott makes a lot of deals. There'll be another ti-- Yes, sir, I know we made a deal, but it's. Will ya, sir, it's not too late if we wait. - What am I waiting on? - Michael, he went to check on something. - The hell is this? - [Pilot] Yes sir? - Let's go. - Wait a minute, wait! - Los Angeles ground control, this is Boeing 463. Request taxi clearance IFR to Dallas. - Hey, wait a minute! - Los Angeles ground control, Boeing 463, request taxi clearance IFR to Dallas. Los Angeles ground control, this is Boeing 463, request taxi clearance IFR to Dallas. Los Angeles ground control, this is Boeing 463, how do you read me? - Boeing 463, this is Los Angeles ground. Your transmission is garbled. Runway 24 unavailable, use runway 06 in hold. Check your radio. - Geez, the shipment is off to Siberia. Shouldn't have any problems with the radio. - Ah, Mr. Scott, I'm sorry about the delay, but we'll be getting clearance soon. - 40 million bucks and I can't get off the ground. - Simon, I have to get back to Washington as soon as we land. Can we iron out a quick agreement? Then we won't have to discuss business tonight. - Why sure, sit down. Later on you might be getting laid or getting drunk, or maybe even both. - Laura would never agree. All your money would be down the tubes if she left me. Divorce is political suicide. - Well it's your choice, Senator. Or it governor I'm supporting you for? You know that's why I can't stand politics. Too goddamned Victorian. - Let me tell you something. Congress is a fetisher's paradise. Vaseline is one of the biggest appropriations on the Senate's expense account. - Dildos second, prophylactics third? - What's prophylactics? - What's he doing, you think there's something wrong? - I don't know, I'll find out. - Wait a minute. - Hey, we're having radio problems. He might be able to help us out. - Nevermind. (plane engine revving down) (swanky music) (spring boinging) - Now what what she can do with her body. You'll love it, it's really camp. - Oh this one, I showed the state department last week. One of Dick's favorites. - It is? - Shh. - Who's Dick? - Hey what's going on here? - What's going on? - Sit down, Gil. - Right. - Are you crazy? - Do you understand this? - Yes, I understand. - Alright, let's go. - Have you flown this bird? - Yeah I can handle it. - Alright give me rotate, 117 knots. - Alright. (plane engine roaring) - How's he doing? - He's buried himself. - Okay. (speech drowned out by plane engine roaring) - Get your ass out of the way. - Down here, Mike. - Goddammit Christie, I told you to get your ass out of the way. - Let go of me! Champ! - Alright, hold it. - I don't like any of this. I want it stopped right now, Michael. - Shut up. - Come here, sit down. Where's the other couple? - They're in the bedroom. - Mister, don't you know that hijacking is a federal offense, punishable-- - I thought I told you to shut up. - Harley, be quiet. - If this is a disagreement between you and Mr. Scott, there's no reason for the rest of us to get involved. - Dominic, I said I didn't want anybody hurt. - Oh I'm sorry, I just get a little upset when things don't go my way. - Everybody stay seated and quiet. Bo will see to it. - Here's your favorite toy, Bo. You see Bo here, huh? Well he's uh, you know what I mean? - Chill, Dominic. - So don't nobody be a hero, don't rile him, hm? - Back here, Dominic. (fists pounding on door) - There's somebody in here. - Get out. - What? - Please move out into the cabin. We have business in here. - [Man] Well would you mind stepping out 'til we get dressed? - We've hijacked the goddamn plane. Now's no time to be shy, outta here, c'mon up, up! Holy Moses, get out of here, out, out, out, out, out. - Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down! - Harley, give him your jacket. - Here. - Never thought you were this dumb, Mike. You call this thing off right now, I'm willing to forget about it. - Bullshit. - We'll call it a joke. I can use it as a nice little anecdote, just a joke. - Look all I want is the money. Now you pick up the phone and you call Phillips in Dallas. - First thing you tell him if he call the police or the FBI you're as good as dead. - Nobody gets away with hijacking anymore. - Where's your head, buddy? You better hope we pull it off or you're dead. You got that so far? - Then you tell him to get together that $1 million in cash you were gonna use for the Gerson deal. You tell him to bring it to a private airfield, just north of Fort Worth. He'll get there before us, you tell him to wait. - You understand all that? - It's two o'clock in the morning in Dallas. I can't wake him up, he'll be sleeping. - Oh you're a darling. You'll wake the man up. Now tell me what you're going to say. - Do not call police or the FBI or you'll kill me. - You don't sound convincing. You don't sound like you mean it at all. - We don't need that. - Little kick, it won't hurt him. - Call him. (phone ringing) - Hello, yeah, can you hold? - Who is it, Ben? - It's Simon. - Oh, this kinda aggravation isn't worth 100,000 a year. - Put me on hold, if I get my hands on that bastard. Hello, Phillips, look don't put me on hold again. This is important, it's a hijack. - Yes, I understand. - What is it, what is it? - No, no one, only Pat, she's the only one here. Simon, I know they're there, so just answer yes or no. Should I disregard everything you just said and call the FBI? Alright, alright, yes, I'll be there. You can count on me, no, I won't tell anyone. - Ben, what's that all about? - [Ben] Dumb ball has got himself kidnapped. - You're not gonna get yourself involved? - [Ben] They'll kill him, he says. I have to deliver the ransom. - So you're gonna get killed? Listen, it's not your problem, Ben. Pick up that phone and call the police, it's their problem. - He was nearly hysterical. If I call the police, he'll really be mad at me. - Well then, then call him back and tell him to get another messenger boy. Listen, you can work for a lot of people. You're paid to manage his business. You're not paid to be his messenger boy. - I can't call him back. And I'm too old to change jobs. Anyhow, I'm next in line to run the whole show. I mean, Simon decides to retire or sell out, or dies. I'd be the head of the whole-- - What? - What? Operator, give me the FBI. (plane engine roaring) - Uh uh, don't do that, Smitty. - What, is he being dumb? - He's a fox, tried to switch on the mayday frequency up there and leave it open. - You know what you're doing? - I got more hours in flint jets than most guys log in a lifetime. Yeah, I know what I'm doing. - Not if you're dumb enough to hijack a plane, you don't. (tense music) - Bo, what's he doing up? - I let him be, Dominic, that's Aaron Doty. You remember him, he's alright. You remember the times when we used to go to his fights? - (laughs) Still the champ, huh? A lot of money passed hands when you stepped out of the ring. What's your gig here? - I'm Simon Scott's good luck charm. - He'll need all he can get, I'll tell you that. Go ahead, go ahead. - Simon, Simon! - No, I don't smoke. - Did you do what he wanted you to do? Is everything gonna be alright? - What'd I tell you? - What's it with you, buddy? - Nothing, nothing. - You ain't here to socialize. This is no party, you know. Sit back in your seat. - I'm quiet, I'm quiet. - You're just that far from dead now, so don't press me, I don't like you anyway. (club music) - Pierce, this is a hell of a story. We just need some pictures. A weird guy with a machine gun, our host, Mr. Wonderful, and a paranoid politician. I mean would you think of the story we're sitting on? - Would you think of the ass you're sitting on? It's very nice and I don't want it shot full of holes. Now think of that. - Think of the Pulitzer Prize. Sir, sir. - What do you want? - I have to go to the ladies room. - Let it wait. - No really, it can't wait. Airplanes do something to my bladder. - Your bladder? Alright, go on. - Okay, have a good time. (toilet flushing) - You know I'm depending on you, Champ. - [Champ] What for? - Well I kinda figure you're the only guy around here that's got any balls. I'm depending on you not to give me any trouble at all. - I'm a flunky, man, sort of good luck charm. I'm not a martyr. (Dominic grunts) - Nothing to be nervous about, honey. I been wanting to come over here ever since I first saw you. You're awfully pretty, you know. You work for that guy? - Not really. - You his girl? - I hope so, yes. - You smell awfully good. What kind is that? - I'm-- - Come on! - I'm sorry. - Don't be snotty. You understand? - I apologize. - Everybody here will be okay, they'll be okay. Everybody'll be okay if they keep their heads, you understand? - Yes. - Huh? You don't have to put your ass on the line by being wise and snotty. - I apologize. - Do you understand what I said, huh, you understand? Okay, alright, alright, you, uh, you bedded by with that guy. (laughs) Tell me about it, tell me about it. I like to talk about that sort of thing. (chuckles) - Let me see that. - It's nothing, good god, the flint's just bad. (gun blasting) - What's going on here? - Mike, do something, the man's a maniac. - [Mike] Dominic, what the hell's going on? - [Woman] He's got my lighter and I want it back! - Give back the lighter, Bo. - The girl's a wise ass, she's taking pictures of the whole plane. You owe Bo an apology, apologize. - I apologize, Bo, now sit down. - Go ahead, sit down. - Ladies and gentleman, there's nothing to be alarmed about. There's plenty to be scared about, but at the moment nothing to be alarmed about. Now the 737 that you're riding is a solid craft, designed to withstand unusual stresses. And we should, with favorable wind conditions, arrive at our destination in approximately 85 minutes. What we're gonna do when we arrive at our destination, only Dominic knows. (laughs) - [Dominic] Quack, quack, quack. (laughs) (man imitating duck quacking) Quack, quack quack, that's perfect! You got the big mouth for it. Keep it up, keep it up. (laughs) - [Bo] Dominic, what about that broad? - She's a cow. - Naw, she's an ass. Dominic, he's the ass. - Yeah, you're right, he's the man. Be an ass for us, Mr. Scott. C'mon you heard me. - Dominic you've had your fun. - Mind your business, I'm not bothering you. I'm not bothering your girlfriend. Be an ass for us, Mr. Scott. Belinda here wants to see you be an ass. Here, maybe this'll get your adrenaline going. ♪ Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O ♪ ♪ And on his farm, he had a ass ♪ - Let's hear the animal in you, Scott. (laughs) - On his farm, he had an ass. - Do the call for them, Simon! - Hee haw, hee haw. - Are you trying to be funny? Come on, put some heart in it, do it right. Or do you think you're too big to play our little game? Maybe I ought to deflate you a little, huh? - (imitates donkey braying) I'll do it for you. - I don't want you, shut up. - Can't you put a stop to this? - I don't like backtalk. My gun's meant to be listened to, and if it ain't listened to, it's meant to be used. - Don't be such an ass, Simon. Do what he says, bray. - Hee haw, hee haw, hee haw, hee haw, hee haw, hee haw. (people imitating animals calling) (Dominic laughing) - [Pilot] Oh this, that's an LTN 51 initial navigation system. - That's new, huh? - That's not new. You haven't flown in some time, have you? - Not for some time, but you never forget the how-to. Never, I'll take her. - You want me to take it off autopilot? - Uh-huh. - [Pilot] Okay, you got it. - And left a bit, now an easy bank to the right. (people screaming) - Alright, shut up, shut up, you hear me? - Take it easy, you're over-controlling, I've got it. - I've got it, I've got it, take your hands off. - Quit joking around. - What's going on? - Gresham's flying the plane. - Settle her down, Smitty. - Okay. - I thought you knew how to fly. We're people back there, not orange crates. - It's like power steering, you gotta get used to it. - Well you try taking a refresher course without killing us all. (plane engine roaring) - [Agent] Come on, move it, move it, move it. (sirens blaring) (agent chatter drowned out by sirens) - [Agent] Okay, you two guys right upstairs, right upstairs, two of you get up on top of the tower. Rest of you three go back there. Stay low and wait for my command, okay? When I say fire, you let all hell break loose, you hear? (helicopter blades whirring) - If nobody blows up, we'll all be out of this in an hour or so, Cami give them all a drink, settle them down. - Why wouldn't you say something? You got booze and you didn't say nothing. - Mike, can Cami get me one of my special drinks? - Why, Mr. Christie? - Mr. Christie, can Cami get me one of my special drinks? - Nobody around here's your slave. You want a drink, get it yourself. - Excuse me? (grunts) (Dominic laughing) - I'll get the drink. - Well. (laughs) (sirens blaring) - Alright, this is as far as we go. And this is as far as this goes. - What's in this? - It's full of bibles. What difference does it make, it's not worth a dime. Do you understand what I said? - I understood what you said before, Mr. Wyatt, but do you really need me for this? - People's lives are at stake. - I know, what about my life? If I go up to that plane with a suitcase full of bibles, I could get killed. - You won't get killed. - You wouldn't care anyway, would you? - Gordon, Sheriff Gordon's a bit of a pessimist who thinks I'm a bit of a sadist. - Well. - Just to be on the safe side, Mr. Phillips, you stay behind the car, just toss the suitcase, so they have to come out and get it. Now you see, we are interested in your safety, alright? - Your chances getting better all the time, Mr. Phillips. - Mr. Wyatt, there's no one that says I have to do this, is there? - Don't let this redneck scare you, nothing can happen. (Sheriff Gordon clears throat) - Alright, what do you see over there? - Nothing. - There? - Bushes. - Down there? - Lights. - Oh my god, this is Agent Wyatt. On my command, fire. (flares and fireworks booming and whistling) Mr. Phillips. - That wasn't funny, Mr. Wyatt. - They'll be aiming at the wheels. They knock the gear out, she won't take off. - (clears throat) I'm afraid. - Damn you, Gordon, this is your fault. - I thought my men did real well. - Alright, come on, you can wait in the shed. - Thank you. (plane engine roaring) - We were on a straight approach, gradual descent. Got the standard 2,500-foot altitude warning. - You turned it off. - Don't you? Well we lowered the gear and I got a green light, all except the nose gear. We got light failure sometimes in those old crates. But it turned out to be switch problems. Bent down to check it to fiddle with it, everybody bent down to check it and fiddle with it. - Nobody was flying the plane, huh? - Mm-mm, plowed into a swamp 200 yards off the runway. Airline's quieted it down alright, but they took my license away right after the investigation. - How far, Smitty? - Well if it's there, we should see runway lights in about 20 minutes. - What's going on back there? - Dominic's conducting a song fest. They keep singing, they'll be alright. (Gresham chuckling) ♪ Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah ♪ ♪ Strumming on the old banjo - Dinah was, hey, hey could you make me some coffee?

They'll listen this time. - Why don't you stop being a schmuck and leave him alone? - You're dumb for your age. You got just one minute longer than he does. - Dominic calm down, put that gun away. - Everybody's got something to say. - [Diane] This was a stupid idea, why don't you give it up? - It was Mike's stupid idea, and he's gonna give it up. From now on, everything's done my way. - I didn't plan on anyone being killed. Now why don't we just get out of this whole thing before anybody else gets hurt? - Oh, I love it, we get in a little trouble, you mess your pants. We were partners in this thing, Mike, but from now on you're just another body along for the ride, sit down. Avery. - Hey it's a very sensitive machine. One little squeeze you might be all over the walls of this cabin, now sit down. - And I want everybody else to sit down, too. - Harley's shot, he needs a doctor. Can't we please land this plane and go to a hospital? - Everybody's a comedian, lady we ain't got no Medicare. And young lady, if you don't sit down, the only help you're gonna get is from Avery. He's an undertaker. - Wyatt here, go ahead. - [Man] Okay, we show about flight level 310, heading 270, two hours of fuel on board. - Okay, 10-4. What do you want? - Wyatt, my report to Washington's gonna make you look like a real dumb bastard. - That makes you real happy, don't it, Gordon? - I got two men laying on stretchers out there. One of 'em got five kids and the other one got six kids. One of em's supporting two wives. Now who's gon' take care of 'em? Why don't you quit playing politics? Scott's got all the money he needs. He don't need anymore. - With you, crime still pays, don't it, Gordon? - Better to have rich crooks than dead victims. - That plane's gotta come down again, and I want you and your men back in position now. - Why don't you let me do it my way? - It's daylight now, Gordon. We can see better what we're shooting at. - You and the damn feds. - Short trip, heavy on the flack. It's gonna be a bummer for me to try to land this thing alone. - Well you got help now, sit right in there. - You two have a little disagreement? - What do you think? - Well you got about 40 minutes to do something, short of a crash. - Dominic, think. - [Dominic] Shut up. - Why don't we set the plane down and try and bargain our way out? - I'm gonna get out of the frying pan and into the fire? What do we bargain for? We end up in cars, they'll ride us down 'til there's no more highways to travel. I want that million bucks, and enough gas to get where we planned. - They're not gonna let us land and take off again, you know that. - Get the ground on that radio gizmo of yours. - Somebody ought to hear us on this mayday thing, right? - Get the Pope, I don't care. Somebody down there's gonna know I mean business. I'm not playing trick or treat up here. - Mayday, mayday, mayday, this is Boeing 463, come in. Mayday, this is Boeing 463, this is a hijack. Mayday, mayday, mayday, do you read me? This is a hijack. - [Air Traffic Controller] This is Wichita Falls Tower, we read you, please stand by. - I read you. - Now listen to me, you bastards! Am I on? - Yeah. - Listen here, you bastards, I don't want to hear anymore of your goddamn legal mumbo jumbo. You understand that? - We read you 463. - [Dominic] You understand that? - We read you, 463. - Alright down there. I've got 10 hostages aboard this plane. One's dead already, one's wounded. I want all police away from the airfield, and a million dollars in cash, and I want a fill on gas. And if I don't get what I want, I'm gonna start tossing people out of this plane one at a time until they're all dead or we run out of fuel and crash. You understand that? Now we get results. - They're gonna know you're bluffing. - Who's bluffing? - [Wyatt] I have no authority to release that money or allow you to further jeopardize the airways. - You'd better think, buddy, time is short. I'm gonna toss the first one out to you in 10 minutes. The rest go out fast after that. - I cannot allow you safe passage or release you any monies. - [Dominic] 10 minutes, that's all. - He's not crazy, he won't do it, million to one. - Well it's your lucky stars, Wyatt. It ain't your life he's dealing with. You ain't making odds, you'll run across him another time. I'm gonna call Washington and okay it. - Plane'll land here in 30 minutes, you'll see. - Who the hell you think you are, God? - I don't make deals with skyjackers, Gordon. That's department policy. - Yeah, but you helped write 'em. (plane engine roaring) - Now I expect both of you to do what I say. And Mike, you'll do what Gil says. You better, or this thing here goes. Nine minutes, we're almost home. You stay in that seat, I don't want you to be any trouble. - What do you want me to do, Mike? - Just do what he says, what can I do to help? - You just keep your hands and feet off my plane. I can handle it. - I got a problem, Mr. Scott. You want to help me with my problem? - What can I do? - What? You can get on the radio and sound more convincing this time. Tell the cops down there to get away from the field. Get a gas truck out on the runway with a million bucks with it. And I want to see they ain't up to nothing. I want to see 'em all in their underwear. Running around in their little pink jockeys. You think you can do all that? Now, you better act scared, tell 'em I'm a butcher. Or a psychotic killer. (laughs) But be sure and tell 'em if they don't do what I want, I will open the door of this flying palace of yours and toss you out. - Out, out, you wouldn't, you wouldn't throw me out. - Sure I would, you're practically out already. - I'll call 'em, but if they don't listen, look I'll give you everything you want, anything you want, I've got money. I'll give you money, look, my mothers give you money. My mother'll give you money, please! - Stop blabbering, I can't stand blabbering. Mr. Scott, you can't expect me to toss a lady out, can you? Not the newlyweds, not the pilot, not Champ. They would call that racist, now wouldn't they? Oh, but you. (Simon gasping) - Latimer, he's already bad off. Toss Latimer out, throw Latimer out! Throw that son of a bitch out. - No, no, what's the matter with you? - Go on, throw Latimer out. - Alright, you picked him. The blabbermouth quacker will talk to the feds. And if they don't want to listen, he goes out, then you. - Simon, don't let him do that. - Alright, Senator, come on, up, up, up we go. Don't get blood all over me. Come on, up, there we go, that's it. Stay in there, bitch. Gil, get me the ground again. - Please, what do you want? - Shut up, you're giving me a headache. Here, here, tell 'em, come on. - Please, you've got to help me. He's gonna throw me out. - [Dominic] Oh come on, that's rotten. They're not gonna believe that, come on. - He wants the money, some gas, and then he'll let us go. Or else he's gonna throw me out. You gotta do what he says, please, I can only beg. - Who is this? - My name is Harley Latimer, I'm with the state department. I've been shot and I need a doctor. And this man is crazy. - Hey that's good, crazy, crazy, tell 'em I'm a butcher. Tell 'em I'm a killer. - He's a butcher, he's a killer. - I'm a raving maniac, (laughs) a raving maniac. Yeah, Latimer here's coming down to meet you in five minutes, you won't have any trouble spotting him, 'cause he'll be splattered all over you. (laughs) - Look, Mr. Latimer, I know you're in a tough spot but you can help yourself out most by just staying calm. - You've got to do what he says. Call the state department, they'll tell you who I am. - Four minutes, four minutes and he's out. Out, you hear? Too bad for Latimer and everybody else on this plane. You hear that? And anybody gets near this plane, I'll destroy it and everybody in it, (laughs) yeah. Three minutes and Latimer walks on air. - Please stand by, stay on the line. - Stand by, my ass. - [Mrs. Latimer] Please! - Cops aren't gonna go for it. Can he really throw a guy out? - It's not easy to open a slide door. Could blow out at this speed. But he can do it, he's a go for broke guy. Is there anything we can do? - Yeah. - Ah the hell with it, come on, Latimer. - (grunting) Wait a minute, wait, I've got some money. $50,000. - It's Scott's check to you. What good is a secondhand check to me? - He's gotta make it good. Simon, Simon, plans I sold him. To the right people, they're worth millions. - They're no good to me, Latimer. You're really a loser. - You're the loser, Dominic, you're an impotent fool! - Jennifer, please, please, she didn't mean. She didn't mean it. - Yes I did, and get your goddamn paws off of me! - Please, Jennifer, please sit down. - Oh Pierce, you are so gutless! (people screaming) (guns blasting) (Dominic screaming) - Oh my god, your bags! (smoke alarm blaring) (fire whooshing) (fire extinguisher hissing) - We ever get out of here alive, I'll teach you how to fly. Field coming up. (plane monitor beeping) Damn it, it must have been damaged on the shoot-em-up during takeoff. The nose gear's stuck. Nose gear's stuck, I can't get her down. - What can I do? - The only thing you can do, Mike, is to try to get down in the forward hell hole back there and loosen it up, the trap door's on the other side of that cockpit. Go and take the gray gear handle counterclockwise. What can I say, Mike, try it, will ya babe? - I'll try. - Right. (plane engine roaring) (Gil sighing) - We're in business, baby. - You know I got some serious news for you, Sheriff. That backstabbing call of yours to Washington may get you your way now, but they're gonna remember you as the cause of this fiasco. You hear me, hot pants? - They might chuck a book at me tomorrow, and them hijackers might get away with a million bucks, but if anyone gets off of that plane safe, it's all on account of me. You can betcha that much. Here, boy. Hey, fruity head, the boys at the county gave me this gold watch for my retirement, and it starts tomorrow. Church is out, let's go boys. Yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil. 'Cause I'm the toughest son of a bitch in the valley. (plane engine roaring) - Sit down over there, we're coming in. - Is it too late to pick up a bet on a fella? - You bet on something after a race is in, be smart enough not to bet on a loser. - I'll take you, I like the way you've finished. (upbeat music) - Oh I oughta tell ya, they're all gone. - They're gone, no welcoming parade? - Somebody must've prayed. (chuckles) (plane engine whining) You know I've never done so many things so fast. Those airline boys are really screwed. I am a great pilot. (laughs) - It's all over then, isn't it, Mike? - One thing about this business, you never know when it's over. - That's not what I wanted to hear. - I love you, Diane, but it's gonna be a long summer. (Gil sighs) - Everything's okay, you can all leave. - You should've been man enough to let him kill you. - Yeah, well that's a flaw in my character. - Pierce, besides an exclusive on this story, I want a divorce. - You alright? - No. - Trouble, it never rains, it pours, and I had such a sweet deal. - [Woman] Mr. Orlando! - We've only been married two weeks. You can't get divorced after two weeks. - Mr. Orlando! - Watch it, I'm not a bag of your stinking laundry. - Here you are, ma'am, here you go, sir. - No, no. - [Woman] Mr. Orlando? - Here, here it is, ma'am. Here you go, you can take it, here it is. - I told you we should have taken out insurance. - Here you go, ma'am, don't anybody want it? Go ahead and take it, it's in here. It's this, here, here it is, here you go, ma'am. Hey you, black boy, is it any more hostages in there? - Uh, a few, what's that? - Well what the hell you think it is? - Janky son of a bitch, get out of my way. Will you hold my goddamned money? Now, Diane, you get your ass down here right now. You get a car and a doctor out on this field. Now it's all finished, you do as I say! - Is it any more hostages in there, any more people in there? - No that's it, no hostages.
