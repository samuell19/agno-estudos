Who's there? I'm opening the door. Dad! - Grandpa! FANGS OF DARKNESS: VENGEANCE (Shin Gokinzo Yaburi) WAKAYAMA Tomisaburo as Ichibei NOGAWA Yumiko as OKiri OWADA Shin ya as Sanji KIKUCHI Yuko as Oasa HANAZAWA Tokue as Oki Sendayu SAGAWA Tetsuro as YASHAUJIN Isshin Original Story by OKUMURA Masaru Screenplay by ASUKA Hiroshi Music by MIYAGAWA Tadatoshi Directed by KURODA Yoshiyuki It's here, sir. Fangs of Darkness?! That robber's looting around the town, now he breaks into my mansion?! Summon everyone! Take precautions! Don't let him in! Yes, sir! There he is! CHUSHINGURA DUPLICITY This was written by Ieyasu. There he is! - It's Fangs of Darkness! Be quiet. Open the door! OFFICIAL BUSINESS This way! Please, wait! You're Fangs of Darkness, aren't you? I'm working for a carpenter, but I can't make ends meet. So I was thinking it might be better to become a robber. Boss! Please let me work for you! Please? What's the point then... Why did you help me? If you won't take me in, it would have been better to die at that mansion. Come on, please! Dad, did everything go well? Yes, it did. Look at that! It's Fangs of Darkness again! Isn't this the fourth? I heard Go-en's mansion was attacked, too. Do you know who was attacked this time? I bet the rich folk are panicking! I can't yell it out, but I feel good! It served them right! Even if you don't yell I can hear you. Watch your mouths, or I'll arrest you. Hello, officer. Let's get back to work! What a thing to do with calligraphy from the shogunate. Shokichi! Take it down. What are you doing? Come here! Who are you? Let's go, Shokichi. What's going on? Who's that jerk? He's to be feared. One of the Oniwaban (Secret agents/ninja). I'm no match for him at all. Let's go. Don't look at him! To have let him steal the Tokugawa family's signature scroll. I am deeply ashamed. There are no words to apologize enough. This is your penalty. You're relieved of your position, and will be placed under house arrest. Yes, sir Judging by the last few day's incidents, I'd say this is a revolt against the Tokugawa shogunate. What do you think, Sakakibara? I agree. We need to find out who has done this and why, as soon as possible. It could affect the government conference. Sakakibara! This is no time to be calm! We don't have time to plan and investigate. You might be dismissed too if you don't act immediately! Yes, sir! But, just who could the Fangs of Darkness be? Hello, boss. Did anyone get any information about Fangs of Darkness? I've been asking around, but nothing so far. We were about to break into the Ginza's warehouse, but we can't do our job because of the increased patrols running around. We'd be napping on a mountain of treasure at a hot spring by now if Fangs of Darkness hadn't showed up! Really, he's an eyesore! How was it? Was it Fangs of Darkness? Yes. It's not clear yet though. What kind person is he? He's just a pharmacist, but Rat Hag says he doesn't look normal with his guarded behavior. I'll kill him! Who are you people? You're the Fangs of Darkness, aren't you? What are you talking about? I'm Hitodama Nisuke. You've heard my name, right? Sorry... I don't know. Don't play dumb! You're such a bothersome newcomer, disturbing our job! You should show some modesty! Wait a minute... If you won't quit, you'll die! I'm really just a pharmacist. Not a thief. Quiet! We're the same kind of people. You can't trick my eyes. No, I'm not trying to trick you. Are you still playing dumb? Wait! Thank you so much, sir. You saved my life. Don't lie. Excuse me? I don't believe you're just an artisan, knocking them out while pretending to escape. No, I was just waving my fist in panick, maybe it hit somehow. Whatever. Go now. Yes, thank you again. Excuse me. The lord is coming! Shimotsuke. - Yes, sir. Haven't you caught the thief called Fangs of Darkness yet? I'm afraid we haven't found out his identity as of yet. Such a despicable man, revolting against the Tokugawa shogunate. Bicchu, call the Oniwaban. Yes, sir I am Yashagami Isshin, the head of Oniwaban. Our lord has ordered you to Kill the Fangs of Darkness. Yes, sir! Kill him no matter what it takes. For the sake of my pride as a lord of 80.000 koku, I cannot let this disobediance go unpunished. Understood? At the risk of my life. Go. - Yes, sir! They think he's just a robber, but I don't think so. You think he's a ninja like us? There was a hole about 9 inches in diameter on the Hayashi family's mansion which was attacked. Both the door lock and the lattice windows were perfectly protected. If he broke in through a hole of a mere 9 inches... It would be impossible without mastering the Hari no Anakuguri technique. The number of suspects is reduced. Listen carefully everyone! This order comes directly from our lord. We must accomplish it even if it costs us our lives. Ready yourselves. Yes, sir What? You want to see Kurokuwa's records? Yes. I'll decline. This is Kurokuwa's biggest secret, it reveals all the details about us. I cannot show it to anyone, even you, the head of Oniwaban. Let me tell you this... Our mission was appointed by our lord in person. Can you show me it? Sasajima Hyoubu's first child, Ichibei. Dead at the age of 18. What is this? We had our hopes with him, he was a great young man. But he sadly passed away after a heart attack all too soon. Thank you for your help. Boss. He said he was searching for the Fangs of Darkness. But what could his real intentions be? It's easy. He's hoping Ichibei is alive. That's absurd. - Well... I've also been unconvinced about Ichibei's death. His father is also of importance. Hyoubu was sent to Owari as a spy by our lord. And half a year later... It's Sasajima Hyoubu! I'm back from my mission! Open the gate! To the Kurokuwa family: We're vassals of Owari, hereby capturing your henchman, Sasajima Hyoubu. Our lord, the Chief Councilor is angry from being investigating whilst having nothing to hide. I hope you understand and come to see our lord. I'm the head of the Kurokuwa family, Oki Sendayu. There's no henchman by the name Sasajima Hyoubu in our family. Really? Then you don't mind if we kill this man right here? That's none of our business. Do whatever you like. We let them kill Hyoubu. But it's the destiny of spies. Does the son who lost his father feel the same? If Ichibei is alive, plotting revenge for his father...? The Fangs of Darkness is Sasajima Ichibei? He very well could be. If he is the Fangs of Darkness... it'll be a matter of life or death for the Kurokuwa Family. Unless we kill Ichibei ourselves... we'll loose our position of serving the Yagyu Family. Sukejuro... Shirobe... Find out if he's alive or not. Yes, sir Hello, Mr pharmacist? What's wrong? Please, I need medicine. I'm suddenly feeling sick. Yes, I've got medicine for you. But you'll go cold in this rain. My friend's house is near here, let's go there. Here, put this on. Thank you so much. - It's okay, come. Osome! Yes? Oh, you're getting wet. She's an emergency case, could we borrow a room for a bit? Of course. Thank you. Are you all right? - Yes. I'll give you medicine. Take this. His medicine works well. You'll feel better soon! Have some water. She better rest for a while. Is it okay if she sleeps here a bit, Osome? We won't have any customers in this rain. Have a good rest. - Really? I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Ittsan, Otake has been sick in bed again. Will you see her? - Has she? Lung trouble is not easy to cure. I'll have a look. Please. - Thank you for your help. What a kind pharmacist. He really is. Many people look down on and mock us courtesans. Ittsan however, doesn't treat us any different or make fun of us. You met a good man. I really did. I've found out what Sasajima Ichibei's special technique is. Hari no Anakuguri? Exactly. It's a technique handed down in the Sasajima family. This means Sasajima Ichibei is alive. The Fangs of Darkness must be Ichibei! It's all part of his revenge on the government, for his father. Excuse me. - Hello. Oh, hello. Welcome. Is there anything wrong? - Well, yeah... It's about Fangs of Darkness. The one in all the rumors? They say his actual name is Ichibei. Is that so? So, I've been ordered to find all men named Ichibei in this town. Right. My name is indeed Ichibei, too. But, sir... I'm the Ichibei who's had this pharmacy right here for twenty years. Exactly, officer. We all know about Ittsan very well. He can't be the one responsible. Boss Heikichi knows that too. Right, boss? Yeah. I told him so as well. I know. Listen... They are very serious about this. I'm sorry, I don't want to say this but... Couldn't you change your name? I appreciate your concern, but this is a name I got from my parents. I understand. But maybe you could change "Ichi” to "Ni" or "San"... or something like that. So it'd be Nihei, or Sanbee? - Right! You're kidding, right? Please! - Sir.. By the way, would you like more medicine for your wife? Thank you, that won't be necessary. She's much better since the last time. But... - Thank you again. Okay, let's go. Sorry I couldn't help. Think about it, all right? - I will. Have a nice day. Goodbye. We're not making any progress like this. I left it to the local police as asked by the Shogun's elder, but... We won't get anywhere if we continue such a search. If Fangs of Darkness purpose is revenge, wouldn't he be planning another attack? The next target will be a priest in Edo. But there's too many priests to protect. It will be a priest with treasures related to Tokugawa. Excuse me. Welcome, come in. Oh, it's you. Yes. I came to thank you for the other day. Thank you for coming. I'm sorry that I didn't introduce myself earlier. I manage a small restaurant in Ryogoku. My name is OKiri. Dad, pass that. You look better now. That's good. Thanks to you. If you hadn't saved me I don't know what could have happened. I've brought you a little something to eat. Oh! You really didn't have to. - Please. Thank you so much. Well. I came to repay your favor. Oh, that's not why I... But I want to help you in some way. Osome told me you've lost your wife. She told you that? My wife got sick after giving birth to this child. It's been fifteen years. I'm sure you've had hard time. Could I please visit from time to time and help you in some way? Help me? Yes! Isn't this laundry? Let me do it! No! It's dirty! But... - Please, don't worry about that. I'm fine. I appreciate your kindness. Okay. Thank you for everything. Don't mention it. Hello. - Welcome home. Preparing for supper? - Yes. Hey! There's a girl at your place! What a lady-killer! Welcome home! Okiri? I'm so sorry, I still needed to thank you somehow. I can understand if you're mad, but I made you supper... Isn't it nice to be greeted with a hot meal after work? Yeah... Please enjoy! Excuse me, I'll fetch you some washing water. Hey, don't peek! I know. Go home. Thanks for the meal. Oh, are you done? - Yes. Then I should be leaving. You can stay a bit, right? Dad, I'm staying at friend's tonight. I'll take care... Have a good night. Here... Have some, please. Well, yes. Thank you. Okiri. Yes? You must think my daughter is little strange? No. I think she's a good girl. You do? I brought up her all by myself, you know? I can imagine how hard it was. Well, yeah. - Yes? If you would like... What? By all means... But.. - Really Come. Then... Excuse me. What's this? Morning. - Good morning. Got up early? Hi dad, I'm home. - Welcome home. Where's Okiri? She's already gone. Well, how was last night? It was, all right. Can I help you? Come with us. What? KITAMACHI MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE KITAMACHI MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE Kitamachi Magistrate, Sir Sakakibara! Kitamachi Magistrate, Sir Sakakibara! Magistrate? Are you Hitodama Nisuke? Yes, sir Will you lend me hand? You want my help? It's regarding Fangs of Darkness, Ichibei. If this continues, it can threaten the authority of the government. I'm sure you have influence in the underworld. Will you pursue Fangs of Darkness as my right hand? You mean become your dog? Yes. I know you're upset about Ichibei, too. Well... I'll overlook your transgressions. You just make sure to get Ichibei. You say I can do anything? Almost any means are allowed. Take my sigil. This'll come in handy! Magistrate, leave it to me. I'll make sure to kill Ichibei. CERTIFICATE Dad? Are you doing it again? Yes. Where's next? What do you think I should do? Sir Kaga. Sir Kaga? He has nothing to do with the government. He does! The daughter of the shogun, Princess Yo, is marrying Sir Nakada. That's right, that'll be soon. Their wedding is in five days. I heard Princess Yo is as old as me. Do you think you can do it? Not being given a grave... I feel sorry for grandpa. Are you sure it's ok? Are you sure? KAGA CLAN'S MAIN RESIDENCE Boss! Long time no see. Thank you for saving my life the other day. My butt still hurts though! Boss, I've been wanting to repay your kindness. Boss, I'll do anything I can to help. Please make me your underling. Please! Boss! Is the next target Karasuma? Don't make such a stern face, please say something! Please boss! Let me help you, boss! Boss! I'm home. Welcome home! Come in. Sanji, was it? Let me be clear, I'm not a robber. Then who are you? I'm a pharmacist. I just have a grudge against some people with authority. Sanji, are you happy in your life? Since you want to become a robber, I'm guessing you're not. Where are you from? Far away. Hamamatsu. Hamamatsu? That's a nice place. Sanji... You should go back and get a proper job. You'll be happier that way. No, I can't do that. Please make me your underling! - You can't! Please! - Enough! Go! Never come back here! Sanji. Yes? I think you should do as dad said. You'll die if you get close to us. Die? What on earth is he planning? Revenge. I can't say any more. Never come back, okay? Revenge? Okiri! Can I come in? No. Why not? Are you gonna drive me away like that young man, too? Why do you hate people so? You're cold. I'm just bad with people. Is that so? Yet you where so kind to the women at the Konyaku Island brothel. They're my regular customers. Is that so? Then maybe I'll get a job there too. Ichibei! - Don't enter, please. It's better this way. Please don't come back here. I leave this to you. Yes, sir Today's the Princess Yo's wedding. We must take every precaution we can. Chief retainer! Emergency! What is it? - Look! "I'm coming tonight. Fangs of Darkness."” What is this! On Princess Yo's wedding day? Let's call for the local police to stand guard. Hold it! We can't do that. On our clan's honor, we can't do that. But Chief Retainer, we don't have enough guardsmen available because of the wedding! You and your men will stand guard. I leave it to you to preserve our Kaga clan's honor. Yes, sir! They've announced Princess Yo's departure! Hurry up! Move! You should take your medicine. Princess. Come here. Somebody, help! Help! It's the princess! Help! Princess! Chief Retainer! Catch the one who did this! Go! Hurry! Ichibei! "I return this to Princess Yo. -- Fangs of Darkness" Boss, he did it again. I know! Making a fool of me! Chief Elder, how shall we proceed with the current Kaga clan's case? Although he's only a daimyo, his is still a big clan. It's quite troublesome. All who've been attacked by Fangs of Darkness thus far have been dismissed or lost face. Kaga clan must meet such a fate as well. What did the Kaga clan do? They didn't do anything at all. Sir? Nothing happened to the Kaga clan or to Princess Yo. Chief Elder! Understood? Hey! Where is Ichibei? Where did he go? I don't know. I really don't know, right, Otoku? Are you all right? - Let me get him! Calm down. So, Ichibei is alive. Revenge against the government? Such impertinence! When his identity is discovered, it's Kurokuwa's duty to stop and then Kill him! Yes, sir! Isshin, what's his next target? It's probably one of the three Tokugawa branch families. Is it Mito, Owari, or Kishu? I don't know. But my people have already left for the Mito, Tokai and Kishu Highways. Isshin, it's no longer a mere matter of revenge against the Kurokuwa! It has become a serious matter concerning the whole government. You must stop the Fangs of Darkness! Understood? - Yes, sir! Oasa! There's a pharmacist with a child crossing this mountain. Don't let him pass, Kill him if you can! Yes, sir! There was a father and daughter going on a pilgrimage, but no pharmacist. What? A father and daughter on a pilgrimage? Ichibei has already passed here then. Okiri! You betrayed us! What are you talking about? Fangs of Darkness killed Kaga. Why did you approach Ichibei? Did you betray our boss? No! I was being deceived as well! He's the Fangs of Darkness. I heard his identity is a government secret. How was I supposed to know. Okiri, look at this. I'm not chasing him because of my pride as a robber. We're working as vassals to the Kitamachi Magistrate. We have to be serious about this. The Kitamachi Magistrate? I'm Nisuke, this town's greatest crime lord. I'll definitely outwit him before anyone else. Okay, go ahead. Okay, go ahead. Thank you. What is the matter? Nothing to be concerned about. Go on. Okay, go ahead. Seems like the government is thinking the same thing. Oasa... Can you hand me a mirror? HAMAMATSU Oasa. Oasa! Ichibei, you've been alive all this time. The Kurokuwa shouldn't be concerned with revenge. Let it go. There's no use talking. Even if you won't listen, I'll ask. Won't you stop acting recklessly? I challenge you. It's our mission to protect the Tokugawa crest. Come. Throwing your sword! Coward! A ninja don't know the meaning of cowardice! Father... NAGOYA CASTLE Wait. Fangs of Darkness is just a robber, isn't he? There's no need to fret. He's no normal robber. The Tokugawa crest has been disgraced. The Shogun's honor is at stake if you're attacked next. We must protect you, no matter what. Understood. We just need to protect him, then? Leave it to us. I offer you my help. Don't be silly. Owari will take care of ourselves. We don't need Edo's help. Go home. Then I cannot fulfill my duty. Please, let me join your guard. No! Do you think the Owari family can't arrest one robber? It's an order from the Shogun. It's no use. Take your leave. What's so funny? Do you see the strength of the Oniwaban? Oasa... You'd like to wear wedding clothes one day as well, huh? Not really. Your father's no good. I haven't been able to give you in marriage. What are you talking about? Let's go, it's not far to Owari. Right. Would you like some dumplings? Oasa. Come out. Okiri! Dad, it's OKiri! Are you a member of Oniwaban? Or a thief? The other day, you wheren't even sick. I could tell. Will you kill me? I wouldn't care. Is that so. Dad! Ittsan... I heard it. You're getting revenge for your father. I envy you. You had such a great father, you'd risk your life to avenge him. I was a fatherless child. I don't know my fathers face, nor his name. Boss. When did you get to Owari? This morning. I was thinking Owari must be Ichibei's next destination. Do you know where he's headed? Yes. Is his target the castle treasury? It's probably the golden Shachihoko. ("Shachihoko" is a mythical carp) The Shachihoko? Rumor says it's made of 38,000 ryo gold coins. He sure is aiming high. He's an extraordinary man. He seems to know my true self, but only keeps me away. It's like I'm wrapped in some huge, fluffy thing. A mysterious man. Watching Ittsan, makes you look smaller, boss. What?! Calm down! Reactions like that are what makes you look small. Are you going to betray me? If I would betray you, I would've done so long ago. "On my way. Fangs of Darkness." So he completely destroyed the Kurokuwa family. Kurokuwa family? Fangs of Darkness, Ichibei, is such a man. That stone fence looks good to watch from. I want that basket, too. The Owari are all over the place. Their defense is perfect. It is. Oasa... Remember that man. He's the head of Oniwaban... Yashagami Isshin. He's trouble. Isshin. I've assembled a party of 200 riflemen, and spearmen and archers, 150 of each. Their placement is up to you. Thank you. 50 riflemen right there. And we need a gatekeeper in the castle tower. It'll be an impenetrable defense. Chief! A suspicious man says he wants to see you at the castle gate. I'm Yashagami Isshin. Who are you? My name is Nisuke. I've been chasing Fangs of Darkness by the Shitamachi Magistrate, Sakakibara's orders. Who is this man? He's a thief. Let us help you. Please give me directions. Nonsense! We don't need any help from a fellow like you. Well done. I've finished setting our defenses, but there might be weak points still. Why don't you try to find them and break through? That's to expect from the chief of the Oniwaban! You're asking me to test your defenses myself, right? Right. Gladly. I will serve my lord in whatever way I can. Let's give it a try! It's Ohitsu. Ohitsu? - The officer is gone. Thank you for hiding us. Don't mention it. I owe you for healing my friends' diseases. I'll let you know when they come again. Thank you. Be careful. The courtesans really saved us. It's because you've always been kind to them. Have you found a way to enter the castle? We need to find the Quail's path. What's that? Somewhere in the castle, there's a secret passage where the lord can escape in an emergency. That's our way in. This must be it. I can see light leaking through. Hey. Boss, it's the exit. The Oniwaban's nothing special, huh? The castle tower's right there. I'm the victor! Let's go! - Yes, sir. You deceived me! Isshin! If we received help from thieves, there'd be dishonor upon Owari. Clean this up! Yes, sir! Ittsan! Please open the door. It's OKiri. Ittsan! Okiri. I have no business with you. Go away! It's very important! Please, open the door! - No! Dad! Open it... - Please open it! Ittsan! Oasa, close it. I knew you were here. I'm really glad to see you again. What happened to you? Ittsan... You're planning to enter the castle by the Quails path, right? Don't go there! Yashagami Isshin has set a trap. Nisuke and the others just got shot down by riflemen... as we entered through it. Why are you telling me this? It's painful to admit... Ittsan... I've fallen in love with you Ittsan... You have a great purpose. Survive, Ittsan! Oasa. Don't take the Quails path! Quiet. I'm such a fool. I wanted us three to be a family. It's a stupid dream. The Quails path! Ittsan! Ready? Hurry up. Mom... She won't die. She'll be fine. Is there no way in? Without the Quails path... Sanji said he was from Hamamatsu, right? Excuse me. - Yeah? I heard there will be a northwestern wind when that cloud appears. What do you think of tonight? Well, yeah... There'll be a strong wind tonight. I see. Thank you. Isshin. Are you sure that Fangs of Darkness is in Owari? It's been ten days without any action. It's quite strange. He might be trying to catch us off guard. What's that? What's going on? It's a kite. - A kite? He's trying to reach the castle tower from the sky! Move out! - Yes, sir! What's wrong? The wind stopped. Dad! It's Sanji! He's saving us! Leave handling the kite to me! Sanji. Thank you. Boss! Oasa! There! I'll be right back. A symbol for the Tokugawa branch families... I'll blow up this golden Shachihoko for all to see! He's on top of the castle tower! Gomi. This is for Sasajima Hyoubu! You hear me?! Grandpa... Son of Sasajima Hyoubu... I'd like to say it's over after your revenge is settled, but I can't let you go. Well done. Come. Are you going to sacrifice yourself?! Stop that nonsense! If that blows up, it's nothing but a few tears for the Owari! Don't die! I'll survive no matter what! Directed by KURODA Yoshiyuki Production: FUJI TV & TOEI COMPANY - 1983
