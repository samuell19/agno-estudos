Hey! What? I cut my arm. Told you to stay in your room. But I've been in there ever sin... - Shut up and just leave me alone. That's what you get for not listening. I'm going out. Hey mom! What? You know what today is? I don't have time for your games right now But mom, It's a really special d... - Dammit Eli! You got blood all over everything in here. Mom, I didn't mean t... - How many times... do I have to tell you to stay in your room? Now stay in there here or so help me! Mom, wait! Mom? Dad! What's up man? How are you doing? Good. Hey, look at you. Where's your mom at? Out. Out. What's that mean? Where'd she go? Hmm. Skank owes me money. What, no booze for your old man? Hey dad. Hey kid. Know what today is? I do buddy. It's Friday. It's alright. I know where your mom keeps her cash. Where is it? I, I don't know. I... Where'd she put it? - I, I don... Don't mess with me kid. Where's the money? It's, it's right here. Don't lie to me boy. Where's the rest of it? That's all I found! - That's all you found? I swear! - You swear? No son of mine is gonna lie to me. No! I knew he was gonna take that money. He's not usually alone for this long. It's not like this happens all the time. It was my friend's party... Social worker's gonna meet you in the ER at Providence. - Okay. Is he gonna be okay? Seems pretty tough. I think he'll be alright. February 24th. Today is his birthday. Happy birthday, kid. He can't go to the hospital. I don't have insurance. You're late. - So, I'm the boss. Well, it wasn't easy getting these seats, boss. Okay, so who's the target? Margaret Summerfield. Summerfield. The oil Heiress. Her portfolio lost 20 percent last year. Probably not to happy with Lavallee. Lavallee? Seriously? That guy's a dinosaur. You know what happens to dinosaurs? They die. They went extinct. - No, they died. Soft spots? Kids! - Seriously? She couldn't be into like saving the whales or something? Ms. Summerfield, good evening. How are you? Hello. I heard Lavallee lead you astray on renewables this year. Oh yes. Renewables were going to be the next internet. I warn my clients to stay away from them. Seems Lavallee's gotten a bit lazy. He's following fads. Mr. Matthews, I really don't think I... So, um, which of tonight's charities are you involved in Ms. Summerfield? My church, St. Andrews, Sponsors a summer camp for foster kids. Wait, Ken. Isn't that the camp you're volunteering for this summer? You are going to be a camp counselor? Um, yeah. I am. I love kids. I do. And it's actually gonna be the first summer... that I'm volunteering at the camp. I just find it to be of importance... to take time for the things in life that matter. It's so nice to meet someone in this business who realizes... that there are more important things in life than money. It sure is. We don't have room for another boy. Why do you do this to me? Yeah, this is Tammie. I noticed in your church bulletin... that you're looking for more male counselors... for camp this summer. My boss is really looking for a way to give back to the community. I'm hoping it's not too late. I believe his mother goes to your church. Great! Yeah, um, what's his name? Ken Matthews. She does. Beverly Matthews. You know, he'd have to work with a bunch of really rough kids. Oh, he loves kids. Adores them. Well we will send over an application and a background check. He's already missed the training... so he's gonna have to read the manual on his own. I will make sure he'll read every page. Okay good. Talk to you soon. Ken. Excuse me a second. So I got the kids from Locustwood here? Aha. Word about this one. History of attacking other kids. Dad has a restraining order. Mom just died of an overdose two weeks ago. That's why I asked him to come. Well, I just hope we don't have to send him back. Have faith Bonnie. Have faith. I know. Okay. Sam, it's good to be back at Pine Lake? Definitely No, no. Look, she needs to know I'm at camp. Her camp. Otherwise, this whole thing's a waste of time. Hey, Katelyn, I gotta go, alright? Alright. Hi there. I'm looking for the camp director, Tammie. You don't recognize me, do you? Tammie Parker, Bridgepoint High. Class of '99. Oh, I should remember you. Well... Wait, wait, wait. Tammie Parker? Wow. You used to be so, um... Fat? - Yes. No. What I meant to say was you look great. You didn't read the manual? I skimmed it, yeah. But then you missed the part about no cell phones or personal vehicles. Weren't you really into cars? Like, the only girl in auto shop? Yeah, weren't you supposed to be like a big rock star now? Yeah, well it looks like things turned out just fine for me, doesn't it? Why didn't you meet us at the church? No offense, but I'm not gonna ride up on the bus. Don't jerk me around, Ken. You're here to do a job. You're looking at the counselor of the year, okay? Sam. Reporting for duty. This must be our new recruit. And this is one of my best counselors. He's a retired Army Sergeant. He has a healthy respect for the rules. This is Ken Matthews. He's our new counselor. Show him the ropes? Yes ma'am. Glad to meet you. Grab your bag, soldier. Let's do it. Are you sure this is our cabin? Yeah, spruce cabin. We sure lucked out. It's one of the nicer cabin's up here. - Nicer? Yeah, it's real close to the bath house. We got the best shot at the hot showers before the water heater runs out. Wow. Fantastic. Plus, they did a better job of sealing this one off. So, we won't get so many of the critters inside. Critters? Tarantulas, snakes, the occasional rat. Rats? I ate one of those in basic. Tastes like chicken. That was a joke, soldier. A joke. Hey, Samuel. These kids. - Yeah? They're not normal. Right? You didn't read the manual? No I'm good. A bunch of namby pamby stuff, if you ask me. Here's what you need to know. You're not the foster parent or the caregiver. You're not the teacher. You're just here to help the kid have fun for one week. Easy enough. It's really not that hard if... You leave your life behind and you focus on your camper. Hey, Kaitlyn, what's up? We got a nibble from Summerfield. Alright, let's seal the deal. So let's not forget who's amazing idea this was. Make it happen, alright? I want a raise. Don't let Tammie see that. Come on, I'm gonna show you camp. Little R and R before the craziness begins? Yeah, I'm definitely a fan of that. Pete here's an airline pilot most of the year... but this week he's in charge of the pool. Right on man. Swimming already? Yeah, I like to open the pool for the counselors... before the kids get here. Great idea. I used to be a guard myself in high school. - Really? Yeah, yeah. Alright, I'm gonna go get my trunks, I think. So what I'm thinking is... Hey, no cell phones. - I'll just take it and put it over here. Hey, give me that back. Oh you girls wanna play? Let's play. I don't think that soldier really knows what he's gotten himself into. Where did you find this guy? Just keep an eye on him for me. Eat up. Only goes downhill from here. This is better than the chow they gave us in Baghdad. He's joking, right? It's amazing what you'll eat when you're hungry. Hey Everyone! Glad to see you're back. These kids have had rough lives... and this is our opportunity to share our hope with them. Couple of quick reminders. There are no cell phones around the kids, Lacee. All these new smartphones... They're just a temptation for the kids to steal them. Bonnie, dress code. - Okay. One piece bathing suits or cover-ups, ladies. I don't wanna see any of that cleavage or crack. Lacee. Alright, so without further ado... the moment we've been waiting for... camper assignments. Tammie? Alright. We've put a little bit of information... about each camper on the back of the card. Keep them with you as a reference. - Redford! What's the big deal with Redford? - Thinks he's an alien. Great kid. Alright, we're dismissed! Go get your cabins ready. We're gonna have a good week! Alright guys. I can't believe it's already been a year. Right? Ken! Come here, we're gonna say a prayer. Hold on, let me call you back. Let's pray that God helps us be a blessing to the kids this week, right? Not a praying man, Ken? Not exactly, no. Well, you might be by the end of this week. You're gonna love camp! There's a pretty good chance that my friends... the ones from out there, are gonna come. You mean aliens? Like in Beasts vs. Aliens? They're disgusting. Loser. Go away. What are you gonna do? Bite me like a girl? If I bite you, they'll send me back, retard. Who you calling a retard? Don't make me use the Vulcan death grip on you. You kidding me? There's camp! This place has a pool? Here they come. Here they come. Redford! Hey, good to see you. Hi! - Hi, are you Bella? I'm Bridget! Can we go swimming? Yes! I've been missing you. I've been missing you so much! Bella! - Elizabeth! Are they sisters? - Yes. Different foster homes. They only get to see each other at camp. Hi. Are you Maribel? Yeah. I'm your counselor, Lacee. That's why I have this sign with your name on it, silly. Oh, yeah! Silly! Let's go get you unpacked. Are you ready to have a great week? Yeah, come on! How was the bus ride over? Was it fun? Hey, what's your name. Eli. Hey Ken. Ken, this is your camper. Yo! Kid, what's up, my man? Screw you. What the hell was that? Looks like you got a runner, soldier. Is anybody gonna do anything? We're wondering the same thing about you. Pick it up, double time! Hey. Kid! Hey, honey, come on. Let's get off the bus. Where are we? Honey, we're at camp. What is that? They must not have told her where she was going. Oh. Sweetheart, you don't have to be scared. Camp is a place for kids to have fun. Come on. I'll walk with you. Come on, let's go have some fun, okay? He might be trying to contact the mothership. I don't think so, Red. Hey, get down from there. Come on! Hey! Kid, you can't just run off like that, okay? I'm your counselor, do you know what that means? It means you have to listen to me and do what I say. Okay? Alright, let's go unpack. Kid, do you understand me? I have a name. Everyone has a name. So? I hate you. Look you're really starting to push it. Okay? - Eli. I'm Samuel. This is my buddy Redford. Redford's been up here, what, like 3 times now, Red? Yes, sir. Tell you what. We can go unpack now, or... we can go see the stump first and unpack later. The stump? Really? Sweet! What do you say soldier? Fine, whatever. Come on. And here, camper's have been writing their names on it for over 25 years. My name's on it 3 times. One for every year I've been to camp. Isn't it awesome? I wouldn't go straight to awesome. You can tell how old it is by counting the rings. There's this thick one up here. Probably from when the tree got burnt during the second invasion from Talus Prime. You're weird. Thanks! Hey guys, I see you found the stump. And you must be Eli. Welcome to camp. You gonna sign your name? My counselor says my name isn't important. Okay. Hey Redford, nice to have you back. How has your year been? Sad to report no word from the mothership yet. Lame! - What are you talking about kid? That is quality entertainment. Thanks you guys. We're gonna be doing a lot of singing this week, so I hope you're ready. Remind me to tell you a story about this guy who was taken from his family. He was in and out of prison, but God had a special plan for his life. And he ended up working for the King of Egypt. I was taken from my sister. My dad's in prison. Is this the Joseph in the bible? I think we have some announcements right now. So, would you guys help me welcome Ms. Tammie, our fabulous camp director? First the rules. Oh, we only have two. Be safe, and have fun! And please do come to my tea party. Tea parties are for girls. Well, then I guess the girls are gonna get all the cookies. Samuel, how are we gonna get cookies? - We'll work something out. Oh, and a reminder, the variety show. I wanna see all your talents on the stage. Stupid kids. They don't have talent. - Hey, be nice. I think, um, I think that's it, right? The pool! Swimming! Swimming! - Pool! Pool! What? I can't hear you. The pool, That sounds like fun. - Lame. You're joking, right? Oh! Okay. Swimming! Yes, lifeguard Pete and I decided there's not gonna be any swimming this year. What do you think lifeguard Pete? - Hmm. Go to your cabins and put your suits on! The pool is open! Let's go guys! Hang on Redford, I got your sunscreen right here buddy. Alien snot, sweet! Doubles as a shield against photon rays. Let's go! Did you forget your swimsuit, stupid? No! I just don't wanna swim. What's your problem? You don't know how to swim? I can swim. What are you? Afraid of the water? Little chicken. Shut up! - Bock! Bock! Bock! Shut up! I know why you really don't wanna go swimming. That's enough, Amigo. Come on, lets hit the pool. Sissy! - Turd! Look kid, It's alright that you're afraid of the water. I was just teasing you. I told you I'm not afraid of water. Stop saying I am. What's your problem? You. Funny. Find your swim trunks, lets go. - Don't touch me! Look, all the other kids are down at the pool having a good time. Don't wanna miss out on that, do you? Go to hell. Get your swimsuit on now and lets go. You're serious kid? Alright guys listen up. There's only one way to get this arm band. You have to swim all the way across the deep end without any help whatsoever. So, who's gonna be the few, the brave? Who's gonna join the ranks of Pete's Ultimate Camp Swim Club? You can do this. I'm not sure. I will be cheering for you the whole way. But what if I don't make it? - You totally will. You are so strong, and I will be waiting for you on the other side when you finish. Ready? You're not gonna let me drown, are you? Not in my pool. Now, on the count of three. Okay, Bella. Ready? One. Two. Three. Yeah! Go Bella! Come on Bella! Yes! Yes! Ooh! Welcome to Pete's Ultimate Camp Swim Club! I've never won anything before. I am so proud of you! You got it girl! Hey Ken. - Hey. For the free planets of the delta quadrant! Oh my gosh! You got it. - I almost made it. Just keep working on it with Samuel. You'll get it. Where's Eli? - I told him to stay at the cabin. What? - You left him alone? The kid spit on me, okay? Whatever. There you are. Hey, the three of us need to have a talk. - Fantastic. Someone here needs to apologize. It's me. I really wanted you to come to camp, Eli, but we were short a counselor. So, Ken, even though he doesn't know how to be a good counselor... He came up to fill in. It's okay, I always get screwed. Okay. So how about this? No spitting, stick together, and camp will be great! Fine. I hear there's a kickball game happening. Why don't you two go down and play together before dinner? Don't leave him alone again. Alright Redford. Let's get on base buddy! Let's go! Who's up? Oh, I think it's me! Kick that sucker to Zenith! Nice! 5? You're Up! Eli's up! Alright Eli! Come on! Out! - What the hell, I was safe! Sorry Eli, you were out. Come on. No big deal. You were out. Figures you would take their side. Who's counselor are you anyway? Get off the field, kid. I told you, you were out. Even your counselor says so. I'm gonna count to five and you better be down here. Do you understand me? I know how to count to five. Well alright then. Here we go. One. Two. Three. Four. Five! - Fine! Stay up there. See if I care. I got all night. Hey soldier. Serellian Wamba Beast Liver! Yes! I'm starved! Kid, you can't run off like that, okay? I was hungry. Wow! You swam all the way across the deep end? Isn't she awesome? Hey, I want one of those. Sorry kid. Only brave little boys who can swim and obey their counselor get one. Hey, maybe you should trade your phone in for one. The one you've been texting on all day? Give it up, kid. Come on, get me one! What kind of a stupid counselor are you? Look, you want an arm band? You have to swim, okay? Can't believe I have to put up with this food for the next four days. Bon apetite! They look like alien brains and fingers mashed up all together! That's disgusting. Can I have some? Did you look through your other bag? Like three times! Man, where is it? Hey Samuel, here to relieve you. - Jimbo. Well, as soon as you guys get settled in your bunks, we can start the story time. Sweet! Do you have any UFO stories? Hey, kid, what's that whole mess you're making up there? Alien defense. I don't want them sneaking up and sucking out my intestines. I see. Ready for a story now. Here it is! It's in Eli's bag, he took it! Whatever, you probably just put it there. Why did you take it? - He's always taking stuff at Locustwood. Not again, man. I am getting tired. Let's go soldier, double time! Is it safe to come out yet? There we are, said Mrs. Puddleduck, good as new. She opened the shutters and let the warm sunlight spill into the cozy room. Charlotte could smell the roses growing in the garden just below. Mrs. Puddleduck looked lovingly at Charlotte and said... Just come to me everyday and let me remind you how much I care. Alright, story time is over. Time for bed. No, no! I don't wanna go to bed. Can we read another story, please? No, we're gonna have a long day tomorrow. You've got to get some sleep. Come on, into bed! I'm not tired, can we go for a walk, Bridget? Please? You almost fell asleep on the floor Bellie Boo... and I can barely keep my eyes open myself. Come on. No, no! I don't wanna go to bed. Let's stay up, please, please! It's okay, It's okay Bella. Bella, It's okay. Bella, you're safe here. You're okay. Nothing is going to hurt you. He'll come here too. He will. Bridget, can you move your bed next to hers? Um, yeah. How about that? Look, she's gonna put her bed right next to yours. Look how close. Better? My magic blanket! Magic blanket? Almost forgot that I brought it. Okay. My great grandmother made it. It's pretty. Come here. My grandma made this, not only with stitches and cloth... but with all of her love. Here. Read what it says. Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. Guard me Jesus through the night and wake me with the morning light. You know, I don't really use it that much anymore. You wanna borrow it? Really? - Mmm. It is magic. Leave me alone. I give up. Ken. Go! These are the only shoes they sent Gabby up with, and they're two sizes too small. I let her borrow my flip flops. I'll have Pete go in to town first thing. Size? Five. So it begins. Yeah. Sam. - Randy took Bryce's stuff over to Cabin 5. What'd the nurse say about the bite? Thankfully, it didn't break the skin. What about those two? What are you thinking? I hate to admit I was wrong. I should have known. Eli's social workers wanted us to send him back if he got violent. I'm gonna have to send them both back. Give them one more day. I can't risk the entire camp for them. Look Sam, a lot can happen in a day. Then he runs again, yeah. Yeah, I think she gave me the worst kid here on purpose. Hey, I got to go but as soon as you get that meeting, let me know. Okay? Alright, bye. So, how was your first day? Thanks for the troubled kid. What's wrong with him? Nothing. Nothing? Is there anything here but junk food? There's some apples in fridge. - Excellent. So, what's up with your freak kid? Robert. Redford. Yeah, seriously? What's that kid, like 10 years old? He is already in some need of serious therapy. You know... I wonder if these kids here wouldn't benefit more... from a bunch of psychs rather than us. Right? The first day can be pretty hard. Yeah, no kidding! My kid had me run probably 20 miles around this place today. It's gonna take a month's worth of chiropractic work to fix my neck. Hey Randy, how long did you say you've been doing this again? Three years. Glutton for punishment? You know, I thought you had the worst kid but obviously Tammie has it out for me. You know what I think? - Time to go! Hey man, take it easy! Don't easy me! Now you listen and you listen good, maggot. You may be good at making money in your pretty little office... but I have been to hell and back. I've killed in service and I've watched my buddies bleed to death from lED's. Camp is a walk in the park compared to war, you non-contributing zero. When I think back to my army days it gets me all worked up. Believe me, when your under fire in a war zone, you think of the oddest things. Wayne was the only person who told me he loved me, ever. Wayne? My counselor, from this camp. I was a mean, violent, nasty kid. Hated everyone, especially Wayne. Must have bit him like 20 times. When I left camp, he told me he loved me. And I spit on him when I got on the bus. Tried to find him when I got out of the service. He had died the year before. Never got a chance to tell him: Thanks for changing my life. So, I don't care if you don't like the food, or me, or camp. You will figure out a way to be a good counselor to that kid. You get me? Figure it out. How many times do I have to tell you to stay in your room? No mom, no! Ken! Who the hell is calling me at 3am? What do you want? Dad? Eli? What are you doing? Where are you? I'm at camp at Pine Lake. Camp? What are you doing at camp? I don't know. They made me come here. My counselor's awful and the food is worse than Locustwood. Alright, don't worry. I'm coming to get you. No dad. Never mind. I'm okay, I'm fine. I said I'm coming to get you! No dad, no. What time is it? - Time to get up, princess. Eek! Call that beauty sleep? You might wanna try something else. Eli, rise and shine soldier! Where's my phone? You're not supposed to have a phone. Funny kid. Have you seen it? No. Are you sure you haven't seen it? Oh, here it is. I thought I plugged it in. Check your messages later. We've got to get moving. Redford, if you don't get up... we're not going to make it to Muddy Creek before breakfast. Muddy Creek! Crawdads! That's right, soldiers. The early bird gets the... crawdad! Does he really have to strip right here in front of everyone? Where else is he gonna change? I'm not changing till everyone leaves. That might be a problem, see, cause we can't leave until you change clothes. Seriously kid, we're all boys. It doesn't matter if we see each other in our underwear. Eli, come on. Hold on a second, Sam. What do you think? Fine, whatever. Alright then. Hurry up. Come on. Find your pants. All the good fishing spots are right out here. There's gonna be some really great crawdads right over there, okay? If you're waiting for it to dry it's gonna be a long wait. If you find any leeches, soldier, you let me know. Leeches? Seriously? They'll be attached to your toes. Leeches, great. Oh, looks like you got one soldier! That's what I'm talking about. See this crawdad, they look like these creatures I've seen on my home planet. This is your home planet, stupid. No it isn't. I'm from Zenith. Don't call me a liar. You've insulted Zenithians for the last time! Hey, come on guys! Good one, Ken! I like the new look! Oh, you haven't heard? Mud does great things for your complexion. Come on down, I'll show you. No, no. Thanks, I'm good. Are the crawdads biting? Oh yeah, they're definitely some kind of alien creatures. They like raw meat. Oh bacon! - I've never seen so much bacon! So, Bella and I are gonna go to aunt Tammie's tea party. What do you think, kid? Wanna join them? What? - The tea party's for girls. Right. Eli, wanna go swimming today? I already told you, no swimming. Hey, the water's not gonna hurt you. Besides, you know, it's hot out. Take a dip... - No swimming, okay? Okay. Okay, mister party pooper. We'll just stay in the cabin all day and do nothing. Sound fun? Turn it off, put it away, keep it away. Look, I've got an important prospective client. It could be worth a lot, so... Okay. Well, remember Eli, your camper? He's important too. I know. I'm aware I suck at this, okay, but I'm trying to do better today. We did the whole get in the mud thing. You're mean to him. He's mean to me. He's ten! - So? Put the phone away... and maybe you'll be able to keep track of your camper. Remember? We've got to stick together, alright? Sure sounds like the kids are having fun over there at the pool? You know, I used to be a lifeguard. It would be like you had your own personal lifeguard. I told you, I'm not afraid of water. You know, that's sure what it sounds like to me, kid. I'm not a liar! I hate you! Here, let me help you. No, no, no, not like that. Can't you... I've just never done it before. It's not that hard. Can't you just take the arrow and... I've never done it before. Neither have these kids either, okay? You know what, just forget it! Wow! I wanna ride the bikes! We can ride the bikes. Let's go check it out. No we can't. - Sure we can. Look, there's plenty left. Look, there's a purple one right there, you want that one? It looks about your size. I don't know how. What do you mean? They said I'm too fat to ride one. Gabby, do you know what today is? What? Today's the day, you're gonna learn how to ride a bike! Really? - Aha. Let's go! Can we grab that one please? Alright, come on. Got it? Alright, you got this. Gabby. You're okay? Gabby! I'm okay! - Oh, good. Can I try again? - Of course you can, come on! Look, kid. I didn't mean to... - Whatever, okay? Okay, okay. You don't wanna swim. You don't like archery. You don't wanna go to the tea party. What would you like to do instead? Shoot, anything. I'm up for it, tell me. I wanna go to the other side of the lake. I don't think they allow that, kid. Why don't we do something back here at camp instead, okay? Figures. You said it but you don't mean it. That's not fair and you know I... You said it! You just lie like everyone else. We should go back to the cabin now. Look what I got! Made from alien skin. Pretty sure he swallowed half the pool but he made it! Hey, let me see that. No, it's mine! - Hey. Not a nice way to treat your fellow soldiers. Can we just go back to the cabin now? I hate it here. Back to the cabin. Figures, I get the kid wants to do something we can't even do. He wants to hike a mile away. Where? Come on. Looks like we're going for a hike now. Why don't you try to talk to him? Yeah, I don't really feel like going for a hundred yard dash again, but thanks. Why do you think he runs? Because he likes being a pain? Try again, soldier. Man, all I know is he's testing my patience. He is testing you to see if you give a damn, because no one else does. How is it going? I just wanna get away from that stupid camp. Yeah, no kidding. I think you're right about the tea party. That would be pretty lame. Sounds lame. What do they even do there anyway? I don't know. We'd have to go to find out. They do have treats though. Yeah, but you've got to dress up. Girl stuff. It sucks not having an arm band. Yup. Gotta get into that pool. You know, you could really get me one, if you wanted to. You suck. Hopeless. You know what, kid? Finally! The mothership has come back for me! Take me home! Take me home! These mountain storms pass really quickly. It'll be sunny again tomorrow. That's the closest the mothership has come yet. Sucks, soldier? They'll come back for me, someday. Why don't we check our mail? Hey, did I get a letter from my dad? Got something here from Tammie for you. No thanks. Alright, here you go Bella. Here you go Maribel. You can open those, Maribel. I'm saving them. You'll get more tomorrow, go ahead and read them. I don't like reading. Don't like reading? Everyone likes reading their letters. Lacee. Maybe she's not that good at it. What? Reading. Oh. Maribel, can we talk? What grade are you in at school, sweetie? My mom, my mom didn't like taking me to school. I have an idea. Can I read your letters to you? Dear Maribel... You rocked it on the kickball field today soldier. You can be on my team anytime. Sergeant Sam. Read this one. Dear Maribel... You are so much fun to hang out with here at camp. Tomorrow, we get to do the tea party. You are going to be so beautiful in one of the dresses. I can't wait to see which one you pick. I am so lucky to have you as a camper this week. You wrote that one! Yeah, I did. Do you wanna read more? - Yeah. Red, turn that thing off and go to sleep soldier. I can't find my alien band. You're not supposed to take it off. It was itchy Here it is! No, wait! That one's not yours. I found it. What do you mean, you found it? Wait a minute. You took my alien band because it's made of alien skin... and you wanna be an alien, like me. Admit it. Look, there's no such things as aliens, you freak. Guys! No mothership, no Zenith, and we eat spaghetti for lunch. Not alien guts. No one is ever coming for you. Never, ever, ever. Hey, what are you doing? Hold this, sweetie. How do you feel? I've had worse. Well, you certainly took it like a champ. Samuel, is it true? What's that? The aliens aren't coming for me. Hey, you don't give up hope. You hear me? Don't give up hope. You and these stupid arm bands. Why can't you stop taking what's not yours? I didn't. Oh really? Well, somehow it magically ended up on your bed then. I wonder how. Nothing to say? Yeah, figures. You know, with all your running away and stealing things... you are making me look like a bad counselor. That's because you are a bad counselor. No, you know what? You are bad, you. Let me exp... - Just wait here. So when do I go back? We can't have kids beating the other kids up. Do you understand? Ken hasn't been the best counselor? Ken's the worst counselor ever. Okay. Tell you what. I'll give you a second chance... if you think you can give Ken a second chance. Okay. Good. Come on, get in bed. Up. Up, up, up. Ms. Tammie? Yup? Will you tell Redford I'm sorry. I will. Goodnight Eli. Well, when's he going back? - What? When is he going home? - Shh! Ken. Is that what you want? Tammie, If we're not careful I may end up... we may end up getting sued by Redford's parents. What parents? His dead mom or his drug dealer dad? You know, look. You can't just throw out right and wrong okay? The kid has broken every single rule and there needs to be consequences. In Eli's world, right and wrong, they tend to get a little bit muddled. And if the adults in his life can't tell the difference, how can we expect him to? Alright. So forgive me if I have a little bit of compassion here. But please, don't you worry. Nobody's gonna complain that Eli's counselor doesn't give a care. I am trying to care, Tammie. But that kid is totally screwed up. I can't do this. I mean, how do you like a kid like that? You just have to find one thing to like. Just one thing. And pray for him. All these kids could use our prayers. Alright, okay. Well, for example... there's one thing I like about you. Really? Porsche Carrera 4. 330 horsepower. 0 to 60 in 5.2 seconds. Be still my beating heart. Nice. Girls don't like boys, they like cars and money. Okay, goodnight Ken. Goodnight. And Joseph told his brothers, who had sold him to be a slave... that what they meant for evil... God used for good for his entire family. Amen. Well, my friend Pete has an announcement to make. So Pete, would you come on up? Great news! Yesterday at the pool... four more campers joined the hundred year tradition... of Pete's Ultimate Camp Swim Club! So, if the club is 100 years old, how old does that make you? Please stand and raise your bands high! Way to go guys! Really good! Can you get me one of those arm bands? - You know I can't. Buy one, steal one. You could do it if you were a good counselor. Come on, I wanna show you something. We can't just leave. Who's gonna stop us? It's great just knowing I'm a part of God's family, playing under the sun. This is your car? No way! - Yes way. You wanna get in it? - Yes! Come on. Hop in, dude. Whoa! How did you get this? Well, I didn't steal it, or trick someone. I worked really hard for it. If you want something bad enough, you'll do almost anything for it. You really want that wrist band, right? - Yeah. Look, I may be a lousy counselor, but I am a great swimmer. And I can teach you to swim across that pool faster than anybody. But, I don't wanna swim. Yeah, yeah, yeah and you aren't afraid of water, blah, blah blah. We only have a few days left here at camp... and it's gonna take time for me to teach you how to swim. So what are we gonna do? Eli. Let's be honest. We don't really like each other or get along too well, do we? But there is one thing I like about you, dude. You're a fighter. A real fighter. And if you really want that wristband, you're gonna have to fight for it. Whatever is keeping you out of the water... you've got to fight it. Hey. Give me your towel. Just go for it. On three we jump in together, okay, Eli? Okay. One. Two. Three. Come here. Come here. Whoa! Fancy. The tea party is this afternoon. That's what I hear. Did you know? You know... about Eli? I try not to think about their past too much. I focus on a hopeful future. Hey you! You were awesome in the pool today! I think you won, like, every chicken fight? Hey, why are you wearing that dress? I'm gonna a tea party. I know, I know, it's just for girls. Okay, well we are off. Enjoy your tea party. - I shall. Hey, do me a favor. Hold on to this for me. Come on! - Eli, wait up buddy! We totally dominated that pool. That was so awesome. You see, I told you it would be fun. How was I supposed to know? First time in a pool. Hey. Come on. What do you wanna do now? Cookies do sound good right now. I wish I didn't have to get dressed up for that tea party. My lovelies, thank you for coming to my tea party. Welcome, welcome! You all look beautiful! Bella, you look absolutely smashing in that dress. Thank you Miss Tammie. And those flowers in your hat, they are marvelous. Thank you for noticing. You ladies all have such great manners. The gardener just has... We heard you had good tea? A little birdie told us this is a black tie event. You look dashing! Please sit, join us, join us! Hello, ladies. Ladies, let's have a toast, shall we? To our first gentlemen tea guests. Now remember our manners. When in doubt. Pinkies out. Cheers. To the ladies. Mmmmm. Delicious. What do we owe the pleasure of your company? Oh, we're here for the cookies. Oh, please! All of them! Go! Go! Go! Operation cookie rescue! Leave no cookie behind! All of them! All of them! Let's go! I'm gonna get you, Redford! Feast on the spoils of our ravages! Who got the most girls? Who got the most girls? I think I did! Hey, Miss Tammie. Way to go! Yeah! Whoa! Go on, kick your feet, kick your feet. You got it, you got it! You're doing it! Ladies, we have mail. Bella, something for you. Maribel. You did a great job on the swim test. Welcome to the club, Lifeguard Pete. And we have one here for Tammie from Porsche. Who's Porsche? Obviously Ken. Ha, ha, ha. Well, I don't know, but let's find out. My heart throb Tammie, Let's go for a ride. We can ditch that guy named Ken who normally drives me. With all my horsepower, Porsche. Gabby, let's hear one of yours. Yeah! Hey Gabby, I hear you're gonna sing for us tomorrow at the variety show. So excited to hear your voice, James. You're singing in the show tomorrow? Yes. - And it's gonna be awesome! Camp is awesome, my counselor is cool! Is it a 5 of diamonds? He's got everyone there, in his hands. He's got everyone, everywhere in his hands. He's got the whole world in his hands. What a great show! Do we wanna have some more fun? Yes! We have one more act and I'm pretty sure you guys are gonna love it. You see, one of our camp counselors this week... is actually a very talented musician. In fact, he was in a real rock band. Ken? You were in a rock band? A long time ago. Where did you get those? Your mom donated them to the church rummage sale, come on! I didn't tell her she could get rid of them! Come on you guys, you want to hear some rock and roll or what?! Yeah! Ken! Ken! Ken! Are you gonna play? Sure looks that way. Just promise not to run away if I suck, alright? Just pretend you're back in high school. Alright, as long as you do the same. - Oh I will. Oh, hush up! One, two, three four. Thank you, thank you, thank you. How did you get to be a drummer? Well, umm.. Okay. So, I always wanted a drum set. Ever since I was like, this big. And, um, my parents didn't like the drums. And I got really mad. At my dad mostly. And when I was twelve... my dad, he died. I never met my parents. My dad's in prison. Life doesn't always work out the way it should, I guess. But, before my dad died... he did get me these drums as my birthday present. That is a sweet birthday present. Yeah, they're pretty cool, right? For a while, I was angry at my dad for dying. I played the drums a lot then. I practiced to much the neighbors actually... called the cops on me for making too much noise. I guess I was trying to prove something to myself. To my dad. My father never told me he loved me. But he got me these drums. Right? Well, enough out of me. Hey, you guys ready to rock?! Yeah! You really got these for your birthday? Yep. I hope I get a birthday present someday. What do you mean? You never got a birthday present before? My mom said I never deserved one. Wow, um. That's lame. Tell me about it. Why are you here? Well, um. - It's for her. Who's her? - Tammie. Oh, that her. She's a severe hottie. You think so? Out of your league. Yeah, you're probably right - Hell, yeah, I'm right! You know, um... It's not important why I'm here. What matters... What? What matters is that I'd be your counselor any day. Hey, you wanna try these out? Really? - Yeah, take the sticks. It's real easy. You cross your right hand over your left hand. Okay, here you go. One, two. One, one, two. Take a stab at it. Not bad, man. Not bad. You know my mom is dead? Like your dad? No, I didn't know that. She was the meanest person. She never let me go out of my room. She wanted to be with her boyfriends. She made me hide when they came over. She didn't like it when I talked to other kids. She hated me. Well, I hate you mom, I hate you! Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. Hey' it's okay. He's just a little upset. Hey Eli. The other kids are making s'mores. Wanna come get some? What are s'mores? Oh they're just the most delicious dessert. All marshmallows and chocolate all melted together. They're really quite exquisite. Sure. - Come on. Yeah, yeah, go on, go on. I wanna go for the armband tomorrow. Yeah. You're gonna get it. No problem. I, I have to help out with the s'mores, but um... this is for Porsche. Are we gonna get in trouble being out here? I won't tell if you don't. So, you were pretty obsessed with me in high school? I mean you did buy my old drums from my mom. Your mom donated them! You kept them. Well I did like your band. Oh, gosh, I can't imagine what you thought of me that night! I should have been flattered, I... Why did you ask me out on stage? In front of everybody? Okay, because my friend dared me to do that. Yeah, and you could have let me down a little bit, you know, smoother. Yeah, that wasn't one of my classier moments, was it? Well, I do hope that me giving you a ride in my car tonight... helps to soothe some of those high school wounds. It doesn't. You want me to tell you what does? - Yeah, please do. You teaching Eli how to swim. He really likes you. So what happens next? You mean when he goes back to his world and we go back to ours? Yeah. That. It's hard. So what do you do? I pray that God will watch over them. Yeah. Not me. Not you? I prayed, when I was a kid. I asked Him for things. And he didn't answer? No, no. He answered. He let my dad die. He didn't save him from cancer. I'm sorry. Yeah, I haven't talked to God much since then. God can love us no matter what our situation. That means, it's whether we can feel it, or not. And that's what you tell these kids here? I hope you're right about Him. Me too. Do you wanna get into some more trouble? Come on. Hey Roy! This isn't what it looks like. Yes it is! I don't even wanna know. Keep kicking! Come on Eli! Yeah! You did it! You did it, Eli! That was amazing! I thought I wasn't gonna make it. I'm so proud of you, kid. Really. See, you're a real fighter. Dad? Hey! Get you're hands of my kid. Who's this guy... - Get your damn hands off my kid! No, dad, I didn't mean for you to come. Shut up boy, you called me. I'm taking you home. Bonnie, get the kids out of here, now! Let's get him to the nurses station. Keep touching him and I'll kill you! Shut up, dad! Shut up! Somebody call the cops. Get off me! Hey Jenny. What's going on here? What happened? His father showed up. Just leave me alone. You don't have to be embar... - Just leave, just leave. Okay, buddy. I'll be outside, alright? It's gonna hurt a little bit, okay? Anybody wanna tell me what that was about? He's pushing you away - What? We're friends. I mean, I don't get it. I have to call Locustwood. I wanna know, how did he even know he was here? I don't think it was Locustwood. What do you mean? He said something about Eli calling him. Eli can't call him. Eli doesn't have access to a... Three thirty in the morning? Do you know this number? No, no I don't know that number. See, this is why we don't allow cell phones here. How do you know Tammie's aunt? What are you talking about? Margaret Summerfield. You've got a bunch of missed calls from her. She's a huge financial supporter of our camp. Why is my aunt calling you? She's umm... She's been in the market for a new financial advisor... and I found out that she's... - No, just... Tammie, Tammie. Hey. Hey. Wait a minute. Let me explai... Are you serious?! That's why you wanted to come to camp? You used me. You used these kids. For my great aunt's money? Look, I did not come to camp initially... Well, it looked worse than it was. No stitches, so he should be good to go. Hey buddy, look. You got your arm band. It's your fault! Go follow him! No. No. This isn't right. What did you expect? That years of pain would somehow magically disappear in a week? That you could fix him in a couple of days? You're just gonna give up on him now? Great. My fish is gonna be bigger than your entire head. It's gonna jump out of the boat. - Mine's gonna be bigger. Ours is gonna be bigger. Come on. Hey, look who made dinner. Where's Ken? We haven't seen him. Good. We'll keep an eye on him. Hey sweetie, you don't wanna lose this. Eli. You want something to eat? Look, Eli. Bothean tree worms. Delicious and Nutritious. Shut up, freak. Do you wanna do anything, Eli? Our last activity for the week. No. Crawdads, Canoes? What do you say, soldier? I wish I never came. Come on, chin up. Camp Pine Lake! Are you ready to have a party? Because my friend Eli's never had a birthday party before... and I thought today would be a great day to celebrate it. What do you think? You came back? Happy Birthday, Eli. It's my birthday? It's my birthday party! Hey Red, this is my birthday party! And what would a birthday party be without presents? Presents? Here's one for you, Luke. Oh, wait, and here's one for Bella. Yay! And Redford - Sweet! And for Gabby... A bicycle! And for Jose. You know what? Wait a second. I think I have birthday presents here for everybody! And something extra special for Eli. They go with the drums. Drums? Are you serious? Happy birthday, buddy. Happy Birthday. 0h yeah! It's been a pleasure serving with you this week, soldier. Feels a lot longer than that. Don't make any promises you can't keep. They've had more than enough of that in their lives. Oh, and uh, bring your shades. Well, I guess I can't put this off forever. Don't cry, soldier. The mother ship will come soon and I'll be able to go back home. Hey, Mandie? - Yeah? I think I forgot to be sad this week. That's good! That's so good. Here. Bridget helped me write this letter for you. Hey kid. You're okay? No. Am I gonna see you? After I leave this place? I don't know. Can you promise me we'll see each other again? I can promise you one thing. I'll never forget you. I love you, Eli. I'm gonna ask God to watch out for you. You understand? Okay kids, on to the bus. Okay, get on the bus. Bye sweetheart! Keep your head up! Bye guys! - We love you. I love you, Bella! Bye! You miss Lacee? It's okay, where are you going? West County Home for Girls. I've been there once. It's not so bad. They have a really nice playground. Here, take this. You'll get your own next year, but until then, you can borrow mine. Thanks. We had the best counselors. My favorite part of camp was when we got caught in the rain. What was yours? The drums. That was sweet too. Hey Red? - Yeah? Tell me about your home planet. I come from the Planet Zenith... where everything is made of gold and everyone is purple. The diameter of the planet is 63 miles by 63 miles. Hey. - Hey. So the counselor's bus is getting ready to leave... and I still have some cleaning up to do. Would you mind giving me a lift off the mountain? You did really great this week. Seriously, thanks for coming. Tell me. Well, I've started talking to God again. And, I've been asking Him why He lets them suffer like this. I ask the same thing all the time. And? And I don't know. I mean, maybe He can use the suffering for good. Like he used Jesus' suffering to help all of us. And that makes you feel better? No. It gives me hope. Well, I was hoping for a little bit more than hope. It's hard to go back. Yep. For the whole week, I couldn't wait to go back to my real life, you know? And now I feel like my real life is fake, and camp is real. Kinda weird. Man, that kid could run. You know? He could run. Will I ever see Eli again? Pray for him. Not quite so intimidating when I'm sober? Eli writes me letters. Talks a lot about camp and his counselor. When you become a dad, you uh... The thing is, I... The only example I had was my dad. He didn't exactly help me out. You know? Hey, it's okay. No, it's not okay. It's not okay! I'm a failure as a father! Eli's gonna have no dad to help him out. He's gonna get screwed, just like I got screwed. I talked to my attorney. He wrote this up. I know. It's a lot to ask. Eli doesn't have a lot of options.
