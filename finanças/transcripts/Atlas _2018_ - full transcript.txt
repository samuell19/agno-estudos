Hands off my TV. It stays here. Do we have to call the police? Vultures... Before you all black out on me... Don't forget the eviction on the 27th. 49, Friedrich Ablass Street. Anyone who doesn't show: find a new job, clear? So... - Merry Christmas. - Where are our presents, boss? Fell off the sleigh. I'm throwing you out in an hour. Stop... Look... Turns four tomorrow. She'll get her first bike. Cute. Wanna see? Real sweet. Here, look. Enjoy it as long as she's still little and her mom isn't giving her shit about you yet. You're still her nice, strong daddy now. Know when my daughter calls me? When the cash isn't on her account on time. Let it go, Alfred. You think she remembers what I gave her for her 4th birthday? As if! It's OK, Alfred. I don't even remember. What? Her birthday... what I gave her... - This is your new colleague. - Hi, I'm Moussa. This is Mirko. Henning. Thorsten. Mark. That's Walter. Don't be fooled by his age. He'll haul more than any of these morons. And that's Alfred, our faithful legal aide. Bailiff. - I get it. - Yeah. Alright, get to work. Moussa, over here. Good morning. I hope you're all packed. - Let me get my husband. - You do that. Thanks. Goodbye. - Morning, Mr. Hoppe. - Stop filming me. - I do what I want in my place. - It's not your place any more. - Yes, it is. - Here, the eviction order. And here's the enforcement order. We have full authorization to clear the apartment. You came in vain, Mr. Hoppe. The eviction order was repealed four days ago. There. I don't understand... It's complex, I mean: two letters, two contradictory statements. Check your mailbox more often, maybe? Go ahead, make that call. Stop that now! - You can all go home. - Are you deaf? Put it down. - And you are... Your name, please. - Put it down. Yeah, I'd like your name... What the... Julia, call the police. I'm reporting you. - Yeah? Who are you reporting, punk? - Enough! - You outta your mind? - Come outta there! Move it! Out! All out! You fell for him. He'll report you. No way. The problem with guys like you is you do as you please. But you gotta play by the rules. If that's too tough for you, there's the door. Here, to get you back on level... Don't mess with me. Or what? Roland... Did some law but never good enough for a degree. I know the type. Go ahead, tell Roland the stunt our desert prince pulled. What happened, Walter? The new guy's a loose cannon. It makes me look bad, Roland. I vouch for the movers I commission. And I need to be able to count on you! It can happen, it's not my fault. It's the holidays. Some letters take longer. Are you shitting me? The tenant gets the letter, but you don't? - It happens. - But it can't! I told them the building's empty by year's end. - You've put me in deep shit! - What do you want me to do? You fucked it up. Do something! Move your ass. Did you see that, Daddy? Did you see it, Daddy? RETURN TO SENDER Hello? Someone open a window. Henning, look... Well, now... Yummy... Look how hungry you are... Congratulations. As if you didn't have enough problems already. - Rex is a good boy. - What did you call the mutt? - Rex. It says on his collar. - Rex. It means "king". King? How can you call your dog "king", man? What's the matter with you people? Well Happy New Year, ladies, and don't let the king poop in my garage. So what does your name mean "Moussa"? I'm sure it means something. It's your custom, right? - Moussa means "the son". - "The son". Pretty creative guy, your dad. You know, "the son"... Unlike "the daughter"... What now, you cunt? Why aren't you laughing? From now on you just keep your mouth shut, got it? Yeah. I'm stuck. Why can he get away with that? Because he's an Afsari. They're Kurds, or Arabs, or who knows what they are... Big time scumbags, doing the real dirty deals. So, they give Roland their dirty money. He buys a building, cheap, throws everybody out, sells it at triple price, and the Arabs get a pile of clean cash back. Thanks. But Roland can't vacate the place cause one little rat won't come out of its hole. So Roland's getting cold feet. This thing is out of his league. Those guys... they don't throw stones in windows, or slash tires. They're different. They play a different ball game. They're sick. Wackoes. And Roland works for them now. And our Mr. Fatso just did three years for manslaughter. So who in his right mind would hire a guy like that? Now, mark my words: As long as that lunatic is in the company, I'm not giving Roland a single job anymore. He can go find another sucker. We're heading for deep shit, believe me. - To each his own. - What? We all carry the weight we brought upon ourselves. We all have to carry it on our own. Did you come up with that all by yourself? While schlepping the stuff? - Get out, Mr. Grone! - Mr. Haller, please... Don't make a big mistake, you've got to go sooner or later... Not now, I don't. Take your foot out of my door. - Mr. Haller... - Take your foot out of my door! Dad! It's OK. Daddy's here. - Are you OK? - Yes. Scumbags! Thank you. Is that yours or mine? Mine, I guess... - I'm calling an ambulance. - That's not necessary. This is Jan Haller. We just got attacked in front of my house. 49, Friedrich Ablass Street. Someone got hurt, please send an ambulance. I don't need an ambulance. Yes, 49. - No need to be afraid anymore. - Thanks. Police will be right here. You can wait inside if you like. - I've got to go. - The police will be right up. The precinct isn't far, please stay. - I really must go. - Listen, I need you as a witness. Besides, I'd like to make it up to you. I'm Jan. Walter. Tomorrow? C'mon, please... At seven. Got plans? Sometimes I envy you. No family. No responsibility. No worries. I filled up the van, the garage is locked... - Gotta go. - Walter... You're the only one I can rely on around here. Just wanted you to know. Tyler? Tyler? Put it back. I'm Walter... - Your husband... - Walter, yes... I'm Julia. Come on in. Jan's not back yet, should be any second. Thanks, so nice of you. I'll go find a vase. Karl? Look, it's Walter, a friend of Daddy's. Here... Smashed in the wall, just like that... "An accident", they say. So we cut the rent. Big mistake. So they terminated the lease. We've been living in this construction site for a year now. But they're not even renovating. They just want us out, so they can sell for five times the price. They want to wear us out. All our neighbors gave up, took the money and ran. But what good is that bit of money if it happens again in your next place? This is our home. You don't just give that up, do you? I'm sorry for being such a whiner. But all this just makes me so angry. I understand. Who does something like that? How can they live with it? Great that you came! I'm sorry I'm late. But I had to explain tenancy law to our lawyer again. No worries. What's that? It's for Karl. For Karl? That's so nice of you. - Open it later, maybe. - No way, I want to see this! It's huge. - I don't know what to say. - No need to, it's Karl's, after all. Have a look. It's for you. From Walter. - What do you say? - Thank you. Not to me... - It's fine. - Thank you. - Here you go. - Thanks. And this, for you... Tweet, tweet, tweet We all love each other sweet. So now let's eat! - Enjoy... - Yep, Walter, that's the routine here. - Are you from the neighborhood, Walter? - Sossenheim. Quite a stretch. You here by car? - No, public. - Oh boy. Connections aren't the best. I'm a nurse. On night shifts, it's a nightmare. What brought you here last night? - I wanted to visit my son. - Karl, stop it, please. Karl... C'mon... If you're not hungry you can get up, but no playing with your food, clear? Do you like it, Walter? - Please, be honest. - No, it's really good. Fine. Have you noticed we're the last ones in the building? Jan, I already told him. - At least while we're eating, OK? - Sure. So, what do you do, Walter? - I'm a... - You're bleeding. I'm sorry. - I'll go get bandages. - No, it's just a scratch. The men with the stones did that. What? Look at me. You saw that? No need to be afraid. Karl, if you're full, you can go play. Shoo... - He couldn't really see it. - Later. Nothing happened to him. - You lied to me, Jan. - Because I knew you'd react like that. So now you have to lie so I won't worry? No. The boy wasn't hurt, dammit. And he wouldn't have been. You oughta know I'm the last to want my son in a situation like that. Maybe we should've just taken the money. Are you serious? Yes. I'm sorry. I'll go check on Karl. We have an officer on our case now. Name's Yilmaz. Good man. It'd be a big help if you told him what you saw. You'd have to drop by. Surely no longer than 10 minutes. I wouldn't recognize those men. No need to. It'd be fine if you told him what you saw. I can't help you with that. I know it's none of my business, but may I ask, why? I'm getting some bandages, you're bleeding to death. No. I'll take care of it. - Morning. - Morning. Morning. I'll cut to the chase. A report's been filed against the company concerning the failed eviction. The tenant reported one of us for assault and property damage. The police will summon you all individually. You'll all go and testify in favor of your colleague. Nasty little runt. That "nasty little runt" can get us fucked big time. I just don't get how anyone can act so dumb in front of a rolling camera. - Alfred will tell you all what to say. - Roland... I swear the guy'll shut his mouth soon. This is between him and me. He'll shut up. You won't do a thing. Are we clear? That son of a bitch'll shut up when I'm through with him, I swear. Son of a bitch. Roland, I can't go there. C'mon, Walter, it's not about you. It's about the Arab. Thirty years. No one's after you anymore. I already went. Short and sweet. They want to take away my license. Go right ahead. Least I won't be everybody's dump anymore. Roland'll find something for me. I've been working with Roland for 15 years now. Longer than my marriage lasted. Picture that. I'll head inside. Why didn't you help me? When Moussa attacked me. You just watched. Nevermind. Fuck him. Come on, Rex. I was at the truck the whole time. You're not the first not wanting to testify against this clan. But you do realize perjury is a criminal offense? So you weren't at the apartment? Let's say Mr. Haller sees a picture of you... He wouldn't recognize you because you weren't there. Right? I was at the truck. Please, come in. Keep your coat on. Heating is off. Excuse all this... have a seat! - Some tea? - No, thank you. The two of them are with Julia's parents. For the moment. Is everything alright? Honestly? Could be better... But it'll be fine. What are your plans? Not to give up, for sure. We'll win the appeal against the eviction, no doubt about it. You think I'm crazy, too? No. But... Is it worth it? Maybe you don't understand but this is about my family. Karl is just a kid but, still, he's aware of it all and... You don't forget something like that. You, in my shoes, wouldn't just get up and leave either. I'm not who you think I am. I work for Grone. You work for Roland Grone? I'm just one of his movers. But I also know about his other business. I know his methods, his business partners... These are dangerous people, Jan. You need to move out. Did he send you? Nobody knows I'm here. They're dangerous, Jan. They really are. You invade my life. You make presents, act like you're a friend, and now you dare to come here and threaten me and my family? - I only wanted to help. - Yeah? Why? Why help me? I... Something to drink? OK, from the top... Roland Grone... - Since when do you work for him? - I'd better go now. I thought you wanted to help. - You stay until the police is here. - Open the door. You're going nowhere. Hey, what the... If you ever come near my family again, I'll destroy you. What are you having? One beer. - What's your name again? - Walter. You gamble? Good for you. Drink, Walter. Are you my nanny now? - No. - So why are you here? I saw you. - In front of Jan Haller's building. - What's it to you? I testified in your favor today. So did the others. So? Think I owe you now? The tenant's charge is worthless now. He'll move out soon, Roland is on it. I mean... No need for you to risk probation. So you are my nanny after all. Don't worry about me. I've been nice to you out of respect for the elderly. Take your time, finish your beer, and all's fine. It's better if you leave Jan Haller alone. - What was that? - For you to leave him alone. What's the matter with you, old man? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? What? - Good evening. - Evening. Back there in the gambling hall there's a man carrying a gun. He's on probation. Can I come in? What do you bench? Those days are over. So it's all just for show? Want to hear something funny? Just after you left, the cops come into the place. Took me inside their little bus. Almost had to strip naked for those bastards. Know what they were looking for? But I'm asking myself... How'd they know where I was? Can you explain that to me? You don't talk much, do you? This time we clink, my friend. Who do you think you are? Think you're better than me? Are you out of your mind? Did you call the cops? Go get another glass. Roland doesn't need to know about any of this. It's our little secret. But you've got to leave the kid alone. Stupid asshole! Why do you make it so hard for me? He's my son. Jan Haller. The tenant. He's my son. Don't harm him. I know he's got to go. - I'm on it, I'll talk to him. - Why didn't you say so before? He doesn't know I'm his father. I didn't see him grow up. His mother didn't want me in her life. Why didn't you take care of your son? I picked him up from kindergarten. All I wanted was a day with my son. With my child. And when I took him home that night, the police was already there. They grabbed me, and forced me onto the floor, in front of him. He cried. He wasn't supposed to see me like that. So I lost it. I couldn't stand it. I beat the living daylight out of those cops. So bad I knew I couldn't turn back. So I ran for it. A guy like me is no good for a kid. You didn't raise the kid. It's not your fault he's a fuck up. He doesn't even know you. Basically, you have nothing to do with him. What do you want from the guy? He won't listen to you. Why should he listen to a stranger? - He'll listen to me. - Bullshit. Sons never listen to their fathers. I'll bring him to his senses. For you. You don't have to do a thing. I'll take care of it. This stays between us. Agreed? No work today. Alfred's in the hospital. Crashed into a tree, drunk. Walter? Boy, I... Is everything OK? A guy I know is in intensive care. Not allowed to see him yet. Have you been waiting long? Do you know him well? A colleague. I'm sorry. How about going home and coming back later? I'll stay a while longer. You're a good guy, Walter. No I'm not. Yes... You are. Gotta go. He's lucky to have you. Get in. - Where are we going? - Paying Moussa's family a visit. Moussa's been missing for a few days now. First his probation officer calls me, then his uncle. No one knows where he is. He asked me to drop by. He asked about you. Said Afsari, Moussa's uncle. He wants to talk to you. Why? No idea. Hello. - Shoes, please. - Yes. Hello. Roland, my friend... Thank you for coming. This is Moussa's father, Hadi. This is Walter, he works for me. My son... Baran. My brother Hadi arrived this morning with his family. We're all very concerned. Roland is a friend of the family, he'll help us find Moussa. I'll do what I can. The police found Moussa's car in a parking lot in Raunheim. No trace of him. Moussa is no easy kid, he doesn't tell us much. He's got a mind of his own. Where is my son? Please, where is my son? I've asked all around town but no one knows anything. He didn't even tell Baran anything. The two are like brothers. We'll find our son. What got Moussa so angry when you talked to him at the gambling hall? I only told him to follow the rules. If only because of his probation. I think it made him angry. Did you speak to Moussa again afterwards? No. The 'Hattrick' gambling hall in Nidda Street? Yes. And the encounter was pure chance? Nidda Street... Is that on your way home? Are you OK, Mr. Scholl? It's been a long day. But he never came to see you here, did he? No. We hardly knew each other. And after the gambling hall? He wasn't here that night? - No. - We found Mr. Afsari's car. Your address was on his GPS. His last destination, so to speak. He wasn't here. To put it differently: Any idea why he was headed your way? No idea. - Hello. - Hello. Can I help you? I'm supposed to pick up Karl. Wait here for a second and I'll go for his teacher. Where are we going? - Do you like boat trips? - Yeah. Good. I'm going inside for a minute. You stay put and keep holding tight. Hello? Hello? If the apartment isn't cleared by tomorrow you won't see the boy again. Listen, we'll do whatever you want! Had enough? When are we going home? Whenever you want. I was on a ferry like this once with my son. Now he's grown up. But back then, he was little boy. He was four. I'm four, too. That's right. Karl? We're there. I can't take you upstairs. You'll find your way, right? Fine. I had fun today. Karl! Julia! Are you OK? You OK? Fine, all's fine. Go inside. I've got him. I've got the kidnapper. The bus stop at Beuth Street. Beuth Street. Now you're in for it. Can you hold this? Listen, I need your help! I'm calling an ambulance. Yes, hello! We need an ambulance. We need some space. HEBERAU PENITENTIARY - Hello. - Hello. - Do you have an appointment? - Yes, we do. - Your first visit? - Yes. Are you family? Family, yes. Revised and Synchronized by FAST TITLES MEDIA
