Bring Anthony. He's staying with my sister for a little while. Yeah? Well, when he gets back we gotta get on the boat, do some fishing. Yeah. Yeah... Charlene's a little worried about you. Tell her I'm fine. Really? - Yeah. - Your partner was just killed. You're not fine. I wanna put you with Ramirez. I don't want you working on this case alone. And frankly, I don't want you working on this case at all, but... It's fine. So, what do we know? Not fucking much. What, didn't you talk to someone? Yeah, Joey's informant, Kendu Wallace. I don't know shit! I don't know shit! I'm telling you the truth! Shh... Don't scream, OK? Just be honest. You were Joey's snitch. Who killed Joey? Tell me the truth. I don't know shit, man! I'm telling you the truth! I'm not fucking lyin' to you! I... I don't know nothing. I don't know who killed Cullen. You could say we had a conversation. He knew squat. Well... why the hell you talking to him then? There was a crew over in Harlem that Joey had his eyes on. In Harlem? What the fuck is Joey doing in Harlem? He was suspended. I don't know. When we, uh... We found his camera near his body. How's his wife? She's... not too good. I'm taking her to the coroner's office to ID the body. That poor bastard! What eIse could I ask for? Got my four favorite Iadies. You won't believe what happened Iast night. The most amazing thing. No, me first. l've been waiting to telI you. -No, you go first. -No, you first. Look at you. Where's your ring? It keeps falIing off. lt's probabIy in my bag. -José shouId fix that aIready. -Yeah, right. TelI me. l think Hector's gonna propose. -No. -Yes! -You're my maid of honor? -Yes! Yes? Hey, I want to scream, too! - No. - What's up? -No, don't telI him. -Can't teIl you. -You're not telIing me? She's the boss. FinalIy! They killed him, Scotty! They fucking killed him! I mean, who would do that? They said that when they found him, he still had the knife in his back! Who would do such a thing to him? They stabbed him in the back and then they... ...they threw him away like he was a piece of trash. They butchered him. Oh, come on, are you serious? Yo, don't say that! Stuff like that really be happening. I'm serious! l'm not taIking about zombies, but... ...Don't Iaugh at Isabel! Respect! Ma, l'm not laughing at her. I'm laughing at y'all. Look at your faces for believing this shit. Shut up! Here you go. What did he say to you? He didn't say anything. He stood there, motionIess. In the air? He shouldn't work with the devil. Why not? Why shouldn't he do that? The deviI is very, very bad and could kilI him. That's right. Elisa, are you okay? Elisa? Elisa? Are you okay? I'm looking for something, but can't find it. What are you Iooking for? TeIl me, what are you Iooking for? TeIl me, what are you Iooking for? -TeIl me. -My little horse. But l can't find it. Sir... Do you know where I can find one of these? Do you know where l can find one of these? There's a IittIe store down the bIock. Your granddaughter? That's a very beautiful horse. Does she have a name? Right down the bIock, you wilI find the horse. - Hey. - Hey, sweetie. Listen, you're one of us. - We're all here for you, OK? - OK. Anything you need, just tell us, OK? - OK. - All right. We're gonna find the cocksuckers that did this, mark my words. - OK. - OK. - Joey loved you. - He loved you, too. Hey, pal. Hey. How you doing? First you lose your wife, now your partner. Hey, I'm gonna have a little birthday party for the twins in two weeks. Bring your son. He's in Florida. Florida? Why are you torturing the poor kid? See you tomorrow. You know what? -I have a surprise for you. -A surprise? Mm-hmm. You want to see it? CIose your eyes. Open them now. What? You don't like it? It's not my birthday. I know it's not your birthday. This is for being such a good girI. Hmm? -What? -l've been a good girl? You're a very good girI. Take it. Do you think EIisa's okay? I don't know... I wonder if she's okay at home. -Who? -Elisa. -Who? -Elisa. I suspect something is not okay. I don't know... What's the charge? Shut up. Do you think he knows why he's here? I think he knows it's for murder. I think he knows that much. Why do you think they call him Black? I asked his pal, Kendu Wallace, why they called him Black but he didn't know. Did he know anything else? Well he knew Black didn't like Joey. He knew that. Hmm... He said Black hated him. Can I ask y'all something? Please do. What did Kendu Wallace ever do to you? I don't care about Kendu Wallace. He means nothing to me. Yeah? Obviously. Say "good doggy." Say it in Spanish. Oh, how cute! Tell him again. Aww... Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? You're a good boy! Yeah, you're a good boy. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, don't fight it. Don't fight me... Hey, look at me, don't fight it. Come on, I'm almost done. I'm almost done. Victims ID'd as Kendu Wallace and Jennifer Richards. Where's my bro, Rocky? Washing your dirty dog. Hey, careful, that's my baby. I love you and I miss you. I love you and miss you so much. Me too, my Iove. I want a kiss. l toId you her ring was too big, that it kept falIing off. WelI, it feIl off. None of that same stuff again, Eva. I'm calling from Iraq and you're still talking about... Yo, yo, yo, yo! Who's that causing ruckus in my house, man? What?! What?! Who's calling from the Middle East? My brother! So you're a free man now, my nigga. Yeah. Wow. How it feel? I ain't trying to go back in. Know that. Hey, but listen to me, you feel me? You have to stand up straight, you know? You don't have the same opportunities like you used to have. Do you hear me, Rocky? Look at me, look at me in the camera, over there. No, your boy is done. None of that bullshit. Isabel hooked me up at this butcher shop. I'm cutting meat! Meat! You like that meat, boy? So everything OK? You need me or why you call me here? How's things with you? Business is good, you know? How you? Well, they had me down at the police station the other day. Oh, yeah? Why? Something about some cop that got murdered. Um... a DT named Cullen. Oh, yeah... yeah, I heard that there was a cop that got killed over there in the subway at 191st. You know, they had some snitch pictures, man, of you and some other cat. Me? No, no, no. Why? I don't know what you're talking about. I couldn't figure it out either, I'm like, you know... You know, what type of connection could you have to this, you know? Connection? Black, I have no connection with no cops, man. You know, I'm just... I'm just out here, you know, I'm always hustling... - Well... - I don't... It was pictures of you and some Dominican nigga in front of, um... ...Club Miami. Oh, OK, OK. That's my friend, Rocky. Yo, Rock, you should let that nigga go, man! I'm serious, man! Look, my brother, this is my bro's dog. How am I gonna put the dog in harm's way? Explain it to me. Good boy! His brother was a tough ass dude, that's why he got a tough ass dog. Munch, the nigga is a dog, B! Shit, you don't understand! Cut some of that fur off and you'll get it! So you're talking about Cullen. Cullen, Cullen, the Detective Cullen? Oh, man, he's the devil. He is dirty, man, he's dirty. Do you know what he did? He violated my nigga with a stick, man. He... I don't even want to talk about that because it's just... It's just crazy that he did that to Rocky, who just got out. He did three years, he never snitched on me before, so I don't know what he was doing, maybe he was scouting him or something because... I don't know, but I have nothing to do with that. I don't know... I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. Pay that man. Come on. -José, l can't! -Just one more time. A little peek. Oh, my God. l can't believe l'm not there with you, my Iove. You're gonna kiIl me! Shh... You arejust perfect. l know you'lI be home soon. Let's just hope so. Let's see if they don't screw me over again. The other day I saw something beautiful. What did you see? lt's hard to expIain, or to understand... ...but... ...it showed me that you were coming back soon. You ever seen one of those ant farms? I got one for Chrissy for his birthday last year. He never looks at it, but I find it fascinating. It's amazing... Leslie... Anyway this Joey thing... could get pretty ugly if it's not handled properly. He had a lot of enemies and... I'm not just talking about the drug dealers he robbed. I know he was your partner but Scotty, he was a fucking idiot. You know, he was very dirty. And, unfortunately, his dirt caught up with him. But at least his wife will get his full pension. Now, the more you dig the more you risk screwing up that pension for his wife and kids. And I don't think you want that on your conscience. Like Chrissy's ant farm, sometimes the ants die. The other day I'm looking at a dead one, and he's all the way down at the bottom, and all the other ants are... ...crawling all over him like it's nothing, you know? No big deal. And Black, Mr. Jonathan Jones? There's nothing there. He has motive. What's his motive? It seems like Joey was maybe blackmailing him. Extorting him. I don't know. But he definitely has motive. Mr. Jones. The Feds have been all over him for a while now. Years. He knew that. He's not killing a cop. OK. Who else you got? Well, I'm waiting on MTA. forensics... There's this girl. I don't know. I think she might know something. This nigga's buggin'. I'm lying? Yeah, nigga on some other shit! Hating is a weak emotion. Y'all niggas gotta be better than that, B. How's it going, man? All good? Just out here. What about you? Just chillin', my nigga, just got off of work. My mom said she saw you at the butcher shop cutting meat. ...cutting meat. I got a switch my whole style up, you feel me? Yeah, man. I know, I know how it is. I don't know if you heard, but that detective you had beef with, somebody caught that nigga in the subway. He's dead. So what? I don't care nothing about that faggot ass cop. Whether he's dead or alive, B. I hear you, but the cops got some snitch pics of you and me. I'm just giving you the heads up in case they come calIing. l'm telIing you this, just in case. Maybe you should lay low. Yo, my nigga. I already told you, that shit ain't up for discussion. HaiI Mary, fulI of grace, the Lord is with you... ...blessed art thou among women... ...and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Now, and at the hour of our death. Amen. -My love. -See you next week. Good-bye. Olga. Olga. Yes, dear. Do you believe... ...that God wouId alIow us... ...to see angeIs? Yes, if He chooses so. He can close our eyes, or open them. Certainly... ...he must have... ...a very special plan for you. For your Iife. Thank you. Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Isa? Isa, you in there? lsa? -Yes, I'lI be right out. -Open, open! Open, open, open! Open! I'm getting married! He finaIly proposed! - OK, you ready partner? - Yeah, OK. Let's get this over with. Well, our main concern is for you. So what are you saying exactly? If things came out and an investigation were opened on Joey, you know. We wouldn't want that to jeopardize, you know, Joey's pension. Really? So you come into my house, my and my dead husband's house, and you're telling me what? That you're not going to go after his killer? I want you out of my house. Scotty, make her get out of my house! I don't want her in here! OK, partner, I'll meet you outside. You know what you are, Scotty? Well, I'll tell you. You're pathetic. Look at me. Nobody likes you. Janine... Don't Janine me. You had one friend! You had one fucking person in this world who gave a flying fuck about you! Who took you kid every weekend because you couldn't handle it! Who watched your son! You couldn't even take care of your own fucking son! And this is how you treat him? l feeI Iike I'm dreaming. -l can't believe I'lI be home soon. -l know, my love. Me too... I don't know. lt's Iike a dream. What about her? What's up with this cop? l don't know her. I'm sorry, officer, my English no good. You have a card? If I see him, I call you. Lemme see, lemme see. You see this guy? He don't look Dominican, he look Puerto Rican. OK. I'm gonna ask you again. His name is ManueI de Ia Cruz. l don't know these peopIe. l don't know him. You don't know this guy either? Arnaldo Ruiz? -Because he says he knows you. -l don't know anything. We don't know those peopIe. And I guess you don't know that he was kilIed a few days ago. WeIl... What a shame. He's so young, too. Too much violence with these kids. Hey, he punches hard as heIl though. What, you're bigger than me now? You're bigger than me now? Lucky! We regret to inform you that your son, José Alvarez de la Cruz, was killed in action. My nephew is no slouch either. Let me tell you how good a cop he is. He is, in my opinion, the best doughnut guy we ever had! And he was nice enough to give a ticket to an old girlfriend of mine. A chick who, sad to say, broke the D-man's heart. How much was that ticket? Oh, that's right, $250 for blocking the bus! I call him the brains of the outfit. Hey, Rocky, I'm sorry to hear about your brother, José, man. Just waiting until I clear my head some more, you feel me? I feel you, but look, the police came looking for you the other day. - For real? - Seriously. Yo, that must be what that nigga Naldo was talking about, remember? Come on, bra, pay attention. That nigga Naldo is dead. - That nigga's dead, B? - Yeah, my dude, nigga's dead. You just watch your back, man. Word is Black is the one that killed Naldo. That's crazy, man. Maybe you should just lay low for a minute. What is it? Come on, what do you got, partner? I don't know, probably nothing. Isn't that the girl from the photo? - What? - Tell me about your kids. My kids? What do you wanna know? What are they like? They're loud. They're wild. They're annoying. They're loud. Yeah. What about you, huh? What about your kid? - He's quiet. - Yeah. - And sloppy. - Yeah. He's a good kid. Anthony. How are you doing, dear? Marisol, how's she doing? -It's hard for everybody. -Yes, of course. lf you need anything, please let me know. Thanks so much. Hey, let me ask you a question. What'd you really think about Joey? He was there for me when my wife died. Yeah. OK. Elisa... -Elisa, are you okay? -Yes. What's her name? Isabel. Isabel. ReaIly? You named her lsabeI? Yes. lsa. Isa... You okay, mami? You OK, Mami? You gonna be okay? Go. l'Il cIose. OK... Go, go. It seems your mom is running late. Don't worry. She'lI be home soon. Come here. -l'Il take you home. -No, I don't wanna go home. No. But you have to go home. Your mom is running Iate. Can I come to your home? No. You have to go to your home. No. Let's go. Let's go. HeIlo. HelIo, my Iove. l'm Elisa's teacher. What's your name? Isabel. Thank you very much for bringing her home. You're pregnant. That's not possibIe. Janine. Keep your eyes closed! OK. Are they closed? Yeah. OK. Happy Birthday. You remembered. Of course I remembered. Now you gotta make a wish. Come on. It's good. - Janine... - You gotta relax. The kids won't be back till tomorrow. You swore at me 'cause I was mean to you. - But I lied. - Yeah. When I said that you didn't have no fucking friends. I'm your friend. And I care about you. Hmm? - We can't. - We can't what? I can't. What? Janine... Janine... Janine, what? Shh... It's OK. It's OK, it's OK, it's OK. Janine... If you want to leave, you can leave. But it ain't no good being alone. Hey... l have something to telI you alI. We need some good news. Something... reaIly marvelous. IncredibIe. Something very unexpected has happened. It's a miracIe. Say it already! l'm pregnant. lt's a miracle. It's crazy. l don't know how it happened. But how can you be pregnant? José stayed in lraq for a year. l know, l know. It's a miracIe! Remember what I told you I saw that night in the subway? It was so incredibIe words can't describe it. I beIieve that night, God... ...and the blessed mother did something special for me. For alI of us. He already knew José wasn't coming home. So he gave us this gift. GIoria, l'm pregnant. Gloria... Gloria. Gloria... You wouId do this to us? You would do this to José? She needs to leave this house right now. Let her parents take care of her. - I don't want her here! - I'll tell her to leave. Manuel... Manuel... You do beIieve me, right? You think I don't feel guilty? I don't know. Of course I do. But you should feel way worse! Come on. Don't be a little pussy. We didn't do nothing wrong. Your wife is dead, my husband's dead. We're just human. I know. Besides, Joey wasn't no choir boy. Yeah, I know. I know he took money from dealers. Everybody knew that. Yeah. He did more than that. Remember that... A few years ago, that Dominican kid? Yeah, of course. What about it? He did do it, Scotty. One day he just broke down, and he told me everything. But the kid was a real troublemaker, you know? He was dealing drugs and shit. Joey said he was just trying to mess with him, you know? But I don't want my Joey's name tarnished with this shit, OK? I mean, we got kids! I mean, you owe him that much. Hello? Hey, buddy, it's me. How's it going? Hi, Dad, I'm sleeping. I know. I know, OK. Go back to sleep. Dad, did you get my card? I did. It's the best card ever. You really liked it? I loved it. Uh... I'm coming down to visit soon. When? Soon. I just gotta finish a case here, and then I'm coming down. Anthony? Anthony, OK, go back to sleep. - Oh, Dad... - Yeah. Did you have a nice birthday? Yeah, it was good. The, uh... The guys, um... they had a little cake, you know, and a little something for me down at the station. It was... It was real nice. OK, um... go back to sleep, huh. - I love you. - Good night, Dad. - I love you, too. - OK, good night. Good night, pal. Olga. Olga, Olga... Olga. It's so good to see you. How have you been? Everything is fine. l came by your house a few times, but you were aIways out. I wanted to show you the miracIe. Yes, l heard you were pregnant. Mm-hmm. l know this miracle is hard for peopIe to understand... ...but if anyone would understand, l knew it would be you. Look, Isabel... l have more shopping to do. OIga... Olga... ...l would love for you to pray for me and the baby. lsabeI... What you need is to taIk to the priest. Just a simpIe blessing, Olga. I feel peace when I hear you pray. Father... ...AImighty Lord... ... I bless you for alIowing... ...a baby to form in the womb of your daughter. HeIp lsabeI... ...to guard this new Iife... ...so no one can hurt it in any way. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Good-bye, lsabeI. Thank you. Playboy, how much they pay you up in here? Why, you need a job? Nah, man, I'm just curious, man. Ah, let me see. How about some... pig butt? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Pork butt. Yeah. Let me get the biggest piece you got, man. Yeah. And trim all that fat off, homie. Yeah. Yeah. You know I like my butt to be firm, feel me? You know, for some reason I just feel like you one of them brothers that's been violated before, you know? Like I don't know what it is, but I just get that vibe, you know. That type of energy from you, man. Have you ever been sodomized or anything like that before? Now I'm just saying, no, no, no, hear me out, hear me out, because if you have... ...it wasn't your fault. Because you see, if you decided to kill the nigga that did it to you. I don't think anybody would hold that against you, homie. So you obviously know more about me than I know about you. - I tell you what. - What's up? - This is what I need you to do. - What you need me to do? I need you to go to the police and tell them what happened between you and that little faggot cop, Cullen. Because you see right now they thinking that I'm the one that killed him. And you and me both know that that ain't what happened. If you came here to kill me, right? You better make sure you do a good job, homie. And that's the only thing I'ma tell you. You know, under different circumstances you could've been one of my top employees. Thank you, come again. We're so happy that you're back home. I'lI pray the rosary tomorrow. Mm... Do you want to come with me? l can't. I have to work. How is your work going? Bring on the next one. Enjoy. Isabel, I need to talk to Manuel De La Cruz. Do you know where I can find him? Half-a-pound of that now? She's crazy out here. Nah, we got to get at her. Hi. Isabella Rossellini. Where's Manuel? He Ieft town for a while. Where did he go? Hejust needed to go away for a whiIe. A little vacation, you know, to clear his head. When wiIl he be back? Only God knows that. Boys, our shift is over. Time to re-up. - Dibronski. - He's downtown. Oh, perfect. Hey, talk to me. Well, let's see... He's dead. He's dead. She's dead. Mr. De La Cruz is nowhere to be found. And she saw something. She was there. But what am I gonna do? Bring her in? She'll be dead in a week. No one's saying a thing. And suddenly nobody speaks English either. Well, your Spanish is half-way decent, isn't it? My Spanish fucking sucks, but that's not the problem. It's just nobody's talking. Nobody's saying a fucking thing. And I don't fucking blame them. But somebody knows something. She knows what happened. But what am I gonna do? Haul her in? Get her killed? Shit! Are you a known felon? Because Mr. Jonathan Jones here cannot associate with any known felons. So this is their new plan? To just sit there and harass me to death? What can you do? They think you killed a cop. OK. Oh... I know you. I remember you! I remember you! Elisa, don't move! Elisa! What are you doing? You can't do that. You can't do that. Look at me. You couId have kiIled yourseIf. Don't ever do that. Where are your parents? Huh? Where are your parents? l don't know. Who did this to you? Huh? Who did this to you? You Iike it? Come here. lt's getting late. You know what? Since l was IittIe, I aIways Ioved the name Elisa. And l toId alI my friends to caIl me that. You have a very, very beautiful name. -Let's go. Let's go. -Yes, Isabel. My baby. I'm so tired, Mama. My back hurts. Baby, you need to take care of yourseIf. You need to rest more. Do you want me to prepare you a hot, nice bath? -Yes? Okay, I'lI be back. -Thank you, Mama. A nice, hot bath wilI do you good. Tomorrow l have to take you home. l Iove you, Isabel. lsabeI, my Iove. Your bath is ready. -It's ready, my Iove. -I'm so tired. l'm going to sIeep. Okay, my love. That's fine. My love. You know, l'm so happy that you are home now. We both missed you so much. Yes, Mama. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. We're going to show Uncle Scotty how pretty your hair can be. Her. Who is this? A girl. I can see that. Joey had some photos of her on his camera. She's related to the Dominican kid that he had that... Shh. Hey, sweetheart, you want to go upstairs? You can go watch some cartoons, OK? They love TV. Was Joey messing round with this bitch? I don't know. Yeah, so what's your point? I mean, what's this got to do with anything? I don't know, I just wanted to know if he mentioned anything, or if you ever saw her or or anything. No, I never saw her before. So are you gonna stay a little while? I can't. I gotta get to the city. Whatever. Can we go to the park? Not this time, precious. I need to take you home. Elisa, come on. WaIk faster. -I don't want to go home! -We have to get you home. -l don't want to! -Please, pIease. -I don't want to go home! -Elisa, please. -l don't want to! -Okay, caIm down. Okay. It's aIright. lt's alright. Come on. Come on. Come with me. - So that's it? - That's it. And what about Jonathan Jones? We're just gonna let him off? Is your gut telling you he's our guy? Cause what about the kid that Joey allegedly sodomized? Any word on him? It's either him or Jonathan Jones, OK? I know that much. Scotty you're not gonna drop this, are you? What is this? Who is she? Well, your buddy raped her. At least that's what she said, and will say under oath. We're dropping the investigation, let it go. Your buddy was a rapist. You understand me? He was not a good guy. The department's not gonna take a fall for that prick. So the case is dropped for good. It's dead. That's it. They're not gonna be bothering you anymore. I got the inside line, the cops are dropping the investigation into Joey Cullen's murder. And I am 100 percent certain about that. That's what I want to hear. You did good, Mr. Himmel.
