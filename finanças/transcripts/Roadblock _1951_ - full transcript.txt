Head for the street. - Listen mister, I'm... - Keep walking. Get in. Behind the wheel. Start moving. - I didn't see a thing back there. - No? - I wouldn't be no witness to anything. - Turn right. Pull over. Give me the keys. - I know what you're thinking. - Do you? You shot a man, only one guy in the world who saw you. That would be you. - I'm a stranger, I don't even know you. - It's too bad we had to get acquainted. Listen mister, I know how you feel. I'm not kind of a guy to go running to the cops, I'm on the I am myself. - I swear it, I can prove it. - There isn't time. - A bank heist, I got the dough. - Hot money? Sure it's hot, that would prove I wouldn't go to the cops, would it? A hundred Gs, that's what I got, very good. - Give you a big fat hunk of it. - Where is it? - Not far from here, about ten minutes. - You're lying. - I ain't lying. - You get a bullet right between your eyes. My uncle's grave. He was always good at keeping money, so I thought I'd let him keep mine safe. Like I said, I buried it good. No ghost. Meet Harry Miller, the guy I shot for your benefit. He's my partner. Our insurance company covers the bank you stuck up in LA. We didn't want you particularly, we wanted the money. That's nice to know. You ever need any insurance, look us up. - A hundred Gs, I guess that's it. - Nice, nice night's work Harry. What's next? You grab the first plane to the coast with the dough. I'll book this guy and clear up the other details. I'll see you in a few days. There you are Mrs Johnson, thank you. I've a reservation for Los Angeles. - Ah, what's the name please? - Joseph Peters. Oh yes Mr. Peters, that's a reservation for one. - There you are Mr. Peters, pleasant flight. - Thanks. Announcing the arrival of United Airlines flight number 22 from Denver at Gate 7.

TWA flight 3 from New York now arriving at Gate 2. Yes ma'am? I'm Mrs Joseph Peters, my husband is flying to Los Angeles. Well, that's right, on flight 21. I wasn't going with him but we changed our plans. He's sitting right over there. Don't tell me you haven't any space left? - Yes, we have a seat for you Mrs Peters. - Thanks. And, can we take advantage of the first week reduced fares for husbands and wives? Certainly can. That will be 70.64. Alright. Your attention please. TWA flight 21 for Kansas City and Los Angeles.

Tell me, what was with that Double O... treatment you were giving me back in the waiting room? - What treatment? - A big smile, then the ice. - Your name please? - Joseph Peters. Mrs Joseph Peters. Hey, what's with this Mrs Peters? You know you can't get away with it. - What's your name? - Diane Morley. - Real or phony? - What are you? A Cop? - Yes, sort of, I'm an insurance detective. - Maybe I picked on the wrong guy. - Yeah, maybe you did. - Fasten your seat-belts please. - Now look Sister. - I'm not your sister. I'm your wife, till we get to Los Angeles, fasten your seat-belt. You played me for a soft touch, why? What nonsense, this isn't costing you a dime. Keep talking. - Certainly ask a lot of questions. - Part of my job. You must've an angle, what is it? I simply wanted to get to the coast and didn't have enough money to get there. Except by bus. I happen to be a girl who likes to travel first cabin so I. So you moved in on me. - Is that make me poison? - I don't like chiselers. Look mister... Just because I was smart enough to bought a plane ticket half fare I'm a chiseller? In my league, you are. Your attention please. In the interests of safety... we are making an unscheduled landing at Cassville Missouri. There is no cause for alarm, the field is clear. But there will be a delay in the flight until the storm is passed. Accommodations have been arranged for you in a local hotel. You will find your baggage there waiting for you, thank you. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Peters, room 6. There's your key. I definitely said we wanted two bedrooms. Pal, with the place crowded with plane passengers, you're lucky to get one. This is a suite. What's the matter? You and the missus fighting? Not yet. - Can I open a window or something? - No. No thanks. This archway could use a door. Look, don't complain, it's your idea about being my wife. I'll match you for the bed. - Maybe we can use it in shifts. - Don't be funny. Alright. I'll match you. My bed. - There's only one blanket. - Phone and get another one. But there isn't any phone. It's a flight of stairs. There isn't another blanket in the house. For the blanket. Alright, you match me. Would you mind, turning your back? - Don't you trust me? - Should I? - Think it will be safe there? - Positive. Honest Joe Peters. - What's wrong with being honest? - Not a thing. I bet all the finance companies have two gold stars after your name. I pay as I go for everything. Someday you're going to want something nice and expensive. Which you can't afford on a detective's salary. Like what? Like me. Good night. Good night. They tell me downstairs we'll be able to take off by noon. I bet that makes you happy. Could be. Want some more coffee? And a cigarette. What makes you the way you are? What makes anybody the way they are? You tell me. The way they got started maybe. I'd a lot of jobs. Modeling, clerking, secretarial work. I've tried hard but it is no go. That make a chiseller out of you? Must've been something else. Whenever I got a job there was always a man who... wasn't interested in my working ability. - I can understand that. - Really? Really? Coming from you that's a compliment. Might be, then what? - Then I met a fella. - Another one? Yes, from Texas. I fell in love with him, but he couldn't marry me. Wife object? - He wasn't married except to his family. - Where is he now? Went back to Texas. I hear from him once in a while, he's still single. He claims he never got me out of his system. - Bitter about it, eh? - Not anymore. What you going to do out on the coast? I'll take my chances. I'm in fear of being kicked around Honest Joe. I'm going to start out with silver fox and go on from there. - Then ermine, sable? - Everything. You know what everything is? - What? - Money. - Happiness doesn't count, eh? - Can happiness buy money? Oh, you're all wrong babe. Doesn't a guy like you ever dream and want fine things? - Sure, everybody does. - And what happens? - I wake up, the feeling passes. - Then you're stupid. What are you dreaming about now? It takes two. Yeah. I just found out. You're a nice guy Honest Joe, but you're not in the right league. I'm aiming to the World Series. To the World Series. When do I see you again? - You don't. - Why? I told you. - Oh, I don't believe you. - You got to. I'm on a rocket to the moon, I don't want anything holding me back. You still haven't told me what you going to do out here. Don't worry about me Honest Joe. I got connections in this town, good ones. Very touching, who's the babe? - Oh Harry, how's everything? - Don't change the subject, who is she? Oh, she's a little girl I was marooned with on the way back. - Nice marooning. - Yeah. Hi you Mary. - Let me do the talking. - Ok. Good morning boss. Good morning Joe, glad to see you back. I told Harry but I guess I'd better tell you. Swell job you did with that bank robber. Yes, I was rather brilliant myself. Yes sir, one hundred percent recovery, is worth a pat on the back. Tell me, is it worth a week off? To go up to our cabin to do a little hunting. - I might've known. - We need a little fresh air and exercise. We lived in some awful dives chasing that guy from California to Ohio. Cabin would be nice. Ok, take a week off, beginning Monday. Yes? We just got a flash from Police Headquarters Mr. Thompson. There's been a robbery at Brissard Furs. - Another one? - Yeah, last night. Ok, we'll get right on it. Sorry boys. - It was a quick hunting trip. - Yeah, we now trap furs. I'll go over to the Brissards with you myself. That place is been robbed three times in a year. Three times in one year, three times. I unlocked the door this morning and this is what I find. - Three times in one year, I get robbed. - We know all that Mr. Brissard. What are these? Oh, a couple of cheap skins they dropped in their rush. What gets me though is how they got in here and blew that safe. This place is burglar-alarmed from top to bottom. Any idea what the loss is? Fifty to 75 thousand, I don't know yet. You better have a look at your inventory. I've been listening to excuses for a month now. In another 30 days we pay out 68,000 dollars. - Whole thing smells of Kendall Webb. - The police don't think so. They questioned Webb and a lot of his boys. Sure, but they're the original alibi kids. Kendall Webb is in this Brissard deal clear up to his ears. - Alright, let's prove it then. - Any suggestions? I'm only the General Manager here, you fellas are supposed to be detectives. But here is a tip for what it's worth. Webb spends at least three nights a week in a place called Larry's Club. That I know, but it is one catch, I can't afford to drink there on my pay check. Put it on the expense account but let me have some action. There's Mr Webb now with his new girl, quite a dish, ain't she? Yeah. ♪ So swell of you to make my dreams come true. ♪ ♪ I'd always read in tales of old... ♪ ♪ That many charms were made of gold. ♪ ♪ I never knew the charms could be... ♪ ♪ Designed of human personality. ♪ ♪ So swell of you to make my moonlit night shine brighter... ♪ ♪ And make my days of happiness carefree. ♪ ♪ We pledged our love and took a vow... ♪ ♪ And yet I'll never know just how... ♪ ♪ Somebody knew I love you too. ♪ ♪ So swell of you. ♪ - Match you to see whether you talk to me. - Who you match for the silver foxes? Believe it or not, I bought them myself, with my hard-earned money. - Hard earned? - Easy on the sarcasm Honest Joe. I have a perfectly legitimate job, modeling. - What are you doing? - I'm a fur fancier. I just wanted to make sure you bought them from a reputable firm. - Did I? - Yeap. But you're running around with a very disreputable guy. - Mister Webb? - The biggest racketeer in town. - I like his type. - What's wrong with mine? I tried to explain, it's no good with us Joe, we're not on the same team. You never make the World Series. - What you want me to do? Rob a bank? - You know how? - Run back to your playmate. - Not while you're mad. Joe... Takes two. Does alright for himself, doesn't he? Good evening Mr. Webb, I'm Joe Peters. This Terry Miller, we're from the Southwest Indemnity. - Oh, I have all the insurance I need. - It's about a fur robbery. Take it easy. Don't you know you can get in to trouble forcing your way into people's homes? - You fellas have more nerve than real cops. - Thanks. - A celebration? - Pre Christmas, for two and private. We want to talk to you about that building you own over on Wilshire. The one you rent to the Brissard Fur Company. You looking for something? Kenny darling, I wanted you to be the first to see it, how you like it? Not bad, not bad at all. You know this gentleman? - No, should I? - No. They are insurance investigators. Better show them the sales slip for your coat. - I think, they think I stole it. - Sure. It will change their minds. When people infer I'm dishonest hurts my feelings. Don't get us wrong Mr. Webb. Just because I own the building, doesn't make me liable for everything. - It's a nice coat miss. - It sure is mister. Doesn't take much to make a girl happy, does it? Not much. See you soon Mr. Webb, thank you for the cooperation. Smart cookie, he paid real dough for that coat. Imagine, he must've all that Brissard stuff stashed away on ice somewhere. - Hey, I'm talking to you. - What? Webb, remember? The fur robbery. Can't you keep your mind off that girl long enough to earn a living? I wasn't thinking about her. So you weren't. Come on, we'll talk about at the office tomorrow. How did you get in? Detectives get most anything they want, when it comes to passkeys, that is. Oh, it's only a few days to Christmas, I thought you ought to have a tree. Old American custom. Thanks. I didn't get you anything else. - You know why? - Why? Nothing would be good enough. You're wrong Joe, anything would've been good enough. Nice little place. I'm going to have a lot better. - We're not getting anywhere, are we? - We never have. What you expect me to do? I haven't any real money, I never will have. I can earn my keep. I can look at myself in the mirror. When you look in the mirror, what do you tell yourself you want? You. I want you so bad, I can't think straight. You're what I want for Christmas, day after the 4th of July. Saturday nights, all the days there are. And I want you Joe. But not as an insurance Cop making 350 a month. What do you want? - A pair of shoes. - We don't have your size. - Nine and a half. - I've said we don't have your size. Empty. What? Are they all empty? - You looking for trouble? - Look, all I want is a pair of shoes. Tell you what I'll do, I'll take a pair of shoes any size. What's the trouble? Funny man, insists on buying a pair of shoes. Hello Mr. Peters. Go on back inside. - Well, I never expected to see you here. - Why not? This where you collect for all your rackets. Smart man, trying to collect a little something for yourself? Oh, I already have. Facts on the life of Kendall Webb. How he got himself a penthouse, money to buy mink coats and everything else he wants. He's gotten away with everything from income tax evasion to murder. Then he winds up a man of distinction with a pretty wife in Las Vegas, a... dummy shoe store and property all over the place. Well? Why you wasting your time? If you really had anything you wouldn't sit there talking, you'd take me in. Let's say I don't have anything, let's just say I'm close. Close enough to offer you a trade. You fascinate me. Look, I can keep on the way I'm going and eventually have you in a lock up. You engineered the Brissard Fur robbery, but that's only part of it. Assuming you're right, where is the trade come in? You got something I want. An effective organization, men all over the country. - When you say jump, they jump. - You put it very well. Supposing you knew someone who had inside information. On the movement of money from local banks to Federal Reserve. Currency shipments. Like this million and a quarter. All old bills, hard to trace. - What you trying to sell? - Million and a quarter. Why? Because I want a hunk for myself, a big hunk, a third. - Why? - So I can give away mink coats. - What do you think it will get you? - The same as gets you. - You know, I think you're on the level. - Don't worry, I'm on the level. You know, it took a reform school and several jails to build my character. You, you've probably been square all your life. Now suddenly you decide to steal. Just goes to show you, you can't trust anybody. Webb, you want to make a speech or a deal? - What kind of a deal? - Knocking over a railway mail car. - Mail robbery is a 25 year rap, straight. - That is if you get caught. If you know how to do it, you won't. If you know every mile of the route, how many men are aboard, how to get inside. - Are you interested? - Very. We don't have your size. Where is Mr Webb tonight? Gone up to Las Vegas this afternoon to visit his family. Seems like most everybody goes home for Christmas Eve. Seems like. I've been watching the clock all evening. Can't wait to get home and decorate the tree. Now, those two kids of mine. Will they be goggle eyed when they go downstairs in the morning. I'm telling you, there's nothing like kids at Christmas time. You'll find out when you have a couple of your own. Merry Christmas. Come in. - You alone? - Yeah, just me and my bottle, come on in. - Drinking alone isn't good for you. - You just finding that out? Just. - I had to see you. - What about? About us. I just realized tonight I'm crazy about you. I'm crazy about you too. But my pay check is only 350 a month, remember? - I'm going to fix that. - Stop it Joe. Why should I? That's what you want. You wrong, I want you just as you are. What about Webb? - What about him? - He can't have us both. - Want to know something? - What? I don't need Webb's permission to marry you or anybody. - No? - No. Now, kiss me and tell me how much rent we can afford out of your 350 a month. - So you want pull out of our little deal? - That's what I said. Ok, you're out, we'll go ahead without you. Why don't you talk sense. I said the caper is off. My company insures that money. All at once, you're a company man, honest Joe. Look Webb, I said the deal is off. Oh no. Who trying to fool Joe, besides yourself? You think she's going to be happy with that bag of peanuts... you pick up for a monthly pay check? Is Diane been talking to you? You're suspicious of her even before you marry her, that's bad. Look Joe, I'll put you right. I haven't seen or talked to her. Since you took advantage of the holiday spirit while I was gone to talk to her... You making a lot of conversation, I got an appointment. Yes, I know. City Hall, in a couple of hours. - You know everything, don't you? - Well, you have a file on me. Is there any harm in my keeping track of you? Sit down, I'll tell you some more. I hate to see you make a chump of yourself Joe. You cooked up a foolproof job and came to me with it for a very good reason. You wanted Diane but you didn't have her kind of money. Now, you think you can have her without the money. It won't work Joe, you think it will. And maybe she thinks so now, but it won't. It'll last a couple of months maybe. Then she'll start thinking about the nicer things. The things she had, that you can't give her. What are you going to do then? That's my problem. There won't be any problem when you have important money. You know, once a girl gets the feel of mink around her shoulders, she doesn't forget it. Even if she's in love and tries awfully hard. Think it over. Someday you going to want something nice and expensive. You can't afford on a detective's salary. You know, once a girl gets the feel of mink around her shoulders, she doesn't forget it. Even if she's in love and tries awfully hard. How many men do you figure will take for the job? Five, you got that many you can trust? - I can find them. - How about the getaway? Let's have some secrets from each other. Such as who my men are and what happens to them. Then if anybody asks you anything, you just don't know. - I don't like secrets. - I do. - From here on, I'll take over. - Not yet. Here is a note with the serial numbers of the mailbags with the money in them. Save looking round. The train leaves Los Angeles on the 14th, 5 PM. Well, I guess that takes care of everything. All except one little detail, my share. I want you to mail it to me, Parcel post. No return address. North Creek, California, general delivery. You want me to put that kind of money in the mail? - Somebody will steal it. - Nobody ever steals from the mail. Hardly ever. - Who takes you so sure I'll send it to you? - You'll send it to me alright. I can tell that by looking at my file on you. Put the money in this portable fire pump, mail it to me in a carton. - General delivery, North Creek, California? - That will reach me. Just a minute Joe. Give my best to Diane, North Creek sounds great for a honeymoon. There you are Caleb. Well, well, well Joe Peters, married, I can't believe it. - And this is your little bride? - That's right. And you're on your honeymoon, Oh, I'm so happy. So are we. - You be staying in the cabin, won't you? - Just for tonight. Tomorrow, we're riding up into the black country, going to really rough it. Well, that's just fine. I hope you'll like it dearie. I'm sure I will. Well, take plenty of warm clothes, it's awful cold in the mountains. - Who gets cold on a honeymoon? - Oh Mr. Peters. You know what day this is? It's 13th, why? It's our anniversary, we've been married a week. Want to know something? - What? - I like it. Something wrong? No, no, I was just thinking we got to ride down to the store tomorrow for supplies. Thinking of supplies when you're kissing your bride. That mean the honeymoon is over. It will never be over for us baby. Blue jeans, four dollars. Two cartons of cigarettes, three dollars and 30 cents. - Now, that be all? - You better ask him. Anything else Mr. Peters? - Mr Peters, is there anything else? - No, I think everything is on the list. You know, when it comes to toy trains men are just like little boys. Turn the switch, make it run. Ok. We going somewhere? Not until we take off for the mountains in the morning. Why you keep looking at the clock? You're actually jumping. What is it? Ok, you might as well know. Webb and I are in on a big deal. We'll be rich for life if it comes off tonight. You and Webb? You said you wanted me and a lot of money, now you have both. I don't need both now. - Call it off Joe please. - It's too late. Except to hope that nothing goes wrong. If something does? They won't suspect me, I'm up in the mountains on my honeymoon. Honeymoon is over before it started. Oh relax baby. - In a few days we'll have so much money... - Who cares about money? We interrupt our program of recorded music now to bring you a newsflash. Bandits held up a train in the mountains near Saint Louis Obispo shortly after midnight. The heavily armed desperadoes dynamited the mail car... and escaped with three sacks of registered mail. It was the most daring train hold up in California history. Henry Star, a railway mail clerk was seriously injured. The bandits made a clean get... A million and a quarter, cold cash. A third of it's ours. You hear what I said? I heard. It's all over now, nothing to worry about. No, nothing. - Everything went fine. - Yeah. As soon as the money gets here, we'll go back to town. I'll keep my job for a while, say, six months, until the heat is off. Stash the money here. - You find anything Saunders? - Yes sir. - The explosive they used was QXG. - That could be a lead. - Check with War Surplus. - Yes sir. This outfit wasn't looking for love letters they knew just what pouches to go for. Yeah. Egan talking, I want a report on every person who knew anything at all about the routing of that money shipment. Now, that shall includes, bank clerks, postal clerks, armored-car crews and insurance people. Yes sir. Ok Harry, I'll be back as soon as I can. Yeah. There's been a hold up, a big one. A hold-up? Yes, 5 guys knocked off a train carrying a money shipment insured by our firm. - Over a million dollars. - I heard that on the radio, didn't you? We weren't packing a radio in the mountains. Honey, we've got to get back to LA right away. If any mail or packages come, would you save them for me Mrs McDonald? Oh. Something did come. I clean forgot about it. A package. Say, those truck drivers don't care what they do with the mail. Oh, don't worry, it's probably a fire extinguisher I ordered. Oh, you better open it and see if anything is broken. Not a dent, not a dent to it. - Now, if you want to leave it here. - No. We got to get back to the cabin to... pack and lock up anyway. - Put Jackson on that right away. - Right. - Hi Saunders. - Hi you, married man. - Welcome home. - Good to see you Harry. - Joe. - Hello Egan. - Well, ready to go back to work. - No, wait a minute, not so fast. You know, 28 people knew about the movement of that money. Including you. - Ok, Ok, put away the hose, I'll talk. - No, you don't have to, listen to this. You and your wife arrived at North Creek at 5 PM Saturday January the 6th. You bought food and supplies. You stayed all night in your cabin, then up the mountain first thing next morning. You came back to North Creek for supplies on the 14th. Then you went back up in the mountains... and stayed, until you got Harry's message this morning. But minutes before you left. You picked up a Parcel Post package. A fire-extinguisher mailed to you from Los Angeles. The old gal at the store didn't miss a thing, did she? You went back to the cabin, locked up and arrived here at 2 PM, which is now. Wait a minute, you left out something. We stopped at Maricopa for a sandwich. - We missed that. - Joe, this is murder. The postal clerk who was injured when the mail coach was dynamited died this morning. That's rough, I didn't know. What's broken on the case so far? Not much, a farmer heard a low flying plane about the time of the hold-up. We located the field where it took off. - They made their getaway by air, eh? - Yeap, an amphibian. The hull and the wing floats left marks on the grass. From the measurements it was a Republic Seebee, now, that's a 4-place ship. But it could carry 6 on a pinch. A pilot and the five guys that stuck up the train, that's pretty clever. That means they landed on water, we'll never get them. Not necessarily, you see? Excuse me, Egan talking. Nothing doing on that amphibian from Lake Tahoe Ray. The same goes for San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. How are you doing down south? Yeah, we drew a blank in the San Diego and Lake area, San Pedro is still wide open. It's just possible we may score there. You might just as well open up Partos. The specimens of grass recover from the undercarriage... of your plane matched the growth on that field. Now, there's no doubt that you landed there. Alright, so I put the plane down at Santa Margarita... but I don't know anything about any stick up.. Nobody said you did, we're interested in your 5 passengers. A fella comes up to me last week and wanted to charter my plane. - I got to eat so I don't ask questions. - Ever seen the man before? I don't pay too much attention to him because I'm looking at what he had in his hands. Nice new C notes. And I'm listening to what he says about how there's more where those came from. You're probably remember him if you ever you saw him again though, eh? I guess maybe I would. The other 4 characters maybe not, because I don't get a good look at them in the dark. Anyway, they pile in and I take off. Pretty soon there is a light below so I set her down in the channel, then... a fishing boat comes up alongside. Then one of the characters hands me an envelope with the rest of the money in it. They get into a row boat, I go home. - What was the name of that fishing boat? - I don't know. - What's the matter? You near-sighted? - No, was too dark. It wasn't too dark to see the face of the guy who gave you the money though, was it? Maybe it was. Maybe you can pick up his picture for us later, eh? Maybe. We're getting warm. - Hello handsome. - Hi. - What's happening? - Nothing yet. I'm not sure Webb covered his tracks well enough. You told me yourself the police have never pinned anything on him. It's always a first time. What's this? Fellow wants to marry me. - What? - The one who couldn't before, from Texas. Now he can. How do you feel about it now? When I'm with you I can't even remember what he looks like. - Hello? - Is that you Joe? Say, I've been trying to get hold of you all day. I just got in. I called you at the hotel but they said you'd check out so I called you here. - Can we talk? - Yeah, I think we'd better. My government friends just picked up your pilot, a guy by the name of Partos. Partos? He has been singing? Some, about how he was hired for the job by strangers. How much more can he tell them? Not much. - I'm pretty sure that's all he knows. - Well, I hope you're right. I'll stick by him just in case, they're showing him pictures tonight. What's going on? Too much. Look, we've been here all night, how many more of these pictures do I have to look at? Only six or eight hundred more, come on, come on. I never saw that kisser before. No. No. Hold it. Yeah. That could be the guy. Matt De Vita. Well, we're dealing with a really big time operator. Saunders, put this on the wire-photo to all Federal, State and Law Enforcement Agencies. Right. - Hello? - Webb, it's me Joe. They've picked up De Vita, things don't look too good. De Vita won't talk. They're going to be tough on him. Oh, that's fine. Ah, when people get tough with De Vita he really clams up. I hope they push him around good. Nothing closes De Vita's mouth faster than a little mauling. Ok. There is no reason for you to be so difficult Mr. De Vita. You've been identified. You took a plane ride and a boat ride. - So do lots of people, everybody travels. - Well, you're going to travel some more. - You don't say? - Let me have him for a minute. Look, De Vita. My company is on the hook for a lot of dough. You could be a big help to us. But if you think you going to make monkeys out of us... - Easy. - What do you mean take it easy? I'll make this baby sing, loud and clear. - You want more? - I'll take all you got. It's only one way to handle these babies I'm telling you. Relax. Get back to the office. Bring the boss up to date, I'll take care of this end. Alright. Go ahead, handle him with kid's gloves. I still think my way is better. I thought he was an easy going guy. He was. Until he got married. Hello darling. This isn't your darling. - Oh Mr. Miller? - Sorry I scared you. Joe ought to be here in a moment, would you like a drink? No thanks. The apartment is in a mess, we're moving. - Too expensive? - Yes. Well, it won't be, not if we nail down that mail car mob. Joe's part of the reward won't be peanuts. Go right on packing, don't mind me. Why you looking at me like that? - It bother you? - Yes, it gives me the jitters. - Why should you have the jitters? - What is this? The third degree? Oh, I'm sorry. I guess it's the business I'm in. Makes us all nervous, even Joe. Have you noticed how nervous he is lately? As nervous as you are. - The way things look to me... - How do they look to you Harry? - I said, how do they look to you? - Better. After you left, well Egan and I had kind of a wild idea. Like what? We thought maybe our friend Kendall Webb could be mixed up in this. You know, De Vita is one of his boys. - You think it's an angle? - Yeah. - Yeah, might be, I'll follow through on. - Good. I'll see you tomorrow. Why did Harry come here? It doesn't make sense. I don't know, he was needling me from the moment he came in. It's not like Harry, unless he had a reason. - Wonder how much he knows. - Are you worried? It'll be alright honey. I'll fix it so it'll be alright. Get your coat, we're going up to the mountains, for the money. - Hello? - Webb? Yes. - Got to see you right away. - What's happened? Plenty, De Vita spilled his guts. You better decide on the next move, fast. I don't know what you're doing but I'm getting out of here now. You better see me before you go. Why should I? I've got a plan will clear us both up. - How? - I can't talk now. Meet me in half an hour in Mulholland Glade, just west of Beverley Glen. I don't see how? You will when I tell you what I've got in mind. You want to stay out of jail long enough to enjoy any of that money, you better be there. - What you looking at? - Your bags, are all packed. I guess you didn't believe me when I told you I had a plan to clear us both. - I might not like the plan. - If you don't? - Being packed saves a lot of time. - You're not going anywhere, Webb. - No? - No. You make it sound like I haven't very much of a future. - Number please. - Western Union please. - I'd like to send a straight wire. - To whom is the message going? Mrs Kendall Webb. Care of Club El Chico, Las Vegas, Nevada. Sending Parcel. Put contents, in safe deposit box. Love. Sign Kenny. Z. 5. 8. 4. No, the rest are too burned. For the amount of ash in Webb's car must've been loaded with money. Z584, the first three numbers check, can you make out the series? - Series, 1935 Z. - On the nose. Tallies exactly with the currency shipment list from the bank. - Same money alright. - How much richer does that make us? How do I know? If you can add up ashes, you tell me. Then we're really stuck. So are we, for years, we tried to pin something on Kendall Webb. And when we find burned money is his car and it all ties up to a mail hold-up... and a homicide, we can't indict him for murder. - Because he's already dead. - What's next Egan? A social call to Mr Webb's widow in Las Vegas. Do you mind if we take a look too Mrs Webb? Don't tell me you're saving all of this for a rainy day. Come on. The serials matched on 400,000 dollars in Webb's safety deposit box. De Vita and his four boys got $50,000 a piece, which we got back. Then Webb mailed his wife a hundred thousand. On the burnt stuff, how much is Saunders think the government may honor? - About a hundred thousand. - Yeah? About two thirds recovered. Well, I guess I ought to be happy. - Are you? - I am not. Maybe the currency burnt in Webb's car didn't account for all the missing cash. Maybe someone got his hands on, say 400,000 of it, is holding out. How's that Harry? I said. Maybe Webb didn't have all the missing money in his car. That's what I've thought you said. Got any ideas about where the rest is? - Some. - Dig it up and I'll buy you a necktie. - Let's go have a drink. - You don't drink in the daytime. - Today is an exception, a celebration. - What are we celebrating? I'll tell you when we get there. - Hi you Mike. - Hello Harry, hello Joe. - A couple of the usual. - Very well. - How is the insurance business? - Looking up. Ok Harry, what's on your mind? - There you are. - Thanks Mike. - Well, here's to it, whatever it is. - To it. - How do you say goodbye to an old friend? - Why, you going somewhere? - No, you are. - Yeah? You want to know where you slipped? You're entitled to know. My first lead was Egan mentioning that new fire extinguisher you had mailed to you. I bought a new one for the cabin last summer. Was Ok in September when we were up there fishing. Handy thing to ship stuff in a fire-extinguisher, can hold a lot of money. Like four hundred thousand dollars. - You crazy Harry. - There are a lot pieces and they all fit. Like the day you came back in Egan's office for instance, 5 guys and a pilot, you said. You knew that Webb had assigned five guys to the job, we didn't. - I still say you crazy. - You must've killed Webb to finger him. Burned money would close out the case and leave you in the clear. I brought you here like this to say goodbye. Because, I owe you that much. You're under arrest Joe, let's keep the whole thing nice. Go to the cops, then to your new apartment for a look around. Diane isn't in this, she had nothing to do with it. I didn't say she did, won't be any charge against her. Just so we get the missing money. You ready? Hey, what goes on? - What he hit me with? - A beer bottle. - Hey, I thought you two were friends. - We were. Hello? This is Joe. Now listen and get this straight. Call a cab the minute I hang up. Don't try to pack a thing, just bring the money. Meet me at the lumber yard at the corner of 3rd and Main. - You get it? - Yes. I'll be there, are you alright Joe? Would you mind telling me where we're going? Mexico, if we have any luck. Egan talking, Western Federal Division.

Alright Joe. - I'll take the gun. - You take nothing. You haven't got a chance, you've been in this business long enough to know that. - I'm getting out of here. - Give me the gun. Hello honey. - Haven't you left for Texas yet? - I'll match you to see whether I stay.
