Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK Open up! Fast! C'mon, shit! Go, go, go! Shit! We got it! We got it! Next time I'm gonna leave you there! Why did you start shooting!? You're a fucking asshole! Asshole! Hello! Hi Mancini, this is Borgia, everything's ok? Yeah, it's ok. I've got the suitcase. The car is ready. See you tomorrow? Yeah, see you tomorrow. - Mancini? - Yeah. Aren't you scared? Why should I be scared? I've got 1 hour and a half, enough even for a hitch. Bye. THE DAY AFTER Bye Violetta, see you tomorrow. That's the place. Hey! What a fuck... Hello? Hello, can I speak to Mr. Clemente Sciacchitano? Yeah, it's me. This is the secretary office of the San Giovanni Hospital. I'll put you through Dr. Menelao, hold the line. Hello? Hello? Hello, this is Dr. Menelao, am I speaking to Mr. Sciacchitano? Yeah it's me, I told you. What's up? Well, Mr. Sciacchitano, it's about your son. Massimo?! - Yeah, he had a little accident at school. - What!? No, Mr. Sciacchitano, don't worry. Nothing serious. The only thing is... that you'd better come over here. Yeah, of course, thank you. Bye. Mancini! Be careful. Who are you? Are you new? Sciacchitano had a trouble. I'm here to replace him. Shit, so fast! Clean the toilets of the third floor, the rest is ok. Ok. Hold on! Excuse me, hold on! Hold on! Excuse me, I gotta come back upstairs, I forgot one thing. - Ok, which floor? - What? Which floor? The last one, the 17th. Get in. - Are you going downstairs? - No, upstairs! You'd better get in anyway. We go to the 17th floor, but it will go down rapidly. Otherwise, you will wait too much! Ok. What's up? There's been a power cut. Don't worry, it shouldn't be serious. Nobody can hear us! I'm afraid everyone's gone and left us alone! No! Don't worry, we're gonna get out of here soon. Is anyone there? We got stuck in the lift! And you? Do something! What should I do? Don't you work here!? Why don't you call someone? I have an important appointment, I'm late! Would you please call the technical assistance? My phone calls are not refunded. No problem, use mine! You can't read those numbers. I can't remove it. It's my phone, Borgia. Hello? I got a problem. I got stuck. I got stuck in the lift with the "cleaning bucket". See what happened and how long it will take. We gotta get out of here. Why do you say "We", aren't you alone? No, I'm not. There are other people. Please, help us. I'm gonna check and call you back. What's up? Nothing. Come on! Why do you smoke?! This car will turn to a gas chamber. Ok. Press this button to set the time. If you push these two buttons at the same time, it will start. Like that! That's how you can start the countdown. - Isn't it simple? - Yes it is. I guess it's not so easy to deactivate. I would say... Before setting it make sure that you can run away. Unbelievable, it still hurts me! Last night I had a dream, Pitta'... I was running, running and running... Suddenly... I hurt my calf! I began screaming over and over. When I woke up I noticed that I had a real cramp. Unbelievable! I dreamt I was running and when I woke up I really had a cramp! Unbelievable! - That's the semi-oniric activity. - What? - The semi-oniric activity! - What does it mean? That's a process of sleep preservation. When you have a cramp you start dreaming about running. Just like when your phone's ringing while you're sleeping and you dream about answering it. No, that's not what happened to me. I dreamt about running before I had the cramp. Borgia, we're talking about dreams. Time is not consequential in dreams. - Isn't it consequential? - No. Do you dream frequently? Yeah, why? Just like everyone else. - That's strange! - Why? Because dream activity consumes an important quantity of glucose. So you should be a little thinner. - What do you mean? That I am obese? No... I'm not always dreaming about running. Sometimes I dream about standing still. In fact I always dream about keeping still, sleeping. I dream about sleeping! Ah! Shit! Shit! It's a matter of time... They are coming. Calm down! We will get out of here. "Get in, or you will wait too much!" Fuck you! So why did you accept? Maybe it's his fault, but could this change our situation? What a philosophic bog cleaner! She's right, it's my fault if she got stuck here. I'm sorry for your appointment. Yes, I guess you really are... May I have a salad? Thank you. She's a piece of ass. Yeah, she's gorgeous. Yeah, but she's easy just with managers. You still fume with rage, isn't it? He's a motherfucker bastard! Come on! Maybe it's all in your head. Maybe you could lose him for nothing. Giada, trust me, I have already lost him. - Or rather, he has lost me. - What do you mean?! I called him and dumped him on the phone. Since he loves to get blowjobs from another girl, he'd better keep on! What a bastard! You should have calmed down and everything would have come out right. I don't wanna calm down, tonight I wouldn't be giving it to him anyway! Well, it would be the first time ever! Yeah, you know me, that's why I gotta leave him before the night. But, why do you care so much? You always said that I should be with man of the same age as I am! What's up now?! I mean, you devoted yourself to him, why should you leave him right now? Now you should get the fruits of it! I mean, you wanna be a secretary forever? For now, it's nothing but a suspicion. No, it's not just a suspicion! I know that swine, he has no secrets to me, trust me. You can't be sure. Come on, it's all in your head! Are you falling in love with him or something?! - What the hell are you saying?! - So what? Just do the best for you. Trust me. Hello? I'm so sorry... sometimes I see unreal things. But I'm sure you gotta give me some explanations anyway. Don't think you can escape me... Well, we see later so we can talk about it, ok? Why we can't see?! You're busy with your wife?! You're such a bastard! Sorry. Yeah, you're right, sorry. You know... I'm... I'm a little jealous. Yeah... Well, it depends on your persuasiveness. Yeah. Ok. See you after work at the bar. Don't worry, just ten minutes then you'll be back to her. Bye, see you later, goodbye. Hungry? - What? - I said, are you hungry? Maybe... There's a bar near here, why don't you go buying something to eat? Two coffees, also. Pittana, are you kidding me? What?! When you're hungry and and you don't wanna move... Just call the fatty! He's always hungry! Isn't it? I gotta watch the car, ok? Who entrusted this car to you? It was you, but It doesn't matter! Exactly. Just do what you want Borgia, I was thinking about you. Ok. Stop it. - Anyway, what do you want? A coffee? - Thanks! Come on, who cares! I'll take a stroll, I also gotta pee. Listen, if Mancini comes back while I'm at the bar, give me a call. If I see your feet on the dashboard I will shot you down! "the bastard" Yeah. I'm in the bar... chatting with... Sartori. No darling, just five minutes... Ok, I understand, I understand! I'm coming home. Now! I told you I'm coming! Don't start pissing off! C'mon! Ok, I'm coming... Bye. Goodbye. What a pain in the ass! Fuck you! Here you are, at last. So? I got a problem. - What's the problem? - I tried to get into the building but the door is locked. The last cleaning man must have locked it. But he knew I was here. I'm with two employees also! The only thing I know is that the door was locked. I'm not stupid. Anyway, I got an alternative solution. I've made a couple of phone calls, I guess I found who we need. They are expert technicians. They understand it's a "difficult and risky" situation. You know what I mean! Anyway, I know that lock, it's a Stigler, a model of two years ago. With the right tools it wouldn't be a problem. They will get in and you will get out of there. And the alarm? If it was on, it would have been starting with you inside. Maybe it's due to the blackout, I don't know. Some models created for important buildings don't have updated cut-out boxes... Are they coming here now? In half an hour, at most. At most? What a fuck! Can't they be more precise? What the fuck do you want? They understood, don't worry! We have all the time in the world! - Fuck! - Then? It's ok, we'll get out of here in half an hour. Half an hour?! How is it possible?! If I get into panic you'll pay my psychiatrist, and I don't think you can afford it! Do you come from Naples, isn't it? How long have you been here? More than ten years. I came here about two years ago and I'm already going crazy. How often do you go there? As little as possible, Naples sucks! Ok? - Why? - Why? You said you are from Naples, isn't it? Because, for instance, your car is always in jeopardy. You treat it as a child and they scratch it or crash it. I couldn't live there. Besides, Neapolitans never do their business. For instance, it's not your fucking business if I come from Naples or Paris. Hurry up, you're late. I'm Top Manager's secretary. Someone has to solve this or things will cock up here! And someone will give explanations! Well, not me. You can call me if you find a dirty ashtray, I'm sorry, but I do the cleaning, I'm not a lift technician. Come on, take it easy! If we quarrel it will be a bad half an hour. Well, the philosophic bog cleaner and the loser shrink! Now you're kidding me, but I attended business psychology classes actually. Such situations could be taken as an example. Congratulations! You'll have a wonderful career! At the moment, I have an agreement in the business relation office. But I hope I'll be taken indefinitely. I'll tell you what, you will be here indefinitely. So you mean I can hope it! I mean here, in the lift! In the lift! Yeah, in the lift, sure... Excuse me. Hello? Hi, Ceccarelli! How you doing?! Sure, I will. When? In half an hour? I don't know if I can make it. I'm still at the office, I gotta go home and get the bag. I got stuck in the lift. I don't know how much time it will take. But maybe I can... Hello? Ceccarelli? Ceccarelli! They always call you at the eleventh hour, isn't it? What? To play soccer. Why do you say that? They just call you if someone gave up at the eleventh hour. I've been writing four tales in two days: a sci-fi, two fantasies and a western fairy tale. I've been sending them to a contest. Hey, Luigi Cozzi might read them! - Lewis Coats, the director of "Star Crash"? - Exactly. You're crazy, you still have a nice job, what do you think Lewis Coates could for you? He can't even help himself, do you really think he could help you? How far do you think we can go, Meroni? Meroni! It was people like us who made the history of science fiction! Robert E. Howard, Emilio Salgari, H.P. Lovecraft. Tell me about one of us who has made a business carrier! Bill Gates. Bill Gates again? He's an exception to the rule! What a piece of ass! She's gorgeous. Yeah, but she's easy just with managers. I heard about an indefinitely employment. Maybe I'll get a promotion. - That's impossible. - Why? I'm the first to conclude reports. I help my colleagues with theirs. I repaired my boss's computer and I gave him advices about how to improve office management. Why shouldn't he promote me? You can't play soccer. - It's not true! - You're so weak, Meroni! They call you just in desperate situations. They don't notice me 'cause I've never played with them, while they notice you because you make them lose. Do you remember? "This company needs team players"! How would you be a team player if you can't play soccer! I repeat, forget her! Violetta Grimaldi will never be with you! Meroni? Meroni? - Meroni! - Yes sir! Can you hear me?! Would you do me a favour? You're always so kind! I'm going out and I'm in a hurry, I forgot to leave this envelop in my office. Would you leave it on my desk please? Why myself? You know why Meroni, I appreciate and respect you! You are the only one I allow to get in my office when I'm out! You know what I mean? I trust you! Anyway, it doesn't matter, I will do it myself. I'm late but... No, no! Ok, I will! - Will you? - Yes, don't worry. You know what is this? This is "Team Work"! Thank you Meroni! Don't move, please! - Goodbye everyone! - Bye! "Team Work"! - And the bastards get promoted... - Fuck off! "The customer you are calling is not available at the moment..." I knew I shouldn't get in, I had to go downstairs, it was going upstairs... It's my fault, I'm so sorry. It's not your fault, I chose to get in. Maybe now you can take it easy, she said it's not your fault. Well, I didn't have to get in either... I have a big lack... I respect others too much. Were you doing something for your boss? How you know?! I'm sure your office is not at the 17th floor. And if you had to pee, there are toilets on the ground floor. I forgot an envelop that the boss asked me to leave on his desk. I thought, for a while, that Primigi had never really appreciated me. If he needs a favor, he always thinks at me. But if he has to promote somebody, it's always someone else. I should have done it tomorrow... but then I thought that maybe he was in a hurry, that maybe I could wreck something important, that maybe it was really important to have it tomorrow morning! ...that Primigi, that bastard, would have fired you. No! It's not like that. - You know young lady... - Please, call me Violetta. Ok! I've done it because I try to respect everyone, not for the fear of being fired. If you think I consider Primigi as a bastard, you're wrong. No, "l" think that. He's a fucking bastard. Who knows, maybe I was fated to get in this lift. To get stuck here? What a fucking fate! You still don't understand, there's no way with her, I know you want her to think you are a good guy and you're happy to be here now. But she can't appreciate guys like you. No, I... I tell you for the last time, Pittana you know what to do. Once you and Rodolfo are in, don't lose sight of anyone! Never! Marco, you gotta cover my ass when I'm in that room. Matteo, we've been working together for ten years. Maybe it's me who should cover your ass. I don't trust you. Why? Just 'cause he's your brother? I didn't say I trust him. I don't trust you anymore. - Maybe Luca's right. - Shut up! It's not time to talk. Yeah, let's stop it! We gotta think about what to do now. We'll talk about it later. We have already talked about this. Let's go! Excuse me, just a question. Don't move! Play it cool! Open the door! Come on, open it! Keep your temper, everybody! Switch off that fucking cell phone! Switch it off! You employees! Please... just do what I want you to do and nobody will get hurt! Stand up, everybody! You customers get down! Get down! Calm down! Calm down! Nobody wants to create problems here. Have you heard her? Throw that gun down! Throw it down, now! C'mon grandpa! Here it is, you see?! Here it is. Kick it! We all want to cooperate, right? Ok, if you wanna cooperate just tell me where you count the money! - The last room on your left. - Let's go. Calm down, we'll get out of here in five minutes! Calm down, these money are not yours. Calm down! Throw your guns down! Throw them down, now! Hey! What the hell are you doin', asshole! Don't move! I'll shoot you down! I'll shoot you down! I'm not kidding! Why? Just think, I got two friends behind you. If you shoot me, you're dead. It will work out badly for us, but also for you. Listen, give me the gun, let's put an end on it. You wont lose money. You'll just earn a fairy tale to tell your children. Trust me! Fuck you! Good, get back down. Get down, quickly! Shit! Stay here, don't move! Watch out! Don't move! Get down, grandpa! Don't move! I couldn't do anything, anything! Oh, God! - Nooooo! Matteo! - Let's get out of here! Now! I take it easy, I feel protected by you. You have values. You know, we risk everyday. We gotta void this risk. Absolutely. I gotta be sure that you'll always be covering my ass. What about Pittana? I don't trust him anymore, I know him well. Now it's your turn. Who's going to cover your ass must have characteristics such as: Bravery, experience... Pittana has more experience than me. ...but above all loyalty! And if I die? No, don't say that. Just in case... Just in case... I got a family, so I gotta consider any hypothesis. If I die, who will look after Marta and my daughter? Pittana? I doubt it. I know that you will do that. I know that you will fight 'till the end. Pittana has always been by your side, I can't boss him, Matteo. Yeah, but I can boss you. You know, I'm not betraying him. I'm enhancing one's value. And if Pittana wants to stay with us, he'd better accept that you will be the boss. You're making a big mistake. Pittana knows what to do. Hi, Luca! Leave us alone! According to an American statistics there's one hero every twenty bank robberies. One every twenty banks. We got two heroes in the same bank. It's a very remote possibility. How could we predict it? Don't try to justify me, it's my fault, I know that. Our contact didn't work. There was a hidden security guard. And nobody warned us! I chose the contact, I had to check the corridor. It's my fault, that's the truth. I quit thinking many years ago. I miss your brother. But this is not a thought, this is a feeling. See you later. Don't worry, we talked to the doctor... he wanted a lot of money but in the end he wrote on the report what we wanted. Don't worry. Hi Lisa. Your father told me that if he had died I had to look after you and your mother. Your mother doesn't want to talk with me. And you? You, you know... Sometimes we could hang out, maybe an ice cream... Fuck you. It's my fault. It's not your fault, we all know what my dad used to do. And so? My dad asked you to stand by us, not to feel forced to. You're a smart girl. You'll get through it. Half an hour has passed! Nobody's here, nobody's coming! You were talking to fucking whom?! They will. They must come. I can't stand it anymore, let's call someone else. I'll pay him, I don't give a fuck! Wait, let me see what happens. Hello? Pittana, what the fuck are you doin'! Oh sorry, I forgot to warn you. They called me, I talked to them, they're coming. There's a heavy traffic, it's the rush hour. Take it easy, they're coming, ok? What the fuck! It's not you who got stuck here, time is running out. Let us get out of here, ok?! Mancini, fuck! My battery is dead! That's ok, they're comin'. There's a bit of traffic. This party will get over very soon. No, I usually have parties at home, with my friends. and they are not guys like you. Here it is. It's Arabic mocha. Yeah, you're right, let's call other technicians. Ladies and gents, Brave Heart has returned! I understand you wanna be a hit with her, but here there's a servicing and an intervention file. Please, it's not time to look for the soul mate. What's up men? Is this a lift of psychiatrists? He's looking for the soul mate here? Maybe you don't know the kind of people that I hang out with. Yes, I know. Charmless rich men who treat you as a slut. Besides, you do your best to appear such. How dare you, asshole! Look at how you dress, at the confidence you parade. You fuck with the boss, isn't it? Actually I'm sure you're not the only one. I'm sure he fucks with some colleagues of yours! So you and Primigi... You know... you men are like each other. You think you are the best. You're a bog cleaner but you feel cooler than me. That's why you prefer staying with a powerful man? That's right. You know why you think we are like each other? You are not able to see the difference. - Look at this poor soul. - I'm not a poor soul! You worry so much to show her you are a good guy, but she's too pissed off to notice you. You are just what she thinks a man can't be: Resourceful, respectful, always ready to assume responsibilities and faults. But if you haven't got a Porsche she will never see you. How you know? Well, I judge what I see. No, how you know that he flirts with other colleagues? That's what you care about? It's always like that. Or better saying, since pussies around the boss are not so much, maybe she's a friend of yours. Someone you trust. Giada. Maybe you suggested her his favourite dirty jobs. Fuck you! Congratulations. That's your first sincere gesture. Hello, Guidi? Yes, it's me. Listen, I got stuck in the lift of the company, I've been here for one hour and nobody came over. I don't know, call someone! Ok, thank you! Yes. - What time is it? - It's late. Should we worry? Not yet. We'd better call him. What the fuck are you doin', asshole?! But... why? Borgia, what the fuck are you doin'?! A friend of yours is making a job, he's armed in a building! He's late and we don't know why, maybe he has problems. Maybe he's hiding, and you call him to the cell phone? Borgia you're an asshole! You're a stupid! Ok, I'm sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry! I got good intentions, I didn't mean to cock things up! So, no fucking initiatives! Some years ago, I got stuck in a abandoned house with a boy that I was hanging out with. We went there to make love. We didn't notice that the handle was broken. Luigi. You remind him actually! He was not so bad but... he was a bit feckless. Just about an hour later, we noticed a crack in the wall, I could pass through it. So I got out and I opened the door from outside. How stupid we were! But it was... funny! I always said that slim is better! - It's full of people here today! - Hi. I brought some flowers. Me too. Do you remember my offer? Once we had an ice cream near the Pincio, we had a good time. It was three years ago, dear uncle. I'm not a child anymore and you didn't notice that. My dad is dead, my boyfriend left me, and you wanna take an ice cream with me? Can we go to the zoo afterwards? Fuck off! What the fuck do you want? Don't you see how it ended up? I was wrong to trust you. Nothing for us and nothing for you. Draw! He went peeing, I can't check all guards' blisters! The money were at the right place and the door was open. So I do want my share! At 11 o'clock the bags of money arrive, at 11.30 they will placed in a room for the count. - There will be a few guards. - I know the plan. What I want to know is how much do you want. I don't want money. The area director of my company is a bastard. He found out that I stole "something" in the past. Small sums, little stuff. But he uses his evidences to keep me from going up the ladder. Plus, he uses me for his fucking political games. I'm sorry, we don't hurt anyone. I don't wanna hurt nobody, who do you think I am? So what do you want? I want his evidences against me. Then, I will be free. Primigi has got the documents testifying my little deductions in his office. The area management seat is made just of offices, it has a weak security service. Ok, we will get those documents. This is also what I thought at first, but it's too difficult. We don't know where he keeps them. His office is full of documents. We need too much time to find them. And we are not able to read them. I quit. Maybe all his documents could be destroyed... A fire? A bomb would be better! Lots of people could go under investigation! They would be free just like me, it's a good deed basically. And nobody will get hurt. You're crazy. I don't even know how to get a bomb! Come on! I bet you know the right people, just ask! Think about it, we're talking about a lot of money! Just for you. I don't want anything. I counted so much on it! I've already started playing my game. If you give up now, I'm ruined! We didn't get money and my brother is dead! That's the game. Sometimes you could get nothing. I wouldn't use the tape, I wouldn't... Which tape? The tape of the security camera. You split your hood off, do you remember? Didn't you ask yourself why the Police never found that tape? I'm sorry but I got no choice! I gotta eliminate those documents. So, if you put the bomb and I'll give you the tape. In the first race I wanna bet on Billo Boy and Passatore. Yeah. And in the second race I bet on Sylvester and Ton sur Ton. For the fourth don't forget Ugo and Hello Dolly. Ton sur Ton. It's a French word. Yeah. On the fifth I bet on Marchese and Zio Beb?. Ok. Don't forget Billo Boy. Ok, that's my stake. Goodbye, I'll call you back. Bye. So what? What's up? We need the bomb again. Ok, that's not a problem, we know who to call. But why? The bank manager... cheated us. No, she cheated me. What do you mean? She's got the tape. What the hell are you talking about? Which tape? There was a security cam in that room. And I slip my hood off. Maybe this job is not for me. Did she see the tape? Did she see this fucking tape?! - No, Pittana, she didn't. - How the fuck you know it? It was a one of those little tapes that can't be seen with ordinary video recorders. Anyway, who fucking cares about it! We all know what's recorded on it. Isn't it, Pittana? It's my fucking face! - And now this slut wants the bomb again? - Yeah! What we're gonna do now? We gotta put the bomb. I'll think about it, I'll organize this job. Ok? Hello, Guidi? Yeah, I've called the technicians, they could be there in five minutes, but the cost of the call is 120 euros... Ok, it doesn't matter, send them here. Ok. Thanks Guidi. Bye. That's strange. What Borgia? What's strange? You know, it was supposed to be a fast job but one hour has passed! Yo bro', you wanna help me please? 5 euros for 5 pairs of socks! We don't need them, go away! You are from Naples, just like me?! You'll certainly use them. 5 pairs 5 euros. - But I... - 5 pairs 5 euros! I understand, 5 pairs 5 euros! The problem is that my feet are always sweating so I prefer lisle socks. So why don't you buy a pair of wonderful cotton pants, I also have XXL size for you. So you can free your willy! How fucking dare you?! Come on bro'! So what should I say?! Today I didn't earn a cent! Now I gotta go back to my shitty home. - I don't give a fuck! - You're not so kind, fatty! - Listen pal, fuck off! - That's right! Hey man! Take this 10 euro and fuck off! - Thank you bro'. - Move! - Thank you so much. - Move... "Thank you, bro'!" "Thank you, bro'!" Now you understand why I cut along from Naples? Do you understand? Do you understand why I cut along from Naples? I cut along for people like you! Buy these socks, buy these pants... Fuck off! I don't wanna see them anymore, what should I do? Where should I go? In Norway? In New... Tasmania? He's the second today! There must be a sort of shelter for Naples refugees around here! - Hi Marta. - Hi Luca. Your husband's here? He's in the living room with his brother. Why did Marco came here so restless? What the hell are you up to? I don't know, they didn't tell me. Why? Now they're getting along well, they don't tell you anything anymore. Luca, it's time to stop risking! Lisa now understands everything, she feels ashamed at school. You can go on, but tell Matteo to stop it. Help me! I will talk to him, ok? Luca, the time has come for you to replace him! Matteo has already a lot of money. Pittana's always been by your side, I can't boss him, Matteo. But I can boss you. Listen, I'm not betraying him... I'm enhancing one's values. And if Pittana wants to stay with us, he must accept that you will be the boss. You're making a big mistake. Pittana knows what to do. Hi, Luca! Please, leave us alone. What do you mean? Matteo, do you wanna drive me out of the gang? No, I didn't say that, I said you're not ready to be the boss. - Is your brother ready? - Yes, he's ready. What a fucking bullshit! May I have a good reason, please? Luca, you're smart, competent... with a lot of experience, I know that. - But you're a coward. - What?! You're a coward! Matteo, what the fuck are you talking about? I've been never stopping at nothing in the last ten years! I've never had any fear, never! For ten years... I've been never scared from guns. - Exactly. - Exactly what? You shoot too much. You shoot too much... When we are in difficult situations, you always choose the easiest solution. 'Cause you're a chicken! Things always went smoothly Matteo, always! I've been covering your ass in my way. And I didn't have any problems, isn't it? Till now... but I'm afraid of future, I don't trust you anymore. You are crazy. You're really crazy, you don't understand... You're crazy about your brother! And you rave... Now I've told you the truth. You know, you got a good quality: smartness. When something goes wrong, you always choose the best alternative. And not only one! Five, ten, fifteen! But if the 15th doesn't work, you chose the 16th, but it doesn't work either. So you choose the 17th, which is the only solution. And maybe, who knows, the 17th could lead to death. Well, when your life is in danger, you scare to death and always opt for the easiest thing. I'm sorry Pittana, I can't trust you anymore. Shall I go now? Sure. - It's time for the plan 17. - What? I say it's strange... Too much time has passed. - What can I do, do I call him? - No, I told you before! So? I'll get in and take a look. You stay here, wait for me, don't move. Ok, but keep me advised, I'm in trouble. Don't move. Call me to the cell phone! Do you understand? Listen, do you trust him? Why? He seems everything but a cleaner. I wanna know who he were talking with. I'm so tired. I can't wait them to arrive. Shall I rest my head on your shoulder? Yeah. Shit! - "The customer you have called..." - Fuck! Pittana! Pittana! What is he doing? He's too smart for being a cleaner. Shit! Borgia, what about these fuckin' technicians?! Technicians? Technicians! Borgia, I got stuck in the lift just after the 13th floor! Listen to me... there are two bodies at the entrance... maybe they are the technicians you were talking about! I've lost Pittana, I'm worry about him! Yes, I'm goin' up! I don't know! There's nobody here! Yes, I'm calm! Wait! I hear a noise! I'm goin'up! Stay there! Yes, I'll bail you out, don't worry! But now I gotta watch out, 'cause I don't know what the fuck is happening here! Shit, Mancini! I've found Pittana! He lays on the floor, shit! He's covered in blood! I'll call you back! Borgia hold on! I still got the bomb! Which bomb?! Pittana... Hey, Pittana! Pittana! Oh, shit! Ok, time has come to tell ourselves who we really are. Three losers or three people who don't wanna die. Listen to me, inside this "bucket" there's a bomb that I don't know how to dismantle. We got half an hour left. Am I a criminal? A coward? Both of them, no doubt. I don't know... but now we gotta get out of here. If we survive you can even report me, if you want. But we gotta go now. What do you wanna do? Do you wanna call the Police? Or rather you wanna cooperate? Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! - "Hello, it's Police station..." - There's no time to call anybody. We gotta save our lives now. What's the plan? Alright, I can't do that. But if you could pass through the crack of the abandoned house, I'm sure you can even pass through that, I hope so. You gotta climb over cables 'till the first landing. Save my number. Call me when you reach the stairs and I'll tell you what to do. Tell me. 3936135771 What's your name? It doesn't matter, if you call me my number will stay in the memory. - Are you ready? - Sure! What a nice t-shirt! Come on, let's throw her up. Arms first! She got it, I was right! Give me the bomb! Please, be very careful. If it falls down the well, we're dead! Get out at the first door... remember, let the suitcase out first, carefully, and the you. Then call me and... You'll explain me later, pass me the bomb! No! the bomb stays here! Maybe you don't know that we got no time. It will explode before she'll unlock the lift to let us out. It's not her fault if we can't pass through the hole. Besides, it wasn't her who took the bomb here. Don't worry, I can do it! I'll take it out and I'll free you. It's a matter of probabilities. She puts the bomb in a dumpster and have all the time to free us. Timer doesn't wait. She can't climb the cables with that suitcase. We'll keep it here so she will climb quicker. Trust me. Ok, let's do it like that. So I'm going. Thank you. Will she come back? Yeah, she will. She likes you. Pittana! Pittana what the fuck happened? There's somebody into the building... somebody's here... Somebody who wants to stop us! What? Somebody who wants to stop us? Who's this person? Pittana! Shit! Pittana, get up! I was right, isn't it? Yes. Here I am, what am I gonna do now? Listen to me, I've studied this building. Go upstairs and get to the upper balcony where there's the control box of the lift. I'm going up! Pittana! Pittana, don't scare me! Pittana! Pittana! Come on, try to recover! Pittana! Pittana! Come on, come on! I don't know what to do! Mancini's still in the lift, I think he's still got the bomb! I'm in the corridor of the 15th floor, I'm going upstairs to the 16th. There's someone in the bathroom! Two men, what am I gonna do? I don't know what's happening. Just go upstairs. She's a woman, she's a girl. Maybe they could help us. Don't trust anyone, they don't gotta see you. Now we are alone, just go upstairs. She looks like an ordinary bitch. But she's a pro, do you know what I mean? What the fuck are you saying? Who's that girl? - Borgia? - Yeah. A woman has assaulted me. I'm going upstairs again. Did they see you? I don't know, Maybe. Ok, just go upstairs. She's upstairs trying to stop the lift. The lift has already stopped! There's Mancini with the bomb! I don't know what she fucking wants! Borgia, she's dangerous. She has killed the technicians. Borgia you gotta go upstairs, you gotta find her and kill her! - Me?! Are you crazy?! - Do you think I can do that?! I can't keep still! I feel dizzy... What the fuck can I do? What about the bomb? Hurry up! It's gonna explode! Borgia, you gotta go upstairs and kill her! What the fuck...! Ok, ok, I will! I'm on the 17th floor, the stairs are over! Open the door of the balcony. Yeah! - It's locked! - Shit! Ok, listen to me. Boss's office has another door to it. - Go there! - Ok! Shit! It's locked! Ok, calm down. We gotta create a short-circuit. What? There's a keyboard for the safety blockage near the door. Ok! Now? - 13548! - What? The code! 13548! Primigi trusts me. 13548. Enter it and the door will open! Hello?! - What the fuck! What's her name? - Violetta. Violetta, what's up? Violetta, what's up? Who are you? No, you, who the fuck are you?! I'm... an employee! I got stuck in the lift. What the fuck are you saying? Are you kidding me?! If you got stuck in the lift what the fuck are you doing here?! Violetta, what's up?! There's a man who has tried to shot me down! He's pointing his gun at me. Who's that man? I don't fucking know! Who are you? I'm your uncle! Describe him! He's... He's a fatty! Borgia! Let me talk with him. - He wants to talk with you. - With me? Yes! - Hello? - Borgia, it's me! Hey it's you?! What's up? Why did you fucking shoot? She's ok? This girl has killed two people. Pittana said she's a pro! Pittana's fucking lying! I don't know this slut, I know Pittana! Listen to me Borgia, I've been sticking here for an hour. Pittana knows it, I called him. Did he tell you? No, he told me nothing at all. Right. He said he called the technicians, is it true? No, I don't think so. I don't understand what's fucking going on here! Trust me Borgia, Pittana is betraying us. I don't know why but he's betraying us! Or better still, he's betraying me. With a bomb that's going to explode in this fucking lift. Borgia? Borgia, are you there? Shit! Mancini, he's coming here. Ok, hold on. Let the girl get up. Wait for Pittana and don't let him pass. Don't ever let him get out! Ok? Yeah, how can I do that? I don't know! Hide behind the door and don't let him pass. Ok, ok! Here I am. I'm behind the door. Are you sure? Are you well hidden? Maybe your belly peeps out. It's not time to talk about my belly, Mancini! I said I'm hidden, trust me. Ok. Give the phone to the girl. Here you are. Hello. Now get in the office. "He's fatty"... Slut! Here I am. Well, there must be another door. - Yeah. - Open it. I'm opening it! Ok, go upstairs to the balcony. There are two flights left. I'm on the balcony! There must be the control box of the lift. - Yeah! I can see it! - Go there! Ok. Here I am. It's locked! There must be a key on the wall. Here it is. I'm in! What I gotta do now? Ok! Do you see the engine? Press the lever. Which one? There's a lever on the lift engine, press it! She quit. It's a video call! This one? Yeah, that one. Now hold it and rotate the wheel. Borgia? Borgia? What's up? Are you still there? Yes. Come on, keep on pulling! Pittana? Why? I thought we were friends! Come on! Time is running out! Come on! We got it! Stop it! Hello? I've been cut off. We can pass here! - Great, open the door! - Ok! - Come on! - Hold on! Hurry up! - Be careful. - Ok! Let's drop the bomb out of here! No, I gotta finish my job. Get out, if you want! No, I gotta save the girl. Let's go! Who's him? Dear Borgia... - Open the door! - Ok! Get down. Move! Shit! Go behind the pillar! Hide behind that pillar! Throw that fucking gun! Throw that fucking gun, Mancini! Or I'll blow out her brain! Throw it down! Now kick it as you know! Well done, Mancini. I knew I could count on your kind-heart. You refer to her or something? I don't give a fuck, kill her! Yeah. And then kill me. But one thing first, Pittana. Tell me why. For your brother, Mancini. For your brother! 'Cause your brother used to call me chicken! Matteo? What's got to do with it? He's dead. I got no time to explain, I'm sorry. I gotta get those fuckin' documents! Documents? That's not your business! It's my stuff! The tape... - Why do you wanna get that tape? - Don't get too close! What's recorded in that tape, Pittana? Do not get too close or I'll kill the both of you. Good idea, kill her! So that I can face you! Come on! Shoot! Shoot! Come on! Why don't you shoot?! We got no time, shoot! Shoot! I think you're gonna wait here Pittana... You're such an asshole! He could have killed me! It was not possible. We had an ace up our sleeve. The Prince Charming. Let's go! Come on! C'mon! Let's go! - Where's the bomb? - I've left it upstairs. Now Pittana is the only one in danger. What about Primigi's office! We don't give a fuck, Primigi is a bastard! You're right. Oh my God! Now you can call the Police if you want. Now you can call the Police if you want. There's no need. They'll be here after the bang. I suggest you to run away before they arrive. You didn't understand what's going on, it would be a drag to you. Oh my God! I forgot to leave the envelop on Primigi's desk! It doesn't matter, at least one thing is still save! Listen, can I take a look to those documents? Come on! Unbelievable! These are documents I had to eliminate. I'll take it. They would think they got burnt in the fire, nobody will think about you. Alright. Bye. What's up? Are you thinking about those documents? No. You know, I wouldn't have shot. You saved my life. You too. Alright, so... see you at work! Now I'm going to take my bus. Bye. So, don't you like me at all? C'mon, I'll give you a ride. - Thank you. - Fuck you! To: Rome Police Headquarters - Hello? - Hi, Lisa. Hi. Just one thing: don't be sad if your boyfriend has left you. Why? Just an idiot could leave a cupcake like you! Thanks dear uncle. Your ice cream offer is still valid? Sure... Bye. Bye. Don't move! Keep your hands on your head! What the fuck have you done?! What the fuck!
