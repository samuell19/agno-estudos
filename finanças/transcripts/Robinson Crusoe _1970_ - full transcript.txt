Ten days after setting sail from the Coastline of Brazil to Africa, and being in the position 7 degrees 22 minutes north, we got caught up in a violent hurricane that diverted us for nine days until our ship ran aground and stopped. As there wasn't any hope to save our ship, we abandoned it before it would shatter. Eleven of us embarked the one boat, but our situation didn't get better. We were surprised by a gigantic wave and we sank. It is impossible for me to describe my confusing thoughts while I was drowning. I only know that suddenly I was in front of this mast and I clung into it with all I had left. If not for that mast, I'm sure I would have died. Thank you, God. Thank you. The important thing is not to leave everything to fate, but to do your best to move forward. The Bible says: "God helps those who help themselves." That's exactly what I'm trying to do. But how? I don't know where I am nor where I should go. Is this an island or a continent? Is this region inhabited? Although I don't want to think about it, I realize this is the first time in my life that I feel the anxiety caused by solitude. My situation is deplorable. I don't have much. I just have my knife, my two hands... the old and inseparable pipe my father gave me eight years ago after his departure, and some wet tobacco. It is now that I understand that with this supplies I have no chance to survive. I can't give up before I start fighting. I have to make fire. If I do it, perhaps a ship might see it. I achieved my first goal. I must not lose faith even though I know it is useless as I am far away from navigation routes. I won't give up on my hope of being rescued. I must be patient and know how to wait. I begin my first day with a tremendous appetite. First I will eat something, then I will explore the rest of the day. I fear this territory might be inhabited by wild cannibals. Fortunately, this region is rich in coconut palm trees. With these coconuts I can quench my thirst. I still haven't found fresh water around here. The coconut's pulp, even though it's not good food, helps me calm my hunger until I find something to eat. I tied up some logs with vines to improvise a raft. Right now I think the best option I have to leave this jungle is to navigate downriver until the sea, where I would be safer, and it would be easier to find food. Being again in front of the sea makes me feel more calmed and it brings me back my hope of surviving. I know that if I'm lucky, it'll be easy for me to catch a pair of lobsters. I decided to make a spear to hunt and to defend myself. Upon gazing the wounded deer before sacrificing it, I remembered all the times I almost lost my life. This deer wouldn't solve my problem, so I decided to set it free. I realized that it belonged to my ship. Maybe I could find a comrade, or supplies. I had to look everywhere, I couldn't waste any second. We ran aground! We're getting shipwrecked! We're going to sink! We have to get out of the ship! Let's take the boats! I've been in this island for 14 days. I have visited 12 times the stranded boat. The hurricane blew furiously through the night. In the morning, when I got out of the trench I had built, I was astonished. It was surprising not to see the ship. Even though I had taken out all I could use from it, I wanted to keep on visiting it. Nevertheless, I realize I should consider myself a lucky man for rescuing everything I have. Now all that worries me is to be safe from all the wild animals and the wild men, if there is any. I decided to explore the area and look for the right place to set my dwelling and to store my treasures so they didn't run any danger. I found out I was on an island in the middle of nowhere. Soon I realized that my trench wasn't set in the right place as it was in a low and swampy area. From this hill, I could see everything. It would be the best place to defend myself, but there was no fresh water nearby. Besides, I would be far away from sea, and I still had the hope of spotting a ship on the horizon that would set me free from my captivity, from my isolation, my loneliness. I think this is the first gunshot ever heard in this region since the Creation. I had to find food by any means necessary without running out of supplies. I needed to surround the place that I choose to live with all kind of traps. It wasn't easy to kill it. I understood how terrible and destructive can a man be with a firearm. Many thoughts crossed my mind about the kind of dwelling I would build, and how was I going to build it. If I surrounded it with a fence, simulating a fortification, I would get enough security to protect the cave entrance where I would store my supplies, which are invaluable for me. It was difficult to choose between digging a cave or building a hut, so I decided to have both. I finally found the right place. First thing I needed to do was to explore the cave. After I finished the fence, I thought that if I was my own bait, I could hunt animals by making them fall into my traps. That would help me eliminate the wild animals near my camp without spending my ammunitions. It took me a lot of work to capture it alive, so I decided not to kill it. I discovered on the other side of the island a beach where hundreds of turtles would lay their eggs. Thanks to this, I found a way to feed the tiger. We had enough food for a banquet. I realized that if I continued with this, I could tame it, and there would be no more fear between us. I kept visiting the turtle beach for weeks with the purpose of keeping the tiger's belly full. I thought that doing this would make us friends. I considered it was time to take it out of the trap. Although I feared it would attack me at any moment, this was the only way I had to start taming it. I was now sure that soon enough the tiger would be my inseparable partner. I arrived at this coast on September 30th, 1659. I made my own calendar so I won't lose track of time. I carved each day with my knife. I would carve a longer line each Sunday, and a double one the first day of every month. This day was my first anniversary on this island. This day I also finished the hut and the fence. After 365 days of looking at the horizon waiting for a human being, I suddenly felt that I would never see men again. My body started to shiver. I would die alone and far away from my kin. A frightening thought invaded my consciousness the night before. "What if I get sick in this solitude?" Would it be possible that this fear was the cause of my situation? Once again, I say my prayers to God, but I feel so weak, and in this moment of lucidity, I'm so ignorant that I can only cry out, "Lord, look at me." "Lord, have mercy on me." "Lord, help me." I felt better when I realized it was only a nightmare, but I was worried about the vision of my death. As I knew that my fever could go up, I remembered that the natives would take tobacco as medicine, and that in one of the chests there was tobacco completely cured and not cured. I ignored how to use it. I thought in two ways, chewing it or drinking it with rum. The bawling of an animal that fell into a trap made me go out. I was fortunate. I had captured a goat, and thanks to that, I didn't run out of rice and barley from the ship. A few minutes never felt so long before eating something. Especially, such an exquisite meat that I also needed to regain strength after my fever. Although a big banquet awaited me, the vision of that white ghost with my face was still on my mind, and now I could see it reflected in the flames. The first time I planted, no grain germinated because the ground wasn't damp enough to help the seeds grow. I blamed on the lack of water for my failure. After the storm, the ground was humid. I considered it was time to try again to plant some rice and barley. It was a lot of work. I felt tired, but happy for having accomplished the task of planting this grains. I felt something strange in the air. The sky was reddish and the air felt dense. No noise from animals or birds could be heard. The sea started to look as a lake. Nothing happens without God's will. He wanted all of this to happen to me. I have no one to talk to and ease my loneliness, but I'm alive and I didn't drown as the others. The one who saved me from death can still save me from this situation. "Call upon me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me." I wanted to return to my dwelling as soon as possible. I was afraid that the earthquake would have destroyed everything. Part of the fence was destroyed. My heart had skipped a beat. I had lost my tiger. My only friend. For quite a time, I decided to make several pans out of soil or clay to store liquids and more. I used all kind of methods to make them, but all of them broke as they didn't resist the sunshine nor the liquids. Finally, after two months of hard work, I was able to finish two of them. During my third year, with great satisfaction, I had made some necessary objects, such as pans, baskets, and now, my first loaves of bread. These loaves of bread were the result of my plantation and my hard work. My first loaf of bread was my most resistant brick. For the first time, I admired the bakers from my hometown. Each human has a mission and a profession to accomplish. Studying and constantly applying the Word of God, and with His Grace, I got a different perspective at the end of my fourth year. The world became remote, and I didn't expect nothing from it. As Abraham, I could say: "Between me and you, a great chasm has been fixed." I was away from any human wickedness. I felt no lust, greed, nor vanity. I had no ambitions for I already had everything I needed. In England, or in any city of the world, a person like me would seem scary or funny to their citizens. But I felt satisfied with my outfit and my umbrella, which was what I needed the most, after my rifle. Even though I didn't like risking my life, I was feeling a rising concern that made me walk around the island. I had walked quite a distance. Suddenly I stopped. I was thunderstruck, as if I had seen a ghost. I got closer to the footprints to convince myself they were real. I had no doubt. Those were the footprints of a human being. I ran as fast as I could. I imagined that every tree or scrub was a man lying in wait for me, and I was overcome with fear. I climbed in as if I was been followed by enemies. My panic was bigger than a cat's being followed by dogs. I was ready to defend myself. It was time to face the most dangerous beast, the man. I was happy that I had my fortress where it wouldn't be easy for them to kill me, for I could shoot all my guns in less than three minutes. I couldn't sleep that night. The longer I waited, the bigger my terror was. My fears worried me that much, that I was carried along by my imagination. I thought it was the Devil himself who left those footprints. I was desperate. I wanted my enemy to show up so I could face him. How could someone else be here in this island? Where was his ship? Were there more footprints? How could a man be in the island without me noticing? My enemy must have been as dangerous as Beelzebub, surely one of the wild men dragged by the current and the wind. I was grateful I wasn't there when he disembarked. Or when they disembarked. There could be many of them. This increased my fear. If they discovered the island was inhabited, they would try to kill me and eat me, and they would take my house, my goats and my supplies. The noise I heard came from where I had my traps. If my enemy had fallen into a trap, I only needed to finish him off. As courageous as I could be, I got out of the fence. How strange is the life of men. How much we change from one moment to another depending on circumstances. Today we love what we might hate tomorrow. Today we search what we'll reject in the future. We want now what we'll have tomorrow. I am an example of all of that. My biggest affliction was being away from men, and now I was shaking by the proximity of a human. I was willing to hide if I saw the shadow of the silent man who was in the island. I wanted to think that those footprints came from my own feet. After a lot of thinking, I concluded that the island was not as abandoned as I thought. Even though it wasn't inhabited, it was visited by people from another continent that had a special purpose or that was dragged by the current to my island. I had been here for 15 years without seeing any other man. But there wasn't any proof to say no one ever came here. I guess they would come and go. I thought my only danger was been seen by the wild men. I used all the means that God gave me to avoid being caught by surprise. I was stunned by what I saw. All my fears were buried by my thoughts in the presence of such an evil and infernal brutality. I was moved by the horror I felt for this decadence. I never thought I was going to face something like this. I felt better regarding my security. I realized the cannibals never visited the island in search of what they already had. With no doubts, they were here, and found nothing interesting. Every night I thought of ways to eliminate the cannibals while they were doing their thing. Would it be possible to save the victim they'd bring along? I had to be present when they disembarked. But what could one man do against 20 or 30 armed men with bows and arrows, as skilled as me with my rifle? Once I thought about digging a hole below where they set their fire, and putting some gunpowder on it. But I only had one barrel, and I didn't know if it would blow up when I wanted. So I discarded that plan and I decided to lay in ambush in a convenient place with my rifles and attack on them. From here, I could observe the movements of my enemies. Even though I tried, I couldn't distinguish if they were men or women. I thought it was my last minute alive. I could have killed two of them, but not the eight of them. If I was lucky, and the others left, they would return with backup to kill me. They didn't use to visit my island very often. I waited a lot to face them and now I was letting them go. Remembering what I saw on the beach, blood, bones, and devoured bodies by those cannibals, caused me such indignation that I decided to destroy their next departure without worrying about their identities or their quantity. My camp was the only place where I felt safe. Many years without being discovered by the cannibals. My life was organized in such way that I had everything I needed. Nevertheless, I always had the idea of escaping from the island. If only I could take a boat from the cannibals, I would escape. But what would happen to me when I arrive at their country? What would be my destiny? Coming back to the civilization was a recurring idea. With this determination, I constantly watched the coast. One day, I was surprised to see five canoes on the beach, exactly where I was. I was surprised to see the prisoner run desperately. I prayed he could escape from all of them, but I was frozen when I saw him come towards me. He wanted to tell me with signs to exhume those bodies so we could eat them. No. Friday. You are Friday because you arrived on a Friday. Friday. Friday. Friday. Friday. -Friday. -Friday. Master. Master. Master. -Master. -Master. Master, Friday. Master... -Master, Friday. -Master, Friday. Master, Friday. -Master, Friday. -Well done. My son. Master. Master. The constant struggle to survive on a desert island, against all elements, exiled from humanity, and away from society. No hope of being rescued. These are examples of how men, without need of war or violence, only with hard work and willpower, can accomplish everything, no matter how awful his situation is. I was happy. I had learnt to value a human being. I had a partner to share my life with. Years later, we were rescued, but we returned and populated this island. I baptized it "The Desperation Island."
