The water’s hot. Oh, excellent! I love getting a bath. - It makes my fur so silky smooth. - Yeah! - Me first! - No, me first! - No, not you! Wait a minute! Gah! I hate baths. just the same, Scamp, when you live in a house, you need to be clean. Well, then I’m glad I’m a wild dog. Scamp, you know you’re not supposed to climb on the furniture. Now, get down from there before you break something. Hey, let’s do some dog stuff, huh, Pop? You know, dig up bones... rip up flowers, chase cats. Scamp, come on now. You’re gonna make a mess. - Got it! - Dad! Tramp? I hope you’re not making a mess in there. All right, whirlwind. Time to settle down. Why don’t you go play with junior? Scamp play ! Scamp! Look what you did to my favourite hat. If I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a thousand times, no! Let’s see if you can behave long enough for me to give you a bath. Whoo-oo. Bad Scamp. Scamp, stop squirming. Bad Scamp. Bad, bad, bad Scamp. Well, it's about time you settled down. - There. All done. - Scamp! Play ball! Hey, come back here ! Scamp, catch the ball. Come back here now ! No, no, no, no, no, no! Yea! Yea! Scamp! Scamp, whee! - Whee! Play ball! - Scamp! Oh, no. - What a mess. - Uh-oh. This time you've gone too far. You've left me no choice. Some dogs just have to learn the hard way. May be chaining you up will teach you a lesson. I'm sorry, pal... but I just don't know what else to do. - Serves him right. - Simply incorrigible. - He brought this on himself. - Now we'll need another bath. - Me first! - No, me first! - You first! I mean, no, no, no-- Tramp? Best thing Jim Dear could have done for our boy, chaining him up. Oh, Tramp, he's never been chained up before. He's just a pup. He has to learn to live by the rules of the house. Firm discipline moulds a pup into a dog. - You turned out pretty good. - Yeah, Pidge, but I found you. And if it weren't for you, I'd have wound up in the pound. I'm just trying to protect him. He'll understand some day. May be he needs to understand today. I thought you might be hungry. I'm sorry, pal. You're just gonna have to shape up a little, that's all. I always get blamed for everything. Sometimes it's hard being part of a family. You have to obey certain rules. But I want to run wild and free like a real dog. Son, the world out there is full of traps. Here, you-- you have a family that loves you. As long as I do what you say. Pop, I just don't feel like I belong here. Didn't you ever feel this way? I was just like you when I was your age. You were never like me. You've been a house dog all your life. How would you know? Oh, you'd be surprised. Scamp, I'm only trying to protect you. - Like putting me on a chain? - Those are the rules, son. All I ever hear is, ''Rules, rules, rules''! ¡''Don't do this'' and ''Don't do that''! Well, what good are teeth and, and claws if you can never use them? - Stop that how ling! - I can't help it, Pop! Wild dogs how I at the moon! There will be no wild dogs in this family! Then may be I don't want to be in this family! Like it or not, you are a part of this family. And until you start acting like it, you can just get used... to being out here every night! Hey, Angel! Huh? Why don't you come on out, 'Kay? I can't. - The pup is in chains. - Come back, you mangy mutt! Hold still so I can take you in all peaceable-like. Hey ! Where'd you go? Ah. What the-- Hey, drop that! Defacing a county officer's-- Oh, come on now. That's no fair. Come on now. Hand it over, girl. Hey ! Oh, that-- Hey, drop that! Hey, gotcha! it's off to the pound with you, big fella. Huh? Boy, when I get outta here, I’m gonna do something fierce. I'm gonna get you-- You little mutt! You're gonna see what mad is! I'll get you yet, you hooligans! Oh, come on! Far from here is where I want to be Somewhere out there loose and running Nobody's leash to hold me Nobody's hugs to crush me Nobody's soap and scratchy comb To bathe and brush me A world without fences Where I can run free And be with real dogs Who'll bring the real dog out in me No walls and no boundaries Where I can be free A world without walls and fences That's exactly Where I want to be This pup just won't sleep his life away On some sofa like his father Too many bones to chew up Too many smells to sample Too many fancy flower beds to rip and trample No rules to control me Stop what I want to be A world without fences That's the world I want for me No rules, no responsibility On my own, completely free A world without fences For me So long, you house dogs! You can't tell me what to do any more, 'cause I'm a wild dog. Hey, you guys, wait for me! Pretty good pickin's, huh? Hmm, I can see you know your way around an alley. It's that obvious? Couldn't miss it if I tried. This must be your diploma from the school of hard knocks. Yeah. I, uh, just graduated. Then you must know this move. Any street dog would. Wow ! Slick move. I mean, that's kid stuff. Yeah, right. You've got your own style, don't you, tenderfoot? Listen, you don't belong on the street. You won't last five minutes out here. Huh? Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey, you get out of the street! Scamp, I-- Scamp? Oh, no. Tramp! They're jumping on the sofa ... and playing in the trash. And, and breaking stuff! If only there were hats to chew on. Goodbye, chains! Hello, freedom! Go, Buster! That a way, Buster! Bust his butt off, Buster! So, any of you other low life mongrel ls... think you're dog enough to take Buster on? Don't be afraid! Have no fear! Have no fear! That's right, boys, junkyard dogs rule this town! And Buster rules the junkyard dogs! Angel! Angel! Talk to me. Who's the king of the junkyard ? Oh, you are, Buster. And it's quite a kingdom you've got here. - That's my girl. - I'm not your girl. I don't belong to anyone. Hey, hey. Look here, you guys. I'd say we got a new recruit. - The little house dog. - Hey, you got off the leash! Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ! Watch it! Oh, be still, my heart. I'm gettin' a bad case of puppy love. Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, Ruby. I'm the top dog around here. And nobody joins the junkyard dogs unless I say so. So, what's your name, sport? Name's Scamp. Well, howdy, Scamperoo. So, you saw us having some fun and thought you'd join right in, huh? - Yeah, sure. - Hey, I hate to break the news to ya, champ... but not many house dogs get to run in this pack. - I'm not a house dog. - Oh, you're not? Then what's this badge of respectability hangin' around your neck? - Hey, collar boy ! - How's life on the end of that chain? No way ! I've had it with the house dog life. Nothing there but rules, rules, rules. I want to be wild and free like you guys. I don't know, kid. Your average house dog ain't got what it takes. Yeah, tell him what it takes, Buster! Tell him what it takes! In junkyard society We're repelled by all propriety Humility and modesty Good manners and sobriety We always gulp our meat Our coats are never neat Alas, we lack all poise We're full of natural noise No pets you stroke and pat You might as well be a cat In junkyard Society Society We are the mutual unelite An underclass from our head to feet Our deeds are spiteful our mischief pure We got a natural disorder For which there's no cure Down to the junkyard Straight to the junkyard Step to the junkyard Society rag That's where you're nobody's perfumed pet Where you can wet where you want to wet Where you put charity on the shelf The only one that you'll look out for Is you yourself Down in the junkyard Check out the junkyard Doin' the junkyard Society rag No distemper shots from the vet - Show your temper - Mean as you can get Down at the yard where we live and let Chaos and trouble Oh, we do it double None of this play-it-safe house dog stuff Our days are risky Our nights are ''ruff'' The peaceful life leaves us ill at ease We're crude and loud in a crowd and very proud of our fleas Oh, I love this guy ! Down at the junkyard Check out the junkyard Step to the junkyard Straight to the junkyard Doin' the junkyard - Sing it, boy ! - Society Rag What a blast! I'd never get away with this at home. So you really think you got what it takes to be a junkyard dog, huh? He's got what it takes, Buster. I saw all his moves back in that alley. - Huh? - Yeah, yeah. Watch this slick move. Talented as you are, it ain't that easy, sport. Every day out here is like a test of survival. - A test! Beautiful! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Good! Baby, I always get my best ideas when you're around. - That's why you're my girl. - I'm not your girl. Okay, Scampers, we'll give you a shot... but you gotta pass a little test of courage in Reggie's alley. - What? Reggie's alley? - But it's never been done before. Come here. Don't listen to them. I got faith in you, kid. It's just a little test to prove you could stand on your own four paws. Easy. I'm not afraid of anything. That's what I like about you, kid. You got spunk. - Did you call the pound? - Yes, dear. They haven't seen him. Oh, Tramp. Scamp's never been out all night. - So much could happen. - Hey, easy, Pidge. We'll find him before he gets himself in real trouble. Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am! We came as soon as we heard . Oh! Och! Och! Uncle Jock! Uncle Trusty ! Scamp ran away ! - What they said! - Not to worry, little ladies. Got my grandpappy Ol' Reliable's... keen sense of smell. Say, have I ever told you girls... about the time I saved your father from certain death? - No! - No! - Yep! Och! Here he goes again. I told you, there'll be no livin' with him. That Scamp is going to get into so much trouble when he gets home. - Yeah. - Hmph! I don't even want him back. Yeah. Who cares? He should know better than to run off. I bet he gets a slipper right across his great, big, fat, uh-- Uh, we really do miss him, Mom. We'll be back with your brother in no time. Your old man's got twice the speed and cunning as any dog half his age. just using a few forgotten muscles, that's all. Lady, Tramp, let's go. Come on. No tellin' what mischief that pup's gettin' into. All right, Scampster. Fetch the can out of the alley. See ya! - It's a spook! A spook! - It's Reggie! Scatter! Where, oh, where has my little dog-- We ll, I'll be. You're not gettin' away this time. I got you now, you little hoodlum. Hey ! Hey, now, get off of there ! Whoa! What are you, mad? You crazy-- Aah! That'll get ya hard time in the pound, fella-- attacking a deputy animal control officer's vehicle. And a fine modern machine like this one at that. Two horsepower, three miles to the gallon, boy. Hey. You saved my life. Nobody else here would have dared to do that. - Wow ! Did you see that? - Is it possible? Scamp is a canine hurricane. You did everyone a big favour, 'Kay? Oui. You are practically the hero. -Shouldn't we go after him or something? -Hey, hey, hey, hey. You got it all wrong, kid. In the junkyard , it's every dog for himself. I can see we're gonna have to put you to another test. Any-Anything you say, Buster. - Will somebody open this thing? - Okay, okay, okay. - Is that open enough? - Magnifique, Mooch. - That's using your head. - Thanks again, huh? You, uh, comin', tenderfoot? I hit the thingy. This is great. This is living. I never get to do this at home. Whoo-hoo! After I pass my next test, I’m gonna be... the best junkyard dog there ever was! I don't think so, doll. You may be good... but you'll never be as good as the master. - Ah, here we go. - Ruby's right, carnsarnit. In my day, there was only one stray by which all dogs was measured. - The Tramp. - Huh? What? He taught Buster everything there is to know about being on the streets, 'Kay? Buster's trouble was Tramp's trouble. And Tramp's trouble was Buster's trouble, 'Kay? That dog was a prize, the one that got away. - Got away from me, at least. - Got away with everything! I heard he once stole an entire meat wagon, 'Kay? Yeah, and then the dog catcher chased him all the way to the river. No, sir. It was dog catchers. - Uh, how many? - At least a dozen. - Hey ! - Two dozen. Now that I think about it, the police and the army cavalry... were after the boy as well. He was trapped. But if the Tramp was gonna go... he was gonna go in style. So what happened? We never saw him again after that. They say when the wind blows... you can still hear the Tramp howl. - Wow ! - All right, all right. That is not what happened. He met this girl, see? Queen of a kennel club set. Even her prissy little name... still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Lady. But he met his true love. He betrayed me! You can't have a family and still be a junkyard dog. So I gave Tramp a choice. It's either me or her. And he picked life on the end of a chain. Hooked up with a real powder puff. Sleepin' on carpets. Free room and board ! Livin' the cushy pillow life ! And that's when I learned the first rule about being a junkyard dog: Buster's trouble is Buster's trouble. Hey ! Hey, hey, hey ! The Tramp used to scratch like that. - You ain't re related, are ya? - Who, me? No way ! Good. 'Cause if you were, you'd be kibble. Right, Buster. No way, Dad. That can't be true. You gave it all up? I mean, what could be better than this? - You okay, tenderfoot? - Who, me? Yeah. Yeah, sure. What are you doing out here? Don't you have a nice family back home? Wh-Wh-What difference does it make? All families are alike. They make you take baths and sleep in a bed... and, and you have to eat everything in your bowl. And when it rains, you have to come indoors. Ah. Let's just say you're lucky you've never had to live with a family. - Wrong again, tenderfoot. - You mean, you had a family? Actually, I've had five families. - I always thought one was too many. - I could never get one to stick. Someone would take me in, and just when I'd start to think. .. ''Wow, this is my family''... they'd move or have a new baby... or have an allergy. Same old story, I’m out on the street. Wait a minute. You really want a family, don't you? - But you've got Buster. - Buster! You can't tell him. You can't. - He'll kick me out. - Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. - I promise. - Thanks. So, I guess you're Buster's girl, huh? I am not Buster's girl! I don't belong to any body. The junkyard dogs aren't much of a family, but what choice do I have? What more do you need? As a junkyard dog... - you can stay up late or dig or-- - Run. - Yeah. Or, or play or dig or-- - Run. - Right. Or chase squirrel is-- - No! I mean, run! Whoo! Come on! Angel! Angel! Angel, help! Now would be a good time! Hurry! Scamp? Scamp! Scamp! Where are you? Scamp? Scamp! Excuse me. I'm looking for-- I-- I think I’m on to somethin'. Aye? Are you sure? I have most assuredly got him! This way. Come on, Pidge. - Oh, look! - Scamp! Oh, please. Scamp! Thank goodness. A wig! Och, you smelled a wig, man! - You're hopeless. - Oh. I'm sorry, Miss Lady. Come on. We've gotta keep searching. Och! I shouldn't have been so hard on him. - Hey. - Oh. Scamp? - Eh. - You're all right. I was so worried-- - So worried? - Yeah, right. Get over yourself, house pet. There's gotta be a better way to take a bath, huh? Trust me, there is no good way to take a bath. Wow ! That is so weird . How'd you do that? - Talent. - Let me try. Oh, that was smooth. - You really are a house dog. - Oh, yeah? - You're weird . - Uh, no, you're the weird one. - Oh, yeah? - Scamp. I never had this feeling before She gives me shakes and shivers I can't ignore And I see that there's more now Than just running free I never felt my heart beat so fast I'm thinking of him first and of my self last And how happy I want him to be It's amazing someone in my life just might be loving me I didn't know that I could feel this way It's so crazy Something in my life Is better than a dream I didn't know that I could feel this way She makes me warm and happy inside He smiles, and I get dizzy and starry-eyed All these feelings I have Have me asking Can this be love Can this be love - It's crazy - I can hardly speak - Whenever she - Whenever he Says hi I didn't know that I could feel I never dreamed that I could feel I didn't know that I could feel This Way Whoa, nice neighbourhood. Snob Hill. Hey, Jim Dear never leaves this gate open. - Come on, Tramp. - Oh, no! We gotta get outta here. Why? What's wrong? Come on, boy. We've done all we can for one day. Oh, we'll find him. You were the best street dog there ever was. And I still have faith in the old Tramp. Old Tramp? Hmph. If only the old Tramp was still here. Come on, Tramp! We'll find Scamp tomorrow. - The Tramp is your father? - I, um-- Wait. No, wait! Angel, wait! - Did you find him? - May be tomorrow. Scamp. Bad Scamp. - Gosh, I didn't think they'd miss me that much. - You didn't think they'd miss you? I can't believe you'd run away from a home like this. - Well, you don't know what it was like. - No, I don't. Whoo, must have been horrible having someone care about you that much. I need to be wild and free. I'll never find that here. I'd give anything to have what you have. And I'd give anything to have what you have. Come on, Scamp. We could run off together. We don't need them. Angel, don't you understand? Only one more test, and I'll finally be a junkyard dog. - That's where I belong. - No, you don't belong there. You're better than that, Scamp, and that's what I like about you. Come on, tenderfoot. Let's go. - Wow ! - Wow ! Look! I really think we should keep searching. Oh, nonsense!it's the Fourth of July. Time to have some fun. You can continue your search after our picnic. Aunt Sarah, we're not really in the mood to celebrate. Oh, come now. Scamp will be all right. You'll find him. But, first, let's eat. I won't have my Fourth of July ruined by that little Scamp. There, there, boy. I knew it. Beautiful. Scampo! Front and centre. Take a look out there. See that family? You-- You mean that family over there? No, this family right here. Now, as your final test, I want you to infiltrate their picnic... and liberate their chicken... right out from under the nose of that meek, little house dog. You don't have to prove anything, Scamp. just walk away. - Since when do you care so much? - I thought you were better than this. Pipe down, Angel cakes! Come on, kid. You wanna be wild... and free, don't you? All it's gonna cost you is one juicy chicken. Yeah, I should've known. Once a house dog, always a house dog. I'm no house dog! Scamp back! Oh, my goodness! Oh! - Scamp! - Monster! - Scamp back! Scamp back! - Oh, my poor-- - Scamp wanna play ! - Scamp? - Come back! - Where him go? - It's chow time, boys! Aha! You-- You little mutt! I won't forget you! I'll lock you in the pound! I swear it! - Slick move. Lost him. - Don't bet on it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, slow down there, whirlwind. - I'm not going home. You can't make me. - I know, I know. Easy. I just wanna talk. So, um, how you doin' out here? It's great, Dad. The junkyard dogs have taught me all the tricks. I go wherever I want, do whatever I please. No chains, no fences-- No regard for someone else's lunch? That's how it is out here on the streets. But then, you know all about that, don't you? You make the rules, Dad, but you didn't have to follow them when you were my age. Is that why you didn't tell me you were a street dog? I didn't want that life for you because I found something better. - I found love. - Oh, aw, ain't that beautiful? I think I’m gettin' all misty-eyed here. - I see you haven't changed a bit. - So here we are again. just like old times... before you turned your back on everything... that makes a dog a dog. - He says you walked out on him. - After I met your mother. .. I-l guess Buster just got jealous. - You ditched me! - I feel in love ! You made your choice! Now it's his turn to choose. - Come on, kid. - You don't know what he's really like, son. - You're coming home. - You hear that, kid? Daddy's telling you what to do again. - You don't belong here. - And he's leading you back to a life on the chain. - I'm offerin' you freedom. - Scamp. - Scamp. - Scamp. - Scamp! - Make your choice, kid. - He doesn't have a choice! I know what's best for him! No! You know what's best for you! Well, I’m not you, Dad! I'm a junkyard dog! That's my boy. I guess there are some things you have to learn on your own. When you've had enough, our door is always open. House dog to the end. What'd I tell you, kid? You can't teach an old dog new tricks. Huh? Hey, Scampski! This is for all you've done, kid. You did it, kid! You're at the top of the heap now ! A junkyard dog! I'm-- I'm a junkyard dog. - You made it to the pack! Ha! - You're a doll, doll face. I'm a junkyard dog! - How could you do that? - Come on, Angel. He's your father. Go after him. You're not like the rest of us. You're good and decent, kind. The streets will beat that out of you if you stay. But I made it. This is everything that I've ever dreamed of. Dreamed of what? This? You have a home and a family that loves you. - You're not like the rest of us, Scamp. - Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. Let's see. Uh, uh, he's good and decent and kind. Is that it, Scampy? -You want to be a ''widdle'' house doggie? -No! 'Cause you know how I feel about house dogs. Hey, cut it out! She's the one who wants to be a house dog, not me! - No! I didn't mean that. - Is that true, Angel baby? - I don't think a family's so bad. - You hear that, boys? She wants to be a little house pet. -Oh, she wants to be a little house pet. -Gonna wear ribbons. Gonna wear ribbons. - You ain't no junkyard dog. - That's right, Buster. I'm not. Not any more. Oh, and, uh, I’m not your girl. Oh, there's going to be trouble. May be you do belong here. - Oh, come on.Where is your sense of humour? - Come on. We were just--We were goofin'! Come on, Angel! Aw, who needs her? Let her go find some snivelling, little family. That's where she belongs. Angel. Angel? Angel! Angel? I didn't mean it, Angel. I don't know what I was thinking. Really. Angel, where are you? just as I suspected, out looking for Angel. Beautiful. Time to settle an old score. Hold it right there, ya scoundrel. What the-- Well, I'll be. You're not gettin' away this time. Great. I got everything I ever wanted, and it stinks. Come here, you little hooligan! Huh? Buster! Gotcha. Well, lookee here. No collar. It's a one-way trip to the pound for you. Oh, man, slick move-- me without a collar. How could I be so stupid? Dad was right. Buster's nothing but trouble. I wish I was home. Always there To warm you in the winter Always there With shelter from the rain Always there to catch you When you're falling Always there To stand you up again Family By your side In seconds if you ask it Arms out wide To welcome you to stay Near enough To listen to your heart's song Always there to help you On your way Family Family Family What is a family Caring and devoted hearts With endless love to share Love that will follow you Everywhere Always there - To welcome you in winter - What is a family Arms out wide - To welcome you to stay - Right by your side Near enough To listen to your heart's song Always there to help you on your way - Family - Always there - Family - Family Family - Scamp? - Angel! - Scamp! - Get outta here !

Long time no see, huh? Oh, I found you! You gotta come! Hurry! Scamp's in trouble! - Scamp. Uhh! - He's in the pound. Hold on, son! Keep your paws off my boy ! Hey, paws off my pop! Oh, yeah, he's cashed in his bones. He's cashed. Dad? Dad, you did it! Slick move ! All right. We have to go now. Aha! You! The one that got away. Let go! Let go! Oh, no! Oh, have mercy ! Ah, ha!

After I stood by you Se all through that fight? Hey, come back here ! What, are you walking away from me? - Pop? - Son. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have run away. Whirlwind. May be I was also being a little too tough on you. I don't see any harm in the two of us goin' down to the river... once in a while to bay at the moon. - What do you say? - Really? You and me? Your old man's still got a few good how is left in him. I found him. Oh. Oh, I found him for sure this time! - I found him! - Och, you found nothing! Again! - So far, you've found six cats, three gophers, two rats-- - Aw, go easy on him, Uncle jock. No, I'll not go easy on him, Scamp! Five flyin' pigs, a wildebeest-- Och! Scamp? Why, it is Scamp. Aye. I'll never hear the end of this one either. - Ready to go home, whirlwind? - Not quite, Pop. There's one last thing I got to take care of. Do mine eyes deceive me? Hey, Scamp! Scamp a doodle! You escaped the pound! Yeah, no thanks to you. Hey, come on. You know our motto. You can keep your motto... but not this. I'm going home where I belong. So long, Buster.

The garbage adds some class. Hey. Hey, someone wanna lend me a paw here? I think a home sounds nice. With lots of children and hugs and kisses. If you dogs leave, you're never comin' back. Au revoir, Buster. It has been, as you say, ''beautiful.'' Dogs! You can't leave me here ! I was only kidding. Buster's trouble ain't Buster's trouble. Come on! Buster's trouble is everybody's trouble. What's all the commotion? - Scamp? - Hey, Scamp! Scamp come home! - He's back! Hey, Scamp, I love you! Good job, boy. Oh, Scamp. It's so good to have you back where you belong. Ew. You reek! You need a bath. But we'll worry about that later. Jim, dear, I think Scamp brought a friend home. Hey there, girl. Come on.
