Subtitle by Aldi Arman You do not trust me. Danilo, please believe me. I am not stupid, Stella. Don't you dare fool me. You're very suspicious. I give you everything... - and this is what I get in return... - I'm sick and tired of your abuse... Danilo! Danilo, I' m sorry. Sorry. Cousin, Iet me help you with that. Kylie, I' m fine. Sure? Kylie, turn the pressure cooker off. - It's done. - Okay! The pork blood stew smells delicious! Wasn't this Danilo's favorite? Yes, that's right. Pork blood stew. Does Anton also Iike it? Trina, Danilo is not Iike Anton. Okay. Isn't Chef's salad your favorite? Lorna, I will not eat dinner here. Cheers! Lighter... Iighter. - Lorna... - There! - No. - Anton, sit down, please? - PIease? PIease? - Lorna. Okay, okay. Lorna, thank you for the dinner... but I came here to tell you that I' m getting married. Come on, didn't we already talk about this? Soup... soup... oh my God! The soup! Lorna. Lorna, I hope you understand that I' m in Iove with someone else. I hope you learn to accept it. Lorna! Lorna! What happened? Don't worry, I' m not hurt. And so is the baby. Marvin! Eat your food now! Go! Kids are tiring. Your fianc?'s taking too Iong. That's a negative in my book. - What do you Iike? - Maybe he's stuck in traffic. They delivered a vehicle in Laguna. Delivered? Anton is a Iuxury car dealer. He sold me my car. And did you know Anton and Stella met again because of my wife? Is that so? Your wife Kylie played matchmaker. - Danilo may not Iike that. - Shut up, Trina. I was just joking. Anyway, I want to throw a party for Fred... because of his promotion to Vice Presidency. Stella, I want your catering services... but I want better than this carinderia food. Oh, babe. No problem. Congratulations, Fred. Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening! Mom, where's Uncle Anton? He' II be here soon. Why don't you eat first? I want to wait for him. - Marvin, Iet's play. - Go play with him. - AII right! - He has not eaten yet. Let them play. They seldom get together anyway. - Go! - Where is Anton? I wasn't born to wait. - He's here. - Paolo! - Uncle Anton! - Uncle Anton... - Excuse me. - Uncle Anton! - Marvin also came. - Let' s play! - Is that a new car? - He seems okay. He's a good man. We know him. - Trina, please shut up. - He's here. Hi, guys! - Let's eat. - Sorry, I' m Iate. PIease be careful not to break anything. In fairness, Paolo Iikes him and he Iooks Iike a VP. - Fred! - Thank you. Do you know what car suits an executive Iike you? What? A sports car. A Benz or a BM with two doors. - Two doors? - It's very classy. It sure is, isn't it? But when we become a family we' II need one with four doors. Fred, buy now so Anton can earn from commission. But for you, I will waive my commission. I' II think about it. Don't do that, Anton. The wedding is soon. I wouldn't want my cousin to shoulder all the expenses. It's January. You still have time to save until the wedding in April. I have some money saved up for the wedding. Do you believe in what Trina said? That? That Danilo may not Iike what I did? Your ex-husband was a violent man. Especially when he got jealous. Possessive too. He seemed possessed when mad. What if he carried that trait on to the next Iife... Sorry, sorry. Let me. Don't pick up the shards, you might wound yourself. I' II get the broom. How do you know Anton? I' m Anton's fianc?e. Whoever you are, Ieave Anton alone. Stella. What's the matter? Nothing. You Ieft this. Your Iove story never fails to delight me. Imagine, your Iove traces back to your college days. Who would have thought you'd meet again after all the years you were apart? And I owe it all to you. If not for you, I would never have found Anton again. That's right. - And you will be getting married. - Again. But now, she's marrying the man she truly Ioves. If her parents didn't force her to Ieave Anton and marry Danilo... I' m sure she would have ended with Anton anyway. Her parents had good reason. They didn't think he could be a good provider. He's hardworking and smart. I' m sure he' II be a good provider to Stella and their family. Is that so? Why did he almost throw his Iife away? Because I Ieft him. This time around, I' II make sure he's never going to Iose me. - Mommy! Mommy! - Paolo! Paolo! Please don't, Danilo! Paolo! Paolo! Mommy! Mommy! - Paolo! - Mom. - Grandma! - Thank you. - Paolo. - Wow! - Grandma! - You look handsome! Is that what you're wearing to the wedding? - Greet grandma. - BIess me. My soon-to-be grandson Iooks handsome! Is that true, grandma? If you were my true grandson, I would say you took after your grandpa. Aunt. Mom, we' re getting married soon so Paolo will become a true grandson. And you will become my true dad, Uncle? Of course. You can already call me Daddy if you want. Yes, Daddy! After the wedding I want you to Iive with me. I get Ionely there. Anton rarely visits me. Mom, can't you move in with us instead? It can't be. I can't just abandon your father's house. They Iook Iike the real thing, don't you think? I will admit, I wasn't happy when the two of you got back together. Stella, I know we started on the wrong foot. Anton changed for the better because of you. I apologize. I may be a bitch sometimes but I' m also soft-hearted. Aunt, are you okay? Nauseated? I' m fine. I'm sorry, Danilo. I married you but it was Anton I truly loved. Please forgive me. Paolo and I have to move on. Anton, I've been having dreams about Danilo. I still feel guilty. When we met again at Kylie's birthday dinner... Danilo had been dead for four years. We' re not doing anything wrong. Stella, we' re getting married soon. I hope you think only of me. How about you? Do you think only of me? Of course. But when we were apart, surely you had other girlfriends. I was broken hearts. Heartbroken, you mean. Anton, is there someone who still bothers you, or calls you? Stella, I' m not keeping any secret from you. I will admit, when we broke up, I had many girlfriends. But when we met again, I Ieft all of them. We are gathered together to witness Anton and Stella profess their love... for each other in front of this community... this church, and our God Almighty. Christ, who baptized you in the Christian faith... now binds you together in this holy sacrament of... - Grandma? -...matrimony, without... - Stay here. -...doubts... of your own freewill, and in honesty. Let us pray. Almighty Father, have mercy on Anton and Stella... and grant their wish to have a blessed union of love. Grant them happiness, and all their children and loved ones... through your son, Jesus Christ, one with the Holy Spirit... - forever and ever. - Amen. By the power vested in me by God and the Catholic Church... Grandma? ...I now pronounce you, Anton and Stella... - Grandma? -...husband and wife. You may now kiss your wife. Grandma! Grandma! Mommy! Grandma! - Paolo?! - Paolo? - Paolo! - Grandma! Grandma! - Paolo? - Paolo? Paolo? - Mom! Anton! - Mom! - What happened? - Miss Milagros! Call an ambulance! - Marvin, you stay with your mom. - It disapproves! It disapproves! Let's move! - Let's go! - Get the car! Aren't you going to bring the furniture with you? No. I sold the house fully furnished. Anton's house is well-furnished anyway. I bet you' re getting a Iot from selling this. Danilo and I didn't finish paying for this house. I just got back what we invested. Stella, do you really have to do this? It's not practical to maintain two houses. Mom needs us there. If we had spare money... we can use it for more important things. Does Anton pay for his mother's medical needs? Kylie, my husband earns enough. Do you really need to bring this with you? We' re here, Paolo. Stella, this is our new home. What do you think, Paolo? I' m sure you' II Iike it here. Really, dad? But why didn't you Iike it here then? Because your grandma was difficult. But she's changed. Anton, don't say that. I was just joking. - Miss OIga. - Come in. Stella. Miss OIga, this is Stella, my wife. - She takes care of mom. - Good afternoon. She goes home at night because she Iives nearby. As Miss Vi said in the movie "Relasyon"... - I will ask for one simple thing... - Mom, we' re here. - How have you been? -...if you cannot respect me... as a househelp, respect me as a friend. If you still can't, then respect me as a human being. I' II be back, mom. Miss OIga is a huge fan of Filipino movies. Paolo, have you greeted your grandma? Hi, grandma. Miss Olga, kindly help us unload the rest of our stuff. Excuse me. Really now? Paolo, Iet's save that for Iater. Mom, you have to eat. PIease. Mom, bless me. Mom, eat this while it's hot. You need to eat. You liked it? Mommy! Paolo! - Mommy! - What are you doing in here? Mommy, I saw a shadow! - What shadow? - A huge one! It went into the cabinet! When I Iooked in, I was Iocked inside! Paolo, Iook, the cabinet doesn't have a Iock. But... You just imagined the shadow. Don't run around. You might hurt yourself. Mommy, are we really Iiving here? Son, this is our home now. Next to the home of the dead? Oh, my God... Don't worry. The dead will not disturb you. They do not have a reason to... visit you. Unless you' re Iike a carinderia, open to everybody who wants to eat. I would like to ask you something. Whatever your beliefs are... please keep it to yourself and don't tell my son. It scares him. I don't mean to scare. I' m just saying the truth. I don't want to believe my son's claim. So please... Are you sure it's only your son you wouldn't want to believe? Isn't it you? Stella, I know, you see things. You have to act on it now. I don't see anything. If you will not act, who will? If not now, when? Anton, I' II do that. I' II do this. I' II have it washed. Stella, I' m sorry. For what? Do you regret marrying me? Of course not! The money you Ient me for mom's expenses... I will pay you back every cent. Stella, I Iove you very much. I' II make it up to you, I promise. Anton, don't say that. We' re married. We should help each other. I appreciate it. Stella, this will pass. PIease don't think I' m going back to my old ways. Of course not. Whatever happens, I will never Ieave you. Fire! Fire! Fire! Mommy, Iook at what I found! - Paolo, that may belong to someone. - I' II be back, mom. Hey, Paolo, you found my favorite childhood toy! - Where did you see it? - Daddy, can I have it? Of course! But I think it's no Ionger working. Let's clean it up. Daddy, my RC is busted. Maybe it just needs new batteries. Let's Iook at it. Paolo, that robot and I were inseparable. Eat now. Would you Iike to go to the plaza? Only us two? What do you think? Shall we go with daddy? Paolo, when school opens, you will study here. You will meet many new friends. It reeks! It's your grandma! Paolo! It really smells! Be careful. Aunt! I apologize. Aunt, it's almost time... for the visitors. It's midnight, aunt. Do you see them? What are they doing? Leave them be. But what are they up to? Miss Olga's one eye, the bad one, sees ghosts. A visitor! But it's the first time I've seen it. Here I come... Paolo, you' re still awake, get up and go to sleep. Later, I' m still playing. We' re still playing, aren't we? Paolo, it's midnight... I don't want you staying up Iate, follow me now. I said later, you nag! What did you say? - Paolo, why did you say that? - I didn't say anything. Paolo, I told you to sleep and you must obey. - Give me that. - It's mine! Let go, Iet go! Mommy! I' m not holding it. Let's go to sleep. I thought correct. It's you the visitor is after. Stella... Stella... Stella? Stella! Stella! - " You'll regret this." - Stella, what's going on in there? Open this door! Stella! Stella, what? Stella! Stella! Stella! Congratulations! Your wife is ten weeks pregnant. Doc, could it mean that the hallucinations I experience... are because of my pregnancy? It's a possibility. You can develop hypertensive disorder. The increase in blood pressure can cause hallucinations. Have regular check-up. Avoid stress. It's bad for you and the baby. Paolo, you' re going to have a sibling soon. Will you promise me and your mom that you' II take care of him? Of course! Baby, hurry out so I can already take care of you. Stella, thank you. For what? You made me happy. Anton? Stella! It's hot in here. Let's go down. It's cooler there. Snacks are ready! Wow, did you prepare this? I wanted to surprise you. This is to celebrate our new baby on the way. And for the job offered by my uncle in Canada. May this good streak continue. I' m sure it will. I' II do everything for you. And for Paolo. And for our new baby. Mommy, eat it already. I helped daddy with that. - Really? - Yes! Cheers! I care about my job, ma'am. I care about you. Is it because of your pregnancy... that... there's a visitor? Miss OIga, it is indeed because of this pregnancy... that I imagine seeing things. I know that you know what you really see. Our third eye is awakened when we have near death experience. But you refuse to see what it sees. Miss OIga. Stella, the visitor after you is not good. It came back, for revenge. It becomes stronger as days pass. Do you want someone harmed before you believe? Stella, take good care. It can play tricks on you. Stella, one of our cousins arrived from Japan. - Do you remember Agnes? - Of course. We' II be throwing her a welcome party... and we want you to do the catering so you' II have money. Stella, what is this box? Pictures. Baby pictures of Paolo. With his dad. I' m sorry. This is all for Paolo. I cannot just Ieave it in the old house. I understand. He's his father no matter what. But I hope you get rid of the things that remind you of him. Miss OIga, my husband visited me Iast night. The bed moved and I was the only one in the room. He visited you indeed. I saw him last night leaving the cemetery. - Did you get to ask why he visited me? - Doray, it is you he wanted to talk to. - But only the bed moved. - That was a sign. That? Don't you remember anything he said or asked you to do you before he died? Nothing. Well you thought wrong, because there is, there is, there is! I' II go ahead, Miss OIga! Anton. That hurts! Stella! Stella, what's wrong? Who's stronger of you? Anton, please believe me, I didn't put the picture frames there. I believe you. It must really be Danilo's ghost who did that. Son, I' II go now! Daddy! I' II be right back, grandma! Daddy! Paolo, we' II go to the plaza some other time. I need to go to work. I have Iots to do. AII right, daddy. - Grandma! - Mom! - Grandma! - Mom! What happened? Miss OIga! Paolo, remember that your grandma's wheelchair is not a toy. It wasn't me. Mom. If Miss OIga is not around, watch over grandma, okay? Yes. Subtitle by Aldi Arman Hurry up, Doray. Serve me first, I' m starved. Marietta? - Yes. - So you work here. I'd Iike to apologize if sometimes I tell off Miss OIga. I know she's your aunt. I understand. But I hope you also understand her. Since her child died, she began seeing things. She Iost a child? He was very sick. That's why Miss OIga tried to take her Iife... so she could be with Gabriel but when she was saved from it... since then, she started seeing ghosts. Sadly, she has not seen the ghost of Gabriel. Marietta, do you believe her? - I do. - But why? I once Ioved a man. But I never got to tell him so when he died... I've been waiting for him to visit me. Depression is bad for the baby. I' m sorry. Are we good? I' II be gone for two days. I will miss you. I will miss you too. - Have a safe trip to Isabela. - Are you really going to Agnes' party? AIabang is far from here. I promised them. And it's been a while since I Iast saw Agnes. I asked Miss OIga to sleep here so you' II have company. Take care of our baby, all right? Baby, I will miss you and mommy. I'm impressed. You were able to deliver on such short notice. And the food is great! I agree, cousin. And I really can't stop eating if you cooked. Thank you. This helps because we need additional money... for the baby's delivery. Doesn't your husband have enough? He has. But I would also Iike to have some saved on my own. Food is okay? Good. Cousin, your food is a hit, Iook! Kylie, excuse me. Stella, cousin, thank you so much... you are so wonderful and the food is just... Stella? Stella? - What? - Are you okay? Okay, I' II just to say " hi" to the other guests, okay? Stella! I am haunted by Danilo's ghost. That may just be caused by your hypertensive disorder. You shouldn't have agreed to do this party. Kylie, this is the first time I' II tell you this. After the accident with Danilo, I've been seeing things. But I try my best to ignore it. After a year, Danilo stopped haunting me. But when Anton and I decided to get married... the haunting returned. After our wedding, Danilo became more violent. Do you believe me now? I knew something was going to happen because it was following you! Unless you believe, it will become stronger. You will not see because you refuse to believe. But you cannot prevent it if the ghost is bound to you. How do I get rid of it? You have to get rid of anything it may be bound to. Something it valued when it was still alive. As long as it's still intact, the ghost will remain on earth. Paolo! Paolo! Paolo! Boo!!! Marvin! - Surprise! - It' s good that you dropped by. My God, how can you stay in this dump? It's no wonder you seem to be Iosing your head. I would too. Nice view. I wanted to surprise you before I spend the day at the spa. She insisted to tag along. Kylie said you transferred to an exclusive subdivision. I didn't expect it to be this exclusive. Anton and I have plans to move to Manila. We're still looking. But I' m sure you understand... we cannot just Ieave his mother with her condition. Unthinkable. He used all your money, and now he made you a caregiver. He may not be a wife-beater but he is a user. I don't get it why you Iet him do this to you. Thanks for the visit. Marvin, say goodbye. We' re Ieaving. - Bye, Marvin. - Careful. Bye, Paolo. - Bye, Marvin. - Bye, Paolo. - Bye! - You' re such a slow poke. Mommy, why are you sad? Paolo, I' m not sad. What's wrong, mommy? You' re too old to cry. Why can't you just accept that her Iife is pitiful with Anton? But did you have to rub it in? Well, I' m sorry but I' m just trying to put some sense into her. Instead of hurting her feelings, you could have encouraged her. By saying that it's all right? That her husband is okay? You are the culprit. You had them meet again. Trina, we both know... that they Ioved each other even before Stella married Danilo. And one more thing, it's about time for Stella to move on and be happy. Miss? Miss! Let me out! Miss! Help me! I will be late. Why? We have to deliver a car to Laguna. AII right. Take care, Anton. Okay, bye. Bye. Kylie? Kylie? Stella, Stella. Kylie! Hello? - Stella? Stella? Kylie is dead! - What? No! You' re Iying! That's not true! The visitor killed Kylie. Trina said it was an accident. You don't believe me? Miss OIga, I did everything you told me to do. But why doesn't he Ieave me alone? Are you sure you destroyed everything he may be bound to? Yes! It's the only way to drive the ghost away! Unless... Unless what? Unless he's here not because he's still bound. What if, he's here for you? What if he couldn't Ieave you? Stella? She experienced mild contractions but she's fine now. Doc, how's the baby? I' II advise you to closely watch over the baby. I'll go ahead. Mom, I' II be right back. Miss OIga, please Iet us know when you' re in the house. How often? Once? Twice? Three times? More? How often? Miss OIga, did you want to tell me something? Stella, I now know how to drive the visitor away. How? If it is able to exact revenge on the person who killed him... he' II Ieave. Nobody killed Danilo. It was an accident. Are you sure? Yes, I was with him in the car. We were arguing before we crashed onto a wall. That killed him. Is that what he came back for? I don't know, I' m not sure. This is the Iatest model, Sir, but it is a Iimited edition of Benz. If you need anything from me, just call me anytime. Okay. - Thank you, Sir! - Thank you too. Thank you! Stella, why are you still up? Anton, I' m haunted by a ghost. Don't tell me you Iet Miss OIga get to you. Anton, Danilo is back for me. Is it really that difficult for you to forget him? - Anton, please believe me. - Enough. I think it was Danilo who caused your Mom's stroke. It was Danilo who killed Kylie and now he wants to kill our baby. I said enough! It's sweet of you, mommy, to bring daddy food. Excuse me, he's still talking to someone. He's there. This smells delicious! This was a surprise. I think I was the one surprised. What do you mean? Am I the only woman in your Iife? Am I the only one you got pregnant? Anton, before we got married... I asked you if you kept anything from me. When did you plan to tell me the truth? Stella. We talked about this. I told you before we got married, I ended all my other relationships. Believe me. Believe you? Or should I just have believed Trina when she told me you were only using me. You hit that right now. Am I next? Paolo, Iet's go. Ah! - Ah! Milagros! - Miss OIga! Milagros? - Mom! - Milagros! - Mom! - Don't! Don't! Anton? Why didn't you watch over my mother? - Anton, it's not my fault. - Anton, Stella, wait up. You have to know something about Milagros's death. It's a woman, Stella. A woman is visiting you. Enough of this! Anton, why don't you Iet Miss OIga explain? I said enough! Don't you have better things to do? If not for your bullcrap, my mother would still be alive! Leave now! Gabriel? My son. We' II soon be together... I love you so much, my son. I Iove you so much. My son, we' II be together now. Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! Aunt, don't move, I' II call for help. Let me be, I want to be with my son. Help Stella. Have pity on her. Aunt! Dearest Anton, I love you so much. Thanks for loving me. I wish this is forever. Especially now that we're having a baby. Love, Lorna Anton! Anton, answer me! If you will not go back here, I will kill myself! - How are you related to Anton? - Who's this? I'm Anton's fianc?e. - And who are you? - I'm Lorna! I'm his girlfriend! I need to talk to Anton. Whoever you are, leave Anton alone. I will kill myself, I will kill myself, I will kill myself! What are you doing here? It's Anton and Stella's wedding, don't make a scene here! I'm pregnant. He should marry me. I will not allow it because you're a psycho! Leave now! Milagros! You will regret this. Miss Stella! Miss Stella! I will kill everybody who got in the way of our love! Miss Stella! Miss Stella! Miss Stella! - Miss Stella, aunt OIga is gone. - What? But before she died, she told me to go here and help you. Help me? Here it is, Miss Stella. Everything to help drive away the visitor is written in that book. It says there that... the body of the dead who visits you must be blessed by a priest... so it can rest in peace. - Anton! - Stella! Stella, I Iove you so much. Stella, I have to tell you something. Listen to me. Anton, it is Lorna. It's Lorna who visits me. Her body must be blessed so she can finally rest in peace. No, Stella, Stella. Get Paolo and Ieave the house now! Move now! I' II take care of it. Anton, please take care. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Paolo! Paolo, my son! Paolo! If you leave me, I will get back at everybody who caused it. Your mother who never thought I was good enough for you. That bitch Kylie who led you back to Stella. And Stella. Stella, Stella! - Stella who stole you from me! - Lorna, stop it now! She stole you from me, she stole you from me! Lorna, I said stop it! You didn't think I know all of this? When you love someone, you have to know everything about him. Leave them out of this! They're not at fault. It was I who wanted to leave you. We talked about this, don't you get it? No matter what you do, it will not bring back my love for you. Is that your decision? - I will kill myself. - Lorna, stop this! Go ahead, go ahead, do it! You can no longer stop me with that drama. Lorna, stop it! Lorna! Lorna, Lorna? Lorna, please forgive me. PIease Ieave Stella and the others out of this. Not them. My God... Paolo? Paolo! Paolo! Paolo is in there! My son! It's stuck! Paolo! - Help me, Marietta! - Miss Stella! Paolo! My son. Paolo? - My son... my son? - Mommy... Mommy, I' m glad you came. Mommy! Miss Stella! Father, will God still forgive me for everything I've done? My child, there is no sin too great for our Lord's pardon. Call unto Him, surrender yourself to Him. He alone can save us. Let's hurry! - Marietta, get Paolo. - Paolo, Iet's go. Hurry! Miss, miss, mommy... Mommy! - Mommy? Mommy... mommy! - Miss Stella! - Mommy! - Paolo! Paolo! Don't! - My son! - Miss Stella! Miss Stella! - Miss Stella! - Mommy... mommy! Paolo, Paolo, Iet's get help! - Paolo, Iet's go! - Mommy, I don't want to Ieave her here! My son! Paolo! No! My son... Father, help us. He will save us, I believe. - Anton? - We' re almost there, Father. The Lord will not forsake us. Just hold on to Him. Lorna, haven't you had enough? PIease stop! You need to destroy everything it may be bound to. Have mercy on us, oh, Lord! We offer You your child who passed on. May she be spared from punishment... for all her wrongdoings caused by her selfishness. May her true faith bind her to the angels in heaven... and to You through your mercy... No! No! Not my baby! In Jesus' name, our Savior. Lord, help us... We believe You alone can save us from any harm. Save us, oh Lord! Lord, Lord, save us! Have mercy on her soul! Anton, it's done. She' II no Ionger bother us. She's gone. It's over. Stella, forgive me... I Iove you so much. I Iove you so much too, Anton. Anton! Anton... Lord, in your hands I offer the soul of Anton. May You gladly welcome him into Your kingdom in heaven. Mommy! Mommy... mommy. You' re safe now, my son. You' re safe now. Marietta, thank you very much for helping sell the house. Don't mention it. How have you been? We' re getting by, I have to be strong for my two children. Marietta, we' II go ahead. AII right, take care. Bye, Paolo. Bye, baby Anton. Bye, Miss! Bye! Subtitle by Aldi Arman
