[Instrumental "Deck the Halls"] ♪ This is one of my favourite pieces from the collection. Her use of texture creates movement, and it makes it feel like this piece is alive, like it's breathing. Abstract impressionists use acrylic to create emotion through colour and space. It just creates this emotional response... [sighs] ...that is absolutely unrivalled. Nobody does it like Blake Walker. But I can go on and on, and on. Please peruse, take your time, but if you have any questions, please find me. [sighs] Rebecca, that was perfect. Always working your magic. No one sells my pieces like you do. Thank you. Oh, by the way. Did you get the email proposal that I sent you about the outreach program for the gallery? Hmm, yes, uh, the kid thing? -Yeah. -Where we do stuff for free? You know, it's just not the right time for that. We're so busy before Christmas. Let's take a look at it in the new year, okay? Mmmhmm. Now let's go sell some paintings. My art is the perfect holiday gift for their loved ones because... Because it's the only investment that's both emotional and practical. Okay, okay. Go, go. [phone buzzes] Hey, sis. What's going on? You getting ready for your big trip? Yeah, about that... I have some bad news. Wait, what's going on? You're leaving for Africa tomorrow, right? Courtney: Yes well, you know how mom was supposed to watch the kids? Yeah? Honey, it's Mom. I know you're working, but we wouldn't bother you if it wasn't an emergency. What's going on? Well, I might've broken my leg. Mom! You broke your leg? How? She fell off a ladder putting Christmas lights up. Rebecca: Okay, Mom, are you okay? I'm just fine, I promise. Mom, what did we tell you about doing dangerous things alone? Girls, it's just a fracture. But that's not the real problem. Courtney: Mom can't really take care of the kids anymore while we're on our trip. Pam: I can't drive. The doctor told me that I had to take it easy, no walking or moving around for a while. Courtney: So we were thinking that maybe you could come and maybe take care of the kids instead. Okay, wait. Time out. You want me to come and take care of Maggie and Dan for two weeks? Well, I'll be here to help. It's just that I can't drive them to school or to practice, or make dinner. I don't know. It would mean so much to me and Jim, and the kids would be so happy to have you here. You know, it would be nice to get there before Christmas Eve, and be able to do fun things like carolling, and making homemade ornaments, and oh, I could even take the kids to do stuff with Santa. Are they still even into that? They would love it. I don't know, it's just such a busy time here at work. Rebecca: I don't know if I can get away for two weeks. Please try. We've been planning this trip for years. If you can't come, we are going to lose our deposit. [sighs] Who plans a trip during Christmas, anyway? It was the only time Jim and I could get off work together. And besides, we'll be back before Christmas, so it's not that big of a deal. Um, yes it is. It's Christmas. So you'll do it? Please. [sighs] I'm going to try. Um, Blake. I'm so sorry to interrupt, but can I have a moment? I have a little bit of a family emergency. My mom broke her leg. Oh, how terrible. I know. And my sister and brother-in-law are headed to Africa in the morning, so they need me to watch the kids. Oh. I know, I know. My mom was supposed to watch them. However, now I have to watch all of them. I have to go to Nashville for two weeks. Two weeks? This is our busiest time of year. Don't worry.

You must of course take care of your family. But I expect you to be working. Lots of shipments to manage. Don't worry, I will be on top of it.

I just feel so stupid. Oh, you're not. You're just hurt. And if he's saying he's sorry, you should believe him. It's Drew. That kind of love and trust from your friendship just never goes away.

We were. Well, you know Becca as well as I do. She loves the chaos of the hustle and bustle, but is terrified of change. Yeah, that's Bec. Well, you know, if there were other feelings involved, more than feelings of just friendship, I think that would make a lot of sense.
