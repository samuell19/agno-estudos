Air France Flight 632, destination Rome, departing... This way, sir. We have taken care that nobody will disturb him. We were very worried. Your brother has been very ill. Very ill indeed. There he is. We'll wait for him downstairs at the exit from Customs. Your uncle has always been highly original. My uncle is first and foremost your brother. That's why he's an original. Otherwise, I'd have called him a bastard. Air France Flight 632, destination Rome... Doctor, there's no saving me. I stink of death. The scavengers have had a whiff and they've come to attend the feast. The family are putting on a fine front, looking like assholes as always, but with fresh complexions. Their virtue preserves them. Glad to welcome you. - Bah! How are you bearing up? I'm not. These others had to carry me. I'm going to die. Oh, come on! This is my nephew, Simon. Ah... - Alphonsine's son. A nice addition. A comedian, by the looks of it! I'm going to die surrounded by hilarious cherubs. Don't excite yourself. Tell me... Is he delirious? No. Are you a relative? Yes. His brother François Larmentiel, CEO of the Larmentiel company. Open the big gate and show the ambulance in. Claude! Your uncle's here. Who's this? - Lucien Beauvoisin. Louise's husband. Louise is married? Ah, poor chap! This way. Hello, uncle. My daughter, Claude. Dear little niece, you have permission to gaze upon your uncle from Tahiti. The fabled being. They must have told you about me. I must have featured in your childhood dreams. She looks like mummy. And she smiles... She thinks it was a compliment. Decidedly, in this family, the women all have this blonde smile and this diaphanous stupidity found nowhere but in Botticelli! Come on, hup! So I have to see no more of this! Pay no heed. The journey has tired him out. Come on, this way. We'll install him on the second floor. Why the second floor? Why not put me in the attic? My room is here. I recognise it. Facing south-east. I want to die in my own bed. Don't talk nonsense. We've given it to Claude. By what right? Bah! Were we supposed to assume... That I would make you happy by returning. You'll have to get used to it. Come on! About turn, to the right! Install me in my bedroom as a little boy. I didn't expect to die wrapped in organza. Your daughter has a tart's taste. Oh well... It's ridiculous, but it's mine. It's ours, if you will. Oh, if you like! I didn't say that I would keep this room. Even if it's what you want most, don't expect to be installed in the living room. You saving that for the catafalque? I can just imagine... The parade of the bigwigs, crowned by the flight crew, crowned by the servants, yours... What will you put on the ribbon? You always had a gift for snappy slogans. "To my beloved brother". I don't find that amusing at all. Snappy slogans aren't necessarily funny. Having said that, stop playing the condemned. It's depressing for everyone. According to the doctor, you had a heart attack, your condition is serious, but in no way alarming. Don't talk to me like I'm senile. My legs and kidneys may be passed it, but the bonce still functions. Let's take this opportunity to talk seriously. You left home 40 years ago. They kicked me out. - It's not for me to judge the reasons why father booted you out. You've returned here, it's your right. But may I ask why? To die in my brother's arms. I said: "seriously." I came back to piss you off. Mission accomplished. What's next? - That concerns the solicitor. Talking of which, I need a solicitor tomorrow morning, first thing. I'll ask Chave to drop by. You take me for a fool? I said a solicitor, I didn't say yours. A solicitor picked at random from the phonebook. As long as you don't know him, there's a chance he'll be honest. Mr. Lamasure asks to see you. Send him in. What are you waiting for? Lamasure. Good morning, solicitor. Thanks for coming so speedily. - It was the least I could do. I said something amusing? No. It's your appearance amuses me. You must certainly have expected to be greeted by my brother. You seem disappointed. - Not at all. Well, so much the better! Because my brother is in excellent health, and I'm dying. As you are a solicitor, this should suit you. Grab a chair and be seated. - Thank you. My dear sir, I've sent for you because I have the intention of lighting a firecracker up the ass of... Sister, would you be so kind as to step outside? But Mr. Larmentiel ordered me... - I warn you that I have already violated half a dozen novices. And several missionaries. And I could still distinguish myself. Now sod off out of it. In Tahiti, we hardly rape anyone. It attracts too many tourists. While I was in Oubangui, when I got there 20 years ago, they still did it. You heard of it? Of what? Oubangui, of course. What did you think? No, I don't know it. Ah, blimey... Now, what was I saying? You spoke of lighting a firecracker. - Oh yes. Dear sir, I was a 30 year old like any other. In those days, I hadn't travelled yet and I was doomed to find my distractions in my immediate surroundings. That's how my father's little employee, who was called Marceline and who looked after his estate, found herself pregnant with my works. My father fell stiff as a board. Yes, because with the Larmentiels there's a tradition of heart attacks when faced with an irritation. Yes, it's the loaded dice, the marked card you pull out of your sleeve to secure the big win. I think I've heard talk of it: the Larmentiel thrombosis. I'll admit I didn't believe it. Coming from such a respectable family, I encourage you, young man, to believe it all. Erm... What was I saying? You were 20 years old, a certain Marceline was pregnant, and Mr... Yes! Well, my father... My father remained stiff on the office carpet. Yes... He stayed there about ten minutes, time enough to reflect. One month later, I found myself in Trondheim, at an acquaintance of the family. Are you familiar with the Arctic Circle? No, I've not had that pleasure. Well, you've made a mistake! It's cheerful, it's invigorating. Naturally, I got the hell out as soon as I could. Perhaps I was wrong. Because ice preserves. The tropics, on the other hand, give you the choice between cirrhosis and the pox. I gave both the chance. That's the Larmentiel in me... Afraid of missing out on a deal. You must think I'm nuts. I'm a solicitor, not a doctor. I record, I advise, but I don't diagnose. Well then, my dear sir, make a good record of this. I charge you with finding the child I had 40 years ago. Boy or girl, I know not. It doesn't even matter. Good day, sister. Hello, François. Where have we got to? I've no idea. The solicitor is with him. I don't listen at doors. What information do you have? - Chave provided me some. Modest solicitor, small real estate business, pension funds, mortgage loans... Small beer, you know! We should be able to bring him to terms. Hm... Will I have the strength? Will I have the time? I beg you, not with me. Okay, let's talk. You know the affection I have for my brother. What? - Nothing. This is off to a good start, that's all. Absolutely none. ALL JAPAN ON ALERT FOR RADIOACTIVE ASH Not so fast. Marceline who? Bouet. She lived on Rue du Four, behind the arsenal. In her room, there was a kerosene stove. The water was on the landing. The child would have been born in March or April... 1920. This should be easy to verify. If this boy or girl is still alive and I find them, should I bring them here? Look at me, eh! You think I'm the sort of father to show to them, a display fit for a child? A child in their forties! Children sometimes retain a certain dignity. Adults have none. I can see them standing here, this love child. Two possibilities: they'll set me on fire, or they'll weep over me calling me "Daddy!", both of which prospects disgust me. EMILE'S BOAT Come on! Drop the buoy. Busting your ass 15 days for this... Hi, Léon. - Hi. Fernande around? - No. Some red? Later. You kidding me or what? You know what time it is? - Why? Because you have ten minutes to do the shopping, set the table and make chow. - I'd be busting my ass for nothing. Eh? My hair... I was thinking of a restaurant. You'd be mistaken. We've eaten three time already in restaurants. Well, enough of that! Say, you're a cheapskate. - I'm fragile. And Camille's cooking, no thanks! And the chef's is unspeakable. This is how it'll go... Go and buy two steaks and cook them. Hey! I'm not your maid, nor your wife. Change the record. That's the truth. You come home after 15 days, don't even kiss me. You don't even say hello. You might show some TLC before giving me a mouthful. All you think about is stuffing yourself. Right. How've you been? - Fine. Get up and move it. The butcher is about to close. If you're so keen on waltzes... - It's not. Well, it's going to be! Enough is enough! Come on, get up! I don't give a shit about your records and your polishing your nails. Ah, madame wants to go to the restaurant! I'll give you what for... your songs and your polishing your nails until noon! You might kiss me. Don't screw it up: two fillet steaks. And make sure you do it. Come on! Hey, you stuffed suit! Try the keyhole, you'll have a better view. You work for the Larmentiel company. That's to say: me. - I thought it'd be a good idea... I don't pay you to think. I pay you to perform. By the way, as for your deadline of the 30th, ask Mr. Mougin to sign your chèque. Since the two of you get along so well. We'll talk about it some more later. Mr. Lamasure, I believe? You wanted to see me? Indeed, sir. I understand that my being here surprises you. Somewhat. I know that my excellent colleague, Mr. Chave, usually takes care of your affairs. With what nonsense has my brother charged you? Well, it's this... I should obviously respect professional confidentiality, but I think this is too serious, that it may have repercussions so important that I think it's my duty... Well, to get to the point... You probably are unaware that 40 years ago, 39 to be exact, a certain Marceline Bouet... - Gave birth to a son, Émile Bouet, father unknown... Unknown? It's a turn of phrase. Because I know him. And so do you. I have indeed just found him. And guess where? - In La Rochelle. I could have, my dear sir, saved you a lot of legwork. Émile Bouet started as a cabin boy in the Larmentiel company. Aged 12. At least, in my father's time. He stayed with us until the day he decided to start fishing on his own account. We greatly regretted it. Regretted it, that horrible individual? He's the best fisherman on the coast. And we live by fishing. I don't suppose you came here for a lecture on trawling or on the life of the sardine. Therefore, I'm listening. Well? Very good... It's as bad as all that? Not bad, sir: catastrophic. I wouldn't have taken a step quite so unconventional as this if the Larmentiels weren't the most important in the city, as universally respected on the professional level as they are as a family. In short, an example to us all. These days, in our age, such examples are rare. They are extremely rare. Get to the point! Mr Charles-Edmond Larmentiel intends to give his entire fortune, that's to say the part that belongs to you, to Émile Bouet. Obviously, you're going to tell my brother the result of your research. Obviously. You will then formulate the will. It's obviously unthinkable that there should be some legal hitch that would render the will null and void. No... Of course not. You're a man who knows his business. You have already transgressed your conscience in coming here to alert me. I don't think I can ask any more of you. One may be a dynamic chap, full of energy, there are things one can do and things one can't. It's necessary, in short, to find a satisfactory solution. Mr Charles-Edmond Larmentiel is my client. You have many others? Some. Of course, I don't intend to compete with Mr. Chave. Why not? Chave was nothing until my father entrusted his affairs to him. He was for a long time, I must say, an excellent solicitor. He was? - He's 65 years old. I don't need to underscore that from now on... certain of your transactions will pass through the office of Mr. Lamasure. We understand well enough. Yes, you do. You're the more intelligent. But this elucidation is addressed to Lucien. Thank you. But let's get back to our oddball. If he bequeaths his shares, more than 33%, plus the right of succession to a stranger, whoever that may be, it's the end for the Larmentiel company. Couldn't we take steps before the will is registered? Something legal, needless to say. - What? When he is not under the effects of morphine, Charles-Edmond is prey to atrocious suffering. Yes. Relief in his final moments, increase the dose, show humanity... I see where this is going. I say no. What if we had him committed? Because it's obvious uncle Charles is crazy. Not sufficiently. - Now you're being difficult. Come in. Émile Bouet? Émile... Oh, I'm not saying that Émile is an ugly name, but in the end... She might have called him Charles-Edmond. We are never missed as much as we'd like to think. They love you, and the moment your back's turned... Hey! Where'd he go? Leaving aside the issue of his first name, I say again, Mr. Larmentiel, that this man called Bouet is a dangerous schizophrenic. Don't try to impress me with these fancy Latin terms. I went to high school. He gets drunk as soon as he lands. He lives with Fernande, an obscure singer but infamous prostitute, who, they say, was the star turn in a Nantes' dive, 'Le Mistigri'. [N.B. Meaning both "pussycat" and a card game] Really? You don't say! But this is wonderful! Excuse me? This child is flesh of my flesh. She's like me, only better! I must see her. I need you to bring her to me. You can't want this? - Oh yes, I want it! It's all I want from now on. That's it! I want this child here for lunch tomorrow. Come on, come on! I'm going to warn them. They all should know. You should see the look on their faces. Come on, young man! Think of the repercussions of a scandal. The scandal is that my child is forced to get drunk in a bistro rather than doing it with the family. But that's going to change. Alert my brother that he's about to be down in baccarat, and in grandmother's silverware. You don't think he's crazy? I want... You are children. They don't commit people because they cry out, especially the sick. Of course, if he displayed himself naked in the window or if he bit the nun... You catch my drift? I want to kill the fatted calf and not skimp on the feast. I'll tell them, but it's your responsibility. Yes, that it is. Wait, hey! Add one more place setting. I want the whore to be one of us. We'll have her sing at dessert. Good God, I'm not sorry I came. I've never had so much fun as just before dying. Well? He wants to see him. Worse, he has it in mind that they come here tomorrow. I'm really sorry. If those two lunatics meet, I leave it to your imagination. We can imagine it very well. But for your part, you can imagine too that perhaps Émile Bouet will have to go to sea for ten days. You'll just gain some time. Yes, but in this instance time being money, I'd like to gain as much as possible. Gentlemen, in the interests of a family that I respect, I'll try to gain you a week. Don't ask me for anything more. - Thank you. Gentlemen. See you soon. What are you planning to do? Firstly, Simon, you will send a courier tomorrow to Mr. Bouet telling him to drop by the office. There is in every family, I'm speaking of the most esteemed, a monkey in every closet. Ours is called Émile. It's essential, gentlemen, that we house-train ours. You say that Rheims is worthless? No, they're even artists. But football, it's in the head and the feet. You love thuggery. - Excuse me! Don't confuse thuggery and manly play. And I say "manly" advisedly. I could say something about that. So could I. Serve, it would be better. You think he'll ask him for the 17,000 bucks? - Who? Well, Émile! Who else? I can see it already. "Are you well, Mr. Larmentiel? My respects to your wife!" He's a widower, Larmentiel. It was a figure of speech. Everyone's a pussy when it comes to dealing with Larmentiel. With Émile, you never know. Émile's like all the rest. Like all the rest. Delightful. Let's hope he's sober. When I think... When you think what? Nothing. I'd rather hold my peace. My birthright, my education, all that to see come in one Émile Bouet. A Bouet who's on the way to becoming a Larmentiel. I'm an Larmentiel too. By my mother. 50% worth. I'm only worried about those at 33. Who is calling? - Émile Bouet. Mr. Larmentiel is waiting for you. Follow me please. Ah, my dear Bouet! Delighted. Delighted to see you. Mr. Larmentiel. Kind of you to interrupt your busy schedule. It's the least one could do. - Sit down, old man. I don't know if I should call you Emile or Bouet. I remember that my father called you Emile. He liked you. - You too. Huh? You too, you called me Émile. Ah, you see? I knew it. It'll make it easier to tell you what I have to say to you. Cigarette? No, thanks. I only smoke greys. - Ah! Well... By the way, take one. If they appeal... No, no... And then why not! You're right. A small one. It's easier on the throat. You must be like me, a heavy smoker. On land, yes... At sea we're too busy. Yes, I can imagine. You know, I've heard a great deal about you. I've even heard that you've broken the fishing records. Records don't mean much. It's usually a matter of luck. - Come on, come on! Don't be so modest. As it happens, your performances are of great interest to me. And you will come to see why. You have to moor next to the Ventou? Like everyone else. They all want to see that. It's good, eh? It's even great. I had planned, as I'm sure you know, to entrust the first fishing campaign to old Chotel. Your Master-at-Arms? He's good. Yes, he's very good. However he's decided to retire. I'm looking for someone to replace him. And I thought immediately of you. Of me? Yes, old pal. You were raised in this company. I've seen you at work. I know your abilities. I'm in my sixties. I'm still active, certainly... But things aren't what they were. Now, you know the importance of this business. Its canneries, its shipyards, its freezers, that's to say... Everything that our competitors call a trust, and that I call a pain in the ass. I have all this on my shoulders, 24/7. And all alone. Because my brothers-in-law work in hosiery or in the bank. As for my nephew's law degree, you know about them. Be aware that I'm very flattered, Mr. Larmentiel. But aren't you worried that this might be a bit much? Master-at-Arms is a big deal. 15 boats out fishing, that must be 1000 to 1500 quintals a week. Ah... at the moment, we're well short of that. I'm speaking of what it could be. I'm not joking. - I'm laughing though. Now I know I was right and that you are the man for the position. Already calculating the catch... Hey, have you seen the old man? He got up at 7am and I've heard nothing since. He had to go collect our dosh. - Yeah. If as I hope your answer is yes, we can discuss as soon as possible your regular salary and your bonuses. At the risk of sounding rude, I was just about to discuss money with you. Already? Yes, already. It's about something from 15 years ago. Just before I left you. A forgotten tugboat bonus of 17,000F. Wow! I'll admit that I hadn't remembered. Yes, but the guys remember it. Of course. Therefore, if I'm to have them on board, I need the accounts to be up-to-date. That's all. But I'd be happy to. I'll have to write you a money order. And at the same time, I'm going to set up an inquiry. Mr. Boissard, come to my office. I'd like to know who had the nerve to dispute a debt so incontestable as one from tugboat operations. I think it was you. Me? Boissard, don't bother. If you see my human waste disposal, tell him there are some stuffed clams waiting. That should help him get a wiggle on. This is the proof, my dear Émile, that when a man tries to manage everything himself, he is in danger of making the most serious errors. I know the stats better than the men. This is why we will complement each other wonderfully. I'll be your eyes and you'll be my ears. What a picture. Think about it carefully and give me your answer tomorrow morning. Thank you, miss. But in the meantime, be discreet. No need to stir up gossip that will be confirmed soon enough. You will come to know, my dear Émile, the pleasure of having enemies. Émile... It won't be long before only a few address you so. For the others, you'll be Mr. Bouet. A man to look up to. One of the city's celebrities. The man who started at 13 as a cabin boy with Larmentiel and who at 40 became a partner. Oh yes! A partner. A success story out of the ordinary. See you tomorrow. Here, 10.30. Understood. So, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Right... You, come here. Sometimes, you have to make things happen. Some let the grass grow under their feet and others are special success stories. Of course, a few take you by surprise. This is it. But if they're hard workers, it's less of a surprise. What are you wittering on about? - I know well enough. You're the lucky one. Lucky... Of course, some will call it lucky. I should keep quiet here! But... It could be something's about to happen. And sooner than you think. I know a few who are going to start understanding their misery. How funny it'll be! Not everyone will see the joke, but I couldn't give a shit. And that includes my associates Instead of talking to yourself, come and play. No. Tonight I'm going out with Fernande. Where are you going? Where? Why? To celebrate what? If anyone asks, say you don't know. Or that I don't care. Keep talking... You make me laugh! Give me a refill, that would be even better. Come on, the drinks are on me! Come on! Come on! Have a drink and don't ask any questions. Here, come on! This one is cheaper... - You coming? Come on! I can't decide. If it's the Trident you want, you have it. There! 30F... I've already told you that money is no object. You told me that once before, the day of the sweepstake. You'd blow it all by choosing in a rush. You think they're going to run out? That ended up with a pair of stockings and a new belt. This is nothing to compare. I've told you the situation and you give me earache? 15 boats, you hear me? 15! And all under my command! Some day, it'll come back to haunt you. - Why? Boozing like you do. Come on. And my frigidaire? Like I told you about Larmentiel... We're like this! Three hours we spent talking! You hear me? Three hours. I'm not deaf. - And we're partners. Partners! Yes! Ah, for pity's sake! There! The freezers, the canneries... He'll keep all that for himself. I'd be wasted with the paperwork. But this here! All this! Starting tomorrow, it's Émile's. Mr. Bouet. These 15 rust-buckets. Look... Those! Plus the Ventou which will be exclusively mine. Ha! Now that you can see it for yourself, do you believe me? It's the port of La Rochelle. I never said it didn't exist. Listen, Fernande. I'm trying hard, I'm explaining it to you, I'm keeping you informed, but you're going to wind up with a smack. In front of your future office, that'll look good! Yes, you're right. Besides, I have other projects. The thing is, us two, it can't carry on. I mean to say: carry on like this. Because, behind my back, they say I'm involved with a tart. Yes! - A tart? That's what they say? No, they insinuate! Let's talk instead about the blindness of love. No... who do you mean? Of a singer who sacrificed her career for a slob. Career... the 'Mistigri'. Let it drop... Come on, let's go. You've made me lose my thread. What was I saying? - That this can't go on much longer. What? - The two of us. That's it... We must get married. Yes. Previously, it didn't matter, we slept together and it was nobody's business. But now I'll be a celebrity. I might even go to mass and all that! Since we can't create gossip, and because deep down I love you, so let's get married. There you go! I've seen you blotto before but never like tonight. You don't believe me? - Well, no. And all this, you don't believe me either? Not in the slightest. Then you believe none of this? - Yes, that you're drunk. Right. Come with me. - Emile. Come with me! Two reds... You don't think you've had enough? If you understood better, I'd drink less. Explaining things to you 36 times, I'm drying out. Since you don't believe me, we'll call my partner. Here he goes again. Émile... Where's your telephone? - You're not going to do this! Oh, Émile! I'm not coming. Come on, I'm telling you. - No! This is ridiculous. - Come on. Excuse me. Telephone? -Telephone. You know the number? - Do I know it!? You're not going to do this! Come on. This is ridiculous! Madame's in for a surprise. Here. Here! Go on. Do I have to phone? - Go on. Call. - Okay, I'm calling. That's it, I'm calling. Bring us two halves. Landlord, a red! It's ringing. - Give me that. Hello? Hello. This is Mr. Bouet. I'd like to speak to Mr. Larmentiel. Stop. - Which one? Well, your boss! Like there was another one. What a jerk, these butlers! I must tell François to fire him. Hello? It's Émile. Good evening, Mr. Larmentiel. Forgive me for calling you at this hour, but I don't recall if it's tomorrow morning or tomorrow evening we're due to see each other. I forgot my appointment book. Tomorrow, at 10.30, my dear Émile. Right. Is it at your house or in the office? Well... in the office. Unless you'd rather... No, no. That's perfect. Perfect, perfect. Okay! So then see you tomorrow. And my apologies once again, Mr. Larmentiel. Good evening. Goodbye, Mr. Larmentiel. So, sourpuss... Hm? What do you have to say about that? Your mind seems elsewhere. Hm? Oh yes. While I think of it... One day this week, I'll be inviting Emile Bouet for dinner. I'd like you to be there. I don't see the point. My child, the men who, in your eyes, have some point generally turn out to lack one. For example, your cousin Simon. He's a man of great value. Hard-working, dynamic, and most importantly these days, a success by his own efforts. Success at what? Everything. He began with us as a cabin boy, and I intend to make him general manager of our fisheries. I even hope. to raise him much higher. Émile is a child of nature and I would like to create between him and us a familial relationship. I mean... that he finds with us the home he has always lacked. Your play. I'm counting on it. It's funny how the physical can be misleading. Émile may seem like a cheerful brute. However he's a lad of great delicacy. Goddam it, I'll rip your screen off if you don't open up! Hey! You crazy, or what? You want me to come down? Yes, that's what we want. - Sorry, sir. Do you have a 4-speed electrophone? Yes, I do. But I don't sell them at this hour. At this hour, I sleep. Dearest, rip his screen off. Give me that. Oh no! Stop it, I'm coming down! I'm coming down! I never thought I'd see the day! This is the top of the range, with two loudspeakers Bass and treble are separate. Auto-stop. However the price is not the same. The price. We could buy your store. I only mentioned it because I also have the junior model. No, I've got one: it's no use to us. You've probably heard enough now. Add a packet of discs. What sort shall I include? Just music. It's for me to sing-along. Gladys, have you heard of me? 'Le Mistigri'. Nantes... And he claims... Well I never! I'll wrap this up for you and fetch your warranty. So you don't get wet, I'll carry you. Oh, I can manage. No, I'll carry you. I don't want you getting your feet wet. You are tiresome. - Come on, let's go. Come on! Hey, Émile! Make up your mind. Huh? - Never mind. Come on! Here we go! My sing-alongs are ruined. This is typical. Look at me! Oh, love is such a dream. Oh là là! -Les Melons. Soon as bought, soon as broke! Ah, you know... It disgusts you to make someone happy. Are you going to shut up, eh? Come on, no more discs, no more need of a record player. This is what I do with your trash! Can we get some sleep when you've finished? What's up with them? Forget about it. I'm the one who doesn't understand. Ha! I despise them. We don't answer to losers. We leave you to your insalubrious little world. We're not on the same planet. Come on, Mimile. Come on, let's hear some more. Are you listening? Hold on... Look here. What's that? Put this in your bag. Don't lose it, it's our warranty card. You'll go back, then? Oh, shit! Keep it down, I'll have another migraine. If you boozed less, you wouldn't get your migraines. Neither would I, for that matter. Can't you be nice for two days' running? That would be something. Tell me... Under current laws, how long after the marriage can we start divorce proceedings? Eh? That depends? That depends, that depends.. on what? Mr. Bouet is here, sir. - One moment. Yes, well... It's for me, yes. Yes, for me. Yes. Drop by tonight. That's it. Yes. My dear friend, when one attains a certain social standing, we are at the mercy of certain contingencies. One example, I loved the accordion: my father inflicted a violin teacher on me. And I made my daughter learn the piano. Because the accordion, that would never do. You see what I'm trying to say? I'm not very fond of the accordion either. When I say the accordion I mean a way of life, the choice of the people you frequent. Bah! A fellow like you knows this better than me. Let's get back to business. I've had a draft contract prepared. Do you want us to read through it or would you rather that as businessmen... We should be able to get through it. Yes. Gentlemen, let me introduce to you the new Master-at-Arms. Plévedec, chief mechanic. Camus, fisherman. You know him. And Ardouin, radio. From now on, if something goes wrong in your field, you refer it to Mr. Bouet. No longer to me. Hi, chaps. Would you care to finish running the motor winch? I've not finished setting it up yet. Why's that? My mechanic is at his sister's wedding. Then, let's have ourselves a little inspection. You're going to have to give up your scheme. What scheme? The one where you treat me like a chump. For the motor you've bought Émile and for your license, bravo! That you're surprising him, re-bravo, but don't mention the car's from me. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. I've driven cars. Even sport models. I don't know how it is with sport models, but with this one it's like this: you have first at the bottom, second at the top, reverse at the top of the bottom. And 3rd and 4th? Just go to the forward and reverse gears. Try to take it easy. - Trust me. Phone, hurry up! Easy. That jerk didn't see me coming. Lyrical artist? - Singer, yes. The lady sings in the shower? Gladys, you never heard of me? No. You're just like him! Watch out, I might show you. Show me your license. There's no need to be brusque. It seems to be working. It was the injector. It's running smoothly now. Let go of me. This takes the biscuit. Will you let go of me? You're making a big mistake because I'll have you all sacked. There you go. - You hear? All of you. It's gonna get ugly. Émile Bouet! Yes? Something annoying's cropped up. That person you live with, the one I try to ignore... Fernande? - Yes.. She's just been arrested by the police. Driving without a license. Resisting arrest and disturbance on the public highway. The full house, what! Okay, I'm coming. François Larmentiel. - The commissioner called me. That woman can go. You want to tell her yourself? You're free to go. All the same! It's not a pity. You can't know what louts they are. Will you shut it? Me shut up? That's a good one! Molested, put in a cage... Should I say thanks? One of them called me an old trout. What? Which one said that? You don't think that's enough for one day? You go ahead. This has been some sort of day. - Go on! You know how it is, sir. There are days when some people fly off the handle... Keep your own house in order. He said neither hello nor goodbye. What a rude character! That takes the biscuit! - Why? You really don't have a clue. You make a scandal on my first day and you're complaining? That's nice that. - Thanks, I had some help. Your boss snubs me, they insult me and you say nowt? Say what? Isn't this enough for you? By the way, I've had it up here with your accordion. I think I'm going to try the piano. - What? I know what I mean. - But Emile!... Émile, wait for me. Ah, dear Émile! I thought you might not be able to make it. You can't know how happy I am to see you here. Mr. Bouet, our new Master-at-Arms. My daughter, Claude. Sir. Delighted to meet you, miss. Whisky, pastis, champagne? You'd prefer a small glass of white wine? My brother-in-law's muscadet is a marvel. My dear, go and tell Robert to open a bottle. Not if it's too much trouble. - Oh no. Claude loves household affairs. I raised her that way. A B.A. in English, but the household arts. Modern culture, but the old principles. Oh, it's the only way! My dear Émile, you know the affection I have for you. I'm sorry about the incident from this afternoon. The main thing is it's been taken care of, but it's vital that it shouldn't happen again. Regarding that, you can count on me. I've taken strict measures. Why "measures"? Wouldn't one be enough? Daddy, would you come here a moment, please? Excuse me. Sit down. We're looking for your white wine. No need to, miss. Drink and me... Really! I thought nautical types got on well with the bottle. If you're chatting with the fishing boss, of course. But when one's in business like your father and me, one should lay off the hard stuff. You've no more cigarettes? - Yes. Where? - The machine. What machine? The machine, there. That thing in front of you. This isn't working. It has to be the filter is clogged. Then unclog it. If I do that now, you won't get your coffee before noon. You know, I've been thinking. Instead of a car, we should buy a coffee machine. Okay, it's not as useful. The car brings other satisfactions. We had some of those yesterday. What's this? - What? This thing you're wearing. - You don't like it? There's no one better than Florette. She needs a slap, your Florette. - Gracious of you. I'm starving. - Well, eat. There's the coffee. And here's the sugar. Sugar is served in a sugar bowl. And it comes via tongs. If it's not one thing... Ah, obviously, you're not like the Larmentiels... Still... It's to be expected, you've always lived with losers. You don't say. Same thing with your slippers. Don't you see? People would laugh. If someone visited... Take it all together: we live in a trailer park. I can't see Ms. Larmentiel leaving her knickers on the living room floor! I'm talking in a vacuum: you understand nothing. You're pissing me off and I don't mean a little bit! Are you becoming so puffed up? Now you're talking in quotation marks. Yesterday, it was the accordion, today, it's Ms. Larmentiel. This is going great. Since you started hanging with the bourgeoisie, are you ashamed of me? If you like it there so much, move in. I'm out of here. Sacrificing one's career to such a bastard. Fat-head! Forgotten anything? Yes, you. And forever. Don't say that, you'll wound me terribly. Here's the rest of your money for the week. Your cash. Buy yourself some sugar tongs. Guys, brace yourselves. Are you ready? I kicked Fernande out. There! This makes just one more time. We'll drink to the reunion. Don't count on it. You don't know Émile. I never look back. We've heard this before. - Not like this. Never again. After two years in jail, I'm raring to go. And if I get involved with another woman, she'll be the indoors' type. I'm a new man, eyes fixed on the future. And give us that. I'm in charge of 15 boats and here I am catching lobsters for tourists. Gotta roll with it! Especially as you don't have Fernande anymore. I loved her lots, you know. Help me with this. There's more to life than the sack. Or else, you're doing yourself a disservice. Women are good for only one thing, that or the kitchen. Karma Sutra or beef stew, take your pick! You can't have both. If she'd been as good at food as in the sack, she'd have opened a boarding house. Who? - Fernande. You son of a bitch! Don't bad-mouth my old lady! Don't do this! - Maybe I will at that! I can't swim! - It's time to learn! I was only saying what you'd said, for God's sake! I can say what I like, understand, and Fernande's none of your business! Boarding houses can piss off. I don't want to hear another word. Next time, you'll be dealing with them. What? - The lobsters. Didn't you like the rabbit? Yes. Why aren't you eating? The beaujolais must have spoilt my appetite. You drank two. Normally, it's ten. Then it must be fatigue. I'm going to bed. Goodbye, Camille. Bye, Léon. Good night, Émile. You should ask him what's up. Certainly not. Especially as I know what it is. What? Eight months ago, he hit Gaston. This time, he almost drowned Marcelin. If you're curious, I'm not. Ho, Léon! Lend me your key, I'll give it back tomorrow. Which key? - The key to your car. You want to finish it off for me? - Just hand it over, will you?! The registration document is... You in such a rush? In the pocket! That one... You are certain that this is indeed your will? Your despondency proves to me that you've understood me very well. Okay. I'll read it to you again. "I institute as my sole heir "Mr. Émile Bouet, resident of La Rochelle. "Any dispositions made previously are null and void. "Signed: Charles-Edmond Larmentiel." A simple verbal warning: don't you dare, my dear sir, try to swap sides. I don't see where you're going with this. To this: if my brother gets the idea to frustrate in any way the provisions we've just made, Sister Angélique will unveil the emergency will. You've made another one? Yes! In which it says that if Émile Bouet is disinherited in any manner whatsoever, my wealth goes to the Jesuits. To scam them, down there, hello! Isn't that so, sister? # 3 Like a ship that sinks Like a curtain that falls # # On a theatre of shadows the day is coming to an end. # # One more day is added to our long journey. # # Where we are heading our dreams don't know. # # Nestled next to each other we look back on our mistakes # # and put the blame on others for the mistakes we've made. # # Don't expect a miracle. Life is but a show # # Here is the last act. Everything starts anew # # Our love is like life # # It seems so simple # # But under its appearance of indifference # # It is torment. # # Our love is like life # # It takes us as an example # # And flows elusively like sand. # Nice of you to come see me. - I was passing by. Things okay? With you too, I see. I still have a good table. The commissioner's sitting at it. You arrived at the right moment. Can I get you a drink? - A beer. # He's our sad child # # But at least he exists # # He has this habit of double solitude # # that we call love. # # Our love is like life # # It takes us an example. # - Okay, we've heard it! # And flows elusively like sand. # - Show us your ass, that would be an improvement. # It has your inconsistency # Get your kit off! # And my ever changing moods. # # Overcome by problems # # sometimes even of his own making # # He's our sad child # # But at least he exists # Émile! Barman, some water! Émile? Émile? Do something. Don't just leave them like that. Emile? You're in pain? I wanted to tell you... You know, your song tonight... it was very good. You might kiss me first. Don't complicate things. Every time, in this car, it's shameful. What's making you laugh? - You. Sir got carried away, and now he regrets it. What should I regret? I've nothing to regret. You don't know what it is to have 15 boats! - In any event, I'm not surprised. Yes, but I'm a loser thanks to you. Oh, she's severe, that one! If that's it, tell me. It wasn't me that called. You came looking for me. And the thing is, you were there. - I could leave anytime. What is it with you? What did I say? What? When a good woman doesn't want to understand... Explain it to me: I'll understand better. Well, it's very simple. It couldn't be more simple. Then tell me simply. - Don't cut me off! It's this... I don't want to lose you because of Larmentiel, and I don't want to lose Larmentiel because of you. I started as a cabin boy at 13. And I'm about to become someone. 15 boats, respectability, retirement, all that... Fernande, put yourself in my shoes! Try also to put yourself in mine a little. You come, you go, you take me, you reject me. I put up with it, I said nothing. You have to know what you want. What I want is... It's the boats by day... and you at night. Because I... I can't do without you. For that, I'd have to stop loving you. Obviously, when we no longer love each other, it's a cinch. One walks out, the other doesn't care. Unfortunately, we're not there yet. - No. Not yet. You don't want to understand, you're like Marcelin. I said to him earlier: "In life, it's not just the sack." Oh yeah, what else? - Well, there's... My poor big lug, come on. You've been thinking too much. You're exhausted. You never learned in school that you can't combine boats and good women. Come, let's sleep. This will calm us down. For pity's sake! If he didn't want to have lunch, he should've said. We've not seen him all morning. You seem to be tucking in. In Nantes, I lost 2 kilos. Because you were in Nantes? - Sort of, yes! I was in 'Le Mistigri'. So what? Wasn't it working out? - Not working out? Ha! I made a rod for my own back. Every evening was packed out. However they weren't exactly my sort of audience. Mr. Bouet, please? There's nobody at home. Give him this. It's on behalf of Mr. Larmentiel. Consider it done. - I'll take care of it. I'm his woman. I'm relying on you. They never say "good morning", his type. It said he wants to see me, that's all. I don't think it's going to be to congratulate me. A coffee will restore you. You don't think I'm on edge enough as it is? How about some chamomile? Chamomile... You ever see me drink chamomile? Goodbye. - Well, a sugar. What? - A sugar! I'm not deaf. - No, but you are short-sighted. Right, see you later. You asked to see me It's nothing. Just a small bump. Pity. Come in. Do you know who this person is? It's Mr. Larmentiel. Yes. And he's your grand-father. I haven't summoned you here to reproach you for your misdeeds, but to settle a family matter. You are my brother's son. He'd gone to live in Tahiti I can do nothing about it, my dear nephew, you are a Larmentiel. This is why I've been trying everything. Everything. To undo the damage, to make the Larmentiel that you are, the Larmentiel you could become. You've ruined it all. For example, the return of you-know-who. I've offered you a situation. Better yet, I've laid out your progression. Every ambition was permitted to you. The director's chair, definitely. Partnership, no question. And marriage, possibly. You are 40, my daughter is 28. Consider your best interests. Take a look at yourself. I leave you two together. You know, I was thinking about last night... Is your mother still in Rouen? - Yes. How long is it since you saw her? 8 years. Something like that. And don't you miss her? Not in the slightest. When she's dead, you'll say to yourself you should have gone. Believe me, I know what it's like. Well, this doesn't look good, Émile. - Oh yes, all's well. It'll be even better tomorrow. Fernande returns to her mother tonight. Really? - Talking of which, I need a ticket for Rouen. One-way or return? No, one-way. I'll arrange it at once. This evening, I can't bring your lobsters before 10pm. No problem, I've some left. It's on-again, off-again. If you must know! I'm in no mood to please people. - Bring them whenever, don't get angry. Will you need me? I'm not sure, I'll see. I need to know. - I told you: "I'll see!" Oh, shit! I worked like that when they fired me. I'll clean it up. Give me another. So Mimile, you're paying for it? Come on. Let's play dice. I'll show you how it's done. Are you going or what? - Well yes, of course! Oh, shit... Hurry up, Fernande. - Yes, but it's chilly out. I'm ready. Move it, you'll miss your train. I've forgotten my gloves. Give me the key. Here. Let's go. Émile, did you hear! Shit! I forgot to raise my casters. You can do it tomorrow. Let's go now, we've just enough time. Now? Come on then! Haven't we gone far enough as it is? Is this why you've been drinking? You want to kill me. My poor Émile. Fernande. Fernande! But... I told you sir isn't there. The other one, where is he? A little tact, Mr. Bouet. Tact? What tact? - Your father has just died. He rests in his room. Ah, because in addition he's been there? You're a nice bunch of scumbags! I want the other one. The uncle. The keen conversationalist. Has he left for Tahiti, him? Mr. Bouet, your grief leads you astray. You, fatso, you're part of this. Therefore, a little tact from you too or I'll smash your face in. To think that it was for trash like this that I almost did in Fernande. Poor jerk, eh? I almost did it. Yes! To be nice, to be ingratiating! Because of grand-father! Oh yes, the other bastard! There were four of you. There were four of you. And you let this happen. We would have been five if you'd come down... Fernande? You can eat? - Well, yeah. Sit down. You've warmed back up? You want another dozen? You don't fancy some white wine? Now you're talking! Camille, there's no white wine. She didn't ask me for some. "She"? Can't you say "Fernande"? It's true, that... No. You haven't packed your suitcase? - No. And... Ah no. You don't want to go up? Ah... Yes, and not... I could carry you if you're tired. Here's the white wine. You're not eating? Well... - Yes, he's eating. I'll grill you a lobster. Oh well, you know... In any case, you're having fun. We couldn't really split up. We have too much fun.
