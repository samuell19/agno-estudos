Don't you just love it? The smell of cocoa and candy canes swirling in the snowy air. It's almost Christmas, the best time of year. The time when every child's Christmas wish is about to come true. Even his. That's Theo. He's new in town. Hey! Hey, over here! Oh, h-hi. - Hey! Awesome. - Huh? Wait. You know what? We should build another snowman. They could be best friends. Whoa, that's a great idea. Yeah. We can have our own sleepover. Right, Frankie? Sure. We'll stay up late like best friends, and stare at each other, 'cause my eyes don't shut. You get it? These are the jokes. I just wish... I wish... Ha. Look. That's me. Up there. The star Theo's wishing on. My name is Blizzard, but my friends call me Blizz. And this is the story of how Theo and I tried to save Christmas... after I, you know, kind of, sort of, maybe, made a total mess of things to begin with. Let's rewind back to yesterday. Back to where it all started. My home, the jolliest place on Earth. Excuse me. Pardon me. Watch out. Move it or lose it. Coming through. Oh! Come on, Candy. Shake your flakes. I'm coming, Blizz. Huh? We have liftoff in three, two, one! And he's airborne. Oh, gosh. Oh! Oh! Take cover, people! - This is not a drill! - Huh? -Huh? Excuse me, Donner. I-I'm in a big rush. Huge fan, by the way. Okay, goodbye. I will have a half-caf venti latte. With candy canes on top. Good luck with the big presentation, Blizz! - Go, go. - You got this, Blizz. - Go, go, go. - Make us reindeers proud! Thanks, guys. I can't believe we're skipping out on work for your appointment with the Big Man himself. It'll be fine, Candy. Today's the day Santa Claus will finally know my name. Oh, it's the best time of the year. Hey, how you doing? Hey, I gotta go make some copies. All right, hey, did you get the bonus? Do you need anything from the supply room? Uh, hi. I have a delivery here for a Smiley Gumdrops. Hey, do you know what happened to the copy machine? Hi, I'm Blizzard, checking in for my 02:00. Okay, here we go. There you are. Wait a minute. Blizzard the Reindeer? Aren't you the one that crashed into the toy factory and caused that Cabbage Patch Kid shortage years ago? Blizz was born with Aeronautical Imbalance Syndrome. His mismatched antlers... You see them?... They cause him to crash. A lot. Okay, Candy, you're oversharing a little bit there. Thank you. Now, about our meeting with the Big Man. Sorry, no can do. Santa's stuck working the Snow Globe Tower tonight. A ton of wishes just came in, so you're out of luck, my man. No, no, totally, totally. I get it. Wishes are more important than my little presentation... that I've been working on for six years, three months, two days, not counting. Hold on a gift-wrapped minute here. Smiley Gumdrops! You're... y-you're Santa's Head of Holiday Operations. The big H.O.H.O. himself! That's right. I've been Santa's second-in-command for 500 years. We haven't canceled an appointment yet, so come on. I mean, why am I even here? It is always hectic around here the week before Christmas. Whoa! Whoa! Is that the original sketch for your most famous creation, Santa's Snow Globe? Is it true that it can hear children's wishes from all around the world? Indeed, and it stores all the wishes inside. Well, you know, it's the invention that landed me the job as Santa's H.O.H.O. Oh, sometimes I miss those early days, imagining all the fun ways to help Santa make Christmas even better. Yeah! Blizz wants to be an inventor, just like you used to be. And, oh, and he has a vision board with pics of you and Santa. And one of you, but his own head is pasted on yours. It's really, really funny. You gotta s... Sorry. Oversharing. I hear it. No one loves Christmas more than me. I-I just want one big idea that'll change Christmas forever. I'll let you in on something I discovered after 500 years in this job as H.O.H.O. Santa is not always a big fan of change. Uh-oh. But I'm always looking to prove him wrong. So hit me with your best shot. - Yes! - Feliz Navidad! Let's do this. The portable Christmas tree. Now you can take Christmas with you anywhere you go. Goodness! This is a lot of tree! I don't think this is the one. I don't think it's going to work out. Oh, but please, keep trying! I actually thought that went well. Blizz! Candy! You blew off work today to make an even bigger mess? You're both pulling double shifts till Valentine's Day. Starting now! Hey, guys. Sorry about the double duty. We got you something. Yeah, it was supposed to say, "Congrats"... before we heard what happened. What? I was stress eating. Blizz, you know we love you, but your inventions never seem to turn out exactly how you want them to. Maybe it's time to... take a break? One day, I'll show Santa what I can really do. Baby doll to love as my own. A chess set. Oh, and peace on Earth. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. How many wishes in the Globe today, Smiley? 473,000,000 and counting, Santa. But, you know... Ho, ho, ho, isn't that just great? Yes, it is, but actually, you know what, I'm a little concerned about how are you going to handle so...? Yes, sir! Thanks to you, this Snow Globe allows me to fulfill the special wishes that each child will remember forever. Oh, yeah. It's-It's a true Christmas miracle. But do you think you can keep up with this growing demand forever? Oh, gee. You're right, Smiley. I can't keep doing any of this... without a candy cane burrito. Dinner's on me, Smiley. Oh, cheer up. I got you again. Let's go. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho... I just know I have more to offer than picking up trash. I wish I could make my mark on Christmas. Too bad the Snow Globe only hears kids' wishes. If yours was in it, Santa would have to grant it. Candy, that's it! You're a genius. Oh, yay! Ah, we'll sneak in and find a way to put my wish inside the Snow Globe. Oh, I love this plan. Uh... plan? Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho. It is I, the Santa Claus. The real Santa. Who is me. I'm Santa! Yes. The really real Santa Claus is with me, Smiley, just like any normal day. Evening, Bob. Good evening, Smiley, Santa. Is that Santa's old mitten you bought on Elf Bay last year? Oh, that's cool, Blizz. Welcome, Santa Claus. We're in. Hold up. Did you just hear some ominous music? Mm... nope. Ow. Well, that decked my halls. There it is. The wishiest wish collector that ever was. Now, how do I do this? Hello. Hi. Blizz here. Uh, I'd like to make a wish, please. Uh... I wish... I wish that Santa would... Give it to me! Geez, Candy, wait your turn. And what's happened to your voice? I'll take that. Who the scrooge is that? No, no, no! Bring that Snow Globe back! Globe secured. Whoa! Blizz! I'm coming! Hold on! Oh, no. It's now or never. I vote for never. Beginning descent. Whoa! You? Give it back! No! The Globe! No. I should've thought this through...! Got it! Had it. I just wish... I wish... We need to find the Snow Globe before that little reindeer ruins all of our plans. Sorry. Just passing through. What? You-you can talk? And sing. But that can wait. I'm on a top secret mission. Someone stole Santa's Snow Globe. Santa? A-As in Santa Claus? Okay. Easy, Theo. You're-you're hallucinating. You hit your head, brain's hemorrhaging. If this was really happening, Mom and Dad would've heard the crash and come running in already. Oh, oh. Yeah, high score! This big hooded guy stole Santa's Snow Globe. Then I tried to get it back. Then it fell out of the rocket sleigh and it landed somewhere in your town, and now I need to find it. I-I would love to help, but my family just moved here a month ago. Maybe you could ask someone else, like a firefighter? Uh-uh, only kids can hear me. Come on. That's North Pole Magic 101. Besides, right now, I only know two people in this town. You and... wait. Wait, where's Candy?! Hello! Nice to meet you. I'll be right up. I'm getting dizzy again. Can't you both just fly back to Santa for help? You saw how Blizz flies. We won't get halfway to the Easter Bunny's hole without breaking our necks. Ta-da! Also, it kind of maybe... might be my fault the Snow Globe was stolen. Oh... I'm in deep cocoa. Christmas, the one thing I love the most in this world, might not happen because of me. So, pretty please with gumdrops on top, can you help me fix this? Once we get the Snow Globe back, Santa would be so grateful. I'm sure he'd give you anything you want as a reward. You really think so? Anything? You name it. - Toys. - Yeah. - Video games. - Do it. - Whatever you wish for. - Help us. Okay, I'm in. - Joy to the world. - Yeah! But first, we need to get some materials. I bet we can find that Snow Globe before anyone even realizes it's gone. Snow Globe, Snow Globe, Snow Globe! I have no idea what to make! Okay, okay, please, every... Oh, come on, please. Santa and I need you to-to remain jolly. And you! definitely no reason to hoard the candy canes. We have our top investigators on the job. These are professionals. I have complete confidence in their ability to handle this. Oh! Did you find anything yet? Uh, we, uh, usually investigate cases like, "Who used all the wrapping paper?" Or "Who's my Secret Santa?" Uh, this one's... this one's complicated. - All right, watch your backs. - Coming through. Sir, look what I found by the crime scene. Wowie! Our first clue. - Ever! - Yeah! Blizzard? Case is cracked, everyone. Blizzard stole the Snow Globe. No, not Blizz. It couldn't be. Sorry. Come on, this way. And please be quiet. I don't know where your phone is. - Oh, no. - Do you want me to call it? Do I need a coat? Is it cold out? Theodore. What is that? Uh... Aw, he's adorable. Theo, what's going on here? Did you take in a stray? - This cute lumpkins - Uh... is part of the family now. Hey, look. Theo made a snowgirl. That dog's already having a good influence. - That should go there... - What exactly are you building? Just a little something to help find the Snow Globe. - But I need more tinsel. - Yep. On it. Whoa. What's this? It-it's nothing. Well, kind of looks like a puppet. Can I see it? I guess so. This is Frankie. I taught myself ventriloquism. I'm alone... a lot. Why are you alone... a lot? Because of my mom's job. We've lived in six towns in seven years. It's hard to make friends when you're always the new kid. Sometimes... I just feel like I'm invisible. You feel like you're invisible? That bland sweater is like suburban camouflage. These are the jokes, folks. I know, I'm weird. Just don't tell anyone. Weird? That was so cool. Weird is just another word for different. And different is normal. It isn't something to hide. I mean, look at me. The garage was a gold mine. Hey, look who it is. A talking snow cone. Wow! A talking... whatever you are. Name's Frankie. And is your name Melty, or is that just what you do? Behold! The most monumental invention these hooves have ever built, the Yule Detector! Santa's Snow Globe emits massive levels of yuletide cheer, and this will help us locate it. Cool. Or should I say, yule? Good luck wearing that in public. Me? Why do you think we need you? Oh, snap. I told you, I-I just want to blend in. Ah, stop. Now, come on. We've got a Snow Globe to find. - Oh... - Bye. Good luck. Hmm... Hmm. Nice wackpack. Is that a weirdo detector? Whoa. Whoa. Hmm. Getting closer. Any minute now. Any day now. Don't even think about it. Milk and cookies to Little Drummer Boy. Now just three days till Christmas. Any luck? Not yet. Just taking a short rest. Cool. What? I have to blend in and act like all the other regular dogs. Oh, I saw that. I got a laugh. Admit it, we're having fun. Oh, no! Hide! Her name is Isla. She's the smartest kid in school. And funny. And-and she collects bugs, and... You like her. What? No, no. I never said that. Ha, gotcha! Hey, what's that on your back? Hunting Christmas ghosts? Let's get him! Run for cover! We're under attack! Whoa, whoa. Oh! Oh, my goodness. I-I'm so, so sorry. I was chased by this group of, like, ten mega-huge guys - Uh-huh. - And they were coming after me. Neat backpack. You really have the Christmas spirit, huh? Uh... Oh, that's my mom. Got to go. How'd it go? You put a ring on it? What? We haven't saved Christmas yet. Walrus Cronkite, with breaking news. It's only three days until Christmas, and the Snow Globe is still missing. I can't, I can't. I can-I can't watch this. My anxiety is spiking through the roof. It's making my fur fall out. - Look at this. - Hey, hey, hey. Let's focus here. Blizz and Candy need us. We have to find out what really happened. Let's do it. Let's order a pizza! Oh, sorry. I zoned out for a bit. What were you guys talking about? Reindeer in Herewill continue. This is CBS. Leave me alone. Because of you, I'm now a target for bullies, and-and Isla thinks I'm a lunatic. I'm sorry. .This week has been a stocking full of coal for me, too. - Hmm. - But, hey, whenever I feel down, - I like to get a change of view. - Wait. Whoa! I-I thought you were a terrible flier. Compared to Comet and Cupid? Yes. Compared to you, I'm amazing! Whoa. This is actually... Okay. Yeah. This is incredible. Air pocket! Oh! Oh, oh, oh. There's a reason I'm named Blizzard! Oh, hey, that was close. Oh. I got you. You know, the night you crashed through my window, I actually thought you were a shooting star at first. I was about to make a Christmas wish. Oh. Can I guess what you were wishing for? I love this game. Yeah. A junior inventor's kit. No, no, no. A new bike. Am I warm? Nope. Got a bike last Christmas. Which was great, but less fun when you have no one to ride it with. Oh, you were wishing for something elves can't build. A friend. Come on. I get it. A new school every year, new people to meet. I don't even know how you do it. It's fine, really. I like my alone time. It lets me practice. I'm Candy, Blizz's bestest friend. What? Oh, my... You're a wizard. You sound just like her. You should show people your talent. Nope. No way. I don't need everyone knowing I'm a weirdo. Ah. Stop. My inventions make me look like a weirdo at the North Pole. But I know one day one of my ideas will change Christmas. Don't hide what makes you unique. The detector! Merriment is spiking. Jolliness levels in the red. We must be close! Look. There it is. I'll take that. I'm guessing that's the bad guy. Well, you guessed right. Thank you for leading me to it again. - We gotta catch him. - How? If you think I'm flying on your back again... Nope. I've got a better idea. This is not a better idea. Over there. Hang on! Candy! You okay back there? Ha! We got him! We don't got him. By the authority of the North Pole, I command you to stop! Yeah, I didn't think that'd work. Huh. A cloaking device? I've only seen one of those at... The North Pole! This whole thing's giving me an ulcer - the size of a Christmas goose. - Uh-huh. Tell me more about this Christmas goose. Christmas Eve is tomorrow, and we still got nothing. Or do we? Meet Snicklefritz. I work at the fruitcake factory, right across from the Snow Globe Tower. I was filming a baking tutorial for my Yule Tube channel when I caught this. We need to show this to Smiley. It could save Blizz... and Christmas. Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. We're running out of time. Ooh. Oh, there must be a way past this cloaking device - we haven't thought of yet. - Mm. Come on. We need to use our brains. Aw. Or maybe we need someone else's brains. And who has the biggest brain you know? Oh, no. No, no, no. No way. Not Isla. But you said it yourself, she's the smartest girl in school. Ooh, she sounds nice. I said no way, and that's final. Hmm. Wow. Hi-Hi, Isla. What a coincidence seeing you here. At my home? Hi, there. I'm a talking reindeer. Yes, it's cool and magical. We could go over all this later. But what Theo's trying to say is we're on a mission from the North Pole, and we need your help! Uh, uh... - Uh-uh... - Hi. Theo says you're smart and pretty and smell good. - No, no, no, no, no. - And, uh, a long list of other things, too. I forgot. Uh... Uh... Great. You two melted her mind. Hooded guys, cloaking devices? Hold up. Oh, my gosh. Are you the same Isla Williamson who asked Santa to bring you mealworms last Christmas? - It's a pleasure meeting you. - It's a pleasure, it's a pleasure. You're a celebrity at the North Pole. No other kid's ever asked for bugs as a stocking stuffer. This is all so... So... Don't say weird. I just happen to love bugs. They're nature's marvels. Uh... I-I was going to say it's awesome. Besides, what's wrong with weird? Okay, look, Isla. You've lived here all your life. Any idea what might be hidden behind that cloaking device? Not a frozen lake. That area was the site of the old McReedy Toy factory. It shut down years ago. Good news is I may know another way past the cloaking device. My mom's the town director of public works. Cool. See? These drainage tunnels go under the town and the old toy factory. So we don't have to go through the force field. We can go under it. We? Yeah, no. We never said I'm going. But Christmas Eve is tomorrow. You can't say no to Christmas. We'll put in a good word to Santa. He'll get you all the maggots you want. I can't believe I'm doing this. Who are you supposed to be? You can call me Frozen Justice! If my calculations are correct, that hatch should look right up into the old toy factory. Okay, but how do we get to the ladder? Well, you're a reindeer. Can't you fly up there? - Uh, yeah. - No, no, no, no. - I can totally fly up there. - No, no, no... Whoa, oh! See? Easy as Christmas pie...! Oh. Teamwork. Roast my chestnuts on an open fire. Robots? More like Ornament-Bots. Looks like the abandoned toy factory is back in business. The Snow Globe must be up there. Jingle-jangle, it's hot in here. I can really go for a pint of eggnog right about now. Who's buying? - Not it. - Hey. I bought last time. Just when I thought this couldn't get any crazier. 'Tis the season. Smiley? Where is he? We have proof that Blizz is innocent. Does anyone want this donut? Wait a minute. Hey, why does Smiley have a drawing of the hooded man's rocket sled? What? No. Now, now, now. It's not nice to peek under the tree before Christmas. Ooh, that's tight. Smiley? You're behind all of this? Once you see what I've planned, Santa is going to thank me for this. You all will. Oh, man! How are my bots doing, building all those wonderful toys? Um... My bots just need a little fine-tuning, you know? Giddy up, my jingle elves, pick up your feet. Smiley is behind all this? This makes no sense. Oh, now what are we going to do? Don't worry. I have a plan. When the next bot rolls by, we pounce on it. Then we'll reset its programming. We'll send our new champion back in there with me riding shotgun. Ha! Meanwhile, you guys find Smiley's sleigh and swoop down to get me. How are we supposed to know how to reprogram a robot or fly a sleigh? Watch and learn. Hyah! Now, that unraveled in record time. You're Santa's H.O.H.O. Why would you do this? Why would you take the Snow Globe? Because I needed the children's wishes. That Snow Globe was the last of my inventions that Santa ever used. He's stuck in his old ways. So now you want to ruin Christmas? No, I'm just borrowing Christmas. I'm gonna give it back next year after Santa sees how much easier it can all be. Yeah. I'm doing it for him. But Christmas is wonderful just the way it is. Oh, for now. But the world's population keeps growing. What if the elves couldn't make enough toys? What if Santa gets too fat and he couldn't fit down every chimney? What if the Snow Globe runs out of space for wishes? I just couldn't take that chance. Doing all this behind Santa's back doesn't sound like you're helping. The H.O.H.O. retires after his 500th Christmas. This one is my last. So it's my last chance to prove to Santa that there is a better way. Come on. You're an inventor, Blizz. You get it. There's always a better way. But you should have run it by Santa first. You need to trust him. There's still time to make it right. Please, don't do this. Santa will thank us. - Right? - Eh. Forget all that time Santa waste climbing down chimneys. Now your present cannon will blast toys down them instead. Blizz, what's our plan? My plan? I'm out of plans. I'm just sorry for getting you into this. I used to think I could do something special, make a difference. But the truth is, Smiley's right. I'm no better than him. I'm a reindeer who can't fly straight. I-I have terrible ideas, and I just helped ruin Christmas. Blizz, please. We could still fix this. No, we can't. I'm a failure. Always have been, always will be. Orna-bots. Free the prisoners immediately. - Huh. - Now, go make me a fruitcake. Oh, my. You had at least one good idea. Telling me not to hide my talents. Didn't know you had it in you, new kid. - That was pretty... - Please, don't say weird. I was going to say awesome. Besides, what's wrong with weird? Elves, the toilets are clogged. Go plunge them. Oh, gross. Oh, way to ruin Christmas Eve. Different is good, right? - Yes! - Yay! I always knew that antler would come in handy one day. You two need to shut down the cloaking device's force field before we can fly out. Theo and I will hold these things off. Why are you three plunging toilets? Uh, because you told us to. Ho-ho-holy plum pudding. Hey, how did you two get free? - Oh-oh. - Uh-oh is right. Look. That must control the force field. Fruitcake. Smiley, please. These toys are a disaster. You'll never be able to fix them in time. Do you really want children waking up to see all their Christmas dreams ruined? Listen to the voices. You have a good heart. I know you want to make Christmas better, but this isn't the way to do it. This can't be the Christmas you imagined. I just wanted to help. To leave Christmas in good hands. Oh, I'm a fool. Santa will never forgive me. Yes, he will. He's Santa. - Thank you, Smiley. - Yay! Orna-bots are programmed to protect the Snow Globe at all costs. Even I can't override them. Whoa...! - Oh, my gosh. - Whoa. I really hope Isla and Candy got the force field open. Good luck, you, too! I think these bots operate on a metaheuristic intelligence, just like the Formosan termite! Isla, I know I'm a talking snowgirl, but I have no idea what that means. Big beeping one sends commands. Knock it out and they all go down. Got it. It's Frozen Justice time! Ah! And not a creature was stirring. All right. Isla and Candy haven't shut the force field down yet. It's never too late for a Christmas miracle. Oh, boy. It's now or never, Isla. Bugs. They're nature's marvels. Whoo-hoo! Yay. We did it. Now, I wish we knew how to get this thing back to the North Pole in time. Theo, oh, it looks like your wish is about to come true. He'll come back for me. Yeah. Right? Tomorrow is Christmas, and it pains me to say it, but without the Snow Globe, we just don't know all of the children's wishes. I'm sorry. - Christmas is can... - Whoa! Santa, what's that? Still trying to stick the landing. Oh, Blizzard. - You know my name? - Of course. I've always known it. But what I don't know is why you took the Snow Globe. He didn't do it. Smiley had us tied up. Smiley is the one that took the Globe. Smiley? But th-that can't be true. It is. Uh, but he only took it to make Christmas easier for you. But he realized what he was doing was wrong, so he gave it to us, and we brought it back. I always knew you were innocent. Ho, ho, thank you, Blizzard and Theodore. I hope we're not too late. It-It's still Christmas Eve, and every child's wish is almost ready to be delivered. Well, not every child's wish. Theo didn't finish making his yet. That's okay, Blizz. I already got my wish. I made a new friend. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Looks like Christmas is back on, everyone. Yay! Yes! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Okay, Theodore, time to head home. Wait. Blizz, you're coming with me, right? I... I can't. My place is here. But this can't be goodbye. Oh. It'll be okay. Just keep being you, and I'll be here, rooting for you every step of the way. Interesting. Looks like there's room for one more up here. You think I'd separate two best friends on a night like tonight? Besides, we have your future to discuss, Blizzard. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho... So that's the story of how I almost ruined Christmas. And ended up with a new friend instead. Santa knew that Smiley and his crew were sorry, and discovered that his new inventions were actually pretty helpful. He even gave Smiley a new job, where he could finally put his amazing inventions to work. Ho, ho, yeah. Candylicious! Turns out I did have a great idea, one that changed Christmas forever. So there's a reindeer in here and a reindeer in here. After the Snow Globe was stolen and nearly lost, I realized Santa needed a better, more personal way to learn each child's Christmas wish. Each child is unique, just like every one of us. The thing that makes each of us different is also the thing that makes us amazing. A boy named Theo reminded me of that. So then I say to them, "Go bake me a fruitcake." You believe it? Hey-yo! These are the jokes, folks. Whoa! Whoa! - Whoa! - Whoa! Oh! I stuck the landing. Blizz, what are you doing here? We're all here. Each reindeer has been sent out to be a new Christmas friend to each child. We'll spend time with them, find out what makes them unique, and learn what their true holiday wishes are, so that when Santa finally arrives, he can give each of them the best Christmas ever. You mean I get to spend every December with you? Awesome! We got so much to catch up on. I have a ton of new friends. Isla and I are kind of a thing. And, hey, my parents said we're going to stay here for a long time. That's great news. Oh, best friends together again. All right! Blizz, look out! Okay. Yep. Still not great at flying, but working on it. Captioning sponsored by CBS
