[static] [unsettling tone] [exhales] [metal thuds at a distance] [man] We can be here all night long until you talk. I don't care. Where are the bodies at? Help us and we can help you, okay? It can be the difference between a full life in prison or the death penalty. Joe, come on, just talk to us. Where are the bodies? [breaths heavily] [indistinct whisper] [screeching tone] [indistinct chatter on radio] [man grunts] [camera shutter clicking] [detective] Right now, we only have five bodies. [indistinct chatter on radio continues] All seem to have been dead for about a week. [coughs] [flies buzzing] Oddly enough, there's not a single drop of blood around the house. I'm not sure if the victims were killed somewhere else, then brought here. Jesus Christ. [eerie tone] [softly] Shit. Hey, get this one right here. Seems like death of suffocation. [man] Has anybody been in the restroom yet? [detective] I didn't see any bodies, but go ahead and get pictures of all the rooms. Seems there's something in his mouth. [clicks] - [sudden sinister tone] - Jesus! [gagging] [detective] Stay here. - [gagging] - [detective] Ma'am. - Ma'am! - [coughing] It's okay. Where is he? Where is he? [indistinct] [detective] Stay here! [suspenseful tone] [tone intensifies] Shit! [breathing heavily] [softly] Fuck. [shouting] He has a hazmat suit on! [detective] Everyone's hands up now! Put your hands up now! [breathing heavily] Take your head gear off! Take it off! - [switch clicks] - [knife slashes] [man struggling] - [coughs] - [knife slashes] - [man yelps in pain] - [detective] Shit! [eerie tone] [breathing heavily] Fuck! [breathing nervously] [softly] Fuck. - [man screaming] - [howling] [gunshots] [muffled grunting] [echoed laughter] [eerie tone] [spooky music intensifying] [birds chirping] Can you hear me? How's everything sounding? Did you check the XLR cable? Dave, you always got to check the XLR cable, okay? [Dave] Yeah, the cable's fine. It was just the levels. We're good. Okay, do we need to do a sound check? - [Dave] Yeah. - Okay, uh, this is Beth Stewart. We are in Houston, uh, doing our final video project at the absolute last second. Uh, blah, blah, blah. - I'm tired, I'm hungry. I wanna go home. - [Dave] Good. - All right. - Good? Okay, um... - [Beth] All right. - Take one. Action. Are we like triple sure that everything's going... [Dave] Yes. Go, go. Hi, this is Beth Stewart with South Vista College. We're standing outside Houston, Texas, which is said to have one of the largest missing persons' cases in the United States. We are at the exact location where a family went missing 20 years ago. Jack Stern, his wife, and their two children. The only thing left behind at the scene was their car. Not a single drop of blood was found. [Dave] That was good. Let's, uh, cut? How was that? It was good. I think all we need now is B-roll, right? Yeah, let's, let's wrap it up. It's good. Let's go. Let's go! I don't know about this project. It's kind of lame. We can't just go to a spot where people went missing. [John] Um, yes we can. And that's what we're doing. There's nothing lame about a missing family. It's like... I don't know if you've ever been... [crow cawing at a distance] ...friends with somebody that went missing, but I think it's an interesting story. [Val] I wanna do something... - [clattering] - [Val screams] [John] Oh, my God, I... - Val, I'm... - [laughter] [John] You... Uh... You're such a loser, John. He's so innocent. [chuckling] Do you wanna do something scary? [Beth] Yeah. Unique and scary. Okay, I have an idea, but let's grab food, and then let's go... [John] I'll see you in there. Then we can go to my ap... Apartment. What does he mean? - [Beth] Food sounds great. - What does he...? Guys? Hey, guys. [laughs] That... That's not funny. [punches on door] Guys! Help. Oh, fuck. Dave, can you please not film me eating? It's kind of weird. [Dave] We need lots of behind-the-scenes footage for the Blu-ray. [Val] Trust me, no one's buying a student film. [Dave] Nice shoes. You know, speaking of jobs, have you guys had any luck finding one? I've got internships or calls, but I haven't had an actual job. No. Every time I say I'm graduating from South Vista College, they say they've never heard of it. People literally call it the 13th grade. [laughs] - Oh. But how old are you? Twenty-eight. John, how old are you? - Uh, 25. - [Val] Dave? - [Dave] Thirty. - See, I'm 36. It's just a college of misfits. - Nowhere to go. [sighs] Nothing to do, but... - [chuckles] ...literally, we're just in the middle of nowhere filming for missing people. Oh yeah, it's not the easiest industry to get into. Most people that do film end up serving coffee or working as a florist. [Val] Florists make good money. What about you, Dave? [Dave] Well, I did get a call back one time. Um, when I arrived to set, there was a guy wearing a superhero costume, and a naked chick. [chuckles] Are you serious? [Dave] Yup. Did you... You s... You stayed. - [laughing] - Please tell me that you stayed. - [Dave] It was good money. - [both laughing] What was the name of it? Please tell me the name. [Dave] The Incredible Bulk. - [both laughing] - Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. Serious question. - [Dave] Like it? - [Val] You have to answer it. - Are they still hiring? - [both girls giggle hard] [Val] Uh, yeah, just excuse the mess, like the wall. [Beth] Oh, my God. [chuckles] Val, what the hell is going on here? - Yeah. - [Val] Okay. Yeah. I, I should have mentioned it before you guys got here, but I, I do have this slight obsession with serial killers. Um, to be fair, it did start very... ...like, innocent, you know, true crime and stuff like that. But I, I did end up writing a serial killer. [Val] So... [sighs] - [John] You wrote a serial killer. Cool. [Val] No, like... [exhales] you know... I wrote some serial killers, just to put 'em out there. - [John] That's better. - Yeah. Um, but... [Beth] You're like the last person on Earth - I ever thought would be into this. - [Val] No... I know, but, like, look at all the stuff that they send me. They send me, like, this, and they write me so many letters and they're so nice. Like, honestly, but... They are! - [Beth giggles] - [blushes] I'm just... They send me this stuff, and I guess they don't have anything better to do. - [Beth] Ah... - [Val] Yeah. - [Beth] But prison. - [Val giggles] I did want to show you guys that I joined this, like, secret online group. It's like a community of people like me. [John] A community of serial killer lovers. No, like morbid curiosity lovers. - Don't be ridiculous, come on. - Show us. Okay. Okay. Uh, we use these, um... ...like, off the grid message boards, if that makes sense. [John] The dark web? I, I'm not ridiculous. No, they, it's... [sighs] It's like an anonymous chat, but there has been this chat that's been going crazy for like weeks... - [Beth] Mm-hmm. - ...and it's this. It's, like, this urban legend of this serial killer guy who went and killed, like, 200 people over the last 20 years. Apparently, he would... ...kidnap them and then take them into his farm. It's, like, in the middle of nowhere, and he'd kill 'em. But that's not even the craziest part. The cra... Like, he would actually broadcast these weird videos of their bodies. I don't know, like, I guess over an antenna television or something like that. But they did call him Mr. Creep. - Sounds like creepy noodles bullshit. - [chuckles] - Okay, I'm just... - Yeah. You couldn't hide a serial killer that killed 200 people from the public. I'm just telling you what I read, because... - [sighs] Okay. - [John] Yeah, it's all BS. It... [giggles] It's not BS. You... Do you guys wanna see one of the videos? Apparently one of the broadcasts were actually recorded. [Beth sighs heavily] - Yeah, whatever. - Okay. - Okay. - [John] I can't wait. Creepy dolls? Check. Scary clowns? A mysterious broadcast signal sending out weird videos? Double check. Today, I bring you an insanely creepy urban legend that's been flooding the deep spaces of the Internet. The story of Mr. Creep. The story claims a mass murderer who wore an old clown mask, and went around kidnapping people, then taking them to a secret hideout in the middle of nowhere where he would murder them. The city kept the killer a secret in order not to cause a panic. He was said to broadcast weird videos with the dead bodies of victims. Some say the broadcast is still sending out signals to this day, but it hasn't been found. Only one recording of a broadcast exists today, and we're gonna show it to you... ...right now. [unsettling tone] [crackling] [man speaking unintelligibly] I, uh... [relaxed music] [woman-like male voice] I come home after working a 12-hour shift... ...I cook dinner, and all I get is a mouthful of insults. [audience laugh track playing] [ceramic clatters] [woman-like male voice] Oh. What was that? Oh. Oh, you don't, you don't like fish heads? Hmm. Well, little Johnny... ...he likes fish heads. You know why? Because Johnny's a good boy. Yeah. Unlike his siblings. Worthless... [distorted] ...leeches. - [audience laugh track playing] - [woman-like male voice] Oh. What was that? What was that, dear? Did... Did you wanna say something? No. What did you say to me? - [yelling] What did you say to me? - [cutlery clatters] [audience laugh and clap track playing] [woman-like male voice] You will eat! [thud] [audience laugh track playing] [sighs] That's it. [John] Christ, Val. And you wrote to this guy? No, I wish. He died years after he was caught, but if he was alive, of course, I would. [Beth] Why? I don't know, he just... Like, I know he was messed up, and I don't know why, because, like, it sounds crazy, but I feel like I could have helped him. - [Beth] Yeah, that's messed up. - Uh, okay... [mumbling] [John] They said that the broadcast was still running, right? People claim it is. Well, then all we would need is an antenna and an old TV, and we could keep this thing going, right? [chuckles] Does anyone even have one of those? - [Dave] I have one. - Can we use it? Yeah. We just need an antenna. [eerie tone] [bizarre tone] - ...watching Channel 99... - [scoffs] [laughs] Most kids learned their sex basics from Channel 99. [Val] 100% of it. Where's the power? Okay. Cool. [Val] Jesus. We're gonna get channels from, like, China with that thing. - I hope so. - [Val] Definitely China with that thing. [Beth] Hmm. [clears throat] [John] All right. I think everything is set up. Let's see how this looks. [static] [Dave] Uh, I think you have to... What is it? The channel scan. You gotta do the channel scan. [unsettling tone] - [Val] Damn. - I guess that settles it. I guess, um... - Well... - Just Internet clickbait. I'll just return this. - I guess... - [Val] Wait, wait, wait. - [static increases] - [John] What? [Beth] I saw it too. [Val] [inaudible] Don't you see? [male voice speaking unintelligibly] [male voice speaking unintelligibly continues] [switches off] -Dammit, it... I just bought this thing. [Val] Check the plug. It... It was plugged in. - [Val] I mean, the antenna looks fine, but... - [John sighs heavily] - [object clatters] - [John] Nice, Dave. - Um, anything? - [Val] No. - Guys, we have to dig deeper into this. - [John] All right... There's history here, it's real, I know it. [Beth] And do what? There's, like, no info on this guy. We wouldn't even know where to start looking. [Dave] The abandoned police station. Wouldn't they take all their files with them when they left? No. It's just like abandoned hospitals. Like, when state funding goes, like, everyone just walks out, and they leave everything. Even patient files. Okay, well, we're not gonna break into an abandoned police station - for a school project. - [Val] But forget about the school project. This is something bigger. We could discover, like, the new Ted Bundy that the world never discovered. Exactly. We, we could make a real documentary with this. I mean, this would help our career way more than an associate's degree - from a community college. - That we're never gonna use. - [John quietly] Fine. - [Dave] I'm sold. Because, honestly, we don't have any other job offers right now. Why don't we just take a day, think about it, and then come back tomorrow, and we can talk about your little mystery mission. But let's just go tonight. My adrenaline's running. Why wait? Yeah, I agree. I mean, I know none of us have jobs. - [John] I have a job. - [Beth laughs] [Val] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [eerie tone] [man] Do you hear voices? [exhales] Yes. What do they say? "Cool... [sighs] ...to kill people." [paper rustling] Any certain people? [sighs] [Joe] Anyone. [man] Okay. And who do the voices come from? A floating head. [chuckles lightly] A floating head? Yes. [sinister tone] I mean, I really hope something happens. - I'm really looking forward to it. - [Beth] You do? - I do. - [Beth laughs] [John] Okay, I'm not gonna park in the front. - This is... - [Beth speaks inaudibly] ...pretty shady, so I'm gonna go to the side. [keys jangling] [Beth] This is good. [John] Okay, so what's the plan here? [Beth] Well, Dave knows the layout. [John] You do? [Dave] Well, not really, but... [John] Okay, perfect. I'll tell you what, I'm gonna stay in the car, and keep a watch, because trespassing is no joke. You guys go check it out, and I'll keep it warm for you. - [Beth] All right, Val, Dave... [sighs] Let's go. - [Val] All right. [crickets chirping] Watch out for the spiders. [Beth] Oh, my God. [softly] That's creepy, okay. Let's just get in, get out. Do this fast. [Val] Oh, my gosh. - [Beth] Oh, f... - [clattering] [Val] Fuck. Just jimmy it. - [shaking door] - [Beth sighs wearily] [metal clanging] [Val speaks unintelligibly] [ominous tone] [Val] What are we supposed to be looking for? [Beth] Files, pictures. [breaths heavily] I don't know. What was this place, a museum? [Val] What the h...? Is somebody living here? Whoa. - [Val] Beth. Beth. - [Beth] Val. - [Val] Holy shit. - [Beth] Oh, my God. Okay. - [chuckles nervously] - [Val] They left everything. [Beth] Um, what are we looking for? Do you know his name? I know that he wore a creepy clown mask, and went by the name Mr. Creep, but no, I don't know his name. [Beth] Okay, just everyone start digging through stuff. [Val] I'm gonna look upstairs. [objects clattering] [Val] Oh, my God. Whoa. This must be the holding area. [whispering] What the fuck? What the hell? [jingles] Gross. [jingles] What? [jingling at a distance] Beth? Beth. [door shuts] [nervously] No! Beth! Please, please, no! Please! [Dave] Anything? [Beth] There's a door here. [ominous tone continues] That might be it. [exhales] This has to be it. Let's go. Val. - Where's Val? - I don't know. She was just here. [Beth] Val! Val. [Beth breathing heavily] [metal screeching] [Val] Help! Beth! [menacing tone] - [jingling] - [Val] Beth! - [sinister tone] - [screams] [Val screaming at a distance] [Beth] Val. - [Beth] No. - [Val] Beth! - [Beth] Oh, my God. - [Val sobbing] [Val speaking unintelligibly] - [Beth] Val. - [Val sobbing] - [Beth] Val! - [Val continues sobbing in fear] [Beth] Val! Where are you? Oh, my God! Dave, she's in here! It's, uh... It's... It's locked. - [Dave] Lift... Lift the lever. - [Beth] What? Hold on, let me put this down. [metal clanking] [sliding] - [Beth] Val. - [Val] Let's go, come on, let's go! Come on, we gotta go. Get up, get up! [nervously gasps] [Dave] They've turned on the lights. Shit, someone's here. [Beth panting] [suspenseful music] [clattering] [Beth] Shit. Oh, my God. [Dave] Let's go. Let's go! [Beth] Wait. [Val begins to whine] [Val sobbing and speaking unintelligibly] [Beth] Where the fuck is John? - John! - [Val sobbing] [Beth] What are you doing? Hurry up! [Val sobbing] Get in the car, get in the car! Hurry up, hurry up. Let's go, let's go! We need to go! [door closes] - [Val] Go, please, go, please, go. [Beth speaking unintelligibly] - [Val breathing heavily] - [Beth] It's okay. It's okay, it's okay, calm down. [inaudible] It's okay, it's okay. Hey, hey. - What did you see? - I saw him. - Saw whom? - I saw him, saw him. - It was Mr. Creep. - [John] Oh, come on. [Beth] John, screw you. You had one job back there. - Why were you even in the building? - [John] I went in there to look for you guys! You were gone for, like, 20 minutes. Just give her some space. Val, calm down, calm down, it's okay. - Did you see him? - He's real. - He's real. He's there. He's real. - [Beth inaudible] [inaudible] It's okay. You just... You just calm down. [inaudible] I saw Mr. Creep. He's real. I saw him. - No, he's real. He's real. - [inaudible] [unsettling tone] [John] So nobody's heard from Val? I texted her that we were meeting here at 9:00, and she replied with a smiley face, so I assume she got it. [clicks tongue] Okay. [inhales] Let's start this. [Beth] All right. [exhales]. Okay. [clicks tongue] This is most of what we found at the old police station. We have some old DV tapes, some pictures from the crime scenes, and these VHS tapes. And from what we read, he died from lethal injection back in 2002. And I guess his calling card was filming victims in weird, doing weird things, and he would broadcast those. So, uh... [exhales] Luckily, Dave had a DV camera, so we can see what's on these tapes. [John] Here we go. - [switch clicks] - [static from TV] [rumbling] [ominous tone] [man] We know there's more than the 20 bodies that we found. We've estimated the number to be around 200. Does that number sound right, Joe? Two hundred innocent mothers, fathers, and children. Even your own son. [clicks tongue] My son... ...was a required sacrifice. Required of who? [sighs heavily] God. God told you to do this? Yes. Why? [exhales] I was to kill my son... ...to prove my loyalty. After that... ...I was to kill 200 people. Then... [sighs] I was to kill my family... ...my entire family, and then kill myself... [inhales] ...and I would become God. I see. Does God talk to you every day? [Joe chuckles] He's talking to me right now. What is he saying? He's got a new list for me. A new list of people to kill. And who's that? Beth. [unsettling tone] - What did he say? - I don't know. Nothing. Did he say "Beth"? - [John] No. - [Beth] He said, "Beth." - [John exhales] - Let me rewind it. [DV switches] [tape rewinding] [Beth] It's gone. The video's gone. [Dave] It's a really old tape. Try another one. [Beth exhales] [John] Okay. Here. Try this one. [shuts DV player] [static] ["The Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss II] [Beth] That's enough tapes for today. - [John] Have you guys gone through all this stuff yet? - [Beth] Okay. [Dave] No. [Beth sighs heavily] [John] Looks like he had a pen pal. [Beth] That's an address not too far from here. You're not thinking of going there. She could have some real information on this guy. We're still waiting to hear back from Val. Let me see. - [John] She gotten back to you? - [Beth] No, nothing. Let's just go. [exhales] [unsettling tone] [water pouring] [ceramic vessels clattering] [Mary] I was very surprised when you called. It's been years since I was so deep into that story, everything going on. I even had a book about him ready for release... ...but the FBI wouldn't let me release it without giving me trouble. So it was true? The town was covering up this serial killer. Oh, yeah. [gasps] I believe it was very political. No mayor wants a serial killer on their books who's killed 200 people. But there's a more interesting story under all that. - [John] Like what? - [Mary] Joe. Joe Yates. That was his name. Just normal family man with a boring job... ...had a terrible childhood. [Beth] How so? [Mary] Well, his parents were pretty cruel. They wouldn't let him have any friends, wouldn't even let him leave the house. Sometimes, they took turns beating him... ...and then one day... ...the parents just vanished. Lots of people had rough childhoods, myself included, and we didn't end up as mass murderers. He was... Were you starved? Beaten with a stick covered with thorns? Force-fed bleach? [inhales] Locked in pitch-black closets for weeks? [Beth] And what about his face? Why did he have that... - Like, clown...? - [Mary] Like a clown? Like a clown. [sighs deeply] He wore the clown mask as a kid to escape from the real world, I suppose. His mother saw how much he loved it... ...so she burned it while he was still wearing it. - [softly] Wow. - [Mary] The doctors tried to take it off... ...but it'd already fused to his face. How do you know so much about him? [Mary] I've met with him... ...many, many times at the prison. He trusted me. To many, he was a murderer, a killer... ...but to me... I believe... ...most monsters are not born. They're made by evil parents. [sniffs and clicks tongue] And you two... ...with that camera and everything, wh... What story are you hoping to tell? We just wanna tell the truth. We think the people of this town should know what really happened. Especially the people that still have loved ones that went missing, you know. They deserve answers. Oh, yes, answers. [chuckles] Well... [inhales deeply] If the truth is what you seek, you came to the right place. I wanna give you something before you leave. The manuscript to the book I was going to release. It has every detail I could collect from Joe. That would be amazing. - Thank you so much. - [Mary] No problem. No point in wasting a book. Give me a minute, and I'll go dig it up. [Beth] Thank you. Yeah, I'm getting some major serial killer sympathy from her. This is pretty nasty. [thuds] It's a nice place though. [Dave] John! [all clamoring] - [John] Beth. - [Mary] Evil! [grunts] -[Mary screaming] He's a good man! [body thuds] [Dave breathing nervously] [Beth] What do we do? What do we do? [John] No, not we, you. You hit her with a cane. [Beth] T... Trying to save you! [Mary laughing wickedly] [John] What the fuck? - [Dave] Go. - [Mary continues to cackle] Let's go! [Dave panting] [car engine starts] -[Beth] What the fuck? Go, go, go! [suspenseful music] [car revving] [man] What's with the doll? [sighs heavily] It's not a doll. It's a... ...relic. Where did you find it? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It, uh, it... ...found me. [car door opens] - [door shuts] - [Beth] Here. - Take off the Band-Aid. - [John] Yeah. - [Beth hisses] It looks like it's gonna need stitches. - [John] Okay. [John] Well, just put something on. It's fine. - The hell was that back there? - [Beth sighs] I don't know anymore. It's just... I mean, we just saw a knife go through an old lady. - [Beth] I... - Was I the only one that saw that? [Beth] No, but she was... She was standing there. [panting] [John] I mean, don't be stupid. You saw her get up. [Beth] What do you want me to do? Did you try Val again? [breaths trembling] [Beth] Anything? [stutters] Voicemail. I don't know. [Beth] Let's just go straight over there. [keys jangle] [car engine starts] [unsettling tone] [crickets chirping] [airplane passing overhead] [Val exclaims nervously] [breathing heavily] [exclaims nervously] [sniffles] [flies buzzing] [sobbing] - [yells] Oh, my God! - [wood clatters] [whining] He's here, he's here. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my... [sobbing] Ah! Oh, oh, my God! He's here, he's here, he's here. Oh, my God. He's here, he's... - Oh, my fucking God, fucking mother! - [jingling] Oh, my God! He... [breathing nervously] [Beth] Val, open up. We need to talk. [John] Try the... Yeah. Okay, hold on. Hold on a second. [grunts] I think we got it. [Beth] What the hell has she been doing? It looks like she's been trying to find out where the broadcast is coming from. [dramatic tone] [John] She's got a software to track the signal. [Beth] Let me see. - Here. - [John] It's like 30 minutes away. [Beth] Do you think she went there? [John] Her car's not here. [Beth] Fuck. We shouldn't have left her alone. I knew she wasn't okay. - We have to go find her. - [John] Now? Yes, now! We have to find her, - and keep this going. - Keep what going? This stupid video? Val is missing. We need to call the cops. Call the cops? They won't do anything for 48 hours, and then what? We tell 'em, we killed an old lady, and she came back to life? - No, you killed an old lady. - I... Val is fine. We need to find her, and keep filming everything. [scoffs] For what? Look, I know it sounds crazy, but when, when this is all over, and Val is safe, we are going to have film history on our hands. [clicks tongue] I think you guys have lost your fucking minds. Now, if you wanna go running through the woods, be my guest. But I'm done with this shit. I'm not doing it anymore. [Val whimpering] [sobbing] He's always gonna be there. He's always gonna be there. He's... He's always gonna find... [coughing] No... [sobbing] [softly] I don't know... [softly] I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. [sobbing] He's gonna... He... He's gonna... He... He don't... [mumbling unintelligibly] [softly] I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. He's gonna find me. He's gonna... [sobbing] [softly] I don't know. [creaking] [latches] [breathing nervously] [static] [Beth] John. We need to go now. Okay. We don't know who or what is out there. Our main goal is to find Val and bring her back. Each of us is going to have a video camera and a flashlight, so that we can see what we're filming. Uh, John, did you check Google Maps? Uh, yeah, but it was too hard to make anything out. It's mostly covered by trees. Okay, when we get there, we're gonna split up into three. And I brought these, just... If you find something, if you need help, just give it a blow, and we should be able to hear it from up to half a mile away. - [whistles] - Dave. [John] It works. [exhales] All right. What happens if we see him? [Beth] Then we run. [eerie tone] [seatbelt unlatches] [door shuts] [car door opens] [car door shuts] [Beth] Just keep driving. I'm so scared. What the f...? [John quietly] It is him. [John speaks indistinctly] [starts engine] [engine dies] [Beth] What the f...? [engine cranking] - [John] I, I can't. - John, turn on the lights! - Turn on the fucking lights! - [John] I can't! [dramatic music] - [John] Let's get out! - [Beth screaming] [Beth] Oh, my God! [screams] [screaming and sobbing uncontrollably] [panting] Val! Val! [panting] [softly] Okay, I got my whistle. - [blows] - [whistle malfunctions] - [blows harder] - [whistle malfunctions] Fuck! Are you kidding me? Fuck. [yells] John! [John panting] Beth! Beth! I... I don't see her anywhere. Where should we go? Should we ju... I thought we parked around here. [Dave] Are you sure this is it? [John panting] I s... What, what if this, what if this was Val? The whole thing is... What if it was Val? [Dave] No man, she wouldn't do that. [breathless] From day one, she's been leading us on this thing. She's the one who knew about the murder. She's the one who showed us the video. She's the one who had the location. We're the ones who followed her. Now we can't find the fucking car. [whistle at a distance] Is that Beth? [whistling continues] Beth! - Beth! - [Dave] John, wait. Come on, man, wait up. John! [ominous tone] - John! - [dogs barking at a distance] [Beth panting] Oh, my God. Dave! - Dave, what happened? Where's John? - I don't know. He tried to come find you after he heard your whistle. My whistle? It's broken. It doesn't work. [softly] God. Let's just keep going. We need to go up this river, and the farm should be right there. [Dave] No, Beth, I think we need to find John, and then get out of here. It's okay, John's fine. We just need to stick together. What is that? - [Dave] Oh, my God. - Is that a body? Oh, my God. [sniffles] [exclaims] Yeah. Okay. [man] And the bodies, where did you put the bodies? Just give us a location, Joe. Bodies? Yes. Where are they buried? [Joe scoffs slightly] Sacred ground. Joe, come on. The bodies belong to the families. They deserve to rest in peace. Don't you agree? No. Their bodies, their souls... ...belong to me. [suspenseful music] [whistle at a distance] [John panting] [whistling continues] [John] Beth! Beth? [panting] I'm sorry, guys. - [shuts door] - [mumbles unintelligibly] What the fu...? [muffled struggling] [ominous tone] [Beth] Hurry up! [panting] [dogs barking at a distance] [Dave] Oh, God, Beth, no, we need to get out of here. It's a fucking crime scene. [static] Is that Val? - [Beth] She has to be around here somewhere. - Where? - [Beth] In a building! A building nearby! - Okay... [Beth] Val! Val! Oh. [panting] Val! [Beth murmurs to herself] Okay. Val! Oh, my God. What the fuck? Val. Val. Is that you? [person chuckling] [Beth] Val? Hey! - Val. - [chuckling continues] - [sinister tone] - [Beth screaming in fear] [ominous tone] [jingling at a distance] [Dave] Hey, Val. Val! [jingling] Hey, Val. - What is wrong with... - [bones crackling] [gags] [sinister tone] [Beth moans] [sighs] What? Dave? [whispering] What the fuck? What is this? [panting] Help! Somebody! Help me! No, no, no! Help me! Dave! [panting] Dave! Oh, my God. [sobbing] Somebody. Help! Help! [sobbing] [sniffs] [softly] Okay. [crying] Okay. [rustling] My G... Okay. [keys thud] [rustling] [panting] [grunts] [dirt rumbling] [Beth, softly] Oh, my God. [gasps] Okay. [panting] What... What is this? Oh, my God. [whistle at a distance] Dave. Dave! Keep whistling! [whistling continues] - Dave. - [whistling continues] Dave. Whistle. Keep whistling. Dave! [sobbing] Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I... I'll come back for you, okay? I'll come... I'm sorry. I'll come back. [Beth sobbing uncontrollably] I'll come, I'll come. [continues to scream and sob uncontrollably] Thank God. [keys jangling] [crying] Thank God. [panting] - [growls] - [Beth screams] [rumbling tone] [man] I just want you to know you've committed some very serious crimes here. Crimes this country has never seen before. There's a very high chance you'll get the death penalty. Does that worry you? [chuckles lightly] No. Why? God has promised me eternal life. God doesn't help killers. [chuckles] My God is... ...different. And why is that? Oh, I am God. [news channel opening theme] [female newscaster] Crews continue their search for a group of college students in Harris County. Details are still pretty bare, but so far this is what we know. A call came into dispatch around 2:00 p.m. on Saturday when a woman found an abandoned vehicle on the side of the road near Humble, Texas. According to police, Beth Stewart, Val Peterson, John Riddell, and Dave Burke, students at South Vista Community College were filming a school project, and have been missing for almost a week. Police say they believe this was their vehicle, and have found a backpack inside the trunk with their film equipment, flashlights, and, oddly, a doll. Friends of the students say the group was filming a documentary of the rumored murderer, Joe Yates, an internet-fueled story of a psychotic serial killer, who people claim killed hundreds in this area over 20 years ago. Police say there is no connection and that Joe Yates - never... - [male voice]...never exist...
