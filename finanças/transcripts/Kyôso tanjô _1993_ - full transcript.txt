Production: Light Vision, Pony Canyon Cooperation in Planning: Office Kitano Cooperation in Production: Light Vision Entertainment I'll take another one. Leader, please smile! Hey. Those people over there. They're some sort of religious group. Yeah. That old man is the Leader. It would be nice if there were no waves in the sea. Do you not like the sea? Well, it's fine to look at... ...but I'm not comfortable being on top of it. I see, you get sea sick. I, uh, almost drowned and died when I was a kid. I didn't know they came all the way out to the country. It sounds like a scam, doesn't it? I wonder what kind of people join those. Maybe a bad breakup? Seems so fake. Does everyone stoop so low? No, to simply state the reason I joined. You can get the closest to God through it. MANY HAPPY RETURNS Original Novel, "A Guru is Born": Beat Takeshi Masato Hagiwara Koji Tamaki Ittoku Kishibe Beat Takeshi Music by: Naoyuki Fujii Directed by: Toshihiro Tenma Greetings, Ladies and Gentlemen! Today, you will all be witnessing a miracle in front of you! This religious group has... ...gone out of their way, to visit this devout community. Today, the Leader over here... ...will be showing you the results... ...of his years of hard work... ...and hopes to save you all through his power. What are those miracles? The first, to walk on water. Next, he will hold his breath underwater for ten minutes. Then, he will cure many kinds of diseases, all kinds. - Alright then. - Excuse me. - May I? - What is it? Well, you just said that he could cure all diseases. Yes. Is it true? How would it help us to lie? So, are you sure? Is something the matter? Well, my grandmother's right leg has been disabled for a long time. She can't walk. She's always in this wheelchair. Leader, what do you think? Everyone, the Leader has accepted this task. Miss. Your wish will be granted, it has reached God. Ma'am. How wonderful it must be to have such a kind granddaughter. Alright, we'll have them come up. Please, this way. *Chanting an incantation* *Chanting an incantation* I can stand. I can stand! I can walk. I can walk! I can walk, I can walk! - I'm so glad, Grandma! - I can walk! - Thank you so very much! - Thank you so very much! - Thank you! - Thank you! Anyone that has some concerns, or would like to rely on the Leader... ...please write your name, address, and phone number on this sheet of paper. He will certainly solve your problems. Here you go. Many important opportunities are here, there are meetings with celebrities and the Leader in here as well. One is 500 yen. What do you think? Would you like one? Wait! We're going to ride! Stop, stop it. Hisae. Over here, there's an open seat here. Tomoko. Go ahead. Excuse me. That old lady, she's the one that stood up from the wheelchair a little bit ago, right? Yes, that's right. Is she a comrade? Were those people planted in the audience? They weren't planted in the audience. I mean, they were planted in the audience... ...but the Leader healed that old lady previously. And... ...it's not like you can find old ladies like that everywhere... ...so she's helping us. We're thinking about things too, so don't probe for information, okay? *Chanting an incantation* - Thank you! - Thank you! Anyone that has some concerns, or would like to rely on him... ...write your name, address, and phone number on this sheet of paper. He will certainly solve your problems. Many important opportunities are here. There are meetings with celebrities and the Leader in here as well. One is 500 yen. - Would you like one? - Excuse me, I have a wish. - What is it? - Yes. Could the Leader, my back... You want your back to be healed? Alright, he will heal it. However, there isn't much time today. We have to move on to the next spot, sadly. Please, I beg you. Uh, the Leader also went the extra mile just now... ...and he's quite tired. Maybe another time. I'm sorry. I'll do it. Leader. I'll do it! It's healed, huh? Aren't you glad? Why did you do something unnecessary? Huh? What if it doesn't heal? You were healed, too. It healed because I twisted it! Just shut up and do what you're told to. Idiot. You understand now why we plant people in the audience, right? That old man earlier, the Leader gave him the strength to stand himself. He saw the old lady stand... ...and his faith in the Leader's power helped him stand. This old lady was healed by the Leader as well, years ago... ...and she was moved, and decided to join us. Here, take this. Go home. Excuse me. I have a lot of free time. Can I tag along? Mr. Shiba. That kid is asking to come along. He thinks it looks interesting. Mr. Shiba. You won't let him, will you? It's indiscretion. I don't want him to. I'll have to look after him if he does. Let's go then. Komamura, come on, let the kid come. We will be showing you the years... ...of hard work, by our Leader. And he hopes to save you all through his amazing power. The first miracle is, to walk on water. Let's stop, okay? - We don't need to do this. - You don't want one? Okay, let's clean up then. I'm not going to do it anymore. I can't do anything about it. I'll go get Mr. Shiba now. Mr. Shiba, I'm sorry to disturb you while you're resting... ...but the Leader is complaining again. I'll go check on him. I've told you to stop drinking, haven't I? Your hands are going to be shaking during the demonstration. That happens when I'm really motivated, it's not because of the alcohol. Anyhow, bring some people who really need healing. What would you do if I did? I'd heal them with my power, of course. Kazuo. The healing hands really do heal. What we're doing right now, is sadly only perfunctory. - What are you doing? You idiot! - Ouch! - You're just being a tramp! - Woah! Enough! You'll be punished for this. Punished? Say that again! Where is there a God like that? If I'm going to suffer, you would have suffered even more by now. Huh? Is an alcoholic an angel of God? Who's the one that's provided all of this for you with the good food? Idiot, talking about a real healing. You idiot. Got it? Huh? Say it. If you get it, stop bickering and go to sleep. Idiot. You're getting old, It'll be your fault if you just flop over and die now. What are you doing? What do you mean, two v seven? - What do you mean it appeared? - It just appeared. This doesn't even count. It just appeared, what do you expect me to do? - Do you understand that I lost a lot? - I lost a lot too. - You bought some too? - Yeah. 3,000 yen. - And what did you buy? - Three v four. But you told me two v seven! That appeared too, what was I supposed to do? - You must be bored by now. - Huh? Why don't you go home? It looks fun in the beginning... ...but we basically sacrifice everything for the Leader. It's a bittersweet thing. - I want to ask you for a favor. - Huh? Um, the wheelchair and the healing hands. I want to do that. You want to try? This salmon is unusually salty. Why aren't they considerate of old people? Greetings, ladies and gentlemen! - Today, you will all be witnessing... - Hey, kid. -...a miracle in front of you! - You seem pretty nervous, are you okay? Seems like this joke of yours has gotten out of hand? You understand? These things go better with an example. Very well. Here we go! Try standing up. Stand up, you can do it! Kazuo, you can do it! You have to stand firm. It's easy. Why are you taking so long, just stand up. Leader, please do it once more. - I'm very sorry. - Huh? It was great, it was realistic. But you see, humans... ...they only trust what they see. It's not about being good or bad at acting. What's most important is that... ...you were healed, and stood up. That's what. Right? And what you did, that showed the normal people... ...the existence of God, or the power of God. So, for that to happen, it doesn't matter whether... ...we plant people in the audience or if it's fake. - I'll try harder. - Just relax, okay? It is here. This is the head of the household. I'm sorry to show him in his suffering. Honey! Honey! It's the Leader. The Leader came to see you. Ma'am. It's alright. What's his sickness? It's cancer. Cancer. Cancer. I've tried everything, but he is still this way. You are my only hope. Excuse me for a moment. We can't do anything about cancer, he's only going to last a day or two more. The Leader was asked personally. We can't be talking about profit now, let's go. That moron. *Chanting an incantation* *Chanting an incantation* That fool killed him. 'Cause he applied electricity to someone so sick. Huh? Is that why... Hey, stop eating, we're going. The Leader killed the guy here. So let's go. Komamura! - Yes? - We're going. What are you doing with the Leader? Forget him, let's go. Tomoko, we're going. Excuse me. Everyone... ...thank you so much. It's been years since my husband... ...has shown a smile so peaceful. He doesn't feel the pain of terminal cancer anymore. He has been able to peacefully go to heaven. This is all the power of the Leader. Thank you so, so much. The Leader is not a materialistic person at all. Quite rare these days. That's why I think believers follow him like this. That's why we want the Leader to... ...experience at least a normal life, even if it's not luxurious. But if you have a religious group like this... ...many things happen. We really feel guilty of being an inconvenience to him. Wouldn't that not be enough then? Oh, well, these are just determined by how you feel. We don't say how much. So, if it's not impolite, would it be a bit more? We don't care how much, just what you feel is fine. - What I feel? - Yes. Just a moment, please. Yuji! Mom, stop! Just leave me alone. No, I'll have you come home this time. Please. Look at that, Kazuo, it's happening again. Who...? Come on! Yuji! What are you doing? Let go of Yuji! Yuji is my son. Don't interfere with him. Please think of Yuji's feelings, too. Your parents are fine with this, right? Yes, I think so. - You'd better keep it a secret. - Yes. These kind of incidents are the most bothersome for religious groups. It's not like we're kidnapping people, but we're always the bad guys. If something goes wrong, we could be shut down. Excuse me, may I? What do you mean, "May I?" You all are fake and conspiring. I hear you take quite a bit of money. We are not that sort of organization. Is that crackbrain over there who you guys call God? He's a sensitive god, isn't he? Isn't there something you can do about that? - I can speak with you over there. - I don't have anything to talk about. I also have something to give you, over there. I'm sorry! You're cruel! Oh you're cruel! I'm sorry! That's harsh! This is insane! Ouch! Ouch! Too strong! Stop! Mr. Shiba. Do you think God really exists? Well, the god you're talking about... ...what is it like? The kind that heals the sick... ...or the kind that helps those in need. I mean, everyone says stuff like that... ...but really, in history so far,... ...has God ever healed the sick or helped... ...those in need? Everyone expects that, but realistically... ...God hasn't ever shown up and helped like that. Right? So compared to that, our religion... ...has actually healed the sick before... ...and helped disabled people stand. Our religion seems more god-like than God. - Two servings of cow stomach, please. - Alright, two servings of cow stomach. So I'm thinking that God is just something that people thought up. The number one thing that they thought up. I don't know if god exists or not. It's okay if you stay in our religious group... ...and we'll provide for food... ...and a place to stay, but nothing more. This as well. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me, sorry, excuse me. The traditional fights back then were pretty great. Yes. Leader, I'm worried. Recently... ...Mr. Shiba has been acting strangely. What's going to happen to this religious group? What to do? And I feel... ...that... ...this is not good for you either. No, no, don't worry about me, I just have to endure things. However... ...when I think about the believers... I understand, if you don't mind, should I go talk to Mr. Shiba? - Would you? - Yes. However, make it sound like it was your idea... ...and not mine. If you would... ...say it as your own opinion, I would be grateful. Alright, I understand. Thank you. 25th Lecture for the Commemoration of Prayer for Peace and Spreading of Religion Komamura. Did the Leader put you up to this? No. - It's the Leader, right? - It's my opinion. Komamura, it's your own business to... ...bring up God whenever it's convenient, or have fun with the Leader... ...but it's another thing to be nosy about what I'm doing. Got it? Are we not losing sight of the meaning of human life and how to live? What is important for humans to be happy? It is... ...the heart! You must store treasures of the heart. - Where do these treasures come from? - This won't do, he's really into this. This won't help us make money. You must not place value on possessions. Most importantly, you must store treasures of the heart. In order to... - ...help your heart grow, - Time to change leaders. Who is it? Hey. You got something to talk to me about? Won't you quit for us? We'll give you this money if you do. Take this money, and get out. What are you talking about suddenly, what did I do? You don't listen to us, and act out on your own. Are you confusing yourself with a real Leader? I'm doing my part as the Leader, just like you told me to. No one told you to be a real Leader! We told you to be a fake one, you idiot. We're not going to earn money like this! Don't lie, you're making money aren't you? It's because of me that you have all this. Moron! If you did as you were told, we would have had better, you idiot. All you do is drink. Take this money and get out! Do you guys think, that you can... ...chase me out that easily? Huh? Do you know what would happen if I told the believers? Do you think the believers would stay quiet if... ...their precious Leader is being treated like this? - You bastard! - Ah! - Stop fooling around! - Ouch! - Try telling them! - I get it, I get it! Why don't you try telling them? - Forgive me! Forgive me! - Get out of here! - I get it! - You old man! I get it! What do you mean, 'ouch'? If it hurts, just heal it with your powers. Fool! I'll leave. Shiba. Go. Take care. - Hey! - Yes? Take this. Mr. Shiba said... ...that the Leader running off was so shameful. He's just talking, he's not looking that hard. What do you think is going to happen? Well... ...it's over, because there's no Leader. What do you think everyone else is going to do? It's just goodbyes after this. Is that so? You might scold me for saying this... ...but it was pretty fun. Who should we choose? - For what? - The Leader. It's not that simple. Komamura, listen... ...the most important thing is the teaching, the teaching. It doesn't matter who the Leader is, as long as there's the religion. Who's going to be the Leader, then? What about you? - I'm not qualified. - That doesn't matter. Why don't you do it, Mr. Shiba? Idiot, I couldn't do something in the background like that. What do you mean, background? What do you think they're talking about? Probably about who to make the new Leader. I wonder who it'll be. Maybe Komamura. Is that so? What if it's you? The new Leader is complete. The new Leader will be entering now. Everyone, please bow your heads... ...and welcome him. I would like to... ...celebrate this fine day with all of you today. The wind of the almighty God... ...blows on a Spring Day by his plan. The color does not change, and the flowers bloom. We gather here and welcome the spring. My joy is evident along with God. Congratulations. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. - What about Mr. Shiba? - He went ahead. - Where are we going? - A nice place. A nice place? A nice place, and an even better place. Excuse me. Are you sure that it's alright for me to be the Leader? Well, the Leader is God's speaker, right? It's not the Leader that is almighty, what's important is to spread the teachings. In that case, isn't it better for it to be a young guy, and not an old man? Yup. Better to be young. 1000 believers. It was hard work up to this point. But it should grow from here on out, like a snowball effect. It'll grow if you do as we tell you. Hey, not us, me, me. Huh? - It's me. - Is that so? What do you do for a living? Huh? Our jobs? - What? - Construction workers. He's the site foreman. - What about him? - He sharpens tools. The heart of the guardian god. We believe in one another. By putting our strengths together. Push forward guardian god, the many things between heaven and earth. The path that the guardian god, the many things between heaven and earth shows. You don't talk much, do you? That's not true. It's so nice to have a young guy. It feels like I'm on a date today, I'm so happy. You know how this place is expensive? All I get are old men. Oh, really? Say, shall we do it again? Yes! Blood... Yes. - Alright. Next? - I see. Mr. Shiba. Would Mr. Komamura approve of a message like this? Hm? Anything's fine. You just have to write that God said so at the end. "Religion is a contract with God that you live out..." "...and life's enjoyments..." "...and personal possessions must be given up." "However, because this is not possible for the average person..." "...our religious group exists." This is good! "Religion does not support life financially." If you write that it doesn't support life financially so clearly... ...we're not going to get money for healings anymore. I thought that the healing hand didn't financially help people... ...but rather gave them the emotional support, and helped them heal? You're studying hard. Mr. Shiba, it's your business to enjoy that... ...but, please, stop forcefully bringing the Leader around when he's still new at it. It's not forcefully. He said he wanted to go, so I took him. If that wasn't the case, he wouldn't do it three times. It's not about how many times. Kazuo is still training to be the Leader. I'm saying it's wrong for someone in training to be doing that. Is the training you're talking about, holding back? I'm saying it's wrong to buy love with money. The Leader is not buying love. He did it because he wanted to. He likes sex, so he did it! Is it about time? Yes, who's first? - Mrs. Ogawa. - Mrs. Ogawa? Tell her to wait a minute. Here's the thing, Mrs. Ogawa always comes because of her husband's affairs. So, don't really mention it explicitly. All she does is cry and scream. She'll say that living is hard. What's important is... ...to say something like, "Ma'am, you've already forgiven him in your heart." "Your tears have washed away all sins," or something. Just say random things, they'll do whatever. You know those advice stations on the radio? Just think of it as that, don't stress about it, you'll do great. It's... It's a different, young woman again. I said that this time I'll leave him for sure! I'll leave! Ayano's still three... ...and the younger one just turned one. - I don't know what I'm going to do on my own! - About us... ...you haven't told anyone, right? - Don't tell anyone, okay? - I just want to die! I don't know what to do anymore! - Mr. Shiba. - Huh? Sit down. What is it? Um... ...I thought about practicing asceticism. What are you going to do for that? Fasting, or being hit by a waterfall. Did Komamura say something again? No, this is my idea. I'm not very confident. You know, practicing asceticism isn't going to help you. It's different if you're going to think about it as an event, or a ceremony. I don't want it to be a big deal like that. Sure, if you want to do it, sure. Yes. Hey Leader, are there two numbers that come to mind... ...with the numbers one through eight? One through eight. Three and six, I guess. Three and six? Gold mountain... Hm. - I like it! It's great! - Huh? Great job with your previous performance. Everyone, the Leader is growing in heart daily. I'm sure he will succeed in fasting next, as well! He shall achieve it. Is a room as big as this okay? Huh? It's almost too small. You know how many believers we have. It is for the event for the new Leader. We need to have a full house with a few people standing. It seems that he's taking his practice of asceticism very seriously. Hm. That kid has some pretty serious sides to him, unexpectedly. The believers love him. He does what we tell him to as well, seems like we were lucky. Everything will be fine, as long as we do the dirty work, right? You say that we're the dirty ones, but isn't this taking too much food? Did I order too much? You're going to be punished for that. Hey. You're working hard. Here we go. Kazuo, we're going to build a head temple. We bought 28,000 tsubo of land at the bottom of Mt. Yatsugatake. Isn't that great? Let's build a head temple, huh? Here, a present. Are you alright? - Mr. Shiba. - Huh? What is that? Food. He's fasting, what are you thinking? We don't know if he wants to eat or not. Hey. What's the point of being so serious about all this? If you can become a god with two weeks of fasting... ...everyone who's gotten lost in the forest would be gods by now. That's why he's practicing asceticism. - Mr. Shiba. - Huh? I'll be fine. I'll try for a little longer. Okay. Don't work too hard, okay? He's finally done it. Yes. I wonder why everyone becomes so serious when they become the Leader. It's pretty large, isn't it? 28,000 tsubo. Area of land: 92,400 square meters. Area of structure: 2,480 square meters. A head temple in the style of a shrine, with the monument of the guardian god in the center. When this is completed, we're no small religious group any more. Indeed. The Leader has grown twice as much since practicing his asceticism. From now on, I want Komamura and the young ones to work together... ...to build up the Leader, and achieve our dream. Yes! Where's Komamura? He's cleaning the main room of the temple. Have these been sent out? Yes, all of them yesterday. - Komamura. - Yes? Listen here. What's this newsletter? Did you write it? Yes. Why did you do this without permission? You seemed busy. That's no excuse! I check it every time, don't I? What's this article? Huh? I told you to listen! Why did you do this? Hey! Yes, sir. Since when are you the Leader? Huh? Look at this article, what is this? "Studying the teachings and understanding them further is more important than gathering money." Stop fooling around! Hey. "It is not possible for money to solve everything." So how are we going to build the head temple? How are we going to get the money? Stop fooling around! - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, Leader. Good morning. I'm sorry to be dressed like this. Grandma's knee has been acting up again. It's only standing up and sitting down that is hard. It's not a big deal. But, I wouldn't be able to demonstrate... ...the healing hand and the wheelchair like this. I'm so sorry. It was my joy to be useful. I was looking forward to it. Your healing hand. Thank you. Um... ...should we try the healing hand? Please, let me try. Yes. Alright, shall I bring the tools for the healing, then? No, it's alright, I won't be using them. Alright now. Shall we try standing up? Does it hurt? No. Can you walk? Yes. The teachings of the many things between heaven and earth, the heart of the guardian god. We believe in one another by putting our strengths together. Push forward guardian god, the many things between heaven and earth. I had 500 made, just in case. - I see. - Yes. - How much is it? - 1,700 yen. - 1,700 yen? - Yes. How much do you want to make it? Mr. Shiba, can I talk to you for a moment? What are you thinking, getting a hold on Tomoko? Why are you saying stupid things? I heard from Tomoko. You're listening to a kid. For sure, you haven't done anything? Aren't I saying that I haven't done anything? Alright then, I'll get Tomoko. How far do you need to act stupidly to be satisfied? - Nothing happened, right? - Nothing happened. I'm asking you. I told you already, right? I'm asking you to not do something like that! I said nothing happened, idiot! Hurry up and do it, what's taking you so long? Hey, how much are you going to sell these for? I'm thinking 50,000 or 100,000 yen. If someone wants to buy it for more, that would be fine too. Isn't that a bit too expensive? Shut up. Be quiet and do as you're told. Mr. Shiba, may I? - What? - Please, for a moment. Is everything about financial profit? Everyone said they wanted it, so I made it. So it costs 50,000 or 100,000 yen if you make something at the town factory... ...put it in a flashy bag, then stick it inside of a wooden box? There are lots of people that want it even for 1,000,000 or 10,000,000 yen. 50,000 or 100,000 yen is a fair amount. Do you want to try setting the price? Try selling something like that for 500 yen. No one will want it! Mr. Shiba, are you mocking the believers? You're just using God whenever convenient, and rushing to earn some money. Stop talking like a kid. It's normal for religions to gain money from its believers! You're just smooth talking... ...and using the believers like that! It's the same with Yoko. The previous Leader helped her and let her join us, and you just use her worries. Don't joke around! Listen, that is what you do to save a woman! You try saving them too! Huh? Try embracing Yoko! Moron. You can't say one sensible thing. Using god and religion to this extent, you're a piece of trash. You piece of crap! You'll be punished for this. I'd like to. You're going to hell. Let's see it happen. Leader. You should expel him. I... ...cannot endure this any longer. Mr. Shiba is also trying his best. If we let Shiba go on like this any longer... ...our religion will be destroyed for sure. Leader, you are not in the background anymore. I... ...with my everything... ...will protect you. Please, expel Shiba. Me expelling someone. I cannot do that. Mr. Komamura. Me being the Leader... ...isn't that the most unreasonable thing? Starting at 12 o'clock, there will be a rehearsal in front of the music stronghold. At 1 o'clock, we'll have each group do a final check. Please, get to the place you're assigned. There are cases where the believers arrive earlier than scheduled. In this case, we'll open the house earlier than scheduled, so respond calmly. And, please be mindful of the elderly... Excuse me, Mr. Komamura is... What are you doing? Shut up! You have the nerve to do this! I heard that you said I was a pervert. You're just as bad, getting fooled by me and doing this. You're much more of a pervert! What do you mean? That's so dirty. Using people like that. The dirty one is you! You don't need to go all the way to do this! What kind of religion is this? Stop talking about religion! You did what you did! Saying all these pretty things, you freak! - Is doing this fun to you? - This? You're the one who did it! Mr. Shiba, let's stop this, okay? Let's stop. You be quiet. Hey, Komamura! You say what you want, but if there's a woman, you're doing it! Huh? Leader. It's wrong for someone like me who works for God to do something stupid like this. I will be punished. I won't give excuses. What punishment, you idiot? Who's going to punish you? Listen, don't use God when it's convenient for you! You're fired! Get out of here! Komamura, don't do anything stupid, please don't. Komamura, does someone who works for God... ...embrace women, or stab others, huh? Try stabbing me. Try stabbing me, you idiot! You piece of trash. Listen! Hey! Kazuo, I stabbed Komamura. Can we do something about this? Mr. Shiba, this is the punishment. You say there's no God, and have just been chasing after money. You just killed Mr. Komamura. That's your punishment. There is a God. I guess that means I'm finally seeing God's shadow. Is this the only way that you are able to see God? Kazuo, I wonder when you changed. Leader. How about I look after the group, now that Shiba is gone? I mean, the one that was actually leading the group was me all this time. Leave it to me. Kazuo, so many of them are gone. This will make us a fortune. If we do this a few times, we'll be rich. If I talk like this, maybe I'll be punished like Shiba? Even a punishment wouldn't do for a person like you. What are you saying, Kazuo? Don't talk back to me, the Leader. You're getting confused. Shiba and I only created the Leader for our convenience, and built him up. You just have to do what I say. If you don't want to do that, you can quit. You can't kick me out like you did with the previous Leader. You animal! How dare you talk like that to the Leader, a servant of God? Get out! Five Years Later Greetings, ladies and gentlemen! This religious group... ...has gone out of their way, to visit this devout town. Today, the Leader over here... ...will be showing you the results... ...of his years of hard work... ...in hopes to save you all through his power. So, what are the Leader's miraculous powers?
