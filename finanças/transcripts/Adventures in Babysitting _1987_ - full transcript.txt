That's why l'm sleeping here tonight. - l don't think so. - Come on. - Did you get her clothes off yet? - Don't be crude. Get back. You fall in love and suddenly you're a classy guy. - l have not fallen in love. - What's she wearing? - Clothes. Now get out. - You got to see the new Playboy. There's this girl in it and she looks exactly like Chris. She's got these humongous... Oh, God...! - Who was at the door? - Stray dog. What? - Are you going to go to college? - Huh? Oh, great! Thanks, mom. - You're going to college? - No. - Thank God. - Calm down. [phone rings] Maybe it's Mike. Hello? Will you accept a collect call from Brenda? - Oh.

Chris! - Brenda, what's wrong? - Oh Chris, l'm in trouble. - You're always in trouble. - No, l'm really in trouble. - I did it. - You spiked her Tab with Drano? No, l ran away from home. You what? - Where are you? - l'm at the bus station downtown. Brenda...! - Look, just don't go anywhere. - l don't have any money. l spent it all on the cab here. - Chris, l need help. - I know. You're in my house! lf l take a cab to the Andersons', could you pay for it? Oh no, that's going to be like $40. l don't have $40. Well, can you pick me up? No, l'm babysitting. I can't call anybody else. My dad doesn't know. He'd kill me if he found out. l'm begging you. lt's really scary here. l've seen three people shoot up, a bald Chinese lady with no pants on, and there's this old guy outside who wants his slippers. Get out of my house! You've just moved! Please hurry up and get here. l've got my mom's car. l can't drive it into the city. Oh, my God. There's a man with a gun. Get me the hell out of here. Look, just hang up and sit down. Don't move. I'll be there in half an hour. Please hurry. l think he's going to kill somebody. Maybe me. Brenda? l don't believe this. l do not. - Who's Mike? He your boyfriend? - Yes. l've got to go downtown. Brad, will you watch Sara? No way. What if the house explodes? The house is not going to explode. You leave him here and it will. l will be gone an hour there and back. That's it. OK? - You guys go steady or what? - What? - Do you? - Yes. Are you two listening to me? My mom is paying you good money to watch me. Brad can watch you. Why would my mom pay you good money for Brad to watch me? Sara... - Why can't we just all go? - Because. - Do you like him a lot? - No. Yes. Well, which is it? Yes. l like him a lot. No, Sara, your parents would die if they found out l took you into town. They'd die if they found out you left me here alone with him. Well, who's going to tell them? - Anybody have to go to the bathroom? - [both] Nope. Come on, let's go. Now, if anybody asks, we went for ice cream. - Road trip? - Jesus! Where are you going? - Downtown. - The city? - Hey, can l go? - No, Daryl. Go home. - Who is this kid? - Stray dog. Daryl Coopersmith. - And you're Chris Parker, right? - Go home. - You must be a great babysitter. - What is he talking about? Mr and Mrs Anderson must really trust you to take little kids into the city. - Alone. - Yeah, isn't it great? lt is so great that l'll get my mom to talk to the Andersons about you. - Then maybe you can babysit for me. - Stop it. And then maybe we can drive off to New York just for kicks. - Chris... - Daryl... - You think? - What am l supposed to do? Get in the car and run him over. - Let him come. - Daryl! Sorry, can't talk. Got to run. Will you just get in the car? All right! Now boys, l swear if you give me any grief over the next 60 minutes l swear to God l'll kill you. Dead. Murdered. Stabbed. - Raped? - l am too old for this crap. 25 miles from home, girl My feet are hurting mighty bad [Daryl] Mike what? - [Chris] Mike what what? - What are we talking about? - What's his last name? - Todwell. - Are you writing a book? - Mike Todwell? - Do you know him? - They go out. He's got a red Camaro, right? Oh gee, Daryl. Are you a gearhead and a sex fiend? A lot of people have Camaros. But do a lot of people have the license plate SO COOL? That's Mike. He's the guy who beat me up for touching his car, which l didn't do. - That was him? - Mike wouldn't do that. - Yes, he would. - He would not. He did. He kicked my ass. Want to see the footprint? [all] No. Look. That's where Thor lives! Thor? All the superheroes live in the city. Spider-Man, Daredevil and Captain America. But Thor's the best. He fights the forces of darkness. Forces of darkness, beware. So the babysitter goes upstairs and the sound keeps getting louder. Scrape, scrape, scrape. The babysitter stops at the kid's room. She reaches for the doorknob. Her hand is trembling, her heart is beating fast. Sweat pours down her face. She opens the door... [gasps] and the kids are safely in their beds. l'd like to be safely in her bed. - What are you guys doing back there? - Uh, um... Nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing. Really. That was my dad's, stupid. You shouldn't have brought it along, stupid. - So what happens? - OK. But when the babysitter looks more closely at the kids, she sees that - they don't have any faces! - Oh, my God! - lt's just a pool of mushy goo. - Like Spaghetti-O's? - Spaghetti-O's with meat. - Yuk! The babysitter screams and turns to run, but there's this big giant hairy guy standing right in front of her. He raises his arm, but there's a big metal hook instead of a hand. And the hook goes to her face. Scrape, scrape, scrape! [screams] - Oh, no. - All right! - You got a flat. Pull over. - This is great. To the right, go to the right. - Slowly. Take it easy. - This is not funny. Hold it steady. - Go slow. Pull over. - l'm pulling over. This is great. [Daryl and Sara laugh] [Daryl cackles] Uh... where's the spare? l don't know. Maybe it's on the car. You think? OK. We are going to flag somebody down and we'll go buy a tyre. l've got my chequebook. My purse. Oh, shit! l forgot my purse. l don't have any money. - l don't have my license! - Did you forget your purse? Yes, you little asshole. - She's great. - Wait, l got some money. Here. What, 50 cents? You don't have any money. You're a kid, for Chrissake. Yeah, she's right. You're a kid, for Chrissake. You don't have any money. Why don't you take a walk over there, OK? Right there. [creepy music] Everybody stay behind me. [whistles tune] You kids having some trouble? You got a spare? - No. - Sara...! You went on the expressway without a spare? [guffaws] - We're history. - Ancient history. [all] Aagghh! Just relax. Stay calm. Don't panic. - What do you want? - Just want to help you. Don't listen to him. He just wants to scrape our faces off. What, are you scared of this? You kids must be from the suburbs. [cackles] [starts engine] l suddenly feel like a total idiot. Just stay here, OK? l'll be right back. Listen, l'm really sorry for freaking out back there. - l guess we just overreacted. - That's OK. l'm used to it. Listen, l appreciate this, but... we don't have any money. l'm stuck babysitting for these kids, and... l'm not supposed to be taking them into the city like this. l'll tell you what. l'll tow you to town, to Dawson's garage, and l'll buy you a tyre. My treat, OK? OK? - Oh no, that wouldn't be right. - What would be right? Leaving you kids alone on the expressway? No, l guess not. My name's Chris. Chris Parker. Pruitt. Handsome John Pruitt. - Hey, mister? - Yeah, red. What? How did... how did you... you know... lose it? - Lose what? - Your hand. Was it in 'Nam? Nah, 'fraid not. l was changing a tyre on a big rig and the jack gave out. Back of the truck fell on the hand and popped it right off. Vietnam...! [laughs] What did they do with the hand? Did they bury it? No, l wouldn't let them. - l kept it. - You kept it? l got it in the glove compartment. - Pruitt. - Yo. Dawson here. I just went by your place. - And what did you see? - You won't like it. - What did you see?! - That car was parked in front. - She's with that bastard again. - [horn] Oh, my God!
