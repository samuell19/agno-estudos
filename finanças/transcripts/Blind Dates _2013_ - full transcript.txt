Girls don't play football in Gori. In Tbilisi they do. Manana, give me the poster. The rattle too. Stand next to me Manana is your conductor. It's simple.

I don't think so. I am not drunk. You are not? Good for you. Where have you been so long? - He says nothing. At school. Our girls team had a game. A famous Polish Soccer player was there. A woman? - Yes. Does she look good? I don't like muscular soccer players. Don't mention her in front of me. Marina's son married a Polish woman and she turned out great. Does she play football? No, she is a doctor. A doctor is good. But will he marry a doctor? He just roams around all day. I don't stray. - Yes, you do. I have met a woman today at the stadium. Is she polish? No, she is from Gori. Why do you meet women from Gori? Why is it important where she comes from? It is important. You were from the provinces too when dad married you/ Was that a problem? - Yes it was. I had to teach her everything. It was probably the other way around. I taught you table manners. How to use a fork. No comment. What is this woman doing in the stadium? She wanted to watch the game. What? - She watched the game. She came specially from Gori, to get in and watch girls soccer game? Is she crazy? She wasn't there just for the game. Why then? She came to meet someone. Did she go back? Yes. - Did you accompany her to say goodbye? Yes. - Is she coming back? We will see. Perhaps. And if so, will you see her? Probably. He just says maybe probably. We will see. Do something my son.

Does she bring her friend with her? - Yes. Great. We will have fun. I am not coming. Are you crazy? She's coming for you. I think she fell in love with you. That's why I won't come. Do you think you're better than them? Let's go to Kobuleti. I'm fed up with Tbilisi. What should we do in Kobuleti? The weather is nice there. We breathe fresh air. We can sleep at my uncle's. Dad, can I spend the weekend? Borrow the car? Where do you want to go? - To Kobuleti. Kobuleti in November? Are you sane? Few people, nice weather. Maybe you can even swim. You catch a cold when you eat cold tangerines. If you go swimming now you'll get pneumonia. Don't get involved to the life of a 40 year old. Don't you interfere in our conversation. If you want him to marry leave him in peace. Last year they took my car and broke it while drunk. Uncle Otar, we're not drinking this time. We breathe fresh air and get fit.

Two guys didn't want to give their up without getting my phone number. And what have you done? I gave them my number. Did you know about my jealous man, if they hadn't asked for it. You're married? Yes and no. He is in prison. We have a phone date once a week. Yes, father? - Where are you? Aren't you ashamed? We met friends and got stuck. What friends? - These girls here been waiting for an hour. We're almost there. - Come immediately! Just hear how they sing. Anna, come here, you're getting wet. When are you leaving? - Tomorrow. Too bad. We could have a little can go for a walk. I have a shift tomorrow so I have to leave early. I wish I could stay. We could have gone fishing. I've never been fishing. Long live this place! Bravo! Sweet! Let's go? Have you paid? Goodbye. A beautiful girl waited with her friends for five hours on you and that might have changed your life. But you'd rather roam around and get drunk. We're not drunk. Yes, you are. So tell me, what do you want? What is this behavior? Look at me I'm talking to you. What kind of people are you? Where did you grow up I would really like to know. What is your goal in life? Father, calm down. What do you want to do with your life? I would really like to know. Otar, don't drink. Did you say something You mustn't drink.

Do you have class today - Yes. Am I disrupting? - No. School is great. What school did you go to To night school. In my final year of school I didn't go to classes. Why? I was pregnant with Anna. I've been skipping school all the time. I even had nightmares that the teacher takes me to the blackboard as punishment. What are you doing here, mother? I brought the posters over. Go home. - Are you crazy? Go home. - Anna! I said go home! I hate these posters! Why are you all silent? Who is this? King Erekle. Which one? - Erekle II. Erekle II was one of the most popular Georgian kings. The people loved him. They even gave him a nickname. Do you remember? - Little Kachi. Right. Why little? - He was small. Actually... there is a folk song about this king. I would like to recite it. But I forgot it. Can you refresh my memory? Manana I would like to hear it from you. Our king is called Little Kachi. He donned his armor and tore them to pieces with his bare hands. Thank you. Can I ask you for help again? Who is this? This is my great-grandfather Nikipore. Do you know why his ear is bandaged? Once he ran through the forest, and a beautiful woman called his name. But he couldn't hear her. In the evening they met at a party. And she scolded him for that he hadn't heard her. Nikipore was a hothead and cut cut off his ear with his dagger. He said the ear was useless if he can't hear it. Would you care to cut off your ear for a woman? That depends on the woman. What if I called you? Call me. - Sandro! - What? I don't want you to hear me. OK. Call me again. Sandro! Shall we meet tomorrow? I can't. My husband is out of prison. He was sentenced to four years but he comes out early. He is 36 and was twice in prison. The first time because he stabbed a childhood friend with a fork. He thought the guy would have flirted with me. How did you meet? I went to school. I was 14/ He saw me on the street and I liked him. I liked a lot of guys back then. But after Tengo started to accompany me home and to give presents all other admirers disappeared. Then I got pregnant. Anna was five when he was arrested. He got four years, then he came out. This year he was arrested again. What happened this time? He got into a fight. Do you love him? I used to love him. Now I'm not sure anymore. I'm sick of these problems. He's trying to change but he never succeeds. He's probably unhappy too. I don't know it. I will talk to him. I have never felt so good like with you. Never. I am my whole drive to the sea for life, but I only remember the day that I spent with you I don't care who your husband stabbed with a fork. If you want it, we will be together I'll talk to him myself. But not now. I need time. I'll drive you to prison. Okay. I have to go now. Sandro. Please leave as soon as I get off. Would you like some Khachapuri? No thank you. OK, I'll have something. How much does it cost? - 80 Tetris. Thank you. Is Khachapuri good? Not bad. You see, give me some money. How much does it cost? - 80. Take that. Let's go to the station. We'll see the bus also from here. Sit down. The khachapuri is good. Is this for me? It is beautiful. Do you like it? - Yes. I got the boys inside asked to make it for you. Thank you. As my cellmate saw it, he liked it so much that he let it do it too and asked me to give it to his mother. I'll do everything right this time. Do you believe me or not? What is he doing? Who cares what he does. What is he looking for? He locked himself out. I'll go and help him. Where are you going? I'll help him. Leave him, he'll be fine. What's wrong with you? I'm just helping him. Leave him, he'll do it. He will not. - We'll miss the bus. Calm down, don't stress around. I'm not stressing, come back. I said, you should calm down. To hell. Is it closed, dude? Yes, I left the key inside. Wait a minute. That too, please. Hot Khachapuri. Buy hot Khachapuri! Khachapuri! Damned. Here please. Thank you. - No problem. Are you driving to the town? - Yes. Can you take my wife and me with you? Okay? - OK. Manana, come on. What's happening? - Nothing. Then kiss me. What is wrong? Did not you miss me? It makes me feel uncomfortable. - Why? It's normal for someone fresh out of prison. He's busy driving. Relax yourself. Do you have a cigarette? Thank you. And a lighter? Thank you. Are you a part-time taxi driver? Once in a while . I need a car today. I'll pay you and give you extra money for gas. Where are you going? You just got out? Can't you stay home today? I have to go, it's urgent. What's happening? Why is that important? It's business. I want to know. - Relax yourself. So what are you saying? It's good. Wonderful. I feel sick. What's happening? - I don't know, I need fresh air . Please stop! - We're almost there. I said I'm sick and I need fresh air/ Hold on. - What's wrong with you? I feel sick. I need air. Thank you. Damned. Wait in the yard I'll be right back. Throw the ball here. Ready? Good performance. I have a great daughter! You know how to catch it properly? Don't let it slide out your hands. I'm still falling because of you. Do not worry. Natia! How are you? - Good. Don't you feel cold? Let's get in the car. The sun is shining. Come on! Hi. - Hi. This is my friend Sandro. My pleasure. Sandro, can you please leave us alone, we need to talk? How are you doing? - I'm good. In which month are you? - In the third. Does the family know? Yes. Do they know about me? - No. Does my wife have any idea? No. - Really? - No. Natia, listen to me. I hate talking about it but you have to understand me. I can't take full responsibility for this baby. I will of course help you. I can't do much. I just got out of jail. I have no job and no prospects. Everything is so messed up. What can I say, I hate abortions. But do we have another option? I will not have an abortion. I don't want that. I understand that, but is there an alternative? I don't know but I will not have an abortion. I'll get the money. I'll take you to the best doctor. You're safe, don't worry. I don't want your money - Listen. OK, you don't need money. OK, you don't want to have an abortion. I hate it too but it's the only way. What else do you suggest? I will not do it. Listen to me. Let's go to this address. My sympathies. My sincere condolences. Are you Zaza's mother? - Yes. I'm a friend of Zaza's. I just got out of prison. He had done this for you, and asked me to bring it to you. How kind of you. Many thanks. Call Nuzgar. How is my son? - Uncle Nuzgar. Uncle Nuzgar, Natela is calling you. Thanks, you made so happy. Look how caring my son is. What happened? - Zaza sent me a ring from the prison. This man is his friend. Good day. You were in jail with Zaza? - Yes. When did you come out? - Today. Congratulations - Thank you. Hi. Have a moment to talk about Zaza? Sure. - Please come. What's the matter, Nuzgar? He was in prison with Zaza and came out today. Come in. I'll be right back. Girls, leave us alone for a moment. Because of that called meat? - That's soso. How are you doing? I just got out, enjoying my freedom. Nuzgar, look at that beautiful fish. Something very special. We will serve funeral feast. Look. It's very fresh. He gave me a special price. How much? - First he said 20 lari. But we agreed on 18. As for the catfish, tomorrow we'll get it fresh from the Alasani. The fish is good. - Good, but expensive. We need at least 20 kg, right? - Yes. You can't get it cheaper. Let's talk about that later. The fish seller's waiting for my answer. He'll sell it maybe to someone else. It still seems expensive. The fish alone costs 400. With the catfish... ... it makes it 800. - And off we go. What should we do? Maybe we should buy carp. I'm sorry if I interfere it's none of my business. I think they are coming also with a kind of fish. Why? Zaza needs money in prison. Zaza needs money in prison? For what? He lost at cards. He has to pay today. Zaza played and lost? He's a believer, it can't be that he is playing. He often visits the priest. I know, but he played anyway. I have to visit him in prison. He hasn't played in ages. How could that happen? Go see him. That's why I said yes. I know you're short on cash. Two types of fish are not necessary. One is enough. Besides, we can then think about something else. It's a delicate thing. I saw the coffin at the entrance. And? - It's an expensive coffin. Maybe you could exchange for a cheaper one. What the hell are you talking about?! Let's think about something else. Where's the funeral feast? In a restaurant. How much is this per person? 20 lari. - 20 laris? And we'll bring our wine. 20 lari with your own wine? This is too much . How many people are invited? 250th - 250? Could a table be set up in the courtyard? You have a yard right? Yes. - Over there. Let's see. Let's set up a tent in the yard Who still uses tents today? Why not? The weather is nice. It has a lot of space. We'll bring wooden chairs and benches. Cover them with paper. 400 lari will be enough. I'll get the benches. - Well, then? 250 guests times 20 lari per person, that's 5000. In the yard it would cost only 500. That would save you a lot. You would help Zara and there would be some money left over. Don't tell us what to do. We can manage on our own. Listen brother I won't tell you anything. I'm here to help. If you don't need me, I'll go. OK, don't be mad. He was just stating his opinion. Yes, but it was rude. Your son sent me here. Our family is in a bind! I see that, but do you think my life is rosy? I came out of jail. Here are my discharge papers. I have more important things to do than discussing funeral feasts. I'm only here to help Zaza. It is your decision. Let's help your son. The priest is there to hold the funeral ceremony. I'll be there in a minute. OK. I'm leaving now. Should I come back in an hour? Okay. I'm also trying to get some money for Zaza to scrape together, but without guarantee. See you later. Oh my God. Excuse me. Sorry. Let's stay a bit Thank you. How are you? Why don't you say hello to Sandro? Hi. We have 30 minutes. Please make us beautiful. No thank you. - Come on. She's the best hairdresser in town. Sit down. With him, however, you can't do much. Would you like to wash your hair? No. - Of course he would. You changed the shop here, didn't you? No. Were these photos always here? - Yes. Are you sure? - Yes. Then that's fine. Please don't smoke here. Go to the back. Hello Natia. How are you? I'm glad to see you. I have good news. In an hour I'll have 2000 lari for you. I'm serious. I'm not forcing you to have an abortion. You must also understand my situation. I just got out of prison. But I already have 2000 lari for you. We'll take care of the rest later. Where is the problem? Just calm down, OK? Manana, where's the ashtray? It was somewhere here. Manana, where's the ashtray? What are you doing there? Here's your pay for this week. Don't come back Now get outta here. What are you doing there? Change outside. What's happening? Did something happen? You caress my cleaning lady in my presence! Are you crazy? A few hours outside. What do you want? Are you sane? Nothing happened. Look at me! Nothing happened. Got it? Tengo, please go. - Why should I? Out! - I swear. Listen to me. Come here! - Get out! Do not touch me! Calm down. - Out! Do not touch me! - Calm down. I said don't touch me. I'll hit your head with the iron. Are you crazy? Come on, go ahead. Be quiet. We are not alone. How can you be jealous on a refugee like Natia? Are you really crazy or what? Tengo, leave me alone. Just relax. Let go of my hand. I'll relax when you go out. Are you sure? - Yes. For sure? - Yes. Do not hit me! Then get out! You act like a crazy. - Out! You are really stupid Crazy. Don't sit there. I won't cut your hair. Are you married Sandro No. If you ask me - never marry. Why? I landed in jail because of my wife. I don't know, what to do with this Natia. She is pregnant and doesn't want to abort. What should I do? What about Zaza? He played against Rezo and lost. Do you remember Rezo? Yes. But Rezo has a phone, why didn't he call himself? He has none. You found it and gave him four more years. For unauthorized phone possession, and for gambling. Why did they let you out? You know I'm telling the truth/ I will find out. Listen, Nodar. The prison administration knew everything. That Rezo had a cell phone and was playing. That he forced people to call their families on the phone to ask for money. The guards came and said that they who don't report gambling will get two more years. Everyone was afraid of Rezo and shut up but I was fed up. If you're fed up with Rezo, then why do you care about the money? Also, Zaza has stopped playing. He has become a believer. I really need money right now. And how you will make money? You know I'll pay it back as soon as I can. You know me. I'll talk to you now and you'll disappear. Immediately. You bastard! - Don't touch me! hands off me! Hey you let him go. He is the driver. Go to the car - Let me pass. I said go to the car. Get off him. I'll kill that bastard! Get the other one over there! Take your hands away! - Stand up. Take your hands away! Spread your legs! He's not to blame. Let him go! I am his father, let me explain Wait a second. - He's his father. Let him explain. He was released today from prison. He came to the funeral and said my son has gambling debts. Hold him still, I can't hear anything. Check his papers. He said my son did lost 2000 lari in jail. He said I should give him the money. He came out today. Put him in the car, I'll find out. My father in law died. His grandfather. Please take off his handcuffs. Otherwise his mother will get a heart attack. Her father is dead, the elder son in prison and this one in handcuffs. Let me. Nodar, you are a hero. You saved us - Thank you. We won't forget you. Nodar, thank you. - No problem. We are forever in debt to you. What did you need the money for? For the family? Yes. I have money. I'll bring it to your family. Give it to the guy who came with me. Here, take this. Bye. Sandro. Bring this to Natia. She lives with the refugees. And take whatever I owe you. I don't want the money. Thank you. Hi guys. - Hi. Do you know where Natia lives? Natia who? The thin one working in the beauty salon. What do you want from her? I should give her something. - What? And who are you? - Her brother. What should you give her? Some money. Come along. Gela, is everything OK? - Yes everything is OK. This is my father. Dad, that's... - Sandro. Irodi, sit down. Is Natia here? - Natia is shopping, she'll be back soon. Sit down, Sandro. Dad, stay and listen. What's the matter, son? Dad, this is the father of Natia's child. I hardly know her. I've seen her only twice, for ten minutes. Twice for ten minutes, huh? And you made it to impregnate her? Are you saying that my sister is a whore? We're her family, okay? Think before you speak. Calm down my son. You made her pregnant in ten minutes? Gee, what's up? Tell him you aren't pregnant by me. Gela, what do you want from him? He has responsibility. Take responsibility for your actions. What are you talking about? I don't even know him. What is he doing here? How should I know? You said that Tengo's boyfriend got you pregnant. That's what you said, right? - Yes, but... Did you or didn't you? - Yes. Well, there he is. If he is not, what is he doing here then? Since when do Tengo's friends visit you? And bring money? What is that? Is that all you offer? We are refugees not worth it to you? You sleep with our women I'll tear you to pieces! Come on, go! I said I'll tear you to pieces! Wait. Wait a minute. Aunt please help me! What's going on here? Hold still for a moment. Wait, I'll tell you. Tell me everything. - I'll tell you. She is pregnant by him. What did you say? He got her pregnant. And he doesn't want to marry her. Is she pregnant by him? Yes. Is what I'm hearing true? Aren't you ashamed? You refuse to be a father? Wait, don't interrupt me. Aren't you ashamed? Are you abandoning your child? How can you reject your child and this angel? Be quiet! How can you disown her? Answer me. You should be ashamed of yourself. An expectant father, An honorable man. A real Georgian. A real Georgian don't behave like that. You should conquer mountains for your child. It's right here under your nose and you don't want it? Look into my eyes! We trust you Sandro. Take care of yourselves. Have my blessings, children! God bless you. Don't turn off your phone, Natia. Gee, is everything OK? Yes, everything is okay. Why they hold their hands? That's how women walk around. Hi. - Hi.

Sit down, Lali. It doesn't work. Is it locked? - Probably. Sit down. Hello, I'm calling from the 408. The balcony door does not open. Why do I want to open them? I just want them opened. What do you mean by that, Did you finish? Listen, I'll pay for the room because of the balcony and the view. I don't care. I want the view. I need the view. Find Tamil and send someone. I need the view! Idiots! They say it's cold and they locked the balcony. It doesn't matter, I can see the view anyway. Just describe what you see. It's more interesting that way. What do I see from here? I see the old town of Tbilisi. The city of many balconies. The Kura. It also flows through Gori, right? - Yes. Here it is different. It has more curves.

I'll open it. They said, we have to leave the room. I heard it. Shall we go? - Soon. Hi. Let's talk a little about the noises. Listen to the city and walk. Shall we dance? But we don't have music. Never mind. Are you coming with me? To where? - To Kobuleti. My mother asked me to pick her up. What do you need me for? To keep you awake while driving? Yes. I had a terrible dream. I had a crew of trained blind soccer players. I was strict. What's wrong with you? Are you still depressed? Seems so. Did something happen? Nothing important. - Tell me. A friend of mine was arrested. His girlfriend is pregnant. Which friend? I am your friend. I still have one. We studied together. He'll probably get five years. I feel sorry for his girlfriend. She is pregnant and doesn't know where to go. I took her with me. Is there a woman in your apartment right now? Yes. And she's staying for five years now with you until the guy comes out? Why don't you marry her? She seems ready. I have to tell you something. What's happening? We have a guest A woman - a friend of mine. She's staying with us for a while. Who is she? Just a friend. You would too can thread differently. What do you mean by that? She's just a friend. A friend lives with you for a while. Of such a friendship I have never heard. Do you know her? No. Who are her parents? She is not from Tbilisi. I'm fed up with this from your country girls. By the way, a wise man should marry a provincial girl. Roger that? Why marry? I will not marry her.

Let it be. Do you like football? - Yes. It's a Bundesliga game but I don't recognize the teams. Hamburg and Dortmund. Wow. Do you like German football? No, Italian. Girls like Italian football. handsome guys in shorts, running after a ball. It's not about that. I just like the style. I like the focus on the defense. And what do you like about it? They always play defense. It's always dangerous in front of their goal. It is excited when you see them play. I like that tension. But it's not just the excitement. You score goals too, don't you? Oh yes they do. Pass it! Make a pass! What is he doing there? That's why I don't like German football. What could he have done? - He should have play the ball to the right. Right or left? - Right. You know something about football. Come here for a moment. Just look at him. This boy has problems. Then talk to him. What should I tell him? Does he really betrayed a grieving family? He didn't cheat on her. The son of the family had gambling debts. Without your husband the guy would be in a bind now. He would have problems in prison now. He behaved very bravely. He was attacked by 20 guys but he was fearless and clear-headed. You are a good man. And you will find a good wife. Bring her here too. For a hairstyle. I cut both men as well as women's hair.
