Listen, we have to tell the police who did this and the location of the apartment from which you escaped. Don't you get it? He'll catch me and shred me! ln a week you'll find my body in the dumpster. He won't catch you, we'll look after you. Once you speak to the cops he won't be able to harm you. l wouldn't have escaped, but he brought over his 4 friends. Were you ever fucked by 4 guys at once? Your rectum becomes loose like rubber. Who do you think you are, huh? You idiot. You think you know how the world works? You sit here in your little office... with no one to shit all over you from morning till evening, and you want to calm me down? l... There's something l want to tell you. Eastern Europe 2005 Hello? Are you on your way there? - Yes, it's by the tracks, right? Cross over the tracks and walk on the path till the house. Ok. Franco? You idiot, l told you to never mention names over the phone! Oh, sorry. Talk to me when you get the package. No prob... Piece of shit. Are you lvan? lvan. Here's the merchandise. Check it out. Not a scratch. Don't just stand there and stare. Strip. Shirt, bra, take it all off. Take off the shoulder pads. All the way. Lower the jeans a bit. Show us your body. Lower. Turn around. There. Now back. Hands down. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Wider. Well? All the teeth are intact, so if you use it, don't damage the goods. They'll come take her in two weeks. By the way, there in the bag are some of her clothes and here's her passport. Don't lose it. Without her passport no one will take her. Ok. Well, does it look ok? Go ahead, call the boss, tell him everything is ok. Can l call from yours? l can't make calls. Here. Did you bring her over to that idiot? lt's lvan. Oh. The idiot. ls she by you already? Yes. - And does she look ok to you? She's ok. - Now listen to me. She'llbe by you for two weeks. Don't ruin the merchandise. Talk to me when they take her and l'll write it off your tab. lf you do everything right, you might get a bonus. But if you screw up... You don't want to screw up, right, lvan? No. l don't. Do you understand what you must do? - Yes. Good. Now put Zhura on. - Who? You moron, you're using his phone. Everything ok? - He wants to talk to you. Yes. Yes. l didn't speak with you. l get it. l'm leaving. Don't ruin the merchandise! Sit. Quiet! Quiet. Want to eat? Drink? Come. Daddy! - l'm coming. Did you eat already? What are you reading? "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn". Remind me what it's about. lt's about an American kid and his black friend who's a slave. An American kid... They used to send people to the Gulag for being friends with Americans. What's a Gulag? - Jail. There's also a kid called Tom Sawyer and Mark Twain wrote a book about him too, but we don't have that book in the library at school. Are you back already? - Yes. Want to eat? - l'm not hungry. What's your new job? What? Our homework is to write 7 lines about our daddy's job. l work in a led factory. That won't come out to 7 lines... Don't move! lf you move you could cut yourself. Take it off by yourself. lf l do it, it will hurt more. Hardy appetite. Could l have some water, please? She's taking a shower now. She stinks like a goat after last night. Look after her. lf l can't sellher, l'llhave to add her to your debt. But there's nothing in this apartment, no food or water, no towels, no soap, nothing. So buy some. l'llpay you back. l have no money. lf l did, l wouldn't be talking to you. You loser... l'llsend someone with the groceries. How did you get this job? You think l'd choose this line of work if l had a choice? lt's all because of these fucking cards... l was playing cards with someone. Poker. l bet everything l had and what l didn't have, as well. When he opened, he revealed 4 tens. You know what the odds are of having 4 tens? About as good as... you having a house with a red roof, a garden, two children and a husband who's a lawyer. l stole his deck. lt's marked, l know it. But where the markings are... that l don't know. Never mind. Could you use thinner tape, please? The wide one pulls my hair out, it hurts. This is the deck. Number 9 cards are the weakest, the aces are the strongest. Each player gets 5 cards. When you pick yours up you have to see what kind of hand you got. -What's a "hand"? Maybe you should tell me, what good is poker to a hooker? l'm not a hooker. Maybe today you're not. Tomorrow, believe me, you'll be a hooker. These stupid conversations... Anya is a gifted child, she could get much further than in a regular school. -Yes, l know, but l don't want her to be different from the other kids. Anya's bored in class and has trouble communicating with her classmates. ln the new schoolshe could acquire those skills. Why haven't you spoken to my wife? l did, but she said l should talk to you. Hello? - You idiot... Outgoing calls from your device are blocked due to lack ofpayment. l thought maybe we could play. Want to play, whore? Now l'll teach you how to play. l'll lift my arm and you'll have to guess which one it was. lf you guess correctly, you'll get a surprise. This is to make sure our game remains quiet and cultured. Understand? lf you think l lifted my right arm, put your left hand on your cheek. Understand? Understand? Of course you understand. After all, you're good with games. Go ahead, start guessing. Lift up your hand. Lift it up. On your face! Hand! Now go to sleep. A few slaps never killed anybody. Mommy, it's dark in my room. Mommy! - l'm coming. How are you? What? What? What? Why the hell do you tell her teacher to speak to me?! What? Did you think that if she spoke to me then l'd go to the toilet and shit out the money?! l just thought, with your new job and all, that maybe... You idiot. You idiot! You couldn't even explain to a faggot where the ass is! You must understand that the money l make will be used to pay the debt. ls that clear? lf you find the markings on the cards l'll send the kid to the school. lvan, if you blew away all our money, we won't be able to afford it. "Our money"? lt's my money and l'm supporting you! Got it?! Come, my child, l'll put you to bed. -You whores! You're all whores! Get in bed. Calm down. Come to me. Everything will be ok, l'll sing you a lullaby. Where are you? At home. Get your ass over there now. l'm at home with my family. Listen, asshole, there're a ton of cops out there. You know what willhappen if the bimbo starts yelling? But l tied her up real good. Now you see why you owe me money and not the other way around? Because l know the works. Do you know how many times people who were tied up good, escaped? Get your ass over there, retarded Spiderman! Go fuck yourself! Moron! Quiet. Quiet. Calm down. Calm down. l'll untie you. Forgive me for what l did earlier. Wait. Here, wash yourself. Thank you. l lived in kiev with my mother. There was a guy there who used to hang out under our home. His name was Sasha. Handsome. Cool car. We started going out. After my mom had met him she said to me: "He's a good guy. "Listen to him." Then he said they're arranging a well-paying job for him in Europe. Then he said that if l didn't listen to him he'd kill me. They use love to entrap you... And my mom... Did they threaten your family too? Why did you exchange only 2 cards? l don't know, l wanted to spare the queen. Fuck the queen if she's useless to you. l told you it was a stupid game. lf you have nothing to gain or lose, then there's nothing to play for. l have 30 hryvnia. They're not see-through. Not to you, in any case. How many cards? Three. Fuck the queen. l want to keep playing. We don't wear the same size pants. You want me to pay with my clothes? Why not? You have to practice anyway. Ok. We're on. Open. Are you playing? No. Then shut the door. Why did you change seats? Change location, change your luck. Undershirt. Undershirt plus... Five. That's all you have. l'm betting everything. What cards do you have? Perhaps...? - You lost. Pay up. You'll thank me eventually. Want to play again? Yes. But you know the rules. l do. May l? What? - Can l deal the deck? Last game? How many cards? Three. Don't make a "poker face", what's with you? lf you're out of luck, you're out of luck. That's nice... Can l get up? l'll be right back. Can l have the cigarettes there, on the table? lt's cold. Then get dressed. You've paid your debt. So will l have to lose another game now? Are you serious? Why? Would you like an omelet? - No, just cereal. Where's your bowl? - l've been looking for it for days. Good morning, Daddy. - Good morning, sweetie. Want to eat? l'll have whatever Anya is having. She's having cereal. - What's that? Open it. Don't tear the wrapping, we might need it. l'll buy you new wrapping paper, Natasha. You said they didn't have this book at the library, so l got it for you. Anya, don't be late for school. Daddy, can l take the book with me? Of course, honey, it's yours. You can do whatever you like with it. Thank you very much, Daddy. Goodbye. Wake me up in two hours. Whatever l say, don't let me fall back asleep. Ever since l left all l thought about was coming back and doing this to you. Am l pleasuring you? Come, l'll feed you. l'll make it for you. The person you're selling me to... is he the one you owe money? Yes. lt aggravates me, you know? lt's aggravating. l know he marked the cards. The deck is marked... lt's not the money... l understand, you simply want to know. Should l make you some tea? Hello? - What's up? Everything's ok. - ls she ok? Yes. l sent Zhura over to you. He'llgive you some food and cash. lvan? - Yes? l'm giving you 200 hryvnia for shopping. You hear? Yes. -The guy who's coming to get her willgive you money. l'll come after they've left, but not immediately. l don't want to be seen. Ok. How much is he supposed to give me? - None of your business. So how will l know that he gave me the entire sum? Oh, yeah... you're right. 10,000 Euros. l see. - Good. When he arrives, let him look at her, show him her teeth, her cunt, show him she has no scratches there. - Yes. lf he wants he can fuck her, but first the money. l understand. - What did you understand? l'll show him her teeth. Her cunt. lf he wants he can fuck her, but first the money. Very good. Don't screw it up. There willbe more. -Ok. ln no time you'll forget you owe me money. -Yes. lvan... untilnow l've spoken to you nicely, but bear in mind that if something goes wrong with the girl or the money l'llsend my toughest hounds to get you. Understood? lt wasn't on purpose. Never mind. - Take the tea, l'll clean up. Here, l got some stuff. How is she down there? Just as she was. How about l fuck her today? l wanted to myself, but she's bleeding. lt stinks like hell. Really? Perhaps some other time. What? Oh... 200. What? What we're doing here isn't good. Yes, it's not good. Then why are you doing this? Because l want to. You know you've paid your debt a long time ago. Let's not talk. Words ruin everything. l'm tired. l want to sleep. Sleep. l'll take it to work tomorrow. My God! You won't tell him l was here, will you? Yes, hello? - Are you outside? Yes, l went out to buy some things. - Giving her room service, huh? Look, whoever lets a hooker play with his head is left with no head. What? Why are you fucking me? What? l asked, why are you fucking me? You think l'll get you out of this? You think you have a diamond between your legs? That l'll get so confused that l'd risk my family and set you free, you little shit? Answer me, you slut. ls that what you think? Answer me, you whore! Answer me, you stinking whore! Want to play with my head? l'll show you what happens when you do. You'll be sorry you ever met me, bitch! l'm a bitch? l'm playing with your head? My entire life is falling apart, l've never been a hooker. You think l planned on falling in love with you? You think l wanted to fall in love with a scumbag who ties a girl to a bed like a cow about to be slaughtered?! You're an animal! But what can l do? God above causes people to fall in love even with animals like you. Tie me up and go. l don't want to see you. That's how my dad used to punish me for lying. l'll be back tomorrow. lf you say that you love me one more time, l'll fill up the bucket again. ls that clear? You can fill the bucket with shit. l don't want you to forgive me. l'm such an animal. You know... l told you, words ruin everything. l have less than a week left here. Please don't hurt me. - l won't. Promise? - Promise. You rarely get angry at people. Everyone has a weakness. l'll make you some tea. Nika... l think l love you. You don't get it, do you? Let me explain it. ln 3 days there will be a knock on the door. You'll get money and l'll be taken far away. A long queue will form and people will buy tickets to get into my body. lf someone doesn't like something they'll make a new hole in me and there'll always be a scumbag who'll fuck me there too. A week from now there will have been enough men inside me to fill a bus. ln a month... a train. ln a year... a stadium. So for your sake and mine, don't tell me you love me. Nika... l love you. l have to go. l'll be right back. My God! What's taking you so long? Come on! Hurry. Come on! What now? l'm leaving you. - What? l'm leaving you. Natasha, l don't have time now. -God willpunish you for what you've done. Yes. - You hear me?-Yes. The client is coming to take the merchandise today. He's in town. He'llbe there at night, got it? lvan? lvan? - Yes. You remember everything? Don't forget to count the money. 10,000 Euros. l know. Ok. lf it allgoes well, you're off the hook. There's another package arriving in 2 days. Thanks. l know you can't make outgoing calls. He'llbe by you at around 24:00. l'll come by at around 24:15. Ok? Great. Natasha? Natasha! Anya? Yes? -Untie her, so that she doesn't have marks. What's wrong? lvan, what's wrong? You're scaring me, what happened? You were afraid l would escape, huh? And you didn't. Why didn't you? Do you know what they would have done to you if l had escaped? l'll try to run away from them. Nika, they're coming to get you ahead of schedule. Tonight, in 3 hours. So what do l have to...? l have to pack... Listen. l understand you did what you did because you had no choice. l want to give you a present, but promise me you'll stay away from those people. Pick a card. Not now. - lvan, pick a card. king of spades. Pick another one. Prince of clovers. They tricked you. These cards are marked. Are you lvan? l'm Dimitri. Dima, for short. Well, are we gonna keep standing here? You don't close deals like this in the hallway. She's pretty. Do you have her passport? - Yes. But first you have to give me something. 10,000, count it. l'll go get the passport. We'll get to know each other meanwhile. Where are you from? What did you do?! lvan, what did you do?! They'll kill you! No, they won't. Franco is on his way to collect the money. But he won't come alone. - He will. He's not scared of me. That scumbag will pay for everything. Sit here and wait. Well, did everything go smoothly? - Yes, smoothly. So why are you looking at me like that? l'm bringing you the money. - Good, thanks. ls this a joke? Maybe, but it didn't make me laugh. Show me the markings on the cards. Make me laugh. Oh, my leg! That's it... My leg... He broke my leg. What happened? - He was still alive and wounded me. Did he hurt your face? Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch... Train information. -Hello, when is the next train abroad, please? Tellme where you want to go. - Wherever. Abroad. There's a train to Prague leaving at 2:30 and one to Sofia at 3:00. Thank you. My hand wasn't as good but l won. You know? You... You know... At first l didn't know if l should run away with you or not but then l saw your wife... Yes, she was here... l didn't want to end up with the look she had in her eyes.
