- Mommy loves you. Oh, baby. It's just you, me, and our dolls. We don't need nobody else. Don't look at this, you can't have that yet. Pretty soon, couple years. Sweet, sweet mommy juice. Alright, baby, Mommy has to go get beautiful. So you stay with our dolls, okay? Our easy, easy peasy. Espanola, safety instructions. 24 hours before use, allergy test, irritation, well-ventilated. Heck with it. Fuckin'. Benji, are you hungry? Hold on, baby. Mommy's got some food for you! You want a chip? Baby, you like that? Oh, that's Mommy's favorite, too. This shit burns. The price of beauty. This is really burning, Benji. What? What the fuck? Oh, my God! What the fuck? Oh, my God. Benji! - Come on. - If you'd like $200 worth, I'll throw in a loofa and a chapstick. - Mm. - If you bought $300 worth, you get lipstick on top of that. - Ow! Can I have the orange one you tried on me earlier? - I think we can work that out for you. - Next time, I think I'll get the Wrinkle Melter. - Mm-hmm! It really works. - Yeah? - You just gotta be careful, because the chemicals will burn your face right off. It really will, I'm not kidding. - Will it burn off some age? - No. - Goddamnit, Mitzi, don't you see me watchin' TV over here? - Shut the fuck up! - Shut the fuck up, yourself. - Hey, is that Benji? - Mm-hmm. He's getting big. - Yeah, big pain in my ass! - Must've been hard takin' him in, after Tina Lyn's accident. - Well, she certainly was a weird one, and he is just like her. - Hey, Benji. Nice dancing, Benji. Keep it up, doll boy. That's so great. - Come on, doll boy, dance. - Nice dancing, Benji. Woo-hoo. - Oh, Crystal, honey, could you come and take this to your mother? She forgot it. Thank you, dear. Benji, what the hell happened? You're a mess! You get in the house and get cleaned up! And you'd better not get any on the carpet! - Here's your girlfriend, Kenny. I'm gonna grow a beard. We've been in here so long, haven't we, Jimmy? Yes, we have. We both have big beards. I just shaved. - Woo! Yeah, that's some real nice shootin'. Draggin' his ass on the carpet, this dog. I think it's worms. - Goddamn, that shit ain't contagious? - No! - Never been so fucking embarrassed at the little asshole was covered in paint, and dancing for his dolls. - Got any hot sauce? - Hey, asshole! - What? - You don't do shit around here. The least you could do is go talk to him, and try and turn him into some kind of man. Either that or go get a job. - Goddamnit. Quit jackin' off in there! - I'm not! - What'd you do, flush yourself down the toilet? You wearin' your panties in the tub again? Get out of there! How many times have I told you about that? Now, come on, get out of there, right now! - The monster's gonna suck me down the drain! - Get out! Get out! I got somethin' I gotta talk to you about. Now you come on out here. Take a look at these. - Ew! - Quit fuckin' around with them dolls! Don't know what the hell I'm gonna do with you. Oh. Look, all this stuff you got in here, this artsy, craftsy shit? That stuff is for girls. These dolls. It ain't right for a little boy to be playin' with dolls. Come on now. Here, give me that. You and me, we're gonna take care of this right now, alright? - Stop, that's my mom! - Your mom's dead. Let go, let go, goddamnit! Let go! All of this, down. Down, down. - Stop! - Listen to me. Listen to me! - Don't take down my art! - Listen to me! Your grandmother doesn't want you fuckin' around with this stuff anymore. What your grandmother says, goes. That's my meal ticket, now sit down! You know what? I'm done with this. - I love you, mom. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Who would like to volunteer for my next trick? You there, in the front row. Come on down! - I won! So exciting, oh, my Gosh! - As you can see, I have no tricks up my sleeves. No! - Now, for my next trick, I'll turn a member of the audience into a cat. Alakazam! There's this game called Half-Life, and on the zombie mode, there's these things that people keep saying they're turkeys, but they're head crabs. They jump on your head, and they turn you into zombies. - Get a fuckin' job, it would be nice. I'm tired of me, takin' on all this shit, on myself. Always have to make the money, go out every mornin'. I'm just sick of it, just fuckin' sick of it. Tell you what, if I were a fuckin' TV, you'd probably pay a little bit more attention to me, huh? Yeah. - Maybe. - Probably not. Tell you what, darlin', I'm tired of bein' your fuckin' sugar mama. - Hey! - What? - Not you. The hell you talkin' to, over there? - My friends. - You hear that, Mitz? Friends. - What friends? - All I see over here is a bunch of goddamn dolls! Woo! - But the dolls are my friends. - Friends. How about I take one of your friends here, and I smother your ass with it, so I don't have to listen to you talkin' and gagglin' with them all day? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, I was just messin' with ya. Geez. Mitz, why'd you have to raise your granddaughter to be such a pansy? - His mom did that, not my fuckin' fault. - Come on, now. Eat your breakfast. - I'm goin' to work. - Bye, grandma. - Benji, go play and take your fuckin' dolls with you. - Okay. - Gotta let these people know. 'Cause I know, I know they're usin' it to find me. I tried to warn all you. Joan, you don't believe me. I know the truth. Don't believe me though. They told me that's a tracker. If I let the other one, I left out one in obeche. Still there. I'm ready! I'm gonna have my revenge. I'm gonna have it. - The kind of culture we live in now. I was reading a story about woman in Portland, Oregon. Recently, pulled him out of public school, because of bullying. Her perception of bullying, the child's perception of bullying, what have you. She is bringing suit against the public school system. This kind of activity -- Goddamnit, I'm beginning to get a little bit upset reading about it all the time. I don't know what kind of court would entertain such a thing. - Benji. - Hi, Mommy. I'm so happy to see you, Mommy. Oh, sorry. - Catch anything yet? - No. - Oh, man. Let me tell you something, little buddy. I was fishing here about 12 years ago. Caught a mermaid. She dragged me in the water, she almost drowned my ass. Just as I was half-conscious, she brought me back to shore, and she revived me. - I don't believe you. - I swear to you, buddy. I swear to ya. She said, "Do unto others, "as you would have them do unto you." I never forgot that. Even two years ago, when aliens came down, they took me, they took my wife, and then they took me. I tried to tell them the same thing. I said, "You've gotta treat others "how you want to be treated." They didn't listen. They didn't listen. They put them probes in my ass, they did all them tests, and they put me back down here. - Are you telling me you got abducted by aliens? - But I told 'em one more thing, before they brought me back. I said, "I'm gonna have my revenge." - Revenge? Really? - Yes, sir, little man. Yes, sir. Sometimes you just gotta get your revenge. And revenge is sweet. Remember that. Revenge is sweet. - There a dog in there? - Hey, get over here, kid. What're you doing? Have a seat. - Hi, I came for the dog. - Hold on, first of all, what's your damn name, kid? - Benji. - Benji, huh? Doesn't sound very macho to me. Now, what dog you talkin' about? - The dog I heard barking. - What, the dog behind you? - Yeah. - That's my wet dog. Hey, dog. This is my favorite goddamn show on TV. You don't see that? It's called Mash Continues. That's my favorite character right there, his name is Ruford. He's a big 'en. - Why does he stink so bad? - Well, it smells so bad 'cause we both got damn worms. That and, well, I do have chlamydia, and, yeah, all the anal sweat, and festering snot and man batter that's been cloudin' up this damn couch of mine. Oh, that and the masons jars filled with festering urine, it might be that. I do have crotch rot. I'm sure that doesn't help much either. Oh, I got a closet full of dirty diapers, that has maggots all over it. Might be that. Or it might be the shedding skin on my testicle sack. Could be that. Anyway, kid, they call me Rock Bottom. I don't know if you know who I am, but I'm real famous down there in Tijuana. I used to open up for the donkey show. You know what the donkey show is, boy? Nah, it don't matter. I tell you what, since you're here, why don't you let me treat you to some damn comedy? You can be my live audience. Sound good? - Okay. - Buckle up. How you doin', folks? My name is Rock Bottom. Rock is my middle name, Bottom's my last name, and my first name is Beyond. Anyway, I'm glad you could make it here tonight. You guys look like a real live bunch. So anyway, I just moved out of these shitty, ghetto, low income apartments, where I've spent the last decade, being depressed. I always hear about poor folk who, somehow, manage to acquire wealth and give back to their hometown and their communities. Lately, I've been fantasizing about the day I become rich, and I'm asked to give back to my hometown of Modesto, California. Then, the fantasy gets really intense, because I know when they ask me to give back to the community, I'm gonna say, "Fuck no! "What fuckin' community? "The fuckin' community that made me depressed? "The hometown that broke into my car, "twice a week, and stole my fuckin' stereo? "The community that had me on food stamps, "'cause I couldn't get a fuckin' job? "'Cause there's no opportunity in that scum-ridden, "skin tack neck, pus-billed, cyst boil, "inbreeding capitola of California? "You want me to give back to that community? "You want me to give back to the "hometown that gave me hepatitis? "I was infested with the most gruesome tweaker, "crackhead, cousin-humping, scab-scraping, anal-raping, "crumb-bum dirtbags, with more tattoos than teeth? "You want me to give back to that community? "Sure, how much? "You take a check?" Anyway, I'm glad you could make it here tonight. You guys look like a real live bunch. So anyway, I just started online dating. I went to this top dating site in the nation, and I guess I was desperate, because I was filling out a profile, you know, 'cause I wanted to meet some girls, 'cause I hadn't had sexual intercourse in at least five years. So I started this profile, and entered my information, uploaded a photo. Things were goin' great, I was already gettin' the matches, with the kind of girls that have similar interests. Everything was goin' great, but the last thing they had me enter, was my annual income. I was like, "I don't want to lie, "'cause if I go on a date with this girl, "she's gonna know I don't have that much money." I told the truth, and I entered my annual income. Moments later, when the page was loading, and they ended up matching me up with a couch and a bottle of hand lotion. I'm a fucking world-class comedian. I'm a comedian. I'm a fuckin' comedian. I'm a fuckin' comedian. I'm not a comedian, I'm a fuckin' comedian. I'm a fuckin', I'm a fuckin' comedian. You know what? Get out! Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out of my comedy club, and take that snuffly, wet dog with ya! Get out, and don't look back. Get the F out, now, and don't look back, ever! - What games do you like to play? I like to play this game where you're a cowboy, and you have a horse. You can walk or you can ride on the horse, but -- - Brought you a snack. Did you shit your pants? What are you doing? - Nothing. - What the hell is that? You brought a fucking dog in here. Donald? - It's Gunner. - What? - Get your ass in here! - What? - Get the -- - Whoa. - Get it the fuck out of here. - Oh, my God, it smells like shit. Benji, Benji, give me that dog. - Fucking disgusting! - I'll wash him! - Benji, that's a dog that smells like poo-poo, he's gotta go out of the house. - I'll wash him! I'll wash him! - Let go, Benji! - Let go of him! Goddamn, I am not gonna clean that carpet, don't you even ask me to. - Bringin' a fuckin' dog home. - I hate you! - Oh, God, it smells. - Can't handle this fuckin' kid. The mother dies and I'm stuck with the little bastard. You know what? I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna fuckin' kill him. I'm gonna kill him and send it back to his mother. - Hey, hey. Baby, help. Mitz? - Shut up! Shut up! I've had it with you! I've had it with you and your fucking little dolls! - Grandma? - Just go to sleep, Benji. - Mommy, I'm home. - Benji! Welcome home, dear. Hope you had a wonderful day at work. - You bet, but I couldn't wait to get home. - Aww. - Now, take a load off, because Mommy has a special surprise for you. I sure hope you're hungry, 'cause I made all your favorites. - Hi, Benji. - Is everything tasty? - Delicious. - Good, 'cause I just want everything to be perfect for my little doll. I love you, son. - I love you, Mommy. - Fuck. - Why settle for a realistic rubber dong, when you have the real shit right here? It's bigger than the one you got. - It's not what it looks like, you fuckin' freak. - Shit or get off the pot, Benji. - Get out of there, Benji! Don't stand there with the 'frigerator open. You're gonna catch pneumonia. - Hey. - Now, either grab somethin' or get out of the kitchen! Oh, quit acting like I beat you, just disappear for the day. Turn the damn thing down. - You talk so goddamn loud. - By the power invested in me, I now pronounce you saved! Hallelujah! - What are you doing? - Baptizing my dolls. - Are you gonna get baptized? - Grandma Mitzi said Mom's in Hell. - What does that have to do with anything? - If I get baptized, I'll never see her again. - Oh. Well, will you baptize me? - Okay. Away with you demons! - Did it work? - I think so. - Hey, turds! I can't believe you're hanging out with him. - I'm not. - See you later, freak. - Mm. - Not filling in your eyebrows is like getting dressed without any shoes. Let's see. Now, just remember, they're sisters, and not twins. - So your products, don't they test on animals? - Oh, absolutely. - Oh, thank God. I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't gonna do anything bad to my skin. Do you have anything for my freckles? - Oh, we certainly do. This wrinkle cream has been specially formulated, for wrinkles, but they found that it has great results for unwanted imperfections. - Hmm. - Oh, honey, no, no. Now, this may tingle a bit, but that just means it's working. - Oh, it does tingle. - Feeling alright? - Uh, it's burning a little bit. - Oh, well, good. I think we'd better take care of that now. Let's just wipe this off now. It looks like it's doing just wonderful. There we go. Now, close your eyes, so we don't get it in your eyes. There we go. Oh, well, my! Be careful there, honey. Let's just cover some of this up, dear, and then you'll be ready to go. Oh, yes. You are definitely gonna love my products. Oh, you look absolutely gorgeous. - Alright, how do I look? - Well, let's take a look-see. - Ooh, I love it. I'll take it all. Do you take EBT? - I sure do. Benji! Benji! Benji, get your ass out of bed! Get your fucking ass up now. We gotta go. - Why? - I said, let's go, now! - Where are we going? - We're gonna go pick up Donald's stupid ass. That bastard thinks he can sit around the house all day, and then fuck around with the bar at night. Well, he's got another thing comin'! I didn't work this hard to become district manager of Dolly Face, to put up with this bullshit! Should be just loungin' around on a beach somewhere, with a margarita in one hand, a tropical drink in the other. But no, no, no, no. I get to be here with you two shitheads. Oh, lucky, lucky me! Bastard. - Do you love Donald? - Put some chapstick on. Now, sit down and don't move. I'll be right back. - No, I'm workin' late. No, I promise, I ain't doin' nothing bad. Hey, fuck you! Oh, no, no, not you, darlin'. Oh, no, no, don't worry about it. It's alright. No, no, no. Oh, don't get that way. - You're wet. - Right. - I'm lookin' for a new friend. - A new friend? Anyone in particular? - I don't know, I guess we'll see. - Enjoying yourself, sweetie? - Hey, baby, how you doin'? - Get real! - Come on. Come here, don't -- - What the fuck are you doing here? - I'm just blowin' off some steam here! It's just a, she's a friend of mine. - I see that! - You are fuckin' off your rocker! That's why I love you, baby! - Oh, baby, I love you, too, baby. Go home now. - Are you taking me? - Just walk. - But it's cold out there. - You'll be fine. - I made it home. I'm hungry, I gotta find myself some food. Ooh, pa-sketti. * We are the creeps, the weirdos and freaks * The ones who make the world afraid Ooh!

We all love you. - But everyone's mean to me. - We can fix that. - How? - Kill them. - Kill them? - Yes, Benji. Kill them all. - Not again. - Hi, welcome to our little family. Would you like to come into our house, and see how happy we are? Oh, what a wonderful father I am, to my daughter. - You've never been a good father. You make me do weird, creepy things. Why do I have to give you a sponge bath every night? Ew! - I lovingly saved you from that stroller in the park. - You killed my mother. I would have a mother, if it wasn't for you. - I just dug a giant hole, and she fell in it. - Oh, I like that, that looks funny. Maybe even for all those tattoos. I could do that. - Me and Julie were down by the creek, and we saw a lizard. It was really cool. - Who the hell is Julie? - One of my dolls. - Benji. Ow! Now look what you made me do!

Shit. - Shut up! - Poor baby! He's embarrassed. - Benji? Benji? - Whoa! - You made me drop my candy, jerkwad. - Can I have some? - You can eat the ones on the ground. - Really? Okay. - I can't believe you're actually eating those. - Here, check this out. - What the hell? Where'd you get this. - I found it in that old, rundown trailer. There's more, too. - Yeah, right. - I'm serious, go check! - If I go there, and you're lying, I'm gonna kill you. - Cross my heart. - You're weird, dude. - Ow! - Later, asswipe. - Keep talkin' that crap. - Holy crap, doll boy wasn't kidding. Benji? You dick. Please stop. Mommy. - Grandma, can I sleep with you tonight? I'm lonely. - I don't care. What's wrong, baby? - I don't know, I just miss Mom. - Benji! You were a baby when she died. You have no right to miss her. She was my daughter. If anybody has a right to miss her, it's me. Now, I don't want to hear anymore about it. - Okay. - Surprised to see me? Geez, calm down. Can't believe you actually killed me, dude. It's lame in Hell. All there is to do is eat vegan cheese and drink diet soda. I tried to kill myself once, but I was already dead. But I don't need to tell you that now, do I? - It's not like on TV? - Nope, no cenobites, no cool robot devil, no black metal blaring. - Really? - You know, I was kind of hoping I could at least possess someone. You know, like make a hot chick do herself with a cross or something. - Hey, man, you alright? Hey, kid, you alright? - Yeah. - Hey, kid, you know what time it is? You better get on home. - Okay. - What? - Do you like it? - What the, holy shit! Benji. - Donald, you're so weird. - You little pecker! Cut this shit out, right now! Do you hear me now? You listen to me now, goddamnit. You little shit! Stop it. Benji, stop. I'm gonna throw up. Benji! Stop spinnin' this goddamn chair, right now. Pecker! Get me out of here! I'm gonna throw up.

You gonna kill me with your little art project, Benji? Go ahead. Go ahead. Go on, then! Show me that you got some fuckin' balls, for once in your life. Do it! You little fuck! You little pecker! No, stop! Stop it! Oh, you little, ah! - Kill, kill, kill him, kill! - Oh! Oh, God! Fuckin' dolls. - Hooray, Benji. Benji, you did it. - Fuck is it so dark in here? Drunk bastard. What the hell are you doing in here? Get your ass out here, it's my bathroom! Get me a drink! Now, won't you be a doll and get my foot bath ready for me, honey? And don't forget the bubbles! Mm! Mm! Oh, not enough scotch! Where the fuck the little fruit loop get that doll? Benji. Donald, Donald. Donald. Donald, wake the fuck up. Something, something is wrong. Benji, is that you? Benji. Honey, help your grandma, help your grandma up. Benji, you little fuck! What the fuck did you do to me? * Bring out your dead, bring out your dead * The streets are pouring * They're filled with decay, we wait * Until our hands are blistered * We are the few - 911, what is your emergency? - Yeah, the trailer across the street's lit up like a Christmas tree. - Do you know if anyone is still in the trailer? Well, I don't know. Some kid come out with a bunch of dolls or something, and then kaboom! Everything just went up. - Update to what is now being called the Dolly Deadly Murder Spree. This morning, in a rural part of the state, two bodies -- - The killer burnt down the trailer, then disappeared. So far, the fire has destroyed an entire block. - Three people were killed last night in, what authorities are calling the, Dolly Deadly Murders. - It's been three weeks, since the bodies of two adults, and one, young male child have been found. - Authorities discovered the victims were not killed in the fire. They were murdered by their eight year old grandson, with what appeared to be doll parts. - I knew that there was somethin' wrong with him. He was always playin' with dolls. I even told Martha how strange he was behaving. - I can't believe Benji would do something like this. I mean, you guys are best friends. - Mm-hmm. - Aww. What's the world coming to now? - Have you guys heard about this Dolly Deadly Murder Spree? I mean, seriously, there's this kid, who's, he's dressed like a Raggedy Ann or something. - It'd be really interesting to get his brain, and really look at it, and see what's going on there. He probably doesn't have a lot of empathy, so perhaps, he couldn't understand what he was actually doing, and he was just reacting on his own pain. But, man, it's a big deal to kill three people, especially at eight years old. - This is what police believe Benji would look like now. - Over the years, I've added quite a few pieces to the collection. This is one of my favorite purchases. It was actually one of Benji's original dolls. It was quite a expensive purchase on eBay. - Like, he killed, like, all of his parents, and like, he killed, like, a bunch of other people. It's just like really sad. Like, I understand why, but like, at the same time, like, parents are bad parents, if, like, they're letting their kids dress up in, like, girl's clothes and play with dolls. It's just not good. * Watch me work it, in my hooker shoes * Oh, watch me work it, in my hooker shoes, shoes * Shoes, shoes, shoes Everybody clap it up for our entertainer, Veronica Lakeside!
