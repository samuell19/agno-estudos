(slow suspenseful music) (fireworks bursting) (man groaning) (man gasping) (camera shutters clicking) (reporters clamoring) - Mr. Simmons, do you have a confession? - There were three shots, one grazed the shoulder, a shot to the body, slug to the head. It was a crime of passion. (reporters clamoring) - Mr. Simmons, how is this case gonna impact your political career? - We'll hold a press conference shortly, and I'll respond to all your questions then. Thank you. - Mr. Simmons, can you tell us anything else about the suspect? - Are you guilty, Mrs. Mass? - Hey, Bill. Detective Hicks here will assist with the interrogation. - You mean the lynching? - Counselor Miller. - Dwight. Listen, we all know that you're up for your boss's job. But let me ask you a question, is the truth getting in the way here? By the way, are we being recorded or videotaped? Because if we are, I'm gonna suggest that my client say nothing. - Richard, don't make this thing complicated. We have a motive, infidelity. Access to the murder scene. Prints on the murder weapon. Earrings, her earrings, found at the scene. No alibi. So we got the Holy Trinity: probable cause, access, motive. Let's be reasonable here. I'm willing to make a deal. - No deals. - I'm innocent. I'm a Christian, not a murderer. - Ah, um, Mr. Simmons, I'm not the negotiator that you are but would you mind letting me have a few moments with Ms. Mass here? - Go ahead, Detective. - Oh, I see, this is going to be a team effort. - I'm gonna need that confession. Time. - Mm-hmm. He's got a press conference. We don't have a whole lot of time. - That's not our problem. - Mm, yeah, but it is, it is. Now you playin' the Christian card, good old God-fearin' black woman. Miss Spelman College. - Don't patronize me. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's not me that you should be worried about. It's the jury that you should be worried about, without the slightest hint of remorse, confession, that jury just might give a spiritual woman like yourself a free ticket to heaven, courtesy of the state. - Detective. - Hmm? - Do you go to church? - Oh, yeah. C.M.E. Christmas, Mother's Day, and Easter. - Valerie, you don't have to respond to any of this. You're not on trial here. - I'm not worried, and I have nothin' to hide. But I must be allowed to tell everything. - Fine. (clears throat) How long is everything gonna take? - Before I was accused of murder, before my family was ripped apart. (hip-hop music) (child shouts) - Ah, Philly's all right. - Yeah, but I got big dreams, you know? - [Robert] Whoa, the prettiest girl in the world. Huh? (chuckling) - Hey! - What's up? - Hey, girl. Hey, Daddy. - Everything good? - Yes, girl. Practically all moved in. - Good, so how's the new place? - Oh, it's nice, it's nice. You know, it ain't big-- (slaps butt) (Valerie squeals) - Watch out now. - [Valerie] (laughing) It's not big, but, you know. - Girl, you deserve the best, and that's exactly what you gonna get. - What I need right now is a church. - I told you, you are gonna love Mercy Baptist. - All right, well I'm ready to go now. - All right then. I'm late for work, I'll hit you later. Okay? - All right. - Grandpa! Are you helping us? - Shh, forget that grandpa stuff now. - [Dutch] Go on, go inside. Don't look at that. (Robert chuckling) - Daddy and Grandpa are looking at B-U-T-T-S. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - What? Uh-huh. - It's nice that you had such a warm and fuzzy reception, but is this relevant? - Look, we're not gonna be railroaded just because your boss has a press conference. Listen, Val, anything you say, they can take and twist it any way that they want. A jury can be manipulated. - I have nothing to hide. And, yes, Detective Hicks, everything I'm about to tell you, it's all relevant. - So I took a look at your portfolio, looks good. I'm gonna recommend you for some photo shoots we got comin' up. - Are you serious? - Am I serious? - Don't play with me. - I ain't playin' with you. (Valerie exclaims) - Uh-uh, chill it out, it's nothin' immediate. But I'm definitely down for hookin' my girl up. - [Valerie] All right. - That's a real sacrifice, you givin' up your studio for your husband's career. You're so old-fashioned. - (laughs) Well, I love my husband. And, Zahara, he's worth it. - What's up, baby? - Dog! You see there? All men are dogs. All they need are fleas. And I met one last week who had some. - So tell me about Mercy Baptist, girl. - Oh, it's a nice church. Reverend Dunn and his wife, they don't just talk the talk. They walk the walk. They feed homeless folks, teach H.I.V. prevention. And Monday nights, women's group, which is fabulous. You must join us. - I'll be there. - Now Reverend Dunn starts Sunday services at 10:00 a.m. sharp. So none of that Delta C.T.P. time. - (laughs) No, C.P. time. And you can't say it right 'cause you're wrong. You never would've made it to class on time if it weren't for me. - Whatever, Miss Delta. - [Valerie] That's right, crimson and cream, baby. - Uh-uh, pink and green, girls with the pearls. (both laughing) Dog! - Girl, he didn't say nothin' to you. - He was thinkin' 'bout it. (both laughing) - For Dutch, the move from Atlanta was no big deal. You know, he grew up in Philadelphia. But for me, it was a place where all our dreams would come true. It never occurred to me that nightmares are dreams too. - "What do we have here?" snarled the huge wolf. (snarls tamely) - Not good enough. - What? - I'm warning you. - Mm-mm. Come on. "What do we have here?" snarled the huge wolf. (snarling) - Not good enough. - I think we need to-- - Yeah. - [Both] One, two. - What? - Three! - Come on, now, come on. (both shrieking) - I put the gun in my mouth. I started to pull the trigger. I saw my daughter's face crying. Then I realized how selfish I was being. Some days, everything matters. Some days, nothin' matters. - I want you to make a commitment, every day for the next 30 days. Deal? I'll see you tomorrow, same time. - Thank you, Doctor. - My pleasure. (exhales) (knocking on door) - Monica. - Dutch, good to see you. I'm sorry I wasn't here when you arrived. - Oh, no. - I was at a conference. I'm late for a meeting, but I need to talk to you. Can you walk with me? - Yeah, yeah. - It appears your time at Oxford has paid off. You've even picked up an accent. Good for business. - I know a mind is a terrible thing to waste. How are you and Kevin? - Miserable, as usual. But I might as well get to the point. We won't be able to pay the salary you requested. - I requested? Oh, you mean the salary you promised me. - No one's deceived you. Obviously, the offer was-- - Look, I moved my family up here from Atlanta. Now you're telling me there's no money? - Every contract has contingencies, subject to pending grants and all the fine print. But that's beside the point. I want you here. And I will do everything in my power to keep you here. Like old times, right? - Monica, that's inappropriate. I'm happily married. - Happily, so am I. - To one of my best friends. - As if Kevin would mind. Nothing's changed. We need to have this conversation later. Come to our surprise anniversary party. It's Sunday afternoon at the Academy of Fine Arts. - How can it be a surprise when you already know about it? - There are no secrets between us, Dutch. You know that. Ryan Chambers is hosting it for us. - Well I'm sorry, we go to church on Sunday. - Your presence is required, not requested, Dr. Mass. ♪ Praise the Lord ♪ ♪ Come on, come on ♪ ♪ Come on, come on ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ (woman vocalizing) ♪ Oh, Lord, come by me ♪ (woman vocalizing) ♪ Oh, Lord, come by me ♪ ♪ Someone needs you, praise the Lord ♪ - Yeah! ♪ Come by here ♪ (woman vocalizing) - Hallelujah! - Thank God! ♪ Come by here ♪ - Woo! - Praise God! - Thank you, Jesus! - Let the church say amen! - [Congregation] Amen! - Yes! - Hallelujah! - I'm talkin' about the land of the designer walk and the designer talk. The designer gowns and the designer frowns. Designer husbands, designer wives. Designer smiles, designer styles. - That's right. - All designed by the one who knows the weakness of the flesh is temptation. (congregation applauding) The flesh may call your name, but only God can call your soul! (congregation applauding) Only God can call your soul! Yes! Surrender, rich man. - Hallelujah! - Surrender, poor man. Surrender, beggar man. Surrender, thief. - Praise the Lord! - Surrender. When God calls you, surrender, adulterer. Surrender, liar. Surrender, kings, the presidents, and Indian chiefs. - Amen! - Surrender! - Hallelujah! - The time is drawing near for you to surrender. - Glory be to God! - Surrender.

(congregation applauding) Let him know. - Yes, God! - [Reverend] Let him know. Whoever you are, let him know. Come down. - [Valerie] Come on, Dutch, you ready? Let's go. - I'm not goin'. - Why not? - I just can't. - Dutch. - Go. - Is Daddy coming? - Daddy's gonna come next time, okay? - [Reverend] In pain. - Yes! - Those of you in confusion. - Hallelujah. - [Woman] Amen! - Those of you in deceit and despair. - [Woman] Hallelujah. (somber music) (upbeat soul music) - [Valerie] Dutch, I'm not thinking about this right now. I can't believe you did that today. - (sighs) There you go. Faith won't pay the bills. - [Valerie] What does that have to do with you joining church? - [Dutch] (sighs) Do we have to talk about this now, here? - What, you don't want me to embarrass you in front of your little friends? - [Dutch] Yeah, that's right. Can we drop it please? - All right, I'll leave it alone. I won't say nothin' else about it. - [Dutch] Hey, Monica, how you doin'? - That is you, mm! - This is Val, my beautiful wife. - I'm so glad to finally get to meet you, Val. - It's nice to meet you too, Monica. Dutch is always telling me about the good times you, Ryan, and Kevin had back in school. - Well, we used to say, a party ain't a party until Dutch Mass shows up. - Oh, well, happy anniversary to you. - 15 years of heaven and hell. There's my husband. (smacking lips) - Hey, baby. - He's crazy. - Hey, baby. - Hey, what's happenin', man? - Good to see you, man. - Good to see you. - This is Val. - Hello, Val. Great to meet you. I mean we had to work very hard to get your husband up here. But, uh, Atlanta's loss is definitely Philly's gain. I like that color on you. Takes a real man to pull that off. - [Dutch] Thanks. (both chuckling) - Hey, I'm going to the sculpture garden. Anybody wanna come with? - Dutch isn't going anywhere until he dances with me first. - Ooh, I would not disobey those orders, Doctor. See you. Val, hey, welcome to Philadelphia. City of Brotherly Love. - [Valerie] (chuckles) Okay. - Look, I'm not much of a dancer, so I'm gonna-- - Perfect, then I'll teach you. Do you mind, Val? - Oh, no, no, no, that's all right. Y'all go ahead, have a good time. - [Ryan] So you must be the lovely Ms. Dutch Mass. Ryan Chambers. - It's a pleasure to meet you, Ryan. - This is Cynda, she works for me. - Hi. - Pleasure to meet you. - You too. - Why don't you go get me a drink for 10 minutes, okay? - The usual? - The usual. What do you do, Mrs. Mass? - I'm a photographer. - So you love beautiful things. - Yeah, I do. - So do I. - Mm. - Death on a Pale Horse. Love it. My favorite image is the lion attacking, you? - I don't really have a favorite part. I guess I like the whole thing. - I bet you do. (Valerie laughs) What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Ryan. But I just love that song off your last album. - What song, there's a lot of songs on that album. - [Valerie] When. (laughs) No, I can't sing. - You know, come on now, just help me a little bit. ♪ What you gonna do when they ♪ ♪ Hurt you ♪ ♪ Where you gonna go when they lie to you ♪ ♪ Who you gonna call then run to ♪ ♪ When you know your life ain't right ♪ (Valerie laughs) - So, uh, you and Dutch ever dance to me? - Um, Dutch and I dance to a lot of your music. - Right. ♪ After school ♪ (Monica laughing) - Just stop it. Monica, come on, come on, stop. - So tell me, how long you know Monica? - We just met. - Come on, let's dance. - So Dutch told me that you, him, and Kevin were like the Three Musketeers back in the day. - Yeah, the scholar, the baller, and the flirt. - (laughs) So now, you are the scholar? - Guess again, baby. (Valerie chuckles) (Valerie clears throat) ♪ Wish I could find the right girl ♪ (unsettling music) - You ever wonder why Ryan Chambers would hit on a Southern belle like yourself? - At the time, yes. - (chuckles) Love 'em or leave 'em. You know what they say about a woman scorned. - Yeah, the same thing they say about an assistant D.A. running for office. Could we get on with this, please, Detective? - I knew something was wrong, I just didn't know what. - Ah. - Hey, Val, come on. (mellow music) - Boy, I'm coming. You can't rush perfection. - [Dutch] (scoffs) I know that's right. - Patience. - That's a virtue, right? - That's right, patience. - Uh-oh. (Dutch murmurs) - Where did you and Monica go? (Dutch sighs) - Come on. We didn't go anywhere. I told you. I went outside to the sculpture garden with Kevin and the fellas. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, right. Who's the one there dancin' all close with Ryan Chambers? - (laughing) Oh, please! - You're so full of it, that's all right. Jealousy is a strong aphrodisiac. - (moans) Look at you. - Baby, come on. - Mm-hmm, you on my list. - Come on, let's-- - Yes, I wanna know why you didn't join church today. - I'll join next week, come on, move your arm. - You gonna join next week? - You said we wasn't gonna talk about that again. - I lied. - I will join next week. - Not because I told you. - (sighs) Val, why you gotta ruin the mood like this? - Well it's important. I wanna know if somethin' bothering you. - Nothing is bothering me. I was in a good mood until you started all this. - What is that supposed to mean? - Nothing, nothing. Nothin', I'm, (sighs) I just got a lot on my mind right now, you know, with the pay cut and everything. I'm just, you know, I'm trying to figure some things out. - We can tighten it up. I'll skip a few pedicures. - Baby, how would you feel... You know... What would you think if, if, if, you know, like-- - What is it, baby? - Maybe I'm not the man you think I am, you know? The man you want me to be. - Maybe I'm not always the woman you want me to be either. - Come here. Look at me. No matter what happens you know that I love you, right? You know? - Dutch, wait a minute, baby, you're scaring me. Is somethin' wrong? - No. (Dutch chuckles) No, no. Man, I'm sorry. No. Nothin'. It's the champagne talking, baby. - I love you, Dutch. - I love you more. (mellow music) (woman vocalizing) (bell tolling) - Good evening, ladies. Let's welcome Mrs. Mass to our Women's Faith Fellowship. - Oh, yes. (women clapping) - I just want to say how grateful I am to be here. I'm a guest of my good friend, Zahara. Me and my husband, Dutch, and my daughter, Nicole, just moved up here from Atlanta. And I just wanna say how grateful I am to meet all you ladies. And how grateful I am, more than anything, to be back in the house of the Lord. - Amen, amen! - And I give God all the glory and all the praise. - Amen! - I am Mrs. Persons. I would like to welcome you. And tell me, what does your husband do? - He's a psychiatrist. - Problem-solver. - I might need him. - [Women] Praise the Lord. - Now, the topic for this evening, ladies, is how to, within our faith, deal with spousal cheating in a constructive way. - [Woman] Amen. - Yes, Miss Gladys. - My husband cheated on me one time with some filthy Jezebel. I snatched that heifer bald. - Mm-hmm! - Her dog tried to bite me. I snatched the dog bald too. - Amen! - Let's remember two things, ladies. Let's find constructive responses, and let's keep God in this. - Amen. - Yes, Ms. Honeycomb? - I kept God in it. - Amen. - Sent my husband to meet him. - Amen. - He cheated on me, so I went down to Miss Dashon down in Chinatown, got some of that strong dust pepper, mixed it in his mashed potatoes. He was null and void. - Null and void. - His head could not lift from the pillow. He didn't know what happened to him. But after that, he ain't cheat on me no more. (knocking on door) - Amen to that. - [Mrs. Dunn] Constructive responses, Ms. Honeycomb. - Amen to that, sister. - May I help you? - Excuse me, sorry I'm late. - I'm sorry, the men's meeting is Thursday. - I told you this was a bad idea. - I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come. - Greg, wait. Mrs. Dunn, I'm sorry. Greg's my guest. He didn't want to come, but I insisted. And I told him that he would be more than welcome. - We beg your pardon. - Yes, he-- - That's a group decision. - Sure is. - I know, but Greg has something that he needs to discuss that can't wait until Thursday. His significant other just left him. - Significant other? - Boyfriend. - Oh, help us, Jesus. - If my presence offends anybody, I'll go. - Nobody said anything about being offended. This is supposed to be a women's meetin'. - Sure is. - Tolerance, ladies. - Compassion. - Let's remember, we are all children of God, including Greg. - Amen. - Now Greg, the question is, would you feel comfortable here? - Feels just like my family. - Welcome, Greg. Ladies. - Welcome, Greg. - Welcome, darlin'. - Welcome. - Huh! - [Mrs. Dunn] So, Greg, would you care to share with us? Take your time. (Greg exhales) - The thing that hurts the most (breathes deeply) is the betrayal. We got engaged a year ago, and all that time, he was cheating on me with another man, a younger man. And I never saw it. (crying) I still love him. - Oh, help us, Jesus. What is this church comin' to, Mrs. Dunn? - Now, if you can't share with the group. Ladies. (ladies murmuring) I'm sorry, Greg. May God bless you, son. - My son, uh, Randy, he just came out of the closet. Do you know him? - Good Lord, it's spreadin' all over the church. - We came here this evening to talk about infidelity. Can we please stick to that topic? Charlotte, it's your turn. Do you have anything to say? - [Honeycomb] Hmm! - [Mrs. Dunn] May we bow our heads in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father. - Mm-mm. - [Mrs. Dunn] We come before you this. - I'm gonna make you an offer, Mrs. Mass. Now I am willing to recommend clemency. Lethal injection is not the only way to go here. A confession made in the spirit of remorse is very persuasive with a jury and with the district attorney's office. (dramatic music) - 31st floor. (Valerie breathing heavily) - [Mr. Simmons] Mrs. Mass. (dramatic music) (both speaking faintly) - (grunts) Hey. - What was that about? - I don't know what it is with Monica. She trippin' all the time. - Did you ever date Monica? - Hmm? - I didn't stutter. Did you date Monica? - A long time ago. Nothin' special. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - We had an agreement. And suddenly you can't deal, huh? - Suddenly? - Suddenly, you-- - Suddenly, Kevin? - I didn't change, okay? Monica, I didn't change. - I've changed. - Then you need to change back. Okay? We have a perfect life. We have money, we have freedom. And now you are miserable, you are hysterical. - But, Kevin. I want kids. I want a normal life. I want a family. I want a husband who wants me. - I want you. I love you, I love you. You know I do, but this normal thing, I just. - I'm tired. - [Kevin] You're tired? - I'm so tired. - You're gonna have to stick to the agreement. (unsettling music) - It just seems like. - You're always a victim. Everything just revolves around you, right? (keys jingling) Keys, I'll drive. Get out of the car, give me the keys. Monica? I'm gonna drive, just, I'll drive. Baby, come on and get in the car. Monica? (tires squealing) Hey, stop! (horn blares) (tires screeching) God, no! (siren echoing) The ambulance stopped just in time. She tried to kill herself, man. - Look, she's got a lot of narcotics in her system. - You know that conference that she attended? She was in treatment. I realized tonight how selfish I've been, not just to her, also to you. Hey, I got some good news. The, uh, grant came through at the hospital. They're gonna give you a raise. - (sighs) Oh, thank God. - And I'm gonna give you something that you deserve but you can't afford just yet. I've got a piece of property up in Chestnut Hill. Very upscale, nice schools. Big house. - You know, financially, I can't even think-- - Hey, don't worry, I'm gonna cover the down payment. You're gonna take care of the monthly nut. Just consider it a long-term lease. - Kevin, you don't have to do this. - You've done so much for me, and you've done so much for Monica. Without your counseling-- - Hey. - You and I go back a long way, right? Hey, Dutch, don't give up the dream. (bell chiming) - I got a surprise for you. - What, what is it? - Now if I tell you, it's not a surprise. - How about givin' me a hint? - Now let's just say some of our dreams are about to come true. - I want a hot dog. - Oh, yeah? - I'll go get the hot dog. - Oh, I'll have 20. - No. - Why don't you just give me our wallet? - Yeah, yeah, you got that right. - Yay! - Have fun! (Nicole squeals) - I felt like we were movin' in the right direction. (unsettling music) As my dearly departed mama used to say, "You wanna make God laugh? "Tell him your plans." - [Dutch] My feet are too quick. - Did you confront him? - No. - You found a condom in your husband's wallet, and you didn't-- - She said no. - He's a doctor. Sometimes he, he lectures patients on safe sex. He passes out condoms. - What do you think of it? - She didn't wanna know. - Mm. - Everything changed after that. - [Hicks] Uh-huh. - Me, I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him. I'm just bein' real, Val, I smell a rat. You should have him followed. I know this real good private detective, same one I used on my ex. - Now, Zahara, you know that Dutch is not that kind of a person. - What's the name of that heifer had herself a breakdown, Monica? That was a straight-up play for sympathy. I saw that crap from a mile away. - It was a nervous breakdown. - Breakdown, snakedown. Heifer'd do anything for a little attention. I knew this girl, stuck her hand down a garbage disposal, halfway cut her fingers off, cried for two weeks. Her husband bought her a new house and a car. I been thinkin' about cuttin' my fingers off. - I just cannot get that condom out of my head. Lord, why did I find it? - You trippin', you lucky you did. Now you just gotta get your mind off it, that's all. - What is the chance of that happening? - Knowin' you, slim and none. - Thank you. - Hey, we handlin' this new lifestyle piece at work, rich celebrities kickin' it in their bling-bling homes. We could use another photographer. That's right, I got you, on both fronts. - What you mean on both fronts? - I said I'm watchin' Dutch. - So, you had your husband followed. - She did not say that. - I did not have him followed. - But you let it happen. - She's not responsible for other people's actions. - Detective, I know why you're sittin' here so patiently. You waitin' for me to slip up and say somethin' that's gonna wrap up your case in a nice little package. Well let me make it easy for you. - Val, listen, why don't we put a pin in this? We don't need, shh-- - I confess, I'm guilty. - Say again. - I'm guilty. I'm guilty of being naive. - You tryin' to play us, Mrs. Mass, like you played your husband? - You do realize these are unfounded allegations, Dwight? - Hold, wait, wait. Why would a Georgia peach like yourself leave your fingerprints on a gun? (dramatic music) (shutter clicking) (shutter clicking rapidly) (dramatic music) - [Valerie] Kevin convinced Dutch that if he was gonna treat the rich he needed to be one of 'em, adopt the lifestyle. (door hinges squeaking) When I look back on it now, either I couldn't see or-- - Open your eyes, huh? - didn't want to. Oh, my God! Is this ours? - This is ours. - [Valerie] The cars we didn't need and couldn't afford. The Louis Vuitton, the Gucci. We had everything a man and a woman could want. - She's got her room all ready. Let's go see it, come on, guys. - Or so I thought. - Kevin, I owe all of this to you, thanks. - Don't thank me yet, because, uh, you know how payback can be. (chuckles) - Yeah. - Oh, this house is so rare. I'm proud of you. - It is more than I ever expected, and I am so happy. - What if I rephrase it? - Please tell me I'm not the only gay man here. - (laughs) I'm afraid so, baby. - Hey, uh, how's she doin'? - It's time to go. (knocking on door) It's time to go! - The party is here. (laughs) I know you meant to invite me. There a bathroom up here? 'Cause my ladies need to go. - [Dutch] Upstairs and down the hall. - I think I'm gonna go with 'em. I like the view from here, mm! (woman giggling) - Excuse me, can I just, uh, steal my wife? - Oh, yeah, excuse me. - Sorry. - Come on. - (laughing) What, what? - Listen. Now, there's no way I can thank you for your support over the years. But, uh-- - What you got? - Here's a small token. - What? (both laughing) - Oh, man, is that? ♪ The time is your own ♪ - Thank you. - What do you want to do next? - Look at that man. (women chuckling) - What are you doin'? - What's it look like I'm doin'? - My daughter's upstairs. - Dutch, no, no, no, it's all right. Dutch, Dutch, it's all right. - No, this is my house. - I thought it was Kevin's house and I thought this was a party. - You know, okay, I'd like for you to leave. - Kevin, ain't this your house? - Is this necessary, Ryan? - I'm just tryin' to clear up a discrepancy here. That's all, my bad. - Just get out. Take your girlfriends and get out. - Come on, we gonna go to a real party. - Yeah. - A Ryan Chambers party. Y'all wanna come to a fun party? Come to Ryan Chambers's party, ha! - If your significant other isn't attending church, this can be the beginning of a serious rift in the relationship. Yes, Sister Mass. - What do you do, Sister Dunn, if your significant other says he wants to be a part of the church. - [Woman] Mm-hmm. - But come Sunday, he always has some excuse not to go? - Or an excuse. What if honesty wasn't there from the beginning? - What did you say, Charlotte? - I was just agreeing with Val. - [Dunn] Well, amen. - Amen. - Hallelujah. - Amen. - I see you wearin' some new bling-bling, Mrs. Mass. - It's a gift. - Uh-huh. (laughs) (unsettling music) - Was she starin' at me? - She sure was. You know that child been comin' here for months and hasn't said a word until tonight. I think she got some issues. (pounding on door) - [Valerie] Hey, Monica. - Where the hell is Dutch, huh? Dutch! - Monica, Dutch is not here. - Where the hell is Dutch with my prescriptions, huh? - Monica, Dutch is not here. - Dutch! - And, girl, what happened to your face? - Have to hurt myself a little of today if that's okay with you. Dutch! - Monica, Dutch is not here. - Dutch! I bet you don't know where he puts his prescriptions. I was in the hospital today, and Dutch wasn't at the hospital today. - He's not here. - So where is he? You obviously don't know where the doctor keeps his prescription pad, please? - I don't know. - Oh, no, you don't know? - No. - [Monica] Are you sure? - What are you doin'? - Oh, I'm high, and I'm drunk. And I'm drunk, and I'm high. - You need to give me that gun. - I'm tired of giving. All I do is give, give. - Give me the gun. Give me, you know what? - I'm not strong like you. - Monica, please. - You could do it. (dramatic music) - You could kill me. - No! - My heart feels dead. I wanna be dead! - (grunts) Oh! I got the gun, all right? - Don't you understand me, huh? You're so naive! I'm in love with a man who sleeps around! And he knows that I'll never leave. And God has forsaken me! - Monica, you cannot blame God for your problems. You cannot blame him for your problems. - I do blame God. And one day, you will blame God too. At least my husband tells me the truth. Your husband? It's pathetic. - What's pathetic? - Your lie. It's so much more fulfilling than my truth, and that's pathetic. You wanna know where Dutch is, don't you? Oh, I wonder. Hmm, where does Dutch wake up? Oh, Val. It's snowin' outside. Hmm. God has given us another perfect day. (door slams shut) - So you're sayin' that that's how your fingerprints got on the gun? - Val's prints are not the only prints on the gun. You should have found Monica's prints on the gun too. It's all gonna come out in discovery. - Monica's prints were on the gun, but she has an alibi. Now, your client, on the other hand. - The question is not how the fingerprints got on the gun, but what you did with it. - Well, up until this point, I had no proof that my husband was being unfaithful. - What, come on. You've gotta be the most naive woman on this planet. - Naive? - Yes. - I never said I was naive. - You didn't? I am guilty of being naive. - Come on, guys, is this really-- - You keep out of this! - What do you mean keep out? - I didn't say naive. - You just said you didn't. - I know I didn't say naive. - How often do you say what you don't mean? - I didn't mean naive in the way- - Tell me what you mean. - I love my husband! I had faith in my husband! And I had a lot to lose. (upbeat music) - Ooh, that's a nicer piece than mine. - [Valerie] I don't want that thing in my house. What am I supposed to do with that? - Well, I don't need it. (scoffs) I already got one. - Zahara, if you don't put that thing away... You got a permit for that? - Mm-hmm, it's better than mace. You should hold on to this. Around here, you never know. Just in case. - Okay, all right, okay, just stop. Monica came over to my house, and, yes, she was trippin'. Yes, she was high. But, Zahara, some of that stuff that girl said to me, I don't know, it got to me. - Pull over, Val. (upbeat music) (transitions to dramatic music) - You been takin' pictures of Dutch all this time? - Baby, I know how painful this is, but it's time you knew the truth. - For the sake of-- (gasping) - Thanks, Doc. - I'll see you next week. - Thank you. - Baby? What are you doin' here? What's wrong? - Surprise. So you at the office, huh? - I'm always at the office. - Not always. Mm-mmm. Saturday, you said you had an appointment. Here you are walkin' out of a restaurant. I had a business lunch with Kevin, goin' over some clinic finances. Why don't you just ask me? There's a logical explanation for-- - And why are you talking on a pay phone when you got two cell phones except but to keep it off your call log? - My battery was dead. - Both of them? - You wanna check my call log? - I should. Monday, you were workin' out with the guys? - Yeah. - Here you are comin' out of a hotel. And these pictures here with Monica, do you hug and kiss on all your patients? - I was consoling her. It wasn't anything like that. - It wasn't anything like that? Dutch, come on. You think I'm stupid? (cell phone rings) Answer it. Answer it. - Val, you're paranoid, you know. Why don't you take a Valium? - Don't play psychiatrist with me. Who's callin' you? - It's probably a patient. - Okay. Let me see the caller I.D. - Come on, Val. - You sleepin' on the couch. - In my house, the house I'm payin' for? - Okay, you don't wanna sleep on the couch? I'm gonna take Nicole, and we gonna move back to Atlanta. - Well, I guess I'm sleepin' on the couch then. You happy now? - (scoffs) Am I happy? - Val. (sighs) - [Computer Voice] 31st floor. (breathing heavily) - [Simmons] Look, you runnin' out of time. You know, Detective Hicks is being really patient with you. But a black woman on death row doesn't really bother me, not when I have your fingerprints all over the murder weapon. - Yes, my fingerprints are all over that murder weapon but I have not seen that gun in a long time. - Oh, come on, Dwight, what are you doing here? - Mrs. Mass, I am not a patient person. (mellow music) - Jenny, well, I'll have another triple. - Okay. - My son here-- - Hennessy and water, two. - Okay. - Jen, what's a pretty girl like you doin' workin' in a joint like this on a Saturday night? Now, don't you have a better offer? Now, I can offer you a whole range of-- - No, Mr. Mass, I think I already heard that offer. - [Dutch] Sorry, Jenny, you know, he old. Just-- - (chuckles) Son. Now, all marriages have rocky times. I mean, you can know more about what women think than they know about themselves. Now, that can lead to provocatation, but you're just like your old man. You're a Mass man, the last of the Mass men, and God saved the best for last. - I don't know about that. - Yes, yes. Look at your accomplishments. You know how proud I am of you? - Listen, Dad, listen-- - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm! - Now, I brag-- - No, Dad, listen to me. Listen to me. - Now-Now, I want you to listen to- - Dad, listen to me. - I brag to my buddies about you. - There's something I wanna talk to you about. Listen to me, I wanna talk to you about something. - I brag to them all the time. I mean, who else got a kid who's an M.D.? This, this is my son here! This one! Here he is! - That's right. - Here he is! - Sit down, Dad. - All right, okay, okay. - Sit down. - Let me, let me talk to ya. - Come on. - I mean, you been places I could only see. I want you to look at what you've done for your family. They are never gonna be in need. Look at the example you are settin' for your daughter. I am proud of the man you've become. Jenny. Is it something I said? - No. - If I say it to you differently, will you listen to me? - No. - How about if I sing to you, baby? Now that is a hard, cold woman. But I'm not gonna give up. Mass man. What is it you want to ask me, Son? What is it? Come on now, come on, come on out with it. - All right. Well, um-- (chuckles) Man, it's nothin', just anxiety, you know? Just Val and me not gettin' on and... It's nothin'. It's nothin'. - Two young people in love, rich. It's all gonna work out, son, right here. I love you, son. - I love you, Pops. Hey, come on, man, sit down, sit down, sit down. - Mr. Chambers will be down momentarily. - [Zahara] Okay. - Girl, why is my first photo shoot with Ryan Chambers? - 'Cause this is gonna look great on your resume. Trust me, this is good for you. - Good for me too. ♪ Hey, ladies ♪ ♪ What we gonna do about it ♪ ♪ Please tell me again ♪ ♪ Our friendship ♪ ♪ Man and woman ♪ ♪ Somethin' not right about it ♪ Don't be intimidated. I know it's your first time shootin' a star. I won't bite you, unless you request it. - (laughs) Ryan. I have got another appointment, so, I have got to go. - Mm, too bad. - Ready? - Do I look ready? - You always look ready, my brother. Nice suit. - So, this how you want me? ♪ They see, I hate 'em ♪ ♪ Caught back and unwind ♪ ♪ I knew their games ♪ ♪ They don't like me ♪ ♪ They see me hiding ♪ ♪ They don't like me ♪ - Look up, let me see your eyes. ♪ They don't like my money ♪ - Open your jacket a little bit so I can see.

Okay, Ryan, give me, uh, give me a profile. ♪ You see, I hate 'em ♪ - Thank you, I think we've got it. That was great. Thank you so much, Ryan. - But I'm not finished yet. - I think we got some good shots. You should be happy. - No, I got somethin' else in mind. You just keep shootin'. - For real, we got some really good shots. - I'm thinking about using this for my album cover. You just keep shootin'. - All right, but it's your time and your money. (camera shutter clicking) What are you doin'? (gasps) - Mm. How's it look on me? - Yo, give that back to me, please. - Just let me read your palm. I'm really good at this. I think a life-altering experience about to happen in about 15-- - What are you do, stop. Get your hands off me! - Hey! - What are you doin'? - Stop! - What's up, dog? - Dutch, what are you doing here? - What are you doin' here? - I'm doin' a job, it's a photo shoot. - Just stay away from my wife! - It's all good. - Dutch! - No, that's my wife! - It's all good, dog! - You stay away from my wife, you hear me! Stay away from my wife! - Dutch, let's go! - Get your hands off me! What is this, payback, huh? - Payback? Ain't nothin' goin' on between me- - He's standin' over there half naked with a smile. You gonna tell me you ain't tryin' to do nothin'! - It ain't nothing but a job to me. I ain't tryin' to get with that man! - This is your job, right? This is your job? - On my job! - You are a wife, and you are a mother! - Oh, I'm your wife? You rememberin' that now, huh? - That's what this is about, right, Monica, right? Let me tell you something, Monica was just a friend. - Hello, what about your equipment? - I don't give a damn about that equipment. Zahara will get it next week. - This ain't over. - You sayin' that's how the earrings got in the room. - Who leaves earrings when they commit a murder? - Maybe murder wasn't option number one. - Juries want cases that make sense, in case you haven't noticed, and so do voters. Now, I don't know if this is the case that's going to sweep you into office by a landslide. I mean, you haven't convinced me. Has he convinced you, Mrs. Mass? - Felons can't vote. - Supposition on top of assumption on top of pure nonsense which makes it clear to me, and will make it very clear to a jury, that, Dwight, you have got nothing. - And you've got 15 minutes to wrap this up, and then I'm goin' out there and I'm telling the press that we have charged our prime suspect with murder, with or without a confession. - 15 minutes. - [Zahara] So, what do you think would have happened if Dutch hadn't walked in? - This woman is always staring at me. She gives me the heebie-jeebies. - Issues. Issues. - Valerie. - Hey, Charlotte, how you doin'? - I know somethin' about your husband. - And what is that exactly? - Something you should know. - What are you talkin' about, Charlotte? - Loews Hotel, go there now. - What is this? - Room 3118. Please be careful. It could be very dangerous. You are dealing with someone who can be very irrational. - Wait a second, Dutch? Charlotte, how well do you know my husband? - I'm not talking about your husband. I'm sorry, I just think you need to know. - What in God's name? - Charlotte! - [Zahara] Val! - [Valerie] Charlotte! - Let her go! Val, you don't know what you're walking into. You heard what she said. Val, you're not listening to me! Val. Listen to me, I know what I'm talking about. Look. I got this scar when I walked in on my husband when he was with another woman. It got ugly. Real ugly. You don't know, he could be up there with some crazy hooker. - Zahara, please get out of my car. This is between me and my husband, and I'm gonna deal with it myself. - If you're not gonna let me go with you, then you are taking this. You gotta protect yourself, Val. This ain't heaven, baby. There are crazy people out there. You are putting this in your bag, or I am coming with you. - No! - Take it! Or I'm going with you. Thank you. Anything happens, call me, you hear? - Fine, sure. - All right. Get yourself together, all right? It's gonna be all right. (engine starts) You okay? (dramatic music) (people chattering) (dramatic music) - [Valerie] Hi. - How can I help you? - Do you have a Dutch Mass registered here? - Dutch Mass? - Yes. - Let me check. (keyboard keys clacking) No, I don't see that name. - Thank you. - Oh, wait, I do have a Dr. Dutch Mass. Would you like me to ring his room for you? - No, thank you. No, thank you. (dramatic music) (elevator door opening) - [Computer Voice] 31st floor. (suspenseful music) - May I help you? - 3118? - End of the hall. (suspenseful music) (ring clatters on table) (suspenseful music) (shower running) - [Man] (moaning) I missed you a lot. Right there. - You've been working out, huh? Yeah. You've been workin' out. I can feel it. (dramatic music) - Val. I'm sorry. (dramatic music) Okay. Val. Val. I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Val. Val, I can explain. God, Val! Val, I can explain. Val! Yo, I'm sorry. Val, wait. Val, you gotta give me a chance! (panting) Give me a chance! Give me a chance to explain! Val, wait. I'm sorry! No, no, no, wait, wait! No, wait, please! Wait! (Valerie whimpering) Val. - This door's closed. No! Oh. - Listen. Val, listen to me. Val, it's not what you think. - Val, Val, listen to me, come on. Come on, Val. (sobbing) Baby, stop it. Come on, Val, stop. - (sobbing) No! - Come back. - [Security Guard] Do we have a problem here? Ma'am? Sir, sir. - You need to let her go, calm down. Calm down, sir. - [Security Guard] Don't make me call the police. - Hey, Val. Hey, Val! Hey, that's my wife! Take your hands off me! (dramatic music) - How was the church meeting, Ms. Mass? Are you okay? Ms. Mass. (groans) (retching) (cell phone ringing) (dramatic music) Mrs. Mass, is there anything I can do? Ms. Mass, is there anything I can do? - No! (screaming) - Ms. Mass! - No! (screaming) (dramatic music) (knocking) (dramatic music) No! (sobbing) - Explain to me how you went into that hotel room with a loaded gun, and you saw your husband in that situation and nothing happened. - Nothin' happened? Nothin' happened? Detective Hicks, the end of my life happened. Everything I believed in died. My future, my family, my faith, my hope, died in that moment. You can sit over there and say to me nothin' happened? - And that was the last time you saw that gun? - Yes. (knocking) - Come in. We're running out of time. Meet me in the foyer. Five minutes. - Ah, got it. (door closes) When was the next time you saw your husband or Ryan after the hotel? (dramatic music) - What are you doing here? What are you doing here? (dramatic music) I got a question for you, and I want you to answer it honestly. (dramatic music) - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, baby. - Did you use protection? - Mm-hmm. (dramatic music) - Always? (dramatic music) Always? (dramatic music) - No. (dramatic music) (grunts) Val! Wait, wait. I'm sorry. (shrieking) - Val! Val! - Please! (Valerie sobbing) Daddy, stop! Make it stop! - I'm sorry! - Mommy, stop, don't, please. Stop! - Get out! - Go to your room, sweetheart. - Get out! Get out! Come on, Nicole. - Daddy! - Come on, Nicole! - Daddy! - [Valerie] Go to your room! (dramatic music) (knocking) - Val, open up. Val, you okay? Now what is going on? When did you start drinking? - Who's taking care of Nicole? - The babysitter took her to the mall so I could have some peace. - Val, you have got to stop trying to hurt yourself. - Please, please, y'all, leave me alone. - What, alone with your booze? - Yes. - See, you done lost your mind. Girl, we gonna be in your face till you come out of this room. You have got a daughter to raise and a life to live. - I know. - This is not your fault. - I just can't take any more right now. Okay? - Okay. Mrs. Mass, you're gonna make me get violent. That means I'm just gonna have to rip that weave right out your heads. - I don't wear a weave. Oh, you gonna need one after I'm done with you, okay? (snapping fingers) - Okay? Hey, put your coat on. Let's get something to eat, all right? (upbeat music) - I'm telling you, I never saw Ryan that way. And usually my gay-dar is on point. - I have always suspected Ryan the Secret Chambers. - Why didn't Dutch just say he was bisexual? - Because he's not necessarily bisexual or gay, at least not if you ask him. He's just DL, down low. How long would you have stayed with Dutch if you knew he had a thing for men? - One date, half a date. - How do you think straight black men would react to him if he came out? What about his practice? This is not an easy thing. - You shouldn't feel like you're the only woman who ever went through this. - It's not that uncommon. - Oh, I know that's right. Hmm, there are a whole lot of boys who like it both ways. (clears throat) Now check out the daddy with the wife and two kids, mm-hmm. - Be right back. - You kids ready to order? - His wife is right there. - Right there! - Yo, man, that dust in here is crazy. - Oh, really? - Yeah, as a matter of fact, I think you have something in your eye. - Oh, really. - Yeah, you should let me blow it out for you. - Hey, Dad. - Oh, hey, Son. Why don't you come up here and wash your hands? - You did not. - He ain't my type. - You guys, I'm sorry, but-- - [Zahara] Val. - They're upstairs. - Hello, Reverend Dunn, Sister Dunn. What y'all doing here? - [Reverend] Just thought we'd put a few things in order. - No huggin'. No preachin'. - Someone told me a story once about a blind girl who hated herself just because she was blind. She hated everyone, except her loving boyfriend. He was always there for her. She said that if she could only see the world, she would marry her boyfriend. One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her. Then she could see everything, including her boyfriend. He asked her, "Now that you can see the world, "will you marry me?" The girl was shocked when she saw that he was blind, too, and refused to marry him. Her boyfriend walked away in tears, and later wrote a letter to her saying, "Just take care of my eyes, dear." - Hmph. Who am I supposed to be, the blind girl? - You were the blind girl. - Can a blind girl get a drink? Don't preach at me. I already been saved. I am a saved woman. I have prayed and I have prayed. You see these scars on my knees? That's from praying. - Valerie, once you start feeling sorry for yourself, you give away your power. - What power? God ain't listening to me. - Stop giving Satan the glory. - I have been everything God asked me to be. I have been a good wife. I have been a good mother. Every Sunday I make sure I'm in somebody's church, and I take my family with me. I saved myself for my husband. I saved my body for my husband, and I have never, ever, ever thought about cheating on him. And I did these things, not only because I loved Dutch, but because I loved God. - You think you're the first woman who's ever been betrayed by her husband? - I wasn't just betrayed by my husband. I was betrayed by God. God didn't betray you, baby. As Christians, we all have our cross to bear. Jesus is bearing the cross. You gonna make him bear it alone? - It was a man. It was a man! It would be one thing if it was a woman. I could do something about that! I could compete with that. Fix myself up, look cute in his eyes, make myself beautiful for him. But it's a man he wants! A man! - In the name of Jesus Christ, Valerie. Women who struggled through heartbreak, pain, slavery, and they did not do so to see it come to this. Rise up, Valerie because someone is watching you, and that somebody is your daughter. And it's not the betrayal that's important, Valerie, it's the lesson you learn from it. - I can't. (crying) - Yes, you can, Valerie. - Please, leave me alone. Please! - Get up, Valerie. Give God the glory. Get up! Take back your power. - Mommy, are you okay? (dramatic music) - God loves you. (dramatic music) - Yes, baby, Mommy's okay. - Remember what you told me to do every day? (dramatic music) Come on, Mommy. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lay down in green pastures, he restoreth my soul, he leads me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake. - For his name's sake. - Both] Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. - Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou annointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. - Your husband sleeps with mens? - No. - Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord! - Ms. Honeycomb, let's be mindful. - I know I shouldn't say this, but I would have slit his lying throat. Sorry, Sister Dunn, but I would have. - Greg, no disrespect... - but I thinks all you gay, lowdown-- - Mm-hmm. - Down-loaded men is bringing that white homosexual disease into our community. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Spreadin' that AIDS and not tellin' nobody. It's a sin and a shame. And I had to get it off my chest or else I'll bust. - Sister Honeycomb-- - You interruptin' her. - I'm afraid for my daughters. I'm afraid for my granddaughters. Lord, I'm afraid for 'em all, and I'm sorry. But it's your fault for all your secrets and disease. - So what are you saying about my son? - [Sister Dunn] Ladies! - First of all, it's not down-loaded, it's down low. - Whatever. - Secondly, I'm a homosexual man, and I'm proud of that, 'cause I'm not keeping any secrets from anybody, trust me. It's impossible for any woman to get anything from me. - That's not the point. - Sure ain't. - I don't condone what these men are doing! I agree with you! But can you realistically expect anybody to confess anything or to come out if they know this is the reception they're gonna receive, this is how they're gonna be treated? - What about the way they treatin' our daughters and our granddaughters? - I'm not touching your daughters or granddaughters, ew! - My son might be gay, but I love him and he loves me. - What are you talking about, Persons? - What do you mean what am I talking about? I'm talking about my son. - We are talking about Greg. - I thought we were supposed to be talking about Val's problems? - That's right, ladies. We are supposed to be talking about Val's problems. - We are talking about Val's problems, right, Val? - Well, I-- - We sure are. - Heavenly Father. - Jesus. - Listen. Down-low men are only part of this problem. - A major part if you ask me. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, really? What about prostitution? (gasps) Sharing drug needles? Straight men going to Thailand and Brazil on business trips bringing H.I.V. and other things back to their wives and their girlfriends? We're all guilty about something. - That's right. - And by the way, I love God just as much as you do. - But does he love you? - Sister Honeycomb! - Look, God loves me and my son. - Would you be quiet? - Who you tellin' to be quiet, Boo? - Mrs. Persons, would you please, please sit down! We are in church! We're in the house of the Lord. - Yes. - Now, let's all look to God and pray together that he will help Val through this terrible trial and be healed. Now let's join hands and bow our heads. - Charlotte. - Yeah. - How did you know about my husband? - I've been where you are. My husband lives on the DL, too, but when you're a famous entertainer, people cut you a lot of slack. - You're Ryan's wife. - We're legally separated. We have nothing together now. - Well, I just want to say thank you. Thank you so much. I don't know how I'm gonna repay you. - For what? - Opening my eyes. It was difficult to find out that my marriage has been a lie for all these years. But I guess when you don't know the truth, you can't make a choice. - The important thing to remember, Val, is they can't win by telling the truth, and we can't lose by telling the truth. (mellow music) - [Kevin] So what's happening, baby? You coming back to me? Is that it? - No. - Hmm, no? - [Dutch] I'm ending it with you too, Kevin. - So you're a leopard who is gonna change his spots 'cause he doesn't wanna be a leopard anymore? You're DL all the way, baby. You're gonna be back. - Yeah? Can't have your cake and eat it too. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. Your marriage is proof of that. - I think your marriage is proof of that. You know, Monica and I got our thing together. We have an arrangement. It's what's called an arrangement. - Oh, arrangement. - I told you that you need to come clean with your girl, Val. You really do. - What you doin'? - I'm straightening up your tie, and I like that tie. - What are you doing, come on. - I like that tie. - Yeah? Well, like it from a distance, man, what you doin'? I'm not playing with you, man. - I'm not playing with you. - It's over. - Oh, okay, it's over. So you're gonna walk away just like that? Well, I'm gonna be right here when you come back, baby, because Kevin knows who he is. Everyone knows who Kevin is. I am free, Kevin is free. 'Cause you're DL! Go ahead. Are you gonna change your spots? You can't change your spots! You are nothin', baby. Look at him! Look at him, he's a faggot! He's a big-time punk! Sissy. (dramatic music) - Coming clean after I caught you red-handed really doesn't mean that much. - Yeah, but now there's, there's no more secrets between us. ♪ Light of my life ♪ - I love you, Val. We're supposed to be together. I don't want you to leave. - You think you can do what you've done, live a double life, and it's all supposed to just go away? Why, Dutch, why? Why you think that, 'cause you're cryin'? - I can change. Val, I can change, I swear. I swear to God I can change. - I'm sorry, Dutch. I filed for divorce. - (sniffles) This is what I get? This is what I get for being honest? Val, I can't stand the thought of losing you and Nicole. I need you. Baby, you can't walk out on me. - You walked out on me again and again and again. - Admit it. You must have hated them, both Dutch and Ryan. I would have. - Hated them? I wouldn't say hate. I wouldn't say that. - After a betrayal like that? Oh, I know you're a good Christian and all of that, but a jury is gonna have a hard time believing-- - Detective, I can assure you that on that jury there will contain a number of good Christians who won't have trouble believing. Time is up. - There's not much more to tell. - Make it fast. - Ryan Chambers and all that, it meant nothin' to me. Baby, I swear to God. I swear to God, it meant nothin'. It meant nothin' to me. (applauding) - You a hell of an actor, you know that? You sat there and said them same things to me. Sitting at my table. Only you was sitting where she was sitting. - I'm leaving. - Sit your ass down. - Get your hands off me. - Don't you ever put your hands on my wife! - Who do you think you are? - Check it out. - Don't you ever touch me again! - He used me. - Just leave. This is between me and her, just leave. - You lied to us. You used everybody. - We have an emergency. - Good night. - Don't you leave. Just get out. - Let me give you a little something-- - Take your hands off her! - You can tell the tabloids this, okay? Ryan Chambers is H.I.V. positive, honey. - What did you say? - Have you lost your natural mind? - Wait a minute, hold up, stop. What did you say? - Ryan Chambers is H.I.V. positive. - What have you done? What have you done to me? What have you done to me? What have you done to me? What have you done to me? - Bye, sweetheart. Happy holidays. We'll miss you, sweetheart. - Man, I hate you! (patrons gasp) (groans) (sirens wailing) - I hate you, you know that! - Hey, hey, sir! - I'll kill you. I hate you. - Put it down, drop the knife! - I love you, and you love me. - Man, you love yourself. Man, I hate you! - Drop the weapon and step away! Now! I said put it down! - I love you. (knife clatters on floor) Go to hell! - God don't want you. - Don't worry, Mr. Chambers. We have everything under control. - [Man] He just went off. - You're gonna burn in hell for this. - [Man] They were just hanging and talking. - [Officer] Move! - You gonna burn in hell for this, Ryan. - Calm down! - He threw a-- - You'll burn in hell for this! - [Officer] Okay, sir, let's go! I said calm down! - You'll burn in hell for this! - Hey, come on. - You go to hell! (mellow music) - Cute. (mellow music) - [Officer] Open the gate! - Robert Mass? Your bail was posted. - Close them. - By who? - Step out. - Agent Forrester, let's go! (dramatic music) - Thanks for bailing me out, Dad. (dramatic music) - It's true, isn't it? You put your family in danger. You don't put your family in danger. - Pops? (groans) - This is not what Mass men do. - I tried to tell you. (groans) I tried to tell you. You were so proud of me! - Thief! You stole my granddaughter, my family, my life. - You took every single thing I-- - I tried to tell you. So many times. Listen to me. This is who I am! This is Dutch! I'm not your perfect son. I can't be what it is you want me to be! This is Dutch. This is Dutch. This is who I am. This is who I am! This is who I am! (crying) (dramatic music) I don't know why I'm here. - Then get on your knees, and don't get off until you've found the answer. - You judging me? What happened to judge not lest ye be judged? What happened to that? - I'm not judging you, son. I do have a question. Are you saying that what you did was right? - No. I'm not saying I was right. But maybe I did the best I could. - You believe that? How far you think that's gonna fly with the Lord? It's cruel and selfish to bring a possible death sentence to those you say you love for a few moments of lust and pleasure. - You think I don't know that? Yeah. I'm a coward, and I'm afraid. What would have happened if I'd been honest? I'd be called a sinner. A homo. A fag. Do you know how hypocritical that is when you look at the DL brothers in your own congregation? Are you suggesting that the imperfection of the sinners in my church is the reason you betrayed your wife and child? I'm used to people lying to me, son. You're lying to yourself. That's the worst of it. - We both know that if I'd been honest, I'd have lost everything. - I hate to break the news to you, son. You lost everything. Except-- - Except what? - Redemption. God don't hold grudges. His hands is always stretched out to us whether we're riding the chariots of grace or crushed beneath the wheels. He's there. He's there waiting for you. The longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be. But you have to call him. Just call him, son. Call him now. (dramatic music) - [Man] Number 16. Number 16. - Hi. - Hi. - (clears throat) I'm here to be tested. - Take this number, and someone will be with you as soon as possible. - Thank you. - Okay. - [Man] Number 17. (dramatic music) Number 18. - Ms. Valerie Mass, your time is up, and the offer's off the table. - What are you talking about? - You're being charged with first-degree murder. - [Miller] Are you out of your mind? Listen, Valerie, I'll have you out of here in no time. - Detective Hicks, I'm innocent. - I know you don't care a thing about this girl's guilt or innocence. - Get out of my face. - There's a long way between here and conviction, Assistant D.A. And you tell me, where do you think you're gonna be when this case blows up in your face? - The election will be over by then. (dramatic music) (door closes) (dramatic music) - Valerie Mass, Number 225. (dramatic music) - Ladies and gentlemen of the press, I would like to-- Excuse me. I'm sorry. We're going to have to delay this press conference for about five minutes or so. (reporters clamoring) Now this is still a breaking story. - Can you tell us what happened, Mr. Simmons? - This better be worth my while. What exactly is on this DVD? - Well, I've only watched a few seconds, and I already know that you can't go to the press conference without checking this out. This was delivered to the front desk addressed to Valerie Mass. - And who's it from? - To Valerie Mass. A gift from me and my ex. Charlotte Chambers. - Talk. - What do you want me to say? I am who I am. Or if you're watching this- (chuckles) who I was. - What is this? - It's beginning to look like that confession you wanted. - [Ryan] My death, like my life, will be spectacular. What do you do when someone you trust gives you a gift? A disease without any warning? Well, you can't blame me for wanting to share the gift. Yes, I'm sorry. But who is sorry for me? For those of you I might have hurt, what can I say? Be more careful. You never know where the bogeyman is. And those of you who wanna make judgment, hell, it ain't my fault. You want guys like us to be open and honest so you can publicly humiliate us and condemn us. I might be a coward, but I ain't stupid. I will never let you treat me like that, never! I'll play the monster. And I'm just like you. I never thought it would happen to me. And yes, (gun cocks) the bogeyman is for real. (gun fires) - I'm gonna give you more of a chance than you gave me. (dramatic music) (gun cocks) Bravo. - Thank you, Detective. - Captain would be better. - Captain. Well, I am pleased to announce that after a vigorous and thorough investigation, my department has freed an innocent woman who was falsely accused of first-degree murder. Now regardless of my political ambition-- (choir vocalizing) - Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. (choir vocalizing) And lead us not into temptation. For all of us, there is light. But passion without responsibility is not only a self-destructive act but like the godless stone of ignorance dropped in the rippling pond of tragedy. In this day and these times, it can destroy those we love the most. - Charlotte's suicide will not keep her from God's arms. - Thank you. - If a man does not seek humility, humility will seek man. (choir vocalizing) - Thank you for coming. - Are you okay? - It'll be good to be back home again running my own studio. - I just want you to know that none of this is your fault. There's nothing you could have done that would have made a difference. I've been tested and, uh, they didn't find anything. - Same with me. - Val, I told you-- - You know, I've been struggling with this. Was I the friend you needed me to be? Was I the wife you needed me to be? Was I the Christian you needed me to be? And could you have stopped? Could you? - I don't know. - I love you, Dutch, but I can't trust you anymore. (gentle piano music) - Daddy! - Hey, sweetheart. Oh! - I love you. - I love you more. My beautiful girl. - Be good, okay? - Okay. - Okay, go to Mama. (gentle piano music) - All right. (gentle piano music) I love you, son. (gentle piano music) (knocking) - Are you showing the house? - Not now. The Realtor will be here tomorrow. Why don't you come back then? - You hear that, baby? We might have just found the house of our dreams. Hey, um, you mind if I look around inside? It's dusty around here. You look like you got something in your eye. What did you say? I think you got something in your eye. You want me to blow it out for you? Hey. We'll come back and look another day, okay?
