It's mum. DEMONS What is it? It's horrible. - Is it dead? - Yeah, of course. If I find the guy who did this... It's private property, damn it! Look at your shoes. - Why? - They're disgusting. You can't wear them for the burial. I've got some others. Get dressed. You look like a whore. Frank? Is that you, Frank? Why aren't you answering? What were you doing? Looking at mum. - Shit! What are you doing? - I couldn't find a towel. - You broke the shelf. - It wasn't fixed properly. Good thing it wasn't the mirror. Go get me some shoes. I'll cut myself. Come here. I can wear all the little knickers I want. - Why are you saying that? - If we're getting divorced. I'm not strong enough yet to split up with you. It's how it is. Either I kill you or you kill me. Either we split up or keep going like this. I can't decide. You decide. Are you sad? Hungry? Are you tired? No? You like when I do that? That? No. Are you nearly done? I was done ages ago. I'm completely done. Hello? Hi, Jenna. Yeah, great. Thanks. And you? We're staying the weekend. Wait, I'll go see. Yeah, I'm sure... Wait. I think I... It's fine. Yeah, I have a packet. Yeah, yeah. OK. Come when you want. Come here... Come to me. I'm so small. No, you're not small. I am! Of course I'm small. Anyway, I'm bigger than you. No. You're not. Of course I am. You can see. That doesn't count. Don't tread on my feet. Not now. Thanks! That was lucky! I forget everything. Whenever I go shopping, I forget a packet. I only notice when I get home. I think, "What did I forget today?" It's strange. One packet every time. I only realise when I get home. This time, I forgot the rice. Now you've got it. Non-stick rice! Great! Don't you want to come in? No, I have to dash. Thank you. - Who was that? - Jenna. She wanted to borrow some rice. - Are you sure? - You can never be sure of anything. Absolutely. She'd never touch you. Really? She asked me why you touch her all the time. - Are you nervous? - Me? No, not at all. No, I feel fine. OK. Do you think they'll want to eat something? Knowing my brother, he'll have eaten the whole journey. Try not to terrorise him. Excuse me. I tried to touch you. Caress you. I didn't see you do that. It's well timed, this funeral. We'll be able to meet people. Unless you still go to bed with a thriller and some milk. I warn you, this evening, I don't plan to take care of you. My face! My God! Much older. Older and fresher. - What aren't you going to do? - Me? Nothing. Did you see? I put make-up on my incredibly wrinkled piggy eyes, incredibly... You don't plan to take care of me? What do you mean? Nothing... I don't mean anything. Shouldn't they be here already? That's enough! What do you mean by that? Nothing. - Say it or I'm leaving! - I don't mean anything. Oh, go away! Leave if you want. Leave! Come on, let's go! Bring your mother. Watch yourself. No, Frank! No hitting. Don't hit. You look how you always do before you hit me. - What do I look like? - Psychotic. - I'm like that now? - Yes. But you won't keep it up, right? They'll be here soon. I don't intend to hit you. Not now. I'll wait. I'll do it when you're not expecting it. Now, you expect it. But I'll wait. I'll wait until you don't expect me to hit you anymore. Then I'll hit you. Can't we stop arguing, Frank? Can't we stop? Can, we can. But want... do we want to? - What do I have to do? - What you want. What I want? What you want. Is it hard? Yes. Yes, it's hard. Hello? We'll have to manage. But where will you sleep? See you tomorrow for the burial? OK. They're not coming. What? - They're not coming. - Who? Your brother? Why? - They're staying at a hotel. - Why? - He wants to watch the football. - Why? No doubt, he's interested. That's not true. Maybe, but it's what he said. They'll come tomorrow. Can we have a little orgy instead, just you and me? I'm going out. - Where? - Anywhere. I can't stay here another hour, fighting with you. We could invite Jenna and Tomas over. They must be bored. I'll ask them over for a drink with us. Yes, it's Frank. Do you want to come over for a drink? The kids can look after themselves. Whenever you want. We're in. Sounded like they were just waiting for someone to call. - Who did you speak to? Tomas? - Jenna. - You like him, don't you? - Me? No more than you like Jenna. That's what I said. Of course I like her. I think she's cute. You don't think she is? She asked me why you touch her all the time. You already said. Look at me. I am. But you don't see me. - You love me? - You? Yes. Do you love me? Yes. A lot. But I can't stand you. Really can't. I can't stand you. But I can't live without you. Anyone there? Hello! Frank? Well? - How was the rice? - It was for the kids. Nice of you to call. We were watching football. - Tomas' not coming? - Can I use the phone? It's funny you called. What are we going to do? What are we going to do? Be together. I'll call Tomas. I left my phone with Sarah. - She knows how to use it. - Already? It crazy, kids today! It's me! I'm at Frank and Katarina's. Don't forget your phone. And tell Sarah that if she or her brother wake up, they call you. OK? Don't forget to turn off the washing machine. See you soon. Frank? Hi, Katarina! Ooh! It's a party! Oh... The dress? I just threw it on. How are you? It really suits you. You think so? Honestly? Where did you get your shoes? Rome. They're half the price there. Your place is nice. Not much furniture. It's lovely. But on my own, I'd be scared... And Tomas? Is he coming? Yeah, I spoke to him. That way, I won't worry all the time. We didn't want children late in life. But I could never have aborted. Especially when you see what they become. Better to live like a sleepwalker... Could you ever abort? - You want an ashtray? - Thanks. I can't have children. Oh, well don't worry. Some people try for 10 years until they can have kids. And others never do. - Have you tried... - Everything. Held your legs in the air? Oh, life's unfair. Why? Frank's sperm must be too tired. Or he doesn't love me. Now, I don't want kids anymore. It's really beautiful here. I've never managed to do anything nice with the house. Even if I move the furniture... It's pointless. When you have brats leaving their shit everywhere. And we don't bother you? Oh no, not at all! Not that I know of. Not even last week? The shouting, police... Oh... we fight too, you know. Not Tomas! He seems so kind. I'm not complaining. We hardly fight. And then when he's angry, I just tell him, "I love you!" If you say it at the right time, you can't fight. Are you thirsty? I'm thirsty. It's so long since I've spoken to an adult. At home, I have to talk like a child. So when friends call me, I don't know what they're talking about. I talk about Cinderella or Snow White. All my fun is taking out the rubbish, buying nappies or taking Sarah to her gran's. That's why it's great to be sitting here, just simply, without always being under pressure, it's... You don't know how peaceful it is. I could fall asleep. You're so good! For Katarina, it's horrendous. - My mum loves that song. - I think I'd like her. Let's not talk about parents. You can really see the sky here! Really? Do you have pigeons too? It's crazy! It's like in the city. I feel good here. There's everything you need. Post office, pharmacy, supermarket, bar... The RER's not far, the kids can play outside. Careful they don't eat any rat poison. - The kids? - The pigeons. They even put rat poison in the sandpits. It's true. There are two different rat poisons. Either the pigeons slowly shrivel up until they die, or they swell up and explode with a big poof! - "Poof?" - Yes, poof. Not poof! You mean a big pop! No, a big fat sticky poof... That's disgusting! Tell her the rat man, Katarina. - No. - Yeah. Tell it. It was so beautiful the night you told me it, in bed. I said no! Tell the story of the man who's buried in a hole and couldn't move his arms or legs, with a little rat in the hole. A hungry little rat that couldn't escape and it had to eat the guts to get out through the mouth. Tell it. You do it so well. You tell it. I don't remember it. It's about you though. Ah! Here he is! It's Tomas! Tomas! Hi. We were wondering where you were. I was giving the kids a hug. You didn't wake them up, did you? - Take a seat. - Did you forget your phone? - No, no, I have it. - Hi Tomas. Hi. - Did you turn the machine off? - Yes! - We bought one, too. - What model? A little slut. How are you? Fine, fine. I can tell. - You look very well. - You too. I dreamt about you last night! You were tall and kind. At least in the dream. A crazy dream. Dreams are strange, aren't they? What's hidden inside us. I dreamt about this big clock. And my dick... I mean, my penis was on an hour. The big hand was a big razor blade showing 11:55. I don't dream. I don't have the time. Shame! Aren't you cold? Do you have new glasses? No I've had them for... 12 years. Not these ones, the same model. It's back in fashion. They really suit you. So, what were you doing? We were together. Really? Why are you soaked like that? - How many kids do you have? - You know. Two. I can't help it if I sweat. It's since childbirth. I thought, the little... It's a girl, right? - Who? Wolfgang? - Yeah, that's it. - What's he called? - Wolfgang. - No! - Yes. Has he started crawling, grabbing things...? No. Not at all. Maybe he's a little slow. Boys are slower. - Than what? - Than girls. Can't you get us something to drink? Yes, of course. Excuse me. Do you know Frank's mother died? That's terrible! She's in the entrance. - What? - She's in a bag. That's where Frank put her. That's where his little mummy is. No, it's true. Right, Frank? Right? What do you want to drink? I don't know... Tomas what are you having? - Anything. - Whisky? I have a good wine... I'll have whisky. But then I'll be under the table. Don't worry about me. Just leave me there. - And you, Tomas? - I like whisky. My mum always says: "I wish I had the courage to sleep under the rug." What does that mean? Well die, obviously. I've never heard her say that. Well, I don't know... She says it. - For you, Katarina? - Gin, if you're OK with that. - Gin? Again? - Yes, if that's OK with you. But, why? Shouldn't it be? Is it true, Frank's mum is in the entrance? Yes. Tomorrow's the burial in the village. Let's not talk about parents. I don't know what to do with my mum. Don't know what to do with mine either. - I really like your mum. - Really? Yes, I really like her. She thinks you're the sexiest man in the world. But two days later, she wants us to divorce. The whisky's fantastic. Really good. I find all whiskies are the same. No, they're nothing alike. Really? What's with you? You OK? You're tense. - No, not at all. - Yes, you are. Look at your chest. It's going in and out like a piston. Relax, Frank. Try to behave like a normal person. No one's going to bite. You hear? I heard your mum died. I'm sorry. My mum? Yes. Katarina told me. Why did she say that? She isn't dead? Yes. She's in the entrance. You shouldn't have that here. My brother's coming tomorrow. We're burying her. So you mean I won't be coming with you? I'd rather keep her. I can keep an eye on her. She's so small, so manageable. - Want to see her? - Ah no, thanks. It's just a few ashes. Here we go again! - What is it? - I'm going crazy. I shouldn't drink alcohol when I'm breastfeeding. - It's leaking! - "Leaking"? Yes! Oh my! What's it like? Let's see! I have to go to the toilet. What? Nothing! Don't make a fuss, please. I'm not making a fuss. - It's wonderful! - What? A woman with leaking breasts! What do you say, Tomas? It's takes a while for them to look nice again. "Nice"? What do you mean? For them to go back. You know, go back to how they were. We don't want anymore kids now. I just get into bed and she gets pregnant. Tomas! Shit, what's she doing? Tomas! Go on. What do you want now? Tomas! Yes, I'm coming! - Why aren't you coming? - What is it? I have to change. What? You're looking at me like I'm an animal. You are. A tiger! A beast! She got it on her clothes. Could she borrow something? I don't know... Oh yes, Frank's jumper. Otherwise, you'll have to get her something. This is fine. Thanks. - Here. - Thanks. Oh yeah... yeah! How do you say it? "Oh yeah... yeah." And how are you, otherwise? - You know what it is. - No. My life, it's working, coming home, eating, putting the kids to bed. It doesn't go far, you're right. - Tennis? - Yeah. And you? Can we start playing tennis, you and me? You and me? Yes. What do you say? I already play with someone. What do you do? I try to run 10 km every morning. Where? In circles... All the time. Are you angry? No. New painting? Where did you find it? A sale, in Milan. Tomas, come see. - Is it old? - 19th century. - Renaissance plagiarism. - A martyr? - Probably. - And the woman? I don't know... Looks like a whore. - Do you know what you're humming? - No idea. Your Italian whore's song, the one you screwed in Orly. It wasn't Orly. - Gin. - What? We don't have any drinks. Tomas, do you want something else? - Why not? - You sure you're not angry? No. Can you bring us something to eat, honey? Sorry? Something to eat, dear. Oh no no, he's angry. You shouldn't wear cologne like that. It's too ordinary. Wear something else. Really? What? What if every day you were woken up by someone throwing a bucket of shit at your face? Nice dress. - You think so? - Yes Black is beautiful. Yes. I like black. In Italy, it's not unusual to be well dressed. I want to be elegant. - What are you talking about? - You. Sorry... I almost fell asleep. Thanks for the jumper. Oh, I feel ill! Sit down. - I said I feel ill. - What did you say? - You feel ill? - Don't force yourself. - Am I disturbing? - Who? You're really pale. Here, drink some whisky. I've had this for nearly a year now. It's really depressing. When I was expecting Wolfgang and took Sarah to the park... Sarah is Tomas and Jenna's daughter. She was five. Now she's nearly seven. Jenna wants to tell us another story. No... I don't have anything to say. I can always keep quiet. But no, you were telling us something. No, it's nothing special. It's ridiculous. It's not ridiculous, tell us. It's not funny. It happened when I was pregnant. Because I felt so ill, I was sick every morning. And one morning, I was doing what I had to, and Sarah was next to me, she pointed to the other flowerbed, across the street, and said, "That one too, mummy!" I know it's not really funny. Damn, it's funny! Another drink? I'd love one... but what time is it? You look exhausted. Do you want to lie down? Come. Come, sit here. What are you doing after the burial? A film maybe. Have you seen any good films lately? Not really. All I've seen recently is Snow White. Makes you feel really silly. I already told them that before you got here. Really? Well... excuse me. We start to feel a little... - Excited? - What? - What did you say? - Excited. - That's not what you said. - I didn't say that? Katarina? - Shouldn't you go check on the kids? - Why? I don't know! Maybe they're dead. Go yourself. One night, he said he'd let me go to the cinema if I wanted. Let you go? It's not the kids' fault if you don't go out. You think I wouldn't like to go out on my own too? Go, I don't know, to the theatre, see people? I'm never allowed out! I don't care, I won't say where I'm going! Frank said "excited". He's winding you up. If you'd like another drink... Call Sarah, see if Wolfgang's still sleeping. - Where's your phone? - I didn't bring it. - Go see them. - Later. - Go on, I'll stay here with them. - Now? - I'll go for his bottle. - Now, I said! - Try and calm down. - Go now! - Get out of here now! Clear off! - OK! Damn! I'll go! Anything you want! Aren't you cold? He doesn't love me. He never loved me. That's why I'm always pregnant. It's possible. I think you're awful. Both of you. I think so too. You're leaving already? Stay. What's happening? They wanted to see their kids. Wolfgang, right? They'll be back. He forgot his glasses. You're right. You drunk? No, I'm sober. Completely sober. What's your scent? What smells good? Cerruti. Everything's Made in Italy now! Shoes, perfume, paintings... - You still see your whore? - No. - Cerruti isn't Italian. - It's an Italian brand. - It's French. - No. It's typically Italian. I'll get the bottle if you want. I lived on my own in Rome at 17! I passed my Italian neurosis! "Cerruti, for men, 85 %." "Volume 100 ml. Paris." Look at that. See? "Paris." "For men." Paris is still in France, right? - How much is it? - Mind your damn business! Now, you're back to yourself again. It's not Italian! - It probably is. - What do you mean? Brands are often registered in other countries. I don't give a shit. It's not Italian. Do you have to go on like that? Yeah. Linea Uomo is Italian, Abitare is Italian, Domus an Italian magazine, your Foscarini lamps, the Italian painting, Là, Rome, Botticelli, Masaccio, Masolino... All the music you listen to is Italian! I've had enough! I mustn't forget to say goodnight to mum. I think I'll put her where you usually sleep. You look old, Katarina. Look at the line around your mouth. You think you don't need to hide it, but it's a very unpleasant sight. - Why do you go on like that? - You don't know? You don't know? All, yes all, alcoholism comes from the hatred of women. What's that got to do with it? It's how it is. - For women too? - Of course. You always want to win. Always fighting. - Me? - Yeah. And what do I want to win? To be good? - "I've had enough", you said. - Right. - Enough of what? - You. I get it. Women want men who pursue. Women have no pussy. Who look to her for comfort, saying, "I need you. Help me. Comfort me." But you... you can't do that. You're not like that. You... Eh? Would you say, "Katarina, I need you, I feel lonely", even if you are, eh? Would you say it? You see? You can't say it. Even now your mother's dead, you can't come to me. I need a man who doesn't have such terrifying control of himself. I want someone who can crack. There, you won. I don't want to fight anymore. I'm the worst. You're the best. You're much cleverer than I am. You're better with money. Your pussy's better than mine and all that. It's all the same to me. I don't mind. - I want a normal man. - Tonight? Yes. You want a coffee? An espresso? I think I'd like a caffè latte. Would you like a caffè latte"? Damn! I feel like I'm on holiday. It's the atmosphere. We're tired, lazy... We have broken hearts. - What are you doing? - Hitting you. Oh, I can feel it, stop it! Stop it! Don't make a scene, no drama, no erotic drama. You're not playing bitches without masters, tonight. Did you hear what I said? Thank you, Frank. You're kind, Frank. I'm so happy to have met you when I split up with Eric. I promise you one thing: if you existed, I'd kill you. I don't give a damn about you. Nothing you do means anything to me. You're not even a man. You're clinical, right down to your arse. Go change now. You can leave right away. I'd love to know what someone like you feels, when you have your head between your legs. You know, I finally discovered you can fuck with love or fuck without love. I mean fuck you without love. It's what I've been doing these past few years. It's a terrifying experience. Like sleeping with a corpse. That's what you did. A corpse. But now, I want to start living. Now, I want to be alive when I make love. I'm not going to get changed. - How's Ludwig? - Ludwig? Who's that? - Who's that? Your son! - You mean Wolfgang? He's got hiccups. We seem to be in the middle of our 16th break-up. I hope you'll excuse us. - What are you looking for? - My glasses. Seen them? - I saw them. - Where? When you were wearing them. After that, they went out of my mind. There was a dead boar on the path. - Dead how? - Dead. It was killed. Did I leave my glasses here? - Do you have a gun? - No, I don't need one. - You want to eat it? - I don't eat meat. I thought I left them here. Let's go find it. Then we'll get some air. Here, wear this. - What's that for? - For the boar. Haven't you heard? It's dangerous when a boar charges. Go wait for me in the car. Don't touch me. I'm not going to touch you. I'm going out in the forest with mum. I'll be back. - You like pornography? - Pornography? - Yeah. You like it? - No. - I do. - Why do you ask that? Don't know. - You don't like pornography? - No. - Do you like violent sex? - You're too drunk to drive. OK. I like any sexuality if it's violent. I like watching men kiss on the lips. - Didn't find your glasses? - No. Makes sense. I put them in my pocket. You sure it was here? I don't know if I can talk about it with you... can I? - What? - That. What I was trying to say. Can I? Try. Yeah, I try. - What is it? - My heart. - Your heart? - Yes. - What about it? - It's beating. Hear it? - Tired already? - No. What would you say if I get close to you, touched your cock in your pants, eh? Like this, back and forth. Could I get it out and hold it? No? Could I stick my cock in your ass? If I take it out again? Do you ever want that? I love it. It's enjoyable. I could drop it. Don't do that. It's my mum. Have you never kissed a man? Never wanted to? - You? - Sober, you mean? I don't usually drink like that. It makes me strange. Are you drunk now? - Yes. - You want to kiss me? - Kiss you? - You can't kiss me? Look what you did. We're alone here. Go on, kiss me. You're crazy! I'm lonely! I'm lonely! No one sees me! I don't know... I don't know my name anymore! Don't touch me! Or I'll crush you! I'll crush you! Are you scared? Yes. All the time. Of what? Women, mainly. Holding their hands. I can't stand it. Tomas, you don't get it. You don't get it! I feel like I'm drowning. - I want you to kiss me! - What? - Please! - Dirty queer! I haven't seen anyone like you in 20 years. You see, it's like this! My brother and his wife were supposed to stay tonight. My mother's dead! I'm in charge of her ashes! She's there, in the mud! There are some things you don't do! That's enough, let's go home. Shouldn't you find your wife? What do you think she's doing, sitting crying? Is she the type to kill herself or get fatter and fatter? You'll catch a cold like that. Not that long ago, we were there, saying "I love you". A long time ago. We have to split up. I have to go somewhere. I just have to go. Do it. - Where? - To A&E. No, no. No. I think I'll go and speak to Jenna. Yeah, go see Jenna... Go see Jenna! She has enough tits for everyone. What? You'll let her talk about your woman like that? - Aren't you angry? - He knows what I mean. - Really? - Eh, Tomas? Eh, you understand? Go see Jenna then! Nothing will happen! She finds you awful! I'm not going anywhere! It's my house! It belongs to me! Of course. What do you think? Hit him if you want. I don't care. It's over. - Get up! - I'm fine like this. - You're not so strong now, eh? - Get up! Why? Can't you bend down to hit me? I'm no competition. I'm not interested in measuring cocks. Nothing left to do, but measure his dick. Come on, leave him. Let's go. I intend to get out of here. Don't think you'll find peace when I'm gone. Go away so I can clean up and feel good. You won't feel good. You'll die. - Oh yeah, why? - Because I'm leaving you. That's good. Well, hurry up. Tomorrow, I'll move the furniture and I'll feel good. It'll be wonderful... and very clean! Tomas! Frank, it's Jenna. I was just thinking about getting you. We were worried. - Feeling better? - I never felt bad. - Let's drink. - Tomas, I don't want to stay. You'd think Katarina and I were air stewards. Only expensive alcohol! He'll come, don't worry. Don't take any notice. No, I don't want anymore. I just came to get Tomas. I get it, but he doesn't seem to want to leave. Why are you crying? What did I do now? - Can't I stay here? - Why don't you want to leave? - It's a wonderful evening. - Don't try to push me. - You know how it ends. - Sure. - You've had it up to here. - What? - Oh, you're awake! - Did you hear? - You're both strange. - Us? Yes. But not as strange as Katarina. It's a mental illness. She makes me sad! He's starting again. She's crazy. That's the only thing I know. Look at her. It's drama. Wait till she starts playing the bitches. No, no. Tomas is leaving and he's going to bed. We're not used to going to bed so late. I can tell, he's tired. Katarina's used to getting what she wants. And if she's decided Tomas will screw her, your tits won't suffer, trust me, Jenna. What is it, Katarina? Was I mean? You should be careful now. He's still fighting! He must feel threatened. I've listened to you all night. I'm fed up! Tomas, let's go! - Stop, damn it! - What's with you? Don't deafen me. You're not a child anymore. If you want to go to bed, do it, damn it. I don't intend to run away. What do you think? I can still talk about something other than children, who they've played with, their fucking parents! You keep pointing at others. But we're so great! - But no! - But compared to others... You don't know what it's like for me. You have no idea what it's like for me! - I'm scared when you shout. - Of what? Go to bed. Go home. I'll come later. When I want to. If I want to, I'll come. I don't want to go without you. You don't want to go without me, then stay here. Stay here. I'm fed up of you. Well, old boozer? Are we friends now? We don't have any reasons to fight? Is he always like that? - Why are you like that? - Like what? How are we? - He's powerless. - Tomas? - I don't think so. - Frank. Frank's powerless. - How's that? - It means he can't fuck. You know what it is... She has no effect on me. He can't fuck without fantasy. Real fantasies. Luckily he has a lot of money. You'll have even more from your little mummy. We could go to Morocco. There are beautiful boys there. Shut up, Katarina. He wants me to go to clubs and pick up guys and then screw them while he watches. Stop degrading yourself. And you wanted me to get paid. During our 9 years together, I've followed one very helpful golden rule: when he hits me, I don't feel any pain, he does. You're awful. It's awful to listen to you. Can I sleep at yours? I'm the one leaving. I'm leaving you. Only he who leaves will return one day. Wait for me, Frank! - Imagine they come back. - You're hurting me! Damn, it hurts... It's good though. It's OK. My God! What brutality! Yes. I've wanted you all evening. I knew I'd have you. - Really? - Yeah. Oh yes! How many times I've imagined putting my hand up your skirt! - Why didn't you? - Would you have spread your legs? - Would you have spread them? - Maybe. Be gentle with me. What were you like when you were little? - As a girl? - Yeah. Solitary? I was a quiet little girl. Kind, sensible. I managed on my own. I was strange, I always wanted to go to Sunday school, because I heard you got a star. I thought if I had a star, everything would be different. - Did you get stars? - Yeah. I just wanted to have them. Has anyone told you, "I love you"? "I can't live without you"? No. I need to pee. I could be peeing on my mother's ashes. Last night, I dreamt about... I never usually remember my dreams. I don't know why. We were sitting in a room. Her, me and Katarina. Dusk was falling in the room. Something was happening outside. A war, maybe. Mum was sitting opposite me. The other side of the table. A big bag... on her lap. She opened the bag to get something out. But Katarina told her I was... No. That she had to take care of me. She promised to take care of me. Make sure nothing happened to me. She tried to convince mum... I was worth loving. That I had the right to live. And I was talking the whole time. I don't remember what about. In fact... in the bag... mum had a revolver. And as soon as I stopped talking to catch my breath, or think of new stories, her hand slid into the bag and took the gun. It was rising all the time to kill me. But I was talking, I was talking... She had to wait and listen. Not to hear what I was saying, but for the moment when I couldn't go on, when I would shut up. Then she could kill me. I ran to the door. I wanted to slam it behind me and lock it. But it transformed into a soft curtain without a handle. I don't remember what happened after that. Mum! Where are you? Mum! I'm sorry. It's fine. I've dreamt about this for years. About what? I finally get to fuck you, look what happens. Calm down. - Of course you're going to fuck. - No. I'm sick. Of me? That would be good. - What do I need to do? - Nothing. I don't feel good. I don't want to, that's all. I don't want to, that's all I can say. It's not your fault. I don't want to. There's nothing to laugh about, stop it! I can't do it because you want it! You get that? I don't even know you! You love him? - Frank? - Yes. I love him. I know. And I don't understand why. - I'm off. - Yeah, go ahead. - I have to go. - Yes. - What are you going to do? - Nothing. I'm going then. It'll be OK now. Good night. I can't sleep. That's what Sarah would always say, "I can't sleep, mum! "Sing me something, hold my hand." And then she'd sleep. Could you sing me a song? - No. - Go on! It makes me really shy. - I wanted to be a singer. - Really. I wanted to be on stage and sing. Go on. Hold my hand then. - You intimidate me! - No, wait, it's wonderful. I've fallen in love with you. You sing me something now. No... What's this? Tears. Are you crying? Tears of love. You're crying! I'm so happy. Let me cry. Should we marry now... or in the spring? The spring is good. Don't leave me. - What is it, Katarina? - Don't leave me. - Why? - Because I love you. Because I love you. You love me. It's gone. It's... a thing of the past. You don't exist for me anymore. That's not true. We're good together. We belong to each other. We just have to touch each other to feel it. You just have to smile and I've fallen. You just go past the door and I'm happy again, as unhappy as I could be. My darling! I really love this face of flesh, blood and soul. A piece of flesh swarming with worms, like under a stone. It boils... it beats. I'm smitten by you again. A warm, sincere feeling, full of love. I think we'll be OK. Now we'll be together. Suddenly, you bring back love. You said you... you were happy... yesterday. You remember? You can clearly see when you're happy. Ah, it hits me! A paranoid side. Is it... you? Are you happy because you think I'm leaving and so all your problems are solved? You don't need to feel guilty about me, because you don't want to be with me. Another horrible thought. Do you know what you want, Frank? Are you sure you want to live with me? Or do you talk about growing old together because it's charming? Or were you really serious? Today, I really realised that I love you... how much I love you. There's not much of a future in all that, but it's all the future I need. What are you thinking? Nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing. You love me? More than ever. I never stopped. I've never loved you less, only more. What are you thinking? Nothing. - Nothing? - No. You love me? More than ever. I never stopped. I've never loved you less, only more. Subtitles: Eclair Group
