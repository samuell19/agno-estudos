Jacques, Jacques! Come quick! - It's shining! It's shining! - Quick, Jacques! - It's shining in the harbor! - Quick! There, there! You see it, Jacques? - It's shining! - It's a coin. - It's mine! I saw it first! - No, you liar! Okay, I'll get it, but no fighting. We'll split it. You can't split a coin. It's stupid. It's mine. I saw it. He's right. You're stupid. - We'll buy something and split that. - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. Can you stop pointing? I've seen it. I've seen it too. Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman. How is the little Frenchman? Fine. You don't mind if I go instead, do you? No. - If you did mind, you'd tell me, no? - Yes. Good. Roberto. Count. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. - Seven- - Bravo, Enzo! Bravo, Enzo! Whose is it now? You saw it, but I dove for it. - Roberto, how long? - Six. I'll throw it back into the water. You dive, and if you do less than six, it's yours. Bravo. Enzo, I saw the coin first. We split? You can't split a coin, stupido! Is it a coin shining there? It is. It's a coin. I'll get it for you, Father. It will be for the poor. Father? Father? Time to get up, Jacques. Shit. Enzo! Jacques! - You shouldn't dive every day, Papa. - Then you shouldn't eat every day. Don't worry. When I am tired... the mermaids help me out. Hey, have you ever seen a mermaid? No. I've seen them. Don't you want to know where? - Why don't you ask me? - What? Where I saw mermaids. Why don't you ever ask any questions? I'm always the one asking the question. Here we are like two stones. Now I'm talking to myself. Ask me something, goddamn it! Why did my mother leave? Pump. Your mother didn't leave. She went back to America, that's all. It's her home. Women are like that- unpredictable... like the sea. A leak! No! Help!Jacques! No, the water! Water! Help! I can't breathe! No! Daddy! Daddy! What? Stay here, Jacques! Mr. Molinari? Yes. How did it happen? Well, the company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck. So the divers were trying to get at the engine... and the boat just turned over in the current! Look, I fucked up! Look! Can you help? - How many are down there? - There's just one. We're feeding him lots of air, but he's not breathing properly. Hey, you gotta get him out of there fast! Ten thousand. - Lira? - Dollars. Hey, wait a minute. You guys aren't gonna try to hold me up at a time like this. Okay, you tell me. How much would you say a man's life is worth? In my village, we have a saying. How does it go again? - I don't remember. - What's that supposed to mean? Forget it. Force, eh? Since we have a little time, you write that check? - How much longer can he do that? - My brother is a world champion. Sign. Bravo! Bravo! Thanks! Bravo! Hey! Wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait, you guys! Hey! Hey, thanks, you guys. Really. I mean it. You're welcome. Enzo, what you gonna do with the money? Have the car painted. But Giuseppe will do that for $25. Then tell him to wax it too. Enzo, really, what you gonna get? A rosary for Mamma. A dress for Angelica. Get yourself a suit that fits. But most important- Yes? Find me the Frenchman. Find me Jacques Mayol. Bye. Are you Dr. Laurence? No, I'm the assistant. Welcome to Peru. Thank you. Here. - A drink to warm up? - Yes, please. - Tea or whiskey? - Both. Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles? Right. - The insurance person is here. - It's about time. - Johana Baker. - Nice trip, huh? Thank you. It's three weeks since the accident. We're getting a little anxious. Frank, you better get out there. He's about ready to go in. Right. First dive, two minutes. Who- - Who is that? - Mayol. Jacques Mayol. Those are your experiments? Dumping a guy in a frozen lake? The truck fell into a very deep crevasse. We weren't able to rescue the equipment. I'll have to talk to the driver. In the spring, when he melts. You really send him under the ice? He isn't a slave or a convict or anything, is he? My dear, science is a cruel mistress. - How is he gonna breathe? - He isn't. Listen. That's the sound of his heart. Can you hear the speed at which it's slowing down? That's incredible. He's in the fluoroscope now. Listen to his heartbeat. I can't believe that. All the blood is concentrated in his brain. It doesn't even feed his limbs anymore. That's a phenomenon that's only been observed in whales and dolphins... until now. Why is he doing this? I don't know. Shouldn't someone take him a blanket or something? Coffee? - I know you. - We just met a few minutes ago. In the lake. No, in the hut. Then it must have been someone who looked a lot like you. Thanks. There's not a lot of time. It's a present. Thank you. You're not gonna open it? - You here for a long time? - No. - Where do you live? - New York. Well, it's been nice meeting you. It's nice meeting you too. I'll only be five minutes. Clown. It's a llama. Darjeeling. I missed you rascals. Jacques, my friend. How are you? Enzo? I leave you swimming, and 20 years later you're still in the water. What the hell are you doing, training? Yeah. Good. Check out the suit. Looking good, no? - You know I am the world champion? - Yeah, I know. The world championship starts in ten days in Taormina. Be my guest. Your ticket. Why? Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me. You're the best, Enzo. See you there. Come on, let's go, let's go! Go park in Jersey, you asshole! Come on, come on, come on! I gotta get movin'! I gotta make a livin' here! Oh, God. Shit. I changed the lock, you son of a bitch! Sally! It's me. - Where have you been? - Peru. We were burgled. They got the television set. They got the new stereo. They got the ring my grandma gave me. I hate New York. I hate this apartment. - I hate you. - How was your trip? It was nice. It was- It was interesting. It was cold. You got a picture of him? Matter of fact- What the fuck is that? It's his heartbeat. I'm gonna make some coffee. They left the stove. He had the most beautiful eyes. It's funny. It was like a fairy tale. You know the French. They're very romantic people. He's not French. He's American. His mother's American. Haven't you been listening to anything I said? Yeah. I've been listening all night. It sounds like you're in love. But everybody knows there's no such thing as love at first sight. You ate all the ice cream. This is good. This is very good. Very, very good. Very good. Unfortunately, it's incomplete. - Johana. - What? - Am I boring you? - No, of course not. Definitely not. What did you say? I said that this file is incomplete, okay? Why don't you go back to Laurence and get the registration? Okay? Don't let him tell you it's in the glove compartment. - That guy was really frozen? - Like a Popsicle. They're keeping him on a stick till spring. Glad I didn't go. I can't hear you! I said the snowmobile papers are in the glove compartment. Yes. Listen, just get the customs office to send me a copy as fast as possible. We can't get you new equipment until our file's complete. All right. You'll have them by the end of the week. Great. You've made me a very happy insurance person. Thank you. - All right. Good-bye. - "Dr. Laurence?" - Yes? - You don't happen to know... how I can get in touch with that diver of yours, Jacques Mayol? The last I heard, he was in Taormina... at the World Diving Championships in Sicily. Sicily? Duffy? We've got big problems in Sicily. - What do you mean? - Oh, God, the Mafia. The Mafia. The Cosa Nostra. De Niro, Coppola, Pacino. I mean, I knew it. - We shouldn't have written that policy. - What happened? - The documents are forged. - No. Yes. The notary is a phony. He's got the same signature as the contractor. - That can't be true! - Well, it is. We gotta send someone there immediately. If we prove the forgery, maybe we're off the hook. There's a plane in four hours to Rome... and from there it's a short trip to Sicily. I'm gonna call Cordoza. He's gonna get us out of this. No, I called him. His son is being bar mitzvahed tomorrow. - Oh, damn his son! - I'll go. - You'd do that? - Yeah, I'll go. Thank you. I thought it was Spanish you spoke. Italian is practically the same thing. Thanks a lot. Mayol, Mayol, Mayol. No reservation. - Are you sure? - Positive, sir. - This is the Hotel San Domenico? - It has been so for 127 years. Be careful with that car. It's a new paint job, okay? Contessa. Giacomino, my friend, my brother! So you finally decided to join us. You did the right thing. You remember my little brother, Roberto? - Hi. - Hi, Roberto. - What room have you got? - I haven't got one. You don't have a room? Paolo? What did I just hear? I personally call you to reserve a room for my good friend... and you treat him like a stranger. - It's okay. I'll go somewhere else. - Not only is Jacques Mayol... a very special friend... but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! And you throw him out! Are you crazy or what? Drop it, Enzo. I'll find something. Take mine. I'll take the countess's suite. She told me she was leaving for the cemetery. She'll be more comfortable there. I'm glad you're here. So after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask me. - Am I right? - Yeah, sure. Lots of questions. Well, what are they? I don't know how to ask the questions. - You married? - No, no, no. Me neither, because of my mother. She's a curse, my mother. Tornado. Stubborn as a mule. I was engaged for a week. After that, Mamma was so mad, the pasta was bouncing off the walls. So not married. Good for you. You play the field like me. A girl in every port, huh? - After all, we're men. - Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish. People say that? Forget it. I was joking! I'll bet you my watch that she's in my bed tonight. Hello. - Hey, you know each other? - Yes. Enzo Molinari. This is a great pleasure. Johana Baker. Nice to meet you. This is a coincidence. It's unbelievable. All the way out here. It's incredible. I can't believe it. Uh, would you like to sit down? Yes, thank you. - I'm not interrupting anything, am I? - No, not at all. Emilio. - You staying at the hotel? - No, they're all full. But they recommended a pension in town. They say all of Taormina's full. It's the Free Diving World Championship. I am, by the way, world champion. - What are you doing in Sicily? - An insurance investigation. I decided to take a few days off, see the island. There is no place in the world more beautiful than Sicily. A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated... - traveling insurance agent. - Oh, no, thank you. - Just a coffee. - No, you should try it. It's good. - Okay. - As I was telling you earlier... I am the world champion free diver. Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world. One has to admit when you see those men diving head first... in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort- - What? - Mamma. She'll kill me if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant. - Bullshit. - Eat. Mamma! Mamma, Roberto and an elevator- Isn't that enough? Coffee only. I'm diving tomorrow. You remember little Jacques? Jacques Mayol. His friend, Johana. She is beautiful, no? Spaghetti del mare. Thank you very much. I'm so hungry. Good. This is it. It's great. So you're going to be really busy these days, huh? I don't know. Why? Because I- I don't know. I just thought- You're- The competition. Interviews. A competition like this requires a great deal of concentration. Doesn't it? Yeah. You can put down the bags now. Thanks. We have to get ready for the ceremony tonight. The Tahitian is the new world champion. I'm tired. I don't feel like it. Roberto, the jacket. - This one? - Yes. Very good. What about the shoes? Very chic. - You don't have anything else, do you? - No. Then it's very chic. - Hi. - Hi. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. Mr. Andre Bonnet... President of the International Diving Championship Committee... is going to present this trophy to the new world champion of free diving. This afternoon our new champion descended... to the remarkable depth of 310 feet. A one-day hero. Mr. President, "if you please"- A new world record. That's great. It gives me something to beat tomorrow. - You ever been to Tahiti? - No. I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish. We'll make love under the coconut trees. How about you do the cooking? - And you forgot the hula. - Excuse me. He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby who just learned to walk. - Have you known him long? - Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece when we were kids. What was he like when he was little? Little, very little. That is, compared to me. I get it, Enzo. You were a superior child. Exactly. What is it, Johana? You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth. Don't think of Jacques as a human being. He's from another world. And just what world are you from, Enzo? Okay. And now, my friends, you are invited for a drink around the swimming pool. Today at lunch you asked me if I had any questions. Ah! You finally want to know about women. Are they what's most important? No. It depends. Sometime they are. What exactly do you want to know? Everything. Everything about what? About everything. So between Mamma, Roberto, and Alfredo, we yell and scream all day long. Except with Angelica. She just cries. And then, finally, we all end up kissing. Can you explain that to me? Huh? Because that's what love is all about. It's a pain in the ass... but it keeps us together. A large... and beautiful... family. - Enzo. - Yeah? We gotta quit this competition. Why? Because if we don't I'm gonna beat you. Do you hear that? What? He looks me in the eye like some fucking goldfish... and says, "I'm gonna beat you." Oh, my God. Hmm. That's what you guys are here for. Listen to her. That's what he's here for. He's here to lose. That's what he's here for. First of all, I am unbeatable. Second- - How old are you? - Two years younger than you. As I said, second of all, you're too skinny. You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick. The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it. "The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it." How long can you hold your breath? Longer than you. We'll see. Hey! Take it easy! Jesus! Thanks. What are you, nuts? - Let me help you with this. - Who won? Won what? The asshole award? It was a tie. Acting like a pair of two-year-olds. You could have died in that pool. Stop moving. You're rocking the boat. Luckily, I was there to save you. My wallet. It's here. No, no, no. I want to show you. Give it to me. Sit down. That's my family. What kind of man... has such a family? It's okay. It's all right. All the medics are looking for you, Enzo. I am meditating. Can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down! I can have a five-minute nap! Mr. Molinari... I'm sorry, but you cannot dive in this state of exhaustion. What do you know about this? Nothing. So you just take your tubes and your tin cans away. The sea is mine. I know when she is ready for me and when she isn't. And today she's ready. You dive at your own risk. Bravo. One minute. Three, two, one. Your pants are too big for me. Where are they? Thank you. Where is everybody? They're gone. Something's wrong. You can't do that. What's the matter? I don't understand. We've tried for two days. They won't eat. They won't perform. It's since we got the new one. It's finished for today. She's the new one. How can you tell it's a female? The way she moves. Help! Jacques, help me. Help me up. Help me- Don't be sad. I only took back what was mine. Here. A present. Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8:00 in my suite. Mr. Roberto, tell your brother to be reasonable. Everybody's waiting for him upstairs. He can't. He's indisposed. - Shall we call a doctor? - She's trying something. Oh, Mr. Mayol, help us. He refuses to receive his medal, and everybody's waiting for him. - I'll do my best. - That's very kind of you. - It's Jacques. - Jacques! My friend, come on in. Mr. Molinari, allow me to impress upon you... the importance of your attending the award ceremony for the press. I think my brother told you I was indisposed. That should do it, no? I am allowed to be indisposed. Right? So you just go tell the press that the big Enzo Molinari... overwhelmed by his inspiring descent of 324 feet... will not be able to receive his trinket because he is- - Hmm? - He is- - Indisposed. - "Brava." - Jacques, my friend! - Why don't you go pick up your medal? Because pasta should be eaten al dente! Let me know how you find it. Yes, I'm still here. I can hardly hear you. Almost everything is almost- Yeah. Two, maybe three days. But, um- No, I'm in a restaurant. What? Okay, I'll call you back. I promise. Tomorrow. Okay. Okay. Yes! My office in New York. It's really busy back there. I have so much work to do. - Is it good? - You want some? Ah, no, I'm- Thank you. What's the matter? I have to ask you a favor. We're not stealing a dolphin, huh? No, I told you, we're just helping one out. Trying to help one out. Yes. Good. Yeah. Stairs! You can stop that now. She has all the water she needs. All right, we did it. Let's go back to the party. Five minutes. That's all, okay? Well, then, good night. Good night. - Good night, Jacques. - Good night. You don't need a stretcher to take her with you. - You know that? - What? The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes. Jacques, can I come watch you dive tomorrow? Yeah. Good. You really do have a few things to learn about women. What do those guys do? They are paramedics. They wait at 200 feet. And him? That is the diver who goes below 300 feet. He dives with a helium oxygen mixture. Compressed air is too dangerous. Three minutes. It's fantastic! Three hundred and sixty feet, yes. Congratulations, Jacques. It's wonderful, wonderful. I'm happy for you. Here. Here. - What is it? - A little present. Nothing much. I knew it. I just knew it. - You still collect them? - Mm-hmm. You don't have that one, do you? No. It's beautiful. Thank you. It's nothing. I knew it. I told Roberto, "He's very good, that little Frenchman. Very good." Is this a poem? No, it's a recipe for spaghetti "frutti del mare." Thank you. You see I was right in getting you out here. You are world champion, my friend. It's a measuring tape. You see? This is your record... three feet more than mine. Looking at it from here, it doesn't look like much, does it? Keep your little measuring tape, my friend. It will be a nice souvenir when I beat you next. God. Did you have a nice night? Yeah. I was with the dolphin. - All night? - Yeah. - With a dolphin? - Yeah. I got to get back to New York. I have my job, I have my work. I have a life. Will you take me to the train station? If you're ever in New York, give me a call, okay? Can I come in? No problem. I enjoy talking in my sleep. Wake me up at 11:00. Why are you always talking? You think people are interested in what you're talking about? I'm not interested and other people aren't either... so just stop talking because other people have things to say. You understand me? Stop talking. It's bullshit! - She's gone? - Yes, she's gone! Hey, I'm gonna take care of you. I've got a job on an oil rig. No sweat. I'm taking you along. Okay? Come on. Get your bags packed. You're coming with me. You stupid bastard. We'll make a great team, the two of us. You'll see. Okay? One hundred feet. You're still thinking about her. Don't think about her anymore. There are so many women in the world. Plenty of women everywhere, right? Smoking is absolutely forbidden. It isn't lit yet. You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board. Listen, we're not supposed to piss either... but that doesn't stop you from carrying it on board. The rules are the rules. - What's your name again? - Noireuter. And where did you say you were from? Brussels. Two hundred. I was 17. I loved her so much, I tried to die for her. Two years later, I couldn't even remember her name. Let me tell you... time erases everything. I don't want to erase anything. Four hundred fifty feet; end of descent. You have enough air for 15 minutes. What's with the voice? It's nothing. Maybe the helium is up too high. Does the voice come back? For others, yes. For you, who knows? Try speaking to me. I don't find this funny. We were having a serious conversation. It's okay for the helium. Here, give me your finger. Is that alcohol? That's really forbidden. Do you have any other complaints? Just make a list, and we'll stick it on the porthole, okay? - Suck your finger. - Stop kidding around. It's dangerous at this pressure, alcohol. Enzo, it's very deep down here. Come on, suck your finger. I will be seeing mermaids everywhere. A thousand commanders, and we get the Belgian from Alcoholics Anonymous! See? Come, let's go. Hey, let's go. - Enzo, where do I put my feet? - Okay. Wait, wait, wait! Where do I put my feet? Can you hear me? I didn't get the fucking commercial. So, did you see your therapist? - Yeah. - What did he say? He said I have a decision to make. The answer is within me. - You paid for that? - Yeah. What did you decide? Nothing. Jesus, Joey, you're driving me crazy with this already! I mean, you don't even want to go shopping anymore. You don't want to talk about my career no more. You don't want to do anything that you used to want to do. All you want to do is talk about this guy that you don't even know! Just make a fucking decision! Okay. Heads, stay. Tails, go. Okay? - Stay. - Good. Bad, very bad. We weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anyone, except you. I know you think I'm a terrible person. I'm not a terrible person. I fell in love. I mean, I really fell in love. Do you understand? I understand I could have you arrested for fraud. I'd be happy to pay you back, but I just don't happen to have the money now. - If you dock my salary $20 a week- - Don't be cute, Johana. I guess this is where you fire me. - You're right, you're fired. - Thanks. All right, who is this guy? This lucky guy? Remember Laurence in Peru? It's one of his divers. - The Popsicle stick? - Yeah. No, it's a different guy. Well, I'm happy for you. Good luck. Hello. Jacques? It's Johana. How are you? Good. I got fired. I got this job with Enzo. We got fired too. Really? Strange. Talk to me some more. It's hard, you know? I don't know what else to say. You're so far away. Tell me a story. A story? Do you know how it is- Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid? You go down to the bottom of the sea... where the water isn't even blue anymore... where the sky is only a memory... and you float there in the silence. And you stay there... and you decide that you'll die for them. Only then do they start coming out. They come and they greet you and they judge the love you have for them. If it's sincere... if it's pure... they'll be with you... and take you away forever. I like that story. What is it? I think I love you. - You live here? - Yeah, sometimes. - Who's that? - That's my Uncle Louis. - I can't get him out of the bathtub. - Sorry. Assassin! Uncle Louis. - This is my friend, Johana. - Hi. Johana is visiting me. He's a bit deaf. He's 75. It's very nice to meet you, Uncle Louis. So, where are you from, Henrietta? Johana! New York! New York? What kind of name is that? No, I'm from New York. Oh, yes! The best lays are from New York. Uncle Louis... Johana is my friend. She's come to stay with me... for a while. Good. That way, I'll see more of you. - Where are you gonna stay? - Here. Here? In my apartment? It's my apartment. Liar! Thief!. Torturer! Uncle Louis, go back to your bathtub. I'm going to put a lock on the telephone. Have some more wine, Uncle Louis. Thank you, Henrietta. I'll change my name. This is, uh, my room. Enzo phoned. He's coming over next week for another competition. Great. Are you gonna compete too? Yeah. Are you sure you'll be all right here? It's not like him to be late. Of course, sometimes he doesn't show up at all. - Remember in Capri- - Two dollars? You didn't even need to catch the fish! It died of cancer! Where did you get that? "That"? This is not a that. This is Bonita Mariposa, the famous Spanish actress... who is going to be very careful with the varnish... Hello, darling. and who has come to spend a few days with us. - Hi. - I'm Bonita. - Nice to meet you. - Where is Mamma? You have eight hours before she gets here. He's really going totally deaf. I'm not as deaf as you are blind! You take care of your eyes, and I'll take care of my ears! I'm sorry, Uncle Louis. Come on, drink up, my boy. - Hey, tell me, what century is this? - Second. I'm glad you're here. Thank you. What's going on here? We're just listening to some musicwith Enzo. Come on in. This is Dr. Laurence. So you must be the famous Enzo Molinari, huh? In the flesh. I have that honor. Yeah. God, I'm getting wrinkles. Mm-hmm, and I'm getting pimples. - Are you gonna live here permanently? - I don't know. Things have happened so fast. We haven't even talked about it. You're very much in love. I can tell. Yeah, I am. You have that look. The look of a woman who wants a baby. Baby? No. I haven't even thought of having a baby. I mean, really, God, we're just... starting to get to know each other, and it'd be really- Do I really? Well, maybe he's not quite ready... but he's a nice guy, sensitive. Well, can't have a baby by myself. Why not? I have a baby. I loved his father. We're not together anymore, but I have his baby. In the end, you do it alone anyway. Enzo Molinari for classification. Yeah, "ciao." What was his last time? I don't know, but it was really long. Hey, that's not bad. Bravo, Enzo. Magnifico. Bravissimo. Very good, Enzo. Very good. So what? Anybody can have a bad day. Well, I've had many, when the sea doesn't want you. It's never the sea. It's Mamma, Roberto, that stupid actress! Don't break my balls. Anyway, I have something to tell you. - I'm pregnant. - "You're kidding!" I knew you were gonna do that! Because- No, I'm kidding. No, I wish I was. Because. I'll call you back tomorrow, okay? No, I will, I promise. Did you have a nice day? Enzo had a bad day. Did you dive? Nah, it didn't feel right. It's a cute baby, huh? I love that baby. My brother! Bravo, Enzo, bravo. Let them try. Is he okay? Okay. Yes. - What are they doing? - I don't know. Not good. Good dive! How was it? It was dangerous: 380 feet... 4 minutes and 50 seconds under water. Great. Congratulations! Thank you. Thank you very much. Bravo, Enzo! Now- Now- I'm sure you've heard that some people suggest... it is too dangerous for us to continue. Dangerous because we don't know how to measure... the physiological consequences of this type of dive. Also because the scuba divers are not used to going down below 300 feet. But we asked the free divers... and they all insist that the competition continue. Good luck to you all. Good luck. Sir- One minute. Three, two, one. You're going past here? Do you see him? Hey! Do you see him? Move up! Bravo, Jacques. Bravo. Thank you. Here. Four hundred feet. Four hundred feet! That's fabulous. You all right? I'll be right there. Hi. Come on in. No, I wanted to say good-bye. - You're leaving? - Yeah. Could you please give this to Enzo? Okay. It's no use. Just tell him I said good-bye and give him a kiss for me. Okay? - Promise? - Promise. Maybe you shouldn't give up so easily. Here's a present for you. It's your baby. Yeah. Believe me, it will change your life. Only for the better. You take care of yourself, Johana. - You too. - Bye. Thank you. Welcome to Greece, Jacques. How are you? Welcome, Johana. Have a good trip? Okay, let me give you all the information. Come with me. The smell of fish is making me sick. Why? Would you get me a glass of water? Are you nervous about the competition? What's it feel like when you dive? It's a feeling of slipping without falling. The hardest thing is when you're at the bottom. Why? 'Cause you have to find a good reason to come back up... and I have a hard time finding one. Well, we have the same problem. Why? Because I have a hard time finding a good reason to stay. I found one. - Is he here? - Yeah. Good. It scares me when you look at the sea like that. I used to dive here when I was a boy. I have something I want to talk to you about. Not here. Okay. Can we talk here? Let's talk about my world. My world is you. I love you. I want to live with you. I want to have a baby with you. I want to have a house with you. A car with you. A dog with you. You know? Jacques, I think I might be pregnant. Did you hear me? God. Tomorrow is going to be a big day. When I analyzed the data from Mayol's last dive, it became apparent... that at the depths these men are diving... it is a physiological impossibility... that they can retain enough oxygen in their blood to make it to the surface. The pressure is so strong... that it stops the oxygen from circulating through the body. To attempt to break Mayol's record now is simple suicide. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. But today's just training. - Molinari's a 17-time world champion. - Three minutes. Do you want to tell him now he can't dive? Cancel the competition. Two minutes. Get Mayol in here. One minute. They want to cancel the competition for a while. Why? It's not safe, they say. The doctors say... we can't go deeper and survive. You say that because you have the title. No, I would never cheat you. That's very nice of you. Oh, Jesus! I told you to tell him not to go! It's not my fault. I told him. - No, no, no, no! - And then they die! Wonderful. Get away! Will you get away? Goddamn it! - Get away! - Get out! Give him some time. Just leave him alone! Get out! Clear off!. You were right. About what? It's much better down there. It's a better place. Push me back in the water. No, I can't. Take me back down. Please. Oh, look! - Up with the arms, over the top! - Come on, Jacques! Let's get a heartbeat. Come on. Come on, Jacques! Come on, Jacques. Come back, Jacques! Come on! Jacques, stay with us! Good. Good. Good boy. Good. Got it? Very good. Here. Better to sleep. We'll talk later. You sleep now. I love you. Dr. Laurence, this just arrived for you. I wasn't on the boat. The only time in 20 years... and I wasn't on the boat. I must go now... tell Mamma. I know this isn't a good time for this, but, uh... I have the results of your test here. Yes, you're pregnant. Are you happy? - Yes. - Good. I'm happy. I'm scared... but I'm happy. So, no more ouzo. No more cigarettes. You take care. - Thank you. - All right. God. Laurence! What is it? Talk to me. Dr. Laurence!Jacques! Okay, wait a minute. Let's talk to Laurence. What are you doing? Please, please, don't do this. Look, don't do this. Why are you doing this? What- Jacques, just talk to me. I've got to go and see. See what? There's nothing to see, Jacques! It's dark down there! It's cold! You'll be alone! And I'm here! I'm real! I exist! Jacques, I love you. Jacques, I'm pregnant. Did you hear me? Go. Go and see, my love.
