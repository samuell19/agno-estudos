Tomoya, take this. This is it. Didn't you say 'log house'? 'Japanese-style log house,' I said. The rent's a third of a condo in the city. I'll bet. We're living here? That's right. THE HOUSE IMP Wow! This is great! Really something, huh? It's got a strength born of years standing up to blizzards. They say it's all of one or two hundred years old. It's been fixed up. By the foreigner who lived here. It looks like he put lots of money into it. Didn't you say you'd always wanted a kitchen like this, Fumiko? That's a real hearth! That's right! What's this? You can catch fish and fry them here on a spit. Come this way. Isn't it huge? You slide the doors closed, 'schwoop'! That's your room, Grandma. And this is our room. Now follow me. I thought we could use this as the living room. And my room? The kids are upstairs. 'The kids'? You said there was a loft. Japanese-style. A loft? This is a loft? Wow! Why's this shrine here? I think it belonged to the original owners. But look. It's empty. I'll take this. Azumi! Isn't this like a dream compared to how jammed in we were in Tokyo? Look at this. Great view, huh? Tomoya! Don't run on the stairs! What? Did you bring that? No, it was here. Leave it where you found it. Is someone living here? Don't be silly! We're going to live here. The Takahashi family. Hey! What's this?! What's wrong? I could fall in! What would a flush toilet cost? 5 or 6 hundred thousand. Go away! Fumiko, you always said you wanted a garden. Look here. You can plant all you want. I want to garden, not farm. What's wrong with farming? Mom used to do farm work back home in Nagano. Doesn't this take you back? I guess so. Natural gardening should be good for Tomoya's asthma. I don't have that any more. It came back last winter. That's right. There's the truck. Sorry to keep you waiting. Thank you for coming. I'm all unpacked. Huh? Cold noodles. I'll cook starting tomorrow. This is dinner today. Bon appétit. Hi. Just pass noon. It's a lot bigger. Everyone loves it. Mom has her own room. Sure. It's my sister. Hello, Haruko. It's been a while. Yes...six months after she came to us, and Mother's had to move again. No, no, it's no trouble at all. Just a minute... She wants to talk to you. Hello? Mother's just gone into the bath... All right, then. Goodbye. That's smoky! All that smoke! That's too much wood! Grandma, that's great! Now you put the wood in. 'Dad'... Why didn't you use your camera when you first came to see this place? It wasn't working. If we'd seen pictures, we'd have said no. I just wanted to surprise you! You cheated us. Don't say that! This was the only place big enough for the rent we can afford. I like it. Who asked you? Azumi, stop it! There's something outside! A raccoon dog? Something weird! A place like this is bound to have ghosts. That's right. Thanks for leaving. Fake tears! Shinoda Station Nichiei Foods, Morioka Branch Don't let this get you down. It's not a demotion. Morioka's nice. 'Morning. Takahashi's come from head office to be Sales Manager. 'Takahashi'. The Sales Director... I'm Marugame. Hello. I'm glad to meet you all. To Azumi from everyone in Grade 9C. Shinoda Middle School OK, everyone! Take your seats! This is Azumi Takahashi. She's just transferred here. From where? From Tokyo! From Tokyo?! You're going to be classmates, so make her welcome. So let's hear from her. Yes, sir. I'm Azumi Takahashi. I'm not very fast, but I'm not bad at swimming. I like listening to music. Uh...nice to be here. Hey! What's so funny? A house imp! Wow! A horse! Look, Tomoya! Hello. We've just moved into the house with the thatched roof. You're our closest neighbor. My name's Takahashi. This is for you. Thank you. You're in school? Grade 5. So is my daughter. He's not going to be starting till second term. How's the house? Well... There was a foreigner in it before. How long did he live there? A year or less, they say. He left quite suddenly. When he'd fixed the place up? Why? I don't know. He was a nice man. Ow! What's wrong? I got a splinter. What are you looking at? Nothing. There! I got it. How was school? Do you want to come shopping? No. Come on, Mr. Takahashi! Relax. You want to turn that. It'll burn on you. So you were in Product Development? Yes. What products? 'Another Splash of Goodness' and 'Wasabi Tofu Pudding". The pudding? That one was a flop! Sorry about that. So now I'm in Sales. I hope you'll all show me the ropes. Well, I guess you start with cold calls. Places like JOIS. We used to deal with them, but suddenly they cut us off. It'd be big for the company to get them back. I'd love to try. The main store's manager is the key. They've got 11 outlets in the city and dozens through the region. They'll all follow him. Here... Excuse me. Where's the washroom? To your left. He's into it now! Look out! But starting him with JOIS? Why not? Give him a high wall to get over. He asked to learn the ropes. But why is someone from Product Development out here? That weird curry took them more than two years to finish. The oysters? No, the persimmon curry. And then the wasabi tofu pudding flopped. So they shipped him out? It looks that way. I'm home. Hi! I hate this helmet! The rules say to wear it when you ride to school. And this jersey! This one? it's perfect for sports. Softball? No, it's like a uniform they wear on the way to school, too. That's practical. I'm back. Welcome home. Hey, could I play soccer? You know you can't! Oh...what about money? Go to the bank. There's no bank out here. Only the post office. We'll start an account there, then. I'll take a bath. No hot water. Mom couldn't heat it up. You should've asked Grandma. She's good at that. I got it burning right. I went to see why it wasn't heating, and the wood was all pulled out. Why? I don't know. Well, I didn't do it! I didn't say that... Are you stupid? It was the ghost! Of course! Why didn't we think of that? About Azumi... What? She tore up the card her classmates in Tokyo gave her. I was wondering if something had happened there. Like what? Something to upset her. Will this work? For her? For us. Even in our little apartment we were all going our separate ways. In a big house like this, it's like we're even further apart. Maybe we're best off not worrying about it. Mr. lvai? No, he's over there. My apologies! I'm from Nichiei Foods. My name is Takahashi. I've just been posted here so I thought I'd come and meet you. How long ago? A week. What took you so long? My apologies! Um... Hello? And a fine day she be! Can I help you? Scallions. This be fine ground for 'em! This is our garden... Here you go. I thank ye. Won't you join us? Who's that? Mr. Foster be forgetting his horseshoe! He be the American foreigner... ...'twas livin' here afore. A man o' the west but still he put up charms. 'Charms'? He'd be sayin' in English all the time. 'Gho'-something. Hello? Yes? Hello, Nanny Kikuchi! What brung youse here? I'm Tochio, the District Chief. And I'm Fudeko Shinozaki. Come 'n be having tay! It's very good. 'Tay'? Oh, right away! Sit! I was just here o' the scallions. Was ye noo? I'm back. You're early today. It's not like head office in Tokyo out here. Hello, Tomoya. 'Koichi'. That's what I said. I'm home. Look! The District Chief was here asking us to help out. Wow! Look how spread out the houses are! The Council members are too old to get around to them all. There's temple events, shrine events, school events, the summer festival... And then they were talking to the old lady... 'The old lady'? Mrs. Kikuchi. She'd come here to plant scallions! I asked you to join us, Mother! I asked you, didn't I. You did? I asked you to have tea! So who's the scallion lady? The grandma at the Kikuchi house, where we went to say hello. The one I met is the eldest daughter, but she's back after a divorce... ...and she and her brother's wife don't get along, and on and on. The old lady speaks thick dialect, so she had to repeat everything... What? Beer. Tell Azumi the bath's ready. Sis! Bath! And they talked and talked and talked about Tokyo, and this, and that... Are you listening to me?! Yes! But you must have talked, too. The old lady must like you. The only people here to talk to are old ladies! I want to play soccer. Play, then. Not yet! But... Couldn't you have said 'no' when they sent you here? You think that too, Mom. You're just putting up with it, right? What brought this on? Koichi's not a boy who can tell people no. A yes-man? Hey! He always did what he was told. And we pay the price? Hey! I'm sure that's why Haruko was able to push me on you. Are you saying you'd rather be at Haruko's? I could be anywhere. I don't mind. I'm doing everything I can for her! Are you sure there wasn't a house in town? I told you! Not big enough for all of us. It's too big! Hey! I've only ever lived in Tokyo. All this worrying about how to deal with people... To tell you the truth, it's turning me into a wreck! Fumiko! I hate this place. Azumi! You know what they think I am at school? A 'LOL'! 'Lol'? I don't belong there! Wait! Dad, you're the only one who likes it here. I do. You shut up! You assume that what's good for you is good for all of us, too. The company shipped you out to Iwate, didn't they. Azumi! Azumi... Tomoya, stop fooling around. Help! Azumi! What's wrong? There's something here! What? A mouse? No! What's wrong? Nothing here. No, but there was! What is it? - I saw it! - Saw what? In the mirror! What? Someone's face...in the mirror! It was there! Could you look for a house in town? If it costs too much, I can work part-time. OK. Can I transfer money from here to a post-office account? Certainly. Fill out this form. Hurry with that. Excuse me. Excuse me! What? I want to play. OK, but you'll have to ask Kacchan. Who? Kacchan! Yeah? Keep going. He wants to play. You're the kid from Mr. Foster's place? Yes. We're practicing for the District Tournament. I played soccer. What position? Back...and forward... and in goal. Well, let's see what you can do. Right! Thank you! Here! You've never played, have you. On PlayStation. Can I try? Can you keep up in practice? I'll try my best. Is your house a bit weird? It's really weird. It's got a pit toilet, and you heat the bath with a fire. No spirits? What do you mean? You know what I mean. What kind of spirits? A house imp? What's a house imp? A house imp is a house imp. The old folks call them 'brownies'. 'Brownies'? My Grandma plants scallions there. She said Mr. Foster's house had a brownie. So... ...a gremlin, or a ghost? Not a ghost, and not a gremlin, either. Not quite a God, either. Mr. Foster put out horseshoes and things like that. To ward off evil? It's OK. No, it's not! Grandma says brownies won't hurt you. They're just there. What? I saw something in the bath when we moved in. Kind of hazy and swaying. Like this? I couldn't really see. They have hair like that. But... ...grown-ups only believe in what they see themselves. So if you see one, don't tell them. Azumi? Stay out. Your light was on... What? Right... How's school and everything? Awful. Right. Uh, but... Good night. Right...good night. 4-bedroom apartment ¥63,000 Your high-school entrance exam... ...depends on what you do this summer vacation. So study hard. OK, then. Bye-bye. Goodbye. Will you do something for us? Be in the swim meet. The end of next term. The middle school meet. You said you did swimming. The breaststroke. We're short of good swimmers. We'll get points even if you just enter. Please! You'll be our house imp! I know it! 'House imp'? They say it's a kind of guardian spirit. When you first came your hair looked like one. That's why we laughed. I'm not a LOL? A what? A 'laugh-out-loud'. What's that? Nothing. Anyway, will you? Sure. Great! Um... ...Hello? I'm Tomoya Takahashi. Hi. Want to try? You want some candy? Huh? Wait here. I'll go get some. Thank you. Where do the Haraguchis live? Over there. How do you get there? Over that bridge and around. Will those paths get me there? Sure it will. Thanks. Thank you. Are you all right? Yes! Grandma... ...what's up there? Can you see that little kid? I just saw him. That's Rokusuke. I'm sure of it. Rokusuke? This boy. Rokusuke. My little brother. He died when he was a child. It wasn't him, though. It's what they call a 'house imp'. A what? But don't tell anyone, OK? It's a secret. What was that? A house imp... Oh, no! Hello? Fumiko? Hi, Kyoko. How's the new place? You haven't called or anything! I mean to, but it's been crazy. It's out in the sticks, and I've been feeling awful. Me, too. Stiff shoulders, back pain, tingling hands and feet... And my doctor says its menopause! Menopause? And you? Gee, I don't know... You feel flushed. That's the warning signal. Do you start hearing things, too? What? And sensing strange things? Huh? No, no, nothing. You get more white hairs and wrinkles. And watch for constipation. Fumiko? Are you there? What's the matter, Fumiko? I'm all... This place... No, I'm fine. Look at that rain! Thank you for calling. Wasabi Tofu Pudding? Yes, sir. Thank you for your order. A rush order of Wasabi Tofu Pudding from the Marumatsuya. Do we have any in stock? Yes, of course we do. Mama What is it? Do something for me. Sure. What? Can you come home early? What's wrong? Hello? Could you have dinner before you come home? Are you feeling sick? No. Something's wrong. What's happened? I'm scared. I saw something. You did? Hello? What? Where are you? In Morioka. You are? And? Have you noticed anything about your mother? Something she said? No. About leaving, maybe going back to Tokyo? So that's how it is? How what is? Divorce. No! Don't be silly. I just got a strange phone call from her. She's leaving? No. Well, she has been a bit weird lately. Really? She's sticking close to me, like she doesn't want to be alone. She wants to take baths with me. She calls me into the kitchen, saying I need to learn to cook. So just maybe... ...she wants to make sure I remember her when she's gone. Please... What? Forget shopping, go home and be with your mother. There's no one else to ask. Please. Are you OK? You drive. Sure. Fumiko... Welcome. Take that table. Excuse me. For five? Here are your menus. Call me when you're ready. I'm sorry. What for? Not making dinner. Don't be silly! It's good to eat out sometimes. Right? Yeah, sometimes. Right? I wanted... Let's decide what to order. ...you all... Look, Mom! They've got carbonara! What's wrong with you two? Nothing. Um... Let's go see a farm on Sunday. Yeah! I'm out of town Saturday, but I can take the morning train back... ...and we can meet up here. This might not be the right time to say this... Then wait. Listen to me! I might be falling apart. I don't think I can stay in that house. We'll talk about it. I wanted to tell you first... Just wait, OK? Don't laugh. There's something really strange going on. I knew it! I'm afraid to look. Oh, please! I'm scared. Of mirrors. Mirrors? I'm seeing strange things. Like a child's face. A child? It's not funny! Right. At first I thought I was just seeing things... ...but no, it was really there. A little child in a kimono. I think I should see a doctor. That was a house imp. Maybe he can say... What? There's one in that house. Don't be silly! Grandma's right! I saw it two days ago. Tomoya, stop fibbing! I'm not. This house imp...do we have a pen and some paper? Is its hair like this? Yeah! I knew it! Will you all listen? I saw a child, too. Like this? Let me draw. Was it like this? And did the kimono go like this? This is all very interesting... ...but there is such a thing as mass hysteria. We've all had to move here suddenly from Tokyo... Do you know anyone else who's seen one? Not in my class. But everyone around here knows about them. Some people call them 'brownies'. They bring prosperity to a family that lives in the house... ...but when you move out, the family fortunes decline. Um... ...are you ready to order? Sorry We'll decide right away. Where should I put this? On the fridge? Too high? How about here? Mom...now Dad's acting funny. What are you doing? Getting a picture of it? Everyone's seen it but me. I want photographic evidence. You'll scare it and it won't appear. Just act normally. Kacchan says some people can see them and some can't. What? You have to be pure of heart, or you have to believe. So believe! Right. But I don't think I'm all that impure of heart. Of course not. Here you are. 'Er be me elder sister. Tay be verre. A seed 'er tworce. When A's a wee one. She be saying... ...when she be a girl... ...she seen one. When the Asanumas... ...be high wi' wee ones. I'll tell them, Mother. She says it was back when she was a little girl. When the Asanuma house, where you're living now... ...was full of children. The brownies bring you luck that you don't have yourself. Luck you don't have yourself? They're the lost children. The children who were weeded out. Around here they've always said... ...they became brownies. My aunt's dialect is hard to understand. Not at all. What does 'weeded out' mean? That's when parents take the lives... ...of newborn children. People weren't always rich like they are now. Especially out on the farms, sometimes the crops would fail. There wouldn't be enough food to feed the whole family... ...so young children had to be 'weeded out'. Yuck! My youngest brother was given away... ...to relatives. Rokusuke, who they said went to Tokyo? And died in the bombing. The brownies love candy and toys. The things they never had while they lived. They died as babies, after all... so they never really ate, and never really played. Anyway... Thank you. We'll have more to ask you. So will I. I'll have to show it how to eat and how to play. Did you hear that, Roku? You call him that? Why not? Yes... I heard that. For Roku I've got good news. We all know about you now, so you don't have to be afraid. We're all hoping you'll show up. So come and play any time you want. Cup-and-ball, or building blocks rock-paper-scissors... ...and soccer and catch and cards... They take practice, but I'll show you how. There's always food here or at the house... ...so you can just help yourself. Try one when you have a moment. Wasabi tofu pudding. It's good in hot weather. It's good in hot weather. All of you, help yourselves. Hello. You again? My apologies! This is good! What's that? Good morning. Have you done anything wrong? Head Office wants you. We want to relaunch your persimmon curry project. Look! Well be bringing you back here... ...but for now you can work from Morioka... ...with your old team. I finally convinced management it might work. We'll stick with the ingredients you were testing... ...but we're going to change the persimmons. You mean... What's-his-name's fruit cost too much. Mr. Kubota. We can import them cheaper. All right? We'll update you on the schedule. You can go. Thanks for coming. Thanks. What? Sir, if I could... Mr. Kubota has worked with us... ...to develop a persimmon that goes with curry. That's already been settled. Management's agreed to it. Then I cannot take part in this project. Are you sure? The president himself wants this to happen. Those of us with the vital task of making the food... ...that sustains life itself... ...need something more than a desire... ...for mere profit. What are you talking about? They need to have heart. Don't be stupid! It's true that food now tastes better, and has more nutrition. But I think it needs something else, too. Like what? Like... Like... ...love! You can't see it, but it's there. Our customers won't see it... ...but we need to have love, and consideration, and respect! And? And... And what?! And... ...love and consideration for those who worked to develop it. So if we're going to... ...cut Mr. Kubota loose... ...then I can't agree. Then you won't have a job here! Damn him! The other day the president saw some of the curry that was left... ...while they were testing another product. 'What's this?' he said. He tried it? He liked it, and asked why it had been canceled. Mr. Ishida canceled it himself. So that's why he's so upset... But this doesn't look good for Mr. Takahashi. I might end up losing my job over this. I won't go into the reasons why I fought back... ...but right now I feel as if... ...a load's been taken off my mind. Up until now I'm not really sure... ...if I've been fully alive as a man, as an employee... ...or as a father. I've always just held myself back... ...to avoid trouble. And now suddenly I ask myself if that's really living. And so... You fought back? But even if I lose my job... ...I'll still I look after you. Whatever happens, I'll still be there for you. Just like the fire burning... ...in this hearth... ...that warms us... ...heats our bathwater... ...and cooks our food. I promise you, I will be the fire in that hearth. I'll work these fields, do whatever it takes. I felt that... ...even before we came here. For a 53 year-old Section Chief... ...to get posted to a branch... ...means he's been shipped out like you said, Azumi. Sorry. I probably won't be going back to Head Office. I'll probably finish out my career in the branch office here. That makes me wonder... ...how long we'll all be living together here. Azumi, you'll probably get married and leave. Tomoya, one day you'll go off on your own. We won't be together here for very long. So until people start to leave... ...we can all live here in this great big house. When I retire... ...Mom and I can tend our garden here. And even though Grandma misses her own little town... ...she'll be with us, too. That's right. Even when you two leave... ...I want this to be... ...the house that's here to come back to. You do? Our last house... I rented it thinking that's what it would be. Tomoya! Hi, Kengo. Can I go with him? Sure. Come on! Bubbles! She looks nice. That suits you. Let's get an ice. Sure. Kacchan! Hi. Come on. Over there. Mother! We were looking for you. I have to go to the station. The station? Mother? Why, Mom? Rokusuke's coming back from Tokyo today. Rokusuke? I have to meet him at the station. Mom... He's just a little boy. He'll get lost if I'm not there. Grandma? Grandma! Snap out of it! Rokusuke died in an air raid years ago! Dad! What are you talking about?! Me? No one's coming back. Snap out of it, Mom. Please! Mother, what time... ...does his bullet train reach Morioka? 'Bullet train'? It's a steam train! He's coming on the overnight train. It gets in at 7 a.m. It does? Let's all go to the station and meet him, then. But it's just gotten dark now. Tomoya! OK, 'Dad'? I haven't seen him in years. He probably speaks Tokyo dialect now. I hope I can understand him! But before he went to Tokyo, we used to play together. We'd juggle beanbags, and blow bubbles... There's the station! 'Bubbles float into the air 'Up to the roof 'Up to the roof 'And disappear there' There! The train's arrived. Yes, it has. But Rokusuke's not there... Why not? Maybe he's not coming till tomorrow, Mother. Tomorrow? Maybe so. It must be. Let's come back tomorrow. Yes. 'Bubbles float into the air Up to the roof 'Up to the roof' Tomoya! Downfield! He's healthier now. Yes! He's having fun. We're still two goals down! Go have a drink. Kacchan... Get them back into position faster. Here's Tomoya. Have a drink! Having fun? That's great. Everyone's here! There they are. Hi! Azumi! How was the meet? We won! I came in second. How are you doing? Half-time, and we're down by two. Yeah? Go for it! It's half-time. I heard! Give it your best. 'Bubbles float into the air 'Up to the roof 'Up to the roof 'And disappear there' You still heat your bath like this? Doesn't everyone around here? We're not hicks. We all use gas. At least your parents get along. No, my mom and dad fight, too. I don't need soothing. It's lit! To Shinoda Middle School's victory! Thanks, Azumi. She's why we won. You went right past three girls! The girl beside her... I saw her! Her breathing was terrible! That's her! Azumi, you looked really good! Great! The house is so much more cheerful since we came here. It'd been a while since I'd heard the kids laughing. I wonder about Mother. Sometimes I don't know what she's talking about. Thank you. I hate to ask, but do the best you can for her, will you? It's all right. I'll be able to get close to her. I have some backbone, believe it or not. Like this... Very good! Good morning. You asked to see me... What are you up to? I said I won't deal with you, but you keep coming back. My apologies. So much it's annoying. The other day you brought those wasabi tofu puddings... As a gift. I hate wasabi. My apologies! No more gifts, all right? Right. 'Wasabi tofu pudding'... 'Microwave ready cheesecake'... Is this our product list? My staff says they're good. Get me those four by tomorrow. Can you? Yes! Of course! Thank you very much! Thank you! Roku! You're at it again. This I have to try! Yes. Join us. All right. Sit down. Sit down. Yes, sir. I'm told our pudding sales are way up... ...in Iwate Prefecture. Well... We'd like to bring you back to Head Office, Takahashi. This is Ishida's replacement. 'Abe'. We'd like you to work under Abe, not just on persimmon curry... ...but other products, too. Where's Mr. Ishida? He's posted to an affiliate. I'm told the other day in the preparation room... ...you made a little speech about love. I'd like you to proceed with that in mind. We have high hopes. To go back to Head Office, or stay here... One of the two. I want... ...to stay here. Me, too. I like it here. I might be able to play forward in the tournament next year. And this winter everyone's going to teach me to ski. We've all just settled in. But this won't be till next year, will it? Next month. But I could always go back to Tokyo myself. I'd prefer that. Yeah... I love a nice hearth... We should all go back together. The other day you said you'd be the fire in our hearth. Right in the middle, heating our food and keeping us warm. Where the whole family gathers round. And we can only gather round it because the hearth is here. If that hearth moves... ...I think we have to move with it. Doesn't our having lived here... ...mean that we'll be fine anywhere we go? Tokyo, huh? Yeah. I'd really love to stay here, though. You do? Because... It's love? No? Uh, yeah. That's right. I understand. I love it here, too. What? Nothing. I'll miss you. There you are! I've been waiting for you. Want to try? I'll show you. You put it in the liquid, then hold the blue button. You get tons of them. Here. Wow! Do it again. You know what, Roku? We're moving out of the house. You'll be all alone again. Do you have anywhere else to go? Somewhere you won't be lonely? Is it there? I think so. So I'll be the only one it never appeared to? I feel sorry for it. A little thing like that, being a God of Good Fortune. But because of it, we've changed somehow. You did that. You chose this house. Thank you. For coming with me. A gray hair... Quiet! Don't forget your bubble stuff. With all that, Roku shouldn't be lonely. Shall we go? Roku! Roku! Goodbye! We weren't here very long, but thank you for everything. Thank you. Take care. Come back and see us. What a lovely day! Goodbye. Come back and visit. Goodbye. Azumi... Azumi! This is from all of us. Don't forget us! Mail us, OK? Come back any time! Good luck in Tokyo! Thank you, Mr. Ando. Thank you. Stay well, Takahashi. I'll see you. Come back any time! Come back any time! Anytime you like! Bye-bye! Huh? Look at this! Isn't that Roku's? I left it in the kitchen. Now what do we do? What's it doing here? Hello. Table for six? No... Dad! Dad... Yes. For six. This way. Welcome. Here's the menu. I'll come back in a minute.
