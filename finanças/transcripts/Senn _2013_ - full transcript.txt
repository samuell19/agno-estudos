Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha [dark rhythmic music] [unintelligible alien dialogue] The final item in our agenda today is the planetary asset known as Pyom. This remote backwater was acquired over 800 years ago by our Royddin subsidiary an undeveloped resource-rich "gem" of a property with the convenience of a preexisting atmosphere. After mineral extractions were completed, Pyom was still quite valuable as a manufacturing base, boasting a profitability index of 127. Sadly, operations in Pyom fell victim to the economic collapse in that system 73 years ago and a freeze on maintenance expenditure remains in effect. Compounding the planet's woes, decades of grade 3 smelting without any environmental remediation have taken a toll, and no funds have been allocated for cleanup. Models are being run for various divestiture strategies including both cold pullout and sale, in which case the indigenous labor force will presumably be included. And now, if there are no questions, this meeting is adjourned. You were not chosen. It was purely coincidental that the sum total of you was the key. It has begun. [dark rhythmic music] Are you OK? I'm fine. - How long have you been here? - Just a few minutes. I'm glad I got to see you this morning. They posted my new schedule for the week- Mostly nights. But it means I get to see more of you. - Hope I'm worth it. - When you're not I'll let you know. [loud buzzer] Lineup. I have to go get dressed. Kana, I hate it when you leave. See you in a few days. [atmospheric music] [music continues] [music builds] Senn! My favorite wedge maker! - How was your weekend? - Ahh, same as always. Working my fingers out to almost nothing. Pretty soon you'll have to call me "Nubby". - Seriously, though, what happened to your hands? - Aww, nothing. Just some new chemical in the finish coating line. Burns like a nudge rod, but on a brighter side, it gives me a massive buzz, and makes me really horny, so I can't complain. - That's why I love you, Resh. Always the optimist. - It's OK! I've been showering my considerable charms all over the Crew Chief. You know she's bound to transfer to the fluff-line any day now. I think she likes me. If only she knew... -She doesn't stand a chance. Solidarity! Alright. Oh, before I forget... I've got a certain rare item for a certain special someone. -You found a copy? How'd you get your hands on one?! -I've got my ways. - And you sir, are forever in my debt. - No. Forever is not long enough. I'll pay you back. I promise. - That smile on your ugly face is payment enough. Come on! those widges won't make themselves. [atmospheric music] [loud buzzer] [changing assembly line noises] [choral music begins] -Senn, get over here! There's another on for you. This was not your fault. You didn't deserve this. None of us deserves this. But... at least you don't have to be here anymore. [crashing noise] [assembly line noise] What's going on with you, Senn? You don't seem like yourself lately. Nothing special. I've been having these weird dreams. Could be from stress... when's your next day off? Our group doesn't get any until the next prod cycle. Bastards. I knew I'd find you two love units up here. Hi, Resh. Kana, darling, mind if I join? I brought newfangled snacks. Oh, my favorite kind! Thanks. Which planet did these come from? Don't know, but I can't stop eating them. What's the prize this time? Or, is it a comic? No, it says "Personality test: Put your thumb here." You have an aptitude for... "animals." Hey, how did it know I like animals? Is this one of those "join a cult" things? No. I think it's a sneaky way for them to track what you like so they can get you to buy more stuff. Sure is wasted on us. What you love most... "your family." Sorry. If only this stupid thing could tell me where my family is... I know exactly where mine is. I hear from them all the time. Especially when I'm late getting them money! But it's the only thing that keeps them alive, so, you know, what the hey! Sorry folks. I don't have much to contribute. Family has never been one of my big concerns. [choral music] At least you don't have anyone to miss. Huh-I heard there's an ExWorld passenger transport leaving next week. ExWorld? It would take two lifetimes of our wages just to afford a ticket. Those shuttles are so old they, they blow up half the time anyway. And if you can actually get a ride to another rock in our system. They just deport you. Well, I can still dream. I'm gonna find my sisters someday. We're not going anywhere. All we're good for is making weird junk we don't understand and never afford. That's what fills all the shuttles that leave here... off to rich people in other systems. They probably have no idea where Pyon even is. Yeah! Yeah. Those suckers probably think everything they buy is made by robots. Right! For the price of one synbot you could buy this entire busted planet! Hmm..We must be good for something else. Ever known anyone to jump the line and prove it? Look, you two might not be good for much, but I tell you what I'm good for. OK? Loving, fighting, scheming and surviving-in that order. Gotta go, got lots to do... We should head back soon too. When can I see you again? I don't know. They keep changing my shifts. Damn. Guess I'll just have to miss you, then. I don't know what I'd do if you didn't. [melancholy piano music] I hate feeling so broken. Senn, you should be proud. All the other kids that get sold are hopeless. Enjoying all the big words? I've been so buried I haven't gotten a chance to start reading it yet. You know, most people ask me to smuggle in perk patches, drama vids, smutlets... You're the only one who wants books. What can I say? I enjoy using my brain. It's either that or dying of boredom. Hey, listen, I have something to ask you. What? You remember that group that group-mate of mine who was transferred to the Biohaz about a month ago? Uhh... the one you liked? What was his name? Lann. Yesterday he was mouthing off about that video they made us watch for entertainment. I think it was called... [cheesy sound effects] It's good that we have good the communication systems we need or else we'd be blown up just like the other planets. Aha! This is the last planet we have to blow up! Now-destroy them! [cheesy laser blast] We will destroy the base by laser cannon. Good. [cheesy sound effects] Red alert! White people in the area! Now, let's go inside and free the slaves! Looks like it was made by a 12-year-old! It was. the head foreman's kid made it. No wonder! They forced us to watch that a few days ago. So ridiculous. Huge spaceships don't land on planets. Everybody knows that. So, what about Lann... don't tell me... He's delisted. Aw, that's awful. You must be crushed. Look, you know the crew chief in Bio, right? Do you think you could talk to her for me? I mean, maybe she'll take him back. I know there's not much of a chance, but... [strange metal sounds] Cuff me! What was that? You mean you could see it, too? I thought it was just me. If that's the grid shorting out again, let's get out of here. I do not want to get deep fried like those guys in Bunk 12. No, it's not that. I wanna show you something. Cuff my balls! What is that? I don't know. It comes and goes. Whatever you do, don't touch it! Oh, I'm definitely going to touch it. You really, really shouldn't touch it. I have to touch it. Resh, do not touch it. I need to touch it. [piercing scraping sounds] Ahh! That's OK. No damage. What is it? I wish I knew. Wait a sec. No, I've seen something like that before. It was in a spy vid. Some sort of surveillance device. You're being spied on. Come on, Resh, those trashy vids you watch aren't real! It looked exactly like that! I swear! If it is what you say it is, it certainly isn't well hidden. No, this is big. There's got to be some reason that it's there. [wind noise] [atmospheric music] How's the book you got from Resh? Oh, it's super interesting. There's a character in it with a job that would be perfect for you. What job? It's a medic for animals, just animals. Really?! There are people who just treat animals? Apparently so. I'd love to do something like that. It'd be pretty nice, huh? Who am I kidding? The only experience I have with animals is watching them in vids. I've never even seen a real animal in person. I'd be hopeless. No, you'd be terrific. You're the most caring person I know. Stop it! You're just trying to make me feel better. Ow. What is it? Umm... Umm... Just a sharp pain behind my eyes. Happens now and then. Do you think it's related to the... what did you call them again? Uhh... I don't know. Vivid dreams? I wish I could see them. You might not want to. I don't know if I should be afraid of them or not. I've been seeing other things, too... while I'm awake. It's starting to worry me. Well, you've definitely been dazing out more and more lately. Pretty soon you're not going to be able to work, and then... I can still manage, OK? You're fooling yourself. They've already had to stop the line twice because of you, and if it happens again they'll throw you out. You have to dig through the trash dunes with the other discards. What can I do? I can't control the visions. I can't stop them from happening. Maybe you should see the group medic? Medic? I might as well go to the Foreman and resign right now. You know what'll happen? At the third word out of my mouth about the "visions", that'll be the end of it. They'll brand me unfit. It will be over. And not just for me, but for both of us. Senn, we have to do something. I'm worried about you, you're sick and you don't seem to be getting better. Kana, I'm not sick. Alright, I, I know the things I'm seeing are weird and hard to explain. But, you know, they're important somehow. It's not a sickness. I just wish I knew what it was all about. All I want is for you to be OK. I care about you. I love you. I wish I were good at telling you how much you mean to me. You know, you're about the only thing in this cuffed up place that isn't rotting from the inside out. I just wish I didn't feel so helpless. We'll figure something out. [music] What are you? What do you want from me? Why are you even here? What are you waiting for? Whatever you're here to do, just do it. Alright? Just get it over with already. Just quit hiding and fucking show yourself! [music continues] Senn! Senn, snap out of it! You won't believe this. It was amazing. I busted through a new part and all of space opened up in front of me. It all makes sense now. Forget about that. It's opening up right here, come on! What?! [loud booming music] Wait! Senn, you're going in to that thing?! I have to, Kana. Everything that's happened up to this point, every cell in my body is saying that this is the right thing to do. I want you to come with me. Go? But we don't know what's in there or what the hell it even is. Look at it, it goes on forever in both directions. It seems crazy, but but I'm asking you to trust my gut on this one, Alright, remember, remember when you said "We'll figure something out.' Things have been figured out! But this is insane, Senn. How can this be happening? I don't know exactly, but it has. It's not something I'm dreaming. It's here. And it's not a broken down ExWorld shuttle. You knew this was going to happen?! You saw it? No, no, I didn't know... But I do now. The goons are coming, you better go. [alarm sounding] Resh is right; if we stay here, we're dead. I can't believe I'm doing this. Resh, Resh, I want you to join us. Right, I know... Senn, my mom... I'm torn up leaving you here, man. You know me. I'm a fighter. I'm going to get by. Get that brain of yours out of here before they wash it for you. Go, go! [music continues] [music continues] What is all this? I don't know. Welc'... - Who are you? - Wel-come Welcome. Make yourselves comfortable. Ummm, thanks. We'll try. We hope our arrival was not too disruptive. Only a bit. This is a space-ship, right? That is correct. While you are here, please make yourselves at home. Sure. Maybe you should explain what's going on. We've been tracking an unknown entity which has reached deeper and deeper strata within the Polychronom. Levels never reached before. Polychronom? It's the giant construct I've been seeing in my dreams. I'm assuming I'm the entity. Yes, exactly. So, what is the Polychronom? We have been studying the "construct", as you call it, for some time. But, we still do not know its purpose, or who created it. Wait. You mean you didn't build it? Oh, no. Our technology is primitive compared to the sophistication present within the Polychronom. Incredible! When I'm there in my mind. It feels like I'm trying to solve something. But at the same time, I'm not. It's more like an emotional test. But... It's hard to explain. What's going on in there? We hope you can answer that for us. Entire civilizations have devoted themselves to deciphering the Polychronom. But, none have accomplished as much as you have. Not to mention, in so little time. We did not even know in which part of the galaxy to look for you until recently. Why Senn? What's so special about him? That is a mystery as well. Surprisingly, he is able to connect to the construct from afar. So why did you come all the way here? We see ourselves as stewards of the Polychronom. In that role we desire to aid whomever the construct chooses to grant access. I just want to be there. See it in person, more than anything. It is a real, physical thing, right? Yes, it is quite as you say, "real". Do you require rest? Please, take some time to get acclimated, and then we can discuss further. Our voyage will take many of your days, so there is time. Before you go, what should we call you? What's your name? We... have no name. Did he say his name was "We"? And I was wondering... What about a place to sleep? Food? You know, things like that... Of course. Our apologies. Will this do? That'll do. Nicely. [atmospheric music] [loud crashing sound] Hi, umm... This thing you're doing right now- please don't do it again. To what are you referring? Standing here, watching me while I sleep. It's disturbing. So sorry. Uh, since you're here, can I ask... how far is it we'll be traveling? The Polychronom is in a system approximately 1,041 of your light years from our present location. One-thousand light years? Wow! The distance is of no consequence to us. Can you imagine the amazing stuff you could discover with a spaceship like this? Strange phenomena, undiscovered races! That is a difficult question to answer. Oh, it wasn't really a question. I was just thinking of the possibili- The cosmos is so vast that the likelihood of coming across something of interest is very remote. And time is even more vast. Almost all of the advanced races we found evidence of perished long ago. Oh, well. That's too bad. I can still dream, though. Hey, Senn, ask for some new clothes for us. Oh, oh, and some books. Of course. Still can't believe this is happening. Me neither, it's so strange. Well, imagine if we were transporting insects somewhere. Right? We wouldn't have the first clue to know what would make it happy. True. I hope Resh is holding up alright. He made the right decision to stay behind. He's a tough one. He'll be OK. You're right. At least I hope you're right. What are you doing? Cooking. I see... umm... I don't mean to interrupt but I have a question. So there is a higher level part of the construct that I can't seem to get past and I don't know why. Describe it, please. The shapes there are tightly packed together, into a sort of wall, and I can't seem to get around it. Ah, yes. You are confused because you are not used to dealing with multi-dimensional space. Multi-what? Some of the "shapes", as you call them, in that strata exist in dimensions higher than our own. What you are seeing is not the object itself, but a shadow of the object. Huh? To explain... Take a two-dimensional object. For example, a square. If we introduce a light source onto the flat plane the square lives in, the resulting shadow is a one-dimensional line. In the same way, a three-dimensional object, like a cube, casts a two-dimensional shadow. Finally, a fourth dimensional object casts... Casts a three-dimensional shadow! Exactly. The objects that are confusing you are cast shadows of fourth dimensional volumes. So how do I tell which shapes I see are regular, and which ones are shadows? It is simple. Shadows cannot cast shadows themselves. I see, so all I need to do is look for shapes that should be casting shadows but don't. Yes. The difference can be subtle. But it should be noticeable. Be cautious though-shadow shapes are inherently unstable. Thank you. It's so beautiful here. I don't care if it's not real. I bet you're thrilled with the animals. Yeah, but honestly the big ones kind of scare me. Uh. Home feels so far away. I can't even imagine going back there. We would have been blacklisted by now, anyway. There'd be nothing to go back to, except digging through the trash dunes for food scraps. The factories should be smashed. What they do, or more so, how they do it is immoral. Yeah, but to be replaced by what? Some other entity that exploits people like us in the same way? There must be something we can do. I don't know. Give it some time. Did you ever think you'd be traveling in a massive spaceship to a strange construct a thousand light-years away? Clearly, anything's possible. You always know how to make me feel better. [emotional electronic music] [music continues] Would you like some? Yeah. Sure. Cow juice? Um... OK. Alright. I was wondering, and I hope it isn't rude, but I assume this isn't your natural form. What do you really look like? It is complicated. There is a physical component to our being but it is only visible in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum your eyes cannot see. If artificially shifted down, it would appear to you as noise, or static. It was worth a try. How did you first come across the Polychronom? Long ago, we discovered an object in the center of the iron core of our home land. It was communicating with thousands of objects like it. We followed this complex signal web until we reached the Polychronom. Once there, we discovered evidence of others who had attempted to unlock its secrets. But by the time we arrived, they had long perished. And no one knows what it's for? There are many hypotheses, but no certainty. We assume it is essentially in a dormant state. Waiting. For reasons unknown. Why are you so fascinated with it? In our travels, we've never come across anything as advanced or as intriguing as the Polychronom. We feel that studying it is worth the dedication of unlimited time and resources Sounds like you almost worship it and you don't even know what it is. Haven't you ever thought about the fact that you might end up like all the others and their dead ships floating around it? This concept is not one we have contemplated. Aren't you scared that it might be some sort of powerful weapon? Seems risky to tinker with things you don't understand. It's not a weapon. Don't ask me how I know, but I just do. I don't know, something that powerful could easily convince us into thinking... anything. We feel that possible scientific advancements outweigh any risks. Just be careful, Senn. [bright, atmospheric music] [bright, atmospheric music] Hey, Kanna! Wow! Senn, do you think it's OK for us to go in there? I think all this stuff's here for us. What do you think this place is? I think it's someone's house. Or, more accurately, a copy of someone's house. What? What's wrong? These are Manufactory documents. Internal memos... Let me see. What's that one about? It's umm... It's about, acquisition of, labor resources. Oh, that. It says the practice has been banned in two systems because of what happened-the abuses. I can't even imagine how horrific it must have been. They wanted workers who were fastest and most compliant. You know, one that were a good return on their investments So they'd drill us all day long on how quickly we could assemble a widge. How well we followed orders. Ones who weren't so good at it got the yoke, or were beaten. Ones who couldn't never meet the standard always mysteriously came down with Dramatic Fever, and they were gone. The worst thing they ever did was pit us against each other. The one tiny ray of light were the friendships I made with the other kids, but they had to go poison this too. If there's one thing I learned there it's that hating is easy- it's kindness that takes guts. When did you get out? At 12 we graduated into the work-force. Shifts on the line were a vacation in comparison. I wish there was something I could do. It was so long ago. You don't need to do anything. Let's just enjoy being here, now. [foreboding music] Senn! Senn-are you OK? I thought I lost you there for a minute. I don't know. I don't know anymore. You're back. For now. Come on, we're going to be late for dinner. Wait, dinner? Yeah, We's making some sort of special meal. Here. Oh, great! I've seen his cooking. I'm keeping an open mind. Fish or bird? Fish. Fish or bird? Umm... bird. Please, enjoy. We hope the food does not disappoint. Uh, thank you for... cooking. Yeah, thank you. It is our pleasure. Oh, um... I was wondering.... about the others before me who had the dreams... were they OK mentally afterwards? Did they experience any... problems? We have never encountered any being who has accessed the Polychronom before you. I thought you'd met others, who didn't get as far as Senn. We have been able to recover and analyze several data archives from the dead ships that surround the construct. They tell of those who had your ability. But the data was difficult to decipher, and incomplete. Oh, um, well, did the records mention any issues they had? I'm afraid so. It appears that some of those who were able to access the Polychronum experienced mental disintegration. What? But you said some. Not all. No. Not all. The rest died. They died?! Why didn't you tell me that before? Can't you do anything to help him? There was not much we can do. As we do not fully understand the processes of work. If you would allow us to temporarily remove your brain we could develop a more detailed analysis. No, please do not do that! Are you serious? It is a simple procedure. How could you even suggest something like that? Who do you think you are? We have, arrived. [atmospheric music] Wow. For a day or so I felt the presence more strongly, the connection more tangible. At first I thought I was just going crazy, but now... now it all makes sense. I wish I could have seen this from the beginning. I might have understood. Oh, there was no way for you to have known. So what do we do now? Get into some sort of shuttle and fly into it? No. The physical structure of the Polychronum fluctuates to violently for travel within. It is much better to access it from a safe distance. I agree. I think I have a lot of work to do. Any suggestions on how I should continue? We wish we could be of more assistance. But we have no knowledge of the advanced strata you have reached. That's OK. I'll figure it out myself. [music continues] Resh! Country A invades Country B vowing to wipe out all its inhabitants. Which country is good and which is evil? What? Country B 50 years earlier colonized its current lands decimating the native population in the process, Now, which is good and which is evil? Both, I guess. Millions are dying on a planet because of drought- do you help them? Yes, of course. What if the draught is caused by overpopulation? Oh, uh... Should holy books be an acceptable source for determining a society's moral code? What about ones that contains rules for keeping slaves? I don't know. -Could the conditions ever exist where the extiction of a civilization is preferable to its survival? If an artificial intelligence is indistinguishable from a person, it it murder to erase it or shut it down? An artificial what? You did whatever the guards wanted even though you knew it would make life harder for the other kids. You were the guards' pet. And then you pretended to be friends with everyone as you knifed them in the back. What did you say? To get special treatment you would even take the jobs that no one else wanted. like helping to get rid of all those bodies. It wasn't like that. Do you know why you agreed to do every filthy thing that they wanted? Because you felt nothing. You looked at those bodies and you felt a big fat emotional zero. You're dead inside. You're a fraud. You're a failure. You left your best friend behind on a hideous planet. Left him to rot. Resh, Resh, Resh, if you're in there somewhere, I'm sorry. I'm not proud of what I did. OK? If I could go back and change things I would! Resh, I would do anything for you. If saving your life meant losing mine I wouldn't hesitate. [foreboding music] My arms felt bare without them. I don't know what I'm... [emotional electronic music] Making progress? I'm so close tho getting it. I'm right there and then the construct shifts and then I'm blocked again. You know what? let's go for a walk- maybe it will help clear my head. Wait. Look over there. Oh, oh- I see them. What are they? I don't know. Ah, they're beautiful. -The papers we were looking through... -Yeah? ...the worker roles? I found one of my sisters in them. Really? That's great! Where did it say she was?! It didn't say. She was moved to another system a year ago. I don't know which one. Well, you know, that's a start, I guess. Yeah.I'm just glad to know she's still alive. Me too. I'll keep looking. [foreboding music] What is it? My hand - It's not there. I don't exist. What are you talking about? I don't cast a shadow. Look - there's your shadow, but under my hand, nothing! What do you mean? It's like the shapes in the construct- I'm just a projection of a higher-dimensional object. I'm not me! How's that possible? I don't know. I still feel like myself but I'm clearly not really here. Senn, you feel fine, you're just imagining things. No, no, you don't understand, alright? What you're touching isn't real. Someone has some explaining to do. Senn! Where are you going? You knew about this? Sorry, please explain. You knew that I was switched out, or changed, or whatever happened to me... You knew that I was just a three-dimensional shadow all along?! Yes, we knew. How could you not have told me? You did not ask. What else are you keeping a secret? What else were you not going to tell me? How can I trust you about anything?! This is all about you, isn't it? You're just using us, we're like puppets to you. You don't even care that my real body's probably dead. The conversion happened before we came for you. In fact, it was the conversion itself that alerted us to your presence. Without it, we would never have found you. Can't you do something, anything? There is no way to influence or reverse whatever process changed you. Alright, well, whatever I am now, it's unstable, right? I'll eventually just disintegrate like those shapes? Yes. The probability of that outcome is high. Then I'm going in there. Into the Polychronum? Yes. I am physically going in there, alright? Maybe there's a chance that I can get my real body back. It is too dangerous to enter... You're going to send me in now! We refuse. Well, well...If you are not going to send me in, then I'll... I'll...I'll communicate to the Polychronum that you're trying to destroy it. No, we beg you do not do that. We will ready a transport device. And don't try to trick me! I'll know. Kanna, I'm dead. I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm just a shell. No, Senn, you're just confused. I've let you down. I promised I'd be there for you, but now... now all you have to hold on to is a ghost. I don't wanna lose you! You already have! Senn, we didn't come all this way for things to end like this. I'm not giving up yet. Things that I never thought I could ever do, like find my sisters. There's a chance I can do that now. I wish I could know what you're feeling right now, but I can't. Is it wrong of me to feel like having you here as you are is better than losing you entirely? No, no, it's not wrong. But this is something I have to do. I can't stay like this. No-I could start desintegrating any moment. It feels like I'm dead. So what are we supposed to do? Start mourning your death? I don't know. How do you mourn your own death? We must insist you reconsider- we cannot allow you to endanger yourself. It would be the ultimate betrayal of our role as stewards to the Polychronum. I already told you. I'm going. How can we convince you otherwise? You can't. We understand. Please, remain where you are. The craft will be leaving shortly. [loud bang] Senn, go quickly! I love you, Kana. Just promise me you'll make it back. [Rhythmic electronic music] [loud crashing noise] [metalic noise] [metalic noise] [atmospheric music] It has been a long time, but finally, you have come. There's much you would like explained. You're me when I was young, aren't you? Yes. Why are you here? This is when it first began. When what began? The connection. It first started when you were at this age. Why me? Why was I chosen? You were not chosen. Your homw world was implanted with the Beacon like all the others. It was purely coincidental that the sum total of you was the correct key to activate the beacon. Wait, the sum total of me? Your physical form, your thoughts and actions, your experiences. The details are not important. So the Beacons are a part of the Polychronom. Yes. What is the Polychronom's purpose? What does it do? You know the answer to that, already. [stirring electronic music] Welcome back. Kana. Do you remember everything that happened? It's a bit foggy, but, yeah. How, I don't know. Thinking about higher dimensional space gives me a headache. Glad to be me again. I never did find out exactly why they switched me out. Something about needing to protect me... So? What was it like? What did you see? So hard to explain! Well, tell me what it's for-what does it do? Kana, do you feel any different compared to before I left? What do you mean? How do I feel right now? Your side hurts. And your head feels like it was hit by a metal folding machine. But you're happy to be back, and to see me. It's what it does. What? It connects us. It makes us aware of how everyone around us feels, how everyone connected to us feels. And with that comes self-awareness, and differentiation. That's incredible! It's gonna change everything back home. The effect reaches that far? It reaches everywhere! Well, within this part of the galaxy, we believe. Thank you for everything you've done. Please, accept our apologies. We should not have tried to stop you. You were just doing what you thought was right. Now that the Polychronom has been awakened, we have much research to do. Do you know of any way we may connect to it directly, as you have? Please. It is very important to us. When I was in there I discovered why you were not able to access it. Because of the function that it was designed for, it only recognises biological life forms. But that means... Yeah.Since your physical composition isn't biological, The Polychronom doesn't even know you exist. [scary rumbling sound] So many thousands of lifetimes, wasted. The object we have devoted our entire existance to has no idea who we are, or what we have sacrificed? I'm sorry. This cannot be understood! [fires burning, rumbling] I, I want to help but I don't know what, I don't know what to do. If, uh, wait, if he can create animals, why doesn't he create some sort of biological component to his behavior? [bright rhythmic music] Of course! Um... Here, this might help. [music continues] Do you think We going as an animal is going to work? I have no idea. But come on, let's go get Resh and find your sisters. [unintelligeble alien dialogue] I appreciate everyone assembling for this meeting in such short notice. As you can imagine, the recent psychological phenomenom, which I can confirm all our subsidiaries are experiencing, necessitaded this unusual step. It appears the automated forecasting systems we always relied on are no longer useful to us. We are in uncharted territory. In view of this development, we all agree we need to decide quickly about managing our populated planetary holdings and living conditions for their inhabitants. Contact has even been established with regional persons' rights organizations to explore more sustainable options. For the time being, all neew acquisitions will be limited to uninhabited worlds. I share the apprehension I feel from you all about the economics of this new reality but also in your collected relief that policy changes are being investigated. Thank you for your thoughtful participation in this process. The floor is now open for discussion.
