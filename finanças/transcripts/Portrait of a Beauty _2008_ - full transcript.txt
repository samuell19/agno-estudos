There was no corruption of morality or betrayal in my father's days What bothers Your Majesty? You seem to be the only virtuous man in the court It's in the strength of your brush From those protesting for abolition of class system To those conspiring to bring down the King This country's in chaos When the King practices frugality by wearing hemp clothing How is it that his subjects are so corrupt and demoralized? It's because the time is peaceful under Your Majesty's ruling Maybe my wisdom is short That's not true, Your Majesty This is the weaver's workshop and the brass smith forge This is my version of your "Cultivation" It's natural for a pupil to follow the style of his teacher but a flower... cannot come in full bloom without revealing its inside I'll remember that, sir Find your own style and techniques "Heavenly tiger" No one can match you for details It's a masterpiece I heard your grandson saw your "Tiger" and bursted out crying in fear Now that there are two tigers I fear they might fight each other Nowadays watching my grandson is more pleasing than painting What pleases you, these days?

Hyewon SHIN Yun-bok, Your Majesty Disciplinary action was being taken Why did you make such paintings? Speak up Speak up, I said! Hyewon has disgraced the court and brought shame to Dohwaseo with vulgarity I beg your Majesty to punish him severely... The paintings are not vulgar, Your Majesty What? Interpretation is in the eyes of the beholder The paintings are satirical of corrupt noblemen and courtesans In the eyes of lewd-minded the pictures may seem indecent... That's not true, Your Majesty! Obscenity is obvious to any eyes Please see here! A widow watching mating of dogs and her servant pinching her thy How can such behavior be described anything other than obscene? And the flowing creeks and rocks in the background... are clearly a lewd depiction of female genit... of... a graphic depiction of... female anatomy Whether meant as satire orjoke, Too much is never better than lacking Exercise self-disciple and cleanse your mind Your father sent me a letter It's full of worries for his son's progress My paintings weren't meant to be satirical I never meant to harm or make fun of anyone If they weren't satirical then they were lewd paintings Why do you condemn my paintings? Condemn? What I painted were natural humans The natural weakness of minds easily seduced and swayed by love I thought you would understand, of all people! What rubbish!?

The exams are not far away Refrain yourself from outings Focus wholly on practice I want to see how beautiful you are Look You're the fairest of all of Joseon I hope to make a good sale on this trip so I can buy you new equipments Why are we going to the temple?

The dress that I gave you I haven't seen you wear it Something must have bothered you You came to see me so early What did you do with the dress? I get more than ten rolls of silk as gift every month How can I remember a piece of cloth that I received 3 years ago? My servant sold it at the market Perhaps she gave it to her niece You're wrong to think you know men's mind How dare I do that? But I know a little about a man's body Likewise, I cannot know your thoughts but I know your body inside out I'll give you my all I'll stay with you and do everything you ask of me Please save Kang-mu I have been greatly shocked and saddened by the recent atrocities committed by these criminals the extent to which people abandon values that constitute this country has become truly unacceptable... You take after your father It puzzles me... My arrows hit the target every time Why do my orders fail to do that? Mastering archery takes one man but politics take many men Why you asking me a tough favor? Because I believe in the great goodness of Your Majesty No... No! No! No... No... No! Stop the execution! It's the order of the King! His Majesty the King has reduced the penalty Halt the execution! The sinner is to be banished to Isle of Geoje Sir, please tell her not to worry... tell her that I'm okay Be grateful that you're saved and don't ever come back Step aside! We have a long way to go I must be getting old I seem to see spirits these days I saw your brother in my dream He was shedding blood tears I kept wiping them but they wouldn't stop How will I see his face after I die? Listen carefully. The only way to rectify the wrongs you did him is to suck out KIM Hong-do dry and become the greatest court painter Prepare yourself for the court I know you aren't being true to your heart I only hope there is be no more sadness because of me I was the happiest when there was nothing but painting between us Such moment never existed You know that from the beginning my intentions weren't innocent I had no choice but to love even that Commutation, it sure is! Half of them die on the way Shall we head back now? It looks like he's almost done up We'll get in trouble if we're caught Stop! I prayed... I would see you one more time before I die All because of me... Not your fault. Never! Is certainly a woman So busy keeping the King company maybe you'll be made his concubine Kang-mu is back He's with your beloved pupil I think they're running away tonight That cannot be! You really don't know women, do you? Or is it love that you don't know? It's late Why are you still up? I was waiting for you Something bothering you? No. I thought that I never gave you anything I want to present you a painting Don't go... Please! Let's bring him into the house He can live with us and help you paint Are you certain about your accusations? Tonight it is It's your only chance to get rid of them The poison will start spreading soon I have the antidote but if you make another step, I can't give it to you Give her up! You can't do anything for her I can't let her throw her life away and live as an exile for the rest of her life Is that it? Is that the reason? We don't want much We just want to be with each other for the rest of our lives How long do you think that feeling will last? You either live the moment and die or live with the memories You can't have it both ways Erase her from your memories Don't ever see her again Her face, the eyes, the smile Wipe it clean off your heart I beg of you. Please... I've never loved her half-heartedly Never once been untruthful with my heart You don't know what it has been for me! No... No! Hyewon joined Dohwaseo under false pretence of a man and by doing so, brought the court into contempt I beg Your Majesty to record her wrongdoings in the book so the shame will pass down to generations yonder I beg you also to punish her father and KIM Hong-do for conspiring the evil deed Why did you deceive my trust? You spoke of virtues in front of me but you disdained the court with lewd pictures I have no shame for my paintings They are what my hand painted I met one man on my journey to explore humanity I touched his body and felt his heart The frailty of human was so beautiful so beautiful, I had to paint them Your Majesty! That poor child painted thousands of pictures for her dead brother All she wanted was to paint I used her passion to fulfill my greed I am solely to blame for the crime she committed Please, kill me Be quiet! Remove that prisoner's tongue! Hyewon and KIM Hong-do shall be beheaded! Your Majesty! KIM Hong-do has served the court with undeterred loyalty It would be unjust to punish him without determining the extent of his involvement in the affair Please have mercy! Take them away Interrogate them until cries of remorse are heard from their proud mouths Why didn't you say anything? Set him free His Majesty wishes to set him free You refuse to speak? Then, let the picture speak your mind Teacher has always disapproved of my paintings He only found out last night that I was a woman Last night, I had a row with the mirror-maker and have accidently killed him Teacher found out and captured me before the troops arrived If that is the truth, you shall not avoid death penalty It's the truth, Your Majesty! I destroyed her innocence Unprejudiced insight that saw beauty in what others condemned as filth I destroyed it with my lust One can only live so long I'm not afraid of death My only remorse is that I couldn't defend her innocence Hyewon SHIN Yun-bok who brought shame to Dowhaseo shall be banished KIM Hong-do shall be pardoned Why... Why did you go through with that to save me? Under a thin coat the love filling her tender bosom, I convey through the tip of the brush
