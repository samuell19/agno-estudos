Társulás Stúdió presents A film by Gábor Bódy DOG'S NIGHT SONG "On the Road." Particular attention and care is required when travelling today. - Hey, you never marry? So as to feed another one? What does she have a mother for? You playing tennis? You're no Taróczy! - Of course not. Jancsi! János! Can you hear me? I can't turn off the tap. Little one, which way to the church? That way. ... gone the days so glorious You'll ensnare the women no more Nor steal a kiss, nor break a heart My Adonis, those days are o'er Nor steal a kiss, nor break a heart My Adonis, those days are o'er You really want to go to church? - Sure. I'll do your hair. ... Believe me! You're not so special, believe me! It's a long-distance connection It's long distance love It is indeed! Hello. Is this place free? - Yes! Where are you heading? - To the sanatorium. My poor father is ill... Do you know where the bus-stop is? - 'Course. Can I come along? If you have the time, yes. - Good. Thanks. "On the Road." And again, some recently reported accident: Between Szeged and... Why do old people disappear? Don't tell! But why shouldn't I? - What? I went into the room, he was sitting there, watching TV. Dead! Oh, my word! Oh my God! Hey! Hey! Come here quick! Looks pretty bad! - Where's a telephone? At the observatory. Or in the village. That's closer. Call the doctor! I'll stay with him. Almighty God, you're sorely testing me... Give me the strength to help this poor man! And help me to... I am dead. I died. Amen. Who are you? Let me die in peace! - A servant of the Lord. Can you move? - No, damn it! Try it! You see! No movement! They moved. - You see! They won't move. No movement in 25 years. Why should they move now? Go away! Leave me to die in peace! Kill me! Kill me! Crush me with a stone! To the hell with it! Excuse me! Does it hurt? So it was no accident? My whole life was an accident. To the hell with this damned world! Why are you interrogating me? Go away! Let me die in peace! Easy now, brother! Stop with that brother stuff! What are you? A priest? I am a servant of the Lord. Then give me extreme unction. I don't have my equipment. I've just arrived here. I'm taking over the parish. I believe it's been vacant for years. - And no one cared about that, either. How were you injured? In the war? Or in a work-place accident? Nonsense! In '56 I caught a bullet. My legs were ruined... During the battles? There were no battles here. Only one shot was fired. Through the window. I phoned around to make sure that the school children would be picked up. An accident at work, you might say. - Do you know who did it? There are lots of candidates. I have enemies even now. Lots of them. For example, the children who go to religious education. They might have got a weapon. Or... maybe a poacher. Luckily no one else has weapons here. Here they poison each other. Where do they get the poison from? - They have it inside themselves! Poison does for everything. You speak figuratively. I'm speaking Hungarian. What else? Should I speak Latin? How late is it now? After ten, probably. Did you call a doctor? Someone's fetching him. No one will find him. At this time he'll be with his whores in the town. Turn the wheelchair round! And give me a shove. Perhaps it'll work this time. Father... Mother! Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... - Hey, Dubina, the green one! Give us this day our daily bread. - Hey, you, help us do the labour hard We pull it, and pull it - ... But deliver us from evil. And move it What wickedness! - Amen. The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle. Brethren, If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from Him, that he who loveth God love his brother. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. It is thus that love, charitable love in particular, is central to our thoughts now. What does this word mean? Saint Paul names its varied aspects in his First Letter to the Corinthians: Love is patient, modest, unassuming, simple, peaceful, unselfish, gentle, pure-hearted, persevering, merciful... and so on. If love means all this, then it must be the name for all virtues put together. Love is the substance, so to speak, from which come the gifts of grace. Love is always a sign of rebirth. In the words of St. John, "Everyone that loveth is born of God, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him." My dear Christian brethren, in our deeds we have strayed far from the love preached by Jesus. We bear grudges against one another and we lack that forgiveness which we daily pray for in our prayers to God the Father. Or are you not like that? When you deny light and warmth to a man who has lived amongst you for more than half a century? A man you've left burnt out, parched and gasping for love, rolling down a long slope to a voluntary death. If somebody says that he loves God but hates his brother, he is a liar. That was the text of my sermon. Free yourself from delusion. Begin a new life, brethren, together with me. Become true, charitable Christians... Christians who dare to love even their enemies for they have nothing to fear. God is with them. They have the protecting might of the infinitely merciful and charitable God and the Holy Spirit. Amen. - Amen. For God's sake! Why can't you leave me in peace? Why can't you let me sleep? Jancsi, dearest. Aren't you coming to bed? I'll never come home from the barracks! I swear it's worse here than there! There at least you know you're carrying out orders. Don't you understand? When you're at home, you think you can do what you want. Whatever you feel like. Sleeping... Don't scream or you'll wake the kid! What? The kid! But anyone can wake me up, right? You say you can't do what you want! You wanted to go to the pub and you went there! You wanted to stay till closing time and you did! You wanted to get drunk, you're drunk! - I was with a friend, all right? You get it? Understand? I hadn't seen him in five years! Five! He's my best friend! How much have you seen of me? Do you want a slap? - You can't give me much else. Don't mess me about! I've got a short temper. - I know. You weren't always like this, when you knocked me up at 16 you were different. Because I'd just got out of prison. My cock was ready to explode. If only I'd fucked the wall and not you! You pig! You dare talk to me like that, you pig! See? You won't give me a break till you've worn my patience thin. Did it hurt? Sorry! Why can't you ever go easy? - Because I love you. But if you love me... why won't you understand that I need some peace? Because I saw that you were having bad dreams and not sleeping well. I know what's good for me. Do you know what I think about day in, day out? You have no idea! Do you realise that my work... - Your work, always your work! Yes, my work! - Your stupid work! It's my work that supports you both. - I work, too! Right! Painting your nails for two thousand a month. And you? You put on your khaki pyjamas and go off to your stupid work. And if you bother to come home at all, you're exhausted or dead drunk. I am a soldier. A soldier is someone who fights for his country and carries a weapon. To protect his people. I have an idea what you're getting at: Faith, hope, love and love your neighbour! Endure in peace! The only thing is, the clergy always used to fatten themselves on love. And the people fought to survive like dogs do for bread. Life in this system is a lot better to be sure. Even you have a little paunch now! And it'll grow, too. Just admit it: This system is much, much better! There's television... Admit it, it is better! I didn't live under the old system. I think a lot of things must be better today. But people still fight each other. You too were attacked. By your wife, even. That is what you said, right? I recall: She once said that she loves me. I wish she'd never said it. But she still stands by you. - By me? It's my pension she stands by. I get three times more pension than she can earn. She stands by me because of the pension. And because it's all she can do. How long have you lived together? - 30 years. And 26 of them in a wheelchair... She exploits my situation. Once I said I'd give up smoking. So she's been hiding my cigarettes from me since. Her grocer brother-in-law has also been told not to sell me any. And I have many enemies in the village. She knows that I am too proud to ask strangers for a favour. Of course, this is all for my sake, so as to look after my health. Course! To protect my pension! Hence the suicide attempt. That's why? That's why. Don't worry, not because I'm a coward or... No. That's really why? That was part of it. You alluded to me in your sermon... Have you got a cigarette? I've got sweeties. - Oh, the nice uncle with the sweeties... Sweeties... love... Alluding to me in your sermon! You know what? Go get yourself another playmate! Catch me! Catch me! Catch me! János! Come to bed! - Must I explain my whole life to you? Give me a drag! I didn't go to the army college to become another Marshal Zhukov! Sorry! I paint my nails for your sake... There just wasn't the money... I will discover new forms of fuel! And then the bosses will see that... I know you graduated as first-lieutenant with honours. It's enough. I don't want you to become a colonel. I wouldn't even mind if they demoted you. And I don't want you to blow yourself up again! Give me a drag. Go get one yourself. Promotion doesn't interest me. The money would be handy, but it's not the main thing. It's not. But we could use it. - Do you remember... Do you remember our housewarming party? I told everyone that I wanted to use my brains. And that's just the problem. If I'd gone to the Soviet Union... - You didn't because of me and Janika... I'm not reproaching you. I never have and never will. I didn't want to. My word is my bond. What false talk! You are not supposed to give your word, but rather your love! Love? What does that mean? Don't I love you? I don't like it when you make me feel helpless. When you hurt me. All is lost. Nothing's lost. Everything is fine. You'll be promoted in autumn, the work is going well, you say. Leave me in peace! - You've almost done it! By New Year you might be able to blow up the whole world. Keep it up. What if I do? What's worth saving, anyway? You're a louse! A louse? Me? - Yes, louse! I'm a louse. You're a louse. Where are you going? Why aren't you asleep? Lie down! Sleep! I have to go, I've something to do for a couple of days. Papa will look after you till then. Everything will be fine. Sleep! Where are you going to? - Budapest. Come on. Stop with your rubbish. You know that there isn't a bus now. Let's talk it over. - I'm leaving. This won't do! Don't you worry about how I get there. Wait for me! Get to base, Comrade Lieutenant. I request permission to leave. - Granted! My Papa... Hungarian. From here. - Where is your Papa? Oh, he is, er dead. Kaput. He has... big castle. Er... castle... no, summer house. Little summer house. Er... Dorogi. Papa. Papa Dorogi. Baron Dorogi. Many fairy tales. Many fairy tales. Is that your car? - Yes, sure. You know where the cake shop is? Good cream cake? Cake. Europe is America Asia and Africa Europe is America Asia and Africa And so I sing my song And so I sing my song Europe is America On the double and... And I'm just standing here And I'm just standing here Europe is America And I'm driving to the country I'm driving to the country Europe is America Asia and Africa Europe is America Asia and Africa And so I sing my song And so I sing my song In Europe and America You're not far away My sense of distance My sense of distance You're not far off Asia and Africa The director? - He's there, in the corner. A cognac! - We've only got dessert wine. Fine. - And coffee? No. A 30-man orchester? In this little village? Natives? - No, no, from Budapest! Johann Strauss. Kálmán Imre. Virág... Virág! Virág sings here! Virág? Who's that? How much is the ticket? I don't know. Ask the cashier. The superintendent, if you please! What film are they showing? A new Hungarian one. - In colour! I'll have, you know that I have the means to get rid of you. JOURNALS GRAVITATIONAL REFERENCE POINT PROPERTY OF THE STATE INSTITUTE FOR GEOPHYSICS DAMAGING IT IS A PUNISHABLE OFFENCE. Well, what's, up, Janó? There's this... priest from the next village. His Trabant broke down. He's here in Mátraszentimre and wants to visit you. Is he down there? - Yes. Show him up. Okay. We are all God's slaves. We can't throw off his yoke no matter where we go. I feel it's better to voluntarily accept His trials. You'll not see much money from these folk. They spend it all in the pub. Right? They spend it all in the pub... There's always drinking going on there until midnight. Go to the priest's car. You say I should go? Let us know when the tow-truck arrives. I have my Trabant from Caritas aid money. How many flowers grow in this churchyard! They seem to like the soil. I came here by bus. By bus? Our Lord Jesus covered areas as large as lands on foot. Didn't you have a Mercedes? - I used to. I donated it for missionary work. There you are. So your family is from Sopron? And who were you ordained by? His Eminence himself, of course. This isn't his diocese! There were some other countries involved. I came here obeying an inner voice. "A scandal for the Jews, foolishness for the Greeks", as St. Paul says. So what is your diocese, then? Oh, merciful Lord. Open up our hearts and our souls, so that we can follow Your call! Take away our lassitude so we can follow with promptitude! Amen. Amen. It's in vain. Under these conditions, one becomes more and more insensitive. It gets harder and harder to hear God's word. And God speaks more rarely to us. God's writing is clear but the lines crooked. We can't do everything alone. We must leave some things to God. If we do so, He will charge us with even more. And He gives us strength to see it all through. When they asked me in Rome to run the... Congregatio de propaganda fide... - You refused that... fantastic offer? I thought I shouldn't run missionary affairs... but become a missionary myself. The land of St. Stephen, our homeland, dedicated for a millennium to Maria, has become a land for missionaries. Taiwan... Japan... Nigeria... How do you like Chinese food? What are you doing? I'm putting this cassette in. - A musical cassette? No, it's got a light-sensitive plate. - What for? To collect the light of the stars. I've got a cine camera. Really? Or are you having me on? - No. Who's it from? Your Papa? - No, from a German boy. Have you made any films yet? Yes. I've already finished two rolls. But I can't look at them. Why not? They explained that to me but I didn't understand them. Bring them here tomorrow! The films and the camera! We'll have a look at them. Okay. Can I look at them too? - Sure! Why do dogs bark at a full moon? - I don't know. Maybe they don't know. Maybe they remember how the first moon fell to earth, sank Atlantis and caused cataclysms. Maybe they want to break out of the vicious circle of canine existence. Why are you the Galloping Coroners? That's just how it is... We came to the name from the conclusion that there's no more life left on earth. Not officially, because life is sponsored, But... humans... human self-realisation... The possibility of... What do you think? - It's like this... The name of the band firstly means... Do you share this view? I can't stand it, being the roof of the universe. It's not enough. Not enough. Everything is dead matter. Everything is a coffin from which the corpse has fled. Life is a wave in the midst of nothing. You're the singer... Man's achievements are superficial, he fights only the symptoms of a deep-seated illness. Deeper than anything else. You aren't alive to crawl about, shit, like a spider. We can't record this! You aren't alive to crawl round and round like a teddy-bear. Live, die or perish. All you have inside is lust, passion, aggression... In one second man can realize all of his potential and leap forward 50,000 years. 50,000 years, if you realise your potential in a second. The fancy stuff has to go! Only nature counts. That's the way to realize your potential. Excuse me, are you the founder member? I am not a founder and not a member of a sect. I am a human being. How long have you been in the band? Since 1956. Since I was born. ...EDUCATION REACHES THE COMMON MAN "WE'VE REACHED THE PROMISED LAND!" Sándor Petöfi "My dear little star, since you've been gone the house has been empty for the little one and me. And my soul is sad. I think a lot about the two of us. I concede that I often and without reason reacted badly to your well-meant attempts. And above all, I didn't take your life seriously enough. But you were so impatient, my heart. The group manoeuvres are soon to end. My dear Marika, come home! You'll see, everything will be fine if we both want it. The group manoeuvres are soon to end. In the future I'll make sure that... "both of us will be at home... on the top of a hill..." "I will be with you both. We will remain together." "With both of you." "I embrace you. Your faithful man... companion, Jancsi." Comrade Lieutenant, the exercises are over. Permission to leave? Granted! "My dear friend! "I have grave problems "that I cannot solve... I need you... "I will soon be in Budapest. If you're not at sea, write to me. "and we'll meet at the Nájlon! Until then, stay cool! János" Wherever I am, the starry skies Look down on me like a friend Wherever the wheels of the carriage roll You're always looking towards me Be it in streets or on snow-capped peaks Be there storms or lightning, my dove Attila! Attila, it's me! Hey! Attila, it's me. Where are you going? Attila, it's me... Can I stay here? - No. Let us finish what's over! I'll fix you up, Attila! The value that is assigned to you... Stop with this Jesus routine! Am I Santa Claus? I am here to work! No one asked you to come all this way. I'm fine without you. - Hear me out! Be fair! Down on all fours! Down on all fours! Down on all fours! Forgive me, Attila! Everything will be as you like. As far as I'm concerned, you can camp here forever! Father, my last confession was a month ago and... I have sinned against God. I have stolen nothing, done nothing. I was at mass every evening... Almost every evening... Except when it was impossible. And there's nothing else bothering you? No, nothing. That's how you regret your sins! - I've been a widow for 21 years. I regret all my sins and promise to be better. I request absolution. Father, I last confessed at Easter. I have sinned against God. Sometimes I failed to say my prayers. My prayers were wrong at the end. And sometimes I didn't attend church. I committed no other sins. I regret all my sins, because I insulted you, God, the all-merciful. I stole, blasphemed, Swore false oaths... took no care. What I stole I gave... I did not give it back. And... I never obeyed the words of the priest.. I committed no other sins. - Drunkenness? Excuse me? - Drunkenness? I went drinking once or twice. That's all. When were you last at confession? Your soul must be very burdened. Forgive me, God, that I... have not sinned. My last confession was in spring. I'm a driller, that's why I can't often go to church. Well, I work day and night, twelve-hour shifts, and I forget to say my prayers. I swear a lot, because I've got two left hands. My colleagues... Well, it happens quite often... that I speak rudely to them. I can't think of any other sins. I regret all my sins, and having offended the Lord. I hope to never sin again. I request pastoral advice. And anyway... Why aren't you in uniform? I didn't think it appropriate to enter your apartment in a cassock. Take a seat. - Thanks. You are right about that. My wife has already heard from the Party that it's not good if I receive a priest. They're afraid that I... will become a church-goer on a Party pension. Well, their fears are unfounded. But it's right, anyway: It's better if you don't return here. Your movements are also followed. God pays attention to you. Doesn't it look bad for you, being friendly with me? The local priest... - The archdeacon? He's not an archdeacon. - I don't really understand such things. I just think to myself that he's... just a weakling. A reactionary. He was almost arrested for giving forbidden religious education. I can't stand reactionaries. I've brought some cigarettes. American ones? No, thanks! These are better. No, please! - Symphonia. From the top shelf? What, you smoke? - Oh no, no. Only because of you. From curiosity. Oh yes? You can't be a reactionary. Just your... fingers are so smooth and thin. Tell me honestly and truthfully: Are you a reactionary or a priest for peace? Well, I'm a friend of peace. As for reactionary, to tell the truth, I don't even know what it means. You don't know? Whoever turns back the wheel of history or prevents progress... is a reactionary. And of course we won't be of the same opinion, our world-views are different. Does this resemble your Lord Jesus? Not much. There were saints and martyrs who looked like him. Saint Ladislaus, for example. Or more still, the early popes. You know, I have even kissed this picture! So. Not when he was officially our father, but when he was got rid of. Without him they'd never have won the Second World War. Never! And yet they got rid of him! I kissed him out of rage. To make sure that someone loved him. Christened with a cross. - It was meant to be pulped. I'll give it to you, if you like. Like Saint Sebastian. To make sure that someone loves him. Love... You've caught me out. I also have secrets. - The Church, too, has secrets. You'd be a good Catholic, just a bit reactionary. Reactionary? Well really! Don't tease me! I almost suggested to you that we... go for a walk. Better we take the air! Did you actually ever try to move your legs? For two years doctors tortured me with their therapies. And the result: Nothing! I know that the first time I met you, you moved them a bit. You remember? You can't remember? Give it a try! Well? Go on! Stand up! Go on! Go on! God da... God in heaven! Aren't you ashamed of making such jokes at my expense? Comrade Stalin... whose flag... will always be victorious... Who's that? Our band. The Galloping Coroners. What do you do? We play. And enjoy ourselves as we do so. Who do you play for? A couple of friends. But more for ourselves. That's the point. Waited too long, the snow is too deep I am too happy, I am in misery Now it has come, the time The future is no longer lost No shame is greater, than waiting in vain Nothing is more vital than rushing Headlong through the wall When everyone rushes, everyone falls Music? Is that what you call it? What? - Come on! A. E. Committee are playing. They don't interest me, okay? Listen... give me a cigarette! Watch out: I'm going to the Europa Kiadó. You coming? Or are you staying here? Come on! Spare me the like in future! Take this. Get in! Fick, fuck, fick, fuck... Licentious embankment Licentious embankment Neutron bomb magazine Fick, fuck, fick, fuck... It peeves, strangles, deceives me. It rips my love to shreds. The whole day I only dream I yearn, light-hearted Friends I have none More, more, Baby! I need nothing More, more Baby! More, more Baby!... More, more Baby! I need nothing Only the bloody, only the bloody Red great love, love, love More, more Baby! More, more Baby... More, more Baby! I need nothing Only the bloody, only the bloody Red great love, love, love Love, love, love... Love, love, love... Love, love, love... It makes you spit It makes you spit Love's come around once again Once again I have moist hands Why? Why? Once again I think only of her Once again I just want to... Why? Why? Once again I see her everywhere Once again I hear her everywhere Why? Why? Love, love, love... It makes you spit! It makes you spit! Love's come around once again Once again I have moist hands Why? Why? Once again I think only of her Once again I just want to... Why? Why? Once again I see her everywhere Once again I hear her everywhere Why? Why? Love, love, love... Give me, dearest, your tender hand! Who knows if we'll meet again? Who knows if my arms will ever again hold your... ... The moon behind silvery clouds A hundred thousand stars glimmer Silvery moon ray A moon's ray shines through the night How my heart hungers for a girl How gladly I'd embrace her... What have we got here! - 85 forints! I've never seen the like! - Oh, thank you. Great shirt! Where did you get it? - You like it? It's from a fashion-show, we each have one. Oh, you're models? It's so exciting, always lively... And here? Is it hard for you? - Well... Could I be a model, too? - Of course! With a figure like that... A bit of make-up, wash your hair... It'll work out! Do you have to sleep with everyone? Nonsense! That's just a story. - Just talk! I thought so. - Yes, just envy... And how much do you earn? - More than you get here, for sure. What do you earn here? - About 500 forints a day. Well, then we'll start working here too! - Excuse me! Two packs of Kent, two of Marlboro, and one of HB for the group, okay? Come over, then we'll talk it over! - We'll help you. The clouds, they cross the broad skies And behind them the heavens are alight Give me, dearest, your tender hand! Who knows if we'll meet again How come you're here? - You were easy to find. You think you can hide? - I thought nothing! What's up? What are you up to here? - I'm working. You call that work? What else? - Do you sell cigarettes and yourself? You're crazy! Come home! But I feel fine here. With that gippo? You think you're Hungarian? There may be Romanian blood in me, too. But I'm no Roma! But you are impotent, scabrous, and lately you couldn't even fuck me normally! Jancsi... - Don't call me Jancsi! What's this, you looking for trouble? - What's this? What's this? Alright, then... Then... then... I'll take care of you later! You know that I could... blow the place to smithereens! You confessed yesterday... did penitence, were washed free of sin, I sensed no relief. Yet you confessed everything sincerely and completely. I didn't say everything. I request pastoral advice. When I told that boy that I'd left my husband, it wasn't quite the truth. My thoughts were repeatedly of him. I kept that secret. And now you're telling the truth! - I even kept it secret from myself. I actually wanted to live with two men. As if one couldn't exist without the other. Yes. I left my husband so as to not lose him entirely. I can't stand to lose anything. That's what caused your lungs to bleed. I didn't sin! You sinned good and proper! You damaged the holy band of matrimony. But I've already absolved you of that. Amen. Amen. It was the only way I could keep Laci. He's the only one I keep in my heart. Look here, take this pin. Look into my eyes! And when you feel that the truth is eluding you, then prick yourself with it. That was too hasty. What did you just say? He's the only one I keep in my heart. I kept him in my heart. I kept him in my heart. Yes, in my heart. Yes, in my heart. I too have a heart. Do you now feel relieved? It's a bit better. Look here... I'll give you this pin. And who is Laci? My husband. - Your husband? This guy, Laci. - And why did you leave him? Because I can't live without him. Help! A bit of focus. Indiscretion! Dome. Cupola. I am the world. And you? The focal point of the universe concentrated on itself. A worm! A worm in focus. I have no condom against the world. - Well, take me along in your spaceship! The skies seem to be clearing... They are suddenly pure and transparent. From the lake a trumpet calls. On the edge of each lake is a conifer. Primary ones even have several. If you want to look at yourself in the lake, you hear trumpets. The closer you come, the louder they are. And before you see your face, the water foams and it's full-moon. I want to have your child. The priest is everything to everyone but has no one. And were it otherwise, it'd only open up wounds. The secret of our reality is conserved searching. An... active inside, like a dilated magnet. What? - You heard correctly. Don't pretend to be a vipera aspis! Catch me! Catch me! Shall we call the priest? - That's only for the living. Excuse me. She's been completely obsessed with that stuff recently. What things? - She often saw him several times a day. Whom? The priest? Which priest? - The new, young one. Young? Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This evening we're singing you this song with Marietta. Marietta... is singing it for the first time this evening... now. Love's come around once again Once again I have moist hands Why? Why? Once again I think only of her Once more I really want to... Why? Why? Once again I see her everywhere Once more I hear him everywhere Why? Why? Love, love, love... It makes you spit... It makes you spit... Which one's your stud? I have none. Are you sleeping with the whole band? I sleep with no one. Don't lie! I'm not lying. And anyway it's not your business what I do. Oh no? And the child? I've been saving. Next month I'll rent an apartment. And? - And then I'll send for the child. No you won't! I'm the mother! - And I'm the father! The child belongs at home! It's not a home to any of us anymore. You weren't often at home, anyway. You left! Come on, the boss is waiting. - One moment. No, really come on! You have to come! Don't harass me! Come on, come on! You have to understand that I do what I want. Okay. Jancsi, don't be angry, I have to go. - Okay, go then! I see the camera's running. I'd like to ask about the concert... A few people will be there, not more. - Make yourself at home! A huge home, but... How do you feel now after the concert? I don't get why no one's drinking. - To and fro... No one want a drink? Everyone makes for the fridge... I say explicitly... - Before the fact it's... I'm speaking with the Galloping Coroners... here in the "Young Artist's Club," after their concert. That's why you paint yellow stripes... - And then the next step: We have to try not to cover up these things... You should... - That's a yellow stripe... Sorry? - All the music is in this matchbox. I want to say what I want to say! That's what I want. Your music, then, is the size of a matchbox? Not always. Sometimes yes, sometimes no... That's all Czakó wants to say. But he can't. He can't! I can't... - It's inside. In the magical... Aah... - Tomorrow it'll be... Aah... - Please give me a... Either a big palace or you chose the other one... That'll be your most recent composition. What's its name? Stop! Stop! What did you say? But say it! Say it...! Say: Aah! Say... Wait a minute! Wait! - Wait! No! No, I'll never take her back. Never will I take her back! - Whom. What are you on about? She's in here! I... Who's in there? - She is! Here! Here! She was here. But she... Inequality of will and representation! You needn't maintain the balance because you're the officer! If you're no officer, then take off your uniform! That you don't want! Waiter! - Well then? Here, look! For a guy like him... What? - Him! Little school girl ... the flowers sit... on your... - In the light of the rising sun... There at the lime tree... - There at the oak... I wait so often for you... - I have waited... There we were happy. On the bank of the old Tisza - Let go! Smelling the scent of the lime tree - Let go, waiter! Do you remember, my love? - Let go! There we were happy... - Waiter! "On the Road" wishes you a good trip. Sadly we have no good news. What are you doing here? - Excuse me! I'm going to work. You're a musician, right? - What makes you think so? I saw you in Budapest with my wife. - What wife? The new blonde singer. Remember? Oh, the blonde frog! You won't find her here! - Then I know your son! Who? - Your son. He's often at the observatory. He helps me, we chat... You work at the observatory? This is a long-distance connection This is a long-distance love It is indeed! That's what I need! Well, what's this? Do you know him? This time it worked out. - What did? Last month he was more clumsy. Oh, I see. Where can I find a phone? - Stay here! I'll take care of this. Well, what's this? What's happened? I came on the 7:50 bus. I think that the astronomer... Well, how does it look? - I'm having the church watched. I've only just got back. No one's seen him since yesterday. Fine. Keep looking! - Will do. I don't like that God-botherer. He regularly meets with two people. Following which the woman in the sanatorium stabs her heart... with a hat-pin. And this old-timer... commits suicide... Suicide. Two suicides on one day. No witnesses. And the priest vanishes. Well... You regularly attend church, right? I'm very religious. Can I say that? I went to church when I was still a child. And I'll carry on till I die. - You still go? I still do. And what was your impression of the new priest? We got very fond of him. So fond that... Wasn't there something strange about him? No. No. No. - Nothing strange? And did he talk about politics? - No, not at all. No. Never. His hair was.. shaggy, but otherwise he was decent. He did lots for the church. Although he was new. Well... I didn't know him at all. Only recently. Since he came here. And since then, how was he? - Well, pretty bearable. Bearable? Was there nothing strange about him? Didn't you notice anything? Yes, I did! - What was that? He didn't preach the way he was supposed to. No? How did he preach, then? He would sometimes skip a word or two. - A word of two. Do you know the... From the... thingamy, the epistle. You don't mean you know it by heart? - I do. Did he speak about politics? - No. Never? Not even outside the church? He never talked of it. - And drank? Excuse me? - Did he drink, the priest? Was he a boozer? - No. No. At the altar, he'd always... - Communion wine? He always mixed the communion wine with... With palinka? - With a drop of water. And that's how he drank it. - Ah, that's how. I see. He was virtually a saint? He still is. - Is he? The good priest would always push Uncle Miklós in his chair. And the priest would always let go... - Let go? Yes, and Miklós... - Downhill or on flat surfaces? Er, mostly... downhill. Downhill? - And the priest would have to catch Miklós, because he was afraid. And did he? - Yes. And what happened then? Then... There... Then they went away and I didn't see them anymore. What time was this? Was it already late? Well, er... Around seven. - Around seven? You're still out and about at that time? Yes. Does your father know? No, no one was home. - No one. I see. Listen, kid, I don't buy your story. I even recorded it with my super 8 camera. A super 8 camera? You yourself? - Yes. And where did you get it? - I got it from tourists. Got it? Yes? Didn't nick it? - No. No? And what else... did you see on your rambles? Down at the mine... these UFOs... What? - There were UFOs there. UFOs? - Yes. What do they look like? Like two saucers one on top of the other. Yes? Two flat saucers? - Yes. And did they fly? - Yes. They flew away from there as I was playing. - And... when you saw them fly away, what did you think about? It was as if I were standing on my mother's belly. There, between her legs... between her legs. As if I am there... were there. As if you were there. - Yes. It was very soft. You felt that when the UFOs flew off. - Yes. The story sounds a bit confusing to me. UFOs don't exist! And why were you at the mine so late, anyway? You should have been at home! For fun. - For fun? What do you know about the priest's relationship to Uncle Miklós? Well... Their relationship was good. He spoke to him, it wasn't bad No? - No. What was their relationship like? - Well, quite bearable, decent. What did they do together? - Well, they spoke together. And. Were they often together? Often? - They were often to... together. And everyone had seen this? - Yes. It wasn't just in the evening. - It was mostly in the evening. Mostly in the evening. - Evening. And where did they go? - Between seven and eight. Yes? And where did they meet? - There in Bagolyirtás. Where? - Bagolyirtás. Where is that? - That's there... Down in Bagolyirtás there's a slope. That's where they played. Did you play too? No, I was collecting nuts. And I saw them. And did the priest often push Uncle Miklós like that? Yes. - Yes? Often enough. - Often? Every evening? Always? Not always, sometimes. Every two or three days. But always in the evening? - Yes. And did he always let go? - Yes, always. And then catch him again. I see. And what did Uncle Miklós say then? Uncle Miklós... He didn't say anything, he was just very afraid. And he told the priest to catch him. I see. And when Uncle Miklós was found was the priest anywhere to be seen? He'd been missing for days. No one saw him. First time here. First time. Good air, hm? Good air. All film. Good? Who did the filming? - Sometimes Olli did... The German? - Yes. And sometimes I did. Or we asked someone else. All film. All. Okay. Now for the cake shop? Cake? Okay. Music, hm? Europe is America Europe is America Did you also go to church? Pioneers don't go there, you know? - I know. That was their castle, but now they have nothing left, the poor dears. Don't tell me you've been abroad! - It wasn't me. Olli simply left the film with me. Aha. With you. Who are these people? - Attila. What Attila? My friend. - Your friend? Yes. - And where do you know him from? I often go into the observatory. And then we look at the stars. And the moon. He works there? - Yes. That's a punk band! Do you know what punk is? I do. - What is it? Well, it's when they jump all around the place. Yes? Aha. And who took the film? - This one? He did himself. Himself? - With my camera. Where was this filmed? - I don't know. Is that of Olli or Attila? No, I don't know. What's the porno in aid of? - Sorry, boss. It's case evidence. - Oh yes? Yet there were moments... that even seemed strange to me back at the time. He didn't know the Salve Regina. Every seminarian knows it! Maybe even you do. - Maybe. And yet... The faith that he exuded I found very contagious. I'd go further. I'd even say, he moved me. And what was the thing about being a missionary? He said that he... felt he had a vocation. He said he wanted to become a missionary. To go to a distant country, and take his mission to the people. The natives. He explained to me, that he thought that maybe he could best realise these aims in this land. I understand. Do you know anything about what relationship he had to Miklós? Nothing? Fine, thanks for having come. Goodbye. Go with God. Did something happen? - No, nothing. Nothing. On the contrary, everything is alright. I was able to complete my mission. Then I'll go and get changed. Almighty God! - Almighty God! I thank You. - I thank You. Because You allowed me to do my duty. Because You allowed me to help. Amen. - Amen. In my last dream, St. Francis Xavier appeared to me in a shower of gold. The wall opened up, in his eyes dull jaden lights shone. At his command, cherry blossom... IBUSZ-travel? - Lorry. In Constantinople friends are expecting me on a ship. I now only need money to pay my passage. But in hard currency. That's all. God will pay it back in kind. Like last time. You are listening to "On the road." Sheer weight of traffic on the Budapest... S-9000 to T-90! We've got a report: In the Mátra region a confidence trickster impersonated a priest. There were two cases of suicide. Both victims were closely associated with the popular priest. The priest disappeared without a trace. In both cases, murder... Hey, that's the priest from our village. The man in question is between 30 and 40, tall and black-haired. He is presumably in a cassock or a dark suit... IN SEARCH OF THE FAKE PRIEST MYSTERIOUS DEATHS "Police treating case as potential murder." "They are looking for a tall man between 30 and 40 dressed... in a dark suit... ... conspicuous, angular movements." If only I were a kamikaze If only I were a kamikaze If only I were... Are you a priest? No. - I recognised you. Then fine, I'm a priest to you. I wanted to say... I was so frightened... Run away! I called the police. Nineteen hundred and ninety-three, thirteenth of August Hard to say if it's Friday I am alone Hard to say if I'm alive Now I am entirely alone Now I'm alone, quite alone I'm flying alone Now I'm flying alone... The sewage system of the capital is in part over-worked. Which is why, in the vicinity of Rózsavölgyi underpass... Did you see nothing? - Let's try it! Okay, good. But my things! In the area of Váci út, progress is currently very slow since the tram lines there... Traffic control... Good evening. An ambulance, please! My wife is going into labour. A birth you say? - Yes! Quick! Last time it went fast. Your name, please! - János Szabó... What do you want here? - To have your child! What do you want here? - To have his child. Yes? Stay there, young man! Damn it! Stay where you are! T-90 to 00-Zero. Two suspicious women are following a suspicious man. S-00-Zero here. Leave the women be! There's been ten reports of the fake-priest in the fifth district. Good evening. Come quickly! Good evening. Bring lots of cars. There's been a bus accident, lots of casualties... 17th district, Dózsa György út, and be sure to wait on the Baross utca junction. Lots of casualties, around thirty... S-00-Zero here. S-00-Zero here. T-90, come in! Hey, that's forbidden! This isn't a race track. - Leave it be! Attila! I want to have your child! What? - What do you want? From me? - I? I want that? What do I want? It's like this: one... - One, two, good things come in threes. Where are you? - On the blind spot of your soul. Four. S-00-Zero to T-90. We received a report from West Station. S-00-Zero to T-90. T-90 here. - Head quarters! Where are you going to? Hey there! Attila! Attila, it's me! Did you see him? - You again? -Go to the devil. Did you see someone running along here? I did. I did. I didn't. Yes, I did. I did. I didn't. What's that? Came in as urgent? Here S-00-Zero. We followed every trace of a clue. Who are you? - I want to confess something. Who are you? The girlfriend of the roommate of the woman with the pulmonary illness. What about her? She died. How? I killed her. How? Let's go over to one side. Chef, a dubious couple... How? - I went into her room. She was praying again. She was always praying. I hit her on the hands: "What? Praying again?" What? Are you praying again? She had the hat-pin in her hand that you had given her. It penetrated her heart. What do you see in that device? Animals, people, houses. A man doesn't nose around, you know? A man act, thinks. You can read, can't you? - Yes. "Zhukov". That's my book! "How the Steel was Tempered." My favourite book! Come with me. I always read it when I was a schoolboy. I'll send this device to the person that you got it from. Okay? Still want to be a hussar? - Yes. I've got a surprise for you. Press this button! ATOMIC POWER IN THE SERVICE OF PEACE AND PROGRESS And now the other! Well, what do you say? How do you like it? And now the other one! Come on. Come on, do the fourth one. That's it! Come on. Well, come on! Come over here. Well, what do you say to that? Well, what do you say? You'll be a hussar like that one day. You see? Oh, and you'll be seven years old! No eight! Eight? Fine, come here! Then this here is for you! Come on! Well, what do you say? Come here! You see? Still want to be a hussar? - Yes. Jancsi Pilinszky recounted a dream in the year he died: On Golgotha the crowd demand of the crucified one that He get off the cross and prove He's God's son by performing a miracle. All are watching the Saviour in excitement. No one sees that the thief on the left quietly descends and creeps off home. Mankind awake from your deep dream!
