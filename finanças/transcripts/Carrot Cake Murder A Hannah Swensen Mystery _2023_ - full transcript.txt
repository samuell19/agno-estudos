Down and out... Yeah, let's jam It’s gonna be a really good night. We’ll close off the whole place for the party. Oh, Eugene. You’ve gone all out. Hey, nothing but the best for the Rhodes family. Oh. I owe them. Are you kidding me? Come on. If anything, I owe you. You’re kidding me? His father gave me my first job. Really? True story. Now I was thinking we could set up the birthday cake right over here. - Great. - Oh, perfect. And, uh... your mother's favorite is carrot cake, right? Yours is. And, uh... it's a big birthday so, you know, we want a big cake full of candles 'cause we all know she's turning... Whoa! No. Nu-huh. What? Oh, Norman. You are such a dear man to want to celebrate your mother. It is a rare and admirable trait. Whoops. But there comes a timeless point in our lives when numbers are unnecessary. Right. Carrie does not need a forest of candles. No, absolutely not. You know what? I just... Understated. A little mystery. Oh. Who doesn’t like a little mystery, huh? Oh yeah. Do you just keep that in your purse all the time? So, I will pick up your mother tomorrow for our girls’ night out. Perfect. Thank you so much, Delores. It's three days before her birthday so she should be surprised, right? I think... Absolutely. Well, I’ll be here an hour before to help set up. And we’ll be ready. Bye Norman. Bye Mother. Wow, you really wound my mother up. You did it on purpose, didn’t you? Ah... maybe a little. But she’s right. You’re doing a nice thing, Norman. Oh, we don't get the family together nearly often enough and I definitely don't see Eugene enough, so... Oh, wow. Save the Steiner! Save the Steiner! Save the Steiner! Save the Steiner! Wow, so this is the rally for the Steiner. Yeah, I guess so, huh. Save the Steiner! Save the Steiner! Oh, Michelle’s back. Oh, yeah. She just got back into town. She’s looking for a place here so she can stay here in between jobs. Huh. Save the Steiner! Save the Steiner! Pardon me, I’m coming through here. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. Save the Steiner! I hear you. Save the Steiner! Okay. Alright everybody! Guess what? The Steiner lawyer and the developer are in court right now. They never even gave a chance for local developers to put in a bid. Yeah, they wanna tear it down. We’re trying to save this building. Save the Steiner! I can’t believe they’re gonna destroy this building. Well, not if the committee has their way. I hope so. Fingers crossed, right? I mean, it’s the last Leo Steiner Building in town. - Hey. - Hey you. I got here just in time for the fun. So, what’s the word? Well, you’re hearing it. Nobody trusts the developer Wyatt Avery. Also, apparently he’s a lousy tipper. Save the Steiner! Save the Steiner! Everyone, please! Hi, I’m Diana Graves, and I represent the committee to save the Steiner. That’s your Diana? Um... yeah. Well, I don't know if we're there yet but, um... yeah. Yeah, that's her. The court has just issued an injunction barring any further work being done until they’re able to hear arguments about landmark status for this building. That hearing will take place in two weeks. Nothing can be done here until then. Right, Detective Kingston? Uh, yes. Absolutely, everybody. You heard it here, nothing is getting torn down today. That means you can all go home. Thank you so much, everybody. Great job. Thank you. Now, please do come out... - I'm gonna try get more shots. - Okay. ...so that you can support the committee. That was some rally. It’s something. Hey kids. Hi. Party planning? Shh! It’s a secret party we’re planning. Oh. Hey Mike. Uh, excuse me guys. - Yeah. - Sure. Bye. - Hey, there she is. - I got some pretty good shots. That's Norman's Diana? I mean, he says they’re not there yet, but yeah. So tonight? I only have leftovers. Only you can make that sound good. I’ll do my best. Okay. We need two dozen red velvet cookies for Rhonda Sharf’s Mahjong Club. Already done. Thank you. And, um, I think that’s it for the custom orders so we should get the crew on the regular stock ‘cause I’m working on the project we don’t talk about. Oh. Got it. Hi. I just turned around and you were gone. Yeah, yeah. I had to get back to work. Hi. Oh, no... sorry. Oh. Uh... Diana, this is Hannah Swensen. Hannah, Diana Graves. I know you by reputation, of course. Oh, it’s all good. And also, I am addicted to your deconstructed Rocky Road Bars. True story. Thank you. Have a seat, I’ll get you some. You were so impressive out there dealing with the crowd today. Do you think you’re gonna be able to save the building? As long as we can get it officially landmarked. Which should’ve been done a really long time ago. But Leo Steiner was a world-famous architect, it should be easy to get landmarked? Normally it would be. But... Five Star Renovations and Equipment did the 1995 renovation and it was really shoddy work. Oh. So there is a decent argument that it damaged the structure enough that the building needs to be taken down. You took the case. Well, I’ve never met a hopeless cause. Mmm, well... Norman! I’ll fight for it. Speaking of... I have a brief to write. Oh, my gosh. And I have two cavities in the next 20 minutes. Right. Yeah. Bye. I’ll see you tomorrow. Thank you for the brownies. Yeah, yeah. Any time. They're uh.. Rocky Road Bars. Well, she is... Genuinely nice. I was gonna say smart. And lovely. Well, good for Norman. Yes, it is. Who’s gonna break it to Mom? I think it should be me. Just be nice, okay? And gentle. Oh wow, those are cool photos. Thanks. I’m gonna print some of the best ones and make a carousel for the Eden Lake Sentinel’s Instagram page. I think it should read, “Rage in the heartland: The struggle is real”. Nice people save famous old building. Yeah, see this is why you bake. There’s no drama. What? Clearly you have never botched a carrot cake before. Neither have you. Michelle is right. I don’t botch a cake these day. There’s a precision to baking. Proportions have to be exact. You measure. When you find the right combination, the right proportion... truth is, you tend to stick with it. And I love that certainty. With baking. But once in a while... I really wanna stretch. Be surprised. Try my hand at something completely new. This is so good. Um... can I take the rest of these for work tomorrow? Oh yeah. Ooh, not that one. - Mike... - What happened there? That one doesn’t have seasoning, it’s Moishe’s. Wait. What? That’s Moishe’s plate. Moishe has a plate? He’s been having a rough time lately. Still jealous? I gotta go. But we just made dessert, Mike. I know, it looks amazing. But, um... later. Mike. Bye. Aww. I can explain. Mike is just learning, huh? And I promise you he will never replace you. Here you go. I’ll open some tuna. I feel so good Gotta knock on wood Surprise! Oh! Isn’t it? Wait, wait, wait. Where’s Mom, is she on the way? To Bimini. This explains it all. Well... everyone, I have an announcement to make. It seems that our Carrie decided at the last minute to take a trip for her birthday. Eight days, seven nights, five islands. But I am sure that I speak for her when I say she would be thrilled to see you here and that you all came to celebrate her. So... thank you very much. Enjoy! - Norman. - Yes. This is so Carrie, isn’t it? I know, isn’t it? Here's your... Thank you. So great and weird. Well, that is the last time I plan a surprise for anyone, ever. I’m sorry. Hey guys. Eugene, Hannah, stop working this second, please. The party’s started. Come on, I’m gonna do a toast. Let me get a glass. Hey, wine only for you, Eugene. Don’t worry, I’m not getting sick tonight. What? Oh, he spent New Year’s Eve in the ER one time. Yeah, I didn’t know there was rye in the office party punch. It turns out I’m allergic. Ooh. Oh, yeah. Hey, do you remember Mom let me bring my, uh, lightsabers into the hospital room? You remember? Yeah, you stood guard. Aww. I bet. No one can come in. Hey. I’m gonna do a little toast here. Oh, yeah. Okay. Let me... Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention real quick. Um... I just wanna give a quick toast to my mother, Carrie who is the best, and let's face it, the only reason you all came this far to celebrate. Uh... may she continue to surprise us. And, uh... may she stick around for another... Ooh! Nope. Uh... for many, many more birthdays to come is what I was gonna say. To Carrie! To Carrie! Hey. Who is that? - Um... - Allow me. It’s your party, Norman. You don’t have to do this. Ah, don’t be silly. I don’t mind at all. It’s nice to get some fresh air anyway. You are grace under pressure. You really saved the night. I think your mom’s acceptance speech really set the tone. Right. Well, you know, she can be... Whoa! Hello? Hello? Everybody okay? Hello? Is there anyone here? What was that? Was that an explosion? It sure sounded like one. Do you have your flashlight? Oh, look, there’s a light here. Hello? Did you see that? It’s a light. Hey, yeah, you're right. There is someone down there. Hey is everybody okay?! Hello? Hello? Is there anyone down there? Norman, what’s that smell? Ugh, it smells like gunpowder. Ugh, look at all this smoke. Yeah, this is definitely the source of the explosion. - Wow. - Careful, careful. What is that? Uh... probably the bottom of the elevator shaft, I think. No. Norman... what is that? Whoa. Well tell Avery this is not a request, this is a summons. So... an accident? Well, we’re not sure. I mean, there was explosives there, there was other stuff that we told Avery to move and he didn’t. I’ll make sure he’s in first thing tomorrow. Yeah. Hannah, you wanna sit down? No, no, I wanna listen. We found bone fragments and remnants of tarp around what was a body. Any idea who it was? Clothes were partially preserved. Found this. Jerry McDowell. Hey, uh, Mike. I also wanted to say that we saw a light downstairs. Some of the workers’ lights didn’t blow. No, no. It was moving around. There was definitely someone down there. Yeah. For sure. Okay, thanks. Well, let’s look into that. Will do. Thanks Lonny. Um... I am probably gonna be here for a while. Why don't you and Norman head out and then you guys can come by the station and sign the statements tomorrow, okay? We gotta find out who that guy is. Well, I work with some people that can help with that. I promise to keep you posted. Okay? Okay. Okay. - Let’s go, Hannah. - Yeah. Bye, thanks. Do you remember the name Jerry McDowell? Jerry McDowell was a thief. I remember now. He was never violent, just a low-rent felon. He disappeared after Landry’s Jewelers was robbed out in Skelton. That was July 1995. Wow, my first year on the job. Everyone assumed he ran off and never came back. Do you have any proof that he did it? Well, we have it now. We found an antique brooch in his pocket. And here is the inventory from the Landry job. Let me see that. Looks like the brooch was the most expensive thing taken that night. Yeah. He kept it separate, kept it for himself. What about everything else on that list that was never recovered? Well, this is quite a list of missing items. Everything from a simple silver necklace to that brooch. So, yeah. Where is everything else? They didn’t find any other jewelry with the body. Here. Can you make three copies for me? So, did he have an accomplice? Jerry usually worked with someone, yeah. Any... any suspects? Statute of limitations has run on that burglary. The case is closed. There’s no time limit on murder charges. So far there’s nothing to say it was. Wait. Are you saying the guy just fell asleep in the bottom of an elevator shaft? No. But there’s no damage to the skeleton that the ME can say happened before last night. Now, I talked to the DA about it first thing this morning. Without forensics there’s no way he can bring a case. We can’t waste time or resources on a dead end. Find out what or who caused that explosion last night. That’s the case you need to solve. What do you mean there’s not gonna be an investigation? I think the man was murdered. What does he think? That he just slipped and fell under an elevator and nobody noticed? Hannah, I don’t think that, Ealing doesn’t think that. He just said the DA won’t move on it. There’s nothing to prove at this point. What about his family? I mean, they’re gonna have questions. Hannah. I’m the choir. I also have direct orders. Okay, I get it. That means no murder investigation for you. But... you can have a cookie. Yes. Now this guy Jerry... Oh. You’re on a first-name basis with him now? He was a human who happened to be a thief. That means that he had a police file. Hannah... What? It’s a closed case, isn’t it? And I’m a citizen, I have rights. I could file an open records request. How do you even know about... Do you have any idea how long that can take? - Here you go, hon. - Thank you. I do. And it would stink to have to wait that long. I take lunch at noon. Come and get me, I’ll be busy. You can wait in my office right next to the stack of files on the left side of my desk. Got it. Okay. I promise I won’t do anything risky and I won’t get in your way. - Oh. It’s for you. - Thank you. Here you go. Hannah? You gotta tell me why. Because. I bumped into a skeleton last night and I have questions. And Mike... that guy deserves justice. And you think so too because your mouth is doing that twitch thing. What? You wanna know just as much as I do. I do. So if you wanna check it out, I’m not gonna stop you. You mean it? You mean it? You’re not gonna hold back information and you’re not gonna scold me? What? Yes, I mean it. But I... I'm curious but I have to investigate Wyatt Avery and the explosion, you know that. I’m gonna need access to the crime scene. And if you keep talking like that I’m shutting this whole thing down. Oh, you’d better get used to it. Because I am just getting started. I have to get back to work. Over here is where the foreman said he was sure the blasting caps were stored securely. No way anything could happen. Yeah, right. But over here is where the Fire Marshall found trace evidence of the caps. Look at this. Oh... blasting caps kept in a cardboard box. Definitely not secure. And no evidence of a locked cabinet where the caps should’ve been stored. Now the question is what set them off? That. An old heater. Fire Marshall is gonna run some tests but... thing's older than dirt. And if somebody left that plugged in anywhere near the blasting caps then... That’s the Marshall’s theory. Well, I think it’s time we escort Mr. Avery in for a nice friendly interview. - Sure thing. - Okay. Hi Mike. Hi Lonny. Hannah. It’s been secured and cleared by engineering, it’s safe. Did you bring your own gloves? Yeah, I got them from my kitchen. I use them when I’m peeling chillis. Okay. Same concept, right? So here it is, this is your, uh... crime scene. Did you just do air quotes? Maybe in my mind, yeah. You don’t take me seriously at all, do you? I got you in here, didn’t I? Norman called me this morning. Norman? Calls you in the morning? Diana has a whole file on Five Star Renovations and Equipment. Oh, the company that did the ‘95 restoration. And she said they’re a pretty shifty bunch and I think they put this elevator in. Okay. Just don’t pick up anything too heavy, just be careful. Got it. I'll be careful. Oh! What? Hello 1995. Is that a pager? Yeah. It’s definitely worth checking. Here. Put it right in there. Nice. Just be a little bit more gentle. Okay. Okay. Yeah, right. Hey! Mike. Look. Let’s see. Yeah. We might be able to pull some DNA or some prints off of this. Here, just open that bag for me. Could those be Jerry’s keys? Could be. I’ll see if any of the workmen lost a set of keys too. Oh. Yeah. Good find. Hey, what's this? What is that? I’m not sure. Maybe a... piece of fabric or... or a necklace from the robbery. I know. It’s a belt loop, right? And then this would be a wallet chain. Oh yeah. I had one of those when I was 12, it was very hip. No 12 year olds are hip, Mike. What? Nice. Okay. Maybe there is something in this. Anything? Well... Avery says he's got no idea how it happened. He was sure everything was stored correctly. If it was one of his employees, he'd file charges himself. What would he have to gain? Yadda, yadda, yadda. Is the building unstable? Apparently no, it’s okay. Well, with this accident there’ll be injunctions and delays no matter what. Agreed. And he doesn’t strike me as being that short-sighted. And just his luck, this explosion throws up a buried corpse. Yeah. What are the odds? Hey Michelle. Any luck finding a house? No, not yet. Why, do you want me out? No, I love having my sister here with me. Ooh. For the record, I am not the one that tore up the pillow. Mmhmm. Yeah, I figured. It’s the chaos, it’s upsetting Moishe. You know, I’m out all the time lately and I’m engaged to another man. But we’re working on it. Well whatever you’re doing is clearly not working. What’s all that? These are the things we found at the crime scene and this is the police file on Jerry. This is the guy. Yeah. Jerry McDowell. Look at that mugshot. Hmm. So, what now? I have no idea. But I’m gonna figure it out. Mmhmm. First, I have to figure out who Jerry was, right? Who he knew. Who he was close to. Who might’ve wanted to kill him. What if he was married? Ooh! I know that one. Shameless hussy. Is that a name? It’s all Vera ever called her. And who is Vera? Jerry’s mom. According to Mrs. Howser, Vera always blamed “S-H” for Jerry becoming a degenerate gambler. And she was fooling around on him. You got all this info without cookies? No, we were in The Cookie Jar. Well, that’s great. Okay. Oh, it says here his wife’s name was Julie. Do you know if she’s still in town? I do. She left town just after Jerry disappeared and no one’s heard from her since. Wow. Look at this. Look at this. She had Jerry declared dead seven years to the day from when he disappeared. You took Hannah Swensen into that building. Are you scolding me? What’s she doing? Wait, don’t tell me. She’s what, investigating? Stop her. Hannah has got a mind of her own. I couldn’t stop her from asking questions if I wanted to. You like your job? Keep her in line. Who’s this guy? Travis Gardner. He and Jerry were arrested together twice before, both times for grand theft. And then there was a robbery. July 15th, 1995. The police were convinced it was Travis and Jerry working together but they couldn’t prove it. Jerry had disappeared and Travis had an alibi. Hmm. It's funny, his face seems so familiar. He... Can I look at your photos from the Steiner rally? Sure. Okay. Nice. That’s totally him. I mean a little heavier, but definitely the same guy. I remember this guy. He was yelling something about no bid contracts. So Jerry’s last known accomplice is still living in town and hanging out at the Steiner Building? Can you believe this crazy weather? Oh, and Lisa... I added raisin drops to the menu for the assisted living delivery tomorrow. We still need two cakes for that. What are you thinking? What about if we did the Cocoa Fudge? Crowd pleaser. And maybe we do the Scandinavian Almond Cakes. It’s lighter. Perfect. Oh! Hi Diana. Free cookies for life for this. Well that’s not a very good business plan. Right. Don’t worry about it. In there are copies of everything I was able to pull on Five Star. I knew they were shoddy, but burying a body? I was finally able to get a full list of employees yesterday. It’s in the back. Wow. Okay, well you have no idea how grateful I am for this. Cookie? Always. Hi. Pat. Hello. Hannah. Hi. Oh. I’m sorry, I’m just finishing my lunch. I can help you in 20 minutes. I’m so sorry to interrupt your lunch but I do just have one quick question. How could you find me? Your assistant loves my Raisin Drops and she reminded me how much you like the Viking Bars. Oh. How can I help you? Okay. I found these keys and I just wondered if you might tell me what that number on them is. Is that, like, a serial number? If these are master keys that might be the serial number but if these are just regular house keys that’s the bidding number. What’s that? The instructions for how to cut a duplicate, that’s all. Sorry, Hannah. Oh, no. That's okay. I mean, they're 25 years old. I couldn't expect... Uh, no. Those keys aren’t 25 years old. Why not? Look here. Um... you see that? That's the, um, the WT... that's the manufacturer. It stands for World Truman and they went into business in, like, 2012. 2012? That means these keys... These keys are not Jerry’s and they can’t be the killer’s. Well where we found them and how dirty they were, it’s not likely it’s the EMS team. So, maybe the workmen? Or who sabotaged the building, if it was sabotaged. Hey. Good work. You’re welcome. Hey, your, uh, witness statement from the other night... Oh, yeah. ...is all ready. Are we having dinner tonight? Well, it depends on how the investigation goes. I might be late. Really? Remember this moment the next time I’m working late... please. Are these Peanut Butter Cookies? I know my customers. Hello. Can I help you? Yes, um... is this a summons? Something about collecting my ex-husband's body? Julie McDowell. It's Julianne Carlson now. And... and please, tell the Sheriff that I want nothing to do with this. I’m Detective Kingston. Wait right here. Both the Sheriff and I would like to speak to you, okay? I’ll be right back. Ms. Carlson, I’m Hannah Swensen. I’m so sorry for your loss. Thank you, but it was a long time ago. Right. Yeah. Of course. I... I, um... I'm the one who found his body. And listen, I’d really like to help find out what happened to Jerry. Why does it matter now? Honestly, I do not have time for this and I don’t want it. It’s not my problem. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to make things worse. You didn’t. Are you late for work? No, I left a new girl in charge at my spa. Oh, wow. You have a spa here? No, in Howell. I left here to get a fresh start and I don’t want anything to do with my past, okay? Well, it’s great that you could start your own place. Do you know how rough it was after Jerry left? I worked full time at Pierre’s Salon and ran a cash register at night at a mini mart. I saved up. I did too. I have a bakery. They say chocolate is good for stress. Mmm. Those are very good, thank you. Oh, yeah. Not a problem. Ugh. It was such a big deal opening my own place. I was shaking when I signed the lease. I had no idea what I was getting into. Me too. I almost panicked. It must be so tough to start over. But I wasn’t starting over. You have to understand, I had nothing before. And I’ve built a life for myself now. But whatever happened, Jerry was no victim. Okay? I mean, he was a nice enough guy most of the time. But he couldn’t keep himself out of trouble. Did he deserve to be murdered? Is that what they’re saying? The cops think he was murdered? No, not exactly. Right. Okay, listen. You seem like a very nice woman and I know that you’re just trying to help. But Jerry’s mom is gone, there is no family left. Nobody’s been looking for Jerry for a very, very long time. You don’t need to do this, okay? Thanks. What’s all this? Well, I went to City Hall and got the blueprints for the Steiner Building, ‘cause I thought it would help me figure out what happened. And I have a whole file on Five Star. - That's a lot of paper. - So much paper. Now, um... most investigators do work with someone. Well, I would love that, but I don’t wanna get you in trouble. It’s okay. - Wait, really? - Yeah. Okay. - So... the heist happens. - Mmhmm. Then what? Okay. Then they split up. And they agreed to meet up at the Steiner Building. So Jerry was there waiting to meet up with his accomplice. Good. That’s one very possible scenario. What’s another one? Another one? He could’ve been killed somewhere else. And the killer brought his body to the Steiner Building, threw it down an elevator shaft to hide it. Yeah. Michelle just got the address for Travis, the accomplice. Hey, meet me at the Chameleon Bistro. I’m having lunch with Mom and we can plot a strategy. Delores must be loving this. Well, she doesn’t really know about it yet. So, what are the odds that there’s an accidental explosion in the exact spot that hits a missing body? It's like a bullseye too. Which means... Either Avery did it and had incredibly bad luck... Or whoever killed Jerry staged the explosion. But why would they do it? It’d just expose the body. Expose the body first. Right, because of the new construction it was eventually going to be revealed. So maybe they wanted to get to it first to... what? To, um... get it out of there maybe? And if that's the case then you interrupted them, so... you gotta be careful. - Okay. - Okay. See you later. Hey. Eugene. Hannah, hey. Was the Chameleon Bistro open for business in July of 1995? No, not yet. Huh. But you were here getting it all ready? Well sure, I’m sure I was. Yeah. And, um... did you get a look at that construction crew that was working on the Steiner Building next door? Five Star Renovation and Equipment. No, I had nothing to do with those guys. Really? ‘Cause someone told me that you worked as a security guard at the Steiner for Five Star. Hannah. Come on, like I had time to look after that place. Look, I had my own business to get up and running. Right. But, um... did you ever see, uh, Jerry McDowell? What? Who? No. No, I didn’t know that guy. What about Travis Gardner? That wasn’t my crowd. Which crowd? Both. I heard about both of them. Didn’t they both go to jail or something together? Yeah. Your mom’s here. Hannah. Look, I’m sorry, okay. I gotta get back to work. Right, of course. Why are my daughters attracted to detectives? And not dentists. Is it the danger, girls? If so, you have to fight that urge. I told her about our double date stakeout with you and Mike and me and Lonny. Why would you do that? Look at her, she believes you. Mother, she is just making that up. She’s yanking your chain. Oh, what am I supposed to think? And why are you in the middle of another murder case that you are trying to hide from me? You are avoiding commitment. I don’t do that. I mean, you’re not married yet, which I do not understand. Now? It’s just another terrible example you’ve set for me. You can sleep on the porch tonight. She does make a very good point. Why do we never talk about the wedding? We talk about the wedding. We’re talking about it now. In fact, Michelle and I are going to a spa to see if it’s right for the bridal party. Party? As in multiple bridesmaids? Sure. Can we talk coolers and dresses? Well, I... I hadn't really thought about it. Ooh, time and money saver. You can just have all the bridesmaids wear the same ugly bridesmaid dresses that they made you wear to their weddings. Oh, that is diabolical. Mmhmm. So, nothing matches? Well, I kinda like that. Oh! Second hand bridesmaids? Oh Hannah, your priorities. I’m working on that too. And now she’s crying. This is all your fault. Mother, stop it. Carry on. People can see you. Let it out. Hello Eden Lake it is time for weather on the fives. Enjoy the sunshine today, because it’s be another wild weather week. Temperature drops throughout the day, snow and sleet tonight. Then 20 degrees warmer tomorrow. So layer up. Hello. Working on some wiring, huh? It’s a boat. Always something to work on. Right. Can I help you, ma’am? Are you Travis Gardner? I am. What can I do for you? Well, I was hoping you could help me solve a riddle. I’m sure you’ve heard by now that they found the body of Jerry McDowell. Actually, I’m the one who found him. I’m sure that must’ve come as quite a shock to you. I haven’t thought about him in years. They found some jewelry with his body from the Landry theft. So now they know for sure that he was a part of that. I told the cops back then I had an alibi. Right. It’s in the case that you said you were at the movies and that you had a movie ticket stub to prove it. And I still have the movie ticket stubs to prove it. After all these years? You’re still here asking. You wanna come in the house and see them? No. No, I’m good. I don’t know what happened to Jerry. That’s all I gotta say. Hey. I just got the ME report. The pant fragments found with Jerry’s body were blue jeans. The belt loop we found was definitely from a different kind of pants. They must belong to the killer. Might. Might belong. Who else? We don’t know, that’s all I’m saying. You gotta build these cases piece by piece. Gardner’s Construction? You know what Mike, I’m gonna call you back. Okay, bye. Hi. I’m Hannah Swensen. The cookie lady. That’s right, that’s me. You’re Joe Gardner? Yeah. Dad doesn’t have a sweet tooth so I know you’re not here delivering cookies. Yes, um... I'm sure you heard in the news. I'm the one who found Jerry McDowell's body. And...? Well, I wanna figure out what happened to him. Dad doesn’t have anything to do with it. He did his time back in the day and he’s lived a good life since, okay? Don’t bother him. I don’t wanna bother anyone. Your dad’s lucky to have a son like you looking out for him. No more than he did for me. Dad pretty much raised me by himself. I was a handful. Got into a lotta trouble but he never bailed. He was there. Did everything he could to keep me in line. That’s who he is. These are really good. Thanks. Thanks. Um... this is where you grew up? Uh, no. Dad bought in ‘96. He worked hard for it. I saw him working on his boat. He loves doing it. He, uh... he gave me that one last year. Rebuilt it himself. Wow. You must love it. Yeah, I spend all my free time on it. Your dad must be really proud of you. I hope so. You have a lot of people looking for you. I got 10 projects going right now, so... I get it. Look, this is a good man. So, just please, leave my Dad in peace. Chances are if something happened to Jerry in the Steiner it was an accident. You see the bottom floor of that place? It was a mess even before the other night. Five Star was a lousy contractor. Mike said it was... oh, here we go. Ah! Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry to startle you. It’s okay, Eugene. I’m sorry, I’m just a little jumpy. Do you wanna come inside? Yeah, please. This weather’s so crazy, right? Whoo. Thanks. I just wanted to apologize for being so short. It was a hard time for me back then getting the place ready, I was under a lot of pressure. Of course. You know, opening up the place and stuff. Yeah. Down there is where I found his body. Should’ve never happened. What? Look Hannah, I need to tell you... Hannah, watch out! Eugene! Eugene! No! Oh, no! Oh, Eugene! Are you okay? Oh! Eugene, I’m getting help. I’m gonna get help! It’s gonna be okay! You’re gonna be okay! Norman, what did the doctor say? Well, they induced a coma to help the swelling in his brain subside. We won’t know anything for a while. I’m his emergency contact. They kept asking about next of kin and bugging me for insurance information before they do any more tests. Oh. Hey. What if he has, like, an insurance card... No insurance card. But, oh... would his social security number help? Yeah. I mean, it could. Depending on who the carrier is. Do you know how to look up insurance? Okay. He’s in the Weill Proctor health care system. They have a nationwide database, so that’s good. Um... Wait a second. This can’t be right. Eugene Crenshaw died 50 years ago in Madison, Wisconsin, when he was three years old. No, there must be a mistake. Maybe there was a typo when you put in the... Maybe. Let me just... No, it's coming up the same. That's, that's the... Norman... Okay, wait. I better, um... uh... I'm gonna go take care of his hospital bill. I should just go let them know... Norman, are you okay? I don’t know. I know I shouldn’t say this, I mean, the man saved my life. But... do we even know who Eugene really is? He... he's Eugene, I don't know. He's... he's been around all my life. He comes to Thanksgiving every year. He's the one who taught me how to throw a curveball for Little League. He was family. Yeah. You know, Dad offered to invest with him when he wanted to open up the restaurant. But Dad never knew how he was gonna afford it. I mean, he was just a super for some of Dad’s buildings. Eugene wouldn’t take Dad’s money. Do you know if he got a loan from a bank? I don’t know. Why? Well... I was talking to Eugene earlier and he seemed off. I found out that he had been a security guard at the Steiner Building in 1995 during the construction. And when I asked him about it, he lied to me. So when I was asking him about that, and I asked him about Jerry, he started acting really strange. And then he followed me to the Steiner Building. It was like he was trying to tell me something. But then... this happened. Okay. What are you thinking? That Eugene isn’t Eugene. And we don’t really know who he is. And maybe we should tell someone. I don’t know what happened. Eugene just sort of yelled my name and then the next thing I knew he was pushing me out of the way. Well, I hope he wakes up soon so I can thank him... for saving your life. I hope he wakes up soon too. I had deputies seal off the Steiner again until we know what caused the collapse. So... I won’t go back in there. I promise. Okay. I just think it’s strange. Jerry dies and all of a sudden Julianne has enough money to open up her own spa while she’s working at a mini mart? I think the word spa is doing a lot of work there. Like, maybe it’s a chintzy nail parlor. Oh, there it is. Oh. Point taken. Hmm. Duck! What? It’s Travis and Julianne. She was at the Steiner protest. Why are we whispering? That’s very interesting. We should get outta here. What? You promised me a manicure. - I'll paint them myself. - Hmph! 0-7-7-3-4. Turn it upside down. If it was a pager it would say hello. Jerry’s pager? You got it to work. I got it to turn on. Wow, look at this. So tell me, what do you got? Okay, well... she got a photo. I haven't printed it out yet. Julianne talking to Travis on the street outside of her spa. And when I talked to Travis’s son, he was so quick to tell me how his dad had cleaned up his life years ago. Well maybe it depends on what he means by "cleaned up" and "years ago". Right. But he did buy a house in 1996. A year after the robbery. I mean, I’d like to know what that down payment looked like. You mean how much of it was cash? Yeah, exactly. Although he would’ve been smart to sit on his share for a while, let things cool down a little bit. Mike, that is three people around Jerry who came into a lot of money after his death that can’t be explained. Travis bought a house, Julianne started her spa, and Eugene opened a restaurant. Does the physical evidence put any of them at the scene? Well... Well, that’s what I mean, then it’s the killer’s. All we know is that it's not Jerry's. That's it. And wait... again. Alright, well I put a question mark. Okay. Speaking of the keys, did you talk to the EMS team and the construction crew? Nobody reported missing keys. Of course, if I was a killer I wouldn’t report the keys missing either, I would just replace them. I did a background on the construction crew and nobody’s got any ties to Jerry. I’m still taking one last shot at trying to get some trace evidence off those keys though. So... just means that Eugene is the only wild card. The pager, that’s what I wanted to tell you. The pager stored the last four numbers that called it. Three of those numbers were disconnected. The last one was Eugene’s, his landline. He paged Jerry the night of July 15th. Eugene lied. Yeah. About a lot. Hey. So... what's the verdict? Even if Eugene had a second job, there is no way he could afford the restaurant. This is... Well if he’d been using a false identity, there’s no way he could get a loan from the bank either. You’re right. So who is he? Oh, ah... I gotta run. I have to feed Eugene's cat before my afternoon appointments. You have access to his house? Yeah, it’s a garage door opener. Oh. No. Absolutely not. Meh. Store bought. Patches? Pss-pss-pss-pss. Norman, let’s look first and then you can feed the cat. Okay. Uh, well, I do have to feed the cat. I mean, it's... Okay, yeah. We’ll definitely do it. Pss-pss-pss. Patches. Patchy, patchy boo boo. Norman! Norman, I found it! This is it. I found it under his desk. Whoa. What? Oh, my gosh. This newspaper clipping, no ID on the paper but Hickman High School. There can’t be that many of those. No. Look at those skinny kids. So young. Do you think that’s Eugene? I think it is. Oh... a birthday card. To my favorite uncle. Love Natalie. Does any of this make sense to you? No. No, it doesn't. But, uh... it will. What has she found, Kingston? My fiancée is staying out of any active investigation. She’s running around like some podcaster interviewing people? Julianne talked to Hannah and she wouldn’t talk to us. I’m telling you right now, she gets results. If she gets results then we should know about it. Write it up for me. Is there enough to charge? No, not yet. Then stick with the sabotage. That’s a case we can make. And if that gets you Jerry’s killer, we’ll take him. You really do love this detective stuff, don’t you? Well, you're the one putting it all together. It's just... it's hard to let it rest, you know? I do. But you’re not gonna hang up your oven mitts, are you? No. I love The Cookie Jar. But... Hey, when did that burn out? - Can you...? - Yeah. Oh. Well, here... You’re gonna get up on it? Yeah. Hannah! Whoa, whoa, wait! What? Step down. Step down. Okay, you alright? Yeah. - Um... - What? Mike? Just look the other way. I got a unit on the way. They’re gonna dust for fingerprints and see if any of your neighbors have security footage. What? Hannah, what is it? When I went to see Travis, he was working on the wiring of his boat. You and Michelle cannot stay here. Okay? Don't even try... No, no. I’m not gonna argue. We’ll go to a hotel. No. I was thinking about some place with a serious alarm system, maybe even a moat. I do know just the place. Alright. Now tell me about this art project of yours. It’s evidence, Mother. Of bad taste. That is cheap polyester. I should’ve known to ask her sooner. With all things fashion. That was a woman on a budget. Why do you say woman? Well, look at the sheen. Almost a... a teal black. It's definitely from a woman's pair of pants. Oh, in the ‘90s men wore those hammer pants. Bright red, peacock, teal, plum, paisley. We all did, honey. Okay, so they could've been men's pants but if they were women's... Julianne? I mean, maybe she and Travis were working together? You know, Jerry’s mom always thought Julianne was having an affair back in the day. Ooh. And who is Julianne? So many questions. We need intel but she’d see me coming. We need someone she’d never suspect. Mother. Hmm? Can I treat you to a manicure? Ooh! Ooh. You need me to go undercover? Looks like my bodyguard can’t handle baker’s hours, huh? You want some coffee? Yes, please. Mike, you don’t have to do this. The bakery has that fancy alarm system, remember? Hmm. Mike, you know what’s bugging me? That sounds like a trick question. I mean about the case. Hmm, shocker. Seriously. They seem like three decent people who have lived good lives for the last 25 years at least. Am I bringing up memories when they don’t deserve it? Not if one of them’s a killer. It feels like I’m spinning in circles around all three of them. What if it’s someone else entirely? What if I’m missing something? Then you just step back and look at it from another angle. Another angle. A new angle. Hey, uh, Lisa. Could I get the keys to the Cookie Jar van back? Of course. You know what? Uh, I’m gonna do the morning deliveries and then I’m gonna go to WKXN. So I’m gonna be gone for most of the morning. What’s at WKXN? A different angle. Whoa, your purse must weigh a ton. How many sets do you have? Well, the house, Herb's business, Cookie Jar, my truck, Herb's van... summer cabin. Oh! Cookie Jar van. Oh, thank you. But Eugene was there. I don’t see him anywhere. He got there late so he’s not in the footage but he was there. And that’s Travis’s son, Joe, right there. Girls. Couldn’t you wait until I’ve had my coffee? Sorry Mother, but I bribed a PA at WKXN and I got the raw footage from the Steiner protest. Ooh, good girl. Scoot. I realize I need to start with the explosion and the protest and work backwards. All three of our suspects were at the rally. Why? Civic duty. Or panic. Panic. Exactly. The killer knew that the Steiner Building was coming down. They would realize that Jerry’s body was gonna be exposed, and along with it probably evidence that would incriminate them. Unless they could pulverize him first. Oh, you are my most gruesome child. But she’s probably right. Save the Steiner! Save the Steiner! Save the Steiner! Oh my... Julianne and Travis together? That’s Julianne? Mmhmm. Where are they coming from? Well, from the back of the building. I mean, there’s an alley entrance around that corner. You think they were in the building together? Why would they be? If they wanted to make sure no one had found the body they buried. That’d be a good reason. And then they blend into the crowd. Mmhmm. Except not really. I just don’t buy that Julianne set off that explosion by herself. But maybe she had a boyfriend who could. Huh. Bad fashion and bad romance. I can spot both from a mile away. I will get your answers today at the spa, Hannah. And... I will pick out the palette for your bridesmaids' manicures too. She’s actually enjoying this. Should we be worried? Mmhmm. Ha! - Hello. - Hello. I am desperate for a manicure but I don’t have much time. Oh no. You know what? My girls are all booked for the next three hours. But I heard you’re the best. Are you sure you can’t squeeze me in? Uh... Alright then. Is there another business that you could recommend? Alright, come on. Over here. - Thank you. - Have a seat. Thank you. My nails are a mess. I will take care of you, don’t you worry. I’ve been cleaning out a closet that I swear is the isle of bad fashion choices. Ah. It’s like, what are those cards? Awkward family photos. So embarrassing. Oh please, there are no words. Definitely a possibility. At least. Julianne goes around saying she doesn’t want anything to do with her past and then I see her talking to Travis outside of her spa. And she basically came out of nowhere at that rally with him. And he knows his way around construction. Okay. Hannah, maybe we go to Ealing with this. No. He already said there’s not enough evidence. We are only taking it to him when I have the entire case sewn up. Okay. I had hammer pants. Bright red. - Ouch. - Mmhmm. Okay, I would not have guessed that was your style but I am sure that you were still the hottest thing in the club. Well I’m sure that you were much more tasteful. Well, I did stick to black, but they were shiny parachute pants. So many zippers. Oh! Uh... sorry. It’s fine. I’m supposed to be at work. Is everything okay? Yes. Actually, that wasn’t work. I’ve gotten myself into a tricky situation. Romantically. Oh, I’m sorry. You know, we have all been there, Delores and this table is the vault. Nothing you say will leave here. My husband’s business partner. You know, you would be shocked how many times I’ve heard that. Well she didn’t admit to anything but I could tell. Miss Julianne definitely knows her way around an affair. So did you get any proof? She owned parachute pants. Ooh. I could break her on the stand. That is not how any of this works. So... what's my next assignment? Nothing. Just come home. Don’t hang around there. I’ve gotta go get my nails fixed, Hannah. This color is horrid. The sacrifices I am making for this investigation. My mother is out of control. Michelle was just at the bistro and, uh, she said the rumor is that they’re gonna bring Eugene out of the coma soon. Wow. Well, one way or another, that man is going to wake up to a very different world. How do you mean? Check this out. Chandler Meacham lived in Bellin, Wisconsin. I got an address on the house, did a search on it. It’s still owned by his daughter, Natalie Meacham. The birthday card. Yeah. Eugene’s her uncle. You should call her. Now the phone company came through. I pulled LUDs on the last phone numbers to call Jerry McDowell’s pager. One was Vera McDowell. One was Travis Gardner. The other was the Pierre Salon, I think that’s the wife. She and Travis were in touch a lot. Behind Jerry’s back. Could be. Anything to narrow this down? Well, Vera was the only one to call after midnight on July 15th. So, she didn’t know about Jerry’s death, but what about the other two? They could have. Is there enough circumstantial evidence to make up for the forensics? No, not yet. Alright. Stay on it. And Mike, keep Hannah on a short leash. So, your Uncle Eugene is, uh... Ellis. Uh, not Eugene. He’s my Uncle Ellis. He ran off when I was a kid, the year after my mother died. Why did he do that? He was drunk and had an accident, a hit and run. He abandoned his car, left town and nobody heard from him again. You must’ve been so young when that happened. How did you know all that? There was an article about it in my father’s papers after he passed. It was an open and shut case. The whiskey was all over the floor of Ellis’s car. It broke my father’s heart when Ellis disappeared. Natalie, that accident could not have been Eugene’s fault. He’s horribly allergic to rye, he couldn’t handle a drop of whiskey. Never mind a whole bottle. Something else happened that night. But only Ellis can fill in the blanks for us. But... he's in a coma. It’s been medically induced and, um, if you’d be willing to stick around for a little while, the doctors are going to bring him out of it soon. Having an uncle could come in handy. And the Eugene I know, he’d make a pretty great one. Do you think she’d give Eugene a chance? I don’t know. I hope so. Where’s Norman? I gotta buy that guy a beer after all that. Oh, he stayed at the hospital. He just wants to be there when Eugene wakes up so he can talk to him. - Hey. - Hmm? Listen. I think... I think it's time to step back from this. What? I haven’t nailed it down yet. We’re close though, we’re really close. But it can’t go on like this. Why not? I mean, it hasn’t been that long and it’s a cold case, right? Mike, I really think I can solve this. We got the same three suspects and nothing puts one ahead of the other. I know. But maybe I should just go over it all again, you know? Wait. You’re leaving? Why didn’t I think of this before? Maybe because it’s a terrible idea. What are you talking about? Cinderella. I know exactly how to figure out who the killer is and I just need your help. Okay. So, we’re not gonna go in, I promise. We’re just gonna see if the keys fit. And basically we’re just trying to find their rightful owner, right? So that’s your story. They look like house keys. Don’t they? Or office keys. And one is definitely a top lock. That’s the point. Bottom line is whoever these keys belonged to is most likely the person who sabotaged the Steiner Building and they’re probably also Jerry’s killer. Well we can’t say either of those things for sure. That’s why we’re doing this. We have three suspects and we know where they live and we know where they work. Ah. And we can check Eugene’s house off our list. Anyway, what’s the harm? That someone wants to harm you. Mike... I know you would never let anything happen to me. You’re in the hospital. Hello, Ellis. Yeah, I know your name and I’ve heard some stories. I don’t know if I should believe them. I can’t imagine how hard it must’ve been for you. Having to hide who you really are. Always being afraid of being found out. There were years where you had more time for me than my own father. So, I know, that we weren’t wrong about you. About who you really are. Okay, we... we really need to discuss your embrace of the criminal life because I'm a cop and I can't go rattling around people's doors without probable cause. No, no, you’re right. You’re right. It’s dangerous, you should wait in the car. - Wait, what? - Never mind. These keys don’t work. Let’s go. Come on, man. You owe it to yourself and to everyone who has ever called you a friend to speak up now. Right now. What’s going on? My brother called me late one night... drunk. His wife had just passed. He went out. Wrapped my car around a tree. And he hit someone. He was crazy then. He had Natalie to raise. And he couldn’t go to prison and he couldn’t run. But I could. So I did. He had my car so cops would just assume. But I made him promise that he’d never drink again. And that he would take care of that precious little girl. I left that night. I ran northwest. Bought myself a social security number. And Eugene Crenshaw was born. Natalie? It broke my father’s heart when you disappeared. He missed you. He wouldn’t say a word against you. But I never understood how you could just leave like that. Natalie... I understand everything now, Uncle Ellis. And you’re not disappearing on me again. Why didn’t you just tell us that you knew Jerry McDowell? Is he the one who lent you money for the restaurant? No, but he knew a loan shark. And he offered to get me a birthday present for Natalie. Jerry was supposed to meet me on the 16th but I never heard from him. Travis dropped it off instead. I'm sorry. Natalie, I'm so sorry. Me too. Hannah, this is crazy. I think I found it. Julianne’s home address. Oh, that’s Norman. He says Eugene’s awake. It’s Travis. No. No. We have to. It’s just the last stop, Mike. Hannah. I’m sure one of these keys is gonna fit that top lock. - I think we're gonna... - Now just stop right there. Hey. Where did you get those keys? They were found in the Steiner Building. Near where Jerry’s body was found. No. No, that’s not possible. Will one of these keys fit that lock? Yeah. But it's not, uh... Look, I did my best. I was trying to make it better for us. That’s it, drop the gun. Drop the gun. Down. Right now. Step back. You don’t need those. It was me. What were you gonna say? Travis Gardner, you are under arrest for the murder of Jerry McDowell. You have the right to remain silent. What were you gonna say? ...can and will be used against you in a court of law... I, uh... I did it. I killed Jerry. Take him away. He seemed so surprised by the keys. Yeah, he was surprised we had them. No, no, he was gonna say something else. He was gonna say something different. Mike. A word? So, we've got the pager, the wallet chain and fabric for evidence now. We'll need any pictures that the sister took. So... It’s a good thing you kept me in the loop on this, Mike. Are those the keys? Tell me you haven’t let them out of your sight. I have not. You, uh, need my notes too? No. I’ve already got Mike’s status reports. But thank you Miss Swensen. You did a good thing. Did I? You let me think we were gonna go to the Sheriff together when we had enough evidence. - Now, hold on a minute. You were giving him status reports? He found the evidence bag, he wanted updates. He’s my boss. And you two were just... laughing about me playing detective this whole time? No. He just couldn’t have you running around, doing all this unsupervised. Unsupervised? Okay, that was not the right word. Has he been following us all afternoon? Absolutely not. I sent him a message right after the text from Norman. Sure. Hannah. We needed help. He had a gun, any cop would’ve called for backup. Of course they would’ve. You think that’s why I'm upset? Please, just try to see it from my perspective, okay? Hey. Don’t. Mike. Just get a ride from the deputy, okay? Hannah. Lonny told me about the fireworks last night. It was a great show. Just all show. Wanna tell me what happened with Mike? Nope. I heard Travis confessed on the spot. Yeah. You don’t buy it. I just don’t get it. I mean, I thought the whole point of these rubber things on the keys is that you can tell them apart, right? You’d have one color for the top lock, a different color for the bottom lock. Why are they all the same color? Okay. Well, maybe he had a set for his barn and a different set for his house. Maybe he had a bunch of different keys. I’m gonna make us some tea. Who has a bunch of different sets of keys? Ten different jobs at once. Hello? Hello? Is there anyone here? Running is not the answer, Joe. What are you doing here? You told me about your boat, remember? Going on a trip? I don’t have time for this. How’d you get involved with the Landry robbery? What are you talking about? You wanted to follow in your dad’s footsteps? I don’t have to explain anything to you. How’d you end up at the Steiner Building? Give me the keys. I’ll give you the keys if you give me some answers. We’ve built good lives. And you ruined everything. Is that why you tried to kill me? Why you tried to electrocute me at my own house. I wasn’t trying to kill you. But I had to stop you from finding out. That you killed Jerry. We got into a fight, that’s all. I earned my share of that loot and Jerry wouldn’t give it to me. But I didn’t mean to kill him, okay? I was just an idiot kid. You threw him down an elevator shaft. You just left him there. You should’ve stayed out of this. You shouldn’t have come here. If you leave now, your dad goes to jail for the rest of his life. You don’t know it, do you? He confessed. Your dad is gonna spend the rest of his life in prison for what you did if you run now. I didn’t even keep the money. I left Jerry’s share on Julie’s porch. So your dad didn’t know? He wasn’t a part of what happened? No. Absolutely not. I never even said it out loud until now. Look, that night scared me straight. My dad never pulled another job either. Alright, time to go. You could’ve called. I did. I called 911. Hannah... look, you were right. I was. I am. So this is it? You know I was right too. Hey. Hey. I was just at the hospital checking on Eugene. He’s doing much better. He and Natalie have been catching up. Oh, that's... that's so nice. So, still working there, huh? Yeah, Joe Gardner pleaded out to manslaughter. He told the whole story. According to Joe, Travis never even wanted him to be part of the Landry heist. Something must’ve gone wrong. Yeah. Joe got dragged in, thought he deserved part of the loot, fought with Jerry. Says the killing was just an accident, he panicked and... hid the body at the bottom of the elevator shaft. Yeah, he pretty much told me the same story on the dock. I can’t imagine what he was going through. He’s lived a good life for 25 years. He panicked. I mean, he was gonna lose everything. You read the whole thing right. Everything. Except me. I sort of feel I nailed that part too. Not if you think I don’t respect you or what you can do. You were stringing me along, Mike. You lied to me. Stringing you along? Hannah, I was encouraging you. I was trying to help you. At the same time I was trying to save my job. It was a tough spot. You didn’t think I could understand that? You didn’t trust me to tell me. It wasn’t that. I didn’t wanna disappoint you. I’m not your child or your parent. Can you be my partner? I asked you to marry me. That’s not an answer. Yeah, it is. Hannah, I understand that you’re mad. I’m not mad. Mike. I'm not mad. I'm... You’re disappointed. We’re both wrong. We’re both right. And maybe that’s why we never got around to actually planning our wedding. No, that’s ‘cause you hate any event you don’t get to cater yourself. Fair point. You know you can’t stay mad at me for long. To bake bread correctly you have to respect each ingredient. Don’t underestimate the ratio of yeast to sugar. Baking bread has always been my go-to comfort in the kitchen. When I’m unsure, the simplicity helps me figure life out. Bread is only five ingredients. It’s simple but it’s not easy. The trick is kneading the dough. You stretch it, you work it, then you stop. You have to let it rise on its own. If you respect the process, you could end up with perfection. To the best detective in town. Oh wait, do not encourage her. Me? You were so into it. I was good, wasn’t I? You were very into it, Mother. You get it from me.
