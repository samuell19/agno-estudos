Subtitles by explosiveskull Babe? Babe? Babe? - Good morning. - Mmm. Anyway, yeah, I'll put it away, here. See? Yeah. You're not paying attention. I'm sorry. Yeah. Wait. Angela, you don't even know what that is. Neither do you. And that's why I'm not eating it. Something's wrong. It's a $1,000 camera, and the piece of shit doesn't even work. Can you take it back? No, it was a wedding gift. For who? I bought for us, Ange. It's the weirdest thing. Oh the, um... That thing is still... Oh... Ah... I was thinking... No, babe, I really don't want to. Oh, we should do it tonight while Maddie's at the Petersons. I told you, it makes me uncomfortable. Being with me makes you uncomfortable? What you're doing right now feels like nails on a chalkboard. Oh. That's, that-that's weird, but okay. We can always delete it. Well, okay, my mistake. Please? I want to make a movie with my new bride. I don't want to make that kind of movie. Oh, come on now. No, stop! Did you have fun at Stacy's house? Mrs. Peterson doesn't let us do anything. That's not true. It is, Dad. Well, if she's overprotective, it's because she's been through a lot, just like you and I have been through a lot. You know what I mean? - Yeah. - You're safe inside. Ange? I'm sorry. Um... Did you say something? Can you take Maddie to school? I made you a roast beef sandwich with mayonnaise, and a pickle. Is that okay? Yeah. Oh, I also put some blueberries in there. And some chocolate Kisses too. I didn't think you'd mind. My dad doesn't want me eating that kind of stuff. Well, it's not gonna kill you. That only happens to animals. I think. Why? I don't know. I guess their bodies can't handle the stimulation of the chocolate, you know? And then their heart stops beating. Is my heart gonna stop? No, sweetie. No, your, your heart is not gonna stop. You won't tell Dad? Your dad doesn't have to know everything, sweetie. Part of being a girl is being able to keep secrets. - Hi. - Hey. Just a moment. Are you guys using new chemicals or something? No, ma'am. You don't smell that? Is that just me? I don't smell anything. Oh, maybe I'm a little sensitive today. Okay. Um, payment? Oh, gosh. Yeah. Spare change? God bless you. God bless you, too. Hey. $42 for the gas. Sorry for the hassle out there. We put up the signs, but it's all we can do. It was no bother. You shouldn't encourage him. Oh, it's hard enough to ask for help as it is. Whatever you say, lady. Um... Can I have some cigarettes? Some, uh, Camel Lights, please? Sure. I don't really smoke. - I - don't really give a shit. Maddie, go to your room. What's going on? Didn't you hear me calling? I'm sorry. Angela... Why didn't you pick up Maddie from school today? You left her there for five hours. Angela? Angela. What's wrong with you? Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, babe. Look, I didn't mean to, I'm sorry I yelled, okay? I'm sorry. What happened? Why didn't you pick up your phone? I'm sorry. I was reading. I must have lost track of time. Please don't be mad at me. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's some good stuff, babe. Did you do something to the spare bedroom? I painted. You painted? No particular reason? Kind of. Please ask before you start changing things. I need your help around here. I gotta know that Maddie's safe and sound. That's the extent of what I'm asking. Okay. Are you having second thoughts about this? 'Cause you can tell me. I'll never do what she did to you. Where would I go, anyway? They've been deposed? The cousins too, right? Uh, what's her name, and uh, what's her name. Yeah, 10:00 a.m. sounds great. All right man, see you then. What's depose? Uh, it's where you have to tell the truth without lying. Thanks. Are you picking me up today? No, Angela will get you. Did you get enough sleep last night? Try and take it easy today, okay? Oh. Yo, what's up? Yeah, no, I'm on my way out the door right now. Uh, I've got the files, yeah. I'm going to take a writing workshop. A class? Don't you already have a degree in writing stories? I'd like to do it. How much? A few hundred, I think. You're sure you're up for going back to school? I feel fine. It's just a class. Maybe you should rest, is all I'm saying. I mean, you were painting the bedroom when you were doing your third color? My second. Cute. I just think you need some down time. If you wanna go back and learn everything you've already learned, knock yourself out. It's Daddy! Really? Did he see us? No. You know your dad loves you very much, right? Yeah. When I met him... I knew that he was the man I was going to marry. He was so nice to me. And so confident. And yet, he was like, the loneliest person I've ever met. He was sad in a way that I wanted to make him happy. Everyone said we rushed into it, but you have to do what you feel, right? Whatever that means. Are you coming? Where are you going? I need your help picking out some new wallpaper for the bedroom. Would you like to do that with me? I can't. Why? I have to go to school. It's just a couple of minutes. I have to go to school. Come on, sweetie. No. Okay. Suit yourself. Do you need help? I'm telling my dad you wouldn't take me to school. Do you remember what I told you about girls and secrets? Do you know what happens if you tell? You go to the secret place. That's where my mom used to put me. I'm sorry for what I did. I've been very sad this morning. Last night, your dad was telling me about your mom, and I got so upset because I just don't understand how she could leave you, knowing that she'd never see you ever again. And now you're gonna have to go through life just like your father, always wondering if anyone ever really loved you, you know? Do you have more edge pieces? No. You sure? That's how you build the foundation. Dad? Yeah? Did Mommy ever say why she wasn't coming back? No, sweetie. Why are you asking me that? You remember what I told you, right? You remember how I told you how she hurt us? Yeah. I think we're doing okay. Whoa, fuck! Baby? Are you okay? Something I ate. But you didn't eat, though. Can you get me a towel? Yeah. Here. - Thank you. - You okay? You asked me that. So do you think that we could finish? Seriously? Oh. Sorry. Yeah, sorry, I guess I'll just take care of myself. Seriously... Fuck! What the fuck, Angela? What was that? I don't feel very well. I might have overdone it today. Can you help me change the sheets? I gotta get up early. What are you even doing? I was watering some plants. Okay. Did you have the nightmares before you moved in? No. And how long ago did you move in? Four months ago. Wow. That's a lot of anxiety. Yeah. Where were you living before that? I had an apartment while I was in school. Oh. 'Cause it says here that you were on Zoloft and Paxil, as a teenager. I stopped taking it, right before wedding. Why? Fresh start, I guess. Fresh start? Okay, but then what? Is that why you got married? No, I-I got married because I met a man. I mean, that's, that's what you're supposed to do, right? Does your husband know? And does he understand your condition? Okay, new environments are tough. It takes time to adapt. It seems to me that you're just a little wiped out with all the recent activity. I guess. So what else is bothering you? How did you know? That's why you're paying me the big bucks. You remind me of my old therapist. Oh yeah? Let's talk about you and your family. It says here that your husband has a daughter from a prior marriage. Tell me about her. You getting out of bed today? Hey, what'd the headshrinker say? He said to get more exercise. Well, amen to that. He say anything else? I really didn't ask him that many questions. I think you should see a real doctor. You don't look well, babe. Okay. So you'll make an appointment? Sure, yeah. But I need to talk to you about something. What? I'm worried about Maddie. Why? She lied to me the other day, sort of. About what? It was, it was stupid. And you wanna tell me what it was? I went to the cabinet to get some chocolate Kisses, and when I opened the bag, they were all gone. And I know for a fact that you don't eat anything like that. So she had some chocolate. It's not gonna kill her. No, but when I asked her about it, she said she didn't. And, I could just see that she was lying. You know how sometimes you can just tell? She is her mother's daughter. This is the way it starts, you know? Who ate all the chocolate Kisses? What are you drawing? A tornado. You wanna tell me what happened to the chocolate? What chocolate? Maddie. What'd I tell you about lying? It's worse than dying. It hurts people. Especially the people who love you. Angela was very hurt by what you said to her. I didn't do it. In that case, go to your room, now. Dad. What is it? Hey. Babe? Hey. What's wrong. Dad, look at her face. Go back to bed, Maddie. Are you okay? Go to bed! Hey, come on. How'd you get out here? It says sleepwalking can be caused by sleep deprivation. Or, stress. On a scale from one to 10, how stressed are you? About a two. Usually a three. I mean, it's fine. Get me a refill? Yeah. So you're saying this sleepwalking thing never happened before, like before we met? I mean, is there anything you're not telling me? I'll try not to do it again. How can you control it, if you don't even remember doing it? I think it's exhaustion. I think what you need is rest. What are you doing? I'm gonna take Maddie to school today. Okay, you're going to the fucking doctor, today, Angela. I'll make the appointment. I have to go to school! Relax. It's just me. I used to be a little girl once. Not that long ago. I was a lot like you, in a lot of ways. I was quiet. I loved my mom and dad. We spent one summer in a cabin in New Hampshire. Our neighbors were this older couple. And the old man, he used to raise chickens. He gave me my own baby chick once. It didn't mean I could take it home or anything, but I'd come over in the afternoons, and I'd play with it. One afternoon, I took my baby chick, maybe seven days old, and I walked around the farm, petting it. Then we came upon this fence... The wire fence, with little twisty ties at the top. Not so sharp that you couldn't climb over it, but sharp enough that if you fell on it, you could poke your eye out. You know when you get a scrape on your knee... And you just can't stop picking at the scab when it gets hard? You know you shouldn't. But soon you've ripped it off, and the stuff keeps coming out. And then you stop. I'll see you at 2:30. Any headache? Nausea, vomiting? A little vomiting, maybe. I have some good news to give you. You're about eight weeks pregnant. Congratulations. It certainly explains the wallpaper. Fuck, it explains a lot of things. I'm so sorry I've been on your case, babe. I had no idea! Boy, I've been coming in you long enough, I just figured you couldn't, for whatever reason. Something inside of me... Woke up. Or I hit the bullseye. We don't have to decide tonight. No, hey, I'm glad. This feels right. I mean, there's no more cigarettes, and a lot of other things, like you need to get a lot of sleep. No excuses. But... Now we'll be a real family. Hey... This is exactly what we needed. What the fuck, are you crazy? What did you do? Why did you do that, why did you do that? Why did you fucking do that? I take it back. I take it back, I take it back! I take it, fuck! No, why? Fuck! You're not crazy, you're not crazy... You're not crazy, everything's fine... Everything's fine... Maddie, come on, honey! Maddie, come on, please? Maddie, sweetie, come on, please! Hurry up! Come on, come on, come on! Angela, what's wrong? Nothing, sweetie. I'm not feeling very well. You're bleeding. Yeah. Um... I barely did anything. He never asked me, you know? You know, the first time, he didn't ask. He just went inside of me. I should have told him that I don't like pills. They don't make me feel normal. Not in any way that's real. I figured, this is what he wanted. Otherwise, why else would he would do it? Is this a secret? Yeah. Yeah, baby, this is a secret. Please, stop. So, in her confinement, she creates a new reality. I mean, she practically merges with her surroundings. So on one hand, you can argue that she goes completely insane, but in so doing, she also rises above male dominion. So in a weird way, she kind of wins, you know? Now, I want you to make this character the center of your writing exercise, and put her in whatever time and place you choose. And also, just remember, the one rule is you can't mention the actual thing that causes her to unravel. Got it? Okay, good. - Thank you. - Good work. - Thank you. - Yeah, definitely. All right man, keep it up. That was awesome, thank you very much. Thank you, yeah absolutely, you too. Hey, oh, actually, you know what? I wanted to talk to you about your writing assignment. Did I mess it up? Uh, no. No, not at all. I thought the little bit that you handed in was exceptional. Really? Absolutely. Your use of language on the sentence level was really great. You know, it uh... Was your subtext that impressed me though. You know, I felt like you were, you know, kinda speaking to a-a, you know, a-a lack of communication, or like, expression subdued. Thanks. Sure. Uh, w-what's that, uh, what's that quote by Thoreau? It's, um, "If a plant can't live according to its nature, "it dies; and so a man." I think that applies to a little bit more than writing. You know? That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. You're really good at this, Amanda. I'll see you next week. Have a nice night. How was your writing class? I liked it. What'd you guys do? We talked, and he read something, and then we did an exercise. An exercise? That's what they call it? He was nice. Who? The teacher. What college is this? Extension, I'm sure, right? No, it was, it was at his house. His house? That's not a class. Yes it is. There was wine and everything. You went to some guy's house for a class, and he gave you alcohol? What is your problem? You're not going back there. What did he say that was so nice? He was encouraging. What did he say? He said that he liked my use of language on a sentence level. What the fuck does that even mean? What other level is there? Why are you getting so upset? Where were you when he said this? Where were the other kids, where they around? I'm trying to do my homework. Another exercise, right? Yes. You're just copying down word for word what's in that book. That's... That's the exercise. You've read that book a lot of times, you know, right? I like it. Fine, see? You know what I think? I think that you are overdoing it. And now's not really the time for you to try and be, you know, Beverly Cleary or whatever. - There are no marks... - I'm trying to read. What do they suspect, poison? - Have they any idea? - Is that John Grisham? - Yeah, a real writer. - As to how she was killed. Hey, kiddo. How's it going? Fine. So, are you excited about what we told you? Yeah. Then why do you seem a little poopy-pants? Hey, what have I told you about your device and paying attention to people? Sorry, Dad. It's okay. Hey, so are you happy? You're gonna be a big sister. Can you answer me? Dad? Yeah? Is Angela sick? You mean, 'cause she's been acting strangely? Well, sometimes, when a woman has a baby in her belly, certain things happen to her body, which affect the way she thinks about stuff. It's easy for some people, but for some, it's really hard. Like, they can't do basic things, or have a logical conversation. And if you say anything, it just makes it worse, even if what you're saying makes total sense. It's like, 'cause they have two people inside of 'em. Just ignore it. Pretty soon, everything will be back to normal. All right, go to bed. Good night. Five minutes then lights out. Hi, baby. I cooked chicken. I cooked you chicken, your favorite. Hi, baby. I cooked you chicken, your favorite. Chicken, chicken. Chicken. How was your day at work today? The office manager we hired messed things up. So I've been doing it until we find a replacement. We got a few new cases, so there's a good chance that I'll be, you know, busy for the next few weeks. I'm going to Tempe tomorrow for a federal thing. It's just a day trip, so... How was your day, Maddie? We read a chapter book. What was it called? Maddie, what was it called? I asked you a question. You're scaring her. Maddie, go to your room. Now. Let me guess, you're not gonna eat? I'm not very hungry. Whatever. I'm the fuckin' bad guy. What's so important in Tempe that you're going for one day? I told you, it's for work. I might be going down there a lot though, we'll see. Okay. What is it, what's wrong? Ange? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey. You're sleepwalking, Ange, you're sleepwalking. Hey. Oh shit, I'm, I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. It's okay, shh. I had such a nightmare. It's okay, let's get you back to bed. Come on. Go back to sleep, Maddie. I can't keep doing this. It's okay, it's okay. Here. Why are you doing this again? Do you know what just happened? Angela? This is insanity. - Hey. - Hey. You ready for school? I'll take you on my way to the airport. Dad? Oh, I know, the sleepwalking thing freaks you out. It freaks me out too, but people do it. It's normal. It's just one of those things. Relax, I'll be back tonight. Did you have breakfast this morning? Your hands are all shaky. Well, go tell Angela to give you a banana. Go! You get diabetes that way. Maddie, do good listening. I am so not in the mood. Hey, Angela. Maddie didn't know if you were picking her up at school today, so she wandered over to my house and I thought I would just drop her off for you. Oh, fuck. What time is it? It's just after six. Okay. I'll be off. What did you say to Mrs. Peterson about me? Nothing. Ow! You want me to go away? You want Mrs. Peterson to be your mom? It's okay. You can tell me anything, Maddie. My mother taught me that if you want things to grow, you have to water them. You wanna go in one more time? So you can grow big and tall? I'm sorry if I scared you. I'm sorry for making you cry. There are things about being a girl that aren't a lot of fun. Soon, your body won't be yours anymore. Not in a way that you can control. You might bloom into a beautiful red rose, like so many other girls do. Or, your body might make you do bad things. And the more you try not to do them... The more you shrivel outward, and blossom into a black flower. You're wrong about my mom. She's gonna come back for me. I dreamed about it. I hope so. Who really gives a shit, Sergio? It's the end of the day, who gives a shit? This fucks the entire state, my man. Do you understand? No, Sergio, we're fucked. Ah... All right, yep. No, this is bigger than anything we've ever dealt with. And I guarantee you will not like the way it turns out. There are consequences to your... Are you insane? Wake the fuck up, Sergio! This shit is real! This shit is hot, and what the fuck are we gonna do, bro? All this guy wanted was one normal thing. Look what happened to him. You know it, and your client knows it. Just leave me alone now, please. Morning, kiddo. You sleep in your clothes last night? Dad? Jesus, what? Daddy? Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Really? Really? Please, not today. Can you take her to the bathroom, please? Now? Come on, Maddie. Let's go to the bathroom. Be very selective what you say to me, 'cause the next words out of your mouth are gonna define the rest of your life! What are we gonna do with you, Madison Burroughs? Hey, move that fuckin', move that car! Go! Lady, go! Hey. Has Maddie called you? No, why would she? She went rollerskating with the Petersons. She should have been home hours ago. I'm sure she's fine, I'll go pick her up. I called you like, six times. Hey. - Hey. - What's up? Trouble in paradise? Eh, don't ask. Are the girls out back? Where's Maddie? Sit down. She wasn't at the Petersons? No. Where'd she go, Angela? She went rollerskating with Stacy and her mom. At what time? Uh, around 11, I guess. Jeff... Who picked 'em up? Stacy and her mom. Tell me exactly what happened. Maddie was outside, and she was playing when she came in, and told me that Mrs. Peterson was here, and that you said she can go rollerskating. When would I have said that? I don't know, Jeff. You're scaring me. Well, where were you? Did you see them? - Who? - The Petersons! Stop yelling at me! I'm sorry. I was cooking, I didn't see anyone. Mrs. Peterson is not someone that I speak with on a regular basis. You know that. She comes over here often enough. I don't even go out there anymore. You asked me what happened, I'm just telling you. I heard the car, I heard little girls' voices... Jeff, what? Why would Maddie lie to me? Maddie? Maddie? Maddie? She took my daughter! You fucking hear me? She came back to my house and she took Maddie! Your daughter's full name? Madison Miranda Burroughs. And how old is she? She's nine. Any chance she could be with a relative? A grandparent? Well, my father's dead, and I don't speak to my mother, so, no. My parents both passed away. They had cancer. He doesn't care about that. Any brothers? Sisters... The person you're looking for is Margaret Laughlin Burroughs. - L-A-U-G-H-L-I-N... - Jeff. Jeff... Someone wanna help me out here? My wife disappeared three years ago. Disappeared? How? Um, she packed everything she needed, and she left. Never said a word, I haven't spoken to her since. My daughter was six years old at the time. And Margaret was possibly very likely pregnant with our second child. She said that she terminated the pregnancy, but I don't know that she did. She had a bit of a problem telling the truth. I see. Things must have been pretty bad around here for her to leave all this behind. Yeah. You think she came back for your daughter? After all these years. Yeah. And how about you? Oh, I think... I think that... She got lost somehow. And that everything is gonna be all right. Just please find her. I'll go talk to the Petersons again, make my way back here and... And go from there. Do you think she ran away because I've been such a monster? I was supposed to be watching her... I'm sorry... Please, no... Everything's okay... Now, open your eyes. And relax. Where we're going, it's beautiful. You haven't used your camera in a while. Maybe you could go take some pictures? Get out of the house for a little bit? Pictures of what? Whatever you want. Who called? Detective Mayo. What did he want? You know that class you took at that guy's house? His wife is in intensive care. There was an accident a while back. Something about razor blades and a loofah, I don't know. Oh my God. Did he want to talk to me? He said he might stop by next week. Jesus Christ. Try not to think about it. The baby just kicked. That's strange, you're not showing it. Yeah, it's like that with some women. I forget what it's called. Uh, yeah, me too. Aren't you due for a checkup? I'll make the appointment. I'm gonna be at the airport at 6:00 a.m. Please don't leave me here, Jeff. We discussed this. Three days? There's nothing I can do about it. I don't understand how you can go back to work, so soon. It's been almost two months. Barely. I said almost. I stopped hoping for something good. Babe... No. Baby... No. No, ow! Goddamn it, let go! Let go! Let, goddamn it! You're fuckin' crazy, Angela. Don't go. Go back to bed. I'm serious, stay away from me. Jeff, please. Please, please, please don't leave. Don't, please, Jeff! - Please, please don't leave... - Get the fuck off of me! God... Angela? Angela? Welcome home, baby. You're freaking me the fuck out right now. No, stay away from me. You need to go to the hospital. Will you draw me up a bath first? I want to take a bath with you. You're not taking a fucking bath. You're gonna go to the hospital, and after that, I don't know what. Were you ever even pregnant? You've been filming me. Well, you were for a while. Then you stopped. I filmed something too. Call the one. Skip past all the stuff of me sleeping. Past all your stuff. And go to the very, very end. To my stuff. The end is the best part. Jeff? I'm gonna go see about that bath. Say, "Hi, Dad." Please, please. It's my fault. I can do better. I'll be better. It'll be like it used to be. Babe, babe... No! No! Help... Help... What'd you do to her? I told her to go to the secret place. She did good listening. You... Why? Why? Three more months. Subtitles by explosiveskull
