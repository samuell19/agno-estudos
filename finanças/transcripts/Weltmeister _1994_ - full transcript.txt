Unbelievable. Okay, that'll do. … That was the latest news. And now today in detail—/i> Other people go and work for the Germans. Mopping their floors. But you? You turn your nose up.

I thought maybe he could go to Herr Reck. - No, Herr Reck is completely tied up with Johannes. - Did you see what happened to him in the yard? - And what out young man has to put up with. You know how it looked to you. And Herr Reck isn't any better. There are no places. Besides, they couldn't pay for it anyway. - She thinks your parents can’t afford the lessons. Do your parents work? - Mum doesn't work. My Dad works. Only his father works. - That's what I said. Johannes' parents don't have a phone.

You see, my ticket is for the 7th. - So, I need permission as soon as possible. - Yes, of course, but that's difficult. Look, I’m coming to the barracks for the holiday. Will you be there? - Yes. FREE JUDIT FROM 27.03.93 We now continue with a program in German from the radio station “Volga”. Good morning, beloved Volga. Do you recognise me? - What do you want? - I wanted to ask if you can give me lessons? - What do you mean? - Accordion lessons. - Good God. Wait a minute, I'll ask Dad. What's your name? - Alexei. Come in. This is him. - What's your name, my boy? - It's Alexei. He speaks German too. - Interesting. - So why did we have to learn your language? Please, sit down. - There goes that Udo again. He always has to work on his engines at the weekend. He doesn't give a shit, but we do. Last winter he used up two sacks of our wood that were in the yard. Without asking us. - This cringing attitude is typical of all of us in this family. Except me. Why didn't you complain? - Well— - Can we go down to grandma's and play? - Of course, my darling. - Sabine, whatever anyone says, you don't need to worry. It's fine. I'll drive you. - The boy's quite shy. - Leave him alone. - At least with the Russians, young people still have a bit of decency. - When the Russians are gone they'll fill the barracks with gypsies from all over Europe. We'll weep for them. - Yes. I'm not sure Mum and Dad would cry for the Russians. May i listen? - Yeah, sure. - Does he play better than you? - He's not bad. Steffi, don't touch. - My Dad says the accordion affects my performance at school. - Steffi, leave that alone. Is your father strict? I mean, because he's an officer. No, it looks that way. But he isn't. - We're going to Mum and Dad's now. - It was just you, wasn't it? - Yes. - Let's go. - Come on. Uncle Herbert has to get home. - Well, I'll ask at the company, Rosemarie. But I can't promise anything. You know what it's like these days. - Yes. Yes, this continual driving day after day is wearing me out. It's unbearable. - Oh for God's sake! In Japan, they drive 60 km to work. Even further on average. - Japan is where Japanese people live. - Think yourself lucky. I'd drive 100 km if someone'd hire me. - Come on, get a move on. Four hours on the train isn't so easy, is it. I'm really looking forward to Klingenthal. You too, Sabine? - Of course, Uncle Herbert. - Our little darling is the best. - I'm going to do some more practice. Bye. - Bye - Bye. - You'll hear from me, OK? You can stay if you want. - Thanks. But I have to go now. It's getting late. - Well, if you want lessons from me, you have to have enough time. Pay close attention. … and now we're going to tell you how the Germans usually spend their free time and holidays. Travelling is the most popular pastime for the Germans. Thanks to constantly improving well-being and reduced working hours, the Germans now enjoy more free time and longer holidays. However, it hasn't always been like this. At the beginning of the century, the majority of hired workers couldn't even dream of holidays. Many Germans spend their holidays in their own country, but most of the holidaymakers are eager to go to the warmer, southern regions. In 1990, they spent 50 billion German marks abroad. Most popular countries are Italy, Spain, Austria, France, Switzerland and the USA. - Hi. - Hi yourself. Shall we go for a walk? - All right. Why are you so sullen?

So the kid's coming every weekend now? - Have you got something against that? I'm going to get us something to drink. What did that cost? - I live off your money, but that doesn't mean you get to control me all the time. - You have nothing to do. That's why you think up stupid shit for Sabine. Where would you be without her? - That's nonsense. I have nothing else to do. Surely I'm allowed to look after the kid now and again? - This is what you call looking after, is it?

Why did you think of that? - Because everything is clean and tidy there.

How's your accordion coming along? - Dad's locked it away. - I think you wanted to—become a musician? - No, I want to be an officer like Dad. - Well, that's a good profession.

Your new address is Zabaikalskiy, Military District, Akatuy town. But if we'd lasted here another two or three months we could have earned two or three thousand marks. Then you would have got into the university. - Why didn't you say that before? - What was I supposed to do? - You didn't lift a finger for me! Others managed to adapt quickly. Everyone has a car, an apartment in Moscow— One of the officers even opened a shop! But you? You won’t even splash out on a new dress! - Silence! Sorry madame. All you do is wag your horrible tongue! Have you forgotten who provides for you? Little brat! - What’s he going on about! - I devoted my whole life to the army and got nothing in return. I don't even have a decent apartment! - Calm down!

We're leaving. - Yes I know. - I came to say goodbye. - But we'll see each other in Russia. Won't we? - Why did you tell my brother? that—I knew— he'd been sneaking into the city? - That’s part of my job. A special prayer to end the Easter matins. Sabine! What are you thinking about? What are you going to do when they catch you? - 12 against it. - Twelve? - I thought it was four. You have to help me. - What are you talking about? It's not my fault you ran away.

It's not forever. Don't you care at all where I'm going to live? Forgive me. Sabine? Will you come to visit me? - What about Dad? You're not leaving because you had a fight with him, are you? - No. And you do know I'll come and see you every weekend? Don't practise too hard. They were looking for you. So piss off out of here.

More and more private farmhouses are being built in Russia by former professional soldiers. A decision on their support was made by the Soviet government more than a year ago. The funding comes not only from the state, but also private business banks and companies. which clearly have the adaptability, creativity and ability to adapt to the requirements of the former military. Excuse me please. I've been living on the streets for four years— ever since my parents kicked me out of the house. And then I couldn't find a job. Now, I never want to hold up cars. So of course I have to buy a car first. And that's why I'm asking for a small donation. Give me a small donation. Just some loose change. Better this way. All right, let's leave it at that. You need to practise your compulsory piece a bit. One day you'll thank me for all this. Either you're the best— or you're nothing. What did you get? Where are you from? - Barracks. - Barracks? Russian barracks. - Hi Lisa. - Who's that you're hanging around with? - You can't stay here very long. - A few days maybe? - You know what? Pigs are definitely looking for you. Understand? You know, the police. Wait here. There's a guy who might be able to smuggle you in. We'll find something. For sure. Put that down! Leave it! - Lisa! - It's mine! Put it down I said! - Put it down! - Put it down! - Oh have it then! - Bastard! OK Sabine, everything's in the fridge.

Breakfast! Breakfast! Get up! Get up! Breakfast! I wear those every day. All right. Then we'll have the black velvet frock. Now. Show me. Show me? Yes. You're much steadier that way. My darling. I'll be right back. How can you gape through my window like that? What is it you really want from me? You turn up, you just stand there— and you don't even say anything! The barracks are empty. You should turn yourself in. They'll catch you sooner or later. It's too mechanical. You've played that one much better. - It's the key. We'll have that repaired right away. - What was that? Hopefully that's fixed it now. I'm sure it is.. The work is fun. That's the main thing. When you see yourself making progress— And standards gradually go higher and higher— That's what makes you happy. There's always something to do here. We strive here to get closer and closer to the highest possible standard. Sinelnikov! Sinelnikov! Stop. What are you doing? Come here at once! Where on Earth have you been? Come here I said! Now! Sinelnikov! - Leave me alone! - What the fuck are you doing? - Get out of here! Get out of here! - Sinelnikov, have you lost your mind? Stop! - Leave me alone! What's the matter? And now the last contestant for today, Sabine Lindner, Germany. What is it? I don't understand. Do you need anything? - No. Everything's in the best of order.
