BACK TO THE WALL Is anyone there? Was that you, Mr Lacourt? I wondered what was going on. - We're just back. - I didn't hear your name. Wait a second. We're not in yet. Well... Good evening, sir, ma'am. "Lacourt." They could at least shut the door. News flash. Mr Robert... Please give your name after 10 pm COMPANY JACQUES DECREY Industrial equipment What is it? - Don't worry, Julien. It's me. - Oh, it's you, Mr Decrey. It was over. The hardest part was done. I was now anxious to get back to Gloria. I needed her. It had all started over 3 months earlier. That day, I had come home from hunting 24 hours early. I was happy to see her. No. You know it's not possible. Come to Paris. That's not possible either. Come on. Be good. - I'll call you tomorrow at 11. - OK. Goodbye! It's strange. I wasn't feeling hurt, but oddly empty, a bit like when a lift goes down too fast. Are you alone? Hey! Are you alone? Huh? Yes. - It's sad, being alone. - That's true. Will you buy me a drink? If you'd like me to. A glass of champagne. Do you come here often? I think I know you... And like this idiot said, it's true, it was sad. Gloria and I had been married 8 years. I had given her everything. A rose for the lady? Hey! She's talking to you. It's 300 francs, sir. Thank you. - Thanks. You're sweet. - Listen, be nice. Leave me alone. How long had Gloria been sleeping with him? I now knew what I was feeling: a need to hurt them. I spent the night in a hotel, and from that evening onwards I was not alone anymore: I had an idea, a little idea that kept me company. Come in. - Here. - Is ma'am lunching here? Probably not. I'll tell you. Very good, ma'am. Tell Louise to prepare a cold meal for tonight for when my husband gets back. Yes, ma'am. - Hello. You're back? - Yes, Gisèle. Hello. - Is my wife in her room? - Yes, sir. Hello? - Hello, you. - You're back already? - What happened? - Berger took a bullet. - Is it bad? - No, it's in his buttock. It put a damper on things so we came home. - How are you? - Fine. - You're spending Sunday with me? - Yes. - Are you happy? - Of course. Excuse me, I have to tell Jérôme to bring my luggage in. I'll be right back. It's Sunday. The operator isn't answering. I'd like to hear from Berger. Aren't you getting dressed? No. I'm going to see Louise about lunch. Right. I'm going to get changed. Give me the line. I'll try the operator again. - Hello? - Gloria? - What number would you like? - Gambetta 24 26. Oh. There's been a mistake. This is Gambetta 24 26. Oh. Excuse me. It was already fun. And it was just getting started. "Yes, prince. "I languish and I burn for Theseus. "I love him, not one whom hell..." OK. I'm skipping a bit. "...but the loyal, "proud, even shy man." You'd have played Phaedra well. You were stupid to give up drama school. Maybe, but I wasn't you, I didn't have drive. Go on. You'll never know it. You know where drive leads you: living hand to mouth, playing piano to scrape a living. Tell me about Lajarie's project. Touring Bérénice around ski stations, believe it or not. Only Lajarie could believe in it. The other evening he was sure about it. Yes. He's always sure in bars. It's later, making it happen, that it's difficult. What's that? Leave it. I took it from a friend with dark thoughts. You're crazy. It's almost 8 pm. I have to go home. Let's finish the scene. "He shares your bearing, eyes, speech..." - No, dear. I'm late. - Does Ma'am have a dinner tonight? I have to dress up. A minister is coming. Why should I care? To think, after the drama school exam we swore to live together on love alone. Yes, but you left 15 days later. For a North African tour. I couldn't say no. A tour. And a mistress. I didn't love her. I thought... Well, I met Jacques. Let's not discuss it. Yes... The money, a great life, security... Women love security. You're doing it again. Gloria... I won't say it again, Gloria. Sorry. I can't help it. I love you. If I had money, I'd keep you. If you had money, you'd gamble, drink, but you wouldn't keep me. Come on. Be good and work on your part. "He shares your bearing, eyes, speech..." He was a real man. Thank you. My dear, the situation is completely tragic. Name a time when the situation in France wasn't tragic. Maybe the Second Empire, just before the Battle of Sedan. - It's not then. - It's just after. No better. You, one of the most dynamic industrialists... I was one of the most dynamic industrialists. I listened politely, but I didn't care. Gloria was late. Shamefully late. She'd spent the afternoon with him. One thing made me behave respectably and not scream they were annoying me: a white glint in the mailbox at the end of the garden. She didn't think to excuse her lateness. She had the letter. She was still laughing, but I knew she soon would stop. My dear minister, I'm confused by her lateness. My dear, women, you might have noticed, hate waiting. It's a torture reserved for us. You'd forgive a pretty woman like your wife anything, don't you? Yes. Almost anything. I heard the hunt at Berger's ended tragically? Well, let's not exaggerate. Some lead in his buttocks. But it's still a hunt I'll remember. The guard positioned us curiously. When I was in the hide... I was being funny. I described the hunt to make them laugh. None of them knew that I was the one killed at the hunt, but they would know, because everything comes out. I was looking for you, minister. I have no excuse for my lateness. Your ravishing dress is one to start with. She was holding up better than I'd have thought. But I who knew her well could see she was affected. The cogs were in motion. I just had to let things unfold. INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT Company Jacques Decrey - Hello. - Hello, sir. Madeleine, do we still have Berthier's passport? Yes, sir. I'd like to check when he last went to Spain. It was 2 months before he died. Wait... Can you bring me his passport? Send for Lombard. - Hello, Lombard. - Hello. I've looked at the Chatellier file. Impossible. 3.4 million for the wall? Pebbles are expensive when you pile them up. No, it sounds right. Try talking to them. I'm counting on you. Thanks, Madeleine. - Have you got 20 1,000 notes? - I'll look. - They won't change dates. - Told you. - Such a cheek! - It's the rules. The boss said that. And I said, "So it's the rules. It's idiotic. My husband works nights. I do days. "If my holidays are in September and his in October, we have no life." We don't care about your lives. Raymond said not to be mad. We're never together... - Berthier, Louis? - Yes. Nothing in that name, sir. Nothing. There was nothing. They weren't scared yet. "It would be easy to tell your husband about Mr Normand. "Since he is quick-tempered, I advise you send 200,000 F "to Louis Berthier, General delivery, Rue de l'Ouest post office. "A friend who doesn't yet wish you well." Everyone's had anonymous letters. It's someone you fired. Remember you fired a maid? - Yes, a few months ago. - It's her. It's a parting shot. Forget about it. I'm late again. Ghislaine's stopped me being fired twice already. That's it. It's there. I don't have change. You'll pay the taxi? - Goodbye, my love. - Goodbye, darling. St Lazare station. I'm late. Women are always late. She came home late. She always came home late, now. But her lateness almost pleased me. I thought they were both working at getting the money. And yet, she was relaxed that night. She was laughing. I hated her for laughing. Maybe they didn't care about my threats. I felt cheated again, I had to do better. Mauvin Agency Investigations - Mr Mauvin? - Yes. Come in. This way, sir. We'll step into my office. - Excuse me. - Go ahead. Please go in. - Sit down. - Thank you. I'm listening, sir. You can ask me anything. If it's impossible, I'll say no and forget it. It might be impossible because I'm not the right man, or because it is, well... too risky. If it's possible, there are 2 scenarios: it's easy or difficult. If it's difficult, I'm demanding. Very demanding. You see? That's clear. It's mundane. - Adultery? - Yes. I'm very perceptive. - Are you suspicious? - Much more than that. I know her lover's address and identity. Really? Half the work is done. So what do you want me for? Material proof of their affair. What do you call "material proof"? Photos leaving no doubts as to the nature of their relationship. I see. - For a divorce, of course. - No. Let's say it's for a family album. I like souvenirs. Is it possible, yes or no? Possible, of course, but difficult. How much? What did you envisage? I hadn't anticipated this. 50,000. Is that OK or not? - Well, let's say 100. - 100 it is. The rest when I have the photos. Thank you. Here is his address... and my office. I hope you'll do it quickly. Count on me. My company has a reputation for speed. Men who were cheated on for 10 years have found out in 24 hours. Excuse me. More cheating? Yes, but he's fighting back, that one. And enjoying fighting back. It's very uncommon and very interesting. Sherlock Holmes of Rue Saint Denis. I see you got money upfront. Hey, calm down. You've been spending a lot recently. By the way, Josiane. I want to ask you something. You got home late. Where were you yesterday? Ask the office, my boy. After all, it's your job. Oh! Women. Well, the other's girl will pay for it. I don't know what's up, he's no fun. I never thought he was. Today he's trying to beat his own record. Have you got the file? I'm bringing it, sir. That is obvious. Conclusion: change working hours and double the workforce. I want to meet commitments. Bergaud, where are you on the Movaco plant delivery? You saw the letter? It's not our fault. They changed the boring. We've not been delivered yet. It's your problem. The client doesn't care. - Is he here? - Yes, sir. I'll see him at once. See the other points with them. There's one about... No, Lombard, not now. Very well, sir. - Hello, sir. - Sit down. So? So, here it is. Is it what you wanted? Exactly. The quality isn't what I'd hoped for, but the conditions were... unique. Of course. I couldn't use a flash, could I? And also, with the weather... This close up is quite good... artistically speaking. Is that right? Yes. Thank you. You won't be needing me again, Mr Decrey? - No, thank you. - At your service. I had the photos. One of them in particular hurt me. It reminded me of a photo from early in our marriage. Only, it wasn't me with Gloria. That's it. Hi, Dad. Hello, my love. Well! What are you doing so early? Being early isn't your style. You're here to play for me? Are you expecting? My sister's baby. All I'll ever have. Her 5th. Give me a little whisky. "Give me", that's the word. When will you pay? When I'm a customer. I'm a friend now. I have problems. Hands off! I do heartbreak because I'm a good girl, but I can't do anything else. Léon's going to get nasty. I owe him too much, I have to placate him. Well, hold his hand and charm him. He wouldn't get it. He's hard-hearted. - But you must understand. - I understand perfectly. You're lovely but it's over for us. I need to get by. Ask your friend. She has money. Her husband does, not her. She has problems. Someone's blackmailing her. - How? - I'll tell you. Come on. Be nice. Lend me 50,000 to keep Léon at bay. What's up? Why are you here? I looked everywhere for you. Come here. Not bad! That's not bad, either. You've misunderstood Please think again See? It's worse than you thought. What can we do? There's no other way. Send the money. It's somewhat risky. If not, Jacques will find out. So? You won't have to check the time anymore. Yves, you're reckless. What are you scared of? That he'll kill you? No. Make you give up your mink coats? You want me to say it? You're scared of hurting him. Maybe. FASHION Fashion this year finally reflects changes in women's lives. That's ravishing. Don't you like it? Yes. I don't love everything, but those little jackets... Actually, Jacques, I wanted to tell you... I fancy some new stuff... Go ahead. Few husbands encourage spending. You can count them. I've never refused you anything. No. But, you see, my dear... You're going to ask for a lot. Bill my office. My secretary will pay, I won't see it. Oh, you're a love, but I'd rather you gave me cash. You go into a shop, choose, pay, take your purchases home. That's what's fun. I get it. Novelty. It's not going to cost me too much? What do you want? 100,000 F? You know, the big designer shops... 200,000? I was sure you'd want 200,000 F. It's easy being generous when you're sending yourself money. I put away my money then saw the pointlessness, the stupidity of what I was doing. She'd given in. I felt pity for her, a need to see her and take her in my arms. Miss, I'd like Gambetta 2426, please. Hello? Gambetta 2426? Someone for you. Cabin 3, sir. Thank you. Hello, Gisèle? Pass me my wife. She's at the hairdresser's? Yes, no, no. I know. Thank you. Goodbye, Gisèle. I used to pick her up from the hairdresser's, in the early days of our marriage. I soon came back to reality. I'd had a risible moment of compassion. I had to keep on. "Dear miss, "Fees relating to the photos "were omitted from the last bill. "They come to 500,000 F. "Please send the money as before. "In case of non-payment within 3 days, "your husband will be contacted "to pay the debt. "A friend starting to wish you well." Jacques... I have a confession to make. "A confession"? Yes. I know I'm going to hurt you. - Jacques... - Speak. God, speak! Don't shout, Jacques. It scares me. The bracelet you gave me for our 5th anniversary, I lost it. I was still kidding myself. For a moment, I thought she'd tell me everything. She'd actually pawned her bracelet for money. But it had a safety chain. You must not have closed it. - I went to the police. - What did they say? To go to the lost property office. For a 300,000 F bracelet? Human honesty works better with old umbrellas. It was worth so much? And she'd have been robbed by the jeweller. There's one today. A big one. Lots to read. That idiot thought I came to pick up love letters. This act was becoming more sinister. 120,000. She'd been ripped off worse than I'd thought. Selling the bracelet proved they were desperate. I had to hound them, send the money back. A masterstroke. Miss, do you have a form for a money order? - Take one, sir. - Thank you. "Here is your deposit. "I'll wait until Thursday for the whole sum owed. Finally some money! Someone sent it to you? Yes, Suzanne. I lent her some. Friends give back what you lend them now! This coffee is excellent. Hello? Mr Yves Normand? Sir, if you have some sway over your mistress, Mrs Decrey, advise her to send me what I'm owed soon. Otherwise, I will have to follow through with... with my projects. Understand? Well, your guy is extremely daring. What about the photos? That's even better. She hasn't a clue? It's not stopped. I know. How? - He phoned me. - You? Yes. He told me to put pressure on you. - It's serious. - He sent back the 120,000 F. No? He wants it all. I don't know where to get the money. If only I could help. What to do? It's horrible. If we send what he wants, it won't stop there. - You were wrong to answer. - Maybe. But now, what can we do? I was talking about it with Ghislaine. Give me a second? 500,000 F for tomorrow morning. We're in a right mess. She doesn't know where to get it. - Ask her husband. - Impossible. Why not? He has money. It's to buy his peace of mind. 500,000 to not know he's being cheated on. Please. This is serious. There might be a way. I went to the post office 3 times, there wasn't anything. That day, I was given a strangely sized red envelope. Why was there only a blank sheet of paper? Thank you. I'd like to send a telegram. - Shall I go? - No, let me. Take the wheel. - A can of oil too. - Yes, sir. Hello, Mr Louis Berthier. You must know who sent me. - Who are you? - Take it! - But... - No scene, please. I have an even crazier friend in the car behind us. - How much is it? - 3,400. Keep the change, we're in a hurry. Get going, Mr Berthier. We're looking for a quiet place to talk. Move or I'll run you over! Take the first right. We'll go to the quay. It's quiet. We'll be quick. We learned you were writing too much. It doesn't please people whose view we now share. From today, we have decided you can't write. Don't make us liars. If we have to meet again, we won't be so nice. You shouldn't laugh. We're serious. We'll get our hands on you again if you haven't understood. - Number plate? - Underlined in my address book. Now, slowly, driving licence, vehicle documents, ID. Hand them over. We don't believe you're called "Berthier". We want your address. - You really want it? - A bit. - You're called "Decrey"? - Show me. You're related to the lady? - I'm her husband. - Huh? - You're her husband? - Yes. Oh, shit. You're cheated on, you write. Shut up, Paul. You don't get it. - He looks ahead. - Put yourself in our place. Better not. You could have problems. I've not written down your number plate, I've memorized it. So I'm in charge now. - I'm going to get angry. - That's not reasonable. You have to be reasonable with reasonable people. He is reasonable. Understood, Mr Decrey. But don't push it, we could get angry. - We're listening. - How much did my wife give you? Don't add a zero. I know her price range. - 100,000 F. - Surprising, but I'll let it go. I'll give you double and you'll work for me. - OK? - Ghislaine won't like it, Mario. We'll explain. She'll have to understand. We have. OK, Mr Decrey. I'll explain what you're to do. - When does the post office close? - Don't worry. Now Ghislaine's friends are on it, we're safe. Your blackmailer will remain silent. Hello? Ghislaine, well, it's to say we hung around for nothing. 2 days. They'll think we want to rob the post office. The show's over. No, Mario. Play straight. Go back there tomorrow. I'm saying he didn't come. He's suspicious. We won't spend our lives there. Or the price goes up. Go back, we'll talk. - What's up? - No one came. They're getting fed up. And they're trying it on. It's only human. They're going back tomorrow. It won't work. He's better than us. I'm scared. I don't know why, I'm very scared. It's strange, it's like he's suspicious, like he's been warned. You didn't tell anyone? No. Only you and Yves know. Well, we'll see tomorrow. - Come on, Gloria. - I have to go home. A whisky, please. A whisky. Yes, sir. Are you, Ghislaine? I'm the guy who didn't go to the post office. - So? - Do you like playing poker? - I don't play cards. - Why? Because it's boring and I never win. What if you were sure to win... a lot? Norman is very nice, but you're not together anymore. - Why told you? - Your post office friends. - They're working for me, now. - The bastards. No. Life is hard. So what? They weren't on a crusade. You know, I don't wish him any harm. I just want him to leave my wife. - Gloria's your wife? - Yes. You see, I'm playing poker with you. - And I'm declaring. - I don't understand. Don't try to understand too much in poker. It's all intuition. If Gloria believed the bastard blackmailing her was just a friendly hustler needing money, a smart alec who'd found a way to get some... a nobody... you know what I mean, she'd be disgusted by him. I'd give a lot of money for her to be disgusted by him. All that isn't very nice. Do you prefer my wife's role? If you think I like your wife... Exactly, pull something on her. She did to you. What have you got to lose? Talk isn't everything. I'm putting myself in her place. She'd need proof. I have some. Do you have a phone token? You're ugly. You're also a cheapskate. Hello? Yes? It's no fun. Is being a cheater's wife fun? But yes, sir. It's not impossible. - Of course, I get you. - Do you get me? You're not good at following your own wife. Do something to change yourself! - Hang up. I'm talking to you! - Hello? Yes! That's wonderful. Count on me, Mr Decrey. I'll call her tomorrow morning, without fail. Ah. Finally. Are you listening now? Maybe you don't care about being cheated on. - You're boasting, angel. - How? Look at yourself. - Boor. You're all boors! - We're looking after ourselves. If you knew how much we're getting from that bastard. It's simple in something like this, I'd work for nothing. Drat, drat and drat! Yves isn't someone to be run over. If something happens, he'll be in a taxi, not under it. If he were just late, he'd have phoned. I'm scared to death. If I had died every time he'd stood me up, I'd be long dead. - Did you know him well before? - Sort of, yes. Were you his mistress? You know, questions like that, between women, always end in stupid scenes. Oh, let it go. One thing you can be sure of is that he loves you. And he's certainly never loved anyone else. He's elusive. I sometimes wonder who he could be. You're not the first to do that. If it helps, I think he, too, wonders who he is. Yves is a bird in a tree. A bird is nice, it sings, whistles, preens itself, but you're not sure where it will land. Oh, shit. I can't do these baby clothes. I'm not used to it. Is it knit 2, purl 2 for garter stitch? No. It's not. Poor kid. He'll be dressed like a fool. The aunt he has! Here, I'll finish the row. Strange things happen at Fredi's bar. The suckers in for the atmosphere in the evening would be surprised seeing us here. There. Now you can keep going. Thank you. You're kind. Some advice between women: I'd be wary of him. Why say that? I'm a terrible knitter, but I've studied men. I love looking for young talent. - Someone told me about you. - Really? Someone I trust completely. I can't remember who. - Pernicini? - No. - Meunier-Dufort? - No. - Lévy? - Which Lévy? I know several. You're right. It must be a Lévy. Whatever, if you're interested in it, you seem to be our perfect Perdican. 15 days in Brussels, maybe Liège, Gand, Namur, if we do well. Can I ask who will play Camille? It's important. - Martinella. - From the Comédie-Française? I'm counting on her. But she'll be expensive. That's why I can only pay you 8,000 F, and union fees, of course. You know, I'm an artist, not a businessman. That's my weakness and my strength. Yes, it's not much, but the role is great! Success in Brussels and you've made it, my boy. You'll see, I'm an honest businessman. If you sign now, in 3 days, 4 max, I'll give you an advance. How much? Because, just now, I have to admit that... He always needs money. And he is so weak. He's not bad, he's weak. I don't know if you've noticed. You can't not notice. That's what I loved in him. I have a sucker's taste. But not everyone is a sucker like me. What about blue ribbons? Yes. That would be pretty. What if it's a girl? Change them to pink. True. You never know quite what it is either. - What do you mean? - Nothing. What are you getting at? You know, I'm not asking you anything. You're asking me. I can't say someone went to the post office, no one did. It's strange no one went the day the Corsicans kept watch... as if the blackmailer knew he'd be caught. Who did you tell about the trap apart from Yves? - Be logical, my girl. - No. That's impossible. It's impossible. It's despicable. It's not nice, but in life, lots of things aren't nice. And other things are nice. It evens out. Don't go into details. Sometimes, he falls asleep beside me. And I look at him. He's sleeping with his nasty little smile. I don't know where he is. He's at Longchamp or Auteuil. If he's cheating, it's with a filly. You made me doubt and... I'll never know now. Never. If you don't want to know... There is a very simple way. Only you never think about practical things. Send money to the post office. The blackmailer will go back soon, when he's sure the Corsicans aren't there. Note the serial numbers. And if someone you know takes them, you might see them, in their pocket. How dare you! I was wrong to confide in you. Wrong to talk to you. - How much? - Nothing. It's for the knitting. Yes... If he calls, say I waited as long as I could. - We'll get back to it tomorrow. - Goodnight. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. Gloria? Why are you here? I was waiting for you. I was in Paris. I thought you could take me home. If you want? I've not had this unexpected pleasure in years. You needed me. What an event! - You're not sick? - No. - A bit sad, maybe? - A bit. - For no reason, of course. - For no reason. That's the saddest thing there is, being sad without reason. How do you know? I know many things you don't know about. Shall we go straight home or go to eat somewhere quiet? Whatever you want. A strange infatuation overcame me, like when I was first in love with her. Confused, she'd come to find me. She needed me, but because she was suffering for the other man. Ghislaine had done some good work. It hurt me to see her suffering, but I knew that at the end, we might be together again. - Hello? - Hello, my love. - Hello. - I'm sorry about yesterday. It's great, I've a role in On ne badine pas avec l'amour. 15 days in Brussels, then a tour, Gand, Namur, Liège, then... Gloria, are you listening? - Nothing to say? - So, you're leaving? Not for long. Time will fly by. You sound happy to leave Paris. Don't you realise what this means? - Who gave you the part? - Mauvinelli. - Who is that? - I don't know. He called me. Someone mentioned me. - Have you signed? - He'll call back. Tomorrow afternoon. It's in the bag. What's wrong, dear? Aren't you happy for me? Yes. Yes, my love. Very happy. "A down payment. The rest will follow." Don't swindle me. The Mauvin Agency never does that. I'll take you to the Deux Magots. - We're even. - Yes. This time, I don't need you. Only call if something happens. - Goodbye, Mr Mauvin. - Goodbye, sir. I won't say "until next time". Everything would soon be over. It was time. I had hurt Gloria a lot and I was exhausted. Poor love, you'll never learn how to pack. Luckily you're here. - Will you write? - Of course. - Every day? - Every day. And you'll be good? And you? I hope you trust me? I want to trust you. I have to hurry, I've not shaved yet. Tell me, my love. Can you get my passport? Where is it? Look in the desk, bottom drawer. Do you love me? Gloria, what are you doing with that revolver? Don't be an idiot! Drop it! Gloria! Gloria? Gloria, please, what happened? I cheated on you, Jacques. And I killed my lover. You killed him? He did something so horrible. It wasn't him I wanted to kill. Leave me alone, Jacques. I'm lost. She had killed him. I'd thought of everything but that. I had to follow through with my character, keep on pretending, like someone who knew nothing. And I had to find a way to save her. Where is he? His place. How did you kill him? I found his gun. He threw himself at me. Did anyone see you leave? No. There was blood in our relationship now, this crime... Gloria's crime. Her life could be over because of me. The corpse of a man who had done nothing but love her. Love her like I did, perhaps. No, it couldn't be. I had to find a way. And fast. Very fast. Several months had gone by. The investigation was over. The police thought Yves Normand had done a runner. Gloria and I had slowly returned to an almost normal life. We had decided she would not leave me. She was working with me at the factory, every day. Time was slowly healing our wounds. She must have started loving me again. Differently, undoubtedly, but the road ahead of us was clear. Yet one thing obsessed me. There, in the night, a few metres from me, was the wall. Up to now, I had not told Gloria, but it was more and more difficult to keep quiet. It was becoming an obsession. I had to talk to her, I had to share this secret, the final obstacle between us. What are you doing? Gloria... I never thought I'd tell you... but you have to know. He's there, hidden in that wall. And he'll never be found. That evening, I felt she was mine, that we were together for good. We are at your service if your wife desires any changes. It's perfect, thank you. Thank you. Here you are, sir. Thank you, Mr Decrey. Merry Christmas. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. What were you doing in Place Vendôme? We're late. What can one do in Place Vendôme on Christmas Eve? Careful, you'll break the Christmas baubles. No, come on, we won't have time to decorate our tree. Have you got the holly? Here it is. "Merry Christmas." Yeah, right! - It's another 3 am thing. - Christmas is still nice. Not for those who do the washing up. - Do you know when we're serving? - I'll ask. - Jérôme? - Sir? Help me, Jérôme. The candles aren't straight. We'll start a fire. Do you have a tree? The lady bought us one. We've not had time to decorate. But it does make things merry. Green. You're beautiful! If you mess up my hair I won't be anymore. - Where are the baubles? - In the car. - I'll finish these then get them. - No, I'll go. Be careful, my dear. Don't catch cold. Did you find them? Passport It was you. Gloria, please. Gloria, open up. You don't get it, it was for you. - Evening, Jérôme. - Ma'am. Here, Jérôme. Take this. Thank you. Merry Christmas! Isn't that what they say? We've not got the wrong day? You look strange. Hello, Hélène. Can I say hello to Gloria? Not now. In a bit if she doesn't come down. You've not been fighting again? Oh, no! Not at Christmas! Sort it out at New Year when we're not here. I'll eat oysters in peace. Tell me about it! You nearly didn't eat your oysters in peace. More and I wouldn't have come. You don't know how annoying he can be. I apologized. I won't do it again. Good. - It's not serious between you two? - She's highly strung. Watch out, Jacques. Gloria is very sensitive. That's what's always said about women. Even when they shoot us, they are sensitive. Bang! "Sorry, dear. You're not hurt?" Henri, you are absurd, as always. Not much for him, it's his 3rd. And us, forever hit in the liver, our tender spleen, are we not sensitive? Say something. Stand up for yourself, your sex. If men aren't united, they'll get us. Jérôme, tell Gisèle to send for my wife. We have guests. Gisèle has gone out. The lady sent her on an errand. Well. Excuse me. Gloria! Gloria... Jacques! Jacques! Open up! What's going on? Jacques! Open up! - Mr Decrey? - Yes. Inspector Bertin. Please come with me. - Where are we going? - Your factory. Mr Decrey? Superintendent Devral. We have a letter from Mrs Decrey that I'm going to read to you. "Yves Normand has been dead for 6 months. "His body is in the new wall of my husband's factory. "My husband is a criminal, he is to blame for everything. "Whatever his reasons, I cannot live with him, "and I am not strong enough to live without him." If, as we have cause to believe, we find Yves Normand's body, your guilt will be clear, Mr Decrey. Have you anything to say about the letter? Can you please reread the last sentence? "Whatever his reasons, "I cannot live with him, "but I am not strong enough to live without him." You'll find Yves Normand's body in the middle of the wall, about 1 m from the top. And I have nothing to say. Subtitles: Eclair Media
