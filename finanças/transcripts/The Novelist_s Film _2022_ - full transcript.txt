Jeonwonsa Film Co. THE NOVELIST'S FILM written and directed by Hong Sangsoo You won't speak now? You won't answer me? You refuse to answer? No, it's not that. When did you get so cheeky? What's gotten into you? I didn't want to burden you. My mind just went blank for a second. Seriously? That excuse again? I'm so sick of you saying that! Okay. - Can I help you with something? - I'll just smoke before going in. As you wish. - Shall I remove that signboard? - No, I'm reading it. Okay. Junhee! What are you doing here? Sit. Let me finish smoking. That girl said it was you, but I didn't believe her. How did you come? Did you know I was here? I came because you're here. Really? Who told you? Some people I know. I see. I didn't tell anyone that I'm living here. But I guess someone knew. I guess so. That's how I came. Right. Would you like something to drink? Coffee or tea? Whatever you like. Hello. Thank you. Yes, hello. I didn't greet you properly before, sorry. It's fine. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. What will you have? Coffee? Sure, if you have it. Then I'll make you coffee. She resembles someone we know. Right? - Really? - Yeah. She looks similar. Or not? But who is she? Just someone I know. She lives nearby. She helps me at the shop. - How are you doing? - Me? I'm okay. - You stopped writing? - Yes. I don't write anymore. I doubt I will again. You've gained weight. Quite a bit. I really have. 10kg, I think. You look good. You look carefree. More natural, it's nice. Thank you. None of my clothes fit anymore. I've lost all discipline. Recently I read your latest book. Sorry for not calling you afterwards. So you read it. I haven't published much recently, right? Yes, it's been a while. Tell me, why didn't you contact me? Was it hard to call me? No, why would it be hard? After leaving Seoul, I just felt sick of it all. I don't mean you. People in general. Everyone I know. But you seem to get along with people here? Well... I see you have get-togethers here? It just happened. People from nearby came, older women especially. They like it here. You seem fine, anyway. People come here to kill time. This area has no other bookstores. And I do contact a few people for lectures. I guess that's how the word got out. - I doubt it. - It's possible. I told them not to tell anyone. But how did you come here? It's so far. I came to see you. To see how you're doing. You treated me well back then. You really did. It was nothing. You want coffee? It must be ready. Okay, sure. - But did you quit smoking? - No. I don't smoke here. I'll take that. People here don't like it. - I guess so. - I smoke e-cigarettes inside! It's an interesting selection of books. I try to choose books that people will like. And I read differently now. I only read what I really like. I don't care what others think. Did you care before? Yes. There were always books. I felt I should read. But now I choose what attracts me. I just... You've discovered a joy for reading. Yes. I read things I never dream of reading before. Really? You studied theatre? Did you act? Yes. Not anymore? No, I acted a bit and then stopped. How old are you? What do you do? I'm 33. And I study sign language. You look much younger than your age. And you study sign language? Wow. Yes, I do. That must be fun. Teach me sometime. I'm still learning. Can you say this in sign language? The day is still bright, but soon it grows dark. While the day lingers, let's enjoy a nice walk. Okay. Like that. So impressive. So, what is "day"? "The day is still bright." "The day is still bright"... is like this. - Just, "The day is still bright"? - Yes. "The day is still bright." - "But soon it grows dark." - "But soon it grows dark." Like this. What's this? It means it's coming soon. "The day is still bright," "but soon it grows dark." Yes. - "While the day lingers"... - "lingers"... "While the day lingers," - "Let's enjoy a nice walk." - "Let's enjoy a nice walk." "Let's enjoy a nice walk." - Right. - You're good at this. Show me this once more. Like this? Like this. Like this. "But soon it grows dark." Wait, once more. "The day is still bright." "But soon it grows dark." "While the day lingers"... "Let's enjoy a nice walk." From now on, none of us can hear. You do it so well! It's so big. Sorry, we should go with you. But we can't leave the shop. No, it's fine. Thanks to you I'm visiting here. You say it's famous? Yes, the inside is worth seeing. Really? Maybe it will appear in one of your works. But it looks like that comic book robot. Right. Take care. Thanks for the sign language. - Yes, thank you. - Bye. Thanks for today. You came so far. Let's meet again soon. Let's do that. Bye. Will you go home by taxi? I don't take taxis. I came on the subway. - Really? - Yeah. I never knew the subway came out here. It's great. - It opened recently. - Okay, bye! - I'll in touch! - Wait... I meant to say this earlier, but I've always respected your work. It's a great honor to meet you. Thank you. - No, thank you. - Sure. I'll see you. - Okay. - Bye, then. What are you looking at so intently? - Hello. - Hi. It's been so long. It's been ages. How have you been? - Imagine meeting you here. - Yes, it's been so long. Where did we meet before? You don't recognize me? I'm Yangjoo, who lives with Director Park. Director Park... Director Park's wife! That's right. Director Park's hiding over there. I'll bring him over, okay? - Where is he? - Hiding in that corner. I guess he's hesitant to meet you. Still, wouldn't you like to see him? It seems like fate meeting you here. Yes. I'll bring him over. For a film director, he's so shy. He's just innocent, that's all. What brings you here? Here on some business? - It's been a long time. - It really has. I was visiting a friend, so I stopped by. - Oh really? - They say it's famous. It's my first time here, too. We stopped on the way back from Paldang. - Out for a drive? - Yes. I thought maybe I could use it in a film someday. I see. You're exactly the same. You look good. - Not at all. - No, it's true! You still have that charisma. What charisma? People really like that word. It's an impressive word, charisma. You really do have charisma. Truly. - I have charisma? - Ask around, everyone thinks so. - You're the one with charisma. - Me? Not at all! I don't have charisma, and you do. All right, thank you. I shouldn't have said it. So you came to meet your friend? Yes, but... Why did you hide? You hid from me? - No, I want to the restroom. - I see. Yes, it was urgent. Oh, my. - What are you writing these days? - This and that. I read your latest book. - I loved it. - So you read it. We both read it. - Thank you. - It was great, really. Shall we drink something? Is there a coffee machine? - 3rd floor, by the restroom. - Oh, perfect! Then should we go have coffee? - I'm a bit thirsty. - Shall we? - Will you drink something? - Shall we? - Where...? - The door by the elevator. - Here? - Just walk down one flight. Turn left. It's nice here, right? Wow, the Han River looks gorgeous. - It looks so nice from here. - Yeah. You can see it make a hard curve... there. Did you see his film? - It came out recently. - No, I didn't. Watch it later, if you have time. Okay. His films have changed. They feel different to me. Critics say so too, but I can sense it myself. They are really good. So clear. I'm not sure if "clear" is the right word. If that's how you see it. Wait, I should try these. But what's gotten clear? It's up to the viewer, I guess. But I do think something changed. My attitude toward filmmaking. I used to feel a kind of compulsion, but now it's much better. Really? Compulsion isn't necessarily a bad thing for someone like me, so at first I worried I'd get too relaxed, but it was okay. For sure. Before, I thought my life was shit, so I just focused on filmmaking. Life is so hard to fix, anyway. But my thinking changed. Fix life first. So, increase your satisfaction with life. Then you won't break down later. I don't know, maybe I'm just getting old. Is fixing how you live so easy? Now that you're old, you just want to be comfortable. That could be it. Right. That drive. It doesn't have the same hold on me. Since you're successful now. You must be quite rich. - Rich? - We have no money, really. Why? You're ambitious. Extremely so, I'd say. - You think so? Was I? - He's not ambitious. Everyone's just trying their best. Life isn't easy. - Right? - Yeah. Are you still angry about what happened before? No, being angry won't change anything. I wasn't wanted, that's all. Right. It wasn't me, it was their decision. I've got no power. The investor is top dog. They're the ones who turned it down. Top dog? What kind of expression is that? I really wanted to do it. I loved that book of yours. Then you should've shot it. But there was nothing I could do. No, you wanted too much. Shoot your film, make money, become famous... No, I don't want that much. Really. I only barely manage to get my films made, that's all. - What are these? - Ah, these... - Can I try them? - You have to twist them first. - Twist? Like this? - Yes. - The opposite, this way. - Like this? Turn it to focus. Wait, hold it here, and if you turn this ring, it will focus. - I can see well! - Right? - Better than that other one. - Yes. It may be small, but it's high quality. It's an expensive lens. Very bright. I don't know what he looks at with that thing. Don't know what he keeps staring at. Maybe he's looking at women's legs. What are you talking about? That's ridiculous! Here. - Why are you laughing? - It's funny. Lots of people there. It's gotten warm, right? It's spring now. Almost. I want to walk there. On a day like this, it'd be great. Yes, it's a perfect day to walk outside. It smells like spring here. Yes, you're right. We came once before, and it was nice, no people. It's relaxing to get away from Seoul. No crowds. It'd be nice to live here. That walking path we saw from above, that leads to here? I think so. It didn't branch off anywhere. Anyway, thanks for walking with me. We're happy to join Right? Right, we've just been driving. It'll be nice to walk. Great. - Shall we start, then? - Okay. What's she doing here? Isn't she an actress? You're right. She's here? - Just a minute. - You'll say hi? Of course. She's an actress, right? Funny seeing her here. Yes, that's her. - She's famous, right? - Yes, she is. She used to be. - Shall we go, too? - Shall we? Hyojin! Kilsoo! - Kilsoo, long time no see! - Yes. - You've been well? - Yes. You were out walking? You must live nearby. Yes, near here. Hello. You're a novelist, right? You recognize me? Yes, I'm a fan. Of your books. Thank you. I'm a fan of yours, too. Nice to meet you. What brings you here? Director Park drove me. I said I wanted to walk. Good choice. This park is very quiet. - Hello. - Hello. Nice to meet you. I live with Director Park. You live together? - We're married. - You're his wife. - Yes, we've lived together a while. - For how long? How long has it been? About 30 years? Around that. Including when we dated. - That's a long time. - Yes. - You know each other well? - We met for business once. But not that well, right? I didn't know you lived here. - Have you lived here long? - Not that long. You must have walked a lot. You're sweating. Yes, about an hour, walking quickly. - It's a great day for walking. - It's like spring, not cold at all. But you aren't acting? I haven't heard any news. It's been a while... No, I'm not acting. You should! Well, I shot a few independent films by some acquaintances. - But now I've stopped. - Don't you want to? I don't think so. It's such a waste. What a waste of your talent. So many directors want to cast you. Why don't you want to? You think? Why, no directors you want to work with? You must receive screenplays. You have a lot of fans. I don't know why you're hiding out like this. Everyone thinks it's such a waste, you know? - No, I don't know. - You don't? It's true! So many people are waiting for you. - What's a waste? - What? What's a waste? Do you think she's a child? You think she doesn't know anything? But we value her so much, it seems a waste. Everyone chooses the life they want. You think she's a child? If she chose her path, and she's happy, we should respect that. A waste? You know what that word implies? It means she's doing something wrong, or living the wrong way. How can you say that to a grown person? She's not in elementary school. Do you love her life more than she does? Or do you know more about life? Are you wiser? - You don't know your place! - So that's how you feel. Everyone wants to realize their life in their own way. Not everyone cares about money. You should acknowledge that. A waste? Just try not to waste your own lives. It's a waste because we value her. She's still young. She's young, but she's not using her talent. But what is she wasting, exactly? Should she keep shooting big commercial films to not waste her life? Would that satisfy you? Life is so short, you shouldn't miss your chance. Everyone has their time. You know that old saying, don't waste your chance. So that word just popped out. Don't waste your breath. Waste your breath... Waste... Honey, I think we'd better go. - Really? - Yes. - No walk? - Next time. Do you want a lift, or will you walk here? I think it's better if you just go. Thank you. - We'll be going then. - Yes, goodbye. See you later. It was great to see you! - See you again. - Yes, goodbye! I'm sorry for shouting. - Okay. - Okay! I'm sorry for shouting. No, you really shut him up. You've got great charisma. Really? Yes, you took the words right out of his mouth. You have charisma. - I have charisma? - Yes, you do. If you say so. By any chance... Can you smell anything on me? No, do you smell something? I walked so quickly, I feel hot. I sweated a lot. This jacket is hot. I need to walk, too. I never have time. Really? My husband, too. - Hello! - I tend to walk quickly. Here you are. Why are you so late? I slept late, must've been tired. I laid down for a quick nap but couldn't wake up. You're always late. This is the novelist Kim Junhee. You know her? Of course. Hello. Nice to meet you. - I read your novel. - Really? Thank you. My husband's nephew. His name's Gyeongwoo. I see. So you come here often? Yes, I do. It takes about an hour. Walking really quickly makes me feel great. I like walking fast. - With your husband? - Not usually. He doesn't like exercise. But his work itself is a kind of exercise. - Doing artwork. - Right, he does pottery. - You knew that? - Sure. I read about the two of you in an interview a few years ago. It made me a fan of both of you. Thank you. So you live nearby? We used to live in Yangsuri, but we moved here two years ago. The maintenance fees were too high. Maintaining a house is really expensive. And it's cold. I get cold easily, and it took so much oil to keep it warm. - Heating oil? - Yes. - But today it's so warm. - Yes, it's really like spring. He's majoring in film. - What's your school again? - KNUA. The Korea National University of Arts. - Really? That's great! - Yes. You want to make films? Yes, I'm studying hard. Then let's talk about cinema. I'm really interested in film. - Really? - Sure, let's talk film. I'm still just a student. He's really smart! Despite his looks. Don't embarrass me. And he thinks of his uncle as a total hero. Right? Yes, that's right. - Your name's Gyeongwoo? - Yes. Did you walk here, too? I was late, so I drove. That's why you're not sweaty at all. Then you know how to use a camera? Yes, sometimes I shoot my own work. I know the basics. - For the camera? - Yes, the camera. I'd better wash up. Let's go together. I need the restroom. Really? Great. It's that way. - You okay? - Yeah. You waited long? We were talking inside, so it took a while. That's fine. She wants to shoot a short film with us. Really? She wants you to do camera and editing, and your uncle and I to act in it. Really? With Uncle? A short film? I've always wanted to shoot a film. A lifetime dream, I guess? Meeting my favorite actress, the thought struck me. Of course, she has to agree. But if you can spare a day or two, I'd like to shoot something short. I'm really curious what kind of film a novelist would make. Right, me too. You thought of it today after meeting Kilsoo? Yes, I'm such a fan of hers. To be honest, I don't usually get interested in actors. But that's a precondition for this project. It has to be someone I really like. Thanks for your kind words. No, I really mean it. I know. Thank you. You're really great. - Its so nice to meet, right? - Yes, it is. - I'm jealous. - Really? Two such great artists, meeting and appreciating each other. Thank you. Thank you, Gyeongwoo. You two are comfortable together, right? Of course, you'd have to be interested, but I think you can shoot it. Just casually, up close, with a digital camera. That would be perfect. Yes, I see. All of the elements have to converge. - I thought that from the start. - Really? Most important is an actor I can freely look at, observe, and feel with my heart, and she's put in her most comfortable state. Then the camera... will capture whatever emerges from her at that time. I want to record that just as it is. So the person this actor meets in the film has to be someone she connects with, who she feels a deep emotion for. All the feelings, glances, and gestures between I want to capture that with the camera. So everything has to be comfortable, everything has to be real. So that's your idea. Yes, this is the idea I've carried with me. So it's similar to a documentary, right? No, it's not that. What I want to shoot isn't a documentary. My film will have a story. I'll write it, of course. But that story won't prevent the real things emerging from the situation I set up. It might be a simple story, but I'll make one. Whatever it turns out to be, it won't be a documentary. I see what you mean. But what do you think, Gyeongwoo? Can you do it? I'm not a filmmaker, but I really want to try this just once. It sounds good to me. I'm curious about what you'll make. And if my uncle and aunt take part, of course I'll want to help. What do you think? As for me... - It's only a day or two? - Yes. Since I love your work so much, appearing in your first ever film... Anyway, it should be interesting. Thank you, I'm so encouraged! No, it should be fun. What about your husband? Will he do it? It'd be great if he would. I don't know. I can't say now. I'll have to ask him. Of course. Since he's an artist too, perhaps... Of course. - People are eating there. - Right. Is that allowed? Sure, snacks should be okay. It's a park, after all. We should let them, then. Then let's bring something next time. I can smell it. Tteokbokki and kimbap. You can smell that? Your sense of smell is amazing. Yes. I can smell well. Like a blodbound! Really? Her eyes, too. Like a hawk. No, my nose is more sensitive. It smells really good! I'm amazed. I can't smell a thing! - Really? - Are you hungry? Yes, I am. I didn't eat lunch. - You must be starving, then. - I want some ramen. No, bibimbap. That's what I want. I'd like ramen. Whenever I think of ramen, I want to eat a bowl. - I could eat two bowls right now. - Really? - Shall we go, then? - Sure. But isn't this path nice? It'd be good to shoot here. - It's really pretty. - It is. But don't get your hopes up. I still need to ask my husband. Of course. Thanks so much. - Thanks for driving us. - No problem. - Get some food there! - Sure, enjoy your meal! It was so nice to meet you. - I'm a real fan, you know? - Thanks. See you next time. Don't be late. Bye. Want some tteokbokki after this? I'll eat this first. It's flour-based, is that okay? I like flour tteokbokki better. Me too. You must be feeling some doubt. What does a novelist know about film? No, on the contrary, I'm intrigued! I'm glad. - There's a school playground. - Yes. Seems like a good day for drinking. - You feel like drinking? - A bit. Do you drink alcohol? I like to. But I've stopped. I like makkeolli a lot. Wine, too. I like makkeolli, too. But why don't you drink these days? - I've been dealing with some things. - I see. But why make a film? Was it a dream of yours? I've written many novels. Very many. Yes. But these days I can't write. It's been a while. I didn't know. I guess I've lost the strength to write. Really? Of course, I can force myself. I've done it all my life. And something new might come out of it. Sure. You can't find the energy? No, it's not that. How can I explain? It didn't used to be so... and writing was fun. But now, my writing feels exaggerated. I can feel myself exaggerating. - Really. - Yes. Like I have to keep inflating small things into something meaningful. And I have to pretend I'm the kind of person who always felt those things. That's a big burden. And frankly, it's embarrassing. I see. Years ago, that sensitivity of mine seemed interesting. A kind of privilege, even. And I believed in everything I felt, so it was okay. But I don't feel that way anymore. I've never been a writer with a strong narrative style. Part of me would like to try it, but I don't feel up to it. And even if I did, I doubt it'd be very interesting. But if I continue on with my usual approach, it all feels exaggerated. Still, I've kept writing each day. Since I'm a writer. But then I just stopped. We'll see what happens. You really should rest. For me, it helps a lot. Thank you so much, Kilsoo. You seem so honest. I feel like drinking, too. - Some days you need to drink. - It's true. Look at her. - She was staring at you. - Why would she? Yes, she really was staring at you. Really? So cute. - Because you're so pretty. - Really? What a cute kid. - Just a minute. - Yes. - I should make a call. - Go ahead. Kilsoo? - Did something happen? I'm close by. - What a relief. If you don't mind, could you come over? Two people who planned to come can't make it. So it'll just be the poet with me and Hyunwoo. I feel sorry to him. I see what you mean. But weren't they the ones who invited him? That's right. It's a bit awkward... He'll arrive in 30 minutes. I'd appreciate it if you'd come. Can you? Okay. I'm nearby, so I can at least stop in. But it will be 30 minutes before I can go. Okay, that's fine. Want me to bring tteokbokki? I'm at Strawberry's. Are you there now? That would be great. We'll be drinking makkeolli, so that should go well with it. - Can you buy two portions? - Okay, I will. Thank you. - It's nothing. - Okay. Someone I know needs me for something. I'm really sorry, but I'll have to go after eating. - I'm so sorry. - Not at all. We can meet again. - I'm so happy I met you. - Me, too. Or do you want to join us? I'm sure it'd be okay. - Who is it? - I met her after moving here. She's so friendly. She's older than me. - I really rely on her. - I see. She seems very educated, very sensitive. I like her. Should I join you, then? I just like spending time with you. Great. Shall we drink? They're having makkeolli there. - Sounds wonderful! - Yes. - Is it far from here? - No, it's nearby. - 5 minutes away. - Really? - Then should we finish eating? - Sure, we have time. - She's back. - There she is. No need to finish. I'll bring tteokbokki. - Ma'am? - Yes? Can I have 3 portions of tteokbokki? - Tteokbokki? - Yes, not too spicy. Okay. - Just a minute. - Sure. - It's here? - Yes. This bookstore? The woman you mentioned is the owner? Yes. I see. Actually, I know her. I met her today, before meeting you. Really? She's my younger colleague. We met often when she was in Seoul. - I can't believe it. - Quite a coincidence. Will it be okay to go in again? It's fine. We'll just tell her what happened. Right. - Shall we go in? - Yes. Hi! - Drink your fill. - Yes, thank you! She already drank a lot. I've seen your films. You were really great. Thank you! Want some more? - Did you two know each other? - No, we just met today. Really? I thought you knew each other well. We may shoot a film together. - Right? - Yes. - A film? - A film? She wants to shoot a short film, with me. I still need to get her confirmation. - It's really true. - We agreed! Really? What kind of film? I don't know. Ask her yourself. But you two just met in the tower. - No, the park. - Right, the park. That park where I walk. We met there. It's amazing. Today's been one of those days. A really strange day. Meeting all these people I know. - How long has it been? - It's been ages. - 10 years since I saw you last. - More, I think. You're right. Has it been that long? I didn't know you two knew each other. Of course we do. - I guess so. - We were drinking buddies. - We drank so much, right? - We really did. Right. - Would you like some? - Yes, thank you. I couldn't say this before, but it's a huge honor to be sitting before you. Don't be silly. It's true. I have all your poetry books, every one. Really? Thank you. That's pretty rare. Not at all. I'm so honored... - Can I pour you a drink? - Yes, sure. - Would you like some? - No, I'm okay. You still have some left. - Would you like some more? - Me? Sure! It tastes great today. - Doesn't it? - It's been ages. You know. You haven't published anything recently, have you? - Delicious, right? - Yes, it is. Me? - Because I can't write. - You can't? Why not? Well, maybe I'm all done. - You're all done? - Really. Why do you think? Who knows? You can never know that kind of thing. - I don't know! - I don't know! Still, don't give up. You have talent. Me? - I'll try. What about you? - I'm the same. If I drink, I can write. Drink some more, write some more. You have your alcohol. - It's my blessing! - Right. You can drink too. You don't drink these days? No, I want to live long. Why live long? What's the point? Well, my doctors say I should stop drinking. - Doctors? - They say to be careful. Doctors always say that. - All the time. - Right. But you have so much talent. - You're blessed! - Me? And you'll shoot a film with me soon. - Right? - Yes. Were you two always so close? I told you. We were drinking buddies. I never imagined you two were close. How could you? We never told you. Right. You don't need to know all that. Okay. You're so impressive. - I'm so glad I met you today. - Me too. You are even more impressive. Thank you! Can we really make a film? Of course. Let's do it for sure. Sir, you're an impressive man too. Thank you. - Have another drink. - Thank you! This is so nice. People need to drink once in a while. - Right? - Yes. I'm really so happy that I met you. Me too, really! I'm happy, too! Another drink! Another drink? I'll get a bottle. Wait, we're all out. It's okay to drink. What do doctors know? Right. It was so nice when we drank together. That was long ago. - You were really cool then. - Really? But you've gotten old. Of course, soon I'll be 70! Really? I guess so. How old are you now? Why ask that? No need to tell everyone. Really? Ms. Kim, about our film... What is the story? Don't call me Ms. Kim. Just call me Junhee. Right. Junhee! That's a bit much. I haven't decided the story yet. If your husband agrees, then I'll think of one. Why? Then I'll be able to write. Like I said in the park. I can write after choosing the people. - Really? - Yes. - I see. - Yes. Seeing you right now, I just thought of a story. You did? - It came to me right now. - Really? What's the story? No, don't. Don't say anything. This is mine. Don't. Okay. Don't spoil it. Just don't say anything, okay? - You always spoil things. - Okay then. - She doesn't want me to say. - What is it? No, Kilsoo. If your husband agrees, I'll write the story. But the story isn't so important. - Really? - Yes. The story's not that important. A birthday, for example. We could make a story out of that. It's your birthday, but your husband forgot. So you quarrel, and then you get really angry. So you leave for your mother's house. Then your husband arrives there, as if nothing had happened. So he takes you two out to a restaurant, and go walk in the park to cheer you up. Even this kind of story can be used. - Sounds interesting! - Really? I like that story. Because that really happened to us. What kind of story is that? And then what? That's it, for now. Isn't it too offhand? Don't you need something to pull people in? I'll do that later. I like it! Because it really happened. - Really? - Yes, it was exactly the same! So I really like it. That's great! No, a story needs plot. That's what we expect from a storyteller. Another drink? Sure, thanks. Kilsoo drank so much. How will she get home? She'll wake up soon. She always sleeps while drunk. It won't take long. She'll wake up in an hour. That's why she said she doesn't drink. She and her husband agreed not to. Why? Because it's not good for her. Though she likes it. Should we call her husband? I did already. I said she was with me. But were you and the poet really close? We used to spend a lot of time together. He's lost his fire. Used to be scary to see him drink. - Really? - Yes. He drinks a lot now, too. No, he was scary back then. He's gotten old. Did anything happen between you two? What could happen? - Really? - Why? Does it look that way? I've never seen hima yield to anyone. It's surprising. We slept together once after drinking, that's all. I see. But he kept calling me afterwards. It began to get tiring. So I got drunk and told him off. To snap him out of it. After that we didn't meet often. It got uncomfortable. Shouldn't sleep with men recklessly. Especially sensitive types like him. Yes, he is sensitive. I walked too much, I'm tired. Right. We drank so much. We did. Too much. I used to go with him everywhere. - Did you? - Yes. He writes what he lives. Such writers are rare. Right. Don't go tell anyone. I don't even meet anyone. Don't worry. For his sake, at least. Okay. Have some more. Thanks. What story did you think of before? What do you mean? You said you thought of a story for Kilsoo. Did I say that? Right. I can't remember. Really? I forget those things right away. It's like smoke. Too bad you didn't write it down. That happens often. If you don't write it down, you forget. - Some more? - Sure, just a minute. You're so healthy. Thank you. She sleeps anywhere, doesn't she? She always does that. But she'll wake up soon. I see. Life as an actress... She seems pure-hearted. It's true. She really is. That's good. You look pure-hearted, too. No. No? Thank you. - Hello. - Hi! - Hello. - Hello, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Ms. Kim is waiting inside. Really? We arrived early. This is programmer Shim Jaewon. Hello. - My friend. - Really? - Thanks for coming. - Thank you. You came early? Yes, around 8:00. We've already had one screening. For film critics. I see. Yes, two people came. - Two people? - Yes. - Shall we go in? - Yes. This way. You can sit here. - Thank you. Sit down. - Yes. - Is this okay, in the front? - Yes. Should I watch myself? Will you watch it? Do you want me to? - You've seen it? - I'll be outside. Okay. - Gyeongwoo, will you watch? - No, I'll stay outside too. If you're thirsty... - No, I'm fine. - Really? This theater is really nice. Yes, it is. I'm happy to watch it in a place like this. Today was my first time seeing it on a big screen. - It's nice. - Yes. I'm happy to show it to you on this big screen. - I'm excited. - Yes. - Congratulations. - Thank you. To you, too. - I look forward to it. - Yes. I'm really curious to hear what you think. Me too. Really. - Enjoy the movie. - Yes. - Can we start right away? - Yes, we'll start now. See you. - It started now. - Thank you. It's nothing. She came alone. I thought they'd come together. Her husband said something came up. - A visitor from abroad. - I see. - Too bad he couldn't come. - You're right. What time will the film end? - We have until noon? - Yes, until noon is fine. It's 47 minutes long, so it'll finish at 11:16. - 11:16? - Yes. 11:16... 11:16... I'll set my alarm for 5 minutes before. No need, I'll be watching. No, what if Kilsoo comes out and we're not here? Right. Want to see the rooftop? It's really nice. Oh really? Shall we go? It's great. - Shall we, then? - Yes, this way. I'll look around as we wait. I love rooftops. They set it up really well here. - Really? - Yes. - You like it? - Yes, it's great. It's really well done. - They worked hard on it. - Yes. Can I smoke over there? Smoke? It's a non-smoking area. It's an e-cigarette. An e-cigarette? Yes, I really need a smoke now. Then can you smoke over there? - An employee might come up. - Of course. - Thank you. - Sure. She must want to smoke now that the film's playing. Sure. But she smokes a lot in general. I wanted to see it, too. - You should've seen it this morning. - No. If someone comes, I need to be outside. Thanks anyway, for letting us screen it. It was the manager's decision, not mine. Thanks anyways. How is the film? Your thoughts? Watch it later It's a bit unusual. - You might like it. - Really? It might be your kind of film. - If it suits you, it's great. - I'll need to watch it. Watch it for sure. And working on it? How was that? What's it like working with a novelist? She's passionate, to a surprising degree. - Really? - Yes. And her ideas are very clearly thought out. She knows exactly what she's thinking. - Really? - I should learn from her. And while editing, we watched it... at least 300 times? Seriously, from beginning to end. - Really? - Yeah. - That's amazing. - A bit excessive? She's much more meticulous than the film students I know. I was really surprised. Wow. Must have been hard. Well, a bit. Isn't this pretty? So pretty. Here comes the bride. - Here's another fallen leaf. - Pretty color, right? This one too? No, it's prettier with just two. - Like this? - In the back. It's pretty with this one, too. This won't fit in. - It's so pretty. - Yes. - Are you shooting in color? - No. - Black and white? - Yes. What a shame. It's so pretty. We can shoot in color. Look how big it is. But it's prettier with just two. So nice. - I love you. - I love you. production manager Kim Minhee sound Seo Jihoon production, screenplay, direction, cinematography, editing, music Hong Sangsoo poster Song Eanmi, Leem Jeonghye english translation Darcy Paquet production Jeonwonsa Film Co.

You can take this elevator. - Thank you. - Sure. Where did she go? I'm sure she's up there. I have work in here, but go on up. - Thank you. - Yes.
