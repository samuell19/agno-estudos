[Venky]: Hi, my dear friends! I am your Venky speaking. Well the thing is... We'd generally assume that planetary movements, constellations, days of week, nature of timings, money, fate etc control our lives. If we don't live properly, the minute things which we ignore will bring doom to us. Didn't get it yet? Come on to the earth, guys. See that? The note that is supposed to be in a pocket, the fruit that is supposed to be on the tree, and the nail that is supposed to be on a wall... These three items have brought doom to three bigwigs. The common point here is that the one who spelt doom in the lives of these three people is the same cop. Come on, let's watch it. [thunder rumbles] TIHAR JAIL, NEW DELHI -We have permission. -What sort of permission? We have a permission letter of the Central Home Minister. The person who we are going to interview now is not an ordinary person. He is the most wanted criminal who terrorised India at one point of time. He got acquainted with anti-social elements when he was ten. He got a special position in Mumbai Mafia world at the age of 25. He was involved in the serial bomb blasts that took place in Mumbai 15 years ago. After that, he got caught by the police in the most unexpected manner. He is none other than the most wanted criminal Saleem Bhatkal. Shall we start the interview? If you want me to speak, I need to be paid. One minute. [phone rings] Sir, there is a twist in the programme. Saleem Bhatkal is asking for money. I worked very hard to get the permission. We have finalised the telecast time as well. It is very important to us. Finish the deal at any cost. Yes, sir. [sighs] How much amount are you expecting? -Five lakhs? -Uhuh. Fifty lakhs? Uhuh. Five crores? Fifty rupees. Fifty rupees! Fifty rupees! Fifty rupees? One minute. Do you have fifty rupees? I don't, madam. Madam... I, who used to rule Mumbai from Dubai with a single phone call, am now sitting in this jail incapable of doing anything. And the reason is this fifty rupees. This freaking fifty rupees! Intelligence agencies have received information that the international rogue and the Mumbai bomb blasts accused who has been absconding for three years Saleem Bhatkal, has entered India. The Mumbai police have started search operations to nab him. OUTSKIRTS OF KURNOOL CITY, 5 AM. Thank you. -Greetings, boss. -Greetings. Greetings. I am Mastan... Manipulate Mastan. We received a phone call about your arrival from Mumbai. I will handle every task that you need in Kurnool. Please come, boss. Come. Take some rest. All the food arrangements will be made. We issued a red alert against Saleem Bhatkal at all the airports including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore. His passport has also been seized. He will not be able to get out of the country. All his exit points have been sealed. Arrange new passports for me and my wife. Arrange them immediately. Okay. As-salamu alaykum, Jayaram, sir. Waalaykumu s-salam! You have already obtained 20 passports on this address. The officer inside is newly appointed. He is very strict. Here, change the address. Bring the documents with a new address. Damn! Come, sir. This is the house I mentioned about. Have you told him about all our conditions? As if this is an auction to tell that every time. The rent is 5000 rupees with a six months advance. And there is an addition of 50 rupees on electricity bill from this month. Why the additional 50 rupees? You come up with some catch every time I'm here with a party? He can take it if it's fine, else quit! Hey, it's a matter of my reputation. Huh? A mere broker talking about reputation? Please stop. Hey, how dare you insult me! -Hey, how dare you lay hand on me! -Hey Mastan, what's that mess. Leave that. -How dare you call me a broker! -Why are going overboard? I will kill you! -Hey, you... -You... Get lost To hell with his house! His house is unworthy. The house in front of us is having a better Vastu than this. Come, I'll get that for you. What is the bloody fuss for just fifty rupees? Let's go. I am giving the house to you. You can do house warming tomorrow. Okay. 8-2-167. Yes, now the address is perfect. You have been searching for four days for Saleem Bhatkal. Do you think he is still in India? There is no chance for him to cross the border. Saleem Bhatkal can't escape the police this time. No matter how big the criminal is, he is bound to commit some petty mistake. And there would be a diligent police officer who would trace that mistake. [motorcycle thumping] Mother... Faster... [motorcycle revvs] May your husband be promoted as a circle inspector! Drive slowly. The lids are opening up! Go slow... Slow. Drive faster, mom! Hey kiddo... listen to me please! What's with you, darling? Please tell him. Faster... Faster... Whenever there is a festival, she'd make me and the kid wear the same color, make me carry boxes, -and get us to the temple. -Yes, dad. -As if this is an orchestral band-- -Huh? Dad says that mom! You shouldn't speak like that at the temple. That's a sin! Put those boxes down and seek forgiveness. Ah! It's the same menu, Acharya. It's the same Pulihora (lemon rice). I think you have added more cashew nuts and raisins this time. You make super tasty dishes, madam. Dad, a little down. What, kiddo? It was you who got up at 4 am and made Pulihora (lemon rice), didn't you? But why are they giving all credit to mom? Hey, don't be loud. She might feel bad if she overhears. I too would get hurt if you were made to look weak in public, dad. -Huh? -Well its nothing. Well... dad's feeling bad. Hmm. -Let's go. -Come, ma'am. You fox! You have become an ace in changing your words as per the situation. You support mom at home and here, you are supporting me. Trickster! You would become a great politician. No, dad. I would become only a cap. I know, you little rascal. Let's go! Daddy, you gave me a uniform to wear, one town police station to do my duty, a beautiful wife and a kid who cracks satires at me. This is enough for this life, daddy. This is enough. Farewell. See you soon. See you. Okay. No passport enquiry came. -Are you sure? -Yes. Check this. This is the second lane of Sulemanpeta, right? So what? The area on this side of the road falls under two town police station limits and the other side falls under one town station limits. Don't you know? -One town? -Yes. [mobile rings] -Sir. -Yes, tell me. There's been a small mistake, sir. The house which we took for rent falls under one town police limits. So what? We have our men at the two town police station. All our passports get managed in that station. But now, someone from One Town station would come for enquiry. Well it's a cop there too? Manage it somehow. Okay, sir. What was the bloody fuss for just fifty rupees? Good morning. Are you bidding farewell or doing a salute? Come on, sir. We don't need these formalities between us. Hey! I've been doing the police job to get salutes, but not for the sake of salary. Okay, sir. That's it! My salute is to you and your salary is for me, sir. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Good morning, sir. -Subba Rao... -Yes, sir. -Where is Mr. Raju? -He didn't come yet, sir. Didn't turn up yet? How come he didn't come yet? Generally, he would have been here by this time. Yes... Welcome, Mr. Raju. The station loses it's charisma without you. How can you be late, Mr. Raju? Trying to get habituated to my home, sir. Because I have to be at home from tomorrow, sir. I am about to retire, sir. For 33 years... My living got accustomed to complaints, reporting, enquiries and transfers, sir. My wife and children too would seem to me like pending cases. Without the uniform, I feel I am in a disguise. And it will be like that till my death. A strange feeling of being pushed out from my house, sir. Mr. Raju, come. Sit... please sit. Mr. Raju. Retirement means a paid rest. Once a cop, always a cop till death. This is your station. You can come here anytime you want. Share your 33 years of experience with us and be our support, Mr. Raju. We'd feel very happy. Okay? Mom... What's the matter, Chinku? Mom... What's the matter, dear? What, dear? Want to drink Boost? No. -Horlicks then? -No. Then, what do you want? I slept between both of you last night. But how come I woke up in the hall, in the morning? Ask your father. [takes deep breath] Hmm... -Dad... -Yes, dear. -Dad! -Don't scare me. Er... well, it's called somnambulism. Somnambulism? What does it mean? Sleepwalking, son! -Eh? -Yeah! Well, you indeed, slept between us. But you've sleepwalked to here and slept. I won't believe you. You have to believe me. That's our hereditary disease. It has passed from my grandfather to my father. And from my father, it passed to me, and from me, it got passed to you. And you'd pass somnambulism to your kid as well, you young devil! -Is it? -Yes, dear. Yeah, your smiles! Well, I woke up in the hall. But where did you wake up? Whoa! Son of a cop! Too many doubts. -Get ready. It's time to go to school -Stop it! Dad, behave yourself. Whoa! Come on! Make it fast! Hey Cheeku, come here. Where did you meet him, mom? He's been passing his diseases to me. Do you know how your father came into my life? How? -Shankar... -Yes. -Shankar... -What is it? We should be generally having a whisky. But what's with these Yoga asanas? Mental fitness is a must along with physical fitness, for police training and Yoga is very much needed for that. Come, guys. Hmm... -Who's this rum bottle-looking guy? -Looking fresh? What did you see to tell that? How did you know? Because you have come to do Yoga wearing Lungis. Do you mean we shouldn't do Yoga wearing Lungis? Of course, you can, but it'd be unbearable for others to watch you. Are you well versed with the postures? We know about the addictions, but not the postures. -For brats like you... -Hey... For beginners like you, there is a class over there. Join them. Pleasurable nights and morning Yoga in whites. Lucky chaps! As if we don't! Let's not get into this. Let's do our own Asanas. Ramana, try that posture. Mahesh, you try this posture. Hey, you try that. Okay. Nice. Hello, jingle... Hey! Not her! The posture behind! -Oh this? -Watch it carefully. I... He seems good. I will try this posture. He is confident. He's asking me to do this posture. This girl has raised her legs up and I am in a lungi. What if someone watches? Who cares? It's their problem. Ow! Wow! Look at him. I don't think even Baba Ramdev would've made a Yoga posture for so long like this in a disciplined manner. He is a genius. [groans] Your pose is outstanding! It is not outstanding. I got stuck! Got stuck? This is foolishness. -Hey, he got stuck. Come here, quick. -Got stuck? -Slowly. Careful. -One shouldn't go overboard! -Hey... Hey... -Come and check him. -Stop... Stop... -[groans] If you release it in an improper manner, the main organ would get damaged. -You mean... -Yeah, that of course. -Oh man! -Isn't there someone who can rescue him? This is awareness. She is the solution. She is the epitome of Yoga. What happened? He got excited and went too far! Hmm. Okay. -What will you do, ma'am? -Sir, please... [groans] Thank God! You shouldn't try things directly. You've got to take it step by step. Okay? I will start from tomorrow. Oh! Tomorrow? -Yeah. -Okay. "Hey beautiful damsel, I've fallen in love for the first time" "Shall we start dating and go around the parks in the city?" "Her looks and attire blow my mind!" "Her sheer dress sense makes me go bonkers!" "Her kindness and tender beauty blow my mind away" "Her style makes me go crazy!" "You've amazingly come into my life, sweetie!" "You've amazingly come into my life, sweetie!" "You've amazingly come into my life, sweetie!" "You've amazingly come into my life, sweetie!" "Her looks and attire blow my mind!" "Her sheer dress sense makes me go bonkers!" "I love it!" "Hey beautiful damsel, I've fallen in love for the first time" "Shall we start dating and go around the parks in the city?" "I've stopped eating..." "I've stopped eating, lost in your thoughts" "I've been looking at you stealthily in my dreams" "I've been following you for miles" "I've been with you forgetting myself" "since the day I met you!" "You've amazingly come into my life, sweetie!" "You've amazingly come into my life, sweetie!" "You've amazingly come into my life, sweetie!" "You've amazingly come into my life, sweetie!" I have unlocked your father in that manner, and he has locked me up with him with love. Is it, mom? Hey kiddo, it is getting late. If you are done with your mother-son stories, we'll make a move. Yeah, I know. What do you know? How come you took advantage of her innocence and make her fall for you? I am the one who is innocent, not your mom. The bus is waiting. Come on, start. [bus honking] Mwah! Bye! -Mwah. Mwah. Bye. -Bye. Bye. Bye, darling. Subba Rao, what happened? The scooter doesn't start. Headed to the station? There is a passport enquiry at Sulemanpeta, sir. It is on the way. Let's finish the task en-route. -Okay, sir. -Umm. Here is house no. 8-2-167. This is Satyanarayana's house. Oh! Okay. -Well... finish your task and come. -Okay, sir. I am here for Passport enquiry. Okay. Come in, sir. Please sit. -Are you Mr. Satyanarayana? -Yes, sir. What about Mrs. Annapoorna? Annapoorna... Here, she is. -Greetings, sir. -Greetings. [mobile rings] How come you called so soon, darling? Missing me? Yes. [Telugu song playing on radio] Darling, do you have white saree with black lining? Yes, I have it. You have it! Do something. Get it ready for tonight... What do you say? Okay. Oh! -Sorry lady. I didn't notice. -Give me one. Mwah! Mwah! Bye. Hey Subba Rao, are you done? Yeah, coming, sir. -Shall we go? -Yes, sir. How dare you to sell black tickets that too for Shakeela's movie? -Sir. -We didn't even watch it till now. Selling black tickets eh? Come on, hit them. Men attend the screening of Shakeela's movies without their wives' knowledge. And you've done an injustice to them by inflating the ticket price. Bash them, Mr. Ramesh. Burqa? With a face that resembles a burqa, you sell black tickets in burkhas! If I ever see you in a burqa, I will kill you. How dare you sell black tickets? [groans] Subba Rao. Sir... What is the name of the person in your passport enquiry? Satyanarayana, sir. Then, how come a burqa was taken to his home? Burqa? I didn't observe that, sir. Subba Rao, summon the laundress. OK, sir. Come on, sir. I can never make that mistake. Those clothes belongs to them, sir. How long since you known them? Not even a week since they have occupied that house, sir. They said they've been staying there since six months, sir. We've been here since six months. Moreover, their gas and electricity bill were authentic. The problem is not with the bill, but with the burqa, Subba Rao. Hello, Mr Satyanarayana. May I come in? You... You have applied for passport, haven't you? But the passport enquiry was done! There are no limits for cop enquiry and a crazy guy's first night, sire! It might happen any number of times. Whoa! All our Gods are here. Seems like Mr Satyanarayana is very religious. You have filled the entire wall with deity's posters. Oh! Mrs Annapoorna. You seem very traditional just like your name. Will you please give me a glass of cool water with your sacred hands? -Okay. -Wow! What a culture! You have managed everything very well, but... Wonder what's with this burqa? I am asking you, Mr Satyanarayana. What's with this burqa? You came for an enquiry. Take as much amount as you want and bugger off. How much amount will you pay? Two. Come on, two is very cheap. Five. Thousands or lakhs? Hey... Do you know Saleem Bhatkal? Who is he? Is he the tailor who stitched this burqa? Hey... Do you know my background? Background! [electricity crackles] What a shame! Annapoorna has become Gun-poorna. Let's talk about your background! -Subba Rao, handle Gun-poorna. -Okay, sir. [saw screeching] I know every inch of Kurnool town. No matter which way you run, you have to end up coming here. Ow! SRI BALAJI JEWELLERS Ow! Background? Should I have to know your background? Come on, show it to me. Come on. Turn the camera. Come on, where is your background? Where is it? Background? Come on, show it to me. Background, my foot! Treat him with soda! [screams in pain] Why is he making him drink lemon soda in the morning, sir? [screams in pain] He uttered the forbidden word. And it triggered my boss's anger. That's why he is giving him the special soda. [screams in pain] Do you like this background or do you want me to make you try another soda? Lemon Soda. [siren wailing] Dear Shankar, why are you bashing him? [screams in pain] First, put on his pants! The media is watching us. Dear, do you even know who he is? I'm least concerned about who he is, sir. He uttered the word which I hate and I have bashed him up. Oh no! The guy you have bashed up is none other than Saleem Bhatkal, who is the most wanted criminal in India. Saleem Bhat... Sir... -Him? -Yes, dear. Well, I couldn't recognise because of his clean shaved face, sir. If Satyanarayana is Saleem Bhatkal... then, who is this Annapoorna? Oh no! She is not Annapoorna, but heroine Deepthi Bedi. Deepthi Bedi? Ah! Deep... Deepthi Bedi? Heroine Deepthi Bedi? Sorry, madam, for not recognising you. Sorry, sir, for not controlling myself. Please give an autograph. Here. Here... Here... Please click a photo. Come on, click a photo. Madam, please lay your hand on my shoulder. Please... [overlap of voices of reporters] Sir... Sir... Sir... You've nabbed the most wanted criminal of the country so easily. Can you explain your plan of action? Well, I did as per my SP's instructions. The whole credit goes to him. He was the one who devised the plan and the plan of action. The gun belongs to him and he was the one who pulled the trigger. I just worked like a bullet. That's it. I am a die-hard fan of SP. He is my inspiration. He is the reason for my current position. Mwah! This fifty rupees has changed the house which I was supposed to go. It changed my life in the hands of Shankar. It made me a joker and made me sit in front of you. Can I ask you something, off the record? Yes. What do you intend to do to Shankar? I want to come out of prison and kill him. It's been many years that you have come to jail. Do you know where Shankar is? Yes. He got transferred to Kadapa as CI, an hour ago. [horns blaring] Doctor... Brother-in-law, you have arrived! Greetings, doctor. Doctor, you have to somehow save me. Don't worry. Please sit down. What's your problem? Tell him. I have been suffering from a strange disease since recent times. No problem. You came to the right place. I have FRCS degree from London. -Yes. -Tell me your problem without hesitation. My anger goes out of bounds when someone touches my belongings. When I wish for something and can't get it, I get very tensed -I want to strangle and kill them. -Is it? True. Give me your hand. Oh man! Oh no! You are having bipolar disorder. Advanced stage. Will I die then? You won't die but you'd behave violently. You'd crave to commit a murder or rape. If I am not wrong, it's been a week that you had slept or eaten. Am I right? [whimpers] Hey... -Brother-in-law... -Relax... Relax... You are hundred percent correct, doctor. Hundred percent correct. You are great, doctor! You held my pulse and spoke about my problem as if you have seen. -Subba Reddy. -Brother-in-law... Tell the doctor why I couldn't sleep from the past one week. I will tell him, brother-in-law. Doctor, the thing is that... Recently when we were off to Jammalamadugu about a court issue, he asked to pull over to pee. When he got down, he was shocked at what he saw. 20 acres of mango plantation spread across a single bit of land, all fenced. -Tell him why I can't eat, as well. -Yes, I will tell him, brother-in-law. The thing is that, we attended a feast at Siva Reddy's place on the day of his elder daughter's puberty function. We came outside after the feast to smoke and have Paan and to our surprise, there was a big European structured building in front of us. He became upset for not having such a building for him and he's been yearning from that day and couldn't eat anything. Hmm... Those two properties belong to me, sir. Hmm... Understood? I bought them with my hard-earned money, sir. Will I give if you just ask? Brother-in-law, what did you do when some guy asked the same question recently? -What did he say? -What did I say? I took a boulder beside and smashed his head. Hey doctor, [trembles] you know my disease and its stage as well. Here... Sign it now! May all evil eyes from the knives, weapons, lands etc should be warded off. -Put this inside. -Yes. [dogs barking] Greetings, Mr Konda Reddy. -Sister, I want that mango. -Okay. Stay here. I'll go and get it for you. -Hey Subba Reddy -Yes, brother-in-law. -Go, settle the issue and return. -Okay, brother-in-law. Look Rangappa, if you act smart, you'll end up losing what you have. -That won't happen, sir. -Let's go. See you, sir. [snaps] [dogs growling] [dogs barking] [gasps] Oh mother... [kid crying] It is finished, dear. -Bear for a minute, it's done. -Oh mother... How can he set his dogs on a school going girl for the sake of a mere mango? Rascal! Have you filed a police complaint? Tell me, madam. Take the statement from the girl and file a case. Tell me, on whose name should I file the case against? Konda Reddy. [mobile rings] How are you doing, SP? I am doing fine, but I expect the same from you. What happened, SP? Was there any police case filed against you in the last 24 hours? Cases filed against Konda Reddy are like hair on the head. They just come and go. Do you know there was a case filed against you today, under section 324? It is an animal act. The case is about letting your dogs bite a school going girl. Oh! [laughing] That one? That's a petty case, SP. Of course, the case is petty but the officer who is dealing that case is not an ordinary person. Why are you getting so tensed, SP? We have come across a lot of such officers. You might have come across many such officers, Reddy. But he is a hot-headed guy! He won't be alive if he meddles with me. A lot of thugs who meddled with him have bitten dust, Reddy. [shot fired] [shots fired] If you want to stay alive... How far is Rajahmundry Central Jail from your place? Central Jail? It is just 6 hours away, if we drive fast. Then, be on it. Go there within 4 hours and meet the jailor. RAJAHMUNDRY 121 KMS He'd show you a guy who would tell you about that officer. RAJAHMUNDRY CENTRAL JAIL The SP of Kadapa has sent me here. Why did you bring me here? The guy you seek is here. Come with me. Where is he? That's the man. Hey... This tastes bland. Get some salt. The SP made such a big hype to meet... this mere cook? Where do you hail from? Kadapa. How many vehicles did you bring here? Three. He brought six vehicles. How many would accompany you while you leave your home? A maximum of ten people. A minimum of 25 people accompany him when he goes out. How many murders have you committed? Many! 12 of them. He has committed 22 murders. And 30 more murders were committed on his behalf. Total of 52 murders, only what we know. Who is this notorious thug that I am unaware of? He is Katari Krishna from Ongole. Do you know how Katari Krishna's story began? Do you know how it all began? In the days when Pulavarthi Sreenu was reigning rowdyism in Ongole, Katari Krishna and Jayamma worked in that gang. What are those, boss? They are country made bombs. Do things work with those bombs? We have to make a series of stabbing to kill someone, if we use knives. If we use axes, we have to keep striking until they die. But when it comes to this bomb, we can just throw and those wastrels would be dead at once. Is it? Yes. I want to see them once, boss. Go ahead. Hey... Please give me once, brother. [explosion] "Kata... Kata... Katari is a savage" "He is a sly with the heart of a stone" "He terrorises and sends chills down people's spine" "Once he eyes upon a village, it will dilapidate" "Katari always goes with his hunting knife" "He is always up for chaos" "He climbs on the pile of dead bodies step by step" "And throws a challenge at opponent's turf" [stabs] [slits] [crowd whistles] [slits] "Kata... Kata... Katari is a savage" "He is a sly with the heart of a stone" "He terrorises and sends chills down people's spine" "Once he eyes upon a village, it will dilapidate" Tell me, little brother. Our Kadapa SP has asked me to meet you on an urgent basis, brother. Did he come to your town? Who are you talking about? Did CI Shankar arrive in your town? I was told that he was arriving. What is this big hype about him? What's with you and what's with the story I heard about you outside? And what are you doing here? I, who lived in Ongole with pride and high stature at one point of time, am now sitting in jail like a fool before you, the reason is... this nail. Nail! This nail! A nail? Some people want success and everyone wants to live life to the fullest. The opponents' hopes on their lives is the strength to budding thugs like me. I made money on people's ashes. Every dead body that showed up has got my signature. The entire Ongole was in my lap. In the due course, my strength and entourage have grown. [camera clicks] Along with them, I have developed a weakness as well. My daughter. What is the progress of elections? -These elections are tormenting. -Thank you. Elections has become an expensive affair these days. For me to contest as MLA again, I need to at least spend 50 crore rupees. Let me know if you have any interest. -I'll talk to the high command -Hi dude! and get you a party ticket. -Who told you, Ongole has gone dry? -What you have to do is-- I have just played tennis with a hot girl. While I was playing with one ball, I saw two more. I will get her to the guest house within two days... and I'll play a live match with her. [glass shatters] [exclaims] I don't care if someone talks bad about me, Koteshwar Rao. But that rogue has struck on my heart. Shouldn't he deserve such a big blow? Err... He does. A new CI is posted to Ongole One Town police station. [siren wailing] Hey... Trains at the railway station and policemen at the police station... ...would come and go. As if this is big news! As if this is worthy of publishing and reading! It is a waste of our tea-time. Let's see what would this new guy achieve! Achieve my foot! Meanwhile, get the fritters packet. -Okay. -Hey... Pay the amount, sir. [people protesting] Ban it! Ban it! Ban the film 'Thaata Theestha'! -Switch off the camera. -Mad Gangadhar... What is this? What's with this silent protest? We can't even telecast it on a local channel. If you want this to get telecasted on a state channel, there should be emotion. Ban it! Ban it on emotional grounds! [people protesting] [siren wailing] [protesting] Ban it! Ban it on emotional grounds! [protesting] Ban it! Ban it on emotional grounds! Ban it on emotional grounds! What should be banned? [camera captures] The newly released movie 'Thaata Theestha' has the depiction of people of my caste as villains which is an insult to us. -Oh! -Are people of my caste villains? Wouldn't there be any heroes? Is it that people of my caste commit rapes? Wouldn't they fall in love? This agitation wouldn't stop until the director 'Mad Gangadhar' apologises to us. Otherwise, we'll take them to the task! You've been calling him as Mad person, right? Why are you still staying here? -Disperse. Disperse, all of you. -How can we just leave? It has hurt our sentiments. Sentiments? What does it mean? Sentiments mean... Something that gets hurt at the time of a film release. -Yes, those things! -Oh! Wow! Wow! I, now, clearly understand the mental status of all of you. Hey, pass it. [groans] [groans] [groans] [groans] Sir... Sir... Please don't hit us. We don't belong to this caste. Then, why are you here? We came here on the pretext of seeing ourselves on the television. But you were going overboard a while ago? Sir, we did this because that media guy provoked us. He is the one. What is that? Him? -Yes, sir. -Hey, come here. Wow! Your walking style is mindblowing! Wow! How come you walked so heroically? Media! Eyes and ears for society. Wow! My cutie boy! My darling! Give me a hug, dear. With pleasure. Ew! Yuck! Yuck! When was the last time you took a head bath? It is been two weeks, sir. What's the problem? Water scarcity in Ongole. This one... This one is what genuine problem is. -Sorry, sir. -Focus on such issues. If you ever come to this side or provoke people, you're so done Switch off the cameras and run away, guys! [in unison] Morning, sir. -I am SI Tilak, sir. -Srinu, sir. -Appa Rao, sir. -Ramulu, sir. That was a rocking entry, sir. You gave a nice touch of your style, sir. -You didn't say your name? -Balaji, sir. Sai Kumar, sir. Are you a cinephile? Yeah. Hmm... Whoa! -Abdullah, sir. -Ashok Kumar, sir. Constable Kiran, sir. Welcome to Ongole, sir. Thank you. You are my inspiration, sir The town might not know this, but the entire department knows that you're the one who caught Saleem Bhatkal. I'm the son of Mr Raju, the head constable who worked with you at Kurnool and retired, sir. -Hey, is it? -Yes, sir. -How is Mr Raju doing? -He is doing good, sir. -Convey my regards to him. -Sure, sir. Dosa... Dosa... Getting it in a moment son! You shouldn't eat food so quickly, kiddo. This crazy kiddo can't distinguish between asking and screaming. Eat. Oh no! It is spicy! Is it so spicy? Let me get sugar for you. My father called. Hmm. What's the matter? He said, "Ongole has a too many thugs and your husband has too much anger." "He will go against them without a second thought." "Ask him to be a little careful." Honey, will you ask your father to do something? If he has got no work to do, I will buy four acres of land, some buffaloes and pigs for him. Ask him to milk them and sell the milk. Everyone is always ready to give free advice. I don't know why. Come on, eat. And anger kicks in! Hello! I'm talking to you! I don't want it either. Huh? Hey, what happened to you? Mom got angry. So do I. Huh? Hey... Hey... Oh man! What's with their anger? They neither eat nor let me eat. -Mom -Yes. I'd anyway wake up in the hall, in the morning. Shall I sleep there? No, sleep here. That won't happen today. Why not, darling? Somnambulism affects regularly, isn't it? It won't be there today. Why wouldn't it be there today, dad? The thing is that... Come here, I'll explain. Your mom doesn't know anything. Be it at the classroom or the bedroom, the time-table shouldn't be missed. Every subject has to be taught at it's own hour! But that wouldn't when the teacher is on leave! Wow! My dear son! You've inherited all your mom's sharpness! Go to sleep, young devil! Go to sleep. -Kallu... -Hmph! Whoa! This means no chance. [sighs] Sleep, dear. Sleep... -Dad! -[gasps] It is you who's been making me sleep in the hall every day, aren't you? No, I am patting to put you to sleep. Patting you. Sleep, dear. Sleep... Go to sleep. Sleep, dear. Sleep... Sleep, son. Sleep... Phew! I won't go anywhere. I will stay here. Okay? Sleep, dear. Sleep... Mom, is this somnambulism? Hey, just sleep. Moustache... Mr. Moustache. Somnambulism Hmm... Woohoo! -Darling, it's been already so late. -Hmm... Hmm... First, tell me something. I can't resist answering or doing anything you ask, at this time. Come on, shoot. Am I your first wife or is it your job? Both are the same to me. You are my first wife and the job is my elder wife. You are uncatchable! "Don't know what relation you have with the uniform you wear!" "Don't know how it made it to you" "It has your interest and is kicking me out now!" "It's not letting me have your time!" "You take care of its mess now, dear husband!" "Angry cop! Take care of me too!" "Let me be with you like the stars on your chest" "Don't know what relation you have with the uniform you wear!" "Don't know how it made it to you" "You don't remember anything once you are engulfed in work" "I can't be peaceful once you leave to work" "Longing for you and love together" "All the time goes in your thoughts" "Any bell I hear ringing, I remember you" "I always pray for your safety" "You are my world and my life is with you" "Angry cop! Take care of me too!" "Let me be with you like the stars on your chest" "Don't know what relation you have with the uniform you wear!" "Don't know how it made it to you" [mobile ringing] -Order a tea, Kiran. -OK, sir. Hello... I heard that you have newly arrived at the station. Don't you know to pay a visit when you come to the town? Who the hell are you? I am the local leader. If you ever come across me anywhere due to your ill-fate or bad time, I'll bash you so bad that neither your family nor others would identify you. -Hey... -Hey! Shut it! Bloody wastrel and your annoying baritone! Hang up! Local leader, my foot! What, Kiran? Why are you smiling? If you don't mind, can I ask you something, sir? Go ahead. -My father was right about you. -Which was? that you are a hot-headed guy. Sorry, sir. Why are you so angered by the word 'background', sir? I have grown up as an orphan since childhood, Kiran. Wherever I went, everyone has asked me about my background and irritated me terribly. As if that is a license to wear around one's neck! That's why that word enrages me a lot. I don't know why... I lose control. But I will try to control. Huh! Shall we go? Okay, sir. -Didn't remember me even once? -I didn't forget you at all! You are here. Where? Jayamma, how is the movie? The movie is good but your daughter's activities aren't. What are you talking? Your daughter too came to the movie, Krishna. Shouldn't she go to a movie? There was a guy beside her. I think he is her boyfriend. He's been laying hands and whispering to her ears in the dark. Wouldn't that seem disgusting? Did you see properly? Yes. I saw them with my own eyes. I know you'd feel sad when I tell you this, Krishna. As it is a matter of a girl, it's not good if it goes public. We have to conceal it secretly. Conceal my foot... Look, don't get aggressive in this manner. You have recently killed some guy in public. Not again. Moreover, he is a cop. We have to look before we leap. Go to Vetapalem. [bus honking] [bus honking] ONGOLE TO VETAPALEM Give me a soda. [spits] [flies buzzing] [whistling] [roars] [panting] What is it, Ankudu? Why are you running under the sun? We have consumed donkey's blood, Jayamma. The body needs such a workout to digest it. Otherwise, the blood will coagulate and we'll die. [breathes heavily] What task brings you here? Krishna has got some task for you. It's his personal. Hey... Hey... Wait. Here... -Eat it hot upon reaching the station. -Okay, mom. Drive safely. Dad might forget to take pills on time. Remind him. -Okay. -See you. Bye. [rocket whistling] [rocket blasts] [footsteps running] [headlight broken] [Kiran groans in pain] [Kiran groaning] Ah! [Kiran groaning] [Kiran screams] Throw the stone! [eagle squeals] [dogs growling] [no voice] [sobbing] I have done many postmortems in my service. But this is the first time in my life I've come across such a brutal killing. Generally, people commit murders out of vengeance or grudge. But these killers have done it as if it is a sport of hunting. They made their first blow on the neck. Later, they have gone for legs. This pattern is called wolf-attack, in general. Did you encounter such cases earlier? Well... I came to know that my senior colleague has dealt a similar case before. Where is he now? He lives in this town but he is retired now. -Okay. Thank you, doctor. -That's okay. Balaji... Mr Raju, trust me. I will not spare anyone who were involved in Kiran's murder. I swear on my uniform. Be brave. There were 15 similar cases, on which I have performed postmortem. In some cases, there were only bodies with no heads. The murder of your constable took place in a similar fashion. Same old signature style. I have sent all the reports of postmortem which I have done, to the concerned police stations. Our hospital has the copies of the same reports as well. You can go through them if necessary. -Thank you so much for the info, sir. -It's okay. -I'll see you again if needed. -Welcome. Thank you, sir. Tilak, Balaji, Sai... All of you, come here. These are the post mortem reports. Get info on which police stations in the district have registered the cases related to these post mortem reports. Then, get the related FIRs, charge sheets, witness list along with their addresses and the put them in front of me within 24 hours. Fast! [in unison] Okay, sir. This is the case which got registered in the year 2005. Do the FIR files of that time still exist? How come you don't have the FIR copies, sir? Six years ago, on the occasion of Diwali... burning of crackers led to a fire accident in the station which resulted in burning of many files and FIRs. How come? Haven't they digitalised them? The digitalisation process has started just five years ago. That's why those old reports have no digital information, sir. Sir, the slippers found in the crime scene were made of buffalo's skin. When I have enquired about them, I was told that the cobblers who make such slippers live in Gaddalakunta, sir. Then, did you enquire them? We did, sir. But we were told that those families left the village 10 years ago. The CI who dealt this case was assigned to investigate Vijayawada's Durga temple robbery case. So, this case has been pushed into old cases. As the latter officers didn't bother about the case, it has remained as pending. We ran enquiry in all the police stations related to the 15 cases... ...and got the details, sir. But there's been no response from one station. -Which station? -Kandukuru station, sir. Kandukuru station. What's the matter? My elder sister is missing, sir. We tried calling her but her phone is switched off. What's her age? 25 years old, sir. It is automatically, the right age to go missing! I think your elder daughter is good looking too. Some guy might have automatically bumped into her. My daughter is not such a girl, sir. Of course, this is what everyone would claim automatically. My final say is that... Stop thinking about your elder daughter who eloped, and prevent your younger daughter from eloping, automatically. Leave now. I need to go through old records. Aren't there any rules or limits? This station isn't yours. It's mine. Anyhow, would turning old pages bring back lost lives or make the deadman come alive? What do you say? [ears ringing] The one who died is a policeman just like you and me. Can I see those records now? This is the FIR of ex-MLA Mr Subbiah's murder case that happened 10 years ago. This is lying in your station gathering dust. Hindus value Bhagad Gita, Christians value Bible, Muslims value Koran and the police value FIR. But it remained as a rough paper in your station. I don't have the rights to take action against you. If I had those rights, I would have taken your life, instead of your job. Don't worry, madam. He will solve this case himself... automatically! The only evidence we have is this FIR. The enquiry was stopped because the suspects were not found. Suspect 1: Vontimukkala Rama Rao. Who the hell is he? He died four years ago, sir. Suspect 2: Chinna Basha. Who the hell is he? I have enquired about him. He has committed suicide in Nellore jail. Yes, sir. Suspect 3: Katari Krishna. Who the hell is he? -Katari Krishna is Ongole's-- -Ongole's, what? Big gun sir. So, he is not a human. Where is he? What scares you? Where can he be found? Look at your daughter. She's been smiling as if nothing happened despite her loved one being dead. [chuckles] She has inherited all your traits. You guys won't value lives at all. He is the newly appointed CI of One Town station. I think I saw you somewhere. Got it! I have recently got a police officer transferred to the punishment area. For a moment, I mistook you for him. Is it, Mr Krishna? Recently at Addanki Bus Stand centre, I have thrashed the hell out of a crooked person who was teasing girls. And for a moment, I mistook you for him wondering how he sits at the fair wearing new clothes. Are you here as a part of security? I came here to meet you. -Hey! -Yes, madam. Bring a chair for the officer. What's the matter? Our constable Kiran was killed. While I was inquiring about that case, I checked the FIR filed at Kandukur station ten years ago... ...and your name was mentioned as a suspect. That is a similar case too. If you come to the station for 10 minutes, we will just enquire and drop you off. Shall we go? This is a fair which is organised by 20 villages and happens only once a year. And that should be run by me single-handedly. I can't come now. Meet me later. If there is no deity, the fair would be stopped. If there is no priest, the pooja would be stopped. If there are no percussions, the sound would come to an end. But nothing would stop if you are not here. So come to the station for just 10 minutes, sir. Station? How does it look? I haven't seen it before. Guys, have we ever seen a police station before? [laughing] Oh my! Why are you laughing? It reminded me of my childhood Telugu teacher's catchphrase. What is it? 'Hey, Tom, Dick, and Harry... I couldn't care less about who you are.' I've been watching you since you arrived. I didn't see any fear in your eyes. You are just aware of my name as Katari Krishna! But you aren't aware of the background behind that name! Background! [groans] Hey... Hey cop! How dare you lay hands on Katari Krishna in Singarakonda fair? I'll slit your neck! Katari Krishna himself shut it and is coming with me. What's your issue being just a mistress? Huh? I'll shave you bald! Sir! Hey! Stop him. You said didn't see how a police station looks like. Look, this is how a police station looks from outside. Now, let me take you to a tour inside the police station. Look... Come on, look. Take a proper look around, Kitty. This is how an interior of the police station looks like. Are you looking or not? Come on, look. Come on, look. Take a good look. This is how it looks when you are locked up. Remember the name of the person who locked you up! It is Shankar. Potharaju Veera Shankar. You have to pee in your pants when you think about One Town station, rascal! So, he has hit you there and you have ended up in this jail. No, brother. The real turmoil between us started only then. -Sir, tea. -Give it to him. Yellamanda, he's not someone who flees but someone who bashes till one pees. I agree, Gulabi. He is no ordinary guy. He has locked up Katari Krishna on a Friday depriving him of getting a bail on Saturday and Sunday. Today is the third day. I can only imagine the hell he is seeing. -I think she is Jayamma -Needn't think, that's Jayamma indeed. Is she here with lunch? -Maybe she's got a bail. -Oh! Come, let's see. -Return the glasses! -We will do that tomorrow. Where is the SI? Over there. Hey, cop! Here are the bail papers. Open it! Open it! Open the cell. Please wait for the CI to arrive. Hey! Why should I wait? -Give me the keys! Give it! -Madam. -Open the cell or give it to me. -Madam. -Give me the keys. -Madam, please wait. -Give the keys to me man! -Madam, please. [grunts] [tyres screeching] Tilak! Order a coffee for me. How come he ignores so many people present here? Calm down, madam. Getting bail is our priority. If he overhears you, he'll extend Krishna's lock up for a week. Sir, please tell him. Sir... the bail papers. Hey Kitty! I locked you up for three days just because you are a third suspect in the FIR that was filed 10 years ago in Kandukuru Police station. But if it turns out that you are behind the murder of our constable Kiran, I'll make you stand stark naked on a busy street of Ongole... and stuff molten lead in all your openings, rascal! Get lost! -[overlap of voices] Sir... Sir... -Hey! Out of the way! Rama Krishna! -Out of the way! Out of the way! -Move... We fell in love with each other. But I've been scared of you all these days and refrained from getting married. But now, a real man has come to this town and he is in this station. That courage has made me stand boldly in front of you. We have killed the guy she fell in love with! Then, who the hell is he? What happened? Something went wrong, Krishna. There's been a mistake, sir. I and Nitya fell in love with each other. Our love is the reason for Kiran's death sir. Kiran accompanied us to the movie on that day sir. I was supposed to die, instead of Kiran. It was me who was supposed to drop Nitya, sir. That was a good film. Makes a good watch. That heroine performed very well! [groans in pain] -What happened Balaji? -Ah! What happened, dude? Come let us go to a hospital. No need man, first drop Nitya at her home. -Hey! -Well... She will end up in trouble if she reaches home late. -Go with him. -OK, go to a hospital. -Come. -I will take care. -You go. -Fine, take care. If I wouldn't have got hurt by the nail, Kiran wouldn't have gone to drop Nitya sir. Jayamma saw them and thought that it was Kiran who loved Nitya. And Krishna's men have brutally killed Kiran, sir. I was scared that they will kill me too, if this comes out. So I didn't tell this to anyone until now, sir. But when you hit Krishna the other day, I've mustered the courage. So, I married her and came to you, sir. I am sorry, sir. I am the witness for the incident, sir. Say the same thing in the statement. -Tilak! -Sir? Get the station warrant ready. I'll drag him from inside his home... Sir... If you don't mind, I have a suggestion. He will go legally citing the deceased and the witness being cops. No matter how many times we lock him up without strong evidence, he'll somehow escape. Either we should get a strong evidence or he must do a mistake. Let us wait until then, sir. Do we need to wait until he commits a mistake? I will make him commit it. Only the people in this station know that his daughter got married to Balaji. The entire town should know this. Put up the hoardings! Hey, Gulabi! Look oh look! Look here... Oh my God! Constable's wedding with Katari Krishna's daughter. By erecting this banner, he dented Krishna's reputation permanently. Krishna, I came to the town knowing the situation. I felt very sad seeing the hoardings in the town. I wouldn't have let this happen if I was here. Don't worry. I will get him transferred to some place using my influence. -Where will you transfer him, sir? -Wherever I can. Guntur or Nellore. Okay, let us think he has been transfered. But do you know what people would think? They'd say, "C I Shankar has bashed Katari Krishna like a dog in Ongole" "And Krishna pleaded officers to get him transferred here." SP, I will only lost my reputation when he raised his hand on me. But I'll lose my life if he gets transferred to some other district. He should stay in the same station, roam around in this town, I should chop him into pieces in front of these people, Chop him into pieces. Why is his wife here strangely? Oh dear... Mr. Krishna, see you. She is our only daughter. Don't kill her. I know how much you like her. You will even kill the people you like if they go against you. Let my daughter live. Please promise me you wouldn't kill her. [breaks into tears] Promise me. [singing] -Thank you very much. -Congratulations. -Thank you. -Thank you. [in unison]: Greetings, sir. -Good evening, sir. -Very good evening! -Hi sir! -Hello, sir! Hmm, what's up, Tilak? -Is everything under control? -Yes, sir. Okay. Are the men related to Kitty here? -Most of them have come, sir. -Most of them? Very good! -Who are they? -Local talent, sir. Oh no! This isn't enough, can't hear the sound at least till the end of the street. Our noise here should reverberate in Kitty's ears. What? Clear them all from here and... [groans signalling] "Whenever there is a celebration around" "I'm always the first guest" "In the middle of thumping beats..." "My solo song is a must" All the best! "I was born in Chimakurthy" "Attained my youth in Chinaganjam" "I spread my beauty around" "I left both the Telugu states shaken" "It's the same old thing that happens everywhere" "Everyone moves towards me irrespective of their age!" "Unable to bear the trouble and seeing their efforts" "I threw some flying kisses around" [throwing flying kisses] "The sound of my kisses creates a boom" "I'll give you one too, stay lined up" "The sound of my kisses creates a boom" "I'm the most happening one nowadays" "I was born in Chimakurthy" "Attained my youth in Chinaganjam" "I spread my beauty around" "I left both the Telugu states shaken" "Your curly hair is so cute, I remember our Latha Lakshmi from Tangutur" "Your smile sends chills across and is making me younger" "Let me come up on stage and put a garland of notes on you" "Let me embrace your hips once!" "Your curly hair is so cute, I remember our Latha Lakshmi from Tangutur" "DJ... DJ... DJ... DJ..." "It's not DJ, but OJ. Ongole Jathara (Fair)!" "OJ... OJ... OJ..." "Such an orchestra dance is a lucky chance for you" "I thank you all my fans, I love you!" "I'll make sure you are gifted well this night" "This rejuvenation doesn't have a tax, keep scoring all night" "Your looks and attitude are so good that they make you better than beauty queens" "The king of the station has come to the fun town, feed me well" [throwing kisses] "The sound of my kisses creates a boom" "I'll give you one too, stay lined up" "The sound of my kisses creates a boom" "I'm the most happening one nowadays" "I was born in Chimakurthy" "Attained my youth in Chinaganjam" "I spread my beauty around" "I left both the Telugu states shaken" Mom! I pray to God that both of should have a long and happy life. Please leave this town for some time. I know about your father. He isn't human. I wish that you should live happily with your husband, wherever you are. Leave this town. You don't worry. I am there for them. Was this wedding for the sake of their happiness or your adamant move? I can't live if I lose my daughter in your disputes. I am asking you as a mother. Please understand. Send them to some place. I married your daughter, after being prepared for everything. Balaji, she is right. You both shouldn't suffer because of my disputes with her father. I will send them out of town tonight. I am leaving it by trusting you. Please send them out of town personally. You can be assured. Mom... Where have you been? I am asking you! Where are you coming from? Do you know that a wife is called Sahadharmacharini. Which means, I should share half of your duties. I brought your daughter, her husband and that cop at one place. Now prove that you are a man enough. Women have children with their husbands in this town. But I thought that my daughter was born to a real man. Your manliness is mine. Hack the one who hit you and the guy who married your daughter. Bring back your lost honour and my daughter. AP STATE ROAD TRANSPORT CORPORATION PRAKASAM DIST BUS STATION, ONGOLE ONGOLE TO HYDERABAD -Get in. -OK, sir. -Take it. -Sir, thank you so much. Call me if you need anything. -Sure sir. -Take care dear. Okay, sir. A power cut at 8 pm in Ongole certainly indicates a murder event. [groans] [glass shatters] [lights shatter] [glass shatters] [knife slits] [knife slits] Nitya, follow me, quick. Balaji! Balaji! Aim correctly man! [groans] Sir! [bottle shatters] [bottles shattering] [groaning] [groans in pain] [groans] [siren wailing] [panting] He is here. Hey, Kitty! Where is she? Where is the great actress? Call your wife, man! Where is she? I can't see her. Where is the great actress? Ah! Oh my Goodness! You look so innocent like actress Sridevi. But you hatch plots like Bandit Queen. I am asking you as a mother, you should save my daughter's husband. Please, son. Please. Oh my God! What a realistic performance! Hats off! Hey, Kitty... your wife is a big actress! Try her in movies. You can live happily managing her schedules. Why do you need rowdyism? Dacoit bastard! Hey! You are still alive because your time is running good. Huh! It's not because my time is running good. It is because yours is running bad. Killing people is one of your needs, but it is one of my responsibilities. You might have a weapon at home. But it comes inbuilt with my uniform. A cop gets trained not to pull his gun out. But if he takes it out, it will be a sure shot. There is no doubt about it. He will blow your brains out. -Hey! -Hey you! What's with you? You are not a match to fight with me. If the people outside come to know that I have hit you, they'd crack jokes at me. I'd assign you an easy task. Bring that chair and keep it here. Now go and stand in your position. Make it fast! Your daughter, for whom you have planned these activities for, would be having her first night with our constable, today... in my house. Note down the address. Sujatha Nagar Police Quarters. I'd book a taxi if you want to come alone. I'll book a lorry, if you want to come with your men. Come there! Will you come? You! [glass breaks] My daughter is dead to me from this moment. Now, you are my only target from now. I will think about her only after killing you. If I don't hack you and hang you at the Addanki Bus Station, my name wouldn't be Katari Krishna anymore. Awesome! [whistles] Son of a gun! This is real manliness! You proved yourself as a real man now! Be prepared to change your name. It won't be Katari Krishna anymore. It would be 'Saree-Krishna'. Alright! Shall I leave now? Okay! Speak out! Speak out! It's okay, Tilak. Did Srinu speak anything or not? I don't understand what he's been eating and drinking, sir. Though I have bashed him for three days breaking thirty batons but he didn't utter a word. Ah, Tilak... you bashed him very badly. Hmm, Srinu now tell me. Who told you to kill our constable Kiran? Uh! Uh! [screaming in pain] Ice pack, Tilak. This is only for now. If time passes, I don't know what I'd end up cutting. [telephone rings] Yeah... tell me? Guntur Srinu spilled the beans and revealed Jayamma's name, sir. Shankar has started to your place. Fine, I will take care. Today is Friday, right? Aren't you going to a movie? Tsk! Forget movies, Krishna! After seeing you in this situation, I don't feel like watching movies. I am freaking scared that Srinu might divulge about you. He didn't. Didn't I tell you that our Vetapalem people are very trustworthy? [scoffs] Don't think about this anymore. Go and watch a film happily. -Are you sure? -Yes. Hmm, alright. -Jayamma -Huh? Come here. Do you want me to stay or what? I will watch the movie later. Tsk! Don't do that. Don't compromise on your passions for my sake. What could I like more than you? It's getting late Jayamma. Go quickly. Okay. [mobile phone rings] What is it, boss? You never call me usually! I have got a task for you. Customarily, Jayamma is supposed to call me? It is Jayamma whom you should kill. [gasps] How come you want our Jayamma to be killed, boss? She's been everything to me for 15 years. But I have no choice now. Srinu spilt the beans in the police station. If she gets caught, cops will torture her until she reveals my name. I wouldn't be able to tolerate her being tortured. I can't tolerate if she reveals my name, as well. They are going to kill our Jayamma? Jayamma... Jayamma... Kill her without inflicting pain. Okay, boss. CI Veera Shankar responding. Sir, I got the information that Jayamma is in Navabharat theatre. Okay and out. Go to Navabharat theatre. [crowd whistling and applauding] What is it, Suri? Jayamma... Krishna ordered... Krishna ordered Ankadu to kill you, Jayamma. Krishna, what? Hey! Shh! They are coming to kill you, Jayamma. Run away, Jayamma... I can't hear you. Wait, I am coming out. Oh no! Jayamma. [whistles and applause] [telephone rings] I wonder if Krishna is safe. [telephone rings] Why isn't Krishna answering my call? [mobile rings] What happened to Krishna? Jayamma, Krishna assigned Ankadu to kill you. -What? -They are out to kill you. [Ankadu]: Krishna would be safe Jayamma. Hey, Ankadu! Why are you guys roaming outside? [siren wailing] The cops are here. You will get caught. Run away. Why are you guys standing still? Go to our Vetapalem. What is it, guys? Run away. Krishna ordered us to kill you, Jayamma. [groans] Balaji! Tilak! [Ankadu groans] [shot fired] [commotion] [voice muted] [voice muted] [commotion continues] Yeah, okay. Alright! The game has begun, Shankar. Katari Krishna has regained his form now. I will play with the uniform on your body, I will play with the trust of Ongole people have on you. [mobile rings] Hey, Kathi! CI Shankar has killed a person who belongs to your caste. What you will do now? I was waiting for the chance. I got him now. I'll set the entire town on fire and I will show the power of my caste. VEERA SHANKAR SHOULD BE PUNISHED An innocent civilian lost his life in the shootout today near Navabharat theatre. Caste-based and political groups are agitating to arrrest C. I. Shankar... and the entire Ongole town is hot. There are protests and roadblocks in town condemning CI Shankar's negligence. The human rights organisation has called for a lockdown, and has also released a bulletin questioning the Police system, and wrote a letter to the State Home Ministry seeking action on CI Shankar. How would government react-- [sighs] What is this, Shankar? Don't you know how careful you should be when using a gun in the public? Sir, I shot the suspect. But the one who is dead is an innocent. The people, who whistled when you have bashed Krishna, are now angrily waiting to pelt stones at you. What is this? You have hit the CI in the Kandukuru police station. You have bashed Katari Krishna in the name of enquiry. You have tortured Guntur Srinu in the name of interrogation. And he is dead now. And now, you shot a young guy in the public. I gave you a free hand as you have caught Saleem, but you've misused it. You kept doing mistakes because of your emotions. Now, I got the orders from higher officials, to suspend you. -What you want me to do now? -I am sorry, sir. A commission would come for an enquiry on you, next week. Sir. Give your explaination there. You may go now. -Namasthe, sir. -Needn't salute him. Hand down. When one keeps beating anyone in their path, because of the uniform, this would be the expected result... automatically. -They have suspended him. -He might hear it. -[scoffs] Let him listen. -Is that okay? -What is the case? -We gave foot in mouth statement. -Unknowing misbehaviour with SPs relative. -Yelavanda. Oh my goodness! It's you. It's Mr. Shankar! I thought you are some home guard as you don't have a hat and a belt. By the way... What was it that you were blabbering the other day? Ah! A cop gets trained not to use his gun. As this would be the result if he does? I got it. In my childhood, my Telugu teacher too had a catchphrase. 'When success starts showing up, everything keeps coming one by one' 'But when losing begins, everything would be lost at one go.' Now, you lost your uniform. All that is left now is your head resting on your neck. I will remove it too. And I will drink your blood. Hey, Kitty! Do you think my head is a tender coconut for anyone to cut it, and my blood is coconut water for anyone to drink? Bloody dacoit! I gave you a small break. Do whatever you want to do in this break. I will come back with breaking news. Uhuh! He still hasn't got rid of his hot-headed nature. [television playing] [kid laughing] -Dear... -[kid laughing] Lower the TV volume. Tsk! [kid laughing] -Hey! -[gasps] Can't you understand? Go inside! Go! Mom! [weeping] What did the kid do? I am asking you what did he do! This anger is the very reason a life is lost. And now, you are venting that on our kid? So... Are you blaming me too? I am not saying you did it intentionally. But it happened because of you! -Kalyani! -[gasps] Huh! You've known me for so long. When you don't understand me, how would the outsiders do? My Shankar isn't the regular guy who vents his frustration at his wife and children. If you are the same old Shankar, you wouldn't be worried about your lost job. You would think about the life that was lost. I don't know how he died. But your aggression has been killing your rational thinking. The mistake had happened at your end. You should know how it happened. Not knowing is also your mistake. Being a police officer, you should find out whose mistake it was. Whether it might be yours or someone else's. Being your wife, I should stay with you in this situation. But look how scared he is. You shouldn't look like a father who has done a mistake. Show up after correcting the mistake. Kalyani... Kalyani... If you were the same old Shankar, you wouldn't be worried about the lost job. You would think about the life which is lost. Being a cop you should find out whose mistake is this. Whether it might be yours or someone else's. [electricity crackling] [gun shots] [electricity crackling] [gun shots] I aimed at his leg. [gun shots] But the bullet hit his chest. There is no chance the bullet would bounce. This is the 9mm bullet I fired! How did a bullet of same guage hit the young man? Something is wrong! Constables! Sai, go get the ammunition record. What are you looking at? Go, get it! Yes! I have fired a bullet and there is one more bullet missing in the record. Where did it go wrong? Huh? I am asking you! Why aren't you silent? -Sir? -Tilak. Why are you here, sir? You were with me that day. We both were carrying weapons. One bullet was found on the spot but from where did the other bullet come from? How can it be possible sir? The bullet you fired is in the dead body. Even the same was confirmed in the postmortem report. Tilak I am not asking about the bullet found in the body. I am asking about the bullet which has been missing in the station. Where is it? -Give me your gun. -Why do you need my gun, sir? -Tilak, give your gun for once. -Sir, please. Why are you requesting me, when I'm asking for your gun? Tilak, hey! Tilak, stop there. [groans] Bloody villian! [groans in pain] You deceived me being by my side! Why did you shoot that guy? Speak out! I will say it, I will sir. To kill Ankadu. Why did you think of killing Ankadu? [Tilak groans] Tell me, tell me! Jayamma's name came up because of Guntur Srinu. I shot Ankadu while he was running after killing Jayamma, to prevent Krishna's name from coming out sir. [electricity crackling] [gun shots] But the bullet hit that guy by mistake and he died. It's me who leaked info to Krishna about every movement in this station, sir. Guntur Srinu has opened his mouth. He revealed Jayamma's name, sir. Alright, I will take care. Mr. Krishna, Shankar has been suspended. Krishna's men are present in every police station of Ongole district, sir. Just like me in this station. Hiding every FIR filed on Krishna, and killing any witnesses against Krishna, is our work sir. [chocking] Where did you hide the remaining FIR's, Tilak? Tell me, Tilak! Where did you hide them? Take them out. Take them out! If I wouldn't hide them, Krishna might have killed me long ago, sir. Would you tell the same thing before SP sir? Will you? Yes, yes. [mobile ringing] -Hello? -Hey, Shankar! Though you aren't wearing a uniform, you have proved that you are a cop. It's alright, bring the policeman with you along with the papers you have. Hey, Kitty your jokes are crossing boundaries! You are asking them as easily as my son asks candy. I know that you are a hot-headed person. and you won't listen to me. That is why I have sent my men to kill your wife and son, who went to her parental home. If you don't come here now, then they will start their work. Krishna sir, Krishna sir, please don't harm them, I beg you. Please, please Krishna sir, please don't harm my wife and son. Ah? Oh! He started calling me formally! Shankar... Shankar. Please Krishna sir, let both of us settle it, spare my wife and kid. Please Krishna sir... Krishna sir... Krishna sir... Krishna sir, hey, Kitty... Kitty... Are you expecting that I would come to your house and massage your feet, to plead you out of fear? You bloody flocker... -Hey! -Yes, tell me. Why are you laughing when I said your wife and son are going to die in sometime? Are you out of your mind? Or else do you remember any catchphrase of the teacher? Oh, I don't remember any quotes. Hey, Kitty... shall I tell you mind-blowing news? What's that? -Do I say it? -Hey, tell me! [metal clinks] Mom! Shh! Do you think my wife is someone... ...who would sit at home getting my kid ready to school and keep cooking? She's a topper from the 2005 batch trainees in the AP Police academy. Moreover, she has attained a black belt in Taekwando. She has left her career for the sake of her husband and yet to be born baby. She is a lioness who's resting at home. If I'm able to fight bloody decoits like you outside, that's because of the courage of having her back home. [groans] Check out what is the condition of your men once. They'd already be in a screwed up state! Hello? Hello Dad! Mom and I are safe! Hey kiddo, I'm sorry for losing my temper on you the other day. No apologies in the family, Dad. Take it easy. -Wait, Mom wants to speak. -Yeah, go ahead! My goddess... Their arrival here in search of us clearly indicates that your success has started. Me and Chikku are coming back home. I'll prepare a strong masala biryani for you. I'm coming! On the way! [chorus singing] "Beautiful lioness, shapely gun" "Naughty eyed girl flying free" "Your hips resemble a fine pistol" "Your dimpled cheeks have the power of bullets" "My duty would be with you at home from now on, Sweetie!" "My dear classy Kalyani, serve me masala biryani" "Biryani... biryani..." "Oh my hot-headed prince, get the family pack for yourself" "Get it for yourself... get it for yourself" "Your macho ways would make way for your victory" "My fitness compliments your aggression" "I would stay beside you as a competition to your skills" "I'll march a parade in your kitchen" "Embrace me to make-up for the longing" "My dear classy Kalyani, serve me masala biryani" "Biryani... biryani..." "Oh my hot-headed prince, get the family pack for yourself" "Get it for yourself... get it for yourself" [chorus singing] "-The handcuffs are ready. -Let's wear them together." "-There should be a prison. -My girl's embrace does the job." "-The man is on fire! -The lady is ready too!" "You always right like a siren..." "...in the heart of your girl" "You always stay close to me..." "...like my uniform" "Give me security for my beauty today" "You got to stay on rounds like the moon this entire night" "I'll give you a hell lot of kisses with love" "My dear classy Kalyani, serve me masala biryani" "Biryani... biryani..." "Oh my hot-headed prince, get the family pack for yourself" "Get it for yourself... get it for yourself" [chorus singing] Take him into custody. -So, you are back on the job. -Sir. You locked him behind the bars for three days just for one FIR. Now you have a bunch. Every police station in this district will be under you. Every police man will be in your control. I am giving you 48 hours of time. Only one name either yours or Katari Krishna's should be heard in Ongole. -Yes, sir. -Best of luck. What have you guys done this time? -Ah? -We robbed bedsheets from DSP's house. -Hey, Gulabi! -Ah? Who told you that Ongole's bull was stolen by Brazilians? -Who is it? -Look there. Hey, no one can stop a batsman in form and a policeman in uniform. -Now Katari gets his share. -Of course. [gun shot] [gun shots] [gun shots] His total gang is finished, sir. I heard the sound, what next? SP... Krishna, nothing is in my hand now. Your SP has included my name in your file and sent it to officials. I will be at risk. Don't call me hereafter. Don't trouble me in just this case brother, I beg you. See you. Good riddance. Hey! These idiots should be drowned in the Gundlakamma river! No matter how many phone calls you make, this is what you get. Listen to me, let's flee the town and go to some other place. At least we will stay alive. Hey, I will move anywhere, only after seeing his death. What will you watch? He shot all your men like birds, leaving no one for you. I don't need a man, I'm fine with a husband. [metal clinks] When you don't accept me as a man even after being with me for 25 years, how would the village agree? Potha Raju Veera Shankar! Ankadu, I have killed 25 people with this hand. I didn't get any satisfaction in any killing. But I will get it now, with his death. He will come, for sure he will come here searching for me. Let him come. Will shall chase and hunt him down with sickles. Let that idiot come. -Balaji. -Sir? Where is this light house located? Sir, this is Vetalpalem. Vetapalem. Don't leave even one house unchecked! Ask every single person. -They'll be at She-oak plantation. -She-oak plantation? Yes, sir. Casuarina plantation at the beach. [weapon swishing] [shot fired] [shot fired] [shot fired] Hey! [gun cocking] [clicking tongue] Ah! You've cleverly escaped in the truck, brother. Then, how come you have ended up here? Because of this nail! [tyres screeching] [groans in pain] No, please don't kill me... don't kill me. What? Didn't you challenge that you'd behead me and hang my head at the Addanki Bus Stand? Didn't you warn me that you suck my blood? You have constantly blabbered about background, what happened to that now? What background is left with you now? You've killed Jayamma who has put all her faith in you, and your wife as well. You have distanced your daughter. Do you have anyone left who would care for you? Your bloody life is of no use now. But I should mention something in the records, Kitty. If you shoot yourself with this, it will be a suicide. If I shoot you, it would be called as encounter. The decision is yours. I'll surrender. It just takes a second for him to kill me. But he gave me the chance to reform. Once upon a time, I used to think about who I should kill when I come out of jail. Those days are changed now. I have my daughter to serve me food when I come out and my granddaughter, to play with. There is a meaning for my life now. He changed me, man. He has changed me completely. I got it. I completely understood about him now. Leave that to me now. I will take care. Hmm... Hey, bro... I am the one who changed, not him. He is the same hot-headed person. If you utter the word background, he would lose his mind. So be careful. Argh! Should you warn me several times, brother? I've told you that I will take care, haven't I? -I'm Konda Reddy! -We will see that. It's been an hour. Where is your CI sir? He is coming. Sir, I am Konda Reddy. Hmm... Are you that idiot? -Yes. -She is a little girl. How can you set dogs on her? -Don't you have any sense? -Sir... Sir... I have committed a mistake, sir. That is why I am here to surrender. Huh! She hails from a small family that makes a living out of toil. How did you even think they can afford her treatment? It doesn't matter how much the treatment would cost. I will take her to the best doctor, best hospital in the city. I will pour my life into her. [phone ringing] Sir, one minute. -Hello? -I am MP Subba Reddy speaking. Who is it... who took you to the police station? Didn't you tell him about our background? Brother, I beg you. I'm in the middle of something. I will call you later. Hang up. I hung up. She will miss her school for 6 months. What about her education? I will take care, sir. I will take care of her education as long as she studies. If she wants to become a doctor or an engineer... ...or maybe both if she wants to. [phone ringing] -Who is this? -I am MLA Venkat Reddy speaking. Don't you even have my number with you? I couldn't see because my eyes are blurred. That's my situation. Don't you worry! I am coming with 50 men to the police station. Let us show who we are and what our background is. [gasps] You don't need to show anything. You take care of yours and I will take care of mine. Hang up. That was a real estate agent. Whatever you said should be in the written form. -Sir... -And that should bear your signature. [phone ringing] Oh no! The brother-in-law. Get the bond papers ready and call her parents too. [phone ringing] Put your phone in silent mode when you are inside the police station. [phone ringing] Tell me where should I sign. I'll do it. I should prepare it first. Let me put my signatures first. You can write whatever you want later. -Brother-in-law! -[gasps] Why aren't you answering my calls since long? Who is that? Who the hell has brought you here? He should know our background! -Hey, stop it, man! -What now? -Did he nab you knowing our background? -No! Who are you? [gasps] Hey, Konda Reddy, is it you? Hmm... I told you very clearly. But how come you bounced back here? -I did everything as you said, brother. -Okay. When everything was going smooth, he arrived here like a telegram that arrives into the first night room. He uttered the absolute forbidden word. All the compromises and assurances were gone. He reopened all the old cases along with the dogs-case and has beaten the hell out of me! What is the actual case that he filed to put you in? I'll tell you, brother. Give me a minute. You got trapped by the nail and I got trapped by the mango. Come on. [Krishna laughing] A mango? Well... will you drink tea? Yes, brother. -Yes, I will. -We both will have it. Hey, brother. Three cups of tea. Fifty! Fifty! Fifty! Fifty... -Fifty rupees! -Hey, what's with your squeezing? You seem to be a bit odd? Are you new here? Yes, I came here by getting transferred from Tihar jail. What's with you? Prisoners seek transfer to big jail from smaller one for better facilities. -Yeah! -But why have you come here from there? Tihar jail is highly secured. It's very difficult to escape from that jail. But here, it is easy. What is it you plan to do so urgently by escaping from here? I have a guy to kill. Who is he? -CI Shankar. -Ah? [all laughing] Pothu Raju Veera Shankar. [all laughing] Fifty! [all laughing heartily] We've been thinking that we are the dumbest. But this guy tops us! You got it, right? This is it! Our lives are can turn in any direction. Anything can be changed and any person can be reformed. And that's why, let's stay happily. Meet you later! See you!
