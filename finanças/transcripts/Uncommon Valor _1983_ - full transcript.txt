Wait a minute, he ain't dead. He ain't dead, damn it. Let's go. Let's go... - Frank! - Get up. Come on, frank. Jesus. Let's get outta here. Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Hey, come back. Come back, goddamn it. Don't leave! But on this joyous day, one sobering question, one haunting question remains. Are they all back? Still listed as "missing in action" are 2,500 American men. Are any of them still being held prisoner? For the families of those men, the vietnamese war will never be over until that question is answered. We're waiting for the first pow to emerge from the plane, all of America waiting, and in particular his family is waiting. We'll be seeing these heroes emerging momentarily. We're waiting now for... On this momentous day, the end of the war officially for them, this day, march 7th 1973. The first one coming off now. He looks a little thin, but considering what he's been through, he looks fine. I'm sure he looks even better to his family, he's approaching them now. We're waiting now for others to be coming off. And there's the official reunion, the war is over for him. For other American families, the agonizing will continue till they find out the fate of their missing sons. Daddy. Daddy. I'm scared. Can I sleep with you tonight? Colonel rhodes, I sympathize, but what can we do? I don't want sympathy, I want help finding my son. - There's nothing I can do. - Look. There are 2,500 men unaccounted for. We've had 400 sightings of Americans held captive. I've heard the numbers. I've told you, I can't do anything. That's all I ever heard in Washington. Nobody could do anything. That's why I came here. You didn't hear this from me, but there are men in Bangkok who claim they've seen pows in Laos. I suggest I put you in contact with them. I think my son is being held in Laos. But I need proof. Get my son's signature on the back of this picture. Get my son to write his name on that, all right? If I get your son's name here, I want lots of money. Yeah, ok. Hey, you. You take look. Yes. No. Ok. Hey. Oh boy, there's that old colonel Mia again. - Senator. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine. - Nice to see you. - And you. Sorry I've no time today. But call my office, I'll be happy to talk to you. - Thank you. - I'm sorry. I'm glad you could come. I can't help with your son. I must find food for these new refugees. Go talk to that guy, he'll help you. - Good luck. - Thank you very much. That's your boy. He's a prisoner in a camp in Laos. I smuggled it out. I know my son's being held in northern Laos, but I need to know where. I need a thorough recon of the area. That's tough, but I can go into Laos. Hell, I can go into north Vietnam. I've been there before, I've got the connections. But it takes a lot of money. - Don. - How are you, Jason? Good. What do you have for me? If they find out about this, they'll retire me like they retired you. Yeah, ok. I suppose someone could call this treason. No, thanks. It's a prison camp in Laos. Look at the paddy dykes. There's your proof, Jason. There's your proof, one, one, one. Now go get your boy. All right, now where was 1? Blaster, tell us about the time that big wave at sunset nearly got you. Come on, I must've told you that story a thousand times. - I don't remember how I lied last time. - It doesn't matter, it's still bitchin'. All right, all right. As you know, the surf on the north shore comes up real fast. You're out there, having a good time, then it happens. A life-threatening experience. - And then? - Yeah, what happened? This photo was taken somewhere near where frank is being held. I'm not saying frank is one of them, but those two are Americans. They're tall. The average vietnamese man is about 5 ft. 215. - They are Americans. - And that's supposed to be frank? That is frank. I've bought too many fakes over the last ten years. That definitely is frank. - He's spent ten years in that shithole? - Listen, frank is alive, Stanley. You got that? My son is alive. Look at this. That's a high-altitude photo taken from an sr-71. Look at that closely. See, right here in the paddy dykes. The three lines there. One, one, one. That's your old lrrp team designation. First battalion, eleventh infantry, recon team Arizona, see? - Plain as day. - Here? Right there, yes. Mr. rhodes, that's three lines in the ground, it could be anything. You know it isn't though, don't you? That's a message from my son. You know that. Hello. Hi. - Mrs. wilkes? - Yeah, that's right. I'm Jason rhodes, I phoned this morning. I know who you are. Listen, my husband doesn't want to talk to you. - I phoned this morning, he said he did. - Not any more. Why don't you just do me a favor and go away? - Not till I see your husband. - You have got no right to be here. It's taken me ten years to get that war out of his head. Looks like it's still in his head. Oh, that's very deep. Where were you all the days he just sat and stared at the walls? - Hey, wilkes. - Goddamn youl! Why send your wife? Don't you have the guts to talk to me? Leave him alone. My son needs you. At least have the decency to look at our photos and hear us out. - Please don't. - Wilkesy. I'll handle this now. I don't like your tactics. - But I'll listen because of frank. - Ok. - Blaster. - Wilkesy. - Why didn't you stay in touch, man? - I don't know. Why didn't you? I don't know. It's weird, ain't it? How'd they find you? I don't know. Came looking for me and found me. And we found you. - Thanks a lot, blaster. - It's good to see you, man. There are compounds all over northern Laos. There are choppers we left behind. We'll use them to get into the camp. They're used all the time, so they should be fairly well maintained... Excuse me, please. You going out? - It's a little early, isn't it? - Well, I want to make happy hour. You wanna come along? - No, I think I'll stay home tonight. - No kidding. - What the hell does that mean? - It means no kidding. - I just don't feel like going out. - You never do. - Please, sit. He never feels like it. - That's not true. Every night he just looks through his telescope and listens to that crap. That "crap" is George gershwin. Whatever. It's like I'm not even here. It's like nothing's here. He's like a little turtle, hiding in his shell. Look at him. He hasn't taken off those sunglasses in six years. I don't believe... I've given up trying to figure him out. Maybe you should take him back to Vietnam. He sure as hell doesn't give a damn about anything here. - It was very nice meeting you, colonel. - Nice meeting you. If he did go, how much would he be paid? Nothing in dollars. I haven't flown a helicopter in a long time. I'd probably get somebody killed. There's a lot of unfinished business over there, major Johnson. Not mine. Is this the distinguished flying cross? - Yeah. - How'd you get that? - Pulling a thud pilot out of Laos. - There must've been more to it. Not really. Tell me about it, I'd like to hear it. I got him out after a lot of good people went down trying. It was a hell of a day. We'd already lost a real good man named Hendricks. A couple of f-4 jocks, even Sandy lolitte. - I lost a lot of good friends. - How many? I don't remember. It just seemed like everybody. You lost eleven men and nine aircraft. You were shot down and volunteered to go back. Why? - If you know all that, you tell me. - Why? - It was my job. - Why? We had to. We couldn't let good men die for nothing. That's exactly why we're going back now. Wait a minute. Back up. You can't lay that kind of guilt on me. I'm sorry, but the answer is no. What do you want from me? I run half this hospital, colonel. I lead a good life here. I'm off to Bermuda next week, not off to some fantasy war. I cannot save the goddamn world, colonel. At ease, major. - Macgregor oil. - Mr. macgregor, please. - Mr. macgregor's office. - Is he in? It's Jason rhodes. - Hold the line, please. - Jason, how's it going? - It's on. - How many? - Three. - Only three? A couple said no. One of the chopper pilots. - Can you do it with two? - I'll do it with one if I have to. - I've come too far to turn back now. - Is there any more I can do? Just keep the cash coming. Somehow I'll get our boys back. What about sailor? I've tracked him down in Houston, I'm going there now. By the way, the replica pow camp is finished and ready for you. - Great. - Keep in touch. All right. I'll talk to you. Don't worry, he can't see you. It's a two-way mirror. Your friend sailor blowtorched a local kingpin biker. We're holding him on our witness protection program. Son of a bitch came here with a grenade round his neck. If you ask me, I don't think his bread's quite done. I had trouble tracking you down. You've wandered all over the United States. I know a lot about you from frank's letters. He said you were the best in the unit. Yes? What the hell happened to you? Man, I'm so far beyond that shit now. I eat energy from the air. I talk to polar bears, I converse with paramecium. Man, I fuck nuclear waste. Shit. You guys will be using real grenades and stuff. - They took mine off me. - Look, asshole. This is not some bullshit biker's acid trip. This is a precise military operation. Listen. Frank was the best man in anybody's unit. I've got enough brain cells to remember that. You gotta give me a shot, man. You gotta. Hey, wilkesy. Oh, man. Come on. Sailor? Blaster. - You haven't changed a bit. - Master wilkes, how've you been? - What happened to your grenade? - I used it for an emergency enema. Maybe I do have a little unfinished business. Besides, he wouldn't last ten minutes there without me. Look what happened to me without you. Ok. Get aboard. This is it. An exact replica of the pow camp. - Who built this place? - Macgregor's father. Get your gear, stow it in that big tent. I'll meet you right here in about an hour for supper. Mr. ky, supper in one hour. Thank you. Mr. Scott, at ease. So, who the hell is that? - Good evening. - Hi. - How are you? - Mr. ky, you may serve supper. Thank you. - Good evening. - As you were. Since military courtesy is not practical here, we'll dispense with it. Gentlemen, this is Kevin Scott. He knows the latest weapons and training techniques. And this is Mr. ky. We'll be eating only vietnamese food from now on. We don't want to be tramping through the jungle smelling like Americans. Any questions? - Good. - So, how long were you there? I wasn't. Too young. Is he going with us? He served in force recon marines. Served? I was discharged for striking a radio operator who fell asleep at his post. You're worried that I have no combat experience. You're right. There's no way of proving that I won't fail in combat. But then again, you can't prove that I will, either. This is gonna be a whole lotta fun with this one. Gentlemen. Thank you for coming. I knew you would come, 'cause you men have got what it takes. It's molded over a little, but you've still got it. There's a bond between you men as strong as the bond between my son and me. There's no bond as strong as that of men who've faced death in battle. You men seem to have a strong sense of loyalty, because you're thought of as criminals. Because of vietham. You know why? Because you lost. And in this country, that's like going bankrupt, you're out of business. They want to forget about you. You cost too much, and you didn't turn a profit. That's why they won't go and pick up our buddies, there's no gain in it. You and I know that the books are still in the red. And the politicians know, too. The same politicians that never lost a single son in Vietnam, not one. Now, they say they've been negotiating for ten years. Well, I... The other side's not buying. And while the politicians sit on their asses, I'm going to ask you to lay yours on the line. Again. Because, gentlemen, we're the only hope those pows have. So, we're going back there. And this time... This time, nobody can dispute the rightness of what we're doing. Get down. You're all dead. Not quite, sir. Go, colonel. Go, colonel, go. Go, colonel. Go, go. Move it, move it. Go, baby. Go, go, go, go, go. Fucking pimp. Go, blaster. Blaster, go. Come on baby, go. All right! Ok. Come on, man. Come on, boy. - Come on, sailor, take it home. - You big Turkey. Go, go, sailor, go. - Go, rookie. - All right, come on. - Go, sailor. - All right, hit it. What are you doing? You don't ever quit, boy. Not when it's for real. All right, gentlemen, that's enough. - Oh, shit. - A little too much civilian life. Let's go. - Pull it in. - Oh, shit. Ok, move your butts. Double time. Nice shooting, colonel. Blaster, elbow down. Yeah, yeah. Sailor, stop spraying. Conserve your ammo. - You haven't got one in the kill zone. - These hands were made to fly. Tell that to the enemy when he blows your stupid head off. Kill the enemy. - Hey, don't lose it, mister. - You kill the fucking enemy, asshole. Sailor... - I could teach you a lesson. - Make your best move, boy. Scott. Aword, please. These men are seasoned veterans. They can't be treated like raw recruits. - But sir, they... - You must earn their respect, Kevin. Yes, sir. Wilkesy's claustrophobic as shit. He was the tunnel rat in our unit. He was checking out a tunnel for weapons storage, turns out there's somebody down there. So he knifes them both in the dark. Then the mortar shells hit, and he's stuck there till we dig him out. Wilkes lights a match to see if he can move these two bodies off him. Turns out he knifed some woman and her kid. Killed them deader than shit, man. Jesus. Wilkes starts freaking. We can hear him screaming, but, all he can do is stay there with those two corpses till we dig him out. You come in low, under his line of sight. You leap, taking him down. Put your hand over his nose, pull his face away. At the base of the skull, to the right of the spine, insert and scramble the brains. What you have is instant rag doll. Most human problems can be solved with high explosives. In today's lesson, boys and girls, we'll learn how to set a "series" or "break". Follow me. My personal best is a break of six. We want a linked series of disasters. Figure evasive moves from each blast to plant the next. Just as we were coming up here with the column, they would trip charge number one, an m-26 trip grenade. Boom. Start of action. Column splits in two, half here, half there. Over here to number two, a "Willie Peter", to set their ass on fire. They think they're safe. Boom. Number three, "bouncing Betty", blows their balls off. Number four. They come over here and find a two-pound charge of c4. Boom. Number five, quick fuse grenade. Not a big bang, but it does a good job. Anybody left will be thinking, "we've got to make it now." And they're coming out and they're moving, and then, they run into charge six, the claymore mine. End of story. Congratulations, sailor, you just wasted a prisoner. He was a collaborator. You all right? - Can't sleep, huh? - No. You know, for years I couldn't sleep after Korea. My nightmares all had to do with the chosin reservoir. The ground was frozen, we couldn't dig graves. We had to pile the dead on trucks and lash them against the tanks. For years I'd wake up with those dead, frozen faces staring at me. Did they ever go away? No. I finally made friends with them, though. Left, left, left, left, right, left. No, no, no. Get together... Gentlemen. The object of the next exercise is to get from here to the bridge, without being tagged by wilkes. Shit. Sneaky little shit. Shit. I'm dead. Wilkesy, I'm supposed to... Shit. - Come on. - Quickly. Come on. You can make it. Come across. You people got caught 'cause you got careless. I told you... All right, wilkesy! The object of the exercise was not to get caught. His elevator doesn't go all the way up. Agent orange. No, it's red wine and uppers. That's why we call him sailor. He used to take a lot of red wine and uppers, and just sail away. How come he wears that grenade around his neck? He always said if life got too shit, he'd just pull the pin and see what's next. Wilkesy, remember that song? Get down and boogie, remember? Yeah. Boogie, come on, wilkesy. - Come on, wilkesy. - Hey, blaster. Come on, Johnson, get out here. - Come on, now. Go for it. - Do it, boy. Agent orange. All agent orange. - Ok, Curtis. Follow the leader. - Sounds good to me. Close it up, close it up. I'm here, baby. Come on, let's go fly this thing. Get your Sierra together, my man. Kiss my Sierra, buddy. You used to be the Ace of the base. Did you get too old for this, buddy? Looking good, guys. Looking good. Left, left, left, right, left. Shit. - What the fuck am I doing here? - Come on, don't quit. - Fuck you. - We have to work together. I don't need this mother-fucking shit. I'm here working my ass off, and I don't need some wet-nosed asshole screaming in my face. - Back off. - Mother... We're on the same team. We have to work together. We are the team, asshole. We were there, not you. Now, asshole. Right now. Sailor, colonel rhodes was wrong. I can't earn your respect, 'cause you have no respect for yourself. Boy, you just bought a whole can of whoop-ass. Come on, sailor. Kick his ass, sailor. Boy, using that oriental, martial bullshit on me is gonna get real expensive. - Get up. Come on, hero. - That's enough. - Yeah, he's had enough. - Get up. You can't keep me from this mission. - Why are you getting up? - Stay down. Stay down, you little fucker. - No. - Why do you want to die? Why? I'll tell you why. His father's missing in action. Shot down in Vietnam, that's why. All right, blaster, when I come over the treeline at 03.00, remember that's your cue to blow up the radio tower. Next is the bridge, to cut off reinforcements from the village. Boom. Mr. Scott, that will be your cue to neutralize guard tower a. All right, charts, Johnson, you pick up blaster after we've snatched the prisoners. Major Johnson, you pick up Scott. - Ok, blaster, this is the big ride. - All right, sailor. Gentlemen, I want you to study every inch of this compound. It's an exact reproduction of the pow camp in Laos. Men, it's imperative that we're in and out in under three minutes. Our lives, and the lives of the prisoners, may depend on it. We're gonna rehearse so we can do this operation in our sleep. We must be in and out in three minutes. In ten days' time we'll have a live fire exercise. Look, we've been in diplomatic negotiations for the release of all pows, if there are any. An armed incursion now would undermine those negotiations. Negotiations! It's been 10 years. They'll be dead before you get them out. Harry, as my friend, I want you to call rhodes and drop this project. Look, I didn't want it to get this far. They're prepared to take serious measures against your company. IRS audits, anti-trust suits. Fuck you, art. The men we're going after will be in very bad shape. Something like these. They may not be able to walk. They may not want to walk. They're gonna be shattered, both physically and emotionally. After all these years, they may not speak english. Remember, gentlemen, everything we do tonight is motivated by them. - It looked like the fourth of July. - It was beautiful. It was great. Gentlemen. Mr. macgregor. I wanted to thank you all personally. After watching you work tonight, I know Jason chose the right men. Hear, hear. One more thing, a little token of my esteem. A check and some pocket money for Bangkok. - Please. - Take it. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - It's only money. Thank you. Do you ever regret letting frank go, Jason? No, he was already in the service. You had contacts. Couldn't you get him stationed elsewhere? No, where there's a war, the rhodes fight it. We lost almost a whole family at gettysburg in one day. We're no good at anything else. We haven't always been real good at the fighting, either. A lot of us have been killed. But we're always there. You know, Jason, I'd give everything I have, everything, for just one hour with him. See if that's our truck. He's a CIA man for sure. Johnson, rhodes. You're in a shit pile of trouble. We're confiscating your weapons. My orders are to put you in jail, a Bangkok jail. I don't want to put an old soldier like you in jail. But damn it, this scheme of yours is crazy. Shit. You'd best be on the next plane home. Don't go to the hotel, they're waiting for you. Since our government has confiscated our weapons, I won't ask you to go on. It's over. I'm not giving up, those bastards. My son frank is waiting for me. I'll never give up. I'll go in with a penknife if I have to. You people do whatever you want to, ok? - We must be able to buy guns here. - No, but we can up north. - What about money? - The CIA will get you. Who cares? It's a total wipe-out. We've got money. That's right, the money macgregor gave us. Everybody give it up. - All of it, sailor. - That's all I got. - What have you been doing? - Seeing the sights. Wilkes, we'll need transportation. - Four-wheel drive? - Preferably. - Buy it or borrow it? - Steal the fucker. Left. Hey. Seems someone has taken over your man's drug operation. They even took his house. He's down the street. - Colonel rhodes, sit down. - Mr. Jiang, how are you? I understand you've had some trouble. Such are the misfortunes of the narcotics world. I barely escaped with my life. Nothing else. I need some men to take us into Laos. Colonel rhodes, I will take you myself. - I'm weary of this life of uselessness. - Jiang, we need weapons. We need cheap weapons, now. We lost ours in Bangkok, you understand? - No, we don't have time to eat. - Monsieur. I'll bet you find our cuisine to your approval. At this restaurant you can eat well or poorly, depending on how you order your meal. - What do you recommend? - All our cuisine is exceptional. But there are seasonal specialties. Five thousand dollars. Four thousand dollars. Three thousand dollars. These dishes require twenty-four hour notice. Monsieur, these entrées are all too rich for our blood. Come on. Brother bond! Sorry, the wrong department. - The bargain basement's this way. - How much for the beer? Compliments of the house. Yes. I'll give you the whole lot for... No, six thousand dollars. - Let's say four thousand dollars. - You're cheap. Garbage. - Thank you. - High and to the right. High and to the right. High and to the right. Hit. Hit. Hit. Gentlemen. These are my daughters. They will accompany us into Laos. Unfortunately, I have no sons to offer you. They were killed by Laotian red guards during opium run. However, I am certain my daughters will prove themselves worthy. Stan, watch this case for me. All right. Yeah, that one. Ok, let's go, gentlemen. We're back. I'm just trying to stay warm. I swear to god. Jiang. - What happened here? - Ypres. - What? - Ypres. - Ypres. - What's he talking about, Johnson? It's French. A town in France. First place the Germans used mustard gas. Oh, yeah. - Yellow rain. - Mung people fight viethamese. Vietnamese hate them. - Laotian border patrol. - Get the recaoilless rifle, right now. He thinks we're opium dealers. - They want our cargo. - Offer a bribe. Stall him. They want to inspect our packs. Guys, this will get terminal fast. - Ready, Johnson? - Ready. Go. Scott, goddamn it. Man your weapon. Damn it, two of them got away. Colonel... Sir, we lost one rpg, six grenades, and one of the radios is damaged. It'll receive, but the transmitter's completely shot. Mr. Jiang. - We'd... - Come. We must continue on. No further words are necessary, colonel rhodes. As we don't have night-vision gear, we'll change to schedule b: 06.00 instead of 03.00. We'll still be able to receive your verification about the pows. But you'll have to assume we have the choppers. Wait till you hear us coming. Ground team, you're up that trail. Well, that's it. It's game time. I had a speech prepared, but I guess I forgot to... There are some lines from Julius Caesar. "If a man were to know the end of this day's business ere it come. "But it suffices that the day will end, and then the end be known. "And if we meet again, well then we'll smile. "And if not, then this parting was well made." It should be right over that hill. Come on, quietly. Down. Drop your packs. It looks deserted. Do you think they moved them? Quite possible. Rice down there has been harvested. - I'll take a look. - Me too. I must inspect the bridge. No way in. There's a wall all around. Wilkesy, come and look at this. What? - Ok, wilkesy, I'll go. - No. Look, I'll be waiting for you when you come out. Ok, wilkesy? Here, take this. It'll help protect you. Help. Wilkesy, you all right? Wilkesy, what's wrong, man? - It's ok, man, it's not poisonous. - Yeah. I told you that charm would take care of you, man. I don't believe it, the chopper compound isn't here. It should be here. They must've moved the damn thing. Give me the map. - Cover. - Get down. All right, let's go. Come on, let's move. Laotian regulars. Prisoners. They were working on the barracks side of the river, out of sight. Jesus, wilkes. - He saw me. - You almost got me seen. - I saw one of our guys. - I saw three. Alcatraz, this is sing sing. Bmx, we've struck oil. I repeat, we've struck oil. Hold it. They're there. The pows are there. Jesus Christ, they're there! Ok. Ok. Let's find those choppers. I don't know. It could've been frank, I just don't know. We will know soon enough. I've got some nocturnal planting to do. Scott, good luck. Jiang. Wilkesy, let's go. Colonel, we have to move a lot faster. There's a lot of jungle between that base and us. Come on. Where is that son of a bitch? I know it came down in this area. We'd better hurry, dawn is in two hours. All right. They're asleep. Let's go get them before they wake up. Charts. You and sailor take the barracks. I'll take the officers' quarters. But, sir, Mr. charts must fly the helicopter. He cannot risk injury. I will go in first, with Mr. sailor. - Charts? - Ok. They should be on their way by now. Hup, hup. All right, get out. Move, let's go. Get your hands up. Charts. Charts, get the gunship. Johnson, in the huey. All right, hold them right here, sailor. Lai fun, stay with sailor. Shit. Battery. Smoke on the Ridge. I'll cover. Johnson's chopper took another hit. All right, spot for me. I've got a guy. Two hundred meters, top of the Ridge, left of the tree. Right, two meters. - Got him. - All right. Baby. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, sailor. Charts. Lai fun! Ok, fucker. Ok, you're history, pal. - Charts, are you with me? - I'm right behind you. - Johnson, are you with me? - I'm right on you. Shit, where are they? - You cannot let them cross the bridge. - What if they don't show? They are coming. You must not let them cross. Fire in front of them. Fire. You ain't crossing that fucking bridge. It's still there. Goddamn caps. Come on, you bastards. Come and get it. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Come on, a new record. Seven, yes. Eight. Unbelievable. Come on, we can get them out. Oh, my god. Damn it. - Coming in on the tower. - Right, boss. Son of a bitch. We've been hit. Hold on. The gun's jammed, colonel. I'm gonna take out the tower. Hold on. Ok, boss. We're gonna hit heavy. - Colonel? - Wilkes, give me a hand. Jesus Christ. - Colonel, are you all right? - Yeah. We saw four Americans. Sailor, there's one in there. - All right. - Go, go, go. Frank. Come on, buddy. We're going home. I can't. The garden. It's ok, partner, we'll take the garden with us. Come on, it's gonna be ok. Let's go. Hurry, boss. Frank. It's ok, soldier. It's all right. - Come on, let's go. - Home? Home for real? - Yeah. - For real? Are there any more rounds for the recoilless? Jiang? I'll kill you, you motherfuckers. Charts, this way. Move it. Come on, man. Charts, go, go. I've checked the cells. No sign of number four. Where's the other American? What? What's he saying? In the pit. - Where's the pit? - Underneath the tower. - Johnson. - Yo. - Give me a count of sixty, then go. - No. We can't leave anyone behind. You'd better leave by sixty, or everyone gets left behind. Frank. Macgregor? Wilkes, cover me. Run, colonel, run. Run. - Let's head for the chopper. - We'll be wiped out. Come on. Goddamn it. Charts, come on. Leave it. Let it go, come on. - Where's sailor? - He's bought it. - What? - He's dead. Sailor! Sailor! Come on, man. Come on. Where's blaster? Goddamn it. Mr. charts. - Come, run. Quickly, this way. - Charts, come on. Let's go. Mayday! Mayday! American Mias on board. Mayday! Mayday! Charts, give me a hand. I've got a heavy stick. Mayday! American Mias on board. Oh, god. It's really good to see you. Frank... He got sick. So sick. We tried to help him. He died. He saved my life that day. He saved my life.
