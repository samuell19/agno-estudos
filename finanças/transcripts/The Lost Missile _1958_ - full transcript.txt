To the Department of Defense and the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the United States, without whose cooperation this film could not have been made, the producers of THE LOST MISSILE express their appreciation. Save the Earth! The world is just a minute away.... from the start of a hydrogen war. At 12:01 a.m. in northern Europe, a blazing, unidentified... a missile-like object appears... on a television screen to search the sky. Origin unknown. Countdown for their fighter missile. This rocket is designed to track, find, destroy. The terrible object was diverted into orbit by the explosion. It hurtles along the Earth's north curve... at an altitude of only 8 km. A crazed missile hovered over the surface of the Earth, inflaming a stretch wide 8 km. below it. It is morning in New York City, a busy spring morning. In the suburbs of New York is located... you will find the great laboratory Havenbrook atomic laboratory. Here are conducted the best military research, an atomic accelerator of five billion volts... is the heart of Havenbrook. This is Jove, a rocket solid-fuel rocket... built to carry a hydrogen warhead. The world's most powerful weapon. Jove is not yet finished. The final checks on the warhead have yet to be done. The man in charge of the warhead, David Loring. His assistant, Joan Wood. This is their wedding day. Oh honey, Jove is almost finished. Wouldn't you rather wait? I'd rather have a wedding than A lunch every day. Lunchtime is not very romantic. David, every time we set a date, a new project comes along. Before there were nuclear carriers... Then we had to perfect the new metal for Jove's third stage. Now a hydrogen warhead. You know how important that is. Yes, I do. But so are we. Oh David. We couldn't stop thinking about all this... just for a little while? It amazes me how a girl so used to facts in her work can't get used to them in her personal life. Look at us. We fall in love over coffee at midnight, we work 12 hours a day, seven days a week. David. I meant it when I said that either we get married today or we don't get married at all. Well, fortunately we have cars... That do some work here. Do you have the data on the header, David? Of course I do. Listen, guys, I hate to do this to you, but I can't leave right now. Oh. How can we get married Without a best man? We'll be back in an hour. We will serve sandwiches on the way back. The Pentagon's big trombones ... are inside with the chief right now. Where are the calculations, David? They're right here. You'll have to illustrate them yourself, Joan has not yet had time to report, they just came out of the computer, and we're getting out of here right now. Good luck, guys. Thank you, Joe. Oh, by the way, Jove's third stage was completed this morning. I don't like the look Of Joe, does he never sleep? They press him too much... maybe when his son is born he will take a vacation. Come, let's hurry. The command to launch of missiles is stopped. The report of maximum computer urgency... indicates that the object did not come from from any American base, but its origin is still unknown. Crazed missile makes boiling the Bering Sea and heads toward the North American continent. Air Defense Command Continental, called CONAD. This is the center of the security and defense... of the United States against air or space attacks. The eyes of the continental defense American are radar eyes. They search for 1600 km. or more, from the towers of Texas... anchored in the Atlantic, from radar planes on patrolling in the Pacific, by patrol ships on continuous service. The farthest outpost than the eyes of CONAD... are the radar stations in Canada's Northern Canada called the DEW Line, Far First Alert Line. Man, it's as cold as ever out there. How's it going? Oh, it's quiet. Oh. Hey, what the hell is this? Scandinavian flight Airlines 576, right? If that's flight 576, it's off course by 90 degrees. You'd better call the air patrol plane to check it out. Keyhole Advance calling Spyglass 7. Answer Spyglass 7. Spyglass 7 to Keyhole Advance, respond. You have a UFO at 90 degrees West on your course. Investigate. This is not a flight on Scandinavian Airlines. What do you mean? This thing is traveling at 6,400 kilometers per hour. 6.400? Call Spyglass 7, have it frame it on its camera. Keyhole Advance to Spyglass 7... transmit the UFO on your camera, over. Spyglass 7 here. Transmitter ready. Get the camera. CONAD will want some pictures of this. They are online with the camera. The sky is getting bright. It has it on an intercept course. Get that picture now! Come in, Spyglass 7. Answer. I repeat, respond! Transmit that picture to CONAD and hurry up. Yes, sir. Red Bull to CONAD, UFO 640 km. from the DEW Line, Keyhole Advance, latitude 64 degrees, 22 minutes. Longitude 148 degrees in 15 minutes. Altitude, less than 8 km. Speed, over 6,400 km. per hour. Repeat, over 6,400 km. per hour. The image will be transmitted immediately. It is only six minutes away. We could have it resized for you... in less than two hours. David, do you like it? Very nice. There's another one here that I like. Honey, for God's sake, get one the right size, it's not very important. Not very important? Honey. I didn't mean what it sounds like. David, I don't seem to understand you. What is so important at the laboratory... that we can't take a few extra minutes more and go to another store.... And find a suitable ring? There really isn't anything as important as your work, is there? Believe me, you are as important to me As important as my work. David, you won. We are not getting married today. All right, if you say so, but we have to also go back to work. Don't you even care? Of course I care. And you're a scientist, too. Yes, and I'm also a woman. You are misinterpreting everything what I say. Am I? We decided to skip lunch and get married, good. But all you can think about Is a hydrogen warhead. Well, I'm tired of that. Maybe I expected you to insist. To drag me to church, not back to the lab. Well, marry your hydrogen warhead. But I'm quitting my job, David. You'll have to find someone else someone else for both marriages. I'll take the ring. She looked a little angry. Yes, she certainly was. At CONAD, the reports from the DEW Line... have priority over everything else. Sir, there is a confirmed report of a UFO with the characteristics of a missile. Contact the Canadian defense command. Put me through to the Canadian defense command. There is a confirmed report of a UFO with the characteristics of a guided missile.. To the jets of the Royal Canadian Air Force... is ordered in the sky to intercept it. The fighters did not intercepted the rockets... from the defense of London in World War II. The rocket is only five miles away..., but these aviators do not know its million-degree heat. Do you have any other calculations? Yes sir, speed 6,500 km. per hour, altitude altitude 39,000, course unchanged. Picture coming up, sir. The UFO is definitely a missile. The picture is coming to you. There is more. I hope you can stop it. I guess there's about about two minutes. Get me Keyhole Advance. Course unchanged. Speed remains stable, 6,500 km/h. Keyhole Advance not responding, sir. Thank God there was a Keyhole Advance. Expected course over Great Slave Lake, west coast of Hudson Bay, beyond Ottawa, Ottawa, latitude 38 degrees, longitude 75 degrees, directly on the subway New York City. The CONAD at the Pentagon. The joint chiefs of staff are called to an emergency meeting. The first responsibility of these men... is 175 million American lives. They also have a second responsibility, advising the president in case of war. Pentagon puts all yellow all U.S. forces and prepare for red alert. David? Dave. What is it, Joe? It's just been opened the direct line to the Pentagon. Fiery, yellow alert. Is it known why? Why? Who knows why or for what. Your section needs to keep an open line... With the joint chiefs of staff. There are about 10 sections in that lab open on this-- What do you have? Joan. Oh, I forgot, congratulations. Where's the bride? She decided I was in love With a hydrogen warhead, not a woman. No wedding, no lunch. Don't you understand? Doesn't he know that we are on a boat headed for Niagara Falls. And that you are trying to stop us? He does. But she doesn't want to believe it. Who does? Joan, what happened? The honeymoon express has been derailed, Joe. I heard. What, again? anti-aircraft drills again? Maybe not. This is the dive alert of the nuclear reactor. It must be a drill. I have to get to my station. Joan. Let me say something about David. It's work, we're all caught up. We don't have another life, maybe we don't want another life, I don't know. Oh, listen to me. My wife is having a baby, it's supposed to be born today, I should be by her side. I think they can't do without without me for a day, well, can't they? It's crazy. I don't know anymore whether I should be... With my wife or my job. Go home, Joe. Ella needs you. Listen to this siren. And I don't think it's a drill. Joe has never seen this robe. I would wear it only afterwards. Where is Joe? He should be here by now. Oh, don't worry about Joe, mom, he's always on time. He'll come. He will take me to the hospital and ... Oh dear. Sit down, dear. Five minutes late. I just hope you're not held up in traffic. I'll call Havenbrook to find out what time he left. I'm afraid there aren't many minutes left. David. Is it war? I don't know. We have been alerted to submerge the nuclear reactor.... on two minutes' notice And I have to disassemble... Jove's warhead. There are two things at Havenbrook... that could wipe out 10 miles. square of New York City. The nuclear reactor and the warhead of this missile. It is a safety precaution. Safety precaution? Against what? Against being hit By something. I'm going into the room Of the warheads. Please stay on the phone. David. I'm sorry I acted like that. I know how much time is left and I can't I can't even phone her. But Joe, you have to reach her. She's waiting for the car to take her to the hospital. She doesn't trust herself to let take anyone else there. And the place has been closed. Who would have ever thought that such a thing... could happen on a day like this? Nothing goes in or out from Havenbrook, and no phone calls. Let me try. This is a call priority, Joan Wood, section X27. David Loring's assistant. I've been trying. The generals called me Mr. Freed, but I couldn't to get over it. Dr. Freed's wife is supposed to have the baby today. She is expecting her husband. Anne? Anne. Look, I know it's a violation, but, well... Dr. Freed's wife is due to give birth today. I explained, it didn't help. Joe? Good girl. Okay. - Ella? - Uh Huh. Oh, Ella? Oh honey, please hurry up. Tell your mother... Ella. Ella, can you hear me? Joe? Joe. I was talking to... Hello! Yes, this is Joe Freed. Yes, sir. Mom, the line went dead. I thought you were with Ella. The building has been closed. I got a call urgent to come here, what is it? I don't know, I got a call from the Lab, something big. Gentlemen, these are seconds of absolute urgency. This is a Scrambler of the second tier... an object that is now over Canada bound for New York City. This photograph was taken five minutes ago. Speed: 6,700 kilometers per hour. Altitude: just under 5 miles. But it should burn! It doesn't. It looks atomic, a hydrogen engine. We think it is hydrogen. Which would mean a temperature of more than a million degrees. That is impossible. A high-order magnetic field can be projected... by such a missile, without any damage.... to itself resulting from heat. At this time, groups on every rocket... and atomic installations are looking at this image. From this combined knowledge we will recommend to the president... our hypotheses. Our information is that the Soviet prototypes are very different. I have not seen before this design development. Nothing like ours. Any contradictions? Mr. President. Havenbrook's staff is not able to identify the project. You men will be evacuated immediately. We cannot afford to lose you. This rocket will pass over New York in 63 minutes, destroying it. The war today means two things: immediate defense, immediate retaliation. A war can last only one hour. In that hour, 30 million people could be killed. The SAC, Strategic Air Command. The most powerful aircraft in the world, with bases in England, Spain, North Africa, Greenland, the United States. Seven minutes from the first flash from CONAD. After Pearl Harbor, it took us months to prepare for war. By missile attack. we have only a few minutes. There may be no tomorrow. There may not be this afternoon either. Eight minutes now since the first alarm. Hundreds of radar stations around the earth's curve... they are looking for additional flying objects. Contacts are being made with all foreign powers... to identify the source of the deranged missile. Ladies and gentlemen, the press conference... of the secretary of state's today has been canceled. No, no questions, please. I'm sorry. Thank you very much for coming, but no questions. John. I said no questions, Young. I'm going on the air in 15 minutes. 30 million people are look at me, and what do I tell them? No comment. I asked the president to wait 15 minutes.... until such time as the received responses from other nations. Any reports on additional missiles? No, Mr. Secretary. Any reports from the CIA on sudden military activities... by European nations or Asian ones? No, Mr. Secretary. A missile over Alaska. And I have to give the president the recommendation... of the State Department On immediate retaliatory action. What is the danger? What, that's what I want to know. I said no comment! I will tell the whole country.... That 10 million people are going to die. If you use just one word of those you just named, just one word, I can promise you that you will not stay in Washington. These are from London And Pei Ping, sir, received four minutes ago. We are still verifying Paris and Tokyo, you should have them in three minutes. H mm. Well, the foreign ministries deny any hostile action. All of them deny any knowledge of the ufo now over Canada. What about Russia? District Scrambler to the ambassador in Moscow. Yes? Yes, Mr. President. It's the president, sir. Yes, Mr. President. I am waiting to hear from our ambassador in Moscow, Mr. President. I will inform our ambassador, Mr. President. The presidency of the Soviet Union... has just telephoned to the president. The origin of the giant missile is unknown. Sir, are you all right? Yes. I was just praying. Praying that these are honest men. These Canadian jets move at 1,900 km. per hour. Go ahead, Watcher Wind, this is the team leader. Ottawa, capital of Canada. 200,000 people go about their daily activities. Her parliament is in session, here children are in school. Ottawa is on yellow alert. Federal Civil Defense, Washington, DC. The warning is being sent to agencies... of civil defense of the east coast. Prepare for total disaster. The east coast is in warning yellow. New York is being warned. Starting Plan A of the civil defense, Firefighters are alerted, the traffic goes under control, Hospitals prepare, the evacuation of the city begins. Joe, what are you doing at home? There is not much time, fill the tub and the sink, and every pot you have with water, and if you hear a siren, turn off the power of the house with the main switch. Yes, Millie. I don't know what this is all about, but maybe we'd better better hurry to the supermarket. Goodbye Millie. And stay off the phone, no calls, no loading at the supermarket. Stay in the house and keep the radio on. Yes, Jimmy. Why did you call me, you know. I always sleep late. What? No! Yes! Yes dear. Oh yes, right away, what's going on? Steven, go get Jenny And hurry! - Why? - Don't ask why. - Yes but... - Not yes but, just go! The La Guardia airport is shutting down all its aviation activities... commercial and private. La Guardia Control Tower to all aircraft: All incoming flights are redirected to Philadelphia. Tower La Guardia to all planes... All flights are temporarily canceled. All flights are temporarily cancelled. Civil protection measures have priority... throughout the city. These men began a normal day's work. They are no longer employees of the demolition company. They are soldiers and officers of the civil defense. Theirs is the most important job of all at this time. The blood banks of the Red Cross have been informed that.. the surrounding area of New York City will need... of approximately two million gallons of blood. Here is the great bandit. I've never seen anything like this On the radar before. Here is the green line. A UFO that looks like The lost missile... has appeared on the station's radar of the station. Canadian jets are within 400 km. from the intercept. Don't forget to catch these, darling. Car number three is ready, sir, but there is no room for Miss Wood. Then there is no room for me either. Go ahead, Dr. Loring. I'm staying right here. David, even Joe Freed on the day... on which his son might be born has no choice. Joe Freed's baby. General Barr! We can use Jove. - Jove is not ready. - Except for the warhead, Jove is ready! It might take 10 days, we have less than an hour. I can assemble it in 20 minutes and reach the base in another 20. - David, get in the car. - Sir, I can use a baby header. - A baby warhead? - Just use the atom fuse trigger. It is the only missile that can overcome that heat so fast... And at least give us a chance With an atomic blast! David, there is a chance. You take these, I'll stay here. You are right, Jove can look it up... with his driving device at 5,000 miles per hour. Canadian jets are two minutes from interception. 90 seconds to intercept. They are 30 miles away. They are gone! He incinerated them from the sky! Negative report. Negative report! There is no radar of Canadian jets! The banned missile continues on its previous course. What do the computers say? - Predicted trajectory and course-- - Show them on the map, please. On the map. It took a course through northern Canada, past Great Slave Lake, the Coppermine River, along the southern shore of Hudson Bay. Its route passes directly through Ottawa, the Adirondacks and the border New York City. All I can give you David is command support. There is a fugitive. This man. was hiding, belongs to car number five. However, I would not be of any help, general. My wife is having a baby today! All right, guard, release this man. I will start the countdown down and give you the green light. Yes, sir. Ottawa is on red alert. You will obey all officers police and civil defense. Get under cover. All persons proceed toward the evacuation ree where possible. Get under cover. Repeat, take cover. Obey your guardians civil defense. Obey your guardians of civil defense. Ottawa is on red alert. Right now I'm putting the red alert the east coast. Issue the orders. Air Force Command. Air Force. as soon as possible, we recommend... Red alert. Get the interceptors off the ground for enemy missile attack. Instruct pilots to remain at a minimum distance of 5 miles ... Use full firepower. Sage is warned. This is where the orders go out to the fighter squadrons... which will take flight against the infernal missile. Pass on the intelligence. Hand me the radio room. This city is on the trajectory Of an out-of-control missile. In two minutes, the governor of the state... will be on all the stations television and radio stations, to declare martial law. You men know what to do In a code red situation. This is the situation code red situation. Eight million people are going underground. New Yorkers have been trained by warning drills. They know what to do. Turn off electricity and gas, fill pots with water and pans, obey your guardians civil defense. This is CONRAD, stay tune in to this station. This is Bill Bradley. Yes, I know who you are. Is the report true, governor? Yes, the missile will be over Ottawa in 51 minutes. Over New York six minutes later. Can we intercept it? Two Canadian anti-missile flights... have already been burned by the air around them. If all else fails, I don't know. How can we evacuate 10 million people? Well, I don't know, but we can at least. try to get the children out. Are you going to declare martial law? I must, and right away. ♪ That when my cousin says ♪ go, go, go ♪ ♪ He really means no, no... ♪ Excuse me. I've just been informed... that we are about to pass a special bulletin. Please keep this in mind. As long as you have your faith, you will be alive and well. So continue to have faith. Ladies and gentlemen, the governor of your state. Please listen carefully. To ensure your safety, I have declared martial law. Now there is no war, nor any danger of war. We are, however, in danger because of a flying object.... which may be approaching New York City. Obey all orders from the police and civil defense... For your own safety. As an additional precautionary... children will be taken from the school to a protected area. I have received orders to come here as quickly as possible. Irving. I have to be back by four o'clock To watch TV. We'll talk about that later. Jerry! Jerry! Mom! Oh honey. I won't let them take you away. Now don't cry sweetheart, don't cry. Please let Jerry come with us. No! No, I'm afraid I will never see him again. Please don't scare the children. Oooh, let him come. This is an opportunity. We are going to the country. Buses like this... they are picking up children from schools all over the city. Every driver prays that someone... does the same for his children. Save the youth. Walk, don't run, to the nearest shelter. Walk, don't run, to the nearest shelter. You will be directed by the officers of the civil defense. Don't panic, it increases the danger. Repeat, do not panic. No more trains will leave Manhattan. Don't panic, do not take to the streets. Stay underground. At Havenbrook Laboratory, David Loring is preparing children's warhead. These metal fingers reach for the artificial element, the plutonium. its radiation is the deadliest known. This warhead will have a destructive power... equal to 100,000 tons of TNT. Not so fast, Ella. Take care, honey. Mrs. Freed, we thought you had already gone to the hospital. You were supposed to come with your husband. What happened to your husband, Mrs. Freed? Oh, what a day. Forgive me for saying this, but nothing good has happened. What does it matter when it gets here? How do we know we will be here to greet him? Harold, you shouldn't be so pessimistic. Pessimistic? I am an optimist. I think the whole pile of bricks ... Will be blown away. It is the only optimistic thought I've ever had... since I got this job. Have you heard anything new? The last bulletin merely repeated... "leave the roads and go to a shelter." Oh, my radio, I had forgotten it. Ga! Listen. now we'll be as comfortable as A bug on a carpet here. Why do we have to be comfortable Like a bug here in the basement? Mother? Oh mother, the pain. What's the lady's problem, Mom? She's having a baby. You mean here now? I think so, honey. You stay here, and I'm going to see if I can help out. Dave. I had to come back. It's all right, sir, go ahead, I'll catch up with you. Don't worry about it, Joe, the warhead is ready. You can't use it. What's the problem? I know where that thing came from, it's more important than my wife, my child, more important than the whole city! What do you mean you you know where it comes from? It is not a missile. You saw the picture, a missile Intercontinental hydrogen-finned missile. Not intercontinental, Dave, interplanetary! A lost rocket, not impossible Joe, but right now we have to destroy it before it destroys us! You can't destroy him. It may have people inside, he is from another planet, we could get in touch With them, talk to them, think how important it would be for science, important for us! I know how important it is For us right now. I have to stop you, Dave, I have to stop you. This is Jove's base. The countdown is from 30 minutes to zero. Now. New York, quiet, waiting. Minutes remain. Last line of defense, Nike missiles around New York City are placed in launch position. The computer may have been wrong... on the missile that is about to hit New York City. This is a fact you have to face, you have to believe it. Millions of people, David. I can't. It's too terrible. It's hard to know That maybe you are going to die.... within an hour, hard to understand. It has to be approached without panic, possibly with some hope. It would have been better not to told him, much, much kinder. Let them continue to enjoy a beautiful morning in New York, at least they would never know ever what will have hit them. Could Joe be right, a lost spaceship? Certainly not impossible. No nation on earth Would launch such a missile, it would have to be a nation Of homicidal maniacs. We built Jove with a hydrogen warhead.... that can raze 800 square km. of the Earth. The job for which it was built, Jove will do today. On our wedding day. Jove will reach maximum speed maximum one minute after the launch, and its canopy will begin to burn. Contact with the lost rocket somewhere over Lake Champlain. I hope so. This is Jove's base. The countdown is 25 minutes to zero. Now. Phase one, negative. Phase two. The missile continues its its journey toward Ottawa. Five, four... Counterattack with a missile of the Hunter type Two, one, zero. Phase two, negative. Course and speed unchanged. Man, that was sudden. Just when the wolf was about to devour Little Red Riding Hood. I take 30 children to safety... and I don't even know what is happening to mine. Sidney, leave Sandra alone. Ms. Kelso, I'm raising my hand. When do you think it's safe to stop us...? Safe? Who knows where it is safe. I don't even know what's going on, except that New York is doomed. There must be at least two million children in New York. Who knows how many will make it out alive. All the ones we crossed were loaded with children. Martial law. No car will leave Manhattan unless unless it is carrying children. It must have been planned in this way. Oh, please let Jupiter do his work. Wow, look at the jeep, how it runs. Wow, an all-terrain jeep! That one had a big box inside. Probably a treasure. Wow, look at the way it spins That sports car! That crazy man! There are no children in that car. I thought only cars with children... That's why it's burning up the road. Cowardly selfish fool. Look at the way he runs. Go ahead! Move on! And now we'll give him a face. An eye... The eyes, the nose, the mouth (in French). And now he can smoke. Snowmen cannot smoke. Oh yes he can, look. There. Look, dad, look! Chuck, what is that? Ah! I don't know. Darling, come here. In the cabin, quickly, quickly, to the cabin! Quickly! He is a very strong child. When will I be able to play with him, mother? Oh, soon, my dear, very soon. Joe will be so proud. He always wanted a baby boy. Mother, how do you like my robe? Oh, it looks good on you, Ella. Just fine. How does it look? She's fine, Joe. A boy, Joe. Our baby boy. To give a baby boy minutes of life. Mr. Freed, do you know? A spaceship. A lost spaceship. Can you stop it? Can you stop the heat of the sun? Can you stop the tide? Or the life? The monster will not fall. It will go on and on until until the entire planet Earth... will be burned like a peeled apple. It will be over Britain on its fourteenth revolution. This means that in three days London will be in ashes. Stockholm one day, Paris one day, Rome two days, Moscow four days. The crazed missile is now 640 km. from Ottawa. Hand me the CONAD. Sir, it was Ottawa. In seven minutes It will pass over the city, New York City seven minutes later. People have been sent to shelters. Many find refuge in God. This junk is gone. Yeah, well, I'm not going to to walk all the way to town. We'll take whatever comes. David, be careful. I have to go as fast as I can. That thing in the back. It's built to withstand a bump. There's enough plutonium in there to blow up all of New York City. We are about 6 km. from the missile base. A jeep no less. Let's go. Hey, get out of the way that car! David! David! Let's run away! Stop it! Stand back or I'll stab her. - David! - Stop it! There's a bomb in that trunk! Yes, of course! This is Jove's base. The countdown is. The military has announced that a missile interceptor with an atomic warhead and capable of approaching the missile lost will be launched soon. stay tuned to this station. Lethal radiation. The lead shield of the box has been opened. Stop! Stop, please stop! Please give us a ride, it's urgent, I'm from the Atomic Center at Havenbrook, our car has been stolen and... There is always room for a couple more. Many thanks. This is Jove's base. The countdown is eight minutes to zero. Here is the jeep. Stop the car. - They opened the box. - David. Don't go near it, there is radioactive material! - David, what are you doing! - There is no other way! Loring protects his eyes, but he has condemned himself to death. - Stay away! - Stay back! - David! David, please! David! Please! David, David, please! Oh, David! Stand back! David! David, please! I love you! Joan Wood knows what it means plutonium radiation. David Loring will die in a few minutes. Ottawa awaits, a city ready to die. Nothing more can be done. Some will live, only to then remember, for the rest of their lives. The most horrific moments of destruction that man has ever known. Ottawa is gone, boiling cauldrons of steam... Melted lava, twisted beams, desolation. New York has five minutes. Hello, hero. I figured you would stay. We need to keep the flame alive, eh Max? Most of the guys stay, until the end. This is the basis of Jupiter. The countdown is from four minutes to zero. Now. Dr. Loring is at the gate. This is Jove's base. The countdown is three minutes to zero. Now. This is Jove's base. The countdown is two minutes to zero. Now. It will never arrive in time. With all that radiation, he may not even live long enough to try. This is Jove's base. The countdown is 30 seconds to zero. Now. 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
