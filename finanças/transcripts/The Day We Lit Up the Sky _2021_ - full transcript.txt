Registration for "Strictly Come Dancing" is about to start. We've got to get in this year. Come! 171 cm. 170 cm. 55 cm. 41 cm. Your shoulders are really narrow. Please come over here, everybody. Stand still. The final criteria to determine who will make the team and attend the competition includes top dancing techniques, standard weight and height, and also consistent skin tone. What's that for? Huang. I'm here. Uh... what the teacher was trying to say is you can't pull off miraculous makeover on a dried salted fish. Somebody still thinks she's a mermaid. We don't want to dance with the little sea maid. She smells like salted fish. Except for Huang, other girls should get ready for the next round of dance tryouts. Everyone, please get in your position. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. Auntie! Auntie! I heard you came to retake your courses. Yeah, my grades weren't great. Don't be too ambitious. Auntie, you're just like in the old days. Graceful and gorgeous! You were only three years old last time I saw you. I didn't think you'd remember anything. I still remember something. By the way, your dad didn't invite you to his own wedding? My dad said that I'm a little bit too old to be the ring bearer and a little bit too young to be his best man. Fine. It's you right here. Auntie, just wait... Hey! Wait up! Are you okay? I thought I smelled salted fish. Turns out it's the little sea maid. Hurry up! The commencement dance is about to start! You are the little sea maid. From the Hans Christian Andersen Fairy Tales. Dance show of the commencement! Get ready! A new semester begins. Run like a flag in the wind. Let's cheer! Hi youngsters. Give me five. Guide me in the future. We are ready to get going. Get going. Encounter laughter and tears. I guess sunshine and rainy days are also our classmates. Youth is just like the chocolate in a box. When you have faith in the adventure in the box, you'll find tomorrow. Lalalalala. It's your dream blooming. Lalalalala. It's your new self blooming. Lalalalala. It's a song blooming. Lalalalala. It's the fireworks blooming. Pop quiz is on the way. Go ahead and take the exam. School uniforms and sneakers. We are shoulder to shoulder. Read your heart. I'll always be there for you. On my count, 3, 2, 1. Let's go together. Youth is just like the chocolate in a box When you have faith in the adventure in the box, The future of the young is only bright and refreshing. It's the whole summer blooming. Are you going to be my chocolate box? It's an adventure blooming. We are going to see the sea. Look! What's the little sea maid doing? What the hell is that? Why is there a boy in our school? Those two just look silly! Hurry! Your school is across the street. We've been talking about doing something big since the third grade, but after all these years, what is that "something" really? Since ancient times, every trio has been trying to achieve something big. Look at the three sworn brothers, Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. I think we are just short of a chance. You mean we just need an opportunity? Right. We are short of one goal or one person. Or one person. I heard everything you guys just said. Who are you? I'm the new transfer. You're my soldier. I'm your soldier! No! You're my unqualified soldier. I'm your unqualified soldier. No! You can't meet my soldier standard! How could I face the principal of the female high school? I'm sorry. I'm still a student. That's right. It's 3 o'clock now. Stand here for two hours as a punishment. If there's anyone here who is willing to keep you company... I'll cut half an hour for you. Sir! I will stand with him. Me, too. I'm willing to do that. My street name is Ol' Dog. My street name is Traditional Chinese Dragon. Impressive! A traditional Chinese dragon tattoo! I'm Handsome Ze! I'm Li. We're up for something big. Come on! It's pretty simple. Come on. I'm the best. I'm the skinniest. I'm just asking, why should we all act like monkeys up here? Look! Hello! It's me! Look over here! They think I'm slick, and... cute. They think I'm... What's the deal with the female high school? Their school dance team is famous. They're quite impressive. They've attended Strictly Come Dancing competition every year. Who's that girl? They are call her little sea maid. The little sea maid really lives up to expectations. Her conduct grade was negative at the beginning of the semester. That's because she caused trouble in the commencement dance performance. Does her superstar mom know about her negative conduct grade? Of course not. Stop looking at the little sea maid. There's a boy here. He wants to transfer here. What's wrong with you? You're a boy. You want to transfer to a female high school. Because I saw them dancing at the commencement ceremony. For the very first time in my life, I felt impressed and shocked. You know how to dance? No, I don't. But I really do love dancing. I think... what drives us is not some dancing technique. It's the... deep love. That's silly. He's a perfect match for Huang. They'll make such a cute couple! Such a cute couple! Security. Let's go. Let's go. Hey! Young man! Young man! Why did you moan? Why did you sigh? I moan because I'm lonely. I sigh because I'm solitary. That's pretty artsy. I get you. But it won't work to do this if you would like to dance here. How much should I spend to get on your dancing team here? Money is even more useless. Only your dancing skills have voice here. That... how did you get in? Your moves are quite different from others'. Because I'm the lead. So, my moves and rhythm are for sure different from others'. I thought all the leads should stand in front of everyone. Big bro. You were talking about the lead for radio gymnastics. Don't you think our performance was impressive? It's quite impressive. Is it innovative? It's innovative. Is it unexpected? Yes. That's why you could not have guessed. Where do our leads stand? That makes sense. Dancing is a piece of cake. Imagine that you are a piece of straw. I'm a piece of straw. Go with the wind. Go with the wind. You've got all four limbs that dancing requires. The only piece missing here is a stepping stone to success. What is it? The invitation to the prom. Can I for real get in? Of course. I'm feeling something here. Apparently, only the lead knows the shortcut to dance success. Isn't that right? That's right. Go, go, go! Thanks, little sea maid. What does it mean here by saying please attend in formal dress? Does it mean normal dress? I think it means suits and tie. Let's try this shop. Let's go make some money and buy suits and ties! What can you guys do? We can deliver salted fish for you. I've hired a driver for that. Why should I hire you guys? We are really strong. That... you should really show me what you've got. We're in good shape. Good shape. Please tell me what kind of girl deserves a special present like this? I really want to be a girl. I want somebody to give me a present like this. I wish I were a girl. My daughter should be out of school now. Please stop. Put them away. Hurry up. I don't want her to see it and spoil the surprise. Hurry! Hurry up! You're in probation period. Come again next time. Thanks boss! Thanks! Go. My daughter's back. Who are those four boys there? The new help I just hired. The timing is perfect. Let's go. What is it? How's your day at school today? Wait. It's a lot, that's for sure. This is for your prom. Prom or whatever... I'm not interested. You can't say whatever on that. Your mom is... Come on... You've fooled me for so many years. If my mom really is Sammi, how come she's never come to see me? I told you that before. Loving her means setting her free. She works hard to be a superstar. She's happy now, and we should be happy for her. I'm not a child any more. So... how could I fool you? You should look up to your mother. Be confident. Be kind. Be glowing. Fine. Where's my mom? I want to see my mom. That's your mom. Do you see her there? You can see your mom everywhere. Your mom's here. She's so pretty. Your mom's there. This is your mom. Here. So pretty. Your mom's here. When can I get to meet my real mom? You... you really should learn how to dance. You get to see your mom if you could dance well. I want to be like mom. What's so exciting? Your dress is in the color of salted fish, am I right? What is the color of salted fish? Welcome to the prom night of Haikou middle schools. We've been looking forward to this moment for a long time. Let's dance! The student over there. You... Where's your prom date? The little sea maid should be dancing with the monkey king. Our mundane people are not privileged enough to dance with her. If you don't have a prom date... that... Wait. Her prom date is me. We are here today to warm up the prom for everyone. My motto is be happy and live a healthy life. In the future, I want to be a happy guy. Such a shame. What performance are you putting on here? Imagine you are a piece of straw. There's a fine line between a straw and a waster. So what? As long as you're happy. Why are you wiggling like that, you female monster! Come here! You come here! Don't we look like Monkey King and Fairy Zi Xia? What are you talking about? I came to your rescue on the seven-colored clouds. How could you call this seven-colored clouds? By the way, you can call me Ol' Dog. And you? You can just call me Huang. What car is this? It's a special car of Strictly Come Dancing. What is Strictly Come Dancing? It's a dance competition. Do you want to attend it? Yes. Because I really love dancing. I wish I could be just like my mom. Be free. And be myself. Who is your mom then? That should be... another miracle then. I believe in miracles. It doesn't matter if you believe them or not. It does matter because there's people like me on Earth. Now that you've seen what you saw today, you should know what little sea maid means. It means salted fish. Salty sea breeze. I know. It feels good! We'll have this afternoon off for Mid-Autumn Festival. Where are you going to go, Bro Dog? We three are together anyway. Come with us. Yes. Yep. Why are they looking at us? Let me check with them. An Yugang. I'm so sorry. We just thought it was huge when you crashed the prom night. Bro Dragon is the real deal here. When Bro Dragon's tattoo meets water, it becomes a real flying dragon. Traditional Chinese Dragon! You big fat liar! You drew your tattoo with a pen. Even though you guys are trending on Weibo, your tattoo's fake. How dare you pretend that you're a badass here! That's right. Now those girls are looking down at us, all because of you shameless people. Maybe our school is not the best when it comes to the school environment and students, but we still have our own dignity. You cannot go out and tarnish our school reputation. That's right. Is your place fun? How many clothes should I pack to visit your place? You don't need to come over. That's all your fault. You have to make us all go to the prom night. That's the only reason why we became such a joke, and that's the only way they can find out that all my tattoos are fake. That's not on me. Fine. I'll blame myself for that. You can blame me then. I don't have anywhere else to go if I can't go over to your place. Hurry up! Let's go home for Mid-Autumn Festival. Are you here attracting guests or just kicking them out? We're running out of liquor. You don't have a business without me! Bro Hong. It's Mid-Autumn Festival. That's right. My son is coming back for the holiday. Let me introduce to you, this is my best friend Smash, and this is Hit. Hello. How could you hide it without holding your breath? Why are you not talking? Can you talk? Can I go now? Go. You can go if you wish. You can go ahead and pick on me if you have balls. You mean you alone? Stop "you"? Me. Go hide behind my back. Shame on you guys. Why is it your business that we're picking on him? It is my business. Who are you to him? That's right. Who am I? Me? Me? I'm his mother. I'm sorry, ma'am. That's impressive. Sorry, ma'am. We'll get out of your face now, ma'am. Bye. I bumped into you again. Why are you such a coward? I'm just being polite. Why not admit you're a coward? What makes you think that? What makes you think you're not? I don't hide myself from them. I get bullied by them fair and square. I never ran away from them. Why are they playing this video every single year? Switch. Still it. I mean why does she only exist on TV? My dear daughter, your dad's way of keeping you company is Always watching out for you and always being there for you every step of the way. Your mom's way is just different. She has to be on TV and on the stage... I mean I want my mom to be around for holidays and special occasions. The kind of mom who I can touch and feel. Not this elegant mom who is out of reach all the time. She's trying to be a role model for you, isn't she? I don't want some role model. I want a real mom. Hello. Dad? Happy Mid-Autumn Festival. Hello. Your dad is in the middle of something now. He'll call you when he's got time. Oh... Can you hear me? Hear me? Can you hear me? Hear my unspoken words? Will the moonlight receive it? Missing someone feels like me dancing with my own shadow silently yet loudly. I want to run toward you in the dark; call your name by my heartbeat; tell it's you from your back in the crowd fly to you wobbly. Fly to you. When we both look up to the moon our eyes meet in the sky. We will miss each other when we apart. Breeze is calling. The moon is whispering. I am no longer alone when they keep me company chasing the light. Who is it? Me. Your Bro Dog. You are all by yourself on holiday like this? Aren't you alone as well? I'm missing my mom. Your mom is not by your side. I only know she exists. I've never met her. Who's your mom? That superstar who is always on TV, on posters and on all kinds of stages? That's right. Oh... That's great. Can't believe you buy that. Of course. Watch me. Happy Mid-Autumn Festival. Happy Mid-Autumn Festival. Happy Mid-Autumn Festival. Hurry. Come and find me. Well... I'm sorry. That's alright. It doesn't matter how they see us, as long as we are happy. But we are always the laughingstock here. I feel awful. That's why I wanted to draw a dragon character in traditional Chinese. I want to pretend that I'm a bad-ass. So nobody would laugh at us. For so many years, we haven't done one impressive thing. We've been looked down at and laughed at. It feels so bitter to think that we might have to end our youth with this. No wonder you three were talking about getting something big done the whole time. Getting something big done. As a matter of fact, we are not cut out for it. Unless... unless there's a miracle. A miracle? I believe in miracles. Do you want to attend it? Yes. Because I really love dancing. Look. That's the miracle you are looking for. Tell me now. What are we good at? We are good at nothing. That's right. We fear nothing because we are good at nothing. That's right. Yes. We should attend the dance competition together. That's right. No matter what we do, we'll get laughed at. We might've just go on one stage and try our best. Try our best. Great! Getting laughed at is nothing new for us. But if we can succeed at this, at least we won't be laughed at from the beginning to the end of our youth. Everyone, do you have a dream or not? No. Do you want to have a dream? No, we don't. That's okay. Then we can do something that has nothing to do with dreams. Let's dance together. Speaking of dancing, there's one person here. Are you talking about the one from the junior high? Are we going to invite him to join us? Who? He's a legend. Tell me about it. He's from our junior high. We all call him Bro Hua. He's doing some good deeds outside the campus. He was totally out-numbered and fought 10 people. He took out all the people with the dancing move Thomas flair in place. He gets his name out because of the fight. Why did I fail the test again? We should totally recruit him. But his only passion is studying. He only friends people who can help him study. We should help him study then. Help him get better grades. Then he has to join us in the dancing competition. Which one of us could help him study then? Me. Bro Hua. Everyone is good at certain things and not good at others. For example, I am terrible at Chinese language and literature. Maybe I am good at math. You help me study? You help me study? We can go another way. You can help me study instead. I help you study? Then we'll repay you by taking you to the competition. It will please you physically and mentally. Such a healthy way of living. It's getting late today. We should get together and study tomorrow. Don't go. Since we've made up our minds already, we can do some previews before classes tomorrow. Now? That's right. Now. It's fine if they've turned off the lights. He does that every day. So, I'm well prepared. I've brought candles with me. The starlight enlightens your future. We are reading for our bright future. Sit down. Punctuations listed below are used in wrong ways. Please note that they are incorrectly used. Don't look at them the wrong way. Maybe you thought they were the correct ways. Then you might see them as the correct ways. Hey! Pay attention. How do you read this character? Dancing team! The fifth member of the team, Yang Qianhua is here now. Welcome! Senior schoolmate. Lead. Can I give it a go? Why do you have to join the dancing team? Because I want to attend the competition with you. Why's that? My mom is one of the judges. I want to dance for her. Here comes the teacher. Gather together. I'll make an announcement. This is the list of members who are attending Strictly Come Dancing. Everyone of the dancing team is going! Huang. Come here. Come here. This time, I'll leave the most important dance move to you. Me? Yes. I'll show you how to do it. Alright. When you attend the competition, you'll be facing the judges and audience. Then what? Take a deep bow. Then announce the name of our dance and our dancing team. Then what? Which position I should go back to in the team? You are not going back. Your whole performance ends here. What do you expect? What about... you take my place? I thought her dancing moves were quite fine actually. However, she doesn't really fit in my formation. Salted fish. With pink ribbons. Who is doing this? Who? You should go and check yourself what's going on outside the school gate. It's not your place here. Are you trying to set up a stall here? I really do like the color of your car, uncle. Thanks! It really fits you. Please root for Huang. Please. Please root for Huang. Come here. Thanks, uncle. Your daughter is so popular in our school. Isn't that right? Of course. Please! Thank you! Come over here. All of you! My dear daughter! It smells so nice. Your dad is so nice. Thanks so much for your fish. It looks nice. How is it? Did you get in? It has nothing to do with your dad. It's all your own work. Why are you taking all those tacky things to my school? What are you doing here? We've got our own school dance team now. We'd like to invite you to be our lead and coach. What does that have to do with me? We'd love to learn dancing from you. You... are joking here, right? We mean it. You're the lead in your team. You can come to our team and coach us then. Are you some kind of idiot? How could I be the lead? I think you are qualified. Do I look like a lead to you? Of course you do. I can't do it. I'm short and tanned. And my conduct grade is negative now. We are the same. We don't have a stellar conduct grade either. We are just as bad. And... all of us are not really good at dancing. You can have all the spotlight to yourself. Why are we doing this together after all? To get laughed at with you? No. We can go and attend the competition together. Strictly Come Dancing. You mean you? You think you can make it to the competition? Have you won even once in your life? That's why I am trying to win for the very first time. You can't do that. Hey. Here's what I'm thinking. We couldn't have won without you. But now that we've got you, we can win. Who said anything about me joining you guys? Because I'm not. Stop following me. I'm not giving up. You have to join us. As long as you have faith, nothing is impossible. I don't buy that any more. How... How about... I pay you? How about I pay you 200 yuan a lesson for coaching us? I'll do it. Give it to me. Give it to me. Now? You can say all the things you want. It doesn't mean a thing if you don't even have 200 yuan. Forget it. I'm tight on money recently. Can I give it to you after a few days? 200 yuan for a lesson. I always honor my word. It's a good bargain. It's totally worth it. You are Sammi's daughter after all. Join us! Let's go to Strictly Come Dancing together! Join us! For real! Join us. Let's go to Strictly Come Dancing together! Can you just give it a go? Give it a go! Give it a go! Hey! What are you trying to do here? I have no intention getting hit by raindrops. Nobody can hit on you except me. Not even the rain. My dad told me if a boy is chasing after you the whole time, he is really chasing after you then, especially in rainy days. Watch your mouth. Why should I believe that you guys can actually dance? You said it yourself. Dancing is actually pretty easy. We should be like a piece of straw. Go with the wind. Do you know why is there rainbows? Enlighten me. Leave some to me! I'll invite Huang to be our dancing coach. 200 yuan for a lesson. 200 yuan? 5 of us together is not worth 200 yuan. No way. It's so expensive to learn to dance. It's true. No one can succeed easily. Use your brain. Huang's different from the other girls at the female school. She's distinctive in her own way. She must be poor. Poor? Yeah. She's supporting her family by teaching dance. So we must help her to tide over her difficulties. It's a good deed. Boss. You even get your uncle from your village in the team? He's my schoolmate. Here's the thing. We've got 5 people here. You can just pay us 200 yuan for a day. 200 yuan? Get lost. Boss. 5 people. 200 yuan for a whole day. That's a good bargain. It means you only need to pay 40 yuan for one person a day. Whatever. Fine. Even beggars ask for more. Why don't we just go to streets and beg for money? You're making a point here. But what about we try to make some money on our own first? Boss. You said it yourself you'd pay us more this time. That's right, boss. Otherwise, we'll really become beggars. Then be beggars. Let's go. Make money on our own. Okay. Stop moving things around. Just get the ribbons off of the fish. It really takes time and effort to do that. My daughter doesn't really like it. It looks so cute. If your daughter doesn't like it, it's because she has bad taste. If you have good taste, just tell me, what girls in your age like usually? They like boys in their age. Do you know what your missing piece is? We don't know ourselves well enough. Now that's you knowing yourself well enough right there. Where's our coach? Hi, coach. Hi, coach. But... the missing piece is some real music. Come on. Let's dance together. Come on. One. Three. Okay, let's do it again. Pull back. Spread. Six. This dance really hurts my eyes. I can't believe somebody is learning this. What about... we forget about it for a bit? We were getting laughed at before this. Now, we can't help but laugh at ourselves. I heard this kid has been learning how to dance recently. After you learn how to dance, you're still some salted fish. Still some salted fish. I could feel all of my fat vibrating while I was running. Now all of my fat shakes even more when I am dancing. We are too fat. We are incompatible with the whole world. Do you get it? I still need some dignity to hold on to. Now I... only have this much left. We cannot pull this off anyway. What about... we do something else for a change, and try our best again? I'll pay you a little bit more. Thanks, boss. Go. Now, we've got money. By the way, boss, do you know who the first dancer is? Why did he decide to dance? Can I have those fish to myself? Why's that? I want to give it to my coach. Thanks. Bye. You are dancing better and better now. That's for sure. We are all trying our best. That's great. I'll keep up the great effort too. I'll go on stage with our dancing team. And I'll dance for my mom. Even though I only have one move to do. As long as I can step foot on stage, I'll catch my mom's eyes. That's some strong faith. Oh... right. That's the money we should pay for the past days. Are you serious? You guys did not go and beg for money, did you? Of course not. We made money by working at a salted fish store. Salted fish store again. How could I get all the money from some salted fish stores my whole life? What do you mean? My dad is selling salted fish too. It's really lousy. He pretends that he is really classy. He comes up with those tacky things all the time. My mom must have been fed up with that and left us. Speaking of which, I've got a present for you. How is it? You like it, right? Where did you get this? Our boss gave it to me. Your boss? Maybe our boss looks clumsy and coarse on the outside. Even a little tacky. But... he came up with such a cute idea to tie a bow knot with a pink ribbon on the salted fish. Isn't that adorable? You think it's adorable? I don't think the salted fish is adorable. I think our boss is quite adorable. What do you say? How much does he love his daughter for him to come up with such a funny way to try to please her? And, one more thing. He told us that his daughter is learning how to dance too. He describes his daughter as a fairy. He also told us that his daughter can absolutely dance better than our coach, which means you. We got pissed right there. You can't make biased statement like that. Not even when you are talking about your own daughter. We almost fought him. I just wish my dad could do the same thing for me. You are back. That's me doodling right there. I'm changing the package here. Dad. The pink ribbon is nice enough. Others don't like it because... Because what? I'm the little sea maid. You are Sammi's daughter. The superstar. Isn't it a lie? Has your dad ever lied to you? Why's that I haven't got any of my mom's beauty and body? Who said that? You are quite talented at dancing. That's right. I've been teaching others dancing recently. My daughter's a coach now. That's right. My daughter's a coach now. That's impressive. 200 yuan for a lesson. That does not worth your while. You can dance so well. Here. You've been giving me enough pocket money. Now, this is me repaying you. You are repaying me with only 200 yuan? You think 200 yuan is enough to repay me? Isn't this my money? Strictly Come Dancing must be fascinating this year. That's right. The whole dancing team is going. They put out the list today. Do you think we can win the championship this year? That's for sure. No need to argue that. How come I don't see your name on the list? Can't you even take a bow in the correct way? Teacher. Why isn't my name on the list? We don't need an announcer for the competition any more. Please allow me to be on the stage for a second. I just need one second under the spotlight. I just want my mom to see me. Are you sure she's your mom? It's OK that you kid around with us. Don't believe in your own lie. We've already submitted the list. She's not even the announcer now. That's right. And her dad actually sent out a truck of salted fish for her. Huang. I think you haven't practiced enough. One minute on stage takes ten years of practice off stage. Think about it. If your dad found out about this, it must be really hurtful to him. He sent out so many gifts. He even tied pink ribbon on the salted fish. That's really tacky. That's pretty out of line now. Are you OK? Hello. We are the dancing team of Fulin Female High School. Hello. We are the dancing team of Fulin Female High School. Hello. We are the dancing team of Fulin Female High School. Hello. We are the dancing team of Fulin Female High School. Hello. We are... the dancing team of Yangguang High School. Our coach is Huang. We are going to do a dance routine that we've learned from our coach Huang. Five, six, seven, go. One. Two. Three. Two. Three. Four. Go. They're all laughing at you! Go. Go. We can't watch you getting bullied and do nothing. Let's show them what we've got. We are the dancing team of Yangguang High School. You've seen that. I've been coaching you every day. But I actually am only an announcer. I actually have nothing to do... Hey, coach! Did we just do a dance over the wrong way? That's right. Did we do the third dance move to the end backwards? Coach! You might need to coach us more strictly in the future. That won't happen with me again. That's right, coach. We are going to Strictly Come Dancing with you. I'll quit on being an announcer then. We are going to Strictly Come Dancing together. Strictly Come Dancing. We still have open slots for the school dance team. Please join us, everyone. Let's shine together. Don't you have some dreams? Light up your life. Youngster! Let's dance! Welcome to join us! Let's dance! There isn't more people coming to join us after all. You don't really know young boys. What do you mean by that? Forget about those useless pitch lines. I only want to emphasize one thing. We've got a pretty girl in the dancing team. We've only got limited slots. You can go signing up under the coconut tree on the playground. What are they doing? It seems that they are going to attend a dancing competition called Strictly Come Dancing. The king of bathhouse. The flexible waist. If it's not us dancing for the school, who'll do the honor? Bath towels go with the wind. I am the king of cafeteria. In order to dance, egg dumplings, burghers braised pork feet, do not mean a thing to us. Dancing is the food that we need. For the competition this afternoon, I have to inform you, coach. I've sprained my ankle. I sprained my back. I broke my fingernails really bad. It's not healed yet. Goodbye, court. Drop all of your act. Come back. That's because of the pretty girl. Sign up before it's too late. Step up to dance. Only for the things you love. Sign up before it's too late. My mind only goes to peace and love. I think the things they love is quite lovely. Sign up before it's too late. Step up to dance. Only for the things you love. Peace and love. I've got good news for all of you. I'll cancel all the extracurricular activities. If you want to attend the competition, your ranking must rise by 10 spots. I don't want you to go and just be mad as you want. Let's catch up on our physics lessons today. Do you know theorem of kinetic energy? Do you know Coulomb Law? Do you know light refraction? No, I don't. You should know about rainbow after all. That I know. It's a lucky charm that can get you pass all the exams, right? That's shooting star you are talking about. What is rainbow then? It's the sunshine after heavy rain. It's the trip a drop of water takes. The angle between sunshine and the ground equals theta. It travels through the water curtain to put on a romantic show. The interface where air meets water. Sneil's law refraction appears here. The sine of the angle of incidence over the sine of the angle of refraction. The light moves forward in light-speed after leaving the interface and turn into the rainbow and goes to the clouds. Let's do the refraction of back of the water drop part one more time. Go through the water drop at last. The direction it goes slightly changes again. The light deflected 42 degrees and catch your eyes just like that. So that is what it is. Why are there seven colors in rainbows? Sunshine has painted the world in a warm white. The white consists of 7 colors. It's 7-color white. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and purple. It's going through the air and enter the face of water drop. The direction might be deflected. You've been discussing for so long. What is light after all? Newton said light is particle. Huygens said light is wave. Einstein said no no no. Light is particle, and light is wave. Light is not particle, not particle, nor the wave. Oh... I get that. This is the wave-particle duality of light. That's a knowledge point for college entrance exam. Newton said light is particle. Huygens said light is wave. Light brings warm and happiness. It shines on flowers. It shines on us. Every straw, straw... Every straw. Every corner. Great. We can call ourselves "Team Straw In The Breeze", We dance when we meet the breeze. Don't have the time to bother. We are just like straws in the field. We grow up freely and wildly. Make a pact to be happy together and to grow up together. Simple and easy. The sun is shining. We've been silly together. We've been lectured together. We've run loops and been punished together. We are a group of great fellows. Who's the monkey king? It's me. Who's the little sea maid? It's me. Important to one another. It's like the sun. We make a fuss together. Together we are straws. We are crying and laughing without thinking it through. We are all great. We pick the stars even with muddy hands. We are together. Even if we fall, we can still run forward. We are straws. We are happy silly people. We are all great. We are very small but extra strong. We hold hands and shout out to the world. Get ready for the breeze. Go with it! What if they cannot pass the exam? That's alright. No matter what, I will go with you. Why should you do that? You really do love dancing this much? That's right. I really do love dancing very much now. Why's that? Because, I can have you by my side all the time. You like me? You don't like me? Are you 18 years old and able to talk about adult stuff? I'm here to retake all senior year courses. Of course I'm 18 years old already. Fortunately, I am 18 years old, too. Then it should be okay for us to talk about this. Emm. You didn't say this just because you're an adult now, did you? I said it because I meant it. Are you silly or something? The Ferris wheel is silly. All it can do is stand right there and wait. Get my shoulder ready and wait for the moon. Make all her dreams come true. The Ferris wheel is silly. All it fears is the moon might get cold. Turn on the warm light. Fly with her. No matter how thick the clouds get, he can't get his eyes off you. Are you going to make a wish when it reaches the highest point? I'll just go wherever you go. Do you think there's a palace on the clouds? We can go and check ourselves because you can fly. We see the sky as our playground. We don't cry when we fall. We can run forward and laugh. There's light ahead. The Ferris wheel is waiting for you at our old place. He is my sun in the heavy rain. She is my loud moon in my sweet dream. Can you find the palace on the clouds? We can keep flying from the next stop. We see the sky as our playground. We don't cry when we fall. We can run forward and laugh. There's light ahead. The Ferris wheel is waiting for you at your old place. Stumble around. Somebody is always waiting for you at our old place. I've passed. Passed or not? What? I can't hear you! Somebody said she's Bro Hua's wife. And she wants to buy us dinner. I know what's going on now. Because Bro Hua is from some rural area, he got married when he was really young. Now they are buying us dinner to announce their marriage. Is that right? We've been married for 5 years. You guys got married when you were 10? Bro Hua is 28 years old this year. Why is he still in junior high? He was in a special situation. Silly. His parents passed away when he was young. He's the elder brother in the family. He needed to provide for his younger brother and sister. So he set up a stall to sell things when he was young. What's the deal? You still don't understand math? What's going on? Hurry up. After we got married, our family wasn't as tight on money. We thought he could just go to school. Once he's not illiterate, he won't be fooled and bullied. I am telling you, listen to your teacher in class. Do you get it? If your classmates ever bully you, you need to tell your teacher about that. I asked you to meet me today because I want to talk to you. Could you not include him in the future dancing competition? I'm sorry. My wife has been working her ass off. I can't humiliate her any more. It's not humiliating to go to junior high when you are 28. And it's not humiliating to attend the dancing competition with us. We have a family to support. Do you know what it means to support a family? I'll just tell you one thing. That meal we had right there cost my wife half month of her salary. I'm sorry. Good luck with the competition. We need to dance well for the preliminary competition. Just to honor Bro Hua's efforts. What are you doing here? We came to see Sammi. Why do you want to see Sammi? Let me pass. Sammi's there. Huang. Hurry up, go find your mom. Go find your mom! Go! I have something important that I need to talk to you. My dad said you were my mom. That's the end of me. Be happy, boss. I get it now. Sorry to bother you. Did you grow up with your father since you were little? You must've asked your dad where your mom was when you were little. Then you happened to see my performance on TV at that time. Your dad said your mom's right here and she became a super star. So you know everything. Are you my mom or not. You can just call me as a psycho here. I... I'm just joking. I was joking the whole time. I... I'm actually your fan. I'm here to follow the superstar I love. That's just my dad. I am always humiliated by him. Don't you think your dad is great? It's pretty difficult to lie to a person for more than a decade. It takes a lot of effort. Every single holiday it's pretty hard every time. It's pretty easy to make up a fairy tale story. However, it takes a lot more than a simple lie to guard a fairy tale story. It takes love to do that. That's a weird outfit. Why are the boys dressed like this? It's so ugly. What the hell is that? It's their first year, right? That dancing is a mess. That's just awful. Get out of here. The coach is disappointed in us, isn't she? Yes, she is. She's been so good to us and done so much for us. I suggest we go and apologize to the coach. Ol' Dog. Huang is leaving. She says she will never dance again. Huang. We still have a long way to go. We can dance again when we have chance. I will never dance again. I danced because I wanted my mom to see me. It's all pointless now. I'm sorry. We've been practicing together for so long. We can't make it to the final... No matter what happened, we have to keep dancing. Because you really excel at dancing. Hop in. The festooned vehicle has been following us. This is the girl you like, right? That's why we have to catch up with them. We can. That's the classic plot in all those romantic movies. Right? Relax. I got your back. Sit tight. Huang. I have one more dance that I would like to show you. What are you doing? Why did you stop? We're out of gas. Out of gas? You've been driving the festooned vehicle of Strictly Come Dancing around. Where's the miracles the show pitched? We're out of gas because we're dancing all the time. You'll have your miracle eventually. Where's the miracle? The super thunderstorm suddenly has formed and will pass Haikou recently. We will close all the harbors and terminals immediately. Please take preventive measures. Bro Dog. Bro Dog. Keep dancing. Don't stop. Bro Dog, here we come. Dance! Sorry, Coach Huang. Goodbye, Coach Huang! There will be a hurricane in Haikou. The school will close for the week. Come home with me. Just to chill. Uncle San. Auntie San. Long. I brought him here to chill. Welcome. Uncle San. Hello. Taste good! Here comes the seafood. Steamed crab. We've got crabs here. Thanks, Auntie San. We've got one extra dish here. Come over, hurry up! You are still quite young. You need to get some more. Li, get some of this. It's your favorite. I like this. Long, what's the matter? Young man. No matter what happened, be happy and have some more. Here. Thanks, Uncle San. You're welcome. That's right. Get some more. Give him some more. This is delicious. Here. Get some more. Get a crab. Get some more. What are we doing here? Digesting. Since when do we need to put digesting down in our calendar? We live here peacefully and quietly. We don't have much of things to do. Certainly, we've got plenty of time to do other stuff. That's right. I heard the female high school did not make it to the finals. It's different for you. You can watch the final. Isn't that right? Why can't you be happy now? It's not because of the final now, right? No. I am very happy. It's pretty good. What do you think Huang is doing now? If you don't know, how should we know? Yeah. You've got a point here. Young man. Long told me that you just went through a breakup. Why made such a fuss about one breakup? When I broke up with somebody, I got pretty sulky just like you. I didn't get sulky. Later there was a dancing king coming to our farm. He taught me how to dance. That's how I wooed your auntie San. That's neat. Back then, we didn't really have that opportunity. We weren't allowed to do that. We had nothing like what you have today. You have everything now. You can dance every day. Why are you still sulky? If only I could have what you have now, I should be the dancing king of the era. There wouldn't be King salted fish any more. Really? Why should I lie to you? Let me tell you. When you dad was young, I killed at our farm with one dance. As soon as you learn this dance, you can totally win her back. She always only left me her phone number Never allows me to drive her home. I heard that you also once fell in love with her. You, once the same were not able to pull yourself out. You said that you weren't able to learn how to pretend to be at ease. Yet you taught me not to give her up too early. You mentioned about the past like it's a legend. Then we laughed at each other and thought we were silly in the same way. We care about her so much yet our love was totally obliterated by her. The more we cherish her, the more heart broken we become. We never will get the answer that we want. What exactly does she think? Should we keep guessing? It might as well that we agree to totally forget about it. You said that you weren't able to learn how to pretend to be at ease. Yet you taught me not to give her up too early. You mentioned about the past like it's a legend. Then we laughed at each other and thought we were silly in the same way. So, my family signed me up for a tutoring school. I'm going back. Alright. However, it might not be possible for us to all meet in the university. Our grades are too bad. We couldn't get in those universities. Is it possible that we might not get to see Bro Dog again? Bro Dog. I'll miss you. By the way, I didn't even like dancing before. Me neither. Me neither. Me neither. But now, I really do want to keep dancing with you guys. Have you ever thought about who's the first dancer in the world? And why was he dancing after all? How should I know? Have you ever thought about who's the first dancer in the world? And why was he started dancing? That's right. What? You knew? The other day in my store, the help I hired asked me the same question. Of course I don't know the answer. But I could've guessed. In ancient times, our ancestors went back home after a tired long day. They lived in caves. It was really dark. Somebody set up a bonfire. Everyone circled the bonfire. Then, it was a night like tonight. In the night breeze, under the shining stars, they held hands and started dancing. They kept each other warm. They feared the darkness no more. After all... After all, human being is quite fragile. Dad. Who is my mom? Here comes the talk again. She is your mom. Your mom has been watching for all these years. When will I get to see my real mom? You... really need to learn how to dance well. As long as you can dance well, you get to see your mom. I just want to be like my mom. Mom. Strictly come dancing, and you are the miracle. Hello to all of you who are watching live on Weibo and who have come to our final of Strictly Come Dancing. Welcome! Our final is going live today. It's really special. Because we are at the wind turbine platform in South China Sea. Youngsters are breeze. It generates power for youth. Dance move is breeze. It generates power for dream.

Dear passengers, please board the ship with your ticket. Dear passengers, please board the ship with your ticket. Young girl. Young girl! Young girl1 Hello, young girl. Will you be watching our final today? Do you think they've put on a good show? Yes. Have you thought about dancing yourself? Coach! I knew how to dance at the first place. How about this? If there's an opportunity for you to join our champion dancing team, would you take it? I've got my own dancing team. Then why didn't you come to our final? We lost in the preliminary competition. We were out. You still have some regrets from the bottom of your heart, right? Of course there are regrets. We practiced together for so long. Who doesn't want to win the game? Of course. Every person tries their best is looking for a positive outcome. Isn't there more to life than winning? Like what? Like losing in a happier way. Thanks! Look at Huang! I really do have regrets. We are going to graduate soon, and going parted ways. One of my regrets is that nobody will ever say "we'll do something big together" blatantly. One of my friends once said there are more important things in life than just winning. We can lose in a happier way. Nothing is more important than dancing together. Those underdogs, those students with poor grades, those ineloquent people. Don't they deserve to shine? What if there's nobody clapping hands for you? What if other people laugh at you? We can just be happy salted fish. It's pretty hot outside. It's really bright. We can be bright and hot together. After this dance, we are going to graduate from the school. I'll be here waiting for you. Mom. I've got to go. Go. Let's go. Let's help her. Hurry! Here we go! Hurry! Wait for me. I've seen the live show. What are you waiting for now? Go! Go! This is what it means to be young. Come on. A winner never needs to make a long speech. She's not talking to you. She's talking to you then? That's right. I'm her first love. That's quite straight forward. Where's my auntie? Auntie! Hey girl. The competition is over. What are you doing here? Hurry up. Get out of here. Come and get your costume! Go! Straw In The Breeze, we are never defeated! Straw In The Breeze, we are never defeated! Straw In The Breeze, we are never defeated! It turns out there really is seven-colored cloud here. Run through the summer We are invincible, right? What is rainbow? The light traveling to you Will all our silliness and dream come true? Shall we go and save the world? The words we shout out in the rain The people we have crush on Where are they going to be taken to? Are you afraid of growing up? We are straws We come from dirt Let's go Silly kids We need to light up our life With our ambition for the lifetime Sky And sea The summer of 18 years old Will it disappear? Do you like yourself After becoming an adult? Set up a bonfire in the crowd We sing loudly No matter how far away we are from each other We can always shout out to one another No matter where you are Are you going to remember the sky of shining youngsters? We are straws We come from dirt Let's go Wild kids Run away Open your arms Go against the breeze Let's fly Time to say goodbye to the summer Will you miss me? Time to say goodbye to the summer I'll miss you!
