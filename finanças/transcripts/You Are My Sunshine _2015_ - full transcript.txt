So you must remember this taste. Durian will remind you. Even If one day we're apart, you'll eat these sweets and think of me. You will think... that somewhere in the world... there is Zhao Mo Sheng... loving you so.

A businessman... An actor... and also, because of a recent big case... the now famous, He Yi Chen I think we've less chance with He Yi Chen. He's hard to get hold of. He won't accept media interviews here. He only accepts media interviews in America. His reason for refusing is quite odd. He says he's only willing to... be conspicuous in one place. Yi Chen! Excuse me. Yi Chen! Yi Chen! Yi Chen! Yi Chen! Yi Chen! You really attract attention. My phone's dead and I couldn't find you, so I made myself conspicuous so you'd find me. That's not daft.

I thought she was... going with you to America. It's okay, I can go on my own. Okay, you two brats I have to go. Can't you both let me go in peace? Zhao Mo Sheng I don't know where to drop you.

Stop the car! Yi Chen! It's your call. Don't fight! Let go of me! Let...let go! Why does everyone think I dumped you? First Xiao Xiao.. now your colleagues in the car think the same . It wasn't like that Why didn't you explain? Explain what? I think the same. How can you think that? That year we broke up, your father came to see me. It seems you didn't know. It was the first time I'd met him. My girlfriend was the mayor's daughter? He offered me terms to leave you. I'm sorry. If it's for your father, you needn't be or is it for yourself? So tell me... If you'd known about this, would you still have gone? At the time... I didn't know anything. Then why didn't you ask me? You didn't even ask me before sentencing me to death Zhao Mo Sheng do you know how much I hated you all those years? I'm sorry. So now... Do you want to come back to me? I'm sorry.

Go away I don't want to see you. Has something happened? If you won't go I'll go. Don't go! - I won't let you go - Zhao Mo Sheng! I wish I'd never met you. I Didn't think lawyers acted like that Having hissy fits when they're in a bad mood Back in university our dorm had a competition for a while Everyone bet on which girl would be the first to get Yi Chen Back then, there were lots of girls prettier and smarter than you, chasing Yi Chen. So you... Came as a complete surprise to us At first we weren't optimistic but gradually Yi Chen... began to turn into a normal 20 year old college kid. He would often be mad at you for washing everyone in the dorm's clothes... Xiang Heng! Did you ask me here to tell me this? You've been cruel enough. Go or not..it's up to you. I don't know what happened between you two. But.. Stop being so selfish. Acute stomach bleeding He has to stay for observation. His stomach's always been bad. Last time I went to his house... there was nothing in his refrigerator. so I took him to the supermarket. I never expected to meet you. As a child, his mother often told me. It would be great to have a daughter. So my mother said... she could have me in exchange. Oh well. Too bad. I can still remember Auntie. She went too soon. His parents... are both dead? Because of business problems... Uncle killed himself. He jumped off a high building. Auntie's health deteriorated And she died of a broken heart. Only you know about this. my parents were worried my brother would be upset if people knew and told me not to mention it. It was me that asked Xiang Heng to call you Mo Sheng When I was younger... I said those things to you. I know now. There are some battles you can't win. Kid's meals get these Give it to your brother. Mo Sheng although he's called He Yi Chen and I'm He Yi Mei. we're not really related. Actually, our families used to live next door to each other And as my father's name was He. we both have the same surname. When Yi Chen's parents died, our family adopted him. He and I are not actually blood relations. He never told me that Course not Do you think to him... you mean more than a childhood sweetheart of twenty years? But I'm his girlfriend. I just want to tell you I love Yi Chen. I don't want to love him secretly. I want to compete openly with you. Yi Chen... After you left for America... he started drinking heavily. You'll be graduating soon. There's so many girls chasing you. Why don't you find another girlfriend? Yi Mei! you'll understand later... Once that person appears in the world, Other people will only be a substitute And I don't want a substitute. Today is my birthday. Thank you for giving me the best birthday present For seven years. No other book could replace this one in his heart. Take it. It will put my mind at rest. Just remember I didn't lose to you... I only lost to him. He Yi Chen! I'm Zhao Mo Sheng. Zhao as in 'Zhao'.. Mo as in 'silent' Sheng..Sheng.. as in the instrument It's an allusion to Xu Zhi Mo's poem I love you so much. So I'm really afraid that you'll leave me or that you'll get sick and die. So you must remember this taste. Durian will make you remember Even if one day we're apart. you'll eat these sweets and think of me "Quietness is my farewell music Silent is Cambridge tonight” Yi Chen! Do you still want me? Let go. Want a drink? Say it. What are you here for? I went to see you in hospital. If you've come to visit a sick person you made a mistake, I'm not sick. If you want an affair... I don't. You don't. Don't say you're not married. That it was just an excuse to fend me off. Okay. then tell me. What do you want from me? To be your secret lover? To have an affair with you? Zhao Mo Sheng, let me tell you... don't even think it! I... He and I are divorced. I'm divorced. Zhao Mo Sheng! What makes you think I would want a divorced woman? - He and I weren't... - Enough! I Don't want to hear anything about you and you ex-husband. Sorry for disturbing you. Have you ever met someone? You still love her But you're so nervous. You daren't even touch her.

We'll be supple enough soon for the photographs to be taken I Want to ask you both something When a man and woman sleep together but the man doesn't... try anything, What does it mean? It must be that the woman is too ugly... Or perhaps, he's incapable... Or he's gay? It can't be any of those. Since ancient times bedding rituals... have been a performance art. Wearing costumes, always works. I'd be embarrassed buying such things. Stupid! Shop on-line Remember, you're using it as a tactic. Yes. Whoever has the weapons... calls the shots.

Hey! It's starting After block advertising my logo I had a dream. I dreamt ... those financial predators on Wall Street with money and power kept pestering me to launch my company. so they could invest I woke up and thought... "this is a sign" But after nearly a month I hadn't received a cent. One day, I ripped open an envelope and a cheque fell out. I just burst into tears I counted... how many... zeros there were... Two zeros It was 500 dollars. You'd give that to a beggar but that 500 dollars got me out of trouble and to where I am today. That was my first experience of business in America. Mr Ying! may I ask... are you married? Is there still a chance for us? I am married It was my wife... who gave me the 500 dollars that year. Yi Chen... I miss you. Sorry. Sorry The room booked is still occupied. Don't worry, I'll speak to the manager. Hey! Why speak to the manager? He's a friend of mine. I've just confirmed it. Hey! Classmates, come on.

You flatter me. Mr Ying is also very well known You're not curious... as to how I know of you? My ex-wife... often used the search engine I developed... to search for your name. It seems Mo Sheng never told you about me That's right. It wasn't important. Then you certainly... won't have seen this Nor long after Mo Sheng arrived in America she had trouble at home. For a long time... she lost her source of income... and was forced to break the school rules and get a part-time job. When she was at her most desperate she sent me an email to ask if I could give her back the 500 dollars she had originally given me. I had developed a keen interest in this particular girl and followed her for a time. Hi. Do you want a picture? - No thanks - Five dollars Five dollars? - Okay? - Thank you Okay. Five dollars Thank you. Five hundred dollars. I'm sorry, it's too... I'm Ying Hui. Five hundred dollars I don't want to carry 500 dollars. - Jack. Say Daddy - Daddy! Daddy! This is about the adoption We're here to investigate you. Can we have your co-operation, please? Sure. I know her name is Mo Sheng Zhao, an international student from China. Her landlady was locked up for assaulting her husband with a knife and left her boy with Sheng. The husband had a tendency for violence. We have the injury assessment report but Zhao is not legally qualified for adoption. Sheng voluntarily dropped out of school to work in order to provide for the son... Now, I'm helping her out What's your relationship with Sheng? Sheng is the one who founded my start-up company. I fell for her at first sight and was ready to propose. Sheng! will you marry me? ...and do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband? Yes, I do. And do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? I thought being with Zhao Mo Sheng was just pretend but I unwittingly fell for her. Jack's mother's been released from prison. You can offload the burden of us now. I'll get him another drink. One more orange juice please. - Yes - Thank you Jack. Come with Dad No. No...Please.. No.. Hey guy, what are you doing? This is my son. I'm taking him home. Don't shoot. He's got a gun! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! After surgery I was transferred in secret to a private hospital to recover Those two months were very happy because Mo Sheng was always at my side. Then I accidentally discovered that in her heart... was a name she had never forgotten. This music makes you feel good It's like... the feeling of first love This is my favorite song. Do you remember your first love too? If she saw you like this, she'd surely come back to you To see that I've really been shot? That person's gone from here. vanished In here... It's now vacant waiting for another person to move in Mo Sheng! are you willing to move in? Our marriage was in name only In almost three years that was the closest I got. But when I saw the expression in her eyes I knew... I'd never bridge that distance No way! I could only gamble on one last thing. This is the divorce agreement and this, is the prenuptial agreement. there's also an equity transfer agreement. Sign this and you will be the real Mrs Ying. Divorce Agreement You came to find me... just to tell me this story? I thought you would be curious. Sorry. It's getting late. Mo Sheng is at home drunk. I can't leave her alone too long. Big Lawyer He! my story may not interest you but I'm very interested in your story. For example... the matter between yours and Mo Sheng's parents... that happened over ten years ago. I suspect... even now, Mo Sheng... doesn't know the truth. Mr He! you're a lawyer Sometimes you have to keep secrets for your clients But your own secrets sometimes can't be... What do you want? Mo Sheng is a very simple girl I bet no-one in this world... is as stupid as her. waiting seven years for a relationship... you'd better not have an ulterior motive for being with her Zhao Mo Sheng is my wife, don't worry Mr Ying! you should be more confident and stick to your own area of expertise. Here's my business card. if you ever need a lawyer you can always call me. Waiter! Get me another bottle and some roasted peanuts. I'm sorry, sir we don't provide those. Wait. Wait. I'll see what we can do. Yi Chen! why are you crying? I always thought in the past few years it was you who got lost. I didn't know until today that actually it was me. I'm so sorry I wasn't with you all those years. If I'd known how much you would suffer there's no way I'd have let you go. Soon after arriving in America... Dad had an accident. I never realized that he'd been planning his escape. Dad had given me a lot of money but I thought it was that money that killed him. I went to the Consulate and asked them to donate it to good causes. I preferred to work illegally off campus I thought this would help Dad. but Aunt Per telephoned me... Your Dad's committed suicide. Don't return to china. Don't ever come home again... and remember... who you can and can't contact You have money. Make a life for yourself in America. For a long time afterwards I had the same nightmare. No food... No place to live... I stood alone on the street crying and no one even looked at me. Don't Mo Sheng, don't talk about it You'll never have that life again. I swear. Now, thinking about the things I didn't want to think about before. I don't seem to feel as sad. You have me. Come in. Mr He, a lady's here saying she must see you today. Show her in. You left the restaurant in such haste I didn't think you'd remember me Of course. Mrs Zhao. Mo Sheng... isn't my own daughter. and before her father's death he came to me for a divorce... so I could leave safely. I did my best to take care of and protect his daughter. You don't need to tell me this. You seem hostile towards me. Really? You're probably over-sensitive. Mr He! you're young and talented. I don't know what your parents do for a living and haven't had a chance... to get to know them. Let me also take on the responsibility of a parent. I have to disappoint you. My parents are dead. Was it from illness? When are you going to stop pretending? Why don't you ask me directly? Do I know my father's death... was caused by your husband Zhao Qing Yuan? You knew about it? Then why did you marry Xiao Sheng? For revenge? That's between me and Mo Sheng. I don't need to explain to you. How can I trust you? It's up to you. Does Xiao Sheng know about this? She doesn't know about it. You plotted this deliberately. Compared to you and Zhao Qing Yuan back then... I'm still an amateur. Your father's death... was an accident. and the loan was covered by insurance Xiao Sheng's father had nothing to do with it. Zhao Qing Yuan was a banker then Not only did he change the term for repayment of the loan for the construction... when the loan couldn't be repaid he proceeded to ruin the owner of the construction company. Your father slipped and fell. He killed himself! Did you know? That year, I watched my father jump from the top floor of the building he had built himself and watched my mother follow in my father's footsteps and die. All thanks to you and your husband, Zhao Qing Yuan Let's put all our cards on the table. Tell me your conditions... What do you want to let Xiao Sheng go? You're not the first one to ask me that Seven years ago... Zhao Qing Yuan asked me the same thing. At the time, I didn't know... my girlfriend was the daughter of my enemy. I know. We had no choice. So... You got your revenge through the newspapers. Did you have to marry Xiao Sheng? I had my parents for ten years. I want Mo Sheng for a lifetime. I've given in to the sunshine Mo Sheng's imagination sometimes runs wild Please don't ever let her know. Aunt Pei. this is the promise I want from you. Yi Chen! Aunt Pei! That year... Yi Chen took me back to America. He said he wanted to go with me to the place where for seven years, I'd been alone Slow down I used to work on this boat but at that time it went to Alcatraz. Really? I've been there You went there in a dream? Hi! Mo Sheng! Hi! Hi I've just seen a friend, I'll say hello What kind of friend? He pursued me Hi. It's actually you. I can't believe you're still here. What are you doing here? Travelling. Actually... you never said goodbye, so... I kept this photo of you all these years. I want to stay here two more days. I haven't found her yet. You came to find me in America? Didn't you? You guessed. "Why is the earth round?” " To allow lost lovers to meet again”
