What has happened? The worst. What do you mean? Well, yes... I don't know, it's weird. I just do things and... I don't think about anything... And I make mistakes, a lot. - Are you angry? - What? - Are you angry? - No. - I thought. - No. It's great that Marce is back, right? Doesn't make you happy? It's normal. Well... It wasn't a long time. Two months, also she didn't write or appear all this time! Two months is nothing. In two months a lot things can happen. - A lot of things? - I don't know. - Dude... - What? This is horrible. What? So everything is horrible? Do you like something in this kitchen? Are you sure? Take a look. I'm coming. I'll send it. Bye. Seriously? - Hello. - Baby, you're late. What happen? Don't you feel anything? Half an hour late. What happened? Nothing, I have to do a lot of things. But I'm here. Well, thanks. I'm sorry. What can I offer you, madam...? President of Chapinero? Town councillor! Madam, what do you want to drink? I can offer you a mimosa and also a mimosa... And poisoned orange juice. It's awful. You gonna work here? I have a dinner and my friends are angry. But I finish it and I'll send it. - Hello! - Hello! All good? Hello! Everything's fine? What a pretty house! Pretty, right? You can't imagine the huge traffic jam! The fruit is washed? Don't start. You're finished your work? - Where is Marce? - She hasn't arrived. Has she answered you? She hasn't answered me in two months. - She said she was coming. - Right, but I don't know... So unfriendly, right? But she wanted to disconnect, why do you say that? Normal. Do you think it’s normal to leave overnight for two months? Right? - Fuck! Is Marce! - Marce! Marce is here! Fuck!!! Motherfucker! Two months! I'm going to cry. Let's toast! Diana, you drank the mimosa. For Marce! Go on! Because we are together again. Seriously, I really missed you. The twins... It’s been a while since we were all five together. Marce, let each one serve, right? - And what? - Of what? How did you go? How so? How it went? I don’t understand the question. - Don’t you understand the question? - No. You're asking me, how it went? How it went? Yes, I want to know. It went really good. I had a great time. But, how did it go? Alright, I'm sorry... I know... We’re not gonna talk again? Seriously... What do you want me to say? I was nervous too, it was the first thing I did, I don’t know... Please, forgive me. It seems that you don't size things. It’s freezing in this house. My feet are frozen. Really, Ana? Alcohol in the table? What's up? How about Europe? - Great? - Yes. You're very international. You’re a host of an international channel, you were in Europe, she with her Argentine boyfriend. Very good. You with a book with international sales... Yeah, too! 'Leading Ladies', that title what? 'Leading Ladies' Yes, where did it come from? Actually, it was my editor, I never... I don’t believe you. Really? Who knows what a weird thing is 'Leading Ladies'. Each one is the protagonist of their lives, that's why. Tell us about your journey. Why it's all about my journey? I'll show you later. We are here for you! I want to know what happened while I was away, too. Lot of things, but tell us your first. I’m teaching painting classes to children. She’s done very well and they love her. Juan knows how to cook? What do you think? He makes a delicious meat. - Only barbecue. - Barbecue. Yes, it’s like a cliche, that Argentines know how to prepare meat. And it’s true. Good... The best is the chorizo. - Delicious. - Interesting. It's awful. No, but you're doing fine... I can't think about being mayor, I have to work hard first. But are you thinking about it? I find it very interesting, but... - You deserve it. - Everything has a time. Yeah, I’ve really worked hard. - But good... - No, that's so boring. Too much work. - You are slave to that shit. - But she likes it. I want to know, how is the relationship between a president and a school teacher? Or kindergarden? Sorry, kindergarden. - How is it? - Very particular. What are you talking about? - Normal things. - We don't talk much. You don't talk much? After 80 years, are you still like rabbits? Tell me! She says, "Love, this morning Martin, the three-year-old boy painted a very cute rabbit, but looked like a dog". Do you think that I speak like that? "Do you think that I speak like that?" - Obviously not. - "Obviously not". "Obviously not". Really, answer me! You keep talking. - What are you talking about? - The usual. - We talk about the day... - "About the day..." "Today was a catastrophe in the kindergarden, because Pedrito shitted his pants, and there were no replacement pants". "Really, everything was shit. My life sucks". She needs that... I ask, you have to know how to paint, and want to be a great painter, to teach a three-year-old to paint? What are you trying to say, because I don’t understand. Well, those kids paint, they make... They express themselves, is free expression... - It's to expose creativity. - Exactly. They must have another vision. Not so hermetic of life and art. And no, I’m not a professional painter. And why not? I’m in that process. You’ve been in that process since we’ve known you. I had that doubt. I’m saying that she never gives herself credit for anything. - She does it very well... - Stop it. She’s educating the children of this country, which I think is important from an artistic vision. And we talk about things like you can talk to Juan, or you with Marcos, or whatever. - Normal things. - Normal. The thing is, I talk with a dick in my mouth. How do you do? One more time, please. When Juan comes home... I can’t imagine you, so gross. How long has it been since you’ve had oral sex with a man? Since they are together. Well, maybe she had a slip at some point. The topic of conversation at dinner. - She's talking with her lover. - Shut up. She doesn’t pay attention to you so you’ve obviously had a lover, because if you’re with a woman who’s working all day. You know what? Yes, I know. - You know what? - That she has a lover. She has a lover and you know it? Do you allow it? She's happy. - You? - What? - Do you have a lover? - No, I'm faithful. I'm very faithful. You can tell. You're annoying today. - Yeah! - No! - Yes! - Yes! - I don't remember anything! - You're the best of all. - You were the best of all. - Yes. - Please! - No! Please? Please? And you pull us out of this moment of density. We didn't sing it for a long time. About ten years ago! Go on. I love it. Here it goes. I’ll get ready. ♪ If you were born in a country ♪ Where everything is so gray ♪ What the hell am I doing here? ♪ No, I won't let myself beat ♪ Even you see me fall ♪ I’ll fuck you in the ass ♪ I’m not weak, I’ll fight for my dreams ♪ I swear, I'm the best ♪ Where you are, I’ll be there ♪ We’re all gonna break it ♪ Even though she’s fucked up.

What are you laughing? I don't understand anything. I liked women since I was little. The things that I have clear. And... And I hope with my knowledge to do something... for me and for the people. You said: "The things that I have clear". I sense then, there are things that you're not clear about? Well...yes. I think lately... I think there are things that... that I thought were defined, or what I thought that had to be, that maybe don't have to be. Yes, I'll make it. I'll send it. You're in home. Love, really? Look at the hour. I'm sorry. I don't understand anything, seriously. Half an hour late. - What happened? - I did what I could. Nothing. Things you don't like me talking about. I have to finish something and I'll join you. You're gonna work here? It's a small thing. Really? Yes. What can I offer you, madam...? What are you now? - President of Chapinero? - President... Town councillor! What can I offer you? No, nothing. Keep up what you are doing. - Raul, the last proposal... - A corkscrew! ...it must be reassessed, because in the last... Hello! What does it mean? Make the house look nice. Thank you. - How are you? - I'm fine. Here with the ladies. Hello! It's a very particular flower. - What a pretty house! - The ones you like. You can't imagine the huge traffic jam! Really? - Can I look at the house? - Of course. Here, it looks good. You already have. But not like this. Cheers! Diana Patricia! That's it. She's working? Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Make a parade! Why did you mess her up? - I took off my hat. - I like your new look. You're beautiful. Did Marcela answer you in this two months? - Because she don't answered me. - No, nothing. She just said, "I'm going". - I thought she wasn't coming. - Very brief. I wanted to disconnect myself. For Marce! Welcome back. I didn't learn to speak French. - How so? - This wine is delicious. Will you help me to serve? Yes, of course. - Juan is so insecure. - Why? I don't know. You and Juan have been together a long time. Wait, first I'm going to do something... Yes, I can imagine what you're going to do. Clean the cutlery, you don't know. And the conscience. When you are a politician... I have nothing to hide, vote for me. As if she were in campaign, I want to know, what people feel about Diana? - She inspires me. - What inspires you? - She inspires me security. - What security? Security because she will lead us to the future, to progress! What future, what progress? - Cultural! - Cultural! - Of education! - Yes! - Great! - Bravo, Diana! Bravo... I want everyone to do like this... Diana! - In the campaign... - That can't be. - Which campaign? - They made me take off everything. I'm with some friends that I haven't seen in while. - I’ll repeat, will you repeat? - Go ahead. - Penne, always! - Well... A boyfriend? I'm not understanding anything. Let's talk tomorrow. Really? ♪ No, I won't let myself beat ♪ Even you see me fall ♪ I’ll fuck you in the ass ♪ I’m not weak, I’ll fight for my dreams ♪ Vote for Diana, she's the best! ♪ Where you are, I’ll be there ♪ We’re all gonna break it. ♪ Even though this fucked up. Diana, the change is now! And the photo looking to the future. I’m going out for a while. Why didn’t you eat? Don’t you eat much lately? - No, maybe is stress. - You have no appetite? - Maybe the campaign? - Maybe work? No, you have to eat. Maybe the relationship? Are you eating clam? That worries me. Are you worried about my clam life? No, I'm worried about your diet. How you doing on that? - Are you anorexic, bulimic? - I'm at low tide. Because there is high tide at work. How is that? They don't have sex. I won’t go into details, but I have a lot of work. But maybe that will relax you... Yes, totally. People say that orgasms are very good to be... - To set you free. - ...to be happy. For woman to be happy. But you look sad. I hadn't thought... I had not talked about this. I'm so wet. Take care. Asshole. Marce, how was your journey? It was incredible. - Really? - Yes, it was incredible. What a delight, traveling. For quite a long time I wanted to know... Where you were? I was in Lisbon, at a music festival, after that I went to Madrid... Diana... Are you ok? Yes, I'm fine. I'm going out. - I'm going out. - Ok. Diana told me that she knew everything. That they all knew everything. But she didn't tell you everything. What happened to you? What happened to us. What happened? Do something, help me wash that. Help you to wash? I don't touch that shit. No way. I put water in it, that's all. Who's here? I open the door. I open the door and you finish what you are doing. - Hello! - Hello! - Marce? - Marce? - Good? - I'm fine and you? - Welcome. - Thank you. What a pretty house! You can't imagine the huge traffic jam! - Can I look at the house? - Of course. The table is dirty with... parmesan cheese. We clean up later. Be careful, I have germs! Silvia, don't! That's disgusting! - What's your problem? - That's disgusting! "That's disgusting!" Sit down for a while. I don't know what drug that woman took. I didn't take anything, I wish I had taken something. - That's disgusting. - "That's disgusting!" The bread! Has anyone talked with Marce? No. - She hasn't answered me in two months. - She said she was coming. She said she was coming, but she hasn't answered me in two months. - Are we doing this for her? - Obviously... Marce is here! Oh my God! She's crying? So crazy. We haven’t been together in a long time. I love it! - And the movie? - What movie? - The....the... - What movie? The thing you are doing. - The book! - The book! What happened with that? - All good... - Good, I'm famous! We are with a famous woman, but nothing more. Hey, what about your job? Did you work today or not? - No, not today. - Today you didn't work? - And why? - Yes, she didn't work today. What do I smell like? Nothing! What do I smell like? When you go to work, you smell like a "fresh". - This is my plate. - Ok. I can't forget this. How to forget those special details? Antiseptics. I know that for people, this is weird. No, it's ok. It's for health, I take care of myself. Ana, alcohol in the table? - Do you want? - No... I already washed my hands. You're very international. - International? - Yes, Europe... - International channel... - Yes. And your book translated into how many languages? Marce, how many languages are you translating your book? Obviously first in English. Polish. - What? - I didn't know. I mean, 'Leading Ladies'... Cheers for that. The book! Cheers for the book! Yes, I congratulate you. 'Leading Ladies', that title what? You should eat, it's very tasty. I eat chorizo in silence, sometimes you make some comments that I don't ... - Ok. - What did I miss? They fight all the time. Really? Ana Maria's memory lane. Fuck me!

I love it! You know how my life has been since I entered college, and what I've had to do. And I started... to work with some people... first was with a guy, as an escort. And that money helped me to pay for college, to live... for many things. Things everyone had and I didn't. Things that you had, and for you they were easy to have, but not for Silvia and for me. And you know what? It wasn't my fault. But there is something that does make me feel very bad. And it's you. I'm sorry. Silvia! Silvia! I feel that I'm not consistent with what I really want. Yes, I feel like I'm doing something wrong. - Do you judge yourself? - Yes. And if you start now, to be consistent? They are all liars. They were all hiding things, they all started to treat each other very badly, I can't believe that everything ends like this. All blaming each other, they can’t take their own shit. I don't know if they knew what I was up to. But... as if they were pretending that everything was okay, at first, and then everything fucked up. Marce is here! Open the door! Asshole! Cheers! Asshole! You're very pretty! You're very pretty! Thank you. Marce... Listen! This woman was dying without you. She was dying. Yes, really! Let's toast. Ok. Madam president, you're requested at the reception. Town councillor. Thank you. It’s been a while since we were all five together. - I missed you so much. - Cheers. - Welcome, Marce. - Thank you. It's a very finest wine. It's delicious. - Must be aguardiente. - A cigarette? Ok. Love, can you help me with... How did you go? How so? Don’t you understand the question? Really? You're asking me, how it went? Yes, I want to know. No, everything good. It went really good. You know the shit I had to go through? Because of you! And that's it? Sorry? No, it wasn't just that. It wasn't just that? At that time I couldn't tell you. - Now I can tell you. - What? I needed some money, ok? I needed some money. For Silvia. For Silvia? Yes, she asked me some money and I took it from there, I had nowhere else. All that happened at that moment, I got scared, I took the money and I left. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. This moment is very uncomfortable. You can't imagine... what it's like to be in jail, you have no idea. Take it easy. Together we could have thought a solution. What would we have done? - Tell me! - I don't know. I don't know, but something smarter. I couldn't think clearly, you know me. - I'm so sorry. - You could talk. How could I tell her? You want everyone to know? - No. - Stop crying. Don't tell me to stop crying! - I calmed down. - Sorry. I'm so sorry! Wait a minute! - Why do you have red eyes? - What? - Marcela, look at me! - She's tired. Yes, it's edible. Let's serve. Wait, I have to clean my plate. - It's hard. - You like it hard? - I like it hard. - Ana also likes it hard. Ana, really? Alcohol in the table? - Do you want? - I already washed my hands. We have to give a... Silvia, so gross! Not seriously! - You like the drool. - Shut up! Take her hand. Jesus our lord, thank you for bringing Marcela back. That's disgusting! And for this big penis. Get off me! So gross! Fuck! I'm to wet! Really? Your book was translated, right? How many languages? - Like a thousand! - Too much. Starting with the title. Yes, that title what? 'Leading Ladies' - Water? - Yes. - Relax, I serve it. My editor picked it. - I knew it. - What? Each one is the protagonist of their lives. - Wow. - Sometimes I'm smart. You haven't told me about your journey. Why do you avoid that all the time? - How so I evaded? - The topic. Are we gossiping too much? I want to know, tell us everything. I knew the Eiffel Tower. - I've always wanted to go. - Everyone knows it. He proposed to you at the Eiffel Tower? No... - Did you go up? - Yes. Me too, it's super cool. How did you get up? - Very good. - How did you get up? By elevator. Cool. I propose a toast for Marce's welcome! - Welcome. - Cheers! ♪ If you were born in a country - I love it! - No! - Yes! - Who is going to improvise? - I want this! No!!! Please!!! I want to listen the international! Marce!!! Give me something. Let's be silent for a minute. ♪ If you were born in a country ♪ Where everything is very gray ♪ What the hell am I doing here? ♪ No, I won't let myself beat ♪ Even you see me fall ♪ I’ll fuck you in the ass ♪ I’m not weak, I’ll fight for my dreams ♪ I swear, I'm the best ♪ Where you are, I’ll be there ♪ We’re all gonna break it ♪ Even though I'm fucked up. How do you remember that shit! The memory lane. Do you remember that group of girls who were so jealous of us? Marce and I were together all the time and they couldn't handle it. I remember when you were straight. Me too!!! - Long time ago. - I'm gonna meditate a little. Go ahead. Meditation is for open and great minds, it's very important, - What is the chakra? - The chakra? - The third eye? - Yes, that's important. - The intuition eye. - The eye to activate. What's happening here? Private party or what? What's going on? - What's going on? - I have a cramp. What cramp? - Silvia, come here. - What? Come here, I have to tell you something. - What? - Just a moment. - What? - Of what? What about Ana? I don't know, what happened with Ana? What's your problem? What's wrong? What happens? No!!! - What? - Dude! What the fuck! What? You borrowed money from Ana Maria? - Sometime? - No... What? She told me that you needed money. Me? I don't know, sometime. No. What happened? Swear you won’t get mad at me. These two months, I was not traveling. I did a business with Ana. And she got me in trouble. I don't know what she did, she took some money. And they got caught, she scammed someone, I don't know who. Marce? Don't touch me. What do you want? I'm so sorry... Silvia didn't need money. Why are you such a liar? I was two months in jail. Marce... listen to me. - Listen to me. - Shut up. Let me talk to her. - Shut up! - Go away! Go away! Go away! What do you think will happen after tonight? I don't know. I don't know. You know, I don't feel... There comes a point when you’re so guilty, that you stop feeling it. Or becomes normal and you live with it. Then, you don’t feel it anymore. I'm not asking you if you feel it or not. I asked you, what is guilt. When you hate yourself. Do you hate yourself? No. Do you hate yourself? I love you. I love you. They’ll be here soon. Someone will be here. - They are going to arrive. - Stop it! No more. What? Why are we doing this? You tell me. Because we love each other. Because we like each other. Why not? Why don’t we do it for real? I'm serious. Don't fuck with me. You did it before. Stop it. I want to be with you. - Really? - It's true. How many times have you told me that? - That's it. - Ok. Are you angry? Are you angry? It's great that Marce is back, right? Doesn't make you happy? Well, I don't know... It was only two months. Two months? In two months many things can change. Feel at home, go ahead. Go ahead! It's very good, it's a proposal called San Francisco, to be done in Chapinero. There will be new entrepreneurs, some SMEs, and I think it's very good. And it wasn't approved, so... I understood you like this... Maybe there would be a place for your book. - For my book? - Why not? I say it because there will be writers, some bands... - Leave that... - Yes, but the thing is... I'm almost done. You were half an hour late. You didn’t help me with dinner... Fuck! - Fuck! Is Marce! - Marce! What a pretty house! - Hello! - Hello! - How are you? - I'm fine. You can't imagine the huge traffic jam! Cheers! - And Juan? - Good. - Very good. - You have been together quite a while. Yes, a lot, you're right. - I think we're getting married. - Seriously? Yes, he's great. They're getting married! We haven't talked about it, but I do see my future with him. Do you want to get married? Well, like you two, I would like to have something like that. Marce is here! Fuck! No, we don't receive homeless people today. Welcome! How are you? I like your new look. You're very pretty. Europe did you good. I got sentimental. Cheers! I love you. I love you. I want to be with you. How many times have you told me that? ♪ If you were born in a country ♪ Where everything is very gray ♪ What the hell am I doing here? ♪ No, I won't let myself beat ♪ Even you see me fall ♪ I’ll fuck you in the ass ♪ I’m not weak, I’ll fight for my dreams ♪ I swear, I'm the best ♪ Where you are, I’ll be there ♪ We’re all gonna break it ♪ Even though I'm fucked up Very good, very good. We would have done well if we had studied music. Cheers! Kiss! Don't be so sweet. But... I want to know about Ana. It was very cool, very nice. Don't do that. Don't do that! Stop making that noise! - It's to prepare the party. - Shut up. Don't be annoying, shut up! You have cigarettes? - In the bag? - Yes. Everything was delicious. I’ll do the digestion, with a cigarette. You're so annoying. Will you do nothing? Will you do nothing? Be gentle. Fuck! What? - Come here! - They’re gonna see us! - Oh no! - What? What? Would you mind if they saw us? Ok, ok... You’re so in love with Diana, right? - It's true. - Shut up. You’re so in love with her. I'm only to have sex, right? You don't have sex with her like you do with me. Is that, right? Someone is coming. What if they come? No one is coming. - You hurt me. - What did I do to you? What did I do to you? I want no more. Fuck! They saw us! - What she's doing? - I don’t see anything. Fuck! Maybe she didn't see. - What's happening here? - What? She didn't see anything. Calm down. What? - I have to tell you something. - What? - Come here. - What? - What? - What's going on? What were you doing? What were you doing? That's too much! - It's strong. - It's good. What were you doing? Asshole! I’ll ask Ana Maria the hand sanitizer. What? What? I wasn't traveling. Why didn't you tell me? Before you got in trouble. - Because... - Why? Because I didn’t want to bother anyone. But it was for money, why didn't you tell me? Marce, I feel bad. I'm sorry. Ana, I don't understand. - What? - What's your game? I don't understand, I don't understand you two what? I don’t understand what you’re doing with Diana... If you two love each other, why are you not together? I don't know, ask her. - She doesn’t want to. - Why she doesn’t want? She left me. She left me once. Didn't you tell her? Yes, I tell her everything. But I'm scared. - Of what? - Of what? She left me once. I told her yes and she left. She’ll do it again. Seven years ago, seven years. - How you doin'? - All good. - What happened to you? - Nothing. - Aren't you cold out here? - A little. Let's go into the house. - Ah? - Let's go into the house? - Or we stay out here? - Silvia... Come here. - Let's go all. - No. Do you want to be with her? I... I hadn’t told anyone, but... I was thinking of leaving, anyway. Our relationship isn't working. Well, she... I wasn’t going to be there anymore. I’d rather she be with you. Is there something I should know? She and I, we no longer love each other. Love... Come... come here. Let's talk. You have to know, let us explain. I'm sorry. This is important. Everything is fine, I saw you with her as I've never seen you with me. Is time to stop this ... and do what you want. And that's it. I have nothing to do here, I have nothing to do there, so, that's it. Just that. I'm sorry. Diana... We didn't want to hurt you. If there’s anything I should know, just tell me. I was first. I... I was very nervous, when I gave you the first kiss, and you’d already kissed, I thought it was the first time. What a stupid thing! No, it’s not stupid. Yes, it's a stupid thing! What a stupid thing. I never knew how to tell you. Bitches. No, no, how I didn't realize about you two. Really... I understand many things, What? My time has come. Hey! Baby, I'm sorry. It’s once in a lifetime. For once in my life I have to do something different, right? Change. No, no, this is not real. - No, no. - What I have to do? Open your mouth. Suck the finger. I'm so naive. I’m always late for things. No more, please. Please...I'm the worst. What are you doing? Nothing. Marcela, what did you do? Of what? Me too and I didn't know how. Give more to Marcela! I don't remember why we are friends. Sometimes you need to be pushed to live your life. This seems like a goodbye and I don't know if I care. Life is simpler than it seems. This is not going to work. These two months, I was not traveling. I love you. Why don’t we do it for real? What happened to us? It’s been a while since we were together. You're gonna kill me... I was thinking of leaving, anyway. Why don’t we do it for real? What do you feel? I'm fine. What is guilt for you? It’s the consequence of a decision. Now you feel guilty? Right now? No. No, I don’t feel guilty about anything. I mean, I did feel a little, but... but now... I feel happier than guilty. - Happier than guilty? - Yes. Like...uff! Like... When you think things are... ...impossible...well... if you get rid of that guilt... it's no longer impossible. And... And it feels great. The movie you just saw is an improvisation.
