(male narrator) Los Angeles. Four hundred and fifty four square miles of city. Estimated population, two million.. One hundred thousand. The story you are about to see actually happened to one.. Of those two million one hundred thousand people. It could happen to you. These men are bank examiners. All honest, all hardworking. Each man, a trained auditor. This man's name is Tate. He couldn't possibly be interested in our bank examiners. Or could he? A bank manager never knows just when a crew of Federal Bank examiners will call on you. This morning for instance, these experts are commencing their examination of an important branch of the Capitol National Bank. [engine revving] This is the Hollywood branch of the Capitol National Bank. A hub in the business wheel of a community in which it's located. Almost 9:30 and the bank employees are getting ready for the day's business. This man is Michael Donovan. Respected citizen. Discharged war veteran and chief teller for the Hollywood branch of the Capitol National Bank. His day is started like any other day. Well planned, orderly, routine. Nothing unusual about it. [engine revving] And here are the bank examiners. On time as usual. They will go through those doors and begin their days work. Just as orderly, just as routine... and usual. As Michael Donovan's. And Mr. Tate arrives right on time too. [instrumental music] That is... usual, except for one thing. This morning, eleven bank examiners show up at a bank.. Where only ten are supposed to call. [music continues] The eleventh man? He's Mr. Tate. The chief deputy allocates half his men. Each man goes to his previously assigned post. This man is the branch manager. His name is Starling. Remaining men go to their posts and the day's work begins. Thorough, quick. [music continues] The examiners first step is a spot check of all the cash the tellers have on hand. A chief teller handles as much as $150,000 in ready cash at one time. A lot of money. But a teller is bounded and dependable. It's Friday, April 10th. 9:45 a.m. Tomorrow is Saturday and the bank is closed. 10 o'clock. The bank is open for business. Hundreds of people will pass through these doors between the hours of 10:00 and 3:00. [instrumental music] Examiners go right on checking their cash. Mr. Tate.. He goes on doing... whatever he's doing. [dramatic music] [music continues] Thank you very much. I want to recheck your big money. Help yourself. I wonder if you could help me. I'm sorry. What can I do for you, miss? I'd like to open an account. I'm afraid I can't help you with that. You'll have to go to the "New Accounts Desk." That's the front off the building. [dramatic music] (Vera) 'Well, I'm in such a terrible hurry' 'and I'm already late for work.' Couldn't you break the rules? Just this once? I-I'm sorry, miss, all new accounts have to go through that department. Checked out okay, thank you. Don't mention it. Sorry. Well, if you can't then I guess you can't. I have to come back later. Sorry to have troubled you. - Pleasure. - Thank you. Persistent, wasn't she? - Hi, Mike. - Good morning, Kitty. [dramatic music] (male narrator) It was as easy and as simple as that. Mr. Tate walked into the safest place in the world to keep money, a national bank.. And walked out with almost $50,000. And a man's future. Michael Donovan's future. [glass rattling] No, I'm sorry. It's ten minutes after. I'm sorry. No. [typewriter keys clanking] Glad that's over again. You haven't been a penny short for five years. Yeah, but you never can tell. There's always the first time. Yeah, I guess so. Forty nine thousand dollars short. I must be losing my mind. - What did you say? - Hm? Uh, nothing, nothing. [typewriter keys clanking] Is there anything wrong? Uh, no. Nothing. Goodnight, Mike. Have a nice weekend. Oh, m-mister.. [dog barking] (male narrator) A $49,900 shortage. Somewhere, somehow, there's an answer. Things like this just don't happen to a man. But it has happened to you, Michael Donovan. You can put it off till Monday. But Monday morning will come so terribly soon. Better tell your wife, Ruth. Get it off your chest. Tell me what's bothering you. Well.. My cash didn't balance yesterday. Is that all? Where did you go wrong? I don't know. You don't know? Well, how much were you short? Forty nine thousand, nine hundred dollars. - You're joking. - $49,000 is no joke, Ruthie. Why that's impossible! - How could you? - I don't know! I just don't know. [whispers] Thanks. What did Mr. Starling say when you reported it? I haven't reported it yet. - Oh, Mike, you should have. - I know I should have, Ruthie. But I wanted time to think. I-I.. What's there to think about? When you're short, you've got to report it. But Ruthie, I, uh.. First thing tomorrow morning. Alright. First thing tomorrow morning. [birds chirping] Good morning. Oh, good morning, Mr. Donovan. Good morning, Mrs. Donovan. - Good morning, Sam. - It's a fine day! Makes you glad you're out.. [indistinct chattering] - Mr. Starling? - 'Come in, Mike.' (Starling) 'Hello, Ruthie. Mornin', Mike.' I've got to talk to you, Mr. Starling. Sit down. I'll be with you in a second. Sit down, Mike. Now, then. What can I do for you? Mr. Starling, my cash didn't balance on Friday. Oh? Why didn't you come to me then? I just couldn't believe it had happened. I still can't believe it. Well, we've straightened these things out together before.. I know, but $49,900.. Oh, there's nothing that can't be.. Forty nine thousand, nine hundred dollars? Mr. Starling, it must be in the bank somewhere.. - 'It's got to be.' - Ruthie, please. Let me handle this. How could you possibly be short all that money? I just don't know, I checked and I rechecked and it always came up the same. This is preposterous. Did anyone come into your cage during the day? No, well, Georgia, Ms. Hoard came in to get change for some big bills. And the bank examiners. They were around all day. Nobody else? No, sir. Mike, I've known you for a long time. - I trust you. - Thank you, sir. But was very bad judgment not to report the loss immediately. I know it was. But I... Mr. Starling, what are we going to do? Well, there's only one thing we can do. Call the Bonding Company in the downtown office right away. [engines revving] [intercom buzzing] Yes? (female #1) 'Mr. Starling calling, Mr. Temple.' - Put him on, please. - 'Yes, sir.' Jim! How are you, boy? Pretty good, Frank. Wife, family okay? Fine, fine, everybody's fine. Uh, look, Frank. I have some bad news for you. Well, let's hear it. It can't be too bad. I'm afraid it is. One of my tellers showed up with a $49,900 shortage last Friday. - What? Well, you're kidding! - 'No, I'm not.' Last Friday? Well, why didn't you call us then? Well, because he just reported it this morning. 'Well, what's his name?' Michael Donovan. Donovan, eh? Okay, Jim. I'll get a man right over there. And don't let Donovan out of your sight. I'm sure he's alright, Frank. [chuckles] I'm sure you're sure. - Watch him, anyhow. - 'Alright, Frank. Goodbye.' Right. - 'Yes?' - Gus Slavin come in yet? - 'Just walked in, Mr. Temple.' - Ask him to come in please. Right away, Mr. Temple. Boss wants you. Thanks, honey. Good morning, Mr. Temple. Gus, I want you to get right over to the Hollywood branch of the Capitol Bank. Trouble? One of the tellers just reported a $49,900 shortage. His name is Donovan. You can take it from there. Okay, I'm on my way. Don't worry, sir. Nobody heists 49,900 from us. - Nobody. - I hope you're right. I know I'm right. Be seeing you. It's all kind of silly. Don't you think, Donovan? - Hmm? What do you mean? - You know what I mean. Oh, look here.. I'd like to see Mr. Donovan alone if you don't mind. Of course not. You can use the conference room. Sit down. Tell you what, why don't we make it quick? Who did you sell the dough to? I don't know what you're talking about. But you shoved it to somebody. Now who was it? Look, I-I told you, I don't know anything about it except that the money is gone. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Some young lady maybe? She conned you into it? Can't you understand? I don't know anything about it! - Want a cigarette? - No, thanks. Come on, go ahead. I said, no thanks. Look, you're just making it tough on yourself. If you weren't working with someone else you've hidden the dough somewhere. But you get this, you're never gonna spend a dime of that money. 'Cause from this moment on, I'm gonna be right on your tail. You gotta good reputation, Donovan. Don't let one mistake, mess it up. All I'm interested in, is getting the money back. Now you just tell me where it is and nothing happens to ya. But you be stubborn about it and you get everything that I can throw at ya. Look, if I had taken that money, do you think I would have walked into this bank, this morning and stuck my head in a trap? Oh, why don't you stop it? If you hadn't, you'd reported the loss before you walked out of here on Friday. I wanted time to think. I was confused! You wanted time to hide it! - That's a lie! - Sit down. You think you're clean now, don't you, pal? All you have to do, is dummy up and sit and wait. No, no, I-I.. But you made one big mistake, mister. Clipping a Federal Bank is a big error. But I didn't do it! That means that the FBI will be in on it. Even you know that the FBI and the cops don't make deals. I can. There's no deal to make. Look, why don't we try this just one more time before I take you down to police headquarters. Where's the dough? I don't know. Okay, mister. Come on, let's go. [instrumental music] (male narrator) It's frightening how fast a man's life can change in two short days. Friday, April 10th, Michael Donovan went to work as usual. Just like anybody else. Monday, April 13th he's in the Hollywood precinct in the Los Angeles police department under suspicion of grand theft. With a sick, hopeless feeling right in the middle of his stomach. Sometimes, there just doesn't seem to be an answer to anything. One day, the world's alright. The next, it's nowhere. Where's the money? You're from the FBI why don't you tell me? Why didn't you take your big money back to the vault? - After the examiner checked it? - I was busy. You first missed the money at 3 o'clock? (Donovan) 'Yeah.' 'Right after the bank closed.' How was it that you didn't miss it before that? I don't know, I was busy, I just didn't check it. Forty-nine thousand, nine hundred's a pretty big score. Takes a pretty smart guy to figure a heist like that. (Donovan) 'Yeah, I guess so.' You a pretty smart guy, Donovan? Smart enough not to try a trick like that. Your husband pretty much in debt, Mrs. Donovan? No. Not anymore than anybody else these days. But you do owe money. Well, yes. Doesn't everybody? How much? Oh, I don't know offhand. The house, the car, some clothes. How much? I don't know exactly! We all make mistakes. Why don't you tell us about it and get it off your chest? I've got nothing to tell, I didn't take it. Let me take him over. I'll get it out of him. You relax, we'll handle this. Who'd you work with on the job? A woman? I didn't work with anyone. - 'Solo, huh?' - I didn't do it. Can't you see, I'm telling the truth. - They all do. - Look, Donovan. You passed the dough to somebody, now, who? Gus, you resigned from the city force. Now, do you mind? What have you done with my wife? When you opened up, you got your cash for the day. Checked everything carefully and then got ready for work. - Right? - Yeah. He gamble? What do you mean by gamble? You know, bet on things with money. Well, he plays poker with the boys, once a week. 'Oh, for what stakes?' I don't know. Five cent limit or something like that. What about the ponies? We go out to the track a couple of times a year. Don't you? Well, yes but I think.. We'll ask the questions, if you don't mind. He got a bookie? I thought it was illegal. I'm sorry you won't be sensible about this. I'd hope we wouldn't have to do it the hard way. I'd be sensible if I confessed to something I didn't do? No. Not if you didn't do it. Well, I didn't. I swear I didn't. If you're innocent as you say do you have any objections, if we search your house? Yes, I do. I don't want a bunch of cops tearing the place apart. I can get out a search warrant. Alright, go ahead. I'm not hiding anything. No. Well, of course not. He's not hiding anything. Not in the house. Some little cutie's got the dough stashed away someplace. - You're a liar! - Ah, you punk! - That's enough. - Are you calling me a liar? I said that's enough! How about the stock market? He play that? No. (male #1) 'What about another woman, Mrs. Donovan?' Oh, don't get mad. Happens to a lot of fellows. What have you done with my wife? She's alright. I'll send her out with the boys when they make the search. And take it easy. If you're innocent, you've got no worries. Yeah. Well, I am innocent. I've got plenty of worries. [instrumental music] What's the matter, you blind or somethin'? - What? - Well, don't you like it? Oh, yeah, fine, fine. Maybe the weather report's more interesting than me, hmm? - I just don't like it. - Then, why read it? Almost a $50,000 theft and not a line in the papers about it. I just don't like it at all. What're you trying to do, doll? Start a scrap book? You don't understand. They're keeping the story under wraps. Now, I won't know what to do about it. Oh, honey. Don't worry about that. We're doin' alright, aren't we? - Yes, but... - Oh, now, look. You stop your worrying. I think it's just wonderful.. In fact I think you're the cleverest man in the whole world. Now, you just forget all about that silly old paper and pay attention. Hmm, you've got company, honey. [instrumental music] [dog whining] Thanks, Jim. That's all. Well? - Not a sign of it. - You make a thorough search? You'd know if your heard what Mrs. Donovan called us. I didn't expect to find much. Well, it's obvious that he was working with somebody else. So, he's had plenty of time to stash the dough in a safe place. Maybe. Come on in, Donovan. Alright, junior. Let's stop playing games, huh? Where's the dough? Oh, came up empty, eh? Alright, you figure out the next move. Would you be willing to submit to the lie detector? Why not? I've got nothing to hide. That thing won't work and you know it. It's worked before and it might help out here. - You ready? - Yeah. Alright. (male #2) 'Mr. Donovan, I'm going to ask you a few question.' Please answer, yes or no as much as possible. Your name, Michael Donovan? Yes. - Are you 35 years of age? - Yes. - Are you married? - Yes. - Do you have any children? - No. 'You're a bank teller by profession?' (Donovan) 'Yes.' 'Did you go straight to work when you left your home.' 'Friday morning?' 'Yes.' - Did you stop off any place? - No. The examiners began to check your cash about 10 o'clock? Yes, by 9:45. And your cash balance journal is checked by the examiners? Yes. Both times. - Both times? - Yes. Do they... usually check your cash twice? No, come to think of it, they don't. 'You're sure?' Yeah, I'm sure. 'The examiner who checked your cash the second time.' 'What did he look like?' Well, he was... stocky, sort of bald. - 'Deep voice?' - No. I'd like to recheck your big money. I'd like to recheck your big money. I'd like to recheck your big money. High pitched, sort of nasal. He had a moustache. Would you recognize his voice if you heard it again? Never forget it. What did he say? "We'd like to recheck your big money." Is he your accomplice? No. 'Pulled the job all alone, eh?' I didn't pull any job. 'Where's the money now?' If I knew that, you'd think I'd be sitting here. Alright. [telephone ringing] - Yes. - 'Mr. Starling? - Yes. - Neil Sanford. Yes, Neil. Did you find out anything? Donovan says the examiners checked his cash twice. Is that the usual procedure? Definitely not. The examiners spot check the cash of every teller immediately upon arriving at the bank and that's that. I've never known them to check a teller twice. Unless, of course, there's an irregularity. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Starling. We'll be talking to you, bye. Alright, you can get him outta that. - Well, what happened? - Nothing. Not one offbeat curve. I told you that machine was no good. I've got a hunch he's telling the truth. You know something, I think so too. Well, I don't. He's rehearsed that story till he knows it as well as Booth knew "Hamlet." Telling it again isn't gonna raise his blood pressure. What he needs is a taste of rubber hose. Stop it. That routine went out with the horse and buggy. Yeah, well, let me tell you something, mister. That guy left with 49,900 bucks and if it's not recovered soon, my company pays the tab. I'm gonna see that that doesn't gonna happen. I'll use any way I can to break this guy down. Send in Ms. Hoard, please. He said they checked his cash twice. Starling says they never check the cash twice. Oh, if that's the case.. - Oh, come in, Ms. Hoard. - Well, thank you. Sit down. You work in the next cage to Mike Donavan? Yes, I do. You notice anything unusual about him the day the money was missing? I noticed he was kind of nervous. Seemed scared about something. All day? No, it was... about 3 o'clock. Right after the bank closed, I first noticed it. Well, then what happened? Well, then.. He kept rechecking his money. And I asked him if anything was wrong but he said he was alright. And then, he went back and got another adding machine and checked it all over again. Tell me, did you, uh.. Did you see anything of this second bank examiner? He keeps talking about it. Uh, stocky man, balding hair with a moustache. No, but I was busy. There could have been such a man. Well, thank you, Ms. Hoard, that's all. Yes, sir. Send in the bank guard, please. There's one thing I would like to say. Yeah? I know Mike. And I'm sure he didn't take that money. Thanks, he'll be glad to hear you say that. Yes, sir. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hello, captain. - Lieutenant. Uh, yes, sir, lieutenant. What can I do for you, sir? The day the examiners were there, did you notice a stocky man with a moustache, thinning hair? Hmm, no. I can't say that I did. But then you see, I see so many people during the day, that is hard to remember all of them. But, uh, no. I don't think so. Sure? Well, at least I don't remember. Well, thanks. That's all. Yeah. Thank you, sir. Nice to have seen you. Wait a minute. I did see a fellow like that. You did? Ye-yes, he was banging on the door. He wanted to get in. Did you let him in? Oh, no, sir, it was after 3 o'clock and the bank was closed. Oh, well, thanks a lot. - That's all. - Thank you, sir. Uh, anything else I can do? No, no, if there is, we'll call you. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. The bank was closed. Come on, let's get Donovan over to the galleries. We'll... check the mug files. See if he can identify this guy. You hope. Looks like him, it looks a lot like him? No, he couldn't possibly be the guy. Serving a ten year stretch in San Quentin. The bank examiners are upstairs, lieutenant. Well, thanks, Phil. Come on. [instrumental music] Can you identify the man who checked your cash? This man checked it first. - That right? - I checked it, yes, sir. - No shortage? - No, sir. Thank you. Can you point out the second man? Well... he had a moustache and not too much hair. Would you mind taking off your hat? No, he looks like him but he's not the man. - You sure? - Positive. Any of you remember recall such a man? - No, sir. - Well, thank you, gentlemen. That's all. Donovan, wait outside. Yeah. Alright, I don't see how we can hold him any longer. Are you guys crazy? He walks in here with some cock and bull story about a second bank examiner and you wanna let him go with a pat on the back and an apology. - What do you think? - It's like I said. I think he's telling the truth. I appreciate your position, Slavin. But don't forget one thing, letting him out of here for now doesn't mean he's scot-free. - You could be right. - I know I'm right. If you are, he'll make a mistake sooner or later. Meanwhile, we'll start a check on all known bank robbers and swindlers. Also, known bank employees who've been discharged during the past year. We'll be in touch with you, Neil. (Neil) 'Right.' And keep your shirt on. Getting hot isn't gonna help a bit. So long. [intense music] - Well. - Oh, what? That's that. You look tired, Mike. Let's go home. There wasn't a single line in any of the papers. So I guess we're lucky in that. Yeah. Let's go home. [instrumental music] [music continues] Good morning, Mr. Donovan. Oh, uh, Mr. Starling would like to see you, sir. Oh? Thanks. - You wanna see me? - Yes, Mike. I, uh, hate to have to tell you this but I'm afraid I'll have to let you go. But why? I'm innocent. Even Sanford said so. And I say so. But unfortunately, Mr. Slavin doesn't share my opinion. His company cancelled your bond. Well, then I'll get bonded someplace else. I'm afraid it's not quite that easy, Mike. You see when one surety company cancels, no other company will issue a policy guaranteeing your honesty. - Well, it's not fair. - I know it isn't. But my hands are tied. Tellers must be bonded. That's part of the bank regulations. I'm terribly sorry. If it were up to me, I'd put you right back in that cage where you belong. Slavin wants to put me in another cage where I don't belong. Believe me, if there's anything in the world I can do... Thanks. Thanks a lot. Bye. (Ruthie) 'Is that you, Mike?' Yes. What are you doing home so early? I got fired. What? Oh, that's not fair. That's what I told him. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. - What are we going to do? - I don't know. I'll get another job, that's all. We'll get... something. Come here. Look. It's great, isn't it? First they put you in jail and then they say you're innocent and then they fire you and then they put a tail on you. Mike. What? It's okay, we-we'll see it through. You'll get a new job and everything will be alright. Sure, everything is gonna be just dandy. Ruthie, you believe me, don't you? - I love you. - But do you believe me? I'll always believe you. Then everything is gonna be alright. Doesn't pay too much money to start but there's a real chance for a go-getter to advance fast. We have a chain of 12 stations and we can always use a good manager. Sounds wonderful. When can I start, Mr. Gregory? Right away. Tomorrow morning, if you can make it. You bet I can. I'll be here. - Good, I'll see you then. - Thank you. Thank you very much. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Alright. (Ruthie) 'Hi.' Hi. What's come over you? I did it. - You did what? - Got a job. Oh, Mike, no. That's wonderful. Where? Uh, it isn't much really but at least it breaks the ice. I got a job at Finley Super Service Station. "Not much," he says. Oh, Mike, I'm so proud of you. Are you really, Ruthie? Oh, you know I am. You know this calls for a celebration. Celebration? Hey. I haven't even gotten paid yet. Never you mind. You sit right there. I'll be right back. - Here you are. - Hey. What have we got here? Oh. You know something? [cork pops] Ah! You are wonderful. Thank you very much. To us. To us. [intense music] Mike. What's the matter? Listen, Slavin, I got a job and I intend to keep it. - You gonna lay off me or... - Get your hands off me. - Mike, please. - Are you gonna lay off me? Don't be a chump. You hit me and I'll have you locked up in 20 minutes for assault, then where would your job be? Come on, Mike. Go ahead with her. She's using here head. Mike. Yes, sir. What can I do for you? Well, you can't do anything for me but maybe I can do you a favor. Oh? What? Special investigator. What's the trouble? That man out there. What about him? Well, you're sure no piker. You pick the big ones. Look here, what do you mean? I mean he's a thief and no penny ante chiseler either. That man heisted almost 50 grand from the Hollywood branch of the Capital Bank. What? 'Course, it's none of my business. I just thought you'd like to know. Oh, yes, yes. You were right. Thank you. Th-thank you very much. Oh, it's nothing. I'll be seein' you. [intense music] [music continues] [tire screeching] I guess you wanna see me. Well, I, uh, I'm sorry. Forget it. Thanks. I called you in because I got a report from the FBI. Yeah? What'd they say? They checked all ex-bank employees on record. And? All of them were from 50-5000 miles away at the time of the theft. Oh. Fine. - All in but three that is. - Oh. And two of them have air-tight alibis. - What about the other one? - He's waiting in the next room. Be careful. Nobody knows better than you what a bad beef can do for a guy. Yeah, I know. Come in, Mr. Johnson. Repeat after me. I'd like to re-check your big money. "I, uh, I-I'd like to re-check your big money." Could you say that again please? "I'd-I'd like to re-check your-your big money." No. He's not the man. Thank, Mr. Johnson, sorry to have inconvenienced you. Oh, that's alright, quite alright. I hope you find your man. - Thanks. - Uh, goodbye. Cheer up. We'll keep after it. How are things going otherwise? Slavin's hounded me out of four straight jobs. Lost the last one just yesterday. Took him a week to catch up with that one. So I've heard. I'll have a talk with him. Tell him to lay off. Might as well save your breath. Is that all? Yeah. That's all for now. Oh, uh, thanks for tryin'. You wanna see me? Yeah. What's on your mind? Why don't you lay off Donovan? Why? Has he been crying? He told me, you've been busy getting him fired. That's right, he get's the works until I get my hands on that 50 grand. Or what's left of it. You're not playing fair, Gus. Look, you and I are cops and we've got a job. I'll admit, sometimes I don't like some of the things I have to do. It's just one big difference. I'm sure he's innocent. No. I'll admit, he's putting on a pretty good act. But as soon as he runs out of dough he'll lead me right to that 50 G's. - You know what I think? - What? You're gonna have a long wait. Maybe, but I still got six months to pay off. I'll tell what I'll do, I bet your new hat that by that time I have both, Donovan's confession and the money. You've got yourself a bet. [dramatic music] Discouraged, Mike? Little. Aren't you? No. We're just starting over, that's all. Yeah. That's all. Well, I'm not worried. You know it... does look a little bit like our first apartment, huh? - Little. - Mm-hm. Now out with you. I've gotta straighten up the place and you'll only be in the way. Oh, would I? Out with you. You would. Okay. I love you. Bye, Mike. [sobbing] [indistinct chatter] (Pete) 'Try not to deadhead back.' Cruise around, try and pick up another fare. Right. - How are you? - Alright. So? You've got a driver named Mike Donovan. So I've got a driver named Donovan, that's a crime? That's a criminal. Tell me more. I'll tell you plenty more if you're interested. Yeah. I'm interested. Go ahead. Your boy, Donovan lifted almost $50,000 off the Capital Bank. That's very interesting. One thing interests me more though. Yeah? What? If the guy lifted almost 50 grand like you say why ain't he in stir? As soon as we find out where he stashed it, he will be. For a long time. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. When he's tossed in the poky, I'll get myself a new driver. Till they pick 'em up, he can work for me just as long as he keeps his nose clean. - Listen, mister... - Now look. I don't care very much for snoopers. Do me a favor and get outta here. Maybe you're gonna be awfully sorry, mister. Maybe. I'm busy. Beat it. [instrumental music] Be right with you. - Six three three one south... - I don't wanna go home. I've been cooped up in that crummy apartment for months. - Vera, please. - Oh, please, nothing. We got a lotta money, why can't we spend some of it? Money, money, money. Can't you think of anything but money? [phone rings] Excuse me. You know I'm getting a little fed up with you. - Be still. - Don't tell me to be sti... Look! Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. - Hello, Donovan, 24. - 'Hello, Mike.' (Pete) 'Listen..' Money. Money. Money. I'd like to re-check your big money. I'd like to re-check your big money. (Pete) 'Mike? Hello. Hello. Mike?' [intense music] Forget it. Probably wasn't the thief at all. - No. - Besides. We're getting along alright now. I even opened a bank account yesterday. Yeah, we get along alright. - Still.. - Michael. - What? - Forget it. Forget what? That's better. Oh, yes. And now, Mr. Michael Donovan.. Your paycheck, if you please. Oh. Mm. Nice. Muscle. - How are you today? - Just fine, thank you. Hello, Gus. What's on your mind? - Trouble? - Maybe. Nothing wrong, I hope. I'd like to check an account of yours. Oh. Who? A Michael and Ruth Donovan. They have anything with you? Mm, just a minute, I'll see. Say, wait a minute. See if they have a safe deposit box, will you? Alright. - Thank you. - Here you are. Here you are. No checking account. Just a small savings account. Eighty nine dollars and fifty cents. - That's all? - That's all. And they don't have a safe deposit box. Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot. - See ya. - Your welcome. Goodbye, Gus. - Here you are, honey. - Uh-uh. It isn't pheasant but it's good for you. You're good for me. I got a surprise for you. What? - It'll cost you. - How much? That much. See, where was I? You have a surprise. Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, Pete Tanner. He wants me to handle the company's books. Mike, that's wonderful. [knock on door] Well.. I don't know, Ruthie, maybe I'm better off the way I am. Oh, you've got to take it. (Gus) 'Hello, Mrs. Donovan.' Come in. What do you want? Just a little conversation. Let's make it as little as possible, uh? I got work to do. Sit down. Thanks. - Well? - I'll make it short and sweet. That'd be nice. In a couple of weeks the six months will be up. That means that my company stands to pay off $50,000. That's your problem. (Gus) 'I didn't expect you to bleed.' 'I thought maybe you might be interested' 'in a little proposition.' Might be. 'Look, Donovan..' I know when I'm licked. As far I'm concerned, you're as free as the breeze and you can stay that way with a little bonus. 'If you play ball.' Well, as far as you're concerned, huh? That's right. Go on. Mike! It's alright. I'll tell you what I'll do, this is my final offer. You turn over the dough and you can keep 10,000 for yourself. What do you say, honey? What do you mean, what do I say? Are you crazy? Hey, Branson. No deal. We're gonna keep all of it. I'm warning you, you better change your mind. Not a chance. Now if you don't mind.. - I oughta.. - I wouldn't if I were you. This is my house, you hit me and I'll have you locked up in 20 minutes. And where would your job be? I'll get you yet, mister, don't you forget it. I'm gonna make you wish you never heard of me. I feel that way, right now. Beat it. [laughing] He's got a nasty temper. Mike... you didn't. Huh? Oh, of course, not, darling. But he's been needling me for six months, it's my turn now. Besides, where would a married man be without a sense of humor? Nowhere, I guess. You know I got an idea when Slavin was talking. Mike, you said you wouldn't. Yeah, I know, but listen to me just this once more then I quit, I promise, Ruthie. - Well, make it fast. - Yeah. We've been looking at pictures of all the known criminals rogues gallery, maybe that's the wrong approach. And what's the right approach? Maybe this guy doesn't have a record. Maybe he's a local fellow. Once worked in a bank or still does. Go on. And if he was his photograph would be on file with one of the bonding companies. Huh? I'm gonna look into that. Okay. It's worth a chance. But don't be excited, you'll just be disappointed again. And come on, I've got some errands to do. - You can give me a lift. - Alright. Ruthie, I've got a plan and you gotta help me. Now listen, this is what we're gonna do. [sighs] - Alright? - Mm-hm. See you in a minute. [screeching] Oh, uh, you'd better get the groceries and I have to pick up few things at the cleaners. Okay. Don't forget the coffee drip grind. I won't forget. Thank you. Forgot the coffee. Forgot the coffee. Oh. [tram bell rings] Almost $50,000 is gone. You say you didn't take it, yet it's gone. And we're responsible for the loss. Then you come in here and wanna look through our files. - Get outta here. - Look, Mr. Temple. I wanna see that money recovered just as much as you do. What are you trying to do, make a chump out of me? - Get this guy outta here. - What's he want? He insists on looking through our files. What for? To identify the bank robber. - So let him. - What? It's okay, let him. Alright. Top drawer, second file. Look under the D's, you'll find him. What's the matter, didn't you hear me? I said, look under the D's. One more crack and we tangle. Oh, so you got feelings. What happened to the iron man? Why don't you give it up? There's still time. Tell me where the dough is. 'Okay, it's your funeral.' 'Like I said, look under D for Donovan.' [sighs] Well.. That does it for this week. - Except for one thing. - What is that? A bank book. Needs a little deposit. I'd better hurry, it's almost closing, I'll be right back. - Here you are, thank you. - Thank you. - All set? - Uh-huh. - Car keys. - Oh, my bag. Uh, I'll get it. These women. [intense music] Mike, what in the world? Teller on the first cage, the one where you left your bag he's the guy I've been looking for. Oh, Mike, you promised. I tell you, he's the guy. You're not letting your imagination run wild. We'll soon find out and I'll stay here watch him you get to a phone, call Sanford tell him to meet me right here. Alright, but please don't do anything till he gets here. Don't worry. Now get goin'. [intense music] [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] What do you want? Why are you following me? That's it. That's the voice. You're the guy. I don't know what you're talking about. Let me hear you say I wanna recheck your big money. Go on, say it. Why should I? I don't know you. I don't know what you mean. No? Say it anyway. We wanna recheck your big money. Say it again. We'd like to recheck your big money. - I could kill you. - No, wait, please! We can talk this over. Alright, talk. I... if I, if I was the man you're looking for.. Which I'm not admitting, you understand. There'd still be no evidence. You... you can't prove anything without evidence. No, wait, please! We could talk business if you're.. If you're only reasonable. Alright, talk reasonable. We split 50-50 if you keep your mouth shut. Nobody will ever know you got it. Does it sound good? Let's see it. I'll send it to ya. I'll get it for ya. I want it now, understand? Now! Alright, alright, but it-it's way across town. 63-31 South what? Chestnut. Let's go. [instrumental music] Hi, M.. 63-31 South Chestnut. [tires screeching] Get Pete. [bell buzzing] You, idiot. You, stupid idiot. What'd you bring him here for? I had to. He threatened to kill me. - It's too bad he didn't. - Vera! How much do you want, mister? Twenty five thousand dollars. Who was the fella that just went in? - Which one? - The older one. What are you, the census taker? The name and apartment number? Name's Tate, got a girlfriend in 308. Thanks. You're not gonna give this guy a cent. What kind of a man are you letting a sap like this chisel in on us? Shut up. Here it is, but on one condition... if you see me again no matter what the circumstances you don't know me. We won't meet again... not if I can help it. You can't, mister. Hand it over. Vera, please! Don't make trouble. Give him his share. You make me sick. Go get the rest of the money. We're getting out of here. You know, it'd be awful hot with you alive. I'd kinda hate to do it too. You're sorta cute. Open up! [banging on door] - Pete? - Who was that? Vera, don't shoot. It's the police. - Open up! - Give me that.. Give me the money. Give it to me! - What's going on here? - Police. Do you have a passkey to this apartment? Oh, no, let me.. - We gotta get outta here. - Are you crazy? I'm not gonna leave all that money. Vera, please, we got our share. Get out! [instrumental music] Try the other one. This is my apartment. Let me in! I'm... Out! Out! Everybody, out! Well.. I told you it was only a matter of time, didn't I, boy? I knew you'd come out with it sooner or later. Look, the guy you want must have gone out that window with a girl. We gotta get him. Oh, sure, the girl. There's always a girl. What'd she do? Run out on you? Who was the guy? Your partner? He was a teller, name of Tate. - I caught up with him... - And I caught up with you. - Look.. - Just relax. Don't worry about the girl, we'll pick her up later. [tires screech] - Listen, sweetheart.. - Just remember this. I go nowhere with you without that dough. But, Vera.. You know, with a few bucks I can stand ya. Without it, you're just a broken down, middle-aged bank clerk. See, there isn't a squad car in sight. But the way he acted, like he was expecting someone. He's not gonna get away with that money. Where's the rest of this? Somewhere in the bathroom. I was hoping you'd try something like that! You dirty rotten piece of.. Let me in.. Let me in there, I say. What's the rhubarb? This goon been bothering you again? What's it all about, kid? Pete. Pete, I found the money. I got to get to Sanford quick. Okay, flow, use the cab downstairs. We'll take care of this friend of yours. What you're doing is a criminal offence, Tanner. - Shut up! - Donovan isn't leaving here! Shut up. I told you to shut up. He's not to get out of this room! Look, I'm not gonna tell you again. Look! What did I tell you? - What are you gonna do? - Get that money. But how he'll go straight to the police with it we can't follow him there. I'm not gonna follow him. He's gonna follow me. Look, he grabbed the bait. Now, all we gotta do is keep him movin' away from the cops. [grunts] Just like an accordion. Keep forgetting my own strength. Let's get out of here. Poor guy wants to take a nap. I can't understand it. He promised he wouldn't do anything till you got there. Oh, I wouldn't worry too much. You go home and try to relax. I'll wait around here in case he calls in. Alright. I guess there's really not much.. [phone ringing] Sanford speaking. - What? - I caught him red-handed. He's mixed up with some dame. His boss Pete Tanner and some hack driver kept me here while he got away with the dough. Yeah, I tell you I want 'em all picked up. I'll be in touch with you, smart guy. Yeah. Goodbye. What happened? Mike just skipped with the fifty thousand dollars. I don't believe it. Where are we going? A friend of mine has a beach cottage. Nice, quiet place where we make a deal with a Donovan. Friend? What friend? None of your business. The cab number is 388. The license number is BEX-99834. Send out a pick up. Cab number 388. I was sure Mike was on the level. I thought he was going to the cops. He is. He'll come back. You'll see. He'll explain everything. I hope so, Mrs. Donovan. He gone after that other man, the teller. Mr. Tate. But he didn't go to Tate's. He went to the girls apartment. All I can learn about Tate is, he's a respectable citizen. Good worker. Worked at the same bank for 15 years. Sure Donovan's in it up to here. Oh, I don't believe you. Not Mike. All we can do is wait. Maybe he'll try and contact us. You need us anymore? No, you can go. Okay, Charlie, come on. We got work to do. Besides, I don't like the company. Come on, lover boy. Just a little further. We gotta be careful, Vera. We gotta be careful. Oh, why don't you shut up. [instrumental music] [music continues] Well, do you see him? - No. - He saw us turn, I know he did. [phone ringing] Hello? Donovan? Trace this call, I'll hold him on the phone. Donovan, you get in here and give yourself up. Are you kiddin'? Listen, Tate and the girl just turned on East Zuma road. That's north of Malibu. You come on in here and start playing detective. I'm not coming in, and I'm not playing. You get out here as quick as you can. Listen, Donovan, I'm telling you to.. Get me the Malibu sheriff's office. [intense music] Vera, we've lost him. Let's turn back. Forget about the rest of the money and get out of town. I don't even think I can stand you with the money. [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] Get your hands up. Get up to the door. [intense music] Alright. Get over there. I'll take the money, Mr. Donovan. Nice of you to have brought it all with you. You won't get very far with it. A lot further than you're gonna get, mister. What do you mean? What do you think I mean? He's the only one who can identify us. Go ahead. Let him have it. You don't want to kill me, Tate. The most you can get now is a prison term for theft if you kill me, it means the gas chamber. - Kill him. - Don't listen to her, Tate. She'll throw you to the wolves, you know she will. Shut up, you.. Let him have it now! - I can't! I can't! - Of course you can't. You're no killer, Tate. - Shoot him! Shoot him! - I won't! I've done everything else for you, but I'm no murderer. Vera! [gunshot] [Vera grunts] You in the house come out with your hands up before we start shooting. [instrumental music] (male narrator) Well, it's over. Everything ends sooner or later. Even the bad things. Everything is rosy now Michael Donovan sitting on top of the world.. Or is he. (Neil) 'I'd like to recheck your big money.' Neil! You, uh, think it's a little too racy for me? Well, it's got a lot of you in it. Yeah, about six feet. Oh, no.. Don't tell me he's still trying. [both laughing]
