What is next for you guys, buying an island? - No way, we're headed right back to the studio and we're not leaving until this next album is done. - What about if the line was more like ♪ Girl don't tell your parents 'bout the two of us ♪ That rhymes better with ♪ Hands on you in the back of the school bus ♪ - It's gotta be don't tell your parents about me. She can say whatever she wants about herself. - Well it's about the two of us, we can write the number two in the song. - It's only cool if you're replacing t-o-o, it doesn't matter if you're replacing the same fucking number. - Can we just take it from the bridge, Davy. - My last kiss with Debbie was on a bridge. - We know, you say that every time someone mentions the word bridge. That happens a lot, we're making an album. So just push the button, it makes the music play. - Yep bridge, coming up. ♪ I'm waiting for you girl to text me or call ♪ ♪ We can sneak off and chill at the back of the mall ♪ - Ugh, see it steps on the whole concept of sexy texting in algebra class. It just, it sounds derivative. - It wouldn't be derivative if we mic the synth with the Neuman 87, like I been saying the whole time. - The Neuman is a vocal mic. - In this song the synth is the vocal. - Oh, it's just the new guy. - Yeah, it's just me. Is Johnny here yet? - No new guy, Johnny's not here. If he was here do you think Henry would still be rereading this four month old copy of Real Simple for the 1,000th time, you idiot. - Oh is that the issue that tells you how to organize candles? - Yeah, it is that issue. It tells you how to organize candles in every issue. We've been waiting on you two hours Johnny. ♪ 9-1-1 means I need you now, girl ♪ - Sorry, shul ran late. - If it happens every time it's not running late. It's just the way the stupid thing runs. - He's here now Lance. Can you stop with that stuff and start making some music? And I hate to keep being the bad boy, but I'ma need you to get in these cans and get on the mic. - Sounds like a plan. - No, we need you to get into the mastering room and go over the notes from yesterday's session. - That also sounds like a plan. - Hey Davy, can you start with the first verse of Encore? - New Guy, can you just hand back for a second, let the original members of the band handle this? Davy, can you go to the second verse of Encore and then go back to the verse right before that one? ♪ I think you thought the show was done ♪ ♪ Grab your jackets you had fun ♪ ♪ But we got a surprise in store ♪ ♪ Before you head to the door ♪ ♪ Do you wonder why the lights stayed off ♪ ♪ Or why none of your friends took off ♪ ♪ Sitting here thinking ♪ - It's missing something. - There's an opportunity for some unique polyrhythms on that sixth and seventh beat. - You know there's a unique opportunity for you to shut the fuck up, and it's now. Johnny, what do you think? Johnny? What the hell Johnny? - Hey I was looking at that! - Since the untimely death of Dr. Johnny M. Throbstein his state of the art facility has been... - Can you go a day without googling yourself? - No Henry, and I won't have to. Because this album, this is the one. I know the 16 years since our debut album we've seen a decline in our popularity, but this album put me right back up where I belong. - We belong. - Where we belong, on top of Google Mountain. Up above Dr. Johnny M. Geriatric, gastro-astronomogist. - And Johnny Throbstein And Sons funeral homes. - What, Throbstein And Sons is above me? - We're gonna get you back to that spot Johnny, we're so close. - But to make that happen, you got to focus up here. Just a few more weeks, drop one last song. But first, you got to put your phone away and tell us your notes from yesterday. - Uh guys, this guy says he's your accountant and it's urgent. - Okay, put him on speaker. - Hello? - Hey Mort, yeah could this wait? We're getting a lot of great progress done today and... - Sure you are, I'll be quick. I've got good news and bad news. Start with the good news. According to the latest issue of Forbes out this week, Heartthrob Boyz is worth 19 mil. - Great, what's the bad news? - You owe the IRS 20 mil. - I'm sorry, are you saying we don't have much money? - You have so little money, my wife wouldn't fuck you. Let me put it this way. Do you have any white babies to sell? You got to finish this album so you can get your bonus from the label. - No problem Mort, we're really cruising along here. Just one more song before we finish. - You've been really cruising for 15 years, time's up guys. - How many more weeks of studio time do we have budget for? - Today's the last day. - Davy, Davy, you're a music guy right? You haven't had to listen to some mathy, math nerd right? You're not gonna kick us out right? You can have until 4:00 a.m., but after that the studio's booked. - 12 hours! - Dude chill out, you can't rush greatness. This album will be birthed when... - Hey, I am broke and I am lonely. If I have to tell my mother I'm moving in with her because the album I spend the last 15 years on is not happening, I wanna kill, I wanna kill someone. Probably three someones. So let's get in there and finish. Who's with me, huh? - Hey Davy, tell me when you're rolling. - You want this to go through the LA2A or the Yeurig 1176? - Uh, the first one I guess. - I been tinkering with Two Hearts. I think I've made it a little bit more radio friendly. - We've already got Two Hearts in the bag man, can we please just focus on Encore. ♪ Two hearts beating, two hearts fleeting ♪ ♪ Two hearts eating at my love ♪ ♪ Two hearts conniving, two hearts surviving ♪ ♪ Two hearts driving in my car ♪ And cut there. You guys like it. - It's kind of repetitive no? - Don't listen to New Guy, it was so much better than that sloppy opus Henry pushed on last week. - Hey. - I was listening to the radio on the drive over, I think that's what's selling now. What do you say Henry puts down a rap over this. - Uh, maybe this song doesn't need a rap. - Every song needs a rap. - Or you know, we could bring on a guest vocalist, that's pretty big now too. - Why would you order Panda Express, when you've got P.F. Chang's sitting in your kitchen? I want you to get in there and put this jam over the top with one of your sick flows that you know how to do my neighbor. - My neighbor? - Yeah, you my neighbor. ♪ Two hearts conniving, two hearts surviving ♪ ♪ Two hearts driving in my car ♪ ♪ Girl I noticed your seatbelt isn't that stud ♪ ♪ Maybe give it a tug to make sure it's snug ♪ ♪ If there's an accident, it'll keep you safe ♪ ♪ The belt should be on low, tight around your waist ♪ ♪ It needs to be worn correctly to protect your brain ♪ ♪ Girl don't put your arm over the shoulder strap ♪ ♪ Are you insane ♪ - That's It! - Dude that was awesome. - Killer homie. - Now it's starting to sound like a hit. Davy, hit us with the playback. - I don't know why, but my monitor signal is weak. As weak as the fight I put up in my battle for custody. - Dude, did you get the take or not? - Yes, yeah I sure did. But you know what, there is a plate reverb backfiring and I've got some spare triple E1394s that I'm gonna have to reroute. - So for Encore, I really feel like we need to get rid of that bridge. It's kind of ruining the song and it's very boring. - No, my bridge is the only part that's musically revolutionary at all. - Is Top 40 radio desperate for a bunch of jushed up jazz chords? 'Cause if they are, I didn't get the memo. - Guys, did you know that... - Band meeting, original members only. - Sorry, I'm just looking for a lil truth in music. - So like Backstreet? - No, I mean a band with a message. - Like New Kids? - No, I'm saying we need to dig deep and explore our evolving genre's serious musical roots, like the Monkees. - You pretentious piece of shit. - We could be like that, we could be something more. - All right look, the only way to make sure a song works, is if it makes them panties drop, right? So why don't I call Tina. - No! - Leave Tina out of this. We can solve this within the band. - Um, track one. ♪ I'm going out today ♪ ♪ Fuck party USA ♪ ♪ I'm gonna have some fun ♪ ♪ And before I'm gone, I'm gonna fuck someone ♪ ♪ Should I go bro, what'd do you say ♪ ♪ Is it a fuck party all the way ♪ ♪ Will there be poon and tits and lots of dicks ♪ ♪ And can you promise me everyone there ♪ ♪ Will find something to fuck ♪ ♪ I'm going out today ♪ ♪ Fuck party U ♪ - There's a brilliant musician somewhere in you Johnny. Can you please let him write something that matters? - Wait. Are you saying this is a miss? I put this song first because it's a message song. It's about the worst day of my entire life. - The worse day of your life was about going to a fuck party? - Ugh. Oh my. Are you even listening to the lyrics? No, the song is about the journey of life itself. And more specifically, the journey when Tall Jason invited me to a fuck party and I went with him. And when I arrived, it wasn't a fuck party at all. There was no one to fuck, all right. ♪ Now I'm here and there's nobody ♪ ♪ Nobody at the fuck party ♪ ♪ How can you call this a fuck party ♪ ♪ When there's no one at the fuck party ♪ - Raw truth, emotional honesty, and has the power to be a hit. New Guy, hit one of the Henry's rapsies that no ones ever gonna hear. - Which track? - Love Alphabet please. ♪ You, you fit me to a T ♪ ♪ So here's an IOU ♪ ♪ I sometimes wonder why ♪ ♪ Oh why when I see you ♪ - Oh my god did you guys hear that? I think that was raccoons being strangled in the ducts. No, it's your song. - Maybe we should just start all over with the whole album. - No! - Look, right now this album has a little something for everyone. And 15 years is long enough to be working on one album. All we need is a title track, so let's not lose sight of that, okay guys? - You can share your songs to the world, and I can share mine, we can get our bonus millions and get out of this God forsaken studio. - Is this the verse or the chorus? - Both, here I was thinking something more like this, look. - Ugh, good God, no. - There's something I really like about how... - No there isn't. This is the title track guys, that stuff sounds like a single. Johnny, show 'em. - Singles can be complicated and musically interesting. - No, they can't. In fact I want to propose a six chord limit. - And I want to propose a 25 chord minimum. - Maybe less is more. - More is more. - Okay, song off. Most popular complicated songs, Henry go. - MacArthur Park. - Yeah, I want to be the guy responsible for MacArthur Park, when there's three chord masterpieces out there like Rock Around The Clock, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, Walking On Sunshine. - What about Autumn Almanac by the Kinks, right. That's a very intricate structure and I believe in Europe that it charted as... - If you have to tell us how high it went in Europe, it's a shitty song. - All right, truth is you don't even need three chords to make a hit. There's two chord brilliance, like Walk On The Wild Side, or Horse With No Name. - Ugh, if you guys want simple music, okay. And every one of those songs you mentioned has something else going for it. And it's something we've all been too scared to mention to you. Johnny you haven't written two lines of worthwhile lyrics in 15 years. Without that, we're not gonna have another hit, no matter how catchy the music is. - But, but Fuck Party USA. - Henry's right. - Yeah well congratulations. Tell your new lead singer I'm outta here, I quit. - Where you going Johnny, we need you? - I'm getting really tired of the burden of being the bad boy in this band. - Stop calling yourself that! You're like a soft vegan teddy bear, no one thinks of you as the bad boy! - I thought I'd find you here. - 'Cause I've been texting you I'd be here. - No, it's just a feeling I had. So, Henry said the silliest thing today. He was all, "You haven't written worthwhile lyrics "in 15 years and we're never gonna have "another hit song until you do." Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous? I said have you ever heard anything so ridiculous? Tina, have you ever heard anything so ridiculous? Have you ever heard anything so preposterous from another human Tina? Oh great, you're taking his side, of course you are. - Do you remember that time I walked in on you having sex with that guy and that woman and the other guy and the other woman and that horse and that kugel and that Japanese Peace Lilly and that 2004 calender of Ansel Adams photos? - The time with the cinnamon raisin kugel. - No, the potato kugel. - Oh yeah. - And we sat down and we talked and you told me that it was an accident. - It probably was. - I know who I married, I'm not trying to change you, all I really need is honesty. People love honesty. And they turn to musicians to give it to them. - This is the shittiest painting I've ever seen in my life. - Have you ever been arrested? - No. - Punched a fan? - Heaven's no. - Owned a motorcycle? - Absolutely not. - Shot an endangered species, blown coke off a hooker, blowed a load onto a hooker, pissed on a national monument, gone a three day meth binge with a member of Sly & The Family Stone, or even ever been late to anything you've ever done? - No, no, no, no, no, no, and yes. - Really? - Yeah, the day my godson was born, I was late to our show in Cleveland. - That's right, I forgot about that. You unprofessional piece of garbage. Henry, by any sane person's measurement, you're not the bad boy of this group. - Well according to Teen Scream, I am. - Yes I remember this, from 2001, when the racist editors of every teeny bopper magazine thought every black kid was a bad boy. The month before this, their bad boy was Urkel. - To be fair, he did do a lot of damage to the Winslow household. - You don't have to steal stuff to be a bad boy. Or rode around on a motorcycle. You just have to be that one member of the band that stands up to the lead singer while the others act like a bunch of cowards. - Oh congratulations, your honesty has broken up the Heartthrob Boyz. - Have faith in Johnny, he'll come around. - It doesn't make any sense, I'm honest with my songs. When I had my heart broken, because you didn't want me to also start sleeping with your mother, I wrote Two Hearts, about how guys should be allowed to sleep with mothers and daughters. - That's what's that's about? - Obviously, so? - No. - Right, in Fire Of Love, about when I got that... - We. - Fine, when we got that STD. I felt like my penis was really on fire, so I turned it into a song. - You're talking about your surface again Johnny. - No, it burned inside the shaft as well. - I know there's like something deeper in there. - People don't want deeper. - You just have to write a super catchy song that actually speaks to people's souls and you'll be a total legend. - What if there isn't anything deeper? What if I'm all surface? - I know it's in there, maybe this will help get it out. - A kiss? - No, it's what I put in your hand before the kiss. - Ooh drugs, that's great. What am I looking at here? - More like what aren't you looking at. Just make sure you take the blue ones before the red ones after the small white ones... - Yeah, yeah, I know drugs Tina. - The big white ones then the blue gel. - Yeah. - Okay, one day left. Ha, how about a little word association to get the lyrics flowing? - Great idea, love. - Pickle. - Maybe, maybe. ♪ Gonna give you a tickle with my love pickle ♪ - It's not that sexy. - Johnny you're back, thank God! - What did I miss? - So is the band back together? - I can't do it without you guys.

Fuck. - How dead? - He seems pretty dead. - Shit. - Shit. - Fuck. - Better call a Morgue. - No, I just got a place in Amsterdam, I haven't been to yet, okay. I'm not losing it, we're not giving up. Grab a leg. - You really think this is gonna work? - Of course it's work, it's like a music defibrillator. And if it doesn't work, no harm done, right? Davy, you think you can get enough juice? - You bet, we're gonna reroute through the mixer, double up watts on the half stack, kick on the overdrive and we will be pulling off a full on reverse Keith Relf. - Who? - Member of the Yardbirds, got electrocuted in the basement. - Okay, stand back. - Oh my god. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. All right, so option one did not work. - What so you mean option one. How many ways do you think there are to bring someone back from the dead? - I don't know, eight? - He's dead, we need to call Tina, we need to call his folks, and figure out what we're gonna do with this album. - Guys, I was thinking. - Not now New Guy, we just lost an original member of the band okay. So whatever you have to say, shut it. - What if we take the digital recordings of Johnny's vocals and rework them into new tracks. We have all this raw material that no one's ever heard before and Davy's a genius who can do anything, so why don't we just... - That's it. - See. - No, not what you said, that was stupid. The thought I had when you were saying your dumb idea. We cyborg him. - I'm sorry? - Yeah, New Guy even said it himself. Davy is a genius, he can do anything. All we gotta do is rip away some pieces of flesh and replace it with like robotic metal pieces that will eventually fuse itself into like a nuclear fusion cell running on cyborg power. - Lance, I know you're upset about losing your friend. No one wants Johnny back as much as I do, at least I thought I didn't until you said all that weird shit you just said, but... - I am not losing Johnny. We are not losing Johnny. I'm gonna march back in there and tell Davy we're cyborging him. - No, what you're talking about is morally repugnant and we're holding a Heartthrob hearing. - You wouldn't dare. - It's done. You're for it, I'm against it, and Johnny's not around to decide. We have to hold a hearing and New Guy gets a vote. - New Guy never gets a vote. - He does today. Johnny was our friend, he was wonderful and flawed and he died too young, but bringing him back as a cyborg is stupid and insane and it won't work. - Objection, speculation. - Sustained. - Guys you all agreed with me, that what was missing from Johnny's music was his humanity. How will bringing him back as a half robot solve our problem? Since robots don't have feelings. - Objection, misleading. C-3PO, Marvin, WALL-E, Johnny 5. - Sustained, robots can feel, everyone knows that. - We have to call his parents and tell them he is dead. What we don't need to do is chop him up into little pieces so he'll be reassembled as a monstrous half human Automaton. I guess I rest my case. Oh my god. - Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it's a sad state of affairs in our nation when the force of bigotry and hate override the notions of progress and light. Oh, you'll let them make you coffee, let them vacuum your rug day in, day out, let them make you cars. - Those are normal service robots. - Precisely, and it's fine with you if they exist as long as they stay in their place and serve you. I remember a time in this country when young children who were half black and half white was seen as heinous in polite society. - Lance, if you even try to make this argument. - Henry here, clearly thinks that like the black people of the last century, robots should be treated like second class citizens. That he himself would never fraternize with a robo-mulatto. - Objection. - On what grounds? - On the grounds I'ma break my hand off in his goddamn face. - Sustained. - Fine, I call Davy to the stand. How long have you been working with electronics? - About 48 years. - And this would be your first cyborg making? - No. - How many cyborgs have you made? - Uh six. - What? - Three petbots, two sexbots, one toaster bot, well the toaster bot doubled as a sex bot, but you know I'm gonna say six sex bots. - I mean that's incredible. And how many of these creatures were made from reanimated humans? - Uh none, it's not possible. - But if you did it... - It ain't possible. I want to do it just to show robo racist Henry what's what, but I don't have that kind of power. - Wow, I am more intrigued and way more creeped out by the guy who's been running our sound for the past 15 years. I'm forced to rule in Henry's favor. - Yes. - We will not by cyborging Johnny. - So what are we gonna do with him then? - It's Tina, she's gonna be here in five minutes. - Shit, shit, she can't see this. ♪ Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, one more chance ♪ ♪ To love you ♪ ♪ Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, one more chance ♪ ♪ 'Cause my heart won't tell me no ♪ ♪ Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, one more chance ♪ ♪ To love you ♪ ♪ Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, one more chance ♪ ♪ And I'll give you that last smile ♪ ♪ Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, one more chance ♪ ♪ To love you ♪ ♪ Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, one more chance ♪ ♪ 'Cause my heart won't tell me now ♪ ♪ Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, one more chance ♪ ♪ To love you ♪ - Oh, hi Tina. - Ugh, is Johnny dead? - Uh, yes. - We're very sorry for your loss. - Well don't just stand there, let's bring him back. - Do what? - Musicians are so selfish, you were just gonna let him stay dead? - Well, I mean, we assumed. - Don't you know what they say about assuming Henry, it makes an ass out of you and ming. - Who is Ming? - Some ass my cousin married. - So have you ever actually brought someone back before? - A member of my yoga class knows a guy in Moran whose done it. - Let's just say for a moment, that's not the stupidest thing anyone's ever said before. - Well you guys just Weekend At Bernie's your lead singer to trick his wife to think he's still alive, so I would hold onto that stupidest thing ever comment for a while if I were you, okay? - Good point, so what do we do? - It's research time. - What do you mean, Google things? - Like I said research, how do you do research? You sit in a library with a thumb up your ass, you idiot? - You tell the newbie, boom. - Try typing how do you bring a person back from the dead. - Whoa, 164 million results. JC writes, "Does anyone know "how to bring a person back from the dead?" And, "Yeah, I want to know that too." "Bump, motherfucking dead, LOL, kill yourself." That's not helpful. - What do you want on your pizza? - Is there a menu? - Menu, it's pizza. - I like to know my options. - I'm the menu. I have anchovies, I have pepperoni, I have sausage, I have olives. - Do you have sun-dried tomatoes? - I'll find the menu. - Thank you. - Hey everyone this is Kevin, this is another episode of Supernatural DIY. I been getting a lot of requests on how to bring someone back from the dead. And today's episode, we're gonna show you how to do that. This is a corpse, this is in my garage, but before we get to that, - Oh my god this is so boring. Get to the good stuff. - If you was following me on Twitter last week, I'm really sorry about everything that happened. - Wait go back a little, I think you missed something. - But when you come back outta that, you get to... So now I'm 'bout to bring him back to life, but, but before that, I want to give a shout out to Mail Chimp, they have a promo code of XE5534. - You got a menu? - No, much better, it's a quiz. Are you dating a bad boy? - Hmm, and if you're dating me, then you definitely are dating a bad boy. - Clearly, first question. Does your man put down the toilet seat for you after he pees? Oh, I bet you do, I'm marking that. - No, I pee sitting down, so it's already down after I get up. - That's like 10. - No, but the answer is I do not put it down after I pee, next question. - And as you can see, rigor mortis is really starting to set in right now, but by the way if you go to Squarespace and they build beautiful website, don't forget to like the video, it should be popping up down there somewhere. I'm on all the social media site, Twitter, Instagram, Friendster, you can fleek me there, I'm on Myspace, you can blump. - How often does your man call his mother? Once a day, once a week, once a month, or once a year? - Never, oh phones are so impersonal. I bought her a house right next door to mine after she broke her hip. So now when we catch up, we do it over primrose tea in the evenings. Bad boy for life dude. - Dammit, this is a three minute video, where's the six seconds that tells you how to do the thing? - So is Johnny alive yet or what? - No. - This is ridic, the internet's full of idiots who don't know what they're doing trying to tell us what to do. We might to actually go to a library or something. - No, no, no, look, we've all seen a dozen movies where they brought people back to life, it's always the same thing. Get some dim lights, throw some skulls around, get some incense, say some shit that rhymes, right? Do I have to do everything myself? ♪ Hey, we shall make them witch ♪ ♪ Hey, we shall make a witch ♪ ♪ Hey, we shall make them witch ♪ ♪ Hey, we shall make them witch ♪ - God's of darkness hear our plea, bring Johnny Throbstein back to me. - Zombies are scary, mummies are mean, somebody farted, I think it was me. - Crystal balls and Ouija time. - Call to souls and death refine. - Should he be in here, like holding hands with us or something? - No, he's fine. - Hallow by death, hallow by birth, there's no way in heck this malarkey works. - Hallowed by... - Shut up, we already did the hallowed thing all right. - Fine, okay, how 'bout wandering soul beneath empty skies, twigs turn worn from ancient cries.

I tried to go and write from an honest place, but somehow the 30 pills you gave me didn't help. - What, do you guys like not understand what's going on here? Think of how good Nikki Sixx's stuff got after two minutes of being dead. My Johnny's been dead two hours, so quit playing the blame game and help me get him back. - Johnny, you got more work to do here on earth. - Uh do I, I'm not so sure. - Yeah, we really miss you. - Who said that? - What, seriously! - Hey, he's a selfish prick and always has been. We got to speak his language. Johnny, if you stay dead do you know how you're gonna be remembered? - Uh, as a sex symbol? - Nope. - A pop icon? - Nope. - Fine, the lead singer of the sixth most popular boy band in the 90s? - No Johnny, the answer is you won't be remembered at all. You'll be a one hit wonder that shows up on internet clickbait for the next five years, until eventually everyone forgets you ever existed. - Sorry, he's right. We're giving you the chance to come back and make yourself the legend you were born to be. - Or failing that, at least you're in a second career as a judge on a network singing talent show. But the choice is yours. (everyone laughing_ - Yay, yeah! - No love, is it 'cause I'm the undead? - Just a lil bit. - Get in here, come on. Hey guess what, we've got an album to, okay good enough. We've got an album to finish, let's do it. - Yes. - Oh, good to have you back Johnny Throbstein. - Thanks baby. - Tina, oh, so glad you were here, what a blessing. Now if you could just at-da, we'd get some real work done, okay thanks a lot. - Maybe I can help you guys. - Ugh, I told you she was gonna be a total... - Okay now that's racist. Um, we just don't need you, you know Linda McCarthying up our process right now. - You guys, the afterlife was so choice. Everyone I ever loved and lost was there. And guess what they told me. - Hey, if it's not the chord progression for our next hit, save it for the Rolling Stone interview, all right buddy. You got it. - Yeah. - Hey, and you guys, thanks for never giving up on me. - I did a little bit. - Hey, I just realized something. This is my encore. It's an encore of life. That's what the song Encore should be about. Not about teaching kids about concert encores. ♪ We need an encore 'cause we can't give up ♪ ♪ We need an encore 'cause we won't give up ♪ - Well you can't write won't give up with itself, but it's a great start, we're back on track. - Oh my god, Goldie's dead. - We're not gonna do another seance, just flush him. - He was alive this morning. - We'll dedicate a track to him and the 46 other goldfish who died in the process of making this album. Now enough about the fish, let's get back to work. - But still. - Now, when I was in the nether reaches of the afterworld, I kept hearing this awesome backing vocal. - Mm-hmm. - I want you guys to try 'em. I think they're catchy as hell. ♪ Uh, uh ♪ - Are these the last ps of the undead made audible? - They might be. Hey Davy, how 'bout laying down a sweet drum track on this one? - You mean like live drumming? - What no, like a vintage drum machine. You know like from the late 80s or whatever. - Oh okay, I got one in the garage. I'll go find it. - Okay, we'll work on the backing vocals and when you get back I'll punch in the drums. - Naw, naw, I'll just punch 'em in like I always do. - Yeah, we don't have time for this. New Guy fine, make me the bad boy again. - Bad guy, the phrase is bad guy. - Same diff, you can't play the drum machine. - Uh very funny, more haze the newbie crap. But you're not gonna tell me what I can and can't do. - It's not that we won't let you play drum machine, you don't know how to play the drum machine. - Excuse me, but I played all the drum machine on the first album so. - No you didn't. We recorded over all your drum parts in the mastering session, so you'd feel less like a newbie and more like a member of the band newbie. - Don't take it so bad. A lot of musicians couldn't play their own instruments. Ultimately they end up disgraced on the cover of People magazine, and take their own life. - Yeah. Oh, the pizza's here, thank God. - Can you hold this? Hey Johnny, explain it to him. - You got cash for this right? - Oh no, let me go ask the guys. - No, no, no, it'll be fine. I'll just turn on the old cute one charm, she'll be paying us before it's done. Hey girl. - $47.50. - Hey girl, bad news is I don't have any cash in my pocket. Good news is, you can look for yourself, see if you find anything you like. - Uh Lance, I think on this one, you should just... - Seriously right now, you're ruining my vibe. - Um. - Hey, it would be a good story for you. It's not every day you get to deliver pizza to a celebrity. - Uh listen to your pal buddy, you're whacking at the wrong bush okay? - Do you not recognize me?

I get it, okay, let me get to work. Hey, I bet you put a lot of miles on your car delivering? Tell me, do you get paid the IRS mandated 57 cents per mile or... - I actually drive a company car, so it's not actually my money. And speaking of money, pay me for my goddamn pizza. I don't know if you noticed, but it's pretty messed up out there okay. - Yeah, I got you. - You're my last delivery and I just wanna get home and hide away from the world, so. - Own or rent?, cause I hate to say it, but I think you might have missed your opportunity to buy at the market rate. - Stop it, stop it.

Or else she would have found me irresistible. - I'm lesbian, I'm not blind, you're just not cute. And you, I've seen birds on the shoulders of Disney princesses who are more threatening than you. - I don't have any money, but if I did, it would definitely come out of your tip. - Oh my god, oh my god. - Breaking news, we've got exclusive footage of the adorable squirrel that is taking the internet by storm. - But first, breaking news. A global computer malfunction is causing massive damage worldwide. Including accidental nuclear missile launches, which have started an all out war between India and Pakistan. Airplanes falling from the sky over Europe, self driving cars colliding in England, and here in the US, there are even reports of Cabbage patch Kids rising up against their owners. - Well fortunately the only people that still own Cabbage Patch Kids are weirdo 40 year olds who can't let go of their childhoods, so no big loss there. But wow, that other shit sounds super bad. - Yes, it does. - You know what, let's take a look at that squirrel video again. I think we've got that, just cue that up would you Rick. - I don't know 'bout you guys, but I'm gonna root for India. I mean if I can't have lamb saag, I'm gonna freak. - The more things change. - What, a nuclear war has broken out over 25% of the world population. - I guess the remaining 82% of us are just gonna have to keep on keeping on, right compadres? - I got to text the ashram, see if everybody's okay. - Tina, dudes, pizza woman. - It's Janet, and somebody still owes me $47.50. - Guys, things are out of control, we need to focus on what we can do. Oh my god that's a great lyric. ♪ Some things are outta control ♪ ♪ We need to focus on what we can do ♪ ♪ Like avoiding bad tacos ♪ No, that's terrible. Well, let's get back in the studio and finish this thing. Guys, I didn't come back from the dead so I can watch the news. I can back to play some music. And we've got half a day to finish this thing and well, I'm not gonna give up. New Guy come on, I'm gonna teach you how to play drum machine. - Wow, you really do believe in me, huh Johnny? - Hell yeah I do man. Watch what I do. Now you try it. - It's no use. - New Guy, it's like Johnny Throbstein always says, starting 15 minutes ago, never give up. - Hey can I use my thumb and my index finger? Maybe I'm over thinking it. - Look, you don't program a drum machine with your head. You program a drum machine with your heart. Now close your eyes and try it again. - Yeah, you got it, that's it! Yes! Hey we're making some real progress in here, so unless the US is under attack from Ukraine, butt out. - And the invading Ukrainian Army has now swept across most of southern California, all the way up through Nevada and should be pushing through parts of Colorado over the next several hours, where we can expect them to encounter the hoard of zombies that have been pummeling that whole region creating a deadly mix that will last at least through the weekend. What? - You just sounded like a weatherman just now. - Oh eww, gross. - What's wrong with weathermen, you don't like them? - Are you kidding, weathermen are disgusting. You know standing in a poncho out in the middle of a tornado acting like they're behind enemy lines. No, no, no, no weathermen are grotesque. - Well I don't know if they're necessarily... - And what do they teach you in weatherman school anyway? You know how to be wrong 75% of the time and wear bad sports coats. Sorry Carl, my bad. - Fuck you Chad. - Anyway, martial law has been declared and a nationwide curfew is in effect. So stay indoors or risk immediate execution. - Um, if it's okay with you guys, I'm gonna hang out here a little okay. Pizza's on me. - Cute one powers activate. - I always knew this might happen. - You did? - Yeah, if Ukrainia is attacking, the music is our only shot to bring the world together in peace. Look, what I'm about to tell you, it will be better if I face you all. It would be better if I faced you. This is our time. We can write a song that saves the world. - I'm pretty sure saving the world is a job for rock and roll. - Yeah catchy, sense driven, light dance pop, probably won't do it. - It's a good point, but Ukrainia or not, this is our last day in the studio. Now let's get back in there and get back to work, come on! - Yeah. - Yeah, pump juice. - And now it appears they're destroying the space needle. This is just unbelievable. Can we get footage of that? We... Wrong footage guys. - Still adorable though, that little squirrel, gotta love that little guy. - Maybe I've been thinking about this all wrong.

And shittier. - That's too bad 'cause it kind of gave me an idea for a rhythm. Oh my God! - No! - But there's gotta be something we can do. - Looking like this is gonna take a while. I'm gonna hit the head. - Is clapping really that important to your sound? I thought you guys were all drum machines and vocals. - I thought you'd never heard of us. - Of course I've heard of you, I was in junior high school too you know.

A rock and roll miracle. - Retro, new wave, synth driven like dance pop. - And not just any retro, new wave, synth driven lite dance pop miracle, but a retro, new wave, synth driven line. - Lite dance. - Lite dance pop miracle that might just save this album.

We have an hour left to finish the album. - Which is why I can't put this off any longer okay. I'm not a rapper, I'm just black okay. And I think that you guys are mistaking black for amazing rapper. - That's ridiculous Henry, what about the rapping you did on our two hit singles? - And what about that sick flow you laid down on the PSA we did on paint huffing? - Or those fire rhymes you dropped as the rapping toucan on the mac and cheese commercials. - Yes, see you're incredible. And if you don't believe me, believe pizza woman over here. - Janet. - Pizza Janet said that our song, When I Page 9-1-1 changed her life. - I didn't actually say that. - You can't walk away from that. - It's not, I don't. - Hey look, I may not be able to convince you that you can hip hop down a dope flow, but I know a certain old school rapper from back in the day who can. - That's really not helping. - And that rapper is you.

Oh, oh. - Johnny, fellas, it's the news, they're about to interview a real live alien. - We can now officially report that TBT Local 5 has landed an exclusive interview with the alien representative. - This is the first time anywhere that one of our new alien overlords has spoken on television to the conquered people of earth and he's doing it right here, on TBT Local 5. - First of all we want to welcome you to the leader in local weather, TBT Local 5. So excited to have you here with us, what are you feeling on earth so far? - It's a mix of exhaustion from interplanetary travel and ambivalence about the destruction of your species. - Uh excuse me Mr. Alien, Chad Pixley here, Action 5 News Squad. - Your name and rank are immaterial. There will be no graves to mark your bloody departure from earth. - Uh now, we aren't gonna shy away from the tough questions here at TBT Local 5. So I need to ask you, what is your opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? - Are you not curious about the 10,000 millennia of slavery, which will begin for the 1% of you we allow to survive? - Trying to dodge the tough questions, but there's no where to hide on TBT Local 5. - All right Chad, what was your question? - The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, what is your opinion? - All humans taste equally delicious to us. - Can you clarify your stance on immigration? - We will be submerging all earth and the land masses in water to turn your planet into a breeding ground for our hydrosensitive larvae. So land borders will be a thing of the past. - All right now, let me get you outta here on a fun one. Mr. Alien, boxers or briefs? - Chad you are terrible. - Our genitals are accessed remotely by a six dimensional time squirt, thus leaving us free from the constraints of your solar system's underpants. - So what is it, huh? Drum roll please. - Briefs. Begin the ritual death ceremonies of your loved ones. We expect a completely... - I am so sorry but we are out of time here. - You're all gonna die. - Chad, are you a little worried about the weather this weekend? - Uh, well the bright side is that we humans wanna feel this could front coming in from the north, but let's go to Carl for all the details. Carl, take it away. - Turn it off. The amount of resources local news allocates to weather, is depressing. - This is such a bummer. I'd always secretly hope I'd witness an apocalypse. - Yeah, me too. - Yeah. - I'd just always thought it'd be like it is in the movies, you know, like I'd be all right up in the center of it. But instead I'm just watching it get reported on TV, just like every other event in my lifetime. - I just realized I'm gonna die without ever fulfilling my dream. Eating pizza alone in a bathroom, that's my dream. - Where are you going? - Back to work. - What are you talking about? - Man no one's gonna hear any new music we record anyway, we might as well die happy. - Yeah exactly, I intend to. From where I belong in front of a microphone. I'm not doing this for someone else to hear. For the first time in my life, I'm not doing this for the critics, and I'm not doing this for the reindeer. I'm not doing it for the hot air balloon riders or the b-ollies. I'm not doing this for the Kleenex manufacturers or funnel cakes or the salesman, or the diapers, or the figs, or the stockrooms. And I'm not doing this for the awnings, or the porch furniture, and I'm not doing this for bi-monthly magazine subscriptions, and I am definitely not doing this for the ellipticals! This is for me. I'm finally able to stand up and say I'm a man in a band, a man band, okay who's with me? - One track before the apocalypse, it'll be tight but let's give it a shot. - No Davy, we're starting over from scratch. We're gonna go in that room and you're gonna hit record, and we're not gonna stop until we finish an entire fucking album. Can you handle that? - No, no I can't. - What? - I've been letting people push me around my whole life. My wife, my kids, you guys, those Girl Scouts who sell me Tagalongs when they know I have diabetes and I can't do it anymore. You've been running your vocals through the LA2A for compression right? And they should be going through the Heurig 1176. - Sure, whatever you want. - What, no! I'm finally standing up for myself. First time in my life, so before the world ends, whatever you need is for you to put up a fight and then to still win. - Uh yeah okay, I guess we want the LA2A. - No, it's too smooth. It's all wrong for your voices, it makes 'em too rounded. The coloring of the 1176 insummation, if we don't use the 1176, I'm leaving. - Great, 1176 it is. Now go over there and press the big red button please. - One, two, one, two, three, four. What the hell just happened? - You think the aliens took out our power supply? - No power on the board. - Nice try guys. Maybe it really is time to quit. - Don't you understand what don't give up means? It doesn't mean give up when you die. It doesn't mean give up when aliens or an electromagnetic pulse from a nearby nuclear explosion takes your power out. No, it means don't give up. - Davy, maybe you've got a generator or something. - No, nothing. But wait, in my garage, I've got an old bicycle and sewing machine and silk screen print. Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking? - I'm not getting eaten by aliens 'cause that's all I've been thinking about for the last hour. - Before we get there, I think I just might have the solution. - Oh Tina look, what in the... - What is it? - This is a pedal powered generator. Now it's not gonna run everything in the studio, but it should hae enough power for the sound board and mics, for the TV, the FX routers, the amps, the lights, the answering machine, and the essential oils diffuser. - So what are we leaving out? - The coffee maker. - No! - It's okay Lance, we're running on adrenaline, we should all be dead within the new few hours, we should be fine without coffee. - That's probably true. - Also there's no power to the internet. - Oh! - Come on. - Guys it's just a sacrifice we're gonna have to make for the music. - Shut up newbie, you don't know anything about sacrifice. - The hell I don't. I've sacrificed everything for this band, and you've treated me like garbage for the past 16 years. - Calm down newbie, just relax. - Stop calling me that. I joined this band six weeks after you guys. I've played on every song, I've been in every music video, I've been on every TV show with you guys, do you guys even remember the name of the guy I replaced? - Josh, James. - Oh yeah, the old guy. - That's what I thought. And this isn't just about me, I'm standing up for Jason Newsted, John Frusciante, Eric Carr, and every non Beyonce member of Destiny's Child. We demand respect. - Fine, you're right, I'm sorry. So man, what do you think? Should we use this power pedal idea, even though it means no coffee and no internet? - Yes, yes we should. - Who's gonna pedal the bike? - I screwed up my knees in college. - I thought you guys would never ask. - You're like a professional cyclist and you didn't just think to volunteer? - I did not. - Okay Janet, it's up to you. Ride on lady. - Yeah. - Ride on. - I just realized something, but I don't think you're gonna like hearing it. - Great, don't tell us. All right, tell us. - Okay, all the crazy shit going on. An alien invasion, nuclear attacks, a toilet that got a top notch rating from consumer reports getting clogged, a perfectly healthy gold fish dying, non of it's natural, all of it's connected. - You're right, I installed that toilet myself, ain't natural. - I thought you didn't believe in that supernatural stuff? - Yeah, until I watched one of my bandmates literally come back from the dead. - That's when it all started happening. - Are you saying what I think you're saying. - No, I'm saying bringing Johnny back from the dead threw the whole balance of the universe out of whack. And it's just gonna keep getting worse until all of us, maybe all of existence, is annihilated. - The debt must be repaid. - Jesus Christ lady, you're gonna get paid for your pizza. It's a lot more at steak, the universe, my friend. - Hey guys, so the sink is the bathroom is dispensing blood, so if anyone's thirsty, I'd stick to whiskey. What are you guys looking at? - Johnny, I got some... - No Tina, if you start Linda McCarthying him right now, I swear to God, we'll never get this album done. - You think I don't know what you're doing? You're accusing me of Yokoing, but you're just too chickenshit to say her name. - What, no, I mean. - Yes you are, it's 'cause I'm Asian isn't it? - It's not 'cause you're Asian, it's 'cause you're a woman. - Do you realize that Yoko met John in 1966 and transformed him from let's hold hands, please, please John to Mother, Julia, God, across the universe give peace a chance John Lennon, and then maybe the world is a shit load better for him having had her in his life? No, anyone? So fine, watch me Yoko if that means occasionally wearing quirky hats and telling a guy named John the truth so he can have a chance to deal with the real meat of his own existence. Johnny, we kind of messed up. - Well Tina the good news is you're gonna be at the center of the apocalypse, just like you'd always hoped. - I'm sorry everyone, I should have never brought Johnny back to life. And before that, I should have never killed him either. - That one was at least partially my fault. - You're famous, you can't help yourself. - You know what, let's stop this jibber jabber and get back in the studio. - For what? - Because there still time on the clock. And I don't know if I've made this clear, but I am not ready to give up. - Get the fuck in the studio and start recording now! ♪ You're telling me that we've got tickets ♪ ♪ To the fundraiser ♪ ♪ But I'm thinking of faking a sickness baby ♪ ♪ Do I, do I, do I have to go with ya baby ♪ ♪ Can I, can I, please just stay home nap and jerk off ♪ ♪ Baby don't throw away the thoughts of cable ♪ ♪ 'cause I might need some of them someday ♪ ♪ Has anybody seen my car keys ♪ ♪ I, I, B, B, S, S ♪ ♪ Girl stop it, I want you to fake coverage ♪ - New Guy, what the fuck is that?

And one year since they emerged from total obscurity and re-dubbed themselves the Heart Condition Guys. Welcome men. - It's great to be back. - So tell me, what's the secret to your success? Maybe the newbie can answer. - Actually, newbie's got a name. It's Noogie, Noogie Rodriguez. - Okay Noogie, tell us about this album. - Well we're all pushing 40, so we figured we should start acting like it. And if only other old farts wanna listen to our music, then so be it. Plus no one under 35 pays for music anyway, so fuck 'em. - And I was told by my producer, that we're gonna drop your newest single right here on WZHJ In The Morning. - Yeah, this one's called Ice Cream, Netflix, and 16 Minutes Of A Movie.
