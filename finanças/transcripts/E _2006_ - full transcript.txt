Why do you want to go to E's house? We are from Bombay. And we are not going to E's house. We have newly shifted to the house opposite to E's house. To Munuswamy's house? - Yes. Who is E? I heard he is big criminal. And he can never be trusted. I heard that he will steal ear rings of small children. Is it true? Do you know him? Yes, people used to say that. Hey Tony...

That's not a big deal. I know every pawn broker in this area. Almost all items are in the pawn broker's shop. Get moving, I will be back soon. E... - Come let's go. Just 5 minutes, I will be back in 5 minutes. Why is he running so fast? He took my chain and ran away. Who is he? Don't you know? He is E. - E? If I had told you before, he would hit me in my house. I thought of telling you after he leaves, but he ran away with the chain. Give me my money. I have to leave. Ganesa, this is the chain. This is the photo copy of the chain. This is made in Bombay. How did you get it? Didn't I tell you? He is very clever. He is brilliant. What matter Just made another copy of it. That's all, ah? Just like this. I will make a better one than this. I said just like this. Leave this to me. Come when my brother is not here. He is my first enemy to come up in life. Do this first. And your future will be very bright. I must put up a shop just like this in the opposite street. Follow our foot steps. Start a jewellery super store here. When should I come? I will make it soon. - Give that to me. Take care of the photocopy. Make it look just like this. Come, let's go. He will meet a dusty death. You should have been careful. Poor girl. You got cheated. What happened? You warned me several times. But I didn't know that he was E. I got cheated. I told you several times. He is a rogue & cheat. Despite my warnings... Who is that bad mouthing my grandson E? You were careless but now blaming E. Who is she? E's grandmother. Let that be anyone. Come with me. Let's lodge a complaint in the police station. He was helping us. So I thought he is a good man. Didn't I tell you to call me once after coming to Chennai? E is worse criminal than those in Bombay. An accused died in the lock up. And it turned to be a big issue. S.I. will be very upset. Sir... - I will tell him that you had called. What's the matter? E took away her 5 sovereign gold chain. Tell him. - Yes sir. He sells even a cycle chain. Now a gold chain? Write a complaint. Here it is. Where would E be now? If he had sold it, he would be in the wine shop. If not, in the pawn broker's shop. Come. Sethji... I didn't know that you would make money by selling the chain. So, I stole one of the lamps. That thought struck me too. What would they do with a single lamp? So, I stole that. Cheers. We were right. What will a Muslim do with a lamp? It must be with the broker. Are you fine? - Yes. This is separate. - For sales. A girl from Bombay has shifted to our place. She wants Rs. 4000. Take the interest amount and give me the money. She will take it in 4 days. Give me the money. How much do you want. - Rs. 4000. 6 sovereigns of gold. It would cost you around 20 grand. He charges high interest. Sign here. - Not a big signature. Three lines & 2 dots. Take this Rs. 4000. Count it. The bill please. This is very important. Get up & come with me. Just hold on. Arresting him without a warrant. Come. What's happening? How many times to tell you? The new S.I. will beat you to death. Put him in. Take him too. I'm innocent. He came to pledge it. Why befriend a criminal? Get in. You know me very well. You take him in the jeep. I will come on the scooter. Will you come? - Yes sir. I will buy a tender coconut and come with him. Come to the station. S.I. will give you a big tender coconut. Sir, tea. - Sir, E. Sit down. Sir. They are killing me. Give me a tea. - Take it. Let's tell them about the lamp too. I'm very scared. We even don't know why they brought us here. What's the case? He stole a chain from a girl & was caught red handed while pledging it. Where is the girl? Come inside. Sunita, come with me. Come. Tell me what had happened. We have shifted from Bombay recently. I asked him to mortgage a 5 sovereign gold chain. He took it but never came back. Sir, yes I took chain from her. To help her, I mortgaged it for Rs. 4000 with a pawn broker. I have the bill. Head constable has the money. And the pawn broker has the chain. Ask him if you want to. Lamps aren't there in the case. Where is the pawn broker? It's me. Is he telling the truth? Yes, E is telling the truth. You beat me believing them. First put them in jail for lodging a false complaint. I heard that you buy stolen products. No sir. If I catch you, I will rip your skin apart. No sir. Go. Under IPC, 100 criminals can escape from law. But an innocent should not get punished. You know, don't you? You beat us without knowing the truth. Did he smile now? Who knows? You cheat! Come outside. Get money from the head constable. My stomach is upset. You go. I have to go to the toilet. E... - Why are you calling him? You keep quiet. I have to talk to him. Get me a cup of tea. - I'll serve tea only if you pay. I will make you run nude. Sorry, I committed a grave mistake. It is common. Why do people talk bad about you? Why don't you take up some job? I've got a job in the corporation. Spraying mosquito fumigation. Jobs have no respect. What are you doing? I work as a dancer in a hotel. This is my hotel visiting card. Mention my name & come at anytime you like. Is this any Udupi hotel? No. A star hotel. On me... On me... Move... Atlast, you have a job. You call this a job? I've lot more to do. Move... E, what's all this? Just like that. Let's go & have some tea. Come, let's go. Look after this. Buy me 2 idlis. I don't have money. Manage it yourself. S.I. is not a strict man. Just trying to show off. He wanted to be posted to a different division. But was posted to this area. Bribes in this area is meager. So, he wanted me to talk to you. What should I do now? Sell drugs, make spurious liquor or even run a brothel. Pay bribe to the station. Get 2 cases every month. Send your friend Tony to the court. Why are you giving me small ideas? Don't tell me anything where I will be under police watch. Tell me something where I will have control over the police. Hey E, come here. Please get that ready. I will give you a share. E, you break sugarcane in different styles. Show these girls how you do it. I'm fire spitting lava... I'm mercury nobody can catch... I'm flying train... Half of my life is spent in jail... I'll risk my life to achieve what I want... I'm not a slave to anyone... I stand on my own legs... I'm not a slave to anyone... I stand on my own legs... I'm fire spitting lava... I'm mercury nobody can catch... Filling ditches we laid new roads... Cleaned the drains... There's no one to clean our lives... There's no one to wash clean our minds...

We live in dark homes without light... We have become counterfeit currency... But still don't know, why? We don't know how to explain it. But still don't know, why? We don't know how to explain it. Tomatoes... we are golden tomatoes... Give money listening to the young boys' song... Tomatoes... we are your tomatoes... We are tomatoes without a roof of our own... Violence is part of our life...

If you pay the value in cash, it will be very helpful. Okay, give it to me. E, you've committed a mistake. You've handed him over to police. If you'd killed him, I would've paid millions to you. What are you saying Doctor? You should've killed him. That's our fortress. If I hadn't saved Doctor, he would be dead by now. I think there's something really fishy behind that doctor. This is the right place. Nellai Mani will be produced in Court tomorrow at 11 am. We'll kidnap him and come straight here... Move... just pigeons. We can keep a watch on him from down if we tie him here. He can't escape from here. He'll be within the eyesight. If you'd killed him, we wouldn't be facing this trouble. We would've got millions from the doctor. That's where you make the mistake. If I had killed him, Doctor would've settled it with few thousands of rupees... We can kidnap him from the court and bargain with the doctor. We can get a better price. - You're great. Whatever is happening, is happening for good. Whose vehicle you've booked? Our Qadir's. He's coming with a Maruthi van. He's very loyal, we don't have any other choice. Is my plan okay? - It's okay. Anyway two constables will accompany him to the court. One of them is Selvam. He's a sissy. You take him out for a tea. I'll manage the other guy. Be careful, we have only one plan. If we manage to pull it off, we'll hit the jackpot. Be ready, I'll come with Nellai Mani. Qadir is ready. Just two gates, we must take him out from the second gate. There are lot of police here. Looks he's a big shot. Accused is very dangerous man, be careful. What's all this? Is Sankaracharya coming to the court today? Get the accused out. Why are you masking my face? Police say you're a terrorist. Why are you killing doctors only? Please ask one after the other. Any enmity between you and Dr. Ramakrishna? Please ask questions after he comes out of the court. - Move... move... You beat me, right? I may not come out. But you'll come in, I'll see you then. Police Quarters, Chennai. Quick. What are you looking at? Remove the good bulb and replace with a fused bulb. Crime rate has gone up, it's robberies everywhere. Only police quarters is safe. Not a thief can enter this place. You removed good bulbs and replaced with fused ones, right? Yes, I've changed, keep the good bulbs separately. Move the ladder. Police is weak unlike the Military. I was suggesting this for long time to earn money. But you were planning something else. Did you see him in the court? That doctor is dead. Shut up and push the ladder. If we had kidnapped him as we planned, would we be doing this job now? Just Rs.6000? He said Rs.250 for a bulb but gave only Rs. 150. What can I do? What happened to the Bombay girl's chain matter? After bulbs, next is Bombay girl's chain, that's why I'm changing my dress. I'll act like a good boy and trap that girl. Hello. Love is an art... Caress me... ... and let lust flood us...

He might steal your fake jewels too. Shut up. Why talk unnecessarily? What's the collection today? - Today's collection is very less. Rs. 15000 in total. Deducting charges of room boy, orchestra and my share, your share is Rs. 4500. Take this Rs. 4000 and get my gold chain back. Such guys will be good for a couple of times. After that, they will cheat you. She herself is a garbage. And now she is complaining about me. Who did you call as garbage? I'll return the money tomorrow which you gave me yesterday. Did I ask you? Give it tomorrow. - Okay. What is he saying? He must be mesmerized by our dance. What if he watches the special dance? This food is not enough. Asha, are you coming or not? Vichu is going on shouting. Okay bye. Bye E. Get lost. Leg piece! What? Asha was talking about some special dance, right? Is it dancing with very little clothes on? Very very little. Topless...? - Very very little. Nude...?! Don't shout. Yes, it is. So, that's what you call special dance, ah? Won't you perform that special dance? Shit! I don't have to earn a living like that. Rascal. I will tell you something. Don't mistake me please. If you perform special dance, the states will dance to your steps. The other day, you saw what happened. Good deeds are not recognized. First I must return this chain to her. Take it. You will be surprised. Match it with the original. They look alike. Yes. I can't differentiate the original from the duplicate. Give one chain to me. - Which one? Any one chain. - Take it. Who is the scapegoat? The pawn broker or that girl? I haven't decided yet. So, this must be the original. Even he can't differentiate the original from the duplicate. How will you find it? I can smell the real gold standing from a distance. - I know that. I've decided who the scapegoat is. Take care of the chain. I will be back. Stop. What is it E? - Hi Peter. Why did you stop it? You can't go straight. They have dug a pit hole. Turn left. Where are you heading to? - To Adyar. I'll get down on the way. Turn right. I was coming to see you, Jyothi. I've taken the chain back. Take it & be careful. Thank you very much. Stop here. I saw E stealing them. I can say this in any court. What are you doing, Jyothi? What are you doing? Leave my hand. Sit. - Go fast. Go... What are you driving? Who gave you the license? - E, please leave me. Stop it. Listen to me. Turn left. There will be police. - I can handle the traffic police. Stop it. E is here, sir. Catch hold of him. What happened? How dare you steal the government bulbs? - Beat him.

Welcome to the central jail... With a traitor right next to me... I've been to jail & felt bad too... I've been to jail & felt bad too... Welcome to the central jail... Why are you silent? We didn't hand him over to the police. He stole the government property in broad daylight. I have doubt on your chain too. What? - I have a doubt. What doubt? It might be fake. Can't you think positively? Can't you think negatively? I know him very well. I'm sure that this must be fake. Shall we check that? This is made of pure 24 ct. gold. Sometimes, even original will look like duplicate. Don't get confused. Take it. Hey Jyothi... Asha, I'm going to get him out on bail. Don't get cheated because of this incident. Whatever it is, he is good to me. I like him. Infact, I love him. How is ice cream? - Buying me an ice cream...? E, please accept the charges. If you don't, the magistrate will prolong the case. I live in Ambattur. I have to come all the way from there. We will see. You could have booked me under some other section. I see only my men in police station and in the court. Saints come here very rarely. Only a few are caught. Others are out there. We'll see later. Ask the Commissioner to wait. How come you are here? What's your crime? Forget about me. Why are you here? Those girls were caught under brothel case. There is no one to get them on on bail. I'll get them out on bail. Select the good looking ones and involve them in prostitution. If I don't get girls, I come to the court. He knows that. Only in our state, prostitution is an offense. But there is no law in Calcutta & Bombay. No law under Indian Penal Code. Even beautiful girls come to court. But I need to be patient. So, beautiful girls also come here. - Yes. What are you doing here? I'm here to get you out on bail. It costs lot. Got money with you? Yes I have. The chic looks great. Just for one night. We can finish the deal. Take it. Magistrate has come. You come fast. You go. I'll be there soon. Magistrate has come.

Hasn't my grandma come? She is not feeling well. I'll come for you. But don't drag me to court often. Hungry dog dug the garbage. Drive properly. Tony, let's fool the pawn broker. So, this is the duplicate one. - Yes. come. I need Rs. 3000. Not for me. For her. She came & asked me. I didn't want to come to you for this. Because police caught me for this chain. Even I mistook you on that day. Now I'm ready to give you Rs. 3000 without pawning any jewel. Repay it later with interest. Because I want to help the one who wants to reform. No. I don't want. What do you say? - You are right. You're of my father's age. Who knows you might even be my father? To Mount Road...? Check properly. Rub & see. Leave it. I treat you as my son. Here is Rs. 3000. Okay. Thank you very much. You're the first man to pawn a duplicate chain. It's raining & it is good for my business. Yes. Get a strong tea for me. Go I say. Stop staring at me. Don't ditch me. Listen to me. It is for your good only. The girl who came to the court, who is she? Leave my hand. - It's okay. Leave my hand. You know that I'll do anything for money. She is so beautiful that VIP's will fall at her feet. You can earn around Rs.40000 to 50000 a day. Calculate the earnings for a month & a year. You will get 20% more. You can settle in your life. I'm trying to be good to her to get money when I need. This idea might backfire on me. Give him tea. Why don't you ask her? Ask her once. Don't feel shy. Let's see what will happen. Hello! What? I'm here to talk about our future plans. Tell me what is it. What's so hurry! You wear this too. - Give that to me. Let me wear this for a couple of days. It looks good. - Asha might come. Careful. - What are you doing? Don't beat me. Give it back. - Stop. You are very beautiful. You mesmerise me. You sing & dance in the bar. Hasn't any broker approached you till now? They must have. Many approached me. What did you say? I beat them with slippers. What? I've just one pair of slippers. Just listen to what I say. You came to court to get me out on bail, didn't you? A broker approached me. He said that you are very beautiful and was ready to pay Rs. 20000 a day. You calculate it for a month & a year. Think. Money makes life beautiful. Come down. Is becoming my pimp your future plan? Wait, I'll come. If I was born beautiful like you, I would've bargained for Rs. 40000. What to do, I was born as male and became stale. Look. Making money by selling your body is not life. Living for the one you love is life. That's true love. I love you. Only you. This body is for you only. So, true love is sharing your body and soul with the one you love. So, this body is mine for free, right? I will beat you. Free...? I'll beat you. Get lost. Are you going to get back the duplicate chain? You won't get more than Rs. 300. What do you want me to do? - Are you mad? Just watch the show. Greetings! - Please sit. Take Rs. 3000.- Here it is. It doesn't look like mine. What are you saying? It is yours. Are you drunk? If I'm drunk, I can find it without even touching the chain. Tony, I think he is trying to cheat me. Check it. Yes, it is duplicate. Are you playing with me? Give it to me. - Give it. Rub & see. Check properly. How did this happen? Rub properly. Didn't I warn you that he is a cheat? This is not okay. Tony, come out. He is trying to cheat us. Who was with us that day? Yes. Qadir was with us. Qadir come here. - Don't call him. Leave my hand. What's the problem? We mortgaged the chain for Rs. 3000, didn't we? He is trying to cheat us by giving a duplicate chain. - Is it? Trying to cheat us? - No I won't. Talk in Tamil. - No, I will never do that. How dare he cheats us also? I thought you have reformed. So, I paid you money without checking it. It's the receipt given by him. It clearly states the value of the jewel. You will get caught if I go to court. Take 2 photocopies of it. No E. I will give you a couple of thousands. Couple of thousands for a jewel which values around Rs. 20000. If I take the money you are offering me, what would the public think of me. They will think that I'm a fraud. I thought you will be good to me. Asking me my one year's earning. Stop talking. Call the police. - No. I must lodge a complaint to the police. What did the S.I. say on that day. He said he will rip you apart if he gets any complaint on you. Will you give me money only if he rips your skin apart? Yes he will. - You keep quiet. Tell me here itself. I want to talk to you in person. - For what? How could you do this to me? And the receipt? - Shall I give it to him? Poor guy! Give it. What are you looking at! He is helping the poor by offering low interest rates. Sell idly. Ply auto. Work hard & earn. Just like me. Now do you believe in God. - Yes I do. Bye. You are a big cheat. Let's commit a mistake once... And let's commit is properly... Let's lie once... And lie more to cover it up... Borrowing & cheating are the same... When borrowed money is returned, it is good... Else it is called cheating... When borrowed money is returned, it is good... Else it is called cheating... Let's commit a mistake once... And let's commit is properly... Hear things wrongly... Lead a life by wrong doings... Try to come out of your wrongs... Love is a hymn... It imparts knowledge... A boat can't sail without water... For the mistakes committed... Love came into existence... Let's never do such mistake and regret later... Let's commit a mistake once... And let's commit is properly... Is rain also a man? It is trying to caress you with the rain drops... There are drizzles but our bodies are still hot... Lend me a match stick to make fire... Else lend me your nose pin... Long live anxiety... Long live our desires... Love live love which steals hearts... Long live eyes... Long live the dreams... Long live the breeze... Let's commit a mistake once... And let's commit is properly... Let's lie once... And lie more to cover it up... Borrowing & cheating are the same... When borrowed money is returned, it is good... Else it is called cheating... Once more... When borrowed money is returned, it is good... Else it is called cheating... Ayesha... - My dear... Take her to the hospital. Catch an auto. Oh my God! What happened to my daughter? Sister, see what's wrong with her. Don't worry. Fast. Move aside. Open the two door. I'll take care. Hello doctor. Ayesha of Singaravelar Nagar under our treatment has got admitted in our hospital. Very good. When? - Just 10 minutes back. Who is near you? Her entire family. E brought her to the hospital. I'll give it to E. Hello doctor... E, I will tell her to give the treatment. Ask them not to worry. How is your grandmother? - She is fine. Give the phone to her. Hold on. Hello. Don't give any medicines. Check her pulse rate. I will be there in an hour. Sign here. Here too. Lilly, give her 10 ml injection. Increase the dose by 3ml every 30 minutes. First, fits will stop. Allow them inside. Tell them that she is ill with some known disease. Send all the reports to my project centre. Okay doctor. Will she survive, doctor? How can she? Very difficult. Whatever it is my research is a grand success. How could you do all this as a doctor? Did I ever claim myself as doctor? My profession isn't Doctor, it is International Business making billions of profit. What if the patient's relatives come to know the truth? What? This thing! Do you know how many researches have been conducted in India? Even educated are ignorant. How can these filthy illiterates know it? without the knowledge of my senior doctor. I've sent healthy people to research centres as heart patients, You know that? I've used good healthy people as guinea pigs for research. In 1994 Dr. Bhattacharya of Mumbai, promising to find a cure to AIDS, he was injecting virus extracted from a dog to 9 boys and a girl. They weren't cured of AIDS but a boy died. Court, Police or Law couldn't take any action on Dr. Bhattacharya. Because it's a research. Is medical business so profitable? This isn't medical business, this is weapons business. Earlier people died fighting each other with swords. In WW1 people died in hordes for the bullets. By WW2 atom bombs were developed, and people died in millions. The next war will be fought with biological weapons. It's a Bio war. Who is it? Nurse? You look like Jyothika. Why are you giving a shot of injection every month, give her three shots at a time, Shut up. - Grandma. Give me Rs. 50. What is this? Research. All over the world this medicine, even in developed countries, after testing it on animals, have warned not to test it on humans. But still you've tested it on a child, that too giving her a heavy dose. Better know this first. Doctor is a profession. Pharmaceuticals is a business. Doctor is unlike all other professions. People consider them as Gods not as businessmen. Shouldn't you be humane? For the billions of dollars offered by foreign clients, without the knowledge of Indian Government, without the knowledge of people, you're doing research on poor people. Educated and rich people will inquire everything. But these slum people are blissfully ignorant. Are they so ignorant? When hundreds of Black African people were used for Syphilis research, many died in the process, US President Bill Clinton in 1997, openly asked an apology for the excesses on behalf of the Government. You know it, right? In Britain insecticides were made as tablets, paid 500 dollars to every student in Manchester University for taking it, and used them for a research. I too know all this. You needn't get scared. I'm doing all this taking necessary approvals from the patients. There are just guidelines, nothing to prosecute legally. People will come to know it. Even after 100 years they will not know it. I'll also not be alive then. If people come to know you'll not be alive. You're interfering often in my job. All over the world I've money power, muscle power, political support, underworld connections. But you've only a wife, three kids, and an old father. That's all I've to say. Let this be the last time. I've lot of work. Now give her the last shot. Even adults can't take it anymore. - Try it. According to my calculations, the child will struggle for 10 minutes. Blood infusion start again, and then it will stop. Follow it correctly. What's this? Leave my shirt. Look at her. Leave him. Please keep quiet. Sorry sir... uneducated poor people. They are emotional people, please don't take it seriously. No problem, atleast you know it. - Come. You take care of them. You're not eating properly since the death of Ayesha. Hey stop... stop. Kanniyappa, start the vehicle. Sit here. Sit carefully. Carefully. Take me to Ramakrishna hospital, only he can save me from death. Even if you die, will I arrange your funeral cheaply? Won't I spend money lavishly to conduct it like a festival? I'll dance in your funeral procession. E, don't buy local brew for her death. I want a full bottle of good brand. Even if I die, take my body in Kanniyappa's tricycle only. Okay, you go now. - He may die before you. You take good care of my grandson. E, don't drink and roam. As if you're leaving wealth behind for me. I'm bothered about food after you go to hospital. Stop the tricycle. Grandma, you carry on, I'll come back in 5 minutes. Kanniyappa, look after her. You come. Come... come. Go... go to hospital, I'll join you there. You carry on granny, I'll come to hospital in 5 minutes. Greetings boss. Are you fine boss? I'm fine. - What's their problem? Tell him. We are third year students of Medical college. - Is it? Students? How is it? You look like MGR is film Idhayakani. Then? My friend loves a girl. Is it? After going steady with me, she ditched me for a rich boy. I'm also getting angry. This is concentrated sulphuric acid. Skin will burn on touch. Pride of her beauty is making her behave like that. Her face must turn ugly. Nobody should see her face again. You must throw it on her face. Did you love her or was it him? You're getting excited. She's Divya, you can find all her details behind the photo. Divya will be in Chemistry lab at 10 am tomorrow. We'll be outside. You throw it on her. Look how powerful the educated people's idea is. Get the details about rate and availability. Bye, boss. Rs. 8000, balance on completion of the job. Okay boss. - Will you do it? It's very easy boss. They have given such a small bottle. This will burn her face totally. Didn't you go to hospital with granny? This is acid, keep it safely. Make a drink. I don't know if there's stock here. We have. Take... take it. Keep it separately. You need money for granny's hospital expenses, right? No need, E. Don't throw acid on the girl's face as the boy said. Think about her life. What will life become with a disfigured face? I don't care about anybody, I need money. You're helpless without money, you know it. Please listen to me. Love is divine. Falling in love, swearing to live without each other, committing suicide on failure, I stay away from such madness. Love is pure and true. You'll fall only once in love. How can you understand it? Wastrels like you can't understand it. You may feel great for going out with any woman you like, only dogs behave like that. Oh No! Didn't I tell you not to entertain such girls? When? Whenever we are on threshold of success, they will spoil it with advice. An old woman is there... she sings Tamil songs also... K B Sundarambal too played her role. That's Avvaiyar. Avvaiyar! Avvaiyar is here. - Is it her? Take it. - Acting smart. Why are you silently watching her for throwing money? We are struggling to earn this money only. Do you know the value of money? How can you know it? You're a cheap woman dancing in bars picking up the money thrown at you. What? What did you call me? Am I cheap woman? You're a pimp who tried to sell me. Bloody girl... l'll punch you. Go away or else I'll throw the acid on your face. You can't dance to show your voluptuous body. Go. I'll go but if you throw acid on the girl's face, you'll get ruined. Go. - I'll see how you'll do it. If you stay here I'll kill you. I'll go but you'll come after me like a dog. Go... why will I after you if I've money. Are you a beauty? A bevy of beauties will flutter around me like butterflies. What's this? - Make a drink. You look like a college student. It's the age to be in college. But God didn't give you the opportunity. Is this also God's work? What else then? Okay, be careful. Don't open your mouth, they will find you're from slum. Is everything ready? Go straight and take left. Okay. Aren't you Divya? - Yes. Aren't you Parthiban's lover? - Yes. But you're going with some one else now, are you a call girl? Love is pure and divine. It comes only once, street girls like you can't understand it. You may consider it great to go out with anyone you like, only bitches do like that. What happened Divya? Look... open your eyes. It's just plain water, nothing has happened to you. Open your eyes. He's not a student. He's from a slum. Catch him... catch him... Hold me tightly brother... Save my life brother... Come up... Save me at any cost. Tell me... yes. Keep all records ready. - Morning sir. Get all the records about Nellai Mani. Doctor... doctor. - Yes. Good morning. Why are you afraid on seeing Police? What happened? I think Nellai Mani has escaped from the police encounter. Two armed guards at the entrance. - Okay sir. Looks like he'll not let you off the hook so easily. What are you saying? Who is it? Excuse me... sorry madam. Set up a road block at the entrance. If you want extra police, apply for armed forces. - Yes sir. Doctor, your home looks very rich. Didn't you kill him in the encounter? We tried but failed. How can a force that works for money can catch a man driven by aim? That means...? What's there on that side? Garden... entertainment hall... bar... swimming pool. Minister sent me here once for his son's medical admission. That's why... One guard here & keep the door closed. - Yes sir. Issue me a license for gun, I'll hit the bullseye defending my life than the police. All don't work for money, doctor. Nellai Mani has killed seven people. All were very famous doctors or scientists. Who else is on his hit list? Why is he doing it? There should be a reason... This looks like a diabolical plan... I want Nellai Mani alive. I'm telling you also, I want Nellai Mani alive. If a need arises, I'll talk to the higher officials. - Okay sir. Smile man. Is it Nurse Lilly? Go... go... go carefully. Stop... stop... if there's any drain near, push it through it. Why friend? Police dogs can't follow smell beyond water. Go quickly. Who is it? Head constable. - Check who is it? Yes sir. Police? - Yes... Hey. - Sir. Throw this in the dust bin. Don't get afraid. Who is it? You! Why are you taking the dust bin at night? Didn't I tell you about doctor finding a job for me in the corporation? That's why I'm taking it. Don't throw it, brother. Beer bottle will fetch Rs.2. Who is it? - Sir it's me E. Sir, received a message from the control room. About Nellai Mani... they want you immediately in Commissioner's office. You come man. - E, do your work. E, you carry on with your work. I'll see you in station tomorrow sir. Tony... Tony... - What? Wash your face and come to the our fortress. No time to sleep, come quickly. Just hold it for few moments friend. Nobody comes here, police too don't know about this place. You don't worry. This is my place. If it's very painful I'll get you a rum bottle. If you drink and sleep, you'll not feel the pain. I don't want. I'll stay in this corner. I can keep a watch on the movements down there. I think this place was chosen for me. No... we hide here when police turn heat on us. Is it? Come friend... sit here. Be careful. Lie on this. I've lost blood in the gun shots, You struck with a baton it hasn't healed yet. I don't know how long I can survive. Will you help me? - Tell me friend. I'll write few medicines, can you get them? - Yes. Go stealthily, police also shouldn't doubt you. Wipe out the blood stains on the steps. With these medicines, get a bottle of O positive blood from the blood bank I don't have money, manage and buy it. If I live I'll settle... What's this friend? You saved my life. I'll give my life for you. I'll go friend. E... give me that pipe. Come... come. That day we planned and missed in the court... Nellai Mani? I've kidnapped him. How? It's impossible. I didn't try, he came to me after getting hurt in a police encounter. You say no God, do you believe now? Okay... God is there. Take care of him. Nobody should know it. Okay? I don't have any money with me now. - Why? I must buy medicines, blood. Looks like he's going to die. If he dies, we can't get a penny from that doctor. He must be alive till then. We must kill him only after getting money from the doctor. If you need money, ask Jyothi. What for you've a lover if not to help in crisis? Correct. You keep vigil all night staying awake. If you need buy tea in a flask. Okay. - Okay? Hide that dust bin. Steps have blood stains. Wipe it clean. Okay? Madam... madam... Jyothi. What? - Isn't Jyothi at home? She's there. Please forgive me madam. - Why did you open door at night? He always cooks up new tales everyday. Why did you come inside? Go out. No... poor boy. You don't know who is he. You replaced acid with water and prevented it anyway. Please forget it. - Get out. I need urgently Rs.3000... very urgent. Granny is not well, I've to buy medicines. Trust me. I swear on your mother, I need Rs.3000 urgently. I need to save my granny's life, please get it from her. Please tell her. There's money in a box in the kitchen, bring Rs.3000 from it. It's in the henna box, right? Yes, bring it quickly. True... I need it urgently... won't you save a life? Bring it. - Take it. Go... go. - Thank you madam. Trust me I'm going to the medical shop. It's cold out there, please give me your shawl. Bye madam. I'll do that but your vest is full of blood, change it first. Okay, I'll change, you be careful here. I'm not suppose to give medicines without prescription. Hey, I know what you do without your boss' knowledge... Come on, did you get all the medicines? - Yes. I didn't have money to buy these medicines. My girl friend only helped me. First take that injection... Not that... take that one... Take the ampule cutter. Take that opener... Open it... extract that medicine... Fill the medicine. Like that. Inject it... Friend, I don't know... Give it to me... Take that scissor and that knife. A bullet brushed my shoulder. And a iron shrapnel tore my thigh I know... I saw it... That's not a problem. We can put sutures... But 2 bullets in my stomach. Ruptured my intestines. Oh my God! Pain is killing me... Hope I'll survive with your help. Wipe that blood... Stitch... put sutures to the open cut... What friend? Is this a cloth to stitch? Give it to me. Why are you doing I without taking anesthesia? It's been a long time since I lost my sleep. Even anesthetics will not help, I won't get sleep... Hang the saline and blood bottles over there. Even police is after me... But why such a huge police force is after you? We both are booked under different crime sections. Only local police is after you. But International police is after me! Police will always be after someone... It went after Gandhiji, Nethaji, Bhagat Singh... Now, they're after us! Friend, how come you're so cool? It's simple because I'm a Villager. I'll have more resisting power than you. Friend, are you a doctor? I discontinued my medicine. Why did you fire at that doctor? Political groups are barrels of the gun. Why did you want to shed blood for that? Politics is a war without shedding blood. War is politics with blood shed. I didn't get you! Struggle in life... then you will understand. I wished to become a doctor. Take care, friend. See you then... This is 'E' house. He is in Jyothi's house. He eats and sleeps there only. E, who are they? - Known people. E, how are you? Having a grand feast? Is she the Mumbai girl? She looks pretty. Why don't you marry her? Hey, give me that photo. E, I've come with a good offer. If you do it, not only you, we will also get a good share. Don't lose your power in this area. Otherwise you end up a vegetable seller like your grandma. The man in this photo is Nellai Mani. He isn't an ordinary man, an International criminal. Very good network is there to catch him. But no use. He escaped from the jail yesterday only. No information about his whereabouts. You should kill him. If you finish this job, we all can settle in our lives. Yes, doctor... I'm here only... E has accepted to do it. Okay then... See you then... Give it to me... Something is wrong with him... Keep an eye on him. Why do you accept to do such things? Hey, I didn't say 'Yes'. They came and gave this photo to me... I stopped taking such jobs after you advised me. That's it... What is this? - It seems it's a special camera. We will get snaps automatically. Automatically? - Yes. What should I press it? Click that red button. Don't make noise. Take a close up shot. - Okay? Stand here and take a snap of us. Be careful... Friend... Get up, my friend... You're sleeping without having food... Shall I get you something? Get tea and a bun... - Okay. That's nothing... it's flash of an airplane... I'll go and get it, okay? Go... - Okay Why did you flash a light? You said that don't make noise... Did you tell me to click without a flash? Peter and Durai gangs are searching for Nellai Mani... E's holding... no way. Let's go and see S.I. Lakshmipathi. Beeda Ravi's gang has started searching for him... We should be alert... Hey, be careful... I'll take the payment from doctor and come back. Don't drink and sleep. Doctor, call for you. Doctor, are you fine? Who is this? Forgotten me so soon? It's E! Oh no! I didn't forget you... Tell the matter... what do you want? What? Nellai Mani who tried to kill you is now in my custody. Really? - Yes. If you want, I can show you proof. Come here immediately. You know my address, don't you? Plot No:36, ECR road, Mahabalipuram. Protect Nellai Mani. I know, doctor. I'll come there immediately. Don't worry about money. Take good care of my grandma. Doctor, you're responsible for my grandma's life. And I'm responsible for your life. Don't inform police or goons. Because I'm the police and also goon to central Chennai. Hey stop... stop man... He will come this way only... be alert... otherwise he will escape... Hey, he is there... stop... Come on... Nice cap, man... Sir, I've bought it for Rs.5.- Get inside... Start the Jeep. What did the doctor say? He asked her to take rest. Grandma... Is it Jyothi? - Yes... I've been admitted here. Don't know what he is doing for his food? Don't worry about that. We will take care of it. He has started eating well than before. He hasn't come to see me... Convey my regards to him. Why grandma? I gave him money for your medicines. He should've bought medicines for you, shouldn't he? No. Atleast ask him to come for my funeral. Sir, this case was filed against Nellai Mani in 2004. Important evidence. Please note it down. Where is your S.I.? Gone out. He's expected back now. Sir, we have collected all the information. Full record of Nellai Mani is ready. What records? Last year 660 times we produced TADA, POTA detainees in court, but not a single accused escaped from the custody, that's the record of TN Armed Police. There is no way to escape from police firing. They've shot him 4 times. Definitely he would've died. Most probably, we will find his body in Cooum. Sir, let's search for his body in Cooum. It seems he has escaped to Nepal. Information has come from Madhya Pradesh. Hey, what are you here for? What's this, sir? I was the man who caught and handed over Nellai Mani to police. You should've rewarded me for that... But you've arrested me? Sir, leave me now... Let police search him all over India. And I'll also search for him. I'll find and bring him here. Ganesh, there is no chance of Nellai Mani going out of this city. I've information that he has hidden in an electrical box all his equipment in a leather bag. Search him every nook and corner with a dog squad. SP Kumanan of Prohibition Dept., his second wife wanted me to buy a beer bottle, urgent I've to go... Hey, sit there... go... No sir... Whether Nellai Mani is a terrorist or a criminal isn't an issue. There is some lurking danger behind doctor Ramakrishnan. It will be good if we catch Nellai Mani alive. Why is she calling me? For whom you're buying tea? For me only... A watchman's job... E asked me to buy a tea to stay awake on duty. I was waiting for you for a long time. Why? - Take it. What's this? This a foreign brand. Good quality. Got as a gift from bar. I brought it for you only. Let E come... He will drink this and badmouth me. Give it to me... - Okay. You're right... Where will you go and have this? There beside an old toilet. There? We have been drinking there for the past 10 years. That is our bar. Okay. You go there and start drinking... I've fried fishes for you. I'll bring it for you. Really? Are you sure? Jyothi, come... Good drink! I'm getting intoxicated slowly. You want to make it fast? Won't you drink liquor? I've stopped it. E took money from me to buying medicines. Didn't he say that it's for his grandma? Was it a lie? Your money wasn't wasted. He needs money to buy medicines for his grandma. He needs money to marry you. Jyothi, the words said in Holy Geeta and in stupor is same. Lord Krishna only showed the path. Lord Krishna gives life. Lord Krishna kills. Hey, are you giving making me drunk to get the truth out? That's not my job, man. - Sorry. There is no secret with you... E has locked a man inside our den. He bought medicines for him only. He has spent lakhs for his treatment. He can bargain more, only if he is alive. Before he dies, we have to get our settlement. And then we should kill him. All these days we were just doing small jobs. Only now, we have moved a level up. Started murders... he will do it. You leave this place... I've to be here to protect him. Go... Don't get scared. It is our area! I swear, I'm a loyal watchman! Sir, we have found a dead body near Cooum. We suspect it may be Nellai Mani... Get up... Oh no! Are you Jyothi? - Yes. E has told a lot about you. I'm alive because of your shawl and medicines. Full credit goes to you and E. Please escape from here... No it's impossible. If I escape from here, then Police will catch me. Only E's place is secure for me. No... Staying with E is dangerous than going out... Don't trust him. Okay? He isn't a good person. Please escape from here... Please believe me... Okay. Can you do me a favour? I'll do anything, if you're ready to escape from here. Near Perumbur Mill factory, there is an old Beedi factory. There, if you go to nearby street... There you can see an electrical box. Inside it, there is a brown bag. I'll escape from here only after you bring that bag. - Okay. Be careful... police may keep an eye on you... Will you leave this place as soon as I bring it? -Yes. Shall I bring something to eat? It's enough if you bring that bag. - Okay. Get up... - Did S.I. come? Come on. Sit... Hey, tell me... what happened? It was inside the box only... Sir, I didn't get you... Last night, I bought chicken biriyani to have after drinking liquor. By this time, it would've got spoilt. Hey, stop it... - Okay sir... I'll not spare you alive... Sir, I don't know what for you're investigating me now?! Who is it? Is S.I. there? - Who are you? Dr. Ramakrishnan speaking... - Sir, just a minute... MLA is out of station. Sir, Dr. Ramakrishnan is on the line. I just want to know about a rowdy of your area. Sir, what's his name? - I don't know his name. People calls him 'E'. - Yes. He is here only. What for? He has thrown acid on a college girl. What happened? Nothing serious, sir... Give the phone to him... Give him... What happened, E? Doctor, don't worry. Nothing serious... Give the phone to S.I. Doctor, warn him about me... He wants to talk to you... Hey, bring E immediately to my house. - Okay sir. Take it. Did anyone notice you? - No. I feel fine after seeing this bag. Now, will you escape from here? Because every minute here is dangerous to you. My life is full of risks only. Don't trust E. He will kill you... E can never kill me. He can't kill me so easily... A girl can easily reform any rowdy or criminal. But I failed in that... Wherever I go, my life is in danger... I'll be in risk if I escape from here. If I stay here, E will kill me. Even if they failed to kill me... I'll die shortly... In this situation, where can I go? Shall I bring the doctor? - Who? Doctor Ramakrishnan. He is a well known doctor in this area. He does free service. He helps the poor willingly. Good person. - Really? Will you bring him here? I'll bring him now. I'll come before E returns. Bring him here. I'll wait for him. Greetings, sir. Greetings doctor. You wait outside. I'll call you later... Brother, had your food? Don't make noise... Sir, I don't think you've rendered free services for poor. Take your seat... Didn't you ask me to kill Nellai Mani for lakhs? Now let's finalise it. How much you will pay me? Nellai Mani is in my custody. I'm a straight forward man. First pay me the advance... I'll deliver Nellai Mani's body to you. Take this Rs.20000. I'll settle the balance only after seeing his body. Well said! How much you will give me? 2- 3 lakhs is enough for you people to settle in life. But I'll give you 10 lakhs. Take this advance... Sir, I too wish to have a big house and police security. I accept your deal. Ask your S.I. to drop me... They always treat me as criminal. Atleast today let them drop me... Just to show-off... Hey Lakshmipathi... - Sir... Drop him at his house. Strange to see him praying. Don't know the reason for this. Hey... Hey, are you mad? Don't shoot me... E, got scared? Won't I get scared if you fire at me? Why did you doubt me? If I want to shoot you. I would've killed you when you hit me in the hospital. Do you know to fire? - No. How come you become a rowdy without knowing to pull trigger? It's a modern world... Why are you still depending on sickles and knives? Don't you want to upgrade yourself? Only after becoming an international criminal... You can earn more killing VIP's. You need more training... Shoot this one... Aim here... Okay leave it... aim me... shoot me... Hold it properly... shoot me... Will I give you a gun with bullets? Give me the gun... Give me... Help me to sit... I'll be back now... - Go... Where's Tony? How did he get a gun? It's coming... King is coming... move away... What man? - Why are you beating me? Eating my food and sleeping in my place... How much did you get to reveal the secret? You dog, are you cheating me? - Hey, no... He is firing at me... Who paid you money to reveal his place? Tell me... - I didn't reveal anything... Your lover Jyothi got me drunk to information. If she gives you liquor, why did you reveal the secret? Hey, stop... otherwise I'll kill you... Hey, stop man... Did you suspect your friend and call me a cheat? From now, you're going to suffer. I'll teach you a good lesson. - Hey, no... I'll show you my true colour. - Hey, stop... Patient will get scared... Let them be here... Give it to me... - Thank you... Come... Doctor, why did you come here? You will die... Doctor, save me... - What happened? Tell me... First leave this place... tell me... Doctor, please go... E, tell me... - I say leave the place... Shit! You stupid... I would've died by this time... Come... Go... hey, are you playing with me? By this time, Nellai Mani would've shot the doctor... And I would've been in jail. If doctor dies, who will pay me? All my plans would've collapsed. I was growing in my life. You loved me and spoiled my life. Hereafter if you do such things... What will you do? What can you do? You're greedy for money and not allowing Nellai Mani to get well. Hey Jyothi, you don't know... all are bad people. The one who got injured is an International fraud. That doctor is an international criminal. I'm 100% good, compared to them. Who is good? You? The entire town talks bad about you! Better leave Nellai Mani. Otherwise, you will be in trouble. Then I won't bring a doctor here... I'll bring the police! Hey look, I've forgiven you many a times... Now I won't spare you. Hey, are you raising your hand on me? Will you beat me? Will you? Beat me... Will you? I've been watching you for a long time... You're shouting like a street girl. You dog, did you beat me? You don't know about me. I'll show you who I am. You dog... you scoundrel... Hey Jyothi, you don't know how truly I love you... I'll definitely inform to the police. - Jyothi, this isn't a joke. Don't go to police... wait... stop Jyothi... hey Jyothi... Don't come near me... I'll stone at you. Look Jyothi, no... listen to me... Can't you hear? - No, Jyothi... Don't come near me... - Look Jyothi, no... Move away! You hit me... I'll show you my true colour. Hey, wait... stop it. Are you acting smart with me? Leave me... - Are you acting smart with me? How dare you go to the police? Show your pranks on someone else... I was giving your a long rope, I'll inform the police that Nellai Mani is in your custody. I'll definitely put you in jail. Love teaches us the value of life... We learn many things through our mistakes... Love is a desert... Moon appears even there... It was love at first sight... And both the hearts are filled with joy... Love is like a glassware... One should handle it with care... Love teaches us the value of life... We learn many things through our mistakes... Love is a desert... Moon appears even there... These are unplucked wild flowers and unaccepted love... Flies on open wounds are similar to improper sex... Life is like dry leaves flying in the air... Don't know where it will end... Life is short... so live every moment... Death teaches us the value of life... We learn many things through our mistakes... Love is a desert... Moon appears even there... Hey, call Jyothi... Call her... Have it, sir... Hey, I know when to drink liquor! Did I beg you for drinks? Call Jyothi... Sir, please stop it... - Oh no! Call Jyothi... E, what do you want now? Why did you come here? Do you have money? I want to eat... History is full of violence... Why the hell we encourage violence? Most of the dead in the earth are love failures... Love promotes tears and pains... Still love lasts forever... You fight for yourself in the battlefield... Love is also the same... Rs.15 lakhs reward to anyone who catches Nellai Mani alive or dead. Read it again. Rs.15 lakhs reward to anyone who catches Nellai Mani alive or dead. E, come with me... - What's the matter? I want to talk to you... Come on... This is my last request to you... Did you see the paper? What do you want now? Nellai Mani, who is in your custody, anyone catching him alive or dead. will be rewarded Rs.15 lakhs by the government. I know! Always you used to tell good news in sad tone. E, I love you... How many times will you tell me? We are going to get Rs.25 lakhs, aren't we? We are going to live happily... 25 lakhs alone won't make us happy. You shouldn't kill Nellai Mani. If you love me truly, This is my first & last request to you. I've already committed to kill him for 10 lakhs. As you said, if I surrender him to the police... He will definitely be sentenced to death. Anyhow, he is going to die... Why should we lose that money? If we take law into our hands and kill him... We will gain Rs.10 lakhs. You're not getting the point... I'm thinking correctly... But you people are confusing me... E, till now you did only small crimes. You were choiceless. There was no other go... If you want, you can reform now also. But if you commit a murder for money, Your future will become miserable. What are you trying to say now? Do you want me to lose Rs.10 lakhs for love? Money isn't an issue... It doesn't matter even if you don't have money. But after marrying a murderer, I can't live or even die peacefully. Till now, I haven't murdered or fallen in love. Both are new to me. After my grandma, I respect only you. What do you want me to do now? If you really love me... If our love is true... You shouldn't kill him! That's what you want, isn't it? Your love will win. I won't kill him. Believe me... Promise? I swear on you... I swear on our love... After seeing such an announcement in the paper, Everybody will start searching him, collapsing our operation... Do you know the value of my research? Visit my Research Centre once... Being an S.I., he is wasting his time over there. Did you consider police as rowdies? Only here, no growth in police department and in rowdyism. Foreigners are afraid to invest crores depending on you. Doctor, you can't buy entire Police dept. If I want, I can easily control all the departments in the world. But it's impossible to buy patriots like Nellai Mani who work for people. They always struggle for people... And are ready to die for people! That's why I'm asking you to kill him. Sir, I don't think Nellai Mani is with E. Find from his friend, Tony. Buy him liquor. Tell him that he will get a good share. Hey, be careful. Don't commit more... He will get confused... Commit in terms of thousands. First finish that job... I want Nellai Mani's body. At the earliest! Greetings, boss. Greetings. - Come, Tony... All these days, you've been friendly with E, haven't you? But now, he has tried to beat you. Is he your true friend? What can I say? It's a world full of cheats. Am I right? Give this liquor to him. - No boss... Oh no! no boss. I've stopped drinking. I've sworn not to drink. Yes boss... When a girl cheated me, getting me drunk. I quit drinking. - Have it man... No, boss... what's this, boss? - Hey, leave him... don't force him. That day didn't I give you a photo of Nellai Mani? It seems he is with E. No... I don't think so... Till yesterday, I was with E only. I didn't see anyone like that. Really? - Yes. Ask him... Oh no! Oh my god! - Hey, tell the truth... Hey, tell us the truth if you had seen him... - No... They will beat you to death. I swear, no one is staying with E. - Is it? You carry on... Oh no! - Tell us the truth... I swear, I don't know... - Hey, leave me... Boss, I haven't seen Nellai Mani at all... Oh my God! Hey, take him inside and ask him... - Hey, leave me... Hey Tony... what's all this, man? It's nothing, E. Yesterday Beeda Ravi's men beat me severely asking about Nellai Mani... I had severe body aches. I took tablets and slept here... Hey, did you inform them? Hey, don't insult me... how can I reveal it? All my childhood, I lived eating your left over food. One more slap, I would've definitely died. But wouldn't have betrayed you. You fool! If I was in your position, I would've betrayed. Why should I die for others? It's all because of Jyothi! She is a big nuisance to me! It seems she will put me in jail. How will she? Doesn't she love you? Love?! She is a big torture! Why did you come here? We shouldn't delay any further... We must kill Nellai Mani tonight. Yesterday I was looking for a way to kill him. I thought of stabbing with an iron rod, but I heard the victim dies very slowly. I saw a grinding stone somewhere around here... There it is. Come. Get the iron rod in the vehicle. Remove the sand. Go ahead. Remove the sand & shake the stone. Get the vehicle. It'll be 50 kgs, I must kill him with this stone. You were right. If you throw this on his face, he will die instantly. Fool! If his face gets smashed, they will deny that it is Nellai Mani's body and we might end up losing the money. We must throw it on his chest. I know that. I will take this stone to our den. You come with this vehicle at 2 am. We will kill him tonight and put the body in this vehicle. No one has ever finished a job successfully in a drunken state. Such jobs can be done only after having a drink. Do it and then say Stop. Where are you coming from? Jyothi, you don't know about E. If you go to police, he won't hesitate to kill you also. E will kill Nellai Mani tonight. And his dead body will get him money. If you can tolerate all this stuff, marry & live with him. Move. I know... you can't kill me. I knew that you brought me here to kill, and take money from that doctor. Anyway, I am going to die. You must get the money of Rs. 15 lakhs after my death. That's why I came with you. There are few rich people for whom you clean the toilets & drain, wash clothes, and also kill people for money. You kill someone for someone's necessity. Is this your profession? What do you know? Children sleeping on the platform, playing in the drainage, and eating the leftovers you will one day become a fly just like me. Pickpocketing, chain snatching, cut hands & legs... ...and even kill someone. But they will never be you. Stop lecturing me about life. My mother was a farm hand toiled to educate me. Not only our lives are like this. 99% of the world's population lives on platform with mosquito bites. That doesn't mean that we must become hired assassins. If you become a suicide bomber, it will bring freedom to this earth. One needs to be educated to become like you. Study the people. There is nothing bigger than that. Without food...? Get lost. Live for the people. And they will look after you. They will share their food with you. I won't trust people. And I'm not qualified for that. My mother came to this market without knowing the language or the place. She was young & beautiful. Don't they know that she is mad? People gave her chocolates, ice cream and a sari too. But I don't know who made her pregnant. My mom ate this state's food. And this state's blood runs in my body too. But blood has no value in this market. I don't know my father. May be I was born for this market. Somebody help me... It's okay my mother died, but she shouldn't have given birth to me. I took birth on the green leaves. Old lady selling greens brought me up. My grandma took a photo of my mother to show it to me when I grow. Look how beautiful my mother is even after death. Friend, I don't have the right to live with people. I don't know my caste, creed or religion. Even small children call me "Bastard". Not knowing your father is your biggest qualification. If you did, you'll have a caste and a religion. You would've become a caste leader or a religion fanatic. If you know your mother tongue, you will stick to that language alone. So, being an "lllegitimate child" itself is a biggest qualification. He is Dr. Ramakrishnan, a criminal. Yes. First he used to sell a Rs. 2 medicine for Rs. 200 & minted money. So he sold banned medicines in India and made huge profits. And now he gets millions from the rich foreign countries and test the medicines on the people without their knowledge. After testing the medicines on animals, he is testing it on our people. Now, medicine & virus are the most powerful weapons than an atom bombs. That's the most profitable business around the world. His business is to develop dangerous viruses & kill people. Like Sars & Anthrax. Viruses will destroy agriculture. Farmers will die. A 10 gm of virus can bring destruction more than what a 1 ton atom bomb. It will destroy our next generation. Since it is cheap, anyone can buy it. Even the local rowdies can spray the viruses on our people. Ramakrishnan develops those viruses in India. In the name of research, he lives with dead. He is mad. I must throw handbills after killing him. Let's kill Dr. Ramakrishnan to save the world. Only then, people will know about him. Will they really understand? They won't. They will even call us fools. These are the people who died in Dr. Ramakrishnan's research. Stop scrolling. I know her. She is Jyothi's brother's daughter. Really? She died because of him. If you hadn't stopped me from killing Ramakrishnan, she might have been saved. She is my grandma. She is admitted in his hospital. You've done a grave mistake. I won't mind anything. But if you get the body, I must get my share. Send a few policemen with me. Let 2 of you go with him. Others get into the car. Police have surrounded us. You go & search there. Even the rowdies are here. By now, E must have killed Nellai Mani. We must snatch the body before he hands it over to the police. Kill E if he tries to stop us. Because the body is worth Rs. 15 lakhs. We can make money only if we give the body to the doctor. You go this way. I will go this way. Come, let's go. Give me betel leaf. This will happen in our lives. Don't get confused. Rowdies will kill me for money. Government rewards Rs.15 lakhs for my body It's people's money. Only you must get it. What are you talking? Money is not important. I've a gun. What will you do? I will shoot anyone who steps in. How many will you shoot? As many as I can. Till I die. Why should we both die? One is enough. I'm already dying. Rowdies will hack me to death. If the police get me, they'll torture me. You kill me. Sir... - If you shoot them to save me, you will also be in their hit list. Ramakrishnan will win in his attempts. Do as I say. They are coming. I've thought about it. Put that down & take this. Shoot... Sir, I can't. I die laying my hopes on you. Stop wasting time. Shoot. They will fight for my body. But you must respect my sacrifice. Trust people. Be true to them. I wanted to tell you a lot. I feel bad for leaving you all. Okay. It's your first time with a gun. Aim properly. I shouldn't struggle much. I should die instantly. Ready... shoot. Ready... Wait. Down with profit making. Friend. This is a dead end. Let's go the other way. We must take the body before another gang comes. Come... fast. The body is missing. The body which E is carrying is Nellai Mani's body. Quick... Beat them & take the body. He is a good man. He sacrifices his life for us. Leave the body. Tell them to leave the body. He is like our leader. Take it fast. Make it fast. Let's go through market an take the body to our house. They shouldn't get the body. How dare you take our dead body? Come on E. We shouldn't lose the body. What? What? A warrior's life has come to an end. Though dead he will live in you... A death that defies death... Where were you born... Taking rest here... Have the bullets sang a lullaby to you? Has your bloodshed gone waste? Your breath will stand against cyclones... You're the man to change this decaying world... I curse myself for loving a man who makes money from dead bodies. I don't feel sad leaving you. But I'm worried for leaving a beast like you alive. Shit! Jyothi... She is going away... He is a good man. Don't take hasty decisions. She is going away. Tell her that you are a good man. Jyothi... Aunty... Tell her that your love is true. He is going away. What do you want me to tell her? Do we take birth to love, eat & die? How can I love her after seeing the life taking viruses? Such viruses must be eliminated from this world. And people must live in peace. This country must survive... You go on a rampage... Let your brain become your weapon to destroy evil... Work hard to shed sweat... It's a sin to let it go waste... Become Atlas to carry this world on your shoulders... Know whom you should protect... You are a missile... Our heart is a mountain... Where there is a will there is a way... Your will break the mountain into pieces... Where there is a will there is a way... Your will break the mountain into pieces... Save people. E... how come you are here? I have also learnt to perform operations. You sucked our blood. I want you see yours now. I will rip your intestines and check your fat level. I want to see your brain which calculates money all the time, And whether you've a heart or not. No E. I'm not E anymore. I'm Dr. E. Shouldn't I be honoured with a Doctorate? No. I will give you money. Rs. 10 lakhs. Rs. 50 lakhs... Rs. 1 crore. Come here. Come closer. Please don't kill me. Rs. 2 crores. Grandma, he wants to buy everything with money. Isn't there anything which can't be bought with money? My grandma is worth more than you. No. I beg you. Now come closer. E, please don't kill me. - I've no other choice. Only if you die, people will know about this place through paper & TV. Only then they will believe me If you don't die, people won't believe me. Stop. Inventions are made to provide a better living. To kill people, you don't need any research or development. No E. When people can't afford to buy medicines, why do you create medicines to kill them? When people are against war, why develop new weapons? When everyone is trying to eradicate dangerous viruses, why do you create them? To save the world, viruses like you should die. Rs. 10 LAKHS REWARD FOR CATCHING E ALIVE OR DEAD.
