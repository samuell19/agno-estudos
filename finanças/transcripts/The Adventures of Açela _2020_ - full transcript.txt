That's when my dad probably returns. I wish you stayed longer. I get bored often. But here is beautiful, why are you bored? There are not so many kids. I got no one to play with. Why? Where are the kids? There isn't any school at the village. That's why they are all moved to the town. They only step by at the summer break. Then, you are not going to the school? No why didn't you go? There is no occupation for my father at the town. Wish there was a school at the village so that all the kids would be here. There is something over there. Where is it?

We do not see why Because he is only seen to the good ones, as people say. Will you take me to the woods? No, not a chance. Why? Taleteller may seem to us. The forest is dangerous. There are monsters out there as they say. Monsters? Yes monsters, they wander around the woods and they kidnap kids. That's why. Then we go after sunrise and come before sunset, is it okay? That's fine only if we are allowed to. Not without permission. Yay, I get to see the taleteller. Let's get our permissions at once. Grandma, is there a taleteller at the forest? Have you ever seen him? Who said that there is a taleteller at the forest? Ezrak did. Grandma, can I go see him? No one has ever seen him so far. It is just a rumor. But granny, maybe I get to see him. Please let me go. But forest is dangerous, there are monsters at the forest. They are said to kidnap the kids who wander alone at night. Grandma, we will go there at daytime, we will be back before sunset. Nevertheless, it is impossible to see the taleteller old man. Whatever, I would like to go anyways. Only if you will be back before sunset ? Hooray! I love you grandma. We will set out early in the morning and be back before sunset. I am going to sleep right away. See you in the morning. Açela do you think will we see the taleteller? I have been hearing a mysterious voice since we got here. What kind of voice? Açela come to the forest. Come to the forest. Come to the forest.. Can it be the taleteller? I don't know, it can be a monster. What if the voice belongs to a monster? Then we would be back before sundown. Isn'’t there monster in the daytme? No, only the nights. What was that noise? I don't know. Let's run. Wait, it is a boar screaming. They do not harm. Okay okay let's go on at once. We get right back if there is no taleteller. Here we are. It's beautiful, there are birds and flowers and sun. Is he here? Taleteller we're here. Taleteller we're right here. Taleteller we're here. Taleteller we're here. Taleteller, taleteller I am here. Taleteller we're here. Taleteller we're right here. Taleteller we're right here. Come on let's sit down there and wait. Okay let's wait a little. Taleteller, come out from where you are. Taleteller, come out from where you are. Taleteller I am here. Taleteller we are right here. Let's wait a little longer. Taleteller Taleteller we're leaving. What was that? Come here kids. Taleteller! Taleteller, is that you? Yes, kids call me taleteller old man. Taleteller does exist hooray. Taleteller will you tell us stories? Of course, I have very good stories for you kids. This place is beautiful, do you live on your own? No, a lot of kids stop by to listen to the stories just like you. What kind of tales do you tell? A kind full of kindness. I tell tales so that kids end up loving nature, livings and people.Kids... So, are you going to tell us stories today? Of course, come and take a seat. Once upon a time there was a little village. There were two kids at that village. They were good friends, they got along well. Then one day, the rest of the kids... Açela Açela Açela Açela Açela, come to the forest. Açela wake up. Aren'’t you going to the forest ? I'’m coming grandma. Açela are you ready? I'’m here. Let's proceed right away. Ezrak, you know that I had a strange dream. What did you see? I saw the taleteller in my dream. You saw the taleteller in your dream? Yes I did. How was he? A very good person, friendly and cheerful. He was telling us good stories. Do you really think we can see him? I don'’t know. Let's find out. First one to the woods wins. Run! I won, I won! I won, I won! You always do Which way are we headed? Okay,Okay, let'’s go this way. Taleteller, taleteller! We are not that deep into the woods, he cannot hear us. Maybe he'’s here. We'’re almost there. Let's walk a little more. Taleteller, taleteller we're here. Taleteller we're here. Taleteller, do you hear us? Taleteller where are you? I think he can'’t hear us. Taleteller, taleteller are you here? Let'’s wait a little. If he doesn'’t show up we proceed more. Something is moving over there. Where? Over there. I didn'’t see anything. I think taleteller has heard us. Taleteller, taleteller we're here. Taleteller, taleteller where are you? I don'’t think we'll see him. Maybe he'’s not shown to us. I don'’t know. Let's wait a little longer. Taleteller old man is a kid? Taleteller is that you? Calm down I am not the taleteller. Then who are you? Yes who are you? I'’m here to see the taleteller, too. Did you see ? Yes, I have. He sent me to get you. But... But? He'’s so sick. We need to save him. Then let'’s get him to the doctor at the town. Yes taleteller, we take him to the doctor. Guys wait up. There is only one way to save the taleteller. We need to find a flower which heals the sick and prolongs the life. We need to find it and give it to the taleteller together. That is what he said. How are we going to find the flower? Flower? What is the name ? That flower grows in a cave at the top of the mountain ahead. Only there, however the mountain is high and the path is steep and only we, together, can go get that rare flower to the taleteller. Fine, what are we waiting for? Let'’s go immediately. What was that? Hey kids, just a second. Who are you? I am alien, the green alien. I'’m going to dance for you, are you ready? Yes we are ready. What'’s your name? OÖkten Mine is Açela, and he is Ezrak. Ezrak ? Yes What does Ezrak mean? My father named me. It means blue sky, clean leaf and water. What does OÖkten mean? My grandpa named me. Means smart, wise, hero, brave. What about Açela? A very rare flower. Is it easy to climb the mountain? Taleteller said there are steep paths. Have you seen him before? This is the first time. But I used to see him in my dreams all the time. A voice calls me to the woods. I came to the woods today. A door opened and I let myself in. It was like another world. Taleteller was laying sick. He sent me to you as if he knew you would come. He wanted us to bring the seething flower. Why flower? I saw the Taleteller in my dreams. It felt so real. I remember now, there was an old lady in the village. She used to tell that a voice calls children to the woods. Then the children who hear it, listened the tales in their dreams. So it is real. Still, my parents do not believe the Taleteller exists. I also thought it was only a dream. It is real. Not so many people believe. Because only the kids who behave right can see him. Mean kids who disobey their parents cannot. Maybe that is why they do not believe. Are we there yet? There is a little left. I'’m so exhausted, let'’s take a break. Yes me too. Let'’s get some rest here. We're almost there, but it is better to rest. Let'’s get the flower to the Taleteller before night. We need to do this before sunset or they will be worried about us. It will be hard to climb to the mountain, but we'’ll be on time. There is a rabbit, have you seen? Yes, yes there are two actually. They are beautiful. Let'’s catch them and pet. What was that? It came from this direction, I'’ll go check it. I'’m coming with you. Nothing here. I think it was a fox and fled when it saw us. Let'’s get on our way, if you rested well. Guys, the mountain'’s too steep. Do we have to climb? But we cannot climb, we will fall. Let'’s follow this steep path. Okay, Okay. We'’ll go that way. Watch out guys, rocks are falling. Step aside. Guys, are you okay? We'’re fine. Let us continue. Okay be careful. We'’re here. The cave is over there. We have reached the cave. Let'’s go in and get the flower. The sedum flower is up ahead. Let me get it. I'’m pulling it hard but it won'’t seem to come out. Let me try. Let me also try. I had sensed something strange already. That must be the reason for the taleteller asked me to go with you guys. We got the flower, now what? Now we will go to the taleteller old man. Come on then. Let'’s go back to the woods. We need to hurry. We need to be there before sunset. How do we get to the taleteller? Wait a minute. Taleteller old man we have come. Taleteller! We are here. He doesn'’t seem to heard us. Let me call. Taleteller, we are right here. We brought you the sedum flower. This place is beautiful, it seems as I dreamt. It'’s like another world. Yes I loved it. Everything is astonishing. Guys, taleteller is up there. Taleteller, we are here. Taleteller, we brought you the sedum flower. Welcome kids. Kids, thank you all. You made me happy. Hooray, taleteller got well. Taleteller what is this place? This is Wonderland. Taleteller, will you tell us tales? Of course kids, I will. Follow me. Have a seat, kids. I am going to tell you a lovely story today. Alright kids. I am going to tell. Are you ready? Yes we are. Are you all going to school? Yes I am going. Me too. What about you? Taleteller old man, we don'’t have a school in our village. That'’s why I don't. Why isn'’t there any? Is there a village without a school? There are only one school which is at the town. All the kids at the village have moved to the town, however we couldn'’t. Why is that? There was no job for my father. That'’s why. Then we need to take care of it. You have to go to the school. Education is very important. Is it not kids? Yes he has to and we all need education. Alright kids, let'’s move on to our story. Yes. There was a time, the old times where camels were brokers, mosquitos are barber and I was shaking my father'’s cradle. There was a sultan. One day, sultan called his vizier and said; take this 1 lira. You will buy a ram with it! I want meat from this ram, fur from the skin. Also I want the lira back which given by me and ram as alive. I'’ll give you 40 days. If you don'’t do this, I will punish you on the forty-first day! Vizier went to his room immediately. He started to brood by taking his head between his hands. How can he perform Sultan'’s wishes? Difficult, too difficult. Vizier thought till the morning, but he couldn'’t find a solution, a way. So he decided to travel to far countries with the hope of finding a solution. Immediately, he packed up. He left the palace before daylight without being seen by anyone. He took the road. He went near and far, uphill and down dale; but when he looked through his back, he saw that he took too little way. He went on walking. He came across a farmer. After saluting, he said, I am so tired. I have been walking for a long time. There is no strength in my feet. You carry me till the slope. From there to the village, I'll carry you. The farmer didn'’t even pay attention to this unfamiliar man'’s words. They kept on walking without talking. After a while, they came to a forest. This time, Vizier said to the farmer How about going into this forest as one and exit as double? The farmer didn'’t respond to these statements either. They walked again. Before long, they came in front of a house. A girl was standing in front of the door. The farmer said: Here is my home. Vizier looked at the house and said, your home is beautiful, but my friend, its rudder is curved. The farmer didn'’t understand anything from these statements. He was in low spirits. He didn'’t answer the Vizier. He entered into the home without looking at his face. Vizier was alone in the middle of the street. Desperately, he found the village room and he guested there. It was evening, so the farmer prepared for dinner. During the dinner, the farmer'’s 13-year-old daughter asked him: Dad, who was the uncle with a beard who came to the village with you? Her Dad said: I don'’t know him, my daughter. I came across him on the way today. He said lots of things to me. I didn'’t understand what he said. I didn'’t answer, either. Her curiosity increased. What did he say that you didn'’t understand? Then, the farmer said again: At first, he said that you will carry me till the slope. And then I will carry you from there to the village. I didn'’t understand why he wanted it. I got angry with him because I didn'’t even know him and he wanted me to carry him. I didn'’t even answer. Soon, we went into the forest. This time, he said let'’s go into the forest as one and exit as double. I didn'’t understand anything from those statements either. I got so angry, but I kept myself. Then, I arrived at the village. To get rid of him, I showed this place and said here is my home. Guess what he told me? Your home is beautiful, but its rudder is curved, he said. I got so angry. I went inside immediately and forced myself not to do something bad. Does the house have a rudder? Is he crazy? The little girl listened to her father'’s words and said: You did wrong, dad. Every word of that uncle has a meaning. Eat your meal and I will tell you what he has meant. The farmer, who learned the vizier'’s words' meaning during the meal, ran directly to the village room after the meal. He found the Vizier and said: Forgive me unexpected guest. I couldn'’t understand your words in the morning because of tiredness. My ears are hearing badly, by the way. I am very sorry. I thought during the meal and I understood what you meant. By saying, you carry me till the slope. From there to the village, I'’ll carry you. You meant that you speak till the slope and I listen. From there to the villiage, I speak. You listen. By saying let'’s go into this forest as one and exit as double, you meant that you suggested us to wander. By telling your house is beautful, but its rudder is curved, you meant that our daughter is beautful, but her nose is crooked, right? Vizier who listened to the farmer carefully said that that'’s true, but these are not your words. Tell the truth. Who taught you all of these? The farmer thought a bit and said: Nobody taught these to me. But the Vizier didn'’t believe him. When Vizier insisted on learning the truth, desperately the farmer told the truth. My little daughter that you saw at the door taught this. So, Vizier was curious about this little girl. Come on, he said. Bring that little girl and I will see her closely. She is more clever than us. I have a problem and maybe she can find a solution. Immediately, the farmer went to the house and took his daughter to the village room. The Old vizier who liked little girl and said: Your father is proud of you and he is right. Because he has a wise daughter like you. Everybody likes wise children. Seeing that you are very clever, find a solution to my problem. The little girl laughed. Thank you for your kind words. What is your problem? Vizier started to tell. The Sultan gave me 1 lira and said, take this lira and you will buy a ram with it. I want meat from its meat and fur from its fur. Yet I want 1 lira back and ram alive. The little girl started to laugh after Vizier'’s words were over. Vizier got shocked from this and said: Why are you laughing? This is a bad situation. If I don'’t manage to do this, he will punish me on the forty-first day. Do you want an old man like me to be punished? The little girl said: Doing these things are too easy, uncle. Don'’t worry. I will save you. Vizier who is rejoiced at these words said: Thank you, my girl. Tell me how I will do it. The little girl started to tell Vizier what to do. You will buy an un-sheared ram with this 1 lira. You will make wool from ram shears and sell for 2 liras. You will keep its 1 lira and with the other 1 lira, you will get a fur done. You will cut a piece from the ram'’s tail, put it to a plate and take it to the Sultan. Now it is done. Vizier admired the little girl'’s advice. He thanked the little girl and her father for being saved from decapitation and left the village happily. He went up hill and down dale, he arrived at the palace. He came before the Sultan and he carried out all his orders. The Sultan was satisfied, but he asked to whom he consulted. Firstly, Vizier didn'’t want to say. He hesitated, but when the Sultan forced, he had to tell the truth. And the Sultan wanted to see this wise girl. Immediately, they sent a car. They took the girl from the village and introduced her in Sultan'’s presence. The Sultan said: I learned that you are a very wise girl. Let'’s see whether you can show this talent to me too. If you can'’t show, you can'’t take the reward. The little girl laughed and said: I am ready my Sultan. The Sultan was shocked at the little girl'’s recklessness and courage and said laughingly: Well Done! You seem to be a very brave child. Now listen, you will make my mare give birth to two colts in 3 days! Now I will put 99 gold in this pot and seal its brim and give it to you. You will open it in front of me and take 100 goldens from inside of it! And also, I want to see you as a septuagenarian soon. In order to do all these things, you have only one chance, but your demand will include only 2 words. She lunged immediately and said: I will do what you want my Sultan. First of all, I will ask for a two words wish. The Sultan said, then ask. I will do immediately! The girl said, turn the sun off. The Sultan was surprised with this demand and shouted angrily. Girl! Are you insane? How can I turn the sun off? You must want performable things! Then the little girl said: While turning off the sun isn'’t performable, are your demands performable, my Sultan? The Sultan recognized the girl'’s answer and his anger passed. He admired the girl'’s mind and intelligence. He gave her father double oxen with a field as a gift and he gave her a golden handcrafted horse as a gift, so that she can ride on the way to school in the town. Then he sent them to the village in the care of his soldiers. Yes children and they lived happily. Taleteller old man, thank you a lot. We need to go back to the village. Can we come again to listen to your stories? Of course, kids. You can come whenever you want to. Are you ready to dance, kids? Yes Taleteller old man is a very good person. Yes. He has told us a very lovely story. Can we go to him again soon? Of course, we can definitely go. Run? Look at the crowd at the village! Yes, yes. Let'’s check what happened. Ezrak, did you see the school that has just opened? But, but, how could it be? Taleteller old man has helped us. Now you can go to the school. There is a school at the village. I can go to the school! There is a school at the village. I can go to the school!
