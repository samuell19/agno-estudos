These have been written about for centuries. Don't start this again, John. I will not hear anymore of it. Your delusions are almost in direct conflict with the teachings of the church. Well, I'm sorry your faith can't handle the challenge. I thought, as a man whose entire career was based on inciting fear, you would be interested in my theories. You cab will be here 5 p.m. sharp.
