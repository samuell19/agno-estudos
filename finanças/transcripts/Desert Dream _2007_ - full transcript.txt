The North Korean Foreign Ministry warned that they will test-fire its long-range missiles and prohibited finishing in some areas until the 11th of this month. An U.S. official said in an interview with NBC that North Korea is preparing an additional test-fire of ''Daepodong-Two''. lt is the most powerful missile ever produced by North Korea. Some reports said North Korea also plans to test-fire 3 to 4 short and long-range missiles. There is much speculation that the North Korean leader, Kim Jung-ll visited the test-fire site in person last Wednesday. Some reports says Kim Jung-ll arrived. at the site by his special train before the test-fire began. Mom, there's a wide road ahead of us.
