- Come on. - You can't catch this. You can't catch it. Told you, you can't catch this one. - Don't throw it hard! Here, come here quick! Geez, I've never seen anything like it. It looks kind of Patches and Dakota, don't it? I wonder if Mr. Payne knows. Gary, where you goin'? Come on chicken they won't hurt you. They're dead. Hey, Gary, wait up. - Hey, Jeff. There's an article in the Outlook here that says they found two dogs near the Sherman Canal in Venice that had been mutilated. Police think it's some kind of ritualistic thing, like those cattle they found in Colorado last year. - That sounds gruesome. They've got some very strange people walking around those canals. - No, it's like that German Shepard that I saw last week on the marina jetty, when I was taking pictures of the outrigger races. - Wayne, you said you found a dead dog not a mutilated carcass. - That's what was so odd. The thing looked like it had been butchered. It didn't look like an animal sacrifice at all. - Whatever that's supposed to look like. Wayne, come on or I'm gonna be late for work. - It was more like the flesh on Dakota had been sucked right off the bones clean, you know? - Will you hurry up or we're both gonna be late, come on. - It wasn't a thing of beauty, but I honestly couldn't imagine anything human doing what I saw. It was more like a piranha attack. - Wayne, do you realize that you've got a exam in your first period class today? Now what's gonna happen when you show up 10 minutes late? - Well, I'll scratch the first three questions, and maybe one of the kids will pass the test. Sometimes I wonder about our communication. I'm talking enigma and you're talking exam. - No, I'm not. I'm just talking about getting to work on time, okay. - Jack, wake up. Jack, I now you're awake. Now go see what that noise was. - Helen, I know what it was. It was that damn dog of yours. - Go be sure. - I'm sure. - Maybe he's sick or hurt. With this crazy business going on around here, who can tell. - Oh, Helen. It's 3:00 a.m. If the dog is sick, he can only get better or worse, and right now either one is fine with me. Christ, all right! But if that damn dog has broken through the screen again, that's it he's out! It's the pound! - Jack, I don't know why you have to put on all your clothes. You're only going to the living room. Wear that nice robe I bought you. - For 42 years I have gotten out of bed and put on my clothes. I detest bath robes. Why you bought it is still a mystery to me. Now, unless you want to go check on the dog, shut up! - All right. - Regal? Damn. Damn mutt that's it! - Jack, what is it? Is Regal alright? - No, of course, he's all right. In and out like a tornado. You're gonna have a mess to clean up in the morning. - Jack! Jack! - You know I couldn't believe that six period class. I mean, I've gotta be wasting their time because they're certainly wasting mine. There's a 12th grade group of kids that are supposedly headed for college, and some of them can't even formulate a sentence. - Well, they've been passed up through the prerequisites, or they wouldn't be there, right? - I know. The system forces the instructors to keep 'em moving, prepared or not, which is just another reason why I'm getting more turned off to teaching every day. - You're getting turned off, and then you're leaving the teaching to incompetents like your esteemed colleague, Mr. Blakely. No, the good teaches are bailing out, and then the Blakleys are just destroying young minds. - This good teacher is about to blow some young minds like when I fail half the kids in the Lighthouse staff. It's the worst high school newspaper in the state. - Ah. - Marti Mason hit me with her favorite simile again today, like a melted Popsicle in the sun. She found it somewhere, and I swear she manages to lose it at least once in every issue. - Mr. Connors! - Speaking of you know who. - Why me? - Mr. Connors, listen to this. - Now last night the Venice Beach. - It's about that article you read us in Outlook the other day. - In their small canal side home. Police police and spokesman Commander Phillip Reed released word today that an investigation is currently underway to find the individuals responsible for the mutilation murders of long time residents Jack and Helen Dunn. While this is the first such attack on the human populous, the police reported that last week a similar mutilation incident occurred involving several animals. - See Mr. Connors, that's what you read us. - Okay, Marti, I'll read the rest in tomorrow's paper. - Okay, Mr. Connors, I just thought it was kind of funny, you know. - Thank you, Marti. - Does she always listen to the news station? - Oh, constantly, especially in class, she's a teenage news junky. You know, I think I'll see if the Dunn's address is listed in the phone book. It might be, long time resident and all. - Why do you want the address? - I'm not sure. After finding that dog on the jetty, then those animals, now this, it's kind of interesting. - I think it's morbid. Wayne, there's a lot of degenerate people living around those canals. Why don't you just stay out of it? - Jeff, I'm just gonna take a look around that's all, and call it the old journalist curiosity. - Wayne, you are not a journalist. You're a high school journalism teacher. - After that class today, I'm not so sure. Look it's not going to involve me if I just drive by the Dunn's place. I mean, just drive by! Hello, anybody home? Hello? - Okay, wiseguy, spread 'em. Who are you and what are you doing here? Spread 'em! - Jesus, you scared me. My name is Wayne Connors. I'm a journalism teacher at the high school. I got identification. - Okay, show it to me. Slowly. - Okay. Here's my school ID, my LAPD press card, my driver's license. My new address is right there on the back. I got a gas credit card. - You know, Mr. Connors. These cards don't give you the right to break into a private residence. - No, of the course not. I just knocked on the door, and it swung open. I guess, somebody forgot to close it. - Well, a neighbor reported a prowler, and you're lucky that I got here before he did because he's got a loaded shotgun and he's just spooked enough to use it. Damn cold! - Gesundheit. - Yeah, whatever. - You should try of these eucalyptus drops. It'll make your eyes water, but they really work try one. Say weren't you involved in the initial investigation of this thing? - Oh, I was. If it hadn't been so damn vicious, I could've had the day off and probably gotten over this cold. - Well, those drops will help. But tell me something. Did the experts make anything out of this mud on the carpet? - Oh, they saw it, sure. Figured it was tracked in from somewhere around the building. It's damp down here in these canals, a lot of mud and water. - Did they find any footprints or impressions? - Hmm, I don't think so. They couldn't tell much from the mud one way or another. A little odd, I guess, but nothing too remarkable. Now look, Mr. Connors, I'm not going to arrest you. But I want you to stop prowling around. This area is off limits until the investigation is over. Do you understand? - I do, and thank you. I'm sorry I caused you any trouble. - What a find. - Hello? - Wow! A lot of stuff you got here. - Where did you get this substance, Wayne? - In Venice. In fact, I found it over in the canal area where that couple was murdered, why? - Mainly 'cause it's like nothing I've ever seen before. It seems to be protoplasmic, and what you've brought me is, and I'm only guessing, some kind of exoskeleton. It is organic there's no doubt about that, but it's also inorganic. - So it's not mud? - This stuff intrigues me though. I'll keep it around and make some further tests. Maybe something will surface. - Well, many thanks, Dr. John. - You just give me a day or two, and the mad doctor will come up with something. - Oh, boy. Come in. - It's locked. - Don't come in. Here don't you move till I get back. Hi, Dr. John, how are you? - Hi, Dr. John. - Hi, Jeff. - Pull up a chair. - Let's see. - So, how you doing? - Oh, I'm just fine. I'm even better after this last move here. Hmm, you're dead, Wayne. - It's compulsive she cheats all the time. If I didn't let her one once in a while, she'd never play. - Can I get you a beer or something? - Yeah, I'd love one. - Well, I take it you've come up with something and in only two days. - Uh-huh, and this is straight science fiction. - So let's hear it. - Well, first of all, that substance that you brought me was slightly radioactive. Now not dangerously so, but it does register high. - That eternal stimulus you were talking about. - Now listen to this. About 20 years ago, a nuclear reactor at the experimental test facility at Lake Sherwin, Wisconsin was discovered to be leaking an infinitesimal amount of radioactive byproduct into the lake. This instillation, by the way, is the forerunner of our modern day nuclear power plant, like the one two miles down the coast here. - What does this got to do with the mud I found? - Well, now stay with me. This is the background phase of a two-story. Along with the report on the nuclear litter was another report damn near hidden and virtually ignored. It told of the effects the spill had on a certain stagnant lagoon adjoining Sherwin. It seems that the silt in the lagoon had picked up a bit of the radioactivity and had become extremely absorptive. The bacteria, the algae, and even some of the more advanced primitive life forms living in the lagoon. - I am totally lost at this point. - Well, now you won't be. According to the two scientists that discovered this silt it had literally involved, for lack of a better word, into a form of protoplasm that took on the characteristics of whatever it absorbed and mutated into something totally different. Scientists named this organic mud, Slithis. - Why? - For the same reason your parents named you Jeff. Who knows? At any rate what should've been the discovery of the century went virtually unnoticed. Locked up tighter than a drum because of AEC's fear that notoriety over this Slithis would cause an uproar over the nuclear leak, which undoubtedly it would have. - That's a story, John. - But you ain't heard the best part yet. - There's more. - One of the scientists who originally discovered this Slithis is now working for Crest Oil Company. Apparently, the idea of using radiation to create new life stuck with him. - There's a bit of the Frankenstein in all of us. - Exactly. So he convinced the big shots at Crest to fund his experiments. He maintained that in creating instant life he was also creating the ingredients necessary for the formation of natural petroleum. - Oh, sure by combining organic matter, a little bit of bacteria, and substituting the pressure of a million years of environmental change with a dose of radioactivity. - To get to the point, it appears that substance that you brought me is something very similar to the Slithis. A freak combination of natural radioactivity and the elements that science has not be able to duplicate. - Who's the scientist that's been working for Crest? - Oh, right Erin Burrick is his name, and I believe he lives somewhere in the Malibu hills if my sources are correct. - Didn't you say that there is some other scientist? - Unfortunately, he overdosed on radiation a few years ago at the Brown Ferry nuke in Alabama. It's a hazardous line of work. Goodnight, Jeff. - Goodnight Dr. John. - Oh, and Wayne. - Hmm? - Let me know if you decide to pursue this. I sense your interest, and I feel the same way. - You'll be the first to know, and thanks. - Mm-hmm. - Deadly stuff that radioactivity. - Wayne, you were handling that dirt. - That Slithis. You heard Dr. John say it wasn't dangerous. - Well, I heard Dr. John say a lot of things, and it's all totally ridiculous. I don't understand very much of this. But just I want you to stay out of it. You've satisfied your journalist curiosity now, so leave it be. - Honey, listen. I don't understand it either. But I know there's something going on here. And if the police think this is the work of some bizarre cultist with all that mutilation business, well they're way off base. There's a big story here. It's just the spot for a freelancer to step in and make himself an overnight reputation. - You got a great job at the high school. Why can't you just be satisfied? - Because I find myself hating it more and more every day. It's okay for now. But I want more than that. This Slithis thing could be the perfect opportunity. - Okay, if you wanna mess around with radioactivity and cultists, you go right ahead and you have fun, but just don't you dare mention it around me. Move. - Hey, Bunk, man. We need some bread. - I got some bread. I got some bread. What I gotta do is take a leak. You crapped your pants? - No, I just farted. - You crapped your pants again, god dammit. - Hey, man, you're a mess. - Sure, man, I'm high, higher than these goddamn buildings, higher than the price of the wine. Preston, you snot rag. Get up. Wake up, man. Australia wasn't shit. It didn't mean nothing after Nam. All the whores were just the same. Why shouldn't they be? They were just whores. Dammit. Goddamn it. But you ain't so smart, buddy. Of course, I got more. I've got it hidden right up there. Gotcha, man! What's he doin' swimming in there? Hey, man, ain't you cold? That dude needs some wine. Hey, man. Want some wine? Buddy, you need some antifreeze. Hey, man. Hey. - In another shocking Venice mutilations, Kristen Darnel, a 32-year old stewardess, was violently murdered last night in her Rondo Court apartment. Neighbors report of hearing nothing out of the ordinary around two o'clock the time that the police experts believe the murder took place. This latest killing brings to three the total number of Venice residents murdered in the last nine days. This in addition to reports of numerous dogs and other house pets in the area slain in a similar ritualistic fashion. Even the area transients are banding together hoping for strength in numbers. The local street people, normally known to be loaners, have begun setting up a network of protected shelters in safe areas. - Sure we're scared, damn scared. Why not? Most of us ain't got no place to hide anyway, and the cops ain't gonna bust their butts trying to protect us. I sleep sometimes in the john down there by the beach. Them stalls ain't got no locks on 'em, you know. - The police in a attempt to prove their human sacrifice/death cult theory have questioned many of the various sects, unconventional social and religion groups, which abound in the Venice area. According to police spokesman Commander Philip Reed. - With the additional personal assigned to this case, we feel that we can successfully handle any threat to the Venice area. Our investigation is well underway, and we have several important clues. We are following up these leads as fast as possible. - Despite police reassurances however, Venice residents are bordering on panic. Streets are deserted, houses have become fortresses, and the smell of fear hangs like a stench over the canals. - What are you doin'? - Hi. - What are you doin' here? - Just looking around. Why? This your camp? - Yeah, that's right this is my camp. Everything's here is mine, man. - Great, look I'm sorry I thought the area was abandoned. - Well, you were wrong. - Yeah, I can see that now. You around here last night? - Why, what's it to you? - There was some trouble a few blocks down the canal. - Well, I didn't hear nothin', man, not a sound. - Look, pal. How you wanna handle your trip is up to you. But we're talking about some very nasty murders here. If you didn't see what happened, maybe whoever was with you did. Now you can talk to me or you can talk to the police. - I don't need the cops, man. I get hassled enough by the damn kids around here. They're always ripping me off. No, I wasn't alone. Another guy was over, okay? - What's his name? - It was a dude named Bunky. - Yeah. - That's it Bunky. He hangs out at the Plaza by the bike path, man. We was just juicing and shootin' the shit. I passed out. I woke up he was gone. It's okay though, man. He didn't have nothin' to do with that scene up the street. - Yeah, I'm sure of that. But it looks like you two guys are the only possible witnesses. If you were out cold, then it must have been Bunky who saw something. What does he look like? - He's about 5'6, 5'7, I guess. - How old? - About my age, 24, 25. - Okay, my name's Wayne, by the way. - Yeah, Preston, man. - Okay, Preston. Thanks. I'll be seeing you. - Hey, man. If you see Bunky, tell him he left his stuff here, man. I don't dig messes. - Say, uh. I'm looking for a friend, actually a friend of a friend, name is Bunky? - Uh-huh. What do you want with Bunky? - Personal business, to tell him he left some stuff with Preston. - Good Samaritan, huh? Well, thank you, neighbor we'll tell him about Preston, and let him know that you want to chat with him about some personal business. What's your name, man? - Look I just wanna talk to Bunky where is he? - Hey, what's it worth to you, Good Samaritan? - Oh, about a half a gallon of decent wine. - Deal. Bunky's over at Rosa's crib, Cooney's Boarding House 223 Driftwood. I don't think he's feeling too good today. So Rosa let him hang out for a while. And a bottle of wine's about five bucks worth. Inflation, you understand? - Here you are. - Thanks. Good Samaritan. Alright, man. All right. - Yeah. - Bunky? I'm a friend of Preston's. I got something he asked me to bring you. - What do you got? - Information. Can I come in? - Why not? Maybe I could use some company. - Preston, uh, asked me to tell you that you left some of your goods at his place last night. - Last night? - That's right. After he passed out and you saw whatever it was you saw. - How do you know about that, Ace? - Well, I don't, not exactly. But, you did see something. What was it? - Man, I don't know what the hell I saw. It looked like a big slimy goddamn lizard, something that crawled out of a sewer. Mouth like a sucker fish. Maybe I didn't see nothin'. I was drinking yesterday. I don't know always remember right. - Nah, Bunky, you saw something. - I saw something all right. I cut my hand when I fell and my bottle broke. This I know is real. Seven stitches at the free clinic. - Bunky, will you come with me and tell this to the police? - The cops? You snapping. Them I got no use for. Besides they wanna talk to me about a condo break in up on the Peninsula. Nah, no authorities, man, no way. If they should suddenly find me, I didn't see a damn thing 'cause I was here all night. You better split, man. - Thank you, Doctor, I certainly appreciate you taking the time. Right 8:30 will be fine. See you then. Bye. Hey, Jeff. That was our man Burrick. He sounds a little odd, but he seems friendly enough. I can meet him at his place in Malibu at 8:30. Wanna go? - Yes, I'll go. - Near the marina there is a medium-sized nuclear energy facility just a mile or so down the coast. Now it is not inconceivable that this facility may have leaked some radioactive material. Of course, the radioactivity is the catalytic ingredient that causes the abiogenesis. If you're familiar with my work, however you'll know that I've had no success in creating Slithis under laboratory conditions. - I thought... What if the Slithis had evolved beyond the point of your initial discovery? What if it evolved into a creature so complex that it sought out the nutrition necessary to keep it alive? - Evolved from the simple life form that we discovered into something more complex? I certainly wouldn't say that it wasn't possible. - But what would cause it to change? - Why the radioactivity, my dear. It has the most astounding affect on all living organisms. We found that the Slithis would incorporation the characteristics of anything it absorbed. Now given the proper nutrients, the growth potential would be endless. I have no idea what shape or form this growth would eventually take. - In other words, the form which most suited its need to survive. - The job of an imagination more fertile than my own. - Doctor, to prove any this? - You would first find the source of the radioactivity. Now if it is the nuclear energy facility, security's tight, and they'll admit to nothing. Through analysis of the soil, off the shore of the plant, however, one could accurately determine such basic elements in an investigation of this nature. - Howdy, Captain, can I help you? - Yeah, I'm looking for Chris Alexander. - Oh, my nephew. I hope there's no problems. - I just wanna charter his boat for an hour that's all. - Oh, he's on the boat in the back. You come right through this opening, you'll find him up on the top here. - Thank you. - Sure thing. - Chris. - What can I do for you? Up here. Like the spirit of the sea, eh? More often heard than seen. Again, I ask what can I do for you? - I'm Wayne Connors I'm a friend of Peter Tanakas. I need the services of a diver with a boat, and he said you might be interested. And you might give me a break on the price. It's a small job. - I might be interested. How small? - Just the few hours I need some soil samples taken off the shore of the Imperial Energy Plant. - I'll come down. So, my main man Peter is watching out for me, eh? Christopher Columbus Alexander at your service. - Glad to meet you. - Good, let's shake like you white folks. None of that tricky nigger shit. It takes too long. Now then, what did you have in mind for the dive? - Well, I don't know much about it, but it's just routine. - Routine, just in, down, and out? Are you with the Sierra Club by any chance? - Oh, no, nothing like that see I'm a journalist. I'm doing a series of articles on California's changing coastline, and I need some soil samples to back up a few theories. - It doesn't matter. As long as I'm paid, the reason for your tests make no difference. - How much will it cost me? - Well, let's see since you are a friend of my man Peter and I'm working for my uncle on an account, how does 30 plus fuel sound? - That sounds fair. - It is. Tomorrow is my day of freedom. Meet me at the ocean side dock, number 22, at 10:00 and you can buy a few hours of my life. - You know I don't know how to take you. - Be cool and maybe we'll learn about one another together. - How fast can this mini tug roll, Chris? - Oh, about six knots. This boat wasn't built for comfort or speed. Reliability is the watch word on the Creation. - Suits your needs, huh? - There you go. It totes my gear and holds the fish I catch, and the payments are right, I own it. The only possession my family ever owned. - I appreciate your helping me. I wish I could tell you more, but I don't know anymore. - And what do I need to know? You want some soil and water samples. You're paying for the fuel. I'm just along for the dive. - Go in as far as you have to. Closer to the shore the better. - I can go all the way to the power plant if you want. - Well, maybe halfway. - You've got lots of tubes there. I'll just bring you samples from three or four areas. You won't need too many because the floor hits its deepest point pretty quick. Then levels for a long way out. - Alright, good you bring 'em up and I'll mark 'em. Alright, this should do it. - I'm waterlogged to the bone. Man it is dark down there. - You didn't see anything out of the ordinary down there did you? - Nah, not even any fish, which are odd because they usually like the warm waters off these power plants. - Oh. - Yeah. Well, at least I found a spot not to go fishing. Let me dry off and we'll head for home. - You sure, I only dropped the stuff off this morning is why I'm asking. Okay, it's fine with me. Well, what about the water? Right. Great I'll be by to see you then tomorrow. Yeah, bye. - Well? - Yes and no. There was Slithis in the water samples from about 20 yards out. Not exactly like the first droppings I gave him but similar. None of the water samples showed any radioactivity though. - Is that what you expected? - I would've confirmed a current leak. See the Slithis means that there was a leak sometime. Impossible to determine when though according to Dr. John. - Wayne, I just can't imagine how you're gonna convince anybody that there's a slime creature feasting on the residents of Venice. I love you very, very much, and I don't believe a word of it. - Well, just wait till I suggest the idea to the police tomorrow morning. - So, you weren't too surprised when the police didn't think much of your theory, huh? - Yeah, but I had to give it a shot. The aggregation was that Lieutenant Prentiss. Says he's in charge of a 120 men. He shouldn't be in charge of pencils. - Well, so the cops aren't interested. What's your next step? - Well, I got an idea. Apparently, the creature moves on land, but primarily it's a water animal, right? So, what if we cut off the only access to the canals? - In theory, no more Venice murders. - Right, the damn thing would go on out looking for more food and hopefully go right on out to sea. - So how do you plan to close off the canal? - Well, the water level of the canals is determined by the tides. High tide lots of water, low tide and the canals are dry. So we wait for low tide, and then close off the water lock at the mouth of the grand canal. Deprived of that root, the creature can't get to the upper canals. - Somebody's gonna raise holy hell when they notice that the water isn't coming back in with the tide. Now wait a minute what do you mean we close off the water lock? You know this is probably illegal. - Yeah, this is gonna be tougher than I thought. It's two locks and a lot of fence. A key where did you get a key? - An old college friend of mine is a resident oceanologist here. All it takes is a phone call. - Okay, with any luck at all no one will notice this until tomorrow, and we'll see what happens tonight. - Three, two, one. - You got a race. Changing direction. Reason to get a $50 turtle there. Gary's gonna bring out a no-time winner by names of Legs Magert. That's has an almost racing win of zip. - Five, four, three, two, one. - The gate is up!, man, look! Many of them fishing out the gate. Look at this! The Magician's going to the line! The Magician in a total finish for the event! The Magician wraps it up, racing! These are the monsters. These are the ones you gotta watch out for. They've been known to attack spectators. For the beginner's racing Sheryl's gonna bring out Moe. - Come on let's get out of here. - It's a maiden entry. The winner! The winner in a time of 22 seconds flat, Richards, Richards breeding. - That place was like a zoo tonight. A lot crazier than usual. - I know I've never seen anything like it. - So now I'm gonna show you something else you've never seen before. The Marina del Rey from the rear deck of my boat. - Sounds like fun. - Who was the girl you were with tonight? - Oh, that's my cousin. That's who I'm staying with while I'm out here. - Yeah, you said you were visiting from, uh? - Souska, North Dakota, population 611. - Alright, the big time, huh? You know I saw you get checked three times tonight, so, I guess, you're old enough to party. But you do look younger. - Oh, would it make a difference if I were? - Not really, depending on how much though. - Oh, back home everyone has ID. I'm only 18, but I don't act like it, do I? - No, absolutely not. You come across much older, at least 20, and I'm an instant dirty old man. So what do you do in Souska, North Dakota? What does anybody do in Souska, North Dakota? - Well, practically everyone leaves. That's what I'm about to do. That's why I'm out here now. I'm just getting things together. 'Cause back home the only work is in the ball bearing factories. Souska's famous for its ball bearings. - I can't believe it. - Well, it's true Souska's a factory town. - And so what are you gonna do out here? - I don't know I really don't care. It's just different, it's exciting. - And it's not Souska, right? - Right. - Yeah, right. - So how long have you lived on a boat? - Oh, a couple of years now. But I'm getting the old bug again, and I'll be doing some more travelling pretty soon. - My cousin and I were in Hawaii last summer. - Hmm. You know you are really nice looking with such a nice tight body. - Well, I played a lot in school, you know sports and things. - Yeah, that too. Hey, listen I gotta go to the john, so why don't you go on out onto the boat. Maybe pour us a little wine, huh? - Alright, well, which one is it? - Big cruiser, see end of the dock. The light are on and the cabin door should be open. - Okay. - Okay. - Oh, hey, I'm sorry. I thought it was Doug. I was waiting, and I heard his car. I'm really sorry. - It's alright you just scared me. - My name is Rex I live in the building next door. - Hi, I'm Jennifer. - Okay. - Great a party, huh? What's all the commotion? - Huh, nothing much I was waiting for you and watching a little TV down below, and I kind of caught Jennifer here off guard. - Yeah, well I'll bet. Just leaving though weren't you, Rex? - Yeah, I guess I was. Nice meeting you Jennifer, and again I apologize for the shock, bye. - It's all right it was nice meeting you. - Rex is a good guy, but he hangs around a lot. Just a frustrated boat owner, I guess. Let's go below. - Okay. It's a nice place to live. - Yeah, I try to make it as comfortable as possible. And I am sorry about Rex. I mean, I was surprised as you must have been. - Well, you know good fences make good neighbors or at least that's the way Robert Frost felt about it. - And he was right at least where Rex is concerned. How about that wine? - Hmm, that'd be great. - Okay. Hit the music, okay? - Okay. Thank you. - Red wine from chilled glasses, and with a flick of the switch, instant atmosphere. To us. What time is your curfew? - Why would you ask that? - I was just wondering. - Yeah, I'll bet. Oh, yeah. - You're tense? - Cold. - Yeah, give me this. Turn around. Turn around. Your tense up here. And here can you feel this? - Oh, yeah, I can. - And down in here? - Yes. - Come on let's go below. - No, I shouldn't. - Come on, come on. - Hey, what was that? - That's nothing. I'm moored at the end of the dock and I catch the wave from every passing boat that all. - Well, you know you left the cabin door open. I wish you'd lock it. I know it's silly but with your friend hanging around-- - Hey, listen, listen, listen. If it'll make you comfortable, I'll do it all right. I mean, I like my privacy too. Why don't you get naked while I'm gone, alright? - Okay. - Doug? Doug? Doug? - Look I said no comment and I mean no comments! Come in. Well? - Lieutenant, there's some guy named Connors here to see you. - Oh, yes, I know Connors, Brown, bring him in. - Connors. - Well, very good, Brown. Hold all calls. - Good evening, Lieutenant. - No, no it isn't. It is an insidious evening following a disastrous morning. I suppose you've heard the latest? - Mm-hmm, two more. This time in the marina. That's why I'm here. - I assume that had something to do with your visit. - I know you don't think very much of my theory, Lieutenant. But this time I've got evidence that's a bit more substantial. - Well, get on with it, Connors. - Last night's murders took place in the marina because I shut off the creature's access to the canals. Yesterday afternoon I closed the lock at the marina jetty. - It's against the law to tamper with those locks. You should've been arrested. - But I wasn't. Look I'm trying to help you people stop this horrible business. I've been doing the work your police officers haven't been because they've been too busy trying to prove this ridiculous mutilation cult garbage! - Alright, Connors. It's obvious that you are trying to help us. And if I were not dissatisfied with this mutilation theory myself, you would not be sitting in my office at this time. But, I do not believe one word of your slither story! - Slithis. - Oh, pardon me, Slithis story. But, what I saw this afternoon it was a blood bath. In the interest of public safety, I am willing to consider everything. Therefore, I will have one of my police scientists talk even with you. Sergeant, ask Risling to come in for a moment. - So then this incredibly adaptable mutation has involved into a humanoid creature. But Mr. Connors why is it murdering people? - Not murdering. It's feeding on them. See it attacks and eats whatever's around. Look, when I sampled the mud off the shore of the power plant, my diver said he saw no sea life at all, no fish, nothing. It's stands to reason that the creature has eatin' himself out of his spawning grounds, and he's moved on looking for food. Now it hit a good area in the canals, fish, dogs, people, so it returned. Yesterday afternoon I cut off the creature's access to the canals and it moved on down the channel and onto one of the boats. Now maybe if there had been water in the canal when we closed it off, the creature would've gone over the embankment and across the road I don't know. I don't believe we're dealing with anything that's ever existed before, so there's no way of predicting what it's going to do. - Well, I'm not going to question the possibility of Slithis because organic mud may well exist. Although, it borders on a abiogenesis, which was disproven by Louis Pasteur back in the 1800, but that's neither here nor there. What I can't accept is the idea that this thing has been living off the coast all this time and no one's noticed it. - Risling. The point is moot. I have just finished chatting with the plant manager at the Imperial Nuclear Energy station, and he assures me that his facility has not had any radioactive leak of any kind since this plant was constructed in 1965! - Of course, he did I told you he would. Did you expect him to admit something like that! - Unless Risling feels that some further conversation would be of a productive nature, I believe we will close this subject. Risling? Very well. Mr. Connors, again I am going to thank you for your display of public spirit. But I'm very busy, and my department is very busy! Risling will escort you out for the last time! - Brother that is one crazy story, but who knows. - Stranger things have come to pass, like the existence of Slithis itself. - Well, actually two of my people fishing off the coast of Jamaica netted an ill-like creature that the expert thought extinct for centuries. In the sea all things are possible. - Oh, really. - But not probable. I won't be the loan dissenter here. Whatever you guys decide is fine with me. - I never thought I'd hear it. - Yes, I never thought I'd say it. - Tell me something. If this Slithis does retain the traits you say, why won't it return to its spawning beds? - You mean the area we found the samples? - Right. - John? - Hey. While I am thinking of it. If there is a creature down there, you might have gotten me eatin'. - It was a chance I had to take. - White boy, please. - Hey, Chris, have you got a small sonar tracker? - I think I can get one. A friend of mine will loan it to me. - I like it. All we do is wait out there until we detect the creature, and then follow it in. - And if the thing exists, that'll spot it alright? - Yeah, but what then? I mean, assuming that you spot it. - We catch the bad ass mother. I've got netting that'll hold a great white. I guarantee it won't get away, and I know a couple of guys that would love to join to us on a monster hunt. - Okay. - Okay. Hell with the police. Dr. John, you and Jeff you wait by the canal entrance. When we pick up the creature and see he's headed towards the canals, you close off the lock. - How are we gonna know? - Yeah, there's a couple of radios I can get at school. I think I can get them out with no problem. They're good for up to a mile or so. - And then when we close off the canal, you guys follow the big boy wherever his appetite leads him. - Right, send in the hue and cry as we go! - Oh, no, if this thing is real, we ain't going to say anything to anyone until it's caught, and I'm going to catch it. - All right. - Sun's going down quick. It should be a clear night. - But in case it's not, I have Mike and Nicolas to hook up the generator and the night lights. The sonar is working okay, and I borrowed this spotlight in case we need it. It's one powerful mother. - I hope this radio is gonna be all right. It worked out fine at school. - And I brought this too. - Yeah, I noticed. I don't know if that's gonna be of any use though. Remember the Dunns unloaded a whole pistol into that creature and nothing happened. - This ain't a pistol, my man. Think we'll be here all night? - I don't know. Since it's never been spotted during the day, I guess it does all its forging after dark. Maybe it's irritated by the boat traffic, and waits until it dies down. I don't know what senses this thing has, so I don't know how it reacts to its environment. - It's got an appetite. That's its downfall. Give Mike and Nicolas a hand with the nets, will ya? - Yeah, okay. What time is it? Oh, about 1:30. - Time isn't going by slow, it stopped. - It feels that way. Wayne! - What? - It's real it's over there about 20 feet off the barge. Okay, okay. Now when it really starts moving, let it get enough head, so the engines don't spook it. - I just hope we can keep up with it. This is it. Wake up on deck. We got something. - Right back towards the marina. Now don't lose it. - Don't worry I couldn't lose junior here even if I tried. According to the sonar this thing is sized large. - Straight for the canal entrance. Hello, Jeff, hello, Jeff. - Hi, honey, we're about to fall asleep. - Well, wake up because we're on our way. The creature is heading right for the opening. Tell John to close off the lock. - What there really is something? - We're following it now get John moving! - Dr. John, Dr. John wake up. - Huh, what is it? - They're headed this way. They're tracking the thing towards us. Wayne says to close the lock. - Okay. - Wayne, John's got it sealed. - Good, now stay awake and keep your eyes open. I don't know what you should expect. - We see what we shall see. - Jeff, Chris says we're in about as far as we can go. The creature's getting close to you, but it's difficult to say just how close because of the rocks. - We're watching. Wayne, I hear something. - What's going on? - Maybe I can see something. - Okay, it must be heading for the boats. I should pick it up on the tracker pretty quick. - Get the car quick! Get in the car! - Wayne! Wayne, it's coming! Wayne! - the transmission's locked down inside the car! - Wayne! Wayne! - Jeff! - Get out of the car! - Dr. John! Dr. John! Oh, Dr. John, are you alright? - I'm okay. I'm okay. - Wayne, Wayne we're all right. Dr. John's not hurt. Wait the monster's not following him. I think it's dead! - No, it's alive we got it on the scanner again. It's headed for the harbor. I think the thing was trying for the canal when it ran into you. - We gotta move. Nicolas, keep your eyes open. - Jeff, we're gonna follow it. Head it off before he reaches the boats. Now you and John wait for us at Chris's slip. - Wayne, be careful, I love you. - The things making a crazy move, but it doesn't seem to be injured. - The son of a bitch probably can't feel pain. You know if it gets in the docking area under the boats we've lost it. - I've got that covered. We're gonna get it to chase after us for a while. - How? - I've got 30 gallons of chum in the tank. If the big boy is hungry, I'll give him all he can handle. Remember, brother, this thing is just a fish. I'm one hell of a fisherman. Take over the helm. Here, pour this fragrant garbage over the port while I reverse our direction. Dinner is served you big bastard. Fish head soup. Okay, you ready to put the hook to the slimy beast. - I guess, what's the plan? - We're gonna net it, drag it off to sea, wear it down and pull it in. - Pull it in, we just saw that son of a bitch demolish a car and you're gonna pull it in? How about calling the Coast Guard? - No way, this thing belongs to us. Besides if this creature is shy of boats like you say, an open call to the Coast Guard is gonna bring out every boat in the harbor. The thing will then head right out to sea. - You sure about the nets? - Hey, man, strongest still. - Let's do it. - Okay, I'll slow her down. Nicolas. Move forward and keep watch. Now dump what you've got left. Right next to the side. When we spot it below surface, we toss the net. Oh, shit. - What happened? - I don't know, but I don't wanna be sitting without power when that thing finishes the chum. Mike, take the helm. Let's go below. Dammit. Engine's overheated. Bring me a bucket of water. I can't wet it now. If I crack the block, that's it. - What caused it to overheat? - I don't know maybe the water pump. I can fix it but not until it cools down. Close the door the guys on deck don't have to know what's happening here. - I don't see a damn thing out here. Mike, turn on the big lamp, will you? - Oh, hell, this thing isn't working. I'm gonna have to find a flashlight. - Take your time. Not much happening out here. - Oh, Mike! - Look out! Use the shotgun. Wayne, the net we can snare him. Whoa! Wayne! Wayne! - He's dead now. - Then let's get rid of the nasty son of a bitch over the side. - No! We gotta take it back. Proof. - Of what? Mike, Nicolas gone. The two of us damn near dead. That's garbage there. Wayne smell it, man. It came from the sea now it's dead. Send it back! It's better, man. That thing doesn't belong with us, with anyone. - Yeah, okay. Yeah, what the hell.
