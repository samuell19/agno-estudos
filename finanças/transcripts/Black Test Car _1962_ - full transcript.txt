A DAIEI CO. LTD. PRODUCTION Shall we begin the speed test, then? There are no cars tailing us. No sign of anyone ahead of us, either. Tadokoro, the road seems clear of spies. Let's begin. Roger that. We will now begin the speed test for the Pioneer test car number one. - Alright? - Proceed. That's it! BLACK TEST CAR ORIGINAL STORY BY TOSHIYUKI KAJIYAMA SCREENPLAY BY KAZUO FUNABASHI & YOSHIHIRO ISHIMATSU CINEMATOGRAPHY BY YOSHIHISA NAKAGAWA MUSIC BY SEI IKENO CAST: JIRO TAMIYA, JUNKO KANO, EIJI FUNAKOSHI HIDEO TAKAMATSU, BONTARO MIAKE, YOSUKE TAKEMURA ICHIRO SUGAI, KICHIJIRO UEDA, TOSHIKO HASEGAWA TATSUO HANABU, KENJI OYAMA, KOICHI ITO, EIICHI TAKAMURA SABURO SAKAI, TAKASHI NAKAMURA, JUN OSANAI, YUJI MORIYA REIKO HIBIKI, ICHIRO AMINAKA, WAKAYO MATSUMURA, GEN HARADA DIRECTED BY YASUZO MASUMURA TIGER TEST CAR BURNS TIGER TEST CAR FAILED: WAS ACCIDENT DUE TO TECHNICAL ERROR? Onoda, how did this accident happen? There was too much momentum when the car took the curve. So you're saying it was a driving error? The engine's enhancements created an unpredictable acceleration. Nothing's wrong with the car, then? The press has it wrong. The car's technically perfect. It's a shame to have a failure exposed like this. Apologies, sir. It was our fault for not seeing the spies. Clear this away. There's nothing we can do about that now. The question is, do we go into production or not? As the sales manager, I'm against it. Will a sports car sell in Japan? There's a great demand for them, according to marketing surveys. The family car is the most in demand. Sports cars come second. All automobile companies make family cars. Wouldn't it more exciting to be the first to produce a sports car? It's too risky. People want speed and luxury in a car. Sports cars can deliver both. The Pioneer's your dream. Yes, I love it, but in a sensible way. It's not a sporty coup√©, but a practical sedan. Your opinion, Chief of Production? Technicians would agree with Mr. Onoda. How about going to the hospital and consulting with the President? Never mind that. Prepare to go into production. I'll report to the President. One last thought... Only the President, the board of directors and all of us here know that the Pioneer is a sports car, so let's keep that a secret. DO NOT ENTER FOR DEPARTMENT MEMBERS ONLY It's me. Matoba? Come in. We've been waiting for you. Excuse me. Any news? - I'll say. - As always. Let's hear it. - It'll cost you. - I know. It always does. Your rival exposed you to the papers. - The Yamato Motor Company? - That's right. Mawatari's spies were at the test site. - Who's Mawatari? - A director and the Head of Planning. A former army officer. A colonel and a secret agent in the former Imperial Army in Guangdong. What a treacherous thing to do! Should we suspend production on the car? Nonsense! He can't make us give up. Make sure your paper says our new Tiger model will be outstanding. Certainly. We'll make you rivals in the trade papers. The payroll department will take care of you. Thank you very much. Give it your best, everyone, and win this fight against Mawatari. Excuse me. He's right. That's why I set up a new department and transferred all of you here. To keep the Pioneer a secret and to spy on our rivals. Yes, we're industrial spies. We can't let our competitors beat us. It's strange, though. Only thirty men knew about the test date and testing grounds. - So how did Mawatari find out? - Simple. There's a spy. A spy? Among the staff? Asahina, have thirty data sheets printed and give them to those who knew about the test date. The Pioneer specs? We're going to change the data so it'll look like an ordinary car. Then? After some time, we ask for the sheets back. If someone doesn't return a sheet, he's the spy. Interesting. Listen, the Pioneer is my life. It's been my dream for years. Look, it's like a Michelangelo design in its elegance and beauty. I couldn't bear it if Mawatari stole the design. We can't let that happen! - Welcome. - Hello, Madame. - I haven't seen you in ages. - Two highballs, please. - Who's this? - One of my co-workers. - You look beautiful, as always. - Suave, aren't you? - I'd forgotten, since you hardly ever come. - Does your patron come every night? - Sorry, I don't have one. - How about Mr. Mawatari? That old man? Don't make me sick! Listen, will you be my patron? Don't be silly. With my salary, I couldn't afford you. Oh, I guess you're not suave enough for me, then. Good evening, Mr. Mawatari. Well, this is unusual. So what brings you here? - You sure put one over on me this time. - What do you mean? I mean this. Oh, that. Reporters are like parasites. They print lies, then demand money to retract them. And men who hire parasites to write lies are even worse! Ah, that's pretty harsh. Still, whoever's controlling these reporters is still in the dark about our new car. Are you sure? You'd better be extra careful. True, since I'm up against a professional military spy. No, I fear amateurs more. They'll stop at nothing. So do you want to bet whether you'll find out our secrets or if I can keep them from you? Welcome. Let's drop all this shop talk and have a drink, eh? It seems fine. Let's go with what you suggest. It'll be decided at the board of directors' meeting. You know, Oguri, our company, Tiger, is still a second-rate company. I hope we can become big enough to overtake competitors like Yamato. We can, if the Pioneer sells, sir. Do your best. If you succeed, I can retire and you can become President. Take care, sir. Did you call, sir? The pain's returned. I need an injection. Very well, sir. I'll be right there. Hiraki, how's my daughter? - Are you two getting along? - Yes, sir. And my grandchildren? Have you found a good school for the eldest? Yes, but the entrance exam is very difficult. Don't worry, he's clever like you. - Bring them along next time you come. - OK. Hey! Welcome home. - Come in. - It's rather late... Never mind that. Come in. Whiskey. Please come in. I have a high opinion of you, Asahina. If we succeed, I intend to make you department head. Work hard for me. - Sorry to bother you so late. - Not at all, I'm used to it. He never stops working, even at home! He gets home at two or three in the morning and never sees the children! Don't complain. Work is a primary concern for men! When you get married, Mr. Asahina, cherish your family. Don't model yourself after him. He's my successor. He'll take after me. Right? So, you came... You never come to the bar, so I decided to come here. I've been busy at work. I waited for you after we closed, and one of the lecherous customers loitered, too. Get me some water. I hate being a bar hostess. Nothing but vulgar men and low pay. Why not quit? Easy for you to say. How would I afford to eat? - How about you marry me? - Don't joke when you're drunk. I'm serious. After this job's finished, let's get married. - Really? - On one condition, though. What? - Work at the Pandora until we marry. - Why? There's a regular customer named Mawatari. I want you to pay attention to who he meets and what he talks about with them. - So I'm supposed to be a spy? - Frankly, yes. - And if I don't, you won't marry me? - Maybe not. I see. Then, I refuse. Why? You don't want to marry me? Not with conditions. I'm happy with things as they are, seeing each other when we feel like it. But this is for my career. Help me out. You'd marry for the sake of your career? If my plan works, I'll be department head and then we can get married. Your company's pretty conservative, how would they feel about a department head's wife having been a bar hostess? We'll take a Pioneer and have our honeymoon in Hokkaido. - What's a Pioneer? - It's a secret for now. So, please... go and work at the Pandora Club. Sorry to keep you waiting. - Am I disturbing you? - Not a bit. - Would you like a different girl? - Not at all. - You're a new girl, aren't you? - This is my first night. - What's your name? - I'm Masako. Pleased to meet you. Do you like her? - She's a lucky find. - She's just your type. Do enjoy yourself. You look like someone dear to me. - I see. Was she your first love? - No. - Your wife when she was young? - No, my daughter. Well, that's a new line. - She'd be about the same age as you. - Really? She and my wife both died in Manchuria during the war. I'm sorry to hear that. What a lovely hand! - Who bought you this ring? - This cheap thing? I bought it myself. Would you like me to buy you a more dazzling one? Really? Come to my hotel, and I'll show you my collection. A collection of jewels? I cherish them as a substitute for my family. You can pick whichever one you like. But there'd be a price to pay later, I bet. Perhaps. - Stop it. The Madame is watching. - Forget her. But you're her patron, aren't you? No thanks. You're wrong. There's nothing between us. Good evening. Shimamoto... You're a faithful customer. Do you come here every night? For the same reason you do. What reason would that be? Madame enchants me, too. Well, you're mistaken. This girl's my reason. It was exactly like this? Yeah. Excellent. With this, we can find the spy at our company. Thanks to you. - Do you know a guy called Shimamoto? - I know him. He's Executive Secretary. He was drinking with Mr. Mawatari. What did they talk about? Just small talk about women. I see. Keep an eye on Mawatari for me. Mawatari invited me up to his hotel room to pick out a jewel from his collection. Then why don't you go? He'd be off guard. You might be able to get some important papers. I hate all this spying. It's all deception and thieving. It's for my company and for me. - Why kiss me? - Because I love you. Mr. Shimamoto? Just going to Pandora isn't conclusive proof. And he's the director's nephew. - That's strange. - What's strange? There are thirty-five copies returned. I checked. - How many went out? - Thirty-five copies, sir. Every single copy came back. - How many did you print? - Only thirty-five, sir. Not a single extra copy. I stayed there for the entire printing run and I destroyed the template. So which one did Mawatari see? He saw one of these, then he returned it to the spy. Should I investigate all thirty-five employees, sir? You mean shadow them like the police? That'd be impossible. It was such a good idea, but it failed. - It wasn't a wasted effort. - Why not? From the false data, Mawatari will think that the Pioneer is a family car. So? So let's go a little further. Let's make sure he believes that. How? Your guest is here, sir. - So you want to sell the Tiger design? - That's right. - Your name? - I'm Yamada. - You're a Tiger employee? - I'm in the design department. Why sell it to me? You'll be fired if you're found out. I need the money. What for? I'm sick of being a salaryman. I want to strike out on my own. I see. How much do you need to start up? One million. That's not so much, is it? Not if this is the real thing. Let's see it. For one million yen. This is the design for the Pioneer. - Engine capacity? - 1,200cc. - Maximum speed? - 80mph. Wheel base and height? Look at the plan. - I want the specs on the Pioneer. - Just look at the design. - This is for a family car. - The Pioneer is a family car. - Is it? - Absolutely. You can't fool me like that... Mr. Asahina. The Pioneer's a sports car. Go back and tell your boss, Mr. Onoda, that I know everything. You've got guts to come and try to fool me, but it was childish of you. Here's expenses for your trouble. So he already knew? I guess I lost that bet. Sorry, sir. We weren't shrewd enough. You men haven't failed. It's that damn spy, an executive who's sold out our firm. An executive? Who knows the Pioneer's a sports car? The President, Mr. Oguri, and four directors. The production and sales managers. - And? - Four department heads. Shimamoto, and Chief Engineer Tadokoro. That makes fourteen. And one's a spy. But they wouldn't do that! Who knows? Many of them would be glad to see Oguri and me fall on our faces. Now they're all enemies. That's what it's like to be in a company. It's probably Matoba. He called to say he'd be here. It's me. You all look so glum. Hurry up and give us the news. I've got eye-popping news for you. I'll give you a bonus. Now what is it? Yamato's building a new model. - A new model? - Yes. What kind? Luxury or family car? I don't know the details. Anyway, they're definitely making a new model. And they're testing it pretty soon. Your spying fee. Thanks a lot. It's hard milking information out of Yamato. You know what Mawatari's like. We can't keep secrets with a spy among our executives. We have to do everything we can to uncover their new model. The best defense is a good offense. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. JAPAN AUTOWORKERS' UNION HQ This is about the Yamato production data. That's a lot of classified material. Ours, too? That's right. We can't win in a collective bargaining. The production schedule for Yamato's new car, machines, workers, workload, all laid out for easy reference. - Any use? - Absolutely. Much appreciated. I hate betraying Yamato... but I'm a Tiger employee. The design of the new Yamato car? It's very difficult to get anything on that. Yamato's taking no chances. But can't you get in by pretending to check the photocopiers? I do that sometimes. Their designs are in the vault, and they shred the rejects. Even the shredded paper would do. You haven't bought any of our machines. Will you buy a few? I'll ask my company. Take this, for now. No turning back now. Let's do it. I have a grudge against the Yamato design department. - The chief is a greedy man. - Greedy? He pressured us about the machines. - A kickback? - Yes, he asked for one. I was mad, but I wanted the contract, so... A blueprint of Yamato's components? No, I can't. I won't make any trouble for you. I just want to take a copy. I'm sorry, I just can't. Who's more important, us or Yamato? We've ordered components from you from the beginning. You've only recently started business with Yamato. Yes, that's true, but I'll get in trouble. If you won't help us, our director said he would have to reconsider our contracts with you. What do you mean? He'll look for another subcontractor. That's cruel. So let us have it. Yamato won't know. There's not enough data to give us a conclusive idea of Yamato's new model. But it looks very much like our Pioneer. Meaning? The engine is 1,800 or 1,900cc. Four cylinders. Maximum speed is between 95mph and 110mph. - So it could be a sports car? - It could be. And the style? I've no idea at all. I see... Thank you. Asahina... you say an executive at Yamato took a kickback from a printer? His name's Mori, I believe. Our backs are against the wall. Let's put the screws on him. His kickback bought this house and land? This must've cost at least four million, and he's still in debt. He's coming out. - Bye, Daddy. - Bye-bye. Are you Mr. Mori, Chief of Design for the Yamato Motor Company? That's right. We have an important business matter to discuss with you. It won't take long. Please... What's this all about? I work for Tiger Motors. What do you want with me? We'd like to make a deal with you. - A deal? - I'd like to see your design. What design? The design for the new model. We'd like to see the type, the driving data and the styling. - You want me to reveal our trade secrets? - Yes. I refuse. I've worked for Yamato for 20 years. How could I betray my company? We don't want to see it for free. We'll pay you 1.5 million. - How about it? - I don't want it. Let me go. I have to get to work. I'll report you to the police. Go ahead. We have something to report, too. - What? - That you accepted a kickback. - That's not true. - No use denying it. You took 500,000 yen when you bought the printing presses. We've done our research. Mr. Mori, if you don't give us the specs, we'll inform the Yamato executives about you. I'll repay the 500,000 yen. You think that'll solve everything? Yamato's a reputable company. You'd be fired. That would be a pity. You'd have to sell the house and live in a cheap apartment again. Looking for work at your age would be hard. It would be really hard on your family, too. If you give us the designs, you can still work and get out of debt, too. You'll be the winner all the way. That's all we needed to discuss with you. Get in. We'll take you to your office. Think it over and give us your answer by the time we get there. - He's here. - I guess he finally agreed. Here are the designs. Thanks. Please take this cheque. Yes, Mr. Onoda, I took a kickback, but you're even worse. As a manager, you intimidate and blackmail people. You're nothing more than a gangster! Have you no shame? Call me anything you want, if it makes you feel better. You're the lowest of the low. I never want to see you again! Blackmailing someone is a horrible thing to do. He brought it on himself. Besides, he's blaming the wrong party. Yamato's new car is called the Mypet. - Asahina. - What's wrong? Look. They screwed us again. It's exactly like the Pioneer. They stole our entire design. It's like having a lover kidnapped. Now I really want to kill Mawatari! Why did you let Yamato steal what cost us $50,000 to develop? Onoda, what's your department doing? - They're not to blame. - Why not? - We have a Yamato spy among us. - A spy? And he's among the seven of us here. Among us? They're the company brains. There's no way we can keep secrets with a spy here. Onoda, what proof do you have? The original design is in this locker. Only we seven know how to open this locker. Aren't there copies at the factory? I handle the factory copies, and they've never been stolen. - Unless you're the spy. - Manager! Gentlemen, is there really a spy here? Enough of your jokes! Mr. Kurokawa and I have struggled for the company since it was founded. We wouldn't turn into spies. - Right, Kurokawa? - Right. Hiraki, what about you? My father-in-law founded this company. I wouldn't betray it. And you, Shimamoto? I'm a timid man by nature. I'd be too afraid to spy. - Are you sure, Onoda? - Yes, sir. But I don't intend to question or shadow each one of you. - Of course not. - So what do we do? There's nothing more to steal, spy or no spy. Please start the production on our car. Start production? That's a big risk. Why's that? Between ourselves and Yamato, we almost have the same car. - There's no way we can compete with them. - Why not? Why not? The differences between Tiger and Yamato are too great. We're behind them in production, publicity and sales power. - We can't win. - We can win. Cut the crap! - Through pricing. - Pricing? If the two cars are the same, consumers will buy the cheaper one. We'll make ours 50,000 to 100,000 yen cheaper. But how will you know their price? We'll find out, but they'll never find out ours... even if there is a spy here. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. Very well. You got hold of the Mypet design. I'll trust you and start production. - Where are you taking me? - You'll see. Go on in. - Go in? - This is the bathroom. Just go right in. Come on, go right in. Here, use these and look at that building over there. What do you see? This is great! The Yamato conference room. What's the meeting for? Is it for price-setting? Let me see. What do you think? Quite a view, isn't it? Is there no way to hide a mike in there? That's impossible. How about planting a wireless microphone in that vase? Yamato employees are veteran army agents. They'd find it in no time. Sorry it isn't of any use. I'll see you later. Hey... I've got a good idea. Let's talk it over with Mr. Onoda. The Pioneer's going on sale soon. When's the price going to be decided? We have a set of different prices, between a million and 1.2 million yen, We have eleven different sets of poster ads for the newspapers. What's the point of that? We won't reveal the price until the very last minute. DOCTOR'S PRIVATE OFFICE Where's the President's room? That's the nurse's room. Let's ask her. When we know their price, we'll undersell by 60,000 to 80,000 yen. Choosing from the eleven prices, we'll inform the parties concerned and then we'll discard the rest... Who are you? I'm the head nurse of this ward. Who told you to do this? Answer me, or we'll report you. Bugging someone is a crime. Selling a company's secrets is breach of trust. An employee from your company told me to do this. - Who? - Mr. Shimamoto. Shimamoto? Come with us. - Which one? - The one that's napping. He said he was Executive Secretary. So he's the one? The fool! Most likely he wanted money for a woman! Right, I'll deal with him. - Please don't, sir. - Why? No one betrays our company, not even my nephew. But it'll be a blot on your record, too, sir. It'll affect our stand on production. That's true, but... It's lucky we found out. How about we keep it to ourselves and transfer him out? A reshuffling of personnel. But... - I have some better news. - What is it? Asahina thought of it. It can't go wrong. There's a way of knowing Yamato's price. Oh? How? MEETING IN PROGRESS Mr. Onoda, did you get the results from the questionnaires regarding the correct pricing of the Pioneer? Yes, I sent them to Department Three. - So what's the price? - 1.15 million yen according to IBM, sir. And what is the cost? The cost is about 940,000 yen, sir. Will we make enough profit? Yes, sir... even after allowing for PR and salesmen margins. I see. How about a price of 1.15 million yen? Well, it's reasonable, but do we know Yamato's price? They'll be holding a pricing conference tomorrow. So we can't set our final price until then. Please don't worry, sir. We'll find out theirs in time. What if the Mypet is under 1.15 million yen? Then we'll meet again and set a cheaper price. As for now, the Pioneer's price is 1.15 million yen. - You have no worries about spies? - That problem is solved. Don't worry, sir. CLOSED FOR REPAIRS PLEASE USE 5TH FLOOR BATHROOMS I think the meeting's about to start. The President has finished talking. It's Mawatari's turn. - High speed? - It's all set. - Focus on his mouth. - Leave it to me. Start. "Today... "let's determine... the Mypet's price. "I asked you all here... to this meeting "in order to determine the price." - That's it. - I see. This was a great idea, Onoda. - It was Asahina's idea. - Oh? What a show! "But a few words before we decide. "The Tiger Corporation... "set the price of their Pioneer model... "at 1.15 million yen yesterday." How did they get wind of that, Onoda? - Unfortunately, I don't know, sir. - Stay on your toes! We're stealing their secrets, too. Please don't worry, sir. We'll know their price soon. "So the price of the Mypet is... "one million yen... "One million yen..." - I can't make it out. - Rewind this part. "So the price of the Mypet... "is one million yen... "One million yen plus X amount. "The President will decide this X amount. "The X amount won't be made public until the night before the car goes on sale. "This is done as a precaution against spies. Ha-ha... "This concludes our meeting." That's all. Do you know the price now? - Sorry, sir... - Apologies won't help. I trusted you. They steal our data, and we're helpless. Is your department a hobby for you? It's been utterly useless. I can't believe how ridiculous this is. We're finished. I'm sorry we weren't any help, sir. No, you were all a great help. Do me a favor, Asahina. Talk to Masako. Masako? About what? We'll do it outside. - Thank you very much, madam. - Not at all. We haven't dated in a long time. What do you want? I want you to go to Mawatari's hotel. What for? There's a white envelope in Mawatari's briefcase. It'll contain the price of Yamato's new model. Find it. I can't. The old man's really cautious. You've got to catch him off-guard. How? Stay at the hotel. Sleep with Mawatari. Do you know what you're asking? I do. Aren't you ashamed of asking your own girlfriend to do this? How can you pimp me out like a prostitute? - I can. - Why? It's for the good of the company... and for Mr. Onoda. So your company is more important than me? How appalling! I won't do it. You don't understand. We've been cornered. Only you can save us. Only you can get to Mawatari. I'm begging you. All right, if you're so desperate, I'll do it. I'll sleep with Mawatari. But... if I do, it's over between us. I can't marry you. Is that what you want? It's not like that. I'm asking you to do this so I can marry you. Because I love you. You're contradicting yourself. All right then, I'll do it. Oh, it's you. I appreciate you coming, but I'm busy tonight. I came jewelry shopping. So you made up your mind? So give me a really nice one, then. Very well. This was supposed to be for my daughter. It belonged to Manchurian royalty. It's my most precious one. I'd be happy to give it to you. - It's marvelous. - You like it? It's like a dream. Jewels are always good. They always sell, and they have a lasting charm, like you. Don't rush things, I'm staying all night. Take your time. Old men have no patience! They're suspicious, too. They need assurance. My apologies. Ex-army men tend to be too rough. Let's take a bath together and go for a drink. I don't want to. Are you angry? I'm shy. You're cute! All right, I'll take one first. How did it go? Happy? Why don't you laugh or something? You got what you wanted. And I got this. You sold me for just some figures, but he paid a high price for me. - Masako! - Stop it! If it's a kiss you want, you can kiss the figures instead. I'll kiss this. It's a rock, but it has more warmth than you. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. By marrying me? With a honeymoon in a Pioneer? I'll make you happy. With a girl who let an old man take her? I don't care. You're a monster. Masako... Can you kiss this, too? Goodbye. I'll give you this to remember me by. The X amount plus a million yen makes 1.08 million yen. Thanks, Onoda. It's thanks to Asahina, sir, not me. You saved me. You saved the Pioneer... No, our entire company. Thank you. What about our price for the Pioneer? It'll be 90,000 less than the Mypet, so that's 990,000 yen. Even at that price, we have a profit margin. - When will you reveal the price? - We start sales tomorrow. Should we wait until the newspaper deadline? Yes, let's do that. I'm wary of spies. Asahina... I made you do a terrible thing. I'm sorry, but when the car goes on sale, I'll make you department head. Cheer up. I'd like you to return this to Mawatari. Now that's funny. He'll be both surprised and disappointed to see it. I'd love to see Mawatari's face. Shall we celebrate, boss? We've worked so hard together for so long. I've never been so happy. I'm fortunate to have men like you. Thanks. It's the sales department. Yes, it's me. Wonderful. Keep on selling them. Orders are pouring in. Numbers one to 100 are already sold. Now we can expand. Maybe we'll hire twenty more men when we start on a new model. It'll be cramped in this room. I can't believe what happened! Because the amateur won over the veterans? That's not it. There's been an accident! What are you talking about? The Pioneer conked out at a railway crossing! The Jin Express ran on that line and rammed into her! But they just went on sale. It's too soon. - Check the newspapers, then. - Where did it happen? Chigasaki, they say. TRAIN COLLIDES WITH SPORTS CAR AT CHIGASAKI CROSSING There was nothing wrong with the car. It was sold in Yokohama and had only gone 18 miles. It can go between 6,000 and 12,000 miles without a check-up. It couldn't have broken down. It had to be the driver's fault. Asahina, what happened to the driver? He's safe. He jumped out just before the collision. - Where is he? - At Chigasaki police station. He's being questioned for obstructing the railway. - His name? - A Mr. Yoshino. He's president of a lumber company and a city assemblyman, too. Check on him. Obstructing the railway? Of course not! The accident was caused by the car breaking down. The car's a lemon! I've had a perfect driving record for seven years. I've even been commended for it. I can tell if it's the car or me at fault. So you're saying it's not your fault at all? What kind of idiot would fork out a fortune for a new car, and then trash it on purpose? The number of that car is 620001. - It's car number one. - So what? You wouldn't understand, but it's important to car buffs. I have an Empress and a Sky Rocket, both number-one cars. I prize them highly, but... But the Tiger's engineer says the car was fine. They're just a bunch of liars. Making killer cars and then blaming it on the buyers! No matter. I'll sue Tiger Motors! ACCIDENT CAUSES SCANDAL "STOP MAKING PIONEERS!" SAYS YOSHINO THE PIONEER IS A JUNK CAR! THE PIONEER IS A MURDER WEAPON ON WHEELS!! This is a warning to Tiger Motors! Admit the Pioneer is defective, and discontinue its production! If you don't, I will do everything in my power to reveal the poor efforts of the Tiger Corporation to justify what they did to the public and I'll even reveal it to the Lord above! I don't know anything about cars. I shelled out a lot of money and it was totaled almost immediately! Moreover, I almost got killed! I hereby declare... that Tiger Motors is a criminal company! They manufacture... What's Yoshino after? - Money? - I suppose so. So why not pay him off? No, it would prove he's right. There's no fault with our car. We needn't give in. It'll affect sales if he makes more trouble. Yamato salesmen are showing accident pictures to warn people. They say the Pioneer is dangerous and shouldn't be purchased. Some are saying that production has stopped. Buyers are canceling orders. It's tough on sales. Yoshino is just a thorn in our side. Isn't it wiser to shut him up with money, Onoda? He's just a dog, so let him bark! The question is to find his master. Meaning? Yamato, I think. He'll run if we prove it's Yamato's plot. Sir, please be patient a bit longer. I'll find out the truth. Every company takes special care with the first off their production line. Car number one is a special car. But if my number one conks out after only 18 miles, the other cars must be too dangerous to drive. In short, the Pioneer is a murder weapon on wheels! He's showed his true colors. Asahina, did Yoshino really buy that number one? No mistake about it. He made an advance order two months ago. It's hard to get hold of the number one. Check out how he did it. Boss, I found out about Yoshino. He was a special agent under Mawatari's command in the Imperial Manchurian Army. I thought as much. But that doesn't prove Mawatari was behind this. A former Manchurian army man? Mawatari's a sly one. He thinks this is still Manchuria. Boss... I spoke to the sales department. He got the go-ahead from head office to buy it. Someone from our office? Shimamoto, the former Executive Secretary to the Director. Shimamoto? Oh, it's you, Onoda. - I want to talk to you, Shimamoto. - Talk? I've got something to say, too. Come on! You're in a good mood. I run around to a lot of backwater places. If not alcohol, what should I be drinking? So, why was I moved to a new department? - You know why. - No, I don't. I might not be so smart, but I didn't slip up on my work. Tell me why! You can't tell me? Then I'll tell you. You hate the fact that I'm a little slow. So you ruin my life just for that? Condemning me to waste my life running around all over? What makes you so great? I'd like to kill you! - I'd like to kill you, too. - What? - You sold our number one to Yoshino. - Yoshino? Who told you to do it? Mawatari told you, right? I don't know. I don't know anything. - Stop pretending. You're the spy! - Me, a spy? Yes, you. We found you out! No, it's not me! You bribed the nurse at the hospital! - No, I'm innocent. - And you're always at the Pandora. Did the Madame bribe you into becoming a spy? - You're wrong. - Don't pretend! Believe me! You sold out the Pioneer to Mawatari! - No. - Liar! I'll prove you wrong. Let me see the nurse. Please! No, I'm sure it's this man. There's no mistake. You... Damn it! No violence. I'll report you. Do it. Let's get things straight! Perjury's a crime. Don't worry, I'm telling the truth. Or do you have proof that he's right? - You'd be fired, too. - I don't care. There are plenty of jobs for nurses. I also have money saved up. She's lying. Please believe me! Hey... I'll increase your savings. I'd like to pay you 500,000 yen. Well? Don't worry. Rest assured I'll give it to you. In return, tell me who's really behind this. I see. I'll visit father on my way home. - Maybe I'll buy some melons. - Yes, that sounds good. - Hey. - Oh, what a surprise! Well, Miss... No, Mrs. Hiraki, you're as beautiful as ever. Nothing but flattery! I'm old now. - I'm borrowing Mr. Hiraki tonight. - Please do. Very well. Excuse me. What is it you want? - Oguri told me to ask for your help. - Why? We're making you Head of Planning. Congratulations. The formal announcement's tomorrow. Let's talk things over beforehand. Come with me. Come in. It's supposed to be secret. And her? I'll introduce you first. Hey! Good evening, Mr. Hiraki. Mr. Hiraki, you know her well, don't you? Yes. She's the head nurse in my father-in-law's ward. - You're on very friendly terms, right? - Don't joke around. We just greet each other when I visit. I've hardly ever spoken to her. - So when did you tap the intercom? - Intercom? What are you talking about? You asked her to bug his hospital room. Don't be absurd! Why would I have her spy for me? It's no good lying, Mr. Hiraki. I've already confessed. Stop lying! He paid three times more than you, so I broke our promise. Don't be angry. Money moves old hags like me! It cost me 500,000 yen, cheap if it's for the Pioneer. - I don't follow you at all. - I see. What's this check, then? There's your signature. Why does she have it? The game's up. Be a man. Hiraki, stop playing dumb! I asked her to do it. - You admit it? - I asked her to spy! You can go, nurse. - Give me the check back. - I never want to see you again. How scary! Excuse me. PLANNING DEPARTMENT AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY Why did you do it? Money? A woman? Or do you hate Mr. Oguri and me? - A woman. - A woman? What happened? Katsuko and... And Matoba, the man you think is spying for us. Matoba? What did he do? Sorry to interrupt your fun, but I must develop this. What did you photograph? - Your naked bodies. - Naked bodies? Yes... in black and white. They'll be something special. You two tricked me? That's right. Your wife would divorce you. Your firm would fire you. All right, I'll buy them. How much? They would ruin your life, so they'll be expensive. How much should we ask for, Katsuko? Well... You two! We're quite the loving couple. Any Yamato news she gets, I sell to Tiger. Whatever I get, she sells back to Yamato. We're both spies in this game. - Why don't we ask Mr. Mawatari? - Shall I? He's the brains behind this scheme, anyway. If it's money, I'll raise it somehow. I don't need money. What, then? Spy for me. Tell me the company secrets. I can't. It's my father's company. That would be betrayal. Destroy what he created. Isn't that amusing? I refuse. So should I show him these, then? They'd make him and your wife weep. Look at this. It's safer to do as I say. There was nothing I could do. I couldn't face ruining my whole life. I understand. One more question. Was it you who sold Yoshino car number one? - Did Mawatari ask you to do it? - No! I had nothing to do with that. If you're admitting to one thing, you might as well tell me all. I didn't do it. I'm not involved with that. Stop pretending, Hiraki! I'm going home. Open it. No way, not until you confess. - You're locking me in? - Yes. Are you a detective? Is this a police station? How dare you! This is our department. And I'm an industrial spy. Say it! Mawatari told you to do it, right? Tell me! I don't know! Are you going to torture me now? You've become more like a detective. You can beat me all you want. Confess! Kill me if you want to! Sorry I was rough. I know why you won't confess. Unlike spying, obstructing a train is a crime. You'd be arrested and sent to jail. - No wonder you won't talk. - You're wrong... I know nothing about it. Let's do it this way, then. Even if you tell me, I won't report it to the police or have it written up. I'll keep the secret deep within my heart. I just love the Pioneer. If it was a plot, I'd be satisfied. If you tell the truth, I'll keep the fact that you were a spy a secret, too. I'll tell no one. It's because I feel sorry for your family. So how about telling me the truth? Trust me. I don't tell lies. Listen... we've been friends a long time. We started at the company together and worked in the same department. We've stayed out late at bars, talking until sunrise. Remember? They were the good old days. I'll think we'll always be friends. Please trust my words as a friend and tell me the truth. Why are you silent? Don't you trust me? You'll really keep your word? I will. Of course. - It's a man's promise. - So... Tell me now. Yes, Mawatari asked me... ...to turn car number one over to Yoshino. - Is that true? - Yes. What was Mawatari's plan? He said he'd use that car when it came to a critical moment. I see. Then Yoshino crashed it on purpose? He laughed and said it was a shame to damage a new car. Thanks for telling me. All right, men, it's okay to come out. - Did you get it? - Perfectly. It's one of those portable ones. - What's this? - What does it look like? A tape recorder. This is the microphone. What are you using this for? - We need evidence. - Evidence? For what? For the police and our company witness. This man is our witness, the company lawyer. But you... You said you wouldn't report it. That was the only way to get you to talk. You tricked me? Yes, just like you tricked me, until now. - You're cruel. - Cruel? Do you know, Hiraki, how much suffering you've caused me? And how much loss for the company? Go to jail and atone for your crimes! - Instead of jail, I'd rather... - What, kill yourself? Onoda... If I die, will you hush it up for me? Stop talking nonsense! I'll make it public whether you die or not. We'll present the train accident as a conspiracy plotted by Mawatari. It's the only way to increase our sales and win against Mawatari! Die if you like, I don't care! Onoda, please... don't expose me. - I shall! - No matter what? I know why you want to die. No prison term and no disgrace for your children. But you're an important witness. I'm taking you to the police! You're a murderer! - You dog! - What? He deserved it. Boss... Why did you trick him? You said you'd keep his secret. They're the same as police tactics. Are we policemen? We're industrial spies! If it's for our company and a new car, is it right to blackmail, trick, kill... ...do anything we like? You mean we should sit on our hands and let the company go to ruin? What's a company? What's a secret? What's a sports car? Are they more important than people? Do we have to kill to protect the company? Grow up. It's all about winning. I defeated Mawatari. He'll be fired and maybe get sent to prison. Defeated him? You lost to Mawatari. What? You've become as dirty as he is. You'll stop at nothing to get what you want. You're just a warmonger. Why don't you take off this business suit and change into a khaki uniform? Asahina, you're my successor. You'll be the new department head here. Don't be naive. Be an industrial spy with guts! An industrial spy? Employing bribery, intimidation, violence, theft, prostitution, confinement! You mean become just like the Yakuza? You can't get hung up on morals, you'll just feel remorse. Remorse? I want to live like a decent human being... ...not like you or Mawatari. I'd like to resign as of today. Please open the door. You're too naive. Asahina! Asahina... What an idiot! THE TRAGIC END OF AN INDUSTRIAL SPY DIRECTOR MAWATARI SUMMONED SALES OF PIONEERS SURGE MAWATARI RESIGNS FROM YAMATO Do you think we can get married? Yes, we can. You've become your former self. My new job is with a small store. I may end up just a plain employee. That's why we can get married. Come... kiss me. A Pioneer, wasn't it? We were supposed to go on our honeymoon in one. I was such a fool. But it's a beautiful car. That car's dirty. It's dirty... black as pitch. THE END
