We beat him a lot, but he remains tongue-tied. Has his tongue been cut-off? - No. Are his lips made up of stone? - No. Then, why didn't he reveal the secret? We beat him a lot, but still If you know how to beat, a person can vomit blood. Inspector Ajay Shastri. Nice, that's good At least the blood shed came to some use. Forget about the blood that was shed. If it were up to me I'd write my country's name with every drop of my blood. I know there's enough life left in you. But this place knows how to squeeze the life out of someone. Do you know who I am? The one who colors clothes is called 'Randeza'. The one who colours life with death. I'm Changeza. This snake, too, is a terrorist like us. I'm asking you for the last time. Tell me where have you kept my five men? Oh. So, you won't listen to me. This snake's venom can destroy even the mightiest. But it died after biting you. What are you? Who are you? I'm a brave police constable. And a son to a mother of a high self-esteem. My father was honoured with many medals for his bravery. After his death, my uncle took my sister under his care. My mother... brought me up by selling those medals. With the last medal, she brought poison instead of food. We both drank it but she died and I survived. I'm not interested in your past. I'm interested only in your present. How did you survive the snake bite? Now, you tell me, if that poison couldn't kill me then how could a snake end my life? You want to know where your five men are, right? I've booked their admission in hell. What? Now it's your turn. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir. - Well done, Ajay Shastri, well done. Thank you, sir. Terrorists were a little active in this area. But you've uprooted their very roots. You've accomplished your mission in this area. You've been transferred. Sir, I'm willing to go wherever you send me. But it'd be better, if you would allow me to assist you here in the headquarters. Wherever you go think that I'm with you and you're with me. But what if a day comes when I fail to see it that way? Ajay, you'll listen to what I have to say today, right? And I'll agree to you when you get your chance. Sir, I never could see my father or a teacher who I could look up to. You are the only good human being I could find. Ajay, policemen should never be so emotional. Now go and make arrangements to leave. Join your duty. Why, is some adage coming to your mind? Sir, you didn't tell me where I'm being transferred? Jagannathpur. Thank you, sir. Sada, come out of the car. Oh, Mr. Ghosal, hello. I said come out of the car. No, please don't go. I'm afraid. I haven't done anything then why are you afraid? We just want to ask you something. Then we'll leave you. Don't anger sir for no reason. Now come on out. Please don't hit him. First tell me, what's my fault? You murdered Nitin Shah. - No. And you threaten Acharya on phone, isn't it? No, this is a lie. I'm not a goon. I'm just the leader of the labourers union. Do you really run a union or a goon's den? You fired this bullet. And this revolver, too, belongs to you. Take him along with us. After he's dead, get his fingerprints on this. Fingerprints you know. - Please, forgive me. I have a wife, a child and an ageing mother. Shut up. Now, your photo will be published in papers saying that you died in an encounter. Now no one can save you. No one. Don't kill him. Don't kill him. Now, you all, too, should run away. You're messing with the wrong person. Run away. Otherwise you'll fall prey to this twisted encounter. Your gun, your bullet, your fingerprints. Understand? Yes. Let's go. - Yes, sir. I'd read in seventh grade, "Shove, when a push doesn't work". Is Acharya there? - Yes. Thank you. - No. Acharya has ordered you to wear anklet and then enter. Do you understand? - Hey, what nonsense is this? This nonsense is Acharya's old habit. Okay, then I'll meet him later. Listen. Listen. If you leave without meeting him, you might lose your job. Now, it's your choice, job or anklet? Once you people lose your uniform you look just like a skinned goat. Too costly, isn't it? Think again. Your job or anklet? Welcome. Please come. Walk in tune. In tune. You have no sense of tune. You don't know how to walk while wearing an anklet or to use a revolver. I felt, now that you're transferred I'd thought of getting this job done from you and reward you for the same. But you're just an imbecile. Who can kill only bugs. That's his old habit. Mr. Acharya, I don't know who he was? He showed up all of a sudden. The next time I see him, I'll shoot him. Stop it. Your dialogues have no value now. I'll get my job done from the one who replaces you. Get out. But in tune in tune. Learn to walk in tune. Get out. Get out. In tune. In tune. Amazing. What fun. Oh, God, his gait. Good morning, sir. What's all this? The new officer had called from the railway station. He'll reach here in 15 minutes. We are here to welcome him. Welcome, sir, Welcome. - Welcome, sir. Ajay Shastri. I'm the station in-charge, Inspector Ghosal. I think, I've seen you before. Nice. We often used this dialogue on girls in our college days. Come in. I've heard that Ajay Shastri is a very strict police officer. Don't say that. If the superior's strict juniors don't get to earn on the side. Take this. Now my duty ends. And mine begins. But... I want to ask you something. Sure. So it's you? - Yes. I always reach my place of transfer in advance. This helps me recognise the scum that inhabit there. So that it's easier to deal with them later. Mr. Ghosal, what was that man's fault whom you'd planned to kill in a false encounter? On whose order, were you ready to do so? I'm asking you something, Mr. Gosal. Answer me. I don't deem it necessary to answer you, Inspector Ajay. It's extremely necessary. Otherwise, you know that methods police can resort to for getting their answers. Will you answer or would you like to step in? You're taking the law in your hands. Before taking the law in my hands I get my hands on evidence first. Laxman. - Yes, sir. This is the revolver and the video cassette which has recorded the entire episode right from you stopping Sada's car, till your departure. But, Inspector Ajay, no one has filed a case against me. That, too, will be done. I'm the eyewitness. An attempt to murder. You'll lose your job, and get few years of imprisonment. Tell me, under whose orders were you to kill him? Acharya. He's like the king here. He's also an Member of Legislative Assembly. I've even hear that he'll soon become the Minister of police. I'll decide his fate. Now it's time to decide yours. Forgive me. Please, forgive me. I'll forgive you on one condition. What condition? Till date, you danced to Acharya's tune. Now call him and throw a couple of supreme abuses at him. What? - Yes. When a man works under fear he slowly becomes incompetent. When you'll abuse him, the man inside you will rise. Come on, call him. Otherwise He'll get me killed. Don't reveal your name. But he'll recognise my voice. Speak with a heavy voice. - Heavy voice? Come on, call him. - Yes. Yes? - You wretch, scumbag, idiot, mongrel. who can it be? Now, do you feel somewhat relieved? - Yes. Have you vented little bit of your frustration? - Yes. Does it feel nice? - Yes. Keep abusing. - Yes. This is an exercise to strengthen your soul. - Yes. And this uniform won't be a matter of ridicule, but pride. Excuse me, sir. Sir, Acharya's shemale Gopi's here. Shemale? Cant' call that person a male or a female. That's why 'Shemale'. Take a look for yourself. Acharya has sent a bouquet for you and has called you at his residence. This is his old habit. You gave your message. Now, you can leave. How can I leave? I want an answer. You hit my man, why? I read in seventh grade "It's better to nip it in the bud." You don't stand in the way of an opposing force. I am the force. You'll have to pay a very heavy price for coming to this town. He's not just bragging. Along with music, he's a master in the world of crime, too. That's why he's called, Acharya, the teacher. I'm not "Shastri" just for the sake of it. I'm philosopher of the world of crime. Hence, called, "Shastri". You ask him, why did he slap me? You're drinking tea. You're drinking it from the cup because I'm sure the tea wasn't too hot. But if the cup was hotter than the tea, what would you do? Smash it. Absolutely right. You sent this gentleman with flowers. He, too, acted out of his bounds. He should be thankful that I didn't smash him just slapped him. You don't treat everyone with the same yardstick, moron. My insolence was apparent to you. But what about his insolence? He didn't greet you at all. Utter disrespect. Which inspector have you sent here? So you're talking about Ajay Shastri? Yes, him. His rhythm or tune doesn't match with that of ours. Mr. Acharya, he's out most capable inspector. I assure you he'll get the entire area under his control in no time. And criminals will disappear into thin air. And, of course, you'll get the credit for it. I don't want any credit card. Get him transferred immediately. Did he make a mistake or did he misbehave with you? Hey, do I need to give you the details to get an ordinary police officer transferred? Mr. Acharya, he's just arrived there. And it'll take few days to get him transferred. Speak in tune with me. Hello, Mr. Commissioner, don't feel bad. It's his old habit. Bye. Janki, your brother has called. My brother's call. Sorry, Rita. What's the matter? Brother. First, breathe. I don't care about that. Okay, tell me. I won't. Okay, let me tell you something. It's Goddess Kali's veneration. When are you coming to the village? - I won't tell you. I will be reaching the village on the 20th. Yes, I know that. Annu had mentioned the date in her letter. It's 20th. Okay, I will be waiting for you in the village for the veneration. First, reach the village. You always talk more. That's why the country suffers. Bye. It's good that you didn't come in the police officer's uniform. - Why? I don't know why, but I get frightened. But why? Because you police officers kill a lot of goons in encounters. Most of them are just rumours. But why should that frighten you? I am ready to sacrifice my life for you. Enough. Enough. Let it be. And you talk about sacrificing your life. Did you talk to sir about our marriage? This is the third occasion of worship of Goddess Kali. This time around, I am determined to talk to him. Definitely talk to him. Now, I am of marriageable age. What if my marriage is fixed with some other guy? Don't worry in the next occasion of worship of Goddess Kali we three will offer offerings together. I hope you understand who this third person will be? Where are you going? Wait. If any of my brothers sees me with you it will lead to a fight. They won't agree to get us married then. I will leave now. We will meet at the same place tomorrow. It's wierd, you can't be in love openly. she was right, all her brothers are insane. Babloo, don't be afraid. - Yes. I am with you. Okay. - We will defeat them all. Are you ready? - Yes. I am standing over there. Kabaddi-Kabaddi, Kabaddi-Kabaddi Kabaddi-Kabaddi, Kabaddi-Kabaddi Come on. Good. Kabaddi-Kabaddi, Kabaddi-Kabaddi- Hey! Hey! Kabaddi-Kabaddi, Kabaddi-Kabaddi - Hey! Hey! Come on. Kabaddi-Kabaddi, Kabaddi-Kabaddi Catch him. Come on. Very good. Others have been defeated. Yes. - They were weak. But don't worry. Let him come. We will make him bite the dust. - Yes, don't worry. Come on. - Catch him! That's great. He's done for. Village head, hadn't I warned you not to enter into a combat with my men. Bhima, go, just one is left. Defeat him. Come on. You fatso. You fatso. Come on. Come on. - Kabaddi-Kabaddi Come on. Come on. - Kabaddi-Kabaddi You fatso. Kabaddi-Kabaddi - Come on. Kabaddi-Kabaddi - Run! Run away! Run! Bhima, doesn't matter. Let him come now. Defeat him. Make sure you defeat him easily. Darshan, go. - Yes. Come on, go. Come on, go ahead. Kabaddi-Kabaddi - What are you doing? I am not afraid. Kabaddi-Kabaddi - Come on, go! Kabaddi-Kabaddi Don't be afraid. Go. - Kabaddi-Kabaddi Village head, send someone who is brave enough to face us. Someone who is the son of his mother. Send him - Kabaddi-Kabaddi Kabaddi-Kabaddi Our hero is here. Yes! Kabaddi-Kabaddi Kabaddi-Kabaddi - Catch him. Kabaddi-Kabaddi - Ajay Kabaddi-Kabaddi! - Come on. Yes, come on. Remember one thing. Never challenge someone by using his weakness. Sometimes, overconfidence can cause a severe setback. Come on. Let's go now. We will deal with him later. Please, maintain silence. Sir's family will reach here within a short time. As per our customs he will be worshipping the Goddess, first. Please, maintain silence. Get lost. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Don't try to intimidate me. Don't try to intimidate me. I don't care if you are an inspector. I am sir's most favoured man. I am afraid of no one. Hail Goddess Kali. I have not committed any mistake. Sir has ordered that no one will worship the Goddess before he does. Also that no one should climb the steps of the temple before he does. Then why don't you stop me? religious chants religious chants religious chants religious chants Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. 'I will have to deal with them with due diligence.' 'On one hand, it's the question of the Goddess's worship' 'and on the other hand, I want to marry his daughter'. Hello, sir. You offered your worship before me. Thereby, you have deferred from the age-old customs. What do you really want? Don't feel bad. This will not cause any trouble to you. He is lying, Father. The people who would consider our strength to be greatest would now mock at us that someone else performed the veneration before us. No, sir. They will praise you as they would earlier. First come, first serve, is a rule in any business. And for that matter, this is a very pious place. Then why shouldn't the same rule be applicable here? Isn't this a faulty practice? - Yes, of course it is. Yes, it's wrong. Just now, I had a word with sir. Even, he is against this age-old faulty practice. He too, believes in first come, first serve, principle. Now, there would be no hurdle between God and his devotee. Long live, sir. Long live - Sir! Long live - Sir! Long live - Sir! He has ruined our reputation today. If this continues, the villagers would no longer respect us. You people are cowards. Why didn't you oppose then? Because you too remained silent there. You too remain silent. Listen, learn to do what you threaten to. Yes. Congratulations, sir. You are the most talked about person these days You are for all praises in the village. Have you come to add to my problems? No, not at all. Don't feel bad, Inspector. But I understand people like you. I know the methods of dealing with police officers like you. You are absolutely right. But not all police officers are like you. Some are so cunning and courageous that they defeat even the best. And they make them to act upon their wishes. Who are you talking about? Inspector Ajay Shastri. Ajay. Ajay. - What happened? The thing is, a drama is organised after Goddess Kali's worship every year. This year, from the city we have invited Meenabai for a dance. Khadak Singh is obsessed about her. The reputation of our village will be ruined, if... Don't worry, I will look into the matter. Okay, dear. Meenabai, that's great. The palanquin is waiting for you. Meenabai, today, you will sing and dance in our program. I will make you my wife. I have come here to sing in the worship of Goddess Kali. I am not interested in marrying you. Would you like to dance or suffer at my hands? Would you prefer to be my wife or die? Would you like to run away or get beaten by me? Don't cry in pain, just smile as if nothing has happened. It will be good for your reputation. Smile please, a little more, a little more. Now, better leave this place with a smile on your face. I will not tell anyone that I beat you up. Go. - Where should I leave from? From here. Yes. Oh, my God! Come on, get down. Be quick. Mummy, I was beaten up. My bottle Brother. Brother, why are you saluting me? Mother used to say father wished that I should become an inspector and then he would salute me. I wish you to become an I.P.S. officer. Hence, I will salute you from today. And in case, I fail to fulfil your aspirations? Still, I will continue to salute you. Once I consider you to be an officer then I always would. My brother. How are you? Sushma, meet me in the evening. Uncle Krishna, look who has come? Uncle, bless me. - My dear, how are you? Aunt, how are you? - Always be happy, dear. Annu. - Yes. Janki has come back. Janki has come? Really? - Yes. I will go meet her right now. Aunt, leave me till the door. Come on, Aunt. Okay, fine. Come on. He beat me mercilessly. Is this a way to beat someone? Aunt What are you doing, you fool? You lazy man, making an excuse of being ill. Get back to work. - Yes. Come. Come. Janki. Janki. There's no one like you in the village. Oh, Janki. Janki, you look so beautiful when you smile. Don't do that or I will end up crying. No, Janki - Janki, she has a very bad habit. Brother. First, she makes you laugh and then she makes you cry. Just maintain a distance with her. Wait, I will be back. What did you say? Just, what you heard. Did you forget yesterday's beating, Inspector? Brother, what did you forget? Tell me what you forgot. Well She thinks I forgot to get a gift. Is it? - I am just waiting to give you the gift when you both are together. Come along with me. - Let's see, what the gift is. Look at him, he met the girls and forgot that his friends are waiting for him. I am no less either. You are so silly Annu, this is for you. For me? Brother has a nice choice, isn't it? I have brought a gift for you too. - For me? It's kept in the room, go wear it and come. - Yes! You can place a photo of your choice in the locket. Either God, or a person or an animal. Which category do you belong to? All the three. Janki hasn't come yet. Janki, have you gone to sleep? No, not at all, I am coming. What's this? - Oh, Janki. Brother, the clothes you bought are not of my size. These bangles too. Then why did you wear them? Just to make you laugh. You made yourself a laughing stock just to see us laugh? Don't be so good. It's not good. Go change the clothes. You should try to remain in touch with her. But you meet her hardly once or twice a year. That would lead to problems, isn't it? Girls mature faster, do you know that? Now, at least will you remain in touch with her? Absolutely not. I will go to the city to buy clothes for my sister. Is it? How will you go? The car keys are with me. Annu! Janki! - Yes. Your brother loves you very much, isn't it? Yes, Annu, he loves me a lot. Our parents passed away in our early childhood but he has played a role of both my father and mother. Do you know, once, what he did? What did he do? That's enough, Brother. I will do it now. I will have to complete the henna occasion in your marriage. So, sit quietly. Whenever I remember that day, I get emotional. Today, brother left for the city. Don't worry. Janki, he will return soon. It's getting dark, let's go home. Come on. Janki, wait. Brother Anand. - Yes. Come on. Brother Anand, you are going towards the fields, isn't it? - Yes. Please escort Janki home. Yes, come with me. Annu, you did a good thing. I was afraid to go home all alone anyway. Okay. - Okay. No. Brother No! It can't happen. Aunt, this can't happen. No. Janki! No, Janki. Oh, Goddess, an unfortunate incident has happened. Janki. Oh, Goddess. What? What happened? What happened? Village head, look what has happened to Janki. Janki. Janki. Janki. Dear Janki. Janki My dear Janki Janki. - Who did this to her? My dear Who did this to her? My dear Janki Look, what has happened. Sir's son, Anand. Anand! Stop, stop! Shamsher, look there! Here Anand, come here quickly. Come on, let's go. Be quick. I will see that your work is done. - Yes. Now you may go. - Hello. Congratulations on becoming the Minister of Police. And that too at a right time. It is his old habit to do right things at the right time. You came alone to congratulate me. Father-in-law and others didn't come, why? No. Brother-in-law, the thing is Anand has raped and murdered a girl of our village. He killed her? - Yes. He has done it surreptitiously. Neither any evidence, nor any punishment. But the girl's elder brother is an inspector. He will not let it settle so easily. What's her brother's name? Ajay Shastri. Oh. That philosopher. Now, I will ask him why had he slapped me. - What? He had slapped you? It's his old habit to get slapped. Ajay Shastri belongs to your village. But he refused to recognise me. He did not attend your marriage too. Listen, don't take abrupt decisions. Especially, stop father-in-law. - Yes. He is a police officer. Whatever I do, will be well-planned. I will beat him at his own game. DSP Mathur. - Yes, sir. I never heard a word of what you said. But I have understood you. I know you want to be transferred to some big city. - Yes. And you also want a promotion, isn't it? - Yes. How did you come to know about my aspirations? I can read faces. It's his old habit. 'Brother, why are you saluting me?' 'I want you to become an I.P.S. officer.' 'Hence, I will start saluting you from today itself.' 'What if I fail to fulfil your aspirations?' 'Still, I will salute you.' 'Once I consider you to be an officer then I always would.' 'Let it be, Brother. I will do it on my own.' 'I will have to complete the henna' 'custom in your marriage, isn't it?' So, stay quiet. 'Brother.' Sir, I swear by Goddess Kali that I will not spare my sister's murderer. Sir, handover Anand to the police. He deserves punishment which will put an end to his story of crime. No, Father. If you try to hide him this saga will go a long way. There will be a lot of bloodshed. You will have to pay a heavy price for his deeds. Janki's brother has decided to kill Really? - Acharya has been elected as the new Minister of Police. Now, what will he do to Janki's brother? Sir's elder daughter Really? I've heard that she's very good. - Yes. She is like a Goddess. Come on, dear. Greetings. - Greetings. - Bless us, sir. Bless you. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Sister has come. Thank you. Thank you. - Sister. Annu, how are you? - I am fine. How are you? I am fine. How are you? - I am fine. Annu, you have grown up. It is his old habit to praise. I wanted to ask you something. Where is Anand? - Brother Anand is in his room. Okay. - Come, Sister. Here. Just look at your brother. He is so frightened. He looks gloomy. I think he doesn't get sound sleep at night. Yes, it does seem so. I think, he didn't have food for many days out of fear. He is a rogue, but look, he acts as if he is innocent. Let him be. Don't trouble him. He is my favourite brother-in-law. Anand, today, it will be the end of your fear. I have summoned Ajay here today. Here. He will be here soon. Take care of him. Your favourite one is leaving the room. Anand, the person you fear, will bow down to me. He will salute me in the presence of all. Look at him carefully, he doesn't bow down to you. He is being courageous. He will not be able to salute you as he is already injured. The gist of the story is he is fearless as ever. Shut up. What happened to your hand? I was injured. - You are lying. You deliberately had your hand plastered so that you could avoid saluting me. Ajay, bear one thing well in mind how much ever you try you can never defeat me. You too bear one thing well in mind. A storm however mighty, cannot move mountains. What about salutation, Brother-in-law? Brother-in-law, have a cold drink. Brother-in-law, what happened? Why are you mum? It's his old habit to stay mum after being defeated. Shut up! Beware. When your prayers are not answered sacrifice becomes imperative. You want to solve the matter legally. But, it will take a lot of time. I wonder where Anand must be hiding. Ajay, did you talk with the Commissioner? Yes. - Did you tell him everything about Acharya? Yes, he said there is nothing to be worried about. By now, he must have phoned at the police station. Sir, I have been sent by Inspector Bhanwar Lal. Anand is hiding in the bungalow near the jungle. It would be good if you come along with us. 'Anand is in that bungalow?' That's it. That's it. This is the place where Anand is hiding. Bhanwar Lal. You wanted Anand, isn't it? Here he is. He was the one who raped your sister and - Bhanwar Lal. Shut up. Now, he will deal with you. Anand, shoot him. You know if you shoot at him it will give him the maximum pain. Kill him. What are you waiting for? Just kill him. No! - Darshan? Come on. Catch him. - Come on. Catch him. He's got away. What have you done? Ajay, don't worry about me. Just try to save yourself. Nothing will happen to you. Let's go to the hospital first. - No. First, let's meet the DSP and give him a statement. It won't take much of our time. Just five minutes. If I report to him directly, the case will become stronger. Ajay, don't worry about me. I am very much in my senses. Let's go, let's go to the DSP first. For my sake. Make it fast, Ajay. You should not worry about me. I will get the DSP here. Okay? wait here Sir, please make it fast. Darshan is in my jeep. He is wounded. He was shot at while trying to save my life. Record his statement as soon as possible. But who shot him? Acharya's in-laws did it. And inspector Bhanwar Lal is also working for them. Just a minute. Let me get the tape recorder and the video camera. Ajay! Darshan. Darshan? Darshan? Oh, God. You have deliberately delayed it. You are responsible for his death. - Shut up. If you misbehave like this with your officers very soon, you will lose your job. Don't threaten me about my police job. There is a lot more to me than a police job. There is a lot more to me. Hello. Evershine estate agency? Yes, this is inspector Bhanwar Lal. Yes, I have just back after taking one month's leave. I have got it. I have got the whole thing. I am just coming to your place along with it. But I want the shop's key today. All right? Okay, okay. Mobile. It's here. Brother, Are you going out? Yes, Pooja, I am going out. Listen. Lock the doors carefully. Got it? And just in case you find anything fishy There is a loaded revolver kept in the drawer. Brother, a revolver? But why are you telling me about it? Silly girl. The job we are holding forces us to make many enemies. And you never know when and how anyone would plan to exact revenge. So, you should not hesitate to shoot. Okay? I will leave now. - Yes. Be careful. And close this door from inside. Yes. Brother, be back soon. - Don't worry. Who's there? Who's that? Who's there? Hello? - Hello, hello, Brother. Tell me. - I am afraid. It seems as if someone has entered the house. Brother, please get back soon. - Don't be afraid, I am just coming. I will be there in a moment. That day, you were right in saying that being hit by Anand would be most painful to me. After that, I started doing a research, to know who should hit you, to give you the maximum pain. And I found that it's going to be your sister. Who. Who's there? Don't come close? I will fire at you. I am warning you for the last time. Who are you? Tell me. Otherwise, I will open the door and fire at you. Who's who's there? I will fire at you. You were the one who fired first. So, you are the first one to die. Now, it's Anand's turn. Did you hear? Inspector Bhanwar Lal was shot dead by his blind sister accidentally. Five bullets. He always disrespected other's sisters. So, he got killed by his sister. I salute everyone young and old. Gopi? Is it you? - Yes, it's me. How come are you here all of a sudden? Acharya has an old habit to kill. That's why I am here. In fact, sister-in-law is pregnant. So, I have come here to take Annu with me to help her. Aunt. Please come. Sister? Oh, Annu, it's you? - Sister. Who did you come with? Brother-in-law sent Gopi there. Why? - He sent a message that you are pregnant? That's it. I got this news and came here immediately. Without making any further delays. Congratulations, Sister. Annu, leave this place immediately if possible. Why? I am not pregnant. It's your - It's your brother-in-law's wicked plan. As you were not ready to come here we had to lie. What's wrong in it? I just wanted you to stay close to each other. Eat, dine and make merry. Gossip around with each other and just enjoy. And yes. I have instructed my men to take your special care. Right? - No Send me to my house. I will definitely do it. I will definitely do it. But before that, let me do what I want to. - It's his old habit. He did it. "She kills me with her eyes." Sister, brother-in-law is... - Don't speak about it to me. This is not new for me. Have you been tolerating all this? What option do I have? If I confront him I will get to stay back in my maternal house. And are you in a good condition, there? Speak up? Here at least, it might be an eyewash but I get respect here. If I leave him what treatment am I going to get in my maternal house? So, it's better to stay here. Isn't it? That's all right, Sister. But I can't make such compromise. I will commit suicide. No, Annu, don't do that ever. Don't do that ever. It would be better that you take sleeping pills tonight and have a sound sleep. Why? - Otherwise, you are going to scream, cry throb in pain, and bang your heads. You might even commit a suicide. So it's better that you take this and go to have a sound sleep. Just get away. "She kills me with her eyes." "She'll take my life one day." 'Hey, just don't worry, next time when we go to worship goddess Kali, all three of us will go together.' 'Do you know who this third one is?' Brother-in-law, you here? - Yes, it's me! You just take off your clothes fast. What? - once I finish it I have to go for the inauguration of women's welfare organisation. Okay? Come on, come on, just make it fast. No. - Just take off your clothes fast. It's all happening within the family. Brother-in-law and sister-in-law. Come on, come on, just make it fast. Hey just take off your sari. Take your sari off. Take it - No! I will scream. - It won't help. Your sister is already sleeping after taking the pills. You just take off your clothes fast, once its over I have to go to the meeting. Come on, stop. - Sister! Where are you going? Stop. No, sister? I have got you. - No. I will hit you. What are you doing? You want to kill, me. Are you mad? If I die, your sister will become a widow. Hearing this, your father who is already a heart patient, will also die. And your brothers will be hanged. Are you mad? Just throw it away. - No. I say stop. No. - I say stop. Just accept it. Sister? Sister? - Be quiet. Ajay! Hey, you Hey, Hey, just run away from here. Just go away from here. No, no. Don't kill him. For God sake don't kill him. Have some mercy on him. Please don't kill him. Sir, could you just tell me, why did you slap me so hard on that day. Come on tell me. I had come across a proverb in my seventh which means, someone else makes a mistake and someone else is punished for it. - What? Mistake punishment, punishment mistake. The one who's sitting there? Mistake punishment, punishment mistake. Sir, I have already cleared my confusion. And you? Did you finish your work? Did she salute you? She Bloody Eunuch. The day I had been to city for the sake of Janki that day, I got it for you. 'Anu, whenever brother goes anywhere, he always' 'brings something for you.' 'Why don't you get something for him?' 'I suggest you to give him something invaluable' 'that when compared with whatsoever' 'he has given to you till now seems insignificant.' Just wear it fast. Ajay? Your sister has done the right thing, by giving me a call at the Police station. Did sister, give a call to you? Yes. One of my men will drop you at your home. We have met each other after such a long gap? Don't you have anything to talk with me? Do you... Do you do you still love me? Come on, say it. Have you started hating me? Why don't you even express your anger for the simple reason that I belong to a family which is responsible for... And it's me, who sent Janki along with Anand. Why don't you take revenge on me? - Annu? What should I do? I sometimes feel that I will someday burst like some explosives. Or else, I feel that I should take poison and kill myself. I pass each moment in great pain and agony but am still alive, just in this hope that, may be someday I might be of some help to you. Otherwise, I really can't do anything for you. I can't even shed my tears for Janki. You don't need to do it. A person who can control his tears, can never ever be controlled by anyone in this word. Come. Commissioner, just listen to me very carefully. The Commissioner whom you have replaced I got him transferred to the home guard department. And the one, who was there before him. I forcefully got him retired. I came to know that later on he committed a suicide. You have just two years of service with you. No body wants to spoil his service record in the later years. You too won't want the ship getting wrecked just when it's about to touch the shores. Okay, sir, just today itself, I will ask Ajay to resign. No, I don't want his resignation. Just kick the rascal out of the department. Suspend him. Immediately. Sorry Ajay. Just let the sorry be, sir. Ajay, all my sympathies are with you. Please sir, please. I don't need your sympathies, at all. I am not dead. I am alive. And even If I die, it will be a heroic death. And not the one, dying like a coward, like you. I will always support you. What kind of support is this? Sir, you take an oath, you will never ever have any sympathies for me while I am still alive and never even shed tears, when I am dead. People call you a commissioner, you are supposed to be a real man. You still have not said anything like shut up to me. You must be thinking, that you showed me some sympathy and I started crossing all the limits. To whom should I tell all this? There are people like Anand and Prayas who consider law to be nothing more than a saleable commodity. So, when I met you I got this feeling that law is not blind. But you you are in no way different from them. Just tell me, sir. How many people have lost their uniforms, in order to let you save yours. Do you have some count? Ajay, I think you are not aware about the rules and regulations of our department. Let your rules and regulations go to hell which make you to behave like a wimp in a police uniform. The people who tamper with the truths, are even worse than those prostitutes, who just sell their bodies. Ajay, just listen. Where are you going? I want to follow the path where I can find Anand. Ajay, just before you leave I want to reveal something. Whatever happened inside is because of that fact that I wanted it to be so. Do you think you have done something great? You just got me to part with my clothes. Even prostitutes, are good at doing so. Both of you belong to the same mentality of people. Sir, will you like to have something hot or cold. You, shut up! Khadak singh? Ajay has already been suspended. But just like a wounded tiger he is heading towards the village and is on a look out for Anand. You will have to stop him mid-way. Assume that, it's done. Anand! - Yes brother! You should not step out of the house. Strange! This is Landlord Khadak Singh's body. Landlord? Landlord? - What's the matter? Why are creating so much noise? See this. 'Landlord, if you don't handover, Anand to the police,' 'I will keep on handing over dead bodies to you.' 'I swear by my mother.' Are we here in a cremation ground or a battle ground? Oh, my! Anand, you lit the pyre. We might keep some debts in friendship but in animosity we don't keep any debt at all. That's great. Father-in-law, you were right in not allowing the police to accompany us here. Your police has not been able to kill even a single mosquito. There is no point in getting them here. You are insulting me. Son-in-law, do something worth, where you can actually command respect. I will definitely applaud you, if you do it. You have said something which I have really not liked. DSP Mathur... - Acharya. Sir, I had asked Khadak Singh that let me send some criminals for your support. But he didn't listen at all. Its okay if did not listen. Just leave him. Just tell me. What about the one who is alive? Very soon, sir, very soon. I promise you, very soon you will get to see inspector Ajay Shastri's dead body. It should happen, otherwise I will not spare you. I got to read a proverb in my seventh standard which means, some people never change. And it goes well with you. Even after being in the police uniform you don't know what the police stands for. Let me explain. 'P' for politeness. 'O' for obedience. 'L' for loyalty. 'I' for intelligence. 'C' for courage. And 'E' for efficiency. You are neither polite nor intelligent. You are neither courageous nor loyal. So, let me make you understand all together a new meaning for police. Number one is, getting a nice beating. Second is being a crook. Another meaning of police is getting a hard kick. There still are many more meanings but you are already in a very bad shape. Forgive me. Please, forgive me, Ajay. You took away my uniform from me. Today, you will wear a uniform resounding death. Hello? - Shamsher here? Speak. - Who are you? How are you related to the DSP sir? This is his father speaking. Hello uncle. When did you return from the village? Just now... Where is DSP sir? He is sleeping. - I have a message for him. We have already taken a revenge for Khadak singh's murder. We killed Ajay's maternal uncle. And we have made all the preparations to be able to kill Ajay. You should ask DSP sir, if he has some whereabouts of Ajay. Where are you all? We are calling from burnt ruins of a house. You just be there, DSP has woke up. He will come there and give you all the details. You don't worry uncle, we won't move even an inch. Okay, give me your blessings, uncle. Why did you want the bullock cart here? He challenged us by sending Khadak Singh's body by a bullock cart. We are also going to send his body through a bullock cart, but this time time it will be dragged throughout the village. Who? What happened? They threatened everyone in the village. Look there. As one sows so he reaps. God has given justice Why haven't you prepared a pyre for these bodies? Sir, we need extra logs of wood for it. Do it, using whatever you have with you. Landlord, there is a letter in these logs. 'I once told you Landlord, if you stretch things too far' 'dead bodies will be more in count than the wood you' 'need to turn them into pyres.' 'I still give you some time, just handover Anand to me.' Father, you had suggested that I should keep someone for my protection. Have you done it? He is the one. A person who dyes the clothes is called a dyer. And a person who fills life with the colours of death is me. My name is Chengeza. Hello. Did you talk to him about the payment? He has offered me a very meagre sum. But I still want to help you. As Ajay Shatri is our common enemy. He thinks that I am dead. But I am still alive and will definitely be a cause of his death. You have chosen the right person. You will stay here till we don't lit Ajay's pyre. 'Brother?' 'Brother, the clothes you got for me' 'have been short in size' 'and these bangles too.' 'But why did you wear them?' 'At least you got a chance to laugh at me.' 'You made fun of yourself just to make us laugh?' 'You don't have to be so nice, someone might' 'cast an evil eye upon you.' Stop. He is guilty before the law. Chengezi has got to do nothing with it. Law will punish him. And if someone tries to escape from here a volley of fires will be thrown on him. I had told you that I am with you. And I rescued you from Chengezi's men. And what about Chengeza? You left him, untouched, sir. Evil is not the answer to evil. Get down. I was deliberately sent to your police station. Actually, I was of this opinion that you should be killed in a false encounter. So that I can have an extra star on my uniform. And you said that you should do something which makes your uniform feel proud to be on you. And out of the two choices, I am going to do something which actually serves my interest. You have all the sympathies of the Police force, sir. You just run away, sir. You run away. I will take care of rest of the things. Due to your guidance, sir. I am not a coward anymore. Best of luck, sir. Best of luck. You are quite aware about the rules. Do you want a job or want to wear anklets. Anklets. I think you will were them only once you are in. You should always wear anklets before entering. So that it's easy for me to identify you. What's this? Today, you are going to wear them. Inspector, you playing with the fire. Acharya! I kept running from this fire and lost everything in it. I lost my soul, my conscience, my self esteem. Everything into it. We take oaths getting to know about the integrity and the dignity of this uniform. But people like you, make us to behave like dogs. Who can bark, bite and even wag the tails on your whims. You are still going to wag your tails. Absolutely not. And I had forewarned you about it. Do you remember, one day... someone abused you... it was me. From that very day, I had been waiting for this moment, Acharya. When I would be able to force you to wear the anklets and walk wearing them. Come on wear those anklets. He has this old habit of walking wearing anklets. Come on, wear them. - Shut up. You shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Wear them. Let me do it. Hey, which song were you singing on that day. Sing. I don't know - Sing! "Wait, my beloved." Acharya learn to walk in a proper tune. "Wait, my beloved." Acharya? Anybody, who makes Acharya to dance can't be left to live. Bloody Eunuch. Now, good news of Ajay's death can come at any moment. Ajay is alive. Sister? Ajay? Laugh, come on laugh, and just keep laughing. Why are you quiet? He has this old habit of breaks news. Why don't you break the other news? Ajay is not in the police custody, anymore? He is all free. I am ruined. I will not let anything happen to you. But there are some conditions. You will have to do, whatever I say you to. Agreed, brother-in-law, Agreed. Tell me as to what should I do. But just save me. Start preparations for Annu's and my marriage. This marriage will take place, today just now and at this very place. No, no. Please don't do like that. You can't do this. Till date I have tolerated all your high handedness. I have tolerated all the excesses you made. Because... I wanted to remain attached to you. You can't separate me from yourself, like that. You can't do it. You swear by this wedding chain that you won't do anything like this. Wedding chain has a lot of power in it. Sister, today you have done the right thing by asking him to swear by this wedding chain. So that he restrains himself from committing such a sin. Otherwise, committing sins is an old age habit with him. I also heard... that wedding chain is quite powerful. Now I will put this wedding chain around your sister's neck. Yes. Annu? - Sister! Sister! Enough! - Please get some poison for me? It's better to die than to lead such a life. Sister. Don't say like that. - Move aside. No! - Come - No! Sister! - Come. Let go off her! Ajay? Ajay? Don't waste time, Ajay. Just take her away from here. Otherwise, these people will get her sacrificed here. Please take her away. No. Ajay Ajay. No. Ajay Inspector, Ajay Shastri? Don't do it, brother, Stop. He is unconscious. If he dies in this condition how will he get to understand the pain of death. So, what do you want? - He is a dead bodynow. Tomorrow, we will do everything else with him which is supposed to be done with a dead body. No, brother-in-law! No! Just pick him. Just pick him up. Keep him here. Come on, you eunuch, just pick that earthen pot. Take the dead body along the village. 'May his soul rest in peace.' Move. 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' 'May his soul rest in peace.' Why are you crying? You seem to have a lot of sympathy for him. You Eunuch. Now you will perform his last rites. Just lit the pyre. - No. You ***, you eunuch. Come on. Come on. Just walk walk properly. Walk in a proper rhythm. - Walk on the tune. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali. Hail Goddess Kali.
