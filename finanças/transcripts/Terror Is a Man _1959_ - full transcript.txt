I was here this afternoon. He wasn't here then. He's alive. Go back and get a litter. Better hurry, we still have a good deal of ground to cover. My name is Girard, I'm a doctor. We are about a thousand miles off the coast of Peru. How do you feel? I guess all right. - Any pain? - No. Good. Did your ship go down? Yeah. Pedro Queen. It was a freighter. Your name is William Fitzgerald, hm? We found a wallet in your hip pocket. It's over there on the table. You are petroleum engineer, eh? Yeah. - You were headed for the states? Yeah. Isn't there anybody? You were alone. There was an explosion. I was the only, only one up on top, I. I thought there might be other boats. No. Your lifeboat was the only one washed up on the beach. Do you have you any boats here? No. Have they radioed? We have no radio. I'm afraid there's nothing we can do. Well. You sitting up and taking notice, eh? Walter, this is William Fitzgerald. Walter Perrera, we carried you off from the beach. And did you see anything? - No, that thing's really hurting, you know it? I heard it once. Moaning, crying like. You really want that thing back? Don't be stupid, Walter. We must've woke your wife up. She's up on the porch. Well, I'll see you all in the morning. Glad you're okay, Fitzgerald. Good night. Go in there and stay with him until he finishes it. Yes, sir. I'm sorry. How long have you been up? - I think I woke up when you first brought him in. Is he all right? He will be. He was on a freighter that went down. He's an American, apparently the only survivor from what he says. - There isn't anything you can do about the others, is there? Walter said that you found him on the beach. Yes, he was quite lucky. He could have drifted into the- When? And hour ago. What were you doing out? It has escaped again, hasn't it? Going to dig pits tomorrow. I knew it, I heard it crying. It sounded like a human. There is nothing to be afraid of, dear. It's as frightened of you as you are of it. Yes, I suppose it is. It's known nothing but pain and fear since we came here. I can't help being afraid. I'm afraid of this house, this island. I can't stand Walter. What you're doing is so wrong, I hate it, all of it. I know you do. Please let the animal go. Let it escape, then we can leave here. Frances, we have spent two years working on that animal here. It would be absurd to throw that away and the dozen years before that learning, experimenting. That's important. - What about us, aren't we important? My dear, of course we are. Please don't. This is so cheap. - There's just no talking to you tonight, is there? Good night. Sir, are you feeling all right, sir? Yeah. Feeling a little bit like a human being again. I was just thinking, I'm a pretty lucky human. Yes, sir. Can I do something for you, sir? No, I'm fine, Tiago, thanks. I think that was about the finest meal I've ever had. And I thank you for the razor and the clothes. Did Dr. Girard say when he'll be back? No, sir. Flowers for your girl? They're for my mother, sir. I take them now if you don't want something. No, I'm fine, thanks. Tiago, is there anybody in the house now? No, sir. - Well, there was something about traps last night, is he hunting today? Yes sir, he's hunting. Tiago. Who lives here, Tiago? - Dr. Girard, Mrs. Girard, Mr. Walter, my sister. I mean here, on this island. What people live here? Not any, sir. - Not any? - Nobody. Hello. Hello? Anybody around? Hi, no, don't come any closer. Stay there. It's all right, I didn't want you to walk into this pit. There's a pit here. It begins about a dozen feet in front of me. It's covered with leaves and branches, do you see it? How do you feel? Pretty good. What is this, a trap? Yes, we're just about finished. Just a little over there, then you're through. Mr. Fitzgerald, this is my wife, Frances. Hello. How do you do? I'm glad you're feeling so much better. - Yes, I've been thinking about that, I'm pretty lucky. - You shouldn't be running around like this, but as long as you are here, it's all right. Can I help? No, thanks. Are there any more pits like this? Three more. Did you have anything to eat? Plenty, Tiago's a good man. I'm sorry there wasn't one of us there, but we had to get this done. It's been a very difficult day. - Is it a particular kind of animal you want? Yes, uh, we dug those pits and we put out some drugged meat. One or the other ought to do the job. It's all right, let's go. The sun will be down in an hour. I must've slept for 20 hours. That's good, you needed it. I guess I did. Feels as if I'm not awake yet. - To you, darling, for many reasons. The most immediate being our delightful supper. - I think we should be toasting Mr. Fitzgerald for reminding us we still can be civilized on vacation. - That's right, Mr. Fitzgerald is our first guest. Seems so much longer than two years. I had forgotten we had goo china or silver or the manners to use them. - I'd like to drink to destiny or the fates, or whatever it was that put me ashore here on your island. I'm gonna walk around a little. It's been two or three hours now. We might've caught us a cat by now. Yeah, I'll get that black devil back where he belongs. Ain't that right? - Yes, sir. - You can bring a coffee now, Selene, just three. This has been wonderful. I'd almost forgotten about the animal, this island. - This here's been a very pleasant evening. You've been here two years? Just about. - At first, I had the idea that you were a missionary, but the boy was telling me you've, well there's nobody else here on the island. This would be a very poor spot for missionaries. No, I am a surgeon. I'm doing some experimental work here. You must've come through the village this afternoon. Yes. Well, didn't Tiago tell you? About the village? - Well, it has been inhabited since last night. 50 or 75 people were living here. What do you mean, they all just left? Not quite so sudden or so strange. They're very superstitious people. They never quite understood what I was doing here. They thought me to be some sort of an evil spirit. We've had some trouble before. Must be a primitive bunch. Well, most people are, aren't there? Wouldn't have been much different in New York. What did they do? Nothing, they were afraid, so they decided to move to some other island. Why were they afraid? No reason really, they were just afraid. - One of the men came to get Tiago and Selene. We didn't know until later, but they wanted to stay on. They're the only ones left. Well that's fantastic. All while I was asleep. Why, we all were asleep. Is New York your home, you mentioned it. - Yes, I had my practice there in Manhattan. I gave it up two years ago. I was doing quite well, office on Park Avenue. I quit because I was making too much money. Not that objected to make money, but I had some research work I wanted to do, and the more money I made, the harder I found it to break away. I knew if I waited much longer, I'd never leave. What is it you're trying to do? To alter certain functions. It's too difficult to explain. It would be to me. Surgery's a little out of my line. You are from San Francisco. Mm, that's right. I've been in South America most of the last 10 years. I was on my way back home to stay. I didn't quite make it. It was a terrible thing. I'll be a long time forgetting. Incidentally, how often does a boat put in here? That's what I wanted to tell you. Not very often, I'm afraid, about four times a year. The last was seen a month ago, so could be another two months. Do you realize nobody in the world knows what happened to that ship or the people on it, and nobody knows what happened to me, except you. Charles. Maybe just a signal. Sounded close. I won't be long. Is it always quiet like this? Not always. - I think I'm developing a taste for quietness in my later years. I like it. - You do? I don't. Sometimes, not always. Are you afraid of something, Mrs. Girard? I'm afraid of everything. Right now, the darkness and the night. I never used to be afraid of the darkness before. But I am now. - I don't blame you, the animals here, it surprises me. What do you mean? I just wouldn't expect to find anything like a panther here, not on an island the size of this one. Do you see many of them? No. No, we brought this animal with us when we came here. Charles got it from a dealer in Kahai. It's for his work? Yes. It escaped last night. They'll probably find it, won't they? Yes, they'll find it. Then he'll want me to assist him in his work again. I don't think I can. Do you work with him? I'm a nurse. Well, I don't know, I imagine he's as anxious to get back home as you are. I'm going to leave on the next boat whether Charles's work is finished or not. I'd like to get away. Sometimes I think I'll die on this island. Will you help me, Mr. Fitzgerald? Certainly, but. Looks like they got him. - Yeah. I have to go in now. See, nothing to be afraid of now. Yes, there is. Well, we got him. He eat enough of that meat, he'll be out this time next year. - Walter, there's no reason to keep you up, you can go to bed. Frances. Frances, will you come out now? Charles, please don't. Leave him alone tonight. - There are some sterilized gowns downstairs, aren't there? Yes, there are. I'll be down. - You want to fill all them pits tomorrow, don't you? Yes, tomorrow. - All right. - You got him. Yes. Are you going to be working tonight? Yes, he's unconscious. There was more chlorohydrate in that meat that would put out an army. We have to bring him to, otherwise, he'll die. I didn't realize he'd escaped. Your wife told me you used him in your work. He is my work. - Well, I think I feel as if I've been making myself. I think I'll go to bed. Yes, you're still very weak. It will take a few more days. Dr. Girard. I know this work is important to you, and I also know that the whole things is none of my business, but- Yes, this work is very important to me. It's the most important thing in my life. I came here to do a very specific piece of work. I came to this island because it afforded me privacy. There is no one here to waste my time. I understand. Good night. No change. No. Must be the generator. Will you please go and turn it? Yes. It's more than half full. It must be something else. I cannot stop to check now. The candles must be over there in the top drawer if we need them. Let's hope we don't. Are you operating tonight? No, not tonight. You now, this is wrong. I can't help you anymore, I can't. All right. I'll have Walter come down and clean up. All right. I'm sorry. Hello. Your own private beach. Yes. Sometimes it's a little too private. How do you feel today? Fine, been exploring your island. Say, I was wondering, I just passed through the village, and I meant to ask last night about the graves there. Was one of the boys' mothers Tiago's? Yes. She was our servant. Her name was Alicia. She was killed the first time the animal escaped. She was the first one. The night before last, it escaped again. People were killed that time. That was why they left. Your husband didn't say anything about it. No. I, I guess he had his reasons. Last night you said you were afraid. You never said what you were afraid of. Is it your husband? Yes. Will you help me? I said I would. But I don't think there's anything to worry about. They're not going to let it get loose again. Must be a mean animal. It's a pitiful creature. Don't let's talk about it. - Don't you feel better today than you did last night? - I always feel better on a daylight, out in the sun. - Along the Gulf of Mexico, there's a little beach, something like this. - I was imagining this was a French Riviera before you came. Have you ever been there? - No. - It's pretty overrated. - I thought I'd love it when I first came here. Seems a long time ago, two years. I was busy making plans, and I was planning to marry a wealthy doctor, live on an island in the South Seas. Sounds better than a travel poster. I thought so then. It's been a long time, hasn't it? Please don't. I'm not lonely, I'm frightened. Won't be long. I'd hate to see them come. Remember last year? Yes. Would you like a drink? No thank you. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. - Mrs. Girard, will the doctor not be having his dinner? - No, if he wants anything, he'll get it himself, Tiago. - He hasn't been upstairs the whole day, you know it. I'll call down to him a couple of time. He said he was busy. That's all right with me. Maybe that stinkin' animal down there is gonna die. You want another one? Not yet, thanks. You gentlemen have your drinks. I think I'll say good night. - Already? - Good night. Good night, Mrs. Girard. She's kinda touchy tonight, ain't she? She's a little edgy. I guess we all are. - Yeah, yeah, everybody's touchy, are they? That's right, I hadn't thought about it. But uh, you know why that is, hm? No, why? It's the weather. That's right, that's the weather. I know what I was talking about, I was born and raised in rain country, in Guatemala, you know. Over there, when it rains, or it's gonna rain, people gonna get mean, you know? Irritated, it's the weather. Same thing here. Makes sense. Imagine scientists- - Scientists, hm! Let me tell you something, friend. I have enough science to last me the rest of my life. I work around in hospitals, in nuthouses, since I was 23 back home. And let me tell you, that Girard's worse than the rest of them put together. What do you mean? Oh well, nothin'. It's my own fault for coming down to this stinkin' island. You know, I thought I was gonna have it pretty soft down here. There it is. I'm going off to bed. I could though, I could tell you some things. A lot of them, I mean, right here. - You could, huh? - Yeah. Stinkin' rain. There's nothing to say, is there? I thought you decided that my work was none of your business. So I did. You like a fresh drink? I see you are interested in what I'm doing here. I wonder why. Just curious. I wish I weren't. Now. You'll find out anyway from Walter or Tiago or my wife. Haven't they told you what I was doing? No, they didn't. They made quite a point of not telling me. They don't approve, I'm afraid. I wish they understood, but they don't. Every man needs approval, understanding. Do you know anything about surgery, Mr. Fitzgerald, medicine? Well, a couple of years ago, I got into a fight at a bar in Caracas, and they took 12 stitches, that's about the extent of my knowledge about surgery. That's one of its functions, repairing damage to the human body, removing malignant or poorly functioning organs, transplanting tissue or bone from one part of the body to another, sometimes from one body to another. Now there's been some progress in plastic work recently, but basically, surgery has remained primitive, limited, its potential not even imagined by medical men. I can imagine it, though, and surgery's only a part of my work, a small part. You see on the desk most of it, and these are the records. Could I have it first hand? - I feel as if I were 100 years old tonight. I began thinking about this already in medical school, actually started working on it about 10 or 12 years ago, simple work at first, on smaller animals, skin and bone grafts. Later, I attempted alterations of major organs. I had incurred many failures, but there was a percentage that was successful to some degree, so I kept on trying and learning, experimenting. Try at what? - To bring about the modification of a species, but a modification to such a degree that the subject will lose the characteristics of its own species and take on those of another. Do you understand? I think so. - I don't mean surface or topographical changes, but basic modifications, do you understand? - Well, on the face of it, it seems unnatural. Is that what the others say? Yes, that's what they say. It's no more unnatural than evolution, it is evolution. - And you've speeded up the process, is that it? You make it sound very simple, it isn't. There's more to it than surgery. That's what you said. You see, surgery can alter appearance, it can change a rat into a rabbit, but the real difference lies in the brain. Its size and the function of the individual areas. There is where the change has to be made. - You can change the size of a brain, cause it to enlarge? More than that. Enlarge and actually alter the cellular structure by the use of certain chemical, I developed it, it's a synthetic, it's similar to a glandular extract. Now, infinitesimal amounts of this chemical injected directly into the brain during surgery will bring about alteration of individual cells, cell division, and cell growth. I can control the size of the brain. I can control the function of the various areas. What do you think? - I think you've given me something to think about. - I can alter living matter, alter it basically from its smallest unit to its largest, from one cell to many trillion. - And that's what the animal out there is for. Yes, we can talk some more tomorrow. I still have a great deal of work to do tonight. All right, good night. Dr. Girard, the changes in evolution have come about through a process of natural selection haven't they? Yes. But in your work, the selection isn't nature's though, it's yours. Your choice. Yeah, that's right. Uh, I'm going to operate tomorrow. Would you like to come downstairs? Yes, I would. - Mr. Fitzgerald, please do not take what my wife says too seriously. She is afraid, and she doesn't know what she's afraid of. Rain keeping you awake? Yes. Me, too. Still, there is nothing to be afraid of. Be still. Thank you, Tiago. Yes. Sir? - Hm? I was wanting to ask you. Will you carry these with you, in your pocket? Why sure, Tiago. What is this? Aku-aku. - Good morning. - Good morning. It's hard to believe it rained last night, isn't it? Yes, it is. - Would you want some orange juice now, ma'am. Yes, please. Good morning, how are you feeling? I could say that you're not to blame for what happened last night. - I don't want to talk about it now. - If I thought it was something to be ashamed of- Please don't say anything. Talking just makes it worse. We'll have to face it sooner or later. I don't want to talk about it now. - Good morning. - Morning. Good morning. Just coffee, Tiago, where's Walter? - Walter had quite a bit of sleeping medicine last night. Not too much, I hope. I need him to assist me this morning. - Are you operating this morning? Yes. Say, what is aku-aku? - I see you must have been talking to Taigo, huh? Yes, he gave me this. - Yes, that's an aku-aku, it's a sort of good luck charm. All the natives here believe in it. Tiago must think you'll need a little bit of good luck, huh? Who doesn't? That's right. Mr. Fitzgerald and I had a talk last night. I tried to explain to him what we are doing here. What you are doing, Charles. See, my wife does not approve. You still feel like coming along? - Sure, right now? - Yes. You won't be bothered by his crying for a while, I'll be going to his larynx. He'll have no voice? Only just for a few hours. You won't change your mind? No. Well, I'm going to wake Walter. Tiago, maybe get him some breakfast. Shall we start? - Hm. You will find it odd to find here in the middle of a jungle a complete laboratory, surgical equipment, even have our own generator, and x-ray machine. The animal is in here. You'll be all right for a while. You will have to help me to get him onto a table. You take the legs. Dead weight, a lot of it. Secure the hand straps, will you? You operating right now? Yes, as soon as Walter comes down. You want to stay? Yes, I'd like to. I'm glad you're here. Later, whether you approve or not, at least you'll believe what you see. Oh Walter, get yourself cleaned up. If you'd be so kind to lift this, use the knob. See, it's always hard to believe great changes unless you've seen all the steps. At least you have seen one of them. - You said great changes, what did you mean? What kind of changes? Some people would call them miracles. Would you? Yes, do you believe in miracles? I don't know. I've been around a little, I haven't seen one yet. - Yes, you are young and you have been around. You think you know enough of the world to speculate on its past or its future. I don't. I still believe in miracles. Walter. I've performed exactly 53 major operations on him in the last two years. Dr. Girard. This animal- Yes, he's terribly strong. It's ironic that such a little brute should fear me, but he does. I think you better get out. I'll wait upstairs. Hi, Tiago. You were down for a long time, sir. Hm, didn't realize it was that late. Yes, sir. Five past noon. You have aku-aku? Mm-hm, here we are. You will need it, sir. Yeah, I might at that. Just finished, Frances, could I talk to you for a minute? I have to help him clean up. You have any trouble? No. - I'll stay here, you can go upstairs and rest. - I thought you didn't want to come down here anymore. So did I, but I'm here. Will you help Mrs. Girard to clean up? Frances, you check his heart every few minutes, huh? I'll be back in about an hour. All right. I wouldn't get that close, Mrs. Girard. It's got bit loose once before. We got him strapped down now. Just the same, it's no sense letting him get started again. I don't think he'll hurt me. Suit yourself. I'm glad you came down here, Mrs. Girard. I've been wanting to talk to you about something. What? Well, I wanted to talk about you. What do you mean? Just to talk. What do you want, Walter? I don't want anything. I sure don't want you to get sore at me. I want to help you. I don't need any help. And if you don't leave, I'm going to call Dr. Girard. - Oh come on, you're not going to call him. That's why I didn't want to talk to you earlier. Any place public, you know. Like, at the beach. I really don't blame you none. After all, it's none of my business. But you are wrong about not needing any help. You do, because let me tell you, that husband of yours is crazy. You counting on getting the next boat off this island. He just might not let you, you know that? That Fitzgerald, he ain't gonna help you. He's helping your husband. You need somebody on your side. I really want to help you. If you will let me. Stay away from me, Walter. Let go of me! You devil. Got your boyfriend a little upset. You stop that. - I want you to forget about this now, Walter. But don't come close to me again! Devil being, it's time somebody took you down a peg or two! Hi. Hi, Selene. The doctor up from his nap yet? He was asleep when I left. - Yes, sir. - Thanks. - Mr. Fitz. - Yes, Selene? You, and doctor leave? Well, I did wanna see him, why? Mr. Fitz, Mrs. Doctor is a good woman. You help her to go away, please. My brother and I go with you. Only you can help, Mr. Fitz. I'll do what I can Selene, I promise. But I thought you and Tiago wanted to stay here. Our home is here, but no more. Nothing now belongs here. Only dead. - That's a bad bruise, Selene, where'd you get that? It's nothing. Who did that to you, Selene? No one. Perrera? No. Ah, there you are, Fitzgerald. I see it hasn't rained all afternoon. You've been exploring the island? Not really, just walking, thinking. Come into my study, I have something to show you that might interest you. Another hot day, eh? Come in, Mr. Fitzgerald, sit down. This is what I wanted to show you. It should make your perspective about my work fairly complete. Dr. Girard, what kind of animal is that you have downstairs, what do you call it? What would you call it? - I don't know, I've been thinking about that. Ever since I saw the eyes, all I saw was the eyes, but- And what would you call it? A man. Am I wrong? What is a man, Mr. Fitzgerald? Where does the species begin? - I saw his eyes, and there was a soul there. I call him a man. Well, if he's a man, if he has a soul, I gave it to him, didn't I? I don't think you have the right to. - Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm a scientist, not a philosopher. I cannot possibly concern myself with the moral aspects of my work. There will be enough people who will be only too eager and willing to take care of that when the time comes. Why do you want to do this, do you know? Certainly I know, I'm perfectly sane. I never thought anything else, but I'm still curious to know why. Well. Man breeds animals for his own purpose. Improves them, modifies them, he speeds up the processes of natural evolution. Now, you could ask why not use the same principle to improve the human race? Well, it cannot be done, 'cause man's mind is not his own. It' completely dominated by complexes, anxieties, fear and prejudice of countless generations before him. That's why I've chosen the animal to be the father of a new race of man. He alone will have a new, fresh mind capable of thinking his own thoughts with complete objectivity. I've never known such a man, have you? - Maybe some day, such a man will evolve, evolve naturally. There are laws, natural laws. Yes, but why wait? We can only find out about these natural laws by waiting, watching, and recording them over hundreds, thousands of years and generations. What a waste of time. Let me show you something, Mr. Fitzgerald. Here, this is a photograph of the animal when we first brought it here. Here, our sketches showing the various stages of development. This is evolution, Mr. Fitzgerald. Man evolved from an animal in less than two years, according to natural law, it cannot be done. Well, I have done it. Have you? In appearance, perhaps, but inside, he's still a beast, a killer. Semantics. This creature killed by instinct, out of fear. Same instinct of fear makes people kill each other, go to war. That instinct, I'm afraid, I have not yet been able to isolate and remove with a scalpel. - In the meantime, he's killed four people without reason. - How childish and naive and sentimental you are. What do the lives of four people- - You mean you don't care about the lives of these people? - I care as little about theirs as I do about my own. Well, that's your business, but you don't have the right to involve your wife in all this. - Mr. Fitzgerald, why should any man value another more than he does himself? That's your philosophy. Isn't it yours? Be honest with yourself. It takes courage, I know. Well, I have it, and that is why nothing, absolutely nothing will stop me or alter my course. So what is your course from here? I shall continue my work, and I shall succeed in creating a higher, a perfect man. He's entering another life. Can you imagine what he feels, what he thinks? Does he think? Yes. Man. Man. Man. Man. Good. Good, man. Good. Yes, yes. Yes. He is a man. Charles, is he afraid of something? I don't think so. I don't know. I could use this. I wish I knew what was wrong. No pain. There is no pain. It may have something to do with you. Why don't you wait outside. Don't be afraid. Nothing is going to happen to you. There's nothing to fear. Don't be afraid. What do you want me to do, sir? Get Walter down here with the torch. What about you? Go on. Get a torch, he needs you down there. Tiago's gone after it. Well how good that will do. The gun was there. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. What about Charles? He's okay, Tiago! Are you out of your minds? You'll get us all killed! - He'll be afraid of this sir, do you have a match? Yeah. I'll stop him! Walter. Careful, Walter. Please don't hurt him. You, too! Somebody help me with this, quick! He's badly hurt. I'll give him a sedative. That devil tore up the whole place down there. Don't that matter any? No. The damage can be repaired, it doesn't matter. Besides, we have other drug supplies. - Why, you should've let me finish him off myself. He's a killer to start with. - I don't want to hear any more of that. He's no more of an animal than you are. Then he is a man. Is he, Charles? Yes, he is. You call that thing a man? Charles, we have got to get out of here. Let's talk about it later. There's no need to talk about it later. We have no secrets here, any of us. We live too closely for that. Yeah. - Please, let's leave as soon as possible. I can't. Then I've got to go by myself. - I know what a strain this has been on you, Frances, but you are still my wife. Am I? What exactly does that mean to you? I told you how I felt about my work before we were married. I never said that living with me would be one endless romantic adventure. Oh Charles, I'm so sick of this. I'm not trying to put the blame on anyone, I don't care who's to blame. All I know is that I can't live here any longer. I don't even know you. You don't know me? Whom do you know, yourself? Fitzgerald, perhaps? What do you want me to say, Charles? There is nothing to say. We both know how things stand. Do we? I supposed you're the injured party, the innocent and misunderstood husband. Frances, why are we so hostile? You'll just never understand that whatever I've done here is not for myself, but for humanity. Did it ever occur to you to ask me if I thought it was worth it? You'll leave with me when I'm ready. You'd better accept that as final. - I'm not like that poor creature downstairs, Charles. You didn't create me. He's going back to the lab. He's gone clean out of his mind, calling that thing a man. Expect we'll have to do something. - Like what? - Like! Somebody's got to stop him. He'll get us all killed. What he is doing, that ain't right, and you know it. You act like you want him to keep on. What's the matter with you, anyway? I think you're as crazy as he is! Do you think Charles is insane? He may be a genius, he's not insane. There's a fine line. Does somebody got to stop him. - You're not the one, though, Walter, even if you're right. - I don't know what he's fixing to do down there, but I think we ought to do something. What are you gonna do Walter, get drunk? You don't talk to me like that, mister. Oh, please be quiet, Walter. You two are pretty smart, aren't you? He don't know how smart, does he? Get up. Stay there! I'm going down there. I'll have a little talk with you later, mister. Take it easy, Walter. - Yeah, take it easy, that thing gets loose again, kill all of us! - Don't be stupid! - I'm not stupid, mister! I'm not stupid. Girard! You fool. Get back, go on. I'm going to do some operating on him. Walter, I am warning you. Get back! You calling me a fool, I'll show you the fool! What's that? The generator. You better do something about it, there's not time to lose the lights. - Downstairs. - Okay. Where's some candles? In my room. You find it? No, it should be somewhere downstairs, I thought they were here. Oh, here it is. This thing's dead. Do you have any matches, a lighter? No, not in here. It's all right, Frances. Nothing to be afraid of now. We're getting away from here together. I'll tell him tonight. I have to leave by myself, I've got to. - But I love you, Frances, don't you know that? I don't know anything. Maybe some people can accept mistakes and make the best of them, not me. I loved him a long time. I can't just forget that. Please leave me alone. He's still there, in the hall. You still hear him? No. - He's here? - Yes, Tiago. - You both all right? - Yes. Yeah. Walter is dead. - You wanna go after him tonight? He hasn't been gone long. If he's close, he might find him even in the dark. Tiago, get the slickers out of the big closet. Bring the flashlights and the two coils of rope from the dock. But how are we going to stop him, how? I don't know. - Gotta be crazy to try and look for him in the night. If I were you, I'd wait till morning. But you are not me. Why don't you, instead of hindering me, help me, Mr. Fitzgerald. That's what I would do if I were you. All right. If we find him, how do we take him? I don't know, exactly. I'll get the hypodermic kit. Mister. I'll take this one- - Oh no, you stay here, you stay with the women. Yes, sir. You have a gun? Yes, but we won't need it. We'll be back before long. Yes. - Make sure the windows are locked, all of them. The back door, everything, all the way around. You take the rooms, Selene. Yes, ma'am. Tiago? Tiago! Tiago! Selene? Where are you? Tiago? Tiago? Selena, Tiago? She's dead! Frances! Frances! Frances, Frances! Look in all the rooms, I'll go downstairs. Frances! Fitzgerald. - It came back while we were gone. It must've gone out the back way. We've got to find him. We have to find her, Doctor. Must've been him. This goes down the cliff. You take this way. We only have one gun between us. I won't need this, neither will you. He'll do whatever I tell him to do. Put her down. There is nothing to be afraid of. Don't be afraid. Put her down! Put her down! Come here, come, come here. Leave him alone, Charles. Keep away from him! Come. Come? Tiago! Are you all right? Where's the boat? It's gone, sir. He wanted to help me. The sun'll be up soon.
