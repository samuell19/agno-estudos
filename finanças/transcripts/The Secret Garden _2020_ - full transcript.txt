Ayah, we're leaving now. Ayah! - Bring the car round! Please! - Yes, sir. - Jemima? - Ayah. Get the suitcase! Can you sleep? Now! Are you scared? Don't be. Shall I tell you a story? There were once two people called Rama... and Sita. And they loved each other. They spent their days dancing and singing together. Grrr! And then Sita was kidnapped by the evil demon Ravana. Grrr! Ayah? Ayah? Ayah! Father? Daddy? Time for our nap, Jemima. There were once two people called Mary and Jemima. They spent their days telling stories to each other. And then one day, their mother and father were kidnapped by the evil demon Ravana... ...leaving them all alone. As I understand it, her mother was struck down with cholera very suddenly. Her father rushed her mother to hospital. She died that night, her father the following morning. She can't stay here. Well, she has an uncle in England. We'll send her back with the other children. It's disgusting. Then you're gonna be very hungry. I never said you could do that. You didn't say I couldn't. If you weren't eating it, I will. You don't understand. I need better food than this. My parents are dead. We've all lost, girl. Would you like to hear a story? No. I'm not a kid. There once was a lord of the seas. His name was Varuna, and... he... I'm not a kid. You are a plain little piece of goods, aren't you? Don't expect luxury. Misselthwaite is not the place it was. Those army savages used it as a hospital in the war, left it a wreck. Don't you care? Does it matter if I care or not? You are an odd duck, aren't you? Is that the sea? No, it's the moors. Nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep. And there you have it. That's home. That's Misselthwaite. And don't expect him to come running, your uncle. He's had better days. And you're not to stare when you see what afflicts him. First things first, we are fully electric. That doesn't mean the electric always works. So, if you're needing the lavatory in the night, you take a lamp. Secondly, Mr. Craven is a widower and on his own. He's promised he'll have someone to tend to you soon enough. But until then, don't be expecting there'll be people to talk to, 'cause there won't. I need no entertaining. I'm not a child. Hmm. You'll be told what rooms you can go into, and what rooms you're to keep out of. But until then, you stick to your rooms and your rooms only. No exploring, no poking about. I assure you, Mrs. Medlock, I've no interest in "poking about." Hmm! Mother? I'm climbing. Mother, look. Please! Hello? Is anybody there? Hello? Is someone there? No, sir. Please, leave those. The army will come and collect them. Come on. Come inside. Who are you? What's that for a greeting? You'll call me Martha. And you're Mary, I hear. Brrr! Quite chilly today, but spring is on its way. That's what my brother Dickon says. He's always out on the moor. I was cold in the night and no one heard my call. I'm guessing we were sleeping too. And I heard noises. Wailing. Screaming. No, you heard the wind, that's all. My Ayah would come if I needed her. Whoever Ayah is, she's sure as not here, is she? But aren't you going to be my servant? I'm just to check the fire's lit, the room's shipshape and you've had food in you. Come on, get up and ready. Your porridge is getting cold. I don't eat porridge. For my breakfast, I like bacon and eggs. I like 'em too. But you've got porridge. Now, eat. But you need to dress me. Dress you? Do you not know how? Me mother always says she can't see why grand people's children didn't turn out to be fools, what with being washed and dressed and took out to walk as if they were puppies. And there I was, excited to have a young 'un in the house. It doesn't matter! This is of no importance. We can't just leave them all piled up like this. Well, get rid of them! Throw them away. Burn them. I don't care! The house will be better without them! What about this one? Please, I don't need to be reminded of her. She's gone. One, two... Thirty-one... Fifty-seven, fifty-eight... Seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight... Hello? Are you Martha's brother? Come back! No! There you are. Now you're fed. You can go now. Don't you dare. It's far too close! I want you to go! Of all the silly things. Are you following me? Mary! Mary? Do you have a problem with wild dogs on this manor? It is not a manor, it is an estate. Of course we don't have a problem with wild dogs. You're not in the colonies now. And in future, your bath will be ready at 5:25, and you'll be expected to be in your room by then. Ayah, please keep her quiet! Were you here when the soldiers were? Did you work in the hospital? Soldiers died here, didn't they? Please don't. You spoil the carpet and your dress and it'll be me has to clean both. The noises that I hear in the night, do dead soldiers haunt this house? If you hear noise, then turn over and sleep more. I didn't ask to be here! And Mr. Craven didn't ask to take you in, but he did all the same. Mrs. Pitcher? You gave me a sandwich yesterday, for my luncheon. I need the same meat in my sandwich today. Please? There you are. Hello. What's your name, then? Are you a girl dog or a boy dog? I think that you're a girl dog and I'm going to call you Jemima. Come on, Jemima! Wait for me! Where are you taking me? Jemima! So this is where you live. Mary! - I'll see you tomorrow. - Mary! I saw you. I can't say I saw enough to identify you, but I'm sure if I were to say the little servant girl, you'd be in firm trouble, wouldn't you? I'm no servant. My name is Mary Lennox. My mother was sister to the mistress of this house and my uncle owns it still, and you'll do well to give me the respect I'm due. I'll give you none. I'm Colin Craven and the uncle you speak of is my father. If I were to live, this place should belong to me. We're cousins. But I've never heard of you. Nor I of you. You're very thin. You're very white. You smile with no teeth. Well, you don't smile at all. Why are you here? Why shouldn't I be? I don't want a friend. I've plenty already. So you're the one that cries at night. I thought this cursed house was magic... You think the house cursed? By all the soldiers that died here. No. The curse came before the war. The reason they say this house is cursed is because it killed my mother and tried to kill me. My mother's dead too. And I killed her. Did you really? Well, then we both know tragedy... don't we? Daddy! Wake up, girl. The master wants to see you. Come on, girl, you can help more than you are. My mother would say you do as little as fast as you can. I have decided that I like your mother. You've never met her. Eat. I like your brother Dickon too, and I have met him. Well, I would have, but he backed away. I've seen him, at least. Dickon has problems enough of his own without you to bother him. Don't worry, he won't like me. No one does. And how do you like yourself? Mother said that to me once. Put her in a bad temper and she turns on me and she says, "There tha' stands saying tha' doesn't like this one an' tha'. How does tha' like thysel'?" Not that I want to interrupt this reminisce, but there are those who are waiting on us. Mrs. Medlock, I'm sorry... It's not her fault. I was tardy. She was scolding me for it. Well, it doesn't matter whose fault it is. What matters is you're late. Now, come on with you. Now, when he speaks to you, you answer back with a "sir." Do you understand? Yes, Mrs. Medlock. And if he wants to look at you, you let him look, but don't stare back. And say nothing fanciful. He's enough concerns. Come here, girl. Into the light, where I can see you. Mrs. Medlock says you're cluttering up the place. She'd have me send you away to school. I don't want that, sir. I like it here. Then we will find you a governess. No. I've no need of a governess. I've too much to learn here at Misselthwaite, sir. This place has nothing to teach you. I want to play out of doors. It was too hot to do so in India. I'm obliged by law to have you taught. Then we'll need to break the law, won't we? Mrs. Medlock says she sees your mother in you. I'm not so sure. Did she like my mother? Doesn't seem to like me. It's not your mother I see. You see her twin. Your wife. My mother said the same once. If you do cause me trouble, I will have you sent away to school in an instant. Do you understand? All women are destined to leave Misselthwaite, one way or another. Go on, off you go. I'm not to be sent to school and I'm not to have a governess. - Are you not? - Mr. Craven's orders. He doesn't want me to leave this cursed house like all the other womenfolk. Please be sure to have Mrs. Pitcher supply me with her special sandwiches. Extra meat. It is a requirement. I need to grow. Hello. Jemima! Jemima! Jemima. No. Please don't. No! Jemima? Jemima? Jemima! Hello. This is a mysterious place. Come back and we'll get that wound better for you. The trap wasn't my fault. Very well. Can I see your paw, Jemima? I promise I won't hurt you. You don't want help? That's fine. We'll deal with that later. We'll have an explore first. Keep up, Jemima. There were once two friends called Mary and Jemima, and they discovered a mysterious garden. Hello to you too. No, don't hurt him. It's just a friendly robin. What is it? That's as good an idea as you've had. Mary! I'll be back tomorrow to see to that leg. Mary! Mary! But... you've dirt all over you, and your hair's matted and wet. Mr. Craven said to play. I'm playing. Colin... No! Lie still. No, please. I don't like it. It tastes horrid, please! I know you don't like it, but it's going to make you well. - Please. Please! - You know very well, it's either the medicine or the brace. Come on. It'll soon be over. Just... Please! I don't like it. It tastes horrid. I don't like it. I'll come back later when you've calmed down. Sometimes I need to be restrained, or medicated. My father says it's for my own benefit. Although I rarely see him. He's always too busy. I thought you wouldn't visit again. That's your chair? It's none of your business! Don't touch it! Oh, it's good. Moves well. Do you use it much? I'm afraid I can't. You've seen my father's hunchback. Well, mine is worse. I've never been able to walk. Shall we use the chair to explore? I can push... Your cousin is dying. You don't look like someone who's dying. And how many dying people have you seen? We could go outside and, who knows, you might feel better. Once they tried to take me outside, and the stench of the roses almost killed me. You're afraid of flowers? That isn't very sensible. What if I were to tell you that I know of a magical place? Where the birds sing for you and a friendly dog plays with you? I'd say that you were lying. And I'm not interested, even if you are telling the truth. But... I'm tired now. You can go. What? I'm tired. You're not listening to me. Please leave. I'm not your play toy to be put down when you choose! You came to me. I never invited you in. I told you secrets about my magic place. Secrets I didn't care to know of. Now get off my bed and leave me alone. Is that your mother? You were leaving. They say I look like her. I hate her for doing it. Dying. Hate her? My mother loved me hugely. Everyone said so. And then she died, leaving me all alone. It's unforgivable. Well, my mother never loved me. Will you read to me? As I try to fall asleep? I struggle to sleep. I know... I'll tell you a story about gods and a quarrel over who first made fire. That sounds terrible. Read me this. What are you laughing about? You might be the rudest boy I've ever met. Perfectly all right. But you've not eaten anything. Please don't fuss! Martha, can you tell me about my Aunt Grace? Your mother didn't talk of her sister at all? She never talked of England. Thick as thieves, they were. The crying I heard when it was announced your father was to be posted to India. I served at the last ball they had here. To see them dance... This house was filled with light, laughter, happiness. Your poor mother. I don't know how she coped to lose her. I don't think she ever recovered. Mummy, I have a new story for you. No, darling, I just need to be alone. - Mommy! - Please go away! Come on, Miss. Mother! Mary! Mary, please, darling, leave your mother in peace. Why won't she see me? What's wrong with me? She's just sick, that's all. Then why doesn't she get on and die, leave us all alone? You needn't trouble with dressing me this morning. I can manage. Jemima? Jemima! Dickon? Stop! I know it's you, Dickon. And unless you want me to instruct your sister to box your ears... My sister loves me much more than you. She won't love you so much when she knows you're poaching on the moor. Poaching? I were not. You ran from me. That says guilt. Guilt for what you did to my Jemima. I'm not sure your dog would like the name Jemima, being as he's a boy. A boy? It doesn't matter. His paw was trapped in a horror trap. Tell me where I'd find him. Why should I trust you? I know how to make him better. Trust that. I need you to keep a secret. On my honor I'll keep it. Why have you just spat on yourself? You spit too. Then we shake. Then we're bonded. If you're too much of a lady, then there's no... I'm no lady, sir. And it's my secret, so you're to keep it. You're just here to help with the dog. Wow. This way! Can you do this? Look at this. Hello, fella. How'd you get here? Master not come back from the war? Do you think he lost his home? I'll do you no harm. Hey... What are you doing? You tricked me. Hold the head. This was all a trick! If we don't see to this now, he'll lose his leg, and chances are, his life. Careful, now. He trusts you. Nothing's broken, but it looks like it's going rotten. Is there running water here? That's really good, that. Feel better, does it, sir? Up. Dickon, you haven't fixed anything. You've made it worse. Just give it time. Both of you. We've done all we can. We're hoping the garden will magic him well? Come morning, we'll have an answer. It has a lake? You wouldn't call it a lake, but a pond maybe, and a stream. Now, promise to spit? You may need to educate me on how to spit. Surprisingly simple. I've spit and I won't tell a soul. Now, tell me everything about your dog. Does he love the garden? Is he trained? In fact, I've a book on dog training. It's on that chair over there. Fetch it. When was the last time you used your chair? Fetch me my book... I don't believe your back is half as bad as you make out. And I know you didn't kill your mother. So who is the bigger liar? Did you ask after me? I said I'd heard you. They said you'd lost both your parents tragically. They were very clear you weren't a murderess. Do you trust me? I've something to show you. Why would I trust you? You'll damage my back. I wished her death, and it happened. I'm absolutely her murderer. Okay, fine. I believe you. But if you take me to that garden, you'll murder me too. Of course I'm not taking you into the garden. There's something you need to see. I was three years old when your mother died, and you and I are almost the same age. Was this my mother's room? No. No, take me back! You should see these. No, don't be scared. You'll like them. Your mother. My mother. She came. Don't you see? I don't want to see. To Misselthwaite, to visit your mother. She wanted to see her before she died. And look. No, I don't want to look! Can you see? They're inside the secret garden. Don't be afraid. Look. - And we're there too. - No! I've been to Misselthwaite before. So we did know of each other. Isn't that extraordinary? And do you know what's even more extraordinary? You're walking. How dare you! This is just jealousy because my mother loved me. Well, you don't deserve a mother's love! Colin? Are you okay? Where does it hurt? You don't even have a hunchback. Of course I do. Your back's just the same as mine. I swear on your mother's life, I can't see it there at all. Come on, let's get you up. Careful. You tell me to be careful? Have you seen him? He's better! He still has a limp, but the leg takes his weight. The garden has cured him. It had some help. No, Dickon. This is a magic garden. What are you doing? I'm a Yorkshire terrier. Then I'm a Yorkshire terrier too. Ruff! Mary! The robin's helped us find a gate. It's locked. Not for long. Who's there? It's the girl, isn't it? My name's Mary, and you know it. I don't want you here! I don't want to see you. You're cruel! We're past this, Colin. You'll scream. I'll scream. No good will come of it. They catch you in here, they'll have you whipped. It's worth the risk. You risk being sent to school. We risk far more. Don't worry yourself, Mrs. Medlock. I'll deal with him. Never normally causes bother at this hour. I'll take care of it, Mrs. Medlock. You continue with your chores. Such a lot to do. Do that and you'll never see me again. It's your decision. This is Dickon. Hello. He's handsome. And he can whistle. When's the next time they'll check on him? I'll bring him his lunch, then come back a little after 4:00 to check he's eaten. I'm not going! You know what you risk? He'll be back in his room by 4:00. I'm not going! When we tried to fix the dog, he refused us too. Take his legs, Dickon. I'll take the arms. Or... we can get you in the chair, get you down safely. I promise you we won't kill you. You can't promise anything of the kind! You'll die in this bed, and all you'll have seen is the wallpaper. Is that really what you want? Where's Dickon? You're going too fast. You're too fast! Stop that! It's the pollen, I told you. Take a breath. Still alive? Yes, but... We'll work out what hurts and what doesn't. But you have to try, just as I do. Does that sound fair? Good. Mary, the wall. Stop! The wall! Dickon, what are those called? Hydrangea. Hydrangea. And those? - Hypericum. - Hypericum. They sound better in your accent. Colin, there's a good friend I'd like you to meet. Hold it out and he'll come. He's here? The dog? Just hold it out. He wants to say hello. I can see. - He took it from my hand. - He did. - And now he's licking my hand. - He does that. It tickles. He's not diseased? Not that we've seen. What's his name? He was called Jemima. Till she knew different. Now he's... Dog. He needs a better name than that. Perhaps we should... What's your father called? Marcus. Can we not name him after him? We should not name him after my father either. My father was called Hector, and he was a brave man. Was? Settled. Hector. Mary and Dickon you know already. Well, I'm Colin, and I'm your new friend. Oh! You think you just can sneak about and act how you like, don't you? Little savage girl. I knew you were hiding something. You and your secret ways and your... deviance. Mrs. Medlock, whatever you think I've been doing, I promise... Thieving. That the sort of barbarous behavior you learnt out there, is it? Where did you find them? Underneath a floorboard. Where are you taking me? You understand these pearls mean something to me? I'm sorry. She's been everywhere. To the boy too. His wheelchair was skew-whiff when I went in this morning. It's this roused my suspicions. She's found my son too? Have we just given her the full run of the house? I warned you what a young girl could do. Was it not explained to you to stay away from the parts of the house that were not yours to roam in? Colin is my friend. I just thought that if I could excite him about life... Your excitement could kill him. Do you think he wants that? Oh, what have you done? Mrs. Medlock, let's look into finding a school for my niece. Please. I was trying to make things better. Find somewhere to educate some civility into her. You locked me in! If you'll be needing the lavatory in the night, you'll find we've provided you with a chamber pot. It's under the bed. Martha will let you out in the morning. Hey! Where are you going, girl? Mary! Follow me! Mary, what's wrong? There are even more secrets to this garden! So Colin's mother was dying? Yes. And you think she came here? My mother came to be with her in the last days of Grace's illness, knowing that she wanted to die by this tree. After which, Mr. Craven... He shut the garden away because memories of her caused too much pain. We don't have long. They're sending me to school. No? This is Grace's garden, and it needs to cure her son. It's cold. It's very, very cold. I don't think I can. Course you can. I don't think I can. We've got you. I suppose it's not so freezing. That's the way. I've done it. I've done it! Now hold your arms out and lie back. And now... you're on your own. Done. Over there, please. What are you laughing about? Just enjoying your happiness. We're all happy, aren't we? We are pirates. We're lords. We're conquerors of this fair and beautiful land. This is our garden and we love it. No. It's not our garden, and it never can be. There's something I have to show you. Stop. Stop! You know what happened here, then? Why would you bring me here? Because you needed to see it. Would you like to see the place your mother died? My mother died in a hospital, alone and in pain. Your mother found a far better spot. Dickon, can you fetch me some flowers? The white ones. And then can you take me home? I don't want to be here. You don't understand. She died here because it was beautiful, and so she made this place magical. It cured Hector's leg, and I... I didn't want to see the dresses and I don't want to see this. Please, take me home. Oof! Hello, monkey. Is something troubling you? Your mother... is sad at the moment. Her sadness has made her unwell. It's not her fault. I'm sorry. I didn't understand. Not today! Colin, I've found these letters from my mother to your mother. I don't want you today! All about you. And I don't want that garden! You need to hear this. They talk about how your father is focusing all his fears about your mother's illness onto you. How he seems set on protecting you from the world. And she's scared... of the damage he'll do to you when she's gone. Should you be... I need to read those letters. You walked. Listen to this. "She's bold, slightly dangerous, and she has a spirit that nothing can quench. I'd be scared for her if I wasn't so proud of her." Who's bold? She loved you, Mary. She wanted me nowhere near her. Maybe that's... "I'm so pleased Colin is making you laugh so. A whole day pretending to be a dog. What a delight." A dog, was it? "Archie sounds deeper in love than I've ever heard a man. He's just as besotted as I am with Mary." My father wants me locked in a room. That's the thing, isn't it? Loss changes people. Even your mother, Mary. You don't know my mother. But I know what it means to lose someone. Listen to this one, Mary. "She did a puppet show for me the night before last. An elaborate affair that required Ayah to make some silk curtains. She told this Indian myth story. It was quite mesmerizing." I hadn't read that. She wrote about my plays? Maybe he's right. Maybe neither of us knew our parents well. No. She couldn't have loved me. These letters say otherwise. Mary! Mary? We've quite the surprise for you. Just had word today, and what exciting word it is. It is a school that is full of the right sort of people and the right sort of discipline. Now, the car will take you at 3:30. We've already packed what possessions you have into your trunk. Tomorrow? Hmm. I'm not ready. Uncle? Please, Uncle! No, you don't! Why do you say your son has a hump? - What are you talking about now? - Colin. Stop with your talking. Or this will get much worse. He thinks he has a hump, but he doesn't, and I think you know it. I'm sorry, sir. Do you honestly think Grace would've wanted this life for you? You know nothing of my wife. I know she wouldn't just stand outside his door while he cries at night. Can't you see what you're doing to him? Colin needs to live, and this house is a prison for you both. I'm sorry, sir. She leaves tomorrow. Good. I can hide in the garden and be happy. At school? I can't. We don't want you to go either. He's right. We don't. But you can't stay locked up in the garden forever. Life needs living. Yeah, says the boy who's seen none of it. Says the girl so determined no one loves her, she'll make it so. They won't like me like you do. I'll go back to being alone. That smoke... is that normal? No. Father? Father! Go! Go! Mary! Get away! Who's inside? Mr. Craven. We don't know where. I know where he'll be! The brigade has been called! Mary! No, girl. No! Come back, girl! Mr. Craven! Colin? Colin! Mr. Craven! Where is my son? Where are you? Please... Mr. Craven! I don't understand. I knew you'd be here. - I'm not going. - I can't go. Mr. Craven, you need to come with me. I will not leave without my son. Your son is not here, sir, but he is safe and well. I can't desert him. Not again. I left your son not five minutes ago. I give you my word on the soul of Grace Craven. Come on! No. I can't lift you. I can't. Just leave me. Please. Don't. Please, leave me here. He needs you! Your son needs you! I've ruined everything. Come on! We're going! Mr. Craven, I need your help. Mother? Mother. Please stay. I know you can't, but please stay. Mary! Mary. Are you all right? Him. Take him first. Show me... Show me my son! It's beautiful. And it's ours. It was hers, but now I think she'd want us to share in it. And he's here? Where is my son? Call for him, sir. Colin? Colin! Father? Colin. Father, I'm here! Colin? Father? I thought I'd lost you. Of all the places. No. Wait. Please. One, two... But how is this... Magic. Secrets. Her. Her? His mother. How is it that we're taught by our children? How is that? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Enough of that. Now, tell me... Do you like our garden? We have the large French windows overlooking the patio... There were once three people who loved each other very much. Four. Are you including Hector? Maybe I was including Hector and not including you. Five. I want to include my father. - Martha needs to be included. - Six. And Martha. There were once some people who lived in an old, deserted house. Partially deserted. And they discovered a garden. One of the people discovered a garden and they didn't know it at first - but the garden was a magic garden. - It was. Because it was a magic garden it was going to save them as much as they were going to save it. I think you should talk more about Hector. If you don't both pipe down, I shan't tell the story at all! - Sorry, Mary. - Sorry, Mary. Thank you. Now if you're ready and silent, I shall try again... Ohh!
