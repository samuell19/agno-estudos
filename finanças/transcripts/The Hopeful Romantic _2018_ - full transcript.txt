--== McEphie ==-- [lively music playing] [clock ringing] Good morning! Hello there. I still have time. Five minutes. Yeah. Okay. Morning routine. Son. [screams] -Mommy! -What are you doing? -May God have mercy on you! -I'm just having my morning protein— I mean, morning prayer! Morning prayer, Mommy! What are you doing with my lotion? That's from Korea! That's expensive! This is for whitening! My skin's getting dry. Sorry. -Son. -Daddy. Back in our time, cooking oil was enough for us. Okay, Dad. Let me give you some. It's still hot. I'll go take a bath now. [dad laughing] Later, okay? [giggling] Good morning. Good morning! [Jess] Whose child is that, Mommy? This is your friend's, Antonio. Maybe he needs to go home to his parents. Does he eat solid food already? Maybe he's still breastfed. Okay, let's pray. Lord, baby Jesus, please bless this food that we are about to eat, and please bless the hearts of my parents so that they don't need to take me to work because Lord, I need to go to work alone so I can find "The One" and give them their long-awaited grandchild. In Jesus we pray. Amen! -Amen! -Amen! [mom] Remember this. Your "weapon" should only be used if you're already married and for your… One and only -true love. -True love. -[engine roaring] -[girls giggling] -Hi, Jess! -[lively music playing] Hey, Jess! Jess! Please tell your mom that we will be late in paying rent. -Please, Jess. -Please, dude. Please! -[Jess] Okay, okay! -Yes! Thank you, Jess! -You're welcome. -Love you, bro! -Thank you! -Enjoy, buddy. [sensual music playing] You look stunning as always, baby girl. For real? As in, "for real"? Yes, of course. You like it? Let's take it. [erotic sigh] I like it, but… I like this one too, and this one, also this one. Everything in here. Actually, I'm confused which one to get, honey. They're all beautiful. Then we'll take everything. Please pack everything! We'll buy everything she wants. Thank you, honey. [lively music playing] [woman] What are you saying? How dare you be with another woman! You're a womanizer! You never change! [Ang] It's all suspicions! -[woman] I saw it with my two eyes! -[Ang] Have I ever done that before? -[Ang] I didn't do anything. -[woman] What are you saying? Doc Ang! How are you? Here are the tickets you told me to buy for you and Mrs. Ang. "Levi Soriano, One Night Only." Two VIP tickets as you ordered. [chuckles softly] And I also reserved the champagne room for your romantic dinner. It's all set. Really, honey? You're so sweet! You really love me, honey. -Yes, you're the only one I love. -Shall we? Alright. Okay. Not my armpits! You know I'm ticklish! That's enough. [woman] Hi, Jess! -Good morning. -Good morning! Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. -Morning, dude. -Hi, Jess! -Good morning. Hey, man. Good morning, my beautiful Jen-jen. Do you still have those complimentary tickets? Of course! Always for you. That's what I like about you. I owe you. [man] Okay. I'll go there now. -Honey, I'm sorry, but I have to go now. -That's really sad. Hm? Where should I take you, ma’am Evita? Uh… Hey, Jess! Jess! Hey, bro. Oh. Later, okay? Ross will bring the girls for you. I'll introduce them to you. Nice. You seem unmarried. Of course. I think I'll pass. I have an opening schedule tomorrow. I'm running for a promotion. Come on! You only think of work! What do you want? Employee of the year, employee of the decade, or employee of the galaxy? Employee of the galaxy. Is there such a thing? If there is, I'll go for it! You should chase after girls. This is for you. So you can finally have a girlfriend. Are you using the techniques I taught you? -Jess! Jess! -Yes, I memorized all of it. Mr. Valerio has checked out from room 5667. -He's now at the drop off. -Got it. -Hurry. -Later, bro. Both of you, your trolleys are scattered on the second floor. Please organize them. [silly music playing] Lord, please let it not be a bomb. I don't want to die a virgin, Lord. [car honks] Lord! Lord, please! Lord… Lord, please! [moaning nervously] Huh? Here, in The Manila Hotel… Oh wait. -Hold on. -Sir. Where are you going? Sir, I'll just give this… Are you late? I've been here since this morning. Maybe you're late. What did you say? You need to find the bag. I need that bag! Steven, you have to find Mr. Benedicto's bag. I’m a regular customer here. -First time that happened. -We know that. -We will look everywhere. -That bag is important to me. -For all you know, that bag will… -It's very important! Is this the bag? Yeah! That's my bag! You deserve a reward. Thank you. Don't worry, I will give you a reward for your honesty. -Thank you. -No, not that. Sorry. I'm sorry. Mr. Sylvester, thank you so much. You really run The Manila Hotel very excellently. My pleasure. Thanks. Please escort Mr. Benedicto. -[boss] Excuse me. -Sir, I would like to report. Jessie Prominente-- Wait, excuse me. What's your name again? Monette Medved, sir. -Monette? -Hotel Supervisor, at your service. Consistent Employee of the Month for the past ten years and still running for the Employee of the Year for three consecutive years. Okay, Monette. What's a good reward for an honest employee? Well, an all-expense-paid and all-access to all amenities of this opulent The Manila Hotel for four days and three nights. Four days' stay at our McArthur Suite, makeover, and shopping spree, 200,000 pesos cold cash, and he will be the Employee of the Year. Perfect, Monette. All of those is for the honest employee, who is Jess. Huh? Him? Are you sure? Are you questioning my authority? No, sir. -Jess! -Sir? For the next four days, I want you to live like a king. Yes, sir. Thank you. And you can invite two friends to join you. Jess, you will be the Employee of the Year this December. [medium-tempo music playing] [heavy breathing] [phone rings] Is it deadline already? Okay, I'll pay for it. No, I'll go there. Of course, it will be paid. Okay, bye. I love you. [bottles clanking] [man] Look at Ross. He hits on anyone. Hey, Ross! Choose who to hit on! -Hey! -Dude! Congrats! Thanks for choosing us as your plus one and one on your reward instead of your family. Why don't we have girls for room service? Hey! That's not allowed! You're already married. Come on. Don’t tell me you’re the only ones who will enjoy the rewards. I'll get your share. What share? No one will get girls tonight! You're gay, aren't you? He's NGSB. -No Girlfriend Since Birth. -Crazy! I didn't say that! Haven’t I told you guys? One of my girlfriends was Abby. We could've been matched, -but she's snobbish. -[crowd cheering] If that's the case, why didn't we know about it? [Jess] It didn't work… Let's get out of here. [Jess] …because I have no time for snobbish people. -Maybe because you're a virgin! -[crowd screaming] -You're a virgin! -[Jess] I'm not a virgin! [Jess] I am not. When did you last score? What score? Shag. [Jess] Last week, with Tatiana! Who are you? Don't you remember me, baby? I'm Tatiana! Tiyanak? Sorry! [silly moaning] [Jess] The moment we got in the room, I was already holding her… You know. [man] What? [Jess] You know. -[screaming] -[man] What is it? [Jess] That thing! You're a virgin. I said I'm not. -You are! -How old are you? I said I'm not a virgin! Whatever, man. [woman] Honey, it's a nice place. Just tell me what you want and I'll buy it for you. -Really? -Yes. -Excuse me. -Thank you, honey. What's the meaning of this? Who is this girl? Don't make a scene here. I'm done with you. I got bored. Nothing happens between us. -Let's go, hon. I'm hungry. -[man] Let's go. [Jess] Hello, there. Let's get it on? Is it your first time, sir? -No, it's not! -[man] Boys, let's go? [surprised gasp] [Ross screams] Why did you have to hide it for so long? We could've done something about it. He wanted it. It's not that. I'm waiting for my true love. When I finally find her, it will be the right moment to give myself to her. Wow. How conservative! Where will we find her, then? The only virgins left are the ugly ones. Hey, come on! Are you ready to be rich and famous? -G! -[upbeat music playing] Good evening. Do you come here often? Do you want to come on me? I mean, to me. Oh my gosh, I'm sorry. Hi. I'm Sugar Twinkle. -How are you? -Hello, auntie. Oh, darn it! Why are you paying respect to me? Someone's got a crush on you! -That one. -Oh? Ted! -Hey! -She says hi! [Jess] Thank you so much. It tastes like… Blade! [bright music playing] [wind blows] -Buddy. -[man] What is it? [Jess] Do you remember that song we sing? [man] I don't remember it. [Jess] Just do it. -Here we go again! -Go ahead. You can do it. [mic screeching] [Jess clears throat] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you're having a great night. And, uh, I would just like to offer a beautiful song for this, uh, beautiful night. I hope you enjoy it. Can I have Sex On The Beach, please? Right away, ma’am. Sorry, I don't sex on first date. [chuckling] Thank you. Cheers. That was a beautiful song. Who was that for? For… you. [chuckling] Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Is that a Rolex Submariner? No, no submarine. I just ride a car. [laughs] Um, excuse me. [stammering] Hon? Hon, are we leaving? -Come here. -[stammers] Ouch. I'm not stupid to spend money on you while you flirt with somebody else. I just gave compliments to the singer! It was a harmless conversation! Oh, come on, Jenny! Let's not fool each other! What will I even get from a woman like you? You're tough, huh? Come here! -Let me go! -Come here! Come-- Go away! Go away! I don't want to see your face again! You worthless whore! Take your stuff out from my suite! Are you okay? I'm okay. Thank you. [gentle music playing] You just stepped on my foot. [sobbing] -I'm sorry. -But it's not painful. -Cheers. -Cheers. What really happened between you and your uncle? -Why were you fighting? -[laughs] Your uncle's a jerk. He's not my uncle. He's my boyfriend. Huh? He's your boyfriend? Why is he old? Let's not talk about him. You… Are you staying here? Yes, yes. At the McArthur Suite. Wow. Really? McArthur Suite? Yes. You must be rich. Not really. Just right. You're so humble. That's what I like about men. Down to earth when, in fact, he's well-off. And… …you have a sense of humor. Gentleman. My rich ex-boyfriends are selfish and assholes, but you're different. Cheers? Okay. Cheers. I'll go ahead. Nice meeting you. [Jess] Uh… You… [stammers] Nice meeting you. [giggles] I have to pee. -You want me to do it here? -You can't, sir! [moaning] Hey. Hi. Sorry, I fell asleep. I was just resting. It's okay. Uh… Do you want to stay at my suite? Only if you want. Because… …no loitering allowed here in The Manila Hotel. [romantic music playing] [giggling] You're so gorgeous when your eyes are closed. This way. [tipsy giggle] [elevator pings] [Jess] Hey, Pongs! Sir, good morning, sir. Good morning. You're so pretty. Yes. [moans] [Jess] We might need it later. [laughs] Wait! Why? Are you a virgin? No! -Are you gay? -Of course not! -It's just-- -Then what's the problem? [shouts] Wait a minute. Do you want to… Wait. Wow. It's so white! It's because I use whitening lotion. [romantic music playing] [gasping] [gushing] [erotic groaning] [shouts] [feel-good music playing] [groaning] Good morning, handsome. Good morning. It's not a dream. Good morning, guys. [screams] What are you doing here? Let's have breakfast. Who is he? My cousin Ross. You don't act like a first-timer. So you are a virgin. No. No. Never. -[Ross] Never! -Get out of here. Get out! You're so hot-tempered! [Jess] What's that? Sorry. -Here. Watch TV. -[screams] Sorry about that. He's… he's special. Sorry, I didn't catch your name last night. No need to catch it. It's not falling. But I am. I'm Jess. My name is Jess. Jess as in… Jes… toni. Jestoni Gonzaga. I'm Veronica. But you can call me anything you like. After all, I'm yours. [chuckles] Wait. I'll brush my teeth first. I have bad breath. -Sure. -It's embarrassing. Wait. This is mine. Sorry. Just a moment. [muffled screaming] Who's the virgin now, huh? You? Me? No one's a virgin here! No one's a virgin! [grunting] Papa Jesus, sorry if I lied. Sorry for what I did, but… I will marry her, I promise. Promise. She's the one I will marry. Because she's my true love, Lord God. I'm sure, Papa Jesus, she's my true love, 110%. Hi. I’ll go further, Lord Jesus. Sorry if I'm going to lie now. Not just now. Tomorrow and the next day. It's the last. Promise! Thank you. Hi, I'm rich. Not my name. Shall we go shopping? [Jess] Babe. Baby? Babe! Baby? Hey. Babe? Ouch. I’m sure it was not a dream. Baby! Sweetheart! Honeybunch! Cupcake! Munchkin! Where are you? [Jess] Where is she? Jen. Have you seen a beautiful woman? -A beautiful woman? -If you see her… There she is! Oh, come on! Not you! [Jen] Not me? But I'm beautiful. -Hey, Jess! My favorite attendant is here! -Vero… Doc! Is it your day off? Yes, it's my day off. Why are you wearing a bathrobe in the lobby? You checked in? Yes, I checked in. -I'll go ahead. -Wait. Do you still have tickets like the one you gave me? My wife wants to take two of her friends. Doc, it's my day off, but… Jen-jen, do you still have complimentary tickets? Give me two. Hurry. Hurry. Here. Friend, let's see each other at the driving range in Wack Wack sometime. Bring your favorite golf cart. Bye. See you. Where have you been? I thought you went somewhere. Um, what's our plan for today, babe? Plan? What do you… -Ah! -Well… Do you want me to remind you what happened last night? No! No need. I remember. Good. So here's what. Go upstairs to your room, I'll just have a quick brunch, and then I’ll follow you there to get dressed, and then we'll go out. Sure, sure. Sounds very good. Can you charge my brunch to your account? Brunch? Sure, sure. Uh… Miss, please charge her breakfast to my account. -Your account? -Yes, right away. May I get your credit card, sir, so that we can put hold-charge just in case? Credit card? Yes, credit card. It's in there. It's here? -Really, sir? -It's in the system. Go check it out. -What are you doing? -Just do it. Just put it on my account-- I mean my reward. Oh, it's here, sir. I found it! -Perfect. -Yes, ma'am. Found it! -Enjoy. Everything's good. -Okay. -Thank you so much. -I'll see you later. See you, babe. Dude, I have a problem. Let's go find Ted. [Jess] You don't know where the old lady Ted was with stays? Aren't you a bellboy? [Ross] I have no idea. I’m not a bellboy today. -We went our separate ways last night. -[scoffs] Have you seen Ted? I didn't notice. Thank you. -Do you want me to help you? -No, I’m okay. -How are you? -I’m okay. [muttering] Hey. Here. -Here, in Andres Bonifacio Suite? -Jen-jen said Ted is here. Ted. I told you he's not here. Jen-jen said he's here. -Is she a liar? -[Ted] Where are you, my Sugar Twinkle? [Ted] Where are you? -Ted! -Ted! What happened to you? Madame Twinkle is so wild! The old lady you were with last night? She won't come back. Probably had a heart attack. Don't drink that. That's where she puts her false teeth. That's why it tastes like cavities. [retching] [moaning] Come on! Please stop! -Let’s go. I have a problem. -Okay, okay. I found my true love. I shouldn't let her go, right? Intense! You just got devirginized and now you already love her? I said I'm not a virgin anymore. Why are you insisting on that? Not a virgin anymore! [Ross] What kind of help do you need? You'll pretend you're rich. You're going to deceive somebody. -That's bad, bro. -Just for three days. I will tell her I'm not rich after three days. I promise! I just need her to fall in love with me in three days. You're that handsome? -That's uncertain! -You don't need to pretend you're rich. You're handsome deep inside. How about on the outside? That's hard to answer, bro. You don't have a house. You have no car. How are you going to pretend to be rich? How will you do that? -You're going to pretend… -[Ross] We're doing good here. -Hurry! Hurry! -Let's go! -I can't. Doc Ang will get mad. -You're offending me. -[mutters] -Good morning, ma'am. My parents raised me with high principles. Even if I grew up alone, I have my own principles! Then you're going to bribe me with 50 pesos? You can't buy me. Seventy? Do you think I'll crack for 70? That's not right! Seventy-five? Eighty? You can't buy my principles! What do you really want? I said, what do you want? [romantic music playing] [erotic moaning] -Babe. -Hello, babe. You have a nice car. Yes, of course. Jess, take care of the car! So what do you do for a living? I'm a doctor. Yes. Wow. Doctor of? Heart. Doctor of heart. Cardiologist. Yes. Yes, cardio. I've always wanted to become a doctor. I've heard about this ECMO. The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The portal device that they use in open heart surgery. Do we have that here in the Philippines? Yes, yes. Yes, very good. In Banawe. [chuckles] I'm sorry. It's messy. You don't talk that much. -Huh? -I like you. I like you, too. Aren't you going to ask me about myself? I don't need to. I love you no matter who you are. What? Rice cake! I want some rice cake. I'm hungry. -Oh. -You want to eat? Let's eat! Where do you want? Actually, I want to buy something first. Sure! Let's go to Tutuban. -[laughing] -[upbeat music playing] You're funny! Let's go to Vertis. Vertis? Sure. -[Veronica] What countries you been to? -[Jess] There are too many! I mean… Too many to mention. [Veronica] Like? Uh, Venezuela. Uh, Canada. Cainta. You know. [Veronica] Have you been to Australia? Yes, yes, yes. [Jess] It's a very beautiful country. Really? I love it there! I love you, too. Your dress! Uh, I love your dress! Really? Should I get it? You should get it. [Veronica] You're single, right? No. Yes! I mean, uh… none. I mean, no girlfriend. Very good. [Veronica] I'll get this one. I'm only getting this one. No, I'll pay for it! -Are you sure? -Yes! -It's not right. -No, I insist. I'll pay in cash. Okay. Uh… How much? So… What hospital do you work in? Children's hospital. Didn't you say you're a heart doctor? Yes. Yes, uh… I'm a-- I'm a heart doctor for children. -Yes. Yes. -Oh… I see. Sir, may I have your card, please. Thank you for today. You're welcome. Oh, um… Let's go eat. I'm hungry. Let's go back. Okay. Wow. Thank you. Sorry, the line was long at the restroom. Why haven't you started yet? [lively music playing] Just a second. I'll be back. Can I borrow this? -Sure. -I’ll be back. So, where are we going next? Uh… I'll take you home now. I'm having an upset stomach after eating. Uh… wait. Uh, let's just go to your place instead. Huh? Wait. It's… My house is… Uh… You're single, right? Yes, single. Very, very single. Then let's go to your place. Alright. Uh… [clears throat] Hello, what do you need today? [clears throat] Siri, take me home, please. I'm sorry. Who are you? I don't know you. [laughs nervously] Siri's being silly sometimes. Wait. [clears throat] Uh… Siri, take me home, please. Okay. Fine. You don't know where you live? Huh? I'm just confused because I have many houses. Around 25. You have arrived. So this is it? Yes. This is my house. -[car honks] -[chuckles nervously] [car honks] Just a second. Manang. Manang, please open the gate. Man. [upbeat music playing] Open the gate. What happened to you? There's… -Uh… -There's a tree. The gate's automatic. I just pressed it here. Yes, of course. I forgot. Shall we? -Sure. -Yes. Let's go. Wow. Amazing! Is this the first time you see your house? Yes. This is the first time I see it in daytime. I always go home late. I have many operations at the children's hospital and… whenever I go home… Babe, are you okay? Are you hiding from someone? Yes. The maids. I told them I'm out of town-- Out of the country. That's my… That's my, uh, living room. There. Yeah. As you can see, it's fully furnished, and it's… Oh, you have a pool! Yes, I have a pool. It's nice, right? [sensual music playing] Can I swim? Can you… Are you sure? But if you insist… Okay. -[water splashing] -[upbeat guitar music plays] Come on, babe. What are you waiting for? -Oh. -Huh? [grunts] [grunts] Hi. Who is he? -My grandpa! -Good afternoon. -[grunts] -Grandpa! Good afternoon. He's going to get mad. He doesn't like people in swimsuits. -Really? -Yes. -Grandpa. -[grunts] Grandpa, sorry. Let's go back to your room. Let's go back. Let's go back to your room. Babe, what's going on? -We're going on! -Huh? I remembered I have a meeting. -Really? -Yes. [grunts] Babe. He's following us. Grandpa, don't follow us. You go ahead, babe. You go ahead, I'll follow you. Grandpa. No, not here. Bye, Grandpa. -Here, here. -Nice to meet you. -Stay there. Bye, Grandpa. -[Grandpa screams] Jess? I'm coming soon, babe! Babe, let's go. Let's go? Who are you? What are you doing here? Nanny! You go see Grandpa. How did you get in here? She's asking for a raise. Go! Or I'll fire you! How did you get in here? I'm calling the police! Thieves! [laughing] [phone rings] -Hello? -[Ted] Where are you? Doc's been looking for the car. Hello? Yes! -Yes, of course. -Why are you taking so long? -Come back to the hotel. -Sure. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, bye. What's that about? That's my secretary. She just told me about some… details. Babe, sorry about what happened. Those people are newbies at the house. That's okay. You're actually funny. I feel so lucky. I hope… I'll marry someone like you. [gentle music playing] [Ted] Bro, that's too much. You'll end up broke with that girl. When will you stop this? I don't know. She's different. -There's something about her that… -[Ted] What? I just can't stop it. [Ross] I think I know what kind of a woman Veronica is. They are called gold diggers. -[Ted] Gold digger? -[Jess] What? A gold digger is a woman who's only after someone's money. Ah. Take that back! No! [Ted] You get smart when you're drunk. [Veronica] See if it looks good on you. That's five gives, one month to pay. You have to pay every five days? Yes! How much are you trying to save? Not much, but while we're here, I'm still paying for Pedro's school. I still have to pay for a lot of papers. That guy you just met, are you sure he's the one? Yes, so far. I saw all the evidence. -Mansion? -Yup. -Car? -Chrysler 2016. -Impressive! Profession? -Doctor. Heart doctor for children. Those exist? -Commitment? -Single. Very single. Amazing! I'm so happy for you. You'll be out of the shithole in no time. Oh, how I wish! [laughs] You can use this for any event. That's cheap. Wow! [woman] It's beautiful. Look. Take what you want! Pay me now if you have money. Oops. Look who's here. -You’re becoming snobbish. -Let me go or I’ll have you arrested. Don't you remember? If you have me arrested, you’ll be compromised. [woman] Look at that beautiful girl. She looks rich. Pedro? -Sis! -[cock crowing] What are you doing? I'm getting Kenny smoked. I ordered ginger chicken soup for you. Chicken? It's your favorite, right? Come on, sis. Is there anything else? Why did you transfer to another dorm? This place is far from your school. Chickens weren’t allowed at my previous dorm. You value your chickens too much. Why don’t you take me with you to your condo? Stop asking questions! Here. Your balance for this semester. You've been studying vet medicine for a long time. When will you graduate? Stop asking too many questions. Vet medicine is really tough. Thank you, sis. Am I the only one you’re waiting for? Aren't you and your boyfriend getting married? I am sure of the wedding, and you’re the only one I’m waiting for. Soon, I’ll be flying back to Australia. This is nice. -Yeah. -Are you ready to order, madam? Uh… Mmm. What do you want me to eat, babe? Me? [laughs] Okay, I'll have some Slab of Ribs… [waiter] Mm-hmm. …Pino and Almas Caviar… [waiter] Mm-hmm. …lobster frittata, and Greek salad. Oh! And I'll have a Golden Opulence Sundae. [waiter] Okay, ma'am. How about you, babe? Me? Uh… -I'll have some water juice, please. -[waiter] Water juice? [Veronica laughs] Yeah. [Veronica] You're so cute. No, seriously. I'll just have water. I'm on a… intermission… inter… Diet! -[waiter] Would that be all, sir? -Yes. You can go now. You seem hungry. Not really. It's so delicious! -Yes. -[waiter] Here's your dessert, ma'am, sir. -This is it? -[waiter] Yes, sir. -[Veronica] Wow! -You can have this pawned! I mean, it looks good. It's good. I like you so much. I… I like you so much, too. No, really. How did I chance on you single? You're attractive and… rich. Stop it. That's why I'm so lucky. You're not hard to love. You too. I'm not sure about that. I've been in many relationships. They didn't work. Maybe I give too much of myself. Anything for someone you love, right? Anything for someone you love. Sir, your bill. Yes. Excuse me. Can I have some wine, please? [waiter] Yes, ma'am. For a while. -More wine? -Yes. Babe, I'll just go to the restroom. -Sure. -I'll be quick. Jess. You're here. What are you doing here? My wife went to the hotel. That's why Star Apple and I sneaked out. You're with Ashley? -Ashley? -Yes. No, Doc. Her name is Veronica. So Ashley's name now is Veronica? Her ex-boyfriend is my patient. Okay, Doc. I'll go to the restroom. See you. Waiter. Here you go. -I receive 22,000. -That's right. Okay, bye. Thank you. [sighs] -Who is that? -[Jess] Huh? That's Doc Ang. He owns the house and the car. -What? -What? I mean, he's the one who referred me to buy the sports car and the house. [coughs] He said he knows you. He said your name is Ashley. But I told him maybe you just look similar. He mistook you. Probably. Let's go. -Why is this tip box open? -I didn't see, sir. -Babe. -You always say that! -It was here in front of you. -What's going on there? -Sorry sir! -Nothing! Let's go. Do you want this to be your last day? [Jess] Dude, are you sure this is real? -Of course, Jess. -You might give me a fake one. Of course, that's real. Here. Here's your change. Thank you. -[romantic music playing] -[soft moaning] May I? [soft chuckle] Veronica. I love you. No matter what happens, I'll love you with all my being. [Jess] What a great view, isn't it? Are you okay? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. You don't seem to be. The truth is I want to… Look… thank you. For earlier? For yesterday? -For what? -For everything. You're the only one… …who did those things for me. I felt so special. I really felt that someone loves me. -Jess. -Veronica. I want to tell you something. I want to be honest. I think it'll be unfair if… Lord, please grant me the wish I've been waiting for. What are you saying? Veronica. I love you so much. You're my true love. I will admit, you're my first. You're the one I want to be with for the rest of my life. That's why I want you to know who I really am. I want you to know that… that… Uh… Will you marry me? [gentle music playing] Yes. Yes, I will marry you. I love you so much. I love you too. [upbeat guitar music playing] [Jess coughing] -I told you I'm ticklish. -[laughing] [indistinct whispering] [giggling] [romantic music playing] Mom! Dad! What are you doing? Why are you wearing just one top? We're saving on laundry. Why are you in the dark? We're saving on electricity. And you? Why were you gone for so long? You didn't come home for three days. I rendered overtime. Seventy-two-hour shift so I can have a promotion quickly. It's bad to lie. I know that. That's enough. Go to sleep. You too. And pray for all your deceptions. Okay. I'll also pray for what you're doing. [Jess] Good morning, my love. I didn't wake you up. You slept well. But you can stay in the room if you want. You can leave. Actually, I prefer if you stay away from the hotel. That's all. Mwah hugs. Hi, sir. Here's your juice. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Wow. You're back to work. How's our loverboy-- I have a problem. My three days is up. I can no longer pretend. Then tell her the truth. I was supposed to tell her last night, but… I suddenly proposed. Where did you get money to buy a ring? That's not important. My problem is she said yes. Are you serious? You're a liar. What will I do? If you're in my place? If I tell her the truth, I will lose her. You have no choice. You said you'd make her fall in love with you in three days. So, were you able to? I think so. You're getting crazy. You're just fooling each other. That woman, that goalkeeper kind, it is impossible for her to love you. You're not helping! Dude, red alert! -Give me the card. -What? -Card. I mean card key. -Card? For the penthouse! You can't! We have guests in there! I'll be quick. You will get me in trouble. -Come on! -You can't! Thank you, bellboy. You can leave now. Ma'am, can I borrow this? I'll be quick. -That's mine! -[Veronica] Jess! Jess! Jess! I knew you were still here. Veronica. Why did you suddenly leave last night? Did I do something wrong? Nothing. Uh… I-- I have, uh… I had a business call. I mean, a client called. [Veronica] Ohh. Your cousin's a bellboy here? Yes, I am! And he's-- Yes! Yes! He's the bellboy because he's kind, and he's the grand winner of his family. Grand winner? Breadwinner! Let's go back! Cousin, juice upstairs, please! Let's go back to the penthouse. Thank you for bringing me breakfast. Did you like it? Babe, I'll check it out first if it's clean. -Sure. -I'll be quick. -Wait, okay? -Okay. [mysterious music playing] [stammering] Hello. W-What's-- what's your name? You're so cute. What's your name? Here's for you! [Jess grunting] Catch me! Come here! Bang. Bang. [boy] You lose! [Jess] It doesn't hurt. [boy] Go away! [tense standoff music playing] Babe! Why are you shooting the kid? No! He's my nephew. What's going on? -Here they are. -What are you doing here? My sister, my brother, and my niece! -Who are they? -Good afternoon. No, they're snobbish too. Let's go! [Veronica] Babe. Have you tried this before? [Jess] Yes. -[Veronica] I'll go down now, okay? -[Jess] Sure, sure. -[Veronica] Are you okay, babe? -[Jess] I'm okay. [screams] Sorry, I fell for you. [Veronica] Sorry. -[Veronica] I’m so full. -[Jess] I know. [Jess] Sorry if we ate at a cheap place today. [Veronica] That’s okay. For a change. You’re actually fun to hang out with. I like being with you. Thank you. What? What? You're so funny. Is that so? Where’s your watch? I didn’t wear it. For a change, too. I have a gift for you. But don't open it yet. I’m a bit shy. Thank you. -Here. -You’re welcome. What’s this? Open it. I thought you might be going there and… I want to be your date. Sure. Alright. [man] There is no way that I will allow that kind of behavior in this hotel. You have pink hair! That is not proper. The Manila Hotel will not tolerate that kind of behavior. And please, please, please stop your indecent behavior with one of our revered guests in our hotel. Sir. I can take what you said about removing my pink hair, -but with Sugar-- -The decision of the board is final. You’ll be suspended for 30 days starting next cut-off. See, bro? You knew it was wrong, and yet you still did it. It's what makes me happy. I'll stand by it. Dude. Hon. I will lend this to him, okay? Thank you, dude! Where's the watch Mr. Benedicto gave you? I pawned it so I can have money to spend on Veronica. I told you you're going to get broke with her. Fine. Honey, Jess will borrow this one, too, okay? Is she still alive? Of course! Very alive! Sugar. I love you! I love you, too, baby Ted! And yes, Jess, I'm alive! Sorry, ma'am. Go now. Take care of those. Thank you. And you can't go on like this for so long. Yes. I'll tell her the truth later. Promise. I think I'll just stay here. Why? They are all doctors. You know them. I know some of them. Really? See that guy? Dr. John Albert Ferrer, one of the most prestigious doctors here. He's my idol. Can you introduce us? We're not close. And he's a womanizer. Let's stay away from him. Oh! What about that guy? Dr. Miguel Livelo. Success story of super conjoined twins. Him, too. He lives in many places. That's why… Actually, babe, I'm not friends with anyone here. Because I studied in the States, right? That's okay. You're still a doctor. Yes, of course. -Come on. Let's go. -Why? Doc! Hey, Jess! Why are you here? And you're with Ashley. Veronica. Well… This is my wife Susan. Susan, this is Jess. My most favorite valet attendant at The Manila Hotel. [Susan] Are you always in The Manila Hotel without me? Yes, ma'am. -Yes, always. -[Doc] Never. No. [Susan] Then why most favorite? I think you must be mistaken. Jess is a doctor, not a valet. [Doc] Of course he is, Ashley. Doc, where's Star Apple? Who's Star Apple? Jess. Is this your day off from the hotel? [Doc] Why are you here at the doctors' conference? Because… Veronica. They are both cardiologists. [Doc] Ashley, he's not-- I'm not… Ashley. Tell me what's going on. -Why are you close? -Veronica! -Veronica. -What about the sports car? -I'm just a valet attendant. -The mansion? It's also Doc Ang's. What other lies have you told me? I didn't mean it. I really wanted to tell you! -I was supposed to tell you tonight. -Tonight? Tonight because I already said yes the other night? Tonight because you already fooled me? Tonight because you think that you can tell me the truth since I will forgive you because I already love you? No. Veronica. All the feelings I showed you were real. -I got scared-- -You're a coward, too! You're just like the other men who treat me like a toy. Disposable. [melancholic music playing] I can't believe this is happening. I can't believe I had feelings for you. I'm different. I'm different, Veronica. Please believe me. I'm not like the other men who can give you anything, but I love you. I love you. You're my true love. That is true! You fooled me. You love me, but you fooled me. I didn't want that to happen. I admit, I pretended! I pretended to be rich because… because… that's the only way for you to notice me. That's the only way to get into your world. If you knew I was a valet attendant, would you love me? Or are you just going to treat me like the rich men you dated? [gasps] Is your name really Veronica? Or Ashley? Or Evita? I know you're hiding something from me, too. But that's okay. Because I love you. I love you, Veronica. I'll accept you even if you're just pretending. I hope your love for me isn't pretending. That was a terrible thing you've done. I'm so disappointed in you, Jess. Dr. Ang is complaining because you used his car. And you even went to his house? And you put his father under the stairs? This was seen on the CCTV cameras. I'm sorry, but Dr. Ang's one of The Manila Hotel's most revered guests. He wants you fired. Sir. Even his marriage was ruined. You know, we, here in The Manila Hotel, hold all our employees at the highest standard, and you have to have good moral values. You were supposed to be Employee of the Year. And you were running for a promotion, Jess! What happened? Sorry. I'm sorry. What I did was wrong. I'll accept that you're going to fire me. I'll go now. -Jess. -[melancholic music playing] Jess. [upbeat music playing] Hi. Do you come here often? Yes. How about you and your boyfriend? Boyfriend? Ew! Hi! Hi! Care to dance? Sure! [crowd cheering] [melancholic music playing] [woman] You know what the kryptonite of women like us is? It's love. Remember the three things you should never give to a man. Unless you already have a ring on your finger. Your name… [chuckles] …that thing between your legs, and love. Give one, and you will lose. I need to rise from all the misfortunes I experienced here. I just want to get back to my life in Australia. You already gave a lot. You have nothing else to gamble if you have already given your heart. Nothing! -Mom. -[mom moans] You're dressed, right? [mom] Yes. Okay, son, come in. [mom] Son. Are you okay? You're lying. You are not okay. Mom, I lost Veronica. Sorry. I know you always told me to marry the one I gave myself to first. -I don't think it'll happen. -[gasps] You're not a virgin anymore? [chuckles] You know, son. Just talk to her. I'm sure she will understand. Be brave. Face it all. Even the truth and… …and… the result of everything you did. Yes, Mom. Mom, I have one more to confess. What else from your body isn't a virgin? It's not that, Mom. What is it? I got fired. Son. Let's just pray. Let us… pray together. Okay. Most especially, ask for forgiveness from Veronica! Your mom's right, son. Dad! What are you doing there? I'm massaging your mom's feet. [mom] Ouch! [mom] That's my ingrown! Sorry. Veronica. Veronica. Or whatever your name is. Can we talk? Veronica, let's talk, please. Why? Forgive me, please. I'm a good person. A good person? We're both evil people. Just in a different way. What can I do to make you forgive me? Tell me. Anything. We shared something together, right? I tell you what. Maybe next year, you should go to Cambridge -or maybe Oxford. -[phone ringing] Or try Harvard. Wait. I have to take this. Okay, Dad. [screams] Are you okay? It’s alright. I’m okay. I'm Sylvester. Uh… I'm Nikki. Jess, I decided to give you another chance. But I cannot give you the same job you had here at The Manila Hotel. Instead, I will hire you as a personal driver and assistant. Really, sir? Yes. You've been an honest employee in this hotel for many years. You deserve a fresh start. Thank you, sir. Please, Jess. -This is really good. -[gentle music playing] -This is corn. Fantastic. -Thank you. [Sylvester] This is shrimp. It tastes good. -[Sylvester] Okay? -[phone rings] Hello? Okay. [Sylvester] Look, I have to go. I'm sorry. Jess, I have to go. -Take care of Nikki, okay? -Uh… -[Jess] Where will I-- -[Veronica] I don't know. I don't have a house. Are you surprised? No. Maybe you're thinking I'm having a great time doing this. It's not that. My dream was to become a doctor. [Veronica] I came back from Australia just for one reason. When my mother passed away, I came back for my remaining family. My stepbrother Pedro. You're an OFW? Oh. And I've been doing everything just to fulfill that. I'm fixing my brother's papers. There's just people who will take advantage of you. If you're an open-minded person, I can help you get a quick way to earn extra income. I'm in! I wanted to bring my brother to Australia. But I don't know what I was getting myself into. Girl, that was a scam. Sorry. What's that? Leon Carreon is a scammer. Name it. He has lots of scams. [Veronica] Leon Carreon deceived me. He took all my stuff and all the money of the people we recruited. But I might just have the solution to your problem. What do you say? [Veronica] I tried to fight him, but he has many connections. I'm doing this to return all that money and to fix me and my brother's life. I needed someone to help me, Jess. But I never gave myself to anyone. Never had. But with me… I have no use for you anymore. Soon, I will get out of this mess. You're resigning? Jess, why? I just need to fix something in my life first. That's it. [Jess] You're going to Australia? Yes. Finally. I just waited for James' approval of Nikki. I've been a single dad for such a long time. I'm glad he gave me a second chance to fall in love. I love Nikki so much. I will do anything for her. Anything for the one you love, right? [speaking in Tagalog] [mysterious music playing] [elevator pings] -Stop. Wait a minute. -[gasps] -[gasps] -Oh! He thinks we can't do that? -That's right. -Let's do it. [elevator pings] Veronica, wait. Hey, what happened? Talk to me. Did you see that guy in the elevator? Yes. Who is he? He's the swindler who ruined my life. Veronica. You guys are okay now? So it’s a happy ending after all? Guys, can you help me? [mysterious music playing] [Ted] Bro, you sure about this? We might get caught. He must be caught in the act. Someone told my Sugar Twinkle that Leon Carreon will have a party later at the McArthur. How can we get in? There's a guest list. It's by invite only. I'll take care of that. I'm sure my baby Sugar Twinkle's invited. Yes. Okay. Make sure my close friends' names are included in your guest list, okay? [mumbling] I know your boss personally. I know Leon, okay? Now, we will be there. Me and my friends, okay? Your invites are settled. [cheering] Thank you, ma'am! So enjoy! Especially you, my baby Ted. [giggling] -[upbeat music playing] -[woman laughing] -Are they here? -[laughing continues] Right there. Good evening. Welcome! Welcome, everyone! I hope everybody's having a blast! Yes! [Leon] Are you enjoying my party? Yes! [Leon] I propose a toast. Cheers! You're Veronica, right? I'm Jen-jen. Come with me. Why? Just trust me. -What? -Trust me! -What? -Just trust me! Let's go! Come on. [speaking Tagalog] [Ross] So spicy! You know what, Heidi? Poor you. I'll take care of you. I'll make you famous. Really? [Leon] Trust me. [Jess] That guy, twelve o'clock, he's the target. Okay, thank you. [Leon] Are you ready to get famous, Heidi? Yes, Papi. John Freud Carreon? We're the police. You have charges of estafa, falsification of documents, and sexual harassment against you. You must be joking. Maybe you got the wrong guy! I'm a star builder. I'm a talent agent! Tell them! I'll make you famous, right? I don't know! You said you'd make me famous but then you touched me inappropriately. Inappropriately? Ted, am I done? You're done! That woman is a liar! You have no proof! You have no complainant! You're wrong! You're all hard-headed! I'm going to give you a job! Does your scam go along with you making me famous? And me? And me, too? Even you, Pearly Shell? Not me. I just met him. What's this? Where did you take me? [screaming] I'll blow Amanda's head off! -No! -Go ahead. Try it! Wait. Who's Amanda? I don't care! Amanda! Where will you take me? Come on! Hurry, hurry! -Sir, let’s pass through here! -Faster. Run! -[indistinct talking] -[screaming] Veronica! Why did you get swollen? [speaking Tagalog] Veronica! -Sister, let's go! -[screaming] What’s happening? Get out of the way! Move, move! Veronica! Ouch! Keep quiet or I’ll shoot you! -Hurry. They’re getting away! -Get in! -Veronica! -Hurry, Jess! Downstairs! I'll ask Jiggs for help! I'll go to Sir Sylvester! I avoided you and yet you still follow me around. Hey! You’re the one who crashed my party. What? Let me go! You’re hurting me! Hey! Open up! Sir, it's open. [Leon] Get in! Let's go! [Leon] Start driving. Don't stop! [Jess] Yes, sir. [Veronica] Ouch! [Jess] Where are we going, sir? -[Leon] Just drive. -[tires screeching] It hurts! Let me go! Siri, take us home. Okay. Wait a minute. What's that? Nothing, sir. It's just the GPS. Hold the gun properly. Demons might play on you. No need. I will kill this woman myself. [Veronica] I will have you arrested! I got caught up in your scam even if I'm innocent. [Leon] Don't you dare. It's all my fault. I'm the one who scammed them. And all that money went through you. That's why you're involved. [Veronica] Heartless! That's right. That's why I'll end you now! [tires screeching] [Leon] Will you drive properly! Sir, they're here. That's it! Let's go! Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? [Siri] You just arrived. [Leon] Where are you bringing me? You're a useless driver! I'll drive! -Come here! -[Veronica] Ouch! Hey! Damn you! [speaking Tagalog] You're an animal! Let me go! -[groaning] -[screaming] [police siren wailing] Are you okay? I'm okay. They're here. -There he is. -Surrender now, John Freud Carreon! Raise your hands! Wait, sir. You have no proof of your accusations! We have the evidence! [Veronica] I got caught up in your scam even if I'm innocent. [Leon] Don't you dare. It's all my fault. I'm the one who scammed them. -That’s why you’re involved. -[Veronica] Heartless! [Leon] Damn you, Amanda. You will pay! Ouch! Sir, take him. Get up! How dare you make things more difficult for us. Take him away! Arrest him! Amanda. I still wanna say sorry. I still want your forgiveness. -Amanda, I will do everything to-- -Jess. I forgive you. [gentle music playing] [car door slams shut] -Dude. -[Sylvester] Nikki. Jess, are you okay? Are you okay? Jess. That's another heroic thing you've done. I'm so proud of you. Thank you, sir. And you, are you okay, Nikki? Or should I say Amanda? Yes. I already know everything. And I forgive you and accept it. So, let's get married in Australia. Let's go. Son. Are you okay? Dad. I'm okay. Sorry. I don't think I'll be able to marry my one and only true love. [sighs] That's okay. Even though that's how things ended up, we're still proud of you. Why, Dad? Because… Because of what happened, you had the courage to find out who you really are. Son, you're a good man. And that kindness is what should be loved about you by the one you will spend your life with. Not wealth. Not good looks. Thanks, Mom. Because you don't have those. Come on, Mom. [mom] But you are a good person, and you're willing to fight for your love. That's what you should show to the woman you will hopefully find. Your true love. [melancholic music playing] [sobbing] Thank you. [sobbing] [feel-good music playing] [Veronica] When Sylvester and I broke up, I had to look out for my own again. But we’re okay. We’re friends. [woman] Good to hear. At least you have a good life now. You're so lucky. You know what? We should meet. [Veronica] Yes, we should meet, Mixy. [Veronica] I miss you so much. [Mixy] I miss you too. [Veronica] Oh, wait. Good evening, ma'am. -I'll call you back. -[Mixy] Bye. Let's start the trip now. Ma'am Amanda. Siri. Take us home. Sweet! You're taking your true love home. ["Simpleng Tao" playing] [man] And… [screaming] -Sorry. I fell… for you. -You're too heavy. My groin! My groin! [man] Take five. Action! What about that guy? Doctor Miguer… Miguel Lever… [giggling] [laughing] What are you doing? Excuse me, Auntie. Auntie? You're a very stubborn kid. I'm just 35. -35? -Yes. Only 12 years older than you. Go enjoy, especially you my baby Ted. [giggling] [laughing] -Baby. -Hmm. You're the best. [laughing] [giggling] [chuckles] -[glass shattering] -[screams] [man] Cut! -Oh. No. -Yes. Oh! Why am I looking here? Sitcom. [Jess] How much? [Veronica] Pedro? [groans] Bro, your sister is very pretty. See this? This is your sister. What happened to your hair? I copied Kenny's style. I don't want to disturb you. Ma… It should be Mommy. I'm too old. -Memory gain. -I'm sure she will understand. And… Ah… She will understand, really! But I forgot. Talk to Veronica and ask for forgiveness. [moaning] Why are you smiling? And four, three, two.
