That's enough! That's enough! My ass is on fire! I thought I smelled some nuts roasting. Call it, Sparks. - This is Little John - who shot the sheriff. First weapons test terminated. Back up all telemetry and crash reference data. Nice shootin', Johnny. - Thanks, Sparky. - 'It feels good, though.' - Moving the capacitor - to the start - Really helped fix - the balance. - Always glad to help. - And whose idea was that? Let's, uh, take a closer look, senator. - Bring that video over here, - Burke. - On it, sir. - 'Oh, alright.' How's the voltage holding? Solid. Still got 57.2 megavolts. Check the amp-curve. It's perfect. You knew alloy really kept the barrel cool. Cool, just like you. 'Okay, I'll back up.' displays? Everything okay? Now, what about the data 'Yeah, it's great.' Impressive, isn't it? It's amazing weaponry. This was maximum power? Is that what you were told? Forgive my asking, ma'am. Uh, what's your security clearance? Level four. - Well, then I guess it's alright - for me to tell you - That I've personally made - some adjustments That increase the intensity considerably. - That would be - something to see. Always doing my best in the ma'am. service of my country, Well.. - Keep it up, - lieutenant.. Nathaniel Burke, ma'am. - Keep this up, - Lieutenant Nathaniel Burke And you'll be a captain in no time. Yes, ma'am. 'Senator Nolan, we're ready' 'for the next demonstration.' This village has been set aside for us as a training area. 'Ammo! Ammo!' This isn't, uh, people's rifle. - No, ma'am, - it's a sonic cannon. - It pumps out - an ultra-low-frequency Burst of sound energy. - Can take out - a whole line of troops. Without killing them. Just leaves them stunned. And you like that idea? Not killing 'em? Yes, ma'am, I do. - Set to a higher gain, - it can bring down An entire wall like that one. Why not the whole building? We haven't tested those parameters. - Everything's set on the street. - Let's do it. 'Go, go, go, go.' This is Little John. Get ready to storm the castle. 'Copy that, Little John.' May I do the honors, colonel? - 'Evacuate the area! Let's - Alright. Irons, stand down. go!' 'Target in sight..' - Go for it, lieutenant. - Yes, sir. Nathaniel, no! Sparky! 'Let's get the medic!' Sparky! When you managed to remove the concrete what did you find? The senator had been killed, sir. And Lieutenant Sparks? She had a severe spinal injury. And her legs had been crushed. She may never walk again. I can imagine how difficult it must have been for you. - Now, we've heard the testimony - that you shouted out To Lieutenant Burke just before he fired. Did you see how the weapon was calibrated? Yes, sir. What intensity level was set? The maximum, sir. - A parameter that had - never been tested Or even approved for testing, is that correct? Yes, sir. Burke knew what he was doing. Oh, is it? Who recalibrated the weapon? Lieutenant, who did it? Burke did it, sir. That's all.' 'Thank you, lieutenant. - Thanks for selling me out, - brother soldier. Out of my face with that. What you did was foul. I should bust your ass for what you did to Sparky. Bust my ass? Do you know where I was headed? You know what I could've done resources? with those military You stupid.. - Ugh! Ah. - Huh. Hey, man. - - He's lucky - He just got dismissed Instead of being sent to Leavenworth. - It's been a rotten damn deal - all the way around - But you're gonna feel - a whole lot better about this When we go back to work. - Now, we've got to create - a new unit here and press on.
