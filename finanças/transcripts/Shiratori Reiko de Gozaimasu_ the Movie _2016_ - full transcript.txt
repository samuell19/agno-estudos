Timing and Subtitles brought by The Reiko Rules Team @ Viki Stop, Reiko-san! Tetsuya-kun, don't get in my way! Reiko-san, calm down. Even if you try stopping me, I won't quit. That's impossible that Reiko-san... that you're cooking! It's fine! We've been living together for a year now. Tetsuya-kun, you've been making all of our meals until now. I will make dinner for a change. But have you ever tried cooking before? Of course, I haven't, because at our house we have five personal chefs. But I'm sure cooking is quite easy. Leave it to me, please. Our love for each other will grow even deeper with the help of the love spices I'll sprinkle in these dishes. It's in the way, isn't it? Thanks. Oh, Tetsuya-kun. I can't cook now! I'm sorry. I just want to stay like this with you for a little while. Tetsuya-kun! I'm making it right now! Reiko-san? Open your eyes. You'll cut your hand off. What? Yes, I know. It's done. The peels turned out bigger than the actual portion. What are you doing? I'm washing the vegetables. Are you supposed to wash meat? It's better for it to be clean, isn't it? Oh, that's true... Reiko-san, thanks for doing the prep work. I'll do the rest. What should I do next? Next? How about you sit there and watch? - Yes! - Okay. I'm about to pass out from hunger. Reiko-san, are you free this weekend? How come? A date? I'm going to a basketball training camp in Shimoda next week. Tetsuya-kun, are you planning on leaving me here alone? No, that's not what I meant. Can you hear me out? The training camp is actually close to our parents' homes. And I was hoping to introduce you to my parents, so I was wondering if you'd come with me, Reiko-san. What? Is that all? Introducing me to your parents? That... That means... a proposal, right?! This day has finally come! If I think back, it was 15 years ago. I could never forget the first time I met Tetsuya-kun. It was a very sunny autumn day. The location was... That's right! It was in front of the house behind mine, where Granny Bell lived! You two will definitely get married in the future. Is that really true? You're lying! It's because I can tell most things just at a glance. What should we do? "What should we do?" If you want to marry me so badly, I can agree to marry you. Why are you acting so self-important? Because of that day, there hasn't been a single day where I haven't been aware of my marriage with Tetsuya-kun! After that, many things happened. Tetsuya-kun got together with other women... What's with you? In other words, you guys are totally in love? Well, yeah. Reiko-san... Well, then, pardon me. It's cute! Here, open up! I was even almost forced to marry the person my father chose for me. You're all the more beautiful today. But this day has finally come, hasn't it? Well, rather than an introduction, it'll be more like a simple greeting. My mom nags a lot, and my father is a fisherman so he's unrefined. If you meet them, you'll probably be shocked. If we go to your parents' home, I'll have to cook and also clean! It's fine. After all, you're a guest. Well, take it easy. But really, it's just a simple greeting. I'll do my best! After all, if his parents like me, my marriage with Tetsuya-kun will become reality! [I Am Reiko Shiratori! The Movie] [Izu, Shimoda] Hey, what are you doing? Are you okay? Come now. Let's go. Are you nervous? Nice to meet you. I'm Reiko Shiratori. Are you okay? Maybe the Victorian era-like dress may have been better. How's my makeup? Isn't it too heavy? Is it okay? I told you, both are perfect. And my gloves. Maybe I should have gone for something more formal. Perhaps a different one would have been better. What should I do? I really went back and forth with another pair. [Protect Shimoda's ocean] [Stop Shimoda's resort development] [Stop promoting development] [Let's protect Shimoda's beaches] [Stop Akimoto at all cost!] [Shimoda Resort Development Plans!!] What is all this? I'm home. Welcome home, Tetsuya. Mom, what's with the signs outside? This is Reiko-san. It's very nice to meet you. Shi-Shiratori Reiko is my name. Oh my, hello. This is tea from a store frequented by the English royal family. Oh my goodness, thank you very much. But Tetsuya only drinks locally grown Shizuoka green tea, right? There's no way you didn't know what Tetsuya likes, did you? No, I actually like both. Reiko-san, you must be tired. Let's go inside and rest. Thank you, Tetsuya-kun. Is something burning? No, I just left the stove on. I'd like to help. Can you cook? It's what I do best. - Hey, over here. This way! - I'm sorry. Reiko-san, you don't have to help. I will do it, too. Really? Then can you add a pinch of salt to the pot and taste test it? What? What are you doing? Are you a Sumo wrestler? A "pinch" is a bit using your fingers. (Referring to the practice of throwing salt when entering the stage) Is that the case? Reiko-san must have been nervous, right? Okay. Hello, Obasan! Rumi-chan, welcome. Oh, Rumi. Tetsuya, you came home? Did you change your hairstyle? What do you think? It's on point, isn't it? What nonsense are you saying? - Your girlfriend? - Yeah. - This is... - I am the world-renowned Shiratori Reiko. Shiratori? You're very lovely. It's very nice to meet you. My name is Masuda Rumi. I'm a childhood friend of Tetsuya's, kind of like buddies. What do you mean by "buddies?" Hey, Tetsuya. I brought my newest creation. Do you want to taste test it? For real? I came home at the right time. Tetsuya, you're not really into sweets, but you'll always eat Rumi-chan's cakes. Reiko-san, would you like to try some? I'm sorry, I'll have to pass. I'm a tad bit tired. Are you okay? Please don't worry about me. Tetsuya-kun, please go ahead and have some. Are you sure? Then get some rest, okay? It's delicious! Wow, it's tasty! Rumi-chan, don't take over the farm. You should open up a cake shop instead. Really? I'm so happy to hear that! I need to make up for my mistake. Reiko-san, sorry to keep you waiting. What are you doing? I thought I'd clean up a bit. How do you make such a mess when cleaning up? I wonder how. Whichever household you marry into will have a hard time. But that can't be, Mother. I'm home! What's with this mess? I told you we were having a guest over. That guest is the one who made the mess. What? It's very nice to meet you. My name is Shiratori Reiko. I'm so shocked! What a beautiful lady you are. So true! You're too good for Tetsuya! We got a hold of a nice red snapper today, so I'd love for you to try it. Mother, clean up, clean up. I will fillet the fish! I will fillet the fish! Geez, what happened here? It's so good! I feel as if it's totally different from what I've had in the past. The fish here get plenty of food, so they are much fattier in comparison to what you get at other places. It's impossible to fish elsewhere unless you have the skills and experience that I have. That's amazing, Father! She called me, "Father!" I can't get enough of it. Say it again, say it again! Father! - What should I do? - What happened? - I wonder where I misplaced my precious ring. - What? - Masae-san, is that the one you treasured and wore all the time? - Yes. I received it as a gift from Grandmother (her mother-in-law) when we got married and I moved to this home. I was hoping to pass it on to Tetsuya's future wife one day. I will go look for it. Really? I'm sorry to trouble you. I think I left it in the kitchen. Reiko-san, I'll go with you. That's okay. I can go on my own. It's not there? No. That's quite strange. Maybe I lost it when I went shopping. Even if that's the case, Reiko-san's taking too long. Come on! You don't even take it off when you bathe and you lose it at a time like this? Well, I kind of... Reiko-san's missing. I'll go look for her outside. - Tetsuya, wait! - Come on already! I wonder where she wandered off to. I'll go have a look. You're such a troublemaker. You said you found it in your pocket? Like I said, I'm sorry. Sorry! Mom, properly apologize to Reiko-san! I'm so sorry. Why are you apologizing? I'm so happy your precious ring was found. My dear, will you help me cook again, Reiko-san? I'd love to! That's great, isn't it, Reiko-san? Does it look like I'll be able to see my grandchild's face sooner than I expected? Dear, you're getting ahead of yourself! How about I take you home, Reiko-san? Reiko-san, your parents' house is in Shimoda, too? Yes, it is. - Shiratori of Shimoda? - It can't be! Reiko-san, what does your family do? My father runs Shiratori Group and— What? - Hey, Dad! Stop it! - Get out of here! Hey! Take this back. We don't need anything like this. Hurry up and open the door! Leave! Shota, what's going on? Never show your face in front of us ever again! What are you doing, Dad? Tetsuya, those guys in her family are trying to kill us! Did you say they'd kill you? Tetsuya, right now in Shimoda, there are plans for a resort development by Kiryu General. They are trying to destroy the ocean for us fisherman. What does the development project have to do with Reiko-san's family? The company partnering with Kiryu is the Shiratori Group. The rich are looking down on us fishermen. Father, my dad wouldn't do such a thing— Stop calling me "Father" so casually! Go home! Tetsuya, never see this girl again! This has nothing to do with me and Reiko-san! Who cares? Come with me! Let me go! Reiko-san! Hey! You don't have to be so violent with him! Shut up! Sprinkle the outside with salt! (Japanese sprinkle salt to ward off bad spirits and bad luck.) This girl poured all our salt in the hot pot. What? - Forget it, dear! - Sh*t! Reiko-san! Reiko-san! Tetsuya-kun! - Reiko-san! - Stop it! Why? Why must we be torn apart? The construction will commence on schedule as per our plans. I see. I heard there are residents in opposition to the construction. No, it's just a few people making a ruckus! If things don't go according to plan, it'll be difficult to get funding. Now please don't say that. I'm fully aware. Welcome home, Reiko-chan! You should have called us if you were coming home. Daddy's home, isn't he? Master is in the reception room. That girl is always a daddy's girl no matter her age! Daddy, quit that kind of work right away! Reiko! I'm glad you came home! Who cares about that? More importantly, answer me immediately! Come on, introduce yourself. He is with Kiryu General. He is Chairman Kiryu's son Kiichi-kun. He is quite the talent even at his young age. It's very nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you, Miss. Is it the rumor of me being elegant, intelligent, and all-around, a perfect heiress? That's the polar opposite of the rumors I've heard about you. Don't you know anything about manners? I only have an interest in business matters. Which basically means you simply like making money, isn't it? Well, if you put it simply, yes. Well then, it seems like you have matters to discuss, so I will take this opportunity to leave. Okay, okay, okay! My apologies, Kiichi-kun! Daddy, why are you working on a resort development? Why? That's because it will be profitable. Does it only matter to you as long as we get rich? What are you even saying? All of Shimoda will profit from this. Huh? What do you mean? Look here. The areas surrounding the resort hotel are shopping arcades and restaurants which have been there a long time. Imagine tens of thousands of people coming from all over the country. Where do you think they will be shopping? Whose fish will they be eating? Is that really true? Just imagine this. Having a tropical drink at a resort beach. All of Shimoda will be like Waikiki! Daddy, that's amazing! Yay to the resort development! You finally understand me now! I can't just sit around here like this. Tetsuya-kun and they misunderstood it. I must hurry and let them know! Daddy, what's this all about? I've put my life on the line for this development project. I will never allow you to date the son of a man who is trying to slow down our construction plans. I don't want to! Daddy, even if you oppose, I will not break up with him! I will break the two of you up whether you like it or not! Reiko, you with a fisherman's son? Unsuitable match! I'm already twenty years old. I will choose for myself who I decide to date. Zendouji, move out of the way! Miss, please forgive me! Zendouji! Zendouji! - Miss! - Move out of the way! - Zendouji! Daddy is in the wrong, isn't he? - Please, Miss. - Come on, Zendouji! - Miss, I'm terribly sorry! - What are your thoughts? - Hang on! - Come on, please! - Zendouji! Open the door! Open up, I say! Come on! Zendouji, come on! Open the door! Come on! Open the door! Tetsuya-kun, will I never see you again? Tetsuya-kun! The two of us are so in love with each other, but we've been torn apart due to our families' situation. It's as if we are Romeo and Juliet. Yes, that's right. I'm Juliet! I'm the damsel in distress! By going against our parents' wishes, our love for each other intensifies! Reiko-san! Tetsuya-kun, you've come to save me! I'm coming to rescue you now. If we are together, we can overcome any obstacle. Why are you so courageous? Please take me away from here! My Romeo! My Tetsuya-kun! How were they, the Shiratori Group? Everything is going according to plan. I don't see any problems. This may have been too easy of a task for you. Yes. However, I was able to meet a rich girl who was kind of interesting. Hey! Where'd my smartphone go? I'll hold onto it until you give up on that girl. Father, are you being serious? Dear, there's no need to go that far. No can do! Going to see her is also forbidden. We're going out for a bit. You're absolutely not allowed to leave the house. I can't make that kind of promise! I figured as much. I got someone to come keep watch over you. Someone to keep watch over me? There you are! Uncle, leave it to me! - Alright! - What? Hey! - Wait a minute. - Old man! - Have a good day! - Tetsuya, you can't come outside. - Hey! Timing and Subtitles brought by The Reiko Rules Team @ Viki Are you really going to keep watch over me? Uncle did ask me to, after all. Fine. Then I'll go get some tea. No can do. I'll go get it for you, so sit down. Where are you heading off to? I-I was thinking of doing some running at the beach. - I want to exercise a bit before the basketball training camp. - But— Please! I'll definitely return before my father and the others get back. I guess it can't be helped then. Only for a bit, though! Don't get in the way of development! Hey, what are you doing? Because you guys are against it, they can't move forward with construction! - If a hotel gets built, we locals will be able to profit from it, too! - Get out if you're against it! - Leave Shimoda if you don't like the development! Cowards, show yourselves! Rumi, are you okay? Tetsuya, how could you let a girl get hurt before she's even married? Sorry. It's not Tetsuya's fault. Those who are in favor of the development are the ones at fault. How worrisome. How much longer is this going to continue? I'll apologize to your family about this, so eat before you go, okay? Here, put these away. Thank you very much. Maybe it would've been better if I hadn't gone to an all-girl's high school. Was it not fun? No, thanks to the home economics course, I learned to make sweets. But... But what? I just think maybe three years was a little too long. Dear, what's going on? Why are there so many? They said they can't buy fish from a fishing association that's against the development. Damn it! At this rate, we'll lose our livelihood! Isn't that being too much? Looks like we'll have to give up on taking the boat out tomorrow. Is Tetsuya-kun really not going to come and visit? Not even a phone call? None, Miss. It's been as many as 18 hours! Why won't you come save me? Aren't you worried about me? Could it be? - Is it good? - Yeah, it's good. Forget about being Juliet! Hurry and let me out! Tetsuya-kun. Hello, Uzumaki-san? Please put Reiko-san on the phone. I decline. Don't tell Miss. Understood? Yes, sir. Nothing abnormal as of yet. I believed we'd be happy as long as we liked each other. I believed that, but... Miss, it'd be best if you went to bed now. Uzumaki, anything from Tetsuya-kun? Nothing in particular. Uzumaki, how many years should I wait? The more I wait, the more I feel I won't be able to see him again. You know, when I'm reborn, I'm going to learn how to cook and get Tetsuya-kun to say it's delicious. Cleaning, too. I'll do it perfectly... I'll bring you some warm milk. After drinking it, you'll be able to fall fast asleep. Hey, get this. I'm so sick of my parents driving me around like a slave. They tell me to deliver vegetables on days I don't have class. Hey, Tetsuya, won't you help me? There's this much! I'm not really in the mood right now. Is something wrong? Hey, Rumi, I've got a favor to ask. [Shiratori Residence: Matsutake mushrooms, saffron...] I'm from Masuda Plantation. I've come to deliver vegetables. Thank you for your hard work. Nothing abnormal. Go ahead. Hey, wait! The list, please. I'm so sorry! Go ahead. It'll be okay if you enter from the back. Thanks, Rumi. We only asked for vegetables, Miss Masuda Plantation. - Uncle, over there! - What? Go, Tetsuya! Wait! There's an intruder! Uzumaki-san! Uzumaki-san. Up there! Hurry! The Miss' room! Tetsuya-kun! - They're getting away! - Go after them! Tetsuya-kun, this way! Stop! - Wait! - Stop! - Wait! - Stop! Tetsuya-kun, you took so long to come! I wanted to save you sooner but couldn't. Sorry. I've finally got it. Whether it's the resort development or dispute between our parents, none of them matter. What's really important is how we feel. Tetsuya-kun, about that, - don't worry. That resort development is actually amazing! - What? If a hotel is built, lots of people will come, right? They'll be able to sell a lot of fish, too! Everyone will benefit from it, so it's good for everyone! What are you saying, construction? The ocean is a fisherman's life. We'll be able to drink tropical drinks while looking at that ocean! Isn't it wonderful? Reiko-san, have you been deceived by your father? Your father only thinks about making money! Don't say bad things about my father! You don't even know anything about him! You, too! You also don't understand how important the ocean is to a fisherman, do you? Well, of course I don't understand anything about fishing! But isn't it a happy thing if a resort gets made and yields profits? All rich people are like that! I don't understand you, Reiko-san. It's been a while. Oh. Hey, you'll give me a lift in your car, right? Me, right now? You're more willful than rumors say you are. What in the world? Here is fine. Stop the car. Is it okay? He's still watching. Those guys on the opposing side are getting worked up, too. If you're caught walking around a bad place, who knows what will happen to you? President Shiratori is also looking for you in a frenzy. I'll send you home. I'm not returning home! Is that so? In that case, let's go to my hotel. In this situation, you— Don't get the wrong idea. If anything happens to you, my business deal with President Shiratori will be over. If the Shiratori Group stops working for me now, I'll suffer a heavy loss. As expected of Kiryu-san, whose life depends on money. If that's the case, then why don't I send you where President Shiratori is? It's this way. What is this place? Isn't this your room? Get me another room! Who would think that there's a woman in the room of someone like me, who's only interested in business? Don't you think it's safest here, Miss? Use it as you please. Reiko-san, it's Yoshimoto. Reiko-san, you're beautiful today as well. I'm sorry, Smirky-snob... I mean, Yoshimoto-san. I called you here so suddenly. But there just wasn't anyone else I could rely on. Please. If it's something for your sake, it's no problem at all. I've done some research on the construction. So the construction is really getting delayed because of the people who oppose it? About that, according to the real estate division at my company, only one landowner hasn't complied with the land acquisition, so they can't start the construction. Then it's not Tetsuya-kun's parents' fault? No, it isn't. By making those in opposition look like the bad guys, they're making the other residents of Shimoda their allies with the intention of pushing forward the development by getting people worked up over the issue. No way. Where is the land that hasn't been acquired yet? It's right here. This is Grandma Bell's house? Do you know this place? Know it? It's a memorable place for Tetsuya-kun and me. Hey, Yoshimoto-san. This means that if we encourage Grandma Bell not to sell her land, the resort development plan will vanish, right? Most likely. If that happens, the opposition movement will disappear, and the discord between the Shiratori and Akimoto families will also disappear! And at last, Tetsuya-kun and I will... I must let Tetsuya-kun know! Yoshimoto-san, I ran away with another man in the middle of a marriage meeting with you. Yes, the wound in my heart hasn't healed yet. Even so, why are you treating me so well? It's simple. Seeing you become happy is the happiest thing for me. Reiko-san, I, Yoshimoto, am happy for some reason right now. It's my first time knowing this kind of love also exists. Please! Please give us this piece of land! I want to make Shimoda Japan's number one resort spot! That's actually not the only thing, right? What do you mean? Yoshi-boy, it's amazing that you've made it this far with nothing but yourself despite being poor. I admire you. Thank you very much. Isn't that enough, hurting the town you were born and raised in anymore than this? Do you really want money that badly? I'll come again! Did you fail again? Please hurry. Once I'm done here, I have a development project waiting for me in Dubai. I deeply apologize. Please wait just a little longer. Tetsuya, so this is where you were? Where's Reiko-san? Say, Rumi, are you against the development of a resort? Of course! Uncle's fishing industry may be snatched away. Would you be able to tolerate something like that? I heard a lot of tourists will come and everyone will be able to reap profits. It was Reiko-san, huh? Tetsuya, don't tell me you're starting to support it? If my father and the others' ocean disappears, I'm opposed to the resort development. But that will become the reason for breaking up with Reiko-san. Tetsuya? I don't know what to do anymore! Tetsuya, you won't be happy even if you end up with her. She's too different from us! Am I not an okay choice? Forget Reiko-san and be together with me. I like you, Tetsuya! I want to be with you forever! The resort development will be stopped! So we can tie the knot together, Tetsuya-kun! Why is... Tetsuya-kun... (hugging) that person? Why? Why, Tetsuya-kun? I'm sorry, Rumi. I finally understood just now. I can't be with anyone but Reiko-san. You won't get excused just because you like her, Tetsuya. I know. If they start the development, then (your family) won't be able to fish anymore! Is that okay with you?! I see... That's right! That might actually work! Thank you, Rumi! Yes. Chairman, about the acquisition... To be honest, it seems like it may fall slightly behind. Idiot! You still haven't acquired it yet? If that's the case, then I won't be able to leave you in charge of the Dubai project. Yes, I deeply apologize. Every company has their eye on rights to the first casino in Japan. If the ban on casinos gets lifted, it'll be a scale of one hundred million yen in the market. We absolutely cannot fall behind. Yes, I understand. The political world is currently laying the groundwork for legal reform. Once the land acquisition process is over, we still have to level down the mountains and fill up the ocean to reclaim land... In order to construct an enormous facility, There's a huge pile of things that have to be done! [Casino (black), Resort Hotel (red)] I am fully aware. Please wait for a little while, Chairman. Casino? Both Daddy and Tetsuya-kun's father have been tricked, I see! - Miss! - Miss! - Daddy! - Reiko! Where have you been? Call off the resort development. Are you still saying those things? No! Daddy, you've been tricked! Their true goal is to build a casino in Shimoda, and they plan to level the mountains and fill in the ocean! And also, also, something about laying groundwork for "Hokkaido..." Reiko, it's not Hokkaido, but "houkaisei." (legal reform) That's right! Legal reform... Wait, why do you know this, Daddy? D-Don't tell me... Yes, I knew about the casino from the start. Even though you knew, why... do you want to ruin the nature that we have in Shimoda? I kept quiet about it, but actually, the business hasn't been doing well for a few years now. If I didn't hurry and get a loan from somewhere, - Shiratori Group would fall into crisis. - What? We've already been rejected by all the banks. The only thing left is to rely on Kiryu-kun's loan! That person isn't interested in anything but money! He may be planning to usurp your company! That may be true, but... There's no other choice right now. I, too... want to protect the nature of Shimoda, the town where I was born and raised. But I can't let the 10,000 employees of Shiratori Group be left to wander the streets. Daddy... Please understand, Reiko. Call off the development and still provide a loan to Shiratori Group? What a convenient favor to ask on your end. I know that... but there's no one I can ask but you! Even if you bow down, it's not worth even one yen, because the only thing I'm interested in is business. Please! Can't you do something about it? There's a condition. If you want me to call off the development... What is it? Don't waste time, hurry and say it! Marry me. That's the condition. W-Why? The know-how that Shiratori Group has cultivated, as well as its network is truly superb, and.... if I marry their only daughter, I'll be the next president. You would marry for something like that? Something like that? To me, marriage is also considered business. If you marry me, I'll give a loan to Shiratori Group. Are you being serious? Reiko-san! I've been looking for you! Tetsuya-kun... Why? Reiko-san, isn't there a way for everyone to be happy? What do you mean? There's a way to do the development while also protecting the ocean. Take a look at this. - At the beach over here, you can't swim even in the summer. - What? The waves are rough, so it's not suited for swimming. Then, what about here? Uzumaki said something about it before. She said the sandy beach is pretty and the view is also amazing. Would it be lovely to enjoy tropical drinks here? That sounds great. This is a secret spot that only the locals know. [Location for Hotel] How about building a hotel here? [Location for Hotel] But... The station is a little far... We can just make a new path. I see! Then, right here... We can't build it here. There are wasabi fields here. Wasabi relies on clean water to grow. A place we can build a path... would be here, I guess? Although, it's a bit of a detour. The cherry blossoms on that street are pretty! You're right! [Cherry Blossom Street] Then, what about building a viewing platform here? Looking at the sunset is the most romantic thing! [Viewing Platform] I think that's a good idea. Also, the port over here. The fishing ports unload their catch here, but right next to it, there's a huge patch of land. A restaurant! They can eat freshly-caught fish there! [Restaurant for Freshly-caught Fish] Count me in! If that's the plan, then I'll let you take care of my land. Hey, Kiryu-san, take a look at this! We came up with a great idea! It's an even better plan than building something like a casino! So, please! Give up on the casino, and give a loan to my daddy! This is the business plan that's even better than a casino? Yes, that's right! Here you go! I'll treat it as this never existed. Hey, wait. Just listen to me! First, this place. Without taking the effort to make a private beach, there's an even better, all-natural beach! If you make a hotel here, then you'll save on construction costs, won't you? Looking out from your room, the sunset you see on the horizon will look absolutely beautiful, too! And, over here! There's a street lined with cherry blossom trees. [Cherry blossom viewing spot!] There's more than a hundred trees in bloom there, and it's really beautiful when they're all in bloom! Also, at the mountain next to it, you can gather lots of mushrooms! At night, the night view is extremely beautiful, and if you're lucky, there will be a ton of fireflies flying around! Also, the ocean becomes really transparent, so that thing... taking a walk in the sea? That's right, that. That would be like taking a walk with the fish, isn't it? Have you finally awoken, Miss? Um... What about the business plan from yesterday? You mean this thing that looks like an elementary schooler's wall poster? I worked hard writing all that up! Good morning. Good morning. - I read it, the new resort plan. - What? Thank you very much. Not destroying everything and starting from scratch, [Shimoda District New Resort Plan/Making a town while making the best use of its nature] but making the resort while utilizing the town's unique characteristics, huh? Yes, sir. The local color, views, temperature, water, and wind. By using these to their greatest potential, not only will construction costs be greatly reduced, we'll also be able to make it an even more pleasant resort experience. If it gets completed, it will be able to revitalize the economy here in the long-term, and continue to bring profit to our company as well. Even if there's no casino to attract tourists. A plan that's looking at the long-term, huh? It's not bad. Thank you very much. Yay! Then you'll be willing to give us a loan with this, right? But, it's naive. Too naive. Do you plan to just watch and pass on the profits from building a casino and let another company do it? However, Chairman... The casino business has been our life-long dream. For the benefit of the local residents? Being environmentally friendly? This isn't like you. Roll out the casino plans according to schedule. I understand. I will do as you say. As long as you understand. Why? You also thought that this plan was very good. And that's why you even drafted documents like this. Are you going to do everything according to what your parents tell you? Are you your parent's puppet? Say what you want! If the Chairman has made the decision I cannot follow through with the plans. Then what about the investment? So I guess there's no other way than for me to marry you. Reiko-san! How did it go? Our resort development plans. They were very interested in it. Really? Yes! There was something I wanted to tell you if those plans went well. What is it? Reiko-san, let's get married. I've come to realize something very important from this experience. That no matter what happens, I want to be with you, Reiko-san. Tetsuya-kun, are you sure? Timing and Subtitles brought by The Reiko Rules Team @ Viki Just for one day... for one day. Can I think it over? Tomorrow evening at 6 pm, I will answer you here. [Akimoto Tetsuya] [Tetsuya] ♫ That view I'd grown accustomed to has never changed ♫ ♫ That kindness that wrapped itself around us ♫ ♫ We fought over trivial matters, but ♫ ♫ Now, those are all precious memories ♫ ♫ If we stick to our love ♫ ♫ It should come true, or so I believed ♫ ♫ It should come true, or so I believed ♫ ♫ If "goodbye" isn't our answer ♫ ♫ Let me hear it with that beloved voice of yours ♫ ♫ Even if we choose and start walking on different paths ♫ ♫ Our hearts will not separate ♫ ♫ One more time, one more time ♫ ♫ I want to see you again, one more time ♫ You're getting married? Yes. Dad, Mom, I am getting married. I won't give you my blessings. You're marrying that fisherman's son, aren't you? I will not allow it! The person I'm marrying is Kiryu General's Kiryu Kiichi-san. Reiko-chan! Congratulations! I actually had a premonition. I kind of saw the red string connecting you together. Kiryu-san will be coming over to greet you. Honey, this is wonderful. Then Reiko-san, you're getting married for money with someone you don't even love? I won't allow it. Please wait, Tetsuya-sama. She is sacrificing herself with the intention of saving the Shiratori family. She is the type of person who cannot silently sit still and watch (her father) become unhappy. Tetsuya-sama, you would know best. Young madam is taking it the hardest. You'd like to have the wedding next Sunday? The Shimoda Development Project will be cancelled and I plan to fly to Dubai as soon as possible. I'd like to have the wedding ceremony out of the way before then. Cancelling the development project? What do you mean by that? If we plan to develop the casino, that old lady said that she will not sell her property if her life depended on it. If we cannot build the casino then we have no choice but to consider the contract null and void. Well then, how about the investment to Shiratori Group? Of course we will proceed with our investment because we will become one family. Did you know? Reiko-san... Is there any other girl that cares for you this much? There's no one else out there like her. Tetsuya, make the decision for yourself. Reiko-san getting married? What's that all about? Takada? We heard! What's this about her engagement with a son from a distinguished family? - Hurry and go stop them already! - Because it's you, you're in your room sitting on the fence again, aren't you? If we don't give you a push from behind, you won't be able to do anything. That's why we came here all the way for you! They have massive heavy security. I heard that it was top secret just among family but with heavy security like this, they're actually publicizing themselves. Where can we get in from? We have no choice but to jump the gates. Let's show them our basketball team work! I said keep quiet! Sorry! You're so lame. Why don't you ever rely on me? Rumi! Well... but... Don't be so hesitant. We're buddies, right? Yah. Were you guys planning on entering from the front? You'd be kicked out for sure! But... there aren't any other entrances. Tetsuya, get in! Why did we come here? You went and cancelled the casino plans without permission. I'm so sorry. However, I was successful in getting my hands on the Shiratori Group. Although through overbearing means. Don't mess up the next Dubai project. Yes. So beautiful! Reiko-chan is so pretty! Excuse me, I'm here to deliver the vegetables. Okay, you can enter. Over here. Over here! The reception hall is straight ahead. What's the matter? Come on! I'm sure everything will work out! If it doesn't, I'll take you in. Don't worry and get going! Thank you, Rumi. Groom Kiryu Kiichi, for better or for worse will you love this person till death do you part? Do you swear to sincerely follow these vows? I do. Bride Shiratori Reiko, do you swear? Do you swear? Reiko-san! - Tetsuya-kun? - Reiko-san! Reiko-san, please come with me. But... - Father. - You! I don't have any money and I have no skills to show for but no one can beat my love for Reiko-san. I beg you to please allow me to take Reiko-san away with me. Can you really be happy like that? You love her? Do you really think you can make her happy? It wouldn't be possible if it's only myself thinking this way but if we are both thinking the same of each other, I can guarantee that we will be happy, for sure. The both of you? I'm sorry, Tetsuya-san. - I can't go with you. - What? Is that your true feeling? - Come on, let's go! - Let go of me! Reiko-san! Let go of me! Let go of me! Hey, let go of me! - Reiko-san! - Hey! Reiko-san, Reiko-san, Reiko-san! Get out of here! Let go of me! Reiko-san! Tetsuya! - Reiko-san! - Calm down, Man! Reiko-san! Let go of him! Well, then, let's continue. Then, it is time to exchange rings. Come... over... here... Reiko... Daddy! It's devastating to lose my business but making you unhappy, Reiko, is much more devastating than that! Daddy... but... I will start all over again and build the company from scratch. I've found something to keep me entertained for when I get old. Thank you, Daddy! I want to be with Tetsuya-kun, too. I want to become happy with Tetsuya-kun. Kiichi-kun, this is how it is. I'm so sorry! I understand. Marriage aside, I will invest in your company. However, I have one condition. I will get you to promote the new resort project. Kiichi, what are you talking about? You've been made a laughing stock at your own wedding but you're still going to invest in them? I will not allow you to do that! No, I will do it! Chairman, that new development project is amazing from a business perspective. If we were to join forces with Shiratori Group, we will definitely succeed. Please believe in me! Do what you want. Are you sure? Thank you very much! However, I will not give up on the casino. I will find another location for the casino and when that happens, don't make a mistake, okay? Yes. Kiryu-san, thank you. Don't misunderstand. I've simply made the decision from a business perspective. Get away from him! Tetsuya-kun! Is that Reiko's voice? Tetsuya-kun! Reiko-san! Tetsuya-kun! I want to be with you too, Tetsuya-kun! I want to find happiness with you, Tetsuya-kun. Reiko-san. Groom Akimoto Tetsuya for better or for worse will you continue to love this person until death do you part? Do you swear to sincerely follow these vows? I do! Bride Shiratori Reiko, do you swear? I do! - Yay! - Congratulations! Congratulations! Did we make the right decision? Yes, dear, you're never wrong. You are an awkward type of person, aren't you. What do you mean by that? If you wanted to take over Shiratori Group, you could have purchased the majority of their shares and acquired them. Why did you go to the extent of having to marry Reiko-san? Well, that's because... You should have honestly confessed your feelings and said, "Reiko-san, I've fallen in love with you so please marry me." It's hard to handle women. It's much easier to handle money. I agree. By the way, I have an interesting business opportunity. I'll hear about it over there. Congratulations! Daddy, Mommy, thank you. Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! See, I told you! If you look, you'll know. Thank you to the Reiko Rules Team including our Channel Manager: bagy, our Chief Editor: mjkrech and our General Editor: cr1msonreigns, Reiko-san, I love you! I am the world renowned Shiratori Reiko. With the love of my life, Tetsuya-kun, we will create the the world's best family!
