Let's go. It's feeding time, yank. Time's up. You can come out now. I say your time's up. Your 30 day holiday is up, yank. Get him out of there. Stand up, here. Leave him be. I could drop you rats right here, you know? My time in the box was up two days ago. Your time's up when I say your time's up. You want your damn time up, huh? Don't scare you none at all, does it? Gettin' shot. How about goin' back in the box? Now that don't sit none too well, now does it? Huh? Say it. You say it or by god, you go right back in that box. I mean it. Say it! Say it! Luke, Joe, help that man right back up in that box. Please. What? Please. What? What'd you say? Please don't put me back in the box. “Please don't put me back in that box." Damn, I don't think we made a believer out of this boy. You can go. Don't let me see you fixing to skip outta here again. You hear me? I'll clap you back in that box I so much see you looking at them walls. Hey, son! Ain't you gonna take your friend with ya? ♪ long live glory ♪ ♪ long live victory ♪ ♪ long live glory ♪ ♪ long live victory ♪ Mulvey. - Mulvey. - What? - Hey, you're out. - Mm-hmm. - You get the dynamite? - Yes, yes. How about the cigar? Yeah. Is that what you had in mind, is it? That'll do. Oh, the fuse cost me more than I figured it would and the letters cost me. How much did you get for my boots? Callahan. Today's the day, you know. I know. “Lieutenant Harrison Tibbit, officer of the union army has been judged guilty of attempted escape from this military prison and the murder while on unlawful flight of a patriotic southern civilian citizen who attempted to apprehend and return such escaping prisoner. - “Penalty is execution." - No, no! "Under-" - no, no, no, no, no! - No, no, no, no! - "Under wartime statute to the confederate states of America accordingly it is the sentence of the comadante of this military prison" no, no, no, no!

Signed, John Henry winder, brigadier general, camp hook military prison, “ no, no, no, no, no! - "August 6th, 1864." - No, no, no, no! May god have mercy on your soul. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Silent! You lost your man. - No, no, no, no! - Ready? No, no, no, no, no! - Aim! - No, no, no, no, no! Fire! Hey, hey, colonel. I got a box of letters belonging to lieutenant Tibbet. Can I put it in with him? All right, but be quick about it. Thank you, sir. All right, soldier, that'll do. Sergeant! Hey, what are you doing there? Come on, let's go. Back to your colonel! Move back! Shoot if you have to! Here you go. Oh, thank you. Bags will be at the hotel. Are you staying on here? Well, for the time being. I'm on no schedule. Get there eventually. Colonel Mountford, sir. Best of luck. And to you too, Mr. Duffy. Hey, macho. Been a long time. Well I got beer, Brandy. One now, one later. Hey, macho. You go away and I don't know if you get shot or what. And then you come back and you don't even say, "hey, Juan." Hey, Juan. Hey, macho. Can I ask you a question? Where you been now for a year? Pfison? Uh-huh. Honey, I knew why you were so shy and different when - you came home. - You did? Of course, the war. All you could think about was your arms, silly. That's why I wasn't a bit put off by all your excuses. I just wanted things to be ready for you. The past is past. We're married and happy, and we'll have a marvelous, happy life together. If I can trust you. Trust me? To undo the two top buttons on my dress. Only the top two. I promise nothing. I had no idea I had such an uncontrollable. It's no more than you can expect when you dash off with a man you've only known since childhood. Honey, I've lost old battles in less time than that. I shall require 40 minutes and 10 seconds for a shave and a bath at the local barbershop. Now if you think you can accomplish whatever it is you have to do across the hall in the genuine marble tub in approximately the same time. Yes, sir. He's closed. So what'll it be? Bar whiskey, beer or something fancy? Whiskey's fine. You stock champagne. Well, I don't know. Got one bottle. I don't know what year it is. But this belongs to another fella. How much does he pay? Why you think I'm trying to work you for the extra dollar? Make a price. It's important to me. He'd bust my head. He knows I only had two bottles. Is this enough? Now don't let him see ya. By Joe, he's gonna yell. Hey. Hey, mister. Hey. You left with my bottle. Now you gonna bring it back? Your argument isn't with me. You keep walking I'm gonna shoot you right between the shoulder blades and take a chance the bottle don't break when it hits the ground. The bartender has been well paid. If you have something to say, say it to him. Hey! When you get to that gun, make up your mind one way or another. Let me make it clear. I do not respond to threats. David! Oh, help! He's dead, misses. You and you. I'm gonna save as both a lot of trouble, sheriff. - No! - You seen him - go for the gun. - Yeah. He reached for it first, all right. Is that the way you saw it? Yep. You seen it was my bottle he took. That's right. It was his bottle. Anybody see it different? Good morning, Mr. Duffy. I came as soon as I got your note. I've come on my own here. I didn't think you'd want to see anyone just yet. We're all very sorry. We're honored to have known colonel, colonel. - Mountford. - Colonel Mountford. Yeah. Will you help me? I don't know anyone else around here. Here's David's money. Would you pay these people, please? The judge says they can't do anything to that man. How is that possible? Huh? Oh, he's long gone, miss. But someone had the influence or the money to free him. Miss Mountford. My husband was my whole world, Mr. Duffy. If we were going to tree that man, how would we go about it? We get off letters to the authorities and talk to some lawmen. Who is this man? We go through all this for what? The man I'm looking for is the one that got me put in prison. He planned to be a remount dealer for the army. Offered to buy 600 horses from me. He gave me this paper to sign. I thought it was a bill of sale. So I put my Mark to it. Found out it was enlistment papers. The authorities gave me a choice. Go to war or go to prison. Well, it wasn't my war. You know, for the $25 more or less he got for recruiting me... I spent a year, winter and summer, with rats and red ants feeding off of me. Will we follow him all the way to California? If need be. You'll know this man when you see him, huh? Well I couldn't miss that dude a mile off. His name's Duffy. And he's got a real liking for yellow shoes. Alexandra. Alexandra. Who is it? Telegram, Alexandra. Good news. Here, read it. Yes, but... All right. I'm coming. Here. Read it aloud. I didn't get a chance to look it over in the post office. "Concerning macho Callahan." The original charge is desertion. Prisoner was confined in camp hook military prison from which he escaped July 12th, 1864. Several members of the Texas reserves were killed in his escape. Two officers were injured and property belonging to the confederate states of America was damaged. The charge is wartime desertion and murder. A $150 reward will be forthcoming upon his delivery to any army post. "Signed, brigadier general John Henry winder." Ah, these were in the post office. Ah, they're in the territories now. You'll have to get them into confederate jurisdiction. Say Texas. And there are two of them, Callahan and a Mexican. And nobody in his right mind going take 'em both for only $150. Raise the reward to a thousand dollars. I'll post the money with the authorities in the morning. How far to fort ray? From here? Mm, about 200 miles more or less. This stuff is hot! Well that's where he's gonna go. He makes his living in cards and gambling. Hit the cowhands clean so he figures he's gonna... Hit the soldiers next. Texas is not a good idea for you, macho. There are too many soldiers. That's very dangerous. Well that's where we're going. The dumbest saddle bronc in new mex knows better how to treat a lady than you do. Why you just don't know how to show a lady any attention at all, now do ya? You don't even know how to be nice to a lady. As a matter of fact, I think maybe I'm just wasting my time with you. I'm perfectly away why you want to go to fort ray. Soldiers gamble pretty freely, don't they, Duffy? The money you gave me is long gone. That and the rest. We've been to all the logical places. Now it's time I turn to what I know. I know pretty much why you don't wanna quit. You don't wanna go home losers. Hell, honey, I make my living off men with that philosophy. They never go home winners. If you was to call in your end of the reward money, something we could work with. There's $850 sitting with the authorities doing not a wit of good to man or beast. The reward stays. That's the last money you're gonna take off me. "Well if you can't stand the heat, "get out of the griddle," as the man says. Who need any fun? You got one. Hey, macho. All right. Hey, macho. I found a game over there and I was... Sick. The name of the game is horseshoes. Put the iron shoe around that little stake out there and get yourself three points and world fame. What'll we play for? Straight dollar a point. Partners split. Any side action's up to you. How's $5 a point? All right. We got it. Why don't you go first, Duffy? Good little town. It seems it. You don't leave a man much. Ah, figure a man should go after the tough one. Play a force in game. Do onto others before they do onto you, right? That's the idea. Maybe I should have stuck to mother when I go out to play. Now there was a game I was good at. You're a card player. Oh yeah, cards, pool playing, hop scotch. Gambling your business? Oh, iordy no, I do government work. Is that right? I'll make it one brush. How about you? What kind of work you been doin'? Recovering work. Sergeant! Hey, sergeant. - Coffee. - Oh goddamn, anyhow! If I got to clean it one more time, I'm gonna take to preaching instead. You know all the words really? You ever stop to wonder if she might be leveling with us? That'd be funny we come to find out that there was no thousand dollar reward. She just wanted us to take care of some man friend. - Women do that. - Yeah, for this long, it wouldn't be funny. We puttin' up here for the night, are we ma'am? No time. He's only an hour ahead of us. We'll catch up with him tonight. Lord be praised. Come on. Keep up. Come on! And then I arrived here at this gambling house. I should be in Houston in eight or nine days if this little lady here don't hold me up too much. Now look, honey, I've been lucky at the tables down there for two days. How's the letter writing business? - Bore all day. - Aye, not so bad. Damn site less than 50 or 60 a week two months ago. Well, the letter writing was good enough for a while. It's just run its course. 1600. Well, I can remember when it wasn't but 1150. Make up your mind or something. You spin like circum. Did I ever think to mention to you there were easier ways to come by money to stick on that reward offer? You mentioned. You know, I could be talked into going after that fella myself. It wouldn't cost you nothing either. I got to go over to Jimmy's for a while. Mind the store for me, would ya? Howdy, misses. Howdy, Harry. Who are you writing a letter on? Evening, yancy. You're number five customer today. See you later, honey. Well, you'll find an extra 10 cents in there when you go to counting. Got me a raise today. I'm proud of you, yancy. You deserved it. Yes, 'em. It... Four already today, huh? That's right. Mm-hmm. All of 'em asked you upstairs, I expect. Just three, but there were a few others who didn't even pretend they wanted me to write letters. Dear mom, well it was another hot one today. Me and petey, we started out... How's it going? Hey, macho. I never seen one like that. He's all over gold. He's a golden god. Looking to get knocked over the head. I think he's beautiful. Gee. Mr. Tibble said as I had done my job real good. So he gave me a dollar a week raise. Mr. Tibble will likely snatch them bulls he gets wind of it. Well, anyway. My god. Is something wrong, misses? Yancy, you see that man down there at table two. The one with a beard facing us. Go down there and see that he doesn't get away until Harry gets back. Well sure, but what'd he do, insult you or something? Yes, hurry. Don't let anybody leave table two. Called it. Bill, go over to Jimmy's and get Harry right away. Give me three. One. I'll take one. Mister. You! I understand you insulted the lady. Well she says you did. It's not possible. I never met a lady. Well you met this one. There she is right over there. If I don't remember meeting the lady, I damn sure don't remember insulting her. $4. I think you better stand up, mister. I just assume not. - All righty. - Hey, hold on, yancy. That fella will likely hurt ya. Yancy! Harry, over here! The man who killed my husband, Callahan. Stop him! There he is over there! Don't let him get away! Stop! Hey, you! Hold it right there! It's the letter writing lady. She stays pretty good. How far are you going? Farther than this. Hey, macho, she takes the gold man's ring. Hey. How come you said I insulted ya? The boy made a mistake. You don't need to make up that bunk. We'll use this one. Well now are you one of them that's gotta be told you got real pretty eyes or some damn thing? Do you remember a place called junction city? You killed a man there... For a bottle of champagne. His name was David Mountford. If you say so. He was my husband! Hey, macho. She followed me across Texas... Halfway across new Mexico... Because I killed her husband. She really tried to kill you, huh? Is she dead? I don't think so. Man, I better go inside and help her. Juan. Yeah. Go do what you can for her. Your head is still bleeding. And you're hair, I'm... I'm sorry, senorita. Why didn't he kill me? I don't know. Funny. Get the traps and set a line. That will take many days. So what? Are we not going to felicidad? Later. What about her? Give me a hand with the traps. Macho. What about her? Look after her. And don't touch her. And you tell the guard to put up his hands. If he doesn't... You shoot him. But you must never shoot the stagecoach driver because then the horses will run away. What is it? Oh, well... Why? Why? Well, all these things, I tell you... And all the things I know. The people that steal men's wallets in the alley. The cheating at cards. And the stealing of horses. You're a very nice lady who, who can write beautiful letters. And can perhaps teach me many good things. So instead I teach you... Stealing of horses. It's funny, no? Your stories are marvelous. They helped me to know you better. Know me? Me and macho? No, never. You see, up here is not the place to really understand. Here is to understand. You're a very nice lady. Why don't you go home? Have a nice, beautiful life. And maybe a piano. Juan! Bead Juan, beafl... Now take it easy, pal. Get a rope! Come on. Come on. Why? He can't make it on his own. We're gonna take him to felicidad. Where is felicidad? It's in the desert. What do you do there? It's in the canyon. A couple of thousand of acres of good grass. Good. Water. Tell her what you do. Go hunting a while. Drink with your friends. And you go and visit Consuelo Rodriguez. Two or three times. It lasts four or five days. Like always. Think I'll go to bed. You come and go as you please. Got enough water? Two canteens. Biscuits. Some meat. Plenty for a little trip like that. How's the horse? Shoes okay. Saddle, okay. Blanket, okay. I even asked the horse how he feels today. And he said, "bien." Are you all right? I'm fine. I don't have money for the stage. Train. Of course, Harry's place is no good for ya. I know that. And you keep going until you get to where you know the people. - It's a nice pl... well, I... Go on. I'd like to hear what you have to say. Well just that it's a nice place, felicidad. I'm sorry about your husband. But the darn thing had to be, you understand? What's that for? Nothing. It belongs to Harry. Well I don't want it. I don't want it either. Well then why don't you sell it? Why don't you, it's stolen? I told you I don't want the damn thing! I don't want it either. Give it to your friends in felicidad. Why don't you? You're coming with me. Bad being of a family of 12, senorita. Especially when there's food only enough for two of them. Look, she don't wanna hear that. Oh, but this time, myself and my papa, and my brother, we go all the way to San Sebastian. And we start feeding eight horses from the. She don't care about stuff like that. We leave in the morning. First light. Why'd you ask me to come with you? I don't know. Just wanted to see how it was with you. I never asked anyone to be with me before. Now you saw that book. Never learned no reading. So I got no idea what you're supposed to say when you're like this. I know you're supposed to say something. Like some damn thing like you got pretty eyes or something. I know that. Alexandra. Is that what they call ya? Alexandra. Sometimes Alex. My brother called me Alex. You all right, Alex? Tired, hungry, anything? Fine. Felicidad. Come here. Come on, come here, big baby. Come here, big baby. It's us they follow. Huh! Come on! Hold your fire! Alexandra! Alexandra! It's me, Harry! I wanna come up there and talk to you! Both of you! You come out half way, I'll come out half way. Well come ahead! Harry, first off, you say she's all right. All right, come ahead. We agreed to meet halfway. You agreed! You all right, honey? I'm not being kept a prisoner, Harry. Thank you for everything you tried to do for me. You don't wanna come back? The reward. I wanna withdraw it. It's not that easy, honey. See, the reward is good and there's 15 to 20 men out there to claim it. If I swore to them, I'd give them the money. No, they wouldn't believe you. They trust you, Harry. Would you try? Maybe you should have gone with them. Harry. Well what, where? How come she ain't with ya? She staying with him. But she wouldn't... Well was it her own freewill? - Freewill, Harry? - Yancy! She's a woman. No more. Just a woman. And what she wants is him. Coming? Callahan! No need to let the lady get hurt! We'll be in to get you at sunrise. Harry thinks I'm insane. Well most women I can think of... Given the choice wouldn't choose to sit behind a rock getting shot at. Hell, it's easy. 18 or 19 of us. $1,600. That's something more than $88 and change a piece. Maybe we ought to think about letting them go. Are you serious? That's three months pay, boy. How much time do we have left? A nano. Till then, sunrise. It'll have to do us. Hey, Josh. Time to change the lookout? No need, boy. Remember how Juan was always talking down felicidad? When it came time to leave, he was always the one dragging his feet. Listen, I don't mean much to you yet. But you see, not many people ride in there with us. You said something once about finding heaven. Well I guess that's what felicidad is. It's good. It's always good. On the hill's wild. It's a good place, felicidad.
