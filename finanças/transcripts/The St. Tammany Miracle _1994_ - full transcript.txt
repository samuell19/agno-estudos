Have mercy upon me and answer me. When thou said, seek ye my face, my heart said unto Thee, Thy face Lord, will I seek. The gospel of the Lord. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, You sent Your own Son into this world. We thank You for the lives of these children entrusted to our care, that we are all Your children. And so to love and nurture them that they may attain to that full stature intended for them in Your eternal kingdom. For the sake of Your dear Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen. Welcome to Saint Tammany's fall semester. I do believe this is the best looking group we've ever had here. St. Tammany, as they say is on a roll. Enrollment has nearly doubled in the last three years. And as a result, we've had to make a few slight adjustments. Academically, St. Tammany ranks right up there in the top 5% of all private schools. And in no uncertain terms, academics will be even more challenging yet more rewarding than ever before. (girls giggling) The fifth chapter of Romans tells us that tribulation brings about perseverance, perseverance proven character, proven character hope. Now, because of the rigors of my schedule I will no longer be coaching the basketball team. - Ah. (audience members clapping) - Now, now, we were two and 10 last year, it wasn't that bad. So I'd like to introduce to you the new coach, coach Lootie Pfandder has joined our staff. (all applauding) Expecting big things from you, so I expect you all to come out to the games. Now, there will be an orientation for the freshmen this afternoon. (inspirational music) (horn honking) (inspirational music continues) (ball hitting net) ♪ Yada da-da ♪ ♪ Lada da-da-da da-da-da ♪ ♪ Ya pum-pum-pum, ya ♪ Mornin' Missy. - Mornin', you must be Sam. - You'd be the new coach. - Yes. (Lootie laughs) Hey, where's the locker room? - We got this one and there's one just on the other side. - Great. (disheartening music) (doors clanging) (metal clanging) (balls thudding) (Lootie laughing) (Lootie sighs) St. Tammany on a roll, huh? Sure didn't waste any of it on the basketball facilities, did we? - No, we didn't. We blew our sports budget on smallpox inoculations for 3,000 yolly tribesmen. Coach Pfandder, we're just a small Episcopal girls' school here. We do things a little differently. (disheartening music) (Lootie sighs) (bright inspirational music) - Hi, Laura. - Nice to see you again. - Welcome home. - Thanks. - Hi, Bridget. (bright music) - Fine, fine, fine. So fine. - Come on. Hey, everybody. - Man. - This is Shalonda, our new girl. Shalonda, meet the girls. This is Kimberly, Donna, Bridget. (bright music) - Show you how to, sit. - A new mate? - Ah-huh. - You six foot? - Six, one. - Yeah, right? What position you play? - Post. - You any good? - Pretty good. - Pretty good? See this is Bridget over here, we call her the bridge. She blew out her knee last season. She was the best Post player we ever had. Are you good or are you great? - I'm good. - Did you get a scholarship? Or did you just have rich parents? - I got a scholarship. - Oh yeah? What was your point average last season? - About 16. - 16, and you got a scholarship? - This is a little tougher than junior high. (ball thudding) - Hey guys, take it easy. - Shut up, wimp. (bright music) - Some iced tea. - I'm famished. - Father Thomas, could you bring me some more tea? - Sure, wait there. Stop, stop, stop. Here you go, you're welcome. - Thanks. - Father Thomas, you'd better sit down and get something to eat. - Yeah, come on, sit down, Father, I'll go get you something to eat. - No, you just go ahead and pour your tea. Just don't worry about it. I'm good, I'll eat as soon as everyone is served. - Please. - Don't even look like you wanna be here. What's your name again? - Dunn, Kimberly Dunn. - Oh, right, Kimberly Dunn. Father Mulberry tells me you're our star player. You sure don't shine like a star to me. Aren't you having any fun, Kimberly? (Lootie sighs) All right. Front and center, let's go. - Move over, wimp. (Lootie sighs) - All right, Ms. Dunn, close your eyes. I said close them. Now when you were a little girl, I bet you could run and jump faster than any of the other kids, boys and girls. And you were probably laughing and playing, playing. because it was just a game. Yeah, you were a tomboy, all right but inside you wanted to be a tiny, petite, dainty, little ballerina, didn't you? Daddy's little princess. Do you remember what it was like to really want something? Give her the ball. Now close your eyes, Kimberly and see the basket through the eyes of that little girl and take that shot. (dramatic music) (ball thudding) Thank you very much, Ms. Dunn. Back in line. - Good job. - Goofy. - All right, who's next? - Can I try? - Not yet. Shalonda, come here. Yeah, here, let me see, let me see. Oh, nothing, nothing. Can I tell you secret? I really wanted to be a ballerina. - Me too. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Great. Close your eyes. Give me the ball. You remember dancing around your living room, really feeling that music? Okay, hear the music, Shalonda. Whenever you're ready. (gentle music box music) (ball thuds) (Lootie applauds) Congratulations, that was beautiful. - But I missed it. - Yeah, you missed it by a mile but you were focused and you were committed from inside. That's what I'm talking about, girls. You have got to play big. Look, you're gonna make shots and you're gonna miss shots. It's gonna happen anyway. But if you play with God in your heart, a smile on your face, that, that inner strength. That's what makes winners. All right, I want you all to try this now. One at a time. Get back in line. (suspenseful music) Woo! Ah, there we go! (Lootie applauding) All right. Close your eyes. (ball thudding) It's okay. Attagirl, attagirl. Woo, ah, there we go. (Lootie applauding) (knocking on window) Hey, you wanna see me? - Have a seat. (Father Thomas sighs) (Father Thomas sighs) I hope you haven't already unpacked. - What? - You were their coach, you know how bad they are. What was your record last year, oh and 12? - Two and 10. - Look, you hired me to coach the way I saw fit, was I wrong? - I didn't know you were going to be so creative. - You're upset with me for being a little too unconventional. - That would be a fair statement. Look, coach Pfandder, we're just a small Episcopal girls' school here. - And you do things a little differently. - Right? - What do you want me to do? Use your playbook? - Excellent idea. Just until you get your feet wet and see how we operate here. - Zones. - Why yes. I'm a big believer of play in the zone, it's simple. It works sort of like Christianity, wouldn't you say? On your resume, it did say you were a Christian, didn't it? - Yes. But we already use the same playbook for that. (melancholic music) (Lootie sighs) (Lootie sighs) (melancholic music) Lord, are you sure this is where I belong? I mean, what's with the zone business? I can't work under these conditions. I felt like I was being led here. So, if this is where You want me, this is where I'll stay. just stick it out together? (Lootie chuckles) (upbeat music) ♪ This is what ♪ ♪ This is what you need ♪ - Victoria. - Ah-huh? - You have to get them Rattigan shoes out of my locker. They're Pfandder' up everything. - My shoes aren't stinky. - Your shoes stink, your feet stink, your breath stinks. - Oh, let's not get started, who's the basketball player here? - Yeah, but my feet don't stink. You're stinkin' up the whole locker room. - Okay. (Victoria chuckles) (phone ringing) - Kimberly. - I told you I recognized her. - Recognize who? - Coach Pfandder. (phone ringing) You know, Lootie? - Yeah, Lootie. How'd she get that name? (Kimberly laughs) - Kimberly, she was in All American. - What kind of a name is Lootie? - She was in All American. - Yeah, right, In All American? - Oh, you don't believe? - No, let me see that. - See for yourself. - You're such a liar. (upbeat music) I don't believe it. - See, I told you. - Stace, look at that. - Let's see. Man, she must've been something. - What? - Let me see that. - Coach was in all American. - Are you serious? - I don't understand. - Let me have that. - I mean, why would she come to St. Tammany? - I don't know. - Well, maybe it was her best offer. - Guys, maybe she just wanted to coach us. - Yeah, right. - Yeah, right. (Kimberly laughs) I don't understand why she wouldn't tell us this. It's gotta be something else. - [Kimberly And Victoria] Jack, will there be something else? (girls giggling) - Oh yeah. Stop it. (girls giggling) I'm gonna find out, why'd she hide that from us? - I don't know, 'cause she don't like you. - Oh, she don't like you either, four eyes. (girls giggling) - Okay. - Stop! (all laughing) Watch the hat, watch the hat. (bright trumpet music) - [Announcer] And if you're just now joining us, we've got St. Tammany Episcopal in the season opening against the Lady Tigers. For St. Tammany, it looks like it's going to be a long night. And a very warm welcome for first year coach, Lootie Pfandder who is a second team on American NSE. Kimberly Dunn, we had the St. Tammany team in scoring last season, was Dunn all the light with 14 points and seven rebounds. (upbeat music) Freshman, Shalonda Win, playing the post tonight, has eight points. We're not disappointed in Coach Pfandder. (crowd cheering) - What are you doing in there, Shalonda? You can't go skipping, throwing in for a rebound, are you listening to me? - Coach, come on. - Come on, watch it! (suspenseful music) (whistle blowing) Let's go, girls, come in here. - Great going, Kimberly. - Listen up, girls. - Thanks, Sam. - Can't we do something else? We're getting hammered out there. - No. - Coach, send me in. - Not now, Julia. - Listen now, girls. - Can we do something else? Let's at least go man to man. - We can't. We're just gonna execute the zone better, okay? - Ah. - Hey, listen up. Anticipate the move, get to the outside, okay? Let's focus, girls, hands. Ready? - [Altogether] Team! - Come on. (all applauding) (birds chipping) (bus engine roaring) - Why'd you come out here? - Well, St. Tammany is my calling. Look, I know that being this first-year coach, people don't expect me to win. I don't care. - You don't care? - No. - You don't. - No, I don't. - Coach, I gotta tell you, my folks, they live less than 30 minutes away and I can't even remember the last time I was home. See, my good Christian step mother decided that she was just too young and attractive to have a young girl running around the house. She was afraid all the neighbors might think I was her daughter. So when I got stuck here, the only thing that's kept me going is playing basketball. I ain't come here to get saved. - What makes you think the two can't go hand in hand? (upbeat music) (water splashing) (ball bouncing) - Hi. (ball bouncing) (ball bouncing) Actually, I thought they looked pretty good for the first term game. - If you think that looks good, I'd hate to see what you think looks bad. (ball thudding) Honestly, Father Mulberry- - Call me Thomas. - Thomas. When are you going to turn me loose on these girls and teach 'em some basketball? (ball bouncing) - Basketball? - Yeah. (ball bouncing) - Basketball or something else? Understand you took them to an amusement park. (ball thudding) - So? Look, I figured they needed a little outside stimulation. No offense, but St. Tammany is a little like the bland leading the bland. If these girls learn nothing else from me, at least let them learn how to have some fun. (ball bouncing) - I don't need a 23 year old hot shot blowing in here making a lot of changes. (ball bounces) - That's right, I forgot. St. Tammany is a small Episcopal girls' school and you do things a little differently. (ball bouncing) Why don't you do things really different, Thomas, and win a basketball game. (ball bouncing) - Coach Pfandder- - Lootie. - Lootie. I think we should reconsider our working relationship. - Definitely. I'm not so sure on what you had in mind. - I'm not sure either. I mean, I wouldn't wanna put you out on the street or anything. I mean, what would you do? - Hey, don't worry about me. I got a job in broadcasting standing by in case this didn't work out. (ball bounces) - You do? - Yeah, I do. - Well, how do you think it's working out so far? - I don't know. - Well, do you think you're gonna take this other job? - I don't know. (ball bounces) - I see you're just sorta keeping your options open, is that it? - Got that right. (ball bouncing) (adventurous music) (adventurous music) - [Announcer] St. Tammany Episcopal is running on the top rows last week in the season opener against the Lady Tigers. New head coach Lootie Pfandder's looking for her first win tonight against a tough team who won last week against Loyal.

But we can beat them. I know we can. And don't forget girls, it's just a goofy game. All right, girls, bow your head. Lord, we most reverently pray for Your continued presence. And we thank You for allowing us to be healthy, strong athletes. And we pray that we will play for Your glory alone, amen. - Amen. - All right, ready? - Team! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (vehicle whooshing) (engine whirring) (gentle music) (bell tolling) (gentle music) - I didn't get to sleep on the road. - You didn't? - No. (both laughing) But you were out. - I was out. How embarrassing. - It was cute. - Why couldn't you sleep? - I've had a lot on my mind. (dog barking) - Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Look, you and I- - I don't. - What? - No. - No, go ahead. - No, please. - I just wanted to let you know that, I hope you'll stay. - I don't wanna go. - You don't? - No. - Great. - [Lootie] Yeah, great. - Great. Well, and I wanted you to know also that as your employer, I think we should maintain that. Look. I know we don't have a lot in common, but- - I like you too. Even though you're a little stuffy. (Lootie chuckles) - Stuffy? - Little, a little stuffy. We'll work on it. (both chuckling) Look, you gotta let me coach the way I wanna coach. - I know. - You gotta. - I promise. - [Lootie] Okay, okay. - I can still come to the games though, right? - Yeah, but you gotta, all right. - Look, I mean, we must maintain. - Yeah, yeah, right. (Lootie chuckles) Yeah. - [Altogether] One, two, five, one, two, six, one, two. - Just touch the ball, just touch it. Light pass, light passes. (exciting music) Very good, girls, focus. - [Altogether] One, one, two, five, one, two, six, one, two, seven, one, two, eight. Pick up, pick up. All right, spot on, pulse. Great job. (whistle blowing) (exciting music) - [Altogether] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - That's okay, stay with it, stay focused. - [Altogether] Five, six, seven, eight. - Watch what you're doing, light pass, very good, let's go, let's go, let's go. (exciting music) - [Altogether] Five, six. One, two. One, two. Five, six, seven. One, two. - Park it. (music drowns out Victoria) (upbeat music) - Focus. - Focus. - Focus. - Focus. - Focus. - Keep your eye on the ball at all times. - Keep your eye on the ball at all times. - Keep your eye on the ball at all times. - Keep your eye on the ball pretty annoying. You're a lousy, Father Thomas. - You know I bet you are. I don't see you as a star. - Oh, that was low. That was so low. You sick little girl. - Can you believe that? (gentle piano music) - Oh, yes, please. - [Waiter] Would you like some more tea? - No, thanks. (gentle piano music continues) What? - What? - What do you keep looking around for? - Oh, oh, no, it's nothing. (Lootie chuckles) - [Thomas] Okay. - Aren't you afraid that we're gonna be seen here? - Should I be? - I dunno, should you be? - Lootie, I'm an Episcopal priest. It's okay if we go out and date. We're not celibate. (Lootie chokes) You all right? - Hmm-mm. - You ever think about getting hitched? - I was engaged once. - Really? - Hmm-mm. It didn't work out. What about you? - My wife was killed in an accident 12 years ago, December. - I'm so sorry. (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] St. Tammany who's always too so far this season is hoping to turn things around tonight against the Lady Rebels. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) St. Tammany brings the ball up, beautiful no-look pass to Stacy D who pulls up for a jump and nails it. - And you guys, you're doing a great job with man-to-man. And Shalonda, you've gotta stay with your girl, I mean she's killing us on the inside. - I know. - And the rest of you, you need a better upside defense to help Shalonda. - Come on, do it. - Okay? - Sort it out. You're doing great. (Lootie sighs) - All right, just stay focused, girls. Be patient, let's take this one home. (upbeat music) (crowd cheers) (siren wailing) Kimberly, Donna, hustle. Get in here. Girls, We've gotta do a better job protecting this basketball. Amy, set a better pick for Kimberly and then roll to the ball. (girls clapping) - Okay, girls, listen up. All right, keep up with them. - Donna, find your man and then get it to her. We're doing fine, girls, just relax and focus. Remember what we've learned in practice? - Put the pressure defensively just keep doing what you're doing. Now, we have to set up on the offense, penetrate, Carrie. (siren wailing) - All right, come on, team. Ready? - [Altogether] Team!

That's the least of your problems. Police give you a ticket? - Yes, sir. - May I see it please? - Yes, sir.

(melancholic music) (footsteps pattering) - Sam, where's Kimberly? - She's in there. (door squeaking) (metal clanging) - Heading out? - Yup. (Lootie sighs) - Talked to the hospital today. Julia is in stable condition and the doctor says she's got an excellent chance of full recovery. - If she wakes up. - She'll wake up. - How do you know, did you pray about it? - You bet I did. You know, if Julia was here to give us her opinion you know she'd want you to stay. She really looks up to you. Don't give up so easily. Do it for Julia. You wouldn't want her to give up, would you? - Of course not. But she ain't got anything to say about it. You've heard Father Mulberry, I'm off the team. - Look, she might not have anything to say about it but I do. - That's right. I forgot you have Father Mulberry's undivided attention, don't you? It's all right, everybody knows about it. - Knows what, Kimberly? Father Mulberry and I are friends, period. (Lootie sighs) Look, if he says you can stay will you stay? - Look, I don't fit in here, you know that and I know that and I've already made up my mind, okay? I've caused everybody enough trouble. - Have I ever told you how much you remind me of me when I was your age? I wasn't a scrawny as you, but, I was the best player on the team too. And it would just burn me up when people would talk about teamwork. You gotta work as a team, but when it came down to it and we were in a jam, who did they look to? You know, everyone thought that I had it all together and everything going for me, but inside, I was so uncertain and insecure. - Until you found God? - Yeah. I didn't have to look very far. Search your heart, Kimberly. (gentle music) - I've been searching. (gentle music) Julia and your stupid shoes. (gentle music) (phone ringing) - You what? - You heard me. If she goes, I go. - You're bluffing. - Am I? (phone ringing) (Thomas sighs) - You sure are. Coach, Pfandder, I don't wanna let you go. And I'm not just thinking about the team. (gentle music) (machine beeping) - Julia, can you hear me? (machine beeping) You're the only girl I know who could score cute guy like Barney while you're laid up and looking goofy in a hospital bed. (machine beeping) It's just not fair, you asked me to drive and I wouldn't let you drive. Why'd you have to be such a wimp, huh? Why'd you have to be such a wimp? Everybody loves you, everybody loves you. Everybody loves you so much. So why, it should be me here, it shouldn't be you. It's not fair. - [Announcer] Dr. David, telephone please, Dr. David, telephone please. - God, I just wish that we could help, I wish you would would smile for me. I wish you could. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry, I wish you knew how sorry I was. (machine beeping) - You're Kimberly Dunn? - Yeah. - I'm sorry, Kimberly. This is Mr. Tumminello, he's Julia's grandfather. - You were driving the car? - [Kimberly] Yeah. - [Barney] I'll be out in the hall, okay? - Look, I know, all I can say is I'm sorry. - It was an accident, right? Well, wasn't it? Then that's fine. Are you all right? Me? - Hmm-mm. - I'm just fine. I'm not the one laying there unconscious. I just wish you could read the letters Julia's been writing me. I've often prayed that Julia would find happiness and she has, and as it usually is, happiness is spiritual. Julia's gonna be fine. But how about yourself, Kimberly? How are You going to be? (gentle music) - Girls, we need to just keep playing like we're at practice. Just 'cause your mom and dad are out there taking pictures of you, I don't want you all showing off. We need to make the basket. Keep movin' that ball. Take the shot when you know you have it. We need more points than the other team to win. Enough! (Lootie sighs) - [Stacy] Coach, where's Kimberly. - Yeah, where is she? - Kimberly has been through a lot since the accident. And I think that maybe she's gonna take some time off from basketball right now. Can't say that I blame her. We're gonna miss her, there's no doubt about that, but, we can still win this game. That means that we have to play tougher and harder and truly stay focused. We have to play like a team more than ever and let our thoughts and our prayers be with Julia tonight. I wanna dedicate this game to her. Let's take a moment of silence. (crowd faintly cheering) - This one's for Julia - Amen. - Amen. - Welcome to tonight's presentation of the RGV Times Classic Tournament finals. Tonight, they're defending for a Texas State champion and last year's tournament winner, East Texas High, brings an unbeatable record into a contest with a surprising, local favorite. A Class 3A, St. Tammany Episcopal girls' school, a team who is so new to competitive basketball, they haven't even had time to find a mascot. (crowd cheering) - Shoot! (crowd cheering) - Why didn't you call me? I didn't know you were gonna be here. - Well, I wouldn't miss this for the world, you know that I wouldn't. - Ah, it's good to see you. - Look, can we do an interview? - Of course, yes. - Here we go. All right. On the air. - Yeah. - I am standing here with the St. Tammany coach, Lootie Pfandder, coach, surprise, surprise. - Yeah, no kidding. - Tonight, she gave the East Texas team the shock of their life. Did you expect to win? - Hey, look, we always play to win, these girls have been playing well all week and Kimberly Dunn, did you see that three pointer? - Amazing three pointer. - They have got the spirit now. - And you showed it tonight. - Yeah. - Well, congratulations. - Thank you, thank you. - Thank you, thank you, cut. - How was that? - Oh, it was good, it was good.

(crowd cheering) (melancholic music) (Thomas exhales) (melancholic music) - Hi. - Hi. Good game. - Thanks. - Here, let me get that.

Now was supposed to go out and I was supposed to win a game for you and I did. - She did. - See? The deal was you were supposed to wake up. You're supposed to wake up, Julia. You're supposed to wake up. She was always such a wimp. (suspenseful music) - Who you calling a wimp? - Julia? - Julia? - Hey, you. - What about me, you little wimp? - You wimp. (victorious music) - I'm gonna go find your grandpa. (suspenseful music) - Okay. Hello, everyone, I'm Carl Hastings and I'll be play-by-play announcer for tonight's contest which has a real David versus Goliath flavor. And with home court advantage, the Southwood Lady Cowboys bring the ball down court. Lady Cowboys are 10 and four this season with Trish Dixon number 32, the Lady Cowboys point guard working the ball down under and scores with a short triple, pulling the southern team St. Tammany brings the ball up, works it around at the top of the queue over to Stacy Keen for a 12 footer, yes! St. Tammany back on top (indistinct) (crowd cheering) The Lady Cowboys bring it across the floor and get the ball down to their big center and she gets stopped by the freshman, Shalonda Win of St. Tammany. Andrews wield in a triple double in the last three games, it's finally living up to her potential according to Coach Lootie Pfandder. But it's number 23, post guard, Kimberly Dunn, who has clearly established herself as team leader. Rumors of Dunn quitting the team after an automobile accident that landed teammate Julia Tumminello in the hospital, apparently are unfounded. Much to the delight of St. Tammany fans. (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) And they started to play the Cowboys with the ball, brings it around and over to the forward for a spinning double. And Shalonda Win with another rebound. Coach Lootie Pfandder might be showing the wrong(indistinct) (crowd cheering) St. Tammany with the ball. Using their tricky stumble offense. Pass the ball down to number 12 for Stacy Keen Who shoots the jumper end. It's foul. (crowd cheering) Baskets wouldn't have counted as a foul was committed before the shot. - One shot (ball bouncing) (ball thudding) (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] Southwood with the ball and Southwood foul (crowd cheering) - St Tammany scores. (crowd cheering) St. Tammany Scores again. (crowd cheering) First trial, this St. Tammany team is amazing. (crowd cheering) - This one, no way. This one this one, perfect. - This one? - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. - Okay. Yeah. - It a paint , it got my name all over it. (Lootie laughs) Whoa! Oh, boy. (Lootie laughs) - Yeah. (Lootie laughs) What is with the hat? - What hat? - What hat? (Lootie chuckles) That one on your head. - Oh, this hat? - Yeah. Its cute. - You like it? - Yeah. Would wanna to be a cowboy when you grew up? - Yeah. (Lootie chuckles) I thought I was Hoot Gibson. - Hoot Gibson? - Hoot Gibson. You don't know who Hoot Gibson was? - Ah. - Gibson was this great big stuffy old cowboy. (Lootie chuckles) Well, it fits. - So Lootie. - Yeah. - You're serious about this TV reporter guy? (gentle music) (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] And here the ball gone, St.Tammany team is at it again. (crowd cheering) - They bring the ball on court, no the ball just trip, once again is Kimberly Dunn and it's another easy basketball for the team from St. Tammany. (crowd cheering and applauding ) And the ball goes to freshman sensational, Shalonda Win. It's in and that's 26 points. (crowd cheering) - Can I get an interview right now? - Sure. - Stand by everybody. Quiet on the set. Roll tape. Here we go. In five, four, three, two. - So here we are. - Here we are. - Tell me, coach, what was the point that you realized that your team was special? When did you first realize that you were headed for the state championship? - Well, one day we were practicing our free throws with our eyes closed. - With your eyes closed? - It's like I told you, practicing with faith. Believing in oneself and all the possibilities. We just take it one at a time. - Now your team doesn't have a mascot but you have been dubbed the St. Tammany Miracle. And I understand that you particularly don't care for that. - No, I don't. I mean it belittles our team's athletic talent and efforts. We will and do accept any and all help that might come our way. - Well, be that as it may, it's been nothing short of miraculous the way that you've taken this team from nowhere to where they are now. - We are on a roll, all right? But it's not a miracle. It's good old fashioned work and fundamentals and ideals and a strong foundation in belief in something higher and bigger than us. - Yeah, I know not everyone could take a team that was two and 12 and a district a year ago to this level. You have done the impossible. You don't have the height except for Shalonda Win and she's a freshman and you don't have the speed except possibly in your top scorer, Kimberly Dunn. And I couldn't characterize her as having blazing speed. - No, but Kimberly just knows how to beat you. I think it's called heart. - I think they call it the St. Tammany Miracle. And moving on, coach Pfandder, a personal question if you don't mind. - No, I don't mind. - The rumors are running rampant Lou and the suspense is killing me. It is no secret that several schools are interested in you as well as a one sports network that I can't mention but Lootie right here on television right now. Tell us what you're gonna do after the season's over. I understand that your contract might not be picked up by St. Tammany. - It's not about contracts. It's about believing in something. Whether Father Mulberry renews my contract. Well, I'll pass that bridge when I burn it. - And cut. Beautiful.Beautiful. - Thank you. - Great. - Thanks. It's all right. - Good. (gentle music) - Wow! - That's hot. - That is hot. (gentle music) - [Lootie] Thank you. - Thank you. (gentle music) - Are you sure? Whoa! Whoa! So this religious thing, it sort of made you a miracle worker, is that it? - No, Carl, once again, you're missing the point. - Am I? - Yeah. I don't like it. We're not a miracle team. We're a basketball team. And we've worked really hard to get this far. - Who happens to be leading the conference on a wing and a prayer. - Right. - Right. - Look, don't exploit us. It's not fair to my girls and it's not fair to my personal beliefs. - Why are you being so blatant about it? - Frankly, Carl, I don't think we're being blatant enough. Look, we're a small private Episcopal school and we do things a little differently. Do things a little differently. - You have people thinking that your team can just walk on a water. It is this religious thing. And that is why I'm... If you remember correctly that we didn't get married. You said you that you couldn't fully love someone who didn't share your faith. I never claimed to share your faith but neither did I criticize or interfere with your beliefs. - You don't think it's interfering by exploiting this miracle angle. I mean what am I supposed to tell my girls when you tell them that all their hard work is some sort of hocus-pocus. - Tell him I love you. Tell him I never stopped loving you. (gentle music) (air whooshing) - Okay. In five, four, three, two. Hello, everyone. I'm Carl Hastings. And I'll be your play by play announcer for tonight's contest. Not only has the Nichols high team been extremely successful over the past few years in this tournament but there's an added drama to the picture tonight. They are riding a 56 game winning streak which has spanned over two years and they can establish a new state record with their 57th straight win if they can gain a victory tonight. But standing in their way is the St. Tammany team, a small team, which no one expected to win 10 games a season, much less, make it to the state finals. They have ridden the shoulders of star, Kimberly Dunn and freshmen Shalonda Win who together have combined four 50% of the team's points and most of the rebounding. But everyone is wondering if new coach Lootie Pfandder and her St. Tammany team has run out of miracles. We'll see right after this brief message. - Ladies we're gonna win this game 'cause we're the better team. We're bigger, we're faster and we've been there a lot. You've played better teams than this in junior high. - Did you see 'em guys are huge. - Hey guys, we can do it. - But did you see "em? They're giants. - Did you see the size of number 13? - It's a monster. - Okay. They're big, but we can do it. - Hey girls, this team is gonna give us all we can handle and then some, have to find out if we have learned what it takes to be champions. - Now, you've seen the game film. They've got one hot shot then we're gonna take her out, right? - [Altogether] Right. - Don't forget where we've come from to get here. All the hard work, all the sacrifices. We have the power to make things go our way and we will make things go our way. - I don't want you to just beat 'em. I want you to humiliate 'em. I want you to kick that. (coach chuckles) I want you to crush them. - I hard off the back boards, even up the brakes and girls, remember, it's just basketball game. All right take a knee. Father. - Lord, accept our thanks and praise for all that you have done for us. - And these people stand for everything I'm against. I wanna teach these, do gooders a lesson. - Thank you for the splendor of the whole creation for the beauty of this world, for the wonder of life, and for the mystery of love. We also thank you for setting us at tasks which demand our best effort for leading us to accomplishments that satisfy and delight us. We also thank you for those disappointments and failures that lead us to acknowledge our dependence on you alone and above all Lord, we thank you for your Son, Jesus Christ. The truth of his Word and the example of his life in Jesus name, amen. - [Lootie] Amen. - Get the tip off. (whistle honking) - [Announcer] Nichols High sensational takes on St. Tammany on the state championship. (crowd cheering) Nichols are state champions and are so for undefeated. (crowd cheering) Kimberly Dunn brings the ball down over to Win and over to Kelly who scores and St. Tammany. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - Nichols stand up Olivia with a three point land and boy (Crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - Nichols with the ball at the top of the team and they pass it to the big number three (indistinct) Nichols up by four. (Crowd cheering) (upbeat music) St. Tammany with the ball (indistinct) and nails it. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) This S. Tammany team isn't going to go quietly I'll tell you that right now. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) Nichols with fast play and St. Tammany better do something if they wanna stay in this ball game. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (whistle blowing) And St. Tammany draw the foul. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) Nichols with the ball and (indistinct) but she's kept over the line. (crowd gasping) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - Well, maybe they're just too good, too big, too talented, too fast. Are you afraid to be champions? 'Cause that's what I see. I'm seeing fear out there and fear will defeat us before we even get started. (Lootie sighs) Girls. You've got the tools. Now's the time to use them. Don't leave anything out there. Give 'em everything you've got. Face that fear girls and let it go. (whistle hooking) (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] Olivia with the three point shot and St. Tammany, Shalonda win the rebound. (crowd cheering) (ball bouncing) (crowd cheering) (ball bouncing) St. Tammany with the ball. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) Here comes Nichols High , absolutely fearless. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) Kimberly Dunn with the ball, goes up and St Tammany is on fire. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - And sport fans, we're on the verge of an incredible offset tonight, incredible offset. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (whistle blow) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - Time out. - [Announcer] And the young coach calls for time out. That will be interesting to see what she gonna do now. - All right. Listen up. Listen. What? We're are going two three zone. - What? - Hop in there, don't let them penetrate, make them work the outside. Crush the balls. Help each others. Work together. (whistle blow) - What are we doing? - Two three zone! - Right. One, two, three. - Team! (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (coach giving instruction) (whistle blows) And one of St Tammany is down and coach Pfandder doesn't have anyone else to send. Wait a minute, What she doing? Who's that? Julia Tumminnello (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - Number 31 for 40. It's St. Tammany with the ball, the shot , the foul and the basket counts. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (coach shouting) - Come on gie me a break. Will you? It's the end of the game. - [Announcer] The Nichols coach is going crazy. And here we go. Nichols coach has been ejected. He didn't see that one coming. - Yes, if we make it but if we don't, we still have the ball, okay? The 14 seconds left, this one is all ours. - We can do it. - Kimberly. It's that bad? - I can. - No I'm serious about that, don't you shoot. Donna, I want you to do this. Number 32. - 32 let's go. - Good luck. (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] And Donna is the shoot to technical. And the 14 seconds left to St. Tammany team. Nichols on top by two. She takes the first shot. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (ball bouncing) Now for the second shot. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (victorious music) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - So you gotta admit that the zone defense still belongs in girl's high school basketball. - Yes it does but you have to know when to use it. - All right. - Right. - U admitted it. - Yes. (Lootie laughs) - And you certainly know when to you it. - Well, that's why you hired me. - That's right. - Are you sure you gonna be all right? - No, it's fine, really I promise. - Really. - All right. - You should go. - Well, you have always got St. Tammany. - Yeah. Yeah, I always got St. Tammany. (car hoots) (Lootie sighs) (birds chipping) - I gotta go. - Yeah.
