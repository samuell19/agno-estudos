Get yourself ready for school, boy. Dad. You miss that bus, I'm going to skin you and hang your bones out to dry. "Thank you for the lovely breakfast you prepared, mother."

Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm getting them through my fillings, just like last time. Cut the crap, Charlie. - Listen. - Jesus. They're the same ones that ruined my pitching career. Do you ever consider slowing down on the whiskey, Charlie? It ain't the whiskey. Sal. Sal, you remember, right? I was a prospect, huh? And I wasn't drinking then, was 1? Sure, Charlie, sure.

We are tracing the crites to a solar system where only one planet supports life... earth. Your ship database will contain adequate information on the culture of the planet.

Well, you look like you've done that a couple of times. A couple times. Come on. I want to keep an eye on you. Where are we going? = out to the field. Did you see that meteor? I saw something. Maybe it's a Russian spy probe on some sort of secret mission. I think you watch too much TV. Smells like oil burning. Smells like cow crap to me, dad. Shh. Holy shit! - Are you all right? - Yeah. What is it? Jay: Looks like one of the herd. - Brad: What happened to him? - I don't know. Without my gun, I don't want to find out. Let's go.

This is g xp 11 niner eight, come in, Alpha tango delta. Over. Sal: What is it, Jeff? Over. Hey, sal. Hi. Uh... How about we get some, uh, doughnuts and coffee after work, huh? Over.

Jay? - Transform. - Nothing likes me. Find something. Eating start. - Who are you calling? - Harv. I want to tell him what's going on out here. Maybe he's gotten other calls. - This phone is dead. - What? - Mom? - Okay. There's no reason for you to come down here. Just wait a minute. Probably just a circuit breaker's been tripped. What the...? Jay, any luck? = just a minute. What's wrong? - Dad! - Jay: Stay upstairs! Mom, we got to help him! - Bradley! - No, no, don't come down here! Jay, come on! What's down there?

I've been getting all sorts of calls about ufos in the area. Carla emmons swears that one nearly ran into her house and then went flying off. I think she's been dipping in the cooking Sherry again. I am starting to lose my Patience, Jeff. If you are sleeping on the job again, I am not going... Jay: I can't feel that. Hey, careful, boy. That's some kind of poison. That's better, babe. I'm beginning to get the feeling back. Steve: I'll get it. Oh! Aaah! April: Steve! Steve! Who's that? April! April? Brad! - April? - April: Brad! Brad, help! Hurry up! Do something, Brad!

Thank you, miss grubner. Tonight... I would like to read to you from the book of Genesis. Chapter 19... Which, as most of you know, is the story of sodom and gomorrah. Obviously, some of our citizens are... We're here for the crites. The county is going to pay for this, Jeff. Jeff? Jeff? Jeff Barnes? Jay... Jay, what are you doing? Maybe we ought to just stay put. They haven't gotten into the house yet. They will. We could board up the place. We could make it stronger. Helen, these things are vicious. They've cut out our phone, they've cut out our power. You understand what that means? It's just a matter of time until they get in here. Yeah, but we should just stay here... No, we can't wait. Wait up, Brad. - I can't go out. - Oh, yes, you can, darling. All right, Jay. Okay, let's go. We'll stay together. - I'm going to drive, Jay. - Okay, baby. Come on. Oh my god, Jay. Oh, mom. What the hell are those things? They're from outer space, like Charlie says. - Bradley. - Maybe they're some government experiment gone haywire. They used to be gophers, but got zapped by some radioactive... - Bradley! - What are we going to do now? - Steve's keys. - Oh, god. Wait! Jay: Stay together. Helen: Come on, come on. Go on! They're getting bigger! Brad: Come on, faster! Faster! - It's locked! - Come on! Go! Get in! Jay! Brad! Get him up to the door. Get your feet up, Jay! Mom, shoot! I can't! It must be empty! My pocket. My shirt pocket! - Helen: Get them. - Hurry! - Well? - The line's busy. I don't get it. Jay's never this late. Except when he has to pay for the beer. Yeah. Jake, they are coming. They are coming. They are not only coming, they are here. See, I was out on route 22... - And I looked up... - Have another drink, Charlie. I don't want another drink, Jake. I want harv. We're under attack. I'm going to leave it right here. Just don't bother me anymore. I saw the sign was shaking and everything. Woman: Isn't that Johnny Steele? Man: I don't know. Man: Whoa! Joe, let's go. Holy shit! Wonder what team he's on? Hey, Jake, are we gonna get a couple beers over here or what? You keep your shirt on, asshole. I got a problem here. You believe these guys? It ain't Halloween, is it? Man on TV: If anything does happen to me, you crooks won't live long. Man 2 on TV: What does he mean we won't live long? What can I get for you fellas? Reverend, what are you doing here? That's some outfit you got on. - We want the crites. - Oh, really? Who are they, some new team? The crites. Look, mister, I-l don't know what you're talking about. I think you all better be leaving before somebody gets hurt. You all have a serious attitude problem. Keep your shirt on, asshole. This had better be important. Sal: Harv, you better get down to the church. - All hell is breakin' loose. - What? Sal: The reverend says a couple of guys came into the place - they started shooting... - Whoa, slow down. Sal: Destroyed the organ, you know how beautiful... - Where's Jeff? - Sal: I don't know. I've been trying to get him for hours. Well, give me 10 minutes. He looks pretty sick, mom. I'm okay, sport. He's fine. He doesn't look fine to me. Why don't you go check the windows? - Brad: I already did. - Well, check them again! Brad: It's okay, mom. Oh, I'm so sorry. - April? - Yeah? You okay? The flue's open! Ohhh. Mom! The shotgun! Brad! Brad, look out! Aaah. Hey, hey! Hey, hey! I've been looking for you guys! I just want to talk to you. - At first he was Jeff. - Was it Jeff or wasn't it? - Well, he changed. - Changed? They were wearing really funny clothes. Like they was from Los Angeles. Okay, everybody, just calm down. Sal: Harv, all hell is breaking loose. Over. - Yeah, sal. Over. - There's been a disturbance at the bowlarama lanes. Over. Yeah, what kind of a disturbance? Over. Well... Evidently some guys shot up the bar. You get a description? Over. Well... It's kind of strange, harv, but Jake says it was reverend Miller and Charlie and some stranger. Hold it, hold it, hold it. I'm not reading you clear, sal. Repeat that. Over. Reverend Miller, Charlie McFadden and some stranger just shot up the bar at the bowlarama lanes! Over. Have you heard from Jeff? Over. I can't raise him, harv. Listen, I... I also got a report here about shots fired out route 22... Near the brown place. Over. Harv, do you read? Over. Sal, I want you to keep trying to raise Jeff. Now, I'm headed over to the bowling alley. Then I'm going to head out towards the browns' place. Over and out. = over and out. Get 'em, harv! Jay: Babe, I got to get to a phone, get some help out here. - 1 can do it. - Absolutely not. Dad, you can't even walk. I'm so tired. Damn. Son... Assuming I said okay, how would you do it? Hit the yard, grab my bike and head for the highway. Dad, somebody's got to go for help. All right. But boy, you ride like you never rode before. You get over to the emmons' house and get on the phone. - Get harv over here. - Dad, I'll be fine. - Don't worry. - You want to take this? Nah, you keep it. It'd just slow me down. Anyway, you might need it. Brad? See ya. Brad: Oh my gosh. They're growing! How ya feeling, hon? Like a brick hit me. Oh, baby. How long have I been...? Where's Brad? Brad has gone to get help. Oh, Jay, you shouldn't have let him go. Stop, stop! Wait! Go, just go. These things... These critters. Come on, go! Dad's all torn up and mom's got, like, a harpoon thing in her neck. And they're getting bigger. Let's go! Charlie? Where's Jeff? Hey, you're Johnny Steele. - Where? - Huh? Where are they? At my house. Come on, hit it. Where? Charlie, you know where my house is. Who are you guys? We want the crites. - The crites? - Critters, crites. You're not from around here, are you? Okay, okay. You help me, I help you. Stop it! God damn it, stop it! I got one. Get out of my house! Damn it! Give me some more rounds. - That's it. - Oh, Jay. Holy... Mom? Dad? Are you all right? - Are you all right? - Brad: Yeah.

I-I swallowed my chewing tobacco. Chewie? Here, Chewie. Brad: Chewie... Come here. Chewie. Where've you been? I've been looking all over for you. Come on. We're going for a ride. April: Brad, get down here! Brad! Help! Thanks. Oh, no. Helen: April! No, Helen, no! - No! - Where's April? It just grabbed her. I couldn't do...
