Mama, I promised Mrs. Tucci I'd bring eggnog to the party. What, did you forget? HANNAH: I didn't forget. Go on, I'll catch up. I better go with her, okay? Go! I can buy eggnog by myself. Okay, okay. She'll catch up, she'll catch up. You know, the smallest thing, Murray, she can't do. The smallest thing. Pretend you're with me. I'm not with you. Let go of me. I said let go of me! Shit. MAN: Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Wait just a minute there. You know, I wanna congratulate you, sir. Isn't he great, honey? Do you know, he followed me all the way out here 'cause I mentioned that I was gonna ask you if this was the year that you wanted. But I can clearly see in the light of day that this is not the vintage we discussed at all, is it? I'll see you at home, dear. Mr. Steinberg, I swear, I... Hannah, you know that boy from school? I've seen him around. I'm sorry. (SIGHING) Are you going to the Tucci party, Mr. Steinberg? Sure, I'm going to the Tucci party. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (ITALIAN MUSIC PLAYING) Sophia? Oh, Sophia! Hello. Hi. Yeah, I'm telling you... Have you seen Mickey? Yeah, check with Diamond. Okay. Hi. Hey, Hannah. How do I look? Nice. Good. Yeah. But, but I... Don't think you wanna go in there. (CHUCKLING) See you later, okay? Hi. I think we need to talk. Did you meet Teresa Lombardo? Oh, no. Yeah, she's Vinnie's cousin. She just moved back from Cleveland. Oh, yeah? Hello. She's gonna be teaching at the high school for the next semester. Oh, well, at least we got one more semester. You know, that school's been threatening to fall down for years. But 81 years and it's still there, huh? (PIANO PLAYING DISTANTLY) Oh, and listen. You hear that? They're rehearsing. They must be getting ready for Sing. You know that Sing? Rosie, Teresa was born in Brooklyn. You were born in Brooklyn? Bay Ridge. Bay Ridge? No kidding, huh? And you still got your natural hair color. Hmm, nice. Grandpa, are you having a good time? Wonderful. Good. Talk to you later. Come back, don't forget. Hannah. Whatever we had was beautiful, but I'm finding I'm a man with a lot of interests. I got a great thirst for life here, a thirst you don't seem to share, I might add. Hey, I just can't be held down at this time. (DOOR OPENING) Well, there you are, you two. Will you get in here? The kids are gonna sing. WOMAN: Come on into the living room, everyone. Come on. Later, all right? Mickey, bring her in here. It's the school song. You know, it's traditional.

(SCREAMING) Bitch! CAB DRIVER: Get out of there! I've got a gun! Bitch! (SIRENS WAILING) CAB DRIVER: Are you okay? Yeah. Boy! Are you lucky. I didn't punch the meter yet. (LAUGHING) I wasn't scared, I wasn't angry, I was surprised. And Soph, I had no idea that this neighborhood got so bad! Ma. Teresa. I'm going into the city for my tap class. Good. Talent is such a burden. (LAUGHING) She lives to dance. Hey, I took dance class all my life right over... What happened to Pinelli's dance studio? Gone! Here, look at this. Calucci's, gone. Giovanni's, burned down. Lembeck's Deli, they bought out and it failed. It's like every two weeks the bulldozer comes through. Another city block is gone. They're even talking about closing the school. All right, so how come nobody tries to turn it around? The crime, Teresa, the drugs. People move out, don't look back, except you. You came back. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) You look great! Whoa, whoa, whoa what are we doing here, huh? It's a screwdriver. What are you, a mechanic? What's wrong with a screwdriver, man? Get out of my face. Don't touch me, man. Thank you very much. That's my tool. Come on. BOY: Hey, Freddie! Bring back memories, Miss Lombardo? What? Oh, my God. Yes. What's Brooklyn without Sing? (LAUGHING) Tell me about it. You know, we haven't talked about this yet, but we are really under-staffed again this semester. So I was just... Oh, no. Excuse me, Teresa. What you got there, Hector? Oh, a nice little expensive Rolex. Where'd you get this one, Mr. Simeti? My brother gave it to me for Christmas. You got a problem with that? MR. MAROWITZ: And where'd your brother get it? DOMINIC: He saved his box tops. Here, all you have to do now is learn how to tell time. Take a hike, would you? Hat off. Hi, Phil. Hi, baby. This one. He says he ate his homework, all of it, because Satan told him the ink on the paper would make him sexually potent. Can you believe that? Yeah, I believe it. Felicia DeVere, Teresa Lombardo. Hi. Teresa's gonna be with us this semester. As a matter of fact, she's gonna be our new senior Sing advisor. I'm honored. Oh, you'll get over it, honey. No, you don't understand. I'm glad to have the chance to work with these kids and try to make a difference. Oh, a missionary. Excuse me, will you? Sunshine, take my advice. Students here tend to catch their fingers on these. So be careful, okay? TERESA: All right, people, I need you to listen up here. As you know, Sing is the annual musical competition between the seniors and the underclassmen. The Sing leaders that you elect today are responsible for creating and running the entire show. Excuse me, can I get you to put both feet on the floor? I don't do tricks. STUDENTS: Ohhh! TERESA: This afternoon your last period will be canceled. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) You are all required to be at the elections for your Sing leaders. GIRL: Come on! Miss Lombardo? Yeah. I'm Mickey Glaser. Mickey, looking very good. That's what I'm afraid of. This year I got a problem. No, what's he doing? Come on, once you're both elected, it'll be business as usual. You see, my grandmother, she just started recently coughing and coughing... Yo! Can I leave now? I voted. Hey, hey. What'd you do? Hang nail. (LAUGHING) Look, can I get out of here? Simeti, right? Yeah. Yeah. Look, uh... I got plans, all right? No. No. Sit down, Simeti. I think you might find this very interesting. Oh, Jesus. And from the sophomore class, Zena Ward! Come on down! (APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) It's not fair. Zena's co-leader is a junior, Aristotle Thermopolis. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) (WHISTLING) (CHEERS) Get out of there. Get out of there! Save that tongue for licking stamps. Whoo! Hannah Gottschalk! (APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) And Hannah's co-leader, it was a close one and I'm sure you've all got your individual favorites. But I've counted and I've re-counted, and there's no doubt about it. Hannah's co-leader for this year's Sing victory is Dominic Simeti! (EXCLAIMING IN SURPRISE) (DOMINIC SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Mr. Simeti. I brought you over a tentative rehearsal schedule. What? Well, you left so quickly. Look, Miss... What's your name? Lombardo. Miss Lombardo. I don't want to be in show business. Who does? I mean, we don't do Sing because we want a career, we do it for the experience and for the fun of it. I got other ideas about fun. You know who you look like? WOMAN: No. Meryl Streep. I bet. I was very surprised, Mr. Simeti, to dig out your school files and discover that you've got a record of drug possession, petty larceny, assault. So I got it covered. And you're on a court order probation. Yeah. See, I've been out of Brooklyn a while, but I thought that while you're on probation there are certain things that you didn't wanna do. Like mugging a woman getting into a taxi cab on a cold Christmas night. Just to make up some kinda wild situation. I don't know what you're talking about, I never done nothing like that. You see, I wouldn't have thought so either. You don't strike me as being that stupid. But if we were to have that bandage removed, and if as I suspect there are teeth marks, my teeth marks, you could spend the next semester and a few more years bunked out in a cell on Rikers Island. You might even find yourself sharpening your toothbrush handle to use for self-defense in the yard, hoping and praying the guards don't turn their backs and leave you to the mercy of some horny, slobbering, 400-pound murderer who wants to call you sweetheart. So you see, Mr. Simeti, you have a choice. You can spend the next three to five sucking up slop from an aluminum tray in a filthy prison cafeteria, or you could show up and serve your class as senior Sing leader. Either way, your ass is mine. What? Mickey wasn't elected? And you were? No, I just mean that you can't organize this whole thing by yourself. Oh, honey, I'm only thinking of you. It's just so much work for you. And you don't seem very happy about it. Yes, I know. I notice everything. Oh. Honey, you should be having the best time of your life. Mama, I'm not seeing Mickey anymore. It's over. What? Hannah! Can we maybe get some water over here? How long have you been coming here? Get it yourself. What over? How could you walk away from him? He walked away from me. And you just let him go? (HORN HONKING) Look at that technique, what a pro. What are you doing besides terrorizing the neighborhood? You think you're ready for something a little more profitable? Hell, yes. All right, are you busy tonight? Ah, shit. No, I got this dumbass thing down at the school, I've been there every night for three weeks now. Don't say I never asked you. Hey, listen, Freddy. (GROANS) And they got me sitting through these stupid auditions. Here. Here, I got something for you. Whoa, Freddy! Hey, have a good week, all right? Yeah. Watches! Give your big brother a kiss. Hey, how's Mom and Papa doing? Yeah, they're still saying rosaries for you. Yeah, well, you tell them to keep on praying. All right. (HORN HONKING) (POP INTRO PLAYING) Costume department?

Yeah, that's 'cause you're good at it. Well, I'm not doing this alone. Yeah, maybe. But, uh, this ain't exactly a great way to end a date. I thought you said, "This ain't no date." Changed my mind.

Ain't you interested in doing the best Sing possible? ALL: Ooh! (HISSING) (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING AND CLAPPING) Not bad. But, you see, this dance ain't just any dance. See, these people are hurtin'. They're gonna say goodbye and never see each other again. But do they freak out? No. They say, "Hey. "One more time. "Let's think about the years we had together." And they celebrate. The spirit. And that's how the dance should be, Stanley. Am I right? Yeah. Brooklyn Central has been an institution in this neighborhood for over 80 years. But now, after putting off this decision, the Board of Education had decided that, uh, at the end of this school semester... (SIGHS) At the end of this school semester, Central will close its doors and cease to operate as an educational institution in the city of New York. (ALL GASPING) I just got here.

Freddy, I know the people who own this place. Yeah, the old Jewish broad, so? So... Come on, Freddy, you're not gonna knock over the joint. Freddy, come on! Freddy, come on, man. We can't do this. You got a problem, get your punk ass outta here. You're the one bitching and moaning all the time, now go on, get out! Look. You don't wanna go inside, it's fine. You wait by the car, you keep the motor running and you don't do shit. You understand me? (SIGHS) Yo! Dominic. (HORN HONKING) MAN: Basically, Mrs. Gottschalk, the policy that your late husband had for theft has lapsed. Now, your loss of $4,000 would have been covered if you'd... Don't tell me that. Please don't tell me what I should've done. I mean, let me tell you, I wasn't meant to live like this. One day I've got a healthy husband, and the next day he's just cold as marble. And Harry leaves me what? He leaves me two kids and a restaurant broken down in a dying neighborhood. It isn't easy. What am I gonna do now? Go ahead. Tell them. Look, I don't want to get anybody in trouble. Tell them. BOY 1: Sign our petition! BOY 2: Save our school. Show up at the Board of Ed. BOY 1: Come on, sign up. Hey, wait. Slow down, Dominic. Are we gonna see you at the Board of Ed? We need all the help we can get. Why bother? Wait a minute! They're not just closing down the school. They're gonna cancel Sing, and that show's practically yours. What happened to all the hard work you put into it? Go to the movies. I don't care. Hey! Wait a minute. I got you into this thing. You show up and you help me out and I'll forget our little deal, okay? Okay? You son of a bitch! Hey! Hey! How could you do that to me? What are you talking about? "Trust me", you said. How can anyone ever trust you? Hannah, what did I do to you? You want me to answer that? Go ahead. You're a liar and a thief! You don't know what you're saying. Yeah? Well, then how come you're trying to run? And what do you know? You ain't nothing but a piece of shit waitress. Dominic! (BREATHING HEAVILY) Dominic, (STUDENTS MURMURING) Hannah, what's going on here? Hannah? Look, Dominic. You pay your money, you take the chances. No, I mean, if somebody saw me there, Freddy. Just suppose somebody saw me there and I get caught? FREDDY: What do you want? I don't make no guarantees. Here all the time, lookin' at me. Wanting what I got. Well, I never see Papa getting hits like that. Papa's scrapin'. He always has. No, I tried it like Papa. Pretty soon I'm gonna get out. You ought to think about doing the same, 'cause otherwise you're gonna end up like everybody else around here. A nobody. That's not true, Freddy. Everybody here's got a name. Nobody! You know why? Huh? 'Cause you think big, but you don't got the guts to grab it. Not like me. You think you're so smart. I feel bad, Freddy. So? Feel better. South America's finest. Salute! (CHUCKLES) Hey! Hey! My little brother. I love him. Hannah! Look. I, I know you don't want to see me, and I know you don't want to hear from me, but there's something that I had to do. Now look here, that's my Rolex. It's worth a lot of money. I don't know how much, but I know it's worth a lot. And I got some cash here, it's almost, like, 200 bucks. It's all I got. What's this for, Dominic? I thought you were clean. Look, Hannah, just 'cause I wanna help out doesn't mean that I did nothing. All right, all right. Look. Just suppose, all right, just suppose that I know these guys who knew about your robbery, all right? Just suppose. And then I get to feeling bad about everything... It was $4,000, you asshole. Don't try and buy me off with some wrist watch. Hannah, Hannah! Hannah! This is a Rolex. I mean, look at this watch. That $4,000 broke my mother's back. Insurance ain't gonna pay it, so we're not gonna make it. We don't have it. I bet you know who does. (SIGHS) I swear to God, I'll pay you back. I swear to God, Hannah. I don't got it. Look, what if I pay you back a little at a time. I'll give you like 100 bucks a month. I hear your brother does all right for himself. You want to help so much, why don't you get the money from him? That kind of money? Freddy will kill me! What do you want from me? You want me to cry for you? Why don't you get away from our house? (DOOR SLAMS) MR. FRYE: I don't know how to make it any clearer to you people. Central is a depressed high school. In recent years, it's been characterized by a drop in attendance, falling test scores, violence, increased drug traffic... What do we got to do to get you to keep our school open? Hey, we ain't any Western High. Or that other school. Yeah, what about them? This is a decision that has come down from Albany, from the State Board, and there is no changing it. He's not gonna listen to us. I don't know why we bother. MAN 1: You got that right! MAN 2: Ain't that the truth! We all appreciate your feelings here. I grew up here too. I went to school with some of you. But in June this school is gonna be closed. These gentlemen will begin working at the school Monday, to oversee the orderly and final disassembly of the school plan. You will, please, give them your fullest cooperation. Thank you. WOMAN 1: No! Now wait a minute, all right? What about our Sing? What are you gonna do about Sing? All extra-curricular activities will be terminated. We don't have the budget. Now, wait just one minute. Every year, for 40 years, every high school class in Brooklyn has staged this show. And with every year passing it's become more... This show has become part of the community, Elliot. That's right. So you're not only gonna close our school, you're gonna... You're gonna take away Sing too? This is a community in crisis, Mr. Frye! And that is precisely why this is happening. Do you think I personally am doing this? You think we invent these statistics? What have statistics got to do with the school's show, for Christ's sakes? My Cecelia, my daughter. She made her own costumes! Yeah. We cannot afford... HANNAH: Mr. Frye, it wouldn't have to cost you a cent. It wouldn't have to cost anybody anything. Young lady, you are out of order. DOMINIC: Hey! Hey! Hey, let her talk! Mr. Scarpetti, you own a paint store, right? You could give us some paint, huh? I'll give them all the paint they need. (ALL CHEERING) I have lumber. Anybody needs lumber, they got it. Atta boy! (ALL CHEERING) Mr. Frye! Hey, Mr. Frye, look at this. Cecilia, show him your splits. (ALL CHEERING) That's my daughter. We want Sing! Yeah. Yeah! Sing! (SCATTERED CHANTING) Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Listen to me! Listen to me! No! No. Elliot Frye may be closing down this school, but as long as I'm principal, he's not gonna tell me how to run it. I've been working too long inside this system not to find a way to work outside it, Teresa. And no four-eyed son of a bitch from the Board of Education is gonna stop me from giving my kids one final Sing! HANNAH: All right, you guys. They're gonna close our school, we can't stop them. (ALL GROANING) They're telling us we're not worth anything, Mr. Marowitz has put his ass on the line for us to prove different. So, we've got to do everything we can away from the school so nobody at the Board of Ed finds out. I don't know where the underclassmen are hiding out to rehearse, but you gotta remember they got Mrs. DeVere. ALL: Ooh. And we all know Mrs. DeVere. She doesn't take defeat lightly. Let's get something straight! We're either gonna make history, or we're gonna be history. You think you're tired now? Well, you ain't seen tired yet. You think you got a winning show? Well, you better pick up the pace right now or we all might as well pack up our buns and go home! Now get back to work. (ALL CHATTERING) Take it from the top. Hit it! You got something you wanna add? (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) I didn't wanna have to do this. But it's like I always say. You've got to get them on their feet before you can kick them in the ass.

Those rehearsals keep going so late, you'll be showing up for work after I've locked up. Huh. Not that it matters anymore. Murray's accountant looked over my books today. And he told me that I ought to put this place on the market as soon... Do you know something about this? What do you know about this? Uh... (CHUCKLES) I've been such an idiot. You knew where this money was all the time, didn't you? And you sat there and you let some stupid punk kid destroy our lives? His name's Dominic. Oh. The money's back. That boy is scum. He's garbage. And you take his side against your own family! You're... Garbage. Is that what you think of me? God, are you so bitter and disappointed that that's how I look to you? Listen. If I was living your life... (GRUNTS) (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE) Yo! (MUSIC STOPS) A person could get mugged out here at this hour. Where you been? How come you don't come around anymore? I've been working with my brother. Family business. There's a whole family of people that would really like you back at Sing. I don't need those people. I got plenty of friends. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Who? (SCOFFS) Who? Nobody knew your name before you started Sing. You almost got through high school without anybody knowing who you are. Some trick. Now, look, I'm gonna tell you something. My brother Freddy is the only one who cares about me. More than just about anybody. Okay. Okay. I think I remember those moves. The Atlantis number. How's the rest of it go? There's no more. Sure there is. I don't know, there's no more. I was watching you. Hey, look. You want everybody singing and dancing all the time? That's your problem. And, uh, you don't have any problems? Right. And you got it so perfect. You got so much to look forward to. No old man, no kids, no job, no life. You're a real winner. Look, go home, lady. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) I never hurt you.

TERESA: Please. Please. God. Oh, Jesus. Go away. Go away! Get outta here. SOPHIA: The kids and the parents are all working late. About 3:00 in the morning, Carol Hershkowitz and me get up onstage and we do the finale from the 1962 show, and we remembered it. ♪ Oh, baby ♪ Wah, wah, wah, wah ♪ Baby ♪ (LAUGHS) We was peeing, we was laughing so hard. Oh, God. Oh! And somebody there reminds us it's the last one. (SIGHS) People tell me Hannah did a great job with the seniors. Is that so? Oh, she doesn't tell you? They're working very hard. Rosie, you have been an angel as always. Oh, Sophia. I gotta get this over to the school. Okay. Give me a kiss. I'll see you there tonight. Oh, I don't know. SOPHIA: Don't talk nonsense. I brought you your tickets. 7:30. (SIGHS) Sold out, huh? We're packed. Set a record. At least we're going out with a bang, huh? So here are your tickets. Maybe you wanna give those to someone who can use them. Did you get other seats? I just have a lot of things to do here and back at the house. I decided. (SINGING INDISTINCTLY) Okay, that's good. Now go to the chorus. No, I don't know my line. I'm telling you I don't know... Please tell me you know the line. I don't know what it is. Mrs. DeVere, I cannot remember my first line. Get you Sing program here. The official Sing program for only 50 cents. One half of a dime. Tell her who makes the best cake. Tell her. Come on. Listen to this. Come on. There's standing room in the back and in the balcony. The underclass show will begin in exactly two minutes. Jesus Christ, Phil, what the hell are you doing? Do you think I give orders just to hear myself talk? MR. MAROWITZ: Elliot, you don't want me to answer that. Mr. Marowitz? Mr. Marowitz, I don't wanna start a panic, but there seems to be a small fire in the basement. Down here! This is all I need. We'll have to empty the school. I will see to it you never work in this educational system again. Somebody please tell me, where's this fire? In here, in here. Elliot Frye. You were a pimply-faced schmuck in the 12th grade. You are still a schmuck. (MR. FRYE YELLING) And a royal pain in the ass! MR. FRYEOpen the door! The fire's out. Sophia, I love you. How you doing, kids? Hey. How you doing? Hey, how you doing, man? MAN: Mr. Marowitz? Hey, yeah. Hi, kids. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the 45th and final Brooklyn Central High School Sing. Looks like we made it after all.

I'm sorry I wasn't around to, you know, help you out a little more. Are you serious? Yeah. Come on, you cast the show. You choreographed all the dances, you pissed me off. (LAUGHS) But you're inspiring. Maybe. But, um... No. We all did it together... No. It was you. It was you. Start to finish. It was you. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) What?

Yeah, but who knows his lines? Who knows the dancing? Who knows the songs? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (CHUCKLES) No way! Let me out of here, goddamn it! (CHANTING IN DISTANCE) They aren't gonna know what hit them. This act is brilliant. Especially the pyramid. Break a leg, honey. I told you, I am not doing the pyramid. Too late, babe. I told the other kids. Oh, Jesus. Look, do not bother me with this shit now. Why? Because I have to go out there and save this show. Out, out, Grim Reaper. Be gone.

Now, I want to remember that we have a very long show, and I do not wanna lose one point for going over time. So keep up the spirit and the pace! (CHANTING) Seniors! Seniors! (ORCHESTRAL INTRO PLAYING) When this island of Atlantis explodes, we will surely die. My friends, we have no idea what other lands lie beyond the great waters. We must take our chances on the waves.

Somehow, I think this year it doesn't really matter. There's a lot of people who told us we couldn't do this show. And maybe we couldn't keep our school open, but they couldn't keep us from being here. And maybe we stay here in Brooklyn, or maybe we have to move far away. But at least we know, we'll always know, just how good it can be. 'Cause we've lived it. And I'll bet there's nothing like it, not anywhere.
