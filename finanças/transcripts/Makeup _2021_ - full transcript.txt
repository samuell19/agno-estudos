Congratulations old boy. Well, you can't put any price on masterpieces like that. They're worth the, well... My friend. Hello? Hello? Um... I think you left me in the wrong place. It's not number 31. No, I'm absolutely sure. I'm staring at the river. I know you're driving. I know you're busy. I'm not going to leave you five star review if you-- No, I left you two stars, because I just said you left me in the wrong place. I could have left you one star, I gave you two. Can I, can I rebook? I can't rebook. I'll try find my way. Okay. Bye-Bye. Right, right of course. Look we'll see what happens when the market opens tomorrow. Anyway, I'm at my front door. Talk to you later. Fuck, you've been waiting here long? -A little, little bit. -You should have texted me. Work was a fucking nightmare. I did actually. Your bathroom's there on the left. My room's up those stairs, and this is your room. Used to be my stepdaughter's room actually. Oh, that light switch doesn't work. You're gonna have to use the lamp. There we go. Welcome. You can paint the walls if you like. Well, I'm gonna leave you to it. Unpack and settle in. You'll let me know if you need anything. I'll be just up the stairs. One more thing. How is it you pronounce your name again? S--Sacha. Isn't that a girl's name? All right. Good night. Harry, how's the wife? Yep and I'll get the numbers now. Sir, please, I understand it. You have to remain calm, okay? No one could have predicted what happened last week, but I told you this week things would level out. Where the fuck are those numbers? FTSE is up two points, like I said it would do today. -Sorry? -I said where the fuck are those numbers? I put them on your desk earlier. They're not here now, are they? You know what? I actually do have a new stock option for your portfolio. Go. Now. Find them. Find them. Hello, sir. Um... My colleague is actually out at the moment. Will it be possible for me to send you an email? Okay, lovely talking to you too, Harry. You take care now. All right, good bye. Morning, bro. See my sales from last week? Yeah, I have actually. I've been hitting some pretty big figures, haven't I? And I've only been here a year. How are your numbers been looking recently? Surely you've seen. Oh, shit. Is that your sales report I'm sat on? Don't worry about that son. Anyway, I'm going on my break now, so look after the place while I'm gone, will you? You're doing great. Morning, Dan. Love your work so much take it to the bathroom with you? Good morning, Gracie. So, which hand seems to be giving you the issue? The right. Have you been exerting yourself recently? Sorry? Sports, you know, bats, balls, hoops, that sort of thing. Well, not usually, but this morning I did actually play a bit of squoosh. Squash? -Squoosh, yes. -Squash. The bat and-- The balls, the bat, and the balls. It's just the one ball. -The bat and the ball. -Cool -Would that table be alright? -Yes, fine. -Thank you. -Perfect. Can I get you anything to drink? Just water is fine. Thank you. Thank you. Can I... Sorry, I'm ready to order. Okay. -Can I get this one please? -Excellent choice. Thank you. One Char Kuey Teow. Yes. Yes, thank you. Enjoy. Sacha! This is my housemate I was telling you about and he's a little shy. Come meet the lovely Katie. Hey, Sacha. Hello. Are you hungry? I've made food enough for three. No, I've just eaten, thank you. No, okay. I've got some whiskey here. I've got some wine somewhere. Let me just check. Must have forgot down, no? -Not in the dishwasher. -He just ran upstairs. -Oh. -Yeah. -Guess not then. -No. -I'll have one then. -Yeah, it's more for us. Today, I visited the Flying Fish restaurant on Portland Street. At the door, I was greeted by the maître d'. He took my jacket and hung it up before taking me to my table. After being seated, I noticed that the glass on my table was dirty. Are you ready? Five. Ready? Five, six, seven, eight, and one, two, three, four, five. As well as the cutlery. It seems as though they focus more on the service, but not enough on the cleanliness of the tableware. Doors opening. Doors closing. - Morning, Dan. - Good morning, Gracie. Any packages arrive in my name this morning? I think I might have seen something. You ordering goodies to the office again? Yeah, something like that, yeah. Is that a new dress you got on there, Gracie? -It's lovely. -Well, thank you, Dan. You don't look so bad yourself. Are you saying I look handsome? Maybe. -There you go, darling. -Thank you. Gracie? Hmm? Do you think I look pretty? Sorry? It's just a joke, Gracie. Fuck me. -I-I-I-I... I'm really. -Shhh. Okay. Some wine? Apologies. Peter. I guess you're calling about that stock we spoke about the other day. Oh, Sacha. You're just in time. I've made soup. No, I'm not hungry. What? I can't hear you, come in here. I'm not hungry, thank you. Do you ever eat? Yes, I'm actually a food critic. A what? A food critic, I have a food blog. Oh, you're one of those. So what, does that mean you eat at fancy restaurants for a living then? I guess. Well, why don't you come and critique my famous soup? It's had great reviews. -I'm really not very-- -Ah, nonsense. Come on, take a seat. Okay. What you wanna drink, whiskey or wine? I'm not much of a drinker. Water it is then. So how you finding living here, Sacha? -Yes, it's fine. -All good, yes. And the room, is it to your liking? Mm-hmm, yes. Hope I'm not charging too much rent. Shouldn't have asked. Oh, wait a minute. Don't eat another bite. Forgot the garnish. Dan, what is this? It's peanut butter. Peanut butter? Yeah, enjoy. Bon appetite. It's actually bon appétit in French. What? Nothing. Give it a bit of a mix. It's good, ain't it? A bit too spicy though. The peanut butter, for me, it's a bit too salty... personally. Right. Well, don't force yourself to eat any more if you don't want to. Okay, thank you. I hope you enjoy your evening. Thanks. I appreciate it. Do you want me to put that away for you, for later? No, thank you. Sacha, you busy? Well, yes. I'm actually on the-- Hey, I just wanted to apologize for the way you saw me last night. Oh, it's absolutely fine the way that you... You know... Lucy used to love these sheets. This bed. This room. You know, my ex-wife, she never really knew how to react when she saw me like that either. I actually met her when I was studying drama back in Ireland. She had a young daughter at the time, not much money... and then she got this job offer here in London and she had to take it. And of course I followed. You know, I loved them both dearly. I built a pretty sweet life for us here... but I could never quite detach from that desire to perform. I've got this character that lives inside of me and she just wants to entertain. But my ex-wife never quite understood that. It's funny, I used to run around and steal my ex-wife's clothes, wear her makeup. She just used to ignore it. I thought she might even be used to it. Until one day I came home and they were both gone. And a few weeks later, the papers came through the post... and that was that. Do you want to know what the worst part about all this is? I haven't seen little Lucy since they left. Sorry. I didn't mean to make you sad. And I definitely didn't mean to cast a dark shadow on your evening. I actually just came to see if you wanted to maybe come to my show tonight. It's the first one I'm doing. I dress up and dance and stuff, so. I guess if you want to come, I mean, you're in your pajamas, but if you can get dressed. I mean, whatever. -Okay, thank you. -Or next time. It's--it's up to you. Just let me know. They say you should always start with something that shows the audience you are relatable. Are mannequins getting sexier or am I just getting creepier? Either way, I'm not allowed back at the Baby Gap... for nine months. Do you need some help with those lashes? Sure, thanks Tilt your head back. Hold still. Hold still. And the next one. As soon as you're on stage... those nerves will go away. There's always that one moment in the relationship where you start to leave the door open when you pee. She walks by all disgusted when she sees you violently shaking it around and just slapping it back in. Oh, fucking hell. You can't say shit like that. Do we have smelly pissy dicks? Yes. But that's why it's important to always place your cock back in the sock before you put it away. Am I right, guys? Looking lovely ladies. All right, on in two. Go home and think about it. So I'll leave you with this. If you're not supposed to piss in the sink, then why are they at cock height? Thanks very much everyone, stay dry. Give it up for Pete! All right, how's everyone enjoying the evening so far? I'm glad you enjoyed our Pete on stand up. Now who's ready for some cabaret? Yeah, bring on the ladies! Oh, I've got some ladies for you, all right. Presenting our final performance of the evening, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, put your hands together and make some noise for our Midnight Mistresses. Thought it was supposed to be girls? Is that Dan? -No. Is it? -It's Dan. Oh. This is brilliant. Oh, fuck, look, there he is. Ah, mate, this is gonna kill him. Walking a bit funny there, mate. You been taking it up the... Nah, some twat fouled me on the weekend when I was playing football, actually. Oh? Didn't know you played football. Didn't know you gave a fuck. -Twat -Prick. Very important meeting. There's one person coming about 20 minutes later, so just send them up when you can, okay? The leg all right, buddy? Yeah, some twat fouled me when I was playing football. Oh, no. It's all right though, my team still won. Ah, good, good. Listen, Dan, I'm taking all my top boys out for dinner tonight. You know that nice place on Fenchurch? -Yeah, the one from before? -That's the one, we're leaving at eight. -On a Thursday though? -Absolutely, pal. Big news doesn't always land on a weekend. -Okay, sure. I'll see you there. -Good man. Right, so can you just bring catering up 15 minutes later? -Thanks, love. -Okay. -Sir? -Oh yes, thank you. Thank you. Hey, buddy. All right, I want these boys, I want them treated well, okay? All I'm interested in is hookers and cocaine. -I know you are. -All right, well, if you're not putting 10 grand on the table, I'm walking home right now. I only want to hear hookers and cocaine. I know, but what is the plan? Where we going? Right, so hookers first. Boys, quiet down, quiet down. I've got some great fucking news. We've just started working with our largest client to date, a 50 million pound portfolio that we all get to play with and it's all due to my man here, the fastest rising lad. You deserve it, buddy. It's been good work. Now-- now listen, you thought last time was wild? Tonight, I'm raising the fucking stakes baby. Tonight is gonna be off the fucking scale. I want every one of you getting into it, and not remembering a fucking second of it. Let's get cracking. - Fuck yes. - Yes. Uh, we don't need any more food, thanks, but I will take another bottle-- two bottles. -Thank you. -No. Sorry, I just wanted to say hello to Dan, actually. Who's this weasel? You know my Dan? Oh, yeah. Guys, this is Sacha, he just moved in with me. Moved in? What? Like a partner? No, you fucking idiot. He rents a room. -All right, chill out. -Calm down, Dan. Okay, well, it was nice to meet you all. -Yeah, good one, pal. -See you later. Whoa, wait a minute. Introduce yourself, have a drink, sit down. -Sacha, you don't have to. -No, no he doesn't. No, no, no, look, it's fine. We'll grab you a chair, okay? Hey, darling, grab us a chair. Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be getting girls over. Come On, Jay. Jesus, Mate. Yep. Thank you. -Okay. -I don't drink. Oh, my God. So you don't drink, okay. So what do you do then, Sala... Sacha, Sacha. Sacha, right? Yeah. Sacha. So what do you do? Um... well, actually I'm a food critic. That's why I'm here today. But don't tell them obviously. No, we won't. Okay, well, I used to be a chef, and Dan's actually good at cooking as well. Wait, Dan's good looking? I think he said Dan gives good cocking All right, all right. That's enough. Whoa, we're just having some fun with our new friend. Anyway, back to the drinking, boys. - Absolutely. - Fucking boring. Just leave whenever you want, mate. It's all good. Jay, you can get lost as well. Fuck you all. Here we go. He makes me a lot of money, so he can't leave, but you certainly can. Come on, someone gimme a straw. Come on, let's go. Cheers. Come on, Dan. Have a drink, buddy. He still ain't got the fucking message, has he? No. You're fucking boring, so do one. I hope you enjoy your meal. Good on ya. See ya, champ. Thanks Jay. - Morning, Gracie - Morning. Oh, Dan, the boss has asked to see you in his office. But our meeting's not till four. Well, he said he wants to see you now. Okay. Going up. Doors closing. Yep, he's on his way. Yep, come in. You wanted to see me? Yeah, close the door please, Dan. How's the foot? Much better, thanks. Good. Take a seat. Listen, Dan... I had to come in pretty bloody early this morning and I feel like a ton of shit because something has been brought to my attention that I didn't expect. You have become somewhat of a distraction in the office. I'm not sure I follow. Do you feel comfortable coming to work every day in a suit? Yeah, I mean, it's part of the job, you know, I'm used to it. Hm... I don't think you're comfortable in a suit. I think you're more comfortable in something like what Jenny's wearing... something a bit tighter, but I cannot have you coming into the office wearing what she's wearing, can I? Look, I don't know what you've heard, but I'm not like that here. Okay? I come in, I do my job and I leave. I mean, last year alone I got you 50% of the biggest contracts you're working with to date. Listen, listen, listen, Dan, there's a video of you circulating the office. The boys saw you performing in some show the other night. Then Gracie brings me a folder from your desk thinking it's the sales report but all I find inside is a women's fashion magazine. Now I'll be honest, I thought you were just a normal dude, using some material to knock one out quickly in the gents. We're all guilty of it, I can tell you that much. But now I found I have a much bigger problem. Look, Rudy, whatever I do in my personal life has nothing to do with what I do-- Come on, pal. Be honest with yourself. I'm raising a pack of fucking sharks here. Not a cute little school of rainbow fish. What if my biggest client sees one of my top boys prancing around in fish nets... looking hotter than my receptionist? Do you think that would look right? Look... do you think... I can put my entire reputation on the line, because of this? Do you think I have that option? It's just the way it is, I'm afraid, Dan. Yeah? I knew you'd understand. I'll get Gracie to clear your desk for you. Good luck, Dan. Ah, mate, this is jokes. Oh, here she is. Hey, watch this. Oi, everything all right? Yeah, fine. What happened in there? Nothing. -Oh, shit. Did you get fired? -It's none of your concern. Wow, I guess if you're leaving, I'll happily take your spot as top broker. Take it. Do you finally feel pretty, Dan? 'Cause I thought you looked proper fit the other night. I like that part where you run off stage in your heels. Is that how you fucked your ankle? Fuck! Fucking fire me. You fucking fire me. You can't fire me. I fucking quit. Danielle. Danielle, Danielle. What are you talking about? Dani? Who are you talking to? Are you talking to me like that? Here you go, girl. You wanna fire me? Danielle? Are you okay? Um... I have a hand condition. How is this the first time I've seen it? Uh, I don't know. Um... I have regular medication for it, and that usually calms it down, but it can happen more frequently if I'm stressed... or uncomfortable. Well, I hope it's not me that makes you feel uncomfortable, Sacha. I'm not very good at explaining how I feel. But I actually feel uncomfortable because I feel like I could make you uncomfortable. You're too sweet. I didn't know you smoke. You never asked. Of course I wouldn't carry a thing like that around with me. I wish I bloody did to clear you lot off my back. My client doesn't mean that. You make many any enemies in the line of work? Fucked anyone you weren't supposed to? Ah! Buenos dias, Sacha. Seen this movie before? It's a classic. Get out in the field, and have some first-hand experience. Mmm. Come. I'll put it back. Take a seat. Did you sleep last night, Dan? Not much. And how is the ankle? Much better. I've been using more natural remedies. How's the hand? Um... okay. As you know I have my vitamins. Vitamins? And that works? Placebo. Hmm. Ever tried a more herbal course of medication for your hand? Sacha, gone to the dance studio. I'll be back in the evening, kiss. I recently visited the City Brasserie restaurant near Richmond Park. I'm not quite sure how to express the unpleasantries. Not unpleasantries. It's a bit harsh. I shouldn't say unpleasant. Maybe I could say it was undesire-- no, not undesirable. Let me think, hmm. Hello, Dan. Smells amazing. Should I be getting used to this. Well, maybe in exchange for some of that THC from last night. You liked it that much? Well, I'm not really much of a smoker, but I thought maybe I could infuse it into like a butter or an oil, something like that. Yeah, butter would work. Can make yourself some croissants. -Croissant. -What? No, nothing. Anyway, this is a British pie that I made for you. It is a tofu and peanut butter filling. Mm, I do love peanut butter. -Got a fork? -Ah, of course. What's that? Feijoada. It's a Brazilian dish. Mm, exotic. Is that the main course? No, I think it's a bit too spicy for you. Actually, I had something I wanted to ask you. Yeah, sure. Um, I've got my friends that are in town tonight and they asked if they could come and see me. Maybe come here. What? Here in the house? If that's okay with you? Yeah, sure. I'm gonna go out tonight anyway. Okay, thank you. Sacha, you left the kitchen at good time, huh? It's been crazy busy ever since you left. It's been a mess ever since you became Head Chef. But how's your hand tremor thing man? Any better? I mean, it's not great, and obviously it's not safe to work in the kitchen anymore. At least that's what they said, um... but I eat out a lot, so it's okay. 'Cause you're food critic now, that is amazing. Well, I just have a couple of food blogs, really, that's it. Oh, you must have a lot of readers, though. No? Well, I've had too much to drink. Sacha, where's your toilet? Well, there's two upstairs and one downstairs. So take your pick. Take my pick? -Take my pick. -Enjoy. Okay. One down. It's your play. Hummus is good. Huh. Huh. Did you shave today, Courtney? 'Cause you look rough. I love your dress tonight, Courtney. Does this red look good on me or does it make me look fat? What the fuck are you talking about? What else you got in here? This fucking jellyfish looking thing. Let's try some red. It's red. Oh, my God. Red really makes your eyes pop. What the fuck? What else you got in here, Julie? What the fuck are these? Fucking anal beads. Thank fuck I left you. Oh, wait, you left me. Well, thank God you fucking left me. Okay. So uh... but we spoke with this the day at work, so... Sacha. I thought you said you live with a sales man. Yes, I think that's what he does. His name is Dan. His, huh? That's interesting... because Dan, your friend Dan, kind of looks more like a Danielle right now, um... I mean, unless it's his bulky sister upstairs playing dress up. So wait, you live with a trany or something? I don't think trany is the right word, man. It's like, it's something different. Like, it's like a cross between-- - it's like a crossbreed. - A crossbreed? -A what? -Nothing on pedigree, Not pedigree. Oh, shit. Sorry, boys. I didn't mean to disturb. Uh, Sacha... I just wanted to let you know that I've got another show tonight. Mm-hmm. And, guys, if Sacha hasn't already told you, I kind of fucked up the last one. Um, but might as well try again, right? Right. Cool. Anyway, Sacha, if you want to come and watch, I can get you some tickets. Sacha's got a date. For you and your friends, if they want to come. Oh, oh, I'm-- I have to go back to the kitchen. Same thing. Kitchen. You wouldn't understand. Walking my dog. Super busy. -Sorry. -My hands are tied. Ah. All right, okay. Well it was lovely to meet you guys anyway. Cheers, goodnight. Did you see that? I don't, I don't, I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. How would you explain that? I don't know. Would you go out with a piece a paper-- I don't know. I don't know. -You knew about this? -Does he get a period? -Or she get a period? -I don't know. I don't know what the fuck that means. No, fuck you and you're a shit chef. Is he upset? You should all leave. All of you. -We're just joking, man. -You should all fuck off! It's okay, we are only joking around. No, you know what, I'll leave. Fuck you all. Sacha, come on. Is not your fault he's a trany. It is actually. Dan? Danielle, you ready? Pull it really tight. Hmm, Suck. Suck it all in. That's it. You got this. Around your neck. Hmm, cute. -Turn a bit. A bit more. -Down. Hm. Thank you very much. Put your hands together for Maria Lidze. He get a daily trapped human right here on our stage. And now for our final performance of the evening, please welcome to the stage our very own Midnight Mistresses. Let's make some noise.
