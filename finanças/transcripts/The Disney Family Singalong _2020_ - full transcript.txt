[taps shell] ["Circle of Life" plays] [male announcer] Tonight, from our living rooms to yours... Hello? [announcer] ...we come together and take a break to share in the joy of Disney and some of our favorite music... Enchanté, chérie. [announcer] ...at a time we need it most. -Do you want to build a snowman? -Go. [upbeat music] [announcer] So gather the family around... ...and join us in sharing our love of singing our hearts out to some of our beloved Disney classics for one very special evening. Be our guest, won't you? For the Disney Family Singalong. Welcome, everyone, to the Disney Family Singalong. Ryan Seacrest here, and tonight we're providing some much-needed joy by bringing us all together through our shared love of singing. We've assembled an all-star lineup of artists, and challenged them to prepare a special singalong version of one of their favorite Disney songs from the comfort of their own home. Now, they've dug deep and created something incredibly meaningful for all of us to share, and they've done it with minimal equipment. All self-shot in their own homes. Just them, a camera, and a whole lot of heart. And of course, it won't be a singalong without you singing along. We want you and your families to join in on all the fun at the top of your lungs. Yes, even you, Dad. We thought we'd start with a little vocal warmup, and who better to get our vocal cords in shape than the Tony/Emmy award-winning powerhouse performer known as Kristin Chenoweth? Kristin, take it away. Thanks, Ryan. I am so glad that I get to be the one to get you guys ready vocally for tonight. Now, to channel your inner Disney princess or prince, you need some fa-la-la-la-las. So let's start with some fa-la-la-la-la-la-la. Let's go. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la. Good. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la. One more. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la. Yes! I can hear you through my TV. [chuckles] Now that you've finally found your happy fairy-tale ending, dig deep into your core and realize that you too can have a showstopper. [sings high note] [glass shatters] Sorry. Didn't mean to do that. It just flew out. Anyway, have fun, enjoy the music, and sing pretty. Thank you, Kristin. Now that we're all fully prepped and the neighbors have been warned, what better way to kick things off than with a song from one of my all-time favorite Disney classics, Beauty and the Beast? So get ready for a spectacular self-shot performance by hugely talented Derek Hough and his girlfriend Hayley, from our living room to yours. Please, be our guest. [orchestral music] Ma chère mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now we invite you to relax. Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents... your dinner. [singing "Be Our Guest"] -[phone ringing] -[Derek laughs] Oh, Julianne's calling. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. FaceTiming me. -Hey, Jules! What's up? -Hi. Whoa, what are you wearing? Oh, we're doing, like, a Disney singalong right now with America. -Wait, that's so cute. -[laughs] Wait, why am I not invited? I want to do that. Well, you are! Go get on-- do you have a costume or something? Do I have a costume? Have you met me? [orchestral music] [music playing through cell phone] All right, let's go! Come on, Hayley! [all singing "Be Our Guest"] Now, if you have a Buzz Lightyear doll at the house, it's time to grab it, gather round the living room, and get ready to sing along to the Toy Story classic, "You've Got a Friend in Me," with Josh Groban. -["You've Got a Friend in Me" playing] -All right, America. I want to hear you sing at the top of your lungs with me. I've got some friends joining me later, and I hope you'll join me too on this very special song. [singing "You've Got a Friend in Me"] All right, I want to hear you all sing along. Come on. [all singing "You've Got a Friend in Me"] [children laughing] When's the last time you got to sing along with Christina Aguilera? Hey, stick around because that's happening in a bit. Also, a Disney Family Singalong exclusive. It's the High School Musical reunion. But right now, we have some country stars who may not be together in person but have cooked up something wonderful for us. Let's say hello to Little Big Town. In every job that must be done, there's an element of fun. Find the fun, and snap-- the job's a game. [music playing] [singing "A Spoonful of Sugar"] [all singing "A Spoonful of Sugar"] Take it away, Philly. [singing "A Spoonful of Sugar"] [singing "A Spoonful of Sugar"] Our next singalong is with the talented young actress who voiced Moana in the popular 2016 animated film, Auli'i Cravalho, checking in right now. So nice to see you. Oh, thank you so much for having me, Ryan. Now, we challenged you to come up with a singalong for us, so what song did you decide to do? I will be singing "How Far I'll Go" today, from Moana. Um, it's written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It's a song that's really close to my heart. I think it's really relatable and inspiring during these times. It's really about feeling kind of stuck where you are, but wanting more from life, and dreaming about the future, which I certainly am. Plus, I feel like a lot of people at home know the words, so it's perfect. It's the perfect fit. All right, well, thank you for doing it. All the families watching in your living room, let's see how far you can go with Auli'i, a.k.a. Moana. Take it away. [singing "How Far I'll Go"] At this moment, everyone is experiencing challenging times, so tonight we'd love to shed some light on the incredible work Feeding America is doing. -Hi, America! -Hi, America! -Hi, America! -Hey there, America. -During this crisis... -...over 37 million people... -...don't have access... -...to nutritious foods. But there is a way we can all help... with Feeding America. Their network of 200 food banks are up and running... distributing food to people and communities they serve... across the country. to locate a food bank in your community. -Together. -Together. -Together... -...let's feed the love. Hello to all of the families across the world. I'm very proud and honored to be a part of the Disney family, and to help present the Disney Songbook Singalong in partnership with Feeding America. I'd like to dedicate this song to all of the healthcare workers who've been working tirelessly to keep us healthy and safe. We greatly appreciate you. [soft piano music] [singing] When you wish upon a star Makes no difference who you are Anything your heart desires Will come to you If your heart is in your dreams No request is too extreme When you wish upon a star As dreamers do [speaking] Please hold on to your families tight. Please be safe. Don't give up hope. We're gonna get through this. I promise. God bless you. Mwah. And as this is the Disney Family Singalong, I thought I'd hand it over to the niece of one of tonight's star performers, Amber Riley. You know Amber for her work in Glee, The Little Mermaid Live, and winning Dancing with the Stars. Let's say hello to Teonie. I'm so excited to introduce my Auntie Amber, especially because she's going to sing our favorite song from Frozen. So sing along with her at the top of your lungs, and every time you belt out "Let it go," put your arms out like this and really bring it to life. Take it away, Auntie Amber. ["Let It Go" playing] [singing "Let It Go"] That was amazing. It just goes to show you, you can never underestimate a Disney fan. I wonder what this next performer has in store, so let's find out. Here to keep it going is Amber's fellow Glee star, my friend Darren Criss. Darren, thanks for coming on. How are you? Of course. I'm very well, thank you. All things aside, it's fun to celebrate music, especially Disney music, with friends, and, you know, and try and bring some smiles to some people's faces. It's a nice little escape, and I've known you a long time. I know you're a huge fan of Disney songs, so what do you have in store for us? Well, it's hard for me to decide because there's so many classics, so I tried to do one that isn't done as often, but I've been doing this song and many Disney songs in bars, cafés, restaurants, my entire adult life, so I thought I would do one of my favorites, which is from the 1967 classic The Jungle Book, the great Louis Prima's "I Wan'na Be like You," so I felt like monkeyin' around a little bit. So people will sing along with me, hopefully they can monkey around too. Oh, I think we're ready, then. Let's do it. Ladies and gentlemen, Darren Criss. A-one, two. [rhythmic tapping] -[guitar music] -[singing "I Wan'na Be like You] [monkey sounds] Are you guys ready? Because this is going to be so fun. We've challenged some super-talents from Broadway to put together a singalong just for you, so take in a breath, don't panic, relax your voice, there's gonna be some tongue-twisters, and please help me welcome my friend, Tony Award winner James Monroe Iglehart, and the Broadway cast of Aladdin to sing "Friend Like Me." Have fun. Oh. Use your breath. ["Friend Like Me" playing] Hit it! -[vocalizing] -[singing "Friend Like Me"] Ha ha ha! Sing along, y'all. No, no, no! [all singing "Friend Like Me"] Ha ha ha! [James] Come on, everybody! Sing along! As a member of the Disney family, it's my pleasure to introduce our next singalong. Performing "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" from Hercules, it's the extraordinary, unbelievable, incredible... Ariana Grande. Oh! Today I'm gonna sing "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" from Hercules because it's always been my number one favorite Disney movie, and I love Alan Menken's music, so I hope you enjoy. Mwah! [singing "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)"] On, no [Ariane vocalizes] [vocalizing] [all] Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities Forget about your worries And your strife I mean the bare necessities Old Mother Nature's recipes... [female announcer] Next, it's a big-screen, live action Beauty and the Beast reunion, plus several more Disney O.G.'s perform the classics they originated in their films. The Disney Family Singalong, and it's all coming up. Ladies and gentlemen, you know him as Olaf from Frozen, or LeFou from Beauty and the Beast, or just good old-fashioned regular legend, the one and only, Josh Gad! Oh, thank you! Thank you for that great introduction, unidentifiable Disney voiceover introduction person. And now, please welcome Luke Evans, and accompanying us on piano, the one and only, Academy Award winner Alan Menken, as we give you Beauty and the Beast's "Gaston." [playing "Gaston" on piano] [singing "Gaston"] [singing] [Alan singing] It just occurred to me that I'm in quarantine indefinitely-- does spelling last names really matter right now? [singing] Our next performer to lead us in song has been entertaining audiences for six decades. Younger kids, that's more than all your fingers and toes, okay? That's how long. He sang "I'll Make a Man Out of You" in the animated feature Mulan, and he's put together this very special singalong just for you. It is the great Donny Osmond. ["I'll Make a Man Out of You" playing] [singing] Take it, Dylan. [singing] Be a man! Be a man! Be a man! ...moon! -Great job, kids! -Bye, Papa! Papa! -Bye, guys! -Bye, Grandpa! Grandpa loves you! Great job! Hello, ladies and gentlemen, Tracee Ellis Ross here. You know, it is often in times like these, that are the most challenging, that we could all use a little bit of magic, and Disney songs are full of magic. So get ready to feel the love, because we are singing an Oscar-winning ballad from The Lion King with a woman who has a voice like no other and some Disney magic of her own. Ladies and gentlemen, it's Christina Aguilera. ["Can You Feel the Love Tonight" playing] [vocalizing] [singing] [soft chuckle] [kiss] ["Kiss the Girl" playing] Next up in our family singalong is a Little Mermaid-inspired performance by the multitalented Jordan Fisher, and he'll be joined by some very special friends. So, if you've got any bubbles laying around the house, grab 'em now because we're headed under the sea. ["Under the Sea" playing] [singing "Under the Sea"] Whoo! [applause] Pocahontas was my favorite Disney princess growing up, and the movie happens to have one of the best Disney ballads ever. Yes, I'm talking about "Colors of the Wind," and I would absolutely love it if you guys sang along with me. ["Colors of the Wind" playing] [singing] [fanfare plays] There is just one moon And one golden sun And a smile means friendship to everyone Though the mountains divide and the oceans are wide It's a small world after all -Looks good, Bill! -[female announcer] Up next, snatch your hats and scarves out of the attic-- the temperature is about to drop! A Frozen favorite is next, plus a special singalong surprise every Disney lover will go crazy over. [all] It's a small, small world -Yay! -Yay! Yay, Bill! Do you wanna build a snowman? -Yes. -You do? All right, you gonna help me sing this? Mm-hmm! [singing] [singing with laughter] Okay. [girl giggles] [singing] [girl] Walls? [girl chatters happily] Oh, it's snowing! [laughter] All right, we're gonna sing this last part real loud. Ready? [Thomas] You ready? [singing] [girl giggles] Now say bye! -Bye! -Will you wave? Now, just when you thought we couldn't give you any more "feels," I have a surprise for you. This star is hunkered down in the middle of nowhere with patchy Wi-Fi, but he does not want to miss out on tonight. He became a household name thanks to his early work as Troy Bolton in the High School Musical trilogy. It's Zac Efron. Hi, everyone, I hope that you're safe and that you're healthy, and that you're doing as well as possible during these unprecedented times. It's my greatest pleasure to introduce a musical performance by some of my oldest friends, and some new ones. I hope that you enjoy, and remember, we are all in this together. All right, thank you, Zac. Now let's hear from the man who gave Zac and so many other talented young performers their big break. Director of Newsies, Hocus Pocus, Descendants, and High School Musical, it is Kenny Ortega. Hi, everybody. What an honor it is to be sharing in this special evening with all of you. And while I'm joining in from my home like you are from yours, I am super looking forward to finishing off this singalong jam with a bang! But first, to get things started, I've got someone very special that I'd like to link in. - Hey, Kenny, what's up! - Hey, Lucas! How's it goin'? Hey, everybody. Oh, this is amazing, uh, just having us all at our homes, but we're hanging out together. It's-- it's, uh-- This is incredible. Um, but what do you say we-- we link in a few more friends?

Wait, we're missing a Wildcat! -What's up, Wildcats? -Corbin! -Whoo! -[all] Corbin! Oh, wow, this is crazy! It's so good to see you guys! [laughs] Guys, when we recorded "We're All In This Together" all those years ago, did you think that it could become the anthem that it is today? It's popping up everywhere. It's crazy! It just goes to show you, though, there is nothing like the power of music to lift up the spirit. Hey, everybody, from our homes to your homes, get ready to get your head in the game. ["We're All In This Together" playing] Ohh! Yeah, yeah Come on, now Together strong [woman] Yeah! -Yeah -Yeah, yeah Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho! All right, here we go That is right, everybody. We are all in this together, so, please, keep your spirit strong and your hopes high. That's right, Corbin. And, everyone, make good choices, which means stay at home. And remember the importance of social distancing until we're able to be together again. And before we say good night, let's give a huge shout-out and a thanks to our first responders. Our doctors and nurses and medical staff, and everyone who is out there working day and night on the front lines, doing everything they can to keep us safe. We are so grateful to you. We love you. We applaud you. [applause] -Thank you! -Thank you! [cheers and applause] -Thank you! -Thank you! That's you, Mom and Dad! [applause] -Thank you so much! -Thank you! And thanks to Kenny and the cast of High School Musical for that incredible reunion, and thank you all at home for singing along with us for the hour.
