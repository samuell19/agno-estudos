Jocelyne! Seen this? Sorry... 18 million near here! 18 million. Just think! The winner hasn't come forward. In 4 days, it's put back in play. He must be dumb! Or she... It could've been us. Honestly... I knew right away it was me. Without checking. I don't believe it... A two-euro ticket bought in Arras on the square. 18,547,301 euros. 6, 7, 24, 30 and 32. One chance in 76 million and it had to be me. I wish it had never happened. A few weeks earlier... Arras. Population: 42,000. Its belfry... A plaque on Rue du Miroir de Venise to mark the birth of Eugène François Vidocq on July 24, 1775. A few steps away... my haberdashery. For Christmas, cloths and napkins to embroider. For Mardi Gras, fancy dress patterns. After that, it's quiet until spring. That's no good... Try to sell yourself, Mum. It's for the Net, not a church sale. Let's start again... Go that way. How do you see this blog? This blog is... This blog is for women who prefer homemade to shop-bought. Here, we can exchange tips and ideas or even recipes. In short, a place to meet. It's better if you come to the shop but it's not obligatory. See you soon. - Was that good? - Excellent. I'll edit it for your home page. Great! Is it that late? Damn! Dad's really handsome in a suit! Do I look ok? Great. Go on. He hates to wait. I'll lock up. I like you like this. THE LIST OF MY DESIRES You're here today with colleagues, family and friends who wished to honour you. This service award symbolizes your contribution to our nation's wealth, to its development but also to its humanity. For, let us remember, "Work's true reward "lies not in what it allows you to earn, "but in what it allows you to become." And now the buffet is open! Not too bored? I'm happy to be with you and see your colleagues. Jo! Meet Nathalie, my wife... How do you do, Nathalie? Delighted. Congratulations, Alain. It wasn't too tough. 30 years married, 30 years in the firm. These days I'm a dying breed. But Jo's on the right track. He'll be next. - Really? - You bet! The course is going well? Better than well. He's a real leader of men. I keep telling him that. Here. Thanks. May I borrow him? Not many men know how to dance now. I hope you're not jealous, Jocelyne? Let them dream. On that level, Jo deserves an award. They're crazy about him. Personally, in his shoes... Enough, Alain. What award was it? - The 30-year one. - Not bad. I'm up to 26. A medal for 30 years with a firm. It's like war. Odd way of viewing it. But it's true. I hate you being so negative. It's a good job. You'll get promoted. We're doing well, right? - Here! - Thanks. Got the spring shirt out, Ludo? I do what I can to get noticed by you ladies. Girls. Only Jocelyne is hitched. Thanks. What's that? An awesome site. Every draw since 2008. For instance, 25 has come up 27 times. - Not bad. - No, it sucks. Like 34. Another bad one. But 5 has come up... 32 times. But 23 takes the biscuit: 49 times. So I'm playing... 23. Definitely not. Everyone will. If it comes up, you'll win peanuts. No, I'm playing 49. As in "49 times". 49! Listen to numbers. It's scientific. Listen to them. - Ludo! - Yes. Here you go! Aim for the jackpot. - And you? - Me? It's 18 million. A villa on the Riviera, a world tour, a diamond... Loads of Louboutins! No way, I'm never lucky. Lucky... What do you mean? It's not luck. This time next year, I'll be rich in the sun. - With new boobs. - Me too. They look fine. Looks can be deceiving. If we lived in outer space, weightlessness would keep our tits up. Exactly. I'm fine. Jo loves me as I am. Sure, men are all the same. A year from now, if we win, I'll install weightlessness at home. I'm not plucking pubes all my life. I'm aiming higher. Armpits? Stupid! Come on... Think of your kids. What'll you leave them? A stock of zippers? Come on, get to work. All right. Don't look at what I'm playing. I know you. - These two? - Yes. Like this. - Is it pretty? - Very. Two metres of each. For a house jacket. Do you want me to add a strip of ribbon? Yes, good idea. That'll be nice. - I'll order it, Mrs Viguier! - No, "Lucette62". That's my login on your blog! You posted the olive cake recipe! A customer said it was delicious. Pleased to hear it. Do you need a deposit? No, I know you. By Tuesday. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye, Mrs Viguier! Hello. Are you Jocelyne Guerbette? Juliette Merval, from the local paper. - I'd like to interview you. - Me? About your blog. 2,000 subscribers in less than 2 months, 1,200 connections a day and rising... How do you explain it? I can't explain it. I... I'm a bit out of my depth but it's nice. But could it be a matter of touch? Perhaps? Do you think people suffer in... Do you think people suffer in modern society from the lack of contact? Has the virtual killed the tactile? The erotic even? People used to keep diaries. Now they write blogs. - You kept a diary? - Like everyone. I have no answers to your questions. I'm sorry. Well, I... I have to tell you... My mum's been alone 10 years. She gets up at 6, makes coffee, waters her plants, drinks her coffee, washes and, by 7 o'clock, her day is over. A month ago, she heard about your blog. Now, thanks to your trimmings and your pompoms, she chats on your blog, she asks neighbours round. So don't say you have no answers. You do people good. You realize that, don't you? I've caught you unprepared. It's not that. I've never thought about it. Know what? Think it over and I'll come back for your answers. Ok? Can I count on you? A lot of people do. See you soon, Jocelyne. Goodbye. Of course I kept a diary with tiny hearts as dots over the "i"s...
