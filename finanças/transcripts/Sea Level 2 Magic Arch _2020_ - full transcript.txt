I'm happy to give the floor to anglerfish Udo, 'cause they complain that we always dismiss the opposition and never let them speak. Hah. We're listening. My dear mayor, we all actually remember what you promised us before the elections. Well, but nothing ever came out of that. For example, what about street lights? You promised all of us fish that nights would be as bright as day, but many streets in our town are still very dark, and your beloved citizens still get bumps and bruises. Yes, indeed. Some of the lights are still missing, that's true. But we conducted an investigation that showed your own employees from AnglerLights, who, as we know, report to you, my dear sir, have themselves taken out those bulbs. Mm...

Three days ago, soccer fans trashed half a block after the final match of Tuna vs. Codfish. [chattering] Hmm, well, I admit, that did happen, yes. But we found out that the reason for that... [chuckles] was an unlicensed betting house, as the fans had not received their winnings. And we tend to believe that the game was organized by some... unknown anglerfish. A coincidence? I don't think so. [chattering] Well, me... I-I've heard... I know for a fact that the wedding of our famous elite dolphin guard Alpha and your stepdaughter has been financed from the town budget. Am I right, Mr. Mayor? You want to have fun at our expense? No, it's you, Udo! You're desperately trying to fish out some lucre from the town budget. But I'll make sure your angle never gets there.

He then found another pyramid within the fortress with another arch in it. Dolphius decided to try it out with another stone. The stone disappeared. ♪♪ And Dolphius assumed that this arch sends things to the future. Consequently, if he goes back to the past, he would be able to come back. He wanted to try his theory out. That's just incredible! Auntie Demetra, you're a genius! Unbelievable! Finally, I know where my father went. Did he, by any chance, say where the tunnel was? Where? Where? Yeah, he did. That's right. It's... it's near some funny thing. I've been laughing for three days straight! [laughing] Or was it four days? Ah... Near the legged fish! - [laughing] - Yeah, that's really funny. Thank you, we got it now. My pleasure. And don't forget to tell your little son hi, Dolphius. Uh-huh, he sure will. I'll remind him. [Morenius] Well, well, well... It's marvelous, isn't it? It's absolutely fantastic! I don't believe my eyes! [chuckles] So, you're saying that this magic arch turned you into a giant? That's correct, my underwater Majesty. Bob and Pete are guarding it. I love it when the day ends with some delightful news. Fish Town will soon be ours. And I will call it Moray-ville! Hooray! Long live Moray-ville! - Long live Morenius! - [all] Long live Morenius! [Alpha grunts] We barely got away. Somehow those morays transformed themselves into huge monsters. So Delphi was telling the truth. - [mumbling] - Okay, we need a plan. I know exactly what to do. You, Alpha, had enough chances to prove your worth, but you failed. Seahorses, your opinion. [seahorse neighs] Well, we could let's say, hide somewhere? That's not a plan! Fish Town is in actual, imminent danger. Manta, do you perhaps have a suggestion? Hm, I have an idea. We could somehow slowly adapt, grow lungs, learn to breath air. Eventually, our fins would turn to legs, and we could all become land dwellers. - Too evolutionary! - [chattering] Is there anybody else? We... we have a plan! - I'm sure there's a way-- - Not you again! This is all his fault since the very beginning. If it hadn't been for Delphi, Mia would be completely safe. Now that you mention it, Alpha, Mia would never have gone to the old fortress if you had followed Octavian's order like you should-- That's enough! It doesn't matter who should be blamed for this. Fish Town is in danger, and we need a plan! That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you! We have a plan. [clears throat] Fine then. You may speak. My father found a secret passage into the old fortress, and inside, there're two more arches that make it possible to time travel! We need to go back in time where there're no giant morays. Then we can get bigger, and leap in time to now, and kick the morays' tails! I think that Manta's plan is much more likely to happen. - [all chattering] - [sighs] Your plan is absolute nonsense. Admit it, Delphi. Do you need me to tell you again? Your Dad disappeared and never came back. There's no way he should be our inspiration. - Yeah, but-- - No more "buts." Now, listen to my plan. The morays will definitely come back to the fortress to get transformed and become invincible. We have to fight them before it happens. The fortress and the town can only be accessed from the north or the south. We're protected by underwater rocks from the east and west. They won't attack from the south because they would have to make a long trip lasting a few days. So that means the morays will be attacking from the north. They will take the shortest way through a mountain range, with only one narrow passage. We have to meet them in this very passage. The morays don't know that we have figured out their plan. We'll defeat the morays, and then we'll get back to the fortress, and save Mia! [all chattering] At last. A plan! - Trumpeters, sound the horns! - [horns playing] [all chattering] It's not gonna work! Hey, it's not gonna work! - [dolphin] Shut up, Delphi. - This plan will fail! One of them is really enormous. Please, Octavian. Believe me, it's important. ♪♪ Fine, then. I'll go back in time myself. - Alone. - No, I'm going with you. It's too dangerous. What if I'm wrong? Do you understand we might never come back? What do you mean, bro? [chuckles] We will get back. I believe in you. - You do? - Of course. [chuckles] What other choice do I have? Then let's go! [groans] ♪♪ We're losing time. Where could this tunnel be? Maybe Demetra made some kind of mistake? What? Aunt Dementia? Mistaken? [laughs] No way. You're wrong. That can't be. Her sharp mind can be an example to... Hold on a sec. Didn't that look like a... Look here! There's a sign on the stone. Just like the one on the arch. You've got a good eye, Zeb. Okay, and what will happen if I try and... No, no, no! What? Don't do that! We should not... [yelps] [door creaking] Hello? Is anybody there? [voice echoes] Uh... maybe you go first and then me? You see, because, uh, you're the muscles, and I am the brain. And the brain must be taken care of. Oh, yeah? [chuckles] You're right. [screaming] ♪♪ Look, it must be the entrance to the pyramid. Let's swim. [rumbling] - Uh-oh. - Let's get outta here! [both screaming] Delphi, there's something I have to tell you. Do you remember how you lost your Dolph-cathlon cards when you were kid? Well, you didn't lose them. They were stolen. Who stole them? [panting] What are you talking about? One very little, but very nice fish! He wanted to give them back to you, but never got a chance to because... [screams] ...a huge ball squeezed him into clam chowder! No, it didn't! [screams] Phew. I think I now know the origins of the flatfish. ♪♪ Holy mackerel! Where are we? Where we need to be. Look over there. This is it. The arch that sends you into the past. And here's the stone that he threw. It's just like Demetra told us. The second pyramid is out there and in it, the arch that will bring us back to now. Listen, maybe we can just transform now without any time travel. I'm not afraid, but the morays may be asleep-- No, it's way too risky. If they notice us, we'll become fish and chips. Uh, another idea. You swim in there, and I'll stay here. Here, I'll handle all the hard work. That's right. I will, by myself, make sure our mission runs smoothly. And you... [chuckles] You'll be safe there. And you'll get back to me at once. [chuckles] Uh, but just in case, my friend, goodbye. Okay, now I have to do it. Goodbye, Zeb. Delphi, uh, you're not serious about this, are you? ♪♪ [screaming] Delphi, stop, don't do it. You have to try it out first! [grunts] [gasps] Delphi! Delphi, where are you? He's gone. He really went back in time. [gasps] And I thought it was all nonsense. I shouldn't have let him go alone. He'll get into hot water, like he always does, and I'll have to chill it.

It was my battle-cry. I just didn't want to leave you alone here. You'd better stay. It seems we have a serious problem here, Zeb. - A problem? - Yeah. We're inside the pyramid, but the exit is blocked. [straining] It's no use, Zeb. I already tried myself. Uh... Let's agree right away, okay? No matter how hungry you get, you won't eat me. Some of my ancestors, you know, were really poisonous! We have a deal, Delphi? Delphi? My son! - Dad? - You're here! I don't believe it. Is that you? And I started to think I had lost you. I missed you so. Whoa, Mr. Dolphius. And we thought you kind of turned into fish food. Hello, Zeb. How did you two get here? You won't believe it. We went through the hidden tunnel, found the arch, and... Oh, I see. Exactly what I feared. Delphi, let me explain. The exit from this pyramid in our time is open, but in the past it's somehow locked. I just haven't managed to open it. But we can try to swim through the tunnel. I've tried it, but that exit is blocked, too. And why don't we try swimming through the arch one more time? Mm-mm. It doesn't work. That means now we're trapped. Unfortunately. But I'm so proud of you, my son, that you could find me. I've been digging a new tunnel for a year. Maybe you can help me with this. But we have no time for a tunnel. No time? But why?
