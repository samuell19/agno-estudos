You guys have gotta see this, really. It's about time to get back out of your house-- [drum beat] [fuzzy electronic music] [dog yapping] [water running] [bubbly electronic music] [water running] [evan crying out] OK, OK, OK. Just calm down. Calm down, calm down. [brakes squealing] [bell ringing] [drummy music] I need this refilled. Doctor Pencian gives me refills all the time. OK. I'm sorry this says no refills. I'm sure he called it in. I need a prescription. You should call your doctor tomorrow morning, and have him recall in your prescription. EVAN: That is not acceptable. [bell ringing] You're not getting this tonight-- not without a prescription. EVAN: Did you hear me say that this is unacceptable? And did you hear I said come back tomorrow morning. EVAN: I'd like to speak to a manager. Manager-- mister, listen. It's 2:00 AM, and I'm the only one here. Now get the hell outta here-- I'm not refilling you no illegal prescription. EVAN (LOUDLY WHISPERING): Illegal? I have the bottle right there! That says no refills! I'm not in the mood to put up with this bullshit! I am coming back here tomorrow, and I will be speaking to your supervisor. You do that, junkie-man. You tell him how I wouldn't give you yo' fix. Yes, you do that mister plinkin' junkie-man. Shit. Hey. Hi. You're on TV. What? You are on TV. Yes, that's me. I was just flipping the channels earlier tonight before I came out-- there you were. Just talking about TVs and video cameras. And, bam, here you are-- right in front of me. It's so cool. I'm Simon. Evan. I have no idea where I am. My roommate, Rem, invited me to this party with tons of blow. People were talking shit, turning tricks. So I kept drinking but I must have been dosed because there was this blow-up doll, it started talking to me. So I ran outside for some air. That's when I noticed some dude totally fell off the balcony; everyone just ran. And now I have no clue where I am. Excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Evan, are you taking a cab home by any chance? I'm gonna go now. Hey. Fuck, it's cold. Well, thanks man. Are you OK? Oh, god, I'm so stupid. No, it's just my stupid nose. My nose bleeds at the drop of a hat. Well should I call an ambulance? No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I just-- I get these all the time. Well wait-- maybe they can take me home. Pfft. [train rolling along] Well it's not really a palace, it's more of a place-- small apartment. I know I have some Band-Aids in here somewhere, though, or maybe some gauze. I don't think I've used a Band-Aid myself in like 10 years. Maybe you're like a superhero? Yeah, infomercial man-- can sell crap out of anything. Did you know that bar soap can get you 10 times cleaner than the leading shower gel? It's like you really have to make anything sound better than anything else. Look at me, I'm sitting here and you're bleeding. Why do you do that? Do what? The blinking-- is it like a tick or something? Uh, I guess. I like it. So how's your nose? Um, good. Thanks. Oh, don't thank me. I'm the reason you're here. Look, uh, you're really sweet but you're too young. Ah, fuck this. [creepy singing] Tell me I feel too young. This isn't comfortable. Are you comfortable? I'm fine. Let's go in the other room. Oh, wait, hold on. [gargling] Calm down, calm down! Are you a top? What? The top. Does it have to be decided right now? [belt jingling] What are you doing? Just rub it. Just rub it against it. OK. I wanna put it in. Wait, no condom. It's all right, there's no lube, it's not going to go in. Just play with it. It feels like it's going in. Just put the head in. Wait, wait, I'm going to get a condom. Oh my god, are you OK? What? Jesus, my sheets. What? Here, here. Oh my god-- did I get any on-- sorry. It's not safe. There's too much blood. Fuck! Oh, fuck! Fuck. Fuck. Shush. Oh, fuck. Shut up. Uh, fuck. Shh! Oh, wait a minute. Shut up! Oh, oh! [moaning sounds] You stopped blinking. [distorted music] MALE PROSTITUTE SOLICITOR: OK, those pants are much more appropriate for work. Much more professional. Now the shirt still isn't right though. Just throw your stuff over there, you can get it later. Brett was right, you look like a Norwegian surfer. I can't wait to do this. What's your name? Simon. MALE PROSTITUTE SOLICITOR: Well Simon, here's the deal. We're going to play office and then you're going to mess around with me. Think you're up for that? I don't know. MALE PROSTITUTE SOLICITOR: Oh, you'll get the hang of it. Don't you worry. OK, that shirt's just not going to work though, because that's not a work shirt. You want to-- here, just take-- take your shirt off. Let's just say I work at this small company and I'm the office manager. And then there's this, um, mail clerk. We'll just say his name's, I don't know, Christian. And when he hands the mail to me he smiles at me, you know. And-- and there's something in that smile that I know he doesn't give that smile to the other workers. So I want you to be-- you're Christian. And you come in here into my office. And you're-- and you're all alone. And I accidentally left out an issue of "Honcho" over here, and you get so, kind of, fascinating-- I know we didn't discuss that. I know we didn't. But after I come in and see you, that's when you're going to give your ass to me. No. And you can keep the clothes. No. How about if I go up to $250? OK. MALE PROSTITUTE SOLICITOR: So I end up coming in here, and I catch you with it and your pants are off. Come on, why not? [music playing] What the fuck are you doing, man? Gross. Why are you home so early? What's with the clothes? Ow. Oh, did your john rough you up? I got a nosebleed. OK, look-- are you going to be able to pay me rent this week or what? Hey, it's Frank. Uh, listen, um, I was just thinking about you today, and I was really thinking that we should get together because I hadn't seen you in a long time and shoot the shit and stuff. Yeah, so gimme a call as soon as you get this, bye. Yeah. Yeah, look. I wanted to ask you something. Yeah, sure, I'll hold on. Look, what are you doing tonight? OK. Yeah, that's fine. No, that's fine. So do you have any meth? Or do you know where I can get some? All right, let's go to the phones. Oh my god. Simon, get the fuck out here. Simon, now. What? Get in here, he's on. You know, he looks better on TV. EVAN: You purchased the camera? Congratulations, you made a great investment. He stopped blinking. Thank god you noticed that; what the fuck was that? So what did you do with him? He bone you or what? What? Come on, why won't you tell me? Come on, you can't tell me? He stopped blinking after we did it. Did what-- beat the shit out of you? What? You come in here with your face all fucked up-- what am I supposed-- He took care of me, Rem. He was really great about the whole thing. And then, after we were done, he stopped blinking. He just stopped. I really feel like I helped him. It was fucking hot. REM: Well, if all that's true, then why hasn't he come back for more? Well, he's just busy. Too busy for a $100 pole smoke? No, he's on television and stuff. EVAN: What do you plan on using it for? MALE BUYER: Documentation. Documentation? Are you a filmmaker? REM: I think he's really fucked up. That's great. You know, people are making their own movies these days. All you really need is this camera and a computer. You could make a romantic comedy. Should be right back online here, just a little sound issue. A month? I cannot wait a month for this prescription, all right? Well can you give me something until then? What is your name? No, tell me your name right now, OK! [BACKGROUND ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] [phone ringing] Hello? Hey, Simon? Is that offer still good? Yeah. I really could take you up on it, I just need to calm down. You know? OK. What's this? Oh my god! Thank you, thank you so much. Hey, slow down. Tell me you-- Jen, I'm on television, I don't need to think. I just need to look good. Oh, gimme a break. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Stop it please. Fuck. Stop it. Stop what? That fuck stuff, it's distracting. Fuck? Fuck's not distracting, fuck's hot. Simon, please. Are you OK? I'm fine, just no more swearing, OK? Are you religious? [laughter] Here. Shut me up. But let me up a few times so I don't pass out. What? So we're both happy. What are you doing? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up! You stopped blinking. Yeah. You're welcome. You think this is because of you? This has nothing to do with you. I took four Valium, four beautiful Valiums. No, it wasn't you at all. Hey. Come 'ere. Here. You know why I like you? Because you have a beautiful frown. Some people have beautiful smiles-- you have a beautiful frown. That's why I like you-- because you're so sad. That's why I like you too. I'm not sad. [fire sounds] [car honking] [upbeat electronic music] [struggling sounds] Come on, do it for a minute this time. A minute is nothing, quit being a fucking pussy. That fuckin' hurt. [banging sounds] [rock music playing] neat to move [applause] [fast knocking] What? Do you have a cigarette that Evan can borrow? Why didn't Evan ask me himself? He didn't wanna bother you. Well, so he like gets you to bother me for him? Classic. Do you have a cigarette? No. Go away, I need some space. I'm writing a song. Hey, hey, uh, Simon, are you going to watch the finale to "Hard Drive" tonight? No smokes. Should have figured he wouldn't give me any. There's a really cool TV show and on tonight, you wanna watch it? What's the show about? [phone ringing] Hello? Yeah. Hello? Hey, Simon, I have a question for you. Why are you calling me from a room away? Can you call Brett and ask him to get me some meth? He's clean now, he just got out of rehab. Well, well he still has the numbers right? That's not cool, Rem. EVAN: You know, some would say that using drugs is a way to escape from your life. That's because I'm trying to escape from a horribly depressed life, asshole. So will you call him? No! Well, why don't you invite him to watch the show tonight? No, you freak him out. Is he coming? Are you coming? No Why not, it's a really good show? I have to work. Oh. I'm gonna take a shower, do you have to use the bathroom? I'll take $50 off your rent this month if you call him. Don't do that to me, Rem, that's too mean. $50. I don't even know if he'll cooperate. He'll cooperate. BRETT (WHISPERING): Hello? SIMON: Hey, it's Simon. BRETT (WHISPERING): Yo, what's up? EVAN: Why are you whispering? BRETT (WHISPERING): I'm working. EVAN: How was rehab? BRETT (WHISPERING): Oh no, I gotta bounce, dude. I sucked this straight guy off in group therapy and after he came he got all uptight and laid into me. So I pinned him down and bit into his nutsack. [laughter] EVAN: Awesome. BRETT (WHISPERING): Aw, you miss me baby? EVAN: Whatever. BRETT (WHISPERING): BRETT: Ah, come on. Why you holding out on me? EVAN: You know I don't fuck my friends. You know that. Anyway, the finale to "Hard Drive" is on tonight, and I wanted you to come over and watch. BRETT (WHISPERING): Oh, fuck yeah! No, I love that show. EVAN: The boy is so beautiful. BRETT (WHISPERING): But who do you think the chick is that he's talking with online? EVAN: We're going to find out tonight. The commercials have been saying it's not who we think. [violins playing] Oh! That's insane. I-- I don't get it. Dude, the modem isn't plugged in-- he was talking to his computer the whole time. What? Are you retarded? There is no Samantha. His actual computer is in love with him. Wow, the whole time he thought he was, like, relating to somebody and he wasn't at all. He's completely alone. This show's genius. Do you wanna see something funny? Wait, save it till next week. It's the season finale, fuckhead. [electronic music playing] Shit, he's not on. Well, he's coming back by now. Wait, your boyfriend works for that TV show? Oh, please don't call him a boyfriend. He is my boyfriend. Gross. Simon likes 'em old. What the fuck is that? That's Evan. You gave him a key without asking me? [moaning sounds] Ow, ah. Yeah. Then he fuckin' said don't touch me in the shower. And I was like, why are you hard and staring at me? Oh. And he fuckin' decked me. What are we doing? What? Did you bring any stuff? Oh, you mean stuff, stuff. No, I'm trying to cut that out. Besides, I'm broke. How about-- [screaming] -Oh-- -Don't. But I-- Dude, trust me, OK. There's nothing going on in there that he doesn't want going on. And he wouldn't appreciate if you walked in right now, you know what I'm saying? So I'm going to just turn this off, call your friend. OK, let's go. Come on, chop, chop. EVAN: Did I do that to you? What? EVAN: Did I do that? I'm not being careful. I'm sorry. It doesn't really hurt. Where are you going? EVAN: Home. I have to go over this new camera I'm going to demo tomorrow night. I'm going to be there all day. Well can't you still stay over? EVAN: I'll call you tomorrow. We'll talk then. Actually, why don't you come in, and I'll have Jen put something over that. I'm sorry. Are you mad at me? Just go. EVAN: Well, I don't wanna go until you say you're not mad at me anymore. Well then I won't say it and you'll stay. No, Simon don't. OK, just let go. Come on, Simon, Simon! Jesus Christ. I'll call you tomorrow, OK? [phone ringing] Hello? MALE PROSTITUTE SOLICITOR: Hey, your friends are on their way over. We're going to cook up some special k, are we're going to have ourselves a private after party. I hate after parties. MALE PROSTITUTE SOLICITOR: Ah, cut that shit out, come on. Get your tight little ass over here. I have a boyfriend. MALE PROSTITUTE SOLICITOR: He doesn't have to know a thing. And if you don't tell your two friends, I'll slip $100 if you show up, because you're my favorite. All right, here we go. You ready to play a game? We're going to get wild, you ready to get wild? Yeah, what do ya' want me to do? All right here is what we're going to do. All right, I have this scenario in my head-- you're like this robber. You're like a burglar. OK, and I have a hat for ya. Yeah, over here. This is the hat. I want you to put this hat on. And so you're this burglar, uh-huh. That's exactly right and gimme a sexy look, come on. And, oh hello. Come on in. I didn't think you would get here that fast. We just started. OK, he's the burglar, and and you're the person whose house he's stealing. So it's late at night. So take your shirts off. Get the shirts off, keep the hats on. Shirts off, hats on. OK, but you know actually, I think maybe you should be wearing something pink. And you should be wearing something green. Green will be a good color for you. I think they would look good together. OK, so, now you've robbed his house, and you've killed his mother. And so I want you to pull him towards you, because you're gonna-- aw, the pink and green look great together! I think they look great. OK, so, so you're going to kill him, but something happens. You kill him-- I mean you pull him, you pull him to you. But you look at each other and-- don't look at me, look at him-- and you look at each other. And you're so cute, and he's so cute that you just-- you can't kill him. And instead of killing him, you slowly start-- yeah, yeah, that's what you do. That's perfect. That's perfect. OK, so you have to kill him. And he's going to-- and you, you, I want you-- but you're in love with him. You're in love with him, and he is going to kill you. Is this for real? MALE PROSTITUTE SOLICITOR: I used to be a cop, you know. I used to pick up boys like you all the time. Here, why don't you put that gun down and come over here and take off your pants. MALE PROSTITUTE SOLICITOR: Oh, hot tamale. Oh, look at that package. Nice package there. All right, lay down next to the gun. Yeah, gimme that look in your eyes. I wanna eat your ass. Until I can-- [buzzer sounds] Woo! The K's ready! MALE PROSTITUTE SOLICITOR: Until I can taste your intestines. I like how say he is. He's always crying. Boys are so much cuter when they're crying. Like on Rape Division when that guy was crying afterwards. What's that? A TV show. It's a really good show that only deals with rape crimes. Like the other night, there was this fag cop who was raped years ago, and then he's going at with his new boyfriend. And they're fucking, and he hears the same moans-- the exact same moans as the guy who raped him. BRETT: Wow. And people think television is bad. Like a movie or a play is so much better. It's higher on the scale-- but it's not. It's just that you have a lifetime, you have a lifetime to watch the characters change all around. You can't do that with a movie. I never thought about it like that. You're smart. SIMON: How'd you get your black eye? Rehab. How'd you get yours? Whoa! Shh, shh! Get some lube! [struggling noises] I'm gonna come real fast. I'm gonna come real fast. You're-- ow! Ow! Ow, Ow! Can I have some of this? Thank you. All right, all right. All right. OK. That's looks pretty good. You're ripping my-- [struggling noises] You know, I don't have to be doing this. Wait a minute. I really don't, you know. This is all just life experience. I don't need this. See, I'm gonna be a big rock star. One day you'll see my name in lights, and you'll be able to say, I sucked his fuckin' dick. Aw, you two are so fucking cute. I got your game. Thought you could sneak a little fun without me. Well fooled you. I even got the whole thing on tape. So, uh, Simon, you, uh, chargin' him for that I hope? [laughter] You have your period. CONDUCTOR VOICEOVER: Doors closing. Kimball is next. No, I can't. I can't. I have diarrhea. Well what are you doing? Why are we doing this? Why am I even over here? I told you I was going to go see a movie with Jen. I'm sorry. What movie were you going to see? I don't know, she's deciding. Can I come? No, this is me paying her back for getting me another bag of pills. Turn this shit off, you're only watching it because the guy takes off his shirt. Will you let me watch my stories, cunt? Don't call me that. I love how that word can still get under girls' skin. Like hole. Hole is a good one too. Like, shut up, hole. It just deems a woman to nothing. She's nothing. She's a void. That's great. Don't start acting like you can't say cunt just like you can't say fag. Do you love me? Was that supposed to hurt my feelings? Shut up, crazy hair. All right, fag. I wanna hear you say it. [knocking] JEN: We're gonna go. We're talking. I'll be out in a minute. I can see why Evan's friends with you. Really? You're not a happy person. Gimme one of those. I only have three left. Three? You could at least lie and say you only had one. Gimme one. Give me one. And I'm the unhappy one. It's OK. I've come to terms with it. I was happy for a little while, before my mom died. For a little while everything came together in a way that made me forget about everything else sucked. It's OK. I'm OK with being unhappy. JEN: When did your mom die again? Three and a half years ago. You know, I was depressed way before she too. All right? And I fucking hated her. And now everybody's like, oh, poor Rem, he's so sad because his mom's dead. And I'm just, fuck her, she did it on purpose. I'm not going to let her fuck me up from beyond the grave with that passive-aggressive bullshit. You know, no matter what you do, you're always just either a happy person or an unhappy person. And there's nothing you can do about it. Don't listen to what Oprah says about finding your spirit-- it's bullshit. It's like how fat people never lose weight, ever. It's like those two schmucks over there. Who, Simon and Evan? Yeah. Simon has always been like, oh, if only I could find a boyfriend, I'd be so happy. So he meets Evan, and he's happy for like a second, and then he's right back to being depressed again. So Simon's unhappy with Evan? Simon's just unhappy, period. Does Evan know this? Who doesn't know about this? Look, I don't wanna talk about this any more, OK? Just read your fuckin' magazine. Come on! God. You're so fucked up. Oh, I'm fucked up? Dude, We're not talking about how fucked up I am. That's been established. We're talking about how fucked up you are. And let me tell you I don't even understand why this guy is still around. He's a freak. No one else is into it. He's into it. He gets it. Shut up. I know you think he's gross, but he's giving and he's smart. What? No, he's not smart. Don't you dare say he's smart. You don't get it. No, I do get it. Why don't you just dump him? Your life is not a TV show. You don't get it. Why would anyone want their life to be like a TV show? I mean, at least aim for a movie. [phone ringing] Pick up the phone. Hey Rem. Yeah, it's Brett. Yeah, um, I'm going need some help. No, no. Oh yeah, coke's fine. Coke's fine. Coke's good. OK. Soon. Yeah. OK. Mm-hmm. OK, bye. Oh, yeah. Coke's cool. Coke's cool. [rock music playing] EVAN: Simon! Simon, now. You like them fat and long and white. And that's how I'm gonna make them for ya. OK. You wanna go first? Yes. [laughter] It's like candy from a baby. Ah, that feels good. Phew! This one's starring Aidan Shaw-- that's, like, the same guy from Sex and The City. I better-- do you think that guy's hot? You're talkative. Oh, he shuts up on it. I don't why. It just make me talk and talk and talk. Hey, are we going out tonight? You wanna go out? Yeah, I don't care. Wanna come with us? Oh my god, that's almost as good as mine. Let it go, Evan's picking me up. Look at this cock! Oh, I'm sorry-- did you want-- OK. See ya. See ya. OK, just one more. EVAN: I mean I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing it for you. Jesus. I mean I know, it's probably none of my business, so I don't-- just shut up about it, it's none of my business. I don't even know. I don't even know what I'm saying. But I just, you know, work today was really annoying and stuff, I don't know. Simon, your nose is bleeding. I'm sick of not being happy. So we'll get some tissue. Don't get it on the upholstery, OK? There's some Kleenex in the back. You get it? Simon, watch out. Simon! [cars honking] [car beeping] SIMON: Can I fuck you? Can I fuck you? That's not hot. That's just not hot. I mean, if you want to do it, then just do it. Just fuck 'im. I like it when a guy looks at me-- and he looks at me, and he wants me so bad. He thinks I'm so beautiful that he doesn't care if I wanna fuck or not. A pussy will just settle for cuddling. A real man takes it. A real man will rape you. [piano playing] [choir singing] AUNT JUSTINE: Jeremy? What? AUNT JUSTINE: How are you? Aunt Justine. AUNT JUSTINE: It is so good to see you. Yeah. AUNT JUSTINE: How've you been? Oh, we missed you at Christmas. Yeah well I kinda had other plans, so-- You talk like a girl. AUNT JUSTINE: Hey, stop that. This is your cousin. Yeah well I'm kind of on my way somewhere, so-- Oh, I'm not letting you get away that easy. Nope, sorry, I gotta go. Come have lunch. Oh, there's a message on the machine from Rem. He called three times this week. He wants you to call him. Are you gonna call him? I will. EVAN: I'm gonna take a bath. What do you want for breakfast? Surprise me. SIMON: Evan, I can't make pancakes. I don't care, just make something else. SIMON: Well what do you want me to make? I don't give a damn, just make something. Jeez. [man singing] Wait, what's your major? Psychology. I was thinking maybe I could go into youth counseling. [laughter] What? You'd probably molest them. Well maybe I could just counsel the ugly kids. I hate kids That's just because you have to make them up all day. I miss my days at I Win TV. Do you ever see him? Who, Evan? Yeah. No. REM: I saw him last night on TV. He's selling anti-telemarketing equipment now. I tried calling them like six months ago, but Simon never called me back. They're in happy couple land. Fuck that. I hate happy people.
