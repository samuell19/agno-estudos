[interposing voices] Do you see this razor? I tell you, words cannotexpress my love for this razor. This is the Rolls Royce ofrazors, did you know that? [razor buzzing] It glides across your face like a hovercraft. It's cordless, light as a feather, too. And talk about a close shave! I tell you, if it was any closer, I'd have to sell it as a vibrator. What are you laughing at?[laughing] I tell you, the first time I used this razor, I liked it so much, I went outand knocked off the warehouse. Seriously though, 70 quid up at the town. Needless to say, I'm not asking 70. I'm not asking 60 or 50 even. I'm not asking 40. I'm not asking 30 for this beautiful machine. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to let it go for 10. Who'll give me 10 pounds for it?- Here, here! Eddie! Eddie, over here! Oh, the hell with it then. I'm feeling generous. And that's a dangerous trait in my profession, I don't mind telling you. There was an old trader called Patsy Murphy who died of it last year, you know? In fact, that's what theyput on his tombstone. Here lies Patsy Murphy who died of generosity on the 24th of May. But I'm a man who likesliving dangerously, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do-- I'm going to let this go for a fiver. And I'm going to throw inthis little hand mirror, so you can watch your lilywhite skin while you're at. Did I say a fiver? No, I meant 3. Yes, 3 pounds! Who'll give me 3 pounds for it?Yes! Sold all right to the scruffylittle man down at the back. And boy, do you need it. Here, Dermot, don't forget his mirror. Who's is the fairest in the land? I don't think so. [knocking] How's it going, Raymie? How's it going? Who'll give me two pounds-- please, sir, don't put your hand up till you know what I have on me mind. [laughing] For you might not want what I'm selling. And if I point to you and youhave your hand in the air, then I want me money regardless! [laughing] Dropped a fellow in the[inaudible] the other night. Went done like a ton of bricks. Broke a bone in me hand. Story of my life-- even when I win, I lose. Listen, uh-- uh-- I haven't managed to shift that other thingyet-- like, you know? And, uh-- I don't want to doanything hasty or anything. I mean, another couple of days should do it. But sure, it's been a week already, Raymie. I mean, you don't write and you don't phone. I mean, what am I supposed to think, like? Who'll give me 2 quitfor whatever's on me mind? Anybody? Yes. You're prepared to give me two pounds for whatever's on me mind. Well, supposing I was to tellyou I have nothing on me mind. So it's only 2 quid. Fair enough. Dermot, go and get me money. I wish everybody was like you. I would be a millionaire by now. As it happens, I do have something on me mind. As it happens, this is yourlucky day cause I'm going to give you this alarm clock. And I'm going to throw in this set of bone china for the parlor, perfume from Paris for behind your ear, someaftershave for the man in your life, a portable phone, so you can give him a bell any time youfeel like checking up on him! [laughing] A toolbox for the handyman. I thought said you were handy? I am handy. I only live around the corner. [whistling] I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you-- I'm going to give until tomorrowto get the money for me. RAYMIE: Tomorrow? Aye, tomorrow. Wednesday, right? Huh? Tomorrow's Thursday. Thursday? Are you sure? I thought-- thought tomorrow was Wednesday. Thursday. Well, in the case, Raymie,I'm afraid you're out of luck. Huh? [grunting] A track suit, a box full ofthe latest videos, an umbrella! And what about this beautifulornament for the mantelpiece? Polar bear with young. Sheets and pillow cases. DERMOT: What are you doing? I'm going to needanother bag there, Dermot. What are you doing? You'll ruin the stuff. That's enough. Just get me another bag, will you? A Walkman! A duvet cover! Two electric blankets-- an over and an under! And what about this beautiful lampshade, eh? Take it easy with that shade, Dermot. It's fragile. Like your brain. [laughing] Thanks. Can I see you again some time? I don't know about that. I'm married. Give us your number anyway. Sure, who knows? You see the miracles I perform here. Now I'm finished piddling around. I'm here to make money. And any man, woman, or child who is not prepared to spend at least50 quid in this shop today should leave here and now! Go on! Beat it! Go back from whence you came andquit wasting my time here cause I'm going to lock the doors now and we're going to do some real business! I'm looking for 50 pounds a headfrom each and every one you! And then I'm going to takethe lot of you on a short trip up the Zambuzzi River and you'regoing to come back with a boat load of bargain freganzinnis! Freganzinnis! No one leaves here empty handed. In fact, some of yous will need help! Eddie! Eddie! Over here, Eddie! Lock the doors! They're coming in the windows! [music playing] I tell you, if I didn't haveto hand this over every day, I'd be laughing off [inaudible]. But I swear to god, itbreaks me bloody heart, boy. Yeah? Say nothing to your uncle about this. What do you take me for, eh? Say nothing to no one about it. All right. Stop fussing, will you? Right! Trojan Eddie has come to town! [dog barking] [music playing] What do you know? The wanderers are home from the hills! How's it going, boys? [dog growling] Leave the load up for next week. Yeah. Here you go. [laughing] [laughing] Start loading her up, will you? Take as many of those what-do-you-call-its as you can find. Since when did you startgiving orders around here? Eh, boy? Huh? Where's the money? [dog barking] Is dad around? He's up above. Why? Oh, I just wondered. Yeah. Well, don't. DERMOT: All right, Eddie? Yeah. All right. Hi, man. [music playing] Had a visit from the powers this morning, looking for the money. I got this big, old,antique wardrobe off them a couple weeks ago there. So give it back it to them. I've already sold it,sure, and spent the money. Well, I mean, I have to live! To tell you the truth, I think Ginger just fancies taking at a smackat me over that other thing. I mean, how many times do I have to tell you? She's trouble! But sure, nothing reallyhappened anyway like, you know? Just stay away from her altogether. I'll be all right. I'll wrangle me way out of it all right. Fucking pricks. So how's business? All right. Yeah? Do you miss me? Huh? Hey, we were a good team, mate,before that other little shit came along. Dermot's all right. What do you mean, he's all right? He's hard set to count to 10. He can count all right. Huh? We should break away on our own, anyway. Start up our own little outfit. We could pull off a bit of a job. Why not? I still have the balaclavas. All right, I know the last job didn't go so well for you and that. - Yeah, like 12 months. - Yeah. And I mean to say, thesethings happen, like you know? I mean, where else are we going to get it? I mean, it's not going tofall from the sky or anything, is it? [marching band playing] We are gathered here today to remember our deceased relatives, friends, and loved ones. And to honor them by ourpresence and our prayers. As I look around me heretoday-- at the beautiful graves surrounded by flowers and thewell kept resting places-- I can't but think how fortunatewe are to be living in a land where the dead are not forgotten, where the souls of the departed are not left to be abandoned to the abyss. We still believe-- thank God--in the forgiveness of faith, the forgiveness of sin, theresurrection of the dead, and the life of the worldly father-- Poor, old Kitty. God to be good to her, huh? You keep the grave lovelyanyway, John, fair play to you. The grave-- you keep it lovely, John. Well, it's the least I could do. She was a great wife and a very good mother. Is that all, right? Kathleen. This is me oldest girl now, John. What? Did you say a prayer for poor, old Kitty? Aye. Here's Betty. How are you Betty? - Hi, Betty. Hey, Betty. How are you, lads? I see the lads are here in force, anyway. Every year, boy, without fail. It's a wonder he's not over there with them. It's a great wonder to me he isn't then. I'm just nipping overto say a prayer for Dory. I'm going to tell you one thing, son, what, you fell on yourfeet the day you met her. - Do you reckon? - Yeah. I do. She's too good for him,[inaudible], ain't she, huh? She's not one bit too good for him. He comes from a very respectable family. And don't you forget it! I wouldn't her mad, boy. Fair play to you, maj. Hello. How are you? [music playing] [interposing voices] Hey, John. Yeah? Start with it. Who's that there? DERMOT: Huh? The fella talking to Gerry's daughter. Oh, that's, uh-- Patsy McDonagh. Patsy McDonagh. [water pouring] Kathleen! [inaudible], do you? What are you doing outhere with no shoes on you? Hey, you know me, a hardy snake! Yeah. Well, you won't be so hardywhen you get a big, dodgy piece of glass up you. Stop fussing, will you? What were you smiling at, anyway? When? Coming across the field. Oh, I was just thinkingabout a song I heard in the pub last night. What's the name of it? I don't know. Something with an angel or something. I can't think of it now. [alarm clock buzzing] [music playing] Eddie? [door opening] [clock ticking] CHILD: [inaudible]. [dogs barking] Right. See you later. Let's go. Yeah? This is it? Yeah. [engine revving] Kathleen! Kathleen! Could be a good match for Rosy, you know? That's not right, Gerry. She's too young and he's too old. I don't care what you say. [music playing] So what time? I need to know, if I'm making your dinner. Just have the dinner ready, right? I want to be back for that heap of shite you gave me for the breakfast. There's no point making it so, is there? The fucking dogs wouldn't eat it. Here's me father. We have to go. [dog barking] [MUSIC - THE FUREYS, "THE PRICKLY BUSH"] [SINGING WITH RADIO] Oh, the prickly bush. It feels my heart full of sore. And if ever I get away from that bush, I'll never get caught anymore. Her dad's the bare knuckle boxer, you know? - Yeah? - Yeah. He'd beat you for just looking at me. I wasn't looking at you. Hey Eddie, tell herabout yourself and Raymie. Himself and Raymie knocked off apost office one time, you know? They would have got away with it and that, only Eddie bought himself a new car, which looked kind of suspicious. What did they give you, Eddie? 12 months? They gave him a year because he wouldn't grass on another fella. But sure, as the cowboy said tothe horse, why the long face? What? Do you get it? Why the long face? Jeez, will you let me out of here, will you? [laughing] [crow cawing] [music playing] We pulled our little barreltank wagon right down that hill there-- right across here--let the horses off, and this is where we pitched our camp. Here we were. We were fine and snug here. Fresh water. And look-- rations of firewood for the fire. [inaudible] me little sister, Bridget. We were [inaudible] all together-- running here, through the woods. See those rocks? We should be climbing up those rocks. I started rambling into town, knocking around with the local boys. Old billiard halls and that. And my sister, Bridget, met a settle lad, and ran off, and got married--Dermot's mother and father. And that summer, the familythought it was time to move on, but I refused to go. Me dad was very disappointed, I think. Raging with himself, really, for dawdling too long at the watch spot. And he tried to persuade me to go along with him, but-- but-- but sure, my mind was made up. And they went off without me. And I never took to the road again. My wings were sort of clipped, I suppose. But you married a traveler? Aye. I married a traveler. Old Kitty. The Lord be good to her. I don't like the road myself. When I get married, I want to live in a house with a little orchardout the back, and a swing for the children, and all. People think that travelersdon't like beautiful things, but we do. And they think that wedon't feel the cold as well, but that's not true either. I love the feel of fresh water, the sound of it, and the wonder of it-- where it comes from, and where it's going to, and all. It's a fairly powerful thing, all right. [birds chirping] I, uh-- I-- I learned to swim in there, you know? It was a case of having to. I fell in there one day. And before I knew it, sure-- you know, well, I was sort of swimming. You're sure everyone loves beautiful things? I think I'll go for a bit of a swim, meself. What? Jesus, Kathleen! What? Keep an eye out, won't you? Tell me if anyone's coming. What? Go on with you! Jesus, Kathleen! I'd rather you wouldn't. DERMOT: Pull in here. Huh? I'll walk her across the field. That far? In case we wake the children. [music playing] What do you mean I was acting a Mary Magdalene? Stripping for that old man! You think he's going respect you after that? Do me a favor, will you? He does so respect me. And for your information,he's wanting to marry me. Yeah? And do you want to know why? Did you even ask yourself why? Well, I'll tell you why-- because you remind him of his wife, meauntie Kitty, that's why. So you needn't bother yourarse flattering yourself with all that, girl. [banging] Yeah. I'm me. Meself. No one else. And I won't be lumped withanyone else here and not by you, or him, or anyone. [hissing] Whoa! Take it easy. Take it easy now. There's no need for that. Now take it easy. What are you trying to do-- get the two of us killed or something?- Look, stop worrying, will you? Nothing happened. Nothing happened in an hour and a half? And nothing happened?- Yeah, well, it's done now. It's over. Forget it. Come on. Let's go. What do you mean, forget it? Forget it. Come on. Let's go! - Just a minute, pal. I've been waiting here for you for an hour and a fucking half, mate! An hour and a half! - So what? Do you want to do somethingabout it or something? Huh? Come on! Come on! Do something about it! Huh? Come on! I don't know. [engine revving] I only hope she was worth it. That's all I hope. [WHISPERING] What are you doing, Kathleen? [WHISPERING] Nothing. Go back to sleep. She's back, Ed. Tell her to go. You're better off without her altogether. She's no bloody good, that one. Such a night we had. And I have to comfort them with her here! [tv playing] How are you, Shirley? How are you? I'm off now, Eddie. I wanted to get home and get, Eddie, some of me late night bingo. Aye. Here's it. Here. Thanks, Eddie. Thanks. Look, if there's a problem, just say so. There's no problem. OK. I mean, I still have a stakein this house-- a big stake-- so if there's a problem-- There's no problem. SHIRLEY: Right. Go ahead upstairs, lads. Will yous? Good girls. So what happened? What do you mean, what happened? Nothing happened. I just need a place to stayfor a little while, that's all. I mean, if it's too much to askthat I can come home and stay in my own house, well-- Look, I told you before,you can come back anytime. I told you that. You know that. You-- you're still my wife and their mother. There's always room for you here. You know that. - Yeah? Yeah. I mean-- Yeah, well, I sort of heardsomething to the contrary, Eddie, like you know? Anyways, you don't worry about it. I won't be stopping too long. I'll stick me bags in the box room. Um-- What? Nothing. Just promised Jenny she couldhave her own room, that's all. It's all right though, man. And where's the clock? Now don't tell me-- the price was right, right? How long is she staying for? Don't know. A couple of weeks. Something like that. I told her, out straight,I'm not having it. I mean to stay the children areupset enough without all that. Well, maybe you have to put your foot down this time, Eddie. I mean, what are people going to think like? Her coming back whenever she feels like it. Anyway. Your mother and meself were drooling over these the other day. You should've seen her, Eddie. Imagine to do a holiday in the sun. What do you think? I don't know. Sure. I mean, I don't mind, meself,as long as there's sunshine. How much? Well, if we would book it now, we'd get it under 1,000 for the lot of us. And that's not bad. I mean, we'd be going at pig time, you know? 975. 1,000, more or less. But sure, I'd go halves with you. I know. I wouldn't expect that. You know I have me money save and all. We'd have a great time out there, sure-- the kids and your mother. I was half thinking of branching out on me own, like you know? 1,000 could go a long way. Well, at least think about it. Oh, yeah. I mean, I'll definitely think about it. [music playing] Dad wants a word with you? What? Get in. Take the lads up home for me, Betty, will you? Yeah. Right. Bye, daddy. You all right, lads? See you later on, eh? [door slamming] Ginger, give a minute. You didn't leave Dermot alonewith the girl at any time last night, did you? No. Did you, uh-- leave her to the door? No. We dropped her at the end of the field. What did you do that for? We didn't want to wake the children. Was that Dermot's idea? No. I don't think so. JOHN POWER: Hm? No. It was, uh-- what do you call it? I don't know. All our ideas like. All your ideas? TROJAN EDDIE: Yeah. More or less. - More or less? - Yeah. JOHN POWER: Well, which was it? Huh? I mean, was it more or less? Well, then how come she didn'tget home until half 11:00? Don't know. She must have went somewhere else. Oh. Where? Show me. Come on, Miley, dinner's ready. Ma wants you. [dogs barking] Patsy McDonagh? You whore monger! Stop him! Stop him, you fucking prick! I'll beat you good looking! Let go of me! [grunting] Jesus, Ginger! Ginger! Come on! For fuck's sake. Fuck off, you! A grown man could drawnin 3 or 4 inches of water. Would you? You can! What are you trying to do--kill the chap or something? Jesus, I mean, what did he do anyway? Your a turd, ain't you? Huh? You're a turd, aren't you? [coughing] You're a bloody bastard, ain't you? [groaning] Bring him here. Here. Take this now. And get out of here. Take the mail boat to London tonight. Don't ever come back hereagain or I'll kill you. Why London? I don't know no one over there. You ain't knowingnobody over there, do you? You're a bastard, you! You're going to get itfrom me one of these days, you know that? [music playing] [drunkenly humming] I think I made a big mistake, Eddie, getting involved with these people. We all make our own beds to lay in. Yeah, I know, but all the same. Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa. Every time I look atyou, I feel like shouting, man overboard! I'm all right. Huh? Nothing. What did you say, I said. I said I'm all right. See you're going down with the ship, boy. I feel like throwing yourlife jacket or something. You see that fist? Go on, take a look at that fist. Take a right look at that fist. Do you see those rings? Here. They're me father's rings. I broke a fella's jawwith that fist one night. Phoo! [grunting] And another night-- anothernight, I broke a fella's nose. Phoo! Right there. [WHISPERING] Did you-- did you ever hear the sound of a nose breaking? Yeah. It's a-- it's a sore sound, you know? You see that scar? Do you see it? Do you? One night, in the pubbrawl, a fella bit me there. He bored his teeth into me, like a wolf. And then he squeezed me by the balls. And he squeezed, and he squeezed, and he squeezed until he muted me. I won that fight. I won all those fights. I won every fight I ever fought! You know what I mean? Like ever! What? What? What? What? Nothing. Listen here, you-- fuck off, mate. What? I said, fuck off, mate. [screaming] [crashing] All right, Mr. Power. Take it easy now. Take it easy! That's what you alwayssay to me-- take it easy! What do you take me for? Take it easy! That's what he does-- he takes it easy! You want me to end up like him? Do you? He's a peasant, a buffer. He's a punk! But I'm a king. And a king needs a queen. You people, you haven't a clue! No idea! None! When my family-- my dadaand my mom-- came in-- Yeah. You have no idea! None, whatsoever! None! Get out of my fucking way. Come on, Ginger! Fuck off home, you. Sorry about that, Matt. Why did you bring themin here in the first place? For Christ's sake. Jesus Christ. [SINGING] I know, for sure, that I would-- fucking [inaudible]. That's right! I'm telling all yous, for fuck's sake! They're all buffers! They're all a crowd of fucking buffers!

A living grand. War. [phone ringing] Right, lads, the Great Southern Hotel. Let's go! Come on, boys! Come on! [dogs barking] Come on! Come on, will you? Hurry up then! Jesus, it gets cold! Come on! Hello, Dermot. It's Eddie. They know where you are, Dermot. They're coming to get you. I don't know. The war drums or something on you people. So you'd better get out of there fairly pronto. Oh, by the way, thanks for dropping me in it. There was nearly 11,000 inthat little suitcase, you know? Yeah, well, you might be glad to know that I've been getting thefucking evil eye ever since. I mean, what the fuck were you thinking of? I could have ended pushingup the [inaudible] here. You're going to have to givethat money back to them, you know? What do you mean, how come? I was responsible for that money! I mean, sooner or later,they're going to come calling, you know? And another thing, I neversaw you tonight either, right? I never saw you. [dial tone beeping] Ah, shit! The money's gone. Listen, the money-- the money's gone out! [slamming phone down] SHIRLEY: That wasn't exactlya marriage made in heaven, now was it? [gasping] It even makes you and me looklike the perfect pair, huh? Poor Eddie. What's poor about me? You just keep gettingleft behind all the time. I mean, there is that young lad-- he ended up with the money and the girl. Will he live to tell the tale though? That's the trouble with you, Eddie-- you want to live too young. I mean, you have to end upwith the money and the girl. Otherwise-- night. Night. [music playing] [gulls squawking] [giggling] [cheering] Come on! Come on! Look, he beat him before the last time. I know better. 3-1 is the odds. Take it or leave it. Come on! I sat five big ones onMarcy to give me 4-1 odds. I'll give you 3-1, if Gerry will take him three rounds or under. Right. You're on! You're on! [cheering] [inaudible]. [inaudible] [smashing into car] - Marcy! - Come on there! Marcy, get in there! Go on! Give it to him! [laughing] [cheering] Well, if you're going now, don't come back! I won't be here! Don't be here! I tell you, don't be here! Go back to your old flat, you fucking troll! You treat him better than you treat me! Get back in that housenow, like you're supposed to! I'm not going anywhere! Don't be around in my fucking head anymore! Don't come back! What are you fucking looking at? [dog barking] Will you do as you're supposed to be doing? [door slamming] He's a ballsy little bastard, I tell you, coming into me all like that. Yeah. He must be feeling lucky or something. Listen, I want to be straight with you. I want to see her again. Her voice at least. I don't care what she hasto say to me, you know? I mean, I don't really care, you know? Whatever. I'd like you to tell that,if you should see her again. And, uh-- you can tell her, also, that, uh-- I don't care what she's done, I'll take her back whenevershe wants to come back. I mean, I'm telling you this because I know that-- that you'll understand like. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah, he says. Your missus could be bangingright in front of you and you'll still take herback cause you're a sucker. I mean, I know-- I know we're all suckers when it comes to women, but you-- jeez, you'll take it to the extreme. Man, you're a fucking double decker. I mean, you should have heldon to that money, you know? I did. I mean, I just gave it to Kathleen. Oh, you gave it to Kathleen. You didn't give it to Dermot? Told you I never even saw Dermot. Just like you never lefthim alone with her that night. Just like he never walkedher across the field like. I suppose you thought thatthat was funny-- you and him. And you better pray, too, that that money is in tact when I find him. Otherwise, someone's goingto get hurt around here and it won't be me. Now fuck off with your yeah. And another thing-- don't gettoo close to that other fellow down there, if I was you, because he don't look too lucky to me. Aftershave for the man in your life, perfume from Paris for behindyour ear, an overnight case, just in case. We're going to need another bag, Raymie. Another grand would be more like it. A portable phone, so youcan give him a bell when you feel like checking up on him! Two pairs of bedroom slippers-- his and hers. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm definitely going toneed another bag, Raymie. A toolbox for the handyman. I thought you said you were handy? I am handy.I only live around the corner. [chuckle] I don't think I'm exactlycut out for this eternity lark, if that's what you mean. Is the money still intact? - More or less. - I'm all loaded up. Now, Eddie, come on.Let's go and get out of here. Yeah. All right. I'll be there in a minute. Listen, she's going to haveto go back sooner or later. You know that, don't you?- Yeah? Absolutely. When she does, you'll be left high and dry. And so will I, for siding with you. Now, I got something going on. You could take the money and come in with me. 50-50, down the middle. Course, you'd have to liefairly low for a while, but at least you'd be making a few bob while you're down there. What do you think? I don't know, Eddie. I mean, I don't think shewants to go back to him yet, you know? Then you'll have to bail out. Run out on her, you mean? I don't know about that. I mean, we didn't do it for the money, you know? What did you do it for? I don't know. Love and all that jazz, I suppose. Yeah. Well, dying for love isone thing, Dermot, living to tell the tale is another. Yeah. But sure, he's not going to let us just walk away with the money anyway. We'll tell him it's the price of love. I thought you wanted me to give it back to him. Yeah. Well, I changed me mind. [horn honking] I don't know. I'll have to think about it. We'll see. - Where will you be? - I don't know. I'll call you. [music playing] How much did you say she'dbe wanting for it again? Yeah. She'd be looking for 100 a week anyway, I'd say. Yeah? No. It's just that there's a fewdamp patches around the place like, you know? She wouldn't drop it down tothe 50 for the first year, would she? Just to give me a chance to get on my feet a bit. I'd say the lowest she'd gonow would be 75 like, you know? Yeah? But sure, I supposed you'd be looking for a place with windowsand everything, would you? Nah. No, not necessarily. Windows only distract thecustomers after like, you know? Aye? Oh, absolutely. How is she keeping anyway? Oh, she's well. Thanks. I'll ask her to drop downto the 50, if you like? Do you want me to? I do. All right. So I'll ask her, sure. It don't cost nothing to ask, do it? No. TROJAN EDDIE: [VOICEOVER]These watches are the best bargain you're ever likely to meet cause I give them away for nothing! One for the lady in red,one for the lady in purple, and one for the toothlesswonder down in the front there! That's the kind of thing that happens when Trojan Eddie comes to town! Jesus! [car honking] [inaudible] [thunder booming] Do you ever remember afellow called Bargain Joe, man? Yeah. Of course, I remember Bargain Joe. He used to have a stall inthe market one day a week. Bargain Joe-- yeah. He was a nice fella. Used to stand and watch that fella for hours on end when I was a little lad, you know? Fascinated me, he did. Jesus, he was a real jingler [inaudible]. He could sell you somethingyou didn't even want, you know? Yeah. I know. Flints, and lighters, andtin openers, and all that. I mean, he wouldn't do you now or nothing. He just managed to sell you something you didn't particularly need. That's all. And the banter he had-- fucking genius, boy. Do you know what his motto was? Always buy cheaper than you sell. Simple. Well, I'm sure of like him now, you know? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Trojan Eddie. And I come up with allthis spiel, too, you know? It just sort of spills out of me. Hello, missus, fancy a canary? Going cheap. [laughing] [phone ringing] Yeah? Eddie, it's Dermot. I'm out in the oldcaravan in Kleary's Cross, in case you're looking for me. For you. Hello, Dermot. Yeah? Well, what do you think? What-- what do you think I mean? Jesus. I mean, come on! Yeah. I'm going to bail out. Pick us up tonight at the cross, will you? Yeah, yeah. I'll have the money, don't worry. What do you think I'm going to do-- leave it here or something? Yeah. Right. 12:00 it is. Don't be late. So what do you got for me? What do you want? What do you got? I'm getting out. Yeah. Right. Oh, listen, we might haveto shift a bit of stuff early tomorrow morning. - Yeah. Right. [inaudible] [music playing] [phone dialing] Take whatever you want in there. [inaudible]. You want us to leave the old telly, do you? So you'll be coming back? Yeah. I'll be back in about 10 minutes. I don't know whether to takeall this stuff now or not. Well, it's what we came here for, ain't it? That's the trouble with you, Raymie, you never lose any sleep. I'm not going to lose anysleep over that little prick anyway, that's for sure. What, do you think he's goingto lose any sleep over you? Where is he though? That's what I'd like to know. Fuck him. Oh. Dermot! What happened? The McDonaghs came after us. - The McDonaghs? - Yeah. As if it wasn't bad enough with her people and the Powers looking for me. Now the McDonaghs want to get in on the act. I think I cracked a ribtrying to get away from them. Where's Kathleen? She's upstairs, having a wash. So where's the money? The money's gone, Eddie. What do you mean, it's gone? We had to leave it behind, sure. The McDonaghs probably have it by now. You're joking me, right? You're joking me! Shit! I don't believe it! You fucking idiot, you! Sure, what could I do? I mean, they werestorming in on top of us! I don't believe it! I do not believe it! I'm after getting a rake of stuff on the strength of-- course, youknow what I should have done? I should have-- oh, fuck! How did they know where to find us, is what I'd like to know. What? Shirley. What do you know? A fugitive of love, huh? What's wrong with you? Ah, go to bed, will you? Do you know, i think I will. After all, when a man leaves awoman with her legs in the air to go running back to hislittle missus, it's time to call it a day, I think, don't you? You're an even bigger idiotthan I thought you were. Mind you, one thing I will sayfor Dermot though is at least he'd never leave a womanwith her legs in the air, would you, Dermot? What are you on about? Jesus, your slow. Don't mind her, Eddie. Bitch! Come back her to tramp in and out like you own the place or something! Making a fool of me! Haven't even looked at the children! So what if I'm an unfit mother! Sue me. You're no great shakes yourself. I do me best at least! Ah, tell it to the judge. What did you say? You heard me. You try and come betweenme and those children and I swear to God-- All right, Eddie, keep your shirt on. I'm not even sure their bothyours, for Christ's sake. [grunting] Get off me! Jesus! [screaming] Jesus, Eddie, leave her alone, for God's sake! Get the fuck out of here, will you? Come on, Dermot. Jesus, Eddie, you know-- Get out of here! Fucking [inaudible]! Are you all right, daddy? Yeah. It's all right, lads. Everything's all right. [music playing] No! No! Please, don't! Piss off! Where's our money? What money? We didn't see any money, I swear! Where's our fucking money? I don't know what you're talking about! I thought I told you to get out of here. Yeah, I know, but I don'tknow no one over there. Nothing here, John. Just leave him alone, please. [gun firing] [horse neighing] Where did you say the money was? Maybe the townie has it? Trojan Eddie. Kathleen said Dermot was on thephone to him a couple of times. Trojan Eddie. [SINGING] Maids, when you're young, never wed an old man causehe's got no faloorum, he's lost his ding-doorum. Maids, when you're young,never wed an old man. He's got not faloorum, he lost his ding-doorum. Maids, when you're young,never wed an old man. So you think I snitched on him, is that it? Did you? What are you sidingwith him all the time for? He's no friend of yours. You could be on fire and he wouldn't even cross the road to piss on you. What did he give you, Raymie? 20 quid? 30? 40, huh? Let it rest, will you? Huh? You didn't hear me complaining when he was brought in instead of me. I let it rest. There was nearly 11,000grand in that little suitcase. Can you understand that? - Yeah. I think I can understand that. Well, understand this-- thanks to you, I'm back on the street again. So what, Eddie? You want me to lose some sleep over it, just like you lost sleep when you were trying to freeze me out? Freezing me out! Your best fucking friend for a fucking tinker! I did time for you! No! You got caught. You always got caught. I'm to blame because you got caught? Well, now you're caught again, Eddie. You have a room full of stuffand no money to pay for it, so what are you doing to do? Give it all back? Tell the man you're sorry? I mean, I know I done somequeer things in me time and all, Eddie, but there's things I didn't do in there, too, you know? What do you mean? Let it rest, will you? GINGER: How's it going? RAYMIE: How's it going? GINGER: Where's the other fella? RAYMIE: He's out. What's going on? Opposition, Ginger. Tell your dad his days are numbered. Yeah? He must have come in for a bitof money or something, did he? Yeah. Yeah. A bit of a windfall, Ginger, like, you know? A bit of a windfall, boy. You're a smirky, little bastard. Anybody ever tell you that? Yeah. I've a dirty kind of a smile, all right. But you're [inaudible]. Little prick. RAYMIE: Now who told you that? What? No. I'm only kidding you. [groaning] I want to talk to you. That swiped away the smirkoff your face, didn't it? Huh? Didn't it? I don't see you smiling now,you fucking little prick, you. Laughed at me. You laughed at me. I don't think so. [gasping] [music playing] [gasping] Jesus! Eddie! Eddie! Are you going to Dublin? Yeah. Get in the back. [grunting] Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! Look, I'm going! Sorry! I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! [police radios buzzing] Are you out for going into mourning or what? How do you mean? I haven't seen you aroundlike for-- for a few days. Look, if this is about that--well, that little shit bag, I wouldn't worry about it, if I were you. Sure, he was trying to pullthe wool over all our eyes. Did you know that he waswith the McDonaghs the night they went after Dermot. And for what? 30 pieces of silver, whichhe probably never even got. [train pummeling] Come on, lads! [inaudible]. What is it with you anyway? I mean, I took you off the streets when nobody else would even look at you. A fucking little jailbird, Jesus! I made money for you, mate. Like a lot money. You cost me a lot of money,too, I don't mind telling you. 11,000. Does that ring a bell-- 11,000? Don't know nothing about that. That's not what I heard. And in the mean time, you'redriving around in my van. Jesus, I must be going soft inthat bloody head or something! You want the van back? Here. Take it! Stick it! [laughing] Jesus! You know, we used to laugh at you. You made our lives worth living. What? And you think no one'slaughing at you or something? What did you say? Hm? What did you say? If I find out that you're mixedup in this, I swear to Jesus, I'll swing for you. Come back here, you little [inaudible]. I'm not finished with yet. You've got no right, turning your back and walking away from me like that! Because without me, you haven't got a chance! You haven't got a hope in hell! You see, I know who I am, and what I am, and how much I'm worth! But you-- you haven't got a clue. Not an idea! None, whatsoever. Sure, you'll come crawlingback on your belly, boy. You just wait and see! Trojan Eddie! Trojan fucking idiot! Pencils! 50 pence a dozen.
