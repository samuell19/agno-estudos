Talbot. - Here. O'Flair. - Here. Whenlon. - Here. Hartley. - Here. At ease. Men, the way you line up now is the way you line up each morning for roll call. The man at your side is the one who will be closest to you for the next 13 weeks. You will sit beside him in class, work beside him .. And dress beside him in the locker room. I'll give you two minutes to get acquainted. It looks like you're stuck with me, Mister .. O'Flair. - Mine is Whenlon. It looks like you are odd man. - Yeah. What do you say Whenlon, deal him in? - Sure. Let's pinpoint it: Chuck. Short for Chuck-a-lug. I am Russ Hartley. - My name is Harry. How are you. Attention! Lieutenant Redmond. Welcome to The Academy, gentlemen. Here we work together eight hours a day. Long hours, hard hours. The Academy is a constant challenge. Those of you who survive its course can be mighty proud. Just as we will be proud of you. The chief will now administer the oath. Please raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear you will support the constitution of The United States .. And the State of California? That you will faithfully discharge the duties of office of regular policemen. In and for the City of Los Angeles. According to the best of your ability. I do. In court. Testify only to what you actually saw. Hearsay by bystanders or the gossip of neighbors is irrelevant. Now "Code 2" is an urgent call. Get there in the minimum of time and with the utmost safety. Do not have your red light on and never use your siren. Sergeant, why can't we use the siren? That's a good question. When your sirens are blasting you can't hear yourself think. Now. Suppose you have a Code 2 all-unit call. Now if all cars have their sirens on and meet .. right here. You will have the doggonest crash in the history of the department. And frankly we can't afford to lose the vehicles. Men, meet Sergeant Culdane. His job is to toughen you up. And he knows his job. Jumbo, they are all yours. - Yes, sir. Well, I won't say I've seen better. I won't say I've seen worse. I've got a motto. "Too much stomach. Too little mind." So we'll whittle down the fat. I had a Sergeant like that in the army once. I lost ten pounds just listening to him. - We'll start easy. But I took care of him. - A nice little 2-mile run. I'll pace you .. let's go. Two miles. I already feel like I've run a hundred. - Stick with it, Russ. This pace is killing me. I got a hot phone-call to make. You'd better take it easy. I'm going to run Jumbo into the ground. He is pacing us. What's the matter, Sarge? Bunion trouble? Hey, you. You heard me say I am pacing this deal. - Right. But I forgot to tell you. I am in a hurry. On your feet, mister. Now listen, jet-head, you were ordered to follow me. Just a moment, Sergeant. I don't think you are being quite fair to Mr O'Flair. Mr O'Flair is an exceptionally fast man. A credit to his class. Mr O'Flair, I didn't get to see your performance. I feel that I have missed something. Would you be good enough to do that run again? Is that an order, sir? That's an order. And not so fast. We are going to do it correctly this time. Get on your mark. Men. Observe Mr O'Flair carefully. Notice the perfect back contour. Observe the rippling coordination of his leg muscles. No, I am not through yet. Get on your mark. Look at his ears, all perked up and ready for the gunshot. Notice that right foot. His toe barely touches the ground. - Lieutenant. Yes, Mr Whenlon? Well sir, you see I sort-of challenged O'Flair. I said I'd race him home. So he put on speed. I see. Then I suggest you and Mr O'Flair try again. Get on your marks. Sucker. That is me. Alright. Go! Face it honey, you've been dying for me to ask you all week. I am ready now. How about tonight? Gentlemen, I just broke the locker-room case. I arrested 400 towels and booked them into the laundry. Yak, yak, yak. What is with happy here? Oh, honey .. Wear your hair up tonight so it will be easier for me to get into it. Don't you ever wind down? - Nah. I was telling Mary about you guys. Mary? Relax. Mary is my wife. She felt maybe you'd like to come over tomorrow for a barbecue at our place. What do you say? - Thanks, Russ. I'll be there. Make it a threesome and tell Mary I like my barbecue rare and hot. Greetings. - Welcome to the Hartley mansion. Mary, meet Chuck and Harry. Grown by myself in my own window-box. They are lovely. - I hope you like it. Harry, that is sweet of you. Put these in a vase darling, will you. And put the monster to bed. I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to. Now, Mike. Mike, you heard your dad. Got to be bed now. You are beautiful, aunt Jane. Come on, boy. Jane, dear. Mr O'Flair, Mr Whenlon, this is my sister Jane. Hello. Let's get to the point. Married or single? Single. - Well .. The night, the girl, the perfume in the air. Inhale. Hmm. I always did like the smell of hamburger. Am I going to have trouble with you? Not unless you bring it on yourself. I am going to have trouble with you. It looks like I'll have to have to give you a ticket for speeding, Mr O'Flair. Chuck. Short for Chuck-a-lug. And the little monster is right, aunt Jane. You are beautiful. And that is an expert opinion. - Expert at what? Now, how can you give me a ticket for speeding unless I speed? You were born speeding. The hamburgers are coming on. To be continued. Are the kind of a girl that wants a girl to say "I love you" all the time? Well, that washes Howard. Too bad, A nice kid. - What about Whenlon? Willing, cooperative. Better than most in class. A solid, steady good man. We carry him. O'Flair? Read his package, Kane. I'd like to check it with mine. O'Flair. Charles. Civil Service test: 88 percent. Physical: excellent. Temperament: Quick thinking, egocentric and over sensitive. Apt to resent conformity. In other words, a wise guy. Too rich for my blood. I'd say wash. - I'd say keep. He needs a bit of squeezing but he's got spirit. I'd like to take him over myself for a couple of weeks. Well, Lieutenant? He is your baby, Jumbo. Give him the business. It will be a pleasure. Always be on the alert. Hartley. Suppose you are shaking hands. You never watch a man's hands. Always watch his eyes. Alright, O'Flair. O'Flair, come on. Do you mind if we try that again? - Any time. You're pretty good. But before we are through I'm going to throw you. If you do, you'll be the oldest man to ever leave the academy. Step back. Ready on the firing line. He won that in '29. The International Police pistol shoot. Our team beat just about every police department in the world. This guy didn't need a gun. He had a face that scared them to death. He was a member of the '29 team. He was on his way home from work one night. There was a stick-up and he stopped it. He took a .38 slug between the eyes. You talk like he was your dear old Dad or something. He was. Somebody ought to bust me right in my big mouth. My pleasure. Much obliged. - Don't mention it. Congratulations. O'Flair. Congratulations. - Thank you, sir. Whenlon. Congratulations. - Thank you, sir. Harley. Congratulations. - Thank you, sir. Men. You are now regular police officers of the City of Los Angeles. You will report to Central Station at 8 o'clock to receive your assignments. And .. I will see you all at the graduation dance tonight. Dismissed. No more routine. Now we'll see some action. Hey, we're heading for the biggest steaks in town tonight and I am buying. Hey, wait a minute. Hold everything. The dance. Hiya, aunt Jane. Chuck-a-lug. We're dancing tonight. I'll be down to get you in a taxi, honey. Be ready by about half past eight. Wear that white shimmer dress. The one with the wicked neckline. Come again? I said Harry is taking me. He asked me a week ago and I accepted. Oh, you poor, poor girl. Congratulations. - Why? Ha. Don't give me those big, sad eyes. You are taking Jane to the dance. - Me? Watch out for this lad. He is not as tame as he looks. Excuse me. Hello? Hello. Miss Anderson? I .. I .. Of course you didn't ask me Harry, but you were going to, weren't you? I'll be delighted. Be down to get me in a taxi, honey. I'll be ready about half past eight. What? See you tonight. Goodbye, Harry. Goodbye. Jane. You could hold me a little closer, Harry. I won't break. Honest, I won't. I've never danced much. - There is nothing to it. Just relax. Deep breaths. And hold me a little closer. Mind if I cut in, buddy? What's the matter, Whenlon? Lost your girl? Not exactly, Sergeant. O'Flair is dancing with her. He has been doing that all night. You know, that Whenlon is a nice lad. What do you say we give him a break? I am for it. Admit it to yourself, honey. Dancing with me really lifts you. Mr O'Flair, when did you first realize you were in love with yourself? Ah! Now you are mad. That's good. I am not. No? That is too bad. Because if you were mad we could kiss and make up. Really, Mr O'Flair, I am not mad. It is just that you give me a dull headache. Ha. Excuse me. By the time I put in a call for a man it would be too late. What about one of the new men. I would hate to take any of them out of here on a night like this. It is a dangerous assignment. It'll be a good break for any man you take. Make detective in a month. I didn't mean to eavesdrop Sarge, but if you are looking for a good man .. You know a funny thing, Lieutenant. I was just thinking of O'Flair. Isn't that a coincidence. Got your gun on you? Okay. Let's go. Hey Sarge, we're pretty far out aren't we? About five more miles to go. You haven't told me anything about this deal. What are we supposed to do? You'll find out when we get there. You just do this job right .. And you'll be carrying your badge in your wallet instead of on your chest. How am I doing, Jane? Wonderfully. You're learning. If you hold me any closer you'll be behind me. Alright. This is it. You got your gun? Okay. Now I want you get out and case this house. Just a minute. Synchronise watches. O'Flair. Check the window first. And be careful. So long, detective. Keep in touch. Height? Five seven. Weight? - 170. 371, Sarge. The same number as yesterday and the day before that and the day before that. Towels next. Towels, blankets. Blankets, towels. I feel like a chambermaid. Height? Weight? Where were you born? What mailing address? They ask the same questions a million times every day. No more routine. Plenty of action. Get a load of that. How about that uniform? Strictly catnip for the kittens. You know the book, Harry. How much more money a month do they make than we do? Plenty. Mary and I could sure use it. - And the way that uniform sings. The three of us would be in the same division. We get to see each other more than once a month. What's the matter? You boys want a thousand motorists to hate you? I'll take a little hating for a job like that. So would I for the extra money. I was on that squad for ten years. Every time you ride your bike you throw a pair of dice with your number on them. I've got a silver plate in my head to prove it. I'll be seeing you. Who do we have to see about that motor-squad deal? If there is an opening it will be posted on your division bulletin board. "Traffic Enforcement Division." "Quota filled." By the time there's openings on the motor squad .. They'll call it the "Flying saucer patrol". Yeah. They'll pay the extra money in stardust. Hey, come on! Get the lead out. It's on the board. What is your purpose in wanting to join the motor squad? I'd like the pay raise, sir. And I like the feel of a cycle under me and .. I like the uniform. What does your wife think about you joining the motor squad? I haven't told her yet. I suggest you do. That will be all. Report tomorrow morning at the Field Riding School. Seven sharp. Wear Levi's, sweatshirts, gloves and boots. That's all. Perfect timing. It's going to take 15 minutes. Oh, Harry. You haven't told Jane about us trying out for the squad, have you? No. About all I've had time to do is say: "Hello. You're beautiful" and "Goodbye". Well don't tell her. Not yet. She might tell Mary. And you haven't told her? - Uhuh. She thinks I'm safe and cosy in the supply room. I don't want her to worry. Besides, I might not make the grade. Thanks. Russ. Yes, honey? Its quarter to five. Why are you up so early? Why aren't you in uniform? They've got a physical training detail for the fellows who work on the inside. They want us to keep in shape. Come here. You're in shape. I'm coming to see you tonight. You certainly will. The throttles on your motors are taped. We take it easy around here for a while. Now go to your motors. I wonder how fast this heap will go. Isn't it about time you grew up? Quite a motor-boy, aren't you. I was born in a crib with wheels on it. One more stunt like this and you'll be back in a crib without wheels on it. Let's go back. Alright, fellows. Watch the way he lays this motor down. Hi, Jumbo. What goes? Kind of a busman's holiday. What did you draw this time? About the same. A couple of stray lambs and one real cowboy. You know, that Hartley is a good boy. He might be a little timid on the bike but he is a good boy. But that other one? - O'Flair? There is a real throttle-snapper. He bought it. Do you mind if I have the pleasure of his company? He is all yours. O'Flair. Come here. Hi Jumbo. What's up? You and I are going to take a little ride in the country together. Aren't you little old for that sort of thing? Just try to keep within five feet of me. You'll feel my breath down the back of your neck. Hey. What you doing down there? The trail is up here. The bridge was washed out. What's the matter, you afraid of it? No. Yes. Yes, I am afraid of it. Well, the machine has got a lot of power. But you've got something that machine doesn't have. That something makes you boss. What's that? Your brain. Alright. Now come on, let's go. And remember, you are the boss. Keep it nice and steady there. Just relax a little. Easy, easy. Yeah. Attaboy. Good work, boy. Okay. Now you are on your own. Well. You got yourself a motor-boy. Hi, Russ. Seen Janey? She went to the movies with Harry. - Oh, the poor, poor, girl. You look beat. What's up? Can't you take the bouncing? Mary, why don't you get Chuck a bottle of beer? Thirsty, aren't you? - Yeah. I could use one. You should have seen yourself when you landed in those bushes. Go on, honey. Get him the beer. What's the matter? Pipe down, Chuckle-head. She doesn't know about the squad yet. Why not? I just haven't had the chance to tell her, so forget it. Well, you should have seen yourself. What were you boys talking about? Well .. Your boy is weak in callisthenics. Especially knee-bends. And I am here to give him aid and comfort. On your feet. Twenty knee-bends. Come on. Down boy. One. Two. Three. That's the way. That's the way. Now let's see how good you are at track. O'Flair and Hoyt. 29D. Concentration point. Sunset and Alvarado. Whenlon and Hartley. 17D. Concentration point Wilshire and La Brea. You'll have to tell her now. So this is why you left every morning at daybreak. Sorry honey, I meant to tell you. I just didn't get a chance. You had a good safe job but no, you wanted this. Look, this means extra money for us. Plenty of extra money. I talked it over with the boys. It's .. - The boys? You mean Chuck, don't you? If he jumped off the City Hall tower, you'd follow him. I didn't join up to nurse towels and blankets in a supply station. If I use my head on this machine I am as safe as I anywhere. - Safe? What are you talking about, Russ? - Look, will you stop worrying. I'm sorry, but I love you so and I worry about you. I know. I'm a citizen that loves the law. My name. Also, my address. Also, your ticket. Quite a guy, huh? Pass the pickles. You know, I like this place. - It is beautiful. My dad and I used to come here. He'd tell me how a million years ago this river was part of a big ocean. Weren't we all? Are you cold? A little. - I'll get your wrap. You might try putting your arm around me, Harry. You know something. Yes. I know something. When are you through, Chuck? - Nine on the nose. Janey and I are .. - Yeah, I know. You're off duty and you're taking her to the movies. Happy popcorn. Chuck. A truck ran a stop sign, and going fast. How often have I told you to have the mechanic check the carburettor? For your benefit. So don't just sit there. Get him for me. And lose half an hour with Janey? The things I do for you. You went through a stop sign down the street. Let's see your license. - Sorry, officer. We got a schedule to make. I caught you doing better than fifty-five. What are you hauling? - Furniture. Did you say furniture? What's it made of, bleeding redwood? Open it up. I said open it up. You think he'll remember us when he comes to? Too late to think about that now. Get your licence. Let's get out of here. Move over. I'll drive. Hey, what are you doing? You crazy? There is a car coming. He only had time for the beginning of the license. 2-3-0. Now just try to be correct, mister. It was a big red truck. - And I still say it was brown. Alright. Thanks very much. It should have been me. [ Doorbell ] I want to see Jane. - Why don't you leave her alone? Please Mary, I have got to see her. Hello, Chuck. I'll only take a minute, Jane. I must tell you the truth myself so you'll know it's the truth. Please, Chuck. - I killed him. No you didn't. - Just as if I'd shot him in cold blood. Do you think saying that helps her any? What will you do now? - Leave the force. I just don't belong. Stop blaming yourself, Chuck. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. That is what you are doing, you know. Now goodbye, Chuck. Please, goodbye. I want a roving assignment, sir. I want to get that truck. That is Homicide's job. - It is my job. We are short-handed, O'Flair. How much time do you want? - A month, sir. I'll give you ten days. That's all. You know the city limits. Your time is your own. You have permission to wear plain clothes if the situation calls for it. And if needed, you can disguise your motor. Report for reassignment in ten days. - Yes, sir. Oh. I gave Russ Hartley the same permission. Good luck. - Thank you, sir. Licenses. A million of them. So far they are all clean. - Keep going. That is a pretty clear print. I'd say three quarter inch tread. It could be used on trucks from six to ten tons. Notice anything special? Look closely. See that mark there? That was made by a sharp stone or a broken bottle. The chance is a thousand to one against any other tire having the same mark. When you find the truck with that tire on it, that's your baby. Can you give us a duplicate? - Sure. Come back in an hour. Where did you put the cleaning fluid? Oh, I used the last of it yesterday. Then go to the store and get some. Yes, master. I can't give Jane Harry's jacket with this stain on it. That's a blood stain. Harry bled internally. We applied the biological precipitant test. It is not human blood. As a matter of fact the analysis definitely showed it to be bovine blood. So? So you are looking for a cattle truck. Better call it a night, Chuck. - Not yet. Regulations say no riding in the rain. But it is not raining now. The streets are wet. I'm alright. Get him. Keep your hands in plain sight and step down. What are you trying to do, copper? - I said step down. Wait a minute, copper. We got to make the airport in six minutes. This is very important to the army. You heard our siren. Why didn't you stop? We were expecting an escort and we thought you guys were it. How about it copper, do we make the plane or don't we? Go ahead. Now I am in for it. Yeah. That is a mess isn't it. What were you trying to do, kill yourselves? You knew you were breaking regulations, Hartley. Yes, sir. I am going to recommend that you be suspended for ten days without pay. And I will see that you are charged with the cost of the repairs to your motor. That will be all. Yes, sir. Well, O'Flair. Aren't you going to say something? No, sir. - Well, that is strange. You generally do all the talking. But this time I am going to do it. We've carried a book on you ever since you started at the academy. You are quite the genius, aren't you, O'Flair. No, sir. - Yes you are. Regulations weren't meant to be respected by geniuses. I am going to relieve you from duty immediately. And I am going to recommend to the chief that you be suspended. You will be notified when to appear before the board of rights. Turn your motor in to the foreman in the garage. That's all. Yes, sir. You're wrong, Captain. Cut it out, Jumbo. It is my squad and my responsibility. Now look, let's drop the rank for a minute, Bill. And remember a rainy night in '39. Ah, we were both a couple of squirts then. It was just luck we both weren't killed or both thrown off the force. Quite a night we had, wasn't it. I've got work to do. Get out of here, Jumbo. I will as soon as you pick up that phone and take O'Flair out of cold storage. I'd kind-of keep an eye on him. He reminds me of me. Why can't I ever say no to you? That's what my wife always asks. Get me the garage. You know. Why don't you lift Hartley's suspension while you are at it? How are we stacked? Where is the dough? I got ten juicy ones lined up at the south end. Get them out fast. My boss is due back. - Okay, come on. Let's go. Turn down here. We'll go in the back road. Right over there. Come on. Hurry it up! Play the game. Oh, you poor soul. Gin. You and your hunches. You are just too lucky. What makes a good cop? On third muscle, two thirds luck. Sheriff's sub-station 21. Speaking, Mr Donford. We'll get to it immediately. We're undermanned, Mr Donford. Be out there right away. Donford has been rustled again. Cattle rustling in Los Angeles? Ten head at $275 each on the hoof. It sounds like the good old days. Hand me down my six-gun, partner. The good old days were penny-ante. With the price of steak this is hot action today, Jumbo. Do you mind holding the fort until Linkwood gets back? He is on patrol. You got it. This is Chatsworth 191. Get me Communications, Los Angeles Police Department please. Communications? Sergeant Culdane. Contact 349 for me and have him call Chatsworth 191. Yeah. Give it a Code 2, will you. Right. 349M phone Chatsworth 191. Code 2. [ Telephone ] Hello? O'Flair? Culdane. It might be a good idea to cruise 101. Concentration point: Livo Canyon. It's a mile north of Chatsworth. It is just a hunch. But it is about time we had a little luck. Okay. Goodbye. What's the idea, fellah? You ain't no law. Any trucks pass you on this stretch? - Nope. Nobody passed me. Thanks. Motorbike tailing us. - A copper? No. It looks like a speed-boy. If he's a speed-boy, why doesn't he pass us? Slow down. See what happens. I said slow down. Slow down on that shellac too. He's gone. - You're jumpy. Settle down. Ever since you bumped that cop .. - Ever since we bumped that cop. It's him again. We're coming to a dirt road. Turn in. If he follows us we'll know the score. And suppose he does? Satisfied? Put her in gear. Let's go. Hear something? - No and neither do you. Give me that. This is 349M. I'm at the hideout of a 549. Send me some help. Livo Canyon. North end. Off 101. 349M. Roger. Attention all units. Officer needs help at the north end of Livo Canyon off 101. "Attention all units." "Officer needs help at the north end of Livo Canyon. 101." "687 handle the call. Code 3." "All other units. Code 2." How is it going, Mack? - Got ten big ones for you. Let's have a look at them. Quicklime. What a bath. "Attention all units." "Attention all units." "At Manchester and Maine. There is a 1205." Okay, mister. What about it? This is the guy that was tailing us. I said, what about it. - What about what? I lost my way and .. Thought I'd find somebody in here who could straighten me out. Where you heading for? - L.A. I've been down to Newhall doing a little road-racing. I guess I forgot the shortcut they told me about. I suggest you forget you've ever been here. Consider it forgotten. Just tell me my way home and I'll shove off. Livo Canyon. Turn to your left. Hey, that motorcycle over there. It's giving out police calls. That guy is a cop. Back up. Back up! Joe. Take off your white coats. They make good targets. Go and get your guns. Cover the other doors. Hey, Mike. Stay there. I'll take care of him. Leave him to me. Come on. Get to those spotlights. Flash them around among the brush. Cover the whole area. Did you get him? I don't know. He'll either flush out or roast. Now don't get any silly ideas about leaving, Chuck. The doctor said six weeks at least. With time off for good behaviour I'll do it standing on my head. Why not? It's the way you do everything else. Anything I can send you while you're here? What he wants you can't send him. Time is up. You will have to go now. And you try to sleep, young man. Will you visit me again, Jane? - Sure, Chuck. As often as they'll let me. I'll be back to see you tomorrow. By the way, congratulations. You finally made the force. So long, Officer O'Flair. Hello, Mr 0'Flair. This is no time to take my temperature. Say "ah", Mr O'Flair. Ah .. -(-sd-)-
