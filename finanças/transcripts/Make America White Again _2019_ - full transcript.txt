Mister Bandari Sorry, do I know you? My name is Winnie McKellar, I'm here to interview you Yeah of course, good to meet you The pleasure is mine. I didn't realize it was an in-person interview I was expecting a phone call Well my office is just a few blocks away I find these things are always better in person I hope you don't mind. No not at all um I'm Trying to make my flight Would you mind doing the interview in my car That would be great Mister Bandari. Please Thank you so much for doing this interview I've heard quite a lot about you Anything interesting There's a lot about your company And its rapid rise into the upper echelon of the tech Industry So there's nothing interesting right Well I also noticed that your name appears at the top of nearly every charity organizations list of contributors I believe in giving back, after all much has been given to me You do a lot for people in need This is the angle I want to take with this article What do you mean? Most of what is written about you is about Mr Bandari The successful businessman entrepreneur This information is good, but I believe that people are more interesting than just their job titles Who is Avinash as a human being. What's his story What series of events shaped him into who he is today Well for starters it's Nash for short Nash I'm basically from India, where I studied Computer Engineering I typically fit the stereotype Of Indians being prolific at computer programming yes Well my story actually started in the United States Great I moved here after being offered job in a software company and I didn't know anyone when I first came, as I was the first one from my family to go into the US but eventually you made friends I hope Yes I did, in fact they're still my best friends tell me about them. How did you guys meet There's Zorik, the Russian hacker Is that another stereotype Ok … what do you want? Superman red sun signed by Mark Miller Ha Ha Ha No No way I stood in line for hours to get signed I know Zorik you we both did you were right in front of me and when it was my turn the signing was over and book store closed But it's Redsun Yaaa You don't want anything else? Noooo Is it still in mint condition So nice Super man Redsun. The Sickest shit ever Ok. Lets not rub it in I am sorry Bogdon… Bring the duffel bag. So, tell me. What you are going to do with all this money? I'm going to America. After exchanging the Bitcoins for cash Zorik made it to the US Mexico border There he met the other two immigrants Cameron from Nigeria and Dan Dan from China The stars must have been aligned because as a strange twist in their fate they all realized that they had a similar skill which is computer engineering And then they made it into the US together Then there's Billy, he knows how to handle everything but actually not knowing anything about it at all And where is Billy from He's from Austin Next question... F*** Working at the office was a strange experience for a person like me I'm pretty sure I saw all of my co-workers on TV at the Charlottesville protest They were the one that wanted to keep the monuments They were white supremacists Language Library language expressions She's been gone for a while; you think she's coming back anytime soon Whatever So, what are you, like fresh out of the school I've worked for this company for 2 years Oh cool are they promoting you today I'm actually being fired What do you mean?

I need the check list. We have a task in an hour. Showcase Showcase on day one? Are you crazy? I'm nucking futs That's a 2-week task. You just came on board. I'm that good Look, Ms. Davenport liked the codes that I wrote up, so she asked me to get the checklist from you and I need it Can I have it in an hour? Please? Hey, can I get a checklist popped up? Thanks After many hours of development and rigorous UAT testing We have released into production our version 1.0 of the F.R.T.S software this surveillance software has facial recognition capabilities and automatically tracks any chosen subject continuously between different cameras In our home land sorry let's focus... I'm sorry Let's focus the importance of this technology Hospitals, office buildings, large buildings Security will Skyrocket and efficiency can you explain the technology behind the scenes Question is How... is.. it.. created? This is garam masala smells wonderful How is it created? The technology behind the back box Cardamom and coriander colander just tickled my throat for lunch I had that for lunch earlier it.. Say data mining and data science data mining data science Google tensorflow tensor tensor flow open face and Java web. W-E-B services you know this is all technology and stuff, for a lot of people it's really hard to understand. I am sorry could you refresh us a little more on the functionality of the software. Functionality yep. Nash Nash Nash Nash Nash Basically, what happens is, all this tracking occurs because we have all these servers that are attached to the cameras. So really, it's the cameras that send in the videos to the central servers Where, you know, that's where all the tracking happens. Is that..? Does that make sense? Yeah good good good Should have seen Dave's face that sack of s*** Dave never liked me. He used to harass me with Indian jokes I don't I've even heard an Indian joke. So, how do you blow up an Indian? I don't know, how? You press the red dot on his face. Hahaha that's terrible What do you call Indian dating app? I don't know, what? Connect the Dots. That's pretty good. Oh wait, hold on a second guys, email from Miss Davenport Hit it boss. Oh, insert salami in punani. Uhhh... Mandatory meeting in 15 minutes. Ok I got to run. Be available. Thanks First, let's take a moment to congratulate Natalie on an impressive release today. Applause Not only did she deliver a superb product, but she brought it in 3 weeks ahead of schedule. Although, I should say we owe much of today success to our new team lead, Mr. Billy Ryan. Thank you. Thanks. Mr. Ryan it's your first day here today... You didn't overwork yourself did you? Oh no. Nope, not at all, just getting started. Mr. Ryan you have a rare gift. Hadouken Let's hear it for Billy Ryan: Software Superman. Okay folks, let's get to the heart of the matter. I'm looking for a team to work on a special project, it's urgent. An Olympic software team would take 8 months to do it. We need to do it in less time. How much less? 4 months. So, what's the project? Analyzing biological data using Java. We can do it in 3 months. We can do it in 2 months. One month. That's stupid! No, he can't. Never mind Dave. I can do it. Now, that's b***S***. You're a fake. Dave, you and Holly can stop riding my coattails, okay. Go form your own band. You may be software Superman, but you still need a team. Look, I know a group of really talented guys. Literally software geniuses I bring them on, we can pull this off. Yeah, yeah. What is it software Spider-Man, Iron man, and Batman? Me me me me It's an 8 month project. You want to promise it to me? In 1 month? 2 or 3 would have been good, but that was already taken. But yeah. We can do it. One month. Say it I can do one month one month What have I done? Come on! You're leading the resistance. More power to you. Yeah, that's just the saying. I wanted to lead a software team I have no idea what that meant till today Well obviously, you leveraged your position. To an effect, I mean it worked right? Listen, you are bringing the mice in to the cheese factory. I can't bring the mice into the cheese factory. That's the problem. This last meeting might as well have been a clan meeting with the grand wizard himself. Except this guy is kind of likable in a weird way. Well then why did you speak up? Because I'm impulsive. I don't know, I didn't think it through. I just I just need that Nash and the guys could do a better job then anybody. Yeah. Yeah, it does sound like you're in a little bit of a dilemma. I mean what are you going to do next. Can I try one of those fuzzy navel shots? How about tequila? And this one's on me. I'll take a free tequila shot. Always take a free tequila shot. Any day of the week. Cheers. Cheers. Billy isn't book smart, but I would be lying if I said he wasn't pure genius. He saw close resemblance of me with Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson? Yeah, let me show you. Wow! Look at that, the King of Pop. You're a doppelgänger. This close resemblance brought in a radical idea in to Billy's brain. What is it Billy? Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Michael Jackson? Yeah you kind of do. Hey Michael Jackson was black. Was he? That doesn't matter the man transcended color. Well I dressed up like Michael Jackson once for Halloween. What you guys have Halloween in India? Now it's getting popular. Well the point is, Ms. Davenport is not going to hire an Avinash or a Dan Dan. But she will hire a Mike and a Dan. What about me and Cameron? Well Zorik you can be Zachary. And Cameron... You can keep your name. Cameron is fine. That's fine Have you looked at me and Nash? What about our color? Bingo, that's where you come in. You guys ever hear of white face before? You can't be serious. What is whiteface? White face, you know, When people of color paint themselves to look white. Nick Cannon did it. Really? Yeah! There's no way painting ourselves white will work. Of course it'll work. Cameron, you said you can make me look like Barack Obama right? Can't you make yourself look Caucasian? Sure it will take hours at a time, and then you have to maintain it through out the day. But it's possible, Right? Sure it's possible. I can make us look like whatever we want, but I cannot change our accents Well I can help with that that's fine I'll tutor you. Well, that's a long shot. It's the only shot. Otherwise I lose my job and you guys go home. Yeah Yeah I'm already White I just sound scary when I speak. I'm okay too. Cameron? Okay boss. We know that in order to pass as a normal white guy we needed to have clear American accents. And I thought YouTube tutorials would be of some help 0 -0 -0 -0 Guys what's going on in here? It looks like a weird black magic voodoo party. It's white magic we are practicing. Yes which I just amazed at the great American culture. Okay, alright yeah, that's great. We can do that later. Right now, you need to fix your makeup you guys look like the product of an orgy between Ronald McDonald, Prince. And an alpaca. What the hell is orgy? Cameron, can you help with the makeup stuff? Okay we'll do this stuff later. Okay guys. Big .. big... Black... Black bear bear has has big big blue blue balls balls big black big black bear bear blue balls - frustration in Hindi That's fine. That's okay. Take five. You'll get it you'll get it. Big black bear blue got big blue balls. I got it. Yeah. I got it. Now sing it. The big black bear's got big blue balls and the big black bears little big blue lo haha. What about the f word? Always a bad idea? No, not necessarily. Explain Okay, well it could be used in a good way. Like, uh... this Alfredo is F****** amazing or, it's nice to f****** meet you. Or let's get f***** up. Dan Dan, tell me I'm a fat piece of s*** who's going to die of heart failure. You're a fat piece of s*** and you're going to die of heart failure. Okay, now ask me if I give a f***. You give a f***? No, see by me saying "Ask me if I give a f***" It means I really don't care. How that works? That's a good one. Cameron, your head's on fire. Ask me if I give a f***. Perfect Now, take everything that I've taught you, improvise, add to it, etc. Evening gentlemen, will you have room dessert? Or possibly anything else to drink? Uhhhh I'm good. Do you guys need anything? Yes, I would like a f****** Chardonnay. Excuse me. Please, and thank you. How did I do? Interesting, at least you smiled. Do you know where the restrooms are? No I don't. Oh, ask the maitre d. Excuse me Sir, Do you know where the restrooms are? Absolutely. They're on the opposite side of the restaurant... F*** Yeah tell me about it. I 've been on my feet all day. So gentlemen, how was everything? Dan Dan do you want to handle this? Exquisite. I see you ordered the chicken marsala. How was it? I totally f***** it up. Wonderful, if you need anything at all please do not hesitate to ask us. Your Chardonnay. Unfortunately gentleman, my shift has ended, but it's been a pleasure serving you guys this evening. I'm going to leave the check right here, but no rush and take your time. Thank you Have a good night. Alright, appreciate it. F*** off buddy What? That's not what he meant. He meant f*** buddy? What? That's not what he meant either You trying to get with me punk? No, it's a misunderstanding. Oh I understand perfectly fine s*****. That's not creative homeboy. Home-home-It's about... Ohh f*** Are you sure we're supposed to be out here right now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely, this is the best way to find out if it's going to work. Okay, so the best way to interact is, don't interact. That make sense? No. What do we do? Act natural. Smile, wave Like, smile at The Stranger. Absolutely Hi white person! Don't say white person. Hello. She actually smiled back. See how it works? Americans first. For peeing? You guys there. Yes, you both. Come here. Come now quickly. Now pardon our intrusion, but what are y'alls names? Zachary... Dan We... We are cousins. No You two are some of the whitest people we have ever seen. Thank you. We need more people like you representing the states. Zachary, you and your Mongoloid cousin clearly agree that us, true Americans are the dominant race. Toast to that. Are you two show us how much you hate immigrants? Yeah hey Black is whack.. quite so indeed. Asian lives don't matter. No they don't. A toast! To our race. The best that god has ever been. White power? White power. So, you said you're from Montana? Yes. Your facial features strike me as a little Mongoloid-ish? My father f***** an immigrant. Awesome. You are in. Billy says you're the best at acquiring software tools. Yes, oil from the middle east. Land from the natives and now, software from the Chinese. Nothing a white man can't acquire with high broadband speed. Wow, you might be good at software, but look at that piece of hardware. Well, it if isn't the King of Pop. Just remember that in this office, I'm the queen. Period. Okay, well, it looks like we're all fine and dandy. This is just a brief formality, we have a lot of work on our hands. Review meeting in 15 minutes. This is the facial reading camera. Or, FRC for short. It's used for facial motion capture. Just like they use in CGI in Hollywood. Except this isn't Hollywood. This is government. Your facial muscles and how they respond to any particular stimuli tells quite a lot about who you are. It's meant to be used in conjunction with this machine here. The NVM or the natural vibrations meter. The subject will place his hand on the glass. The glass will then read the vibrations through his hands and fingers. Our job is to design a processor that will analyze this data. That will then be tested by the nervous system database, or NSDB. And what's the goal? What's the government trying find out? If the subject is lying. Our goal is to use these at every US Port of Entry. To keep out the brown and black sheep trying to get in. Anybody want to say anything? What? Hey, keep your piss over there. Sorry It's over. What do you mean over. I mean we can't move forward with this. We have to. It's a lie detector Billy. And we all are f****** liars. It's bunch of liars writing a software code to catch people like us. What you are talking about? They are going to use on our people. That's not true. You heard her. She said every US port of entry. Yeah, for the black and the brown sheep. You guys are white sheep. We are colored sheep in white sheep's clothing. That's not what I meant. Look if the lie detector test is meant to weed out the worst of the immigrants. You know, if you are criminal or or liar, or threat to the society, then you shouldn't be allowed in. But if you are a decent human being, trying to enter this county legally, sure come on in. I'll buy you a drink. What if we manipulate the system? We create version for ourselves, then we deliver the real product at the very end. No, this can't be done that way. This software is way more complicated. It does not have on off switch. He is right. It can not be done. We have to deliver good product. But how? By doing an honest good job. We were bought here because we are good at what we do. That is what who we are. Forget about our skin color, Billy gave us this opportunity when no one else would. We owe it him and we owe it to ourselves. To be the best versions of ourselves. Let's do this. Alright. I'll make this easy guys. We'll use variables X Y and Z Facial reading will be X. Hand reading is Y. And the Nervous System database is Z. We have 3 cases. Now Case 1, if X=Y then the subject is confident. If X=Y=Z he is confident and telling the truth. However if X=Y does not equal Z, then the subject is confident, but is not telling the truth. Now we have Case 3. X does not equal Y. Then we don't even look at Z because we already know the subject is a liar. Right. Easy stuff. You guys got it? Billy? Yeah! You got it? Yeah. Okay, so Nash, you handle the FRC coding. Ok Dan Dan, the NVM. Will do. Alright. Zorik, you are the business analyst on task. So, I need you to consult with the marketing executives, to get the customer requirements. Ok. If Dave's a dick about it, you know what to do. Right. Cameron, you're the tester. So, start preparing the checklist. Alright guys, let's rock 'n' roll. Wait wait wait. Yeah, you all need touchups. What do we do? Restrooms. Alright. Hi, this is Holly. Yes, with 5k followers. Uhuh. Dave! Dave. Shit, you startled me. Update on Billy and his team. Okay, lets hear it. They are working on something big, but I cant figure out what it is. They're speaking in code. Well, they are software people. No! Like code speak. They are using words like X, Y, Z to talk about the project. Where are they now? The men's restroom. Something about a touch up. Why aren't you there? It's a men's restroom. Ok good point. Let's see what I can find out. Yeah, so I told him that's syphilis brother. Got to get that checked-out. That's disgusting. Yeah. Like a leaky faucet. I'm like your brother Billy. Only, the better-looking one. Yeah, you do look like my brother. We have company. Dave is on his way. Oh shit! Hide the makeup. Go! Go! Go! Just go! Just go! Just go! Hey, Dave. How's that new job treating you over there. Marketing executive, right? Good one, good one to have. Cool Talk later. Psst. Hey, hey buddy. You got any toilet paper over there. I'm all out. Is this a wet nap? Yes, it is. And it's scented? Royal treatment for my royal ass. Do you need another one? Sure, I mean I'm always such a mess down there. Hey buddy, I couldn't help but notice, That your, your middle finger is black. I got my finger stuck up sex doll. Oh. Yes, I should have unplugged it from the wall first. We're all sensitive to water. You may see a gardening tool, but I see the ultimate selfie light. Move, get out of the video. I just saw the most bizarre thing in the restroom. Are they gay? No! It's more than that. More? Like they have both parts? No no no. It's not about the parts. It's about the color. You saw the color of their parts? Yes! No! Well, not exactly. It's like they're coated. Like a powdered donut? Bingo! See, it's not their parts, their hands and faces. What do you mean? Ok. I don't think these people are really white. Ew, gross. Nonwhites? What do we do? Watson. We'll start our own investigation and get to the bottom of this. Who's Watson? Get with the program. What's your password? Dave is gay. I knew that, password? No, that's my password "dave is gay" Oh, that great password! Thank you. Hi Ms. Davenport. Mike The King of pop. Ms. Davenport, the Queen. Would you come over here and, fix my hardware? Well, come on. Don't be shy. Okay, sure. You're a handsome fellow, You know that? Thank you. Do you have a girlfriend? Well... I do have You think I'm pretty? Sure, you are. Oh, that looks like you have a spot. Right there. Someone needs to change their pants. I will take care of it. No no no I insist. Please, don't. Do I have to get rough with you? Don't Don't Don't Oh my god. That's the Sunburn from the Bahamas actually. Oh, exotic. Well, baby, let me just go ahead and burn your lips while we're at it. Mike! Oh no, okay. Sorry, Ms. Davenport, but I need him. I need him! Well, I need him for the deadline. No No No. Come on, let's go. Pull your pants up. My computer is still broken. Hey it's Dan, right? Yes. Dan, how's your day going? Ok... How has your day been? Ohh, not so good. No sirree. My girlfriend, she just broke up with me. Left me for a damn chink. Can you believe that? What's wrong with chinks? Dude, come on what planet are you from? You know, Chinks, they got the little, tiny, ultra, microscopic penises. You must have seen lot of Chinese dicks to come to that conclusion. I mean, you know that's the thing, you don't have to actually see them. Just have a look at their crotch and you can tell. Ohhhh What's the matter, Dan? Cat got your dick? No. Coffee got your dick. I got a bad feeling about Cameron at lunch. He's got that black kind of vibe going on and he refused to eat pork. Sounds like foreign shit to me. The Mongoloid spilled coffee on my dick, it still hurts. These guys are too phenomenal at software. They can't be white. Stop! My office! Right now! What is the meaning of all of this? I was just trying to use the restroom. Dave, I was born at night, but certainly not last night. You and Holly have some explaining to do. Ms. Davenport, we were simply trying to show you something. In the men's restroom? What kind of software company are we running here? Ms., there's something you really ought to know. It's about these guys. Go on. OK lets see. How do I put this? They're really not Caucasian. In fact, probably not even American. Okay, that's offensive. It's true! They're hiding something. This is absurd. Take a look at these dashingly handsome white men. Have you two gone color blind? They're wearing a disguise. It's makeup. Prove it. Move Stop it! Give me that! You apologize to Zachary, right now Spray it on Mike! He's definitely wearing makeup. No. Mike is white. He's just terribly sunburnt from the waist down. I know, I checked. But... That's enough Holly. I don't know what's gotten into you two. From what I understand, the two of you were moved into marketing. A significantly lower paying job. If you keep it up, you'll be working in sanitation. Consider this your first warning. Billy, have you completed the task? Almost there. Good, you and I have a meeting with the senior manager in 30 minutes. Can you manage that? Absolutely. And where is Cameron? He is fixing his hardware, you know what I mean. Well I need that done soon. Dave and holly were onto us. They tried everything they could to try and expose our identities. God, Man. why did it have to be a three prong plug. What's this? A signal jammer. You have your own jammer? I modeled the product a couple of weeks ago. It's suppose to block electronic signals. We can block their communication. Exactly. Billy will have to do the demo meeting on his own. Check check. One-two. Check check. Nothing, I can't hear nothing. Me neither. No. Nothing. No wifi. Oh God, what am I gonna do Billy, you ready? Yes Can you hear me, check check. 1 2 3 Billy? Are you there Billy? So our FRC has been carefully calibrated to pick up the most minute differences between subtle biometrics. Ah Bllly Do you have anything you'd like to add? Oh yes, well you have pretty much covered everything. But.. Write unbeatable code. That will be able to screen the test subjects for any discrepancies. How's this different from the current detectors on the market? Billy? Different. Different. Uhhhh... It is different. Uhhh Because, well we are using the most telling feature of the humanity, which is face. Are you are you a poker player sir? Yeah Well even the most casual poker players Faces have a natural flair or How many times a person blinks speaks volumes to their behavior. What about the software screening these biometric use. Software screening is like a lot of stuff like, you know, a lot of technical jargon. Stuff you know. I'm sure you're used to writing code. It's like java, you know, data mining. You know... it's a bunch of pushing stuff like biometrics and readers. *gibberish* Alright. Ok Congratulations guys. You did it. A job well done team! The company is treating all employees to a special camping retreat for the weekend. I expect all of you to be there. Yes, camping! Sweating, swimming. Sleeping over night. Closed quarters.. Shit. Hey, this is our chance. Holly. We're in the outdoors, away from the office walls, there's no technology to get in the way. I can't get a signal out here. Can you get anything? Holly!? Oh wait here we go! YAY SIGNAL! Were you saying something? Never mind. Just pay attention next time. Oh look who's coming? Hey Dave! Holly. What do you want? I'll take one of these burgers. Thank you Holly. Alright.. This is great. Isn't this nice holly? It's an amicable exchange. Ew. I'm not going to agree with you. That's too bad cause I was going to talk to you about promoting something. I'm already promoting tons of stuff. Yeah, but you're stuff is really cheap and weird. I mean, you know that right? What's your point? My point is.. Do you know why you can't get past 5,000 followers? Why? Cause, your content sucks. Okay? You don't have a cause. You don't stand for anything, but you're pretty. And that's why these cheap companies pay you cheap money to sell their products. But, if they knew your value then you'd be getting paid a lot more. Don't listen to him Holly. He's up to something. Not everybody's always up to something Dave. Okay, what is it that you'd like me to promote? It's this pin. It's my niece, she's promoting left handedness. I'm left handed. So is my niece. Okay, why is there awareness for being left handed? That's not a real cause! Wow, that's real insensitive Dave. This world unfairly caters to right handed people. You know, Jimmy Hendricks flipped his guitar the other way because they didn't make left handed guitars back then. It's true, it's a real cause Dave. I'm wearing it, and I'm going to promote it all weekend! I stand for something, I have a cause! There you go! Now watch those likes and followers move right up! Left handed high five? Cool. See you guys. I can't believe you're going to wear that pin! You wouldn't unterstand, Dave. Well think about what Billy did! I mean left handed or right handed, he screwed us both. You're right. Okay, well now look, we just need to expose them. Alright? And then we can get our old jobs back and get in Ms. Davenport's good graces. What do you suppose we do? Okay look, here's a suggestion box for the upcoming group games. All we have to do is get them into games that will compromise them. What if our suggestions never get picked? Well we'll empty out everyone else's suggestions, and fill the box up with our own. Okay, sounds like a plan. What are we suggesting? Have you every heard of Beer Pong? Beer Pong? I know Ping Pong. Oh is that neighbor of yours? Racist bastard. You guys are missing the point. What's wrong with little beer pong? The four of you need to practice a little restraint. Restraint from what? It's just a couple of drinks Billy. Not with Beer Pong. Okay, it's a lot of drinks. We knew nothing about the American camping experience. It was so weird to perform a dance routine around the campfire Yes, it is a little unusual. It'll get more weirder, I promise. That's why, you never want to pee in the river in Peru. Yeah those parasites will swim right up your pee stream. Get right inside you. Oh. Ew gross! I have a story! Sure Dave. Okay, once upon a time, I had a great job. Then, I had to work for a stupid immigrant. Now, I work with Billy and a bunch of- An upbeat story Dave. Let's leave work at work? Fine. Why doesn't Zachary share something? Okay. Uh, once upon a time... There was a little boy with a little dog. Oh no no no no it's gets better. So the dad comes home one night, and he has a present for his little boy and the dog. A real tear dripper isn't it? No no no no just, just wait. So the dog, he makes his cute little face and unwraps the present. They open it and they see a watch and it's attached to a bundle of dynamites. Three, two, one, Kablooey! The boy is crying like a little bitch, and the dad says that is what happens when you don't clean up your dog's shit. So, the boy he's totally pissed. Grabs an axe, climbs on top of his father's back and chops his head off in twenty tries. The end. Oh, you know my father used to tell me that story before bedtime. Dan you've been a little quiet. Do you have any stories for us? Maybe a vacation story? Yes. We went on vacation to Florida one time to catch the fall colours and it was freezing cold that year. In Florida? Yes, when we got there, there was a terrible snow blizzard. Hey when was this? Last year, we went on the Fourth of July weekend and we wore scary costumes. Sounds a lot like halloween. Don't steal the man's spotlight. Please continue. The next day, I was chopping firewood, when a Polar Bear found me. He chased me through the woods and I ran and I ran and I closed the door to my cabin just in time. I almost died. Well, it's a good thing you made it to the cabin, otherwise you might have swallowed up by the big blue whale. How did you know? You've been looking at my Instagram haven't you? Here we go, team America. It's a party! Alright You guys having fun? Now I'm not having fun…Billy. Woah Come on Holly. I was just going to tell you, you can bounce it if you want to. Next time. Next time. Please please please That's fine. That is fine. That's fine. Can I go? Is it my turn? Alright. No no no no… I think you need to go to other side. Alright buddy. Alright, come on. Why don't you go join your own team. Ok that's fine Alright. Here we go. Put the American first. Step back Ok. That's fine.. That's fine, come on Ohhhh. It's ok.. it's ok. I'll drink the next one. I'll drink the next one. It's all yours. Good job! It's mine, mine. Cool! Whoa! Ok. I'll drink these. Excuse me, Ms. Davenport? Yes? We just want you to know that these guys are not for real. We can prove it. Ms. Davenport they're so drunk, just ask them where they're from. They'll tell you the truth. Ohh, where are you from? I have a funny story. What if I told you, I am not from Montana. You guys are good at it. I don't come from Montana, I am from China. Ha Ha Ha You are funny. Ask! Ask! Ask! Ms. Davenport just look. Davenport want's you. Ms. Davenport? Ms. Davenport? Wait, papers over there, lay it on my desk. Enough of this. What? What? What? Dave? Dave. Dave? How drunk did I get last night? What's gotten in to you? Is this Holly's hat? I don't know. Do you remember last night what the new guys said. Damn it Dave. I haven't been that drunk since 11th grade homecoming. I was beginning to feel more relaxed. So far we have gone through all the hurdles thrown in our way by Dave and Holly. But it was nature at the end, who beat us. Sure your friends are going to be okay peeing by themselves? Yeah they will... I just know how much you guys like to support each other in there. Nah Oh my god. Natalie I can explain. Don't touch me. You're fired. You're all fired! What about the demo? You don't care about it? If any of you show up tomorrow, I'll press charges. Or have you deported! You got that?! Billy... We felt terrible for deceiving everyone. So, we decided on going to the office one last time, and apologizing for it. I thought I told you guys not to show up. You did, but we did anyway. Look, we're really sorry about everything. You trusted us, and we took advantage of it. We weren't trying to. We just needed the job. Regardless, you gave us great opportunity. We hope, that my work was satisfactory. Aa.. Our work. That's it. We just wanted to tell you in person. We're sorry. Let's go guys. Wait! Don't' you guys have a demo to do today? It's kind of happening right now. Yeah. Sure. Ladies and gentlemen let me present to you, our project lead Mr. Billy Ryan and his team. I will let Billy and his team explain the lie detector machine. Thank you Ms. Davenport. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. The facial reading camera, natural vibrations monitor, and nervous system database compiled together, to create the ultimate lie detector. What goes in to it? Really just a bunch of boring code and It's frankly pretty dense and confusing, but the most important thing is the outcome. Okay Nash. Tell us your name. I am Avinash, Nash for short. For the past month, I was called Mike. Ding Alright, tell us about yourself Nash. Ding Alright, tell us about yourself Nash. I am from India. My father saved up some money, he bought 2 acres of land and built the small house in it. Even before I was born. Our dream is to build a school for the local children who are poor, and I have a sister who is preparing for marriage. So, I want to pay for it and also attend the wedding myself. As I recall, you also graduated at the top of your class, is that correct? Yes. And where did you get the degree from? MIT. MIT. Alright. How did you get in to MIT? I took a student loan from bank in India. That helped me. And um How are you doing on paying the loan back? For from it. The tuition fee is 50000 dollars. Which is 3.3 million rupees in India. What happens if you don't pay the bank back? The house that my father built will be taken away Our land will be seized and dream of building the school for the poor will be taken along with it. The wedding have to be cancelled. Would you consider development of this software conflict of interest? No, I believe in the greatness of America. It's my privilege and honor to be a part in strengthening this nation. Thank you Nash. Zorik? Okay Zorik, what do you do? I am a hacker from Russia. Do you enjoy hacking? Yes. Tell us about it. In the Russia internet is censored. The government controls the masses by suppressing the ideology that could truly liberate its people. We don't have free access to literature of democracy. Because real democracy is threat to the Kremlin. I seek out the truth by hacking into the security networks. But you are not looking to hurt anyone? No, no I'm looking for social progress. Alright thanks Zorik, I appreciate it. Dan Dan? Last but not least Okay Dan Dan, what is your background? I am from China, and I am also a software engineer. Growing up I always loved American movies. I always dreamed of coming to the US, because I thought it was so cool. I had just finished University and I was looking for a job when I got an email for a job opening in the US. So you came here for a job opportunity. Yes, but mostly for the American experience. And what is the American experience? Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, good people, and friends. How is your experience so far? The best ever. I'm hoping this experience will help me in starting my own company in China. Okay Dan Dan, you can take your seat, thank you. Okay folks, I think that about does it. Right? Would you mind if I take the test? Not at all I, don't see why that's a problem. Okay first off, I would like to say how thoroughly impressed I am by these guys for creating this. Let's give them a round of applause. Let's have some fun. Okay. Like this? Yeah, just like that. Do you work for the government? Yes. Have you ever eaten your toenails? No. You have to keep it truthful now. Let's refrain from asking personal questions. I'm afraid I can't do that, we have to get to know you and see if you're trustworthy. Fair enough. Okay, do you think Zorik is bangable? He's okay. All right, all right what will you use this technology for? Only at US ports of Entry. Plus every courtroom everywhere. So, what do you think of Nash, Cameron, Dan Dan, and Zorik? How do I feel about these guys. Aside from their accents, they are Americans to me. Well you guys did it! Yeah, just give us a minute and we'll clear our desks. There won't be any need for that. You guys screwed up royally, but you also contributed immensely to this company. Not to mention the country, I want you all guys all back here tomorrow. Really? Yeah, we have lots of work to do. All right. But leave the makeup off, you guys look a lot cuter this way. Was it that bad? Excuse me, Homeland Security, come with me. F*** man. Are you kidding? Is this a joke? How did they know? How do you think? I can't believe Holly isn't tweeting about this yet. Where is she? Oh yeah, Holly, she got arrested for selling fake boner pills off her social media. We were detained by the Department of Homeland Security, and kept in a holding cell. We all knew it was the end of us, and we were being deported. But, something really unexpected happened. The US government pardoned us. They said that the work we have done is recognized as a service for the country and just like that we were free again. Soon after, we were all in high demand. We all landed jobs developing highly classified projects for different companies in the US. Sounds like you all hit the jackpot. Well, the American dream is the jackpot. Everything else is an added perk to it. Well, here's where I get off. Nash, you've got an incredible story. Thank you for sharing this I can't wait to start writing about this. I'm glad we talked this was the best interview, and thanks for bringing all the memories back. Anything you want to leave us with? Yes, I got the citizenship and that's the highest honor of my life. As a piece of advice, I would say, do not react to any situation in life always respond to it. Thats amazing, congratulations. Roger, please drop her back at her place.
