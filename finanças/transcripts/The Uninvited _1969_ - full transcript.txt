The Uninvited It's you? It's silly but I fell asleep. What time is it? Quite late. It's past midnight. But you were supposed to come back yesterday. I couldn't. I told you. Yes, that's right. What's up? Is something wrong? No. How did it go? Did it go well? Yes. Really? Yes. Did you miss me a little bit? Yes? It's the last time I let you go like that. Is someone here? Yes. But why didn't you tell me? Who is it? Wait, let me explain. Wait. This is Lorna. Bergen's daughter. You remember Bergen, the professor? He has a chair in London now. She's staying in Paris. She's going to learn French. We did the trip together. Can I help you? Sit down. She doesn't understand French? Only a few words. Is this her first time in Paris? Yes. You want to eat something? No. We're not very hungry. Not even a salad? It's ready. So? How did it go during all that time? Nothing special? No. I had a small accident with the car but I got it fixed. And I saw Christine and Bernard, several times. They're nice, you know, once you get to know them. Is it true? Did everything go well? Classes in the morning. Laboratory in the afternoon. I was a bit fed up at the end. You're tired? You know, rain... And it's tiring driving at night. I'm a bit dopey. But you'll see... When we are at the beach, we'll sleep as much as we want. We'll hike and even sail if we cover up enough. Sail? Don't you remember? We were supposed to leave tomorrow morning. They're expecting us. They've even called. This morning again. Yes, of course. You don't remember? No. No, but it's because I just got back. We'll talk about it tomorrow. Is she interested in biology too? No. She wants to do theatre. Really? Where is she going to take classes? I don't know. Actually, with a former actor. I think. We should find her a hotel. I'll go with her later. She can sleep on the couch if you want. It'll save you going back out. It's ready. Sit down. It's exactly my size, you chose well. She tried it on for you. Isn't it strange? It's in fashion now. It comes from India. You're not eating? No, I'm not very hungry. You know, when you just wake up. We spent a weekend on the beach. And when we got back on the train, it was full. There were women wearing silly hats with flowers. Are you OK? I feel dizzy. Sit down. There. Have a drink. Is it better? Yes. Do you often have it? No. It's because I worked a lot. I was exhausted. In the evening... Coming back alone. We don't hear anything here. Not a single sound. I was scared. I've even bought sleeping pills because I couldn't sleep. It's true. Do you like me? You know... I wanted to tell you... We'll leave the day after tomorrow. Whenever you want. It doesn't matter. OK? Watch out, she could come in. You're crazy. But what is she doing? Let me get her. No wait a minute. It's ready. Good night. I used to see her often at the Bergen's. One day, she asked me if I was happy. I said: Yes, of course. I love my job. I have a young wife, pretty and smart. The more I was singing your praises, the more ridiculous I felt. You know... I thought that if something like this happened to me... I would be... Well. I wouldn't want to see you again. I thought it would be over between us. No. Not at all. On the contrary. Even more. That's it. And when I came... When I saw you... Suddenly I saw you like a woman. Not like my wife. Do you understand? I could feel that I love you. You. I need you to understand. Otherwise, it would have been a misunderstanding between us. Everything. From the beginning. We've been together for four years. So if anything happens to me, you have to know, to understand. I need... What are you doing? You don't understand. You don't want to understand. Listen, give me some time. Where are you going? If you come close, I'll scream. Stop here. It's closed today. Speaking. I'm leaving right now. Give me time to come at least. They'll have to wait. Yes, I'll bring everything with me. If I'd been warned earlier, I'd already be there. Fine, you'll tell me later. Is Mr Cherez here? Good. It takes me four hours, so let's say around noon. OK. Weren't you supposed to be away? Yes. I missed my plane. I'm going to the south. No one works here today, As you know. Yes, but... I had some work to finish, so I came. What's the matter? Is there something wrong? No. I haven't slept much. That's all. Have you seen Souvel's case? Pierre was supposed to deal with it. You don't know where it is either? You don't have any idea? I don't know. I'm not aware. I don't understand anything. It's Daniel who printed them, maybe he knows something. Do you mind calling him? Hello? Is it Mrs Brisseau? Hi, I'm sorry to bother you so early. Is Daniel there? He's left? Yes. It was about work. He knew, yes. Mr Desailly needs it now. Yes, it's important. It's kind of you. Do you think I can reach him there? Thank you. I'll try immediately, thank you very much. Bye. Hello? Excuse me sir, is Daniel Brisseau there? Thank you. Hello? It's me, Anne. Listen, I'm in a hurry. I'm at the office. The Souvel's case, we can't find it. Sorry? I'll have a look, hold on. We didn't think about it, you're right. Yes. I'll explain. Yes, he's here. In a hurry. Bye. It was in the hall. We left it there, in full view. We wanted to let you know but... Sorry. Fine. I'm going then. Do you take much of... this stuff? I couldn't sleep. When you're tired... I wanted to ask you. If I could have a few more days. To have a rest. The week? OK. You need it. You said you were going to the south? Yes, to the sea. My husband is there already. He left directly. Are you taking the plane for Nice? No, Marseille. Tonight, at 9.30 pm. I'm going over there too, I can drive you if you want. We'll get there before your plane. You could be useful on the building site, I have to stop there. But... I'm so tired, I wouldn't want to... You'll sleep in the car. Do you have any luggage? No. Fine. Shall we go? Are you cold? Do you want me to shut the window? Do you want to put the seat down? You could lie down to sleep. No, thank you. What weather. It's awful. I have to go fast, we're so late now. With this plan business. Thank you. We'll be there soon. Ten minutes. Sir. A full tank please. And check the tyres too. - And do the windscreen. - Fine. Do you want a coffee? - No, thank you. - It'd be good for you. - How much do I owe you? - 40 francs, please. - Do you know where she's gone? - Over there. Thank you. It was dirty. - Is Mr Cherez here? - Yes, over there. He's waiting for you, Here they are. Hello. I'll be ten minutes. We'll leave straight after. Stay there. So, Mr Desailly, what do you think? I don't understand. We've done all the sounding though. We didn't detect this water layer. But it's here. We need an explanation. Maybe it's the thaw. No, I'm sorry, I disagree. It can't explain so much water. We've taken all the soundings Do you want to check inside? It's got nothing to do with it. Mr Cherez, come in. It's not wide enough. If you don't trust us, call a geologist. Give me that. So. Here we have the building. That's it. Here is the ground. If we get the level of the water outcrop. In the trench, we should have the water to that level. But the water can come from under the building. We can't know. Well below. The other possibility, is that there is a resurgence, very localised, with no danger. But I'm not sure. Because if necessary, you understand that... If necessary, we'll build a waterproof lining in all the existing basements. A lining? But that's a disaster, do you realise? And how much will this cost me? I'm not paying for the extra work. Doesn't it work? Let me have a look. Excuse me. 16. What's your number? 20 47 43. 47 43. That's it. Say something. Give it to me. Hello? We're calling from Souvel, sir. Sorry? I don't know. A young lady made the call. Hold on. Who is it from, miss? Wait. Hold on. Miss. Anne. Anne. Anne. Anne, what's the matter? What are you doing? Leave me alone. I told you to wait. What's the matter? It's ridiculous. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Let me go. Don't worry. I'm coming back. Try to talk. Try to explain, you'll see. You'll feel better. Is it your husband? He's not on the coast? He's not waiting for you? And your friends, the ones you mentioned, do they exist? Do you still want to go there or not? Is it that bad? Is it that bad? Come on, sit up. I'm sorry, I was unpleasant this morning, I didn't realise. Sit up straight. - Are you better? - Yes. There. Wear this or you'll get a cold. You could have at least parked it better than that. Yes. Fine, I'll do it now. Here's the sun. If you want sunglasses, there's a pair in the glovebox. Where do your friends live again? At Le Grau-Du-Roi, in the port. They rented a house. It's not too far from ours. We go through Avignon, Nimes, Montpellier. Then I drive along the coast and I'm home. Close to Saintes-Maries. I built it after the war, when I worked in Marseille. It's very small. We were lucky, it's not very built-up around there. It's still beautiful. We won't arrive tonight. We'll stop on the way somewhere. It's up to you. You'll go to your friends' tomorrow. You can stay at ours if you want. I'll let you think. There's something I wanted to see, it's close to here. We'll stop a minute. Do you mind? What is it? Let's go. You'll like it. Don't you recognise it? Yes. But I thought it was smaller. I'll have a quick look around. Here you have the heating. You'll be warm. Do you like it? And you? I don't know. It's arguable. This great wall not supporting anything. It's hollow. The roof is in concrete, why? Maybe nothing is practical in this church. Maybe it's better if nothing is practical. At least, he did what he wanted. Have you met him? Le Corbusier? I worked with him. I even worked with him here. Was it good? We used to all work together, we had plans. We had faith. We thought we would change the world. Then he died. And you? Me? I became an architect. I have an agency, employees, I earn money. That's what we call success. It's visible. I'm sorry for this morning. I made you mess up everything with my stories. It was meant to happen sooner or later. The man with glasses, on the building site, what did he want? He just wanted to save money, that's all. It happens all the time. Is he allowed to? He has the money. We work on a project, we live through it, we design it. It's a bit like a child. And slowly, they turn it into a monster. There's nothing we can do. You're lucky with your brushes and your paints. And... I'd like not to talk about architecture for the next two days, I've had enough. Come on, let's go, it's cold here. It's impressive. Sorry? What is? This place, like this, empty. This silence. In the summer, there's always a lot of people. They're on the lawn, having picnics. I prefer it deserted, like this, in the winter. - I lost you. - Yes. Brilliant. Where did you buy them? - On the main or side street? - On the side street. What should we do? Should we stop here? We can drive a bit more if you want. I'd like to. It's practical that stuff. Wait. You have to wait for the click. That's all we needed. I wanted to use the shortcuts through the mountains, and there we are. It's beautiful around here. I like to drive at night. Perfect. We might be blocked by the snow. As it's beautiful, it's perfect. You're smiling, at last. If you're tired, I can drive. No. You're not used to it. You must dive slowly, it's dangerous. Do you use this road often? Sometimes, since I have this construction. Each time I go to the sea. Does your wife still live in the south? Yes. She works in Marseille, she was born there. Is he going to let me overtake? He's nice. How is she? - How is she? - Yes. She's a remarkable woman, very smart. Is she not pretty? Very pretty, on the contrary. So why did you say very smart first? I don't know, I said it like this. Watch out. What should we do? It's over. We can't go any further. There's days like this. First, the construction site, then the snow. There's no point insisting. We can't stay here. Come on. We'll find a village or a house. We're there. See, it wasn't that far. - It doesn't look very lively. - But there's some light. Cafe and restaurant. There must be someone. Is someone here? It looks good. - No, don't touch it. - Just a little bit. Don't act like a child. Stop. What if someone came? Good evening, sir. Good evening. Sorry to bother you. It's late but we saw the light. It's midnight, the cafe is closed, sir. My car has broken down. We can't get it out. We need a tractor. Do you know someone who could help us? At this time, I don't know. I'm alone and I have the oven on. It's in the middle of the road, it's annoying. It's not far. I'd be happy to help you, but I don't know what to say. I can't leave, excuse me. - I'll be back right away. - Thank you. - Are we bothering you? - No, come in. Watch the stick. Would you know a hotel nearby? We come from Paris, we drove all day. A hotel? It's very small here you know. You won't find anything around here at this time. But wait a minute. The snowplough will come in about 15 minutes. It always comes here. They will be able to help you with your car. They're from here. - They're friends. - Thank you, it's very kind. It's beautiful. I haven't seen that for years. You like it? What is it? It's a local biscuit. It's for celebrations. - How do you make it? - It's a bread dough. We add some milk, butter, eggs, sugar. It's the cake we make for celebrations here. A niece is getting married. So I do everything. Biscuits, vol-Au-vent, wedding cake. And the bread, every day. I'm overwhelmed. Where are you going, if you don't mind me asking? Lyon, then the south coast. You're using a strange itinerary from Paris. Thank you. I had a building site to check, then used the back roads. I didn't expect so much snow. Here, you have to know. Especially at night. So you have building sites? Are you in the field? Architect. I see. Here they are. I told you, they always come here to have a drink. I'm telling you, they like to drink, even in the summer. Come here. Hi guys. This gentleman is from Paris. He doesn't know the way from here. He's passing through. I'll wait for you with the bottle. Hurry up, guys. Don't worry, it will be done in half an hour. - You have all this to do for tomorrow? - Yes. You like it, I can tell. I don't like cakes, but I like making them. Careful with the cream. Not so much at once. She must be happy, your niece. It's her big day. We only get married once. In principle. Yes, in principle. Is she very young your niece? She'll soon be 22. Is she pretty? She's still a kid. That's it, it's fine. Thank you. You know that he almost got stuck too. It wouldn't be the first time. Cheers. Cheers to the Parisians. Do you want some? Yes. So? Is everything OK? Yes, thank you. - You aren't eating with us? - No, thank you, With the oven's heat, eating's not good for you. Some wine? No thank you. Later. I still have work to do. - He's nice, isn't he? - Yes, I like him. Are you done? Yes, I just need to put it in the oven. - How many batches are you doing? - Three. How long does it take you? Around 40 minutes each. Do you want to try some? It's very good. You look tired. And you've driven all day. And you've worked hard here. I'm fine, on the contrary. We're going to leave you. We have to go. But... You're not going to go back on the road at this time. We have to. At this time, you won't find anything, it's all closed. So... I thought... You would stay here. Listen, you're very kind. They're our rooms you know. It's very simple. And that's all I have to offer. I've prepared it all. Anyway, I can show you if you want. Come on. Be careful on the stairs. The steps are a bit old. You see, it's simple. It's clean, it's the countryside. That's where I lived when I was single. This is the other room. I have already put the heating on. You can't leave it on for too long. You'll switch it off here, before you go to sleep. It's very nice here. Let me get you some water. In case you get thirsty. Thank you. There. Your bag. It's heavy. You'll have a sleep. You'll feel better. - I'll go downstairs to keep Henri company. - No, stay here. I'd rather. Fine. I'll be here next door. Sleep peacefully. Fran?ois? What's the matter? You're not sleeping? I think I had a dream. What time is it? Late. I opened my eyes and I didn't know where I was. You have to get back to sleep. You don't want to sit here for a while? He's nice, the baker. Did you see what he's done? He prepared everything, without saying anything. Yes. Is he still at work? Is he still baking? Yes. It's 6 am. Fine. It's time to sleep now. Can't you stay here next to me? Do you mind? No. There. Take this. Don't go. Good morning. - Did you sleep well? - Yes. - Do you want some coffee? - Thank you. Sit down. - Do you take sugar? - No. You'll be able to leave now. It's better. Yes. Here's the bride. Yes, it's Nicole. Soon, we'll be out of the snow. Now it's the rain. Look at that. It's horrible. When we think of all the snow and villages. Another world. He's mad. Does he want to die? Don't be scared. Can you drive me to a train station? A train station? Do you want to go to Paris? Maybe. If it's to go to your friends', I can... You did want to go to theirs, no? I don't know anymore. What's this road? We're going to a friend of mine. A sculptor. He works near a quarry, nearby. I haven't seem him for a while, but... It'll be good for you, it'll cheer you up. I can't leave you like that, on your own, at a train station. I have to see him anyway, I have an order for him. It's here. Paul? Is it him who does that? Yes. He must be around. It must be his car. I'll have a look at the quarry. Paul? Be careful. He's here. Paul? It's Fran?ois. This is Paul. Anne. Hi. We looked for you everywhere, all the quarries in the area. - I was told you were here. - Yes, it's been three months. - I've found a house in the end. - Really? I have a nice workshop. You'll see it later. I didn't know. You could have told me. Have you come from Paris? Yes. We left yesterday. Come in, it's cold here. Is that what you're working on at the moment? Yes. I have to start here. Because the stone is too heavy. Is it not too... Is it not too soft? You have to know it. When you leave it outside, it gets harder. It gets a nice colour. The colour of the houses and the rocks of the region, when you arrive. Come and have a look at the house. - Have you eaten? - No. This is the workshop. I dug that into the rock. No, it's not a wall. - Is it in the rock? - Yes. It's a stable. Here is where they used to keep the hay. - I made the stairs. - Really? Come on. It's sturdy. It's big, isn't it? I was lucky. Not bad. I bought the furniture here and there. It's made for an artist. It's very good. There's not enough light. It's a shame, you can't really see. This one is not finished yet. It has to find its strength. Whereas this one, the big one, it's already found its movement. It's beautiful. Do you really mean it? It could stay like that. See, the masses are right. But they have to be tighter. So I have to dig there. Again. And again here. - It's the same as the one over there. - Which one? The yellow one. You see, but this one is lying. While the other one is standing. This one, I call it Prostration. It's beautiful. You have worked a lot. Since I'm here I haven't stopped. I can tell. You look tired. You should be more careful. And does it work? Do you exhibit? Sell? For now, I haven't the time. I work. After, I'll see. It's a shame. You should look into it. You should sell them. I'm in no rush. Let me get changed, I'll be two minutes. Then we'll have lunch. We'll eat a bit but I need to tell you about this project. OK, whenever you want. What is it exactly? A theatre fa?ade. You do what you want, it's a 50 meter fa?ade. 50 metres? - Of what? - Concrete. - Concrete? - That's what's needed. It's interesting. You'll have everything you need. Are you interested? Yes, we'll see. Have a seat, I'll be right back. Coffee? - How many sugars? - Two. Thank you. I'd like you to have a look. - Yes. - Thank you. - I'll write down all the measurements. So you can get an idea. - OK. You're tired. - Don't you want to rest? - No. We'll leave soon. Hello. How are you? - Come and see us tonight? - I've some friends. - Come anyway. Come on in. No. But come with them. Come with us. Bring them. OK? - We're in a hurry. - Ciao. They're pretty, your friends. Do they live here? Yes, one of them is a bookseller. She exhibits paintings too. I've exhibited drawings at hers. Which one? The one in red or yellow? The red one. The one you kissed. I kissed them both. You're not that lonely in the end. - Does it not prevent you from working? - No, on the contrary. Here's me thinking you were a hermit. You're not bored, are you? Not at all. It's nice here. We can breath. And we forget. Listen. Fran?ois? Why don't you stay for the night? I have some friends who would be happy to meet you. They can accommodate you, they have a big house. It's more comfortable than here. And they just invited you. I can't, I have to leave. But you maybe, as you're on holidays. You have time to decide, I'm going to the village to call. - Wait Fran?ois, I'll come with you. - No don't worry. - Can we call from there? - Of course, at the caf?. - What do I do? I go left? - Then right and you'll find the caf?. Fine. See you later. See you later. Paul? Is it you? What time is it? - Around 4 pm. - I heard a noise. - Is Fran?ois here? - Not yet. What's this noise? It's the wind. The weather has changed. - You haven't slept? - Yes, a little bit. You know, I thought about your sculptures. They're beautiful. They seem to come out of the rock on their own. The black one, you know the one that's not standing. What do you call it? Distress. And the one standing in the corner? Expectation. Why did you call them like that? I don't know. Like that. You seem better. You didn't seem to good when you arrived. Is something wrong? Yes. Your husband? Yes. What does he do? He's a biologist. He travels a lot. He's often abroad for conferences. - Was he there when you left? - Yes. He prevented you from leaving? He told me a lot of things. I didn't understand what he was telling me. As if I was in front of someone I didn't know. I got scared. I left like a mad thing without thinking. And now? Now? It's strange, since I'm here, I can't stop thinking about it. It's strange. It seems easy to tell you. You were here? You said nothing? No. I'm going to leave. Have you seen what it's about? Yes, I had a look. Do you want to do it? You'll accept the order? Yes, in principle. Fine, I?ll leave you a plan. I'll give you an advance. No, listen, there's no rush. You'll send it to me. No way. You're hired. It's a first deposit. You'll receive the contract. There. Are you leaving like this? We've hardly talked. I came to talk about that. I told you. So I'm leaving. Do you want me to call your friends? It's up to you. Goodbye. So do I stay here? - What do you want to do? - I'm coming. Thank you. It's nothing major. The wing is bent but the wheel should spin. Try. See. You didn't hurt yourself? Listen, we can't stay here. Do you want me to drive? It's straight ahead, at the end of the quay. You can leave me here. Otherwise you have to go around. It's a one-way street. So. Thank you. It was a nice trip. But you, do you have to go back tomorrow? I don't know. I should. I feel bad. Maybe it's my fault this delay. Give my apologies to your wife. My suitcase. Well. - Want it filling up? - Yes. What's the matter? What are you doing here? Are they not here? You didn't see them? What are you going to do? Aren't you staying here? Come with me. We'll go home. We'll call them from there. Watch out. It's here. All the houses are like that here. Are you coming? Mich?le? Mich?le? What's going on? She's left with some friends, she's not here. You see the sand strips? It's windy. The sea is strong. Come in. You see, it's just this room. A small kitchen. And here, the room. It's OK, it wasn't dead. Do you want to sit down? Do you want to take your coat off? Olive wood is great, it burns immediately. It's her. Fran?ois? Fran?ois? Here you are. How are you? Very well. I saw the car. What happened? Nothing. Good evening. You're not hurt? You're alright? It's fine. I saw the car damaged, the light, I didn't understand. I feel bad to arrive so late, but we were on a boat with Andr? and some friends. I hadn't heard from you. I tried to call you, but I couldn't reach you. It doesn't matter. - Are you OK? - Yes. I'm happy to see you. Come in. I wanted to tell you... This is Anne. She works with me, she's one of my colleagues. My wife. We travelled together, she was meeting some friends, but they were not here. Good evening. Good evening. We had some awful weather. First, we got lost. We had snow. And this stupid accident. You've not had much luck. But have a seat. We also had some bad weather. Yesterday, it rained all day. The sea came all the way to the house. A horrendous wind. This morning, it was nice, it was sunny. And it started again. You don't want to sit down? After lunch, Andr? came to get me. He's bought a new boat. Another one? Yes. He's very proud of it. He insisted on going on a trip. We went to the lakes, you know. Anyway, when we had to come back, the engine broke down. We were far away. We walked for an hour. In the end, it was dark when we got back. Are you OK? Very well. Yes. Your work? Fine. And you? I'm fine. Still the same problems with business services. But I defend myself. - Where do they live your friends? - At Le Grau-Du-Roi, just here. Really? Do you need something? No, thank you. You haven't eaten? No, but it's late. It's ready.
