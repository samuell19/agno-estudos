Richie! Get out of there, you little pinhead! Whoa! Huh! Touch me and die, lady. Ew! Why don't you keep your food in your own pigsty? Are you nuts? That's the first place mom would look. All you think about is food. All you think about is Brad, "The red-hot lover." Brad, the great. Oh, Brad! You have been reading my diary again, haven't you? Brad, "The red-hot lover." Oh! Oh, darling! Oh! If I ever, ever catch you reading this again, I promise, I will... Ooh! "Brad, kiss me, darlin'. "Oh, I love to feel your arms around me." Louise! Up and at 'em! Mom, I'm already up. Breakfast in three minutes. Good morning. Morning, Honey. Morning. God... Mmm, Kitten, you're looking very pretty. I know, Daddy. This is your favorite color. Mmm-hmm. Well, this is my favorite daughter. Hi. Hi. I see prince charming has arrived right on time to pick up Cinderella. You mean Lady Guinevere. Hi! Can you believe it? How does she do that? Genes. Did you see what she was wearing? Oh, who notices what she wears? It was pretty sleazy. I mean, you'd never catch me wearing something like that. I'll say.

One day, we'll be the seniors. Yeah. See you in class. Bye, Poll. Bye. Pax vobiscum, Louise. Hi. Well, um... We just wanted to let you know that you're a candidate. It's in the bag. What? I... I'm sorry. For Latin club president. You're a shoo-in! So, did your dad get you the car? Oh, it's in the works. It doesn't really matter, though. Brad takes me everywhere I want to go anyway. Oh! Door-to-door l'amour. The 16th-century poets raised passion to an art form, and today... Why is it that romance is dead? 'Cause all the chicks are a drag, that's why. Who said that? Well, well. Our honor student has graced us with her presence. Apparently, skipping grades is not enough for Miss Miller. She feels she can also afford to waste our valuable time as well! You people think this is some sort of game, that I have nothing better to do with my time than to stand here and teach senior English? Well, do you, Miss Miller? No, sir. No. No, Mr. Weaver. Papers down to the front. I'll bet not one of you knows who John Donne is. One of the, uh, romantic poets you've been talking about, Mr. Weaver. My question was purely rhetorical, Miss Miller! All right, let's see if anyone in this class has been able to convey his or her idea of romance into words, huh? Now, this one is sticky, but fascinating. "He pressed his lips against mine... "...but he didn't stop there. "Soon, "every inch of my body was covered "with Brad's kisses. "Who would believe tonight I was totally his?" Yes, who indeed? Miss Miller. - What? - Ooh! Bye, Louise! Louise? Don't let Weaver get to you. Everyone knows he's a jerk. I'll never be able to face Brad again, Polly. Hey, cheerleaders, I got the new cheer.

Good luck. We shall have this hour always to remember, the hour before you kissed me, before you said you loved me. I can't wait an hour. Tell me now. Do you think this is something one says just like that? What must I do? Sit in your lap? In my lap of armor? I have ways of removing armor. And my arms, do you think they open to the first comer? I have ways of opening arms... And closing them. Whoo! Brad! Lovely. Very special, all of you. Thank you. That was so good. Ah. Thank you. Uh, the director has decided that, uh, Lawrence will play the king. Brad and... Kiki will play the leads. And Louise will be the assistant costume mistress. Ahhh! Whoa! Ow! God! Uh... Louise. Louise, are you okay? Yes. Here, let me help you. No, I can do it. Here. I'm sorry. I didn't see you. I guess it's my fault. No. It was a failed suicide attempt. Listen, can I take you home? No! Brad, no. Um... You... You don't... You don't have to. I know, but I'd like to. Bradley, she said she's okay. Let's go. Are you sure you're okay? Yes. I... I'm fine. Go. Terrific. Now what am I going to do? Great. Hello? Hello? Approach, my little one. Don't be afraid. Madame Serena knows all, sees all, tells all. Come. Actually, I just came to use your phone. Impossible. I never use a phone. Come. Come! Sit. Look, because it is a stormy night, I will give you a palm-reading at a special price. Well, listen, I'm sorry. I've really... I really got to go. 'Cause I'm kind of late already, and I just... Don't worry. I like you, I like your cutesy little Punky Brewster face. How much of money you have? Um... Let me see... About $6. I knew it. Okay! Please... Put the money on the offering plate and cover it up. Madame Serena must never see the money. Okay... You are still in high school, but that certain somebody doesn't know you're alive. Don't worry. Somebody you already know will become your sweetheart. You will marry him and you will have two children. Can you see who he is? My God in heaven. What did you say your name was? Louise Miller. Miller! It's you! What do you mean, it's me? You're not a mark. You're one of us. One of who? When is your 16th birthday? Oh, wait. Next week. Am I right? Yeah. You will receive these powers on your 16th birthday. What powers? Strange things will start to happen, but you must trust me. Trust me? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Okay. Whatever. ♪ ...which nobody can deny ♪ Yeah. - Happy birthday, sweetheart. Oh, Mother, the cake is really beautiful. What's so sweet about her? Louise, you did mail the invitations, didn't you? Well, yeah. Maybe it's a surprise party. Funny, Richie. Can I have my cake now? Oh, here. Why don't you open your gift before your friends come? Okay. I bought it for you at the young Miss department. It was very expensive. Gee, it's... really... Different. I'm so glad you like it. Oh, I... I love it. It's great, really. No one's coming to your sweet 16 party, Louise. Hello? - Louise. Hi, Polly! The worst possible thing is happening. It's like "birthday on Elm Street." Okay, I run into Kiki and Shawn at the mall. I was getting your birthday present. Randa is having a party! What? I mean, tonight. She's invited everybody after school. Oh. I know. I know. It's like "revenge of the cheerleaders." Yeah, okay. Why don't you come over? Are you okay? Yeah, okay. I'm there. I'll be right over. You will receive these powers on your 16th birthday. Strange things will start to happen, but you must trust me. Trust me. Trust me. But after 20 years of teaching household skills, the board has seen fit to ask me to teach you... Sex education. Adam had one of these. Does anyone know what... What this might represent? A Roger. A loved one. Joystick. Dong. Zipper lizard. Tallywaker. Trouser-snake. Schlong. That... That's enough, Rhet. Thank you. No problem. Now, it's a race against time. Sparky sperm is loose and he's heading for the target, Edna, the egg. And when he reaches it, he makes a baby. Go, Edna. That... That is exactly what we don't want. Not yet. So... Use one of these at all times! It's called a condom. Condom. Condom. Condom. Condom. Condom. Condom. Come on. Will ya? What's the holdup? We ain't got all day. Come on! Here, let me try. Thanks, Brad. It's okay. Oh, divine, divine! Whoo! Thank you. This reminds me when I played Mary, Queen of Scots. Really? You did? Yes, in New Haven. The critics loved me. So what happened? The best reviews in the world, and then two years without a part. Oh, well. I love teaching. Aw, Ms. Malloy. I love you. Aww. I mean, you're just not like the other teachers. Darling, all the world's a stage! Ms. Malloy, my life is a walking, talking tragedy. Louise, my dear, there's so much of you in me it hurts. Oh, I've never seen this before. That's cool. Take a look, dear. It's very old. That's really strange. Do you like it? Yeah. I think you should keep it. Me? Absolutely. I believe it'll bring you luck. Oh, I feel different already. Louise. My cousin David is coming from out of town, and he needs a date for the dance Friday, so I was wondering if you'd like to come with us. Well, I... Sure! Okay! Great. We'll pick you up about 8:00. See ya. Okay. Bye! Bye! See ya there! I mean, here! I... I mean... then. Do you believe that? Not really. Well, I guess everybody else already had a date. Louise, she didn't ask me. Maybe she's really starting to like you. Randa? Well, maybe your luck is starting to change. Oh, my God. What are you going to wear? Dad? Oh, come on, kitten. Why the long face? That outfit your mother bought you looks great on you. Dad... This... This is what everybody's wearing. I look like such a geek. Dad, she has no idea what it's like for me. Now I'm going to show you something. Dad, just forget it, okay? I've already seen mom's senior picture. No, no, no. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Ah. Hmm. Ew! So who's that? That is your mom in junior high. Oh! That's mom? Oh, Frank, that's a terrible picture of me! No, Mom! I think you look really... sweet. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. They're here! How do I look? Knock 'em dead, kitten. You look very sweet. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. Hi. I'm David, Randa's cousin. Ready? Wow, I love your look, complete with beaver cleaver advance. You are going to wear your glasses, aren't you? I don't wear glasses. Huh. Shall we? Hey, Kids! Welcome to your harvest dance! Yeah, time to sow some wild oats! I'm Ramondo, your favorite radio deejay. Listen, you're out here to have fun, you know. If you don't dance, we shoot at your feet. Whoa! Ho-ho! Look, uh, can you just go ahead? I...

I had to come alone. God... I wish he'd just look at me. Oh, my God! He's looking right at you! I wish he'd just come over. Excuse me. I need to talk to you. Can we step outside? Sure... Brad. Boy, look at those stars. Yeah. You know, the closest one is four light-years away. Did you know, if we made a wish on it, it wouldn't come true for eight years. Yes, that's... I'm sorry. I just... When I'm nervous, I just can't stop talking. Well, what are you nervous about? Well, you know... Being this close to you. I'm sorry. Well, what did you want to talk to me about? Well... can I speak freely to you? Sure. Of course. I have a little brother. I know about men. Can I come over to your house tomorrow night? Well, my parents are going to be home. That's okay. Huh? Yeah, well, I'd like you to help me with my English paper. Oh. Love to. Great. Oh, thanks. You know how Mr. Weaver is, and if I don't improve on my grade, I won't be able to play football, and that pretty much blows any chance of SC. Having fun? Give David your keys. We're going over to Kiki's in her car. Thanks, Sport. Bye. Ahem. The night's young. Let's party. I can drive through a fog like a hog with a hard-on. Let's go, Wolf Man. Uh, David, this is not the way to Kiki's. Says whom? Give me some soul kisses, baby! Ugh! How would you like it if somebody groped you? I'd love it, baby! Come on! Hey, I got an idea! Let's do it while we're movin'! David! Stop it! David! Ahhh! Knock it off! Give me one kiss and I'll be nice! Hah! I wish you would just leave me alone! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Oh, no! What am I gonna do? How do I get him back? I don't know what to do. Madame Serena. Madame Serena will know what to do. Oh, what if mom finds out, she'll kill me! Oh, no. Looks like she's home now. Serena. Serena, you're not gonna believe this. Please, be here. Oh, be here. Open up! Hello? Hello? Oh, no! She's closed. Where's mom? Out. What are you supposed to be? This is disgusting! You better clean this mess up before mom gets home. I don't have to. I am telling you, I don't want to listen to her yell at you. You are an unbelievable pig! I'm rubber, you're glue. Whatever you call me sticks back on you. No. I'm rubber, you're glue. Whatever you call me sticks back on you! You think you're hot stuff 'cause you went to a dance. Dream on! Nobody wants to date you, because you're a dog. A dog! A dog! Hey, I feel funny. Can't stand up! You are standing up. I'm a dog! Louise, what did you do to me? You! You... Nothing! Nothing I can't fix. It was just a mistake! I can fix it! Look at me! I'm a... Look at all this hair on me! I even smell like a dog! Aw man wait... Richie! Come back! I got to get out of here! Help! Richie, I promise I can fix it! Just... It's mom! She hates dogs! Can we... She'll take me off to the pound. Louise, we got to do something. I can change you back. Whoo, you stink! I've got an idea. A bath? This is your great idea? You don't want to go to the pound, do you? Let me go! They kill dogs at the pound. What are you doing? I definitely promise to fix this... What's going on? Just as soon as my friend gets back. I hate baths! There's water! No! No! No! You've been acting crazy! Ahhh! Richie! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Let me out, you sucker! You pervert! What did I tell you? At 16, your powers would come into play. And you know, the really weird thing is, I don't even know how I changed him back. You didn't. Beginners' spells are very weak. They wear off. Water reverses them. They'll get stronger. Me? A witch? You have the power to make anything you want happen. You mean like make potions and curses and all that junk? Where'd you get that? What? Oh, um, at school. Why? I think it's time you saw something. There comes a time in every witch's life that she must see this. You won't believe it. Here it is, "New faces of 1652." Look here. That's you, and you were wearing the same amulet that you're wearing now. And that's me. You're kidding! Mmm. Then why did I get the amulet again? Because it belongs to you. You belong to it. It's a symbol of your power. I wasn't even looking for it. But it was looking for you. That's the way magic works. Here... Read this. Brush up on your basics. You're a very lucky girl. We can even make our own money. Come on. I'll show you. First, a lump of coal. Now, put your hand over it. Come on. Repeat after me. Arra arralon shem hemforus. Arra arralon shem hemforus.

Yeah. They do. Don't you know what this means? We can change all that, make them respect you. It'll be fun! We can? There's somebody you want to get back on, right? Well, maybe. Sure. I know what it's like to be 16. I've been 16 four times already. Liebchen, with me in your corner, they won't have Louise Miller to kick around anymore. Thanks.

Uh, the answer I am waiting for is, what is Hamlet calling into question? His... Ah! No! His manhood, you idiots! What is the matter with you people? His manhood! Mr. Weaver! Hot. It's okay, Mr. Weaver. With a little rest, you'll be just fine. - Hmm... Trust me. Wow! Oh! Mr. Weaver! Are you all right, Weaver? You okay? What next? Oh... How could Richie do this?

I'm sorry I'm late, it's just that the most amazing things have been happening. I know. I won the state lottery. Really? Yes! The whole thing. And the weird thing is, I never even bought a ticket! I got this letter in the mail, and then I looked in the pocket of my brown sweater and there was this ticket! Then I realized how perfectly shabby I was looking, so I bought a whole new wardrobe. Oh!

Hurry up. Brad? Isn't this great? Oh, you scared me. Yeah. This is... It's neat. You know... Brad? Great. Psst. He took the long way, and then he kissed you. How did you know? I'm your Serena, dear. I know everything. Yeah, but why? Why did he kiss me? Was it because of the spell? What's the difference? You're irresistible. That's what you wanted. Yeah, but if it was because of the spell, then, I mean, how do I know he really cares? Louise, darling, what's the difference? The difference is, I don't want him to just suddenly stop liking me. Well, that happens with or without magic. Not if love is real. Falling in love is just a trick anyway. The right lighting, the right music, the right haircut... People fall in love and then... One day it's over. When he kissed me, was he really kissing me? Louise, nothing lasts forever. That is just too depressing to believe. I mean, some people fall in love, and they stay in love. Hi, Louise. Hi. I love her hair. What a radical outfit, Louise. You're so funny, too. I wish I looked like Louise. I wish I was Louise. Oh, yeah. My, aren't we trendsetting this morning. You know, this is so weird. Everybody looks like me. Well, the price of fame and fortune is to be envied, then copied, and finally discarded. Says who? I read it someplace. Probably Rob Lowe. "My dearest, Louise, "Armando and I have done Europe twice already "and now we are in Aruba. "Armando is teaching me Spanish. "I'm so happy. You brought me luck, Louise "and I love you for it. "Con amor, siempre. "With love, always, Edith Malloy." "Con amor, siempre" Con amor, siempre. Oh, Louise. My first lead in the school play. I'm so excited. Yeah. Too bad Ms. Malloy isn't here to see it. Hurry up, girls. And don't say good luck. Why not? Show biz superstition. Okay. There. Break a leg. Huh? "Break a leg", that's what you're supposed to say. Oh. Neat. You're on, Kiki. Okay. Break a leg, Kiki! I can't move it. It's broken. Kiki, I... I didn't mean it. Louise, you're the understudy. You'll have to play it. Jeez, Louise. What did you do, trip her? Hey. Hey. I hear you got the lead in the school play. Yeah. Well, it looks like Cinderella is finally going to the ball? Yeah. The dance. What's the matter? Glass slipper doesn't fit? Yeah. I guess so. It's like when you really need someone to notice you, they don't, you know? But you know, kitten, it doesn't really matter how other people see you. What matters is... How you see yourself. Thanks, Dad. Hi. How are you? Why? God... Polly. Come on. We used to be friends. You never talk to me anymore. "Used to" is the operative word. Why don't I ever see you? Maybe I don't want to have to make an appointment. You're so busy now. God, I thought you'd be happy for me. Delighted. Oh, come on, Polly. I really miss you. Why? You need another dweeb hanging on your every precious word? Believe it or not, I care about you, okay? Well, you don't act like it. You became the swan, and you left me right in the duck pond. Polly! Yeah, forget it. There's no room for me in your new life. Hey, Louise! Louise, come on. Let's start! Louise. Louise. What? I prepared you a wholesome breakfast. Your morning paper. I took the liberty of ironing your homework. Well, thank you, Richard. Richie's cleaned everything up. Even straightened out the refrigerator shelves. Do you think he's on drugs? What? We want Louise! We want Louise! We want Louise! We want Louise! We want Louise! Thought you might come out this way. Come on. Hop in. So, it's tough being the most popular girl, huh? Well, I thought it would make me happy. And it didn't? Well, yeah, for a while. And, no, it didn't last. I know what you mean. You know, sometimes I wonder who my real friends are. I've been football team captain since the sixth grade. What happens when I go to college next year and I have to start all over? It doesn't matter. How do you know? Brad, you have a lot of fine qualities that have nothing to do with football. You think so? I know so. Louise, I want you to go to the dance with me. Really? Yeah. What can I say? You're an amazing girl, Louise. I've never met anyone quite like you. What, is that good? Is that good? That's great. Look, you're not phony. You don't play games with people to make them like you more. That's really important to me, and... Brad, I just... Let me finish. You're honest, and I respect you for that. No. No. This is a bad idea. I can't go to the dance wyou. Why? Because there's just something you don't know about me. I know everything I need to know. No, you don't. Look, why don't you just go to the dance with Randa? Forget Randa. I want to go with you. It's only natural. But it's not natural. Look, there are just some things you don't understand about all this, okay? Look, Louise, this is really stupid. I can't go to the dance with you. Don't ask me why. I gotta go. Louise! Oh, Louise. It's gorgeous. It's perfect. You shouldn't have. You're an artist. What an eye for detail! Serena, listen, you've got to help me. Look... I sat up all night trying to figure out a way to reverse the spell, and I can't find anything in this whole book. What do you mean reverse the spells? I mean make it go back the way it was. I just want everything and everyone to go back the way it was. Reverse? Now that I have all this? Absolutely not! Serena! Louise, everyone loves and listens to you, right? Yeah. They agree with me before I even finish what I'm saying. Picky, picky. You don't know what a luxury it is to have people agree with you. I'm not happy, okay? Who is happy? You'll get used to it. Believe me. You're going to knock 'em dead at the dance. You want to give that up? I just... I want to be me. I mean, all this stuff is happening, but it just... I don't know. It just doesn't feel like it's happening to me. Let's give it a shot for a couple of years, and then make a decision. Come on, Serena. Help me. Please? Come here. Sit down. All right. It's lonely. I know. I had to make people like me. You never knew how people felt? I didn't want to take the chance. So I can change it all, huh? The real magic... Is believing in yourself. If you can do that, you can make anything happen. Thank you. My dad got me into Stanford. He's a Stanford man. Yeah? I want to go Vidal Sassoon, but my mother's making me go to Malcolm Junior college. I got into SF State and Brad's going to visit me every weekend, aren't you, honey? So, did your dad get you the car? No. He got me a Schwinn. Can you believe it? It's like I'm cursed! You know, it could've been worse. You could've been here with that. I don't know. All right, guys.
