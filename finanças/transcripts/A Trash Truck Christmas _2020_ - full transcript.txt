Aw! Honk! Honk! Trash Truck! Yay! Let's go! Whoo-hoo! Come on! Hey hey! They're here! Hi, Trash Truck. Hey, guys! - Hey, Hank. - Hello, boys! Oh, we're gonna have some fun today! Yeah. A Trash Truck Christmas. - Are we done yet? - Almost. Just a few more. Santa won’t come if the lights are not up. Don’t worry. It’ll all be ready in time for tonight. Hi, Trash Truck! Dad, can I go play? - Sure. - Whoo-hoo! Hey, Trash Truck, are you excited for tomorrow? Hmm? Um… Really? ‘Cause I’m super excited. Well, you know, ‘cause tomorrow’s Christmas. Uh… What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You know what Christmas is, right? Mmm… Mm-mm. What? Trash Truck, it’s like the amazingest day of the whole year! Hmm? What about Donny and Walter and Ms. Mona? Do they know what tomorrow is? Hmm, what is tomorrow? - Huh. - Mmm… - Trash Day? - Laundry day? The day after today? Oh, oh. It’s yesterday! Wait, tomorrow. You guys! It’s Christmas Day! Oh! I must say, this is a new one for me. Oh, no. This is worse than I thought. I gotta get you guys up to speed. Okay. So, this is Christmas. Hmm, yes, hmm… - Okay… - That’s Santa Claus! He brings presents to everyone on Christmas Eve. Whoa, wait. Hold on. Slow down. This guy goes around and gives presents for no reason? Yeah! Isn’t that amazing? Look! He flies from rooftop to rooftop! Whoosh! Whoosh! No, it’s true! Pssh… Come on, Hank. Huh… But how do these little mooses fly? Oh! Those are called reindeer, and, um, I think Santa uses some magic dust or something. - Oh, I see. - Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Then he drops down the chimney and leaves presents! Like this backpack. Wow! He got me this last Christmas! How generous. Nice. But… why does he do it? Um… Aw, who cares why? Ho... How do we get Santa to visit us? Oh, he keeps track of all the good things you do. And he’ll come if you’re on his nice list. Has everybody been nice this year? Oh, yes. Well, there was a toad that I may have scolded a little. Oh, but he was a troublemaker. Other than that, I think I’ve been nice. Oh, Hank! I’ve been so naughty! I was the one who knocked over your trash cans last week. I was starving, and I... Walter, you already told me that. That doesn’t count. Oh. Okay, awesome. Nah, that was an accident. It doesn’t really count. - Donny? - Huh? Okay, where do I begin? Uh, guess we’ll start from January last year. It was a cold day. I was looking for a warm place to nap… You guys ever tasted a crayon? The blue does not taste like blueberry… The door was unlocked, so naturally I had to go in, and I was standing… I looked it in the eye and said "You better not poke me…" And lastly, that brings us to this morning. I rolled in something brown. I don’t know what is was. Do you guys wanna smell it? I kept a piece. Good heavens, Donny. I don’t know if all those things are bad. I mean, I think it’s more like… raccoon stuff. Yeah! That’s what I’m sayin'. I’m just bein' me. - Donny… - Oh, really? What? It’s true! Okay, well, I think you’re all on the nice list. Oh, goody, goody, goody, goody! So… now we get the presents! Huh? Not yet. Hmm? Santa won’t visit if we don’t have decorations up. We have to make the Tree Fort look like this! It’s gonna be a lot of work, but I know we can do it! - Then we’ll get the presents? - Uh-huh. Anything we want? You better believe it! - Presents! - Yes! Let’s get to it. Okay, Trash Truck, you get the Christmas tree. Mm-hm. Everyone else, spread out and find decorations. "Christmas," on three. One, two, three. Christmas! - Yeah! - Yeah! It’s so heavy! Yeah! Maybe something bigger… Oh. Uh-huh? That’ll make a great tree! Yeah. That is nice. Ahh! - Ah, I got it. - Yeah! Hmm? Hmm. Ah! Ah! Tsk-tsk-tsk. - Whoa! - Nice! - Oh, gimme, please, gimme! - These are for Santa! - Aww! - Busted. Yes! Look out, here it comes. Wow. - Whoo-hoo! - Bravo, yes! Yes! I did it! Oh, yeah, this feels Christmas-y! Well done, boys! The acorns were a nice touch, Ms. Mona. Why, thank you, Donny. But I think my favorite is the trash tree. - Yeah, it’s perfect! - Mm-hmm. - Oh, yeah, one last thing! - Hmm? The most important part. We need to write down a list of all the things you want for Christmas, so Santa will know what to bring you. Hmm. Hmm? Eh-eh-eh-eh! No peeking! Okay, you guys done? - My list is done! - Thank you. - Done. - Thank you. - You asked for garbage too? - Hank, love. Oh, boomerang, cool. Good list. All right, I think that’s it! Whoo-hoo! So, Santa will come tonight, right? Well, let’s make sure we didn’t forget anything. Hmm. And on Christmas Eve, after all the stockings had been hung… The decorations were twinkling… and the Christmas tree was glowing. Santa flew his sleigh from the North Pole and delivered presents to all the little boys and girls. The end. Um… and bears and raccoons and rats and trash trucks, right? I guess they forgot to put that in the book. Right, Hank? Um, I don't know. Whoa, whoa, what? Aww, that little raccoon doesn’t have a present. Donny, don’t worry. I’ll share my presents with you. Walt, you’re not a kid. You’re a bear. That means we get nothing. And Santa probably doesn’t come for trash trucks either. So there's no Christmas for us? It doesn't look like it. Well, this whole Santa thing sounded pretty fishy to begin with. A guy flying around in a sleigh delivering presents for no reason? No, he’s real. I promise! Well, maybe you could ask Santa to visit us? Um, well… - I never actually met him before. - What? Oh… Yeah, well, I'm gonna get my sock back. Sorry, Hank. It's okay, Hank. It certainly was a nice thought. Trash Truck, you believe me, right? Mmm… Mm-hmm. Santa’s real. I just wish I could show you. Oh, no! No, no, no! Now he's never gonna come. Huh? What was that? Did you guys see that? Oh, dear! Maybe it was a meteor. Or a spaceship! Or a balloon. Hmm? A big balloon. It went down over there! Huh? - Hmm… - Whoa. What are all these things? Candy canes? Hmm… Whoa, whoa, wow. Wow. - Come on, guys! - There’s so many! Oh, well, hello… Mm… Ooh! Aww! Where did all the candy canes go? What’s that sound? It’s coming from over there. It’s jingle-y. Hm. Oh! Wait for me, wait for me! Little mooses! From the story! A present! - Whoa! - Donny, we don’t know who that belongs to. No, no! Finders-keepers! Ho! Okay-kay-kay-kay… Oh, you found it, thank you! I don’t know what I’d do if I lost one. Joshua will be very happy you found this. Santa Claus! Is that really you? It certainly is. And you’re Hank, right? Oh, yeah. He knows your name? See? I told you he’s real. And these are my friends. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Santa. H-hi. Hello, I'm Santa. Hi, I’m Santa. I mean, I’m Walter. - So nice to meet you. - Oh, my! - I'm Santa. - Oh! Hmm… Say, big fella. Would you mind giving me a hand? Okay, great! I’ve got a bit of a problem over here. And a one… and a two… and a three! Wow! Now, let’s have a look at what happened here. Oh, boy, there it is. I think I can fix... Or not. That’s, uh, that’s not good. I was worried this might happen. What would, Santa? Well, this Christmas there were more good boys and girls than ever before. And that meant more presents than ever before. Wow! But all those presents were too heavy for the old sleigh to carry. And we crash-landed here. - Oh, no. - Oh, man. That’s not even the worst part. Now I can’t deliver any of these gifts. That’s awful. So… nobody’s getting presents? I’m afraid not. I’m sorry. I just don’t know what to do. This is the first time I’m going to miss Christmas. Oh, dear. - Santa, maybe we can help! - Mm-hmm. That’s very kind, but without my sleigh, there’s no way to deliver all these presents before Christmas morning. A new sleigh. It would have to be… A huge sleigh! Oh, yes. Very big. And strong enough to carry all the presents. - Absolutely. - And it would need lights? Yes, but I don’t know where I’m going to get a sleigh like that. Santa, I think I know someone that can help you. You do? Who? It’s…Trash Truck! Hmm? He would make the best sleigh for you. He can carry anything. He’s super strong. And he knows where everyone in town lives! Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes, of course! Trash Truck, you’re perfect! Nice strong arms… sturdy tires… and how about lights? Oh ho ho! That's a bright light, all right. Trash Truck, would you be my sleigh tonight? Um, is that a yes? Yeah! Yay! Well, what are we waiting for? - Whoopee! Yeah! - I'm so excited! Hmm… Wow. Hmm. The reindeer may need some help. Whoa! Hi, guys, I’m Walter. This is Donny here. - Hey! - I’m just so excited! - Be cool, Walter. - Oh, ho ho. I hope this works. Ho ho ho! Let’s go! Come on, Walter and Donny, pull! So heavy. Uh… Better get…. some good… presents…from this. This might take a while. Oh! I got so excited I almost forgot. Whoa. Oh, it’s so beautiful! Wow! Magic dust. Now, hang on, you guys! Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen! On, Donny. On, Walter! On, Trash Truck as well! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all! Oh ho ho ho! This is awesome! I can’t believe this is happening! Yeah! Higher! Go higher! Whoa, Trash Truck, this is amazing! Ho ho ho! Well done, everyone. - We did it! - Yeah! - That’s our Tree Fort, Santa! - What splendid decorations! I’d never miss that! All right, Ms. Mona, who’s first on the list? That would be Hajoon. To Hajoon’s house! Ah, ah, ahh! Ahh! I can't see! - Oh, my! - Almost there! Oh, wow! Wow, wow, wow! Whoa! Look, it’s the movie theater! Oh, and there’s Grandpa’s plane! All right, let's find a good spot to land. Yeah! What a landing, Trash Truck! To be honest, I thought we’d just use the driveway! Hajoon’s present is to the left of the blue present. Don’t forget about his brother Noah’s gift. The one with the sparkly ribbon. Here they are! Thank you. [Mm-hmm. Ho ho ho ho ho! Wow! Awesome! Cookies? How did I not know about this holiday? There’s a lot more where that came from. - This is gonna be a good night. - Mmm! That was so cool. Giving gifts is my favorite part about Christmas. What? That’s your favorite part? Over everything? Oh, yes. It makes people happy. And I like seeing people happy. Huh. Yeah. Who’s next on the list, Ms. Mona? That would be… Newton and Rosalind. And away we go! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hm. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ahh! - Here it is! - Thanks, Ms. Mona! Trash Truck! Here! Mm-hmm. Just a minute. Wait, Santa! Yeah! Hmm… All right, last stop, Lena's house. Yeah! This is it! The last gift. Oh, no! What's the matter, Santa? This isn’t Lena’s gift. It’s yours. What? But this is the last one. Lena’s must’ve fallen when I crash-landed. I can’t believe it. I’ve never lost a gift before. Good heavens. Hmm. I want her to have my present, Santa. Wha... Huh? Oh, Hank, I can’t ask you to do that. That's okay. This was already the best Christmas ever. Well, since this is from you, maybe you’d like to deliver it. Really? Wow! Absolutely. Oh, and you’ll need this. Whoa! Oooh! Yeah! Yeah! Here I go. Whoo-hoo! Mm. Thanks, Santa Hank. Couldn't have done it better myself. Why don't you do the honors? Really? Whoo-hoo! Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Ho ho ho, nice take-off, Hank! Well, we did it, everyone. - Oh ho. - Yeah! Yes! Okay. Now, let's have some fun. - Ho ho! - Hyah! Whoa-oa! Ah! Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah! Ho ho! Whee! Hyah! To the sky! Ahh! Wow! Hyah! Ho ho ho! Whoo-hoo! Whoa-oa-oa…! Ho ho ho! That was some flying. Simply magical. Did you see how fast I was? I might be part reindeer. Yeah! Me too. Wow, who’da thought? A trash truck for a sleigh. Yeah, thank you, Santa. No, I should be the one saying thank you. You saved Christmas. Aw, shucks. Aww. Oh, I do hope your sleigh holds up for the trip home. It’s caused quite a bit of trouble for you. You know what? I’m glad it broke. If that hadn’t happened, I wouldn’t have met you all. Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Santa! Wow! It’s Christmas! Ooh! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Olive. Santa brought presents! Ooh! - Merry Christmas, Hank. - Why don’t you open up your gifts? Oh, yeah! Huh? Hmm. - Uh… - Where'd that come from? It’s a letter from Santa! Wow! - I gotta go to the Tree Fort! - Okay. "Dear Hank, Meeting you and your friends last night was the best Christmas gift I’ve ever gotten. Donny is a special little guy, even if he might have trouble staying on the nice list." Oh! Walter! Wake up! "And Walter is about as nice as a real life teddy bear." Wake up! "I can see why you are friends." Huh? Look! "Ms. Mona is simply charming. Oh! I think Mrs. Claus would like to meet her and get her cookie recipe. I can’t wait to visit you and your friends again next year… especially Trash Truck! Now that is one awesome truck! I might even need his help again. What a lucky boy you are to have such good friends." Trash Truck! "And how lucky they are to have you." - Hi, guys! - Hey, Hank! Trash Truck! Did he come? Did Santa come? - He came! - So many presents! Look what Santa got me! What’d you get, Trash Truck? No way! I got the same thing! What about you guys? Mm-mm! Cheese Puffs! Aw, now that is some good garbage! Just a lovely handbag, a new camera… and this! Whoa! - Hey, Hank! - Hi! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! - Hi, Walter, Trash Truck! - It looks amazing! What did Santa get you? "Hank, I want to wish you a very Merry Christmas." Hey, Dad! Look! Wow! Check this out! Open it up, Walter. Unbelievable!
