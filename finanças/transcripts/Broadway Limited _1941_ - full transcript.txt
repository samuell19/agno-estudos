What we want to know now is when does the next picture start? That's the main thing. Oh, that's adorable. Now, wait a minute, boys, we must... - Just a minute! - Enough! But you told us to come up and... Mr. Ivanski! I'm sorry I made a mistake. I am entitled to change my mind. - Am I not? - I know, boys. I'm very sorry. - But you definitely told us... - Yes, I know. I'm very sorry. Some other time. Thank you. What's the matter? Listen, darling. Listen to me. We made great pictures together. Terrific successes. But now I'm looking in to the future. We must go on to better things. You can't top umph with umph. Well, what do you mean? Oh, in our next picture there is no one connected with it. The girl must have a soul. She must be deep, sincere. And how do you get that? I have decided. You have got to have a baby. A baby? I have to have a... Exactly. This is the only thing. Believe me, my darling. There is nothing so beautiful, so fundamental... Now, wait a minute, Ivan. Please. I've done everything you wanted me to for two years. I've posed in bathing suits in the middle of December. I've ridden wild horses. I've collected Russian wolf hounds. And I've even been the sweetheart of the Orange Grower's Association but I'm telling you right now, Ivan, I'm not going to have a baby. You will! I will not. Make up your mind. My mind's made up. - And that's that. - Very well. Very well. The end has begun. You no longer trust in me. Then this is goodbye. I go. But you will have a baby. Uh, Miss Riley? Yes, Mr. Ivanski? We have got to get a baby. But definitely, what's more important, we've got to get it by train time. This is ridiculous. There must be a way. What a predicament. Baby. I got it. You get it! Where am I going to get a baby in Chicago? And what kind of a lug do you think I'm... lug. Lug! I think I've got it. You know a baby? Yeah. He's 6' 2". - Can't use him. - Quiet. Please. Hello, operator? Get me the Roundhouse Cafe. He's an old boyfriend of mine who works on the Pennsylvania Railroad. And if he's not married or dead, he's a cinch to help us. Hello? Is Mr. Maurice Monaghan there? Just a minute. Oh, Mike? What do you want? Excuse me. Sorry. Telephone, Mike. Is it important? I don't know. Who is it? A dame. A dame? Yeah. Like I always said, dames is poison. Hello? Who? Oh, hello. When did you get in? Oh, I just this second took off my hat. Oh, no. We're leaving this afternoon on the Broadway Limited. On the Limited? Why, that's my train! I'm the engineer. Oh, that's wonderful. Oh, Maurice, darling, would you do me a little favor? Oh, anything for you, honey. You know that. Why, I'd give you my arm right up to there. You've got to have a baby? You what? Oh. For a press stunt to go to New York? And you want me to get it? Oh, thanks, darling. I knew you wouldn't let me down. And just one more thing. We must have it by train time. That ain't for a couple of hours yet. Sure, sure. That gives me plenty of time. I'll see you later. Goodbye. Baby. How am I going to... Who do I know? Can I get you something? Yeah. Get me a baby. A baby? I mean a cup of coffee. Lou, you haven't got a baby, have you? I ain't even married. Why? Well, a friend of mine wants to get hold of one to take to New York for a press stunt. There's $500 in it. I know a baby about 18 who would like to take a trip to New York. Say, bud, what's this gag about the baby? It ain't a gag. It's for a friend of mine. She's a press agent for a movie star. She's the movie star that wants a kid. Oh, and so they're going to take it to New York, huh? Yeah. And like I say, there's $500 in it. That's a lot of money. Stick around a minute. I think I can help you. Hey, who is that mug? Who knows. I never saw him before. - Anything else? - Yeah. Give me another coffee. Coming right up. - Say, you must like coffee. - I do. But I wouldn't drink so much hot water just to get a little. Say here, Mr. Monaghan... Take her easy. OK, buddy. I got just what you're looking for. Come on. Let's take a walk. Swell. How much do I owe you? Save it. Thanks. Gee, if you can get me out of this gem, I'll be a friend of yours for life right up to here. You haven't got a thing to worry about. Everything is taken care of nice and pretty. Union Station. Yes, sir. Oh, he's beautiful. Wonderful! Superb! This will give you what you need. Not that jitterbug kind of love of umph business. Visualize yourself in your own little bungalow before your flickering fireplace. Your little baby in your arms. Your young husband by your side. This is the love of real people. Honest. Sincere. Down to earth. Believe me, my darling. This is basic. Fundamental. The life nations are built on! Thank you, very much! One more, please! Could you hold him this way? Soft smile. With warmth. That's enough, gentlemen. That's enough. Thank you very much. Well, there you are. OK. Thanks. Lots of luck. Please, gentlemen. Please. Miss Tremaine is tired! What are you going to New York for this trip, Miss Tremaine? Oh, it's just the usual thing. You know, a little vacation before her next film. How about it, Miss Tremaine? Thank you very much, gentlemen. We'll be seeing you. As I said before. I love your fair city. Chicago, adieu. Hold it, Mr. Ivanski! Thank you very much! All aboard! You'll be on your own after we hit Fort Wayne. What do you mean? I ain't going back with you. I'm going through. Yeah? Through to where? New York. How come? I'm taking my vacation. What train are you going out on? What do you mean? I'm going to arrive right here on this - train. You can't dead head on the Limited. Who is dead headed? I've got a ticket and my girl is on this train. You're what? Am I supposed to take that as a crack? I said my gal, and she's from Hollywood. It ain't Garbo, is it? No, it ain't Garbo. I don't go for blondes. - Pardon me. - Certainly. Oh, oh. Well, maybe if I went back the other... No, if you just... if you... It's perfectly all right. If you just wait a minute. I don't know how... If you would... Well, I guess, you can't... Thank you lady very much. You're welcome. Wilbur, this is no place to play ball. Why not? I'm so sorry. That's all right. Pardon me. Oh, janitor. Do you see many motion pictures? Yes'm, whenever I can. - Did you see "The Scarlet Lady?" - Yes'm. Do you remember who was the star in it? Yes'm. Miss April Tremaine. The umph girl. She's on this train, isn't she? Yes, ma'am. She sure is. Right in there. Oh, thank you so much. What a small world this is. - Thank you. - Yes. Oh! Why, Miss Prottle! Well, you had us a little worried. We thought possibly you'd missed the train. Oh, no. I wanted to catch a train all my life and finally did. Is Miss Tremaine... Yes, she's being prettied up. By the way, have you met Mr. Ivanski yet? Oh, no. But I'd like to. Well, believe it or not he can't wait to meet you. - Oh, really? - Oh, Patsy! Oh, just a moment. Look, Miss Prottle, this is Mr. Ivanski's compartment. You just go in and take a seat and I won't be a minute. Oh, well, thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. - So? - Oh, excuse me. She told me... Excuse you? I don't even know who you are. - I'm... - Nevermind. Why should I care who you are? Get out! Oh, dear. But I'm Miss Prottle. Prottle-wottle-bottle. What do I care? Get out! Please get out! I never... Out! Thank you. Oh, dear. I never. Oh, Miss Prottle. Oh, I'm so sorry I had to leave you. But you should have gone right in. - Oh, that's all right. - Oh, no. You simply must meet Mr. Ivanski. Why, he'd never forgive me if you didn't. Oh, but I... Now, please, go ahead. Oh, but I was just in here! Oh, he won't mind a bit. Now you just sit right down there and make yourself comfortable. I wonder where he went. Oh, I'll have a quick look and be back in a jiffy. That's all right. Why do you make my life miserable? Why are you haunting me? Get out again. Out! Please! Oh, there you are. Oh, I see you two have met. I have met nobody. This woman... Yes, this is Miss Prottle. You remember? The president of the Chicago April Tremaine club. - No. - Yeah. - Not the Miss Prottle. - Uh huh. That's impossible. This lovely young creature. Oh, it's impossible. Oh, that isn't all. She's going to write the story of this trip for the Chicago Post. You know, a sort of my day by Myra Prottle. Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. But why doesn't somebody told me those things. Miss Prottle, a thousand pardons. How will you ever forgive me? How will you ever forgive that woman? Who? Me? But it wasn't her fault. You see... Such generosity. Such big heartedness. Get out. Go, go, go before I lose my temper. All right. All right. I'm sorry. Oh, Miss Prottle, when you want to change your scenery, you're with me in compartment A just down the hall. Go, go, go, go, go. Miss Prottle. Prottle. What a lovely name. Oh, do you like it? Please sit down. Please. What's the matter now? That's the trouble. I don't know. How do you turn him off? I don't know, too. I never turned off one in my life. Poor old dear. - Say, maybe he's hungry. - Could be. Well, you take care of him for a minute, will you? I'll see what I can find. Next time your baby cries, William, give him some of this. Ought to fix him up. Yes, sir, doctor. Thank you, sir. May I have a glass of milk, please? Yes, ma'am. Might I have your autograph? Why, Harvey! Sure. Remember me? The man that used to breathe down the back of your neck during math class? You mean the short fat one with the curly hair? That's the same one. How are you, Mary? I'm fine, Harv, but... Come on. Let's sit down. I want to take a good look at you. Well, I might let you have a little peek. Tell me, Harv. How's the doctor business? Picking up. Appendix here. A tonsil there. It all adds up. I see. Why didn't you ever write to me? You know how it is. Well, after all, you're the famous April Tremaine. And me, I'm just a struggling young doctor with too much future and not enough present. You know, just plain folks. And what difference does that make? Hey, what are you doing whipping up a 9 course dinner? Oh, dear. The baby. - I forgot! - The baby? Yeah. Come on. Maybe you can help. What's the matter with her? Well, you're the doctor. Why, Patsy, do you feel all right? Not anymore I don't. Well, what are you doing that for? Every time I quit he howls. Oh! See? Here. Let me have him. Come on, fella. This is Dr. North. Dr. North? Oh, how do you do? How do you do? I... pardon me. Certainly. ...is that the fella you were telling me about? That's the one. He's kind of cute, isn't he? Oh, I think so. Still go for him? Oh, Patsy. And how. You know... You know what? Well, I think Ivan has something there. Home. Babies. Young husband. Yeah. Did you say husband? Uh huh. That's what I thought you said. Well, excuse me. I got... Excuse me. That is... I, uh, well, excuse me. Excuse me. Oh, Mr. Ivanski, really? Come in. And then in the third reel, he gives her a kiss. Deep, with warmth, with feeling. A kiss like only I, Ivan Makail Ivanski can direct. Well, what do you want? I have to see you. It's very important. There's nothing so important as my art. Oh, yes there is. April. April? Will you excuse me? We'll resume later where we left of. - Yes, I have to tidy up. - Yes. - You go tidy up. - Such generosity. Come on. So what's with April? Did you know that she's got a boyfriend? So what? Some of the best people have boyfriends. I forgive her. - Did you say boyfriend? - Yes. The one she almost married before you came along. Stop worrying. I pushed him out of her life. Well somebody's pushed him back in again. And if you're interested, he's in there with him now. Impossible. He's in there? Yes. And that isn't all. You remember all that stuff you told her in the taxi about a home and babies and a young husband. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So what? Well, she's beginning to believe you. Believe me? Nonsense. She can't do that to me. What right has he got to be in there. Think of my next picture. Think of my pride. If I were you, I'd start thinking about my pocket book. What's with the pocket book? What's that got to do with it? Well, maybe I'm wrong. But if she happens to marry the guy, you wouldn't have any star to direct? You mean, you think it's possible? Mm, could be. Fantastic. I've heard enough. We've got to get him out but definitely. Come on! This time I'll do it. And when I do it I've done it. Just think what we've been missing all these years. Uh huh. Come on, darling. Just once more. Oh, Harvey, isn't it wonderful? It sure is. It's a... Well, I wish his mother would come by. Oh, that wasn't his mother. Oh, wasn't it? Hey, you know something? He's got eyes just like yours. You think so? Uh huh. Say, whose baby is this? Oh, I don't know. It's just a press stunt. Press stunt? Yeah. Publicity gag. What's the matter? Don't you believe me? Well, I don't know what to believe. Well, he even looks like you. Now, wait a minute. This isn't my idea. Mr. Ivanski thought it up. It's just a gag. A gag? Yes. Well, now look, honey. Let's just start all over again. Now, tell me the truth. Hello, darling. And how do you feel after your strenuous day. Well, here is somebody that will tell you the truth. Ivan, this is Dr. North. - Pleasure. - How do you do. I just told Dr. North that this baby is a publicity stunt. He doesn't seem to believe me. Publicity stunt? Well, now, my darling, after all you have put me in a very embarrassing position. Why... why this is ridiculous! No, no, no. Please don't excite yourself. Oh, a publicity stunt, eh? If you don't mind, I'll go back and finish my drink. Why, I never heard of such a thing. Now, believe me, darling. This is for your own good. But positively one day you'll thank me. I'll thank you right now to get out of my life. And stay out! Well, - is saved. I did it again. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must relax. Here. Here, you double crosser. This was your idea and now you take care of it! Well, start relaxing. What do you say? Oh, never mind. ...on top. ...on top, Blitz 43. Right on the nose. Guard limit. Oh, when you get back to Chicago, throw this in my locker. OK, Romeo. That's me. See you in a couple of weeks. Take it easy. Hey, you might need your other shirt. Hey, ain't you getting kind of fancy there. I'm on the dirt for a couple of weeks. I'm riding through to New York. With his girl. With his what? My gal. Do you want to make something of it? All aboard! Hey, all aboard. There you are, sir. Hey. This is swell. Menu, sir? I'll order later. I'm waiting for a lady. Yes, sir. Class. Hi. Hello, sonny. What's your name? Beat it, will you? Beat it. Come along, Wilbur. Is this satisfactory, sir? This will be fine, thanks. Sorry. Ivan has pushed me around for the last time. Nix. Nix. You want to cut your own throat? Remember Prottle. Oh, isn't this lovely? Oh, lovely isn't the word. Pardon me. Look, Harvey, you're being absolutely childish. I don't see what's childish about it. I just don't like being fooled, that's all. - Pardon me. - But I'm not trying to fool you. There's two schools of thought on that subject. Listen, Harvey, I told you what this was. - What else can I do? - Would you mind... You might try telling the truth for a change. But I have told you the truth. OK. That's your story. You stick to it. Listen, would you mind letting me out of this argument? Well, go ahead. Go ahead. Who is stopping you? Let's just forget the whole thing. I don't want to forget it. I'm not the baby's mother! I'm not the mother. I told you that a dozen times. Now won't you believe me? No. All right. Have it your way. I am the mother. Now are you happy? No. Who's the father? Oh, you make so... he is. Good evening, Mr. Ivanski. My friends are over there. Hello, darling. Hello, darling. Why, I'll darling you... Ah, ah. It's a baby. I'll take care you later. I'll knock those store teeth right down your throat. So what's with him? Oh, he's a little bit upset. You know, you told him I was the baby's mother. Mm-hm. Well, I told him you were the father. Me the father? Mm-hm. Aye, aye, aye. Excuse me. I'm going to my room. Contact me in New York. Would you care to order, Mr. Ivanski? - I'm not hungry. - Anything wrong? Nothing is wrong. Everything is wrong. Well, I guess we took care of him, didn't we? He's going to knock my teeth down my throat. Where is that porter? My store teeth down my throat. I'd like to him do... Where is that porter? Who is it? It's the porter, sir. You must stop this train. I'm getting out. Sir? I'm getting out. Stop the train. But this thing don't stop no more until we get down to... Oh, listen. Listen. For a red light you will stop the train, don't you? Well, yes, sir. Well, ain't I as important as a red light? - I guess so. - Well? Well, maybe I better talk to a conductor about this. - Well, commence. - Yes, sir. - Commence. - Yes, sir. Pardon me. Who is it? This is Dr. North. I want to see you. He ain't in. Besides, he's very sick. I said I want to see you. Open this door. I'll tell him when he comes back. If you don't open this door, I'm going to break it in. It won't be necessary. Can't you see I'm coming? Don't strike me. It's about time you and I had a little talk. Talk? Certainly. Besides, I have something to tell you, too. Come in. There's something I want to tell you, too. Please, me first. Now, I, Ivan Mikail Ivanski will tell you the truth. And this is official. I am the one which arranged it. Just what I heard. No, no, no, no. No, you don't understand. I am not the baby's father and she is not the baby's mother. But what... For publicity for her next picture. Oh. Oh, I guess I've been an awful sap. No question about it. Did somebody want to get off this train? Get off? Now, who would want to get off a beautiful train like this? Thank you very much, Mr. Conductor. Thank you very kindly. See you later. Thank you. Nice fella. But how did you know there was a fake car on the track. Because I looked out the window and saw a paddle. A paddle? A paddle is a light signal. A light signal? Why didn't you say so? Hey, Jerry! That was Jerry Mulligan driving the 21. I don't think he saw me. He probably heard you. I don't think he could have. Do you? Look, Miss Prottle, let's go and see if we can help April with the baby. Oh, dear, yes. I just love babies. You must tell me more about the railroad business. There ain't any more. Look, come along, dear. Come. I'll see you in the observation car later. Yes, but put that - to bed first, will you? I think you got something there. This seat is reserved. Yes, sir. Do you wish to order. Oh, I'll take care of that later. I'm waiting for a lady. Yes, sir. Hey, buddy. Buddy. How did Notre Dame come out? They won. What score? 6 to nothing. Who made the touchdown? Here. You take it. I'll lay odds that it won't take long to get the guy that pulled that snatch. Huh? The Pierson kidnappers. Oh. Has mole in the left shoulder, blonde hair, blue eyes, believed heading east. You know, the last snatch case they had in Chicago they got the guy in three weeks. They hung him. They gave 177 years to his accomplice. His what? His accomplice. You know, the guy that helped him. Of course he said he was just driving the car and didn't know that the kid was hot. But they made it stick. And they'll bring in this mob, too. 177 years. Yeah. Oh, you got a match? No thanks. I don't smoke. Oh, come in. - Say, Patsy, I was wondering... - Shh. Uh, well, we'll be running along now Miss Prottle. You must be tired. Oh, no. It's only three minutes to 9:00. What time do you get tired. I never do until I've heard "Renfrew of the Mounted." He's on the radio at 9 o'clock. I haven't missed him in 47 weeks. Well, lady, there's a swell radio in the cocktail lounge. Oh, yeah. Oh, but I couldn't go there alone with all those men. Well, she can go with you. Yeah... Oh, that would be lovely. Oh, yes. I've always wanted to meet Renfrew. Well, hurry. We've only got one minute. Yeah. But somebody has got to take care of the baby. I'll take care of him. - Say, what about our date? - Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Have a good time. Have a good time? With the... That's right. Kind of a cute kid, ain't he? I was just trying to cover him up. So I noticed. If you need any help I'll be right out here. It's Renfrew. Oh, thank goodness. You're right. It is Renfrew. Stand where you are, Jack Dalton. And you'd better reach for the sky. No, you don't, Renfrew. I've been saving this 0.45 slug just for you. Oh, Renfrew, are you hurt? Never touched me. Oh, Renfrew, darling. You've saved me from a fate too horrible to think about. I don't know how to reward you. Ridding the country of a skunk like that is reward enough, Melinda. But surely... That and the soft light I see dancing in your eyes. Renfrew, darling, you may kiss me. Will Renfrew kiss Melinda? Listen in at the same time tomorrow night, ladies and gentlemen, for the further adventures of Renfrew the Mounted, presented each weekday evening by the makers of... Do you think he'll kiss her. I really don't know. Honest, I don't. Well, we'll know tomorrow night anyway. I can hardly wait. Say, what are you doing here? The baby. Is it all right? That's what I've come to tell you about. You mean you walked out on him? Well, I'll take care of him. I really ought to go to bed anyway. Oh, I wouldn't think of it, Miss Prottle. Good night. Thanks. Say, what are you doing? I was just thinking. Do you always perspire when you think? No, no, no. Pat, look, it's about that kid. Ah, you were a sweetheart to get that baby for us. You know, I think I'm beginning to go for you. Yes, yes, yes. That's nice. That's swell. But the baby has a mole. What's that got to do with my going for you? Or aren't you interested? Sure I am. You know I am. I was reading in the papers. Oh, if you want to keep this conversation strictly impersonal, all right. Oh, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. I'm worried. About what? 177 years. What are you mumbling about? A guy don't live to be more than 60 or 70, does he? Well, how can he serve 177 years? For what? That's what I'm trying to tell you. And I've been trying to tell you something too, Mr. Monaghan. But if you're not in the mood, I guess you're not in the mood. - Good night! - Patsy! What do you want? Is that really your face? Excuse me, buddy. I left this. - Do you mind? - Ah, friendship is a wonderful thing. Now that we have a perfect understanding, you feel better and I feel better. Oh, sure, sure. - How about a drink? - No, no, no. Thank you. I don't drink after dinner. But don't let it stop you. - Oh, no. No, thanks. - I don't drink after dinner either. Excuse me. Mary. This is ridiculous. Oh, but listen, kiddo. - I've apologized. - Sure. Sure. You've apologized. Well, I don't know what I could have been thinking about. It's been so long that, well, just seeing you again has sort of... Pardon me if I seem to intrude. That's quite all right. I was leaving anyway. Oh, but, honey, please. - Oh, wait, Mary. - Now wait, my young friend. - We must have a talk. - Yeah, about what? About Miss Tremaine and you. Sit down, please. Sit down. Who are you? What do you mean who am I? Dr. Harvey North, that's who. And what does that mean? Well, I don't expect you to understand. But it means 10 years of study and sweat and sacrifice of working for humanity instead of for audiences. It means that some day I'm gonna have the finest clinic that science can dream up. A place where I can patch up youngsters - the way you patch up film. - Hm. Nice. That's very nice. And what would such clinic costs? $50,000, I could build a... Uh-hmm. And how much have you got now? If somebody would suddenly hand me $75, I'd have an even $100. So, you would ask her to give up her future, her career, for this silly thing you call love? Hmm? Would you do that to her? Believe me, my young friend. You two, it won't work. Oh, all right. All right. You don't have to blueprint it for me. I can figure it out for myself. Giving up a girl like that isn't so easy. - But I guess you're right. - When was I wrong? - She's not for me. - Believe me, my young friend. It is best you do not see her anymore. That will make it easier for her. You must stay out of her life but completely. Okay. You win. Good. We'll shake on that. One thing. Just don't you try any tricks. Me? With me, it's strictly business. Mm-hm. Thanks. Hey, what's the idea? - Red Cross. - Well, I'm not through with that yet. Oh, I beg your pardon. Pardon me. - Cigarette. - Uh-hmm. I was wondering if I could borrow your paper. Oh, sure. Help yourself. - Thanks. - Say, Mike, would you mind giving me a hand with my suitcase? - I can't get it open. - Why sure. Sure, I will. Thanks a lot, Mike. That was swell of you. Oh, that's all right. Any time at all. Oh, dear. Oh, please. Oh, you mustn't. Oh, not here. After all, I hardly know you. Oh, dear. Oh, please. Oh, well, if you insist. You may kiss me, Renfrew. Oh! Which way did he go? He went that way. Oh. I hardly know what to say. Oh, I know just how you feel. Confidentially, I'm that way about Donald Duck. - Really? - Mm-hm. Oh. - Well, it was so high up there... - Well, you come right in here. There's plenty of room. Beside, if Renfrew comes back, you won't have so far to fall. Well, that's right. - Yeah. - Well, thank you. - You're perfectly welcome. - Uh-hmm. I'm not used to sleeping alone. Back home, I always sleep with Richard. - Richard? - Yes, Richard is the cat. It's really a girl cat, but we always call it Richard. Oh, you do. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. I hope I'm not crowding the baby. Oh, no. Why, when I was his age we used to sleep 13 in a bed. Weren't you superstitious? No. We... Goodnight, Miss Prottle. Goodnight! Miss Prottle, would you please get rid of that bottle? Oh. Oh! Of course. Betsy? What do you want? I've got to talk to you. Shh! Shh. - Oh, Betsy... - Shh. Say, what's the matter? Have you got howl's blood in you? Why don't you go to bed? I can't sleep. It's about that baby. - It's hot. - What am I supposed to do? Stay up all night and fan it. Oh, it's not that kind of hot. It's been snatched. - Oh, stop... - Kidnapped. Oh, don't be... Are you telling me that you stole - that baby? - Not me. But I'm an accomplice. - Accomplice? - Yeah. Do you know what that means? Yeah. 177 years. Oh. Well, what are we gonna do about it? We? Include me out. Wait a minute. I think I've got an idea. - Really? - Yeah. - Good. - Shh. Here. You take it from here. But, Patsy! Shh! Shh. You don't want to get me in a jam, do you? Give me a break, will you? Please. Shh. Hey, how would you like t o hear the story about the three bears? Oh. Now we going somewheres. Well now, let me see. Once upon a time, there was three bears. A papa bear. A great big bear like that. And a mama bear about that size. And a teeny weeny little bear, well, about your size. Well, one day, they decided to go out for a little stroll. You know, just like bears always do. You understand, don't you? Sure. Well, little Goldilocks came along. Now there was a swell girl. She had everything. You know the kind of a girl I mean, don't you? Sure you do. Well, she spots this joint over there and she makes for it. What's the hitch, superintendent? There's a flat up the valley. We've got to get these gondolas up there in a hurry or the whole town will go out. That 1600 won't make it fast enough so I'm taking the kettle off the Limited. ...porridge. She ate it all up. And then she wanted to go upstairs. So she goes upstairs and, uh, she went to sleep. Hey, Mike! Come on, Mike! Open up! Listen, they're trying to stop and this is our chance to get the baby - back to its family. - How? Shh. I've got it all figured out. There you are. Oh, um, what are we stopping for, cap? We don't know yet, ma'am. Must be some trouble up ahead. Oh, I see. Well, uh, - how long we gonna be here? - Well, that's hard to say. The conductor has just gone up front now to find out. Goodbye, pumpkins. You'll be all right now. Everything's okay. Okay. That's what you think. I just heard from the sarge and we have to lay over here for two and a half hours. Lay over? But we can't. Yeah. But they don't know that. Maybe I'd better find out what the trouble is. I know what the trouble is. I want you to go see what you can do about it. Yeah. Yeah. Roll that call train as soon as you're ready. Say, super, is this on the level about us laying over for two hours and a half? Right. And that's figuring close, Monaghan. Well, why don't you run in on the 1600? What's that supposed to be, a gag? - There ain't a chance. - Why ain't there? That little boiler couldn't pull that due train in a million years. You couldn't get up enough head on that to haul the Limited around the block. Ah, you don't know what you're talking about. Give me fireman with a pair of arms and some shoulders and I'll show you what's what. What's the matter with you, Mulcahey? You used to be the best smoke agent that ever had this mountain run. Maybe you're a little too old and fat. What do you mean old and fat? I can still show you young guys a thing or two. I'll fire for you if that's all you're worrying about. Well, what are we waiting for? Come on. - Miss Riley? - Yeah? Monaghan says he'll see you in Harrisburg. He's taking the Limited in. He's taking it in? That's right. Say, there's a handy little fella - to have around the house. - Yes, ma'am. Okay. Here. Too big a load, I'm telling you. You're wasting your time. I'm gonna have a lot of time to waste if we don't get going soon. Fill her up, will you? I'd give it some sand. Too big a load, huh? 70, do you hear me? We made it 70. All right. All right. This for you. You're the only man on this line that knows enough about this kettle - to coax it through. - Coax it through? Well, we'll be on time if you don't pass out on me first. Come on. Come on. Fill her up. Fill her up. She's got a full head on her now. She'll blow her plate. So what? You're insured, ain't you? Where is everybody? Oh, there you are. Well, where's the baby? Baby? Baby! The baby! Oh, dear! Oh, Mr. Ivanski! We must do something! Please, please, Miss Prottle, this is no time. Yes, but the baby is gone. - Somebody has taken the baby. - Somebody has taken the baby? - Is something wrong? - Something wrong? What are you standing here for? Do something! You heard her. The baby's gone. - But where? - Where? When? How? What's the difference? I demand action. Go. Call the police quickly. I'll get a message off at the next station. - We pass there in a minute. - Oh, wait! Wait, nothing! Go! I demand action. - You don't understand. - Oh, this is dreadful. Oh, look, Miss Prottle, it's awfully late. Oh, but I'm not tired. Well, try and get tired. If it isn't something, it's something else. Wait! I have to talk to you. Talk, talk, talk. Tonight I sleep. - Tomorrow I talk. - Please, you must listen. That baby is hot. Why do I care about his temperature? Try and understand. Mike didn't know about it when he got the kid, but it had been kidnapped! - Snatched! - Aye, aye, aye. Kidnapped. Snatched? You mean... then why are you standing here for? Let's stop the conductor. Don't let him send for the police. Come on. What do you think I've been trying to tell you? Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. Mr. Conductor! Mr. Conductor! I thought it over. I changed my mind. Yeah. You what? We decided it's better we do not call the police. Yes, you know, Miss Tremaine being such a famous person as you know. Oh, well, it's too late. I just put the message off. Well, you don't understand. I'm telling you we do not want the police. And I'm telling you, you got them. They get on at Harrisburg. - Aye, aye, aye. - Oh, but they can't! Oh, please, what are we going to do? What are we going to do? It's terrific! - Sensational! - Is it? Ivan Mikail Ivanski saw the whole thing. That's fine. Saw what? Shh. - The baby is hot, no? - Yes. - Snatched, no? - Yes! Well, we haven't got it, so what are we worrying about? What are we wo... That's right! Say, how did you get in here? Why aren't you asleep? Will you please get Dr. North right away? Yes, ma'am. Come on. You better sit up and take these things off. We've got to make this thing look right. Is something the matter? Oh, Harvey, it isn't me. It's the baby. Well, there must be something wrong. He's... he's so wide awake. Well, I don't see anything wrong in that. But it's late. He should be asleep. Shouldn't he? Maybe he isn't tired. Babies are just like grown folks. They go to sleep. They wake up. Isn't that right? Oh, but... I'll stick around and make sure that he gets back to sleep. Oh, please don't close that. I had to call Mike in to open it for me. You mean that Mike came in here to open... Uh huh. Oh. What's the matter? Oh, nothing. Nothing. Everything is just dandy. It's a lovely bag. And don't you worry about the baby. He's gonna be fine. Oh, I'm so glad. Isn't it beautiful? Yeah. They all are. Gee, Harvey, I'd love to have a little fella just like that. Wouldn't you? Yes, of course. Anybody would. But on a staff doctor's salary? Why, Harvey, you think that would make any difference to him? No. Probably wouldn't make any difference to him. No, but I still think it would make a heck of a lot of difference to April Tremaine. Oh, listen, Harvey. I'm never going back to Hollywood again. I wanna be just plain Mary Potter, or Mrs. Jones, or... Mrs. Dr. North. Do you really mean that? Mary, you sure you know what you're talking about? I was never so sure of anything in my whole life. You come with me and I'll prove it to you. - But, honey, wait. - I have waited. I've waited for three years and that's much too long. Say, did I tell you that I love you? You know, I'm not quite sure. Maybe you better tell me again. - Hello. - Hello. No, no, no! You snake in the bush. You double crosser. You triple crosser. No, he's not... - I love him. - And I love her. Now, you figure out an answer for that. - It's impossible. - Oh, no it isn't. You were right, Ivan. And I'm very grateful to you for opening my eyes. I'm going to marry Harvey. - Marry? - Uh huh. I'm through with pictures. I'm never going back to Hollywood. You're quitting pictures? She's quitting pictures. No, no, darling. Listen, listen to me. Maybe you're tired. Maybe you're excited. Maybe you go to bed and in the morning - I'll settle everything. - Oh, I'm sorry, old timer. But, you see? It seems that we settled everything tonight. Toodle-oo. Toodle-oo? Aye, aye, aye, aye. May I come in? Now what do you want? My friend, last night you told me that if you had $50,000 you could build a great clinic. A place where you can do fine things for little children. Yes, and I also told you that I didn't have the $50,000. Exactly. You have the skill but you haven't got the money. I have the money but not the skill. - So, all together... - Yeah, I know. You put them all together and they spell magnolia. No, no, no. I, Ivan Ivanski, will give you the money. I'm going to build for you the finest clinic - that money can buy. - Now, look, who do you think - you're kidding? - Kidding? But I'm not kidding. In Hollywood we do those things in a business-like way. I'm going to give you a contract before you leave this train. And just why are you doing all of this for me? For you? But I'm doing this for me, too. You opened my eyes. I've been selfish. Cold. Perhaps a little bit heartless. But... say, you have a nice robe. But now I see the light. All right, Monaghan. I'm proud of you... - You know your business. - I sure do. And a little bit of everybody else's. Well, good luck. Good luck to you. I hope you have a nice vacation. I think I will now. - Have you found the baby yet? - Not a sign of it. Go upfront. Work your way back. - Look everywhere. - Right, sergeant. You know, maybe I've had you all wrong. Maybe. But of course you've got me all wrong. I assure that... Come in. Sorry to disturb you, gentleman, but we're looking for a missing baby. - Missing baby? - That's right. Well, I guess you haven't got him in here. Got him? We haven't even seen him. Sorry to have troubled you. That's all right. That's all right. What do you suppose that's all about? - Shh. I sent for them. - You? Yes, you see, Miss Tremaine's little adopted baby is missing. But now I've changed my mind. I wish to say nothing about it. Besides, how can I tell anything about it when I don't know where it is. If you don't. I do. - You know where the baby is? - Certainly. I just left him a little while ago. - He's in April's room. - Aye, aye, aye. Excuse me, please. Excuse me, please. It's a matter of life or maybe death. Good morning, Mr. Cupid. And how do you feel? That's right. Smile. You've got something to smile about. Why, if it hadn't been for you... Ivan? Shh. So it is the truth. - He's here. - The baby? - Where should he be? - Any place but here. But why? Listen, darling, I'll try to tell it to you gently. Think of everything, the most terrible that's ever happened in your life. And this is worse. This baby is kidnapped. Kidnapped? But I thought... You thought... I thought... Patsy thought. Only that big half wit engineer, he didn't think. May I come in? Certainly come in. What are you waiting for? Good morning! - Goodnight. - So we haven't got the baby. So what have we got to lose? Well, where did he come from? Come from? Come from? Could the baby that size come from someplace? Where is he going? That's important. - Now what do we do? - Oh, he's all yours. - I'm fired. - You're hired again. Aye! Shh. - Who is there? - The police. Aye, aye, aye, aye. What are we gonna do? I'm leaving. How do you open a window? - Quiet. - Shh. Just one minute, please. We are in the conference. Shh. Shh. I'll get the... Take him in there. Me? Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. Now remember your big scene in "The Scarlet Lady?" The one where the sister dies? Exactly. Of course I do but... We have no time for buts. Come. Come in. My darling, you shouldn't worry. Ah, good morning, officer. You must excuse Miss Tremaine. - You know, it was quite a shock. - Of course. I wish I had better news to report. I know. I know, but what can we do? Please relax. Relax, my darling. Now, if I could get one or two details. Of course. Of course. But please be seated. This case reminds me very much of one similar in Russia. Winter time. It was snowing. It's always snows in Russia. Oh. Shh. Quiet. Quiet. Shh. Who is it? Police. - Good morning. - Shh. Miss Prottle. I got you. I've just come to tell you that everything is okay. Oh, a train load full of police and everything's okay? You mean they're looking for the kid? - What do you think they're looking for? - What's the difference? They'll never find him because he ain't on the train. Oh, he isn't? What do you think that is? A singer's midget? Impossible. It can't be. - But it is. - Yeah. - Who is it? - Police. Oh! Just a moment, please. Shh. Here. Take the baby. Get in there and keep quiet! Shh. Shh. Coming. - Is that someone knocking? - Yes. And that's no woodpecker. - Good morning. - Good morning. Oh, it's him. - Who? - Renfrew. Oh, don't mind her, officer. It's the uniform. Her uncle used to be a fireman. Oh. Do you mind answering - a few questions? - Not at all, Renfrew. Sit down. Where'd you leave your horse? - My horse? - Mm-hm. Look, lady. All I want is a little information. - Do you mind? - No, I don't mind if that's the way you feel about it. I've been listening to you for 47 weeks. But now I don't care whether you kiss her or not. Look, lady, one question. Did you kiss her? - Do you mind? - Oh, no. Not at all. Go right ahead. What am I gonna do now? What you are gonna do now is not important. When you do it, that's the thing. And you are not going to do it here. You must go out. But quick. Hurry. Please! Please! Hurry! Well, I'm sorry to have troubled you ladies. Oh, it was no trouble at all. - Goodbye. - Must you go, Renfrew? - Yes, he must. - Well, do you think - he'll be back? - That's what I'm afraid of. Thanks very much. I haven't found a thing, sir. Well, all we can do is fill out the report. All right. - All aboard! - All aboard! How are you? Okay. What did I ever do to you? This is a fine time to be laughing. 177 years. Please, oh, help me. What's this we're coming to? - Philadelphia. - Philadelphia. Philadelphia. That's an inspiration. - What? - We'll get off. Oh, but I thought we were going to New York. New York. How can we go to New York with batteries of newspaper men waiting to photograph Miss April Tremaine with her adopted baby. And what happens? Her adopted baby ain't legal. It's kidnapped! But you said we were getting off the train without the baby. Listen, darling. Listen. 50 million newspaper readers know that Miss April Tremaine got on a Broadway Limited in Chicago with an adopted baby. And what are we going to tell them when we get off in New York without the baby? And what are we going to tell the police? Well, don't forget there are police in Philadelphia, too. Shh! Shh. I was afraid you weren't gonna make it. I wouldn't miss it. Where is the kid? Is he okay? Everything is okay. It worked like a charm. - Come on. - All aboard! Stop worry, everybody! There is a solution to all of this. All we have to do is to think of it. I don't know why you're all so glum and worried. Personally I'm quite thrilled. She's thrilled. Excuse me, please. Miss Prottle, I assure you, the electric chair is... Besides, personally you're not connected with the matter. I know. I just wish I were. Why, you're all heroes! Heroes? That's not what they call them in Sing Sing. Oh. Why Miss Prottle is absolutely right. Why of course she is. Here the whole world is searching for the baby and we have it right here safe and sound. Yeah. Why, this is the biggest story that ever broke. We've got it right in the palm of our hands. - Of course. - Why, certainly it will put April Tremaine on the front page of every newspaper in the world. Now listen... Excuse me. I've made up my mind. As soon as I get to New York I'm gonna surrender. Surrender? Why, Mike, you're a hero! You set me up. I'll be the first one to shake your hand. - Pleased to meet you. - All right. Save it. Save it. Now go get that baby. When we get off this train they'll carry us around - on their shoulders. - Sure. Sure. - All right. Hurry up. - Hurry up. My friends, I've cleared up everything. Well, - come in! Come in. - Pardon me. You wanted - your compartment, so I... - Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You may go. An Ivanski always keeps his word. Well, nearly always. My friend, your check for $50,000. $50,000 in real money? It ain't no hay. And your contracts for the clinic. Please sign on the dotted line. Your contract for the clinic? - You mean that Ivan... - That's right. You see I didn't wanna tell you until I was sure. Why, Ivan, that's the nicest thing you've done in your whole life. Listen, what do you think? The baby is gone! Gone? Yeah. When I got there, the baby was gone. Oh, but he must still be - on the train. - Exactly. Search every place. Call the conductor. - Get the police! - Come on, let's get going. - Spread out! - Search every place. I'll go this way! - May I go, too? - Yeah. You may go, too. Pennsylvania Station, New York. Pardon me, sir. Pulling a fast one, huh? - Give me that kid. - Wait. It's a mistake. - Now, listen. - Listen nothing. Take it easy! Oh, so you wanna play, huh? - Now, wait a minute... - I got no time. - Now, wait a minute... - Hey, Mike. - Where are you? - I'm right in here. What's going on? Everything's taken care of. There's the kid and these are the guys - that stubbed him. - Now, wait a minute. Listen to me. This is a mistake, I tell you. Oh, yeah? Well, this is no mistake, you baby snatcher. Here. You gather them up and I'll meet you on the platform. - Right. - Now wait a minute, lady, you're not going anywhere with that kid. Oh, yes, she is. - Thank you. - Nothing. Nothing to it at all. - See you later. - Okay. Come on, kiddies. Come on, step right up. Get a load of the greatest story that ever broke. We have the Pierson kid safe and sound and that ain't all. We've got the kidnappers, too. The Pierson kid? What do you mean the kidnappers? Why, the Pierson kid has been home since 9 o'clock last night. You mean this isn't the Pierson baby? That's what I've been trying to tell you. - That's my baby. - I'm the baby's father. I'm the baby's father! You... well, who are these two mugs? Mugs? This is my brother and brother-in-law from Philadelphia. I only let you have the baby when I heard you were going to New York. I figured I could use the $500 to have a family reunion. My relatives have never seen the baby. What about the baby's mole? My baby hasn't got a mole. What do you call this? What, this thing here? Oh, dear! That's my beauty mark. I've been looking all over for it all morning. Beauty mark? Come on. Let's get out of here. So... Well, I guess I'd better be going. - Yeah. Me, too. - Just a moment, Miss Riley. Come on, honey. Let's get out of here before something else happens. - So long, Ivan. - Goodbye, Ivan. Oh, goodbye Miss Tremaine. - Goodbye. - Bye, children. Bye. Miss Riley, we're leaving for the coast this afternoon. Oh, no more orders, my friend. I am leaving for Niagara Falls this morning. Or am I? But definitely. You mean you'll be happy with him? Aye, aye, aye, aye. Aye, aye, aye? She means it. Say, I just thought of something. Where is the clinic going to be? You know what, in all the excitement, I forgot to look. It must say in here some place though. Let's see. Yes. Here it is right here. To be located at 3685 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California. Why, that's right across the street from the studio. I'll be seeing you. - I'll be seeing you. - Toodle-oo. But I... Oh, Renfrew?
