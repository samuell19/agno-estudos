( mysterious theme playing ) Oh, hello, hi. How'd you get in? I thought I had the gate locked. What do you want with me? What are you doing here? Leave me alone! Leave me alone! You hear me! Leave me alone! ( action theme playing ) Leave me alone, I say! ( strangled scream ) ( tense theme playing ) Bye-bye. It was fun. My house tomorrow then? Sure. I'll call you. Goodbye, Mrs. Hassanover. It was so nice meeting you. Thank you. It was nice meeting you too. ( chattering ) ( Hassanover screams ) ( brakes screech ) ( horn honking ) ( engine whirring ) ( pop music playing ) ( music stops ) ( clears throat ) ( yawns ) ROGUE: Another beautiful day. ( scoffs ) What's so beautiful about it? ( tender theme playing ) No fee there. Good morning, Maggie. Your coffee and donut, Mr. Rogue. It's gonna be one of those days. Mr. Rogue. What do you want me to call you, lover? Lover? Why not? It's been heard of. So is eating three meals a day. All right. I keep count. You haven't been paid in a couple weeks. One month and three weeks. Look. If there's one thing I can't stand is your nagging early in the morning before I have my coffee. What did you do? Get up on the wrong side of the couch? ( sighs ) Come on, Maggie. I'm doing my best. So am I from now on. Now, what is that supposed to mean? I met a man. What's the matter? Not enough sugar in your coffee lately? You're always telling me if I meet anybody that I really like-- That's right, Maggie. Yeah. I constantly say things like that. Honey, I can't take it anymore. That makes two of us. You're not sore? About my girl's having coffee with somebody else? Of course not. Why should I be sore about a thing like that? At least you were a good secretary as secretaries go. You are sore. Sure. Good secretaries are hard to find. It's not as if I haven't asked you to give up this stupid business. Oh, it's not that. Following you around straying females and reporting to their husbands. Taking on a security job where you almost get yourself killed. And your gallery of clients. Now, those are to remind me of my great successes. Thos are to remind you of all the fees you didn't collect. It's no use talking to you. No use. I'm sorry. Maggie? Maggie! You haven't had your morning coffee. It'd keep me awake tonight. ROGUE: A beautiful way to start a lousy Tuesday. Beautiful. Maggie never did know how to hang up pants. I gotta get that gun out of hoc one of these days. I may need it. ( telephone rings ) Confidential Human Relations. Who? Oh, uh, just a moment, doctor. Yeah. What was your name again? Dr. Jonas Pettingill? What can I do for you, doctor? Oh, yes, I guess my staff did sent out a few of my cards the other day. Uh, well, uh, let me check my appointment pad. Uh, let's see. This is, uh, Tuesday the 30th. Uh-huh. I have a luncheon date at the Hilton. Uh... I'm tied up all afternoon. But, uh, I can see you this morning. Uh-huh. In about 20 minutes. Let me get that address. ( typewriter keys clacking ) Right. I'll see you in 20 minutes, doctor. Goodbye. Sending out my personal cards to names in a telephone book had been Maggie's idea. What she'd said was if anybody deals with goonies in trouble it's a psychiatrists. They might want to recommend one of their patients to a good confidential agent. Good old Maggie. It was starting to pay off. Which just goes to show. You never know what day the phone's gonna ring and who'll be at the other end of the line waving money at you. WOMAN ( on recording ): ...When Jack and I got on-- WOMAN ( over phone ): Dr. Pettingill? What is it? Mr. John Rogue to see you, sir. Send him in. ( recording stops ) Mr. Rogue. Good morning. Thanks for being so prompt. Sit down. Fortunately, I did have some free time this morning. I appreciate it. What I have to discuss with you is a rather delicate matter. I've never had the occasion to hire a-- ROGUE: Looks like he can afford me. How much shall I ask? 45? No. Fifty bucks a day and expenses. What can I do for you? Well, the subject in this case is a very beautiful girl who came over here from Europe a couple of years ago. She's been a patient of mine for, uh, about two months. Cigarette? Oh, thank you. Uh... The point being that... Do you have a match, doctor? There's one over on the table over there. You always wear your tie like that? Yeah. Little untidy, don't you think? A little. You were saying something about the point being. Point being that I as a doctor have no right to divulge any of her personal life especially to a stranger such as yourself. You might say a little untidiness in ethics. Precisely. My concern is not that of a doctor for his patient, What's the matter with me? He's concerned. Sixty a day. I understand. The subject... Valerie York. What's the matter? Small world, that's all. PETTINGILL: Do you know Miss York? ROGUE: No, I never met her. But a friend of mine did. In fact, he was gonna marry her. You knew, uh, Frank Sawyer? Close friend of mine. He was killed skydiving. The motivational drive behind Ms. York's problem. Her desire for self-destruction. You mean she wants to kill herself? And will in a matter of hours. No longer than a matter of days. What exactly do you want me to do? I'm gonna hire you on a strictly confidential basis. I want you to follow her. Watch her every move. Where she goes, who she sees. And, should the occasion arise, you will have to keep her from taking her own life. Even at the risk of your own. Well, that's what $75 a day and expenses buys you, doctor. My services and, if necessary, my life. I'll have my accountant prepare you a retainer fee. Meanwhile, it is my hope that, uh, through your investigation we may be able to help her. It's my hope too. ROGUE: So that's where she lives. My subject: Valerie York. ( tender theme playing ) What was it Frank Sawyer used to say? She's like a song you'll never forget. Maybe that was the song he used to hear in his head all the time he was in Vietnam. It's really ironic. To facing the dangers of war, comes back here, goes skydiving with her and his shoot doesn't open. ( tender theme playing ) ( engine revs ) Okay, baby. A little "follow the leader" time. You lead and you can be sure I'll follow. ( suspenseful theme playing ) No, not-- not this one. Uh, this is our Olympus model. The handles are too garish. Confidentially, I agree with you. Much too garish. This is a very popular model. It's number 432. VALERIE: Is this waterproofed? MAN: No. The waterproofed models, uh, are a little more expensive. VALERIE: Well, then it's out. MAN: Uh, this, however, is waterproof. VALERIE: Oh, now, this. MAN: May I show you? Well, sedate, in good taste, exquisite satin. And durable. This model will last throughout eternity. I always said in buying jewel, the box it comes in must be exquisite. Yes. A loved on will look very peaceful in this model. Uh, serene, I might add. Yes. This will do. I understand the burial plot has already been selected. And also the headstone. I'll just check this model number. Now, the music to be sung at the funeral. If I might suggest. Something that is not too gloomy. Inspirational music. Good. Well, uh, that leaves just one last little item. Inasmuch as the headstone has been selected, I can tell the engravers to start on the markings. Now, uh, just the name of the loved one that interred? Valerie York. Valerie York. ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( tires screech ) ROGUE: By the way she's driving, the cemetery engravers could have the date on her tombstone in a hurry. ( engine sputtering ) My first good job in a long time and I have to run out of gas. Out of gas. Out of cigarettes. I wonder if there's anything I'm not out of. ( grunting ) ( panting ) Hey. I saw you two at the cemetery. Yeah. We were pallbearers at a funeral. You're lucky it wasn't yours. Okay, wise guy. Why were you following Valerie York? Is that who it was? He's cute. ( grunts ) I gotta be careful, boys. They're capped. Who hired you to follow her? Nobody. I just like to chase skirts. All right. That's enough. Keep away from her. If you don't you're gonna wake up in an alley with the cats looking at you. ( mysterious theme playing ) ROGUE: Well, that friendly little visit changed the whole complexion of this case. Hmm. Came near to changing my whole complexion. If Valerie York wanted to die, that was her private business. But those two goons hit me in the face with the fact that there was more to it than that. A lot more. But what? Out of cigarettes. Out of answers. Out of luck. I wonder if Miss York has some answers. ( line ringing ) Now, let's see. The penalty for breaking and entering a girl's apartment could cost me my license. Maybe even a few months in the pokey. But then for $75 a day and expenses a man is expected to stick his neck out. ( dramatic theme playing ) She was here and yet she wasn't, if that makes any sense. Christmas Night. Expensive. MAN: * Valerie * Valerie, are you in love With sorrow? * * Tempting fate You can't wait * * Careless about tomorrow * Must you be unhappy * Living each moment only * In your world It's wrong to be glad * * It's right to be sad And lonely * * Valerie * Valerie everything has It's reason * * Happiness loneliness * Even love changes seasons * And so the riddle That you are * * Begins to torment me * Please help me Solve the mystery * * Of your heart, Valerie WOMAN ( over phone ): Apartment answering service. I'd like to speak with Valerie York, please. WOMAN: I'm sorry, Miss York is not in. May I take a message, please? Do you have a location on her? No, we don't. Who shall I say is calling, please? When do you expect her? If you leave me your name and number, I'll have her call you when she returns. Thank you. ROGUE: Temple of Hope Club. East Manor Drive. Young, beautiful, money. Everything a girl could want. Yet she wants to kill herself. Valerie York. Valerie York. ( doorbell rings ) VAN: Valerie! Well, now, that can't be the Avon lady. Valerie! Valerie, I picked up your pictures. Hurry it up, babe. We've gotta be there in 15 minutes. I don't think we've met. ROGUE: We have now. I didn't know Valerie had company. I didn't know she was expecting company. No, obviously you didn't. Who shall I say almost interrupted us? Van. And the message? Tell her I'll be at the club tonight. Sure thing, Van. Afraid I didn't catch the name. Reed. Danny Reed. You, uh.... Of course, uh, a close friend of hers. ( chuckles ) You could say that. It's, uh, odd we've never met before. Are, uh, you in some sort of business, Mr. Reed? Mm-hm. Confidential Human Relations. Very funny fellow. Try me at card tricks sometime. ( door closes ) Now, there's a couple of things I have to know. Besides Frank Sawyer's death, what else is bugging Valerie? Well, ahem, she's a very glamorous woman who's had almost every human experience. The "almost" is important. Of late, she's obsessed with the idea that there are some things un-experienced. Like dying. She's done everything twice. The third time is a bore. Of late, she feels compelled to accept every challenge, large or small. Scuba diving at unheard-of depths. Racing cars. Skydiving. What are some of the small challenges like? Whatever the whim of the moment dictates. Who's Van? Has she ever spoken of him? Yes. Edmund Van Dermot. Family friend. Ever hear of this place? Temple of Hope Club? Yes. Why? I think she's going there tonight. That's the best news I've heard. Why? Well, the Temple of Hope Club is designed to help people like Valerie. It, uh, might be called, uh, Suicides Anonymous. Run by a Mr. Roy Benz. You mean if you're in the mood to kill yourself you call them up and they talk you out of it? It means considerably more than that. The people of the club meet, exchange ideas, freely admit fits of depression that often lead to thoughts of suicide. It's a form of therapy through, uh, which they often find a new reason for living. I've been looking for a place like that for years. ( knocks ) Good evening. I'm sorry. This is a private club. Each member has his own key. How do I get one? Well, I'm afraid they're restricted. I think I qualify. Well, we don't admit strangers. My name's Danny Reed. I'm sorry, Mr. Reed. And, uh, ahem, I was recommended. BENZ: By who, might I ask? A friend of Valerie York's. Edmund Van Dermot. Yes, yes. Well, you should have said that at once. Won't you come in, please? In closing, I'd like to say that I think the men and women of this organization should help each other. Well, I admit, too, I was on the edge of... Ah, I see Mr. Van Dermot's engaged at the moment. Well, that's old Van. He's always making a speech. Oh, a testimonial. You see, our members freely relate their experiences with one another. We'll wait until he's through and then he'll introduce you to the others. Our friend, our benefactor. Oh, by the way, I am Roy Benz. Nice to meet you, Mr. Benz. I've heard a lot about you. Your good work. Excuse me, Mr. Benz, there's a crisis call for you. Oh, I'll take it in my office. Excuse me? Crisis call? Yes. Yes. Somewhere in the city, a human being is contemplating taking his life. We get calls of this kind 24 hours a day. Make yourself comfortable. VAN: I don't have to say in so many words what we owe Roy Benz. It can be said in one word: life. Our lives. Yeah? What happened to Mrs. Hassanover's life? ROGUE: Hassanover? Now, Mr. Benz has rehabilitated many. The man who conceived the idea and... Oh, yeah. Alicia Hassanover. I guess Benz didn't get her crisis call. Maybe the line was busy. But sometimes, though rarely, the fates will not be cheated of their appointment in Samarra. As you just mentioned, poor Mrs. Hassanover, despite all our efforts, in the end, her death wish prevailed. Nothing could stop her tragic suicide. Yeah, she foolishly chose the fumes of carbon monoxide to the fresh air of this earth. Yes, exactly. Not only Mrs. Hassanover. The same has happened to Oscar Ludman. He hung himself. You definitely should come more often. We had a very successful reading last night. I wish you would have been here. You could really understand what it's all about. I have a small challenge for you. That's been tried before. Anyway-- I thought there was no challenge you wouldn't except. Excuse me. All right. Try me. Even though I'm a complete stranger, I want you to pretend you know me. Shouldn't be so hard to do. Challenge accepted. VAN: Hello, Reed. Good to see you again. How are things? Oh, much better. Thank you. Oh, I don't know what you mean by much better. You seemed to be doing all right the last time I saw you. He always does all right. You should know. It's your move. Our move. To the bar. Would you excuse us? Mm-hm. Excuse me, sir. Do you have another cigarette? I'm sorry, it's my last one. Thank you. I have some here. MAN: Thank you. Uh, usual, Miss York? Mm-hm. I'll have the same, whatever that is. Scotch over the rocks. I said, I'll have the same. Now, why did Van mean when he said I should know? He thinks that you and I play house. How should he get that idea? He's got a dirty mind. Miss York. Sir. Cheerios. What? Cheerios. That's what a man and woman say to each other in Europe. You mean when they're in love. Maybe. Cheerios. ( door opens ) I once knew someone who was in love with you. Frank Sawyer. You knew Frank? ROGUE: He was a friend of mine. VALERIE: We were going to be married. ROUGE: I know. Darling, can I see you for a moment? Darling, would you mind? Of course not, darling. Call me. It's important. About Frank Sawyer. ( clears throat ) Interesting. Excuse me. How come Van Dermot's lost so many points with you? He plays games. You don't like games? Not his kind. What kind do you play? Whatever suits the occasion. I see, Mr. Rogue. I didn't tell you my name. Van just found out that's your real name. But what's in a name? Better question: What's in a drink? Something the matter? Always. In my racket, seems there's always something the matter. Mr. Rogue. ( screams ) Oh! Mr. Reed. ( pop music playing over radio ) ( music stops ) Call me. It's very important. It's about Frank Sawyer. Scotch over the rocks. Cheerios. ( police siren wailing ) ( car tires screech ) You gumshoes always sleep with your clothes on? If I didn't, somebody might steal them. If you tell me what you're trying to find, I'll let you know if you're getting warm. You wouldn't know by chance, would you? I know you're keeping me from my sleep. What happened? One of my neighbors call and say I was having a wild party? We were told we'd find something interesting up here. Perfume. Yeah, there was something interesting up here. Bare as Mother Hubbard. Let's go. ( sighs ) Here. Live it up, Shamus. Thanks. ( engine starts ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( grunts ) He's dead. ( chuckles ) ROUGE: Christmas Night perfume. The office reeked of it. It added up. A dead bartender that wanted to talk about Frank and some knockout drops in my drink. They added up just fine. Valerie. ( mysterious theme playing ) ( screams ) Go ahead and scream! That's the nice thing about... ( screams ) ...these modern apartments. You can't hear your neighbors fighting. ( both grunting ) How did you get in here? Maybe I borrowed Van Dermot's gold key. And what do you want? I want the answers to a few questions. Starting with why you put those knockout drops in my drink and a corpse in my office. You don't know what you're talking about. ( grunting ) Hey. You're pretty good. That's quite an act, lady. When you passed out last night, Mr. Benz thought it was because you cut your wrists recently and you were in a weakened condition. Weakened? I had to be a sucker for a Mickey. You had these bandages on your wrists. Sure. Those were my tickets to Suicides Anonymous. Had it been AA I would have brought a bottle. Now start making sense. I don't know what happened to you last night in the club. The truth is I don't know you. Oh, bitch. Look, mister, you're not a challenge anymore. Breaking and entering in here, you've got to be crazy. Yeah, the way I was last night at the club, crazy is the word. Now, your love for Frank, tell me some more about your great love for Frank. Nobody speaks about Frank like that. Not you and not anybody! He was too nice a guy to be kicked in the teeth by a broad like you. To fight a war and come back here and die in a phony accident. You don't know what you're saying! Get away from me! Let me go! Get away from me. ( crying ) ( panting ) For 75 bucks a day, I don't know if you're worth it. All right. I was wrong about you. Has to be I was wrong about you. But then what about that perfume in my office? Answer to that is anybody can buy perfume and sprinkle it around, make it seem like there was a woman there. Hey, do you know that was a pretty dumb thing you just tried to pull. ( sighs ) Next time I make it, you won't be there and I'll make it all the way. Oh, yeah? Won't you be surprised if I'm down there at the bottom waiting to catch you, huh? Excuse me if I don't laugh. Solve a lot of problems if you would laugh. You'd solve my problems if you'd just leave me alone. ( crying ) Dr. Jonas Pettingill, is that your doctor? Yes. ( tapping on phone keypad ) Hello. Is this Dr. Jonas Pettingill? My name is John Rogue. Yes. I'm in the apartment of a patient of yours. Her name is Valerie York. Doctor, she just tried to take a high dive out of her window. I think you'd better get over here. Right. Look, Sam, nobody really wants to die. Sam? I remember Frank said he used to call you that sometimes. Only when he was angry at me. Right now I'm angry with you. He used to call me Sam to put me down. Nobody should ever put you down. It's no use. Thanks, Rogue. ( knocks on door ) It's open. ( sighs ) Glad to see you. She's in a bad way. What are you doing here? My dear, you're gonna be all right. It doesn't matter. Not anymore. I'll fix a sedative. It'll calm you. You had no business breaking in on her. I was doing the job you hired me for. I hired you to watch her, not to make love to her. What? You're fired. Now get out of here before I call the police and have you booked for breaking in. This'll make you sleep. ( mysterious theme playing ) ROUGE: Off the case. If it turned out Frank Sawyer's death wasn't an accident, I'd never be off the case. Anyway, right now I have another problem. A stiff problem lying cold and glassy-eyed in the trunk of the car. Jocko, I think you and I could use a drink. ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( car tires screech ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. ( whistling ) Evening, officer. OFFICER: What's the trouble? Oh, no trouble now but I could have used you a little while ago. He's had a little too much to drink. Who is he? Jocko, our bar man at the club. If there's one thing I hate, it's a bartender who lushes it up after hours. On our bonded stock. Passed out, eh? Not exactly. No that was the trouble. You see, he insisted on driving. I had to clip him one. Uh, would you excuse me, please? Thank you. How about you? Are you all right? Oh, I don't drink. Last booze I had packed too much of a wallop. Well, he'll thank you in the morning for not letting him drive tonight. Good night, officer, and thank you for your courtesy. WOMAN ( over dispatcher ): 20L36, 20L36, traffic accident. ( engine starts ) ( jazzy, seductive theme playing ) Do me a favor, Jocko. When you see Frank Sawyer, say hello for me. ROGUE: Good night, Jocko. Smoggy Wednesday, beautiful alley. No Maggie, no coffee, headache. Obituary column in the morning paper says Alicia Hassanover is laid in the Quiet Valley cemetery. Not that she's in the position to tell me anything, but maybe somebody else can. Right this way. Yes, I did make all the arrangements for Mrs. Hassanover, but I didn't know that she had a brother. I was away. Oh. I understand it's a custom of many estates to delay funeral payment until after they receive the insurance money. That's right. Was that true with my sister's estate? I'm afraid so. Waiting payment must be hard on you. Oh, uh, we manage. Do you happen to remember the name of the insurance company? Yes. Her husband showed me the policy. Oh, it's quite common practice. It shows proof that the money will be paid eventually. It was the, uh... Greystone Life. What kind of coverage? Well, there was a $50,000 personal policy and a $20,000 policy to the organization. What organization? Why, the Temple of Hope. The $20,000 policy was made payable to a Mr. Roy Benz. He's the founder and president of the club. I thought it was against the law to bequeath money to an uninterested party or organization. No. Not if the policy holder owes a large amount of money to a person or to an organization. I see. My sister owed money to Mr. Benz. Well, that was my understanding of it. Of course, Mr. Benz must supply proof of such a debt. Usually by a promissory note or an IOU. But if you're thinking of making a claim on this insurance, I, uh-- I suggest that you see them about it. Is that clear? Very clear. In fact, you've cleared up a lot of things. ROUGE: I called Mrs. Oscar Ludman. She was sure her husband had hung himself. I wasn't. He also had an insurance policy made out to Roy Benz. Twenty Gs. Frank Sawyer had just one insurance policy made out to his parents in the East. Looks like he doesn't fit into the picture. He wasn't even a member of the Temple of Hope Club. Yet I'm sure his so-called accidental death ties in somewhere. Questions with no answers. If the Temple of Hope Club was a racket, how does it work? Suppose the original applications for insurance on Oscar Ludman and Mrs. Hassanover were forgeries. Suppose the promissory notes were forgeries. Who stood to gain? The beneficiary. Roy Benz. ( suspenseful music playing on radio ) ( wind whistles ) ( music stops ) ( telephone rings ) Office of confidential-- VALERIE ( over phone ): Rogue, you were right. I don't want to die. I need your help. Can you help me? Where are you? ( door opens ) Where are you calling from? Valerie? Valerie? Valerie? Valerie? PETTINGILL: The underlying motivation of the patient's problem dates back to an early childhood experience. Where is she? Isn't it customary to be announced? Where's Valerie? Where she is and what she does is no longer any business of yours. She called me and asked me for help. And you came on the run. Where do I find her? Tell me, do you always fall in love with your clients? Just the ones that wear skirts. Get out of here. I said get out of here. Tell me about the high recommendation you give the Temple of Hope Club, doctor. That's where you send your patients, isn't it, huh? The manic depressives. And Roy Benz builds them up with a lot of hot air, sweetness and light, making sure that he gets samples of their signature. What are you talking about? A suicides anonymous club that is anything but that. See, I have the feeling that Roy Benz is running a murder mill. Ah, nonsense. Temple of Hope? Some hope. Attracting the sick and the desperate who are clinging to life by a fingernail. Giving them a phony salvation then wiping them out like so many ants off a picnic table. Ridiculous. Well, I intend to see whether it is ridiculous and if you aren't linked with it. Just a minute. If she's missing, you're responsible. What you don't realize is Miss York was-- "Was," doctor? You just used the past tense. I didn't mean to say that. Where is she? I don't know. How would you like to be dead? Like Mrs. Hassanover, Ludman, and Frank Sawyer. Don't threaten me. I find her dead, dead is gonna be the way you end up. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. ( Rouge whistles ) Oh, hello, Mr. Rogue, uh... I didn't hear you come in. I thought you might need a new bartender. I never thought I'd see you again. You never expected to see Jocko again either. Why did you kill him, Rogue? You think I killed him? Then why don't you pick up the phone and call the police? Oh, that's right, you did call them. Told them they'd find something interesting in my office. The trouble is you didn't specify what or who. That wasn't very fair, Mr. Benz. I didn't call anybody. Let's see, what did you tell them? "This is a concerned citizen," something like that? Right now I'm the concerned citizen. Ah, you amuse me. And I'm going to become even more amusing. Now, I want to know what you did with Valerie York. What I've done with her? Why, I scarcely know the lady. ( door opens ) ( grunts ) ( both grunt ) Now, there's a few things I've gotta find out about, Benz, and I'll bet they lead me right back to you. ( grunts ) ROGUE: I had to find Valerie, but where do I look? That soft scared voice of hers on the phone asking me for help. How can you help someone you can't find? Maybe Van Dermot has the answer. Six Van Dermots, but no Edmund. When all else fails the confidential Human Relation manual on page 16 paragraph B states, "Return to the scene of." MAN: As soon as you find out anything, call me. Yes. No, I said before. It is very important, I don't care what time it is. No matter what time you call. That's the thing that really is important. You understand that? I... Rogue, where is she? Beat me to the punch. What have you done with her? Did it again. ( scoffs ) I've been every place I can think of she might be. Called all her friends. Not a trace. Maybe she doesn't trust her friends anymore. How much do you know? About her or her friends. You must think I'm the kind that kisses and tells. Don't play cute with me. I wanna know what you're up to. Up to my neck. Using my name to get into the club last night. Telling me you were somebody called Danny Reed. Pretending footsie with Valerie. You're not in her league. You're about to strike out too. What were you doing at the club last night? Having a Mickey Finn over the rocks. Roy Benz is very upset. He said you bothered the widow of one of our members. Mrs. Ludman didn't seem upset when I called her. You had no right to call her. I guess I'm just pushy. Keep away from our club. Our club? Uh, I didn't mean to imply by that. I knew if I let you talk long enough you'd finally say something interesting. Where would I go if I were Valerie and wanted to hide? Where would she go if Frank were still alive? Hey, the little place he had down at the beach. Yeah, it's worth a try. ( mellow theme playing ) ( tires screech ) Man, the times Frank and I had at that beach house. Hot summer days and Singapore Slings. Lots of Singapore Slings. And broads everywhere. That's where I learned the fine points of touch football. Wonder if the place has been sold yet. Real estate people usually leave a key somewhere. Everything the same. But is it? Is anything ever the same? VALERIE: Rogue! Rogue! Rogue! Rogue. Oh, Rogue. I'm glad to see you. I have been looking everyplace for you. I could hear a car coming, I didn't know who it was so I went outside and hid until I saw it was you. Now, what is this all about, hmm? I'm scared, Rogue. Why? Last night, after Dr. Pettingill gave me that sedative, he also gave me a post-hypnotic command to kill myself. That's one way to make a suicide look real. The sound of a certain music was to trigger me. But I found the tape recorder that was playing it and managed to turn it off. That's when you phoned me. Yes. While I was on the phone I saw the doorknob turn, I didn't wait to find out who it was. I raced through the kitchen, down to where my car was parked and simply started driving not knowing where to go or what to do. Then I remembered this place and I came here. Valerie, why didn't you call the police? Dr. Pettingill is very convincing. He'd tell them that I was a patient of his and convince them that I had a hallucination of some kind. They'd probably believe him too. What am I gonna do, Rogue? I can't just keep on hiding. Can they trace you here? I don't know. I might have talked in one of my sessions with the doctor about it. Come on. If I could think of a reason why Dr. Pettingill wants me dead. ROGUE: To collect on your insurance. VALERIE: I don't have any insurance. ROGUE: Frank didn't have any insurance either, but he's gotta fit in someplace. ( tires screech ) Come on. ( suspenseful theme playing ) Oh! My car, it's up on the highway. The keys. Under the mat. ( engine revs ) ( tires screeching ) When I said I want to die, this wasn't the way I had in mind. Yeah, those two goons behind us are trying to change your mind. You found this kind of driving, but just oblige them. They wanted someone to get killed and they got it. ( mysterious theme playing ) I like your dress. Thank you. Hungry? Tired. Tired of running and being chased and beat up. Having a body dumped in my office. Doesn't make me happy that a Beverly Hills psychiatrist threaten to have you committed because of some records he holds over your head. I'm not exactly happy about it myself. If we could get in his office, get our hands on your case history file, that would be a start. But how do we do that? We can't. No, Sam, not by sitting here we can't. I like you calling me Sam. It makes me feel very safe. I wonder what Freudian symbolism Dr. Pettingill would read into that. And what would you read into that? ( both chuckle ) Microphone, please. Right this way, sir. ( car engine revs ) A cleaning woman found the body. The murdered man's name was Dr. Jonas Pettingill, a psychiatrist. I understand the police have a suspect. Yes. You see, the doctor had a tape recorder in his office going when the suspect came in. Evidently, he didn't realize that the conversation was being recorded. The doctor called the man with him by name. And we have a voice track of the suspect threatening the doctor and the doctor's voice calling out, "Don't shoot! Don't shoot!" The last thing on the tape is the sound of a gunshot. Can you reveal the name of the suspect? All I can say is we have an APB out for John Rogue, private investigator. We'll have him in custody very soon. Can you give a description of him? LEE: Oh, he's 6 feet 2, fair complexion, dark hair, medium build. Thank you, Detective Lee. This is KTVX News, channel 85. Thank you. OFFICER: Hold it. Something wrong? Can I see your driver's license? Sure. I don't have it with me, I left my wallet in my other coat. Oh, officer, this is my car. Here's my license. I've been driving. We just stopped to see what all the commotion was. If you'd have used your eyes, you'd have seen the curb is painted red. Honey, look where you parked the car. Now that nice man is gonna give you a ticket. I'm so sorry. Here comes an old friend of mine. That's Rogue. Seal off the area. ( quacking ) ( dramatic theme playing ) Rogue, why didn't you tell me you killed the doctor? It slipped my mind. He threatened to harm me and you lost your temper. You're losing your marbles. I didn't kill him. You didn't? Of course not. Then who did? I don't know. But we may be next. Unless those cops get me first. An all-points bulletin means that every cop in the city's looking for me. Now come on. Rogue, let's get out of here. I'm not wanted by the police. I can get money. Let's go to Mexico. The trouble with that is I flunked high-school Spanish. If you're really so innocent, why don't you turn yourself in to the police and tell them your story? Because they already have a story. It's on tape by a murdered man that says I kill him. I don't think they allow care packages on death row. At least now you're being more realistic. If I could get my hands on those funny insurance policies, prove the signatures are forged and expose the Temple of Hope Club, we'd both be off the hook. We don't even know where they are. Could make an educated guess. In the safe at the club. It's a long shot, Sam, but it's my only bet left on the board. Let somebody else catch up with suicides anonymous, it doesn't have to be you. ROGUE: What time does the club close? Ten o'clock. I'll get a car. The parking lot's full of them. Please don't go. Sam, I'm wanted for murder, this is my only chance. It's locked. We'll wait here until dark. If I'm not back in ten minutes, you take off, all right? You realize what's going to happen to you if you go in there? Nothing's gonna happen. Rogue, please. Please, don't go in there. Don't you realize? I do love you, I do need you. Please, I beg you, don't go. I do. Hey, hey, hey. Listen, listen. I do love you. I do. Now you just keep that motor running, I'll be back in ten minutes. I'll tell you what, we'll make it nine minutes. Don't go, please. I'll be seeing you, Sam. ( both grunting ) I'll bet you carry a gun, Edmund. Uh-huh. All right, open up. All right, Van, now you did real nice opening the door. I want you to do just as well with the safe. Well, only Benz knows the combination. BENZ: Van, is that you? ROGUE: Hello, Mr. Benz. You're right on cue. What seems to be the matter? Oh, nothing's the matter. Turn around. I'm sure man like you don't carry a gun. Good. Now, the trouble with framing a man is it makes him reckless. If he's gonna die anyway, he has nothing to lose, only points to gain. Nobody framed you. Surely you can't mean Jocko? Ah, that innocent wine in your voice, that and 20 cents will get you a ride on a bus if you're not going too far. Now push back that picture and open the safe. Well, it's triggered with an alarm and if it's opened before morning, the alarm goes off. Mr. Benz. Open the safe. Just exactly what is it you want? Phony insurance polices to prove murder for Mrs. Hassanover on back. You're the one that's wanted for murder. The murder of Dr. Jonas Pettingill. I can't understand why you didn't deliver the doc's corpse to my office, like you did Jocko. You're not saying you didn't kill the doctor? Open it. The police have tape recording that proves you did. Those tapes were gimmicked. Cops won't buy that, Rogue. Neither will I. If you don't open that safe right now, I'm gonna open your head. Rogue. You had to be the one who shot Dr. Pettingill. It had to be me that did a lot of things I didn't do. ( all grunting ) ( gunshot ) ( groans ) You don't listen good. I told you I had nothing to lose. VALERIE: Drop the gun, Rogue. If my back wasn't turned I'd swear that you were someone I told to wait in the car. BENZ: For awhile we were afraid you weren't going to come to your senses. Just when I thought you were getting a little squeamish, trying to run out on us. Oh, I should have known better. Let's have the gun, Rogue. Drop it, Rogue. I guess I'd better. You know, I've gotta admit, I never figured it'd be you. You wouldn't listen to me. We didn't have to face this. You wouldn't go away with me. Sam, you're a lousy shot. No she isn't. She, uh, wants me to die slowly, nothing quick and easy. Slow. For a minute there, I thought... ( chuckles ) You've never known what I thought. Tell Rogue why you're going to die slowly. I'll bet it has something to do with Frank Sawyer. And this club. The whole operation is hers. She owns this club. She almost owned me. They were afraid of Frank. BENZ: She was going to marry him. If Frank ever found out about this... So that's why Frank had to be eliminated. At first they tried to convince me that Frank's death was an accident. VAN: You wouldn't buy that. And that's when the trouble started. And she and Dr. Pettingill hired you. Like I said, trouble. Meaning Valerie wanted revenge for what you did to Frank, and out of self protection, you had to get rid of her. That's right. You added it up. Added it up and pegged it right. A private vendetta. But tell me something, how did I get in the middle of all this? Oh, that's easy. She needed a soldier. A nice, strong, dumb cluck who'd be on her side and do her fighting for her against us and in the end be a patsy. She needed a patsy to cover up her, um, indiscretions. And Dr. Pettingill set you up for that the day he hired you. Why did you kill Pettingill? Because he threw in with them. The music in your apartment, hypnosis and all that junk, was he really trying to kill you? Dr. Pettingill was a fool. He was willing to help me, but only up to a point. He was in love with you, Valerie. By up to a point you mean giving me the suicide routine. Having me follow you out to the cemetery while you made your own funeral arrangements? A real princess in a tower. And I was the knight in the un-shiny armor. At what point did the good doctor back out? After she killed Jocko. And made Dr. Pettingill help her cart the body to your office. It was your perfume. Doesn't matter. Not anymore. Thanks, Rogue, for all your help. Know something? The newspapers are going to play you up big. Private eye goes on a murder rampage. Beautiful. You're really beautiful. First I kill Pettingill, then I kill these two. This one if for you. Which you will no doubt put in Mr. Van Dermot's hand. See how simple it is? Valerie, you can't. You can't do this. We've been through together, you, Roy and I. That's right, Valerie. Think of all the suicides they three of you planned. All the funerals you've gone to together. That can't go for nothing, Sam. Shut up! VAN: We can get rid of him, keep right on going the way it was before. It will never be the way it was before, not without Frank. ( both grunting ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) Don't worry. I won't ask you to let me go. You wouldn't anyway. That isn't your kind of a kick. Come on. Smile when you say goodbye to Sam. Losers don't cry in my life. And you were in my life, for awhile. A brief little while. ROGUE: And that was the way the music played for the last time in the Temple of Hope Club. I spent hours at police headquarters while they made out the report. Van Dermot was dead, and Benz wasn't gentleman enough to take the wrap for the personal and private murders committed by Valerie. He blew the whistle long and hard. John Rogue, Confidential Human Relations. That was Maggie's idea, to give me a little class. Yeah, I've got class. Good morning, Maggie. I thought you met a man. I did. And? Didn't work out. Got a thumbtack? I was worried sick. There was an APB out on your last night. It was cancelled. What happened? I met a woman. And? Didn't work out. Nothing worked out. ( sighs ) Thank you. Anytime. ( phone ringing ) If that's a case, you tell them it's 100 bucks a day. In advance. Confidential Human Relations. Well, Mr. Rogue is in conference right now, but if it's important I can probably interrupt him. Does it have anything to do with a collection? Oh, it doesn't...? MAN: * Valerie * You are in love With sorrow * * Tempting fate You can't wait * * Careless about tomorrow * You're a song I must forget * * A haunted melody * But can I ever be quite free of you * * My Valerie?
