Nini Thowok Grandma,... may your soul rest in peace. Forgive me. Forgive Naya. We love you, Grandma. Honey, Naya, come on, let's all go home. Legally, she bequeathed Mekar Jiwo to Miss Nadine and Naya entirely. This is Eyang Marni's last will and testament. She asked me to tell you never let it be closed down, as it has been established for years by both, the late Eyang Marni and her husband. Please, take a look. Since our parents died 3 years ago, I never look forward for this hotel bequeathed to me. For what purpose will this place be? She told me that she wanted this hotel bequeathed to her grandchildren for their future. I still can't believe she's gone. Poor her. She blamed herself for the car accident that killed our parents. She asked our parents to come to Solo. They got in a car accident on their way. Our deepest condolences for your family's loss. Very well, Miss Nadine, Naya, and Mr. Ben, we will excuse ourselves. We will come back once you sign the letter for validation. - We will excuse ourselves. - Thank you. I don't mind if you're moving to Solo. I will have to move in here and look for new jobs. I'm tired of living in Jakarta anyway. But I seriously have no clue how to run a hotel. Moreover, this place has been deserted. It's like living without a purpose. You don't have to make a decision right away. Let's talk about it later once you get over your grief. If you were given this hotel, what do you plan to do with it? Boutique hotel and art gallery. I can make a showroom, or workshops for young artists. Me and Naya, we'll head back to Jakarta tonight. We will return once I arrange Naya's school transfer. We can talk about this later. Ben, are you sure you okay with this? I mean, you're going back to Jakarta with Naya and return to Solo. I have so many things to get done. - But I want to accompany you. - It's fine, Dear. Ever since Eyang Marni died, the staff are at a loss as to what to do next. They need someone to manage, and that someone is you. Don't worry, I'll take good care of Naya. Right, Naya? Fine. Rahmi. Yes, Madam? What is he carrying? This is for ritual offerings. Girah told us to. It is said, someone who has just died less than 40 days, the spirit remains around us. Offering food for the dead. My granny died peacefully. She died of natural causes. Where's Girah? She's in the dining room. The black drawer, and then gebyok, which is on the side. Then table, jodang. - Girah. - Madam? We would like to show you some of the inventory of this hotel. The hotel have eight rooms, including your room, Madam. Those unused items are stored in the warehouse. As far as I remember, the hotel have nine rooms. Why did you say we only have eight rooms? One room. The room should not be opened. Since Eyang Marni took over the hotel, she forbid anyone to enter the room, even until her last breath. It's right in front of your room. Why? So one room kept closed due to unclear reason? That is such a waste. Eyang Marni is dead. - Now let's open the room. - Let's not. Let the room kept closed. The door will remain locked. We don't know what's in there. - Where's the key to this room? - Is with Rahmat. I don't have it with me anymore. Eyang Marni took it. Hi, Honey. What time will you be arriving in Solo? Our flight leaves at 4 pm. We will be arriving in the evening if there's no delay. How are you? Are you doing ok? So far so good. But I didn't sleep well last night. I had this weird feeling that something was watching me. So I slept with my lights on. Ain't that weird? I never had a experience like that. You're just tired, that's all. Better get here soon, I need your help with some work. Honey, what's that? Why are you eating flowers? Girah! What the hell is this? Why did you gave me this such food? Forgive me, Madam. If you don't like the taste, let me make you a new one. It's not about the taste, but why am I even eat flowers? Forgive us, but that is no flowers, it's your daily breakfast. - Yes, Honey? - Honey. - Did you saw me eating flowers? - Yes I did. Why should I lie? That's why I'm suprised. I really thought that you liked that. Just like Susana. Stop it, I'm serious. Don't joke around! Jar, do you know Mekar Jiwo Hotel that belongs to Nadine's family? Is it a historical building? I know you love to collect data about the historic buildings in Java. Me and Nadine have no clue what to do with it. Help me out here. As I recall, Mekar Jiwo was a guesthouse for coffee planters in the Dutch era. It was built by a very rich Chinese Indonesian in Solo. Why don't you come to my place? I will inform you once I'm in Solo. Let's go, Naya. Watch your step. Madam, forgive me for saying this, but why do you want to open this door? Please, dont. There's something not right here. - Keep trying. - Please, dont. Girah, stop it. Continue. What is this, Rahmat? Nini Thowok doll. Nini Thowok? Who even play this scary-looking doll? It's not a toy. A media for connecting with the spirit world. To summon the spirits. To summon the spirits? You mean like jailangkung? Yes, Madam. Nini Thowok doll is a female version of jailangkung. Madam Marni once told us, the previous owner of this hotel often used Nini Thowok to communicate with their ancestors spirit. To ask help from them. We never enter this room before. We didn't know Nini Thowok doll was stored here along with other stuff. Maybe all of these stuff belongs to the first owner or family that built this hotel. The first owner of this hotel is a Chinese indonesian. Her Chinese surname is Oey. So the woman in this painting is one of their family members? Apparently so, Madam. Madam! Madam Nadine! Where are you going with that doll? What is she doing with that doll? We're doomed. Only God determines our destiny. But we create our own fate. I've warned her. Bejo? Why'd you just pull my clothes? Ever since Eyang Marni got sick and not too many people came here, this is my second time visiting this hotel, offered her money to sell this place. But she always refused my offer. Perhaps you might be interested of selling this place to me. I'm sorry, Mr. Hong Kim. For the time being, I'm not interested in selling this hotel. I'm still grieving. I understand completely. I'm not being demanding, but maybe you don't know the history of this building. Before, this is our family's ancestral hotel. Untill one of our family's grandchildren secretly sold it. Breaking families apart. I'm hoping by buying this place, can give way out for the sake of our family unity. Just leave your number, I'll give you my decision as soon as possible. But don't put your hope too high. I am willing to buy it above market rate. Just name your price. I also want to take back our family relics. I'm sure some of them are still here. One of them is a painting. - A painting? - That's right. A painting of one of our family's grandchildren. What's with the painting? - Nadine! - Naya! Naya! Who is this? - We came on time, right? - Ben. - How are you? - Very well, I will excuse myself. I miss you so much. Rahmi, Bejo, I want you guys to meet my fiancee, Ben, and my sister, Naya. Bejo, why don't you take Naya to play outside? But don't play to far. Go play with him. I will excuse myself. Ben. How are you? Someone asked me of selling this hotel. He is willing to pay any price. He must be so eager to own it. Perhaps there's a treasure hidden in this hotel. Honey. Why don't we go out tonight? Just walk around Solo. You need to relax your mind, loosen up a little bit. Or let's play a swing with the kids. Cut it out. Don't get mad, Honey. It's my turn. One more time. I need to go to the bathroom, Naya. What happened to Naya last night? She told me... that she felt something. What do you mean? Stop it! - Help! Stop it! - Naya? Naya? Help! - Bejo! - Naya? Oh my God! Come here. Bejo, what's wrong with you? What if she falls and get hurt? - It wasn't him. - Then who is it, Naya? A little girl was pushing me. Her face scared me off. - Let's go inside. - Okay. Give me the doll. Honey, now you understand, there's a lot of weird stuff going on here. I'm sure it has something to do with Nini Thowok doll and that painting. Nini Thowok doll? "Nini Thowok, it means girl with white faces." "According to legend, Nini Thowok came from kama wurung, or from a fetus." "Kama wurung never been properly cared for." "The grave was left abandoned and never given offering." "It soon became a spirit that wanders to the sacred places, then the spirit possessed Nini Thowok doll." Do you think Mr. Hong Kim has something to do with it? I can ask information from my friend here. They must know the history of the building. At least they know. I will ask Girah and Rahmat about the woman in the painting. I'm worried about Naya. I better go. I will go home as soon as possible. - Bye. - Bye. Ben, I'm writing a book about a coffee guesthouse in Java,... one of which belongs to the Hong Kim family. I've been collecting all the data about their ancestors. His grandfather was one of the richest people in Java. He has so many mistresses. One of his mistresses was Madam Oey. Madam Oey was considered responsible for breaking Oey's big family. She inherited the coffee guesthouse as well as most of the assets that belongs to Hong Kim's grandfather. Madam Oey built Mekar Jiwo. Here's her picture. The building, not much has changed. Girah? Rahmat? Naya, go back to your room. You too, Bejo. What were you doing with them? There's something you didn't tell me. I'm sure you know something about the woman in the painting and that Nini Thowok doll inside the forbidden room! Please tell me the truth! Many weird things have been happening since I got here! The ritual is necessary. Because you have disturbed the spirit in this place. It's just a matter of time. The evil spirit will come. And if it does,... - Naya's safety... - What about it? This is her family photo. The girl who's being held, she's Madam's Oey's daughter, Yin Yin. - Now it's my turn. - Okay. And this boy, he was one of the helper's kid. Usually his duty is to accompany his master's daughter. Yin Yin? Yin Yin? Yin? Yin Yin? People say Yin Yin disappeared. Nobody knows where she is. She mysteriously disappeared for years, never been found. Madam Oey got really depressed and sad. Authorities and shamans searched hopelessly for years. But Yin Yin was nowhere to be found. Yin? Yin? Yin Yin? Yin Yin? Yin Yin. Madam Oey used Nini Thowok doll to search for her daughter. She discovered that her daughter was still in the house. Someone hid Yin Yin. So you mean, Nini Thowok located Yin Yin? Then why Madam Oey didn't tell anyone at the time? She tried, but no one believed her until she got depressed, sick, and died. But what's Naya got to do with Madam Oey? Ever since Naya came, it's awakening the dark spirit. Nadine. Help! That's why we had to do the ritual to cleanse their spirits. Maybe Madam Oey thinks that Naya is Yin Yin, her beloved daughter. Eyang Marni once said, Madam Oey did not want to be away from her child that she believed still in this house. So Madam Oey entered the painting. How old do you think the boy is if he is still alive? Around 55-60 years old. Bejo? Naya? Nadine! Push it again! - Push it again. - Help! Madam! Madam Nadine! Are you okay? Rahmat, please find my sister. Help me. Did you see it? There's a dozen of Nini Thowok came after me. I only heard you scream. I didn't see anything. - Please help me find my sister! - Sure. Push it again. Yin Yin? Yin Yin? Rahmat? Honey? What happened? Calm down. Calm down. I know what is wrong with this place. Look at these pictures. I'm sure this is Rahmat when he was little. Wait here. I will look for Rahmat. Rahmat! Rahmat! Rahmat, you have to tell us the truth. Who is the lady in the painting? You know her, right? Look at this picture. This is your picture when you were little, right? You were Yin Yin's friend. I didn't do it on purpose! You cannot hide this secret anymore. A child's life is at stake. Naya can also be missing. Girah, please help me find Naya inside the house. Ben, help me, Rahmat wont say anything. I have to call the police. Rahmat. For Naya, please tell me what happened to Yin Yin? Answer me! I didn't do it on purpose. Push higher. - Don't. - Get me higher. - Push higher. - Don't. - Push higher. - Are you sure? I'm sure. There you go. Higher. Push Push higher. Higher! Yin Yin! Yin Yin! Yin Yin! Yin Yin! Rahmat! Rahmat. Where's Yin Yin? Where's Yin Yin? Yin Yin! Yin Yin! Rahmat. Where did you hid Yin Yin's body? Where it it? - Rahmat! - Where is it? Where is it? Bejo, come here. Do you know where Naya is? Where is she? She was taken to the flea market. Flea market? What flea market? Maybe Madam Oey thinks that her daughter was buried there. Forgive me, Lord. Now let's... Where is Rahmat? Go find Rahmat. We need him to save Naya. - You have to becareful. - I will. Rahmat! Rahmat! Rahmat! Naya! Naya? Naya? Nadine! Naya? Nadine! Naya? Rahmat! Forgive me, Yin Yin! Forgive me, Yin Yin! Forgive me, Yin Yin! Naya? Naya! Naya? Madam Oey, she is not Yin Yin. She is Naya, my younger sister. Please return her to me. She didn't do anything to Yin Yin. I am responsible. For it was I who caused her death. I did it. But I swear, I didn't do it on purpose. She was thrown and died under the swing. I hid her body because I'm affraid. Forgive me! Forgive me! For years I kept this hidden. I promise, I will bury Yin Yin's body properly. Nadine! Miss Nadine, Mr. Ben, Mr. Hong Kim, the land deed will be finish in two weeks. I will look forward for that. We will excuse ourselves. Miss Nadine, Mr. Ben, once we finish renovate this place into a boutique hotel, based on your design, What's the name again? The Past Shop. Because this building is related to the past. So, please do visit us later. You guys can stay here anytime. Very well, we will excuse ourselves. Goodbye and thank you. Goodbye.
