Thank you. But you haven't worked in a while. Why are you interested in a full-time position as an art director? Um... Timing, I guess. "Timing"? What do you mean by that? Oh, thank you. Um, well, my ex-husband and I... got married right after college and moved up to the city and I worked in advertising for a few years, but when RayAnne came along, I-- oh, that's my daughter-- Oh. ...I stopped working and became a stay-at-home mom. And that's a full-time job in itself. Oh, yes, it is, and I've loved every minute of it, but Ray's growing up, and I need a job, and here I am. Well, working in a New York ad agency, the hours here can be very demanding. Oh, yes. I remember, and I'm ready for that. And do you think this is the place you want to be? I do. Good. We'll be in touch. Thank you. [♪♪♪] [distant "Santa"]: Merry Christmas! [Sydney]: Hey, Ray. We're back in Hopewell. Isn't this cute? Uh-huh. My phone's slow. Do they even have service here? You know what-- we are not that far from New York, honey. Why don't you put your phone away and enjoy where we are? Look! Look at all these amazing Christmas decorations. Look, Mom! A cookie-dough bakery! You know, my grandma used to take me there when I was your age. Wow! That's a long time ago! Yes. The dinosaurs were wearing Santa hats. [laughs] Can I go get a cookie, Mom? Please? Uh... - Okay, sure. - Yes! All right. Cookie time! How many cookies am I allowed? How many do you think? Ten? How about "ten minus nine"? One? Yes. I'd say one cookie. Oh, Merry Christmas! [Mom]: Merry Christmas. These are fresh from the oven. Would you both like to try one? For free? Of course! It's our Christmas Cookie Countdown. We're featuring a different Christmas cookie every day until Christmas. Today is "Gingerbread Manchesters." Thank you! Ooh. Thank you. Delicious! [laughing] Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Thank you. [♪♪♪] All right! There's somewhere very special I want to show you. Where is it? It is... right there. The Book Bea. I remember The Book Bea! Can we go inside? Of course! That's why we're here. You have a good memory. Yep! [laughs] [Christmas tunes play quietly on shop speakers] - It's so pretty. - Yes. Marvin, I know you are going to love this book. [Marvin chuckles] Well, if it's anything like the last one, I'm sure I will. Thank you. [♪♪♪] I don't know how she does it, but she always seems to recommend just the right book. [Bea]: Thank you, Marvin! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. Sydney? Is that you? Hi, Bea. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! I can't believe it. Let me look at you! Oh! I haven't seen you in forever. Well, it has been a few years. It seems like forever. Mm-hmm. I was sorry, dear, about your grandmother's passing. Thank you. We're staying in her house for the holiday. And this can't be RayAnne! The last time I saw you, you were this big, and now look at you! You remember Bea, honey? Um, not really. Well, Bea is the owner of "The Book... Bea." Nice to meet you. Do you have any Wi-Fi here? Uh, I'm afraid not, dear, but... I might have something even better. Mm! Come with me. So we're just going around here, okay? [♪♪♪] "The Christmas Road." Uh-huh. The best part is, the whole story is right there in your hands. You don't have to download anything. Shall we read it? Okay. [♪♪♪] Uh, excuse me! Hi. You talking to me? Yes, I'm talking to you. I've been watching you. - You've been watching me? - And I saw everything you did! You didn't pay for those books. No. No, I didn't. Wha-- Uh, Bea! Could you come here for a minute? Yes, Sydney? This man here is shoplifting. [chuckles] Oh. Hey, Mac. Hey, Bea. Oh, you two know each other. Mac is our local fourth-grade school teacher. Ah. Oh! I hope you don't mind. Uh, I grabbed this to read to the kids today. [Bea]: Great. Just take whatever you need, honey, and settle up at the end of the month as usual. Well, I was thinking about The Book Thief... for next semester. Hilarious. Not from around here, are ya? New York? Why would you say that? Mm. You seem a little tense. Mm, not tense at all. - Mm? A little bit. - Nope. Look, I don't know who you think you are, but-- Well, I am Mac. Uh, the local fourth-grade school teacher, and I have to get back to school, so, Sydney, it was nice to meet you. Bea, thank you. Bye, honey. [♪♪♪] Funny guy. [chuckles] He's wonderful. And so helpful to everybody. Well, if you say so. And cute. And... single. So you heard about my divorce. It's a small town. Well... I'm not looking for a relationship right now, Bea. Well, don't wait too long, honey. Mom! I love this book! I love it so much. It's about a girl, and she goes on a trip at Christmas. She's exactly like me! Imagine that. Well, we might just have to get it. Oh, let's consider it an early Christmas gift. Oh, Bea, you do not need to do that. Thank you so much! [Bea]: Oh! And you should come to the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony tonight. You know what? We just drove in, and I think we're a little tired. [Bea]: Everybody in town will be there. There's a Christmas tree? A big one! Well, I guess we will see you tonight. All right. Thank you. Come on, hon'. Bye! [Sydney]: This was my grandmother's house. [RayAnne]: Oh, wow. Wow. Did Great-Grandma really give you this whole house? Yes, she did. I guess she knew how much I loved it... and her. You made it! Hey... Diane! It's so good to see you. You too! I cannot thank you enough for keeping an eye on the house. What are neighbors for? Some Christmas cheer. Oh, thank you. Ray? Gosh, you are cute. How old are you now? 18? - I'm only 8! -8? Well, it just so happens that I have a daughter, too, and she is just a little older. What's her name? Sarah. [man]: Hi, Sydney! I'll have these up in no time. Todd! Hey! Wait, what-- what are you doing? I always did your Grandma's Christmas lights, remember? Yeah, actually, uh, the thing is, I, uh... I wasn't going to do lights this year. [both laughing] No Christmas lights? You're kidding, right? [Sydney chuckles awkwardly] Yeah. [laughs] Just kidding. Yeah... go ahead, you've already got it started. [Todd]: Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Don't fall off the ladder, honey. Thank you, dear. Ah. Ooh! It is chilly out here. Should we get you girls inside? - Hot chocolate? - Definitely. [RayAnne]: Wow. I really like this house, Mommy. I'm glad you do! Can I go pick out my room? - Yes. - Please? - Yes! - Thank you! [laughs] She is adorable. Yeah. I like her. So the furnace has been acting kinda funny. If you need to, just reset it. Oh, okay. Thank you. Yeah. This house brings back so many Christmas memories. I bet. I really wish I could've gotten down here more in the last years, but... you know. Life? Yeah. Life. I was sorry to hear about you and Jon. How are things, if I can ask? O...kay. He's great with RayAnne. He's taking her to Hawaii for Christmas. [♪♪♪] What about you? Oh, I'm-I'm staying here for the holiday. That's not what I meant. Yeah, I know. Uh, things have been tough, but I'm getting through it. Good. You know, if you need anything, I am... right there. - Thank you, Di. - Mm-hmm. Oh, actually, there is one thing. Could you recommend a realtor? Um... Lou Williams is good, but I don't know, I was kind of hoping maybe you guys might be moving in. [chuckles] Yeah, no. I gotta get back to the city and get a job. [Todd]: Dianne! Who could that be? I'll see you later. Ray! Have you picked out a room yet? [RayAnne]: Yeah! I did! [Sydney]: Oh, goodie! Hey. Look what I found! Grandma's ornaments. You know, she collected these for years. I wonder if she still has the one that we gave her for your first Christmas? - Is this one it? - Mm-hmm. It's really pretty. Mm-hmm. Can we hang them up on the tree? Actually, I was thinking that maybe we don't do a tree this year. Why not? Because you're going to be with your dad in Hawaii on Christmas Eve and I'm gonna be here by myself, so... So? So I was kind of looking forward to not having to put up a tree because... it is a lot of work-- you gotta put it up and then take it down, and clean up all those pine needles... And what are you going to do for Christmas instead? I don't know. Maybe I'll go on a trip. I have never been to Paris. I've always wanted to go. This could be my chance. Mom, you're not going to Paris! ...Without me. [Sydney laughs] Deal. Look. Your dad and I both love you very much, and we both agreed that you would spend half the holiday with me, and then half with him. So you're going to get to go Hawaii, and you're going to have so much fun, and then you're gonna come back and you're gonna tell me all about it, okay? Okay. I love you, Mom. I love you, too. What do you say we go get the bags out of the car and then we come back in and we get ready to go to the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony, huh? Deal. Okay. Come on. [school bell ringing] I never thought 3:00 would get here. Why does the day before Christmas break always seem to last forever? I know! Do you have any plans for the holidays, Kenny? What, me? Yeah, you know. A little of this, a little of that. Very mysterious. Mm. How 'bout you? I am looking forward to two weeks of peace and quiet, and finally getting started on my new novel. I thought you were working on that last summer? Oh... kinda. You mean you still haven't started? Oh, I know, I know. I get writer's block, something I'm hoping I get over this holiday. Well, good luck. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hey, Bea. Oh, hey, Mac. I finished the holiday reading list for the kids in my class. Great! Some of 'em might be coming in over Christmas. It'd be great if you could point 'em to the right books. Of course. Happy to help. Oh! Sydney has a daughter the same age as the children in your class. - Who? - Sydney? The lovely young woman you met earlier... the one who thought you were shoplifting. Oh! Right. How could I forget? She's spending Christmas here in town. And...? She's single. [chuckles] Yeah. Bea... I told you, I'm not... I'm not looking to get involved with anybody. Yet. "Yet"? You're not trying to get involved with anybody yet. You never know. She might be the one. Yeah, she might be. Bea, I love you. I got to go. Yeah. A-Are you going to the tree-lighting ceremony tonight? I hadn't planned on it. Oh. Oh. Okay, well, n-never mind. I'm sure I'll be fine. What do you mean, you're sure you'll be fine? I want to go, of course, but it will be... dark and... cold and... I-- I'll be all alone, and with the sidewalks being icy, a-and, a-at my age, you just never know what could happen. No. I-I will just miss this year. Unless... Unless? ...I could find somebody to go with me? Mm. [Mac inhales deeply, sighs] What time am I picking you up? [Bea chuckles] 6:00? Okay. I'll see you at 6:00.

Not guilty. I'm Mac. What's your name? RayAnne. Well, nice to meet you, RayAnne. Nice to meet you too, Mac. Isn't this a coincidence? Yeah. [♪♪♪] Hello, everybody, and merry Christmas. [townsfolk]: Merry Christmas! Welcome to the 66th Annual Hopewell Christmas Tree-Lighting Extravaganza! [applauding and cheering] Now, as many of you may have heard, this will be my final Christmas as your mayor. - Aw! - Boo. Now, I have loved every minute of it, but it's time for me to step aside and welcome some fresh faces. So, I'm hoping everybody will join me in making this Christmas one to remember. And now, without further ado, I would like to invite one of my favorite local merchants to come on up here and help me light up our tree. Bea Beaumont... are you out there? [applause rising] Go, Bea! [Mayor]: Bea, come on up here and give me a hand, would you? [applause continues] So how do you know Bea? Oh, uh, I-I used to go to her bookstore when I was a little girl. You used to live in Hopewell? No. My grandparents did. I used to come down for Christmas, kind of a family tradition. Is that what you're doing here now? We're selling my great-grandma's house. And then I'm gonna go to Hawaii with my dad. Gonna go to Hawaii? You gonna learn how to surf? Probably. Very cool. Mom, I'm getting a bit cold. Oh, okay, honey. [Mayor]: Okay, here we go! Let's all count down. Five... [crowd joins in]: ...Four, three, two, one... [cheering erupts] - Oh! - Sorry! You okay? [♪♪♪] Yeah. So, um... it was really nice talking to you. Come, honey, we got to go home now. - What? - It's getting late. [♪♪♪] [RayAnne]: They just turned the lights on, Mom. Why do we have to leave so soon? Well, because, you know, we haven't unpacked everything, and it's our first night in the house, and I thought we should get back to the place. [ignition sputtering] Oh... [sputtering continues] And the car's not starting. Hmm. [knocks] Oh... You dropped this. Oh! Thank you. Appreciate it. Our car won't start, Mac. Oh? Uh, it's probably just cold... We're fine. Well, pop the hood. I'll take a look. Oh, no, you don't need to. Thanks, though. Please, Mom? Really, it's nothing. Uh... [hood pops open] Well... looks like it's your... fuel pump. The garage can fix it, but they won't be open till the morning. Okay, well, thank you. I think I'll just call an Uber. Thanks. [amused]: In Hopewell? Good luck with that. Let me get my truck. I'll give you a ride home. No, you really don't need to. You've already done enough. I don't want you to drive out of your way. We're up on Pine, by the park. Is that the red house with the yellow trim? You know it? Well, yeah, my sister lives next door. You're Diane's brother? [laughs] Yeah. Small world, huh? Small world. Mom, it's getting cold in here. [Mac]: Well? How about that ride? Thank you. Okay, hon'. [♪♪♪] [Sydney]: Thanks for the ride. Yeah. Any time. [RayAnne]: It's freezing in our house! Can you fix the heater, Mac? [Mac]: Yeah, sure. I'll take a look. Huh. Thermostat's busted. Yeah, we've been having trouble with the furnace. It doesn't seem to be keeping the place very warm. Well, I can take a look. Oh. Uh... sure. If you don't mind. Not at all. Didn't drive you all the way out here just to have you freeze. [laughs] Thanks. Yeah. The furnace is just through the door, down there. I'm gonna run upstairs and check on Ray. - Okay, thanks. - Yeah. Sure. Ray! It's time for bed. Uh-uh-uh. Straight to bed, honey. Can I just read? It is getting late. Ten minutes? Five minutes. Okay. Can you say goodnight to Mac for me? Of course. Thanks. I love you, Mom. I love you. Goodnight. Thanks. Wait! Maybe kiss me two more times, because three times is a charm. [Sydney laughs] Mwah! Mwa-a-ah. There! All right. Bed. [♪♪♪] Thank you again for fixing the furnace. Yeah, no problem. It is an old system, though, so when you get a chance, you should replace it. Oh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Mm. That's really good. - So, listen, I-- - I wanted-- [both chuckling] Please. You first. I just wanted to apologize for running away from you at the tree ceremony... It was kind of rude. Ah. Don't worry about it. I just haven't been out much since my divorce, much less been set up by anyone, so... I guess I forgot how to act in public. Yeah, well, Bea's a really sweet lady, but she doesn't seem to like the idea of anybody being single. Yeah! What is with that? I've only been divorced a year and, already, everybody want me to get married again. Well, I don't know about you, but I like being single. So do I! You can do whatever you want. Whenever you want. And you don't have to have some big discussion about what movie to go see. Exactly. Or what toppings you want to put on your pizza. And if you want to wake up in the middle of the night and dance around in the living room to your favorite song, you can. Yes, you can. You can do that. Yeah. Yeah. It's good to be alone. Yeah, it is... it is good to be... Do you do that? What? Dance around in the middle of the night in your living room? Sometimes. Yeah. Why are you looking at me like that? Nothing, nothing. So do I. - No, you don't. - No, you're right, I don't. I don't, but I could. Yeah, I'd like to see that. Cheers. - Cheers. - [clack] [♪♪♪] Thinking of decorating a tree for Christmas? Oh. Well... um... Better hurry. Christmas is only two weeks away. Why don't you keep that one? Really? Yeah. It's the season of giving-- and receiving. Think of it as a little "thank you" gift. Thank you. Thank you... for everything. Have a good night. Good night. Oh, I've got the door. [♪♪♪] That's silly. [♪♪♪] "Single is great. "You can put whatever you want on your pizza... "You can dance around in the middle... "of the night, like a crazy person..." "...Says Mac." Pretty slick. [scoffs lightly] [sighs] [exhales] [♪♪♪] Let's try... Much better. [♪♪♪] Come on, Bea. At least think it over. It's a Hopewell tradition. Oh, good morning, Sydney. Morning RayAnne. Hi, Bea! I love The Christmas Road and I'm almost finished it! You are? Yeah! And I love it so much, I'm gonna go look for another book! Okay. [chuckles] Oh! Which reminds me, Sydney-- I found something I think you might like, too. [Mayor]: Bea always knows how to pick out the right book. I am becoming a believer. Oh, Curtis, this is Elizabeth Darton's granddaughter, Sydney. And our mayor, Curtis Gray. I heard that you'd come to town. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Maybe you can help me change this lady's mind. [sighs] I've told you, Curtis. I'm just not interested this year. Interested in what? In the Christmas Carousel. What is "Christmas Carousel"? For the last 10 years, on December 23rd, the Main Street merchants have stayed open and served hot cocoa and cookies. Yeah, people stop by and admire the Christmas tree displays and get some last-minute shopping done. At the end, we judge the windows displays and we hand out a prize to the winner. Hmm. Well, that sounds lovely. It is. But it is also a lot of work. Putting up the new display, arranging snacks... I am just getting too old to do all of that alone. Too old? You? Mm. That is just ridiculous, Bea. As far as I'm concerned, you are still the same sweet, young girl that I took to the high-school prom. Are you flirting with me, Mr. Mayor? Well, duty calls. Mm-hmm. It was nice to meet you, Sydney. Nice to meet you, too. Merry Christmas. [Sydney]: Merry Christmas. Hmm! [Bea laughs] So, the truth is, I feel badly about letting everybody down about the Christmas Carousel, but running this store by myself, it's already too much. What if I help you with the store? Oh, no, I couldn't ask you to do that. Why not? I don't have anything else going on right now. I could help you with... whatever you need. Well... but I would have to pay you. Oh, well, that's not necessary. Yes, it is. What's fair is fair, and those car repair of yours are not gonna be cheap. Mac told me all about it. So? Well, if you insist. - Deal! - Deal. [Bea laughs] Good! The first thing we'll need is a Christmas tree. I know just the place. [Bea gasps theatrically] [♪♪♪] [chainsaw roars] [Mac]: Look out! Oh! [Mac]: Oh, I'm so sorry! Don't try to get up too fast, okay? You all right? Uh, yeah, I'm fine, I think. You look all right. Just a little... Mucky. [Mac chuckles] Thanks. Whew. - Oh, thanks. - Yeah. [Sydney, grunts]: Oh... Thank you. Yeah. Uh, what-- what are you doing here? I thought you were a teacher? I am. Diane and Todd own the tree farm. I help 'em out during the busy season. Oh! What are you doing here? Um, I am buying a tree for The Book Bea. I'm kind of working there now. Yeah? So maybe Hopewell thing isn't so temporary after all? Oh, no, it's just a part-time thing, a little fun for the holidays, before I head back to the city after Christmas. Right. Hopewell's probably a little slow for somebody like you. What? Someone like me? Yeah, a glamorous city gal. You got to get back to the fast lane, huh? Oh, yeah, that's me. Living the high life... Bars. Restaurants. - Nightclubs? - Yeah, totally. [Mac chuckling] So you two know each other? - Oh, hey! - Hi. Uh, yeah, he fixed my furnace. Hmm! I had no idea you knew how to do something like that. Well, just because you're my sister, doesn't mean you know everything. So, can I help you find a tree? Uh, I think a tree found me. [Mac laughs] [Sydney]: All right. Just... Just up here. [Mac]: Thanks. Well, thank you! - Yeah. - I appreciate it. Okay. Whew! All right. [grunts] Okay, let's put-- just maybe up a little bit more? - Okay. - Perfect! Yeah? See? That wasn't that hard. Well, that's easy for you to say. You didn't have to carry the tree. Oh, well, I'm brains and beauty. Brawn is your department. Well, happy to be of service. No, seriously, thank you, I appreciate it. You're very welcome. [cell rings] Oh. Oh, Sydney, I'm sorry. I got to go. What? What's up? I'll tell you later. [mutters]: Uh... okay. [♪♪♪] Mr. Howell! I'm so glad you're here. Is everything okay? It's an emergency. This way. He was walking up the Candy Cane Stairs to get to the Christmas Throne when he slipped on a gingerbread man and fell off the back of Santa's Workshop. This... This-- This is what you meant when you said you had "a little of this and a little of that" to do over the holidays? Well, Santa's pretty busy this time of year, so some of us get together and try to help him out. You know... talk to the kids, get their Christmas wishes, that kind of thing. How bad is it? Let's just say I won't be making many trips to the North Pole any time soon. [chuckles] Mac... I need your help. Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Kenny, you can't be asking me to... Mac, you're the only other guy I know who has nothing else going on at Christmas. You've got the time! And you're great with kids. Yeah, but I don't know how to do that! What am I gonna do? I don't know what to do! Mac. Don't do it for me. Do it... for Christmas. [♪♪♪] [sighing] ♪ Christmas bells Are jingling ♪ ♪ All through the town tonight ♪ ♪ The children All are singing ♪ ♪ Oh, so merrily and bright ♪ [doorbell jingles] ♪ Christmas carols ringing out ♪ Wow! The tree looks beautiful. Oh! Hello. Thank you. It has been a group effort. Sarah, you remember RayAnne and her Ms. Ragsdale? Hi, Sarah. Nice to see you. Hello. [whispers]: She's a little shy. Do you want to go look at some books with me? Okay! Okay! Bye, honey. Well, she was a little shy. [Sydney laughs] That is the thing that I just love about The Book Bea. There's just something about it that brings everyone together. I still have a few trees left at the lot. Should I save one for you and Ray? Oh... I'm not doing a Christmas tree this year. You sound just like my brother. He's not doing one either? Christmas is a difficult time of year for him. Oh... Why is that? It's not really my place to say. Oh... Gotcha. Can I ask you a big favor? Sure. Would you watch Sarah while I go do-- - ...Some Christmas shopping? - Of course. Oh. You're a doll. Thank you. Bye, honey! Those girls are getting on like a house on fire. [chuckles] That reminds me... I have been thinking that we need to start a book club here at the store. A book club? Yes. For the kids during the holiday. We clear a bit of space in the back, and we put in comfy chairs and pillows, and serve hot chocolate. Well, Mac gave me a list of books he wanted his students to read over the holidays. W-We could start there? Yes. Perfect. And then I was thinking I'd talk to Marnie over at The Cookie Dough Bakery and see if she wanted to sell cookies here. And then we could put some books up in a display at her bakery, and start it all during the Carousel. I have not made up my mind about the Christmas Carousel, Sydney, but I love the way you're trying to talk me into it. I am not trying to talk you into anything. I just really want to do what is best for the store. And I appreciate it. You have such a passion for the Book Bea. I'm just sorry you're not going to be here after Christmas. [♪♪♪] Look, kids! Santa's here. [Mac, deep voice]: Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! - cheering] - Yay! Santa! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [♪♪♪] Thanks again, Sydney. I owe you. If you need anyone to look after Ray, just let me know. Thank you. I appreciate that. Bye, Sarah. Bye, Ray. So cute! I know. Right? Let's go, you. Bye, ladies. Mom, can I go to Santa's Village? Of course you can. I'll be right behind you. But first, let's get a jacket on you. Okay. [♪♪♪] First-timer? Yeah. I just moved here. Well, welcome to Hopewell! Thank you. What's your name? RayAnne. Pretty name. I'm Twinkle-Toes. [whispers]: But my real name's Hannah. [RayAnne chuckles] Good news, RayAnne! You just so happen to be on Santa's "nice" list this year. Just wait a little longer, and then it'll be your turn, okay? Okay. [♪♪♪] Up you go! And who do we have here? [Twinkle Toes]: Santa, this is RayAnne. She's new to town. Well, hi, RayAnne. I know you're not the real Santa. You're one of his helpers, right? - Um... - It's okay, I get it. He's a busy man. But can you do me a favor and send him a message, please? [♪♪♪] You, uh, you want me to ask him for something special for Christmas? Actually, it's not really for me. It's for my mom. For your mom? I suppose that would be all right. She's been really sad ever since the divorce, so all I want for Christmas this year is for her to be happy again. I see. She's trying to pretend everything's okay, but I can tell she's not happy. - You can? - Uh-huh. We're not even getting a Christmas tree this year. Ugh! Well, that's awful. I know! So, if there's anything Santa can do to help, that's really all I need. Well... I will make sure he gets your message. Merry Christmas, RayAnne. Thanks. Merry Christmas. [RayAnne smooches Santa] [♪♪♪] So? What'd you ask Santa for? I can't tell you. It's a secret. [♪♪♪] [RayAnne]: ...And I made a new friend. Her name's Sarah. She's a couple years older than me and we like the same books and everything. Oh, and we put up this big tree in front of the window and-- [Dad, Jon]: Ray, I want to hear all about it, but I can't talk right now. Mm-hmm. I'll call you again before I see you, and you can tell me all about it then. Okay. Sure, Daddy. - I love you, sweetie. - See you soon. I love you, too. Bye. - Bye. - [beep] Is everything okay, honey? Oh. Uh... Yeah, everything's okay, Mom. Dad said he's gonna pick me up Christmas Eve morning. Well, that's pretty exciting. Going to Hawaii? Yeah, I guess. What's wrong? Nothing. It's just... I'm really starting to like Hopewell. Me too! Are you sure you're going to be okay, being all alone at Christmas? [sets cup down] I love you so much. [smooch] And yes, I will be okay. Diane's invited me over for Christmas dinner. So you get to spend Christmas with my new friend, Sarah? Yes, I do. And you are going to have so much fun. I am pretty excited. [doorbell chimes] Hi. Hi... I was, uh, I was just delivering Christmas trees in your neighborhood and I had an extra one, and was wondering if maybe you wanted to take it off my hands? Oh, wow. Um... [shrieking]: A Christmas tree! Mommy, please? Yes. I would love to take that Christmas tree off your hands. - All right. - Come on in. Sure. Comin' in! Yup! It is! Okay. A little to the left. Uh, your other left. Yep! Knew that. [laughs] You're a school teacher, right? Yeah... Okay. Back... Okay. Perfect! You're good at this. - Pretty good. - Yeah. Team effort. [both chuckle] Mostly you. [Mac laughs] Got the ornaments! Oh! Oh, honey-- - Okay-- - Honey, that is a great idea... Except for the fact that I'm not sure that Mac can stick around and decorate a whole Christmas tree right now. Yeah, I should probably be getting home. Can we just make him hot chocolate? I'm sure you want hot chocolate. Please? I want hot chocolate. All right. I told ya! Hot chocolate, coming right up. [RayAnne giggles] [Mac]: All right. Did you know... that the order that you put your decorations up on your Christmas tree tells a lot about your character? Really? Nope. Totally made that up right now.

Hey, you know what I just remembered? Tomorrow, there's gonna be a big Christmas gingerbread house competition-- - ...At the church. - Whoa! What's that? Well, it's where everybody gets together and they make gingerbread houses, and the best one wins a prize. That sounds pretty fun, honey. Are you gonna go? [Mac]: Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm gonna go. I think everybody's gonna go. Maybe I'll even see you two there. It's a date! I mean... not a date. Of course. We will be there. - Yeah. - More hot chocolate? Yes! Definitely! And whipped cream! Well, thank you for bringing the tree. And decorating it. Of course. I had a great time. Me too. Don't forget about the gingerbread house competition tomorrow. I hear the first prize is a giant box of cookies. Oh, great, just what she needs-- more sugar. I know. [laughs] Have a good night. You too. Yeah. All right. Okay, it is someone's bedtime. Do you like the tree, Mom? It's a beautiful tree, honey. Does it make you happy? Uh, yeah. Yeah, it does make me happy. [hushed]: Thank you, Santa. Um, all right, well, let's go on up, huh? Okay. [♪♪♪] [keys clacking] Merry Christmas. Oh! I could not put this down. I'm almost finished. I'm so glad you're enjoying the book, dear. I-It's like James Howell wrote it just for me. He completely understands human nature and everything we go through, and he writes about it in such an entertaining way. Did he write anything else I could read? I'm afraid not, dear. He only wrote the one book, and that was that. How do you do it, Bea? How do you always pick the right book? [chuckles] I guess you could call it a gift. Maybe you'll learn how to do it one day. Oh, would you mind restocking these for me? Oh. Sure. Of course. [♪♪♪] What's this for? This is a bribe. To try to get you to change your mind about the Christmas Carousel. - Curtis. - Now, I know what you said-- ...But just hear me out, okay? Yes, Curtis. Now, this is my last Carousel as Mayor, and it means a lot to me-- We'll do it. ...But it just wouldn't be the same without The Book Bea, or without you. Wait, what did you say? I said yes. We'll do it. - You will? - Sure. Sydney has some great ideas. What about it, Syd? Are you up for the challenge? Absolutely. We are going to make this Christmas Carousel the best Hopewell's ever seen. Okay, we will talk about the details later, but right now, I have to get back to the Church. I'm judging the gingerbread house-building contest. But you... you have made my Christmas. Thank you... Thank you. Well, aren't those some beautiful flowers? Yes, they are. Um, speaking of the gingerbread house-building contest, I was wondering if I could slip out early? I was gonna go with Ray and meet Mac there. I think that's a great idea. Thank you. [♪♪♪] ♪ Ooh, Christmastime ♪ ♪ This is Christmastime ♪ ♪ Ooh...

No. I mean, not-not exactly, [hushed]: He told me about the Christmas tree... and you. Well, there's not much to tell. We just both said that we'd see each other here, so... Sure. I get it. We don't really know each other. Well, that's perfect. There's no better time to get to know someone than Christmas. That's what my grandmother always used to say. She was right. [♪♪♪] Excuse me. Oh! Pardon! Merry Christmas! And the winner of this year's gingerbread house contest is... ...RayAnne Ragsdale! [RayAnne squeals] [crowd applauding] [♪♪♪] Cookies! [Sydney]: Oh, ho! - A lot of them! - I know! Good for you, honey! [indistinct chatter] [♪♪♪] You just missed her. I don't know what you're talking about. You know exactly who I'm talking about. [sighing] [♪♪♪] All right, so, do you want one of your cookies before bed? No, I think I'm going to save them for the book club. Oh, that is the sweetest thing ever. I mean, it's Christmas, Mom. Mom? Why didn't Mac come tonight? I don't-- I don't know, honey. He said he was going to be there. Yes, he did, and I know you were looking forward to seeing him. So were you. Yes, I was, but... I am sure he had a very good reason for not showing up. He better! Yes, he better! Now off to bed with you. Okay. But, Mom? Can you come snuggle me goodnight? I would love that. Snuggle-monster coming! [RayAnne shrieks] [♪♪♪] Love you, angel. [♪♪♪] [Lou]: Well, as a real estate professional, I got to be honest with you. If you want top dollar, uh, the place is gonna need some work. Those eaves out front are probably rotted. When I was a kid, I used to lay in bed and watch the icicles melt off of them. [chuckles] Yeah, well, they got to go. [Sydney]: Could you recommend a contractor? Yeah, yeah. I can recommend quite a few guys, actually. - Oh... - [step creaks] Creaky step here. [creaking] Oh, yeah, that's how you knew if someone was coming downstairs, so, if you were sneaking a Christmas cookie, you could put the lid back on before you got caught. [laughs] That's a great story, but still needs to be fixed, though. Yes. Well, thank you so much for coming out here. I will think about everything you said and give you a call later. Well, it's my pleasure, Ms. Ragsdale. And, uh, remember, when you're ready to sell, you can always count on Williams Real Estate to get you the best price. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Here's my card. Oh, and, uh, I will email you the numbers of those contractors. - Oh, great. - Yeah. [♪♪♪] Hi, Helper Santa. Remember me? [Mac]: I sure do, RayAnne. What brings you back? I just wanted to thank you for getting Mr. Mac to bring us that Christmas tree. Oh, he did? Did it make your mom feel better? For a while. But she was sad again last night. Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. That's okay, it wasn't your fault. Well, is there something I can do to make it better? Hmm. Well, she's always wanted to go to Paris. Oh... [chuckles] Paris might be a little out of my budget range. But you work for Santa Claus, remember? You could do anything. [♪♪♪] Hmm. You know... you're right. [♪♪♪] ♪ Maybe it's the frost on my window... ♪ Hi. Can I-- Hi... Hi. Listen, I'm really sorry about last night. I-I tried to get there on time, but something came up, and... Don't worry about it. I did worry about it, though. Was kinda hoping maybe you'd let me make it up to you, take you out to dinner? You know, I'm closing up here, and I've got to go pick up Ray, so-- Well, I already spoke with Diane. Uh, she and Sarah are gonna make Christmas decorations at your house with Ray. Ray should have texted you. Oh... Oh. Yeah, let me just text her back. So? What do you say? Let me go get my jacket. [♪♪♪] [accordion music playing] [♪♪♪] C'est fini? That was amazing. Merci. French Christmas dinner. Special for the lady. Thank you. Oh, don't thank me. It's was Mac's idea. Thanks. Christofe's an old friend. I teach his son at school. Wow. Well, you really thought of everything. I mean, even the accordion player? Ahh. But wait, it gets better. Ahh... Père Noel. Mm-hmm. Merry Christmas. Why are you doing this, Mac? Oh, I told you, I wanted to take you out to dinner. Yeah, but why all of this? I mean, French dinner, French music... French Santa? What? You don't like it? I love it. It's just, it's kinda weird, 'cause I've always wanted to spend Christmas in Paris, so. Well, here's to dinner in Paris... Hopewell-style. Now, la bûche de Noel. Is that a chocolate log? - Yes. - Oui. Originally from France. Would you like a piece? Yes, please. Who knew the chocolate log was from France? Everybody knew that, right, Christofe? Oui, everybody. Well, I didn't know. You should do your homework... - Bon appetit. - Thank you. ...Teacher. How long have you been teaching? About two years. Actually... I started off as a writer. Really? Mm-hmm. I was gonna write the Great American Novel. Or so I thought. But, uh, when it was finally published, everybody else didn't think it was so great. Well, you didn't let that stop you? I had some... life stuff happen. I've had writer's block ever since. "Life stuff"? I was married once. Oh? Catherine and I dated all through high school, and then we got married right out of college. And then she got sick. [quietly]: Then... two Christmases ago, she was gone. Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry, Mac. Thank you. When she died... It was like hitting a brick wall. I-I couldn't even get out of bed for months. Hence the writer's block? Yeah, I quit writing, moved back here, took a teaching job, and here we are. Here we are. I don't want to live in the past anymore. [sighs] Neither do I. Catherine taught me that life is short, and you should be grateful for every moment that you have, and right now, I am grateful. You've inspired me. I inspired you? To start writing again. You're my muse. Wow. No one has ever called me their muse before, so... thank you. Thank you. [clink] Thank you for today. I had a really nice time. So, you forgive me for not showing up to the gingerbread house competition? Yes. Although Ray may take some more work. Seriously? No. [chuckles] But really, I did have a nice time, and here's my car, so... Uh, it's getting late. Yeah. [car alarm starts blaring] [Mac]: What did we do? [both laughing as alarm shuts off] Well, uh, that is one way to kill the moment. I guess that's my cue to go home. Yeah. Thank you again for the best French Christmas meal I've ever had. Well, almost like being in Paris. Almost. Maybe we'll get to go there for real. Maybe so. Listen, Syd-- [stammers] I-I, look, I haven't done this sort of thing in a long time... but, uh... there's a Christmas Carol sing-along at the church on Friday night. Maybe you and Ray want to go with me? That sounds lovely. But... But? Can I count on you to show up? Yes. I promise. I will hold you to that. Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Bye. [engine turns over] [indistinct exchange with Diane and the kids] [girls giggling] [cell phone begins ringing] Hello? Hello, Sydney? Hi. This is Clare from AJF Advertising. I apologize for calling you so late, but I wanted to let you know, that we have discussed it internally and, if the Board approves, we would like to offer you the position of Associate Art Director. [girls giggling] Well, Sydney? What do you say? [bell jingles] Bye, Mom! Hey. Hey! Promise me that you'll be good for Bea, okay? And I'll be back as soon as I can. Don't worry, Mom. I got Book Club! Okay. [book club kids]: Hi! [smack] Ms. Ragsdale, nice to see you. Nice to see you. Hey, have you had any further thoughts on selling your place? I am still thinking. Okay. Well, you've got my number. Thank you. [bell jingles] Bea, thank you so much for looking after Ray today. Hmm? Is something wrong? Well, I was trying to keep it a secret, but I might as well let you know. This is going to be my last Christmas at The Book Bea. What do you mean? Well, I have had a lot of fun running this store, but every good book must come to an end. It's time for me to retire, Sydney. Wait, you're-you're selling The Book Bea? I told Lou I wanted him to find someone who would keep the bookstore open, but he says they'll probably tear it down and build condos. No, you can't let them tear down The Book Bea. Everybody loves this place. But nobody wants to buy it. Lou says it's progress. [♪♪♪] Hey. You're right on time. For what? The inaugural meeting of the Kids' Book Club. - Oh. - I hear they're having-- ...A very special guest speaker today. Oh? Who could that be? I think it's their very favorite elementary school teacher. Right. I heard about him. I heard that he's quite charming and loves French food. Mm. But... I am headed to the city to run some errands. The city? And leave all this behind? Just a joke. This'll still be here when you get back. So will I. Okay, well, I should get going, but I will be back in time tonight for the sing-along. That a promise? Oh, it's a date. [♪♪♪] I appreciate you coming in today, Sydney. Now, this is strictly a formality. All you have to do is just be yourself and the job is yours. Here we go. Good afternoon, everyone. May I introduce Sydney Ragsdale? [♪♪♪] [organ music playing] [hushed conversations] There he is. Hey. Come on in. [♪♪♪] Hey. Can I join you? Of course, Mr. Mac. Thanks. Merry Christmas. Thank you. You too. Is Sydney here? Not yet. Do you two have plans? We have a date. You made it. - Hi. - Hi, Mom! Hey, honey. [♪♪♪] Merry Christmas, everybody. [congregation]: Merry Christmas! [Reverend]: Thank you. I hope you're ready to sing your hearts out, because we have a full program tonight. - [organ music rises] - So, without further ado, I would like you all to stand and join me in singing the first hymn of the evening, which is my personal favorite, "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing." ♪ "Hark," the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ "Glory to the newborn King!" ♪ [indistinct quiet chatter] So, how was New York? Oh, you know. Crowded, noisy... even Santa was stressed. [Mac chuckles] Well, you get all your errands done anyway? Actually, I didn't go to the city to run errands. I went to interview for a new job. Oh? For a big ad agency. They wanted me to meet the board of directors. And? I got the job. [quiet chuckle] Wow. That's, uh, that's good. Right? I think so. I mean, I have this amazing career opportunity. But... it is back in New York. So... how soon would you have to leave? Right after Christmas. Soon. Well, I wouldn't, uh... blame you if you took the job. I mean, Hopewell can't compete with New York. Don't say that. Why not? It's the truth, No, it's not. You know, I came to Hopewell for the holidays... ...but this place, these people... you... It all makes it... hard to leave. So don't. Stay. I should go. Ray's probably wondering where I am. Yep. [♪♪♪] [passerby]: Merry Christmas! Oh! Merry Christmas! [gasps softly] [sighs heavily [cell phone ringing] Hi, Bea. Morning, dear. Uh, we have a bit of a problem at The Book Bea. What's wrong? It's our Christmas tree. I'm afraid it's had an accident. [Sydney]: I'll be right over. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Oh, Bea... I am so sorry. Well, it's an old tree stand. I've had it for years. I guess it finally just gave up the ghost. Well, maybe we can make this work. [Sydney grunts] Maybe not. [tree rustles and ornaments clatter] The Christmas Carousel is tonight. We'll never be ready in time. [sighs] Yes, we will. - What? - We will come up with something. [♪♪♪] [thumps roof] [cell rings] Hey. [Sydney]: Hey, Mac. I'm in desperate need of a tree. The one at The Book Bea had an accident. Oh, Sydney, I wish I could help you. I just-- I sold the last one. What happened to the one I gave you? Yeah, it's really nice. It's just I don't think it's big enough for The Book Bea window, and the Christmas Carousel's tonight. We have to come up with something special, something unique. [Mac]: I really wish I could help. I just don't have anything left. Oh... wait. Mac, I've got to go. I've got to call an emergency meeting of The Book Club.

What's wrong, honey? Everything. "Everything"? [chuckles] I don't understand! I thought you were having so much fun with all your friends in Book Club. I am. I'm having lots of fun. Well, then, why are you so sad? I'm not really sad, it's just... going to Hawaii for Christmas seems amazing, and I do really want to surf, but... I want to stay in Hopewell for Christmas. I want to stay with all my friends. That is totally fine! Your daddy and I want you to do what you want to do. But I don't want to hurt Dad's feelings. Oh, sweetheart, you're not gonna hurt his feelings. Daddy wants you to be happy and so do I. Are you sure I won't hurt Daddy's feelings? I am positive. I just want to stay here with you. Well, then that is what we are gonna do. Do you wanna go back to The Book Bea with me? Yeah. Do you wanna race me? Yeah! I'm gonna win! [♪♪♪] Merry Christmas, Mr. Mayor, Judges. Ah, Merry Christmas, Marnie. It's a lovely display. Oh, thank you. Could I offer you any cookies? No, we can't accept gifts during the competition. Ah, well... afterwards, then. We'll be back. [♪♪♪] Evening, Bea. Mayor. I thought you said you were participating in this year's Christmas Carousel competition. Well, we had a little accident, Mayor. [Sydney]: Our display was ruined... and we had to improvise. So... We came up with something... rather unique. [♪♪♪] [exclaiming and applauding] It's wonderful! [chuckles] Merry Christmas, Bea. Merry Christmas, Curtis. [♪♪♪] The book tree's a pretty clever idea. Well, thank you. Did you make up your mind about the new job in New York? I don't know, Christmas in Hopewell is making it pretty tough to choose. Listen, Sydney-- [Kenny]: Hey, Santa! [Mac]: Hey, hi. Uh, Sydney, I don't know if two have met. Kenny works with me at the school. Oh! Nice to meet you. You too. He's quite a guy, this Mac. Anybody else would've just said no, but this guy just jumped in and took over for me. Took over what? [Kenny]: Oh, you didn't tell her? He's doing Santa duty for me over at Santa's Village. He's doing a great job, too. All the kids love him. I think he's one of the best Helper Santas we've ever had. Anyways, nice to meet you. Merry Christmas! Oh! Uh... [chuckles] Okay, look, before you say anything-- Are you the Santa Ray talked to? Yeah. So you're the Santa she asked to "help make Mom happy" for Christmas? Sydney... That's what this has all been about? The Christmas tree, dinner in Paris-- all because you felt sorry for me? Hey, it's not like that. I am such a fool. I can't believe I trusted you. But you can trust me. No, I can't, because you didn't tell me the truth. I'm sorry. Okay? I... [sighs] I just wanted to make you happy. I've already had my heart broken once, Mac, and it took every last bit of strength I have to recover from it. And I'm not gonna risk having my heart broken again. Sydney, wait. Goodbye, Mac. [♪♪♪] Merry Christmas! [♪♪♪] Thank you so much. Merry Christmas. Are you sure the buyers can't guarantee to keep the store open? No, as I mentioned, they're gonna tear down the store to build condos. Bea, it's gonna be fantastic. I appreciate your enthusiasm Lou. You know, we haven't signed the agreement yet. Bea, with the money they're offering you, you'd be a fool not to. I'll look over some things for you... Sydney! Susan! Hi. That book you recommended? The one you said you thought was just right for me? I loved it. I read the whole thing through, cover to cover. I couldn't sleep until I finished it. Oh! I'm so pleased to hear that. [Susan]: How did you do that? How did you know to choose the right book for me? I guess you could call it a gift. [Susan]: What else can you recommend? Have you read Christmas Joy by Nancy Naigle? Thank you so much. Okay, Bea, I just need you to sign here... and here... and we can put this deal to bed. My client wants to, uh, deposit funds into escrow before the end of the day. It's a pretty good Christmas present, huh? [soft chuckle] Well, if you're sure there are no other buyers... Wait! I'm the buyer. You what? You know how much I've always loved The Book Bea. It's the best place I've ever worked in my life. And Ray adores it here. Bea... the bank is offering full price and paying cash. I... I can't offer you that. But I do have a little nest egg saved up, and I could pay you a down payment, and the rest I could pay overtime, with interest, of course. And it'll be like we're a partnership, and it'll still be a bookstore with your name on it. Oh, wait, w-wait, wait a minute. What-- What's going on? I think it'll be great. I can just feel it. I mean, look around! We can do this, Bea. Bea... you're-- [laughs] I mean, you're not seriously considering this, are you? Just a moment. Sydney... are you sure you want to do this? Yeah, I've never been more sure about anything in my life. Bea... The choice is clear. Right? I agree. Okay. Deal. [♪♪♪] [Bea and Sydney laugh] Ah, I'm sorry, Lou. [Sydney laughs] That's okay. Congratulations, Bea. Thank you. Merry Christmas. [Bea and Sydney]: Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Sydney. [laughs] You know, it feels like, for the first time in a while, it actually will be one. [♪♪♪] So? What are you gonna do now, Bea? Hmm, well, I think I've seen enough of Hopewell for now. I used to be quite the traveler. You never really get that out of your system. I think maybe it's time to take another trip around the world. Ooh. Especially as I've found a new traveling companion. Our boarding passes have arrived. We take off for our group tour of Europe New Year's Eve. Mm. Will you lock up for me, dear? Of course. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [quiet realization]: "James MacLaren Howell." "Mac." [doorbell chimes] Hi. Hi... I brought your ornament back. I-I don't have a tree and you do have a tree, and I thought maybe you might want it back so you could hang it on your tree. You, uh, came all the way out here through the snow to bring me an ornament? Uh, well, it's Christmas Eve. I don't really have much else to do. [Sydney chuckles lightly] Well, come on in. It's cold. Thanks. Oh. I got that. Oh, thank you. Hmm. So, uh... - This is you? - Yeah! - Uh-huh. - Yeah, it was. Once upon a time. Where'd you find that? Bea. She didn't tell me you were the author. They say she always knows how to pick the right book. And? This wasn't just the right book. It was the perfect book. Listen, I'm, uh... I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you the truth about the whole Santa Claus thing. I wanted to. Okay? I just... I couldn't find the right time, and then so much time had passed that it felt like it was too late, and I didn't want to lose you. Thank you. For saying that. Okay. I have something to tell you. Yeah? I'm not selling this house. You're gonna stay in Hopewell? I am. Well, that might be the best Christmas present I've ever had. I could think of something better. [Ray]: Mama! Hey, Mac! Merry Christmas! Hey! Hi! I brought you something. What is it? - [gasping] - For your Christmas tree. Can we hang it up now? Yes, we can. There you go.
