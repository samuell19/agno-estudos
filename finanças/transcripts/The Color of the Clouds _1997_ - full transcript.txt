And so it happens that... ...although the paths of children... ...cross with those of adults... ...in one hundred places every day,... ...they never go in the same direction... ...nor do they even rest on the same foundations. THE COLOR OF CLOUDS A few years ago... -I can't today. -The same old story! I'm sick of it, you hear? I can't come for at least... ...two hours. We had a deal! Christ! I can't stand it when you start changing the days. You've got 20 minutes to pick up your son. -He's yours, too. -I'm stuck with him... ...all fucking week! You're a pig! A pig! Do you hear? Always fucking around, making excuses. Look, I can't do it today. Yes, you can! You've got 30 minutes. I can't make it there for another two hours. Look, I'm running out of money... ...and patience, so you fucking listen to me! He's here in the street, alone,... ...waiting for you. You can do as you want. It's up to you. Your son's in the street. Listen, Bartolomé. Dad's coming. He might be a bit late, but he's coming. All right? I have to go now. Chelo, we've been here 45 minutes. -I'm coming now. -About fucking time. Don't move from here. And don't worry, all right? That isn't your place. Go on, move over. We'll drop you at a cinema to see one of the space movies you like. When it's over, buy yourself a sandwich and wait for us. What'll you have? Nothing. I want you to do me a favor. What is it? Why did you put out the light? It was giving me a headache. We're looking for Cipriano Otero. -You know him, right? -Yes, he owns the fish farm. That's him. He's a friend of ours, of the three of us. We can't find him anywhere. Don't stare at me. That's better. We know he comes in here. -From time to time. -Yes, but he know the place. And he knows you. -What's the name? -Whose? -Yours. -Mine? Fidel. Well, Fidel. The favor is that you call Cipriano. Tell him to come here. Make up some story, but don't mention us. -Where do I call him? -Wherever you think he might be. I'm sorry, but I can't do it. We aren't close, I don't know what to say to him. Say a woman's waiting for him. He likes women, doesn't he? Say anything, but get him here. You don't want... ...to help us, do you? -It isn't that. -Give me the phone book. Play on, gentlemen. Just as if you were in your own homes. Hey, where are you going? He doesn't hear very well. Where are you going? I'm going to relieve myself, if I may. Let him go. It's the last time, I swear. I won't do it again,... ...but you must help me today. I know it isn't your day, but I can't have him today. I've changed hairdresser's and it's going fine,... ...but I've got loads of things to do and he makes it all harder. But I'm at work. So ask for time off! Is there no one else? You know I haven't got anybody. And I've got things to do. Like what? Never you mind. We'll see. Call me later. Shit! Will you do it or not? I said, call me! I don't want to hear a word, get it? I've had enough, don't push me. You can both go to hell! Fuck, Chelo, take it easy. Did I say anything? I didn't say a word. Well, don't start. So what happened? I have to call him later. Let's go to a bar. Come on, son. All right, stay there. Do whatever you fucking want! I don't believe it. Same old thing. Fuck this! Your mother's always messing me around like this. I have to go to work. So tell me, what do I do? You stay here. Your crazy mother will be here soon. Stay here and wait for her. Come on, kid. She'll be here in ten minutes, you know her. Who are you? We want to see the owner. -He hasn't been here in days. -You know where he's hiding? No, I'm just a night guard. -Let's have a talk. -But I don't know anything. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for being so punctual. The Organization for War Victims appreciates your solidarity. We will now assign all the children. Sazet Alaxus. Mr. & Mrs. Menénedez Díaz? Thank you. Ismet Alexot. Mr. & Mrs. Blanco Millán. Thank you. Samir Barloc. Miss Amparo Jiménez? Ember Anegovich. Mr. & Mrs. Gómez Navarro. Jalida Bertaselich. Mr. & Mrs. de Ripoll. Elvisa Kadich. Mr. & Mrs. Andreu? Mirza Burich. Miss Dolores Cueto. I'm Clementina Cueto. Dolores Cueto is my aunt. She's authorized me to collect the boy. Here's the letter. That's fine. Go ahead. Enesa Kurich. Mirza. Mirza. You've got a lovely name. I'm Clementina. Ti-na. Tina. Tina. That's it. I forgot. Here. May I sit down? No. Excuse me. Say what you have to say. -I already have, ma'am. -Then go away. Excuse me. Do you understand? Months ago, we began eviction procedure against you. On the basis of that,... ...the owner can turn you out... ...as you live here without paying any rent. This is very unpleasant, for you and for me. You didn't come to court,... ...or even name a lawyer. And, as was to be expected, my client won his case,... ...and I'm here to inform you. From this moment,... ... I can ask the court to proceed with the eviction. I always thought that boy was half-witted. Now I realize that he's wicked as well. I'm empowered to offer you a room in the best residential home,... ...or a sum of money, whichever you prefer. I received his citations and his threats,... ...but I thought them so despicable... ... I ignored them. There's just one truth in all this. This house has always been my family's,... ...and I have every right to live here. Our documents prove otherwise. I'm not going to argue with you or with that idiot Mateo... ...about my personal affairs. His father filled my life with joy for years. That may be the cause... ...of your client's permanent lawsuit against me. Everything else is pure lies,... ...and pure rubbish. I don't enter into such matters. I don't ask you to. Why don't you sit down? I've got nothing more to say. You want some coffee? I'll see to everything. I'll try to win you some time but it isn't up to me. They can do as they wish. Justice will win through, if there is such a thing. Good-bye, ma'am. Who is he? Mateo's lawyer. Are you all right? Yes... Yes. Forgive me. No, no, I'm fine. Don't worry. Are you really all right? -What happened? -Nothing. He told me what I knew. How long? I told him about the boy. He'll try to leave me alone for the three months he's here. Then they'll evict me. Meanwhile, we must think of something definitive. -You can't go on like this. -Are you staying? -Do you need me to stay? -No, I can sort things out. I'll show him his room. I had to buy him some clothes, he had nothing. I'm going home, Aunt. Mirza! Mirza! Good night. Catch him! We only want to talk to you. Where were you going? Help! Help! Shut up! I told you to shut up! Get inside. You shit! It's all over now. Tomorrow we'll find out what it was about. I forget to tell you where the bathroom is. It's that door. There's a toilet upstairs. Where? What did you say? Nothing. You! What's your name? Who are you? Bartolomé. -I think we have to talk. -Yes. -Are you sleepy? -Yes. Too bad. -Come down. -Yes. Put this on. Sit down. And start explaining. I told him to write his parents' names in that book, but he won't. -He's been like that all morning. -He may not have any. He must have lived with somebody. What about the house? It's bad. -What are you going to do? -I don't know. -I may be able to help you soon. -You? Yes, me. With money. I don't think it's a question of money. I mean a lot of money. No, Colo, but thank you. Take the boy with you, and see if you can talk to his parents. -Don't worry. -And the man from the fish farm? He disappeared. The police are looking for him. And for the men who were asking about him. -What's it about? -I don't know. Something nasty. -What's his name? -Baldomero. Baldomero! -You and I are leaving now. -My name's Bartolomé. All right, Bartolomé. You like it? Pick it up, if you want. I saw a boat of yours. Of course. The one Lola has. I did a good job on that. Look. One day, I'll make one similar or better. The problem is I'm running out of time. You'll have to put up with sleeping here. Unless you tell me where you come from,... ...whom we should call, and all that. Have you got parents? But you don't want to know about them. No. Did they hit you? No. Don't they love you? We'll look for a mattress. Now, listen to me. Can you whistle? Go on. It has to be loud because I don't hear very well. We'll invent something. Since you're here with me, I thought I'd ask you to help me. Anything you want. Just now, if anyone asks, say your mother is Joaquina,... ...Colo's sister,... ...the one from Los Tojos. I'll write it down so you won't forget. Don't bother. Joaquina, Colo's sister, the one from Los Tojos. Well done, Baldomero. -Bartolomé... -I'm sorry. Now I'm going to work for a while. We have to wait until dark. You can stay here, or take a walk around the port. You know what you have to say. We have to get a mattress. We have to get a mattress. I'll see to that. We were so happy we forgot about everything. We never thought that when I was left on my own,... ...your son would turn against me like he did,... ...hate me so much that he wouldn't let me live in peace. Who thought then about papers and formalities? I try to hide it,... ...but every day I'm more afraid of what lies ahead. The idea of taking in one of the war orphans from Bosnia... ...was my niece's. We thought that while I had him in the house... ...no one would dare evict me,... ...and we could look for a solution. But it all went wrong, and now I've got even more worries. I shouldn't let myself get so upset by it all. Who knows? Maybe these storm clouds will become something else. I remember what you always said. Life is a great complication which each person has to resolve. I'm doing that. I'll try to do it as best I can. You've got a call from Madrid, some organization or other. You owe me one! Pablo, I'm back. -All right. -Thanks. What are you looking for? We met the other day. We both went to open a door and you got there first. Yeah, I remember. You work for Mateo Martín, the kid. I apologized already. Why ''the kid''? To distinguish him from his father. His father was a good man, this guy's an ass. Tina! -Three of these. -Three? Hey, is he a boyfriend? Hush! Not at all! -Here you are, love. So long. -See you later. I'm here at the market by chance. My car broke down and the train isn't due yet. I was walking round and I saw you. I think you're in town to get the eviction order. -Will I tell you where the court is? -I know where it is. Why are you here? Tell me. All that your aunt told me... ...has left me a bit confused. I wanted to speak to someone who knows the story. So you didn't just happen to see me by chance. I'll be honest with you. No. -Any more lies you have to confess? -No, no. -The car really did break down. -I don't believe it. I don't even believe you brought a car. Tina! What is it? Going to Potes tomorrow? -I don't think so. -If you do, call me. Be honest again. You came to see me... ...because you think your bastard of a client may be playing dirty. You're right, but insults aren't admissible. Admissible? Wait here, don't move. These? 400. Thank you. Suddenly, you've got doubts. -Will I tell you what I think? -Can I stop you? If you hadn't seen me, you wouldn't have had scruples... ...and your conscience... ...would be easy. So you say. True or not? I'm a professional, my office deals with dozens of cases... Am I meant to faint? Please, let me finish. I studied this case with evidence and documents... ...supplied by my client, and it seemed clear. Your relative, however,... ...wouldn't speak to me, and never appeared at the hearing. Until I spoke to her the other day, I'd never even met her. And? And nothing. Thank you for coming. -How was business? -Fine. -Do you have to wait long? -About half an hour. -Want some? -No, no. -I think it's your lunch. -So what? I'll tell you what you want to know about Aunt Lola. Thank you. Then go away and leave me in peace. If, one day, you get a terrible urge to see me,... ...you seek me out and say,... ... I'm here because I want to see you or have you near. No excuses. Is that clear? Perfectly, thank you. -Want some? -No, no. Aunt Lola's family, which is my father's,... ...had an emigrant ancestor who, when he came home,... ...built a big house, with two palm trees at the entrance,... ...bought some land, and gave his heirs... ...the chance of an education. -That was back in the good days. -Then came the bad ones. Especially for Aunt Lola. She was the eldest, with lots of brothers. When my grandparents died, she was fourteen. She had to administer... ...what little was left, and began to sew for everyone. She managed to rear her brothers and give them all a trade. She worked day and night for years... ...until the men got married and gradually left home. She shut up the rooms one by one,... ...and did the accounts. The house and lands were mortgaged. She held on, selling off land, paying interminable interests. But, at the first overdue payment,... ...the banks went after her. She was about to lose everything when Mateo Martín appeared. He paid the mortgage and the interests. He became the owner of the house. He wanted to put it in her name, but she wouldn't accept it. She only let him grant her usufruct of it until her death. Did you hear me? I heard you. There's a title deed which my client has inherited,... ...but there's no other document,... ...nor is Dolores Cueto named on any of the papers. If she were, your client would have got rid of it. Why? Only he knows that. When did you leave the house? A while ago, with my father. Where do you live now? In a village in the mountains. Alone? Yes. Are you trying to chat me up? No, in all that I do, including this talk,... ...work always takes priority. What a pity! I was getting ideas. You're laughing at me. You strive to express yourself perfectly,... ...but you look at me... ...in quite another way. That's what I'm laughing at. -You're imagining it. -Sure! Anything else? When did my client's father and Doña Lola meet? They knew each other all their lives. And the reason for his generosity? The reason for his generosity was the affection between them. They had always loved each other very much. They were only twenty the first time they were separated. He and other boys from the town... ...went off to Australia to try to get ahead. She pushed him to do it,... ...and then followed his steps from a distance... ...through the long letters they exchanged regularly. Some men, like Colo, the carpenter,... ...came back over the years. Others are still there. Mateo was lucky, and by working hard... ...he prospered and made money. Suddenly, the news came that he'd got married. The letters stopped, and she had some difficult years. After some time, the man came back,... ...and set up his business near here, in the capital. A few years later, he was widowed,... ...and came back into my aunt's life. Things were explained, and from then on... ...they couldn't bear to be separated, even for a few hours. That was when he learned about the debts,... ...and the mortgage on the old house. -I've listened to you. -And what? I've listened to you. I think you're sincere. That's an admissible conclusion, sir. My name's Valerio. -All right, Valerio. -Valerio Lanza. Drop by again. I will. You wait over there. Lola! Where are you going? -What have you got there? -Here. I'm going to the capital, I'll be back late. What's taking you there? I've got things to do. I want to ask you two favors. One is that you lend me the hearing aid, and the other,... ...that you keep the boy till I come back. Is he still around? Did you speak to his parents? He doesn't have any,... ...but that's all sorted out, don't worry about it. He's with me, but I can't keep him this afternoon. Let him stay,... ...and get me the hearing aid. He's staying outside until you come back. Is that clear? You have to wait outside. If it rains, come in here. Don't take it to heart. She isn't a hard woman. The thing is, she's scared. Try not to bother her. Here. -Does it have a battery? -Of course it does. Listen to me. I've never dealt or sold... ...or touched that filth. I don't want to deal in it. You've put me on a spot, professor. Forget about it. I'll try somewhere else. -You said you found it? -Yes. Why didn't you go to the police? I've had money in my time, you know that,... ...and I never gave it much importance,... ...but now I need it. This is going to bring you problems. At this stage in my life, problems don't scare me. They amuse me. And where do I fit into all this? I have to find some of those men. And what's your idea? Look for them in bars, restaurants where people with money go. I'll spend all the time that's necessary. -Are you sure they're from here? -No. I'm sure that they're around here. Well... And afterwards? Did you hear me? Afterwards? Did you see anyone? Did you go where I said? I went, but I didn't see anything of interest. Tell me the amount. Three packs of 20 or 25 pounds each. Three packs of 25 pounds! This is madness! -I'm staying out, Colo. -I'll look somewhere else. I need to get money quickly. -How much do you need? -How much is it worth? A lot, but it won't be easy to sell it. Not for us. There's a man here,... ...dining with a pretty girl and another couple... ...at the center table. He's balding. -You know him. -To see, yes. Everyone comes here, but I don't know his name. Colo, that material... ...is top class. Did you know that? I don't care. You can do the deal if you want. Think about it. As soon as I get some money, I'll hand over the stuff. This is crazy! Fucking hell, Colo. I don't see you for years, and now this. You're crazy. You were always a crazy gypsy, professor. You! You! Bartolomé. I'm here. That old fool can't find his way back, I suppose. Come on, come inside. Give me a large loaf today. Come on. Have you got guests? -Something like that. -Well, so long. See you tomorrow. Did you request execution of the sentence? We should look at some more urgent matters. -Where do you have to do it? -In San Vicente. Go there this morning. I'd like to discuss it first. Discuss what? I sent you a report. I'd rather not say what I thought of the report. I don't understand why. I always thought you intelligent, a good professional. I was with that woman. I made some inquiries. Don't tell me about it again. Reading it turned my stomach. We should reconsider our intentions. My intentions. Of course, your intentions. Take certain things into account. Such as? The woman has lived in that house all her life. I believe your father bought the house... ...solely so that she could live there in peace. He didn't write it down,... ...but it seems certain. Go outside. She never accepted money or help from him. She's in poor health now. What's more, she's taken in a Bosnian child for three months. How can we evict her! You've been meddling in family matters which don't concern you,... ...and prying into our lives without anyone telling you to. Let me clarify something. You are Valerio Lanza,... ...you work as a lawyer and are at my service. I'm the one who pays you, and you'll do exactly as I say. That's all. Are you staying? I'll go down to see you. I'm going with him now. -Where? -Just about. That's good. But I'm relying on you. Yes. Personally I don't like secrets,... ...but you and I have one between us. -No one else can know about it. -Sure. Come and see me later. And bring him. -Do you feel all right? -Yes. How did it go? I planted the corn. Now I have to wait for it to grow. Are you coming later? Everything's going to work out. You needn't worry about a thing. I'm leaving the boy here. He takes no notice of me. To be honest, I like seeing them, and having them near. They keep me company. I'm going fishing, I'll bring you something. Are you really all right? I'm just a bit tired, thanks. -Colo... -Yes? What happened about that boy? Is he really an orphan? How often do you want to hear it? It's a long story. For the moment, he's with me. With us. Mirza had never seen the sea. -How do you know? -Because he told me. -What does he think of it? -He thinks it's very big. So do I. -Had you never seen it either? -No. Well, there it is. Excuse me. Are you here to help me or to buy? Am I in the way? Of course not. How could you be in the way? Come in. What's up? I came because I wanted to see you. Will that do? Yes. -It seems you've learned. -Tina! What are you doing here? -What about you? -I'm on duty. Hello. I'm José María. Tina. Hello, Tina. You've got a nice face. Thank you. Aren't you buying? No, I'm on duty. You've got a pretty face and a nice one. Are you on duty all day? Today I am, but I've got free time, a lot of it. Hey, stop messing around. Excuse me. -Mom says the big boss fired you. -I resigned, it's different. Well, I'm off. You two sell all you can. I wouldn't know you. -He's nice. -He's my brother. You aren't nice. He is. What does he do? He's a policeman. What's this about you being fired? From what job? I came to talk about that. As well as wanting to see me. As well as needing to see you again, of course. Look. This is where... ... I get the honey, the herbs, the fruit for the jam. It's my territory. Is it yours? Yes, it's part of my dowry. You'll see it better tomorrow. Earlier, you said I'd see everything better tomorrow. Did I say that? Yes. Why? I thought you were going to sleep here. Do you want to go? No, no. What I mean is... It's very late and I don't know the road well. There's no hotel up here. Well, then? I've got a room for you, don't worry. Or you could spend the night with me. If you want. You always seem to be making fun. It isn't very nice to be taken for a fool, you know. Take no notice of me. It's... It's my way of behaving, a form of defense. I want you to take the initiative,... ...but I always race ahead, as if I were in a hurry. Between the jokes, I try to work out what you're thinking. What am I thinking? Excuse me. What's wrong? I haven't slept since I heard Bartolomé wasn't with his father. I keep thinking about him, it's awful... Damn him anyway! You mean none of you got a look at those men's faces? No one remembers if they were blonde, dark,... ...bald, tall, small? Why not think a bit? We couldn't see. They put out the light and we were almost... ...in the dark. Where's the switch? There. That was... ...when Colo got up. You're Colo? Speak a bit louder. I got up to go to the toilet. One of them came up to me. I didn't like those men. I didn't like how they asked questions. You saw one of them up close. Yes, but I don't remember. Do you know Don Cipriano? Some more than others, but yes, I think we all know him. It's for you, Colo. It's Pedro. He's called a few times, I forgot to tell you. Any idea why they were looking for him? Or why he's disappeared? We've been asked that already. Colo, are you there? What's up? I've asked around a bit. If it seemed unpleasant before,... ...now I think it's dangerous, it isn't for us. It isn't for me, no matter how much money there is. Don't you worry. I can't even sleep. My own business is going well. I don't fucking need this! You and I haven't talked. Forget about it, you're out. Stop worrying. I'm sorry, but I don't know anything. All right? We'll talk in an hour. I'll call you. Will Colo make another boat like this? I don't know. But he made that one. Who's that? He was the man of this house. Before you two came. Why are they here? So as not to lose them. My nails are very long. Come on. -What are you doing tomorrow? -We've got a game. Will you take that to the town for me? It's finished work. The sooner it's delivered, the better. I'll tell you where. We'll do it. They want to evict me, and who knows if they'll get their way. So I have to meet my obligations. They want to evict us? Who wants to evict us? We're still here, aren't we? That's his mother. Those are his father and his brother. They're all dead now. -How do you know all this? -He tells me. -And you understand him? -More and more. It's late. Go to bed. Good night. See you tomorrow. Good night. Bartolomé! Bartolomé! -Bartolomé, you listen to me! -What's up? Your parents were on a TV program trying to find you! Why didn't you tell us the truth? I told Colo, he understood. -What did you tell Colo? -Ask him. He said your grandmother knew you were here,... ...and you had no parents. You told him that. And I saw them on television, crying. Are you going to explain? I want to go on playing with the team, they're one short. I'll go pick you up tomorrow. -We'll call them. -Who? Your parents. All right. Go on. Get out of here. What's this? Where did you get it? What are you doing? You shouldn't have... ...opened the gate. The bailiffs sealed it. They're going to change the locks. Where is she? They came to evict her. The court official from San Vicente and two other men. She stayed out here, waiting for you,... ...and then she got very ill. An ambulance took her to the hospital in Sierrallana. She told me to keep an eye out, and to look for her niece,... ...but I haven't found her yet. Colo! Colo! He isn't here. He went out. -Where did he go? -To the bar, I guess. -Can you take us to the hospital? -Which one? Sierrallana. They said it's near. -Was there an accident? -Yes. Get in. Who's that? It's you two. I'm fine. I knew that if I had to leave the house, something would happen. I might have a fit of rage. And it happened. But I'm over it now, I think. Especially now,... ...seeing you. If I could only get out of here. Wait. If you want, we can go. Get my clothes from the wardrobe. -Take this out. -How? Pull it! -Ma'am, visiting time is over. -We're leaving now, thank you. You sit up front to tell him the way. -Can he drive? -Yes. Where are we going? Home. We called the hospital, then we went over there. It was Colo's idea to come here. Just as well. Waken Mirza, and the two of you go to bed. What happened? It's all right. I'm fine, really. I'll stay a while and we'll have some coffee. As you wish. I'll make it. What's wrong? Nothing. I didn't know the boys loved her so much. She loves them too. Why are you surprised? No, it isn't that. I imagine them doing what they did, and I get emotional. Then all I can see is the bad side. They're going to come back and throw them out for good. Yes. Those three need each other,... ...but they'll have to separate. I think about it and I feel awful. You can also think that if someone really wants something,... ...he'll do anything to get it. You know that, don't you? But I don't know what they can do. You spoke to Bartolomé's parents? Yes, they'll come and get him. -Where are you going? -To say good-bye. -No, wait. -I won't be long. Come here. I've never seen you so sad. And what? Nothing. You want to cheer me up? Kiss me. That guy's called Quiroga. He was a cop for years,... ...and then he was bodyguard for bankers, important people. Now he's got a gym. That's all I know. All these years, and you've never given me one of your boats. When I get them right, I'll send you one. I don't believe it. What I'm going to tell you explains everything. Come on. What you found, the 40 pounds of drugs... Speak up a bit. It should have been burned. Drug hauls are sent straight to the oven. There are certain people in charge of doing it. One fine day, those people come to an agreement,... ...and pretend they've burned it. Either they share it out between them, or one guy takes control. They contact other mafias to get someone to shift the stuff... ...and to organize things so they can launder the money. In this case, that someone was Cipriano Otero. But he decided to hide part of the haul... ...and cheat them. -Who told you this? -A man who was important once,... ...stole what he wanted,... ...and now begs around and sells information. -It could be true. -It is. The thing is, I don't really care about the story. You're so calm it makes me want to go back into the business. I have to think. -Have you got nothing better? -No. And I'm not calm either. I just want to think. I left the car a distance away. You're such a good friend I don't deserve you. -Mateo used to say that. -Now I'm saying it. One last thing, Pedro. I'm to put my head in the lion's mouth. Get me all of Quiroga's telephone numbers. If this all works out right, you're my partner. If it goes wrong at any time, I don't even know you. -Now I'm the one who's grateful. -I don't want you to worry. Quiroga's telephone numbers. Well, professor, good luck. Be careful. I'll let you think. Why did you keep it so long? -To make money. Just for money. -And now? Now... I'll get rid of this shit and still make money. How? Using my intelligence, something we have here in the labyrinth. That's why we have it, to use it. Right, that's it. Go off and enjoy yourselves! I'm delighted you did this for the kid. It was really nice. He's thrilled with it all. Now, get out of those clothes and we'll have a drink, eh? Excuse me. Who is it? What did you say? I don't understand. Who are you? Where did you get this telephone number? The woman at your home gave it to me. I told her it was urgent. I know you're at a birthday party. I hope it's all going well. What's this about? I've got what you and your friends are looking for. What do you mean? The thing is, I want to get rid of it as soon as possible. Let's say you've got something I want. How can I be sure? I can prove it. It's a job that mustn't go wrong. It must be done well. Who's got a tide schedule? Does the money come before or after? If you want it before, it's half. We'll have it after. You can't tell us anything? Nothing. You'll each be told separately a few hours before. There's no risk involved. And it's good money. And money is happiness, isn't it? Not a word to anyone. Neither before nor after... ...the job. And no drinking for the next few days. Well? -We're here, aren't we? -Don't give us anything difficult. Don't worry. Cipriano hid the stuff... ...and tried to cheat us. But he wasn't lying when he said... ...it had disappeared. This guy found it,... ...moved it somewhere else, contacted us,... ...and wants money. How do you imagine him? He's elderly, a villager. A villager who's sharp as a razor. If he lives, he'll curse the day he found that stuff. What do we do? We have to put ourselves in his place, try to read his mind,... ...foresee everything that might happen. Why did he insist that we give him the money... ...so near the police station? -ls it a trap? -No, it isn't. It makes sense. He can check that the notes are real... ...and the amount is correct. We can't touch him, or even hurry him. He'll pay for his cockiness afterwards. But first, he'll find us there, armed and very alert. We'll block his exit routes, and finish off... ...this fucking business. -Will he bring the stuff? -I don't think so. He'll take us to it. Where's the stuff? Out there. We do as we agreed? I'll tell you where it is when I have the money. Thirty million. It's all in here. It's the most we could get. I could get five or six times as much. I know, but it would have been more difficult. My idea is to tell you the exact place. I'll wait here. You'll what? One of your men can stay with me until you pick up the stuff. There's no deal. You come with us. Don't think of escaping. You wouldn't get taking one step. Will he get in the car with the money? At that point, he's untouchable. He can't escape,... ...but he also knows we won't do anything until we get the stuff. Where to? -Take the road for Santillana. -Where? -The exact place? -Yes. What for? I'm taking you there. Isn't that what we agreed? We have to know. On the road from Comillas to Santillana, before you reach... And then you have to walk a bit, about 100 yards. I made a drawing. How's it going? Fine, but you have to go on ahead, move fast. The road to Cóbreces. Before the town, take the turn-off to Novales. The spot is a mile further on. Be careful. Spread out and wait for us. We'll arrive 15 minutes later. Get going! If there's any trouble, use the phone. Right. Let's go. What's to stop us taking the money and killing him... ...once we get the stuff? He'll have thought of something,... ...a plan to get away with the money and cheat us. Maybe he's got some help. There may be a trap at the spot. That's what we have to guess. We may be overestimating him. What's that bastard doing? Is he crazy? Hey, where are you going? Move, for fuck's sake! Run, old man, run! Another 10 yards! What's he doing? Christ! You said there was no risk! -What's this? -May I come in? Of course. -You want a coffee? -Yes. Thank you. Who brought you? I got the bus to Lamasón, and then a taxi. A taxi? Tell me what's wrong. I need to take a holiday, 15 or 20 days. Can I stay here? Could you stand me? I guess so. -Could I stand you? -Yes. -Definitely. -Then there's no problem. Now will you tell me what's wrong? Not yet. I have to talk to the lawyer. To Valerio? Why? He has to try to buy Lola's house. -What are you saying? -I know very well... ...what I'm saying. Mateo, the kid, has got the house. He doesn't want it. After a while, it'll be up for sale. And your lawyer friend,... ...without saying who his client is, or inventing a name,... ...can go ahead and buy it. Fantastic. Everything will be as it was. And the money? I've got it. You do? Yes. I'll tell him. Aunt Lola is still there. Sooner or later, that bastard will throw her out. Hello. You're Mateo. -I'm glad to see you, really. -How do you know me? I know you. As no one is capable of making you leave my house,... ... I've come myself. You've always acted like a fool with me. We're alone now. You know that this house is mine, it's always been mine. And if I was ever about to lose it,... ...your father made sure it didn't happen. I didn't come to hear you talk about my father. -Nor do I want to see him here. -Don't touch those photos! Take them with you to the Home, or to hell, if you want,... ...but I don't want to see them here. This is not his home. Why not forget that stupid arrogance,... ...and just speak to me? My men will empty the house, put on new locks... ...and block up the windows. I know why you hate me so much. And you may even be right in some way. But nothing can change the past, young man. Your father loved me, and I loved him. He may have abandoned you or you may have lost him,... ...but how can that be fixed? Come on! Get to work! Empty the house. Take the furniture... ...out to the back. Bartolomé. Go and get the boat. And hold your head up. Don't take anything out. -Do as you want with it all. -I want it burned right here. You would burn me too. I just want everything to end like this. I don't care about the house. I'll get rid of it, but you won't live in it anymore. My father came here against his will. You really believe that? Yes, ma'am. You haven't understood anything. I never want to see you again. Take this. This will show you that money has got nothing to do with this. Come here! You! Come here! Pick that up! What are you doing here? Mr. Lanza asked to see me. My name is Carlos. Tell him it's Colo. Wait. Who are you? Why did you say I'd asked for you? If I hadn't, I couldn't have spoken to you. Do I know you? Not very well, but you know me. Take off your glasses. Of course. Get the boys out of there. What did you say? Just let them go, without any fuss. ''Good-bye, boys, thanks. I don't need you any more.'' Do it like that. You think I'm torturing them? A bit. And why? After all, nothing serious happened,... ...and you don't know that they caused the explosion. You know a lot. I can offer you some of what I know if you do what I said. -The Chief wants to see you, sir. -I'm coming now. What's on offer? I can tell you about a load of drugs... ...that got stranded near here. About fellow officers who were involved. About different ways... ...of stealing, trafficking and killing... Stop, stop. I'll give you the end of the rope. You pull on it and, if you do it well,... ...the curtain may go up. You're very clever. I've been around a lot. I'll release the boys and hold you. Does this explosion have anything to do with what you have to say? More than that, I'd say that it makes a lot of sense. -Don't move from here. -No, sir. Spring is ending and I'm still not back home. Colo says that it'll soon be fixed and then I can move back in. After the fright, your son disappeared,... ...and I think there'll be no further contact between us. I'm living near here, in an inn, with Mirza. I've begun procedures to adopt him legally. If anything happens to me, he's got Clementina, Valerio and Colo. Colo told me the house is mine until I go to join you. The man is deafer and crazier than ever,... ...but the truth is I need him. And he needs me. Bartolomé, the other boy, is expecting his parents any minute. He too wants to live in the house, which he calls... ... "his home",.... ...but there's very little I can do about that. The weather is still the same as ever... ...and life, as you used to say,... ...is a great complication which each person... ...resolves in his own way. Mine is to let it go by, hoping it behaves well,... ...and doesn't sweep away too quickly... ...the little strength I have left. Stand back, please, everyone! Miss, please! Stand back! Come on, move! Bartolomé! Bartolomé, my baby! My darling son! My little boy! My darling son! Your Mom's here now! Very good, perfect. We'll do one more take, just in case. Back to your place. I was dying to see you, you rascal! You gave us an awful time! As soon as these bores finish, we'll talk about things. Now, run up again like the last time. Now! Bartolomé, son! My darling son! We couldn't find you, so we contacted the television. There's a program that looks for missing people. Then, when everything got cleared up,... ...we had to be nice to them, you understand, love? In Madrid, we'll do something more final. More talking, lots of close-ups, lots of emotion and tears. People love that. We'll need the boy, of course. -But what do we get out of this? -Popularity, and money. Are you sure? We'll touch the hearts of the whole country. Heaven is everything which I cannot reach. The apple on the tree if it is not within arm's reach. The color of a passing cloud. That land behind the hill and the house beyond... That is where paradise is found.
