THE OTHER SIDE A film by Bravo! Bravo! Well done our dear, fabulous Vanessa Blue! And now, ladies and gentlemen, still to come tonight, please get to your feet to welcome the fabulous, enchanting, breathtaking Miss Nicole! Would you like to stay overnight at the house? Please... If you want to dispose of the ashes, please keep the lid of the urn and the inscription plate carefully. Good afternoon. He hasn't left a message? - Not a sign? - No. Do you know if he was infected? It's us girls who've been infected since the day we were born. Have you decided what to do with the ashes? I'll take them to his parents. - They knew about you? - Yeah. Do they know how he died? Throw it all away. His things, the ashes too. Burn it all. I can't, Luis... "Fire liberates those who depart and warms those who stay." You've taken our son away from us and now you bring his ashes. Domingos wanted to stay in Alentejo when he died... You're the one who'll stay in Alentejo if you don't get out! Get lost! Our son died a long time ago... I'd die in his place if I could. Go away and take that before I lay one on you! Our son died a long time ago... Your son loved you both very much. I'll kill you, you son of a bitch! Fucking faggot, are you going or not? - Wouldn't you like to learn music? - No. - Why? - I want the theatre! - Theatre? - Yes. - Actor? - Yes. - You never said, Vasco! - Ah, it's a secret... I want to give you everything you dream about, Vasco. My lovely... - See you tomorrow, son. - See you. - Good morning! - Hello... - The weekend? - Cool! - We went to a concert! - You went to a concert? - You could have invited me... - You like music? - Yeah! - I do a lot! Start with Mr. Lima, he can't make head or tail of the treadmill. OK. - How do you get rid of a woman... - Woman! - Who wants to force you to many? - Who wants to marry! - What have you been told? - What have you been told! - I was told you're a bastard! - You're a bastard! - Plagiarist! - Plagiarist! - Take that, you scoundrel! - Scoundrel! - This is for being a no good lover! - Lover! - Gentlemen! Bocage's shyness... - Gentlemen! Bocage! prevented him from claiming he wrote... a beautiful love sonnet. - A beautiful love... - But now the truth must come out... - The mm! The poem I read at Count Pombeiro's is his, not mine! His, not mine. I would like, on this occasion, to remember Camões! Camões! - Bocage! - Bocage! What you wrote owes nothing to "You were lovely, Ines, As you were resting..." Resting... There's a film coming soon I'd like to see. - What is it? - It must be very sad. - It's about the death of a son. - Don't cry, my lovely. - You prefer cheerful stories... - Yes... I'm glad. - You're happy. - "The flowers Wither: "Die, oh Love, For Inês is dead." - What did that clown want? - A friend of Ricardo's called to say he's in hospital. - What's the matter with him? - He tried to kill himself. - Where is he? - In Lisbon... Are you going to see him? They'll give me Friday off if I want to go... Are you? Go! - Mum, am I going? - No, you're not. I want to go by myself. I haven't seen your Uncle for ages. - I want to see Uncle! - And you will. - When? - I don't know, Vasco... Don't go on, okay? You'll stay with your Grandpa and Luisa will help. All right? I want to stay with Luisa! No, you won't stay with Luisa! You'll stay with your Grandpa! All right, my lovely. Take my drawing to Uncle. I will. - Thanks, Dad. - Have a nice trip. - Anything for Ricardo? - No. - Bye, Vasco. Help Grandpa! - Kiss Uncle for me. - OK. - Take the drawing! It's here. - Why such a big bag? - I need clothes. - For three days? - Yes! You're too vain! - Look the door. - I know. The doctor says he's all right now, he's not in danger anymore. All he needs is rest, company and to eat well. I think some therapy would do him good too. - Are you a friend of my brother? - Yes. For many years. We work together. I was notified by a friend of his... Do you know who it was? It was me. For now some people still call me Luis. Others call me Carla already, but soon enough everybody will just call me Carla. Your brother won't wake up again today, he's heavily sedated. And the doctor wants him to sleep as much as possible. Maria, have you already eaten? Yes, on the motorway. - Have you got a place to stay? - Can't I stay here? No. You don't need to, Ricardo will sleep all night long. If you want, you can stay at his place, I've got the keys... - I hope you like rojões ... - I don't. - Vasco!... - Sorry... I didn't know... I should have asked... Shall I make you some eggs? No, thanks, I'll have it. - What sort of food do you like? - Pizza and MacDonalds! Next time I'll make one of those. It's a promise! And you, senhor José, would you rather have a pizza or a cheeseburger? - That's food for dimwits! - I love rojões! - At least I got it right for you or the whole meal would have been a disaster! Mm! Yummy!... Thank you, Vasco. I like it here. - Have a drink, Luisa? - Of course! - But Vasco here must prefer a coke. - No. I drink wine. - Your Mum lets you? - She's not around. The bedroom's here... The linen's fresh and there's pajamas in one of the drawers, if you need them... The bathroom is at the end, by the kitchen... And the towels have been changed too. There's milk in the fridge and some other stuff. There's fresh bread. You'll find the rest in the pantry. - Would you like something to eat? - No, thanks. But you'll have a drink with me... Maria, I was sure you'd come to Lisbon. Have a seat. Thanks. - Do you smoke? - No... That's sensible. I'll stop too as soon as my operation's done. Your father and son are well? Yes... How do you know I have a son? Ricardo told me you were pregnant when he came to Lisbon... He always believed it'd be a boy. - Is it? - Yes... Do you want to ask me about your brother or shall I just tell you it all in a nutshell? I don't like asking about people's lives. Very well. When Ricardo arrived in Lisbon, he didn't know anybody. He got a job at a baker's and I was the first person he lived with. I was with him when he came out of the closet, as you'd say these days. We lived together for almost three years but eventually split up because we have different tastes: Ricardo likes men who like men; and I like men who like women. But we were still good friends. When I began working as a transvestite, I invited Ricardo to join me: it would be a lot more interesting than being covered in flour all day and putting up with all that gossiping. At first it didn't appeal to him at all but over time he came to like the show and one day asked me if he could have a go at it. And it was a revelation! He's very good. And very professional too! Four years ago Ricardo met a boy from Alentejo in the bar and he became the great love of his life. They lived here in this house and us girls were all madly jealous of their happiness. Last week, just before Ricardo arrived in the flat, the boy cut his wrists in the bath. It was awful. His ashes are here. Ricardo said he'd take them to his parents but apparently couldn't part with them. When they found him he was clutching them. We girls are all very tragic and a little morbid. I'll let you rest now. - Do you need anything? - No... Thanks. We'll see each other in hospital tomorrow then. Good night. Sorry, but I'm rather curious. The fiancee your brother left when he came to Lisbon, did she get married? - Shame... Hi... - Hi... - How are you feeling? Fine... I brought you some cakes. Still got a sweet tooth? I slept at your place... Your friend Luis took me there... It's a nice flat... And you? Where do you live? In a flat as well... - Can you see the river? - No... - Do you live with anybody? - My son. He's sent you a drawing... Vasco has Down's Syndrome. He was very sad because I didn't let him come with me. Would you like to meet him? Instead of going to the gym you should be here working the land with me... You'd help and keep me company. - You got the pig. - The pig what? - It keeps you company! - Nonsense! I got the pig, so I don't need other company! - No! - You're clever, you. You're not dumb, no sir... When I was told, I was devastated. I had dreamt so much about that son, a healthy, perfect son. I was prepared to be a single mother, it was what I most wanted, remember? But not to be the mother of a child that was different from the others. In the early days, because of the danger of not surviving an infection, I wished he would die. I remember nights when I stayed awake, wishing with all my heart that my son would die... But then the baby started looking normal to me, he'd breastfeed normally, was very active, didn't show any signs of disease and I convinced myself the doctors had got it all wrong, that Vasco was a normal child. But he wasn't. When I finally came to terms with the fact that Vasco was different, I went through a terrible struggle, I felt so angry. But gradually things changed thanks to Vasco himself. He was a lovely child, he is a lovely human being, a son, a companion, and I have been very happy with him. And his father? He ran off. A year after Vasco was born. Don't you want to talk about yourself? No. - Grandpa! Grandpa! - What?! - Mum's home! - What?! Mum's arrived! How do you know? Your house is at the other end of town, boy! - I know! Go to sleep and don't be such a nitwit! - Is that Mum's machine? - Yes! Come! You stay here, Vasco can sleep with me. Wouldn't it be better if I slept in the lounge? Or with you? No. Vasco is jealous. Why didn't you stay with Dad? When Mum died, I told him we'd move in with him and he said, "Each in their own house." I only heard Mum had died four months afterwards. I'm glad you came, Ricardo. Mum, Grandpa snores! I don't! My body does! I'm asleep, I don't know what's going on. I like you. I see you got on OK... The kid could stay over once in a while. Yeah! - Uncle came with me. - Uncle? Yes. He's staying with us. - I gave him your room. - What about me? - You sleep with me. - Cool! Bye! Thanks. Bye... I'll have lunch with you at the gym! All right! - How's your brother? - Pretty low... Why did he do what he did? The boy he was living with killed himself. Did he ask to come? No, Dad, I invited him. - Is he staying for good? - No... Aren't you eating any more? Aren't you eating any more? I don't feel like it. The cake. Would you like some fruit? Want to go out for coffee? No, thanks... I bought some cake for you. Biscuit cake, you used to like it a lot. Give your Mum the plates, son. Vasco and I go out in the morning and are only back in the evening. - We can come have lunch with you. - There's no need. - Have you got a mobile phone? - A mobile phone? - Yes. You don't mind me being in your bedroom? No! I like sleeping with Mum. I'm not going to work tomorrow. You're not going to work tomorrow? Why not? I want to stay with Uncle! Your Uncle doesn't need you looking after him, he needs you to leave him alone. Come, go to sleep now, tomorrow we're going to work. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. May I, my lovely? You may. Move over then... Mum, Uncle is crying. - Ricardo is crying? - Yes. Don't worry, son, sometimes it's good to cry. What's this, Vasco, you want to have a heart attack? - No... - Then stop the treadmill! You don't have to burst to see the chicks! - I want to see! - No, you can't. - That's not what I pay you for! - Beautiful... There's some beauty out there...? Probably just some bimbo... - She's great! - I'll slap you if you don't get back to work! - Did he change a lot? - I still don't know... Something must have changed for him to try and kill himself for love... - Does it hurt? - Yes. Time doesn't sort things out inside us. It can cover them in dust but it doesn't move them away. - Has Vasco made him welcome? - He's delighted! All he wants to do is look after his Uncle... - Does your father know already? - Yes. - And...? - He didn't say much... He asked why Ricardo tried to kill himself... - And what did you tell him? - The truth. - Has he asked about me yet? - No... Not yet. - What are you doing here? - Looking. - Did your mother send you? - No. Are you hungry? Would you like a cake? Here! - Don't you want to visit him? - I'm his father and that house over there is the house where he was born and lived till he went away. You're right, Dad, but Ricardo nearly died... So could I, but he never cared! A father doesn't visit a son who nearly died just because of a 16-year old fight? Time doesn't wash away shame. Your brother shamed us all and didn't even attend your mother's funeral. And you want me to visit him?! Ricardo only knew Mum had died 4 months later, Dad! Uncle woke up and I gave him a cake. - Honestly! A cake!!! He ate it? - Don't know... He didn't mind you standing there staring at him? - No. - Try to leave your Uncle alone! Where's Uncle's car? It's not here! Maybe he went for a drive. Come on, let's go home. Mum, Uncle's not here. - Are you sick? - No! Then why have you got your back turned to the chicks? - I don't want to see them. - You don't want to see them? - Something wrong? - No. - Was it your mother? - Mum? No! Have a shower and go for a walk. I don't want anyone sulking in here! - No-one taught you to knock? - Sorry, Uncle! - Do you want to see my boyfriend? - Yes... Come here. - Lovely! - Yes... He was lovely... - Your boyfriend died? - Yes. - You're lovely. - Thanks... - Do you know Luisa, Mum's friend? - I do... I like Luisa a lot. Don't tell Mum. - Okay... I won't... - Friends? Friends. - Hi... - Hi. - Is Ricardo in? - No... Come in! - Is Vasco in bed yet? - No... - He's gone out... - With Ricardo? - Where? - I don't know... - Did you want to see Ricardo? - Yes. Why don't you wait for him to come to you? If he wanted to see me, he'd have come already. He didn't sleep at home last night... All night? - D'you smoke? - Occasionally, yeah. - And you? - Me? Yeah. - Good evening. What are you having? - What do you want? - A coke. - A coke and a pint, please. - Do you often go out at night? - Yeah. Where do you go? Discos? With Mum and Luisa. I really enjoy it. - Do you dance? - All night! All night!? - Luisa and I, we went out once. - What? Luisa and I, we went out once. We started to date as kids. Our parents liked it, everybody got used to the idea of us getting married and so did we. When the wedding day came, I couldn't do it and ran away. Excuse me. We're home, Mum! - We had a drink. - You smell of tobacco. I was smoking! Luisa left this for you. Lovely! - Shall we go to bed? - Vasco? - Can you leave me with your Mum? - Bye! See you tomorrow. See you. Does it bother you that I'm taking Vasco out? I invited you to meet him, I'm very happy you're friends. - He's a wonderful person. - Yes... He's always longed for a father. I'll be careful. And Dad, has he said anything? He says you're the one who should go to him. And Luisa? Still hurt... I wish you'd met Domingos. So do I. Do you want to talk about him? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! - Did you want to see me?! - I'm seeing you! - Do you want me to go to you?! - You're not needed here! - What if I ask your forgiveness?! - Your mother died without hearing from you! - I didn't know she'd died, Dad! You ran away! You're a coward! - Do you work? - Yes! - What do you do? - I sing, I dance... - You're a dancer? - No, not a dancer. - A transvestite. - What's that? A man who dresses as a woman and sings and dances like a woman. - Ah! You sing! - No. The music plays with the singer's voice and Uncle pretends to sing. It's a playback. Oh, I know! - That's it. - I want to be an actor! - You want to be an actor? - Yes! - On TV? - No! I want to be in the theatre! - The theatre?! - The theatre's nice! Yeah... The theatre's nice... - What do you do at the gym? - Everything! You like it? Don't go away! No, Uncle isn't going... Not yet. - Did you like the film? - It's sad... I told you... A son's death is always very sad. At least I'm off the hook on that score! No, you're not... You think I'm still going to have children? - Yes. - And where's the father? He's here! A charming prince, fair-head, blue eyes, riding a white bicycle! - Are you ok? - Did Luisa ever get married? - Why not? It just didn't happen. I didn't get married either... I'm going to get married! You're a very beautiful man, Vasco. Any sensitive woman will like you. - Is Luisa going to marry me? - Why Luisa? I really love Luisa. - Hi. - Hi. Who's this? It's a friend of mine. Sorry. It's alright, darling. If you say so. The day you ran away, I came here to kill myself. I'm glad you didn't. I'm glad you didn't either... We only have one life, Ricardo. Give me mine back. Can't you sleep? In the theatre, I can get married. You can get married in the theatre? I can get married, be a father... Of course you can be a father... An actor can be other people, right? Hi! Come in! Don't you think you're overdoing it about the past? For someone who has nobody, the past is good company. When we were left alone we promised never to feel sorry for ourselves. I was 5 when I knocked on your door asking to play with you. If I could go back to that day, I'd keep on playing by myself. It wasn't Ricardo who made you stay alone, same as it wasn't Vasco's father who made me have his child. How can you know you'd be better off with Ricardo? You're talking like that because you have Vasco. It's about him I came to talk to you. - What happened? - Vasco told me he loves you. Yesterday, your brother and I were together by the weir. I hadn't made love in a long time. And you, Maria? When was the last time you made love? And you want us not to complain? We're not nuns, dammit! If Vasco weren't your son, I'm not sure I wouldn't take his love! I'm going to make some coffee. Where's the pig? - You're eating it. - Where's the pig? - In the sausage! - What? Yes! The steaks, the chops, the rojões, the tripe, the hook, the sausage, it all makes up the pig! It's good! - You like it? - Very much! - So we'll buy another pig. - Cool! - Do you mind if I eat like this? - No... Of course not! - Do you sing like that? - No. To sing I dress up more showy. Vasco, the plate. - Can Vasco go outwith me? - Where? - For a drink... - To dance? - Do you want to? - Yes! - Are you going like that? - Yes. In Lisbon, there's a group of boys and girls like you who're into the theatre. Really? - Would you like to meet them? - Yeah! - Would you like to work with them? - I'd love to! - And Mum? - I'll have a word with her. - Will Mum come? - She can come... - And Grandpa? - You've got to decide, Vasco. You can't take your whole family with you. - You? - I'll be there. Uncle! Vasco has fitted into life here... I always fought for him to have a normal life. I know... But let him try, Maria. Let him go. It's his dream. Vasco's dependence has been my life insurance as a mother for 17 years. I thought he'd live his whole life with me, that he'd never leave home. Until today I've never cared for anything or anybody else. Vasco is my life and I was the one who became dependent. I'm sorry. I'll find some excuse for Vasco... - Let's leave it like that. - No. I'm afraid of letting go of him, I'm afraid of being left alone, I'm afraid of the grief and the void my life could become without him, but if Vasco wants to go to Lisbon, I won't stop him. Why don't you come with us? If Vasco can do it, I'm not going after him. If he goes, it's because he wants to grow up and all I can do is support him and be happy. Do you trust me? Vasco always has a glass of warm milk before sleeping. - Can I help? - Yes. Go and get the other hoe. My lovely Mother... Uncle! Is that your boyfriend? Yes. It's my boyfriend. Where's the river? We can't see the river. But it's not far. Come on. Let's put your clothes away. Put your coat there... You can keep your clothes here, okay? Uncle! Uncle... - What is it, Vasco? - Can I sleep with you? All right... Come on then... - Do you want some more milk? - No, thanks. - OK, sleep well. - OK. Put the light out! Stop! Stop! - Hi, Paula, good morning! - Hi, good morning! Hey, guys, come here! This is Vasco, he's coming to work with us. Introduce yourselves and say hello. Welcome him! Thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our show. Tonight is a very happy occasion for all of us. After a few weeks away, let's welcome with a big round of applause the return of our dear Vanessa Blue! Thank you for your kindness. Tonight is really very special for me and I want to dedicate it to a very dear person who should already be asleep. Thank you, Vasco, for your joie de vivre. "Lovely"! And now, for all of you... Music! I love you... To: Photography Music Producer Screenplay and direction Subtitling: Raquel Pinho Media Recording
