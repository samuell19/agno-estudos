(smooth jazz music) (gun fires) (footsteps thudding) - John! (door knocking) John. (door knocking) John. - Roy who is it? - George, open up. - Jesus Christ, George. - Where's your brother? - He's at the movies, what the hell happened to you? - Game sold out, it's a set up. Go and warn him. - A set up? - Warn him, go, go, go. (suspenseful music) - (gasps) Ron! - FBI! - Why no! (gun firing) (screaming) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (crowd shouting) - They shot John Dillinger. (suspenseful music) - It's John Dillinger. - Two long years Dillinger. (gun fires) (melancholy music) (suspenseful jazz music) (alarm buzzes) - So good to see you again sir. - One reporter? - 'Fraid so sir. - Jack Barnett, Associated Press. You mind if I ask you a few questions Mr. Capone? - Not much of a reception Cecil. - [Cecil] Not like former times. - Country seems to have a short memory. - [Jack] Well in case you haven't heard sir there's a depression going on and a war breaking out overseas. - I'm Al Capone, I made the depression, I fought my own wars. I was the king of Chicago before you were in diapers. - It ain't the same out here anymore sir. - What ain't the same? - Things have changed. - Oh things have changed? What people don't like their broads, huh? They don't like their hooch? The don't like the ponies? I tell you something young man, if you had the balls to half the life I've lived you learn one thing about people. People don't change. They're always willing to pay good money to have that dirty laundry done for 'em. - Somebody els is taking out the cleaning now. - You think I'm forgot? - No sir, I don't. - No, no, you think I'm washed up. You think some pissant taxman with little green visors brought down the king of Chicago? - No Mr. Capone. - Yeah. I'm Al Capone, you hear, I'm Al Capone. - Mr. Capone-- - I pick my teeth with a little shits like you. - He's not worth it sir. Please sir, it's beneath your dignity sir. - Yeah you're right. I don't have to do this. Let somebody else do it. You do it. - Indeed sir. - It's true what they say, about the syphilis I mean? - Oh I don't think Mr. Capone would take very kindly to the repeating that fact sir. - No sir, I think you're right. (ominous music) - What do you think of Florida Cecil? - Florida's lovely sir. It's not Chicago. - Huh, that's for damn sure. I'm having nightmares thinking of that, that half pint thief Gazzo sitting on my throne. Chicago's my town. - You're not thinking of returning are you sir? - I've done enough thinking back there in that rat hole. Now it's time to do something about that imposter. - Is that advisable sir? Our funds are rather depleted I'm afraid. - Don't worry about it, I got a plan. And when Al Capone has a plan, Lou Gazzo better worry. (peaceful music) - Be right back. (ominous music) (sighs) (peaceful music) - [Sam] Mom, mom, look what daddy got! He bought you some chocolates. - My, my aren't you good boys. What's the occasion John? - Nothing special. - Got some mail? - [John] Yeah, what's for dinner? - Chicken. - Smells good. You do too. (ominous music) - Do you have to? - I gave this man my word. - You gave me your word too. - Look I have to return something that I've been safekeeping for someone for a long time. Don't worry, nobody will get hurt. - That's not what I'm worried about. - Abi. You know I have a past. Maybe it's time you heard the whole story? - No. We agreed. The past is the past. For both of us. (smooth jazz music) (patrons chattering) - [John] Hello Eli. - Look at you, the dead man lives. People still don't believe I ran with a legend. - Let's get this over with. You can count it. - No, anybody else but you I wouldn't even see this. - That was your share. - What'd you do with yours? Got the girl out of her pickle and bought a farm? At least that's what I heard from George. Can't believe the great John Dillinger's a farm-- - No. The name is John Dalton and if I hear anything else from you again I'll cut your tongue out. - You're right, moms the word. - I'll see you around Eli. - [Eli] Stay. - [Waitress] You alright? - How about some pie? - No thanks, nothing. That postman over there is wearing wingtips. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Well, wait to you see the racks I'm gonna buy. - The guys not a postman is he? - He's a fed. John I was just gonna tell you that. - Oh yeah. I knew it was a big mistake, coming here. Has he got any company? - The cook by the door. - You traded me in. - John, it wasn't like that. It was the chair or this. These two feds pulled the strings. They're um, they know about you. Just didn't know where to find you. - They sent just two guys after me? It don't quite add up. - They ain't really feds. They was but, but they're trying to get reinstated. Get some glory. John I wouldn't have given you up if it wasn't for the chair. And I'm still not. Feel under the table. You taught me good John, you taught me good. - I taught you how to betray me and them. - I didn't have a choice John. - A man's always got a choice Eli, and you ain't gonna like mine. (screaming) - Eli! - Now hold it. - Nobody move! - You ain't gonna get away with this Eli. - I'll kill her, I swear. - No, no. - Go ahead. - I mean it. - So do I. - Eli. (groaning) (guns firing) (glass smashes) - Get down. (gun fires) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) - It's not real, I just got a fake one! - Hey, hey, hey slow down will you. - What? - Slide over, I'm just gonna borrow it. Hang on honey. (suspenseful music) - I don't suppose that's the police? - The FBI. (gun firing) (squeaks) - You better hang on babe. (suspenseful music) (gun fires) - Get this heap up closer, come on. (suspenseful music) (screams) - Oh shit! (screaming) (metal crashing) (suspenseful jazz music) (groaning) We almost had him! - This is not over Dillinger! - This'll be fine for me. And thanks for letting me borrow the car. - You know I'm a big girl now, I don't have to be home by dark. - I do. Thanks again. (distant screaming) (ominous music) Abigail! Abigail, honey. Anyone home? Abi? Sam? Abigail! Sam! (ominous music) (train horn blaring) (train chugging) (ominous music) - I'm sorry sir. I'm afraid these gentleman will need to frisk you. - I'm not armed. - Oh it's for your own protection, I assure you sir. There's a frightening number of firearms on the premises already. - Nobody's gonna search me. - Gentlemen. (groaning) (speaking in foreign language) - Oh dear. - I was returning it to your boss. - I'm sure you were sir. - (speaks in foreign language) gentlemen. (speaking in foreign language) This way sir. Please don't be alarmed at his demeanor sir, he's been rather ill lately and he's not quite himself. - My family in there? - Not at the moment sir, but I expect them shortly. In the meantime I'm sure there's things you and Mr. Capone wish to speak of. (ominous music) He's waiting for you sir. (balls clacking) (groaning) - Yes, look come on. You don't look like a man who robbed 57 banks. - You don't look like the kingpin of Chicago. - But I was. And I will be again. Just like you I'm back from the dead. Except it wasn't you who died, was it Big John? I mean how could anyone not recognize the great, the legendary John Dillinger? Even the stupid feds couldn't make a mistake like that. Unless, unless the dead body was close, very close, like a brother. - It should have been me. I'd give anything to switch it all back. - Yeah I know John, I know. Sometimes you'd give anything to stay alive. And sometimes you just want to die. Know what I don't get, is are the feds so stupid they still don't know or they just get tired of chasing you? - I never went back to find out. - I bet they're just stupid. Oh, I know they're stupid. Let me show you something. (laughs) I got something here you should see. This is a picture of J. Edgar Hoover in a dress. This is why they can't identify dead bodies. - Yeah but you can hardly make out the face. - Of course not, you think if I had his face I would have done any time? (laughing) - (clears throat) Mr. Capone. - Hmm. - May I ask what it is you wat from me? - There was a time I wouldn't need your help. I wouldn't need anybody. I'd walk right in, I'd take what belongs to me in broad daylight. Nobody would have touched me. But I can't. Not right now. Not right yet. So I sent for the best. I want you to get something for me. - With all due respect sir, I don't run errands for anybody. - Yeah, but you do rob banks. - I used to, I'm a farmer now. - I'm not asking to steal, I'm just asking to bring back what belongs to me. And I'll pay you handsomely for it. - Well if it's so simple, why bother with me? (speaking in foreign language) - Now we're talking. Let's have a little drink. A little something special. I think maybe we could be friends. - [John] Oh yeah. - Yeah. I like to work with the best, and I like to drink the best. 20 year old scotch. That's right, 20 years. What were doing 20 years ago Dillinger? - Nothing I probably shouldn't have been doing. - (laughs) My whole life. - So I hear. No offense. - All right I'll make it quick. I got about 15 million dollars stashed in a private bank Chicago and I want you go get it for me. Take it out, bring it back, I'll give you 10%. - 15 million dollars? - About. - No bank I ever hit had that much money. - So you can see why I need someone talented and dependable. - Someone with a family. - We got no choice. It's fate, you and me working together. It had to happen. Fate. (ominous music) - Dad. - Sam. - Nothing like family John, nothing like family. - [John] You said you didn't care who I was. - I didn't know you were John Dillinger. - I tried to tell you. - Well you should have tried harder. - Do you want to leave? - I don't think that's possible right now. We can't go anywhere without his thugs. - No, no, I mean, you want to break up with me? - I knew you had a past. I guess I thought it'd just stay there, - I tried to tell you. - It's so overwhelming, here we are guests of Al Capone. - [John] I never saw the guy in my life, I swear to God honey. - You shouldn't swear. - I'm sorry. - What does he want John? - You know, just some business deal. Don't worry, I haven't said yes yet. - He won't take no for an answer. - That's why he kidnapped you and Sam, but I might be able to figure out a way to get us out of here. (ominous music) (speaking in foreign language) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) - What's the problem here? - Nothing, no problem. - (speaks in foreign language) What's the problem? (speaking in foreign language) - [Guard] No problem, Sir Al Capone. - This, this is my guest. This, this, this is Al Capone's guest. What are you stupid? You insult my guests. You insult Al Capone, you think you can do that? (speaking in foreign language) - I can buy your stinking island. (gun fires) Oh now look, I got to go change. Listen, here's your hat Mr. Dillinger. Excuse me, I don't think they're gonna bother you anymore. (ominous music) - I strongly recommend you do not walk the garden again sir, unescorted. (distant shouting) - Weiss, Weiss is going down. What are you telling me? He's the one that made them all look Swiss cheese ain't he? Ain't he? - Who's he talking about? - Hymie Weiss sir. - He's dead ain't he? - Not to Mr. Capone sir. There's a great deal my employer refuses to accept. - How'd you like to be the one, huh, resting on the floor huh? Well that's crap and it's gonna be that because Thompson's in his place. Yeah. You should just sit down and shut up. Wanna sit down? - So it's true he really is gone. - Oh if you could have seen him before sir. He hasn't always been this way you know. It's taken rather a toll on him I'm afraid. - What has? - He picked up a nail from a prostitute years ago sir. - What about penicillin? - Oh refuses to take a needle sir, deathly afraid. In fact I think it's the only thing he's afraid of sir. - Maybe there's some justice after all. - No just another form of vengeance. - I heard a shot. - It was just wanted Capone's mugs blowing off steam. - You're bleeding. - I'm all right. - I got so worried when you didn't come back. - I'm sorry Abigail. There's no way out. You and Sam are gonna have to stay here for a while. (suspenseful jazz music) - Thank you sir. (peaceful music) - Hello. - Yes sir. - You got a suite for Mr. John Dalton and my associate Mr. Baumgartner. - Yes sir, and are you in Chicago on business Mr. Dalton? - That's right I am. - Room 404 and your luggage will be right up. - Got a light? - I'm sorry I don't smoke. - [Cecil] May I sir? - Oh, here you go. - Are you visiting Chicago? - Yeah, business, sales. - Me too. Maybe we could get together, exchange samples. - Maybe so. (ominous music) (gun clicking) I wanna case that bank right away. Find out if there's any way to get in there at night so we don't draw any unnecessary attention. - I'll gladly show you now sir. - Thanks. Will you stop? - Sorry sir. This way sir. Just a moment sir. - What's going on Cecil? - Bear with me sir. - After you. - This way sir. Would you mind sir. (suspenseful music) (groaning) Mind your head sir. (people chattering distantly) Oh dear. - What is it? - Shh. (suspenseful music) What was all this talk about a bank? - I was speaking metaphorically sir, it's rather a fault of mine I'm afraid. - You got a lot of faults Cecil. It's a bank all right, the mobs bank. You got any more surprises for me? - Can we go now sir? (people chattering distantly) - Ready for a swim Bobo? Let's see. (metal taps) Oh, sounds like you're ready to me. - Am I right or wrong, that mug is Lou Gazzo? - Yes sir. - Mr. Gazzo I-- - What? What's the matter? Look, you're all hot and sweaty. Don't you think a nice swim in the lake will cool you down? - But I don't want to die like that. - Like what? Sinking into 400 feet of water. Wet, cold, dark. Clinging to your last breath 'til your insides are gonna explode, you don't want to die like that huh? Alright. Alright, then let's-- - Boss! - Let's see you die like a man. (suspenseful music) Go on. No, no, no. I said like a man. Don't you want to take the guy who did this with you? Now you shoot me and Italo makes up to shoot you, nice and fast. What are you waiting for? - I don't want to shoot you Lou. I could never hurt you. I love you Lou. - You do huh? (sobbing) - Look alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, come on, come on, hey, hey. Take it easy alright. Take it easy. (suspenseful music) Take it easy. You alright? Take it easy. Come on give it to me. What? You didn't think it was loaded did you? (laughing) - That was good one, that was good one. (laughing) - Of course not Lou, you're smarter than that. (laughing) (gun fires) (suspenseful music) - Go ahead fella's, don't worry Bobo, I appreciate what you've done and I ain't gonna throw you in Lake Michigan. 'Cause I don't want to scare the fish. Yeah I like fish, especially in Hollandaise sauce huh? (laughing) But I don't like you. (gun fires) (suspenseful music) - Alright. Clean him up. - I'll go first sir, make sure it's clear. - Okay. - Hey what are you doing? (coughs) Hey I know you. - Uh, I don't think so sir. - I never forget a face. What's your name? - Henry and this is my first trip to Chicago, so I'm quite sure that we've never met. - Oh yeah, well what are you doing here? - Staying here. - In the linen closet? I know what you're up to, you're stealing towels. Now get out of here. Don't let me catch you again. Hasty (laughs). (door knocking) - Oh. - That was very close, but I don't think he recognized you. - I'll take that sir. - You want a drink? - Oh yes please sir. - So why didn't you tell me you worked for Capone when he lived here at the hotel? - Sorry sir. I've been in Mr. Capone's service for some time now sir. I managed his estate in Florida while he was away in prison sir. - Why? - [Cecil] Sir? - I mean why would someone like you end up working for a guy like that? - Gambling sir. - [John] You lost a wager? - Oh no sir, I was the wager. - Somehow I think I understand how you must have felt. Here you go. - Thank you sir. - So what am I supposed to do down there? Rob Gazzo's vault. - (laughs) No sir. The money's not in Mr. Gazzo's vault. - No? - No sir. - Then where is it? - Mr. Capone didn't like banks or believe in vaults sir. Perhaps due to gentlemen like yourself sir. - Bank robbers. - Yes sir. No, prior to going to prison sir, he took the money downstairs to the basement and sealed it up in an alcove sir. - I see. And since then Gazzo has moved his operation down there. - It would appear so sir. - But he doesn't know anything about this money? - Oh, I shouldn't think so sir. The wall appears to be intact. - I see. This isn't what I bargained for. - What you intend to do sir? - I intend to contact your boss and tell him to find another dead man to pull off this job. - Speak to him by all means sir. - Yes operator. Hold it please. What? - Hotel operators tend to eavesdrop sir. - Never mind miss, thank you. - Thank you sir. Might I suggest a call box in the foyer sir? - You might. - Thank you sir. - "It gets curiouser and curiouser." - Lewis Carroll sir (ominous music) This way sir. - [Al] Is everything alright? - Well no sir, everything is not alright. You didn't say anything about the mob. - [Al] Ah, that's exactly why it'll work. They'll never expect anyone to try. - Look, uh, Mr. Capone, uh, these guys are like a small army you understand and no matter how much talent you think I have, I'm still only one man. - Relax, you got Cecil. - All right one man with a butler. But either way sir, this just ain't gonna work. - If you need help, you need help. Of course they get paid out of your share. Stop worrying John, nobody can hurt you. You're already dead. - Hello. Oh, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting ma'am, but there are some empty booths. - Oh I know I wanted yours. - Then by all means, be my guest. - It'd be my pleasure. - [John] Pleasure is entirely mine. (clears throat) - Shall I pack the bags sir? - I think not. We're gonna need some more men. (ominous music) - Mr. Capone. Mr. Capone. Mr. Capone. (groaning) It's Abigail, Mr. Capone. - Hey. What do you want? (clears throat) What do you want? - I've led a hard life. I've made some mistakes, but I don't want my son to suffer for them. Let him go, let me send him to my sister's house. You can keep me prisoner if you want, but please just let him. (glass rattles) - Hey no, no. Hey, I got people to do that. Sit down, please. You're a prisoner huh? You've been in a real jail little lady? Forget about it. Oh you think this is a prison, well it is. Not for you. Pardon me, but I'm the prisoner. I'm a prisoner in my own home. - Let my son go. Keep me but let him go, or I'll shoot. - I don't want your son, and I don't want you. I just want to smell the fear on their fingers when I shake their hands. - I'll shoot. I will. No. (sobbing) - Hey, shh, shh. No, no, no, no, Mrs. Dillinger please don't cry. Hey, don't cry. Go to bed, go to bed, go to bed. That's it. (sobbing) - Hey, hey. Some big Buick just pulled up. - So what? Some poor slob died and can't afford a hearse. (ominous music) - That's him. - I'll be damned, our boy just walked in the front door like he was gonna confess. - Yeah and losers don't confess to nothing. - Excuse me sir. When is the next penitence service? I'd like to get some things off my chest. - We don't take kindly to sinners around here. - Then I think we're both in the wrong place George. - John! (laughing) John! (peaceful music) How are ya? - I'm good kid, how about yourself? - Great. - What the hell are you doing here? - I'm the custodian. - George what happened to your eye? - Oh, rough night way back. - You finding any wooden nickels under the pews? - This joint is closed. The preacher here runs up with the choir director. I'm running the joint. (laughing) - Not a bad cover kid. - [George] It would have been great when we were knocking down those banks huh John? - Which reminds me, can you take a few days off from your service to the Lord? - I just clean for Him, I don't sing His songs. - Well I got an offer for you, but I don't feel comfortable talking about it around here. - Let's step outside. - What do you think? Let's go in. - No, let's sit tight, see what happens. Churches give me the creeps anyway. - Hmm, me too. I always hated Sunday school, I never could remember a thing. - It won't be easy of course, but that's the deal. So what do you say George, you want in? - Of course I want in. - What's the problem? - I don't think I can handle Thompson, you know I got a nephew, he's a spunky kid but he's dependable. I can pay him out of my cut of the loot. - Wait, what did he do? Did he pay you go along with this daydream? - I don't know what he's been telling you, but it's true we did run with Dillinger. For a while anyway. - Uncle George? - Uncle George. - He's blind as a bat. - He wasn't blind then. - No, he's a straight owl. Even my momma trusts him. He gets all wound up by pitch pennies, you gonna tell me that he used to run with John Dillinger? - Yeah. - The John Dillinger? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm Al Capone's nephew. - Well nephew or not, how would you like to learn how to handle some scat? - Scat? That's a Tommy gun. - Right. - Oh boy would I. - Good, let's go then. - I told you. Didn't I tell you? The old gang is a mighty hard bond to break, especially when you're flat broke. (laughs) Let's move. (gun fires) - What the hell's going on here? (gun firing) - Whoa momma, this baby kicks right. - As you have just learned, when fired this weapon pulls up and to the right. So in order to steady it, use your shoulder like so. Grab the front, look down the barrel, spread your feet like a prizefighter. That's better. Here's a full load. - Uh, just to clarify sir, is the object they hit the bottle or leave it standing? - Hey why don't you go shine it someplace else limey. Who cares for that stiff anyway? - Al Capone. He's one of Big Al's best men. - Is that right? How is Uncle Al anyway? - Feeling ill I'm afraid. He couldn't make the trip, so I doubt you'll have the opportunity to renew your acquaintanceship. - That's a pity, that's a damn pity. All right. Anyway, this here, this is for Uncle Al. (gun firing) - Maybe we should have taken 'em before they unpacked all the heat. - Hold off, it'd be one thing to catch Dillinger. It would be another to catch him in the act. Especially after all these years right? (gun firing) - What about Jake? - [George] Oh, he's in the army. - And Matt? - Jail. - And Phil? - He's dead. - I'm sorry to hear that. Where's Jeff? - [George] Oh he married a doll. Five kids. - [John] It's not possible, it's only been five years. - [George] Well he's a happy man. (gun firing) - [John] What about Caplain? - Would you use him again? - If I had to. - Good thing he's dead. - It figures. That means it's just the four of us then. - Golly, you got a one-eyed Jack here, you got a butler, a baby, and a ghost. - How do you reload this thing? - I'll tell you what son, when we get ready to pull the job, you make sure you aim that weapon at the three of us. That way we'll all feel safe. - You know what just because you can get Tommy gun does not mean that you knew John Dillinger alright? Anybody can get ahold of a Tommy gun. - He's right. - No more lessons for today son. (laughing) - What? - Ah, Hoover's gonna have a fit. - That's the point isn't it? - This is a whole new ballgame now. (ominous music) - Shh. Let her sleep, she needs it. Do you like ice cream? Me too. I like vanilla, plain vanilla. But you can have chocolate if you want. - Okay. - Yeah, come on. Come on. - [John] I figure we need at least 15 to 20 minutes on the inside, the problem is how to get inside. What's wrong Cecil? - [Cecil] It's time I was making a telephone call sir. - Phone in the back. - Beg your pardon sir, but I feel rather awkward speaking to Mr. Capone in a church. - I understand, there's a phone booth on the corner. - Thank you. - Be careful Cecil. - You sure that blokes on the level? - He's 100% Jake, don't worry. Go on, what do you say? - I think we should go in through the loading dock. - No, we go in the back way they'll have time to wake up and spread the word. - Not if we blast 'em first. - You ever killed anyone son? - No sir, I have not. - You don't want to, ever. It ain't too late if you want out. - No, I ain't afraid. I mean George knows, I don't know what he told you about me but I've seen my share of trouble. - Son, go back and finish your work on the junction box. - You guys, you don't need my my help here for nothing? - No thanks. - See I was thinking if we go in through the attic-- - Let John figure out how to pull this job. Hey what about Eli? - Eli is most definitely dead, I was there. (electrical buzzing) What's he doing? - He's messing with the wrong box. We don't have a prayer do we John? (ominous music) - Good evening sir, it's Cecil calling. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, would you give me a minute? Yeah I'm being entertained. - Being detained sir? For what? - No, entertained. I got the girls, it's Friday night. Here take this. Now listen, on the support. (laughing) Watch it, yeah. Now once get the job done. (laughing) I want you to take 'em all out. - I think you're pulling my leg sir. I've never fired a gun in my life. - You take Dillinger out first. (gun firing) (screaming) (glass smashes) - Surely you can't mean me sir? It's Cecil sir. Cecil, your gentleman's gentleman. You can't expect-- - Calm down Cecil, you work for me, you're gonna get dirty sometimes. But you can always take a shower after. Listen, if you don't do it, I'll get somebody else. For you and him. (gun firing) (glass smashing) Do I make myself clear? Answer me. - Yes, it's perfectly clear sir. - Hey. You're not gonna believe this. - What? - You're not gonna believe who that is. - Who? - Al Capone's butler. Dillinger and Capone are working together. - Dillinger and Capone. - Yeah. It's just getting better and better. - (laughs) I'm telling you, I'm gonna be Attorney General. - Wait a minute, you know they used to say. - What? - They used to say that if Ness had a run for it, he would have been elected you President. - You vote for me, I'll vote for you, yeah. (laughing) - Well I got that fixed. - So do I. We're going right in through the front door. I always like going right in through the front door, didn't you George? - I guess. What about the mob? - Don't worry, those mugs are gonna let us waltz right in. They're gonna beg us to come in. They might even thank us when we leave. (suspenseful jazz music) - Here we go again. Five will get you, 10 they're packing. - That's a chump bet. (door knocking) - That's them. - Should I get that sir? - Get it. - All here, a piece of doom but we finally got 'em. - Let's have a look. - Problem is we could only get three. - They'll have to do. Cecil, I'm gonna give you a torch. What about the explosives? - Jake. - All right now remember, we're not gonna blow up the building. We're just gonna knock out the power. - Be just like that job in Terre Haute. - That'd be swell. - All right lads, eyes up. Now you know that Cecil and I have to lay low. They mark our mugs or if we open our yaps. So it's gonna be up to you guys to do all the talking and get us in that door. If you can't pull this off we don't get the first base. But you can do it, as long as you keep shining these lights in their eyes while you're talking. George you're the foreman, Billy you're the engineer. I want you to study those blueprints so you can at least sound like you know what the hell you're talking about. Cecil, you're in charge of the car. - Fueled and ready sir. - All right, gentlemen we move tonight. I figure if everything goes well, we can get in and out without firing a shot. But God forbid if anything goes wrong, or for any reason we have to separate we all meet up at your Church, George. That's about it. Any questions? - Uh. - [John] Cecil? - Something for butterflies sir? - Don't worry kid, you'll be all right. We'll make a bank robber out of you yet. Gentlemen, let's get into costume.

Oh Christ, pull over Cec. - You think that's wise sir? - Pull over dammit, I need your help. Okay kid, you're gonna have to hold this. - Alright hold it right there. This might hurt. - No, I can't feel nothing. - That ain't necessarily good. Come on Cec. - Would you mind stepping out of the car please sir. - What are you talking about? - I deeply regret this sir, I must return to the service of my first master. - What the hells the matter with you? The kid needs our help. - These are Mr. Capone's instructions sir. - To hell with Mr. Capone. You're working for me 'til I say different you understand? Now you got two choices. You get your ass back here and help me stop the bleeding or you can pull the goddamn trigger. Sorry son, you'll be alright. Easy, easy. - [Cecil] Will these do sir? - Where'd they come from? - Mr. Capone always insisted upon fresh linen when he dined in the car sir. - La dee da. - May I sir? I'm not altogether unfamiliar with this sort of thing. - Be my guest. - [Cecil] Just pressure please sir. - Alright. - Sorry for betraying your trust back there, but I had no choice. - I understand about the choices Capone gives people. Hang on son, hang on. - I feel it. - How can I ever make it up to you sir? - You already have. - You guys really do know Capone don't you? - Yes unfortunately. (moaning) - You get any feeling back? - [Billy] I can feel it. - Okay. - You'll be dancing on this before long. - [Billy] Thank you. - You try and stay still okay. Alright come on let's go. - No sir, like you I fear I'm dead. - Oh right, Capone would never let you forget it would he? - I fear not sir. - You make the best of a second chance. Good luck Mr. Baumgartner. - Thank you sir. (peaceful music) (birds tweeting) - Yeah, yeah we got the bleeding stopped but the slugs in deep. All right we'll be there in 20 minutes, thanks doc. What's the count Billy? - I got 14 and a half million dollars. - All right, Capone is expecting 13 and a half and that's what I intend to give. That leaves us with a million. No thanks. - But George says I get like five grand. - Well he didn't think you'd believe it, but the fact is he was getting half and he was gonna split it with you. - Wait, I get 100, I get $250,000? - No you get his whole share. - I get a half a million bucks? - Yeah, and do yourself a favor kid. Retire. - I got, I gotta know. Did you and uncle George, did you really run with John Dillinger? - Yeah so what? - What was that man like, John Dillinger? - That man is dead Billy and you'll be dead too if you think this kind of life has any future. Now let's move the doc's waiting. Come on. Up. (groaning) There you are. You stay put, I'll get the door. Feel all right? - Yeah. - Okay, be right back. - Hey, hey, can I keep this? Like a souvenir? - Sure why not. - Hey, I did good right. I mean, I did good. - Yeah Billy, you did real good. - Look at me, I'm like a gangsta now. Top my world ma, just like the movies. (gun firing) (groaning) - Federal Agents. Reach. Reach. - Man said reach. - You packing? - No. - Come here. Come on. Turn around. He's clean. - At long last, we're gonna get our due. Hoover's gonna have to eat some big croney. - Well, well, well we finally meet the mug himself. John Dillinger. - My name is John Dalton. - (laughs) Yeah, you go ahead and play your little game Dillinger. We know the truth. - Yeah, you see, we knew the man killed in front of the Biograph Theater, not John Dillinger. - Yeah, we just couldn't prove it that's all. - And you still can't. - Are you trying to tell me that I can't prove who you are? - Maybe, maybe not. Say do you mind if I have a smoke? Kind of calm my nerves. - In a Church? - Could be my last one. - Sure. - Thanks. - Hey well Gil, look in here. - Hey, my, my. Looks like we caught up with you at just the right time, doesn't it? - What do we got here? - 14 and a half a million. - It's the missing Capone money. So we get all this and the real John Dillinger too. This is real interesting. You, uh, thinking about the same thing I am Gil? - Yes I am Frank. (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (groaning) - We're in Church. - Well as you can see, I'm a little tore up here. - Yeah, how's that? - You see on one hand I could not only be the man who brought in Dillinger, but I could be the man who brought in Dillinger with Capone's hidden stash. Saying I could be a hero. And the other. (laughs) I could be very rich. - I'll make that easy kid, you're gonna have to make a choice. - How you figure huh? 'Cause I got the money and I got the gun. - I got this. - What are you doing? - I toss it and the money's gone, or you catch it and I'm gone. Either way you're gonna have to make a choice. You can't have both. - Oh you. - Come on kid, not much time left. - No you wouldn't do that. - Hey you like baseball? - What? - Baseball. You like to play baseball? - I love baseball. - Yeah, me too. Catch. (explosion booms) (operatic singing in foreign language) - I've got a problem. I got a problem. Well I got a good man, and I got a lot of money. The man's meant me no harm, but it's my money and I gotta make a choice, I gotta. (suspenseful music) Yeah, yeah you're right. It's the money. The money makes it go. The money makes me king. You know that's why we get along. Yeah you can't trust anybody or anything but the money. Where the hell do you think you're going? Hey I'm talking to you huh. Turn around. (gun fires) That's for nothing. Get me the woman! Get me the woman. (suspenseful music) (groaning) - Your prayers are answered son. - Dad. - Shh. - We're getting out of here, where's your mother? - She's down the hall. - Is there a guard at this door? - No, he's around the corner. - You think you can get him to turn his back to me? Okay. - Alright. - Be careful. - Yes dad. (speaking in foreign language) - Getting ice cream. (speaking in foreign language) - [Abigail] You wanted to see me? - Yeah listen Kitty, clean up that mess. I made a mess. I'm sorry boo, I thought he was taking my money I had to. - It's okay, I'll clean it up. - It's okay? What do you mean it's okay? You two-timing slut. You've been pulling his bell-rope, huh Kitty? You're supposed to belong to me. - Mr. Capone, I'm not Kitty, I'm Abigail. - You liar. (gun fires) (screams) It's beautiful how a gun can clean up all your messes. Kitty you ain't dead? Here Kitty. Here Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty. Here. - Stay here, don't move. (guns firing) (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Weiss. In my own home! I'm in here Weiss. (guns firing) (glass smashes) Yeah. Let me get it. (gun firing) (glass smashes) - Cecil, is that you Cecil? Did you get Weiss? How'd he get away? - I'm afraid he's got away sir. - That's alright, that's good. He'll be back. It's like old times. I'm back on top Cecil, I am back on top. I can always tell when the blood flows and it ain't mine. I am back on top. To the king of Chicago. Maybe we'll go to Florida for the winter. Treat the boys to some Cuban nookie and some spiced rum huh? Do I have reading glasses Cecil? I can't see a damn thing. (ominous music) Oh Cecil, make the plans for Florida. - Very well sir, I shall make all the arrangements. - Sam. No, honey. - Sam what do you think you're doing? - He was gonna kill my mom. - Wait a second, think about it. Now look at that man. If you pull that trigger you'll be killing yourself son, not Al Capone. - But he was gonna kill my mom. - I could take that gun away from you, but this has to be your choice. (gun clicks) Sam. Atta boy. Atta boy. (operatic singing in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (peaceful music) (suspenseful jazz music) (melancholy music)
