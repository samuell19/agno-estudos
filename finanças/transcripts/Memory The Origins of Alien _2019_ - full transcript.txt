Every film is a product of its time. And every successful film tells you something about the time it was made. It's successful because it resonates with stories and images that people need to see at that particular point. "Alien" is a radical break with science fiction. This is not the notion of the alien that we were building toward in something like "Close Encounters." "Star Wars" comes out, we have a fun space adventure. And then "Alien" comes out, and people embrace it. And then just a couple of years later, "E.T." and John Carpenter's "The Thing" come out, and audiences resoundingly are like, no, thank you. We want our aliens to be nice and squishy and cool and eat candy. I think there's a special status that comes to some films that lodge in the audience's collective imagination, and I think "Alien" is certainly one of those films. Tolkien talked about the cauldron of stories, and certainly, "Alien" is an example of a story drawing from a real global set of myths. If you look at a somatics experiment, what you're going to see is sand that vibrates in a shape, and the shape changes based on the different vibrations. A myth is like something that vibrated from something deeper that you can't see. You see a major curse in the form of the alien, who is very much a fury, responding to an imbalance. We're looking at a story where there is a piece of material prop that is now completely alive in our imaginations. It lives in our dreams. It lives in our cultural conversation. It's one of the biggest cultural dreams we've ever had. I met Dan at USC. He was a real standout. You couldn't miss him. He was a wild man, unbounded by conventional reality. You couldn't call him an iconoclast, because he didn't have icons to break. He could be very offensive, and was frequently offensive on purpose. He was hot, you know, emotionally hot, emotionally responsive, very angry. He was born and raised in rural Missouri and had no television. They didn't even have a telephone till he was 10. They lived in the middle of nowhere on 24 acres. And yet he knew all these things. They didn't even have a library in the town. His mother used to send off for boxes of books, and they would come, and he would read them, and then they'd send them back. Dan was always sneaking science fiction. His mother always wanted him to read good literature. And his mother would always say, you haven't got any of that science fiction in your backpack, have you? You're not taking that science fiction to school. His father owned a curio shop, it was called Odd Acres. There was a sort of screwy Louie room, you know, where things were sort of off kilter, and everything looks like it's leaning. That was growing up in Odd Acres. One time his father faked a UFO landing. And Dan helped him, and then he had the press out there, you know? By direction of the President of the United States, stay in your homes. I repeat, stay in your homes. Because in one moment of history-making violence, nature, mad, rampant, roared its most awesome creation. There's a lot of bugs there. And he was always very frightened, in a way, by the sudden appearance of bugs, like a stick insect and cicadas, massive invasions in southern Missouri, they would have hundreds of thousands of them come out of the ground and swarm over everything and then vanish and die. So these things really gave him the creeps. And he wanted to creep everybody else out too. But he was quite an artist. And when he was thinking of his monsters, he would sketch them out. Before "Alien," Dan had written a screenplay called "They Bite." It was "Alien" before "Alien." And it involved a cicada-like creature, but instead of being 13 years underground, it was several million years underground, and gradually picks off the people in the encampment one by one. It's a version of an alien creature evolving, needing an evolution, and being destructive in that evolution. O'Bannon has this great line, says, "I didn't steal from anybody. I stole from everybody." And one of the places that he happily admitted that he stole from was a 1951 EC Comic called "Seeds of Jupiter." There's just eight pages. It starts on an aircraft carrier, and this orb crashes onto the aircraft carrier, breaks apart, small orb, and it's got like, 50 seeds. And there are three Navy guys on the ship, and they're wondering what it is. One of them's called Peach Pit, and he likes to put peach pits in his mouth, and the other two guys sort of trick him into putting one of these seeds into his mouth. And then they slap the guy on the back, it's all good fun and he swallows. He gets terribly sick. He's dehydrated. It's emergency surgery. He's going die. The Navy surgeon takes a scalpel, cuts open his chest, everybody shocked, and out pops this hideous, scaly, disgusting mini octopus. And then it literally scamper across the deck and plunges into the sea. And they go, well, we're never going to see that again. Guaranteeing that they'll be seeing that again. The origin of "Death Rattle" was in a farmhouse in Minnesota. The story itself is some sort of astronaut coming across an object. It's the kind of statuary that you might see in a temple in some ancient civilization. In the process of sending it back, he drops it, he breaks it, and he releases something that's about to change his life in a very horrible way. He is attacked by this thing that gets into his body. He is effectively raped. His eyes are gouged out and something goes into his head. And from that point on, he becomes a receptacle for something that's taking him over. Something is transforming a person into something very, very different, very unfortunate, shall we say. As a healthy young kid growing up in the Midwest in the 1950s and '60s, there were things going on in the world that didn't quite make sense. Television was very safe and cleaned up, so I clamored for things that I wasn't getting from my civilization, from my culture. Dan O'Bannon drew upon his experiences as a person from the Midwest, reading comic books at the drug store, like I did, and brought that kind of sensibility and that outlook on the world to this major science fiction horror epic. The Midwest may seem tranquil and civilized and so forth, but the fact is, you never know who's next door. You never know who's going to roll into town, you know, when the wheels are going to come off. It's like we're all, you know, one cough, one kiss, one scratch away from global disaster. The influence of Lovecraft on Dan was considerable. The eggs lying dormant on the planetoid is comparable to the cicada's million year life cycle, isn't it? Creatures coming out of the ground after being dormant for millions of years is superbly Lovecraftian, completely. I think that's a pretty straight line between the two. Lovecraft, in his own day, was a pioneer of science fiction. More specifically, his brand of horror fiction, which he called weird fiction. He felt that the essence of horror is the unknown, and what is most unknown, it is what is out there in the depths of space, and what has happened in the far distant past. Many of the features of "Alien" have a lot to do with Lovecraft's short novel, "At the Mountains of Madness." This is a novel he wrote in 1931. And it's something that he'd wanted to write for a long time, because he had been fascinated with the Antarctic since he was a boy. An expedition from Massachusetts goes down there, and come upon fossilized remains of alien entities, which this expedition labels The Old Ones. It's been dead a long time. Fossilized. In the course of this novel, they become unfrozen and come to life. They cannot be defined by normal human or terrestrial biology. I have confirmed that he's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides. Has funny habit of shedding his cells and replacing them with polarized silicon. In fact, the explorers find this immense city that The Old Ones built hundreds of millions of years ago in the Antarctic, full of very bizarre architecture. There are these alien creatures that are virtually indestructible. They simply cannot die. How do we kill it, Ash? There's gotta be a way of killing it. How? How do we do it? You can't. Classical science is based on the idea that matter is dead and inert. And this is true throughout Western consciousness, from Prometheus and Pandora to Adam and Eve. Space is empty and quiet. Is it? That's a perspective that we have. And I think "Alien" is very much the nightmare to that perspective. And you see this in the Coptic jars where they move. And you see this when you get out into the depths of space where it's supposed to be quiet and dead, and instead, you find the boogeyman. I cannot think of a film out there that comes anywhere close to "Alien" capturing that overall Lovecraftian atmosphere. That planetoid where the ship lands is a prototypical instance of what Lovecraft called the fear of the unknown. It is a place completely uncharted by human expeditions. No big budget studio wanted to put a lot of money into making a pure Lovecraft film, and so people like O'Bannon and John Carpenter and others had to sort of use Lovecraftian elements covertly to infuse Lovecraftian themes into works that were not explicitly based on any of the stories. "Alien" didn't come out of a creative vacuum. It drew on a whole heritage of American science fiction. You could make the argument that "Alien" certainly borrows from "It, The Terror from Beyond Space" from 1958. A crew of 10 goes to Mars to recover the lone survivor of a previous expedition. The rest of his crew has been wiped out. Today, of all my crew, I, Colonel Edward Carothers of the United States Space Command, am the only one alive. They obviously think he did it. He says, no, an alien did it. What are you thinking about? Those nine bodies you left down there? Yes. But I didn't kill them. Spoiler, it was an alien. The alien stows away on the ship and starts picking the crew off one by one. It's hiding in the air ducts. Bullets, grenades, nothing stops it. What do we do now? And it's killed by an air lock. "The Thing" from 1951 is very present with the idea of this creature that kind of hatches, that mimics, that is in a working environment. You can go to the 60s and look at "Planet of the Vampires," where they find this giant alien corpse. Doesn't look like any ship I've ever seen. Do you think it belongs to the Orients? I doubt it. I doubt if the Orients ever built any spaceships. If they... - ...we would have... - Look, Mark. One of the films that "Alien" draws quite heavily from is a 1966 film produced by Roger Corman called "Queen of Blood." Listen. We've been picking up these signals now for three days. An alien distress signal is received by Earth. Astronauts go out to find the source of the signal. They land on a planetoid. There's this strange sandstorm. They go into an alien vessel. They find a dead alien sitting in a chair, encounter an alien who they're bringing back to Earth, and the alien begins individually attacking members of the crew. And at the end of the film, the humans are left quite literally holding a tray of her eggs. Is this the beginning of the end for humanity? John Carpenter roped in Dan O'Bannon to helping him make the student science fiction film called "Dark Star." And it was about the crew of a spaceship... this might sound familiar... who then is assailed by an alien who sort of stows away on the ship. "Dark Star," that's the comic version of "Alien." One makes you laugh, and the other one's going to eat you alive. Carpenter wanted sole directing credit, and O'Bannon felt he'd done enough to get cowriting credit. So they had this kind of big falling out. And O'Bannon's first thought is that, well, I can go and do this on my own. I will write a story, a science fiction story that will beat "Dark Star." Wouldn't you consider another course of action? For example, just waiting around a while so we can disarm you? No. Because I'm not going to do a comedy, I'm going to do it as a horror movie. The ship will automatically destruct in T-minus five minutes. You bitch! A lot of things bother me about "Dark Star." We had an alien in it, which was a beach ball. It was our second try on that alien. I went away from "Dark Star" really wanting to do an alien that looked real. Jodorowsky saw "Dark Star," which is how he found out about Dan O'Bannon. Nobody in Hollywood was impressed with Jodorowsky. So he said, well, to hell with you. So he found Dan and said, come work on "Dune" with me. If you want to look to the first magic, I think you have to go back to Jodorowsky. Jodorowsky was his guru. He adored him. I've never met him and I adore him. Not only is there a synchronicity that connects "Dune" and "Alien," there's almost an archetypal counterbalance between the two. If "Dune" is the Tower of Babel, "Alien" is exactly what brings down that tower. In the same way that "Alien" is the response to Prometheus trying to steal fire from the heavens, the movie "Alien" is also a response, energetically, archetypally, to the Tower of Babel project that was "Dune." When "Dune" collapsed in Paris, Dan came back and actually crashed on the couch in the house I was living in with a bunch of people because he didn't have anywhere to go. And it... he... he was completely at a loss. Eventually, he... we said, you got to go. So somehow, he wound up on Ron Shusett's couch. I went back to storage, got my typewriter out, took it over to Ronnie Shusett's living room, and over the days and nights of the next three months, Ron keeping me alive by feeding me hot dogs. We were both starving. My wife was supporting us. We had two rooms, that's all we had. He made up a board game called Poverty, sort of the opposite of Monopoly. You've got to land on enough spaces to pay the rent. You're out on the street if you can't afford to stay. It's absolutely a scream. In 1971, Dan was working on a story he called "Memory." It's basically the first 30 pages of "Alien." - I - had this opening. I didn't know where it was gonna go. I wanted to do a scary movie on a spaceship with a small number of astronauts. They're receiving a signal in an alien language. They go down to investigate. Their ship breaks down. Dan called it "Memory," because some influence in the planet gradually made them lose their memory. But that's where this story ends. He says, OK, I'm going to give you the first act I've got to this original horror movie I wrote. I can't get past page 29. Maybe you can help me do that. So I read it. 29 pages was almost exactly like you saw in the final finished product of the "Alien" movie. It was fantastic. Dan said, there's a key to everything. The key is how does the alien get on board? His concept was always it would come out of your stomach. Dan had a very bad case of Crohn's disease, which basically appeared while he was filming "Dark Star." So he was, what, 24, 25? And it eventually killed him. But it was an intestinal disorder that sometimes felt like it was devouring him, I think. Linda and I would sometimes have to take him to the emergency center in the middle of the night when the pain was so great. And at the same time, he'd been having conversations with Ron Shusett about wasps that procreate by planting that eggs into other insects. It was kind of all these things sort of come together and were being sown into the script. Ron in a way was really fascinated with the idea of human beings being a host for... for an embryo, that human beings were the nutrition for an embryo. He didn't have it in the script at all that it would implant something in his stomach and it would grow there. So I went to sleep. And I'm aware... it wasn't dreaming. It was something else. It was when your mind is in the subconscious. I was wrestling with a property in my sleep. I woke him up, I went right into his studio and I said, I have it. I have it. He said, what? You have the answer? I said, I have the answer. The alien fucks. He said, what? What are you talking about? I said, jumps on his face, it's a little creature then, little baby squid-like, sticks a tube down his throat, starts feeding him air, but he's implanting his seed. And it's going to grow inside him and burst out of his chest in the middle of the movie. There are over a million species of parasitic wasps. That means that of all the animals in the animal kingdom, the number one form of animal is a parasitic wasp. There are wasps that like to make caterpillars their host. They can also release chemicals that control the behavior of their host. And everything it eats is going to feed these larvae that are growing inside of its body cavity. On the outside, they look completely normal. So John Hurt having breakfast, that's a caterpillar with wasps inside of it. And then once those wasps are ready, they just blast their way out of their host. And if that's lethal to the host, fine. It doesn't matter. Ridley Scott liked to show film footage of one species of wasp in particular to his crew, and this is something known as the wood wasp. These wasps have to basically find a way to stick their wasp bags inside of beetle larvae that can be deep inside of wood. So there are all these alien things that parasites are doing all around us, and scientists are trying to make sense of that in the way that the crew Nostromo was trying to make sense of it with the alien. That's amazing. What is it? Why, yes, it is. Um, I don't know yet. Getting inside something else and feeding on it from within is a really great way to survive and evolve. The alien is just fitting into this fundamental basic pattern that you find on life, probably the most successful way to be alive on Earth. Giger really came from Dan O'Bannon. Dan suggested him on a stroke of genius. Giger consolidates every monster from every mythology around the world into a single creature. He embodies the mythic other. Jodorowsky rescue went to an opening of some of Giger's artwork in Paris and brought the book back. Dan looked at it and was just knocked dead by the artwork. They were fantastic, sexual, mechanical, biological amalgamation that was completely new. It does express Giger's own admiration for Lovecraft as a pioneer in envisioning creatures far beyond human conception. I think Dan and Giger met at the Lovecraft level, that sort of creeping horror and unnamed horror that you are free yourself to define. Dan and Giger both had similar interests in the "Necronomicon." While Giger was doing paintings on that theme, Dan was also writing his version of the "Necronomicon," which I still have. Its unpublished. It's a... a printed work. Giger was a mystic. He had his own mythology, his own cosmology. He took like a bee from different flowers to feed his own imagination and make his own honey with it. He's the mythology of the future. Of course, there is an Egyptian touch to "Alien." Hans, his favorite culture was Egypt. When he was five years old, he went with his sister to the museum. In the cellar, there was this mummy, an Egyptian mummy, and Hans, he was quite afraid of it. He was so deeply impressed by the black bones and the black skin. From then on, he went almost every Sunday. He was absolutely fascinated by the pyramids. In early storyboards, you can actually see that the derelict was a pyramid. And then later, Ridley Scott envisions this kind of ritual area of ruins. This ship is an emblem, is a remnant of a formerly great culture, an ancient civilization that's been long lost to time. That tells us that we should think of the spaceship, the derelict, as a temple. I think the derelict is a crescent moon, and ultimately, a symbol of death. You see crescents all throughout the story. In the original screenplay, the pods were in a kind of pyramid structure called the temple. That was removed because of budget considerations in the production. Three stages of the alien, you know, where the hole was put into a pyramid, and on top of it all, is Nut, the Egyptian goddess of the night sky with stars in her belly. And I think that was really beautiful. You see being born from her the heavens. And in many ways, this becomes an image of the alien giving birth to this species that could devour the heavens. Nut represents the duad itself, the realm of the dead, the realm of night, the realm of the stars. This is where the Sun goes every night. This is where the soul goes between life and death. We are in the aliens domain in this whole story. The first I saw of the "Alien" script was an early version. Dan O'Bannon brought it to me. And as I recall, the original title was "Star Beast." I liked the script, and I wanted to make it, but I said to Dan, this really requires a bigger budget than what I'm able to spend. Why don't you shop it around and see if you can get a big budget. If you can't get the big budget, come back to me and I will buy the script and make the picture. And a guy called Mark Hager got this script into the pile at Walter Hill's office. And it must have been a day when Walter Hill was at a loose end. He happened upon "Star Beast." Now, he thought "Star beast" was one of the worst scripts he'd ever read. He just thought it was awful. But he stopped, page whatever, 30, whatever it was, and went, what the hell? When Brandywine showed interest and optioned "Alien," Dan was, of course, being a pest and insistent that they use Giger for the creature. This is the letter to Geiger from Dan dated July 1, 1977. "Dear Giger, this week I've moved into offices of Brandywine Productions where we are beginning to make the design decisions for our film. The producers, Gordon Carroll and David Giler, and the director, Walter Hill, are as excited as I am about the possibilities of your lending your unique talents to our picture. Look over the enclosed description of the designs we need, then let us know how much you would ask for the paintings involved. When we agree, we send you a check for $1,000 as an advance against future payments. Yeah, well, Brandywine didn't want to pay the $1,000, so Dan sent him a personal check for $1,000. The face hugger, that was my first thing I did for Dan O'Bannon. He gave me explanation and drawings, and he said that he's jumping on a big egg, this egg is about that, so. And I thought that must be quite a big monster, so I did an enormous facehugger. And then he was jumping, I thought he could jump when his tail is like, it's curved like a spring of the Jack in the box. And from those sketches, he went ahead and did the paintings. And that's why the paintings say Dan O'Bannon's Alien, because Dan paid for them. Fox hierarchy come in to see some of the designs, and they fired him. Gordon Carroll finally said, this guy is just sick. Get him off our lot. Send him back to Switzerland. We're having none of it. So Giger was gone. Fox is full speed ahead with Brandywine. They're in preproduction Walter Hill is going to direct the film, and all of a sudden, the studio gets a call from Walter Hill, basically, where he says, yeah, I'm not going to... I'm not going to make this movie. I never really believed in it. I don't think it's that great, and I got another picture I'm going to do here. So good luck. I'm out. And that other picture was "Southern Comfort." Not a bad movie. Not "Alien." I read the script, and I thought, well, this is very solid, very interesting. It's not really an actor's script. There was no one else attached, and they're asking me to get involved in what was then a budgeted film for $2 million. $2 million sounds like an Ed Wood movie. So I turned it down. Ridley and I had just finished off the do list. There was this thing between Ridley and I about sci-fi, and that I was the sci-fi fanatic. And all the films that I used to show him, he would completely disparage and say, no, that's a pile of shit. He had the script through the door called the "Alien," and I tried to say, well, let me read it, et cetera, and for some reason or other, this time, he said, no, no, no, no, I'll read it first. And so he was in the next door office where we made commercials, and I remember him sitting there going, fuck me. I got a call a few weeks later, and they said, well, the budget's up to $10 million, and a director named Ridley Scott is going to direct it. I said, sold. I got a phone call from Ridley saying, get your backside down to Shepperton now. So I drove straight down there. When Brandywine brought Ridley on was when Dan really got an ally in a lot of what he wanted for "Alien" to be. Very, very rare occurrence when the writer can have that amount of influence. We thought he was gonna be the wrong director for it, and he turned out to be the greatest visual stylist since Kubrick's prime. And he's such a visual guy that the first thing he did was kind of to break it down into storyboards, draws his own storyboard, extraordinary artist, these fantastic images. But what it doesn't really have is a clear idea of the alien. It's not quite there. O'Bannon says look, I've got this book. When Dan showed Ridley the "Necronomicon," Ridley instantly said, yes, this is it. I was shown the book, Necro... Nomicom. "Necronomicon," OK, in Los Angeles, in fact, by O'Bannon. He brought it in. And I nearly fell off the desk. Said, that's it. And why look further? And so that's how I saw it. It was as simple as that. I've never been so certain about anything in my life. There were many arguments at that stage. Fox were really quite troubled. But it was an early sign of how strong Scott was on that film that he won so many battles. And the most fundamental and important one was he got Giger back on. And I just thought it was stunning, and I just stuck to my guns saying, no. No, that's it. They said, let's bring him in and talk some concepts. I said, no. You can't do that. That's it. We want to be shooting by so and so. That's it. Just to get this right is gonna be incredibly difficult. This is beautiful, not just threatening. And also has very sexual connotations. So in everything, it's like a rather beautiful humanoid biomechanoid insect. Giger talks about intentionally drawing imagery from his own dreams, that means coming from a place where he didn't have agency over what came to him. When he painted, he was in this sort of trance. He was possessed, like a seer, a blind seer. Would go like that, and like in a Polaroid, an image would appear and take shape. Giger's images existed in a universe of their own in Switzerland. And they really found their place in space, the xenomorph and the space jockey. Giger's images really found a home in "Alien." Part of what you're seeing with the character of "Alien" is this gorgeous synchrony, this incredible synthesis of multiple mythological characters, Sekhmet, Pazuzu, Kali. You can see the medieval dragon, the Renaissance demons, the work of Heironymous Bosch. And it's a synthesis that wasn't done consciously. It was a synthesis that happened in the cauldron of stories that was Giger's imagination. This is a character with which all three of these artists identified. And because they all resonated with this pattern, they were drawn together, this coming from a much deeper place. Such a brilliant choice that in the end, you could say separates "Alien" from anything else was you've got this extraordinary artist with this sort of mind-blowing imagery, and you inject it straight into the film. In the hands of perhaps an aficionados who loved horror movies and science fiction, it might have turned out to be a completely different movie. The triptych of Dan O'Bannon, Ridley Scott, and Hans Rudi Giger was the gift from the gods. They were on the same wavelength. And they were all thinking about this is more than a science fiction adventure into the future. This was just as much an exploration of the ancient past, of the repressed and forgotten that the alien represents. When a story comes from multiple people, and beyond the agency of multiple people, it has a special existence. It is a symbiosis. "Alien" is a symbiosis of a few people who had that sensibility. If Dan had gone off and been in charge, it would have been a different film. It would have had more of the "Dark Star." Ron Cobb would have been pure sci-fi, all perfectly done, more Star Trekky in a way, or "2001." I came on board and made everything look grungy and real and like a space truck, you know? "Alien", I would say we got the sets right. The audience didn't ever question that we just found some old space craft and gone in and filmed in it. That was different to the world that had gone before. There was "Robby the Robot," there was "Barbarella." It's both very tangible, and a completely different world at the same time. There's something almost perennial about the way that yes, those ships are a completely different environment from what we're used to now and what we would have seen 1,000 years ago, but human beings haven't changed, and they still behave in the same way. I place the hub of the wheel at Ridley, because he's a visionary, and he knew what to do with this film and how to marshal all these different elements into "Alien." He was running the camera, during a lot of the lighting, everything was going on at once, and he was just conducting it so splendidly. Ridley shot, yeah, a good 80% of the film, and it was a panel vision camera. I mean, these aren't light. He wanted... he wanted anamorphic on purpose. We were contained in a space, and that wide-angle lens made it seem much more claustrophobic. The costume designer who worked with Ridley said to me once, you know, Ridley's got a camera for a head. He knows where to put the camera automatically. When your hand-held, your breathing with the actors, you're just part of what you're filming. You're not distanced. I think that's one of the best operated films ever seen. It's not wobbly cam. It was very beautifully photographed. There's a great opening sequences where the camera drifts through the empty Nostromo, and he had this wonderful sense of movement in the frame. Even though they're all in their cryo chambers, there's a strange sense of life about the vessel. It's all kind of presaging what's coming. But it's a haunted quality that flutter in the frame. And he talks a lot about the fact that he never let the camera sit still, that it has to keep moving, because you want the audience on edge the whole time. You never let the film settle down. And even around the scenes where they're kind of just having these kind of rather sort of squabbling sequences between the crew, just normal ship stuff, this there's slight air of agitation about how he frames and how he moves the camera. He's getting the heartbeat of the film, this kind of growing throb that it has. The reason he wanted the ship in one path was he wanted to film like the Mary Celeste at the opening. He was tracking around the ship, and there were eerie little things going on, the pecking birds that I put in there for Ridley, and everyone said, you can't do that. I thought it's a great idea. The annoying thing, yeah, that was a Ridley realism, the little nodding... the little nodding things. He had a thing about that for whatever reason back from childhood. I loved it. They were in all the cars in England. Everyone had these blooming things that were nodding. And they always was a joke. You know, America had dice hanging and stuff, but England had these nodding birds. It's perpetual motion. How do you illustrate that this thing is just carrying on, and there's no human beings on it? It just worked to me. And that quite kind of going around the ship and the eeriness of it, to me, said a lot. The little papers rustling. It's all illogical. What would make these pages flit around? Where's the wind coming from? All that stuff. Yeah. It didn't make sense, but it did. Yeah. You know, it was like Ridley's vision. His eye prevails over... perhaps he'll forgive me saying... the scientific logic of something, which is hence why we had rain pissing down when Brett gets killed in that sort of chain hanging room. And I had several discussions. Having worked on "2001," where everything was meticulous and real, but rain in space? You know, where... where's it coming from? He said, I don't care. It looks great. It does. That was it. A thing that we got from Ben Burtt, we got this sort of that kept going throughout the film. It was almost like a breathing, a sort of an alien breath, breathing in, exhaling and inhaling. And I think it gave a kind of, just a kind of feeling that something was breathing down your neck all the time. Kind of gave you an organic feel to the ship. And then the computer chatter that comes on in the helmet, it makes you think, what's going on here? Everything that Ridley built up was building on this fear of the unknown, of something happening. Everybody's now waiting for something to happen, but it doesn't. When I started working on the film, I just realized that this... this film was going to be virtually in slow motion. Everything was slow, except for these stabs that you've got at various points. And you thought, how can I sort of push someone into a corner from the editing point of view, and how far do you go before the audience says enough's enough? There was a lot of, I think, studio concern about the fact that it was 45 minutes before anything, in their opinion, happened. Before the facehugger jumps out of the egg and... and hits John Hurt on the... on the old visage. But that was its strength. Indeed. That really was its strength, to be able to hold it back that long before you really gave it to the audience. They all found it very hard to cope with that. Dan O'Bannon had conceptualized very early on in his script that they wouldn't find the eggs in the derelict spacecraft. They would find the space jockey. Extraordinary vision, and it came from Giger. It was a Giger picture. And it did something brilliant in the sense that it showed you that the universe was extraordinary. It was haunting. It was almost certainly benign. You felt almost sort of a loss when you saw it. It was a kind of creature ossified to a chair. You never quite understood what was creature what was chair, and it was just brilliant. It's another thing that Scott had to fight for. Because Fox just went, well, it doesn't have any plot function, you know? They just go through the floor and find the eggs. Ridley said, you can't just have a hole in the ground. You've got to suggest something. In the chest of what was then the space jockey, which we now know to be the engineer, there's a hole. Bones are bent outward, like he exploded from inside. So you get an instance of what is a hint, a tiny little drop of maybe what these... these things do. And they lower Kane in on like, a wench. Can you see anything? I don't... a cave. A cave of some sort, but I... I don't know, but it's like the goddamn tropics in here. And he sees in there this great sort of tableau that Giger had actually painted. When we got that onto that set and saw what they had done, I mean, it was just... it was mind-boggling. Everything was actual size. There was no CGI. So you were inside of these big huge caverns that look like big vaginas, you know? I mean, everything had a sort of a very sexual orientation. So you've landed on the planet, and you've had this ethereal sequence. Kane is almost guided via the signal, some voice is calling him onwards. And it's kind of wonderful to think that there's something there, you know, that the alien spacecraft is calling him. We get finally to the belly of the derelict, and we get the egg chamber. That's the wake-up moment. That whole tactic of the beginning, the openness, and the kind of hauntingness, suddenly, it gets sucked inward. Up until that point, the film has been a kind of strange hybrid between a Kubrickian serious science fiction and this almost kind of fairy tale-like atmosphere. It's kind of strange sort of hauntingness. It's not, strictly speaking, entirely realistic up until the point they have dinner. The chestburster changes the complexion of the film from a kind of epic to a kind of horribly, horribly intimate and sort of claustrophobic and inward. It's kind of an inward movement, even though the creature comes out of him. Suddenly, everybody's trapped. Suddenly, the spaceship is small and confined, where before, it being this kind of fast vessel. And what the film does is make that hyper leap jump into a primal survival story about many more things than we realize. Ridley always says that this... this was the scene that stood out that would make or break the film. It was just some craziness that came out of Ron Shusett and Dan O'Bannon's mind. When you read it in the script, there's so many different ways to approach it. And Ridley was so constrained with the scene. It's a very significant moment in film history. The idea came from a painting from Francis Bacon. Ridley Scott told me that this painting, it's just a crucification, and one of the member has just teeth and red flesh, and he liked to have the chestburster like that. I've always been very moved by the movements of the mouth and the shape of the mouth and the teeth. And I like the, you may say, the glitter and color that comes from the mouth. When I was first went to Paris, I found in an old bookshop a book on diseases of mouth. The plates were hand-colored, and that it had a tremendous effect on me. The three studies for figures at the base of the crucifixion is the real point of departure for Bacon. He thought of that picture as his first picture. He was 35, and that's late, of course, for an artist to have a first work. This is his breakthrough work. And it's full of contradictions, full of paradoxes. How did suddenly this enormously challenging, unbelievably horrific and ugly imagery arise? The imagery is Christian. And Bacon, even by then, was a very violent atheist. You get the crucifixion in the title, but it is a mixture of Greek myths and Christianity. The Greek influence was very deep, and I think he thought of himself as somebody hounded by furies. And I think he felt their talons in his flesh. He said, oh, yes, the furies visit me very often. The temple of Apollo at Delphi was one of the major sanctuaries of the Greek world. It is really important in the story of the furies. The furies in Greek mythology are avengers of crimes, usually committed by children against their parents. And they first appear in Aeschylus' trilogy when Orestes murders his mother, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus. When Orestes finds refuge at the temple of Apollo at Delphi, the ghost of Clytemnestra tries to wake them up and rouse them so that they can fulfill their purpose, which is to hound down Orestes and take revenge for Clytemnestra's murder. The violence of the brings up the... the... the images. I mean, if you remember that wonderful translation of one of his lines, "the reek of human blood smiles out at me." Well, what could be more amazing than that? That immediately brings up the most astonishing images. The furies are a common torment to a creator, and here's why. To create is inherently a rebellion against creation. The fact that his father kicked him out of the house when he discovered he was homosexual was a lasting wound in Bacon. I think the furies, to some extent, are actually his father, his father pursuing him, chasing him out of the family home and branding him as an outsider. This image came fully formed out of Bacon's imagination. It's like Athena springing fully formed from the head of Zeus. I see it as the monster coming out of Bacon, and the monster coming out of the world. Myths are thought to be messages from the divine. When Ridley Scott puts this image of Bacon into Giger's hands, that's an odd synchronicity. And when you see the importance of the story, and you're looking back on it with the power and magnitude with which that story landed, all the synchronicities that brought it to that point seem all the more important and stunning. It's crazy that these scenes that are... a word I hate using, but they are so iconic. It seems like that page should be... you know, obviously, there should be like the Constitution, right? I mean, at some point at the end of "Citizen Kane," it says, and the camera turns and focuses and the... it's a sled, Rosebud. Fade to black. It's not like, you know, you know, you think and you go, ta-da! Right? But the chest buster scene is just a one-page description. Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he's trembling violently from head to foot. There's an incoherent shriek from Broussard, oh my god! A red smear of blood blossoms on the chest of Broussard's tunic. Their eyes are all riveted to Broussard's chest as the fabric of his tunic is ripped open, and a horrible, nasty little head the size of a man's fist pushes out. Everybody screams and leaps back from the table. The cat spits and bolts. The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's chest, trailing a thick worm-like tail, splattering fluids and blood. Lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table and screws away while the men are stampeding for safe ground. When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped. Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest spouting blood. The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with blood and slime. I'd make that movie. Yeah. The chestburster made everything possible for us. It wouldn't have been the magic it was without the chestburster scene. Everything rested on that scene from beginning to end, from getting the film made, to how the audience responds, to whether those monsters continue to live in our imagination today. It's that moment we finally assert that science fiction isn't only about minds, It's about our bodies. It's continuous with the directions horror was taking over the preceding decade, right? Horror is moving toward body horror, through David Cronenberg in particular. It's part of the texture of a film that to me, is one of the most tactile movies ever made. The sense of goo and grime, of things spurting at us, the sense of heat and steam and sweat. There is a tendency to think about the chestburster sequence as a scene or even a moment. But it really takes a while to build up to it. The Nostromo moving in. It's funny, isn't it, how all these, you know, outer space shots now have a certain sort of like, you know, generalization about them. You know, when you think about "2001," how gob-smacking that was at the time, and now we just take it completely for granted. Why is it called the Nostromo? The shuttle craft is called the Narcissus. Narcissus and Nostromo are both words that are used in book titles by Joseph Conrad, who wrote about the evils of imperialism. By allusion to the works of Conrad, there's a strand within "Alien" which is about a concern as to what humanity might find as it ventures into the dark places. In the case of Conrad, he's thinking about the heart of darkness, the dark places of empire. At the same moment that Ridley Scott is making "Alien," you have Francis Ford Coppola adapting "Heart of Darkness" to be "Apocalypse Now," and explicitly commenting on parallels between the Vietnam War and the encounter with evil in the British and Belgian empire. "Alien" directs our attention or reminds us of the dangers of imperialism and conquest of other places, what we might find in these uncharted regions, especially if we attempt to exploit those regions. I hate to bring this up, but this is a commercial ship, not a rescue ship. Right. It's not in my contract to do this kind of duty. The 1970s was a time of economic downturn, of threat, threat coming from new places. Ash, can you see this? Yes, I can. I've never seen anything like it. Particularly the first stirrings of terrorism. There were enemies within. There was political corruption. People had doubts, were feeling isolated, were feeling disillusioned. I say that we abandon this ship. We get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here. We take our chances and just hope that somebody... Lambert. ...picks us up. This is a consequence of Watergate. This is a consequence of the Vietnam War. This is a consequence of the political corruption in Europe. And I think that that uncertainty plays out in all kinds of movies from that period. If you look at '78, you get Ted Bundy's captured, John Wayne Gacy's captured, the Hillside Strangler's out there. So there's this kind of new phenomenon out there, right, the serial killer, and what does that mean? There's this kind of idea that there's something out there that can be completely evil and illogical and horrible. And there's no reasoning with it, and there's nothing you can do to really stop it. At no point in the "Alien" movies, and definitely not in the first one, do you feel like what makes us human is the thing that allows us to beat this creature. I admire its purity, a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality. There is a commentary in there about the way that things are going right now, and about what we're doing as human beings, and how we're taking those strengths, and those emotions, those things that make us human, and we're turning our backs on them. You have in these, in the 1970s, tremendous fear over what's happening to the American family. And I don't love you anymore. Where you going? I don't know. Panic about divorce, panic about family breakdowns. Here's what I don't understand, all the time... where are you... where are you running? All the times I come over here, I can't understand how you can prefer her to me. You can't understand that? No. It's a mystery. Well, you knew my history when you married me. Yeah. I think you can see that the crew of the space ship operate like a kind of family, and there are sort of family-type tensions between them. Before we dock, I think we oughta discuss the bonus situation. - Right, right. - We think we ought... One of the things that that strikes me about this movie in general is the way that it's connecting what's gonna happen with 80s movies and what has happened in 70s movies. Because sonically, it feels like a Robert Altman movie. You have this scene of all of these characters sitting around talking before they find out that Kane is OK. How about a little something to lower your spirits? Thrill me, will you, please? The way that it's blocked and staged, five or six people in the frame who are all doing something. Just give me the short version. People talking on top of each other at once at equal volumes, where you have to sort of decide who you want to listen to, and they're all mumbling and talking extremely naturalistically. It's doing the thing that cinema in America was doing in the 70s, which was to try to point the lens at a more naturalistic working class reality of America. The future of blue collar workers is something that's wholly revolutionary. And the movie, in a way, is about that. It's about the exploitation of these blue collar workers by the corporation. Hey, Ripley, I wanna ask you a question. If they find what they're looking for out there, does that mean we get full shares? Don't worry, Parker. Yeah, you'll get whatever's coming to you. Look, I'm not gonna do any more work till we get this straightened out. | "Alien," to me, makes more sense if it were made in 1974, '75, '76 than after "Star Wars." "Alien" is a smaller movie. "Alien"... I can't believe I'm saying this... is a realistic movie. Part of it was just getting away from that sanitized view of space that had dominated science fiction from the 60s and much of the 70s, and coming to something that felt like a real lived-in environment. It was continuous with the world we knew outside the movie theater. Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto are the two most working class guys on the ship. And they, unwittingly maybe, but maybe intuitively, know that if they just freeze Kane, everything's going to be OK. How come they don't freeze him? How come you guys don't freeze him? What I think we should do is just freeze him. I mean, he's got a disease. Why don't we stop it where it is? He can always get to a doctor when we get back home. Right. They're speaking the truth in this kind of almost Greek chorus kind of prophet way, but nobody really wants to listen to them, and they're just making fun of them. Whenever he says anything, you say right, Brett, you know that? Right. What they're making fun of them for is that Harry Dean Stanton keeps saying right, right, right, but it's because they are right. And in the staging of this scene, Dallas, the ship captain, is sitting closest to us, and there's this wall of the two working class guys between him and the two women, who are scientists and flight officers. And when he gets frustrated with this sense that, even jokingly, his authority is being undermined by these two guys, who are his employees, he crosses to the far depth of the shot to talk to Lambert, who immediately starts talking this sort of elevated, educated way. Well, according to my calculations, based on time spent getting to and from the planet... Just give me the short version. How far to Earth? 10 months. And you can really see visually in this incredibly subtle way that there really is this war about the movement between the classes on the ship and who has the right to be heard. Right. We now know that Hollywood in the 1970s was a very oppressive place for women. Do you find, in fact, that this, what could be best described as your equipment, in fact, hinders you perhaps? You think about the sexism, the misogyny that was implicit within the industry that made this film. You mean my fingers? No, I meant your... Come on, spit it out. I meant your... your figure. My figure? And there's no way of looking at "Alien" without seeing it as a male fantasy of the kind of oppression that have been being handed out to women over the centuries, a guilt that was part of masculinity in the 1970s, and should be part of masculinity now. "Alien" has within it fantasies of male pregnancy, fantasies of male rape, fantasies of male penetration. And it's all tied up with that amazing chest buster scene. I don't know how explicitly they realized what they were doing. I can't imagine that any studio would be like, yes, you're making a male rape movie in space. For sure, let's go for it. It's wonderful that the unconscious works in so many mysterious ways. It feels like a summoning in a major way, an accidental awakening of some repressed spirit. The furies certainly speak for the repressed feminine. And "Alien" certainly represents the repressed feminine's retribution. "Alien" touched a nerve with a lot of people because it was talking about something, that even in 2019, we're still not comfortable addressing. The idea that "Alien" is addressing the guilt that a patriarchal society feels makes perfect sense to me. We'll move in pairs. We'll go step by step and cut off every bulkhead and every vent until we have it cornered, and then we'll blow it the fuck out into space. Is that acceptable to you? Ripley was created in 1979, and it's insane that we don't have that many great female characters since. And especially in a genre like horror, that's given so many female characters throughout time, and yet, there's not one that strikes us as being as developed and as complex and as interesting as Ripley was. And isn't it ironic that she ends up being that way because she was written to be a man? Ripley is the only maternal character within her Promethean crew. Her transformation gives us direction for the transformation that we need to take as a culture to avoid self-destruction. She's a new example. When we start off this sequence with Kane, this very strange shot that's low angle, and he's all the way to the side... And maybe at that point, for want of a better term, there's kind of this something's being buried inside you, something's been planted in your brain, and you're not sure what. How you doing? Kane seems all right. He's even smiling a bit. He's not at his best, but he's... he's looking a bit peaky, but he's starting to kind of cough. Before you realize what really happens, your brain is already ahead of you. Your brain is going, it's in him, and it's coming out. One thing that he's certainly taking advantage of is the incredible width of the anamorphic frame. The entire cast is in this one wide shot. What could be safer than every single cast member in a brightly lit white room in a horror movie? Everything in that ship is so dark. I mean, the light Ridley Scott uses is literally the light from the torches. That's it, right? But that scene, oh my god, you could operate in that scene. And you needed to operate in that scene, but they couldn't save the patient. You go to Ash's reaction. I think that really, the key to the tension here is tracking Ash, because he's always in opposition to everybody else. It's a very short shot, and you wouldn't notice it the first time, but when you go back and rewatch it you realize, he knows that this is going to happen. There's so many more single one shots of him in this very strange off-kilter framing that really gives him this sinister surveillance kind of vibe, whereas most of the other characters, you're seeing them in groups, because they're all on the same team. You believe that this is because he has a better intuition than the rest of them about how dangerous it is and he's trying to protect them, but in fact, he's trying to protect this baby monster that he's allowed to come into the world. This son of a bitch is huge. I mean, it's like a man. It's big. Kane's son. Ash is such a dick. Ash, you hear or see anything? When you think about it, he's not an authentic being. So someone, a human person had to program him, educate him. Not only is he supposed to look like a person, he's supposed to pass as a person, because the crew didn't know. And that's what makes him the worse. That misogyny was built-in. Could kill him. Ash looks at Dallas, like, what do you think? I'm willing to take that chance. Just cut it off of him. You take responsibility? Yes, yes, I'll take responsibility. Now get it off of him. Ripley, on the other hand, is saying, I am making this call. It's my job to make this call. Ripley, this is an order. You hear me? Yes. I read you. The answer is negative. Inner hatch opened. And he says, nope, that's not gonna happen. I override you. Where does he get the idea to penetrate this woman forcibly? You know, but it doesn't logically make sense for an artificial life form to do that. He would choke her. He would suffocate her. The final choice that he makes is to just put this woman in her place. The programming... think, if we think about that, if we really unpack that, it's so frustrating. I hate him. Another thing that I think about is the tradition of dramatizations that happen over dinners, which you can see in anything from Chekov, to Ibsen, going back to Shakespeare. And I can't help but think of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." And in this case, it's the alien who's coming to dinner and shreds the social fabric of the dinner table. But the text and the subtext is totally about food, right? The first thing that I'm gonna do when I get back is to get some decent food. I can dig it, man. I'm telling you I've eaten worse food... Even when it comes to... there's this shot across the table, and you can see the cat in the background, soft focus, it's eating dinner too. Usually you know what it's made of. No, man, I don't want to talk about what it's made of. I'm eating... What's the food made of? It's made out of your fucking insides of your body. And there's just this cluster of noise. And it's almost like you're hearing it from the point of view of the chestburster. It's inside of Kane. It's fully conscious. It's about to come through him. It's first impressions of the universe are hearing these indistinct voices of all of these human beings. It's like you're in this sort of sonic womb. Now, from the laughter, comes of first sign that something is wrong. That is John brilliantly portraying the beginning of the pain within him. The reaction of everybody is so precise, so right. As soon as this guy gets sick, and he flips hand-held behind his head, you feel like you're in this completely different world. To me, Ridley's really pulling a Kubrick here. You see this in "Clockwork Orange," you see this in "Barry Lyndon." In all of these movies, you have Kubrick approaching sets and characters with a very squared off and rigid formal style. But when violence happens, Kubrick will drastically change the kind of visual vocabulary of the scene. It's this amazing choice to not see Kane's face at the very moment that he's going through the most agony. It's incredibly unnerving, and it's sort of a taste of what's about to happen 25 seconds later when it becomes one of the messiest scenes in film history. Hello, Roger, and cut, push out. It was kind of looming at us this scene, you know? Everyone was a bit worried about it for sure, because A, it'd never been done before, and there was so much preparation around it. Like much of the design work for the film, it had taken a long while to get to where they were. And I don't know how fully satisfied Ridley was. I think the egg and the facehugger worked very clearly for him. You'd have the kind of witch's fingers element of the facehugger, it's slightly kind of sort of insectile nature of it. But the chestburster was difficult, because it had to appear childlike. It had to at least kind of function. It had to be able to come out of his chest, it had to suggest the creature to come. So in a way, the design of the chestburster was governed most, I think, by function and practicality, the need the sequence as much by the flamboyance of Giger's work and then Scott's desire to create something extraordinary. They couldn't solve the look of it. Giger had a go at the chestburster, and he says he never got it right. It wasn't working. I did some design they looked like chicken, something like... like chicken without feathers. But I was not happy with. And then build up the thing, and it looked like a small dinosaur. It had versions that kind of looked like a turkey that had been sort of plucked. Just were laughable. They couldn't come up with something that was genuinely terrifying in its own right. Roger Dicken went away and developed it on his own. He was able to make it work. They had made this little puppet. Frankly, it looked like a penis and... with teeth. And they had, like, they said, and we're going to have it so that it'll just blow up, and then these teeth will come out. They were like, describing this. It's just a thing. We were going, oh, OK. I mean, they were so excited, these puppeteer people. They were... it was just hysterical. The fundamental math of the chestburster sequence is that the cast didn't know. Course, this isn't quite true. We knew that there was going to be a chestburster scene, we just didn't know how it was going to be done. John Hurt obviously knew, so they just kept him plied with red wine and cigarettes all day long. They knew they were relying on his patience to stay in that position while everything was set up. The atmosphere on the set had a certain frisson, you know, in the morning, because everybody knew that this was filmically, a sort of major scene. I don't think anybody had any idea that it would become a kind of film classic. Roger Dicken brought the chestburster to the set in a carrier bag. Blood was being loaded. All the crew was sort of donning these rain jackets because they kind of knew what was coming. In the morning, Ridley said, let's put some bits of gristle and stuff. So I sent the buyer down to the abattoir to buy a load of offal, which stank terrible. And they put it in formaldehyde for you, but it was worse. But we packed it round. And Ridley was doing it himself too. We were sticking it all around underneath. We're all up in our dressing rooms at Shepperton Studios. Harry Dean Stanton is sitting in the hall singing and playing guitar. We're up there for hours. We kept wondering, what the... what was going on? But at a certain point in time, some assistant is sent to bring them to set. And what greets them isn't a vision, it's a smell. Because over these hours, this kind of offal and produce has just been cooking under the lights. Literally, you gagged when you walked onto the set. It was so disgusting. Ridley wasn't certain how that was going to happen, how... how... how's that gonna manifest? All this... this innards of a cow and the blood, and thinking, my. What they saw was John Hurt spread out on this table with all of these hoses. Everybody is covered up in suits. The actors walk in, and they see that waiting for them. And I saw them, their faces all sort of dropped. They all sort of went like this, and their eyes got big and roamed around all over this stuff. We started to shoot the scene, and I was told I'd get a little blood on me. So we start to roll. And then what happens is brilliant. There's just this splat, almost like a bullet has hit him. He puts a pause in. You've got to kind of give the audience a chance to realize what's happened. The whole thing was really a trick in the cut. And there was a cut to the other side of the table where by which time I had been replaced by a replica body. His t-shirt pulled you know, tightly on it, and then there's gonna be blood lines on high pressure pumps. They're going to blow blood everywhere. So we start to roll, and then all of a sudden, Ridley shouts, cut. Cut. It didn't work on the first take. There wasn't much of a chestburster. It couldn't get through the damn t-shirt. Well, we found ourselves leaning in to see what the hell was going on. Second time, it still didn't go through, but it came up like that, and then went down and covered in blood. And the actors were all kind of looking like that and curious. So it was a stroke of genius that it went wrong. They still didn't know what was coming. And it reset again. Ridley just said to Nick Allder and to Roger Dicken, just get it through this time. And they added more blood, more pipelines. And this thing goes up through, splat. They fire all the pumps. When it went through, I mean, that blood just went everywhere. It was just exactly what Scott wanted. It was just this absolutely immediate visceral response. When it happened, of course, it stills you. So that's how it manifests, huh? God! And again, Nick, and again! I had leaned into a blood jet. That little blood shot me square in the face. And that's when I jumped back and I went, oh my god. And my knees hit the back of those banquette where we were all sitting, and it flipped me upside down. And I said, oh my gosh, we're still shooting. So I rolled over and I got back up, and I ran around and got back into the scene. So there were different... there were different reactions to it. And action. Blood. Blood. Enough. Push it out. Pump it. Roger Dicken had built little lungs in as well. It was a lot of stuff going on under the table to make it look so real, hung bits of stuff all over it so that it looked like it broke through the flesh and heart and muscles. That was part of Ridley wanting this to be unquestionably real. And I think that scream, when it screams, there's the Bacon shot. There's something really strange in those paintings that connects to the phobias that we carry with us to this day, and they come from our ancient past. So I think, you know, particularly the "Incubus" is one that was struck me when I read the script. Because that chestburster it comes out and sits there for a moment and screams, and that's just as you imagine an incubus would do. It would come out, sit, and scream at you. I loved that image so much, and what I see in it is something that's like a material object trying to come to life. And that's what "Alien" is. Slow. Slow. OK, and the head back. Slow, Go! Shit. Great. Cut it. Cut it. Save the blood. When I'm watching the chestburster scene on the Nostromo, and I'm thinking about how brilliantly staged it is because it doesn't take place in a dark corridor with a guy all by himself. And then decades later, Ridley Scott restages a chestburster scene and does it exactly in that way that's so much more tropey. In the dark, a guy alone being watched over only by the malevolent David, and with this smoke and lights behind him, it's almost like it's the first draft of the original scene that was rejected and then for some reason, revisited later. But on the other hand, there is something really delightful if you give into it. I feel like Ridley Scott can't find a better way to talk about his own mortality than by going back over and over to the origin side of the height of his powers and the height of his creativity. If you look at where Ridley Scott is currently taking the "Alien" cycle, he's using it explicitly to explore questions of where did life come from? What does it mean to be human? He seems fascinated by the idea that the child would destroy the parent, that the created would destroy the creator, that things we make come back and destroy us, which I suppose are variations on the Frankenstein story. But the repeated recurrence of this in his work suggests, I think, a major autistic obsession, actually. People often talk of Hollywood as the dream factory but I think the dreams that Hollywood puts on the screens are not just the dream of one person, they're collective dreams. Cinema is a window on our collective unconscious. And in that way, I think that "Alien" is an incredibly important window on what people were thinking about as of the late 1970s. When you look back an alien 40 years later, it seems prophetic of where we've gone. We're still going in the same direction that it seemed to be indicating at the time, which makes the world of "Alien," if not probable, at least, you know, looking like a possibility in the way that "Star Wars" could never be. The last act of "Alien" is escaping self-destruction. That's the myth of our times. Part of what makes "Alien" so powerful is it's so much more than an allegory. It taps into a deep set of patterns that can mean many, many, many things. I don't think we can get to the bottom of "Alien." Like a piece of sand vibrating in a somatic experiment, in touch with something deeper, Dan O'Bannon must have been on the frequency for this myth. He seems to have been a stenograph for a larger song. My husband was out of time, in a way, out of specific time. But he lives on. And when he was dying, that's what I said to him. He was not conscious. I said, you moved the world. You did it. You moved the world. And he did. In a way, I don't think Dan O'Bannon is finished yet. When he died, I had a strange feeling that he'd gone back to the future from whence he'd come. And there's still things there that are emerging from him and things that I have that are just now becoming relevant today. And there's more there. There's more there. Don't ask me why he had this connection to the past and the future, but he sure did. He came from a place that had no telephone or television and went to the stars. Went to the stars. It's inexplicable.
