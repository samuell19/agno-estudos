The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia is now in its fourth day. Yugoslavian leaders are trying to persuade the Russian government... to send its troops to join in the battle... thereby escalating the conflict still further. Despite the poor weather conditions... the NATO bombing campaign continued... In their effort to insulate a vital Kashmir highway... from guerilla infiltrators as exchanges between New Delhi... and Islamabad soured. A flurry of weekend diplomacy appeared to have fanned tensions... between the nuclear neighbors... now in their worst confrontation for almost three decades. The next generation of super weapons... to protect the prosperity of Europe... that plans to match the military might of the USA. It's believed this will affect the demands for weapons... by Third World countries. This morning, Hong Kong Police discovered 10 tons of explosives... stored in a freighter. They detained three men for questioning. Police spokesman said case was solved after a two-year undercover operation. The explosive material seized has been identified as ammonium Perch Lorate... a fuel substance for commercial and military rockets. When used as an explosive, it can cause massive damage. For this reason, it is usually transported by sea. Hong Kong Police are also searching for this man, Mak Wai Lung... who uses the alias "Dinosaur. " Mak is alleged to be connected with the local underworld. The police have reason to believe he's involved... in a highly organized international arms smuggling ring... operating out of Hong Kong. The explosives discovered today... Without all your help, wed never have solved this case. Cheers! Great work! Hello? Who is it? Will you calm down? And hurry up if you're coming over here. So, Daniel, when are you gonna get off your ass? Just tell me one thing. Did you find Wang yet? I'm hanging up! And what's this for? Were going to the Philippines, not Switzerland. I'm sorry. I didn't... Ill give you you're sorry! All you do is cry. Wai Lung. Didn't I ask you if you found Wang yet? What's your answer? Sorry. Sorry? Your sorry doesn't help me. Why don't you go the fuck back to Canada? If Mom hadn't begged me to take care of you, you'd be dead by now! Yeah, why don't you wise up? What's the matter? Cant take it? Huh? Just look at me. This scars because of you... because of you! Look! You're only alive cause you're my brother. You understand me? How could our mother have a smart son like me and a dumb one like you? - Sorry, Wai Lung. - Quit talking English! I got no fucking use for sorry! Mom sent you to Canada for school. I work my ass off to support you, and you become a gangster in Canada. Sorry? Its cause of you I'm on the run. Now the cops have the explosives, my buyers in danger. They wont let me get away with it. Listen, when I'm gone you better watch your back. You might be his next target. Don't worry about it. Ill be careful. Its still your turf here. Ill watch it for you. Are you done playing? Target located dead ahead. Stand by! Go! Hey, man, how's it going? We're here to check the CO-720 liquid fuel system. 5-22, what is it? There's a Westerner. He says he's here to check on something. I didn't receive any notice. Put him on. - For you. - Thank you. Its time. Security system now disarmed. The target is locked. You have one minute to finish everything and get away. I think I found it. Targets in the middle vehicle. Eliminate front and rear cars. Go! Step on it! Bastards! Faster! Head down to the pier! - Is everything going okay? - Sure. I met some of your men downstairs. They gave me this gift for you. - What, for me? Thanks. - You're welcome. Tooth, why are you going this way? Are you lost? No. This way is safer. Safer? Damn it! I knew I shouldn't have come with you! - What am I doing here? - Shut up! Don't get mad at me. I didn't take your merchandise! I don't even know who the traitor is! I'm in this shit as deep as you are! You gotta believe me. Lina, don't go. What do you guys want? Killing me doesn't do anyone any good. Stop running. Stop fucking running! When I was 12... I saw a ghost in my school. He was a high school student. Got hit by a baseball when he was watching the game... and just died. His face was all fat. So much blood. But he looked scared too. Said he didn't understand why he died. So, the ghost stayed in the school. Couldn't go anywhere. So I believe people should always be told... why they fucked up... or else... they would never die in peace. So, do you know why you fucked up? No? Well... think about it. Close your eyes. Take your time. From now on, we are family. I'm counting on you. When the buyer is ready, Ill come back. Just do a good job. Okay, man. No problem. What do you know about your brother smuggling weapons with the Japanese? What do you know about your brother smuggling weapons with the Japanese? - I don't know. - Really? We know you smuggle weapons to Hong Kong from China... then sell them to a Third World country at a profit. This time we intercepted your merchandise... so the Japanese killed your brother and took it back themselves. Isn't that true? Man, I told you already... I don't know. It's his own fucking business. It had nothing to do with me. Sorry. Madam missed a bit. Rewind. These meetings, next time can we make sure we keep the door locked? I don't want just any idiot walking in and out. Chan's okay, but we cant have cleaners and delivery boys coming and going. Rewind. Do you recognize this guy? He's known as Akatora. We believe he planned the entire operation. So, I'll ask you again... Do you know him? Don't waste my fucking time! Let me go. I'll find my brother's killer faster than you bastards. We pulled two bodies out of the ocean this morning. One is the gangster known as Dinosaur... and the other one is his girlfriend, Lina Chow. We arrested Dinosaurs brother, Daniel, when he got back from Macao. He used to deal drugs in the east area. He operates a network of young criminals. Me, I don't believe he's involved, but we have people following him anyway. And now, this man... at the top of the Japanese most-wanted list... known as Akatora. Fought his way up the Yakuza ranks and should be considered highly dangerous. He's utterly ruthless and fears no one. Recently, he beefed up his operation by smuggling weapons. He controls everything from here. It took two years to ID him. Once he gets this deal closed, hell ship the arms out of Hong Kong. It seems this case doesn't just concern the reputation of the police. The lives of everyone in Hong Kong are in our hands. We must rise to the occasion. Any questions? No, madam. - Madam. - Yes? l... I've studied this case in great detail, over and over... and this... I believe that Inspector To has missed something very important here. That night there were a group of bikers there that... Chan, wait. Wait. Did you take your medicine? Hey, come on, guys. I'm serious, really. That dead undercover cop was my friend. I promised him last night to avenge his death. What I mean is, in my dream. Revenge? What is this, a kung fu movie? Remember that kidnapping case when you burned down central precinct? Now you wanna do it again? Chan, the story of you torching the station is well known... but we have to obey the law. They want us to be role models for the citizens... so we cant discriminate against a reformed psycho. I'm not a madman! You don't understand. Maam. I was wondering why I don't see my name anywhere on this assignment sheet here! Okay, Customs, Immigration, OTCB, Surveillance... there are just no openings anywhere. We already have people positioned on Dinosaurs old turf and elsewhere. I really cant think of anyplace where we need you. Like Interpol, huh? I know this guy who's working in Washington. His names George. He knows everyone there. Oh, George Washington you say? Now we can ask for help from the CIA, FBI, the Men in Black. Lets stop it right here. Chan, Inspector To is in charge of this case. He already has a strategy mapped out. Lets not waste time. How about this? Ill give you a special assignment. Okay with you? But don't interfere with Inspector To, understand? Special assignment? All right! Oh, boy! Thank you, maam. 369, officer dismissed! 358, next one. 334, dismissed! Inspector Chan... are you here to choose police officers or TV show hosts? These men are the best we have. You wont find better anywhere. What kind of case are you working on? This is confidential. I hear you have some cadets here that are perfect for undercover work. They've got "cop" stamped on their face. Inspector, they're sent here after graduation. This is as fresh as they get. You're getting special treatment already. No one gets the privilege of handpicking people for special ops. Whatever you say. Don't you have a couple of guys that look a little dicier? You know, guys that have that criminal look. Then why don't you look in prison. What's this, a joke? Sir, we just got your letters. Why do you want us out? I explained it very clearly in the letter. Cant you read? Sir, as it says here, we have had some ongoing discipline problems... but who hasn't? Cant we work something out? Sir, were not the only one with discipline problems. What about the corruption matter we told you about already? We have the evidence here. If they violate the rules, then well look into it. You play tricks on your classmates. You spy on your instructors. You have many demerits. I'm through with you! Sir! Actually, you see, I'm a very good guy... and I am the top marksman in my class, so please think about it again. What do you think this is, a video arcade? And you. All you do is chase women. Why don't you go off and become a gigolo? And you. You've fought more than Mike Tyson. This is a disciplined unit. We need teamwork! Teamwork, yes, sir. We have to learn how to bend over... and then kiss your ass every day... then take you out and party and you expect us to pay the bill. Shut up! What's this attitude? You guys are street trash. How could anyone ever rely on you? You have no discipline at all. How can you make a good cop out of garbage? If were garbage, then you're the garbage that makes us all garbage. If were not qualified to be cops, then you're not qualified to be our teacher. Your fancy-looking uniform, it doesn't make you a good cop. Is this really it for us? Then if so... why don't we forget about all the things that they just said and we apologize. Stop talking! You're all finished! We do not take thieves! Now get out! I told you it was a waste of time. They don't look like police. More like criminals. They're not police anymore. What the hells going on? Later, shithead! I cant believe we spent taxpayers money training you! Come back here! Ill fight you all one by one! If I ever see your dirty faces again, Ill lock you up! Hello. It's Chan again. Have you gentlemen decided? Come on. Work with me. This is a big case. Inspector Chan, you have the wrong number. Yeah, they're about to get on the plane. Wait! Gentlemen, gentlemen. You want another chance, to be cops? I tell you, you guys are gonna be great. You look like Leonardo DiCaprio and you look like Michael Jordan. Cool, cool. You all look cool. We really need guys like you on the force. You can breathe in new life. You jacking us? Tang must be the guy who sent you here, right, fat boy? No way. I hardly know the guy. I don't know you guys either. So why should I try to fool you, huh? Your mission has got worse odds than winning the lottery. Oh, you bet its dang... So, you guys are scared. I bet Tang you'd make it, but now I see. You guys are hopeless. - Forget it. - Watch it! - Are you calling me a chicken? - What's so special about being a cop? Being a cops no big deal? Couldn't stand the training, so you quit. Why not go and become a Boy Scout? No, they go camping. Still too dangerous. I know. Cub Scout. Girl Scout. Here's a parachute. If you dare to jump, well do whatever you want. Fat boy, why don't you jump, if you got balls? Hey, fatsos chute didn't open! - What? - He jumped, but his chute never opened. - He's free-falling! - Well have to go find his body. Fatso. I jumped. Now you gotta keep your end of the bargain. How about helping me down? Wait! Wait! Guys, you gotta help me out of here! Come on. Help! Hey, you serve lobster? - What's the soup of the day? - French onion soup. Here, here. They cant read. Ignore them. Ill order. Four discount combos, maam. Come on. I haven't decided yet, so don't order for me. What's that? Be grateful were not eating in some dump. The department will pay for it. Why did you make us dress like this, to pick up chicks? Lets go. After lunch, Ill take you over to Special Operations headquarters... and after I brief you, you'll understand everything. When you hear about this mission, I'm telling you, its really... exciting. Yeah, real exciting. Chan, is that you? What's this, lunch? What a coincidence. Are these assholes with you? How dare you annoy my friend Chan. Lets check em out. Yeah. Come on. Get up. - Get up! - Quit it! What's your fucking problem, you asshole? Wait. They're on our team. What? What's that you say? They're police. These three aliens are police? My names Alien. What's so funny? Whoa. Okay. I guess you are then. Where'd you meet these guys, in a mental hospital? Sorry, sir. - We have to get out of here. - But why? Cause something round here... really stinks. It smells like shit and its reeking the whole place. Oh, shit. Do you realize that his ass is right under his nose? That's enough for me. Take em in! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Were all police! Inspector To, you know that the chief assigned this mission to me... so lets not complicate things any further, all right? Lets make a toast and let bygones be bygones, okay? Listen, Chan, if you have spare time... what you need to do is find yourself a hobby. Because you're not gonna solve anything hanging around with these clowns. There's no such thing as miracles. If they can solve this case... Ill get down on my knees and serve you a cup of tea. Solve the case. Dream on, Chan. Lets go. Massage time. All right! That was fun. Just let their insults motivate you. Come on, guys. Sit down. - Miss? - Yes? Scratch the previous order and give us lobster. Hold it, miss. Four lobsters. Its not our money. Hey, check it out. Hey, give me one of those. - Hey. Look here. - What's up? She fights well. - I hate guys who hit women. - So do something. No way. And ruin all their fun? So what's this girl got to do with the case? Nothing. I was just bored. Don't waste time. I thought she was pretty. Besides, I didn't have anything else to shoot. - Hey, where did you see this girl? - Who? That one. The one that got beat up. You told me to follow Daniel, not the girl. She's the sister of my buddy that got killed. Where is she now? How would I know? Where you been? I've been looking for you for days. - Did you go to Planet Disco? - Yeah. I believe that Daniel and Akatora were involved with my brothers death. The police don't care anymore. I've been investigating. I want to avenge my brothers death. I need to be on this case. This disco is one of Daniels favorite hangouts. He comes here almost every day. I've been working on it for almost a month. I checked every corner of this place except for the top floor. No one is ever allowed up there. Something very strange is going on. Listen. Once you get inside, head to the top floor. Get any evidence you can find, then get out. Got that? Watch your ass. Check him out. - Hey, handsome. Buy me a drink. - No, buy me one. Forget her. Buy me one. Hey, baby, looks like you're lonely. Come with me and lets get out of here. I'm gonna commit suicide at midnight. No problem. Ill pick you up at 11:00 then. - Hey. - What? Watch the cowboy. Zoom in. Should we follow him? No. Move up to the top floor. - Ready to go? - Ready. Match, this girls checking you out. Hey, Y2K, tell me where that place is. There's a door behind the dance floor with a sign saying " No Admittance." There's usually a guard there, so think of something. The boss wants to see you. You're back. Why didn't you call me when you got in? I would've come pick you up. Don't worry about it. I'm here to set things straight. Dinosaur was like a brother to me. When I find out who killed him, I'm gonna end his life. I'm putting up five million. You're gonna put up half. You better get started. What's up? Get going. Ill call you. Just dealing with some business, man. What? I thought you told me you were in the United States. Huh? How the hell did you get here so quickly? Man, you gotta stop playing with me like that. B-52. Haven't seen you in a while. What? Haven't seen you in a while. Do I know you? Don't you remember me? - Aren't you from Canada? - No. Look, lady, we have never met. Well, we can start now. What? Where's the head anyway, huh? Question... Toilets up there, right? Hey, I'm asking you something. Cant you be a little polite? What the hell are you saying? Japanese, huh? I don't speak Japanese. So now what? Listen and follow Y2K. You guys are useless, you know? I'm going to screw your family. I'm going to screw your sister... your mother and you... for my country! Don't you ever dare come back here again! Jap bastard! Motherfucker! Point at the photo. Hmm. I know him. Jack, hold it. Get out! Something's up! Get out! Now! Alien, go help Match! Asshole, help! - We lost Jacks camera too! - Shit! What's up? Show me the tape. Something good on it? I've got three men trapped in there. Either get your men out, or get them to help. Hey, calm down, boy. I'm off duty, but let me tell you... Id rather go take a shit than waste time investigating Daniel. Help me! I gotta go! You don't really think they're counting on you to solve the case? You know what? Let me tell you. I despise you, you dwarf. I need a massage. Fuck you! Could you stop flirting for once! That's the boss's girl! Fuck me? Fuck you. They beat me up and you just stood around. You're no friend. Fuck you. Everyone knows you wanna fuck every girl you meet. - You got something to say? - What do you want? - Lets take it outside. - Come on! - Hold it! Freeze! - Where are you going? Freeze! - Asshole, come and fight me. - Think you're a tough guy? So what if you can fucking fight? No ones gonna back you up. You're on your own, man. Who do you think you are? My names Jack, like in a deck of cards. You can call me Jack, or go jack off. Jack shit is what you are. Are you trying to steal my girl right in front of me? And who do you think you are? Steal your girlfriend? She was coming on to me. He says that you were flirting with him. Yeah, I was. - And? - And... I was seeing him in Toronto. He dumped me. I thought Id never forget the creep. He's gonna pay for what he's done to me. So, its payback time, huh? Stop! Remember me now? Haze. I remember you. Wong Suk May. I didn't know you were that serious. I don't wanna see him right now. Wait for me outside. Ill handle it. Outside, okay? So, you wanna steal my stuff. And your friend wants to steal my girl. Okay, no problem. Everybody makes mistakes. But, you see, you guys are fucking with me on my turf... and you trashed my club. So now I gotta figure out how to deal with you. Hey, well pay for the damage. To be honest, a million here, a million there... is less than nothing to me. The problem is you messed up my place... and if I let you go on your way... then how am I gonna face my boys? So, what's the deal? Very easy. You just have to do me one favor. "Very easy," but not enough to die for. Relax. Just help me take care of something. It'll be real simple. See it through, and then were cool. What do you say, deal or no deal? -What if we say no? -Its the only way you walk out of here! We take the deal, huh? - I guess so. - Its a deal then. Deal. Good boys. You guys wait here and chill. Tooth, get these boys a car. Send them off in the morning. So why did you dump the chick? She was hot. You gotta recycle, help the environment. Why didn't you recycle the gun? You didn't fucking think. We could have used it, but instead you trashed it. Its a Jackie Chan move. Its bad! You really wanna use those three punks? I'm gonna use those little motherfuckers as bait... so then we can come in nice and easy and take out Lok. And then, my man, everything will be all good. - No sign yet. - Let me go take a look. - You? - Don't worry. I know this place. Listen, I want you to deliver this cash to Lok. The boss will call you later. Isn't it Akatora? Go ahead. Move it. Get in there! You Lok? Here's your cash. Hello? There's a gun inside that money bag. I want you to cap that son of a bitch. Just one shot and you'll be the man. Boss! You know what to do, don't you? - Cigar? - Cool. Hey, guy, what's wrong? You look sad. Yeah, right. Did you get dumped? Pretty good. Take it easy. First cigar takes a little getting used to. What? I can smoke two at a time. - Here. Knock yourself out. - Thanks. - From where? - Cuba. I thought you bought em. I mean, where are you guys from? Were not. Just back from Canada. Canada, huh? What the hell are you, a bunch of school kids? Why'd Daniel send you? Here's your cash. Come with me. Hey, hey. What about us? You guys can go. We got time. That's okay. We can wait. Looks like everything's cool. There ain't no Japanese around. Jacks in deep shit now. It seems like that Lok guys a fag or something. Maybe this is a gay club, so watch your ass. They get their hands on you, you wont walk for weeks. Take it off. Go ahead. Put down the bag. Put this on. Your shoulders are a bit wider than Simons. Turn around. Turn around. Come on. Turn around. What's the matter? I'm not gay. Simon is my brother. You're built like him, so I let you try on his jacket. Relax. Don't be so uptight. What's your name, kid? - Its Jack. - Well, sit down, Jack. Who killed Dinosaur? You know who he was? What's up, man? Why don't you move it? My boys are standing by. If you don't kill him in the next minute... I'm gonna kill you, understand? You wanna play? Okay, lets play. Ten million. Enough? Good. Those three assholes may not be able to kill him. Shut the fuck up. If they screw up, well take him out ourselves, dumb fuck. Understood. Just tell your bitch were taking care of business! Take your jacket. You wanna mess with me? Try it. You're not man enough yet. You've got a hell of a lot to learn, kid. You see that cash? Its all fake. Unfortunately, Daniel set you up. Lok, he's got you surrounded. Go while you can. I can tell there's something special about you. Fuck! Boss, you okay? Freeze! Don't move. I have Lok, so don't anyone move! Stop! Back off! Go on! Freeze! Back off! Don't move! Nobody move! Boss, you okay? Hold it. Don't move! Here's what you wanted. Were done. Lets go. Don't go. Very good boys. I'm so proud of you all. Hold on. You're not done. I still haven't paid you. Let me tell you a secret. Remember Dinosaur? I killed him! You know something? He never once treated me like a brother. He only treated me like an idiot. That asshole paid me only ten grand a month. Ill tell you a secret. You are an idiot. So funny! You're as old school as my brother was. You need to get yourself updated, man. Come on. Loyalty? Why don't you go tell that to Dinosaur? In the real world, only money talks. You're damn right. Drop it! What are you doing, man? Okay, Ill give him to you. Now where's my ten million? Uncle Wah will give it to you. Then you assholes can get out of my face. I despise anybody who sells out his own people. After I get my money, I'm history. Don't look at me like that. Its the rules of the game. You know that. - I only get ten grand too. - You son of a bitch! Lok, no! You scumbag! You killed your own brother for money. Daniel, you're definitely an idiot! Remember when you were young and some stranger kidnapped you? Your brother searched from Shek Kip Mei to Kowloon City to find you. - Have you forgotten? - I remember. Don't kill me! The Japanese guy made me do it! So now he's your brother, is that it? Oh. And the Japanese guy, Ill get him next. You want forgiveness? Ask your brother for forgiveness. - No, don't kill me! - Lok, no! Jack, help me! He's already crippled. There's no need to kill him. This business has nothing to do with you at all. Its better you stay out of it. He killed his own brother, and his brother was your friend. So if you kill a friends brother, isn't that just as bad? So you're running things now? Attention! You're surrounded! Drop your weapons! Come on, boss. Lets go! You fuckers! Fuck! Lok, listen! Just let it go! If you wanna save him, come down and kill me. Killing me will make you a hero. Jack! Help! Police! Drop your gun! I said drop it! Oh, shit! Don't let me go! - Were moving! Do something! - You do something. Freeze! Alien! Over here! - I tell you, I'm a cop. - No! Leave her alone! She's one of mine! Madam! These are my men... and the girl too! They're with me on this case. Please don't arrest them. Hey, Chan, I don't know if these are your men or your informants. They're certainly not cops anymore, because we fired them. Maybe they're helping the bad guys more than you. - They're undercover! - Hello! One of your men escaped with Daniel. What's wrong with you? Madam, I'm serious. You must support them. You must support them, or they'll be in danger... and all our efforts will be wasted. To hire an informer we must follow standard procedure... and now everything's a mess because we have no paperwork. - Madam... - And one more thing. Didn't one of your men kill my officer? - You know that wasn't their fault! - They never had any discipline. How can you be sure? You take this trash from the street... and let them investigate such an important case? We have you to thank for this whole mess! This mess? Let me tell you something! Those kids have got guts and they're plenty smarter than you are, asshole! Madam, you made a point of giving this special mission to me, didn't you? Okay. However, you have to report to me. Make sure its according to the system. They cant just do what they want and never report in. How do you expect them to report in when they're tailing Daniel? What's the point of following Daniel? Why waste your time and our resources following two-bit punks like this? -Just think for a minute. - No, you should think! Everyone knows that Daniel is working for Akatora. Oh. You're saying Daniels covering for him. Come on! Wake up, man! This is just another gang war. What? Dinosaur talk to you in a dream? You are fucked. Akatora needs a man in Hong Kong. Daniels involved, man, and I know that he is. You should spend less time at the whorehouse, you fuckin sleazebag! - Shut up! - Or your dicks gonna fall off! Shut up! Now transfer the case files over to him. You're off this case. As of this minute, you're on leave. What's going on? Quick! Get a doctor! Take Chan to the doctor. He shouldn't be running around loose. Okay, lets carry on. Madam, I don't think we should just let them go. We should treat them as dangerous criminals. I see. - If you've enough evidence, do it. - Yes, madam. Where are you, huh? On the... On the way? You said you were on the way a half an hour ago. The clinic in Shek-O. What, do you think were having a party or something? Get over here. You got the passport and money? Find a way, all right? ...came under fire in the suspects' fierce gun battle... between two rival gangs. The shoot-out that followed left 12 people wounded and four dead... including a police officer. Police officers are now on the lookout for a 36-year-old male... Lok Wai Lan, alias "Mad Dog" Lok... and 22-year-old Daniel Mak. Those goddamn cops are useless! They couldn't kill that bastard? ...still at large and wanted for possession of weapons... and in connection with the death of the police officer. And now were wanted! Oh, no! We didn't kill any cops. - Lets call Chan. - What good would that do? -He's the one who got us into this shit. -Who is this Chan guy? What gang is he with? Don't involve anyone else. If I cant get out of this, no one can. Hello? Yeah. Yeah. I've been waiting for your call for a long time, man. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. Okay. Bye. So tell me what's the point of killing us now? The police are looking for you, and guess what... So is Lok. Were all in the same boat here, and we should all leave... instead of sitting around. Daniel, its me. - Are you okay? - I'm all right. Took your time, didn't you? Good girl! - Did you count us in? - Maybe next time. Here. This moneys for you. Gotta go. There's a lot of cops around here. Now what, huh? What? Haze, wait! Stay with me. Yo. What are you doing? Are you playing around with my woman again? I know you were back two years ago to look for me... and I avoided you. How can I take care of someone if I cant even take care of myself? I really regret it. I don't want to lose you again. Hey! - What the fuck? - Stop thinking with your dick! Fuck you, asshole! Stop! Stop it! From now on, you're all on your own! Who needs friends like you? So fighting's your idea of friendship? Haze, lets go. I'm not going, Daniel. I'm sorry, but... its him I've been looking for all this time. This, it'd never work. - I'm staying. -Just forget about the chick. Just like these two dickwads. Eat shit and die! Hey. Hey, kid. I'm dealing you in. Take the wheel. What's up? That's friends for you. Forget about it. Something wrong? Look. There is something I gotta do. Hey! Cut the crap or we wont catch him even if we fly. So you're leaving. Again. Look. I really gotta take care of this thing. I gotta go. Trust me. I wont leave you again. I promise. I cant take this anymore. If you break this promise, you'll never see me again. Hello, lovebirds. We got this stolen car thing. Can we hurry it up, please? Look. I gotta go. Chan, your people just called with interesting news. They're going to meet Akatora. I don't know if they're for real. They said they'd call again, but they want you to answer the phone. They told you that? I thought you were in charge. I love those kids. I don't have time to play around. Just sit here and answer the phone. You find out where Akatora is... and leave the rest to me. Just answer the phone? - Like a telethon. - You still messing with me? Who's messing with who, huh? Now my boys are the ones that have the lead on Akatora. In fact, we were right all along. They want me on the phone. So if I leave now, what'll you do? Your ass would hit the fan. If you lose Akatora, your name would be mud. Am I right? You're a smart guy. So do you feel that I'm qualified to call the shots in this case? Well? Am I insane? Quite so. But not stupid. Okay. What do you want? I want... Okay, now. I take control of the case. Transfer my files back to my office. Also... unless you hear from me... I don't want to see your assholes anywhere near this case. And if you fuck up, it will be on your head. Now you call headquarters now and you tell the chief... you want me to take over this case. Inspector To, did I make myself clear? What's wrong? Have I suddenly gone deaf? - Answer me. - Hey, okay. You're the boss. I really don't care. -Just get the case solved. - Bingo! And what does he win? A ton of toilet paper. Why don't you use it to wipe your mouth? It stinks. Just stick with me and you'll make it. Don't worry about those two assholes. - Those assholes. - Yo. Mr. Yanni. Yeah. Everything's under control. You got the money? Good, good. Good, good. Good. We need it all in cash, right? Okay. All right, well see you then. Good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, man. Take it easy. Were one of you. - Take them to the boss. - Yes. Sir, they just called in. Okay. Hello? - Match, where are you? - Were at a school in Tai Po. There are lots of Japanese around. I think Akatora's here. - What should we do? - Now, listen. If things get hairy, you get out of there. Jacks here. So is Daniel. We cant back out now. You're in Tai Po? Okay, we're on our way. Hello? - Did you get a trace? - Tai Po, Dai Yu High School. Call SDU. Lets go. Call SDU. Analysts predict the rise to power of Kenji Shimada. Shimada is known for his non-partisan attitudes. His ongoing fight against the Yakuza... have marked him as the ideal figure... to initiate a new era in Japanese politics. Oh, man. You don't know how glad I am to see you. Remember I said I was counting on you? Yeah, I remember. Don't worry about it, man. I'm not gonna let you down. Hey. This is Jack, my new boy. Without this guy, Id be dead. This is the boss. Sir. - Is Mr. Yanni ready? - Yeah. Everything's cool. The moneys ready, and Mr. Yanni said... hell meet you in his office tomorrow morning at 9:00. Then you can have a drink or get something to eat or... No more bullshit. Open it. Surprised? Its for you. Take off the tape. Daniel, you fucking asshole! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Yeah. If I don't, the Jap will. He's going to fuck you in the ass till you die. Understand? Bakka. Fuck you. I like this guy. Fun to hang out with. What a pity he's got to leave now. Maybe you could give him a ride. Finish him. Asshole. Dinosaur and I will see you in hell. Kid, don't be nervous. Come on. Id rather be killed by you than one of these scumbags. - Go on, shoot. - Fuck you. - What are you doing, man? - He's just playing with us. Yes, he's right. He's smarter than you. Yes, he's right. He's smarter than you. Come on, be a man. Deal with him. What are you talking about? I'm your man! Were family, right? I work for you. You are not qualified to be my family. You set me up and you've risked my life. That's bullshit. I didn't set you up! What are you talking about? Do you know he's a cop? I knew there was something special about you. I could tell the first time we met. The day you turned your back on your brother, you should have known... there would be a price to pay. Yeah, that's right. Kill him! Kill him now! -Just shut up, all right? - Gonna make me? You really are stupid. You didn't even know he was a cop. No wonder your brother used to tell me you were an idiot. Why? Why is Dinosaurs brother a pig? You're a stupid pig! I told you you'd die first. I like you too, man. You're so fucking funny. Hey, I had a dream last night. I was in hell... and I saw a lot of dead people... lining up for something. And you know what? They were all waiting to fuck your mother up the ass... and they promised to save a place for me. I cant wait. Hey. Hey, Bakka. I will give your mother a good time. Lok, no! Team "A" is approaching the pump house using an underground water duct. The entrance is about 200 meters away. Meanwhile, Team " B" is circling around. - They'll approach from the back slopes. - Good. Tell them Akatora is one weaselly guy... and my team is in there, so nobody moves till I order them. - Yes, go on. - Once the teams are in position... they will then scan the area, moving out from the playground and the office. I give the orders. Report to me. The games over. This is none of your business, so get out. If you have a problem, talk to the chief. - What was that? - I'm sorry, sir. I have my orders. Superintendent To is in command. Report control. 'A" Team in position, perimeter clear. Lo, YC, check your area. Over. Beta, move in. Don't waste any time. Control Beta, take over Alpha. - If you see any movement, take action. - Copy. Hey, man, think of those kids. They're still inside. - Your men have got to be careful. - Shut your mouth. If Akatora really is here, you wont get in without a fight. - Save my men first. - Hey, hey, hey! I'm in charge. I'm telling you, get out! Alpha Team, move in! Take out all resistance. Move, move, move! Copy. Target locked. What the... - Someone tell me what's going on! - Our team was caught in an ambush! You're in deep shit now! Your stinking people sold us out! You're dead meat now! Hey! Inspector! Come on! Those assholes are so selfish. They don't know shit. - I have killed those kids. - You should have known. What are you doing here? Where are the others? I should ask you that. Why didn't you stop To's men from attacking the school? Did you want to get us killed? Were working for you. You should look out for us! They betrayed us and you just sat there. How can you be in charge of this mission? We don't even know whether Match and Alien are alive or not. You set them up, damn it! Hey, hey, don't throw a fit. - Okay? - Okay. Hey. Something's up. That's the cowboy we saw at the disco! He's an international weapons smuggler named Yanni. He sells illegal weapons to Third World countries. His company is far more than a simple trading firm. Maybe he wants to buy the rocket fuel from Akatora. - Akatora must be in there. - Our target is on the top floor. Well sneak in the back way. - Its going down. - Where's Match and Alien? The buyers on the top floor. You two go and check it out. Ill keep a lookout down here. We have to save them first. Be careful. Cold. What is that? Rocket fuel. No shit? You've got the explosives back in your hands? Cause I gotta tell you, I thought you fucked this up. But when I heard from Daniel... which I did... I knew this deal was gonna go down... Don't waste my time. Is the visual phone ready? - Is it ready? - Its ready, sir. Were ready to transmit. Hey, big boss. Long time, no see. You're looking good, man. Nice to see you again. I hope we can cut the deal. How's it going? Our customer has just finished examining the merchandise. After they've checked it out, the money will be wired to the account. I see. - How's everything going down there? - Stuff' s wicked. Everything's kosher. Excellent. The transfer is being confirmed. All right, go ahead, man. Check your account. Good. We've received the money. Your mission is complete. No. My assignment has only just begun. My boss would like to say thank you. What's happening? Police! Police. I have killed all of Yanni's men. I'm calling the shots now. Shimada killed my father. Now he's in Hong Kong. I must take my revenge. You may regret it. The only thing Id regret would be letting Shimada live. Shimadas holding a conference at 3:00 this afternoon. This will be our best chance. Hey! Lets go! Lets go! - There's someone outside. - Get them! This way! Do you know why people are afraid of heights? Its because they are scared to fall, scared to die. They don't understand, to fear death is to limit life. I have overcome my fear... so now, when I need to clear my mind, I come to high places. Its like... I can almost touch the sky. Do you share the same feeling? You know what? In fact, I do. But I ain't the one who needs to clear my mind right now. If this all really helps you that much... why don't you and I swap places? A young thug like you deserves to live longer. Its a pity to lose you so soon. You can take off by yourself, or else I can ask my men to help you. Police! Stop it, you goddamn Jap! Are you ready to die? You know, its your bomb. It'll blow. So shoot, if you have the guts, and then well all blow up! Come on! How dare you shit on my turf! Did you ask permission? Don't you have any fucking manners? Are your parents idiots? You think you can pull that crap around here? Why don't you go back where you fucking came from? Put down your gun! Surrender! I'm not afraid of you. Lets see you shoot! You got a crazy man here. Go on, pull the trigger! Yeah! Blow it up! Then well die together! I'm so disappointed. You should have brought the real one. When I came to find Shimada... I already gave up this life... so I'm prepared to die. But you... are you ready? Throw it. Throw it! Okay, we gotta get out of here! Everyone move! Come on. Get out of here! - Don't worry about me! - Were going to glide-jump. Wait, wait! What are you doing? Inspector Chan! Don't worry. We wont let you down. I discovered Akatora's plans to kill this Shimada guy. That's him. Officially, he makes his living in the construction business... but we know he used to be a Yakuza boss... who worked with Akatora's father to smuggle weapons. Rumor has it he betrayed Akatora's father... who was killed by the police. Apparently, Shimada kept all the money for himself and went straight. I believe Akatora's come to Hong Kong in order to get revenge. What? All those bombs to kill one dude? There are enough explosives to wipe out the convention center. Hurry. We have to find the bomb. - Don't let Shimada in the hall. - Okay. Sir, take a look at this. Madam. "Akatora's planning to blow the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibit Center. If we cant stop him, everyone in Hong Kong is in danger. Whether you believe us or not, we are as positive as... Inspector To's... last HIV examination. Be careful. What do you think, Inspector? I didn't have a test. I mean about Akatora. I don't trust these jerks. Smells like a trap to me. You think so? It seems these kids know exactly what they're doing. Well send someone to look into it. Before today's press conference begins... please proceed to your seats and enjoy a special performance... by our talented Japanese drummers. Jack, we found the truck, but its not here. Over. If were right, Akatora plans to kill Shimada here. He's willing to blow up the building. We have to find the bomb or hundreds of people will die. Got it. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Shimada will arrive shortly. - Anything? - Nothing. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Shimada will arrive in a minute. The tiger is out. Y2K, get Shimada out of here. And please hurry. Mr. Shimada, please don't go inside! - What do you want? - Wait. Let her speak. Akatora's here to kill you. Too many innocent people will die if you don't leave. So he's finally come for me. Attention please. I'm sorry to announce that today's conference has to be cancelled... because Mr. Shimada has been unavoidably detained. I'm sorry to announce that today's conference has to be cancelled... because Mr. Shimada has been unavoidably detained. Lets go for it now. Mr. Shimada, hurry! Jack, we got it! We found the bomb! Get your ass down! - Drop the gun! - Behind you. Drop the gun! See? I wasn't lying. Here's your big chance. You guys are more stupid than I thought. Step aside. You play at being a cop... but I don't think they treat you as one of their own. There was one, but you killed him. I am a cop. Lets talk about being stupid. All this for one guy, and you cant even find him. History belongs to the winner, and I will win. Were the ones who have Shimada, so you are history, asshole. You have a big mouth, but a smaller gun. I don't mean to be in your way all the time! But I guess were just meant to be. If you really want Shimada that bad, Ill take you there. Give it up. Its game over. Over for you, perhaps. We still have unfinished business. Thirty years ago, you and my father... were outlaws together. But you worked for the cops as an informer. That's why my father was arrested and tortured to death! You killed my father! Finally, you get a chance to pay for it! You're wrong! I regret your fathers death. But he was the real traitor. He deserved to be punished. Enough! I don't care about the truth anymore. In this world, there's no such thing. All right, that's it! You're under arrest! I began the countdown 15 minutes ago. In five minutes time, the bomb will go off. Everyone here will die... unless you can take this detonator. Fuck you! I'm falling! Got it! I'm holding it! Get me out! - What do you think you're doing? - Give it to me! -Just get my legs! - Keep still, damn it! -Jack, I got it! - Don't let go! I'm falling! Oh, shit! I got you! Nothing can stop it now. Run, if you want to. You cant outrun your fate. Its people like you who screw up this world! Doesn't life mean anything to you? - We can still make it. - No. There is no time. Only time enough to die. Lets bolt! This car has a key in it! - Hey! - Hey, help! - Help! Over here! - Were drowning! Wow! What happened? It was brand new! Hey, come on! Start the boat, you old man! - Who are you guys? -Just drive and shut up! - Move it, man! - Are you deaf? Move! Listen here, young men. You be polite or I wont start the engine. Whatever you say, good man. Get us out of here, please, sir? Hey, kind sir, can you please start the engine? When I was a young guy, I was stronger and better than you. This feels good! I haven't felt this good in a long time. This is the life! The only thing that would make it perfect is an iced cappuccino. What are people working so damn hard for? - No worries, mate. - Yeah, I'm down with that. No competition, no worries, just very, very comfortable living and... Hey, what are you guys doing? You're supposed to be picking up trash, and you're lying around sunbathing. You three guys are going to jail. Even if you clean the whole beach, it wont bring back the convention center. - And what are you doing here? - Me? I'm visiting them. Don't you know you're out on bail? Hey, what are you riding us so hard for? We just saved the planet. Yo, Match, I heard on the news that Chan drifted all the way to Hawaii. - He's a lucky guy. - Inspector To! Over there. This letter is to show that we've decided not to prosecute. - You guys come with me. - So you're not going to charge us? Are you hoping to come back to the force? You got lucky this time. Maradona will visit Hong Kong from Argentina next week. They want you to be his bodyguards. If you do a good job, we might let you back on the police department. What the singer, Madonna? But I thought she lived in the US. She means Maradona, the football player. I don't think so, but thanks anyway. Hey, hey, hey. What's the matter with you? Enough. I don't have time for games. The governments serious about this whole situation. Come now. We are formally inviting you to come back to the force as soon as possible. Okay? - Perhaps we could consider... - What do you want? - How about Hawaii? - Okay. No problem. - What about you? - You cant really help me. The only thing I want to see is... Okay, okay, okay, okay. You bastard! What took you so long? What? I was arrested. What's your request? You made a bet with Chan earlier on... that if we solved the case, you'd serve him a cup of tea. So Ill tell you what. Ill accept it. - Okay. Give him some tea. - Yes, madam. - Why don't you ask me what I want? - And what do you want? Lets see. I don't know.
