- Dearly Beloved, you can expect that there to be obvious signs of progressive degeneration as the brain cells continue to deteriorate, beginning with the thought processes, decision making and short term memory. The progression of familial Alzheimer's varies from person to person, from person to person. Familial Alzheimer's. Familial Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's. - Bryan? - It was the dream again, wasn't it? - Should I get you home? - No. - I have to get back to mom. - Bryan! Bryan, Bryan. It's me, it's Hope. Can you hear me? Open your eyes. - Grams. We'll be out in a minute. ♪ My love is like the red, red rose ♪ - Hi, beautiful. Hi. - Do you know who I am? Not so much today, mom? - Bryan, that shirt's a mess. Don't you ever iron? - Not unless the occasion calls for it, Grams. Hi. - Watch what you're doing, she's more imbalanced in the evenings. - I've got her, she's fine. You're shoving her along. - I'm not. Just be careful. - Yeah, I forgot, no one can take care of her quite like you, Grams. Don't be so childish. Here, let me have a hold of her. You stay here while I get her settled. Go on now. It's alright Breen, Momma's here and I always will be. Got your Mom to bed. If you want some dinner, there's still some chicken in the oven. - Been a long day, tired. - Bryan, when it comes to your Mom, I need... No, I demand perfection. We're talking about her life here. - Hers or yours? Never mind. I shouldn't have come home this soon, disrupting you and mom. I'm gonna head back out for a while. - Who's disrupting whom? What? - It just seems to me that you, young man, want to go all out and buy that expensive ring. Happily plan a life with that Hope girl. And your Alzheimer's Mom and old divorced Grandma are selfishly holding you back, disrupting your life of sheer contentment. - Is that what you think? - Maybe. - She was so smug, harsh. I mean it wasn't her typical I'm Grams and I can do everything better than everyone else. No, this was different. Something more is gnawing at her. I don't know what to do. - It's tough, worrying about both your Mom, your Grandma and oop. - Sorry. - That's all right. You're also thinking about us, aren't you? The future? - Sometimes it's hard to see the future through the present. - Is there even a remote chance you could be wrong? Well, I'm not surprised. I guess getting absolute confirmation, just wasn't quite ready for it. - I have a few more tests that I want to run, Anne, and then we can get together to discuss in full your treatment options. It's imperative now that you contact your family and let them know what's going on. You'll need their support. - Pull it together. Pull it together. God's special gift, my smart happy girl, who was so excited about life. Alzheimer's has taken so much away from you and from all of us. You loved your dancing. I told you no. Are you two all right? - She thinks she's going to work. I couldn't orient her, hey. Here, let me have her. - No, we're fine, I have this. Mom. - No. - Breen, honey. You haven't worked in a long time. - No, but I got called back and well, there's, um, there's a meeting, there's a meeting I have to go to. - At night? - Yeah, it's a long way. Mom. You okay? Who's that? - Someone very special. She's quiet now. More quiet than ever. Sometimes I miss her voice, I miss her laugh. She's all I ever had and now, I don't even know who she... I mean when most people suffer, that's it. They suffer, they mourn, they move on, they find closure, but with Alzheimer's, it's a slow, painful daily loss. Like there would never be closure, only loss. I'm losing a... I'm losing a piece of her each and everyday. - I know. - You asked me... - Asked what? - About the pills. I mean I won't lie, the pain was intense and it - That's okay. I was able... And the thought of you having to go through this with me. It was just plain selfish of me. - Selfish? Really? I mean selfish would be me not loving you well in the hard times. I want to hope I believe just as sacrificially as you do your mom now. - What? - You heard me. Yeah. - I just can't begin to tell you what you thinking like that does... Okay, just because your mom has it, doesn't mean you will too. I mean your grandma doesn't, right? Babe, please, I, I don't want you to struggle and I certainly don't want you to think I'd be better off without you. I love you with all my heart and I'm not. I'm not going anywhere. - How do you not understand this? How do you not get this? I'm trying to protect you. - I don't need protecting, I need you. - Do you know anyone here? - No, that's the point. I've got an idea. Could we have you help us with something? - My mom isn't here right now. - That's okay, we just need you. - Do you remember how to use your fork? There you go. Now how about you take a bite and let me see you're doing all right. Good job. My word. If that boy of yours has forgotten his key again, I'm gonna ring him. It's cold in here. What are you doing? Does your Mother know you're over here? They say she, they say you should come help. Who said, George? Come on. - My little sister ran in the forest to find her puppy and I don't know where she went and we're new here. Can you please help me? Thank you. Breen, I'm back. - Riley! Breen? Breen! Breen! What? I said it was a lapse in judgment. What else you want from me? - I want what's best for mom. That's what I want. What if this happens again? - It won't. - How do you know? - I just do. - Well, I think it's probably best to start making other arrangements. - For heaven sakes. Bryan, I have to help your mom get bathed and ready for bed. Honey, the drama now is beyond overkill. I don't have the time for it, not right now. - Found you. - You did indeed and I'm glad. You know why? - Why? - Because I get so afraid without you. After all, you are my super superhero. Seriously, I could get lost. - Mom, I could never lose you. - I want babies. Maybe lots of them. - Okay, you are officially scaring me right now. - Why do you always do that when I touch you there? - Just not comfortable with it. - Those scars mean nothing to me. That's not your life any more. - Grams and her issues, mom and the Alzheimer's, my dad up and leaving, now grandpa leaving. When the outside pain got intense, I could... You know. No one can predict what's gonna happen to your mom and gramma, any of us. We can only know about today. This moment. - Sometimes I don't even know that. - You don't have to have it all figured out.

I'm heading to the hospital. I have to get some help. - Well how are you going? Are you calling Bryan? Because I really can't see doing this yourself. - Calling Bryan is the last thing I'm gonna do. I called a cab. I don't want Breen upset, so I'll just go and get checked out and I'll right back. - I understand, you go ahead and go on, take care of yourself, get well. We'll keep Breen company, okay? - I hope you feel better. - Bryan, no. It's Evelyn from across the street. I wasn't suppose to call you, but I'm really very concerned. - What are you doing here? It's bad, isn't it? - They're running tests. The doctor should be here any minute. - Did she call you? - No one called. I was making rounds and I ran into her. - I knew something was up with her.

I'm in a hurry, I've got a lot to do. - If you two will excuse me for just a minute, I wanna go check on something. What's the emergency? - I'm just tired, it's no big deal. When you're rude to my guest it is a big deal. - You mean the same folks who had a hand in breaking into our home? No, the same folks that came to watch your mom when I went to the emergency room. - George and Evelyn and those girls, I... - Now listen here, that poor soul didn't even know what he was doing. Those girls tricked him and they admitted it when they got caught trying to do it to somebody else. Evelyn and I have made up. Let it go. - You guys are all in there drinking tea, acting like nothing is wrong. Meanwhile, mom's nowhere is sight. Where is she? She's sleeping soundly. - Sleeping in the afternoon? Great.

I appreciate it. - Hey, chief, what's up? - Just out for a spring drive. Good way to cool my head. - What's got you burned up this time? - Anne, Tawnie, lots of things, I guess. - You walked away from things a long time ago, James and I'm not sure... - And nothing! It was horrific to be around. Literally felt as if I was going to snap. - We've known each other a long time. - Yeah, even before you got this job working on Sundays. - There's been a lot of bad things said and done over the years. It's over with Anne, I know that, but you still have a chance to make a difference with Breen and with Bryan. Don't wait until it's too late. Sweetheart, I let you wear those every weekend because we weren't doing anything. Today we need to change. Breen, honey, will you let me help you? - This is fine. - Breen, honey, today's important. I have an appointment to go to. Evelyn's coming over to be with you. - No. - You have to change. - No, these are my clothes and I won't let you or the army steal them. - How about you at least let me brush your hair? Come on. - They blew a hole in the wall. That way they can crawl in when night, um, when, when night, when night comes. They look at me with black eyes. - I know it's a lot to consider, but would you at least contact a family member? - There's a lot at stake, so it's best if I just keep it to myself for right now. - It is your decision, but I must inform you that you should have this procedure as soon as possible and even with the surgery, you most likely will still need treatment. - I know and I'll need a family member to bring me back and forth. I've heard it all before. - I know, Anne and I'm adamant. - I'll contact you with my decision about the surgery. - There's your parents and you when you were 14, you see? Breen, you see? Look at the picture, see? Look at that. Hi, how are you? Well, I would like to stay a little while longer, but George's case worker's going to be dropping him off soon. - Thank you for everything. Especially for getting my girl to change her clothes. I love doing it. And when you get a breather, I would like to hear everything, okay? - Up for a walk, kiddo? - Wanna go for a walk with your mom? She's right there. See? ♪ I will come again, my love ♪ Though it were 10,000 miles - You can expect there to be obvious signs as the progressive degeneration of the brain cells continues, beginning with decision making and short term memory. - Thank you. - But the progression of familial Alzheimer's disease varies tremendously among individuals, so that it could take some time before you see this in a substantial way. This type of inherited Alzheimer's is... Wait, wait, wait, wait a second. Did you say inherited? Yes. - Yeah, but sometimes those things skip generations, right? I mean, Breen's got her grandad's eyes. - Well, mutations on three genes have been linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease. For instance, a gene labeled PS1 may be responsible for 30% to 60% of early-onset Alzheimer's cases. - Wait, wait, you're saying genes, really screwed up genes are responsible for the hell my daughter is about to go through? - It's a bit more complicated than that. - My mom and sister both had the disease. Sis was only 40 and... - That's right, your genes, yours, not mine, yours. No, I don't believe this. Our daughter has a full productive life. It's gotta be stress or something else, it's gotta be. Mr. Loslee, I really think... - Wait, James, I have more questions. - No, no more questions. We're getting another opinion. - Hello, earth calling. There you are. Hey, do me a favor. If you're gonna do any more of that research thingy, would you do it in the other room? I'm crashing. And be a doll, turn out the lights before you go be that mad scientist. - You know they do all sorts of transplants and things now, right? What if they gave her a new brain or something? What if they do it right. - Seriously? - It's wishful thinking. There's nothing wrong with it, it happens from time to time. - Still you'd think there'd be a cure by now. This country that I served and sacrificed for can put a man on the moon, or at least fake it in the desert, but they can't cure a brain illness? - Well, it's not for lack of trying, I'm sure. You have to have faith that eventually... - Faith? You have to have it to lose it. I don't need faith, I need results. And this research is the one thing that brings me some hope. - And how's that working out for you? - You know when it first started, she would just forget every now and then there was a problem, you know? But I could still talk to her. Make her understand, I still had my girl. - And now? - The last time, she didn't know who I was. - But you knew who she was. Your own flesh and blood. A beautiful child of God with a blessed and amazing purpose. - Purpose? What is my family's purpose? My daughter is practically a vegetable now, and Anne, well we won't even get started on that woman. And my Grandson, the drug addict. - Bryan's been clean for some time now. He's been instrumental in Breen's care. - Still the whole thing is just broken. - You feel that way because you want to be in control and this research shows you want to have control. So? - So you can't always have it that way. Sometimes life comes at you and you just have to accept it as it is. You have to understand what you can and cannot change and trust that God will strengthen you for the rest. You just have to ask. - I can't bow before someone I don't believe in anymore. - So I know you're not pro nursing home, but I appreciate you checking it out. So does Hope. - Well, I love her poetry, so making an exception just this once. - Maybe the nursing home might grow on you, you think? - First the eye, then the hand, the rest came simply after that. Smiles and laughs filled the days with wonder. Seasons start and seasons end. Tasting like salt they ran down. Arms wrapped tight around, shoulder to shoulder, standing strong. Seasons change again. Silence, distance, strangers met, tolerated only for a glimpse of what had been. Many seasons, one choice to join hands. - You're really bad. Incoming! - Wait, Harold. Harold. Wait, Harold. Harold. Harold. - Did you hear me, soldier? Alert your men. Now, now, now! The enemy's on the move. - If I'm dreaming right now, don't even think about waking me up. - You're not dreaming. Tonight was great though, wasn't it? And the part with the war hero rushing in to save your life. - Yeah. For the time I can see a light for all of us. Whoa, whoa, wait. We're gonna do this right. - Off playing the martyr again? Maybe it was Anne, were you making a house call? - For the love of everything holy will you please just shut up! For once in your life! And don't even think of throwing that. Not that one! Why, did Anne give it to you or was it Breen? Leave her out of this. - Look, it's not my fault your first attempt at family failed. Your dream is dead. - Don't push me. Not a wise thing to do. - Ooh, I'm shaking. - What do you know about this anyway? What do you know about anything? Ice princess. Yeah? - I'm talking. - Well that doesn't mean I'm listening. - You, my dear, know nothing of dreams, sacrifice, loss, family! You know nothing of what I've been going through. Never have. You care more about that ugly picture than our relationship. - This is art. - Of all the heartless... - Listen, don't you bad mouth me under your breath. I rescued you from that nightmare. I gave up the best three years of my... - This, this is your best? I'll make you a deal. You quit being a selfish baby and I'll quit talking. - Listen, I'll make you a deal. I'll just leave, how's that? - Fine! - I'm outta here. This was never a real relationship anyway.

Nothing wrong with having a little insurance. Just playing it safe. You hungry? No, not right now. I'm gonna run out to the car. - Everything all right? - Yeah. Just getting your mom's medications refilled. - All of them? - Just started doing it recently. Can't have her running out. I was wondering if you'd sit with her while I'm gone? - You mean you're trusting me? - Can you help me or not? I won't be long. - I was relieved to hear those were yours. When I thought they might be Bryan's I just got this sick feeling all over. - I'm sure. - I'm just glad they found them for you. - You have no idea. Anyway, I won't keep you any longer. Need to get back to Breen. I know you understand. And also, Hope, like I mentioned earlier, this is really embarrassing for me. Can we please keep this between us? - Absolutely. I'm back. - We are just dancing, woo hoo. - Well, I guess you had fun. Do you wanna dance? - Breeny, babe, I'm not young, maybe later. I'm a little wiped out. I can dance. - Where you going? - Nowhere, just out. - Bryan, if something were wrong, I mean... You know you can come to me, right? - Yeah, right. - Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. No, no. Thank God. - I heard about Tawnie, I'm sorry man. - You're sorry? Come on Collin, you were never a fan of Tawnie. - No, but I can still be sorry about it. - I walked the trails down at the park this evening. Hadn't done that in many years. It was like visiting a sad old friend. Someone I'd dismissed and neglected. - I don't suppose the park holds much joy for you with Breen. - Not much holds joy for me anymore. Deep down not even Tawnie, if I'm honest. Tell me where God went. A wise old Highlander once told me that if I was still and listened close, I could hear God's voice among the hilltops, and for a while I did. - He's here more than ever. And he's just waiting and wanting to talk to you. That's why you keep coming back to this very spot. - One man's opinion. - Faith is the substance of things hoped for. The evidence of things not seen, you know that. - No offense Collin, but as I said before, I'm all faithed out, and I didn't stumble in here to be preached at. - Sorry, James, I didn't mean to preach at you, but you asked where God was, I was trying to give you an answer. - Yeah. fine. I guess all I really wanted was vent. Tawnie's gone and things are sinking fast. - They don't have to. Breen is here, your family is here, they need you, you can always help them out. - I don't have the strength right now for them. You and everyone, and what, God? Him, too. You all need to understand that... Just wanted to vent, you know? - Anytime James. You know I'm always here. - Looks like someone's in a better mood. - Yeah, I went for a drive, got my head clear. So all's well that ends well? - I guess. - We saved some chili, if you're hungry. - Nah, I'm gonna go to sleep. Been a long day. - It certainly has. What matters most is that you stay put. That's what's most important. - So tell me, are you my father? Son? Friend? Stranger? - I've been all those things at some point. - Well, whoever you are, I like you. - I like you, too. - I see that Bryan took out Breen this afternoon earlier. - Yes, they went to the park. - And you're okay with that? - No, not really. I'm just trying to keep Bryan happy. If I can do that, his focus isn't so much on the nursing home. But it seems like your family is doing really well right now. - And it's going to stay that way. What do you mean by that? - I mean, if Bryan gets himself in a tizzy again over his mom, I've got an ace in my back pocket to bring him down. I'm just a woman fighting to keep her daughter. I mean, her life was blessed with the dancing and all. I just flat refuse to let her life end in some dark, cold nursing home. You doubt me? Anne, I don't doubt you. It's just that I want you to be realistic about things. I mean Breen's health is deteriorating and what with your condition right now. - Evelyn, I appreciate your concern, but I can handle it. All of it. - What? I, I wanna go home. - Sure, okay. Yeah, we'll go home, we'll go right now. Mom, what's wrong? - This is not the way to the bus station. - Mom, our home is nearby. We don't need the bus. - Don't be silly, I live miles from here. - Mom, we're in Indiana right now, in Connersville. - This is not Indiana. - Mom, I promise you, this is Indiana. - Hey. - I promise you. - No! Are you all right? Yes, we're good. You don't look all right. - I said we're fine. Yes, hey, it's okay, mom, we're right here. No. - I don't think the little lady wants to go with you. - Help, help, help, I'm being kidnapped! Help! - This is my mom. She has Alzheimer's. Anybody wanna help me get her to the car? Anybody? That's what I thought. Hey, mom, it's okay, it's okay, hey. Let's get in the car, I'll drive you home. - To Connersville? To Connersville, yes. - Okay. - Okay? All right, here we go. You sit down right there. You okay? - Yeah, Grams, it's me. Yeah, everything is fine, all right? I just wanted to let you know that I'm taking mom for a drive. - I see. Well, I know she's in good hands, so we'll just see you both soon. - Yeah. - I mean she was cool about it, too cool. - I told you she trusts you and would come around in time. - Yeah, but it's so weird. I mean, she has never been that nice to me before. - Don't question it, just think maybe we can move forward with our lives now. Be thankful. - Maybe. - Hey, time out, I need a quick break. Whoa, fetch. Hey, babe. - Tell me to go fetch. - What are you doing with your grandma's pills? - What? - The pills. - Let me see those. - They're the ones that got dropped at the nursing home. They called me, I called called your house, your grandma told me they were hers. What are you doing? - Sugar. - What? - Nothing. Listen, I'm gonna run you home, I'm gonna drop these off at Grams. - Okay, anything wrong? - No, I want these out of the car. Grams. What on earth? Care to explain these? - Well. - No, save the excuses. Hope told me everything. Before you start talking about Hope, she didn't tell me on purpose. Why would you put a bag of sugar pills in my car? - Maybe the better question is why should I have to go around with a bottle of sugar pills? Needed to keep you away from these is why. And to spare your mom from knowing what a disappointment and failure you are. - So what? You got those from Hope. Why would you switch them? Seriously, I wanna know. - That doesn't matter. What does matter is these sure look a whole lot like the ones you stole from your grandfather's home. The ones that nearly killed you. I can't believe you. - Yeah, well maybe you should just try explaining these to your grandfather. Or better yet, the police. - You gotta be kidding! - Hey, gorgeous. Looking to catch a ride? You've gotta be kidding me, look. - Your mom's not in her room. - What? - As in, not in her room, as in gone! I'll call the police. - Folks, we want to thank everybody for coming out today. We appreciate you concerned citizens banding together to give us a hand. Officer Perkins has some instructions for you here. He'll give to you. Just be safe and stay together, if you would. I've got a one mile radius marked off here. It's where we oughta probably concentrate the search. - Okay. With the two teams, we're gonna divide up into. Very important that you listen to these instructions. I wanna make sure everyone stays safe. As you search, make sure you stay together. We don't need anyone to wander off and get lost also. Team one, if you could find a team leader to make sure that they are in charge. Team two, make sure you have a team leader. As you search, make sure you search all the buildings. Team one, you're gonna go off this way. You see all the buildings, make sure you go in them. Make sure you search everywhere. Team two, you're gonna go off this way. As you see, you also have some vehicles, make sure you search them and in the buildings. Make sure you stay safe, that is important. If you find anything, make sure you contact us, work your way back to this point. This will be the main contact point for us. If you find anything, let us know. You guys have any questions? Okay, team one, you can take off. Team two, you take off. - It's okay. Watch your step. A woman called and reported seeing them pull into a grocery store parking lot. She recognized the description you gave of your daughter. - Thank you, Jesus. - I'll call Bryan. Thank you. Pick up, Bryan. You've reached Bryan Loslee. - Voicemail again. It must be off. Why, maybe to keep you away from these is why. And to spare your mom from knowing what a disappointment and failure you are. Just think, maybe we can move forward with our lives now. Be thankful. You need to stand up and be the man that your father wasn't and that your grandfather is having difficulty being. - Hello. Hello. Hey, you can't park here. Hello. No. Yeah, yeah, I need an ambulance at Roberts Park, right away. I can't believe this, any of this, what you did. - All right, that's enough already. Give me a break. - Give you a break. You kept those pills as insurance to use against Bryan in order to keep Breen, and when the time was right you went straight for the kill. You're a monster. - Don't you dare talk to me that way. - I had those pills, I had them with me. The nursing home called me and so I called Anne, she told me they were hers. This all started because of those pills and it's all my fault, why didn't I just not say anything? - It's not your fault. Okay, listen. - You know that boy's only been clean a couple of weeks. That's like setting a liquor bottle down in front of an alcoholic who's been to maybe one or two meetings. Yeah well, crying's not gonna save you. I don't buy your emotional tricks anymore. And furthermore, I want you to know if our grandson dies, this is all on you and your twisted ways. - It's not your fault. None of this is your fault. - I just... I love him so much and he's so good and wonderful and kind and he cares so much about everyone, truly he does and he's tried to be strong for so long. - I know he has fought his demon so long and so strong. - At least I gave him a roof over his head. That time he came out to see you, you turned him away. - Yeah well, that's because I was an idiot. I wasn't thinking of anyone but myself. But I do care about that boy, regardless of what you might think. - You say you care about him, having barely been around him. You have to understand my love for Breen and why I did what I did. I don't want to lose her. - Listen, no matter how bleak this looks, I promise God has his hand in this. - You don't want to lose Breen, yet you don't care that she might lose her son. How deep does his pain have to be that he thinks cutting deeper will help? - And we must hang on in faith and pray for a miracle. - How is he, doctor? - He lost a moderate amount of blood, which we were easily able to stop. However, he did not cut an artery, so that's a good sign, but the wound is deep. So he will need to stay in the hospital for a few days. Just so we can check for infections or complications. But he will need to remain here, so they can have a psychiatric evaluation. Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much. - Can we see him? - Well, one at a time and only for a moment. - I'm here, right here. Bryan, honey, can you hear me? Please let me see your eyes. Thank you, God. Bryan, it's me, it's Hope. You're in the hospital. - Why? - Okay, you're gonna be okay. - Where's my mom? - It's okay, we found her, she's safe. - I messed up. It's over. - No, no, not at all. - Grams. I failed. - Well Collin, this is how it was meant to be for my family. My ex has a secret that could affect us all, Bryan's near suicide and my daughter's lost in her own little world of chaos. And I'm at strike two in relationships. - I don't pretend to know the ways or hows of God. What I do know, is that everything seems to work for good for those who love the Lord. - Well, that is what the good book says. You know, Collin, none of it really matters, not the ribbons or the dancing, or any of our one time dreams. The real dance goes on. It's just too bad that it took all of us being alone and getting here to figure it out. - James, you're not really alone. All you have to do is ask for the Lord. Speak to him from your heart. He's here. Bryan, this is just a setback. - No, it's not just a setback. Look at me. I've no business starting a family and with you. I don't deserve you. - Stop. - I'm so tired. I'm so tired. Wait. Hope. Thought you'd be here with the home wrecker. - She's not here, not any more. - Why'd you wanna meet me out here? We need to talk. - About? - Doctor Watkins spoke to me. Is it Bryan, is he okay? - He's resting. But she said under the circumstances we should talk, she didn't say what about. So do you wanna tell me what's going on? - It's nothing, nothing at all. - Don't tell me that. I can tell by that look in your eyes there's something wrong. - Why can't you just leave it alone, James? It doesn't concern you. - Because I can't. And it does concern me if it affects our daughter. Now for the last time, Anne, are you gonna tell me what's going on with you? We need to get everything out in the open, if we are all going to move forward. - It's cancer, okay? The cancer is back. Satisfied? - Well, it's not to the point where it can't be treated, is it? - I'm not having treatments or surgery. Why? - Why? Everybody keeps trying to take Breen away. If I have trouble with the treatments, I'll probably lose her, and I might as well be dead anyway. I don't have anything else. - That's not true, that's just not true. You and I will always have Breen, even if she's not with us. We also have Bryan. - We? - Look, it's not about us anymore, but it can still be about them. I'm here for the family. ♪ Fare thee well a while ♪ And I will come again - Breen honey, you have to be gentle - Stop. You shouldn't, you shouldn't do that. - She's fine. - I don't know what to say to you. - Yeah. - What I did was wrong. I know that now. But at the time it just made such sense. By holding onto the pills... - No. I get it. You know I hadn't taken those pills in a long time. - But honey, why were you keeping the pills? Help me to understand. You know, you look like your mom. And you've gone above and beyond in trying to help take care of her. But Bryan, she's mine, too. I can't let her go. - Even if you know it's what's best? - I'm selfish, I know. - Excuse me, my daughter has Alzheimer's and her son is a patient here, right there in room 341. I have something really important to do and I was wondering if you would mind keeping an eye on her while I step out for just a minute. - Sure, I'll be happy to do that. And you said that was your daughter with Alzheimer's? - Yes. - Yeah well, once you get past pronouncing that word, you realize that was actually the easier part. I'll be happy to look after her. - Thanks. Anne, what's wrong? - Leave me alone, just let me go. - Seriously. - I can't do it, okay? - Can't do what? - I just, I just can't. - Talk to me. - I can't let her go. Dear merciful God in heaven, I know I need to. I've known for a long time, but I just can't. - Okay, it'll be all right. Everything'll be all right. Look, do you wanna really help Breen? I mean really help her. You've gotta get past your emotions and fight the right battles. The cancer, you know what to do. - I don't want her with strangers. People pointing and laughing. Getting irritated with her. She needs to be able to see Bryan. - Look, just because she's getting care elsewhere, it doesn't mean you've abandoned her. You and I both know things between us will never be like they were. But I promise, I'll keep the family connected. The entire family. For her sake. For all of us. - I'll write everyday. You don't have to do that. - You don't want me to write? - Well, don't be silly. I just don't want you to waste all that money on postage. Since I'll be living so close and all. - I'm completely lost. I took an apartment close to the rehab center. - Okay, Mr. Loslee, here are the doctor's care instructions. Now we've already gone over this, but do you have any questions for me? - No, thank you, nurse. Now what? An apartment? - Okay, look, I know our wedding plans are on hold and just on hold, but you're still my soulmate and I'm not going anywhere. Let's just take things one day at a time and don't even try talking me out of this, Bryan Loslee. Besides, I've already paid my first month of rent. - You're too good to me. - Let's get going. - Grams, I... - You don't have to explain. The people at the center are really nice. You just go and get better and hurry back to us, okay? - Mom? You stay strong, okay? - So I like to come over for breakfast. They have a very good breakfast plate here. So how has things been? - Can't complain. Anne decided to go to Indy for treatments. She's staying with her brother. Bryan's doing well at that rehab center, Hope is nearby. Still planning a wedding, just don't know when yet. - I'll be ready. - That just leaves me and my girl here. For now we're just taking things day by day. Learning to lean on God once again. Gonna keep this family together for as long as we can. I'm not losing Breen. That's the goal. - That's good to hear. I'll be here if you need your vent. I'm not the only one listening, you know? Sometimes God has a way of blessing us right out of our mess. - Thanks for everything, Collin. - My pleasure. ♪ Just follow your dreams ♪ You just got to believe ♪ You just got to ♪ Just follow your dreams ♪ You just got to ♪ You just got to believe ♪ You just got to ♪ Just follow your dreams ♪ You just got to believe ♪ Got to ♪ You just got to ♪ Just follow your dreams ♪ My love is like the red, red rose ♪ ♪ That's newly sprung in June ♪ My love is like the melody ♪ ♪ That's sweetly played in tune ♪ ♪ As fair art thou, my bonnie love ♪ ♪ So deep in love am I ♪ And I will love thee still, my Joe ♪ ♪ 'Til all the seas gang dry ♪ 'Til all the seas gang dry, my dear ♪ ♪ 'Til all the seas gang dry ♪ And I will love thee still, my love ♪ ♪ 'Til all the seas gang dry ♪ 'Til all the seas gang dry, my love ♪ ♪ And the rocks melt with the sun ♪ ♪ And I will love thee still, my dear ♪ ♪ While the sands of time shall run ♪ ♪ But fare thee well, my only love ♪ ♪ And fare thee well a while ♪ And I will come again, my love ♪ ♪ Though it were 10,000 miles ♪ Though it were 10,000 miles, my love ♪ ♪ Though it were 10,000 miles ♪ And I will come again, my love ♪ ♪ Though it were 10,000 miles ♪ I will come again, my love ♪ Though it were 10,000 miles
