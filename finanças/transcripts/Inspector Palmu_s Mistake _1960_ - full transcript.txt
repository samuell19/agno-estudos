My mask seems to be pretty good? Yes, sir. It is good. I presume it's meant to scare? Those candles will do, Butler. Close the doors. - Evening, Butler. - Good evening, Aimo sir. Is everybody here? And Bruno? Is he still sober? You're the first to arrive. My master is in the hall. Look here, Butler. But that's... Surprised, huh, Butler? Bruno! Dammit, you scared me... Evening, Butler. It's so exciting here! Look, candles! Oh, how thrilling! This is madness. We shouldn't have come at all. Erik, it's just a game. Don't be such a spoilsport. What is it? It's Bruno! He always comes up with something horrible! I was scared stiff when I came here... And now, ladies and gentlemen... We can move on to the theme of the night. And that, as you'll recall, is crime! "The crime I've committed." Suspense should always build up. So we'll start modestly. Aimo, you're first. Then the ladies. Then me. And Erik. He promised to be the judge. Aimo, take your basket. That was a hard one to guess! Just a minute, Bruno. What is the worst crime possible? Murder. Obviously murder. Murder! What? Murder is the pivotal, the ultimate crime. One that can never be redeemed. That's why it's the only good topic for a detective novel. If you want to write one, mere forgery won't do. It must be murder! What? So you can take back those records. Many have spoilt their chances by hurrying too much. A policeman must be able to wait. Wait for the criminals to act and then solve the crime. And there's nothing romantic about it at all. You always talk about psychology and intuition, and like to show off with your academic studies. I'm just a simple old policeman. But I know that imagination has nothing to do with solving a crime. You need to collect the facts, arrange them and make the conclusions. That's it. But you have to be pedantic. So you need to rewrite this record. A bit of literary activity for you! Palmu. You know Bruno Rygseck? The man who guided traffic with horns on his head on May Day. Well, Bruno is no more. He got what he deserved. He slipped on a soap, hit his head and drowned in his bath. This morning, half an hour ago. Sic transit gloria mundi. - What? - It's Latin. Please. I have enough of a headache. An ordinary case, but it has a moral. A grotesque end to a grotesque life. Just think. Drowned in his bath! They had to break the door to get him. You'll do the interrogation. There's no one else available. Small accidents like these are your specialty. But be discreet. Don't harass the family. Hugo Rygseck is a powerful man. - Can we take a car? - Sure. Take a paddy wagon. Or the new armored car, in case someone attacks you on the way. But remember, no tricks! Hugo Rygseck is... It has to be murder! No one can drown in his bath. Bruno Rygseck didn't have a sober day in his adult life. For him such an end is natural. Who is... or was Bruno Rygseck? The worst rotten egg of Helsinki's aristocracy. He belonged in a sanitarium. But he owned a large share of the Rykämö corporation. Rykämö corporation? As far as I know, he never worked in his life and used his money on things it shouldn't be used on. You mean he had fun all his life. All right... The police. - Is the body still here? - Body? - Mr Rygseck was taken to hospital. - He isn't dead? There's reason to presume he can be brought to life. Why the police, then? Vaara and I wanted to ensure nothing was neglected. - Who is Vaara? - Vice director of Rykämö corporation. - Is he here? - In the hall. - What's your position here? - I'm Mr Rygseck's servant. My name is Veijonen, but he calls me "Butler". - Why? - I don't know. - It means "male servant". - I didn't ask you! In the hall we have Miss Rygseck, my master's aunt, and Mrs Rygseck, my master's wife. And Miss and Mr Rykämö, his cousins. Family gathering, huh? At last! Good day. I'm Inspector Palmu. I have to do an interrogation. Right. We're waiting for information from the hospital. Excuse me... Could we get that table? Could you tell me when everyone arrived, what happened then, and so on? Miss Amalia Rygseck said she arrived with Alli Rygseck. "Said"? I know exactly when I arrived. It's just a phrasing we use. She came with Alli Rygseck at 9.35 a.m., and told Butler to wake up his master, which he did. Both went to the hall to wait. Mrs Alli Rygseck confirms this. Engineer Erik Vaara arrived at 9.45 a.m. Hearing that Bruno was in the bath, he also went to the hall. Student Aimo Rykämö came at 10 a.m. or "a bit past". Or a bit fore... I mean... around 10 o'clock. Butler gave me a drink, so I just stayed here. Office clerk Airi Rykämö arrived at 10.20 a.m. She rang the doorbell many times. Vaara told her what had happened. The accident had already been noticed. At Miss Rygseck's insistence, Butler went upstairs at 10.15am. As Bruno hadn't come down, he went to the bathroom door. It was locked and he had no answer, so he became restless and asked Vaara to come with him. With Mr Rykämö they broke the door and found Mr Rygseck in the pool. Does anyone have anything to add? Why were you all here this morning? What's it to you? Private affairs, none of your concern. Excuse me. Hello? Speaking. He's dead. It can't be true. Bruno avoided the earthly judge, but he won't the divine one. Kokki, make sure the body is ready for autopsy. Butler, come with me! No one can leave without my permission. - Bathroom? - This way. Here. - Where do these stairs lead? - To the lounge. - And this corridor? - To the cellar rooms and outside. Get your fingers off! Who has been here after you found him? Everyone. It's very tidy. I cleaned after the ambulance left. Cleaned? Why? The floor was slippery. It could've caused another accident. - He slipped on a soap on the floor. - Soap? Yes, it left a long trace. - And naturally you threw the soap away? - Oh, no. It went flat but I squeezed it back to its original shape. I did it instinctively. Right, this is very simple. The knob goes here when it's open and there when it's locked. The bolt moves easily back and forth. Its weight makes it fall to the slot. Right? We have eyes on our heads, don't we? Now, just imagine... I lock the door so that I can take a bath in peace. Why do you want to take a bath? Did he lock the door when bathing? Not usually. He often needed my services. - I had to serve here as well. - Serve? Yes, you see... Hooray, drinks! Jump in the water! Really? Yes, and sometimes even... - Why was the door locked today? - I don't know. Tell me about your master's morning habits. He always woke up at 9.45am. - So punctually? - In this respect, yes. This is the last bond that connects me to organized society. Once it's severed, I'm ruined. The bath is ready, sir. After 20 minutes he rang from his room. I brought his breakfast. Did his friends know about these habits? Definitely. Now show me how you broke the door. It wasn't me. It was the engineer. All right. We came here. Vaara was first and I was last. We knocked on the door and listened. We tried the handle. Vaara tried to break it. Then he kicked it open. I stood here and turned the light on. Then we rushed in. And then? Tell me everything! Soap! He slipped on the soap! Over there. Lift the feet! - Let's turn him around. - Be quiet! Let's lift him so the water will flow out. And then? Vaara went to call the ambulance. Then I noticed it. Look! A bump. He has hit his head. Airi! Don't be silly! Airi! Be quiet! - He hit her? - Yes. - Then? - What's going on? He slipped on the soap... Vaara told them what had happened and the situation calmed down. Miss Rygseck told me to clean the soap before someone would slip. I did that after the ambulance took Bruno away. - Is that all? - Yes. Yes, Inspector. In that case it's clear. Again we see that a murderer always makes a mistake. It may be a minor thing but it's enough. Your testimony leaves me just one conclusion. But it was an accident. On the contrary. It was murder. But let it be for now. - The back door. - Who used this door? I never saw anyone use it. But I have reason to presume that a late guest may have used it. - A woman, for example? - For example. I also have reason to presume that to some trusted...guest my master may even have given the key. Very considerate. Were there many such...guests? That I cannot say. - You don't even presume? - No. - Here? - Cellar and boiler room. It's always locked. I forgot. Coal men were here this morning. - Coal men? - Yes, they delivered coal. - Crime is most influenced by... - Conditions at home! - A family member of mine... - A criminal? Who are you? What are you doing here? K. V. Laihonen, the writer. Why do you yell? Why are you here yourself? Mr Laihonen, what are you doing here? - Looking for my manuscript. - What? It's called "Castle in Spain". - Castle in Sp...? - Ain. The name is an allegory. It means something hat doesn't exist. It's everybody's dream. A wish about an imaginary land. Why did you look for it here? Well, I'm not looking for it right here. We had things to discuss and there was no other place. How long have you been here? Butler, what are they doing here? - You don't know what happened? - No. I'm Inspector Palmu, crime division. - Have you got something to hide? - No... - Mr Laihonen, why are you here? - The manuscript... Why are you here as in your home? Are you a friend of Mr Rygseck? I'm here for the first time. I've never met Mr Rygseck. - And Miss... - Miss Vanne, director Vanne's daughter. - Well, I was Bruno's friend. - You were? Until yesterday night. Not anymore. That's why we met here and what we talked about. - He has forgiven me. - Of course. So you two are old friends? Not at all. We met today for the first time. Or we met last Saturday, but I didn't know who she was. How long have you been here? My, it's almost noon! How time flies. We were to meet at 10, but he came too early. - My clock runs fast... - Well? I saw him talking to the coal men. When they left, we came in and have talked ever since. We had a most interesting discussion. So you're from the crime division? What a coincidence. We were just talking about crime. Who called the police? The crime was to be so perfect that the subject couldn't call them. The subject? He's at the morgue now! - Morgue? - That's right! Bruno Rygseck drowned in his bath while you were talking. Just think. Someone was murdered while we were here. It's like divine judgment. Murdered? I didn't say that. I said he drowned. As Miss Vanne knows, Mr Rygseck drank a lot last night. There's reason to presume he wasn't sober in the morning. He slipped on a soap, fell and drowned. Really? I need to know more about last night. - Who was here? - Everyone. The old Miss Rygseck only briefly, though. And Mr Laihonen wasn't here but his manuscript was. Old Miss Rygseck, Vaara, Miss and Mr Rykämö, Miss Vanne. - That's it? - Yes. The others are upstairs. Would you join them? Wait, you know where that door leads? Of course. To Bruno's bathroom and the lounge. Irma, come have a drink! Did you hear Bruno kicked the bucket? Can't you hurry up? The ladies are impatient. I'm just an old oaf, but since we are here, could you show us how you broke the door? Why? I'm not some comedian. No, that's how it's done. It's what they call an alibi. Bruno! Bruno! Open the door! Out of the way. Something in Butler's story caught my attention. Something very strange. Why was the light on in the bathroom? Of course it was. Bruno wouldn't bathe in the dark. Butler turned the switch, but still the light was on. That's the thing. Turn the switch, the light turns on. - He did it instinctively. Right? - I didn't see him do that. He did do it. I remember it clearly. Don't be silly! You can't remember it. I saw it! Of course I remember it. Did you turn it? Think carefully. Yes, Inspector. Out of habit. You can't remember it. Don't you see it means trouble for us all? Including you. I can swear I turned the switch. Very well. We'll see whose testimony is more credible. I know a thing or two about your past. Listen... I'm completely batty. I don't understand a thing! What are you loitering here for? I have no time to wait. I have things to do. Even you, old man! - Butler, the grave isn't ready yet. - Grave? - Guests? - Miss Vanne. You were here last night. - Who is that man? - Mr Laihonen, a writer. Mr Laihonen... I read one of your books. That's nice. After reading it, I burned it! What a little creep... What are you looking for here? Right now a 30-inch string. That man is crazy! Also, why are there so many people here? What business did you have with Bruno, Vaara? I'll tell you. I came to beat him up, sock his eye and break his chin. Enough? Engineer Vaara, you're a man of honour. You came here at 9.45. What did you do then? I went straight upstairs. Bruno wasn't in his room. I came back to wait in the hall. - How long were you there? - About 10 minutes. So long? - Now, could I ask... - I'll also be frank. We were discussing getting Bruno to a sanitarium. Did you hear anyone walking while Vaara was gone? No, I didn't. The door was closed and we talked intensely. Why do you ask? - I really need to go now. - Wait a minute. You don't have a string this long in your pocket? - You'll answer for this! - You'll tell your superior, right? Erik? Aimo, what happened? Erik is completely batty and I don't understand a thing. Airi! Be careful with your words. They have no right to pester you. - What's this about? - The light switch. I saw Butler turn it. Erik says he didn't, but he did. What's this about a light switch? Could I ask you to go upstairs? You came with Miss Rygseck and sat here till Bruno was found dead. Yes. You talked about getting your husband to an asylum. - I already told you! - Excuse me. Yes. Vaara peeked in at 9.45 and left for 10 minutes. Both of you were here during that time. - I told you that! - Be quiet! That's right. Did you hear anything? No. The door was closed and we talked all the time. Did you notice anything peculiar about Vaara? Well, he seemed nervous. He drummed the window with his fingers. You were separated, but the divorce wasn't legal yet? Yes. I was warned but had to pay the price. - Did you have children? - No. - You're the only heir? - No. We had a prenup. My father's wish was that shares wouldn't go outside the family. But she has made sure not to end up penniless. Will you come with me, Alli? - I have to go now, Inspector. - That's fine. I have no reason to bother you. For now. Thank you. Good bye. I'll be back this afternoon. I hope the house is empty then. Hey boys, let's have a drink! First I'll check what Butler is doing outside. - Sure. No hurry. - Be as sober as you can. Excuse me. About the manuscript... Dear Lord, strike me down should he bother me once more! Someone else would be happy to sit there and talk. Inspector... You haven't seen or heard anything. The day was terrible and you're shocked. Right? How did you know? That's the closet! Inspector... A rag. What are you doing, Butler? Can't you see? I'm digging a grave. Is this the place where... Princess Adeline will be buried here. - Princess? - Von Katzendorf-Copperg. Old Miss Rygseck was fond of her. How did she die? I have reason to presume she got poison in her cream. - Why do you presume? - I brought the cream. Why the poison? I have to pull each word with a corkscrew! Corkscrew? Very well. But keep in mind that I'm only a servant. My observations are random. I'm only there when needed. Well, I'll try to keep that in mind. I'm used to strange things in this house. But last night was one of the strangest. Before the guests arrived my master gave me a shock. He was disguised. - As what? - As Death. Young Mr Rykämö was the first to arrive. He brought Princess Adeline. I have reason to presume he had stolen it. Then came Miss Vanne. "Castle in Spain" I have reason to presume she had also stolen it. Come now. Director Vanne's daughter? - Do you want me to continue? - Excuse me. At first everyone had fun. They drank a lot. But before 11 p.m. something happened. And now, ladies and gentlemen... The buffet is just below the stairs. They're wooden and a little rickety. So you notice people running up and down. - Erik! - Hey, wait! - Butler! - Yes, sir? - Bring cream on a plate! - Cream? For the cat! You think I'd drink it? He went upstairs. I was soon to find out why. Very good, Butler! Tomorrow you'll pay for this and everything else. Butler, bury the Princess in the garden. There's not much more to tell. My master told Aimo that Amalia wouldn't dare to do anything. Miss Vanne was the last to leave after arguing with my master. Why did Amalia want the cat to be buried here? I think she had a feeling she would move here soon. Why? Some of the family planned to put master in a sanitarium. You know as well as I that it was murder. Before you turned the switch the bathroom was dark. The door was locked from the inside. You know how it can be done. You go to the bathroom, knock your master dead, push him to the pool, make a trail with the soap, and lock the door from outside. - You know how to do it. - Yes. - Once at the hotel... - Hotel? - I used to work in a hotel. - I see. With a string this long you can easily lock the door. It's an old trick. After that the murderer turned the light switch, instinctively. - Right? - Yes, out of a habit. Like you did when you entered the bathroom. You washed the floor and got rid of the clues. Why would I stick to my testimony about the switch? - Only it points to murder. - Why do you stick to it? You'd find out eventually, so I'll tell you. - I was fired from the hotel. - Why? - Because of a cash deficit. - And then? That's all. You haven't told me why you stick to the testimony. A child could see you know more than you tell. And that's your intention. I warn you. Don't play with evil powers! When you're ready, come with us upstairs. The only servants are the cook and you? - Master drove the car by himself. - Yes, I've read about it in the papers. Stairs to the bathroom. Mrs Rygseck's bedroom. It's a guestroom now. Bathroom of upstairs. And here's Mr Rygseck's sanctuary. Study and bedroom. You stay here. - Inspector! - What? Seems that Bruno took photos in his bed. Yes, and painted too. Butler! - What is this tune? - "Rise Up My Soul". - Why is it playing? - By coincidence. I wound it this morning when master went to bath. - Was the camera here then? - No, it was standing. You were here later. Didn't you notice it? I was only at this door. - Did you open the drawer? - No. Was this here? And the string? String... I think so. The red book. - Mr Rygseck's red book. - What is it? I don't know. I often heard people talk of it. Many were eager to see it but only a few could. I wasn't allowed to see it. - No presumptions about its content? - No. Right... - Here's the manuscript. - I'm so grateful. - Could I have the string? - Of course. Some dunce has tied it. The string damages the margins. I... I tied it. - I wouldn't have done it if I'd known. - Oh, but it's a trifle! - Where did you get the string? - From a candybag. - I like candies. - So do I. - Really? - Especially hard ones with soft filling. Kiss Kiss candies. Everybody to the hall! Butler too. I have to leave now. I've missed my work all morning. First tell me why you came here this morning. I forgot my powder last night. I came to get it... Don't be batty, Airi. - Everyone knows you came to... - Aimo! How about you? Why are you here? Me? I came for drink. I had a hangover. I thought Bruno would need one anyway when he wakes up. - So when he takes some absinthe... - Absinthe? - Yeah, he drank it with his wife. - Some poisons! Oh yes, it's awful. I wanted brandy... Right, you came for a drink. By the way, who has the key to the back door? I do. Inspector, you're asked to the phone. Boys, come here! Close the doors! So boys, do you know what we'll do now? We'll go home. Drop the investigations and go home. We've no right to bother decent people. And why? "There's no evidence it wasn't an accident." So says Hagerth. I tried to tell him about the switch. He told me to go to hell! - Must be his nerves. - Must be his hangover! But what to do? Director Rygseck called his friend the minister. And he called the governor who called the chief of police. He scolded Hagerth who scolded me. And now I scold you so that it's all done in order! - Or what? - Yes. Damn those Rygsecks and Rykämös... Everyone is free to go. I said right off the bat that the whole thing was batty. Who cares about some light switch? Here's the key. Is the investigation cancelled? Yes, if you hurry you still have time to crawl to Canassa. Canossa. Inspector Palmu... This case is interesting. Could we get a cup of coffee? - It's already past breakfast. - But it's lunchtime! Could I ask you to join us? It would be pleasant. We are happy to accept your invitation. I know. Let's go to Hotel Kämp. Our car is waiting. - Welcome. - Thank you. Inspector, the paint had been scoured off on two spots. On the lock of bathroom, that is... like it'd been rubbed with a string. You couldn't see it with bare eyes, but with a magnifying glass... You always carry one around in your pocket? To all Mondays! Life is sweet. Even a minor nuisance can break a lifelong principle. This is the first time I've drunk alcohol while working. True story! I've also left a manuscript to a publisher... A propos, it would be fun to know how Miss Vanne got the script. It's a long story that you wouldn't care to hear. Well, I would! - You've heard about treasure hunt? - What? I ordered a pianist. Some quiet music won't bother? On the contrary, music is inspiring! Right, Miss Vanne? Kokki, knock it off. Right, treasure hunt is a crazy game from America. Everyone has to get, say, ten objects in a given time. They are more or less difficult to get. Horse's tail hair, policeman's baton, actress's shoe, etc. - The one who brings the most wins. - Come on! Yes, I've heard of it, too! It all started when we met Bruno last Thursday. Ville, hi there! How's it going? Aimo had some finances to talk over with him. I think Bruno just wanted to tease Vaara who didn't really fit in. I had read about treasure hunt and thought it would be fun. But Bruno wasn't satisfied. No, no! Everyone has to commit a crime. A crime that the victim cannot report. Out of fear or other reason. It must be something irreplaceable. - This is going to be good... - I don't get it. Well, if you steal Aunt Amalia's cat, it's irreplaceable to her. But she wouldn't go to the police. They'd think she was crazy! Or... There's Laihonen, the writer. If he'd lose his manuscript, he'd be too absentminded to rewrite it. Well, I'm not that absentminded... But it wouldn't come out the same way. Anyway, Vaara objected to the plan. It's the craziest idea I've ever heard! You and Airi just don't dare. She always does what you say. - In this case she will. - I'll do what I want! Don't be batty, Erik! - I'll take part on one condition. - Well? If I win, you'll go to a sanitarium for two years. Vaara withdrew eventually but agreed to take part as a judge. I think he came to look after Airi. We agreed to meet at Bruno's home on Sunday at 9 p.m. I agree with Vaara. It's a mad idea. A play with evil powers of the soul. When you think of crime, you unleash what's normally kept hidden. A criminal must have an alibi... And now we come to the manuscript. It's so silly. Don't laugh at me. I took Bruno's idea because I'd wanted to meet Mr Laihonen. I have to go now. He had never noticed we lived on the same street. Almost opposite to each other. Is Mrs Laihonen home? No, she's gone to the country. She'll be back next week. Right, thank you. I made sure his mother wasn't home, though I had already guessed it. - Guessed? - Yes. Because he was at an outdoor restaurant. He's so kind and his mother tyrannizes him so much. She forces him to wear galoshes and forbids him to go to restaurants. No, not really... - I forgot my galoshes! - What did I tell you? On Thursday and Friday he worked until late. He only went to a nearby cafe at 9 p.m. On Saturday night... Miss? Hello, Miss? - Water! - Just a minute... Dammit! You don't understand how clever my crime was. He couldn't go to the police. His mother would know he had a young woman at home late at night. I knew the culprit had been the beautiful stranger, but I didn't know what to do about it. I'm curious to know how you wound up in the coal cellar. Don't be an idiot, Bruno! Give it to me! No, I won't! - Excuse me... - What? - Who lives here? - Say what? Oh, you're here. You're here already? - I came too early. - I have to explain everything. Let's go to the cellar so we can talk. Why a letter? Wouldn't a call have been better? Yes, I didn't think of that. I cling to details, it's a bad habit of mine. Could we move on to last night? Well Aimo, how was your crime? When Aunt Amalia went to the sewing society this morning, I sent a kid to get the cat and told Aunt had asked for it. Sending the kid was a clever touch. - Irma! - Silence! I was laying on the chair and he was getting me water, so I took it. - Well, a little bit better. - It was brilliant! Just an ordinary theft. But look at this! Ten bills from Aimo that Bruno has agreed to pay. How did you get them? What was the crime? - We can't tell that. - It's a secret. I can tell you it was blackmail. A kind of blackmail. Not fair. What's the point if you don't tell us? I'd say it was a crime of indecency. - What? - Or what do you think, Airi? Airi used my weakness for indecency to get hold of that paper. It will cost me a tidy sum of money. Aimo's gambling debts. Right, Airi's crime was a damn good crime. But my crime is so horrible that I can only reveal it to the judge. Erik, come upstairs and choose the winner. - Maybe Bruno has a corpse in there. - Aimo! Shush! Bruno won. But I'll make sure he won't boast for long. And we already heard about the poisoning of the cat. What did Bruno show to Vaara? You don't know. And my guess is that Vaara won't tell. Anyway, the crime needn't have anything to do with last night. Though it is strange that everyone was there this morning. - And Mrs Rygseck... - Yes, she profited quite a lot. I mean, more than if they hadn't been separated. And then there's Butler. I could swear he lied to me about one thing. By the way, Miss Vanne... Why did you socialize with Bruno? You knew he was morally depraved. You mean seeing as I come from a "good family"? Good people tend to be boring. Bruno Rygseck was not. And there's more than one kind of moral depravity. I only ask because I want to think all the best of you. Anyway, we didn't come here just to talk! Eyes as dark as darkest nights of the fall for a moment won't give me peace. I may travel to the end of the world, yet they haunt me without cease. Full of tears they gave me once a painful gaze. I'll see it till the end of my poor days. Eyes as dark as darkest nights of the fall will not leave my soul alone! Palmu, where have you been? The whole station is upside down because of you. - At Kämp, for lunch. - On working hours! And drunk as a skunk! - Did you have a car? - No. Or yes, but we left it in front of the hotel. Now you'll go back to Bruno Rygseck at once! But he's dead. Died in an accident this morning. This is no time for jokes. Vaara called us half an hour ago. The divorced Mrs Rygseck has taken poison and died. Maybe we shouldn't have dropped the investigation. "We"? Well, let's go, boys! Kokki! You're not driving! Right. Hey, come with us. There's a little task for you. Inspector, I owe you an apology. - There was another terrible accident. - Accident? - Where's the body? - Upstairs. We carried her to her former room. I'm sorry I was the one demanding to drop the investigation, thus causing this other accident. I'll take one thing at a time. Inspector Palmu, Dr. Dahlberg. Asphyxiation in a blink of an eye. The poison burned the throat and mucosas. - Hydrocyanic acid? - Probably potassium cyanide. It produces hydrocyanic acid when it comes in touch with gastric acid. Have you smoked here? I never smoke while I'm working. Has anyone else smoked after the body was brought here? No. The door was locked and the room has not been used. Come with me! We came to discuss actions resulting from Bruno's death. I came to represent director Rygseck. He's crippled, as you may know. So there were Miss Rygseck, whom I asked to take over the house. I already took hold of the silver. Miss and Mr Rykämö and Mrs Rygseck. We had to invite her too, because the divorce wasn't legal yet. An awkward situation came up right away. Mrs Rygseck wanted to have the house, although she had no right to it according to the prenup. What did she inherit? A large amount of cash and a pension from the corporation till her death. And if she had divorced? Only the pension, which would have stopped if she had remarried. So her husband's death came at a very convenient moment. If she were still alive, that is. She didn't have a right to the house, anyway. Who are the heirs? Director Rygseck and the present family. You served the drinks, Butler? Tell me how it happened. In the wrong order. I should have served Miss Rygseck first. But she told me to start with Mrs Rygseck. Not true! I didn't tell you to serve her poison! Nobody knew it was poison! It went like this: Mrs Rygseck sat here. - Absinthe, Aunt Amalia? - Aimo! I'll have Madeira. I'll have absinthe. I haven't had it in a long time. I'll bring you a bigger glass then. No need. I'll have it dry. - And Miss? - Madeira, but serve her first. I couldn't drink that. Tastes like anise, right? No, this tastes like...almond? When we lifted her up there was a distinct scent of almond. - Potassium cyanide. - But we can't find the jar. It was almost full. Where did Bruno get the poison and what kind of a jar was it? And where was it left yesterday? Anyone seen it? An ordinary chemistry jar with a picture of a skull, and no one has seen it? Everyone thinks it was left in the hall. Except Butler, who thinks Bruno took it with him. Correction: presumes. Right, we need to find it. Body to the morgue! Absinthe bottle to analysis! Also, it'd be good if I could find the weapon used to knock Bruno out before he was pushed to the pool. You still stick to your theory that Bruno was murdered? You think her death was a mistake and the poison meant for Bruno? - It's clear. - Bruno drowned in the bath. Butler is now ready to correct his error with the switch. It's true. I didn't turn the light switch. What's this chatter about the light switch? They're batty! I believe many people had reason to want Bruno dead. But who benefited from his wife's death? For now, everyone who was here this morning is a suspect. I'll call the murder squad to take your fingerprints. No one will leave this room without my permission. But Inspector, you have no right... What a batty guy! Inspector, I'm in a bit of hurry. What are you waiting for? Butler, throw the man his coat! - I'm ready to answer any questions. - Thank you and goodbye. Goodbye! Butler, who spent the night in the guest room? So, you noticed it too. I've been trying to figure it out but don't know who it could be. - I swear all the guests left. - Who was the last guest? Miss Vanne. She wrote a letter before she left. You may go. Hello, Palmu here. Listen... If you want I can give you the pattern for the whole case. Let's assume first that there's one murderer, X. This X doesn't like Bruno. So he mixes potassium cyanide with absinthe, so that Bruno would take it for his hangover and drop dead. But for some reason he discards the bottle and knocks him dead instead. Maybe he was in a hurry and had to get rid of the absinthe... Wait! There could also be two murderers. X and, let's say, Y. X plans to knock him out and Y mixes the poison. But X is faster. Or then Y was planning to poison the missus. Maybe Y didn't plan to poison the missus but someone else altogether, say Z. Or maybe X was after Z as well, but neither one made it. - You're drunk! - Not at all. Stop! Don't get your fingerprints all over it! How could you know it was there? I peeked in. Out of curiosity. Let's start with Bruno's murder. Kokki, call Miss Rykämö! Tell me the truth about your brother's debts. Don't be afraid. We won't get him in any trouble. Aimo is so childish and easily influenced by others. But he's a good boy. Even in his childhood... And Bruno lent him money and paid his bills. Now I realize he did it to get me under his control. Aimo has forged my name in cold blood on over 10 bills. They're worth 120,000 marks. My God! I might let it pass if you come to discuss it at my place. - I should come? - Yes, tomorrow night. At 11. It's not a matter of money. You have time till tomorrow night. Or I'll be forced to send Aimo to prison. Of course, no one has to see you coming. The key to the back door. What is it? What, what, what? Not a trace of good manners! Kokki, take them to the bathroom and tell them what to do. And don't be as noisy as gypsies! So, you went? I had no other option. I went. And when I left Bruno gave me this. - It should be legal. - Certainly. Why did he give you this? No one shall ever know. We swore it to each other. - You committed a crime. - You know about the game? Maybe it was blackmail, but he was a blackmailer too. Bruno said it was a crime of indecency. So, Irma Vanne has been gossiping. You may think what you want, but I won't break my vow. Do you know what Bruno showed to Vaara? No, and I don't care! He can think what he wants of me. I'm happy my eyes are open now. He thinks so too, that's why he came here. And you came after him because you were afraid... - Not true! - You were afraid that Vaara would... Not true! Erik is not a murderer! You have no reason to bother Miss Rykämö! What is this? Vaara, you have no right to meddle in my affairs. You may go to hall to wait. You too, miss. Turn around! Everyone! This needs to be photographed. Take Mrs Rygseck's fingerprints at the morgue. Thank you. Engineer Vaara. What did Bruno show you in his room? None of your business. Have you ever seen Bruno's red book? I've heard of it but it has nothing to do with this. No? I thought you loved Miss Rykämö. You're insane, man! Do I have to put you in cuffs? Sure, I wrote Bruno's name in the bills when I couldn't get hold of him. But it's not forgery if I just write it... Sure, Bruno showed me the red book. The one with the girlies. Bruno liked taking photos. He was really... Right, I think we're done. You may go. I'm sorry, Miss Rygseck, that you needed to wait so long. - I'm used to it. - But I had a reason. You're a judicious woman. That's why I'm asking you to help us. I'll be glad to help you if you tell me two things. Do you have reason to believe my nephew was murdered? Yes. Do you think someone tried to poison me today? It occurred to me too, but I don't think so. I'm ready to help you. Who do you think benefited from Mrs Rygseck's death? Benefited? You mean who will inherit her? No doubt her mother, who is still alive. She'll get the money Alli inherited from Bruno. Did the same person who mixed the poison kill your nephew? Could you make that clearer? Why did Bruno die before he could meet anyone who came to see him? You mean the murderer needed to hurry? After mixing the poison, he had no time to wait for the absinthe. In that case he needed to know who was waiting for Bruno. Exactly. When are you going to capture him? - Whom? - Butler, of course. You're a smart woman but for now we need to keep this a secret. Thank you for your help. I'll go and get my things here now. - I'll keep an eye on him. - Fine. You'll get a new hostess, Butler. Miss Rygseck went to get her things. By the way, do you have any reason to presume that someone would think you drink your master's absinthe? Your own fault, Butler. Why didn't you tell us everything? What did you mean by that? Well, I just warned him. And sometimes talking nonsense can get you results. Have you forgotten about the coal men? What about them? I don't need them. They were here at the time of murder. Given Bruno's lifestyle, it's possible he was rude with a working-class girl. The girl's brother, a coal man, came to get even with Bruno. He used the opportunity to avenge his sister. - Do you read a lot of weeklies? - I don't think... The murderer was uncovered a long time ago. The first mistake revealed it was murder. The second one revealed the murderer. The second one? Mrs Rygseck's death was the second mistake. You mean you still don't know who's the murderer? Well, it's not your fault you have a slim head and broad shoulders. But your notes are very tidy, I'll give you that. I forgot to give this to Kokki. There are some nice fingerprints inside. I like to take them from people who lie to me. I think I'll go to the sauna. You can write the report. Palmu. Yes. What time? I'll come. Goodbye. Director Rygseck rang and asked to come for a visit at 10.30 p.m. Director Rygseck? Come! We can't keep the big shots waiting. I don't wish to interfere, just to point out a few things. You've no doubt noticed my nephew Bruno was an unpredictable person. Maybe you think he was downright insane. But he was not. I'm convinced of it. I knew him well and I'd never put him into an asylum. My sister Amalia thought he was insane and needed to be under custody. Only few people knew how vulnerable Bruno was. And how inclined to depression. I knew this side of him. As said, I was very close to him. I know the idea of suicide often got hold of him. Let me continue! Bruno was afraid of Amalia and her attempts to get him to a sanitarium. He understood the threat and knew he went too far this time. At night his weary brains thought up suicide as the only solution. He got up and mixed poison to absinthe, his favorite drink. But... He was a coward and couldn't do it. So it wasn't a coincidence that he slipped on the soap and hit his head. It was all caused by his death wish. It would be honor to your wits to accept my theory. You didn't refer to the family burden just now. No, I didn't think it was necessary. Yet it's known that your father died insane. I assumed you would ignore such nonsense. Slander, gossip. The firm is a family business. Who has the highest authority? My sister has 1/4 of the shares. I have almost half. Bruno had 1/4. Aimo and Airi have a few shares. And after Bruno Rygseck's death you own more than half. Simple arithmetics! But I haven't heard your opinion yet. Murder is always murder. I demand proof! I won't have taxpayers' money wasted on useless investigations! I hope you understand what I mean. We already have two corpses. Who will be the third? You're a stubborn man, Inspector Palmu. Well then, we won't talk about this anymore. We can move on to the main topic. We've been planning to standardize our guarding. We need to find the right person to carry it out. Inspector Palmu, we might offer the position to you. I hope you'll consider my offer. Maybe you can dictate it to your secretary. Otherwise it would expire if you'd suddenly die. Your remark is correct, Inspector. I'm planning to travel south for holiday with my sister Amalia. But your needn't fear. It won't affect our plans. My car is available for you. No, I haven't enlisted as a night guard yet. Well, we need to clarify ourselves too. Yesterday morning you were at Bruno's study. You took a key from his pocket and opened the drawer. What were you looking for? His book of memories. And you found it. You tore a page and returned downstairs to the women. Aimo Rykämö joined you soon, having just committed a most cunning murder. Aimo? When he realized Bruno had desecrated his sister because of his forgeries, he made his decision. But the tragedy is that both you and Aimo were mistaken. Bruno didn't touch Airi Rykämö. For shame! Love demands trust. But it wasn't a mistake. I saw it myself. You didn't see a thing! You know she visited Bruno, that's it. You deserve to lose her love. - But I did see it! - Well, let me see the photo, too. Skillfully made. If I had a magnifying glass... Here's one. Thank you. Yes, it's clear... Here's the junction. The head belongs to Miss Rykämö. The body, who knows? That's all you saw. You were ready to believe anything about your bride. For shame! It served you right to lose her love. But that's not all. By believing it you also made Aimo believe it. You were about to beat Bruno up. Aimo went further. He killed the man who desecrated his sister. Such a shame for the family! And the corporation! The world shall see Aimo and Airi Rykämö only as Bruno's heirs. Now I have to arrest both because she knows about the crime. Inspector. It wasn't Aimo. I killed Bruno Rygseck. I'm forced to arrest you. I would like to see Airi first. Miss Rykämö, would you come here? Miss Rykämö, I need to show you a photo that Bruno showed to Vaara. But...this isn't me. - Vaara believes it is. - Airi... So that's why Bruno told me not to tell anyone! And Erik, you believed? You believed I have such an ugly body? Miss Rykämö, Vaara just confessed killing Bruno. Erik, I was afraid of that. Afraid? - But he said that Aimo... - What about Aimo? - Aimo killed Bruno. - Aimo? Killed? Do you think Aimo could kill anyone! You wrinkled old fungus! - You lied to me. - But you confessed! Well, I didn't believe you, anyway. I appreciate your nobility. And I believe Miss Rykämö does too. - Excuse me, can I use the phone? - Of course. - Would you like a cigar? - Thanks. Almost as good as the ones upstairs! Could I speak with servant Veijonen? Thank you. Butler has disappeared. - He left yesterday evening. - Who answered the phone? Miss Amalia Rygseck. We need to go now. Thank you and goodbye. I've been working at home. Miss Vanne has helped me. - I'm not bothering? - Not at all. I'm making coffee. Why did you lie to me, Miss Vanne? You spent the night in Bruno's guest room. Answer me! I didn't want Mr Laihonen to get the wrong impression. When Bruno refused to give the manuscript, I decided to spend the night there and grab it while he was taking a bath. I woke up early and smoked a few cigarettes. Master Bruno! It's Butler. You may not believe me but I heard noises. It was Vaara smashing Bruno's camera. - Was it he who... - No, no. Please continue. I was afraid Mr Laihonen was waiting for me already. So I rushed downstairs without anyone seeing me. Wait a minute. What was that sound? I can't say. Try to remember. You passed the bathroom at the time of murder. I thought the stairs creaked. I looked around but saw nothing. - You didn't see anything else? - No. You must have! I didn't see or hear anything else. Don't you believe me? You already lied once. You're hiding something. - It's better that you... - I don't know anything! Not even if you kill me. Why don't you believe me? I believe you, Irma. I must order you to stay home and not leave without my permission. - This is an order! - But it's... Well, you can stay with her. - Inspector... - Don't bother me! - Listen, Toivo. - Goddammit, Kokki! Have someone watch Miss Vanne's place. She's in house arrest. And you! Take this bedroom key to Amalia Rygseck. And bring me the red book. But don't look at it! And tell her, and don't forget this, that we're on the trail of the murderer. And Miss Vanne knows something of it because she spent the night there. Tell the same things to Aimo and Airi Rykämö and Vaara. And show the red book to Miss Vanne. - But why? - Just do as I said! And remember: see everyone in person. Right. Have you done anything to find Butler? The Inspector will take care of it. No need to worry, Miss Rygseck. I have a feeling that he's sneaking around the house. When I was on the town I had the feeling I was being followed. He may have a key to the house. I'm still spending the night here. Did you know Miss Vanne spent the night here when Bruno was killed? Palmu believes she knows quite a lot about the murder. You could guess it about that hussy. Even if she's a director's daughter. Painted lips and eyes... By the way, what have you been painting? Come and see. I'll show you. You didn't know I used to paint when I was young? Now it's suitable to hang on the wall. The old version was indecent. Well, it's getting dark. Frankly, I'm a little bit scared. - I wish I had a gun. - I can lend you one. How nice of you. Really? But how do you use it? Here's the safety. And then you just pull the trigger. I'm so sorry... Give it back to me. Accidents might happen. If there's going to be shooting here, I'm off. You'll leave when the bathroom door is fixed. Is that clear? You have to be really careful with the gun. Even exaggerated self-defence is a crime. - Miss Vanne? - Yes. - It's Miss Rygseck, hello. - Hello. I was thinking, maybe you could help me a bit? I can't think of anyone else. Help me solve these unfortunate events. Maybe you don't know it, but Butler has escaped. I'd like to investigate it and thought you might come over. We could investigate together. - Well? - Well what? - Well? - Mission accomplished. - You met everyone? - Yes. Mr Laihonen was looking after Irma Vanne. Miss Rygseck will spend the night in the house. She thinks she has been followed. She has been. I don't want any more corpses. - What are we waiting for? - For the murderer's move. The web is getting tighter. I can't understand what's taking so long. Could I speak to Miss Vanne? She's asleep? Wake her up then! - She was already asleep then. - Wait a minute! What? She was asleep when I paid a visit. So you didn't meet her? Where is Miss Vanne? Don't stutter, man! Where did she go? When? An hour ago! You come with us! Miss Rygseck, I checked his room but didn't find... Miss Rygseck? There you are! I've been looking for you. Come! - The old woman is inside. - How about Miss Vanne? Yes. She came half an hour ago. - And you let her go in? - Well, you didn't forbid it. Quick! You go to the front door. Butler, give him the key! You go first. The light can't be switched on. Come back! Miss Vanne! Open the door. It's Palmu. It's all over. Open the door! Well! Hello there! Brandy? Don't worry, I've tried it myself. We'll go now, Amalia. - You must be tired. - I'm very tired, Gunnar. You're a nice boy. I'm sorry the pistol went off accidentally. I'm going abroad now. Isn't it right, Gunnar? - Let's go now! - Why are you so nervous? Pay me a visit in my office. I can't understand why you had to run in front of me. An old oaf like me would have deserved... He's a hero. I still don't understand where she got the gun. From me. Since it's going to be a long story, couldn't we go through it in Hotel Kämp? - My treat, of course. - Great idea! Well, I wasn't expecting something like this! Congratulations! Inspector Palmu, why did Miss Rygseck kill her nephew? Surely not because of the cat? The cat meant more to her than we can imagine. In a way, she had shaped the cat as her own image. Wouldn't you agree as a writer? Yes, it can be true. It's a profound thought. Bruno was the only one who knew Amalia's secret: insanity. Killing the cat was a declaration of war. Bruno killed something in her. I understand. How about Mrs Rygseck's death? She lied when she said they sat in the hall at the time of murder. She knew Amalia killed Bruno but wanted to blackmail her. So she gave her an alibi. That's why she wanted the house. And thus signed her death sentence. Right. But how about the murder weapon? The one used to knock Bruno cold? Why, we've seen it many times by now. Kokki! Amalia Rygseck's umbrella. Subtitles by Veikko for KG
