I've learnt a lot on this journey, I'm still ignorant... Amazed, compelled, loved... Overrated, censored... Satisfied... Empty... Starved... Free... But a slave to all this. Grateful, and proud of everything we've achieved. A friend, and an enemy. Embraced by so many, yet alone. Silently screaming... I'm still here, but I'm already somewhere else. Wishing I could stop... Scared of it all ending. I want to scream into the depths of my soul. Loud like the silence. Our truth is just as important as yours is. I want to scream. Don't lose the thread that binds us! And they talk for me… I was 17 when we started Berri Txarrak. Everything is pure at that age. Noise is the easiest way of railing against the world. At 40, you're still the same person, but you're not necessarily the same. Now, at this precise moment when satisfaction meets exhaustion, I can say it’s been incredible to have experienced every minute of this group's story. I also think it's time to hit the pause button. An indefinite halt, a change of course. After it was announced publicly, the 25,000 tickets for our final gigs sold out immediately. Crazy. Before we stop, we’ll do one final world tour. We've got nine hectic months ahead. Eh… Gorka, let's try your voice. Ok, a bit louder. Good, that's fine. David, let's hear your voice. Our first European gig was in Germany. That experience was crucial to us quitting our jobs. If we wanted to make it internationally, we had to give it our all. Sure, we already lived for music, but making a living from music? I was born for this, and it'll be the death of me. - Hi! - Hi! Are you here for Berri Txarrak too? Yeah, but we don’t know if it's this door. - Where are you from? - Germany, I live near Frankfurt. - Do you always go to the gigs alone? - Yeah, usually. It's rare that I can convince someone to go with me. Are you going to the other gigs? You're following the tour? Yes. If they're in Germany, sure. At one concert in France there was some problem with the advertising and only one person went. But they played for that person. Yeah, it was on TV. Just one person and they did the gig. Here it is... They play for one person in France. I don't know. How does 'Infra' end? - 'Denak'? - Wouldn't it be better to start with 'Infra'? Yeah? Yeah, you finish 'Jaio' and ''oh yeah!''. I say something, and 'Denak'. And then... No, after 'Jaio'. - After 'Jaio'. - After 'Jaio', to finish the set? It'll be a really great moment. And then at the end... 'Oihu', and then 'Min Hau' and 'Ikusi Arte'. Shit, there's nothing from Haria or from Payola. What time is it? Late! I need to change and go through the rigmarole. I need a tonne of imagination. To keep calling anything a revolution. I'm really worried, and yes, I'm the exception. So much that I believe that I can change something. On my side: just six strings. Enough courage to ask myself questions. Against us: a sterile inertia that engulfs everything. The years are long in the century of turtles… So much literature to explain that probably. More than all the watches in the world. This time that’s slipping away is worth a thousand times more. Since that first tour, we’ve returned countless times. It's not massive, but I think we've left our small mark on this country. I remember the venues we've returned to time and again: Sonic Ballroom, Cologne; Hafenklang, Hamburg; Alte Hackerei, Karlsruhe; the Au squat in Frankfurt; and of course, Clash in Berlin. When people sing your songs, wherever the gig is, it moves you deep inside. That's when you realise: ''This is why I’m still doing this''. Have you ever made a list of all the concerts you've been to? No, maybe I should. But it's almost impossible now. - A hundred? - No idea, I couldn't say. I started going to gigs when Berri Txarrak went on tour. There were loads of gigs back to back. At gigs, I let myself get carried away. I love being with everyone else. Talking to them, getting swept along, the music, the group... It's an amazing feeling, I can't describe it. The same fire that burned you lit the way. The basic law of walking, falling and getting back up. The same fire that burned you lit the way. The basic law of walking, falling and getting back up. Dear Gorka, I'm writing to ask you a favour. When I started to transition, I decided to get a tattoo that says ''ikasitakoa desikasten ikasi''. I'd like to use your lyrics, if I can. It'd be really special. We've already had our final gigs in Berlin, in Paris, in Gernika... Little by little you see the consequences of this difficult decision. From the dressing room, you hear cries of ''Encore! Encore!''. Then, you ask yourself… Are you really going to leave all this behind? Prioritising was never easy. Managing a group is making thousands of small decisions. Instinct has always guided the way there. Even when you've felt over-exposed. On one hand, you've got the best thing music can give you: people listen to what you say, or to your music. On the other hand, this means learning while everyone watches. Now my instinct is telling me that to keep exploring as an artist, it's time to leave ''home''. It's hard, but you can't ignore a calling like this. When someone becomes the battlefield. What is victory? What is defeat? I don't expect to come out of this OK. But just to feel alive. But just to feel alive. - Mum. - Yes, sweetheart. In the song 'Min Hau', why does it say that they can’t find the wound anywhere? What does that mean? Hmm... what does that mean... It means that... ...they feel pain inside, and that they're not wounded. Something can happen that hurts you but doesn't leave a wound. Like... I don't know... If someone behaves badly it can hurt you. - Like disrespects you? - For example. Or... ...when someone you love... dies. Or... when they're far from home, and you can't be with someone... There could be loads of things inside us that hurt us, - but don't leave a wound. - But don't leave a wound. Sometimes, this pain is much more painful than a wound. Inner pain. OK, great. Straighten your arm. Turn your wrist slightly. I've got no idea what this means. I prepared the tattoo and forgot to ask you what it means. It's a line from a song by Berri Txarrak, As I said, I'm transitioning. It means, ''learn to unlearn what you've learnt''. I'm unlearning everything that I learnt years back. For me, this transition symbolises not a new stage but a new life. The life I always wanted, but that it’s been hard to get. - Great. It's ready. - Perfect. When is your first appointment with the doctor? Next week. So much waiting, and now it's almost here. - You must be really excited. - Yeah. Why do you like Berri Txarrak so much? They've helped me so much since I started listening to them. Ever since school. The thing is, everyone has problems. Instead of turning to other people, I turned to music. Unlike people, music doesn't judge you. You felt more understood. We end up judging without meaning to. You might say something to someone who's struggling, and end up hurting them. I started listening to them at 14, then I started going to gigs... to Berlin when I was doing Erasmus… until now. I think I'm a bit of a freak. People tell me I am. You can never be too freaky. Sure, but you can always be freakier. Where are these madeleines from? These? Lekunberri. No way! Lekunberri! Is the attic like it was when we recorded Jaio.Musika.Hil? No, no. It's completely changed. This is your home, but for me it'll always be the place where we recorded Jaio. I remember how the drums sounded. Later Albini copied you. - Really? - Yeah. The reverberation in there... To record drums like that... Txap-style... In you go. The light? You played here, right? And Txap was there. This was the control room. The demo you made... You brought it to GOR. We did? Yes. Three, maybe all four of you. - Seriously? - Yes. I remember taking them to bars and what not, - but did we go to GOR? - Yes. And right at the end, you were heading out the door, and you said, ''If you ever need someone to work here, I'd be delighted''. - Seriously? - Yes. - Later you took me up on it! - You don't remember, of course. No. But I remember you calling to offer me a job. I was a bit of a nerd. A good student and all that. Always chasing my tail, but I got good grades. I listened to a lot of commercial radio. I discovered rock late on. My classmates would listen to Rock Radical Vasco but I didn't like it. And now, do I regret it? I regret it, I mean, it's shame that I didn't experience it then. For me, the 1980s... Look how important that decade was. They paved the way. We're here now because of that explosion. But I wasn't into all that. Back then, I played keyboard, accordion and that sort of thing. And I listened to loads of commercial radio. Do you remember any songs? It's May, and we're heading to North America. This time, we'll tour the west coast. Portland, Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles... In each city, we inevitably recall at least the name of a group. There's a reason we've recorded our last few records here, in America. We've also been able to work with many musicians that we worship. For example, Bill Stevenson, the drummer in Black Flag, among others. It's amazing, but it was him that convinced us to record our last record, 'Infrasoinuak'. In happened in a dressing room in São Paulo, right after we finished the tour with the Descendents. Ultimately, we're musicians because we were once listeners. What to say, and how, about these dark times that's not been said already, by cartons and fatigue. Where to start digging the tunnel with these songs insipid songs. Because it's already been said somehow or other that they're wolves that do the shepherding. That they were thrown a rope to get them out of the well, not to go around their necks. How to get to the surface. How to get to the surface. Because it's already been said that vultures fly too high beating their pigeon wings. Time is the only polygraph. The rest is speculation. Time is the only polygraph. The rest is speculation. The rest is speculation 5 hotels in 3 days. What do you make of that? A record. On tour, you can lose 23 hours of your day to play for just an hour. Our second home has four wheels, and we've been in it for months. This year, as well as the fans, I feel like it's the BTX Crew that's kept this building upright. Their job is more complicated than ours. They have to set themselves really high standards, knowing that the camera is never pointed at them. And we don't make their job easy. Take the set list, for example. We usually plan it the day of the gig. Little tricks, to fight inertia and the rut. Without them, we'd never have lasted 25 years. It's a pleasure to perform here. Next is a song that's around ten years old now. We recorded it back in 2009, with the great Steve Albini. It's a song about how it feels to walk out on stage and see everything from up here, and the void that follows... ...some philosophical thoughts about writing songs, and sharing them with people, which is what we most like to do. Thanks for being here! This one's called, 'The atheist God'. Don't think that I've invented something new just because I asked you the right questions. Don't think you're safe, forever dancing on the edge of this abyss, because you end up confusing success with happiness. Creating is trying to tackle your inability to communicate. A substitute, ultimately. I don't know, I can write a song but maybe I'm not able to tell the waiter that the soup is cold. Sometimes writing is pure reaction. Afterwards, I think that there's a poetic intention. We seek beauty somehow or other. Maybe to tell some story, and to question the few things that we might hold certain. You accept, of course, that this attempt is doomed to fail. Other times, the pen is an escape, like a marine creature shooting out ink. In the beginning, I was really focussed on the music. The lyrics were... something you had to write to finish the song. Now I think it's the other way around. I have enormous respect for words. It's not about being original. Many things have been said already. But you try to use your own voice. You get rid of all the excess layers. Three with lean pork. With tongue too and three with cheese. I want three with tongue. I'm burning here. Right now it's burning. I didn't know anything. I didn't know the language, who they were, what they played... I was really curious. This was a band that played a gig for just one person, in France. - That's when I started to investigate... - With good reason! …who Berri Txarrak were, because I couldn’t even pronounce their name. Mexico! You bastards! It’s a pleasure for Berri Txarrak to be back in this incredible city. Maybe for the last time. Thank you! This one's called, 'Infrasoinuak'. The infrasounds are coming. The ones we can’t feel. Across the sea. When I saw them there, my legs trembled. I wanted to tell them so many things, ask them so many questions... But in that moment, you wonder if it's real or if you're dreaming. Seeing them live, remembering those moments... - It moves you. - Yes. You feel the magic. You connect with that voice, even though you don't understand all the lyrics. You connect with their energy, their voice... the emotion that Gorka brings to it. It's like a journey. It climbs, and climbs, and climbs and comes down. You feel alive, you feel unique in that moment. I can't remember any time at their gigs when I haven't been totally transfixed. Since this alleged flight started It won't be this alleged flight. Wicked and incorrect A misunderstood drop. Xabi! It looks a bit uncomfortable. Yeah, it sure is. Having breasts... I don't like it much. You can really hear how your voice has changed. Don't you think it'll change you on the inside? Mentally, maybe, sure, but... It'll make me stronger. After everything I've been through... At the end of the day, this is what I want, right? I chose this change, it's what I wanted. I wanted to accept myself, to love myself, and... Well, I'm getting what I wanted. Slowly, but it's happening. And you should do something crazy. Like be happy, or something like it. - Enough? - Yes, enough. Totally fucked? - Why fucked? - It has to sound brutal. - So play properly! - Sure... With no people here... Let's try the Fender and then we'll do a few songs. OK, Mikel. Maybe it'd be cool to play four rounds. Three... Now four. And now it starts. Yeah, it starts on the fourth. And when this riff comes in, the song starts, and the crowd knows which one it is. That could be the right time to turn the stars on, and then I start singing. Sometimes I remember about the need to forget. The racket of those who prevent us from listening. Often I think of Amaia Egaña. With the burst ball from the Bakr brothers. Of that gang of good-for-nothings. There were like... almost seventy shows. When you're on the 23rd you still have more than 55 left, right? I was having a great time. It's been incredible, but as the end gets nearer and you realise... you think: I hope that what I want doesn't come true. It's a bit like that. But great, honestly the audience is incredible. And everyone is watching. The press is watching and everyone is asking how you feel. Well, we all like to play. I've never gotten tired of the hour and a half on stage. You'll never get tired of that. I need that drug and I'm going to keep creating. What I don't know is when, or how, or in what format. It's really alluring, though later I'll panic. But I think it's cool. Sometimes I think of that film… One by Spike Jonze. It's called Her. The film's a bit strange. Part science fiction, a bit Black Mirror... It's about the ideal person, our ideal companion, except they're virtual, they're not a real person. They know you better than yourself. It's a strange concept. The film's alright, but there a point where the protagonist says that he's afraid of feeling nothing new in the future. That phrase... It's scary to imagine that what I feel from now on could be a worse version of something I've already felt. I really identify with that. When I heard it I thought, ''I feel a bit like that''. I've never wanted to use rock or music as a way of resisting. When you gig in another country, it's strange how you automatically think about all the clichés in the country you're about to visit. We've often fallen into that trap. The comments and jokes in the van often revolve around these clichés. Now, for example, we're looking at our fourth Japanese tour. We find ourselves talking about the Shibuya Crossing, Sushi vs. Ramen, the silence of the temples and the latest technology. Manga comics, the streets of Akihabara or Ochanomizu… Maybe we're simply turning into those tourists who hate tourists. It's a good idea to give your audience a lasting memory. Likewise, it's good to bring a lasting memory home. And not just a simple souvenir. We came here to play: fire, and then ashes. Have you got 'Control' there? The one we played before, or not? Yes. - The record by Pedro The Lion. - I've got it. - That'd be cool. - OK. OK, so it's on and people are talking and what not. And when it's time or you tell them... Wero will let me know. We turn it off, and the crowd knows it's about to start, right? OK. OK, and then? You play the instrumental section four times, and after the last one, you play the last chord. Iban! Iban! Wait! It'd be cool to start like that! Galder comes out and sorts them out. I'm looking at the monitors and I think it'd be better if everything wasn't turned on given Gorka will appear there. We need a bit of mystery until he appears. Then, you can turn it on. Otherwise, everyone knows that he's going to enter there. They've kicked the door down. Who are these people that come with no warning? What are they looking for, Dad? Why are they looking right at you? Who are these people, shouting? In the future, someone will remember what happened in this lagoon of oblivion. Fear, the middle name of violence. Who are these people that come with no warning? Now I remember that old piece of advice: Don't trust anyone that's a slave to hatred. In the future, someone will remember everyone who drowned in this lagoon of oblivion. In some new song. In the bark of old trees. In the silver waters of the Arga River. In sunsets. They've kicked the door down. Who are these people that come with no warning? Farewell to my sisters and all my family. Farewell to my friends and to the place where we played. Farewell to my beloved Larraga. In the future, someone will remember everyone who drowned in this lagoon of oblivion. In some new song. In the bark of old trees. In the stars of the Ribera. In Navarre… Let's go! So... I have a group, and we're looking for a space. We saw your ad on the board and I thought I'd come check it out. Sure. The rooms are all the same. We've got 8, and right now 2 are free. If you pay the rent every month the place is yours. We're 4 or 5 so the size is good. Great. You can start whenever you want. OK... How about next month? If it were up to me, we’d be called Pistilo. - Pistilo Errea would be better. - Why? Why? Because the pistil is the female reproductive organ in a flower. I'm not joking! - What does Pistilo mean? - Naia, it's the female reproductive organ, and since there are a lot of girls here... Music groups don't usually have girls. And we sing just as well! But it's not very international. Do you want to go far or do what you like doing? The most important thing is to enjoy it. But we need to be committed. None of this... all guns blazing and then losing interest. Right, Aaron? - Yes, yes. - I'm committed. He'll be the manager... The last few texts are going to focus on the end. Sure, all that's left is the last leg. I would focus the promotion on the WiZink Center. - And on the farewell. - Yes. And on the farewell message in our press release. Sure. But not long interviews rehashing the last 25 years... It should focus more on... ''Basque group that’s going to perform in the WiZink Center''. - The first group. - Yes. It's historic. Do you realise how many fans want to go to multiple gigs? If there were more tickets, more would come. This is a special moment: a farewell, it's all ending for the fans... For all those people who didn't manage to get a ticket, and who now won't be able to... There'll be more people than our gig with Rise Against and Refused? Yes, of course. Crazy! The world has gone mad, I don't understand. Maybe even 3,000 more people. Hello, I'm Koichi Hanafusa. I think you have my photographer pass, for Berri Txarrak. OK, let's see. It should be there. From the manager. - Yes, as part of the crew. - Ah, OK. Yes. Here it says a crew photographer. Yes, I'm here to take photos. - As a member, you get in free. - Really? Thank you. It's fucking great to be back here in Japan for the fourth time. Last time I think it was 2010. It's been too long, I know. Sorry about that Japan, sorry Tokyo. But we're back, so, Thank you. This one is called, 'Zertarako amestu'. We like... We need silence. Like in the subway, you know? Full of people but... Silence, please. And if we're sleeping, why bother to dream? And why wake up, if you're not here? And if we're sleeping, why dream of free days to come? Why dream? It's not an order: it's the majority. It's not pollution: it's progress. Word and image: control. This is the new century in an ancient world. Don't we realise that they distort reality by changing the words? Interpretations and intentions interact. - Because the last time, that was 2008. - Yeah, 2008. Yeah, at FujiRock. I remember... we were like the first band of the festival. Yeah, the opening day. - They cut the ribbon and everybody... - Yes. That was the best time. That was the best time! Cause I was like, the first band, nobody will see us. - It was just the opposite. - Everyone was there. That's, one of the best. Ah yeah, 2012. I still have the pictures you took in ViñaRock. I remember... In the stairs... So cool. We went to the stage... That's the reason why I like your music. I don't understand a word of what you're talking about. - But music, I understand music. - If it is touchy. It's strange, you know. The other side of the world. - Yeah, but the energy of live music... - We share the same thing. That's the Berri Txarrak philosophy: To be born. The Music. To Die. Jaio. Musika. Hil. So why are you finishing? To rest a little bit. To take a break. That means you might be back. Yeah maybe, who knows. That door is open for sure. We're living a great moment but, yeah... It's 25 years. Each stone, a sound. We can make music! - It's like music. - It's like music. - What's the music teacher called? - Amaia. Well, this week she has a surprise for you. You're going to do something with a Berri Txarrak song. Have you bored everyone at school with Berri Txarrak already? Well Amaia really likes them too. Why do they sing in Basque? We'd have to ask them. They've sung and played all over the world. They wanted to, and I think it paid off. - And... - Even though people don't understand. Well, I can listen to groups that I like that sing in English, German or French, although I don't understand them. And I like Lady Gaga, and she sings in English. Our 1000th gig was in New Zealand, in the Antipodes. It made me stop and think. What comes to mind now is the path carved by our predecessors. All the people who have helped us. And the mistakes we've made. And all the things we neglect and never discover because we chose this way of life. A thousand gigs; easy to say. A thousand gigs: always the same, always different. The crowd is always there, making the miracle of live music possible. We owe the crowd everything. Absolutely everything. That's why you don't always have to give them what they ask for. If possible, we grow and learn together, without being paternalistic. ''Respect is the key word''. - First black, right? - The other one for Jare, no? - Shouldn't we have some music on? - Yeah! It’s like we’re going to church or something. Play 'Biziraun'. - Is that your favourite? - Yeah. They might not sing that one today. I think they will. They'll definitely play 'Oihu'. Show me your... This tattoo has rubbed off. No, it's here. No, the one from the last day of school. Ah, OK. Has yours rubbed off too? - I didn't get one. - Really? I queued all morning! It was the worst day. The new trendy plague will be isolation. And your most important job will be to make sure it goes unnoticed. You'll have thousands of filters at your disposal. Freedom will be deciding when and how. And then, yes, we'll finally be free. And then, yes, we'll finally be free. The plural will make it hard to clarify that ''Us'' and ''They'' mean everyone in this dictatorship of ''I''. Spoiler! Spoiler! We won't wait. We won't wait any longer. At FujiRock in Japan in 2008, I didn't understand a word of what they said or sang. But their performance moved me. It wasn't average, or intermediate. It was incredible. And I thought, what is this? Afterwards, I did some digging and found out they were a Basque group called Berri Txarrak. I didn't even know about the Basque Country. I still remember the first time I saw them. I went with my brother to a friend's bedroom and he showed us a YouTube video. We watched the video for 'Oreka'. - Yes, I've seen it too. - You have? I didn't understand what they said, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. It's not fast, or aggressive, but it touches your heart. That's exactly it. After 15 years, I never tire of that song. Me either. I could listen to it forever, because it's too perfect. I've just woken up, and I don't want to open the series of doors that'll probably save me. The windows are enough: nobody is waiting in that street full of people. I've used the light to paint a dream on the skin of this tired town. We'll see how long it lasts You already know that they erase our memory here. It's sad having to celebrate everything when it's all still waiting to be achieved. Balance is worth nothing when you're still on the ground. Balance is worth nothing when it's been ages since you fell. We believed in our own lies. Bored of the lies of others. The contender for leader insists we need a leader. It's sad having to celebrate everything when it's all still waiting to be achieved. Balance is worth nothing when you're still on the ground. Balance is worth nothing when it's been ages since you fell. I've used the light to paint a dream on the skin of this tired town. The contender for leader insists we need a leader. The contender. It's sad having to celebrate everything when it's all still waiting to be achieved. Balance is worth nothing when you're still on the ground. Balance is worth nothing when it's been ages since you fell. Thank you! Thank you so much! It's about time we started broadening our small canon. Thank you! I know there are a lot of young people here. I don't know if you're thinking of starting a band, of writing a book, of starting a dance group. Our language needs active listeners! Rehearsal tomorrow! Rehearsal tomorrow! Yes or no? Let's go! Shall we all crouch down? Yes? OK, crouch down. When we started, if someone had told me that one day we'd attract more than 20,000 people to one of our gigs, I wouldn't have believed them. I still don't think we've come to terms with what happened today at Kobetamendi. After the emotion of today, what's left for the last gig? Swimming in the darkness. In the middle of this forest. The beast watches me. Making a list with no words. I can breathe. If I'm quiet. Swimming in the darkness. Dreaming… Tired arms. And now, ''piztia dut''. I'm the beast that watches. I can see the other shore, but I can't explain. Am I getting nearer, or moving further away? And they talk for me. And they scream for me. The time we have left is a blank canvas that opens up before us. I'm not afraid of the mud. And they talk for me. And they cry for me. As though you could interchange. Our drifts. Our drifts. What shall we do? Shall we play something we know? Yeah. Which one? 'Infra'. To hurt me? Postpone the concerts in Navarra Arena. Let's do the other one... This one... 'Lobby' I don't know if we appreciated the roller coaster of extreme emotions that this year would bring. Probably not. But here we are, at our final rehearsal. And it's all strange. As the end gets nearer, we're all faking some sense of normality, but nothing is normal... In the end, everyone develops their own mechanisms. And it may sound clichéd, but music is our best method. I haven't forgotten you, but I've grown tired of simply remembering you. It's a long time since I gave my details to the happiness lobby. And now... How can I say how amazed I am at people who try to change; All that genuine effort. We can do another one here, on the cover. What've you done here? What's this? We finished the notebook... I accidentally tore it. I'm overwhelmed to see in others, this initiative that I don't have. Let me repeat my mistakes from time to time until I've memorised them. Don't worry: the tireless happiness lobby has had my details for a long time. It's like that when you're young, right? I like a group, and I'm going to do whatever it takes to see them. More so for Berri Txarrak, because they're retiring. You can't criticise me for spending all my savings on seeing them. When does the tour finish? November 23rd. So... OK... Until November 23rd. - And then you'll rest. - No. I'll cry and suffer. - Deep down I'm jealous. - Really? Why? I'd like to feel that passionate about someone or something. I understand… I like music, but not that much. I can't explain it. I can't tell you why I like them so much. The most important things in life can't be explained. You could come too. - But there aren't any tickets. - There are people that sell tickets. What about Malen? Malen should come and see a gig for once. He's never been to a gig. But he won't go to the one that you want. He'll choose what gig he wants to go to. Malen will like Berri Txarrak. Who doesn't? Your cousins from Cameroon didn't think much of them. You're not nervous? - I'm not nervous. - Really? What I am is really cold! - I think you're more nervous than cold. - I'm cold! Someone over there is saying that they've gone to 7 gigs this year. Music is a pillar. That's why we ask for more songs. That's why we'll keep creating. Though sometimes, that responsibility makes us tremble [dardara]. No one knows where the key is hidden. We've been very fortunate. We've managed to open some doors. We've woven a few threads... And this is the embryo of a precious collective memory. No running! Slow down! Every stroke is a step forward. Birth. Music. Life. A river of magma flows beneath everything. It's invisible, but it's so powerful... that you have no choice but to succumb to it. It emanates from the epicentre, and flows between us: it is the quake, and its aftershocks. A vibration that makes us shake off all our worry. Can you feel it? Hands for writing dead messages. Hands for feeling we're together. Hands for applauding risk. Hands for shaping this world. It seemed it would last forever. It ended forever. What can't be done is impossible. We’re coming to the end. It’s been incredible, a perfect farewell. Thank you, Iruñea, and everyone here today. And for your 25 years of support for this band. Much has been said about Berri Txarrak, but what really matters here is the hole that you’re leaving behind. That will be hard to get over. Berri Txarrak is a feeling. Don’t forget it! Thank you, and so long!
