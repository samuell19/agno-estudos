AUDIENCE CHATTER EXCITEDLY AUDIENCE CHEER AND WHISTLE JOE: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Please welcome to the stage your friend and mine it's Mr Joe Lycett! AUDIENCE CHEER AND WHISTLE Oh, lovely, lovely, lovely. Hello, everyone. Are you well? AUDIENCE CHEERS JOE: Oh, lovely! Thank you, lovely. Give me a cheer if you're from London! PEOPLE CHEER Lovely. Give me a cheer if you're from Birmingham. PEOPLE CHEER Oh, sure, which part of Birmingham are you from? MANS VOICE: Walsall. Walsall, gutter trash! Oh, my word! - AUDIENCE LAUGHS I will be slagging you off later on in the show. Don't worry about... Have you travelled from Walsall for the show? JOE: Oh, thank you! Did you get the train? I heard the trains were quite bad. It was fine, it was alright. Oh, lovely... Did you get on the fast one, on the Virgin one, or did you...? No you didn't. The cheap, the Chiltern. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Proper gutter trash this lot. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Lovely air-con on the Chiltern though, isn't it lovely? I do that journey a lot. I wasn't gonna start the show with this. But here we are now... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Well, welcome to the show, thank you so much for coming along. Give me a cheer if you feel like you've travelled the furthest. SOME AUDIENCE MEMBERS CHEER Where have you travelled from? The woman who put her hand up. That's who I'm looking at. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS You weren't expecting a follow up question, were you? AUDIENCE LAUGHS I'm going to come down to your level. Not intellectually, of course. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Hello there. Don't panic, it'll all be fine. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS What's your name? - WOMAN: Flora Hello, Flora, and who are you here with, Flora? JOE: Are you courting? Banging? - AUDIENCE LAUGHS When did we start banging? It's the first date? No, is it actually? And you're this trashed? AUDIENCE LAUGHS JOE: Jesus! Did you... is it a Tinder or is it like... Itis. Oh, OK. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Well this is being immortalised on my DVD you realise! AUDIENCE LAUGHS - JOE: So... I hope you marry. If you get married, I'm coming to the wedding. We're all coming aren't we? AUDIENCE: Yeah! - We can have a lovely time. Maybe have a glass of water in the interval. AUDIENCE LAUGHS - I'm worried about you, Flora. Does someone know you're out? AUDIENCE LAUGHS I mean, I like the look of him, he looks sweet, but you never know. You know you never can... What do you do? What are your prospects? Oh, no. I wasn't asking you, Flora. I feel like you've got lots of prospects You're a psychotherapist, OK. What do you do? MAN: I make stuff in China. You make stuff in China. He's a drug dealer isn't he? He's a drug dealer. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Good luck to you, Flora. What's your name, man that makes stuff in China? MAN: Paul. Paul. Paul and Flora. That sound nice doesn't it? Feels like a... a lasting relationship, I feel. Have you just... How long have you both been single? I feel like we're on Love Island now. AUDIENCE LAUGHS How long have you both been single? Flora? Three years. Two years? OK. Six months, OK. So about time, yes. It's ready to... You know... I've been single for about two years I'm ready to fuck all of you. AUDIENCE LAUGHS This is how I get there. This is how I sort of, allure you in. Just by sitting in this very attractive way. Well, welcome to the filming of my DVD. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Love your top, where's that from? You've no idea, you've stolen a top. AUDIENCE LAUGHS - What's your name? GIRL: Zara. Zara, hello Zara. Is there any chance that it's from Zara. AUDIENCE LAUGHS What do you think of this top? ZARA: I like it. Do you like it? What do we think? AUDIENCE CHEERS Right, cos... so I don't normally wear this. Apparently, cos we're filming it the shirt that I normally wear's a bit much. But I put it here - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Apparently this is a bit much, I mean... look at this. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I wanted to wear that. - AUDIENCE WHISTLES I couldn't work out if it looked like, I'd sort of collapsed at a marathon. Do you know what I mean? - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Julian Clary had fucked a Ferrero Rocher and here we are. So I've gone with this number. Welcome along. I'm so thrilled that you're all here. And there's all these bloody cameras everywhere. Thank you so much for coming. This is extraordinary, there are so many of you, it's lovely. Who are you here with, Zara? Is this your fr-- Hello, Jess. Nice to see you, Jess. Are you well? - JESS: I'm great. Are you eating well, are you hydrated? AUDIENCE LAUGHS What are you drinking? Two Heinekens! Oh, my God. Look at these basic bitches down here on the front row. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I like it though... I'd love to have a drink. I might have one later, I feel like I've got stuff to do now. I'llhave one later. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Give me a cheer if you're drinking. AUDIENCE CHEERS Yes, lovely, good. I did dry January. Did anyone do dry January? AUDIENCE CHEER No, I don't recommend it. Yes, I learnt one thing - my friends are fucking boring, that's what I learnt. AUDIENCE LAUGHS If I have to look at another baby picture, sorry if you're preg or if you're had a child, but just spare me your shit. Honestly! - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Really good way of not looking at baby pictures repeatedly and aggressively shout HE SHOUTS: No! AUDIENCE LAUGHS They go away after a while, it's marvellous, marvellous... Did dry... I've done it twice now. I did it last year, when I was living with mother and father, Dave and Helen. Great couple of lads. And um... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS This might be over-sharing this early on in the show, but as a result of dry January I got a lot of "morning wood", shall we say? A little... stiffy in the D, as us lads say don't we, and um... A mechanic came round to collect my car and Mum answered the door. She shouted up, she said "Joe, you got your car keys?" I was having a dream about Idris Elba. AUDIENCE LAUGHS As is my right! AUDIENCE LAUGHS I had a little tent effect in the pyjamas - not a full yurt, just a tent and I... I tried to supress it with my hand in my pyjama pocket but it didn't really work so what I did is I tucked it between my legs. I don't know if anyone has walked down a staircase with a semi trapped in their gooch. AUDIENCE LAUGHS But it's fraught with peril. I managed... I got to the bottom step and then I tripped and it sprang out. AUDIENCE LAUGHS A sort of baby punching its way out of my man-gina Anyway, long story short, the car's fine but mum's not happy, she's not happy. I will be slagging her off later on in the show. So don't worry about that. Helen will be getting it, both barrels. Did, um... Did dry January again this year for different reasons. I went to the doctor last summer and I was feeling tired all the time and he did some tests and apparently I'm deficient. I'm deficient in vitamins B D, folic acid and Omega 3. And he said, one: eat better cos I eat loads of trash and also go to a pharmacy, get a supplement with all of these in you'll start to feel better. So I went to Boots. The only supplement that has all of these in is pregnancy support. So... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS I've been on pregnancy support for the last few months and I'll tell you what, I feel like a pregnant woman. I sit down backwards onto chairs, I do that one. Talk about myself the whole fucking time. I'm a pregnant woman. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Sorry if you're preg. I'm gonna be slagging you off now. It's just I'm turning 30 this year and so many of my friends are having kids. I've got a text actually, which you can use if you'd like. I'm so thrilled with it. If somebody's just had a baby I'll text them, I'll say, "Are you sleeping?" Cos, inevitably they won't be and they go "Oh, no I haven't slept for days". That kind of reply... nonsense, and then I'll... go back and I'm so thrilled with the wording of this. I go back and I say "It'll all be worth it when they're softly stroking your hair as you slip into oblivion". AUDIENCE LAUGHS It's like Shakespeare, isn't it marvellous? Met one of my friend's kids last year. A friend I went to university with, her daughter. I avoided this child for four years, she's four years old. I'd heard bad things. Met her last year. She's the worst person I've ever met. AUDIENCE LAUGHS And I've met Eamonn Holmes! AUDIENCE LAUGHS I won't use her real name, that would be unfair. Let's call her... Mugabe. And she was very... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Just spoilt, really. We were sat at dinner and she was here and she was kicking me in the legs. And at one point she caught my shin and I went "fuck!" She started crying, the mum said "Please don't swear in front of my child". I was like "Oh, is that your child?" I thought someone just condensed North Korea into a small woman, actually. AUDIENCE LAUGH Little bitch. But I've got a, um... I've got a god daughter who I adore. She is eleven and I think she might be a genius. Cos, um... she loves painting, and I've got this office in Birmingham. So I took her to the office to do some painting and we painted this mural on the wall. And while we were painting it, I said to her, I said "What do you think art is?" Just out of curiosity. And she thought about it and she said "Well, it's trust". And I said "What do you mean by that?" And she said "Well, if you trust something's good, then itis." I was like, fucking hell it's the most... AUDIENCE LAUGHS - ...profound thing anyone's ever said to me. From an eleven-year-old! I was like, have another go on the bong. What are you gonna say next? AUDIENCE LAUGHS When the meow meow came out, the things she was saying... extraordinary! So yes, I'm trying to be healthier, I love a full fat coke and I'm on diet cokes now and I'm struggling with it, really. Funnily enough, I was at a university reunion drinking a diet coke and I went up to a girl who I didn't know that well at university and I was holding this diet coke, and... I said to her, I said "Oh, hello, how are you, what are you up to now?" And she went "I hate that, I hate small talk". I'm sorry, I'm not sure how conversation works with you now then. "How did the death of your father affect your sex life?" Just straight on in... AUDIENCE LAUGHS She said, "You shouldn't be drinking that", and I said "Why?". Now what I think she meant to say was "It's full of aspartame”. What she actually said was, "You shouldn't be drinking that". "It's full of apartheid." AUDIENCE LAUGHS I knew it was bad, didn't realise it was that bad, bloody hell! I tried being a fruitarian. That's where you can only eat things that have fallen from trees. I managed one day. I had three cooking apples... and an owl. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Arguably the best joke of the show, that. Pissed it away in the first section, there she goes. AUDIENCE LAUGHS - Off she flies! Bless you. - AUDIENCE APPLAUD I have another version of that joke which was three cooking apples and a small boy but I felt like it was potentially too much. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Um, we're gonna go to an interval shortly. Before we do that, I'd like to tell you about a little project I've been working on with the EDL, the English Defence League. Any member in? Any members? - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Occasionally there's a crossover with my audience with the EDL. If you're not familiar with the EDL they don't like Muslims or hair. Those are the two things they despise. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Muslims and hair. There was a rally last summer. A rally in Birmingham. You might have seen this picture from it. This is a girl called Sophia Khan. She was facing up to one of the EDL members - AUDIENCE CHEER with this... Yes, she's amazing, Sophia Khan. With this serenity and calmness on her face with all this aggression from the EDL member. In the weeks preceding this rally I discovered somebody I went to school with who I am erroneously still friends with on Facebook is a member of the EDL and was trying to generate support for this rally with his own Facebook group. Now, I like to troll people on social media... AUDIENCE LAUGHS - ...using various aliases that I create. So I went on as Angela Middlebin. AUDIENCE LAUGHS And I wrote: "Hi, guys looking forward to the rally in Brum later. Think it will be a lovely day for it. I work in PR with some high-profile right wing, and right-leaning commentators such as Katie Hopkins Piers Morgan and Fern Britton", Now... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Fern Britton is, I don't think, right-wing in any way but she blocked me on Twitter so fuck her! AUDIENCE LAUGHS I mean, Fern Britton of all people! I felt like I'd been blocked by Ghandi! AUDIENCE LAUGHS I'm now un-blocked. I should mention that... um... it's a long story, really. I won't go into it. There was a threat on her life, let's move on. AUDIENCE LAUGHS JOE IN A VILLAIN VOICE: She'll be dead by dusk! AUDIENCE LAUGHS She won't. She's actually a very nice lady. I continued, "One of my clients brought to my attention the fact that there is an organisation already using the name EDL. This is all true, I did some research. It is a company called Electricité De Liban and supplies electricity to the country of Lebanon. According to recent stats, Lebanon is 54% Muslim which means, in effect, that the EDL is powering Muslims. AUDIENCE LAUGHS As a result I think an immediate re-brand of the EDL and change of name ahead of the rally is necessary. I've discussed this with my colleagues in the office and we have come up with the name "Eyes On Islam" or "Eyesis" for short. AUDIENCE LAUGHS See you all there, love Angela". Within three minutes, somebody called Ben, put "Uh... ‘join Eyesis' sounds a lot like ISIS", JOE, SARCASTICALLY: Well done, Ben! AUDIENCE LAUGHS He suggested, "What about UK defence league?" You could have @ukdl on Twitter. Now, I did some research into this to see if this is viable. Unfortunately for Ben, it's not. There's already and @ukdl account on Twitter. Um, you can... it's private but you can read the blurb. This is the blurb. "We all start off in nappies, many of us will end up in them so why not enjoy them in between as well? It's an adult nappy wearer. AUDIENCE LAUGHS - Which is... Fine! Each to their own, you do you but I'm not sure the vibe the EDL is going for. So I suggested, "What about the Islamic Cessation Group or 'I-CEASE!' for short?" AUDIENCE LAUGHS Ben puts, "Still sounds like ISIS." JOE, SARCASTICALLY: Well done, Ben! AUDIENCE LAUGHS I put, "How about: Islam Should Immediately Stop" or "ISIS, for short?" - AUDIENCE LAUGHS He worked it out then. He put, "fuck off this group, Angela". AUDIENCE LAUGHS - I said "OK, Ben, sorry for the hassle. I've got to go to the opticians anyway. Got a pus-filled growth on my cornea. I think it's an eye cyst." AUDIENCE LAUGHS Bit of pun fun there. AUDIENCE CLAPS AND CHEERS Bless you. Right, interval time. I often think my audiences are funnier than I am. So I'd like to test that theory with a little Twitter game. and I'd like you to tweet me in with "Make a TV presenter sexy". Something like Jizzy Carr but... funnier than that. That's the best I can come up with. Send as many as you can think of in. We'll go through the best ones after the interval. We'll do 20 minutes and then that's it. See you shortly. AUDIENCE APPLAUD AND CHEER So what did you think? You call that a joke? Oh, I'm sorry, I'll try better next time. - Not better... Best! - I know, I'm sorry I've let you down. I've really let you down. Yes, you should be ashamed of yourself. Ashamed, I tell you. Right, I'm really feeling like I can do better this time. Not better, best! Ok, best. Show me the money! - JOE: I will! AUDIENCE APPLAUD AND CHEER Ah, lovely. Thank you. Good interval? Good interval? My agent was being a real prick back there. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I've been reading your tweets, some fucked-up people in this room. Oh! Right! Um, if I call your name out... If I read one of your tweets out can you stand up for us? Could we have house lights up for this, as well just so I can see them? JOE MAKES COMEDY NOISE OF DISGUST AUDIENCE LAUGHS Oh, also... Leon are you alright to..? This is Leon, everybody. Say "Hi, Leon". AUDIENCE SHOUTS: Hi, Leon. Are you alright to come out? So, they've said this is my cameraman, I can do whatever I like with him. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I mean, if anyone's got suggestions... Hello, Leon. Can we... lets... $0 we're gonna zoom in on people. Oh, lovely. Look at that. Let's just have a test, oh yes. What are these guys... What's your names? Tony. - Tony and...? Richard. - Tony and Richard. How do you know each other, Tony and Richard? Partners. - Partners, OK. We've got a lovely picture there. Smile for us. Very nice. That's going straight on Twitter when we've finished the show. AUDIENCE LAUGHS - Find these men! Right, let's have a look at your tweets. Um... there's some really funny ones. Really funny ones. Some people didn't really understand. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Oh, love "Zoe Ball Bag" from Fraser, that's good. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Oh, where is Fraser, actually? Stand up Fraser. "Fraser C04", Where are you? Hello Fraser. Hundred and three followers. Hundred and four now, I'm following you. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I will follow you home. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Um... you sent in "Joe Likes Dick". AUDIENCE LAUGHS AUDIENCE CHEERS - Thanks mate. He's not wrong, he's not wrong. Just like it, I'm not in love with it, I like a dick. AUDIENCE LAUGHS - I like a dick. Thanks Fraser, round of applause for Fraser. AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AND CHEERS There's something rather... "Mel and Sue", somebody's put "Bell and Poo". AUDIENCE LAUGHS This one's really nice. Where's Dave Moore? Dave Moore. Tweet time, Dave. Where are you? You up top there, as well? You only sent one in, Dave. You haven't given much information on your profile, either, You've got 92 followers. Um... the last thing you did was re-tweet Jonathan Ross. This isn't a Jonathan Ross-based tweet. What do you do, Dave? A finance analyst? Gosh it's boring people up there, isn't it? AUDIENCE LAUGHS Where d'you live, Dave? MALE VOICE: He's from Ashford in Kent. In Kent, oh! - SOME PEOPLE CHEER Oh! - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Mixed response from the room for Kent. People down here not sure they like Kent. Then some other people over there love it. Hey, it takes all sorts doesn't it? You sent in, Dave "Tess Sucks Off Your Dad, Daily". That's really nice. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Really lovely, round of applause for Dave. Lovely stuff. "Daily". "Sucks Off Your Dad, Daily"! Mike Blaire, where are you? "Pickle246". Where is he? Right at the back, quite right! AUDIENCE LAUGHS - Let's have a look at your profile. Twenty-two years old, Arsenal... You're an Arsenal fan? JOE IN A LADDISH VOICE: Oh-hey! Qo-hey! - AUDIENCE LAUGHS D'you watch the game, geezer? AUDIENCE LAUGHS Great squad innit, great squad. Lovely um... lovely s-s-squad? AUDIENCE LAUGHS - Was there a game today? I don't know. No idea. Um... you like tennis, food and travelling, lovely. Mike sent in, "Benedict Cum-In-Her-Snatch". So that's... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Great bit of lad banter, that! Qoooh-aye! Did you get a nice shot of him? Lovely, thanks, Leon. You're a bloody lifesaver. You can't catch me. AUDIENCE LAUGHS He's good, isn't he? D'you... you don't have to say anything just nod if... or shake your head. Do you run? Are you a runner? Not really. So if I ran away? AUDIENCE LAUGHS Are you a fighter? AUDIENCE LAUGHS I'll kill you, dead. Oh, he's frightened now. God, I've never felt more masculine! AUDIENCE LAUGHS - I've got a weapon, as well. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I actually thought I was gonna do it then! No, I like you, Leon, you've got a good spirit... and lovely soft palms... Next, um... LAUGHTER Right, I've got two favourites, let's find the two faves. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Where... Where's Nicola Bosdet. Nicola? Hello... where are you? Oh, there you are, oh I love... what colour... You wearing a pink top? Is that pink? Orange, can't see colours. Gone colour blind on this show. Oh, caution, this account is temporarily restricted. That's literally just come up. You're seeing this warning because there's been some unusual activity from this account. Genuinely is! - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Look at that! Unusual? Have you used twitter recently? I forgot my login so he made a new one. You've made a new login? Well before... I'm still seeing the tweet though. You sent it "David Dick-In-Your-Son". AUDIENCE LAUGHS Is it the sort of thing that you normally tweet? AUDIENCE LAUGHS Somebody else tweeted it for you? Oh, I love that! Oh, Nicola, like I literally can't go to your account now. Oh, I pressed "Yes, view profile" now. Zero followers, OK. One follower AUDIENCE LAUGHS And that's literally your only tweet! I love that. Well, nice to meet you, Nicola. Final one, where's Pippa Lohran, am I saying that right? Lochran, Lo-ran? Where are you? Hello, Pippa. Where you from Pippa? Manchester. Oh, I love Manchester, I lived there for four years. Um, do you still... - WOMAN CHEERS Yeah cool! Um... do you know her? AUDIENCE LAUGHS Do you still live in Manchester? - No, no. Oh, no, no, I'm better than that now! AUDIENCE LAUGHS - Where do you live now, Pippa? Harrow - In H-- AUDIENCE LAUGHS - In Harrow, lovely. You've got 83 followers. I'll give you a follow, why not. Your background is of Adele. You like Adele? - Love her. I love Adele, yeah, I went to see her live, as well. Oh, you sent in quite a few but you sent in my absolute favourite one which was, "Adrian Child-Molester". It's really good! - AUDIENCE LAUGHS What I love about it as well, is that you seemed so sweet! And you sent in "Adrian Child-Molester". Round of applause for Pippa, round of applause for everyone. AUDIENCE APPLAUD - Marvellous... shall we um... Shall we take a selfie using that camera? Is that possible? Where shall we do it from? Maybe back here? You all want to be in a selfie? AUDIENCE SHOUT: Yeah! Like... can I hold it, like I'm doing a... Smile everyone! AUDIENCE LAUGHS Cool, I think we've got it. Round of applause for Leon! AUDIENCE APPLAUD AND CHEER Thanks Leon. Right, let's talk about art now. I'd like to talk about art. Yeah, a bit of culture. My mother retired a few years ago and she's now painting in her retirement. This is one of my mother's paintings. Isn't it glorious? This is of our family friend, Patrick Not only does it look like Patrick I feel like it captures his essence, a beautiful painting. Based on these, I've been inspired to do my own. They've not come out as well, I'm gonna be honest with you. I did one of Amanda Holden with a Britain's Got Talent buzzer for a head. Slightly different things that we do. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Mum will do this sort of thing - two women on a bench, having a conversation. Beautiful, skilful watercolour there. The skill and the time it takes to do something like that. I did a man having coffee poured in his arse. We're just doing different things! - AUDIENCE LAUGHS We're doing different things. This came out of... I was on holiday with a friend of mine who'd just had a colonic irrigation. I've never had one, so I was like, "What's it like?" He's like, "I've not had one either". This girl, quite attractive, took me into a room, put a tube up and I thought the tube did everything but actually she took it out stood me over this thing and then just said "Go". And she said, "I can wait here, or I can wait outside, whatever you want", I was like, "Who's asking her to stay?" AUDIENCE LAUGHS "Nol "Look me in the eye!" AUDIENCE LAUGHS - "I'd like us to share this!" So based on that, I did this painting. I haven't got a name for it yet. I was thinking, maybe, "Britain in Springtime" but I'm open to suggestions. Please send your tweets in. This art thing has got to a bit of a head just this week, actually. Mum and I, we submitted to the Royal Academy. Every year, the Royal Academy take paintings from amateurs from professionals, whatever, They also take sculptures. Mum submitted two of her paintings, beautiful paintings. I submitted for a laugh. I knew I wasn't gonna get in, I submitted this sculpture which I called "Chris". I made it, pissed last summer. I just submitted it, forgot about it. A few weeks later I got an email from the Royal Academy that read this - "Dear Joe, it has come to our attention that the price of your artwork Chris, is £10.5 million. I was originally gonna do ten and then I thought "fuck it" and put the other half on. "Owing to the high selling price we just wanted to check this was correct and this is what we would like to have printed in our list of works should your work be selected for the exhibition. If you did wish for this to be the published price could you kindly advise on the insurance value of the work". Well, I went back to them and I said "Gosh, did I really put £10.5 million? It should be £12.5 million!" And then just put "Brexit" for no reason. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I recently took it to Bonhams to get it valued. They asked me to leave, but I expect the insurance value is £4.99 or the equivalent in Argos vouchers. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Didn't receive a reply, didn't expect a reply to be honest. I thought, right you know, it's not gonna get in. Suddenly we both get emails. Mum's paintings, rejected, "Chris", is in! Igo... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS I got to the Royal Academy I went there on Monday. There I am outside, very excited. All the other sculptures are on plinths. I'm like, "bloody hell, Chris is gonna be on a plinth in the Royal Academy!" The Royal Academy of Art, in bloody London! Walking round, I can't find him anywhere. They've only gone and put him in the fucking corner, haven't they! Jeez! - AUDIENCE LAUGHS He is available to purchase for £12.5 million. I will not accept offers. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Mum's really annoyed at the minute, the relationship's frayed. This started... I was living with them last year and they got annoyed with my bathroom habits. I love a long bath. And I love to eat in the bath. And I had some Greek yoghurt in the bath cos I'm in show business. And unbeknownst to me, some of the yoghurt ended up in the bath. I then went into my room to get changed Mum comes into the bathroom, looks in the bath, she's like "Have you had the biggest wank anyone's ever had?" "I came in, there's blueberries in there as well!" "Oh, yeah, I've shat out perfect blueberries as well, Helen". "Just squeezed those through my urethra!" AUDIENCE LAUGHS The real friction is on Twitter. You can follow her, she posts her paintings she also searches not only my name, but searches what people are writing to me what people are writing about me s0 she will have seen all the tweets that you sent tonight. She loves reading them, she'll go through all of them. And she also, sometimes, will show me tweets when like, I've been on tele. Every time you go on tele there's a bit of nastiness. It comes with the job. There was one she showed me which I loved which was, I'd just been on Blankety Blank with David Walliams, which, to be fair, was dog shit. And I, um... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS I got a tweet which just said "You're not funny". And I appreciated the succinctness of the tweet but what I loved about it is I looked at the woman's profile who'd sent it and she's a self-esteem coach! AUDIENCE LAUGHS Maybe she's the self-esteem coach of a rival comedian. Maybe Romesh was feeling down on his luck. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Thought he'd bring me down. But this is something I'm getting used to but like... Sometimes people now tweet when they've seen me out and about. Say they've seen me somewhere, they might take a picture and that's fine, comes with the job. But sometimes I don't want Mum to know where I've been. And this... The worst example for this... I said to her one morning, I said "I'm going to Manchester to see my friend Josephine. We're gonna have a light lunch and then I'm gonna get the train back to Birmingham". Went to Manchester, got totally shit-faced with Josephine had a pasty on the train on the way home. Little pasty to soak up the alcohol. Got home, mum was like "Oh, being healthy are you?" I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I had a couple of glasses of wine but I had a salad at lunch". She was like, "Explain this". Somebody took a picture of me on the bloody train, didn't they! AUDIENCE LAUGHS Really enjoyed that pasty, as you can see. Looks worryingly like that when you put it together, as well. I could have been Prime Minister! Oh, I got her back though, cos I did a tweet. It wasn't actually about her but she was offended by it, anyway. The tweet was, "to find out your dirty prostitute name take your mother's surname and put her first name in front of it". AUDIENCE LAUGHS One thousand re-tweets! Thank you, Twitter, AUDIENCE LAUGHS So based on that, and also just because, like... I'm turning 30 this year I've moved out. I've moved into an up-and-coming area of Birmingham. Whether it'll up or come or not, I don't know. Um... it's called Kings Heath. The area that I'm in. - SOME PEOPLE CHEER Oh, can I have a lift? AUDIENCE LAUGHS I thought I was buying a nice place, really, but it's a bit of a dump. And like all of... there's like damp in there and all sorts of problems and my dad, who's just retired, he's taken over as project manager of the project. The official reason for this is that I'm too busy to co-ordinate all of the works myself, Couldn't possibly do it all myself. The real reason is I can't speak to tradesmen. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I tried to speak to the electrician over Whatsapp, he doesn't like an emoji! Oh! - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Four aubergines, he got very confused. Dad's been amazing, he seems to know... He was a teacher before he retired he knows loads of stuff about houses. He goes up to floorboards and he'll go... "Ah" - won't tell me what that means but he knows something! AUDIENCE LAUGHS - There was a door that needed fixing. He just came round and made and fitted a door. How do you know to do that? You're a teacher. He's like, "I don't know, I just sort of know from birth". From birth? Sorry, all the other kids are in the nursery crying and you're there making a trestle table. Come on, mate! I think what happens... it has to. When you become a father you go to some sort of "Dad school" where they teach you how to do all of this shit but not how to get emotion into a text message. AUDIENCE LAUGHS The messages I send to father, long rambling endeavours. "Just landed, wonderful holiday. Food was fantastic, weather was glorious. Happy to be back, but sad to not be in that wonderful weather. How are you? Is all well?" The reply will just be "Yes, fine". AUDIENCE LAUGHS Are you a hostage? AUDIENCE LAUGHS I find it quite weird talking about my father on stage. I never did it. I've been doing stand up for ten years. And I didn't do it when he was a teacher because I didn't want to undermine his authority but also there's just no real friction with my dad, really. He's just a lovely man, we just get on really well. When I came out as bisexual on my 21st birthday obviously very nervous about that, didn't really know what he was gonna say. And he was so lovely. I said to him, I said "Dad, I think I might be bisexual" and he went "That's fine, as long as you're happy. I don't mind, whatever". And I was sort of annoyed, I was sort of like "Punch me, give me a story!" I tried to escalate it. JOE SHOUTS: "I'm taking drugs!" AUDIENCE LAUGHS - "Don't tell your mother". AUDIENCE LAUGHS “I'm listening to Snow Patrol", "Get out of my house!" AUDIENCE LAUGHS So he's been amazing, he's been extraordinary. I've also been getting help with the house from a friend of mine called Peter. You'll learn a lot about Peter in this show. He's one of my oldest, dearest friends. He's hard to explain in a short way, in a sort of, succinct way. I find a good way of giving you a bit of an idea of what Peter's like is to tell you that he once tried to spend 24 hours, in a 24-hour Tesco. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Like it was a challenge. He got kicked out after 21 hours for trying on too many clothes. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I've known him for like, since we were about 12. We didn't go to the same school, but we had similar friendship groups. We've grown up together, We didn't fall out, but we fell apart cos he went to Japan after university and he's just been back for about a year and now he's back, he's doing little jobs. Different things, trying to make ends meet. One of the jobs he does, because he speaks fluent Japanese is to teach people in England-- Japanese people in England-- how to speak English. And he's got a middle-aged student called Aiko who he set some homework for, The homework was an email. I pride myself on writing emails. Aiko's written, I think, the greatest email in the history of email. The homework was to write an informal email of complaint with an aggressive tone. AUDIENCE LAUGHS This is what she actually wrote. "Dear Sarah You probably know why I'm writing, you bitch!" AUDIENCE LAUGHS I want to start every email with that from now on. "You smashed glasses and made terrible racket. It was so evil, daft bastard!" AUDIENCE LAUGHS "Whatever, make up for it immediately. Bobs your uncle, Aiko". Isn't that extraordinary? - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Full marks, of course. AUDIENCE CHEERS Love it! I mean, props to Aiko, it's hard to learn a language. I'm trying to learn German at the minute. I went with German because I just thought it was funny. Hazelnut, Haselnuss, it's a funny language. And I'm using Duolingo. Do people use Duolingo? AUDIENCE CHEERS - It's good isn't it? It gives you like, a composite sentence. It sounds like I'm sponsored, I'm not, it's just a good app. They give you composite sentences that get progressively harder. One of my friends is on really advanced German at the minute and one of the sentences he had to translate the other week is "It is a war crime". I'm not sure when that's gonna be useful, really. Wandering round Berlin "This sauerkraut is disgusting". "It is a war ctime how disgusting it is". - AUDIENCE LAUGHS So yeah, Peter's helping me out. Peter, he's a really funny guy. He loves comedy and we go to the pub a lot and we sort of tiff on comedic ideas. He loves to create comedy characters. He likes to create the ideas of what people could be like and he's created one that I love which is the idea of a homeless man who's into really specific things. So, you know that most homeless people will ask for enough for a cup of tea. That kind of thing. He likes the idea of a homeless man that goes IN A DEEP VOICE: "Sorry mate, I can see you're busy. You haven't got a manual for a Fiat Punto have you?" AUDIENCE LAUGHS Really specific stuff. IN A DEEP VOICE: Sorry mate, I shouldn't ask I shouldn't ask, you haven't got a Fabergé egg have you? Just really weird stuff! Brilliant, brilliant at it. But he's also a prankster, He's a troll, and I'm a troll, but he did it to me, and I didn't like it! It was one of the worst things that happened to me and actually, funnily enough, it's happened to me here. We were in the pub a week before I was doing the Royal Variety. It was only with Charles and Camilla not the proper ones, who gives a shit? And... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS He said to me, he said "How are you feeling about Royal Variety" and I said, "I'm really nervous, like I don't know what I'm gonna say". There's like, loads of protocol, obviously you can't swear but there's loads of things you wouldn't realise, little things that you can't say. And I said, "I'm really nervous I don't know what I'm gonna do". And he knew what he was doing cos he went... "Well, wouldn't want to say Diana was murdered, would you?" AUDIENCE LAUGHS - No! Why did you put that in my head the week before Royal Variety? Fuck sake! It was rolling around my head, the whole bloody week. And I was stood, side of stage, it was literally just there. Royal Variety, cos it was in this room. And I was quaking with nerves and I don't normally get that nervous about stand up. Got my little jacket on. I was really shivering with nerves, I could see Charles and Camilla through a gap in the curtain. They were up there somewhere. Proper shaking and I was going through my notes on my phone to remind myself of what I was going to do what my material was gonna be and I shouldn't have told him, but I told him what time I was going on stage and he texts me seconds before I went on stage and it was just a picture of Diana on her wedding day. AUDIENCE LAUGHS And then underneath "Don't let her down". - AUDIENCE LAUGHS LAUGHING CONTINUES Absolute bell-end. So he's been helping out. I say he's been helping out, he's been giving me bad advice, actually. There was an archway in the living room and it had a fireplace in it years ago and I didn't know what to do with it and he went "Oh, you like posh things, why don't you get a log burner?" So I got a log burner on his advice since discovered, from a quite sanctimonious friend of mine shouldn't have got a log burner. They came round, they were like "Actually, you shouldn't have got a log burner. It's very bad for the environment to burn logs. I'll send you a book about it". And to be fair, the book burnt beautifully. That was lovely. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Farrow & Ball paint. He suggests, "Oh, you like posh things, get posh paint, Farrow & Ball paint". Farrow & Ball has a shop in Solihull. In the Midlands, in Birmingham. Solihull is still Birmingham. It's a posh part of Birmingham, so there's still vomit on the streets but there's mangetout in it in Solihull. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS The colour names in Farrow & Ball... "Elephant's Breath". Grey! That's an abstract name they've given to grey. I think you should be able to go into Farrow & Ball with your own colour names abstract names and they just have to create the colour they think you're on about. You go and say, "Yes, I was thinking of painting the living room..." "Disappointed Wife". Just see what they come up with. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS "Hmm, I was thinking, in the bedroom "David Dick-In-Your-Son", Just whatever they think that is! Well, the guy in the Farrow & Ball shop is so posh, he's like HE BABBLES: Bwa-bwa-bwa-ba... You know, he's like that. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Right, I've realised this... I'm not sure if you'll get this reference. I've realised that's quite close to an impression that I do of Jessie from Little Mix, doing a Jamaican accent. OK, some of you know this. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS If you don't, treat yourself after the show. Jesus, oh! How to describe this, so... Little Mix are a band, I'm sure you know Little Mix, four of them. Uh, they were doing like a promo video, I think it was and they had these cards that had accents on and Jessie, one of the members, got "Jamaican" and this is literally what she did, she went "Oh, um..." HE BABBLES: Bwar-de-den-de... That was it! AUDIENCE LAUGHS - HE SNIGGERS: So... That was the guy in Farrow & Ball, he was that posh. HE BABBLES: Bwar-de-den-de... That was how posh he was. I went in, I said hello. He went "Bwar-de-den-de..." You're Jamaican. "Bwar-de-den-de..." "Bwar-de..." What was she thinking? HE SNIGGERS So, I went in, I said hello, "Bwar-de-den-de" um... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS And I said... and I said, "I'm buying some paint" "I'm doing the living room" and he said IN POSH VOICE: Are you doing it yourself? And I said "Yeah", and he said IN POSH VOICE: Have you painted before? And I said, "No". And he went... - HE GASPS THEATRICALLY AUDIENCE LAUGHS and I said "Oh, no I tell a lie. I've done this one of Paul Chuckle, sorry". AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND CHEERS He... He said, well... IN POSH VOICE: "I don't much like that". Well, Paul Chuckle was fucking thrilled with it, actually, so... AUDIENCE APPLAUD AND CHEER This thing is so silly. I did that painting as an exercise. I just thought he had a funny face, I thought I'd paint his face. And I put it on Twitter, didn't send it to him. Somebody did, cos he got in touch he said "Joe, I love that painting you've done of me. My wife got me some paints for Christmas, I want to learn how to paint. If you send me the one you've done of me, I'll do one of you". This is a Paul Chuckle original! AUDIENCE LAUGHS It sort of looks like me crossed with The Joker after a stroke but I'm happy with it! - AUDIENCE LAUGHS First thing to go up in my house. I love taking people round, they're like "Hmm, what is that?" Made by Paul fucking Chuckle, actually so... AUDIENCE LAUGHS I do love that painting. There's a few things I love about the house. I love a gadget so I've got an Alexa. Have people got Alexas? A FEW PEOPLE CHEER - I quite like... If you don't know what it is, it's like a little disk and you call it Alexa, and she does things for you. I literally got it because I wanted to teach her sinister things. That's literally the only reason. I just wanted, when friends have come round for dinner and they were leaving They'll say, "Lovely to see you, Joe. Thank you so much for having us". I just wanted to go, "Alexa..." "Lock the doors". AUDIENCE LAUGHS I've got these plugs, as well, that connect to the lights and it means that I can turn the lights on using Alexa. And I've given all the lights in my house middle-aged receptionist names. So... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS When I go up to the bedroom I go "Alexa..." "Turn Susan on". Feels nice. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS A lot of comics, a lot of writers will have next to their bed, a pad and pen where they'll jot down ideas - things that come to them at 4am in the morning that they think are genius. I used to have the pad and pen but I never used it cos I couldn't be bothered really, when woke up. Now I've got Alexa, I do it all the time. I ask her to remind me of stuff all the time. Here are my four favourite things that I've asked Alexa to remind me - One: glory hole in a glass door. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Not sure if I was going to pitch that to Dragons Den. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Oh, a solution to the drugs problem which actually, I think is quite good. In my utopia all drugs are legal but they're all £1 and you have to really want them because the only way to access them is in those grabber machines that they have at fairs. Waking someone to tell them something unimportant. I just love the idea of running in to Mum, and going... Mum. Mum-mum-mum-mum-mum! I'm really enjoying the latest series of Game of Thrones. AUDIENCE LAUGHS And finally, who called them turtle necks and not ugly, shit clothes? Who did that? I don't know who did that. Showed Alexa to Peter when he came round, when I first got her. I said, "That's good isn't it? She answers questions, plays music..." He's like, "It's a piece of shit". Disappeared into the house. Next morning, I was talking to my father at 11am on the dot cos I remember it very vividly cos Alexa pops up and goes... "This is your daily reminder to suck a dog's cock". AUDIENCE LAUGHS 11am is early for that, I feel. 3:45 at the earliest, I find for sucking a dog's cock. I've also... Another thing I love about the house, I've got an off licence. I love the off licence. It's an off licence sort of grocery. Baz, who runs it, my new best friend. He came round to the house when we were doing the works. I was outside, and he said, "Oh, can I have a look?" I said, "Oh, yeah." I showed him the attic and said, "This will be my bedroom". And he said, "What d'you do?" and I said, "Oh, I'm a comedian". And he went "Oh". And that was the extent of the conversation. Next day, I went into the shop, it was really busy. He ran up to me, he went "You didn't say you were a TV comedian". I said, "Oh, yeah. I've been on tele a bit". "It's not that big a deal, let's not make a fuss". And he went, "Gonna have fun up in that attic". And I said... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS "W-What d'you mean by that?" And he went, "With all the comedy girls". And I went, "Oh, chance would be a fine thing". You know, tried to be laddy. And he lent into me and he went IN A LOW VOICE: "You're a dirty dog". AUDIENCE LAUGHS Anyway, Baz and I have been fucking in the attic for a while now. It's been marvellous. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS The reason I mention the off licence is something happened there on the day I got the house. And I still can't get my head around it. I went in to get a celebratory bottle, I thought that would be nice to celebrate buying a house, exciting achievement. In front of me was a lad buying a four-pack of lager beers. IN A BRUM ACCENT: "A few tinnies with the boys watch the game today". And um... I was here. There was a girl-- it wasn't Baz on the till that day-- it was a girl, she was probably about 18, couldn't be much older and she said to the guy, she said "Can I see some ID?" and he went "Fucking hell, for fuck sake, this is fucking ridiculous". And then, had ID! And showed it to her, - AUDIENCE LAUGHS And she looked at it, and she went, "Yep, that's fine" and he paid for it and went out with his beers. And I went up with my bottle of Pinot Blush, I was like.. "He was really full on, wasn't he, like really aggressive and horrible", And she went "He's in here every day and it's always the same". AUDIENCE LAUGHS Time moves in one direction. Cos I've been in my childhood bedroom most of my life I've got now stuff, got no furniture. The amount of aunties and uncles trying to lump shit coffee tables... Mugs, everyone's got a bloody mug to give you! I got a mug from my auntie which has got a motivational quote on it and I hate a motivational quote. The quote is "You've got the same amount of hours in the day as Beyoncé". AUDIENCE LAUGHS But not the resources, Janet! AUDIENCE LAUGHS I showed it to Peter, I said, "That's bollocks, isn't it?" and he went "Yes, so did Rose West, see how that turned out!" I was like... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS That wasn't my issue with the mug but you go for it, darling. I've become a bit obsessed with tat because I'm on my local "sell and swap" Facebook group. If you're not on yours, there will be one in your local area. Have a look at it after the show. What it is, if you're not familiar with the sell and swap concept it's people with nothing to do with their lives trying to sell and swap utter shit that they've found in their houses! There was a woman on there the other day. She wanted to swap these sausages. AUDIENCE LAUGHS She bought some Cauldron vegetarian sausages. She realised they weren't vegan, she wanted to swap them for a bag of fruit e.g. plums. I know what fruit is! AUDIENCE LAUGHS I don't need an example. What is this fruit? Some of the shit you get on here. Wooden snail, right. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Four comments! Who's looking at that, going "I need more information"? "What is that? I don't know what that is". Unusual, unglazed vase. You say unusual. I think someone's wrapped some ham round itself. That's what it looks like to me! This one's... It's a horrible that, isn't it horrible? This one's particularly bat shit, this is um... I'll zoom in on this one. "About 120 adult DVDs. Can easily sell for a pound each so good profit open your boot at work and let the lads dive in". Look at them just on the side, next to the kettle, horrible. Of course I'm trolling this group. Of course I am, with my character Christopher Butterslip. There he is. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS That's a drawing I did of Mickey Flanagan that didn't go very well. Done a lot of good work with Christopher. I'm very proud of the work I've done with Christopher. First thing I did. There was a gitl... She was selling a Jean-Paul Sartre book for £4. She'd used it in her dissertation and she needed it no longer. She put it on the sell and swap. I got in touch as Christopher, I said, "Just out of curiosity could you take a picture of the first page?" And because she had nothing to do with her day within minutes a picture emerged on the group. So then I put, "And now the second page". AUDIENCE LAUGHS I got to five pages before she realised I was trying to read the book through the pictures! AUDIENCE LAUGHS Oh, this one was good fun. "Little Sammy's grown out of his ocean pals". "I've also got about four copies of the Gruffalo". "Looking to swap for something a bit more... grown up." she said. No, some of you are further along here! AUDIENCE LAUGHS I suggested knives and saws. That's what I suggested. AUDIENCE LAUGHS A nice selection of knives and saws. She put "Ha! Not quite what I had in mind". So I thought about it for a little while. Oh, I've got some adult DVDs, let the lads dive in. AUDIENCE LAUGHS My favourite thing I've done on the sell and swap-- it's pathetic this-- I set myself up for a joke. I listed my own thing. I listed a bag of butter mints for £1. Christopher Butterslip, bag of butter mints, £1. Logged out, logged in as me, Joe Lycett. Commented, "What condition are these in?" Logged back out, in a Christopher Butterslip "Mint condition". Very happy with that. AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AND LAUGHS I'm a bell-end, aren't I. Now, guys, I want to tell you about a little project I've been working on for the last year. There's no nice way of saying this, there's no easy way of saying this I'm just gonna have to rip the plaster off. For the last year just under a year... I have been trying to destroy the career of Tom Daley. There's no easy way of saying it. I've said it. It's gone, it's out there now, I've said it. I should caveat this by saying, I think Tom Daley's amazing in lots of ways. He's an Olympic diver, I'm sure you're aware of Tom Daley. He's gay. I think he was pushed into coming out as gay before he was necessarily ready. There was a lot of fuss about it from the gay press and he's been a brilliant gay rights advocate in lots of ways. You might have seen that him and his husband, Lance Black announced a few months ago that they're having a baby together. Shouldn't be a brave thing to do in this day and age, but it was. He got a lot of nastiness and he's been serene throughout the whole thing so I do think he's brilliant. However, I now want to slag him off. So... AUDIENCE LAUGHS Tom Daley irked me last summer for two reasons: two Instagram posts. And I'll show them to you now. This is the first one. This is him at Gay Pride. Love the way that he's extending his arm out there to show the parade march there. Love the look, the smile on his face, beautiful framing there. Before I go into too much detail about this what's going on with the hand? Where is the other finger? I've looked at it loads. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS I don't know if it's a lighting thing, whether it's edited out. I don't know how that happens. I've got no issue with any of that really, apart from the weird finger. I've got no issue with this other post, beautifully framed again. His skin looks radiant in that little triangle, marvellous. Brave to wear a tank top, but he seems to manage it. I think it's wonderful. I've got no issue with any of this, I think it's all brilliant. I've no issue with any of this, as well: "Happy Pride Everyone!" "It's been so awesome to take part in my first ever pride"-- he'd not been before-- "But let's not forget why we have this day and how much more we have to fight for in many other social justice movements around the world". No issue with any of that, brilliant that he went to Pride. I think we all should at some point in our lives it's good fun, if nothing else. My issue with both of these posts is not what's in them, it's what's underneath them. And that is this. That means that Tom Daley was sponsored by Barclays to go to Pride. And I don't have a problem with Tom Daley being sponsored to do lots of things. I understand, when you're an athlete you've gotta make your money while you can. You're not monetisable forever, you might break your leg. I totally get, being sponsored but to be sponsored to go to Pride which is a political event, it made me uncomfortable. It's sort of like going, "Black lives matter, with Tesco". It made me uncomfortable. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS And I didn't want to make a big deal of this. I thought, it's and error in judgement, in some way. Didn't want to make a big fuss about it. All thought I'd do is a bit of light trolling of Tom Daley. That's all I thought I'd do. So what I did is, I went on this very post and I commented on it with hashtags of rival banks. That's all I did. #NatWest - AUDIENCE LAUGHS #Santander #HSBC AUDIENCE CHEERS And for some reason dozens of other people started doing it, as well ! #Northern Rock, a nice nostalgic one! Vietcombank, an international one. Dozens of people did this, and I know that celebrities get paid loads for this. Barclays will have had a PR team all over it. I should mention that I've trolled Tom Daley in a lot lighter way about three years ago. He posted to his Twitter, a little post basically saying "Just take the image below, personalise it". He just wanted you to customise an image in your own way. That's all he wanted you to do. Of course I put him in a smack den. Who wouldn't in my position? Open bloody goal Tom! So that was it, really, as far as I was concerned. I've done my post, other people have commented Point made. It was... I felt an error in judgement, that was it. Next day, I get a phone call. It's from a friend of mine who's a photographer. He's photographed the Olympic diving team on a few occasions, and he's also photographed me. And he said, "Joe, you need to go on Ross Haslam's Instagram". Now, I didn't know who Ross Haslam was at the time He is another British diver who went to Budapest the day after Pride, with Tom Daley for a competition. And he posted a video. The video you don't necessarily need to see, I will show it to you. It's a panoramic of Budapest. It's done... weirdly. It's a portrait thing, but he's done it on landscape which I don't understand. Also... the sound in the background's not great. So I will play it to you twice. But you can hear, in the background, Tom Daley's voice and I just want you to listen out for it. Have a listen to this clearly now. VOICE OF TOM DALEY: Uh, of the whole... uh, the Lycett situation. Now, he might be saying "the lighting situation” but I think Tom Daley says "the Lycett situation”. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Have another listen, just to double check. VOICE OF TOM DALEY: Uh, of the whole... uh, the Lycett situation. Does that sound like "Lycett" to you? I'm a situation. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Not sure who he's talking to in that clip. Presumably, the assassin he's got to take me out! AUDIENCE LAUGHS I like the Lycett situation. I'm gonna write a book: "The Lycett Situation." There's the cover. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I thought, "This has got out of hand, I'm a ‘situation', all of a sudden". I didn't want to be a situation, I just... It was a bit of light trolling, and suddenly I'm a situation. But the more I thought about it, the more I thought "Actually, in this regard, I do want to be a ‘situation' cos I care about this shit". And I'll explain why. Pride is an LGBTQ+ event. There's a lot of letters there, and often Pride and its sponsors only focus on the 'G' - often gay men with six-packs. But there's a lot of other letters there that deserve our attention. For example "T" for "Trans". I've got a lot of trans friends at the minute that feel really attacked, feel really unsafe. They feel really attacked by the right-wing press. They feel more attacked by my mum's friend, Linda. She... oh. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS She's the sort of person who says "A woman's place is in the home" and then spends 90% of her time in All Bar One. AUDIENCE LAUGHS She's a basic bitch. And she... um... She said to me once, she said "Trans people are unnatural" whilst eating a punnet of seedless grapes the irony of which did not pass me by! She had a go at me for painting my nails. I paint my nails now, I do it for two reasons: one, I like the colour. Also, I bite my fingernails because they're delicious. And when I paint them, it stops you from biting them. It's the only thing that seems to have worked. And she said, "You shouldn't do that, you shouldn't paint your nails". And I said, "Why's that, Linda?" and she said "Well, it's an essential part of being a woman isn't it, wearing make-up?" So, I'm sorry, do you think your husband Kevin's gonna see this, get confused and try and fuck me? Is that the issue? AUDIENCE LAUGHS Extraordinary, a little change like that, the amount of comments you got. Of course, I expected some but not as many as I got. I also wear this coat in the winter months, ooh! I' mean I... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS I want to fuck myself right now. That is, um... - SOMEONE WOLF WHISTLES Thank you, yes it's, um... Ooh err, It's a faux fur. It's a faux fur. I'm aware it's a ridiculous thing to put on. But I didn't expect the amount of comments. I expected some. My favourite was in Liverpool. I'd just done a gig at the Slaughter House comedy club which is a brilliant comedy club in Liverpool. I was walking back to the hotel. A group of lads walked past me and one of them went IN SCOUSE ACCENT: Hey mate, Pat Butcher called. She wants her coat back. AUDIENCE LAUGHS And I'm a comedian, I deal with hecklers all the time. So I went back with a really witty response, I went "Sh-sh-shut up, you stupid prick". I was so pleased with it, $0 smug, so in the moment. Well done, Joe. I think, what Linda, and what a lot of people get confused about with with trans people, is the difference between sex and gender. Sex is your XX, XY chromosome that's what you're born with, not lots you can do about it. Gender is what is put on top by society and culture. All of the things we take for granted, things like women wear skirts and men ride horses and punch dogs. All of the things we take for granted. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS And I understand that women get the thick end of this wedge. The narrow criteria in which women are expected to dress and behave is very restrictive. This was made clear to me in a Whatsapp group of lads that I'm in in which this was posted recently. IN MACHO VOICE: This is "Build a Babe." You have to construct a woman out of these four categories. INA MACHO VOICE: The face, the boobs, the butt, the legs. No, "the personality" or... IN A MANIC VOICE: "How much she reminds you of mother". None of that! AUDIENCE LAUGHS This was debated more than most wars! They went with the girl second in, I think. The two girls on the far right for the boobs and bum and then the girl, second in on the legs. I did a bit of photoshopping - yeah, she's pretty fit. I mean, not my type. I'd change one thing and I'd be happy. But each to their own. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS It's quite daunting that size. So, it's LGBTQ+ if you're interested. That's "Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans, Queer" and then the "plus" is for all of the other letters and there can be as many letters as there are people in the world. Some of the more popular ones are "a-sexual", "Gender fluid". That's where you don't see your gender as a fixed thing it can be different things at different times. I was explaining that to Peter on one occasion and he was like "Yeah, I know what gender fluid is but the name ‘gender fluid' you can imagine what it smells like". AUDIENCE LAUGHS Fair enough. "Gosh I had a heavy night". "Was covered in gender fluid in the morning, I was!" AUDIENCE LAUGHS Uh, there's "I" for "intersex". That doesn't mean INA MACHO VOICE: "Uh, yeah, I'm into sex". I don't know what that is, that's like... that's my intersex leg. Um... There's "P" for "pansexual”, which is how I now define myself. It doesn't mean that I fuck things in the kitchen as Linda amusingly observed. IN A MANIC VOICE: "Non-stick surface?" "Not when I'm around, Linda!" "Pan" means different things to different people. To me, it's a form of bi-sexuality. I acknowledge that gender plays a role in why I'm attracted to people but not necessarily the essential role. There's all sorts of common threads in our sexualities that we wouldn't otherwise acknowledge. You might only be attracted to blonde people. But you wouldn't say you were "blond sexual" but that would be a common thread. I think the common thread in my sexuality is everyone I'm attracted to is not attracted to me. That seems to be the common thread. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Sometimes it not really about how they look or their gender or anything. It's sort of more to do with how they hold themselves or how they, sort of, take control of a situation. I explained this to Linda in a very ham-fisted way. I was in Moseley post office, in Birmingham, if you know Birmingham. There's two tills. There's one here, there's one here. On this till was a very young, very loud, very attractive, young, effervescent girl. She was wearing a Cath Kidston coat, she was going off like a human Berocca. She was annoying! She sort of... The sort of girl who as "live, laugh, love" written in her living room but has also been done for GBH. Do you know what? She's... an annoying person here. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS And then here was a really elderly, octogenarian crunched-over old woman quite poor-looking, sort of Mary Berry if she didn't have money. Just sort of crunched over like that and she was going... “I'm... I'm sorry I can't hear you". She kept saying that, "I'm sorry, I can't hear you". And in the end she went "I can't hear you... HE SHOUTS: ...because you're shrieking!" And I said to Linda, I said "I don't know what it was but in that moment, the way she took control of that situation the way she extinguished all of this woman's joy the way everyone was looking at her I thought she was so attractive, $0 beautiful. Obviously, I wouldn't do anything about it. And Linda was like, "Oh, what, are you ageist?" I was like, "No I wouldn't do anything about it cos she's poor! But the point is... - AUDIENCE LAUGHS There's all sorts of new identities flying around at the minute. New ways to describe yourself, and I think that's wonderful. But you've got two options when you encounter someone with an identity that you're not familiar with. You can be fearful of them, frightened, take the piss out of them or be fascinated, ask them loads of questions, be curious. Kinda like when [ first saw a platypus. I think they're amazing. They're mammals they lay eggs, what the fuck are they? The first platypus that scientists found... They found a dead one. They did some scientific tests. Their conclusion: it's a fake. They thought that someone had sewn together a duck and an otter. Begs the question: who did they think was doing this? "Oh, that's Martin. He loves doing that, Martin". "Other day he brought this in, said it was a porpoise - obviously a dolphin and a bell end". "Classic Martin, that". - AUDIENCE LAUGHS So by Pride only sponsoring one of the letters and ignoring the other letters I felt like they'd done a disservice to the community so I wrote them a letter. "Dear Barclays You probably know why I'm writing, you bitch". AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND CLAPS "You sponsored Tom Daley to go to Pride, daft bastard". AUDIENCE LAUGHS "Actually it's great that you're sponsoring Pride. Pride is an LGBTQ+ event. It's about celebrating all of those letters and all the different types of identity that they represent. It's about people who are into kinky stuff. It's about some stuff that a lot of the people who work in your bank would find really weird. It's not just about a particularly attractive gay diver who you can use to improve the perception of your brand. So I'm writing to ask if you'll sponsor me. Not to go to Pride, but to one of the less air-brushed events. I want you to sponsor me and my friend Paul Chuckle to go to the Folsom Fetish Festival in Berlin, It's a festival for people who are into leather and being tied up and wearing costumes. I went a couple of years ago and nearly got wanked off by a unicorn". AUDIENCE LAUGHS "I've mocked up a sample Instagram post. Naturally, the real thing will look much worse. Bob's your uncle, Joe Lycett". Now... - AUDIENCE CLAPS AND CHEERS Bless you. That... That pasty photo came in handy as you can see. Very useful there. Not had a reply from Barclays. Um, I did send them another thing. I sent them a painting I did of Tom Daley. I'm not thrilled with it because I don't think it looks like Tom Daley. But I fucking nailed that hand, didn't I? AUDIENCE LAUGH Just out of curiosity, you don't have to cheer if you don't want to. Um, but give me a cheer if you consider yourself part of the LGBTQ+ community. AUDIENCE CHEERS LOUDLY - Oh, cool. Welcome. - WOMAN: Yeah! AUDIENCE LAUGHS - The rest of you should leave. AUDIENCE LAUGHS - Bless you, thanks for coming. Lets talk about another bank that I'm in trouble with. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I'm actually in proper trouble with this bank. This is the Royal Bank of Scotland. I'm in... Right, so Peter worked not for RBS, he worked in an RBS building in Pigeon Park in Birmingham, if you know it. He was working in an office space in this building. And um... I went into that office with him last summer. And, as a result of that, he had to write a letter of apology to the manager of the building a few days later. And I'll just read to you that letter, He wrote: "Dear Sir I am writing to explain the incident in your office and offer my sincere apologies for any involvement on my part. I invited a guest to the building to show them a project we had been working on and benefit from his expertise". What had actually happened was we were on the piss and he had a bottle of wine under his desk. AUDIENCE LAUGHS "At security he was asked to enter his name for a guest pass. I did not see what he typed because I was dealing with some emails on my phone." Uh, they get you to type in your name on a fancy touch screen as you go into the RBS building. I didn't want to do that, I was feeling silly so what I did is I just typed in the first two words that came to mind. Which happened to be "rhubarb bikini". I don't know why. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS "There was a short discussion between my guest and the security guard". This is where the security guard quite rightly said "What's that?" and I said "It's pronounced 'Ryan'..." AUDIENCE LAUGHS And he said, "It's spelt 'rhubarb'..." and I said, "Yes, it's Irish". AUDIENCE LAUGHS "Then a pass was printed and we were allowed into the building". Here is that pass. AUDIENCE LAUGHS "Subsequently an image of the pass appeared on social media". I put that on Instagram with the caption "Someone broke into RBS with the pseudonym, Rhubarb Bikini". "The minute I discovered this, I asked for the image to be removed but I appreciate by that point damage had been done to the reputation of the business". It got about 10,000 likes. "I offer a full and sincere apology for this, regards, Peter". He was taken in for a disciplinary a few days after we did this. They slid this pass over to him and said "Do you know this man?" I just love the idea of him going IN ASILLY VOICE: "That's Rhubarb Bikini!" AUDIENCE LAUGHS A few weeks later, I received this letter to my home address in the name of Colonel Rhubarb Bikini. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Full disclosure, that's because I have opened an account with RBS in the name of Rhubarb Bikini. Here's me opening the account. Colonel, I went with Colonel because I thought that was funny. Are you known by any other name? N0000000000. Born in North Korea, living with parents. He's lived a life! He's lived a life, old Rhubarb. They ask you to fill out a form when you've opened an RBS account to say, "Is the anything else that would have made your application experience better, today?" I've thought about that long and hard, and I put "Yeah..." "A hand job would have done it, actually". A little hand job would have taken the edge off, really. He rang me, he said "Joe, we're in a lot of trouble". I was like, "What do you mean?" He said "I've just had this disciplinary". "I've been banned from the office for two months", And I said, "I'm so..." I was really shocked, "I'm so sorry, what an overreaction". "Like, it's just a silly joke". And he said, "Oh, I don't really mind". "I don't like working there s0 I'm happy to have the time off". And he said, "You're in proper trouble". I was like, "What do you mean?" And he said "Well, because you said ‘someone' broke into RBS on the Instagram post they can't pin it on you, the picture's quite blurry. So they're going back through all the CCTV footage to see what we did in there. We were in there for eight minutes, apparently, we were giggling in the lift. Um, I can believe it. He said they're going back through all your social media to see if you are a threat to the business. If you've done something like this before, whether you're likely to do it again. I was like, "What do you mean, they're going through all my social media?" He's like, "Your Instagram, your Twitter, everything they're going through everything". And I thought, "Oh my God, they're going through everything, so..." They will have seen that picture of me pretending to be a vomiting cat. AUDIENCE LAUGHS They would have seen that picture of an egg that I put Iggy Azalea's face on and called it "Eggy Azalea". - AUDIENCE LAUGHS God, they will have seen that tweet which I did which was "I like my sex like I like my Brexit - hard and overseen by Theresa May". AUDIENCE LAUGHS God, they will have seen all the times I dressed up as Theresa May using things that were just near by. I've done loads of these, she's a style icon, this woman. She's a style icon. Right... Take this one, and this is the original. An extraordinary photo in its own right. This is my version. Right, the neck is a chorizo. The woman's face is a sculpture that I made. The earing is a courgette. Strong work from Joe Lycett all round. I said... "Oh my God, they will have seen that sign that I posted" which reads "This seating area is for customers of Costa Coffee only." Which I sent direct to Costa Coffee with the caption "Just sat here and drank a cafe nero and there's shit all you can do about it". AUDIENCE LAUGHS I said, "Oh, my God, they will have seen that time when I was on the Lorraine Kelly show and gave Lorraine a quiche Lorraine". She was very confused. I said, "Oh my God, they will have seen those tweets which I did" which started with... "I love The Saturdays". "Hard to choose my favourite, but I'd probably say 17th May, 2003". Which I followed up with "I love One Direction". "Hard to choose a favourite but I'd probably say 'left'..." AUDIENCE LAUGHS I said, "Oh, my God, they will have seen that picture of Jeremy Corbyn that I put on a bin in my car and called it "Jeremy Car-bin'..." AUDIENCE LAUGHS They will have seen that tweet which I did, which was "I like my women how I like my coffee". "Nowhere near my penis". AUDIENCE LAUGHS And I suppose, if they're looking into the future they're about to see a painting I'm gonna do of the man that runs your building. Cos I've done some googling, and I know what he looks like. And it's just him in the office saying "No". “I'm Rhubarb Bikini", - AUDIENCE LAUGHS You have been an extraordinary audience. AUDIENCE SHOUT AND CHEER OK. Right, I'm... So, I obviously wasn't done with RBS, of course I wasn't. I felt like what they'd done was an attack on fun... and on silliness I felt like, um... There are people that work in that building that want to be daft and silly at points in their lives and they have to extinguish that desire in the name of security and corporate rules and I felt that was sad. So I got the email address of the man that runs the building from Peter, and I set up a Rhubarb Bikini email account and I sent him an email. It read, "To the Manager". "I am Rhubarb Bikini..." AUDIENCE LAUGHS "And I gather you are looking for me. You have been led to believe that I am the comedian, Joe Lycett but this is not accurate. For I am at once, all things and no things..." AUDIENCE LAUGHS -" am a whisper in a dream. I am a homeless man in search of a manual for a Fiat Punto..." AUDIENCE LAUGHS "I am Tom Daley's missing finger..." AUDIENCE LAUGHS - "I am a lightbulb in my kitchen. I am a glory hole in a glass door..." AUDIENCE LAUGHS “l am a seller of adult DVDs..." AUDIENCE LAUGHS "I am a master painter". “l am an online troll". AUDIENCE LAUGHS "And I am Children's TV entertainer, Paul Chuckle". Right. - AUDIENCE LAUGHS Good old Paul. I asked for one of these, he sent dozens! AUDIENCE LAUGHS "I am all the colours in the rainbow. I am near and I am far, I'm everyone you'll ever know, I am each pound in the jar. You can never stop me for I will always be. Your staff will never show you, $0 you will never see. But in each of them is nonsense, I know this to be true. So all your staff are Rhubarb and Rhubarb Bikini is you". I also put "P.S. I'm also Alexa". AUDIENCE LAUGHS VOICE OF ALEXA: I'm Rhubarb Bikini and you should suck a dog's cock. AUDIENCE LAUGHS - Thank you so much for coming to my show. Have a great rest of your weekend and lives, thank you so much. AUDIENCE CHEER AND WHISTLE Bless you guys. It's so lovely. Lovely. Thank you, this has been... Yeah, as I say, lovely. Any questions, any queries, any concerns? AUDIENCE LAUGHS - Anything I can help anyone else with? No, OK, right, I'll fuck off then. AUDIENCE LAUGHS - You've been so lovely. Um, you know what? I'd like to slag off the Black Country before I go. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Anyone in from the Black Country? AUDIENCE MEMBERS CHEER Which part? Where are you from? - WOMAN: Wolverhampton. IN BLACK COUNTRY ACCENT: Wolverhampton, alright. How are you, bab? That's how they talk, if you don't know the Black Country, they talk like... They talk like that, "I got no neck and no future". I love it. Have you travelled from Wolverhampton? WOMAN: No, I live in London now. IN BLACK COUNTRY ACCENT: I live in London now. I love it. I really find it pleasing to hear the accent. Have you been to the Ikea in Wednesbury? WOMAN: I have, but I've never purchased anything. Right, why? Because it's too stressful when you get to the checkouts. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Itis stressful when you get to the checkout, I agree. Well, it's stressful in that one because its full of people from the Black Country and they're all mad-heads. You see, I was in the kitchen area when I went round and there was a family walking round and the dad of the family said this very loudly, because I wasn't that nearby and I heard it very clearly. He went "Look at that chopping board I couldn't chop my cock on that!" AUDIENCE LAUGHS Is that a requirement of a chopping board that I've missed? Bless you, well thanks for coming along. I did... This is the thing, I slag off the Black Country loads but it's because I love it and I've got loads of friends there. I spend a lot of time there. I went on a speed awareness course in the Black Country. Have people been on speed awareness courses? AUDIENCE WHOOPS - Yes, some other bad boys. Um, I thought it was really effective. But my favourite thing about it is this woman at the back who just did not give a shit. She's like my new spitit animal, she was just there, like IN BLACK COUNTRY ACCENT: "Alright?" And the guy came out and he was proper patronising, like "Guys, guys, just shout out reasons, why do we speed? Why do we speed?" And she went IN BLACK COUNTRY ACCENT: "Cos I'm in a rush", AUDIENCE LAUGHS And he went, "Good, good, you're in a rush, great, great". "Why do we rush, why do we rush, why do we rush?" IN BLACK COUNTRY ACCENT: "Cos I need a piss". AUDIENCE LAUGHS He realised very quickly, he did not want to be talking to her. He was trying to get anyone else to chip in. At one point he forced this quite meek guy at the front to chip in. It was really sweet. He said "You've got two options, haven't you? You've got two options". "You can go by the speed limit or you can go to jail". "Do you want to go to jail?" He hadn't been listening, he just went "Yes". AUDIENCE LAUGHS "Any reasons why it's justifiable to speed? Why we might be OK to speed?". She went IN BLACK COUNTRY ACCENT: "Well, if it's an emergency". "If you've got to take someone to hospital". He went, "No, that's not a reason is it? It's not a reason". "You've still got to be safe, haven't you? Still got to be safe", "If you hit someone on the way to hospital that's two people going to hospital isn't it?", she went IN BLACK COUNTRY ACCENT: "That's lucky I'm going that way". "I'll give 'em a lift", - AUDIENCE LAUGHS That's lovely, that is. Favourite thing she said, I'll leave you on this. It was terrible, but it was brilliant. He said at the end of the session, he was like "Any other reasons why we speed, that we've not covered? Any other reasons?" No one chipping in. I wasn't chipping in. In the end, she just went IN BLACK COUNTRY ACCENT: "Well, cos it's fun!" AUDIENCE LAUGHS And he went, "Yeah". "Yeah, it's fun isn't it, it's fun to speed". "Do you know when it's not fun?" "When you kill a child", AUDIENCE LAUGHS Everyone went quiet, and then she just went IN BLACK COUNTRY ACCENT: "Depends on the child". AUDIENCE LAUGHS - Love. Her. You've been amazing, wow. Thanks so much. See you again, ta-ra.
