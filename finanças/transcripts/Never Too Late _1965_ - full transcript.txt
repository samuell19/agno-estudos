We'll stop right here. Let's go down. Hey, bud. You see that? Land right in the middle. My. Well, that's the way the order came through, Mr. Lambert. What did you say? I said that's the way the order came through. All I did was catch it before it got to shipping. That son-in-law of mine is still trying to bankrupt me. Charlie! Charlie! [stomps feet] Charlie! Charlie! 'Get yourself up here!' Uh, before you yell, I wanna talk to you. Before I yell, I'll do the talking. Well, the mayor's helicopter is just landing and maybe the mayor is in it, and maybe he wants to give us some business with the city. That will be the day. You know how he hates me. A lot of people hate you. What's that got to do with it? Look, if the city needs lumber, it might as well be ours. Just what do you mean by a lot of people hate me, huh? I didn't say I know for sure. Well, I know one thing for sure, you don't know anything! And what's the idea of giving Paul Weaver special prices like these, huh? These are just odd cuts and sizes. But you ought to be happy just to be rid of it. I'm not in business to be happy. I'm in business for profit. Now cancel this shipment! Look, dad.. Thanks a lot. Look, dad, I thought this order out very carefully. Now that-that lumber's been taking up nothing but space. Yes, well, I've got a head on my shoulders too. Don't tell me about space. M-Mr. Lambert, do you want these to go out this morning? Yeah, I guess so. - How many stamps do you need? - Six. [helicopter whirring] - Here. - Thank you. - Take good care of Phil there. - Yes, sir, Mr. Lambert. [helicopter whirring] Hello, Harry. My good friend and next-door neighbor, Harry Lambert. - Hiya, Charlie. - Hiya, mayor. What's the honor this time? You remember Fred Ainsley, our city engineer. - Ainsley. - Lambert. Uh, you know, Fred, it has been reported that there's very little love lost between old Lambert and me. But we know better, don't we, Harry? Yeah, it's all lost. [laughing] I got his goat eight years ago when he ran against me for mayor. I've had it ever since. - I remember that election. - Oh, I won by a landslide. You won by a dozen votes. - No, no, no, no, 126. - Well, it was under a gross. Now I'm not here to remind you of unpleasant events. Quite the contrary. Go ahead, Fred. You tell him. We've been surveying for months, Mr. Lambert and we've just about locked in the site for the new Calverton football field. Ah! You get that, Harry? Football fields take lumber. All those bleachers. Lots of lumber. - Yeah, I realize that. - Football field? That's about a million board feet. Oh, at least. Of course, our town has two fine lumberyards yours and Cooper's. Of course, Cooper's is a lot more modern. However, the decision as to who gets the contract is up to the city council which I, as mayor, head, of course. [chuckles] Just keep that in mind, Harry, huh? Alright! Oh, good, good to see you again, Mr. Lambert. - You, too, mister, uh, uh-- - We haven't met yet. Oh. [male #1] 'I'll keep you in touch, Lambert.' Yeah, do that. What a contract! Million board feet! Well, I still think it's a possibility. You do, huh? Well, if he doesn't aggravate me to death, you will! That's the possibility! 74, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80 81, 82, 83, 84, 85 86, 87, 88, 89, 90 91, 92, 93, 94, 95 96, 97, 98, 99, 500. - Phew! - Alright, you're the doctor. - Take my pulse. - You are kidding. No, no, no. Go ahead, take it. - Alright. - Hurry up. I'll take it. Pretty good for my age, huh? Harry, it's not only good, it's remarkable. - What are you trying to prove? - My point. The younger generation today are nothing but weaklings. - Now take Charlie, for example. - Harry, the younger gener-- Edith. Edith, can I help you? No, thank you, Grace. I'll be with you in a moment. Just sit and enjoy yourself. Harry, doesn't Edith look a little tired? She goes to bed early every night. Uh, I don't mean tired from lack of sleep. I mean, this house. It's awfully big for her to take care of. Why, this house is her pride and joy. They don't build houses like this anymore, you know? Granite foundation. Copper pipes. Edith doesn't have a granite foundation or copper pipes. Why don't you two go on a vacation? And just who is going to look after the business? - Well, what about Charlie? - He'd ruin me in two weeks. Take a one week's vacation. Harry, there is nothing wrong with Charlie. You just haven't given him a chance. I've given him everything. A job the day he married Kate. No rent to pay. A nice home here with me. Mom! Mo.. Oh, hi, everybody. - Hey, mom! - Yes, Charles? Mom, Kate wants to know if you pressed her dress. Oh, i-i-it's hanging in the kitchen, dear. - I'll get it. - 'Okay.' [Charlie] 'Uh, oh, oh, uh, mom?' You wouldn't happen to be doing a wash today, would you? - Well-- - We're closed on Sundays! [imitating Harry] We're closed on Sundays. Gets his laundry free, his meals free. They ought to have a home of their own. They say they're saving up for one. I don't know how long it'll take 'em on the money he makes. [Edith] 'Kate!' Oh, Kate dear, I have your dress. Oh, thank you, mother. Mom, would be a doll and get me the fishing boots that Charlie borrowed from Jim West? - Where are they? - They're in the cellar. At the bottom of the stairs. Wouldn't be too much trouble for you? - No, no, dear. I'll get 'em. - Thank you. I'd swear she was on roller skates. What time you got? Uh, 3 o'clock. I've gotta be on my way. Grace, I'll pick you up on the way back from the clinic. Alright, dear. Don't wear yourself out, Harry. Oh, I'll walk you to your car. - How be ya, doc? - Hi, mayor! Hey, doc, don't make any U-turn. You'll be right up on my lawn. Section 214-B of the criminal code private property. [laughs] He's about as funny as choking to death. [laughs] Hey, doc, don't take any wooden aspirins. [laughing] So long, Jim. Those are the jokes, Harry boy. [laughs] Oh, oh, Harry, I hate to trouble you, dear but I think there's something wrong with the hot water boiler. Huh? That's impossible. You couldn't buy a better boiler. Solid copper through and through. [Charlie] Hey! What's the matter with the hot water? It's cold. The hot water in this house isn't cold! I'll tell you something, it's not hot either. There's nothing wrong with the boiler! Just doesn't work, Charles. Edith, that boiler was made to last a lifetime. Maybe its lifetime is over? [chuckles] Something wrong with the boiler. It's worked perfectly for 22 years! Charles, Charles, here are your boots, dear. [Charlie] 'Thanks, mom!' Edith, will you, please, finally sit down? I wanna talk to you. And I want so much to talk to you, Grace. Just one little moment. Now what are you doing? Don't wanna forget Harry's button. Edith, you're gonna have to put your foot down about all this housework. It's too much. - Get a maid. - A maid? You know how Harry feels about maids. He likes absolute privacy in his own home. A man's entitled to that. A man's only entitled to what he can get away with. Tsk. Oh, Grace. How often does Harry take you out to dinner? You know how Harry feels about restaurants. Besides, he just loves my cooking. Do you know he still comes home for lunch? I guess that proves something. It sure does. [metal clanking] What's that? It's probably Harry trying to get the hot water boiler fixed. [metal clanking] And from the sound of it, he's enjoying himself. [chuckles] What's all the noise, mom? [Edith] 'It's Harry trying to get the water hot.' [chuckles] - Well, how do I look, ladies? - Simply delicious. - Thank you. - That's my girl. - Hello, Grace. - Hello, dear. What happened to my blowtorch? You heard me. I said what happened to my blowtorch? - Doesn't that work either? - Of course, it works. You couldn't buy a better blowtorch. I wanna know where it is, that's what I wanna know. [chuckles] What are you trying to do, dad? Heat the water with a blowtorch? [laughing] Excuse me. It wouldn't hurt, you know, if you gave me some help. I'd like to help you, dad, I just don't know anything about a hot water boiler. Neither do I. But it doesn't stop me from fixing it. Well, did you get it fixed? Yes, I just didn't get the pipes and things back together. Dear, I'm sure Charles would be more than glad to help you but he and Kate have a social engagement. Again? Don't you two ever stay home? We're home all week, dad. - At least I am. - I never see you. I haven't seen you at the breakfast table in five years. I don't eat breakfast and I don't see any sense in getting up for breakfast if I don't eat any. - Kate eats lunch. - 'Thank you, mother.' What you mean is, she eats breakfast but she doesn't get up until it's time for lunch. Well, we gotta get goin'. Goodbye, Grace, mom. - Goodbye, Grace. - See you later. - Bye, mom. - Bye, dear. - Goodbye, dad. - You know what you two need? Responsibility. It's time you settled down and started raising a family. Please, dad, let's not go into that again, okay? We're just not ready for a family yet. What does it take to get ready, huh? Just make up your mind and sit down and do it. Father! Let's go, honey, let's, um-- Oh. Mother, I don't know about your husband. It's a little embarrassing, you know that? I mean, just because you.. ...can't find your blowtorch. Just no home life anymore. Everybody's in a rush to go somewhere. The important thing is that they seem happy. And that's what counts. Of course, they're happy, they've got me. I make them happy. That's true, Harry dear. You do cause a lot of happiness. You're darn right. Now why don't you go look for your blowtorch? You'll feel better when you find it. Trouble with the kids today, they don't appreciate. Ungrateful. Wish I had a father like me when I was their age. - 'But you did, dear.' - Don't remind me. You know, Edith, he really believes every word he says. That's one of his most endearing traits. Endearing? That's the word for it, alright. Oh, my goodness. Charles completely forgot his fishing boots. - Edith. - That's funny. Well, come and sit down. That's the third dizzy spell I've had this week. I suppose I should go and see James at his office. I just can't believe it! Have you told Edith? Not yet, dear. That's why I wanted you here. I thought it might make it easier for her. Oh, it's, it's crazy. Just crazy. Maybe you should send her to a specialist. Oh, I-I know, dear, you know best and everything-- Never mind. Uh, the tests were made at the laboratory. They are specialists. There's no question about it. She's pregnant. Edith's beginning her second month. But it just doesn't seem possible. Wait a minute. James, Dr. Turner had a hygienist. Her last name was Lamb. Maybe her first name was Edith. Well, Edith Lamb, Edith Lambert, get it? They don't make those mistakes at the lab, Grace. Only in the movies. Besides, her name was Sonja. I, I just can't believe it. Edith, at her age. And Harry.. Harry? That old son of a gun. - Hello, James. - Hello, Edith. - Hello, Edith. - Grace! [dramatic music] Have a nice day, Mrs. Lambert. [instrumental music] [upbeat music] [instrumental music] Dad, will you quit pacing? Just sit down. Doesn't it bother you that your mother isn't home yet? Have you ever known her to stay out this late before? [Charlie] 'Well, if you're that worried, dad' 'why don't you call the police?' - Yeah. - Oh, boy, that's a bright idea. And what makes you think she's mixed up with the police? Oh, no. Charlie didn't say she was mixed up with the police. No, I just thought that if she's lost the police might be able to help find her, that's all. And you'd like to see it in the newspaper and everything, huh? Oh, who said he wants to see it in the newspaper? I don't even know what the heck she's done. Who said she'd done anything? Oh, forget it. I don't know what you're so concerned about. You wouldn't. Mom has identification, hasn't she? - 'Yes.' - Alright. She has a birthmark. Is her address on it? Who the hell ever heard of an address on a birthmark? [laughs] I was thinking of something else. You're an idiot. I take exception to that! Is this the showdown? - You'd like it to be-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would-- Now, look, you two, stop all this nonsense-- [incoherent clamoring] Well? - 'Do you like it?' - Mom! Mother. Edith? Is that all anybody has to say? What have you done to yourself? Have you forgotten you have a family? Where have you been? Oh, I'm sorry. Well, in all the excitement, I, I guess I didn't realize. - Is it late? - Is it late? - Where's dinner? - Dinner-- Oh, dad. Come on, mother. Sit down. Let's talk. Come on, mom, tell us all about it. I certainly have a lot to tell you. - All of you. - Where's your hair? - Harry Lambert. - It's gone. I can see. No, it's shorter, that's all. It's shorter. A-a-and it's curled at the ends. I had a permanent, a facial and a manicure. The girls said they gave me the works. You've always been a plain, simple, little woman. 'Now look at you.' I think you look absolutely gorgeous, mother. - You're beautiful, mom. - Thank you, dear. Uh, as a matter of fact, Harry, I spent almost two weeks' food allowance on this. Edith, you sit right where you are. I'm gonna put in a little call to the doctor. But, but, Harry, you don't have to call him. I mean, I just came from there. From Jim's office? What were you doing there? Mother, are you alright? Mom, you never looked better. I'm fine. And I never felt better. I want you to sit down nicely while I tell you what I'm going to have to tell you. - Well, go ahead. - Oh, sit down, dad. Alright, we're all sitting down nicely. Now tell us. [sighs] It's alright, mother. Now we're all listening. - Aren't we? - I'm listening. [clears throat] We're your family and we love you. Oh, I was counting on that. Well, I guess I should start from the very beginning. Alright. You start any way you want, mother. Maybe not from the very beginning. Perhaps the middle. Alright, start from the middle, but start. I'd like to hear it from the beginning. If you don't know what she's talking about how do you know you'd like to hear from the beginning? Well, I just thought that-- Would you two mind letting mother talk, hm? Now you start from the middle, mother. Mm, I'd really rather start from the end and get it over with, but, um.. Mom, would it help you if we try to guess? You know, maybe if you gave us a little hint. We're not playing parlor games! We're trying to get some information. Well, we're not getting any information this way! I think it's a pretty good suggestion if it will help. Just like all the rest of your suggestions. If I'd have listened to your suggestions out at the lumberyard, I'd have been broke the first year you were here. That happens to be one man's opinion. Are you trying to tell me I don't know my own business? - Oh, will you two, please-- - I'm going to have a baby. I won't stop what I didn't start. Now answer me! Are you trying to tell me I don't know my own business? I didn't say that, but other people can be right, too, you know. - 'You, for instance?' - I'm going to have a baby. Would you both mind letting mother say what she's got to say? Now you keep out of this, Edith. I'm going to settle this thing once and for all.. Uh, uh.. Wh, what did you say, Edith? I said I'm going to have a baby. There. Mother. Wow. Now you know. Father, how could you? 'How could you?' [sobbing] Now look here.. [Kate crying] And I think that's a pretty underhanded trick. Trick? Trick? You've been throwing everything else in my face. Now I suppose it will be the baby. Now look here! Now, now, Charles, nobody's going to throw the baby in your face, dear. And I want you to promise Charles that now. I don't have to promise him anything! Something's out of control here, Edith and I'm going to get to the bottom of-- No, no, no, Harry, you're raising your voice. That's just the sort of thing that's likely to make me faint. You faint. [sobs] You seem to forget what condition my mother is in. Oh, mother. There, there, dear. Remember how you always said you wanted a little brother? Yes, but that was 20 years ago. Well, your wish has finally come true. To hell with her wishes. What about mine? Honey. Honey, please, don't cry. Ooh, don't you touch me! All men are horrible! I had nothing to do with this! Have you any idea what you're saying? Huh? And, you, stop crying. If anybody should cry around here, it should be me. Edith, are you sure they're not confusing yourself with another woman in Jim's office? A young woman with a nice young husband? Well, that's what Grace thought, too, but James said no. 'Labs don't make mistakes. Only in the movies.' What have I done? I've lived a good life. I've worked hard. Don't smoke much. Don't drink or gamble. That's true, dad. You have very few vices. As a matter of fact, I didn't even think.. Oh. I think the time has come and we should discuss something else. - What's that, dear? - A maid. - A what? - A maid. It's obvious mother's not gonna be able to do the real work around here, so you-- So you'll do it! Me? I-I can't even cook. You learned to eat, didn't you? And you've never lifted a finger around this house and I think it's about time! Oh, Harry, it's no chore for me to get the dinner. Edith, I don't want you interfering. You're no longer unemployed. Alright, father, I'll do it. You'll see. I'll do everything. I'll become a slave if that's what you want. A slave! That's more like it. I'll call when dinner is ready. Whatever it is. Well.. ...I guess I better give her a hand. You know, it being her first time and all. [chuckles] I thought everyone would be so happy. Well, we are happy, Edith. But there's all kinds of happiness. This happens to be the kind of happiness that-that, that.. ...well, everybody isn't so happy about. I guess it was silly of me, but I don't know. After James told me the news for a while there, I just felt young again. I can take the hat back if you want me to, Harry. Keep it. Then you like it? Keep it, anyway. I won't wear it if you don't like it. Alright, keep it, but don't wear it. You know, Harry.. ...if you look at it right this is a fine and noble thing we're doing. We're giving life to a brand-new little human being. A baby. Isn't that beautiful? Why don't you try to look at it that way, dear? Try. I'm trying. Well, can you see it that way now? I'm still trying. Well, then look at it this way. You've always wanted a son and now you might have one. Isn't that a nice thought? Edith, the one thought that keeps going through my mind is that when he gets out of college I'll be going on 83. - If he's smart. - Oh. Of course, he'll be smart, dear. Your son, he'll take after you. He'll have your nice eyes, your brains the curly hair you used to have. Oh, it makes one believe in miracles. Don't you think it makes one believe in miracles, Harry? You'd never have thought it possible, would you? You can be sure of that, Edith. And yet it's true. Harry, how does that poem go? "I shot an arrow into the air." [rooster crowing] [instrumental music] Coochie, coochie, coochie. Daddy, daddy, daddy! [bones crack] [groaning] Ooh! H-hi, son. Break, one, two, three, four! [groans] [organ music] "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God "to join together in the bonds of holy matrimony '"this man and this woman.' '"They stand before their friends' '"facing a blossomed life.' 'As they join their hands, they will vow.."' [cars honking] Mornin', Mr. Lambert. How's the old tiger today? [male #2] 'Hiya, Mr. Lambert.' You're looking mighty spry, Mr. Lambert! Hi, boss. Fit as a fiddle and ready for love today? [male #3] 'What's new, pussycat?' I'll pay you back after today's work. Hiya, Louie. A full 500 feet of six quarter-log.. Good morning, Mr. Lambert. - Send it over to Mrs. Jensen. - Okay. Boy, has she been hollerin' and hollerin' and hollerin'? - Oh, good morning. - It is, huh? Did you tell anybody around here that I was going to have a baby, huh? Me? Why would I do a thing like that? Excuse me, Mr. Lambert, would you mind putting your Johnny Hancock on this, please? Of course, Bobby. Oh, uh, how's Mrs. Lambert feeling today? Okay? Of course, Mrs. Lambert is feeling okay. I'm just asking, Mr. Lambert, that's all. I'm just asking. Don't look at me. People were bound to find out, weren't they? How? Oh, a person can't have a secret baby. I'm not trying to have a secret baby. I just don't need you or anybody else for publicity purposes, that's all. It's nobody's damn business. But you can't keep it a secret. You've gotta register it or something, don't you? Did I say I wasn't going to register my own baby, huh? I just want it kept quiet. It's not normal to have a baby without people knowing about it. As a matter of fact, I don't even think it's legal. Are you standing here telling me I'm trying to have an illegal baby, huh? No, no, no, no, I didn't say that. Then keep your nose out of the baby completely! I have already. Besides, he didn't say he knew about the baby. You know something? I think it's all in your imagination. [Harry] 'Oh, it's my imagination? I guess I'm going crazy, huh?' [Charlie] I didn't say that, but you do have an imagination! Oh, yeah, you're completely innocent! - Completely! - You had nothing to do with it! [Charlie] 'That's right.' 'I don't know anything about it.' - 'Oh, you don't?' - 'No.' [Harry] 'Oh, you're the picture of innocence.' - 'No, I didn't say that.' - 'Butter wouldn't melt in--' - 'Oh, yes, it would.' - 'Oh, I know you, boy.' - What? - Yap, yap, yap, yap-- You're loud, loud, loud, loud, loud! Yeah, yeah, that's you. Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it? - It's absolutely stunning. - And this. I know it's silly, but I just adore it. Then it's not silly. Just think what fun you're going to have shopping for maternity clothes. Grace, am I showing at all? Honey, it isn't six weeks yet. You only saw Jim yesterday. Not even a little? - Not even a teensy-weensy bit. - Oh. Oh, you certainly got off to a flying start. I just love this. Now the next step is throw out everything in your closet and buy a completely new wardrobe. Oh, I'd love to, but you should have seen Harry's face when I told him I spent almost two weeks' food allowance on this. Food allowance? Edith, you shouldn't have to go to him for everything. Harry's a rich man. [Edith] Harry's a rich man? Grace, you don't mean we can afford.. Just about anything. You and your big mouth! Even the guys at the gas station know about it. - Perfect strangers. - What could I say? They asked me what's new. - Hi, baby. - Hi. - Where's your mother? - She's upstairs. Upstairs? How's she feeling? She sings a lot. [grunts] [sighs] - It's noontime, dear. - So? Where's lunch? Lunch? You just had breakfast! That was five hours ago. Oh, boy. Lunch, huh? Alright. lunch. Lunch, it will be, because that's all I'm here for, right? Lunch. Lunch you'll get! [instrumental music] Lunch. You gotta have lunch. [Kate] 'Well, where are you going?' 'You said you wanted lunch, didn't you?' [Edith] 'You think it's alright if I ask him now?' - Absolutely, just do it. - Yeah, I'll do it. Oh, Harry dear. Is Kate fixing lunch? She's doing something in there. - Hello, Grace. - How are you, Harry? Oh, never mind. I know how you are. Congratulations. - Harry. - Yeah? You know that extra room next to ours. - The one we never use? - Hm. I'd like to fix it up as a nursery. [Harry] If you want to, Edith. Uh, is it alright if I get new wallpaper? Yes, Edith. Get the best paper money can buy. [doorbell rings] Oh, Mayor Crane. - For you, my dear. - Oh, mayor. I just heard the wonderful news. I wanted to offer my congratulations. Well, thank you, mayor. Isn't that beautiful? - Look, Harry. - Ah! There he is! You old rascal, you. You're gonna show up every other old codger in town, huh? Congratulations, Harry. Now who'd have thought it? I just shook the hand that's going to rock the cradle! [laughing] Uh, mayor, mayor, uh, uh, you know Mrs. Kimbrough. Oh, Mrs. Kimbrough, of course. How nice to see you again. Oh, uh, tell me, didn't I judge a beauty contest that you were in last year? Yes, but I-I've aged considerably since then. Oh, come now. She's far too modest. Don't you think so, my dear? That's perfectly charming, mayor. You certainly have a way about you. Well, thank you, but, uh with me, I'm afraid it's mostly talk. Not like some fellows I know, huh, Harry, huh? [laughing] - Well, I can't stay. I-- - That's too bad. I've got a meeting down at the hall. I just wanted to pay my respects and, uh.. Oh, oh, oh, Harry, Harry, uh, I almost forgot. I have something to say to you. [chuckles] [clears throat] I am going to recommend to the city council that the contract for the new football field be given to Lambert Lumber Company. - You are? - Uh-huh. A baby gift. [chuckles] - Bye-bye, little mother. - 'Bye, mayor.' I don't believe it. He's got something up his sleeve. Four middle-aged married women on the city council that's what's up his sleeve. Huh? Oh, stop playing ostrich, Harry. To the middle-aged ladies of Calverton, you're a giant. You better get used to it. With a lot of wives, you've already become a household word. Bye-bye, dear. See you tomorrow. I wonder what the household word is. Never mind. Charlie! - 'Charlie!' - Yeah! He's eating and your lunch has been sitting all this time in the kitchen! Maybe that's why I've been sitting all this time in the living room. You have to realize this kind of work is new to Kate. What kind isn't? Charlie, let's go! We're late. Harry, dear, would you mind stopping at the market on the way home? For what? I know it's silly, but I have a longing for some pickled pigs' knuckles. [sighs] I don't know why but it just had to be pickled pigs' knuckles. Uh, 10:30. Fine time to get finished eating. How can a girl forget to put up dinner? Kate didn't forget to put up dinner, dear. She just forgot to light the oven. [Kate] 'Garbage!' Honey, I'm a businessman! Can't be expected to come home from a hard day's work and empty garbage! [Kate] 'I see, and I'm just made for garbage.' [chuckles] Oh, Charles, don't upset her. And you, too, Harry. Kate's had a long, hard day. - Thank you, dear. - Mm-hm. Oh. Well, go ahead. Aren't you gonna say it? I'm a big mess! Kate, you just cooked a delicious dinner. Oh, sure, mother. Would you take a look at my nails? Look at that. Look at my hair and my face. Well, go ahead and say it, all of you, I'm a big mess! 'A great big mess.' At least you look used for a change. Honey, honey, why don't you take an hour off tomorrow and, and go to the beauty parlor? Who gave you permission to give her an hour off? Now wait a minute. That happens to be my wife! And it happens to be working in my house. Well, I can get her a job just as good as this any place in town. Oh, Charlie! [plates clanking] Oh, excuse me. [sighs] Everyone seems to have changed so since last night. I thought announcing the baby would brighten our lives. Our lives are brightened, Edith. Only there's all kinds of brightness and this happens to be the kind of brightness that, uh.. Never mind. The baby's not going to go away simply because you're not ready to face it, Harry. Oh, I feel so happy. It seems that a whole new world has opened up for me. 'Don't you feel the same, Harry?' I was happy in the old world, Edith. Come on. Let's go to bed. You know, Harry, I think we've become a little old-fashioned. We should bring ourselves more up-to-date. I've even considered next time voting as a democrat. Edith, we took our marriage vows as republicans. That's right. Still mad? Unh-unh. Hey, I know everybody around here has been pretty tough on you and.. Well, for myself, I'm sorry. Hey, hey, I said I'm sorry. I didn't know all this housework could be so hard on you. Well, don't worry, honey. It's not gonna be too hard on me for long. Not after we get our maid. - We get our maid, uh, maid? - Mm-hm. You think your father will go for a maid? Mm-hm. He's going to have to, my dear. With two pregnant women in the house. Oh, two pregnant women in the.. Kate, y-y-you're, you're not preg-- No. I'm not. I'm glad you told me. But, um, Charlie, I'm going to be. Katie, we, we can't have a baby now. Why? Because we're not ready. And, uh, because we agreed to wait until a proper time and then discuss it. Charlie, this is the proper time and we are discussing it. Kate, you're just upset. [chuckles] Look at you. Kate, look at you. You're just.. Look at the house! Look, honey, the work is bound to get easier. You'll see. I know it's gonna get easier with a maid. Kate, Kate, you don't start a family out of anger or, or because you're jealous of your mother or.. That's just not any way to have a baby. Oh? Well, you'll just have to show me the way to have a baby. [chuckles] - Katie, listen to me. - Mm. You can't get pregnant now because.. ...I can't afford it. Honey, I'm not gonna charge you a cent. Kate.. [instrumental music] - Hi. - Hello there. Hey, wait a minute. Your folks are still up. [male #4 on TV] 'Are you comin' out, Rocco, or am I comin' in to get ya?' - 'Come and get me, copper!' - 'Alright, stand back, men!' [glass shattering on TV] [gunshots on TV] [male #5 on TV] 'It's your Sunday news roundup.' 'All the news up to the minute. Up to the minute, all the news.' [boy on TV] 'Welcome home, grandmother. Have a nice time?' [woman on TV] 'How could I miss without bad breath' 'or body odor to spoil the fun?' 'Thanks to you, grandson.' [male narrator on TV] Welcome to Thursday night at the movies. Tuesday night at the cinema. And now Saturday night at the films. [man #6 on TV] 'This is WWTV signing off and reminding you' 'that television is your best entertainment.' Are you sure this is what you and Ralph did to get pregnant, Helen? [Helen] 'Yeah, sure, it works.' But I've been taking my temperature nine, ten times a day. - It never goes down. - 'Well, what was it?' 98.6 till it's coming out of my ears. Going to lunch, Dave. Be gone about an hour. Okay, Mr. Lambert. Charlie, let's go. Sleep, sleep, sleep. What's it with you, anyway? For the past six weeks all you've done around here is sleep. I don't get as much sleep as you think. Well, if you didn't stay up watching television every night maybe you'd get some sleep. Television will be the death of you. - What's with this cat? - Oh, he's just resting. Resting, resting. Everybody's resting around here. He's as lazy as you are. Go out and catch some mice. [cat meowing] Come on, let's go. Alright, I'll keep trying. Now if it goes down half a point that's the time to call Charlie, right? - 'Right. Now--' - Gotcha. Okay, I gotcha. - 'You know when we did it--' - Well, alright, already. Will you stop talking and let me get this thermometer back in my mouth? Goodbye. Oh, Harry, I'm so glad you're here. - I've so much to tell you. - Don't tell me a thing. Just answer my questions. What's that and that and that? I'm asking for whats, Edith, and I want them. Fine. That's wood. This is tarpaper. That's a wheelbarrow. This is a new bathtub and, well, you know what that is. Of course, I know what it is and so do all our neighbors. What's it doing sitting here on our lawn? Well, that's where they unloaded it, dear. - What are you doing? - Just looking. For what? The hardware. Isn't he wonderful? The boy genius. Look, dad, if you don't want me around, just say so. Alright, I don't want you around. [Edith] Harry. It's alright, mom. It's alright. [Kate] Charlie! [gasps] Charlie! Can you come upstairs for a minute? Honey, why don't you come down here? I, I don't feel like climbing the stairs. The exercise will be good for you. I need you up here. Don't be lazy, dear. Go to her. Go see what she wants. And take that thing you're sitting on out of my sight. - Is it heavy? - Take it in and weigh it. [imitating Harry] Take it in and weigh it. Don't drop it, Charles. [sighs] You know, you're entirely too cross with him. Alright, don't let me get upset over Charlie. Let me get upset over you! There's nothing to get upset about, dear. They're starting the nursery. They're going to rip up the floor for the radiant heating. Knock out the window for the large glass bay. Now the wall separating it from our room is being torn-- Stop! - But I haven't finished yet. - Oh, yes, you have! You told me you were going to have the room repapered. Now what's the idea of all this? And that, uh, uh, thingamajig that Charlie took in there? I never heard of an infant using that kind of equipment. He won't be an infant forever, dear. Soon he'll be a grown boy. Harry, I've tried 50 times to tell you about the plans. - You said-- - I know what I said! But you didn't give me any idea of all this. Knocking out a wall. Putting in a glass bay. Radiant heating. Edith, what's the matter? You're yelling again. Makes me feel dizzy. - I might faint. - No, no, no. No, don't faint, Edith. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. I don't usually yell, you know. I was just trying to, trying to.. A-are you alright? - I'm better, I think. - I won't yell at you anymore. I'll yell at Charlie. Charlie! He should have told me about this. Charlie! Ow! What do you want? Why didn't you tell me you sent all this lumber over here from the yard? I didn't send that lumber over. I thought you did. - What do you mean, you didn't-- - Harry, Harry, Harry. That lumber came from Cooper's lumberyard. Cooper's? See, you're always yappin' at me for everything. Be quiet. [Kate] 'Charlie, I'm waiting.' Edith, I'm in the lumber business, remember? Why did you go to old man Cooper if you needed lumber? Mr. Foley, the contractor who does all the work around here told me we'd get it cheaper at Cooper's. So, actually, we saved money. You're a little high, Harry. - I don't believe it. - It's true. Edith, don't you understand? No matter what price I sell it for I still would have given it to you for cost. What am I talking about? I'd have given it to you for nothing. Oh. [music on TV] [male narrator on TV] Another episode of "The Ugliness Of Life." Television in the middle of the day. What's the world coming to? [male narrator on TV] Yesterday, Betty Ann learned about Helen's lumbago just before Ralph suffered his fatal sunstroke. [Edith] 'Oh, Harry, the mayor's on his way over.' Oh, no. Haven't I had enough for one day? [Betty on TV] 'Oh, Helen, you must tell me.' 'What is the problem between you and Ralph?' Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! - Now what do you want? - Get that thing out of sight. You ought to put it in the garage in the first place. Hurry up. The mayor's on his way. If it wasn't on the lawn. - What are you doing? - I don't know, dad. I never hid one of these things before. Well, well, put it, put it.. - Put it.. - Well, put it where? Put it in the clothes closet. Oh, mayor. What a lovely surprise. Well, well, well, well. How are you, mayor? Well, I'm fine, Harry. Just fine. - Shut the bathroom door. - Won't you come in, mayor? Well, thank you, thank you. Well, well, well, this is a surprise. - Won't you sit down, mayor? - No, no, I'm sorry. I've just got a minute but I have some very nice news for you, Harry. - Oh? - Yes, I.. [laughs] Hiya, mayor. Charlie. Well, what a surprise. Thanks. Well, as I was saying the city swung the deal for the land for the new stadium. They should be breaking ground in just a few months. - That is good news. - It sure is. Yes, sir, the city could be having its stadium just about the time the little mother is having her baby. [chuckles] Huh, right, Harry? I'm sure that's just a coincidence, mayor. It really wasn't planned that way, mayor. Edith, you don't have to explain. [chuckles] Hey, with a contract this big we ought to get a forklift and a new truck-- That's a good idea. You know, you have to spend a little to make a little. Only, Harry, don't just completely renovate the whole yard and then write it off on the city's expense. [laughs] And-and he would, too, you know. Knock it off. It's good of you to bring us the good news, mayor. - Yes, sir. - No. Especially in person and all. Well, I'm just a servant of the people. Oh, Harry, I meant to ask you. What's that stuff doing on your lawn? Oh, ha ha, oh, we're just fixing up a little. - Oh. - It's a nursery. You know, for the baby. A nursery for the little baby. Isn't that marvelous? You know, the rest of us old-timers are building nest eggs for retirement. But Harry Lambert, he's building a nursery. [laughs] You, you know, Harry if you were to run for mayor now you'd get the vote of every woman in town. [laughs] Yeah, well, back to the factory. [whistling "Rock-a-bye Baby"] Goodbye. You did have to mention the nursery, didn't you? Oh, what do you want me to do? Lie? Come on, let's get this tub in the garage and out of sight. Oh, do we have to do it now? I don't want it sitting out here in the lawn. Well, it's not connected. You know something? I don't think you're connected. - Let's go. - Don't you tell me let's go. I'll tell you let's go. Let's go. [instrumental music] [no audio] [instrumental music] [no audio] I'm glad you decided to come to see me about this, uh, situation. I'm not going to call it a problem because a simple fact is, there are a great many perfectly normal couples that take years to conceive. I don't wanna wait years. I want a baby now. Uh, you see, Kate thinks it's like ordering groceries or something. [laughing] Well, now, Kate, I'd like to see you have a baby now, too, if that's what you want. I just don't want to see you get anxious about it. To put it succinctly, I think it's too early for sterility tests. Sterility tests? There is nothing wrong with my sterility. No, no, that's not what I meant-- Charlie. You, too, Kate. You know, you're giving a good demonstration of what I was trying to tell you. For two people who love each other.. You do love each other? [yawns] All the time. It never used to be a complaint. Now, listen, without getting into a whole lot of medical jargon you know, just about nothing ever goes right when we're tense. If you feel you have to get a homerun every time you come up to bat you never even get on first base. 'It's only when we're free and relaxed' that we get things done. And it is that way with, uh, conception, you understand? - I understand. Does he? - Hey, you call that relaxed? I challenge anybody to get her pregnant. Oh, do you? Well, I just might go out and find somebody to accept that little challenge. [Charlie] Kate, stop. I, I didn't mean it that way. I.. I don't know what I'm saying anymore. Besides, it was your idea to come here in the first place. And the chances are you won't have to come up here again. Now, look, it's a lovely Saturday. 'Why don't you go off by yourselves away from the house' 'just the two of you and, you know, simply relax?' Hm. [sighs] Sounds awful good, Charlie. - Yeah, let's do it. - Come on. - Okay, let's go. - Oh. Have a lovely day, children, and relax. - Thanks, Jim. Bye. - Bye, dear. - Bye-bye, doc. - Charlie. Thank you. Relax. Okay, now don't scratch the wallpaper and whatever you do, don't nick the door frame. What the devil's going on here? Sorry, Mr. Lambert. We thought this was the new bathroom. - Does it look like a bathroom? - No-- Get out. Out! Wait a second! What are you doing here Saturday morning, anyway? We're just pushing to finish the job, Mr. Lambert. Well, do your pushing from Monday to Friday when it won't cost me overtime. Now get it out of here and take it back to the garage. Okay, okay, watch it on the way out and watch the door frame. - 'Thank golly.' - Always interrupting. Can't get a little sleep on a Saturday morning. Oh, I'm sorry, dear. Did they wake you? No, I'm still sleeping. - It's Saturday. - 'So?' So we're going shopping for the layette. Edith, why do I have to go shopping with you for junk like that? Because it happens to be your baby, too, Harry Lambert, and.. Do you know that we haven't been seen together in public for months? Sometimes I think you want it that way. Why don't you ask Kate to go shopping with you? She'll be really hurt if you don't ask her. 'Cause she and Charles have already left for an appointment. Well, I have a luncheon at noon. So you meet me downtown at half past 2:00. Don't you disappoint me, Harry. [instrumental music] Hello. - What do you say, Harry? - Hey, George. - Hello, Edith. - Oh, hello, Jean. [grunts] Excuse me. Well, hello, Mr. Lambert. How are you? - Hi, Rose. - Hi, Harry. Harry! Harry, you really are on time. I've got so many wonderful things to show you. Come. - Great, great. I'm here. - Come, dear. Come. - We're going in here first. - I'm here. [Edith] Oh, it's gonna be so much fun. Come on. Oh, Harry, Harry, look. Isn't this adorable? See the little figures? And the stripes? Don't you just love the little tassels? - You don't? - I've got nothing against them. - I just can't say I love them. - Well, I do. Uh, miss. Looking for something in a crib and mattress, are we? This one's made by Baby Betsy. You know, the young people don't appreciate quality. That's why I just love to wait on grandparents. Look, darling. Which do you want, the blue or the pink? I-I'll take both. Thank you. - Harry Lambert. - Oh, hello, Don. Why, you old hound dog, you. Say, it's been three years now, hasn't it since, uh, Sally and I moved to Albany? Hey, hey, this is just a trip because my daughter is, uh, you know she's expecting any day now and, uh.. Well, she just married last year, eh, so, uh.. Yeah, well, listen to me go on. What's new with you, Harry? Harry, look. Hello, Don. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] If you want anything, just ring. Alright. Oh, uh.. - Yeah, here. - Thank you. Have fun. Yeah. You know, for a motel room, this is really charming. Yeah, yeah, it's, uh, charming. [chuckles] [laughing] Well. [clears throat] [humming] Hm. Hey, look at this. Oh, yeah. It's, uh, a cat. Interesting. Bed's soft. [laughs] [sighs] Oh, this is so orange. Yeah, it's a orange bedspread. [laughing] [sighs] [sighs] - Hi. - Hi there. [chuckles] Well. You know, honey, Jim was right. Now this was the thing to do. Just get away from everything and relax. I know, I know, you can't hit a homerun unless you relax. [sighs] - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh. Come on. Let's pop the cork, huh, before it gets warm? Hey, catch. I'll get the glasses. [pops] Oh, I am so relaxed. Aren't you, Charlie? Relaxed? Yes, I've never been so relaxed. - Come on. - Here. - For you? - Give me a lot. - And that's all you get. - Okay. Come on now, you make the toast, huh, fit the occasion? Uh, toast to fit the occasion. Uh, here's to good health. Hey, can't you think of anything more romantic than that? What's the matter with good health? Well, nothin'. That was a real good toast, Charlie. I mean, after all, without good health what else is there, right? - Right, yeah. - Oh, come on, sweetheart. You just relax. Katie, I am relaxed. You just practice what you preach. Oh, I haven't upset you now, have I? No, I'm not upset at all. No. Baby's not upset. Not much. Oh, don't start with that baby talk. - Don't make fun of me, Katie. - Oh, come on. Stop it, Charlie. I'm not making fun of you. I was only kidding. I'm just tryin' to ease the tension around here. Now come on. Well, I got news for you, honey. That's impossible! Come on, Charlie, relax. Relax! Don't you say that word relax to me again! How can anybody relax around here? You're makin' us act like a couple of dopes. That's what you're doin'. A motel room in the middle of the afternoon. Well, I'm sorry, honey but I don't think lovemaking ought to be plotted. I think it ought to just...happen. Oh, sure. Sure, if I left it up to you to let it happen you know when it would? Every time they throw tea into the Boston Harbor. [mumbles] There, you call that relaxed? No, I don't, Charlie. I don't call this relaxed because I'm not relaxed. And I just figured out why I'm not relaxed because you're not relaxed. And you're not relaxed because you don't want a baby, Charlie. So I never denied it. It was your idea. Oh, well, it goes a little deeper than that, my dear. It isn't because we can't afford a baby, Charlie. 'It's because you can't face the responsibility.' Because if we had this baby, Charlie Clinton you'd have to grow up! Oh, look who's talkin' about growin' up. You know somethin', up until six months ago you didn't know how to boil an egg. Well, I am boiling them now, boy, oh, boy! You know, I thought it was my father who's kept you from growing up but that is not the way it is at all. 'Yelling at you as if you were a child.' You've been hiding, Charlie, behind my father's temper. Blaming it instead of yourself! Katie, that's a.. ...dumb thing to say and you know it. Now let's just get out of here before we both go nuts. No. Now come on, Charlie, we agreed to this. This is doctor's orders. When I want a doctor, I'll get sick first. You big jerk! Hi. Nice to see you. Yes, we've been shopping. Hi. [instrumental music] Oh, hi, sergeant. Hello, Mrs. Lambert. [blows whistle] [tires screeching] - Sergeant. - Hello, Mrs. Lambert. How nice of you to stop the traffic. - Come on, Harry. Come on. - My pleasure. [cars honking] [indistinct chatter] - Thank you. Come on, Harry. - Have a good day. Alright, alright. Alright, I'm coming. Oh, no, you don't. I've had it. Oh, but we haven't finished yet. - Maybe you haven't, but I have. - Just one more stop, Harry. I want to go to the Pink Di-Dee. The Pink Di-Dee? You're not gonna get me into any Pink Di-Dee and that's final. Harry, you'd think I was draggin' you to I-don't-know-what the way you carry on. I don't know why shopping with me can't be fun. Fun? You call this fun? I'll tell you what fun is. Fun is tending to business down at the yard, working. Not this female nonsense. Fun is when I go through that gate and the men say, "Morning, sir" and I say, "Morning, men." Then I sit down in my office and get Harold Cress on the phone and tell him he'd better pay the balance of his bill or else. That's fun. Fun isn't just something to laugh about. I like serious fun. Oh, but, dear, I thought that you were having fun shopping and that you were going to enjoy it with me. You thought. Well, following you around, making a damn fool of myself that's not fun. Harry, I think I'm going to faint. Well, go ahead and faint. I'm going down to the lumberyard and have some fun. [instrumental music] - 'Oh.' - Kate. 'Where have you been?' Nowhere, mother. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. Whatever it is, it can't be that bad. Oh, yes, it is. It's worse. What happened, dear? You can tell me. [sighs] Oh, mom. It was supposed to be a secret. I wanted to surprise everybody when it happened. When what happened? - A baby. - Ba.. I've been trying to get pregnant. Oh, Kate, how wonderful. Well, it could be, except I'm practically doing it all by myself. Kate. Well, it's true, mother. My husband doesn't want a baby. He's too selfish. He's nothing but a big jerk. - Kate! - All men are jerks. Now, Kate, you're not to talk that way. Why? You know, men are only interested in themselves. [sighs] That's true, dear. Why do they marry us then? They don't. We marry them. And then we spend the rest of our lives trying to convince them that we are good enough for them. Kate dear, you sound almost bitter. You know that Charles couldn't live without you. Well, I couldn't live without him either. The only difference is I know I can't and he doesn't. Men are busy about other things, dear. I suppose they just don't think about their wives that much. - Well, they should. - I know. And they can if we help them, mother. - But I don't understand. - You will. - 'Lambert Lumber.' - Hello? Uh, this is Mrs. Clinton. May I speak to my husband, please? - 'Just a minute.' - Thank you. - Hello, Charlie? - 'Uh-huh?' Charlie, go to hell! Kate! He's thinkin' about me now, mother. [instrumental music] - 'Lambert Lumber.' - Uh, uh, this is Mrs. Lambert. And I'd like to speak to Mr. Lambert, please. - 'Just a moment, Mrs. Lambert.' - Alright. - 'Hello.' - Hello, Harry? - 'Yes.' - This is Edith. - 'What is it, Edith?' - Go to hell! [Harry] 'What?' [instrumental music] Hey! What? I'll tell you something else. Go ahead. - You know why we're this way? - Hm? We're this way on account of women. They hate us. Who cares? Who-who needs them in the first place? But we're not in the first place anymore. We're in the second place. [laughs] Um.. ...as long as we're alone.. ...would you like to know a real secret? Promise not to tell anybody. Okay. What's the secret? Shh. Kate wants to get pregnant. Constantly. Must be a kind of virus goin' around here. And as long as we're on embarrassing subjects.. Yeah? ...why don't you give me a raise, huh? 'Cause I don't know why I pay you a salary in the first place. Well, you seem to forget, sir, that I went to college. They pay you more than I do? More cherries, bartender. - You want another drink? - 'Why not?' Well, I gotta hand it to you.. ...you old Harry Lambert, you. You sure can handle your liquor. [laughs] That's because I'm a man among men. - Barman. - Barman. - Barman! - Yeah? Two more pink ladies. [sighs] [chuckles] [car approaches] [tires screech] [indistinct singing] [Charlie] Keep the change. [continues singing] - 'Hey!' - 'Hey!' [Harry] 'You see the light change?' What are you, drunk or something? Goodnight, taxi cab! ♪ Goodnight taxi cab ♪ ♪ We're glad to see you go ♪ ♪ Goodnight taxi cab ♪ ♪ Goodnight taxi cab ♪ ♪ Goodnight taxi cab ♪ ♪ We're glad to see you go ♪♪ [both laughing] What have we done to them? I've never seen them like this before. Neither have I. - We've gone too far. - You think so? [laughing] [Mayor Crane] Hey, what's going on down there? Who's that? [Mayor Crane] You know what time it is? Do we know what time is it? What kind of a question is that? What do you think we are, stupid or something? Of course, we know what time it is. Go fry an egg! He's right. Go fry an egg! Is that you, Lambert? Ooh. That's for him to know.. ...and for you to find out! Yeah, that's for him to know and me to find out. You want some good advice? You quiet down. Waking up the whole neighborhood. Now go to bed! Go to bed yourself! The party's just starting. And you're not invited! [both laughing] - What? - I got a idea. Where'd you get it? You wanna show big ballot box what we think of him? - Right. - You wanna get him mad? - I mean, really mad? - R-r-right! You do? Then fall along with me. [dramatic music] Well, come on, mom, let's wait upstairs for them. No, no, I want to be here and apologize to your father. No, I don't think that's a good idea, mother. Come on. Now be careful. - Well-- - Come on. Is this gonna be somethin'? Or is this gonna be somethin'? It's gonna be somethin'. This is really gonna be something. [dramatic music] Shh. 'Shh.' 'Shh.' The coast is clear. Come on. Roger. Psst, psst. Come on, come on. Ready, 007? Ready, Mr. Goldfinger. Now. [both laughing] [band music] Left turn, march! [knock on door] Left turn! [knock on door] Who's that? We didn't invite anybody to the party! You know somethin'? Maybe we did. Let him in! The more, the merrier. Forward march! Ten-hut! Now just what do you.. [music stops] I saw you, Lambert, and, and you. I saw the both of you. And, uh, that thing you left on my lawn. You're gonna pay for it! He already did. $64 he paid. [laughing] You'd better learn some respect. Respect? Respect for what? You, for instance? The only reason you're the mayor instead of me is because you fought a dirty campaign. - You tell him, dad. - Now listen, Lambert-- Now another thing! You know what you are always was and always will be? Nothing but a democrat. Hear, hear. Alright, Lambert. You finally slandered me. Your lumber contract for the new stadium was sent up for my signature just yesterday. You think I'm gonna sign it after this? In a pig's eye. In a big, fat pig's eye. What's he so mad about? After we painted bought a forklift.. ...a brand-new truck.. ...spent all that money. - Look what you did to me. - Me? If it wasn't for you, all this wouldn't have happened. You must be drunk. Well, well, how do you think I got this way, huh? Because of you. That's how you think I got this way. Sure, blame it on me! Sure. Blame everything on me! You want to know somethin'? After living with you for three years I think everything's my fault. Everything. I'm psyched! [blows raspberry] 'That's why I'm 27 years old' and I am still living in my father-in-law's home. Home. Are you kidding? You're 27 years old and still living in my home because it's safe and warm in here. You've got yourself psyched, boy.. ...'cause you haven't got the guts to go out and face life. [instrumental music] That's a lie. I'm a liar, huh? Okay. You asked for it. Put 'em up. - Oh, this is a showdown, huh? - You bet it is. Oh, yeah? Well, every time has to come. [dramatic music] Missed me. Huh! You watch this haymaker. Ugh! Oh, give up, huh? Had enough, huh? - Charlie! - 'Harry!' - Oh! - Giving up, huh? Harry, please don't fight, dear, don't fight. - Oh. - Probably a lucky punch. Daddy, how could you be such a bully? It was all fair and square. Oh, are you alright, dear? [Edith] 'Are you sure you're not hurt?' A-are you sure you're not hurt? - I took all he had. - Oh. I was probably hit below the belt. [gasps] Charlie, you weren't! Oh! Harry, Charles, apologize to each other. This isn't like either one of you. Oh, yes, it is, mother. It's just like both of them. One is as bad as the other. Come on, you. We're going upstairs. Ooh! Where are they? Harry, I'm sorry about everything, dear. I mean, the phone call. I know I shouldn't have done it. Say something to me, dear. Say something, Harry. [intense music] - Please? - Don't touch me. I'm sick and tired of everything. I'm going upstairs. Well, do you want me to come with you? - What for? - Well, to talk about us. Maybe say something that will make everything alright again. Nothing's ever gonna be alright again! Oh, Harry, how can you say that? Because it's the truth, that's how. I was once a nice, respectable citizen. Now I'm the talk of the town. I even lost the stadium contract. I am a big fool. That's what I am. A man my age having a baby. Don't you think I know everybody's laughing at me, huh? - That's not true. - Oh, it isn't, isn't it? Well, why do you think I got these dark glasses, huh? I didn't get them from any eye doctor. I bought them to hide behind 'so as nobody could recognize me.' I'm just a big joke. That's what I am. A great big joke. Harry, I know that's not true. How could you? Sashaying around, living a gay life buying everything you can lay your eyes on. 'What kind of an idiot are you trying to make out of me, huh?' 'Look at me.' You finally even drove me to drink. I'm disgraced. I'm ruined. Harry, I knew you weren't prepared to face having the baby but I didn't really know you felt like this. How could you? You're not having the baby, I am! All you're having is a picnic. Just leave me alone! [mumbling] I don't know why I'm still so thirsty after all that liquor. Oh, my head is so big. [gasps] Ooh, that's cold. It's good for you. It might clear your silly head. It's gonna take a little more than that to clear my silly head. You heard what your father said. 'You said the same thing yourself, Katie.' I'm gonna make it without that crutch. You don't need it anymore, Charlie. Lean on yourself now.. ...and we can start thinking about our own home.. ...and making babies. Lots of them. Kate, Charlie, drop everything and come in here! 'Kate, Charlie, do you hear me?' - What is it, dad? - She's gone. - Who? Who's gone? - What? - She's run away. - Who has run away? - Who? - She's, she's-- - Let me see that. - I must have dozed off. - When I woke up, I found that. - What does it say, honey? "And ever since the day I told you I was going to have a baby "everybody has been so unhap, unhappy. "So if I'm not here, maybe you will all learn to smile again. "Nobody's smiled here for a long time. Goodbye." - I smiled yesterday. - Oh, daddy. Well, we're not gonna stand around here and moan about it. - We gotta do something. - 'Yes, please, Charlie.' - What are you doing? - I'm gonna call the police. You wanna find her, don't you? Of course, I wanna find her. - Hello, get me the police. - The police? I'll talk to them. Daddy, Charlie will handle it. I don't need Charlie. I'll handle it myself. Hello, uh, police, I wanna report a missing person. Stop all transportation. Don't let anything leave town. [male #7] 'What's your name?' There's a woman in no condition to.. Huh? - 'What's your name?' - Never mind my name. I don't want this in the newspaper. Now you listen to me, this happens to be my wife. - 'What does she look like?' - You can't miss her. She's an old pregnant woman. - Daddy, mother isn't that old. - Oh, hold it. She's an old pregnant woman who doesn't look her age. There's been nobody picked up tonight yet. What? No, we don't get many pregnancy cases. But the only transportation out of town at this hour is the bus to Boston. - Where's my hat? - What? - Where's my hat? - Where's our mother? - What did they say? - Downstairs. I know. What's he think this is? "Peyton Place?" [instrumental music] [tires screech] Edith, wait a minute! Don't go! Where are you going? Wait a minute! Edith, Edith, wait! Don't go! Don't go! Edith, wait! Edith! [instrumental music] Edith! 'Edith!' [tires screeching] [chickens clucking] [cow mooing] [instrumental music] - This is the end of the trail. - This is the beginning for me. - You're coming home. - I'm not. Well, have you any idea what you're doing, huh? Why are you bothering with me, Harry? You don't want me anymore. You're ashamed of me. - Ashamed of you? - That's right. You're ashamed of me and of the baby. - You realize people can hear? - I don't care who can hear. Now, look, this is no place to discuss anything. I didn't ask you to follow me here. Are you trying to create a scandal? I don't care. I'm pregnant, you did it. - And you've got to face it. - Edith! Harry, I didn't impregnate you. You impregnated me. Edith, this is a public place. Well, what if it is? I can't keep apologizing for our baby. I'm proud to be having this child. - So am I. - Wha.. I am, Edith. I am. Harry, you know how you've been behaving. Never mind how I've been behaving. Did I ever actually walk up to you and say "Edith, I'm not proud to be having our baby?" - Did I? - No, Harry, you didn't. Alright then, Edith. Harry. You know, Edith we haven't been together in Boston for a long time. Not since our honeymoon, Harry. That's right. Taxi. What are you doing that for? Do you realize what they charge for this place? - They have maid service. - Yeah, that's silly. I just don't want some strange maid walking in and seeing the place looking like this. You'll never change, Edith. We can't all be as pliable as you, dear. That's true. Why didn't you wake me up earlier? You know I never sleep this late. Because you were exhausted. Besides, it gave me a chance to have your suit pressed. Gave me a chance to get some of the things we need if we're going to stay here a few days. - Do you like the tie? - Wait a minute. I didn't say I was going to stay here a few days. Do you realize what Charlie could do to me in a few days? He could ruin me, that's what he could do. Well, after all these years you should at least give him the chance. Well, I think we should call Kate and Charles. - Okay, get them. - They must be worried. - 'Yes?' - Long distance, please. - 'Long distance?' - Yes. I'd like to speak to Calverton. Klondike 5-5-0-1-8. Thank you. Yes, this is Mrs. Lambert in...room 609. [phone ringing] They're ringing, dear. [telephone rings] - Hello. - 'Kate?' [gasps] Mother. Charlie, mom! - Mother, where have you-- - Is she alright? I'm so happy to hear from you, mother. Is everything alright? We've been worried sick about you. Of course, everything's alright. I'm with your father here in Boston. In Boston? Wonderful. Let, let me talk to Charlie. - Mom? - 'Charlie?' Dad, so you found mom okay? Of course, I found her. We're here together, aren't we? - Now look here, Charlie-- - Listen, dad. As long as you're in Boston, why don't you and mother just stay there for a few days? That's a good idea, dad. You could use a little vacation. Don't tell me when I can take a vacation. Sounds as if you're trying to get me out of the way or something. No, no, no, no. It's not that at all. We just thought that if, well if you'd like to have a second honeymoon you don't have to worry about anything down here 'cause everything's under control. Oh, yes, dad. Everything is just great. Now all that's important is that you and mother just forget about everything. Have a really good time. You stop worrying about your mother and me having a good time and tell that husband of yours to start worrying about the business. If he'd have worried about the business before we wouldn't have lost that stadium deal. Oh, that. About the, uh, contract for the football field, dad.. Hey, mayor! The mayor and I were just talking and.. I think he's out of his mind. He says the mayor's there. It's Harry. This is the mayor. Hiya, Lambert. - The mayor is there. - Oh. He's on the phone. [Mayor Crane] 'Say, Charlie and I were just talking out' 'a few details on the stadium.' Lambert Lumber is sure gonna be busy. Too busy for its president to be running for mayor. - Right, Lambert? - What? Oh, now Charlie's here, said he'd talk to you. He said that you promised to give up your plans to run for mayor if I worked out the stadium contract. Oh, oh, oh, oh, my plans for running for mayor. Yes, I-I have given them up. 'A private survey I took' 'says that I could get every woman's vote in town.' Yes, I know. Charlie told me. Charlie told you? He did, did he? Well, now let's cut out the small talk. 'See that we have the signed papers in one week.' Right away. And thanks a lot, Lambert. It's a pleasure doing business with an old established firm. [chuckles] Bye. Charles Clinton of Lambert Lumber Company here. Charlie, never let it be said that I don't appreciate a piece of smart thinking. When you get down to the office tomorrow have your name printed on your door. I haven't got a door. Then get one! He wants me to get a door and he wants me to put my name on that door! Oh, Charlie! Oh, Charlie! - You're a partner! - Yeah! - Harry. - Hm? Nothing. Just Harry. You know, Edith, I've been thinking. Hm? With the baby coming and everything you're gonna have a maid. - Maid? - With a uniform. Why, Harry, I don't need a maid. I won't take no for an answer, Edith. It's a big house, you know. And you're not as young as you look. Oh, Harry, that's a nice thing to say. Do you really think I look young? You've always had a pretty face. I've noticed that. Oh, Harry, you're so romantic. - Oh. - Oh, yes, you are. Don't you try to squirm out of it. - Well. - You see? You admit it. Sometimes maybe. I am pretty young for my age, you know. Of course, you are. We're both young in a way. That's why it's so wonderful having this baby. We're still part of what makes things grow.
