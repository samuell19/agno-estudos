I'M AFRAID I HAD TO TELL THAT LITTLE LIE TO PROTECT HER. SHE WAS IN NO SHAPE TO SEE ANYONE, BUT SHE'S FINE NOW. YOU SEE, STONE, WE TAKE THESE KIDS HOOKED ON DRUGS AND WORSE. WE GIVE THEM A HOME, A FAITH, SOMETHING STRONGER THAN DRUGS, VIOLENCE, AND FORNICATION. WE BRING THEM BACK INTO THE ARMS OF JESUS, A LIVING, POWERFUL FORCE. NO ONE'S HERE AGAINST THEIR WILL. YOU WANT TO SEE AMY? THEY'RE AT THE BEACH NOW, BUT TOMORROW'S OUR BAPTISMAL DAY, A DAY OF GLORY FOR JESUS. NOW I WARN YOU ONE THING, STONE. WHEN YOU SPEAK WITH HER, WALK IN THE PEACEFUL PATH OF JESUS. WE WILL NOT TOLERATE VIOLENCE. I TELL YOU THIS AS A HUMBLE SERVANT OF THE LORD. IT'S A MIGHTY HUMBLE CAR YOU GOT THERE. REVEREND. THE LORD PROVIDES. JESUS! JESUS! JESUS! TAKE THIS CHILD INTO THY BOSOM AND WIPE AWAY THE STAIN OF CAIN.

EVERYBODY'S GOT TO HAVE JESUS IN HIS HEART. THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. LOOK AROUND YOU. THIS IS WHERE IT'S HAPPENING. THE DEVIL'S OUT THERE TO EAT YOUR ASS. * HE'S GOT THE WIND AND RAIN * * IN HIS HANDS * HE'S GOT THE WIND AND RAIN * * IN HIS HANDS * HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS * * HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD... * IS MY DAUGHTER DOWN THERE? I HAVEN'T SPOTTED HER YET. WHAT'S GOING ON THERE? WHAT ARE THEY DOING? SOME SORT OF BAPTIZING. BAPTIZING? DO YOU THINK THEY'RE BAPTIZING AMY? I SUPPOSE SHE'S DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE.

BROTHER STONE. PARSON. IT'S "REVEREND." MR. DOLE WANTS TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER. WHAT KIND OF A MONSTER ARE YOU, ANYWAY? LOOK AT THIS-- THIS... THIS WHAT, MR. DOLE? AND WHAT MAKES ME A MONSTER? BRINGING THE LOVE OF JESUS INTO THE HEARTS OF THESE LOST SOULS? THEY'RE LIKE ANIMALS. WE'RE ALL ANIMALS, MR. DOLE. THE LOVE OF JESUS IS THE ONLY THING THAT LIFTS US ABOVE THE BEAST. HOW DO I TALK TO HIM, STONE? TELL HIM YOU WANT TO TALK TO YOUR DAUGHTER. THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING YOU, MR. DOLE. AMY'S OVER THERE. DO YOU BELIEVE IN JESUS? I'M JEWISH. GROOVY. SO WAS HE. THAT WAS HIS PROBLEM. I DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM. I'M NOT EVEN ORTHODOX. BUT YOU BELIEVE THERE WAS A JESUS. IT'S HISTORY, RIGHT? LOOK, I WAS JUST WATCHING. NOW YOU JUST SUPPOSE THAT JESUS CAME DOWN AS THE SAVIOR AND JUST SUPPOSE PEOPLE MADE A MISTAKE AND DIDN'T BELIEVE. EVEN THE PRESIDENT CAN MAKE A MISTAKE. THE BELIEVERS HAD AS MUCH RIGHT AS THE PHARISEES WHO TURNED THEIR BACK ON HIM. THEY SAW THE LIGHT, BUT WOULDN'T BELIEVE. THEIR PRIDE AND EGO WOULDN'T ACCEPT HIM. IF YOU BELIEVE AND DON'T ACCEPT HIM, YOU ARE AS UNHIP AS THEY ARE AND YOU ARE DAMNED. DON'T YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR SOUL? BELIEVE IN THE LIVING JESUS WHO DIED FOR YOU. AMY. AMY. AMY. IT'S DAD. YOU'RE NOT MY FATHER. YOU'RE A LIAR. ANYWAY, JESUS IS MY FATHER. I'VE COME TO TAKE YOU HOME. THIS IS MY HOME. NOW GO AWAY. SEE WHAT YOU DID? SHE WAS COMING AROUND. AMY! MR. DOLE. MY SUGGESTION TO YOU IS THAT YOU LEAVE. YOU'VE BRAINWASHED HER. THAT'S NOT THE GIRL I BROUGHT UP. YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING TO HER. OF COURSE I HAVE, MR. DOLE. I GAVE HER JESUS. YOU SON OF A BITCH. WHERE DID I MISS? WHERE DID I GO WRONG? WHATEVER SHE WANTED, I WORKED MY HEART TO GET FOR HER. YEAH, WELL, MAYBE THAT'S IT. HUH? JUST KEEP WALKING. AMY. I GOT A MESSAGE FOR YOU. HARRY CHESS IS DEAD. HEY. HEY, YOU! STOP! WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT CHESS? HE'S DEAD. YOU'RE A LIAR. HE'S GOING TO MEET ME HERE TODAY. SOMEBODY WILL HAVE TO GET HIM OUT OF THE MORGUE. WHERE'S THE HEROIN, AMY? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU'LL HAVE TO WHEN THE POLICE GET THERE. CHESS CONFESSED EVERYTHING BEFORE HE DIED. YOU'VE GOT IT. TELL ME WHERE IT IS. IT'LL GO EASIER ON YOU. IT'S--IT'S FOR JESUS. WE WERE GOING TO SELL IT TO HELP PEOPLE. DON'T BE STUPID. HE USED YOU TO HIDE IT. HE WAS GOING TO KILL YOU AFTER HE GOT RID OF IT. YOU'RE A LIAR! CHESS LOVES ME. HE LOVES JESUS. AMY! COPS, MAN! SPLIT! REVEREND AVERY! AMY! REVEREND AVERY! REVEREND AVERY! LEAVE HER ALONE! NOW I GOT YOU, YOU LITTLE BITCH! LEAVE ME ALONE! STONE! DON'T. DON'T. DON'T. GO DOWN AND PICK HIM UP.
