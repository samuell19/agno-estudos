It was really delightful today. I want to go again. Do you really think so? Oh, tricky question. I'm sorry. Hey, can we take a photo? - What? - As a memory. Come on in. Mr. Kawada must be popular. Divorced men aren't popular. Really? I really enjoyed the food today. - See you. - See you again. Oh wait. Wait a moment. Ms. Hiromi. I... I like Ms. Hiromi. If it's okay, please date me. I'm back. - Is that so? - I'm back. - I'm here. - Yeah. - You've worked hard. - No, no, wait a minute. - Seriously. - What's that reaction? Annoying. Anyway, you didn't get confessed to, did you? Oh my, how did you know? How... Enough! Drop dead. What's that? Let's take a bath. Ms.Hiromi, What makes you call me at this hour? I was thinking about what to answer earlier. Huh? That's fast. I've been thinking about it since then. So... So? It's just that you being divorced is a concern. But I don't dislike Mr. Kawada. You're cool and respectable. So, I hope things continue as they have until now. Right. What is it? Are we meeting again? Of course, as a friend. - I see. - Well, next time... Sure. Aya! Is there any snack? Let's celebrate, congrats! Aya! Aya! Aya! Are we meeting again? What's that supposed to mean? What's with that 40-year-old guy? Is he a high school student? Aren't you going to stop doing that? I just want someone to pine for me. Im just pushing them away after making them like me. Look over there, find someone to date properly. Dating will leave a bitter taste. It's easier to hear good things. They call women like you "bitch." Even if they do, I'm fine with it. Better than being a sex maniac. What? Are you picking a fight? - Huh? - You've worked hard. Welcome back. - Yes, I'm back. - Welcome back. - Isn't it a bit late? - Yeah. - What's this, Celebration? - It's always that. - Ah, that cheesy thing. - Yes. Say whatever you want. - Koji? - Hm. - Any snacks? - Just wait a moment. Sure. But dress a little more fancy. Won't more guys be attracted? Fool, that won't work. Why? When an innocent-looking girl talks Racy, people think, "Interesting." But if a glamorous woman does it, they assume she's up for sex. I'm just giving them a taste and then pushing them away. Looking innocent works better. You're the ultimate low-class poser, "bitch." - Bitch? - Yeah. I like that. Perfect for me. Perfect for me, let's shout it out. Tomorrow, too, "bitch" tactics will catch men. All right! Yo, let's go! Charge! That's right! - Take off! - Who are you talking to? I Was A Secret Bitch. In dating, the highest attraction is achieved with 15-20% skin exposure. Keep that ratio in mind, choose transparent and light fabrics, evoking thoughts of women's underwear. Additionally, showing collarbones reminds people of bare feet, making it even more effective! Graduate from being a cheap fool, become a pure and good-feeling innocent girl. Ms. Hiromi. - Sorry, did you wait? - No, not at all. Mid-level company's sales rep Sakaguchi, commonly known as a normal guy. what's wrong? Oh, today as well, your outfit looks nice. - Really? - Yeah. Normal guys won't take risky actions, even if their desire is strongly stimulated. So, l'll push him gently. I'm here! What's wrong? Uh, well... What? what? - Ms. Hiromi, you know.. - Yeah. What do you think of me? What about you, Sakaguchi? - Me, me? - Yeah. Yes, You should tell first. I... I? I like Ms. Hiromi. Done it! Thank you, I'm happy. So, will you go out with me? Give me a little time to think. Huh? I guess so. We shouldn't rush, right? That's enough for now. Just knowing you like me Is enough for me. "Open Your Eyes to Asia," give me two copies. Sure, got it. - Please check these two tickets. - Thank you. Sorry I'm late. - No worries, I just got here too. - Thank God. The second one today is Herbivore Man, Funaki. - Shall we go? - Hm. - The road was very complicated. - What's that? I forgot. I forgot. I told you I work at the department store. Yeah. This month, my sales were really low working by myself. What should I do? To be popular, it's about how much Distance you keep... That's important. But you can just continue as usual. After bad things, good things always follow, right? You're just overthinking. - It will, won't it? - Yeah. Mr. Funaki is truly amazing. Even an insecure man like him... I.. If it's about your worries, Ms. Hiromi, I'll listen anytime. - Really? - Really. why? Why... B-because... Ms. I like Hiromi. It's Second time today! Oh, sorry. No, I'm really happy. The third one today is this guy. The carnivorous type, IT company, Mr. Nagata. - The pasta was delicious today. - Thankfully. The drinks are good too. For carnivorous men, it's all about the Appearance. You look sexy today. Even if you compliment me, It'll be useless, you know. If you do something like body touch, He might try to take you away, so be careful. Cheers. I feel a bit drunk for some reason. - You've had a lot to drink. - Yeah, that's true. What should we do now? Let's just take a taxi. - I'll take the train. - It's fine, it's fine. It's okay, don't worry. No, where are we going? My place. We have good wine, let's drink some more. - I just want to go. - Don't tease me. You tempted me. - No. - Hey! hey! Wait a minute. Don't mess around. Don't act like High And mighty. The movie was really fun today, right? But that was an answer to before. Sorry. By the way, about the reply earlier... I can't short out my feelings. It's starting again. You can't ignore those innocent guys, They seems pitiful. Isn't it better to make her properly start a relationship? Should I introduce her to a guy? No, no, no, no! I can't just devour someone you know. But if we introduce you, Our credibility will definitely drop. That's true. But you know. You know those guys only try to seduce easy women, right? It's not a bad thing. After hearing that many guys like me... When my confidence is boosted, that's what matters. Does that kind of confidence really mean anything? Well, if Hiromi is okay with it, then it's fine, right? What do you even know about me? I know. That person is the reason. Step aside, seriously. Hey, don't run away. Even if you run from me, you can't escape from yourself. Annoying bastard, ugly sex maniac. Did you hear? "Annoying bastard, ugly sex maniac." Comfort me. Sorry. What are you doing? Seriously! You're all wet. My mom married the first guy she dated. - What's wrong? Come here. - I messed up. - What are you saying? Pow! - I messed up. Come here. You're all wet. Come along quickly. Follow me. Bring a mop. - Quickly, a mop. - Hiromi! What are you doing? Get up quickly. Stop it, stop it. Sorry. Don't do that to her. Where did you go? Where were you? Up until now. Tell me, pow. Where have you been? But he had control over us, both emotionally and financially. Mom. Mom is a stupid, right? I made you go through this. With a father like that, it's so pitiful. Thank you very much. With this, we will close today's business. - You've worked hard. - Oh, Mr. Misawa. Please inform the manager about the content of the fall festival next week. Yes. Left behind again. Somehow it's pitiful. They're still good enough eat. Then just exchange with the leftovers from the other stores. Oh, that's a good idea. Then we'll have to gather the inventory. Mr. Misawa, we're done here. Yeah. Yeah, I can have cake, I don't have to throw away Somai, it looks delicious. They are still delicious. Thank you. Enjoy your meal, everyone. What's this, such a kind person? Why are you staring off into space? Thank you. Even to leftovers, he's kind in his words. What could his name be? Cucumbers are delicious. - It's delicious. - I'm back. Welcome back. This goes well with beer. - The miso is Nagano. - What is that? - Hey, it's Siomai. - It's fine, give me some. - Let's eat - No, you can't. You lot, all messed up, don't deserve to eat. Huh? What did you say? 'You lot, all messed up, don't deserve to eat.' - Messed up? - Messed up? You've worked hard. Hey, can I borrow a lighter? Oh, sure. The cake shop... Shaomai shop.

Where are we going? - what? - Where are we going? - To a good place. - Tell me, seriously. - What? - You can hear everything. - I can't hear you. - Lier. pretty. I'm quitting my part-time job. I'm going to become a beautician. - I see. - Yes. And you? Are you planning to continue with your sales job? If I get the opportunity, I want to work as an illustrator. Since it's my dream. - An illustrator... - Yes. What kind of opportunity? Like winning a prize in some contest... Where are you participating now? Well, if you only talk about your dreams, They won't come true. Is that so? If you work hard from now on, you can make it, right? Hiromi can definitely make it. I guarantee it. The power isn't working. Are you serious? It's been cut off. Wait! Isn't it embarrassing to drink water in the park? Stop it. - Why? - Stop it. There's tap water there, so it's obvious to drink it. Mr. Ando? Did you buy these clothes at Shimazaki's? Shimazaki is cheap, so it's totally worth it. i know, i know, i know. I really like Shimazaki too. - Really? - Yeah. so? - Is it a new one? - I bought it. Why did you buy it when you have no money? Fool. It's your special helmet, so you should be happy. Hiromi, I have fun when I'm with you. - Huh? What did you say - You can hear everything. Ando might seem foolish, but he issomeone who didn't pretend. - Say it again. - I won't say it anymore. It smells really good. What is it? Hotpot. Wow, it looks good. Right? It's done now. - It's here. - Huh? So, what happened between you and that guy? What do you mean by "what happened"? Did you confess? I wouldn't confess first or anything like that. What? But that guy got a job at a beauty salon? That's a great opportunity. Until the he confess, I won't say a word. You doesn't express your feelings properly. Speak properly now. What do you think of me? A famous girl who's always surrounded by admirers. - Well, eat up. - It looks delicious. - I'll eat. - Yes. It's delicious. - By the way, Hiromi... - Yeah? You're not hiding your true nature, are you? Oh my, did that hit a nerve? Oh my? Oh, that's not good. You love being pampered and adored! Keeping up with the act of being a man, but a woman... What if that guy finds out? Isn't that a big problem? Huh? Did I hit a sore spot? What kind of spaghetti would you like? If it's creamy pasta, I'll eat anything. Creamy? Do you make it yourself? - I don't make it much myself. - So, you don't make it. I haven't made it recently either. I used to make it diligently before. Probably because I'm busy. I'm practicing too Though I'm but busy. - I see. - That's right. You're working hard. To become an illustrator quickly, what should I do? The Digital Ultra Academy. Yeah, this one. Digital Ultra Academy,' a school you can attend while working. It's really good. Koji, I'll borrow your bike. - Where are you going? - to apply. - To the academy? - I'll be back. Yeah, have a good time. - Be careful. - Sure. It's great. I'll change myself. So that I can be equal with Ando. You've put in a lot of effort. - By the way, when is the next one? - When is the next one... You misinterpreted it.

What are you doing, hurry up and drink, it'll calm you down. You guys, really. Dependent on men too much. What are you talking about? I'm not dependent on men or anything like that. Don't treat me like you do with her. You guys are always trying to fill your gaps with men. Because you lack confidence in yourselves. Stop running away from men.

Alright, I get it. Alright, I'll ask you one last thing. How many women have you been with, Mr. Misawa? what? I'm asking how many women you've been with. Well... sorry. I can't remember. Doesn't the fact that you can't say it mean that you had been with many? No, it's not like that. - To that extent, - You did it. Why didn't you think, That the you'll meet woman of destiny in future Would hate it? Such a mess... In short, you don't care about me, do you? No, why does it end up like this? - The conversation leaps... - Why? Because I'm your Woman of destiny, that's why. Why make it difficult then? I've never made it difficult. It's terrible, I don't know now. I'm not wrong. Saying you've been with another woman Is what's wrong. If we go by the number of men, You're the same, aren't you? I'm different, I haven't had sex. Hiromi. Still, you've made a lot of men Fall for you. Mr. Misawa, he knew I was that kind of woman. - I'm not wrong. - Hiromi. What? Here. I never knew I could be this happy.

Being with Ms. Arai right now makes me start to dislike her. - No, don't start hate me. - No, I mean. - Wait a minute. - Please don't hate me. - I'm here. - Please, I'm begging you. Ms. Arai. Listen to me properly. Ms. Arai, you know When you're in a good mood, You're really joyful and amazing. But when something bothers you, You completely... changes to an extent that's shocking. Of course, everyone experiences ups and downs in their emotions, but Revealing your true nature That's... Love. I thought I understood and accepted it, but... But this... Could it be That it's not love? How much distance are we talking about? How long? One month. Let's meet again in one month And decide what to do.

They said they need a family signature. It's alright. You can write slowly, just make sure it's accurate. It looks exactly like my handwriting. I told you to buy it. Why didn't you buy it, huh? Why didn't you think That the woman of destiny In future you'll meet Would hate it? That incomprehensible anger, Getting angry on my own, I'm just like my dad, who's going to suffer. Add this to it. Can I take it even if it's wrinkled? It's going to be difficult. Thank you. Thank you so much. - It's okay. - Thank you. When it's time to apologize, you don't, But for yourself, you can bow your head as much as you want. - I'm leaving now. - Sure. Th-thank you. I inherited that human blood. I don't want to feel anything. It would be great if things could stay like this and not arrive anywhere, right? There's been no contact from Mr. Misawa. Hiromi, are you hungry? - Ms. Arai - Yes. In the next contest planning department... If my parents had a good relationship And loved each other, Could I have loved myself a little more? Could I have avoided Harming anyone?
