Here is the beach view, interesting right? What's not interesting is this guy right here. This fat dude called Aiman. He likes to look at the sea and he's still single. Want to know why? Look at this. That's enough, Parjo. Why do you like sea-viewing? I miss the sea. That's enough. Let's go, Mr. Maznan called us for a meeting. What are you doing with the phone? I'm an Instafamous. Of course I need to update my Instagram. Enough, let's go. Hey pudgy, hurry up! This one is Jane. She is cute, but she doesn't realise it. She seems scary but has kind heart. She likes Aiman. But she is currently in the friend zone. Hey, stalker. Hi, Jane. No need to record. Geez, I want to upload it on my IG story. The love story of my two colleagues. Yeah right. Hurry up, Mr. Maznan called us for a meeting. Will Aiman be there too? Yes, of course he'll be there. I know you're ecstatic. Security team, please make sure the buses are parked at the space provided. Copy. Hey! When are we having a battle? Can you put on some clothes? It's annoying. MC is a lifeguard. No need to wear clothes. Then why are you wearing pants? When are we having a battle? You guys are acting like kids. Let's go, Mr. Maznan is calling us. He got something to tell us. Coward! Hello, hi. Hi! Jasmine Suraya Chin? Yes, I am. I want to check in. Sure. Can I get your IC? Oh! IC. IC... My IC. Thank you. You guys are terrible. I'm sorry, Miss. Woah! Jasmine Suraya Chin! Can I get a selfie with you? Selfie? Miss...miss...miss Your room key. Okay. Do you need me to take your bag? It's okay. I can take it. Enjoy your stay. Enjoy...enjoy...enjoy Wak, let's go. Mr. Maznan is calling for a meeting. Now? Yes, now. Hi. Hi, handsome. Wow! How do you know my name? You are? Jasmine. Jasmine. Yes. I love it. I can show you the world. And what's your name? I'm Josh. You can call me Joshua if you want. Hi. Hi, Jasmine. Anyway, call me. That's Jasmine Suraya Chin. Yes, pretty lady. Hey. Do you remember the money you owe me? The three hundred ringgit you used to buy a ring for your girl. You haven't pay me back. Bro, that was so long ago. What? But I'm out of money. When are you paying it back? Next week. Mr. Maznan called for a meeting. Oh, let's go. Oh, let's go. Mr. Maznan. MC doesn't understand why we have to stand like this? We're not soldiers. I know. Maybe he didn't pass his soldier test previously. I don't think so. He is the fans of soldiers. Why are you all here? Because you called for us. No! Why are all of you here? We're here to work, sir? No! You are all here because you need to provide the best service to our guests at Bayu Bay Hotel. We need to maintain our five-star status. There are plenty of hotels around us. We need to make sure that ours is the best. Tip-top. Recently, we received complaints saying that our English language is not the best. Especially all of you. Aiman Yes, Mr. Maznan. Miss Emma Waterstone from London said, I asked for pepper but what I got was paper. Aiman Do you know what a pepper is? A newspaper? Black pepper, Aiman! This is Tengku Iskandar. He will be our new mission. His father used to come to our hotel all the time. And his father was also the one who gave us the five-star rating. In two more days, he will be here. So please do not tarnish the hotel's image. Okay, Jane? Yes, Mr. Maznan. You got A1 in English, right? Yes, Mr. Maznan. So I want you to tutor everyone else here. Why do I have to do it? If I have to do everything then what's the point of having a meeting? I heard this before. I can't ask Aiman to do it. Aiman What did you get for your English? Erm... Did I get a D? Or was it E…F? Shhh. Of course, Mr Maznan. I'll do it. Thus, we have to make sure that our five-star hotel is the best. No problem, boss. We can do this. Five-star! There is nothing to worry about, boss. Okay, guys… Listen. When I say "five-star" you say, "Yeah!" Got it? Five-star! Yeah! Five-star! Yeah! Five-star! Yeah! Five-star! Yeah! Hurry up, guys! You guys are like girls. What time is it now? Can you move over? You're taking up space. Annoying! This girl… Hi, Jane. They played the same song every night? Isn't it boring? I know right? Right? What letter is that? This is… Jane, what time will the class start? I'm waiting for you guys. Are you done? Jane, what does MC need to learn? MC is a lifeguard. I only need to know "Help". Clever. MC, I'm just a kitchen staff. Why do I have to teach? But Mr. Maznan asked me to. Hey. When I say "English", you say "yeah!" Yeah! Let's go! How rude! Jane. Have you confessed to Aiman yet? How dare you asked me that? How am I supposed to confess if you keep getting in the way? When? When? You don't remember? Six months ago… Jane Aiman What is the important thing you need to tell me? Erm... Actually… We have known each other for quite some time… So, I already treat you as… I already see you as someone special. What happened? It's broken? After that you reported to Mr. Maznan. Of course. You're not kitchen staff, You can't use the stuff in the kitchen. But Mr. Maznan also cooked there. That's not the point. Anyway… You have ruined my plan to confess to him. Just once. Just once. Weih, Aiman. You like to watch the sea? I can't keep this anymore I need to tell you that… Help! Help! Oh no, Parjo is drowning! My leg! My leg! Just let him drown. Help! Help! Why is it so hard for him to know that I like him? Aiman! There are a lot of hot babes at the pool. Pool? Hurry up, they're waiting for us. Sis Jane. Keep fighting! Go, go, go! Thanks girls. Keep fighting! Okay, class. Repeat after me. Repeat after me. How can I help you, sir? How can I help you, sir? Can I take your order, sir? Can I take your order, sir? Aiman, if it is a female guest, how are you going to say this? Can I take your order, woman? Ma'am. Oh, ma'am. Anyway It's a good mistake, Aiman. Parjo Yes? Is everything okay with your room, sir? Everything is okay ma'am. Why? Why? Jane Yes, Mr. Maznan. I want to test someone. Go ahead. Parjo. Yes? Let's do a role play, okay? I'll be a lost guest. Okay? Okay? Excuse me. I'm lost. I want to get to swimming pool from the lobby. Can you show me the way? Please don't touch me, sir. You're from the lobby, right? How do you say this direction? This road. You take this road, until you see a café on your right, and then you can see a pool on your left, sir. Of course, A+. Jane, you can continue. Not bad, but still need  practice. Thank you, teacher. This is not a school. There is no bell. Sit. There's a ring just now. Sit down! Teacher. MC sleeps, teacher. I am sleepy. Teacher also sleepy! Quiet! So, this is your homework. When do we need to send this in, teacher? We will go through it in our next class, okay? Well done, you guys. Thank you, teacher. Jane Yes? Are we on tonight? Yes. Let's go. Come here. I have something for you. What's this? A cake, of course! You've never seen a cake? Can I try some? I made this for you. Your cake is always the best. Whoever marries you will be so lucky. You can be the lucky one if you marry me. Also Aiman, We've known each other for a long time. Are you serious? I'm kidding, of course! How can I be serious? I knew it. Us, getting married? I'm taking this cake home. I want to share with Parjo and the others. Thanks, Jane. Thank you. You're welcome. Parjo! Did you know that you have made our floor wet? But it's worth it. I'll update my Instagram later. Stop pranking people. Look! Look! He's a bad guy. Look, Parjo. No need to call him. He's not into this. I'll just entertain him. Parjo You're the only one in this hotel that MC can talk about wrestling with. No one else. You are MC's only hope. What's in the container? Jane's cake. You attacked Jane? - Her cake. Go to sleep. Eat up. Jane Why are you eating like that? When will you date Jane? Couple? Couple? You're crazy. Huh? I'm crazy? You can't be picky. With your tummy, no other girls will want you. It's not going to work. She's too boyish. I have known her for very long. Best friends can't date. Which law says that? I told you he's evil! You still keep that? That old necklace. I don't know where to put it. Gosh… I already told you Don't keep that necklace in this house. What if Yop steals it? He's a gambler! A stinky gambler like him can do anything. What did you say? A stinky gambler. What's your problem? Hey, come on. It's not worth to argue. How can a head security like him commit theft? You don't make sense. Not yet. But he owes money to everyone in the hotel. You want to see Who is the best fighter tonight? Yes! Yes! Yes! Stop fighting. Okay. We settle it our way. How is that? You go wash that thing! Headache! Help! Help! Hi, Jane. Hi, girls. Josh I have something to discuss. Okay! Jane, Aiman brought us the cake that you baked. Delicious! Does he like it? Be patient, Jane. You will get him one day. Good things come to those who wait. What's that? These are the guests' lost items. What are you going to do with that? I want to find something good to pick up girls. There's this one time I saw a dress that's your size. Do you want it? It's gorgeous. Josh, stop it! You shouldn't take other people's stuff. They shouldn't be so careless. What's that? Wow, Jane! I need to give an answer by this week at the latest. Then give an answer. I know. You have two dreams. One, is to be a chef at Taurus Cruise. Two, is to win the heart of The Bachelor. Enough, Josh. Now's not the time to be cheesy. Okay. So? Aiman is also a problem. I'll help you out. Let's go! Where are we going? - Just come. Josh? -Come. Nice to see you again, sir. Welcome, Dato'. Aiman Fuad. Is that really you? It is good to be back. Dato', later I'll ask Parjo… It's fine. I'm familiar with this hotel. Ouch! I keep forgetting that he's blind. Even though he's blind, he's very high spirited. Shouldn't we help him? No need. He also has huge ego. What are you going to tell him, Josh? Just forget about it. Don't worry. Aiman. I have a question to ask. What's with him? Just hear him out. Are you gay? No. Okay, good. That means you like girls. What are the characteristics of your dream girl? I don't really care as long as it's a woman. Are you saying you like all the women in the world? What about Jane? She's kind, cute, fluent in English. You're not attracted to her? Jane is impossible. She's my best friend. It's different. So? Is she that ugly to you? She's not ugly. I don’t know. Okay, fine. What are the physical characteristics of your dream girl? I'm sure you have some. Characteristics of my dream girl? I want her to have… Long hair. Something Jane's hair length is good enough. Okay. Also, I would like her to be tall. As long as she looks tall. But most importantly I want her to have fair skin. It will turn red with one slap. You are naughty… Like her? Stupid Josh. Hi, are there any available rooms? Hi. May I know under whose name did you make your booking? Sorry, I don't speak Malay. Oh, sorry. Your booking is under whose name? That's the thing. I don't have any booking. It's okay. Can I have your ID, please? Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Boss. If I'm not mistaken, these people are influencers. They give reviews on the hotels they stay at.

No. Can I ask you something? Have you ever fallen in love? That's so sudden. You just walked with the girl and you think you're falling in love? That's funny. I don't know how to say this. But when I'm with her, I can feel a strong "confession". Connection. Ah, connection. I forgot how to say it just now. Hey. This is too fast. You hang out with me by the beach for five years. But you never fell for me. Well, you're different, Jane. She's different. You don’t understand. It's hard explaining it to you. Can you help me out? Help out with what? Teach me how to "skip", so that I can talk to Sofia. Oh. She has a name. Why don't you ask her to teach you how to "speak"? That's true. But she doesn’t know how to speak Malay language. Where are you going, Jane? Aiman. Oh! Ouch! Do you have a lotion? My sunburn is terrible. What are you looking at? MC doesn’t think that he is staying at our hotel. Really? I have never seen him at the swimming pool. Maybe he doesn't like to go to the swimming pool. Bro. All the guys who came to our hotel will go to the swimming pool, bro. Okay, let's check up on him. Okay. Hello? What are you doing here? Why do you need to know? MC needs to know. Who? MC. Who is MC? MC. MC needs to know. Sir, what are you doing here? It's up to me. This is a private area.

Finally, I get to confess to him. Go! Go! Go! Wait, what if you get rejected? Huh? What if he rejects you? He won't reject me. Because I've seen many romantic films, if the girl confesses, the guy never rejects. He will always accept the girl. Sis Jane, this is not a romantic film. And there's only one person in this world who never gets rejected. Who? Fazura If he rejects me, then I'll go work at Torres Cruise. Aiman is stupid. But I hope… that Aiman is not that stupid. Yes! When you get married, I will give you a great speech. If I could, I would like to sing a song. Thank you, Vee. Thank you, Zain. Is "Belaian Jiwa", okay? Or you prefer, Siti Nurhaliza? Sheila Majid? Hi, girls. Still single? Oh, please. With your side-swept hair, not a chance. Hi. Feisty. I like. Parjo, I am leaving. Today is special for me, is that okay? Bye. Alright, I am going down in a while. Aiman. Eh, Jane. You look handsome. You're ready? Let's go. Was it today? Yes, it's today. Today is my birthday. Oh no. Erm… I... I have something to do. Why so sudden? Yesterday, you were okay with it. Geez. There's no need to surprise me. I know. If not, you wouldn’t have dressed up like this. Erm... I have a dinner with Sofia. Let's do it tomorrow? Also, I'm used to having a meal with you. But this is a hot babe. She likes me. That's enough, Aiman. Hurry up and go. You don’t want to keep Sofia waiting. Okay. I'll go first. Thank you. I love you forever. Why are you so shy? Is it good? It's really good. Sofia. I don't care who you are, where you're from, what you did, as long... Wait, is that from a song? Oh no, she knows. So... So? Oh. Can you wait here? What? Wait! Wait! Wait! Okay? Okay. Hey, a hand. Mr. Aiman. Are you really going to give that necklace to Sofia? I think she's the one. Hashtag #poorJane. Something in your ear. Magic? Oh my God. Oh. Oh, you... Oh yeah? My nipples are pierced. Yeah, you know what that means. It was literally like...she was a sex addict. Leave us. Why the long face? Hmm? You were dumped by that flirtatious woman? Ah... All women are the same. What do you mean? They only want rich men. That's the only thing they see in a man. Yeah, right. Not all women are like that. Stop it, Jane. If Tengku Iskandar goes after you, you would be all over him too. I know. All over him? Is that what you think of me? You think I'm all over you. Right? Relax, Jane. I can't relax, Aiman. I thought you just walk slow. But turns out you're really a slowpoke. You still don’t realise? Don’t you see, Aiman? What's with you? I'm tired of telling you. I'm tired of telling you that I like you. I like you, you moron! But you like that flirty vixen. And when that girl does something bad, you put me on the same level as her. Jane. You know what's sadder? Today is my birthday, you jerk. There's one more thing I need to tell you. It's better if you don’t know… Jane. MC, what do you think he's doing with that boat? MC thinks he is stealing the boat. Huh? What is he doing with the boat? Why are you here? MC not so sure. Only one way to find out. Hey! Hey! What are you doing with this boat? Mind your own business. Are you stealing the boat? No, I'm not. Where is your road tax? Why asking for road tax? Because I only ride motorbikes. When the police stop me, he asked for road tax. If no road tax, means that the bike was stolen. But this is not a bike. It's a motorboat. Tell us the truth. What are you doing with this boat? I already told you. Mind your own business. You always say that. Eh. I can do whatever I want to do. So nobody can stop me. See ya! Eh! How do I reply him in English? I hate English! Everything in English, English! English! Everything needs to be in English. What? I can't succeed without English? I can't like a girl? Everything is wrong! Do I have no future without English? Everything I do is wrong! Calm down. Enough! The boat is innocent. Shut up you! I can't do anything. Everything is wrong. What is wrong with me? You think fat people have no feelings? English! All about English! Yes? Hi. I want to see Sofia. Now is not the time. No! Sofia! How could you do this to Aiman? Connecting room? Sorry, wrong room. Yeah. We made a request upon check in. We're going to die. What do you think he is going to do with the boat? Where is Yop? Huh? Call Yop, ask him to gather the security... and look for the wretched guy. And you, Aiman. Why did you tear down the boat? I'm sorry, Mr. Maznan. He was heartbroken, boss! And then, he was scolded by Jane. How did you know? I'm guessing. I don’t know what's wrong with her tonight. She scolded me and then, confessed to me. Hey. You are such a simple and slow-minded doofus. How can you not know that she likes you? We don't need to Google, everyone here already knows that. Hey! Did you know that she got an offer to work at Taurus Cruise? Taurus Cruise? Oh no, I accidentally told the boss. She didn’t tell you? Nope… Oh dear… Hey! Let him be. MC has a cousin. Who looks like Janna Nick. But she's a glutton. You never tell me that. You're handsome. I know right? Sofia! There are so many guests downstairs, Sofia. All these guns are not real, right? What's that? Firecrackers? Over there! Tengku! Jane! SME? Oh my God he's dead! What's the matter with you? Stop killing people! "Two Tangos." Down! One down. Oh God! I dont't want to die yet. Jet! Engine down! Scan! Sofia you BEACH. Aiman. So what's the plan now? We'll get back to the room. Be aware! They know we're here. Let's go! Oh my god. “Contact!” Formation two. Reload! Up! Why is everyone shooting? Reload! Reload! Up! Move! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Oh my god, he is dead. He made coffee for me yesterday. What is happening? They are here. Aiman, are you okay? Why is it so messy? There's a gunfire upstairs. Oh! No! My five-star! Oh, my five-star. No! No! No! What is going on? The SME babes are evil. That's right. They were shooting people. We need to save our hotel guests. It's okay. Let the security handles it. Parjo, there's no need to show your followers what's happening. Come here. Did you see? They kidnapped Jane. What do we do now? Yop, hurry up and go to the radio room and call the police. Faster! Okay. I have a plan. We stay safe and wait for the police to arrive. How about Jane? We need to save Jane. We need to wait for the police to save Jane, right? Hello? Hello. Aiman. Sofia? Yeah, it's me. Hey you! You take out Jane, you get down Jane. What? What is let go in English? Release, release Jane. That's why I ask you to learn but you keep playing around. Release. You release Jane. Well, I'm not sure about that. If you want Jane, I have two requests from you. I don’t understand. Hi, can you please repeat? Alright, guys. Here are what Sofia requested. Firstly, don't call the police. Secondly, she wants a boat. Just give her the boat. After she reaches the other side, we'll let the police handles them. We can't! Why? Jane is with her. We need to do something. No, we can't. She has a machine gun. Technically, she's using HK416 -And Glock 17. Eh! How did you guys know about these weapons? Were you in military before? All of this is you girlfriend's fault. No. She's just an ex. Now we need to focus on Jane. That's our responsibility. And now, I have a plan. Okay. For the sake of Jane's cake. For the sake of Jane's cake. For the sake of Jane's cake. Oh yes! My friend. Yop had called the police. While we are waiting for the police, we have to delay them. But, the most important things are, we have to save Jane. Do we need to sort it according to colors? You're so weird. Supper. Come in. Aiman! Jane! Thank you, Aiman. Your girlfriend will be fine, as long as you follow our instruction. Jane. She is your girlfriend, right? Yes. I'm your girlfriend now? Jane! Now is not the time. He speaks English. What's going on? Oh, we are kidnapped. That's fine. Or I can just kill the both of you. Oh god, gun. Walk. Okay, okay. Tell her to be soft, it's painful. Show me the boat. -Huh? Boat! There, there. The engine is working now. Bring me to the boat. Be a good boy or I will shoot her. Okay, okay. Left clear. - Right clear. Move! Stop! Sorry, I'm nervous. Aiman, move. Move. That's sharp. That's sharp. That's sharp. Where is he going? Where is he going? Is he lost? Shoot the eyes. Sofia. Now! Scan! Hold fire! Gasoline. Let's go get them. That is scary. Shh... We're going to die. We're going to die. Shut up! Parjo, follow the plan. Okay. Let's go. How come I don't know? What are we going to do? - Let's go. You gonna protect me. -I'll protect you. There! Maria straight, Emelia with me. Go down! Go down! Hurry up! Faster, Aiman! Faster! What's wrong? I've told you to jog but you don’t want to. Let's go. Now, I want both of you to please follow me. Not so fast. Boss! You too, not so fast. Who is that? Emelia. You're not fast. No! Don’t move. Yes! You don’t move. How many knives do we have? You don’t move. Wak! Yes! One, two, three. We won! We won! We won! They're out of people. Matching your face. Who says? Hey, hey! What are you doing, Yop? You traitor! Traitors will pay! Nobody moves! I can't see you, but I can hear you. Yop, how could you do this to us? I treated you as my own child. How could you, Yop? How could you? I've worked here for three years, and you've never raised my salary. Where will you run? We already called the police. Who did you ask to call just now? You! Did you think I call? Why didn’t you? Why indeed. I hate you! MC thought MC was your friend Friend? You always try to pick a fight with me. Stinky gambler! What is it? How much did they pay you? A lot. Quite a lot. Yop! What have you done, Yop? I have done a lot. That's why all this happened. If you could get us room 657. Like me. 'Target will appear in restuarant tonight.' Aiman. Enough! Just kill them all. Problem solved. Yeah man, let's grab the package and go. Yes! Kill them all! No, no, no, no! No killing. We… Have Tengku Iskandar. You... No, no! Where is Tengku Iskandar? Parjo, where are you? Yop. I'm at assembly Point C with Tengku. Where are you? Okay, I'm on my way. Let's go! You, come with us. Okay. What did she say? Are you stupid or what? He is fat! He's going to slow you down. Take me instead. Alright! Take her. What did you say? Hey! Don’t take her! I love you! You would be the lucky one if you marry me. Are you serious? I'm tired of telling you that I like you. You're hurting me. -Diam. Slow down. You're hurting me. What is this? I have no idea. Be careful. Don't underestimate them. Yop, you good? One iced coffee. What the...? Where's Jane? Jet, go get her! Yop, let's proceed. Okay! What are supposed to do now? All of this is Mr. Maznan's fault. Why me? If you raise Yop's salary, he wouldn't become like this. His salary is quite high, okay. I pay him four thousand a month. What? My salary is only two thousand and seven hundred. MC only got three thousand. Three thousand? My basic salary is only two thousand five hundred. How did Yop get four thousand? This is not logical, boss. Josh, what do you mean two thousand five hundred? I pay you found thousand as well. Josh! Four thousand! I'm scared that you guys will know my salary. Why is this world so unfair? This is all my fault. I was blind. Jane really does care about me. I never appreciate her. Don’t worry, Arman. Aiman. The blood is thicker than  water. If this is my destiny, and the best for her. After this, I will cherish every single moment I have with her. So that we can have beautiful memories together. Aiman, listen here. I have fallen in love with this one person. It's an old story, Around twenty years ago, I was working on a cruise ship. Taurus Cruise. I was only a crewmember. I got to know her when she board the cruise for the first time. She comes from a rich family, while I am only a poor boy. I worked at the lower deck. When I saw her for the first time, I was enamoured. I fell in love with her. But fate wanted to test our love. The ship that we're on was about to sink. We both worked hard to save ourselves. Mr. Maznan, wasn't that the story of "Titanic?" Yeah, it sounds the same. You guys, I'm trying to tell Aiman the story. Previously, you told me that when you were young you worked as a taxi driver in KL. You guys are the worst! Suddenly he turns into Jack. I understood what Mr. Maznan tried to convey. It doesn’t matter if it's from the "Titanic" film. What? That we'll sink together? No! If we sit here and cry, we won't be able to save our memories. I will save my love. Hey, are you serious? I forgot. Terrible. Guys! Don't we need to tell him? I can still hear you. Parjo, I'm here. Where are you? I'm almost here. Oh, the brain type? You'll protect me, right? Girl. I know you are in here. Come to papa. Miss me! Sorry. I am not on purpose. Aiman, are you okay? I'm fine. Okay. Are you okay? I'm okay. Jane. What is it? About you… Liking me, is that true? Huh I told you so many times already, Aiman. You really like me? Aiman. Of course it is. I wouldn’t joke about this… I like you too, Jane. Erm... Why don’t we save our friends first? Why don’t we tie him up? He deserves it. -Go die. Oh, handsome Josh. I've got this. You sure? He's just a hotel worker, what can he do? Okay, meet us at the beach ASAP. Go. Hey! Sorry, sorry! Ah! Papa! Mama! Oh yes! Wak, hurry up! Papa! Mama! Younger brother! Elder sister! Elder brother! Be water, my friend. No need to act tough. It hurts so much! Stop being so rough. Go, Maznan. Go, Maznan. Go. Why do you have to be so rough? Hey you! Leave Tengku and you all can go. I will take care of him. Be quick. Bye Mr. Maznan. What? Mr. Maznan? You really think you can fight me with that? I'm using protection. All my life, I've been using protection. Understand? This is useless. You piece of s... Thank you, God. Hurry up! What are you saying, man? Yop! If you dare, don’t run. You go first. I got this. Be quick, we don't have all night. See you in a while. Ah, guys. Are you just gonna let her take me? Guys! There are two of you. This is like gambling, it's never fair. Tonight we will see who the best fighter is. Good. I haven't karated anyone in a while. Ah! It's dark in here! I feel dizzy! Hey! You can't beat me! If you smell what The Rock is cooking! One, two, three. We are the champion! The boat is not fixed. Yes, so what? So you guys are here to stop me? Yes. It's two against one. Now it's three against one, and we're gonna beat you up. Alright, let's see if you guys can fight. Feel my right hand! Oops! My fat is almost gone. I will teach you a lesson! Did she slap me? She come! She come! She bang! Oh my God. Go! Go! Oh my God. Oh, man. Let's go. Let's go. You done? Oh man, it hurts. Tengku I'm so sleepy. Grenade! This time, you go. Aiman! It's just smoke. Wrong grenade. Damn it Aiman! Aiman, are you okay? Hurry up! Okay, okay. Tie her up! She's moving again. Tie her up! Take that, Sofia! I'm still alive, Jane. Okay, we can call the police now. Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for coming to our special party.
