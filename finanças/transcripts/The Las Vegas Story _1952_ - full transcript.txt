"Yes. It's Clark County, Nevada." "Folks who live here think it's bigger than the state of Texas." "But it ain't." "Excepting for folks around here, nobody knows much about Clark County, Nevada." "But say 'Las Vegas' anywhere in the world and folks prick up their ears." "And the lucky ones can remember picking up some money." "Or dropping some." "Along with last year's wife." "But you can't say Las Vegas .." "Without including Clark County because they go together." "Like whiskey and soda." "Win and lose." "Linda and Dave." "But I am getting ahead of myself." "My name is Happy. And I am." "This is me here at the piano in The Last Chance." "I've been working here for years." "It's not the best place in Vegas but it is a long way downwind from the worst." "Oh yes. This Linda I mentioned." "And stood right alongside me." "This fellow Dave." "Well, he was a Sergeant out at the airbase." "And he used to come down here every chance he got." "He always sat over there listening to the girls sing." "But what they did when she wasn't singing I never asked." "Because my business is just sitting here pounding on the old 88." "But this is a sudden town and something sudden must have happened to them." "I never did get the straight of it." "But I think of them now and then when I play a certain song." What are you doing? Counting telephone poles? Cactus. The porter woke me with your wire. He found me behind a double scotch. The news is wonderful. They don't need me in Los Angeles until next week. Fine. Let's spend some time in Palm Springs. What do you say we celebrate? We'll be in Las Vegas in 15 minutes. So we'll drink a toast to the place and toss the bottle out of the window. I have a much better idea. We'll get off and toss the bottle back on the train. With a note in it. 'To whom it may concern. Mr and Mrs Rollins have divorced Los Angeles ..' 'For a brief holiday in Las Vegas'. Short and to the point. I can make it shorter. I have always been curious. What have you got against Vegas? I just don't like the place. That's all. Not good enough. Let's say you lived there too long. You're afraid of going back and running into yourself, aren't you? Maybe. I might meet a total stranger. Linda, I know you pretty well and I've filled in most of the gaps. There is only one part missing. I think it's Vegas. You like running risks, don't you Lloyd. With a woman like you a man always runs risks. Thank you, sir. Hold it, porter. - But we're moving out. You go to Los Angeles. - See my luggage gets back here. Yes, sir. A cab, sir? - Yes please. Which hotel? - The Fabulous. An excellent choice. Excuse me, lady. Didn't you used to sing here in Vegas? - I used to sing all over. I never forget a face. That man obviously has no eye for figures. We have more luggage at the station. Would you take care of it for us? Certainly. Will the penthouse be satisfactory? - I think we can struggle along with it. Whom do I see about establishing credit? - Mr Martin, our credit manager. Mr Martin, I am Lloyd Rollins. Mrs Rollins and I came for a holiday. I need some help to establish credit. Of course, Mr Rollins. Any specific amount? Anything up to a hundred thousand. - I'd say that's specific enough. You can check on me with Chase National or Dun And Bradstreet. Rollins Bond & Mortgage New York. Will early tomorrow do, Mr Rollins? - Thanks. We can squeeze by until then. The casino is open all night, isn't it? We never close. And seldom sleep. Excellent. That suits me perfectly. Let's go and freshen up, shall we? Would you put this away for me? - No, darling. Your pretty things should be seen and not put into solitary confinement. A single, sir? - Anything with a bed in it. There you go. - Thanks. Don't fall in love with the view, Linda. Let's get rolling. And wear your necklace. I want to burst in on then like a million dollars. I thought a hundred thousand was your limit. There's no ceiling on you, darling. Don't you think you'd better put a ceiling on your gambling? A hundred thousand is quite a high roof. - It's alright. I'll win. And don't confuse me with lady luck. I've been here before you know. Well, I am not worried. I still have my rabbit's foot. Be sure you wash it behind the ears. Music to my ears. That's what everyone says until they get them chopped off. Mr Rollins, this is Mr Drucker, our managing director. Good evening. Mrs Rollins has been trying to tell me there's no such thing as luck. It's one thing the house can't furnish. Our guests have to bring it with them. My husband thinks he's loaded. - All I say is, don't bet against me. Personally, I never gamble. That is a nine. Six is the winning number. Busy for number six. Isn't this better than that Pullman? Now you'd be bouncing around in that berth and what would you get out of it? Eight hours sleep. - Take this chip. Pick your winning numbers. - Six. Come on. Blue seven. Seven away. You don't pass. New shooter coming up. - Give me those dice. You got a lucky pair. Coming out. Win or lose. Two ways to bet. Come on seven. Winner seven. Pay your line. Line win. Thank you. Coming out again, the same shooter. Win or lose. Coming out. Take your winning number. Eight will win. Come on eight. That is nine. Shooting for number 8. Eight is your winning number. - Eight. Eight. Come on, eight. Car 3. - "Go ahead, 3." I'm over at The Fabulous. I just saw the sheriff's car parked on Freemont. You'd better send someone over to tell him he's standing in a red zone. "10-4." Hi, Lieutenant. - What do you know, Mattie? Someone blew into town tonight. This is a windy town. People blow in, people blow out. That's what this doll did once. She used to sing at The Last Chance. What about her? The penthouse suite. If a man answers, hang up. You talk too much. Lieutenant. If you're looking for the blond cigarette girl who gave you free smokes. I fired her. - Good. She was bad for my throat. What else is eating you? - The usual thing. Bobby-soxers in the belfry. I told you not to build the wedding chapel. It tempts people to get married. - Well, take care of it, will you. Okay. I wonder who bought her that necklace. The high-roller next to her. He is her husband. Look, if you like the view so well .. Take care of the kids in the chapel and come back in your own time. Not me. I like my job. Chasing around in paddy wagons. Picking up young squirts who want to get married too soon. I am Lieutenant Andrews from the Sheriff's department. I hear you two kids want to get married. You got your license? Are you really 18, Mary? How about you, Bill? You really 21? Bill is going to be drafted in six weeks. Do your folks know about this? Whatever this is between me and Mary. We didn't ask you. You didn't ask your folks either. They wouldn't understand. - Why not? Because .. Because .. Because you're not 21 and Mary isn't 18. Isn't that it, Bill? If Bill is old enough to get drafted he is old enough to get married. Waiting is no good. It will be years before Bill gets back. Anything can happen. Another man maybe. - No, Bill. There are five thousand other marrying places in Nevada. Why did you two pick this one? I'd like to give you a break. But the law says no. Let's go. - Where to? Detention. I'll get you a bite to eat and then we'll get in touch with your folks. When did you first notice this about your husband? Notice it? He showed it to me. I guess he must have been like that before we were married. We were getting along swell. But when the psychiatrist moved in with us, well .. Hey, you are not listening. - I heard every word you said. I have a feeling I've interrupted a conversation between you and the desert. Is the past sneaking up on you? Lloyd, why don't you roll your dice and let me roll my own? I don't think you have the courage to roll your own dice. I don't think I know what you mean. Take a ride around town. When you find that old trunk with the memories in it, open it up. What do you think I'll find? - Who knows? Perhaps an old pair of dancing shoes. A broken piano key or a moth. If it's just a moth, buy it a drink. Is that the way you want it, Lloyd? - Of course. Go ahead. Get it out of your system. Alright. Thank you. "I get along without you very well." "Of course I do." "Except when soft dreams fall." "And drip from leaves. Then I recall .." "The thrill of being sheltered in your arms." "Of course I do." "But I get along without you very well." "I've forgotten you just as I should." "Of course I have." "Except to hear your name." "Or someone's laugh that is the same." "But I've forgotten you just as I should." "What a guy." "What a fool am I." "To think my breaking heart could kid the moon." "What's in store?" "Should I fall once more?" "No." "It's best that I stick to my tune." "I get along without you." "Very well." "Of course I do." "Except perhaps in spring." "But I should never think of spring." "For that would surely break my heart." Linda. Why, it is Linda. You weren't going to walk out on an old pal, were you? Happy, I wasn't walking out on you. How are you doing? You. You look fine. Good to see you. And wait until Mike sees you. Hey, Mike. Look who I have found. Linda. Welcome home. - Hello, Mike. This calls for a drink, Linda. - On the house? On the bar. It is all the same. I saw you coming, Miss Barns. - You're a doll, Henry. Keep your eyes on your work. Here's to the girls who haven't come back. Mike? - No. Ulcers. Tell us how you happened to get married, Linda. Yes. Deal, deal, deal. I was standing on 5th Avenue talking to a horse. When the bus hit me. And was that bus loaded. Fogarty. You forgot to tell your relief man you were leaving the floor. Sorry. An old chum just dropped in. You will be around for a few days, won't you Linda? Sure, Mike. She used to sing here. This is Mr Clayton the new owner, Linda. Linda. Mrs Rollins. How do you do. - How do you do. She does fine. Perhaps she will sing for us again. You look like you had a fine voice. Coming from him that's no compliment. How did Mike lose The Last Chance? Well, he borrowed from Peter to pay Pauline and Pauline was dating Clayton. The first thing you know, they closed him out. Mike having to work in the place he built. That is rough. - Having to work is rough. You know, hunger makes very strange bedfellows. And wouldn't you know. Mrs Rollins. If you want to talk to Happy, why not do it over at the piano? Can we take a hint? The man is asking for music. Come on, Happy. That's what I get for speaking out of turn. When are you going to ask me about Dave? When the cow jumps over the moon. Funny you should say that. You know that little sign down the road advertising The Blue Moon restaurant? Hmm. I was going home the other night .. And blamed if real cow didn't jump over the moon part of that sign. Alright. How is Dave? He is healthy. "I get along without you very well." Do you remember this? "Of course I do." "Except perhaps in spring." "But you should never think of spring." "Well, that would surely break my heart." "In two." Hello Dave. Hello Linda. Same old place. Same old table. Just like old times, isn't it. We can pretend. Which part of the old times is this? The part where you were supposed to come back and say goodbye? Before they shipped me out to the South Pacific. That was a misunderstanding. That explains that. But it's not very logical. Of course, logic has never bothered you too much anyway. David, look. I didn't come here to beef with you. I was real glad to see you at first. I had the same reaction. But I caught myself in time. You should have stayed over in the high rent district. You look better there. That high-roller at The Fabulous. Does he know you are out alone? But I am not alone. I have a man with me. Who? You. - Me? You are really mixed up. That was a long time ago. That guy was a chump. He believed if he left his hat or his girl at a table .. They'd be there when he came back. And I'm the kind of a chump who believed .. If two people were really in love they would kiss and make up. But you have to give a girl a chance. There's only so many chances and so many men. The supply must run out someday. Here we go again. - Not again, Linda. Once is enough. The only thing I am asking you is to keep out of my territory. David, this is horrible. I have wondered about you so often. Afraid everything would be just like old times if we saw each other again. Look. You've got everything you've always wanted. Whatever it is you came back to Vegas for .. Find it quick and get out. I have to live in this town. Hi, Dave. - Hiya. Is the sheriff in? He caught a fish. I didn't know you were going to Lake Mead today, Sheriff. Neither did this here fish. Otherwise he'd have skedaddled long before I got there. I caught me a prime trout, Dave. I don't know whether to mount him or eat him. I don't know what kind of an idea it gives you. But it gives me one. I like to go fishing. Think you should go and change your clothes first? Thanks. I will see you Thursday. Hey, wait a minute. A whole week to fish? I can't spare you that long. - I must get out of town for a few days. And I have the time coming to me. I don't want to sound like a sheriff, Dave. But with El Dorado Week coming on I need every man in the department. Okay. Pull me off the strip and put me on another detail. Nobody knows that strip like you do. Outside of myself. This is something personal. A woman? - Yep. A married one? - You are right again. I am never wrong. I can read character or hit a bullseye at fifty paces. Dave. I am not even looking at you. But I can tell from here. You are not going fishing. You didn't stop in at the casino on your way back. You didn't need me to help you carry away your losses, did you? That sounds like a bitter remark from a bitter woman. Did the lid of that trunk fall on your pretty fingers? Did it? Lloyd, let's get out of here. I have a much more practical idea. Let's sleep until noon and see how both our worlds look in the sunlight. Hello. I wonder if you would do me a favor. You name it. Find yourself another pool to swim in. What's the matter with this one? I think there is a sea monster in it. Really? I hadn't noticed. Then it's the first thing you've missed. What are you, a licensed peeping Tom? I am sorry. If I have offended you by admiring you I apologise. I know I've been staring. Is that your business? Staring at people? No. Actually, jewelry is my business. Especially pieces like that necklace you are wearing. The name is Tom Hubler. I have references. I've never been asked for references but I suppose I could get them. I'd say you already have plenty. You can jump back in the pool now. Here comes my husband. Hello darling. Lloyd, this is Mr Hubler. He has references. Hello. You're a very fortunate man. He admires my necklace. Naturally he does. I'll just check up on that sea monster. You know, they should drain that pool. It's crawling. Lloyd, why don't you tell me what's really going on? I am having fun, darling. Why don't you? I think it's something more than that. I understand from Mr Martin they have limited your credit to ten thousand. He's an idiot. An attitude like his can start a run on the bank of England. Lloyd. If there's something serious behind your gambling, I'd like to help. Those are brave words, darling. Well, I'm a brave girl. As a kid I used to run all the fellows off the block. Well, I won't ask you if they finally caught up with you. It is nice to be married to so much bravery. If things get tough I may have to tap it. [ Telephone ] Hello? It's long-distance, Lloyd. Boston. I don't want to speak to anybody in Boston. I am sorry. Mr Rollins isn't available at the moment. Hang up, Linda. Thank you. I'll tell him. A man's voice said to tell you Monty is dead. Monty? I don't place him. Didn't he sign that telegram you got on the train? Whoever Monty was, he committed suicide. And he did sign the telegram. Don't worry about my business associates, Linda. Living or dead, they are none of your concern. Don't be reading my mail. I will see you downstairs. Hello darling. - Lloyd, my necklace is missing. How stupid of me. I took it and forgot to tell you. Why? Too many people were admiring it. I felt it would be safer in the hotel vault. Well, hello. - I see they've drained the pool. Mr Rollins, I want to make amends for this afternoon. Just how do you propose doing that? - By dancing with your wife. Oh, fine. Mr Rollins. - Hello. Evening. Mr Hubler, my wife accepts your kind offer. Dance with him, Linda. I have some business with Mr Drucker. I said, dance with him. Sit down. Will you have a drink? - No thank you. You gave this to Mr Martin a few minutes ago. Yes. How much credit did you decide to extend me on it? None. It's worth $150,000. You don't have to take my word on it. I have an insurance appraisal up in my room if you'd like to see it. I am not interested. When you came here you asked for $100,000 credit. We have already advanced you $10,000. If I knew then what I know now. Well anyway, your wife makes a good impression. But it has run out. And so has your welcome. You imply that I am leaving. Do you intend to force me? Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that, Mr Rollins. It won't, Mr Drucker. Don't look so surprised. This place happens to be on my beat. It's real nice of you to look me up. Let's keep it official. Your husband is a tramp and Drucker wants him out of here in a hurry. He's really heading for trouble. I thought if I told you first we could get it over with quick and painless. Why not tell him yourself? Why not walk right up and say: 'your wife married the wrong man'. 'She kissed me off so get out of town'. That's the way you want to tell it, isn't it? Why not tell him the full story? It's all over now. I'm not so sure. Is it over, Linda? Isn't that what you came back here to find out? Isn't it? What a beautiful picture. Moonlight. Sagebrush. My wife with a stranger. An old friend. Ah, the desert is giving up its secrets. Lloyd, this is Lieutenant Andrews of the Sheriff's Office. My husband. I am a wizard at guessing names. 'Joe', isn't it? In the song it's always Joe. I can see you riding off to another dawn with the girl you left behind crying. 'Goodbye, Joe'. - Lloyd. You put it all together, Rollins. The only place you slipped up was about the tears. Your wife doesn't cry easy. And she didn't wait to say goodbye. Maybe if she had you wouldn't be standing here. But if you're looking for trouble with me, forget it. You've got your share already. Lloyd, we've got to get out of here. - First thing in the morning. Tell you what. Go and powder your nose and we'll drop in at The Last Chance. Well, I may as well meet your other old friends. And get a look at the scene of your innocent youth. Mr Rollins. It's you again. Well, what is it now? I represent the company insuring your wife's necklace. My job is to watch it. I didn't see it around tonight. - I resent the implication. Right now, you can make things a lot easier by cooperating. I just follow my company's instructions. - Alright, relax. It's in the hotel vault. No hard feelings. There is no reason for Mrs Rollins to know about .. Your company's interest in her jewelry. Is there? None whatsoever. - Thanks. Why don't you join us later for a drink? And bring your own girl. Hello, Mrs Rollins. - Hello. There you are, darling. - Have a good time. The Last Chance please. I can see from here anything could have happened in this place and probably did. Where is the baggage room? The one with the trunk in it. In there. That's Happy at the piano. What is missing? His sense of humor. I find very little here to laugh at. Good evening, Mrs Rollins. Lloyd, this is Mr Clayton. He owns the place. My husband. How do you do. - You wife worked here previously. But I've heard her sing. That's one of the things I've missed. May I buy you a drink? - That's very kind of you. Linda? Thank you. I think I'll go and say hello to Happy. Alright. I'll take our friend up on that drink. I can always talk to the piano player later. Well, you asked for it and here it is: The monkey song. Hello Linda. Gather round everybody. It's a story. About a monkey and a king. King Reebop. And his dream. Down in the jungle. He dreams about flowers. He dreams about a bird. No, not that one. Oh, that's a prettier bird. He also dreams about a monkey. He dreams this monkey can play the drums. That's a different monkey. The reason the king has this dream? He's broke. He needs dough. And there is a missionary. That's all. Mrs Rollins, I'd like a word with you. Sorry. This is my busy night. - It's mine too. I must ask you where your necklace is. Why don't you ask my husband? - I did. He said it was in the hotel vault. - Then you should be satisfied. Your husband is a liar, Mrs Rollins. It isn't there. Hello Linda. Look at that. I told you my luck would change. Come on, dice. Lloyd, I want to talk to you. - That is my point. Now is no time for talk. But maybe you'd better run along. You said it yourself, remember? That you weren't lady luck. Come on. Come on, dice. You be my lucky lady. Come on. How much did Clayton give my husband on the necklace? Ten thousand dollars, Linda. I see you didn't take my advice. Occasionally I am right. I am in no mood for your bragging. Come on, come on. Eleven the winner. Why don't you come out into the night air and cool off? Monkey see. Monkey do. "Car 3. Car 3." Car 3. Go ahead. "Dave. The parents of that girl are here." "There's nobody around to clear them. What will we do?" Car 3. I'm on my way in. You might find this very interesting. They're in the chief's office, Dave. - You have the release papers? Here. - Thanks. I am Lieutenant Andrews. Are these your folks, Mary? Well, have you all talked it over? We know what is best for Mary. Dad, you don't know. Only Bill and I know what this means. Don't, Mary. Do you have anything to say, Bill? Now is the time to say it. - I've already said my piece. And nobody listens. Do you realise that Bill is going to be drafted in six weeks? If he gets in the army Mary will forget all about him. Anyway, waiting will do them good. Sometimes waiting is not good. I am only telling you this because these kids may have a long wait. I just want you to understand it as well as they do. I wish you'd sign the release papers, Lieutenant. We have a long drive home. Well. This will go into the files along with a lot of other heartbreaks. They could have walked across the street and been married. And all it needs is your signature. Where do I sign? Right under the place where it says .. 'I wouldn't give a couple of kids a break'. Let's go, Linda. Oh, we have been here before. Yeah. I'm renting it from Fogarty. The same as you did. Only I can't sing for my rent. It hasn't changed a bit, has it. No. Not a bit. And neither have you. You left the icebox door open. Help yourself. There some beer there ready. Unless you've got used to champagne. I haven't but I will ignore the crack. Bring me a glass too. In your honor. You know where they are. My, aren't we fancy. Who cleans up for you? Nobody in particular. Everybody pitches in. Everyone? Well, we don't get much housework done but we have a million laughs. I'll bet. Everything looks just the same. Houses don't change, Linda. Only people. You know. You sure do some funny things, David. Like leaving the icebox door open? No. Like making plans for those kids tonight. I wish I could get it out of my head you didn't frame it just for my benefit. That sounds just like you. Only I happen to have a sentimental side. Turn it over and what have you got? A hothead. I accept your apology. Well, that puts all the pieces back together. No. There is still something missing. What? I don't know. It's us. Have we really changed, David? Do people change that much? Help yourself. Thanks. I can use it. You still got that necklace? Sure. You want to have another look at it? No. But I want you to look at it again and look real hard. If there's not more white meat than ten thousand on that I'll eat it. You have already eaten it, Mr Rollins. And I would advise you to go on a strenuous diet. Your luck has run out. But it might change if I could have another crack at it. Does he have to keep walloping that thing? Call it a night, Happy. Look. We both know that necklace is worth more than ten grand. I admitted that when I loaned you the money on it. Personally, my taste doesn't run to jewelry. I'd rather have my dough back. I've been waiting for your generous streak to show, Clayton. You've got to advance me a little more. Here is the take for tonight. Look, Rollins. I've got your necklace and for ten thousand dollars you can have it back. I am not going to give you any more and you are not going to redeem it for less. No shortcuts. I'm not so sure about that. We're buttoned up in here for the night, Fogarty. So close the doors when you go out. I have to be getting back, David. Yeah. I left some lipstick on the glass. What am I supposed to do about it? Put it up on the mantle? Or drink out of it some dark night and smash it against the fireplace? Whatever you do, it will be sudden and violent. Please don't spoil it. It has been so nice. And brief. Here we go again. You finally brought it round to reality. You can't sit still long enough to give us a chance to see daylight, can you? I'm fed up with sitting still. And that daylight you're talking about goes on my bill along with the nights. It's pretty tough to forget them. Do you want to forget? Tonight? - I didn't say that. What is it you're trying to say? Just this. That when Rollins finally gets round to hocking you .. You're going to look awful funny hanging upside down in a pawnbroker's window. Just where do you draw the line on second-hand goods? I don't. Well I do. Call me a cab. It will be a pleasure. Car 3. "Go ahead, Car 3." I am over at my house. Will you send a cab over there to pick up a passenger. "You want us to drop food and plasma too? You've been gone long enough." Just do what I tell you. I am on my way in. Thank you. Car 5. Come in, Car 5. Car 9. Stand by. "Car 5 in." "Car 9. Standing by." Car 5. When you get down there tell them the medical examiner is on his way. "I am on mine." Car 9. Go over to Doc's place and pick up the coroner. Take him to The Last Chance. "Okey-doke." What about The Last Chance? - Somebody killed the owner. Clayton? When did you get the call? - Just now. You must have walked in. Are you going off duty, Dave? Not now. Hiya, Dave. What do we know for sure and what's missing? This is what killed him. That's for sure. It's also used to peel lemons. Any seeds on it? No seeds. No prints. The janitor found the body at 4:10 when he was cleaning up. You didn't touch it, did you? - No, Siree. I just took one look and yelled. And Mr Fogarty came running in and threw water in my face. Hi, Mike. I want you to take Mike's statement. - Already got it, Dave. Did he tell you he opened the safe after he saw the body? No, he didn't. - Well, I know. Because he left his hat on the floor by the safe. What were you looking for, Mike? The necklace Rollins gave Clayton tonight. It wasn't there. There wasn't any necklace on the body, Dave. Naturally. The guy who killed him took the necklace. Look. I know I have every reason to wish Clayton dead. But you are backing the wrong number, Dave. Alright, Mike. Pick another number. Linda's husband. Rollins. I walked in on a beef they were having about more money on the necklace. Why don't you ask Happy? No. I was home sleeping, Dave. Minding my own business when this horrible tragedy occurred. That is my story and I am going to stick to it. What you want to know? What was the beef between Clayton and Rollins tonight? Rollins wanted him to up the ante on that necklace. I can't say that I blame him either. Do you think he was sore enough to kill Clayton? You don't have to be sore at a guy like Clayton to kill him, maybe. Somebody might do it as a public service. But to be mad at him into the bargain would make it that much easier. You see, they sent me out of the room. So I don't know how mad he did get. Get a signed statement from all these monkeys. Right. How did you make out, Doc? - Fellow has been dead about an hour. Mortal death. Sometime close to 4:00 I'd say. More or less. Get me a report on this as quick as you can. Sure. But there ain't much to add. It was a mighty clean thrust. He's dead. You can see it yourself. Dave, can I say something? Sure. Go ahead. Don't go hanging this on Linda's old man until you're sure. You finished? I just don't want you to undo all you've got done. That is a big order. Up kinda early, aren't you? Yeah. I'm taking the census. - Isn't that a little out of your line? We just lost one of our most prominent citizens. Want me to help you find him? - I've already found him. Murdered. Motive: robbery. If you're here to put the bite on me for flowers you ought to tell me who it is. Clayton. That fellow at The Last Chance? What's missing? Two things. The guy who killed him and a diamond necklace. This could cost me my job. - Why? I've orders from my company not to let Rollins or the necklace out of my sight. Where was Rollins early this morning? Well, he finally gave up waiting for his wife around about four. How do you know this? I saw him in the alley by The Last Chance. He headed for The Fabulous. What keyhole were you peeping through? I was in the coffee shop across the street. Waiting for you and Mrs Rollins to show up. I wanted to see the fireworks. - You'll see the fireworks alright. As soon as your company finds out you missed the boat on that necklace. Well, this is a most unpleasant surprise, Lieutenant. What did you do, come to say goodbye to my wife? I've already told your wife goodbye. So I thought I'd do something with a little joy in it for a change. Would you mind smoothing that out a little? I'll try but it will still be rough for you. Where's the necklace? That's my business. - Not anymore. It was Clayton's business for a time but he's dead and the necklace is missing. I don't see what that has to do with me. You will understand it when we get to the Sheriff's Office. But just to give you a clue. The charge is 'murder'. Murder? That is preposterous. Preposterous and dirty. How dirty can you get? Let's go, Rollins. Alright, Joe. But it won't do you any good. Don't leave town, Linda. Your husband may need a loyal and trusting wife. On the coroner's evidence. The time of murder has been established at approximately 4 o'clock this morning. Can you account for your whereabouts during that period, Mr Rollins? Very easily. I was in my room at The Fabulous. With whom? I am certain my wife would like to say she was with me. Linda? Mrs Rollins. I am not going to ask you to testify formally in this case. But if there is anything at all that you can tell me. Under the circumstances .. I'm afraid Mr Rollins there's sufficient evidence to warrant your arraignment. Captain Harris. The prisoner is remanded to your custody pending my filing more information. If you want to apply for bail have your attorney talk to me. Mr Rollins, there are days when a man finds it very hard to do his duty. Captain Harris. - Yes, ma'am? I need a word in private with my husband. Well, that will be a change. - Please, Lloyd. I mean it. Alright. You can use my office. In here. I'll wait outside. - Naturally. I'm sorry if I've let you down, Lloyd. Think nothing of it. You'll come into your own later making last minute pleas to the governor. Don't talk like that. I don't believe you did it. Then why didn't you say so when there was someone around to listen? Because there wasn't anything for me to say. You haven't been honest with me, Lloyd. You've never explained the telegram or Monty killing himself. Or why you were so anxious to stop over in Las Vegas. I don't know much trouble you're in if you don't choose to tell me about it. Linda, there is a cell waiting out there for me. Do you need a better description than that? You don't have to stay in it. I can do something about that. Like what, for instance? I have managed to save some money. Enough to get an attorney and .. Raise bail. Why didn't you tell me this before? You might have prevented this disaster. There have been several disasters, Lloyd. Which one are you referring to? The one that kept you out with that cop last night. I'm ready, Sheriff. Mrs Rollins. May I give you a lift? The bus for The Fabulous is waiting. I feel like it ran over me. The Fabulous please. - Yes, sir. Make it The Last Chance. What's the idea? I thought this bus went straight through. What have you against The Last Chance, Linda? I'd rather get out. Please stop the cab. Suppose I tell him to go back to the Sheriff's office? I like you, Linda. But you don't fool me. Well, I don't like you, Mr Hubler. So let's not get any ideas. Alright. You shouldn't have left by the back door of The Last Chance at four this morning. Let me put it straight. What are you trying to hide? Before we go inside, tell me why you used the alley entrance this morning. I got in the habit when I worked here. If you had something to say, why didn't you say it this morning at the inquest? Two reasons. - What are they? In order of their importance, I'd say first it was the necklace. And then? The second is one of those things you never can put on an expense account. Nobody understands it. - Including me. I don't want to get my face slapped or I would tell you. Don't bother. When you came in this morning, show me what you did. I walked over there to the casino to look for my husband. Hold it. You stand right here until I tell you. When I say 'go' you walk right across the room. The same as when you came in this morning. What is this, a sobriety test? - Something like that. Come on in, Linda. You're welcome. We are playing game, Happy. Kings-X. I'm going to walk right across the room. It does my heart good to see you romping and skylarking around amidst the gloom. Inquest? Okay, Linda. Start walking. You flunked. I don't get it. - You went around the chair. What did you expect me to do, jump over it? You must have jumped over Clayton's body this morning. Because it was lying right here where the chair is. Either that, or you tripped over it and fell flat on your face. And you might have got up with the necklace in your hand. No? What do you think that is? It's a spot I guess. You couldn't have missed, Linda. Coming or going. Do you understand this game, Happy? No. Nobody seems to be enjoying it. I like the one where they pin tails on donkeys. A game like this can be a lot of fun. If you play fair. Would you take me to the hotel? Whatever you want. That isn't what you want, is it Mr Hubler? I can wait for what I want, Linda. Captain Harris, where would I find Lieutenant Andrews? If he took my advice he's fishing. In the Belgian Congo. Mattie. Mattie, come here. You want to see me, Lieutenant? - Yep. You were sent over to my house last night to pick up Miss Rollins. Where did you take her? - To The Fabulous. Is that all you wanted to know, Lieutenant? Yeah. That does it. Of course, on the way to The Fabulous I took her to The Last Chance. You always blab about everything else. Why didn't you tell me this before? You didn't ask me. - I'm asking you now. Tell me. If you're looking for the necklace I just flushed it down the drain. Incidentally, do they hang women in Nevada? They used to. By their pretty necks. You've certainly made a mess out of this place. What are you doing with this? - I peel lemons with it. Got to be careful. You may cut a finger. I'm going to cut something in a minute. What's all this about? You didn't say much at the hearing this morning. What did I leave out besides my personal opinion of you? You made a sucker of me once Linda and you are not going to do it again. What were you doing at The Last Chance early this morning? And just how deep are you in this with Rollins? I know what you want. You want to put me in jail too. And then you can lock yourself in with me and my husband. The three of us in a nice damp cell living happily ever after. That would cramp your style. You won't have room to double-cross us. Now, get out of here. Why don't you do your practising at home? I've got tone deaf neighbors. Here, I don't disturb anybody. After last night things are kinda slack, or hadn't you noticed? People are squeamish. They may just pick up when they find out we're running a bar again. Instead of a slaughterhouse. I wish I could make your piano talk and do my work for me. It works pretty well for me. And as for talking, it does that too. It's talking right now to you, boy. Why don't you take a look over there on the floor by that chair. That's a real musical chair, Dave. Take a look. It's got a sour note on it. How come we overlooked this? - I don't know. The point is, when Linda waltzed in here this morning in the wee hours .. She no see a body. And it was lying right there. Who said it was lying there? The insurance guy, Hubler. He showed the spot to Linda. Look, Happy. You know where the body was found. Don't try to involve me, David. I was at home sleeping like I said. He was behind the bar. But he wasn't stabbed there. He must have been stabbed here. Then dragged himself behind the bar. Trying to get to .. The telephone. The Fabulous Hotel. We got fooled, Happy. Nobody knows where the murder really happened except the guy who killed him. Mrs Rollins room please. Doggone me. It's got to be that Hubler fellow then. It sure does. Hello, Linda? Now don't hang up. - The chances I take in this racket. Look, I'm trying to apologise. Don't bother. I am busy and there's someone at the door. "Linda, wait." "Look. I know who killed Clayton." Do tell. Who? I'm on my way over there now. If you happen to bump into Hubler, keep him entertained. I heard you. Hold on. May I come in? - Of course. I was just going out. - I think I know where your necklace is. Somebody shipped it down to Los Angeles. I'm driving down to check on it now. Are you going alone? You don't have to ask twice. Come on. I'll put a few things together. It will only take a minute. Go ahead. Hello. Hello? Linda. Offhand, I'd say that is your friend, the cop. And you won't have to pack. You will do fine just the way you are. This is pretty silly. Dave knows about you. The word gets around, doesn't it. Get in. You're driving. Mrs Rollins room please. - Who killed Clayton? Cock Robin. Did you see Mrs Rollins go out? No. But I did. Where is she? - She stepped on you. They took a ride. Who did? Who was she with? - It wasn't her husband. Was it the insurance man, Hubler? - Yes. Did he check out? - Yes. He forgot to sign on the car he rented. - Let me see that. Mr Hubler said something about going to Los Angeles. Why didn't you tell me this before? - Mrs Rollins was driving. Car 3 calling headquarters. "Go ahead, Car 3." - Give me a clear channel. Emergency. All units stand by. Come in 3. "I've identified Thomas Hubler as killer of Clayton." "This man just left the Club Fabulous." Driving a 1950 Plymouth sedan. Green in color. Nevada license 28072. "Suspect may be heading for Los Angeles." "Attention Sheriff Harris." "Is the Sheriff at headquarters?" - This is Sheriff Harris. Whatever you have there, come in and make a written report. Suspect is accompanied by Mrs Lloyd Rollins. A possible kidnap victim. Car 3 off. Notify the Highway Patrol. We'll set up roadblocks. Get me the Highway Patrol. Sergeant Peter, this is Mitch. We need roadblocks on a homicide. North east. Foden. Junction Highway 91 at B5. "Junction Highway 91 at B5." Highway 95. At Lee Canyon. "Highway 95 at Lee Canyon." - South. The junction of 91. And D3. - South. "Junction of 91." - South east 3. Highway 95. At Dry Lake. Highway 95 at Dry Lake. 93. At the dam. - East 93 at the dam. Turn around. Hey! What are you doing with my car? Start it up. Go on. Start it. What's the idea? Get out of there. Get away and keep your mouth shut. - You can't do a thing like this. This is my car, mister. Be on the lookout for a 1941 Ford station wagon. Fenders blue in color. California license 5-Radio-7911. Being driven by Thomas Hubler. Suspect shot and killed Allen Whitwer. Owner of above-described vehicle. Proceed with caution. This man is armed and dangerous. He may have his kidnap victim, Mrs Lloyd Rollins. Notify the Arizona authorities to lookout for Hubler. Okay, chief. - Why Arizona? Well, I figure with 3 murders behind him he took a boat ride to the other side. Wouldn't you? - No. And it's not 3 murders. It's 2. What makes you so positive Hubler killed Mrs Rollins? Dave. All men were created equal. Except you. I still say she is alive with Hubler. And I have a pretty good hunch where they are. I say she's at the bottom of the lake in the seat of that car without Hubler. Is that the last word on the subject? I'm entitled to the last word. Look. I'm going to let you play your hunch. But if you're wrong. And you are. I expect you to buy me a steak dinner. A La Carte. Fine. - With Pies. A deal. Now, I am going to that lake to drag it from top to bottom. Give me the airport. Toby Redman. This hunch had better be good. Suppose you were looking for a place to hole up. And all the roads were blocked and you're driving a hot car. Where would you head to? With a dish like that I'd probably park first. What's the matter? What you mad about? Do you see what I see? Dust. And one tumbleweed going about seventy miles an hour. Go down and check the license plate. - Okay. What do we do now? Turn him around. There he is. Pick a dead-end street and we'll corner him. Andrews. Throw the gun across the floor. Is the girl alright? We're over here, Dave. Behind the trailer. I got the gun pressed against her head. Do you want me to pull the trigger? Throw the gun out. I mean it, Andrews. I said the gun, Andrews. The next one is for the lady. Are you hurt bad? I can't fly us out of here if that's what you mean. Here, let me. Dave. Been waiting for you. Are you alright? As good as new. I was just at the morgue looking at that Hubler fellow. Even dead, you can tell he is no good. I don't think murder was his business. Are you telling me a man picks up that sort of thing as a hobby? No. What I figure is .. He saw a chance to grab the necklace and double-cross his company. It looked like a cinch until Clayton nailed him in the act. He didn't plan to kill anybody. I've had a lot of experience with criminals, Dave. When a man decides to make a mistake he keeps right on going. Unless he changes quick enough. Like you for instance. You came pretty close to railroading an innocent man. What am I supposed to do, turn in my badge? Don't try carrying a torch at the same time. It's too big a load, Dave. Cops aren't licensed for it. But any time you feel it coming on. Leave your badge on my desk. Oh. What's the name of the lawyer fellow that handles the Clayton estate? Schiller. I must remember to give him this check tomorrow. I got the money from that blasted necklace for him. How? - From Rollins. That poor misjudged devil, after all the misery we've put him through. Do you mean Rollins gave you this? The minute I turned him loose. And why not? It saves all that rigmarole of impounding jewels. Sheriff. How long has it been since you've arrested anyone for stealing? Dave. As Sheriff I've been following my human instincts for eighteen years. And I haven't been hurt. Yet. Well, all I have to say is, if you want to hold your record .. When you open that drawer in the morning .. jump. Because that check is going to bounce right up in your face. Too bad the chief went home. - Why? I'd like to see his face when he reads this. Yours too. - You read it. I'm going off duty. 'We hold felony warrants Massachusetts Superior Court number 8351D ..' 'Charged with three counts of embezzlement and two of grand fraud'. 'Lloyd Rollins'. 'News despatch. We released this man today. Suspicion, murder'. 'Re-arrest. Hold and notify this department'. 'Telegraphic warrant sent. We will extradite him'. 'James Fitzpatrick. Acting Chief. Boston Police department'. Thanks. I'll handle this myself. - I don't blame you. Can I help? Yes. Give the chief time to get home. Then phone and ask him to come down here in a hurry. Tell him there's a few things on his desk that need his immediate attention. If he asks for you, where will you be? - Say I took my torch out for a walk. Hello Dave. Business or pleasure? - Both. What will you have tonight, Lieutenant? - The same. We're finally getting rid of Rollins. He's upstairs packing. I don't mean to cut you short. Frankly, I don't care. I thought you would be interested. - Definitely not. There you are, Lieutenant. - Thanks. Why don't you get into some line that agrees with you? Does it show that much? - You look like all your rabbits died. Alright. Here is to crime. Don't tell me it doesn't pay. Aren't you taking a lot for granted? - Tonight I take nothing for granted. I am laying 12-7 that you and Rollins won't reach the state line. Well, you've won half your bet already. How come? I told Happy tonight that I'd take my old job back at The Last Chance. I go to work in six weeks. Working might not agree with you. I have to eat. Dave, I've come to apologise. I was wrong. It's alright, Sheriff. - No it ain't. That Rollins is no good and neither is his check. You remember Mrs Rollins, don't you? - Oh. Excuse me, ma'am. There's no need to hold you. You are wrong again. I can think of a lot of reasons to hold her. Only this isn't the time or place. Hey, wait a minute. Dave. I don't intend losing the best man I've got. Take your badge back. What's the matter? Aren't you man enough to do it yourself? Would you mind taking a little ride down to the Sheriff's office, Rollins? Will I be coming back? - No, sir. This is as far west as you are going. Your next stop is Boston. I thought I could square those matters with a winning streak. It shows you how wrong a man can be, doesn't it Sheriff. Oh. It just occurred to me. Maybe you want to say goodbye to your wife? It occurred to me too. I already did it. Shall we go? Hello, Lieutenant. Hello, Bill. How are you? At first I didn't recognise you. Say you look like an old veteran. - I am. I am an old married man too. - This is our anniversary. Anniversary? - Yeah. We've been married a week today. What you said to my father. It changed his mind. Bridesmaids. Everything. Good. I wish I could have been there. Since you weren't. Well. We thought maybe .. Maybe you would like to kiss the bride? How does it feel to be running the place again, Mike? Fine. Now that you are here too. Hey. Remember me? I asked him to kiss her. Remember us? Hi. A couple of old married folks. I guess it would be only fair for you to kiss Bill. If I kissed Bill there wouldn't be anything fair about it. Congratulations. Come on, Linda. You know, if you congratulate everybody that gets marries in Vegas .. I'll never make a nickel. "You touch my fingertips." "And my heart is aglow." "What's on your mind, baby?" "You meant to kiss my lips." "And I can't let you go." "Maybe I should resist." "I am a fool I know." "Resist me, baby." "But at a time like this." "My resistance is low." "Your eyes have magic." "They seem to say." "Come closer, come closer. My darling, come closer." "And somehow you can't break away." "Can't you see that I .." "Want to be adored more than you'll ever know." "I know, baby. I know." "And I am going overboard." "With a capital 'O'." "So please don't be persistent." "Please keep your distance." "You know my resistance is low." "Your eyes have magic." "They seem to say." "Don't be persistent." "Please keep your distance." "You know your resistance is low." "Low, low, low, low, low, low." ..t-g..
