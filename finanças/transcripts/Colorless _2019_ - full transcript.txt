The person you have called is unavailable. Please leave a 10-second message... Hey, Oyamada. What's up? I'm seeing Mr.Kasamura but can't reach him. Huh? He went home for a bit. What? He got you. What time will he be back? I don't know. - Sorry, gotta go. - Oh. What's your name again? Oyamada. Oh, Oyamada. Right. How long have you been freelance? 2 years. Until then? 3 years at a studio. Ever work under someone after that? Not really. What are you trying to pitch with this portfolio? Huh? I asked you a question. Beauty-related photos, snapshots, even a baffling shot of a kid. Does this mean you're versatile or that you specialize in one? In other words, I don't get what you want to shoot. Oh. Did you get what I said? I sense no passion from you. A kind of drive, know what I mean? Have you ever seriously been in love with someone? It's obvious from your photos. You millennials are so... Maybe if something comes up. Thank you for your time. There is something, actually. Oh, really? Yeah. An acquaintance... Uh, not exactly, but this reader model needs help. June 2019 - July 2019 Oh, hello? I'm already here. Yes. I'm wearing a black t-shirt. Yes. Yes. Ms.Yuka Tanaka? Yes. Thank you for today. Great, huh? Romero. You know his stuff? He came up with the idea that it's scary when people walk slow. But the zombies at the start of the film run. That's true. What's in there? Clothes. I couldn't decide what to wear. I'll carry that. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Thanks. Um, Ms.Tanaka. Oh, call me Yuka. Tanaka is so ordinary. - OK then, Yuka. - Yes. You're cuter when you look more natural. Do I look fake? I'm not sure, but maybe a bit, yeah. What should I do? Be lazy. Think, “I'm hungry,” or something. There you go. You look hungry. Easy to say, huh? Good. So Mr.Kasamura has been recommending me, and I'll be modeling for some magazine soon. That's amazing. But I'm told I should go into acting, so I'm also taking lessons. Wow. Guess you never know when opportunity knocks. I just shoot knick knacks day after day. Knick knacks are cute. I'm shooting satchels next. Sounds like fun. Satchels for kids? Yeah. Are you and Mr.Kasamura... You OK? I'm sorry. I don't like cigarette smoke. Sorry. Sorry about that. This place has good innards. Here you go. Truly good Korean barbeques have good innards. - It's good. - Right? Reply if you have to. No, it's OK. Sarugakucho? The kanji characters for it are “monkey,” “fun,” and “city.” Huh, sounds like a zoo. - I can walk home from here. - Oh. So it's in Daikanyama. Wow! Not at all. It's old and tiny and freezing in winter. I'm curious what a photographer's place looks like. Yuka. Do you have a boyfriend? No. Oh. Want to see today's photos at my place? I'll give you the data. OK, but you won't do anything, right? Of course not. “33 Sarugakucho, Shibuya” Come in. I'll make space where people can exist. Excuse me. Wow. - It's not tiny. - Huh? - It's not tiny. - Oh, yeah. Oh, this one's good. You're right. We took so many. - We did. So hot, wasn't it? - It was hot. - May I open this? - Sure. I'll do it. Party style. Why? The leftovers will go stale. Never thought of that. You can do it! Yay! This way is more fun, isn't it? Harder to open, though. Hey, this one's good. You'll make it big for sure. I'm not so sure. You made me look so great. I have some on film, too. I'll give you the data later. Oh, are you sleepy? I think I'll go now. No, please use the bed. Paying for a taxi is a waste. - May I borrow a change of clothes? - OK. You said you wouldn't do anything. So did she cry for real, or to show that she's not slutty? Do women cry for show? Depends on the person, I guess. Some women can shed tears like sweat. I don't think she's that type, though. Oh, so she's this type. - Found her already? - Yep. “Finished shooting!” I shot this one on the left. - You shot this? - Yes. I did. It's great. Better than your other stuff. - Really? - Yeah. What, you want to shoot fashion? Yes. I had no idea. So you have ambition. Well, it'd be great if I could shoot covers someday. Though now I'm shooting bags. Who knew? I mean, photographers who do covers are super motivated. Really? Really. Besides, school bags are fashion, too, you know. For kids. Zooey Deschanel had one, too. That was so long ago. Let me shoot something women use. Hey, Zooey was so cute. What the hell? “I want to change my profile pic.” “Saw your post online! I'd like to shoot your profile pic.” “Read” “Sorry, a shooting session took time. Please take my photo.” Yes! Ready? Yes. Thank you for offering to do this. Why so polite? What should I think about today? It's for your profile, so let's keep it neutral. Pure, like. I wonder if I have any colors to show in the first place. Let's get started. This one's good. Huh? My choice would be... this one. - This one? - Yeah. Why did you decide to become a photographer? There was no big reason. No, more like an interview. Growing up, there used to be a film camera at home. I used to play around with it, is why. Oh yeah. It's this one. So it was like you got into photography naturally. I used to take pictures of my family and friends, and they were all happy to see the developed pictures. My dad was a cheapskate and wouldn't buy me a PlayStation or GameCube, but he paid to develop my photos because they were well-received. So you're here today because your dad was a cheapskate. Oh man, I can't do this anymore. - Now it's your turn. - What? No. - Not me. - Oh, come on. I think I'll go now. Huh? No. Because you're an animal. See you. No, hold on. If you go now, you can't have the data. What? That. How uncool is that? “You can't have the data.” Not cool. Come on, console me, Mr.Kataoka. And? Were you able to have sex by taking the data hostage? No, she kept laughing and I got self-conscious. I gave her the data and she left. Oh man, uncool to the max! Oh, shut up. What is this? I was told it's something women use. This proves women also have sex drives, doesn't it? But she didn't feel like satisfying it with you. I can tell you're versatile, but it's hard to tell what it is you really want to do. Oh, but this is good. Which one? This shot of the girl. - Oh, studio versions, too. - Yes. The lighting could be better, but they're good. Especially this one like a snapshot. It's good. Thank you. My chicken ramen is better. I like regular ramen. You want to try some of mine, don't you? Want some? Nope. What? No? Good ramen, huh? I can't move anymore. But you're moving. - Let's go again. - Yeah. Hey. Listen, Yuka. I was complimented on your photos today. Your photos do have a special quality to them. I'm in this line of work because I want to take photos like that. Yeah. I... Yuka, I... I really like you. What? So... I'm glad. Do you want to go out with me? Yeah, if it's OK with you. I don't get what's the point of going out with someone. Stuff like being in love with someone and missing them... You forget all that. Special moments and things that were special. As if they never really even happened. So what's the point, then? Huh? What? Remember how you said you were colorless? Well, that goes for me, too. I really get what you mean. The way you opened the bag of chips. The way you cried at my place. The way you laughed at me. I'm drawn to it all. So... So I... I want to photograph you more. There's no point in shooting me. Of course there is! I think I could capture the real you. Then... let's give it a go. Is that OK? I look forward to it. So do I. Looks tasty. Is it good? It's good! Popsicle's so close. Nice! Thanks. Isn't it too close? This is fine. Which room? Fourth floor, second from the right. I'll walk you there. Let me see inside. It's messy, so no. I don't mind. I do. It's OK. Don't push it. I decide if it's OK or not. See you. Bye. You scared me. I want to be with you after all. That way... good. Oyamada. Join me for a smoke? Sorry, I quit. Oyamada. I never trust guys who quit smoking because of a woman. “52nd Annual Newcomer Photography Awards” “Entries accepted from April 10, 2019 to June 26, 2019” Hello? Oh, thank god you answered. It's Yamanaka of Public House. I saw your portfolio the other day. Oh, yes, hello. Listen, the photographer we hired got food poisoning. Are you available the day after tomorrow and able to meet with us now? Really? Thank you, I'll be there. You're a lifesaver. The meeting's at our office. The back door's locked at night. Yes. Uh, I'm sorry, could I call you back? Sorry. - Oh, OK. - Sorry. Yuka. What happened? Come in. I have to go to a meeting now. You can stay here until I come back. I want to be with you now. Please, please, please... It has to be now, otherwise it's meaningless. Yuka. Please... don't leave me alone. Do you love me? I love you. It's ready. Here. Good, huh? It's good. It's good. Hello? Hello? What are you doing? Watching a movie at home. What's up? Just wondering what you were up to. What movie? “The Bullet Train.” Oh, the one where “awkward” Ken Takakura makes a sophisticated bomb. What the heck? When can we meet again? Soon, I hope. Yeah. I'll call you again. Yeah. Second from the right. Second from the right. Second from the right, second from the right... Second from the right, second from the right. “Kitamura” What the...? What? You have a boyfriend. What do you mean? Don't play dumb! You “don't get going out,” huh? You have a boyfriend! I saw a man going into your apartment. - You misunderstand. - Misunderstand what? We've separated. I lived with him. But I couldn't move out right away. I don't believe that! We're just roommates now. I was going to tell you after I straightened things out. It's true. I love you now, Oyamada. I can't trust you unless you move out from his place today. Don't come back here. March 2018 - July 2019 No change, huh? We're on the same bus, probably. I'll buy you one. No, I'm fine. Cafe latte, right? Going or coming home? Going. On vacation? Moving to Tokyo. Thank you. These things are useful, but it'll be kind of sad when we stop using coins. Tangible things gradually fading out, you know? That is kind of sad. May I ask your name? Yuka Tanaka. And you? Ryohei Kitamura. Now try introducing yourselves just with “ah.” Face each other. Ready, go. OK, OK. Very good. When you really want to communicate something, language breaks down. Next, express deep frustration with “ah.” Ready, go. Now “ah” when you're feeling great. When you've made a mistake. Just, “ah”! “Demand notice: Unpaid tuition, 864.000 yen” When can you pay your tuition? I was told I'd get a scholarship. Is this even correct? Like I said, and we've sent you leaflets many times, you're not on a scholarship. You were only eligible to have your entrance fee waived. What? You also got signed to an agency, but you must pay tuition. You need lessons to pass auditions. Regular students would love to be in your shoes. The higher-ups say you have potential, you know. Could you extend the deadline? Installments are fine. With interest added, though. Hi, there. That's your outfit. Babydolls are an option and you get 1.000 yen more. OK? I don't understand. I'll put you down as OK. This isn't a sex business, so no hand jobs. If a customer insists, tell me. I'll blacklist him. Yes. Hey, does this happen a lot? I don't do it, but some girls do in secret, saying it's a hidden option. If you're caught, we go out of business, so be careful, OK? Yes. Oh, so you want to get into showbiz. I don't just want to. I'm already signed to an agency. Then I guess you won't be sticking around for long. Too bad, I like you. Thank you. Ah, go a bit deeper there. Right, there. Go deeper. Ah! There. I said a bit deeper. So how's that job coming along? Quit if you can't handle it. But since you introduced me, Hisako... Call me Hisa. I'm quitting after I earn a bit more. I need money, so I'll keep at it a bit longer. Hey, there was this client who kept telling me to “go deeper.” Oh, that fat guy? Yeah. That guy, huh? He used to request me when I was new. He loves new girls. He moans so loudly. Yeah, his “ah” is something else. I wonder if there's meaning in paying 800.000 yen to say “ah” for 3 hours. Then try saying “ah” to express that feeling. Ah. That's good! OK, then... This tastes good. Ah. Today is fun. Ah. We're friends, aren't we? Ah. Let's hang in there! Make it big together! Let's make it big! Hey, if you have a boyfriend, you should take a shower. You smell like body soap. What? - Well, I'm that way. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. I'm home. Welcome back. Tired, huh? The “final boss” at our client's company told us to go back to the drawing board. I'm so sick of them. Drop dead. And the go-between is so incompetent. What? I asked you not to smoke. That's why I'm over here. - Here goes, then. - Yes. Oh, no posing, please. Yes. Here goes. 3, 2, 1. Thank you. Thank you. Yuka. What's wrong? No luck at all. There, there. This is a commercial for beef bowls. We'll be personifying a beef bowl. Personifying the beef bowl itself, including the bowl, to be precise. “Beef Bowl Man,” get it? Oh. So we'd like to ask you to have a conversation with that beef bowl. That's understandable. Try to imagine your best friend. Can you think of someone? Look, I get that you work as a model or an actress or whatever, but you can't just call before your morning shift and not come. But you said my shifts would be flexible. It was too sudden. There are limits. Yuichi was able to fill in today so we managed, but... I have things I want to do. Huh? What the hell? Everyone has a thing or two they want to do. Who do you think you are? - I like it. - It suits you. - Try it on. - Yeah, may I? She talks big, so I did a search. She has few followers, and only a few photos online. “Audition done!” I hear she's been passing auditions. Is that so. I can always fill in for her. See you. Oh, Yuka. I think it's perfectly fine that you have better things to do. What are you talking about? Oh, thanks for filling in for me today. Bye. Listen, I really want to be a wardrobe stylist so I respect that you prioritize your dream. I think it's amazing. Hey, I'll finish up quickly, so want to go grab a bite? Sorry, I have to go to a meeting. See you. Since you can come here around noon, are you in showbiz? Well, my coworkers think I go home for a bit. Showbiz, huh? Go home to do what? Dunno, work, I guess. So are you in showbiz? I'm a magazine editor. Wow. Face up, please. Face up? I like this position the best. My knee? Is this OK? Any interest in magazines? Well, I'd love to be featured as a reader model. That I could help you with. So you're in a high position. Let's leave it at that, then. Reader models run the gamut, and start from 10.000 yen a day. Oh, really? But many TV stars and actresses start off as reader models these days. So it's not a bad idea. Could you recommend me somewhere? Well... Maybe if you offered me extra service. What kind of service? Grab it. What? Grab it. You won't tell anyone? Who would benefit from that? Good. Look into my eyes. Good. Ah, awesome. Awesome. “Who's the girl in the beef bowl ad? Her real name? Look, this girl's in a commercial. She was here until recently. Ai Yoshioka. That's not her real name. It was Hisako something. I'm pretty sure she worked at some shady massage parlor. What? It's true. She tried to get me to work there, too. Yuka, did she recruit you? No, she didn't ask me. I see. And the reason why she recruited girls was because she got paid for it. Whoa, that's really low. Next, you'll miss the last train. Ready, go. Ready, go. Next, zombies. Ready, go. Ready, go. And everyone began walking slowly as zombies. I wonder why? They don't really exist. You know “Night of the Living Dead,” right? No. What? But I have a poster right there. Come on, tell me. It's a horror masterpiece. George A. Romero came up with the idea that it's scary when people walk slow. You know so much, Ryohei. Are you leaving? Yeah, back to work. Are you coming home? I have to work overnight. Take me with you. No, that's not right at all. You're no zombie. You said we could be together today. - Did I? - Yeah. I don't think I did. The stove's still on. You don't touch me anymore. I'm already here. Yes. I'm wearing a black t-shirt. Yes. Do people work overnight so often? Well, I'd rush home if someone I loved were waiting for me. This is done. It's so jiggly. Oh, thanks. Looks tasty. It's good. Wow, Yuka, you know such a cool place at your age. This is great. I'll come again. Truly good Korean barbeques have good innards. I get it. You're lonely. Good, let me hear you. Show me your face. Do you like me, Mr.Kasamura? If you want to think that I like you, then I like you. I don't get what you mean. Stuff like being in love with someone and missing them... You forget all that. Special moments and things that were special. As if they never really even happened. So what's the point, then? You're so cute. At first I just sort of casually wanted to go to a glamorous world. I really didn't want to end my life in my hometown. And when I auditioned, I passed. I didn't intend to become an actress, but enjoyed it after I started it. It's rewarding, too. The future? “Profile Photo Price List” But I'm paying tuition. Again, the fee to shoot profile photos isn't included. A photographer, studio, equipment... They all cost money. Can I pay later? You already pay in installments. Some ask friends to shoot it. “Saw your post online! I'd like to shoot your profile pic.” “Sorry, a shooting session took time. Please take my photo.” Sorry about the other day, Yuka. Oh, no offense taken. So what work will you be in? I'd love to see it. Did I say that? That's all you say. That you passed, you got offers, you met some producer... There are so many, I don't know which. I'll take these. Here goes. OK. Yuka, do you have a boyfriend? Yeah. I guess you would. What's he like? He has an art degree, and works at an interior design company. Do you know a company called Maugham? Sorry, I'm not familiar with that genre. He's only 27 but given responsibility for projects on his own. Look, here's a recent interview he did. “Careers in Design Interview” He sounds pretty awesome. He's making his dreams happen one at a time, and I'm so inspired by him. He also cares for me although he's busy. And his face is my type. Let me see the photo. Here. I look kind of flat. But the model is cute, so it looks good. I don't want you to upload this shot. Then I'll retake it. Sorry, I have to go. See you. Welcome home. What's this mess? I'll clean it up. Did you move out of your apartment? Why is your mail coming here? Well, I was always here anyway. Even so, you could have asked first. What the hell? I'm sorry. But you could at least say, “Hi, I'm home.” Don't smoke. I can do what I want in my home! Don't shout at me. Listen, I have a girlfriend now. What do you mean? I'm your girlfriend. OK then, I like someone else. I mean, were we ever going out? You don't pay rent, you're messy, you spoil food. You simply moved in without asking. I don't consider you my girlfriend. You lied about working overnight. It's no lie. Liar. You were with a woman. That crap is tiresome, too. Forget it. I'll stay with a friend until I save enough money. Yuka. What happened? I'm sorry I didn't call back. My phone stopped working. No, it's OK. Didn't know there was a heavy rain warning. Tomorrow is fine. Yes, I'll be there. Sorry. Don't come back here. I won't. After August 2019 Nice. Could you all come closer? Last three. OK. 10-minute break, then. - Thank you. - Thank you. You used to shoot sex toys before, but now you're so in-demand. Please don't. I'm not that popular at all. Did the award change things? No, since it wasn't the grand prize. Winning the grand prize might have. So you won some kind of award? Yeah, a gateway to success for newcomers. Wow, I want to see! - Want to see? OK! - Yeah! - No, don't bother. - Come here. - Which one? - Hold on a sec. - Oh, wow! - Right? - It's awesome! - Be nice to him. - Makes my heart beat faster. - Yeah, I know. Wow, good for your boyfriend. Yeah. He was awarded for the way the fragments of my expressions converged or something like that... Sounds deep. Yeah, it's deep. Oh, I have to take these off. They're cute. He gave them to me. On the day he won the award, saying he won because of me. How sweet of him. OK, all set. Yuka, are you ready? - You're up next. - Yes. All set. Thank you. Over here. Excuse me. Let's do it. “Fireworks” Where will you do those? Let's do them in a nearby park. They're not allowed in parks around here. Where are they allowed? I don't know. Then why do convenience stores sell them? I don't know. I'm pretty exhausted. You're so busy, Shu. Sorry. Everything's all set. Sorry, Oyamada. He's running late. What, is he messing with us because he's a popular YouTuber? He's hard to get a hold of and isn't professional. These things aren't his forte. But he's being paid, so that's no excuse. Mr.Captain Smith is here. Hello. Things like that are common, so try not to let it get to you. When I worked in a studio, I envied the photographer regardless of the content. Considering how far I've come since then, being responsible for a feature in a fashion magazine should feel more rewarding. But? I don't know... It's not very challenging, I guess. It's not like this was your goal, right? And the people around me really like your photos. Is this any good? Anybody could shoot this. Mr.Kasamura and I were discussing this, but we're going to launch a new fashion quarterly. Will you shoot the cover? We've already decided on the cover girl. It's this girl. We'll handle the styling and stuff. What? No? I'll do it. Seriously? I'll do it. I'll do it. Thank god you're reacting like that. You really scared me because you didn't react. - Sorry. I'll do it. - You will? Great. Are you ready for the mix-and-match feature? Not at all. I can't find any clothes for fall. I know, right? It's too hot to think about fall. I spend all my money on clothes. “I toil on and on, yet my livelihood never becomes easier.” Words of wisdom! Who said that? I forget. Soseki Natsume, probably. Maybe I'll try finding a sugar daddy. No way. You have to do stuff in return. Not necessarily. She trained a guy to pay her just by calling. - Incredible. - Yeah. That's great, Shu. That's been your goal. But it feels like you're leaving me behind. Don't worry about that. “Enter Passcode” Oh, by the way, who's the model? An actress named Ai Yoshioka. I hear she's gaining popularity. You're shooting her? Why? What's wrong? Nothing. Clearly it's not. What is it? I'm fine. No, you're not. It's really nothing. I want you to be my model for work someday, too. Shut up. Leave me alone. “Touch ID or Enter Passcode” “Ryohei” “Hey, you moved out?” “Yeah, a guy who likes me told me to.” “Then you have a place to live?” “Yeah.” “I think this was for the best.” “I'm still in love with you, Ryohei,” “and that won't change.” “Lend me an ear if this doesn't work.” “No way.” Working today? I knew you had it in you. I saw your winning photo. It was awesome. Thank you. Yamanaka told you about the cover shoot, huh? I know you don't have much freedom because the model and stylist are set, but we're aiming for something ephemeral like your award photo, so we're counting on you, all right? Yes. Hey? Hey, Yuka? Sorry, excuse me. Long time no see. How have you been? Fine, thank you. I saw that winning photo. It was great. I owe it to Mr.Oyamada. No... And that means you owe me. True. Right? You better “R” me, Oyamada. What does “R” mean? Respect, man. Respect. Still dating that boyfriend? The one who works all the time. Oh, we broke up. I see. Let's grab a bite again sometime. Yes. Thank you. - Excuse me. - Going now? OK. - Goodbye. - See you. There must be oodles of girls like her. How did you and Ms.Tanaka meet in the first place? You know those gray-zone men's massage parlors? She kept saying she needed a portfolio. What? You never know huh? A girl like that winning an award as a model. Yuka is awesome. Her service is incredible, she goes like this and... What's the name of the place? What was it? It's in Nishi-azabu, a place called “La Verite,” and she went by Kana there. Hello, Men's Massage La Verite. Um, is a girl named Kana there today? I'm in front of the apartment. Then the room is 409. Enjoy your session. Yes. Hello. Sorry, I have to go to work. Good evening, I'm Hisa. Hi, nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. Come in. “Actress Ai Yoshioka worked at a shady massage parlor!” “Thanks for the special service!” So you're working with Mr.Kasamura? Yeah. You hadn't told him we're dating. Huh? I haven't seen him for a long time. You didn't tell him either. True. How did you two meet in the first place? Why? I don't know, just curious. There's nothing to tell. I don't like Mr.Kasamura. The way he doesn't seem to trust anyone, and the way he insensibly looks down on people. What? Nothing. - “What?” - “Well, I want to see you.” - “Only without any strings attached.” - “Jerk.” “Can I come over?” “No way. What about your place?” Excuse me, you're Yuka, the magazine model, right? Yes. Oh wow! May I shake your hand? - What? My hand? - Yes, please! Thank you! Yuichi. Yes. This is Yuka, don't you think? “Angel Sweet / Therapist / Hisa” I guess it does look like her. It says she'll be in today. Doing a search on Yuka Tanaka only brings up weird rumors like this. She's been hopping from one parlor to the next. Why do you this? Because I'm bored? I don't have things I want to do unlike someone I know. Excuse me, I'm here for the business suit commercial. I'm Yuka Tanaka. Oh, the stand-in. Thank you. Please wait in the van. Hey, is she 165 cm? 155 cm. - Why isn't she the same height? - Sorry. - Put a box under her. - Yes. Do your job, man! This is so basic! Hurry up with the box. Is the starring actress ready to go? We should do the rest with her. Yes, sir. Hey, how's she coming along? She's done and on her way. - She's on her way. - Oh, she is? - Is she here? - Yes, she is. - Ms.Yoshioka is here. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Get rid of the box. - Oh, excuse me. The stand-in lady can go now. Thank you. So it is you, Yuka. Long time no see. Long time no see. I didn't expect to see you here. It's really been so long. This is amazing. So many people. I never went to college or worked in an office. You know what, though? This is all I have going for me. I'm determined to make it work. I know what you mean. Me, too. How can you say such things? What? You wrote things about me online, didn't you? What? That I used to work at a massage parlor. Why would I do that? It was probably a customer. I know you're using my name at another parlor, Yuka. Hisa. Why would I do that? Huh? I take this job seriously unlike you. Stop trying to drag me down. You were being paid to recruit new girls to work at that parlor. Huh? What are you talking about? Liar. You're the one who's lying. Ms.Tanaka, we need you again. They're calling you. - Stand there. - Thank you. Put that box under her again. Quick. Huh? Is she wet? Hey, someone wipe her off. - Bring a towel. - Yes. I'm sorry. Huh? Hey! “Done working for today!” Welcome. This is awesome. Feels kind of drafty. Someone said that a girl who resembled you worked here and I got curious. This isn't a sexual service, you know. Yuka, I could lend you money if you're in need. Or just keep it if you want. Why not stop doing this? You know something? You gross me out. Why did you come? Leave me alone! I can do whatever I want! But I was worried about you. Oh, just shut up! I don't want you to worry about me! Why not worry about yourself? What? You're so indecisive and always trying to please. You really gross me out. What did you expect by coming here? Did you think something would happen if you came? Hey, screw you. Who do you think you are? I know what you do. You give hand jobs for cash. Do it! Just do it! I won't! No! No! No! We have to come back? Let's stay overnight! Well, you can but the company won't pay. Man, how cheap is that? Geez! That can't be true. Come on! Shouldn't you take the call? It's OK. I'll call back later. Really? Give me a break. Can't we adjust our budget? “Yuka Tanaka” “Yuka Tanaka” Well, that's not... - It's the sea. We'll shoot the sunset. - Yes, of course. - So after that. - Excuse me. But we can make it back, so... Give me a break. Hello? What is it? Shu, what are you doing? In a meeting for the cover shoot. I have to see you. Come home now. Why? What's wrong? Just because! It has to be now! I can't leave now. Please, please, please! It has to be now, otherwise it's meaningless! I don't get it. It's not meaningless for me. Not now. Hello? Hey. Oyamada, this place is awesome! Can you tell why? Why is it so great? Only ugly women here. Ugly women are nice and loyal. Get it? He's so mean. He calls us ugly all the time. Even though he comes a lot. What do you think? Are we ugly? Well, I think you contribute to the diversity in society. Hey, you pig and rhino, stop talking to humans. That's so mean! Sorry I'm late. Having fun? - You're way too late! - Oh man, you're drunk. - So late! He's always late! - Oh god. - A beer. - OK. - Where were you? - Don't be mad. I cut short my date and hurried over. - Beast! Rascal! - What the hell? You're married with kids! A beer, a beer. You've probably never seriously been in love with someone. Of course not. - Here you go. - Oh, there it is! Cheers! Cheers! Aren't you joining the others? Everyone's so drunk. I'm thinking of going home. Then let's finish that. Did something happen? What? The person I love might be lying. And it's been bugging me. But... even if she were really lying, then why can't I forgive that? You're a nice guy, Mr.Oyamada. I'm not nice. You're home late. Sorry. Mr.Yamanaka insisted I come along to drink. I see. Yeah. Why'd you call? Something happen? Just suddenly wanted to see you. It's nothing. OK. Oh, remember that cover shoot I mentioned? We're doing it in Kyushu. - I see. - Yeah. Ai Yoshioka is there shooting a drama, so we accommodated her schedule. When will you be back? Location scouting tomorrow, shooting the next day, so the day after that? - I see. - Yeah. Shu... do you love me? Yeah. Do you love me? I love you. See you, then. OK, then. Could you turn around? Yes. OK, backside. OK, right. OK, front. OK, thank you. This commercial is going to be a bit unusual, in that you'll wear the products and we'll do a featurette on your life. Therefore, unlike a regular audition, we'd like to conduct an interview. OK. Oh, sorry, I'll take that. I see, so you came to Tokyo from Niigata to make your dream come true. In a nutshell, yes. What kind of person are you? What kind of person? I'm told I have a sunny disposition. No, what do I think? What kind of person? What kind of person? Ms.Yoshioka is here! - Hello. - Hello. Let's begin, then. Yes. What should I be thinking about today? Be lazy. Think, “I'm hungry,” or something. What the heck? - Good job. - I'm so tired. - Good job. - Good job. Let's stay overnight! You're still saying that? Good job. You know Yuka Tanaka, don't you? What? That photo you took of her. I thought it was great. I felt jealous, to be honest. When this cover shoot was set, I told the editors that I wanted to work with you, Mr.Oyamada. I hope my photos are like that one. You're home. You said you'd be away. What is going on? I saw your ex leaving. Say something! Don't shout at me. You promised never to see him again. I didn't. - You texted him. - I didn't. I can't believe this. This is my house! He really wasn't here. I tried to believe in you. Why do you do these things? He wasn't here! I changed after I met you. You're so genuine and a hard worker, and I love you more each day! It's true. It's true. Then what's this? What's this? Huh? What's this? I don't know! What's this? Tell me! You must have slept with another woman! Huh? You... You! Say the truth for a change! I didn't do it. I didn't do it! I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it... I didn't do it. I worked hard at my part-time job, I made an effort to build my career. You're the only one who really understands me! You're the only one! Why are you shooting me? Give it back! Stop it! Give me! It's mine! It's mine! I'm Yuka Tanaka, 22 years old. I was born in Niigata. Niigata sounds rural, but I lived in an urban area so it wasn't the boondocks. Do you have any likes and dislikes? I like sunny days. I don't like cigarettes. Why don't you like cigarettes? My father was a heavy smoker and argued with my mom a lot. That always bothered me. Could you tell us about your school days? Elementary school? I don't know if I was smart or not, but I did do my homework. My teacher would openly scold kids who forgot it. I didn't want to be one of them. There was a neighborhood girl who took dance lessons, and I started going, too. Our school had a performance day, like a school play, I guess, where we had an opportunity to dance in front of everyone. I was too embarrassed and didn't want to do it, but she volunteered to do it. During homeroom, I think, she raised her hand in front of the class. Summers in Niigata are really hot. That day was hot, too, and it felt like a sauna in the gym. The music started playing and she began dancing. In front of everyone. Thinking back now, I don't know if her dance was any good or not, but she looked radiant, and just so cool. So I felt sort of embarrassed, thinking, “Why didn't I raise my hand?” What kind of person are you? What kind of person? I'm told I have a sunny disposition. No, what do I think? What kind of person? I don't want to know. Is that everything? Yes. Then please sign here.
