(THUNDER RUMBLING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (BIRD SCREECHING) MAN: No! (UPBEAT MUSIC) GIRL: Oh, Jack, live a little. I can not help but be reminded of a Japanese proverb. Since I do not know how it is said in the Mexican culture, I'll put it into simple terms that you may understand. Where there are no dogs, the fox is king. But I am no fox, nor dog. Isn't that right, Armando? Yes, of course Mr. Nakamura. In Japan, we have certain customs in which we show our generosity by exchanging gifts. But you must understand, those who are selfish are greatly despised. You see, in a wealthy man's house, there should be no lean dogs. ARMANDO: You're absolutely right, Mr. Nakamura. You consider me a generous man, do you not, Armando? Of course, Mr. Nakamura. Then perhaps I let my dogs grow too fat? It is all an illusion, is it not? Generosity, selfishness. In Japan, we consider both one and the same. We generously give and we selfishly hope to get something back, but better. Ah, yes, yes, yes. Even sexual pleasure has its root in selfishness, and greed, especially greed. One must be clever not to be seen. Jack. I'll get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you will. Mr. Robertson will be leaving now. I'll show him out. (GROANS) It has come to my attention that an error has been made. My assets have grown considerably, but yet my bank accounts do not reflect my good fortunes. And every since I entrusted both you and Mr. Robertson in keeping my finances in order... Do you not see why this causes me concern? Look, I understand your concern With all due respect... It is said that even a man of wealth can even hire the devil. Although the devil may deceit the man, he can never, never fool the gods. Have I mistakenly hired a devil, Armando? No, sir. Look, I will send you the report, you could see it, you could have Mr. Robertson see it, and you'll see how I moved a few numbers around. It's... I'm afraid Mr. Robertson will be terminated immediately. Unless you wish the same, I will give you one final chance to undo your unfortunate error, or we both shall see who truly is the devil. Goodbye Armando. Fuck. Damn it, Armando, fuck. A warning would have been nice. You sound like my wife. Mm-mm. What? I can't return the favor? Just give me a minute, huh? And I'm sure we can work something else out. (CHUCKLES) Ah, shit. Nakamura is on edge about his finances, guess I'm staying late. Now I gotta fix a few things. Run away with me. What do you say? What do you say I ask your wife? I'm serious, Luna. Just you and me, anywhere you want. Think of it as a permanent vacation from all of this. Are you going somewhere? Never mind, you probably wouldn't do it anyway. I wish I could. Guess that's the difference between you and me. When I want something, I'm not afraid to get it. Maybe it's time you figure out what it is you want, and exactly what you're willing to do to get it. It's a dog eat dog world, baby. If you don't bite, you get bitten. How about now? That's nice. Ah! Ooh, you're so gonna get it. Ola, amore. ARMANDO: Oh, shit. It's not what it looks like. Oh, yeah? What is it? Eleni, I'm sorry. You will be. Eleni, come on... (SPEAKS IN GREEK) Baby, you're the only one... Shut up! Look babe, how about we just take a trip, huh? Anywhere you want, just name it. Anywhere. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (MUFFLED SPEAKING) Look what you made me do. (MUFFLED SPEAKING) Get him out of the car. Put him over here. LUNA: Get up. Untie him. Eleni, please... Don't make me tell you again. (GUN FIRES) Tape him up. I'm sorry. (MUFFLED SPEAKING) Screwing the secretary? You're a fucking cliche. I trusted you and you made a fool out of me. LUNA: God, Eleni, just let him talk. He's trying to say something. Okay. You have two seconds. Okay, you can have anything you want. I'll give you anything, a divorce, half of everything... How generous. Come on, babe. This is fucking crazy. Just let me go and we'll just forget about the whole thing, huh? You've been lying to me. And you've never lied to me? We all have our secrets, don't we? Okay, you've proved your point Now let me the fuck out of this chair. Times up. Eleni, don't fuckin' do this. Get me out. Be comfortable. What are you going to do with me? I've got a couple of things in mind. (MUFFLED SPEAKING) We have to figure out a way out of here. (MUFFLED SPEAKING) (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Fuck, cut me loose She's lost her mind Yes, I know, cut me loose. Just tell her what she wants. I don't know what she wants. Cut me loose so I can get us out of here. She obviously thinks you know what she wants Yes, I don't. Cut me loose, come on. Cut the fuckin' thing Cut the thing. ELENI: You're more stupid than you look Eleni, I'm sorry. Young and dumb. Just the way you like them, huh? She had nothing to do with this. She has everything to do with it. I'll do whatever you want. I swear. ELENI: Promise? Get up. Babe? I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me? I want the money, Armando. Okay, fine. You can have it. I said you could have half of everything I own. No. I want the real money. I don't know what you're talking about I think Luna might Wait, what? What money? Don't listen to her. . She's out of her god damn mind. I'm talking about the account you set up, malaka. The one in her name. Account? What account, Armando? What is she talking about? There is no account. For fuck's sake, Eleni, stop talking. Come on, he's your boss, you know what he does for a living. He's an accountant. Uh-huh, you never wondered about your clients, all that cash businesses. Doesn't that seem strange? ARMANDO: So what? It doesn't mean shit. What it means is that he's a special kind of accountant, one who takes dirty money and turns them into clean dollars. But why is there an account under my name? There is no account. For fuck's sake, Eleni, stop talking. Because he's been skimming pennies for years, only now they've grown into a thick wad, and you are the little ass he found to shoot it in. Is this true? Luna, she's out of her fuckin' mind. Call the bank and see, you know, the one in Panama. So it is true You're a real piece of work, you know that? I learned from the best. Who told you? And Who else knows? Let's just say, that when a relationship loses trust, there's no telling where it will go. ARMANDO: It's not your money, Eleni. Not yet. Yell, if you want some coffee,. You set me up. If anyone found out, they would think it was me that stole it. No, no, you got it all wrong. Nobody stole anything, I just... Just what? Moved some number around? Look, nobody's gonna find out. Eleni did. It's only temporary, Luna. Yeah, until when? Until someone like Mr. Torres finds out? Or even worse, Mr. Nakamura. Why would you do this to me? Because he's a selfish bastard. Always has been. Enough of this. Get me out of this chair you crazy bitch! Fuck! Shit, grab the gun, Luna. She won't do shit! Grab it! (GUN CLICKS) Try me. LUNA: Eleni, please stop this. What else do you want? You found the account. I want the password, and I'm not interested in sharing. No fucking way. There's some rope in the other room, go and get it. So, what's it going to be? You can make this quick and easy, or slow and painful. Very painful. It's entirely up to you. You don't have the balls. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Did you know certain methods of torture have been around since the beginning of time? Yeah, it's called marriage. There's really no end to the nasty things you can do to a person. I've been reading all about it. Armando, just tell her the stupid password. You can end this right now. It's very simple. You honestly think I'm just going to tell you? You have no fucking idea the position you've put us all in. What are you going to do, Eleni? Are you going to torture it out of me? You really got that in you? You prepared to find out? I read the most sensitive part of the body is actually the foot. Did you know that? You're making the biggest mistake of your very soon to be short life. They say that the foot has more nerve endings than anywhere else. Funny how that works. You know, all those feelings always getting stepped on. But you know all about that, don't you? I can't believe you'd do this to me. After all I've given you. What have you given me? I gave you life, you bitch. If it weren't for me you'd still be in that shitty little village herding goats. Well, lucky you. I only want one last thing Come on, Eleni. You give me the password, you get to walk out of here. Armando, just give her the password. God, is the money that important? You're not gonna do this, Eleni. I know you. You're right, she will. What are you talking about? Don't you want me to trust you? Eleni, I can't... Don't listen to her. Don't you dare. He doesn't care about you. He would toss you to the wolves if it meant saving his own ass. Now take it. Eleni, don't make me do this. I guess I have my answer I swear to god, if I get off this chair I'm gonna fuckin' rip your fuckin' head off Ah, Fuck! Oh, Shit! Ah, Fuck! Stop it! What's the fucking password? Ah, fuck. Fuck. We can do this as long as you like I got nothing but time. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come back here. Stop, Luna. Stop. You went too far. It's almost over. Fuck. (HEAVILY BREATHING) I thought we were only supposed to scare him? And we did that. Yeah, but now you're scaring me. Come on, I didn't mean any of it. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. We're almost there. We will get the password, I promise. He will talk, I know he will. And if he doesn't? He will. Just a little bit longer, trust me. Puta madre. Fuck. Fuck. Go, go. Un-fucking-believable. I didn't see that coming, I'll give you that. You don't understand. This was all her idea. Now, shut the fuck up, both of you. Armando, please, she's the one that made me do this. She said she was going to kill you and me. And I meant every word. Then do it. Go on. Pull the trigger and I'll give you what you want. Shoot her and I'll give you the password. Eleni, don't do it. Don't listen to him. It's a one time offer and it expires in three... Don't listen to him, Eleni. Two. Eleni, you need me. ARMANDO: One! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) ELENI: Rise and shine. ARMANDO: What the hell did you do to me? Are you ready to talk? Get me the fuck out of here! You're going straight to hell, Luna. I can't believe you did this shit to me You're wasting your time. This hole is really deep. It was an old well. So, you like to swap tacos? You should have told me that, could've really had some fun with it. Just give me the password. You really trust her, huh? It's a lot of money, Eleni. People do some crazy shit for that kind of dough. Fuck! That they do. Get me the fuck out of here. Mmm, would you like some? I'd like you to choke on it. What choice did you leave me? After all these years I stood by you. Whatever you asked, I did it. And I didn't say a word. Oh, you're a fucking saint, huh? ELENI: I did it for us. You did it for yourself I earned it, and this is how you repay me? What's the matter with you? A Greek woman is not spicy enough or I'm not so young for you anymore? Come on, babe. You know how much you mean to me. No, no, just give me what I want. I can't do that. Eleni. Oh no. Eleni, I'm doing this shit for our own good. ELENI: Did you know there's about 300 kinds of ants around here in the desert? Fuck! You are so gonna regret this. I read that most of them are harmless. That's not to say they don't bite, but there are a few who have a serious sting. Come on, Eleni. Get me the fuck out of here. I think you have about an hour. I guess by then we'll find out which kind of ants these are. Who helped you? There's no way you could've found this money on your own. I read that the coyotes have been aggressive lately. So, if the ants don't get you, I hope that you come to your senses before they do. Eleni. Eleni! Fuck, Eleni! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I don't care about the money anymore, Eleni. Maybe we should just forget this whole thing? That money is all I have. You have no idea what my life was like before. Maybe he's right? I'm gonna go to hell for this. I was thinking Costa Rica or Santorini. You can change your name if you want. Become anyone you'd like. Wouldn't that be interesting, be someone else? Maybe, I don't know if I really like who I am right now. You know, we all have someone to answer to, Eleni. Only to ourselves. My grandpa used to tell me this story. (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) In English. I don't understand Spanish. The story of the two wolves. He said that there was two wolves inside us. One was for the goodness and kindness, and the other for the evil and deceit. Always fighting, always at war. And which one wins? The one you feed. I'm going to take a shower. I hope you're not planning on leaving while I'm gone, huh? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (SHOWER RUNNING) (HOWLING) (GRUNTING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (HOWLING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) LUNA: Armando! (HOWLING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) What the hell are you doing? He's gone! How? I don't know. (OBJECT CLANKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) We gotta get out of here. We can't just leave. Fuck, the gun, Eleni. The gun! The gun, Eleni. Where's the gun? Did you take it? No Eleni, he's inside. Be quiet It came from the backyard. It did not, Eleni. He took the gun. We need to get out of here. There's no way he could have gotten in. So we're just going to sit here and wait? Come on. There's nowhere else to go. Locked, just like I thought. Meaning what? Where's the gun, Luna? I told you, I don't have it. He never got in and you know it. So you're blaming me? Why would I take the gun? Where is it? Why don't you tell me? How do I know you don't have it? I guess you don't. This is crazy, you know it was on the counter. Why are you doing this to me? I just want to get that password. (METAL OBJECTS CLANKING) Game on, bitches. I thought you said everything was planned? Nothing would go wrong. ELENI: We've come this far. We have to come up with, how do you say, plan B? LUNA: We need to figure a way out of here first, before it's too late. ELENI: And go where? We have no car keys I don't know, let's call the police ELENI: Yeah, right. And tell them what? That we kidnapped my husband and threatened to kill him? We can say he tried kidnapping us. No, we are not going anywhere, and we are not calling anyone. We have to bring him back here and take what we came for. I know we can do it. I just want to know if you are still with me? (KNOCKS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (LOUDLY KNOCKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Fuck! (GLASS BREAKS) He's not gonna take it easy on us, not after what we did to him. ELENI: That's why he's not gonna get the chance, right? That's your big plan? We're gonna bring him in and trip him with a rope? You know, a little bit of can-do attitude would really help us now. Don't you dare start feeling sorry for him. I'm not. Today in the office, it wasn't an act, was it? Jesus, Eleni. You tell me to do something and I do it. And now you're giving me shit for doing too much of a good job. What the fuck else do you want? He said that you agreed to leave with him. And you believe that? ELENI: I fell in love with him once, too. What do you have there? Pepper spray. I hope you're ready to use it. Listen Eleni, I'm only gonna tell you this one time. If I wanted to be with him, I'd be with him. But I'm here with you. And if we're gonna get through this, we need to trust each other. Okay, I'm sorry for all of it. And I'm sorry that I blamed you for taking the gun. It doesn't matter anymore. We just need to get the password, okay? (HOWLING) (GROWLING) What now? We wait. LUNA: Where is he? He's fucking with us. Armando, we are right here. Jesus, Eleni. You need to warn people before you do stupid shit like that. It's a flashlight. That means he could be anywhere. That's why we have to bring him back in here, right now! (RUSTLING) (METAL CLANKING) (GROWLING) Shit! Eleni, would you just wait a minute? He's out there. Exactly. Eleni, please, don't do this. Armando! Come on, baby. Let's talk about this. LUNA: Eleni, shut it. One of us has to go out there. Are you crazy? (LOUD BANGING) Eleni, please I'm begging you, shut the door. (PHONE RINGING) No, I swear. I wasn't gonna call anybody (GLASS BREAKS) Honey, Let's go. Son of a bitch, I knew it. Come on! Where is the gun? What did you do with it, Luna? Where is the fucking gun? I hid it so no one would get hurt. Now move! (METAL CLANKS) (GROANS) Eleni, My leg! (GROANS) My leg! Come on. Get it off! Watch out, watch out! My turn. Aw, babe, you gotta do better than that. How about another nose job? The one you had didn't do shit for you! Wait til I get my hands on you, you filthy whore. Even dental records won't identify you. Turn around. I have an idea, huh? After we fix that honker of yours, why don't we shave those chubby cheeks and maybe those fat fuckin' ears, huh? It's not so fun when you're on the receiving end of it, huh? Shit. Watch your step Luna. I'll be catching up to you real soon ELENI: Let me go! Oh, babe. We're just getting started here. Rise and shine. I saved you a seat. Front row and everything. Eleni, you have to tell me. Who else knows about the account? Eleni, who else knows about the account? You can make this quick and easy, or slow and painful. It's entirely up to you. Eleni's kind of in a bind, so maybe you ought to come back inside? Gotta say, it's a lot safer than being out here with the coyotes. FYI, they're persistent little fuckers. They like to hunt in pairs. They like to take little bites out of you with those sharp-ass teeth. Maybe for hours until you're all bled out. That's when they call the rest of them. Then the whole pack comes. They tear what's left of you apart. Something to think about, if not for yourself, for Eleni. It was her. I'd figured you might say that. It's the truth. We'll see. Now, I don't know if you came across this little tidbit in your online research. I swear this was all her idea The ancient Chinese had this really hardcore way of getting information out of their prisoners. She came to me and she said she found the account. The technique was called Five Pains. Yeah, it's not a catchy name, I know, but you gotta hand it to them, the chinks sure know how to fuck people up. Why did you put the money in her name? Why do you think I came to your office today? Don't you see that she's playing us both? Maybe. But I really need to know from you. Who else knows about this account? No one So the reason this technique is called Five Pains is because, number one, they chop the person's nose off. I swear it was all her idea, every bit of it. But yes, I went along with it. Number two and three, they'd cut off their hand and their foot. I'm so sorry I did this to you. Don't you see? She knew we'd turn on each other. And number four, they'd castrate the dumb shit. The problem was that after all that chopping, and cutting the person began spewing all kinds of shit, so you never really knew for sure if that prick was saying the truth. I'm begging you, you have to believe me. (SOBS) Which brings us to number five. Bet you can't guess what number five was. Please. It was the punishment for lying, Eleni! When they'd slice the fucker in half! I'll show you. (PHONE RINGING) Eleni can't come to the phone right now. LUNA: Let her go, Armando. I mean it. I hate to burst that bubble, but you're in no position to demand much of anything. But if you'd like to leave a message for Eleni, then I suggest you get your sweet little ass inside. LUNA: This sweet little ass is fine right where it's at. Maybe so, but I can't say the same about Eleni. So, Are you gonna join us? Go Luna, get... LUNA: What do you want, Armando? A drink would be really nice. Run Luna, now! Get... Shut... No, no, please, please. Armando, stop it. Just leave her alone. Eleni, are you gonna fucking tell me who else knows about this account? You got one last chance, Luna, to come inside. Eleni, I swear to god I will fuckin' smash your fingers. Fuck. How could you fuckin' do this to me, huh? Who knows, Eleni? I am fuckin' losing my patience, I swear to fucking god! (SCREAMS) Fuck, you see! (SCREAMS) (CAR ALARM GOING OFF) LUNA: Don't fucking move. Ooh, you look like shit. Throw it on the couch. Put your hands on your head. I only have one, thanks to you two. Do it. You sure you know how to use that? Oh, what about the money? You shoot me, you don't get squat. Yeah, but I'd sure get the satisfaction of it. Eleni tells me this whole shenanigan was your idea, I would tell you the same shit if you were breaking my fucking fingers. Funny thing is I'm starting to agree with her. Well then you're wasting your time, now get back. I underestimated you, Luna. I guess it's not the size of the dog in the fight. It's the size of the fight in the dog. Don't worry, I didn't tell him anything. Admit it, you're in it for yourself. Regardless of who found the account or how, you set up this dog fight so we'd tear each other apart No, no, no, no. You used me! Both of you did! I have proof, Luna Don't you dare. Explain this. Do you know there's a car parked outside, hidden under some bushes? LUNA: What does that have to do with me? It's a rental, your rental, with your signature right on it. I've never seen that in my life. (GUN CLICKS) Ah, fuck. (SCREAMS) Fuck. You took the bullets out. Put him on the chair. LUNA: You unloaded the gun. I knew you'd take it. I would never leave it loaded. Now! Give me the gun. Give me the gun! (GUN FIRES) (HEAVILY BREATHING) We need to call an ambulance. No. It's over, Luna. They'll come for me. They'll figure everything out. They're gonna come for all of us. Was it worth it, babe? How about you? I'm sorry. You're good, Luna. Too good. Give me something to write with. (COUGHS) That's not my signature. It doesn't matter. I worked too fucking hard for this money to let it go to waste. ELENI: No, baby, it won't. Remember what I told you? We said a lot of things, Mondo, a lot of things I wish we hadn't. When you asked about the money, I said I'd give you half. (COUGHS) Well, I'm a man of my word. Take it. Keep it, you fuckin' deserve it. You wanted the password? Now you could both fight over it. Every stinkin' penny. You fuck, you fuck, you fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, you fucking fuck, fuck! Eleni, take it easy. Give me your half then. I never said I would do that. How about now? We don't even know if that's the real password. Yes, that's the real deal. You can call the bank and check. Consider it my gift to you both, or one of you anyway. (COUGHING) (GUN FIRES) Just open the door, Luna. I'm too tired for this shit. You don't leave me much choice, Luna. Come on, give me that paper. You have about 10 seconds before I open the door for you. Times up. Don't you dare. Don't make me, I mean it. Just think this through a minute. I swear to god, Eleni, I don't care anymore. Okay, alright, give it to me and I'll let you go. You want me to believe that? You've been lying to me this whole time. And you haven't? The license, why is there a license under my name with your picture on it? Luna, listen to me. No. You rented the fucking car. Put the lighter down. The gasoline? You think I'm so stupid, but I know what you're doing, Eleni. We don't have time for this now. You thought you'd find yourself a little girl that would do whatever you wanted. ELENI: You always had a choice. So did you. Are you crazy? You called me! You were gonna light this house on fire with me and Armando in it. You were pulling all the strings, Eleni. So you could disappear and run away with the money as me. You're fucking sick. Yes, I am. (GUN CLICKS) No! You really are stupid! (LAUGHS) Eighteen million dollars. (LAUGHS) (PHONE BEEPS) Mr. Nakamura. It's Done. I'm afraid I have some bad news. They're both dead. And? And about the password, I wasn't able to get it, I'm sorry. So am I. (GUN FIRES) NAKAMURA: Luna. Luna! Luna! Nakamura? Armando. Go fuck yourself, you Chinese fuck! I'm Japanese. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Japanese, Chinese, I don't give a fuck! I will search every shadow until I find you. Yeah, you do that. I'll be basking in the sun, sitting in a pile of money. Your fucking money, you prick. (LAUGHS) I beat you! You will be praying for death Yeah, that Mexican kid, you thought would never amount to shit. Yeah, I fuckin' won. (LAUGHS) (GROANS) Fuck! Fuck! Armando Fuck. Oh, fuck. Armando. (COYOTES GROWLING) Oh fuck. Fuck, shit, no. No, no, no, no, no, no!
