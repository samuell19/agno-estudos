Hmph! God! The government will not be blackmailed. We must ration energy and endure these cuts until these radicals accept these... They're only asking what's due. This strike is for everyone at the bottom of the pile. Everyone who is sick of being treated to... Angels sent by God to guide me. Be my light and walk beside me. Be my guardian and protect me. On the paths of life direct me. Morning, darlin'. Good morning. Good mornin'. Good morning. You know I think we do it at night time, there's more power. Less of a shortage. What about the generator? Well, that can fill the gaps. East London World Radio... Keeping you good company. And I'm your devoted host, DJ Mike. If you keep calm and it's all... You've requested Pediatrics, I see. Why? Oh. Well, I... I'd like to think I have a feel for children. You need an iron will, not a feel for them. How did you find your studies? I loved it. It was a dream come true to be there. This all is. Our borough holds the poorest in the city. Why do you think you can cope? Well, I'm interested in the connections between poverty and health. The connection is people round here live like animals. And where are you from? Around here. Back to serve your community. How noble. I thought I'd be most useful here. Accommodation? I'm hoping for a place in halls. Can't you stay with family, if you're a local? I don't have any. I grew up in Our Lady of Grace. The children's home. Yes. Well, you couldn't have picked a worse day. We have to move nearly all the patients out because of the cut tonight. It's chaos out there. Ideals are fine, but what I require is discipline. No sitting on beds or eating on wards. No makeup. Hats must be upright. Skirts three inches below the knee. If you take it shorter, I will notice, believe me. I use a ruler. Stick to your rank, never question an order. Don't even speak to the doctors. They communicate above your level. Yes, Matron. Thank you for choosing me. I won't keep you if you don't fit. Don't mind old Starchy. They're a dying breed, matrons. They'll cut her post soon and she knows it. It's fine. Nurse: It is a bit of a maze, this place, but the floors are color-coded, thanks to Matron. Green on ground, brown, blue, yellow on top. I like to think she's got knickers to match. She's put you on Gyno ward, on blue. Can you manage that? Are you ready for the cut tonight, then? Longest one yet, isn't it? I don't wanna fuss, but is it gonna be much longer? What would happen to the health service? Won't be long now, I'm sure. What you doing? I thought you were on the Pill? I told you, it just makes them think you're loose. Can we stop talking about it? That's the new girl. Hey! Hello? What was it like, in Our Lady's? Terry, she's just sat down. I know nuns. I bet it was the pits, wasn't it? You poor lamb. I don't think about it much. Ignore her. You'll find speaking your mind is not popular around here, Val. Speaking of which, are you coming to the union meeting tomorrow? Wake up. They're never gonna listen to a bunch of girls. That's the point of a union, Terry. You're the one always moaning about working in the dark. What's it like here, then? When the power's out? A place people die in should never be allowed to get that dark. There you go, again, see? Moaning. I'm not moaning. I'm telling the truth. This toilet's for nurses. Come out, please. Oh, no, not that way. That's the way out. Yes, come on. You need looking after, don't you? Goodness. You'll catch your death. Excuse me, Doctor. You have a runaway. Saba. Now, how are we supposed to get you better if you keep running off? Go on. Back to your bed. Are you Doctor Franklin? Yes. I saw you give your paper. I agree with every word. Slums kill children. They're the disease. The truth isn't always popular. The thought of doing work like yours got me through my training. Matron. I not meant to talk to you. Matron, I was wondering if we might have this girl up here with us today. She's needed elsewhere, Doctor. Yes well, I rather think that I need her here. Very well, Doctor. Let's have a listen, Still not fully cleared. And no weight gain. What do you think? Oh, I couldn't say. I'm asking you to. How about that nasty brown cod liver? Are you swallowing it all down? You're not just pretending, are you? Well, she's got rickets as well, hasn't she? Yes, I think so. She's getting cod liver, isn't she, Matron? I'll check with Sister. She's certainly not well enough to go home. We'll send her to Central tonight, with me. Don't worry. I'll keep her away from you. Is she one of your case studies? Yes, yes, and the building that she was in. I've had several from there. You haven't had any visitors either, have you? Franklin? Ah, it's like I never left school. You might want to check her bed. Sir? Three congenital heart diseases. Um, Ebstein's anomaly. Come on, man, pathetic. Faster. I used to wet the bed sometimes. Even as a big girl. Do you speak any English, dear? Little. How old are you? 13? You're a little thing. You come with me tonight? To Central? I'm not working tonight. I'm a bit scared of her, too, but just be good and do as you're told and you'll be fine. Franklin, can we please get on with it? I have served this institution for many years. The authority I have here is hard-won, believe me. And you undermine it in public on your first day? I'm so sorry, Matron. I really didn't mean for all that to happen. Do you understand you are on trial? Or did you only come to flutter your eyelashes? Yes. No. Clean this ward. From top to bottom. And I need a girl for tonight. You will stay on. The dark shift? Oh, I can't. I'm not ready. Does the dark bother you? Well, it's just I... A nurse must give of herself entirely. Sacrifice. How much are you willing to give? Hello again. Are you staying on tonight? Yeah. Must be my lucky day. She got you back, then. Oh, dear. I feel rather responsible. It was my fault, really, but, us doctors tend to get away with it. Oh, well. In for a penny. You're a saint. Oh, I never caught your name. Valerie. I won't have Central lord it over us. Just tell me, am I on the schedule? Nurse: We're on the schedule, sir. Would any remaining staff please make their way to the main entrance. Final transport to Central is about to depart. The only ward left here tonight is Antenatal and Intensive Care. Generators will power them. You will be on Intensive Care. Stay on the ward unless essential. It'll be very dark. That's it from me. I'll be back with the power at 7:00 AM. Take good care tonight, stay safe, and stay near that candle. That's too early. Isn't that too early? Hello? Wow. Bloody hell. Hello, dear. You looking for us? Am I on the wrong level? You're on shite level. You want piss. You're on brown, dear. You want yellow. You made my heart stop. Stop reading that nonsense, then you wouldn't be so jumpy. They're not nonsense. This one's about a girl who has enough and brings the whole place down. Can you see why I like it? Nursing really isn't her calling. Try telling my ma that. Do you know how to get up there? I'll take you then, before this one ruins you. Innocent new girl, Terry. What about you, then? What brings you to nursing? I suppose, working with people who care. I thought it might be a bit like a big, kind of... family. Jesus. You'd have to be desperate to want this lot as family. What's wrong with the babies? Oh no, it's the mothers that are sick after the birth. They just need milk and cuddles. You worked here long? Ugh, years. I like it well enough, but prefer to have been a doctor sometimes, but eh, another life. Look, you seem like a sweet girl, Valerie, but there's always someone trying to control you in a place like this. You have to stop it first day, or it's the start of trouble, right? Thank you, Comfort. Did I say you could touch? Valerie. Barbara. I thought I saw you. God, don't. I feel like I'm back in school. It's Babs these days. You're not the trainee, are you? And it's Val now. Dirty brown, all scrubbed up. Well, well. Pressure, respiration, temperature. That's it. Over and over again. It's deadly boring, this ward. Patients can't even talk. Do you like talking to them, too? No. All they go on about is being ill. It's just more fun. Like if they say, "Any tea going, nurse?" And I say, "Greedy guts, you've just had it." Even if they've not. They can open, but they can't see a thing. They don't teach you half of it in college, believe you me. You look nice, Babs. You look just the same. What is that smell? It's like it's following me. Still making yourself an easy target. You're too much. No, really, it's like burning or something. All you lot from Our Lady's were easy. We were rotten to you, really, weren't we? It was the teachers' fault, mind. They were worse. Does your mother still run the pub? She says I'm lucky as a princess to have this job. She should come and clean up shit and sick all day. I tell you sometimes, I'm that desperate. Anyway, I'll be married soon. In a proper house, further out. Engaged, are you? I will be. Seen any doctors you like? I'm here for a career. Really? I heard the new girl was all over Franklin. That's not true. Well, he's taken. He's sweet on me. Anyway, with your reputation... Bloody generator. Well, what about the patients? Back up batteries for now, silly. Never want the generations down. No, come up, you lazy sod. Oh, wait... Babs, that's my light. I don't know where yours is. Cerebrovascular accident. History of aneurysm, seven years. Childbirths, nine live. Who did that? Imagine making up something like that. Everyone heard about it. The whole neighborhood. So it ended up "dirty brown." Dirt sticks, don't it? What's up with you? Did you pull me over? How could I? You weirdo. Alright? Name's Nev. Did you take a tumble? Yeah. It'll be alright, girl. Something there, though. Spick, is it? Tell me you're not. Your looks. I don't know. Ah, yeah. Our Lady's girl. Don't you know your folks, then? Well, you've come out of it alright. Dark getting to you, was it? Mind you, a night with the Angel of Death over there, that'll get to anyone. You can use my lamp, if you want. Oh, really? It's the brightest they've got. Always lit up, me. Yeah, no, and mine's not up to much. 'Course. I don't mind the dark. I love working nights. You can get up to all sorts. I can take her down a peg or two. Anytime. Just ask Nev. Enjoy that, did you? Are you okay? Never let them get anything on you in here. We're screwed. Made you tea. Why are you being nice to me? Thanks. That's what nurses do, isn't it? Look after people, whoever they are. Whoever they are. I didn't mean it like that. How do you have the nerve to act high and mighty? Why did you make that stuff up? It's a pity you couldn't keep your mouth shut, then. That poor man. Let's be friends, Babs. We're grown-ups now. Run downstairs and get some med charts. We've ran out. Matron said not to go off the ward. Unless vital. What would she say if I tell her you refused an order? Go on, then. Bit of dark won't hurt you. What you doing? My job. Locking the exits. Don't want any unsavory types getting in. How do we get out, then? Ask me. Going in this ward? I'll walk you. Go yourself, if you'd prefer. Hang on. This is my room. I need to get some fuel for the... Come in. I wanna show you something. My famous league table. Most of you girls are up. The docs love it. Don't know about you yet. Maybe a 7, if you smiled a bit more. I need to get on. Come in, then I'll walk you. Go on. Come in, be a laugh. No, thank you. What do you think I'm gonna do to you? Bye, then. I wouldn't bother, love! You're soiled goods anyway! Hello? Hello? Get off me, stop it, stop it! Get off me! Stop, stop, stop! Babs? Babs? Babs? Hello? Babs isn't here. Babs? Val. Val? Val, what's wrong? Jesus. It's the cleanest one, I'm afraid. Was it something to do with Babs? Is that why she's not here? Come on, now, say something. We have patients to think about as well, remember? I was... attacked. By who? Where? Something chased me to the basement. What, some thing? Some one. Did you see his face? It was too dark. Anything? Really, I didn't. It's your duty as a nurse to say something. When I looked, there was no one there. Are you just making this up? I'm sorry Val, but I've heard a few things. No, I'm not making it up. I know how it sounds, I do, but it's been following me all night. Maybe tonight was too much for you to handle for a first shift. Maybe you should go home and rest. Matron will never have me back if I leave. I'll be finished. Maybe you're right, maybe I did imagine it. Well, why were you in such a state, then? I'm not very good with the dark. So you agree, then? You imagined it. Nothing really happened to you. Nothing happened. What was that? Hello? Is somebody there? Comfort? Look what the cat dragged in. Thieving milk, no less. Yes, no fuss. Bed. Whatever that was, it was rude. Alright. Do you want to die, young madam? You are sick, and we have the medicine and food. If you want us to care for you, behave. Will you look at that? Snow White has a way with the animals. They are right. You mustn't keep running away like this. Is that why you got left behind? Look at this. Nice, isn't she? And if you open her up, there's another girl inside. And another. You like drawing, don't you? Can I have a look? Why do you keep running away, Saba? Are you scared of something? Val, what would Matron say? Don't get too attached. Checks, please. Not much longer with the patient, than we can... And I'll bet that's Stan and Neville, and that'll be why he hasn't answered. Those two are as thick as thieves. They're thick alright, I'll give you that much. Had too many biscuits. Nothing happened. Val? Comfort! Val? Val, it's okay. Val? Alright. Hey, hey, can you hear me? Val? Val, listen to me! What's happening? Are you epileptic? That is not what that was. Have you ever had a psychosis, or... No. I'm just normal. I'm gonna have to call for more help. Nothing's ever happened here before, and then you come and all hell breaks out. That wasn't there before. Terry, where are you going? I don't like it. What...? It's not... It's not right. Terry, you can't leave your post! They will sack you! Sorry Comfort, but screw the lot of you. The door's locked! I know a window. I'm away from here, right now. Terry, you can't leave me alone! Terry! Saba, I don't want you near her. I shouldn't go. I know how much you wanted this, but I'm telling you, you should. Comfort, something did happen to me. I just pretended it didn't. Look at the bruises on my neck, can't you see? There's nothing there. You're okay. I'll just say goodbye. No, you'll only make it worse. Do as you're told and leave. What have you done? Ahh! Let me go! I want to go home! Saba? Saba? Saba, run! - Saba! - Val? Saba! Val! Saba? Saba! Val? Yeah, but nothing like the chaos here, I tell you. Let's just say she's... You shouldn't be near me. Well, what's wrong with you? Go! Oh, wait. I'm sorry. What have you got there? Who is she? Dirty. Gail. What does she want? Bad thing will happen to me. How are you still awake? I gave you enough to knock out a grown man. Who's Gail? Go back to your bed. Who is Dirty Gail? What are you doing? I'm increasing your dose. No. Gail is the one that's doing all this. Why would I hurt myself so badly? Maybe you've latched onto her because she was from Our Lady's, like you. And if you're thinking she's haunting you, let me stop you right there. She didn't die. She ran away. She was destructive. She lashed out. She was a very angry child, very hard to like. She was just a rotten apple. Do you remember the dog? What, that filthy, purple thing? Yeah. Well, she... Yeah, we tried to take it off her, but she never ever put it down, why? Well, I found it, in the basement. I had it in my hands. I can show you. If I find it, then will you believe me? I can't see. She's been here the whole time. You did this. How could I be so stupid? I didn't touch her! It was Gail! Get back. Get away from us. Get away! Get in there! Don't make me, it's too dark. You are the danger here. Get in! No! Get in! Leave me alone! Leave us alone! What? What's happening? Valerie, move away from her. What's happening? Who is it? Is it her? Comfort... I tried to tell you. This is a hospital. Vulnerable patients, remember that. But you didn't listen. I'm listening now. Gail? I didn't do anything to you, did I? Gail? But I should have told someone. I know I should have told someone... Gail, if that's you, please... Please forgive me. I didn't do anything, did I? It was him. I'm gonna tell everyone what he did. I'm gonna tell everyone, Gail! Don't hurt me! It's okay, we can climb down. I'll look after you, okay? I'll... I'll get you to the other hospital. Saba. Val? You have to go. I don't want to hurt you. You're good. I'm not good. Deep down. She can see it. That's why she's using me. And if I come back... do what you have to. Angels sent by God to guide me. Angels sent by God to guide me. Angels sent by God to guide me. Angels sent by God to guide me. Angels sent by God to guide me... Saba. What have you done? Stop!! To guide and protect me. On the paths of life direct me. It's my body. You can't use me now. Listen. Stay quiet, she'll see me. No. See what you've done. Go back and shut your mouth. Stay quiet. You're a monster! Jesus, what the hell happened? Good morning, good morning. East London World Radio, DJ Mike, here to soothe your cares away. Quiet now. Try not to speak. You're lucky to be alive, but you might wish you weren't. She's in here. My, God, what a mess. She wouldn't leave me alone till I brought her, but I'm not sure we're allowed in recovery. Did she hurt you? Where did you go? Can you ask her? She says, "Gail didn't want to hurt me. She hid me till morning." She hid you? "She's the same as you and me." What... What did she say? She said, "Goodbye, nice to meet you." Well, no, she didn't. What was it? None of it was true, and I'm new here. I don't want trouble, okay? Where are you taking her? Care home, I think. Best place. Oh, Saba. Are you safe now? Gail? Two staff members died here last night, Valerie. What do you know about that? I want to speak to the police. We agreed this may be more my department. I run the psychiatric wing. What happened last night? In your mind. A patient here was raped and killed. What do you know about that? This is the "ghost" that you told Comfort about. Why would this entity hurt them? I think Barbara knew about it. Maybe Neville did it. And why did it choose you to work through? Are you special in some way? Not at all special. Like her. But maybe she saw something I couldn't. The thing is, Valerie, you've made things up before, haven't you? The rather sordid accusation against your headmaster, which you withdrew and admitted was a lie. Do you still feel a need for attention? Well, I've heard enough. Well, what about Gail? Can you check the basement? I think he burned the body. We're never had a patient here called Gail. Stop! I didn't make it up. The police and the nuns forced me to say I lied. And every time I'm in the dark... I know it was real. And Gail is real, and what happened here is real. I'll come visit you, Val. If they let me. Just... Check Saba gets away from here safely. I will. I'm taking her to the home myself. Doctor! Valerie, you shouldn't be out of bed. I want you to stay here. Excuse me, would you mind just making sure she doesn't go anywhere? Thank you. Come on. Let's get you back. Isn't it the basement you go to? Very well, then. Uh, no you don't. Do as you're told. Good morning, East London Royal Infirmary. Can I help you? Did Neville give you those? He'd do anything for a nod for a doctor. Take off your robe. You had me pinned from the start, didn't you? Little nobody who wouldn't complain. We're not here to talk. Are you listening to me? I don't have to listen to you. I have the power here. Gail was a child. Where's the power in that? Shut up. You're a coward. You will shut up and be quiet. I will not. Shut. Up. No! Shut up! And do as I say! No! You can't have Saba. I won't let it happen again. Gail. Come back now. Oh dear, Valerie. Looks like ghosts don't exist. Just us. Valerie. Oh, you girls, you all sing. Want the attention. You want to pull yourself up out of the depth. But you can't take. We are giving. You have to understand the system. You have to understand... Val? Val? Gail, please. Please. Together. I told you to stay. All this running away. No one is going to look for you now. You will listen to us. Yes? It's coming. There's someone coming. Who is it? We blame you. For letting this place be rotten. There's another way. She doesn't want to be laid to rest. So think of us when it's dark.
