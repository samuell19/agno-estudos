FILM POLSKI presents Featuring We've no way now of removing the faeces. How about a smack on the bottom? You're in the way. Wait a moment longer. He's moving. Screenplay Inspired by a legend and themes... ...from DER GOLEM by Gustav Meyrink. Reflexes... Unconditioned, normal... He's coming round. Plug his mouth. What with? Anything. That newspaper will do. Music The muck's come out... I'd say... ...an IQ below sixty. What about the matrix? Alive? Yes. He looks quite nice. Photography Take the paper out or he'll choke. Damn. It was my paper. Still unread... I'll examine them both tomorrow. Directed by THE GOLEM In '41 the threat to survival... ...which followed an atomic disaster... ...bred rumours that artificial men were being created. One source was.... ...the legend of a dummy... ...brought to life when a magic formula... ...was put in his mouth. That such experiments might be... ...part of the program for reconstruction of mankind.... ...is an obvious superstition. When did you last have your eyes treated? You're on Dr. Wassora's list of patients. I don't know any Dr. Wassora. Nonsense! You know he's dead. Sign this statement. I've never seen Dr. Wassora. Don't you realise where you are now? Very well...So, your name is Pernat? I want to help the enquiry, but how? There's one way of you doing that... What can I testify? You know more than I do. I don't know my neighbours. You know that too. You've lived in that building for 30 years. And now you sit here and... Well, are you real or aren't you? I work... A man died next door to you. A doctor, and so a man needed by other people. That makes all your pleas of ignorance... ...assumed an utterly different significance. - Need this? - No. How are you doing? I want to help. But I don't know what to say as I know less than you! We'll begin at the beginning. Your name? This was embedded in Dr. Wassora's throat. An awkward instrument... ...but nevertheless used to murder him. What's your view as a neighbour? My technique is etching with acid, or engraving. Like hell it is! A floor below you... ...there dies Dr. Wassora, our best cataract specialist. In the circumstances, your "I don't know"... But it's the honest truth. You're slow on the uptake. You'll leave here, go on functioning. but you refuse to help us. What are you working on now? I have a commission for a copper engraving. What does that involve? I copy the sketch on to the plate and enlarge it. What do you use to do that? A burin. Have you ever cut yourself in the process? The burin sometimes slips. But the cut's merely a scratch. Have you ever cut yourself in the neck? No. I've never done anybody an injury. What does this engraving depict? - A man dangling in the air. - Hung? No. As if they'd meant to crucify him but managed to catch hold of only one leg... ...and left him hanging there suspended by it. What sort of poppycock is this? You asked me. Enough. Are your things in the repository? Take this and claim them. You're free to leave. Just like that? What is it? I was told to come here. Are you collecting or depositing? Collecting. Read out the number and the symbol. GZ-565 Wait there! You're not allowed inside. Give me the tag. Mine were different. The number and the symbol tally. But they're not mine. You'd best try them on. Complaints tend to take time. What am I to do? Leave in these? If you want to leave at all, just get going. I say! Wait a minute! You've lost your glasses. Am I right? I did as I should, didn't I? You! Wait a minute! I had cigarettes and matches. The coats not mine, though I had one like it stolen. The cigarettes are the same. Where are the matches? Why did you take them from me? Did you have to steal them?! I can give you another box... Is this your coat? I don't know. I don't like them. Want a light? No thanks. I don't smoke. I only carry them. At night people sometimes need a cigarette. Some drunk, say, or a loony. I can't smoke because it's bad for me. Will you return my matches to me? I'm neither a drunk nor a loony. But I know you and I know that coat. I was told that you were dead, that you were blind. Do you know what cataracts are? Doctors kill people, so death to all doctors! People drift about helplessly... ...like these newspapers tossing about in the wind. All we do is alternate between folly and wisdom. tootheless and spineless! Everything keeps terrifying us! You're no saint either, but the same as all the rest. I'm going in that direction. How about you? Going home? I know where. You're going to him. You have to one day. But remember: he's a criminal! Who do you mean? What has "he" done? Begotten offspring! A brood of them! Not me, honestly, but my brother. He's blind... Such a dreadful affliction! It's not the two of us together. Honestly. Just him. He's blind. How do you know he'll fancy me? Everything will be fine. Believe me! I'll describe your look afterwards. I'll describe them in detail. Very well, but it will cost more. Why? - Scent's expensive. - Why scent? If he can't see, let him at least smell. - A lot more? - Some 50 florins. - Take it or leave it. - It's a deal. Can I come in too? I mean, sit in? It turns you on? No, it's not that. It's just that afterwards... It's a lot of money for us. He likes me to tell him about it afterwards. Over and over. Very well. Come along. Just a second. I've been waiting for you. For me? Yes Why? Don't be alarmed. I've brought you something. I don't need anything. Do you really believe that? This is for you. It's the reason I'm here. What is it? People. Billions of people. I shouldn't accept this. You already have it. I mean, you are alive. You let him go? It was an accident, a mistake. The staff is overworked. It won't occur again. We'll replace the labels with tattoos. So this Pernat is wandering about at large? I'd put it like this: Neo-Pernat has succeeded Proto-Pernat. Is he at least alike? Except for a lowered consciousness We tested that. What about the prototype? We usually liquidate. And in this instance? It was dealt with. I supervised the operation myself. And who was the original Pernat? Does it matter? A jailbird, I believe. Or perhaps a holy man. Excuse me. Have you lost your mind? Don't you recognise me? No...I mean, yes. They let you go... What's the matter? You seem to have changed somehow... Something's odd... They questioned me, but I didn't know what to answer. You knew him better. Knew who? What are you talking about? Dr. Wassora, the oculist. They kept asking about him. What's it to do with me? The murdered man. You really have changed. There's something odd about you. You're sort of different. Why should I know that doctor? You live right next door to each other . I did? Why are you lying? Because of that room? I'm entitled to a larger apartment! Here! It was right here! This is recent! Piss off! Why the fuss? It's all been done officially! I'm entitled to it! It was cleared out. Why leave it? Run along, inform on me! You've got the wrong idea. I didn't know that doctor. I don't know him and I wanted you to - You've changed. I ran into your brother. He said - Lay off him! You know he's sick, suffering, He didn't kill him. He couldn't kill anybody! I know what's changed. You're not wearing glasses. A kilo of potatoes, please. A kilo of potatoes, please. Is something wrong? No, only you remind me of someone... Oh yes, potatoes... You've got to help me, love. I must have that money. I want to get my book back from the pawnshop. - Whatever you have. - You know that's nothing. Be reasonable. It's my book! A part at least. I beg you as a father! I've got to get my book back.... So you're cheating me. Hiding money from me... ...in these dead bodies? What of my book? Where else have you hidden it? Where else have you put it? Father, stop it! I must have that money! My book... Try and calm down. Come along. You're unfair to your daughter. Tell me, who exactly are you? You're in the wrong. She - Who are you? There's no you! I know of these hollow clay shells! There's no you! What do you want? What do I want?! Why this whole deception? I bet you're straw inside. You're an empty shell, admit it! Please try and calm down. If you exist, come along to church and prove it. I'm in funds. I can pay. What church? This is a cinema! Come on, this way. But this is a cinema! No, this is the Church Of The Transfiguration! You clay abortion, this is the only place where you can confess your dreams! Happy Dorm, Happy Dorm! It's the very thing! Sleep from night to morn is what Happy Dorm will bring! Remember: happiness is your obligation. If your features trouble you.... ...modern surgery... ...will help you... solve your problems. So come and see us. Remember: happiness is your obligation. Come and see us. Filthy drunks! Trying to fool me? I can see your legs! You'll pay for everything! The whole mess! Come on out! Right now! Please! I'll be right out. I'll pay for everything. Oh, Mr. Pernat. Give me a hand with this. Here? Anywhere you like. I'll take this corner. Lift! Pernat! You're with him, Pernat? You went to him and surrendered! He's a criminal! Any good with watches? Pernat, I can't look him in eye! Keep quiet! My own father! He's your son? Out of disgust! I want you to mend my watch. Let me introduce you: Mr. Pernat.... My Daddy. Bountiful father, Thanks to you I have this splendid coat. I, a prodigal son. Don't let go... ...of the stove! This coat is almost like yours. A father's gift! Rosanna, do something with him. Are you angry that I refuse your money? Will you shut up! Do you hear me, mindless inseminator? It is I, prodigious procreator, sire of insensate manikins, I, one of your bungled creatures! Do you hear me, progenitor? It is I.... ...your son. Just a few steps more. Here we are. What else do you want? You mentioned a watch. You're going to repair it. You have very deft fingers. But it's working. Yes, but backwards. These hands, which moving rapidly, are all right. But this little one, which is very slow, is going backwards. You've given up wearing glasses, and you can't see. Just take my word for it. You'll repair it. If I can... You'll learn. I understand you're gifted. Your shoulder measurements? Measurements? What do you mean? The width of your shoulders in centimetres. Why do you want to know? I'm just asking. We were to create... ...a new human species, better and tougher. Pernat comes close to the ideal. Let him live normally. Let's not treat him as an experimental rat. Why the bromides? Pernat is a trial run, a pilot model. We can regard him as a test sample, nothing more. Tests, as with rats? Mazes, sweets... He's a human being. What makes you so sure? Don't be alarmed. I'm from the corporation. I've come to test the flues. Is that stove here? What stove? This one? Skip the jokes. I mean the big stove! This is my only room. I don't have any other stove. Then where's the smoke coming from? You're the only occupant of the attic. There wouldn't be space for a second room. Up here there's got to be... ...a big stove, like a baking oven. There isn't one. You can see for yourself. Maybe I can and then again, maybe I can't. And what are you supposed to be? An artist? I just work... And on the side you make... ...artistic knick-knacks out of clay? I told you I've nothing like that. Holtrum may have. He bought a large stove recently. He's the superintendent. Ground floor. I told you clearly enough. It's coming from this level. It's not my business, but you'll burn the place down. Mr. Pernat, you've registered your brother, Why weren't you good enough to inform me? You must be joking. What brother? I've received a new register. There are two Pernats there in black and white. It must be some mistake. Sign this summons. What's it for? A dental check-up. There's nothing the matter with my teeth. Maybe, but according to the records you have a denture. Here too. What do you mean? You don't expect me.... ...to go chasing after the other Pernat? And whether I have a stove or not... ...is none of your bloody business! Come on, Rosanna. She simply lends a hand. I've come here... To get a doll repaired? No, I want to take you away from here for a while. I can't right now. I have to... Just for a moment! You write the owners' names here. No one looks under the wigs. Come on. I can't right now. You see, I have to... You have to what? Father wants to get a book back. I must raise the cash. That book is all that keeps him alive. I'll lend you the money. No.... It was you that slipped that money in? No, it must have been sewn up inside. You're lying. No. I can lend it to you, honestly. I can't accept money from you. I'll lend it to you, but I have to go home for it. How much do you need? Two hundred florins. I'll fetch it. Here you are. Come on in. Don't tell my father I borrowed it from you. Who's that? What's your name? Pernat. Where did you get all that money? Mr. Pernat lent it. You can buy your book back now. Come here a moment. You're selling yourself for me, for your father? No. Nothing like that. Mr. Pernat offered to lend the money. She's selling herself? No. You've got it all wrong. I'm lending the money. Just like that? Who lends money nowadays? Your daughter said it meant a lot to you. So you have a kind heart? I thought you didn't exist, that you're a dummy. So you're different, kind-hearted! I'll bring you my book. It will help you. I know that you need it. We must get it back! It is my view that observation is not enough. Especially as one of the Pernat surveillance team... ...suffered an accident in mysterious circumstances. To hasten the project's progress... ...we should widen the program of physiologico-medical... ...and psychologico-social tests. Please underline the next sentence. The first step should consist... ...of an interim examination in laboratory conditions. Who's here for the check-up? - Name? - Pernat. I was summoned to report for a dental check-up. Show me your teeth. Suffering from toothaches? No, they seem all right. I'm inclined to agree. Please open your left eye. But I'm here for a dental check-up. You opened your right eye. Now open the left. Wider. This was to be a dental check up? Your teeth are okay, so why complain? That's better. Do you have a sense of light? I came for a dental check-up! You were right to. One must keep a check on one's health. I see the beginnings of a cataract. It's lucky you came to see me. Early diagnosis, easier treatment. Now the right eye. There's a cataract for you! Like scales. By rights you should be blind! Sister, hold his head. Just a minor operation to make sure. It will hurt a bit, but I'll give you a certificate. You may have some trouble seeing afterwards. Oh, you gargoyle you! Stay seated, son, you must eat a lot. Why won't you let me out of here? You can't see yourself, so you don't know who you are. You need to eat a lot. Why won't you take me home? You can't see, so you don't know where you live. Eat. Please let me out. Eat, eat, eat, eat! And this? What's this? Um... I... I know... So what? You were to spread pigeon poison on the roof. They shit all over my backyard! Mr. Holtrum... Yes, what? I didn't give it to you to let it just sit there. You're the one living in the attic, not me, I'm not climbing those stairs every day! I... I'll do it... But be careful. Wear gloves. In case you get poisoned yourself. Excuse me. Mended my watch yet? I can see you haven't even opened it. What are you doing? Can't you see? Measuring. Why? A questionnaire. Typical measurements. Raise your arms. Show me your identity card. - Why? - I need the number. You can copy it out of the register. So you don't have one? I'll have a look for it and bring it down. You have a day to find it, Pernat. I want it by tomorrow. By tomorrow. Is that clear, Mr. Pernat? I didn't collect it. - You got a pass. - I claimed only my clothes. Lost identity cards are not our department. I collected my clothes. I must have left the card behind. Your name? - Ashamed of it? - You know my name. You're not feeling well? No. I'm sorry. - So what is your name? Pernat. - Have you changed your name? - No. When you were last here, you had a different name. You're mistaken. And now you want a card in the name of Pernat? Yes. Why are you asking for a card in a name that's not your own? But you questioned me and let me go. I'd like that identity card back. We talked for several hours. your identity being one subject but we arrived at no constructive conclusions. I'm afraid your name is absent... ...from the registers of both the living and the dead. Anything else? I must have an identity card: without one I don't exist. That's not my business. My business is criminals. In any case, I'm through for the day. May I leave? As easily as you came in. You're a free man. Out you go! There you are! I told you that doctors were murderers. You didn't believe me and you still don't. It's my regular mantra: Doctors kill people! Look! Some dummy or other has only to bemoan his fate on the stage... ...and everyone starts weeping! Because sentimentality plays on the riff-raff's feelings. You see that guy? Guess what he'd like to do most? Shove a stick up my arse like a puppet... ...and shake me from side to side! Left, right, left, right!! Why do people flock to the theatre so eagerly? For the hearts and flowers, for proof... ...that they are more sincere and human... ...than the characters on stage! Give this to my father. What is it? Our blood. That should do the trick. "Our"? His blood, but flowing in my veins. I don't want it and I'm giving it back to him. You need a bandage on that! I've worked it out to the tiniest inflection. He must take all this blood... ...and be buried with it. That should get to him! Only schmaltz can still get through to stiffs like him! See he gets this, I beg you! Very well. Thank you! - You promise? - Yes. Thank you. Stiffs... Never leave the key in the lock... ...or they may trap you, my son. I've come as I promised. Is it this book? You should know. - I should? - Yes. It contains everything. Every moment, every occurrence. It's nice of you. Very nice of you to be making the jacket for my book. But it's a book you need more than I do. It contains answers which you alone need. What does this book reveal? The purpose. I don't understand. Many books have described how man was created... ...but there are none... ...which have said why, for what purpose. And the answer's here? Yes, but only for you. Can there be a book... ...which has answers only for me? They're here to be found... ...by anyone using the right vowels. If one can't understand that, one is a fool. Right? Look! I kneel before you. So in the end you're the angel... ...and I'm the devil. Why pick on him? Because he has a self of his own? A society of individuals like him... ...is doomed! It can only disintegrate! Individuality threatens society? What are we talking about? About us! Don't exaggerate. Pernat has hardly suffered. His activeness is rising. Any further increase in awareness... Yes? ...will make him rebel. Is there anything you need? Leave me alone. It's you? Help me. How? What can I do for you? Take me somewhere. Let's go to the movies. Where's the nearest cinema? Cinema? Do you feel like going? Okay. I'll show you the way. I'm sorry you found me crying. It's only human. Well now, shall we go to the movies? Yes, that will be best. Your father hates you. Simply because we're both human. But his children... I'm defective. Or do you find me attractive? Yes... He requires perfection. He thinks we're too unlike him. Can anyone set himself up as a model? I know that he would like to look like you. It's true! You're his ideal type. He's said as much. I'm his ideal type? He despises you for your goodness It's only your body he envies. He says you have the look of a cultured man. He'd like to create an improved version of himself. But he spawns the likes of me, instead of the masterpieces he craves. He's mad. He wants to create life. That oven is everything, can't you see? What are you trying to say? Never mind. Do you find me attractive? Yes indeed! No one's ever taken me to a movie! We don't have to go back! - Stay in a cinema forever? - This is no cinema. It is! It's a movie! Look around you! People! People! All these people! You believe they really exist? Can't you see? Can't you hear? Let's go over there and join them! Cut! It's all make-believe! Rosanna? Where are you? - Quiet! - Quiet! This is the wrong crowd. The other one got lost. What do you mean, "the other crowd got lost"? I mean it's lost. Misplaced. Find it. This one really is all wrong. I can try. I'm looking for a redhead. We haven't any. We were here together. You mean, you came with that crowd on the screen? No no no, that's not what I meant... It's only a film clip! So it is a film? Film?! Hell no! This is television! The girl had red hair... Movies, girls... Trying to convert me? No, I'm looking for a girl. Rosanna. That second clip's vanished. You haven't seen her? Look, I've lost a crowd, got it? Which bit of footage did you escape from? Get out of my hair. I'm working. So what do we do? Has a girl with red hair passed this way? Is something the matter with you? You want to help me? I could fetch a doctor. That's not what I mean. If you want to help me, hand me my hat. It's too far away for me to reach. That's the only thing I can do for you? The only thing? It's what I need most. This hat? Where would I be without it? Do I get it back? I feel better already. You don't wear a hat. That leads to sinus trouble, baldness... Who are you? Background's important, but... ...must we always go back to square one? I'm a guide. A guide to slumberland. This girl had red hair. Have you seen her? You're delirious. Red hair indeed. When you're bald as a coot! Look after your head. My father might need me. Right now he's finishing his book. So he says. That book's empty. You know it's a pipe-dream. You fret over me so... What did your father do when he was younger? Before Mother died? He was a clerk in a record office. He recorded deaths and births. You can't live only for your father. He's unimportant. What matters to me are unexpected gifts. I take after my mother. - When did she die? - Long ago. She was engaged to Holtrum. Your mother? Nothing came of it, luckily. He's a sad case. He wasn't always. I used to go and play with him. He gave me a ring. Don't worry about me. I'm happy here. I want to leave this place. With you. Later my mother came to hate him. He despised her for falling in love with him. But now, when his son has lost his wits... Let's leave. Let's get away as far as we can! Do you believe that one's destiny can be changed? But you believe in pipe-dreams! That book, those gifts - that's all they are! Give me your hand. Why? I want to see your lifeline, your future. I can read palms. That's another of your delusions. - You're afraid? - Nonsense! In that case give me your hand. Let's go. Why? I really am very happy here. This is for me? Specially for me? It was yours and it still is yours. You can take it. You mean it? It's your turn today. You're not alone. You can choose. So I have freedom of choice? You can think you have. Like a rat in a maze. Like an ant that belongs to the ant-hill. Your results... ...have been a let-down. The Pernat has proved a mistake, your mistake. How can you tell? The progress reports. They were my reports. I daresay. Your materials... ...are to be turned in... ...to these gentlemen. The consequences of dicontinuing this program - Allow me to judge... ...the consequences of my decisions. Do you think you're the only team working... ...on this program? A human being can still be made of Pernat. We have a new project for you: breeding carp. What will become of Pernat? Pernat? Who is Pernat? Don't you worry about that. That's not your problem The authorised persons will find the right solution. Mr. Pernat! Come downstairs quickly! I had a message for you... ...but I've completely forgotten it. Mr. Holtrum will be angry. Did you mend the watch properly? He'll be angry with me. Mr. Holtrum! I've brought,,, Where are you? Mr. Holtrum, your son asked me... ...holding a bottle with a dark liquid. Next to him lay the deceased. Does that tally with the statement? Yes. It's been established that the liquid is blood... ...of the same group as the bloof of the deceased. It was not his blood. Look, I have the lab report here. You murdered a man for a mere drop of blood? I've seen some perverts in my time... Or are you perhaps... a blood donor? It was his son's blood. Don't act the religious maniac. Save it for the trial. I'm sure that you're probably insane. Holtrum had no son. Do you refuse to testify? No. Here's how it was. You went in armed with your graver... ...and stuck it in his throat. A big man like him must have been a long time dying. You then filled the bottle.... ...and stole his watch. I did none of that. So this is your story: You went in with his watch and blood... ...and found him dead? Yes? Yes. And sat down beside him? No. First I closed his eyes. - Literally? - Yes. Why? It's the done thing. So when you see a murdered man... ...your first move is to close his eyes? He seemed... ...to be staring at me. I couldn't bear it. But you could bear to murder him... ...and watch his blood flowing into your bottle? Don't worry. I shan't be in the way. I'm leaving soon. - They made you sweat? - No. I confessed and signed a statement. - You confessed? - Why be awkward? You'll probably be released after 48 hours. That depends. What are you supposed to have done? A sex killing, You're kidding. You'll be released tomorrow for sure. I haven't told you the whole truth. You're the last person I'll ever talk to. Tomorrow I get the chop. Want some? Thanks, but I'm dieting. In any case... ...I have to be on an empty stomach. There's no justice. You've been victimised. It's a disease, you mean? I know. You're lying to me. Nevertheless it's true. My only next stop is the grave. So this is death row? Don't let it worry you. The danger lies elsewhere. But this is a hospital. You still have a lot to look forward. Who are you? Does it matter? A saint perhaps, a criminal... Tomorrow I'll be a new and better man. Right now I'm a prisoner. Can't you be clearer than that? You interest me. At present I'm better at it, more precise... I knew at once that of the two of us... ...I'm a goner. Been inside long? Several years. Do you want to know how it was? - How what was? - With that girl. She had a lot of dolls and very fair hair. And a doll is what she serve me as. I did exactly what children do with dolls. They may be suspected of having vicious instincts... ...but show me the child who never ripped open a doll. - What was her name? - Miriam... Yes, I think it was Miriam. I realise... ...how awful it must be to sleep with a man like me. Repository - Depositing or claiming? - I'm leaving. - Let's have the tag. - Here is the tag. Wait there. Without tags there would be chaos... ...and we can't have that. Without tags anyone could come here and help himself. Here you are. You were right. They were not your things. Someone messed up. You remember? It was so long ago. Someone messed up. Different numbers, but the same names. That's very rare. So now I only check the numbers. It was you who issued my things? Did the switch make all that much difference? Close the door. Do you still have my old things? What things? You deposited this coat... ...and it's the one I'm returning. The number tallies and the name tallies. If you don't like it, take it off, go back where you came from... ...and lodge your complaint there. I'm sorry. They're the right things after all. I'll braid your hair with a rosy-red ribbon. Won't that be nice? You'll have ribbons, you'll be fed... You're a good man. You won't hurt my children? You're leaving, aren't you? No! They're my children! Don't be fooled by slanderous whispers. By lies and old wives' tales! Be assured! Don't believe any of these fraudulent stories! Any specious claims and spurious information! The idea that biological experiments on people... ...have been used in a post-nuclear... ...humanity reconstruction program... is absolute rubbish! A lie! A nonsensical affront to common sense! Take my word for it. Subtitles by MENiSCUS
