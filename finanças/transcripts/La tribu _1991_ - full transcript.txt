No, Virginie! -I didn't see her… -Virginie! -Wait… -Virginie… Do something, I'm begging you! EMS 78 Everybody stand back. Please stand back EMERGENCY AMBULANCE VILLERS HOSPITAL CENTRE -Shit! It's a kid! -I always have to treat kids. It will be okay. It'll be okay, ma'am. We'll do everything we can. Careful, doctor, she has cardiac issues. -Cardiac, really? -Yes. -What's her name? -Virginie. -She just ran out… -Virginie. Please, ma'am… We can move her. Virginie. Please calm down. -Calm down. -Why doesn't she talk? -It's barely 90. -I'd say it's the gut, one femur. Virginie. -Virginie? Virginie, stay awake. -The stretcher, quickly! Don't worry. Will she make it? She's not talking… Why isn't she talking? Virginie… Why doesn't she speak? -It'll be okay, ma'am. -Virginie… They're on it. Come on. Let's take her in. Breathe. Breathe.

Road accident, a little girl of seven or eight years. Hit by a truck. Currently in coma stage one. Spontaneous breathing, borderline BP at 90. Internal abdominal bleeding and closed fracture of the right leg. Possible cardiac complications. Let's get moving! Internal injury! We'll take her up now. Gently, there we go. Come on. So? Alright, cardiac rhythm back to normal. Once the BP rises above 120 we'll stop the dobumatine. OPERATING THEATER - NO ENTRY I'd love to bang a midwife just before happy hour. -Like, instead of the peanuts? -Wait, let me help How robust. Great work, Rohan. You really fixed up the little girl. I thought she wouldn't make it, at first. It may seem minor, but they're tough at that age. Yes, only five years ago, we wouldn't have been able to save her. Gentlemen, I'll leave you to your sports. -Maréchal is a weirdo. -You know him? Nah. I never worked with him before. Ah, he mostly does private sector. The pay is better, and… Old dog, you need a nice cold shower! How's it going at your practice? Not so good. Six clients a day, tops. Four on average. It barely covers costs and not every day. So how do you get by? Without the hospital and the shifts, I'd be out of business. How much do you make? Excluding the hospital? 3,000 to 4,000 bucks a month. Huh? Fuck, I'm not ready for my own practice. Oh, that's funny. Stop fucking around! Hey, you're getting a belly. Yeah, a little, but that's life. You're not fucking enough. When do you move in? Since you've been bugging us about it. I don't even know if I'll continue in medicine. Do you see me in a tie rushing up and down the stairs? You'd rather play EMS cowboys? Well, my friend, someone has to pick up bodies on the road. Oh, bastard. We can be useful sometimes, just look at the kid. But there will be another tomorrow. Well, we'll try to be just as good. Yes, but tomorrow is another day we still have tonight, and tonight I'm gonna bang… a midwife. Yes, I know. Could you come tonight, because I'm… I'm starting to get contractions. I don't think it'll be long now. -Huh? There. -Oh, yes. It's coming. I'll leave you to it. As soon as your waters break, let me know. -No, I'm not joking around. -Off you go. She didn't say that last time. It's really not… Absolutely, he said that to get rid of my cellulite, the only solution was to operate. He said, some sort of… Suction… of the legs, of the thighs, in fact. Yes, do you mean liposuction? Excuse me ma'am, exactly how old are you? Well, I'm nearly 69. And do you show your thighs often? You know, in Pornichet, once or twice, my husband likes it. Why spend a fortune on surgery? Just go on a diet. But in Pornichet my husband… Thank you, ma'am and thank you Dr. Escoulap for your sound advice. It's nearly time for him to go, unless… you have anything to add Dr. Escoulap? Yes, a question has been on my mind. Please, go ahead. I think many of our listeners are worried too. Do you wear a bra or are your breasts just pert? Yes. And naturally, I won't answer this indiscreet question which ends our session. Greetings from Laurence Aliéri. See you next Tuesday, same time, for another Put Your Foot in It. Bye. DR. OLIVIER ROHAN, GENERAL MEDICINE Hello? Yes, Dr. Rohan's office, I'm listening. Yes, please hold the line, Dr. Rohan is busy, I'll see if he can talk. At this hour… Oh shit, half nine. It's a medical rep wanting a meeting. Dr. Rohan speaking, yes? Good morning. Yes, I know IPC Laboratories. Oh, just a moment… My schedule is very busy, I need to check my diary. Stop Laurence, please. Stop that. Right. I can slip you in between two patients Friday at 11, if that suits? Perfect, noted. Miss… Lisbeth Mahler? The physician? I'm sorry. No, you're a real pain. See you on Friday then. Perfect. Good evening. Sorry, I mean good day. You're annoying… Got lots of appointments Friday? Gosh… Almost as many as this morning. And this morning? Got a lot of appointments this morning? Yes. I have a very interesting client. Doctor… -I have a pain there… -Where? -There. -Ah, hold on. Is anything there? -Lower… Lower… Yes, there… -There? DISTRICT HOSPITAL CENTRE -So? -Oh… It's you! With the flashing light, I didn't recognize you. I'll open the barrier for you now. -Good morning. -Hi Olivier. Rules are rules. The casualty doctor said to sign in here. But I can't do it without your number. I'll go up and see him now. The rules? Your rules… -But it's not my fault… -Don't worry, come on. We'll take care of you. Whoops. This way. So on the rocks, you see… That's me. And that's Sophie. She's nothing special… She's covered in cellulite! Were you admitted? Still being zealous, Cazenave? I'm only following orders from above. Did they make you forget you're a doctor too? Will you sew him up or shall I? Have a seat there. Cool, Cazenave. Flexible. Hey! Come on, back to work! Hello lovebirds. How are you? Hey! How are you? Off, off… No underwear. Take that off. -Wait… -Here. Yes… -I'm taking it off! -No! Come on! GRATEFUL HUMANITY TO THE TRIBE MEMBERS DANIEL MARTINEZ GONE TO THE ENEMY What happened to him? -AIDS. -Why? Martinez wasn't queer. No, he wasn't queer, he didn't even do drugs. Work accident. He was unlucky. Hot stuff, coming through! Can someone grab my balls? Yes, there we go! -What's wrong with you? -Yuck, you're not wearing underwear! Holy cow… That's disgusting… That's gross… Go get dressed Well, the tennis on Friday is gonna be awesome. We'll see. What the hell is this? Off to the beach? I'm waiting for my gladiator suit. I bet you used to have huge parties at the halls? Parisian grazers from the West. That could be cool? You were still laughing, right? -Why don't you laugh? -It's not the same Roosens speaking. Yes. How many are injured? Oh… A crash. Where? I'll be right there. Bye, guys, an EMS doctor is needed on the highway. -Mandarin! -Fuck off! ANESTHESIA AND RESUSCITATION SERVICE That guy is awesome. You have a real gang in the tribe. I'd have loved to be with you. You're a dummy, de Sarte. Parisian grazers from the West, that was just folklore, a show. You'll see the oldies at tennis on Friday. In their little suit jackets surrounded by chicks. The tribe. The tribe doesn't exist anymore. If it ever existed. -It's you and François… -François is addicted. He's an EMS addict with nowhere else to go. I only work holidays for the dough. Only for the dough, got it? Hey, de Sarte. -Do you like martial arts? -A bit. Two little mousses! Cardiology, yes. The ICU? I'm coming. Let Étienne know. Okay. It's moving on both sides. Stop the massage, Étienne. Carry on. Get me two milligrams of adrenalin. Leave it. She's been pale for five minutes. Are you sure? She had a massive pulmonary embolism Shit, stop before you break her ribs. Fucking death. Fucking life, huh. I thought about it. So? That pulmonary embolism? -Botched. -Oh dear. What did you expect? Poor Mrs. Chéron was nearly 80. -And you can't save them all, you know. -If only. -Do you know Dr. Roussel? -Of course. Rohan is one of our best people. -You have a new practice in town, right? -Yes. How's that going? -So so… -If you need any help, let me know. We often need a hand starting out. Right? Thank you. Ah, town council in 20 minutes, I must go. Alright. Go easy on yourself. One patient lost, ten saved. See you later. He seems to like you. It's an offer to take up; he's a Medical Council member with a lot of political support. In his spare time he also practices a bit of medicine. Think again; he's a good doctor. We're lucky he's at the town hall because he really defends us. So… Thankfully I came to see you, doctor. -When was the coil fitted? -In December, doctor. You come every two months? The doctor said it was to clean the wire. What do you pay per consultation? 380 francs, Social Security doesn't refund it. Is it too much, doctor? Listen ma'am, a word of advice for you. Change your gynecologist. But he seems very good. I read the article in Marie Claire, it said he was one of the best in Paris. Indeed, he's very conscientious. As this is totally pointless, basically. It's your decision. Your prescription. Thanks doctor. How much do I owe you? -100 francs, ma'am. -600 francs? No, 100 francs. Thank you. Any problems, do come back. Understood. -I will see you out. -Thanks. Thanks very much. -Bye doctor. -Bye ma'am. Do you have an appointment miss? I called you on Wednesday. Lisbeth Mahler from IPC Laboratories. Oh, yes, yes… You're early but that's good. This way please. -Are you German? -You noticed? You have a slight accent. I'm actually here to lose it and to perfect my French. And how long have you been repping? Six months. We need to make some money. Could we talk about the products? Why not? Let's get it out of the way. This new drug is aimed at female clients and a pathology which is very common at a consultation in town. Venous insufficiency syndrome. Then I'll stop you right there. If there's one product I don't want to hear about at all, it's that. Oh really. What's your prescription to a woman with blue legs? Any venotonic will do. Well, in this case, we will offer you a study. Paid, of course. It depends on the type of study, if the protocol is valid. I was just about to suggest that you come talk to Mr. Gener, our regional director. There's a dinner next Tuesday at 8 p.m. Are many going? The study is planned for 12 doctors in the sector. Does that work for you? Hello. Dr. Rohan? Yes, Dr. Roussel speaking. Maurice Roussel, yes. How are you? Very well, thank you. I'm calling about a shift I can't cover. I thought you might be interested, difficult times and all… Young peers need help. I'm sorry, do you mean tonight? Yes, I have a very important meeting in Versailles. My usual replacement has let me down at the last minute. Thank you for thinking of me, but… No, it's me that should be thanking you. I'm glad to count on you. So it's agreed, I'll redirect the calls onto your line? Thank you very much. Hello? Old bastard. Faced with the divided majority and the weakened opposition, the list of the extreme right led by Hubert Castaing seems very well placed to win these by-elections. Hubert Castaing would then confirm the exceptional popularity he enjoys in our region. After the politics, the dance, this evening… Does it hurt there? A pain. I fell down the stairs. Would you turn the TV down? When you fell, did you pass out? No, I don't think so. He didn't move for five minutes, that's when I called you… He gave me a fright. Ah, if you didn't drink so much… I told you I was drinking, only the wine! And the pastis? Pastis, pastis, that doesn't count. It was before dinner… Apparently there's nothing wrong. But come to the hospital to be X-rayed. Your wife is right. You shouldn't drink so much. But I don't drink a lot, doctor. Barely a quart of wine, and still. With food. That's not bad for you. It's a bit too much. -Take a pill before bed. -With a bit of hot wine? No, with water. How much do I owe you, doctor? 260 francs, ma'am. Do you see what your bullshit costs us? Is 250 alright? -Let me call my practice. -Yes, of course… Hello, Roussel? It's Sylvain. I'm at La Ménardière. Come right away, there's a problem with the kid. He collapsed. It's ten past eleven. Hurry up, buddy. Rohan? What are you doing here? I'm covering Dr. Roussel's shift. No, I called Maurice because… he's an old friend but if I'd known you were covering… I would never have bothered you. Please, come in. Come this way. Upstairs. Is it a family member? No, an old friend's son from the province. He came to Paris for a few days… After dinner he started to feel unwell. He was nauseous and covered in sweat… That's why I called Roussel. Come on, it's this way. Food poisoning? That's what I thought initially but… As he hasn't vomited, I don't think so. -How old is he? -Sixteen. -Does he have a medical history? -Not to my knowledge. Mr. Castaing, this is Dr. Rohan He's doing Roussel's shift. Oh really? Come in, doctor. Thanks for coming. You're welcome, it's natural. You're not well? -What's your name? -His name is Gilles. Blood pressure is a bit low, barely 90. Pulse is slightly irregular. Does it hurt there? -Any chest pain? -No, it's gone. Have you ever had an ECG? Before the appendicitis operation. Okay. He's not on any medication? No, I don't think so. The ECG is substantially normal. There are a still a few extrasystoles. Can we reach his parents? It's difficult as they are traveling. That's why he's here. It'd be wise to keep him in hospital for 24 hours. Yes, but I would rather keep him here. If you have anything to give me in case he has a relapse… It's hard to treat him without a minimum checkup… We'll see Roussel tomorrow. So what if… it starts again tonight? Then we'll call you, my friend. He's very emotional. Besides, if his parents were here, they would prefer him to stay with us. You know it's delicate without observation? Rest assured; I will stay here. I'll see you out. Well, Gilles, rest well. If it starts again, tell Dr. Maréchal right away. Okay. This way. Thank you, Rohan. Thanks for coming doctor. Maréchal is a bit panic-stricken. He's very attached to little Gilles. Oh, by the way, how much do I owe you? You're being silly. Among peers… No medical note. -No need. Here, thanks for coming. -No, there's no need… It's Rohan, don't you recognize me? If we had to recognize everyone, we'd never manage it. Rules are rules. I'll let you in now. Come on. How did it go? Commission? Good evening, it's the doctor on duty. You haven't had a call for half an hour now? Okay. I'll finish my shift at the hospital. From now on, if you need to, you give the hospital number. Thanks. Yes, good night. -You sleep here? -Yeah. Fancy a coffee? Thanks, I'm worn out. I'll try to nap before I'm called. That's a shame. For once we had time to talk a bit. Another time. Bye. -Fucking hell, Olivier! -Sorry… -You could have knocked! -I'm sorry. Here we go again! ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY What? But where is your intensivist? Okay, okay. I'm coming. The line is flat. Get me two milligrams of adrenaline. Take the mask off. Intubate him. His name is Gilles. He's going back into V-tach. I'll shock him. Resume the massage until Étienne puts the probe in. Disconnect the ECG. It'll be done in a minute. -The ECG is off? -Yes. Careful, nobody touch the bed. The probe is in place. I'll shock him once. Nothing. Again, get the dobutamine. A 20 ml vial. That's it, it's back on. It looks like a heart attack? At his age? Or the electric shock? -No way, an electric shock doesn't… -Shit, fibrillation again. Alright, I'll shock him again. The gel. -ECG disconnected? -Disconnected. Stand clear. Shit… More massage? You know it's no use. -Who brought him in, the EMS? -No, it was Maréchal. -Maréchal? -Yes. I was there when he arrived in his car. Why didn't he call the EMS? He found him lying in the car park when he came in to the hospital. 200 meters away. It's always the same with the junkies… They overdose, their friends freak out and dump them at the entrance. He was dumped too far away. We were lucky Maréchal saw him. -Have we got his ID? -Stéphane de Maniez. -Stéphane? -Yes. Stéphane de Maniez, born October 6th 1975. 15, can you believe it? What do I put for cause of death? Heart attack. -Is Maréchal here? -Yes, he was just here. Is Maréchal around? He only had a minor intervention this morning. He left. -Where can I find him? -He must be at his clinic. -Which clinic? -Glycines. Want the number? Glycines Clinic. I'm sorry, Dr. Maréchal is not here today. But you could try calling his office. You're welcome, bye. Ah, he's not coming to the office today? Okay, I'll try to reach him at home. Thanks. Hello switchboard? It's Dr. Rohan. Do you have Dr. Maréchal's landline please? It's very urgent. I'll wait, thanks. Yes, this is Dr. Maréchal's house. You can reach my husband at the hospital or the clinic now. You're welcome. Goodbye. Can we start? The purple coloration of the thorax is because of the prolonged cardiac massage. It seems that perhaps two ribs are broken, also because of the cardiac massage. Bukovsky. Could I have your scalpel? Want the window open? No, I kept the room warm. We'll get cold if we open it. So you can die of asphyxiation or cold. Bukovsky, the costotome. No traces of atheroma in the large vessels. Normal for his age. The heart appears to be normal. Hemorrhagic fluid in the pericardium in small amounts. Compatible with the trauma of the massage. It won't be long now. Excuse me. And this morning he didn't come and meet us. Hey. Good timing. The parents of De Maniez are here. Will you see them? I'd better do this alone. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, I'm Dr. Rohan. -Good morning. -Good morning. Please follow me. -This way please. -Thank you. Have a seat. Please, excuse us, doctor, we just came to collect his things. Could we see Stéphane one last time? Of course. We did all we could. I'm very sorry. Thank you doctor. He was a nice boy, Stéphane. Always very considerate. Yes, he was a good son. Did your son have a history of cardiac issues? No, never. He never had any problems at school? With drugs, for example. Oh, no. He didn't even smoke. You can ask Dr. Maréchal, he was looking after Stéphane. -How long for? -Two or three years. We are from Royan. We are the housekeepers of Mr. Castaing's villa. The doctor came often on holiday. So you entrusted your son to Mr. Castaing? Yes, doctor. He was taking care of his studies. These cardiac illnesses are so sudden… Very sudden, yes. I'm sorry. I hope I'm not disturbing you. No, no. Not at all. Thanks for the other night. -There's really no need. -Yes, there is. I'm very grateful for your efficiency. And your discretion. Yes. I was told you had some difficulties in running your practice? Let's not exaggerate… It's totally normal. We've all been there. That's not the point. I've decided to give you a hand. I work at Dumanège clinic. A vacancy has just come up. I thought it would definitely suit you. Two or three afternoons a week. It's basically supervision. It's very well paid. It's very sudden, listen… I never thought of going private… At 700 francs per shift you could make… around 9000 a month. Not including the rest. It's a surprise, I don't know… You don't have to decide now. Think about it? Give me a call. Okay? Okay. I'll think about it. Let's keep all that between us. Thank you. So glad we've understood each other. See you soon. Yes! That's it, eh! Oh shit… Apply yourself. Yes! Alright I've had enough, you suck. Come on, we're done. -Huh? -You're no fun. You suck! -Laurence, it's only been five minutes! -Yes. I'm too hot. What a hypocrite… So, did he offer you money? No, not directly. Worse than that, he offered me a job at Dumanège. For doing fuck all. Nearly ten K a month, not bad for two hours? Yes, super. If you're not disgusted. Disgusted by what? Here. Read this. Page 23. Roussel fully explains his ideas on AIDS. He even mentions diseases by immigrants. He's pushing for New France. NO VISA FOR AIDS I agree that stinks, but so what? So he really doesn't want to be involved in the death of a… good little French boy. That's why he tried to buy you. You thought it was for your pretty blue eyes, teddy? Fuck their lies. I don't want a fuss. But you stepped right into their lies. You're the first to shout out about anything shady, but you let that kid croak for 2000 bucks. I don't get it. So what do I do? Go say sorry to the Medical Council? I'm not asking so much, teddy bear. Enough talking for today, okay? Okay, big chief. I'll take you out for dinner. Okay? Yes, what about my show? -What do you know? -I like that. -And your dinner with the laboratory? -Oh shit, I'd forgotten… Diffuveynil therefore offers you an unusual prescription option in the already crowded venotonic arena. Firstly it is only one dose a day, secondly there are no side effects, and thirdly, in comparison to reference products, the results are similar or even better, and it costs less. And best of all, a trip to Venice with the lady. So listen carefully. I'm offering a trip for two to Venice, I'm giving two tickets away, you do the rest, I don't want to know. -So there you have it. It's great. -Yes! Excuse me. It could be good… You haven't specified the observations to be provided. Ah yes, the observations… So. Fifty per doctor, but I can assure you now, they are specially designed so that minimum time is wasted, you just tick the boxes on the form, our computer will do the rest. What about remuneration? For those not taking the trip. Yes, so, obviously, the remuneration is not as interesting in fiscal terms but you can also choose a check for 4000 francs for taking part in this deliberately simplified study. Deliberately simplified to make us prescribe Diffuveynil by way of… -Oh no! -Oh! No… Please, sir. While you're free to your opinion, your more experienced peers don't seem to share it. Oh. My peers don't share much. Excuse me, doctor. If this study doesn't interest you, why are you here? I'm asking myself that. This guy is crazy! Gentlemen sellouts, good evening to you. He doesn't belong here! He doesn't belong here at all. Welcome to Skyrock. Evening all. It's Laurence Aliéri here with an exclusive report this evening. Politics, medicine and property, can they know each other in the biblical sense? You don't see the link. So I will tell you a lovely story. Once upon a time there was a political man to the right of the right, a savvy developer. He decided to join forces with two distinguished doctors in our region… Oh, idiot. …to create an American-style super polyclinic for the sick but wealthy. One beautiful summer's eve, the unpredictable grain of sand slips into the machine. Shit! Again. This isn't happening… Fucking unbelievable… Asshole! Bastard. Are you Don Quixote? It's stupid, but I'm out of petrol. It's definitely not your day. Are you getting in? Stupid thing, really. May I? …of medical architecture. So I'll leave you to name the characters of this enlightening story. I wish you all a good night. Don't forget our date with the good Dr. Escoulap and his sound advice. Sweet dreams. Thank you. Do you go on the radio often? Dr. Escoulap? Ah, you know? Imagine that my job is precisely knowing everything about the doctors in the field. You didn't answer. Do you go on the radio often? Whenever the woman I love asks me to. The woman you love? See? You don't know everything. The woman I love hosts the show. It's running! Listen… How about I buy you a drink to thank you? Sorry, but I'm already late. Someone is waiting for me. Ah. Your husband? No. The babysitter. I also have a man I love. Ah right… And he has a babysitter. Of course. He's my son and he is four. Well, call your babysitter. No, I don't like that. And he had a bit of a fever tonight. An excellent opportunity to prove what a great doctor I am. It's a bit red but not too bad. You keep warm and get some sleep. You'll get some syrup tomorrow. You like it? Now Jérémy, time to sleep. Bye, pirate. -I'm not a pirate! -That's good, neither am I. Now sleep. Go to sleep Jérémy? Two spoonfuls… morning… afternoon… -and evening. -Thank you. What do I owe you, doctor? How about… a dinner that's more fun than the one tonight. You are one strange doctor. So dinner? Okay. Dinner. -Could you get me some water? -You're awake? Yes, can't you tell? I can't sleep without you. What about the meeting? How was it? It went very well, I left before the end. What a bunch of assholes. Lucky you left early, look at the time. You won't believe it; I ran out of petrol. I forgot to fill up. My poor teddy bear… I used to say you'd forget me one day. No chance. I even heard you on the road. Did you like it? What are you up to? I wasn't up to anything, but I still got in trouble. After the show, the boss called me into his office. Was it bad? The show has been suspended until further notice following a call from Mr. Castaing. No? Castaing called me in the day after tomorrow. -Do you want to go? -Yes, obviously. Not enough trouble yet? I didn't know it was your birthday! Something is in preparation; you won't be disappointed. The age of Christ calls for a drink! Yeah. You'd better not to show up at the halls before tonight. SUPERVISION DOCTORS -Hi. -Hi. Listen… I've got some news on that kid's heart attack. Maréchal operated on his appendicitis a year and a half ago. So what? Don't you find that an extraordinary coincidence? He finds a guy he had operated on, brings him in but didn't recognize him. If you think that, you're wasting your time. Are you kidding? I'm even doing my thesis on it. That's all we need. Do you see? That heart attack is a great thesis topic. You think your thesis will bring that idiot back to life? You're a pain, Étienne! I'm sorry. But Dr. Léman said I would leave today! It's pointless! It's pointless, come on! Étienne. I'm sorry. I was an idiot. Yeah. It doesn't matter. It does! I thought the same ten days ago. Why? Imagine that kid… I examined him a few hours before he came in. Do you know who called me? Maréchal. ABDOMINAL SURGERY Emmanuelle. Take this for me, I'm off. Sorry to disturb you. I'm Étienne de Sarte, if you don't know me. I was a medical student on duty when you left that kid at A&amp;E. I've done a thesis on his death; I thought you could help me. I don't see how… But anyway, if I can be of use… Actually, it's a quite coincidence, as you seem to know him. You operated on his appendicitis on November 18th, 1986 at Montjoie clinic. -Remind me his name. -Stéphane de Maniez. You obviously didn't recognize him, appendicitis is so banal… No recollection. However, there was an issue with the anesthesia that day… Dr. Vidal, the anesthetist, noticed a cardiac arrhythmia a few minutes after incision. I don't remember. I thought I'd ask you for details; Dr. Vidal left the area shortly after. Yes, I think he left for a teaching job in the provinces. At Orléans university-- I'm sorry I can't help you but I have no memory of the intervention. I have to go to the clinic, I'm late already. Good bye. I'm sorry! Mr. Castaing is waiting for you. Please follow me. You know that we could sue you for slander. Can I smoke? If you really must. You can file a complaint but I didn't mention any names. The allusion was transparent. You recognized yourself immediately. You should know that our companies contribute over 50% of advertising revenue at the radio station that employs you. "Employ", it's a big word. I volunteer. The director is a friend. So if you really want your show to go on, stop your voluntary provocations. If you ban my shows, I'll go elsewhere. Your radio isn't the only way to communicate. I repeat, young lady, we have nothing to blame ourselves for. All our activities are strictly legal. -In the absence of morality. -Morality is relative. In any case, ours is not rooted in slander. And Stéphane de Maniez, was his death moral? Why wasn't he admitted? What are you implying? Failure to help someone at risk of death, especially a minor. It's kind of… pathetic, for a clinic promoter, no? Young lady, we have nothing more to say. For now, Mr. Castaing. Just you wait until my report is finished. Goodbye, young lady. And now let's all sing together! Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday dear Olivier Happy Birthday to you Give us a hug! Laurence has been hurt! -Laurence has had an accident! -Is it serious? Yes, come on! Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday dear Olivier Laurence! Laurence! No! Let go of me! Let go of me! No… -No! -Go on! No! -No… -What happened? She must have lost control of her car. She crashed into a tree. The cops said a tire blew out. Laurence… LES GLYCINES MEDICAL CENTRE Well done again. -See you soon. -See you soon. You must admit, it's bad luck. Slamming into a tree on the way out. Well, accidents happen every day. Perhaps, but after what she said on the radio… The rats are sure to make connections. FACULTY OF MEDICINE In summer, in the open air, insect eggs can be found in the corners of the eyes and mouth and in the nostrils. The larvae hatch within 48 hours. And a new generation of flies will emerge in two weeks. The coleopterans insects at the back are advised to settle down! Thank you. I'll remind you that any one of you may be required by the judicial authority to produce a medical cause of death certificate. That's why we will start with the chapter on maggots. Come on you maggots! Doctor Vidal? Yes? What can I do for you, young man? Étienne de Sarte. Resident at Villers Hospital. You worked with Dr. Maréchal, no? Why? I'm writing a thesis on the recent death of an adolescent. For the Villers intensive care service. How is Maréchal involved? The boy was operated on by Dr. Maréchal for appendicitis. What was the boy's name? Stéphane de Maniez. The day before the operation, I came in for a routine check-up in the patient's room. That's where I made the biggest mistake of my life. What do you mean? I didn't knock before entering. So what happened? There was a guy in the room who was doing things to the sick boy, touching him in a manner that was not medical. Immediately, I ordered him to leave, which he did. But I went straight to speak to Maréchal about it. Maréchal was very annoyed, and with good reason. The guy is the room was Hubert Castaing. I recognized him then. So for seeing something that I shouldn't have seen, young man, is how I ended up here. -I don't understand. -It's actually very simple. Eight days later, I was fired from the clinic and forbidden from practicing. -Because of that? -Of course not. Officially, it was on the grounds of alcohol. Why didn't you say anything? Nobody would have believed me. A drunk, just think… So there you go. Now I teach medicine of the dead. The one we call legal. DR. OLIVIER ROHAN, GENERAL MEDICINE Olivier! Olivier! Olivier! Olivier… Shit. Are you okay? Olivier, snap out of it. Leave me alone. Go away. Have you taken anything? Medication? I just want to be left alone. They killed her, I'm sure of it. She met with Castaing just before. Do the cops know? They think it was an accident. A tire blow-out. What if we tell them Vidal's story about Castaing and the kid? They won't care about the kid. All cops want is a quiet life. Like me eight days ago. It's all my fault. I should never have told Laurence. Never. I dream of her every night. Then I wake up, forgetting that she's not here. And I'm alone. Alone. Alone. Okay… To start off I'll get you some food. If you want. I can't stand this place anymore. FOR A NEW, FREE AND PROSPEROUS FRANCE LET'S ALL VOTE FOR HUBERT CASTAING LOCAL ELECTIONS FOR A NEW FRANCE LET'S ALL VOTE FOR HUBERT CASTAING Waiter! Another bottle of Côtes du Rhône. If you'd be so kind. That's it, Olivier, you're wasted. Let's go. No, I don't want to. No, I'm thirsty. -How much do I owe you, sir? -360 francs, sir. No, leave it. It's on me. Before you pay, you should always check it, right waiter? -Of course, sir. -Fucking hell… Crazy, we're being robbed. Sometimes we even get thrown out. Sir, you've had enough for tonight, please leave quietly. Please see these gentlemen out. Come on sir. -Be gentle… -Please, sir. Okay, stop. Come on gentlemen. I do apologize, this has never happened before. "Please see the gentlemen out"… Screw you! See how fast I'm walking. Where did I put my keys? My keys are in the right pocket… It's that bastard… -What are you doing, jerk? -Cleaning the walls! If you carry on, we'll clean up your face! Stop! I wanted to say sorry about your friend. -I heard about your unfortunate accident… -It wasn't an accident. -What are you saying? -Castaing had Laurence killed. You know very well he had me beaten up last night. My poor friend, you are totally delirious. -Why would he? -What about the kid that died? What about it? I don't see the link. You examined him, no? Yes. But he thought he had called you. Listen… Maréchal was determined to avoid hospitalization. Fine. If the diagnosis was wrong, you're just as responsible as him. Maréchal brought Stéphane to hospital. Pretending he was found on the street. All to protect your friend Castaing. I think you're extremely depressed. And you have reason to be. The grief, the attack yesterday evening… And then the alcohol. Nearly two grams when you arrived. Fuck off. If the Medical Council knew, it would be embarrassing. Fuck off! Very embarrassing. Think about it. Okay. Get some rest. You'll need it. So, what is it this time? That idiot Rohan is convinced we had his girlfriend murdered. He's totally crazy. -There's more, Hubert. -Ah, it gets better and better. I think he knows about you and… Stéphane. And that silly little girl was on about a report when she came. What's the matter Maurice? Nothing, I just feel off… It will pass. Isn't it hot here? It's the same for everyone. Nobody wants to be in hospital. Listen, Simon… I have a big speech in Versailles tonight… I need something to get through it. I'm asking as a friend. You will butcher your coronary arteries. and you're asking me, as a friend, to help you kill yourself, right? I'll come back in the morning if I must but I can't mess up the speech tonight! Castaing needs me; he'd take it so badly. Ah, yes. I'd forgotten your move to the far right. Well, you weren't so picky when we helped you fund the new equipment. Yes, but at that time, Castaing hadn't made any antisemitic statements. But New France has never been an antisemitic movement. The Jews among us are proof. Prof. Bettoun for example. He's a regional manager. Bettoun, is your token Jew. Your interview in Le Quotidien was worth reading. Can you say AIDS without feeling sick? What would you do? Kiss the queers on the mouth? Doctors' concerns need a voice. Why can't a Jew like Bettoun have a duty to say these things? Anyway, that's your problem. In the meantime, I insist on keeping you under observation immediately. I don't want to be admitted, Simon, I refuse. Give me a solid prescription, I'll walk out on my own two feet. Okay, do what you like then, but you sign a discharge note, you get dressed and then you go to your meeting. I just hope that the Versailles EMS arrives on time. The overwhelming rise of the Islamist movement in North African countries bringing to our doors a veritable invasion of so-called refugees of all kinds, divided into fratricidal tendencies but united in a common hate of the French. NEW FRANCE And now, my dear friends, allow me to introduce doctor Maurice Roussel. He's put his heart into our movement. A round of applause for Dr. Maurice Roussel. Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends. I'm known for being straight to the point and tonight, as usual, I won't beat about the bush. I'm speaking as a doctor. If we truly want to resolve the issues of insecurity, drug abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS, the deficit of social insecurity, the only realistic policy is that which New France recommends, a total halt to immigration! Because we want a strong France! Call an ambulance, quickly! I'm sorry… -You're still here? -I waited for you. You haven't heard the good news? Roussel was brought in during my shift. What's wrong with him? I put him in intensive care for the night. Shit… Come in. -My dear colleague… -I'm not your dear colleague. -You're crazy. You have no right… -I have every right here. You're right. I am crazy. Since Laurence was crushed against a tree. It wasn't my fault. Nor Castaing's. You have to believe me, it was accident. -Just as she was leaving Castaing. -A coincidence… A coincidence you and Castaing set up. Calm down, Dr. Roussel. After extrasystoles, agitation is not recommended. Look at Stéphane de Maniez. he had extrasystoles too in the night. The next day, he was in the morgue. That was an accident too. You know I wasn't even there. Why was Maréchal there? Castaing had him, he took photos of him with adolescents. Maréchal really loved Stéphane. There was a real fondness. -With Castaing there? -Castaing… That's different. Stéphane was scared of him, every time he came, he… He got high on TCE. Castaing took advantage of him. All in the name of a clean and fraternal France. Well done. You will call Maréchal. and tell him I demand a confession in writing by morning. I can't do that… Careful Roussel, as long as you're here I could put anything in your drip and nobody would know a thing. Except you. It'll be too late. No way. I don't understand, Roussel, do you realize what you're asking? Yes, alright. I'll think about it. I'll keep you posted. -Another problem? -Yes and no, hospital bullshit. FOR THE ATTENTION OF… DISTRICT HOSPITAL CENTRE CARDIOLOGY, OLIVIER ROHAN -Good morning. -Good morning. -How are you? -Fine. -Have you heard? -About what? Maréchal. He was found dead in his car, parked outside A&amp;E. How did he die? Officially it was a stroke. He's in autopsy now. It's a pain for my thesis, he could have helped. I'm afraid you'll have to find another thesis topic. Open this. Oh fuck… You said it. Anyway, it's incomprehensible! Just as it was all falling into place… Maréchal really was weak in character. But all the same. It's surely because of that bastard Rohan. He came to insult me yesterday. He wanted to go to the cops. -He even threatened to kill me. -And you didn't report it? I have no proof, and I… I thought it'd make you look bad. We seriously need to deal with him. I just found out that Rohan is on duty tomorrow evening at his office. I thought someone from your entourage… could teach him a lesson… Roussel… Who do you take me for? New France is not the mafia. As far as I know? -I slept well, my dear… -Stop it! By the way, what did the autopsy say? Do we know exactly how Maréchal died? Tran found traces of a jab in the fold of the right arm, but officially it was natural causes. So as not to stir things up. To ease his wife's pain. Hey, could you cover my shift in town tonight? Laurence's parents are in Paris. I'm seeing them to the station. Laurence… But I'm on duty tonight for for my nephew's birthday. If I don't show up it'll be bloody. Thanks, François. Give it a rest, shit! -It's okay. -And your groupie, just ask him. Étienne? He's never been on duty. Well then, it's time he started. Why not? You're right… Hey, Étienne… -Could you do me a favor? -Of course. Can you cover my shift in town tonight? You think I'm capable? It's no more complicated than a shift in A&amp;E. You should take the plunge. You'll make a bit of dough. Ok, how does it work? Take my car. Take a seat in my office. When I get back, I'll take over. -Fuck. -Indeed. Hey, you weren't easy to find. But here I am. You don't need me anymore? He's dead because of me. I sent him to be killed. It could have been you or me if I'd covered for you. But I was the target. What do you know? Étienne must have refused to prescribe for a junkie, it happens often. Come on. Come on, let's go. AMPHITHEATER If I had admitted the kid the other night… we'd all be fine. Olivier, that kid snorted anything, he would've died sooner or later. -By chance it happened to you. -By chance? It's easy to call it chance. -So what about Castaing? -Leave it. Yes… Yes, you're right. Forget everything and start over. Castaing will continue to prosper and I'll go back to my office -praying all will be okay. -What will you do, shoot Castaing, join the legion or go to Afghanistan -with Doctors Without Borders? -They serve a purpose! It's for losers, come back to reality! What is reality? Playing cowboys on the roads like you? Pen-pusher medicine, doing services like Cazenave? Or being a crook like Roussel? What? I'm sorry but a cowboy is needed now on the road. Alright. See you later, my friend. Don't be an idiot with Castaing. What's going on? What do you want? What is it? Who's there? It's Maurice. Please open the door, Hubert. What are you up to Rohan? Start writing. "I, Hubert Castaing, "representative of New France, "hereby step down from the elections for personal reasons." Never. Never? I have nothing to lose, Castaing. You won't be safe anywhere, Rohan. We have friends all over. Write. "I… "I, Hubert Castaing…" Seventeen, two. And no pension. Well, they'll raise it to eighteen, six, do you follow me? At eighteen, six, she will be 63. -Rubbish. -Shut your mouth. -Yes, but still… -Shut your mouth! You can read it. What's wrong? You were right. The tribe is finished for me. -Afghanistan? -No, no places left. Burma. Yeah… You're lucky. They seem prettier over there. You see? I recognized you this time. I opened the barrier for you. VILLERS HOSPITAL CENTRE JUNIOR DOCTOR O. ROHAN Subtitle translation by: Natasha da Silva
