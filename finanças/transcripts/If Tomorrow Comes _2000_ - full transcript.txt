[ Gunshot ] Narrator: "If Tomorrow Comes." ** Warrick: Hey, Adam, it's your dad. I thought I might come by and see you, you know, check out the new house. Maybe we'll go get some food. We'll hang out or something. [ Tape rewinds ] Hey, Adam, it's your dad. I thought I might come by and see you, you know, check out the new house. Maybe we'll go get some food. We'll hang out or something. [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Whispering ] Who's that, Dad? That's your mom. Wow! I got a mommy? [ No audio ] [ Tape rewinds ] Hey, Adam, it's your dad. I thought I might come by and see you, you know, check out the new house. Maybe we'll go get some food. ** [ Indistinct conversations ] You have pretty eyes. [ Chuckles ] Thanks. Let me thank you with a lap dance. No, thanks. -She's not here yet, Adam. -Yeah, but have you seen him? I told you, hon. I'll call you when he shows up, -all right? -You still got my number, right? You sure you don't need this picture? I've seen it enough times already. All right. Hey, you know what? Uh, I think I got my eye on you. If you took off your sunglasses, maybe you would. [ Chuckles ] You want to go in the booth? Not really, unless you want to. No, not unless you want to. [ Both chuckle ] Happy Mother's Day. -What? -Today's Mother's Day. I thought maybe... you had a daughter or son. -I look that old? -I didn't mean it like that. It's okay. Actually, I have two sons. It's my youngest one Gilbert's birthday tomorrow. What about you? What did you get your mother? Well, I'm just gonna spend time with her. Aww, that's nice. I bet she'd really like that. See that guy over there? [ Chuckles ] He's been asking for a lap dance for about three weeks. So I got to go give him that and... We can hang out afterwards all night, if you like. Okay. Okay. Uh -- [ Both chuckle nervously ] [ Sighs ] Okay, I'll be back. [ Indistinct conversations ] -[ Panting ] -[ Speaking indistinctly ] -[ Grunting ] -[ Moaning ] -Yes, Adam! -Hey, Adam. You know, Adam, uh, you're getting out of shape. I'll charge you money for that. So, which one is she? Uh, that's her right there. Her name's Sirena. What I'd tell you? She says she used to live here. She just got back in town. Yeah. She's very sexy. So, I'm gonna need to see if you two have any chemistry. Hey, Tyan, why don't I, uh, bring her over to the booth? Yeah. There you go. [ Bottles clanking ] Show time. Tyan, this is Sirena. ** -Hello. -Hello. Adam, do you want to introduce me to your friend? Come here, come here. This is my friend. And this is not. You know who my friend is? Um... [ Chuckles ] he's, uh -- He's my favorite customer. He's my favorite actor. Are you in movies? Not anymore. I quit. You know that. I'm doing you a favor. -A favor? -Yeah. You act with beautiful girls to pay off a loan. Sirena, convince him to act. [ Chuckles ] Okay. Well, it's about time you get to see what you've been missing. So, what movies have you been in? Only bad ones. You can touch me. No touching allowed. [ Children shouting ] [ Claps hands ] -Sirena. -Yes? Take a break. Sure. I'm still not gonna act anymore. You hear me? You hear me, motherfucker? I'm gonna pay you the money that I owe you. Okay? How much is it now? $30,000. How you gonna come up with that money? You can't even read. I got a house. -I got furniture to sell. -Yeah. You owe me the money because you wanted the house. Well, nobody visits me. You would rather risk owing me that money than fucking Sirena? I'll let you fuck her as many times as you want. You don't pay me in seven days, you die. Count that on your fucking fingers. I guarantee you, I'll be alive in seven days. And when I bring you $35,000, you won't bring Sirena into the business. Sure. For $37,000. Well, I will see you, my friend, in seven days with $37,000. ** Can I have an application, please? -Thanks. -Hey, if you fill this out right now, you get an interview today. No, that's okay. I'll bring it in tomorrow. No, but the position might be filled by then. Uh, that's okay. I'll bring it in tomorrow. Thanks. -Hey, Cory. -Hey, Adam. -[ Chuckles ] -[ Groans ] I got you. -[ Chuckling ] -[ Groaning ] Just barely. Whatcha doing? Uh, my mama never picked me up from school. Devin told me to wait here when she doesn't come. I don't mind it. A lot of the kids here give me toys to play with. I don't have many toys at home. Well, when's Devin coming? Uh, I don't know. Here, you can call him. Ah. [ Laughs ] No. That don't work. -It doesn't work. -Mnh-mnh. Come on. I'm gonna take you home, okay? Oh, no. I don't know my way home. I know the way. -Will you read to me? -Oh, sure. Wow. It's a rat. Yeah, him. -[ Chuckling ] -It's a rat. Yeah. It's a rodent rat. -Rodent rat. Ah. -Yeah. [ Dog barking in distance ] "Rodent rat with a green hat." -[ Chuckles ] -That's him. [ Speaks indistinctly ] And then they -- -Scary. -Yeah, yeah. Looks mean. -Yeah, he looks mean, huh? -Mm-hmm. [ Stammering ] He's a monster. -He's a monster? -Yeah, he is. -Hey, guys. -Hey. Hi, brother. Adam reading to me. -I can see that, Cory. -Yeah. Hey, you should go to bed. No, Adam's gonna read to me. Cory, it's past your bedtime. All right. Bye, Adam. Night. Here you go. Come on. Sit down. I don't want to go to bed. Well, you got to go to bed, okay? Will you read to me? Cory, don't do this to me tonight, okay? How about my pajamas? [ Sighs ] You don't need to wear your pajamas tonight. -Why? -Just get into bed. Good night. [ Smooches ] Sleep tight. -Hey. -Hey. So, uh, Angeline didn't pick him up? Nope. Thanks. -Did you eat today? -[ Sighs ] Yeah. Um, can you help me fill this out? It's another application. What happened to the other one I did for you? Well, they don't match. I compared them, but -- So I guess this means you didn't show up for Tyan today. Uh, you'll find out tomorrow. Look, it's just different formats. Um, this one's two references. Give me that paper. I'll be one. And, uh, who do you want for the other one? That gay guy you always hanging out with? Why you got to add gay in the sentence? Why you always got to be talking him to school and picking him up afterwards? So he don't get beat up. Kind of like I did for you at the orphanage? Why don't you just -- Just put down Kobe. I heard Kobe broke up with her boyfriend. Yeah. Um, he cheated on her... just like you cheated on your girlfriend. Yeah, well, that's why I never went out with her. Well, Kobe deserves better than you. Yeah? You like her so much, then why aren't you with her? She deserves better than me. Why don't you make copies of both in case you lose them? Good night, Adam. Good night. [ Door shuts ] -Oh. -It's not like I've never seen your naked body before. You're always trying to show it off. [ Sighs ] Your body looks nice. 'Cause I've been working out. If I get aroused, I'm sorry. If I don't get aroused, I'm sorry. [ Clears throat ] Devin asked me out. He's a good guy. So are you. Why don't you ask me out? I'm an asshole. I'm doing you a favor. I'll ask you, then. Would you like to go out? Devin's my friend. You never treated him like a friend. Then I'm glad to know my plan's working. If you're gay, you can just tell me. You think that I am? You never deny it. Never admit it. You not aroused. [ Sighs ] -You spending the night? -Yeah. I ain't sleeping on the floor. I don't have anything to worry about. I'm not a guy. [ Chuckles ] Why don't we take the plastic off? It'll be more comfortable. Mm, I don't want to mess up the bed. My dad might be comin' over. Well, how am I supposed to get into the blankets? Hold on. Use this. How's that? There you go. Good night. Ouch. Is this real? Why else would I have it? You know I don't know when you're joking or when you're serious. I like that. Have you ever slept with a girl? I never actually got to sleep with one. Have you ever fallen in love with a girl? Yeah. What happened? I never told her. You should. She deserves better than me. Here. What? I'm not a stripper. You know, she doesn't just strip. She dances. Why don't you caller her a dancer? I'm not gonna give you a lap dance. [ Chuckles ] It's for the food you always buy. You know, maybe the dancer's my mother. Oh, everyone's part of your family. You ain't my sister. Well, if they're all part of your family, why aren't you with them? Ask my father. He's the one who left. I mean, I bought this house so he'd stay. cut furniture, help him get into character, be a real father, but... I just don't want to lose the rest of my family. Is that true? You know what's true? I'm tired. Mm. [ Yawns ] [ Panting ] [ Panting ] -[ Moans ] -[ Panting ] Adam? Mm. Are you awake? Is there anything between us? No. [ Birds chirping ] I'm gonna start seeing Devin. We can't go on like this. He's a good guy. So are you, Adam. [ Conversing indistinctly ] -Hey, Cory. -Yeah. Let's play that game where you close your eyes, and you try to find your room. Oh, okay. My memory -- Where is it? You won't get a chance to beat me. -Okay. -I'm gonna win. -Get in there, buddy. -Watch. -I'm watching. -I told you! I won! -You sure did! -Yeah. Hey, why don't you get ready for the park? Okay. Park. Why'd you have to bring that? Tyan: She's my wife. Keep a marriage happy, a husband's got to buy his wife gifts. Was your other wife this happy? I don't -- I don't want to -- I don't want to go to sleep. [ Babbling indistinctly ] -Shh. -[ Babbling ] [ Whimpering ] I got Cory a gift, too. So you're admitting that you're his father? Not if he's still retarded, I'm not. Let me see your fist. You're not bruised. You're not beating on Adam enough. Now they look like you've been beating on him. They don't bleed tomorrow, I'm gonna do it again. You got to get used to beating on your friend. You may have to kill him someday. Or in seven. [ Plates smash ] There's no way that I'm gonna kill Adam. -He's my friend. -Adam owes me $37,000. If he doesn't pay, then you'll have to kill him. You can't pay that in seven days. You won't have a friend, then. You wanted to come work for me. I put a roof over your head, clothes on your back, all right? The job you wanted was the responsibility of Adam. Yeah. To take care of him. -$28,000! -Look after him. All right. You pay me $28,000, your job's over. You won't have to kill your best friend. Okay, I'm ready for the sand, brother. Oh, hi, friend. My name is Cory. I live here. What's your name? Hey, Cory, hey. He's just a salesman, a salesman of Lincoln Logs. Oh. Did you buy them? I'd like to play with them. No, I didn't buy them. I'm gonna get you some better ones, okay? If you decide not to pay, then you'll kill Adam, all right? I'm being nice here. I'm giving you options. If you decide not to choose, then I'll kill you. Say bye to the salesman. Bye-bye. Can I have them? No, they're broken. Come on. Okay. [ Chuckles ] When are you going back to school? I'm taking you to school right now. You know what I mean. I told you. I work nights. I got to sleep during the day. What's up, homosexual? You can let Gilbert go, heterosexual. I'm you're problem. Are you sure about that? [ Trigger clicking ] Yeah, I'm sure. Don't get my hopes up if it ain't loaded. -Come on, dude. -That was amazing. [ Chuckles ] How'd you know that wasn't loaded? You know he's got bad luck. Amazing. That was... Wow. Hey, Adam, it's your dad. I thought I might come by and see you, you know, check out the new house. Maybe we'll go get some food. We'll hang out... Kobe: Have you ever fallen in love with a girl? Devin: If you like her so much, then why aren't you with her? Adam: She deserves better than me. Kobe: Would you like to go out? Kobe: Is there anything between us? Adam: No. ** So, I want to -- Well, I want to tell you something. Um... It's okay. It's really hard. * Well, she's deep crimson lips, like a secret eclipse * * And I'm all in blurs * * A slim summer dress and where we can distress * * Around this pearl * * And, oh, but these lashes left me to ashes * * And heavy life sleeping for days * * But we won't get no rest, obsessed by a quest * * I'm a homesick boy far, far away * * And rain and a nation gave * * A fall, and I can't be blamed * * She's a walk in Spain * * She's a walk in Spain * * Mm-mm-mm-hmm * * Uhh-huh * [ Birds chirping ] [ Telephone rings ] Hello, Da-- He is? I'll be right down. Thanks. -What's that? -Uh -- Adam. -Hmm? -There you go. Thanks. You right-handed or left-handed? Right. Did you eat today? Yeah. We'll, I'm flattered that you paid somebody to kick my ass. Yeah, well, I don't like hurting you, so... I'd rather be hurt by a friend than someone I don't know. Yeah, well, if you show up for work, nobody will have to hurt you. I don't want my heart broke no more, okay? Right. Now, um, can we do this tomorrow? 'Cause I got somewhere important to go. -It's gonna take a minute. -I don't got a minute. I can do it in 30 seconds. -30 seconds. -30 seconds. You're that good, huh? We'll find out. I kind of want to stay around for this, but, uh, I'm just gonna have to hurry back. Uh, since your friend, here, Brutus, is, uh -- -It's Sergio. -Oh, sorry. Since he's kicking my ass, you can wait inside. -You can wait outside. -No, we're gonna go with you. ** * It'll take your whole world * * Break it apart * Thank you for calling me. I really appreciate it. Where is he? * Leave you no choice * * But to make a new start * * Not really knowing * * What the future will bring * * A broken heart * * Is a beautiful thing * * It'll take your false hopes * * Shoot 'em on down * * Get you so low * * Put your feet on the ground * * Make a strong man weep * * Make a blues man sing * * A broken heart * * Is a beautiful thing * * A broken heart * * Is a beautiful thing * * It's an awful blow * * Make you wonder what you're living for * * But all the suffering you go through * * Only goes to show what love can do * * A broken heart * * Is a beautiful thing * * A broken heart * * Is a beautiful thing * -Where do you want him? -On the bed. I got to piss. Where's your bathroom? -Are you still kicking my ass? -Yeah. Then you still ain't allowed in my house. You can piss outside, all right? See you later. -Right here? -Yeah. I'm gonna change these clothes. I don't want to get them dirty. [ Grunts, sighs ] [ Urinating ] Oh, little flower. -Getting all excited? -Not really. Let's go. All right, let's do it here. All right, so, why don't you give me a practice hit so I can get used to you? -Okay, I'm gonna hit you. -Uh-huh. You're gonna fall down. Oh. But then I don't recall this. [ Gunshot ] Relax. It's just a BB Gun. What are you doing carrying this around, man? Somebody's gonna think it's real. They're gonna shoot you. It's all part of a backup plan. -Asshole. -Let's time this, see if it takes 30 seconds for me to go down. Look. You don't hit him in the face. You don't hit him between the legs. He needs to look good for work, and he needs to perform well for work. -Okay? -Yeah, just don't talk to me. You're ruining my concentration. You ready? All right. [ Both grunting ] Will you quit showing off? Just go down. Oh, I almost forgot. [ Chuckles ] Was I supposed to fall down sooner? What do you got to give him a cheap shot for, man? -He's going down. -Hey, he was making fun of me. Devin: You all right? Haven't gotten up, have I? Take some deep breaths. Let me see. Ooh. Put some ice on there. You'll be all right tomorrow. Ah, what a great friend I got, huh? I am. You're still alive because of me. Well, then, I guess I owe you a favor. -Let's go. -You didn't have to hit me. [ Doorbell ringing ] Kobe: He okay? Yeah, he's just nervous about seeing me. You don't look okay. -You look tired. -[ Sighs ] So, you're really my daddy? We got the same last name, don't we? Yeah. You can call me, like, uh, Dad or Warrick. Cool? Okay, Dad. ...disappoint you no more, so, uh... Yeah, I think -- Yeah, you're better off without me in your life anyway. Dad? So, uh...bye. [ Dial tone ] [ Click, beep ] [ Tape rewinding ] Warrick: Hey, uh, Adam, it's, uh -- It's me, you know? Hey, I just -- I really love the house, man. You did a great job. It looks -- looks great. I, uh -- [ Clears throat ] Sorry about leaving. You know, I was gonna wake you up, but then I was afraid, you know, we wouldn't have nothing to talk about, so... I just don't want to disappoint you no more, so, uh -- Yeah, I think -- Yeah, you're better off without me in your life anyway. So, uh...bye. [ Click ] [ Knock on door ] Yeah? Oh, you're awake. I was gonna surprise and fill your refrigerator full of food. Well, I'm about to get my dad up. We got a lot to talk about. Oh, your dad's still sleeping? Yeah. Um, well, I'll just let you two alone. Thanks. Hey, guys that hold hands are faggots. I'm not a faggot. Are you a fag? No. So, you're really my daddy? Got the same last name, don't we? Got the same last name, -don't we? -Yeah. You know, really, a kid your age shouldn't be calling me Daddy. When I was your age, I called my old man Daddy, and the other kids thought I was a baby for talking that shit. They liked to kick my ass. [ Distorted ] So you can call me, like, uh, Dad or Warrick. -Dad or Warrick. -Okay, Dad. Listen, uh... Listen, uh... Why don't you do me a favor? Want you to, uh, stay right here for just a few minutes, okay? I'm gonna go in here for just a moment. You stay right here. Now, don't go anywhere, okay? -Stay right here. -Okay. Be right back. [ Wind howling ] Angeline... The house needs to be clean. Social Services is coming tonight. They're gonna take Cory away if they see this. Do you hear me? Jesus. Get up. [ Grunting ] Stand up. [ Laughing ] Brother, brother... [ Speaks indistinctly ] The monsters were about to get me. And I told them you were coming home, but they didn't believe me. They're gonna be sorry, right? Sure are, buddy. -Okay? -All right. I'm gonna go take care of them. All right. Be careful, brother. -I will. -Bye-bye. Okay, Cory, I'm hunting the monsters. Rowr. Rowr. Okay, they're all gone. Are you sure? Yeah. I think they're all gone. Yeah, they sure are. [ Chuckles ] -Go to bed, okay, buddy? -All right. Hi, brother. Hey, what's going on? Mom has to read me a story, but she keeps forgetting. All right. Come here. Sit down. [ Sighs ] So, what do you got here? Rodent Rat. Will you read to me? Yeah. Here, give me the chain. All right, get comfortable, Cory. Okay. Rodent Rat. [ Sighs ] Part One. ** [ Buzzer ] Hi, Ms. Walker. -Hi, Devin. -Come in. You look great. Yeah. Your mother around? Oh, no. She just started a new job tonight. Mm-hmm. So... Where's Cory? Oh, uh, he's sleeping. I'll show you. Sorry. Uh, just right back there. Mom fed him real good before she left, knocked him right out. Walker: And what was for dinner? Oh, uh... good, old spaghetti. Mm-hmm. You look filthy. Oh, yeah. Cory and I were playing out in the backyard, and, I mean, I haven't even had a chance to take a shower yet. Mm-hmm. You make sure Angeline is here when I stop by next week. Yeah. Sure thing, Ms. Walker. Okay. [ Smacks lips ] See ya. [ Sighs ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots ] [ Knocking on door ] [ Grunting ] [ Chuckling ] You don't have to do pushups for me. [ Panting ] So, uh... you and Devin break up? No. Then why are you here? What? [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] Uh, you look different... like, older. And you smell different. I know what it is. You're like everybody else now. You had sex with Devin, right? Yes. Was it in a bed? It was. Did he wear a condom? Yes. Was he gentle? Oh, very. [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] I don't want to hear any more. You hungry? Well, let's go celebrate. [ Sighs ] [ Grunting ] [ Birds chirping ] Hi, brother! [ Chuckles ] Hey. -Shh! Mom is sleeping, okay? -Oh, yeah. I think it's almost Easter, brother. The neighbors have been putting out the Easter eggs. Uh, yeah. Easter's tomorrow. Yeah. I haven't even colored any eggs. Is the Easter Bunny gonna hide them this year? How about I hide them? Would you like to celebrate Easter right now? Boy, would I ever! [ Chuckles ] Yeah! All right. You've been a great guy. Why don't you, uh, go into your room and get ready -while I use the phone, okay? -All right. [ Dialing ] Uh, hi. Um, I-I think my foster mother died of an overdose. Um, okay. Uh, I'll leave the door open. Okay. -Okay, I'm ready! -Okay, let's go. [ Laughing ] Bye-bye, Mom. Devin's gonna take me Easter-egg hunting. Cory! We don't want to wake her, okay? Oh, all right. Shh. We should be quiet. Bye, Mom. Let's go. Leave it open, okay? -Mama's sleepin'. -It's okay. Easter. Come on. This isn't the way to the park. Yeah, I know. We're not gonna go to the park. We're gonna do it right here, okay? Why don't you go wait over by the wall? All right. Just wait right there. -[ Chuckling ] -Ready? -Yeah. -Why don't you close your eyes? [ Chuckling ] Okay. [ Laughs ] I'm really excited! I never done this before. You ready? -Okay. Ready? -Yeah. -Okay. -[ Chuckles ] Yeah. Why do they hide the eggs for the Easter Bunny, brother? I don't know, Cory. Why don't I get the chocolate Easter bunny? All my friends do. Yeah, I'll make sure the Easter Bunny gets you -a nice chocolate bunny. -Yeah. I like that. I found one! [ Laughs ] Found one. -I'm good at this, right? -Really good. Yeah. Would I be able to meet the Easter Bunny tonight? Well, he won't come if you're awake. -He won't? -No. All right. I'm gonna try real hard to sleep, then, okay? Will you make sure I'm asleep, brother? [ Both speak indistinctly ] [ Egg cracks ] Oh. I broke one. [ Sirens wailing ] [ Chuckles ] -I love you. -I love you, too. Cory, why don't you go in your room, go hide these eggs? I'll -- I'll come and find them. -All right. -Go. Can I have him for tonight? You can pick him up in the morning. Make sure he gets these in the morning. Come on. Turn around. What did I do? I don't know yet. Why'd you leave with Cory? I knew it'd be my last night with him. Listen. Can we just take these off so I can give him a hug when he leaves? I think we should play it safe. Keep them on. Why? What am I gonna do? I don't know, but I'm not gonna take any more chances. [ Chuckling ] Hey, brother. Ms. Lucy said I'm gonna go meet new friends. Oh, that's great. Why you got your hands behind your back? My hands are real cold, so I'm keeping them in my pockets back here. Why don't you keep them in your front pockets? Oh, that's a good idea. You always were smarter than me, brother. [ Laughing ] That's because I'm your older brother. Happy Easter, brother. Happy Easter, brother. Come on. Let's go. What about him? He'll be okay. We're gonna go meet that nice, new family. I want my brother. [ Chuckles ] [ Laughs ] Hi, brother. Wait, no. No. No! [ Chuckles nervously ] You moving? No. Why you think that? Well, there's a sign posted in your yard. Don't believe everything you read. All right, well, you should move. You know, we could actually be like a year or two older than we really are. Or younger. I keep thinking I've got this mom out there... who thinks about me, comin' back to get me. If she didn't want me... I'd just like to ask her when I was born. I wouldn't bother her any more. Look, I don't want to know this. I mean, you opened up to the wrong person. You got Kobe as a girlfriend now. Tell her. Here. It's your chance to get out of here. You got nothing keeping you here. You don't know what I got. Fine. You want to stay? Then why don't you go back and work for Tyan? It's the easiest job in the world. What do you do, you fuck chicks who look like models? What's so hard about that? Don't ever make Kobe feel that way. I won't. I love her. Good answer. Thanks, um, for, uh, you know, having faith in me to pay the money back. You don't have that kind of money, Adam. Well, then, you're gonna have to start hating me pretty quick. Right. Except I can't. We grew up together. I'm all grown up now. You are the only family that I got. I do not want to lose you, Adam. You got Cory. Angeline's dead. They took Cory away. I'm sorry. Come here. [ Inhales deeply ] [ Children talking, yelling ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Sighs ] I didn't realize I was so close. Don't worry about it. Everybody gets cold. Feeling better? Yeah. Well, then, I guess I can be an asshole again. Hey. I paid $100 for this. So now I owe $37,100. He's gonna kill me if I don't kill you. Great. Look at the mess you got yourself into. Yeah, well, you know, I had to look after you somehow. I'll pay back the money, I promise. -How can you be sure? -Because I said I promise. Just pay it, Adam. [ Knocking on door ] Coming! -Mom. -What? -Are you gonna answer it? -Yes. Hello? Devin: Yeah. Uh, Devin? Y-- uh, yeah. What, were you expecting me? No. Never. [ Laughs nervously ] Why don't you, um, come in? Come in. Okay. [ Exhales sharply ] -Hey. -This -- This is Gilbert. -Hi. -Hi. -How's it going? -Good. -Uh -- -Are you going somewhere, honey? -Yeah. I'm late. I got to go. -No, stick around. Why don't -- No, Mom, seriously. I really need to go. -Okay. -I'll see you later. -Okay. -Bye. Uh, nice meeting you. Yeah. All right. -[ Laughs nervously ] -Hey. Hi. Okay. [ Sighs ] Oh. So, um [Laughs nervously] h-how did you find me? Oh, uh... I went down to the club. Antonio told me where you lived. Um... are you in love with Adam? [ Chuckles ] Never thought about it. [ Breathes deeply ] I guess that means no. Well, could you be? No. Is that why you came here? Yes. Look, I need to know how you feel about Adam. He's a friend. No, he's not! He's not gonna be anybody's friend! Adam's in trouble. What about you? Are you in trouble? Yeah. I'm not gonna be anybody's friend, either. [ Sighs ] What do I have to do? You know what Adam does? Yeah, he's in movies. Adult movies. I want you... to sleep with Adam. You'll get paid 1,000 bucks a scene. I'll make sure it's the safest situation possible. [ Breathes deeply ] What about you? Are you gonna be there? No, that's not my thing. I'll do it. Yeah? Yeah. -Thanks. -[ Voice breaking ] Thanks. Okay, bye. -All right. -Yeah. -Thanks. -Okay. [ Door shuts ] [ Sobs ] Warrick: Hey, Adam, it's your dad. I was just calling to, you know, see how things were going. I mean, um, I was thinking about maybe visiting you or something. You know, it's been a while. Think of it as doing something for your son. I thought you were supposed to be asleep. Who's that, Dad? Um, uh...that's your mom. [ Camera shutter clicks, printer whirs ] Are you coming? -Yeah. -Good. Why are you taking me over here? Because... I found who I was looking for. Why are you taking your top off? Because...you have to get used to my naked body. We're gonna do a scene together. We already been seen together. No, for the movies. Look, I don't got no money for you tonight. I think you should put your top back on. Please. How much? How much did he give you? Who? Devin. For what? For giving me money. He turned out to be more than I expected. His mom would be proud. I am. You're his mom? You can stop. Stop pretending. Okay. Now I know why you didn't want to give me a lap dance. You were watching over me for Devin. -[ Sniffles ] -Somethin' like that. I figured that's what he'd do for me. When were you gonna tell him? Soon. How did you know? Doesn't matter. I just did. I ain't doing a scene with you. You don't know nothing about me. You don't even know my last name. I know everything. I know everything I need to know about you. I know that your name is Adam Blande. I know that your address is 1125 Webster Street. I know that you're Devin's friend. I know that you got him into trouble. I ain't gonna put you in trouble. [ Crying ] Oh. Adam, fuck me, please. Please. I can't. -I can't. -Oh, yes, you can. This looks like me when I was younger. It's not. How would I have a picture of you in my wallet? Adam, Tyan is expecting your answer tomorrow. I'll give you my answer tomorrow, too, okay? When's Devin's birthday? April 1st. April Fool's Day. 1977. [ Sobbing ] Adam, please don't go. No, no. Please don't go. Please don't go. Please don't go. No. [ Indistinct conversations ] We had a deal. Hey. She came to me, okay? I'm not gonna turn down a franchise. -Hi, Adam. -She just saved your life. I told you, I'm not doing nothing with her. Well, then, you owe me $37,000. My apologies -- $35,000, since she's working for me now. -Ooh, come on. -You know, actually, right now, I owe you $34,999. That all you got? I got one more day. Excuse me. [ Gunshots ] [ Sighs ] Man: Yeah, I know I told you that. Yeah, I know. I realize that. I probably think I made some kind of a record. [ Chuckles ] You can thank me later, all right? We'll do Italian. [ Chuckles ] Sorry. Adam, got your check for you. $37,600. Already took out my 6%. [ Clears throat ] -Good. -Yeah. They're comin' by around 6:00 and 7:00 to change the locks. That'll -- That'll give you enough time -to get your stuff out, right? -Yeah. Great, great. Well, good doing business with you, man. -Yeah. -All right. Hey -- Oh, hey. Hey, there you go. Pass these out to your friends, will you? It's important, you know, for my biz. -You take care, all right? -You, too. Let's do lunch sometime, okay? Okay. [ Door shuts ] [ Sighs deeply ] [ Clears throat ] [ Dog barking ] Your old plane ticket. You sold your house? Got the money? Yeah, be all settled tomorrow. Where you moving? Up north, I think. -Yeah? -Yeah. Oh, hey. Open it. Oh, wow. What do you think? Well, Devin, I'm flattered, but I can't marry you. [ Chuckles ] I'm gonna ask Kobe to marry me. Wow. -Sorry. -Don't drop it, man. Sorry. I'm gonna propose to her tonight. Just, you know, don't do it on the phone. [ Chuckles ] No. I'm gonna go over when she's sleeping and slip it on her finger. When she wakes up... ask her to marry me. Wow. [ Chuckles ] Uh, what time you gonna go over? Like 11:00. That's when she goes to sleep. Wow. Good luck, you know? Yeah. Just, you know, don't get to excited. We got to make sure, you know, you eat. Get somethin' in that stomach. [ Laughing ] Yeah. Come here. All right, man. [ Clears throat ] See you later, huh? Kobe: Is this real? Devin: It's just a BB gun. Adam: Why else would I have it? Hey. -I'm not getting beat up today. -I've been practicing. I know I can get you down in 30 seconds this time. Well, I'll have to pay you to beat somebody else up. -Uh... -3:00. I...got an appointment at 3:00 to break this guy's finger. I'm gettin' 50 bucks, -and my guy, he's -- -100 bucks. -100 bucks. -Oh, 100 bucks. 3:00. All right? Come on. I think I could -- Yeah, bring it on! Excuse me. I got a message from Adam. Yeah? [ Both grunt ] Sorry. Okay, uh, j-just one more. I-I'm sorry. All right. So, uh, I'm gonna give you $500 if you're here at 3:00 for the next five days. What do I got to do? Just make sure Ron doesn't beat up Gilbert. All right. Um, open up that calendar thing. I want you to say this to Gilbert. Wow. It's, like, the best job I had in my life. [ Chuckles ] -Okay. -Okay. Okay. Shoot. -All right. "Adam moved." -"Adam moved. If he don't keep in touch, don't take it personal. You have nothing to worry about. Adam." I guess I'm gonna be walking you home for a little while. No. It's okay. -Yeah? -Yeah. I think I can handle it on my own. Thank you. Yeah. [ Sighs ] You remember that girl I told you I was in love with? Yeah. What was her name again? I never told you her name. I don't want to make her hate me. Why? I'm moving. It'll be easier for her. She won't be sad when I'm gone. Well, maybe she'd want to go with you. No. She needs to live her life here. When are you moving? Tomorrow. Well, we don't have much time. How do you want to do this? I made it easy for us. I told her to come over around 11:00, just to come in, not even knock. We'll be in bed. I'll go change. What's that? Uh, you said you want to see me on videotape. I'm gonna show it to you later. Is the girl on the tape the one who's coming over? No. But you'll meet her soon. Right. [ Sighs ] I mean, you're a pro now. I don't got to tell you what to do. I don't pull hair. With me, you would. It would be so intense, you'd need to hold on just to keep up with me. Your hands would be sliding all over my skin from all the sweat. The bed would be moving too fast to even get a grip. The sheets would be shredded from your nails. You'd have no choice. You're making me want Devin here. I'm gonna close my eyes. Okay. Just make sure you say my name and not Devin's. No kissing. I never tried before. Because I'm not a guy? Kobe: Yes. Yes. [ Chuckling ] Oh, yes, Adam. [ Moaning ] Yes, Adam. [ Moans ] [ Strained ] I need a couple more seconds. Oh. It's not what you think, Devin. No. It's not like we're in love or anything. It's not what you think, Devin! No, it isn't -- -[ Grunting ] -No, Devin! [ Crying ] Please! It's not what you think! We were just pretending! You have to believe me! Why don't you save it for tomorrow? But Devin -- [ Door slams ] [ Moaning ] [ Sobbing ] You're an asshole. Yeah, I told you I was. [ Moaning continues ] Yeah, you see that? I could never do that with you. You're too ugly. If I kissed you, I'd throw up. [ Sobbing ] Get out! Oh, Adam. I'm glad you're leaving. I wish you were dead. Yeah, well your wish will come true. [ Sobbing ] Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! [ Sobbing ] [ Moaning continues ] Oh, Adam. [ Sobbing ] Warrick: Hey, Adam, it's your dad. I was just calling to, you know, see how things were going. I was thinking about maybe visiting you or something. You know, it's been a while. You should be wearing your sunglasses, Antonio. It's a beautiful day out. Oh, no. I want to see this. Do you have the money? That's a tough question. I'm gonna have to say no. Devin, do you? If I'm gonna get shot, I don't want to get hurt more by falling on this. Tyan: Adam, put the BB gun away. I'm doing this for you, Devin. Devin: It's your chance to get out of here. You got nothing keeping you here. Kobe: Is there anything between us? I got this mom out there somewhere. Warrick: You're better off without me in your life anyway. Adam: I figured that's what he'd do for me. [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshot ] I'm gonna make this quick. I got to get back to Kobe. [ Coughing ] I told you I'd make it easier for you. Kobe was right. We were just pretending. She loves you. She loves you. My plan worked. [ Wheezing ] You arm will be cool. Doctors can fix it right up. [ Coughs ] I got the money, too. [ Coughing ] Why didn't you give it to them? It's your money. You got a mom and a brother to look after. What are you talkin' about, I got a mom and a brother? [ Wheezes ] It hurts for me to talk. Sirena will tell you. Oh. I'm getting cold. My dad never told me when my birthday was. [ Coughs ] It's always the first day we met in the orphanage. [ Sirens wailing ] -Get out of here. -No. I'm not gonna leave you. [ Wheezing ] You're my family, Devin. [ Sirens wailing ] [ Coughing ] Warrick: Hey, uh, Adam, it's, uh -- It's me, you know? Hey, I just -- I really love the house, man. You did a great job. It looks -- looks great. I, uh -- [ Clears throat ] Sorry about leaving. You know, I was gonna wake you up, but then I was afraid, you know, we wouldn't have nothing to talk about, so... I just don't want to disappoint you no more, so, uh -- Yeah, I think -- Yeah, you're better off without me in your life anyway. So, uh...bye.
