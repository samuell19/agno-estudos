TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY Li! -Good morning. -Morning. -Have a bite. -I'm not hungry. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. - Okay. - Come on. It's too early for you two to act so lovey-dovey. Jun! At least you remembered this time. It's not funny! I just forgot about it. - Ah, this trick again? - Go! - You guys are too slow! - We'll see. - Go! Go! - We're winning! Come on! Go! -Hi. -Hi. -It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Davis. -You can call me Daniel. Are you the assistant they hired? -Yes, and I'm so grateful... -Great. ...to have the chance to work with you. -Yeah. -I've read so much of your work. It's really remarkable. The coverage of '89 in particular. Uh, no, I don't do that sort of thing anymore. Well, the writing was excellent. I can't tell you how much I've learned from you already. -Where'd you park? -Reading your student interviews -in particular was so educational-- -What'd you say your name was again? -Min. -Min. So nice to meet you. We'll have plenty of time to talk about writing later. But I want to get the hell out of this airport. I've been on a plane for 16 hours. -Of course, of course, this way. -Yeah. Okay. Jun, why haven't you left yet? You look so pretty today. I wanted to keep watching. So sweet all of a sudden. I can't believe you get up early every day for this. What's the point? It's good for the mind and body. Let me show you. Falun Gong has five sets of exercises. It takes two hours to do them. That's it? Well, the movements are easy to learn. But the key is to follow the principles of Truth, Compassion, and Tolerance. That's not so easy. You think you can handle it? -Of course. -Give it a try? -Okay. -Let's get started. FALUN GONG FREE TEACHING What do you think of this? Falun Gong? It's certainly popular. It seems like everyone is a practitioner these days. 100 million. Wow. They have more members than the Party! Do something. Secretary Yang has an important meeting to get to. Yes, sir. You! Move up. Get out of here. Keep moving. Are you trying to electrocute me? Wait. The results from the beta test are back. I don't think our system can produce these results. Everybody tweaks their data. No one will be able to tell. But we are lying. If we submit the real results, we won't get the grant. Now that you're practicing, you have to be honest. All right. Oh, yes! -I can't eat anything anymore, Mr. Gao! -Yes. You're going to feed me to death! Come on, no, we're just getting started. I've got ten years to make up for. I knew I missed this man for a reason. I'm just curious. Why did you take this job? I think it was your coverage of June 4th. Oh. You stood up for something and you took a risk to give a voice to those students. The student I interviewed was killed. Did you know that? I suppose I assumed. I'm sure to you, right now, journalism feels like the most urgent work a person can do. But the world forgets. And forgets quickly. Our lab was denied the grant. Something wrong with the data, I heard. You know I am a Falun Gong practitioner. I can't abandon truth just for convenience. I have heard rumors. The higher-ups may take action against Falun Gong. You have to be careful. That's impossible. The government has been very supportive. Many Party members practice. That's exactly the issue. Falun Gong teaches us to be a good person. The more people who practice, the better, right? Maybe I overreacted. All right, I'll let you go. Okay. It's clearly getting out of control. Secretary Yang, the Party is counting on you. I pulled an all-nighter. What's going on? What happened? You're so late today. Dozens of practitioners were arrested and beaten in Tianjin. What? This has to be a misunderstanding. The Tianjin government told the practitioners to come to Beijing. Why come to Beijing? We should go to the Appeals Office and file an appeal. Yes, yes, let's go! I don't think it's that simple. My father's unit participated in the crackdown in '89. He warned me to stay away from this sort of thing. We're good people. What do we have to worry about? We want to report the situation to the Appeals Office. -Anybody want to go? -Sure, yes. Okay. Let's go. There are so many people. Let's go to the gate. This is unbelievable. This has got to be the largest demonstration since '89. So quiet. Hey! Come with me. Wait, wait, no. I'm allowed to be here. Sir, I have a press pass. A press pass. -Doesn't matter, come with me now. -You can't do that. I have credentials to be here. -Hello, everyone. -Hello. I am from the Appeals Office. We would like to speak to your organizers. We have no organizers. We've all come voluntarily. Some of you must volunteer. We cannot speak with all of you. I will go. And I. -I will go too. -I will go too. I will go too. Fine. You five, come with me. Excuse me. Thank you. Please have a seat. We're here to find out about the arrest in Tianjin. We're looking into this incident. There might be some misunderstanding... It's good to see you again, Daniel. I wasn't sure you'd be back. Neither was I. You've been away for a long time, Daniel. Many things have changed. Perhaps you have changed, too? Being hauled into a van in the middle of the night and driven to the airport with no warning will alter a person's worldview. But that's in the past. I came back to work on a book about traditional Chinese culture. Our expectations are clear. You're a guest here. China is home to me. All the more reason to highlight its triumphs. I don't see why that would be an issue. Good to have you back. Thank you! Thank you for coming. Please tell everyone to go home. Of course. That's great! The officials have confirmed that the government has never banned any kind of qigong. And they have assured us the practitioners will be released. We can go home now. Great! All resolved. Let's go. On April 25, 1999 over ten thousand Falun Gong members besieged the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party. It was a vicious attack against the Party. They severely interfered with government operations and gravely disrupted social order. This is the most serious political incident since the 1989 riots in Tiananmen Square... What's going on? It was a trap. The government declares Falun Dafa Association and Falun Gong illegal. Wang. They are officially banned. CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE DIRECTIVE Get in the car! Move it! Hurry up. - Incredible, isn't it? - It is... You seem unsure. Of course, I support the Party. I just wonder if Falun Gong is threatening enough to warrant all of this. If Falun Gong wins the people's hearts, who will be left to follow the Party? Of course, of course. Opportunities like this don't come around often. It's up to you to make the most of it. What's wrong? Jun? Jun? Wang. Come in. Wang, I know you're under a lot of pressure. You are a bright star at Tsinghua. I won't make it difficult for you. Just sign this. Nobody needs to know. All of the trouble will be behind you. The Ministry of Education has issued a directive. Anyone who refuses to denounce Falun Gong will be expelled. You are about to complete your PhD. This is your life. Think about it carefully. Everything here... It's all a lie. "Anti-science, anti-human, and anti-society..." "I denounce and condemn Falun Gong." How can I possibly sign this? The Party has determined the nature of Falun Gong. As a student Party leader, you of all people should follow the Party. Secretary, will you tell the truth? The practitioners in our school, does anyone fit the portrayal in the media? You are a Party member and so am I. I dare to speak the truth. But you don't! Wang, who do you think you are talking to? Secretary Wu, could we have a moment alone? Wang... ...you are the age my son was when he was killed. He was exactly like you. Smart and stubborn. I... I regret every day. He was pushing his bike out the door. I should have tried harder to stop him. Even if I had to break his legs and take care of him for the rest of his life. So he was killed... -...during the riot--? -Riot? It was a peaceful appeal made by students. They labeled it a riot and launched a massacre. Now the Party is using the same tactic against Falun Gong. I... I don't want to lose another son. It's just a formality. Nobody knows what you really believe. I would know! You can lie to others, but you can't lie to yourself. Bro, you really want to give up your future? If we aren't free to say what we want, to be who we are, what is anything worth? You're so idealistic! Even if you sacrifice everything, you are just one person. What can you change, alone? At least I can remain unchanged. In the late '90s, Chinese government surveys said up to 100 million people were practicing Falun Gong daily. Health bills were decreasing, crime rates were falling, and morality was rising. After 50 years of political campaigns to destroy traditional beliefs... ...any revival of spirituality was seen as a threat to communist rule. Falun Gong stood in stark contrast with communist ideology. Do you still practice Falun Gong? Yes. So it would be very hard for it to be tolerated by the CCP. It is literally life and death for many of the upper echelon of the party members that run China to not let the Falun Gong stories be told. Falun Gong has been exemplary in its response. It has never dealt with violence in a violent way. It's always responded with forbearance, with love with truth, with patience. And ultimately, that's going to prevail. This is it then. Please, be careful. You don't always have to be on the front lines. It doesn't have to be your battle. And, don't be forgetful. Got it. Take care of yourself. Xia. I hope neither of us regrets this. A man viciously murdered his parents in Renqiu, Hebei Province. The murderer turns out to be a Falun Gong member, Fu Changjiu. Why did you kill your parents? When a person lives, he suffers. As soon as he dies, there is nothing, which is a blessing. If I don't kill them, they suffer. Where did you learn this? Falun Gong. I learned from Falun Gong. We offered to reduce his sentence from the death penalty to fifteen years. He was willing to say anything. Good work. Your father has arranged for your transfer to Fudan University. I don't want to go back to Shanghai. It's too dangerous here. This is where my life is. What about my friends? What about Wang-- That's enough! We are not negotiating. If you do not come back to Shanghai, I will cut you off. I will no longer pay your rent, or your tuition. It's up to you. The number you dialled cannot be connected, please call again later. We don't welcome Falun Gong here. Three, two, one. Congratulations! -Thank you. -Thank you. I can't believe you two just got married. Of course. She fell right into my trap! What? Wait. Xia. Don't overthink it. I think Jun's just busy. Why mention him? I'm fine. Look what I brought you. I wish you a long life of happiness together. May your babies come early! Thank you. This is... You actually meant the part about the babies. You're the boss, we will do as you say. Wait Yes? How dare they? FALUN GONG PRACTITIONER FU CHANGJIU KILLS PARENTS And people will believe it. This is terrible. The suppression is only going to get worse. We have to make sure people know the truth. RESTORE THE REPUTATION OF FALUN GONG FALUN DAFA IS GOOD Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey, hey, hey, stop! No photo. I'm a reporter with Chicago Post. Chicago Post. -No photo! -No photo. No photo. No photo. Stop! Stop! Let go of me! Who organized this protest? Please don't do this. Please don't. Please... Please don't... Please stop. I will tell you everything. It's Wang Boyu and Li Yueyao. Pay the balance quickly, or move out. Got it. Thank you. Have some water. Thank you. I can't imagine what Xia is going through right now. -Patrick Lane. -Hey, Patrick. Daniel. Secure line? That doesn't sound good. We're good on my end. So, what have you got for me? I think we need to reconsider how we cover this Falun Gong. I-- Before you waste your time trying to pitch it, people upstairs aren't going to be too happy if -if you go rogue on us. -Yeah, I know. But, Patrick, why did you get into this business in the first place? -Okay? I don't think it was to appease-- -You begged me to get you back there. Whatever it took. -Yeah, I know, I, I get that, but-- -Do you get it? Because I feel like I'm having to remind you that you spent the last ten years trying to claw your way back into the goddam country -and now it's like-- -Yeah, yeah. I got it. I said I got it. I got it. -Okay. -So. The regular beat. How about a piece on China's efforts to join the WTO? Okay, talk soon. Go fuck yourself. This banner incident has tarnished the reputation of Tsinghua University like nothing before. We have been asked to carefully review and reveal anyone linked to these criminals. Jun, please come to the front. These people are your friends. I want you to discuss how they abandoned their studies after they joined Falun Gong. Wang was a team leader in our laboratory. He was always ready to help others. He studied hard to achieve high grades. Since his obsession with Falun Gong began, he was only interested in "seeking perfection" and achieving a "higher level," which affected his work, and lead to the detriment of the entire lab. When the Party wisely decided to ban Falun Gong, Wang refused to repent. He lost everything. Including his status at a school that most are lucky to attend. He was led astray from his normal life, step by step, into the mind control of Falun Gong. Let me elaborate further. Wang not only ruined his own future, he also abetted Li and Xia in disrupting social order. Now Xia has been arrested. Xia was arrested? Wang and Li will soon be brought to justice as well. It is heartbreaking. Jun, tell us how she used your relationship to tempt you to join Falun Gong. She's not like that. -What did you say? -She's not like that. This university has given you the opportunity to redeem yourself. Do you still protect Falun Gong members? You must denounce her and expose her crimes, or you are the same as her. Secretary, Xia is nothing like what you said. Jun! It's a replica. But it's gorgeous. It's beautiful. This is really stunning. I love it. - You're not gonna buy it? - No. If I bought every beautiful piece I saw I'd be crushed to death by antiques. Hey, listen, um, I want to show you this gallery. It's right around the corner, okay? Before it closes. There's a piece there... -Thank you, okay, bye-bye, bye. -Thank you, bye-bye. No peeking. Okay. Be careful. -Are you ready? -Yes. How did you afford all of this? I got a job! I told you, you don't need to worry. It's not safe over the phone. Let's talk when we meet. Okay. We looked everywhere for Xia. The police, detention centers... All the places I could think of. As soon as they heard Falun Gong, they either hung up immediately or repeated the propaganda. I want to hang banners with you. It's too risky now. What can we do, then? We can't just sit by and watch everyone be lied to. What about flyers? We could hand deliver them and reach more people. Li? Li? Are you all right? Are you all right? I'm fine. Breathe... Wait. Thank you. Who are you? What are you doing? Is your refrigerator broken? No. This is Unit 301, #18? This is #16. #18 is over there. Sorry. Wrong place, then. Falun Gong! This man is Falun Gong! This man is Falun Gong! Hello, I need four boxes of paper. You've got a cruel boss for sending a woman in your condition on an errand like this. It's okay. I have nothing to do at home anyway. How should I write the invoice for your company? I don't need one. I'll be paying cash. Of course. Can you wait here? I'll get what you need from the warehouse. Thank you. NOTICE OF ASSISTED INVESTIGATION Backdoor! -Hospital. Hurry up! -No problem! Get to your mailbox? No, no. I forgot something. Wang! Dad! Where have you been? I was... -I'm so sorry-- -You put your pregnant wife in danger. I entrusted my daughter to you. You cannot treat her like this. I had to pull some strings just to get her into this hospital safely. Hoping the police won't show up. I'm so, so sorry I was late. Mom, can you hold her? Li, I'm so sorry. Why didn't you pick up the phone? I'm so sorry. I thought something happened to you. I know. I'm very sorry. Let's not do something like this again. Okay? I know. Min! Hank, Susan, this is Min. Best assistant I've ever had. -Oh, this is for me? -Yes, but you should open it later-- No, no, no. -Open this now. -Okay. What could this be? Oh, my god! You went back for this? Min! -Happy birthday! -This is so thoughtful. I, I... Well, you did just say I'm the best assistant you've ever had-- Forget about me being your boss, I mean, this is... This is the nicest gift I've received in a long time. Come here. Come here. Hey guys, Min is a, an emerging journalist. -Hank and Susan work for CNN. -Hi. -Hi, Min. -Very good to meet you. Wang. Wind speed is 7 km/h at 258 degrees. Speed at 7. 258. 38! Fly high! What's that? Look at this. Look at this. "Fu Changjiu has never had any affiliation with Falun Gong. Furthermore, our practice vehemently prohibits killing of any kind." I told you this was all propaganda! Of course they would deny his involvement. Who wants to be associated with murder? Nobody risks their lives to lie. We've got to talk to this guy. What are you gonna do? Walk into the prison and demand to see him? No. I'm not. THE WHOLE NATION IS AGAINST HERETICAL RELIGIONS We're very impressed with your efforts, Secretary Yang. We feared you were up against too much. I'm glad you proved us wrong. Thank you, leaders, for your trust. Excuse me, but there are Falun Gong flyers falling from the sky. -Relative's name? -Fu Changjiu. Fu was executed. -What? -No one contacted you? I thought he was given fifteen years? There was probably a retrial. Get Zhu. Yes, sir. Director Zhu, he needs to see you right away. Yes. January 23, 2001, is the Chinese New Year's Eve. Two self-immolations occurred near the People's Heroes Monument. One person died at the scene and four people were burned. Two others were stopped by police. They are all Falun Gong practitioners from Kaifeng city. The person who died is Liu Chunling. In order to ascend to heaven, they were willing to give up their lives. It's nonsense! All that work we did, trying to change people's minds? What is going on? You wouldn't be doing this. Mom, suicide is a sin. How can you believe this? Who are they? It has been proven that Falun Gong harms lives and endangers society. For the sake of people's peace and society's peace, It must be resolutely eradicated. It must be resolutely eradicated... ...resolutely eradicated. We interviewed the organizer of the self-immolation, Liu Fang. The self-immolation was for ascension to heaven. Why didn't you light yourself? As they were burning, I wondered why they did not ascend to heaven. Later, I figured it out. Because their practice hadn't reached the highest level, they couldn't ascend. The Chinese government's ban of Falun Gong has been warmly embraced by the general public. This unit! Why am I under arrest? I did nothing wrong-- Shut up. Move it. Hurry up. They are Falun Gong. They deserve it. The woman who died is from Kaifeng, a Falun Gong member, named Liu Chunling. The black smoke rising from her can be clearly seen on this footage captured by CNN. They said they got this footage from CNN. That's not hard to confirm. -Daniel? -Hey, Susan. Congratulations! That's a hell of a shot Hank got, I've been watching it on the news all day. That's not our shot, Daniel. We were arrested as soon as the fire began. We have no idea where it came from. But no one at CNN shot that footage. I think they just wanted us to catch a glimpse. Just enough to prove it happened. Anyway, about to shoot. -I got to go. -Okay, yeah. All right, take care. Who shot the tape? It's obviously a handheld camera, close enough to pick up his words. But how were they right there when it happened? Unless they knew it was going to happen. I think we should be cautious pushing this, Daniel. Or even worse, they set it up. This could mean that the government is conducting one of the largest-scale propaganda campaigns in history. You just want to ignore it? What happened to "standing up for what's right"? Why are you so adamant about bringing trouble onto yourself? People are being hurt, they're being killed, they're being jailed. If we don't act, if journalism isn't for this, then what's the point of doing it at all? But what if you get kicked out again? What if you never come back? Sometimes you have to compromise things you believe in to protect yourself. Min. How many times do we need to go over this, Daniel? -This is not worth the risk. -These people, I cannot sit by and watch them be manipulated -into turning against each other-- -Daniel! Take a deep breath. Look at this situation logically, okay? -I-- -You can't blow up your reputation there. Who could you help if you get kicked out again? Be smart, okay? -What's the smart thing to do here? -Well, I-- Oh, shit! Dan. Are you there? Oh, God. Dan. Did I lose you? -Dan! -No, no, I'm still here. Just thinking. Sorry, Pat. I just dropped my favorite teapot. Damn it. Hang on a second. Yeah, you know what? You're right. I've got my book to focus on, and building my career. What's the point of getting involved in something I'm not concerned with. I'm happy to hear that. Why not take a trip or something? -Relax. -Yeah. Talk later. What are you looking for? Invoices, for taxes. Right where they've always been. Ha! You know, I was thinking about getting out of town. Maybe visiting some historical cities. For the book. That's a good idea. Xi'an? Lesser known places, maybe. Ones that aren't written about. Right. Maybe Luoyang? It's known as the region where Chinese civilization originated. I was hoping for somewhere known for its food. -What do you think? -Of course you are. Maybe Kaifeng? It's not far from Luoyang. Two for the price of one. Sold. -You'll book the tickets? -Of course. You missed your report yesterday. Nothing important happened, really, we just-- It's not for you to decide what is important or not. Do I need to remind you what the consequences are? I'll be charged for being an accomplice if Daniel endangers national security. That's right. So tell me, what unimportant things happened today? He left for a trip. To Luoyang and Kaifeng. Why Kaifeng? I suggested it. He asked for ancient cities. Send someone to Kaifeng. Enjoy your meal. Hi, your meal is ready. Hello. I want this, this and this. These foreigners... Why? Do you know her? Yes. Liu Chunling. She lived nearby. Had you ever known her to practice Falun Gong? No, no. She is a prostitute in a night club. Really? Of course. You don't believe me? Ask Sun. They've been neighbors for years. Ah, Liu Chunling! She is sick here. She beats her mother at every turn. Thank you. Take care. Stop there. Play it again, but slow. There! -Someone hit her over the head, right? -Where? There it is! Oh, God. They wanted to make sure she was dead. Hello? Where is she? -Xia-- -You... ...come in. Thank you. Xia. I'm ashamed... ...to be in front of you. I, I told them everything. But, but I have to tell you something very important. The Tiananmen self-immolation is fake. What? How do you know? Remember Liu Fang, the so-called organizer? I saw him in the detention center. What's going on? We were forced to watch the video over and over. I swear I could recite it. I was working, one day... Don't worry, Liu. You'll be bailed out soon enough. Whatever the Party wants. You've done your country a great service. Where did you find them, anyway? You know I can't talk about that. Of course. Let's have a smoke. Liu, what a bold plan. Incredible. Isn't this proof? It's not enough. But it's a start. Xia, Would you be willing to talk to a reporter? Yes. But who dares to expose this? I might know someone. -How was the trip? -It was wonderful. You were... You were right about the food. Was it worth the journey? Yeah, it was... ...well worth it. What are you doing? Uh... Homework. Tsinghua University? Impressive. What are you studying? City planning. Continue with your studies then. All done for today, actually! Watch it! Falun Gong! This man is Falun Gong! Wang! Jun was arrested! -What? -Pack up! -Get the diapers! -Okay. Hurry! NO FALUN GONG Sit down and rest for a bit. I know. You're hungry. It's almost ready. It's okay. Don't cry. The bottle is almost ready. It's okay. Don't cry. The bottle's here. Can you find the diapers? Oh, no. I forgot them. I've specifically told you to bring the diapers! I panicked. I forgot. How come you didn't forget that garbage for your detector? We need this for tomorrow, it's integral to the plan. You still want to go tomorrow? Finally there's a foreign reporter interested in our story. This could change everything! How can we give up? What if you're arrested too? What about our baby? What about me? Li Tell me. Wang. You need to make a choice. Right now. Do you want me and the baby... ...or do you want to go tomorrow? Li, please don't do this. It's late. Where are you going? Li. Where are you going? Li. Li, let's go back and talk. Where are you going with the baby? Li! -Li. -Stop the car! Stop the car! Will you just listen to me? Li. Li. Li! How busy you are. Tell me, where's Wang? What are you up to? Tell me. What exactly is your plan? Last chance. I shouldn't have let him go. It's not your fault. If I went that day, Jun wouldn't have been arrested. Those police killed him, not you. But he died. Nothing we do will bring him back. They killed Jun... ...because he didn't tell them the plan. Wang. Wang. Wang! He wanted us to proceed. Do you want him to die for nothing? No. I can't allow them to take you back. You've suffered enough. Let me tell you something. They tortured me... ...in all kinds of ways in prison. Countless times, I thought about hitting my head against the wall and ending it all. But I told myself to hold on. I must get out of here alive. I must expose their crimes to the world. Now I'm out. But many people are still locked inside. I will go tomorrow, even if it's by myself. Passengers for train E-13 to Shanghai, please go aboard at platform... Hi, I was hoping to get a plumber sent to my apartment as soon as possible. Great. Okay. Yes. I can meet you there. Okay. Thanks. I have to go meet a plumber. See you tomorrow! -Hey, you the plumbers? -Yes. Thanks for coming on such short notice. Sorry in advance. It's a really big job. It's right up here. I was having trouble flushing it. A few days ago. And now it's completely broken. -Looks like a big job. -Yeah. How long do you think it will take? A few hours, probably. -All right, well, you better get started. -Okay. -Okay. Hi. -Hi. I want you to tell me everything about the confession you overheard in prison. Okay? It might be hard. But the details are important. He's really just getting his toilet fixed. This tip is a bust. They tortured me so many times. One day... ...they took off all of my clothes, and threw me into a men's cell until morning. Is there anything else you want to add? I would like to use my real name to add credibility. Okay. All right. I-- I have arranged for you to leave China tomorrow. No, no, I want to stay. For change. Are you sure? That's a big risk. Wait a second. How come there's a baby crying? We gotta go! We gotta go! We gotta go now! -Daniel, the tape recorder. -Why? -Do you have a cable? -Yes. It'll make them think we're still in the apartment. -Okay. -Shut down the elevators! Here. Come on, come on, come on. Okay, let's go. Hurry up! They are still in the apartment! See... -This is where we keep the hose... -Yeah. -And you get... -Yeah. Let me check. Okay, it's clear. Let's go. No sign of the target. No, no way. Okay, there's a, there's a back door, come on. No, we're stuck. Wait right here. Until you hear them pass. Then go for the back door. Wait, wait, wait, wait-- Get out of China! As soon as possible. Get down. Stop! Where is Daniel Davis? WANTED - NATIONAL ALERT FOR DANIEL DAVIS Have you seen this person? Where is he? Sir, I really don't know. I have already given all of the information. You were very close. The two of you. It's hard to believe that he would leave without telling you where he was going. He was my boss, nothing more. I swear to you. He left the office to run an errand and that was the last time I saw him. I, I really don't know where he is. It would be in your best interest to find out. Don't you think? If you find Daniel, what will happen to him? What you should be asking me is, what will happen to you... ...if he gets away? What are you doing? You are not a weak man, Wang. You have done everything you could. One needs to know when to retreat to fight another day. Do you really think an article by a foreigner can save Falun Gong? Tell me where Daniel is. You stay alive. And someday you'll get to hear your child call you "Dad." At least my child will grow up knowing that her father fought for the truth. The truth? From what, your little flyers? There are more than two thousand newspapers nationwide, circulating to millions every day. How many flyers do you really think you can print? One day, the lies will be seen for what they are. In the face of the truth, no matter what misinformation you spread, people will see through it. Even your military and police may turn against you. Did it ever occur to you? Interesting. I have a question, though. Do you think you'll get to see that day? Ask yourself. You are an evil person in an evil machine. You'll either be destroyed by power struggles in the Party, or be brought to justice when the Party eventually falls. What use will the money and the power be, then? Everyone is a victim in a society with no truth or justice. And you are no exception. Enjoy. The car is here. It's time to go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Despite the spread of information to the Western world, persecution in China continues to this day. In fact... ...one of the key sources for this article is in prison, presumably being tortured, as I speak to you now. His name... ...is Wang Boyu. And more than anyone I've met on this journey, he embodied the principles of Falun Gong. Truth. Compassion. Tolerance. He risked everything for them. I only hope we will do the same. Now, there have been some concerns raised by Western countries. But little has been done to protect these innocent people. We must be more like Wang. We must do everything we can to bring the truth into the light. Thank you! Thank you. Thank you. Attention please, train number E-13 from Beijing has arrived at Shanghai station. Well, you won. We'll get a few diplomatic letters of concern, perhaps. Then, what? Soon you'll be executed in secret. And the world will forget. They'll forget this article. And you. And soon they'll forget Falun Gong altogether. I see. Enjoy your last meal. Secretary Yang! Secretary Yang! Perhaps due to international pressure, I was eventually sentenced to 8 years in prison. Those 8 years are supposed to be the prime of one's life. But for me it was a nightmare I'd rather not remember. After I was released, my family and I managed to find refuge in the U.S. However, many practitioners I know are still persecuted in China. Many religious groups, ethnic minorities and political dissidents are still suppressed. The Chinese regime still lies to its own people and to the whole world. I believe that no matter how powerful lies are, if we all seek the truth, insist on the truth and tell the truth, truth will ultimately prevail.
