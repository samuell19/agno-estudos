Congratulations. Congratulations. And it won't make a difference to J.B. either. He'll find many others who can work for him. There is one thing, my life will get settled. But Jagpal Bir won't get a P.A. like Simran. Can I say something, Jassa? You'll earn good deeds by taking.. ...under your wing an orphan girl. God is watching us. - God will watch later!

You were laughing and dancing a moment ago. ...before you have seen me and made this drama. J.P. sahib he has become mad. Shut up. I understand everything. I will not give you even five cents.. ...and forget about five million dollar. You can see that what I can do. Change my name if | don't make you regret this. No no for this work why you are giving trouble to your self. You may change your name. ho problem. Don't jump too high, Khanna. The court in which you kept losing. ..I have won many cases there.. | know the ways of the court very well. If you know so much about law.. the court in which you kept losing.. ...that court's decisions are made on evidence. And we've a lot of evidences. And you.. you've nothing. I've money. Mr. Khanna, money. Do you know the power of money? I'll ruin you. Impostor lover. I had understood that this person is fooling my Simran. Again if you have taken the name of .. ...the Simran then I will run the bulldozer on you. I'll cut you into pieces and hang them at downtown's poles. I'll kill you. - Sir. - What is it? Take this. 'If you take Simran's name again.. Then I'll flatten you with a bulldozer.".. I will prepare some false witnesses .. ...and prove that the mental condition of my .. ...client is not good and he is threatening to finish him. He is threatening to run bulldozer on him He threatened to Kill him. You threatened that you'll cut him into pieces.. ...and hang them at the poles of downtown. Anything else if you want to threaten then tell me. I will give reply of this in the court you understand. I will not leave you. Don't keep the anger within yourself. You may understand it properly. That also I will see. Simi, I swear on God I've never seen such fraudsters in my life. That Jassa is a dramatist. And that Jassa, he is a number one impostor. He was dancing before I went inside. He wanted to take five million dollar from me. But I will not give him even one cent. Uncle please definitely you had some misunderstanding. Jassa is not this type man. If he is not like this then what type of man. Am I wrong? Whom do you favour me, or Jassa? Go away. Sir, look at this. Look at this, sir. What he look after. My three sons are behind me. My own people are not my well wisher. They have now become well wisher of the Jassa. Make them understand. Relax. Relax, Mr. J.B. See your blood pressure is going high now. Keep her away. Sorry Jagpal sahib you should understand.. ...but you are not listening to any one. Leave him. Sit your B.P. is going to be higher. Relax! See I am your lawyer and without asking .. ...me you went to the house of Jassa and threatened to the doctor. If this will be going on then how I will fight your case. I will fight my own case. You are fighting this case only in a year. Uncle please you are being trapped by speaking all these. For God sake you relax now. | have done that accident knowingly. No! That idiot dramatist has.. If I allowed then.. In that eventuality they will file one more case. First tell me who amongst you all is with me. Mr. Jagpal, we all are with you. But you won't say anything without asking me, that's all. Tell me, what should I do! For now, we've our case in the court tomorrow. We've to go there in the morning. Brother today is the case in court. Today it will be decided. Brother for the good luck take samosa. You eat. Good morning.. Mr. J.B. No morning will be good for you from tomorrow. This is very much injustice. There are four lawyers for you but Baldev Raj Khanna is not bothered. After your case all the lawyers will come to me seeking job. There is no treatment for the misunderstand to any doctor. | advise you to take the treatment from the same doctor. You have engaged the costly lawyers and paid them high price. But can not understand the strategy of the Baldev Raj Khanna. This you can not say without the income of samosa. From where this samosa has come. - It is very tasty. | asked you from where it came and who made it. The C.0. of my company Dumbaji has made it. Dumba! It is impossible thirty years the taste of .. ...the samosa of Putlighar, Amritsar and Karnal is still in my mouth. No other one can made this samosa. O.k. let him say Karnal Singh is running.. ...the restaurant in the karnal. Yes. -0.K. Sent this to the lab. Okay, I'll get it checked. Definitely you get it check up sir. Only Samosa. Take it. - We will check you all. You are playing very dangerous game. See you play carefully. Look you be careful,. I'll enjoy playing the game They will make you enjoy today. Come, come. I request Mr. Khanna to give permission to start .. ...the proceeding of the case in Punjabi. I have no objection. Thank you, Your Honour. Mr. Jagpal Bir Singh ji there is charges of negligent against.. ...you that you were driving without the valid driving license.. ...and you have made accident.. ...with the Jasawar Singh alias Jassa Singh while.. ...he was crossing the signal He has internal injuries. How do you plead? Not guilty. Your honour my client Jagpal Bir Singh is a famous .. ...and law binding citizen. Since last thirty years he is staying in Canada .. ...and never met with any accident during these thirty years period. Accident is far away but he has not been .. ...penalized even a single time also. Just one small mistake that he has not renewed the .. .License of the driver does not proof that he is not a good .. ...and safe driver. Mr. Khanna wants to take .. ...the advantage of the small mistake .. ...and filed loss suit of five million dollar. ...that not Jasawar Singh's injuries.. ...but the greed of easy money. Your Honour, their case lies on the basis of three things. Lie, only lie and nothing but a lie. My client Jagpal Bir Singh agree that.. ...the injures that Jasawar Singh sustained.. .Till they are not completely healed.. And other than that my client will pay him 100 dollars a day.. .Till the time he isn't completely well. Other than that my client Jagpal Bir Singh.. ...takes the guarantee that he'll be completely cured. And listen, he'll also pray for him in the Sikh temple. Mr. Khanna you accept to this arrangement. Your Honour, I would like to ask a few questions to Mr. Singh. You may proceed. Thank you your honour. Sir your name. J.B. Singh. - Full name. Jagpal Bir Singh. Birth. What you have to do with birth. You ask about the driving. Ok. Since how many years you are in Canada. Since 1976. Last time when you have drive the car. 18 February! - Before 18 February when you have drive the car. | don't remember the date. One week two week four week months. Tell! Judge sahib after the business meeting my life was very hectic.. ...and that is why | kept this driver. When did you appoint him? January 2003. That's why you didn't renew your license after January 2003.. It's not that, it just slipped my mind. How many times have you driven.. The car between January 2003 and 18th February?.. I never needed to. That means never. Yes. While driving or before driving on 18th February.. ...did you know that your license has been expired from many years? - No. On or before 18th February did you know.. ...that your company's executive who lives in your house, she is.. Your Honour, she means more than a daughter to me. Okay, no problem. Good. So Mr. J.B., I would like to know On or before 18th February did you know.. ...that your company's executive who is more than a daughter to you.. ...was having an affair with my client Jasawar Singh? What rubbish! Objection, Your Honour. - Sustained. Your honour the man who has never done driving .. ...since four years and never met with an accident.. ...in last thirty years. He has never been punished for speeding ticket .. ...suddenly he decide to drive the car. And how he comes in front of his car, Your Honour? Your honour the executive of his company came. He loves to his girl Simran. Simran also .. ...loves to my client Jassa but the main problem is that .. ...he does not ready to accept their love. Objection, Your Honour. - Overruled. I don't have any hesitation in saying this as well sir .. ...Jagpal Bir Singh has knowingly with full sense .. ...of humour has tried to kill my client. - Objection, Your Honour! - Sustained. Mr. Khanna, no assumptions. Mr. J.B. two days back you went to the house of Jasvir Singh. Your honour I went there. | was ready to accept all these terms. Because Simran told me everything.. ...between her and Jassa after the accident. | wanted to accept their terms.. ...and end this thing out of the court. | was only concerned about Jassa's wellbeing. But I went there and got angry. When I say that Jassa is absolutely well. Strange, you just said you were very concerned about his wellbeing. And then you got angry, just because he was alright? Yes. No. Yes or no? Give me an answer. When you came inside the house, what did you see? | didn't see that from inside the house. | saw it from outside the house. Forget what happened outside.. ...tell me what you saw when you went inside. | saw that this black guy was fanning him. And he was lying on the bed with a neck band.. ...and breathing heavy. What else do you expect, that a person will dance.. ...after having an accident with car? All of them were dancing. Yes. All of them were dancing. And that black guy, he too was dancing. Mr. J.B., you just said that he was.. ...breathing heavy lying on the sofa. Now you're saying that he was dancing. What you want to say. | said that when I went out of the house then he was dancing .. ...and when I came in then.. I'm completely confused! I'm really confused. Sahib is telling some time that he was inside and some time outside. Sometimes he says that they were dancing. And sometimes say that they were ill. Mr. Khanna what you want to say. Your honour I feel that before proceeding further .. ...in this case it would be better to clear .. ...the confusion about the mind of the J.B. saab. You want to prove that there is some problem in my mind .. ...and I am mad. Why | am looking mad to you. Mr. J.B, why are you saying that. A psychiatrist will decide that. Judge sahib this false and baseless lawyer .. ...has defamed the entire community of the lawyers. When they were in their country they used to mess.. ...around and they didn't change even after coming here. Your honour you have seen and heard him in totality. Now I don't want to ask more questions to waste the time. Oh God I have not done any crime for .. ...which I am getting such a punishment. The court gives order to Mr. Jagpal Bir Singh that until.. ...his medical report is not presented in this .. ...court till then the court is suspended. Come. What is this? - Sir, after we reach home. What will you do after going home? - Let's go. - Offer me mangoes? See Dusajh saab this girl has reached me to the mental hospital. Not the mental hospital but to the psychiatrist. Psychiatrist means the same. The doctor for the insane. No sir, psychiatrist is the one who finds.. ...out the misunderstandings of the mind and clears them. | have no misunderstanding. Yes it is O.K. Come let's ask the madam what's the time.. I mean.. I know the timing. Yes | asked where Dr. Palta. - Come. Hello. - Good afternoon, sir. I've an appointment with the doctor at 2 o'clock. Oh, okay. Oh Mr. Jackpaul Bir Singh? - Jagpal Bir Singh. Jackpaul Bir Singh. - Jagpal Bir Singh. Jagpal Bir Singh - Sir.. sir.. you go inside and have the meeting. Sir you go inside and meet the doctor I will tell her in English. Yes, that's okay. He is a famous person. -'Jag' means world. Okay. - 'Pal' means who can take care of the world. Oh, interesting. - He's the person. - Very interesting. Hello. Hello? Hello! Quickly call Dr. Palta. Hello! Hello! Hello! You didn't recognise me. Are you my uncle's son that I would recognise you? Go and call Dr. Palta, fast. You just put pressure on the mind and recognise me. They have made me mad now. Don't worry Dr. Palta is here. I've returned thrice from Haryana hence, Dr. Palta. Pleasure meeting you, mister.. Oh yes. You only tell, me that what you will take.. ...coffee, tea, lemon, soda.. No, no, I don't want anything. Just give me the certificate that I'm well. You will not refuse me. What is this? You also know to this samosa. You also know this samosa. Then would also know the maker of it. Yes correct. Number one Jassa Singh. Not one or two or three he is number ten. And the two guys with him too are frauds. They are they ghost who are after my life! Strange, I never knew that ghosts can make such good 'Samosas'. Joking. Joking. - No, joking! They are spirits. Spirits! Mr. Jagpal Bir Singh. - Jagpal Bir Singh. J.B. - Whatever. Not whatever! It's J.B.! Yes that's what I meant! But clear one thing.. ...what are they ghosts or spirits? Had you been in contact with them you would have known.. ...that what kind of ghosts and spirits they are. Strange that means only 'Samosas'.. ...are owned by ghosts and spirits? By the time you come to know what cheats and frauds.. ...they are, I would have gone completely insane. I won't let that happen. - What? Let you go insane. You tell me what are the misunderstandings.. ...which trouble you the most. Mr. J.B., misunderstandings spread.. ...inside a human brain like worms and parasites. You have to remove the veils over.. ...misunderstandings from your life. It is as difficult as breaking mangoes without a stick. Parasites, worms, mangoes, what do you think.. ...I am here to get mangoes? Forgive me, thank you very much. That's it! No no just the session started and after four five .. ...session I will send my report to the court. Four five session. -Yes I am not going to do any session with you. Whatever report you want you may send to the court. Forgive me see just | started to be mad.. ...and see started to speak hindi. Thank you. Listen J.B. sahib | am telling you a fact. This life is very beautiful and lives this beautiful life .. ...with love and affection. They have made my life very difficult. If you will also do the same then .. ...what will be difference between them and you. The son of God. -Yes Well the son of the god I am the devil.. ...and I don't need, much, lecture now. See again I have started in hindi. Now forgive me I am going. He will not understand. He is also the son of the god. But he is hot temper man. Oh God you make him understand. Bye. Simran any body can be mad to go to Dr. Palta. | am giving the money and it seems that the gang of .. ...the Jassa has been everywhere. They make my blood boil! Uncle you please don't say like that. I know very well to the Jassa and he can never do bad to any one. He's not like that, he can never be! Then you don't know to the Jassa. He is a crook. Vancouver is full of such good men. And you liked only Jassa? He loves me, uncle. He loves to your money. My daughter you have always seen me like a strict boss only. But the fact is I have always tried to keep you.. ...away from all the problems. I know that you love so much to the Jassa but you .. ...are very much innocent. This world is full of the cheater like the Jassa Singh. | don't know why you understand him a good man. But there is no one cheater man like him in this entire world. Uncle please enough I don't want to listen anything bad about Jassa. Perhaps you also don't want that me and Jassa.. My daughter. Please I don't want to listen anything. I don't know whether you did that accident knowingly. Simran | don't know uncle what happen. | have never seen him like this. | think someone has brainwashed him. This is the brain wash of the car owners. I am not joking uncle. He is very upset. He feels that all of you are playing drama. I have played few dramas in the college. But if he does not like drama then I will sing few songs. I'm serious. - Serious? Yes. Don't say how serious. Uncle had great misunderstanding and he feels.. ...that all of you are fraud. Fraud means. By fraud it means you what you're.. ...saying and showing is not true. Oh. This means we're not humans. Jassa please for the sake of God you be serious. Well then you also giving swear of god some .. ...time you ask me to be serious for you also. I am in tension. Oh -Yes Then ask me what you want. Uncle feels that all of you are very much selfish .. ...and as if nothing happen. He was telling that all of you are behind his dollars. Yes Simran I have spoken so much .. ...lie and now I can not speak more. But this is fact that now you are sitting in front of my photo. J.B. saab is also correctly telling that nothing happen to me. Means. Means nothing happen to me. Then for what this false. Just to give the punishment to the J.B. for his deeds. But why? Punish him for what? The thing which didn't happen? Why this drama? For dollars? Five seven million dollar's makes no difference to him .. ...but our life will pass comfortably. Jagpal Bir Singh has no relation neither with you nor with me. Oh My God but I have done today I have charged.. ...uncle for such a big false. For you again like you a liar and cheat. Simran please listen to me. Now I don't want to listen a single world. | was taking swear of the honesty of the man. Please don't misunderstand me. Misunderstand? Now I understand you! Listen to me, Simran! - Don't touch me! Don't touch me! I trusted a liar like you and accused that angel! | hate myself! Simran you have done nothing wrong. | don't want that whole life you do the service .. ...of the Jagpal Bir Singh. For the sake of both of us. For both of us. For both of us or for yourself? I would have destroyed my whole life. But now I could never forgive myself. Simran. Simran. Simran. It's no one's fault. It's one's destiny. The one close to heart; broke my heart. The same atmosphere, the same weather. The same are the winds playing with the flowers. | don't like anything. The world looks strange. The loved ones are now strangers. It's no one's fault. It's one's destiny. You were the moon of my beautiful sky. There came clouds of sadness came.. ...and you too shied away. You don't know how to love. The loved ones are now strangers. It's no one's fault. It's one's destiny. When I look in the mirror | don't recognise myself. My heart doesn't understand. No excuses work. My heart doesn't understand. No excuses work. Where has destiny brought me?! The loved ones are now strangers. It's no one's fault. It's one's destiny. My daughter you forget whatever happens. Forget him. I'll forget him. | can even forgive him for what he did. But.. How will I ever forgive myself for what I did? You should never forgive me. No Simran no. no my son. My sons who when went to the God.. ...to leave me then you came to me. That time only I got the purpose of living my life. Then only I have decided that I will make you so strong .. ...that you will look after my all the business. Dusajh saab. Yes sir. You put the date on the papers. The space for the date if blank since 13 years. But it seems I have to put today date. Give me the papers. Simran my daughter you sign this adoption paper. Uncle. This is the last time speaking this word. Daddy. Once more. Papa. -God. There is no one like you in the whole world. You're truly the best. | promise I'll never let you down. Promise. | promise. | got deviated. I'm not worthy of your love. No body knows that what you deserve. I am happy that you understand that he is not fit for you love. Even knowingly also I could not tell you that you are .. ...the alone heir of my all the business. | could have done this earlier also but I don't wanted that any kind of careless ness come in your life. Now I am sure that you will fulfill this responsibility with sincerity. I'm sorry. - No. No. Enough. Enough, my dear, enough. Bastard for the sake of the five million dollars. Those three goons, thugs. I'll show all that they are hardcore criminals. Mr. Dosanijh is the captain of your team. He is a renowned lawyer of Canada. Teach Khanna and his friends such a lesson.. ...that even his future generations.. ...wouldn't dare to thug like this. I'll make him regret it. He has an army of lawyers ready. All of them must be sitting in a brainstorming session. They must be scratching their heads.. They must be scratching their heads.. ...to try and find out legal hooks. Law is a big playground. Let's see how far he can run. I will run like that Jagpal Bir in the court that he will start screaming. He will come with five million dollars and give us. I will not give even five cent also. This is the question of my honour. My business rivals will laugh at me. | can not tolerate it. The biggest crime of the Jassa is that .. ...he has trapped my daughter. First he has made fool to the Simmi and then come to me. I want to see his defeat under any circumstances. | don't bother about the expenditure whatever it may be. What expenses you are talking? | have never seen such a foolish man in my life. But you see my name is also Khanna. I will make him mad. You will leave me as mad. | can not concentrate in my business whole day .. ...and night only one thing is hammering on my head. The disaster of the Jassa. I will throw you in.. ...such a hell that you will never imagine in the dream also. Mr. Dosanjh, it's difficult for nice people.. ...to get such scoundrels out of their hearts. | can't see my daughter sad anymore. Get rid of these people from our lives. Give those rascals what they want. Finish the case. After Mr. J.B, surrenders the case.. .,this court orders Mr. Jagpal Bir.. - Listen to me, Khanna.. That they should give Mr. Jasawar Singh, 5 million dollars. Shut up the decision is being taken in our favour. All expenses.. - Your Honour.. Jassa what are you doing this. L.. want to say something to the court. - Sure. Judge saab the matter which I was understanding .. ...my life is the biggest defeat of my life. Whole life I was thinking about the easy money .. ...and easy life and left my all the friends, relatives .. ...and also to our country. | came to leave my mother and in this country. | have taken as granted to the law of this country .. ...for getting the dollars. | understand it is my right. | have only disregarded the law of this country. Judge sahib I could not fulfill my duty for the sake.. ...of my own country and also ashamed to this country also. | thought that love was a business, Your Honour. And I thought of business as my love. Judge sahib for the same of money.. ...I have done the business of love. Judge sahib now I am recalling the words of my mother.. ...which she said to me. | forget that what my mother said to give respect to the love. | priced my love, which was priceless. God has punished me for the dealings I did in love. Now I am standing as a accused in your court. You give the judgement of your law. | Jasawar Singh son of Shamsher Singh confessed.. ...I have filed is based on the false statement only. All these I did for the sake of the money only. | thought that five million dollars.. ...can be earned by speaking a small lie. If it is possible then it is cheap for every citizen. In view of the confession .. ...and evidence of the Jasawar Singh, the court debar.. ...for three years to the Baldev Raj Khanna for filing false .. ...case for the sake of earning dollars .. ...and also for defamation of this court. Further the court imposed fine of one thousand dollar.. ...to Mister Jasawar Singh for being involved in this case. | don't deserve any kind of excuse but even then.. .If it is possible you please forgive me as my last mistake. Either you said for the forgive or otherwise. But both is not possible. Brother for the sake of God don't go to leave us. If it would be in my hand then I never go to leave my friend. But I will try to start the new life in the new shape. You think what she will think about you. No my dear friend you don't try to change my decision. No no you change. When you will change yourself. If you will be thinking about yourself .. ...then what will happen to us. If it's good then you think about yourself. If it's bad then too you think about just yourself. Pal. - Leave it! What friend and what friendships! But who will understand to our friendship. Now whatever you want you do it. Hey.. this is not friendship. No my friend. Both of you set your business . And let me go please. Jagpal Bir and his army? Look.. this was the only thing missing. I was not knowing that you are going to leave .. ...the battle field like a coward man. But Jassa this is the beginning of the game. Jagpal Bir Singh will never allow you to go like this. You have to do everything here only. Defeat. No if and no buts totally unconditional. Sign here . Oh my God. I can't believe it. Jassa.. Jassa, you know what he means? | accept the punishment given by you. Then what you are waiting here. Sign. Jassa this is not the punishment. This is you are fulfilling the dream of the Jagpal Bir Singh. You are telling but you will get one dollar for one samosa. Jagpal Bir Singh ji will pay five thousand rupees daily. The equipment and machinery for making the samosa .. .Will be financed by the Jagpal Bir Singh {I.. ...Jassa your dream to become millionaire has been fulfilled. Now you please sign here immediately. Jassa Singh what are you thinking. No sir I am not a big businessman. I have lost my own house here .. ...and don't want to do anything dealing with any one. Forgive me. | also came here thirty years back like you to with .. ...SO many desire to fulfill here to leave my country. After myself thousand of people came here. | am not appreciating myself but this is the fact I said. Today there is no one who can sit near Jagpal Bir Singh. Do you know why? I have endured everything, storms, calamities.. ...cyclones, troubles, problems. But I never left the company of two things. One is the hard working and other is honesty. And third thing is this, the one which I've got my ancestors.. ...I never let this turban be separated from me. It was not so easy 30 years ago to work with this turban on. Helplessness made many remove these turbans.. ...but I salute all those won't didn't lose courage. Just on the basis of their hard work.. ...they kept their pride honour and prestige.. ...of their religion alive all over the world. Never Kill your desires. Nor let your desires kill your conscience. I'm happy that.. See your all the desire has been fulfilled. But sir my all the desire are finished when I will not get her. No. I should repent for my sins. - You"ll be punished, Jassa Singh. Jassa ii you have washed out the dirt on your heart .. ...and your atonement is now completed. Good Jagpal Bir Singh {I whom you want to meet. Congratulations. Our thinking will meet when.. Yes. Will know. The boy was good; we wasted our time fight the case. Tell me. That was great, Jassa.
