I told you, I don't believe in this. But it's your birthday present. I'd rather have an Agatha Christie, thank you very much. You don't want to know what your husband would be like? No. Well, mine looks like Tom Cruise, fights like Jackie Chan and is as rich as the Sultan of Brunei. The fortune-teller told you that? No. My diary. And don't change the subject, go on! Fate is like a book hidden from our sight. Yet, our stories were written in it before we were born. Sometimes we get a rare peep into that book, and it becomes deeply imprinted on our hearts. Sometimes for many years to come. Sit. You want to know about your other half. He's like the wind. Your fates lie with the wind. One must lose it to find it. Patience is the key. And this man, this man who is like the wind, became my first love story in that temple. Since then, I held a torch for you. I began looking out for you, even before I met you. But one doesn't finally meet the Right One. We are in each other all along. But I was too young to know it then. Hey look! Here she comes. So? Quick! What did he tell you? Well, he said... I'll marry a man who looks like Tom Cruise... ...fights like Jackie Chan and is as rich as the Sultan of Brunei. My readers asked how I fell in love. The only answer I could give was 'gradually, and then suddenly'. That was how we happened. And it all happened on February 29th. Over the years I sought out more fortune-tellers, to peep further into the book of fate. Everything they told me has come true. Up until now. They told me the year I turned 48 I could lose everything. But my everything is you. The doctors are not optimistic about your condition. But I need you to be strong for us, and for Dyllan. Today is February 29th. Today I turn 48. You once made a promise that we would always meet again on February 29th. I need you to keep your promise today. You have been sleeping for far too long. Wake up. Please, wake up! Dyllan, I didn't know you were home. And you shouldn't sleep in so much. You lose half a day. Please don't lecture me. Oh! Wait right here. Happy Birthday! Thank you! Thank you! It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves - William Shakespeare Plato, the Greek philosopher, believed that primeval man was made of two human beings. They had four hands, four feet, two heads looking opposing ways. They could walk backwards and forward as they pleased. Now these original men were so powerful that the gods felt threatened. So they decided to... cut them into two. Us. Each one of us, being one half of a man, is always looking for his other half. So 'Love', as defined by Plato, is that ancient desire to reunite with the other, recovering our original nature, seeking to make one of two, and through finding that, attain true happiness... There she is! Hey, we've been looking all over for you! Hi! Where have you been? What's that? My other half. Your other half's a blue whale? Oh. Hahaha. Very funny. Oh come on, how do you even know it's him? I saw him in a dream, just like Mr Pereira said. Oh, so that's what they mean by "dreamlover". Well, I will definitely recognize a man with a million dollars when I see him. You know what my problem is? My problem is... I've got too many halves. Oh, you are just... No, they're all pretty fit you know. 1 st Leap Year On the day I turned 6, I made my birthday wish. That one day, this blurry blue image would finally clear into your face. Surprise! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! "Be realistic, find someone you can live with", they say. I wanted someone I can't live without. What did you wish for? More sleep. A boyfriend! No, I'm only 6 years old and I'm too young for that. Liar! You do think of him. What do you know! It's the blue whale. Are you still thinking about that Plato-other-half shit? No. Now I subscribe to the Mills and Boon philosophy of love. How do you know it's not KS? Yes. You have to explain why you hang around with that deadweight. Smelling of formo... formal... Formaldehyde. No car. He's my best friend. No, he's in love with you. No, he's not. It's just old games we play. But how do you know that you're not in love with him? You're all my best friends and I'm not in love with you. Don't be too sure of that, honey. Hey, I need to get changed, will you wait for me please? Oh no, no, sorry pal. The last time I waited for you I got blacklisted by my boss! Jennie! Jennie! Yes, you're a teacher. Can't you get an alarm clock? You can't always be late, okay. Oh, your mom said to make sure you eat this. Oh, yummy! Okay, I'm going to give this to your Mom. Bye! Thank you. Mom, I'm late, where are you? I'm in here. Still not finished? Almost done. So, who's the lucky girl? Aunty Chen's daughter or Uncle Biao's mistress? Neither. It's for a very pretty girl who needs it today. There! Happy birthday! For me? It's beautiful mom! Thank you. Silly girl. I decided on this design after looking through many magazines. This is for you to wear when you go on dates. Good. I'll wear it when I date you, okay? Don't try to be funny. Since young, you were always buried in your books. Always collecting 'A's but not a single 'B'. And that's a bad thing?! B is for boyfriend! You silly girl! 24 this year and no boyfriend. There must be something wrong. Yup, the wrong lies with the boys. I think the problem lies with you. You should find time to go out on dates. If you continue to nag, I'll be late for work, and that'll be a big problem! Remember to collect the ribbons from Auntie Khoo. Okay, bye bye. So to make seasons fall at exactly the right place every year we add one day every four years, and that is today. Which is? February 29th. Very good. So certain traditions mark this day. For example, a particularly interesting one from Ireland in the 5th century. When Saint Bridget complained to Saint Patrick, about women having to wait such a long time for men to propose. What are we going to do for your birthday tonight? Something simple. No, come on. Simple is boring. We need to spice it up a little bit. Oh! Li-Ann says, there's a tradition today right. Where women can propose to any man and they cannot refuse. Really? What happens if they do? They get fined. And apparently, apparently, Saint... Bridget started it in Ireland a very long time ago. Excellent, Kim. Thank you. If only guys knew about it here, it'd make dating so much easier. It'll take a rare guy to know that. In fact, I'll bet they don't even know who Saint Nicholas is. Who's Saint Nicholas? Kim! Santa Claus! Oh... And you know, I think we should do it in Singapore. We'll be like pioneers, entrepreneurs of the dating world. I can see it right now. "Saint Suneetha of Singapore!" Oh, yeah right. Breaks my heart to leave you guys, but I've got to go. Oh, we are going force you to do something tonight. You are not staying home alone. Yes! Or hanging out with that loser, KS! Li-Ann! KS, how are you? Happy birthday. All your favourite songs. Queen? Barry Manilow. I take my hat off you. Thank you. Hey, you want to go to the movies? Excuse me? You are asking me out? Don't be silly. I've known you since we were kids. Anyway, I am not free. KS, come on. We're good friends right? One day, I'll find a doctor, to take you out of my head and then you'll regret. It. Regret it. Yes. Regret it. Okay. I'll see you tonight. Bye. On the day I turned 6, the direction of the wind began to change. Right here, at the Windows Cafe. My whole life began to move in the direction of the wind. Excuse me. Yes? Can I have a chiffon cake and a coffee to go please? Oh! Jesus! Christ! I'm, oh! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Here, let me, let me clean that for you. No, no. Don't worry. Oh, no, no. I didn't mean it. It's okay, just take a seat please. Miss, your chiffon cake and coffee. Okay, thank you. Yes, less red, more yellow. And most importantly, when will the goods arrive? You have to hurry. I need them urgently. A saint once decreed that a man must agree to a woman's proposal today. So I'm writing to see if you'd partake with me, a date. Partake with me, a date? I call myself a teacher? Give me a sign, as I'm hidden from your eyes, to meet me at eight, at the same place you sit, to fulfill the tradition of February 29th. This is yours if you take this, to that man over there. Are you crazy? O.K. I did it! I'm going out on a date. Oh my god! I don't believe it! Who with? Oh no! Not with KS. No, not with KS. That's not a date right? Sly yourself. Who is it? Quick, tell me! Okay. I met him at the Windows Cafe? Oh actually we haven't met yet, and... he was sitting there and... You are so making sense to me. I wrote him a note and asked him out. Just like Saint Bridget. I can't believe it, is this crazy? Oh my god! We have to tell the girls, quick! No, you tell them. Because I've got to get home and get ready. I won't be able to join you tonight. I'm really sorry. See you later, okay? Bye! I feel like a little girl Trying to conquer the whole wide world Everybody wants a piece of me And I just don't know where to turn I've got work piled up to my head All I want to do is jump into bed And wash away my troubles with lemonade Play hide and seek with the boy next door Take a trip to Singapore And imagine how I made a world a better place. Yes? Going out with KS? No. Then, who? I don't know. You don't know? At least, tell me his name. I don't know his name. You don't know the name of the person you're going out with? I already said, I don't know. Don't you at least know his background? Nope. What on earth... Where did you find him? Lucky draw? Mom, sit. Okay mom, what is it you want? You worry when I didn't date, and when I do. My daughter's gone nuts. Mom, don't worry, I can take care of myself. I'll tell you everything when I come back, okay? Be careful, he could be a con man. Don't give him your address or phone number. Yes, mom. And you must ask to see his Identity Card... Okay. Okay. I need to get ready. Okay, bye. Hey. Hey. It's just a movie, you know. I should have changed. Your mom didn't pass you the message? What message? I'm going out tonight with someone. Is he blue and blurry? Yes, in a way. Yes. I thought I was bad, but you, you really need a doctor. Bye bye. Are you okay? I'm too embarrassed to check. Let me help you up. It's nice to meet a fellow klutz. Between you and me, we'll thrash this place in no time. Oh, hi. I'm Jeremy. Li-Ann. Listen, I'm so embarrassed. I've never done this before and this is the first time. I think we should sit. We're starting to get an audience. Sorry. Excuse us. This is also the first time I've accepted an invitation like this. Why did you accept? Didn't want to get a fine. I only have a couple of hours to run some important errands, but I came because I had to meet this amazing poet. So do you think you can forget what mommy taught you And spend the rest of the night with a complete stranger? Why not? All right, let's go then. Hey! Uncle Ah Chai! Pretty girl! Girlfriend? Li-Ann, this is Uncle Ah Chai. Uncle Ah Chai, Li-Ann. Hello. So, fried kway teow? Yes. Extra chilli. You always remember. Okay, five minutes, and it will be ready. All right, all right. I'm intrigued. Love letters. Yes. It's my thesis, love letters as literature. Where'd you get your material? Family, friends, radio, music. Dead writers? You will include your own, I hope? Actually, I don't write them. You don't write them? I analyze them. What is said, what is not said, what is implied. Do you know the most commonly used word in love letters is 'miss', not 'love'? Have you ever been in love? I feel... The right one hasn't come along? I think you're brave. No, I'm serious. Most people need to be with someone. They can't wait to fall in love because they are afraid of being alone. I think it takes courage to resist being with someone just for the sake of being with someone. And are you speaking from experience? Jeremy! It's ready! Saved by the bell. Auntie Wan! Ah... You're here! Hi. Jeremy is here! Jeremy, you're here! This is Li-Ann. How are you? Godma! How are you? Please take a seat. You've grown taller. Your favourite, your favourite. Here. Fried kway teow. Godma, no, it's too oily! Come on! She loves it! Just a little bit, it's okay. Look at her, she's so happy. She doesn't recognize even her daughter, except for Jeremy. Jeremy is a very filial. Always give her money. He dotes on her. It's for you, keep it, keep it. Come, eat. Godma, this is Li-Ann. Li-Ann. How are you? My Min Min is a very good boy. He's never given anyone trouble. If you marry him, you take good care of him. He likes his rice steaming hot. And his porridge soft. His trousers must be ironed sharp, like knives. Okay? Godma, you must be tired. You should go rest now. I was born here 24 years ago. They're tearing it down for new buildings. I used to come up here at night to lie down. I'd close my eyes, let the wind pass over me, and then I was flying. Over the buildings, above the clouds, I was searching, looking for something. See that building over there? My dad used to take me up to the rooftop when I was a child. It was our secret. He said if I wrote a wish on a piece of paper and then let it fly the Gods would make it come true. But, I never knew what to ask for. So my papers were always blank. May what Li-Ann wishes for come true. Guess that solves it. And Jeremy's too. Here, let it fly. May we one day know what to wish for. How old are you? Six. Today. Six, today? You were born on February 29th? Yes. You're really quite special. Here, I've got something for you. A present. May the wind grant you your wishes. So, don't lose it? Thank you. So, where shall we go next? Actually, I should probably go. It's already been over two hours. Okay. I had a great time tonight. Me too. I wish I didn't have to leave. Me too. But there's always a next time, right? I'd love to see you again, but... But... I don't know when I can. The reason I've been visiting all my childhood memories and... and why I've to go now. The thing is, I'm leaving. I'm sorry. I really should have told you earlier. It's okay. I mean, figures right? It figures I'll meet someone nice and then something has to happen. Just my luck. I also had a great time tonight. When I got that sweet, awful poem of yours, I didn't know what to expect. I had to meet you, just to find out what kind of person would do something crazy like this. A crazy loser. Hey! How about we make a promise? We meet every February 29th. Same time, same place. Okay, but we'll still keep in contact right? Of course. We have to. Even the lovers in the Moon, they meet once a year. So the story goes. Li-Ann. I won't forget the promise. And... I won't forget this. See you. If a man promises to meet you once every leap year, but there is no one around to hear it, does it make a sound? In the next four years, not a word from you. That made a sound. A very loud silence. I didn't know what to make of it. We had such a rare connection. And then, you were gone. You met, had one date and he left? And the next thing in here is dated 4 years later? What happened? Nothing happened. Nothing. No letters, no phone calls, no-emails. Nothing? Why? I guess sometimes, things are left unsaid. Is this going somewhere about me? I just wanted to talk. Sorry, let's just talk another time. I couldn't get you out of my mind. My mind circled around the strange promise made. That we would meet again, same place, same time on February 29. Career-wise, I am moving along. But otherwise, I was always moving, but never moving on. Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous Albert Einstein 2nd Leap Year My friends kept asking. It was hard defending a man who wasn't there. Like a child explaining an imaginary friend. Sometimes I wondered if he only lived in my head. Wake up. Wake up! Happy birthday! Eat this for good luck. Thank you, Mom. Your table is in a mess. Some things should be thrown away. If you can't let go the old to welcome the new? It's... cute. Kim already has a 3-year-old daughter. What are you waiting for? This is very yummy. Finish it before you go to work. Mom? Li-Ann! Hi, Auntie Khoo! Is there something wrong with your eyes? It's the sun. It's too bright... Congratulations. Your mother told me that you've been promoted. Head of... head of what? Head of Literature. You're so clever and pretty, but what a waste. Auntie Khoo, not again please. You think I still dare? Do you know how many I've introduced to you? And you turned them all down! Even Terence Lee, son of the High Court judge. I don't know where to hide my face. Don't worry. I'm here to attend to your mother. My mom wants to be matchmade? Sorry. My sister just called from Hong Kong. I told her about your promotion. What's wrong with your eyes? Nothing. I've got to go to work now. Enjoy your workout. Bye bye. What about that friend of yours, KS? He may be poor, but he's got a good heart. Bye bye. Hi. Hey, I thought you're supposed to wait for the birthday girl before you start celebrating. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Wine? Thank you. Last I had checked, you'd quit. Well, there's a 200% tax on these things, so one mustn't waste? So what is up? James is not leaving his wife. Suneetha, that's enough drinking for now. You know, I knew what I was getting into. What is it they say... it's better to have loved, it's better... 'Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all. Tennyson. Anyway, it's your birthday, and we are going to celebrate it with a bang. Yes, with hundreds of people we've never even seen before. Oh yes, and a special one. At Kim's fabulous house. Her parties, they've become so fancy. I've nothing to wear. Can you please go get yourself some decent rags, for heaven's sake! I know you do this on purpose to keep men away right? Don't worry, Kim is taking me shopping. Good! And remember, sexy! Plunging necklines! Well it's about time you show some skin, honey. When you've got it, flaunt it! Cheers to the cleavage! Too short. Too loud. Too sexy. Oh, come on! What is this? Oh, Minnie mouse! You look great! So? This is... perfect. My turn now. I have just bought the best earrings. It's him. Who? It's Jeremy, look. Are you drunk or something? Don't be daft, that's his Godma. Maybe he came for her celebrations? And he didn't call you? How could he? He doesn't know my number. Now that is not an excuse. If he really wanted to find you, he would find you. He's probably married. Honey, you can't expect anything from him. You can be his friend, just like what KS is to you. So please, please, make yourself beautiful for your party, because I have a surprise for you! Oh Kim, no. I beg you. No surprises. Honey, he wasn't right for you. He wasn't wrong either. So stop beating me up for wasting, however long it's been. 4 years. Listen, the next time you fall in love, you make sure you tell him. You tell him straightaway. Whisper it in his ear or write it on the mirror, but you make sure... you tell him. Or else that moment is going to pass you by forever. Oh God, you need therapy. You need hypnotherapy! Or martini-therapy or maybe you need a shrink. You've got to get over him. How about spa therapy? That's my girl! On today's 'Maybe Love', let's reminisce on the romantic field of traditional love. Compared to our modern times, if you think about it, do you get the feel... Li-Ann! Mom. Write love letters, don't just listen to them. They're useful for my lessons. Very nice! Good fabric. Are you going out with KS? We're going to Kim's. I'm going out too. Is that so? With who? With Auntie Khoo... and her friends. Mother? I'm too old to think about such things. And you want me to do your hair? So, what do you know about this guy? Don't get cheated. Do not disclose your phone number and address. Have you checked his identity card? My daughter is crazy. Hi Auntie. You look very handsome tonight, KS. Not as beautiful as you. I'm too old. Come in. Where is Li-Ann? She's getting ready. I will be thrill to have you as my son-in-law. This... is really not up me auntie. KS, don't get me wrong. But you visit my Li-Ann so often that everybody thinks the two of you are going steady. You think I am the reason that no one dates her? Believe me, auntie, I'm not the one to blame. I know. Perhaps Two of you shouldn't see each other so much. Why? What do you mean? Silly boy! "Absence makes the heart grow fonder" She's my daughter, I wouldn't point you the wrong way. What are the two of you chatting about? Girl, you look so pretty. Thank you, mom. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Thank you KS, they're beautiful. Come, I'll put them in your room. You're more beautiful. Some dreams are not meant to be chased. I hope Cinderella doesn't disappear on the stroke at eight this time. It's by the stroke of eight. By the stroke of eight. And anyway... Why would I want to disappear with such a handsome man by my side? Right? Are you ready to go? Yes. Thank you. Hi. Hi! How are you? What a waste! But I have to admit, KS dressed like that... Actually you know what, I'm sure he stole that suit from a dead businessman. Too bad they don't hook up. They seem tailor-made for each other. Li-Ann! Hey! Wow! Very impressive! Very Nice! Very good! Oh, look darling the girls are here! Hey, death becomes you! CEO had a heart attack? At least he has a heart. Oh! He has a brain. Stop it the two of you. Isn't it time you become friends? Yeah, maybe next leap year. Or never. Oh, never say never. Godma, Godma! Hey Lynette! How are you sweetheart? Godma, a birthday present! Rosie gave it to me. Blow, blow! Godma, you're sleeping! I was, wasn't I? Aren't I silly? There you are! Hi Kim! Your surprise gift has just arrived. No. You told me you had great expectations for your birthday. He is hot, he is smart and he is very, very rich. Li-Ann? What's wrong? Why do you care? Nothing, just that crying makes you look human. I just got dumped. He's just saved himself. I'm sorry... I'm such a mess, I'm sorry. Raymond? Li-Ann, this is Danny's very good friend, Raymond. How are you? Hi, how are you? Now, can I trust you alone with my friend for a while? I'm just gonna check on dinner. Kim's been telling me all about you. Nice things I hope. Oh yes, quite nice. I was curious to meet you. My celibacy's sort of an issue with my friends. They've launched this publicity propaganda that even the PAP would envy. Well, it's not actually propaganda if they actually deliver the goods. Did they tell you I have a drinking problem? I'm a scotch amateur myself. That I make pig squeals at night? I use earplugs every night. That I'm trying to be gay, but my religion forbids me? Nobody's perfect. You're kidding. Only after dinner. Raymond, you're very nice. But trust me, you don't want to waste your time with someone like me. I'm a rotten peanut. Lost cause. Excuse me. Hey, where do you think you're going? Look, you do what you have to do. Otherwise, you'll never be sure. Jennie Is this insane? Remember how troubled I was when I found out I was gay? You told me, you don't need anyone's approval to love someone. So why bother what other people think? Go, now. I love you. You do? It's about time! I love you too. Now, go! I think we've been here before I recognize this place I've seen the mark of confusion wipe out A single sign of grace Stupid promise. He forgot as soon as he got on that plane. Not when the stakes are so high So before we circle round once more I'm gonna lay down Lay down my pride Li-Ann? Jeremy? I'm sorry you're here. It's okay. I'm sorry KS. I'm so sorry. Everything is going to be okay. You're so good to me, KS. You want me to take you home? Yes. I'm sorry, I'm late. The flight was horribly delayed. Jeremy... Good evening. This is KS. Are you staying? Time for me to wake up. Did I interrupt something? He seemed pretty upset. Is he your boyfriend? Could you give me a minute? KS? Please leave a message after the tone. KS, please don't be mad, okay? Listen. I have to sort things out with him once and for all. Please understand. Call me back, okay? Why did you come back? I wanted to see you again. How did you know I'd be here? I... I don't know. I guess I just know? I've had this on me forever. A saint once decreed that a man must agree to a woman's proposal today. This would always make me smile. How much time have you got? Another 2 hours? No, my flight's tomorrow. Actually, I've got a couple of hours to kill. So, would you trust an almost-stranger and spend the evening with me? So where shall we go? Wherever makes you happy. Weddings. Weddings make me happy. May I have this dance? I love you. Li-Ann? There's something you need to know. I said no private lives. I have a daughter. Her name is Dyllan. She is 3 years old. I have to go back. Listen to me, I don't know what I'm doing any more. My life. It's complicated. Why are you telling me this? I don't know. I wanted to talk to you so many times about these feelings I have. I was dying everyday. I wanted February 29th to come so that I could come back. Please, stop! I thought I could do this, but I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. No, I'm sorry. You know, I wanted tonight for myself. I thought, what if it never happens again? You know I wanted tonight to be my own fairytale. I wanted a beautiful memory. You are everything I've dreamed of, and everything that is wrong. I'm sorry to have come between you... ...and your family. There's... there's something you need to know. Bye, Jeremy. I ran away from a dinner party, and came back the next morning a third party. Pretty much nothing changed, really... But everything had already changed. I have loved and lost, all within a day. Li-Ann, I think I'm a fool. I have waited for you for many years, hoping you will feel the same way for me. Tonight I saw you chasing after your dream, just like how I am chasing after you. For the first time, you are like a mirror for me. Now I see that I am dreaming. I need to wake up. I have decided to go away for a while. Please do not try to look for me. I wish you all the happiness in the world. Happy Birthday. Sincerely, KS. With you in coma, everything has stopped. The wind has stopped. My birthdays have been spent waiting. Today, I am waiting for a miracle. I know, I know... Anyway, it's been really quiet in the house with dad in the hospital. My mom? Well, she's busy with her book launch. And sometimes I think we don't exactly live in the same reality. You know, it's strange how things are so different without dad around. Oh, I've got to go. I'll see you soon? Okay, take care, bye. Dyllan! What did you mean? About what? That we're not in the same reality? I'd listen, but you never want to talk to me. You just pull away. Me? Pull away? What are you talking about? Why do we need to talk? I just want some time alone. I just tried to give you what you needed. What I need... is just some space. Dyllan and I have drifted apart. She is still in deep shock. She has withdrawn into herself I can't talk to her. We go through each day putting up a normal face, hoping our lives will return to our normal past with you. Deep inside, we are both lost without you. I need to find a way to reach out to her, to talk to her, to let her know I am here for her, like I am here for you. In three words, I can sum up everything I've learned about life: It goes on - Robert Frost 3rd Leap Year I continued to measure my life in Leap Days; my February 29s. Each birthday, I never know which way the wind will blow. It's always the best of times, the worst of times; all at the same time. Thank you. Kiss kiss kiss. Kim! Daughter! Yes, I know. Tonight. I won't forget. Okay, bye. Mommy. Come and eat something. You're working too hard. Why do you work so hard? My mom's the best. I love you so much. Who'll take care of you when I not around? I'm going out to get some coffee powder. Finish up your noodles. I clean up for you later Bye. See you! Did you forget something? I forgot to ask for an autograph from the boss. Oh my god, KS! Hey, no hug for an old friend? Oh my god, I missed you so much! Me too! No resentments? Only good memories. Hey, what are your plans for the day? I'm seeing Lynette later this afternoon, then tonight all of us, including you, we're going to go to my favourite restaurant. Are you bringing a date with you? I'm dating my work, which suits me fine. No more Windows Cafe? KS! You're not listening! We're having dinner tonight at seven. No regrets? It's dead, KS. At that time, it hurt so bad that I thought I was going to die. But I didn't. And it only made me stronger. Anyway, what about you? How many broken hearts did you leave all over Europe? I dated some girls... nothing serious. And then... I found her. She was always there but I didn't see it, stubborn as I was, chasing you. We got engaged. You're engaged?! Yes, I'm getting married next year. I've never been so happy in my life. She'll be here really soon to meet you. Do you think she'll get along with this... jealous, possessive friend of yours? If not, I'll kill her, okay? I'm so happy for you KS. I love you, Li-Ann. I always will. Are you cheating on me already? Suneetha! You're back! Don't tell me you're back for my birthday too? Sort of. What a coincidence! Now, the two of you, please be nice to each other. To him? I can't stand her. Twerp! Snake! Hey, come on. Li-Ann, my fiancee. I mean, I couldn't believe it when she told me. I nearly had a heart attack when he told me. Did you feel jealous? It was more like a feeling of loss initially. And then, when I found out it was Suneetha, I was very, very happy. Remember? "Never say never, or you will drink from that fountain". She'd be a walking swimming pool by now. Godma, Mummy, look! Oh, that's beautiful! At least KS is good husband material. How's your divorce coming along? Painful, painful. Danny thinks money can cure any wound. He's out with his bimbos. At least, he's nice to the children... Maybe one day I'll rebuild my life. Of course you will. With a richer one. Yes. So, Jennie has Gretchen, KS has Suneetha, I have my alimony, what about you? I have my book cafe remember? Is it really over? I mean, it's your birthday. Will he be waiting for you? I've already told you, it's over. Which part of 'over' do you not understand? I'm very, very sorry. We still love you. Hey, Kim! Hi Raymond, how are you? See you guys inside. I'm great. Hi! You're as pretty as before. You don't recognize me? No. I met you exactly four years ago at Kim's. You had some unresolved issues - drinking, squealing? You were that obnoxious scotch-lover. And you, that rotten peanut. Nice to meet you. Again. You too. Ma'am, your car's ready. Thank you. Hey guys, see you around. Thank you for dinner. Bye. I just want to run Just want to hide away Close my eyes to your gaze Just want to leave Don't want to hear them say "You're no good at this" When the world swirls with naysayers Broken wings and torn pages The road ahead Swimming in my tears Break me open Tear me down Into pieces Broken crumbs On the ground. You can mould... How dare he come back! In your image Breathe your life You know I need it Scars make us stronger Scars make us stronger For life Li-Ann! Oh, hi! It's you. Ma'am, your cake. Thank you. Bye! Wait! Sorry, were you waiting for me? I am. I thought I made it clear the last time. But, you're here. Oh, that's pure coincidence. My daughter, she loves the chiffon cake here. You have a daughter? Yes. She's two. And, and you're married? Yes. Is it that friend of yours, KS? My best friends remain best friends. There's no confusion about that. Are you happy? Happy as can be. Anyway, it's really nice to see you again. You take care okay? It's funny how these old photos of us look nothing like how I remember the past. In my memory, we look twenty-four, just like the first day we met. Always. Hello? Hello, birthday girl. Kim, Hi! Happy birthday. How's it going with Dyllan? Well, if you consider yelling and her walking out good, then it's going great. Just give it some time. She will come around. Look, call, if you need me. Otherwise I'm taking you out on Friday for the most spectacular post-birthday party you've ever had. Okay. Bye. Dyllan and I are suffering alone. We are together and yet apart. I don't want to repeat the same mistake as I did with you - together apart. Dyllan and I can be stronger if we face this crisis together. I used to read stories to her when she was much younger. Just like mother and daughter. Are you taking the book with you? That's what I was looking for. Open it. You know I've always been so bad at explaining myself, and I think there's something in there that will say a lot. Dear Ms Li-Ann, my mummy used to read this book to me. I don't see her very much anymore. I am old enough to read it myself now but maybe, we can read it together. I know she wouldn't mind. You gave that to me, when you first came with your father. I... I remember. And that was one of the two happiest moments in my life. I'm sorry. A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it. - Jean de La Fontaine 4th Leap Year Why isn't the groom here yet? It's not good if we miss the auspicious time! Touchwood! Hey, KS will make sure that they are on time, don't worry. Auntie, they're here, they're here! They can't get to us! Quick, quick, let's go! The next leap year, Raymond proposed... and I settled. Maybe that's what settling down truly means. Kiss her, kiss her! Kiss her, kiss her, kiss her! Yes? Hey, you're still here! Yes. Kim gave Suneetha a lift. I stayed to pack some video stuff. I do not need three hours to prepare like you girls. Yes, all for the benefit of you guys. What time is Raymond picking you up? Five-thirty? Six? The JP will solemnize us at seven-thirty, before the dinner. Yes? Ask, before you explode. Are you sure about this? I mean, really sure? Isn't it too late to play the jealous lover, KS? Li-Ann I was taping you today. I can see that you are not happy. How did you know Suneetha was the one? It was not any one thing. More of a feeling... A joy when I see her, a warmth when I touch her. And she made me forget you. Does Raymond make you forget him? KS! Why are you doing this to me? Today is my wedding day, for God's sake! I'm sorry, Li-Ann. I'm really sorry I just don't want you to make a mistake. KS, I really need your help to see me through this ok? Are you all right? Raymond? Why me? Hey, we've been through this before. Come on, we'll be late. Why are we taking this route? Well, the town's all jammed up. This will get us to the hotel quicker. Li-Ann? Are you all right? I'm sorry. I just needed some air. Hey, stop the car! What? Why? I have to do something, you go ahead. I'll meet you at the hotel. The ceremony starts at seven-thirty, you'll never make it in time. Just try to make them wait, okay? Trust me. It's, it's going to rain! Just want to leave Don't want to hear them say "You're no good at this" When the world swirls with naysayers Broken wings and torn pages The road ahead Swimming in my tears Break me open Tear me down Into pieces Broken crumbs On the ground You can mould and shape me In your image We have to start now, we're very behind schedule. Okay. No. I mean, I think we should wait. Just... a little while. Why? Auspicious minute? Mic test, mic test. Ladies and Gentlemen, please rise to welcome Raymond and beautiful Li-Ann! I'm not sure how KS managed it. He probably gave the DJ a hundred dollars or something. But as I was walking down the aisle he actually read this, through the microphone. I showed our daughter the love letter you wrote me years ago. The only one that reached me and broke through the silence. The one that brought us back to our path of destiny. It's the hospital... We have to go. Dear Li-Ann, I have dreamt that one day I would meet a girl who would change my life. I never thought this dream could come true. When I saw you for the first time, I felt a change. I have never felt this way with anyone. I wanted my life to mean something more, I wanted to be happier. But I was already engaged and Florence was very ill. It was my duty as a man to stay with her. I needed to forget you. I also wanted you to move on with your life. I was a torn apart. Nothing made sense. My promise to meet you on 29th February grew into an obsession. An obsession to see you, to find out more about you. I started to live for this promise. Then, Florence passed away. I was a single parent but then you told me you were married. Are you really married? I cannot forget you said you loved me. Every time I saw you, my feelings grew stronger. I felt we were so right for one another, but everything seemed so wrong. You once told me the most common word in love letters is 'miss', not 'love'. I finally understood. You said that if I were to write my wish on a sheet of paper and let it fly, it could come true. Since Florence died, I have been writing you love letters, telling you how much I feel we belong together. Today is 29th February... I dedicate all my letters to you. The wish that we can be together in this lifetime. I hope against hope the wind will bring us together. Whatever way the wind blows, I will be at the same place, same time, waiting for you. Today and every February 29th. I love you. Yours always. Jeremy. Go. Before I change my mind. I'm sorry. And they lived forever after Is this the way Our story goes But this I know No matter come what may Forever starts today Heaven knows this love is real Goes beyond white lace and veil I must be mad My heart is finally free and yet Will this be the day I find the seal on my heart Finally, I realized I have waited away my life for an answer you have already given me. 12 years ago when we first met. I know it now. You were like the wind and I needed to be patient. I must be mad My heart is finally free and yet A saint once decreed that a man must agree to a woman's proposal today. So show me a sign, as I'm hidden from your eyes if you will have me, for the rest of your life and forever end the tradition of February 29th. If you are not too long I will wait here for you all my life. Oscar Wilde We meet every February 29th. Same time, same place. Once upon a time, I have loved and lost, and yet I have found you. Now once again, I am close to losing you. You promised we will meet again on February 29th. Let the wind blow again. OK?
