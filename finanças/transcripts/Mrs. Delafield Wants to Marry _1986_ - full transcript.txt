[MUSIC PLAYING] [SIREN] Gladys. What is it? Are you feeling all right, George? Of course I am. What do you want? Delafield? Next door. [MUSIC PLAYING] Follow me. Get the picture. -What picture? Of Mr. Delafield. And bring the lace pillow. She'll want that. Yes, ma'am. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, up. They're taking Margaret. [MUSIC PLAYING] Horton, Horton? Memorial hospital, George. [MUSIC PLAYING] -She's not-- -No, no, no, but she's worse. GEORGE (VOICEOVER): It all began at that moment, the whole shocking business. We were prepared for the worst. But sometimes the worst isn't what you think it is. We held a vigil in the hospital waiting room. Horton, Margaret's eldest, a pompous boob in my estimation. I really should be at the office. GEORGE (VOICEOVER): --and her daughter Sarah. Sarah has a slight drinking problem. The thing I hate about hospitals is they don't have bars. GEORGE (VOICEOVER): Sarah is the veteran of three marriages, the last one always the worst. Chipper, Margaret's youngest, has made up for it by never marrying. Sarah, how's mother? She's sinking. -Oh god. -Hello, George. Chipper. What can we do? Nothing but wait. You didn't, uh, bring a flask of anything by any chance? [HEART MONITOR BEEPING] You can live, Margaret. You have to live. And you can. You can live. Uh, Doreen and I will move into mother's house, of course. Doreen's practically packed. She's been packed for years. Take it. But I want the house by the lake, Horton. What do you want, Chipper, in the real estate line? Isn't this a bit premature? Well, these things have to be decided, Chipper, no matter how painful they may be. Gladys has to keep reminding me that we are very fond of the Delafield's children. [SIGHS] Doctor, I don't think you know my brother chipper. Dr. Elias. How do you do? How do you do? And our good neighbor, Mr. Parker. Hello. Well? Well, I, I'm sorry, I can't offer much hope. If you'd like to go in and see her, please do so one at a time. Oh god. Oh, I wish I had a drink. Horton, you go first. I'll get last, of course. Those people are so emotional. Aren't they? -You mean doctors? -Of course. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, when I think of all the good times you and Spud, before that terrible disease took him. I wish you could hear me because I wanted to say how much I've always admired you. You're Chippendale, Margaret. You've carried the flag of privilege. You've lived high, lived by the rules. You've had a perfect life, dear Margaret. And I know you're going to have a perfect death. Well-- Thank you for coming. I know what it means to her. Not at all. Not at all. FEMALE VOICE (ON LOUDSPEAKER): Dr. Shale, Doctor. FEMALE VOICE (ON LOUDSPEAKER): Please call the page operator. Oh, excuse me. Dr. Oscar Shale, call the page operator. GEORGE (VOICEOVER): Good god, I thought. If he reacts like that to every patient he loses, it's a wonder to me the man can still function. [MUSIC PLAYING] Lynn. Lynn. You better get the doctor. Excuse me, Mr. Carter. I'm afraid we have to see your chest. Doctor. Here we are. Fred, would you take over, please? Excuse me, I uh, have my patient. [MUSIC PLAYING] What have you got? Margaret, can you open your eyes? A little wider. All right, that's it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yahoo, wonderful. [PHONE RINGS] Oh, I'll get that, Janice. Hello. HORTON (ON PHONE): Doreen, It's me. Unpack. A miracle is what it is, Miss Fry. A miracle of God. A little more salad, Mrs. Kelly. Oh, no thank you. I'd burst. Oh surely not on salad. Is it today she comes home? This afternoon. We are going over later. I've never been so relieved. What would we have done without Margaret? The Philharmonic, the garden club, the library fair. Ashmore wouldn't have been the same. Change is the enemy. Exactly. Now we've got something pretty wonderful here. We mustn't lower our standards. Exactly. And to my mind, Margaret symbolizes all that, Margaret and Spud, when he was alive, of course. They were the perfect couple. The perfect marriage. Perfect, meant to be. Oh, look at that, old Billy taking flowers into the house. Isn't that touching? do you know, he's been with the family all his life. Listen everybody, have whatever you'd like drink now. But we'll save the champagne until mother gets here. Oh, good. Lucille, you and Marie will join us, I hope. -Oh, thank you. -Thank you, Sirs. Here come old George and Gladys. Oh, lord, who invited there? Well, George, Gladys, good, good, good. Your mother telephoned us from hospital and asked us to come. Well of course, it wouldn't be family without you two. Am I too dressed up? I just couldn't help it. It's such an event. You look just lovely, Gladys. You look just lovely, Gladys. Oh thank you, Coreen. We're just so excited. -Hi ya, George. -Chipper. Hi, Gladys. Hello, Chipper, dear. What a great day, Chipper. Yep, old Mom's coming home. You enjoy living in New York City? Yeah, I eat it up. You know, we went once. And we turned right round and came back again. It was like home. Well, put her there, George. Well, Harrison. Where's Sarah? Oh, I guess she's gone to the bathroom. She goes to the bathroom more than anyone I ever knew. She's highly strung. Say, George, this will interest you. Do you know that vacant lot over on Morton Street? I know it's just a bunch of weeds right now. But it occurred to me that that would be an ideal place for a car wash. GEORGE (VOICEOVER): Sarah's current husband, in real estate, has the mistaken idea that I am fascinated by every detail of every deal he makes. [WHISTLING THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER] Digby, sprung from the loins of Horton and Doreen. You know, Digby, you really ought to pump a little iron. You're nothing but flab. -So what? Flab is in, Uncle Chipper. Don't call me Uncle. And name one place where flab is in. Philadelphia. You might be right. [CHATTER] -Are you June or are you Jane? -June. Oh, hello, Jane. Hi, Mrs. Parker. I haven't seen your mother. There she is. Oh. Hello, Gladys. Sarah, dear, aren't you excited? Oh yes, it's driven me to drink. [CHATTER] I wish you wouldn't drink so much, dear. But, Gladys, I have to wash down the pills. That was a tricky deal. You've got to be pretty sharp in real estate these days. Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure. But I think I've been, uh, pretty smart all around. Sarah would agree, I think, that, uh, I've been pretty on the ball. Who is that? She's here. Horton. She's here. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here we are. Look, my whole gang. How wonderful. Hello, hello. Oh, it is good to be home. Horton, hello. We've missed you. Oh, Doreen, what a welcome. Hello, Chipper darling. Welcome home, Toots. Hello, Harrison. How's the real estate biz? On the upswing, Margaret. Good, I should hate for anything to go down hill while I was-- Sarah, how lovely you look Oh, Mother. Having a little nip? Julie, Jane, how I've missed you. Hello, Digby. Hi, Grandma. How are you? Still whistling? Gladys, dear, oh. And dear George. How good it is, Margaret. I think you all know Dr. Elias. Lucille, Marie. -Welcome home, Mrs. Delafield. -Thank you. Mother look, it's old Billy. Hello, Billy. Come in and have a glass of champagne with us. Billy. The doctor is staying to have a drink with us. Of course, of course. I hope you'll think the house is all right, Mrs. Delafield. We tried so hard to keep everything to your liking. Oh doctor, do you have, uh, other patients here in Ashmore? No, I don't. Really, How did mother find you? Yellow pages, I guess. Isn't it thrilling what one can find in the yellow pages? Isn't it? There's more there than meets the eye. What you talking about, George? This doctor. You don't mean? Well, I wouldn't be surprised. That's not possible. Why not? Well, isn't he Jewish? [MUSIC PLAYING] Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? Please? I should like to propose a toast. To our dear mother on the happy occasion of her return to home and hearth. [CHATTER] Yow! Thank you, Horton. That's very sweet of you. And, um, I should like to propose a toast. To Dr. Marvin Elias, the good and caring doctor who brought me back. Dr. Elias. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] But we couldn't seem to get it to the finish line. Oh, dear. What we did was, we moved the piano into the kitchen, Mother navigating. Really? Why? It was the only way with all those kids. That way she could cook and give piano lessons at the same time. How extraordinary. Of course, sometimes it got a little messy. She used to keep time with the mixing spoon. We had the only piano in the Bronx that smelled like chicken soup. Would you ask them to stop that or turn it down? Yeah, big guy. Your glass is empty. I'll get it. Oh, Doctor, do you think it would endanger my condition if I would have a second glass? On the contrary, I think it vital to your recovery. Thank you, sir. He's very comforting. Isn't he? Will you turn that down, please. You know better than that. Oh now, tell him. He'll be so pleased. Your flowers are beautiful. Maybe Thursday. What? He's referring to the possibility of rain. Deaf as a post. Can't hear a thing. Rain on Thursday you think, Billy? Oh yup. Is he infallible. Infallible, you can count on Thursday being sunny. Would you like to see the history of me? Very much. Oh, look, here are our drinks. Thank you, darling. Isn't this fun? Come on. Here you are, the entire life of Margaret Delaville Delafield on one screen, gorgeous antique. The screen, I mean. I don't think that's funny. Well? Well what? What did you think of him? The doctor? Very amusing. What was so amusing? Well, he tells jokes. Jokes? Well, not jokes exactly, George, stories, anecdotes, very amusing. Like what? Oh, I don't know. About his mother. Well, what's so funny about his mother? It's the way she brought them up. His father died, and they didn't have a bean, apparently. So she had to bring up six children by giving piano lessons. Well that's simply hilarious. It's the way he told it. Did he mention a Mrs. Elias? Yes. Thank God. They're divorced. Damn. Are you sure this is you? Just before puberty struck, and I turned out to be a girl. It came as quite a shock. Up until then I thought I was a boy. I'm glad puberty struck. So was I, as I recall. It was some time ago. That's my husband and me shooting the rapids in our boat. Which rapids? Oh, who knows? I can't remember, just some rapids somewhere. They were there. So w shot 'em. He was very good looking. He was a darling man. What is he doing in there, examining her? Mother likes him. I wish he'd take her out sometime. The idea of [INAUDIBLE], I think it's so fascinating. Yeah, they organize-- And we have a whole lot-- Mother, come and sit down. You must not tire yourself out. But I'm not the least tired. You've just gotten out of the hospital. Now, Doctor, I don't buy that Yellow Pages bit, you know. Ah, you don't? Now, you must have met Mrs. Delafield socially before becoming her physician. No. Oh, thank you. Oh, no, no, thank you. Then how did you, uh-- Kashinski, he's a patient of mine. We met through him. Oh, Kashinski, that artist fellow. Oh yes, I believe Margaret helps him out, uh, financially or something. Oh, does she? Yes. A remarkable woman, isn't she? Oh, yes, yes she is. She really is the most remarkable-- And so was her husband, Spaulding. Spud we used to call him. They were the first nice people my wife and I met when we came to this country, were Margaret and Spud. Wonderful devotion to each other. Splendid looking, Spud, he was tall, blond. People used to say, people used to say that he put them in mind of a Greek god. Oh, very impressive. Well it was right, you know, their marriage. There must be a photograph of him around here. Oh, I've, I've seen it. Oh. Awesome, which reminds me. Would you excuse me, please. So what's wrong with window display? I'm glad you like window display so much since you are in it. It doesn't seem manly to me. What am I supposed to do, go into meat packing? The doctor didn't leave, did he? I don't think so. Margaret, you know, I always think of Spud when I see this chair. That's because he always sat in it. Did he say he'd be-- oh, I was afraid you'd gone. Would I do a think like that? I want to take a photograph. Oh, no, don't. Please don't . Oh, Margaret , please, just one. Well then everyone, the family. Oh, no, no, no, Margaret, no, just you. You don't mind. Do you? No, come on. Come on. Sit right over here/ I always photograph the patients I save. Don't you save them all? Oh no, I'm very selective. I didn't see why you're making such a fuss. He's only her doctor. You miss things, Gladys. You don't see what I see. -Good. -Grandma looks so pretty. -I know. She looks so good. Why is Digby always whistling? [INAUDIBLE] Well, that doctor was a strange one. What doctor? That funny looking man. Was that her doctor? I thought that was just the man who drover her home. Why couldn't she have gone to old Doc Scott? It is just like her to have a Jewish doctor. -It is just like her to recover. -What? I mean it's just like her to recover. And it's wonderful. --Oh. [WHISTLING] Digby, is that the only tune you know? She was weeks in that hospital with nothing but addlepated nurses. And you know she's always been a man's woman. Spud hardly cold. Oh, George, you make me tired. He's been dead nearly 10 years. It seems only yesterday. Sit down, George. This is the best I can do after all the champagne. In the kitchen? Yes. It's very upsetting. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Is there anything more I can do for you? No, thank you, Marie. Good night. It's so good to have you home. It's so good to be home. [MUSIC PLAYING] GEORGE (VOICEOVER): Since my retirement I am free to spend long leisurely hours indulging myself in such innocent pleasures as the observance of the seasons and bird watching. It was in this manner, and through no curiosity of my own, that I was able to establish a patter as regards the visits of Dr. Elias to Mrs. Delafield. [MUSIC PLAYING] Gladys, Gladys. What do you want, George? Look. Oh, isn't that nice in this day and age? House calls. Three times in one week? Oh, I hope she hasn't got a temperature. MARGARET: (LAUGHING) It's so funny. I don't even believe it. (LAUGHING) It's true. And he saw it? He, he, he saw it. He came into the room and the skeleton was-- (LAUGHING) We sat it in his chair behind the desk in front of the class. And we slapped a yarmulke on the skull. Know what a yarmulke is? Yes, one of those-- And somebody wrote on the blackboard, Dr. Greenberg's class is deadly. And when he saw it, did he laugh? No, he said in view of what was happening in Germany he didn't think a yarmulke on skeleton was funny. Oh, dear. Well, you were young. You didn't know. No, what came later. My, my husband and I traveled a great deal. We were both of inquiring minds. And yet, I wonder sometimes how much we saw. Your glass is empty. I should be getting back to town. Oh no, no. [CHURCH BELL RINGING] George, what are you doing? We've had our dinner. We've had our coffee. It's almost 9:30. GLADYS: And? And he's still there. He stayed for dinner. Well, where will it end. If for dinner, why not for the night? GLADYS: (LAUGHING) Oh, George. I'm going over in the morning and have a talk with her. I'm delighted if you had a good time. Because I enjoyed it too. Oh, such a dinner. Um. Well, we all pitch in, Lucille, Marie, and I. Oh, look at the moon. Well, I, uh, oh, you mustn't catch cold. Oh, well, I won't catch cold. And if I do, I have a good doctor. Good night, Margaret. Oh, oh, well-- Maybe, maybe I shouldn't have done that. It isn't a question of should or shouldn't have. I seem to forget at the moment what it is a question of. You, you give me great pleasure, Dr. Elias. [MUSIC PLAYING] Then we're on the same beam, Mrs. Delafield. Well-- Next time, my place. Meet my kids. Four, you said? Well, two live out of town. Good night, Margaret. Good night, Marvin. [MUSIC PLAYING] Good night, George. [MUSIC PLAYING] Morning, Howard. MARGARET: Morning, George Good morning, Margaret. Come on up. The door's open. Come up. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. Have you had your breakfast? Hours ago. Have some coffee then. Would you bring us some hot? Thank you. Sit down, George. Good morning, Mr. Parker. Morning, Lucille. I must say, reading the newspaper is the most terrible way to start the day. I'm depressed before having even finished my eggs. Did you hear about the Kingsleys? What about the Kingsleys? Their daughter, Debbie, brought home a black man, some sort of a singer dripping with cheap jewelry, and announced that they're planning to marry. Debbie Kingsley? What in the world does he see in her? It put her mother in a wheelchair. I'll give her Dr. Elias' number. He'll have her up in no time. She can dance at the wedding. Margaret, I want to ask you something point blank. And I hope you won't take it amiss. We couldn't help but notice, Gladys and I, [CLEARS THROAT] that Dr. Elias seems to be spending quite a bit of time here. Yes. Are you feeling all right? I been feeling fine, George. As a matter of fact, I'm feeling better really than I have since Spud died. So you and Gladys can put your fears to rest. Thank you, Lucille. We've got to raise more money for the philharmonic, George. I don't understand why music is always so expensive. I have a scheme to hit the banking community with a whole new campaign. Give to music because music gives to you. Margaret, about Dr. Elias. You don't, uh, care for m-- Yes, yes, yes. --music, because-- It is very clever. Thank you. You were saying. Well, I must be frank. Why must you? We're concerned. I mean, you don't feel anything for this man more than just that of patient and doctor, do you? Well, I like him very much. Don't you? Well, I hardly know him. But he seems, uh-- He seem to me to be a fine doctor and a very warm hearted person. Wouldn't you say? Yes, but, uh-- But what? I mean, (STAMMERING) you could never be, I mean, that, you would never consider, uh-- Consider what? I'm only concerned, Margaret, that you might let your, um, your emotions, your tenderer feelings run away with you. I might. I might. But you must think of Spud. Spud would want me to be happy. No, George, I haven't considered it, really. Whatever it is, not until this moment at least. I will confess, however, that where-- whereby, um, emotions are concerned, I'm somewhat surprised. Why? Well there are certain emotions that I thought were forever behind me. After all, I knew an utterly satisfying love with my darling Spud. And now, I, I find emotions of the same order, if not entirely identical, rising as if out of nowhere, as if from the dead. I had no idea they were still there. Or if they were, that they were capable of being resurrected. Isn't that extraordinary? There, how's that for breakfast conversation? But, but, uh-- George, he kissed me last night. He kissed me. Not just a peck on the cheek, a real kiss. I went limp all over. And George, I responded in kind. Somewhere from within Margaret Delafield, a 14-year-old girl materialized and returned his kiss. Look, she must have been inside me all the time. Isn't that remarkable? You know how old I am? Yes, it's, it's very interesting, Margaret. And exciting. Exciting? You don't mean exciting? Yes, yes, exciting. You won't tell anyone, not even Gladys? Gladys? Oh no, no I-- look, will you excuse me, Margaret? I'm very-- You're, you're not ill, are you? No, no, no, I'm not ill. It's just that I, I, um-- Kissing away, was she? Are you all right, George? Kissing away without restriction or shame. -Who? -Well, who do you think? Kissing away without any regard to, to class distinction, or religion, or age, or family, or anything. Margaret and the doctor? I tell you, Gladys, with that kiss, we've taken one giant step towards disaster. Oh, I don't see why. I mean-- For God's sake, Gladys, do you want to live next door to the Elias house? Well, no, but, uh, that doesn't make me anti-Semitic, does it, George? Of course not. Really, Gladys, you should have a better opinion of yourself. [MUSIC PLAYING] Move this, please. Thank you. What are you doing all this for? Because I told Dad I would. I don't see the point. He's bringing home a lady friend. It's just a patient. Well, he's never done it before. Some rich old bitty. She probably smells of camphor. She doesn't look like she smells of camphor. She doesn't look like she smells of gefilet fish either. Ashmore. Ashmore? Oy vey, hide the Manishewitz. Bring out the sherry. I'll bet she asks for Dubonnet. You want to bet? I am too nervous to bet. An Ashmore matron right here in my father's very own thatched hut. Here it is. Oh, my, it is very active. Margaret, this is my son David. Mrs. Delafield. How do you do, David? How do you do again? -How do you do? It's pleasure to meet you. And my daughter Shirley. Hello, Shirley. I love the way you look. Oh, thank you. I, um, sometimes despair. Good bones. Oh, thank you. I'm glad you like them. They're just as God made them. I mean, I don't do anything to, uh-- this is very nice, Marvin. So spare and modern. Thank you. Well, let's all sit down. Yes. I live in a world of clutter. In Ashmore? Yes, do you know of it? I've heard enough. I'm crazy about Ashmore. Those big houses, those leafy maples, I'd love to live there. Wouldn't you, David? I'm sure I couldn't get arrested in Ashmore. Would you want to get arrested in Ashmore? Let's all have a drink. Margaret, what do you say? A glass of sherry for me, I think. I told you. I beg your pardon. Oh, it's, uh, uh, nothing. We were just taking bets on what you'd drink coming from Ashmore. I said Dubonnet. David said sherry. Oh, well, we're not limited to sherry in Ashmore. My daughter, for instance, drinks everything. What would you kids like? SHIRLEY: Oh, we've got ours, Dad, thanks. You're an editor, David. Yes. That must be very interesting. It is. Except that I work for a magazine you've probably never heard of. It's not exactly underground. What is these days? But, um-- -Here we are. In your neck of the woods, I suppose you'd call it subversive. The, uh-- Thank you. --cureent issue, for example, is devoted to Soviet dissidents, Jewish Soviet dissidents. I doubt our circulation is high in Ashmore. I doubt it. We generally prefer magazines about trees. What do you do, Shirley. I'm kind of a glorified social worker. I work in a center for the elderly and indigent. That must be very satisfying. Most of the time. But every once in a while we get a yenta, poor thing. All she does is kvetch. Would you like me to translate? You may have to. Have you seen my mother's book, Mrs. Delafield? Oh, I doubt if she's interested in that. No, no, your mother wrote a book? Oh, yes, didn't Dad tell you? She's a speech pathologist, one of the world's foremost. This is the definitive work on stuttering. Never mind about that. No, no, I think it's t- t- t- terribly interesting. Well, here's to us. L'chaim. L'chaim. What does that mean? To life. To life, nice. And what do you do, Mrs. Delafield? Me? Yes, out there in Ashmore. Well, I-- Well, now, Mrs. Delafield is involved in any number of good works. Aren't you? Nothing much with the indigents though. You're one of Dad's patients, Mrs. Delafield. You might say he snatched me from the jaws of death. You're probably wondering why he bothered. No, uh, I mean, everybody has a right to live no matter what. Thank you. Can we change the subject? We don't want to bore Mrs. Delafield. No, no, I'm not bored. I'm having a fascinating time. Shirley, you cooked an awfully good dinner. Well, I feel as though I have to come around every so often and cook Dad a decent meal. He does eat very well at the hospital. (LAUGHING) Neither do the patients. My mother's a fabulous cook. I suppose you don't cook, Mrs. Delafield. You have someone? Oh, yes, chefs, two actually. One for day and one for night. European, best kind, temperamental, but they seem reasonably content at Ashmore. Must be the leafy maples. You think so? I don't lift a finger. I don't even go downstairs to eat the meals. I have a system of weights and pulleys. Oh, that. Your father thinks it's unsightly. But it's a kind of track. And the food moves along it. And it's pretty, if you decorate it with ribbons. And the food comes right into my bedroom and is dumped into my mouth. Everybody in Ashmore has them. They don't all have ribbons. I mad a fool of myself, a perfect fool. No, you didn't. Why didn't you stop me? Why did you let me go on? Weights and pulleys, and where did those ribbons come from? What was that all about? [INAUDIBLE] I worry about Sarah, three husbands, all that drinking. She doesn't seem to find any joy in life. David is fine really. Got a nice live-in Jewish lady who hangs on his every word. Poor Chipper, I do love him so, but he lives in a world that I can't comprehend. I suppose the best I can do is just always be the when he needs me. The twins seem to be all right. But Digby worries me. What does it mean when someone whistles all the time? He's releasing the wind from his thorax. -His what? -His thorax. Are you serious? Um huh, very. George, what are you doing? They're sitting in the car in front of her house. They're probably just talking. At their age? Come back to bed. 30 years later, we gradually realized we were no longer in love. The children were grown. She wanted a career. So-- I know I'll always love Spud. I don't want to lose that. But now that we know each other, it makes it, oh-- Is something wrong? No, no, nothing. Seems as though I'd lost you there. No, no, you haven't lost me. I'm not lost. Maybe I'm assuming too much. No, please, assume. Assume. I don't want our relationship to cause you any pain. It's no our relationship, darling. It's my hip. It slips out of joint sometimes. -I know what to do. -Do you? -I can fix it. -Can you? -Shall I? -Will you? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, -OK all right. Oh, it's so painful. [INAUDIBLE] Yes. -Just lie down. -OK. There you are. Easy. MARGARET: Oh, god. -Oh. -Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. What are they doing? Well, if that's sex, Gladys, I'm glad you're past it. Make sure you're all right. I'm sure. Well, I'm just concerned that it may not be seated properly. No, I'm fine. It goes in and out of joint. Now look, there it is. I works. That what matters. With me it's the shoulder. Oh dear. Marvin, I think maybe we're beyond the point of sitting in automobiles and making, uh, making-- --love. Was that what it was? Wasn't it? It's fun. Isn't it, Marvin? No wonder everyone does it. No wonder. Should we try it again, just to make sure? I wouldn't mind it. No, no, you sit down. We have a serious discussion coming up. Now, we have to ask each other a question. The answer is yes. The answer is a number. We have to ask each other how old we are. Darling, you forget I'm your doctor. I'm the man with the chart. Hm, I must say, it's a strange feeling to be courted by a man who knows every inch of me. I feel a distinct disadvantage. You want me to undress? Doctor, you shock me. Marvin, about that chart-- What about it? Isn't it possible that it could be a little inaccurate? About your age? Mm. Not if you told the truth. Oh, well, no, of course, not if I told the truth. You didn't? Well, Marvin, it's so vulgar to be absolutely accurate about a think like that, so unimaginative. You should have told the truth. I might have treated you differently. That's what I was afraid of. Oh, (LAUGHING) all right, break it to me gently. I'll whisper in your ear. Now you. You see. We're perfect for each other. Perfect. [MUSIC PLAYING] I don't believe it. She always comes to the symphony with Doreen and Horton. Oh, Miss Fry, Miss Kelly, how lovely to see you. I don't believe you know Dr. Elias. -How do you do? -Miss Fry, Miss Kelly. How do you do? Your doctor? Well yes, yes, my doctor. We go everywhere together because you never know. We're terrified of a relapse. Terrified. Oh, dear, I feel one coming on. Well, we'd better get you to your seat. Excuse us, ladies. -So sorry. Fake. You mean, you think-- Margaret Delafield is having a fling. We wouldn't have troubled you this morning. I'm sure you'd rather be in church. But it's very serious indeed. It's about mother. She seems to have formed an attachment to this doctor. Yes, we know. It's really serious. The attachment? The situation. I've had a talk with her, but with not very satisfactory results. Oh? She actually, she actually asked me what I thought about her marrying him. -Horton, no Heavens, it's worse than we thought. She can't be serious. She is serious. More coffee. Not for me, thank you. And when I asked her why she would even consider marrying him, she said because she wouldn't live in sin. Oh, Margaret, Margaret. We've got to do something. You've always been so close to her, George, to both her and Dad. You've got to talk to her. But of course, of course I will. But what did you say to her, Horton? Well, I told her she couldn't do that to my father. Quite right. I told her this doctor is not a Christian. It can't have come as much of a surprise to her. I thought she needed reminding. And I told her that it would be unseemly. Unseemly? Well, at her age. Oh, of course. Certainly. Do you know what this could mean? Do you know what it could mean to the estate? Now, dear. But you all have your own money, don't you? I mean, didn't your father leave you-- We're comfortable. That's all, comfortable. Mother's estate is much more impressive. He could end up with everything she's got. Everything that's ours by rights. And what about the children? Hm? Everything that should come to them, he could get it all. What can we do? I'll rally the family. But you and George can help just by pointing out to her how misguided she is. God knows what tricks he's used to get her to this condition. I'm sure he's brainwashed her. And she may be drugged. After all, he has access. Drugged? Do you think so? There may be wider implications, you know. Like what? Pinko. Russian? Where do you think those people came from? Seems awfully affable for a pinko. George, they're picked for that. Well, it's all so difficult, a woman in love. Oh, she isn't in love. She loves my father. You make it sound as if he was merely away on a business trip. Gladys. Love is eternal. Well, we've got to get a move on. Thanks so much for your help, I've got to call Chipper in New York. Sarah's ready to call out the Marines. I'm really not sure about Chipper. He'll want what's best for her. We all want what's best for her. We love mother. What we're trying to do is protect her. Against herself. Lucky to have you. Your house is always so neat. Oh, it's a mess. Gladys will talk to her too. You know, sometimes two women-- Margaret, dear, you just can't do this. Nonsense, I could do it forever. Gardening clears the mind, frees the brain, opens the pores. You know what I mean. You can't marry this man. You just can't Well of course I can't, because he hasn't asked me. But we thought-- I mean Horton led us to believe-- Yes, but that was because I asked Horton what he thought about the idea. I didn't say it was Marvin's idea. Mine, actually. Well, whether he's asked you or not, I'm sure he wants to. Are you? Are you really, Gladys? What makes you think so? Well, look what it would mean to him, what he would gain. What? Well, all this. Yes, but you see, there's a problem. The simple fact is, I'm not Jewish. And I might as well confess to you, dear, I don't think his children quite approve of me. What? Well, you see, their mother is quite a brilliant woman actually. She's written a book. How can I compete with that in their minds. I don't blame them. And Marvin has such integrity. I'm sure he wouldn't dream of marrying anyone his children didn't approve of. Oh, that burns me up. Not approve of you. Oh, now, now, Gladys. Oh, really, Margaret, dear, can't you see. The simple fact is, he's just not our kind. No, he's not. And that's a part of what's so wonderful. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello there. Chipper too? Chipper flew in this afternoon. Oh, poor Margaret. Poor Dr. Elias. Poor Dr. Elias? I'm sure his gang are ecstatic. They just hit pay dirt. Hi, Dad. What's this? Karen. -Hi, Dad. -Hello, Frieda. -Hi, Dad. -Is, uh, is Shirley here? Shirley? No, why? Well, she was supposed to meet us here. What is all this? I was expecting David. But you came all the way-- Sure, we though maybe you needed us. It isn't as if we don't want you to marry. if you were to find a nice respectable compatible man. I always thought that Dr. Elias was a nice respectable man. And he seems compatible. You're not thinking clearly, someone from Ashmore, a widower, maybe a retired banker. Mother, darling, isn't he younger than you are? Well, yes, a little, but so far we've had no difficulty with the generation gap. And he can always finish high school later. But believe me, this is not the woman for you. This is not the woman for you. How do you know? You haven't even met her, you and Karen. David gave us a very full and accurate description. We know the type. We know the type. And as a type she may be very nice. David says, an attractive looking woman. Good bone structure. Good bone structure. Right. But is good bone structure enough? And after that what are you left with? A type, and not your type. I love her. Dad you can't know that. There's no definition for love. Mother, I think you are being unreasonable. It's taking on too many problems. The time in your life when you should be just without problems. You've earned that. That's what we want for your sake, not ours. Aunt Sarah is right, Grandma. You should just take it easy. Whistle something, Digby. Here you are, darling. She comes from an entirely different world. And David says she's older than you are. Oh, what's a few years? A few years could make all the difference later on. You mean when I'm 90 she'll be 95. It looks funny, Dad. It really does. Margaret Delafield is the youngest person I know. Forget years. Look inside. Why are we discussing? Why are we beating around the bush like this? I'd like to meet her. I'm curious, yeah. But I think I have the right to say no to a Goya stepmother from Ashmore. This new doctor, he's just kind of creepy. He's kind of creepy. He is, Granny. He just makes me feel-- He doesn't belong here. David's right. Mom is terrific. Now that is a tough act to follow. Your mother and I were never happy. OK, but that was the right kind of unhappiness. This would be-- Where the hell is Shirley? You don't want to be happy with the wrong people. That could lead to real unhappiness. It's a collision course. You've got so much to lose. All I've got is this wonderful mother and this wonderful father, Who could never love me the way they loved each other. But they were there. And they were mine. And I would just die if-- You don't have to prove anything, Dad. You're an important doctor. You don't need the money, do you? It's not as if you were climbing up out of the ghetto. No matter which way you slice it, she's in the enemy camp. I don't understand that. No matter how pleasant she may seem, there's got to be a feeling there. What is she up to I ask myself. What does she want? Why would she want to mess with us? Just say it. What was the Holocaust all about? Margaret Delafield was not responsible for the Holocaust. What do you want to do, deny your own people? We know who we are. And we are proud. We have the Delafield name. And if you think I'm not aware of the responsibility that that entails, Mother, well I am. How can you throw it all away? It's like, it's like spitting on Dad's grave. I'm sick of this whole argument. And I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of you, Mother. [MUSIC PLAYING] Chipper, what do you think? What do you think, my darling? I think it's chancy, love. It's chancy. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Oh, George, George, what am I going to do? Margaret, what's the matter? Are you all right? No, no, George, I'm not. What can I do, Margaret? Did you want me to come over? Oh, yes, I'll let you in at the kitchen door. Please hurry. Has everybody left from my father's apartment, Sam? They're long gone, Miss Elias. Oh, damn. I'm sorry I'm so late. One of my ladies got sick. I couldn't find the nurse. And I had to wait unt-- How are you? Honey, I feel like I was run over by a steamroller. So does Margaret. Oh, good. Dad, I've really thought about it. I've tried to be objective, put myself in your shoes, the whole bit. And I've got just two words to say to you about that lady. What? Grab her. [MUSIC PLAYING] GEORGE (VOICEOVER): The Delafield house was totally dark except for a light up in Chipper's old room. A chill went through me. Be very quiet. We don't want to wake Lucille or Marie. Sit down, George. Help yourself. No, I think we better just leave it here. What happened, Margaret? I can't do it. I can't make so many people unhappy, his children, my children, their children. Everyone is so heated about it. And I do see, George, that it, it isn't fair of me to think only of myself. Marvin agrees. We must think of others. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid so. You know, it isn't just the family. You do have a certain standing in the community, a certain position to maintain. Yes, yes. I love you very much, Margaret. We all do. It is rather terrible. Isn't it? Rather what? A kind of tyranny, because you all love me so much, I must do what you want, bow t your will. You love me. So I'm yours. and must obey. How terrible. I'm beginning to see at this late date, at this very late date, that love has many faces and some of them are terrifying. [CAR APPROACHING AND HORN HONKING] No, stay there, Margaret. I'll go. I'll go. [POUNDING ON DOOR] Please, let me in. Margaret, let me in. Will you? Doctor, what are you-- Margaret. Margaret. Marvin. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, Marvin. Margaret, marry me. The hell with everyone. Oh, god, Margaret, marry me. [MUSIC PLAYING] George, there's a cold lunch there for you. How could you leave at a time like this? Sarah is already here. Horton has just arrived. But no Harrison, no Doreen, very interesting. I know, dear. But it's the Thursday, bridge club. Good bye, dear. Fill me in later. -Hope so. GEORGE (VOICEOVER): Once I was dressed I wandered over to the Delafield house out of common courtesy and to see that Margaret was all right. Well, it would have been rude not to do so. Come in, George. I don't want to intrude if it's family. It appears to involve the entire neighborhood. Sit down, George. There's coffee there. Or would you prefer something stronger? Nothing for me, thank you. I just came to see how you were I'm fine, George. And I'm getting married to Marvin. Yes, well, yes, you said last night that-- Despite the objections of my family, and I might add, his. Mother, if you would only listen to reason. You've had your say. Let me have mine. Mother, you really ought to have some consideration for us. Sarah, darling, how many husbands have you had? Oh, I don't see what that has to do with-- The number, please. You know perfectly well, three. That is correct, three. And did you have any consideration for your father and me when you ditched Sandy, a perfectly good husband, and ran off with that ski bum? He was the father of my children. Yes, that and going down slopes was the extent of his usefulness. And as for Harrison-- What's wrong with Harrison? He's a buffoon. That's what's wrong with Harrison. Well, she was trying to find happiness. She had to have her chance. And I don't? Youth must be served. But youth doesn't give a damn about age. The young, George, seem to feel that they have a God given right to happiness. While the old are supposed to be quiet, stay out of the way, and not cause trouble. Darling, please understand, that all we want-- And as for you, Chipper, you, who came i here two years ago with Orville in tow, Orville, a garage mechanic. And had the gall to sit him down here on this sofa in his greasy jeans and tell me that you were going to set up housekeeping together. Not set up housekeeping, live together. Same thing. And he wasn't really a garage mechanic. That was just sort of make believe. He worked in a flower shop. And what did I tell you at the time? I don't remember. I do. I took a long look at your Orville and a deep breath. And I said to you, I love you and good luck. By the way, whatever happened to Orville? He wasn't sincere. I'm not surprised. Mechanics who work in flower shops seldom are. Then what about me? I suppose you're going to say I shouldn't have married Doreen. On the contrary, I, I think Doreen was about as good as you were ever going to be able to get. (UNDER HIS BREATH) Oh, Jesus. Now, Marvin and I have finally decided that we have as much right to happiness as you do. And we expect to have your love and support. And I want a big church wedding. And you, Horton, will give me away. I couldn't. I just couldn't. I couldn't do that to my father. I'm not some Indian widow, Horton, to be thrown on my husband's pyre. I have to go on living. Not with this Jew. I will no have that in this house. I'm sorry, Horton, but I mean it. God knows, I don't want to do battle with prejudice at my time of life. But If I have to, I will. Please try and understand this. It's been 10 years since your father died. During those 10 years I've had to face the loneliness as cheerfully and as productively as I could. I tried not to bore people with my sorrow. I tried not to dwell on the past. I tried to pretend that life had some meaning. Although in my heart, I felt it was over really. I was as dead as my husband. And then, when I became ill and thought I was dying, I said, well, that's that. That's the end of Margaret Delafield. But then, when I began to get well again, I saw it as, as a revelation. I gradually came to realize that it's never the end until it is the end. I, I had been spared. And there must have been a reason. My life wasn't over. It was not complete. And then, when I was back in the world again there was-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There was Dr. Marvin Elias, loving me and wanting us to start a new life together. It was, it was like a shining gift. I could love this dear man, not because I've loved your father less, but because I had your father's abiding love as a kind of beacon before me. I could love Marvin because I had loved Spud so much. Right on, Toots. Mother, what about the religious differences? Oh, we've resolved that. How? Will he convert? -Convert? No, no need to convert. I turned to him one day, and I said, do you believe in and he said yes. Do you? And I said yes. And that was it. There are no religious differences, because, because it's all one miracle. Isn't it? And if it's all of one miracle, then it's all one religion no matter how many forms it takes. The sad fact is, Mother, he's only after your money. Our money. The sad fact is that you children seem to be more worried about the money than you are about me. You won't lose by this transaction. I assure you. What I have is Marvin's. What Marvin has is mine. We're old fashioned. The wills will remain the same. We don't know how much time we have left, Marvin and I. But we propose to make the most of every moment. And we will not let anyone stop us. Is that clear? Horton? Sarah? Chipper? George? [MUSIC PLAYING] GEORGE (VOICEOVER): Why she should have included me in her little list of prostestees, I couldn't imagine. Once Margaret makes up her mind, she moves quickly. The very next day she went off to deliver the glad tidings to our minister. I'm planning to be married. Oh, Mrs. Delafield, what good news. Isn't it? And I naturally wish to be married in this church. Of course. Then you agree to that? Oh, of course. Who is the lucky man? Marvin Elias. Marvin Elias? Uh huh. I seem to know the name. A doctor, isn't he Yes. Oh, yes, a splendid man, Dr. Elias. But isn't he, uh-- Yes, yes he is. Yes, well, uh, let me see. Oh dear, we are very heavily booked. Well, Dr. Elias, good to see you again. Rabbi, I know I've been kind of a stranger around here. But when you get married, and my fiance would like a large wedding, you know, with all the proper religious-- Of course, doctor, in God's temple. And may I say congratulations. Thank you. And who is the lucky woman? Oh, Wait. I bet I can guess, the widow Goldman. Hm? No, her name is Margaret Delafield. Delafield? Uh, Delafield. Mrs. Spaulding Delafield on the board of the philharmonic, Leggett Road, Ashmore? Yes, may we use the synagogue? I wish it were possible. What's wrong with the widow Goldman? Hm? GEORGE (VOICEOVER): In the end, they settled for one of those out-of-the-way churches that don't care who they marry. a map accompanied the invitations. We could hardly wait. Oh, Delafield, what's this I hear, your mother is remarrying? Yes, yes she is. Who to? He's a prominent physician. Hm, what's his name? He's a very prominent physician. Somebody said your father is getting married again. Yeah, that's right. Who's he marrying? Uh, a very nice woman, her name's Delafield. Delafield? Where's she from? Ashmore. [DOORBELL] [KNOCK ON DOOR] -Hi. -Margaret, I wasn't expecting-- No. What a lovely surprise. Something to drink? Nothing, nothing, nothing, I came because my feet are cold. -What? -I've got cold feet. All of a sudden I'm scared. Made my big decision, made by big speech, felt wonderful, loved, ready for a new life. Now I'm scared. Come on. Let's sit down. All of the sudden scared. I don't know who I am. I don't know who are you are. Scared. You're a day late. What? Hit me yesterday at the hospital. All of a sudden, in the middle of a busy day, closed my office door, sat behind the desk and shook. I was Marvin Elias, head physician, ex-husband of Edna Freeman Elias. I was successful, reasonably content, set in my ways. It was all just fine. When did you stop shaking, Marvin? I think it was along about the cocktail hour. Came home, started to pour myself a stiff drink, didn't drink it. Spent the next few minutes staring at my little photograph over there. And I decided there was something more important to me than Dr. Marvin Elias, even more important than my work, which is important. What? Your needing me. I happen to know that the elegant Mrs. Delafield, the strong remarkable Mrs. Delafield, I know that she needs to be held in arms a little stronger than hers, to be kissed with a certain regularity, to be told, not that she is remarkable, but she's loved. [MUSIC PLAYING] Are you hungry? I'm ravenous. Let's go out to some terrific restaurant. Oh no, no. We'll get a-- come on. No, no, no, no, let's just stay here, just us two. Have you got any food? Five eggs. Would you settle for an omelet? I'll help. What do you need? Eggs, milk, whatever. They're all here. Bowl. Bowl, heat the dishes. Rice. Knife. There you go. Careful. All right, dishes. Say, Margaret. Hmm? Shall I invite Edna to the wedding? Who is Edna? Edna, my former wife. Oh, yes, of course, if Spud were alive I wouldn't dream of not asking him. Martin? -Hm. I have to ask you something too. I promised Spud that I would never ever take off his wedding ring. Yes. Do you think, possibly, I could keep it on? You mean after we're married? You know, just slip yours on over it. Well, it's all right with me. But isn't that bigamy? You wouldn't be hurt? No, I'd respect it. I'd do for you, Dr. Elias. I adore you, Mrs. Delafield. Now, Marvin, if we're really going through it, if you insist on marrying me, then we'll have to face the facts. We've got to figure out the ceremony. I don't care what we do. But I don't want "The Wedding March." You don't? No. When you come down that aisle, I want to hear "When the Saints Come Marching In." Are you serious? -I'm serious. -Marvin. Hm? Marvin, I have a wonderful idea. Listen, we've got God that darling a little church anyway. Why don't we do. whatever we want to do? Why don't we pull out all the stops, just ask everybody, shake them up? After all, this may be my last wedding. Oh really? I'm just getting into the habit. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHOIR SINGING IN LATIN] Are we Catholic now? (SINGING) Jesus loves me. This I know. For the Bible tells me so. Little ones to him belong. They are weak but he is strong. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so. [CHATTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] Your Honor, I want to read this after the ceremony. We wrote it last night. [MUSIC - "THE WEDDING MARCH"] [MUSIC PLAYING- "WHEN THE SAINTS COME MARCHING IN"] I now pronounce you man and wife. Mazel tov. Mazel tov. [MUSIC PLAYING] So long as there is love, there is no parting. So long as there is love, there can be no death. So long as there is love, we know no twilight. We ask you, Margaret and I, to join us, all of you, of whatever age, creed, or color, put out your hand and touch that of the person next to you. Touch his hand and celebrate with us the joy of life on this astonishing earth. [MUSIC PLAYING] Such a beautiful wedding, so unusual Yes, quite unique. Such a comfort to have a doctor in the home. -Yes. -In case you get sick again. Yes. [COUGHS] Oh, oh, steady, steady, darling. I'll get her into bed soon. You know, it's a strange thing seeing Margaret come down the aisle, watching the two of them, their faces. A curious thought struck me. I, I don't know what I would do without you, Gladys, despite everything. I'm happy for you. I'm glad you are. I liked you wedding. Well, I've liked a couple of yours. Ginger ale. I don't know if I can make it or not, but I am so sick of being a drunk. Are you, darling? I want to try to live without it. And I mean it this time. If you really really want it, you can do anything. [MUSIC PLAYING] Good bye! [CHEERS AND WHISTLES] [MUSIC PLAYING] Card from Margaret and Marvin, palm trees on it. Why would they go to Hawaii for their honeymoon? Nobody from Ashmore goes to Hawaii. What do they say? Having wonderful time. Glad you're not here. [MUSIC PLAYING] MARGARET: Isn't life delicious? [MUSIC PLAYING]
