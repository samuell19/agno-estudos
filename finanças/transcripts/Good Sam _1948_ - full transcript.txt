My dear people, each of us feels that the world is in a terrible mess. It can't be worse than it was, or so it seems. And after all, our world is like us! We never lack plans to make it more dignified and better. But we lack good people capable of their execution. One should never relax in the pursuit of a better world! The greatest and most grateful contribution and effort who could do in that regard ... is that we become people donors. We need more people whose lives are motivated by the mercy of which St. Paul spoke long ago. Those who suffer, who never think of evil. Those who will endure and endure all. According to St. Paul, love is the supreme virtue Buddha, Muhammad, Confucius, Moses and Jesus of Nazareth agree ... that the golden rule is to do to others what what would you do to yourself, an essential prerequisite for the happiness of the individual, and of our society. All good people they found gold in this golden rule! Amen! Mom, this lady is sleeping. Seen! One more time, and you'll get slapped. Turn forward and listen. Come on. Behave politely. Mr. Clayton, one of our collectors got sick? Wouldn't you mind replacing it? - No, not at all. Where are you going? They want me to help them collect donations. But you're too big to beg. Besides, you're so clumsy! Where's Dad going? He's going to collect donations. Where's Dad? He went to collect donations. That's going to be great! That was Dad! Of course. Who else? Good morning, Mr. Clayton. Hello, neighbors, are you going to the snow? That is nice. Where are you going? Nowhere. The car broke down. Oh that's bad. I'm sorry, Mrs. Butler. And the children had the illusion ... My only day off of the week. Now I don't know what to do with all this food. Why don't you people take us to that place and enjoy it a little? No Thanks. You're welcome, Mrs. Clayton. I have a solution. It's very simple. Take our car. Thank you, Mrs. Clayton. - It's nothing. Thank you, Mr. Clayton. Thank you. That's a great idea. They are so happy. Oh, Mr. Clayton. Would you please call Nelson's garage? You have a number in the phonebook. Tell them to take it and fix it. I'll need it in the morning for work. Nelsonova garaža? - Gives. Of course. Here. Oh, will you clean the windshield, please? Of course. It's fine! Now I can see well. Is everything in the car? I forgot to feed the dog. What's that. Wouldn't you mind making him a little dinner? Not. - Do you have lean meat? He has such a sensitive stomach. Today everything is closed, but ... I have rice with meat. It's easy to digest. Obarenog? - Aha. And maybe a little piece of cheese? Of course. - That'll be fine. Thanks neighbors. This is very generous of you. There should be more people like you, the Claytons. You know. There should be fewer people like Butler. Don't you worry about giving your car to a man who can't see? Well OK. But he wears glasses. Well, maybe he's driving with reading glasses. Good morning Lulu. - Good morning, Dad. Good morning Buè. - Hi, Dad. Do you want Crispy snowflakes? Crispy snowflakes again. You've been eating them for two weeks. If I eat another box, I'll get my Indian suit. Ah ... and what will Lulu get? She will see me in my Indian suit. You told me you were going to give me a little dog for the weekend. Of course, when I get my football. Always the same, Dad. Everything I love he gets. Don't talk with your mouth full. Tell Dad, can you eat something? to get a new house for mom? Alright. You find out what it is and I will eat it. What's so funny? Your son is worried. - Oh, what was that? It's something between us men. Hey! Where's Chloe? She must have missed the bus because it 's nasty on Monday morning, you know ... I am extremely glad. I prefer this cook anyway. Scrambled eggs... and Canadian bacon ... his fame. You are so talented. You just say that. Please, Mr. Clayton, my brothers will come down at any moment. He won't. I went to call him and he looked dead. Do you think he won't mind if we eat? - How do you please? Mom, what are you and Dad doing? Nita! I am coming now. An old bulldozer arrives. Smart kids. Good morning, Claude. Good morning. Didn't you sleep? No. Bad night. Ready? Here's breakfast. Well, here's your ... and ... this one is yours. When you were in the Navy, did you have breakfast in bed? Gives! The Admiral would bring me a tray. Claude, if I don't ask much of you, you are a guest in the house. Not for long! I don't think it's 6 months long, but at least while you're here cooperate, and eat when we eat. Couldn't you get up a little earlier this morning? Why? The labor office does not open until 10. Yes, the government hasn't sent checks to the house yet, so the city is full of people waiting in line. Not. Does the government know about this? I have to write to our senator about it. Nice way to talk to your brother. Oh, forgive me, Claude. I didn't know what to say. I spent the whole morning by the hot stove. It's almost like on the edge. Uncle Claude? Are you an idiot? Yeah. Someone said something? You two get ready for school now. Yes. Dress well. Come on. You won't laugh when I get rich! Most likely, we won't. Lou, are you going to the funeral? Whose funeral? Oh Lu. Poor Harry Gilmore. I'm sorry to hear that. But I didn't know Henry Gilmore. Harry. Is that the man who borrowed $ 180 from the bank ? and you guaranteed a return? Yes, poor Harry. Did he leave his widow anything ...? He was not ill for long. That is very sad. He must have been a wonderful man But don't you think it's time to re-examine your trust in people? Lou, how can you trust people too much? I know that sounds awful, but people take advantage of you. Previše si space. You always told me how you see me and you by our fireplace. With this $ 180, you could make a pretty good fireplace. And we can't get them anymore. Euj, Lu. Ne žalim ništa. Harry Gilmore was a nice man. He needed the money, and I gave it to him. Of course. Everyone knew Harry Gilmore well. Tell me one bad thing about Harry Gilmore? His health! Hey, she got something. Can we have coffee before you two fight? Who could it be? Claude, do you mind? No, not at all. Go. Oh, the phone. Claude ...? I will. Halo. Yes, I accept that invitation ... Halo? Hi, Mr. Butler. How are you? And your wife and children? Yeah. And what about our car? Ah, great. ta? Oh, you stay another day. Oh, it's okay, Mr. Butler. Our children go to school. We'll figure out how. Oh, no, never mind ... Sam has to go to work. It is OK. ta? To feed the dog. Again? Yeah. And nothing greasy. Oh yes, I'll balance his diet carefully. Well, have a good time! Say hello to everyone. Lou, this is Mr. Nelson, the mechanic. Hello, Mr. Nelson! He'll have coffee with us. Gives? Sit here, Mr. Nelson. Take this. And a box of snowflakes, please. Thanks. Sam, what is Mr. Nelson doing here? He fixed Butler's car. The carburetor had to be changed. - Don't you? Butler's account. Coffee. - Oh, sorry. - Oh yeah. Here you go. You see, Mrs. Clayton, I run my business on a cash basis. For me, cash is the law, if I trusted people, I would starve to death. They would be surprised how many people don't pay. Oh no, I wouldn't. Everything is dead in this world, everything is worthless, there are no good ... Do you know my brother Claude? Nice to meet you. - Also. Do you think what I said is exaggerated? - No, not much. There are two sides to everything, including my cheeks to be shaved. He's just my half-brother. This is nice. As I told you, Mr. Clayton, you asked for my services, you have to pay. But it's not our car, why would he pay the bill? Butler has been our neighbor for a long time. You can trust him. He will pay. If you trust him so much, pay me, and he will pay you, or I will return the car. Oh? Well, I'll give you the money. 5, 10, 15... Oh, Sam, I forgot to tell you. They called the Butlers. He won't return the car. They decided to stay another day. The weather is so beautiful! 60, 70. Are they, huh? 80, 50, 75. Do you have money, Lou? No I do not have. I expect to get a job. Do you want to take money for food from your children? Oh, Lu. This will be enough. He said that was enough. Well, we're really in trouble right now. The children will have to walk to school and I have to go with them. It's only six blocks. - And six back. And how are you going to get to work? You could use Batle's car, what do you think? Well, I wouldn't want to use his car without asking him. No, I wouldn't. Well I... It seems to be true what they say, excellent coffee is a sign of an outstanding cook. It certainly is. She made me a very tasty breakfast. It smells absolutely good. Especially on an empty stomach. Haven't you had breakfast yet? Lu. I understand. Mr. Nelson, how about eggs the same way? Well, when you asked me, thank you, ma'am, but no. Have you ever made them on black butter? Not. - When the butter melts throw eggs on it and sprinkle with a little vinegar ... and then ... These are Florentine-style eggs, if you have fresh spinach? No, but we could grow it. No, it won't be necessary, eggs on black butter are perfect. Make them once, and your husband will always look for them. By the way, what she said about growing spinach is very funny. Your wife has a sense of humor. A vaa? No, she has asthma. Terrible. She's not fun at all. I bet you wouldn't have a picnic with her. Ah yes, she often laughs. I'll get you some eggs, Mr. Nelson. You will surely save them for yourself. I don't like watching my wife. I don't know, he looks like a horse's face. Oh Mr. Nelson, he has very beautiful horses. I had one. Great and beautiful. - And my wife is big. His name was Boli. That's funny. It has a small sitting strand, right on top of the head. I'm going to have to start calling her "tent". But I better not do that. I try not to make her laugh because of asthma. If she started laughing , she could suffocate. Sometimes it sounds like a whistle ... and sometimes like a car siren. My wife's grandmother has the same problem. Looks like a horse? No, he just has asthma. Good morning, Mrs. Lou. - Hi, Chloe. I missed the bus. I was waiting for the tram. And that man of mine! There is nothing better than a casino ... Did you have any problems with him this morning? Problem? No, he didn't come home at all. That little fool. He thinks he has found a new Linda Holland. She's so thin ... what she has, I have twice as much. I'll take over Mrs. Lou. Who are we feeding today? Your brother Claude? Oh, no. - Mrs. Lou. Who is that? Mr. Sam asked him to come in? I'm quitting! I give up! He just came for breakfast. Oh. Oh, gospoðo Lu. How does Mr. Sam manage to find all these people? Chloe tries to stop it, but he just loves people. My man also loves people, but far from his door. How does he want eggs? On black butter. No kidding? On black butter? Black butter! I need to see that guy. Good morning, Mr. Clayton. - Good morning, Chloe. Good morning. - Good morning. Remove the eggs after exactly 33 seconds. Lou, his wife has nasty asthma. Is there? Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, she's a mess! If they knew what I was going through ... His wife has asthma. Is it contagious? Lou, what could we do about his wife's asthma? I don't know, Sam, but I'll find out. I will write Joan Hopkis to get me some medical journal. No, no, Lu ... I was thinking about your grandmother's goose fat cure? He helped Bucher a lot. Could you do a little for Mrs. Nelson? Sem. It takes four hours. Today is Monday. Chloe, leave ... I can come back later. No problem. This will certainly reduce the pressure a lot. He can't blow his horn through life . I would bless you if we could cure her ... All right, all right. I'm sold. Come on, kids. It's almost 9. I'll take you. Sam, it would be good if you went too. Quid pro quo, I'll take your kids to school and you to work. Thank you. Did you hear that, Lou? Mr. Nelson will take us in his car. Oh, that's very kind of you, Mr. Nelson. Everything floats on water, I always say. I will return for the ointment. Goodbye little mother. At lunchtime? - A little later, about three. What's that! Chloe, Chloe! Come on, you have to see this. This is us. They're cute. Charm! - Baj. Take care. Nice transport for the President of the Management Board of our department store! He doesn't care about that. Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. How are you? Oh, Mrs. Kelly. Hi. Tell me, how is your little baby? Fine. - Wonderful. Seæate li se nje? Finerti. - Yes. Of course, we met at the baby's baptism. How many teeth are there now? He has five. Three up, two down. Five? Three up and two down? Oh, oh, oh. In our case. I hope ... Oh, I'm sorry. This is Mr. IS Borden, our president. Mrs. Kelly and Mrs. Finerti. How are you, I'm honored. The baby has five teeth and no more than ... How old is she ...? Eight months. And your boyfriend will graduate from military school in ... June? Indeed, Mr. Clayton ... You have an excellent memory! That's a very nice guy. He is this much taller than you. What can I do for you ladies? Tooth straightener. Tooth straightening? For your little child? - Yes. By the steps, on the third floor, and the first stand immediately to the right of the elevator. Why didn't you see them off in person? We do not have such customers every day. Not. Sam, we're in the middle of the season now, so don't waste time asking people how many teeth their baby has. It's neither Christmas nor New Year. Leave it for 11 months, but July is our hit month. We must take advantage of our predispositions. Now is the time to make money. So keep your eyes on confused fathers and husbands. They are ready to buy anything. And our job is to please them. Now is the time ... - Excuse me. Can you tell me where Hamboldt Street is? Hamboldt Street, 822. Near Glaremont. You have a map of the city right next to the phone, ma'am. You know Sam, we can't sell much for Pasha. Fathers don’t give much usually, but for Christmas, ha, ha! I broke my glasses and your suggestion is useless. Can I help you? Yes, your mother seems to have taught you manners. I raised myself. Do you know our city? No, I just got off the train, and I broke my glasses. I was in a dining car, I staggered, and they fell and shattered. This is bad. Well, it's eleven blocks from here. This is Maine, you need to go five blocks to Elma ... One short block and turn right, it takes you to Sikamore ... Oh God. It's too many streets. Maybe this will help you. Here we are, five blocks to Elm Street. Watch out for intersections, it's very dangerous. Five blocks to Hamboldt. It should be 822 right here. - I could take a cab. Whatever you want. This is very nice of you. So if I don't find it now ... I'd have to pass a mental test. Doviðenja. Sam, I want to talk to you. After counting the teeth, now you're wasting your time explaining to people how to find Hambold Street. And she didn't buy anything. Well, maybe he'll buy something one day. Sam, you and I don't see things the same way. You let the department heads go to Gilmore's funeral. It's bad enough that I have to leave. He was an advertising manager for 30 years. Yes, I paid for it for 30 years. At least they could bury him at night. So that my employees can go in their free time. Hey, šta kažeš on it? People are born at night, people die at night ... But they also play baseball at night, don't they? It's just that people aren't buried at night. Well, in my time they are. - I'm sorry. Can I have a free sample of your new cream, which you advertise and demonstrate? Here's your man. He is the director. Let's go this way. - Thank you. Here I am again. What happened, you lost the map? No, I was just walking and thinking. Hello again. I just told your employee I took a walk ... This is Mr. AS Borden, our president. How are you? - President? He? Born. Oh! I thought you were president. Ho, ho, ho. - Ha, ha, ha. Whatever. You were kind enough to show me the way ... I remembered that I was missing something. I thought I'd ask the advice of a smart man. Well, I'm sure we have whatever you need. What did you have in mind? Do you have knitting needles? What kind? Of steel or bone? For what type of wool? I do not know. I'd better take both. I have a granddaughter. Don't tell me you're a grandmother? Stop kidding! She is getting married. She will marry a fine young man. And how will I be left alone, probaæu da pletem. So, do you want to knit socks, or a wool coat? I had in mind ... to knit a giraffe scarf. Seriously, what would you like to knit? Some of those woolen socks are knitted. Well, it's a little hard to get started. You must first learn how to make points. That is basic. That's where you need to start. But we keep the course. - And for free! If he wants to use our needles, we'll tell her what she needs to know. I'll buy them. There's something on my mind, I planned to buy Johnny and Roddy a wedding present. If I buy it here, will shipping be free? Yes, it will be. I believe that things should be given to young people, right? So I'm going to renovate the house completely. With everything. Stove, refrigerator, washing machine, silverware, just about everything. And I need help not to forget something. It will cost several thousand dollars, but they are so young! I'm sure Roda and Johnny will be very happy. Johnny's last name is Camel. That will be a lot of fun. When Roda marries him, he will be a "camel rider"! Do you understand? He doesn't understand. What is it? Little baby hats? You don't think that's funny, do you? Sometimes I really wonder. Where is the French furniture? - Furniture? Thank you very much. I don't have the whole day at my disposal, I have to stick to the schedule. And you could be a little kinder. If it weren't for you, sir ... he would wait for me to come in front of the bus, and ran in front of my nose. Which wouldn't be a bad idea. Where is everyone in a hurry these days? Where is everyone going? They have absolutely no regard for anyone else. That is why it is a real pleasure to meet a person like you. I should wait 20 minutes for the next bus, and I have an appointment with the dentist. And you know how hard it is to make an appointment with them these days. Oh yes. You know, no one goes to the dentist often enough. Don't let them remove your wisdom tooth. Because if I didn't have wisdom teeth ... would have nothing to make a bridge? I can't thank you enough. Thank God there are still people like you. Today, everyone is so primitive, and selfish. I told my husband the other day ... I should have an earplug so I don't have to listen to everything. You get paid to drive a bus, and not to insult passengers. And all because of Sir Galahed ... who stopped the bus and made a hero of himself. Don't pay attention, sir. Accept that there are all kinds of people in this world. From a distance, he must have thought she was beautiful. I'm going to have to report this. What's your number? Here is everything you need. Just like I thought ... no hair! Ha, ha, ha, ha. That doesn't surprise me. Nothing can grow on such a head? Let's see the hat: Melvin Z. Vitzberger. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Luckily there are still people like you, sir ... Yes, you've said that before. Stop at the next corner, please. You could stay, maybe she could make you a cake. Why don't you shut that big barking mouth of yours? Do not worry. That's why people are using the railroad these days. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. I'm sorry she ran so fast, I thought he wanted to catch the bus. Hey, hey, take it easy! No one would expect this. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Good morning, Ruthie. - Good morning, Mr. Clayton. I like this department. Odlièan topic. Does Shirley May feel better? She's upstairs. Does she seem to jump? Yes, she's jumped once before. The next snail will be from the top of the bridge, remember my words. She is depressed. When I left this morning she was completely lost. I went with her many times. And he told me he was getting married. And she's a coward ... he didn't have the nerve to tell her himself. He went to his village girl and left her to take care of it herself. Heavy blow ... - Yes ... I took her to my house , Mr. Clayton, but you know that my husband and I have a child and only one room. You were there when I got married. If she is not helped, you will read about her in the newspaper. It will be a hit of the month, I guarantee. - Shirley May, can i talk to you for a moment Ruthie, replace her. You made a very good sale. I'll suggest you a raise. Oh, but I will resign, Mr. Clayton. Will you resign? - Yes. Why. Sit down. You know, this department has been doing great since you took it over. Why are you resigning? I can't take it anymore, Mr. Clayton. It's scary to sing those songs ... I know. You only have one problem. Where are you going to sleep tonight? I'll give you the rest of the day off and you find yourself a place to live. If you're unlucky, call me and i'll try to find something. You're too young and beautiful ... - Oh, sure. you will surely find a free man. Change the face and start a new life. Nice people, these Claytons. Oh, Mr. Nelson! How are you. And this is Mrs. Nelson, I guess. Yes, she is. We came to thank you for the goose fat, Mrs. Clayton. She helped her a lot. We must be grateful to you, Mrs. Clayton. We just stopped by to give you back the bowl. I filled it with a special meat sauce. Oh, you shouldn't have. That's very kind of you. Well ... Thank you. I hope we didn't come at an awkward time. Is it time for dinner? I'd like to invite you to stay for dinner ... Alright. I mean, we have ... you couldn't pick up tonight. We only have a small snack ... nothing special. Chloe says the beef is roasted and the pudding is done. Lu. Hello, Mr. Nelson. - Nice to see you, Mr. Clayton? And this is ...? My wife, whom I told you about. Thanks again. This sauce goes great with your steak. Claude won't be here tonight ... That's what I said, Sam. Will you come in? We can't stay long, but just ... Kloi! Everyone try the sauce and tell me how you like it. Was there goose fat in this jar? Don't worry, little man. I washed it with soap and water! That's it! I can taste the soap! Well. It is very tasty. What did you put in it, Mrs. Nelson? Well, first ... I know. Soap! Well. That. Kids come on, go to the kitchen. Can I get...? - Oh, I'm sorry. The kids will have dinner here with you, Chloe. That's what I thought. I want you to finish that dinner and neither of you to scream. Chloe, tell me if they're misbehaving. Yes sir. Oh, Sam, Mr. Nelson just said his wife was selling real estate. Oh, do you think it's a good time to shop, Mrs. Nelson? For me, the prices are always very low. Would you sell this house? We don't own it. The man in your position doesn't have a house? C, c, c. Klejtone. If the price was affordable, what kind of house would you be interested in? American antique rustic style is my ideal. Well, there is one. But it is not for sale yet. He is the owner of an architect and is currently in South America. And he brought all the furniture from Connecticut. What's that! It seems just like the house of my dreams! Look. Look at this! It looks like the same house. Really. - Yes. Do you hear this? When will you see him? When will we see him? We are waiting for news from him from South America. Oh Sam, wasn't it wonderful to take her? I mean, if he doesn't ask for too much. Yes, if the price is decent. What is now? Don't you want to buy a house? I'm sorry. I'll get back to you. Do you want a sauce? - No Thanks. My dear sister. I'm dear here. Please pass me the soap. You only have two? - Yes. Tell me, how many bedrooms are in the house? Three bedrooms and a storage space can be adapted. Oh, that's nice. He would use our extra space for the children. Do you have them? Sorry, but it's very important. Someone wants to see me, and he owes me some money. Maybe they'll pay me. - Oh, Sam, get ready, get your stuff. I wouldn't want to leave you. - Because of us? It's ... - Sam, I'll be fine. Our dearest friend! Welcome to our humble home! That's mom, isn't she wonderful. Oh Sam, we swim in happiness thanks to you. Sam, I'm not gonna kiss you, but I will extend my hand to you with great gratitude. Come, sit down. We invited you here, because we didn't know if Lou transferred anything to you because of the loan. No, everything is fine. How's work? Great! Our gas station is in the busiest place, we always have customers. I'll build a small room behind the gas station and we'll stay in it. That would save rent. I mean, if that's a good idea. I've already ordered all the material, but I can cancel if it's not smart. Not. I think that's a good idea. Oh, and when do you expect to start giving me back? Well, as the business progressed, I could start next month. And we could give it all back to you in six. Sam, I hope you feel OK about this thing ... because ... so sometimes we worry because ... you didn't tell Lou. No, it will be a big surprise for her when you start giving me back. That's much better. I would have come earlier, but the car ... he stopped three times, it will never be the same again. Did someone pay you back, or did you just have a nice dinner? I wasted no time, I 'll explain later. Oh, they didn't pay you. - No. Did you have a good time with the Nelsons? Oh, of course. When they finally left, I prepared a warm bath to calm down. And then, what do you think happened? Before you continue, I want to tell you that I'm sorry for the crowd with all these people. That's not fair. I really tried to spare you those things. No more Nelson at dinner, no more Butlers destroying our car ... Speaking of Butler, I have to tell you something. People say they broke the bumper ... što me je koštalo još 8.75 $! No. - Yes. I wonder why he didn't return the $ 19 he owed me. I didn't mean to tell you ... - Well, it's okay, Sam. Well, I thought you might ... resent me. What, yes? What's that. Not? I would not? You don't hate me? - No. Lu, obožavam te. Let's forget about other people tonight. Okay, if we can. Of course we can. Let's be selfish. Let's just think about us. Thank you Nelson! Damn the Butlers! What's up? Can't concentrate on your husband? Im giving my best. Has my love become funny to you? Yes, in a way, yes. You know me, don't you? I'm ... your husband! But Sam, you don't understand. - He does not understand... You remember the Butlers, don't you? - Butler's, huh? Good evening. Hi. - Hi. I hope you don’t think I’m offended. I hope you are not shocked. Not. Sometimes people forget that their pants are down. What's so funny? I guess you're wondering why we're here at this time. Yes of course. Couldn't you leave that for tomorrow? Born. You thought it would only cost you $ 27, didn't you? I mean, leaving the Butlers in your car. You haven't heard everything yet. They really had a picnic. They collided with another car. Another car? It was his fault! That's right. Mr. Butler drove watching his business, when suddenly in front of him ... But it was too late, wasn't it, Mr. Butler! Yes, too late. What's the idea? You didn't tell me about the accident, but you returned my car. I didn't mean to bother you with that. Razgovarao sam sa tim momkom i nadao se da æe biti razuman. Imao sam fin razgovor sa njim dole u jaruzi. Tie malo, Lu. Ali kad sam shvatio ta hoæe, znao sam da je smeno, ali vi æete morati da platite. Ja? ta je sa vama? Pa to sam mu i ja rekao. Ako mislite da tuite nekoga, tuite mene. Nemojte tuiti tako finog èovek kao to je Sem Klejton, nije bila njegova krivica, osim... pravno, to je bio va auto. Izjavio je da imam lou reputaciju da ne plaæam svoje raèune, samo zato to sam ostao bez posla. Nesreæno sam izgubio svoj posao. Vidi, pokuao si da im uèini uslugu, i on je izgubio posao zbog tebe. Takav je ivot. Kad ste nam pozajmili svoj automobil... odatle je sve poèelo. Reæi æu vam kako se to desilo. Let's hear that too. Oh, sorry, Mr. Butler. Keep going. You don't have to. Everything will be in the lawsuit, and I will read. Good night. Aren't you going too? Everything that happened to us, is just because we wanted to save some money. I know exactly how you feel. We are also trying to save, money to buy a house. Isn't it, darling? - Of course. It's the same with us. We hoped he would fix his eyes one day. Don't worry about my eyes. If they talked about what needed to be fixed, it would take all night. We'll work it out together! I can see like all people. Oh, thank you. There, dear. ON? - There. Oh, they were next! What do you think of this, darling? Do you want to pick me up so we can start all over again? You can count on it. Oh, do you have a bandage? He hit his head on a hanging vase. He was bleeding all over. Oh, my God, what is not going to happen to us. Now I have to tell you ... But I'm sorry, again ... Yes, I know, darling. But now the situation is slipping out of our hands. Our house is farther than ever. The damage has already been done. If this continues, we won't be able to buy a tent either. We can't do this anymore! Yes. Once you learn, that there are people who do not deserve your help. Just think about what people have done to us since we got married! How many did they give you back? Look at Claude, for example ... sleeping in my bed, our bed ... with you! Butch sleeps on the couch, I 'm here with Lulu. How long will it take? Sam, we don't have our privacy ... and my mother kept telling me about it. Honey, we'll try another arrangement ... - Except to kick my brother out. I know he was badly wounded, I tried hard to make it easier for him, but Sam, he has to move out. I think Claude has a lot of ... - Let him go. I can not. Let's wait for you to find your way. But he's not even trying! I know he looks ungrateful when I say that. He has done so much for his country. But ... if only he would go somewhere. Maybe he would find himself in South Africa. A lot of people made it there! I know how you feel. I'm not happy about that either. Mi smo tri "momka". Who could it be at this time? Whoever it is. Not a penny more. If he asks for a loan, just quit. Your brother won't be home tonight. Can we be sure of that? That. He's going to Cincinnati. Born! Yes, for ten days! Maybe he'll find his way there. What will he do there? There's a music festival there. Everyone from here goes there. Not my brother. What will he do there? He'll play pool. - It already looks like him. It's going to be a big tournament, it's pretty good, you know. Like you. I think billiards is a very nice game. Yes, billiards is a very interesting game, it's a very old game, and it's very nice of Claude to call us, isn't it? Father. Mother. Dad, you have to tell me a story! Alright. What story do you want? Cinderella! Let's go to bed first. There was once a little girl named Cinderella. She had two very ugly sisters. And she had very bad aunts? Oh yeah. They forced Cinderella to work from morning till night. Then she came from afar very good villa, and turned little Cinderella into a beautiful princess. And what about mice, Dad? What mice? Yes ... the fairy had mice. Is it? Oh yeah. And then she turned the mice into six beautiful white horses. Yes, that's right. Cinderella went to the garden and brought a pumpkin, and ... she gave to the horses. Not! - No? She gave it to a good fairy ... and the fairy took her and turned her into a six-wheeled chariot. That's right, I remember now! She harnessed six white horses to a pumpkin, I think, a carriage. and told Cinderella to jump in the carriage, and, fie, she left. They went to the ball. Yes, they went to the ball. And Cinderella had turned into a beautiful princess. Where am I? Ah, yes. Beautiful princess. She was so beautiful, she ... Oh, Boe. Such a beautiful princess! Ah, yes, and she lost her shoe ... they had many children ... Oh Dad, that's another story! They were all hungry. So they kidnapped, kidnapped from bears! Well, the poor bear had nothing to eat. Anyway, where did I stop? I'll tell you a story, Dad, and then you'll go to sleep. Alright. And Cinderella waited, day after day. It is important to know that she and the prince ... they were never together again. Suddenly, the door opened and the prince appeared in person! And everyone in the Kingdom of the Elves is asleep. Three piglets fell asleep, the evil wolf has fallen asleep, Little Red Riding Hood was so tired she fell asleep on her grandmother's doorstep, and the Cat in the Boots leaned against her. Everyone was so tired! Even the shepherd stopped counting the sheep ... Everyone slept ...! Except for you and me. What happened? Oh! This! And? What happened? I have a surprise for you! I left the tournament! Did he tell you? - Yes, I heard. You were so fast that I thought you didn't want to talk to me anymore. What's that... Hey, what's the reason? What are you two old men doing at this time? Oh, nothing ... what was that? We celebrated the longest day of the year. Yes, that is. I did not know! Mama! Explain it to him. I'll tell Lulu another story. Maybe he'll fall asleep with God's help. I will Sam. Is this Samuel A. Clayton's house? That. - I'm Sam Clayton. You see, I have a girlfriend in a taxi, she 's in bad shape. She asked me to stop in front of the pharmacy. I thought that was wise, but I didn't. I continued, and when I looked in the mirror, I didn't see her. I turned and saw that he was on the floor. But this is a private residence. Why don't you take her to the hospital. I would be wise to be in your place, maybe I'm doing you a favor! I found sleeping pills, but also your business card, Semuel A. Klejton! Oh, I know who it is. Shirley May! Shirley May. He knows her! Yes. Don't do anything stupid ... Lou's right there. Be quiet. Go and call Dr. Bruno, Orand 3621. All right, Sam. It's okay, Lou, she works at the department store. She overdosed on sleeping pills. Can we do something before the doctor arrives? What happened, Mom? I don't know yet, honey. You go to mom's bed. Lou, aren't you going to wear something? Lou, what's so serious? What is it? He doesn't drink. No, but sometimes I'd like him to do it. Do you gamble? No, but I would love for him to do that too. Did he fall in love with someone else? Gives. In everyone! He loves everyone! He loves the human race ... animals, birds and fish! He wouldn't leave a trampled fly, let alone those leeches that come to him. He just can't stop, to help people! So is that bad? How does it affect your life? What life? You say that marriage is a constant exchange. He does his best, and I just accept it. He is so compassionate with people. He will help his brothers, but he has too many brothers. He started with my brother ... and made ... He wants our house to be open to the sad ... and be friends with everyone! And I have to cook! Oh, don't look at me like that. I know I sound like an idiot! I know how I feel, but ... what I said did not turn out right. Zvuèi sebièno, ali ima i drugih reèi osim "elja", "udnja"... and "have a need." Lu, rašèistimo nešto. Many people think so there is nothing nobler than helping each other ... that it is the only way to make the world happier. But you are right. I always said that, and now there are unfortunates in my follower 's house. There is no doubt that happiness in the house is paramount. Sam is a good father. Do children suffer because of his actions? Oh, no, no. He is a good father! Is he a good husband? There's a blonde from the department store in our bed now , if that's what you mean. Oh no, no, it's completely harmless! She tried to commit suicide, so they brought her. Well, maybe Sam's exaggerating a little. I hope my last sermon is not a reason to exaggerate? Oh, no. No, it started differently. Maybe it's gotten a little stronger since then ... but he was always like that. Even on our honeymoon. He saw a man with a car stuck in the mud ... We stopped. My Sam went out, found some ... branches and dragged them under the wheels. Then, instead of chains, he used belts from our suitcases and tied them branches around the tire. Then with his hands on his knees, covered in mud, he said to the driver, "Try it now." The man started the car and ran over it. Then without a word of gratitude, or an apology, the driver drove away with our belts! Sam spent most of his honeymoon in the hospital. That's where I learned to play the saxophone! You might think he learned a lesson about helping other people. But no! Lou, you still love him. Give him another chance. I'll talk to him. I wouldn't want him to understand that I'm pulling away everything I'm behind. I'm not sure how to tell him yet, but ... I'll look for something moderate! Well, that might help. Where I could see him how do I meet him as "accidental"? Well, they could go to the Athletic Club, for example. It's usually there at lunchtime. If you haven't used all your energy! What will I make for dinner? What did you have for lunch today? Salad, a delicious salad prepared in the club, and a pair of hot dogs. Were you alone? Not. With Reverend Daniels. I asked him what he did at the club, and he replied, that a little exercise can't hurt anyone. Of course. You know, he's a man with a brilliant mind. People should appreciate his wisdom. People should listen to his advice more. Well, if you ask me, I think there are some problems. I think he has a problem with his wife. He? His? He was so upset that it would affect his health. So the poor man started coming to the club, and practice and the next is that he will try to cover up the shame. A. What did he tell you? Well, he didn't talk much at all. Mostly I was talking. He seemed so upset and unable to express himself. I think it's serious, Lou. You should have seen the look on his face when I suggested ... that maybe you could talk to his wife, and try to fix things. Gives. I told him ... that you have some problems with me too ... but you are so stable! I knew something was wrong when he said: "The happiness of our women is above all" He said, "we have to sacrifice everything it takes to achieve that." And did you have an answer to that? Not. I asked him a question: How much can a woman demand from a man? Should he always consult with her before making a decision? How reliable is her assessment ? How often will he make a mistake? If she does this often, he will ignore her because she has no assessment. I mean, if we put a coin in a beggar's hat, do we have to call her on the phone first, and spend a dime to get her approval? Pointless. - I would say. Mine is thinking ... if he wants to keep giving ... why not give her self-esteem as well? She knew him before she married him. She knew what she was getting into. Poor Mrs. Daniels. My new home. We'll take him! Wait to see the inside. Come on, Sam. Isn't this wonderful? And look at this look! Sem ... ask for the price Mrs. Nelson, and don't waste time! You won't have a problem with him. Not bad... Another fireplace, and it's real! You're making it harder for me to offer! I've never seen anything better. And you? Born. And we don't have to change the wallpaper! Is the bed too small for you? It's a little short, isn't it? - A little. Produžiæ emo ga. Oh Sam, look behind you. This is heaven. When I think of my wardrobe ... I hurt myself in it. Sem, šta nas spreava? Why not make a deal quickly? We can't finish a job like that. - We can not? They promised to wait. Why wait 24 hours? Šta èekamo? We have set aside more than $ 5,000 in a home fund. Sam, we'll never find a better place! And I promise you, I'll cut costs. In every possible way. And don't buy me a Christmas present, not a single thing. This is the most beautiful gift you have ever given me! This is the gift of my life. Guess who's here and they want to let you know something. Mr. and Mrs. Adams, that lovely little couple who used to live in the neighborhood. I miss them. As time flies. They left eight months ago, and she's as big as I am now! If he's a boy, Samuel will call him. And how will the devotee, Lusil. They can't wait, so they texted you. Thank you. - You're welcome. Is it confidential Sam, or is it money? 39,50 $. Why did they send you money? Last summer, when you were on the road, I spent some time with them and they had a problem. And what did good Sam do? He said, "Don't ask for more. I sold everything." "Evo vaih 39,50 dolara" Alright. You lent them money and they paid you back. That is nice! Lu... they were worried about whether or not to keep the baby. Which one did they know they would have? Things were bad for him, no money and no job. And then they had a chance to grab a seat on Highway 72 ... where many trucks pass. It is an extraordinary crossroads of Lu. and they would do very well. With $ 39.50? What would you do? Selling peanuts, Sam? Oh no, gas station. That's a lot of money, and it took them a while to find it. How much did you give them? It's a triple intersection, Lou. You see, 72 and another one here ... Sam, please. Oh, don't worry. They will give us back. You can't guess how many trucks are passing. We measured the frequency by the hour. You will be surprised. How many do you think there were? How much did you give them? Well, they would pay us back quickly, just ... behind the gas station they build small, fine ... Judgment? Yes, but not like this! Sam, you gave them all the money for the house. Lou, these people are really worth the effort ... - Oh, Sam! Let me explain, honey. Honey. You think children have the right to be born, don't you? Don't put a child in front of my face! I understand your "24 hour thinking." Why did you allow them to do that? It's more like, 24 years. What will the baby do? To sell newspapers and give them back to us? Oh, sem. Why don't people try to create conditions, and then give birth to babies! I know it's wrong that I didn't talk to you first ... but it was urgent, and you were in the village with your mother ... Is there a phone, Sam? The bank refused their loan because ... they had no guarantees, and I thought they would before ... '' Before I find out. I'm sick of my secret help to the people behind me. You are nothing but a fraudulently duplicitous secret Samaritan! Lu... They are good people. They were so desperate. Oh, shut up! Go away and leave me alone! You feel different when they have a child. Well, she will. Well, this is a pleasant surprise. I passed this way, so I said to see how the Claytons spend Sunday afternoons. Well, come on in. Well, I watched you two out of the corner of my eye this morning. And I'm glad to see you both look so happy. Yes, we are happy. Hey, how are you doing with your wife? Is she better? That. I don't think we have a problem anymore. I told her about our little conversation. She took it well, she understood your point. When I told her what you said about throwing coins in a beggar's hat, she laughed. That's good. Now it will no longer be necessary for Lou to intervene. No, no, I don't think that will be necessary. We both realized that our arguments were ridiculous. Everyone must make an effort and try to understand the other's point of view. A simple discussion of the problem and everything disappears as ... Lightning flashes. Reverend Daniels. Do you think women should be mothers? Yeah. I don't know who else ... Under the right circumstances, of course! That's what I thought. So I lent some money to my first neighbors. Ah, you are so soft-hearted! You ... you're a public benefactor! Hi, Reverend Daniels. Hi. - It's always a pleasure to see you. Well, I just stopped by, and I have a really good reason. Something Sam and I are ... and he said you would be interested too ... that is ..., e ... e ... Did you forget something for a moment? Dwarf pants, maybe? Not. Not. It's ... selling for charity. And Sam will volunteer as a gypsy who foretells the future. He will be a charlatan. He will raise a lot of money by predicting the future. Show her the costume you got, Sam. You show it to her. - Oh no, we're ahead. It's really beautiful! It's here. Isn't that a beautiful costume? You will look perfect as a gypsy! Gives. Gypsies don't have a home, do they? Good night, Chloe. From now on you will have to return home earlier. Good night, Chloe. - See you tomorrow! Hey, why do we ... can you give me another 15 min to share my vision with you. I'd love Claude, but it's really late. He is now only six in Australia. Come on, sit down, please. Alright. We need to make better use of our moments together. We better not do that, Claude. Your sister doesn't like me. Don't think about my sister. I want you to get rid of it. Your hair, your eyes, your lips ... And that bright smile! - Cut it out. Did I tell you I'd go miles for this smile, Did I tell you I would climb the highest mountains ... And in some other places. and got my complexion there. Are you impressed? I really like Claude a lot, but The Claytons are spare for me, I don't think he'll approve. See, you don't know me well. Well I'm trying it, the best I can! Who is that? We're caught. Don't move. Napraviæeš nam kafu? It would be good. It was really hard tonight. You didn't say a word on the way home. I thought you'd have a good time and play a lot when you see them. You do it well. Sam, HC offered to take me back to my old job. He wants me to travel to Europe in the spring to buy , of course with your approval. It's a golden opportunity to save some money ... and I will be on the road for three to four months. Maybe it da zaboraviš! Is that what you think? - Of course it is! I don't understand why it bothers you. You can barely see me anyway. If I leave, you can do what you want. I may be surprised when I return to how many more organizations you have joined. If I accepted that job, we could completely renovate the furniture! Unlimited expense account. And freedom of purchase. I'm going to Europe! I don't blame you for feeling that way, but I don't want you to work. What is it? - What. If we continue like this with charity and lending Sam, we'll never have a home. I know how much a house means to you. Oh, it's not just a house, that's all. All those problems you brought into my life. I'm starting to lose my mind thinking about them! Problems? Which ones, for example? Problems? Which ones, for example? And Shirley May, for example. She burst into our house like Magdalena and how did he repay you for your kindness? Trying to get along with my brother! Oh, I know Claude isn't an angel either but rest assured I won't let that stray cat grab him. My mother would turn in the grave. Would you? - Yes. And every girl who tries to commit suicide ... because the married man refused to pay her expenses so he's trying to figure it out, it's hardly an ideal opportunity, even for my brother. Maybe your brother knows her better than you do. Maybe she's better than everyone around him. Oh. - If she marries him, doesn't mean he'll live with your family. Don't change the subject. Do you want to ask her to leave, or will I? And... Claude ... I'm sorry you heard that that way. I was planning to tell you in my own words, a little different. I would probably humiliate myself much easier. See what you made me say. And? Good evening. - Hi. We are Mrs. and Mr. Adams. We used to be the first neighbors. Do you want to come in? - Thank you. Let us know. Come on, little mother. Take it easy now. We are old friends of the Claytons. And we drank a little. - I didn't, he drank my drinks too. You should know that Sam Clayton is the best friend I've ever had. Without him, my wife would not have her own baby. Ah, here they are. To our dear friends and benefactors ... Two hearts of gold! Come on, little gypsy. Zar vam se ne sviða valcer? Why that waltz? We celebrated Mrs. Clayton. We had a few drinks. Ah, ah! - I mean, I had a few drinks. What did you drink? Petrol? Is it selling badly? They didn't just buy gasoline, they bought the whole gas station. Sam, let me tell you something amazing. The guy came to the station and was delighted. He said he liked me. He added that he was watching me from the corner as trucks passed by. In short, he wants to buy my growing business. I think that will cover all our costs. You need some air. Who is this? - Claude. How are you? - Nice to meet you. And then he asked me how much I was asking for the station. And I replied without laughing, "$ 2,500, with the little house in the back. And without laughing, he said, "I'm taking it." And it paid off right away. And here is your part! There's an extra thousand dollars. Oh, no, you don't have to ... No comment, we made it thanks to both of you. I already bought another place. You can join if you want. Trust me, I would do anything to do you a favor. Yes, we could give Claude a job, he knows a lot about gasoline. He has it. Here, look for me, Claude. Shall we celebrate now? Are we going to play somewhere tonight? It's pretty hard to get us started. Sorry for the intrusion. Come, little mother. I think I'll go with them. Make sure you don't get drunk. Lu. Someone gave us our money back. I am happy for many reasons. For them, and for themselves. That confirms my trust in people. It's weird, Lu, we're so close in so many ways, and yet we see things differently that I consider important. I wish we could agree ... about what is really valuable in life. I find happiness in things different from you. I guess I exaggerated sometimes ... ... helping them, and I didn't mean you and our home. And I realized that both things were important to me. But you weren't there when I talked to them and it seemed so okay to tell them they had to have a baby. Otherwise they would have regretted it for the rest of their lives . He would later find himself saying: "He would be 16 now ..." At that moment, our house seemed less important to me. Maybe it's not well balanced for me ... but ... but when I put something aside, and material things to another, this prevails in me first. God. I will never change, Lou. That's what I am. So, when are you going to Paris? Who will go to Paris? Thanks again for everything. I'll be fine, Mr. Clayton. I'll be at Ruth's. Our neighbor brought us ... ... and a happy family life. Claude, I feel bad now. Why don't you go to your sister's and she'll tell you all about me! That's probably my sister. She told me she would come to see you. Oh, no. No, Claude. I don't want to see your sister. Zašto ne? Because... It would be nice. She regrets what she told you. And he wants to tell you that. Come on, give her a chance. Uði sestro. I came to show her my uniform. I'll tell you I love her, and we've already set a date. Lou, I'm counting on you to get her everything she needs. Flowers, dresses, you know all about these things. Make it look fabulous Lou. You know, after all, I'd like to be proud of my bride. Doviðenja. Can I sit down? Is there anything else wrong with me? Didn't you say everything yesterday? What else do you have in mind? Say it! I was just wondering if my wedding dress would suit you. I think she'll be fine. Of course, if you like blue. It will go well with your hair and eyes. And I would be more than happy to wear it. I can bring it, so you'll try it. Unless of course you have some ideas of your own. You look beautiful in white too. I love blue. Mrs. Clayton, I will make your brother have a wife like no other. But I want to be honest with you. I'm not as bad as you think. Oh, please. Do not. Let's talk about shoes. I know exactly where to buy them, trust me. Oh yes... eir. I love your brother so much. Me too. But I don't want him to marry meaninglessly. I know, and I understand. Really? I think we have two of the best men in the world. I know I have. Speak for yourself. It is true that Claude is somewhat different. I think it's time to tell you that you have the most wonderful husband in the world! Did you read the morning paper? - No. Look. Sam Clayton is preparing Christmas dinner for the homeless again Contribute to Sam Clayton, President. Hello dear. Hi, nice to see you. Thank you. What are you doing? - Do I take classes on the 3rd floor? So, how ... how are you? So good? Ha, look! My first couple. - Are they pretty? You will get the first pair. What size are you wearing? - Eleven-thirty. I'll make them for twelve. Maybe you'll grow a little more. Mr. Clayton. Here's the money from the fourth and fifth sparts. The response is 100%. Everyone gave. Except for Mr. Borden. What's going on here? You see, every year Mr. Clayton organizes a Christmas meal for the poor. Everyone in the department store donated. I'll give you this. I'm going to school here. Oh, thank you. You should take all that money to the bank. Someone will hit you on the head. - That's right. That's where I'm going. Doviðenja. - Doviðenja. Hello, Mr. Clayton. Is the truck waiting for me? That. - Where are the turkeys? There in the truck. Three more tours are coming. I achieved top quality. Here's the bill. The price is also higher! Well, I had to feed them. You know how it goes. Here, I'll pay for the whole delivery. Thanks, Joe. Thank you, Mr. Clayton. Merry Christmas! Thank you. The same goes for you. - Goodbye until next year. Doviðenja. I shouldn't be here. How much is it... Hey, she took my watch too! What happened? All I know is that someone hit me on the head. How did you even get here? She had a heart attack! She said she didn't want me to take her to the hospital. That it would be good if I took her home, so I brought her here. I asked her if she had had crises before. She said only when she lost a child. Baby, hey! What would you like to carry all that money with you! Don't you have a bank? Yes I have. Bank? Yes, I have to go to the bank! Hey, they beat you good! Are you better now? Yes, I'm better now. You see, Al, I actually paid for the parties with house money. Now that I’ve lost employee money, I have to borrow. Is there a way for the bank to grant me a loan? I'd love to help, Sam, but my hands are tied. Too many people know you now, You were considered a terrible risk even before this happened, it's even worse now. So if I don't think of something ... we will lose our new house. I'm sorry I can't help you, Sam. Have another drink. On the one hand, this blow to the head disturbed me a little. I have a minute for you. So Sam. I hope that, in spite of everything, you will somehow have a merry Christmas. HELP OTHERS Donate your worn-out clothes - furniture - newspapers and magazines Hey, can you clear my passage? - Alright. Yes! Why are you home so early? Oh dear, this is absolutely the happiest day of my life! And I have good news for you. Guess what? Lu. Where are we ... carrying the couch? Sam, listen, the Nelson told us to move into the house right away. Isn't that wonderful! Yes Yes. Well, you look more surprised than delighted, darling. Oh, Sam. You were right, I was wrong about many things. Did I? - Yeah. Lu. Where do they take our ...? That's what I meant. I donated all our furniture. Did you donate furniture? Stop them Lou! Why? Oh, look at Sam. I can tell you now. I'm sick of watching him more. I'm tired of every deed. The second-hand dealer offered me almost nothing, so I called the Salvation Army. Why not give it to them? I feel like that's what I'd like to do. It will be a beautiful Christmas present for a poor family ... and will make her as happy as ours. What was it, darling? What is wrong? Oh, it's nothing. Why are you talking like that? You work a lot. This Christmas dinner must give you a headache ... Yes, indeed. You donated everything, didn't you? Of course. And I have another big surprise for you! Another surprise? Are you ready, Mrs. Clayton? - Oh, I'll be right there! Where are you going? That's another surprise. We'll have dinner at our new house today. I thought of everything. Everything you love is on the menu, including me. Oh, and don't come home until half past six. I want everything ready! You have something to think about. Dinner will start with a surprise ... At any cost! Goodbye! See you in paradise! So you asked everyone to lend you money. Gives. And you didn't even get a dime? - No. Well, that's how it always happens. Everyone says, "You couldn't have chosen a worse time," "I'd love to help you, Sam, but I can't now." But now I need it too! "I'd love to lend it to you, Sam, but you know what medical bills are." "I just got to my feet, and I've already broken them." "We're sorry, Sam, but my three guys are in the hospital ..." "Ne, tri momka su mi na koledu..." "And my mother-in-law is on the machine ... the oxygen machine." Oh! "But rest assured, if I had the last thing, I'd give it to you." "Ali ne sada." "Ne sada." "Can you wait until April?" - Yes, some April. Yes, all people are the same, Sam. I know what you mean. I'd love to help, but I have this stock trader, he ran away with all my savings last month . It must have been a heavy blow to your wife. It's not. She went with him. Maybe I should pay for your drink. I can handle it, thank you. Mrs. Clayton, you look magical. Yes, I hope it makes my husband forget how much it cost me. Hoæe. Mom, when's Daddy coming home? Every moment, honey. We're hungry, Mom. Show Mom what you're going to do when Dad comes. Come on, Chloe. - Alright. Let's all go. We'll start together, this time. Do you remember the end? Yes, ma'am. - Yes. Okay, here comes Dad. Good evening, dear father. We're glad you're here! It's so nice to welcome you! We all want to show you how glad we are to see you and we know it will be good for you to hear what good news we have for you! Now that we have a better house we will all be better! And you will be much better! A? I didn't say anything. Do you know what Confucius says about helping people? You said so much that I'm all confused. Pa, on kae... Confucius makes me fall into ... confusion! Everyone says they have their book at home. An old Scottish saying goes ... "You'll never forget when you held out your hand ..." So in Scottish it is said to forget. To know. I saw Harry Lauder in the Palace sometime, 1917. Let me quote ... - All right, here you go. "He who despises the life of a drunkard turns his back on life." Well, I wouldn't say that ... "He who drinks turns his back on his source." That's less precise, don't you think? Maybe he works overtime. Why don't you call him? Will Dad bring us some raspberry ice cream? No, honey. We'll surprise him. Do you think something happened to him, Mom? No, Dad's fine. Maybe not. Even the Arabs warned me, saying: Sam, "Do no good and you will not suffer ingratitude" Look at the clothes they're wearing. They have no pockets. Ask an Arab for money, and he'll pack you up right away and expelled from the camp. Gives. Will you buy me a drink, buddy? Go your own way sad face. Leave us alone! I need a drink. I'm in crisis. Dude, I knew better times. Carry your memories and get out of here. Go back to my friend, I'll pay for your drink. I don't understand you, Sam. You called him again. But Tom, there is something good in each of us. But the only good thing about it is my whiskey. Not everyone is as happy as we are. All they need is a helping hand. Do I need it? He, he, he. I don't remember hearing such a stupid thought. A, ha ha, ha. All I can see is that you are satisfying your vanity. Sam paid for my drink, and now I should be happy with it! Everything but inside. Why do you feel better than me? Oh, why don't you come out bastard! This guy has his problems. He's in trouble! - Yes! He's in trouble! - Yes! He's a big fish! He has it all! You can afford to be kind. What a nice coat. Look at his clothes. Look at. And look at mine! Keep talking and he'll take it off. That's what I want to see, my friend! That's what I want to see! There are many beautiful stories in this world but no action! No action? - No action. Do you want to see some action now, buddy? That's what I want. - Action. Hey, what are you doing? - I'll call the police and put that bastard in jail! Ops! No no. Do not do that. Come back. Why don't you go to bed and sleep through all this? Here he is again. He sits in his silk suit, and laughs. Because he knows very well that I don't have a home or a bed in which to rest my head! Not? - No. I didn't know that. - That's right. I'll find you one - All right. You want me to sleep, don't you? Thank you. Don't forget to give him a coat from your back. Al, vratiæu se. Don't drop it here. And get your hands off the fence. Get him out of here. How are you? - How are you? I'm Mr. Drew from the bank. - Yes sir. I'd like to see Mr. Clayton. Bad time to see him. He's not here. Can I see Mrs. Clayton? - Well ... It is very important. - Yeah, yeah. Well, wait. Oh, I think you better come in. I feel directly responsible for what can happen. I refused his loan because I had no guarantees. Then I started thinking. What kind of world is this? There must be something wrong if a man like your husband ... he can't get credit. It doesn't mean that banking rules are changing, but even a good heart should serve as a guarantee. So stay calm, this house is yours. Oh, what wonderful news! If only he were here! He knew I wanted this more than anything else in the world. More than I wanted him. Stupid! Doði moj momak! Give me mine. You've had enough, Sam. Go home! What should I do with a guy like this? Forgive him now. Come back, will you ?! No, I want to be alone! Am I going to have problems with you now? You won't, if you leave me alone! Sam, you're a very nice man ... Who is a nice man? You! You have no evil in you. I don't have it, do I? - Well, you seem to have it. Give it to me, will you? Give it to me, Sam. Give me... From now on, I'm the meanest in town! Look and you will see. I'm starting to believe! The first hand that comes to my aid, I will ... next one who comes with an outstretched hand, look what I'm going to do ... Oh, sem! Excuse me, miss. I'm terrified. He's a good guy when he doesn't drink. I think I should make up for something with you, miss. Here, miss. I'd like you to help me get him out of here. Take him home? I'm sorry, miss. - Do not. Thank you. All right, Sam. You'll be fine. I appreciate the palace ... but we made a home we behave so modestly, nowhere is it like at home! Home, home, sweet, sweet home nowhere is it like at home! Be modest, o why don't you go home? Home, home, sweet, etc. We'll find him a bed. Do you want to, miss? - Yes. Oh, that's wonderful! That is nice. Take this. I hope it helps a little. Thank you. - You're welcome. Let's go. - Wait, he's tied up. ARMY OF SALVATION CINDY CORPS Take him. Oh I drank nothing but water! Hi Chloe, where's Sam? Sam is not here. - Is not it? Hi, Lou? Hi Claude. Do you want a cigar? Do you want a cigar ... Father? And you, sir, have a cigar. - Lou is here. The baby is a boy. 8 pounds. Little Sam! Isn't that wonderful? So what happened? Isn't anyone happy about the baby? Sam Clayton is gone. - Oh! Something terrible happened to him. We are terribly worried. What could happen to Sam? People love him, he has no enemies. He's too good a man to disappear. He'll show up already. No one would hurt him. He took care of everyone. And everyone took care of him. The world needs Sam Clayton! Me too. It's Sam! Oh, no! We found his address. Is that your husband? Aha. They are wonderful people, Lou! Yes dear. I'm a failure, Lou. I'll join them! You deserve a better chance than me. I'm not good enough for you, Lou. You're still young and so attractive, aren't you !? And you are, honey. I ruined our lives, I stumbled upon myself ... You only stumbled upon the vice president of the department store! Gives. Since the banker is here, he will lend us money, so the house is ours now! That's right! And he didn't drink! Did you hear that? I'm not ... I'm a failure! Do you have successful people? Thank you very much! You really are wonderful people! I'm so glad I gave you all my furniture, because you brought him home safely! Furniture goes through the water, as they say. I want you to come to the house and take a big sip of soda ... Hot chocolate? Hot chocolate! No thanks, I think we better get going. Merry Christmas to you! Merry Christmas. Hey, wait a minute. Just another song? Alright. Which one will it be? I know! Let me call you "baby." I'm in love with you, you will make me happy ... if you whisper to me ... that you love me too. All right, I love you too. You carry the flame of love ... - Flaming. ... blazing in your blue eyes. Let me call you "baby." Translated by: suadnovic
