The legendary Number 1 headband. It's promises power, omnipotence, immortality. But at what cost?! One that is greater than any man can imagine. And heavier than any man can bear. No soul who has ever worn it... Has ever escape the torment of his perpetual burden. The headband shall be... ...Ours! Touche! Come on you bastard! Son. Father? Jinno? Do you remember me? I remember you... And all that you have done. Murderer, monster! How many hundreds of lives have you ended? How many thousands have been made mourn the loss of their loved ones. Now, it's your turn. I know the one thing you care about. And when I bring him back from the dead, I'm gonna toy with him... Torture him. Your father was suffered the punishment for your sins, Afro Samurai. Unless you find the Number 2 headband and try to stop me. Do you have the balls? So go fetch, boy! Come for me Afro Samurai. The Number 1 headband on my forehead... You are bound by your samurai code. Take the bait to find the Number 2. Come for me, so I can crush your heart and body, as you have crushed mine. Now, don't we look like shit?! How you been man? Ain't seen you in a while! UUUH... You get kind of all ancient. Look at this poor blade, it's all jacked up. Man, things sure have changed! So how come you not wearing the Number 1 headband, huh? I had my revenge. Ain't you learned nothing yet? Whatever your reasons, once you put on the headband... You can never really escape! But anyway, how's that Teddy Bear guy still alive? Didn't you dead him already? Guess not,'cause he own the strong rebound and put much foot in your black ass. And did you kiss that honey, he was ridin' with? She's the new Numero Uno now! Damn, she's major bootylicious too! She's got ass for days...! Even in a cold ass rage she get me hot a trout! It begins again. Allright! Now, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout! We're raw dawgz again! But if you going anywhere with me, we gots to get you cleaned up and ratchet to rumble... Are you sure this fragments of a bone are enough? Please rest assured, in 2 weeks we shall be witnesses to a miracle. Sio... My heart felt gratitude for your generous help with my experiments. With the completion of this ultimate being, we shall superseek the power of God himself! The world will be in our hands. I shall be the one to decide how we use this miracle, professor Dunnar. And it is you who is helping us. Don't forget that! My apologies Your Highness, Miss Sio. This is simply a perfect coincidence of interests. Please be assured that I will use all of my resources for your service... My most noble and beautiful lady Sio. Very wise of you. Setting of the restructuring system is complete. You three! Monitor Afro, and keep me posted on his moves. Understood. The time is finally upon us. All preparations have been made, to get our revenge on Afro Samurai. You're lookin'a little refreshed now of course that didn't wipe that pissed look off your face. You know, I mean... To steal your daddy's funk ass remains in the middle of the storm... That's just creepy right? All decomposed and shit. I mean, who does that? For real! But I fail in you. This pissed you off so much, you're gonna hit the road again. To find a NO.2 headband again, just so you can fight the NO.1 again! All this just to get your daddy's nasty ass skull?! He dead already. What's the big deal? I have no choice. My father must rest in peace. Can we just leave well enough alone? Wise men say... The state of the sword is a reflection of the soul. Only the blade is clean now, my brother. The rest is up to you. Afro has begun to move. Keep your eyes on him. We don't gotta do this, you know! Come on, maybe you just have to chill. Change your mental state, pick up a sport or somethin'. I mean, check me out! I am happy because I smile all the time! You though never smile, and therefore people don't likes you! Even without that headband would they still want to fight against you. You just ain't no fun, bro! You're always focused on killing this guy, killing that guy... How are you gonna pull a lady? I guess the strong, silent types do always seem to get the girl, but... Hold up, hold up, hold up! Wait a minute! You know I just realised... This is the first time I'm seeing you without the NO.2 headband. And you know what? You look kinda funny. It's weird man, I knew something was odd. I mean, your forehead is huge, bro! I thought your hair was big, but daaamn! That's a four times, four times, forehead. That's what they mean when they say headquarters. You're a big headliner, a headmaster, a... Shut up. Now I remember. The strong, silent, and sensitive type. Hey, where we going? Is it true? He's heading this way? Oh yeah, it's him. I can't forget those eyes and hair. The cursed creature who cut down my Shumi. The demon who slaughtered those we love. We can't let this opportunity passes by. Revenge will be ours. I do not think we can take him down. - He's too strong. We're not ready yet! There's ain't enough of us! C'mon, they say he hasn't held his blade in years! It's true, he's weak! Now is the only chance. We strike now. Hey, how come you guys know so much? That lady over there, she knows all about him. None of you know nothing! What gonna kill him gonna do? Everything is already gone to shit anyway. You're wrong! It was only after Afro Samurai kill Justice that the world descended into chaos. Men had always kill for the headbands but after Justice died, and Afro refused to replace him, then he began to kill for the joy of killing. That's when my husband fell. He is coming! Afro Samurai is coming! As Lady Sio had anticipated. Things are moving, just as she planned. You might need this. You murdered my father. You murdered him! You killed my only brother! And my best friend! This is for my dead son! A curse on you demon! You will burn in hell! You will drown in a blood of those innocents you have slayed! You will suffer the blades of all of us, even after death! Curse on you, Afro Samurai! Oh snap! Now this is more like it! Yo man! Let me hold some gals. The Afro Samurai is here. Send him in, won't you. OK, now! Here's the plan, You'll do something and... I'm gonna lap dance, and meet you in 5 minutes. WHOO! Hold up dog... Let's get in! Oyideyassu. The NO.2 headband. I am afraid, I can not give you the location of the NO.2 headband... For free. But if you can defeat me... Not by a sword. We play... These. If you win, I'll tell you where to find the NO.2. If I win, I have your head. Do we have a deal? Escort Mr. Afro to the gambling area. Unlike you brother Wong... I only play games that I know I'll win. Now, that was off the chizzin'! Yo Afro, I got 2 for one dance man. Wow, wow, wow... Hey, what I missed? Oh, we're gambling now? Cool! Let us start the game. Play on the black. Ooops! Wrong game. Call! Odd. Even. Double ones, even. Afro Samurai, now that you lost fair and square... I must ask you to fulfill your... Fair? That cheatin' son of a bitch! I want free lap dances behind that. The NO.2 headband! The NO.2 is a ronin named Shichikoro. He is in the village called Machisiri, to the west. Couldn't we have stayed a few minutes longer in that gambling house? This shit is boring, man! You're boring! The very demon of revenge, seeks divine guidance? Do you really think you can absolve yourself of sin, by sculpting stupid lil' toys? Now, that's some shit you don't see every day! You're fallin' so far... Coward! I've been watching you... Can you even rage your sword against another? Where is the cold-blooded killer, you once were? Do you no longer have the stomach to fight? Well you remain a coward, even as your father suffers. Oh now, that's just ain't nice. You have to listen to that shit? And you have such a long, long way to go... To save your poor tortured father. I've almost revived his rotten bones. Oh, he will live again! To feel pain... To suffer. And you don't even have the NO.2 headband yet. So, I have a few more days or maybe even weeks... To enjoy your father's pain before you even have the right to challenge me. Watch your damned mouth... 'cause I am comin' for my Dad! Damn! We are comin' to get you bitch! You are weak, my head love. Now the fun begins. She don't know who she's fuckin' with. Jinno. At last he's become to move. All is proceeding as planned. You will have your revenge. But to succeed... You and I my love, must walk the path of demons. I'm truly sorry... But this is the only way to make him feel the eternal sadness... That we have felt. To make him suffer, as we have suffered. So, please... Forgive me. Just remember... That there was no alternative. I will always love you. My beloved brother. Your luck sucks man. Everybody know this is a first day at a year liberate round here. You ain't get no info of these party people about NO.2 headband. His name was Shichigoro, right? You even ain't got any idea what he look like, I don't. How we even gonna know that's his real damn name? Point I'm trying to make is this is all a bad idea... Out of my way! A kidnapping in the broad daylight?! That's a damn shame! Ah, shit! Afro Samurai. Out of my way! No damn! I said move, you son of a bitch! Gun Afro, gun! Hit the rascal gab's gun! Kotaro! Oh daddy! Kotaro, I told you to stay close. I'm sorry. You, you have my thanks. This coward kidnapped my boy... Forget it. Let me buy you a drink. I know a spot nearby. I think I lost a ninja boot. Wait, I am drownin'! Hey Afro! Don't leave a brother! I'm home, old man. Hey, you brought a friend today. This man saved Kotaro's life. So maybe he's strong enough not to die from your stew, old man. Watch your mouth when you talk about my oden Shichigoro, you might find a hot pepper in your bowl. You call this crap oden? More like chunky rat poison. Anyway, give me and the kid the two of usual and throw a couple of cup sake, hot. Come in right up! Chunky rat poison! Just for you, you little street rat. You're the street rat. Hey, I'm back! And get my shoes too. You're gettin' your grub on? UUUH... Something smells funky! Oh shit that's to do! What do we have, partner? Sukiyaki. Double then! Cheers to you. Oh not a drinker, huh? You don't know what you're missin'. Lemonade then? Kidding, kidding! Forget it, I drink them both! You aren't here for the festival, are ya? Me neither. Just passing through. But I guess we overstayed a bit. We had our chuckles at the festival. But it's best we move on. It sucks you've gotta kill this dude. I gotta say, he ain't so bad. And cool! It's always lonely after the festival. At least, this is the last time I'll have to eat your lousy rat poison. You'll be sorry. I make the best stew for miles around. When you come back, remind me to charge you double. This is the best?! Afro, maybe I kill here too for lyin'. This stew sucks! Lemonade. Please help yourself. That guy earlier. The man you cut down. You wanna know why he tried to kidnap Kotaro? Hell no! You wanna know why anyone bothers with a street kid and a drunk like me? It's OK old man. OK, tell us. I've got something everybody wants. One minute he's stuffing his face, the next he's passed out. He ain't even mine, he's an orphan. Son of a pal got himself murdered. I promised to watch him if he ever got in trouble and killed. Me and that old bastard, we were like brothers. He wasn't the brightest, but he was a good man. He died when this kid was to pop. I heard a man who killed him had a weird look. An afro hairdo with a greenish tint, if you looked real close. Now you listen to me, and you listen good. In this world there are bonds, deeper than blood. My pal that dumb son of a bitch, he was like so many fools, went after those headbands of legend. All he wound up was his death. You know what he said to me when I found him dying? "No more", he whispered. So, I got that NO.2 headband myself and I hid it. And I'm around ever since. But now you've come. And now we're even. So, let's get this over with. It's all now, no more Mr. Nice, bro'. Keep that poison hot old man, I'll be back in a flash. I thought if Kotaro and me just kept moving, maybe folks would forget about it all about my pal's wish... And peace for his son. But I guess, there's no hiding from a fate. Damn it. All these damn headbands do is make dead bodies and orphans. Do you hear me, Afro? Dead bodies and orphans. So, I ain't giving you the NO.2 headband you'll have to kill me to get it! Not because I'm playin' by the headband rules, not because I'm at to save the world either. Wassup with the formal stance? I mean, he is cool, but he ain't your pal. Just dead this fool! It's because I keep my promises. Don't think I don't know you Afro Samurai. I saw what you did on a boardwalk. Killing a man without a moment of hesitation. Like he was nothin' but a fly on your face. Maybe it's time someone swatted you. Maybe I feel like I'm the guy to do it. You gonna let him talk all that trash? Slice him, dice him Afro! Sayonara, Afro Samurai. Now that's just whack. You're gonna die, pretty. This guy's slick. I'm impressed! He just might kill your ass. You're runnin'? You're makin'us look bad, dude! Where you're goin'? I knew you'd be devious. We never run from nobody! We ain't about to pick a day to start runnin'. Hey man, keep on swingin' while I get my groove on! Let's party! Everybody like rock stars. Lightshow, a lightshow! Bring in, baby. Yo, look out for this party tracker right now. On the stage, you've got the man with a NO.2 headband. Hey where do they come from? This is only half cook. You expect me to eat this? I broke my teeth on this crap! This is disgusting! How do you even stay on business? Come on let's get out in here This place should be shutdown! Dad? You killed the music! Why you always gotta wreck the party? That was an unnecessary distraction. You still wanna die? You want it that much. It is just a piece of cloth, you idiot. If you're feelin' so lucky, come and get it! Summenarae? Suma nari? Sumen nare? You always got to bust up the fun, don't you. I was raving until the break of dawn, man. Like tits and everything... Why you gonna ruin it? That they'll even cancel the damn thing next year, and it's all your fault. And another thing! You ain't all that just 'cause you're back to be in NO.2 again. Don't you get it? We're walking the demon path again. It ain't the right way! So where we goin' next? How about gettin' a lil' push-push first, know what I'm sayin'? Man we'll never party. Damn. That was kinda jump off. Didn't they already kick your ass? They come at you again. Your blade stains the world with blood. Oh ya, then? You kill only for your selfish petty reasons. Have you no heart? This can't be real man. Who the hell are these people?! This ain't possible! I don't think so. You should restrain yourself or risk another humiliating beating. You don't want to risk breaking my new toy, do you? He's ever so fragile, right now. Go to the Cherry Hill, or he dies again. But this time, much, much, much... More slowly. Watch your damn mouth. Ben! My lady, step back. You allright man? No. Hey, easy, little sis'! It's been a long time, hasn't it Sio? How have you been, princess? Good. And our foster parents, how are they? Oh, they've been great! They are like real parents. And they got this kind of Bin-san, he's kinda checkin' scared. And this other guy Michael-san, he plays with me a lots! Oh, oh... And there's this lady Tomoe-san, she teaches me to be the real princess. I even learned to dance, and have tea and everything. Wow, that's great. I wish you could be here, with me. I know lil' sister, but you're safe here. This family wanted a daughter of their own to replace the one they lost. Now I see that they accepted you as their own. We should both be grateful. I'll try to visit more OK? Hey, there's someone I want you to meet! This is Afro. Afro, this is Sio, my sister. Oh, hi Afro! He's a newcomer at the sword school, but he's really good. Almost as good as me, he's like a brother. Brother? Uh uh. So I guess, that makes you my brother, too. Yeah, I guess. Cool! I just got another brother. Yup. Can I see the sword school someday too? Yeah sure, anytime. You're shy. And your hair is funny. Nice to meet you too. You'll soon be free. You can't just toy with science like that Lady Sio. Are you mad?! Once he's completed, he could very well be the ultimate samurai! But if his growth is interrupted... He could end up just a pile of worthless protein jelly! Mad? That's a strange word coming from the very image of madness. But our plans could've been ruined! It's part of the process, dear professor. The more I taunt Afro, the better. I want his suffering to be long and slow. His death is not my goal, only the final exclamation point. Don't you know me by now? Of course, Lady Sio! You are truly twisted! But it's just... Risks! What a refreshing experience! I've twisted the most twisted scientist in the world... With my twistedness. Don't fear, my round friend. Everything is moving so deliciously. Have a little faith. Yes, my Lady. With my guidance it won't end as badly as your failed masterpiece Kuma. Look at him! You've repaired him so many times there is no human left at all. He's just a mindless samurai doll. Soulless, dead. It disgusts you, doesn't it? The failure. I mean... The frustratingly crude limits of the human body. But even your full mechanical works have been destroyed. The Afro-droid... Scrap metal at the bottom of the ruined temple of the Empty Seven. But now... Muscle, bone, blood. By all merge with nano-technology, chemically programmed neuroceptors, and things so forbidden, it's more alchemy than biotechnology. You truly are the world's most wicked, shit-faced genius scientist. You'll burn in hell for your insults against nature. You praise me so wonderfully, Lady Sio. I am not worthy of your poetry. You scum. History will mourn your trustees you now commit. You should be burned alive. Afro will chase me and my brother to ruined city. When he arrives, he will see the consequences of his sins. His twice killed only friend, and his beloved father, shall impale him with their vengeful blades. And then, the last moment, these hands will be the ones that end the life of Afro Samurai. He's not even worthy to die by your heroic and wicked hands. But his end will not bring him bliss, my professor. It is hot, up in this piece! Ain't there a quicker way to Cherry Hill? And by the way, you know that bitch Sio is walking us into a trap, don't you? And that was one weird family reunion too. Now I'm sure lots of folks would love to see that your daddy's alive again, but I'm not so sure seein' a living head, his nasty ass guts and shit, and what most folks ain't have in mind. I mean, how could he be alive, huh? Maybe it wasn't him. It's a trick. Maybe it was another robot, like that afro droid you killed awhile back. Or maybe like a muppet, you know like drawn by hand or somethin'. OK... Oh, oh, OK... That was stupid. It ain't doll. Whatever it was, one thing is for sure! That B-i-tch is craaazy! She must really hate you to do all these unnatural shit. And what's that with Kuma? Ain't he normally the crying and complaining type? Dude didn't say a damn word. Now that creeps me out. Something is wrong. And I don't like it. What you wanna do 'bout this kid who follow us? So you killed his Pops, now he probably tryin' to axe you. That sounds familiar, don't it? No sweatin', no sweatin', kid ain't gonna last much longer. He's been dragging behind us in this damn heat for days! He'll dead by morning. Sorry Daddy. I wish you three could've seen the look on his face when I showed him the living head of his own dead father. Never forget that it was Afro Samurai that made you what you are. He will live in hell on Earth, for what he's done to us. You will enjoy every second of excruciating agony that I'll inflict upon him. You'll watch as he bleeds from his very pores. Listen to the sound of his breaking bones. Smell his fear and his burning flesh. His death will be so filled with horror, it will pass into legend. And I too, as his legendary executioner. Mountain climbing? What joke is this man? We ain't got no equipment, I need a smooth drink. You got a rope? You sure we're goin' the right way? Askin' thin' Afro. I think I'm holdin' down man. At least I'll have a stroke. You're stressin' me out. I hate heights. Is this the mean spot? Damn! I've been back in the day, this place was sweet. It's like a messed up ding? paw. Been here candy corn, funk hates, some mean ass coasters. The whacks. Ain't nobody home now, tho'. What happened to them man? Shame it's all in ruins. Who did this? You sure this is the place that chick's ass should be waitin' for you? Wow, check it out, that's Justice. You know you never did ask for no directions 'long the way. Now, who is this? Hmm, costume party? Welcome Committee? Comedy troup? Thanks, but no thanks. We've gotta get to a meeting, OK? Let's see, ummm... YO! Funny Face. You seen a crazy sexy bitch with a Teddybear-headed dude around here? There ain't no blood. I might gonna die here. Daaaamn... Lady Sio is not here. You remember us do you, Afro Samurai? Who would've imagine that the boy we once knew, would return as such a mad executioner. Driven only by his murderous rage, to bring death and chaos to the world. Draw your sword, Afro Samurai. Now you die. Well hello, my lady. Please rejoice, the restoration of Afro's father is in the final stage. However, this stage is very sensitive, and if the slightest error occurs, we still could lose everything. They are gone. What's this? They'd never undertake anything without my orders. What've you done? Perhaps they went into town. What do you mean? Or... Perhaps they challenged Afro Samurai without you. But don't fear. Who knows they might just win. After all, you might be surprised to hear that thay all have quite an impressive area of gadgets, engineered in their bodies. Not to mention the special drug injection into all. Lady Sio? What sport is this? What a hasty princess we have here. Regeneration is not yet... You did such a splendid job, dear Professor. You got all the prayers, all the right gratifications I owe my thanks. Now, it is time for you to make a well deserved break. Good night, Professor! The other executioner is about to awake. No matter your intentions, there are things that we cannot allow you to do. We must not allow our lady Sio to thread the path of darkness. Such a sweet lady she is. We will not allow to fall from grace. Instead, we will be the sinners. All I wanted was for Afro to see the town he destroyed. I wanted him to see the consequences of his sins, before I slit his throat. But now my vassals are most likely dead. Fools rush in, where angels fear to thread. Michael, shoot him now! What are you waiting for? Do it! Shoot 'em. She is dead already. Do it for our lady Sio. I knew that sooner or later, this day would come. I will die with you. Afro, you made it! How'd you survive, old boy? Tell me what I missed? You know I get hit, by sweepin' God, I'm hurt too. But I'm tough! So I'm worth! You whacked them crazy muth'fuckers? Follow me, son. Holy fuck! Now, I have officially seen it all. Why you got to walk directly into every trap? You stupid or what? Up there is the crazy bitch who've been pullin' the strings this whole time. And your own revived robo pal, who don't like your ass neither! On the top of that, we've fallen for some freak of nature, you think is your Dad! That is my real father! Wrong answer, that's it! You're an idiot. And this is far as I go. See ya! I'm so happy that you made it. We've so much to talk about I have come for my father, and NO.1 headband. What a surprise! But what can you possibly do, with your body so utterly destroyed? We gonna torture you. Death will come slowly. Why didn't you wear the NO.1 headband? I just wanted revenge for you. Whatever your reason, one must shoulder the burden of destiny that instantly puts 'em on the headband. You should know that by now. Become The NO.1! You can never escape the cycle of blood! The NO.1 kills or is killed! You don't have the luxury to choose whose blood you spill. Take back your headband, fear not, my son. Father, wait! Father! Oh look, look my dear brother. Afro Samurai is about to meet his end, just as I planned. At the hands of his own father. He'll finally pay for the pain he caused us, for the pain he caused to thousands like us. Kill him! Kill him once and for all! Kill him Afro, waste him! He ain't your real father! That's it! Finish him, do it! I do not kill my father. Then this is the end of Afro! Did you see that Jinno? We did it! We finally brought him to justice. And it was we, we who killed him. Look, look my dear brother. What have you done? What have you done to Afro?! Why are you protecting Afro?! He is dead now! It's no use! Have you forgotten what Afro did to us? Do you? My dearest... Brother... I must protect swordmaster's dojo. Musr protect everyone. Including my brother, Afro! I love you, my Jinno. My brother. It's been a long time. Hasn't it Sio? How have you been, princess? Run Afro, you can't win! I said run dammit! You can't win this one! He's too strong! He ain't human! Don't! Dooon't! Shut... Up! It'll soon be over! Forgive me, but you're not my father. My father died a long time ago. Fear not! Father... Anytime you're ready! Does it ever end? I guess not. From the look on your face, I'd say you had a hell of a rough day! You knew this, didn't you?! You knew it'll happen again. I knew it, Afro Samurai. But I won't say nothing. Anymore. But you know, don't turn your back. That's the only choice you have left. I've been waiting a long time for you!
