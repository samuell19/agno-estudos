[Clark grunting] [creature snarling] [Clark panting] [grunting] Where am I? And what am I wearing? [Yang] Ruby, you got it? Got it! Uh... Why does it look like that? [Clark] What are those things? Grimm! Hmm? [effort grunting] Are you okay? Anything hurt? [Yang] Shoot! Since when can Grimm shoot laser beams? Be right back, new kid! [chuckles] I don't think I'm in Kansas anymore. [Grimm screeching] Whoa... [exclaims] Welp, that didn't work. [Clark] I'll take care of it! Hmm. [exclaims] Huh? Uh... [Clark grunting] [Ruby] Uh... Are you all right? I'm usually much stronger than this. They're headed for Beacon! [Grimms screeching] Beacon? It's our school. Or... it was? Uh... What's your semblance? Uh... You know, like, your... special power? I know what it is where I'm from. Here... only one way to find out. Hmm. [heroic music playing] Huh? [Clark grunting] [impact grunts] [straining] Huh? Something's messed with my powers! [Ruby] Don't worry, I got you! By the way, I'm Ruby! And that's my sister, Yang! [grunts] [chuckles] [impact grunts] I'm fine. Got any special tricks to beating monsters on your world? -"Your world"? -[Clark grunts] [Ruby grunting] Duck! [screeching] Uh... Thanks for that. [sighs] That was nothing. I should be able to do more with my... What did you call it? Semblance? It looks like Earth's sun. Except it feels... different. Earth is... your world? Because you're from a different world. Because that's a thing. Well that would explain... a few things. -Um... -[Yang] What's your name, kid? [chuckles] Just call me... Superman. -Yeah... no. -Ugh! [Ruby] Do you have a, uh, regular name? Uh... Yeah. Just... Just call me Clark. Where am I? [Ruby] This... is Remnant. [Yang] So... how did you get here, Clark? I don't remember anything. Just images... I was fighting something with my friends... as an adult? Are you sure you didn't hit your head? Something is wrong. These Grimm... You said they don't shoot lasers? Not usually. But they also don't usually absorb all the dust we shoot at them. [sighs] It's my fault. I messed up your world by being here. I have to fix it. [Ruby] Whenever anything gets... weird, you can bet there's one person who knows what's going on. Ozpin. [liquid pouring] Sorry, Mom. What did you say? I was asking how your studies have been. I worry about you. What you and your friends are doing... You are all just children. [Blake] But I'm not a child, Mom. I haven't been one for a while. That's exactly what worries me. I'm glad you're on break from Beacon. But you and your friends... you're against so much danger. I'll always come back to you, Mom. [footsteps approaching] Rolf? What's going on? Chieftain Ghira has us on high alert since Sienna Khan's death. Sienna? But... That... I was once a member of the White Fang. [Rolf] The guards down at the docks were doing the rounds and found a suspicious character. Has she said anything? [Diana] She... has some questions. [Blake] Impressive. How's this for an answer? [Diana] I don't want to cause harm. I just asked to be taken to their leader. Are you a Faunus? -Uh... -You know... Faunus. Humans with, like, a tail or wings or... Who are you? I am Diana, Princess of the Amazons... Can you help me? [Blake] A princess. From another world. And no memory of how you got here? I see flashes. In them, I'm an adult but I don't feel like that. I feel like I'm 16. [Blake] That doesn't make any sense. [scoffs] No kidding. What I do know is... the longer I'm away from my world, the more people will get hurt. I have to return. Maybe my team can help you. Let me call Yang. Blake, the CCT at Atlas has been down for a while, don't you remember? I... I don't. In that case, we go to Beacon. I don't know what any of those words mean. The CCT is our Cross Continental Transmit System, it's how the kingdoms of our world communicate. But if that's not working, then Ozpin is our next best option. Why isn't the CCT fixed yet? What are they doing, having a party? [Weiss] I can't believe you're having a party. Father, you're acting like it doesn't matter that the communication system is down! [sighs] Weiss, you can handle being away from your friends for a few months. You know something is wrong but, as usual, you won't sacrifice the dust needed to help people! It's not my job to fix the CCT. [exclaims] -If not us, then who? -[gasps] Uh... -Uh, what was I saying before? -Ugh! Did you see the size of that suit? Yes. -[Weiss grunts] -[digital beeping] Wha-- Someone's disappointed this isn't a costume party. [Bruce] "Nero fiddled while Rome burned." [Weiss] Uh... [Bruce] I saw your outburst with your dad. Can't say I blame you. The rich are the same in every universe, chronically ignorant to the plights of others. [scoffs] I'm not one for parties, either. I usually try to find some secret room to hole up in. -You ever tried it? -[Weiss] Mm... a dust lab wouldn't be at the top of my preferred hiding places. Dust? Huh. Like specific dust, or just... general dust? Schnees deal in general dust. Can't allow ourselves to limit the natural energy sources we can use. Of course. Because dust is an energy source. Right. I thought I knew all the upper class families. At least the ones that have access to labs. I'm from a little further out. Mistral? Vacuo? Sure. Long way from home. Bruce. Bruce Wayne. Ever been to Mistral? [grunts] Hey, you can hide out back in the cargo hold. I'm not sure. [Bruce] What do you remember? We are friends. Family. Mm, Bruce Wayne, you said? Thief! Someone stole my lab key! [Weiss groans] I did tell you I liked to hide in secret rooms at parties. Weiss. Wait! I need your help. I don't help common thieves. Something is wrong and I think I may know what it is. Your memories. You're having a hard time connecting to them. They're like soup in your brain, right? [indistinct chatter] Please. We'll find them, sir. [Weiss] Here's your thief! Weiss, listen! I'm not from Vacuo! Or Mistral! Or from Remnant at all! I have to get to a lab to figure out -what brought me here so I can go back! -[man grunts] [impact grunts] -[yells] -[crowd gasps] [cracking knuckles] [plays piano] [vibrato intensifying] [grunts] [grunts] [straining] -[effort grunts] -[glass cracking] [all exclaiming] Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's new. [woman gasps] A Faunus! [Bruce grunts] Whoa! Oh, come on! How does Clark do this? [thuds] -Ugh! -[crowd exclaims] He must work for the White Fang. But a terrorist organization will not scare the Schnees. Take him away. White Fang? Weiss, you know I'm right! You know we're out of place! [intense music playing] [Ruby panting] How are you not tired? [panting] We ran the whole way! Yeah. I guess it's my semblance? As long as I'm not in the shade. You said it's the... The physical... something of my something? Physical manifestation of your aura. Auras. Right. Basically, your soul. Got it. I think. Does this place feel sort of... empty to you guys? We didn't run into anyone on the way here. You're right, but Ozpin will have the answers. He always does. [elevator dings] [Blake] Yang? [Yang] Blake! You got pulled into this weirdness, too? Guess we all had the same idea. -Wonder Woman? -Superman! Superman? Yeah, we just call him Clark. [Clark] This is my friend, Diana. Diana, this is Ruby and Yang. [Diana] And this is Blake. Do we know if the others are here? You're the first familiar face that I've seen. Well, [scoffs] mostly familiar. We weren't teenagers before this, right? Well, uh, what do you remember? Just... [exclaims] flashes. We were fighting something. Something... mechanical. And big. That's all I remember since waking up in Menagerie. Wait. You were in Menagerie? Isn't that, like, a long trip? When did you guys get to Beacon? It felt like we set out this morning. So, here I am. A criminal hiding in plain view. All with the help of a little black... [gasps] This is... This is all wrong. [eerie music playing] [both gasp] Beacon... It fell. Guys... this isn't right. That could explain why we're teens. Maybe... Did we do this? [elevator dings] Students! Ozpin? Do you know what's going on? The Grimm are acting really weird! They shoot lasers! You shouldn't be here. [Ruby] Professor Ozpin? Is that you? Neither should you. [Clark] Uh, is changing into a small boy his semblance? [all three gasp] [Blake] No, I... I don't think so. Ozpin died. Then reincarnated as Oscar. Tell us what's going on? Where are our friends? Whoo... She is... [clears throat] very strong. And? Just an observation. [Diana gasps] But you were just... [Ozpin] You five should be in training. There's been a report of Grimm on the edge of town. Come with me. [Blake] That was weird. [Diana] Should we follow him? [Ruby] We need to get things back to normal as soon as possible. [Diana] Hmm. Hmm? Oh. Ah. [Jessica] Uh... [Glynda] Miss Cruz? So, our aura-soul thing controls our semblance-power thing. Right? Correct. More or less. What if we can't connect to our semblance? It may take some time, but you'll get there. Now, who can tell me about the different kinds of dust? [exhales] There are a bunch of different colors. They're in all the weapons. Yes. But, what color dust coordinates with which energy source? Red, fire. Yellow, electricity. et cetera, et cetera. [sniffing] Something smells different. And how did you know all that? [chuckles] You'd know the answers, too, if you paid attention. Hmm... I don't know. [sighs] Why are we learning kids' stuff? -Beats me. -This is weird, right? It feels like something's off. Something's definitely sideways. The tech here feels weird. Hollow. You've adjusted quickly. Just a little while ago you were freaking out. What, you haven't learned how to adapt -thanks to childhood trauma? -[Nora snickers] [clears throat] Well, it seems you all have more important things to talk about than your lessons. In that case... [grunts] [Barry laughs boisterously] [grunts] [Barry continues laughing] [Nora grunting] [Victor] Sorry, Nora! Mari, use your power! Oh! Do you mean my semblance or my dust? I'm still not sure what the difference is. [groaning] My necklace is gone, remember? Hey, Jessica, how you doing? [Jessica grunting] Come on... Come on! She's been better. [grunts] Here, use my machine! [Mari] I don't want to use your machine, I want to use my necklace to summon eagle's flight! Hyah! Oh. Ha-ha! [groans] [chuckles] Huh? [groans] Barry! He's fine. [Barry grunts] He's in pain! [groans] Could really use Superman right about now. [Clark] Come on, guys. Voted for Homecoming King yet? [Jessica chuckles] [Nora] Uh... Remember, students, that there are Grimm in the forest. This is really freaking me out. It's like he's not really here. Any idea what happened to him? My mom said some weird stuff, too. I didn't think anything of it, but-- What is going on? [Jaune] Wha-- Hey! Where did Ozpin go? Or, wait, was it Oscar? No, that's wrong, right? Oscar isn't old enough to look like Ozpin. I think. How old is he? In normal years or possessed- by-an-ancient-immortal years? -Is that like dog years? -[Ren sighs] That must be them. [laughing] Yes! -Uh... -Vixen! [Mari] I'm so happy to see you two. Ugh. I hated being a teen the first time around. -[Clark] How long have you been here? -Uh... Three days? No. This morning? It's hard to tell. You? I feel like it's only been since this morning. I just want to get back home. And back to normal. We've made some friends who should be able to help. Justice League, meet Ruby, Yang, and Blake. [Ruby] And these are our friends. Jaune, Nora and Ren. -Oh. So, we don't have to kill them? -Mm. I'd like to see you try. I would not! Nobody needs to do any killing. So, you guys aren't from here either? Well, from what Diana and I have pieced together, we were fighting some large mech... with no memory of anything until showing up here. [chuckles] Well, that's a dead end then, right? Flash and I have been trying to remember so we can figure out how to send ourselves back. The tech here hasn't been particularly helpful. Brainiac? Maybe Vandal Savage, if it's a time travel thing? What about that one guy... um... Kilg%re? That the lunatic who wants to take over the world? You said it before, Kilg%re is a delusional electrical wire short of a full panel. But is the question: who did this? Or is it: why are we someplace called Remnant? If this really is Remnant. We'll find out. But we aren't all together yet. Mm. Where's Batman? [wings flapping] [sighs] [cracking bones] [effort grunts] Wow. [dramatic music playing] [snickers] Hmm? [grunts] [electrical buzzing] [straining] Okay. Too much too fast. Noted. -[Weiss] So... -Huh? I take it the bat costume was yours? You believe me. I did some digging around, and I think you're onto something. About your memories fraying? How do you know that? A hunch. If I can get a look at what makes up your world and your dust, I might be able to figure out what's going on. That's what I was trying to do at the party. [Weiss] Ah, yes. Stealing the keys to the lab. There are easier ways to break in, you know. Hmm. Or out. [spits] [electricity crackling] [power down] I was waiting for you. I had a feeling you'd want answers, too. Ugh. The lab is this way. [chuckles] [Diana] Where could he be? Sorry, I can't believe you have a teammate named Bat Man. Now is that better or worse than a teammate named Superman? -[Barry] Right? -[Diana] Focus. He could be anywhere. And Remnant is a big place. Yang and I found Clark. Diana woke up on Menagerie near Blake. And the rest, well-- They were in the dorms next to ours. We only noticed when we heard Jessica crying. [Jessica groaning] I wasn't crying! Hey, it's okay. [whispering] You were a little though. I was trying to find my ring! Yeah, and my necklace is gone, too. -So, we've all been dropped near members of your teams... -[Blake] Huh? Has anyone heard from Weiss? [Ruby] I tried calling her, but there was no answer-- [Yang] Communication isn't working. [Diana] Do you think that's connected? [Clark] What runs the communication system? [Ruby] Dust. It runs everything. The Grimm we saw in the forest was absorbing it. -Do you think it could be using dust for its energy? -[Barry exclaims] Batman would know. Where would Weiss be? Well, if Blake was in Menagerie and Yang and I were in the woods by Beacon, then Weiss might be in Atlas. [Jessica] You probably don't need me, right? Jessica, what's going on? I've been trying to tap into my semblance thing this whole time, but I need my ring. It's got to be on this world somewhere. -[sighs] Jessica, we don't have time to-- -[Ruby] Ring? A bright green with a weird design? I've seen it. It's in Ozpin's office. -Why don't we-- -[Pyrrha] Jaune? Jaune? Jaune? [Ren] Jaune? [Clark] There are 12 of us. We don't all need to go looking for Bruce. Okay, so Lantern can go get her ring back while we look for Batman. -What? -Well, we could-- Hold on. I'm not following someone into battle who's never been on Remnant before. Me neither. You can't just barge into our world like you know what you're doing. Sorry. They do this. Blondie has a point. Their world, their rules. Even if their rules involve figuring out this semblance thing. Hey, all right, even those of us that are from here can have a hard time with it. There's another thing we haven't talked about. The Grimm in the forest. We've fought monsters before. I don't know what you have on your world, but Grimm... they're soulless creatures with only one purpose: to destroy humanity. I've never seen anything like them before. We need to figure out how to get back, now. I think we all need to-- We aren't going without Bruce. -Why are you calling the shots? -No wait-- I need to get my ring. We should be able to-- Hey! We should split up. One group goes with Jessica to get her ring back, one group looks for Bruce, the rest of us are going to check out these weird Grimm. They might shed some light on what's going on. Or at least, how to get back. [sighs] That's exactly what I was trying to say. I'll head to the forest. I'll take Diana to Atlas. [Blake] Uh, me, too. [chuckles awkwardly] I'll go with Ruby to track down Grimm. All right, sticking with you, Blue Boy. [Nora] I'll go, too. If there's Grimm to smash, I want to smash them! Cyborg, want to stay behind with Lantern? Hack into their computers? Eh, I already tried that. No luck. Just some weird numbers over and over again. I volunteer for the creepy monster mission -in the woods with Nora! -[sighs] Me, too. Um... I... [sighs heavily] I don't want to go alone. I'll go with you. Vixen? Ah, why not? Always love following you into certain death, Supes. [Clark chuckles softly] Good luck, everyone. [Weiss] So, your home is called Gotham? And on your world, you're an adult? I don't... The evidence suggests that was the case. But I feel like I'm a teenager. It's weird. I didn't have the chance to be a teen before. I don't like it. So, uh, where's this lab? [Weiss] Just around here. -[gasps] -[Grimms growling] -Grimm. -They don't look very friendly. The lab. It should be right there. -I'll distract them, you-- -Wait. [Weiss] Are you really telling me how to fight Grimm? [Bruce] They're illusions. [Weiss] This isn't your world. The lab's behind them, hidden. Someone doesn't want us getting in there. Well, have I got news for them. [Grimms growling] [intense music playing] [Weiss] Figure out how to shut them down! [growls] Weiss! Stop using the dust! -They're feeding off of it! -Huh? [effort grunts] [grunts] I thought you said they were illusions! They're good illusions! Deadly illusions. Got it. -[beeps] -[grunts] [Bruce panting] [exclaims] Any luck with the door? There's an electrical current preventing anyone from getting in. I found a weakness, but I need something small enough to cut through. Hmm. [growls] Hurry! Huh? [growls loudly] [exhales in relief] [Weiss clears throat] You know, it's a shame you're not from Remnant. It feels like you belong. [Mari exclaims] I feel ridiculous. [chuckles] What? You don't like being back in high school? [Mari] I don't like having an actual tail. Oh, come on. It suits you! [Mari] Well, you're not the one who keeps sitting on it. Can I help you with something? I've noticed you're really great with weapons. And since we aren't around a lot of electronics out here, I was thinking... I might not be a lot of help. Could you show me a couple tricks? [Ren] We're all a little busy here. Ren, I can answer for myself. No, Nora, [stammers] I know, but-- And I thought this was going to be a boring monster hunt. [Barry grunts] Ooh! Sorry about that. -Hey, man, I'm not trying to-- -Not trying to what? You know, this is the most you've said to me this whole time. I don't say much to anyone! Guys... Look I already work with a strong, silent type that looks down on everyone. And you're no Batman. Okay, everyone, calm down. And you're not my dad. Well, you're acting like a kid. No, I'm not. I'm trying to figure out how to avoid certain doom. That's not what kids do. That's what we do. We have to protect everyone. And take care of each other. And who are you, pipsqueak? -[Nora] Hey! -[Mari] Cyborg! I... [stammers] Yeah. That sucked. I know. I just hate not feeling... useful. I'm gonna... scout. Clear my head. You okay? I've been doing this leader thing for a while now and... And sometimes it's... [sighs] Sometimes it's just so... [Barry and Mari grunting] [Barry laughing] I know what you mean. Like, everything you do is the end of the world. And nothing can stop it. Just so you know, that doesn't go away. Even when you're a grown-up. [laughs] Ah, I'm sorry, it's... It's hard to take you seriously when you're Yang's age. Yeah. [Victor] Uh... Hey, we have a problem! [metal clanking] [Jessica] Hmm. Find anything? She said it was on the desk, but I've looked over the whole thing. Twice. Oh, this would be so much easier if I actually had my ring. I could just scan the desk. [Jaune exclaims] This piece of jewelry is really important to you, huh? [Jessica angrily] Oh, it's not just a piece of jewelry. It's... It's my strength, it's the thing that keeps me together, and without it... Without it... Hey, hey! I'm sorry. I didn't know. Do you think that's why you haven't been able to access your semblance? [Jessica grunting] [panting] [Jaune] I've been there. How'd you access it? Uh... A friend believed in me. That's all? [Jaune] Try it out. [sighs] Fine. [Jaune] Doing floor time. Cool. It's also okay if it doesn't happen. What? You said you believed in me! I do, Jessica, but you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself. You're no less of a person if you can't. -[Jaune] [distorted] Jessica? -What? [Jaune] Did it work? [Jessica panting] My ring? I can hear you. Did I go anywhere? [in normal voice] No, you're still on the floor. -What's going on? -I... I don't know. I... It's a white room. No windows. No doors. And I can't get out. I... I don't like being trapped. What? What is that? It feels different. It's my semblance. I help enhance... whatever yours is. Try again. Ugh, I can't. I have the ring, but it's not working! Okay. Talk to me about it. What does it feel like when it works? [Jessica exhales] I used to... I used to not want it. I didn't feel like I deserved it. It's a symbol of power on my world, but it's also supposed to be a symbol of belonging. And I always wanted to belong, so badly, to fit into my skin. And yet here I was, forever different than my friends. Because the ring brought experiences that they could never imagine, that they'll never have to live through, but... But I never want them to live through. But at least, with the ring, I always felt like I had control. I could construct whatever I wanted, whatever I could imagine, even if everything was out of my hands. And somehow in the in-between, everything got all quiet. I could find myself. [Jaune] Oh, you changed the room! [Jessica panting] What are you doing here? This was Ozpin's office, but now it's that white space! Or we were never in Ozpin's office. Or on Remnant at all. [Jaune] This is where we've been all along. Your ring, it... It sounds like it gets to the truth of things. The truth of you. I bet... I bet that's what your semblance does, too. With or without the ring. We aren't in your world! Or mine! This is all an illusion! Ugh! There's no door! I can't get out! Unless that's an illusion, too. And if this guy's an illusion... [Jessica] What are you doing? [Jaune] Hold on! [grunting] Jessica, is it-- [Jaune straining] Stop... Stop... Pyrrha! -Stop... Stop... -[effort grunting] Okay... [coughing] that definitely felt like real pain. We have to tell the others. If we are in an illusion, then we were all brought here by someone that can transfer our consciousness. And whoever brought us here... must be controlling this place. [sighs] [grunting] [groans] Ow! [Yang giggling] So... How's it going? Just swell. It's different than home. There, I don't have to imagine gauntlets to fly, or a lasso for strength. Those are powers you have on your world? And they just... happen? [Diana] They come from different places. Mine are a gift from the gods. Superman's come from the sun, more or less. Each of us learned how to save the world on our own. At least you guys learned together. Who's flying the ship? Autopilot. I set the proximity alert for when we get near Atlas. What about Grimm? Can they fly? Some can. The alert will sound for them, too. Grimm are attracted to negative emotions, and something tells me we might have a lot of those right now. [Diana] You have to stay focused. All the time. Hmm. Just about. [Yang] Everything okay? It's nice here. With you guys. I like my team. I really do. But... they don't understand. That happens with teams. Yang and I didn't exactly get along at first. But now... No. I grew up like a warrior. On an island with other warriors. We trained together, fought together. Like us. Yeah. But my teammates, they... They didn't grow up like I did. They don't always understand what being a warrior means. [Blake] They sound lucky. They've never had to worry they were going to die just from going to school. To train like your life or, worse, your friends' lives depend on it. To have to live with the fact that there's a real chance you're going to lose them. They had a childhood. Blake... -[loud thud] -[all grunting] [alarm blaring] What was that? [Blake] Grimm! Let's see what they're after. Yang, open the hatch! Are you really doing what I think you're doing? You heard Diana, we're warriors! [vibrato intensifying] Whoa. Okay! Easy. Easy. All right. [grunts] Blake! [gasps] [Blake] It's absorbing the dust! [exclaims] [Blake grunting] Pitch the ship! Trust me! [breathing deeply] [grunts] [Blake grunting] [Grimm screeching] [Blake] Nice job! We're still in the school? [panting] Jaune... Trapped! We're trapped! [Pyrrha] Jaune? Ugh! Who could be doing this to us? -[Pyrrha] Jaune? -[Jaune] Shh. [Pyrrha] Is that you? [Jaune] Do you hear her? Jaune, someone is controlling this space. Whatever you're hearing... It's not real. Of course it's not real. She's gone. [Pyrrha] Really, Jaune? -[Jessica] She? -You can't be here. [Jessica] Who do you think you're hearing? I know this isn't real. I saw the white room. I could really use a dose of reality right now, Jess. Can you take control of this hallway? I'm trying-- I... [grunts in frustration] I... [Pyrrha] Let me. I can help. Just ask. Fine! Pyrrha, help us! What was that? [Grimm roaring] You guys have dragons? Not normally! And it's a Wyvern! Uh... So... what do we do? [Ruby] We fight! You heard her. Ah! [Mari grunts] -Thanks. -Don't mention it. [Clark groans] Clark! Nora! -[Victor] I've got her! -[grunts] I can take care of myself! I'm okay. See what's up with Barry. Anyone see what happened to Flash? Wait, what happened-- Pay attention! Flash? Flash! He's hurt! Do Grimm carry poison? Not this one! What's going on with him? I don't know! It's like he went down as soon as we started attacking the dragon! Ruby! How do we stop this thing before it hurts anyone else? I... The last time I fought it I-- Ruby? Something's not right. It doesn't feel like a normal Grimm. Okay, plan B. Nora and Cyborg! You create an electrical charge strong enough that Nora can absorb it and take this thing down. We'll clear a path! Hey, before. I didn't mean you couldn't take care of yourself. That's not-- -Hold my hand. -What? [growling] [Clark grunting] Count of three. One... two... -three! -Three! Good job, you guys. I'm sorry that I just... I-- Uh, that's not supposed to happen. This lab... it has everything. [Weiss] More than normal. It isn't usually set up like a command center. [Bruce] So the Grimm are feeding off energy like it's their personal power source and they protect this place that's not normally set up like a command center. But why? There. That should show us when the energy vampire Grimm show up. How'd you manage that? The Grimm outside lent a hand. It's strange. Usually Grimm completely dissolve when they're killed. Something's changed the rules. Hmm. [sighs] With any luck, my friends are fighting against one of these Grimm and we'll be able to track them down. What makes you think there's anyone else from our worlds here? Maybe it's just you and me. You know, if you can't find your way back, you could always stay on my world. You could belong in Remnant. Another dead end. [Jaune] Wow, it looks... -[door closes] -...just like I remember it. I didn't realize how much I missed this place. How much it... -reminds me of-- -[Pyrrha] Jaune? Jaune. What? Pyrrha, you can't... You can't be here. You're not real, none of this is real. I am real, Jaune. I promise. I will explain everything, but we've got to go. [Jessica] Jaune, we need to tell our teams what we've found. Pyrrha... She's been helping this whole time! I've heard her over and over, and then she showed us the door when I called her! [exclaims] But-- You can't use your power, right? So... what are our other options? Okay. Let's go. [Pyrrha] Follow me. There's a shortcut we can take. Hurry! Your friends are in danger! You're... You're not coming with us? [Jessica gasps] [robotic voice] You cannot be allowed to tell the Justice League. Pyrrha? Pyrrha, no! Pyrrha! [intense music playing] [grunting] [Grimms screeching] Huh? [startles] [Clark] You sure nothing like this happened before? Is your memory glitching? I think we would remember if we'd seen a Grimm reboot, let alone split into a whole other Grimm! [Nora yelling] [roars] [Ruby] Good job, Nora! What now, Ruby? Right, uh... Now, uh now... See if anything that we've thrown at the Wyvern has slowed it down at all! You're not the boss of us. We aren't kids. You are kids! So are you. Ruby, I don't mean to overstep, but I've had experiences leading a team. -So have I! -Clearly not enough. -[sighs] Ruby, I-- -I had it. You just had to give me a minute-- Sometimes you don't have a minute! It's my fault that we're here. I think I froze. And my team... We're stuck here because of me. Watch out! [Clark] Flash. Flash! [Ruby] Are you okay? [grunts] I don't know what's wrong with me. I do know I'm not much use to you guys. We need to talk. [Mari] Nora! -[straining] -[growls] [groans in pain] No! [Victor] The Grimm are swarming! [Clark] Ruby! Lookout! Why aren't you working? [Bruce] Weiss, look at this. There's a program that's running on your communication system. [Weiss] Think that's why it's not working? Huh? I've seen that sequence before. I saw it when I was trying to track the rest of my team. I didn't think anything of it, but-- [Bruce] It's on every system. It's the only program running. Which means if we can alter it... We'll be able to take control of whatever this is. -[rumbling] -[Weiss gasps] Hmm. -[both] Huh? -[Grimms growling] These guys again? Don't use dust! What am I supposed to do, spit on them? Hmm. [intense music playing] [growls] Ah! [impact grunts] Bruce! [Bruce] There are too many of them! Hmm? [grunting] [Bruce panting] -[Bruce exhales] -[Diana] So... what'd I miss? [Jaune] Help us! Please! Pyrrha! [Jessica] She wasn't real, Jaune. You know that. None of this is real. And now... we're gonna die. [Jaune] Gah! I shouldn't have trusted her. I'm sorry. [Jessica] She seemed important to you. She is. Was. [Jessica] I'm sorry you lost her. [Jaune] It was a long time ago. [Jessica] Time is only one part of grief. [rumbling] Jaune, the walls. I see them. Jaune! [breathing heavily] Jaune! You can get us out of this. No. No, I can't! I can't tap into my power here. I thought I was over my anxiety, I... I thought I had dealt with it! Hey! Sometimes there are flare-ups. It's normal to be afraid. But you're more than your fear. You are more than that ring! [Blake] Run that by us one more time? And speak slowly. Imagine that it's been a long day and I am very tired. [sighs] We aren't on Remnant. Or their world. We're... somewhere else. Well, that explains my mom. And Ozpin. They're not... real. They're like broken memories. -[Weiss] My dad, too. -Batman? -[Weiss] We found a sequence. -Bruce? [Blake] This is Diana. She's... I didn't think anyone else was here. ...his teammate. But you probably picked up on that. You look... different. This place is so strange. I just want to go home. You could still come with us. -To Remnant. -[chuckling] I... I'm sorry, what did you just say? Diana, this is Weiss. Hi, Weiss, it's nice to meet you. I've heard great things about you. Bruce, their world isn't your home. We should probably get back to the others. I have powers on their world, Diana. I never wanted powers. I didn't think I needed them. But on Remnant, I can help. More than I could before. But you do help. You help on Earth. You have your own kind of powers-- Maybe with these abilities, I can do more. I can be like you. A warrior. -[computer beeping] -[Weiss] Finally! [Bruce] You figure out the sequence? [Weiss] No. But I have figured out a way to track down these weird dust-eating Grimm. I've been trying to work around the CCT. It's like something shut their whole system down just to run their sequence and prevent us from contacting each other. -But I think I've finally-- -[beeps] [Yang] A Wyvern and a Leviathan. They'll be killed. We have to go. Right now. [Jaune grunting] I know you can do this! I know you can get us out of this, Jessica! You have to fight this. For them! For myself. [heroic music playing] In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight! Let those who worship evil's might, beware my power... Green Lantern's light! [echoes] [Ruby grunting] How's everyone doing? Finally getting the hang of this place! [gasps] [growls] Everyone else? Well, could use a coffee break. Ice cream? Caffeine IV -- Is... Is that-- [Ren] Running out of steam. The Wyvern seem unlimited in created Grimm. [Victor] Is this what Grimm are normally like? I mean, they seem weird. [Ren] How's Nora? Let's finish this fight first. Looks like you guys could use some help. -[Ruby gasps] Weiss! -Huh? [grunts] I'm okay, Ruby. It'll take more than a temporal displacement to keep me away from my team. Is that what this is? Where's Batman? [scoffs] Let's take these guys down. [grunting] [motor revving] [Jaune] Lantern! We've been trying to get to you! None of this is real! [Jessica] It's a virtual reality! [Victor] I knew it! So, who's doing it? [Bruce] I may have that answer. [Clark] Batman? So much cooler than I thought. It's good to see everyone. You have powers. Yeah. [chuckles] Got me some wings. As to who's doing this... Why don't you answer, Flash? That... That's why you smell different. Where is my ring? [Barry] Whoa. What are you talking about? Running this world would take a lot of energy, even with siphoning dust. And Flash... you've been running slow. Getting hurt. Because you're running one equation through all the computers on this world... Kilg%re! It makes sense. Every time we would get close to answers, there would be a new monster attack! [Ruby] He created all of this. What did you do to Barry? [laughing maniacally] He's in here. Safe and sound. Been fun to run around with you guys instead of from you for a change! You all think you're so smart, but you didn't think twice about what was going on with the Scarlet Speedster. It was so easy to trip you up and keep you guessing! You may think Brainiac or Vandal Savage are smarter than me, but I have done what they couldn't. I have trapped the Justice League! And us! Your plan doesn't make any sense. What kind of lame villain are you? That's it! You didn't do this on your own, did you, Kilg%re? Do you see anyone else here? I trapped you forever in this digital world. I used their precious dust to power it. Me, and no one else! [Bruce] Then why are you still here? That's why you've been running the sequence on all systems... [grunts] [Bruce] You're trapped, too! I gave him the idea to power this realm with dust from his world. This construct was useless without me! But I required no payment for my genius. [effort grunting] I simply asked to use this place. It was a perfect plan, bring my enemies into this world, transform them into teens so they would be at their most vulnerable, rife with hormones and insecurities, while I watch as this world ripped you apart! And he agreed, on the condition that I trap his enemies as well. I digitally transferred you all here and watched you struggle with all the emotions your adult selves ignore. Or repress. It's been said I am an electrical wire short of a full panel. But you all folded so easily. [Kilg%re laughing] You, especially. A child pretending to be a leader. [Kilg%re laughing wickedly] Delicious. Don't listen to him, Ruby. Leadership isn't about your age. It's about your heart. You will fail. You will freeze. But that's what makes you alive. [groans] [Clark] You don't have a way out of this world because whoever you worked with... they trapped you here. [Kilg%re groans] [exclaims] -[Weiss] Clark is right. -Huh? [Kilg%re grunts] I'd follow you into any battle. [Bruce] That's what you got wrong, Kilg%re. [impact grunts] That's what you don't get about humans. We're stronger together. Whoever helped you -tricked you into doing what they want. -[Mari grunts] [groans in pain] [Bruce] You're stuck with us. Weiss! [screams] Barry! Now! [Kilg%re screaming] [Barry grunting] [Barry panting] How did you know that Barry was awake in there? I didn't. Until I noticed... Morse code? And they call me a boy scout. [Ruby] How do we get rid of him? [Kilg%re] You can't! [Kilg%re laughing wickedly] [screeching] He flew into the Wyvern! Well, that was unexpected. [Kilg%re] I will destroy you! Vixen? Lantern? I think these belong to you. Glad I arrived just in time for the final battle. [Ruby] Let's go. [dramatic music playing] [Nora grunting] [Clark grunting] [Yang] We're outnumbered! We could stand a chance if we take down Kilg%re in the dragon! [both] Wyvern. Yeah, well, the last time we tried to take it down, it replicated. [Bruce] Because Kilg%re was with you. [Ruby] But now he's in it. And with Kilg%re controlling it, we're banging our head against a very angry, very gruesome wall! If someone could get us close enough, Jaune and I could deconstruct it! Take the Wyvern and Kilg%re apart! [screeching] I can try to open a path, but-- [Blake] There are too many Grimm. You got a plan, kid? [Kilg%re screaming] I just might. [heroic music playing] [heroic music playing] [Victor grunting] [yelling] [motor revving] Incoming! [Wyvern roaring] [Barry grunting] [Clark grunting] [Kilg%re] Pitiful! Think we gave them enough time? You got this, Lantern! She's right. So long as my friends believe in me. [Kilg%re] What are you doing? No. No! [screaming] No! Good work! Hmm. [Ruby] Hmm. Yeah. That's great and all, but where's Kilg%re? [Victor] Gone. His code isn't running through the world anymore. Things feel better now. We didn't completely destroy him? [Barry scoffs] We'll track him down on our world. [Weiss] I thought he was trapped with us. Well, turns out Jess has more power than she thought. [chuckles softly] That's great. But how do we get back home? [Bruce] I think I might have a way. [Diana] And then what? Are you going to go with them, or us? I'm a warrior. No matter what world I'm in. [keyboard clacking] [Victor] Hey, I... I wanted to... To say... thank you. To the both of you. I respect you. [digital beeps] [Bruce] There. That should do it. Go ahead, Cyborg. [Victor] It's been an honor. What he said. For me, too. You were right. It's hard to grow up under fire. I forget sometimes. I guess... I guess that's why we fight. It's not just because of how we grew up. It's so no one else has to grow up like us. And sometimes it's just nice to kick ass. [Bruce] Lantern, you're up. [Bruce] There it is. [Yang] Home. [Jessica] I don't know how long I can hold it. Let's go. I'm sure it was great meeting all of you. Sorry about the whole possession thing. So long, gang. If you're ever in the neighborhood, you know where to find us! You know you're still a kid, right? Even if it's at heart. Well, Ruby Rose, I don't think it's so bad being a kid. Age isn't what makes a good leader, right? Right. Thanks for the reminder. You're sure you got this? I got it. Thank you. -Likewise. -[Jessica straining] All right, guys. Not much longer. Come on, Weiss. [gasps] [breathing heavily] [Yang] Ruby? [Nora] Did anybody else just have a really weird experience? [Jaune groans] [Blake] It's, uh, coming back to me. That wasn't the training mission, was it? Someone created it. Someone from our world.
