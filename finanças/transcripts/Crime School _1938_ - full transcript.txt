Mom died about three years ago Dad's been dead a long time. You support your brother? Yes, sir. What do you do? I work in a factory downtown. Well, Frank, you're the leader of these boys, You ought to have sense enough to realize that if I don't find out who the guilty boy is, you're all going to suffer. Frankie, tell him. I ain't no stool, judge. That's a very poor code of honor, Frankie -- Obstructing justice. And you're all going to be punished because of what one boy did. Judge, would you let the others go ? if I told you who done it? If I told you who done it? It'd make it easier for them. Okay. It was me. I'm the one who hit him. Frankie, you didn't!

I'll get a new job soon, and I'll take him away to a better neighborhood, have more time to spend with him. give me a chance will you? I'm afraI'd it's too late for that, miss Warren. Too late? How can you say a thing like that? Maybe he's a little tough, but a kid's got to be tough in our neighborhood to stay alive. If you send him to reform school, I know what's gonna happen to him. He'll come out hard and mean and bitter. If you want to do something for these boys, why don't you clean up the slums? give them a decent place to live in. give them some of the things other boys have. give them a chance in life. Now, just a minute, miss Warren. It's true these boys haven't had the same advantages that other boys have had. But you can't blame it all on environment. Some of our greatest men have come out of those same tenements. They were men who, early in life, learned to respect the law. I don't like to put these boys away from their families, but I have no other course left to me. I'm sending you all to the state school for two years. All right boys. Frankie Don't worry sue. All right Frank. Oh, miss Warren. Yes? My name is Mark Braden. I'm in charge of holloway settlement house for the past few years, I'd like to talk to you about your brother.

That Warren kid's your troublemaker. We'll take care of him. Pick out your bunks. Hey, did he hurt you, Frankie? Boy, that was some sock. Never mind. He ain't gonna get away with it. What a joint this turned out to be. Yeah, I thought we was going someplace in the country. We should have brought our picnic lunches. No supper. What a place. Okay, red, take over. All right, break it up, you guys. You, go find yourself another bunk. Who do you think you are? When'd you blow in? Yeah, what do you want? You'll find out. Now, get to bed. Hey, you didn't come in with us. Yeah, what's the idea putting you in here? Every new draft gets an old-timer like me to wise them up to things. What did you fish get sent up for? I'll tell you if you won't squeal. We killed two guys with our bare hands. We're dynamite. Oh wise guys huh? We'll cool you down. Now, get your clothes off and get to bed. Hey, I'm hungry.

You ain't gonna whip me. Put that down! Put that down! Get him! Cooper, turn on the yard lights. Hey what's that? I don't know. Something's wrong. Look at the searchlight. hey, what's up, an av? Somebody's taking it on the lam. Yeah! Look, it's Frankie. Come on, Frankie! Get away! Run! Come on, Frankie. Go on, you can make it. Go ahead! A little more. He's caught on the barbed wire. Ow!

Cigar? No thank you. You a friend of the governor's, mr. Braden? As a matter of fact, I met the governor for the first time just a few days ago. We didn't expect you quite as soon as this, but we're glad you're here anyway. Tour of inspection? I suppose you'd call it that. Your first stop? Yes, it is. You couldn't have picked a better school to start, even if I say so myself. How long do are you with us? I don't know. Long enough to sort of check up and find out if everything's all right. Everything is all right, mr. Braden. ? My heart and soul is in this reformatory. I've been here for 12 years, and I'm proud of my record. We teach our boys the meaning of law and order. I think you'll find them the best-behaved group in the state. Well, shall we show you around? Why, yes, thank you. Assembly starts in a few minutes now, and you'll have a chance to look over the boys. They'll have a chance to see you. Pick up them pants. No belt came with them pants. That's too bad. How do you expect me to keep them up? You got hands, ain't ya? Pick 'em up. I wonder where Frankie is? I don't know. What do you think they did to him? He can take care of hisself. Maybe they beat him to death, huh? No talking in here. Hey, jojo, what happened to Frankie Warren? He didn't come back to his dormitory last night. Oh didn't he? Yeah, where is he? Why ain't he with us? He's having his breakfast in bed this morning. Yeah? In the hospital. Hospital? Pick 'em up! Come on, h.Urry it up if you want anything to eat.

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of america, and to the republic one nation indivisible with Liberty and justice for all. All right, Mr. Cooper. You. Step out of line. Cooper. So you're a comedian. No sir. Well, then, stop the clowning. I'm not clowning. These pants just won't stand up by themselves. They're too big for me. Oh. Well, then we'll have to fatten you up. Mr. Cooper, put this boy on a diet. You sure that isn't a little too severe, Morgan? We make the punishment fit the crI'me, Mr. Braden. Why not make the pants fit the boy? Very good. You have a sense of humor. Get back into the line. I'll excuse you this time, but get those pants fixed. All right Cooper. He's one of the new boys that came in last night. He hasn't been disciplined yet. I remember. I was present at the court hearing. Wait a minute. Isn't one of them missing? The Warren kid. Oh yes. Yes, he's a hard case, mr. Braden. He no sooner got in the dormitory last night than he began a fight. When I started to talk to him, he smashed a window and tried to escape. Oh. Where is he now? In the hospital. He got cut up a little bit on the barbed wire. Well, shall we continue our tour? Why, yes. You kids hurry up and finish up this hallway and stop loafing around. You got to keep a sharp eye on them, Mr. Braden. St ight down this way is the hospital. Of course, we may not have all the latest scientific equipment, but we do the best we can. This is the Warren boy, mr. Braden. Well hello son. I hear you had a little trouble last night. So what? Let's take a look at you. You guys keep your hands off me, see? Ain't gonna harass me around no more. Now, take it easy, kid. I'm not gonna hurt you. Get your hands off me! How'd you get these marks? How do you think? I had to punish him, Mr. Braden. You can't make a break like he did and get away with it. Otherwise, all the rest of them would try it. But those cuts haven't been treated. Something must be wrong. I sent him up here last night. Where's your doctor? Oh doc. Coming. Coming. Coming. Good morning. This is Mr. Braden, the new state commissioner. How do you do, sir? Why weren't his wounds taken care of? Well, I was kind of sick last night, Mr. Braden. In fact, I needed a doctor myself. He was pie-eyed. Dead drunk. You get an antiseptic and clean him up. Yes sir. I'll see that you're taken care of, kid. I'll take care of myself. Boy, I've been waiting for this. Wow! I hope this food don't taste as bad as it smells. kind of greasy, ain't it? P.U. Horse meat. Hey fellas look. I'm so hungry, I'm gonna take a chance. Where are you going? I ain't feeling so good. Sit down. Mind if I try some of this? Why uh ... Taking your life in your hands, mister. Quiet! That's rI'diculous. That's good, wholesome food, teeming with vitamins. Uh, we sit right up here, mr. Braden. Smells don't it? Vitamins. Do you hear that? That's what tmem things ? Are. Vitamins. That's worse than horse meat. What's your name? Brandon. What's your record? I was a police officer. You were dismissed from the force, weren't you? Yes, But I was framed. And mugged, too. Your name is Peterson, isn't it? Yes, sir. I suppose you were framed. What do you mean? This your picture and fingerprints? Why uh ... Where'd you get those? The police department. You deserted from the army, did time at leavenworth. Now you two men -- these two men are okay, mr. Braden. They've had schooling. You're a college man, aren't you, Cooper? Yes, sir. I'm sure you won't find any black marks against me. That's right. You see, gentlemen, I spent some time investigating your records before I came up here, so all this isn't much of a surprise to me. Now, you four men are fired. You'll get your full month's pay, but I want you to leave the grounds at once, understand? That's all. Good day. The rest of you men,' get back to your work. framed again. How do you do? I took care of the Warren boy, Mr. Braden, and did just as you told me. Now, you can rest assured that, under my watchful eye, he's gonna be fit as a fI'ddle. Now leave it to me. That won't be necessary, doctor. I didn't quite catch that. Come again. You're leaving here in exactly one hour. You're finished, so get your things and check out. You mean I'm fired? Just like that? Just like that. Why, the idea is rI'diculous -- preposterous. Why, do you realize that I'm Mr. Morgan's brother-in-law? Why you can't do -- can he fire me? He can. Are you going to allow him to do this to. Me, your own wife's brother? Why see here ... As a member of the medical profession, I protest. According to my records, you haven't been an accredited member of the medical profession for six years, doctor. Hitting the gin bottle and practicing medicine don't mix well together. Now get out. Now, listen, young fella, don't talk that way to me. I'm sorry, doctor. Wait till your wife hears! I'm gonna tell her. outside, doctor. Those guards you fired were valuable men. What do you want to do, replace them with a crew of schoolteachers? Maybe. You got things just a little twisted, Morgan. This is a school you're running and not a prison. You're dealing with kids, not hardened crI'minals. Your experience has been in settlement work, Mr. Braden. You'll find this is just a little bit different. You can't handle those boys with kid gloves. did you ever get beaten with a whip like that? Course not. I didn't think so. Would you like to try it sometime? What do you mean? Morgan, I've heard a lot about conditions up here lately, But I didn't realize they were quite this bad. I've seen enough since I've been here to convince me that the reason that 60% of your inmates turn out to be hardened criminals is because of the way you handle them. You can't feed them on your kind of diet and expect them to have respect for law and order. You want us to turn this place into a nursery, it's up to you. You're right, and while I'm doing it, I don't want any interference from you. You're fired along with all the rest of them. This, Mr. Morgan, is what we call a clean sweep. Mr. Braden, I may lose my job for talking out of turn, but you're absolutely right. The trouble with this institution is it's 50 years behind the times. I'm with you from the start. Well thanks Cooper. You meet me in the yard in half an hour. Yes sir. I'm locking this up for safekeeping. Doing a turnabout Cooper? What kind of a game do you call this? I'm being smart that's all. Well, don't let yourself get too smart. If you try to pull anything on me -- now wait a minute. It's a good idea for one of us to be here. Yeah. But remember, if he goes through those old records and accounts too carefully, we'll both have some explaining to do, and it won't be easy. Safest thing is to find a way to get him outta here. Yeah, that's right. See what you can do. Okay. And keep in touch with me. I'll work something out. You got it all right there on that list -- New beds, new uniforms, shop materials, paints, and so forth. The board's gonna have a fit when it sees this list. They better get used to it, - I'm gonna ask for a lot more later. Just remember that the lieason this fellow had his job so long was because he never asked for more than given. If I do the job I do it right. I need that to work. This will cost a lot of money. I'm not the only member of the board. Don't forget that. Look,~if those kids are better when they get out than they were when they went treat like human beings. Don't convince me. How about taking down those bars and the barbed-wire fences? What if those kids walk out? I hope not. If they do, it's my reputation. That fellow, Morgan, has got a lot of political friends. You make one slip, and he'll get you. Yeah, I know that. But I mustn't slip. I recommended you for the job. I'm going to see you through. Well, thanks, Bob. Make a copy of this. There's a miss Warren to see you, judge. I don't know any miss Warren. I don't know any miss Warren. Wait a minute.It's Frankie Warren's sister, the kid you sent have her come in, officer. This way, please. How do you do, miss Warren? Will you sit down? Now, what can I do for you, miss Warren? I was here few days ago with my Brother, Frankie Warren. You sent him up to the reform school for two years. And they haven't wasted any time starting their reform. Here's a letter I got from him. He sneaked it out of the Place. The first night he was there, they beat him. And when he tried to escape, he got caught in a barbed-wire fence. They threw him in a hospital with a drunken doctor in charge. You got to help me get him out of there. Help me. Excuse me, miss Warren, but here's the gentleman you have to talk to the new deputy commissioner. Well, hello, miss Warren. Mr. Braden I thought you were -- well, I tried to tell you the other day. I am in charge there now, and all those things did happen, and I'm sorry. But I had nothing to do with them. The man who beat your brother's been fired and so is the doctor. And I'm doing the best I can to change those conditions. I think I've made a pretty good start. Miss Warren, Mr. Braden knows more about this than I do. Why don't you go along with him, and he can explain it to you? Well, sure. I'd be glad to. I'll drive you home. I'll call you later, Bob. All right. Come in. -- Now, wait outside, guard. Yes sir. Come here. Sit down. No go ahead. Sit down. I want to have a talk with you. Yeah. How do you feel? I'm all right. Any idea about what kind of work you'd like to do while you're here? Yeah nothin'. Well, I think you're gonna find that pretty tiresome. Supposing I make you the head of a company of boys? I ain't playing fink for you, I don't fall for that soldier stuff! Wait a minute, Frankie. You got the wrong idea. I don't like stool pigeons any better than you do . Frankie, I was born about three blocks from where you live. And I was a pretty tough guy, too. But one day, I got to thinking, and I figured that tough guys were fall guys. They seemed to be getting all the bad breaks. is that what you want? It's okay. It's okay. I don't care. I can take anything you got! You can, but you're gonna be here for two years. I'll give you a chance to make a man out of yourself. Meet me halfway, I'll give you a break. I'll make my own! Now look here kid. you're still sore about that beating, I don't blame you -- I'd be sore, too. But things are gonna be different from now on. Now, you forget about that and string along with me. Listen, Braden, I ain't forgetting nothing, See? You're just another copper to me, I wouldn't trust one of you. The first chance I get, I'm gonna blow this joint! You and your friends ain't gonna stop me! All right. That's the way you feel about it-- There's nothing more I can say. That's all. But, Frankie... You better think over what I told you about tough guys. He's a pretty bad kid, mr. Braden. I'm afraid you're gonna have trouble with him and his whole gang,. Yeah I know. The only thing is to put them - to work, keep them occupied. What about kitchen duty? No no punishment. Hey I've got an idea. Have them clean and paint their own dormitory. They'll take an interest in that, and, it gives them a sense of responsibility. - Maybe they'll make good painters. I don't know. Yes sir. Thank you sorry. It's all right. Thanks. Hey, spike, make me a marble statue. Okay take off the clothes. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present my latest and greatest inspiration, a work of art -- the ''discus thrower." no, take it easy. Oh that's it. All right, boys, you can take a rest now. Well ... I didn't know we had so many fine artists in this dormitory. Hey wasn't that a blue suit? Yes, sir, but it had too many spots. Uh, I thought it'd look better all white. It does. You keep those for your pajamas. Oh what's this? Oh I see. And what are you supposed to be? A -- A marble statue. that's very good from the neck up. I think I'll put you out in the yard as a decoration, right in front of the gate, where everybody can see you on visitors' day. If I had to live here, I don't think I'd have so many pictures on the walls. This is your room, you have to sleep in it, if you like it this way, it's all right. I don't think those new beds are gonna fit very well in here. You struggle along with the old ones. I'll tell Mr. Cooper you're through and put your stuff back in the paint shop. Uh-huh. That's very nice -- very nice, indeed. Yes, I think you'll be very happy here. So long boys. Hey, I don't think I'm gonna like this room permanently. Maybe we'd better quit horsing around, huh? You know, Braden's Okay. I think he's trying to help us. Anytime a copper helps you, he's gonna get something out of you. Listen, you guys, we got to do this job right, see? Just for one reason -- 'cause we got to live here. Now, pep it up, because Cooper will be here in a minute. W-What happened to you, Coop? What'd you do -- fall in a bucket of paint? There isn't anything very funny about it, Mr. Braden. I went down to the dormitory, as you instructed me, and young Frankie Warren deliberately shoved a paintbrush in my face. One of the other boys tripped me, I fell on the floor. You can't let them get away with that. Ah you're right Cooper. Take away their privileges for a couple of weeks. See what effect that has on them. If you want real results, put them in the boiler room for a while -- that'll take the starch out of them. All right. Try that. Beginning tom01~row, they start shoveling coal. Yes sir. Does that guy got a crust putting us down in this hole or is he gunning for us? Boy, this is hard work here, if we was working. Yeah. There ought to be a law against this. Yeah. Ah, it was that guy Cooper's fault. It was Braden's, too. We're here, ain't we? Maybe this is his idea of getting tough with us. Yeah, I can get just as tough as he can. My old lady was gonna visit me today. She's out of jail now. Boy, is she gonna be disappointed. Yeah, my sister was gonna be here, too. In here Ms. Warren. Mr. Braden, the guard outside says I can't see my brother. Is that true? Yeah I'm sorry. It is. Those are my orders. Your orders? But why? What's he done? I had trou)Ble with him, I had to punish him. If my brother's done anything wrong, he had a reason. He hasn't. He got a w deal his first night here, he's been sore about it ever since. I tried to make it up to him every way, but he simply won't come around. He's got some kind of a crazy idea that I'm his enemy. He doesn't trust me any more than he did Morgan. We're all the same to him -- just coppers. You're the one that was gonna help him. It's bad enough to shut him ,up to keep him from seeing me, one personj that cares anything at all about him -- you call that helping him? Just a minute, I like Frankie, too, but he's always done exactly as he pleased, whether it affected anyone else or not, and he's got to learn obedience. If he doesn't, it just makes it tough for everybody. He's not the only kid in this school. I've got to think of the others, too. I don't care about the others. Frankie's my brother. Please, can't I see him? I'm sorry. You can't. I told you kids to keep that pressure up to 75, didn't I? Yeah. Well, why ain't you working? Say, what do you kids think you're doing? Sitting down. So I noticed. What's the idea? We're on a sit-down strike -- that's the idea. And we ain't shoveling no more coal, see? Oh that so? My orders are that if you don't work, you don't eat. Do you want me to report this to Mr. Braden? Stop it. You're scaring me, mister. Hey, Frankie, what are we gonna do? I wouldn't like to stop eating. Me neither. Let's go back to work. What do you say, f nk? So, what about it, Frankie? No work, no eat. Okay, but you can tell Braden from me he ain't gonna get away with this, see? Sure sure. Now, get busy and build that pressure up to 75. Okay, we'll give him 75. We'll give him more than 75. We'll give him 80! Make it 85. How about 90? Do I hear any more? 95. Make it 100. 110. Sold to goofy for 110. We'll give them so much, it'll throw these boilers out of commission. We won't have to work anymore. All right, let's go! Hey, squirt, how's number one? It's up to 85. It says ''danger'' at 90. So what? Come on, boys. Come on. All right. Go. Come on, get that coal in there! All right, fine. Hey, Frankie, It's over 90! Go. Don't give it any more coal! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, Frankie! Frankie, stop it, will you? Get out of here! Come on! Let's all get out of here! That boiler's liable to blow any minute! Let's go! Hey, what's that? I don't know. Hey, something's wrong. Come on. Let's go. Go! Hey, wait a minute -- squirt's missing. Yeah, he must be down there. Hey, squirt! Hey, squirt! Line up, boys. Hold 'em back! Keep 'em back! Mr. Braden! Mr. Braden! Yeah, what happened? One of the boilers blew up. Everybody out? I think so, Mr. Braden. All right clear that alley! Mr. Braden, Squirt's missing. Sure? He must have got caught down there. You can't go down there! The other one will blow any minute! Squirt! Braden's got nerve to go down there. Yeah, he's just making agrandstand play. All right, get back, will you? Get back! You wouldn't have the nerve to do it. Neither would I. Get back! Get back! You sure there are no fractures of any kind, doc? No, no, just some bad bruises and a few minor burns, that's all. He'll be uncomfortable for a few days, but it's nothing serious. You're a lucky kid squirt. Yeah, but if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be. I want to thank you, Mr. Braden. Forget it kid. All right, doc, you take good care of him. You bet. How is he? Hurt bad? He's gonna be all right. That's swell! You hear that? He's gonna be okay. Can we see him? Not now -- later fellas. Thanks. Come on, let's go, fellas. Wait till we tell him. Mr. Braden. Yeah? Well I ... Well, What is it, Frankie? I just want to thank you for saving squirt's life, that's all. You don't have to thank me. It's my job. But I'm to blame for all this trouble, didn't know what I was doing. Must've been crazy, and -- I deserve anything that's coming to me. There's nothing coming to you. You mean I - I don't get punished or nothing? No. I just want you to realize That your friend squirt in there might have been killed, and if he had been, you'd have been directly responsible. Yes sir. Now, you think that over. I guess I was wrong about you, Br. Braden. I've been a heel and I'll work with you from now on, if it's okay. Frankie, I've been waiting to hear you say that ever since you came in here. There's work, I need all the help I can get. We'll do it -- all of us. All right, thank you. That's a deal. Okay. ♪ put on your old, grey bonnet ♪ ♪ with the blue ribbon on it ♪ ♪ and we'll hitch old dobbin to the shay ♫ to the shay ♪ ♪ through the fields of clover, we will ride to dover ♪ ♪ on our golden wedding day ♪ hey get up. I got some more bulldogs for you. That'll keep us busy. I'm sick of fixing those old doghouses, see? What are you kicking about now, spike? What have we got to be cooped up in this hole for all day? Why can't we get on a gang that works out in the garden? Listen, first, ? We make good here, and maybe next month, we'll get that outside job. Gee, it'll be swell working out in the open. Sure, if we was out there, we could do anything. We could just make believe we was working. We're not laying down on the job, see? Cause Braden's a right guy. He's doing his best to help, we're working with him. Ain't that right fellas? That's right! Sure! All right, all right, all right. I just said I wanted to get on the outside, that's all. Hey, Frankie, you're in pretty good with Braden. Why don't you ask him? I promised Braden we'd stick to this job, earn the right to work outside. Oh, you promised Mr. Braden. Hey, you're getting kind of soft on that guy, ain't you? Sure. Anything he says is okay with me. Yeah, it's okay with me. yeah, Braden. You guys turned out to be a fine bunch of chickens. What are you making noise for? If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here. If you hadn't hit the junkman, we'd be home now. Sure, we took the rap for you, wise guy. I like it here, see, wise guy? Shut up-- I'm gonna bust you over the head! Boys, cut it out, now. What's going on? Ah, this guy's always beefing. Now he wants to go on the outside. Outside huh? Why don't you kids get Frankie to speak to Mr. Braden about it? He stands in okay, don't you, Frankie? Sure, that's what I was saying. You know what Mr. Braden said? No, what? He said I'm gonna be a first-class mechanic when I get out of this place. Frankie, That's swell. I ought to thank him for everything he's done for you. Why don't you? I can fix that. Going to town, Mr. Braden? Yeah. Oh, Mr. Braden! Oh, hello. Hello, Mr. Braden. You have a nice visit? We did. I want to thank you for everything you've done for Frankie. I didn't understand.

There's plenty. Get me judge Clinton's office in the city. Yeah, Morgan had quite a nice little graft system worked out for himself. I've checked with some of the business houses that supply the school, And they have no record of half the purchases listed here. How come you didn't know anything about it? Well, uh, Mr. Morgan took care of the finances here. I just attended to my duties as head guard. It was happening right under your nose. Well, I'm sorry Mr. Mraden. I don't know anything about it. Hello. Oh, hello, sue. Yeah, this is Mark. Hey, is the judge there? No, he's out now, he'll be back in half hour. Oh fine. Sue, tell him I'd like to see him tomorrow morning, will you?

Yeah. and get me an outside line. Here's the Hawkins boy, Mr. Cooper. Come in. That's all, guard. Hawkins, Mr. Braden fears that you're a bad influence in this school. He's been thinking of transferring you to the house of correction up the river. What for? I ain't done nothing. We've got lot of complaints about you from the other boys. So what? Sit down. I just thought I'd warn you, that's all. If he finds out. It was you who slugged junkman in the city -- what are you talking about? Who told you that? Never mind. It's true. I'm telling you that if Braden finds out about it, you'll go up the rI'ver for fI've years. That's the toughest zoo in the state. Look, you don't have to tell him, do you? What'll it get you? Well it depends. Cigarette? If you're wise, I might not have to. I don't get it. You play ball with me, and I might forget it. I don't mind playing ball. Long as I ain't catching. What's the gag?

Come on, let's make a break for it. Where you going? Hey, Frankie. What? I want to tell you something. What about? Well, I didn't want the other guys to hear it. Has Braden ever taken sue out? What do you mean? Nothing, except that I was in the front office, and I heard the guy what handles the telephone tell one of the guards, Braden made a date with sue tonight. Well what about it? Oh, nothing. According to what they said, Braden must have been passing some cracks about him and sue. They was laughing about it. What are you saying? You want me to keep my trap shut every time I hear something against you? Against me? Against your sister. Same thing. One of them made a crack about sue paying off for you. Take it back. Say you didn't mean it, or I'll wipe the floor with you! Take it back! I'll take it back. You don't want me to tell you anything I hear, that's okay. I know how you feel. I wouldn't lie to you. What would it get me? Yeah. I'm sorry I hit you, spike. Come on, let's eat. Here we are. You had three empty plates in front of you. Well, everything all right, boys?

That's nice for you, huh, Frankie? Yeah yeah sure it is. Braden's been putting on a big-brother act with Frankie, and meanwhile, he's been pushing his sister around. What? Who told you that? Yeah, where'd you hear that? Everybody in the joint knows it except you guys. I got hep to it in the front office today. That's a lot of malarkey. I don't believe it. Don't believe that stuff, Frankie. He's full of bunk. All right, wise guy, where's Braden tonight? Where is he? I'll tell you where. He's out with sue. Smart guys. Now listen, Frankie, I wouldn't steer you wrong. All you got to do is to go into town tonight and find out whether it's true or not. Eh, you're cl How's he gonna go to town? Cop a gander Joe. I found these keys in the ignition in Cooper's car. You know, there's a back door on that garage, it ain't got no lock on it, all we got to do is blow down there tonight, open the door, push the car out, and ... ... thieved. You mean for Frankie to make a break in Cooper's car? Yeah if he's got the nerve. And by the way, there's something else I found. Gad. Where'd you get that? Don't touch it, Frankie.

Oh that looks good. - and it tastes good. Well let's eat it. Get away from h-er, you. Frankir! What are you doing here, kid? Are you crazy? I'm wise to you for the first time.

Listen, you guys, I ain't getting mixed up in no murder, see? I'm gonna take a powder. Listen, Joe, you're staying with us, see? Crazy kid. If you hadn't made that break, I'd have you out in a month.

It's too late now. Get in there and keep quiet. Come on, open this door. I'm coming. I heard a shot as I was passing the house. These people say it came from this flat. That's right, officer. I'm Mark Braden, deputy commissioner of correction. I was just changing my gun from one pocket to the other and it accidentally went off. Okay, Mr. Braden. It pays to be careful of those things. You're right. Almost shot myself in the foot. Thanks very much for dropping in, officer. That's all right. Folks, come on, break it up. Nothing to see. Come on. All right, Frankie. Frankie? - You lied to me, - no. You and Cooper fixed it up so I'd make the break? No I swear we didn't. Braden was gonna get us paroled, see? We may get another year tacked on. But I'm gonna finish you before we do, see?! Frankie, no! You're choking me! Frankie! Frankie! Come on, Frankie! Ah, get out of here! Go on! I'll kill him! Haven't you done enough harm for one night? Yeah but spike lied to me. Why'd you do it? I didn't want to. Cooper made me steam Frankie up. What do you mean? He found out that I was the guy who hit junkie, he said he'd tell you, you'd send me up the rI'ver for fI've years. Where'd you get that gun? I gave it to him. Cooper's idea, too. He fixed it up for us to make this break. Well, how'd you get here? In a car. In Cooper's car. It's around the corner. Get in that car, meet me out front. Okay, Mr. Braden. come on! Come on, let's go! Where are the boys? They're waiting outside. Hello? Hello, hello, Bob? This is Mark. Six kids broke out, and I'm in a spot. I know about it, been trying to get you. You've any idea where they are? Yeah, they're right here with me. If you're going to do anything about it, you'd better hurry. Your old friend Morgan and the chief commissioner are on their way now. They left 10 minutes ago. Thanks Bob. All right, get in my car and don't ask any questions. Come on, clI'mb in there. Keep out of sight. now, you take these kids. Do exactly what I tell you. I told you this would happen someday, commissioner. You can't run a place the way Braden's trying to do And expect to get away with it. Look good sitting there, Mr. Cooper. Get it, Jack. Hold it, Mr. Cooper. Got it. Thank you. Here's the commissioner. How about a statement, commissioner? Do you know anything about this? How about it, Mr. commissioner? Give me a chance. I'm trying to find out myself. Commissioner, this is Mr. Cooper, head guard. I'm sure he can tell you everything. What happened? How did they get away? Stole the keys to my car, broke in to the ga ge, and got away without anyone seeing them. If I hadn't been going through the dormitories myself, we wouldn't have discovered their escape until this morning. What about Mr. Braden? Isn't he supposed -- I did hear from one of the boys. This young Frankie Warren, leader of the gang, has been making threats against Mr. Braden's life. There was a gun in my car, and I'm afraid, gentlemen, The next thing you'll hear is that a murder has been committed. Ah, good evening, gentlemen. Mr. Braden. What about the escape, mr. Braden? Those kids were after you? Wait a minute. I haven't time now. Any idea where they are? - Good evening commissioner. Oh, hello, Morgan. What is this, Cooper? A party for the press? Well, well, well, Mr. Braden, What do you know about this break? I just heard about it.? Stopped at a gas station and heard those two officers talking about it. That right gentlemen? Yes sir. That's right. So, I brought them along just in case of any trouble. Now, Cooper, exactly what happened? Young Warren and his gang broke out tonight and stole my car. Did you broadcast an alarm? I did. Got a crowd of men out Looking for them. Anybody with you when you discovered the break? No, nobody but me? Nobody but you. Nice work, Cooper. I never had any breaks when I was in charge. If you'd been here and on the job, Mr. Braden -- and, by the way, Morgan, what are you doing here? I'm trying to help the commissioner. Oh I see. I'm very glad you're here, because that makes it most convenient. Mr. Braden, this is a serious matter. If those boys should happen to kill somebody -- Oh, you're right, commissioner. I was horrified when I heard about it. Still can't believe it. You'll when I show how they got out. Come on men. There's the window they got out of. And now, gentlemen, you can see for yourself. Hey what is ... What's going on here? Well, well, well, fancy meeting you here. What's going on here? Can't a guy even get his beauty sleep around here? Can't a guy even get his beauty sleep around here? These the boys you were talking about? I ... I don't understand. There they are, all six of them. Count them. You mean they're here, mr. Braden? I don't know. Let's ask them. Here, boys? Sure we're here! Why don't you knock before you come busting in a guy's boudoir? What's wrong with you guys? Ain't you got no manners? Where's your etiquette? That's it! That's the word -- ''ediquit''! Boy that's good! There's been some dirty work going on here. An hour ago, they weren't in bed, don't know how they got back. Cooper, I'm worried about you. You feel all right? He don't look so good to me, Mr. Braden. He don't look so good to me, Mr. Braden. What about this? What's the matter, jojo?! What's the matter?! Leave go of the dogs! Leave go of the dogs! What are you doing in bed with your shoes on? Go on, screwball . I always sleep with my shoes on. Well, looks like the escape's a flop. Sorry, gentlemen. What a bust. This is a frost in mI'dsummlir. Wait a minute, boys. I got a good story for you. What's it? Let's have it. Mr. Commissioner, I've been checking over the records, and I charge Mr. Morgan With misappropriating the funds of this institution for the past 12 years. That's a lie! Prove it first. I can and will. Take him away. You can't arrest me without a war nt. I don't need a war nt. I'm a special officer. Mr. Commissioner, are you gonna let him do this to me? I don't care what he does to you! You dragged me out of bed at 1:00 in the morning for a wild goose chase! Take him away! Come on you. Yeah, right, Mr. Commish -- take him away! We never had no use for him. Good night, Mr. commissioner. So long commissioner! All right, boys, quiet down now. Go to sleep now. So long. Goodbye, Mr. Braden. And nice work. Adios, Mr. Braden. Hey, where's Cooper? Still attending to your duties as head guard, eh, Cooper? Wait outside officer. I want to go over the books with Mr. Cooper. And I don't want to be disturbed, understand? All right, sir. I understand. Where's Mr. Braden? In there, but he's busy right now, and he doesn't want to be disturbed. What's that?! I didn't hear anything. I did! What's that?! Oh, that's just Mr. Braden going over the books with Mr. Cooper. Have a piece of gum. Good heavens! What's happening?! Now, wait a minute. Control yourself. Let me in! Wait a minute! Don't get excited! Sorry! I can't! Wait a minute, will ya, please?! I can't! Will you control yourself? He's killed him. Mark! Are you all right? Yes, I'm all right. Officer, we've gone over the books. I don't need Mr. Cooper anymore. You can take him away. Yes sir. Take good care of him. I've realized that, essentially, you boys are all right and that you're going to make worthwhile citizens. Through the efforts and recommendations of Mr. Braden and through your own good behavior and cooperation, the board of correction has given me the privilege of informing you that, effective as of this day, you are paroled. And I'll be glad to see the time come when the last boy will walk out. and no longer will there be a necessity for any kind of reform schools. For those of you who are old enough, Mr. Braden has made arrangements to place you in various trades. The others will continue with their schooling, and wherever possible, We're going to try to help you get a part-time work. When I see the expressions on the faces of your parents, I feel g teful, and I know you do, too, for all Mr. Braden has done for you. Now, boys, you're free to go home. And now you come home and I'll show you your new brothers! Brothers? Three! Ha! Be with you in a minute, ma. What are you reading, Richard? See for yourself. Very interesting subject. May I borrow it next? Why, certainly, Timothy. Thank you. Who you looking for, Frankie? My sister. Oh, she just went out the door with Mr. Braden. She did? Yeah. Good! Let me be the first to congratulate you, Frankie. -Gee, thanks a lot. Can I be the best man? I'm gonna be the best man. You can be second-best.
