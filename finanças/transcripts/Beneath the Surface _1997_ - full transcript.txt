The piano lessons and stuff. Really good. I can play fourhanded now. I'll show you. It's great fun. Sure, you're so clever, Jannika. You'll turn out a fine girl, I'm sure. I've been taking driving lessons. And when I get my license - - we can go somewhere together. Maybe go to a nightclub. Maybe have a drink. What the hell do you know about drinks? - How is dad doing? - Good. Mum promised me that I could have my birthday party at her place. Isn't that great? Uncle and Anita are coming. - At mum's place? What the hell for? - Because I wanted to. You can come too, if you... Flowers for my flower girl. Bye. Eh? What do you say? Let's get the hell out, girl. This bloody madhouse... Dishevelled nuts and idiots all over the damned place. I need you. Understand? Good. Come here, Roffe. Come here. Jannika? Your dad called. He wanted you to call him. I'm 18 now. Look at that. Maybe you can play something for us. Sure. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to... you. Happy birthday, dear Jannika. Oh, right... God damn! - Hurray! - Thanks, Sandra. Four cheers for Jannika. Happy birthday! Hurray! - I'm so glad you came, Sandra. - Long time no see. - You're so big now, Sandra. - I'm Roffe. - Please, Sandra... - Have a seat. To my beloved sister on her... What? No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Listen to me now. Since... I was thinking... Since it's your birthday today, I thought I'd fix you... - Sandra. - I'm fine. Want to lie down? I thought I'd... I thought I'd fix you... fix... Fix... fix... Damn, maybe I'm not doing so good after all. - Hi there. - Roger. Sandra? Would you like to go and lie down on the bed? I don't want to rest. It's party time. It's your birthday! - Let's celebrate. - Have a seat. The whole family is here. Where's dad? Dad, he... He's always... He's always been welcome here. That's right. I forgot. He wasn't invited. Isn't that so? I've got something to tell you. I'm moving in with mum. Mum promised me I could stay here. We can get together when we like. Are you crazy? You want to live with this bitch? This is no place to live. - Jannika is moving in with me. - Is she? How bloody nice. You're going to live with this bitch? Have you lost it completely? We thought that you'd be happy that Jannika was moving in with me. You... Fuck you! Fuck you! Don't you fuck with me! You got it? Got that, you damn cunt? - Easy... - She's not moving in here! Fuck! Are you going to destroy her life too? - I'm calling the police. - She's calling the police! Call them! She's going to call the police. She usually does that, but that's okay. - Congratulations. - Call them, then, you fake cunt. Jannika, I love you. Love you. - Love you. Cunt. - Hi there. Ouch, God damn it! My foot! No thanks. - Go on in. I'll wait here. - No. What do you mean no? Why are we sitting here, then? Go on. I'm worried about Jannika. Get it? I think I saw that guy in the window. Go on in and talk to him. - Eh? What do you mean no? - I need that fix now, Roffe. I need it now. Just get us out of here. Get us the hell out of here. You damned rat, get the goods out! - Come on, Lasse. - Then give me the three grand. - Don't fuck with me! - What do you mean? Three grand. - Come on, let's go. - Let me see the money. - Show me the goods! - Three grand. Don't forget. Hi there. There's a slut in here. Shut up, Roffe. I need that fix. - A real damn slut. - Shut up! I need that shot now. A little blabbermouth, a bastard with a tail - - who'll wish he was never born. Roffe, damn it! You just left. - Where's the goods? - I sold them. We've got unfinished business. I told you to sell them? Where's the money, then? Those pricks took the money. - They took it. - You don't just quit on a deal. Would Gyllenhammar do that to Asea? Those little cunts fucked it all up! I'm telling you. - What the hell are you saying? - Calm the fuck down! - What are you talking about? - Calm the fuck down. Now what? Now what do you say? - Don't you hustle me. - Shoot, then. Just shoot. So you don't think I dare shoot her? I will shoot her. - Pull, God damn it. - Just shoot. I'll pull it. Just shoot me. You God damned loser. You want me to help you? Okay, I'll help you. Pull it, God damn it! Pull it, damn you. Pull it! Need a hand? Sandra. Roffe, it's not bloody working! What a piece of crap! It's the police! Open up! Sorry, Roffe! Johansson! Spit out that capsule. Spit it out! That's it. Take it easy. Lie still! Get the cuffs out. Carrying any sharp objects? Knives or needles? - She's getting away! - We'll pick her up later. Easy now. Shit! You know, I'm so bloody tired of you just leaving me all the time. You listen to me now. Listen up! If you leave me alone once more... - You can just go to hell. - Shut up. You just shut up. I really love you. I love you so much. Come on. You and I, Flower, we'll bring home so much cash we can swim in it. How? We just have to pick up the stuff. You'll have to find some other broad who won't mind doing 100 years. What do you mean? You'll get to see Thailand. What's more, you'll get to swim. Eh? - Granny is cooking now. - Granny? Hi, Sandra. There you are. - What the hell are you doing here? - Just taking a walk. - Thought I might find you. - Jannika, I'm busy right now. I've got loads of stuff to do. - Like what? - Busy. Important stuff. I'm doing something important, okay? - You need any help? - Come on. Leave me alone. Go on. Run on home to mum, okay? Okay? Roffe, are you listening? Roffe? I told Jannika to just do like this. - Roffe? - Yeah, sure. Hi there, granny. Hi. Little Louise, little Louise on her way to Paris she's not really used to travelling 'cause little Louise is only 17 and soon the train will reach Gare du Nord yes, little Louise, her heart's pounding away an entire week in paradise and little Louise, but of course, "Mademoiselle"... "Carry your bags to the taxi, n'est ce pas" here comes the man from the south who's so kind and says that he'll show her Paris every night and every time they go out, he kisses her... ... and makes time stop love comes and love goes only the lucky one gets love for keeps. What's your name? What's a cute little girl like you called? - Lena. - Lena... What a pretty name. Lena. You want my social security number as well? Are you a little whore? Is that what you are? Are you a little whore? A little whore... Sure, whatever you say. You know what I want you to do? - Cash first. - Yes, of course. God damn it! What the... What the hell? Hi there, want to fuck? You want to fuck? This is the best fuck you ever had, you bastard. You'd better fucking appreciate it! Roffe, wait up! Don't leave, you bloody coward! Roffe! - Let me in! - No, Sandra. Let me in, you bitch, or I'll kick the door in! Not while you're doing drugs. Can I have a chat with Jannika? I said, can I have a bit of a chat with Jannika? - Jannika isn't in. - This late? It's not that late, Sandra. Jannika went to the cinema. To the cinema? While you sat at home drinking. But... Hi there. Who's that? Come here, let me have a look. Come on, come on... - Sandra, let me wipe it off. - Stop it! - Who's he? - Nobody. - What happened? - Nothing. Have you gone mad? Are you trying to look like a whore? What's this? What is this? I was just going out to see if I could find you anywhere. If we could do something fun. God damn it. I knew that it would end like this. I just knew it. And you just stop imitating me this instant! I don't want anything to do with you anymore! Open it. See who it is. Police. Ms Lundgren, we're looking for Sandra. - Yes? - We need to talk to her. Do you know where she is? We're so worried. If you find her, could you please ask her to come home? - May we come in? - Do you have a warrant? No, but it would be wise of you to let us in. Bye, then. If you see Sandra, please ask her to call me. Let's go. - Talk to us. Talk to us! - You heard what Johansson said. Where were you on the night of October 16, 1996? We've got photos. At home. Can I go to the loo now? Let's go over this once more. Did Roffe sell the heroine? - In October 1996. - Come on! I need to take a piss. I haven't been to the loo all night! - We've got photos of it! - Did Roffe sell the heroine? - I haven't even seen that smack. - You're going to do time for it. - Don't you get that, Sandra? - I haven't got a clue. Did you do the trafficking? We're getting tired of this, so we want to hear the truth now. - Don't be so bloody loyal. - Okay... If I admit that I did it, - - can you get me into rehab? Could you fix that for me? Hi, Roffe. Thanks for calling. They didn't even tell me when it was. They didn't even tell me when my granny's funeral was. This is just too much. There wasn't a soul here. You didn't blab, did you? - No, of course I didn't. - Good. They didn't have shit on me. Amateur pigs. Here. It's my last one. - I have new plans. - I'm going to a clinic. You know, my plan in Thailand. Swimming. I won't be out for another two years. It takes two years. What are you saying? What the hell are you saying? How do we get the stuff? - Eh? - What do you mean "get the stuff"? Is it me or the stuff that you want? You. Of course I miss you. Don't you get that? Flower... See you, Roffe. Take care. We can go. Hi. Welcome to The Cottage. Welcome. - Settle down now! - Let go of him, pig bastard! Easy. Take it easy! You damn whore! Easy, easy! I don't want him inside. Put him in number 11! Jannika! It's Roffe, Sandra's best mate. - I didn't recognize you. - Where are you going? - Excuse me? - Where is my cute girl going? - I'm going to school. - I'll give you a ride. I'll let you off right by the school. Thanks, but I'll walk. Hey, Sandra called. She wanted me to tell you something. Damn junkies! What are you doing here? Go back to Stockholm! Beat it! There's a Rolf on the phone for you. Why would he be calling you? It's probably about Sandra. Yes, he's my dad. Could you tell him from me that... We've got visitors' days this weekend. Yes, this weekend. And he is... Hello? That's right. He would be very welcome. Tell him that Sandra is waiting. Would you do that for me? That's so cool. I mean, thanks very much. Thanks. Bye. Dad. Welcome. A little coffee will fit nicely now. Welcome to The Cottage. Why don't you move in with me? - You can take over the large room. - Sure. - I can put up new wallpaper. - Dad, I've finished my lemonade. You did? Go and fetch some more over there, will you? And bring some for me as well. Dad... Dad. - Excuse me? - I knew you'd come. Pardon me. What are you doing? - I've missed you. - No! I've missed you so, dad. Daddy... Well... What did you and Sandra use to do, then? - We did everything. - What do you mean? You know what I mean. When does Sandra... When Sandra comes back... Maybe we can go somewhere. All three of us. Maybe we can go to ?re. Do you ski? I'm pretty good at it. We... I'm about to get my license. I can drive you. - ?re? - Sure. - Cheers. - No, I'm... Tummy ache. I'm not thirsty. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Are you upset? Granny... She died a while ago. Poor you. Are you sure you don't want wine? Have some, why don't you? - Just a little, then. - A little. Okay. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Sorry. - That's okay. In Japan a burp earns you a kiss. - No... - Sure. Come on, it's true. - What is it? - I just feel a little flushed. - Are you and Sandra in love? - We're just friends. No no, I can't. You're Sandra's boyfriend. We're mates. We just do business together. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. You are pretty. Smell good. - Where are you going? - I've got to go. This is so wrong. Hello, Sandra. Here. I bought you some candy. The staff told me you weren't doing so well. Well, it isn't very good... ... if you're not... feeling well. Is that so? How is Jannika doing? - Rolf speaking. - What the hell are you up to? And who the hell gave you the right to touch my sister? - What are you talking about? - You fucking rat. You just leave my sister alone, or I'll cut off your cock. Maybe I should just blow your head off. You little twat! You damn snitch! You betrayed me, you... You drive, God damn it. Go on, drive. Okay. Caf? Claudia at five, then. Fine. Bye. - Who was it? - Just a wrong number. I see... You know how much I love you, Flower. You know that I just want you to... To feel good. You know that, don't you? That I like you. Good. You know, Sandra envies you. What do you mean? Because you don't sit at home and play with LEGO. You know, she told me that you... You used to live with your dad. Isn't that so? You know how cross she got when you moved in with your mum. She wants you to move back to daddy. You want to do that? - No, never! - Well, there you have it. Eat. - Besides, she's jealous. - Why is that? Because you're with me now. You're with me now. Aren't you? Sure, you're with me now? Isn't that so? I just wanted you to know. You see, I care about you. It's sort of important to me that you feel... ... good. Get it? Do you? Close your eyes. You sure? Are they closed? I already ordered the tickets! Hell, are we going to bathe or what? - Roffe, you're the best. - You don't say? I have a plan. When we get back, we are going to be so rich. And we'll feel great and wear Style E-clothes. No fucker is going to say anything about us being... We're good. We'll show them. No fucker... And one more thing. No fucker is going to tell you that you're just a kid. - Exactly. I'm no kid. - And one more thing. - You're no kid. - No, I'm no kid. We'll just have to find a little cash. I've found you the coolest job. You have? Eh? Did you lose you glasses or what? I don't need them anymore. Nice seeing you again. Sis... Can't we just go somewhere? Leave this place. You and I. - We can go to Barbados. - Barbados? You and I? Girls like us will probably end up in ?land or something like that. - What are we going to do, then? - You have to go home. What do you mean? Hell... You can't keep doing what you do. It's not working, it won't do. - You have to go home now. - You know nothing. I'm an adult now. I'm doing just fine on my own. And you want to end up like me, or what? Bloody rookie. I don't think you really care about me. You want me out of your mind. Get rid of a little problem. - You know that's not true. - What do you want me to do, then? - Answer me! - Well... I think you should move back to dad. That's what I want you to do. Just as I thought. But you know... Roffe and I, we have a plan. And he's got me a job. You just wait and see. Then you can choke on your envy, because we didn't let you in on it. You fucking... ... cunt! I'm sorry. Jannika, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, damn it. Calm down. Easy, damn it! You want some? Easy... Easy. Sandra! Come back. Sandra! Come back. San... Hi there. Long time no see. How are you? Whoa, where do you think you're going? What the hell are you doing? Can I talk to her? - Leave my sister the fuck alone. - Are you jealous? Stop it. Don't fuck with me. I'm here to get Jannika. Jannika, come here! - Come on. - Do you crave it? Do you? Don't you crave it? You bloody well seem to, if you ask me. Eh? Come and get it. You look like you need it. - Come on. - Tell me you're a needle whore. Come and get it. Roffe, please. I'll do anything. Pardon? Just tell me you're a little needle whore. Roffe, Roffe... Roffe... What the hell were you thinking, going away to the woods, you cunt? Take a bath. Looking good, honey pie! - Is this your new job or what? - What are you doing here? Are you stupid or what? - Eh? - Let go! Let go. Let go, damn it! - Hey, there! On the ground. - Stay calm. - Stay still! Get the other girl. - I'll be right there. Stay still! Jannika, do something! Get out of here! Have you got anything on you? Stay still! Jannika! Get the girls! After them! - Stop! - Jannika! Move! Move, damn it! Move, you idiot! Stop! Stay there! Shit, hurry up. Jannika! - Move! - Stop, damn it! Damn it! I love you, Jannika. We should do everything together. - Do you think she'll die, Sandra? - No, she'll be fine. Jannika, you have to go home. Roffe will be furious. There's a fire in the stairwell! Open the door! There's one hell of a fire! Open the door! - Coming. - There's a fire! Open up! - Who is it? - There's a fire! Open! - What are you doing here? - Jannika! - Jannika! - I don't want you here. Shut up! Jannika! - Jannika. - I didn't mean to. - It'll be alright. - Leave. Shut up! We're in one hell of a hurry. Come on. - It'll be alright. - Get out. Jannika! - How could you lose a whole bag? - I'm sorry. That's just too much. Eh? You're fucking with our future. Don't you get that? Don't you get that? I'm trying to build something for us. Don't you get that? Don't you? To make it good for us. You couldn't even manage to keep her at home for a day. Roffe could just walk right in and take her. Did you even fight back? Maybe you even helped him. You did, didn't you? You've never gone hungry, even at the worst of times. - Never gone hungry. - You're fucking unbelievable. How the hell can you think of food? Where the fuck did that come from? I'm saying that you are an alcoholic. That you can't take care of your children. It would have been a thousand times better if we'd both lived with dad. Damn, it would have been fine not having to grow up at your place. To be rid of your fish fingers and your bloody vodka bottles - - and your disgusting, hairy men who ogled us as soon as we moved! Now the exact same thing has happened to Jannika. Because you're a fucking loser. Hi... Sandra? Dad, I wanted to... I was thinking, you know... Dad... Dad... Where is Jannika? Where is Jannika? Jannika needs your help, okay? - What the hell? Come on. - I've got to... - Shut up! - Please, please... Please, I need to go home. - I want to go home. - Shut up. What the hell are you doing? God damn it. You can't even fuck. Get out, then! Get lost! Damn. Get out! - 500. - What? What the fuck? I told you to charge more! What the hell did I tell you? Hell, everything's gone to shit. What can I do? I told you, I can't do everything by myself. I can't. We've talked about this. How the hell am I supposed to... Forget it. Let's go home and grab a bite, - - and I'll tell you about Thailand instead. - How much is it? - 1,500. - That's expensive. - But it's worth it. 1,500. Take it or fucking leave it. Okay. Hop on in, then, girl. Hop on in. Get in! Are you a little whore? Is that what you are? Are you a little whore? Eh? Hello? Hello there? You know what I want you to do, don't you? Eh? Hell... Yes... Shit! Jannika? Jannika? It's me. Sandra. Your sister. Hello? Hello? Darling? Beat it! Get lost! - What? - Don't you touch her again. What are you on about? I need my 170 grand, before she... Will you listen to me? You won't touch my sister again. You got that? This is what we'll do now. Hush, she's asleep. Call me sometime. - Close the door. - Sure. - Johansson. - I know about a heroine deal. But I want something out of it. - Do you have anything to declare? - No. We were made for this, Flower. I love you. You and I back together again. - Aren't we? - Yeah. Here. Where are you going? Eh? - Police! Stay still! - Let go of that bag in your hand! Put your hands on the car! This is the four o'clock news. The man who injured - - two policemen at Arlanda airport yesterday - - is still on the run. When the policemen tried to arrest - - a suspected drug smuggler, he opened fire... - Sandra? Sandra, let me in. - ... is considered dangerous. Sandra, let me in. Jannika is in the hospital. - Where is she? - Ward 2, but she's in a coma. - Hey, get back here! - Let go! Have you talked to the doctor? Otherwise you'll have to leave. - No. - Yes, you get out of here. You have to leave. Take it easy. Listen to me now. I am her mother. I must see my daughter. I know it feels terrible... - Sandra! - You have got to leave now. Don't make things worse for Jannika. - Calm down. - Listen to me now. Flower... How the hell could you? Just shove that Flower shit. - What did you do to Jannika? - Excuse me? - Do you know how she looks? - What are you talking about? Have you lost it completely? You must know what you've done! The pigs found Jannika in the subway last night, beaten to a pulp. Hey! It's a few hours since you ratted on me. I'm wanted for shooting a pig. Do you really think I've got time to deal with your sister? Well, who the hell was it? Piss off. Piss off, I said. Roffe! Roffe, lift your hands nice and easy. That's it. I need to talk to them. You just go ahead. Move towards us. Nice and easy. Hell no! Jannika... God damn it. You're alive. I'm going to get the one who did this so bad. I'll kill him. I finally got hold of Roffe, but he didn't do it. - Do you remember anything? - I can't believe how stupid you are. You don't understand anything. - It's always been dad. - What has? Mum, I don't think Jannika is feeling that well. I think she needs to rest. I'm going to fix this. - Dad has beaten me all my life. - Say what? You're through fixing things. You don't even understand that he isn't your dad. Is this something you told her, or is she nauseous or...? Does she have a fever or what? Say something, will you? Why don't you give her a scolding? Dad got it into his head that I had been unfaithful to him. So when you were born, he refused to hold you. He didn't even want to see you. I thought it would be good for Jannika to live with dad. He had... ... money and the house and... - Leave me alone, damn it! - Sandra, the house... - Sandra? - Shut up. - I can explain. - I don't want to hear it. I think you should just shut up. You damned child molester. What are you talking about? - What are you imagining? - Imagining? lmagining? You know, Jannika might as well have been dead now. I've always thought so highly of you. Dad... Don't touch me! Dear God... You called me... You called me a bastard. Bastard. It's your mother's fault. She had sex with my best friend. It's not my fault that you became an illegitimate child. I didn't know. You're not even my child, Sandra. You're lying to me now, and I don't want to hear any more lies. No one in this world is going to lie to me anymore. Got it? Jannika! Jannika, come here! I just wanted you to care a little about me. I just wanted you to think of me once in a while. Sandra! Come back. Come back. But you just wanted me to die! Yes! You wanted me to die. Now, then... Do you care about me now? Do you care about me now? No? Sandra. Mummy... Sandra. Mummy, mummy...
