Harry calls his island Noman so that if anyone ever asks him, "Noman, what's that?", he can simply answer, "Noman is an island." To date, [chuckles] no one has asked. Perched on the opposite shore is the 36,000 square foot castle belonging to the heard of but rarely seen, Mr. and Mrs. Lapham. And today, while the Laphams plan their housewarming party and big reveal of the prodigious facelift made to their castle, Harry March has plans of his own. Devious plans.

And what does Mr. Lapham require today? The usual Harry, everything. You know, ten months is no time for a job this big and to top it all off, he's having a party now. [Harry] Ten months? Has it only been ten months? Morning, Hector. Your master's in a pissy mood this morning. [Hector] The Lord God is my master. [grunts] How goes the erection? He wants another floor. Four floors. Yeah, well that's because no one else has more than three. So what do we have so far? A state of the art kitchen, a state of the art movie theater, a state of the art toilet? Twenty-six toilets, Harry. - [Harry] Are they all in bathrooms? - [chuckles] A sun deck, a moon deck, a hot tub, a cold tub, a pool to die for. You'll write a novel about it one day, Harry. [Hector] There's an idea. Do some writing for a change. Be quiet. [Hector] I am quiet. [radio scratching] [singing in foreign language] Hombres, good news.

Mr. March, how did Mr. Lapham make his money anyways? Jack. Asparagus tongs. His great grandfather invented the asparagus tongs. Then, he branched out. He made nutcrackers, he made lobster crackers, grape scissors, little spoons for escargot. His family makes a fortune from grasping. Does he work? He blogs. He writes aphorism. Lapham's aphoms, drops one off every day for my crew. Listen to this one. "He does not promote himself will not be promoted." No shit. I like yesterday's better. "More is more."

I'm giving a lecture. I don't want to, but I already took their money. [Hector] Yippy, upstate New York. Why do people give lectures anyway? To hear themselves talk. [Hector] I forgot, what is this lecture about? It's on the meaning of the 20th century. I'm glad I didn't wait till the last minute. - [Hector] Can I hear it? - Sure. The 20th century, 100 years of progress. In early America, money alone couldn't buy a social position. Today, nobody cares. That's my lecture. You've been a wonderful audience. I'm here till doomsday. Hey, isn't it about time for one of your daily naps? [Hector] Ah, you're such a cliché. I'm a cliché? What do you call a talking dog? [Hector, sighing] Bite me.

[Hector] And West Hampton? [Harry] Noise and gossip and dentists. [Hector] So what about East Hampton? - Noise and gossip. - [Hector] That's it? Mr. March! Mr. March! Skippy Brewster from the club.

Asshole. [Hector] What do Hamptonites do in the daytime? They speak of their careers. [Hector] Why do they do that? Makes them happy. Sometimes they even advance their careers by speaking to other Hamptonites. That's why they live here. [Hector] Oh, that's nice. It's not nice. None of this is nice. [Hector] But isn't a career important? Not when it interferes with a life. [Hector] What else do Hamptonites do in the daytime? - They make themselves beautiful. - [Hector] And what else? They prepare to attend parties or throw parties. [Hector] And what else? They dream up great works. [Hector] What becomes of them? Nothing. [Hector] And what else? They hope other Hamptonites are thinking of them. They hope everyone is thinking well of them. [Hector] And are they? No and no. [Hector] Are there any poor people in the Hamptons? Yes, but they're not allowed out. [Hector] What about Kevin? Is he rich, too? Kevin? No Kevin works for a living. [Hector] Like you? [chuckles] Tell me. [sighs] So? Don't worry about the Hamptons.

You brought up the subject so you get the subject. [Hector] I was only trying to pass the time pleasantly on a summer's day. The Hamptons are all the same and all the world wants what the Hamptons have so that it too can have everything and be empty at the core. And you know who embodies and symbolizes, generates and perpetuates this universal vacuity? [Hector] I do, but you're going to tell me anyway, aren't you? Correct, Lapham.

[Kathy mimicking cat growling] [chuckles] And for all that, I shall gladly cut off my luxurious braid of hair and I'll hand it over to you myself. - Never. - Harry March. [mock gasp] You're hurting me. Never say never. I must say, Harry, I get all hot just thinking what you're gonna be doing with my hair. What about $50,000? Uh, this conversation is concluded. You sell me your island and my hair is yours. Your island, your house. My life then. That's my price, sweet pea, take it or leave it. Learn to live in the real world, Harry. As Mr. Lapham says, "The sun also rises, but it also sets." ♪♪ I like that one. [narrator] Unwilling to sell his soul, Harry went on his cantankerous way. [Hector barking] - Why do you do that? - [Hector] Do what? Bark at the sight of another dog. - [Hector] Because other dogs bark at me. - [Harry] Yes, but why? [Hector] You know, I'm not really sure. [barking] You don't see me flying off the handle when I spot a another human being. [Hector] Actually, I do. [Hector barking] Hector! Hector! [groans] Get in the car. Don't worry, officer, I'm fine. You're lucky I'm taking you to the hospital and not the station house for being a creep at a toy store. That's me, all right, lucky. [mysterious music] [typewriter keys typing] [breathing heavy] [distant thunderclap] [Hector] Oh, it must be wonderful, the literary life, to be a literary lion as you are. I'm a literary dog, you know? I'm sure you are. [Hector] Is Mr. Lapham a literary lion? He has an awfully nice car. Hey, do you suppose he might give me a ride someday? He must miss his dear departed Westie? Will you ever shut up? [Hector] When the time comes. [thunderclap] [Harry] Hey, come here, come here. I don't think you should see this. Go in there. ♪♪ Do you even think about how you appear to other people? - The death of the party? - It's all a big joke to you, right? People expect civility from other people and that's the foundation of civilization. - You call the Bittermans civilization? - Yes, I do. They're just regular human beings trying to live in this world the way it is. I don't like the world the way it is, but I love you, Chlo. I love you too, Harry. But I can't be a part of this life that you insist I live. It's too much, you ask too much. You've made me a prisoner of your principles. Principle is everything. No, it's not. The world moves forward because people have mutual respect. They talk to each other, they negotiate, they compromise. You just can't stop yourself, can you? You just had to spout off? Spout off? Well, you know, that's it, that's it, that's what lady was talking about. She wasn't talking about saving the wheels, she was talking about saving the whales. [sighs] [chuckles faintly] [woman] Mr. March! [knocking on door] Mr. March! - [sighs] - [knocking on door] Mr. March! ♪♪ Harry March, I need to sell you a swimming pool. What are you talking about? Who are you? A swimming pool. Well, I'll give you two minutes. Cosiapara. - [Hector] Hey. - [woman] Come on. [Hector] Who's this? [woman] He loves me. He loves everybody but me. [Hector] Ah, it's true. He's precious. [groans] Mr. March, everyone around here says I could never sell you one of my dad's pools. My dad says so too. Everyone says you're mean and crazy. - They're right. - But I said, "No." "That old man is just waiting for a little brightness in his life." Oh, in the form of a swimming pool? You said it. What you need to cheer up your cranky and miserable self is a new gunite pool installed with expert craftsmanship and tender loving care by the Leonardo Da Vinci of Hamptons pool makers and servicers, Tony Amberson. - Is that your father? - My father. [Hector] Ah, A pool would be nice. Miss, I'm very busy, I have a lot of important things to do. I don't really have any desire for a swimming pool. I have nobody to impress. If I want to take a swim, I do it right off my dock and if I want warm water, I take a bath. Good for you, but I must tell you, I don't think you're seeing this issue clearly. You are thinking of a swimming pool narrowly as a place to exercise or lull about. And speaking of exercise, if you don't mind my saying so, you could use some. [Hector] I like this girl. I do mind, your two minutes are almost up. Think of a swimming pool instead as a notable room of your house. Think of it as your indoor body of water, your pond, your lake, your estuary. What, may I ask, is more beautiful than a body of water? The light dance of the ripples, the shadows on the waves, the brooding darkness underneath. You know, you have a mind far more estimable than I thought. Why are you wasting it selling swimming pools? I mean a daughter's duty to her father aside. It never is aside. My dad's having a hard time of it, I mean moneywise. Moneywise, is this your full-time occupation? This semester. Then, it's back to St. John's in Annapolis. Oh, the great books curriculum, I thought so. You, my dear girl, are an anachronism. [chuckles] Just like you. Yes but I think I've earned that status. - You're much too young. - Maybe. But it looks better on me. - [Harry chuckles] - [Hector] Can't argue with that. You know, Harry, when I was in high school, I had a clear choice of extracurricular activities, be an anachronism, spend time in old movies, listen to jazz, live at the library or give blow jobs to the doped up future actuaries of America. Oh. [chuckles] [Hector] What's an actuary? So I went to classes most of the day and lived at the town library most of the night. Are you sure you don't want to buy a swimming pool? It's a great investment. Well, I got fixated on Samuel Johnson. First, I read Boswell. Then, I read Johnson. The lives of the poets, the prose, the poems, the best of which is - The Vanity of Human Wishes. - The Vanity of Human Wishes. "When a man is tired of London--" "He is tired of life." "He's not a patron, my Lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water." "And when he's reached the ground encumbers him with hope." [Hector] Brilliant. What brought you to Dr. Johnson? His devotion to the power of reason. He wasn't a romantic. Romantics ruin the world. And of course, he was always right. You're more than an anachronism. You show real value. [chuckles] Not like that monster over there. - Lapham? - You know him? No, I don't know anyone who's even seen him. He's a ghost like you. What do you know about me? What I see, what others say, but mainly what I see, a man who has whittled his life to too fine a point, too brittle. He doesn't write anymore. Now he's reduced to the stupidity of a sage. Towering in the confidence of 21. [chuckles] Do you have an answer for everything? Yes. Look, I don't want to fight with you. There's something wrong with quarreling when we're speaking of the person we both admire. - Well, how about it? - Nope. - Three easy installments. - Nope. - Come on, be a sport. - Nope. - Miss Polite said that you would-- - What did you say? Miss Polite said? Miss Polite said? Well, young Dr. Johnson, what did Ms. Polite say? When you sell your papa's swimming pools, darling, do you know what you're selling? You're selling real estate. Now I already have a pool so you'll make no sale with me, but tell you what, you sell a pool to Harry March, that nutcase writer on that island over there, you sell Mr. March a pool and I'll pay you for an extra one, one for the price of two. And just why did Miss Polite say she wanted me to buy a swimming pool? Because a swimming pool will do two things for the estimable Mr. March. It'll make his property more valuable, thus more sellable. And as soon as he buys it from you, he'll hate it, which is when he'll sell his island to me. Just when I thought I'd met one incorruptible soul. - Dr. Johnson-- - Would've done the same thing. He was poor like me. He wouldn't have sold his principles for a swimming pool. You never know what poor people will do. ♪♪ Are you coming back? Are you buying a pool? By the way, you're not an 18th century man. I thought you'd like to know. What do you mean? You're a romantic. You live on an island. You create your own ideal world. You despise or ignore the real world. You belittle life as it is and you feel superior to others. What do you suppose that makes you? Lonely. [Hector] Harry! [sighs] - I don't see any horse hair. - No horse hair. [Hector] Well, at least you knocked down half the house. I mean it wasn't a total loss. I'm outta here. [Kevin] Harry! [hammer thuds on floor] [distant thunderclap] - Harry! - [Harry groans] Lot of banging going on in there. You all right? You okay? How's Jack doing? [sighs] You know Jack's 17, he's sensitive. Don't change the subject, Harry. What's going on? You look like shit. You're acting crazy. You're talking to Hector. You're lucky he's not talking back to you. [Hector] If he only knew. [thunderclap] You need to get some help, Harry. Like what? Like therapy, talk to someone, you don't know how to deal with people. I would, I'd see a shrink but I don't know how to deal with people. Hold on, I'll be right back. [Harry groans] [Harry coughing] Hey! - What is this? - It's a bribe. I want you to stop working on Lapham's house. - [chuckles] That's good. - I don't take bribes. Well, it's for Jack, it's for film school. You think I don't hear the both of you arguing every day? Well, we'll figure it out, I can't accept this. I told you, it's not for you. Tell Jack it's a loan. He can pay me back with the profits from his first movie, which should be no higher than the value of the loan, that way we'll guarantee it'll be an art house film. - Harry-- - I gotta go, I'm busy, very, very busy.

On the night when he lived the words he so desperately wanted to write, he felt as he should look his very best. Also, just in case Chloe was still mingling at the Lapham's party or if he should make the front page of the local Southampton press his old blue shirt wouldn't suffice.

[thunderclap] [Harry] I take this post mortem opportunity nevertheless to tell you about the lecture I could not deliver in person. My lecture was to be about Lapham, my sordidly ambitious, absurdly self-important, ears splittingly, noise making, unwanted neighbor, Lapham. For anything you want to know about the destructive witless 20th century, you may look to Lapham. But here comes the sad part of my lecture, dear Chautauquins, for I hoped to inform you that against all odds, I had defeated Lapham, reversed his upward progress or at the very least slowed him down, yet to my sorrow and embarrassment I must report not my victory, but rather his. Mine was the vanity of human wishes. What lesson may I bring you, my worthy Chautauquins? The lesson is this, the reason that Lapham has won this time and will win again and will always win is that you allow it. You sit together, but you do not stand together. Rise up, Chautauquins. Rise as Lapham is rising and smite him. Not with weapons, they will fail, take it from me, but rather with your books and your songs and your laughter. Beat him back with your modesty, the knowledge of frailty, that is to say with your humanity, or if you prefer you all can go out and live on your separate islands and seethe and fume and rant and go nuts in the company of your sarcastic, Bible-thumping dog. It worked for me. [thunderclap] [people shouting] Harry, Harry, what are you doing? What are you doing, Harry? Señor March, por favor. For Christ's sake, Harry! My...! My house! My house! Harry!
