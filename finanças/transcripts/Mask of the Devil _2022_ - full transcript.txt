You have to put this behind you if you're going to get better. Solomon had sinned. Solomon had turned his back on God. Don't tell me you knew about this, dad? I'm not an idiot, Sam! I can smell the sex on you! You do realise what needs to be done, don't you, Alan? ALAN: Are you alright, Sam? Yeah, sort of it. It's been a weird day.

That it can't be removed from this place without unleashing some sort of evil spirit. If we're all found here sir, then... -Well? Spit it out, man! -We're dead. Sir. You tell him from me that we will do no such thing! You tell him I've been searching for this place for the best part of two years, and I will absolutely not leave without what I came for! -Curse or not! -LADRAO: Sir.

[Sighs] You're unbelievable! You're meant to be my first. You know if you're not careful, Johnny, you're gonna lose me. I... I just think that we should wait until we're married. Pre-marital relations are the devil's work. I just wanna be like your parents. Married? Johnny, I'm 18. I won't be marrying. Look, the last thing I want to be like is my parents. Go home, Johnny.

Um, I'm looking for anything you might have that looks African? What kinda thing? I mean, what for? Well, um, just between you and me, I work in the film business, the adult film business. [Chuckles] And, uh, we're doing a parody version of Tarzan, and I need props and stuff to make it look authentic. So, Todd? Have you got anything? Necklace? Tribal shield? -Bit of illegal ivory? -No. We don't really have anything like that I'm afraid. Oh, that's a shame Todd. I could have done you an offer. You know, maybe, uh, a trip to the set? Meet some of the performers? In return for anything that might have worked, you know? Wait! I do have something that might work. Meet me out in the alley in ten minutes. She's got something, a mask, but she says it's never for sale, so we gotta keep it quiet, you know? -[Door bell dinging] -[Laughter over TV] -[Laughs] -[Vomits] [Laughs] WOMAN ON TV: Take dinner out of the oven, I'll be there in a minute.

Uh, you're not going anywhere dressed like that, young lady. -MARY: Dad?! -No arguments! -But Dad, Todd's going! -MARY'S DAD: Todd's a boy! He can look after himself. You're not leaving this house looking like some two-bit jezebel, do you understand me, young lady? -But dad-- -While you live under my roof, and I pay the rent, what I say goes! Now, go and get some proper clothes on! What you mean is you don't want me to have fun? That's right! No fun! Not in my house! [Groans] What? That's right! My house. [Indistinct chatter over TV] And don't slam the doors in my house! I'll get my own damned place! [Screams] [Laughs] You know I don't like carrots! [Knocks on door] -Yo! What's up, dickcheeese? -Go fuck yourself. Already did. Gotta clean the pipes before a big night out. Look... [Sighs] You know what your problem is? Respect. You ain't got none 'cause you don't give none. He was the same with me 'til I got a job. I'll, er... tell everyone you said hi. [Laughs] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] ROOSH: Jerry, no. No, Jerry! I know you're trying, but listen, but... Listen, I don't wanna do another one of these movies. Because they're tired. Yeah, but the last one barely sold 5,000 copies. And Bunny's way past her best, I mean way past. And to be honest, I'm sick to death of seeing Frank's ginger cock and balls in my edit suite every day. But can't you get me another gig? [Sighs] A TV spot for incontinence pads?! Are you taking the piss? No! That's not what I wanted! [Knock on door] Look, Jerry, I gotta go. Yeah, I, uh, got... I got an interview today with a new girl. Yeah, alright. Hi! Uh, I'm not really sure I'm in the right place? Literally, or metaphorically, honey? [♪♪♪] Take a seat, you're here for the interview, right? Good. My name's Ken, but everyone around here calls me Roosh. -And you are...? -Mary. Mary. Good, at least you got that right. And you know this is just a fluffer's position for now? Er, yeah. But I don't really know what you'll be needing. I've never really done this before. Good. Well, you'll be helping out in all departments. Lending a hand or a mouth, wherever necessary. -And you are 18? -Yeah. Uh, yeah. Good. Right, I can offer 300 a day in cash, but you have to start tomorrow. -Any questions? -Yeah, uh, Ken... -Roosh. -Roosh, that is a phallic. Look, adult films. For adults. Look, you'll never be seen, it's purely a fluffing gig. And the money's really good. Especially for someone your age. -I'm not sure-- -Look, they're just films. They're there to serve a particular audience. They are proper films. [Exhales] And no one will ever find out. At least that's what I keep telling myself. Okay? See you at 07:00 am tomorrow. -Don't be late. -Thank you. Thank you, Ken. -Roosh. -Roosh. -Don't let me down. -Thank you. Oh, and, uh, wear something comfortable, no push up bras. Some of the lads can get a little bit over excited if you look good, okay? [Sighs] Fucking newbies. MARY'S MUM: Hello, sweetie. How was school? Uh, great, Mum. Guess what? I got a job. At a film production company. I'm the assistant. Is that a good idea, honey, with your exams coming up? And what's your father going to say? I'll be fine. I just wanna get him off my back. He said that when I can start paying my own way, he'd let me do what I want. How exciting. I sometimes wish that I'd had a job, but your father would never allow it. Too much to do around the home all the time. I want the independence. I wanna get out, I wanna see the world. I can't let him control me forever. I understand, darling. So, what will you have to do? What film are they making? It's a bit vague. Ah, just helping out whenever anybody needs me to, that sort of thing. Just gotta suck it and see. But there might be some content that you might not approve of or dad. Oh, baby! Your father and I have seen all sorts of films over the years. Some of them that we could never tell our church friends about! Your father thought that "Brokeback Mountain" was a masterpiece but, you know, he could never say anything. He thinks that makes him sound like a, you know, a "gay." Well, I'm sure if it's God's will, you'll take to it like a duck to water. And no need to say anything to your father about it just yet. Maybe don't mention it to him ever? And here love, get your hair done for your first day. [♪♪♪] [Birds chirping] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] -Oh. Oh. -KIMMY: Oh, shit! I'm sorry! [Kimmy sighs] You must be Chardonnay's replacement? Mary, right? [Sighs] Good. So, let's grab all this shit you just made me drop and put it on that table over there. [♪♪♪] [Thuds] You okay? Come on, let me introduce you to the gang. You ever done this before? -Uh, no. No. -Don't worry. Everyone's gotta start somewhere. Thing's you gotta remember, that whatever you see here today, we're making art. Like art for commerce, for a very specific audience, namely white, middle-income boys aged 14 to 25 with little imagination, and less intelligence. I mean, if they had any of those things, they wouldn't be watching this shit, would they? And quick and easy gratification, that's why we're all here. Simple plot. Performers that people recognise. No challenge intellectually, and all culminating in gallons of bodily fluids. No subtext, no incredible dialogue. You got it? Right, so this is Milo, he deals with lights and camera. And Mike. Sound man and total fucking pervert. Stay away from him unless absolutely necessary. -Sorry, what's that? -Uh, this is Mary, the new girl. Oh, hello Mary, good to meet you. If you want to join us for a beer after work, we'd really enjoy that? Fucking lesbian! [Door closes] [Kimmy sighs] Billie and Debbie, makeup and talent. Hey honey, welcome! You're gonna have to get used to seeing a lot more of her than that, sweetie! [Smacks lips] Julius and Otto, male talent. Yeah, never a good idea to get involved with the male talent, so probably best you don't make eye contact when you're, uh... working. I'm not sure about this, Kimmy. [Sighs] Mary, Mary. Listen, just block it out. How much are you getting paid today? -Three hundred. -Three hundred? That's amazing! What you gonna spend that on? I, uh... I want to move out of my parents' house. Move out? That's amazing! I'm so proud of you, standing on your own two feet. Sticking it to your dad, I bet? Good for you! Oh, uh, you've met Ken, haven't you? Yes, so, Ken told me to tell you that Chardonnay, who used to do your job. Well, she kinda did get involved with the male talent, so yeah-- just don't make eye contact, okay? Okay? Right, any questions? -Kimmy? -Hey, sweetie! Ready for your time to shine? Uh, I-- me-- I didn't realise that I was-- Sure, but you know what you're doing, right? I mean, you've, you know? Oh! Yeah! Yeah. Loads, loads. You know, you only have to do it for a minute or two -before each take? Okay? -Mm-hmm. And the money's good, right? Really good! You might wanna do a quick trial run. Some of these guys, they can get pretty eager. [Indistinct chatter] [♪♪♪] So, I managed to get some pretty cool props. Okay. Perfect. And I thought maybe we could put one of the guys in this for the first part of the opening scene? [♪♪♪] [Thuds] Kimmy, how much did you spend on all this? -Oh, 200 for the lot. -Two hundred? Jesus Christ what are we gonna do with all this shit?! Well, you're the one who wanted production value? No one give a shit about production value! All they wanna see is dick, pussies, tits and arseholes. -What about the mise-en-scene? -Fuck your mise-en-scene! We're not making Jurassic fucking Park here! Get this shit out of my office, especially that! Come on, move it! And make sure Debbie's lubed up and ready in ten. I'm not paying another fucking doctor's bill for friction burn! Fuck. [Sighs] -Are you okay? -I'm fine. [Coughs] When are we gonna get this fuck party started?! -Oh, fuck off, Mike! -Fucking lesbian! [Exhales] Look, I'm sorry. Can you just take this box and put it in the green room please? [Exhales] -[Knocks on door] -Come! [Door squeaking] Uh, Kimmy asked me to put these in here? Oh? Uh, anywhere will do. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Breathes heavily] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Get yourself together. Get yourself together. [Exhales] [♪♪♪] No. No. No. [Dialtone ringing] JOHNNY OVER CELLPHONE: Hey beautiful, how's your first day? Hey! Um, I don't think this is the right job for me. JOHNNY OVER CELLPHONE: Why? What's up? Nothing... yet. That's the issue. [Nervous chuckle] JOHNNY OVER CELLPHONE: Look, sometimes we just gotta do these things. You know, like... it's God's will. Are you playing a fucking game? JOHNNY OVER CELLPHONE: Uh, who, me? No, no baby, I just-- take that! You're playing a fucking computer game, and you're not even listening to what I'm saying! JOHNNY OVER CELLPHONE: Look, no, no, babe, I mean-- I, I paused it now. What's wrong? Arsehole! [Groans] [♪♪♪] [Indistinct chatter] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] MIKE: Oh, hey, tea's up! [♪♪♪] Mary, isn't it? -Do you have a boyfriend? -Yeah. Yes, Johnny. [Laughs] Only if she insists! Isn't that right everybody?! [Laughs] Do you also have a little lamb? [Indistinct chatter] You know, fleece as white as snow? [Laughs] Because I'm a big, bad wolf. [Screams] My fucking balls! [Pants] Oh, that's what they're for! -Thank you. -No need. It's degrading enough working here already, without fraternising with the fanboys too. Ginger nut? -Sorry? -Would you like a ginger nut? Uh, no thank you. We're not all wrong 'uns, you know? My kids. Max, Liam, and Cody. We're all just here to make a bit of money. -Woowoo! Haaa! -Wait. Can you just...? OTTO: Whoo ha! Okay. That's all I can do for you I'm afraid, Otto. [Sighs] Do you want a water or anything? -Otto does not need fluids. -Okay. [Clicks tongue] [♪♪♪] Come on people, turn 'em off, hand 'em in! [cellphones beeping] Come on, you too "fresh meat." They fuck up the sound honey.

Listen up. You hearing me? Okay, so what I think we'll do is we'll start off with missionary first. And then we'll go to cowgirl, okay? And then I want reverse cowgirl. And then after that I want some-- yeah doggy. After that we need to definitely make sure we get this. Are you listening? Definitely make sure we get this, okay? And then I want to go to... a bit of spooning. After that... I want piledriver. Then I want oyster, eagle, and then you splash the cash. Got it? Uh, yeah. Yeah, boss. -Sure? -Sure. You changed your hair? Julius? You're up. [Soft grunt] Well, come on! He's not gonna blow himself!

Everyone ready? -Turn over. -MIKE: Sound's speed. And action! [Mary sighs] KIMMY: Come on. Come on, let's get you some water. [Debbie groaning, moaning] Slow it down. JULIUS: [Grunting] Oh, fuck! Julius, go deeper. Go on, hit her. [Gasps] ROOSH: And cut! Right, everyone take five. Stay wet and warm! -You gonna be okay? -I think so. -What the fuck was that? -I'm sorry. Do you want that 300 quid or what? I do, I do. I just-- I didn't realise-- While I pay the bills around here, you do as I say. -Yeah. -You got it? Yes sir. Right. Go outside, have a smoke, and when you're ready and you've sorted your shit out, get your arse back on my set. I hate to say it, but he's kinda right, you know? If you've got bills to pay, you've just gotta do it, leave your integrity at the door, you know? And I won't be around the whole time to look after you. Hey! Need a hand getting ready for the scene deep throat? [Laughs] Yeah. Fucking lesbian! [Roosh sighs] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Soft grunt] [Wild, uncontrollable screaming] ROOSH: What is it? What the fuck?! I don't know. Debbie found her like this. [Debbie crying] Well, where's Otto, and Kimmy? Has anyone called an ambulance? Oh, for fucks sake, the fucking phones are on the fucking set! Pillock!
