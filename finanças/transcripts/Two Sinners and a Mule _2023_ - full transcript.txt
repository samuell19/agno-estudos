That'll do you, bounty hunter. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Come on, now! Go! Whoa. No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! I'm gonna get things rolling. No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! Let's get this thing started. No more whores! Three dollars. No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! Getting a little tense in here. No more whores! No more whores! You know, it ain't right, them folks making all that fuss over a man getting a poke. In my experience, that's exactly what a man and a woman were made for. Hey, Nora. Are you gonna play cards? Or stare at them the rest of the day? Hold your dang horses, sheriff. I'm thinkin'. No more whores! No more whores! All right, I'll see your three. One, two, three. And I'll raise you two. Let's make this a real game. I'm in. I can tell you're something else. - Get me a drink? - Sure. Mm. No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! No more whores! Need to take care of some things for a while. - You got things here? - Sure. But don't be gone too long, though, you hear? The way I see it, poker's like making love. It's better if you go all in. Ain't that right, Nora? That's right. Alice? Could we have another round of whiskey now? You know, it's never gonna be the same as it was. Mm. I've lived quite a good life. I've had some successes and some not so. But there is one thing I've learned. If you ever get in an argument with a woman... There's two methods. Two. And neither of them work. I-- I fold. Don't look like your card playing's working either. The way I see it, if you're gonna get screwed, might as well be with a woman and not from cards. I call. With all that charm that you have, it ain't gonna do you no good when you see these. Two pair, kings and threes. A hearty man ate a toad. Sheriff! I just saw one of those hussies going in my husband's office! Huh? You gonna do something about it or not? Yes, ma'am. Duty calls. Mm. Yes, ma'am. She's in here, sheriff. I know she is! I saw her come in with my own eyes! If you're in here, Nora, come on out. Oh, my God. Good God almighty. Oh! You best get out of here. Mayor, put your pants on. I'm gonna need some help hefting up your wife. She ain't exactly underfed. Give me a hand. The boys and I made a collection last night. Bought this for ya. That Grimes gang is terrorizing the countryside and no telling what's gonna happen if, uh, if you run into them. But if you run into trouble, trouble tends to think twice before rearing its head and finds a loaded rifle pointing at him. So it's yours and it is loaded. Much obliged. Thank you, sheriff. Those that sell their bodies sell their souls! Harlots! We don't need your kind around here. Ma'am, they're leaving, they're getting ready to go. Go on back, ladies. Don't get nasty. A plague has been lifted from our town. Hallelujah, praise the Lord! If we're all so fired wicked, what's that make their husbands? I'll bet that makes them our best customers on a Saturday night. Aw, damn. Get up, get these out of here, deputy. Yes, sheriff. Damn. Anyone that throws something at me again, they're gonna end in jail, or get the back of my hand! Damned old biddies. Personally, girls... Um... I like you. As a matter of fact, I like both of you. Yeah! Especially on a Saturday night when you like to, you know, - unlace those corsets and... - Easy. Easy, Nora. Nora. Let's not be saying something out of school. You girls be careful. Thanks, sheriff. Sorry, Alice. I never meant for us to get the boot. It's all right. I was fixing to leave this place anyway. Maybe open up a business. You know, a restaurant, or change my life around or something. Hey, Nora, leaving town? Yeah, it's about time we got out of this shithole of a town. Well, I'll need to know where you're going and soon. 'Cause I can't wait for it, Nora. And you, Alice. Cowboys are so easy. Yeah. Yes, that's what got us into this predicament, if I recall. Come on, Jolene. Bye, boys. Sad to see 'em go, sheriff? Not as sad as I'm gonna be Saturday night. We'll miss you! I'll never win a card game again. So... have you heard from what's-his-face? - Not yet. - Mm-hmm. Alice. Oh! Oh! I knew you'd come. Didn't think I was gonna let you leave town without telling me goodbye, did you? Oh, it don't have to be goodbye, not as long as you keep holding me tight and promise never to let me go. How's your wife, Orin? - What-- - She's fine. Wait, you-- you haven't left her yet? Alice, when the time is right, I will, I promise. When's that gonna be, Orin? Soon, real soon. I promise. When you get somewhere, settled, write me, please. I'll come for ya, I promise. I swear on a stack of Bibles, I will. - Please. - If you say so, Orin. You really believed he was gonna come for you, didn't you? Hah. That man's had a hook in you ever since you came to this town. He just reels you in whenever he wants a bite. You can see that now, can't you? He always treated me like a lady. Hah! Wake up, honey. Orin's like any other fella, all talk. Ain't no man ever kept his word to a whore. Hey, Orin! Kiss my ass! - Do you think he's... - Nah. We'd smell him if he was. We ought to help him out. It'd be the Christian thing to do. Since when did you get religious? Ah-- Since we got kicked out of town. I mean, maybe it's the good Lord's way of saying that it's time for a change. What has that got to do with helping this fella? Love thy neighbor? That's what got us kicked out of town in the first place. Well, you sure didn't make things easy messing around with the mayor. Hey. You got your lady's companion? Always do. Oh... Hey. Hey, mister. You all right? You think he'd be out here in the middle of nowhere left for dead if he was? If you don't button your lip, you'll be right here on the ground with him. Savvy? So much for love thy neighbor. Man. He has got more holes in him than a billiard table. He breathing? - Help me out here. - Hey. You still wanna help him? We can't condemn a man without hearing his side of things first. But-- Best to hold on to that, just in case. He ain't no Sunday preacher. Not with six notches in his gun. We can put him on your horse, you can ride double with me. I bought Old Bob for me, not what's-his-nuts here. Riding double's never bothered you before. That was different. I was getting paid. Well, I'll owe ya. Jolene's already packing too much weight as it is. You sure about this? Yes, now quit letting go of him. - Help me. - Oh-- You just let one man drop you like a baked potato fresh from the oven, and now you wanna start taking up with another. Would you come on? It is hot enough to pop corn out here and we need to find some shade. Come on. There... - How's he looking? - Well... being dragged the way he was, dirt plugged the hole. There's a slug in there that needs to come out. The other shot looks like it went clean through. Don't look like no vitals was hit. Seeing as how you got his pants off and all, how's he look down yonder? And don't tell me you didn't sneak a peek 'cause I know you did. Well? Why are you so interested all of a sudden? Professional curiosity. What caliber we talking here? .22? .38? It's a .44. Any notches on it? In case you forgot, we are trying to get out of that line of business. You are. I like what I do. Besides, proper ladies get poked by fellas too, don't they? Sure they do, but if my scheme pans out, you'll only have to bed down with the ones you want to. No more toothless gummers or fat guys or saddle trash. Just gentlemen of your choosin'. I mean, "lady" always had more of a ring to it than "lewd woman," don't you think? You and rings. Ever since I known you, you been hung up on them. The brass ring. Wedding ring. What's it gonna be next, the three-ring circus? Go fetch me that skinning knife out of Old Bob's saddle bag, will you? And, uh... Oh, and a flask of whiskey and a tin cup. Where'd you learn doctorin'? I didn't. Here goes nothing. Ah! Mister! Mister! You have got a sizable hunk of lead in you that I was about to take out, but if you wanna keep it, I can leave it be. Whiskey, please. Thank you. Ohh... All right. All right, let's do it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Come on. Let's see... What are you doing? Huh? Start with the back. Don't need any more holes being put in me. Slow and steady until you hit something solid. - That'll be the bullet. - All right. Ohh. - I got it! - You're awful tender for a man who looks like he spends a lot of time in rough country. There you are, mister. Hah. You know, deep down, men ain't nothing but big babies. I mean, all that fuss for just one little old bullet? Best get a fire going. Well, I must say I am obliged for the food and the doctorin'. You was in a pretty rough way when we found you, mister... Uh, Gallup. Eldon Gallup. This place ain't fit for belly crawlers and buzzards, let alone people. What are you doing out here anyway? Suppose I could ask you the same question, huh? Hm? What are ya, a hired gun? We saw them notches on your pistol. You did? Yes, I, uh... I do make a living with my gun. But I ain't never been hired out. Speaking of which, where the hell's my gun? Hm? You a bounty hunter? Why don't you check my pocket? If you dare. This, uh... "Gila Grimes..." Looks like quite a peach. What'd he do to warrant a reward for 2,000 dollars? Oh, wow. Hmm... Tsk. Nothing fit to mention in front of a lady. He the one that shot you? Well, I reckon so, though I imagine that was a bit hard to say. Shot me in the back, Miss, uh... Oh, I'm Alice. This here's Nora. Nora. Beautiful. Looks like he got quite a jump on you. Who was stalking who, huh? I underestimated him. And it damn near got me killed, but it's a mistake I won't make twice, that's for sure. Uh... I know for a fact he is holed up in this God-forsaken hellhole somewhere. I never met a man hunter before. You know, Mr. Gallup, you could say we're in a related line of work. Though the men are usually hunting after us. Oh, no. Just my luck. Do not tell me y'all are whores. - Sportin' gals. - Soiled doves. High desert hussies, - and about a dozen other crude names... - Whores. ...you could call two women working in the world's oldest profession. We were kicked out of town by the women's decency league. Whose beds do you think their husbands' boots were under? Wasn't their wives, I'll tell you that much. Wow. You must be so proud. Any worker worth their wages takes pride in what they do. We're headed up to Virginia City. We're looking for a higher and better road to follow. Mm, yeah, well, I mean, I bet you're awful saddle sore after a profession like that. We wanna open up a restaurant. We're gonna call it the Horny Toad. That's right. The Horny Toad. Very catchy name. There is a silver strike up there and all them miners is gonna need a place to eat. You know what they'll also need? A place to poke! Oh, just stick with what you're good at. My mom always did. Those days are over for me. I wanna open up a respectable place for respectable people. Respect, though, is hard to come by. Well, I like just being me. Same here. Oh, shit, that hurt. I'm gonna call it a night. I've been shot at, been carved up by some whore playing pretend doctor, just... it's too much. It's too much. You know, I have never met a man that spent so much time on his back. - Yeah. Maybe he's a whore too. - Damn right I am. Best in the business. - ...to get like this. - No, we don't. - It's just gonna be a minute... - Okay. What are you two sisters in sin whispering about, huh? Stick your foot down. We just been discussing your predicament. This here Grimes fella. You ain't in no shape to take him on by yourself. And what the hell do you two even know about chasing a man like Grimes? Oh, we've had our fair share of bad men. Wow, that's gratitude for ya. Save a man's life and he starts laughing and calling you names. Ow. We'll help you. For half the bounty. Half? Half. Half? If I could stand up, I would fall down laughing. Half. I never heard such a thing. Crazy. Without us, you'll probably die of sunstroke. - Snake bite. Starve. - Gangrene. Die of thirst. Wow, glad you guys are all so concerned about me. - Well, thank you. Thank you. - Oh, mind us, honey. - You need us. - I need you? I need you like I need syphilis. You need our stock, our supply and our help. 'Cause without 'em, you're buzzard bait and you know it. What'll it be, Eldon? Fine. Stay here and die if you like. It ain't no skin off our nose. Ugh! Damn it. Ah, is that a yes? Well, not like I have much of a choice. Y'all had me over a barrel. It was a horse, if you don't remember. I don't. Well, would you look at that? I guess you needed us more than you realized. You actually gonna ride in that dress? Don't you worry about my ridin'. I ride just fine. Ask any man from Socorro to Santa Fe. They'll tell you. Well, well, well. A couple of whores in a tizzy. I thought I killed you. You're not the only one taking risks out here, you know. We don't even know if we can trust you. Bit of free advice. Don't trust no one but yourself. Less likely to be let down. This is a damn fool's errand, is what it is. What the hell do you two know about chasing hard men, anyway? Oh, giggle all you want, that's fine. Ain't gonna be a cathouse parlor game. Grimes. Last time we tangled, he damn near killed me. He ain't gonna bat an eye rubbing out the likes of you two. Go on, see how much laughing you do when that lead starts flying. - Yeah. - What's wrong there, Mr. Gallup? Desert got you all hot and bothered? Nope, just you. Do you know where we're going? Hell in a handbasket. You don't much like us now, do you? - Leave him be, Nora. - I'm just trying to make conversation. Going into business with someone's like going to bed with them. The more you know about them, the easier it'll be when things get rough and tumble. Nora, is it? Ain't gotta worry about catching me in your bed. You ain't exactly my kind of woman. Besides, I never pay for it. Never will. You couldn't afford me anyway. You got that right. I ain't got but ten cents to my name. You got something against whores? Mm, not until I met one, I didn't. I was just a-- a young buck, ventured into a house of ill repute. Went upstairs with this tender young thing. Then what? Well, she, uh, rolled me right down to my socks. You can't judge a whole profession based on what one greedy whore did. Greedy and whore now them two words they go together just fine, don't they? Kinda like bounty hunter and scum. You sound a bit soured on women. Well, believe it or not, under all the dirt, sand and stubble, there's a handsome face that has... - has caught the fancy of many a young lady. Oh, too bad ain't none of them here right now. I never met a man as cocky and full of himself as you. - Shh, shh, shh. - Don't hush me. I can speak if I want to. - You're not the boss of us and-- All right, easy, love. All right, all right. Whoa. Well, I'm gonna go ahead and venture a guess and say not so good. I reckon you're right. Hold on. Let me jump down here. I got you. Wow. This oughta do the trick. - There we go. - Jesus! Well, this canteen's bone-dry. Well, we should be at the water hole by tomorrow sundown. All right? Well, that doesn't do me any good. I'm thirsty right now. Well, you can do a little rain dance. Huh? See how far that gets you. What about Grimes? Ain't he have to be coming after us any minute now down that trail? No. His-- his horse took one hell of a chili-wanger. Snake hole. No, he ain't going anywhere any time soon. Except by foot maybe. We'll settle with him later. Can you, um, can you help me up? - You sure you're fit to ride? - No. But that one, she's thirsty right now, so we don't got a choice. Alice, we're riding with a damn child. Come on, here you go. Okay, let's go. Whoa. I won't be needing this damn thing anymore. Is there a reason we're stopping or do you just wanna admire the dirt? Well, Alice was right. Tsk. If y'all are gonna help me hunt down Grimes, you need to learn how, all right? It is a two-step process. Shootin', survivin'. I thought you said that you could bring him back dead or alive. Dead's just easier. Let's see what you got. Let's see if you can hit that cactus down yonder. - Okay. - All right? Uh-huh. Wow. All right, let's just-- plenty of that. Next! She kicked your ass. Where'd you learn to shoot like that? Most fathers give their little girls pretty little things, but not my daddy. When I turned 13, he got me my first Henry rifle to help fill the stew pot with coons, turkeys, possums. You name it, I plucked 'em and plugged 'em. You ever draw down on a man, though? - No. - Pulled the trigger? No. Might just get your chance. Here we go. Let's try this again. All right. All right. Let's see what you got. All right, now slow down a little bit. - I know. - Just-- You need to put two hands up there, okay, keep both eyes open. Breathe. Easy. Uh-huh. All right, well, let's try spreading the legs a little bit. Like you got a man in between there. Keep your eyes on it. Mm-hmm. All right, well, that wasn't a full-on hit, though, - but it was pretty close! - Oh! Maybe just, uh... Well, maybe you might've got a ricochet. Huh. Oh, well. - Huh? - Jesus! "I ain't afraid to love a man. I ain't afraid to kill him neither." Annie Oakley said that. I don't know who that is, but I'd rather her here than you. Give me that damn thing. - Where is Alice? - In the bushes. What do you think? I think it's time to go. Hey. Want coffee? You really want some? Get it yourself. I ain't at your beck and call, am I? Well, boss... I would offer you some coffee, but you done went and shot the shit out of the pot. I thought you'd have somethin with a bit more bite in it, you old rattler. Well, for you. Yeah. - Shot the coffee pot. You know, boss, you got any other urges that need to be satisfied. Figures. Coochy coo! Young and tender, just like you like 'em. You better watch that one, bud. She might bite off more than you reckon. Besides, I like pain before pleasure. I have a bounty hunter that's been dogging me. You planning on turning the tables on him, boss? Turning and burning and leaving the bastard squirming. I think I'm gonna give him a lead smile. I need a horse. Well, go ahead and take mine there, boss. I'll ride up here in the wagon. Ohh... Hey, uh, you boys keep her warm for me, will you? Whoa! We don't mind obliging you there, boss. - Do we, boys? - Yeah. No, not at all, man. Yeah. See you, boss. Laters. Yeah. We'll see you down the road. Hold up. Ow. Just hold up. You guys can go ahead. - I got some business to attend to. - - Yeah. How long are you gonna take? I don't know. As long as it takes. Wanna write a book? - Yeah. - Yeah? Called "The Shit I Put Up With." First chapter's on you, Mr. Trot. - Gallup. It's Gallup. - Mm. - Best remember that. - Yeah. Sure. Mm-hmm. - Whatever. - Mm. Unless you wanna give me a hand. Oh, no, thank you very much, sir. Disgusting. Jolene, good girl. - You know what a Comanchero is? - Uh-uh. You don't wanna find out. - I think you're right. Okay. - Come on. All right... Stay calm. - No! - Stop right there, ladies. This way. Take her in. - Good girl. - Let's go. - Alice, just do what they say. - Shut up. - No, no! - Let's go. Come on, come on. Damn. - Come on, this way, ladies. - Let's go. Come on, let's go. If it ain't one thing, it's another. Get up there. You get up here. Huh? What do you got there? Little lady's companion? Are you hiding something too? - Wouldn't you like to know? - Oh, I'm gonna know. You got something in here? What do we got here? - Wouldn't you like to know? Hmm? - What's this? Huh? What you hiding? Jiminez. Get over there. Just get in the wagon. - No, no! No! - Come on. Get in! - Get! - No! No! No! Need a hand there, cabrón ? Hyah! Get off of her, you filthy pig! Lookie here, boys. - We got us a wildcat in here. - No! Well, smile, darlin'. You're about to have the time of your life! No! No! No! Hyah! Hyah! Why don't you, uh, sing us some music? Because it's about to get real romantic back here. No! No! Stop! No... - Hyah! - Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Gun belts, keys. - Hyah! - Damn it! Come on! Giddy up! Giddy up! Giddy up! Giddy up! Come on! Hyah! Get him! Get him! Ugh! Fuck! You know what I'd give for a shot of snakebite right about now? I'd give my two big toes. Yeah. Didn't the driver have a bottle of something or other? - Yep, yep. Coming up. - Oh! Check the wagon too. I think our pistol and rifle were in there. - Here. Al. - Thanks, Nora. - Here. - Aren't you a sweetheart? Dammit. You know what I did right there? - What? - How are you still standing? I can hold my liquor. The sun is about to set, so we should-- We should take off 'cause we got miles to cover. We got miles to cover. Let's go, gals! Yeah. Yeah. You sure about that? Sure. Sure. Sure, I'm sure. Mm. It's funny. I ain't never seen a man spend more time fallin' off his horse than ridin' it. Well, boys, at least the birds ain't gonna peck your eyes out. You know, if Grimes is worth 2,000 dollars, his gang must be worth something, right? What do you think? Leather or lace? One's definitely more practical than the other, especially out here. Yeah. You're right. Lace it is. What are you looking at? Admiring the scenery. Ain't illegal, is it? If'n it was, you'd be guilty as sin. I got urges, same as every other man. Once you two are done gallivanting around, we should make a fire. It's colder than a whore's heart out here tonight. No offense, though. You still wanna go through with this? I'm tired of whoring, Nora. I got more to offer this world than just a good time. You been listening to that bounty hunter far too much. If you don't love yourself, ain't nobody gonna love you. Honey, I've been loved by plenty of men plenty of times. Nora. Ain't nobody loved us. We just been used over and over again. And you know what? And someday, ain't nobody gonna wanna use us no more. You ever think about that? Well, you better start. 'Cause once you're all used up, death usually isn't too far off. Do you trust him? We need him, in more ways than one if we wanna get out of this thing. He proved that today. Well, I don't like him. He's pricklier than a bearcat. You don't have to like him. But I'd do what he says if you wanna live through this thing. And here I am without my gun. Where's Alice? I think she's just out collecting firewood. Why ain't you helping her? I thought it'd be nice to take a dip before it gets dark. Yeah. Well, unfortunately, it's not big enough for the both of us here, so... - Really? - Vamoose. I see plenty of room out here. - I seen you washing up earlier. - Yeah. - Yeah? - That was washin'. This is skinny-dippin'. Oh, relax! We're just two people baring our thoughts out here. Yeah, bare-ass naked. What are you trying to do to me? Huh? Huh. I think I just found your gun. I don't understand you. You know, most men would die for a night with me. But here I am, throwing myself at you and you just keep pushing me away. Yeah. People want what they can't have. It's a fact of life. What's wrong with me? Ain't I good-looking? Yep. Okay. Let's say I was interested. How many men you been with? I don't know. Last counted a hundred. You have any other skills besides pleasuring a man? Sure, I do. Yeah? Gimme just one. Well, I can, uh... You know, um... I'm really good at, uh... Yeah. That's what I thought. I mean, if you ain't a whore, then what are ya? Besides, what if-- what if Alice found us? I think she'd probably join us. We've shared men before. We just charge double for that. But seeing as you don't have any money, you know what I'll do? I'm willing to extend you a line of credit. Say... fifty dollars out of your share. I can get myself a good horse for 50 dollars. What's gotten into her? I think she's trying to figure that out. What's gotten into you? Howdy! Ain't you gonna do something? Well, I'm not exactly armed and dangerous at the moment. Honey, you don't happen to speak Apache, do you? Where did you learn to speak Apache? When I was little, my parents died on a trip out west. The Mescaleros took me in. - Apache were some of my first customers. - Really? What did you, uh... What did you say to him? Just, you know, you and I tried to make love but you couldn't get it up. Oh, well... Shit. I burned myself. They doing what I think they're doing back there? - Uh-huh. - Shit. You guys do your own makeup? What? You're not the only one who gets urges. Get yourself a new rifle? I did. - Yeah. - Ahem. Y'all have a good time? Wouldn't you like to know? Not really, I'm just being courteous. Oh, yeah. Oops. That's good. Adds to the flavor. What did you, uh-- what did you learn about our newfound friends here, huh? Well, um, they were asking about the Apache girl we were with. - Ah, they are, are they? - That's her father. Instead of fooling around with that, why don't you, uh, get back to the task at hand, which is Grimes? You don't wanna upset an armed Apache. Why not? Well, I don't trust 'em as far as I can throw 'em. You sure Grimes is coming out this way? This is the only watering hole. He's coming this way. Yeah, I'll take first watch Damn. Good night, Mr. Gallup. Well, I would say good night, but every night with you has been anything but... Don't shoot, it's only me. Aren't you lucky? What are you doing up? Oh, I couldn't sleep. - Here, I'll take that. - Ooh. Yeah. I brought you some strawberry preserves with some biscuits. Well, much obliged. Well, you and Nora, you are one hell of a pair. Sweet and sour. Yeah and you're all salt. Well, yeah. I suppose - I am an acquired taste. - Mm-hmm. Mm. Out here women ain't got much of a choice other than cookin', - teachin', marryin', or-- - Whoring? Yeah. Most men, they ain't looking to get hitched to the likes of me and Nora. Well... Hmm. You never fancied being a schoolmarm? Oh. No. No, I'd probably break my switch - the first day. - Oh. "Spare the rod, spoil the child." That's what my Pa used to say. Mm. Man, he was a drunk. A mean drunk. But still, I, uh... He hated himself more than he hated me. Why didn't you leave there? We had but one horse. Yeah. And if he caught me trying to steal it, he wouldn't hesitate to put a bullet in my back. But, you know, I figured out that he robbed a bank, killed a teller, and there was a bounty on his head. Yeah. So, he passed out one night, right? And I hog-tied him, stole his horse, and dragged his ass all the way to jail. Four hundred dollar bounty for that one. First one too. Hmm. Got me this gun, got a fast horse, I stayed for the hanging. After that, I just rode out of town. Never been back. Hmm. I came all the way from Georgia. My husband-to-be... He was one hell of a letter writer. It only took two before he had my head full of romantic notions. And, um... he said that he had a big ranch with all these cattle that could make any a dream I ever have wanted come true. Hm. You were a mail-order bride, huh? Never got around to the bride part. I will never forget the first time I laid eyes on him. He was just lying there in that pine box at the funeral parlor. Damn. What, uh... what happened? His neighbors, uh, they reckon that he... His horse spooked and he fell and hit his head on a rock. His neck was broke when they found him. But, well-- bright side you get his, uh... His spread, his cattle, right? Inherit all that. No. No, I... I would've been if we would've been married, but, um... His kin. They took everything, right down to the last heifer and it wasn't long before I needed a place to go and needed me a job. Yeah, that's tough. So, um, the cathouse, that was the... The only thing hiring, huh? When you're starving and you got no place to go, you do what you gotta do to survive. Here. It's just a question. Jesus. Hey. Get up. Hey! You weren't here when I got up last night. You two get horizontal? No! I brought him some biscuits. We talked. Well, if I didn't know you better, honey, I'd say you've lost your touch. I have. You know, if he was any more asleep, he'd be dead. Last night's coffee still in the cup? Sure is. It's cold, though. Suppose I could make some more. What the hell did you do that for? Just giving you a morning coffee. Always helps me get up and face the day. I prefer to drink it. In a cup. You know, I swear I saw some go down your throat. Where'd the Apache go? Same place we're headed. And hell ain't waitin'. Hyah! Ain't that strange? Tracks from another horse. Do you think Grimes could've gotten another horse? Don't know. You know, those Comancheros did say something about him. You're just telling us that now? My God. Here. Come on! Hyah, hyah, hyah! Hyah, hyah, hyah! Hyah, hyah! We can just camp up here. Ow. It's getting late. You'll feel better once you get some food and some rest in ya. You been riding hard all day. Well, take a load off. We'll make camp. Thanks, hon. Yeah, I think I could use some-- some shut-eye. Bust out the vittles, Nora. This train's coming to a stop. So what sounds good for supper, Mister-- Okay, so look, I, um... I just-- I wanna tell you something. Okay, but listen with both ears, 'cause I'm only gonna say it once. All right? Harder than I thought. Um... My preconceived notions about your career... Maybe they-- they blurred my vision some? I mean, I saw you for who you were, what you did. I mean, not-- not who you are. And it was damn shortsighted of me. And small-minded. Both, I guess. Um... I mean, I reckon that, you know, people, if they would-- they would take the time to see each other as they are, then... Well, there'd be a whole lot more meeting in the middle. A lot less pissed people off running around. Man, that's such a tangent, what are you talking about? Anyways, look, I... I thought I'd be better at this. Um... I just want you to know that I, uh... I've come to respect you. I really have. And I've come to, uh... I don't know. Admire you even. Maybe even love you, I guess. If you could see yourself with someone by the likes of me... That's it? Ah, what the hell you know. You old crow bait. Hey. How long you been standing there? We were just chatting about life. Come on. Sure can be lonely out here. You still thinking about Orin? Orin? Who's Orin? Old flame of hers. Yeah, those don't really burn out, do they? What? Old flames. They just keep on simmering. Months, years. Antelopes that run in the wind. Cheers to you. Where's she at now? With her ancestors, I reckon. She got, um, smallpox. We were, uh, trading down at Fort Lowell nigh on, uh... fifteen years ago. I would do anything, I would drop my guns if I could bring her back. That gal, she meant more to me than... You know, I'm not the crying kind, but... that just... that just crushed me, you know? But, I, uh... I will definitely shed a few tears of joy when I kill Grimes. Or maybe I'll just-- I don't know. Piss on his dead corpse. One or the other. I can't quite decide. It's more of a "in the moment" type of decision. Past noon and you haven't moved a muscle. Well, I suppose I was plum tuckered. Fit as a busted fiddle now, though. Hungry? Oh, damn! Hey, you wanna wash this up and I'll get some bacon on? Whoa! Scatter! You see him? If I did, he'd be dead. That you down there, Gallup? The one and only! You may as well give up, Grimes. I got two deputies from town with me, and they're both dead shots. Well, I ain't never seen no deputies with pointy tits! Pointy? They ain't pointy! - Shush! Shush! - Well, they ain't! Now I aim to see you dead and buried when this day's done. I didn't know you cared so much. Most people would say I ain't worth burying! Truth be told, I just need your head to collect the bounty. I'll be real quick with it. That's mighty big words from a man hiding behind whores. How'd you know they were whores? 'Cause there ain't no self-respecting woman that'd be out here running around alone. - Someone ran 'em off from somewhere! - Decent? I'll show him decent! Nora, enough. All right. Enough. All right, well, why don't you go round up the horses? Watch your ass. Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Think you can cover me? - Yep. There you go, there you go! Come on guys, let's go. You all right? I'll be a damn sight better when that asshole's shaking hands with the devil. I told you it wasn't gonna be no fun and games. It's kill or be killed out here. No! No! Oh, my God, no! Promise me you won't let that son of a bitch get away. I promise. I won't. I swear we'll get him. I'm not talking about Grimes. I told you this was a bad idea. I'm so sorry, Nora. I'm so sorry. At least I get to go out with a bang, huh? No! No! No! No! No! Please, no! No! She's-- Nora, no! Oh, God! No! Could you give us a minute... alone, please? Lord, I... Nora had a good soul. Despite what others may have said about her... she was a true friend, of which I never had many. And she-- she may have lived a wicked way, but she-- She was trying to change for her sake. And for yours, and... I-- I just hope that you will take that into consideration before you pass judgment on her, and me, for what I'm about to do in her name. Hey, come on. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hang on. Sorry about Nora. You know, me and you, we ain't that different. Come again? Killing for a living's a sin. Same as selling your body, maybe even more so. Yeah, maybe you're right. Guess we're all sinners. - So says the good book, right? - Yeah. I guess there's something about forgiveness in there too, though, right? Reckon so. Planning on forgiving Grimes for killing Nora? Hell, no. That son of a bitch is gonna get what's coming to him. You know what, why don't you hop down and fix Jolene's pack there? I'll take a look around. Son of a bitch. All right, let's move. You see something? I see Grimes. Come on. - Damn it! - I didn't have time to finish hitching. I can curse myself, can't I? I only have one good arm. Did the best I could. Why didn't you fetch me? I would've helped you. You know what, Alice? I just kind of figured that you had a lot on your mind, you know? Nora dying and all that, just didn't wanna bother you. Well, I do appreciate the sentiment, but now, what are we gonna eat tonight besides nothing? Oh, dear! Hey. You got a plan? Well... Well? I'm formulating one. Yeah. Okay. Hey, I promise. We'll make it through this. Yeah? Yeah, I know. You'd be the first man to keep his promise to a whore. I'd never be caught dead kissing a whore. All right? Now, that you are an honest woman, I'd be happy to spend the rest of my life kissing you. Ready? Gallup, you still kickin'? Where'd you learn how to bounce bullets? Spent some time in a Wild West show. Sharpshooters there taught me a trick or two. Worked out well when I was robbing their box office! Maybe it's time to give up outlawing and join the circus. Yeah, you'll make one hell of a bearded lady. Die, you limp-legged bastard! Jeez! Are you-- Was part of your plan pissing him off? Figured it couldn't hurt, seeing as we're up shit's creek. Give me your empty gun. All right, you ready to end this turkey shoot? Sure am. I like my tail feathers where they're at. Grimes. You got your trading pants on? Why? Are you out of cartridges? Yeah, that's why I'm firing insults and not lead. Well... what are your terms? My... My life for my pack mule. Nope. Too thin. The pack mule and a horse, that's a deal more to my liking. I'd be happy to oblige, but the gal I was with, she rode off on him. And left me in a lurch when you... when you shot her best friend. So you trust me to give you a fair shake? Ain't got much choice now, do I? All right, Gallup. Throw out your weapon, trot out the mule, and I'll let you live. For about one damn minute. All right. Yeah. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. I'm coming on down. Feel free to hobble out at your leisure. Yeah, I'll admit, as far as plans go, that was a mighty clever one. Yeah, it just kind of popped in my head as soon as he started talking about the Wild West. You know, trick riding. Now, listen. Any... Any woman who will risk her life for me... that's one hell of a gal in my book. Well, coming from a crippled up old bounty hunter, I'll take that as a compliment. People try to kill me damn near every day. It could mean that I need a career change. Well... you can do a lot of thinking on 2,000 dollars. You can bet on that. Well, I'm gonna go get the-- the critters. Eldon! No! No! No! Die! Die! What'd I ever do to you? No! No! Get out of the way. Alice. What's going on? Sheriff, I'm here for my bounty.
