He up ahead Let's split up Sorry... -Mr. Yuen -Yes I have a message for you Thank you "See you at the Columnade, Yong" Let me introduce you to Mr. Philip Ashley He's from the CIA He's got something very urgent to tell you Recognize him? He's known as "The Fixer" He fixes all kinds of things... Like firearms, drugs, kidnaps But his friends call him Mr. Zen Like he's some kind of philosopher Now I'm damn sure he's after you Me? Why me? Look 6 months ago, an American biochemist came up... with an even more dangerous version of Anthrax Called the Anthrax II Half a teaspoon of this can wipe out an entire village Interested buyers wanted results Turkey was chosen as a testing ground Hundreds of Turks died within a couple of weeks in the initial trial 2 months ago 4 scientists were killed in a village near Istanbul One we know worked on Anthrax II The locals killed him for revenge and to seize the toxin They realized how valuable it was What has this to do with me? Well, the day before this scientist was gunned down Agents spotted him meeting with Mr. Park Looks like your father was the middleman And the toxin was passed on to him But we don't think he made the delivery Day after the shooting Your father entered the South Korean Consulate in Istanbul Seeking asylum He gave the toxin to South Korea? No, no one knows where he hid it Now, can you remember what Mr. Park told you before he died? Nothing about this That's not what people think And that's why Mr. Zen sent her to approach you Sorry I'm late I knew you would be Your head? I fell My boss Mr. Zen invites you to dinner tonight Finally What? Didn't he send people after me? No, why would he? What does he want? He has the wrong man I don't have what he wants You must be his gift to me A generous host He's in big business You should talk to him Is that a warning? I've said all I should say I'm just a messenger What do you want? Don't move! You know why she's crying? She cries because all her sons were killed by you and your friends! You murderer! What? Just give me the thing! What thing? Give me the thing! I don't know what you're talking about The thing that killed all our people! Tell me, or you'll die painfully like our people did! What thing? Go get help Yong! Are you all right? What's going on? I don't know You murderer! Go! When I say go, run to the sea Go! Can you swim? There's a boat! Too late! Jump! I have never... seen so much death Did he get you addicted? I'm an orphan He's my master He provides for me He says, pretty girls... should enjoy pretty things If not for him Perhaps I would have died... in the orphanage at age 13 He saved... my life - Yong, you all right? - Boss Don't worry I brought your medication Yong! I went to rescue you Why didn't you wait? You didn't have to kill them If not for me the villagers would have killed you It's going to rain Come aboard Yes, I understand Goodbye Where were we? That's between you and my father I paid a deposit Part of the money in that... safety deposit box is mine I'll give it all to you Just leave me alone A deal is a deal I paid, and I want my goods Besides It's for your own good Really? Perhaps someone will pay you more But can they protect you? Will the Turks spare you? Your father killed their families They're after you; nothing I can do Unless you're my partner Then it's different Boss, your medication Wait, Yong I have a counter-offer In addition to the deposit I'll pay you 25% of my income About US$3.5 million Just give me Anthrax II I don't have it Take... Youg too Don't decide now Think it through The car is waiting But don't take too long My French buyer is impatient And don't keep Yong waiting She may die hanging around me I'm an orphan He saved... my life "Wait for me" He must have realized that he was going to die So he came to say a final goodbye to her How about a game of hide-and-seek with me? "Istanbul Bank" What can I do for you? Japanese? Not Japanese. I'm Chinese How are you? You speak Chinese? I worked in the Far East I know Chinese, Japanese and Korean You know this man? He came often We don't know his name I saw him 2 months ago He looked unwell I let him stay here 2 days later, he disappeared He called me afterwards And told me he was dying His son would come for his things "Game Over" A question If someone awaits your rescue But saving her... means others may die Would you still do it? If you don't go she will die Correct? I can only say Even if he was Hitler you should go The aftermath Leave that to God This may be the thing Maybe Go, take care We're leaving in 20 minutes This was... the terminal station of... the Orient Express It had its prime Zen told you all this? Only an empty shell remains as a tourist trap All things have their destiny Perhaps some day This will be grand again You're an optimist I have to be to survive You're free to go anywhere France, Italy, Switzerland Home? I must use the restroom Dear orphanage teachers I'm doing well I'm preparing for university exams The professors gave me a scholarship We'll use the money to repair... the orphanage I miss you all I'll study hard, Yong The last train to Paris will depart in 5 minutes Help, someone! Call the police! She was lying on the floor Get an ambulance! Yong Wake up! Halt! I'm sorry about your friend Americans can be very useful Shall we go get the stuff? Don't tell me you gave it to Zen So, I guess that's a "yes" If you had given it to us, that poor girl might still be alive This is how they control their organization They trust only the dead! One small dose was all it took to get her killed I shouldn't have come here, damnit! I should have let you rot in that Turkish jail Where's the car? This way, I'll take you back to the hotel No I've got to find Zen To do what? To get revenge? Can't you see that you're lucky to be still alive? Don't play innocent! There's blood on your hands You guys set the trap, Zen planted the bait I feel sorry for you and myself Hello I'm sorry, I lied to you about being a reporter But if you want to nail Zen Be at the Hazari Airport tomorrow at 2 pm And you better be prepared He is bringing his elite bodyguards What's Ashley's plan? He is flying to Athens to meet his boss The CIA wants the damage controlled And doesn't want any more black-bag operations in Turkey So we decided to take everything into our own hands. And buy back the Anthrax II from Zen We'll use the money to repair... the orphanage I miss you all I'll study hard, Yong P.S. I'm going somewhere far away No address yet If you need anything Contact my friend Buck Yuen What's he doing here? Let's go! What the hell is he doing here? Good question! Hurry up! Hurry up! Boss!
