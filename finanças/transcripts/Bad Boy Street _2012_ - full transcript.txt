That's what every French person says. But it's true, no? No. Bonne morning. Good morning. Do you want to have a shower? Well, I guess I could use one. Yes, me too. [Shower running] So, where did you do these bruises? Oh, it's from a movie. I did a fight scene. You should be careful with your home movies, Mister James Bond. Where am I, by the way? Paris. Yeah, I know that. But where? Umm, Monmartre. Uhh, Pigalle. Do you know Pigalle? No. Sacre-Coeur? Moulin Rouge? Moulin Rouge? Oh, Moulin Rouge. Yeah. That's something I know. You've heard about Moulin Rouge? Yeah. I saw the movie. It's a place first. It was a place, before being a movie. It's right here. You can see it from the balcony. Really? I think you're clean. Okay. I like water. I like air, too. You like what? Air, air. I like elements. Water, air, wood. Oh, where are my clothes? What clothes? I do hope I had some on last night. I'm joking. I washed them. They're drying. They should be dry. Here. All nice and clean. And here is everything that was in the pockets. Oh, just like in prison. Excuse me? Well, I haven't actually been in a real prison. Just, you know, in the movies. Don't worry, I didn't take anything. I just looked through it to see if you had an address, or name. Yeah, well, I don't carry anything important around with me. I'm losing everything! Wait - you don't know who I am? No. You didn't tell me your name. You were very drunk last night. You had no identification on you, and I didn't know where you were staying, so I brought you here. Yeah, I was completely wasted. Wasted? Very drunk. So, what's your name? Mine is Claude. My name? Brad. My name is Brad. Are you sure? Yeah. Nice to meet you, Claude. Nice to meet... What? This is how we do it in France, right? Yes, of course. What's this weird accent? Funny. My accent? You find my accent funny? Yeah, where does it come from? Arizona, I guess. Yeah. Let's say Arizona. Are you in a hurry? Well - no, actually. Great! How about some breakfast? Sounds great. I think I have some eggs, and maybe some sausages, too. Sounds good. Do you have croissants? No croissants. Coffee? Yes, please. Do you have a cigarette? No, I don't smoke. What? You don't smoke, have sausage and eggs for breakfast instead of croissants? What's next, are you going to tell me you don't drink wine? No, I don't drink much wine. Are you sure you're French? Yeah, of course. Joking. And you are American, so what are you doing here? Having sex, and smoking, and drinking? Shouldn't you be shooting a gun somewhere, and going to church? Wow, you do know American well. Yeah, I lived there for one year. Oh yeah? When? It was a long time ago. I was your age. I was in Texas. San Antonio. Why? I had a love there. The one true love of my life. So I moved there to live with him. I think that's when I started having streak and eggs for breakfast. So what happened? It just ended. I moved back to Paris. I've never gone to America since then. That's too bad. It's okay. Like I said, it was a long time ago. It's romantic, though. Running away to be with your true love. It's impractical, though. I suppose. I've never been in love. Never? No. Not yet, at least. So what brings you to Paris? I am... I'm here with my friends. We came on a college trip. I'm here for another week. So it's your first time in Paris? Yeah. I was here as a kid, but that doesn't really count. What do you think of Paris? So far? I love it. [Knock on door] Who is that? I don't know. It's my friend. No, no, no! What are you doing? Don't answer it! I have to, it's my friend. Don't worry, I'll get rid of her. Goodbye, Mister America! She's gone. I should get going. It's okay, she won't be back. She's harmless. A little crazy, but harmless. No, it's not her. It's just that... I have to meet my friends. I don't want to be late and have them worry. Finish your breakfast, at least. Thank you. Thank you for breakfast, and... And everything. I really should run. Bye. Are you doing anything later? No, I don't have plans. Great! So... How about dinner? I could be here by 9ish. Yes, that could be nice. - Yeah? - Yes. Great. Okay. Umm, what about my hat? Do you have it? Thanks! What about my sunglasses? Yeah - I'm very sensitive to the sun. See you tonight? Alright.

Yes, a little. Great. My name is Michael. I'm Aaron... Um, Brad's manager. I hate to meet you under these circumstances, but... I'm gay myself, so I understand what you're going through. The thing is, um, Aaron - or Brad... Signed a contract which had a morals clause. And it's a very big film, a very big part of a franchise, so, with this morals clause, if anything were to get out in the press about him being... Um, not to the studio's liking, and let's just say they're a very conservative studio, it could really hurt Brad. He would be fired. He could be sued, even. Because of something like this. So, I have some form for you. It's a confidentiality agreement, there's that, there's a prepared statement we've written for you, which basically states that nothing happened between the two of you. It would be really great if you could sign these for me. Um, I have a pen here... If you could just sign here, and... here. Here as well. And... here. That would be so... we'd really appreciate it, so much. And Aaron really appreciates this, as well. I mean, Brad. [Cell phone ringing] I'm sorry, I have to get this call. I hope you don't mind. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there in five minutes. No, it's not a problem. Okay, yeah. Okay, see you in five minutes. This weather here is just terrible for my allergies! Oh. Oh, make sure to sign this one, too. Yes, thank you. And Brad thanks you, too. So, um... great. And we have your contact information, so... Here's my card. Feel free to call me anytime. I'll be sure to have tickets for you, for the premiere here in Paris. And if you're ever in LA, give me a call. I'm behind the scenes, so I have no morals clause. Okay. Thank you. Thank you again.
