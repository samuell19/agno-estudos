Being an honest girl is a pretty difficult thing,... .. but be poor and honest nowadays... .. is one of the hardest things that can happen. Donatella Guiscardi:... .. she was a saleswoman in a porcelain warehouse and is now out of work. She takes lessons of stenography in order to earn more... .. and improve a little her condition. She must return home by foot, to save the tram money. And the way is long, full with temptations, desires, and dreams. - Hi. - What happened to you? It's half an hour I'm waiting for you. I stopped to look at the shop windows. It's better not to look at them. So many temptations less. What did you buy? Nothing, they are books, it's daddy stuff. Did you find something? Maybe. I have to introduce me to a veterinarian at 16 o'clock. One takes nursing degree and then ends up treating monkeys and dogs. It's better than nothing. Then what am I supposed to say? I got stiff. Sooner or later I leave all: house, family and work and I go away. - And where are you going? - There is one who woos me. But who is he, that one... No, this is nicer. This one has the (Fiat)1100. Have you seen what shop they opened? And think that I must take the tram four times a day! With the 'assortment" of pushing, elbows,... And pinches of the gentlemen with their distracted face. - It seems that is our destiny. - Nice destiny! Do you think it's right that we must travel in these conditions and those ones in those gorgeous cars? - But those have the money! - And why don't I have them? - Because you do not earn them. - Ah, thank you! But if one gets so much money to buy one of those machines... ..and I don't even can travel by bus, something must be wrong. By the way, I must hurry to the vet, if I don't, maybe somebody take my place. - See you later. - Ciao. - Where is Guido? - He went to the bar. Good morning. - Give me two liters of mix. Please, come here. Hello! I was taking a coffee. - What 's the problem? - Listen to me, Guido! If you want to keep on staying with me, you must like only me, do you understand? And no one else, not even Marilyn Monroe, did you? Intesi. But where are you going? I like you more than Marilyn Monroe, you know, don't you? The truth is that my girlfriend is you, not Marilyn Monroe. So what are you doing with all these photos of Abbe Lane? What? Don't pretend, you've understood very well. Abbe Lane? But I don't... Who is Abbe Lane? I don't even know who he is. Ah, yes? And what is this photo you've cut out from the newspaper?! "Abbe La..." Ah! But I didn't cut the newspaper because of her! Well, eh? No, I was interested... by this... this news here. I cut off the page and by accident it was behind it. - Let's see what is the news that interested you so much. - Look. THE BEST REMEDY FOR THE CONVULSIVE COUGH THE WONDER SYRUP Was this what you were looking for? Then you have convulsive cough. Yes, especially the night. By day almost never. And I feel nasty, you know? Because... I can't breathe anymore. Poor love, you have to care for yourself. I got a lot of stuff, and nothing. Now let's try that syrup. You will be fine. Now that you've told me, I'll take care of it. Thank you. - It's one o clock, I go home. - Goodbye, darling. - Oh! But are you crazy ?! - What's happened to you? You have the convulsive cough attacks, and I don't want to catch them. Bye. - That's how I trust you, huh? - Why? What did I do? Why did you let her dig through in there? How did I know that you have pictures of women? What? Women? - Hi. - Hi, Nicola. An hour and a quarter. You have the watch ahead, is two minutes to one. What's that got to do with it? I said, an hour and a quarter locked. On the boulevard. - Ah, yes? - At boulevard, you know, there... - San Carlo Boulevard? No, on that little market they call "Largo Goldoni". I understand, that little market... Blocked between a tangle of trolleybus, Vespa, taxi... And in the middle of this, guess the policeman to whom gives the fine? - You. - Eh! How did you guess? You are the one who receive five or six fines a day. Is my fault? It is the fault of modern mechanical means. What modern mechanical means? You don't have a taxi! You have a wreck that reminds of the time of the horse-drawn tram. But in summer does well, huh? In the winter, you know, just a little wind.. .. and the engine immediately suffers and it stops. But where does it stop, I wonder? In front of traffic lights and stop bans. Listen, passing from a traffic light to the other... Who won? Ah, then... We lost the first game . - I knew that. And the second one? - I won it. - Yes... You have to explain to me this enigma: how come when we play together we lose... .. and when you are playing alone you win? What ennigma?... Is my fault? You don't want to agree with me. You did not want to bet on Dormiglione (Sleeper), but on Lampo(Lightning). You want to judge the horses according to their names, and the names cheat. The truth is that Dormiglione has arrived and Lampo no. But how can you bet on a horse called Dormiglione? And yet one day he does not sleep and wins. Come here, give me the paper, it's mine! Boys, the shoes are expensive, huh? Daddy! Tell him that the newspaper is mine! - Not true, the newspaper is mine! - No, it's not his! It's neither him nor you, because the newspaper is mine! It's finished! And see if your sister comes. You, put it on. Hey! The bag! Donatella! Hurry up! Up, wash your hands. I might have a safe horse. Do you want to bet on him together with me ? What's his name? - The name doesn't matter. - If I don't like his name, I don't bet him. At table you can not read! She is right, you can't does read at table. Give it to me. Put it underneath. - Hi, dad. - Hello. Listen here, how come you've come ...a little late, today? - I went from the books guy. - Oh yes? He said he was telling them the Moroccan(?) You must not eat the bread before the soup! Give me the plate. So, the Moroccan... Not yours, his! He is the one who receives a lot of fines. And the shoes from Romuletto? You forgot them. The shoes are old now, he can no longer accommodate. Do not worry, I told you to take the shoes of Romoletto... You gine me the plate o no??! And you take them from Romoletto, right? They are shoes that one can't find them anymore, are made before the war... - I'm fine, I walk well. Dad... - Eh? - If one found a purse... - A purse? - What should he do? - Did you find a bag? - I said so, for curiosity. - Donatella, don't scare us. - Then? Are you talking about curiosity or really? You think about finding the bag then... - At the rest we think about it. - What have you got to do with it, excuse me? Why? Am I not part of the family? You forget that for your children I am milk uncle. For a drop of milk we took from the same nanny,... .. this one has become my father, my brother, my mother... In short, Dad, if I found it, what should I do? My daughter, remember when your poor mom lost the wedding ring made of gold... .. and no one ever got alive? Well, from that day I thought:... .. "If I find an old sock, maybe with holes,..." ".. I make a night cap, but I shall not return it to anyone." And then, your family needs of shoes, clothes, medicines... Your father can not do it anymore, your brothers are hungry... and the house lives in the utmost indigence! How come, have we become a family of miserable people ?! We don't have the fur coats, we are not going by car,... .. we will not have the TV, but we live as honest people. Not quite so, dad, if we think we want to keep the stuff of others. It's only two hours that we made the complaint! But tonight I have to leave! I do not care about the bag, are the documents that interest me! Do you understand that I risk $ 350,000? In my opinion, a practical thing is to put an advertisement on the newspaper. Do not talk so calmly, you make me more nervous! Come on, try to do something! Talk to the lawyer! And this message when it arrives ?! Dear, we called New York, not Frascati... Pasquale, what are you doing here? I hate to listen at the doors, I've told you hundreds of times! I did not listen, ma'am. Down there is a girl who wants to talk with you. I am not here. I think it's in his interest to listen to that girl. Why? Because I think she has found your bag. My bag ?! And you say it so? Where? Where is this girl? Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. I'm so glad to meet you! Is this it? - I think so. Oh yes! It's exactly my bag! I wanted to bring it earlier, but then I couldn't. Here are the letters, the documents, everything! Giorgio! Giorgio! Is not bad for a thanks. - If it is for the reward, you can wait. What reward? You are entitled to 10% of the value of the object found. - The lady can not ignore it. - Really? What a luck! And me, I was so desperate! Did you see? Even these Italians are honest people. Thank you, Miss. You don't know what a weight has been taken from me . From you? I would have been in trouble if I hadn't found the bag. I'm sorry, I had to open it to see the address. Certainly, yes... Did you hear? She also apologizes. Is not her adorable? - Where did you find it? - Near the Arch of Giano. See? What did I tell you? You were perfectly right, the blame is all mine. - But now it's better to warn the police. Scuse me. Remember to cancel the ads and to reassure the lawyer in New York! Couldn't you do it, darling? meanwhile I think about the rest. And how can I do it? I have to deal with that girl. If you are busy, I can occupied myself to reward the Miss. Reward? Yes, of course, she deserves it, poor one. I didn't think at all . Oh? And why should you do it? It's something that regards me. You mingle too much in things that do not concern you, Pasquale - I've already told you other times, remember it. - I apologize. I finally came to you! Please stay there, don't hesitate, please! Thank you. - What a beautiful house, lady! - You like it? I would never have thought that there might be an equal one. - Is there everything? - Yes, yes, of course. What is your name? - Donatella. Donatella! It's really a nice name. It made me a great pleasure, not for the bag, but for the papers contained. I would like to return, at least in small part. Is there anything that you particularly want? Many things, ma'am, I would not know where to start from. Up, let's see together. Maybe your family is not in good shape? - Not quite. - I imagined. You ought to be very poor or very rich to be so honest. Do you work? No, it's so hard to find a place. I'm finishing a typing course. - So a good job would please you. It would be nice! - Sure. A job, among friends I have, should not be difficult to find. As secretary, as a trusted person... But yes, what a stupid I am ! It's done! Search a job? I can offer you myself. I really need you Tonight Giorgio and I will be in New York, at least six weeks... During this time, someone who supervises the progress,... .. the correspondence, phone calls, a trusted person, in short. But I'm not a trusted person, I have never tried. My dear, where could I find a more trusted person than you? And also, I live with my family, I can not stay out of the night. You can come in the morning and go in the evening as for any job. - But I think... - Any protest is useless. I wish you will have a good memory of this day, as I will have of you. Now I'll explain what's to do. Wait, huh? Pasquale? - Daddy! I found work! -Really?! Yes, a sort of secretary of an American lady. Did you hear it? An american lady ... - Do you know how much they will give you? - 80,000 a month! - 80, daddy! She earns more than you! - Eh, yes, you earn more than me! 80,000 lire a month... then, a day would come... Explain to me: do you send your daughter to work as secretary? Scuse me, eh! Would you like better if I would send her to work as bricklayer? Maybe I am provincial, but for me the woman must stay home. - If not, what's happening? Outgoing, working, earning! - 200... Become independent, authoritarian, loses femininity... .. so she is no longer a woman. - Yeah, she becomes a man... - Why, would it be the first time? Didn't you read in the newspapers? All these changes of sex... Because they work too much at night. No, it is the fault of modern civilization! One can't understand anything. - In fact... Do as you think, but if I were a father it would seem to me to use my daughter. - Daddy! - Thank you! - For me? - Cigarettes. - Oh, thank you, this is exactly what I wanted! - It's expensive. No, I don't take it. After the speech you did, it seem to you to use my daughter? - Am I perhaps the father? I am the milk uncle. - Yes... Now do not smoke them one after another. With these I go well until Sunday. - May I? What did you want? - Thank you. - Well, no, until Saturday. - And what is this? It's a medicine for coughing, don't touch it! - Do you feel bad? - It's not for me, Daddy. Do you want to know how I found work? I wanted to ask you... - Do you remember the bag I told you today? Did you really find it? Sure. I returned it to her mistress and she found me a job. If you saw what house... You seem to be in a movie! This is Guido! And now what are you doing? You go away? - Only one munute, Dad... - But soon it's the supper. I'll be down after, I'm only half an hour, and then tomorrow I'll start working... Okay, but do not move too far from the door. - Hello! Hello. Come back soon. You may tell what you want,... .. but if she was my daughter, I wouldn't let her go out at this hour. You forget that we come from that family:... .. to a cert'oraAt a certain hour, all were at home, even Uncle Angelino,... .. more than forty years old, a piece of man so, at 18:30 at home. - Do you remember, eh? - Here! That was special guarded. See, I'm trusting Donatella. She is like a little girl. I see her as a woman, but if you see her as a little girl... It's a little girl! She would play with the dolls! - Meanwhile he goes out with Guido. - So? - Guido also plays with dolls? Guido is the most serious young boy from Rome... .. and he is so shy that he would not be able to touch her with a finger. Stop moving these hands! After 11 months of engagement we are still at the point of the kiss! At what point would you like to be? Not so far, but at least a little like this. Until we are married you don't touch me even so! - Why, do I have leprosies? - Ah, by the way... What are you doing? What is that stuff? The medicine on the newspaper. Ah... after you give it to me and I 'll take it at home. - No, you take it now in front of me! - I'm not a child! If you do't cure yourself, you don't come near me anymore, do you understand? Swollen cough is contagious. Bevi. You needed to fill it, eh? Very good! You have to take it every evening for a month. Thank you. - You are welcome. The mistress leaved? Yes, last night, as she had already told you. Please have a seat. - Are there any orders for me? In fact you have to give me orders today. And what must I order? Anything you need, miss,... .. we are at his full disposal, as if you were the lady herself. In short, what kind of work is mine? No, Miss, she doesn't have to work at all. If they give me a salary, I'll have to earn it, right? Sure. In fact, you are the trusted person. What will do the trusted person...? It is usually a person that, with the excuse of doing the interests of others... .. it only does his own. - You will not believe that I... - No, you are an extraordinary case. Returning that handbag... .. proves that you don't defend very well your interests. - How would I like to play it. - No one stops you, Miss. The trouble is I can't. - Does the lady play? - Yes, sometimes, with a finger. But from a while she has stopped, classical music doesn't interest her anymore. So why she keeps the piano? Because it is a nice furniture and it gives a certain tone to the house. How many books! The madam is amusing her so much! I wouldn't know, she never reads them. They are there to decorate. And then, they impose respect and give importance to the environment. Who knows how bored she is, if is all day she doesn't do anything. If she'd get bored, she wouldn't be a real lady. The secret is this: have fun where others are bored and vice versa. - How difficult it is to do the lady... - Do not believe, you get used to it soon. Do you want to go around the villa? What would do a lady in this case? She would have already ordered me. Then I want to do it, because it's from this morning that I want to see it! Please. This is Elvira, Mrs. Dorothy's personal maid. - Good morning. - Good morning. How much stuff! What does her with all these bottles? The question was right for the books and the piano,... .. but ointments and perfumes are the only things that the lady makes good use of. - Isn't it, Elvira? - Oh yes. Among massages, ultraviolet rays, maquillage and various dresses,... .. the lady is dedicated to the care of his person about seven hours a day. The normal working hours, Miss. And what is this? My God! It seems to me to be at Rinascente (Supermarket)! And she puts them all? If you have to change two, three times a day, you understand... How cute is this! It looks like the one I saw in the window this morning. Why do not you try it? Mrs. has your size. But it's not mine. The lady never wears a dress more than twice,... .. and this she has already used enough. - Thanks, but I prefer not. - As you want. Now that you have seen everything, if you wish, give me the lunch orders. Yes... but I would not know. What do you recommend me? Pate grilled, roasted chicken with potato (french) Well, yes... I did not understand anything. Roasted chicken with potatoes. - How good is it! Did you cooked it? - Yes Miss. You like it? I really don't eat too often this stuff. But, eat so, with all three of you standing up... I can't do it. Does Miss want to be alone? - No. Why don't you sit down? - The service does not permit... Let it go and sit down! Thanks Miss. You are the most sympathetic mistress I've ever had. And the kindest. - Use your hands, Miss. You are right. - Listen Pasquale, are you Neapolitan? - Yes. Why do not you talk neapolitan? It would be more fun. I would feel better. When I am working, really I can't allow myself.. I'll permit you. - Thank you. It make me feel good. Me too. What does the lady do after lunch? - Calls her friends. - Mine all works. She goes shopping What an idea! Who gives me the money? - Plays canasta. - I do not know how to play. - Walking by car. - That would please me. It can be done? Of course! What do you prefer? The Mercedes? The Cadillac? I don't know. They are all so kind, so happy! Don't smile too much, if no a crowd will follow us. Why? Because you are a beautiful girl and I am forty-eight! Now what should I do? Do you want me to help you in the kitchen? I can polish the silverware. I know how to do that. Relax, miss, one of the troubles of the century is because of the ladies who want to work for "doing something". And so, they take the job to those who really need it. But I am boring to do nothing. Right now you are a lady, and the ladies take the tea in the afternoon . I don't like tea. Then you can prepare for the dinner, take a bath... The bath? That one with the foam and the scent, like in the movies? Like in the american movies. I'll ask the maid, huh? Good evening. Good evening, Pasquale. - Good evening. - Is the lady ready? - The lady left last night. Has left? But we had an appointment. She has gone suddenly. I have heard about inheritance. - Maybe you know better than me. - She could have warned me. We had to go to dinner together. But the proxy? Did she leave a proxy for me, for the board? -She didn't say anything to me, sir. She does the same everytime.. And then there is the issue of titles. Could she forgot? I do not know, sir. Do you want to look above in her desk? Yes, thank you, let's go together. Is it very important? Yes, it is for the administrative board. If Dorothy is not here, someone will have to represent her, right? The women should not be interested in business. Elvira, please, I... Oh, sorry. I'm really mortified, I did not know... I had an appointment with Dorothy tonight... Miss Donatella Guiscardi is the guest of the lady. Mr. Maurizio Dal Pra . Are you indeed? Yes, I am, or at least I believe I am. I'm so sorry. The truth is that Ms Dorothy intructed me to tell you that the appointment was anulled. Ah... I have forgotten, like a stupid one. Don't worry. Of course now the evening fell apart. Yes, I know, I ruined it. Come out with me, so we can mend the evening. Me? I don't miss the evening, you will bring me to the embassy and so all is settled. - What do you say? - Yes, I understand, but I can't. - Maybe you already have a commitment? - No, I really can't. I understand. Well, I don't want to impose you my company. This isn't so, is that... I really can't, can I, Paquale? Maybe Miss alludes to the dress? I think the tailoring has already bring it, hasn't it, Elvira? - It's just arrived right now. Don't worry,you'll be fine. Did you see? I'm going down waiting for you, huh? But are you crazy both of you? Go on, have fun... What's wrong in it? That's not why, is that I don't know him, and then in the evening... Do not worry, is a good guy. Yes, I know, but my dad waits me for dinner, he will be worried... - Can't you call him? Yeah, I could phone him down at the bar. Maybe mister needs a Martini? Hey, there's Maurizio with one! - But that one is not... - Abbe Lane, yes. What did you say? Abbe Lane. Never heard his name? Nothing wrong, though. - Shee also has a certain class. Who knows where he caught her. At Cottolengo he caught her... She seems half stupid. All envy. Since Maurizio leaved you, you don't agree anyone. He leaved me? I leaved him, if you want to know! What do you take? - I do not know... You order. - Two Martini. A photo, gentlemen? Please... I would love to know her. I do not think it's difficult. But why does it matter so much to you? I would like to know why the men likes her so much. - Well, it's not very difficult to figure it out. - Do you like her? Of course. You can't be interested in a woman like this. - But it's not my type. - What is your type? It is a cute girl, but not beautiful,... .. I mean, that beauty too vivid, aggressive. It's cool, cheerful, full of vivacity, and at the same time sweet, tender... When you see her, she looks fragile, instead it is strong,... .. and when she gets angry she becomes a fury. - And then, she is in love. - What's her name? I do not know! - Giancarlo! - Hello, Maurizio. How are you? - I think you know Abbe Lane. - Yes. - Can you present him to her? - With pleasure. Sorry, Giancarlo Sterzi, Maria Laura Castello, Donatella Guiscardi. - With great pleasure, Miss. Let's go right now! - Really I... Make her company. Let's go. Where did you have the little girl? In college? Do not say nonsense. I met her tonight. Ah, "coup de foudre" then. If I had known that you like the schoolgirls I would have learned the part. You would miss the spontaneity. Miss is your great admirer. Thank you. I am tired of the male admirers. Could you leave to me at least the female admirers? - Are not you jealous? - Yes a lot. If it was only one, I would have killed him, but there are so many. Every day is the same thing. It's a beautiful dress.Who is your tailor? I do not know, change often... Can I look at these letters? - Sure. Would you mind bringing me from who did your dress? I like it very much. Come to dinner with me, so you will talk comfortably. Impossible, my dog must go to bed and is afraid to be alone. Mediterranean air makes him bad. Do you know a good vet? Here eats a lot of pasta and always sleeps. There is Professor Valli who is very brave, you can ask him. Do you know the address? No, but will find it on the phone book. I AM A HUMBLE FAN OF YOU, I WORK AT THE GAS STATION... IF YOU SHOULD PASS BY HERE AND YOU NEED GAS, DON'T FORGET ME There are crazy, why waste the money for the stamp? - Yeah. - We decided to go to dinner. - I'm sorry, I can not. I speak with Maurizio. He does everything what I say. Goodbye! "Adios"! Ah, here he is. I decided to dine together us, Massimo, Francesco... - No, thank you, we can not. - Because? Come on. Another time. Thank you for everything, we'll see you tomorrow. Hi, Maria Laura. Excuse me, but spend the evening with kickers... I did not feel it. - Maybe you prefered to stay, right? - No, indeed. So where do we want to go? At Victor, at Jicky? - And if we go out of Rome? - I really do not know anything. Ah, already, I forgot that you are a guest of Dorothy. Have you ever been to Rome? Of course? I was born here. Really? You had been missing for a long time. Are you on holiday? On holiday... In a few days everything will be over. Are you sorry? This music is so good! It makes me dance! - Why do not we try? - Here? - Yeah. What's wrong? We are here, there is space, the music also... - And if someone passes? Who may pass? Come. My God, it's already midnight, I have to run home! - Why? It's still so early... - Please, take me home. Yeah, we were out for dinner and instead we jumped it. Do you know that I didn't notice it? Me too. It was the most beautiful of my life. Thank you. It was an evening like the other. Yes, but even them sometimes can be extraordinary. Donatella! When will we see each other again? I do not know. And tonight the little girl stopped with the Befana... Stop these speeches, I'm already so worried... I know, I understand you, your father's craft is full of responsibility. This is why a girl at that age must be supervised,... .. you have to make her understand the dangers she could meet! In short, you have to explain to her about men. Yes, but it is not so easy... There was her mother... Among these women these speeches can be made, but me, as a father, as a man... - How do I do it? You have to find the modality, bring comparisons... There is the tale of the wolf and the lamb, you tell her and then tell her... .. "If you have no opinion, do the end of the lamb." How is this fairy tale? Ah... Hello, Daddy. Good evening, Uncle. Still awaken at this time? Well, we were waiting for you. I called you to warn you, right? I was told you would have been late but I would not have imagined at this time. Eh? You know, so many bad things can happen... What do you think it could happen? Feel a little bit, do you know the witch and lamb fable? Daddy, do you think it's time to tell stories? Yes, this is indeed, the most likely moment. Oh well... the fairy tale of the lamb that went to the brook... Was it going to the brook? - Well... It isn't known if it was going to the brook. Anyway, the wolf ate the lamb by day, not by night. - He ate him by day? - Oh yes? - Sure. What do you mean? By day or by night it doesn't matter. But he ate it, this is what counts. What your dad wanted to say is this:... .. The lamb, the symbol of candor and purity, goes to the brook to drink. The wolf also goes to the brook, but not to drink. When the lamb... the wolf sees... you understand that... "Ham"! - Explain to her, you do it better - Yes, I'll explain to her. See, Donatella, this is a fairy tale for great people, in short... That is, that... men are like wolves, here it is. Not all of them, Daddy. For example, the one I met tonight was so cute. I know, men try us, but then they do what we want. Dad, I know them well. They don't do "Ham" to me. - Goodnight! - Good night. Eh... See how are the daughters today? You want to make a speech and they know more than you. And then? What you do? Ah, what times... Times of wolves... Oddio... I think with a nice pair of half-soles... Half? Heavy socks up here, under the heel, and a pair of heels... An upper, an invisible chunk... In short, they are still okay. - How not! The laces are almost new! The laces are almost new... You must't be witty, they still can be taken (wear) ! To the garbage. How gentlemen you are... Do you like it? Eh? - Eh... - No, no... Do you like it? Eat, eat... I was tasting this stuff, but I still do not understand what it is. For a sweet thing is a little bitter... - Yes, eh? My opinion is...Well? I tell you right away. Here, is a little scaffolding, lacks the salt. What do you mean? - That's the glue to bind the books, stupid! Ah, glue... ?! - Scuse me, but you have put the glue in the casserole? The little has broken . Then make a nice label with a skull, two tibias with the words... "Whoever touches the little pan dies." Hello, Daddy, I'm going! Brings these shoes from the shoemaker, if you please.. How can I walk around with these shoes? Who sees you? They're wrapped up with the newspaper, take them... Besides I go to the villa on another way. I would find five minutes to go there! You have the car... Who can see you, if you take them in the car? - And then, wrap it with the newspaper... - Hey! This one costs 50 lire every meter. - Please go! - All right. - And tell him to repair them soon. I take you so. Hi Dad. See you, Uncle Nicola. Sewed, huh? No nails! - All right. Rubber heel and on it American heel! Hey, and with what I glue the books, if you eat it all? No... because deep down it is not bad. - It's flour, right? - Yes, it is flour... It 's a bit harsh, tie up a bit... Maybe because I put a lot of alum. - Alum? - Oh yeah. That's why... I felt something that annoyed me. Hey, you! I called you! Eh? Ah, here I am. - Dieci? - No, no. - Five? - No, no, two liters are enough. Yes, it is enough to arrive at the next distributor... And you, move, clean the glasses to the mister! Come on, walk! Hey! But are you crazy? I'm gonna pass your cough with the kicks of my boots ! What cough ?! That one with the red hair that you like so much! Stop it with this Abbe Lane... You're fixed! But who thinks of it? It is pronounced "Abi Lein", ignorant! So don't you like it? And who sent her your picture with the pipe in the mouth ?! You want to be cute... You want be Clark Gable. What a stupid thing to say! And then, who did I tell you? You do not think about it! Think about your job! But what is it ?! Two liters, I told you! - As soon as you talk to Abbe Lane, you no longer know anything! - But no... What the hell did you do! What do you want? - I want two liters. Two liters... There are 18, 2304 lire. You joke! I asked you two! You asked for two, but now there are 18 in the car! - I didn't asked so! - But the car is yours! Come on, get them out! Have you seen what happens to the spy ?! He considered me a real lady, he didn't doubt anything! It means that Miss has style,... .. you see it by the way she wears the lady's clothes. It's a bit funny, but it's so comfortable... But I'm sorry to deceive him so, at some point I was going to tell him everything. - And it would ruin the evening, Miss. - Yes, you are right. In the end, what that matters to him? I will not see him again. I think it's impossible, because putting in order the documents from the lady's desk... .. I found the prosecution that Mr. Maurizio was looking for. In fact, I have to warn him to come and pick her up. If you allow me, I'll make a phone call. Pasquale, wait a moment... If Maurizio asks for me... Oh God, he probably he won't do it, but if he will do it,... .. tell him I can not, that I'm busy. - And if he comes here, Miss? - And if he comes here... - Tell him I'm out to do a commissiofor my father . - Good. So I'm... inappropriate... .. continue on this basis our negotiations. Miss, you may go. - Do I have to add greetings? - Natural, add greetings. Giancarlo, you know I'm tired of changing secretary every 5 minutes? Why, do you want to send away this too that one that is so great? Try not to disturb her. The office is full people who do not do anything. You are enough. - Yes? Ah, Pasquale! - Mr. Maurizio, good morning. Bravo! Ready, I'm coming to retire it. Is Miss Donatella at home? No, Miss is busy, sir. You can not come now, she must go out for a commission. Okay. See you, Pasquale. Giancarlo, I'm leaving, has been found Dorothy's delegation. There is no hurry, you need it for Friday, send somebody. No, it have been lost once, is too important. - Leave everything on my shoulders? - You're my partner. Do not take bad habits. I agreed to be your partner because you are a great worker. - Hello. Yes, tell me. - Miss, do you want to come to me? - Good. Hi! I thought I will not find you. Actually I was leaving. Goodbye. No, wait! Since we already met, I will accompany you. I also wanted to show you the photo they took yesterday. Thank you, but I have to go. And then she must see those cards, on by Pasquale. There is no hurry. Where do you want to go? Tailoring? Hair dresser? I wanted to take a walk, I can manage. Maybe I'm disturb you. Do you have an appointment? Do you have to see someone? - No, I do not have to see anyone. - Then we'll go! Courage! - Really... - Where should you bring that parcel? It's Mrs. Dorothy's stuff, I have to take it... Maybe it is far away, you can not, I... Listen, Donatella, do you want an advice? - Tell me - You must overcome your shyness. I say that in your interest, not for me, I really appreciate it. Finding a girl like her now, in our environement... .. is a rather rare thing. - I annoy you, maybe? - No, but change the subject. Well. Then tell me something about you, about your parents, about your home. - It's here. - Where? - There. But how, so close? You said it was far away. Yes, by foot, by car you arrive soon. Then goodbye and thank you. No, I wait for you, anyhow I have nothing to do. But... really... it's a long time that I do not see these of my friends. - Maybe I stop for lunch. I will wait a while, if I do not see you I'll go. - As you like. - Agree? - Thank you. - Goodbye. Good morning. For the children of the inmates? God will repay you. The truth is.... Tell me. Maybe do you want a receipt? No, no, not at all. - So thank you. And Jesus Christ be praised. Always be praised. But... we are not going to the villa... Yes, but I take a longer road.You dislike it? No, in fact. Only... I can not go with people like you. Why? What's wrong? Do you know that you make me very curious? - lo? And why? - Mah, I do not know. You are so different from the other I know... There is something in your behaviour that I do not understand. You are so reserved, closed, I would say. Why? It's since last night that... I think only at that. Do you believe me? I do not know. Men are never sincere when they talk to a woman. Yes, maybe it is true, but at certain times and with certain women... I am. I wish they were always sincere. Why are you so severe? Do you never tell lies? Attention! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Look here a little. EhilÃ ! I really did not know that the bribes were from the vet. What are you doing here? I accompanied Abbe and her dog to the vet. Like you, by the way. I hope they don't think that we take a percentage. - Good morning. - How did it go? - Good. - Nothing serious, I hope. - Italian cuisine is not good for him. - Oh, what a luck! Remember your promise? What promise? - To accompany me to your dressmaker. - Ah, yes... but now? - Yes! - I'm going to the vet. - Look! I want ten of that! - All equal? - No, silly, ten of this kind, but different. From afternoon, from evening... Then, "vamos"? Well, a moment, I have to wait for Maurizio. "Estos hombres" I'm a bitch! What is his name? We do not know, we've hurt him now with the car and... No, her dressmaker! What's your name? Ah, the dressmaker... I was thinking of the dog. Well, it's a bit hard, you know... all these names... Let's look inside, there should be the label. - Yes, but I should take it off, though. - It's a good idea. If you leave him here it is better, we can cure him. - Our staff is specialized. - I will occupy of him personally. Well. I leave you my telephone number. Call me just after the dog is cured. Sure. - Then we agree. - All right. - Thank you. Maurizio, "nos vamos" at Donatella's dressmaker. - You follow us with your car. - And who is in the office ? Ah, it's true. Well, I think between the two of us it's better that you go. Treat me as an old customer, as Donatella. - True, Donatella? - Of course, please Are you our customer? - You don't recognize your model? - Yes, but the lady does not... Show me the models as worn by "seÃ±orita". I will try not to disappoint her. Please sit down, please. In the meantime, I'm going to take Maria Laura. Goodbye. "Hasta luego." Excuse me my curiosity, but Mrs. Winston... She had a model like this, in fact it is exactly this one. But relax, I did not steal it. I had no intention... I was just surprised. It suits you very well. For Mrs. Winston it was too young, but it is very fit for you. If only all of my customers wear the dresses like you! Which one do you prefere? I don't know..The red one! Yes, red, green, blue, yellow, gray, black... - I want to make you a small gift. - A gift? And why? To show my gratitude. What is your address? - Via San Teodoro 64. - Have you finish throwing away the money? Only a few bucks left to eat... - I can spend them: we all go to lunch at Circeo. - Great. - It's a wonderful idea. Miss, you come too, right? - I can not, I have to leave. - But how! Please come with us! Sure, a trip without a knight is not very fun. Where is Maurizio? - I do not know. -I will be your knight! They are 100 km. If you take more than 45 minutes you pay lunch to everyone. But if I do not fill up you have to pull me! There is a distributor there. No, please! - Why? - Because... it's ugly. I do not like. I'm sorry, but the engine is not so delicate. Will be another time. - Hey, boy, fill it up! - Immediately! But she... is Abbe Lane! Yes. And did she come to me ?! - Yes. Remember you have a station. Wrap up, fill up to Miss Abbe Lane! Cugat, be careful, he is forgetting about you! - Oh, it doesn't matter, I got used to it.. Excuse me, Mr. Cugat. I also admire you very much. Tell me without fear in one ear who admires more: me or him? Tell her, anyhow you don't risk of marry her. - Really? - More than any other woman in the world! You deserve a kiss! The fill is done. - Keep it. With the rest, buy you an ice bag. Hey! Wake up! Have you seen that one behind? It looked like Donatella. He kissed me... on my mouth! Abbe Lane kissed my mouth! Do not you wash your face anymore? Of course! I wash it, I perfume it. You don't know what she did while she was kissing me! She pressed me on my shoulder, and winked an eye! You know what that means, does not it? - No. I tell you, I can conquer her! Did not you see that they were kidding you? What do you want to understand about women? The kiss, the hug, the squeezed eye... She is ready for me! Tonight I ruin myself, but I'll go! And where do you go? - I go to La Cabala and then... - If Donatella finds out... - If he Donatella finds out is because you tell him, understand? - Yes. I'll water you with gas and then I'll fire you! - Where does Miss Guiscardi live? -Appartment 2, up. - Thank you. She lives on the first floor! Have you seen what means to have beautiful sisters? - Do you have any dimes? -Dime? - Yes. How did you say, sorry? I asked you if you got any dime, I would give the guy a tip. - Ah, check it out! - Yes. - Well... - Well, what? Do you have them or not? - No. Then tell and do not waste time! Another time. Good evening. - What will it be? - I do not know. They are not sweets because... it's so light... Let's see it inside. No, let's wait for Donatella, if not she will get angry. Why should she? Because they sent it to her, what do I have to do with it? But you are the father and you have the duty to control. It seems to me an act of mistrust. What are you worried about? It is not a pack sealed with wax. You untie it, then retie it... You will done it quickly. - Yes, I know, but I do not think so. - You are the father! I'm the father... A snoop father. I should be, if I were her father. But you are, because you want to do it for see it inside, for curiosity. I do not care. I'll wait, I'll see it later. And they make such gifts to Donatella... What should they give her? A hat of a bersagliere?(Soldier) In fact is a woman... - Ah, she is a woman, she is no longer a child... Sorry, but here I see the wolf paw! Be '? What happened? You did fight with the other kids, right? They told us that... we have a beautiful sister and... Go to bed. - Good evening, Miss. - Good evening, Pasquale. - Did you have fun, Miss? - No, Pasquale. Trying all day to be another from what you are,... .. be careful about how I spoke, how I move, is not funny. But you don't need to pretend, you are a natural lady! No, Pasquale, drop it,... .. you know well that my real place in houses like these would be in the kitchen. Good evening, Miss. - Good evening! How beautiful flowers! Are them from the garden? - No, Mr. Maurizio sent them. Ah... - There is also a note. - Give it to me, please. - He phoned several times asking of you. - Oh yes? Probably he will still be him. Winston house. If it's for me, tell him I have a headache. Goodbye. Hello. Where's Guido? Don't start, huh? I do not know anything about it. Ask somebody else. Now he is threatening me! Come on, where is he? What do I know? He said he was going to "take some bones"... "The bones went wrong"! Now I shall ocupy myself! There was no hat or newspaper here. Ssh. The table is occupied, you know? Why is it occupied? - Please, come on. Here, please sit down... Please, please sit down. - Hey! 5000 lire? - Yes, sir. - A glass of whiskey ?! I'll fill a truck with 5000 lire! Full! I want a super whiskey! - Lord, they want you out. - Me? - Yes. Hey! Five "bags"! You have't come here to do scenes, huh? - No, I came to talk seriously. - Then we go. You know, I came here because... there was one who was supposed to give me some tickets. Then I wanted to see if you gave me... Let's finish it with lies! I'm tired of hearing it and telling her. You see, it's been a while ago that we are engaged,... .. but maybe just now we find out that he was wrong. Wrong? How do you get her on the tragic! What did I do wrong? I came here a moment... That's not why, is that maybe you still need to be free,... .. you need not feel bound to one like me. And I may need a man who is different. A different man? And how should this man be? Come on, let's hear. I dont know, sweeter, kind,... .. which doesn't always throw me apart to run to another women. And who don't always try to put his hands on me. One who respects me, and really care about me! But I do care about you,... but sometimes there are other women,... but I don't care about them as I care about you,... .. is because... because a man has his rights. You and I are not married. You a serious girl, and what have I to do? - Well, let's go home, come on. - Let's go. - Look there: that isn't Donatella? It's really her! Did you understand, the little virgin? Going around with hadsome guys. - Do you want to see where they go? - Yes, we will have fun! Be attentive, however, avoid that they notice us. - Did you understand anything, you? - No, really. Tomorrow come and get me early, I want to find out everything. Did Dr. Sterzi has come? Not yet. It's all morning that I didn't see him. - Go home and eat, see you at 15:00. - All right. - What are you doing? - Bravo. Give me a passage. But where? I do not have time. Tell Giancarlo to accompany you. Where do I find him? Don't be nasty, don't you see how much stuff I have with me? Take me with your car, it's not far away. Where do I go with you? To a binder, on a crossroad of Via del Mare. - When did you deal with books? - Since a short time. But it's never late to learn, do not you know? You make me wonder.. And that is nothing, the surprises have just begun, my dear. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Does the bookbinder live here? Yes. Augusto? - Eh? - Somebodu ask for you. - Who is it? - One... - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. I wanted to bind these books. It's possible? Of course! We are here for this. Please make yourself confortable.. So, how would you want to bind them? I would not know. Do you have any idea? God, depends on your taste and also by what you want to spend. How did you say? Depends on how much do you want to spend and also by the taste, so let's say... - I do not know, let me see something. - Yes, yes, then, look, we have... This would be in cloth, cloth with the back in leather. Then we have this in pegamoide, which today, we say so... - Excuse me. - You are welcome. It is a bind that holds a lot, or... Excuse me, what are you looking for? This photo... Do you know this girl? Sure, it's my daughter! Why? Have you already seen her? - She gave me her address. - Oh yes? - But... but what happens, excuse me? -Nothing. She twisted you as she wanted, for luck it was Maria and Laura,... .. if no, you could have been cheated. To see her looks so cool, so naive... I would have fallen as well. Believe it was a wonderful girl so different from the others... Different, yes, that is a dirty cheater... .. looking for a crap with a lot of money that she would marry, that's what it is. Yes? They brought a dog from a veterinary clinic. What do I do? Pay and tell them to take it back. - Signorina? - Yes? - Tell them to let him here. - What do you want to do? She wanted to have fun of me, didn't she? Well, now I will have fun of her. - How? - You'll know. What a Love! Poor beast. Thanks for giving it to me. Did you like it? I often think of you, Donatella. - Really? - yes. And she? Yes, of course, too. - Like me? - I do not know this. How do you think? It 's weird, Donatella, we know you recently, in fact,... yet for me it's like if I've known you forever. Maybe because I always wanted a girl like her,... .. I've always been waiting for you, even before I met you. And now that I've finally met you, I don't want to lose you anymore. Donatella, do you know what this means? It means I want you to be mine forever. I want you to be my wife. Do you want? No, Maurizio, I can not. Because... I'm not the girl you believe, the one you have always been waiting for. I should have told you before,I know, but... it was so beautiful... And then, after all, I did not do anything wrong. - But then... Everything would be finished as soon as Mrs. Dorothy returned. Because... I'm just a salaried of Mrs. Dorothy. The villa, the clothes, the college... It's nothing true. I knew that one day it would be all over, as in dreams. And that day I would have disappeared completely... .. and no one else would know anything about me. I would have started my usual life... .. looking for a job at 20,000 lire a month. Forgive me, if I deceived you, I'm not the woman who suitable for you. - But... - Please do not tell me anything. You will not see me again and you will find in your environment the woman who will make her happy. Like me,as I found the man that will marry me. Goodbye. Oh, hello, Maurizio! How did it go? - Hi, dad. - Hello. Sorry... but what are you doing, in the dark? Nothing. - Do you feel bad? - No. I saw that you came in this way and... It's nice, that little dog. Where did you find it? It was a present. - From who? - A friend. About friends, this morning came two friends of yours. - My friends? - Yes, they said that you gave them your address. He is a tall, distinct guy... She called him Maurizio. - Maurizio ?! Was he here? - Yes, why,you know him? - Then he knew everything... - Everything... everything, what? He did not tell me anything. Look, Donatella,... .. you've changed for a while, you're not the one you were anymore. Understand me, I mean you changed your character. I do not know what's going on for you. Of course, I understand that between father and daughter can not be great confidence. If there was your mother, it would be another thing. But let's try to help each other. If you have any problem, tell me. You don't have to... feel ashame your father, understand? Tell me, if something is happening to you. People is chatting,...the fact that you work in that villa, the gift they sent you... My God, you told me everything and I know, but who doesn't know speak badly. See, when one knows another environment, another world,... .. other people, rich people, who have elegant life,... .. you put so many things in your head. Instead you should understand that you are not made for that kind of life,... .. but for living in the middle of the people of your own level,... ..in the world where you was born and have grown up, you know, my daughter? I understand. I don't want to go there anymore, I no longer want to see anyone! Good morning, Mr. Augusto! Hello, Guido. - Is Donatella there? Yes, he is in his room, she hasn't worked today. Well, so she can come out with me. Yes, she can go out with you, but till she prepares... Do me a favor, watch out for that dog. Whose is it? They gave it to Donatella. It's so nice. I'll take it for a short walk. Yes, but take it easy, because it will last more than a half an hour for her getting ready. Then I'll be back in half an hour. - Yes, in half an hour, don't worry. - Goodbye. Careful to the dogs catchers. Sorry, but that is your daughter's boyfriend and you sent him to walk his dog? If it were a race dog but it's a bastard! Why? The poor bastards have no right... No, I do not say this, but a dog what is it for? I understand a horse... You always make the usual talk. - What did Dinamite yesterday? - He did not even enter . You did not want to bet on Battifiacca... How could I bet on a horse that is called Battifiacca?(slow one) - Hi, Guido. - Ah, hello. How's the job going? To tell the truth, I'm better with animals than with people. - But is't this the dog who came to us? Do you know him? It was our client. His master has given me a nice tip. His master? And who is it? I do not know, a nice guy with a lot of money. He asked to treat it well. But how come is he here with you? It's from Donatella, they gave it to them. Lucky her because she receives so many presents. Gifts? Which gifts? The other day seems to have received an underwear all of lace. Chic stuff, tailoring. Do not make it run too much, is not healed yet . Bye Bye. - Then it is true! - What? Now you begin too! Who is this? What are you doing there dressed like this? Who gave you the dress? The same one who gave you the underwear and the dog ?! And me, like a stupid carry your lover's dog! But what lover ?! A bastard like you...You are all the same! I do not want to see anyone anymore! Of course you do not see me anymore! But what happens? Donatella, but what are you doing? You are crying? I was hoping that at least Guido would understand me, and instead... Instead you fell in love with another, admit it. Don't interfere, too! I'm not in love with anyone, do you understand ?! Why would you answer me so? I put you a question without malice. Okay, no one, not even Guido. So he did right to leave. If he loved me, he would have no doubt about me. I did not do anything wrong! I took a photo, this is all I did! A photo? Which one? Is this the picture? And who is this young man? This is what came to bring the books that day. I did not do anything. And... now you listen to the facts of the others. I wish you don't think that I was curious. I heard screams, I saw Guido run away... Yes, they quarreled. You know, those are like two kids. If I understand well ,the girl has two lovers. How do you talk like this, Nicola? The girl only has Guido. - And that other one? - There are no others. That one is a young man whom she met, he invited her to dance... You know how they do today, they accept right away... They took a photo together, he saw her... - It would be that of the book. - You didn't miss a word. You are not curious, but you have a hearing... Yes, that one in the book, so he was angry and... They separated one from another. They separated one from another.... They bickered. Now they need to reconcile. In fact, I must find this young man. If he is a righteous person, he will have to clarify the misunderstanding... - I believe my daughter. - Do you know where this young man lives? She met her in a villa, They'll tell me where he lives... I find him, I will speak to him... I say goodbye to you, I make him a surprise... - But how, and me? - What have you got with it? Apart from the fact that I am part of the family, I have a taxi, I accompany you. I know, but since I told you I have to make a surprise... I do not understand, today is sunny, it should go... I think that if the weather changes... I think if you change the car all will go better! - So what do you do? - Good morning. - Is this car starting or no? We would go, but the car doesn't want to follow us. Do you leave it here, on the road? And who gets it? It's half an hour that we're trying to get her off. I know that nobody gets it, but there it disturbs. If you leave it there, I'll do you a fine. - That's right, do it to him. No, gentlemen, no fine. Now, with a little patience, we push it a little further down. A little down? Much down! Where, much lower down? There, at least behind the church. I greet you, I take another taxi. - And you leave me alone? Stop the discussion, the car can not stand here. - Look, the car is not mine, this must be understood. - All right, move it. This one doesn't even go downhill. Come on, push! Go! That one says, "Go...". This doesn't go with gasoline, goes with pushes. - Good morning. Please, gentlemen, what do you wish? Good morning. Please, Elvira. Good morning gentlemen. Good morning. What do you wish? Excuse me, sir, we are looking for a certain Pasquale. A waiter, the servant of some of our friends. Mrs. Winston's waiter. I believe. - It's me. - Ah, you are Pasquale, the waiter? Yes. Exactly you? Exactly me. Sorry, tell me what you want, but I'm in a hurry. Oh, you are in a hurry? A poor girl is mixed up thrown into the mud,... .. to which you have to return reputation, honor... Nicola, we are not reciting "The blind of Sorrento"... - Well, who are you? - I am the father. - But whose father? - Of the blind. - Of Donatella. - Ah, of Miss Donatella? - Yes. - Why has't she come anymore? She did not come because she will not come anymore. Me, the father, have come, looking for Mr Pasquale, which is you, isn't you? - Yes. - Are you Pasquale? - Yes, I am Pasquale. I should have a courtesy. I should ask for information. - Ask . - Yes, then... - Ask, ask. If you tell me, "Ask, ask,"... These are difficult speeches... He is right, I understand, but sorry... - Where is Mr. Maurizio? - He is in, but is in a hurry, he is leaving. - What is it? - Excuse me, but here is Miss Donatella's father... You should ask him something. - Yes. I must also make my apologies for how I behaved yesterday. I did not come for this, I came for... - The gentleman should ask her a favor. - That's right. - Yes, say. - Well, I should ask her a favor. You see, my daughter is engaged with a young man... Hey, here's the honor of your daughter, yours and mine. They are not things that can be discussed in the street. - We can get in the car. - We don't manage to talk! - Come. Donatella, there is dad in the car! There are also other men. Maybe he have been arrested? The police don't have such a car. Very kind. The distributor is here behind, but you have to go round there. I thank you so much for courtesy. If this boy really wants your daughter, I will convince him at once. All the best. Thanks, the same to you. What did you do? What did you tell him? Good boy, that one. You will see that he will fix everything. Ah, yes? Now I fix him! Wrap, clean the glasses. - Do you want gasoline? - No. Water? Oil? - No thanks. I have to speak to you. To me? - Yes, about Donatella. - Donatella? - Precisely. - Ah, but you are... Yes, I'm Maurizio Del Pre . I think you heard about me. Of course, you are the one with the dog, that one from the photo,... .. the one that fascinates the girls because he doesn't touch them... I did not come to fight,... .. but to clarify the equivocal of which Donatella is the victim. Ah, yes? And how? I know you want to break your engagement for my fault. Why? Do not I have the right? No, you have no right to suspect a girl like Donatella. You should know that your suspects are absurd if you know her well. Instead you know well Donatella... Now yes, and I appreciate her more than any other woman I have ever known. If I hadn' been in love with another,... .. this time I would be to her to ask her to become my wife. And you, Donatella, what do you think? Of course!Mr. Maurizio has made me the honor to propose me once. Donatella, I assure you that yesterday I didn't know, I misjudged you. So why are you telling so many sermons to Guido? After all, he behaved better than you. He didn't make fun of me. He honestly said what he thought. Maybe he didn't act as a gentleman... .. but if all the gentlemen are like you, I'd prefer to stay away! Donatella, I know I behaved badly, but I thought... Did you think I wanted to hit? Catch you with all your money and settle down, huh? You must understand that: a poor girl like me can be honest and disinterested, ... .. and not a hypocrite who make fun playing with the feelings of the others... in the manner you or the guys like you are doing! It is true, you are right. Excuse me. - Everything done. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Are you sorry? - What do I care about? - Then why are you angry? Why? Didn't I have to get angry? One that doesn't matter anything is not as angry as you were angry. What would you say? That me and that one... No, I do not say that between you and him there was something, but... The fact is that I can not marry a girl in love with another. So you know me better? Yes, because, you see, you do not have the courage to tell... .. and then I tell you. Are you sure? Really, it also seems to me. - But by now, so far it went... - If you run, you can catch it. How do I do it? He said he was flying. - That one is behind the corner. - And how do you know it? I tossed the carburettor to not let it get more gas. He can't run more than 200 meters. Well, at least a kiss has remedied you. Certainly! I kiss the women! First I have fun with them, then I get them married to others. Okay, where has she go? At him, no? At the one she has to marry her. - And did you let her go? - I'm not fit for marriage. I must remain free, free to choose the woman I want. And then, I got stubby too of Abbe Lane. Look... So! This is my new lady. Do you like her?
