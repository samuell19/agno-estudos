EXACTLY WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? WELL, IT'S A LONG... I CAN'T HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.

WELL, THERE'S NO USE LEAVING IT WRAPPED THEN IS THERE. ROGER. WHAT? HE'S NOT JUST ECCENTRIC, HE HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. LET'S PLAY. HOW'S THAT MY PROBLEM? WELL YOU BETTER ASK YOUR MOM. IT HAPPENED ABOUT A YEAR AGO, RIGHT AFTER YOUR MOTHER DIED. HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MY MOTHER? THAT'S WHAT I DO. I FIND OUT THINGS. MOM. FRED'S CO-WORKERS SAID HE JUST CHUCKED EVERYTHING. CAREER, COMPANY, CASH... NOT NOW HONEY. I THINK THE GUY NEEDS HELP. MOM, CAN I PLAY SOCCER? YES, JUST DON'T GET DIRTY. YAY! OKAY, LET'S GO. ROGER, YOU BE THE GOALIE. I'M SORRY, BUT FRED IS NOT MY PROBLEM. BUT WHAT IF HE IS YOUR FATHER? HE IS NOT MY FATHER. BEN MCMANNUS WAS MY FATHER. BESIDES HE HAS HIS PEOPLE. NO, NO, HE RETIRED ALL HIS HELP. GAVE THEM FAT PENSIONS. ARTHUR IS JUST HAUSE HE'S . SHOOT, NICE MOVE. YES, YES. I'VE GOT TO GET MY SON. TREVOR, TREVOR, LET'S GO. BUT YOU SAID I COULD PLAY. LET'S GO. OH NO! NEVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE HAVE I SCORED A GOAL IN ANYTHING! NOW WHO WANTS SOME HOT CHOCOLATE? ME! OKAY, LET'S GO. TREVOR. ROGER. NICE MATCH. THANK YOU SIR. TREVOR, DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING. THAT'S OKAY, WE COULD PROBABLY HAVE A SOCCER MATCH IN HERE EH? TREVOR, COME ON. DO YOU LIKE MARSHMALLOWS? WHAT COLOUR OF MARSHMALLOWS DO YOU LIKE? DO YOU LIKE WHITE ONES? WELL, HOW ABOUT A TOASTY FIRE? WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS THING WORK. I USED TO HAVE A FIRE GUY... BUT... I NEED SOME STRAIGHT ANSWERS. WELL, YOU DESERVE THEM. SHOOT. WHY ARE YOU LYING ABOUT BEING MY FATHER? I AM NOT LYING. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LAY THIS OUT FOR ME. WHEN BEN AND GRACE WERE DATING, HE INVESTED EVERYTHING HE HAD INTO SOME OIL FIELD SPECULATIONS, THEN HE WENT BUST AND HE JUST PUSHED GRACE AWAY- OUT OF SHAME I GUESS. SO WHAT? YOU CAME SWOOPING IN? WELL, YOUR MOTHER AND I WE, WE DID SPEND THE WEEKEND TOGETHER SARATOGA, WATCHING HORSE RACES. SHE WAS REALLY SOMETHING THE WAY SHE'D STAND UP IN HER SEAT AND JUST SORT OF YELL HER HORSE ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. ANYWAY, THAT WEEKEND... WE... THAT'S WHEN YOU WERE... YOU CAN SKIP THE DETAILS. WELL, WHEN BEN CAME TO HIS SENSES, HE BEGGED GRACE TO LET HIM COME BACK AND SHE REALLY LOVED HIM, SO THEY WERE MARRIED WITHIN A MONTH... AND I COULDN'T BLAME HER. BEN WAS A GOOD MAN. LOUSY AT BUSINESS, BUT GOOD AT OTHER THINGS. BEN WAS ALL HEART. SO DID HE KNOW THAT I WASN'T HIS CHILD? OH, LORD NO. I PROMISED GRACE. IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN HIS HEART. I SAID I WOULD NEVER TELL AND THAT WAS THAT. HE DIED NEVER KNOWING, AND THEN WHEN YOUR MOTHER FELL ILL, I WENT TO VISIT HER IN THE HOSPITAL AND THAT IS WHEN SHE GAVE ME HER BLESSING TO MEET YOU. I REALIZED HOW MUCH I HAD MISSED... I DIDN'T SEE YOU GROW UP. WHY DIDN'T MY MOTHER WANT ME TO KNOW YOU BEFORE THAT? WELL, SEE... I WAS THE ONE WHO CONVINCED BEN TO INVEST IN THOSE OIL FIELDS. I WAS YOUNG, BRASH, THOUGHT I COULD SMELL OIL IN THE DIRT. MADE A MISTAKE, AND THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME PART OF ME WAS HAPPY, I GUESS, WHEN HE LOST EVERYTHING. SEE I WANTED GRACE AND I THOUGHT IF BEN DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY, THEN SHE'D WANT ME INSTEAD OF HIM. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS DAY WAS ABOUT? TRYING TO BUY MY LOVE THE WAY YOU TRIED TO BUY MY MOTHER'S? NO, NO. YOU THINK THAT GIVING ME YOUR MONEY MAKES UP FOR WHAT YOU DID TO MY FATHER? NO, I KNOW THAT DOESN'T WORK. THEN WHAT? MONEY MEANS NOTHING. I WOULD GIVE IT ALL AWAY. I JUST WANT A FAMILY. MY FAMILY. GET THIS STRAIGHT. TREVOR AND I AREN'T YOUR FAMILY. WE WILL NEVER BE YOUR FAMILY. SO JUST TAKE ALL YOUR RICHES AND MERRY FRIGGIN' CHRISTMAS. LET'S GO. BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO. WELL, WE HAVE TO GET HOME TO DECORATE THE TREE. HEY, HEY, WWWAIT. WHY? SO YOU CAN GET MORE MISERY FOR THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK NEWS? SHANNON WHAT'S UP? TALK TO ME. YOU CAN ROLL ON THIS... FRED NICHOLS IS A CHEAT AND A THIEF AND I'M GOING TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HIM. THAT'S THE ENDING TO YOUR STORY. TICK-TOCK GUYS. TEN MORE MINUTES. GET FIVE OR ELSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A BLACK HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BROADCAST. GET OUT! OKAY, THAT'S GOOD. PLAY IT BACK. NOW I JUST NEED AN ENDING. [KNOCK ON DOOR] I SAID OUT. I GUESS I HAD THAT COMING. HEY LITTLE FELLA, WANT TO PHOTOCOPY YOUR FACE? CAN I? YES, JUST DON'T GET IN ANYONE'S WAY. LET'S GO. I GOT HALFWAY HOME AND I HAD TO COME BACK. WHAT I SAID ABOUT NICHOLS? I WAS PISSED. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HURT HIM. OH, TALK ABOUT A 180. I KNOW. AND I KNOW THAT THAT SLEAZY EXPLOITATION MAKES FOR A BETTER STORY, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO USE IT, PLEASE. HE SUFFERED ENOUGH. SO WHY THE SUDDEN TURN? I GUESS I JUST WANT IT ALL TO BE OVER. THAT'S A LOT TO ASK HERE AT THE LAST MINUTE. HAD TO GIVE IT A SHOT. YOU KNOW I LOOKED AT NICHOLS AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE? I SEE A GUY WHO HAS PRETTY MUCH GOTTEN EVERYTHING HE EVER WANTED IN LIFE, BUT NOTHING HE REALLY NEEDED. MUST HAVE BEEN TOUGH FOR HIM ALL THESE YEARS WATCHING HIS ONLY KID GROW UP, NOT EVEN BEING ABLE TO TALK TO HER. WELL, HE DID A DANDY JOB OF TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR IT TODAY. I GUESS HE DIDN'T GET MUCH PRACTICE ON HIS HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS. BUT THEN AGAIN, WE'VE ALL BUILT OUR WALLS. WHAT? YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY? YOU KNOW, I JUDGE PEOPLE ON THEIR ACTIONS. FRED NICHOLS USED HIS POWER TO RUIN MY FATHER. HE BROKE HIS SPIRIT. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I CAN FORGET. YOU KNOW WHAT, JUST DO WHAT EVER YOU WANT WITH THE STORY. OH WAIT... YOU... HEY, EAT FIRST. TREE, SECOND. TV? SURE. [SOUND OF TV IN BACKGROUND...] WHICH ONE IS THAT? THAT'S GRAND POP, GRAND MOM AND ME, WHEN I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE. I REMEMBER THAT ONE. [TV IN BACKGROUND] IT'S THE FUNNY MAN. PETER: WELL, I HAVE HAD QUITE A DAY FOLLOWING AROUND THIS CITY'S SECRET SANTA, SURPRISES AT EVERY TURN. BUT HE SAVED THE BIGGEST SURPRISE FOR LAST - THE REASON WHY HE WAS DOING IT. I WANT TO SEE. FRED: I DO IT FOR THE MOST SELFISH REASON IMAGINED. IT'S US! I DO IT FOR THE SMILES. SEEING THE PLEASURE ON A CHILD'S FACE RECEIVING A NEW TOY... A MOTHER GETTING ENOUGH CASH TO PAY THE NEXT MONTH'S RENT... ...IT'S ADDICTIVE. YOU CAN GET HOOKED TOO. TRY BAKING A CAKE FOR A NEIGHBOUR YOU'VE NEVER MET, OR BUYING A MEAL FOR A HOMELESS PERSON, HELP A STRANGER FIX A FLAT TIRE. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE DAY, ALL WE REALLY HAVE IS EACH OTHER. WE'RE ALL FAMILY. PETER: IT COULDN'T BE MORE SIMPLE THAN THAT. I'M PETER ARCHER. HAVE YOURSELVES A MERRY CHRISTMAS. OR AS THEY SAY IN ROMANIA... [UNCLEAR]. NOW ALL YOU KIDS OUT THERE GET TO BED BECAUSE SANTA IS ON HIS WAY. [KNOCKING] YO, MR. N? OVER HERE. MERRY CHRISTMAS. WELL, LOOK AT THAT? ARE THOSE GIFTS GOING TO THE USUAL PLACE AGAIN THIS YEAR? YES. IT'S BEEN WHAT? SIX OR SEVEN YEARS YOU'RE DOING THIS, THAT'S GOT TO BE THE BIGGEST HAUL YET MR. N. ROGER IF YOU COULD CALL A CAB AND PACK THEM UP FOR DELIVERY. WE'RE GOING TO NEED THREE. I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT. OH YEAH, THE MRS. WANTED ME TO GIVE YOU THIS. IT'S A FRUIT CAKE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING, THAT WE GOT THIS AND WE'RE PROBABLY PASSING IT ALONG, BUT SHE DID MAKE IT FRESH. OH, THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL. PLEASE THANK YOUR WIFE FOR ME ROGER. I WILL SIR. IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING SO MR. N, YOU LOOK PRETTY BLUE. LET ME TAKE A GUESS. IS IT FAMILY? YEAH. HOLIDAYS. SUPPOSED TO BE THIS GREAT TIME AND ALL THAT, BUT I THINK IT JUST DRIVES PEOPLE MENTAL. AND YOU KNOW, IN THE END AFTER ALL THE YELLING AND SCREAMING AND FIGHTING OVER WHO CARVES THE TURKEY, IT CAN BE PRETTY NICE. NO MATTER WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HOLD ON TO THOSE CHRISTMAS SMILES. ROGER, CALL 4 CABS. I'M GOING TO NEED ONE. YES SIR. THANKS MOM. [TELEPHONE RINGING] HELLO? PETER? IT'S CRAZY DOWN HERE. THE PHONES ARE RINGING OFF THE HOOK. PEOPLE ARE TRIPPING OVER THEMSELVES TO BE NICE TO EACH OTHER. GIVING STUFF AWAY. PINNING IT ON THIS NICHOLS GUY. I NEED YOU TO GET A FOLLOWUP WITH HIM. WELL, IT JUST SO HAPPENS I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO THIS MORNING. YEAH, WELL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME PACKING TO DO. THAT D.C. GIG YOU'VE BEEN BUSTING MY CHOPS ABOUT, IT'S YOURS. YOU HEAR ME? PETER? YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO STAY HERE. WE MUST HAVE A BAD CONNECTION. DID YOU JUST SAY... ? YEAH, I'M RECOMMENDING LAUREN FOR THE JOB. BUT DON'T TELL HER I SAID THAT. IT'LL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET. I DON'T GET IT. WHAT GIVES? LET'S JUST SAY, THIS CITY SEEMS A LITTLE MORE ATTRACTIVE THIS MORNING. BYE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MR. NICHOLS YOU JUT MISSED HIM. WHERE'D HE GO? I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD SAY ANYTHING. MR. NICHOLS HAS BEEN KEEPING THIS ON THE Q/T FOR YEARS. IT'S LIKE YOU SAID ON YOUR THING LAST NIGHT, JUST DO GOOD STUFF. CAN YOU HELP ME OUT WITH THIS PLEASE? IT'S IMPORTANT. WELL, ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM ME. THANKS. HEY LOOK. HEY, THAT LOOKS GREAT. WHAT DID YOUR DADDY SEND YOU? DADDY SENT ME A JUNIOR DENTAL KIT. CAN I SCRUB MRS. GRANGER'S CAT WITH THIS? SURE. SO YOU'RE NOT DISAPPOINTED YOU DIDN'T GET A SUPER BIKE? IT'S OKAY. I JUST LIKE HAVING YOU FOR MY PRESENT. AND I GOT TO RIDE IN THE BACK OF THE LIMO. COME HERE YOU. HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY HOW SPECIAL YOU ARE? [KNOCK ON DOOR] I'LL GET IT. IT'S THE TV GUY. HIS NAME IS MR. ARCHER. TV GUY IS FINE.

WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR HOT CHOCOLATE? SURE. HEY, IS THIS YOU? YEAH. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT LOOKING AT THIS THING. I THINK MAYBE BEN KNEW ALL ALONG THAT I WASN'T HIS DAUGHTER, BUT HE NEVER LET ON. HE NEVER LOVED ME ANY LESS. I WAS GRACE'S DAUGHTER AND THAT'S ALL HE NEEDED. WE WERE HAPPY. POOR BUT HAPPY. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. NOTHING AT ALL. I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY MY MOM CHANGED HER MIND AND LET NICHOLS OFF THE HOOK. I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE. RIGHT NOW? YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS. [CHATTER OF CHILDREN IN BACKGROUND] GUYS, YOU'VE GOT SOME GIFTS RIGHT OVER THERE. HO, HO, HO, MERRY CHRISTMAS. HEY, LOOK. IT'S THE FUNNY MAN.

YEAH OKAY, WE'LL SET UP FOR A CREW TO COME IN SOME TIME NEXT WEEK. OKAY. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME HERE. ACTUALLY I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE. I DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE ANYMORE CONFESSIONS. I BROKE A RULE OF JOURNALISM. WHICH IS? NEVER GET PERSONALLY INVOLVED WITH THE SUBJECT OF YOUR STORY. YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA FIND A WAY TO MAKE US GO OUT AND I'M GOING TO FIND IT PRETTY HARD TO SAY NO. WELL, JUST TO KEEP HIM QUIET, MAYBE WE COULD GO FOR LUNCH. OR DINNER.
