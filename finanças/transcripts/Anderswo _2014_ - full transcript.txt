Anywhere Else Are you recording? I also want to analyse the body language. So... "Saudade". I don't think it can really be translated. If you translate it, "It's 'saudade'", it's like desire, but at the same time something like melancholy. But no, it's not the same. When you say "saudade", it's like, you love something so much and you have the feeling you've lost it forever. And you'll never get it back. Just saying the word, I already feel saudade. So it's a no, isn't it? I'm very sorry, but the committee decided for another applicant. I really can't make it without that scholarship. I know. But your project isn't at the level of your previous work. I'm still working on it. It's still in development. Yes, but a dictionary of untranslatable words is not a scientific work, it's a paradox. It wasn't clear what you intend to do. No one on the commission knew where you are heading. You have to really think about what exactly your objective is and how to present it better. So that we understand it too. Can't we talk about it like normal people? Why? You've already decided. - No, I haven't. It's just an audition. You'll be accepted, and you know it. Then I won't go. Fine. Don't we want to just wait and see what happens? Stuttgart will be what happens! So? It's just another city. We can live there too. You can live there. - So can you. There are Unis, libraries... And what else would I do? Eat spätzle? You don't even know it. You've never been outside Berlin. And there's a reason why. Noa, it's impossible to talk to you. What? - Thanks. Thank you. A word that I'm always missing, when nothing's going right and I'm having a bad day... Want to say hi to my mom? I always say hi to your dad. What's up, Noa? Nothing. "Magone" is... It's a feeling, a heavy feeling in the stomach, right down in the guts. You can't even explain why... You just feel this pressure, and you have this heavy thing... "Magone"... Taste good? If you'd just do your writing, you wouldn't need this psycho shit. It's that easy? Great. I'll get right on that. I've never been to Leipzig. Maybe I'll come with you. Don't you think you have enough to do here? You look good. Thanks. You're welcome. I'll come back right after the concert tomorrow. Brush your teeth and do your work. Yeah. Good luck. "Wabi" and "sabi" mean different things, but the ideas are about the same. And... "wabi" means... Mama! Noa? Noa'le, what are you doing here? - I just arrived. Why didn't you tell me? - It's a surprise! Oh my god! You almost gave me a heart attack. Let me look at you. You look good. - I do? Yeah, but pale. Put your hair down! You scared me! I thought something happened. You can't just show up like that. - I'm hungry. Did you tell anyone? - No. Does Dad know? - No. You'll get some sun here. I'll make you something to eat. What do we have? I'll put all we have out on the table. I'm surprised too. The food's better here than in Germany, right? Don't forget to breathe. Say hi to Grandma. Tomorrow is David's birthday. Hi, Grandma. Yeah, everything's fine. No, everything's OK! - Auntie Noa. Say "Noa". Leave her, she doesn't even know her. Grandma, I can't hear you. We'll talk tomorrow. Kisses. Kisses! Dad, what's that? Nothing, just a hernia. - What? He built a security shelter. He thinks he's 20. Why didn't you tell me? Like that would've helped. Where is the security shelter? - In the garden. Dudi! Look who's here! Who is this handsome soldier? - What are you doing here? You never know with her. What's up with this hair? - And what about yours? Let it down! It suits you better. Dudi! Stop it, I'll fix you a plate. Later. No wonder everyone hates us. - Come on, Noa! Shame on you! The rockets are already hitting Tel Aviv! Why do you even take her seriously? OK, relax! Here, stay calm, good TV... Change the channel. Today they're kicking somebody out. Right! - I wanna see the news. Come here, Neta! Nora'le! They're voting out the gay one. It's so nice to have the whole family together. Hey, what's up? - Jörgi. Where are you? I'm home. No, you are not. I am at home. Where are you? No smoking in the house! Did you hear that? That was my mom. What is going on? You can't imagine how the air tastes here. You always have salty lips. Jörg? Look what I made for you. Your favourite cake. With oranges, fresh from the garden. Grandma sent me out at seven this morning to buy flour. Why didn't you call? Have a piece. Grandma, it looks delicious. - Taste it. We'll take it with us. Mom's waiting. Just take a piece. - OK. Rose'le, what about the basket? Is it ready? - Yes. Delicious! - Good. Take another one. - That's enough, Grandma. I'll pack it up. How can you stand the cold weather there? You get used to everything. How long are you staying? - Until tomorrow. Short. - Yeah. I have a lot of work to do there. Grandma, should I finally frame this photo? - Which one? I'll look for a nice frame. This one. - Beautiful picture. Oy, I missed you. (Yiddish) May you always be well. Yalla, Grandma. You know her. She's getting anxious. Let her. Grandma, come on. - Finally! My darling, how are you? Come on in. (Yiddish) Why are we always running late? I've been waiting in the car for an hour! And I've been waiting on my feet all morning. Of course, it's always my fault. What's the hurry? No one is walking away. Have a sandwich! - No, Grandma. I'm full. You have to eat more! - No, Grandma. You've lost weight! Eat! - I have not lost weight! I want a sandwich too. - You don't need one! He was here last time too. - Yes. His son was killed in action ten years ago. He's been here every day since. He left behind his house, his whole life. He just sits there. Mrs. Abramovicz! Have you seen how beautiful the flowers are? Yes, lovely. Come here. Come over here! Take it! I'm not allowed. Take it! You won't get anything from the dead. Here! Mama! Leave him alone! Don't you tell me what to do! Does Grandma already know about Jörg? No, so keep your mouth shut! Oy, I just don't feel well today. What do they think of us in Germany? Who cares? It doesn't matter to you? None of it is relevant. This nationalism has no future. It's nothing, a child's game. We're just a comma in history. You're flying above yourself. - What? You're flying. - Is that new, that flying thing? You're such a freak. Hey, take your own! - Are you stockpiling pills now? Mine are almost gone. Relax. I'll give you some of mine later. Then give me one too. Sometimes it's OK to take two. - Go to sleep, that always helps. Then give me the Rescue Night. Is it good? - It can't hurt. "Stam" is sort of a mix of several different meanings. "Just because", "no reason", "it's not important", "leave me alone". It's a very useful word. For example: "What are you doing here?" "Stam." "Why didn't you do what you were supposed to do?" "Stam." "What is the meaning of everything?" "Stam." I thought Mom was driving me. What are you doing here? Why aren't you at the airport? You think I'd go when Grandma is in hospital? You won't get a refund. We're not millionaires! What's money got to do with it? - And your work? I can write it from here. - Of course you can! I can't deal with that right now. Do whatever you want. Where is Grandma? - Being examined. What do they say? - Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? - Don't yell at me! I have a headache. Jörg, my family really needs me right now. Jörg, can you hear me? - Yes. OK. Don't you have anything else to say? Should I say something? And? What are you up to? I'm sitting at the computer. There's mail for you from the Uni. Should I open it? If you have to. Should I open it or not? - Sure, open it. It says, "Dear Ms..." It says you haven't paid your school fees. Oh, yeah, I forgot. You have ten days to transfer it or you'll be exmatriculated. OK, I'll do it tomorrow. Dudi! Come here a minute. This is Dudi, my brother. Dudi, Jörg. Go. Go! Two, two. Good, Grandma! Dudi, tell your commander, you have to leave. Tell him your grandma... It's an emergency. Where are you going? Six, two. You can build a house. Would you just sit down! You're making me dizzy. Right, everything's my fault. Yeah, OK. Bye. Quiet! She's fallen asleep. Noa? Want some? - No. They have 18 calories each. - I don't want any. What's going to happen? Yoav! How did you know we were here? My mother told me Henja was here. Noa! Look who's here. Hi! - Hi, Noa. What are you doing here? - A doctor! Are you back, Noa? - No, no. She's finishing her Masters and coming straight back. Right? We'll see. Ah, Dr. Abdallah. - I don't really trust him. Mama! Rachel, don't worry. He is an excellent doctor. Really? - Yes. So why is she sleeping all the time? - It's the medication. How is Berlin, Noa? - Cool. I'm going there this summer. - Really. She knows the whole city. She can show you the whole... everything. So we'll be in touch. - Sure. OK. Say hello to your mom. - I will. Bye, Noa. Have you no shame? I've never seen such a thing! Did you see how she behaved, Rose? She did this while he talked to her. With her hair. Shame on you! What will Yoav think of you? - I don't give a crap. If only you had brains. You'll never find a man like him again. Mama, leave me alone! I don't feel well. - You don't feel well? I don't feel well, because I raised you better than that! I taught you to be neat and polite. No matter what a man asks you, you say "Wonderful! Everything's roses!" Neta'le. My darling. Is that for me? - Of course. Such a good girl. Is she still asleep? - It's the medication. And her? - Her? She is intolerable. Did you forget about her moods? - Look who's talking! Noa! I'm not in the mood right now. Does it bother you that I'm here? Don't you even talk to me! Girls, quiet now! Think of Grandma. Rose, we don't have to be also you, also me, also her here. Go home. Are you sure? No, wait, Mom! - Sure. Positive. Go home. Who's picking up Nora? I have to work. She will. Absolutely not! I'd rather have Bin Laden do it. Bin Laden is dead, you idiot! What are you looking at me, Rose? Go home! Hello. - Hello, who are you? Noa. I'm picking up Nora today. Are you the aunt from Germany? - Yes. Come here, sweetie. Excuse me? - Yes? That's not Nora. Ah! You are so sweet. Just like Nora. - That's Daniela. Come on, sweetie. Yummy, huh? Do you want to write "Mama" and "Papa"? Pa... pa. Very nice! What are you writing? "Summer". Nice! PAPA MAMA Mama, I want to go home. What? Did you say something? There is a word in Arabic. It's "toqborni". You can't really translate it into German. To put it simply, it means, "May you bury me, put me in the grave", which is something very bad. But the meaning is different. Many mothers say this to their sons. It means, "I want to die before you, and you should bury me." "I don't want to live through the pain, if you die before me." "I don't want to experience that." Mama. - What? I'm hungry. There's quiche in the fridge you can heat up. Papa? What's going to happen? Nothing. Complaining doesn't help. The white coat suits you. Official. - Looks authoritative. I am authoritative. - Since when? Since always. - Do people buy it? The sick ones die for me. And what about you? What are you up to? Seriously? Yeah. So you work here, and then? Are you making fun of me? - No, you sensitive thing. I just want to know what you do. - Different stuff. What? Meet up with friends? - That too. Basketball on Thursdays with Tuval and Rani? Yalla. - Are you offended? Not by you anymore, Noa. Do you want to do something? - What? I don't know. Meet, do something. We'll see. How long are you staying? Until Grandma is better. She won't get better. - Until she goes home. She won't leave the hospital. I already told your mother. Her condition is very bad. Noa'le, you're here? Yes. Good. Of course I'm here. Are you back now? Yes. Good. Good. Have you finished your work there? Yes. - Good. What did you write about? About home. Do you know where my jewellery is? Yes. Bring it to me. I want to give it to you girls. Mama. How are you feeling? Did she have something to drink? No. Mama! If you want to get well, you have to drink something. You're putting me in the grave. Leave me alone. David'le. My child. 95. Fill it up, please. So what's going to come of you? Making progress on your thesis? - Yes. And then what? - Nothing. As long as everybody thinks you're making a career in Germany. OK, bye. - What do you mean, "bye"? I can't sleep at night because of you. I'm not young anymore. I'm tired. I'm not what I used to be. You want your kids to not have a grandma? Go right ahead. What a mistake I made to let you waste all these years there. Why did I ever allow it? Good thing I didn't ask you. It's not normal to live that way. Anyone would go crazy. You're the only one who's driving me crazy! I can't change myself. But you can. You're 33. Make a decision! Where are you going when I'm talking to you? Hello? - Shalom. Shalom? - Who's speaking? Excuse me, but who am I speaking with? This is Oleg, from Arrivals Security at the airport. Am I speaking with Noa? No, you're speaking with her mother, Rachel. CZERNOWITZ, 1938 Don't pick the hard ones. Is this one good? - Yes. I haven't eaten them in years. Where does Grandma keep her recipes? In her head. And how do we make the marmalade? - I'll do it. Do you know how? Who do you think made your cake? Your grandma hasn't cooked in years. You cook everything? - Yes. Even gefilte fish? - Yes. Isn't it disgusting? You get used to everything. Shalom. Are you Oleg? Mrs. Rachel? - Yes. Gutterman. And? Where is he? What's the problem? That's our business. What's your connection to him? He's my daughter's boyfriend. Is he Jewish? Excuse me, that's none of your business. - True. It's yours. OK, you can talk to him. - Thank you, Oleg. (Yiddish) Oy, you're so tall! I'm Rachel. Noa's mother. Rachel. Hello. I'm Jörg. Nice to meet you. You speak German? - Just a little. It's a pleasure to meet you. - Pardon me? Oh, right. Me too. Is Noa here? - No. No. Does Noa know you're here? Does Noa know you're coming to Israel? No, it was supposed to be a surprise. For me too. Alright. Sorry. Why are you here? I don't understand what... The police called me. What are you schlepping in your suitcase? That's my trombone. I'm a musician. Ah, klezmer! I'm sorry. I didn't want to cause trouble. No, it's OK. Everything's fine. Everything's OK? - Yes. Just write. I'll get a hotel. - No, you're not getting a hotel. You're my daughter's boyfriend. (Hebrew) I'm going to kill this girl. You are my... guest. How long are you staying? - Two days. Can't be that dangerous. Thank you, Oleg! Shall we? Take the trumpet. - Good. OK. Thank you. Jurk, get out! Stand like this. For the soldiers. Noa, not now! Don't laugh! That was just what I needed. What does he want? Would you say that about Neta's husband too? - That's not the same. He's not right for you. Believe me. Mama, I beg you, don't embarrass me. Me? Embarrass you? I don't believe it! The Prince of Bavaria. Dudi, come eat something! Here you go. - Thank you. I can't eat all this. Noa, translate for him! - He understands English. He understands German better. Just nod your head "yes", and he'll be happy. Dad, enough! - Yossi, leave him alone. Jurk, sorry. What do your parents do? My father is an architect. And my mother is dead. - Oh my. What? - His mother is dead. Mama, leave it. Rachel, the salt. Dad, you're frying his brain. He hasn't spoken with me this much since we got married. Suddenly he talks. Salt, here you go. Get out! - Be quiet. What's up with your brother? Why? Did he say something? No, nothing. Just... Never mind. (Hebrew) Would you shut up! Did you bring that with you? It's your brother's. Schweinsteiger. Noa! Quiet! Dudi, knock it off! (Hebrew) What a crazy family. I can't believe that you're really here. Are you happy I came? Can't you tell that I am? Why didn't you pay your school fees? I'll handle it. That's not good enough for me. I want to know why. Please give me an answer. Noa, I just don't understand. Please talk to me! - My thesis is shit. No, it's brilliant. - No, it's absolute shit. Then write it better. It can't be written any better. It can't even be written at all. You can't translate anything. Nothing. Not bed, not wall, not house, not parents, not love. It's just shit. Don't you understand? (Hebrew) You just don't understand me. Yes, I do. You want to stay here. Jörg, I'm really happy that you came. I'm really, really happy. Noa, I can't breathe. I'm going to take a shower. Can I have a towel? There are some in the bathroom. "Matje." "Curse the street" is what it means literally. But it means, when someone is so frustrated, is angry at someone, about someone, he goes out in the streets and screams so loud, cursing that someone in the street, until the neighbours gather around, with people standing around listening and sometimes even making fun. And then the person being cursed loses face in public. That's what "Matje" means. What's so poetic about it? She's called "roots". Oh, look! Finally! Thank God! Fantastic. What is going on? Unbelievable! Did you see that Arab, Jurek? His name is Jörg, Mama. Jörg, not Jurek. Leave him already about the food! He doesn't want it. He's so calm. - Yeah. How can he stand her? - I know. Look who's talking. You're so difficult, Noa. - Me? You're difficult. Mama's your best friend. Even your husband can't stand you. - Shut up! Shut up! It was better here before you came. He'll soon enough realise and leave her. Are you crazy? Are you crazy? You're ruining my entire life! When you end up alone like a dog, don't come running to me! Got it? See him over there? He comes here every day. Not just on Memorial Day. Every day he comes here and talks to his son's grave. Incredible, huh? Maybe he has something important to tell him. Uncle David, Jörg. Jörg, Uncle David. Did you know him? No. He died before I was born. Dudi is named after him. How did he die? - In the war. My grandma was devastated. She lost her whole family in the Holocaust. And then her son in Israel, of all places. My mother was 14. He was like an idol for her. Noa, I don't feel so good. Do you want some water? Can I have the car key? What's the matter? He forgot his... sunscreen and got burnt. I told you we should not have brought him. He wants to meet Grandma. She has totally lost it. - What's the problem? The last thing Grandma needs is a German at her bedside. How can you keep your jewellery in these little plastic bags? Oy, Mama'le! Grandma! Should I try it on? Grandma! Should I try on this necklace? Mama'le, look how beautiful it is on Noa. Grandma! I couldn't reach Dudi all day. Stop suffocating him. - Don't tell me what I should do! Don't worry. I'll be back in Berlin soon. Would you shut your mouth! - You shut it! Mama. Mama'le. Can you see me? How do you feel? Open the door. Are you hot? Do you want me to open the window? Open the door. Czernowitz is there. What? - Czernowitz. What's she saying? Czernowitz, her village in Poland! Open the door. I have to see it. Hi, one moment. Hi. - How's it going? Did you see my Grandma? - Yeah. She's murmuring, hallucinating... Yep. It's the medicine. Will it get better? That's how it is. I'm so exhausted. Are you off work soon? - I'm finishing my shift now. Do you want to come to a party tonight? Whose party? - Shahar's. Really? Does he still do it on the roof? - On Independence Day. We could go. - Yeah. Great. Sure. It'll probably be boring. Just some old school friends. Don't you want to go? - No. Only if you want to. Noa, I'd like to go home. Look! Salt! Taste it. I can't taste it. Why not? I think you were right with your dictionary. What? The dictionary. Yeah? You didn't have problems understanding the doctor. I didn't mean us. I'm talking about us. I don't even know how I should talk to you. This is just a shitty time. Everything will be fine. It's always a shitty time for one reason or another. What's wrong? What's wrong? Tell me. Tell me. Shut up, you idiot! Lunatic! - Your mother! They are all crazy here. Maybe this isn't working anymore between us. I'm not going back. You wanna go to jail? - Have you no shame? Your friends are in Gaza and you're here whining? Dudi, starting tomorrow you're taking two pills a day! Stop it already with your pills! This is all your fault. Hold on! No, Jörg, thank you. I am OK. Where is Noa? I don't know. Wait! Where are you going? Yossi, do something! - You're not going anywhere! I'm not asking you! What? You want a prize? Why are you staring at me like a golem? There are always two forces that... that drive almost all people forward. The first is the search for happiness. Everyone wants to be happy in their own way. The other is the fear of failure. Both forces lead us into the field of suffering. Because each is a dead-end street. You never get rid of fear when you constantly question yourself. And you never really find happiness when you constantly look for it. "Otstranenie" is a condition of a third kind, in which a person says... I'm not part of this competition. To me, this is neither happiness nor unhappiness. I want nothing to do with this. I'm outside of this paradigm. And I can't have that kind of fear, because I don't set lofty goals. I am an observer here, someone who is passing through to glorify the world and admire it. He's a UN soldier. Mama! My Mama. Why did she leave me? I'm no one's child anymore. I probably should have come earlier. I probably should have come right at the beginning. Tell me, about the beginning. Please. It was cold. How cold? Ice cold. And it was raining. Really nasty rain. And it was grey. Everything was grey, except for you. What was I wearing? Your red coat. When did you see me? Immediately. So why didn't you stop? Good question. Tell me more. You ran after me and yelled, "Hey you! Stop!" And then you sat on the back of my bike and said: "I have to get to the train station. I'm late!" Did you think I was crazy? I thought, "I have to get you to the station." And did you? Yes. And then? And then you didn't get on the train. Instead you waited for me on the platform. I'll pay, Noa. It's the first payment of my school fees. I can't believe she never saw her house again. What difference would it have made? NOA'LE BERLIN Mama. What is it, my little one? What, my dear girl? I miss you, Mama. What do you mean, you miss me? I'm right here. Where are you, Mama? - I'm right here, my child. My little baby. Where are you? - I'm here. It's OK, just cry. Don't leave me. You are the one who went so far away. I can't find you, Mama. Don't leave me. My little baby. Don't leave me! - I'm right here. What's going to happen, Mama? Everything will be fine. What else? It's all gonna be fine. Mama is here. You'll see, everything will turn out just fine. I'm right here. Everything will be just fine. Is that the last of them? - Just one more. Goodness me. I can't believe she's being deported like that. No one's deporting her. She's going home! But she wants to stay. - She doesn't belong here. Sweetheart. Take care of yourself. Take care of yourself. Is it filming already? - Yes. Everything I'm saying too? - Yes. What time are you leaving tomorrow? - At two. Who's taking you to the airport? - Mama. Good, good. But don't fight so much. Mama loves you. - OK. My boyfriend is picking me up in Berlin. That's nice. What do you think about me having a German boyfriend? Does he take good care of you? - Of course. May he be good and healthy. What should I say? Have some. Grandma, how many languages do you speak? At home we spoke Yiddish. At school it was Polish. Then the Russians came, so in high school we spoke Russian. And German? - Yes, that too. I picked up a bit of German in the camps. And Hebrew, of course. In which language do you feel at home? Come. Come here. Come to me. (Yiddish) May you always be well. Understand? - Yes. That's the most important thing. So what's the question? Is it still running? - Yes.
