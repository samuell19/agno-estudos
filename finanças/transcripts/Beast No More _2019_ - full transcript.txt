Can you smell? - A little spice? - Maybe. It's not Cristal, but it's all we've got. Didn't hurt, right? A little bit more? Are you smelling my hair? A little creepy, but... Oh, you got me! Toby. Oh, that one freaks me out there. Well, that'll be, uh, let's call it 82.50 Where you headed? Oh, just passing through. Passing through, eh? Not much on this road but a bunch of trees and some farms. Used to be the old highway, you know. You on holiday? Uh, work. Not taking the family? On your own? I'm meeting some people. It's easy to get lost around here. You're gonna need a map. People go missing all the time. Can I just take my change? Got something for you. I've got one on my phone. Fandangled things. Better off with the real thing, if you ask me. Let me get that for you, darlin'. See you soon, you slut! Uh, so the moth enters through the opening, passes through the one-way funnel and into the collector. It's a totally harmless catch and release. And we'll keep a few for study, of course. It's the female of the species that passes on the genetic mutation to the offspring, so hopefully we can stop a few of the male children from dying. Um, uh... ultrasound, the signal, it lowers the migration path in theory. The most important tool in the arsenal. Like honey to a moth. Base camp has been established. Got a soft bed, barbecue, workstation, no male required. Let the hunt begin. It won't be much longer. Can I grab the book? Yeah, go on. Look at the surroundings. Here. Hey! You look hot today. What? Hey, Tobes! Happy birthday, mate! Uh-huh! Your present's in the car. Come check it out. Come on. What could it be? Eh? Awesome! It's cool! It's cool. Cool. It's a soccer ball, mate. You gotta use your feet, huh? Watch. Ready? Huh? Now kick it back. Good job, Mom. Hey, you ready? Whoop! Gotta stay on your toes, buddy. I don't like this. I know, but have another go for Dad, okay? Come on, mate, at least put a bit of effort in, huh? Not bad. Now here you go. Come on, buddy! How about I go get one of the other presents? Okay. Yeah, Mom's got it down. Well, you're not listening, all right? Just put a bit into it. Ready? Watch. Well, there goes the grant budget. It looks like the pupa's been eaten straight out of the cocoon by some kind of predator. A wild dog, maybe. Eww. Stay away from the camera, Doc. Mom, come! We gotta go! Mom! Where's the food? Camp's been destroyed. Finds missing this time. Couldn't have been a roo. So it looks like I might have made a friend. Look. Opodiphthera mutantis. It's just beautiful. It's an endangered species. Just you all alone out here. Where is it? God! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! - Oh, God. - Thank God. Are you okay? What the hell are you doing here? Seriously? You're not answering your phone, and you're out here in the middle of nowhere. I was worried sick about you. I don't need your help. Running away will not solve our problems. You're pregnant. We need to take care of you. My knight in shining armor. We're worried. We? Beth's here too. Fuck. He is an asshole, but he loves you. I'm sorry he dragged you into all this. What are you doing out here? I'm working. No, you're not. You're running. I am not. Then just come home. Did Jake put you up to saying all this? I went by your house the other day. It was so quiet. Normally I'd hear Toby running around. Run over and give him a big hug. I wish I could hug him now. But I can't. Just come home. Don't you need someone too? I've got everything I need here. - You even gonna look at me? - No. Our son is dead. We need to let it go, accept it. You let it go, didn't you? Very quickly. The only reason you're out here is 'cause you don't like to lose. Well, you've lost... Yeah, mate. No, I'm out bush. Back tomorrow. So what do you think? - About MJ? - Of course. She's just mourning Toby. It's sad. This is different. She's not processing. She's... She's stuck. You think? Yeah. Maybe... Maybe you can look into it. She'll listen to you. I'll try, I'll try. You know I will. What? Oh, my God! Jake! Jake! Hey, hey, what's wrong? What is it? There was something on the roof! Okay, okay, it was a... It was just probably a possum or something, all right? Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Possum. Um, what are you doing with my gear? - You're coming home with us. - No! I need to finish this. You're pregnant. I'm gonna take care of you. Hey, we are gonna go home and sort this out. I'm not leaving without you. Can you please stop acting like you give a shit? MJ! You can't walk away every time I try to talk to you. What do you want to say? Jesus. Wait! Great! Ohh... I can't see anything. I'm telling you, I saw it. Don't look at me like that. It was right here. - What is it? - Shh. It's a shelter. What, you think food's gonna make it appear? Shh. Ridiculous. How much longer are we gonna be in here? What is it? Scared the shit out of... Hey! Oi! Get back here! Jake! - Is everything okay? - He's bleeding pretty badly. I've gotta stitch it up. We're too far from a hospital. Is he gonna die? I don't know. Don't leave me alone with that thing again. - Hey. - Oh, it's fine. Shouldn't we call the police? My phone went missing yesterday. Mine too. I thought you said it was sedated. I've given him half a bottle of ether. And then what? Hey, hey. She's still in there. You left her alone with it? He's sleeping. For now. I think I've given him the right amount this time. MJ, this isn't a puppy you can just adopt. What do you want me to do, take him out the back and put a bullet in his head? We wait until he's well enough to move, and then we'll take him to a hospital. Is it even human? I mean, look at it. What is it, exactly? Be glad you can't see it. He's just a sick boy! Hey. Hey. Here. Come on. That's okay. Come on. It's okay. It's okay. Want some of this? Mmm! Smell good? It's good. You want some more? Hmm? Shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. Shh, shh, it's okay. Good boy. When I was down the road before, I think I saw an old farm. Yeah, I saw it on the way up. I think it's abandoned. Well, if there is someone home, perhaps they can help. What do you say? I don't want leave him alone. Well, Beth can stay with him. I am not staying with that thing. Hey. I'm trying to help. Believe me. Jake, get off him! Jake, you're hurting him! Get off of him! What is wrong with you? Just a sick boy, huh? I'm sorry. I know you're scared, but I'm not gonna hurt you. Can you understand what I'm saying? I knew you could. Are you cold? It's just a blanket. There we go. Where are your parents? I'm just gonna clean this, okay? So this might sting just a little bit. There we go. Beth! They're gone! - Where? - He took her. Mary Jane! Watch your step. One more. Shit. Come on. No. We're going in circles. Oh, my... Come on. Oh, where have you guys been? Us? Where the hell were you? I just went to check the catches. - Where is it? - Where's what? - I set him free - You what? - It was cruel. - So you let it go. MJ, that thing could be out there now just watching us. He caught it himself. Let me cut these up for you. Eat some veggies too. Where are they? This fucking thing stole my keys! You fucking stole my keys! You wanna... Don't you ever touch him again! Come on. It's okay, it's okay. Calm down. Shh. Shh. Hey. He's not gonna hurt you anymore, I promise. Hey! Shush! Shush! Shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. Hey, baby, hey. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Where are you going? She stopped listening to me a long time ago. So you're just gonna abandon your child again? She's isn't herself! We can help her, but we have to get her away from that thing first. What are you suggesting? I'll take care of it, but I need you to distract MJ. No, no. You know, this isn't normal, right? I love your sister, even if she doesn't believe it. But I can't lose her or our baby. Help me. Okay, okay. The mother duck's eggs hatched. Such beautiful babies. But one of them wasn't like the others. He was different, and they called him ugly. The ugly duckling left his home and found some wild flocks of ducks and geese. But life was very hard out there, and every day was a struggle to survive. The ugly duckling watched as men hunted the other birds. But one day, he came across a family of swans, and they were so beautiful, and he wanted to join them. He flapped his little wings, but he couldn't fly. The ugly duckling spent the entire winter hiding in caves by the lake. But finally spring arrived, and the swans returned, and he approached them. He was scared. He thought they wouldn't want him. But they welcomed him with open wings. And he was shocked. He peered down into the lake and saw his reflection. He wasn't ugly. He'd grown into a beautiful swan. The ugly duckling spread his wings and flew away with his new family. Do it. Hey. Hey, what's wrong? I've lost my locket, the one that mom gave me. I think it was down by the creek, I don't know. Okay, okay. Please help me. Yeah, I have to grab a torch. - It won't take long. - Okay, okay. Here. Wait here. Are you sure it was here? Yeah. MJ! - Where is he? - He ran off. MJ! Don't go after it. Where are you?! Come back! Please! I'm sorry! Come back! Please! Please come back! Just tell me... How could you?! How could you do that?! He would've killed him! - What are you doing? - How could you do that to him?! Stop! Stop! Can't catch me! Slow down. Slow down. Jesus! I said slow down! What the hell was that? Jesus. Miss, are you all right? Hey, hey. Hey, wake up. Wait, what are you doing? We need to get this lady some help. MJ, come on. MJ! What is going on? There's a light on over there. Hopefully someone's home. - She's dead! - Who is? What about the boy? The boy? This woman needs our help! - You can look for him later! - You don't care about him! Stop pretending you never wanted him! We needed you, and you weren't there! Almost there. Beth! Beth! Jake! Hello! Is anyone home? Hello! I need some help out here. Hey, miss? Please wake up. Miss! Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Ah, fuck! Hello? Have a drink, little lamb. What? You fainted out there in the barn. Someone... Someone, they... Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. I'm sorry I frightened you. We don't see many folk out this way. Can't you city girls read? Sign out front says, "No trespassing." Look here. She's just a baby. As if she did Meg in. There's more than one of them, moron! We should be out there looking for them. What you gonna do, run them over with your stinking chair? We were just trying to get help. - W-We... - Calm down. We're just a bunch of old girls here. Drink up. Better? Now I need you to focus, little lamb. What happened to Meg? Who's Meg? You said you came here to get help. Now I presume it's for the dead woman you dumped in our barn. I-I didn't know. It was an accident. - It was an accident. - What kind kind of an accident? A car? I don't know. I didn't see. I didn't see it. Don't lie to me, little lamb. Give that back! Give it back, please! Please give that back! I don't know! Don't know, eh? We just wanna know what happened, okay? Who was there? How many people? Why won't you look me in the eye and tell me? What have you got to hide? She's got the pox. Like the young'uns. Please explain. Bad stock. Can't see nothing. Let her go. I'm sorry. Like I said, we don't get many visitors. Some of us forget our manners. What do you see? What do you see? Little lamb, you're defected. What does that mean? I'm so sorry. Get away from her! I said get away from her! Just a bunch of old girls here. Why don't you put down that reaper, and we can discuss this like civilized citizens? Or are we just a bunch of country bumpkins to you? Come on, relax. Someone in your condition should be taking it easy. How far along are you? Is the man who came with you the father? I just want my sister. My sister. Now! You killed my sister, didn't you? You killed our sister and then came here demanding yours. How dare you. Enough! Oh, shit. Hey, buddy, you okay? Have you seen two women? One's blind... Shut up. Beth! Beth! Beth, Beth. It's okay. What do you think they're gonna do to us, MJ? It's gonna be okay. I promise. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied to you. And the boy... He really was just a boy, wasn't he? And me and Jake, we treated him like an animal. Hi. - What is it? What is... - Shh, shh! Oh, good boy, good boy. Come on, come on. Hope she got your motor running. You're gonna need it. Eeeny... meeny... miney... moe! Who am I kidding? You're up, pretty boy. Get in! Fuck! Stay down! Gimme it! Gimme it! ♪ High hopes ♪ ♪ I've got high hopes ♪ ♪ She's got high hopes ♪ Quit it with the tunes! Ugh! Oh, fuck me. Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus has got nothing to do with this place. Where's my wife? Maybe you can clear this up for me. Who killed our sister Meg? It was an accident, all right? We were coming here for help. So I was right. It was the woman. She didn't mean to. Her... We just lost our son. All Father wanted was a son. All right, lady, I don't care what's going on here. I promise you if you let us go, we will not tell anyone. Was your boy healthy? Yes, of course. Was he blind? What? Your wife has a blind sister. Was your boy blind? No. So despite a defective gene pool, you fathered a normal boy. How did he die? Where's my fucking wife? How did he die? It was a car accident, okay? It was car accident, just like your sister. You lost your boy. That must've killed you. Please, just... tell me. Is my wife... All Father wanted was a male heir. But he kept churning out girls. Useless girls. We promised him a boy. But Father was defective. And so are we. Do you know what it's like to let down someone who needs you? To make promises you can't keep? I never wanted my son. I never wanted my beautiful little boy. I wasn't ready. Drink. Get ready. Father's still waiting. There's a track winding back from his asshole to his crack. Are you still creeping round here, boy? You are a stain on your good father's name! Oh, shit. You little shit. Come here. Feel this? Untie him. Beth! Step one, two, three. Wait! There's others. Other men. - Jake... - Come on. Okay, watch your head. Shit. Hurry. You're free. Come on! Come on. - Jake, come on, let's go. - Fuck. - Shit! - I'm sorry! That's okay. It's not your fault. - Okay, go. - I'll get... Go to the car. The boy will help me. It's not your fault, okay? Go. Go. The boy will help. Go! Hey, you just go straight ahead. I'm right behind you, okay?
