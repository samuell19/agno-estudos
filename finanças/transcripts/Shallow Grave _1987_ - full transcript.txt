(typewriter clicking) (heels clacking) (door closing) Ladies, since you arrived at this university there has been no rest for me. If it wasn't the last day before vacation, I would be forced to do something drastic. Like revoke all weekend passes. I understand the four of you intend to spend your vacation taking care of. Miss Spencer's invalid grandmother. Yes, Sister. Grandma's looking forward to us coming down and spending time with her in Florida. Fine. I'd like the four of you to do me a little favor while you're down there. No problem, Sister. You just name it. Good. I'd like each of you to write a 100 page report on the teachings of Saint Paul. A hundred pages? Jesus Christ. I mean... was that Saint Paul you said, Sister? That's correct. Perhaps through his teachings, you will learn the true spirit of this university and stop trying to make fools of everybody else! You may leave now. (lawnmower humming in the distance) By the way, where does your grandmother live? Fort Lauderdale Beach. Fort Lauderdale Beach? (uptempo rock'n'roll music) We're out of here!

This place is prehistoric. Just look at these characters. They're probably rapists in there. They'll at least undress us with their eyes. Don't be ridiculous. We're four able-bodied girls.

They're probably rapist. Or undress us with their eyes." (laughing) Who's undressing who now, Sue Ellen? So, I was wrong, I admit it. Two barbecue pork sandwiches and two Cokes to go. You made a good choice. Now I'll take it from here. Michigan! Doesn't that have something to do with a wolf? It's wolverines, sweetheart. I knew it was something like that. Why don't you guys just sit down and tell us all about it? So what school are you girls from? Our Lady of Hearts. What makes you think we're still in school? We may have graduated already. No way. Number one, she just gave us the name of the school and number two, she's reading what looks like a second year lit book. It's a fourth year lit book. You probably haven't gotten to that reading level yet. Paradise Lost. It's not a sex book. Tell me, do you think it's better to rule in Hell than to serve in Heaven? In Michigan, it's a second year lit book. So, are you guys heading to Florida? Hell yeah, man! We're going to Fort Lauderdale for one solid week of partying. How about you? We're going to visit my invalid grandmother. (all giggling) It's a long story. [Chad] So, where you guys staying at? We have a house. [Both] A house? Hey, you got any more room in this house - for a couple of more people? - You mean you don't have a place to stay? We have a room. If we sleep on the floor. Hey, we're really not bad guys. I'm Owen Grant and this is Chad Bolton. Two of the nicest guys to ever come out of Michigan. This is Sue Ellen, Patty, Cindy, and I'm Rose. The only one you're have to remember. I have a great idea. Why don't we all drive down together? You know, like a caravan? It could be fun. Sounds good to me. Uh-uh, Chad. Aren't you forgetting something? My sister. [Chad] Oh, that's right. I promised her we'd stop at her house on the way down, and she'll kill me if I don't show up. Oh, well. [Waitress] Forty-two, forty-six? Oh, that's us. Hey, I have an idea. How about breakfast tomorrow? - Breakfast. - Yeah. There's this great little truck stop just outside Florida. Steak and Eggs of Life, man! [Chad] We'll even make it our treat. Okay! You're on. Wait a minute, how do we know you'll show up tomorrow? Do we look like the kind of girls who would lie to you? Nice, Catholic girls like us? Excuse me. (door creaking) Weak kidneys. Seriously though, how do we know you'll be there? I think it's called trust. I don't believe in trust. But I do believe in taking hostages. Hey, I need that. I'll give it back. Tomorrow at breakfast. We'll compare notes on it, then. [Waitress] Fifty-one? [Owen] That's us. Thanks. [Sue Ellen] You guys leaving already? Yeah, we gotta get to my sister's before it gets too late. How's nine o'clock for tomorrow sound? Nine o'clock sounds great. Yeah? Okay. - Bye. - See you there. Bye. Bye. (whistling) I think I'm in lust. I know I'm in lust.

(all laughing) How did you get that? ♪ Georgia ♪ ♪ 11-55 alive ♪ - [Radio Broadcaster] - Welcome to Medley, Georgia. Six a.m. and a beautiful morning. Start out a great day. I'm Smiling Slim Wymon here until 11:30, when we bring in Fat Jack Kragen. Later on, we're gonna be talking to William Gump, an expert on backwoods survival. First, let's look at our community calendar. Burdock Falls is holding their annual hog roast and pie bake-off. It will be as much fun as it will be tasty. Kennard Grange meeting tonight at seven. Community drum auditions will be held on Perkins Field this evening starting around five o'clock. Oh, don't forget the King's Creek High School potluck Saturday. Plan ahead for that one. Let's see... [Gump] You know, survival in the woods is not just picking some berries, you know? A good meal in the woods requires knowledge. Certain insects can be eaten pound for pound. Forget it. I'd rather piss in the woods than that place. Well, my bladder is not that picky. (men cheering) Don't shoot your nuts off, boys. That'll be $12, ma'am. What was that all about? Oh, well, today's the first day of hunting season. Some of the boys are out having some fun today. Say, where are you ladies headed for, anyway? We're going to Fort Lauderdale. No shit. I was there once and boy, that there water sure was nice. Yeah, and if we don't get there soon, it'll be too dark to see that there water. (car engine revving) You take care and happy hunting! (laughing) Hey, hey, hey! (sighing) How could you have talked to him? He gave me the creeps. I didn't think any male could give you the creeps. What is all this crap? What are we gonna do about writing this essay? Don't worry about it. Why do they have to preach to us on Saturday, also? I'm not worried about it. Yeah, well you're the one who got us the writing assignment. Hey, chill out. We all agreed to pull that joke on her together. It's just that Sue Ellen thought of it. It was a moment of brilliance. Then maybe the brilliant one should write it. Actually, I thought you would be the one to write it for all of us. How much? Fifty cents a page. A dollar fifty a page! A dollar a page. You're on. (laughing) What's so funny about a business agreement? Nothing, it's just that she's doing it for us for 50 cents a page. (all cheering) (tire popping) (tires screeching) Shit! (light rock music) I've never been more scared in my life. (birds chirping) Great. I have a feeling that not too many people use this road. It looks like we may have to do this ourselves. Anybody got any muscles? What's wrong with you guys? Didn't your father ever teach you how to fix a flat? My father never even showed me where they kept the flat fixer. It's called a spare tire. Whatever. I could never do it. Yeah, my nails would never handle it. Well, then I guess you're lucky that I came along. (trunk clicks open) (sighing) Rose? Where's the spare tire? What's a pair of tires? The other tire that was back here. Oh, that. There's no way I could fit all that luggage in with that stupid tire. While you guys get the flat fixer, I have got to go to the bathroom. Where do I go? I know exactly where to send her. Listen, just walk in that direction as far as you wanna go and drop your pants and do your thing. (rustling) But those are woods! I need a cigarette. [Radio Announcer] In fact, all of northern Florida is experiencing one beautiful - - You gotta couple of bucks? You expect me to function this early? My brain is still asleep. My stomach's wide awake. Do you want anything or what? Whatever you get, I'll split it with you. Take it easy on the food. We gotta meet those girls soon. "I took your money to ensure you're showing up for breakfast. Sue Ellen." Oh, Jesus. The breakfast of champions. You gotta be kidding. I need a cigarette. (birds chirping) Excuse me, but do you really expect me to go in there? I mean, there might be snakes or something. I need a cigarette. This is getting worse by the second. I'm going back to the gas station. It's about a mile. You can take care of the two princesses. (rustling) (nature sounds) (fabric rustling) (urinating) (woman giggling) (woman moaning) (kissing and moaning) [Woman] What are you doing? Time to get back. Oh, come on. Why do we always have to do what you wanna do? Stay awhile. No. Come on, or I'll be late. You're about as romantic as a dead fish. Come on, let's do it again. I haven't seen you in awhile. There's not time. There's never any time for us. If you left your wife, we would have all the time in the world. I do the best I can. You do the best you can? Bullshit. It's not good enough. (foreboding music) You're still in love with your wife, aren't you? Answer me, goddamn it. You still love your wife, don't you? Goddamn liar. You were never gonna ask your wife for a divorce, were you? Were you? I'll tell her everything. Everything! Just get your things and let's get the hell out of here. Two years. Two years you've been telling me that you were gonna get a divorce. You were gonna take me away from this stinking place. All the time, you've been leading me on. Lying to me. I'm gonna tell your wife everything. Everything. You just keep your mouth shut! I am gonna destroy you! Your nice little family, your precious little nothing job. No you're not! Now get in the car! Oh, I want her to know. I want everyone to know just what kind of son of a bitch... You just keep your fucking mouth shut! Not a goddamn thing you can do to stop me! (intense music) (neck snapping) (birds chirping) (twig cracking) (giggling) I think Sue Ellen is planning a wild time in Fort Lauderdale. And you know, we will never hear the end of it. You know, she's been taking a long time. Maybe she had a lot to do. (laughing) (birds chirping) (footsteps thudding) (thud) (sobbing) (rustling) (foreboding music) (birds chirping) (knocking on door) Hello? (knocking on door) Hello?! Shit. (panting) (car seat creaking) (intense, foreboding music) This is bullshit. Do you think she's lost? (giggling) No. She's probably playing one of her stupid jokes. I swear, she can be so adolescent sometimes. Well, if she is lost, I hope she finds a pack of cigarettes out there for me. (both laughing) Come on. Let's go and find her. But if this is a joke, I am going to Kill her. (ominous music) (shoveling) Hey, excuse me! Excuse me, but do you have a cigarette? We've got a flat tire up on the road and believe it or not, we don't have a spare tire. I'm sorry, but do you have a cigarette? You see, we kinda need a little help. We're kind of a little lost, also. (eerie music) I mean, as far as how to get back to the road. (gun cocking) She's dead! (gun firing) (both screaming) (intense music) (gun firing) (eerie music) (gasping) (rustling) (breathing heavily) (rustling) (eerie music) (footsteps thudding) (gasping) (eerie music) Rose? Cindy? Where are you guys? (sobbing) Please. Where are you? (dramatic music) We've gotta find help. What? He killed her. What, what happened? I saw this man. I saw him kill a woman. She was gonna tell about them and then he killed her. All right, all right. Calm down. Where is Cindy and Rose? I don't know. I came out of the woods and they were gone. Oh my God. Maybe they went to look for me. Maybe he's got them. No. No, he doesn't. Look, let's you and I go back to the gas station. Maybe we can get the police. Come on, I'll help you. (gasping) (sobbing) (car door slams) (thud) (crying) Patty! Patty, Sue Ellen, help me! You guys. (foreboding music) Help. (gasping) (horn honking) (intense music) (Cindy gagging) (somber music) Did you see anything else about him? They were naked. Hell, he'd just finished screwing her. Did you see anything? I didn't see anything about size, if that's what you mean. No, forget it. I think he had dark hair. What do you mean, you think? Well, he had hair. (intense, brooding music) (dogs barking) They're late. Yeah, no shit. You think we can order now, before I die of malnutrition? You think their car broke down or something? Is it that hard for you to admit that maybe, just maybe, you're being stood up? Face it, buddy, even studs like you get the shaft at least once in their life. I think you finally got yours. You know, you're probably right. But if you are, it'll be the first time in your life. Besides, she's got my money and stuff. Come on. Wait a minute. I don't believe this. Are we gonna do what I think we're gonna do? You rest here. I'll go take a look around. (eerie music) (phone ringing) Hey, there's a phone in here! (water dripping) (phone ringing) (glass shattering) Don't! (dog barking) (screaming) (dog growling) (glass shattering) (dog snarling) (crying) Oh... (ominous music) (sobbing) (car rumbling) Y'all better have a good excuse because if you don't, you're going to jail. [Patty] But we didn't do anything. I'd day breaking and entering is enough. But we didn't enter any place. That's because a dog stopped you. Look, we're innocent, but there is a killer out there somewhere. That's got to be one of the wildest stories I ever heard. A man murdered a woman and you saw everything? Not everything. Look, our friends are missing. At least you could be looking for them. How do I know there were two other girls along with you? (police radio chattering) Gas station attendant. He saw us, he can tell you. That's right. The attendant. Already tried to reach him. He won't be back 'til tomorrow night. You got any other ideas? I can't believe this yokel town. A man kills somebody, our two friends are in danger out in the woods, and the Lone Ranger won't do shit about it. Well, maybe you sit your ass in the Lone Ranger's jail for awhile. Your shit head attitude might change. [Dean] Forty-one to central, over. Forty-one, this is central, over. [Dean] Yeah, Scott, I'm over at that car on the side of the road. Well, those girls are right about one thing. They did have a flat. I'm gonna have that car towed into town. Going to have a little talk with those two. Roger, Dean, we'll see you in awhile. Central out. Ladies, your accommodations await. What about our friends? If you had such friends, they're probably walking back into town right now. Just like you two did. Look, her hand needs to be taken care of, we're filthy, and don't we get to make a phone call? I'll re-bandage your hand, you can all clean up in the bathroom and you can make a call as soon as the sheriff gets back. Now this way, ladies, if you please? (trunk unlocking) "Ronda Dasher is the biggest whore in this county.” "No, your mother is, asshole.” The creative literature on these walls is incredible. [Patty] Maybe we could've gotten one of them to write our essays. Yeah, and probably for a dime a page. (laughing) [Patty] I'm worried about Cindy and Rose. With this deputy sheriff, the chances of help for them are slim to none. [Patty] I hope that nothing's happened to them. I just wish this whole thing were over with and we were gone from this town. Hey, when do we get our phone call? [Patty] Who are you gonna call? Your folks are in New York. [Patty] Mine, they probably won't waste the time to come here. Think Sister Mac will take a collect call from us? [Patty] Probably from anybody but us. We've gotta get out of here. We're gotta get out of this stinking place. (menacing music) [Sports Announcer] Over the second baseman's head... [Indecipherable] Hey, Dean! You sure did get back fast. They back there? Well, I wasn't gonna let them prance around. I mean, I could have. They do look mighty fine. Them little darlings got one hell of a story to tell you. I mean, they say they even saw a murder. Murder, huh? You think they might have seen one? Could be. Hey, why don't you check around? See if everyone's where they're supposed to be. I'll be talking to the ladies. Goddamn it, Dean. It's a good thing we got such a smart sheriff. (footsteps approaching) (indecipherable radio chatter) Ladies. I hear we have a story to tell today. Which one of you saw this murder? I did. Well, what'd you see? I saw a man and a woman arguing. I mean, they were really yelling at each other. He threw her down on the ground and then he strangled her. Can you describe him? No. They were too far away. I really couldn't see his face. What about the woman? I couldn't see her, either. You have to look at this from my point of view. You were caught breaking into a local business establishment, you claim to have two missing friends and you're claiming to have witnessed a murder. But you are lawbreakers. And that makes you sound damned unreliable. See, we go on facts in this town. Not wild stories. So, can you give me some facts? The trunk. [Dean] What? The trunk of the car. Our luggage is in the trunk of the car. That'll prove that there were four of us. (radio announcer chattering indistinctly) L.Q. Anybody been near this car since you brought it in? Nah, no one. I ain't never seen a soul all day, except for you and these pretty darlings. Hell, you never do see nobody around here when it's hunting season. You should know that, Dean. Well, we're gonna need to check out the trunk. Sure. No problem. [Radio Sports Announcer] Strike one, right across the middle.

Dean, I'm sorry, but they really ain't that bad. Let me tell you something. You don't know anything about those two in there. You caught them trying to break into a gas station. They say they saw a murder. Well, maybe they committed a murder? You're lucky. They could've killed you instead. Did you find anything out about Angie? Yeah. She left town. The place was empty. She took everything she had. Probably ran off with some truck driver. Some drifter. There's no future in that gal. There never was. If you need me, I'll be at home getting something to eat. You just be careful with those two in there. Be damned careful. (dog sniffing) Gus! Dog, where the hell did you go? Damn dog. There you are. What you got there, boy? (eerie music) Are you sure?

Dean, I'm here, over. [Dean] Listen carefully, those two girls got away. They escaped. I want you to get some men and meet me at Willow Junction. They're headed that way. Dean, I don't think we should leave this place. I mean, just wait until you see what happened here. Them girls were right. I got three dead bodies here and Angie's one of them. [Dean] Dammit, do as you're told. But Dean! [Dean] Those girls are probably the ones that murdered Angie. Just meet me at Willow Junction. (intense, suspenseful music) (gun firing) (girls screaming) (siren wailing) Thank God, it's you! Please, you have to help us. The sheriff, he's the one that killed that woman. I'm warning you, don't move. I saw the bodies of Angie and those two girls you murdered. Oh God! They are dead. (shotgun cocking) Dean! (suspenseful music) Kill her if she tries to escape again. I've got her now, sheriff. I've got here now, Dean. You go on after the other one. I'll take this one back to her cell. (intense music) Sheriff. (menacing music) You make sure she stays locked up this time. He's the one. Sue Ellen recognized him. He's the one that murdered that woman and my two friends. Dammit, listen to me! You just be quiet. Just keep your mouth shut! (car engine rumbling) Careful with her now, boys. (birds chirping) Deputy must've dropped it... [Patty] Please, you've got to believe me! He murdered those people. I've known Dean all my life. He could never do nothing like that. Sue Ellen saw him! Look at these. Does a man who wins all these awards and commendations go out and become a murderer? Please, you've got to believe me. She saw him kill that woman! I think if anybody's under suspicion for murder, it's you and your friend. Why? Why would we have killed that woman? We didn't even know her. Well, then why did you two run then? What were we supposed to do? Let him come in and kill us while you weren't around? Now, how in the hell is he gonna kill you in a jailhouse? No, sweetheart, Dean ain't your Killer. Please, you've gotta believe me. (panting) (quiet, foreboding music) (barn door sliding) (bird cooing) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (crying) All right. I want all you men to stay here. I'm going back to the jailhouse. See about getting some more help. You be real careful of this little tramp. She's already murdered three people. I don't want any of you risking your lives. So I'm authorizing you, I'm ordering you, shoot her on sight. (guns cocking) (ominous music) Scott? Yeah, Dean? [Dean] I want you to get on down here and head up the search party. Where you gonna be? [Dean] You just get your ass down here. I'm headed back to the office. You can reach me there if you need me. [Patty] Why? Why would we have killed that woman?

[Radio Preacher] In a world of doubt and insecurity, answer the question: "Is my life worthy to be led in the name of Jesus?" I believe many of us have no vision to guide our future. To guide us into spiritual communion with God. To heal and comfort. We feel guilty. We are filled with lost hope and spiritual sickness. In our distress, we cry unto the Lord, "I am nothing more than crazy, unfortunate, the distressed, the dying. [, who am rich in worldly goods, youth and beauty, have failed to glorify the Lord.” Cry out! He will hear you. Cry out with all your soul. Cry out to him with everything that is within you and then he will hear you. I promise you this, God will deliver you. God will answer... Take off your clothes. [Radio Preacher] God will set you free if you live right. You are lost in your situation only when you are lost from the path of Jesus. God is the sustainer of life. God will provide a life... I said, take off your clothes. [Radio Preacher] In the blood of Jesus, he will hear you. Love him! Don't hurt me. [Radio Preacher] With all your heart and soul and you shall be delivered from your torment. He who eats the flesh of the Son of God will have salvation. Stand firm and open to his word. Let yourself be touched... Please, don't. [Radio Preacher]... key to the spiritual host. The host of spiritual wickedness would lead you from the loving path of righteousness. They would further your pain by telling you that your hope and salvation lies in the pleasures of the material world and the pleasures of the flesh. Be not misguided. Only when you open yourself to God will the devil begin the battle for your soul, for Satan is jealous. Satan is jealous of your righteousness. Satan is only a creature. He would taunt you with temptations of wickedness. He would make you think that your happiness lies in wealth, comfort and sensuous pleasure. [Radio Announcer] Amen! [Radio Preacher] You would seek relief in the sinful ways of most satisfaction. Jezebel did the same until she was redeemed by Jesus Christ. Jezebel was delivered from her sin and spiritual suffering by Jesus. If you are in spiritual pain, do not seek these easy ways of sinful and false reconciliation. If you are desperate, cry out to the Lord. If you are soul hurt, cry out to the Lord. Cry out! "I'll pay the price, my Lord! 'I pay with my life!” Wash clean in the blood of the lamb. There is no other way. Salvation awaits, I promise you this. The only power is the power of the Holy Ghost. Not my words, not my beauty. Power, authority, personality, money, knowledge, degrees and the world, but the power of the Holy Ghost who lives in me! Redeem through the power of our Lord, Jesus Christ! Say, Amen! [Congregation] Amen! (birds chirping) You guys go right. Cover the barn area. (dog barking) (rustling) (eerie music) (water flowing and splashing) (sink turning off) [Chad] Hello? Nice town, even the local cops are gone. I swear, this is like an episode of "The Twilight Zone." (humming "The Twilight Zone" theme) Hello? Hey, maybe there's someone locked up in there who can tell us what's going on. Hey! (menacing music) What the hell are you doing? [Chad] Sorry, Sheriff. We called out, but no one answered. What do you want? We're looking for some girls. This isn't a whore house, boy. No, Sheriff, you don't understand. We were supposed to meet some girls down the highway a bit and they never showed up. We thought maybe their car broke down or something. When was this place built, 1600? Get your ass over here with your friend. Look, I haven't seen any girls. So, if you don't mind, I've got a lot of work to do. Help yourselves out the door. Yeah, thanks. Sorry to have bothered you. (foreboding music) (rustling) (gun firing) Stop! There ain't no place to go! (guns firing) (Sue Ellen screaming) No, stop firing! Hold your fire! (Sue Ellen crying) Please, don't shoot me! I didn't do anything! I only saw him kill a woman! Calm down, you'll be all right. Call an ambulance! (Sue Ellen crying) (foreboding music) ♪ Signed, sealed, and delivered ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ You just might find ♪ (siren wailing) ♪ Taken, not given ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ Oh, tonight ♪ ♪ Oh, tonight ♪ I swear it was him. I saw him doing it. He strangled her! Get him away from me! He's gonna kill me, just like he killed Cindy and Rose! (crying) Good job, Scott. You did a good job. Where's the other girl? She's in the jail cell, where you left her. Hell of a day, huh? Can't talk right now. Well, I got something of yours. (ominous music) Something just doesn't add up. I mean, them girls would have no reason to kill Angie. Look Scott, do me a favor. You take care of things here. I'm going to ride with her, just in case she decides to make a confession. (foreboding music) You dropped this back at the grave site. What're you talking about? This wallet thing. You left it at the grave site. I don't have one of them things. That belongs to Dean. I guess the sheriff must've dropped it. (foreboding music) (siren wailing) (suspenseful music) (intense music)
