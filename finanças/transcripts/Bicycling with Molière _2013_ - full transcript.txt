At last! I'll trust you. You'll notice that I got you 10% more than the previous season. 10% that you'll soon have off me. Where are you going? I don't want to say. - Why not? - None of your business. - You're hiding something? - Absolutely! - Don't forget dinner tomorrow. - What dinner? Come on, I've already canceled twice. The head of programming will be there, the whole lot. You must come. OK, calm down. I'll get a train at 5 and be there. Promise? Don't forget. I'm a professional. Hurry up, the train's leaving. Cycling with Moli?re 2 days without a fare. The low season is hard. What with the rain... You're lucky today, it's brightened up. Lovely sunlight, no? It's our microclimate. I love "Dr Morange". I never miss an episode. You're my mom's favorite actor. She broke her hip 10 days ago. - She can't move. - The hip, of course... She's out now. She just has to do physiotherapy. But the waiting list is long, it'll be a year. - Where does she live? - Pessac, near Bordeaux. That's great, I know Professor Delahaye, head of physio at Bordeaux hospital. Let's call him. Your mother's name? Denise Baker. Like a baker. Voicemail. Hello Robert, it's Gauthier Valence. I have a favor to ask. Here we are. Thanks, bye. Thanks for my mom. Anyone home? Change the septic tank? You must change the pipes at least, they're crumbling. No wonder it stinks. - It's going everywhere. - How much will it cost? I'll do a quote, but I'd say around 5,000 euros. 5,000 euros? To change 3 pipes? I told your uncle to do it 10 years ago. You should scrap that and connect to the mains. The stench is awful. What a mess... What are you doing here? I was passing, I thought I'd call in, Serge. You were passing? On the Ile de R?? I have cousins in La Rochelle. Cousins in La Rochelle? Yes. Remember, I called you a month back? On the cellphone? Yes, I think so. I've only got a landline now. On the landline, then. You hung up cos you had boiler problems. What do we do about the tank? Close it, I can't decide. You should get connected. I don't like being connected, I like being independent. Close it up, sorry. This house is a nightmare. All the plumbing needs doing. It'll cost millions. Something to drink? You want a vodka? A coffee? I'd love a tea. I'm not sure if I've got tea. How did you get this house? I had an uncle who lived here with his cats. Us 10 nephews weren't interested in him. I always sent him a Christmas card. One day I got a call from the notary. He'd left me his house. Unbelievable. What's that look for? What did you expect, a house with white floorboards? Not at all, I like it. It... It has charm. At first I wanted to sell it. The island realtors offered me a fortune. Then when I stopped working, I moved in, temporarily... - 3 years ago. - You took up painting? I've no such pretentions. I do still lives. Well, I enlarge photos. I find it relaxing. The days aren't easy. When did we last see each other? 5, 6 years ago? 6 years. On the shoot in Hungary, remember? The director went berserk. Yes, and that English actress didn't want to show her tits. And that fat guy who fell off his horse! Wasn't that where there was a terrible storm? It was terrifying. We always dined together and you talked to me about Moli?re. I've followed your career, you've had a lot of hits. It's extraordinary, remarkable... It's funny, I don't know why, but lately I've been wondering what had become of you. As you can see, I'm fine. Then I remembered our conversations, and I thought maybe I could offer Serge something. - Not acting, I hope. - Well, yes, in fact. Save your breath. My film days are over. Even if Spielberg offered me a script. Look, they go on the fire. I'm not talking cinema. I'm talking about a play. A play? Yes. I'm offering you a play. You mean a role in a play? Obviously. A role in a play. You're out of your mind. I haven't been on stage in years. All that's behind me now. Let me tell you which play. I don't want to know the name of the play. I told you. Theater, cinema, I'm done. It's a dirty business, with vulgar people who lie and betray. No way. There are still some decent people. Who, for example? Name one. Me. I'm decent. You? Well let's say you're the exception. You didn't come just to talk about that? Oh, no, I knew very well what you'd say. I was just wondering... You know Agn?s and I divorced? I didn't know. I met someone else, quite a while ago. A wonderful woman called Christine. - Your new wife? - No, we're not married. Your new partner, then. Yes. Christine used to come to the Ile de R? as a child. She has fond memories. So I thought maybe I could find a place to rent here. You want to rent a house? That's right. And perhaps, you never know, if there was a good opportunity, I'd maybe buy something. Seriously? You want to buy a house? Exactly. I've never had my own place. I'll call Meynard. I know a great realtor. A bit of an idiot, but... Wait, there's no rush. Meynard? I've got a friend here. It's Serge. I'm with a friend who's looking to buy a house. We're here for the visit. The prices are insane. That's the Ile de R?. Nothing under a million euros. Oh no, you can still find bargains. I love "Dr Morange", I never miss it. And that film with the monkey, my wife and I were in stitches. Who's Dr Morange? It's a series I do on TF1. About a brain surgeon. A guy who can operate in a blizzard with a plastic knife and still save the girl. My mom loved the one in the Sahara. Snowstorm, sandstorm, you get the idea. OK, I've got the keys. The sellers are in a corner. They're fighting over the will, classic stuff. Obviously, you'd have to rip it all out. That would have to go. And that, and that. I've got some guys who work really well. You'd have a lovely room. It's not too damp. You won't find better. Shall we go upstairs? You have to imagine the work's done, then you'll have space. Why buy an old house and rip it all out? How's the roof? That's often where the problem is. Fully re-done. True, right now it's depressing. It's raining, the ugly wallpaper... You have to think white floorboards, stripped walls. - Sublime. - It's bottom-end. - That's a bit harsh. - I say it's low-end. He's hard to please. There's no fooling Mr Tanneur. I've got another house at Les Portes, a real gem. Can we visit it now? I have to call the owner. Just out of curiosity, what was the play you're offering me? "The Misanthrope". You're staging "The Misanthrope"? I have the theater, a producer, and I start casting in 2 weeks. "The Misanthrope". No less. For your first play? I've always dreamed of performing it. And you're offering me Alceste. Well, you remember our chats in Hungary? You said Alceste thinks he can change people. By telling them the truth, he can shift their views. In fact, he's an optimist. I don't get your meaning. You used to say that Philinte is the real pessimist. He knows it's no use battling society, that one must just accept its rules. So what? So I wanted to offer you the role of Philinte. Me, play Philinte? Yes, Philinte. What's the problem? I don't set foot on stage for 3 years, then you show up and offer me Philinte. That's gutsy. You said he's the play's great role. It's a great role, but secondary. He has 5 scenes. The meaty role is Alceste, the most complex in classical French theater. Your first Moli?re, your first play, and you take Alceste. How else would I get the role? Even Jouvet wasn't ready for Alceste. In 30 years of acting... Oh, what's the point? Wait a second! Listen. What is it now? - What if we alternate? - I don't understand. One week you'd play Alceste and I'd play Philinte. The next, we'd switch. It'd be a first. Have you gone nuts? We swap roles and everybody's happy. That's absurd. You don't get it, I no longer act. The owner's expecting us. I'm going back to Paris. Aren't we going to see the house? Another time. Come on, let's go see it. Could you take me back to Mr Tanneur's to get my case? And after 5.47pm, is there another? 8.12pm, departure... Arriving? 11.38pm in Paris, fine. Thank you, bye. I can get the last train. Stay for dinner, we've hardly spoken. I shouldn't have come. What is it? What's the matter? Nothing's the matter. What is it? What's the matter? Leave me, pray. What strange humor is this? Leave me, I say. Out of my sight Can't you listen, without anger? I want to be angry... I want to be angry, and I will not listen I cannot understand your bursts of temper And though we're friends, I'm first... I cannot understand your bursts of temper And though we're friends, I'm first I, your friend? Strike that I may have been so until now But after what you just did, I am no longer I want no place in rotten hearts Am I so guilty, Alceste? Heavens, you should die for shame, 'Tis inexcusable That's good, you know it well. I've worked on it for a while. 30 years, in my case. Listen, I'm not saying I'll do it. Here's my suggestion: Come back tomorrow, we'll read it off the cuff, and we'll see how it goes. OK? Tomorrow? Why, you got plans? No, but I wanted to leave late morning. Plus I've got a crazy week in Paris. There's something I don't get. You come to see me for "The Misanthrope", I say we'll do it, you say you're busy? - No, but... - But what? You're right. I'll make 3 calls, then I can stay. OK, where will you sleep tonight? I booked at Le Clocher. Forget it, I'll put you up. - You can have the guest room. - The guest room? Usually I don't heat it, but for you, I will. The size of this house makes heating a nightmare. Here. I'll tidy this up in 5 minutes, and it'll be fit for a king. It's very kind, but I'd prefer the hotel. See you tomorrow, then. I'm staying on the Ile de R?. Just find an excuse. But you promised me. How's that going to make me look? Listen, I'm trying to put on a play. Serge wants to rehearse. I can't say no. I'll keep you posted. Do you want dinner? We close at 9. I'll just take my bag up. We'll take care of it. Zo?! A guest in room 12. Be right there. It's fine, I'll do it. No, it's her job. The young have to learn, too. Good evening. Room 12. May I offer you an aperitif? With pleasure. Pineau des Charentes? Why not? From the Ile de R?. - How shall we do it? - Here, you do the honors. We're tossing a coin? Sure, that's easiest. Tales I'm Alceste, heads it's you. If you insist. You're Alceste. I'll have my euro back. Sorry. What is it? What's the matter? Leave me, pray What strange humor is this? Leave me, I say. Out of my sight Can't you listen, without anger? I want to be angry, and... Can we start over? What is it? What's the matter? Leave me, pray What strange humor is this? Leave me, I say. Out of my sight Can't you listen, without anger? I want to be angry, and I will not listen I cannot understand... No, I'm way off. What is it? What's the matter? Leave me, pray What strange humor is this? Leave me, I say. Out of my sight Can't you listen, without anger? I want to be angry, and I will not listen I cannot understand your bursts of temper And though we're friends, I'm first I, your friend? Strike that I may have been so until now But after what you just did I am no longer I want no place in rotten hearts Am I so guilty, Alceste? Heavens! Sorry, "heavens" shouldn't be shouted. Am I so guilty, Alceste? Heavens, you should... Wait, sorry. Am I so guilty, Alceste? Heavens, you should die for shame 'Tis inexcusable Men of honor would be scandalized You greet a man with warm embrace Profess to him utmost tenderness Vow to him your support Overloading it with zeal And when I ask who he is You can barely remember his name Your... This is all wrong! - Why? - It's awful! No, it's good. It's all wrong. - It was all forced. - No, it's a good start. You think? That's exactly what notto do. It was powerful. Shouting isn't power. I couldn't get any feeling. Alceste is no tortured revolutionary. He's not Che. Alceste is suffering. Yes, but he has a comic side. You have to bring out that aspect. Neither of us are the right age. Roles have no age. Being 20 in those days... I'm rusty, I haven't acted for 3 years. I remember your "Tartuffe" at Chaillot, magnificent! - You saw that? - You bet. Your scene with Elmire was great. I had goose bumps. You know her? Yes, she's Italian. Disagreeable, hardly says hello. Thank you. I don't get why you're here. The first time we met was on "Beaumarchais". I had a big scene, terrible nerves. The director kept yelling, I was going to pieces. You took me aside, helped me with the lines. When I came back on set, I did it in one take. I did that? You did. What use is a man's embrace His sworn friendship, zeal, esteem and love His praise to your face If he does the same to any old wretch? No self-respecting man can ever accept esteem that's so prostituted The best honor has no charm If given to all the universe alike Esteem must show some preference You may as well love none, as everyone Since you fall for these vices My God, you're not my kind of fellow I refuse to share in the fellowship That makes for merit no distinction I want to be distinguished. To put it bluntly The friend of Man's no friend to me What do you think? Magnificent. It's all in there. You nailed it. You got the restrained anger. That's what Alceste is all about, restrained anger. It's worth giving it a shot, don't you think? I like your Philinte. Not argumentative, that's good. That really whetted my appetite. So then, what do you think? You'll do it? I could say yes... But I'll say no. Why? Give me one good reason? I don't want to go back. I just don't want to act anymore. But you're amazing! You come out of the garage after 3 years, you start first time. You're a Rolls Royce! Is that how you see me? This "Misanthrope" could be a huge triumph. Acting's over for me. You're all fired up by success, but I've lost the spark. So I just go back, leave you here? Hold on, you're so impatient. We're not in a rush. Here's the deal: There's 4 days till the weekend. We rehearse those 4 days, then see where we're at. If it's good, we do it. If not, we don't. Let's be merciful to human nature Not judge it with utmost rigor A little dessert? Home-made rice pudding? I won't, thank you. I've turned the heating up in the rooms. Thank you. I just have to say, I love you in "Dr Morange". You learn lots about the brain, it's very instructive. Thank you very much. My favorite episode is with the Chinese girl who's lost her memory, but you operate and she gets it back. It brought a tear to my eye. Beautiful. But I'm interrupting you. Not at all, Madame Bichet. You know my niece Zo?, who works here? She wants to act. A wonderful vocation. It's a splendid profession. But what Zo? wants to do is act in porn films. - Porn films? - My sister's not against it. Lots of nice girls do it these days. She's worked on 4 or 5 films and earns good money. Her boyfriend doesn't mind, so... So... Could you spare her 5 minutes? I'd really appreciate it. Well, I'm not sure how I could help. But I'd be happy to try. That's very kind. Thank you. Like you, I see a hundred things each day That might be better, were they different Yet whatever I see happening I do not fly into a rage, as you do I gently accept men as they are Accustom myself to their conduct And I think that for court or town My calmness is as good philosophy as your choler But can this well-judged calmness Be roused by nothing? Lf, perchance, a friend betrays you Tries to steal what's yours Or slanders... Excuse me. Christine. How are you? Did you get my message? Not before next week, yes. I can't really talk, we're rehearsing. Yes, that's right. Me too, big kiss. Bye. I'm sorry. But can this well-judged calmness Be roused by nothing? Lf, perchance, a friend betrays you Tries to steal what's yours Or slanders your name Would you not then grow angry? Excuse me. Oh, Rapha?lle. Sweet of you to call back. You're sure it's no trouble? What about the keys? The cleaner? Yes. Madame Fran?on. I'll move in tomorrow morning. Fine. That's very kind, Rapha?lle. Thank you so much. Goodbye. Rapha?lle De La Puisaye, the publisher. She's lending me her house. So, where were we? "Well-judged calmness". But can this well-judged calmness Be roused by nothing? Lf, perchance, a friend betrays you, or... For fuck's sake! That's insufferable! I turn my phone off during rehearsal! You don't even have a cell! I do! But no one has the number. We can't carry on like this! Turn it off, we're doing Moli?re! Calm down. It's rung 15 times already! Not 15, three times. Sorry, but I have things to organize in Paris. Anyway, I'll switch the phone off. There, it's off. I'll put it in my coat, and I'll put the coat on the bed. There! Is that OK? I don't know how you work in Paris. Cellphones over Moli?re. Now I've lost my place. Start with "calmness". But can this well-judged calmness Be roused by nothing? Lf, perchance, a friend betrays you Tries to steal what's yours Or slanders your name Would you not then grow angry? Wait, hold it there. I don't understand. You're going to play it so fast? Am I going so fast? Yes. Alceste is laying himself open, and you're going flat out. What do you expect? You think this a first? They've been here 10 times before. Alceste and Philinte are old friends, that's key. Well I'm not getting friendship. How exactly do you want me to do it? I'd say... No, wait, what you want is... But can this well-judged calmness Be roused by nothing? That's a bit labored. Obviously, that doesn't work. Yet that's what you're asking me to do. It's unbelievable. You can't take the slightest criticism. You can say what you like, as long as it makes sense. Yes, I can look on those faults As vices bound with human nature And I am no more shocked To see a man deceitful Unjust and selfish Than to see vultures hungry for prey Or monkeys mischievous, or wolves snarling See myself betrayed and robbed And not... Heavens! I will not speak of it Your reasoning is so flawed Better hold your tongue Rail less against your adversary And take care of your own No such thing, it's settled Who'll solicit for you then? Reason, my just rights, equity You'll call on no judge? No. Is my cause unjust? I agree with you, yet it niggles I won't budge a step, right or wrong - Beware - I won't budge Your adversary is cunning No matter - You're mistaken - We'll see It will be a joy to lose my suit But surely... Incredible... Alceste is dragged to justice and puts up no defense. That's just what happened to me during my depression. Is it true, then? Were you really depressed? Absolutely. I even did 5 weeks' sleep therapy, at Sainte-Anne hospital. I had to stop work. That's not the rumor in the trade. They said you were in a luxury clinic, that you were just fine. David Gilbert said that? I'm just saying what I heard, that's all. I heard you walked out a week before filming. I couldn't walk. I lost 12kg. All David could think about was his crappy film. You think he came to see me even once? A producer with whom I'd made 5 films over 20 years. And who then sues me. I don't understand, if you couldn't work, why not get a psychiatric report? Screw psychiatrists! I thought we could find an amicable solution. Instead, what does he do? He sues. He claimed 500,000 euros in damages. Wait, I really don't get this. You had a trump card. Why not use it? Because I wanted to know just how far he'd go. David was like a brother to me. We vacationed together, I was godfather to his daughter. You see, Gauthier, that's the reality of this business. There's no friendship, no fidelity, no loyalty. That screwed me up so much, I ended up here. I haven't moved since. Heads. I'm Philinte. - You be Alceste, if you like. - No, it's fine. Being too perfect may be blameworthy Sound judgment shuns extremes And will be virtuous in its sobriety The unbending moral of old times Clashes with our age and common usage They ask of mortals perfection We must yield to the times, and with inflection "Inflection", no, that's all wrong. What do you mean? Because "inflection", as you're saying, you... You have to stress the final syllable. You have to stress it, or there's one missing. So it's: "Inflec-shee-on", "perfec-shee-on". That's utterly archaic. Those are alexandrines. They have 12 syllables. We must yield... with inflection as you said it, is one short. It's only 11. You have to say: We must yield to the times, and with inflec-shee-on. Screw the syllables. I'm not doing the classics at school. It's for today's audience. Is that so? Because you know what today's audience likes? People will come because it deals with today's issues. They don't want ancient. I suppose you like coloring movies, because black-and-white is outdated. I don't see the link. Moli?re's no screenwriter. He didn't write TV series. Moli?re's about alexandrines. Swallow them up if you like, but they must be delivered. I'm acting TV style? I didn't say you're acting for TV. Moli?re has a musical structure, it's organic. You can't think about the verse, you have to feel it! Our job is to connect with people, agreed? To avoid pointless elitism, acting like a lord, your little finger raised. When you do the classics, you must respect the verse! - Know what Jouvet used to say? - Enough! Screw Jouvet! Jouvet said if you take a syllable out of a line, it's like asking for a kilo of oranges, and getting 800g! It's called theft! Here's what we'll do: If you want to say it old style, fine. Inflec-shee-on, prepara-shee-on, masturba-shee-on, whatever. But let me say the text my way, OK? What is it? Hello, Mr Maynard. Come in. Hello, how are you? Fine. I've come... about the houses. Which houses? You didn't get my message? We're rehearsing so we turned our phones off! I've 2 great houses... Never mind the houses, we're rehearsing Moli?re! Hang on, I'm interested. Let's go see the houses. - Shall we, Mr Meynard? - Yes, sure... Come on then, let's go. - You with us? - Coming! Hello. Can I help you? Christophe Meynard from the realtor, for the visit. Yes, the visit. I brought these gentlemen. Hello. Hello. You might have informed me. We haven't even talked terms. I thought it would be OK. I tell you now, you're not sole agent. I'm in a hurry. I've contacted another realtor. - Is that a problem? - No, just that... That's how it is. Better find a buyer then. Come on, I'll show you round. The main bedroom. What's the total floor space? 110 square meters for the house, 100 for the garden. I'll show you upstairs. The kids' bedrooms? There's no kids' bedrooms. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry. This is the office and the library. Huge gaffe on the kids' room. - You think? - Yeah, a huge gaffe. Classy place, don't you think? It's a nice property. What's she asking? 1.8 million. 1.8 million for 110m2? That's more than Paris! Let's not hang about. Excuse us, we'll be off. Sorry, I'm very busy. It's alright, you weren't expecting us. If you like we could meet some other time, for a drink perhaps. No thanks. You do know that Gauthier is an actor, a very famous one. I used to be well-known, too, but I quit, so I'm less known now. We don't know French actors in Italy. I insist, meet us for a drink. Or dinner. What do you think Serge? An excellent idea. I ought to be flattered to have a drink with 2 famous actors, but I'm not in the mud. You mean "in the mood". That's right. In the mood. And I should add, I don't like actors. They're narcissistic. What makes you think we're narcissistic? She's got a point, you are quite. I am not narcissistic. Well, I'd like to be left alone. Gentlemen, goodbye. Goodbye. About the contract... Drop it in the letterbox. Thanks for the visit. You know, actors may be narcissistic but they have feelings... Yeah, sure. Did you see that? - Who does she think she is? - So ill-mannered... What a pretentious bitch! She won't sell like that. The mill was working until 1920. Back then the isle grew its own wheat. When you close your eyes you can smell the flour. - How much are they asking? - 1.15 million. But they'd drop to 1 million. That's more reasonable. Are you kidding? 1 million for a house like this? It's a snip. You could put a bedroom here. Sure, do some work and after 6 months, you can sell for at least 300,000 more. It's a unique location. You have to fall in love with a house. It's like a woman, there's a little voice inside. You have to listen to that voice. - I have to talk to Christine. - Surprise her! You're kidding. 1 million! What if she doesn't like it? What's a million to you? It's nothing. What's an episode worth? I don't want to say. Come on, don't be coy. Really, how much per episode? - You really want to know? - Yes. 200,000. 200,000... How many episodes a season? Six. Shit! What do you with it? Put it under the mattress? - Why are you getting cross? - I'm not. I just don't understand. I mean, you still act small-time, when actually you're at the top of the heap. It's like you're in denial. Let me tell you something. I'm not buying this house. And for the record, I don't like the Ile de R?. I hate the whole Catholic family vibe, the blond kids, it's awful. It's the opposite of sexy. I like sun. It's freezing here! Sorry, last summer was wonderful. The isle has a microclimate. Screw your microclimate! I want heat, and to walk about all day in a G-string if I feel like it. The Ile de R? is still ranked France's 2nd favorite holiday spot. It's in Le Point magazine. You can't come to the Ile de R? and not go cycling. That one's too old. This one's fine. It's a bit dirty, I'll clean that up. There. Here, try it. Wait a second. That's OK. The brakes don't work! No problem, there are no hills here, nothing. It's a total wreck. My eyes are far too offended Both court and town provoke my spleen - I fall into black... ... humors and deep sorrow When I see men treat each other as theydo. Your turn... I see nothing but base flattery - Injustice... ... Treachery... ...Selfishness, deceit My eyes are far too offended... Asshole! Piece of shit bicycle! What an asshole! Give me a hand! They're a bunch of scum. Come on, this way. Come on. Your fucking bike's got no brakes! That stinks, it's awful. Dammit! These were my uncle's. They should fit you. Here. You're in great shape. Do you work out? A little. 3 or 4 times a week. You must drive the chicks wild. And this Christine, how long's it been? Three years. She's a brain surgeon. I met her researching "Dr Morange". Where are you at? She won't move in with me and vice versa. And she's got this daughter aged 12 who doesn't speak to me. Not even hello. Sounds like a bit of a dead end. We broke up 10 times, but... Maybe you should turn the page? No, you don't get it. I really do love her. I've become a solitary creature. Are you kidding? If you really wanted to hide, you wouldn't be here. You'd be in depths of the Larzac, the Vercors or the Aveyron. The Ile de R?'s not really off the beaten track. It's cos of the bridge. That spoilt it. Well, I'll be off. Wait, don't go yet. Deep down, I'm glad you came. I like acting with you. Thank you. So, what do you say? You want me to say if I'll do it? Yes, I'd like that. It's not that simple. Yes it is. You say yes and we don't mention it again. Wait, I've got 2 days. That's the deal. You're not giving an inch. 10 o'clock tomorrow, then. I can't. I'm going to La Rochelle. - But you don't like the town. - I have a hospital appointment. - Nothing serious, I hope. - No, just a vasectomy. You're only out 30 minutes. We can rehearse after lunch. You're getting a vasectomy? I've been thinking about it for years. 6 months ago I nearly did it. Now I feel ready. You don't want to screw anymore? That's not it. Vasectomy's nothing like castration. It just means severing the sperm ducts. It has no adverse effect on erection or ejaculation. So what's the point? To avoid any chance of bringing a kid into the world. I already made the mistake of having a son. Never again. You've got a son? Not a word for 10 years. He works in the nuclear industry. Atomic fission, Chernobyl, Fukushima, that's guys like him. I don't want kids either, but the snip? I need to make this gesture. It's a courageous gesture. A vasectomy! Nonsense! Here you are. You remember my niece, Zo?? - The one who wants to act? - Zo?, yes. Could you have a quick word? Her mom would be thrilled. - Of course. - That's kind. Zo?, can you come here? Hurry up! Today's youth, always sleeping. They're so tired. You're off to Ms De La Puisaye's? Yes, I'm staying at her place. It's at St Martin en R?. - Do you know it? - No. I can call a taxi, if you like. Alright. - You could make an effort. - I'm up at dawn. - I've made pancakes. - That's sweet of you. Say hello to Mr Valence. - Hello. - Hello, Zo?. I didn't dare ask before, but can I get an autograph? With pleasure. It's for Cookie, my boyfriend. Well, if it's for Cookie... He's a fan. Hi. Can I give you a ride? It'll be quicker than the bus. That's kind, but I'm in no rush. Sorry about yesterday. I just had a call from my husband. We're having a messy divorce. It upsets me every time we talk. It was silly to say I don't like actors. I don't know why I did. I'm with you. I can't stand them either. You see, we agree. My name's Francesca. Hello, Francesca. You coming, then? No, women drivers scare me. Because of your mother? She drove badly and you were traumatized... I know a guy who had a vasectomy. He couldn't walk for 6 months. Really? The surgeon must have cut a nerve. It's a very delicate spot, that's sure. My ex said he didn't want kids. I was dumb enough to listen. He left me for a woman and had a son. Hence the sale? Yes. I want to move on. We're all going to die. No point getting attached to things. In 30 years, my hand'll be covered in liver spots. We'll be all flabby and wrinkled. That's life. Time destroys everything. I should have taken the bus. I'll come back around 2pm, OK? Alright, thanks a lot. Excuse me, I'm here to see Prof Rubinstein. Ah, Mr Tanneur. Sorry for the delay. - The head nurse is sick. - Yes, wait... Finding a replacement, you know it's not easy in hospitals nowadays. - See you in theater. - I wanted... Yes, Gilbert, what do you expect? I always get roped in. I wanted to ask... Undress and put on a blue gown. I'll be back in 5 minutes. Yes, Gilbert, what can I say? Everything will be fine. The anesthetic. No, listen. I've changed my mind. I don't want it. - You don't want what? - The operation! Isn't it a bit late to say that now? Thank you. Thanks, goodbye. Hello, Mr Valence. Hello, how are you? Remember you told me to call Prof Delahaye in Bordeaux? - Yes. - About my mother. I mentioned your name. But he never called back. That's not like him. Hello, I'm a friend of Rapha?lle. Yes, I was expecting you. Don't worry, I'll call the professor back. Goodbye. This is very nice. When you think what it all cost... My husband worked on the conversion. It was never good enough for her. She made them rip out the tiles. The red wasn't red enough. Honestly... There was a fisherman's cottage just there, demolished in the blink of an eye. A whole family could have lived there. To think there's homeless in France... I agree with you, such inequalities are shocking. What's that? That's the Jacuzzi. Animals used to drink there. Now Madame splashes around here at night, with no bathing suit... Mind if I play some music? Not at all. I saw my notary in La Rochelle. He's got a buyer for the house. You must be glad. In fact, no. Exactly the opposite, I'm sad. It's silly. That's me all over. I think one thing, and feel another. I detest nostalgia, yet I regret many things. I think people's contradictions are beautiful. Really? I went to Trousse Chemise, round the lighthouse and back by the marshes. You've got the cycling bug. I love it. Remember Francesca? Of course, Madame hates actors. I got over it, you see. Sorry, the house is sold. Congratulations. Anyway, I've decided not to buy. Rehearsal in 20 minutes? See you then. Be careful. How about that? You bump into the hot Italian and drop the vasectomy. - Nonsense. - That was it. You're going to have a bunch of piccoli bambini. Are you done? You're a pain. While you were in town, I got to know Zo?. Really? Who's Zo?? The niece of Madame Bichet, owner of Le Clocher. Zo?'s an actress. She wants to study acting, so I said she could drop by. No way. You know no one attends rehearsal. I knew you'd react that way. But you should know, Zo? is an actress in porn films. She's already done 4 or 5. It sounds like a very interesting job. No kidding. She's been at it 6 months but still has a certain candor. I can't decide if she's really dumb or above it all. Did you ask her about the shoots? Sure. She said porn actors are very nice folk, there's a good atmosphere, but she doesn't like the hours. You have to get up at dawn then drive to the set. She said, and I quote: A double penetration at 8 in the morning, it's not easy. A double penetration at 8am, it's not easy... Double penetration at 8, tough. At 10 o'clock, it's fine. You have to say, we live in an extraordinary age. Anyway, shall I tell her it's off? Absolutely not! What time did you say? I don't know, around 4. That leaves us time to rehearse. Heads or tails? Zo? brings you luck. You're Alceste. I'll spare no one on this point My eyes are far too offended Both court and town provoke my spleen I fall into black humors and deep sorrow When I see men treat each other as they do I see nothing but base flattery Injustice, treachery, selfishness, deceit I cannot endure it, it maddens me, and my aim Is to break with all mankind This wrath's too harsh I laugh at your black moods And see in us two brothers in the school for husbands... Wait, why've you been limping for 10 minutes? It's Alceste's back story. I work on the character's past. I imagined Alceste was forced by his father to ride a horse. He fell, and ever since he's limped. His hatred for society is a cry of rage at the father. There you go. No, really, have done with your pranks The world will not change for all your meddling Since you so admire frankness I tell you frankly, this distemper Is seen by all as comedy Such wrath against today's mores Makes you a laughing-stock for many So much the better, heavens! 'Tis what I ask That was too much. So much the better, heavens! 'Tis what I ask It's a good sign. I'm overjoyed I hate mankind so much I'd be cross if I was thought mild You have great spite for mankind Yes, I have an unutterable... That's not right. What d'you mean? It's an unutterable hatred... No, you're mistaken. It's not "unutterable". I have a fearful hatred for it It's not "fearful". It's "frightful". "A frightful hatred. ' Yes, I have a frighftul hatred for it It's funny how you get stuck on that. It's strange. As if for you, hatred is something unutterable. As if hatred cannot be put in words. Funny... The exact opposite of Alceste. Wait, I said the wrong word, it's no big deal. Yes, it is. It says a lot about you and your way of acting. You invent an absurd thing - this limping - and yet you cannot embrace the violence of the character. It's odd. You're playing Alceste whilst retaining your scruples. You know, it's as if your kindness, your education... as if something's embarrassing you. I'd say it's your sheer civility. What do you know about my civility? What is civility, anyway? Explain that to me. - Well, civility's... - What, exactly? - It's what stops you... - Go on, say it. ...getting to the emotion. - Getting where? - To the feeling. Of what? What civility? What feeling? The emotion of the character's actions. You know what? I'm sick of this. I've had all I can take, you hear? That's enough. Hello. Hello, Zo?. I got a bit lost, am I late? It's fine. Is everything OK? Yes, fine. - Shall we go inside? - Hello, Miss. Serge Tanneur. - How are you? - Good, thanks. Would you like a drink? I don't have time. Cookie said we have to go to Paris. And who's Cookie? My boyfriend. We're getting married in September. Bravo. This way, please. We're going to Bucharest for work, to meet some people. What are you doing there? There's many shoots there. Not like France, very pro. So you're really going to make a career in porn? Maybe not a career. I don't want to do it my whole life. Just to put some cash away, then we'll see. And Cookie comes on shoots so I'm not on my own. Shall we do a bit of "The Misanthrope"? I did that one in school. It's about a Catholic guy who lives with a family and wants to bed the wife. That's "Tartuffe". We're doing "The Misanthrope". It's about a guy who's mad at all his friends. - Shall we do a scene? - Yes, great. - You'd like that? - Yes, sure. If it's not too long. My train's at 8. Shall we do the scene with Oronte? Great. A wonderful scene. - So, who's Oronte? - I'll do Oronte. - I like him. - You want to do Oronte? Oronte is a member of the court who comes to read a poem to Alceste. And do you mean to suggest by this That I am wrong to wish? I don't say that I don't say that! But I meant, frigid writing bores Thisweakness is enough to damn a man Though he may have many fine qualities For men are judged by failings Then do you think my sonnet poor? I don't say that Go seek your praise elsewhere Don't take such lofty airs Faith, mighty sir, I'll take whatever air I please That was wonderful, wonderful! Remarkable. Well? I told Cookie I'll be a bit late. Did you like it? Yes, it was great. I really loved it. I should be going. But it was very kind to invite me. You're leaving right away? I have a train at 8. No, you must read a few Moli?re verses. - Verses? - Yes, some alexandrines. Leave her be. Zo? has acting ambitions, so she can read to us. You want to be an actress, don't you? Find me the scene with... C?lim?ne. I think it's scene 3, act 4. You're mad, with your jealous frenzies It's a bit tricky. Say it simply, with rhythm. I'd like to know what might compel me To stoop for you to base deceit Orwhy, if my heart leant another way I wouldn't say it with sincerity What! Does the assurance of my feelings not defend me from your suspicions? What are they worth, against such a pledge? Don't you offend me by heeding them? And since our heart makes such effort When it comes down to confessing love Since the honor of our sex, enemy of passion Bitterly opposes such avowals Must the lover for whom we break this prohibition then doubt this oracle? Such suspicions deserve my anger And you are not worthy of my esteem How was that? You can say if... No... It was... It was very, very good. It was good. To think that next week she'll be in Bucharest... We could've done something for her, no? No, she's old enough to sort things out. All the same... We're just a pair of old farts. Why not come spend the weekend here? Christine, you always say we're not together often. You wouldn't be in my way. OK, let's think about it. Big kiss. Yes, love you too. I turned a knob and the Jacuzzi went crazy. It was bubbling like mad. I tried to get up, slipped and nearly died. I was alone. I shouted, no one came. I took 30 minutes to get my breath back. What a way to go! James Dean in a Porsche, Gauthier Valence in a Jacuzzi. - It's not funny. - That's a good one. Not funny at all. I have to go. I've got to finish packing for the move. - Will you come by tonight? - With pleasure. I've still got loads to get rid of, books, ornaments... We'll come after rehearsal. OK, see you later. Bye Francesca, ciao. She's amazing, isn't she? No, it's universal: I hate all men... Don't judge it too rigorously... Get some Pont-L'Ev?que. Really? I don't like soft cheese. In that case, get some Comt?. There. - I'll pay by card. - Fine. - Let's split it. - No, I'll get it. No, I've got it. You're on the cover of T?l? Poche. "Dr Morange", in prime time, and you didn't tell me? There's nothing to say. Let's watch it. I'm not sure I want to. Yes. I've never seen an episode. Exactly, you don't need to. But I want to see how you tackle it. It's not Shakespeare... The minor works reveal the great actors. - You don't even watch the news? - No, too depressing. Hello, Francesca. Hello. You brought oysters. Wonderful. They're Gillardeaus. Put them on the table there. Where's the aerial socket? By the fireplace. Let's put that over there. Can I help? No, it's fine. Would you like a drink? Yes, great. What's that odd smell? It's just the septic tank. I'll light a lavender candle. I'll turn it up. Sit here, Francesca. Be warned. It's TV, not cinema. But there are one or two bits I'm quite pleased with. Now, in the film, I'm guilty over the death of my wife, who I couldn't save. There's a scene where I totally break down. For that, I delved into some very painful, personal stuff. It's a bit edgy. You'll see... It's a cyst. And the worst kind. An epidermoid cyst on the cerebellopontine angle. I've never seen one that big. It must weigh at least 800g. We must operate. An epi-der-moid cyst... - It's too risjy. - We can't do nothing. I remind you, you failed at this before. Isn't once enough? At first, she couldn't talk, then couldn't walk. Then she went blind. Your daughter, we'll save her, Mrs Ramirez. That's brilliantly said. That's greatness, there's no acting. It's fluid. Did you see that? Remarkable. You've no business being here! What's going on? I won't treat Miss Ramirez. What? You're giving up! Hello? Hi, Meynard. No, you're not interrupting anything... I never forgot that desert storm. Nothing could stop you. B?atrice was still alive, I had faith in medicine. Do your duty, Dr Morange. 2.5 million! That's absurd! People are totally crazy. Nothing special, watching "Dr Morange" with Gauthier... Sorry, I couldn't get away. So, what happened? The Ramirez girl is still in a coma. Turn it off, that'll do. No way. You can't turn it off now. What happens to the Ramirez girl? Yes, really, we're enjoying it. It was a bad idea. I love your "We'll save her, Mrs Ramirez. " Goodnight, Francesca. Gauthier, don't take it badly. Come back! Stay here with us! That wasn't very nice. I'm disappointed in you. It's like you enjoyed hurting him. A little. You're no Alceste. Alceste is a pure, sincere man. You toy with people. Wait, he was the one who came to seek me out. And you're making him pay. You should apologize. Apologize? No. - You don't want to? - No. - Shame. - You're not leaving too? Hello, doctor! Hello, Dr Morange! Nice strawberries. May I taste? Be my guest. Oh, it was great! Last night, you were so... - Can I have an autograph please? - Of course. Ah, the good Dr Morange. Such a generous man. Meanwhile, my mom's still waiting. I'm sorry. I left a personal message for the professor. I can't do any more. Like I should believe you. I don't care if you do or not. There you go, you play the hero, but you don't give a shit about others. And my mom's stuck in a wheelchair... It's not my fault she broke her hip. You actors, you're in your shitty little universe. That'll do. - What d'you mean? - I said that'll do! - Thanks, have a nice day. - You too. What happened? I got in a fight. This'll hurt a bit. To think that I even called Professor Delahaye... I wanted to say, I really enjoyed last night. I loved when you said: "We'll save her, Mrs Ramirez. " Yeah, sure. - Shall we start? - Heads or tails? No. Today, I'm doing Alceste. What do you mean? Is that a problem? My eyes are far too offended Both court and town provoke my spleen I fall into black humors and deep sorrow When I see men treat each other as they do I see nothing but base flattery Injustice, treachery, selfishness, deceit I cannot endure it, it maddens me, and my aim Is to break with all mankind This wrath's too harsh I laugh at your black moods And see in us two brothers in the school for husbands Drop your dull comparisons No, really, have done with your pranks The world will not change for all your meddling Since you so admire frankness I tell you frankly, this distemper Is seen by all as comedy Such wrath against today's mores Makes you a laughing-stock for many So much the better, heavens! 'Tis what I ask It's a good sign. I'm overjoyed I hate mankind so much, I'd be cross if I was thought mild You have great spite for mankind Yes, I have an unutterable... "Frightful". I know! I have a frighftul hatred for it Are all poor mortals, without exception To be included in this aversion? There are surely some, even nowadays No, it's universal: I hate all men I have to say, that's phenomenal. Phenomenal. You've really got it. It's fabulous. Let me tell you: I don't give a shit what you think. I don't need your approval. What mark will you give me? 14 out of 20? 17? I'm not your student, you're not my teacher. For five days you've been messing with me. It's over. You never meant to do the play. The only thing you're interested in is the power you have over people. You like having me at your mercy. Believe me... I swear I don't want... I sought you out because I admired you. That's the truth. But you're such a piece of shit that there's no point. No more toying with me: "Maybe I'll tell you tomorrow... " It's over! Maybe you don't need anyone. But I certainly don't need you! Goodbye. He got angry. It's not all over. Yes, this time it's really the end. He told me I could die alone. I think you should get that vasectomy. That's not a nice thing to say. I'm just kidding. In truth, I liked playing Alceste with him. Alternating the roles... that's never been done. You're dying to act again, but you're too proud to admit it. Let me fix the chain. I was an asshole. It'd be good if you... if we both did it. Did what? The play. "The Misanthrope". You want to, then? I'd like to do it together. Give me your bike. If you like. What do you think? Shall we do it? Alright, let's do it. How's it going, boys? Bunch of assholes! I hate this. - You Ok? - I'm fine. Watch the brakes! Let's go! Let's run! Come on! Hello, Tamara? It's me. It's in the bag! He's agreed to do it. You can draw up the contracts. Call Roussel and Rinieri, too. I thought maybe you could come down this weekend. We could finalize it all. What do you think? Yes, I'll count on you then. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. I'm going to bed, then. I can speak Italian too, you know. I was preparing for my death scene, and I was going back over my whole life, the most emotional moments, concentrating, ready to die. And next to me, I hear the make-up girl asking the hairdresser: "What're you having for dinner tonight? ' ...an intense mood, like at Avignon, when you play the Popes' Palace. I was slap bang in the middle of the situation, and I say the line: "I'd like to sit down again. " I say it while I'm sitting. And there's an almighty pause. I totally blanked, I was utterly petrified. I just wanted to die. - I'm off. - You're leaving? Yes, I'm going home. I'll come with you. No. Till tomorrow. At first, I had a bad feeling about Francesca. I was totally wrong about her. When will the premiere be? In September. It'd be nice if Francesca could come, no? Did you see her reaction when I offered the guest room? That was a major breakthrough. D'you think? Better get an Alitalia loyalty card. An Alitalia card, really? - Excuse me. - Yes? Ms Francesca's left. She took the early train. I just went to Francesca's and she's gone. How about that? Didn't even say goodbye. You want a coffee? No, thanks. I have to tell you something. Well... Something happened last night. I forgot my cellphone, so I went back to Francesca's to get it. I knocked on the door and went in. I called out, no reply. I went upstairs. There she was, alone in her room, crying. She'd just spoken to her ex-husband. She was devastated. She threw herself at me, clinging like a drowning woman. Then what? Then... the inevitable happened. What do you think I care? Listen, we're all grown-ups. You're not mad at me? Why would I be? Like I fell in love in 4 days? Yes, you're right. Christine's about to arrive. She won't find out. Trust me. Hello. See you at St Martin? Gauthier called last night. He's so glad to be acting with Serge. That's Gauthier. Smooth as you like, but gets what he wants. True. Excuse me, you mean Gauthier Valence? Yes, why? He's crazy. Look what he did to me. I ask him a favor for my mom, he punches me. - Gauthier hit you? - Nearly broke my nose. Jacuzzi's are meant to be powerful! It massages the back. Yes, but I nearly drowned. That's so funny. Sorry, excuse me. I took the liberty of inviting a few friends for a drink. Of course. And I have a favor to ask. Sure. Would you mind posing for a few photos, in the house? Long as it's not in the tub. Ah, darling! - Lovely to see you. - You too. We'll talk in just a minute. Hello. How was the trip? Excellent. We'll talk in a minute over a drink. I love this new dress. So you punched the taxi driver? I guess I lost it. I like a bit of rough! Oh yeah? They say acting is like making love, and it's true. Don't overdo it. It's a certain chemistry, anyway. You look marvelous, my dear Serge. That's saved the production a few bucks. - Here. - No, I'm on water. - What for? Let's toast! - No, thanks. You must be Gauthier's lady, delighted to meet you. Thank you. Since he's been here, he's reconciled me with acting. You kidnapped him for a week, I wondered if he'd return. My apologies. Are you really a neurosurgeon? Yes, but not as dashing as Dr Morange. You're here, too. If you need advising on the contract, I'm here. Very kind. Thank you. I'm not working during rehearsal, so no question of any shoots, OK? But we've signed for lots of things. - Too bad, cancel. - Are you kidding? We've planned for 8 weeks of rehearsal. That's good. Moli?re needs that. What about touring? Kept to a minimum, 4 major cities: Lyon, Marseille, Lille, Bordeaux. 3 months in all. Not too long. That seems perfect. Will you perform a bit for us? A bit of what? A little scene, just for the pleasure. No. I really don't want to. Come on, Serge. Heads or tails, as usual. Heads. Lucky me, I'm Alceste. Up till now, I always got Philinte. I'm not being Philinte. - What do you mean? - I'm playing Alceste. You can pass on Philinte now, if you like. But in the theater, we take turns. No, we're not taking turns. I play Alceste or I don't play. What have we been doing? I don't know. Not my problem. Are you backing out? No, I'm telling you I play Alceste, period. No way I'm playing Philinte. Hang on, we both rehearsed each role, that's what we agreed. Did we agree you screw the Italian? No, but you still went and did it. Who's this Italian? - He's talking rubbish. - Who is she? - What's got into to you? - I play Alceste. I don't play Philinte. I should smash your face. The friend of mankind, the embodiment of generosity, the man who shares suffering, yet always up for a fight. - Leave him alone! - Get off! Gauthier, leave him alone! You're a real bastard! Stop it. Let him go! Stay on your fucking isle! Go squat in your septic tank! We don't need you! I wanted to, but this time, it's really over. What does he say? The times we live in are so perverse That I must shun all company of men The pain of it is too much to bear Let's retire from this wild and cut-throat place Since among mankind you live like wolves Traitors, you won't see me among you in all my days I'll be right there. What is it? What's the matter? Leave me, pray What strange humor is this? Leave me, I say. Out of my sight Can't you listen, without anger? I want to be angry, and I will not listen I cannot understand your bursts of temper And though we're friends, I'm first I, your friend? Strike that I may have been so until now But after what you just did I am no longer I want no place in rotten hearts Am I so guilty, Alceste? Heavens, you should die for shame 'Tis inexcusable Men of honor would be scandalized It's a good sign. I'm overjoyed I hate mankind so much I'd be cross if I was thought mild You have great spite for mankind Yes, I have an unutterable hatred... Yes, I have a fearful hatred... No, that's not it. You have great spite for mankind Yes, I have a frighftul hatred for it Cycling with Moli?re Translation: Charles Masters Subtitling: C.M.C. - Paris
