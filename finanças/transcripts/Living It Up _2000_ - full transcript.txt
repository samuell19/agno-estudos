BUT THINGS CHANGED. IT GOT HARDER TO ROB YOU AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU. - LIAR. - THAT'S WHY I LEFT. I COULDN'T GO ON. LIAR, LIAR. YOU LIED ABOUT YOUR SISTER TOO. DIDN'T YOU LIVE WITH HER? WHERE IS SHE? BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE HER. LITTLE SISTER, WHERE ARE YOU? DON'T HIDE, LOLA'S SISTER. WHERE ARE YOU? OR MAYBE YOU DON'T EXIST. WHAT'S HER NAME? GINNY. GIN IS WHAT YOU DRINK. AND SHE'S NOT HERE BECAUSE SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL. THE BILLS AREN'T CHEAP. I HAD TO GET THE MONEY FROM SOMEWHERE. WAITRESSES DON'T EARN MUCH, YOU KNOW. HER FAMILY IS ALL SHE HAS. SHE CAN'T MOVE. SHE DIDN'T LIKE LIFE. SHE BEGAN TO HATE IT. AND IF YOU START HATING LIFE, LIFE STARTS HATING YOU. I EXPECT SHE WAS A COWARD AND DECIDED TO GET OUT. LIKE YOUR FRIEND. LIKE YOUR FRIEND RAFA. LIAR, LIAR. YOU TRICKED ME BEFORE. I DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE YOU. ARE YOU TALKING TO ME ABOUT SINCERITY? WHAT ABOUT BEING A MILLIONAIRE, THE BUSINESS? RAFA'S HOUSE? WHO THE FUCK IS RAFA? THAT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S NOT SO DIFFERENT. IT'S THE SAME THING. I TRICKED YOU TO ROB YOU, AND YOU TRICKED ME TO GET LAID. YES. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WASN'T WORTH IT. GIVE ME THE CHECKBOOK. WHAT CHECKBOOK? THE ONE YOU TOOK FROM MY HOUSE, THIEF! I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE NO CHECKBOOK. LOLA, PLEASE. I SWEAR. HOW DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT, WITH MY BACK TURNED? I WASN'T GOING TO COME. I WAS AFRAID TO SEE YOU, BUT NOW I'M GLAD I DID. YOU CAN KEEP IT. THE ACCOUNT IS EMPTY. MARTIN. SALVA, IT'S MARTIN. I WANT TO SEE YOU. WHERE DO YOU THINK? NO, YOU LISTEN. AT A QUARTER TO 3:00. ON SENATE CORNER. ALONE, ALONE. IF YOU GOT A TIP FOR EVERY PASSENGER THAT GETS ON, JUST WORK IT OUT. AT AN AVERAGE OF 25 PESETAS, 600 PASSENGERS A DAY. WAIT, WAIT. THIS IS SERIOUS MONEY. WHY WOULD THEY GIVE YOU A TIP? THEY GIVE WAITERS TIPS. SAME THING. BUT THEY'RE GIVEN IT FOR THE SERVICE. WHAT ABOUT US? WE TAKE PEOPLE HOME. DOESN'T THAT SEEM LIKE LIP SERVICE? 15,000. 15,000, EVERY DAY. IMAGINE IN A MONTH. I THINK IT'S OBLIGATORY IN NEW YORK. REALLY? YEAH. AND THEY'RE ALL AMERICANS. FUCK, MARTIN. DIDN'T HE GET FIRED? HI. JERO, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR? IT'S LIKE A DEODORANT, WITH THE LITTLE HOLE FACING AWAY. AND BE CAREFUL. PROBLEMS? A FEW. SMALL ONES. HI. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON. LET'S GO, IVAN. BE COOL! ANYONE WHO MOVES IS DEAD MEAT! WHO IS HE? DON'T THEY KNOW ANYTHING? I PROMISED MY WIFE... SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO SEE ME IN JAIL AGAIN. I'M TRYING TO KEEP MY PROMISE. BUT YOU'RE STILL WORKING. YES, FOR MYSELF. IT'S SAFER. AND THE OTHERS? THE OTHERS? I WANT TO SEE THEM. I'VE THOUGHT IT THROUGH. I'll START TO WORK AND PUT PART OF WHAT I EARN IN A FIXED-TERM ACCOUNT. EIGHTY PERCENT, AND LIVE OFF THE REST. AND THEN THERE'S MY PHOTOS. I'VE BEEN TOLD THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD. MARTIN... WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND GET THEM IN A GALLERY, AND IF I SELL... YES, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY. MARTIN! "THESE ARE REALLY BAD GUYS." BUT I'M REALLY BAD TOO. AND IF IT ALL GOES AS PLANNED, I FIGURE THAT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS... THERE ARE NO OTHERS. WHAT DO YOU THINK? THERE ARE NO OTHERS. THERE ARE NO OTHERS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING TO ANYONE. WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY? THE MONEY? DID YOU EVER SEE ANY MONEY? NO. THERE YOU ARE. BUT IT WAS THERE. I BOUGHT THINGS, HAD DINNER IN EXPENSIVE PLACES. IT WAS THERE, BUT YOU NEVER TOUCHED IT. YOU SIGNED CHECKS. YOU MIGHT'VE BEEN SIGNING PAPER NAPKINS. I DID THE NEGOTIATING IN YOUR NAME, INVESTING IN THE APPROPRIATE PLACES, BUYING FROM GROUP COMPANIES. YOU WERE JUST A SPENDER. A PERSON TO SPEND FOR US. BUT WHY? FOR YOUR FINANCIAL IDENTITY. TO RECYCLE 100 MILLION WITHOUT AROUSING SUSPICION. WE USE PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO SPEND A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF DIRTY MONEY, TRYING TO REINVEST IN THE GROUP IT COMES FROM. IT COMES FROM THEM AND GOES BACK TO THEM. IT ALL STAYS AT HOME. FUCK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. WE GAVE YOU THE CHIPS TO PLAY, BUT IT'S OUR CASINO. RIGHT. AND THE BANKER ALWAYS WINS. ALWAYS. SHH. MONEY LAUNDERING. THE LAST TIME I HEARD THAT WAS IN FRONT OF A JUDGE. AND IT'S NOT A HAPPY MEMORY. WE FOLLOWED YOU. WE KNEW WHERE YOU WERE ALL THE TIME... AND WHAT YOU WERE SPENDING OUR MONEY ON. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WERE ONE OF THE BEST SPENDERS I'VE EVER SEEN. I KNEW IT FROM THE START. THIS GUY IS GOOD. I COULDN'T LET YOU GET AWAY. AND YOU WERE VERY GOOD. YOU LET YOURSELF GO. UNTIL THE INSECT APPEARED. IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES. YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST SPENDER... WHO ATTRACTS AN INSECT, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY AROUND. WE CALL THEM INSECTS BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFICULT TO ELIMINATE. AND THIS ONE WAS HOLDING ON TIGHT. SHE WAS PUTTING EVERYTHING IN DANGER TO MAKE THE MONEY FLY TO ANOTHER NEST. IF THINGS GET COMPLICATED, WE INTERVENE WITH INSECTICIDE. THIS TIME WE DIDN'T NEED TO. YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST. WE ALSO USE THE DESPERATE, AND IF THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND, LIKE YOU, WE GET THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY. AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME NOW? THE COMPANY THINKS YOU'RE IN BRAZIL. YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE. YOU HAVE 10,000 PESETAS LEFT. TAKE HER OUT TO DINNER. I'M GOING. I HAVE WORK TO DO. DON'T COMPLAIN. YOU LIVED IT UP, DIDN'T YOU? COME ON. YOU'RE FALLING ASLEEP. LOOK AT THAT FOR A PRESENT. BUT HE HAS PUS IN HIS TEETH. YOU'RE EITHER RICH OR GOOD-LOOKING. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL. YOU'VE NOT SEEN PRETTY WOMAN. WHAT'S UP? LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOIN'! SHIT! MARTIN! HOW DID YOU FIND ME? LOOKING FOR YOU. I HAVE LOTS TO TELL YOU. NOT HERE. LET'S GO. WAIT. I'll GET CHANGED. HOW'S IT GOING, MARTIN? GOOD. IF THE MARKETS DON'T CALM DOWN, WE'LL HAVE TO RAISE PRICES OURSELVES. PROBABLY. IF WE WANT THINGS TO LIVEN UP A LITTLE... FUCK. SHE'S NOT BAD. AT LEAST A NINE. A NINE? DON'T YOU THINK? YOU THINK THAT'S HIGH? EIGHT AND A HALF? WHAT HAPPENED? THE MARTINI WAS A LITTLE LOADED. LET'S GO. THIS ISN'T HOW IT GOES. WHY? WAIT. YOU HARDLY KNOW ME. NOR YOU ME. - LOLA. - MARTIN. WHAT DO YOU DO? I ROB THE RICH. - AND YOU? - I DRIVE PEOPLE. LET'S SAY I TAKE THEM WHERE THEY REALLY WANT TO GO. WHAT ARE YOU, A MAGICIAN OR SOMETHING?
