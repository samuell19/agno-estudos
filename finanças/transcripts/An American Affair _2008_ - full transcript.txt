I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, do solemnly swear… That I will faithfully execute the office… Militiamen that our troops were receiving Soviet bloc weapons.

Not exactly. Not to me. Thought so. Carl said you were a fag. So? So he said you were a fag. Wow, what are you gonna do? Nothing. You can't do nothing. Some friend you are. Come on, fag. You're the fag. Let's see what you got. Fight, fight! Ohh! That's for setting me up. What are you doing? Nothing, sister. God smiles on the obsequious, Mr. Stafford, not in the impenitent. Gentlemen, it's 5:00. Detention is over. In the eyes of god, all sinners can be redeemed. Yes, sister. My eyes see different things. Yes, sister. Jimmy, I… fuck you. I didn't mean… You're an asshole, both of you. Mom?

Roger, have you seen Patricia this morning? She's really pretty, yeah? Mike? Would you hurry up? What's the rush? King gets arrested all the time. I want a good seat. "John Fitzgerald Kennedy." "To have seen what I have seen and see what I see. "Use with care. Love, George." "Catherine Caswell." Catherine. Can I help you with something? Yeah, I… I live across the street. Yes? And I… I was wondering if you needed any work done, you know, in the garden, around the house. I'm trying to earn some money. For what? A trip to Europe with my class. That's sounds very adventurous. Adam. Adam. Are you coming in? What can you do? What? Around the house. Oh, clean, fix. All the usual stuff. And you want me to pay you for that? For my trip. To Europe? Mm-hmm. You know him? President Kennedy? We've met. My mom shook hands with him once, at dinner. She said it made her feel like she was naked. Your father must not have liked that too much. My dad says he stole the election by being a pretty boy on television. What do you think? I don't know. I didn't see it. I need my garden landscaped. Can you do that? Sure. You ever do it before, worked in a garden? Then I'm not gonna pay you very much, am I? I'm a fast learner. I bet you are. Come back tomorrow. Right. Tomorrow. Made her feel like she was naked. Shit. Adam, dinner. Coming. Now, Adam. Now. Said I'm coming. He's not in the bathroom again, is he? Adam. Adam. I said I'd be right there. Hey, faith. Hi. Hi, Patricia. Dipshit. Fuck off, Carl. Right, fuck off. Okay. I was just wondering if, you know, you'd want to come by my house sometime after school. And do what? I don't know. Talk, listen to some records. Yeah, I'd like that. Great, so… Mr. Stafford, is there the faintest possible reason you might have for not being where you're supposed to be? No, sister. I thought not. It's me, Adam, from next door. Your garden… Right. I'm going to work in your garden. Who painted these? I did. Do you like them? I think so, but they're just color, though, right? They aren't supposed to mean anything? Mm, color is color. What do they mean? Whatever you want them to. Things are what we make of them. Form is dead. What? Form is dead. You ever seen an abandoned building: Broken windows, cracked doors, and walls? Sure. From the moment that building was built, it was starting to fall apart. It just depends on how you choose to look at it. Form is dead. That's cool. I like that. It looks pretty good to me. I want you to rip it all up. All of it? Everything. Just pull it up and throw it all away. I want dirt, a new beginning, nothing boxed or constrained. Rip it all up, and we'll start all over again. Form is dead, right? Exactly. That might help. You look beautiful. I bet you say that to all the girls. No. Finish up that tree, then head on home. The Cubans are never gonna forgive Kennedy, ever. Well, it's not like it matters. We've got communists living 90 miles away. Hell, Castro laughs at us, laughs at us. Well, you look like you've been digging to China. Where have you been? Working in the garden. What garden? Mrs. Caswell's. Who? Mrs. Caswell. She moved in across the street. Catherine Caswell? Mm-hmm. Why don't you have a seat, bud? Catherine Caswell. She's very nice, isn't she? Yeah, I like her. She's a very special lady. She is someone who has seen and done a lot of things. Too many things. She has had a very hard life. She is very emotional. And maybe she's not the best person for you to be working for after school. Why not? Well, it isn't easy to explain. She's different than we are, Adam. She doesn't care about the same things. She doesn't care about her own son, for god's sake. Addie. She has a son? Had a son. Had. What happened? It doesn't matter what happened. What matters is that you stay away from her. You… You said to get a job to earn some money. You said… Fine, get a job, just not with… Okay, Adam, working for her is all right. Mike. Just don't linger, okay? Do what she asks, then come home. Okay, bud? Okay. What'd you do in school today? Nothing. Great. All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words, ich bin ein Berliner. There are many peoples in the world who really don't understand, or say they don't, what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world. Let them come to Berlin. John Fitzgerald Kennedy. What? So you and the president really are friends. Of course we are. We met at school… What's that supposed to mean? I was looking out my window last night, and I… And saw nothing. You saw absolutely nothing. Okay. Sorry. There are some things, Adam, that are private, and they should stay that way. Like your son? Who told you about my son? My parents. Your parents. Oh, my god. If you had a son, then you must have a husband, right? Ex-husband. What's he like? He's gone, that's what he's like. He was a little boy, just like you. I'm not a little boy. No, I don't suppose you are. Where are you going? As if that's any of your business. He won't talk to anyone at Langley, Catherine. Jack won't talk about it. He says it's over and done with. Perhaps you need to convince him that the conversation must remain open. He said that Bobby said… Oh, Christ. Bobby. Air support. That's all it was: Lack of air support. Well, it's always easy to second-guess a decision once it's been made. Especially when it's the wrong decision. We are talking about the man who in stood in front of the wall and mispronounced "Berliner." Ich bin ein Berliner: We are all jelly donuts. My god, can we talk about something else, please? It's Washington; what else is there to talk about? Life, maybe? Life? There is life outside of politics? Nothing outside of politics. Hmm. Catherine Caswell. And you should have seen him. He comes home covered in dirt. Like he was in bay of pigs. No, bay of pigs. Boy of pigs. The boy of pigs. Form is dead. Hey. Hey. We're going to our house, right? Yeah, right. Definitely. Hey, guys. Ready to go? Magda's going to come with us. That's okay, isn't it? Sure. I guess. Let's go. Cool house. What do your parents do? They're writers, journalists. My mom's a writer. Cookbooks. Cool. You guys just pretend I'm not here. I'm not here. What was that? It's kissing, stupid, French kissing. I went to France once. So you should know how to do this. Of course. Ow. What is that? It's my tooth. That is completely disgusting. I've got to go. My mom's gonna pick me up. Yeah, we better. Call me when you get that fixed. You broke your tooth, and you weren't gonna tell us about it? I glued it back in. You glued it? I thought it would be okay. This isn't a baby tooth, Adam. These don't grow back. I know that. Then why didn't you tell us? I don't know. What is wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me. What is that supposed to mean? Every day, you come home dirty after working in that woman's garden. You said… You spend all your time alone in your room. Because you… You don't talk to us anymore. It's your tooth, for god's sake. My tooth. My tooth. What was that? I have no idea. Well, I'll call the dentist in the morning. Society girls and Washington wives. Nero fiddles; Rome burns. Who the fuck are you? It isn't safe to ignore people in the dark, kid. You didn't answer my question. What? Do you like to sneak around? Is that what you like to do? Hmm? You like to watch? Hmm? You like to sneak around and watch? How about I throw you in jail? Hmm? Let other people watch you for a while. You can't put me in jail. Oh, no? You're not a cop. What makes you say that? You're drunk. Drunks come in all shapes and sizes, kid. Come on. So this is what a journey to a higher consciousness looks like. Hello, Graham. It's pathetic. Look at you. I found this peeping Tom outside. Hi, Adam. Hi. Oh, you know him. He's doing some work for me in the garden. In the garden. Looks like Vietnam, post-napalm. Don't you like it? No. Good. I think I'm gonna go. Why? It's nice to have a man around the house. What the fuck are you laughing at? What! Go on upstairs. I'll be up in a moment. What happened to you? Where did you go? I'm right here, Graham, just like always. You made a promise to me and Harris. You said you'd take care of us, even after he… We could've had another kid. We were still a family. People see you. It's not as if it's a secret: Going in and out of the white house. They see you, Catherine. Why do you care? You're my wife. Was! Was your wife. Everyone knows. And they laugh about it. And you know why? 'Cause you're not the only one, Catherine. He's got a string of women, and he fucks 'em all, every last one of 'em. You can't hurt me anymore, Graham. Not you, not your government, your precious agency. None of it can touch me. He was my son too. Was he? Tough day at the office? I've got Cubans running around south Florida and Louisiana just looking to shoot someone, idiots with guns. Well, I told you the anticommunist brigade wouldn't work. They all want back in on their own terms. Almost like a marriage gone bad, wouldn't you say? Almost. You trained her very well. She was an agency wife. Is she going to be a liability? She writes everything down… She always has… in her diary. I would've thought she'd been broken of that sort of habit. You try to break her; See how far you get. Mr. Del Valle, how are you? Every morning I wake up, I think of Fidel laughing at us, laughing and laughing behind his cohiba. It's not funny, though, is it? Casa Blanca playboy Kennedy, he laughs at us too. You know Mr. Caswell, of course. Yes, of course. We must act sooner rather than later. "Bay of pigs." Oh, boy. "What do the secret service agents think "while they're waiting outside while Jack and I swim? "He doesn't trust Lucian, not anymore. It's only Bobby now." You should have seen your face at lunch, Charlie. I was too worried about your hands under the table. You're in a hurry. Things to see; Places to go. People to do. Exactly. Ah, look at you. I didn't invite you over to look. So soon? Helene's making dinner, quail or something. I promised I'd be there. Give her my love. He read that Huxley book you suggested. Didn't like it. No surprises there. I could leave her, you know. For me? Don't bother. My quail needs work. Have a nice dinner. You left your book bag on the floor; Dead giveaway. Um, I'm sorry. There's no rain, so I'll just go home. Sit down. Never be ashamed of being excited, Adam. Just don't do it again. I won't. I saw your husband today. How exciting for you. He was with another guy in a dirty suit. They were talking about you. They met somebody, a guy with an accent. "Del" something. Del valle? Was that his name? Yeah, that's it. Who is he? He's a Cuban, a very angry Cuban. Some people think he's a patriot. Others think he's a criminal. I guess that would depend on your point of view. That's right. That's exactly right. You need to go now. See you tomorrow. Adam, if you see my husband again, go in the other direction. Oval office. This is Catherine Caswell. Can you put me through, please? One moment, please. I'm sorry, Mrs. Caswell, the president is indisposed. I'll wait. It may be some time. It's important. Well, I believe he'll be on the phone longer than you'll be willing to wait. May I take a message? No. No, no message. "Indisposed." Don't fuck this up, Jack. This is the night the Cuban prisoners finally came back from the bay of pigs. They flew into Miami after 20 months of captivity, finally freed by Fidel Castro for a ransom of $53 million in food and medicine. How will these returning prisoners be absorbed into the restless American Cuban community? Adam, hurry up; They'll be here any minute. Doofus. Walter's driving you. Walter? Jason's dad. We'll be home late, so just put yourself to bed. And if anyone, and I mean anyone, is drinking at this party, I want you out of there. Have Jason call his father. Okay, mom. And don't think I won't find out about it, mister, because I will. Clear? Clear. Bye, dad. Bye, son. Adam… Have fun. Jimmy, cut the shit. What? He's too scared to play. Am not. Just shut up and sit down. Ready? Adam, suit up and get ready. Adam… Here we go. Damn it, Jimmy. What? Such a buttwipe. Faith, one minute. 60 long seconds. Adam and faith. Adam and faith. Adam and faith. Adam and faith. Adam and faith. Adam and faith. Adam and faith. 60, 59, 58, 57, 56… French, right? Right. You got your tooth fixed. Yeah. I can tell. Adam. Faith. Adam Stafford is an asshole. Are you okay? I'm planting. I thought you said we had to wait till after the rain. After, during, whatever. You must be cold. You have no idea. Why is the music so loud? I was painting. I could hear it from across the street. Want one? Sure. You should go home. I want to paint with you. So let's paint. ♪ Why does the sun ♪ ♪ go on shining? ♪ ♪ Why does the sea ♪ ♪ rush to shore? ♪ ♪ Don't they… ♪ So what do you think? ♪ It's the end of the world ♪ 'cause you don't love me ♪ ♪ anymore ♪ Not bad. ♪ Why do the birds ♪ ♪ go on singing? ♪ Not bad.

Texas for Thanksgiving? I have to. If I don't go, then I'm not gonna get a raise. You know they like it when you're out there… Doing things. I know, Mike. It's just… Adam is… I can't do it alone. And Texas… I mean, Dallas is a shithole. It'll just be for a few days. And I will try to make it home for Thanksgiving supper. Well, I'm gonna go wake him up. He sleeps like the dead these days. His hormones probably sent him through the roof at that party last night. Adam, time to get… Mike. Mike, get up here. Look at this. Hi, dad. What am I supposed to do about this? What? It's not that big of a deal, mom. You have paint all over you! In the shower, right now. And do not come out till every speck of paint is gone. And then… then we will discuss cleaning your room. Mm-Kay, mom. Now! It's that woman, Catherine Caswell. This has got to stop, Mike. This has got to stop. All right, I'll talk to her this afternoon. You will talk to her now, right now. Addie… Now. All right, just, I'm gonna go finish the… Now! Hello. Hi, I'm… Mike Stafford with the star, no? I quite enjoyed your last piece on Dr. King, though you didn't exactly seem sympathetic, did you? Carver, Lucian carver. The Lucian carver? Fame is fleeting, but in Washington, we take what we can get. Won't you come in? Please. Little early for company, isn't it, Lucian? Best behavior, my dear. This is your neighbor, Mike Stafford. Drink. Uh, it's a little early. Should he have a drink, Catherine? It's my house, Michael. Have a drink. Vodka. Rocks. Jesus, Lucian, don't play with him. Just give him the drink. How's the boy? Boy? Your son, Adam. How is he? Uh, he's… he's fine. He's great. The usual. Good. Good. It's what we all work for, isn't it? The children. The future. I suppose so. How was your childhood, Lucian? Somehow, I don't see you laughing and playing in the meadows. Oh. It was fine. Great. The usual. Mike, is this a social visit or did you actually want something? No. Uh, yes, actually, it has to do with Adam. And my wife, she worries, maybe too much. But she worries about how much time he's been spending over here, and he's starting to neglect his schoolwork. And the thing with the paint this morning… If your wife wants him to stop working for me, then consider it done. Simple as that. Simple as that. Sure was a pleasure to met you, Mike. I'll be looking forward to your next piece. Yes, great. Thanks. Have fun in Texas. Nice to meet you both. You didn't have to scare him. I suppose not. But you enjoyed it. There are some perquisites that come with the job. That I do admit. Scaring people? Forcing them to do things they don't want to do? Sometimes what seems like the worst choice is actually the best. There's nothing I can do, Lucian. Catherine, your friend Jack won't talk to me, won't, in fact, talk to anyone inside the agency. You're our only connection to the oval office. And he's made it abundantly clear: No talking, no fucking, no nothing; It's over. I need to warn him. About what? The situation is very fluid. If he refuses to deal with Cuba, then Cuba is going to deal with him. What's that supposed to mean? There is pressure on me to… He could be in danger. He's the president, for god's sake. He's a man, and men make mistakes which they have to own up to and correct. Things have to change, Catherine, or else things will really change. It's all a game of chess, isn't it? Playing out the pawns in your head. Should I sacrifice the rook or the king? Will you sacrifice me? Catherine, I'm your son's godfather. My son is dead. Where does that leave you? He was a lovely boy. Graham was… get up. This is Catherine Caswell. Is he… No, no message. Carver. Lucian carver. Adrienne, he knew Adam's name. He knew what I've been writing. He knew I'm going to Texas. And he's with the CIA? Yeah, he's with the CIA the way that Stalin was with the communist party. Special ops, Castro, lumumba, all of it. So what's for breakfast? Sit your ass down. Dad, I… sit! Okay, number one, you're gonna have no more contact with that Caswell woman, none, zero, zilch, ever. Dad… Number two, you're grounded. Why? Because I said so. And number three, while I'm gone, your mother's gonna be working from home, and you are gonna be in school or you're gonna be here, nowhere else, clear? What happened? School, here; Nowhere else. Clear? Clear. Eggs okay? Eggs it is. May I help you, ma'am? Catherine Caswell. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, Mrs. Caswell. The personal list. I'm sure I'm there. I'm sorry, Mrs. Caswell. It… it doesn't appear to be there anymore. Would you take a bullet? Ma'am? For the president. Would you take a bullet? I'm a soldier, ma'am. Just following orders? Doing your duty? Yes, ma'am. Fuck do you want? Nothing. My ball. You got your ball, right? Right. At the airport in Dallas, the… And throughout the streets of Dallas, the Dallas police have been augmented by some 400 policemen called in on their day off, because there were some fears and concerns in Dallas that… That there might be demonstrations, at least, that could embarrass the president, because it was only on October 24th that our ambassador of the united nations, Adlai Stevenson, was assaulted in Dallas leaving a dinner meeting there. From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official: President Kennedy died at 1:00 P.M. central standard time, 2:00 eastern standard time, some 38 minutes ago. They killed him. They killed him. Vice president Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas, but we do not know to where he has proceeded. Presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly and become the 36th president of the United States. President Kennedy, at Dallas airport this morning, was cheerful and waving… Stop. The buds. You don't want to hurt them. November 22nd, and my garden is blossoming. Police have been looking for a white man approximately 30 years of age, 165 pounds, slender build. It seems that this man shot the president with a .30-.30 rifle. It's not my fault. Adam. Don't touch me. I'm sorry. Get out. Catherine, I… no. Get out, you little shit. Sometimes overshadowing the president himself. Mom? It's all right. Everything's gonna be fine. How bad was it? The motorcade came around the corner. The wind was blowing. People were talking. They were laughing, pointing. And then his head snapped back and forward. Jackie climbs out over the trunk like she's looking for something. And the cars drove away. God. I got to get back to the office. But you just got here ten minutes ago. Oswald hired a lawyer. I'll be there all night. It must have been horrible. Yeah, it was. At least it's over. Thank god for small favors. I'll see you, buddy. Oh, hello. I just was wondering if I might come in for a moment. No, I don't think so. I just wanted to make sure that Adam is all right. He's fine. I think he has something of mine. Well, I'll make sure to ask him. Okay. Upstairs. I just want… Now. I have to agree with you. Fuck the glass; Go straight for the bottle. Just leave me alone. I just wanted to check on you, make sure you're okay. Where did you find Ruby? Was he a friend of Del Valle's? A friend of yours? It's more complicated than that. Complicated? He's the president, and he's dead. Was. The president was. When I married you… You were the most idealist man I'd ever met, a man who was gonna change the world. You changed the world, all right. You lost every ideal you ever had. Times are different. Times are the same. You're different. I didn't lose my ideals, Catherine. I lost you. He wouldn't listen, not to anybody. I need the diary, Catherine. Need a little deniability, Graham? Point "A" leads to point "B" leads to a finger on the trigger? Just leave me alone. I'm an "ex": Ex-wife, ex-mother, ex-lover. If you don't give it to me… I'll talk. I'll break every rule in your little book. I'll talk about you and Lucian and Del valle. I'll put your fingers on that trigger. Lee Harvey Oswald is the only man with his finger on the trigger. Leave me alone, and it'll stay that way. Besides, I've earned it. That's not like you. You've got diaries going back to the third grade. What is like me, Graham? What am I like? Harris was… fuck you. It… it wasn't your fault. I… I lost you. But I want you back. We could go away… Start over, just the two of us, anywhere you want. I think I'd like that. But you must give Lucian the diary. I told you; I earned it. Talk to him, tell him, and then we'll go wherever you want. I'll think about it. Do. Do. I'm leaving. I fully expect never to see you again, and I hope the feeling's mutual. Where are you going? I'll be gone. Hmm. You won't have to worry about me anymore, agreed? The diary poses a problem. You can't shut up everyone, Lucian. I don't have to; Just the people who will talk. The diary is in a safe place. Leave me alone, and it will stay there. I just love a good mystery. I mean it, Lucian. I wonder where it could be; That's the question. No doubt a safe place. Who knows… You might even give it to someone. The safest place, a place I would never think to look. I wonder where that could be, who that could be. You wouldn't. Catherine, I would do anything I had to, anything at all. And to bring the point home, he stood before that horrible wall and declared to the world, "ich bin ein Berliner": We are all… Jelly donuts. Excuse me? "Berliner," he pronounced it wrong. He said, "we're all jelly donuts." Is that a joke? No, sister. Stand up. Come here. Hold out your hand. John F. Kennedy was the greatest president this country will ever know… Thwack! A catholic… Thwack! A man with a vision for the future. Thwack! I will not tolerate humor at his expense. I wasn't trying… thwack! A great man has been taken from us. Now go, and you pray. Thwack! Pray hard. Adam. What are you doing here? I told them I was your aunt. I need it back. What? What do you think? I'm sorry… Don't be sorry; Just give it back. It's at home. Bring it to me then, okay? After school, met me at the steps at 3:30, okay? Okay. I'm going away for a little while. Where? I don't know. India, maybe. Some place exotic and foreign where I can't understand the language. Why? Because I can't… Life about meaning, you know, finding the things in life that have meaning: Children, art, love. I don't have any of that anymore. You have me. I know I do. But sometimes one person isn't enough. You put all your desires and your dreams into them, and then they're gone. If I was older… Then you wouldn't be you. Hope… It's something that gets lost as you get older, and I need to find it again. Is that some sort of life lesson or something? Something like that. 3:30. The steps. Graham, it's me. I'll have it this afternoon. Graham, I'm happy we're going away. You're home early. So are you. Is everything okay, buddy? Why was he here? Who? The trench coat, that guy. Oh, he's an old friend of your mom's and mine. He… Where is it? What did he do with it? There are some things that don't make sense when you're a kid. She wants it back. I'm sure that she does. I said I'd give it back. When you're older, you'll understand. I am older. I do understand. Adam. You tell me the truth when it suits you. You lie to me for my own good? Catherine's never lied to me, not once. I'm sorry, Adam. You're my father. You're supposed to do the right thing for me. I did. Adam… That's mine. Actually, it's not. It's not yours either. You're absolutely right. Adam. Catherine's had a full life: Art, love, intrigue. Sometimes with a life like that, it's starts to get confusing. Catherine was confused. Her diary said that. Where is she? Isn't she waiting for you? Bobby said you were a fag. Good for him. Said you offered to suck his dick for a quarter. So? So what are you gonna do about it? He said you were gonna suck… You're the fag! Asshole. What?
