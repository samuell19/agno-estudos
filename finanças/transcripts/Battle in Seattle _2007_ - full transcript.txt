Shortly after the close of World War ll, 23 nations signed a general agreement on tariffs and trade, the GATT. Its purpose was to liberalize and expand world trade. Stability, a sense of global community: they were the key. For five decades, the GATT will grow, adding more members and becoming the World Trade Organization. We are writing the constitution for a single global economy. With over 150 member nations, the WTO controls 90 % of world trade. Unlike the GATT, the WTO can impose punishing fines on member countries that don't abide by its laws. Along with this expansion of free trade, the WTO avows to help developing countries benefit fully from the global trading system. It has very little to do with trade, and it's certainly not free. It's a system of global governance none of us voted for and none of us control. It simply means breaking down the borders of countries. So that large corporations will be free to operate anywhere without interference by governments or the people of these nations. And what they are saying is that money values should rule over life values, that human rights and the environment should be subordinated to the needs of commerce. The clean air rules were gutted. Cases of asthma increased. Genetically modified foods forced onto European consumers. Small-scale banana growers crushed by large corporations. Despite the problems and criticism, the WTO continues to grow, making it more powerful than ever. On the upcoming meeting in Seattle, dubbed the Millennium Round, new issues will be added to the WTO's existing rules. Imposing even tighter corporate control over more areas of our lives. To many, this meeting has become a battle for the future. All right, here, you take this, man. Jay, she's turtling. Shit. Hold it. Okay, you drop the rope. AH right, I'm coming to get you. It's all right. I got you. Not much of a last-minute replacement, am I? No, but you're better-looking than he was. Hey, don't get any ideas. I muat have checked everything three times. I never ended up like this before. That's Why you got to be a little crazy to take this gig. All right, you're good. Okay, you wait for my signal before we descend, all right? I'm Lou, by the way. Oh. Jay. We better get going before you're eating breakfast in jail. I don't plan on getting arrested until at least tomorrow. Fuck. - Close one. - Yeah, real smooth. All right, let's do it. Tomorrow, the World Trade Organization will meet in Seattle. It will be the largest meeting on global trade ever known... Jimmy Hoffa and the labor unions, along with environmentalists and human rights advocates, put together a rally at Memorial Stadium with an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 people. More than 50,000 protesters may be in the streets to demonstrate against the WTO. It's been 30 years since the Democratic convention riots in 1968 pitted police and protestors against each other. But some fear history will repeat itself this week in Seattle as the World Trade Organization prepares to hold its first ever ministerial meeting on U.S. soil. We have identified the subjects of our most recent surveillance photos, and they're not anarchists as we originally thought. All right, so we have a great team of lawyers that are pulling together to help us out on this. It's really important that you call this number. All right Jay! All right. Django Mills, arrested in four different countries for property damage involving whaling ships and shrimp trawlers. Louise Phillips: burned down her father's animal research lab, although she wasn't formally charged. She has been involved in Black Bloc demonstrations that have turned violent. Samantha Clayton." No criminal record, appears to have studied law, and was involved in the Sequoia Forest legal case back in '98. And last but not least, Jay Elgin. We got 13 major intersections downtown, and each of the affinity groups are gonna shut these areas down. Now, how are we gonna do it? Non violently. That's right, and by consensus. Jay's brother was killed in the Sequoia Forest demonstration. Hem! Hem! My brother's been hit. My brother's been hit! Get an ambulance! My brother's been hit. Don't arrest me! My brother's been hit! We need an ambulance! Since then, he's been involved in every major demonstration across the country, including getting himself arrested at the IMF in '98. We need a show of hands of those of you that are prepared to go to jail if need be. And don't feel bad if you're not. We need as many people on the outside as We can get. All right, people, well, opening ceremonies begin in about 24 hours, so please get ready 'cause we're gonna shut these motherfuckers down! All right? We set up two tripwire barricades around the Paramount Theatre. Now, we believe that all the protesters will be concentrated there. Now, to get through that, they're gonna have to climb fences, jump over Metro buses, at which point they'll be arrested. Well, make sure we're only arresting them there, okay? I want to keep this city's image clean. How many protesters are we expecting? Several thousand. Maybe 10,000. Are we ready for this? Quite sure of it. The WTO opening ceremonies are scheduled to take place at the Paramount Theatre downtown. Issues such as human rights, labor standards, and environmental protection are not on the formal agenda of the Seattle meeting, but with more than 20,000 WTO critics planning to march, It looks as though... What? That makes no sense to you? I'm just looking for a good story. Nothing irregular. Everything seems great. Looks like you're going to be having a very healthy baby four months from now. Ah. Have you chosen any names yet? No, not-not- not really. Yeah, well, there's a few we like, right? Yeah, she has a few she likes. I got to go, baby- Oh, no. Don't go now. I wish I didn't have to, but I'm running late as it is. I love you, baby. Come on, five more minutes. This protest is driving me crazy. It hasn't even started yet. Oh, come on. I'll call you. Doc, will you look after this woman? 'Cause she's made me very happy. I sure will. I'll see you. It's taken two years to bring the World Trade Organization to Seattle, and we did it. Nathan, you've arrived, safe and sound. May I present Nathan Abasi, one of the toughest negotiators in the Southern Hemisphere. I bet Mr. Dural was telling you I will be cutting agricultural resources. Along the way, the Emerald City has beaten out Detroit, Denver, Dallas, San Diego, and Honolulu. Oh, have you met Dr. Alex Mario? He's from Bosnia but works in Africa with Médecins Sans Frontiéres. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. He's here to raise awareness about cost of AIDS medications. Oh. Yeah. Well, I hope you have more luck at these talks than I usually do. I welcome all of you for what will be a productive and successful week. To success. Thank you. Thank you all. Well, I've just been to the WTO cocktail party... Where the hors d'oeuvres were much better but the music not so good. You may or may not know this, but I was once a protestor too during Vietnam, so I'm happy to have the demonstrator's voice be heard. In turn, I've been promised by numerous organizations that there will be no violence. If we stick to this plan, I believe we will achieve all that is hoped for. What I'm trying to say is, be tough on your issues, but be gentle on my town. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Six months' planning, here we go. What time is it? Don't know. That was nice last night. We should get going. What? Man, you are not much of a morning person, are you? You check the roster? [Don't think you can call in sick today. Heads up. Chief said there might be chemical or bio attacks today. My fucking chemicals right here. Oh, yeah? I think if there was gonna be chemical warfare, we'd have more than a couple hundred guys out there. How's Ella and the baby? Ah, great. Yeah, we went for the ultrasound yesterday, and you can see the whole little body and even down to the little fingers. And then you hear the heartbeat... Really fast, like the little guy was saying, "Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy." So how'd you get into this? - What are you, a cop? - Yeah. And if you don't answer my questions, I'm gonna handcuff you. When I was an animal activist, I used to think the strong prey on the weak. When I was an anarchist, I thought we could all be equal. - What about now? - I don't know. I'm just taking one long look at the enemy. What about you, hotshot? What's got your panties all in a bunch? My panties are in bunch because I want to make sure that everything runs smoothly and nobody gets hurt. Of course we're gonna get hurt. What do you think this is? Pretty tough, aren't you? Protests get me excited and depressed at the same time. I don't know what that makes me. Hey, we're gonna move in 15 minutes, Dale. We're not keeping you, are we? No, sir. - Good luck out there. - Luck? The only people that's gonna need luck is those fucking tree huggers. Give me your arm. Your number? It's a lawyer's number for when you're in jail. I thought you were gonna be my knight in shining armor. I think rescuing you on the crane was enough. All right, kids, enough small talk; come on. We got to get moving. Come on. I Oh, I, I, I am dreaming I I of a white Christmas I How'd it go yesterday? Oh, my God, you have to see this. - Let me see. - Look at that. Oh, my God. We are going shopping for baby clothes immediately. I don't even know what it is yet. Come on, you're five months pregnant, and you haven't bought any baby clothes. I'm just waiting, you know? So is it a boy or a girl? I don't want to know. Wow, is that a police badge I see? Ah, you're so funny. Anyway, I hate to break up this baby shower, but I need someone at the other register tout de suite. What is it with him and foreign languages? Congratulations. You look beautiful. You are the people. You are the power. And we're gonna show it today when we march. When we live under economic systems that want to divide us from each other, but we will not today be divided. All right, bring it in now. Come on, come on. Quick, quick, quick. They're over the barricade. Okay, they're moving, they're moving. GO, go: go' Go. Bring 'em in. Bring 'em in. Get it in there. Here they come. Here they come. Jay, we're set over here. Take care of yourself. Nobody out. Nobody in; nobody out. Nobody in; nobody out. Nobody in. Hey, Sam, we've taken the Paramount. How you holding up? Yeah. We're moving now. All right. See you later. Let's shut 'em down! Go, go, go! Move, move! Whose strength? Our strength. Whose strength? Our strength. Whose strength? Our strength. Whose strength? We have lockdown. I Civil unrest has begun to erupt in the global village I II II Jean. What's going on? The delegates can't get to the Paramount. What? Okay, let's go there. Nobody in; nobody out. I have to be inside, please. You go back to your hotel. I'm not WTO. WTO can help us. I'm sorry, man, we're gonna shut 'em down today. We were given assurance by we my that this would not happen. Sir, I have some news. It's not good. Just tell me what the hell is going on out there. Look at this place. Most of the delegates can't get to the conference. The protesters have seized the intersections outside. Weren't the police preventing that? Uh, no, sir. Well, why not? As you ordered, there were to be no arrests made outside of the barricades. Look, the police have been trying to secure safe passage for the delegates and the ambassadors but the protesters have cemented their arms together. What? They formed circles so that the only way you can separate them is by breaking their arms. Sir, the chief of police is on line one. Gordon, I thought you said they wouldn't get past the barricades. We got a lot bigger problems than that, Jim. Right now, they've captured the entire downtown core. There's so many of them out there, we couldn't arrest them all even if we wanted to. I thought they were nonviolent. They're not being violent. All right, what are we gonna do? I have called every patrol in the state. We even called the fire department to hose down the protesters, but they refused. What are the options then? There's only one option left. Gordon... lam not gonna start gassing people, do you hear me? I gave the protesters my word. The press would have a field day with me. Uh, Jim, I think we're past having that choice. Sir, the White House is on line two. All right, I'll get it. All right. Just do whatever you have to do, and just do it fast. Nervous, Johnson? Nervous? What, are you fucking kidding me, man? I put on all this shit; It's like I'm fucking invincible, bitch. Yeah, I used to feel that way when I was a toddler. We got some new orders, so listen up. We're going to the Paramount Theatre, and orders are to use disbursement techniques. No arrests are to be made. Understood? Wait, wait. So you're saying if a protester is breaking the law, I'm supposed to, what, just stand there and watch 'em? That's right, Johnson. That's coming from the top. We're gonna be there in five, so refs be ready. Can you tell me the reason why you're here today? Well, basically, the Endangered Species Act requires that shrimp trawlers place special devices on their boats to prevent the killing of sea turtles. Now, the WTO, they come along, and they say, "Well, these devices are somehow illegal..." Well, we all love turtles, but don't you think there are more important problems in the world that need to be addressed? If you feel that a ruling that threatens an endangered species is any different from, say, millions of working-class jobs being outsourced or the quality of our environment or our food getting worse, you’re just not connecting the dots. Do you think a few signs and some catchy slogans are going to somehow stop global trade? Well, see, we have no problem with so-called free trade as long as it's not at the expense of our human values. Yes? Because of the WTO's legally binding laws... Thank you so much. That was great. Michael, let's roll. Pine and Fifth. Good luck, man. Put your head back. Put your head back. It hurts, man. It burns. Put your head back. Come on, come on. Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Come on. Tilt your head back. Okay, everyone, this is what I've heard. There are protesters at the end of Sixth Avenue, so you'll be let out right in the middle of the protest, okay? Now, I've called and asked for immediate updates. They said, "Just relax. Have lunch." WTO Director-General Michael Moore says an effort to launch a new round of global trade talks... 207, please. Has not been derailed. This conference will be a success. Indeed, it's doomed to succeed. It is our biggest chance to provide the conditions for the next century's trading regime. Can I get water and whiskey, please? Absolutely. Shut 'em down! II What? Sir, Hoffa Jr.'s agreed. Ah. Uh, uh, sir... Governor? Yeah, I've got some good news. The White House is giving Labor a seat at the negotiating table. They won't be joining the protest downtown. Well, that's a bonus, but we have other problems. I have the Secret Service all over me, and they're saying action must be taken immediately. Look, I'm under extreme pressure here to call in the Guard now. The protesters are nonviolent. You bring in the National Guard, the whole community's gonna become alarmed. Jim, I have the Secretary of State confined to a hotel... I have the While House pressuring me to call a state of emergency. I understand that, but right now, we simply cannot do that. They'll clash with the entire Labor march. And that?! Make our problems now seem like a walk in the park. We cannot call in the National Guard now. Are you prepared to handle this? Because we have a potential catastrophe on our hands. Just-John, John, listen, please, okay? Just give the police some time. They'll be effective. Just give me a few more hours. Okay, I'm giving you two hours, and that's it. - Sir? - What? The WTO ceremonies have just been cancelled, so... Okay. Oh, my God. Yes! It worked! It worked! There were so many people. Where did all these people come from? It was like a Thriller video. I mean, they were coming out the garbage can, out of the ground. Welcome to the first internet protest in history. Think Labor's ready to join this party'? Come on, Labor. Hey, give me that. Don't go that way. We need you downtown. That's what we were told to do, and that's what we're doing. The man who's chopping down the redwoods is the same guy who's destroying your workers' rights. We're fighting for the same thing. Teamsters and turtles together. We need you. Teamsters and turtles together. Teamsters and turtles together. Teamsters and turtles together. Gordon, what's going on? Are we making any progress out there? We just got reports back our boys are seeing Labor marches all over downtown. Away from the designated march route? Well, how the hell did that happen? We don't know yet. What do you mean you don't know? Labor promised to march back to Memorial Stadium. I know. Just find out what's going on, will ya? The demonstration caused the cancellation of the conference's opening ceremonies, but The plenary session, the real business meeting of the conference... Fuck! Got under way almost on time. The TV crew's pulled out. They said they were covering the protests. Aw, you should just get pregnant. Come on, we always said we'd do it together. Then I better find a good sperm bank. Well, you better hurry up. I'm five months ahead of you. I do have something a little different in mind. - Lambada, anyone? - No. Oh, yeah, the forbidden dance? Dale and I were gonna go to Brazil. You never told me that. Yeah; three days after his dad died, he came back from some park he had been to and said, "Let's just quit our jobs. Let's go traveling." He even started buying guidebooks. Two weeks later, I found out I was pregnant, Dale got promoted, and we just never talked about it again. I just wish that it was better timing, you know'? There's never a good time; you just do it, and it's right. I just-l feel like my life is being shuffled into this next phase, and I-l don't feel quite ready for it. I mean, I don't want the cover of some brochure magazine to be the closest thing we ever get to adventure. You want adventure? You just signed up for the biggest adventure of all. It's gonna be great. You'll see. Maybe I will go visit a sperm bank. But if you're going there, you don't have to. Ooh, that would be better, wouldn't it? What are you doing? This woman is pregnant. Oh, yeah? You're gonna have a kid? Yeah. Would you want your kid to work to death in a sweatshop making baby clothes? Of course not. Then don't fucking shop here! What the hell's going on out there? What the fuck? I know we asked you not to do this shit today. I didn't promise you anything. I didn't get in your way, so you stay out of mine. Our message is just as valid as yours. Take the fucking mask off and join the rest of us. Are you fucking kidding me? Are you a fucking moron, man? You're ruining everything we've worked for. Now, we stopped them today. And what about tomorrow? And frankly, I don't give a fuck what it is you accomplished today. I'm not just gonna lay down and say, "Peace and love," and, "Can I stick a flower in the barrel of your machine gun, piggy?" The streets of Seattle have descended into chaos as violent demonstrators are smashing shop windows. You understand me? What the hell are we waiting on? This is a nonviolent protest. And that's not violent! Do you see anybody getting hurt? We attack corporate America. That's not the point! The media's feasting on this. Exactly. We are the ones making this day famous. Are you blind? You're feeding them. You're giving them exactly what they want. You call that anarchy? You're just pissed 'cause you're not getting enough attention, sweetheart. - Ah! - No! Nonviolence, huh? Fuck you! - Stop! Get off of me! - Stop, Lou. - What do you know, huh? You're just trying to run this show without even getting your hands dirty. Look, you know nothing about me. I've been around men like you my whole life. You're a fucking coward, Jay. Lou. - Fuck off. - Lou! Excuse me. Why do you believe violence is the best way to get your message across? Oh, you want to know my message? I want to you to stop spreading corporate-controlled disinformation around the globe and start covering the real issues, like why this fucking world is being raped by guys that make $500 million a year while the rest of the world starves. Why don't you put that on the 9:00 news? And we're cut. Do you want me to keep the tape? What do you think? They breaking shit, and we're running from civilians. Supp|y's almost out of teargas; we need to regroup. Regroup or not, this is a bad message to send, man. We look fucking useless. If you want to be useful, Johnson, you can be the one to resupply the gas. Now, we got a van heading upstate to restock. Don't smile at me, boy. Now, go get changed and bring your civilian clothes. I don't want to hear any more lip. We got to move and move fast; we got a problem a block down. Let's go! Come on. I Where those treetops glisten I I And children listen I I To hear sleigh bells in the snow I I The snow I I Then l, l, I am dreaming of a white Christmas I I With every Christmas card I write I I Do-do, do-do-do I May your days, may your days, may your days I Be merry and bright I I And may all your Christmases be white I You asked for a few hours, and I gave it to you. And they've remained nonviolent. Nonviolent does not mean law-abiding. If we had called in the National Guard when I requested, Seattle wouldn't be in every goddamn newspaper around the globe. We got taken by surprise, Jim. Now it's time to take control back. The National Guard won't be here until tomorrow. And that is why calling a state of emergency and imposing a curfew is our only option. Are you out of your mind? You're gonna turn downtown into a war zone. Have you been outside lately? It looks like Beirut! In 12 hours, the president of the United States is gonna be landing here. He has already called and threatened to cancel, and that is not gonna happen. Do you understand? His arrival will signal a return to normalcy, right? Are we agreed? And then the window just— it just- it just smashed behind us. It was terrifying. I mean, I'm still shaken up by it. Do you smell that? Whatever that is, it's not natural. God. - Can you taste that? - Yes. Hey. Hey, sweetheart, where are you? I'm at work. Look, I want you to go home now. It's getting crazy downtown. Get out now, okay? Okay. Okay, well, we'll get there- Ella. Dale, I got to call you back. Are you okay? Ella, Karla, we have to- - Are you all right? - Yeah. Okay, just take a breath. Due to the street protests, we are closing the store immediately. All customers must vacate the premises now. Thank you. Close it up here, okay? Providing medical care, dean Water, and food, Doctors Without Borders makes the difference... We're gonna need to reschedule the presentation. No one's coming because of the riots. I'm sorry. In Sudan, more than a million have faced famine caused by civil war and drought. Ifs a crisis situation at the moment- The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. Do you know where the next move is in the city? Afternoon. It is my unfortunate duty today to have to tell you that I am authorizing the use of the National Guard. I am also- I'm also declaring a state of emergency in Seattle from this moment forth. There will be a curfew imposed from 7:00 p.m. tonight until 7:30 a.m. tomorrow morning in downtown Seattle. These actions are unavoidable in light of recent property destruction. Yes. Mr. Mayor, there have been rumors that you knew what to expect and yet you were still unprepared for today's events. - We had full- - Can you comment? We had full knowledge of the protester's aims and decided that freedom of speech and the right to assembly would be celebrated today. Mr. Mayor. Why wasn't the National Guard called in earlier? We believed that a show of force would make the circumstances worse. We did not want to present Seattle with the face of an armed camp as the WTO did its work. Any comment on police violence and retaliation? Some of the protesters chose to be unlawful. The police responded appropriately. Thank you. Mr. Mayor, isn't declaring Martial Law and keeping the protesters in violation of the First Amendment rights? Halt. We are ordering you to immediately disperse. Otherwise, you'd be the subject of chemical and pain compliance. Comply immediately. We are peaceful protestors exercising free speech. We ask that you do not take away our constitutional rights. Chemical disbursement... We are peaceful protestors exercising... You have ten minutes to comply. II We need two more, and I gm 'em. II Power, power, power to the people. Hey, man, can you hold this up for me? No, no, no, I can't- II There's no buses and all the cabs are on strike, lady. Well, how are you supposed to get home? Hey, Gabby. Hey, do you mind if I stop by your place for a while? Get the gas ready. Peaceful protest. This is your final warning. Stand by. Be all right? Yeah. Take this for me. Thank you. Here, put this on. Do you have one? Do you have one? No, no, I'm all right. I got a- I got a tough shell. All right, people, this is it. Peaceful protest. Fire canisters. This is what democracy looks like. That is what a police state looks like. You got to get out of the way, lady. This is what democracy looks like. That is what a police state looks like. Power, power, power to the people. Power to the people. Power, power, power, power. Power to the people. Power to the people. Power, power, power, power. Power to the people. Deploy- Sam. I am a peaceful protester. I am a peaceful pro- - What? - Fuck! Mike, let's go. - You want to go out there? - Let's go! Shit. Come on. Ready? The whole world is watching. I am watching a completely unprovoked attack by police here in downtown Seattle. Oh, God. Somebody help me! Oh, my God, Cole. Take that. My baby! My God, what happened? What happened? My baby. Oh, my God, my baby. Michael! Michael! Michael! Help! Help] II How are you guys? I'm on the job. - Hold up. Hold up. - I'm on the job. Guys, guys, let him through. Are you all right? Where you been? We got restocked hours ago. What happened to your face? It's a long story. Ah, what the fuck is this shit. Careful. We've been using that as a porta potty. There's some bottles you don't want to knock over. Ah, these bottles, that's great. And bullshit. We haven't had a break or food since we woke up. I'm sick of this. Oh, incoming. What? They've been looking for you. Dale. Yeah? Your wife's in the hospital. Let's go ahead and prep trauma one and two. The group just continued destroying property, vandalizing cars, creating havoc. The police were nowhere to be found. About an hour after that, the group was back in action... But for us to have to close our stores during the peak season, the holiday Christmas season just beginning, really is an injustice. They're breaking the bank's windows here at U.S. Bank. We got to get out of here... A group we now know as Anarchist... The battle in Seattle turns into a war. Jesus Christ. Battle in Seattle? It sounds like a monster truck show. They turned us into icons of violence. Well, what do you expect? What did I expect? I mean, eight corporations own half the U.S. media. You know that. Then what the fuck are we doing this for? I'm sorry. Jay, please. If you want to leave again, then just leave. That's not fair. This is hard for me. We shut them down, and look what they did to us. We failed, Jay. You only fail when you quit. Oh, fuck you. I wanted justice for your brother as much as you did, but we never would have won that case. Oh, how would you know? You gave up on it. I gave up because I knew we didn't stand a chance. Oh, like now. Yeah. Okay, you're right. Okay, maybe we wouldn't have won back then, but we still have a chance now, okay? And I understand; if you don't to protest, you don't want to be part of the legal team, that's fine, but maybe you could be a medic. Look, I- I know you want to make a difference. Yeah, I do. But how do you stop those who will stop at nothing? You don't stop. Who brought my wife in? She's right over there, sir. Excuse me. You came in with my wife, Ella. - Yes. - What happened? She was attacked by police. Thank you. Ella. Hi. How are you? What happened? What? Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. - It's okay. - Baby. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay now. Get off me. It's me, baby. It's me. Get off of me. Baby? Dale, don't. Yesterday, the protest spotlight was supposed to have been on Labor and its critique of the WTO, but by the time the Labor march was ending, the confrontations on the street were heating up, and Labor's message was all but drowned out. Last night, in an effort to finally clear the streets... Why more arrests weren't made. Many protesters had trained in civil disobedience, expecting, some even hoping, they would be arrested. Seattle police chief said last night that he had never been more proud of his officers, and he defended their actions. Our police officers, in my judgment, did an extraordinary job today against all odds. All right, something tells me they're not gonna be as friendly as they were yesterday. You look like you're going somewhere. So do you. Jay. Yo. This'll get you in. Knock 'em dead, champ. Come on. - All right. - Bad tie. I'll give it to you when I get back. Good luck. I need more tear gas. Yesterday, we ran out in four hours. I don't care what they say downtown, all right? Lieutenant, do you have a moment? Yeah. Yeah, sure, Dale. Ah, sir, I need to request permission to go home. I-I need to be with my wife today. Yeah, Dale, look, I heard about what happened with your wife. I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time for you, but I need you out on the street. Sir, I am not right to go out there today. No, no, every man is important out there. Look, when this thing's over, I'll give you off all the time you want. Okay? Patients are dying not because their diseases are incurable, but because, as consumers, they do not provide a viable market for pharmaceutical products. I believe the WTO must review its TRIPS agreements so that public health comes before commercial interests. It is vital to the survival of millions of people. Thank you. I'm sure we all agree that Doctors Without Borders have done many great things. However, on the issue of patents, we believe they're a little misguided. Who's that? It's Mark Harrington. He's a major lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry. Many of these nations are embroiled in bloody civil wars. Let's go. They lack the basic infrastructures, such as clean water and sewage treatment. Now, it is these that lead inevitably to a health crisis no matter how much medicine is made available to them. Doctor, your industry as well as ours is dedicated to maintaining and preserving health. Thank you. Uh, excuse- Um, excu— Excuse me. I just wanted to congratulate the WTO and particularly congratulate Mr. Lovitz there. It's because of Mr. Lovitz and the WTO's effort at eliminating trade tariffs on lumber products that two million acres of forest are being destroyed and cut down, and on top of that, irreplaceable trees are being turned into profit by people like you. And I want you to know, Mr. Lovitz, that my brother's blood is on your hands. It's on your hands, you motherfucker. You fucking murderer. Help! My brother's been hurt. My brother's been hurt. You murdered my brother. My bro river's been- Call an ambulance! Ain‘t no power like the power of the people, 'cause the power of the people don't stop; say what? Ain't no power like the power of the people, 'cause the power of the people don't stop; say what? Ain't no power like the power of the people, 'cause the power of the people don't stop; say what? Ain't no power like the power of the people, 'cause the power of the people don't stop; say what? Ain't no power like the power of the people, 'cause the power of the people don't stop; say what? Ain't no power like the power of the people, 'cause the power of the people don't stop; say what? Ain't no power like the power of the people, 'cause the power of the people don't stop; say what? Do you ever wonder what those horses feel like about teargas and all that type of stuff? They don't give them no mask. No, but I do wonder how you stay so upbeat all the time. Animals, working with animals instead of humans. Way healthier. Next time we save some turtles, you should come along with us. - I think I'd like that. - Yeah. Why turtles? When I was a little kid, my grandfather, he told me this cool story about how all the animals, you know, they made fun of this one little turtle because he was different. You know, he couldn't defend hisself, so of course, they picked on him. But being he was a turtle, he was smart. So he developed this hard shell, and that only made the animals mad, so they picked him up, threw him in the river, and then he broke his shell into, like, a dozen pieces. Poor turtle. Yeah, they got him good, but he was tough. You know, he picked hisself back up; put himself back together. And even though, you know, this time his shell was cracked, it was stronger than ever, and that's why turtles have such beautiful patterns on their shells. And then what happened? Well, because of the WTO, they made him into an ashtray. That's fucked up, Django. Yeah. Fucked-up world. Wait, so let me get this straight. Yesterday, we're not supposed to arrest anybody and today we're supposed to arrest everybody. Johnson, order them to disperse. If they don't, arrest them. Understand? Get in a line. Let's go. Peaceful protest. Peaceful protest. Da!e. Hey. Baby, it's me. Listen, I just wanted to say... I don't know what to say. Dale, get off the phone. Come on. Let's go. Uh, I got to go. I just-l- I'll try to call you later. I love you, baby. I.. The story is a lot bigger than a few people dressed in black breaking windows. Eric, the news is right here. I'm telling you. Listen to me, Eric. Just listen to me. No, you listen, Jean. In one hour, Clinton's giving a press conference. You are going live. You screw this up, and we are gonna have major problems. - Got it? - Got it. Asshole. What do you want to do? Let's just stick around a little bit. Fuckin' asshole. Peaceful protest. Peaceful protest. Peaceful protest. Peaceful protest. Peaceful protest. Peaceful protest. Peaceful protest. Peaceful protest. This is your first and last warning. I need you to disperse. Just stand up and leave. Otherwise we will force you to leave. I'm not gonna say it again. We need you to stand up and leave. Stand by. Peaceful protest. Deploy. Get your knee off my neck. I am not resisting. I am a nonviolent protester. I am a nonviolent protester. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. II How the hell do they keep doing it? What? How do they keep on putting themselves on the line like that for a cause they can't win? 'Cause they believe they can win. Stop the van. Jean, the Clinton conference is in, like, five minutes. Michael, I need you to forget about the Clinton thing. And forget about the live broadcast? No. We're still going live. You know what that'll mean, right? President Clinton had arrived at Boeing Field in the middle of the night. We now know the Secret Service considered canceling the visit until they got assurances the president would be safe. Coming up, we have Jean Asbury reporting live from the president's press conference. Jean. We're set up and ready to go. Are you sure you want to do this? They want to keep the truth gagged? So be it. Jean. We're going live to the battle in Seattle with Jean on the scene. What the fuck does she think she's doing? Cut the transmission, and go to the studio. What? Right now? - Now! - Jim, you're on. Well, that was Jean Asbury there in Seattle showing us the tactics that protesters are resorting to. We'll be right back after this break. I just, uh, want to say... Thanks. Yeah, she's gonna have to call you back. II The creation of this African Caucus group is essential if we are to maintain... A united voice against industrialized nations. What's going on? What's happening? Where are you going? I'm sorry, Mr. Abasi, but, due to an unscheduled Labor meeting, we need all available interpreters. An unscheduled meeting takes precedence over us? As host, we do reserve the right to determine how our resources are allocated. We can arrange for interpreters to be here some other time. And I will accept lots of criticisms about the WTO and how we can improve what we do. But one criticism I will not accept, and that is that this house in some way is not democratic. There are ministers from all over the world assembled. There are ministers who are appointed by their presidents or elected by their parliaments. 90 % of all death and suffering from infectious disease occurs in the Third World. I'm sorry, I have to- 14 million people die every year. So many could be saved if medicines were cheaper, but they are simply too expensive for developing nations to afford due to patent protection laws. Stop. Please stop. Don't you have children? How would you feel if your child was sick, you knew there was a cure, but you couldn't afford it, so you must stand by and watch your child die? You people, right here... You have a power to make a difference. Isn't it time that people mattered more than profit? I Here's a little song I wrote I I Everybody, sing it note for note I I Don't worry I I Be happy I I Don't worry, be happy now I I Dooo-doo-doo-do-do I Come on, y'all. I mean, this ain't the end of the world. We're just getting locked up. Well, at least, it ain't the end of the world yet. You're being way too quiet on me. Something happened with you and Jay, right? What do you mean? Oh, you know, Django know. You know, I see everything. I saw that little look he gave you. What look? "What look." You know, that look. I mean, I ain't seen him give that look in a long time. I didn't see no look. Okay, well, okay, I ain't seen no wok either. You know, maybe it was just, you know, the tear gas and all that type of stuff messing my eyes UP- Then he almost gets arrested trying to save you and Sam, and that ain't cool; he cannot get locked up. God forbid. Hell, yeah. I mean, I like making fun of him too much to see him gone. What do you mean, "gone"? They got two strikes against him. He get one more, he is out of here. I mean, for life; no joke. Didn't he tell you? No, he didn't. Ah, yeah. I mean, '98, IMF; '97, the whole forest thing. The boy got some nuts on him, though, even if they are organic nuts. They some nuts. Come on, y'all. Tough crowd. Forced from downtown by police as curfew descends, an angry crowd of demonstrators mixed with residents are near Broadway and Pine Street. Go home to your wife, to your kids. Police patience finally runs out. The battle for Capitol Hill begins. Police retake Capitol Hill, but some say amid the tear gas and rubber bullets, they have lost credibility. For many, the violent climax of the battle for Capitol Hill is the last straw. Be ready for a long vacation. This is not a police state! The last group was pushed past the Paramount Theatre, up Pine Street, all the way to Capitol Hill. - Fuck, man. - What the hell? Son of a bitch. Shit, man. They put piss in it. Go home! They put fucking- Get up there, all right? You can shower later. Get up there now. Son of a bitch! Stand back. Where the fuck is everybody? Haven't you done enough? You're the ones making this violent. This was a peaceful protest. Yeah, come on! Stand back! Why are you so proud of yourself? Come on, you fucking cowards. Oh, you think you're so brave now that there's only six of you? Dale, what you doing, man? We got to wait for backup. I'm doing my job. Come on. He's just a kid. Would you shoot your own kid? Huh? Would you should your own kid or use a fucking nightstick? Huh? Take this. What? Dale, what the fuck are you doing? Hey! Hey, hey, I'm not in service. What? Open the fucking door. Son of a bitch! II Hey, get off him. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Hey, look at me. It's over. Let it go. Hey, you all right? Come here. Look at me. Look at me. Oh, fuck. Just lay there for a second. Please, don't arrest- Don't arrest me. Can you walk? Don't arrest me. Don't arrest me. Come on, man, get up. Come on. Get up. No, please. Put your hands behind your back, please. Oh, no. I'm begging you. All right. We got 'em. Where's everybody going? There are hundreds of us in jail. What about them? This isn't over yet. You can't just leave them there. We can't leave them there to rot. And what are we supposed to do? Look, I'm gonna have to get a fucking hamburger. Every one of our lawyers are in here? That's what I heard. Who's gonna get us out? Anybody hear anything about Jay? Nobody's seen or heard from him. Until they let us talk with somebody on the outside, we have no idea what we're dealing with. All jewelry, your wallet. I'm gonna need the cigarettes and the phone too. All personal belongings must be handed in. Let's go. Take it easy man I'm- Shut up! Step to your right. What the fuck you looking at? Excuse me, can I make a phone call? No. Sit down. Look, I have the number right here. Do you understand what "no" means? One call. When you decide to give us your name, then we'll give you your rights. Jay? Jay? Jay! What the fuck have you done to him? You fricking pigs! Is that what happens when you exercise your civil liberties .7 Miss Clayton .7 The mayor will see you now. Have a seat. It's a big responsibility you have, handling, what is it, 600 people? 600 innocent people, Mr. Mayor. I'll be the first to admit that mistakes were made, but those protesters are in jail because they broke the law. You and I both know you're incarcerating people who will never stand trial. This is a file of many of the known protesters who are in jail. If they agree that for two years they won't demonstrate, they'll be released immediately. They'll never agree to having their civil liberties taken away any more than they already have been. Neither will I, Mr. Mayor. Well, I think you should give them the choice, don't you, considering the consequences? Which are exactly? Your clients are in a precarious situation, especially those with criminal records. First of all, court rules have been violated by not providing prisoners with access to counsel. Second, access to counsel is not contingent on answering police questions, including, "What is your name?" And lastly, you don't have the resources to provide a jury and a public defender to everyone in that jail, so let's not bother bluffing anymore. I want my clients freed with no fines, no restitution orders, and no criminal charges. It's hard to help your clients if they won't talk. Well, their voices must have been taken away when their rights were. Okay. I want to see the prisoners now. Well, I suggest you come back in a couple of days when it's quieter. Thank you. Let them go! Doesn't look like it's gonna get much quieter... Especially for you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Ella? Dale's on the phone again. Ella? Just tell him I'll be back in a couple of days. Jay? Jay, are you okay? Guess I'm not gonna be able to rescue you after all. Yeah. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I didn't know. What? It's okay. Hey, hey. I didn't know you had it in you too. What? That voice. The one that tells you that if you don't stand up and fight, everything that's beautiful is gonna be taken away. I just want to run away. Oh. I'm so sorry. Hey. Hey. Lou, give me your hand. You all right? Yeah, I'm okay. You're crying like a girl. Come on, tough girl. We Want you to know... We Want you to know... You are not alone. You are not alone. People are protesting with us... People are protesting with us... In 30 cities across the world. In 30 cities across the world! We'll all stay with you... We'll all stand with you... Until you're released. Until you're released. The people united will never be divided. The people united will never be divided. The people united... There they are. United will never be divided. The people united will never be divided. The people united will never be divided. The people united will never be divided. The people united will never be divided. Don't stop. Say what? Ain't no power like the power of the people 'cause the power of the people don't stop; say what? Ain't no power like the power of the people 'cause the power of the people don't stop. I'm sorry, sir. I think you want to turn on the TV, Channel 7. And huge protest crowds stiff growing at the-jail are creating... How you doing? I came to apologize. I was way out of line. My wife and I lost our baby. I know that's no excuse, but I just-that's- I'm really sorry. Really, really, really sorry. And so... I don't blame you. I mean, I do, but... Shit, you're not the problem. I mean, you're just doing your job, I guess. And the people that I'm really trying to fight, you know, are the ones that destroy so much... And they hurt so many lives. I'm not just one. There are literally millions, and nobody ever points a gun at them. You know, they just seem so unaccountable... Untouchable. It just seems kind of fucked that you're... You and me are the ones that have to fight each other. At least 1,000 protesters marched and sang. Ain't no power like the power of the people 'cause the power of the people don't stop. Sir. The Labor Council is threatening a general strike if the jailed protesters aren't released. General strike? Yes, sir. The protesters are demanding the release of 500 or so protesters behind bars. Let them go. Let them go. Tell me I'm hallucinating. You are not here right now. You all right? We'll get out of here. Don't-don't worry- don't worry. We'll get out of here. What? What? What Django always say? Don't, man. Come on. What does Django always say? Don't. Slow and steady wins the race every time. What the fuck have we won, Django? Have a look around you, man. Look, I know it's hard right now, but you got to- you got to stick with it, man. I mean, your brother's up there rooting for you, rooting for all of us. Come on, man. I mean, besides, a week ago, nobody knew what the hell the WTO was. Now they still don't know what the WTO is, but... At least they know it's bad, you know? Yes. How long have we been trying to save this planet? Ah... Not long enough. Yeah, it's still quite a mess, huh? Oh, yeah. II I love you. At the beginning of this week, we came here with hope in our hearts to try and find better solutions for our countries. We were promised these rounds would be different from the last time, that our trade concerns would be heard. But we have been treated like no more than animals. The manipulation of third-world countries is simply another form of colonialism. You may try to silence me, but I will have my say. Like the protesters outside of this building, I will be heard! We have been blindsided and marginalized on issues of vital importance. Transparency and openness have not existed here. Therefore, we will not join the consensus required to meet the objectives of this conference. No more will we stand idly by as our countries are abused and exploited! The people united will never be defeated. The people united will never be defeated. Everybody on the inside... Everybody on the inside... We have two messages for you... We have two messages for you... That we think you're gonna like. That we think you're gonna like. The first message reads... The first message reads... A complete collapse... A complete collapse... Of the WTO talks. Of the WTO talks. Did you hear that'? Did you hear that'? It happened, man. Little by little. I told you. There will be no new Millennium Round of trade talks for the World Trade Organization. We'll be back at 6:00 tonight for more breaking news. The second message... The second message... You're gonna like this one, Jay. You're gonna like this one, Jay. All prisoners will be released. All prisoners will be released. - Yes! - Ha-ha-ha! Yeah! Where are you going in such a hurry? I got to go- Are you running away? And I want to see y'all next year, April 16th, IMF. All right. Drinks on me. What the hell are you doing here? Well, it's nice to see you too. One down, a million more to go. Whoo! Ha-ha! Can I ask you something? Yeah. What's your last name? You are a cop, aren't you?
