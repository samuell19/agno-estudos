He wants you to rub his tummy. Shut up! You're number one? You're the best? People love you? Well, sorry because they've found your replacement! You've got some nerve! He thinks he's a perv! What? There isn't enough make-up in the world to hide your ugly face! - What? - He's not ugly! - Oh no! - Don't you dare! Your pretty face can never hide your ugly personality! - What? - He says his face is one big calamity! - What? - Ouch! Stop it! Well, at least I have a pretty face. Unlike you! Awful face, awful personality! That's too much! You've crossed the line! At least I'm not a bitch! She said she sucks like a leech! - No! No! No! - What! What she said was her dark armpits are beginning to itch! Witch! - Oh! She said you're a witch! - A witch! Son of a bitch! No! Motherfucker! You're full of crap! So fierce! You smell of crap! Aah! Boss, we're not deaf. I got deaf from all the screaming. Since you two won't get along, then I will give you a challenge. The 99th assassination attempt against Don Bill has gone viral. I'm sure you know him since he's the wealthiest man in the Philippines. And since the last assassination attempt, he's been a recluse. I want that exclusive interview with Don Bill! Boss, I don't think it's a good fit for the show. Boss, I'll do it! I'm not like this two-faced, good-for-nothing traitor! Here she goes again! I won't back off. I won't give up! If I get that interview with Don Bill, you're done! And if I get that interview, you're not just done with this show, you're gone from my heart forever! Well, you've been dead to me for five years! What?! If I'm dead, then I'll be the zombie that will haunt you for the rest of your life! Oh! Amazing! They really get each other! The X here is Don Bill's house. Oh! I thought Rose was the ex. She isn't my ex! If she isn't your ex, then what is she? A former love. What? You were an item? That's what she thought. Crazy girl. I made it clear who I was. I thought she understood. Maybe you led her on. Were you flirty-hunky with her? No! So! He wasn't a lying cheater! Just a greedy famewhore who left me hanging! Can we not talk about that? We should focus on Don Bill! Follow my lead! Sure! Let's go! So what's our plan? Why do you sound like that?! We're following your lead! How can we enter the mansion with its tight security? Maybe there's an upcoming event where you can get in without getting noticed? Yes! Don Bill will be celebrating his birthday! Will we get invited? Are you friends? Hep, hep, hep! Here we go! We don't need to be guests to get in! They're hiring dancing waiters and waitresses! Waitresses! Why dancing? Who cares? Who knows? The important thing is we dance well and get hired! I'll be a waitress! Me too! Waitress? A waiter, then. How about you? Waitress! Really? But they have special requirements for the waitresses. I'm ready! They need to be beautiful. Just so-so. They need to have large breasts! What a shame. They should have flawless skin. Flawless skin? This Don Bill is kind of a perv, isn't he? You saying my grandchild's a perv-bait? No, Grams. She just met all the requirements! Rose is the perfect waitress. Don't say bad words. She might look like the perfect waitress, but can she do the job? No, but I can learn! What's important is I'm the perfect interviewer! And I will get the interview! If you can pass the screening process. You have lots of fans. Change the name! Fake the resume! People might recognize you. Change the face! Disguise! Where do you hide the camera? I've got the perfect hiding spot! Your days are numbered, Jack. You'll regret trying to take me down, Rose! The exclusive interview is mine! And the show will still be mine! Happy Hour with Rose! And Jack! What if you just share? Over my dead body! Barbara Nicole Rose Albano… goodbye! Don Bill, here I come. - Oh no! It conked out! - What? We'll push it! Get off! - There you go! - Push some more! - Perfect! - There! - Fake ID? - Check. Equipment? Check. Nice! And finally, for the disguise. Who are you? Okay? Oh, yes! Now, let's go! Perfect! Your voice! Take it easy! Are you sure you don't need any backup? Not there! Next! Okay, let's go. More! More! Lower! What's this? Oh… I'm sorry. I'm just excited to meet you. You're cleared. Proceed. That was flirty! I'm Lizel, the Domestic Operations Management Administrator, or DOMA of this mansion. Today is an important day. - Today is the most anticipated, - Shorty isn't here! But the most secret special event of 2022. Where is Don Bill? It's the 75th birthday of the richest man in the Philippines, Don Bill Libme. We have a small guestlist but this party is the biggest, the brightest, the boldest party that will ever change your life. Fabulous! We're gonna get stuffed tonight! Excuse me! Hungry pig, are you? You are waiters... not guests! Na-ah! Dancing waiters! You are hopeless. I don't even know why we had to hire you. We are all better dancers than you. Am I right? - Yes! - Let's dance! Let's show them what we can do! I can do a high kick! Wait a minute. We're missing a pair! We're here! Save the best for last! Ah! Ah! I knew it! They spied on us! - The nerve of these two… - They even copied our moles. Hey! Get in line! Now! Move! To the side! Stop it! Where are the sidekicks? I'm sure you dropped them the way you dropped me. I'm a pro. Unlike you, I don't depend on gays to get the job done! Watch your language! Everyone, this is our security team. This is the head of security, Carlos Salazar. Because of the last assassination attempt on Don Bill, we took extra measures to ensure his safety. That extends to his children as well. If you notice anything suspicious, don't hesitate to report it to us. We might be infiltrated by intruders, spies, moles… Like these? You're getting on my nerves! You wanna do another pat-down? You should check again. No need. I trust my men did their jobs. Too bad. Please, surrender your phones and gadgets. Ma'am, sir, my parents are strict. They have to check on me from time to time. - I need my phone, please! - What are you? A teenager? You look like a senior. Who do you need to report to? No gossips allowed. - No taking of pictures and video. - Wait. Okay. There! Everything that happens in this event is strictly confidential. We can't endanger Don Bill's life. Wait up! Wait! What's happening? Is there a problem? I have to text my father, it's his birthday today. - Give me a minute. - That can wait. Give me a minute. Promise I'll buy you some crispy knuckles! - Just give me a sec! - Surrender your phone! Is it your Dad's birthday today? Yes! Psst! Just go and wish him a happy birthday for me. Leave Don Bill to me. Let's go! Faster. Sir. Ah! Yeah. He's really something. He barely sees his dad and chooses to skip his birthday for this! That's right. I'll be at his party later, after the interview! If you get the interview! I knew it! Idol Jack! Jack who? En Poy! Hale, hale, hoy! Whoever loses is a monkey boy! You're the monkey boy! You look like a monkey! Stop playing! Fools! Shut up! You're getting on my nerves I will tell them what I know! I will tell them! Ouch! - Behave, will you? - She's so annoying! Why are you in disguise? What disguise? Jack Cayanan doesn't have a mole. - He's right. - He sure doesn't! - Hey! - Right? - Say, "Ah." - Ah. Is this okay? You know what, I'm such a huge fan of your show Happy Hour with Jack. You show up every so often, Rose. I'm not her. Still fibbing, are we? DOMA Lizel! - Be quiet! Be quiet! - Ouch! My mouth. Yes, I am Jack Cayanan. But please don't report me. Report her. - Ha! Report him! - I am like your biggest fan. As in, you are the king of the world and you are the king of my heart. So idol… - What?! - Is this like your episode where you pretended to be possessed? Ah-ha. If you like, I could credit you in the special thanks section. Just keep quiet, because your mouth. Okay. Sure. I'll be like a part of the crew, the staff, like your partner. Watch out, sister! He likes wrecking women! Really! Willing to be wrecked! Such a filthy mouth! Welcome to the home of the most successful man… - Come in. - …In the Philippines. Distillery. Gold mining. - Step inside. - Beauty supplements. Real estate. Entertainment. - Gaming, and whole a lot more! - He's filthy rich! He's loaded for sure, but guns are loaded to get him too. Well, when you're number one... Everyone is out to take you down. With that face, you should be taken down. Oh really? You hate this face? I used to put your panties in a twist. Not anymore! You sure? I'm sure! Every corner of this house has CCTV. You do something wrong, and you will be caught. You will be grouped by pairs. Two in the kitchen, four in the fountain area. A pair to roam around, and a pair only for Don Bill. - I'll do it! - I can do it! Are you the DOMA? No, you are. By 7:00 p.m., the VIPs will arrive. Don Bill's children are Amelia, Hugo, and Paolo. We should group as partners. Sure. Just make sure we're always ahead of those two losers. My idol's enemy is my enemy. - You're so cute. - No delays, no mistakes. It seems like you'd rather be paired with him. It seems like you want to lose your job. Oh! Look at Don Bill's pictures! They are beautiful! Check it out! So posh! Dimwits! So uncultured! These are from Hogwarts. But I don't see any family pictures. They're probably not fond of each other? Or they just aren't fond of cameras? Judger! Okay, that's enough! Now, I need to choose… two for roving. You and you! - No Ma'am! - No! Ma'am, this can't be. Who is the DOMA? - You. - I decide! Don Bill buzzed! I need two! Go straight to Don Bill! Fast! Oy! Oy! Go! - Go straight to him. Faster! - Go! Go! Go! Go! I'm not here! Wrong door! Where is he? Excitable know-it-alls! That way! - Move! Go, Idol! - Run, Queen! Run! Ha! Thank you! Argh! Your short limbs are no match for mine! Let me! - Let go! - No! Unlike you, I don't easily let go. Fine! Don't let go then! Ouch! Stupid! - Where is Don Bill? - If this is broken… Not my fault, you dummy! You were the clumsy one! Where is Don Bill? Oh, there he is! Smoking a cigar. Don Bill! - Hello! - Don Bill! Don Bill, you have a lot of weapons. I also have a secret weapon here. Ew. - Ew what? It's fresh! - It stinks. - This is fresh. - Ew, stop it. It smells like fish. Can I put these on the bed? This interview will be exciting! Well, I'm sorry. But I'm gonna get this interview because I'm sexy. I will get the interview because I'm sexier! Don Bill, I am Rose Albano, the one and only, the most beautiful, sexiest... Don Bill, I am Jack Cayanan, I am... - The most-awarded TV host and journalist. - Sexiest, and I have more awards than him! You're a newbie nobody with no awards! - I will make you a happy man! - I am number one! Her chest hair won't make you happy! Don Bill, I have won the most trophies in the Philippines! - Don Bill? - Maybe he's asleep? Don Bill, can you hear us? - Don Bill? - He isn't responding. Don Bill? Either he's drunk or stoned. Don Bill… What is that? Why does he have…? What is that? Don Bill? We have to remove that! Ouch! Why did you do that? Why did you put it back? You fool! - Why did you take it out again? - What am I supposed to do? Just put it back! My God, Rudy! You killed Don Bill! Why did you hit her? - Because she accused us! - We look even more suspicious now! Oh my God! My camera! It's broken! Don Bill is dead. No more interview! What will happen to my show? What the hell? We're about to go to prison and all you care about is your show? Shh! No! Your mouth! No one's going to prison! We'll find a way out of this! Then think of a way out of this! - What should we do? - Well… Why don't we just call the police or his children? Are you dumb? Someone saw us here! She's a witness! Why did you knock her out again? I'm so sorry. Why don't we just tell the truth, that we found Don Bill dead, and we knocked out the maid because we were startled? Would anyone believe that? I hear ringing. Do you have a phone? What is that? I hear ringing. Cellphone! Let's call for help. Hello? Help us! Don Bill is dead! I know. How did you know? I saw you do it. You killed him. We didn't kill him! Liar! If you really saw it, you'd know someone came here before us. Maybe that's the killer. Then what's this? - There's CCTV footage! - He saw you! - Why is it just me? - You stabbed him again! Based on the footage, the two of you killed him. No. No, no! Rewind the footage! Rewind it! - Why is it cut like that? - Because I cut it. Asshole! I'm not stupid enough to show you how I killed him. - Smart move. - Dumbass! Don't you call me a dumb-ass! Then what? - Cute ass. - Ah… I will broadcast this footage around the house. What would the security guards do to you? Especially his children! - No! Don't do that! - We didn't do anything wrong! Who are you?! What do you want?! What do you need from us?! Why are you doing this to us?! I need three coins. Three coins? I have a buck here. Here! Here, this is a twenty! Fresh from the coin bank! Not that kind of coin! - Huh? - Not these. What do you want? Three coins with different colors. Nope. You can't pin the blame on us! We didn't do anything! And we won't be your puppets! Okay, I'll just upload the CCTV footage. Bye! - No! No! No! No! - Let's go! Hello? Will this be quick? - I'm not gonna be blackmailed into this! - Are you nuts?! Let's just do as he says so we could get out of this! - I have to go to dad's party! - Okay, fine! This will be quick if you do as I say. The guests have arrived. What was that? They're here. They must be Don Bill's children. - Let's ask for help! - You're right! Help! Write something! Do you have a pen? I have lipstick! Wait! What else do you have there?! Silicon pads? Or a cabinet? A drawer. Hep, hep, hep, hep! What are you doing? Try to ask for help and you're dead. Hey, we're just saying hello to them. You missed one I, Dumbo. They are all using their phones. What if… One of them is… I have an idea. Let's end the call to know which one of them is talking to us. - Go. Go. Go. - One… two… three… Huh? Redial the number. Let's see who'll take the call. Go! All of them… Why did you hang up? I will upload the footage! Okay, okay, okay! Hello? We're good. We'll play along. What's the plan? Find the three coins. What kind of coins are we looking for? Weren't you listening?! Just find the coins in the mansion! You're asking us to find small coins in this gigantic mansion? They're big. You wouldn't miss them. Then go look for them yourself! Uploading! She's kidding! Watch your mouth. How do the coins look? The shape! Color! How will we know? One is blue, one is green, and the other is pink. Okay? You'll find the blue coin in the room with the blue door. - Obviously. - Uploading. Can't take a joke?! The green coin is in the green room, and the pink coin is obviously behind... We already get it. I saw those doors a while ago. I saw them too. Where is the key? Give it to us. It's with Don Bill. The key is with Don Bill. On him? Let's look for it. What are you doing? Just listen! Wait, he's telling us something. Hello? Listen up. Don Bill is the key. Bring him with you. You need to scan him by the doors to open the rooms. Got it? How will we bring his body? People would see us rolling Don Bill around. Mmm… - Not my problem. - Prick! Is that so? You only have an hour to do this. If I don't get the coins by then, I will release the video. Are we clear? Answer! Okay. - What are you doing? - I'm calling the police. Okay, do it quickly! I have to call my dad. He thought he could outwit us, huh? Sorry, you do not have enough load to make this call. - Damn. - Why? An old phone with zero call credits?! Richest man? Really? So we have no choice but to follow the killer's orders. Seems like it. Hurry! The elevator is too far! Ew! - That's gross! - Let's switch places. Something might happen to Don Bill. Move. They might see us. - Want a drink? - Sure. Let's go. Faster. Faster! Hang on. Oh! He's getting hurt. Oh, he's dead, right. What is that? Scan toe with ingrown? - Huh? - What? A toe with an ingrown? What are you looking for? A toe with ingrown. A toe in his hand?! Toes! - Down there, stupid. Toes! - Ah! My God. It's not just an ingrown. It's swollen. It got murdered. Your toe is as dead as you are. This is a double-murder case! - Okay, stick it there. - Wait. Help me! Raise it! Line it up! Yuck! Wait a sec! - You're so slow! - Wait! - Higher. There. - Wait! What did we get ourselves into?! I'm supposed to be doing an interview, not carting around a dead body! This is all your fault! Hey, hey! Don't you blame me! Why not?! You started this! I did? You're the nosy meddling witch! This is my show! This should have been my interview! Are you that shortsighted? Can't you backtrack a little? This goes all the way back to the past! Are you a playlist stuck on loop?! The wheels on the bus, go round and round? Round and round to the same issues! Try and move on! Like kilometers away from the past! Quit blabbing about the past! We should focus on getting those coins! Focus! We can't be framed for a crime we didn't do! Our careers are at stake! Well… You don't care about your career because you don't have one! You will lose your career because I will take it away from you! Ooh! I'm so scared! Let's wait till the whole world sees that video of you stabbing Don Bill to death! Don Bill is dead? Shh! Shut up! Don't kill me too, Idol! Shut your mouth! - Your big useless mouth! - My mouth! - Is that him? Hello, Don Bill! - He's dead. - You killed Don Bill? - I didn't kill him! He was already dead when we found him. Let's report this to security. We can't. The killer is monitoring us. And he'll release the video of Rose stabbing Don Bill unless we do what he wants. - Oh my! Like in a mystery movie? - Exactly! Definitely! But, Idol, what are you still doing here? Are you helping her? Are you friends again? - No! No, no, no! - No! Of course not! Definitely not! Never again! You know what? You're right. I can just leave. This is not my problem. Go ahead, traitor! Leave me again! It's the one thing you're really good at. Actually, I wasn't planning on leaving you. But since you want to believe the worst about me, I shall indulge. Enjoy… prison. Good decision to leave her. Let her face the killer alone! If she wants, she could even interview him. Have a sit-down, one-on-one! That would be so funny! Oh! What if… Her interview goes viral? And it makes her more popular? But it wouldn't be all worth it if... If I have to share my show with her. Huh? No. It wouldn't be worth it if it kills... My career. I have to go back to Rose. I have to get the coins and force the killer to grant an interview! Why? Since I can't interview Don Bill, I have to make a bigger splash out of this. Once I expose the killer, that dimwit Rose will thank me for saving her from prison. Aren't I smart? So help me. I will give you everything once we succeed. We'll go on holiday. We will slim down these stubby limbs. We'll flatten these flabs. You like that? I can't breathe. That's because your bra is too tight. Let's go. Let's get this over and done with. Let's find the coins so we can give them to the killer. Let's go! Let's go. Let's do this. Wow! Ravishing! Amazing! Don Bill is truly impressive. I want this! All of this! I want a room like this! Before fantasizing about your next DIY project, can we look for the coins first? You went back for the coins, right? Unless you went back for something else. Girl, what drugs are you on? You're high on paranoia. Get off those meds! Can you blame me? Oh no! Here she goes again with her never-ending flashback! Why not just record this sob story and play it on loop? Oh, I will! Until I get what I want! What is it that you want, - apart from my show? - Hello myself! You should know! You're not me. You're a thief, right? - What did you do?! - Why me? Shh! Because you're stealing from me, you have to suffer! Suffer the way I suffered for all that I have! So if you really want those coins, you have to work hard for them. Oh, yes, I agree. You didn't have to work hard for anything. You just played dirty, right? - What are you saying? - Shut up! To get the blue coin… you just have to copy what's on screen. If you get it wrong three times… Game over! The burglar alarm will be activated! And you're dead! Are you ready? Let's go! Game! Go ahead, since you're always a show-off. Oh really? You got it! I got it right? You're practically a horse. - You got it! - Unfair! Yours is easy! How do I do a camel? This is too difficult. Move over. I'll do it. Hey, Rose! What's up with you? - What the hell is your problem?! - Yeah! Huh?! - Why are you so damn angry? - Yeah! What the hell do you want? I want you to say sorry! And realize that leaving me was a mistake. That I'm good! - Correct! - That in fact, I am better than you! Wow, maybe you're forgetting something. You're nothing without me! How dare you! Correct! How dare you! You're just a clown. Amazing! I may be a clown, but I'm the best clown in town! I'm the one who gave you that name! When I thought you were a good person. When I thought we were partners! Who chose to end it all? - You! - Me? You were the one! And for the final wave… copy me! You ruined us! You destroyed our friendship! Because you didn't let me explain! Explain what? Your obvious and unmistakable betrayal? We were supposed to do the show together! Together? What are you talking about? The show was just for me! You were never a part of it! Because you're selfish! That's why you did it by yourself! That's why you didn't want me there! You weren't there because they didn't want you there! The network didn't like you! You know why? Because they didn't think you were any good! Even if I insisted, they never got you! That's the truth! You're almost there. If you still don't get it, you'll end up behind bars! Congratulations! Here's the blue coin! Good luck with getting the green and pink coins. Those are harder. He's calling. - Hello? - Point the coin to the CCTV. Higher. Now, get the other two. You have forty minutes left. Okay. Rose. - What I said before... - Move away. - Guards. - What's wrong? Someone's coming. - Hold on to me. - What are you doing? We have to make them think we're doing the nasty. Just trust me. Don't you dare kiss me. Don't you dare kiss me! - Do you see them? - They're so near… Jack, I don't want to go to prison. I don't want that, either. They're getting closer… Don't move! - Why? - Because that's bad! I said, don't move! You're moving! - Freeze! - Ouch! Don't move! I ordered you not to move, Madam! Madam? What the… My fab friends! I'm glad you're here! I was so scared! Someone hit me in the head! You know who did it? No idea! - Someone did that to me! - Huh?! And someone poked my ass! - Who could have done that?! - Who could have done that?! You! You have a thing for my ass! Put him down. Since you like my ass so much, you can have it! I'm glad you found me. How did you get in? With this disguise, we so fit in! We just had to go after you. We will never leave your side! That's what friends are for! Thank you! We got worried that you might lose your voice. Or that your ex-partner might sabotage your interview with Don Bill. No more interview. The dude's dead. - Dead! - He's dead! He's really dead! - Why didn't you catch me? - He's dead! - Wait! We didn't kill him. - We are not the killers. Help us find the real killer. - When did you become our boss? - Shh! Rose is right. Are you partners again? Nope. Look for Rhed, he can help you. And keep an eye on the family. We both think that one of them is the killer. - Anything for you, Madam. - Yes. We can do this! - We'll go ahead. - But he's dead. You didn't catch me again! - Come on! - Ouch! Ouch! What the?! What are you doing? Are you spying on someone? I don't have anything to say to you. - You do. - I don't. - You do. - I don't. Then, you don't! But I do! You don't! - Yes, I do! - No, you don't. Don Bill is dead! You've got nothing... What?! And the killer is freely roaming around the mansion! - Who is the killer? - Hey! Why are you dimwits here anyway?! Excuse me! We are the loyal assistants and friends of Jack! And I am his new partner. Sis, I think he's still with the former "laugh team." You're so not updated! You're the one who's not updated! - Did you know... - Don Bill is dead? And we're all trying to find the real killer to clear Jack? And Rose! Let's go. - Let's save our friends? - Let's go! Unite? You must be so impressed by their competence. That's why you kept them. Rose… - Carlos! Carlos just saw us! - What? What are you doing here? Huh? Don Bill just needs fresh air. Fresh air? In a narrow, windowless hallway? Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it's not real. Hey! I've been looking for Don Bill all over the place! What are you doing here? Hey! You lost weight, huh? Why is he still not dressed up? Don Bill is drunk. Drunk?! Get him dressed! No! He's about to vomit! Vomit? Just wipe it off! Just let him sleep it off! No! The look on your faces… What's going on? The old man's just plastered from the alcohol. - Nothing's going on. - You've gone catatonic, huh? She's sloshed too. He insisted she drink as well. - Move away! - Hey! Don't do that! Don Bill! Look at me! Oh! Hey! Whoa! So… shocked by the head… lines? Don Bill! I'm sorry, Don Bill! - Goodness! - Calm down. I'll make sure they do what they're supposed to do. There's a performance. Don Bill's children are waiting for him. Make sure he's at the party in thirty minutes. - Appetizers, ma'am. - Appetizers, sir. Appetizers? These don't even look appetizing! Sis, he doesn't think we are worthy of expensive food, because he doesn't see us as income-generating assets. Is this even a party?! And he's absent at his own party?! Well, big bro, at least he's consistent. Always absent. If he still doesn't show up, we'll just leave. He's just getting ready. Hey! What are you doing?! We're just sniffing the appetizer. Smells great! You two, let's go! Let's get Don Bill! We'll stay here and guard the children. They're perfectly safe here. We need additional security. Go to the gate, then. They need additional people. No. We like it here. Transfer to the gate. We stay put. I said go to the gate! - We'll go there! - We're going! Don't leave just yet. Don Bill has an important announcement. Excuse me, I'll just get Don Bill. Come on, Rose! I wanna go home. You've lost your mind! You'll go to jail! That's where we'll end up anyway. Don Bill said the challenges get more difficult for each room. We'll help each other. I'll just weigh you down. I won't get in your way. Besides, I'm no good, unlike you. And your show is all yours. This is what you want, right? Get that exclusive with the killer! Come on! Is that what you really want? Let her go! She still needs you. And you need her. Rose! Rose, wait. I know you still don't trust me, but I promise you, when we enter that room, we are not competing against each other. I am not your rival, not your enemy. I am your friend. Boo! Still so many tricks, Don Bill! Why not join a talent show next year? Too bad you're dead. What a great karaoke room! High-end! Karaoke time! Oh my God, if this is the challenge, consider it done, done, done! Come on, Don Bill! Give me the green disk now! You just need to score a hundred at karaoke. - Easy, right? - There has to be a catch. Of course! Because if you fail, the bomb will explode. Boom! What bomb?! - There's the bomb! - People outside will be in danger! Stop! Don't overthink. We can do this, partner. Let the singing begin! Let's sing. Take that. We will sing. What's the song? Come on, play it. I wonder what the song is. Awww. It's our friendship song. - Go ahead. - We'll sing it as a duet, partner. ♪ If this is the last song I will ever sing ♪ ♪ I want you to know that ♪ ♪ You will always be in my life ♪ ♪ And if I had to say Just one last thing ♪ ♪ It's how you fill my world With color and light ♪ ♪ You've wiped away my tears ♪ ♪ Turned to hope all my fears ♪ ♪ This song I sing is just for you ♪ ♪ Until the end of my days I will love you ♪ ♪ I need you to hear… ♪ Hey!

You're the perfect singer! Very good. Now, you only have to get the last one. - Come on. Harder. - What? Help me! One, two, three. The fallen has fallen! Ouch! - Help me get him up. - He's too heavy! This is stressful! - What's wrong? - Look at him. Let's leave it at that. - Close it like that. - We're too close! Grasp it tight to stretch it. Go, hold it. Stroke it a little. How could you do that to the dead?! Huh? What do you think we're doing? Waiters, performance time. Now! Hello? Missed us already? Don't join the performance. You might get caught. Bigger trouble if Don Bill doesn't show up. People are waiting. You don't have time! Just get the last coin! We'll be quick, promise! We'll just make an appearance and then go to the third coin! Fools! Don Bill's killer is a chipmunk? What a hideous voice! So, what's the plan? Since only Don Bill's children are allowed to use phones, most likely, one of them is the killer. We need to steal those phones to know which one is calling us. They can do that. We'll stay with Don Bill. Yes. We can do it… because we're Jack's Angels. Wait! What about me? Telechubbies, then! Don't let the family go near us. Yes. We'll contain them. - But what if someone comes through? - We'll manage. Okay. Let's go, Telechubbies! Okay, let's go! What if someone insists on a hug? He has COVID. How about a kiss? Monkey-pox! Fine. Oh! There's your dad! Oh, wow. He finally showed up. There they are! Go to him! Why me? Why don't you go? - Madam, let's party. - Oh, yes! I like parties! Not one of them wants to say hello. It's as if they don't like you. You're right. They just don't care, right? Poor Don Bill. Huh? Poor Don Bill? Or his kids? It's likely that he wasn't around so much that's why they aren't used to being with him. Maybe he never made them a priority. They might not even cry when they find out he's dead. Rose, I'm about to cry. Sorry. - Did I hit a nerve? - You did. Be thankful we're friends again. I might have slapped you. Oh! Oh, no. Should we help them? Help them?! What about Don Bill? Who got Don Bill? The killer! But the whole family is there... They didn't kill him! - Let's tell them! - No, no, no! The CCTV footage still implicates us as the killers. Jack, this is dangerous. Let's just leave! What if the culprit wants to kill the rest of the family? Can you bear the thought? We have to help them. We can call the police! What if they get killed before the police arrive? Can we do this? We're partners, right? We can do this. - Okay? - Okay. Where might the killer take Don Bill? - The pink room. - Let's go. Come on! - There he is! - There's Don Bill! You? Yeah, me. The head of security. - What is that? - What? - What are you holding? - Holding? What? Nothing, see? Oh, nothing. Shame… I was about to give these to you. Hey, hey, hey! Give me those coins! Coins? I knew it! You're the only person who would call these coins. These are coins?! These are real coins. Here's a twenty. And a peso. - Give him a quarter. It's down there. - It's right under… - You have one in there! - Wait. There's a quarter there, for sure. - There is one there. - Wait! They fell off! I knew it! You two are the moles! And we knew it! You are the killer! Yes, I killed him. And you were so slow that I had to finish the job myself! Hand them over! Here they are. You want me to shoot you? Here! Here! But we'll go with you. Why?! To make sure you delete the CCTV footage. Fine! Move! What about Don Bill? Push him yourself this time. Hold this for me. You're doing it wrong! Let me! Hold this. Why did you give it back? He's a killer. A killer needs a gun. Ow. - Ah! - Again? - Sorry. - Go on! Move! Quick, you too! Leave him there. Go inside the closet. Do it! Open the cabinet. Huh? Will you change your outfit? - Just open the closet! - But why? - Secret door. - It's a secret door. Move! Hey! Idol! Idol! Idol! Hunky Sir, they are not the killers! We haven't found out who the killer is. We already know. OMG! So you're pushing through with the exclusive? What exclusive? Exclusive party at the exclusive mansion with exclusive guests! Huh? Isn't it an exclusive interview with the killer? Huh? Why would you interview me? - You? - No! Wow! Let's do this! Rose, you can leave. You're not part of this. Where's the camera? - I'm gonna kill you… - I saw it earlier. - And your filthy mouth! - Ask for help! I'll get help, Rose! I'm gonna kill that... What?! What's wrong with you? I'm gonna give it back! Like I did earlier! Don't you trust me?! Men, look for the intruders! Find them! You're both a pain in the ass! Go in! - Quick! Come on Rhed! - Where are Maren and Jorge? The intruders! They're here! Intruders? We're not the intruders! - No, we are not the killers. - Yeah. - Your head of security, Carlos! - He's the killer! You think we'll believe you? No. Move! Straight ahead! Further! Huh? How far is it? Shut up! Both of you! Or I'll blast her head off. No, no! Or I could give you head? Go ahead and kill that selfish prick! Shh! You're getting on my nerves! Rose, please forgive me. You lied about going back to save me. You came back to save your career. That's not true. You two belong together. You're both killers. He kills people. You killed our friendship. Quiet! Put the coins in. Do it! Coins? Really? Put it in. Hurry! Go on! No! I'll do it if you let her go. I'll do whatever you want… just please… don't hurt her. I admit, I came back for the wrong reasons. But then, I realized what's really important to me. You. Even if that were true, it's too late now. We're gonna die anyway. We won't… - What are saying? - If you forgive me… What's this? A silent movie? - If we help each other… - Stop that! What's going on? So, partners again? Yes, I forgive you. - It's been too long! - I wanna pee! - You caught them? - Yes. Good job! Look. - They're tied so loosely. - Huh? - Don't you see it? - You're right. Yeah, dude. Weren't you boy scouts? We weren't. I will teach you how to tie a knot. - Knot? - Go! Teach them! - Not tight. See? - Look! - Sit here! - That's it! Watch. Wait a minute. This is a why-knot! What are you doing? Argh! Yeah! Yeah! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Run! That's how you do it! Can't get out of it now, can you? - Help! We need your help! - The killer is after us! - The killer! - They found the killer! - Oh, the other side! - Quick! Faster! Quick! Imbeciles! - Move fast! - Sir! Sir! Are you calling us? Run! - Rose, hurry! - Hurry! Let's shut it! You're bleeding. - I'm not! - Do it now! Not there! Jack was hit! You're correct! He has hit the jackpot! - Hey! Open the door! - You need to answer the questions! You're correct! I will shoot you all! Hey! They will shoot us! Jack! Rose! Help! The killer is chasing us! What? He's the killer! - What? - Liars! Don't believe them! They are the killers! - What? - What killers? Who was killed? - Don Bill! - He killed Don Bill! You killed our dad? Not me! Them! You killed our dad?! - No! We did not! - No! If you didn't kill him, then why are you disguised as waiters? Oh my God! - Happy Hour with Jack! - And Rose! Digital viral queen! Yes! That's us! - Happy Hour with Jack! - And Rose! Yes, that's us! So you're invited? - No. - See? We were supposed to interview Don Bill! But Carlos had already killed him before we got there. Yes! - Huh? - No! Hey! You don't have proof. I have evidence. I have a witness. Where's your witness? Here! Maritess? I saw them killing Don Bill. You knocked me out twice, right? Thrice, I mean. To make sure I was eliminated! No! We just panicked. We're sorry. Yes! Then he asked us to find large coins. They are not coins! Shh! So he could open Don Bill's vault. Vault? How do you know about the vault? You're working together? No! You're confusing us! I need to talk to Don Bill. How can a dead man talk? Giant Ouija board? Can't you read? Bill Board. Don Bill Libme, are you here? YAS. Who killed you? NAUR. Too impatient to spell? - Hey! - YAS. Would it be easier to just possess someone? My children… …wanna know who killed me? You! You defiled my precious body! Ah! - Ouch! - Endless bickering! - A vengeful ghost! - Oh no! But they did not kill me. He did! - See? It was you! - Yes he did! He killed me! - It's him! - What? You believe her? She's just acting! No! You gunned me down! - I stabbed you! - Oh! Yeah! He stabbed me with a knife. With a syringe! Yes! Because you need money for your ailing dog! My mother! Ah, whatever! You really are a monster! Ah! Guards! Arrest this man! Arrest him! Carlos… How could you do this to us? We trusted you! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. It was an accident! I just needed money for my mother's operation. I didn't intend to kill Don Bill. I'm not a doctor. My mother will die if she doesn't undergo the operation today. We will all die eventually. Your mother before all of us. Evil monster! I won't leave until you give me the money I need! Your mother will really die because I don't have money to give you. Don't try me! What will you do? Kill me? See these? Those are souvenirs from my 99 assassination attempts. None of these killed me. But this… This will kill you! Don Bill buzzed! Go straight to Don Bill! Fast! You're dead! Don Bill… Let me! I accidentally found the vault when the two moles entered Don Bill's room. I failed to guess the password, triggering the fail-safe. I was supposed to get the coins myself, but I thought of using the two instead. Where is the money? Carlos, when he said that he has no money, that was true. Ma… Sorry, Ma. If he has no money, then why did he even throw a party? Because he wants to borrow money from you. - Huh? - From us? Don Bill is poor? He owes me everything that he spent today. Don Bill is poor? Where's the last will and testament? There's none. Just a last bill and testament. Guys, poor Don Bill indeed! - He's already dead! - Don Bill! This is the 100th assassination attempt on Don Bill's life. Is this really an assassination? Or a case of self-defense? We'll find out. We have witnesses! You guys good now? We're all good! Who is this chubby girl? I'm Kookai and I am now part of… the Telebekis! There's the killer! The killer! Wait, excuse me! - Wait up! Wait! - Wait. Are we crying? Yes. Yes, we are crying. Who would've thought it would be our last day as a complete family? They say, a family comes together only during birthdays, weddings, and funerals. Will this be autopsied? Autopsy?! I'm still alive to cremate you! Don't worry. You won't end up like him. Because you still have a chance to make things right. If you want to. I need Jack and Rose! - Where are they?! - Madam! He's still getting stitches. I'll deal with Boss. Go! Really? Go! Thank you! Thank you. That's what a partner is for, right? Thank you! Go! Go! Your dad is waiting for you. Go, Jack! My clown. Sorry, Dad. I missed your birthday. Dad… I love you. It's okay, son. I love you too. Welcome home, bro! - Bro! - Uncle Jack! Group hug with bro! Oh, wait up! Let me join! Waah! - Cake! - That's it! Wait! Let's light it up. You haven't made a wish, Dad? The celebration isn't complete without you. Were you waiting for me to light that up? It's now truly a happy birthday! Yay! Oops, not my birthday. One more! I thought it was me. One more time, Dad. Another one! Go, go, go! Yay! Happy birthday, Dad! Our special episode for tonight is about love and forgiveness. And why not? It's Christmas! And I am Rose Albano… and dinner is served! - Granny Baby, let's go. - Let's eat! Good job! I'm so proud of you! Shh! Pops. He's talking yet again. - You have to recover first, right? - Come on. - I'm not sick. - Let's eat. I just swallowed a hairball. If you don't recover by next year, - I will take over your show for good. - Do it and I will burn all your bras. Eat up. Shut up or I will kiss you. Let's eat! Let's go! Eat! Merry... - Merry Christmas! - Yay! We're gonna eat! Merry Christmas! Come here! Just give me a kiss! Kiss! I'll spit on your face! - Kiss! - Give up! Ah! DADDY BERT GRANNY BABY And… Action! Are you okay? - Me! Me! - Me! Me! Unlike you… blah, blah, blah, blah! The baby! The baby, partner! The baby! Ma'am, make more babies. You seem to be good at it. We have a volleyball game! Just six of you? Barangay… - Uno! - Universe! Sorry! He's going to be the best town… clown! Best town in clown? Town! - I can't! - Wait. That's it? I will be the perfect interviewer. I am… Ready. Don Bill Moko. That's wrong! That's wrong! Why did you pull it out again? You broke it! You killed Don Bill! Why did you hit her? - You're alive! - I'm alive! - Oh my gosh! - Sorry! What? Goodness! She's just waiting. We're all going to die anyway… One more! - Oh? - Oh! Lassy! Because you're slow, I had to finish the job myself. I'm going to kill you both! Sorry! Because you need… money! - To buy… a new dog! - Medicine. Because you needed the money! For medicine! To kill your dog! Yes! Super yes! Wrong line! I'm trying my best! WFH? Work from home? Who's hugging who? Ouch! - Fifty shades? - Sorry! Why? Is he there? There, that's it! Yay! Pack up! Merry Christmas! What's happening?
