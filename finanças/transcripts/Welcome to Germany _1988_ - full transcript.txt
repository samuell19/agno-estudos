Baruch sits here, deep inside of himself, dressed in coveralls, yearning to escape. She stands over his shoulder, working on his hair. Janko comes in the room. He smiles. Mustn't let anyone know this tension that's inside of him. Gets up quietly, unhurriedly, and you pan to the door. Come in. Come up really close. Baruch... ...the space We must accomplish this space. Over my right shoulder. Follow me...quietly We create a tension. Slowly, Baruch walks forward, not paying attention to anybody. Baruch passes in front of the camera and you take him over his left shoulder. Now you see Janko. That's me and the other group on the other side. We go a bit faster now. The distance between us goes a little bit longer. We lose a little connection. That's it. But keep following me. That's it. Quick, quick. Baruch... ...senses danger. He slows down and he stops. Someone's watching him. He slowly circles around quietly. He looks at the concentration camp with... No the studio. Is it the concentration? It's the camp. It's quiet alone. As we come around, we start forward Camera Baruch...slowly to where the tension and the enemy is. Freedom is no more than a hundred yards ahead of him. You're in profile with me. Now we start speeding up. His head goes down. Profile. Yes. Keep going ahead of me, ahead of me. We're coming to the danger now. Slowly Here is Körners group on the left. Pan over to Körners group. Pan over. That Janko standing there, that's me. Silverman is in the group. Keeping up. Pan back to me. And I wish you pan back to me. We go by these people standing here on the set. Just come quickly. Quickly. Around, around. All right. Slow, slow, stop. Silverman sees Baruch here. "Baruch, where are you going?" The SS troopers. So what is he screaming about? Everybody's eyes. Our attention to Baruch. He's no more than a hundred feet from his freedom. Come on now. We must go quickly. He doesn't dare run because he'll be shot standing here. He knows he can get to it. The gate is open. Now, slowly, the gate begins to close the camera begins. Everybody bends together. Close the gate. Close the gate. Go ahead. Go ahead. There I am. He's up on the thing. You settle in. And as the gate closes He starts up and he's shot. Nice to meet you. - Welcome in Berlin. - Thank you. Mr. Cornfield you want to realize a film here in Berlin, in your own direction and in your own production. Can you tell us what it's about and why you're doing it here in this city? It's. It's a story of a handful of Jews who were taken out of the death camp. Brought to Berlin and given small parts in a big German production, in Berlin. And I think the logical thing would be to shoot the film here in the city where it happened. So the film is about a couple of Jews who were brought from the concentration camp to Berlin to play some small parts in a big movie here. And it is shot here, of course, because the story also happened here. What interests you about this story that goes back so far? Well everything happened so long ago. What happened to the Jewish actors, after the film was shot? You see, they promised these jews that when the film would be over, they would be free to leave the country. Not so. They were sent to a death camp. And as far as anybody knows, no one survived that. They were promised that they would be allowed to emigrate after the shooting was finished, but they were all taken back to the concentration camp. And as far as we know, none of them survived the camp. Will you shoot the movie in English or German? Oh in German. Certainly, yes. Can you imagine this movie being made in anything... Any other language than the language of the murderers? Goodbye. Thank you very much. I didn't come here to sleep. I came here to work. I saw you on the television 5 minutes ago. We all wish you success with your movie. Thank you. This is compliments of the management - and this is the key to your suite. - Thank you. - And your wife called from Los Angeles. - Thank you. She'll try it again later. Mr. Cornfield. Your bag. Also a great idea to cast Lebanese as Jews. Probably there are not enough Jews left. I guess this one is not enough. Why does that hurt your Jewish honor? Well, they are also victims. And just like you from Germany, they ran away from Beirut. Times are changing, Germany as a hiding place. If I really get the part, you have to make me a wig with long hair. I can't play a woman from 1942 with my short hair. And you still have to show me how to put one of these on. Because then I would be the make-up artist who falls in love with the Jew and puts a blond wig on him so he can run away. What kind of films did you make in America? We made a couple of very successful series. It was one about a dog and one about a horse. Why are you laughing? We made a lot of money I'm sure the studios look different in Hollywood, but you wanted this one. You are probably the first director to make a film in here again after the war. I'll go get the first actor. Excuse me, but you can' t be serious about that. I don't get a script, instead you copy some joke and then I am supposed to tell it here. Do you find that particularly funny? Do you find that particularly funny? Even that someone like me has to audition here. That is an imposition. But to make jokes for the role of a concentration camp prisoner, I think that's in bad taste. Mr. Cornfield wanted it this way. Either you start now or you leave. If this film were not such a serious subject, I would not undergo this procedure. You can translate that for him. Please don't translate the next one. Apparently, American directors believe that they can use the Jewish problem to practice Nazi methods. Mr. Cornfield understands German. So now you start. Moische wants to go on a trip. He overslept, so he arrives at the station at the last minute. Is there war between Egypt and Israel? Two Viennese Jews sitting in a coffee house Blau asks Grün. Tell me, Blau, what would you do if Hitler were sitting here in the coffee house? Two Jews are sitting in a café in Berlin during the Nazi era. One says to the other... I just saw your car brought down. The smallest one and everything in. Well this is Rosa. She's the makeup girl from Zurich. Let's go. I don't want to tell a joke, but a poem by Heinrich Heine, a Jew from Düsseldorf. A young man loved a girl Who had chosen another man; This other man loved yet another girl And wed that one. I don't know the second verse. Moische, the world-famous Hollywood director wants to get married. His brother, the doctor said: "Moische at your age. You are 75. How old is your bride?" Yeah she's 21. And the brother says, "So it's not dangerous? You know a heart attack on the wedding night and so on.... "Well," says Moische, "If she dies. She dies." What made you think of me, of all people? I know that you were a rabbi and that you know most of the prisoners because of that. Did you say I was a rabbi? Probably you think you can be a rabbi, the way you are a film director. Someday, somehow change professions. How do you actually know that I was and am a rabbi? From the Commanding Officer. Then she also gave you permission to bring 13 extras for your film to Berlin. And to leave it up to me to decide which those are. The permission comes from the Ministry of Propaganda. And I made the decision who picks them. What is your film about, if you don't mind me asking? In a village with German farmers and Jewish merchants, a rich old Jewish moneylender falls in love with a German peasant girl, who is in turn promised to a poor farmhand. The girl's father, who is in debt to the moneylender, refuses to give his daughter to him as a wife in order to buy his freedom. The daughter, however, saves her father's country by marrying the unloved man, and hanging herself after the wedding night. And in return, the farmer kills the moneylender. A parable about the unhappy love between our two cultures. It could perhaps be understood in two different ways. How do you mean? Yes, the audience leaves the cinema and realise that money makes war between people, or or they will feel that we are rightly imprisoned here. Yeah maybe one has something to do with the other. And you can guarantee that the 13 I choose will be allowed to emigrate to Switzerland after the filming? I guarantee it. Please let the first 5 be called here. Number 481 to 485 Go to the truck and tell the world. Number 496 to 500 Take me. Me please. I'm an actor. Why do you only take amateurs? Aren't we allowed to live? I was an actor in Munich. You can check. Salomon. my name. I was... You can check. Even the commanding officer admired me. That's why I don't have to cut my hair off. Yes. Munich back then. Now in the mines. Shylock. My Shylock. I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you And if you And if you And if you - And if you - wrong us, And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? Go to the world and come back a winner. Go to hell and tell the devil. Go to the movies and kiss my ass. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction. The Revenge. Number 601 to 605 Stand up straight. You're from Berlin. I've seen you before. Bank director Silbermann? Of Silbermann and Levy? Yes, that's right. Yes, now I remember too. Do you remember Levy? The reception at Döblin's by the Wannsee. You were in the company with a lovely lady. I'd like to have these two gentlemen. Yes, I understand. Like Mr Levy, you imagine a Jew. For your purposes, at any rate, and for those of others. You know we're not supposed to let ourselves be photographed. You know the saying. Thou shalt not make a picture of thyself. Then go to Switzerland, and reopen what they have closed to you. Would I be allowed to fetch my fur coat from the security room? It's a gift from my late wife. Fetch it before you leave Number 606 to 610 Go to the truck and tell the world. One moment. He stays. He's not only a Jew, but also a criminal. He was transferred to us from the penitentiary. And he can't even speak German. How will he talk at all? Stand back in line Take him. I'm not going. Why don't you want to go? I not go without friend. Friend? He wasn't exactly acting like a friend. That's my business and friend. I told you... I have an order from the Propaganda Ministry. My superior authority is the Reich Security Main Office, not your ministry. Please send for the man you just sent away. Mr. Levy I'm sorry. Go to your studio and shoot what you think is the truth. They didn't have it so bad here back then. Living in the studio where you shoot. At least they didn't have to drive back and forth across town all day. Thanks very much. I wouldn't be able to do an actor's make-up with machine guns pointed at me. My hands would shake. Zoom in, zoom in. To the sea. Can't you see? All right. Zoom in, zoom in. His assistant from America doesn't know any more either. Why Cornfield is making a film out of this material. Good question. Since you play well-fed traders in this film, I have managed to get permission from my ministry for special rations. I hope this is also in your favour after the camp rations. I regret very much that our canteen seems not to have been informed that your faith prohibits you from eating pork. I will see to it that such blunders do not occur in future. However, I must tell you that when we were granted the special permit, we were also given the responsibility of continuing to treat you as prisoners until the end of the shoot, i.e. until you leave for Switzerland. Any attempt by one of you to escape would inevitably result in the return of all of you. But now I would like to toast with you to the success of this film. The champagne, please. I apologise again for the uncomfortable height of the table, but we couldn't find anything more suitable in our hurry except these things. So you now have the opportunity to ask questions, and I will introduce to you the staff of the film who are present here. Do I put make-up on the ladies and gentlemen? One moment, please. Sorry Yes Hair and women. - I beg your pardon? - Women. A Jewish merchant must have a wife. Or did the Jews live like Cathols in a monastery? That means Catholics. Catholics, Cathols, Jews, They all eat pork when they're hungry. Except for idiots like you. So what about women? I see what you mean, but the ministry maintains prison conditions. - Men and women not mixed. Yes, Mr Silbermann? - Please May I know where we're staying? In this storage. It's been cleared out especially for this purpose. So if there are no further questions, I'll introduce you to my staff. This is the actor who plays the farmer. You will know him from many films. Mr Dietrich Our cameraman: Mr. Stöcklein. This young actress, Miss Glück. She plays the farmer's daughter. It is the first time Miss Glück will appear in a big movie. She's only played in theatre so far. She's my discovery. And this is our make-up artist. Miss Sofie Graben, who will do your make-up every morning. And our costume designer, Mr Zacharias. I can't imagine they were so noble back then and didn't eat pork. I bet they didn't get anything to eat in the camp. But if that's how he imagines it, or if it sells better that way... I have another question. Do I believe what I'm saying? I mean, does Körner believe himself when he promises the Jews emigration? Only Körner knows that. And Körner is dead. D E A D right? So we'll leave it like that. I want that show you rehearsed earlier ok? Very good We'll now jump directly into the celebration. Everyone as rehearsed. Please take your positions. We're about to shoot Ready? Everybody ready? Please, quiet. Roll it. Action He's like my little brother, he's always following me around. Like a wet dog. And everything he can do, he learned from me... Except the big mouth. That'll come. When they brought you into the camp, you didn't say a word. Now you' re doing quite well. And you're giving me some acting lessons so that I can prepare for my film career in Switzerland. Then I can finally pursue an honest job. If you think acting is an honest job... And I'll tell you this. You'll make a handsome fellow out of me. You'll get a wig with those curls. Give it to the others. I want my hair like this, and like this. Not so Yiddish. "Dankeschön" and "Bitteschön". We don't do that. Janko You're not born a Jew, you're made to be one. Our people hardly have butter on their bread, and this scum fill their bellies. Iron makes a nation strong and butter makes it fat. That's what Göring said. You'll be very surprised. Youstill believe You'll end up in Switzerland. Let them be. Slimy bastards. They make the films that are used to put them down. Whores. They're only pissed off because they have to serve Jews. Sorry Or because you' re allowed to play in this. Here for you. No, thank you. You drink it on your own. Come on... Do what you want. Here's to you. What's wrong with him? You have to understand. We're on war rations, and when we see this... Yes, I understand. You know, we come from the camp and you don't hear anything there. And your friend told me that because of the emigration and the promise... How am I supposed to make up a clown? A clown, and the circus is on fire. Why don't you join the military? A clown with a gun. If you don't go, I'll go. What's the matter with her? She was in love with a circus clown once. He had to join the army and got scared. He hid in the circus and burned to death. That's why she left Switzerland. Now I can already learn the lines on the bus. Because Mr Cornfield graciously lets you have the scenes three hours before shooting starts. Do you at least know what it's about? Then we can give it a try. So I do Baruch's make-up, and Janko watches. But I don't know who loves whom in this film either. Baruch - Janko, Janko - Baruch, both me or me one of them. Let's both try it out. How long were you in the camp? Two years. Why do you want to know? I think I'd hang myself if it was like you say. They look at each other in the make-up mirror. And you're from Berlin? Where from? Charlottenburg And you? Prenzlauer Berg. Not such a high-class neighbourhood. I wouldn't... I wouldn't care if I got out of here somehow, because they hardly believe themselves that we can leave to Switzerland. A German film crew and an American director. While the staff, actors and assistants are waiting for Mr. Cornfield and the shooting to start, we ask them about their impressions of their director and their roles in this international production. What I have to say about Mr Cornfield: At first I thought, here comes someone from America, terrorising us with his money, with his language, with images I didn't exactly understand, and with a story I didn't exactly understand. I became uncertain for the first time tonight. Not thinking about why. I have questions all the time, of course. My main question is: what moves an artist, a director, like Körner, to work in a fascist state. When I think about Cornfield well you know, one time he was like a father to me, taught me everything I knew. This is very strange. I mean he really helped me along. And we made some really, you know, really successful things together. And then he retired when he was on top, too. I mean, he had a lot of successful series. And then I don't know, I mean, we come here, I don't know what we're doing in Berlin. We'll talk to the hotel owners and people to don't give it away ...I don't think that's a problem. These are 30 dance couples I ordered from a waltz club. Oh, by the way, there was a guy in the production this afternoon... who auditioned and whom you turned down. He says he was one of the Jews in Körner's film. He showed us his concentration camp number, on his forearm. Here's his address. This is not Körners villa. No, but I thought it was the villa Körner might have lived in. A good background for the party. The interiors are spooky. I want Körner's villa. This Körner really existed? I always thought it was a figure invented by you. Was there actually this make-up artist who helped a Jew escape? I mean, did I really exist? I want Körner's villa. Please, do you know, where this is? Mommsenstrasse. It's near Rosa's hotel, right? I'm terribly embarrassed. If I'd known the director himself... No, move over to the right and then tap lightly. Please take a seat. Fred. Wake up! You have a visitor. The director from America is here. No, move over to the right and then... Wake up, Fred, the gentleman... What was your name? Cornfield Mr. Cornfield is here, the one you did the screen test with. Oh, sorry. I don't feel so good. I'll put something on straight away. One question. You were in the film back then. Did the Jews go to the same camp afterwards? My husband doesn't want to be reminded of that terrible time. Pleas understand that. Leave it. If you do make the film, of course you want to know exactly what happened. We were divided into different camps after filming. The doctor forbade my husband any excitement. He has a serious heart condition. He was already so upset that you turned him down after the screen test. Now, if you'll just... I have a part for you. How many were you back then? That's very nice. It doesn't have to be a big part. As you can see, we're not doing very well. We were thirteen. Do you recognise me? Where's the number? Where's the number? Please understand. I've got... It's so terrible. Please forgive me. I had no way of knowing that you... I only wanted to because you didn't give me a part in the film. I've always admired Jews. Please forgive me. They dismissed me as a minor actor in the Schiller Theatre. And I wanted... I should have known. I... How do you know everything? I read everything that happened back then. Also in that book. I was in a different film at the time. I auditioned for Körner. He didn't take me. How did you do the number? I got it from our grandson, the stamp. He always comes to play on Sundays. I always wanted to play a Jew. What fault is it of ours that you're a Jew and had to go to a concentration camp? What fault is it of ours that you had to make that film back then? You think we didn't suffer? You could have escaped once you were out of the concentration camp. Why don't you make your film in America and leave us alone? And then you come here. Here, of all places, where you think every second man is a murderer. That may all be true, but what the Germans promise to do, they do And if they promise that we'll go straight from here to Switzerland, well... Just ask the Russians, they promised them a non-aggression pact, and now they're on the brink of Moscow. And even Stalin believed them. What do you know about a word of honour? Mr. Körner promised us. And Mr. Körner isn't a Nazi. I knew him before this Herr Hitler came to power. He has always shown himself to be a gentleman of honour. Everything is splendid here. That's why Herr Körner also allowed Herr Silbermann to bring his fur coat, in which Herr Silbermann will then be buried. But not in Switzerland. Hahaha, Mr. Baruch Yes, yes laugh, laugh. They were able to take my wife, my bank and my freedom, but not my dignity. Not even you. Hahaha Herr Silbermann. Some drunken German SS man talks nonsense, and a dozen Jews believe it. Disgraceful rabble. It would serve you right if they sent you back there. How about a brown uniform, Mr. Silbermann? And I'll show your old lady the Jew photo, too. So she can see what kind of company you keep. But she hasn't let you touch her for three years. Yes, Nazis are strong eaters, but Jews are better in bed. Quiet back there! Cut Thank you. I want to shoot Baruch and Janko next. Two shot by the beds. We're filming the conversation between Baruch and Janko. What happened yesterday with Cornfield? He was with the extra with the number. Is it fun playing Nazis? Always, if the money is right. Germany, Germany above all... Don't forget that toast over there. Now I understand this. He's making a movie about himself. Can I say something? Wouldn't you like it if, after this tough talk, talk, I didn't have to lie here among the others? I mean, in the next shot I could simply take my sheets and move to a different corner than I'm in now. Yes Oh well. Sure, I'm an actor and I have to make a living, but what I've always wanted to ask you is... Mr. Cornfield, where did you get the idea to use a French actor to play a Berlin banker? Jews are people without a country. Quiet. Körner says it is still... Oh, them, they don't realise anything. And even if they did, they're too cowardly for treason. Where do you want to go, where Hitler is not? Two more years, the whole world is Germany Maybe SS man lie and Switzerland thing good. Maybe, maybe. And for that word I should go to the gas? Maybe I stay here. With my language, police next corner. Again from the beginning, please. Even quieter Körner says it is still... Oh, them, they don't realise anything. And even if they did, they're too cowardly for treason. Where do you want to go, where Hitler is not? Two more years, the whole world is Germany Maybe SS man lie and Switzerland thing good. Maybe, maybe. And for that word I should go to the gas? Maybe I stay here. With my language, police next corner. If one run away, all go to camp, Körner said. I helped you on truck. And now you want me to die? You be reason when I go to camp again. You're from Berlin. You know every street. Donelly? Just what's going on here? Why did I have to wait at the airport for 2 hours? Why didn't anyone come to pick me up? Why do I have to call the hotel, to find out where my husband is shooting? All right. That's all right. We continue tomorrow. Goodnight. Goodnight. Sorry boss, I forgot. Where did you pick up your German? I thought you were born in Hungary. I thought you were making this movie in English. Why should he shoot the movie in English, if he was in a KZ in Germany? What does the word KZ mean? Well, things are just about sorted out. He's got a few formalities to settle and then you can go German thoroughness, you know what I mean? And after all, it wasn't a real big disaster or anything. And that's what we're here for, you might say. And we're still the occupying power in this place. By the way, I've seen every serial you've made. Spent the whole of my childhood in front of the TV, seems like. My dad always used to say, Look at that, son. The biggest problem for white folks is their pets. Some horse or dog Shipped off the old African Block, my dad. He still writes me here in Europe and tells me to look around and watch the white folks fighting among themselves. Just like they did when he was a soldier here during the war. You know, I've never been able to quite figure out what he means by that. But then that's another story, isn't it? That's your America too, "Herr Kornfeld". California here I come right back where I started from. Just because, you came from somewhere else, from Hungary or just because you want to live like some kind of traveling salesman. Because you're from Budapest You never even told me where you're from anyway. Because because you were a number, because you lie. I want to go home, You either work together, or you live together. What the fuck you're looking at, dog? Eh? Never saw a man before? What are you looking at, Donnelly? Hey, wise guy. You think I didn't notice what you said to my wife in the car? It's none of your business. Do you understand that? None of your business. Get out of my face. Get out of my life. What's the big deal about a man making a movie of his life. Life, reality. Mumbling I'm sorry. I love dogs. Some of my best friends are dogs. You can barely whisper. Nazis. This place is loaded with Nazis Everywhere I look, Nazis The night. You think so? Got tonight off? Eyes out, two others in. Other hair on. Paint a mouth. Glue on a skin. It's my job. Making faces. My job. Here again. Well, what a nice conclusion he's written? The way I see it, today will be the last day of shooting. Probably the escape of the two poor Jews to America. He won't want to shoot a steep rise as a producer, too. Just a moment. This can't be true. Why didn't anyone report him? Read this. You always wanted to play a young widow. That's great. I always wanted to be the first aide to a murderer What did he say? Our director killed his friend. So it seems. I, the moneylender Silbermann, lent you 1,000 ducats a year ago, so you could till your field, farmer. Today, when the deadline is due, you can't pay me back. So I will go to court and have your field seized. From tomorrow, it will be mine. Grant me a respite, Silbermann. The harvest was bad. The rain was heavy. My wife died on me and I had no help. Have mercy! Money or the field is mine. I can offer you a way out. You have a beautiful daughter. Give her to me in marriage. I won't sue my own father-in-law. Never! Never! Never! She's my only one, and I won't give her away. Rather shall I suffer death. I'll marry you. You old man. Only to my father. Expect no love, for I cannot give you that. But my body, it is yours. Oh, poor me, a Jew. And yet, I will accept your proposal. For my heart is inflamed with love. Woe is me! She has sacrificed herself. She has given herself to him. I poor father! Thus goes my flesh. First my wife toils to death for the Jew's credit, then my daughter throws herself under him and hangs herself. All so that a German can make his own earth fertile. Blood money, all that. You, Jew, will pay for it. And days will come when your people will atone for ours for their suffering. It is money that makes us suffer. And he who possesses it. So this is the film we are making. In a short version, of course. The Propaganda Ministry wouldn't buy it like that. I would like to thank the Ministry staff present here once again that the Minister who unfortunately cannot be here today, made it possible for me to cast the jewish roles in this film, with real jews. I have invited two of the extras to our small celebration this evening. So that they, together with our leading actress, can show us the little puppet show. We thank you for that. Music, please. The party is on And then I took out the gun and said: Raid! And they all had their hands up. Five minutes later, I had 30,000 reichsmarks in my bag. If that asshole of a cashier hadn't rung the bell, I would have been gone. From Budapest, Hungary. But in three weeks I'm going to Switzerland. I have postcards from Switzerland. From mum from album. I'm going to the post office again. Why don't you become an actor? You're very good, from what I see. With my language. Everyone laughs in Switzerland. I don't understand why Körner invites these idiots to his house. Does he live here alone? I think so. I don't know what's up with him anyway. Now they're dancing with our women. I wonder when they'll drag them to their mattresses. Not hungry, great master? Or are you thinking about the next scene? I'm not thinking about anything. This is a feast for the dead. Guess why I invited you to perform this puppet show? Because it was the only time I could see my film. Even if it was only as a Punch and Judy show. I'm not your director anymore. This is the last time I'll wear this suit. Starting tomorrow, I'll be wearing a grey one. And a steel helmet on my head. Maybe I was listening too closely when the rabbi said how to make this film. Anyway, that's what the Minister of Propaganda meant when he dismissed me. And I don't have a friend as good as you. Who'll put in a word for me. There's one good thing about it. I have no one to bring the grey letter to when I've fallen. And what about the promise? Switzerland, I mean. Good question. In fact, why don't you just stand there and shout: "He wants my flat key" Körner told the two Jews they weren't coming to Switzerland. Then the musicians will stop playing, they'll draw their guns, take us back to the studio, then to the camp, then turn on the gas tap, and you'll be sitting in your mask room again, looking at yourself in the mirror. I told him to stay up here, not go down to the basement. I don't understand why he went down to the basement. Why he's hiding down there. I don't get it. I just don't get it. I told him the air raid sirens were our last chance... And I told him you'd give us the key to your flat. Are you crazy? If he's such a coward, he'll tell them they'll find you in my flat. Then it's both of our asses. He's too cowardly even to betray. He'd rather go to the gas chamber. You stay here. I don't want to go to the camp. I told you what's going on. The film's off. Körner's going to the front. You stay here. You stay here. Let's see this. Have you gone mad? Now you're starting to tear each other apart. I no go in gas. I go to Switzerland. Why didn't you stay down in the basement? With your actress? Why did you come up here at all? If you go away, I go back to camp. And so will everyone else. Either you get out of my way now, or you come with me... Or I throw you dead on stairs. Come on! You wouldn't dare anyway. Come on! Then you would have fought back at least once in your life. Not like this. Not like this. Not like this. Not like this. Not like this. Not like this. Cut I didn't like it. I don't like any of it. Let's wrap up, ok? We do it tomorrow. This isn't film, this is therapy. He calls himself a professional director. More like a professional patient. The time that we wasted on this damn film. I can't imagine what he's been going through. What are you talking about? You two are a pair. Now I understand why you always speak in German with him, pretending like you've known him for the last 20 years. And you should go to Hollywood and take my job. You probably think you can be a rabbi like you are a film director. You know we're not allowed to have our picture taken. You know the phrase, don't you? Thou shalt not make a picture of thyself. A parable about the unhappy love between our two cultures. Yes the viewers will leave the cinema knowing that money makes war between people, or Or they will think that we are rightly imprisoned here. Maybe one has something to do with the other. You can guarantee that the 13 I pick will be allowed to emigrate to Switzerland after the shoot? He's like my little brother. He's always following me around. Like a wet dog. When they put you in the camp, you didn't say a word. You're doing fine now. You won't get far like that. Poor little Baruch. And neither will you. Poor old Janko. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Baruch, is deep in his thoughts. Deep inside of himself. He is dressed in coveralls, sitting here, waiting. Yearning to escape. She stands behind him, working on a wig. Janko comes in. He mustn't let Janko see anything on his face. He smiles. He stands up. And we pan with him to the door. Comes into a close-up. Come closer. Come on. A little bit closer. I want to see Baruch and the danger. Over the shoulder. We move quietly. At the beginning just tiptoeing. Look we don't want to attract any attention. We can pick up a little speed now. Just a shade faster. Ok. Baruch will cross camera to the other side. This way we can establish the danger. You now can see the group there. You can see Janko. That's me standing in the foreground. We now pick up a little bit of speed. A little faster. Now he gets frightened. We slow down. Stop, stop, stop. Now Baruch is gonna circle around. So that you see a concentration... No I mean the studio. a concentration... I've got to escape. I can't live like this. I've got to get out of here. Pan with me. Alright, take me down slowly now. Slowly, slowly. Delicately, quietly. Now let's pick up a little speed. We must start creating an excitement here. A little spped, anxiety. As Baruch goes for the gate. Quickly, quickly. Head down. Not letting anybody notice him. Now, in one minute I want you to pan over to the Körner group. There is Silbermann. Pan over now. There. There is Janko. That's me standing in the foreground. Okay, now whip back to me. Slowly. And whip pan. Past everybody here at the studio. Up forward now. Ok, don't stop. Shhh, quiet. Silbermann spots him. Okay. Baruch, what are you doing? Where are you going? He is spotted. Baruch now, without trying to cause any attention to himself goes a little bit faster. Faster. A little quicker. Quicker. He's coming to the gate. He is so close to his escape. But he can't create any more excitement. But he's been spotted. Close the gate. Now the three of us. Three of us. Yes that's it. You go ahead. Alright. Go through. Through. That's it. Bring the gate. Close it. Close it. Close it. The gate closes. He starts up. He is shot. But it wasn't like that Elisabeth, it really wasn't. Only because he took Baruch and his early death on his shoulders. He is probably the only Jew who secretly wishes all the other Jews had died. So that no one could tell on him. And the story he played here was in reality quite different. But he can't know that because he didn't see anything. Because I, Elisabeth, am the only one who can still tell it. And you really believed all this? How much does he actually pay you to film Baruch's murder here? Or do you all work for free? Out of conviction, as it were. as anti-fascism? Because you want to help crucify the Nazi plague? Because it's spreading again? Elisabeth, have you noticed? They opened the gate for me. Janko Kornfeld The only Jew with blue eyes I've ever seen. What do you think he's thinking now? That the Nazis broke little Sofie's back. Just because she got Baruch a wig and a coverall. Baruch wasn't lying on the gate when he was dead, he was down there. But he can't know that, Elisabeth, because he wasn't there. Maybe Mr Kornfeld should lie down there and try it out. Oh, he doesn't want to? He doesn't want to. Then my friend will show you. She nursed me for 40 years and knows the story very well. Elisabeth will show you. Elisabeth next to the manhole. The hand. Janko is still sitting in front of the same mirror and doesn't know what he sees. Sofie or just the actress, without make-up, from his film. Because his eyes are two liars. That's the thing with the truth And you are all in this film. SS Silbermann? That's nice. Very similar. Even the fur You were gassed. Like all the extras who were here. You were simply expendable. Janko? He would have liked to stand here. Mr Kornfeld. But he wasn't there. Where was he? Ah, yes, in the make-up room. Give me a hand, young man. It really looks like the old days. I already worked here as an apprentice. Now I'll show you where I last saw him. That's exactly the way I used to walk every morning. To make up the Jews back there. A love story you must know. Between a Jewish moneylender and a German farmer's daughter. That's where Baruch sat. You were already made up. Both very close to each other. I stood behind him and just taped his wig. I know. No one in the world could have recognised him. Janko watched us in the mirror Now I'm scared! He said. Come with me said Baruch. Got up and went outside. Janko stayed seated. I followed Baruch. I wanted to see how my work would save his life. But Janko stayed in his seat. Well, he was right. Baruch walked towards the open gate. Suddenly he saw that Janko was not behind him. He turned around. Again and again. Then he got scared, so he started to run. And everyone was looking at him. He ran faster. Past the two SS men. Where is he going?, they said. Probably to dye his hair. The SS man drew his revolver. No, you. Herr Silbermann, took two steps forward, raised his hand, and that's when the shot went off. I don't want to play anymore. Excuse me, Elisabeth. Here Baruch, it's the end of your film now. One way or another. Janko Kornfeld from Budapest Wouldn't it be better to do the rough cut here in Berlin, in case we have to reshoot any shots? And I think it might be better if I stay in Berlin and make the rough cut and bring it to you in L.A Destroy it. Everyone's asleep. And work in dreams. For pictures, for money. For whom? Are you dreaming me or am I dreaming you? Yesterday or tomorrow. Young and old. Sleepwalkers everywhere Where are we going? Who are we hurting? Why? And what pictures do we take of it? We ask the pick-up man for the child Marek Vogel to go to gate 13. They mean me. Mum and dad put me on the plane in New York. And now there's no one here. But look what they gave me? So much money. Look what they gave me. Why don't you say anything? Don't you think it' s funny? All passengers of flight 697 to passport control at gate 13. You wanted to fly away, Grandpa. Why are you staying here? Last call for Passenger Cornfield, booked to Los Angeles via New York. Please proceed to gate number 13. Is that your name?
