BOMNAE FILMS Presented by Jeonju International Film Festival Are you here on holiday? Jeonju Cinema Project 2018 No, on business. It's been a long time since my last visit. When was your last visit? About 30 years ago. I served in the military here in Chuncheon. 30 years? That's around the 1988 Olympics, right? Yeah, you're quite right. Wow. That was a long time ago. Are you traveling with your girlfriend? She's my wife. Aha. That's nice. Oh, great. It must be nice to travel together. Chuncheon is a nice place. By the way, there used to be a lot of street stalls selling sea shells and stuff. Oh, they cleared them all up for sanitation reasons. Pardon me, but how old are you? We must be about the same age. I was born in 1968. The year of the monkey! We're the same age. Is that so? - Yes. It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Did you go to a college in Seoul? - Yes. - I see. I lived in Seoul until the IMF. That's when things fell apart. Now I'm driving a cab. Oh, I see. What the... Aren't there a lot of student tourists here? - Here? Oh, the Chungyepng Temple? - Yes. Nah, just a bunch of adulterers. What's his problem! That's all in the past. You know when we used to bring girls here, hit some booze... You know what I'm talking about. Hey honey, did you see my cell phone? - Huh? - My cell phone. - It's not in your back pack? - No. Would you call my phone? Why is he doing that? Jesus... Hey! What are you staring at! Bugger off! - No answer? - No. Keep calling. I'm sorry but is it possible to make a U-turn? Could you take us back to where we started? - I can't turn back now. - Please. - Oh, jeez. - I'm sorry. - It's illegal to do a U-turn here. - I'm sorry. Jeez. How hard is it to hold on to a cell phone? - Keep calling. - I'm on it. - Should I turn the car? - Yes, please. Winter's Night A lady says she has lost her phone. Is there anything at the lost and found center? No. - From Yanggu or the Chungpyeong Temple? - Chungpyeong Temple. Chungpyeong Temple! Mr. Kim is in charge but he is away now. Stop joking. Nothing? Okay. - I don't think it's here. - Okay. Very well. Let's go. But it's been less than an hour since we got off the ferry. - If it hasn't set off yet. - It has departed. The staff brings any lost articles before departure. We haven't received anything yet. Okay. If you want to go back, the last ferry departs at 4:30. What time is it now? It's a little past 4. - Two tickets, please. - Yes. There. I'll fast forward. - Please rewind. - Okay. You're leaving. Looks like you had everything. - I'm sorry. - No problem. - So would that be all? - Yes, thank you. Sorry to bother you. I guess we're late. Let's go back. - Huh? - What do we do? We can spend the night somewhere and come back tomorrow. - If we can go inside... - The light's on. - Excuse me? - Hello? Is someone there? - Yes? - Sorry. I came to the temple this morning and seems like I left something. - Yes. - May I go up and look around? - No, you can't. - Please, it's important. - No, I can't help you. - I understand. We'll come back another time. - Please. It's a phone. Phone... - I can't help you. Wait a minute. He said no. You heard him. Let's go, huh? Hey, honey. Come back! What are you doing? Hey, why won't you listen! Where is she? Where did she go? - Excuse me. - Yes. - I'm looking for someone. - Yes. Have you seen a woman wearing a red coat? No, why? Are you supposed to meet her here? We kind of missed each other. Oh dear, at this hour of the day? This is a dead end. Is there any other place that's open? They're all closed. Wait, let me get rid of this. Then, are there any guesthouses that's open? Guesthouses? We also do B&B. Most restaurants here do. I know that, but I'm asking if any of them are open at this hour. Oh dear. That's as hard as finding a needle in a haystack. Why don't you come inside? Come in. You look all pale. - Would you like some soup - Beg your pardon? Fish soup. It'll warm you up. Thank you. There is no police station nor patrol guards near here. Instead we keep an emergency contacts list. It's only a short list. I can make some phone calls if you want. Yes, please. You can come in. Why don't you come in? It's warm here. Come and wait inside. Hey! Ms.! You don't have to bother. I found her. - You found her? - Yes. Good gracious! Don't lose her again you clumsy man. - Sorry to bother you. - What a relief! What a relief! Come on in, come. Why are you standing in the cold? Come on in quickly. Thanks for putting up with me. Why do you say that? You know, it takes a lot of patience. I guess to live is to suffer. Anyway, this place seems familiar. - You noticed that now? - Noticed what? This place... This place what? What's going on? What's up with this place? You don't remember? Remember what? What is it? We've been here. Before? - Yes. - This place? Yes! They've renovated the place a little. But the interior is totally the same. - Really? - Yes. You saw when you went to the bathroom? - Yes. - I haven't been inside. It's the same place. - What a coincidence. - Isn't it? You know what? When I realized that this was the place, my heart started racing. Is that why you're acting weird today? Yes. I'm full. I want to go inside. We'll go. You want to get ready for bed? I need to use the bathroom, brush my teeth... - Do you want to eat more? - No, I'm finished. You don't have to stop eating because of me. No, I had my fill. It was incredible. I was mind blown. Where is the lady? Excuse me. - Where did she go? - She was here before. Yes. You're leaving? - Yes. - 36 bucks. I'll knock off a buck. - Thank you. - Cash, please. - I got it. - No, I got it. Thank you. - Did you enjoy the food? - It was delicious. - So did you find a place to stay? - Pardon? - Do you have a place to stay? - We should go back. It's too late to go anywhere. Did you bring a car? - No. - The last ship sailed hours ago. - Already? - It doesn't run after dark. What shall we do? Is there anywhere we can stay the night? You don't have to look far. It's right here. We do bed and breakfast. We have a warm room. Are you a couple? - No. - No, we're friends. Jeon-dol, Jeon-dol. Where is our cutie pie? It's time for your meal. Where are you, Jeon-dol? Jeon-dol! Where is the damn cat? Oh, what's the matter? I thought you'd be in bed by now. Oh, um... Uh... Is the room not warm enough? No, it's warm. - Would you like some soup? - Yes, thank you. - It's perfect for winter, isn't it? - Yes. Where is the cat? Is it at the rut or something Where is this wretched cat? The raindrops dripped on your raincoat Like tears that gushed from my heart I know you live a meager life In my sleep, I pray you'd get a little rest by a fireside The raindrops fall silently Like the cold silent tears surging from my heart What the heck. Let go. You... - What? - You're... Get your hand off. Help! Hae-ran! Hey, Hae-ran. Is that you? Do I know you? Are you Heung-ju? Why did you come after me like a mad man? Why didn't you say it was you? Hey. - Do you remember? - Remember what? When we... What? What is there to remember? Why should I remember? When we fought with the riot police. Remember that summer? Tear bombs were flying everywhere. We inhaled so much tear gas that day. And later went to a disco club to treat ourselves. Hey. Come here. - Let's dance. - Oh, no. Come on. Come here. Let's dance like the old times. Would you stop touching me? What's wrong with that? We're all going to become dusts anyway. - Come here. - No, don't. - Just one dance. - No. - Just like the old days. - I'm exhausted. - Huh? - I'm tired. Sit down. You look like a court jester. Jester? My lord! Entertain away! Hae-ran! Hae-ran! - Kneel. - Hae-ran, you clown. Clown? I'm the master here. Come here and service me, this instant! Ouch, that hurts. You're funny. Hey. I'm cute, aren't I? Bollocks! Come on. Can I have a kiss? On my cheek? Please. You're hopeless. Call Eun-ju. You can have the kiss if she's okay with it. Really? - Yes. - You promise? - Yes. As if you could call her. - If she says okay, you have to kiss me on the lips. - Right on the lips. - I can do more than that. After that... - Call her. - Okay. But I'm going to have a drink first! Honey! It's me. I'm... I'm going to kiss Hae-ran. Do you mind? - Huh? - What does she say? She says okay. Let me talk to her. - You wanna? - Yes. Go ahead. Eun-ju, do you mind? What did I say? Okay. So now... What's the matter with you? You thought I was really going to do it, didn't you? That's not important. Ah, it's nice and windy. You know when... The wind feels like the waves. Waves. Do you still write? What an expression. "The wind blows like the waves" I want to go to the beach. - Beach? - Yes. Shall we go? - It's cold. - We can go when it's not cold. We... Hey. Do you hear that? Be quiet. - It's a woman screaming. - Nonsense! It's the wind. Hey, I heard it. Maybe I'm wrong. It's spooky. It's all because of you. If you hadn't chased me like a crazy jerk... You know when... Remember when he passed away, I locked myself up in my room and drowned myself in booze. You came slamming the door open shouting. "You fool!" You smashed me on the back. It left a clear mark. But, somehow I felt relieved. - Are you... - Oh, don't start. I don't want to hear about. I don't want to think about it. I don't want to think about him. What's wrong? What is wrong? Are you choking? Huh? What's the matter? Are you all right? I'm fine. Let's stop drinking. Let's call it a night. - Get up. Let's go. - Hey. Huh? Do you still chew your filter? What the... Sir, what are you doing here? Is that a cigarette? You can't smoke here. Put it out now! Right now! What is this? What are you doing? Just what do you think you're doing? Let me see your ID. Show us your ID. Oh. Hear me out. I had no idea. Can you let it go this time? Sir, don't you realize that it's a violation? - No, well... - Hand over the ID. ID, please. Ah, you stink. - Write it down. - Yes. Do it quick. What? Be still. You'd better be quiet. Be careful next time. Sorry. Go home. Why are you out here? - Huh? - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - You weren't in the room so... - Isn't this pretty? - What? Isn't this pretty? It's dangerous. It's strange. The ice doesn't feel cold at all. It's dangerous. Hey! Don't step on it. It's dangerous. Hey, ugh... Hey! - What? - Go back to sleep. - What's the matter? - What? - What?s going on? - What? Huh? It's dangerous over there. I broke up with Sang-jin. When? No, no. Hey! It's dangerous. Go back, will you? Hey! - This is pretty. - Careful! Why are you... It's dangerous. Stay there. I'll come over. Stay there, huh? Stay there. Stay still! Will you stay still! Why are you yelling at me? - Stay still. It's dangerous. - I'm fine. It's fine here! I said fine but why are you yelling? I'll come over. Stay there, huh? Hey! What's wrong? Huh? What is it? Talk to me! If you don't talk, how am I supposed to know? Am I a nobody? Am I a nobody to you? What am I? Are you okay? Stay still. Are you okay? What are you crying about? Don't. - Stop crying. Be a man. - What? I'm the one who should be crying. It's nice out here. Isn't it? You think? Let's lie down. - Are you still crying? - Stop it. - Are you? - I said stop it. Don't. Hey, let me have your arm. There are so many stars. Yes. Have you finished crying? Are you done crying? - Stop it. - You're a disgrace. - Don't. - You're a disgrace. Stop it. I'm not crying. Thanks. Are you looking for something? What are you looking for? Um, I think I left my phone here. - May I look around? - Of course. Go on. Thank you. Would you like me to help you? Yes, thank you. I don't think it's here. Are you all right? Are you feeling all right? Take your time. I don't think it's here. No. I'm sorry to bother you. Do you have something important saved on your phone? Well, pictures and... I do hope you find it. It's all I have. You can buy another one. That wouldn't be mine. I see. Let me try to find it. Would you come back in the morning If you want, you may stay until you're content. It doesn't seem like it's here, does it? No. Are you all right? I don't know. I should go. Thank you. Ma'am. Come back tomorrow morning. I'll look for it thoroughly. Wait. What? I think there's someone. Wait. Be quiet. No, no. There's no one. Oh, goodness. Really? You scared me. Put it out. Well get in trouble. Oh, you really scared me. - You want one? - No, thanks. - Don't lie. - I don't want one. I don't want to smoke. When is your T.A. contract due? In a half year. Heavens! Heavens! You know what? I looked into your notebook. There was a phone number to your unit office, that I understood. But what's 'Mr. Kim's laundry? Do you do your senior's laundry? That's one of my most important duties. Anyway, underneath that you wrote down that poem. I wrote poems on the street to be cautious about irresponsible metaphors of nature. The imagination of the streets was a pain and I loved it. However, I still believe the greatest aphorism is in nature. The belief someday will call me. I am ready to answer it. It looks like it is going to snow. You should keep writing. It's nice. I like it here. Hey! I can't? Of course you can't. You have to ask first. Can I kiss you? Yes. Look. What are you doing? Be careful. That looks fun. Oh, no. Hello? Hey! Would you help me? Don't move. Hold on. Stay there. Slowly. Slowly. It's all right. I got you. Okay, slowly. If you stay still... You're doing great. I got you. Do you think you can come over here? Are you okay? Oh, no! Are your legs okay? - How is the army treating you? - Pardon? - I guess you're a newbie? - Yes. How is it? - It must be cold. - It's okay except for the cold. Will you excuse me... - Why? It's cold outside. - I'm going for a smoke. Do you have a cold? I think I'm coming down with one. Are you a couple? No, not a couple. It's complicated. Where are you from? - Seoul. - I'm from Seoul too. I came here with my husband but I lost him. Really? Shouldn't you be looking for him? Somebody's upset right now. - Who? Your husband? - No, me. My husband also? Why? You know, it's like a daily ritual. "What did you say?" "What did you say?" "It's over." Then we broke off. I couldn't find him since. He must be somewhere. Maybe at the restaurant? He must be worried about you. Nah. I'm sure he's enjoying his time off from me. So how did he get his leave? Are you visiting him? Yes. My husband also served his time here. - In Chuncheon? - Yes. I also visited him. We weren't a couple then. But we ended up marrying each other. Are you uncomfortable? I feel hot. I must be warming up. You really don't have to stay. I'm feeling better, really. We're fine. I mean it. I feel bad about taking your precious time. You don't have to. - It's dark... - It's dark. I didn't think the ice would break so easily. It seemed solid when I stepped on it. I thought it would be fine. It serves me right for not being careful. I thought I was in a romantic scene of a movie. I was enjoying the sky, the sound of the water, the stars... at least until I made a fool of myself. I think my foot's getting better now. You have... You have cute toes. I have webbed toes, like a frog's. Can you do this? It's okay. I'll show you something funny. I can stretch them like this. Friends called me "frog toes" I can do that too! - Really? - Yes. Not many people can do this. You don't want to show me, do you? I don't like my toes. I know. I have a younger brother who used to tease me about my toes. I thought everyone's toes looked like this. Oh really? Is he good to you? Yes, he's a good person. Good person? He looks like a nice guy. He doesn't worry you? He's sweet, nice... Too nice. I wouldn't be so sure. I've known him for a while. About three and a half years? Since college. How long have I known my husband? I also knew him from college. Three and a half years? And then... We got married a few years later. Let's go. - Thank you. - Be careful. - Step here. - Yes. I'm getting sweaty. Let's go up. We're almost there. - Shall we take a break here? - Yes. - I'm giving you a hard time, aren't I? - No, it's fine. - You should go now. - No. We're almost there. It's flat from here. I'll be fine. - We'll walk you back. - I'll be fine. Take her home. It's late. - Are you sure you'll be okay? - Of course. I don't want to trouble you anymore. - It's really fine with us. - No, no. Enjoy the stars, wind... I want to enjoy some time alone. Don't worry about me. You should go. - Take care. - Yes. Thank you. Don't worry about anything. Everything will be fine. - Shall we shake hands? - Yes. - Thank you so much. - Not at all. Take care. - Be careful. - Yes. I left my leaf boat by the pond As mommy is putting me to bed, I'm thinking about my boat It must be floating gently on the pond Like the blue moon and the white cloud Do I seem like I hate you? W... Do I seem like I hate you? No, but... but I think you would. No. I thought you hated me. I... I don't know. I know... I know you've been unhappy. I don't know I don't know how to talk to you. I... just don't know. Everything seems... It feels static somehow, I really don't know anymore. It was beautiful. What was? I thought... you were happy to be with me. So I stayed with you. But from some point, you didn't seem happy. You didn't seem to need me. It's not about what I need. It's important that you're with me. I get lonely. It doesn't feel like you're with me even when you're with me. Are you on vacation? Oh, not on vacation. I had some stuff to take care of. If you don't mind me asking, how old are you? - I was born in the year of the monkey. - Oh, me too. - I think we've been on this cab. - Really? When? How could you tell? That nail polish on your little finger... - Oh, this? My daughter is a manicurist. - I see. Will you be okay? Don't you want to look for your phone? No. It must be nice to travel together. Excuse me, could you pull over? Huh? Please pull over. Why? Here? Yes. Could you pull over right there? - I'm sorry Just a minute. - Okay. Honey. Eun-ju.
