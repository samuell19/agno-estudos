THREE DAYS TO LIVE You feel better now? - Yes, I'm fine. It's very kind of you. I'll never forget Dédé's wedding! I probably drank too much after repast. After, during and before. You're right. Fortunately we're not playing tomorrow because I wouldn't be fresh. Mind you, for the little I have to do. Entering and leaving in a play that I know by heart. When only one role would really satisfy me. - Lorenzo of Medicis? You'll have it one of these days, I'm certain. When Alexandre will retire. But you'll see. He'll never retire. He'll die on stage! It almost happened last year in Marseilles. You remember that incident backstage? If the cops hadn't come to his rescue... - You're unfair! Alexandre has his flaws but he really loves theatre. That's why he murders it every night. The proverbial "crime of passion". "I killed her because I loved her too much." My dear friends, It is as the oldest and the best of your comrades that I'll speak first. And that's why I raise this cup to love without which things would be only what they are. Simon, how are you? - I've never been better. Can I continue? - I'm sorry. I will be very brief, my dear children. I will just add that, a little late perhaps: Be fruitful and multiply yourselves so that perpetuates the great family of theatre. Our only family. The most beautiful of all. Bravo, my dear Alexandre! I'd like to go home now. - Me too but we can't before the boss' speech. Speak of the devil... - My dear children, our camaraderie born to the sources of success, cemented by ovations, is still running in what we've preserved from the exhilaration of glory: our heart. Who could think, seeing us so familiarly gathered around this table, the rest of us, so humble, that we've brought forward the jewels of our repertoire from Biarritz to Ostend, from Nice to Deauville. He meant to Villeret-Sur-Mer. We have triumphed everywhere. As usual. And our glorious curtain falls today on the most charming of all love pages. That's why, so often applauded, we may be permitted to applaud in our turn! Boss, we must go now. - No more nonsense! The hardest part's over, you know. Good night, Mom. My children, father Bianchi promises you a hell of a honeymoon: we'll tour Brittany during ten days. Brittany! A guaranteed success! I made a triumph at the Brest Paladium with Ruy Blas. My partner was Ducaille. The Richelieu theatre tours in Canada, Marigny tours in London. They beg me. They wait for us. We could play in Plougalou on the 12th and then Plougastel. It must be very frisky there in November. - It's us who create a warm atmosphere. We will impose "Lorenzaccio" into the Breton cottages. That's the mission of the pioneer. - I'd rather be a pioneer in the south. We went there last year during the open season with "The 3 Musketeers". I remember very well. - Them too. - What does it mean? - Nothing. Boss, I'll go to bed now. Good evening. Dear maestro. - Good night, kid. I remember that evening in Brest, I almost had to make an announcement. Yes, I was voiceless. It's Ducaille that told me about this drug. Coquelin the elder was using the same. Three pinches in each nostril and instantly... Good bye. See you tomorrow. - Good night. You saw who shot? - Yes. As the only witness to the murder you must sign your statement at the precinct. Please, captain. - Excuse me. Please. Lucien Morinzo, France Soir. You knew that Luigi Ponzo was a big shot? - Luigi Ponzo? Yes, the guy that got shot in front of you. Shaking down all joints in Montmartre, he was probably shaken down by a rival. Do you think you can recognize the murderer? - I think so... Wait! He's not sure! You want to take a picture of me? - We wanted to. You said you were two meters behind the murderer. Did you see him or not? Yes or no? Well? Yes, probably. - Good. Clear out! We're going to take a photo. Hey kiddo, take a beautiful portrait of him. What's your name, sir? - Simon Belin. - B.E.L.I.N.? - That's it. It's noted. Clear out, please. Come on! That's it. Another one. "Because of the discretion of Mario, the Navaire's bartender, and his clients, the police will have to make do with a single testimony, the one made by Mr. Simon Belin, a young talented actor. The coolness shown by the actor during the shooting in Clichy suggests that no blackmailer will be able to intimidate him." I would've been terrified. - Come on! If they arrest the murderer, will you witness against him? Of course. Even if... it's dangerous? Dangerous? It's true that if you had to be afraid, you would've been so last night. Obviously. Your fees for Chartres, Le Mans and Nogent-le-Rotrou. Alright, boss. It'll be done by tomorrow. My little Simon, here you are! Loyal to the job! Bravo. They just told me. Let me kiss you. You know it is my heart that speaks. Listen, Mr... - No "Mr." between us! Call me Charlie. Your faithfulness allows you. I was afraid you got an offer from Darquil and passed over to the enemy. It'd mean the end of your career. You know, Darquil is a slave trader! An awful pimp! Come here, son. I have a surprise for you. Now, what do you think of that? I thrust you to the top of the bill right away! Jeanne and Dédé will spend the night sticking that poster everywhere. I'll buy them new brushes. And tomorrow, at Meudon, we'll have a full house! The Clichy massacre's witness in the flesh and in the role of Lorenzo! Perfectly! Starting tomorrow, you'll play Lorenzo! Well, Mr. Bianchi... - I told you to call me Charlie! Lucky guy! At your age I was still stuck in backstage. I was doing the crowing of the cock. In The Passion of the Christ. If I had Charlie Bianchi as a director, I'd be playing Salle Richelieu right now. That's life... But you have me. Enjoy yourself! Go and try your costume with Jeanne. Alexandre's taller, hems will be necessary. Come on, run! You spoiled kid! It's not a matter of money, I told them. You'll never see Alexandre Berimont on TV. Even for buckets of money. Speaking of money, I'm a little short these days... Could you give me a small advance? - I can pay you Fontainebleau and Melun. You couldn't go as far as Montargis? I wonder what you do with your money. I despise money! You see, kid... Theatre is a vocation! It's a church! Even when the church has for sexton a jackass like... My dear Alexandre, you're just in time. I have to talk with you. At your orders, Mr. Director. My dear child, I compliment you! At your age, press clippings always warm the heart. I've been there. In the theatrical section though. Whatever. Little Suzie Rouf made a name for herself absorbing veronal. It led her to cinema. People say idiots are not mean. He's a poor soul. But I don't think he's stupid. He's mean. Really mean. Maybe more but I think he's aware of that. We are always clairvoyant about ourselves. Take me, for instance. I started here as a dresser. Bianchi tried to turn me into a stage actress. That's why every evening I dress up as Susanne, Roxanne or Madame Bonacieux. At least it can't be said that the costumes don't fit me well. I don't know how to act but I know how to sew. While you, even in Alexandre's rags, you will be a wonderful Lorenzo. How do you know that? Because I know Bianchi very well and... I think that sometimes luck arranges many things. Well, kids... I almost caused a stir. One word more and I was down to Darquil. But this old scoundrel knows his limits. He caved in. I had already decided that I would only play the Cardinal. Take it or leave it. You see, kiddo... Whatever the taste of the public for what has made our reputation, we need to renew. Otherwise...it's sclerosis. I was Lorenzo more than 300 times. The harvest is done! To others the gleaning. There you are, livid face? If Republicans were men, what revolution tomorrow in the city. But Pierre is an ambitious; only the Rucellai are worth something. It would be nice for him to come and to tell me: "Is your room remote? Would we hear something in the neighborhood?" Yes, it'd be nice if such an idea came to him. Well, I have an incredible urge to dance! If I let myself go, I could jump like a sparrow on all those big plaster and beams! Hey, cute boy! Put your new gloves and a finer coat. Make yourself beautiful, your bride is beautiful. But I tell you in the ear, beware... of her little knife. You were wonderful! Bravo, bravo Simon! - Thanks! My little rascal! Let me kiss you! I put this thing on 300 times. I played it. But it's the first time I've heard it. Thanks. I'm not into shape yet but in 2 or 3 days... - Shut up, you were stunning. Brilliant! Brilliant! He's embarrassing all of us! You know, you were pretty good, you too. Excuse me, sir. Are you Simon Belin? Certainly not. - Who are you looking for? - Simon Belin. - In the backstage. You are Simon Belin? - Yes, why? A summons from the judge. It comes from Paris. "Purpose of the summons: Testimony. Presence mandatory." I cannot let go of the tour just when... I'm going to say that I'm sick. - They will summon you again. When is it? - Tomorrow. This is only a rehearsal. The trial is the real thing! We're going to send this bastard to a trial in a moment! I count on you. - What if it was a mistake? What if it's not the same guy? - Why do you say that? They wouldn't have summoned you. Nobody is more serious than these people. Mr. Belin. It's me. You have your summons? - Here it is. Judge Doillon is expecting you. Please. - Thanks. I think it is not necessary to remind you the importance of your testimony. It is crucial. Strong suspicion are hanging over the man to whom we will confront you. His name is Lino Ferrari, Ex-convict and notorious hoodlum. 8 arrests. 8 dismissal of the charges. Be reassured, Mr. Belin. You're in no danger. Do not let him intimidate you. And answer as you are certainly determined to do. In good faith and in good conscience. Let him in, please. - Yes, sir. Mr. Belin, do you recognize this man as the killer you saw on Clichy street? I remind you that you said in your testimony that you could recognize without hesitation Luigi Pozzo's murderer. Is it him? Well? Is it him? Considering that no mitigating circumstances could be retained in his favor the accused is sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Ferrari, do you want to say something? - Yes. We'll meet again, you have my word. 20 years, thanks to us! Wonderful! I have booked a table at Krafft's. We'll have a Champagne supper! Bravo for your testimony. It was great. Go on. Perfect! Another one from here. Wait! That's Glory for him! Female admirers! You were at the testimony? - Yes. - He was smashing. He was wonderful. - He'll make a sensational article. A last photo and we're off. Hey, Simon, you're coming? We'll exit through the backstage! - My boy! Late again! You arrive at the final curtain as usual! How did it go? - Very well. You're ungrateful. Three columns in the evening edition! Including two about Lino Ferrari. I would have preferred four lines, four small lines... on Lorenzaccio. This car is yours? - Yes. Every third day, the rest of the time it's in repair. Can I drive you home? - I live far from here. Never mind. It depends on her, you know. Where do you stay? - Etoile Street, Hotel Bijou. Bianchi has a discount with them. Probably the same with Le Select, Caulaincourt St. I don't mind. I have a bathtub. It could be called a bathroom if it had hot water. Bianchi has gone crazy. You have thrilled him. In any case, it does not seem mutual. It would be, if he was the director of Théatre Antoine or L'Atelier. But as long as he walks his zoo on provincial boards... Thanks for the zoo. - I'm part of it, you know. I'm even the main "attraction". This is not possible. The only thing possible with this car is to go slower. The night you played "Lorenzo" for the first time, I almost cried. Me too, I almost cried. Playing Musset under those conditions... Thank you for taking me home. I'm sure you'll get a big role in Paris. The zoo will miss you. - You know, I'm not there yet. It depends on a thousand things or next to nothing... What do you mean by next to nothing? Well, for instance... You and me.... Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? I'm really serious about it. I suppose that you misunderstood me. - On the contrary. I understood you right away. When you asked me to take me home I knew where we were going. That's what's so great about living in a hotel. I like you, Simon. I even like you... - Too much. Too much. That's what you were about to say. You're afraid to fall in love with me. Afraid to make a mistake, to spoil a beautiful friendship. You only want to say good evening to me. Well then, good evening Jeanne! - In short, you have a bad temper. Not at all. But when a woman talks about friendship to a man... TONIGHT IN VERSAILLES Lisieux, Rouen, Le Havre... What is this? - Our route. Bianchi's sending us to Normandy in the cold season and in empty theaters! I'm fed up! Pesteguy has offered you a role. Why don't you go and see him? He offered me a small walk-on part. I will have three words to say. - If you say them well, you'll be noticed... and in the next play... - I'll have four words! You must try your luck. You must show him you have talent. For instance, "Love Stories" the meeting scene. I marked your lines. Ok, let's try. - Remind me the beginning. Here, take a bit of cake, maybe you'll find in it some bit of candle... Ah, yes. Here, take a piece of cake... - A bit of cake. A bit... Here, take a bit of cake, maybe you'll find in it some bit of candle, it's a birthday cake. I just turned 18 this morning. It was not necessary to put candles, it shows you're 18, it's so obvious. You have pretty eyes. Blue or green? Like some small drops of water in them... It seems there are days when they're blue. It's probably a question of lightning. No, that ain't it at all. You sound like you don't believe it yourself. But you must believe it! She's a clumsy clot. A real one. A woman in love. Try again. It seems there are days when they're blue. It's probably a question of lightning. I like the eyes that change. I promise you that they will change every day. Really? You know your lines but you're not credible. You must say that laughing. They're in love but they're also joyful. This is not incompatible. Come on! This text sounds wrong, impossible to recite... - Everything can be recited! Shakespeare, Eugène Sue, the Bible... Even "The French Hunter"! All that is written is made to be played! It's your job to bring some style when the writer has none. And it happens very often, you know. Well...You want me to try again? It's no use. Anyway, Pesteguy will never audition me. I'll still go and see him. Because in the end I'd rather be the last in Paris that the first in Rouen. Unless... - No. Certainly not! I'm very happy with you, my darling, but I would feel guilty if you stayed because of me. Don't try to make me happy, Simon. Talk to Bianchi and go see Pesteguy as soon as tomorrow. Something's wrong? It's about Bianchi, I'd rather... No, it's alright. - You'd rather have me talking to him. Can you imagine? Mister Simon enter at the Daumont. As what? As a sweeper? He will still play Lorenzo tonight in Lisieux but tomorrow in Rouen, 120,000 habitants... You reprise your role. Note that I never had any doubt about you. - Me neither, my dear Director. So, I'll write to you in Rouen, general delivery. If all goes well, you'll come to me. - Of course. If all goes wrong... See you in Normandy. I'm gonna miss you, Jeanne. A lot. Come on, kids! On our way! We have 200 km ahead of us. We can't travel on an empty-stomach. Since the birth of the kid she's eating for two! Dédé... You'll check the costumes. Shorten the sleeves and let out the pants. Alexandre will play "Lorenzo" once again. - Poor guy. He is excited. - I meant "Lorenzo". I know Alexandre is bad. He's bad but he's staying with us. Staying even when you're a nuisance to everyone. That's what I call being faithful! Listen to Europe Flash hosted by Jacques Deray Many news this morning, the most important comes from the police headquarters. The gangster Lino Ferrari, sentenced to 20 years for murder, escaped last night from the Meulun jail. According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the bandit would have benefited from external help. Roadblocks were dressed at once by the Police Force in the departments of Seine, Seine-et-Oise and Seine-et-Marne. In well-informed circles people think that Ferrari won't escape for long from the searches which target him. In this regard, Captain Duret seemed adamant this morning. Lino Ferrari's description follows: 1.75 meter, stocky, dark hair, hooked nose with a slight deviation of the left septum. After this news items... - What's the matter with you? Why are you staring at me? What's the matter? He escaped. And he'll get caught, that's all. They're all scared shitless! - Well, I do admire you! I'm a man. I was in the war. Irregular forces. I got two medals. In your place, I would be scared witless. Me too... - Don't show off again. I'm sure that he's seeking a hideout. - Maybe you should do the same. Why? He won't be able to go very far. You heard the radio. You heard it yourself. The Captain was adamant. Alright then, kids! It's time to go. How much? - Let me pay, boss. Let's go! What are we waiting for? Lino Ferrari? You have guts, kid! I'm telling you! You still plan to go to Paris tomorrow? - I think so. He will probably be arrested by tomorrow. Will they arrest him before or after he gets to me? Mr. Belin! Simon Belin? It's me! - A phone call from Paris. It's probably Pesteguy. Ah, Mr. Berimont! - You're still here! Any mail for me? - No. Hello? Mr. Belin? - Who's speaking? - It's me. Only three days to live, Simon. I could've come and killed you right away. But I'm giving you time to think about it. Hello? Are you still there? I want you to strive and suffer like I did during 6 months. You'll see, how three days can be a very long time. You'll see. It wasn't Pesteguy? - No. It was... - Yes. He wanted to frighten me. And the bastard succeeded. Come on, you need to rest and relax. We play in two hours. You'd rather not play? I can tell Bianchi, if you want.. I'd rather be on stage than to worry myself sick in my dressing room. I can't let down the author! Alfred wrote this play especially for me. Wrote-to-measure! I wanted to be famous, I woke up from my dream and nothing more. That little bastard of Lorenzo. That little scumbag would say Lino! It's exactly what I need tonight. Ah, Simon, you're here! Isabelle! Therèse! Here, it's yours. Your mind is torturing you. I agree. I was a killing machine. But I was just killing myself. - Why would you want to die? I can only repeat you my own words. Philippe, I've been honest. What's wrong with him? It's the phone call. - What phone call? - He's on his nerves. He's going to crack Yesterday, a burly guy with bare legs, followed me for 15 minutes by the water but he was reluctant to kill me... but... but he was reluctant to kill me... but he was reluctant to kill me... Perhaps he was a starving family man. Ah, Lorenzo, your heart is very sick. Why attribute to the cowardice of the people the respect for the poor? Attribute it to what you want. I'll go for a walk on the Rialto. What's wrong with you? You're sick? Sick with fear. - Oh, please! - I say what I want to say. Go say it on stage. It's your turn, dummy! Lord, you are the Duke of Florence. Prior to receive from my hands the crown that the Pope and Caesar have asked me to put on your head, they ordered me to make you swear 4 things. Pray tell, Cardinal. Do justice unreservedly. Never attempt anything against Charles Quint's authority. Avenge the death of Alexandre. Treat well signor Jules and signora Julia, his natural children. How should I take the oath, Cardinal? On the Gospel. I swear. To God and to you, Cardinal. Now, give me your hand. Thank you for the door! I owe you one. To think that you didn't even come to greet. I hope that our Director will impose sanctions on him. I have 30 years of experience, I have seen many infamies but never... Plum brandy. You're one of the stage actors, right? - Yep. For three more days. The same thing. The same thing. The same thing. What did this man do to me? If I had stayed quiet in the deep of my solitude, he would not come looking for me. But I came looking for him in Florence. Florence... Florence... Come on, go home and leave Florence. I answer for everything... if you leave Florence. I was worrying about you. - You're Florence? Florence or not, take him with you. I have to close shop. Come on, my darling, let's go. I say that poetry is the sweetest suffering. - 150 francs. I pity the poor people but I think, in fact, that they produce great artists. Battlegrounds are a seed for new harvests and severed heads engender celestial wheat. Indeed, indeed. Let's go, my darling. You're going too. Give me 100 francs. Here, drink this. To say that you make yourself ill because of a villain. A villain? The only villain is me. Yes, it's me. When I met Ferrari at the judge's, I had never seen him before. You hear me? Never! Be reassured, I'm completely sobered now. You mean that... it's not Ferrari...? He didn't kill that guy on Clichy Street. I denounced an innocent man. Not completely innocent but at least more than me. I put him in jail for 20 years. To not go back, to support my small advertising campaign, to be popular, to read my name in the papers. "Simon Belin, a talented young lead." I would've had his head cut off to see my own on the front page. My false witness mug, the one you liked so much. Simon, it can't be true... - It is. What do you want me to do? To continue the lies? Aren't you tired of the courageous Simon? You're insatiable! Good Heavens! It's all your fault! Your fault and the others'! Bianchi, Dédé, Therèse.. Even that jerk Alexandre! I didn't dare to walk back. I got carried away by your admiration, the hero myth was running. My pride boosted! Glory and Love, as you said. For a sensitive guy like me, you can't imagine how it feels. The hero has cheated so he's going to die. That's it. It's as stupid as it sounds. My poor Simon... You have to leave. I thought about it. I can follow the tour to Le Havre and then embark to the USA or elsewhere. We could run away together. We could, yes. Meanwhile, you could call the police. False testimony, contempt of court... No thanks! You can ask for a protection without entering in the details. A protection as witness? Why not? In short, you ask me to continue with my lies. Why not? I understand very well, I sympathize with you... but it's a police matter. All I could do was ask for instructions from Paris. They'll probably send an inspector, he could be here by tomorrow morning. Maybe he's already in Rouen and they didn't tell me. Don't you realize that I could be killed from any minute now? Well... - I see. The police promised to protect me in exchange of my testimony. You only did your duty, sir. Ah, it's true, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to have you disturbed. A phone call for you from Paris. - Pesteguy? No, Ferrari. I heard his voice, it was cold and quiet. This man will kill you, Simon. When we're in Le Havre, have your passport stamped and buy a ticket. I mean, our tickets. I only have the money for one ticket. Can't you try asking Bianchi for a loan? If I stay... he can do us this favor. Ok, I'll try. I'm going for a walk, see you later in your dressing room. - Yes. Can you keep my coat? - Yes, see you later. Mr. Bianchi, Miss Jeanne Fortin is wanted on the telephone. It's for you. Excuse me. Thanks. Hello? - It's you? - Yes, Simon. What's wrong? - I'm being followed. - By Ferrari? No, probably one of his thugs. - He's armed? He looks ugly enough to be armed. Well, stay where you are. - I can't stay on the phone all day long! Go out. He won't shoot at you in the street. Sure, sure! And if he shoots, it won't be at you anyway! I'd say the same thing in your place! What are you risking? Maybe it would arrange you. Maybe it would arrange you all. Some good publicity? Bunch of bastards! - Simon! - Simon, Simon... Simon can die! Nobody cares! What will you drink? - Nothing. - 70 francs for the phone call. Inspector Ceccaldi from the police squad. You come from Paris? - Yes, let's go sit there. What will you have? - The same thing as you. 2 Cinzano if you please, Miss. - Alright. You seem pretty jumpy. - Is it amazing? What if you had Ferrari on your heels? - It's him who has us on his heels. Allow me to point out that until now... - Patience! The policeman job is a matter of patience. A matter of death too. - We managed to learn, through an indiscretion, that Ferrari has obtained a fake passport and a plane ticket to Carracas. The plane leaves after tomorrow. We'll wait for him at the airport. But the Captain thinks he might try to reach you in the meantime. That's why I'm here. He already reached me... by phone. - Where did he call from? - From Paris, I suppose. How did he find you? - Probably through the booking agency. What will you do? I'll wait. Keep a low profile. If he smells something, he won't try anything. Is he going to try something? There's a good chance. So you think it's a chance! We hunt the tiger, dear sir. And how do you proceed in a tiger hunt? You tie a goat to a stake and you stay alert. And you assigned me with the role of the goat. That's flattering. Don't worry. This is only in theory. He probably won't move and we'll pick him up at the airport. And meanwhile, we'll have lunch. Yes, the well-known hunting dinner, Inspector... Ceccaldi. Lucien Ceccaldi. Call me Lucien since we're going to spend some time together. I'll call you Simon. You can even call me "my lamb". He calls it the tiger hunt. He's the bookish type. What's with you? Nothing. I only wish you had refrain to say such words on the phone. You know how it is in these cases. I was afraid to die any time. - They were meant to be your last words. You polished them up like yesterday. - Yesterday, I was only drunk... When you're not drunk, you're afraid and viceversa. One way or another, you only have foul words for me. Even if I'm not very touchy... You mistaken me for a saint yesterday. I believed in a miracle! I was only drunk. You also said you were tired of me. Well, tiredness must be a contagious disease. I've long admired you Simon, both on and off stage. I still admire you... but only on stage. Yes. I have to acknowledge that. You're skilled. You do your job very well. You love it more than anything else. It's the only instance when you give something good. I could even say something noble. Talent is convenient. But that doesn't excuse cowardice or boorishness. On stage you beat the drum. Talent, talent... And talent comes as a dog to whom you promise treats. God knows I came many times. You didn't treat me well, you talked badly. I have taken everything because there was a word of love from time to time, a nice look, a tender gesture... The treats tactic. I don't blame you, I didn't need anything more. I didn't mind being unhappy with you as long as you stayed civilized about it. You're packing? - Yes, we won't play tonight. Charlie got into a fight with the Director about the lights. We're leaving for Le Havre at dawn. By the way, about Bianchi and Le Havre... 50,000 francs. Not a cent more, not a cent less. It seemed more painful for him than having a tooth removed. Here. - Thanks. But if Ferrari leaves for Carracas, you don't need to leave anymore. Never mind. I'd rather be cautious and reserve our tickets. Our tickets... What did I say wrong again? - Nothing wrong. On the contrary. You're civilized again. It's very kind of you. You're mad at me? I'm sorry. That idiot cop has frightened me but not the way you think. I wouldn't mind dying if I was alone. Really. Only, I thought... I thought that maybe I would be killed... without seeing you a last time. - No, Simon. I wanted to be in your arms. He could've killed me, it didn't matter as long as I was in your arms. It's strange to say. - To hear too. But carry on. My poor Simon... - It's true. Without you, I'm the poor Simon. The poor and lost Simon. I need you to lend me your hand so badly. I need you to warm me. I need to hurt you so badly. Can I kiss you? What's wrong? Nothing. Kiss me. You should've seen him. When I told him that we were leaving, he turned green. He tried to hold me and almost ripped off my coat. He even had the nerve to get on to me again. A check of 100.000 francs. Guess what I did? You throw it in his face? - Exactly! Nothing surprising about that. Darquil had preceded us. With him, no need to be shy. He's a real doormat. Darquil! Still talking about him. - Wait. I heard that "Mysteries of Chicago" was a good show. Oh, my dear Dédé, all tastes are in nature. The fact that every night I recreate the Medici palace doesn't prevent you from liking the slums of Al Capone. If you prefer toilets to my salons, it's your choice. You can go and work for Darquil too, if you want. It's just a matter of mentality. - For me, it's just a matter of raising and bringing down the curtain. - True! After me you bring down the curtain, after Darquil you flush. I'd rather travel with you. - Fine. Jeanne's not with you? - We'll take her at the hotel. Good bye, Colin. Good bye, sir. Good morning, sir. I'm sorry. All our suites are rented. Just 2 rooms without bathrooms left. And you say this now. We could have been warned way earlier. The customers are required to warn too. We weren't expecting you to arrive today. I'm an actress, my friend. Not a clerk. Belina. Rings a bell? Yes, of course. - It's me. And this is Mr. Davros. Davros! The machine-guns! - The steel industry, my friend. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Davros. We still have the Royal suite... Perfect! Since we're staying for 48 hours we might as well feel comfortable. Bring up our luggages. - Someone will accompany you, Mr. Davros. The Royal suite. This way, lady and gentleman. The apartment is on the first floor. Sir. - I want a room, please. I only have rooms without bathrooms. - I don't care. How long? - Until tomorrow evening. Bring up my suitcase. I'm going out. - Very well, sir. Here's you one-way ticket to New-York. Single cabin. 2nd class. When's your boat leaving? - Tomorrow, at 8. His plane for Carracas takes off at noon. When we nab Ferrari, you'll be at sea. The most important for me is to be at sea in case you don't catch him. Does she know that you leave without her? Who? Do you think it's elegant? In your line of work I guess you have already seen a guy my age fall on the sidewalk with a gut full of lead, right? Sure. Is it elegant? There. It's your boat. To the theatre. When I bought this theater 10 years ago it was rotten to the core. It's good that you're ahead. We'll be able to rehearse. I have some kind of trouble with the lights. - Really? I suppose you have kept them unemployed since the "Mysteries of Chicago"... Darquil's new production? Never! I refused to have it even for a 50/50 split. This Darquil is a wop, a pubber, a thug! A crook! A real crook! Pardon me. Simon Belin, one of my pupils. Simon, the Director. Delighted, sir. I've taught him everything. Breathing, diction... A Bianchi product 100% guaranteed. I'm still very annoyed with this light business. Come on, a man like you cannot be distracted by odds and ends. I wouldn't call lights odds and ends. - So you said that... Darquil was a crook? Programme, ask your programme. I hope we'll have a splendid evening. - My dear Dr, "Lorenzaccio" is a classic. It will rejuvenate you! - Bravo! We need more classics! It's nice, you brought all the family. It seems that it's a show where you can take the kids. It's not like these awful movies full of crimes and naked women. Sure, Musset is different from Le Breton. Cloakroom, cloakroom. This way please. I can't play without my goatee. Have you seen it? Don't answer all at once. Therese? - What? - Seen my goatee? - No. Please, button me up. - I can't. - We raise in 5 minutes! Hurry up! We raise the curtain in 5 minutes. You'll raise without me. - What's wrong? - I resign, that's all. Resignation or not, we raise in 5 minutes. Come on, we must start. - Mounet-Sully is having kittens again. Oh, what a pain in the ass! So what, you have a tantrum? - Not at all. You promised me "Lorenzo". You didn't keep your promise. So I resign, that's all. Are you trying to wind me up? You owe me 200.000 francs. As far as I know you didn't refund any of your advances. So send me a check instead of a resignation letter! - My dear Director... - Stop now! You play or you don't play? - I play. Good! So go put on your cassock! And hurry up! Up in the air! - Yes, Mr. Director. What are you doing here? We're about to start! To the curtain! Would you please button me up? - With pleasure. Is it true that you're a detective? - Yes. You don't look like one. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Not at all. Hurry up, we raise in 2 minutes. We raise in 2 minutes. And then we weigh anchor. Maybe we'll be back with the next boat. The inspector's convinced that Ferrari will be nabbed tomorrow at Orly. It's possible. But I can't rely on possibilities, you know. At least, no phone call today. That's something. Only a few more hours. And then I won't be afraid anymore. How good I'll feel, not afraid anymore. Simon, you're up next - I'm coming. It's our final performance. - Yes. You seem annoyed by our departure. I'll try to get used to it. Would you have preferred me to just leave alone? - Go on, Simon! Switch on the light. You'll see yourself better. You're popular around the city. One of your fans asked me if you were on stage tonight. What's his name? - He said you two have been best friends for 20 years. Where did you meet him? - In town. At the hotel. God damn it! - What's wrong with you? Simon, are we playing tonight or what? It's for tonight. Dédé! Dédé! Tell the boss I'm sick! Tell them what you want! Ferrari is here. - What? - He's here! In Le Havre! He's the devil! But where is that dumb cop? What's the matter? - He's here. He's going to kill me. He's going to kill me! Do something! That's what you're here for, right? I know. - Why are you shouting like that? We hear you from the stage. Ferrari's here. - That's perfect. He'll put his head in the lion's mouth. An arrest is imminent. But it's the inspector's job. Yours is to be on stage. Put your men everywhere in the audience, in the street... I beg you! Leave him alone. He's a pro, you have to trust him. But go on stage right now, please, or they'll break the seats! Where have you seen him? - I haven't. It's Belinda who told me. It was agreed that Belin would play until Rouen and then the boss would give me back his role! My role! But I've just learned that it will never happen. You're irreplaceable as the Cardinal. - Yes, obviously, I know that. But still! A promise is a promise! What now? - Down your cassock! Curtain! All those stubborn republicans plotting against me, I know through Lorenzo. Gentlemen, behold this puny little body. Note the sunken eyes, the ghostly pallor of a face that sometimes smiles but has not the strength to laugh. Is this a man to be feared? You laugh at him. Hey, Renzo! Come here! Good day to you, my cousin's friends. Sir Maurice thinks you're dangerous. The Cardinal too. Dangerous to whom, Eminence? Court dogs can have rabies like other dogs. A priest insult must be in Latin. I know Tuscan insults that can be answered. Sir Maurice, I didn't see you. You look just fine and your coat seems brand new. - Like your minds. - Cousin, when you're tired of one of your many conquests made in the suburbs, send her to Sir Maurice. - In your place, I would take a sword. If they told you that I was a soldier, this is a mistake. Your mind is a sharp sword. This is too vile a weapon; everyone makes use of his own weapon. Come on, Renzo, I want to serve you as a witness. Give him a sword! Monsignor, what do you say? - Well! You shudder, cousin? His Highness laughs at me. Curtain! Curtain! Curtain! Empty the theatre! Heard that? - The inspector probably shot Ferrari! Simon, why did you run away like that? Calm down! Calm down! Let's not panic! A publicity trick like this was suicidal! Another scandal for my theatre! A scandal is always good business. You have to take advantage of it. Stretcher! Hurry up! Move away people! Don't shoot! Why are you doing this? It's important for me to do it. Let's say that I want to save you. Who? Me? You... and him. They are not there. - They must be at the police station. I suppose we'll have to go to. Ferrari probably ran away just after he shot our man. Alert all police squads. I want blockades everywhere, mainly on the roads to Paris. We'll take care of the harbor station and boarding offices. - At your orders. Where can I make a phone call here? - Follow me, sir. I want all your actors in my office at 9 sharp. Alright, Captain. What now? Why don't you give the alarm? Maybe I'm not ready to die. - So you read the papers and bought that crap story? The Clichy killer, Luigi Pozzo's murderer? When your boyfriend accused me I had never killed anyone! Never! And the inspector? - He was pointing his gun at me. What else could I do? Bastier, watch the corridor. Okay, boss. - You, the theatre. - OK. And you, the stage door. - At your orders. You stay here. You will be relieved at 8. Call me if there's something unusual. Okay, boss. - Looks like another sleepless night for us. Here. I don't want you to die. Even of a cold. I didn't imagine you taking care of me. - Don't even bother. Patter and compliments are not my style. We'll go through the window. Where are you taking me? - To your hotel. He may be there already. If he's not, we'll wait for him together. What if I refuse? - You won't refuse. I may have an idea in mind, but you have one too. And I don't really think it's the same. What's wrong with you? Marcel! Raymond! A weird guy just bumped into me. He looked like an actor. Go to the end of the corridor. We stay here. - Okay. Jeanne! She left! She left with him! Do you understand what it means? She left with him! Come on, man, calm down! There's enough violence for tonight! I must find her! I must find her! - It's the police's job! Everything you tried to catch Ferrari has failed so far! You're still alive at the cost of one of our men's life! You're going to wait quietly here! We will keep you informed. Take the key to room 12. He's not there. Your key is still on the rack. I'm not living here but I booked this room to be sure not to miss him. Did Simon Belin and her ladyfriend come back? No, their key is still on the rack. Their friends are having dinner next. OK. Give me the key. Now we just have to wait for him. Will you be more advanced when you have killed him? Certainly not. But I escaped from jail in that end. Only in that end? - Yes. And the plane to Carracas? Don't move. We'll wait for them at the restaurant next. - Sure, emotion gives you a real appetite. Carracas, it's only to reassure my friends but I can tell you the truth now. You were mistaken. You could make a more serious mistake by killing Simon. I have to close the loop. It all started with a mistake and all will end with a mistake. I didn't start this, your boyfriend did. In the judge's office he thought he recognized you but he was wrong. After that, it was too late. - He never recognized me. A head like mine, it's hard to forget. And I know who killed Pozzo. You know the killer and you didn't denounce him? - You're funny. Given the bad company I keep, if I had your boyfriend's mentality, I would spend my life in a police station. Turn off the light. You've been living with him for a long time? About 6 months. And...you love him? We sleep in the same bed. He had no one else, me neither. I admit that you had to feel pretty alone to end up in the bed of that jerk. But to stick with him, after all that fuss... I won't stay with him, no matter what. And the boat? You don't leave with him? Let's just say he's leaving without me. If you let him leave. Damn, they can't stay down there all night! They take their time, perhaps we could take ours. Why are you smiling? - Because you can't buy me with sex. Decidedly! You're so romantic! And what you're doing right now, it's romantic? You know that his boat leaves tomorrow at 8. You just want me to miss him. But I know that from the start. Maybe we could try to forget everything for a while. It's funny how simple people can be sometimes complicated. I save your life, you take me to your room, and you get mad when I start to undress. You're too suspicious, do I look like I feel guilty? I'm just saying that you're losing your time. We might as well lose it enjoying ourselves. You might change your mind. - I'm not the kind of guy who misses an appointment. Siimon, open the door! It's me! Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid anymore. I killed Ferrari. The consequences of your act will be the least painful possible. I promise. Thank you, Captain. I'm sorry... but I can't take any more. During 3 days Simon has suffered, struggled and called for help... but no one wanted to hear him, no one tried to understand him. We did our best to protect him. Me too. But you didn't know him. Even I knew him so little. I did to him the worst thing a woman can do to a man: I felt sorry for him. Miss, please. May I? They told me he's been arrested. He's dead. I read your letter. You were so afraid of losing me? It's the only thing I wasn't afraid of for three days. THE END Translation by: aloysius70 for CG Timings and proofreading by: marooned2 for CG
