Right. Now, pull out the slipper. You whack him.. once, again.. and again! Hey! Are you just going to yell 'ah ah'? You've got to go tag your partner. Idiots! Hey! You've got to look reluctant! Do it! Re..luctant..ly! Now, Yubiho comes into the ring. /Oh, and I'm playing Yubiho? Not that you're.. Alright, enter Yubiho. Asura X, acts scared and retreats a little. As you retreat you do the slipper attack again. You get hit. You take it away from him and throw it away. Next.. you flip Asura X on to the floor. Let's just say we did it. Fall down. Practice getting flipped! Right. Next, Yubiho climbs onto the rope.. ..and performs his special trick a mid-air, triple-spin body press! Why no body press? Come on, how could I possibly do that? Just pretend. Just act it out! Okay, Asura X. You're in pain.. and you can't see a way out of this.. ..then take two fingers.. spread them and poke Yubiho in the eyes! You didn't have to poke me so hard! /Well, he told me to do it! What the hell are you guys doing? /Look what he did to my eyes! Oh, get up. Do I still have to keep on cheating in the ring? A wrestler who cheats either loses by default, or by a technical ruling. Okay, get up. Now, Yubiho continues with a double Karate-chop. Twice. /Twice? Bounces off the ropes and drop kicks. I get slapped again? Why do I always get hit? You don't want to do it? Then quit! Dae-Ho. Why don't you have a look at this? /What is it? It's a book on wrestling techniques and video. Hey, this is in Japanese.. There are many photos.. it should be easy. Right. Thanks. Min-Young, I'll work hard. The Animal Kingdom Choi Doo-Shik, get in the car. That's all right. I prefer to walk. I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. Got any plans this evening? Nothing special, right? Come over to Madam Oh's Karaoke. You've met Mr. Hwang? He'd like to buy you a drink. For me? Here you are. /What's this? You know, it's an application for that loan. You said that you needed more information for the paperwork, right? Well, the deputy-manager here took care of all the details. We'd like you to take care of it right away. And be sure to show up later. Do you like the 'Animal Kingdom'? Pardon? When you watch it you learn the rules of survival.. it's all there. The will of nature, survival of the fittest, etc.. I embrace nature's wisdom.. learn its philosophy.. marvel at its cruelty.. Autumn's already over. Have a good evening. Are you going home? Yes, good bye. /See you tomorrow. Hey, Dae-Ho! /They've changed the security guard. Yeah, guess the deputy-manager didn't like him and replaced him. Going somewhere? /Why do you ask? Let's go have a drink. /I can't. I have to go. Every evening you're going somewhere. I've got something to discuss. Let's go. /I said I can't. Where in the world are you going, hmm? I said, where are you going? Doo-Shik! Listen carefully to what I have to say. This is no joke. I'm on my way to practice wrestling. All right. I got it. I got it. So let's go and have a drink, okay? I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier. You're disappointed in me, aren't you? I know, I know. I'm really sorry. But I have to tell you, I'm a real wrestler. I wear a mask as well. I understand.. go.. just leave. Go and wrestle. Ha, I've seen guys who refuse to drink due to their father's passing.. ..but this is the first time I've seen someone leave to go wrestling. Ms Jo, Ms Jo! Oh, you're here. Have you been drinking? Well, seems like you drink every evening.. What? You think I'm drunk? You think I'm drunk, don't you.. Coach, may I have the key? The key... The desk drawer? You think wrestling's a show... Life's a show, bastard.. Pick it up. What the fuck is this? It's been difficult for us all. Don't be too disappointed.. Go back to your seat. Yes, sir. Yes, this is Choi Doo-Shik. Yes, that's correct. Right. No, I can't, it's just not possible. How many times have I told you? What part of the word 'no' don't you understand? Hello! Who's yelling? Hello.. Wh..what? You son of a bitch! Don't dis me just because I work at a desk! Burn me or bury me, it's up to you, bastard! I'm not arguing with a mother fucker like you! Hang up, prick! What the hell are you doing? What? Want me to quit? I will! Hey, Doo-Shik! The Back Drop of Sadness Well, since everyone's pretty much in a gloomy mood.. ..our deputy-manager's inviting you all out for a drink at Madam Oh's this evening. Hope you can all come. Also for next week's get-together for sushi, we'd like everyone's participation. In behalf of our deputy-manager, I thank you in advance. That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, I'd like to introduce our angel of the bank accounts, our own Ms Jo! Hey, great title. "The way you look at me.. with that smile on your face". Applaud! Ms Jo! Please don't cry for me.. Hey, Jo Eun-Hee! Please don't weep for me.. Please don't look at me like that.. With your meaningless smile.. Think they make a good couple? /They certainly do. Those two? /What, you don't think so? How about you, do they look good to you? Yo, Ms Jo, do you think you 'spark' when you're singing with Mr. Park? Hey, what are you going to do? Now love is.. Take your hands off! Bastard! You think the world's that easy? Who is it? Dae-Ho? Have you been drinking? Yes.. but I'm sober now. What happened? What's wrong with your face? It's nothing. I'm okay. Uh, Min-Young.. I have a favor.. [ Skipped item nr. 536 ] Can you help with my back drop? What? Back drop.. O.K. Hold from the back, tight.. tighter! Open up! Now, flip me. What the? You've gotta help me flip you.. Think Yubiho's gonna help you? Now try and flip me. One.. Two.. Three! You O.K.? You like flowers? What? Oh, yeah.. here. Is your neck alright? Uh, I've been meaning to ask.. ..the Coach, your father, wasn't he the Ultra Tiger Mask? It was him, right? I was a great fan of his. I heard. My father told me when you got here.. ..said you were weird. Dae-Ho.. Why'd you take up wrestling? Um, why did I start? I'm a little embarrassed 'bout it.. Been a while.. Never done a thing with such enthusiasm.. Maybe that's why.. When I was in the ring the other day, I thought.. 'No fear. This is great!' 'At least I'm the best in the ring..' '..whatever they say I'm the best.' Anyway, I really had a good time. Hmm? I said it was great. Here's the bus. Is this the last bus? Sure. Last bus. By the way, how heavy is Yubiho? About 80 to 90 kilos, why? Pops, I know you've been frustrated with my childish ways for a long time. Right. Just do better from now on. God! What in the world..? /I'll be the best from now on. Jerk! What the hell? You birdbrain! Grow up! Oh, I mean.. /When will you ever learn? Get out! You, you.. Who.. are you? Please, don't be alarmed.. It's me, Dae-Ho. What.. Dae-Ho? Why are you wearing that? I was startled. Forgive me. Didn't have the nerve without wearing this mask. Please forgive me. Do you know how late it is? I want to apologize for last night. Don't know what came over me.. I am really sorry. It's okay. You were a little wasted. Yeah, not sure what you'll think when I tell you.. ..what I want to say is.. Ms Jo, I love you. I've always been in love with you.. and I'll always love you.. forever.. Wait.. Wait a minute. What are you saying? What? Are you drunk? Requiem in the Ring Wait. Waiting Room Yubiho & No Ji-Shim Ah, Koyama-san. Oh-san, how are you? This is Yubiho. /Nice to meet you. Sorry. He's not here yet? Any calls? What's happened? Uh, oh. What should we do? What the hell is going on over here? Is there a wrestler or not? Did you even get a wrestler for the match? What happens when the crowd finds out? They'll feed us to the dogs! He's just arrived. Holy shit.. Who's he? Why the evil eye? What? Just this once, please! Yeah, just this one time. /Shut up! Think you can just bring me back after I die? Aren't you worried for me as a promoter.. or a human being? It's a tag match. You can do it, I know. Sure, if I can do it, why can't you? /You stay out of this. This is life and death! Keep on doing this and I'm outta here! I'm going to up and leave! Where are you going? /Let go! I don't have a lot to live for but you want me to get killed? If you really want someone, do it yourself! What? Do you want this to be our last? Yeah, right.. who cares? I give up, I don't care. I'm leaving. What? Where are you going? /Don't know. Be that way, you loser! You piece of shit.. you pig.. bastard! Hey, you still with them? Yeah, might as well stick with 'em. Yo, you're still taking lessons from Min-Young? Bring me my suit! I told them what to do. The Japanese are getting hot and heavy. In 10 minutes, we'll signal the announcer to give you a sign. Going to rip off his mask? We'll see. If I feel like it! When the announcer says, "10 minutes have elapsed".. ..Yubiho will do his 'Fire Bomb' twice. Get up on the first. Stay down on the second. That's it. Got it? Remember, down on the second Fire Bomb! Now for tonight's highlight, we present the main event for your viewing pleasure! First, the sultan of strength, No Ji-Shim! Next, enjoying immense popularity and just returning from Japan.. ..the very best in technical wrestling, Yu-bi-ho! Next, our challengers from the ranks of Jang's Gymnasium.. ..the human Kong, Killer Kong! ..and the horrible Foul King, Asura X! Hmm, looks like a wrestling match on TV. Second out! Look! It's Sharon Stone! Julia Roberts! Demi Moore! I give up! Hey, already? Hey, let go, release him. How come you're already switching with me? Don't know. Tripped. I fell down. The slipper! Slipper! /What? He's coming, he's coming! Give up? /One, two.. Give up? Give up? Give up? Give up? Touch.. touch.. /No touch.. no touch.. One two three.. One two three.. One two three.. Yubiho, Yubiho! One two.. [ Skipped item nr. 687 ] [ Skipped item nr. 688 ] One two.. Ten Minutes have elapsed.. Stop them! [ Skipped item nr. 692 ] You're awake? How do you feel? I'll go get you some porridge. Bye. /Let's not be too late going home /okay Good night, sir.
