You're the fairest in this hall, but snow white is the-- [ Chuckles ] Come on, rebecca. Forget it's a play. Just say it like you're saying it to me. Snow white's the fairest of them all. And again. Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the fairest of us all ? You're the fairest in-- wrong. You are. What are they doing, mommy ? Nothing, rebecca. Daddy's gonna be home soon. Last to the car's a bag of rats ! [ Dog barking ] [ Rebecca ] You never knew I was a bag of rats ! [ Rebecca ] Daddy ! Daddy ! [ Barking ] Hey. Hey, sweetie. [ Rebecca ] The goldfish died. Oh, no. He did ? He started to swim backwards. Mom put him in the freezer and said that we can bury him when you come back. Okay. You want something to eat ? Breakfast and lunch. Mary's made spaghetti, I think. Oh, god. It's 2:00 in the morning for me, honey. I'm sorry. What are these ? Nothing. That's snow white. Hey, why don't you show daddy your fairy costume, honey ? No, I don't want to. I wanna show him the goldfish. Okay. [ Chuckles ] What is this ? Little red riding hood ? No. it's nothing to do with anything. It's just another weird dream. Oh, no. not like the one you had before my mother died, is it ? No. Good. Not like that one. This one, it keeps coming back. There's an orchard and this little girl. That little girl, she's being led through it. The little girl that's missing ? She's holding someone's hand. It's a man or a woman... With red hair. I keep trying to get rid of it. I can't. I don't know. What do you want me to say ? If it's real, you should go to the cops. Come on, paul, please. I don't know what to do with this psychic stuff. I hate that word. So do I. What's "physic," Daddy ? They're searching the reservoir, but I have a feeling she's not dead. What's "physic," Daddy ? Psychic is when you can see through things, like, what's in that big, big, big box that daddy brought home ? [ Shouting ] Right by the front door. You got it ? You bet ya. I tramped all over tokyo for that. [ Motor whining ] [ Paul ] Not too low. And again. [ Chuckles ] [ Whispers ] Good night, sweetheart. Wasn't that meant for her birthday? Yeah, it was. But I can't be here. I'm only on a stopover. Have you told her ? No. They fucked up my schedule again. What about the play ? No, no. The play's fine. I have to leave for Seattle at 8:00. Hey. I got you a kimono. [ Growls ] [ Dog barking ] Hey. [ Girl ] What did you say your name was ? [ Deep voice ] Red. [ GIRL: Indistinct ] [ Sighing ] [ Girl ] Where are we going ? [ Gasps ] [ Sobbing ] What ? What is it ? I saw her, the little girl that's missing. I can't help it. I'm sorry. Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. She's so innocent, Paul, going wherever he asks her. It's somewhere terrible. I told you, if it's real, you should go to the cops. It's worse now. It's like some storm's about to break. All right, look, honey. Tomorrow I'll go to the police, okay ? I'll tell them whatever it is you're imagining you're seeing, all right ? I wanna know I'm wrong, Paul, more than anything. I wanna know it's just a dream. [ Paul sighs ] Oh, you know, I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Cooper. I apologize. Really I do. No problem. I hope you understand that, you know, this is, well-- I mean, this has been a very busy week. Yeah, yeah. Okay, uh, let me-- let me see if I get this right here. Your wife had a headache... And she saw a vision of the missing child, is that right ? No, no. I wouldn't phrase it like that. How would you phrase it ? She has, um-- she has these dreams. Dreams. Is she a clairvoyant ? No. Does she, you know, talk to dead people ? What ? Does she communicate with the dead ? No. Detective, this isn't something out of a seance. 'Cause I was gonna ask you, does she wear a turban ? [ Laughs ] One of those crystal balls with a lamp shade. None of that ? None of that. Just checking. All right, tell me what happened. She had a dream that the child was taken to an apple orchard... Where some terrible things were happenin' to her, somewhere north of here. Oh, yeah ? Yeah. In this vision of hers, did she get a fix on anyone else ? Only his hand. He was holding her hand. You mean, the little girl ? Yeah, but then she did say it could've been a woman's. Could have been-- oh. Yeah. All right. okay. Okay, sir. Thanks for comin' in. Detective, hang on a second ! I'm waitin' here an hour. I don't think my wife is makin' this up. I'm not saying she's makin' it up. It's been a long day, so give me a break. Based on your information, I'm lookin' for a man, I'm lookin' for a woman. It's not really helpin' me out. Listen. Listen, listen. I know you guys got a tough job alright, I got a tough job too. I fly 747s. Oh ? I got 350 people relyin' on me for their lives. So do me a favor, just hear me out. Don't treat me like I'm some kind of wacko. They already found her, Mr. Cooper. Bottom of a storm drain. Stones in her pockets. So you go back to flyin' your 747s. You take care of your people. I gotta get back to the tedious business of finding the fuck who killed her. Thanks for comin' in. [ Rebecca ] There are 12 fairies, Mommy. Oh. but you'll look the best. I'm the only one that talks. Okay. why don't you try it one more time ? Then we'll go to dance class, okay ? Big breath. Who's the fairest of us all ? You're the fairest in this hall, but snow white's the fairest of them all. Very good. [ Paul ] Claire ? Hon ? There you are. You don't have to tell me. I heard it on the news. Guess I'm crazy again, huh ? Well, you got it wrong this time. Yeah, I got a lot of things wrong. What's that supposed to mean ? You know exactly what it means. No, I don't. What are you talking about ? I'm talking about the girl that you're seeing in sydney, Australia. I'm talking about me pretending it hasn't been happening. Don't look so surprised, either. I'm not reading your mind. I'm not reading your fucking letters, either, but you should be more discreet where you put them ! It fell in Rebecca's lap. I took this girl out to dinner once. She got a crush on me. I fucked up. I'm sorry. Nothing happened. Honey, listen to me. Nothing happened. I promise you. I fucked up. So this is what's been fucking up the schedule ? No, this is not what's been fucking up the schedule. My schedule changes without notice, how many times do I have to tell you that? This isn't about your schedule. This is about you fucking someone. But I didn't fuck anyone ! I wanted to, but I didn't ! Maybe I wouldn't have wanted to... If the woman I love could at least be here once in a while ! I mean, where the hell are you, Claire ? If it's not one obsession, it's another. you're gone. Daddy, if I was real, Hmm? Dishing out wishes, All right. What would you wish ? That I didn't need one. Okay, let's go. My wand cured the rain. Oh, thank god for that. Let me take these off because they'll get bent in the car. okay ? Are you coming ? Yes, yes, I'm coming in the other car. Okay, let's go. Why ? Because I have to fly tonight, darlin'. When I come back, I'll stay much longer. If your mother lets me. Hello, flowers. Hello, birds. Hello, snow white ! [ Screams ] Please don't kill me. I'm begging you. Please. What have I done ? Please don't kill me. Please show mercy! ALL: Please show mercy! ALL: Please show mercy ! -ALL: Please show mercy ! - run ! Run into the forest and never come back, or your stepmother will get you ! [ Applause ] I'll always remember her beautiful smile. She was so very kind. She made our house a home. She was very nice to us. She so loved animals. [ Crying ] She cleaned my glasses. Honey ! Who is this lovely maiden ? Oops! ALL: She's snow white! What happened to her ? [ Dwarves ] She got poisoned by the witch. She is the most loveliest maiden I've ever seen. May I take her home to my castle so I can-- will we never see her again ? You may come and live in my castle as well. [ Applause ] Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the fairest one of all ? You are the fairest in this hall, but snow white is the fairest... Of them all. [ Giggles ] No, no, no ! Snow white's the fairest of them all ! [ Screaming ] [ Giggling, shouting ] Hello. There you are. You were so good. You were so good. Okay, hang on a second. I'll see you in a couple days, okay ? All right, bye-bye. Bye. all right, already. I gotta go. Look, Claire. I was stupid, all right ? I admit that. Nothing more. I promise. Okay. Promise ? It was my fault. Bye, bye. See you in a couple days. I love you. I gotta go. All right. I love you.

She's gone, you know that? We don't know that. Well, I know it ! Oh, Lord! Lord, let me help her. Let me help her! [SIGHING] [Deep VOICE: Slow, indistinct] [Police RADIO: Indistinct] So how long have you had these visions, Mrs. Cooper? All my life. All your life? Jeez. Look, you know, I-- I owe you an apology. I'm sorry. Your husband came to the station to talk to me. Don't apologize, detective. No. I was more wrong than you were. You see... I need an interpreter. For what?.

I'm the neurosurgeon. You've been trying to wake up for about a day now. You had us all running around. You had quite a little bump on your head. You had a lot of water in your lungs, but I think we're doing fine, Mr. Cooper. How long have I been here ? How long ? Well, about six weeks. Why did you bring me back ? Hmm. don't think it was easy, Claire. [ Muffled screaming ] [ Boy ] Mommy ! mommy, help ! - help ! help ! - [ Shattering sound ] Claire ? Claire ? Shh, shh, shh. You're in the hospital. You're in a hospital. Oh! Right. I'm Dr. Stevens. Remember me ? Remember meeting me ? Yeah. oof. You had a nightmare, hmm ? How did you know ? Well, your heart rate was bouncin' around Can you read dreams ? No. I skipped that class in college. Must've been a wild one, hmm ? Yeah. there's a little boy in a room and it's filling up with water. He's tied to the bed. Water, huh ? Water. I do have a friend who majored in-- what'd you call it-- reading dreams. Wanna talk to him ? Well, what is he ? He's a psychiatrist. But we won't hold that against him. Well, can he stop them ? He might. And I'll go get a nurse to prescribe something for you right now. All right ? Okay. Okay. [ Indistinct muttering ] [ Deep voice ] *Anyone Else But Me *Anyone Else But Me *Don't Sit Under *The Apple Tree *With Anyone Else But Me *Anyone Else But Me *Anyone Why are you singing that ? Because you were singing that... [ Chuckles ] In your sleep. How long have they been here ? They just got here. Claire. This is Dr. Silverman. He's the psychiatrist I told you about. Can you stop the dreams ? Well, we can start by talking about them. Has he killed another child ? Claire, you're here to get well, not drive yourself crazy, okay ? No. How many has he killed, paul ? How many ? There's a girl missing... Way upstate, but they're not sure it's the same guy. It is, and it's the same place. - Someone was singing. - You were singing. No. Someone was singing through me. That doesn't make sense. I don't make sense. Tell me about your dreams, Claire. [ Claire ] One's a little boy in a drowning room, and uh-- and some of the others are in this big room. It's like a... Orchard. It's filled with apples. [ Sighing ] I know there'll be more. Could you leave us together for a while ? - Will you make them go away ? - I'd like to try. Mr. Cooper, how is your marriage ? My marriage ? It's fine. I mean, it's as well as can be expected. But you've asked to take her home. Yes. she's my wife. I'd like to care for her at home, if it's possible. I just want to be assured that your home environment is stable. It is. Our marriage is fine. Well, in that case, I agree with you. I think home might be the best place for her. I'd like to be the judge of that, if that's okay. Of course, but we've got to realize that she's... In a state of suspended bereavement. She's lost a child. Never had a chance to mourn. [ Paul ] Well, I've had mary come for the week. Mary ? Yeah. mary. The housekeeper ? Your past life, Claire. How are we gonna deal with it, Paul ? Well, just day by day. I feel like it all happened to someone else. I wish to god it had. Like I'm some ghost, looking down on myself. What about her room ? I haven't been in there. I'm gonna get the bags. [ Sighs ] Claire ? [ Whispering ] Just go to sleep. [ Gasps ] [ Man ] I know you've been dreaming about me, Claire. And I've been dreaming of you. Oh ! ohh ! Jesus ! Fucking-- it wasn't me, Paul. It was a nightmare. Don't give me nightmare ! You were wide awake and kissing me. Aren't you taking medicine for those nightmares ? It doesn't work. Look-- I will do just about anything to get us through this, honey, but you better tell me what is going on in that head of yours. Please, I can't talk about it. You just bit through my fucking lip, and you can't talk about it ? okay, fine. You can't talk to me, you're gonna talk to someone else ! No ! No. Well, then you talk to me. Tell me ! He killed rebecca. And he knows. He knows what ? He knows I'm dreaming about him ! Oh, Claire. That is really crazy. I know. He's in my head. Who are you calling ? I'm calling your doctors ! They can't help me. Somebody has to. I can't. Listen. I've used up all my leave. I gotta go back to work. I've got to find a way to deal with it. I'll take the medication. I've got mary. Mary ? Mary's not a doctor. I swear to god, if I can't cope with it, I'll go back there myself. [ Man ] Claire, Claire, Claire, Claire. Huh. "Adapted and illustrated by Claire cooper." Claire, Claire, Claire. Once upon a time there was a little Claire. And a very little Claire she was. [ Man talking on radio, indistinct ] [ Gasps, laughs ] Hi. Hi.

Look, just so you know-- we checked every orchard within a radius of 300 miles. You found nothing ? No. That's the thing about these dreams of mine. They're no good till after it happens. Makes me seem crazy, doesn't it ? Oh, no. After what you've been through, you'd be forgiven a little psychosis. Kay. jack kay. Call me if you need anything. Anything at all, just give me a call, okay ? Thanks. Want me to walk you back to your house ? No, I'm okay. Thank you. [ Beeping ] Shit ! [ Sizzling ] Damn it. Mary !

[ Laughs ] And who cut your wrists ? [ Chuckling ] I did. [ Laughs ] But did that someone else make you do it ? No. that was all my own work. Why, Claire ? I wanted it to stop. What did you want to stop ? The laughter. the-- the thing. The dreams ? Can you dream in the daytime when you're wide awake ? When the sun's shining ? I'm sorry. I'm not that strong. I couldn't take it anymore. What does this verse mean ? I don't know. Is it from your childhood ? No, it's not from my childhood. [ Laughs ] It's from somebody else's childhood. Whose ? [ Softly ] I don't know. It's, uh-- it's written on the walls of a boy's room, and, uh, the boy is chained to the bed, and the room's filling up with water. So it's from a dream ? Yeah. And is this dream... Connected to your dream of apples ? Yes. It's the same boy. But in the orchard dream it was a man. - can't you make sense of it ? - would you like me to ? Oh, I would love you to ! I can't make sense of it. But, uh, I have a feeling that... They're all coming from the same place. From you ? No ! No ! from him. And who is he ? I don't know. But I think he deserves a name. We'll call him Red. It's appropriate. Okay, Claire. Let's leave it there for the moment. Okay. [ Sighs ] We're gonna take you down the hall. We're gonna get an EC.G.

I don't know who you are, and I don't know where I am, but I know that I'm being held here... Against my will, and you can't do that, and I want to use the telephone. I'd like you to sit on the bed. I just found my husband's dead body, and I want to use the phone ! You can use the phone after you've seen Dr. Silverman. What the hell is this place ? This is stapleton hospital. This is Rosco, and I'm nurse Floyd. I'm in charge of this wing. Well, fuck both of you. I want Silverman in here now. And I want to use the phone ! You're not listening.

[ Vivian ] Mr. Cooper ? [ Groggily ] Doctor, don't-don't let paul go to the hotel. Don't let him go. Is this a real hotel ? It doesn't matter. It's the carlton. It's by the ocean in hammond. When were you there ? Last night, room 401. So it's not real. You dreamed it. Was it day or night ? It's daytime. Please call him. [ Silverman ] Does he meet someone there ? He goes to find Dobie. Is Dobie a woman, Claire ? [ Groaning ] He's a fucking dog. Ooh. What have you given me, Doctor ? Why can't I think straight ? Thorazine. It calms you down. What happens to him there ? He dies. [ Sobbing ] Doctor-- don't you get it, Doctor ? 401. room 401. How many times do I have to say it ? So you dreamed that Paul died. I dreamed it and it happens. It's going to happen. Can't you get it through your thick psychiatric skull ? The man I love is dead and I'm left in this god-awful place alone. Hello ? You mean he's dead to you, Claire. No, no, I mean dead like rebecca. how many ways can I fucking say it ? Do-- - what the fuck ? - [ silverman ] It's called grief. No, no, it's Paul this time. Please. God, listen to me. [ Whimpering ] What's this ? - [ Yelps ] - [ Grunts ] listen to me ! - [ Barking ] - hi, paul ! - [ Groans ] - shit ! [ Alarm ringing ] [ Indistinct shouting ] Listen to me ! Oh ! no !

Just relax. Please, no. We're going to give you something. take it easy. Brought you some hot tea, honey. It'll still be warm. I'm sorry. Do I know you ? You're sharin' a room with me. They asked me to keep an eye on you. I don't remember. You got some people in your head. Hmm. [ Clatter ] What's the matter, honey ? You don't like the pattern ? [ Whispering ] Can you keep a secret ? [ Whispering ] Probably. You won't think I'm crazy ? [ Chuckling ] Probably ! I mean, look at you. That man in my head... Was in this hospital when he was a boy. How do you know ? He stayed in this room. He wrote that. His name's Vivian Thompson. Ooh, la, la. [ Chuckles ] Did anyone ever get out of here ? I wouldn't start thinkin' that. I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about somebody else. It's not that difficult. When you've been here as long as I have, you get to know the language of the place. Go to sleep. - [ girl ] Hi ! what's your name ? - [ woman ] Ruby ! Oh, sorry. I gotta go. Ruby ! Come on. I'm runnin' late. School time. Mommy's in a hurry now. You're not my mommy. [ Claire ] He's out there, hunting-- Looking for another little girl. Guess what her name is, doctor. Ruby. And what color is Ruby, Claire ? Ruby's not a color, Doctor. Ruby's a girl. Red... Why are you obsessed with that color, Claire ? I'm not obsessed, I'm possessed, Doctor. He's feeding me dreams bit by bit. Why's that, Claire ? Maybe he's lonely. Maybe he's lonely, Doctor. Have you a name for him yet ? Yes, I have. His name is Vivian. Vivian Thompson. There's a town out there covered in water. Someone left him in it. He was taken to this hospital. He stayed in my room and he's feeding me dreams. Why do you think that is, doctor ? Because he wants to stop. He wants me to stop him. It sounds psychotic to you, doesn't it ? I didn't use that word, Claire. you did. But follow it through, doctor, psychotic or not. I've gotta let him p ossess me-- surrender-- let him take me to him. So what does that make me ? Psychotic ? delusional ? Obsessional ? all three ? If you admit to yourself that it's delusional, Claire, we might be getting someplace. So, what's it say on the wall, ethel ? It's some kind of nursery rhyme. So, I'm not insane ? Not many of us are, honey. Go to sleep. That's a good idea. Sleep's the only way to reach him. he's out there somewhere hunting another little girl, and I've gotta stop him. [ Sighs ] whatever happens, though, promise me one THING: Don't wake me up. [ Panting ] [ Gasps ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming continues ] My apologies, Claire. Aah ! [ Grunting ] [ Rosco ] That's it, jodie. Let the medication do the job. You just relax and sleep. You'll be fine. Oh ! excuse me. [ Crickets chirping ] [ Engine starting ] [ Brakes squeal ] Hey. you need a lift ? I'm waitin' for Lucy. Everything all right ? No, I... Locked myself out of my car. You wanna come back to the office ? You can use the phone. Uh, I have a spare, uh, set... At a garage. If you're going out, you could drop me. Which garage ? The one down the road. Got your I.d. ? It's locked in the car. All right. Hop in. So, uh, do you want to get a drink or something like that ? Yeah, maybe. Whatever you wanna do. [ Siren wailing ] [ Police radio chatter, indistinct ] Could we have some music ? Music ? sure. [ Radio clicking ] *The You I've Come To Know * [ Continues, Indistinct ] You work nights. - Uh, yeah. - What's your name ? Vivienne. What's yours ? Walter. That's a nice name, vivienne. Hey, how you spell that ? V-i-v-i-e-n-n-e. Can't keep your eyes off me, can you ? Off what, Vivienne ? My legs. Pity to leave you so soon, Vivienne. Well... I'm in no real hurry. Well, what do you know ? Neither am I. You've been eating those knees the whole way. Shouldn't your eyes have been on the road ? I suppose they should've. You can kiss me if you want. Don't mind if I do. [ Giggling ] What the fuck ? [ Laughing ] Two things, Walter. ONE: get out of the car really slowly. Mm-hmm. TWO: you get your ass back to stapleton and tell Silverman... Mm-hmm. To check out the Carlton hotel. Why are we here ? That's my home. A lake ? You live in a lake ? Did once. [ Gunshot ] [ Splashing ] [ Whispering ] Where did you go, Vivian ? Please, please don't leave me now. [ Footsteps ] Wanna come over to my house, Claire ? Uh-huh. Yeah. I have to warn you, it's haunted. Who's it haunted by ? You. I'll show you how to get there. You can drive now. Vivian, is there a girl in your house called Ruby ? Ruby ? Yeah. She's dying to meet you. Oh, God. You thought it was a real orchard, huh ? That's the thing about DREAMS: They're always right... And always wrong. You have to drive inside. Okay ? I'll open the door. You know this place, don't you, Claire ? Yes. You know the funny thing ? What's the funny thing ? I know you got a gun tucked in the band of the nurse's dress you're wearing. I do ? You do ! And it's not very nice, you meetin' Ruby with a gun in your dress. Might get her upset. Might get me upset... And bring the apples down on all of us. Where is Ruby ? Ubi est Ruby ? I'm not tellin' till you gimme the gun. - you know what happens when the apples fall ? - I don't. *First The Tide [ Clatter ] *Rushes In *Plants A Kiss *On The Shore *Then Rolls I'm so, so... * [ Continues, Indistinct ] Sorry, sorry, sorry, Claire. All I wanted was a family. I knew there was a dreamer out there like me, 'cause I was dreamin' of her. I wanted her to be my family. And I took her little girl. And the little girl cried and hollered, and I punished her like any dad would. And she was lying... [ Sobbing ] Quiet, beautiful... But like a doll now. That's the part I'm sorry for. [ Gasping ] But I'm gonna make it up to you. I'm gonna work... Real hard. Make it perfect. I'm not gonna get upset anymore now that I've got you here, and I got us Ruby for a daughter now. Claire and Vivian and Ruby. [ Chuckles ] Did you-- did you get upset with Ruby, Vivian ? Not yet. not yet. Did you ? Are you gonna get upset with me ? Not if you love me like Mama loves Dad. Will you do that, Claire ? I'll do that, Vivian. I'll do that. You wouldn't just pretend. How could I pretend ? How could I pretend with you, Vivian ? You know me inside and out. Things are gonna be perfect... When I see Ruby. As perfect as they can be in this valley of tears. Oh, Lordy. What the fuck is this ? Her dream, Rosco. Your nightmare. [ Vivian ] Ruby, guess who's here ? Say hi to Ruby, Claire. Hello, Ruby. Are you a ghost ? - no, I'm not. - she was only a ghost when she wasn't here. Now that she's here she's just plain old Claire. Why don't you go down in the garden and show Ruby that you're not a ghost ? He said you were coming. You took a long time. I know. It was gettin' kinda lonesome here with just the two of us, huh ? I suppose. This is Marge. She was Vivian's doll before he gave her to me. Say hello to Claire, Marge. That nice lady is not a ghost. Hello, Claire ! Welcome home ! Welcome home, Claire. She's followed him. [ Rosco ] Who ? Vivian Thompson. He escaped through that grate. Murdered a nurse. - when ? - twenty-five years ago. October 1972. I'm lost, Doctor. Join the club. He killed her daughter. He shares her dreams. He snatched another little girl called Ruby. She's gone to stop him. Call the police. Show them this. Tell them wherever he is, she is. Where are you going ? A place called Hammond, the Carlton Hotel. I'll make us somethin' to eat. Is anyone hungry ? How 'bout "pasghetti" ? Daddies can be just like mommies, you know that ? Can they, honey ? That's what Vivian said. They can cook too. What else did he tell you, Ruby ? Told me my real mom is up in heaven waiting for me. That's Vivian's mom there. [ Claire ] That's a tailor's dummy, Ruby. I know, but that's the kind of clothes she used to wear. Why does he keep them here ? For when he's playing mom. He's very good at it. You know, you should hear the way his voice changes. Why does he do that ? Says his daddy was a dollar and his mommy was a song. A song ? "Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me." So that's his mother's song. That's what she was, that song. [ Grunting ] I don't like the cold. Ruby. Ruby, listen to me, okay ? Vivian's sick, honey, and he needs help. There's a possibility that he could hurt you. You're scaring me. I'm gonna take you away from here so he can't hurt you. [ Screaming ] Vivian ! Shh ! quiet ! I've been looking for the can opener, but I can't... Find it ! Aah ! Know it's down there. She okay or is she sick ? Sometimes mommy and daddy fight and that's bad. Sometimes mommy and daddy fight and that's good. She's so, so, so tired. You help me find it ? 'Cause you're the girl. And when we find it you can have some... Snacks. And she can sleep, and then when she wakes up we'll feed her too. You gonna say you're sorry now ? *Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree With anyone else but me * *Anyone Else But Me Cat got your tongue ? *Anyone Else But Me You're worse than your goddamn daddy ! *Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree With anyone else but me * *Till I Come Marching home * * [ Continues, Indistinct ] [ Whimpering ] [ Ruby ] You got him real mad. That's why he put you in bad mommy's clothes. He says he's disappointed in you. He told me you'd be the loveliest mommy in the whole wide world. Does your face hurt ? I can kiss it better. Is that better ? Are you tied too tight ? I'd loosen it, but he might get mad again. I'd never seen him mad before. [ Vivian ] Ruby ! [ Sirens wailing ] Dr. Silverman ? Yeah. You know this place ? I was told about it. Okay. let's get some light in there. - [ Barking ] - [ Kay ] sweet Jesus. [ Vivian ] *...The-- With anyone else but me * *With Anyone Else But Me *With Anyone Else But me * Bedtime, Ruby. Undo me, okay ? Time to move over, Claire. Thank you, sweetums. Go snuggle up with mommy. I'd never hurt you, Claire. [ Chuckles ] Didn't mind hurting Paul, though, did I ? I thought you'd be a better mommy. My mom was no good either. She... Wore dresses like that. *Never Knew My Dad *Mom Was All I Had No-o-o ! Please ? Got eyes in the back of my head. When mom said it was time for bed, I-- I believed her. Sorry if I'm moody. It's just been a long day. Things didn't turn out the way... I thought they would. Now I'm gonna kiss you... Good night. Aah ! Ow. Take a cheek, Ruby. [ Gasping ] Oh, God. Shh. Claire ? Shh, shh, shh, shh. Yes ? Claire ? Yes ? I just had a bad dream. I dreamed my mommy was dead in the lake... And she had your face. [ Gasps ] [ Sobbing ] Does that mean you're gonna kill me ? I hope not. Any word on the car she took ? I got a report it was seen heading west on route 9. Great. let's go. All right. [ Man on radio, indistinct ] You're not such a bad mom. Don't get him mad again. - yaah ! - [ Screams ] - [ gun cocks ] - I don't like you anymore. - I don't die here. I die in the lake, remember ? - I forgot about that. - maybe you develop a limp. - I emptied it. [ Crying ] Run, Ruby ! Run, Ruby ! Run ! wait ! stop. Come here. now, you gotta be brave now, Ruby. You gotta be brave, honey. Yes. you gotta come with me. - I can't. It's me he wants, not you. - Claire ! [ Muttering ] Vivian. Mo-o-om ? You gonna say you're sorry now ? I don't wanna ! [ Grunts ] [ Sirens wailing ] Westbound, route 9. Just made visual contact with ground units. over. [ Vivian ] Mo-o-om ! Something's wrong. Mom ? Uhh ! [ Whispers ] The cat got my tongue. Mom ? it hurts real bad. [ Gasps ] Ruby, where the fuck are you ? [ Blade scratching ] [ Vivian ] Claire ! - it still hurts ! - aah ! Gonna kiss and make it better ! [ Yelping ] [ Growls ] Every couple has their problems. Thing is, we have to talk ! [ Grunts ] [ Brakes squeal ] Two-six to dispatch. I have a young girl fitting the description of the subject. Ah ! don't you want to work it out ? or is it just too late for me and you ? 'Cause I know how it goes NOW: Ruby makes it to the road. She stops a car, maybe a police car, and the policeman comes into my house and there's all this hostage stuff ! Is that how it goes ? Uh-huh. Maybe Claire falls. Oh, maybe Claire breaks her neck ! [ Screaming ] [ Sarcastically ] oh, I don't want this to happen ! And I really went out of my way to bring you here ! - maybe Claire jumps ! - Oh, no, please ! Aah ! - aah ! - Claire ! Clai-aire ! Uuh ! [ Sirens continue ] We got a lead. A girl found off the interstate named Ruby. Head due east. We're looking for a large wooden structure in the middle of the woods-- a cider factory. [ Pilot ] Roger that. Claire ! Claire ! Where are you ? [ Vivian screaming ] Air nine, this is air seven. Have established visual contact of the suspect. Hey ! hey ! hey ! He's back there ! He's back there ! [ Screaming ] Now there's all this hostage stuff. I told you so ! You've gotta give yourself up ! But how ? I let you go, they'll make a real mess of me. The gun's empty ! There's no fucking bullets ! Go away ! go away ! - oof ! - shoot ! Aah ! [ Bullet clanks metal ] * [ Woman Vocalizing ] Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all ? You are. Wrong. You are. Come with me. Where, darling ? Home. [ Man ] The jury has found you guilty, but insane. So to my great regret, I cannot pass the death sentence. Therefore, I command that you be held in a secure mental facility... Until the state of Massachusetts deems it safe for you to walk our streets again, which I hope will not be in my lifetime. I can live with that. [ Gasps ] [ Coughs ] I can live with this too. [ Groaning ] [ Gasps ] Shh, shh. Pleasant dreams. [ Screaming ] [ Relieved sigh ] Yaah ! aah ! [ Whimpering ] Oh ! [ Screaming ] Help ! *I Close My Eyes *Then I Drift Away *Into The Magic Night *I Softly Say *A Silent Prayer *Like Dreamers Do *Then I Fall Asleep To Dream *My Dreams Of You *In Dreams *I Walk *With You *In Dreams *I Talk *To You *In Dreams You're Mine *All Of The Time *We're Together *In Dreams *In Dreams *But Just Before *The Dawn *I Awake *And Find You Gone *I Can't Help It *I Can't Help It *If I Cry *I Remember That You Said *Good-bye *It's Too Bad *That All These Things *Can Only Happen *In My Dreams *Only *In Dreams *In Beautiful *Dreams
