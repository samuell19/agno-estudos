Don’t let anyone tell us that when we’re no longer kids, we grow up. When we grow up, we won’t quit being kids. Where are the real we? Should the real we be here? We’ve only got a little more time to be the real us… 2004, Shiba High Holly Festival. Okay, cut! Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. Hmm… How was that? Well… Should we shoot another version? Huh? The last part? Yeah. Tomoyasu, I have to go now. No, wait a sec. Which part? That Shiba High Holly Festival part. Cut closer and… Bam! Make an impact. Hmm? Oh, really? Well, then… let’s see… But we could use that one. Oh, yeah? Okay, then. Okay, that was fine. Are you sure? I could do it again if you want. Oh, you can? She says she’ll do it. Should we do a close-up? Well, I don’t know… What should I do? Then could you say the last line once again? Okay. Yeah, thanks. Could you… Could you do it like you did the last time? Okay? Are you ready? Yeah, ready. Ready? Let’s make an impact… Okay, let’s do it. It’s a take! Ready, start! 2004, Shiba High Holly Festival. Cut! Nozomi. Is Kei here? Probably in the clubroom. Been there all morning. She won’t listen to anybody. Come with me. Not now. I’ll meet you later. Kyoko. Where’s Kei? Nozomi says she’s in the clubroom. How is it? I’m taking painkillers, so… Come to the clubroom with me. No, I’ll pass. You shouldn’t worry about it. Those two are… They’re too… Sort of short-tempered, you know? I’ll go see what’s going on. No, that side should be higher. Now this side’s too low. Just raise it higher. The whole thing? This side, higher. Hello, sir. Rinko. “The Japan - Korea Culture Exchange Exhibit” “Beef Darts” I’ll print out the missing ones by tomorrow. Oh. Maybe I should make flyers to copy and pass out. Flyers? It’s okay. I’ll do it. Are you tense? No. You really should enjoy yourself. I’ll be in the classroom, so come if you need anything. Yes. So why is Moe Imamura’s injury the reason for their argument? I told you, I don’t know. Did you ask them? I did. But no. They won’t say? They won’t say. Kei Tachibana and Rinko Marumotoare alike. Is Moe all right? Her injury. I hear she jammed her finger playing basketball in P.E. And her middle finger, I think, she either broke it or it cracked. So I was asked to stand in. - What for? - The band, the band. Rinko asked me to play the guitar. But then she said to forget it. I asked her why, but she wouldn’t say. Do the others know anything? They won’t say. They’re probably hiding something. Isn’t it your job as leader to smooth things out? Well, why don’t you just call them over and ask them yourself? Right? Hello. Have you seen Kei? She was here until now. She just left. Is it true that Kei and Rinko are at it again? Who told you? Everyone knows. Don’t go telling everybody. They should be left alone. I know that. It’s just their usual thing, right? Well, yeah. You know everything already? Who started it? Who do you think? I dunno… Rinko, maybe? What she did to Moe… Asking someone to stand in right after she got hurt. But why is Kei angry about… Well, no… I guess I thought so, too. Kei hates Rinko, right? That’s not true. I didn’t say that. Well, whatever. So what’s gonna happen? Is the band still on? Hey, Kyoko. Is Kei here? No. Kei! See, I told you she’d be here. Kei, didn’t you hear? The teacher wants you. Why? He wants to talk to you. And Abe’s asking if the band’s still on. Yeah, is it? If you’re quitting, I have to reschedule. Make up your mind. So? You’re not gonna do it? That’s final? We’ll do it. We’ll do it! I’ll play the guitar. Let’s do it. You read comics a lot faster now, Son. Yeah. I chose these comic books. When they’re good, you read faster. So I get credit, right? Yeah. In that story, Yuuki kisses, and is stabbed. Don’t tell me! It’s okay, you’ll still like it. How about Ringo Shiina? Not in 3 days. I can’t. Puffy? Are you serious? Will you sing? Sorry. Aaaargh! What should we do? What are you doing? What’s that? It was in the locker. Princess Princess… The Boom… Boowy… Jun Sky Walkers… I don’t know any of these bands. They’re all old. Oh, here’s Unicorn. - Tamio’s band? - Tamio’s band. Why do you know these? Oh! Jitterin’ Jin! “You gave me an earring of An upside down giraffe” The giraffe’s what? Upside down… - Once more! The giraffe is… - ...upside down… Let’s hear it! Where is it? - Here… - Gimme. It’s not that funny. This isn’t it. No… “I want to be beautiful” “Because there’s a beauty” “That can’t be photographed” “Linda Linda! Linda Linda Linda!” “Linda Linda! Linda Linda Linda!” “If I ever meet you” “And we talk together” “I hope you realize” “The meaning of love” Hey, hey, hey, hey! Okay. The first person that passes by over there is the singer. Where? What are you saying? Then will you sing? No way. You do it, Kei. I can’t do both. You can do it. No, I really can’t. How about Moe? Moe? Her voice isn’t The Blue Hearts. It might work, though. I want it to be a girl. What’s going on? Hmm? Uh… We’re canceling, right? I’ll tell Abe. We already told him. Oh, you did? That we’re doing it. We’re going to do The Blue Hearts. Just you three? We’re looking for vocals. Can you sing for us, Rinko? Come on. Then let’s do the other one again. We could rearrange it without Moe… It’s The Blue Hearts or nothing. The other one has to be with Moe. We’ll just find another singer. Fine. You don’t want to, do you? It’s not that I don’t want to, but… What’s the point in doing it? There is no point. Hey, Son! Son, let’s do a band. Yes! You can sing, right? Yes! We’re doing The Blue Hearts. Uh, yes! That’s okay, right? That’s okay! Good luck, then. Thanks. What? No! No, no! I can’t! Why not? She can learn Japanese. No, I mean will she be able to learn it all now? That goes for us, too. Well, I suppose… We should first ask Son if she wants to do it. You’re absolutely right. But… Son answered so carelessly over there. We dragged her into this. You’re too irresponsible. I said I’m sorry. So, if Son says she doesn’t want to sing, then… Oh, well, I’ll do it. Oh? Hmm… “Linda Linda. Linda Linda Linda” Son, how about it? Can you do it? What’s wrong? - Are you all right? - What’s wrong? Hey? Are you okay? What? You’re crying, Son. Thank you. Here. Thanks. Did you always take this bus? Hmm? Do you take this bus to school? Yes. Maybe we’ve met. I’ve seen you? No. I’ve seen you. Oh, me? You saw me? Oh… I never noticed. Since when? I don’t really play the guitar. Oh. Keyboards. I used to take piano lessons. So I can’t really play the guitar… Oh… Can I… Do my best? Sure. Do your best. Yes. We work like this. You can drink all you want for 560 yen. You’re a student, so you can choose from these soft drinks. Oh. I just want to sing. You can’t just sing. To use the facilities, you have to order a drink. I just want to sing. You just want to sing… Well, you could just order a single drink instead. It’d be cheaper. Uh, coke, ginger ale, melon soda, orange juice… I said I just want to sing. Yes, well, I understand, but… Is this your first time coming to a place like this? Look, if you don’t drink, you can’t sing. That’s weird. No, it’s not. I don’t want anything. If you don’t drink, you can’t sing. I don’t want a drink. Then you can’t sing. Oh, sorry. I’m hot, I’m hot, I’m hot. Shut up. “Do you know where my right hand is?” “Do you know where my right hand is?” Uh, “missing…” “I’ll play my guitar…” Kyoko! Kyoko! What? Phone call! Who is it? A guy named Kazuya Oe. What? A guy named Kazuya! Hey! What did you say to him? Nothing. Hello? Hello? - It’s Kazuya. - Hi, Kazuya. Uh, you know that… Um… Yeah? The bananas were too small. Yeah. Oh, the bananas? One would be enough for four people. Oh. Enough for four? Oh, okay. Yeah, I’ll get some ready and bring them. Oh, and do you know about the hotplates? Yeah, we have one. You do? Will you bring it tomorrow? Sure, okay. Okay. Tomorrow then. Yeah. Hello? Yes. See you tomorrow. Yeah. I’ll bring it tomorrow. “It’s gone missing” “I’ll pass out wanted posters” “All over the city” It wasn’t your fault, Moe. That was… You know, a problem between Rinko and me. A fight. So don’t apologize. Rinko said the same thing. But it is my fault since all the practice we’d done… You know, until now… was wasted because of my finger. Sorry. Yeah. Invite her in. Okay. Good evening. You’re going to Kyoko’s? Yeah. You don’t have to, you know. Thanks for the guitar. Yeah, use it. It’s much better than the other one. Yeah. I’m playing guitar… “I can’t give an explanation for them” “Today and tomorrow and the day after” “I’ll be searching for something” “I’ll grasp the microphone” “Like you’ve never seen before” “I’ll sing in a way” “You’ve never heard before” “So” “Do you know where my right hand is?” Kei, Kei, Kei… Terrible. Okay, this is a popcorn stand. Hi, there! Thank you! Hello! This stall sells fried noodles. How about some? Give him some more! They’re doing good business. Hello! I’m at the horror house at 3-2. Uh… I’ll check it out. Next! Next! I can’t do this! Aaugh! Finished delivering to class 5! Good job. I’m exhausted… Why am I doing this? It was your idea. I regret it. Why do people want crepes delivered? Kazuya, stand in for me later. I have to do the Ultra Quiz. Yeah. Chocolate banana. Aren’t you full? One chocolate banana. Sure. One chocolate banana. Coming right up! Kyoko. Kyoko. What? Look at Kazuya’s ear. Here, look. Aren’t his earlobes amazing? Look, he’s all hairy. Stop it. - Don’t be shy. - I’m not. Here. Thank you. Oh, there’s another hotplate. Whose is it? It’s mine. I brought it. But I didn’t ask you to. Did you call her? No. Of course you wouldn’t. Sachi called you? Yeah. Arai, take this to the audiovisual room. Hey, the delivery boy’s too busy. Come with me. Don’t be lazy. Sorry I’m late. Where’re the others? Nozomi’s… Where’s Kyoko? Not here yet. We’re ready. Wanna start? Here. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, banana, right? Sorry, can I go now? When can you come back? I can’t promise anything… Come back by 4. I can’t let Kazuya do all the work. - Sorry. - Don’t worry about it. I’ll try to come back… Yeah. Sorry. You’re late. What do we do? I’m really sorry. Kei’s always like that. Yeah… Hello. Yo, Kei. What? Yeah, I’m fine. What’s up? A new boyfriend? I’m kidding. Now? I’m recuperating. I’m not doing anything. Yeah. Yeah. Studio Q? It’s probably open. Hello! Hello! Hello. Oh, Kei. Didn’t recognize you. You look totally different in uniform. Long time no see. Hi. Is Mr. Maezono here? Yeah. You said you were going to Tokyo. Yeah, next month. Oh. Are you taking your car? Nah, I’m leaving it. My brother uses it. Oh, I see. And I’ll be back once a week. Oh. Yeah. Come over sometimes. Yeah. So, what are you doing? The Blue Hearts. Seriously? Yeah. Far out. Yeah. Which song? “Linda Linda” and… Yeah. “My Right Hand” and “An Endless Song”. Whoa, great, man. Cool. Son. Son. You’re staring. - Hello. - Hi. Vocals? You a senior? You in Kei’s class? In the pop music club, right? You’re not? I’m from Korea. What? An exchange student? Wow… Far out… You’re Kei’s... ex-boyfriend? Huh? Yeah. You’re funny. I like you. What’s up? Is something wrong? Kei, it’s this. See? You all right? - It’s twisted. - I’m okay. Raise your arms. I’m okay. It’s too high. I’m fine. We’re gonna practice so get out. You’re all red. Shut up. Can’t I listen? We’re gonna practice, so go. - Don’t break anything. - Hurry. I’ll go wash my car. What? Let’s practice. I can see your underwear. Shh! “Because there’s a beauty” “That can’t be photographed” This isn’t working. Come on, Son. Terrible. Son. Come on. Sorry. Shh! Shh! It was Masami… She and Moe were friends from before. So Moe joined. Yeah, but Masami quit, so Moe asked me to join. Around then, I was asked by Kei and joined. That was in our junior year, right? Yeah. No changes until you joined yesterday. Yeah. Did you really get that? ＜No… No.＞ Kei and Rinko were the only original members. Of course. They started it in the first place. Oh, yeah. That’s true. Why did it end up like that? It’s hatred between those who are close. That’s pretty heavy. My parents are like that. They’re cold! Thanks! Here you go, girls. I want that one. Hey, we were saying, what’s our band gonna be called? - The name? - We can’t use the other one. Let’s just focus on playing it right. But it’s important. My motivation… Like when you name a stray dog, it grows on you. She likes to start from the appearance. What? Why not? I didn’t say it was bad. Yeah, I like to. So what? Fine. Fine. - What? - We didn’t say anything! What? Seriously, though, we won’t forget about times like this. I mean, what Kyoko said about it being important. I can understand what she means. And… We’ll probably be too busy during the actual gig to remember anything. Hey! See, Nozomi’s angry! It’s not my fault! Nozomi’s no fun! Don’t laugh. That’s rude. Son! That was rude. Don’t be angry. “Like a rat” “I want to be beautiful” “Because there’s a beauty” “That can’t be photographed” “Linda Linda! Linda Linda Linda!” “Linda Linda! Linda Linda Linda!” “If I ever meet you” “And we talk together” “I hope you realize” “The meaning of love” “Linda Linda! Linda Linda Linda!” “Linda Linda! Linda Linda Linda!” “Blue Heart” “Paran Maum” “The Japan - Korea Culture Exchange Exhibit.” Takako. - Hey, Kei. - Hi. Take a seat. - Want some juice? - Yeah. Which one? This one. Okay. Here. Thanks. What are you doing? A mange café. You’re my first customer. Let me see your guitar. You’re not playing this year. Nope. Everyone else graduated. I thought you’d play on your own. No way. It’s no fun if you don’t do it with others. Do you still go to Tomoki’s gigs? Oh, you guys broke up? He’s moving to Tokyo next month. Yeah. He is. With Rinko and them? Tomorrow. Oh. We were going to, but Moe got hurt and things happened… You’re not playing? No, we’re playing, but not original songs. - Copies? - Yeah. So what? If you get up there, anything is fun. What’re you doing? The Blue Hearts. Ooh, cool! “Linda Linda…” Yeah, yeah. Great. Tomoki used to play the Ramones and stuff before… Uh, right. The Blue Hearts, eh? Hi. Nozomi, let’s go. Wake up. She’ll never wake up. What should I do? Hit her over the head. Nozomi, let’s go. It’s not working. Maybe if you pinch her nose. Good morning. Let’s go. Let’s go. Here. Son, let’s go. Son, come on. What’s this? Son. What? It was on the desk. It’s in Korean. What does it say? “Please come to the equipment room at two.” What time is it now? 10 more minutes. Are you going? No. You should go. - I’m not going. - Just go. Hey, that’s Macky! Hey? Hey, this way. Get over here! Hi. What’s going on? What, you mean Yusaku? What’s he want with Son? I’m not sure, but he says he sees her often and is in love. What, love at first sight? I dunno. ＜Hello.＞ Yes, hello. ＜We always meet at the incinerator.＞ Huh? Where? ＜The incinerator. The incinerator.＞ Oh! “Incinerator.” ＜We always meet at the incinerator.＞ I don’t remember. ＜I always go＞ ＜to the incinerator to see you.＞ Yeah. ＜I come to school＞ ＜to see you.＞ Yeah. ＜I love you.＞ What? What did you say? ＜I love you.＞ Oh. Yes. Um… I have to practice singing. ＜I love you, Son.＞ Can I go now? Uh… I said I love you. I don’t dislike you, but I don’t like you, either. ＜I want to be with them. My friends.＞ What? You said okay? Hey, wait! Wait, Son! Son! Son! This is tomorrow’s schedule… The timetable? It’s all there. Oh, um… Here. Oh, this. But things are still flexible. I’m hoping to play things by ear. Okay. Um… The juniors will set things up tomorrow morning. Fine. Well, so that’s that, then. Hey, Rinko. Yes? Um… Kei and Kyoko and them… Are they in another band? So I hear. Oh. Then could you tell them that… they don’t have to sneak around to practice? I mean… For better or for worse… School festivals… in my time were… You know… - Can I go now? - Sure. Oh, hey! Uh… Tell them what I just said, okay? Garlic. Son, I don’t need three. Just one. - I didn’t see it. - It’s there. So I’ll give one to Son, and I’ll eat one. Then can I buy two, too? Why are you eating two? Then buy one for Nozomi. That’s not fair. Why not? Oh, I know. We’ll buy this. There are four kinds. I said I want pudding. - Here. - Here. What’re these? Dessert. I’ve only got 1000 yen. Put them back. What about dessert? Mom’s made some jelly. Jelly? Put them back. Okay. Nozomi! Which one? This one. This is Nozomi’s junior high. That’s Kobayashi! Look at his hair! It just looks messed up. Oh! Is this Mizuho? No, though it looks like her. Look at that. Look, it’s Kazuya Oe. It’s him. Wow, he used to have longer hair… You like him, Kyoko? Hmm? Yeah. ＜Really? These things are first come, first serve.＞ Oh, that’s Kazuya Oe. You were in the same class. Just in my last year. ＜If you don’t tell him soon, you’ll miss out.＞ You’re talking gibberish. Um… You should tell him how you feel. He’s free right now. I know… Even Macky tried. Hello? Um, this is Kyoko. Sorry I couldn’t help out much today. And, um… Kazuya, are you free tomorrow? The gig? Yeah, we’re doing the gig, but… Could I see you before the gig? Um… Just a minute. What time is the gig tomorrow? 3:30. 3:30! Hello? The gig’s from 3:30. So at 2:30 in the equipment room, okay? Yeah. Well… See you tomorrow. Bye. Did you ask him? I did. Stop by and play a game! Hi, there! Have some great sausages! Would you like a massage? Feels great! Here’s some Oden. Really good Oden! Sweet crepes for sale! Great fried noodles! How about some? ＜Um… ＞ ＜Thank you so much for coming to see us today.＞ ＜Today’s the last day of our tour,＞ ＜so we’re really fired up.＞ ＜Okay, so now＞ ＜I’ll introduce the sleepy band. We’ve been up every night practicing!＞ ＜On drums!＞ ＜She misses practice. But she’s cute!＞ ＜Kyoko!＞ ＜On bass!＞ ＜Her cooking’s a bit salty and she’s shy. But she’s cute!＞ ＜Nozomi!＞ ＜On guitar!＞ ＜She’s short-tempered and is scary when she’s mad, but she’s really sweet.＞ ＜The one who recruited me!＞ ＜Kei!＞ ＜And on vocals…＞ ＜Son!＞ ＜Okay, let’s go!＞ “Like a rat” “I want to be beautiful” Son, let’s start. “So… Do you know where my right hand is?” “People are all weak” “But dreams will always come true” “Almost asleep deep in your eyes is” “An undaunted heart” “These tears about to overflow” “I can’t give an explanation for them” “Today and tomorrow and the day after” “I’ll be searching for something” “I’ll grasp the microphone” “Like you’ve never seen before” “I’ll sing in a way” “You’ve never heard before, so” “Do you know where my right hand is?” Cool! Cool! No, really, the guitar was great. Yeah! Yeah. All right! We won’t end here. It’s not wrong to expect a miracle. We won’t let our high school days become a memory. Is this wind the same as the one blowing the day after tomorrow? Will and courage will be kept in the same pocket. This is our kingdom. 2004, Shiba High Holly Festival. The final day. Cut! We’ll do the drums. The freshmen can do the rest. Oh, okay. It’s hot. Morning. Morning. Morning. What? It’s morning. Oh. We’ll be in and out carrying the equipment. It’s gonna be a busy day. Good luck. Yeah. Okay, those cymbals. That one’s for kids. That one’s for adults. Wow! Ribs! Great! Son, morning! Morning! Hey, you have a friend. Who is she? Uh… Hello! Thanks. No, no! Over here. Ribs! Here goes! Wait, wait! Not yet! We’re not finished. Sorry. It’s all right. It’s all right. Here goes, then. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry. It’s okay. You can make mistakes. But don’t stop. Let’s try to play until the end. Yeah. And Kyoko, aren’t you a bit slow? Yeah? Yeah. Play your part. Yes, yes, yes. That was good. Got it. Okay, Kei… Kei. Kei. Oh… Sorry. Damn. I’ll go wash my face. ＜Kei.＞ Hmm? ＜Thanks for letting me in the band.＞ What, all of a sudden? ＜I just felt like saying it.＞ Yeah. Thanks for joining us, Son. ＜We’re both thanking.＞ The gig’s today! Let’s do our best. ＜Yeah.＞ What’s going on? Kei, Congratulations! Congratulations! Kei, Congratulations! Mom! You didn’t… Congratulations, Kei. Kei, here. You said your hands were too small, so… Try it on. Kei, Congratulations! Thanks. Thanks. “Oh, our” “Long journey” “Is coming to an end” Thanks. Now we’ll do our last song… That’s the last song. Shouldn’t we call the next act? Next up is… Kei’s band. Hey, someone go find Kei’s band. Makoto, go. Okay. Moe, have you seen Kei and them? What? Did The Denki Bran finish? No, but almost. But I can’t find Kei. Hold on. Thank you. Hello. Is this alcohol? No, I don’t think I should… The Budokan’s pretty small on stage… It’s different when it’s full. Some people are here today just for you, Kei. Who? The Ramones and Mr. Pierre Taki. Hello? Huh? Kyoko? Hmm? What? What do you mean, “What?” I’ve been waiting forever. What’s going on? Aaugh! Hello? Kyoko? Hello! What should we do? Huh? Oh, Moe’ll fill in for now. Good luck. Uh… Well, um… I’ll sing something. Oh, no. Great. I can’t believe this! Hurry, hurry! I’m Takako. Here goes. Hello? You haven’t seen them? Well, you’re right, but… Oh! - Kazuya called! - Really? I’m sorry, I forgot to tell you. Oh! What? No, it’s nothing. What? Tell us. I forgot my bass at the studio, but I’ll borrow one at school. Are you crazy? Go get it! - It’s okay... - Go on! Kei’s not here yet, so one more song, please! Just until they arrive. Another song? Oh! Son! Oh… Are you all right? You all right? You can put it down. I’m all right! Kyoko! Kazuya. Um… I’m sorry I’m late… Yeah… What happened? We’ll go on ahead. Son! Right! “Wandering, here and there, Wanderer, Wanderer” “Even with the passing years, Wanderer” You’re late. Sorry. Where were you? What are you gonna do? Bring a towel. Where’s Kyoko? She’s coming. Can they go? No, there’s no more time. We can’t play? Well, maybe not even 10 minutes. Okay. No problem. Let’s go. You don’t have time. I heard. It’s your fault, you know. I know. You all right? Well… Not really. Good luck. Thanks. You finally made it! I’m really sorry. Sorry. Good luck. Kei, you’re on. Yes. How’d it go? I couldn’t tell him.
