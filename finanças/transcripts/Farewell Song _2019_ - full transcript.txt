Shima. Remind that dumb bitch of the no eating rule. The rule's "no smoking." Let me get this straight. You two really want to end this? Yes Haru? Then promise me. We'll break up, but we'll finish this tour. Promise and sign this. Screw that. We keep our promises. Leo? - Fine. - That's good Haruleo plays seven cities, then breaks up in Hakodate. Once you sing your last song, we'll be strangers. - You won't stop her? - What's the point? She'll be back for the gig. If she isn't, Haruleo ends there. July 14th, 2018 Lake Side Story, Hamamatsu "21:15 Haruleo" - Haru! - Leo! Get out here! Come on, dammit! We're all waiting! - Well? - Five more minutes. She keeps her promises. If she doesn't, you two better cover for her. This is your fault. It damn well isn't. Gimme a break. Leo! Leo! Leo! I know what day it is. What's this? I tried to go but he kept stopping me, then when I got mad... Why do you always fall for guys like that? Cover it up in five. - Hi, I'm Haru. - I'm Leo. We're Haruleo. It's been a while since we played this club in Hamamatsu, so I'm really excited. - Leo, marry me! - I love you Leo! This might sound corny, but for Haruleo, this is the first place we played on our first tour ever, so... How can I put it... Anyway, this place is special for us, so we'll sing this song first. I'm going away to get to know loneliness I don't need a companion for now On the side of a road that wasn't really a road A cat with feeble eyes meowed at me Saying please, give me something to dream about I can't be sure The way forward isn't clear Although we've barely spoken at all Come along with me Somewhere down the line A storm is bound to come but we'll be alright That band before us has a major label offer already. They only formed three months ago. Today's your birthday, Haru? No. The day I first spoke to Leo. When are you gonna learn? Didn't your parents teach you how to fold? Useless. Redo it. Redo all of it. No break for you. Get to work. Wanna play music? With me. Sorry, forget it. This is G. This is C. And...C. G again. C. C. Try G. G... Give me a hand. Wash those tomatoes. Don't you cook? Silly. Looks good. Good? Bless this food. You're weird, Leo. My temperature was rising And I think you could tell So instead of opening my eyes I hesitated Two seconds later we realized this was the end Then we unnaturally... Then we unnaturally faked a smile I'm fine with this thorn staying stuck inside me I like it. Keep going. I'm still working on it. Why? Why'd you ask me? Your eyes wanted to sing. Get outta here. I mean it. I felt it the first time I saw you. Then I'll sing. I'll try hard to follow you. We give water to our hearts even though they'll stop one day We make them beat fast and make them run away We rage, we hurt, we cry Then rage, laugh, and love again Trying to boil water that never seems to burst out In the fissures within our lives We collect trickling drops of hope Everybody has a story - Dubai? - Yeah, Dubai. A city like a desert mirage. I flew first class with a patron. I was floating in a huge pool, feeling the cool desert breeze. For some reason, I lifted my hand to the sky like this, and felt the wind caress it. Then it occurred to me. What the hell am I doing here? I suddenly started doubting everything. No more seducing women. I wanted to do something useful with my life. We need a roadie, not a manager. Sure. Roadie, or whatever. Guitar tech, programming... - But why us? - I like your style. Your music, and your lyrics. This is him? - You were a male companion? - Right. Cool. You seem trustworthy. Not much to look at though. One rule. We keep it platonic. Ladies. Whoa dude! Are you serious? The ex-owners signed a major deal after six months. Now they headline fests. So, we'll follow suit, and take this as far as we can. We're not doing this to sell out. They all say that, but no success, no future. - Un- Sure, but... - Dream big! To the Budokan. To the Grammys! To singing fill we die! July 15th, 2018 Room9, Yokkaichi Inside a sudden storm Wind pierces deep into my eyes Reality and a towering wall Attack and wrap around me Even days as monotonous as these Fly past in a flash As our journey goes on 6,500 yen. Shame about the poor turnout today. Here. - That rumor about Haruleo breaking up. - No. Well, rumors like that spring up about every group. If it is true, making it public would draw bigger crowds. Fans are watching, Haru. Night comes. My body burns, and a single word tumbles out. Freezing cold to the touch... You're playing much better. Let's keep it up. Night comes. My body burns, and a single word tumbles out. Freezing cold to the touch, so much that I instantly let it go. Another word I no longer recognize escapes from me again today. Well... I don't know, it's like... ...falling in love with someone, I guess. I mean, it feels kinda like that, but... That's not all. It comes from a deeper place. Like love, and despair... All exploding outward, you know? It's like, they get into the cracks in your heart, and stir everything up. Hey, you two. Wait a second. Tell me about them. Well... Goodbye lips Now who will I say goodbye to while gazing at you Goodbye lips Right now, for the first time I know the pain I feel right here is love I'm here with indie music darlings Haruleo, who are unstoppable right now. The secret to your music's appeal is your wonderful lyrics, Haru. I'm such a huge fan... I really am! For example, "Goodbye Lips." It sounds like a final farewell to the lips of someone loved dearly, but you could also interpret it as a farewell to a past self, like making a positive change in your life. Listeners can find their own meaning in it. It's so emotional, and so profound... But not just its lyrics. Its composition is really powerful and soothing... Haru, you compose the songs too? - Yes, but... - You're a genius! But the lyrics and the music work because of Leo's voice... Of course, Leo's voice is lovely. But the music, and the lyrics... How can I put it? They intertwine, and then Haru's voice... Yours too, Leo. But your voice, Haru... I really am a huge fan. - Thank you. - You're so talented. Emotions shelter in the wind And the trees And the sky When clouds are torn apart Then lean together, becoming one It shakes my soul and makes me want to sink to the ground. See you at 4. Peter Green at his peak. A British blues rock masterpiece. Might not be your thing. - What's your thing then? - Me? How long did it last? From high school fill I turned 24, so... Seven or eight years? Thought I would? You thought I could. - I didn't. - I know you did. But I won't. I wouldn't want my CD smashed. - Take it, Shima. - Why? Even I don't know what I might do. You need to show some balls. Why are you such a wimp? If you like Haru, don't think, just go for it. What the hell? Haru's cool. Next to her, I'm just a piece of furniture. You're just as cool. Then come on to me. If I'm as cool as her, come on to me! "Keep it platonic," remember? What about smoking in the car? Haru broke that rule right away. Rules are meant to be broken. We're breaking up anyway. July 16th, 2018 Lipstick Nishitenma, Osaka I let this train carry me even though it'll stop somewhere Feeling the flow of time and waves of people against my skin Wishing I could be like someone Wishing I could be loved like them I close my eyes, cradle my wounds, and sleep Music plays in my ears As I count my slowly falling tears Everybody has a story but we go on living Count me among you as I play my guitar I don't expect you to understand everything I just want to sing about it Thank you. That was "Everybody Has a Story." It's a song that means a lot to us both. Everybody has a story. Many things worry and hurt us. We do things others can't understand. All of us here are like that, including myself. This song isn't meant to be some glib "hang in there" tune. This song isn't meant to be some glib "hang in there" tune. And that's why I wrote it. Back when we were performing on the street, there was a homeless man who lived near where we played. One day, he brought a chair, and a sign around his neck, saying "Massages, 100 yen for 10 minutes." He set up shop. So I thought, "Good for him." "He's trying to turn his life around." At the same time, I thought, "No chance." He was homeless, and looked like he hadn't bathed in days. Who on earth would want to sit in that guy's chair? However, one night, a woman came and sat down. With red hair. Probably worked at a bar. She didn't seem scared at all, and just sat as he massaged her shoulders. She was really enjoying it. "Wow, good for her," I thought. I was moved more by that woman than the homeless man. I wished I could be more like her, and hated myself because I wasn't. With all those feelings in my heart, I'd like to sing our next song. "Goodbye Lips." My temperature was rising And I think you could tell So instead of opening my eyes, I hesitated Two seconds later, we realized this was the end Then we unnaturally faked a smile I'm fine with this thorn staying stuck inside me Because it'll always remind me of you Goodbye lips Now who will I say goodbye to while gazing at you Goodbye lips Right now, for the first time I know the pain I feel right here is love They're good. Take care of them, or else. I will. Gotta go. Well hello, Shima from Kill Himself. First aid kit! Let's not do this here. He was a guitarist with a rival band, and dating their vocalist. I came on to her, and things got messy. They eventually broke up, despite being more popular and talented. You're so dumb. So? What's wrong with being dumb? I was wrong. And dumb. I wasn't even in love with her. Sex might've changed that. Sex didn't change that. What's that? Communing with nature. Where's Haru? - Gone. - Gone?! We've got two free days, so she'll go it alone. Till the next gig. So, you met her family? That's not really a secret. Whatever. I drove her home for her dad's second memorial service. She told me to dress like an office worker, so I wore a suit and tie. Basically, she used me. To reassure her family. - Nice people, right? - Nice people. I wished I was their son. Haru's mom showed me a photo of her childhood friend. Really pretty. She researches space engineering at NASA now. The photo was on a postcard they sent. To her mom. That girl was Haru's first love. She didn't hide it. She told me on the way home. - Were you hurt? - Yeah. I was. But Haru's suffered way more than me. She can't even tell her family about it. That's gotta hurt like hell. - Shima, let's hit a hotel. - Are you crazy? You listened to Haru, now listen to me! Leo... Leo... Leo. If we did that, we could never go back. Fine with me. We're already broken. - So why not? - No, can't. - It make you love me. - I do, but I can't. No more dumb mistakes. Alright, I get it. Come back. Leo. I'll take you to the station. Leo! You'll be back, right? - What? - Where'd you go? Can't go for a walk? I went over there. Felt good. Where's Leo? She's... - What? - Well, she's... I need to wash clothes. This car reeks of smoke. Coins. I'm taking a walk. Don't look. I'll buy smokes. What's your name? Leo. Where's your mom? You like your mom? What about your dad? Leo, let's talk. Leo. I don't want to watch you fall apart. Please. Hearing that from you makes me more of a loser. Let's go. Haru's waiting. Hey. Hey, Leo! What are you up to?! Shima! Hey! Tomorrow, we'll pick Shima up from hospital together. - Or I could... - Shima... ...risked his life for me. So what? I don't mind if you two get together. From the first time I met him, I knew you'd end up that way. I would've already if I could. I would've already if I could, dammit! But... Who did he really risk his life for? Huh? Hey Haru. What am I doing music for? Forget your reasons. What am I doing it for?! If you don't know, quit already! July 19th, 2018 Manbou House, Niigata Music plays in my ears As I count my slowly falling tears Everybody has a story but we go on living Count me among you as I play my guitar I don't expect you to understand everything I just want to sing about it Now for our last song. - Leo, don't quit! - Don't abandon us! - I love Haruleo! - Don't break up! I'm yours forever! How come they all know we're breaking up? I'm turning down offers. They were bound to catch on. Some venue person must've leaked it. But it's a good thing. All your shows'll sell out. Like a farewell tour should. Right? You're breaking up. Aren't you, Leo? Well? In five days, we'll be strangers. Gotta go out with a bang. Your show today was amazing. So moving. Shima. What? When Haruleo breaks up, you'll team up with Leo? Won't you? How can you say that? You should do it. For Leo too. With you, it's always Leo, Leo, Leo! Forget her! Think of yourself! You deserve to live too! Would thinking help? How the hell would I know? But I wish you would. When you don't smile, it hurts me inside. Please. You feeling sorry for me makes me feel more pathetic! I don't feel sorry. I've loved you too much And I just can't stop The way I feel about you Nights when I was 19 Nights when I was 20 Nights when I was 21 Then she came And she left And now I'm here waiting for her again Well? Sound like a hit? - Hi. - Hey there. - Hello. - Hello. You're late. I couldn't miss practice. I met the priest. This is it. Haru's childhood friend. They'll have a second child next year. You got it too, right? Adults point at me and whisper to their children. Don't grow up like her. I wake from a dream and drink water. The taste of that water stays with me even today. The green room's that way. July 21st, 2018 Back Alley, Sakata Attack and wrap around me Even days as monotonous as these Fly past in a flash As our journey goes on One radio and two magazine interview requests. Okay? Thought so. We give water to our hearts even though they'll stop one day We make them beat fast and make them run away We rage, we hurt, we cry Then rage, laugh, and love again Trying to boil water that never seems to burst out In the fissures within our lives We collect trickling drops of hope Everybody has a story but we go on living Count me among you as I sing this song I don't expect you to understand everything In two days time, we'll break up, so let's eat together. Good, right? What'll you two do once you break up? Got any plans? - Have you? - I do. I know a guitar maker in Gifu. I'll be an apprentice. And you, Leo? I'll work at some factory for a while. Gotta pay off my back rent. Or I'll have nowhere to live. Haru? What'll you do? I'll... I feel off today. - I'm so dumb. - What's wrong with that? Sorry. I gotta go back to my hometown. A friend died. You two'll have to go on to Hakodate. After the wake and funeral, I'll meet you at the gig. Haru, you drive. You two can do it, right? - We'd better go now... - No. Finish eating first. It's probably our last meal together. Were you that close? You and your friend. We were best friends. Bandmates for half our lives. We'll be playing the big room instead. - Don't force yourself... - I want to! I'll...do anything for you. If... ...you keep being Leo, and Haruleo stays together, that's enough. "Loading Area" Kanemori Hall - Leo, all good. - Thank you. You're next, Haru. Haru, all good. - See you later. - See you later. Er, what about this guitar? Oh, I'll do it. Thanks. Leo. Go sign stuff outside. It's your last chance. - There. - Thank youl Please. - There. - Thank youl Please sign this. July 24th, 2018 Kanemori Hall, Hakodate - Set list? - Same as always. Who shut the back door? Nearly ruined my good looks. Before he died, my friend told his young son, "Never ever become a musician." "If you do, you'll lose what's most precious in life." But I don't agree. I've never regretted it. And I never ever will. You know? Okay, let's do this. - I'm Haru. - I'm Leo. We're Haruleo. I'm going away to get to know loneliness I don't need a companion for now On the side of a road that wasn't really a road A cat with feeble eyes meowed at me Saying please, give me something to dream about I can't be sure The way forward isn't clear Although we've barely spoken at all Come along with me Somewhere down the line A storm is bound to come but we'll be alright Let's keep walking till we reach the sea Some fearsome beast might be waiting for us If I said I'll use my feeble claws to scratch it and protect you would it make me stronger? This time for sure I'll show you I can shine Farewell to that day when I was down in the gutter If I can't help but grow weak Let me sleep in your arms again Inside a sudden storm Wind pierces deep into my eyes - Reality and a towering wall... - They're breaking up too, huh. I can't be sure The way forward isn't clear Although we've barely spoken at all Let's keep going Somewhere down the line A storm is bound to come but we'll be alright Feeling the flow of time and waves of people against my skin Wishing I could be like someone Wishing I could be loved like them I close my eyes, cradle my wounds, and sleep Music plays in my ears As I count my slowly falling tears Everybody has a story but we go on living Count me among you as I play my guitar I don't expect you to understand everything I just want to sing about it Everyone has their own history. Songs have their own destiny and history too. And today, we'll let go of our music. When this song that we'll sing leaves us, how will it survive? Will it remain in your memories and create a new history? Or will it disappear along with Haruleo? Whatever may come, we'll accept it, and sing this song. "Goodbye Lips." My temperature was rising And I think you could tell So instead of opening my eyes, I hesitated Two seconds later, we realized this was the end Then we unnaturally faked a smile I'm fine with this thorn staying stuck inside me Because it'll always remind me of you Goodbye lips Now who will I say goodbye to while gazing at you Goodbye lips Right now, for the first time I know the pain I feel right here is love I hid my own weakness Pretending it was something else I can't go on like this anymore Icy lips Right now your eyes look so kind and sad Untangled lips Even so, I know for sure Goodbye lips Now who will I say goodbye to while gazing at you Goodbye lips Now I will say goodbye to myself and thank you Goodbye Goodbye You girls are free now. Go home, sleep, and have a nice life. Sorry, I'm not your roadie anymore. Carry your own stuff. What are you doing? It's too heavy. Me first. Shima, drop me at my place. Shima, think hard about who you owe more to. You two really are dumb. - How so? - Because... - What's wrong with that? - Because! - You hungry too? - Hell yeah. Fine, we'll eat first. But don't say Haruleo's reforming. Don't you dare say that. Not after that unforgettable last show. Don't you dare. Well, anyway, let's go eat. - Yeah. - Don't you dare. Don't you dare say that. Don't you dare. I'm sick of dealing with your shit. Dammit... Even days as monotonous as these Fly past in a flash As our journey goes on I can't be sure The way forward isn't clear Although we've barely spoken at all Let's keep going Somewhere down the line A storm is bound to come but we'll be alright
