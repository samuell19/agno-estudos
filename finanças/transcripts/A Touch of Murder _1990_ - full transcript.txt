(MultiCom Jingle) (pensive guitar twanging) - [Man] Hello? Hello! - How doing Curtis? - I got some good stuff for you. - Oh yeah? - You wanna see? - You didn't steal it, did ya? - No, I bought it, paid good money. - Maybe. It's all pretty old stuff. - [Curtis] It's antiques. - Who's that? - That my brother. - [Business Owner] Friendly. - Hey Beamer. Call him Beamer 'cause he's psychic. - [Business Owner] Oh yeah, Beamer? - [Curtis] Yeah, he talks to animals too. - [Business Owner] (laughs) That's quite a talent. - [Curtis] If he touches you, he'll know everything you ever did, so watch yourself. - He talk to people? - [Curtis] Not too much. (laughing) - [Business Owner] Voodoo bullshit. - Look, how about this vacuum cleaner? You could clean up your shop with it. - I don't wanna clean it up. - [Curtis] And you're gonna be happy with that. - [Business Owner] Yeah, I'm sure. - 40 bucks. 30 bucks. 20. - [Business Owner] 20 and I'm not gonna argue. - Done. Beamer! Come and grab this man's brand new vacuum cleaner. You're not gonna regret this. - [Business Owner] Yeah, right. - [Man] Mankind was designed for accomplishments. Endowed with the seeds of greatness. Man is engineered for success. Opportunity lies with the individual. Hmm, you're impressed, aren't you? - Yes I am, but-- - But you're wondering what this beauty costs, am I right? - Yes, exactly. - Well, I'm sure that you can see that a complete home maintenance system such as this, is a fairly expensive proposition. - Oh yes. - I want you to tell me what you think the price is. Don't be shy. - [Woman] Well I... - Let's add it up. Now here is your state of the art in your traditional vacuum cleaner. Say $800. Floor polisher another three, rug shampooer another five, air compressor, $900 minimum. $2,500 total. - Oh that's much too much for me. - (laughs) What would you say if I told you I could give you the complete package for $1,500? You'd jump at it, wouldn't you? - Well that's a very good price but I-- - I'm just kidding Mrs. Anderson. I can't sell it to you for that. - It did sound a little too good to be true. - No, but I could give it to you for $1,000. - Well, that's splendid, but I still don't-- - Now believe me Mrs. Anderson I can't sell it to you for that either. - Well now Bobby, I think you're playing with me. - (laughs) I'm sorry I'm just in a terrific humor today. Anyway no, I can't sell it you for $1,000. I can't sell you this $2,500 package for $1,000 or $1,500 or even $2,000. The price is actually $799. Now I think for that amount you'd be prepared to go ahead with this investment, am I right? - I'm sorry Bobby. I would really, but it's just a little too much for me right now. - You like this machine, don't you Mrs. Henderson? - Oh, I like it. But it's just a little too much for me to spend right now. I have a very small pension you see. - You'd like to have one though? If you could afford it, I mean. - If I could afford it I'd love to have one. You're a very good salesman. - If I could show you how you could afford it, you'd jump at it, wouldn't you? - I suppose but there's no way-- - Could I use your phone for a second? Hello, Mr. Hickman? Yes this is Bobby Barnaby calling. I'm fine sir, how are you? Good, good, good. Sir, I'm over at Mrs. Henderson's this afternoon. And yes, yes she's very impressed with the machine sir. Yes, she'd love to own one. Well sir the problem is, is that well she just feels it's a little bit too much for her to spend at the moment. Uh huh. Well sir, I was just wondering, if we could possibly make an exception in her case? Yes I know that sir. Well it's just that her pension is very, very small. She's a very, very nice lady sir. You could? That's wonderful sir. Thank you very, very much. We're both very pleased. Thank you. Thank you very much. My best to your family. Right, I'll see ya at the club tomorrow night. Okay. Right-o, (laughs) right-o, bye bye. Great news Mrs. Henderson. My boss took 15% off the total price. I mean this is incredible because I can assure you, this has never happened in the history of Calvin Industries as we know it. - 15%? - It's a miracle. Hey, there's nothing to stop us now, huh? (whistling) (answering machine beeps) Your plant this afternoon popped. She called, wanted to go out, and write the contracts tomorrow. That's positive. Hello Mr. Hickman? Yes, this Bobby Barnaby calling. Uh I'm fine sir, how are you? Good, good. (machine scrambles) It's just that her pension is very, very small. (machine scrambles) (alarm buzzes) (energetic music) Yes, yes, yes yes yes yes yes, yes. You can get everything in life you want if you help enough other people get what they want. You can get everything you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want. Yes. Stop counting time. Start making time count. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. (laughs) Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Today, is the first day of the rest of your life. - [Man] On tape number five, you'll recall we discussed the consequences of a poor self image. You have seen that a low level of self esteem can paralyze your career and cripple your earning potential. You have confronted negativism face to face and told him, no thank you sir, I believe in myself. Having forsaken the negative, you are now prepared to take the positive into your heart. Cradle it there as you would a puppy or a small child. You are learning the rules to the game of life. Life, like any game, has winners and losers. People who accomplish their goals and people who fail. And what is the simple difference between accomplishment and failure? - The right mental attitude. - [Man] The right mental attitude. - Are you playing the game of life without any goals? - [Lady] If you are, what's the score? - How you doing Deb? - Super good Bobby, how you doing? - Any better I'd be arrested. - You got a visitor. He's waiting inside. - I'm going right out. Gimme the best you got. I'm hot today. (phone rings) - Good morning, it's a great day at Calvin Industries. - You Mr. Barnaby? - If I'm not he owes me money. (men laughing) - [Guest] So you are Mr. Barnaby? - I don't think I've had the pleasure. - I'm Lucas Henderson. You sold my Grandmother a vacuum cleaner yesterday. - Your grandmother is? - Lucille Henderson. - (laughs) Yes of course, Lucille. Fantastic lady. - Right. - You're her grandson? - Uh huh. - That's great. I'll tell you what, I am really racing against my agenda today so why don't we make an appointment for later in the week, that way we'll have more time to chat? Just gimme a call. - Uh, my grandmother can't keep the vacuum cleaner. - (laughs) Lucas, the Calvin is hardly what I call a vacuum cleaner. It's a complete home maintenance system. At any rate, we'll pick it up right here, say Friday? - Mr. Barnaby, whatever it is, my grand-- - Please, please. Call me Bobby. - My grandmother can't afford it. - I see. - Okay? - And what seems to be the problem exactly? - Well there's problem really. See it's just my grandmother supports herself on a very small pension plan. - I understand - So there's no way she could-- - and appreciate your concern, Lucas. In fact it was my concern. I wasn't sure your grandmother should invest in the system. She loved it and she wanted it badly. But I wasn't sure. But after a detailed examination of her finances, we worked out a nice, convenient payment plan. Which worked our very, very nicely. - A payment plan? - A payment plan. That way your grandmother can spread her payments over three years. I hope that puts your mind at ease. Listen, I really gotta go. If you've got any questions at all, you just, don't hesitate, just gimme a call. - Okay, look Mr. Barnaby, I just want you to take the machine back today, okay? You understand? (Bobby laughs) Really. - Lucas, she's very fond of that machine, she loves that machine. - I contacted the bank. She has three days to cancel the contract. So I suggest you take it back today. - I understand. - Alright, three days. - I understand. If you could just tell me precisely what the problem is. - Okay look Mr. Salesman, I just want you to take the machine back. That's all. - Ball buster. - Yeah, I'm sorry buddy. That was really super terrible. - Can't happen. I need Henderson for that contest. She put me over the top. That's a trip to Atlantic City just walked out the door. - Can't happen? - Can't. You don't drown if you fall in the water. - Only drown if you stay there. - That's a positive. - Almost doesn't buy anything in the game of life. There is no commission on a sale you almost make. Or fun in a trip that you almost take. (ominous music) Immutable laws of the universe positively state a man reaps what he sows. Sow hard, play hard. I understand and appreciate what you're saying Lucille. Lucas just has your best interests at heart. - I feel terrible about the whole thing. - I'm just disappointed. I'm really, really disappointed. - I'm sorry Bobby. It's all my fault really. - I'm sorry too Lucille. I look at you now and I see that you want something, I do the best that I can do get that for you. If not I'm not doing my job. You see that, don't you? - Yes. (unsettling music) - I've tried to bring happiness to people. - [Lucille] I'm sure you have. - But right now I, right now, I can see how unhappy you are and it's breaking my heart, it's tearing me up inside. I mean, I mean you can see that, can't you Lucille? - You don't seem yourself. - No. I came back here to take this machine back. But I am slowly realizing that I just, I can't do that. It wouldn't be fair to you. I wouldn't be doing my job, I wouldn't be bringing you happiness. I mean you do realize that, don't you Lucille? - Now Bobby, Lucas told you that-- - Lucas, is a wonderful man. But we can't let him run our lives now, can we? We're talking about you now. You, Lucille Henderson. - Bobby I'm so-- - I mean it is your happiness we're talking about. If you're unhappy, then I'm unhappy. What we send out, always comes back to us. If I stand in the valley and shout you should be happy, do you know what I hear? An echo telling me you should be happy. Life is an echo. Go ahead, shout you should be happy. Do it Lucille, you should be happy. Come on, come on do it with me. You should be happy. You should be happy. You should be happy. (laughs) You should be happy. Say it with me. Say it with me Lucille. Thank you very much for the tea Mrs. Henderson. I'm glad we had a chance to straighten things out. And don't forget. If you have any problems with the machine whatsoever, you just call and I'll come running. Here, I'll give ya my card. Just remember you're part of the family now. Have a good day. (unsettling music) You should be happy. You should be happy. (laughing) Yes, yes, yes yes yes yes yes. - [Man] To maintain this healthy self image, it's not a bad idea to make a list of your positive qualities on an index card and keep it with you for handy reference. Ask your friends what things they like about you and add them to the list. You're probably overdrawn at the bank of confidence. Tactics like this one will help you get back in the black. - Grandma? Grandma? (phone rings) - Yes, just one moment please. Hold the line. Oh looking good Bobby. - Stuffing myself with the feast of life. - Oh, save some for the rest of us. Good afternoon, it's a great day at Calvin Industries. - Pinch me Mr. Trump, I'm dreaming. - [Man] Congrats man. - (laughs) You shoulda seen me yesterday. It was genius. I hate to admit it, but it's true. - Good pitch huh? - This pitch was perfection. I must have closed her at least 15 different ways. Two and a half hours. I admit there was a moment when I thought to myself this wasn't going to happen. But at that second, I knew I had her, because it wasn't me talking. - I could really use some of that. - Ah cheer up Stan, you're slumping, it happens. I've been down that road before. Look at me now. - [Stan] Yeah, you're right. - Yeah, I'm right, I'm right. Oh, she was tough. I'm still sweating. - [Stan] Eh, she give ya a tough time? - Tough? I was there for two and a half hours! I mean we're talking Frazier-Ali here, you know? But I didn't for the decision you know. Knock out, boom, ah boom. (tense music) (knocking at door) Sweat on a brow from honest labor. It's like a glistening star in the galaxy of life. True satisfaction can only be derived from effort expended in a quest for a just and worthy ideal. Success is easy when you believe. Failure nearly the path of least persistence. - Are you nuts? What are you doing? Hi. - Get outta here now. - No. Not now. - What do you want? You want money? - I want you to get your ass out here. - Why? What are you gonna do? - Okay look, you wanna stay in there? Fine. - If you came to talk about what we discussed yesterday morning, your handling of the situation is very unprofessional. You can't stay here. Now if you wanna make an appointment, that's fine. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to call the police. - We haven't talked yet. Okay now sit over there. Sit down. - Violence will not accomplish anything. - [Lucas] No? Sit down! - Obviously you're upset. And I can appreciate that, huh. If you just tell me what your problems are, then maybe we can resolve our differences. - Okay look, if you don't stop pretending that you don't know what this is about, I'm gonna bash your head in, alright? Now tell me what happened? Just tell me what happened? - I saw your grandmother earlier today. And she convinced me to keep the machine there. I mean isn't that what she said. - No. She didn't say anything. Do you know why? She's dead. - Lucille passed away? - [Lucas] Yeah, you didn't know that? - No. I swear to God, Lucas. She was fine when I left her. - You gotta do a lot better than that. - (laughs) I sold her. Sold, not killed. (sighs) What can I do to make you believe me? - [Lucas] I don't know. - My word is all I have. - You wanna know something? You remind me of every single thing that I hate! - Okay, hey, let's talk. Let's talk about that, huh? I mean we're both sensitive, intelligent people. You didn't come here to hit me over the head with a golf club. - Uh huh, yeah, I did. That's exactly what I came here for. - Okay, okay, okay. If you just tell me precisely what it is you want-- - Oh, precisely? - And I can help you get-- - You wanna know precisely what it is I want from you? - Okay, I want you to convince me why I shouldn't do this thing. Okay? - Okay. - And quickly. Is that precise enough for ya? - Okay, no bullshit. No bullshit Lucas, no bullshit. Here it is. Okay? I'm sick of it, I'm tired of it. You came to me to take the machine back. Look, I sell for a living. If I packed it in every time somebody said no, I'd be flat broke. Sure I gave you the run around. I'm trained to do it, that's the way it is, like it or not. I pressured your grandmother into keeping the machine. I'm being very honest with you here. I hope you know that. I convinced her to keep a vacuum cleaner, that she, you're right, she probably couldn't afford. 90% of the people that I sell to can't afford it. But that's my job, that's what I have to do. If I could find another job I would, but I can't. Don't you think I know what they say about salesmen, huh? I feel ashamed, I'm disgusted. I, I needed her. I needed her sale for a contest. I won a trip to Atlantic City. I'm so ashamed. I only hope to God that it wasn't me that caused her death. There it is. I'm so sick of this god damn job. I hate it. - That's very good. Yeah, you're a good salesman. Huh? That was great. But you know what? I still feel like I should hurt ya. I don't know why, I just feel like I should hurt ya, you know what I mean? - [Bobby] I know. - You depress the hell outta me. What do you call that? - I'm really sorry about your grandmother. - No, your speech. What do you call that? - Lucas, I meant every word I said. - Yeah? - I'm a successful business man. Sincerity is the fiber of my being. - You're a good salesman. (glass shatters) - He's back. I had a dream. In which I'd achieved all of the goals that I'd set for myself. Sure, those goals included a lotta money, (laughs) a beautiful home, a German automobile, all of the material accoutrements of success. But what I remember most about that dream was the way I felt about myself. I felt good. And I woke up and I swore to myself that I would do the right thing. I would respond to the dreams that God gave me. Well today the dream is a reality. I have responded. (crowd applauds) It's taken years to develop the right mental attitude. Negative thinking, negative action and reaction are the stock and trade of Mr. and Mrs. Mediocrity. You are so fortunate to live in a land where one can get anything they really want, provided they take the necessary steps. What is the world's most deadly disease? Not cancer. It is the hardening of the attitudes. Once I was sick, now I am well. (crowd applauds) Thank you. (guitar twanging) - You could make your own commercials with this little baby. - Geez, it's got to be 50 years old. Does it work? - It's a piece of history. - Not interested. - [Curtis] Solid iron, through and through. They don't make 'em like this anymore. You can sell it in a second. - It's hot. - But it's not hot, hot. I mean, it's legal. - [Business Owner] How much? - For you, 25 bucks and I'll help you carry it inside. - 15 and I'll watch you carry it inside. - Beamer! Gimme a hand with this. (startling music) - Whoa! - [Curtis] What's the matter? Ah, he's got a hangover. - [Man] I know this is difficult for you Michael. And I'm sure you don't feel much like talking right now. I can understand that. But you're, are you listening? You're gonna have to eventually. I knew your father, I worked with him. Michael? - It's Mickey and I know you know my dad, because we met. It was a long time ago. You came over once. It was just a kid, you've forgotten. - I remember. - It was Dad's birthday. You brought a bottle of, no offense, cheap white wine, which you and Dad quaffed, talked cop. Mom liked you, said you should come more often. - You got a good memory. Have you seen your mom? - I saw her before I came over here. - He didn't talk with her. - Look, I know you know I'm going through a difficult time, so let's not bullshit around here. Mom's in shock, we didn't chat. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Mike, Mickey, sorry. I'm sure that you can see that we don't have a lotta choices here. We need to know the story and you're gonna have to tell it. - Dad drowned. - I'm talking about the circumstances. You found him, right? - (sighs) Well, it was pretty chaotic. Mom was flipping out. Everything was moving in slow motion. Like I was watching a movie. - Did you try and revive him? - I know what dead is. - [Cop] What did you do? - [Mickey] Well, naturally I've been instilled with a deep veneration for law enforcement. So I called the cops. - [Cop] Just like that, 911? - [Mickey] Yes. - Does it bother you that your father was a cop? (speaking in foreign language) (laughs) - Always faithful. - Thank you. You got an education on you there son. - [Mickey] I don't mean to annoy you. - Don't let it bother ya. - Alright. - [Cop] Was your father acting strangely? Did he seem... - Melancholy? - Depressed? Yeah. - [Mickey] He missed a lotta work. - [Cop] I know that. - Uh huh. - Why is that, do you think? - Are you asking me if I think he killed himself? Policemen do that, right? And dentists. - How do you drown yourself in a bathtub? - Determination. - More properly, I think, inspiration. - [Mickey] Touche. - French, right? - Wow. I'm glad we can joke about it. (shivering) - I understand that your grandmother passed away recently. - [Mickey] Yes. - Do you see any potential correlation there between that and your father's depression. - Of course. - They were close? - Biologically. - You gonna help me out here or what? - I'm sorry. Defense mechanism. - [Cop] I understand. Were they close? - Were. Dad sorta lost touch with her in the last few years. - Did he see her before she died? - Well, we flew down there. Mom couldn't go so she asked me to go with him, flew down there to see her. She was pretty sick by then. We all knew. Dad hadn't seen her for a year and a half. - I hope she's awake. If she's sleeping, I don't wanna get her up. - She knows we're coming. - I know, but if she's sleeping, just let her sleep. We can always just walk in and come back later. - Don't worry about it. - Stay with me for awhile, alright? - Sure. - Oh I'm sorry, you can't come in right now. - We're here to see Mrs. Prince. - Are you relatives? - Yes. - She passed away a few minutes ago. - [Mickey] We didn't stay long. Dad seemed sorta funny about the whole thing. Hurt, guilty probably. Didn't say much on the flight home. - [Cop] Would you like a drink or something? - No thanks. - You're okay, comfortable? So that's when you first noticed the change in his behavior? - Change? - [Cop] Depression. - There's that word again. I mean, normal reaction, wouldn't you say? - So then you'd say he took it well? Normally? He at first seemed okay? - Yes, he seemed okay. - You guys must be exhausted. - I slept a little on the plane. - Did you get any sleep Ken? - [Ken] No. - Maybe you should think about taking a couple of days off. - Really? - I was talking to your father. (utensils clanging on table) I think we're all just a little bit uptight here. - That's exactly it. Uptight. We're all just a little bit uptight. You two are like a god damn club. Spare me your conciliatory shit dear. - Just calm down. - I feel guilty, alright? I deserve it. So just tell me that sweetheart. Gratify myself, disgust you bitch? - [Woman] You deserve it. - [Cop] Why did you take him to the doctor? - How'd you know that? - We ask people questions, they answer. - [Mickey] Job has it's privileges. - Yes. Why did you take him to the doctor? - Mom thought he was sick. - [Cop] Sick how? - I'm not a specialist. Why don't you ask a specialist. - I did. - So why ask me? - I want your perspective. - [Mickey] He didn't seem himself. - [Cop] How do you mean? - I don't know, he just seemed a bit, disengaged. He was usually very even keeled. - He was a very strong man. - Amen. (metal music) What's going on? - I don't know, he came home an hour ago and he started this. - I can hear you know. - What is this? - Nothing, just listening to a little bit of music. Anything wrong with that? - This is not an improvement. - Well at least it's funny. - I called the station. He hasn't been to work. - What, all day? - Since you guys got back. He gets up every morning, gets dressed, and goes to I don't know where. He carries a gun for god's sake. Do you hear this music? - Well mom I don't think he's dangerous. - A match made in heaven. A marriage that isn't dangerous. - How'd you get him to go to a doctor? - He agreed to it. - Did he know that something was wrong? - Sure. - He did? What'd the doctor say? - Stress, gave him a prescription. - What did you think? - I was more worried about Mom. - Really? - Yeah. I thought she was overreacting. - As it turns out she wasn't. - [Mickey] Look, where are we going with all of this? - [Cop] Well we have to make sure that all the pieces fit together. We're doing an autopsy now, doing some tests on the water, that kinda thing, but with your education I'm sure you know that. - Oh like investigation. - I'm having a hard time believing that your father put his head under the water and took a deep breath. - [Mickey] Is there a problem officer? (unsettling music) - You tired? - A little, I'm okay. - Good. I just wanna say again how much we appreciate your help. - [Mickey] It's no trouble. - You took your father to see some other doctors. - Yes, neurologists and some more psychiatrists. He had PET scans, CAT scans, EEGs, X-rays, you name it. - And? - What does this have to do with drowning? - I don't know yet. - Plenty of ways to drown. - If you say so. Why did you take him to see other doctors? - Why do I get the feeling you know the answer to all these questions? - Not all. - (sighs) It was an episode, I guess you'd call it. - Psychological episode? - You're bullshitting again. If you know we took him to a doctor, then you also know it wasn't a proctologist. - Wow. I should know better. - Yes, psychological. Mom was worried. - You? - [Mickey] Yeah I was worried. - [Dad] Good morning. - [Mickey] Hi. - We look alike, don't we? - [Mickey] Yeah, I guess so. - You were conceived in there you know. - [Mickey] Where? - We used to take all our baths together. Me and your mother. We weren't much older than you are now. I can still imagine what it looked like, thrashing around in there. And suddenly you were with us. - Come on Mickey, we gotta get going. - No pain, no fanfare. - Oh for god's sake. - Sorry Mom. - [Cop] I understand that shortly after that your father got worse, that his condition-- - You understand? - Deteriorated. In what way? Hmm? I know that you took off school. Your mother quit teaching. - It got to a point where she couldn't do it alone. - You're a good son. (laughs) - [Man On Radio] U.S. is concerned regarding terrorism and planning attacks against a variety of targets in Western Europe and West Africa, including U.S. The warning is part of a new effort for the government to alert U.S. citizens to potential dangers following. (children outside yelling drown out radio). Starting early Friday, the day after. (children and utensils and dishes clicking drown out radio) 250 miles from the middle. Thursday's eruption is the volcano's first activity in 23 years, (children and utensils and dishes clicking drown out radio) And forced the evacuation of the southern oil workers. We have in the Western edge, (children and utensils and dishes clicking drown out radio) Number three U.S. auto makers, Friday announced. (children and utensils and dishes clicking drown out radio) Financing rates are being raised another two percent. - Are you gonna eat that Kenneth? You have to eat something. You haven't eaten for days. If you don't eat it yourself I'm gonna feed you. - Mom. Why don't you just eat the soup Dad? You're cleaning it up pal. (slaps reverberating) You little bastard! (tense music) Bastard, little bastard. - No, stop it, stop it! Stop it, stop it! (sobbing) - After that he got a lot worse? - [Mickey] You answer that. - He got a lot worse. - It was a kind of, I guess you'd call it a hysteria. Right? - I couldn't really pass that sort of a judgment. - Judgment. You haven't heard my plea yet. Mom? Mom. Mom? - Shh. - I need some help here. - Quiet. You'll wake your father. - I'm awake. Who are you? I said who the hell are you? - Just stop it. - [Mom] Mickey, go upstairs, I'll be up in a minute. - You be quiet, you heard what she said, you woke me up. - Shut up. - Go upstairs. - I don't understand anything here. I don't recognize anything here. You took my gun, I want it back. - Shut up. - [Mom] Mickey, go up to your room. - [Mickey] No I'm not going to. - I want my gun back. Who the hell are you people? If I had my gun I'd shoot you both in the stomach. Bang, bang. - Shut you up asshole. - Mickey. - Take another step and I'll kill this bitch so help me God. - Let me go. God dammit let me go. - One more, one more. - Let go of me. Let go of me god dammit. - (sighs) Did you think about having him committed? - No. - Why not? - Got a problem calling the state, right. Is that it? Some things are family. Why don't you just hit me over the head with this? - That's a telephone book. - I don't see any telephone. - [Cop] I'd like to get back to when you found the body. What time would that be? - Do I have to answer that question? - You don't have to answer anything. - 2:40, 2:45. - [Cop] You call us first or the ambulance? - [Mickey] You first. - [Cop] And we got there in about 20 minutes? - [Mickey] About that. - [Cop] The ambulance? - [Mickey] About the same time. - [Cop] Why was your father taking a bath in the middle of the afternoon? - He made a mess of himself, we put him in there. - How long would he have been alone? - [Mickey] 10, 15 minutes. - You left him alone that long? - It's hard to adjust to thinking of your own father as a child. - So the last time you saw your father was, earliest say 2:25? - [Mickey] Yes. - How long would he have been alone then? - About two minutes. Look you'd save us both a lot of time if you got to the point. - Well the water's pretty warm. - Given the volume of the tub you should be able to calculate pretty easily how fast the water temperature dropped. (tapping on glass) - I can see that you're a cop's son and you're absolutely right. Excuse me. Mickey, I'm going down to check the autopsy report. You want something to eat? - No, cigarette maybe. - I won't be long. (somber music) - What's gonna happen mom? - I don't know. - This isn't right. - I know. - Mom help me. - I can't. - Mom. Help me. - I can't! - Help me. Sorry Mom. - Were you afraid? (speaking in foreign language) Sorry to keep you waiting. We're almost finished now. - A job well done. - Just a few more details. It's this water temperature thing I can't quite figure out. - [Mickey] It was a hot bath. - I'd say so. - Look I'm not stupid. I know what you've been trying to get at for the past hour. Don't bullshit me, I told you that. - Yes you did. It's just that all the pieces don't quite fit together perfectly. - Detective, when it all comes together what do you have? - A picture. - Shit! - [Mother] What? - Tub's full of orange juice. There's orange juice in the tub. - [Mom] Why can't you just tell them that-- - No, nobody's gonna understand this Mom. - I just wanted to get loose. - Look, we have to calm down. - Tell them. - Calm down. Calm down, alright? - [Cop] We found some little things, but judging from your story he'd gotten pretty violent. He marked himself up too, huh? - Wouldn't surprise me. - And the water, well no big deal. Here's the thing. The water that we found in your father's lungs had traces of urine in it. Like he peed in the tub, which given his state is understandable. But the water that we took from the tub didn't show any urine. So either he drowned someplace else or you changed the water. Did you change the water Mickey? Why would you do a thing like that? - I'd like to see my mother now please. How are you feeling? It's gonna be okay. We have the right to remain silent. - Well, nothing else I want here except for maybe the TV. - You have an eye for quality. But I can't let this thing go for less than 50 bucks, and don't try to talk me down because I'm decided. - Does it work? - She's a pig. We'll plug it in. - Let's do it. If it works I'll give you $40. - And if it doesn't, give me $10. - [Business owner] $5 maybe. - Fire it up Beamer. Now that's just the antenna. - (laughs) It's not even turned on. - [Curtis] The cord's no good. Think I've got some more in the truck though. - There's nothing wrong with the cord. - [Curtis] Beamer, adjust the antenna will you? - [Business Owner] It's not even on. - [Curtis] Oh baby! (smooth jazz music) - [Man] Chance. You know that was against the rules. - [Man On Right] Like hell. - Look, don't make me embarrass you by getting the book. Use your common sense. I know what I'm talking about. - Get the book then, go ahead. - Forget it, just go ahead, cheat. What are you doin'? - I had doubles. - [Man In Plaid] And if you roll doubles again you're in jail. - Nah, it's my second. - And that's number three. Jail. - It's after the third. - [Man In Plaid] What's the point? Really, I mean what's the god damn point? (clattering) - Why don't you change it? - To what? - I don't know. Something good, some war shit. (phone ringing) Hello? Wasting time. We're working on it. Yeah, he's here. What's so strange? I don't know. If I'm awake then I am. What's the big deal? You knew that when you married me. For whenever I call and nobody can find you. Yeah. Yeah, well you come in 7:00 a.m., fresh as a daisy. How do I know you're not playing night nursie with some asshole? You tell me. I knew it. - [Man On Right] What? - [Man In Plaid] I god damn well knew it. - Knew what? - She's lying. - [Man On Right] Who? - Who? Julia. - She's lying? - Yeah. - About what? - About what, what else? You don't get it do you? - Get what? No. - She's seeing somebody. - Julia, our Julia? - [Man In Plaid] Julia. - Your wife. - My wife, she's seeing someone. - It's stupid. - I can tell. - What, she told you? - Yeah she just told me on the phone, I could just tell, it's in her voice you know. Something, something suspicious. - Oh, suspicious. - I'm very sensitive to it. - Like what. - Like this isn't the first time I felt it either. Before we were married I had it a few times. - Had what? - This feeling. (man laughs) (explosions booming on TV) (men yelling on TV) - What time is it? - [Man In Plaid] I don't know. - Christ, put that down. - What, you're afraid of guns? - Yes, yes I am. - You've never killed anything in your whole life, have you. - No, I haven't. - Come hunting with me sometime. I'll teach you a thing or two. - [Man On Right] About killing? - About living. - I have to go soon. - What, you have somewhere to go? Got a rendezvous, dentist maybe? Fix it. No, use the thing. Just once and I swear I'll kill-- Pay attention to what you're doing for Christ's sakes. - It doesn't work, what do you want? - I want to know who he is. That's not too much to ask. Just who he is and when I can rip his heart out. - Don't. - Could be you for all I know. That's worse. - It's not gonna get any better. - I've sort of thought it might be you. I had a few clues, is it? - What? - [Man In Plaid] You? - Oh, yes, yes it is. - Don't make jokes. - Don't, I'm serious. - I asked you a question. - It's pissing me off. Don't! - Yes or no? - Look, stop it or I'm gonna smash the stupid thing. - Go ahead. - No, just stop it, I won't have to. - Go ahead, really, I dare you. Funny. - It's your own fault. - I was kidding. Kidding, there's a difference. - [Man On Right] Relax. - It was brand new. Julia bought it for me on our honeymoon. It's Swiss. Ah, to hell with it. Europe, who needs it? You too. It's so strange. Yeah, well you come in 7:00 a.m., fresh as a daisy, how do I know you're not playing night nursie with some asshole? You tell me. (glass shattering) - What's up? - Double dare, me against you. - You serious? - No, I'm joking, I just feel like having this conversation. - I don't get it. - Sure you do, it's a test. - A test? - That's right. - Of what? 500 bucks, chow down. - Each. - [Man Smoking] No, for all of 'em. - Come on. - Okay, $1,000 for the first one, $200 each for the other two. Come on don't be a wimp, it's not that bad. - Yeah I know that. It's just that I hate seafood. - Okay then shut up, give me the 1,000 bucks. - Are you kidding? - [Man Smoking] Have to swallow it. - I know, it's just... Fun huh? - Riot. (laughing) - [Man Smoking] This too? - Everything. - [Man Smoking] This is humiliating. - Why? - Okay. - And the rest. - Nah, this is getting stupid. I have to go home soon. - [Man At Window] Why, you late for your date? - No I just want to go home, that's all. - You giving up? I win. - There. Happy? - Now a song. - No, I've gone this far, that's far enough. - That's the deal pal. Hey you're gonna sing. - No way. - Did you hear that? - What? - Shh. Oh Christ, I think my wife's home. - [Man In Dress] What? - Julia's home. - She's home? - Julia's home! - What, that's impossible. - Quick, get in the closet. - What? - [Man At Window] Get in the God damn closet. - [Man In Dress] Are you there? Hey, I can't open the doors. - Little queen in the closet. Hey what did you mean there, impossible? - [Man In Dress] Come on, let me out. - When I said Julia was home you said impossible. - [Man In Dress] Let me out, now! Let me out, and I'll-- - I mean how would you know it was impossible for my wife to be home? - [Man In Dress] Please, she's at work. - What time does she finish? - [Man In Dress] Okay, I have to get out of here right now, the game aside, really! - Answer. - [Man In Dress] It was just a reflex, I don't know, I didn't mean anything. Please I'm starting to feel sick. - Uh uh. You tell the truth and then and only then will I let you out. - [Man In Dress] Let me out you bastard. - No way. - [Man In Dress] Okay not it's not funny let me out of here. - Did you touch my wife? Did you touch my wife? - [Man In Dress] What? - Did you fuck my wife? - [Man In Dress] Let me out of here right now. - Did you fuck my wife? - [Man In Dress] Yeah sure, yeah, yeah. Anything you want, let me out of here! Let me the fuck out of here! What? (exclaims) (tense 80's music) - Hey what's the matter pal? You're not leaving are you? What's that? I didn't hear you. - I didn't say anything. - I hope this doesn't mean we can't still be friends. Does it? I mean, you being my wife's boyfriend and all. Come on, lets make up. No hard feelings, okay? What do you say, huh? - Okay man, truce. - Yeah. That's right, truce. - Yeah. - That's the spirit. Do I look stupid to you John? Hmm? Do I? I must look pretty stupid to you, yes? Here's my questions. I have a question, here's what it is. Are you ready? Okay. Where, where John do you get the balls to do this to me, hmm? Where? That's my question. Where did you get the balls and can I have some please? - You're paranoid. - Everyone keeps telling me that. Why does everyone keep telling me that? Turn around and somebody tells me that. - We're wasting time. - Oh, that's right. Sorry I forgot. You came to play, right pal? - That's what it's all about, pal. - I'll drink to that. Cheers. Now here's the rules. Please make sure that you obey the rules, there's just no point in playing the game if you don't follow them. - I agree. - Now I'm gonna pour this real slow into here, all you have to do is just sit there, got it? Oh, I forgot. There's a bonus. Don't you want to hear what it is? I'm gonna take a drink every time you say the following. I will not sleep with my friend's wife. Okay? I will not sleep with my friend's wife. Got it? Got it? - Yeah. - Oh, I forgot, there's another thing. If the bottle is empty and you're still alive, you can kill me. Shall we? - I.. I will. I will not sleep with my friend's wife. I will not sleep with my friend's wife. - A few more times and you might make it. - [John] I will not sleep with my friend's wife. I will not sleep with my, I will not sleep with my friend's, I'm saying it! (hammer clicks) - Oh sorry, Jesus. - You, you gutless bastard. - Sorry, really. (laughs) - You gutless bastard!

I did it yesterday. - Shut up! - No, I did it okay. Now we play for real. We lay our cards on the table. Let the chips fall where they may. All that crap. - You son of a bitch, I'll kill you. - No no, no no. You'll die. So, let's wrap this up shall we? - [Man In Plaid] Whatever you say. - Oh, whatever I say? Great. - You gonna kill me? - No, it's very simple. You're gonna shoot your dog. - No way. - Come on Bill, come on. - That's nuts. - That's a good dog. Get your gun. Get your gun.
