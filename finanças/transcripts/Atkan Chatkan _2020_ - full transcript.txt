Music was his happiness.. And ‘Tansen Music Academy’ was his dream Tiwari Tea Stall Oh hello! Please have mercy on the glasses! They are fragile!

With him That’s how we fell in love. Gradually, people started appreciating my singing more. People started praising me more. He took a backseat. Why are you drinking again? Don’t touch the Pakhawaj when you are drunk. It’s disrespectful to our music. stop this why ? This is my house I will do whatever I want You sing well. Go sing somewhere. What is this...

NO .. please .. give her to me please give me my children go become a big singer take your stuff shown your true colors I cried, I begged. He didn’t give me my children nor did he ever let me back in the house. I thought of killing myself But the hope of seeing my kids again kept me alive Guddu had been coming to me for days and I couldn’t recognize him. And today, when I finally found him, my son hates me. how should I convince him? Will he never forgive me? I don’t know if you will forgive your mother or not. The decision is yours. I will not say she suffered more than you. But son, she has suffered a lot for you two. Sometimes we feel there is no greater pain beyond ours. And that is why we are not able to see how our loved ones also struggle with their pain I met Madhav too He didn’t say anything. I won’t ask why you have taken this decision. you might have some reasons or compulsions If you don’t participate in the competition tomorrow, your friends will be losing a huge opportunity. Who are you? What are you doing here? I am the Principal of Tansen Music School. oh? Your son is immensely talented . You should encourage him And how will that help? He won’t feed himself by being a musician on the street! I am talking about his future. If he wins the competition tomorrow , he can change his life. And yours. Guddu will not go anywhere. Get out of my house. That Principal was trying teach me what is good for my son. Stop, don’t hurt him Are you going to kill him? Let him be. This is a family matter. Leave. brother you are such a lunatic I will not spare you today You went to meet your mother? will you go again ? You want to be a musician ?

I don’t know if you will forgive your mother or not. The decision is yours. Nor will I say she suffered more than you. But son, she has suffered for you two a lot.
