(MultiCom Jingle) (panting) - They're all dying, one after the other. - But I don't know, I don't know if-- - [Shepherd] But you must save them for me. There they are. - [Doctor] Oh my God. - [Shepherd] Here we are, Grandfather. (weeping) Don't cry, the doctor's here. You will see that now everything will be all right. - You cannot stop me! I'm appointed by the emperor to investigate this case. - There is no more time for investigations. The sentence has been passed. - But you must at least allow me to speak to the accused. - They are no longer accused, they've been sentenced and tomorrow they'll be executed. - Stop! (thudding) (grunting) (coughing and groaning) (orchestral music) - [Guard] There is nothing more to say. - Tomorrow we'll all be dead. Tomorrow we'll all be dead, and it's my fault. There is no point in repeating to you that I didn't kill our master. I have been found guilty. That is the fact. And the law will punish you all, in the same way that it will punish me. And all I can say is that I would die to save each of you, if I could. I would die for you, Valeria, my sister, and my friend. And I would die for you, my wife, and for the child you carry. I would die to save each of you, but that's a privilege I'm not allowed. (thunder rumbles) - No one knows what will happen to us tomorrow. You're not the one who decides that. Neither am I, and neither does Silvan. (lightning crackles) Just as no one can decide whether tomorrow will be a rainy or a sunny day. (violin music) - Marcus. Marcus. Come away, Marcus. Come back home. - She is in there. My home is in there. (violin music) - I don't know what to say. There is no sign of violence. And they don't seem to be ill, perhaps they were poisoned. Although the oral cavity shows no sign of that. It is strange. - We know who did this. - It was the spirits. - They even killed the old olive tree. It was the oldest tree in Pompeii. - And where do these spirits come from? - They come out of the rocks. We have seen them. - And at night we always hear their voices, over there in the woods, at the top of the mountain. - Mount Vesuvius? - All the shepherds know it. That mountain is cursed. - Who is Valeria Drusilla? Who is she? - Here I am. - Follow us. - But it's not time yet, the execution's not-- - Sit down. Silence, move. - No, Valeria, no. - No, Valeria! - Attica! - I said move. - Annius! (door clangs) - [Tito] It would be such a waste to kill you. Are you afraid? - Less than you. You don't even dare to show your face. (Tito laughing) - Valeria, Valeria. I never seem to have control over you, and yet you are mine! (Valeria gasps) (Tito chuckles) - I belong to the city of Pompeii, not to you. - I am Pompeii. There must be something wrong with our laws if they oblige us to ruin something so beautiful. How can one leave a neck like this to the executioner? (Valeria cries out) Is that what you want, you want me to use force? I could do it, you know. It would be my right, and my pleasure. But then, what would there be left? No, I want to save you from the executioner. I do not wish to take his place. Love me, Valeria. You would be a slave only to me. The others, all the others, would be at your orders. - How can you even think I might accept something like that? - You are the one who must think. You have one night left in which to reach a decision. Guards! And the lives of your brother, your sister-in-law, and all the other slaves depend on it. Take her back to her cell. Look what you have made me do. - This time she will be yours. - (scoffs) Who knows? That girl is strong. Almost as strong as you. - Exactly. - But she thinks she's in love with that man Marcus. (chuckles) - We all waste time looking for love. Then, we discover things that are more important. - What are you planning to do? - Nothing. - One does not unsheathe a sword without a reason. - It is not a good time to go over your old lessons, Father. - Is it time to forget them? Despair is the worst general one can follow. - I cannot abandon Valeria. When she dies, I will follow her. - Do not do it, Marcus. Valeria would not want you to. - I want to. - Killing one's self to avoid pain is not the way a good solider behaves. - [Marcus] Then I'm not a good soldier. - Me-za. (dog whimpers) - But I can't refuse, Attica. I must accept Caledonius' offer. - But Valeria, don't you know what to expect? You know Caledonius is a monster. - If I refuse, that will be the end for all of us. - But we don't want you to pay such a high price. I will wake Annius. - No! Sh. No one. None of them must hear of this. I, and I alone accept to pay that price. - What about Marcus? - Please, Attica. Don't talk to me about him now. - This cannot be the only solution. - Can you think of another? (crowd cheering) (orchestral music) [Woman] He is victorious! - [Man] Tiberius-as! Long live the emperor! - Tiberius! - Long live the tribute! - [Woman] Long live the emperor! - [Man] Long live the emperor! - Don't touch it. - [Man Lying Down] Oh, oh, stop it Caledonius, he's always so stuffy. - Welcome to Pompeii, Tribune, Tiberius Lepidus. Did you have a pleasant journey from Rome? - I did not come here for pleasure, Duumvir Caledonius. - [Caledonius] Over here. Pompeii provides opportunities for pleasure, also to those who are not in search of them. - I will think about that when we have finished. - As you will see, Vespasian's Temple is ready to be inaugurated. The work undertaken to make my villa suitable for the emperor's needs will be finished in a couple of days. There is instead-- - A fourth guard post needs to be added to the main gate. I want to double the number of the men stationed at the villa, and I want them by the entrance to the baths. The emperor must feel safe here. - The emperor has no reason to fear anything. - Right. I was expecting to see an old friend here, Marcus Severius. He's an officer. Do you know where he is? (ominous music) - [Man] When did he arrive? - [Man] This morning. He is waiting for you in the courthouse. (dramatic music) - Tribune, the sentence has already been passed. Everything has been done in compliance with the law. At this point, well... - [Marcus] Tiberius! - Marcus, my friend. - I told you we would meet again. I didn't manage to do it, Tiberius. I failed. Valeria will be executed today. - That is exactly what I was explaining to-- - Sh! I am here, my friend, I'm here. - Here I am. I'm ready. (door slams) Caledonius, I'm... - Valeria. - Marcus! (Valeria crying) Calm down, my love, calm down. You mustn't cry anymore. There is no danger now. Your death sentence has been suspended until the Emperor arrives. Annius will have to stay in prison, but you and the other slaves can leave. - But how is that possible? - This is the man you must thank. - No, not me. Thank Marcus. If it hadn't been for him, I would have died in battle years ago. (boy gasps) - Fulvius, what's wrong? - [Tiberius] I'm sorry, I don't have the authority to free you from slavery. - You have given us back our lives, we can wait for our freedom. (Fulvius gasps) Fulvius! What happened, you're ill. - Now I've seen you, I already feel better. - The boy is ill. You, take him to the doctor immediately. - But I don't know if-- - Immediately, I said. - I'll see you later, as soon as it's dark. - All right, till later my love. - [Valeria] Come on, let's go. - You're lucky to have a woman like Valeria by your side. - And a friend like you. - [Tiberius] Now tell me everything you have discovered about the murder of Quintus Leronius. - And that's all. The problem is that part of the papyrus is missing, the part on which Quintus Leronius probably wrote the name of the place the map refers to. It was burned. - What did you say they were called? - Christians. It's a Greek word, from Christos which means-- - I know what it means. - You know of them? - Only by name. But in Rome, they remember them well. - What do you mean? - It's an old story. Tell me, are you sure they don't know anything else? - They wanted me to have them. Why should they hide anything else? - Rome has taught me that the best way to keep a secret is to reveal only half of it. I want to talk to these Christians myself. - Wait. - What are you doing? I don't want anymore. - I thought the wine in your glass was trembling. (Tiberius laughs) - You need a good night's sleep, believe me. But take me the see these Christians first. (dramatic music) (crockery rattling) (wine sloshing) (woman gasps) - Where is your husband? - Why do you want to see him? - I just want to talk to him. - My husband is not here, he's at the vineyard. He'll be back tomorrow. - Take him! - I don't think this is necessary. - [Tiberius] Let us deal with this. - Vetusius! We should not have trusted you. - Cuspius, Cuspius! Get out, leave, leave! (door bangs) - I'm Tiberius Lepidus, an imperial tribune. State your names and reason for your meeting. - Tiberius, no. They are my friends. - Trust me Marcus, I know what I'm doing. - [Guard] Come on. Let's go. - So, who are you? - My name is Aulis. I'm a slave. - Are you a Christian? - That's what they call us. Because we believe in Jesus Christ. - Wrong answer. That's what they call you because you hate the Roman gods. They look like ordinary people, don't they? They look calm, they adore an Oriental god. And what's wrong with that, you will ask me. Believe and allow others to believe, that's the custom of Rome, right? They instead do not. They think themselves superior. - They are innocuous people. - Innocuous, you say? Do you know what happened in Rome over 10 years ago? (crashing) (child crying) Mommy, mommy! - [Mother] Come with me, it's all right. - [Tiberius] I was still only a child, but I remember it as if it were yesterday. Two-thirds of the city was destroyed. And thousands of people died. My mother and father. Those who started the fire were innocuous people, just like these friends of yours. - Tribune Tiberius Lepidus, I don't know who started the fire, I can only express my sorrow for the suffering it caused you. (woman gasps) (sword rings) - I warn you, slave, do not make light of me. - Calm down, we're not investigating the burning of Rome. - Don't you understand? These people are fanatics. They are dangerous. - No. They believe in their god, as we believe in Rome. We were ready to die for Rome, and ready to kill. - I still am. Are you? I am only ready to die to save Valeria. - You've changed. They have changed you. Guards! (sniffing) - It smells like sulfur. Like sulfur. (panting with exertion) - Ah ha. I can't imagine how tiring this work must be. - Would you like to try? (laughs) - My husband told me you have a strong temperament. And this is not your only quality. Valeria, don't be afraid. Listen to my advice. This is not the right place for you. You're special. Do theses look like hands suited for washing floors? No. You deserve a tub like this, and slaves who serve you. Accept my husband's advice, not because it's the only way to avoid death, but because it's the only way life is worth living. Believe me. It would be a pleasure to have you here, with us. - You should try it sometime. - Try what? - Try to be loved. It's obvious that this has never happened to you. - Love? Hmm. (laughs) Love. (laughing) (sighing and panting) (gasping) (screams) - Did you start to feel ill during the night too? - Yes. - Hmm. And tell me, from which fountain do you collect your water? - The one behind the Nocera Gate. - The Nocera Gate, you say? (knocking at door) Who is it? - [Woman] I apologize for disturbing you doctor but-- - What? - Come please. They all need to be examined. - [Doctor] I'm sure, Cornelius. First the old olive tree that died, then the flock of sheep, now dozens of poisoned people. There's only one possible explanation. The water must be poisoned. - [Marcus] Cuspius. Father, do you feel unwell? - [Cornelius] Oh I'm fine, it's the water that is ill. - Sulfur. - [Cornelius] It's been like that for two days. - [Doctor] The problem must be along the largest aqueduct. - I agree with that. - We'll have to check it inch by inch. - I have to go back. There will be other people who feel unwell. Try and solve the problem before there's a widespread panic. Father, show me the map of the water mains. (dramatic music) Wait a minute. Valeria. - What is it? - I don't believe this. Look. You see? This is what Quintus' map refers to. It's the water mains in Pompeii. - [Valeria] I see. - We will come back soon. - [Cornelius] Be careful. - We're nearly there. This. This is the point marked on the map. But why? (footsteps echoing) Look. - Valeria, what is it? [Valeria] Look, up there. - [Marcus] I'll go look, hold the torch. Hand it to me. Be careful, be careful! Ow. Where are we? (dramatic music) (moaning) - I love you. I love you. - I have to go. - I don't want it. (coins clatter) - (scoffs) Why? You did a good job. - You're so stupid. - How dare you? - Have you not yet noticed that I truly love you? (scoffs) - If you want me to pay for your freedom, just speak up clearly. Don't tease me. - You don't understand do you? Perhaps because no one's ever loved you before me. (laughs) - And I am the one who is stupid? This is the last time we meet. (sighs) (orchestral music) (gasping) - These are the ownership deeds. This is the old land registry for Pompeii. - The one buried by the great earthquake. But why is it so important? What are you looking for? - Was it not after the great earthquake that Caledonius reclaimed your family home? - Yes. I thought my father owned it, but he showed me a deed proving that he owned the house. - The deed the governor showed you was false. This is the original. And this proves you were right, the house your family lived in belonged to your father, not to Caledonius. This land registry is proof of a colossal fraud. It's very simple. The land registry was buried by the earthquake, so they-- - They organized a new archive. - Exactly. But using fake documents, they registered the homes and the land belonging to those who died in their own names. - Vultures. - Not just vultures, assassins. When Quintus found out, they killed him. - But they didn't know he had drawn a map of how to get to the old land registry. - So we know why Quintus was killed. To clear your brother, we just have to discover who killed him. - You two think that Caledonius is the man behind all this, don't you? - Who profited from the earthquake? Caledonius. - What are you going to do? - I will discuss it with Tiberius. He will know how to trap Caledonius. - I have to go before the foremen wake up. - Please be careful in there. - And you be careful out there. (orchestral music) - And I can prove it, look. And these are only a few of the authentic documents in the old land registry. - To be sure of what you are saying, we must compare them to the ones in the new land registry. - Get dressed and let's go. - What did I tell you? They're all forgeries. As soon as Titus arrives, I will inform him personally. - The picture is complete now. Quintus discovered the fraud. The forgers discovered he found out and-- - And they killed him. - No, wait. - What's the matter? - If they killed Quintus because he discovered the fraud, why didn't they destroy the old archives? When I showed the map to Caledonius and to the judge, they could have requisitioned it and destroyed it. But they didn't take any notice, as if they didn't know that Quintus had discovered the ancient land registry. Maybe Quintus wasn't assassinated to hide the fraud. Perhaps he was killed for a different reason. - Don't confuse matters. It's a simple story. All we have to do is wait for Titus to arrive. (footsteps echoing) - [Caledonius] What are you doing here? - What do you think I'm doing, hmm? - But I had this tub built for Titus. - Perhaps he would prefer a tub with me in it, rather than an empty one. - This is the Emperor we're discussing, Lavinia. Not one of the many senators you've entertained in your bed. - Oh, so that's the problem, you're jealous. (Lavinia laughing) - I'm not jealous. - You're jealous. - That is not the point. The point is that you are drunk. How many times have I told you? - Oh please, don't preach to me. Or I will simply allow myself to drown. [Caledonius] Get out, get out of here! Get out! Lavinia get out! (Lavinia laughing) Come on, get out. Get out, Lavinia! (Lavinia laughing) - [Lavinia] Oh please, stop it. (laughing) - I never want to see you again in this part of the villa. This is the area reserved for Titus. (laughing) - Why do you worry so much? (laughing) You're only waiting for him to arrive so you can kill him. - Shut up, shut up! (dramatic music) Be quiet, be quiet. Someone will hear you. - You are the one who let Quintus overhear you. You and that idiot Meleagris, and because of that, you had to kill him. - What do you think, hm? (Lavinia gasps) Do you think I'm incapable of killing you too? - Do it. - Come on. (Lavinia laughs) Come on! Come on! - Wait! - What is it? - My wine. - [Caledonius] Come on! - [Guard] And where do you think you're going? - I need more water to finish over there. - Fulvius is the one responsible for the water. Send him. - He's busy, let me go. I'll return immediately. - Send the boy. - Fulvius, I need you to fetch me some water. - More water? But I just brought you some. - There's something very important I need you to do. Go to Marcus at the cistern, and tell him that I heard Caledonius and Lavinia speak. They argued, and I heard Lavinia say that Caledonius wants to kill the Emperor. This is a secret between me, you, and Marcus. Don't tell anyone else, promise. - Promise. - Now go, and be careful. - [Guard] Go. - The water. There's no water anymore. - What happened? - The water just stopped. - How should one behave in the presence of an Emperor? - (laughs) The first thing you need to know is that the Emperor is becoming deaf. - [Both] Huh? - Deaf. - [Both] Huh? - He's going deaf! - Oh! - Let me hear you speak as if you were addressing him. - Salve, salve Titus! - Louder. - Salve, salve Titus Flavius, son of the divine Vespasian! - Huh? - No, no, no, no, please no. It's better that you try together. - [Both] Salve, salve-- - Titus Flavius. - Valerius, Flavius. - [Both] Son of the divine Vespasian! - Yes, right, good! - [Caledonius] Stop it, Meleagris. - You prepare the villa for Titus, and I'll take care of the peasants. (laughing) - Can't you even take anything seriously? - Find me something worthwhile. (laughing) - [Tiberius] Caledonius. - Oh, Tiberius. - I need to speak to you. - Come on. Follow me. Over here. - You slippery worm, we have discovered your damned fraud. - What, what do you mean? - The documents in the new land registry, that's what I mean. Quintus' map leads to the old land registry. - Pompeii is my territory, and you are not better than I am. Since you were here to assassinate the Emperor. - No, I'm not like you. I do not want to kill Titus to become wealthier, I want to see him dead because it's the only way to remove vermin like you from Rome, and rid her from corruption. - You are deceiving yourself. - We shall see. But now we have a problem, Marcus suspects Quintus was not killed because of the map, and he will interfere with our plans. - There are too many people here. Let's go out. - Water! - We need water! - Water, water! - Please, calm down. Please calm down! - We need water! - Please calm down! Calm down, please calm down! Calm down, please! My father and I will explore the mains to discover where the blockage is. In a few hours the problem will be solved. - [Man] You always want to do things your way! - Fulvius what are you doing here? - Valeria has to talk to you, she has to talk to you. - Tiberius! Tiberius, hurry up, it's important! Tiberius! - Marcus, I was on my way out. Come with me. - I must talk to you now, it's important. I was right Tiberius, I was right. Quintus was not killed because he had discovered the fraud involving the land registry. - Yes, perhaps. But Marcus, really, I don't have time now. I can't stay here and listen to you. - But you must listen to me, because I-- - You can talk to me on the way. - They intend to kill Titus. They want to kill the Emperor. They will kill him here in Pompeii. Caledonius is behind all this. Valeria discovered the plot. She overheard Lavinia quarreling with Caledonius and they said that-- - It's true. My wife and I really do talk far too much. - You too? You are on his side? - Who would ever suspect him? That is why he is the perfect killer. Luck is on our side, Tiberius. We had no idea how to control Marcus, and he himself has solved the problem for us. All we have to do now is kill him. You deal with him. I will deal with Valeria. - Guards! Disarm him. - [Guard] Let's go down. - [Tiberius] Chain him up. - How? How did you come to this? You were loyal to Rome and to the Emperor. - I am loyal to Rome, you can't understand. - Try and explain it to me. - Go. Leave me alone with him. (Marcus grunting) You have seen what's happened to Rome. The city's full of corrupted, ambitious and ruthless men. Titus promised to soldiers, he promised us that he would be just if he became Emperor, and we trusted him. We supported him. But as soon as he came to power, he became like all the others. We need to get rid of him, and restore Rome to what she was when we were ready to die to defend her. - And you side with Caledonius, the most corrupt of them all? - Caledonius is only an instrument, and once we have got rid of Titus-- - What will you do? Will you kill him too? You told me that I changed. No. You are the one that has changed, Tiberius. Not me. - If you had seen what I saw during these years, you would understand and be at my side again, like when you saved my life. - You were my friend then. - I still am, Marcus. That's why I will not kill you. (Marcus grunts) You will be my prisoner until I have finished what needs to be done. I'm sorry. - What about Valeria? (door slams) What about Valeria? What about Valeria? - Marcus' life depends on you now. (sighing) (grunting) - (crying out) I can't! I can't. (slap resounding) (crying out) - You. You forced me to do that. - No. No, no! - What are you doing? Let her go. - [Caledonius] Go away, don't interfere. (Caledonius grunting) (slap resounding) (crying out) - I said let her go, stop! (squelching) (grunting) (gasping and sobbing) (grunting) - Marcus. He's in the house. In my house. (Tiberius coughing) Tell him. Tell him I have not changed. - Tiberius. (somber music) - Hey Cuspius, doctor. You must be very thirsty. (laughing) - Don't be facetious, it's for my patients. All I do is go back and forth from the river to my house. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, let me help you. (grunting) I hope Cornelius solves this problem quickly. I have no idea what will happen here. - (laughing) It's easy. We'll quench our thirst with your wine. (laughing) - Yeah, and then perhaps-- (rumbling) (exclaiming) (crashing) What... (exclaiming) (crashing) - [Man] Over there, in the alley! (exclaiming) (crashing) (dramatic music) (rumbling) (dog barking) (dramatic music) (rumbling) - [Valeria] Let me go. - You had a choice, now it's too late. - No. (Caledonius grunts) (blow thudding) (grunting) (exclaiming) (rumbling) - Is it over? - Is it over? - I think so. - Look at that. - The fountain. - It's water. - The water's back. - The water's working. - It's water. - The water's back. - Water, water. - We have water! - We have water! - Water! - The water's back. - Let me get in there. - Water. - I need some water. - Let me get in. - Oh, more water. - The water's back. (rumbling) (gasping) (rumbling) (dramatic music) (rumbling) (yelling) (orchestral music) (rumbling) (bird cawing) (orchestral music) (rumbling) - The mountain. (orchestral music) (rumbling) - By all the gods. Officer! - Yes, Admiral. - Prepare the ships, we set sail immediately. - Where to, Admiral? - Pompeii. - Pompeii, why? - There are a few things I've not seen in my life. This is one of them. (orchestral music) - The mountain is spitting out hell. - This is what hit you. - It's light. It didn't hurt me at all. - Right, hot and light. - What is it? - What's going on? - What is it? (exclaiming) - [Man] Hurry, save yourselves, hurry. (exclaiming) (rumbling) (Caledonius groans) - Caledonius. What on Earth? - What is all this noise? Hmm? - It is... It is... the stones. - Stones, what stones? - From the sky. - Stones from the sky? Have this body hidden. There's something I must finish. - Caledonius. I... I am... I'm afraid. - [Woman] Come on, come and see, it's raining stones from the sky, come. - It's raining? It's better to stay indoors, is it not? - [Woman] Look it's true, aren't you curious to see what's happening? - That is enough of this nonsense. Come on, I paid you for other services. - Father, mother! Ausia said you would not come back, but I knew you would. - Would you like to play a game? - [Child] Yes! - Good girls, this is the game. Take these pillows and put them on your heads. - Like hats? - Like hats, brilliant. Take my hand and stay close to me, all right? - What's going on? - I don't know, I only know - All right. - that we must leave Pompeii immediately, leave everything and come with us! - Yes. - [Child] Quickly. - What's happening? (exclaiming) - Marcus, where are you? - [Marcus] Valeria! Valeria! - Marcus! - I'm here, down here! Down here! Valeria, I'm down here! - Marcus. - [Marcus] Valeria, how did you manage to escape? - It was Tiberius. He stopped Caledonius, and then there was an earthquake and I managed to get away. - Where is Tiberius now? - He's dead. He died to save me, Caledonius killed him. Before dying he said, "Tell Marcus I've not changed." (orchestral music) I'm sorry. (crashing) - We must get out of here. - What about the chains? (coughing) - You must break them. - How? - Find a sword. Maybe mine is still upstairs. Look for it, with my clothes. - All right I'll go look for it. - Hurry! - I found it. - Hurry! Hurry! - I'm here. - [Marcus] A good strong blow. We have no choice. Be brave. (clanging) (grunting) Be brave. (clanging) (grunting) (chain clattering) - Who ordered you to stop working, who? Did I give an order? No. Well, out you go. I'm not interested in what is happening, even if it should rain fire. Work must be completed. Go back out there. Go back out there! Return to work or I will kill you myself, one after the other. Out! Come on, out! Go on, out! And remove all that stuff from the garden. You see, there's no reason to stop working. You two are no use to me here. Go and find Valeria Drusilla for me, and bring here back here, alive! - [Slave] Yes sir! Let's go. - Don't run away, cowards. Return to you posts if all of you don't want to face a court martial. - Shall we try to be reasonable men? Go. You remember me? - I'm sorry. - Get out of here. - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. - (coughing) Annuis, Annuis! - [Annius] Valeria! Am I already dead? - No, but if you don't hurry... It's no longer raining stones. We must free my wife and all of the others. - Hurry before it starts again. - [Valeria] (whimpering) Marcus! - [Guard] Stop there! - Help me. - Valeria! (thudding) I would turn around if I were you. (laughing) (thudding) (grunting) - As the saying goes, help yourself and the heavens will help you. (crashing) (Valeria gasping) - [Marcus] Yes, but this is too much. (crowd screaming) (explosions booming) (screaming) (yelling) - [Annisius] Publius, come here, come with me. (coughing) - What do you want to do? Abandon everything? - Prepare my things, I do not wish to die. - But leaving, it means dying. This house is our life. - Well stay then. I'm leaving. I'm leaving! (orchestral music) (rumbling) - What are you doing? Just standing here. You must must prop the ceilings. Are you waiting for them to collapse one by one? Follow me. Follow me. Come with me. Follow me, follow me, follow me! (screaming) My back. - Go, go, go. (groaning) - My back. I can't move. I can't move. (groaning) Help me. Help me! My back! My back! My back! - Aulis, come with us, hurry! - Don't leave, help me. - I can't. - But-- - I can't. I must help him. - But the whole building is about to collapse, come on. - [Master Of House] Help me. - Aulis! (yelling) - Here, here I am. Don't worry, don't worry. - Help me. - I order you to get me away from here. Damn you. You know me, Aulis. - Don't be afraid. We'll both be out of here, very soon. (moaning) (yelling) - The house collapsed. Why did he do it? Why? - He obeyed the laws of his God. - And the law of his heart. (rumbling) - [Slave] Master! Master! - Where is the girl? - She escaped. - You are hopeless. I have to do everything myself. Keep an eye on them for me. Now they have all calmed down. (slave groaning) (orchestral music) - [Slave] Fluvius. (thudding) (slave gasps) (Lavinia crying and gasping) (projectile whistling) (crashing) - [Slave] Lavinia! Lavinia! - What are you doing here? - Do you believe me now when I say that I love you? Get up and come away with me. - Away? - We must escape from Pompeii. (explosion booming) (screaming) Come on. Come on, come on. - It's stopped. - But we don't know whether it might happen again. We must take refuge in the water mains. They lead to the shore. It's the only safe place there is. - We have to tell everyone to go to the cistern. - Let's split up. You take care of the others, and I'll go and look for my wife and the other slaves. - We'll meet at the cistern at my father's place. (explosions booming) (dramatic music) - Where am I going? Where on Earth am I going? What am I doing? Stop! I said stop! - [Slave] Yes sir. - I'm going back to Pompeii. - Do as he says. (sobbing) No! No, no no, there's no need for you. There's no need for you to carry me. I'm in a hurry. I'm in a hurry. I'm in a hurry, I'm in a hurry! I'm in a hurry! (speaks faintly) - Come on. (groaning) (wordless vocal music) (groaning) There's someone here. There's a child, there's a child down here. Oh! (groaning) Help me. Dig him out. Yeah. - [Valeria] Careful. - [Marcus] Here you go, I've got you. (laughing) (orchestral music) - [Man] Hey, we're over here! We're over here, help us! - Pick us up! - Help us! - Over here, help us! (exclaiming) - The Admiral Polinius is here, they're coming to save us. - Come get us! - This way, hurry. - [Man] Somebody please, help us! - You have done very well so far. - They're coming to help. - If you carry on like this you will, you will win a prize. - What prize? - A journey on a very, very big ship. (laughing) But you must do what your nanny tells you, all right? - And where are you going, Father? - Father has to leave now. He has to do something very important. But we will come together again, very soon, all right? - [Woman] Please come. - Get on board of those ships when they land. - All right. - It is the only way to safety. - I will. What about you, Doctor? - I must return to the city. There will be many, many injured people who need me. - Good luck, Doctor. - Take care of the girls and of yourself. - Okay. - Come on. - Okay. - [Woman] Over here, here, this way! - Father, Father! Father! (crying) - Help, please. - Please come. - Please. - Don't worry people, we're coming. We are coming. - Admiral. - I'm listening. - We've lost another ship. One of the stones opened a hole in the hull and there was nothing more we could do. Admiral-- - My answer is no. I know how dangerous it is to bring the fleet in close to the coast. But that is what we will do, because we're the only hope there is for all those people. (explosion booming) - Admiral, even if we manage to reach the coast, we will never be able to leave again. Admiral we will suffocate and so will they. - Admiral Polinius, please. (orchestral music) (laughing) - Come on. Thank you. - Thank you. (explosion booming) That black cloud is swallowing everything up. - Everyone to the cistern now, now! Tell everyone you meet. The water mains might protect us. - If they collapse, if they collapse we will all be buried. - Yes that may happen, but we can't stay here. - Publius! Where are you, Publius? It's Annisius, where are you? Publius, Publius! Publius! Where are you, Publius? (sobbing) Publius, Publius. Let's leave, Publius. - What are you doing here? - I had forgotten something. My brother. (sobbing) Let's leave, Publius. They're all fleeing to the cistern to take refuge, water mains. - The mains? - Yes. - My cupboard is safer. - It can come with you if you want to. - The cupboard stays here. It's all right. Let's go. - Let's leave. Let's leave. (thudding) - Open the door, I'm still here. Open the door. Open the door! Open the... Open the door! Open the door! I can't die like this! I have something worth... worth living... worth living for. (wheezing) (groaning) - Attica? Attica! Attica. Where are you, Attica? Attica! Attica. (crying) I'm here now. Calm down, calm down. I'm right here. (fire roaring) (dramatic music) (rumbling) (sword clanking) - [Marcus] Hurry, inside! (rumbling) (orchestral music) - [Valeria] Annius, Attica. - [Attica] Valeria! - [Valeria] Attica how are you feeling? - [Attica] I think I'm all right. - Father. (yelling and screaming) (stones thudding) (volcano rumbling) (crashing) (yelling and screaming) (dog whines) Here it comes. Here it comes. (dog whining) (yelling and screaming) (panting) (moaning) (rumbling) (coughing) (wind roaring) - They held. (rumbling) The mains held. (rumbling) (yelling) (coughing) - [Marcus] Come on, we must go now. From here. It will take us to the shore. Come on, quick! Let's go, come on. Give me your hand, I'll help you. (dog whining) - [Cornelius] I'm coming. (orchestral music) (water splashing) - Look. This is the old land registry. The tremors have caused it to sink even deeper. - The documents will be lost. - Perhaps not. (Valeria screams) - What a moving scene. United together against the bad duumvir. But you needed this bad duumvir when you had to rebuild the city, didn't you? When things had to be done quickly without worrying too much about formalities, when it was necessary for Pompeii to rise from its ashes, before Rome forgot all about us. And I did it. No one will ever forget my Pompeii. And you will not stop me. You will be ash when I walk through the streets of my new Pompeii. (dog barks) (weapons clanging) (exclaiming) Death to me, life to you. This is Rome. - I know a different Rome. A Rome that does not respond with death to death. (exclaiming) Everyone out! Out, out! Out! (dog growling) (Caledonius grunting) (rumbling) (orchestral music) (wordless vocal music) - Ausia! Lieuca! (woman sobbing) Ausia! Lieuca. Ausia. (orchestral music) No! (sobbing) Oh my god! Why? Why? - What happened? What happened? - [Cuspio] Oh, my god. - Come Father, come. (sobbing) (wordless vocal music) (sobbing) (screaming) - Attica, what's wrong? - The baby! (screaming) - Sh, sh, sh. Cuspius! Cuspius! (screaming) Cuspius! Cuspius! It's all right. - Just breathe. - It's all right. - [Woman] Breathe normally. - Cuspius! - It's all right. - Cuspius! - Just calm down. - Help us! - [Annius] Help us, the baby's coming. - [Valeria] You're fine, we're here. (Attica screaming) - Over there. (Attica gasping) (orchestral music) (Attica screaming) (wordless vocal music) (sobbing) (orchestral music) (baby crying) (laughing) (orchestral music) (horse neighing) - Marcus. We always say that Rome is eternal. But all it takes is one day, and this is all that remains of one of the empire's most beautiful cities. - You are right, my Emperor. Rome is not eternal. Nor is she perfect. But there is, in Rome, a dream that deserves to last. It is up to you Titus, to make sure that dream does not die. (dramatic music) - [Valeria] Marcus.
