Hello? Excuse me... Christian Fischer, of Engel & Sons Real Estate. There seems to be a lot of vacant property around here. I wonder if the owners might be interested in selling. Excuse me. if youcame down for a minute I wouldn't have to talk so loud. Youknow, I talk all day. Can youtell me who owns this place? I don't think anyone wants to sell anything around here. Well, younever know. I could imagine... How much can youpay? That's hard to say without further inspection. It sure isn't worth m uch, unfortunately. The buildings are totally run down. But the surroundings are marvellous. The meadows, the fields. Something very nice can be made of this place. You came all the way here just for this? Everybody's got to make a living, right? The owners aren't around right now. And where are they? In the field, fucking a pig. You can wait for them if you like. Do you mind if I look around? Can you give me a hand? Where? Got one for me? Are you even old enough to smoke? Light? Fucking thing. Without me it would be on the scrap heap. Yougot a girlfriend? Is that any of your business? I've slept with every woman in town. Not bad. Can I try the radio? Go ahead. It's not my car anyway... You don't get many visitors here, do you? We keep to ourselves. The fields look deserted to me. It doesn't look like anyone is coming. You live here all by yourseif, don't you? Not bad! Yes? Are you on your way home? I think so. Did something happen? What? I don't know. What do you mean? You forget something? The picture. The picture of my girlfriend. Don't remember where I put it... Is it important? Yes. What does your girlfriend think about you being here? Come on, give me the picture. It's good. The women take care of my meals. Those women you slept with? I'll be the father of their children. And for that you get room service? You have a good life, you know that? What happened? Nothing. Looks bad. You'd better go now. Why? I don't think my people will be happy if you're here tomorrow. Have you ever been somewhere else? Than here? When I was little... I ran away for three days. Wanted to see the other villages. Didn't think much about it. My people went crazy. Must have thought I'd never come back. And to make sure that didn't happen again, they put me under arrest. Good morning!
