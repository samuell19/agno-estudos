We would like to implant a chip in you. Is it painful when it goes in? Right, local anesthetic. Scalpel. This is the injector. I'm Derren Brown. For the last 20 years in the UK, on the television and stage, I've performed as a psychological illusionist. I based a 20 year career on essentially two skills, firstly, the ability to pluck a thought from your head, secondly, the ability to get one into your head and that’s what we’ll do now. I use a combination of magic techniques, suggestion and psychology to explore the stranger edges of human experience. Whatever it takes, do it. Now, in these aggressively divided times, when we so readily define ourselves by our tribal identities, I want to try and create a hero. Someone who will willingly lay down their life and take a bullet, not for a loved one, but for a complete stranger. To put your life on the line, not just for a stranger, but for someone you don't identify with, requires two traits. To be fearless, and to have empathy. So for this to work I need to create those qualities in my hero. Everything you will see is 100% real. I genuinely have no idea how this plays out or if the experiment will be successful. First though, I have to find my candidate. I shortlisted 100 people out of the thousands who responded to an ad looking for participants for a TV experiment. Hello, thank you very much for coming. Erm... I brought this hundred to a daylong audition and interviewed them on a broad range of subjects hoping to find someone with a strong bias against another group. And one man quickly caught my attention. There is absolutely an immigration problem in the United States. You think, "You're not even supposed to be here, why should we follow your religious beliefs?" Phil is a 33-year-old city maintenance worker from Cocoa Beach, Florida, married with two young children and a third on the way. Raising a family is tough and much of Phil's frustration is directed at illegal immigrants whom he sees as being favoured over his family. Just still getting a lot of immigrants through, not working, can't work because they're illegal. Am I personally scared of them? No. But I'm certainly scared that they could turn our country to shit. I say kick 'em out, I say kick 'em all out. It's these strongly held views that make Phil the perfect subject for this experiment I want to undertake. Phil believes he's taking part in a documentary. Showing how cutting edge biotechnology can bring dramatic improvements to your life. We’ll place electrodes on the base of your index finger and the middle finger. In fact, he is the unsuspecting star at the center of an elaborate psychological experiment filmed across two continents, based entirely around him and his beliefs. As Phil has no idea what he's taking part in, to make this work, I have to create a completely convincing fictional world around him. I wanna hear him, I want him to hear the same things from your mouth, yeah. I'm using a specialist crew of over a hundred people in the UK - and USA... - That's perfect position. ...pro divers, special effects supervisors, and stunt teams. I'm planning scenarios using professional actors, which need meticulous rehearsals. Tell us, you're not threatening with the gun now, you've made that decision. And I have multiple hidden cameras to secretly watch all the action unfold. And I've designed all of this to try and create a huge personal change in Phil and radically transform his most strongly felt opinions. In a way, I've always kind of been more biased towards white people, but again I'm not racist. That’s just how I was brought up. I hope to show Phil the amazing things we’re capable of when we let go of the stories that we think define us. This won't be easy, but by the end of this journey, I hope to have him willingly take a bullet for someone he thinks is an illegal immigrant. No! Phil has been told that his audition was successful, and has been chosen to take part in this documentary about biotechnology. He stays in London and we invite him to our production offices. - See, so this is er, Dr. Jeff. - Hi, Dr. Jeff. Phil. - Hi. - And this is Phil. Have a seat, Phil. And now I'm going to spin him a line about what exactly this experiment is going to involve. I developed, with the help of a bunch of scientists and people that you'll meet today, a piece of technology, which is about gaining a kind of control over one’s own life and decisions. This documentary is about beta testing that piece of technology, and you are one of six people chosen from yesterday who we will follow as you - beta test that technology. - Fantastic. - Does that make sense so far? - Yes, that makes sense so far. All right, good. So, the technology’s based around a microchip. OK. Um, so in order to do this and to put this into practice, we would like to implant a chip... ...in you. Can we show Phil the chip? It's a small bio glass tube. Okay, so we’re not really putting a microchip into Phil, but I need him to think we are, it gives me a tool to work with, namely the placebo effect which is when a medical treatment works better just because we expect it to, and in some tests placebo has made a treatment twice as effective. So everything I now tell Phil about the chip is a lie. Now this... sits here, at the base of your brain by your pituitary gland, the chip stimulates your brain in to releasing adrenaline and dopamine, motivating you in to action. - All right, does that make sense? - Yes, that makes sense. Pretty amazing technology. Look, if you agree to do this, it could bring about radical improvements in your life, that’s the idea. I'm... - absolutely happy to do it. - You are? Yeah, absolutely. - Great. - Absolutely. So with Phil now thinking there's a chip in him, I moved on to explain that the chip is connected to an app. I'm just gonna pair the two things together. The app’s called Turbine. Turbine. It is a little like a meditation app so when we tell you to you sit down, you put headphones on and you listen to it, and it creates in you a powerful desire to act decisively, which is boosted by the chip in your neck. And as far as we know, we're the first people to do that so... - Very cool. - ...you're part of an exciting... That's very cool. So I sent Phil off to start using the app, but here’s how it really works. The app films him and uploads footage so I can make sure he keeps using it. Each time he listens to a recording of my voice... Feel the change in your body as you step forward. ...which gets him to tap into a decisive fearless state and then plays him the trigger. Feel how that changes. Over time, he’ll associate the trigger sound more and more with that feeling. Each time you do this, it gets more powerful, each time you hear that sound. This process is called classical conditioning. It's even more effective 'cause Phil believes he's an implanted microchip doing all the hard work for him. For him to take a bullet, I need the app trigger sound to instantly generate an active and fearless state in Phil. And crucially, I'll be able to play that trigger sound to him whenever I choose to bring about that decisive state of mind. All right, um... Just thought I'd do a quick entry. We asked Phil to keep us updated on how he's doing by recording some video diaries. This is crazy, I've never had anything like that done before, I've never been in surgery, I've never broken a bone, so, this kinda procedure is just absolutely crazy. But it wasn't a case of having to think about whether I was going to do it or not, 'cause I was going to do it. It's a little tender but erm... but just have to see what happens. Anyway, signing off. After a week or so of using the app, I'll test to see if it's working by bringing him to Carnforth in the north of England, and asking him to do something that will take extraordinary courage. Fucking hell man, this is too... it's too much. But first, I need to embed a second trigger to help remove something that stands in the way of heroism; the fear of pain. I'll need your phone er, if you have it. So I invite Phil back to our production offices, telling him we need to try something to help calibrate the app. So for this technique, I'll use special embedded language patterns to remove the experience of pain and attach that to a ritual physical action. This doesn't work with everyone, but I think Phil will be responsive. And the words you'll see on the screen will give you some idea of how the technique works. Put your hand on the table there for me, - and just look at the back of that hand. - Right. There. One of the reasons why I'm doing it in this room this is the same room that you had your er, implant put in. Right? So you'll associate this room with feelings of anesthesia, you had it in the back of your neck so you couldn't feel anything. But as you look at this, I want you to imagine, that you've had an anesthetic again, like you had in your neck, and that feeling, or lack of feeling, just starts to spread through the hand like a kind of blueness. All sensation drifting out of that hand, over there. Once I know he's in a responsive state, I give him his trigger, the fist bump. Bring it above your head, and you're gonna remove all last traces of sensation from that hand by bumping a couple of times on your head. Do that now. And that signal gets through to the hand, and now if you touch it, you'll find there's just nothing. What's it like? - Like a dead hand. - It's just... You know when your hand falls asl… That's what it feels like. Can't feel a thing. - Yeah. - Yeah. It is like someone else’s hand, isn't it, like a bit of dead meat. Other people say this. You could stick something through it you'd not-- It feels like a dead hand. Shall we do it now, are you prepared to do that now? Yeah, great. What you'll see next might look like magic, but it's the result of overwhelming his expectation of pain with the by now fully embedded belief that his hand is numb. Let me give you this. So if you hold this in your right hand. OK. I'm gonna pinch the skin here and here on that hand. OK. I'm pinching that skin, but you can feel nothing, right? - No. - All right. Don’t push the needle through yet, but just hold it near, maybe rest your hand so that you're supporting... that's good. About there, right, just press it gently against the skin. - All the way through? - Yeah, yeah. - Nothing. - Nothing. - Absolutely nothing. - Like pushing it through a steak. - D'you want me to go the whole way? - You wanna stop there. Let’s have a look. So, what's that like to look at? Very strange, no pain, no tenderness, - it just feels like nothing. - Yeah. - Just look at that for me. - OK. And as you look at the back of the hand, just know that you can bring this pain free state back by bumping your head in the same way whenever you need to. And this was the crazy part, this is why tonight has just been absolutely insane. He says, "I want you to remember the feeling of when you had the anesthetic put in your neck for the chip. Said "I want you to imagine that with your hand." He says, "OK, now go ahead and stick the needle through your skin." So, slowly I pierced the needle through my skin. And I could not... I could not feel any of it. Any of it. Erm... so that was pretty insane. Just have to wait and see what tomorrow brings, so goodnight. That was a really important discovery for Phil, he's experienced how subjective pain can be, and he's linked that state to the head bump, it's a very encouraging start. Now, though, I need to see if the conditioning from the app is working, so I've designed a test tailor-made around Phil’s phobias, to see if that trigger sound is enough to make him overcome the things he dreads the most. Some of the fears I have are kind of- some of them are irrational... Heights, deep water freaks me out, I don’t go in the ocean, I live in Florida, but I've never been in the ocean. I've brought Phil to a disused quarry, where my team have rigged a platform 50 feet above freezing cold water. Will the triggers be enough to make Phil jump? I know you really don't like heights, you also don’t like open water as well, right? I want to jump out of this wet suit and... and go back to the hotel. Okay. Well I'm just gonna show you something and we’ll do this step by step. We’ll take all the time we need. Just turn and face that way, oh, I need your phone for a second. So, if I asked you to walk as far as you could, how far would that be? Oh, fucking hell man. About there? OK. Cool, come back. So it's just past the edge of the grass. I just need to take your mic off. Just think for a moment the idea of walking to the edge. No further than that, just the edge. Not off the edge, just to the edge. Okay, I'm gonna play the app sound and I want you to notice what change this makes to your emotional state. Amazing. I'm standing behind you, just note what's different. Focus, and notice where that feeling of stability starts, right in the middle of it all. Take a few more steps if you wish. That's good. I think the biggest... leap of faith that we take is when we step out of our own stories, particularly the stories about what we’re capable of, like this for example. That is, I think the real... step... forward. - This is too much, yeah, Derren. - OK, it's OK. - I feel I've gotta jump. - Yeah. But something’s holding me back. That’s fine, there's two sides, there's two sides of you. It's too much. - Come off for a bit? - Please. Yeah? OK. Just come back. Something’s pushing me back. So what was it like, what were the... It's like a... it's like a fucking battle in my head, I got one strong feeling telling me to just fucking jump. And then I got another part of me saying "What the fuck are you doing - standing out here?" - Yeah. I really need Phil to do this. He’ll need to overcome an even more substantial fear when the time comes to make the sacrifice. It's a good day. Something’s holding me back. Something’s holding me back. - Everything up to jumping is all right, then I get fucking dizzy. - I don't think I can do it, Derren. - OK. - I don’t think I can. - Don’t have to. It is clearly not working. The triggers aren't overcoming his fears, and even though failure here throws the whole experiment in to doubt, I have no alternative but to call it off. Shall we go and get warm? - Can I have a minute up here, please? - Yeah, of course. I knew in the back of my mind that he might not jump. I'm so used though to people just following the tracks that I've laid down, er, so I, I don’t know at this point whether or not when it comes down to it, that he'll... step out in front of the gun and take a bullet which is... which is ultimately what all this is heading towards, so... I don’t know at this point. After that failure, I am wondering if perhaps I pushed Phil too quickly. So while I have him continue to work with the app every day... Feel the change in your body each time you hear that sound. I move on to step three of this conditioning process. For Phil to act heroically, it's not just about acting decisively and not just in the face of fear, but also acting out of empathy and placing another person’s life before his own. How Phil responds to the information I'm about to give him will be a vital clue as to how he’ll react when the time comes to take a bullet for someone who is very different from him. Where's your family from? Remind me. Okay my father’s side are all from the UK. And then my mother's side are all from Florida. When Phil first began this process, he went through several stages of screening, including phone and video calls with my team, when he was asked to express his opinions. The big issues is probably from, from Cuba and Mexico. This is not your fucking country, this is our country and you've come in and you're alienating your hosts, basically. There's places where it's that bad they’ve taken over that Americans aren’t actually... it's not suggested to actually go into these areas because it's unsafe. He also, like the other potential contributors, provided a DNA sample. I told him the DNA data was for his app, but really I'm hoping the results might help him re-evaluate his opinions, something that must happen if Phil is to sacrifice himself for a stranger and become a true hero. Er, so, as an American you may not be aware of this, the rest of the world. Do you remember at the start of all this - you did a cheek swab? - Yes, I do. So what we got from that with your DNA test results, which I have in here, specifically what we were looking at was your heritage and your entire genetic history. So in a sense, what's in this envelope, is the real you. That's incredible. These are set out according to the size - The percentage. - Yeah, exactly. - Top of the list is 22.9% - OK. From a region known as Fennoscandia, which is here. It's Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Norway. - Really. - Yeah. 13% of you, Western Siberia. - Si... Siberia? - Siberia, Russia. - That's insane. - Hmm. It would've never been anything that I would've considered other than... - British and American. - Yeah. As the percentages get smaller, the surprises keep coming. 3.4% of you from Israel and this region goes from Israel and moves into Syria. That's extremely interesting. And finally, just under 1%, 0.9%, er, Mexico. - Mexico? - Mhm. Mexico, down through Peru. - That's incredible. - Mhm. It's pretty shocking, in a good way. It's amazing to think over these tens of thousands of years how - people have moved around. - Shifted around. and that, that story, which has led to you sitting here, is from those, ancient tribes and groups just... - Moving around. - Just migrating and mixing and... What's the biggest shock there? I would have to say, - this one, the Israel, Syria. - Mhm. And of course, Mexico down through Peru. - Why's that? - Um... I think it's just how I... I maybe have perceived different areas of the world, and maybe not so much in a positive light. And I, you know, and not in any racist way, or... but you know when you're from somewhere it's easy to look at other places and not understand it and... make negative assumptions about it. Which I have done. Phil seems genuinely affected by these revelations. So I asked him to take part in another test right away. I tell him it's to recalibrate the app. But in fact, I'm hoping this will be a transformational experience. The experiment was developed by a New York psychology professor to provoke feelings of empathy. Pairs of complete strangers sit facing each other, and are asked to silently stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes. I hope that following the news about his DNA, staring into the eyes of someone from a different race will create intense emotions that I can anchor and use at the climax of this experiment. Are you all right? It was almost like looking into him, it was almost like looking into his soul. I just got this overwhelming feeling like I already knew him. Can I give you a hug, dude? Yeah, yeah sure. Come here, buddy. Everything I've ever thought of other people, the way I've been towards people, or... It was gone and I just... the whole time looking at him, I felt like I just wanted to give him a hug. It was overwhelming. The DNA results and staring test seemed to have had a profound effect on Phil and bringing back those heightened feelings of empathy will be a key component in the final experiment. Now though, it's time to tell him filming is finished and he can head home. - Hi. - Hey. Erm... so, - I've booked us a table for dinner. - Oh, fantastic. yeah, it’ll be nice, so it isn't quite goodbye, but... - we are done with you, that was-- - Wow, incredible. It's just been an absolute roller-coaster of emotions through this whole process. - Phil’s coming to say goodbye. - Goodbye, everyone. Erm, and it's been an experience that I can't even begin to explain, how much it's going to change me moving forward. Been great to meet you, have a safe journey. - Brother. - Brother. It's just been awesome. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Thank you, Derren. - So, goodnight. Phil has returned to his life in Florida, and we've given him enough time to forget all about me and the experiment, even though he didn't jump at the quarry, Phil’s empathic connection to a complete stranger, combined with his continued use of the app, means that I'm hopeful, the triggers I embedded, the belief in the chip, overcoming the fear of pain, and heightened levels of empathy, will be enough to make him act heroically. And I really hope this works, I want everyone to see what's possible if we can just get past the narrow constraints of the stories that we tell ourselves. This is where Phil will hopefully be taking a bullet and making the ultimate sacrifice, the middle of the desert, and we've come up with a ruse to get him here. We asked a friend of Phil’s to call him and say he'd won a trip to Vegas and that Phil could join him. So Phil has flown to LA to drive down to Vegas, he believes, to meet his friend. Now we have cameras in that car, the driver is one of us. How's the hotel? And Phil has no idea that this is being filmed, no idea that this is part of this TV project, and no idea that he's never gonna make it to Vegas. For the scenario we've planned for Phil, we've taken over a remote bar in the middle of nowhere, which we've populated with a biker gang played by actors, and spent the whole week adapting inside and out with carefully hidden cameras and microphones. So this is a fake wall that we've built and then behind it, if you come through, hopefully you can see, camera here, there’ll be another camera here. These are filming through these one-way mirrory things, and then we've got the same behind the bar, So these'll give us great shots from behind the bar, looking at them sat at the bar. So all the shots that we will see are perfectly hidden. He’ll have no idea that any of this is being filmed. - We had two days of really intense rain. - Did you? Like biblical. It's actually a very important line, er, "You're one of us now." So I think just make it land a bit more, put your hand on his shoulder and give it a moment, "You're one of us now." I tell the driver to say they're having car trouble to give them a reason to stop at the bar. Right, let’s go, time to hide. Here we go. They pull up for the driver to solve the supposed car issue and more importantly, to abandon Phil. - Everybody. - Let's go. Stay on the mark. - Something to drink? - Yeah, Diet Coke, please. I'll do a Diet Coke too, please. How many bars do you have on your phone? 4G. I'm not even on the one bar on 4G. - D'you mind if I borrow it? - No. Go ahead. Thanks, I'm just gonna call the office. Alright, cool. Alright. And he's given the driver his phone, the driver’s asked to take the phone so he can call and find a local mechanic. It's important as we need to get Phil’s phone out of the equation. Okay, Martin, go wider. For this to work, I need Phil to feel alone and cut off because I want him to form a bond with the biker gang. OK, John, go to the bar. Cue John. Anybody need any more? Gonna grab some more. Hey Kelly, can I get one more? Yeah, yeah, please. - What you riding? - Er, I'm actually... I'm in a car with somebody. Driving from LA to Vegas. - Oh sweet. Very cool. - Yeah we've had some car problems - and he's taken it to go get fixed. - That sucks. Where you from? - I live in Cocoa Beach, Florida. - Cocoa Beach? What are you doing? Erm, I work in, work for the city of Cocoa Beach. - What do you do, are you a cop, or... - No, public works. Made me nervous then, said "Oh are you a cop?" - Hi, well, we’re gonna roll out now. - No, no, definitely not a cop. - What's your name again? - I'm John, how are you? - Phil, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, John. It's going well, so the idea here is to create a connection with one of the bikers, a rapport that’s crucial for the next stage to work. What are you drinking? Er, just soda, but now, I'm thinking about maybe getting a beer. You're gonna start tearing it up in Vegas, kinda pacing yourself? Yeah, definitely. - Call him now? - Yeah. Right, and we ended up on the same team again, so I kinda thought... - Well, it's fate. - It's fate, sure. Erm, but when we first met, er, yeah... - Are you Phil? - Yes. You have a phone call. Hello? Hey Phil, it's Jason. How you doin', man? - Hey Jason. - Hey good. I'm at the mechanic, I don't think it's gonna take very long, but I can't leave the car er, and I can't like come and get you with it because it's not working very well insurance purposes, all that kinda stuff, I need you to get a cab and come down here. Erm, it's called Edgeley Garage, it's about two and a half miles from the bar. D'you mind doing that? Do you, sorry, do you know Edgeley Garage? It's, yeah, down near... four or five miles. Erm, is there any way I could get a cab here? Alright, Phil, the mechanic is calling, I gotta let you go. - All right, man, talk to you soon. Bye. - Bye. Erm, are there cabs out here? Yeah that’s why I was laughing, I'm sorry, didn’t mean to be rude, but... Why, what do you need? I guess the car’s at Edgeley Garage. He's saying it's about two and a half miles, but he can't leave the truck. Dude, we can give you a ride. We can give you a ride. We just got the truck here. Just right down the road, it's where we get our bikes taken care of. If that's OK with you, it's up to you. Yeah, yeah that's fine. It's a pretty straight shot, there's nothing out here. Like, it's completely just desert. So, enjoy the view... So with Phil settling in and having agreed to take a ride from the bikers, it's time for us to create some conflict. Cue Pablo and Carlos, start heading to the bar. and things are going to turn a little nasty. This is Phil’s first test, I'm hoping he’ll empathise with them and at least speak up in their defense. Plan, that was the original plan. And it just, it just never happened. Chico. Man. You guys can't drink here. Why not? Certain rules, you can't drink. - You gotta go. - Alright, okay. - OK? - You know, let's go. - OK? - Don't, don't touch me. Come on. All right! Chill! What the fuck... - Hey, fuck you! - Get the fuck outta here. Fucker! You OK, Rick? Can we get some beers over here? - Sorry about that. - Yeah. Yeah, so, that was the plan. Never panned out, hopefully one day. Once again, sorry about that, are we good? Sometimes we get Mexicans come in here and... fuckin' pisses us a lot of us, all about God, country, and fucking... you know. OK, Phil’s clearly feeling conflict, but he hasn’t been bold enough to speak up, which is a bit of a worry. Now give me a second. Hey Chip... Still, that conflict is important. So the next thing is er, the biker is going to give Phil one of their jackets. This is important because Phil needs to be made to feel like he's one of them, one of the club, which is gonna enhance this conflict that he's already feeling. Cue the jacket. Try this on. I feel really bad about what happened, try this on. The jacket’s also important for a technical reason later on. Check him out. Hey guys, this is Phil. It's like it was made for you, brother. You guys don't have to do that. - I really want you to have that, man. - I appreciate it. - Yeah. Woo! - Look at that! I appreciate that. Thank you. - Now you're one of us man, so... - Thank you, guys. Thank you. Phil has now accepted a place in this gang. In many ways, they reflect the views he held when I first met him. I know, Phil now you can take your wife home a souvenir. - Yeah. - That you met some decent people out here. Yes. Absolutely. Appreciate it, guys, thank you. D'you wanna get going? - Yeah. - I feel bad I'm keeping you. No, I didn’t know if you wanted to finish your beer. I'm good, we'll get you on the road. The question now, is will the triggers and conditioning help him reject those values and feel compassion when it matters most. While they re-position the cameras, that is my cue to go to my hidey-hole. The camera will be filming from this truck. I'll hide in here with them. - Thanks, guys. - You all be good. Thank you very much, guys, really appreciate it. - Bad, bad, boy. - Thanks. So, like I said, we take all our bikes there, he's pretty good. - Pretty quick, so... - Good. You hop in the front man, I'll hop in the back. Those bikes look knocked over, dude. Hey! Get the guys. Come in our fucking bar, you mess with our bikes. - Dude, they knocked over your bike, man! - Jesus Christ! Go, go, go! Fuck this shit, man. Let's rock it, Mexicans. The biker gang now begin the chase, my stunt team have choreographed. What sounds like a radio station in the truck is being controlled remotely by me and it will soon play a crucial role. There's nowhere to go. Got 'em now, they're fenced in, they're trapped. What's about to unfold will be extreme and frightening and it will take enormous courage for Phil to intervene. No exit out here, so good luck with this shit. At the climactic moment, I will trigger the app sound, which I've embedded in the jingle of a fake radio broadcast. Phil, stay in the truck it's nothing to do with you. This should produce a rush of adrenaline and then it's all down to Phil. Fuck you going? Where the fuck are you going? Fuck you, man. What the fuck is he doing? Come in our fucking bar, you mess with our bikes. We just wanted our drink. That’s the American flag man, you don’t belong here. But yeah, you come into our fucking country, come into our fucking bar. You guys are fucking illegal, you come across the border, you rape and pillage our people, fuck you, man. Then you fuck with our bikes, you think you'll walk outta here? Alright, we’re sorry, man. Okay? Are you fucking legal here? This is our country, man. - Shut the fuck up. - You know what, just let us go. Why would we let you go? - I'm sorry, we fucked up, okay? - You definitely fucked up. - Are you legal here? - Yeah, we are, man. Really? Show us your papers. I mean, I don’t carry that. - You don’t have 'em? - I have my driving licence man. ...warmest weather in all of america with a constant... Tell me the truth. Shut the fuck up! He says anything else, nail him. You, are you legal? Are you legal? - Answer him! - We're not, man. Fuck 'em. Fuck it, Rick. No, no, no. No, no, no! - You're listening to KXDV on... - What the fuck? ...the sound of San Bernandino... I trigger the app sound in our radio broadcast. There's absolutely an immigration problem. I say kick 'em all out. I feel like I have to jump... ...like a dead hand... I have a family. I have a daughter and I have a son. Hey, Phil, this has nothing to do with you. Phil. Rick, Rick, Rick, man. Get back in the truck. This has nothing to do with you. Phil, this has nothing to do with you. This ain't right. I'm serious, get in the fucking truck. You're gonna get hurt. Can we not just call the police? Please call the police. Fuck that, fuck this shit, fuck it. I can't watch this, man. I've never... please. Dude, Phil, we’ll take care of this, alright? We got this shit. - Please, I'm begging you. - We are not calling the police. - Please, I'm begging you guys. - Phil, I got one bullet in this gun. It's gonna be you or him. Who’s it gonna be? Who’s it gonna be? - Please, Rick. Please. - Five. Rick, please stop counting, I'm begging you, man. Four. - Rick. Please. Rick, please man, come on!! - Three. Rick, you cannot do this. Guys, you can't do this. Two. - You cannot do this, please stop counting. - One. - Please stop counting. - Damn it. No! No! What the fuck? What the fuck? The fuck? What the fuck! - Phil. - What the fuck! It's Derren. You're in shock, it's okay, you're fine, it's just a special effect. It's OK, it's a squib. - It's not real blood. - What the fuck! Up you get. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. This whole thing... was about... ...who we are, ...and what we are capable of when we rid ourselves of those stories, and what you've just done... is the single most heroic and extraordinary thing that any human being can do for another human being. Also, Phil... there was no other participants in this show, right, it was just you. This was all just you. And you don't have a microchip implanted in you. You did all this on your own. I'm so proud of you. Well done. - We'll get you washed up. - Let's go. Thank you, man. I fucking thought I was dead there. - You okay, brother? - Can I call my fucking wife? You don't need to call her. - I love you. - I love you. I'll show you the cameras. That was absolutely intense. The whole situation up to getting in the biker bar and... and getting in this truck with people I didn’t know was terrifying, but as I'm sitting in the truck, something pushed me to get out of the truck, and it was like a surge of energy to get out of the truck. It was adrenaline, because I couldn't, sit in the truck and watch it. I just couldn't watch it. So something pushed me to get up out of the truck, grab the handle, open the door, and walk in front and at least try to stop whatever was happening. - I'm begging you, Rick, please! - Five. I did it 'cause I wanted to help. The stories we tell ourselves dictate the corners we fight from. One story tells us to protect our group and guard against outside threat, even at the expense of the disadvantaged. The opposite story tells us to protect the disadvantaged, even at the expense of overall stability. Each side is convinced the other is mad or bad, yet it's precisely in the dialogue between sides that we find truth and humanity flourishes. We can protect our groups and maintain compassion. So this experiment wasn't to make someone switch from one narrow political story to another. I think what emerged in Phil's defining moment was something more important and more unifying, which is kindness. I need to start lookin' at things differently and... and helping where I can, and... changing my outlook on things, and I just couldn't... I couldn’t have rightfully stepped aside and watched him get killed.
