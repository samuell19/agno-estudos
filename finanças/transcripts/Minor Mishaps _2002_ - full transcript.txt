Come, put your clothes on, and we will go for a ride. - if it's true... - you are really sick in the head You just have to know that if you close the door now, you are alone with dad. I am not against that. It's you I am against! Is it that why you can't be touched? You can't be gotten from under the arms. That's also what mom used to say: Det er ogs? det, mor altid har sagt: "Eva is fragile. " It's a shame mom is dead! I think the best is that you just go away. I think you are sick! Yes!

Shh, total silence now, Ellen. - IS it going well? - Yeah, I am preparing lunch. - Maybe you were not so well. - I don't think we should talk about that. - Do you want to go to the movies? - I don't know. Na... no... I also have some accounts, so... And there comes a suspicion that she is a lesbian. - She is not a lesbian. - I can realize when I see a crane driver. I can't believe this.

Ok, come, I will take you to the hospital and I will go get Niklas. - Pelle said you where here. - Here I am. I think we have to do something with our life. yes, but is this enough? is it enough, S?ren? I thought so. You just lie on the sofa all day, you never read a book. And when I talk about travelling you look at me as if I where an idiot. S?ren, I think, we must be toghether. Not necesarily. So, let's eat some McDonald's-something. They will be ready with your mother later. It takes really long, doesn't it? Lets try not to spil. It's an expensive car we are in. If we spil we spil. What the hell. Damn it. Yes, my family does not pick up the phone. I have called them 17 times. It's a burger with toys inside. It's for you. No, I will just run over to Marianne. - You have just called her. - She has the answering machine on all the time. Have you thought, that it might be, becasue she is not home? John, she is 29. She can have her own answering machine if she wants. Or what? I just don't want her to do anything stupid. Has anything happened? Eva was here and asked me a lot of things. A lot of what? If Marianne and me had slept toghether. Sorry... what did you say? I just laughed to show her she was wrong. Now you will put your jacket on and go kick Eva in the ass. - - and you will tell her, she is completely wrong. - Becasue she is totally wrong, isn't she? - Yes, damn it! Why the fuck don't they answer the phone? I don't like this job, Tom. I don't feel like answering the phone and archiving letters and... You can't quit now. I can find another place for you. I don't want to be a secretary when I grow up. Then we will hire a doll for the reception. What is that? Why the hell haven't you answered the phone? I called about 500 times. I have been in the hospital in Hvidorve for four hours! And I have taken care of a kid! First came Eva to talk about some shit! And then Britt smashed her hand with the door of my car! Damn it, Lisbeth! I have booked a room for you in the SAS Hotel. - Can't you hear what I say? - Yes, I can. Britt is alone with her little kid. I should have picked him up in the Kinder garden. I had smashed my hand. He hates Niklas. Can't we just go to the bedroom and fixe thing. darling? What? Lisbeth, I don't need this. Hello? Eva, are you home? Hi, it's me. - I am preparing coffe. - Thanks as giver. I have put on a clean shirt. That was it I thought. I have to have a coffe with my big daughter. I think you have done it. And I am right. Right? Not in my wildest dreams. Do you want to look in my eyes for once? - Say, you did not do it. - I did not do it, Eva. Again. I have not done it with you. Not with Tom, not with Marianne. I could not dream of doing it. the coffe is cancelled. - What the fuck do you think? - I don't know what to believe. Damn, you are not nice, dad. Dad... Dad! - Tom. - Dad has been taken to the Hospital. Rigs hospit. Maybe I was wrong. I might have killed him. It's enoguh! I have known John all my life! Yiu will say something nice to him! Are you trying to kill him? As if there wasn't any shit on the way! - I will go see him. - They said, we have to wait. I think your intuition has to take a break. Tom... I want to apologize. If I was wrong I want to apologize. I don't think we should talk about that. I have the right to say I am sorry. Dad and I have had such a nice time toghether since mom died. And you make it so horrible. - Is it something we can over come? - I don't know. It's as if I can't say anything else than sorry, can I, Marianne? But you behave strange. I am normal Eva. I have an education, I have a job. I think it's you who is strange. Maybe I am sad because, - - I wasn't sad when mom died. And you where totally ruined about it. No. - You can't be here. - It's my father. Yes, you will have to wait until we call. Can't you tell him he has to stop working? He kills him self working. And we have just lost out mother. I can get himself a hobby. He can get a little boat, so he can polish it and drink coffe. Your dad has asked to be alone until he is completely recovered. So, there he is again- Look. Hi, you. Do you want to stop working? Are you going to keep working and die, or what? - Tom, leave dad alone. - You will get a gravestone. Nothing with urns and the unknown graves. That Hippy shit. Take it easy, Tom. In a few weeks I will be ok. - Shut up, man... - Lets stop speaking about death. We can talk about minor mishaps, but not death. Yes? hm, It's Marianne. Good morning. What time is it? it's 6:02 AM. You want to come in? It was because you had asked if I wanted to go to the movies. - I am coming down. - Ok. It was... or... I want to go to the movies some time. Good. Hi. Hi. I don't really know what is going on. I don't know what I should do? I miss Pelle, and all that. Me too. I called him. And then they called back and said, - - that it was not necesary to drive piles. He promised. We will not bid. What are you talking about? We are not going to have the course center. We have enough. Do you realize how much time we have put in to this? We both have families, Anders. I have two kids. Theirs names are Martin and Hasse. I know what their names are. God damn it, man! God damn it, what a crap, man! Is it ment to be a horse? - No, it was a mistake - Where is there a horse? - Bye. - bye, bye. Say hi to Niklas. What don't I have a husband, Tom? S?ren would not be able to stand me. - It was him who took my virginity. - What? Yes, yes, I was 14, he was drunk and it was 100 years ago. Shit, what a family. Can I get some more money? O yes, sure... yes. I have writen a haiku poem. Do you have your Haiku poem in the drwaing book? - "I will build a house. " - Mmm. - "and put windows in it. " - yes. "who paints the walls?" Shit, it's terrible man. There is a great place next to the hotel with live performances and stuff. That's the way it was that time. Dad, we wont stay in the hotel. We will rent a car and drive around the islands. It's also possible to sail to Lagomera. So, now I have closed the door. Bye, dad. - Take care. - The same to you. We want to pay ourselfs for the trip. No, I got payed from the life ensurance. I am Denmarks richest pensionist. See you, dad. So...
