Ex-San Francisco vice cop hired by Hollywood division to investigate the international drug cartel run by Matt Palmer. Ryan Hayes. A homicide detective who teams up with Samantha that begins the investigation of a possible drug war in the city of Los Angeles. Samantha's something of a cowboy even though she is a detective for vice. In Hollywood, trash like this gets it from the business end of Sam's .38. Matt Palmer. Ex-CIA operative overseas and presently head of Palmer enterprises. His operations in heroin trade have brought him to the city of Los Angeles. Matt and his aide, Carl pond, are organizing regional drug dealers to form a heroin distribution center in L.A. county. Palmer fears only one man, that's Walter singlaub, major drug supplier. Nigel best, adult movie maker and contact for both Ryan Hayes and Matt Palmer. He's best known for what goes down in the city. Bart north. LAPD cop assigned to the Palmer case and briefly works with Samantha rork. Johnny Harper, a detective who's been teamed with Sam with the understanding that the two detectives will pool their resources to solve a string of drug-related murders. Captain renway heads the Palmer investigations, and bulldogs his detectives to squelch the drug war that's brewing in the streets of Hollywood. Ryan! Hello, love, come on in. Who's your friend? She's my partner. What about the hit over at the Beverly? Horrible, wasn't it? I don't know, this is becoming such a pit of filth. Look, I know you're not into dealin' anymore, but you hear things, right? They'd kill me for what I know. But I'm harmless these days. I got out when the Colombians came in. So, what's going down in the city? I don't normally do this, but Ryan and I go back a long ways. You still seeing that little makeup girl from Henry raisin's crew? You follow any of the coke around in this city, honey, and it goes back to singlaub. And I hear Manny catoza is supplying a lot of his muscle. But there's a new syndicate coming into Hollywood. Cubans, east coast, what are we talkin' about? These are really bad motherfuckers, ex-CIA. When Carter left office, half of the foreign operatives were cut and they went into drugs. From what I hear, they're doing pretty good. But do you have any names? No. Does Carlos zarutti mean anything to you? He's the Italian. He's also partners with the guys that are bringing all of the heroin into Hollywood. Where is he livin' now? Monaco, of course. So when's this gonna go down? How the fuck should I know? I have my own business to run. You know something, sweetie, you could make a fortune in my business. You're really cute, you know that? No thanks, I'll pass. Look, what's Henry up to these days? Now there's a guy who keeps up with the trades. Half his bimbos are on junk. Buys it by the kilo. But you don't quote me on that. Sure. Well, thanks for your time. Leaving so soon? Yeah, we gotta beat the traffic. See ya around, Nigel. Ryan? Take a look at this, love. New girl I found, she's really hot. No thanks. X he's doin' time x Carl? Nigel. Listen, love, I've just had a visit from a couple of homicide people. They're on your ass. No, I didn't tell them anything. Look, why do you have to bring that up every time I try and give you something? No, no, I won't be at home tonight. I've got an evening shoot over in the valley. Okay, love, ciao. Oh, little maxie. He's so cute. Lipstick on his chin. How's your leg, huh? - It's good. - Feels good. Oh, but the lipsticks you got is your shade. Get that. Take care of 'em. Oh, Max. Take care of 'em! Look at these things. They must feed 'em with blow. Mine die in a week. Well, do you water them? Water? Listen, I'm gonna go around to the back, okay? Just relax, Sam. Enjoy the scenery. Can I help you? LAPD homicide. Where's Max? He's in the den, he's busy. Are you really a cop? Tell him I wanna see him. Sure. Kim, keep him happy. You got it. How ya doin, huh? Police, freeze! Where the hell ya been, Sam? Out back hunting rabbits. Look, I'm gonna try real hard to stay calm here, huh? Now I just wanna know one thing. Why wasn't I informed about this action? Brother set her up. Routine lead. Yeah, we didn't know the guy was gonna flip out on us. 1 don't like what I'm hearing here. I mean, good god almighty, this place looks like a squashed armadillo on a Texas interstate! Now channel 7's gonna get enough footage outta this mess so the chief is gonna have you two on mandatory desk assignment! What the hell ya think we're dealin' with here? Born again Bible students? You write the report, we'll see. Sir, we've got a lead on the cochet killing. Now this thing is getting red hot and we have got to move on it right now. Oh, you mean, like, Nigel best? What'd he have to say? He got barbecued in his car yesterday! Now, as of this moment, the FBI is takin' over this case. Now hold on a minute, captain. This is our jurisdiction. Now, we're on to something here, and they'll have to start from square one. Well? What do you have to say, Hayes? Give us to the end of the week. Hey, they already got our asses in a sling. If the feds take over from here, they'll really rub our noses in it. All right, but you two are gonna promise me somethin', hear? You're gonna keep the noise down! Right, captain. A little girl was tappin'. Workin' on one ulcer already. Everything looks very healthy out there. It's your audience, sir. Nervous, are they? That shootout at Wells's house didn't help. Yeah, what's the story on that? Two cowboys from the Hollywood division. Detectives Ryan Hayes and Samantha rork. They did us a freebie hit. Maybe we should put 'em on our Christmas card list. Rork, that name is familiar. What do you want me to do with Henry raisin? - What? - Raisin. He's getting too big to ignore. If singlaub gets a hold of him, we're in deep shit. The skin king. Contract it out with the Colombians. That guy's a fruit, I don't like him. Limited or you want the place raked? Splatter it. Time? Let's talk about this after the meeting. All right, one more thing. What do you want with the green card? Send herin. Yes, sir. So, you want to be an americano? Yes. Maybe I can help. Relax, just business, honey. Okay. Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please. Mr. Palmer will be here in a few minutes. He wants me to congratulate you and thank you for coming for what will become the biggest network in the country. And here he is. Last year the Los Angeles basin had street sales totalling in excess of $400 million. We are going to double that figure using advanced networking and steady entrepreneurial management. The weak link in any operation in our trade is instability of the local distributors of our products. You have each been selected because your record speaks for itself. Our sources are stationed in the far east, Mexico, and Bolivia. Our plants are under the protection of the zarutti family in marseilles. We can offer you the best product, one that can be cut by a ratio of 20 to one. We are talking profits, gentlemen, that will rival those of any fortune 500 corporation. And what do I ask from you? Commitment and loyalty. You may well ask yourself, what will happen if you break this commitment? Holy shit! What the hell happened? Pure retribution. Lunch will be served in the east wing. We'll have representatives there to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, gentlemen. Disgraceful. Goodnight. Hey. Don't go. Good morning. You sleep well last night? Not really. It's always kinda awkward sleeping in a new bed. How 'bout you? Cut the bull. You were great last night. I thought I was gonna melt. Fair? Me, too. So where do we go from here? I don't know, this is the first time for me. Oh, so you're a virgin? No, I meant with someone on the force. This could get in the way of work, ya know. What do ya think? Well, this is only temporary, and after this case we do go back to our own divisions. So what do you say we just keep it quiet until we're done. All right. Ya know, it's kinda funny sleepin' with your partner. Oh, but it's all right to sleep with the girls from ticketing, billing, and interrogation, huh? Don't believe everything ya hear. I think it's just the first time that you've met someone that's your equal. On the streets, and in bed. What, are you Phil donahue? Ya know, you put up a good act, but last night you really did come through for me, and I'm gonna remember it, always. You're one tough hombre, rork. What's this? That's raisin's address book. Are you nuts? That's tampering with evidence on a site of an active police investigation. Look, you can stop the recording. I know it was illegal. I'm just tryin' to do what worked for me three years ago. You can't solve cases with renway's red tape. You're lookin' at a hundred plus caseload solved by badge number 2314, me. So, did you go through it? Yeah. Well, did ya find anything familiar? Try p. Matt Palmer. Wonder if that's the guy that worked with my dad. Really? Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me if he was involved with this crap. So, when are we gonna act on it? Tomorrow. Why not today? The barbecue! Well what if it goes down tonight? If I miss this barbecue, I'm gonna be hearin' about it till Christmas. Hayes. Yeah. All right. Yes, captain. Bye. Renway brought in the FBI and the atf. What about the DEA? They didn't return his call. He gave us a four-day rest before we resume duty. Shit, and right when we're gettin' this close? And he's pulling the plug on us? He's just keepin' his nose clean. Damn. You know, I hate the politics in this job. It's the same crap that happened to me in San Francisco. Look, we're gonna play this real cool. Palmer won't be movin' anything on the weekend. He'll wait till things are busy on a business day. Just tell renway you're outta town for the weekend. Do you think we can break this case in four days? Come on, we're the best, right? Yeah. What, are you burnin' trash out here? Ryan, you made it. - Janey. - Hi. My god, you brought a girl? Isn't this a first, Ryan? Hi, I'm janey and this is Jack. - Hi, go by Sam. - Hi, how ya doin"? You don't hear that name too often. It's nice to have you come. You wanna help me? Sure. What's up, big brother? Sam's my partner. Oh. And we're dating, may be serious. We're finally thinkin. Janey and I were wonderin' when that little boy would get outta your system. How are things down at the airlines? Eh, crashes aren't makin' it easy with janey. She makes me cross myself when I'm at the controls. And if the crashes don't get me, it'll probably be a merger of some sort. Luckily you don't have that with the city. Yeah, things are pretty good downtown. Are you workin' on anything? Been readin' the times lately? Nope, been in Australia for the last week, bud. Sam and I are investigating a drug ring. Ah, god, you're amazing. I go downtown and I miss everything. You always did have a sixth sense when it came down to things happenin' you noticed. Finally, after all these years, you noticed. You're a natural, okay? I mean, you even knew who did what in school, and you're still crazy, but you're good. Thanks. How are the burgers doing? Raw and abused. So, you're Ryan's brother? You two sure look different. Yeah well, mom traveled a lot. Yeah, somebody had to get the good looks. Do you like it here? Yeah, it's nice. I'm still tryin' to get used to the smog, but the beach is great. You live near Ryan? Well, I'm sort of living with Ryan right now. Yeah, her place is getting remodeled. You know how new paint smells. Yeah. So, working for the police, it must take most of your time, huh? Well, I love my work. But what about the future? Children? Let's keep it light, guys. It's okay. I really don't want any. Really? That's interesting. But who knows what tomorrow will bring. I may change my mind. This house is great, you know. Eh, it's gettin' kinda small for us. Who knows, maybe you'll buy it. No, I like where I'm livin' right now, on the beach. But it's so small, Ryan. I like it small. We need to get more beers. Janey, help me, please? Yeah. Well? They're nice. Yeah, they used to live in Connecticut. Place called Stepford. How did the hit go? They captured one of our trigger men. Real sloppy work on our account. That's what ya get when ya contract it out. Well, we're in the clear even if that cokehead talks. I'm surprised they had trouble with security, though. Raisin must be paying more. It was these two again. They got Maxwell last week. I think they're trouble. Sam rork. Used to work with her father. Now it all comes back to me. So she's a cop now. That doesn't surprise me. When you were overseas? Yes. I was dealing with zarutti back then. They blew away this girl's father and mother. Found out we were moving more than paper through those diplomatic pouches. What a straight arrow he was. I bet his daughter's the same. Well these two are askin' about us now. Whatever you have to do, I want them eliminated. I'll make a not of that. Also, I want you to take a team to singlaub and show him that he's not doing good business with us. I will. Videotape it. We'll send a copy through the network. Why? Just good business. Keep our team from moving to the other side. I heard they got the FBI setting up. The deal will be finished before they can plug their computers in. It's a green light on the shipment. Sunday we collect, and Monday I want the product to the distributors. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir, I'll make sure everything's taken care of. Good. See that singlaub gets the message. I will. Nice place. Yeah, well, it's a habit I can't break. You'll never understand me. And I've already accepted that. So, how 'bout this Sam? Well, a little premature. We've only been together a week. It's nothin" you two are it. How can you tell? The chemistry is there. Really? Be right back. Come on, babe, don't stop it. - Thereiitis. - How 'bout that. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. I'm the leader! Good evening, marriott hotel. May I help you? I'm at the marriott hotel. Yeah, I got it all. Just meet me here in about an hour. Okay, bye. Yeah, the fishing is incredible. I was catching steelheads this size. I've been meanin' to get up there. Anytime you're interested, I can get you booked with the hottest guide in Victoria valley. I'll remember that. Sam, come on in, have a seat. Sam, I'd like you to meet your new partner. Bart north. Samantha rork. Sam's been with the department a few weeks now. I guess you've heard about Hayes and all that crap. I won't go into that. Now what are we gonna do about it? You ain't gonna do nothin' about it. Last thing I need is a vigilante out on the streets. Now you and north have been assigned to the projects. We have some evidence that there's some small timers up there workin' outta 31st street. I want 'em outta the neighborhood. What are they packin'? These days ya never know. Probably .22 autos. These guys can't afford any high-priced merchandise. Are you afraid? It's my bad ass luck that Jerry ragusso retired when he did. Cut it out, you two. This ain't no damn date. Ya don't get to pick your partners. Now maybe you two can learn somethin' from each other. Oh yeah, right. Listen, rork, you're still on loan from vice. Be real easy to send you home again. Stop playing politics. I'm here and I'm gonna finish this stint. Another Chuck Norris. Just get the job done, okay? Make the chief real happy. You probably don't like donuts. You're right. We're not eating at any place that has ferns, hear me? Sam. Let's try to keep the body count down this week, okay? I will. Just find out who killed my partner. I will. Hold it. This is how it's gonna go down. You kick, I enter, and we nail those punks. All right, Rambo. I smell a rat here. Freeze! Samantha, Samantha, what's the problem? Maybe this was a mistake that I came. No, it was not a mistake. That's what I'm here for. Now, what's going on? Things are just really fucked, doc. Just really fucked. All right, tell me where it hurts the most. Maybe we can fix it, okay? God, it hurts, doc. It hurts so bad. Samantha, don't be so tough on yourself. Take it easy. You know you're entitled to your own feelings. You're a human being. It's not a sin to feel hurt. It's Ryan. Ryan's dead. You know, we've had that discussion about your brother's death, and now Ryan. You've gotta work through those feelings. You gotta ride them through. You can, you know. It's me, though. I'm a death sentence. You're a person in a very, very dangerous occupation. My partner got shot today. Go on. We went to investigate this doper over in the heights, and Bart and I went in, and he was shot and now he's dead. And you? God, Christ, I shot the two son of a bitches. Why do I always have to live, doc? All right, Samantha, we've been here before. Now, I want ya to take a deep breath and we're gonna count to 10 backwards. Here we go. 10. 10. Nine. Nine. Eight. Eight. Seven. Seven. Six. Six. Five. Five. Four. Four. Three. Three. Two. Two. One. One. Samantha, I want ya to promise me never to keep your revolver in your home. Always keep it in your car whenever you're here. Agreed? 1'm a cop. What if someone tries to break in? At this moment, you're your own worst enemy. Do what I say. Okay, I will. But I'm not gonna leave the force. You're gonna be all right, Samantha. But I want ya to call me every day. Okay, I will. Doc, I'm really glad I have somebody like you. You got it. How's the handicap? I don't know why I bother with this damn sport. I lost three balls today. I got some bad news. I know. Zarutti's pissed. He wants to know who messed up. How am I supposed to know? Cochet was his girl. I set this deal up and nothin's going to get in the way of it. He says the cops are in the neighborhood. You think Charles singlaub's behind this? Possibility. He knows that if we get this deal through we'll be able to control all the action on the west coast. My guys say he's getting help from Manny catusso in east L.A. There's rumors. There's gonna be some rockin' and rollin' the next couple of days. He's thrown up enough shit to get the distributors spooked. Catusso's smart. He's gonna try to knock us out. Without that bag, we don't know what we've got. You gonna send another guy? If they try to screw us, they know they're in for a hit. I want you to keep your eyes on the gangs in town. What about the cops? Singlaub's the one we have to worry about. From what I hear, he has half the department on his payroll. I made arrangements to have all the distributors at your house on Friday. Good. I want everyone there. The guys know what to do. From the first step they take into my house, I want them to know what kinda shit they're up against if they drop out. Yes, sir. Beats workin' for the company. Absolutely. See ya later tonight. Sounds good, around nine. Hey, Johnny. What are you doin' here? You know, I hear the surf's real bitchin' down at the swimmin' pool. Enough of the jokes. What's goin' on? Well, her name is Elizabeth mcintyre. Tom's got all of her papers, passport, visa, traveler's checks, and a hell of a lotta cash. Sounds like an American express commercial. What else? Well, the lady was well-pampered. You know, hairstyle, the manicure, the beautiful skin. But guess what? I found traces of iv use, two to three years. Did ya find any smack in the place? Nah, clean, not a speck. Hm, how many entry wounds? Six. No wait, make that nine. Nine millimeter, probably from an uzi or an ingram. So somebody musta heard somethin'. Well, Tom did all the interviews. Far as I could tell, she was ambushed from the corner of the room by the closet. Bazoom, she fell over the bed. That's where we found her. What do you think, mob hit? I don't know. You're the detective. Aw, thanks. Hey, Johnny. Hey, did anybody see anything? Ah, the rooms around here were vacant. But I got a maid who can't speak a word of english. Thank god I could speak a little of her lingo. She said she saw two strange men hangin' out at the pool area. Is that it? I'm afraid so. Too bad we didn't find a joint. Coulda brought vice in on this one. Lemme go. Lemme go. Absolutely, no. Hey, donuts. No, we've got to get this signed. We doused everything in there. Did we? Okay, yeah, well. Hey, captain. Who's this? Yes, absolutely. It's your new partner for the next month. What? The chief has decided to experiment with this department. We're gonna team up a homicide with a vice cop. You two are it. Why didn't I have a say about this? Well now maybe, just maybe, 'cause you're not the captain. I am! All right, you'll be takin' on the mcintyre case. Detective Sam rork, I'd like ya to meet detective Johnny Harper. How ya doin"? You're awful young. That's a switch. You could learn a lot from rork. She used to live overseas. Worked vice up in frisco. Oh yeah, they got a great need for breakin' up those bathhouses up there. Captain, this is not gonna work. You know me. Yeah, I know. That's why I teamed you two up. Well, at least you smell better than my last partner. Hey listen, I'm not exactly thrilled about this deal either. Now the last thing I need is another little man with a big gun, ya got it? Knock it off, enough Patty cakes, 'Kay? Now what did interpol have on this woman? Elizabeth mcintyre, alias sylvette cochet. Worked for marseilles underground. Former heroin addict. Fashion model for vogue. Circle of friends include Regis vendatta, Sterling fuchs, Carlos zarutti. Any of those rooms sound familiar? Carlos zarutti, he does business in L.A. occasionally. He just might be behind this. That woman mighta been carryin' for him. The lab did find traces of heroin dust in cochet's luggage. I knew it, I knew drugs are behind this. Aren't they always in this town? So you think she was hit for the heroin that she was delivering? This point rork, I don't think anything. Who knows, word coulda gotten out some young punk lookin' for a score mighta taken her down. With an ingram, right, captain? That's why I have you people, Mr. smarty pants. Now get off your ass, get out there, and find out what's passin' on the streets! Are we the only two that are involved in this case, captain? Truth is, rork, this case wouldn't rate page 39 in any big city daily. Just get us a clean report and we'll get the chief off our back, okay? I'm leavin' it up to you two. What car do we get to use? Yours. Thank you, captain. See ya around. So, you're from San Francisco. Not really. My brother and I moved here about a year ago. You see, my father was a marine so we traveled abroad a lot. Why'd ya move to L.A.? It's kinda personal. Do you mind if we change the subject? You find out your boyfriend was gay? No, my brother died of cancer. Sorry. Are you always such a prick? Only to people that know me. Hey, that stereo's not regulation. Now what if a call came over the radio? I know, but I like it. Renway warned me about you. Gimme the cliff notes. What'd he say? He said you used to be a hotshot in the vice when you first came on. Those were wild days back then. You're too young to be burned out. I just set my priorities. I wanna see my hair gray, grow my double chin, collect my pension. It's too soon and I don't buy it. You know, I know people pretty well and I know you're not that type. Oh really? Isn't this place great? Yeah, it's great. I come here every morning after surfing. Oh, you surf? Yeah, I do. Do you know how? Oh, I tried it once in Hawaii, but I'm really not very good at it. Well, if you could surf the way you shoot, I don't think you're gonna have any problem. Who taught you how anyway? It was your dad or the department? My dad. He was stationed in a couple embassies where they had their own shooting ranges, so my brother and I would hang out on the weekends and just blow the place away. Was he a cop, too? No. So how do you know Carlos zarutti? Well, we lived in Paris and my father used to talk about how the CIA would deal with the mob in marseilles. Well, you wouldn't believe some of the things that go on in those places. I mean, there's this one guy named Matt Palmer, he's a real asshole. The CIA stationed him with us. Geez, I'll never forget that bastard. Where's your dad stationed now? My mom and dad were killed in a car bomb in Paris about six years ago tomorrow. - Christ. Did they ever find out who did it? Well Palmer seems to think that the palestinians had something to do with it, but I think that he and zarutti were in on it. Thing is I can't prove anything. But if you saw the look on Palmer's face when I left. Bastard. I'm surprised they let you on the force. What do you mean by that? Well, didn't ya have to tell this stuff to a shrink during orientation? Well let's just say that I used my selective memory recollection. But what about you? I mean, you look more like you belong in a budweiser commercial than the LAPD. Well, when I got outta the army, I was looking for a job that would allow me to surf, and they were begging for guys willing to cut their hair. You used to be a hippie? No, I'd call it post-flower power. Well, do you have any photos from back then? I got a bunch of 'em. My dad was one of those wedding photographers. Yeah? Oh yeah, put her through. Samantha, Samantha, how are things going? Oh, you got a new partner. Well that sounds like progress. All right. Okay, stay in touch. You got 'em? Yeah, found 'em in the garage. This idea of us goin' away was pretty smart. God knows we both need it. You got Vancouver, Maui, and St. Croix. Ryan always raved about Maui. Don't do this. He's gone and we can't bring him back. We've got to go on with our work, our vacations, and everything else, okay? I'm just being stupid. No you're not. It's hard knowin' he's not gonna be around. Look at me. I shoulda thrown all this stuff in the dumpster at his office. Now why didn't renway pick this up? Honestly, I don't even think that they care. They're just bastards. Well, I didn't wanna bring this up, but I was talkin' to some of the guys at Ryan's old hangout. They knew. If they know, why don't they get him? They can't move without a thread of evidence. I'll go. No you won't. Got somethin' better planned. You're not going after that maniac! You're right. Maybe the police don't give a damn. But he was my only brother, and if this guy's out there, I'm gonna get him. Ryan was trained. You're a pilot. These people are animals. You're going, aren't you? Ryan would've done it if I'd got killed. What about the police? The guys said they're treading lightly on the case. I guess the chief wants the PR to die down. It's typical. Listen, I want you to go to your sister's. I'll call you when everything's done. What about Sam? She could lose her job if this spoils, so call her if I don't come home by tonight. You know you're crazy. Runs in the family. So, is this place always this crowded? You oughta see it on weekends. Yeah, I bet. Why don't ya go check it out. Or is that against regulations? This is against regulations. Aw, you're breakin' my heart. You know, ya don't have to get me drunk or anything. We're not on a date. I just figured you were a heavyweight, you know, the way you shoot your gun. Ya know, sometimes you can be a real prick. Hey, I meant that as a compliment. Accepted. So how'd ya get so tough? How did you? Me? I was a runt. Nobody even wanted to pick me for their football team. I was five-foot-four till I was a senior in high school. Well, I can see your nose is still intact. Uh-huh, your turn. Did ya ever see the movie "the great santini"? You know the one about the gung-ho fighter pilot and his family? Yeah, Robert duvall was in it. Well, 1 didn't know anything different. Knuckle pushups? Military burpees. Pugil sticks at the breakfast table? Close. Oh, geez. Get over here. What do you want from me? What? Your life! Yeah, how do ya like that? Yeah, ya like this shit? Yeah, do it more, asshole. Go ahead, I like it. Fuck you. You're gonna like this. You're gonna like this one. Die, fucker! Die! Yeah. Oh, put her through. Hello, Samantha. Well it sounds like your life is really coming together. How would you like not having to call me anymore? Okay, you got it. Bye. She's quite a looker. A real fighter in bed. You know she'll come after us when she finds out we've got her partner. That's the whole point. I don't understand. Sometimes there are things more important than just business. I see. Having singlaub under my foot is a great feeling. I'm sure the meeting will be a success. We'll see. You little shit! Come on, you're gonna like what we have in mind for you. Come herel come on. Yeah, yeah, come here. Hey! Ah! Shit! No!
