Ahh! See you downstairs, darling. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Buddy, time to get up! Hey, Dad. Hey. Need something? Yup, here we go! Ah, you have a date? No varsity match. The guy I'm wrestling is allergic to alcohol, so he uses Vaseline under his pits, I use aftershave.[CHUCKLING] Well, to victory and the agony of aftershave. Touche.Go for it! Come on! [GRUNTING] Listen, Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something too. Do you need money? No, no it's not money. Well, sort of, in a way. It's about college. You heard from Stanford? The wrestling scholarship came through? No, I haven't heard anything. Huh.It's a... Listen. Look Dad, about Stanford, I really can't... It's a great school, Buddy. A really great one. You know I wanted to go there and study law. But you get sidetracked, you get married, raise a family, BARBARA: Whenever you guys are ready! Be right there! Here you go. What's that for?That's for being a rotten kid. You ain't seen nothing yet! Come on, get out of here! I'm late, talk to you later! Listen, Mom, you got to help me with Dad, I can't talk to him. Buddy, we've been over this before, and I hate the idea. I really do. I'm not getting into it with your father. It's your fight.What am I asking? Some time off. I just can't handle four more years right now. I'll be 19 instead of 18, big deal. Big deal? You'll put off college one year, then two. Then you'll get a job, you'll make some money... And wind up like Dad. You're terrific, Buddy. He wants something better for you than he had. It's not what I mean. Stanford is outrageously expensive and it hasn't been exactly raining money around here lately. I'm not even sure I wanna be a lawyer, I don't know what I want to be. It was his idea for me to go there. I... A guy changes, you know? He grows up. You're so grown up, you talk to him. Honey, have you seen my briefcase? Oh there it is. Coffee's still hot. I got a listing waiting. Oh, I'll be late tonight, Dan's office party, remember? Uh, talk to your son, he has a problem. Spoke to him this morning. Not arm wrestling, Eddie, talking. I will. I promise. Bye. EDDIE: You got your wall-to-wall carpeting. And the den, fully landscaped yard, there's a lot of bucks there. This is a nice house to raise kids, great neighborhood. Do you think they'd come down to 100,000? [CHUCKLES] Hey, that's... It's tough. It's tough. Right now, you're both working? And then when the baby coming, it's, it's gonna be tough. But everybody deserves a house of their own, hmm? It's the American dream, right? I think we can borrow most of the down payment. But it's the monthly payment that'll kill me. Well let's say that you make the down. You take out a short-term loan, you keep the payments low. And then later on, you get a better job. Nah, forget it. Forget it. Those loans, they're a rip-off. They'll hit you with a ballooned payment down the line that'll break your back. Let me work on it, hmm? This house is right for you kids and I want you in it! DAN: I'm talking about the right actor. Look at Tad Voss. Take a look at the record he's got. I mean look at that, 3,750,000. Numero uno!Thank you very much! DAN: 3,750,000![APPLAUSE] It's easy with a boss like you. [GUESTS CHATTERING] Oh. You can't be number one forever. Well, the kid's moving big money homes. I'm strictly a meat and potatoes man. Well, we all know where that market went. To the return of the 10% interest. Amen to that, excuse me now, Robin. Hey, Ronnie! Eddie! How are you doing?What came down on my loan request, huh? Oh, Eddie, come on. This is a party. Come on. Are the kids gonna clear the loan committee or not? Eddie, they read out lousy. His gross income stinks, she's pregnant and out of a job in three months. I can't show that to the committee. Tell them to buy a mobile home. The loan came up sour. No, don't get upset. There are other houses. I know, I know. You had your heart set on that one. But we'll find something else. I'll hit the listings and I'll find something that's... Something that's more affordable. Yeah, I'll call you soon.[TAPPING] Yeah, alright, yeah sure. You bet, take care. Dan is looking for you. Oh dear, don't tell me. I know... You can't die. I lost them. Last sale, bottoms up. Ouch. Well, I think you're still the best salesman that Dan Hatten ever had. Here, things are gonna pick up. I needed that last closing. And those poor kids. Honestly... Ah, why should I make myself crazy? Toot? What's the matter? Stop looking at me like I'm some kind of an axe murderer. Really, it's okay. Everybody's doing it. Anyway, it's Friday, so come on. I'm a scotch man. Well, that'll rot your liver, that's for sure. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] See? No looney tunes. Still smiling, okay? Why do you do that stuff? Same reason you drink and I don't. Makes me feel good. You want to dance? Let's go, hot shot! The emperor's about to make his speech. As a lot of you know, TransAllied Properties has been talking to me about an acquisition merger. On Wednesday this week, I put the old John Hancock on the papers, and I can officially welcome you to the west coast office of TransAllied Properties Incorporated, Daniel H. Hatten, President! [CHEERING] He didn't tell you, did he? [BREAKS CUP] Hey, kiddo! Oh, come on, you knew we were talking. You promised me, Dan. Three, you had three people when I first came here, you got 50. And you helped put them here, now come on, this is Danno. I'll take care of you, haven't I always...Really? Well, where's my partnership? I don't see my name up there. It was a corporate buy-out, even my name isn't up there. I thought you were my friend.Hey... [GASPS] Eddie, don't do that to me. What are you doing home so early? Why didn't you invite him in? For your information, that was your son. I went to the movies with him and Howie. Now, don't you feel dumb? Honey. Yoo-hoo? Hey, come on. Come on. Eddie, I'm flattered that you're jealous. Hey, don't be that way. What's the matter with you? I'm going to bed. [TIRES SCREECHING] Hey, Eddie. My man. Thanks for coming on down here, I really tied one on out last night. Why don't you try turning the key to your belt the next time, alright junior? Hey, come on, hey Eddie, come on, we're both bros. Hey, I owe you one, okay? Forget it. Oh! Come on in, Eddie. You gotta check this place out. So how do you like it, Eddie? What were you in before, cars?[CHUCKLES] Motor yachts, actually. You don't like selling houses. I like making money. You ought to try it, Eddie. Lose some weight, get yourself some clothes. Eddie, you're really good at selling crackers their boxes, but when it comes to luxury homes, you just don't know the market. You're a snob. Absolutely. And I intend to be a very rich snob. [DOORBELL RINGS] You don't mind going out the back way, do you, Eddie? No. [KNOCKS] Dan I just got a call. Oh, Eddie, I'm in a meeting. One of my salesmen, Eddie Gant. Why don't I talk to you later, Dan. Nice meeting both of you. Excuse me gentlemen. [MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, kiddo.Hey, what the hell is going on? A year ago we were talking partnership, all of a sudden, I'm one of your lousy salesman? Well, they're new to me, Eddie. Now give me some time, I'll bring you up, I promise. I want a luxury listing. Now why rock the boat? In a few months, things will loosen up, mid-range buyers will come... Oh, to hell with mid-range buyers. You've got an ex-boat salesman out there that's not yet dry behind the ears. He's leading the pack. I want in, Dan. Eddie, stay with what you know, please... I was number one for 10 years, 10! I brought the best people in here. I trained them! I did it! You owe me for that, Dan. Tad has been coming up cold on one of my exclusives. I'll flop it over to you. BARBARA: You going to let it out or what? No, it's something at the office, business. It has nothing to do with you. I'm in the line of fire. Well, honey, who am I gonna yell at? The lady next door? Hmm? Dan sold out, turns out. Everybody's nervous. Well, you knew that was coming. Well, you know a train is coming too, but you don't think it's gonna hit you. I asked for a luxury list. And Dan agreed? I would have walked and he knew it. Isn't your kind of market, is it? You too, huh? Family housing is a graveyard. We're living on savings for six months and my own wife doesn't think that I can handle a new market? Well, look, I've got news for you, just understand this, honey... Selling is selling. Eddie, don't talk to me like I'm a child. You've always been a salesman, we've had good years, and bad years. Never like it is now, never. Not where I am in my life. We're not exactly on food stamps. We'll survive. Great! We'll survive! Why don't you tell that to the bank? When our house payment comes due, huh? Just tell them we're surviving or tell Stanford we're surviving. And we'll owe them Buddy's tuition. Well, that's one off your shoulders, because your son has decided that he doesn't want to go to Stanford. When did he decide that? He's been working up his courage to talk to you, he wants to take a year off. Find himself or something. Find himself? Kids. Buddy isn't you. He doesn't want the same things... Please, come on. The subject of Buddy is closed. It's closed. [DOORBELL RINGS] You like the hand, take a picture. Numbers are my life. Numbers are his life, how many times did you take the CPA test? They don't kill you for trying, right Eddie? Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, what did you say, Zack? Guy has got a right not to give up. No matter how old he is, right? We're playing poker or doing career testing, come on, it's a half to you. I'll be back in a sec. How can one guy go the bathroom so many times in a night? What's he got, a girl in there? [OTHERS LAUGHING] Okay. Morty takes three.Oh, God. Dealer takes one.Alright. I'm out. Hey, come on, you got two pairs there. What are you doing? Taking arithmetic lessons from Zacker? Accounting takes more brains than pedal pushing. I'm a dealership, I sell quality bicycles. Okay suckers, what's happening? We're playing, or are we playing here? Bet's to you.Alright. Oh, look at that pot, God save me from accountants playing my hand. I raise! Fold. I'm out. Pair of kings, I win and you lose. [LAUGHING] Hey come on, what are you doing? Here we go, come on.It's my deal. Listen, listen. I hate to be a wet blanket, but let's call it, huh? I'm beat. Come on, you guys, it's getting hot here. I'll keep tab. Do it! Do it! One round to kill it, winner takes all. Come on! I got to work tomorrow, open early. Come on, we used to play all night here! Some of us still have wives we got to go home to, Morty. Hey, put a lid on it, huh, Stewie? Hey, you guys wish you were going home to what I got waiting! [LAUGHING] EDDIE: Hey, next week!Ok, so long. Alright, open up. What the... Come on, open up! Or I'm gonna break your neck. Oh damn, I do good work. Uh, what is it, Eddie? I've known you 18 years, man and dentist. You've got a crisis, I can see it in your teeth! Ah! Look at him, he's smiling. What is it, you and Barbara? Come on, get out of the house! There's a world out there! Look at me, better than I was at 20. Give me a shot. Gimme a shot right here. Huh?Come on. Seventeen pounds I lost since I met Jackie. Va-va-va-voom! Come on! Get out, go home to your va-va-va-voom. I reversed the aging process, and it's fun! Come on, take it away! Come on! Argh! [MORT LAUGHING MANIACALLY] Later, will you? Buddy, buddy come on, let's go dancing.Hey Morty, what's happening? Come on, we gotta go dancing. Come on, I just wrestled. Beat it Morty. Go home! [MORTY SHOUTING] What kind of drugs are you feeding Dr. Mort? Too much beer. Yeah, no way. How was your match? Win? Those guys were wimps, we killed them. [CHUCKLES] Son, are you gonna be home on the weekend? No, waterskiing. Howie's folks went into hock and bought a condo. Seems really dumb on his old man's salary. What is it with you kids? Huh? Why are you always down on what parents do? You know we break our backs to make life a little bit better for you, all you can do is moan about how dumb we are. She told you about Stanford and the year off, right? Why don't you wanna go to college? I'm just asking for some time off to find out what I want to do. I mean, I just spent 12 straight years in school. And now everyone expects me to keep up the steam roller and be some kind of lawyer something. I... I don't even like law. You said you did. We used to talk about it. I was 14, Dad, come on. So be anything that you want. What is wrong with going to the best college? Nothing, if you can afford it. What is it with everybody all of a sudden. You don't think that I can afford it? Huh? You're talking to me! I built that office from the ground up. I was number one on the charts for 10 years running. Ten! Every two years, a new car. Who the hell does he think he is? Calling me one of his salesmen? What are you talking about? The issue is closed, you're going to Stanford. You're gonna study law. You're going. Why are we doing this, honey? You know you hate Dan's house parties. I'm supposed to meet the luxury market buyers. I build Dan's business, he buys the big beach house. Selling fancy homes to big buyers, it isn't you. I'll change my image. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] DAN: Hey, Eddie! Listen, didn't I tell you it was casual? Hi, Barbara, sweetheart, how are you? Listen, have a drink, the bar is up there. I'll be around. Hey, Eddie, eyes open, some hot listings here. How does he manage to make me feel so unwelcome, even when he's kissing me? Hi.Hi. We've got to stop meeting like this. You know Bruce Neumann, don't you Eddie? Commerce Bank, Loan Department.Oh, yeah sure. How are you doing? Great. Terrific. You look uncomfortable. Well, nobody told me it was a swim party. Well, these people are barracudas, they cruise in packs and they eat outsiders, so watch it. Do me a favor, kiddo, don't embarrass yourself. This is business. Let them get sloshed if they want to. You need your eyes and your ears to sense a deal. I shouldn't have to tell you that. Fine, I'll go wash my face and I'm in here. That's the Eddie I know and love. Hey, Pat! Pat, come here... Oops. You mind if I just wash up? No, come on in. Robin's been telling me about you. Thinks you're a terrific guy, great salesman. I appreciate that. Says you're in trouble, in a dead market. Oh, I'll dig out. You know, I used to be a lot like you. A lot of big money customers to handle and found out they were handling me. I learned to listen, make myself receptive, never ever push. I gained their trust, they give me their business, it's simple. I've been watching you. Kind of like a student of people. You're afraid of this crowd. So you, shove yourself in a corner and get quietly smashed. [SNIFFS] You'll never sell unless you're one of them. [SNIFFS] Go ahead, everybody needs a boost every once in a while. It's not addictive. I tried grass once, it just made me dizzy. This won't make you feel anything but on top of things, in control. No thanks. Suit yourself. [SNIFFS] You know I'd be speaking out of turn, but, you find something that makes life easier, I say go for it. What do you think makes Tad work 16 hours a day? Uh... That stuff, it doesn't... [NERVOUS LAUGHTER] Doesn't make you act crazy or anything? Do I seem crazy? How do you do it? Just like I did. I feel like an idiot. [SNIFFS] Good. Now the other side. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] You can breathe, Eddie, it's not grass. [SNIFFS] So, um... What do I do now? Now you go out and enjoy. Excuse me. Are you signaling the cheerleader in the bikini? Barb, we ought to think about moving to the beach, perfect traffic flow, kitchen to the sand in one motion. We could get a house mover, move the place down to a beach lot put up a volleyball court, it's be terrific, really, really. You're not driving home. Car keys please. Hey, I feel fine, I feel great. Hi there, nice party! Good to see you again. You know her? Never saw her before in my life, I'll be a minute. Hey! Danno! Hey! Just the guy I wanted to see! You've got a nice place.Hey, our pleasure. Hey, Malcolm! I want you to meet Tad. Hey, Charlie, come here. [ALL CHATTERING] [KNOCKING] Eddie? You read my notes on Marchais? Yeah, Frenchman. Investments or something. [SCOFFS] Not or something. Did you call him personally? He's in Europe. His wife's gonna be there. Look, I've been down the pike a few times. Eddie they're not buying three and a den. These people demand special treatment. So what do you want me to do? Sleep with the lady? If that's what it takes. Hey, loosen up, they'll love you. How do you do, I'm Eddie Gant, Hatten Realty. Hello, I'm Mrs. Linpo, I will interpret for Madame Marchais. How do you do. [INTERPRETER SPEAKING FRENCH] As you can see, the room is quite large. Very nice for entertaining, for parties. I'll tell you they don't make them like this anymore. And the dining room. I want to show you the kitchen. It's just been remodeled. It's one of the nicest... We're not interested in the kitchen. The kitchen is for servants and Madame Marchais does not go into the kitchen, [WOMEN TALKING IN FRENCH] The terrace is very lovely. It opens up from the dining room, as you can see, on one of the most beautiful views that you... Uh, hello? Hello? The view is quite lovely. Uh... [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINE STARTS] Hi there sailor, you new in town? Oh, hey Robin, how's it going? Oh, same old grind. Tad said today was your big day, how did it go? Uh, definite call back. Well that's fabu... No. It was a real stinker, huh? Murphy's law. Everything that could go wrong, did. Well, the luxury market is different. You're a quick study, you'll get into it. [SCOFFS] Eddie, look we've been friends for over five years. Anytime you want to talk over your problems, you just give me a call. You can come over tonight if you like. I'm a great listener. Hey, I can handle it, it's... Friend in need, you know, it's no burden. Here's my address. Now, don't be shy. [PHONE RINGING]Barbara Gant. Yeah!Hi, Eddie, how did it go? Fine. I'm so happy for you. Yeah, she was Chinese, or something. Anyway, she loved the house, really loved it. Listen, why don't... Why don't we grab a steak after work, just... Just the two of us. Oh honey, I'm not even going to get home for dinner, I'm loaded here. How about a rain check for tomorrow? Tomorrow? Uh, well... Yeah, that's terrific. Listen, are you okay, you sound funny. [LAUGHING] I'm great. I'm great, I'll talk to you later. Okay, honey. I called to Barbara to go to dinner but that poor girl, she's up to her neck in work. I won't tell, Eddie, promise. How about a drink? Nothing for me. Well sit down, take a load off. Robin tells me didn't do so well first time out. [CHUCKLES] That's an understatement, I bombed. Well, it takes a certain finesse. And not that I think you can't develop it. Tad had his problems in the beginning too. I helped him put some leads together. I think I'll have a scotch. Sure thing. Ice? Neat. Okay. You know, we ought to get together for lunch sometime. I'm always getting leads in the loan department. You get rolling, you make the deals, I'll make the loans. Sounds great. Thank you. [SIGHS] I really think I ought to leave you two alone. [LAUGHING] Oh, you sound like the ancient mariner. I mean everyone blows a sale once in a while, just give it some time. Time's not on my side. You listen to him, "Time isn't on my side." I saw you at Dan's, I mean you didn't look like a guy ready for the unemployment line. [CHUCKLES] How about something light, hmm? Who's for stir-fry? You cut the bok choy and I'll make the appetizers. You got it! Made a fair size buy from a friend. I let a little out here, a little there. And customers at the bank, like Tad. People I trust, you understand? This stuff is like a commodity in some circles. Better than money sometimes. I don't deal or anything. Whatever it costs me, I get it back. The profit comes from maintaining good business relationships. It's really expensive, isn't it? Yeah, very. But the movers and shakers don't care, they're too busy making money. I go a couple times a week, tops. Purely recreational. Who can afford it? [CHUCKLES] Ooh, thank you, kind sir. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] Ooh, it's good. [SNIFFS] Mmm. [SNIFFS] Ahh! Ah! So, tell me what the problem is, maybe I can help you. You're looking at him. I handle loans, shrinks are on the fifth floor. Toot? Don't you let him be flip with you cause Bruce knows his market real well. You now, all you've got to do is get with the energy flow. Those people can smell desperation a mile off. Everyone's into one-upmanship. Bigger house, fancier car, be somebody, do something. It's all a game, all you got to do is learn how to play it. See, there are the watchers and the doers. The watchers watch the doers do and wonder why they can't scrape together the price of a ticket. That booze is gonna kill you, Eddie. I had this friend, four drinks, zip, right over the La Jolla cliff. Guy's got broccoli for brains, am I right, Rob? Booze will kill you. Yeah, every time. You, um... You mind if I... You kidding? That's what it's for. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] Alright. [MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO] [TURNS OFF STEREO]Come on, I'm trying to fix my speakers. Why don't we call a truce, huh? Listen, I got this thing all figured out. Forget college for now, you take 2 years in the army. They train you at whatever. You get paid, you add that money to the college fund, you come out, you're older and wiser. You traveled they sent you to Germany, Japan and wherever. You'll learn a language, you learn a trade, you take on anything you want, huh? Huh? Join the army, you're serious? Of course, I'm serious. You get out in the world, you get your head on straight, you make some really good moves for a change. Really good moves. I mean you like the physical stuff don't you? Huh? Marching around, you run a few miles, basic training. You'll feel great, really great. What do you wanna go all around the country for running here, running there? In the army you do something that's constructive. What do you think? I think it sucks. Sucks? Huh? Best idea I've ever had and you say it sucks? Really bad.You did say that, didn't you? What are you doing? Don't let go of it. It's a good idea, you think about it. Ooh! I was beginning to worry. I stopped for a couple of drinks. You hungry, you want a sandwich? No, I'm gonna take off a couple pounds. Hey, what are you doing? You know, we oughta rearrange these shelves, the access is all wrong. The glasses should be over here by the sink, you've got the spices here, that doesn't really make any sense. Two drinks and he's the white tornado. I love it when you're in your sexy work clothes. Eddie, I've had this skirt since Buddy was in junior high. Yeah and you look so good in it. I love it. Oh, boy. The Chinese lady must have made an offer. No, no, I just got my act together. Eddie Gant's gonna be a killer out there. Going to be a killer. [BOTH LAUGHING] [ALARM BUZZES] Oh, show's on. Hey, what's with him? I don't know, must have had a good day. Said he stopped for a few drinks. Really bizarre parental behavior.Uh-uh. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS][KNOCKING ON DOOR] BARBARA: Eddie? Yeah.Let me in! Uh, just a minute. When did you start locking the door? I didn't know it was locked. Catching a cold? Allergies. What are you looking at? I'm looking at a pretty woman. Eddie, you're embarrassing me. Second time tonight you've made me a lewd offer. If I can make it to you, how can I not make a lewd offer? Now that is incredible view. Absolutely incredible. And it can be enjoyed from every room in the house. You notice how the living area here, flows right out into the deck, in one graceful sweep. Real indoor/outdoor living, it's, it's really spectacular. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] Hey, Morty, boozing alone? I almost didn't recognize you with your toupee on. I don't wear it much. Rhoda giving you a bad time about the support payments? Pull the wrong tooth, somebody suing you? No, I'm just a little depressed, that's all. I'm sleeping lousy, you know. I'm just getting old. Oh, come on. Everybody gets old, but not my old buddy, Mort, the original Go Get-'em Kid. Hey, come on! Eight months and she walks out. One minute she's there, and now I got empty closets. You mean, Va-Voom? Jackie. Look at me. Look at me. [SOBBING] Eddie, who am I going to attract at my age? Hey, Mort, she was just a kid. I couldn't keep up with her. I tried. I worked 10-12 hours a day and had to party with Jackie. Well, maybe... Maybe you need to see a doctor? I am a doctor, you jackass. Oh, you know what I mean. Eddie listen to me, I'm losing everything. My practice is going to hell, I'm spending money like it was water. You need money? You want a loan?No, no, no. It's not money, Eddie, please, listen... Hey, hold that thought, will ya? A friend of mine just came in. Order me a scotch. Wait, where are you going? Hey, you're looking great, dropped a couple of inches, huh? Working on it. So, uh... How do we do this? This isn't a mafia meeting. Did you put the money in an envelope? You give me that. And I give you this. Seems like an awful little bit for $350. Good quality. Oh, give me a call on Thursday, I got a line on a couple of prospects. Hey, Morty, what are you doing? No. You're busy, I'll catch you later. No, no, no. Sit down, we'll talk... Talk is not gonna do it for me anymore, Eddie. [POP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] [HONKING CAR HORN] Hey, what do you think, huh? What do you think, huh? Hair's not too dark? I don't want to look unnatural. Excuse me, but my husband left the house this Saturday morning and now this other guy shows up in this Cadillac and leather jacket. Come on, get in I'll take you for a ride. Hey, what's going on, we can't afford a car like this. Hey, honey, I got a good buy. Soconian went into escrow, I'm good for 20,000. 20,000!That's fine, but shouldn't we have talked about this, I mean a new car, this whole transformation. Oh, come on, honey, don't ruin it for me. I mean just don't ruin it. I want to enjoy a few things while I still can. I'm not going to be a 47-year old loser. You're not a loser, Eddie, you don't have to prove anything. I'm not trying to prove anything, you wanna go for a lousy ride or not? Yeah, I wanna go for a lousy ride. You don't mind the lousy dirt on your clean seats? Well, get in the lousy car. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] Eddie, it's four in the morning. You're kidding, I thought it was midnight. Hey, Barb, you know that old, beat up Spanish style next to the Barlow listing? I can get the owner to take back a land lease, we could go in there with a bulldozer and clear the place, we'd have a five acre lot, we could make a profit of 200,000 easy. Real easy!Eddie, look what time it is. Come to bed.Hey! Stop it! Honey, I got 'em this time. The games that you can play in six figures, I mean, the money, that's in this town, it's incredible. Eddie, I'm worried about you. I know you love what you're doing, and everything's going so well for you, but... We never see you. You're up to all hours, you're sleeping late. Maybe it's hypertension. I want you to call Dr. Marlin. Honey, there is nothing... I'm fine. I just got these deals whizzing around in my head, that's all. Lately, everything is at double time... Lately, it's always lately. Barbara there is nothing that is wrong with me. I am fine! That is exactly what I'm talking about. [PHONE RINGS] Who could that be at this hour? Hello? Rhoda? No, it's okay, what's wrong? Oh, my God, when? How? How did it happen? Who is it? The kids?No. Do you want us to come over? No, if you need anything, you call us. Eddie will find him. I'm sure he'll be fine. Okay, honey. Bye. What is it? Mort Broome tried to commit suicide. Morty did what? He used a hunting rifle, the bullet went through his collarbone. I can't believe it, I mean... I saw him, what, just... A few weeks ago. He seemed like he was a little bit down, but Jackie, that kid that was... I mean she, she took off on him but, I mean Morty is just not the kind of a guy... What kind of a person tries to kill himself with a hunting rifle? Hey, Morty. Tooth fairy told me to tell you you're putting her out of work. [WEAKLY] How you doing, kid? Oh, I'm great, I'm fine. I like getting out of the house and driving 200 miles without sleep. So what happened, Morty? I missed. Yeah, why didn't you tell me, huh? I would have sat with you, got drunk with you, whatever. I mean, this is just crazy, that's all. Hey, you listen to me, Morty. Whatever you need, a place to stay, talk, you got it, you understand? Because you're going to be alright, you're going to be fine. Listen to me, don't talk, just listen... I've been doing very bad things. Cocaine, a lot of it. I want you to go home now. I'm okay. There's a place I can go. It'll take some time, but I can beat it. I don't believe it. It's not that dangerous, people are taking this stuff all over the place. You sure it's not... Depression or something? [WHEEZY LAUGH] Not now, Eddie. I'm tired. [HUMMING] Keys. Oh. BRUCE: Eddie.Hey there. BRUCE: Eddie I want you to meet Jack Brayler. Eddie, it's a pleasure, come on board. Hope you didn't have any trouble finding us. Couldn't miss it. Eddie, I'd like to have you meet my wife, Toni. Hi.How are you? Sit down, sit down. Thank you. Bruce says you're absolutely fabulous at finding great property. Eddie's got a talented nose. [CHUCKLES] We sail down several times a year to see Toni's mother. We'd like something near the marina. Say, about 700,000? 700? That's terrific. Marina's a great place, water, boats. Toni, I bet you like to cook, huh? Glass and wood, architect design. Huh, am I right? He's absolutely psychic. Isn't he psychic, Jack? Eddie, how about some wine? Sure. Bruce, stay aboard. Enjoy the air. Thank you again.Ah, my pleasure. Ciao. Jerk! Inherits ten million dollars, can't add two and two. Tough life, huh?Yeah. Well, thanks for the lead that's another one I owe you. El supremo. From Peru to you. Friend of mine is holding almost a pound. I've taken five ounces on consignment. No thanks, I... I've been getting these headaches. Washed your nose out? Not as much as I should, I guess. Try using one of these. You don't want crystals hanging around on your septum. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] What are you suffering for? [SNIFFS] Yeah, alright. Could have been getting down, lately. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] Ohh. [LAUGHING] You aren't kidding. How much? Expensive. But it's an ounce or nothing. I can't take the risk of having that much stuff laying around my apartment. I got people lining up for this. 2800 the ounce. Oh, come on Bruce, don't make it a national debt. I don't mind a gram once in a while, just for recreational purposes, but you know, I'm... This is not really a serious thing with me, just something to get me over the hump. Sure, I know, but... You gotta treat it like paper towels, it goes on sale, you buy in quantity. The Soconian money, that's in T-Bills. I got an escrow closing in two weeks, huh? I can't hold it for you, Eddie. I don't want you to do anything that you don't want to do. I'm just trying to be your friend. I'll replace the money in two weeks. If it's that good, it'll last twice as long, huh? Right, you're right. TELLER: There's a forfeit of 90 days interest, Mr. Gant. I'll replace the money in a couple of weeks. Well, our rates may go down. So, what is it, your money? Your money or your wife? Hey, Ed.[LAUGHING] Hey, you look great! How's the arm?Oh, I look like hell. The arm's fine, this thing comes off next week. I'm getting through it, you know. The Jackie thing finished? Yeah, probably boogalooing around the world. [CHUCKLES] Uh, look, Eddie, um... I want to get together with you, I want you to know what happened up there. I've been a very foolish man.Yeah. Alright, I know, it's okay. Lot of people feel strange when they know someone's a druggie. Well, that's a stupid word, Mort. You fell for a chippy, she turned your head, I understand that, everybody does. Ah, see... I tried to blame Jackie, but she was just the tip of the iceberg. It was me. It was me all the way. Look, I'm seeing a shrink here in the building, please, we'll get together and we'll talk? Yeah, yeah anytime, any day we never close. Terrific! Only getting personal, but you got something going on the side here? What are you talking about? What are you talking about, look at this bank roll. An escrow fell through. What's all the questions for, Mort? You know what I do for a living. Hey, hey, I'm only kidding. Yeah, well. I get a little uncomfortable with all this cash. Talk to you later, Morty. Looking for some suntan lotion, we're going to the beach. I gave you money, buy your own. Okay, I'm sorry. I just don't like you coming in here and borrowing things without asking.I said I'm sorry. You're going to the beach or not? Is everything okay with you and Mom? Yeah, everything's fine. Have I done something to tick you off? I mean, no one can talk to you lately. If it's me, I want to know, so I can keep doing it. Joke, Dad. Buddy, I've got a king-sized headache, I'm late, you're missing four-foot waves at La Jolla. Listen, Bruce, I gave you a large sum of money. Don't tell me "in a couple of days", it's been over two weeks now. I can't afford to run out of steam. Well of course, I can do without it, it's just that everything is coming down on me, that's not the point, I gave you the money. Tonight? Well, why didn't you say so? I'll talk to you later. Eddie, you see the top board? The Marco deal put you over the top, you're the new numero uno. Yeah, so you thought you'd come around and congratulate the old man, huh? Oh, come on, Eddie, I'm being a friend with you. And who do you think is standing in the wings, waiting for me to fall on my face? Hey, come one, Eddie, know what you and Bruce are into. Listen, you better ease off, and get to a doctor, fast. You're the one that better see a doctor. When I get through with you, there's gonna be nothing left! Can you believe that guy? ROBIN: It just goes against my grain. You're getting what you want for nothing. Am I? What do you think, Eddie goes home and weighs this? I don't like you turning him on to so much at one time, he doesn't understand what he's getting into, he's not handling it. Oh, come on, Rob, he's handling. Put him onto eight solid leads, he brings home four. You know what kind of record that is? I want you to tell him that your source dried up. I don't care, you just tell him anything, he's not a casual tooter. He's into it too heavily, he's doing too much and it's costing him a fortune with you. Believe me, he can afford it. When he wants to stop, he'll stop. You sound just like a dealer. Don't you ever call me that. I am a business man and this is part of doing business. Grow up, okay? [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] Can I get you something?No, I'm in a hurry. Better late than never. Seems like so little for so much. It's the job done, it's top quality. Now I've got to hit the road. Stay and have a taste?No, I'll take a rain check. Can I get you something, you're getting so thin. No, you want a hit? Let's not, huh? I mean you can overdo a good thing. You sound like my wife. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] Good toot? Mmm. [BOTH LAUGHING] He was speaking Chinese. And you had him running around trying to show him the house. I was trying to describe romantic dinners on the veranda. [LAUGHING] They were... They were running around, jabbering, like I was the invisible man. [SNIFFING] Oh, Eddie, don't. You've got nice hair. Oh. I like you very much. You're a nice man. You're my friend. But I'm married. Yes, you're very married. And right now, I'm very loaded. [LAUGHING] Yes! So am I. Why don't I go into the kitchen, I'm gonna make us a salad. Hey, Rob, I'm not hustling, it's just that... My wife isn't into this stuff. Two people on the same wavelength, that... That could be spectacular. You're a very sweet man, Eddie. You really are. But it's not love, it's the drugs. There's a big difference, believe me. I want you to promise me that this is gonna be the last time that you have any dealings with Bruce again. I want you to promise me that. Hey, the rough spot's almost over. Couple of months, I'll slow down, okay? I don't really need it. Goodnight, Eddie Gant. [OPENS AND CLOSES DOOR] Come on Eddie, in or out? Umm... You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Deal me out, I have to go to the john. [SCOFFS] Between these two guys, you could lower the water table of Greater San Diego. Five bucks says Eddie will make an even nine visit before 10:30. [BOTH LAUGHING] Hey, where the heck is everybody going? I'm going to my car to get some dental floss, I got popcorn in my teeth. Pick a card, any card. Go ahead. Hey, Morty! Next? How much you doing? "Doing"? You're buzzing so loud I can hear you. Hey, I got a little urinary infection, you know. Doctor gave me some pills.Sure. You got allergies, you got a head cold, you're taking diuretics. Come on, Eddie. I've used all those excuses, I've used some you haven't heard of. I don't know what you're talking about.You don't huh? You think I don't know what's going on, Eddie? I was writing prescriptions for pharmaceutical cocaine, I was hitting 10, 15 times a day with Jackie, without Jackie. Patients complained they thought I was rambling. Well, I thought they were crazy. Eddie, because I was incredible. I mean, I was 20 years old again, all eight cylinders, you know. Hey, hey, look Morty. Listen to me, you idiot!Shhh... You know what I did up there? I locked myself up in a room, and I smoked free base 30, 40 hours at a stretch. There was no sleep, no thinking, no nothing. I didn't want Jackie, I didn't want my kids, I didn't want my ex-wife, I didn't want anything. I wanted cocaine! You want to wind up like me? Come on. Hey, Morty, I'm not into it that heavy. I feel great. You feel great? You always feel great in the beginning. I tried to kill myself. Me. Mister middle class, I had my stupid toe on the trigger of a riffle. Eddie, it gives so much, but it takes, and it takes, and it takes! How about your nose, soreness, bleeding? So my nose is a little sore. I don't wash it like I should. Barbinol? A buddy? You figure it out? Good. How are you doing with them? Are you uptight? You're paranoid? You're short tempered? Hey Eddie, how's your sex life? How's that going? That's one thing about coke, huh?Oh, hey. I mean the Superman syndrome. Eddie, three weeks I couldn't touch Jackie. She didn't leave me. I pushed her out. Don't you get it? I loved it. I loved it Eddie, it was all I could think about. And I still think about it. So much I want to scream. Eddie, it'll kill you! It'll kill you!Don't you tell me what's right for me! I'm not you. I'm not some kind of an addict. I'm a husband. I'm a father. I provide for my family. I didn't, I didn't leave them, shack up with some bimbo. What do you think I am, anyway? You're a drug abuser. Just like me. Hey! Are we playing poker here or not? Who's dealing? Eddie? Come into bed, it's late. I found a letter in Buddy's drawer when I was putting his socks away. It was a letter of acceptance from Stanford. Three weeks old. He's eighteen, he can mess up his own life if he wants to. You sound like you're just writing Buddy off. Oh, no. It's my fault, I... It's nobody's fault. But he just needs room, time to grow up. Are you really tired? You're wide awake now. Eddie. [MOANS] [ALARM CLOCK BUZZING] Come on, cut it out! Can't get you going in the morning. Obviously at night either. What's that supposed to mean? I kinda liked it when it was gray. When are we gonna talk about the insane schedule you're keeping? About Buddy? About anything that doesn't have to do with selling houses and making money. If you don't like the money, don't spend it. If I hear you say "money" one more time, Eddie, so help me I'll scream. Honey. I want you to see a doctor. I need some answers, Eddie, and so do you. We don't make love for a couple of days and you got me ready for the funny farm. I didn't say that. But now that you've brought it up, your couple of days has been over three weeks. Is it me? Is there another woman? Barbara, where's my shaver? BARBARA: I let Buddy borrow it. [CHOKES] [CHEERING] This is only the beginning, right? From here, we're going up, up, up. Hey, Eddie, wait a minute. Hey the corporate boys are really aware of you. It's not final but they need a guy to take over the L.A. operation. Now it's between you and Tad Voss. I'm pushing for you!That's great. I hand a guy Beverly Hills and Bel-Air and all he can say is it's great? Oh, my damn sinuses are killing me. No, it's terrific, Dan. It's terrific. Well, look. They'll be here in 20 minutes. Now take something for the sinuses. Yeah. [PHONE BUZZES] I told you to hold the calls. Hose time, killer. Let's go eat them alive. [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] Okay, now we know that the L.A. market is not that different, just a little more glitter. They want first class treatment that's all. I can show twice as many listings in half the time. Half the time! I put the method together down here, it'll be twice as effective up there. Twice as effective. What are you looking at? You think I can't cut it? You think I'm not telling the truth? It'll be twice as effective up there.[INDISTINCT] Eddie, it's bleeding, your nose. I'm sure Eddie didn't realize. Hey! Don't tell me I didn't realize. It's infected. Anybody will tell you that, any doctor will tell you that. It can happen to anybody. What the hell are you looking at? Step outside with me for just one minute, please. What's the matter with those people, they've never seen a nosebleed before? Are they in this business or not? I've tested it and I can do twice as many listings in half the time, you know that, you've seen me?Shut up. What happened between you and Tad in the hallway, I'll let it go. No I don't know if it's head trips or drinking or what, but you're not screwing me up on this deal. As far as I'm concerned, we're even. Oh, come on!You got a problem, pal. Solve it, or you're out. What are you doing home? Contrary to popular opinion, I live here. We haven't seen you for dinner or anything. You okay? You look lousy. I'm fine. What's with her? That's not a "her", that's your mother. Excuse me. I don't go through your things, I was gonna wash your sweatshirt and I found it in the pocket. I don't wanna know what it is. And I don't want to know where you got it, I just want it out of here. You want to tell us where you got it? Do I have to smack you in the mouth to find out? You think that you're...Stop it! I don't want to know! You're an athlete! Why are you mixing yourself up with dope? I was holding it for a friend. I don't want to hear this. I don't want to know if he's lying or not. I just want it out of this house! So who's your friend? Howie? Hmm? What the hell is the matter with you? You know what that stuff can do to you? You should know. What does that mean?It's yours! From the shaver case. Really something you know, big hot shot salesman drives a Cadillac with a telephone. That's enough, Buddy. Yeah, you know what you're doing? Shoving that junk up your nose? They teach us about it in junior high now. Like they cut that stuff with speed, lidocaine... Keep your voice down, please. Oh, sure. Let's whisper, 'cause Dad's got a drug problem, and we don't want to talk about it. But let it be Buddy, and everyone's screaming! I mean his old man is an upstanding citizen! [SHOUTING] And you're setting an example for me right? Please, Buddy. Did you think I was gonna really use that garbage? Christ, Dad. I figured Morty was hitting on something, but you? I mean I find this stuff in your shaver case, I couldn't believe it! I mean, who am I gonna talk to? You had enough stuff there to stone the basketball team for a month! You're pathetic. Eddie, it's after... Oh! No work today? No, I decided to take a couple of days off. Oh, thank God. You've been going a hundred miles an hour. Listen, Eddie when can we talk about Buddy, this whole thing with the drugs? Oh, it belonged to a friend of his, I checked. Still, it worries me. Aren't you gonna eat something? No, I'm late. I don't know who to worry more about, you or him? See you tonight. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Oh, Bruce? No, no, no. I'm fine, just... Just taking a few days off, that's all. Braylers? When? Today? Oh, forget it. No, forget it. I tell you, Bruce, my sinuses are really... They're really messed up, they're just really giving me fits. Well, tell him that I'll see him some other time! How the hell do I know that? Three more days to get to pick up for the rest of the year! Gant! You look like an old lady, pick him up! Pick him up! Go, go, go! Buddy, I've got to talk to you about... Yeah? Well, I don't. I quit. Cold. I won't buy anymore, I won't take anymore even if it's offered to me. Yeah, I've heard that one before. Oh, you're so lily white? Big jock, you never drink. Never, never does anything out of line. I've never said I didn't do anything. There's more drugs around the school campus than you can find out on the street. You'd have be from outer space to avoid it. I don't do drugs because I made a choice not to. Oh, Buddy, please... Understand that I was under incredible pressure to perform. Incredible. I've had to put my name on the board, you've got to score. You've got to score. What the hell do you want from me? You want me to tell you that it's alright, that I don't care what happens to you? What am I saying? You're supposed to tell me! You're supposed to be the father. BUDDY: Dad? I want to talk to you. Now I don't want to argue, Buddy. I just... I don't know what to do for you. I've seen guys get strung out, you know and, you try and talk to them, and... When that doesn't work you just stop hanging around with them. I can't do that with you. I can't just stop hanging around with my father. [CHUCKLES] I swear to you, Buddy, it's over. It's over. I can be poor on welfare, but never again with this stuff, never. Can you do it, I mean, alone? How about Mom? Have you talked to her? No, Buddy, please. I don't think she knows yet. So let me try it alone. Okay? Huh? If it's too hard for me, I'll... I'll go for treatment. I swear to you. Promise. Dad, I love you. I just want to help you. You already are, Buddy. Oh, God. You are. [REWINDING VOICEMAIL TAPE] Eddie, Bruce again. Listen, the situation has changed, Jack Brayler called back, Toni's mother is sick and they're looking for a permanent place down here. A biggy. A mil, maybe two. They want you to find the listing. They'll be at the Del Coronado on Thursday. Once in a lifetime, Eddie. Take it or leave it. [DISTORTED VOICE] Biggy. A mil, maybe two. They want you to find the listing. Once in a lifetime, Eddie. Take it or leave it. Well, hello stranger, you must have gotten my message. How did the meeting go? I want you to spot me one last hit to get through this. Eddie, you let me down. What happened to the ounce? Fell in the toilet. Accident. Everything? Yeah. You must have died. Look, I don't keep anything here. Well, you must have a friend that I could call. What the hell do you mean talking to me like that? I'm not some back alley dealer shooting up clients. Look, if you can't handle the Braylers there's always Tad Voss. Hey, hey, hey!Alright, alright. You're a little strung out. [SIGHS] Tell you what I'll do. Call Jack, I'll tell him you had a showing and that you'll meet him tonight at 6:00. I'll be at Robin's after work, meet me there. Good. Good. It'll cost you 500. 500? My bank closes in 10 minutes, I'll write you a check. Eddie, you know me, strictly cash and carry, some of my people are very unreliable. I'll give it to you tomorrow. Eddie, it's policy. You must have some money laying around somewhere, somebody you can borrow from? You got to help me, I'm only asking you one last time. Eddie, I just gave you a million dollar deal. I'll see you later. [RINGS DOORBELL] Eddie, go away. Is Bruce here? He was supposed to meet me. Eddie I want you to leave. Go! Wait a minute, what happened, what's wrong? They arrested him. I was waiting for him in the parking lot and they arrested him. Who? Who arrested him? I warned him so many times, he was carrying almost an ounce. He's straight, he's a banker, he can't be arrested. Oh, Eddie, don't be so stupid. Go and look it up! Possession with the intent to sell is a federal offense. You can get up to 15 years in prison. He's going to jail. Bruce is going to prison. What did you think, it was a free ride? Rob I know this sounds crazy, but I... I need a little to get me over a rough spot, can you lend me? [CRYING] Eddie, I want you to go away! [ROBIN SCREAMS] I'm not gonna hurt you. This is the biggest deal of my life, I got to get through it. I need it one last time. There isn't any! There's gotta be some round here someplace. Eddie... I'll pay you back, I swear I will! Look, I flushed it down the toilet, would you please go away? Eddie, go away! Eddie! No, please! What did you do with it?You're hurting me. [SHOUTING] What? What did you do with it? I threw it away! Eddie, don't. You're sick. [CRYING] Plastic bag? Eddie! We wondered where you got to today. Oh, it's that car, wouldn't go, wouldn't work. Expensive car like that. Pow, it goes dead. Wouldn't go, it's crazy. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine, so what was it, your mother, Jackie... What was that? Who's that out there? Why don't you sit down? Yeah, why don't you sit down? Hey, I don't need to sit down. Why don't you sit down, I'm fine. Gotta a nice place here, what do get for a room like this? A hundred, two hundred? Jack, why don't you see if Eddie would like a cup of coffee or something? Yeah sure, how about... Hey, what are we doing here? Are we buying and selling? What is that back there? You've got somebody watching me? What's going on out there? Why are they hiding? I know you're in there! Open the door! Sit down! I know what you're talking about. I know what you're talking about. I know you... You think I'm not good enough for... Oh, it's so hot. [GASPING] TONI: Do something, Jack, please! JACK: Toni, call an emergency ambulance! Toni, quickly! Bring him in, keep that bag on. Okay, let's get an IV line going right now. Pull him over, easy. Set up on pressure.Get this out now. I need the monitor. Get those IV lines in, now! Pulse is present. Pupils equal and reactive, you're allowed to clear, neurologically, looks good. Don't see that monitor yet. [MEDICAL STAFF CHATTERING] Eddie... OFFICER: You have to stay out of here, ma'am. Would you come with me? DOCTOR: Why won't anyone give me a reading here? I need two IV, two IV lines. Pupils equal and reactive. Neurologically, looks good. Mom! Was he in an accident? [SOBBING] I don't know, nobody will tell me. Somebody called me from a hotel. Why won't somebody talk to me? Doctor? You're the wife?Yes. Take 24 hours, the worst has passed. What was it, a heart attack? No, not a heart attack per se. The dose wasn't lethal, just stupidly massive. Too much causes apnea. It's like respiratory failure, so people it happens to, others nothing. They all underestimate the drug, who knows with cocaine. What did you say? Your husband shows symptoms of cocaine poisoning. From the look of the septum, he's been using a while. Frankly, I'm surprised he didn't know he was overdosing, he should have known better. You're a liar! You're a damned lousy liar! I'm sorry, I lost my bedside manner 15 hours ago. This isn't my first O.D. tonight. He should be okay. His system just couldn't assimilate that much coke. He was lucky. You related to him? He's my father. This was in his jacket when I brought him in. Doctor had no choice. He's required by law to report drug O.Ds. This will have to be taken and booked for evidence. You'd better call him a lawyer. Sorry, kid. You knew, didn't you? Why didn't you tell me? That night at the table? It wasn't your drugs, it was his. [MONITOR BEEPING SLOWLY] Oh, please, don't look at me. I'm so ashamed. I'm so ashamed. BUDDY: It's alright, Dad. You'll be alright. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. BARBARA: Don't try to talk, honey. JUDGE: In light of your guilty plea, Mr. Gant, and no prior criminal record, I'm rescinding the term of two years to probation. And a mandatory drug rehabilitation program. I'm also placing upon you a fine of $5,000. You will report to your probation officer twice a month. And submit to a random urinalysis. Any further involvement in drugs and alcohol, I'll remand you to the custody of the San Diego police department. Do you understand the court's order, Mr. Gant? I do, your Honor. Thank you. Thank you very much. That's all, Mr. Gant. [BANGS GAVEL] Barbara. I never thought that I was doing anything that was bad. Until it was too late. Eddie, I'm scared. So am I. I just... [SCOFFS] [SIGHS] I just got lost. I thought... I didn't believe in myself anymore. I just thought that... I didn't matter. Forgive me? Excuse me. No. It's alright. Stay. I'm sorry, Buddy. It's okay, Dad. I just want you to know, that... That I love you. I love you both very much. [BOTH CRYING]
