LITTLE FERGIE THE TRACTOR MAKES A NEW FRIEND Many years ago there were many small tractors on farms the world over. In Norway this popular tractor was called Little Fergie. And those little Fergies made farmwork simpler and a lot more fun. Fergie took over from the horse, and was popular even outside working hours. But after many years of faithful service, Little Fergie's farm work came to an end. Bigger, stronger tractors came to the farms. And they grew in numbers and became bigger and stronger... Much stronger. And seriously tough. So Fergie was left to rust at the back of the barn. There he stayed for many years until some scrap merchants, there to clear out the junk, saw him standing there. They wanted to take him, cut him up, and sell him in small pieces to earn money. Thankfully Gramps discovered what was about to happen. So they had to leave without Little Fergie. They tried to take the tractor with them. Fergie came out of the barn again to Gramps's great delight, and right away he began to tell stories from when he and Fergie worked together. You just stand here and enjoy the moment, Fergie. Enjoy it. We have to go in now. -That one's a real beauty. -Yes, it looks so good... Now Fergie drives around the farm, helping out as best he can. And no one can tell that he's driving all by himself. Fergie loves the farm, enjoys being with his friends. Here chickie chickie! Well, don't you look just great, Fergie! Yes. Good bye Fergie. We should go in, Fern. What in the world? Gramps has gone and forgotten to shut the henhouse gate. Again! Just as well they've got me to keep an eye on the farm! There. Just as it should be. What in the world? Where has Fergie gone? He was here a moment ago. So you're here, Fergie? For a moment I thought the scrap merchants had taken you. And you're here! Yes, and it's lovely! I'm lucky to have a good friend like Farmer Georgie looking after me. But being the only living machine can be a bit lonely. You're big enough to drink coffee now. If only I could drive over to them and show them I'm alive. But I can't. Imagine if everyone found out there was a living tractor on the farm. There would be chaos! Oh, look! A living tractor! Look! The farm would never be the same. If I just blow a little with the fan... I wish I had a friend just like me. But I don't think there are that many living machines out there. Uncle George, who used to live here, had plans to make all sorts of strange machines. Fortunately it was just the postman, not the stupid scrap merchants. Hello, postman! Do you have any post for me today? -Of course I have! -That's good. Just the usual, then. But Gramps... Are you all ready for the great market? I certainly am! So Fern is fussing around sorting out her vegetables. I was twanging my guitar to make a song for the music competition. -Let's hear it, then. -No... It's not ready yet, so I can't. But this year there'll be way more than in the past. There are animals and food and the tractor parade and all that stuff. They'll give a priZe for the best invention shown at the market. Know what? We should tell Farmer Georgie. He's always up to something. Enough to make a poor fellow's head spin. Thank you, postman. So, the market. There's a big veteran tractor parade too with all the big, old impressive tractors taking part. If only I could take part! But saints preserve me! Has war broken out, or something? Now that is just terrible. With a bass drum and trumpet, you'd have a complete band. Yes! Hey! Maybe I could help you with that song. I'll let you know, Fern, if I think I need help. But that's not really why we're bashing these about. Those stupid birds are eating the berries. And to think I always get so much praise for my berries at the market. -What will we do? -I really don't know, Fern. There is a lot to do on a farm. We won't have time to do anything but chase those stupid birds with these lids. That figure I saw in Uncle George's file... That was a scarecrow! If Farmer Georgie makes it, he can help Fern with the birds and maybe I'll make a new friend. No! It's true! You're going to help nick that tractor! No. I don't want to. It's alive! Lord save us! -That tractor is not alive! -I promise you it is! Something's got into you. You're dreaming! It causes trouble for us every time we try to steal it. I want out. DANCING ELEPHANT LIVING TRACTOR -If that's true... -What? -That the tractor is alive. -It is! -Then it's worth more than ever! -Is it? Of course! People would pay a lot of money to see a living tractor. -Would they? -Yes! We wouldn't even need to work. It's easy money. -I'm a genius! -So am I. Idiot! Finally, money in the bank. And we don't have to work for it. If I just fire up my motor and blow a little with my fan, I'm sure the file will open. -What was that? -I don't know! Come on! Has this old file fallen down here? What's this? Oh, these are Uncle George's inventor's drawings. Look here. Bicycle lawn mower. That's a funny idea. Elbow and knee joints... Look! A fully automatic, electric, self-propelling scarecrow! -Cool! -Could you make one like this? Yes, no trouble! You can make it, and I'll go out and keep the birds away. Yes, that's fine and dandy! Lucky nothing heavy fell on you Fergie. Let's go, then! That upped the pace. Things are getting exciting now. AWFILLY SIRIUS LTD SCRAP MERCHANTS I won't. -Come on! Over there. -There? Shh. It's dark here. Shh, you have to be quiet. Keep close to me. All right? When Georgie wears that mechanic jumper, he means business. I'll need some spanners... That jumper has room for tools and screws and everything. Now we need to find... -Hieronymus? -Yes? Stand straight now! And here's the most important thing! On top of screws and tools, the biggest pocket is for biscuits. Or a packed lunch, as Georgie calls it. When you live in the country there are lots of things to do... Let's see! If you're right that that tin can is alive. Oh no... He didn't see me! A belly full of berries A garden full of flowers A belly full of berries... That was really good, Gramps! That's the way it should be. -What did you say, Georgie? -That's the way it should be! Yes, that's the way! Just like that! That's the way it should be... Now let's see... A belly full of berries A garden full of flowers That's the way it should be Playing and swimming That's how we want it That's the way it should be Maybe there's something we can use here. Let's see... It has to be... Yes, it's identical! He was right! It is alive! Hieronymus! But what in the world is this? When you live in the country There's so much to do There's always lots to sort out on a farm But when spirits get low You can lift them like so For when you're weary and hot It's much better when you've got A belly full of berries A garden full of flowers That's the way it should be Playing and swimming That's how we want it That's the way it should be Jumping in the hay loft Wow, drum solo! That, yes that's the way it should be There! What in the name of holey exhaust pipes are you doing? -Me? -Yes, there's no one else here! -What are you doing? -Shall we dance? Have you lost your mind? Girl stuff! Georgie! Georgie? Georgie! What in the world? -Did I scare you, Gramps? -What? -Did I scare you, Gramps? -What do you think? -So, you were really frightened? -Frightened? Saints preserve me! You mustn't do that kind of thing! It can be so dangerous! No, Gramps! This isn't dangerous! It's just for fun! -Just try and you'll see! -No! -What are you two doing? -Nothing! What's that? That? That's the head of my scarecrow! -And it works really well! -Now, now, Georgie! -Now I'll put it on over here. -Get it away! That tractor is on the floor above us. Come on! Let's have a look! There! How in the world did you manage to build a robot so quickly? It wasn't difficult, Gramps. Uncle George had already made a lot of these bits, you know. So I just had to put them together. I just don't understand why he didn't do it himself. Well take a look at that! Where did you find those clothes? In the chest down in the barn. It's Uncle George's old dinnerjacket. Doesn't it look great? I'm planning to call it Clunky. Come on! There it is! Can you fetch... Hiero... Hieronymus! This is the control panel that shows he's got enough power and stuff. -And stuff? -Yes, stuff. All sorts of stuff! On this remote you can programme in what you want it to do. Tidy up, for example. Or scare birds. -Yes, that would be great, Georgie. -Wouldn't it! And the green lamp is flashing, meaning it's working. -What about the red lamp, then? -The red one? I don't really know yet, but under here you have the batteries. And the power comes from that generator. -You have it all under control? -Of course. There are no problems! But, Georgie? What exactly is this? Well you see, that's a thing that makes sure Clunky becomes smart. If you plug it in to some smart people when you start it up. I thought maybe we could connect it to a really good farmer and stuff. -And then we can connect it to... -Yes, I could always... -...connect it up to me! -To you? That way it'll be really smart! -Could that be dangerous? -Dangerous? No! Imagine having such an amaZingly clever scarecrow! Yes, imagine that... We have to bring it to life! We'll put on these two. On the generator. Then we'll take these two and connect them to the top of that one. -That'll put some juice into it. -That's enough now Georgie! Do that outside. It could spark and that could start a fire here. Yes, you're right. I was about to say the same thing. Best to do it outside, Georgie, due to fire and stuff. Yes, that's fine and dandy, Gramps. Then you can wheel Clunky out while I get some more extension cables. -Aren't you taking that one out? -I am! I'll help you... I'll hold it while you push. It'll be fun to make friends with someone as cheerful as Georgie. -I don't think it looks safe. -No, it doesn't really. -I'm switching on now, folks! -All right! There... Let's try, then. 1... 2... No. 3... 2... 1... Fire! Futt? -Nothing happened, Georgie! -No, there was just a little futt! Actually, I think it futted quite a bit. -May God protect me, Georgie. -Are you all right? -Yes, I'm fine. -You say that, you do. But him... He should have jumped about, waving his arms and legs. -Oh really? -Think I need to change the wiring... Let's see... That one... No. Here maybe? I'm sure you'll get it to work, Farmer Georgie. Let's go in and have some food. That'll help clear your thoughts. Very good idea. Come on, Georgie, and it'll be easier after that. I can help. Gramps once told me that things got all knotted up - - between him and Grandma. And then nothing worked. It's possible that one of the cables has got knotted up here too. So here's where you are! What are you up to? If I just touch it to this one here... -That's mine! -I found it! Oh! That's better! No, I've never seen anything like it! He's moving! You got it to work, Georgie! You are a genius, you are! Genius? -Yes, well maybe I am. -But what are we going to do now? -Do? -Yes? Well... We can... We can start by taking out this. And taking off these. Careful now, Fern! -Well, at least he's polite. -Yes, he certainly is! Let's try that tidy button then. Yes... Then we need something to tidy up. Have we anything... Yes! I have something here. Look at that. Just look. Well I never, I wonder if he'll put it in the dustbin. Let's see if the scarecrow button works then. Come on now! -I'm quite excited. -Oh yes! This is going to be fun. Just watch the birds! Turn on the tidy button, but we don't throw anything on the ground. Yes, that's fine and dandy, Fern! No! Watch out! Come here! My new friend's like a whirlwind! -Move your legs out of the way now! -I'm doing it! He is fast. -What's he going to do now? -I don't know. Did he take both the cans? Georgie, that Clunky, you've made him proper good, you have. He looks great. -I'm quite impressed now. -So am I, basically. What's he going to do now, then? I don't think he knows where he's going. Watch out, Fern! Watch out, Fern! Wow! He really does have a sense of order. Good, then I won't be the only one here. He's a fine one, They should really give you a priZe for him! PriZe, yes! I'd almost forgotten it. This year's market... "Animals, food, tractor parade..." Here it is! "First time this year. Inventing competition!" This year they'll award a priZe for the best idea or invention that makes farming life easier. Great! You love inventing things that make life on the farm easier! Maybe not always. But now, Georgie, now you've made a working self- propelled automatic scarecrow. And I've made a new friend. -So perhaps I could... -Sign you up for the competition! With Clunky, yes! Just what I was thinking. -Shall we go, then? -No, it's not until tomorrow. We need to harvest the berries, vegetables and everything else first. Clunky and I will harvest everything, and you can sort out the other stuff. It'll work out, it will, Georgie. We need the time that's left to sort out everything before we go. Take this so you can have a little look at it. -And tomorrow we'll set off. -Yes, we'll do that! It'll work out beautifully, Georgie! That there Clunky really does look great. But Gramps... That song of yours... -How is it coming along? -Well... It's coming along, Georgie. But we have to help Fern so she can sell all her vegetables as quickly as possible. She just has to help me sing, or things won't go well. Just relax, Gramps. Things work out every year. -They will this year too, you know. -Do you think so, Georgie? -Of course I do, Gramps! -Yes... They have before. You write so beautifully. And you are amaZingly good at singing. It wil work out fine. You're good with lyrics... Clunky really will be fun as a friend. I wonder if he'd like to go for a ride. Yes, go for a ride! Come into the house with me. So you don't rust here in the barn. Imagine that. I've got my own living machine. Wonderful! Right when we were about to have fun! Georgie didn't even say good night! Get me out of here! Hello? Hugo? Hugo? Why are you lying there? Is it breakfast time? When you live in the country There's so much to do There's always lots to sort out on a farm But when spirits get low You can lift them like so For when you're weary and hot It's much better when you've got A belly full of berries A garden full of flowers That's the way it should be Playing and swimming That's how we want it That's the way it should be Jumping in the hay loft Relaxing in the heat A summer full of sunshine It's a feeling you can't beat That's the way it should be -Ship ahoy, captain! -Going to the market this year too? -Yes, have to, you know... -Fergie! You must come and meet Clunky, captain. He's the new scarecrow I've made. He really is fine looking. -Yes, good day, good day. -Good day, good day, Clunky. He is so clever. He can tidy and sweep up, and lots of other things. I think we need to go now, we mustn't be late for the market... -All right, Georgie, see you soon. -That's fine and dandy! No! Moths?! See? INVENTING COMPETITION Attention please... To register for the competitions please see Yngvar. He's sitting at a table in front of the stage. The winners will be announced immediately after the tractor parade and before the evening dance. It'll be the night of the year, people. That was a very big stone. Is Little Fergie OK? Fergie's a tractor, so he'll be OK! But what about Clunky? Just look at that! Look... Take that, Fern. Can you help with... -You come here. -Watch out, watch out Gramps. -What is he about to do? -We'd better stay here and see. He's really good. Watch out! Thank you! He's helpful, he is. That's a great invention, Farmer Georgie. It'll be great to have him on the farm. Georgie, why not enter Fergie in the tractor parade this year? No! We don't have time. I need to find out where I enter our super-fantastic scarecrow in the inventing competition. Come on, Clunky, go in. Watch out. Be careful, Clunky, so you don't fall... Well, Fern. I suppose we'll have to load your vegetables then. I'll just take of my helmet and gloves then I'll get to work. I didn't come here just to stand on my own. I won't be able to see what's going on at the market. If I make sure no one sees me I can take a little tour. And when Georgie sees that I'm not in my place, maybe he'll think the scrap merchants have taken me. Then he'll be scared, and come and stroke my bonnet. Does that mower have a motor? Well, I'm not interested in it. You see I'm after an old one that you push yourself. My husband's gaining weight. He's put on 6 stone now. I can't get his old clothes on him. We have to buy clothes all the time. A bit of exercise would be good. You don't have any of the old ones. -No, I don't. -Well, I'm not interested. Good bye. Come and buy my fresh vegetables here! Fresh strawberries! And eggs! On sale here! I've got lovely shiny strawberries here! Grew them myself! Lots of good things here! Hello! -Can I have some strawberries? -No strawberries today! There are lots and lots of lovely apples here. Anyone buying fresh vegetables and strawberries will get an apple! Completely free! I beg your pardon... Lovely to see you again. I bought vegetables from you last year and was so pleased with them. -How much are your strawberries? -They're 26 kroner. I'd like two baskets. The carrots you had last year were divine. I crunched them like candy. Proper vegetables are important. Two years ago I bought from some- one who shall remain nameless and I received a cucumber so watery that it was unusable. And I went to complain, but she didn't apologise at all. And then my husband said that those sorts are badly brought up. The carrots I got were so long that I couldn't fit them in the pan! -And I have such a big pan! -Nice that you were pleased with... The worst thing was that my husband's boss got food poisoning! Here's an apple! Don't forget it! Thank you for coming! You're welcome! When one goes into a pigsty inside a house then one can't... Yes! Hello! Are you after a new tractor? The new Massey Ferguson. 6476. 160 horse power, six cylinders and automatic gearing. A new tractor would be nice, but I was on my way to enter Clunky in the inventing competition. So we have to go, but I'll come back later. Oh no! Does Georgie want a new tractor too? -Taste the best cider at the market. -Certainly! APPLE DELIVERIES AND JUICE SALES You're entering a fully automatic, self-propelling scarecrow? Yes, his name's Clunky! You could search for years and not find a more fantastic machine! -You're number 3, then. -Fine and dandy. I'll take that, Clunky We must go. Thank you! This is exciting! Just think! Oh... That's... What a rabble! All the tough guys are here. Fordson, Porsche, Fiat, JCB, and a little Ferguson. I never thought I'd meet the whole lot. And all at the same time! We want to remind you people about the tractor parade. When all the veteran tractors on display will drive in a long line through the square, and park on the big field in front of the stage. The scrap dealers? What are they doing here at the market? I"ll find a place where I can hear what those crooks have planned! -I want a hotdog! -Forget it! No hotdog for you until we've got hold of that scrap heap. -We're here to do just one thing. -Eat hotdogs! Find that tractor and nick it! Think we can do that? I don't like this, I don't. That tractor's alive. I know that. I saw that inside the barn. Oh no! They've discovered my secret! But now we're at the market. Yes, and that's good. Because that tractor tried to hide from Georgie. Which means it doesn't want anyone else seeing it's alive either. The other people at the market! It needs to stay calm! Easier for us. I think it's frightening, I do. We'll pull out the battery cable so it can't move. Then we can just tow it away! -Yes! -You go that way, I'll go this way! That's a problem. I can't watch more than one of them at a time. I'll keep an eye on Hugo since he's the boss and makes the plans. Come and sample the world's best juice. You simply must taste it! He really is a bit of a fool! There's another one! -Georgie, have you moved Fergie? -No I haven't. But didn't we park a bit further behind the fence, Gramps? But I don't have time for that. Soon I shall be presenting Clunky. -So I need to get ready! -He's looking great... Nothing's the way it should be. I just wanted to have a friend. Now no one cares about me any more. Not even whether those stupid crooks manage to steal me. Rognmo and Iversen. Good job, boys. A self-built rotating watering intensifier. Hello! Have you sold all your veg now? -Yes, everything's gone. -That's great. So I've signed us up for that music competition. -That's great! -Was it such a good idea? -Come on. Let's sit down. -Yes. But I'm so nervous! So say a big thank you to Rognmo and Iversen. Thanks for doing such an amaZing job, guys. That deserves a round of applause! Don't you think so? Thank you. It's a great pleasure for me to welcome Farmer Georgie! He's going to show us his self- propelled, independently moving fully automatic scarecrow! Off you go, Georgie. Yes, it's working! I'm Farmer Georgie. And this is Clunky. He doesn't just scare birds, he'll do anything you ask him to. I'm quite sure he's the best farming invention since the horse! And when you get one on a farm you don't need any other machines. Farmer Georgie doesn't need me anymore. Who'd have guessed it would end like this? No! I won't have it. Everything was fine till Clunky came along! It's all his fault. What a lot of traffic there is here! Are you nearly done paying? Morning Mr sausage man. You've got the world's best sausages! Lots of ketchup, please. I'm not one for mustard. If my husband comes he'll say he wants four hot dogs. He mustn't. He's put on five stone. Only his tracksuit trousers still fit. He's never run a yard! His slippers and underpants have got so tight! Half a sausage for full price? Now, shall we scare some birds? Wait a moment. Just like that. So I thought perhaps we could... No, wait, I've forgotten something. I'll be straight back. Now, if you're ready down there, we're ready up here, we are! And in that case, people, let's drive! There you go! Now, let's try to scare some birds. Are you ready, Clunky? OK. Show them that you can scare birds, Clunky. Come on. No! What are you doing? Georgie! I don't mean to be rude, but this looks great. It really does seem to work. You're not taking us for a ride, are you? Walks like a human. It's not some- one dressed up as a scarecrow? Dressed up? No, no, no, what are you doing? Sorry. Forgive me. What are you doing? Now perhaps Clunky's a little less fun. ...and his scary scarecrow. A round of applause, people. Thank you. That was a good show. -It wasn't so bad, Farmer Georgie. -It won't win me a priZe. You should be ashamed! Yes, you should. Georgie, why don't we have a waffle? Yes, or... five! We're nearly ready for the dancing competition up here on stage. What happened to that crook? What are you doing? Listen... Look! The tractor! Sneak forwards, pull out the battery lead, and the tractor will be ours. But we can't just... Hugo! Hugo! You'll get what's coming to you! Oh, thank you! And on the first shot! I'll let him lie in my double bed between my husband and me. The market's tiring, and I'm all in. I need to take it easy. Maybe a cup of coffee or two. -In there! -There are lots of clothes here! Great! Put them on so the tractor won't recognise us. Nice dress! Oh yes! In there! The tractor can't get in there! And I'd like to use the occasion to wish the next competitor... ...welcome. And it's... My name is Hieronymus. What's this all about? And what dance are you going to dance, boys? -Dance? -Tango! -So it's the tango, people! -What are you doing? Get me out of here! -Do you think we'll win? -Win?! -Some practice on that last step... -I'll give you practice! -That tractor can deal with me. -I'm thirsty, I am. Hello? Hello people? The dance competition is over. Would the competitors in the music competition get ready... -But that's us. -Yes, come on, Gramps! -But do we really dare? -Of course we do! No. Sit down again. You've made quite enough of a mess today. You sit there, now! That's too bad! The crooks are getting away... again! We welcome you to this year's music competition. Our first competitors are none other than the Aremark school band! -They're really good, Georgie! -They are, they're great. They won't be easy to beat. Where's my guitar then, Fern? -You put it down somewhere. -I can't find it! I'll go and find it, I shall. Fool! Tthank you to Aremark school band and welcome to the Guitar GeeZers. Hugo! Hugo, look! There it is. A robot like Farmer Georgie made down on the farm. It works. It's alive. Just like the tractor, but it's even craZier. -I think those two are real friends. -Hey, what if we taught it to steal? Yes, then it would be worth much more than a living tractor! -Money in the bank. -And it's much easier to nick. If we take it down to the yard, the tractor follows to save his friend. -Where to? -Our place! The yard! -Two birds with one stone! Brilliant! -Yes, that is... A huge thank you to the Guitar GeeZers! Now it's the turn of Gramps and Fern. Up here is where it happens, Gramps! Shall we all call him? Gramps! Gramps! That's good! Gramps! Gramps! You can hear them calling you! Here he comes! Gramps! We're ready now! -Fern is looking for the guitar... -Is Fern looking for the guitar? You can't do anything without Fern. Can anyone see Fern? There's Fern! Give her a round of applause! There you are, Gramps! One, two, three, four! When you live in the country There's so much to do There's always lots to sort out on a farm But when spirits get low You can lift them like so For when you're weary and hot It's much better when you've got A belly full of berries A garden full of flowers That's the way it should be Playing and swimming That's how we want it That's the way it should be Jumping Jack! -Turn it off! -Where? He's broken. Come on! Lift! Money! Take this jingling heap of scrap! I'll be back soon! Looks like there'll be a record set this year. -Over a hundred thousand kroner. -Wow! But that's great! Fire! Fire! There's a fire! Save the market! Out! There! A belly full of berries A garden full of flowers That's the way it should be Playing and swimming That's how we want it That's the way it should be Jumping in the hay loft Relaxing in the heat A summer full of sunshine It's a feeling you can't beat That's the way it should be So, those crooks have taken Clunky instead of me! Actually, that's fine. It'll all be just like it used to. I think that went well, I do. -Really well! -Didn't it? A belly full of berries A garden full of flowers That's the way it should be Playing and swimming That's how we want it That's the way it should be Hey, Farmer Georgie! I know. That bit with Clunky, that didn't go so very well. It didn't go so badly, did it? The way I've been boasting about Clunky, and then he did what he did. -Everyone will laugh at me. -No one'll laugh at you. Take this! It didn't even work! -Everyone will say... -He made a fool of himself! "...that there inventor idiot!" Everyone will point at me. Don't worry about it, Georgie. What have I done? I didn't mean for Farmer Georgie to be sad. I just wanted to spoil things for Clunky because I was... I was jealous of him. How lovely it would be to have both Clunky and Fergie on the farm! Gramps! Fergie's gone! Look! It's the scrap merchants! They must have taken Fergie! Georgie still cares about me. How could I doubt that? Clunky didn't ask to be made! I wanted him to be. It's all my fault. Da doarah doorah doorah steal! Da doorah doorah addio oh! Da doarah doorah doorah money-oh Da doorah addio for you and me! I'm a genius! -What am I? -Bog! -We' must find a bog, I need a pee. -Hold it in till we get to the yard! -But I need to go now! -No! I feel sick. Don't be sick in the car! I'll stop. AWFILLY SIRIUS LTD SCRAP MERCHANTS SAUSAGE KRONER 22 It'll be strange buying food and not stealing it. Oh no! He's broken! What if he can't be fixed? I just wanted a new friend. I gave him the electricity to bring him to life. But now I've ruined everything. I'd happily give my right back wheel and my accelerator if only Clunky could get well again. There's life in him! Something's got to be done! That power cable goes right over to where Clunky's sitting. Let's see... That makes 22. Look at that! 600 kroner. Let's see... There you go! Please wake up! It worked! Clunky's alive! Oh no! Hey, hey, hey! Are you planning to pay, or what? -I did pay! -You did, but what about him? He hasn't bought anything. He was in the loo. He did take something. Let's see in his pockets. -Turn them out. -And your coat pockets. We've got to get away. There's chocolate missing. And that leg. Look. Clunky, come here! We need to get away! -What about you? -Me? But someone's taken something! There's something missing inside! Too bad. I knew it! No! Not that way! That's not the way to the scrap yard! Clunky had fainted away when he arrived here. I must show him the way back. Come on, Clunky. Follow me! -What in the world? -It's the scrap merchants, Georgie! POLICE STATION DAD POLICE Hugo! Hugo! Don't fall off! Take my hand! Hold on! What do I do? If I drive to the market everyone will see - - I'm doing it by myself, but if I turn off, Clunky will follow. And those crooks must be revealed once and for all! There's only one thing to do! -What's going on here? -They've stolen our moneybox! -A hundred thousand kroner! -And they tried to take Fergie! What do you have to say for yourselves? We hope we win the dancing competition! -You're under arrest! -Does that mean we haven't won? Yes. -A living tractor! -Just look at that! It's alive! What on Earth is this? -Actually, what is happening? -How is it to have a living tractor? Living tractor? It's a world first! A living tractor. What are you going to do with it? Living tractor? What sort of nonsense is this, Georgie? Living? No, it's not alive. It can't be. Well, you see, I rebuilt this remote control. Which gave me a super-fantastic self-propelled tractor. So now I'll press the horn button, Fergie. AmaZing! That's our money box. The market has been saved! Thank you! Attention please! Time to award this year's priZes! That's my little Clunky boy! I'm sorry, Fergie. I shouldn't have forgotten you. But you see I so wanted to show that I was a great inventor. And so I forgot that you're my best friend. Sorry. Thank you, Clunky. Well, it really does look as if you've made a new friend. Now for the award for best invention. And it's the first time, ladies and gentlemen, that it's been given. And if we say that it saved the entire market, everyone knows it is: Clunky the scarecrow and his inventor Georgie! Yes, we won! Big round of applause! Welcome! Congratulations! -Congratulations! -Many thanks! Here comes... You take it, Clunky. There you are. As you know, it saved the whole market this year. So just say if there's anything we can do for you! No, I don't think there is, We have what we need, we have. Nothing we can do, they say. -Oh, yes! -Is something going on here? Of course! Of course we can sort that out. No problem! Clunky and Georgie! And now it's my great pleasure to introduce the winners of the music competition. And ladies and gentlemen, it's none other than Gramps and Fern! Have we won? Have we really? Wonderful! You won! Congratulations, Gramps! Congratulations, Fern! -Congratulations! -Thank you so much. A belly full of berries A garden full of flowers That's the way it should be Playing and swimming That's how we want it That's the way it should be Jumping in the hay loft Relaxing in the heat A summer full of sunshine It's a feeling you can't beat That's the way it should be Some people they like this thin9 And some people they like that Some like the larger animals Some a little one like that Some they play all on their own Some with a friend or two But every last one knows There's a feeling you can't beat A belly full of berries A garden full of flowers That's the way it should be Playing and swimming That's how we want it That's the way it should be Jumping in the hay loft Relaxing in the heat A summer full of sunshine It's a feeling you can't beat That's the way it should be Some they cycle, some they run And some they want to walk But every last one of them Knows the feeling you can't beat A belly full of berries A garden full of flowers That's the way it should be Look, Hugo! There's a picture of us in the paper. And it says: "Two stupid scrap merchants were arrested at this year's market when they tried to steal..." We're celebrities! That's the way it should be! Yes, that's exactly The way it should be! It's very nice to go to market, but many things irritate me. I've been trying to talk to people, but it doesn't quite work out. I get interrupted wherever I am. And I'm very good at talking. So I don't understand why they have to interrupt the whole time.
