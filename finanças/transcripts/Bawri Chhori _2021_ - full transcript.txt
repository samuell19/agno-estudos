D E V Encodes Hi, friends. Today, we are going to learn the cheapest way to dispose off a body. The best and the cheapest thing to do is cut up the corpse into lots of little pieces. Good morning. Flight Delhi to London has arrived. Then make the meat pickle out of it. Make sure you use the mustard oil. It has a pungent smell. No one will doubt anything. Another cheap thing to do is feed the meat to the pigs. Pigs can even finish off the bones. Just make sure to remove all the hairs of the dead body and pull the teeth out. Even pigs have a hard time digesting that. You will need at least 16 pigs to finish the job. They will finish off a body that weighs 200 pounds in about 8 minutes. It will be a win-win for you and the pigs. Radhika! Wow! You haven't changed a bit. You still look the same. Why are you speaking in English? O God, what happened to you? Skin-and-bones. That's what they used to call you in school, right? Skin-and-bones, huh? Well, they used to call you Fatso. Yeah, yeah. So, have you got a place to stay? Or you can stay at my place. No, no. You coming here to pick me up is good enough for me. - I'll manage everything else. - Sure? Okay. Should I do service, ma'am? - It's so cold here. - Come. How's your husband? I don't see your family. Are you trying to hide them from me? - I am not married. - What?! Yeah. Why? Is it necessary? By the way, can I find a big knife somewhere here? Yeah, how big? Butcher's knife. Why do you need a butcher's knife? To make a meat pickle. It's my business idea. Yeah, you can find one. - At Tesco. - What is that? - A Supermarket. - Okay. And, are there any pig farms here? Yeah, there are. Why? You know, pigs are extraordinary animals. - You can make pickles out of it... - Hmm. ...and feed the leftovers to other pigs. They can even finish the bones. Isn't that something? Your don't seem to have good intentions. My intentions are good. How are Uncle and Auntie? Have you brought Auntie's Boondi Laddu with you? Do you remember how I used to jump at those Laddus? Look, if you need anything, just call me. Or just drop by. Okay, bye. Hello, Uncle. - Hello. - You're Mr. Bakshi, right? Yeah. How can I help? I needed some important information from you about my Brother-in-law. Actually, he married my sister four years ago. Then he moved here to England and has not been in touch ever since. So I needed information on him. He mentioned you... Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I haven't heard so much Hindi in the last 15 years. Honey, she is new here. Please don't laugh. Oh, sorry. There. English, we love the crockery. Look, lots of people move here from India. Not everyone can manage to stay. But, Uncle, there must be a way to find out. They were not having any problems in their marriage. And they also used to talk often. He would call her at least once a week. And then all of a sudden, he stopped calling and everything. Have you checked with the police? Did he immigrate legally? Laws here are really strict. Would you come with me to the police station? Did she say "police"? Haven't you got that thing you have to go to? - Why would I go with you? - No, sweetheart, no police. No police at all. He's a UK citizen now. He's living here legally. What would you do if your daughter's brother-in-law go missing? - But you are not my daughter. - Doesn't she said "daughter"? - Is she your daughter? - No, I just... Yeah, I am your daughter-like, and we belong to the same country. So? Do you have a... a wife - that you are hiding from me, Darling? - No. Okay, imagine that your daughter's brother-in-law goes missing. I mean, may it never happen, but suppose it does happen, and she ends up in a foreign country looking for him, won't you help her? Come on, chop-chop. - We have to go to that thing. - Oh, yes. - He is so forgetful. - Look... why would my daughter look for her brother-in-law? Where is your sister? Why are you the one looking for him? I don't understand anything. Uncle, just think of me as your daughter. Motherfucker! You Indians are animals, all of you! Don't you even dare speak ill of India and Indians. - Hail India! - Hold... Leave this house this very fucking minute with that little cunt! - Please calm down. - I... Don't touch me! - Get me some motherfucking water, Roko! - Yes. Water is coming, Darling. Please calm down. - Om! - Om. Oh, leave my house now! Leave! I am, I am leaving! You fuckers! Om. Om. - Here. - Sorry. Thank you, Uncle. Uncle, if you don't want to help me, just say it to my face. But please tell me the truth. Don't beat around the bush. If I were living here legally, it would take only 5 minutes. But people even change their name after moving here. Take me, for instance. When I moved here from India, my name was Roshan. And now... Now what? Now I am Roko. Roko! Jesus! Come here with me for a moment. See, I have the diary of my brother-in-law. It has city names in it. Maybe he has moved there from London. He may have, right? Where did you get that? He came to India once and forgot his diary at home. Look, it also has names of some people in it. Here is yours, Roshan Bakshi. There is one more. Someone named Daljit Singh. There is his London address. You must know all the addresses here in London. I am sure you know about the Indians living here, at least. After all, birds of a feather flock... Hey! You pig, stop! Stop, you bastard! You must have ditched you wife too! Oh, my luggage! Hey, Roko, stop! Stop, Roko! Hey, stop! Stop, you bastard! Stop! Stop, you bloody Roko! You also ditched someone, didn't you? You won't get away from me! Sir, sir, an Indian woman is chasing me. I mean, one Indian woman is running behind me. She wants to kill me. Can you please help me? - Where? - Where has she gone? She was just down there. She was following me. I can't see anyone. Bastard! You run really fast for a man of your age. - Where is my husband? - Husband? - I mean, Brother-in-law. Where is he? - Look, I don't know anything, my child. "Child"? Now I am like your child?! You were about to get me arrested, and now you wanna play father, huh? - Spill or I will chop your head off! - Look... You mentioned someone named Daljit, right? - Yeah. - He came by one day and took off with him. That's all I know. I swear, that's all I know. So, you don't know anything useful, huh? Look... when you step out of your home and start knowing the world, everything changes. I may be wrong in someone's view, but I am absolutely right from where I am standing. I am sorry. I couldn't help it. Crazy girl Crazy girl The person you have called is unavailable right now. Please try again later. When I leave things unsaid When I get tired of listening There is a part of you in me That tell me I am really stubborn I am a crazy girl Crazy girl Crazy girl Crazy girl Who is she? Hello. Who are you? What are you doing here? Get up. I'll call the police. Get up! No, ma'am, I... I am from India. I am here to meet Mr. Daljit. - You were also having an affair with him? - Huh? - Or are you here for money? - No, I... I was looking for a man... Men are not allowed in my house. You got the wrong address. Leave. - Get moving. - Ma'am, he... he used to know Mr. Daljit. He mentioned him. Stop saying "Mr. Daljit." I don't want to hear that prick's name, got it? And does the person you are looking for has a name? What? Can I use your washroom? Come in. "Mr. Daljit." Don't use "Mr." for him. Come. Are you a working woman or a housewife? Hello. Welcome to Airtel. My name is Radhika. How may I help you? I did that for two years and earned money to come here. Love marriage or arranged? It was an arranged love. What? Plus, cash in dowry. He married me so he can get money to live it up here. Our parents arranged our first meeting, and we fell in love eventually. You are good with knife. Well, I'm going to meet my husband. You just left it there. Yeah, it's an on-time delivery. She will get it herself. Now, over there. - So, is your son at school? - He is out on a school trip. - Okay. - I can guarantee you he will be trying to open a dog's mouth and count its teeth. - What's his name? - Bharat. So sweet. In the memory of India? If it was in the memory of India, I would have named him India. - Yeah, right. - This way. Okay. If you hated that guy so much, why did you marry him? I didn't want to, my parents forced me. What else was I supposed to do? Making meal for others for money? Marriage is not the answer to loneliness. Sorry. Hi, Tom. - Hey, good morning. - Good morning. - Nice to see you. - How are you? Good, thank you. You are so kind. - Enjoy these, Tom. - Thank you. - Radhika. - Coming. Cheers to virtuous wife, Radhika! So, when did you move here? I was 21. Yeah, 21. He fell in love with me. I used to like him too. Then I thought I was lucky. Moving from Jalandhar to London. So we got married and moved here. For a month, everything went great. Just amazing! Then, I got pregnant. And he started having an affair. What?! He left me stranded in the middle of the street. With his child. 'He didn't even give me money' to go back home. Carrying Bharat in my arms, I got home on foot. And swear to god, that day, I felt like... throwing Bharat off the bridge and jump myself. But I couldn't. I just couldn't. - He never came to see you? - He? No, no, no. I went to see him. His British girlfriend opened the door. And when he came out, he refused to recognize me. It's ju... just like that. How did you manage all this all by yourself? Why are you getting so serious? I would never be able to manage all this if it was me. I swear I couldn't have, Ms. Saroj. - You are very brave. - Oh, no, no. I am no brave and all. Hey. Only a woman can do these sorts of things. I have raised Bharat all by myself. On my own. And I am very proud of myself. And promise me you will never say that you can't do it. If I can do it, you can do it too! - Promise me. - I promise. - Promise. - I promise. Promise. Here. - Listen. - Yeah. - Here, take this. - What's this? Some food. You can't commit suicide on an empty stomach. I will pray that you and your husband go back to India together. Call me if you need anything, okay? Thank you so much. - Bye. - Bye. May God be with you. He used to work here a few years ago. Then he moved somewhere else. I have heard he has started his own business in Oxford. Oxford? Do you any phone number or address of that place? Number... I am not sure, because we never spoke to each other. Maybe Mr. Patel know it. i will get the address. Yeah, yeah... How are you? I want the address. A ledy serching to Abhishek. You can try finding it in here. Maybe he knows? - How far is that place from here? - Just Google it, man.

For a few months, I kept waiting... for him to call me and ask me to come to London. But he didn't. I was so stupid. Don't worry. I will find Abhishek anyhow. Thanks, Anand. You are doing so much for me. Even my own family didn't help me so much. - I swear... - Stop it, man. Why didn't you get married? Marriage... it just didn't happen. Anyway, leave all that.

O my heart Stop for a moment There is a whole other world in dreamland Why are so lost in thoughts Why are you wide awake, O my heart So, Mr. Fatso, it's my last night here. You are such an idiot. If only you could muster the courage to say it. You are a nice idiot. Good night. Good morning. Breakfast is ready. Good morning. Have a seat. I'll get you a fresh one. Okay, so will you have tea or coffee? Tea. With ginger, please. Great! We have quite a similar taste. By the way, I have got the word spread about your husband. I have send all his details to my WhatsApp group as well. As soon as I get any information from a reliable source, you will know. Thank you, Anand. Can I say something? Your husband is a dic... A dimwit. He left a girl like you. It would have never happened if you had married me. Well, I know who used to leave a chocolate at my desk every day. - Oh, yeah? Who? - The Invisible Man. You just disappeared after college. Do you really don't know? Know what? So everyone in the town knows, and you don't? No. What is it? - I murdered someone. - What? It was an accident. You know what a hothead I was. Anyway... Before they could put me in jail, my family sent me abroad. And after a while, I ended up here. And here, I got my second chance. My taxi. Life doesn't give a second chance to everyone. Here it is, Andrews Lane. Call me when you get there. Got the phone number of the Aunt in Oxford? Yeah, Anand. - Bye. - Bye. A smoker can't advise his kids not to smoke. Neither you smoke, nor do you have kids. What's the point? You are right. I don't smoke. So I can advise you, right? Don't make the mistakes that I made. Some mistakes are just... too hard to live with. - Bye. - Bye. Take care. You too. Hello. Hello. Is someone there? Hello, excuse me. Is someone home? Is someone there? Shit. You? What the... - Fuck off, you bitch! - Hello! You too. Did you call the police? Police? Why will call the police? Oh! Well then, off you fuck. But I can call them. What is... Did I sound like an invitation to you? Listen, I don't have any money. So, if you are expecting me to give you anything, - you can... - But I don't want any money from you. Okay. I don't want money, Cheapster. - Then? - I messaged you on Facebook. - About a lift? Oxford? - Oh, right! Bloody thief! Expecting money from you my ass! Bitch! I can understand Hindi. Two hundred Quid. What? - Fine, I will call the police. - Wait! You cunt! I am not some Kant. My last name is Pandey, mind you! Where exactly in Oxford do you want to go? What? Speak slowly. Where exactly - in Oxford... - Sister, sister, English, please. Where do you want to go? To Oxford. Here. A hundred Quid. Plus, damages for the liquor. - You can give the money... - Ninety pounds? A discount of ten pounds. To save you from the police. Okay? Fine. Do you live here alone? I don't think that's any of your business. Where the hell is my bag? How come you understand Hindi? My mom was from India and... Dad wa... is British. Oh, I see. You live with your parents. Are they not at home? Off to work? - They got divorced. - Oh. My dad used to get drunk and... beat my mom. - So my mom... threw away. - Threw what away? - Oh my goodness! How do you say... - What? - Theft. - Theft? - They seperated. She le.. le... - Left him? Your mom left your dad? Yeah, that's what I said. I see. I used to think it happens only in India. You know, my maid... her husband would also get drunk and beat her every day. So, she also... - I mean, I understand. - Right. I'm sure you do. You have experience apparently. Does your mom live alone? Who takes care of her? Does anyone live with her? She died of cancer. Oh! Sorry. It's okay. Do you drink all this liquor? You talk a lot, don't you? You should put some flowers in the flower pot. - It doesn't look good empty. - Oh fuck! What happened? - You are taking the flower pot with you? - Oh, come on! I work in BPO, I make pickle, I do Facebook, I do Instagram. Facebook and Instagram would be very happy to know you are doing them. Right? I can do everything. Here it is. Your car is just as trash as your house. If you don't want a lift, you can leave. No, I do. Let's go. - Seat belt. - Yeah. God, help us! You will get me there in one piece, right? Turn right from here, sister. Right. - Turn right. Right. - Yeah, yeah. This is for your happiness.

What's with the long face then? My agent just called me. And what did your agent say? The contest has been delayed. Man... It is just a delay. It's not like someone has died. What's with the sad face? What's going on inside your head? What are you thinking about? My grandma lives in a town nearby. I wanted to see her. So? That wasn't our plan. You wouldn't mind? Why would I mind? It's your grandma, your wish, why would I have a problem with that? Shall we go then? One condition. - What? - Smile. Okay. I am gonna go get ready. Listen. She is a bit weird. So... just take care of that. I managed to adjust with you. I think I can deal with anyone. Here it is. That's your home? Wow! - It's really beautiful, man. - I know. - I was born in this very house. - Really? I used to come here every year with my mom. Oh my goodness! Best summer holidays ever. I haven't been here in the last eight years. I was homeless for four fucking years, Radhika. I didn't want her to see me like that. I don't think your grandma is home. She is home. I know she is. - You should have called her once. - I don't need to call her. She is... Grandma, finally! Who are you? - I am Anna. - Anna who? - Your daughter. - Granddaughter. Grandsnotter. - Granddaughter. - Oh. - Granddaughter. - My granddaughter died eight years ago. Okay, Grandma. Oh, by the way, this is my friend Radhika. - She is from India. - Hello, Grandma. She is fluent in Hindi and makes tasty pickles. But it's okay if you don't want to talk to us. - Let's go. - Don't just leave yet. Fuddu. What Fuddu? Here, hot Biryani. Tell me how is it? Grandma, here is yours. It smells so great. You have really reminded me of India. I am sure you are an Indian by heart. Are you gonna take it out on food now? No. Are you mad? - Really? - Yeah. Grandma, who are you making it for? After my husband passed away, I took this up as a hobby. He used to gift me all this. That's how I remember him. Okay, I will get myself some Biryani. Have you never heard the story of Shakuntala? Shakuntala? Who is she? When Rishi Durvasa cursed Shakuntala that Dushyanta will forget her, Shakuntala cried a lot. Then Rishi melted and said to Shakuntala... that if she shows Dushyanta any personal token given by him, he will remember everything again. So, Dushyanta remembered everything again after seeing Shakuntala's ring. When your love will remember you again, he will come around on his own. Shall we eat? Yeah, I am starving. You house is really beautiful, man. - Keep quiet. - What happened? Looking for something? - Just keep quiet for a few seconds. - Looking for something? Yes! What is this? - Speak up. - The laughter medicine. The laughter medicine? Let's go. - What is this? - Let's go! - Weed? - Yeah. You smoke... you smoke weed? - O my god! - What if your grandma sees us? - No one is gonna see. Come on. - You are crazy. - What? - Try it. What... - Take a drag. - No, I can't. - No, no. - Oh, come on! Try. - It won't kill me, right? - You will love it! What the hell is this? This is terrible! It's not terrible. - Wait, wait. - You enjoy. Watch, watch, come on! Simple, come on. - I know you can do it, but I can't. - Yes, you can do it too. Beautiful. Oh my goodness, you are adorable! Did you like it? I did it. Your grandma turned out to be damn cool, man. And at this age! At this age, no one cares about what people are gonna say. You are absolutely right. We are idiots to always worry about what people are gonna say. Give it to me. Who cares about people? No one even knows me here, right? - No one! - No one! I will do it. Yeah! Exhale. It is really a laughter medicine. I know why you are here. I saw the knife in your bag. I am saying this from my experience. Don't throw your life away for a man. No matter what, life goes on. - Hello, Anand, hello. - Hello, Radhika. Hello, can you... can you hear... - Hello, yeah, I can hear you. What is it? - Yeah. Actually... we have found Abhishek. - Okay. - He has... married someone else in Oxford. Grandma, I have been calling you. Can't you hear me? Grandma, we have to leave. Grandma. This is not funny. Come on, Grandma. Grandma. Radhika, that's just an information that I found. I will WhatsApp you his exact address. Anand, I will call you back. - Radhika, are you okay? - Grandma. Grandma. Grandma! Radhika! Get here, right now! Anna? Anna. What happened? Grandma, I don't understand. - What happened? - She isn't responding. - She doesn't seem to have pulse. - Grandma, grandma! - Grandma! - Grandma! - What to do? Grandma! - Grandma, wake up! Grandma! Call an ambulance! Grandma! That's Radhika. She grew very close to my grandmother. Thank you so much for coming, by the way. To pay my respects to Grandma's love for Hindi, I shall share my thoughts and memories in Hindi. So... bear with me. Grandma used to say, "Child, always be real." "My child, always be yourself." If you won't love yourself, you will not... - keep... anyone to love you. - Find. Sorry. You will not find anyone to love you. If you will not love yourself, then no one else will. To think inside a box is the reason death happen. Think out of the box. Whatever you do... don't forget to bask in it. Death happens when you think... inside the box. So... think outside the box. Live life and... Man, even I don't know what "bask in" means. Basically, just whatever you do, don't forget to have fun. Don't forget to enjoy. Thank you. - Radhika. - Hmm? Do you know who I talked to in Hindi the last time? To your mother. I miss her. What happened? I know you miss your mother a lot. Yeah, but, why are you crying? You are crying too, but you are not showing it. You should cry. It will lighten your heart. Cry. Come cry with me. - What? - Just cry with me. - Cry, cry out loud. - Are you serious? Fine. Beat your chest. Harder! No one is hearing us. Cry out loud. Louder! How are we going to go to Oxford now? We spent all our money on the memorial service. Wait here, I'll be right back. - Hi, ya. - Hi, ya. - You all right? - Yeah, not too bad here. Can you see that car over there? - How much for that beauty? - A hundred Quid. Are you kidding me? No. - Four hundred. - Four! Are you mad? You crazy? God! Look, I've got about four other cars there. It's perfectly fine. Get your stuff. We will go by bus. By bus? - Why? - I'll explain later. - There you go. - Let's deal with him first. - Thank you. - Keys. - I will. - Enjoy! Mr. Daljit. Do you eat Paranthas? What kind of Punjabi wouldn't eat Paranthas? My ex-wife used to make it. Many years ago. - Why? - Actually... - the thing is... - What is this? Stupid! What's that for? Have it. - Idiot! - You idiot! - Here? - Yeah. Perfect! Thank you so much. - Lovely to meet you. - Yeah. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Thank god he dropped us here. - Or we couldn't have made it to here. - Yeah, I guess. Anyway, so this is it. How do you feel? Happy. - Excited. I don't know. - What will you say to him? - I will stab him with this a couple times. - What the fuck! I will kill that bastard! What the fuck is that! This is the tool to make him pay for his sins. - What? - It's an instrument. Have you lost it? - Why? - Why? You will end up in prison. Why are you destroying your life because of him? I don't care. "Don't care." Fuck him! Make something good out of your life. Look, I am doing what I know. I am gonna need your help. Help? In your stupid plan to get revenge? Hell no! Fine. I will kill him on my own. I don't need you help. Fine! You are fucking insane, man! Pigs can even finish off the bones. You will need at least 16 pigs to finish the job. They will finish off a body that weighs 200 pounds in about 8 minutes. This? This Youtube video is what you counted on and came to London? - It's a great plan, isn't it? - Great?! I knew that you are the only one who would understand my feelings. You know, when I meet that bastard, I will tear him apart - and cut him into tiny little pieces... - Shut up! I will have to think of something. We know that this is Rocky's, I mean, Abhishek's house. Every Wednesday, at 6 PM, he lies to his vegan wife and goes out. Then, at 7 PM, he goes to a pub with his friends to get beer and pork. - He's here. - Bye. At 8:30 PM, he goes right behind that pub and smokes cigarette in secret. When he drops the cigarette, that will be our green signal. And that's when we can kill Abhishek. - Absolute bullshit. - What do you mean? That area is crowded. We will have to kill him somewhere no one would expect. Where? In his house. In his house? I will kill that asshole right in front of his wife. Are you mad? You can't do that. I will chop his head off! - How? - I will do that. I will! I will cut him into little pieces, make pickles out of it - and take it in a jar! - You need a plan to do all that. My plan is really good. What are you looking at? - Come. - Where? Are you sure? Just have a makeshift ready before I get back. What is a makeshift? That guy weighs about 80 kg. It's not like we can carry him ourselves. Right, yeah. - All right. - You will manage that, right? Wait. What happened? You know, right? No matter what... I am with you. Go. Jai Mata Di. That! Yes? - Hi. - Hi. Is Rocky in there? Yes. Who should I say this is? An old friend from India. Okay. Come in. - Can I? - Please. - Thank you. - You are welcome. Take a seat. - Would you like any tea, coffee? - No, no, thanks. - Little water? - No, no, thanks. Okay. It's my child's birthday. Okay. I will just get Rocky for you. Susan, where is the duct tape? Can you pass it, please? Abhishek. Rocky. Radhika! You! Okay. - Now what? - Why have you tied me up? Am I supposed to honour you? Revere your moon-like face through a sieve. Don't be mad. You have abducted me. - You won't get away from the police. - Shut up, motherfucker! Fucking asshole! It just took you a fair-skin to ditch me. You married her, man. How do you even have the goolies to talk back? - What are goolies? - Balls. - Right. - Hey, you seem sensible to me. - Do something. - What would I do? You deserve it. Look... this girl is mentally retarded. She is highly unstable. Believe me. She gets in a vengeance mode over any little thing. - She is dangerous. - He is lying. Like what? Like... she punctures the tires of the vehicle. - Mixes a laxative in the tea. - What? He is talking nonsense. Yeah. Medicinal misuse for the purpose of loose motions. - That's it. - She would do that every day! One day, I said we should consult a psychiatrist. Hell, the loose motions I had that night! Then his dad would call and say, "My daughter is not insane. If you take my daughter to a psychiatrist, we will cut you into little pieces and..." Make pickles out of them. I know. Yeah, yeah. - See? - So you married a British girl and left her to rot. No, no. Radhika, he is boring me. Let's get started. - Boring! - Don't start. - Where should we start from? - Start? Start what? Let's chop his fingers off. No, no, no! Please, please! Can I chop his dick? Oh, please, I've always wanted to do that to a man! No, please, don't. Let's tear his clothes apart and leave this motherfucker naked. Tear this motherfucker's clothes apart. Freezing cold will teach him a lesson. No. O God, please don't do that! Stop it! Don't do that, please, man! Please! Let's hit on his head with something and knock him out. - That will shut him up. - Yeah, okay. - I will stay quiet. Forgive me! - Come on, hurry up. - Then we will go have a drink. - I'll... I'll buy you a drink. - Oh, shut up! - You'll buy a drink? - You'll buy her a drink?! - I have kids now. - Yeah, you didn't want that with me? - Please, I'm so sorry! - Please forgive me! Please! - Drink. - I'm so sorry. - We have to go to the pig farm, remember? - Pig farm? - We have to cut him into little pieces - and feed them to the pigs. - Oh. Please, please! - But pigs don't eat hairs. - We can go after that. I'm so sorry! Look, please! - Radhika, forgive me. - We can go anywhere. Listen. Hey. Is your taxi available? - When did you come back? - Just now. Is everything okay? What? Life does give you a second chance. It's up to you to recognize it. Right? - I have kids now. - Yeah, you didn't want that with me? Come on, hurry up. Then we will go have a drink. - I'll buy you a drink. - Oh, shut up! I am so sorry! I am so sorry! Please forgive me! - No, no, no! - What are you cutting? - What are you... - Run! Run, asshole! Get lost! Get lost before I change my mind! What happened? It's okay. It's okay. You did good. I could not, Anna. I just couldn't. It's okay. Listen, listen. I really tried, but I couldn't, man. I am proud of you. I am proud of you. I really am. I knew you wouldn't. I always knew that. Life does give you a second chance. It's up to you to recognize it. Right? Better late than never. Get in. Now, are you gonna tell me what happened? Never. What? Let's go, Driver. God knows why we keep running for our whole life. When we step out of our house, that's when we gain a fucking new perspective. In the face of bad times, either you give up... or give it your all. All the papers are fraud. I am sorry. I'll have to arrest you. Or, it screws you over. But, no matter what, life must go on.
