It's 11 PM, Mrs. President. THE WORLD OF YESTERDAY Do you want a drink, Prime Minister? No, thank you, Célia. Come in. What's he on about? What do you expect? He must be bad-mouthing me. - So? - I can't help, Didier. I'm sorry. - Franck doesn't want you involved? - No, it's me. But Franck agrees the IMF isn't for you. And I can't intervene now. You waited too long. He said it's not for me? Stop obsessing over Franck. You should've run for Congress. - You know I'd have lost. - So? An honorable defeat instead of a cushy job in the IMF. - Thought about the Refugees Commission? - Yes. Of course. - But... - But what? - Call Gaucher. He'll help you. - No! If you call him after the 1st round, he won't pick up. Do it now. I won't call that jerk. I'm tired, Elisabeth. No, don't play that game on me, not now. Look at me. Look. The Secretary-General wants a word, ma'am. - Is he here? - Yes. Send him in. In private, he said. Send him in. - Good evening, ma'am. - 'Evening, Franck. - 'Evening, Didier. - 'Evening, Franck. Yes? I want a word with you. Well, go ahead. Speak. I don't have good news, ma'am. I just got the latest polls. - It's not good. - Meaning? Willem is widening the lead, taking votes from everyone. He's now 5 points ahead of Gaucher, giving him great momentum for the 2nd round. Polls put them neck and neck. It was the same 5 years ago I still beat Willem. We know what Gaucher's like... but he's from our side. He's a republican, that's the main thing. Since when is Gaucher a republican? - Is that all? - No, ma'am. - What else? - It's for your ears only. - And Didier's. - I don't think so. Always a pleasure to see you, Franck! And yet I'm surprised to observe... that the idea of never seeing you again as of next month is quite pleasant. Strange, isn't it? Don't worry, I'll go. Goodbye, ma'am. Do what I said. And try to sleep. Goodbye, Mr. Prime Minister. So? I'm listening. Willem will win the elections. No! Nonsense! Gaucher will get the republican votes. Obviously. Speak, dammit! I've just heard from Alexandre Guiraudy, our ambassador in Moscow. After the 1st round, a Russian news site will show a video in which Rachid Wassouf receives cash in a briefcase. It dates from Gaucher's trip to Egypt 2 years ago when Wassouf accompanied him. - Have you seen it? - No, but one of our agents did. He told Alexandre it was damning. You see the man with the briefcase from behind. He speaks Arabic. You can clearly hear Wassouf alluding to the recipient of the funds, Gaucher, for his campaign. Maybe it's a fake. And maybe Wassouf kept the money. No. Wassouf's an old friend of Gaucher's and they went to Egypt. I checked. You know what he's like. It's no surprise. The real question is, how he didn't get caught all this time. I looked into it. The Russian news site is apparently financed by the Kremlin. Even if we intercept the recording, there must be 50 copies on 50 memory sticks. - Are you sure it's Russian money? - No, but... who else wants the far-right to win here? Did the ambassador pass on this intel to Christian or Hélène? No, Alexandre panicked and called me, not Homeland Security or the State Department. What did you tell him? To keep still. I've known him a long time. We can trust him. - Who knows? - Alexandre, me, and a Moscow agent. He'll keep quiet. The news won't leave the embassy. You know nothing, of course. Call Alexandre. Tell him to fly here now. And our Moscow agent. Send for Gaucher. And Yasmina so I know the legal implications. I want everything on this Wassouf. I don't think that's a good idea, ma'am. Gaucher's dead. He got framed like a rookie. He'll lose. No-one will vote for him. Sharing this info won't help us. It was prepared ages ago. We got screwed, Elisabeth. We didn't see it coming. You realize what you're saying? Yes, ma'am. But give me a few hours. The 1st round is in 3 days' time. Give me a few hours, dammit! A couple of hours. Please... Give me a little time. It's getting cold. You should go in. - Yes, dear? - I need a word. Just a second. Yes, sir? - Come see me in 30 minutes. - Very well. It always sounds serious, but I told you it's not. Where are you? I'm outside. What's happening to me, Mom? I'm having crazy dreams. So, I'm scared to go to bed. Don't be scared, Mila. I dreamed you were dead. I visited your grave. It was open. I went down some steps to a corridor with hands holding candlesticks. Like in that film we watched. Why do I have these shitty dreams? We'll talk about it tomorrow. It's OK. Yes, Mom, I know. It's always tomorrow or the next day. No point talking to you. I know I annoy you. No, you don't, sweetie. Get some sleep. I can't wait till tomorrow. Me too. I love you. Love you. So? You won't like my plan. We only have 3 days left. There's only one solution. By any means necessary, remember? After the 1st round, security will be tighter. This operation won't be possible. What? - Are you insane? - Sit down and listen. You're about to say something stupid. I don't need that. You and I know Willem is very dangerous. Look at the towns and areas his party runs. It all starts OK, there are pork barbecues, nativities, then they move on to migrants, homosexuals, Jews, Arabs, the unemployed, the death penalty and abortion. It'll be the same with him. He'll start slow, then... They're just towns and regions. He's accountable. But imagine when he's not anymore. - Quiet. - Listen. Listen to me. What I'm saying is terrible. But there's nothing else to say. It's the only solution. - He'll win, I say. - You said nothing! Russia, Turkey, Brazil, America, Islamist countries, North Korea, China, Cuba, Poland, Hungary, Austria, the Czechs and Slovaks, Brexit... Tomorrow, Germany, Italy, Finland, Belgium, Holland, and today, France. We know Willem is supported by Russia. They all are. We know he's friends with Europe's far-right parties, attends Nazi balls in Vienna... If France falls, Europe will fall. All the dikes will break. A fascist international is being set in motion. If Willem is elected, he will lead it. 12 million French people voted for the far right 5 years ago. 12 million! And you were the opponent. You! Not that... You should have stood again. I told you! Over and over. It's the fault of your pride! Gaucher wouldn't have stood. Either you made it to the 2nd round or you were out in the 1st round, the right would've won in the 2nd. I told you over and over! Gaucher is a piece of shit! You're responsible for... It's nearly finished. Hold me. Sorry to bother you, ma'am. The Secretary General wishes to have a word. Send him in. Sorry, I must take this. Yes, Mila? - Yes? - Am I disturbing you? Not at all. It's late. You should be asleep. No. I'm not mad at you. What? It was a dream. Don't worry about dreams. Dreams are nonsense. I love you lots. See you tomorrow. Sleep well. Where's this information from? The French state pays me to get information. Don't treat me like a fool! It's not tapped phones. He doesn't say that on the phone. He's not that stupid. That's his personal diary. An inside man? There's someone close to him who owes me a very big favor. Me personally, no-one else. - Who? - You don't want to know. - An elected representative? - Someone high up. I cover him, he gives me intel. It's a deal. - Why's that? - Don't ask. Someone who wants to replace him? And I encourage him. But it'll never happen. There's just Willem. As for the others... Luckily for us, we only have one problem: Willem. Behind him, there's nobody. They're all losers. So what if he has a mistress? Or send someone to get photos. Good father, ideal husband, religious... But he screws around all the time. That's your scoop. And alcohol. Why hasn't anyone ever covered that? Isn't there a video? People should know they might get an alcoholic president. That's not enough. They don't care about his whiskey intake. It reassures them, he's like them. And he's never been seen blind drunk. As for a mistress... Adultery versus corruption: who will the French choose? But this woman can be very useful. Dammit, Franck. He's not some wacko in Syria. 12 million French voted for him. He's not protected when he goes there. He usually leaves late at night. Say the word. We'll dress it up. You won't know a thing. - I said no. - Please listen to me. The Constitution makes you the head of the army. You can start wars and kill enemies, which you did. For 5 years, you had that courage. In Syria, Yemen, Sudan, you did it. You eliminated France's enemies. Now you won't take action. Democracy's worst enemy is about to take power. No! - You don't realize. - Stop it! - They want it. - No. - They'll vote him in. - They're angry, unhappy. And we've messed up. Dreams aren't nonsense. You're wrong. We had dreams, too, remember? But what happened, happened. We tried, but we messed up. Everyone hates you but me. You swine! "One doesn't govern innocently," as you know. Think you're Saint-Just or Robespierre? Neither. But we have no other solution. We have 3 days left. Then, it'll be too late. How many years have I been with you, advising you? I wasn't often wrong. Look where I got you. Look where you are, who you are. Think History stops after you? You have a massive responsibility. Think you can leave this continent to the far right, job done? Your 5 years, your photo hanging in town halls? If you do nothing, there'll be nothing left of you. You'll be a stain in the history books for doing nothing. Do you think I didn't want us to succeed? Let's not let chaos spread after us. I won't be responsible for a civil war. Nor will you. - I could lock you up for this plan. - Go ahead. But do as I say. Despite what you think, if you don't do it, you'll never be able to look yourself in the eye. Goodnight, ma'am. Is this woman under surveillance? No. You know I only act with your agreement. - You don't have my agreement. - Very well, ma'am. Leave that. When will we arrive? In 10 minutes, ma'am. It's a delicate operation. It must remain secret. Only use people you can trust. - Ma'am. - Hello, Mr. Minister. - Hello, ma'am. - Mrs. Mayor. - Hello, ma'am. - Chief of Police. - Hello, ma'am. - Mr. Director. - Hello, Congressman. - Hello, ma'am. Thank you for keeping your word and opening this police station, a few hours from the end of your term. I know you want me to go, but it's more than a few hours. You have to stand me for 3 long weeks. And I promised. I wanted this police station built. I signed the budget when I was in your shoes. With the hand you're crushing right now. Forgive me. Ma'am, over here, please. - To the right. - Over here. Both of you, look to the right. I'll go kiss my daughter if I may. Go ahead. How are you, dear? A photo with Mila, please. - Let's get it over with. - OK. Watch over her. Serge will replace me. Will you go to Mr. Gaucher's next meeting? That's all for now. Michel, put me through to HQ. It's Patrick. My eye has been bothering me. I need it checked out. No, it's urgent. Serge will stand in for me. Can you sign me out? Thanks. Hi there. Seen the polls? Of course. It doesn't bother you? 50/50 at the 2nd round. - Don't you see there's a big problem? - 50/50? I feel like a spy when we meet here! Stop smiling like a cretin. Why? Do you think you've already won? Calm down. You need to concentrate on the 1st round. That's the key. So, yesterday's jokes on Willem's antisemitism were amateurish. It's not Twitter or some dumb TV show! There's no 3rd man, luckily. But you can't let him get ahead. 5 points, dammit! OK, I get it! I'm not Elisabeth de Raincy. I won't be lectured by you or anyone. You'll be very surprised by the results. Yes, because the French really like me. You should watch those dumb TV shows and come to my rallies. They like me more than your boss who they can't stand! So, opposite me, that fascist won't reach 42% at the 2nd round. 50/50. Wanna bet on it? - He won't get over 40. - Stop it. You need a bigger lead. Anything can happen between the 2 rounds. Something unexpected. - Like what? - I don't know... Something which disrupts your campaign! Or you might mess up the debate. Don't worry about the debate! I'll crush that jerk! Willem will be found all over Paris in pieces like a jigsaw puzzle! Are you on something? - What're you talking about? - Can we talk strategy? There's 2 days left. I leave in 25 minutes. Of course, dear boy. I'm not here to eat cake. Again... Again. Meet Marie-Pierre Laloi. - How's it spelled? - In 1 word. She's the new head of Europe Aid. A fine woman. She'd be ideal for Foreign Affairs. No, I promised the post to Edouard. You owe him nothing. You need new faces. Meet her. Bring her to rallies. She'll go down well. Oh, wow! Look at this little shit! Mama must have scolded him! He'll have to kneel down and open wide! Hello, Didier. No, I'm delighted that you call me. Of course. Of course... Yes, of course. The weather is kind to us. I wasn't hoping for the sun in coming here for my last speech as head of state. The warmth of your friendship is worth far more. I didn't only want to talk about friendship but also of results. You wanted to see me? Mila told me. I told her not to tell you. I know. But she's a child. She's very upset. OK, so? This is insane, Elisabeth. You need treatment now. Never mind what people think. Is that all? You need proper care. - Go to a hospital. - Are you a doctor? No, but not getting treated is a huge risk. I am. - Really treated. - I will, in 3 weeks' time. You should have done so 3 months ago! The longer you wait, the higher the risk. Is that all? I have more serious issues to deal with. "More serious"? You're losing your mind, Elisabeth. You're crazy. Show me your phone. - Pardon? - Show me your phone. You think I'm spying on you? After 10 years and a child together, you still don't trust me? I do, but show me your phone. Bring me my daughter, please. I asked you not to tell your dad. Why did you? I thought he could persuade you. It's a state secret. I trusted you with it. Do you realize what you did? You betrayed a state secret. - It's serious. - I only told Dad. I'm sorry. Don't cry. In 3 weeks' time, we'll be together. I'll get treated. You'll come and live with me. We'll do lots together, I promise. I'll take you on a trip. We'll go away, just the two of us. We can go back to New York if you want. Remember how you loved it as a kid? I don't care about that. I want you to get better, get treated. I know, Mila... I know. But we're strong, aren't we? What did we say? Girl power! - So? - It's done. - And the bedroom? - He's doing it. That's it. - The Chancelor. - Thank you, Célia. Where there's a will... I scratch your back... I don't know what that means. You scratch mine. If you like, but help me. Thank you, Heinrich. Elisabeth wants to see you. - 'Evening, Didier. - 'Evening, Franck. Come in. I spoke to Heinrich. He'll help us. That's great. Well done. - Call Birgit. - Of course. I told Didier about Gaucher. He suggested something. It's a bad idea, but I want your opinion. You're making a terrible mistake. Send him in. Tell Franck. We add irregularities to Willem's campaign accounts that are serious enough to have the elections rescheduled. I know who can help us, as do you. It's a plausible situation. It almost nearly happened. It'll buy us a few months to get organized. Is that your solution for Willem? So, you'll let him get elected? Got a better idea? Franck's right. It's not good enough. There'll be a legal battle. The truth will come out. Won't it? We need Gaucher to give up. When he hears about this video, he'll give up. It's clearly the best solution. He has to give up just after the 1st round. Willem 1st, him 2nd. With only 1 candidate, the elections are canceled, the video won't come out. We must be able to find some excuse for him. I don't know... an illness? After the 1st round, he gets lab results, announcing he has cancer or something. He'd be going out with honor. It's ideal. But... if Gaucher is sick - officially sick... only you can take up the torch. You'll be able to stand again. "The last bastion against barbarism". It's you or the fascists! Let's not get carried away. Let me study the constitutional consequences of a withdrawal. If you agree with this idea, we'll call Gaucher tomorrow morning together. But measure the repercussions of this choice. If the elections are postponed, you must remain president for 3 to 6 months and probably run again, Didier is right. And in that case, if Gaucher accepts, you stand a good chance of winning. Does that suit you? Let's do that. You haven't taken your coat off. Sorry? - Your coat. - Oh, sorry. Stop saying sorry. You're home early and you're reading. Strange... Not saving the world? Not tonight. - Melville was so handsome. - Really? In his youth, he looked like Clint Eastwood or Sam Shepard. At the end of his life... he looked the same, but with a long white beard and white hair. You don't have much white hair. For France's most powerful man, I mean. Have you eaten? Twice. I'm off to Brussels tomorrow. - Coming through? - OK. - You'll love this film. - I'm coming, I promise. Ma'am... Ma'am! Ma'am. Ma'am... What? - What's the time? - 4:20. There's been an attack. Will the death toll rise? There may be more bodies in the rubble. 50 deaths. At least 12 are French. And many injured. What's puzzling is that we heard about threats to financial centers like Geneva but from the far left. They don't associate with beardies. All the intel notes will be here shortly, ma'am. The nightclub was in the French banking quarter. French banks are all over Geneva. That doesn't mean a thing! Ma'am... We've just learned something potentially very troubling. - Spit it out. - What? The terrorist who blew himself up was French. On the watch list. 12 dead and 10 injured according to our correspondent. Those are the latest figures for French nationals, but the toll could rise. Rescue workers continue to search the site. Reacting to this disaster, François Willem gives us his first declaration from his HQ. François Willem, hello. What is your reaction to this latest attack? I'm waiting for further details from the authorities, but what we know is damning. The worst thing, other than the victims who are in my thoughts, is that this tragedy could have been avoided. The bomber was known to the police as he was on a watch list. It's scandalous. How many times did I ask that the suspects be imprisoned? How many times did Mr. Gaucher say, when he was PM, that such a measure was not possible? It's worse than incompetence. It's failure to rescue a country in danger, or even complicity. I say solemnly: "Mr. Gaucher and Mrs. de Raincy have blood on their hands." Do you think that you could have prevented this attack if you'd been in their shoes? My position has always been clear. The war on terror is one of the key points of my manifesto. I promise the French who will vote on Sunday that such a tragedy will never happen again. Once elected, I will lock up everyone who threatens public order. What a son of a bitch. Get me the families' numbers. Right away. Don't touch me. Should I stay? Mrs. Bachir? - Hello. This is Elisabeth de Raincy. - Hello, ma'am. I want to assure you of my personal support and of the grief of the French nation as a whole. I know... Forgive me. I understand your pain... even though I can't experience it like you. - He came briefly last night at 10. - No escort car. His chauffeur parks in a back street. The bodyguard waits outside. Same when they leave. They take main roads, stop for red lights. When he enters his home, he has no protection. I doubt he'll be back before Sunday. It didn't go well. - He yelled at her and walked out. - So I saw. There must be videos on her laptop or her phone. I haven't found any for now. Of him, at least. They're extremely careful. Leave me some time. We don't have any. Let me see. Find me something. Our country faces very real challenges. They are serious and numerous. But I wish to say this to France. The challenges will be met. The only winner of these elections... is hope. The first challenge is to regain the nation's trust and unity. Our differences must never oppose us. We must constantly remember who we are and how far we have come. Proud of our history, of our values, those of the Republic, proud of our diversity, proud, above all, of the 3 words which unite us: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. My urgent duty is to reaffirm in all circumstances our intangible principles of secularism and to fight all forms of racism, antisemitism, and discrimination. Ladies and gentlemen... I want to see Willem. Organize a meeting tonight. Very well. Have him brought here discreetly. - Here? - Yes, here. - Yes, Didier. - How are you? OK. - Did you hear Willem? - Yes. Gaucher? - What did he say? - Nothing much. But something is bothering me. - Can I see you? - When? Now. I can be there in 15 minutes. It won't take long. I don't have time. What's it about? I called Gaucher, like you said. Well... I don't get it. He said he was with Franck. Gaucher? When was that? Yesterday morning. That's what I don't get. Franck had already told you about the briefcase. Even if he's advising Gaucher in secret... isn't it weird that he keeps seeing him when he knows he won't get elected? I'll call you back. Get me our Moscow ambassador. Yes, ma'am. The Secretary General wishes to see you. Not right now. Patrick... Stop everything. I'm canceling. Your phone, please, sir. Of course. Hello, ma'am. Hello, Mr. Congressman. What you said was beyond scandalous. It was shameful. I'm sorry if I hurt you. You understand that my only target is Gaucher. We think the same. "Ma'am." Ma'am, yes. Maybe I went a bit too far. I said I was sorry. If that Islamist were in jail, it wouldn't have happened. This is a constitutional state. Locking up those on the watch list is illegal. They're just suspects. You're a fairground barker. And a dangerous one. I came because I thought you had intel for me on the attack. Not to be yelled at. I want to show you something. Know what that room is? No. It's the Jupiter Room. Only the President and generals are allowed in. It's a heavily guarded, secret place. I wanted to see you one last time... and tell you you'll never set foot in that room. Please show the congressman out. She's not in her office. I don't know where she is Why did you show Willem the Jupiter Room? What do you want? Why call Alexandre? - Why are you seeing Gaucher? - Why? You asked me to coach him. What would he have thought if I stopped? Did that fool Didier put this in your head? You suspected me of lying to you? Is that it? Why did you do that? Do you realize what you did? I called Alexandre. He confirmed the existence of the video. How could you think I'd betray you? Do you realize what you did? You can't say you didn't know about the video. Alexandre can destroy you when he wants. He's loyal. Loyal, him? What about me? All I ever did was for you. No-one is loyal to you but me, Elisabeth, no-one! Alexandre will sell you out to Gaucher to keep his job. He'll say you called him. Gaucher will spill the beans to discredit you. You knew and kept quiet. That'll be in the history books. It's the first time you've doubted me. 20 years' loyalty and there you go. You don't trust me anymore. I don't know why. I irritate you every time I open my mouth. We're like an old couple. - It's pathetic... - Quiet. Do you realize how lucky we were? Born at the same time in the same place. We were lucky to meet and like one another. What if we hadn't like one another? What would we have become? I'm not proud, you know that. But I have principles. No-one can take them away. It's too late. I had to renounce many of them, like you over the last 20 years, but not the most important ones. Some things aren't acceptable. They're non-negotiable. You can't renounce them. You can humiliate me, cast me aside, do what you like with me. But doubt my loyalty? Doubt my love for you? Do... Do as I say. If you don't want me to do it, ask Patrick. He'll get it done. I hope you did. Did you? Ask him. Do it. It's the only solution. I'm done here... if you're not able, right here, right now, to ask for forgiveness... I swear I'm prepared to forgive you only if you ask me. You leave me no choice, Franck. Send in Dimitri, please. Don't do that. Sit down, Dimitri. The Secretary General brought me his resignation, which I accepted. I'm appointing you instead. It is effective at once. Yes, ma'am. You can see to the details. We'll talk more tomorrow. You're done here. You take care. Appointment made. Thank you Do you still need me? Franck left a letter for you. You and I are nothing We planned 30 minutes for the visit to Geneva hospital. There are 6 injured French people. Then, 15 minutes for a press conference. The Swiss President will let you speak first. If you want to, of course. It's Dimitri. I'll call him when I'm in the air. Dimitri, it's Clémence. The President says... I'll tell her. She'll call you back. Our Moscow ambassador is dead. He was found at home. Apparently a heart attack. - Hello, Elisabeth. - Hello, Christian. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello, Hélène. I thought you'd be pleased. You know where I'm going? I'm glad to see you, sweetie. Me too. Let's go. Thanks. But every shadow is ultimately the daughter of light and only he who has known light and dark, war and peace, rise and fall, has truly lived.
