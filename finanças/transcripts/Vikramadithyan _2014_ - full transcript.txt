Here. - Would you kiss me? - No. I'll get you some tea. - It would mean such a lot to me. - Would it? Thank you. - I can't sleep. Would you kiss me? - Oh. - You're so pretty. - Will you tuck me in, please? [ Laughing ] Very funny. Go to sleep now. - Where's the doctor? - Don't ask.

[ Man #2 ] No, sorry. I think I was a pilot. I was found in the wreckage of a plane at the beginning of the war. Can you remember where you were born? Am I being interrogated? You should be trying to trick me, make me speak German. - Which I can, by the way. - Why? - Are you German? - No. How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything? Might-- Might I have a sip of water? [ Sea Gulls Calling ] [ Gulps ] - Thank you. - It's okay. I remember lots of things. I remember her garden, plunging down to the sea. - Nothing between you and France. - This was your garden? - Or my wife's. - You were married then? I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Look. [ Gasping ] I have this much lung. The rest of my organs are packing up. What could it possibly matter if I'm a Tutankhamen? I'm a bit of... toast, my friend. Sorry I can't help you. [ Horn Honking ] [ Breathing Heavily ] Are you all right? I know you hate to be moved. I'm sorry. - [ Honking ] - Hana! - Jan? - Hana! There's meant to be lace in the next village. The boys are gonna take me. - You don't have any money, do ya? - No. - Just in case there's a sale. - No. Hana, I know you do. Come on. - No! - Oh, come on. I swear to God, this'll be the last time. I swear. She's a softie. She loves me. - I'll pay you back! I promise! - [ Laughing ] I'm not sewing anything else for you. I love you! Whoa! Pienza, boys! [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Man ] Get some water over here! Jan! Oh, no! Hana, where're you going? - Stay back! - Stop, Hana! - Stay-- - [ Crying ] No! No! - Hey! Hey! - Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! Stand absolutely still! You're walking in a mine field! Good. That's good. Just stay still for me... and we'll be fine. What are you doing? What the bloody hell do you think you're doing? [ Hana ] It's Jan's. [ Sighs ] [ Hana ] Are you in pain? Do you need something? - Yes. - Okay. Are you okay? - You and Jan were-- - We keep moving him in and out of the truck. Why? He's dying. What's the point? We can hardly leave him. Do you mean leave him? No, no, I don't mean leave him. This will help you. I must be a curse. Anybody who loves me... [ Sighs ] anybody who gets close to me-- Oh, I must be cursed. Which is it? Music [ Single Piano Key Plays ] [ Grunts ] - When he dies, I'll catch up. - It's not safe here. The whole country's crawling with bandits and Germans and God knows what. - It's madness! I can't allow it. - The war is over. How can it be desertion? It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean literally. This is normal, a shock, for all of us, Hana. I need morphine, a lot. And a pistol. If anything ever happened to you, I'd never forgive myself. We're heading for Leghorn. "Livorno," the ltalians call it. We'll expect you. Fine. - Thank you. - You're welcome, ma'am. - Oh, Hana. - I'll be okay. I'll catch up. Good. [ Sighs ] [ Muttering Song Lyrics ] [ Continues ] [ Engines Droning ] [ Grunting ] What-- What was all that banging? Are you-- Are you fighting rats, or the entire German army? No. I was repairing the stairs. I found a library, and the books were very useful. Before you find too many uses for those books, you might read some to me. I think they're all in ltalian, but I'll look, yes. - What about your own book? - My book? Oh, yes, the Herodotus. Yes, you can read him. Oh. I found plums. We have plums in the orchard. There. We have an orchard. Herodotus is the father of history. - Do you know that? - I don't know anything. Hmm. It's a-- It's a very plum... plum. [ Thud ] [ Man Speaking Arabic ] [ Responds In Arabic ] [ Arabic ] A mountain the shape of a woman's back. Good, good. - Hello, Geoffrey! - Madox, hello! - Welcome to the expedition. - How do you do? Geoffrey Clifton. Splendid to finally meet you all. This is Dante D'Agostino and Diggy Bermann, our archaeologist. - Beautiful plane. - This is Sharif Al Fouad, Egyptologist. - And this is my wife, Katharine. - Hello. We're your new apprentices. -Welcome to the lnternational Sand Club. -[ Laughing ] - To the lnternational Sand Club. - I'll get cups. - Marvellous plane. Did you look? - Y es. Isn't it? A wedding present from Katharine's parents. We're calling it Rupert Bear. - Hello. Geoffrey Clifton. - Almasy. We can finally consign my old bird to the scrap heap. Mrs Clifton, I'd like to present... - Count Almasy. - Hello. Geoffrey gave me your monograph and I was reading up in the desert. - Very impressive. - Thank you. I wanted to meet the man who could write a long paper with so few adjectives. Well, a thing is still a thing, no matter what you place in front of it. Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car. - [ Madox ] Broken car. - It's still a car. - Not much use, though. - [ Katharine ] Love? Romantic love, plutonic love, filial love. - Quite different things, surely. - Uxoriousness. That's my favourite kind of love. Excessive love of one's wife. - Now there you have me. - [ Men Laughing ] - They're tourists. - Absolute rot. They're highly recommended by the Royal Geographic Society. She's charming and has read everything. - He's meant to be a ruddy good flier. - We don't need another pilot. He can make aerial maps of the whole route. You can't explore from the air, Madox. If you could explore from the air, life would be very simple. Contact. Contact. I should try and move the bed. I want you to be able to see the view. It's good. It's a view from a monastery. - I can already see. - How? - How can you see anything? - No, no, not the window. I can't bear the light anyway. I can see all the way to the desert. I'm turning you. Exploring before the war, making maps. Is there sand in my eyes? Are you cleaning sand from my ears? No sand. That's your morphine speaking. I can see my wife in that view. Are you remembering more? - Could I have a cigarette? - Are you crazy? [ Coughing ] Why-- Why are you so determined to keep me alive? [ Sighs ] Because I'm a nurse.

[ Hana ] "The King insisted that he would find some way... "to prove beyond dispute... "that his wife was fairest of all women. "'l will hide you in your room where we sleep,' said Candaules-- - said Candaules." - Candaules. "Candaules." Candaules. Candaules tells Gyges that the Queen has the same practise every night. She takes off her clothes... and puts them on the chair by the door to her room. "'And from where you stand, you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure.'" And that evening, it's exactly as the King has told him. She goes to the chair, removes her clothes one by one, until she's standing naked in full view of Gyges. And indeed, she was more lovely than he could have imagined. But then, the Queen looked up... and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And although she said nothing, she shuddered. And the next day, she sends for, for Gyges and challenged him. - And hearing his story, this is what she said. - Off with his head! [ Laughing ] She said, "Either you must submit to death... "for gazing on that which you should not, "or else kill my husband who has shamed me... and become King in his place." So Gyges kills the King, marries the Queen and becomes ruler of Lydia for 28 years. The end. Shall I spin the bottle? [ Madox ] So, Geoffrey, let that be a lesson to you. - [ Katharine ] D'Agostino! - D'Agostino! Are you asleep? Yes. No. I'm dropping off. [ Cawing ] Go away! Go! Go! [ Grunts ] Buon giorno. - Hana? - What do you want? I met your friend Mary. She said I should stop and see if you were all right. Apparently we're neighbours. My house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier. - Bonjour. - Bonjour. For you. I'd like to take credit for it, but it's from Mary. My name is David Caravaggio, but nobody ever called me David. Caravaggio they find too absurd to miss out on. Oh! [ Snickers ] Oh! Oh, shit. Stupid hands. Let me do that. They're fresh. I haven't had an egg in-- Have you noticed there are chickens? In ltaly, you get chickens but no eggs. In Africa, they're always eggs but never chickens. - Who's separating them? - You were in Africa? Yes, I was. So was my patient. Look, I'd like to stay for a while. I have to do some work here. I speak the language. There are partisans to be disarmed. We embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know, while we hide. I was a thief, so the army thought I'd be good at it. - So you can shoot a pistol? - No. Do you have a problem with those? No. - I should look at them before you go. - Look. It's a big place. We needn't disturb each other. I'll sleep in the stable. It doesn't matter where I sleep. I don't sleep. I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company. I don't need to be looked after. There is a man downstairs. He brought us eggs. He might stay. Why? Can he lay eggs? He's Canadian. Why are people always so happy when they collide with one from the same place? What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street? Did you invite him to live with you? He needn't disturb you. He can't. I'm already disturbed. [ Sighs ] There's a war. Where you come from becomes important. [ Patient ] Why? I hate that idea. Ah! It's gonna work. Gently. [ Knocking ] Can I help? It's finished. So, you're our Canadian pickpocket? Thief I think is more accurate. I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts? Oh, all over. All over? I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed. - Are you leaving us? - Yes. Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds. [ Laughs ] Then I'm definitely going. Does she have war wounds? I think anybody she ever loves... tends to die on her. - Are you planning to be the exception? - Me? [ Laughs ] I think you've got... the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So... Caravaggio. Hana thinks you invented your name. And you've forgotten yours. I said that no one would ever invent such a preposterous name. And I said you can forget everything, but you never forget your name. Count Almasy. That name mean anything to you? Or Katharine Clifton? [ People Chattering ] Oh, I'm sorry. - How much did you pay? - Oh, hello. They don't see foreign women in this market. How much did you pay? Um, 7, 8 pounds, I suppose. - Which store? - Why? You've been cheated. Oh, don't worry, we'll take it back. I don't want to take it back. - This is not worth 8 pounds. - It is to me. - Did you bargain? - I don't care to bargain. That insults them. I don't believe that. I think that you're insulted by me somehow. I'd be very happy to obtain the correct price for this. I apologize if I appear abrupt. I'm rusty at social graces. How do you find Cairo? - Did you visit the pyramids? - Excuse me. Or the Sphinx? [ Almasy ] Latitude, 25, 33. Longitude, 25, 16. We attempt to drive northeast of Kofer, we'll leave our bones in the desert. - I disagree. - You're Hungarian. You always disagree. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. - How is your charming wife? - Marvellous. She's in love with the hotel plumbing. She's either in the swimming pool. She swims for hours. She's a fish. It's quite incredible. Or she's in the bath. - [ Laughing ] - Actually, she's just outside. Chaps only in the Long Bar. Mrs Clifton. You'll have to forgive us. We're not accustomed to the company of women. Not at all. I was thoroughly enjoying my book. - The team is in mourning, darling. - Oh, really? I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition. Oh. Well, what'll you do? More modest expedition, or even wait a year. - It's a disaster. - Remind our families we still exist. Good heavens, are you married, Madox? Very much so. We all are. - Save my friend Almasy here. - I feel much better. Don't you, darling? We were feeling rather self-conscious. Let's toast, then. Absent wives. - [ All ] Absent wives. - And present ones. And future ones. Music [ Jazz ] Music [ Song Ends ] Thank you. Excuse me. May l? Music [ Slow ] - Why did you follow me yesterday? - I'm sorry. What? After the market, you followed me to the hotel. I was concerned. A woman in that part of Cairo, a Europ
