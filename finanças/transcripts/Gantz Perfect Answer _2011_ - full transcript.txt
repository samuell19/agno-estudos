An ordinary university student, Kurono Kei... ...and Katou Masaru, who is working to support his younger brother. The two people who were childhood friends coincidentally encountered each other again. And then... ...they died. The two who were supposed to be dead woke up in an apartment... ...in which a black mysterious sphere called GANTZ is placed. In that room which they can't get out of, they suddenly received a command from GANTZ. "If you want to go back, go crush this guy." That was... to battle with the unknown aliens hidden around the Earth... An inescapable command. They were then sent to a residential area... ...and without knowing what was going on, they battled with the aliens. They barely got their victory. What awaited Kurono and the others when they returned to the room was... ...were the remarks that GANTZ gave them for battling. and the total points they got for defeating the aliens. If they get 100 points, they can be released from this world, or revive a beloved person of theirs. It was a frightening reality. These people who were supposed to die... ...may be summoned at any point in time while being able to return... ...to normal life when day comes. Kurono, who came to terms with reality while battling... ...and Katou, who continued to deny this battle. The tough and painful battle goes on anyway. ...and their friends died one by one. And, in the end, while facing the strongest alien, even Katou's life was taken away. When Kurono was about to give in to sadness, Kojima Tae helped him stand on his feet again with her honest feelings. He swore in his heart that he would earn 100 points in order to revive Katou. In a battle that sees no end, he's determined to continue fighting. Let's go! "Thank you for the hard work. I'm Yoshioka." "Tomorrow, the studio has delayed the schedule to an hour later," "so I will come to fetch you at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning." "It's 8 o'clock, so the time's later than the previous schedule by an hour." "That's all for now. Thank you very much." "At 10:29 pm" The message is over. [Thank you for your hard work last night.] [You got the first key.] [There are four keys leading to the room.] [The next person is this.] [Yamamoto] [Special trait: Intelligence] [Favourite thing: Good students] [5 months ago] You mustn't die! Sorry. I love you. I love you, Kurono-kun. [Postscript concerning file #1-378930-s] [Unexplained destruction] [Acts of terrorism?] [A 23-year-old woman disappears right in her own house] [Confirmed several consecutive new cases where several people go missing.] [New developments from the incident involving the disappearance of the victims' bodies in the subway the other day] [Confirmed existence] "GANTZ - Perfect Answer" Raw provided by bittersweet_bun@ourhour Timed by ianne_xxyl Soon it will be five months since the incident in which the National Museum collapsed, and yet the cause of the incident still remains unknown. According to the police, there's a possibility that it's an act of terrorism. - Is the burger done? - Yes, coming. I'll take this. Please. - Please help me with the tomatoes. - Thanks. Excuse me. Oh, Kei-chan. - How's your homework? - I'm done. You're not. But Tae-chan's manga is so interesting. Hey, this hero is written based on Kei-chan, right? I didn't mean that... Are you embarrassed? Yeah. This manga is interesting, right? I'm telling her to submit it to the Rookie of the Year award. I'm nowhere near good yet. I have to improve my skills. You're good already. I'm no good yet. There are a lot of better people. I said you're gonna be fine. Ah~ I want to show this to Nii-chan too. He's not coming back yet? Oh, maybe a little more. It's really because of his job, right? Of course. Oi, don't whistle in the middle of the night. Where is he really? Ayumu-kun's brother. Sorry. I heard from Ayumu-kun that the same thing happened before. That time, his brother was arrested by the police. Katou's not that kind of person. This. The pay for this month. I don't need it, really. But look, you don't have to pay for the rents here, right Kojima-san? However, I want you to come to this house for a while more. Of course I will. If I'm not with him, he won't do his homework. Ayumu is good at cooking anyway. Well, I can't deny that. Also... If I come here, I can see Kurono-kun too. Wa-wait. Please don't keep quiet. I was just creating what I'm about to draw just now. I was thinking of how to draw this particular romantic scene. Well, I have to get going. Eh? But you said you don't have to work today. Ah, someone just called me suddenly. Kojima-san, you can just stay over. Hold on a second. Huh? "The train will be coming to the first line soon." "Since it's dangerous, please stand behind the yellow line." You were chosen too, weren't you? You will not get used to it at first, so feel free to just watch what we do. Kobayashi-san is the same as you. [It's completely up to me how I want to use you people's lives.] I'm sorry for startling you. There's something I want to ask you, so will you give me some of your time? Since you abruptly announced your break from activities, there have been many speculations going around, haven't there? Rumours have it that it could be due to your illness, marriage, pregnancy, or your move to overseas. But I've dug up everything. You're from the media? The chance is slight but there is an incredible sequence of related events that has been happening. People who are supposed to die from accidents have their bodies suddenly vanish from the scene. The day just goes on as if nothing happened. And then, for some reason, that night, there will definitely be... ...some destruction occurring somewhere in Tokyo. Don't you know about this? No. Well then, how about that rumour? The rumour about the black sphere... ...and the room that contains it... You know it, don't you? Then, four. You can ask me four questions. Your aim. Why are you all gathering at this place? We're searching for the black ball. Black ball? If we have it, we can go where we want. You mean the room that contains the black sphere? You know it, huh. Where did you hear about it? I came here today to ask about that. Where is that room? It's not in this reality. What do you mean? You can't to go to that room if it's not necessary. Who are you people? That's the fifth question. Why are you chasing after the same incident as I do? Sixth one. What do you want exactly? If you want to know, investigate this one more person and come back here. Why don't you go somewhere together once in a while? You and Kei-chan. Focus. Why? You two are dating, right? We are not. How come? You confessed to him, didn't you? Until your brother comes back, Kurono-kun... Seems that he can't think of any other thing. But I'm fine. When things calm down, I'll try asking him once. Seriously? Seriously. Ok! Homework. [Total 94 points. 6 points until it's over] It's gonna be soon, huh? Yes. Let me go! Where the heck is this place? - Where am I? - Please calm down. Speaking of which, who are you people? Who cares about that. I was an office worker. For the last 20 years, I have worked for the company every day. Well, I was dismissed because of a restructure though. I'm a nurse. That's during the day. At night, she's a hostess. You lie about you age, right? This auntie's still popular at this age. Can you believe it? He's a pimp. Women's enemy. I'm a freeter. Right now, I'm working part-time at a curry shop. It's a chain shop, but the food is delicious. I'm a system engineer at this company named Orient. Please contact me if need be. And, how about you? I'm a hairdresser. Kurono-san is really a normal university student? Since... you're really strong and everything. He is, indeed. Why are you so strong? Because there's someone I want to revive. GANTZ. He was one of us before. He fought with us. Kurono-kun wants to revive him. But... not only him. I want to revive everyone who's died here. And then, let us all be released from here and become free together. [Nakamura] [Special trait: Noisy] [Favourite thing: Jogging] [You got the third key] [You got the third key] [You got the third key] [One more left, and you can go back] [The last key is this person.] [Kojima Tae] [Special trait: Weak] [Favourite thing: Kurono-kun] Did you come on time the other day? Hmm? For what? Your part-time job? Part-time...? Oh, yeah I did. Tough, isn't it? It is. There is this person named Suzuki, and for some reason she didn't turn up. That's why the shop didn't have enough people, so they just called me out. What's wrong? Kurono-kun, did something good happen? There's something, right? You can tell? What is it? What is it? Well actually, I was gonna tell Ayumu. Katou is gonna come home soon. Eh? He's been contacting you? Hm? Katou asked me... ...to keep it from other people. I see. More importantly, there's some information I want to give Kojima-san... Well, "information" isn't exactly the word... Wanna go to amusement park? Let's go? Just the two of us, once in a while. Are you talking about... that time I confessed to you? That was... I told you it was just at the surge of the moment. Please forget about it. How can I forget it? Hey, let's go. Impossible, impossible. Absolutely impossible. I have acrophobia. I can't handle the ferris wheel or roller coaster at all... Look. You even drew it in your sketchbook, right? The scene at the amusement park? Maybe if you go there, it can become your inspiration to draw manga. Then... There's one condition. What is it? Please start calling me by my first name from now on. Eh? Call me now. Please. Well, that's a little... Maybe now is not the right time. The next time we meet, I'll call you that, ok? I'll definitely call you that when we met at the amusement park. Yes. Definitely. See you. Welcome back, Kei-chan. How are you alive? GANTZ did something? You don't remember? How many people are there? Eight people, including me. Recently, we got three more people. GANTZ... I want to put an end to it. How? You don't know? There's a ball this big. No idea. I'll come again. If you know something, tell me. GANTZ, show me people who've died. What's the matter? Katou was revived. Eh? How come? Well, I don't know about that. But look, he's still in here. What is going on? [Katou] Oh... erm... Nii-chan? What? Um... I'm Kojima, Kurono-kun's classmate at the college. Ayumu-kun, come see him. Ayumu-kun? What's so important that you even neglect your younger brother? It's because you have work to do, right? I'm asking you, Nii-chan. Because I have work. Really? Really. Oh, yeah? Should I go back? There are things you can't talk when I'm here, so... I'm taking my leave. I'm glad for you, Ayumu-kun. [Welcome back, Nii-chan] I memorized how to make it when you weren't home. [Welcome back, Nii-chan] Try it. You're the first person I made it for. This is Kojima. Erm, Ayumu-kun's brother came home earlier. And also, there's something I want to ask... About the amusement park, Ayumu-kun and his brother are coming too... That's why, it won't be a date. I want to see you. Can I go to your workplace right now? [Kojima Tae] [Kojima Tae] Ayukawa Eriko's started to make her move. At Kita, Senzoku station. "A new morning has come" "It's a morning of hope" This will repeat many times over. I stopped this after my child was born. I have to get released soon for the sake of my family. What's the matter? [Your lives have been taken away.] [If you want to go back, go crush this guy.] [Alien dressed in black] [Special trait: looking normal at first glance] [Favourite thing: black ball] [Favourite thing: black ball] Let's go. [Please go.] Where's this place? A train? Something is fishy. Hey, you... Have we ever met long before? It moved. It's the subway! What? The subway? Everyone, don't space out. "The train will be departing soon." There are people here. This has never happened before, right? Take care of the front part of the train. Ayukawa Eriko? She's riding the train by herself? Everyone, we are not a suspicious group of people. We are not doing anything to harm you either. What? Is it like an event or something? Kurono-san! Don't shoot! Don't drag others into this! Can you hear people screaming? There are shooting sounds too. What the? What's going on? Isn't this dangerous? Takahashi! You guys are so amazing. As I thought... I remember... I remember! I remember. I've done the same thing before. What? The two who were in the room before, Nakamura-san and Kobayashi-san too. Eh? Stop! It's dangerous here! I said we should go to the back! Come. Kurono Kei. Kurono-kun? Run away from here. Wait. Sorry. Stop it! You're heavy. Move aside. I'm covering for you. She's tough. Yeah. This is revenge. This is revenge. You people were the ones who started this first. You people have killed so many of my friends. I'll never forgive you- Everyone's safe, right? Auntie isn't here. [Well then, let's see the points] Hold on a second. Oi! [Well then, let's see the points] [Takahashi] [0 point. Total 88 points] [Too protective of Auntie] What the heck is this? Oi. I told you Auntie isn't here. Auntie isn't here! Auntie isn't here! Auntie isn't here! [Good work. You got the first key.] [Kobayashi] [The second key] [Yamamoto] [You got the second key.] "You know it, don't you?" "The black sphere... and the room that contains it." Black sphere? Room? GANTZ! [It totally depends on me how to use your life] [That's on theory.] This is revenge. You people killed my friends. [Sakurai] [0 point. Total 69 points] [31 points left until it's over] Auntie's here, isn't she? That's her, right? Is this for real? Isn't that Ayukawa? Ayukawa... Eriko? You finally came, huh? Yes. Seems so. [Well then, let's continue with the points] Everyone, please be careful. This woman... was the one who killed me. Long time no see, Kobayashi-san. Huh? Kobayashi-san, don't you remember this room? You don't remember me? Huh? What? [Kobayashi] [0 point] [Totally doesn't remember a thing] Two years ago... I fought while protecting you. [Nakamura] [0 point] [Was strong that time] Yamamoto, Ayukawa, you, and I... We defeated these aliens dressed in black... ...two years ago in Shibuya. [Yamamoto] [11 points] [Excellent as ever] And then, everyone could stop doing this. We had our memory erased... and were set free. Ah... Yes. So if we get 100 points, we can really be released, huh? [Suzuki] [17 points. Total 101 points] 100 points. "Breaking news. There is an emergency going on currently." "An accident occurred at the subway, causing 84 people to die and 260 people injured." "A group of people bearing weapons were seen on the train." "At the moment, the train has been stopped but the situation inside is not yet confirmed." [100 points menu] [1. Erase all your memory and get released] [2. Return the person you love to life] That means you'll be released. Suzuki-san, with this, you'll be a free man. I'll choose the second option. [2. Return the person you love to life] I'm sorry. First of all, let's revive Katou-kun. No... But, he... I was... killed by him. "This is revenge. You people killed my friends." He said that and killed me. That's the same thing as what the girl said earlier. Then... this Katou is? Let's confirm it. GANTZ. Please revive Katou Masaru-kun. Eh? That's it? Kei-chan. Where's the alien? Katou. Katou. Katou! Oi GANTZ. Hurry up! You mustn't die. I'll wait for you. I'll go first and wait for... Kei-chan. What about the alien? What happened to it? Was I... dead? Was I alive? I'm alive, and I can go back. Suzuki-san used his points to revive you. It's nothing. Well, it's been my objective from the beginning... ...to get 100 points and revive Katou-kun. Thank you very much. Thank you very much! Ah, it's nothing. Anyway, with this, we've made it clear, right? Yes. The other guy is an alien. We will avenge you. I have obtained the key to that room. [Kurono] [21 points. Total 115 points] More than 100 points. GANTZ, I choose number 2. [100 points menu] [1. Erase all your memory and get released] [2. Return the person you love to life] [2. Return the person you love to life] The person I want to revive is... Huh? I have you revived. I was dead? Yeah. That's so uncool! Right now, you're important to us. Now, explain to us. Something strange is happening to GANTZ. You guys... Long time no see. You're still doing this, huh? Why are you here? We were summoned by GANTZ. A black ball was sent to my place. Ex-members like us were brought back here. That's not the only thing. There were people who were dragged into the mission and got killed. This has never happened before. Say, what's going on now? How long have I been dead? Five months. It's gathering people using that ball? What is it? Oi, spill it. Its battery is running out. Huh? This thing runs using battery? From what I observe, even though this is just a guess... GANTZ moves by sucking his energy. That's why, if the life span of this bald-headed guy ends, it's also the end of GANTZ. If GANTZ dies, what will happen to us? That is... Right? Extermination... perhaps. We, who were revived by GANTZ... ...will also disappear together with it. What the heck is that? Maybe GANTZ is rushing too. Before its lifetime ends, it wants to defeat all the aliens. That's why it summoned us ex-members here. I see what you mean. So it's like homecoming, huh? Perhaps... ...the archival still remains. The Last Boss, that is. Don't tell me... ...that is...? Today I met an alien who appeared in the form of your body. Eh? The one who killed me is also... ...that guy. He's an alien. There it goes again. "A new morning has come" "It's a morning of hope" "Open your heart with joy" Today's mission just ended though. "Look up to the blue sky" "Listen to the radio" "Take a deep breath" "And take in the fragrance of the wind" "And then - one, two, three" [Emergency mission] [Go crush this person] [Kojima Tae] [Special trait: Weak] [Favourite thing: Kurono-kun] What the heck? An ordinary girl? Wait, look... Her favourite thing is... What the heck is this? Why is she the target? Shouldn't it be that fake Katou? [People who crushed her will get 100 points.] [The others will have their points taken away.] This girl is... Kojima Tae is not an alien. That's why... ...please don't kill her. Please. She may look like that, but she might actually be an alien. That's not true! The last person who appeared on the black ball... ...was this girl. So that means... she's also an ex-member of the group? No. I've never seen her. Then... she's really an alien? Hang on. Where is that ball now? The one who killed me... So it's with that Katou alien, huh? Isn't that bad? Maybe he already killed Kojima Tae before us. The ones who hold the ball can be transmitted around. Seriously? GANTZ wants to prevent that, right? Anyway... ...if it's GANTZ's order, we just have to do it. If I can get 100 points by killing this one girl, I'll kill Kojima Tae. GANTZ. Transmit me first. Kei-chan. I'll go to Kojima-san. You go to Ayumu's place. Sorry. I'll see you later. Be careful. Wait. You intend to protect her? I want to revive Auntie. That's why... ...I have to gain more points. Stop it! Transmit me quickly. GANTZ! My house? I will explain everything to you later. Right now, let's run away together. Um, what happened in the subway earlier... It didn't make any sense at all. But I believe... I believe you, Kurono-kun. This way! Wasn't that Ayumu-kun's brother? It wasn't him! Urgent! Urgent! Public safety unit 12 calling headquarters. Found one suspect just now. The suspect is heading towards the north direction. The suspect is a man who possesses a weapon and is chasing after someone else. If we don't act quickly, more things will come after the incident in the subway. "Roger." Found you. Kurono-kun. Let's stop this. If GANTZ dies, everyone will be exterminated. Doing this to another human being is just strange. Though you can kill so many aliens? Suzuki-san. Since I'm thrown into this, before GANTZ comes to an end, I will get 100 points one more time. Nice. Kurono-san. Run away. If you move, we'll shoot. No, you won't. Suzuki-san too! Me too? They're shooting! Please go first. I will block them. Sakurai-kun! They won't get any points killing me. Hurry up! I'll catch up with you later. Thanks. I'll aim at him for real. Let's go. [Katou] Ayumu. Ayumu! Ayumu. Ayumu. Ayumu... Calling headquarters. Right now, the suspect is heading further to the north direction. I'm chasing after him. It's me, Kei-chan. By any chance... ...he is...? Suzuki-san. The two of you, please run away as far as you can. Hurry up! I don't want to go! I want to be with you, Kurono-kun. Tae-chan. I will definitely come pick you up later. Let's go. Let's make sure... ...we go to the amusement park. This way! Don't... get in my way. You came to take revenge? Why did you... have to kill Ayumu? You also killed your father. Give Ayumu back! Someone who killed his father like you... ...can get angry when your brother is killed? Because of those emotions... you killed your father. That was to save Ayumu. It couldn't be helped! It couldn't be helped? That's forever your excuse. You always make that excuse... and run away from everything. Katou! Kei-chan. Please tell me. What's happening to Kurono-kun? It's hard to explain, but... He's fighting... ...to protect you. For... my sake? He might... even die. I'm sorry. My wife passed away. I want to get her back. I have to gain enough points before GANTZ is over. Please run away. If not, I will have to shoot you. Kurono-kun will definitely come to pick you up. It doesn't work on him at all. This way! You're in the way. Move aside! I give up! Let's stop. Let's stop here. Okay? What are you shooting? But... But... ...he- [Kojima Tae] "Headquarters calling public safety unit 12. At the moment, we are dispatching special units over." "Please refrain from acting on your own without our command." Oi. Oi! Oi!! You want to know why I killed your brother? This is revenge. You people did the same thing to me. We tasted the same hatred... ...and sorrow. Like me, you people are... ...not fighting for anyone's sake, Nor are you protecting anyone. You're just... ...being controlled by that black sphere. Katou. Kurono-kun! No way... Kurono-kun. I got you. Kurono-kun. Tae-chan. Let's go home. You mustn't... You mustn't die. Kei-chan. Kei-chan. So you're saying that I should keep... ...fighting until forever? That's why, you... ...made Tae-chan your target? You can go to that room using it, right? Hand the ball to me. [Mission cleared.] [Damn it Damn it Damn it] [Someone, crush the alien in this room] In here? Not here. The ones who were supposed to have been killed by the alien earlier are... We finally found you. It is you who wished to start this fight. [Start] I understand now, GANTZ. [Choose] Kei-chan. How about the aliens? I don't think all of them have died. That's great. That's great? Because we have to get more points. What do humans fight for? What do you people fight for? For the sake of my loved ones. When are you gonna keep fighting until? Until... I can revive my wife. Stop it. I have to live. I... People in this world are longing to see me. You're kidding, right? GANTZ. Stop it. Shoot. You people can't stop this fight. Shoot! Stop... ...already. Let's... stop this. Why? There's no way but to kill him. Kei-chan. [Well then, let's see the points] [Kurono] [Full points] [Please choose from the "full points" menu.] [Full points menu~] [Forever...] Oi! What's next? What is it? GANTZ is... ...over? With this... ...no one will be revived. Neither will us. No. There's still... a way out. Kei-chan. GANTZ... ...has decided already. [Kurono-kun] [Thank you] Kei-chan? What did you do? Everything will end. No one will be summoned here any more. You've gotta be kidding me! What did you do? Katou. Thank you so much... ...for remembering our childhood together. I... ...was really happy. But... ...from now on, forget about me. How can I forget? How can I forget?? Katou. Take good care of Ayumu. We're going back together! Together! Kei-chan! Kei-chan! Kei-chan! Thank you very much. Wanna buy something? - Yeah, buy me a map. - Okay. - I'll take them. - Oh, thanks. You think they sell maps? Welcome. Welcome. "Ayukawa Eriko-san returned to the entertainment industry" Don't tell anyone that I'm going through treatment here. Please take some time off for yourself. We will handle the investigation. I know the reason why the superiors want to keep this incident a secret. Eh? They have not found the bullets that hit me. That detail is just vaguely stated in the report of the incident. Regarding that, the headquarters are investigating the possibility... Even the body of the ringleader in the incident that happened in the subway hasn't been found yet. Why wouldn't they want to announce that to the public? Like I said, the headquarters are investigating the possibility that a special type of gun was used. We are also investigating the scenario where the ringleader exited through the route used by maintenance workers. Besides, it's confirmed that all of the members present in your list are existent. I saw them. I saw those guys with my own eyes. That room too. I was just so close. You mean, the room with the black sphere? Even you also believe in that? It's not just a rumour. I don't know which country is giving us pressure, but the superiors know about this and are trying to hide it. Who are those superiors you're talking about? The people above. Sleep tight. I'll continue with the investigation. Then, I'll go with you next time. I have retrieved all the documents. Yes. I also heard about the room with the black sphere. Yes. We will put him in under restriction. For now, I think we can build an official case against him based on his illegal investigation. Yes. I've made breakfast, so you will do the cleaning. Okay, hurry up. Quickly put the mattress away. Huh? Well, just that... it feels as if I haven't seen you for a long time. You're so strange. I have... always wanted to do this. I... ...won't go anywhere any more. I know that already, so go to work. Who... gave me this again? "Draw the Ferris wheel here" "To Tae-chan" "I love you. Kurono Kei" Kurono... Kei? Excuse me. As I thought, it's you. You saved me that day. What do you mean? Here at this place. Thank you very much. Please convey my gratitude to your friend too. Friend? There was another person with you, right? Thank you so very much. Goodbye. Kei-chan...? Kurono... Kei. [Everyone, please be happy]
