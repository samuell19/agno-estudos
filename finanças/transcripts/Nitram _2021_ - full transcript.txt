OK Scott, what happened to you? How'd you burn yourself? Um... I was playing with some fire and... I had petrol 'cause it was a rainy day and, uh, the fire was... the petrol was too close to the fire and... the petrol caught on fire, then I panicked. Then the petrol can slipped over and it went a big line of fire on the thing and I jumped in it and it burnt my legs. And then I just ran down to the hose and I turned it on and I put it full speed and I just put the fire out. Then I just ran next door. How's your treatment been? You've had skin grafts, haven't you? - Yes, three. - And has that been OK? Yes, quite well. It used to be very itchy but it's OK now. Will you be playing with fire again? No way. OK, what happened to you? How'd you burn yourself? I was going up to my bedroom and... I wanted to see - I had this light and I had this coloured sky rocket and I wanted to see if the wick went quick so I lit it. And it went fast and I tried to make it go out but I couldn't, and... I... tried... I broke the stick trying to get it out but I couldn't and it made holes in my jeans. You'll be in here for a while longer, won't you? Yeah, about a week. Do you think you'll play with firecrackers anymore? Yes. Don't you think you've learned a lesson from this? Yes, but I'm still playing with it. Nitram, shut the fuck up! Dinner's ready. How many fucking times do I have to tell you, mate? Don't! No! No! Don't you fucking do that! I want you to take them off him. It's not doing any harm. You give those fireworks to your father. No wonder the neighbours hate us. Since when do you care what the neighbours think? Anyway, won't have to worry about that for much longer. Have you talked to the bank again? They've agreed to the loan. Does that mean we've bought it? No, it means we can buy it. Just have to, um... get the paperwork sorted out. Right. - How long will that take? - Oh, not long. A few odds and ends. Didn't I tell you to put those trousers in the wash? They're filthy. Leave it be. I'm sorry, we're not eating until he's put them in the wash. Go on. Take them off, pop them in the wash. Well come on, we can start. No, I'll wait. It's not enough. It's money for nothing. What do you expect? It's your usual amount. What's it not enough for? Why do you want that? You've never surfed in your life. - You don't even swim anymore. - I want it. - I scuba dive too. - No, you don't. - Not anymore. - Yeah I do. All that equipment's just bloody rotting in the shed. That's to keep it safe. I'm not wasting any more money on another one of your bloody things. I'm your mother, I love you, but surfing's not for you. What's your name? It's Riley. - It's a pretty name. - Thanks. Who's your friend? No idea. Hey Jamie. You surf here a lot? Hello? I'm starting a lawnmower business. Would you like your lawn cut? Oh, no, thank you. No, thanks. - Why not? - My Dad did it. - My husband does that for us. - How much does he charge? Yeah, it's my husband, so it's free. - Oh. - It's his house. I could wait till he comes? You could, or you could... There's a few houses down that way as well, so if you wanted to go and have another knock... - Yeah, but yours needs it too. - Thank you. Have a great day. Can you please remove your foot? Thank you. Sorry. - Have a good day. - Thank you. Hey! Go Nitram! Come on, Nitram! That's it, Nitty! Oh, my God! Nitram! Get away from there! Boys, no! Boys! Boys! Get away! - Get away from it! - Hey, that's mine! No! Hey! - In! Get inside. - What's wrong? - Hell are you doing? - What do you mean? You can't just be letting off fireworks outside a school, Nitram! It's not appropriate! Hey, stop it! - Look, your Dad's here. - Stop it! Get in the car. Get in the car. We used to go to school together. I know. Get in the car. Get in the car. I'm really fucking sorry. Mate, he just needs something else to do, alright? He can't just be hanging around schools like this. No I know, I know. I promise it won't happen again. - OK? - OK. Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop it! Come on! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! I told you, just stop! What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? - What's wrong with him? - What's... - He hates me. - He doesn't hate you. Hey! He just cannot have his students playing with fireworks at lunchtime. Stop it! Mum told me to do something. Yeah, not this. Just... - Did you tell her? - No of course not. I'd be in trouble if I told her that I gave them back to you. - They're my friends, though. - I know. - I know they're your friends. - They're my friends. - I know they're your friends. - They like me. But you have to promise me. I can't keep my eye on you all the time. OK? I tell you what. We'll go for a nice drive, alright? That's what we need to do. We need to go for a nice quiet drive. Alright? OK. Beautiful, eh? Be good tourist trade from the mainland. Good money. You're gonna help me run it, right? Yeah, good. Can we have animals? - What kind? - Farm animals. Chickens? Eggs? - No, cows. - We could use the eggs. Cows? What do you know about cows? Nothing. - What do you know about cows? - Nothing. You silly boy. I'm a silly boy? Yeah. You know, if one day you settle down or something, you could have kids. Good place to bring them up. You know, this place will be yours one day. I really want this one, mate. Thanks for coming in today. I know it can be hard for you guys to make it in. Look, I was wondering how you were going? How he's going? You're taking your medications? Yeah? Tricyclic? Antidepressant, once a day? - Are they calming? - He's run out. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they do. They calm him. - Yeah? - It makes life easier. Makes like easier for him or for you? Everyone. So I wondered if he was at a point where we could stop the tablets. He needs his tablets. A way to help not just with the medication, might be to see someone, to talk about things. Sorry, are you talking to me or Mum? - You. - You, silly. Oh. You getting any side effects from the tablets? Are you feeling normal on them? Alright. Um... Look, we need a new letter from you because otherwise Centrelink will stop his pension payments. That's alright. Look, first of all I'll do the script for the medication. You know the Tricyclic - that you've got to take it every day and that'll keep your mood good and stable. Thank you. And you, Carleen, how are you coping with all of this? Are you going alright? I'm fine. Remember, you can come and see me as well to talk about things. No, I'm good. I'm starting a lawnmower business. Would you like your lawn cut? I don't know. Is that your cat? This is Gilbert. Hello, Gilbert. May I? Hello, Gilbert. Soft. It is a bit unruly, isn't it? How long will you take? I'll be real quick. There's a lot. There's more out the back. That's OK. I'm a hard worker. OK. Come in. Do you cut a lot of people's lawns? Yeah, loads. I'm really good at it. Would you like me to close the door? Yes, please. Good girl. Good girl. OK. Come on. It's not working. It's not working. - I'm sorry. - Never mind. Do you walk dogs? Ah, yeah. Yeah, I do. Maybe you could come back tomorrow and walk my babies for me. OK. I'm Helen. My hands are dirty. OK. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. I'm really sorry. Doesn't matter. Come on, babies! Lyric, Amby, come! Come on! Come on, Betty. Lunchtime! Come on, come on! Come on. Inside. Good girl. Do you play? Nothing? Not even Chopsticks? Everyone can play Chopsticks. All you need is two fingers. Come sit. And you make them look like Chopsticks. Hmm? And you get them here. Then this one moves to the E. Then to the D. And a little skip down, C. Back to the middle. You did it. Now you can tell people you can play the piano. You look like a movie star. I was on telly once. Really? When? When I was little, I burnt my hands playing with fireworks. The TV lady came. Asked me loads of questions. - You're famous. - Nah, not anymore. Do you want to come shopping? These were my father's. How do I look? Very nice. You look like a businessman. My father used to take me driving in his convertible when I was little. I used to desperately want to be a racing car driver. - Do you like this? - Yep. Here she is. Good old Helen. Helen, you're back. Good to see you. How are you? - It's beautiful. - Beautiful, isn't she? C Class. Driver, passenger airbag. Want to take it for a spin? - How's it feeling, Helen? - It's lovely. - Driving nicely? - Beautiful. Are you comfortable? Yeah? That'd be the power steering. - This the sunroof? - Yes, absolutely. - Button's just there. - Yeah, I know. This one? - This the lights? - Yeah, just there. Look at that, Helen. - Safe as houses, Helen. - Yeah, safe as houses. Driver, passenger airbags. How's the steering? Hey! Hey! Stop it, mate! Don't be stupid. Don't call me stupid, mate. You have to try before you buy, Helen. - Hey! Stop it! - Keep your hands to yourself. Listen to her. Hey, stop it now! Helen, pull over! - He's just excited. - Pull over now! - Just excited. - Stop it! Pull over! - I'm pulling over. - That's it! Pull over! Fuck's sake. Sorry, he's... - What's wrong? - You shouldn't do that. That's it. We're done. Out. Out now! Get out! Out! That's enough! We're done. We are done! - Let him... - Get out! Thank you. Having fucking fun? Havin fun? Next time she's here, you make sure you're not, you fucking little retard. You fuck with one of my cars again, I will fuck with you. You got it? You got it? All good?

We're just watching a movie. Is something wrong? Just wanted to say goodnight. You got a headache? Why are you taking pills? Mum says they help. With what? Are you sick? No, I just get sad sometimes. 'Night, Helen. Night-night. Oh, yes. That one. I picked these for you. Thank you. Oh, how lovely. This is Helen. Helen, Mum. Dad. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. A bit wet. Yeah, it's cause they're fresh. I've heard a lot about you. This is for you, love. I like the colours. You look like a superhero. Sexy? I got you something too. It's our star sign. You know our birthdays are only nine days apart. - No, I didn't. - I'm a bull, Mum. Do you want me to bring the cake out? Maybe, maybe after. - Alright. - Thank you, sweetheart. OK. No worries. Happy birthday. I got him something else, too. More gold? Something sweet I know he'll like. Goodness, you know a lot about my son. When you live with someone, you... What exactly is going on here? Sorry, I don't know what you mean. He mows your lawn, you buy him a car. He mows it again, he moves in with you. What's next, marriage? He needed a car. He doesn't have a licence. I didn't know that. Yes, well I guess you don't know everything. Don't you have your own children? No. What about a husband? So which is he? A husband or a son? Dear, we came here to get to know our son's friend. And I'm trying to do that. Which is it? I got him collared. Look! Agh, agh, agh! Do you have a problem with me? No. I've got a question. Why him? What do you like about my son? He's considerate. And helpful. Funny. He's a special man... ..and a dear friend. When he was a little boy, we used to play a game at the fabric shop in town. He'd go off and hide in all the big, tall rolls of fabric. And then I'd try and find him. He was about five. He loved it. I loved it. We used to play a lot of games. That sounds beautiful. But then this one day... ..I went to find him. and he wasn't there. I looked everywhere. Not in the silks, not in the cottons. Nowhere. I just couldn't find him. Ran into all the shops. Strangers were stopping to help me. I looked for him for over an hour. Tears streaming down my face. I was hysterical. Well, you know... I mean, that's the worst thing, isn't it? A mother losing her child. What did you do? I gave up and went back to the car. I was going to drive to the police station. But then... ..I heard someone laughing. I looked around... ..and there he was... ..lying on the floor of the backseat... ..looking up at me, laughing. Laughing at my pain. Laughing like it was the funniest thing in the world. Watch out for your hair, mate. You did promise me you were going to help run it. - Hi, Maurice. - Hi. How are you going? Um, I tried to call, about Seascape. Yeah, no, I've got everything. Sorry it took so long. There's been a change of plans. What do you mean? The B&B sold. Another couple bid on the property. Theirs was larger than yours. I wanted to save you the trouble of coming down. Why wouldn't I come here? The vendor took the bigger offer, so the B&B sold, just not to you. You told me that the place was mine. Mmm. For a while, it was. But while we were waiting for you to organise financing, a new offer came in. - Can I match it? - No. The paperwork's already gone through. Well, I promise to keep my eye out for something else. Yeah. Well, take care and I'll call you later. Yeah. Thanks. OK. Come on, mate. Let's go find another one. - What's that? - What? In your hand. It's my air rifle. Where'd it come from? My Dad got me it when I was a kid. Get rid of it. I don't want it here. Can you buy me a real gun? I beg your pardon? This one's boring. No. I don't like them. But I want it and you have the money. That doesn't matter. It's my money. Then I'll use my own money then, after I've mowed the lawns. Not for buying a gun, you won't. I won't pay you, if that's what you're going to spend it on. I don't want guns in my house. But it's for our protection. I've lived fifty years without any protection. I don't need any now. Helen? Helen, it's me. Sorry, Helen. You don't have to give me a gun anymore. We can go to Hollywood, where they make our favourite movies. You really want to go to America? I want us both to go. Like a family. Like a real family. Fine. We can go to the travel agent in the morning. OK. Stop!

She said she thought Dad had seemed a little bit out of sorts recently. Had you noticed him acting differently at all? Bit quiet, that's all. Three, two, one. Were you close with your Dad? You might want to go and have a chat to your Mum and I'll come and ask you a few more questions a bit later. It'll be nice. Here's my son. Excuse me. Sorry I'm late. What are you doing? What? Get that off. What? Oi, stop it! Who comes to his father's funeral dressed like a clown? I'm not dressed like a clown. I'm dressed nice. You are not going to embarrass me today. Look, it's got wolves on it. And a forest. This is funny to you? No. Go. You're not going to ruin today. I need to say goodbye to Dad, though. Go. OK. Excuse me? Good afternoon! How are you? Please have a seat. How can I help you? - I'd like to go away. - You'd like to go away? Sure. Whereabouts would you like to go? What state or country were you looking at... Helen and I were going to go to Los Angeles. You'd like to go to Los Angeles? - To America. - To America? Yep, absolutely. And when were you thinking of going? Now. - Now? - Yeah. - As in today? - Yeah. Yep, sure. OK, let me have a look and I'll see what I can find for you. - OK. - First class. - Oh, first class? - Yeah, first class. OK, let's just have a look here. I've got a really good seven-night package here including hire car, hotel. This enough? Oh, yes, that's plenty thank you very much. Full buffet breakfast. Would you like me to book that one for you? I'm a businessman. You're a businessman. Do you travel a lot? Yeah. We were going to go first class. Oh, you're going with somebody? Or you're just going on your own? - You said 'we'. - Would you like to come? Would I like to come with you? Yeah, you can come with me. I could buy you a ticket. Oh, no, sorry, I'm way too busy. That's OK. I understand. I'm sure you could take a friend with you, or a partner. So... So is it just for one person? Yep OK, no problem. We'll book that in for you. I got you this. I know you and Dad always wanted to go. I miss him. Why didn't you cry? What? When the police found him, you didn't cry. How come? Just because I don't cry doesn't mean I'm not hurting. What about you? Why didn't you cry? Do you even... miss him? No. He really loved you. Not enough to stick around, though. He was so unwell. So? Everyone else feels shitty all the time. Walks around feeling fucking sad. Why couldn't he? I don't know. If anyone should have walked into that dam, it was me. I'm the one no-one listens to. I'm the retard. Oh, don't say that. You and Dad would always argue about it, wouldn't you? No we didn't. Slow means the same thing, Mum. You're no different than all them kids who called me Nitram at school. Well, that's not true. I'm your mother. Oh. Yes, I gave birth to you. And sometimes I watch myself... ..but I don't know who... ..who it is that I'm looking at. Like... ..I can't get to him. If I could... If I could just change him so that he was like everyone else, but I don't know how. So instead I'm... I'm here, stuck here, like this. Eating this shit, talking to you, all because I'm not a coward like him. Hey... Mm-hm. Oh... I don't understand what you're... talking about. It doesn't matter, Mum. Neither do I. So, uh, what can I help you with today? You after pistols? Shotguns? Semi-autos? See that one just up from the bottom, in the middle there? The one in the middle? The black one? That's the AR-15. That's a semi-auto. That's basically the civilian model to the M-16 that they used in Vietnam. So you've got the sliding... ..butt, so you can move it up and down. Nice and light. Straight into the shoulder. Beautiful weapon. Takes .223 rounds. Thirty-round mags. - Do you want to have a look? - Yeah, can I? Yeah, of course you can. Just watch where you're pointing it. We'll just... OK, make sure she's clear. Yep. And without getting your fingers in the way, you press that button. Bang, she goes. Alright? There you go. Now just before, just before, sorry. Safety's out. Alright? So just make sure you get it right into your shoulder. Right in here. Yeah. Get your... One foot forward. Lean into it. Hang on, hang on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm just mucking around. Just... - Alright, lean into it. - Yeah. Push forward. Just breathe in. And as you get to the top of your breath, just squeeze the trigger. Perfect. So, what do you think? All good to go? What do I think about what? What do you think about the gun? - I like it, I told you. - You like it? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah? Are you interested in buying it? - Yeah. - You are? OK, beautiful. You ever shot anything like this before? - Yeah, once or twice. - What did you use? I used, um... a rifle. - Was it a .22? - Yeah, it was a .22. OK. You've got to understand these things have got a bit more kick than a .22. - And was the .22 semi-auto? - No. So you know the difference between a semi-auto and auto? Yeah. Yeah... An auto you just pull the trigger, and you'll just empty the mag. OK, with these you've got to click, click, click, OK? - Yeah. - Each shot. The whole lot together, five grand and I'll give you eighty rounds of ammo as well. The price OK? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. What have we got here? That enough? Oh, yeah, OK. Yep, that's fine. No dramas. Is there anything else you're after? - Shotgun. - Shotgun? Yeah, OK. Well I think we've just got some new shipment in. So we'll go out and see Larry out the back. Do you want to go out and have a look at those? - Yeah. - Yep, alright. No dramas. This is the Daewoo 12-gauge shotgun. Ten-round mag. Just the dust cover there. Just up to the shoulder. Bang. Click. Have a go of that. Be aware it's a lot heavier than the AR-15. It's cool looking, though. It is, isn't it? Nice and modern. So same as before. Be careful there. You've got to hold it and you've got to really control this one because she's gonna kick. She'll kick like a mule. So lift it up. Keep it up high. Make sure you're looking through. And same as before with your breathing. Same, just gently squeeze the trigger. That's it. Perfect. Alright. - What do you think? - I like it. It's good. - You like it? - It's heavy. OK, so what I can do with this one, it comes with a strap, I'll throw in a bag. You're looking at three grand for that. Five grand for that. - OK. - Right? So a total of eight thousand. - OK. - Yep, OK. So have you got your gun licence? No. You don't have one at all? - I don't have one. - You don't have one? No licence. - Ah, OK. - I've got this. Yeah, I know you've got the money. That's fine. That's not a problem. - No look it's... - If you need more... No, no, you're not registering the rifles? What? You're not registering these rifles, are you? - No. - No. - OK, so that's fine. - We don't need to register it. No, no. You know, if you'd wanted a handgun you know, there's no way I could have sold you a handgun, alright? So... Larry, can you do me a favour, mate? Can you just get me a couple of boxes of, um... - .12 gauge? - .12 gauge for that. - No worries. - Get a spare mag. - Yep. - Four rounds .223 for that. - .223s, yeah, four of those. - Yep. Yeah, no worries. Four and two. And just a nice bag for each, I think. - Two mags. - Two mags, yeah, yeah. - Two mags for each. - Yeah, and a bag. Yeah, two mags, including that one. - OK. - So just an extra, alright? Yeah, cool. - That's it, easy. - Alright. - Too easy, mate. - OK, good. - Alright. - Pleasure. Thanks for your business. He can do that and we'll go do the money. No worries. Hey, Jamie. What's going on? Come here. This is for you. It's for you. Come on. It didn't cost me much. Take one. Whose is all that? It's yours. I got it for you. Take one. Just take one. What's wrong? Hi, Helen. Hi, Helen. Hi, Helen. Hi Helen, I'm home. I'm home. Hi Helen, I'm home. I'm home, Helen. Hi Helen, I'm home. I'm home, Helen. Hi, Helen. Hi Helen. Hi Helen. I like your smile. I like your smile. I like your smile. I like your smile. And a youth club he ran was closed down 10 years ago amidst allegations he interfered with young boys. What had happened was beyond this community's comprehension. Scotland's Chief Constable gave an early assessment of the enormity of the loss. A terrible set of circumstances occurred at Dunblane Primary School this morning. There was 13 children dead, and two adults and a number of children in hospital. And while Britain mourned the deaths of the innocent it also struggled to find someone or something to blame for what had happened. The man who ran amok in the school gymnasium was well known to police and locals. A misfit, a loner, an oddball, a weirdo - just some of the descriptions now emerging. He was mistrusted for his obsession with young boys and with guns. Evil visited us yesterday and we don't know why. We don't understand it. And I guess we never will. People just wept on the streets, and there was fear, with mothers and fathers running. Some ran towards the town's primary school in terror of what they might find. Others hurried away, clutching their children, glad they were alive. What's this one? That's the... AR-10. - AR-10? Yeah. That's a little heavier. Yeah, that's a bit heavier. A bit longer. Different style. Different weapon made by different people. Like Ford versus Holden, you know? It's a preference. But the same twenty-shot, semi-auto. It's good too, though. It feels good. Yeah, nine hundred for the AR-10, or fifteen hundred for both. That's with the three mags and I've got some boxes of ammo. I'll chuck in some ammo for you. It's a good deal. - Fifteen hundred? - Yeah. That's one hundred. Three hundred. It's good. Well done. Hello. I bought pies. What are you doing tomorrow? It's the weekend. You should do something. Why don't you go dancing? You used to love dancing when you were a kid. Might meet a girl. Or maybe you... I don't know, maybe you've got a girl already. I have. Oh, what's her name? Riley. - Riley? - Mm. That's a nice name. How did you meet her? At the beach. - Really? - Yeah. Well I'm glad you got that surfboard, then. You could have asked her over for dinner tonight. Look at what you've done. It's really amazing. You've even cleaned the windows. Goodnight, love. Come on. Come on. There we go. Come on. Get down. Come on, let's go. Come on. Sorry. What can I get for this? Uh... fruit cup and a juice. That OK? There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. With 25 people confirmed dead it's believed to be the worst mass-shooting in Australian history. The nightmare unfolded around half past two this afternoon.
