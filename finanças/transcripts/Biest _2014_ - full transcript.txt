If my mom would find out that we meet, she would be very angry and Daddy too! 300:00:49,083... &gt; 00:00:50,166 He's not supposed to know... that we're spending so much time together. I would be grounded until I've finished college for sure. Oh Tiffany... I would never let him do something like that. Oh Touch, my father doesn't like you and you know it. He's not supposed to find out that we love each other. Never! He would certainly hurt you. Do you know what? We're gonna move away from here. The people of Oakville Village will never understand how deep our love is. We could live with my Cousin. I don't know. Do you think it would be the right thing? In my whole life, I have never been so sure about doing the right thing than I am now. Oh Tiffany, I love you! Oh Touch Oh Tiffany Oh Touch What was that? Oh God! What if that is my father? I'm gonna check. Do you remember when we drove to the cabin the first time? That was really nice. That was a long time ago. May I .? I got this. Ok. Did Kathi tell you where the key is? She said it's somewhere on the windowsill. It looks just like the last time when we were up here. Kathi and Gerd aren't up here often, right? No. I don't think so. It looks just the same. Don't you think? Can you tell me what's inside your suitcase? Your shoe cabinet or why it is so heavy? I wanted to carry it myself. I was only kidding. We could walk over to the lake before it gets dark. Actually I wanted.uhm.. Maybe we're going to see a deer again? It's really crazy when you think about how high the water is in the summer time. What do all the fish do when it's frozen over? They hibernate. Yes of course. Yes. Yes? Some of them are digging themselves into the ground others are just floating around to burn as little fat as possible until the ice melts in the spring again. Jeez. But I really don't think that we're gonna see a deer today. Can we go home please? I'm so cold, I need a shower, I want to unpack. For real. Fuck. What? What is Fuck? Wah... What is this? I think that was a deer. A deer? What has happened to it? Got eaten. What is eating a deer up here? I have no idea. Wanna play "Settlers"? That's stupid with only two people. Last time we had so much fun. And there were only the two of us. What are you doing now? I'm pretty tired I'm gonna read and then sleep. I've prepared everything already, and now you're leaving? Lena, please, at least one game? And this is the way the westsiberian Punchthornbug got his name. He's not only a really fast hunter but a very insidious one too. Once he has found his bait, he gets close and fast to it until a few centimeters; to raise his back part in this moment he pushes his wings at the animal in such a fast way that it's not visible to the naked eye. The poisoned stingers are hidden in the wings and then thrown into the animal. Once they hit the animal and stick into it, it takes less than a minute until the first paralysis phenomena kicks in. When the bait is completely paralyzed... he takes it to his nest, located far under ground... to eat it calmly when the time is right. Lena? Yes? Who's knocking? There's a man with a gun standing at the front door. I think I'm in the wrong movie. Hello. Hello. Sorry to bother you, but... I would like to speak to Mister or Mrs. Schober. Ok. They are not here. We are friends of the Schobers and are here for the weekend. Oh. Good Morning. Morgen. Schenk. My name is Franz Schenk. My wife and I have a Buschenschank a little bit away from here in SÃ♪dingberg and that's how we know the Schobers. I think the Schobers have us told about you. You have a huge gun collection right? Yes, that's right. Should we tell the Schobers something, Mister Schenk? Look. This is my wife. Maria. She has been missing for more than a week.. The police haven't found anything yet. And I'm afraid that she got hurt in the woods or something else happen to her have you seen or heard anything since you arrived? No. When I saw her the last time she was wearing this scarf. Unfortunately we had a fight. I'm sorry but we haven't noticed anything. Thank you. I don't wanna keep you any longer. Please tell the Schobers greetings from me. And if you see or hear something you know where to find me. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. That's horrible somehow. Maybe Maria was just running away. Had enough after 40 years of being together. I thought with this weather it's certainly beautiful up at the Reisinger and there's a lot of snow still. I would like to go up there later... Maybe you want to come with me? I really like that we came up here together again. Do you remember the last time when we talked about how cool it would be to have a house up here? And you were excited about it. Because of the air and at Christmas when the whole family would be up here.. You were only against it because you were so afraid that Amazon wouldn't deliver up here. Yes, that's right. And that's still the main reason, because I think overnight express isn't possible here. Concerning next week. Is it still on? What do you mean? That you are moving to Kathi's. Andi... can see that you are trying hard. I'm not blind. I really see that, but... it would be so easy if I could forget everything, but I just can't do that. You hurt me so deeply. I can't trust you anymore. I know I have said it often, I'm so very sorry and I'm going to regret it forever. Please give us a second chance. Please. I don't know if the two of us still have a chance. I just don't know. That's all just BlahBlah the whole time. What you do is important. Actions are what is important to me, I don't care about the rest. I have the feeling you don't know me anymore. I don't have a shoe cabinet with me, I do have two pairs of shoes with me like the last time. My mountain boots and my slippers I'm not that type. Andi, I can't do it anymore, I can't. Lena. Lena! Lena, please talk to me! Leave me alone! I can understand that you can't trust me anymore, but please, don't move to Kathi! Don't run away, please! At least let's try it again! Lena, please. Think about it. I don't do anything else since you brought me up here, Andi. Since we arrived you keep on pushing me all the time and we pretend that everything is ok. It's really hard for me. This morning when the Hunter was there and told the story about his wife do you know why I was so sad? You chose to be with her... although you knew I was sick at this time... You knew it. But somehow, you didn't give a shit about it. You know, I can't imagine that you would really worry about me. Not even if it would be appropriate. Not now and not in 40 years. No. And that's exactly the point Andi. I do not know it. Fuck. Lena? Lena?! Lena?! Mister Schenk?! Hello?! Hello?! Mister Schenk? Andi from the Schober Cabin here... You came to us yesterday because of your wife. It's about Lena. She's not here. She's missing the whole day. I have no idea what has happened. Maybe someone kidnapped her. I don't know. I'm at your place now but no one is here. I just saw your number and... I don't know who else to call. Please call me back, my number is 06964626444 I need your help please. Thank you. Oh shit. Lena? Lena? What happened? It.it's sitting there behind and sleeps. Back there. Please don't be mad at me. But we need to get out of here. We need to go now. The Beast sees like shit. Lena, you have to help me, I can't anymore... Hold me a little, it's ok. Help me up. Are you ok?! Have you seen my wife? At least I know it now. What are you doing? You can't go in there. It's useless. Who knows how many beasts are still in there!!! Take care of your wife. I do have more than just this gun with me. Can you walk? I think so. Let's go.
