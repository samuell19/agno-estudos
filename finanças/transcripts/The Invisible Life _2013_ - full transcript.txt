There was a night when I couldn't face going home. Astonished that my life could have turned out like this. It was right at the end, after everything had happened. The images from the films kept coming back. As if they were telling me something. And I needed to know what it was. They were António's films. Old Super 8 footage that I discovered in his house. António... THE INVISIBLE LIFE António. I was wondering why you always sit there. You could sit somewhere else... but no. I think you believe this will last forever, these meetings, these conversations. I am having problems with this report. See? What? If you could read what I've done and tell me tomorrow what you think... Hugo! I think the problem is... Hugo, I won't be here tomorrow. You will be by yourself. Why? Because I have to go to the hospital. I'm having surgery again. Well, we'll see if this doesn't end up like I think it will. Don't say that. Everything will be okay. Do you think? Yes. Trust yourself. Finish that report. Everything will be okay. I always felt a great relief when the others all went away, and I was left alone in the building. I liked the empty corridors... the distant noises... losing track of time. But that night... Why had he told me that? It was as if António wanted to tell me something that I didn't want to hear. I felt separated and far away from something that I had, and still desired to have, although I didn't know what it was. António didn't know me. He knew nothing about me. There was a day. A summer's day. Perhaps two years ago. Yes, Hugo Macedo. Can you still put that call through please? Yes? Go on. Yes. Yes, please. Okay, I'll wait. Yes? Adriana? I'm in Lisbon. Yes. Passing through. Don't worry. I'm sure I'll find it. Goodbye. I began to have sleepless nights. Hugo Macedo? Yes? Good Night. Good Night. I'm nurse Paula, can I help? I wanted to know about António Sarmento. The surgery went well. I've been told that it took too long. Yes, some skin tissues were very weak, which we weren't able to stitch. There was some bleeding. He is now in intensive care. How long does he have to stay there? We don't know. Well, but that's normal. How long have you known him? We work together. Are you friends? When can he go back to work? Do you know? We are running some tests and... Well, when the results are not what we expect, the doctor prefers to speak to the family first. - Yes, but António has no family. Yes, I know that. He gave us your name as the next of kin. - My name? Good night. This is difficult to say. But I didn't want to be with him. I didn't want to speak to him. António. Unexpectedly I had a dream, I who never had dreams. Lots of love, bye. You have white hair. I had noticed that. What? I wanted to see you. Why? Don't ask me that. Let me look at you. Why today? Why? You are still so angry. I'm curious. I've missed you. That was all it was. It was a stupid impulse. I've never thought that after all this time you would… What? I… have to go. I really have to go, it's true. You can eat the cake. It was a low late afternoon light... that only spoke of distant things. And I... How are your evenings going? Listen, maybe I can help. Did António suggest that to you? Did he, Sandro? Is it true that he is having surgery again? Do you think he will come back? And why wouldn't he come back? The way things have changed around here, the third floor is already empty, have you noticed? This must be the next one to go. Where are you living anyway? In Amsterdam. And do you like it there? Yes. Yes, I like it, I like it a lot. Do you have a bicycle? Of course. What color? Metallic blue, with purple highlights, it's beautiful. Do you ride it a lot? I really enjoy going to the North Coast. I go on some fantastic trips up there. Are you with someone? Will you invite me to dinner? I have to go back to the hotel. Shall we go back? Adriana? Yes? Do you still draw your skyscrapers? I'm not into architecture anymore. You're not? I gave up. You know... the day I called you. I wanted to see... I wanted to see, even if it was... Even if it was only... If you... What you were feeling. Even if it was only for a moment. What do I want? I don't know. I know I have to make some decisions in my life. For instance this choice to work as an air hostess - what am I doing with that? Should I carry on or not? I had... I made mistakes and wasn't thinking clearly during all those years. Do you know how long it was? So much happens in six years. You seem lonelier. How do you know? I feel it. And is it bad? It is. I can't hide myself from life like you Hugo. I can't. I wanted to go there, I had to go there. But I didn't want to know the results of the tests. Is he...? You can wake him if you want. I'm sure he'd like to see you. What about the tests? Bad news, unfortunately. The doctor explained everything to him this morning. Will he have more surgery? It won't make any difference. So...? You already know. And did you finish the report? I only hope it happens quickly. If I didn't finish the report, maybe António wouldn't die. Adriana. Let's go home. You really like the darkness Hugo. There's sunshine outside. Everything looks exactly the same. So... What are you planning to do? To take you to dinner. You still have the aquarium. You can change in the bedroom. I'll be back. Hugo? Hugo? And if one day I could not remember António? If I could not remember all that had happened in my life? So? How's the new office? It's okay. With whom do you share it now? Raul, Jorge and... I can't remember his name. Yeah. Have you been told where they will put you? And are you doing anything about it, or are you going to wait and see what happens? What about you? I like changes. This is starting to get a little deadly. Don't you think? Yes, little by little. Yes, but this death thing, you never know. It suddenly happens to you. Hugo? It's António. How are you? I'm sorry, but I have something to ask you. I wasn't expecting this would be so... so quick... so fast... What I wanted to ask you was if… if you could take care of my things... You know what worries me the most is my house. Certain things... that I always got used to. All that furniture... All those rooms... Certain objects... You see? The pictures... The earrings... and my mother's bracelets. Lately, at night, I've been thinking about these things. And also about the people. I think about them a lot. People I knew... Maybe you'll even find something for yourself at the house… There are so many things. Ah! I will have to give you power of attorney. Although I don't really understand how I'm going to do it… You can come and we can sort it whenever you want… or whenever you can… You seem very quiet Hugo. How is your life? When you come if I'm not in the room it's because I'm out in the courtyard. I prefer the light there. Ok. Goodbye. She phoned and told me that in that week she was not going to fly to Lisbon. I thought... She was frightned of my sadness. When I arrived António had already gone into a coma. Not those. The man who doesn't like surprises. It's not exactly that. The man who hates the unexpected. No. If you want I'll put everything back, and you won't even notice. You should sell this house. I don't use these rooms, I live on the other side of the house, the one that faces the street. Oh, Hugo... Leave this house. Get rid of it. And go where? What's the point? You prefer to stay here, living with the dead. You think they need you more than the living... That's not true. I want to be with you. I want to be with you. I know. But there is this force pulling you… that is always telling you... that it's safer to be with them than with me. You have to go to work, right? I do. I have to go to work. I have to go to work. I didn't want to lift my head to reply. Because I guessed what I would read in Sandro's eyes. António had died. I truly wanted to hear what he might have said to me. It was as if António had never been there. As he had never existed. António's house was in the Anjos. It was a building from the beginning of the century at the top of a steep street. The door was number 86. And António lived on the second floor on the left. I closed the door behind me and peered into the darkness of the rooms. There was a state old smell, the air trapped inside the walls of the house. Normally I would have spent more time looking at the furniture and all other objects, but I realized that I could not bring myself to do it. The idea of lives already lived and forgotten began to oppress me. It was an enormous house and everything seemed to be waiting his return. But António wasn't coming back. It was me who was there. Suddenly, I felt... I would be the man that António had been. I imagined someone coming into my house after I had died. Who would that person be? Who would that person be? What should I say to someone at the end of my life? I wasn't there to say goodbye to António. I wanted to say goodbye to myself. To the man who used to sat there, always in the same place. I looked around the office, the papers, the sofa, without sadness. I looked at them feeling how they existed in their strangeness. And how they still were there. It was as if I, and not António, had created those images. The films seemed to belong to a part of my life now forgotten. They spoke of a long journey which I have made in pursuit of Adriana. Always hoping – at each new horizon that I might meet her again. But film after film, not one image brought her back. These images, only confirmed the thing I most feared. I would never see her again. But it was only later that I realized all of this. The works in the square had been finished. I remember well, looking down on it for a long time, that afternoon when I went back to get my things, after I had been fired.
