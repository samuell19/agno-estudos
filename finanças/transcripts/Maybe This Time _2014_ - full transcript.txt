It could've been just another summer. But as I set foot on the sand, that summer suddenly felt different. Like it was going to be the summer that would change my life. The summer of freedom. The summer of endless possibilities. The summer of 2007. Ooh, aah! Ooh, oh! ♪ Oh, oh, ooh ♪ That was the summer of you and me. You're quite the dancer. Why did you stop? Come on! Keep dancing! Whatever! I'm kidding. Don't get mad. Huh? What... Hey! I'm just going to get my towel. What? Stop that! You thought I was gonna kiss you. No! Excuse me! I wanna kiss you but not just yet. What do you mean "not yet"? Only when you're my girl. - What do you mean your girl? - My girlfriend, Miss. As if! You wish! And don't call me miss. Don't pretend to be a gentleman when you're clearly not. So, what should I call you? Rude? Snob? Bitch? And you? Douche? Handsome. - Conceited. - Just like you. - Huh? Jerk! - Exactly your type! Leave me alone. Steph! Aha! Steph! I'll just call you Tep. Remove the "S" and the "F". By the way, I'm Tonio. Will you still be here tomorrow? Don't leave yet. I'm going to court you. I chose to walk away from you. But fate had a different plan. Councilor… We're teaching basic English literacy. We'll be teaching the children how to read and write in English. - Is that so? - Yes. How long will this program run? If it's okay, the entire summer. I thought I could escape you. But you somehow found me again. Tep? What are you doing here? You couldn't resist me, huh? So you're courting me instead? Excuse me. I'm not here to court you. Oh! So, you're here to be courted. - Yeah! - No. Uncle Tonio, she's the one who will teach us this summer. Don't believe that story. That's just her excuse to get me to date her. Gramps, Uncle Erning, Aunt Elma, this is Tep. My suitor. - Approved? - Approved! - You passed. - Mmm. I don't approve. - Excuse us. We'll be going now. - All right, my dear. - Thank you, sir. - We'll go ahead. Excuse me, please. Oh, no! - Tep! - Tep, are you okay? I said, "Excuse me!" We're not yet a couple and we're already fighting. - He has a point. - Oh, Tonio. - Seventy… - Snacks! - Seven… - Seven… - Silvery… - Silvery… - Sheep. - Sheep. Do you know what that is in Filipino? No! Filipino: "Seventy-seven silvery sheep." Why say it in English if you can say it in Filipino? Because they need to learn how to read, write, and speak properly in order to make a living. Why are you here anyway? Tep, they don't need to learn that to make a living. Instead of seventy-seven slippery… What? What did you say? Instead of teaching them that, you should just teach them how to swim. In a sinking boat, English proficiency won't save you. You'll be dead. As you're well aware, that's not part of the lesson. So, why are you disturbing us? So irritable! Why are you so hot-headed? Maybe we should just go swimming. - Sounds fun! - What? Hey, kids! Do you wanna go swimming? Yes! Swimming! Swimming! Swimming! Okay. You really want to swim? - Do you wanna swim? - I do. - Let's go. - You first. So that's how you want it. Swimming! Swimming! - Hey, Tonio! - Swimming, swimming! - Put me down! - Swimming, swimming! So this is what you want, huh! - Wait a minute. - What now? Wait, why are you hugging me? - You want me badly, huh? - Of course not! What now, huh? Hey, stop it! What now? Come on! - Take this! - Tep! What happened? Oh, no! Uncle Tonio stepped on a sea urchin! You saved me, you cared for me, and you made me feel alive. Tep, have you tried this? I've never seen caramel flan used as a bread filling. Once you taste this, you'll surely fall in love with me. - Really? - Yeah! Who would have thought? You may be unlucky at finding a job, but you're very lucky at finding a girlfriend. You look good together. You heard that. We look good together. That means we're a couple. - Mmm? That quick? - Why not? But you haven't officially courted me yet. So, can I court you? Well, you did save me a while ago… Of course I would save you. I'd rather get hurt than see you get hurt. So? Can I court you now? - Mmm. Fine, sure. - Yes! Ouch! Why'd you do that? I'm okay. Are you sure? - Here. - Okay. Thank you. - Kiss. - Huh? - What kiss? - I'm talking about the bread. Oh! - Whatever. - Kiss. You surprised me there. Mmm. - Good? - Mmm. It's good. Told you so. - Slowly. - Mm-hm. - We're almost there. - Okay. - Are we there yet? - Yeah. - Keep your eyes closed. - Mm-hm. One. Two. Three! Wow. It's beautiful, Tonio. - You like it? - Yes! You know, this is my favorite spot in this town. In fact, this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. - Mmm. - Until I saw you. Nice. Wow… - You're just teasing me. - It's true. I've got one more surprise for you. - There's more? - Yes. - Just look at me. - Okay. - What's that? - Blow. - Blow? - Yeah. Oh! It's so cute! Give me your hand. I don't have money to buy you flowers so I got this instead. Tep, starting now, I am courting you. Okay. Where did you buy this? It's so pretty. I made that. - You made this? - Yes. Really? You made this? Yeah. You want to see how I made it? Sure. Wow. These are beautiful. You made all of these? Wow. You've been doing this for a long time? My dad started this, but I also developed a knack for it. You know, Tep, once I have enough money from working as a seaman, I want to set up a furniture shop. That was my father's dream. Really? Wow. I'll be your first customer. Wait, question. Why do you use old wood? I don't like seeing these pieces of driftwood go to waste. Most people see these as rotten, old, and useless. But when you really stop to look at them, that's when you will see their true beauty. Unfortunately, not many people do that. A lot of people think these are junk. They just throw them away like trash. You captivated me through the beauty of your dreams and the kindness of your heart. And slowly but surely I was falling for you. Ah! Sorry! Sorry. Does it hurt? Sorry. Every moment we spent together felt like happily ever after. This won't take long, Tep. I will cook my special chicken skewers for you. Tonio, huh. Hey, why are you erasing it? This is how you should do it. T heart T. Tonio loves Tep. And vice versa. Teptep loves Tonio. I know, you love me too, right? But I know you won't admit it. - Tep, do you see it? - Mmm. - You like it? - I like it. - Let's go. - Let's go. I didn't know where we were going but I was just happy to be wherever you were. Hold on tight. Oops. - Start paddling. - Are you serious? I'm just kidding. - Come on. - Okay. - Are you tired? - A little bit. You? Hey. Steph, how are you? - Steph. - Brother. - You okay? - It's her family. Daddy, what are you doing here? I was suddenly given… - You surprised me. - …a vacation leave. - Porky! - Hi, Ma'am! Hi, Sir! - So how's your vacation? - This isn't a vacation. This is an outreach program. Where's Abby? - Sleeping. - Asleep. Steph, who's that hunk with you? The one you were holding hands with. - Is he your boyfriend? - No. Stephanie, introduce your friend to us, will you? - Mom's right. - Okay. Tonio, come here. I'll introduce you. Do I need to watch over you? Really, brother? Tonio, my family. - Good evening. - Good evening. You know, Tonio, you should put a bench here so we have somewhere to sit. Or maybe a swing. That'll be cool. Hey. Are you okay? Why are you so quiet? Was my family too much for you? Oh, no. Your family is fun. I'm actually jealous. I just wish I had a family like yours. Happy and complete. It's a shame, Tep. I can't introduce you to my mom. She left us when I was just a kid. I don't even think she knows I exist. She wasn't happy with a simple life. That's why she left me and my dad. Come here. - Tep. - Hmm? What if this is it for me? What if this is all I can be? Can you live with that? I knew at that moment, I wanted to be part of your world and I wanted you to be in mine. Hey, you. You said you would only kiss me once I'm your girl, right? You're something else! Here. Okay. Tomorrow, we'll meet up here again. So I can give you my answer. Why not give me an answer now? Because once I give you my answer, there's no turning back. It's forever. So, you need to seriously think about it. You need to be sure. Can you love me forever? Of course. If you want I can even love you forever and forever and forever. Mmm! What about you? Can you love me forever? Mmm… And slowly our worlds were becoming one. Ouch! Wait. Bad ant. He got to kiss you first! - Mommy! - Steph! It's so late. We've been waiting for you. Come on, let's eat. Where were you? Up on the hill. Oh, it's beautiful there, Mommy. - You should see it. - Okay. - Oh, Mommy. - Mmm. - Mommy. - Yes? How did you know that Daddy was the man you're going to love forever? I tried to make our summer last forever. But all seasons come to an end. That's the story that inspired my presentation. In fairness, that's so good. - Your pitch is fabulous. - It's beautiful. I can feel it. Your delivery is top-notch, sis. - You think so? - Of course. I feel it, too. No matter how many times I've heard it, I'm still affected by Teptep and Tonio's summer to remember. Also known as the summer to forget. - Forget? - To forget? Hello, guys! That was seven years ago. Let's move on! If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't be able to move on until I found out what happened. He didn't show up because he got on a ship. - That's what his family told me. - There you have it. You mean to tell me you never saw each other? You never talked again? No. Not yet. Actually, there's no need for it. You do need it. For closure. Sometimes, not having closure is the closure. Wow. Who I am and what I have right now, that's the reason why the things that didn't happen never took place. We will let the emoticons tell the story. How embarrassingly corny and cliché. - What do you think? - It might get rejected. Right down to the stupid names of Tonio and Teptep. - Really now? - Here she goes again. Is there anything else? Um, Miss Monica, that's all we... Steph, I gave you one chance to come up with a brilliant marketing campaign. Are you pitching me a soap opera? No, ma'am. It's for a web series. Three minutes each. With a cliffhanger at the end of each webisode. And to determine how the next webisode will begin, we'll have a text poll using Kakao emoticons. Uh, for example, if boy and girl will meet again, how will the girl feel? A, angry? B, surprised? Or C, very angry? Text the emoticon of the reaction you want to see in our next webisode. How is product usage depicted in your series? Your story was set seven years ago. During that time, KakaoTalk was not even in existence. Miss Monica, this is just the back story... Do you really think that this is what the target market would like? Dump the entire thing. Give me something better. Don't waste my time or the clients' time. - Catch my drift? - Mm-hm. Here you go, a gift from Aunt Steph. Wow! Thank you. You're welcome. Share that, okay? - That one. - Put that here. - Where's the sauce? - It's here. - No, it's for the chicken. - Mommy, here's your pork buns. I'll just eat that tomorrow. You know, all of you need to learn how to save. Your father's been out of work for many years. We have so many payables. Bills, rent, your tuition. The tuition of the kids. Mommy, relax. It would be good if the businesses you got into were actually profitable. And do you think you'll get rich by selling perfumes and make-up? That's not even enough for my grandkids. And you! Get your dad. It's time to eat. Come on, let's get this ready. Okay. Don't mind your mom. It's enough that you bring food for us. In fact, she really likes the steamed buns that you bring home. Did you leave some for me? Of course, Daddy. I'll forget everything else before I forget your steamed buns. - Ouch, ouch. - Oh, Daddy. Are you okay? Where does it hurt? It's fine. I'm okay. I'm okay. I promise you, Daddy, once I get promoted, and that's very soon, I'll take you to the U.S. for medical care. I'm fine. I don't need all of that. Daddy, I want you to be able to walk again. Steph, I've been in and out of therapy for seven years. We've even prayed in Manaoag so many times. I think it's impossible... No. Nothing is impossible. You will be able to walk again. Okay. I will try to walk again, as long as you try to fall in love again. Well, maybe, I'm already in love. With whom? Secret. Howard, our Skype date with the band is next week. Uh-huh. Yes, actually, there's 70 to 80 members of the entertainment press that are gonna be there. From Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Hong Kong. Sit properly and use your chopsticks. - Uh-huh. - Babes, hang up the phone. Eat sushi with me. I can't. I need to finish this now. I wasn't able to work on this because you pissed me off earlier. Yes, Howard? Of course. I can take them to Boracay and Palawan for some rest and relaxation. Mm-hm. Bye, Howard. Babe, you're so naughty. - You're lucky you're cute. - What do you expect? You force me to learn to use chopsticks. You used to find it sweet when I use my hands to feed you. I want you to learn how to use chopsticks because I love Japanese food. What will happen when we go on a date? You're gonna use your bare hands to hold the sushi? Sorry. Okay. Have you thought of what kind of business you would like to invest in? Yes, babes. I talked to Uncle Erning. He's going to request a business permit for the furniture shop. Furniture shop? What kind of furniture shop? Driftwood. - That's always been my dream. - Driftwood? Yeah. We have a lot of those back home. That is not going to fly. So, babes, what business will I set up? Babe, first of all, it's "Babe". Singular. There's only one me. And also to answer your question, you have to invest in something both trendy and relevant. What's that? A bar. A high-end bar. You know the Manila party scene is booming right now. Ants, the Italian you took care of left you 40 million in his will. But that 40 million will easily vanish if you don't take care of it properly. Actually, it's not even 40 million anymore. Because you bought this house. Then, you also bought one for your family. Then, you bought a car. I just don't want you to invest in something that will surely fail. Babe… I've been with you six months now. When have I ever been wrong? Hmm? So much drama. Okay, fine. Mmm! You're so dramatic. Ah! Miss Monica? Um, you asked me how we can make the national campaign a success. What if we do a Metro Manila campus tour to see if our target market will like the web series. We will set up booths to provide Wi-Fi to those who have downloaded the app. You've got to be kidding me, Steph. The client has done that before. I know, ma'am, but... Do not give me rehash crap and say that it's improvement. You've been asking me about a promotion. With these ideas, how can I promote you? Anyway, I have a more urgent project for you to work on. I have a new client who wants to open a high-end bar, and I want you to personally take care of his account. I want you to do the PR of the bar and its owner. - Okay. - And if you do well, maybe I'll give you the vacant Account Executive position. Really? I said only if you do well then maybe I might promote you. - But this is confidential. - Yes, ma'am. - The bar owner is my boyfriend. - Ah. Mm-hmm. You see, I met Anton on a cruise ship a few months ago. He's not used to how it is to live in my world. Now your job is to transform him so that he can mingle with a high-end crowd which is the target market of the bar he's opening. He speaks a little bit of Italian, and English is not his first language. It's your job to teach him English as well. Yes, ma'am. Can I trust you with this? Yes, ma'am. Don't mess this up or else… Catch my drift? - Waiter. - I'm on my way. Waiter. Hi, sir. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Stephanie Asuncion. Sir Anton, right? - Anthony, actually. - Pleasure to meet you. - May I take this seat? - Sure. Thank you. All right. This initial meeting is basically for us to discuss your vision and goals for the business you hope to launch. Miss Monica informed me that you wanted to open a bar. Are we talking about a restobar or is this a club or lounge? Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was talking my head off. I forgot that English is not your first language. Uh, did you understand any of that? I understood, actually. And English isn't just my first language. It's my only language. Hi, honey. Uh, this is my wife Gina and this is...? A very stupid person. You're not my boss' boyfriend, are you? He better not be or I'm gonna kill him. Honey, I'm not cheating on you. I'm telling you the truth this time. I promise. This time? So you admit that you've been lying… Stupid, Steph. Where's my cell phone? - Okay, I'll follow up on table... - Ah! - Sir, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, ma'am. Sir, wait a minute. - Hold on. - I have a lot to do, ma'am. Teptep? - Tep. Teptep! - Uh… - Tep! - No, no. I'm okay. Thank you. Just a thank you? Uh… Sorry? Tep, it's Tonio. Oh, yeah. Tonio. Hello. - How are you? - Hello. I'm good. Great even. What are you doing here? Well, it was nice bumping into you but I have to go because I have a client who's waiting for me. Bye. - Tep, wait. - Yeah? Let's talk for a while. I'm sorry. I have to meet an important client. I can't and I don't want to attend to you right now. Bye. - Hello. - Hello, Sir Anton? Good afternoon. Tep? Is that you? To... Tonio? Tep, it's been awhile. Steph or Stephanie. Stephanie. Tep is fine. Steph is too formal. Well you are a client, Sir Anton. Sir Anton? Tonio! It's like we don't know each other. Okay, so… Tonio. How are you? As I said earlier, I'm good. Great. Okay. And you? How have you been? I'm good. What have you been up to since I last saw you? I heard you became a seaman. Yeah. I worked on a cruise ship. So that's where you met Miss Monica, right? Good for you. Tep, if you're uncomfortable just tell me, okay? I'll just ask Monica to find someone else who can help me. Of course not. There's no reason for me to feel uncomfortable. Right? Don't worry, Tonio. Relax. Mmm. By the way… I want to say sorry. Sorry? For what happened. Why, what happened? What do you mean? When… When… it was us. Us? Was there an us? Back when we were together, when we had an M.U.? M.U.? Hmm? M.U., mutual understanding. No, no. I think your M.U. stands for Mis-Understanding. Gosh. Sorry. Sorry, Tonio. There was never an "us". Look, if this makes you feel uncomfortable, I can just talk to Miss Monica about this - and tell her... - Oh, no. I'm fine. No problem. M.U. your face! M.U. my ass! M.U., messed up! You are one big mistake, Tonio! A huge mistake! Huge mistake! Wow. Good day. Uh, is Tonio around? Mmm… Mmm… I like you. You got my vote. Are you the new girlfriend? And by the way, I'm Mama Mae. I'm Sir Tonio's all-around helper. In by day. Out by night. - And you are? - Stephanie Asuncion. Ah, Stephanie. Hey! My sir is there. Tonio, you have a visitor! She's very beautiful, we are so alike. - Mama Mae. Tep. - Hello. Have you been here awhile? Sorry for making you wait. No, it's okay. I'm used to waiting for you. I'm actually surprised you came. Hi, babes! - It's babe. - Ah, Babe. - Is Steph there already? - Yeah, she's here. I'm embarrassed 'cause I made her wait. - Are you good? - Don't worry, I got this. - Okay, bye. - I love you. Oh. Oh. You should have told me. Told you what? I thought you were a couple. Mama Mae. There was never an "us". Right, Tep? - Exactly. - Mm-hmm. Hmm? My job is to present you to your public in the best light possible. To communicate the right message about your business and about you. We're doing this interview so I can get to know you and make everything clear. To avoid confusion. We don't need another M.U. - M.U.? Weren't you... - Misunderstanding. Mis-Understanding. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. So, why do you want to put up a bar? So that I can make Monica happy, because... - You love her. - Yeah. You love her? Why? What do you like about Miss Monica? Yes. I ask myself the same question. Why do you love that woman? I don't get it. I actually get it. She's beautiful, powerful, and most of all, she's rich. - What are you trying to say? - Exactly that. And you. What does she like about you? Oh! That. That I get. It's because my Sir Tonio... Ah! Maybe it's your job. 'Cause Miss Monica is known for dating accomplished men. Where are you working? I'm currently jobless. So you're not working now because you're with Miss Monica. That's why I'm opening a business, right? Which you haven't even thought about. - I know what I want. - Yes, you do. My rich boss. What are you getting at? I wasn't getting at anything. Uh, I just wanted to know… If I'm after Monica's money? If I'm just using your boss? You said it, not me. I am not using Monica, but that's what you're getting at. The truth. Because if I misunderstand you once more, I'll look stupid again, right? You have that effect on me. You make me look stupid. Huh? What? I just want to do my job properly, okay? Job? Is this your job? To insult me? If that's all you're gonna do, let's just end this. Okay. Fine. All right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Wow. I felt that. She had a lot of resentment. - You know, you two need to M.U. - M.U.? Make Up. Mommy? Hey, sis! Where's Daddy? What happened? His sides started hurting all of a sudden, then he turned pale. So we rushed him here. Mommy? Mom, are you okay? Doc, how is my husband? He's fine for now. We are doing some tests and it seems he has stones in his gallbladder. We need to operate on your husband. What we have to do is schedule the procedure immediately. Based on what Anton said, you broke every single rule in public relations. I'm sorry, Miss Monica. Please don't fire me. I ought to fire you, but I won't. Because I'm giving this project to Liana. Miss Monica, I need this project. It doesn't seem like you want it. Miss Monica, please don't take the project away from me. I'll prove that I can do it, that I'm deserving of the promotion. Please, Miss Monica. Please give me another chance. Don't talk to me. Talk to Anton. He's the client. And as far as I'm concerned, he doesn't wanna see you. He doesn't wanna have anything to do with you. So, good luck in trying to convince him to take you back. What? You got something to say? I'm too busy counting all of Monica's money right now. Please forgive me. Please give me another chance because I really need this job. Here. A peace offering. And this, too. Mmm? Thanks. Tep… Are you mad at me? 'Cause your insults really hit home. You know, it was my decision to wait for you. I made that choice. Eventually, I realized that I should be mad at myself. Because… I chose to be stupid. I'm sorry that I left you hanging. You know… I completely understand that you had to board a ship for work. But to leave without saying a word? You didn't talk to me or come and see me one last time. I found that hard to accept. And I waited for you. I even told myself… You'll explain everything to me because you love me. But come to think of it, I realized you never once told me you loved me. So, it was stupid of me to assume that you loved me. Oh, well… I guess when someone courts you it doesn't mean he loves you. I did love you. Oh well, the past is the past. Let's leave it behind us. It's been seven long years. Anyway, it's better this way… Because if we ended up together… I might have been a hindrance to you. Hmm. You might not be as successful as you are now. Tonio, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry for everything I said. It's okay. We're good. Mmm. - High five! - Kiss. Mmm. Hi, I'm Stephanie Asuncion. I will be your PR specialist. And you are? - Tonio. - Anton Bugayong. Anton? It doesn't sound like me. That name doesn't suit me. Not yet, but we will do something about that. Just relax. That's the kind of bar you and Miss Monica want to set up. And as the owner of the bar, that's also the image you'll need to project. And the first step to achieving that is appearance management. You are the brand ambassador of your business. So, just like your bar, you have to be posh, modern, and cool. - Posh. Modern. Cool. - Indeed. That's the look we're going for. I'll take care of him. Please sit, Sir. - Okay. I'll go ahead, Mama Mae. - Tep. - What? - Where are you going? I've got work to do. I'll be back later. Don't worry. I won't leave you high and dry, unlike you. - I'm leaving, too. - And where are you going? I'm just going to buy some dried prunes. These are killer outfits! - Why? - Mama Mae, these are better. No! These will suit him better. Look at them. No way! I won't wear any of those clothes. I like these. The action star look. No, no, no, no. You're not wearing that. You're wearing these. These will look better on you. No, you're wearing this. No, no, no. I'm wearing this. - I'm wearing this. - No! - Dried prunes? - Just kidding. Mmm. So, do I look good? You need to improve your communication skills. Being handsome isn't enough. Oh! That's enough for me! More than enough, actually. It's not enough for you? So, you think I'm handsome? Why? Aren't you? Just making sure. Hmm… Hey. Tep, wait. Tep. Hold on, hold on. Am I so handsome that you can't help but kiss me? Excuse me. I'm not gonna kiss you. You need a facial. - Facial? - Ouch! That's gonna hurt. If you can tell me in straight English why you don't want to wear these, I won't force you to try them on. - Okay! - Go ahead. I don't like because… Because? It doesn't my… unlike. You doesn't you like... Unli... unlike? No. Fine. Give me that. I like! It doesn't! It should be "It don't," right? Stay still, Sir. Tep, this really hurts. Why am I doing this again? Because you love Miss Monica, remember? You know, as they say, love hurts. Wow. - Looking good. - Hmm. So, what do you think? - Do I look good? - Mmm. Modern, cool... What's the last one? - Posh. - Posh. Posh it further. - Mama Mae... - Yeah? I'll posh you up too. - Me too? - Mm-hmm. Let's posh you, Mama Mae. - Ow! Ow! - I'm sorry. It hurts! We will be done in a bit. Ow! Ooh! Ow! My hand. It hurts. - Sorry, sorry. - Sir, please hold still. Look. Yuck! - Dinner fork. - Good. - Salad fork. - Very good. Mmm. Okay. Let's try it without the cheat sheet this time. Go. What's this? I thought the chopsticks were hard, but this is harder. There are so many of them. Don't worry. With practice, you'll be able to memorize all of these. - Ta-daaa! - Yes! Wow! What's that, Mama Mae? Flowers. I'm kidding. It's food, of course. A dish made by Tonio. Peppered pork. - Tonio's specialty. - Wow. Especially for you. Wow, really. Tep, what fork should we use to eat this? For this? Hmm… We'll use our hands. - Oh, Mamae! Let's use our hands. - I will use my feet! Your feet? Mmm. Okay, I'm done. I'm so full. Thank you. - You liked it? - Hmm, delicious. But I think we should take a walk to help digest the food. Yeah, walk around. Take a walk around the whole house. Go ahead. I had no idea you knew how to cook back then. When I worked on the cruise ship, I was assigned to the kitchen. - That's where I learned to cook. - Hmm. So that's how Miss Monica fell for you, by putting a spell on her food during her cruise. Of course not. That's not even where we met. We met in Orvieto, Italy. - What? In Italy? - Yeah. I only spent one year on the ship, then I hopped off. I ended up working as a caregiver. Then I met my employer. He looks like your grandfather. That's why I felt at ease taking care of him. Did you have a hard time taking care of him? Not really, but it's the loneliness that will get you. There aren't many Filipinos there. Plus, Señor Luigi's vineyard was in a provincial area. Oh. Last year, his closest friends visited him. Monica was with them. But after a few days, Señor Luigi passed away. Monica was the one who helped me. She really surprised me. She didn't mind doing the work. Washing the dishes. Serving the funeral guests. - Really? Miss Monica did? - Yeah. Really? She doesn't seem to be the type. - Hey, she's not like that. - Thank you. I think you're talking about a different girlfriend, Tonio. You just don't know Monica like I do. So, why did Miss Monica tell me that she met you on a cruise ship? Maybe because that's where we bonded. When Señor Luigi died, he left me a lot of money. And he left strict instructions for me to go on vacation. So when Monica told me she was going on a cruise, I went with her. That's where you got to know all of Monica? Meaning, that's where you meddled with Monica's mufflers? Mama Mae, so... so, what? I'm just worried about you. I just don't want you getting hurt by Tonio's answer, because, you know? Mama Mae, whatever Tonio says will have no effect on me anymore. And obviously, that's where they... They first… you know. - Right? - First what? First time you meddled. Meddled with? - The mufflers. - Whose? Monica's. - My gosh! What are you saying? - Ouch! - Disgusting! - Sorry. My God. I'm sorry. I'll just shut up and drink my coffee. Hello, Babes. I mean, Babe. How are your mufflers? I mean your... It's Mama Mae's fault. You know, you may not be feeling hurt, - but I am hurting for you. - Mmm? Mm-hm. It's going well. I'm learning a lot. She's just a bit temperamental and strict. Oh, my God. Anton, is that you? Yes, Babes. That's me. Ants, "It's me." Not "That's me." Sorry, Babes... uh, Babe. Do you like this? I love it. You look so hot. Did Steph pick out those clothes for you? Yes. Steph is really good. I'm learning a lots from her. Except for good grammar. But you look so hot anyway. Tep, did you get the thing I sent you? You sent me something? Guys! There's a special delivery for Steph! - Hurry up. I want to have some. - So sweet. Caramel flan! - Sir Anton, your card please. - Thank you so much. The package just arrived. - This is too much. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Monica was so happy last night. Sorry, I wasn't able to drop by. I had to wire money to Grandpa. For his medication. It's okay. Thank you for the food you sent. And that other thing I sent? - Has it arrived? - Other thing? There's more? - Flowers for Steph! - Is it there yet? Excuse me. I have flowers for Miss Monica T. Valencia. Tep, are they pretty? Do you think Monica will like them? What if we use stickers to tell the web series that I previously pitched? Why do we have to burden the client with creating a new product? That's not part of their directives. However, I would like to congratulate you on the work you've done on Anton. - Major improvement. - Thank you. But it's not enough. His basic English still needs work. Mmm, will he be ready by tomorrow? I'll make sure of that, Miss Monica. It is our first time going public tomorrow, and I don't want him to make a fool out of himself. Mm-hm. Ma'am thank you for attending our event. No problem. How about you, Steph? Will you donate your hair? Of course ma'am. Later. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Thank you, sir. Wishing you're here… (Is my English correct?) Oh, your kinda-ex misses you. I'm not the one he likes, remember? So you admit it? You're still hoping that he likes you. I knew it! No... No. I didn't mean it that way. Sorry. I'm at an event. Wait. I'll just text back. But we'll see each other later, right? Go, girl! Meet with him. You know you want to. - Excuse me. No, I don't want to. - Come on. We won't judge you. You're just friends, aren't you? Friends? Friends? Hi. Sorry, I'm late. I couldn't use my car today so I took a taxi. Then he dropped me off at the wrong entrance. So? Let's review, before Miss Monica gets here. - Let's go? - When did you get a haircut? Earlier at the event. Come on. Let's get a table. - Wow. Hmm… - Tep. Wow. - Steph? - Oh, Sir Andrew. Hello. Tep, who's that? That's Sir Andrew. One of my bosses. He's the ex of... Wow. In English, please. The guy who broke Monica's heart. - Hey! - Sounds good? - In straight English, I may add. - Of course. It's Miss Monica. Hello, Miss Monica? I'm here with Sir Anton. Okay. Are there a lot of people? Um, no, not really. Miss Monica, Sir Andrew is here. Huh? - What is he doing there? - I think he's on a date. Um, okay. Well, I'm still in a client meeting right now, so I won't be able to make it to dinner. What? Can I just talk to Anton, please? Okay. She says she can't make it. - Hello, Babes. - It's Babe. Singular, remember? You told Steph to set this up. I prepared for our date, and now you can't make it? I know but I have an important client meeting. More important than me? Look, I don't want to fight about this, okay? Let's just talk about it tomorrow. Just try to understand. Fine. I love you. Okay, bye. Are you okay? Are you angry? No. Just hungry. Let's eat, Tep. Let's order. You know, Tep, I don't understand Monica. She dislikes it when I call her "Babes", but she keeps calling me "Ants". Singular. There's only one me. - You full? - Super. Tep, thank you for all your help. It's just too bad Monica didn't see what you've worked so hard on. What you have worked hard on. Thank you. Oh, you have a meeting tomorrow with MTV's friend who wants to invest in your bar. Why not have your date with MTV after the meeting? If you want, I can make reservations for you. Tep, what if I set up a furniture shop instead? That's what I really want anyway. It's just Monica who thinks it's a waste of money. Huh? It's not a waste of money. You're very good at that. I promise you, once your shop opens up I'll be your first customer. - Really? - Sure. I'll even do PR work for you for free. - Really? - Uh-huh! You know, I think you just need to show your work to Miss Monica. I'm sure she'll be impressed. Why not bring her to your province? Oh! Why are you still up? I'm just editing a video presentation for a client. Mmm… Uh, by the way, who drove you home? My new client. - He looks like... - Like Tonio? Mm-mm. - That was Tonio, Mommy. - He's your client? My God, Steph! He's nothing but trouble. You need to get away from him while you can. Unbelievable. Go to the province with you? What? Why? I'll introduce you to my family. I'll also show you my woodwork. I want to prove to you that setting up a furniture shop won't be a waste of money. I just can't see myself running a high-end bar. Is this because I missed dinner last night? So you're backing out? Is that it? Monica, I'm not interested in setting up a bar. Then study up on it. Why do you keep insisting on this furniture thing? Monica, you're my girlfriend but you don't seem to have faith in me. Unlike Steph who has complete faith in me. Ants, sorry. I have faith in you. Okay. I'm gonna reconsider that furniture thing. But I can't go to the province with you. Maybe next time, okay? Move my meeting with Mr. Reyes to 4 p.m. and tell him I'm on my way, okay? - Yes, ma'am. - Miss Monica? - Yes? - Can I ask you something? Okay. Make it fast because I'm busy. What? I saw your car outside the restaurant last night. Why didn't you come in? Follow me. Actually, I kind of feel guilty about it. I just wish life was less complicated. When I met him in Italy, I was still heartbroken over Andrew. So when Anton told me he wanted to come with me on the cruise, I was okay with it. Normally, I wouldn't have allowed it because I barely knew him. But, you know, he made me laugh. He made me feel beautiful and special. Have you ever felt that way, Steph? His rural attitude. His corny humor. Even his bad grammar. All of that was so wonderful. That was back then. When we were still in paradise. But not now, when we're back in the real world. It's just better to introduce him to family and friends as a fellow passenger that I met on a cruise ship. There's no way that I would tell them I'm in a relationship with a seaman… Turned caregiver. It's embarrassing. He had an honorable job. Steph, don't be so naive. After all, we're in the world of PR. And that's not the point. This is the first guy who is willing to do anything for me, who is willing to change for me. That's why I really want this relationship to work. But you confronting me like this and planting seeds of hope in his furniture shop. Miss Monica, if you could just give Anton a chance. I did. I told him I would reconsider. But only after I've been proven wrong. That it's not going to be a waste of money. Catch my drift? Steph, I think this is going beyond what Miss Monica is asking of you. This is girlfriend-level effort for a guy you claim to be just a friend. Steph, I'm just concerned for you. This might be another M.U. for you. A Mis-Understanding with Major Uncertainty. - Come on. Let's grab some lunch. - Okay. I might lose some weight. Oh, gosh! I'm super excited! I'm ready for the beach. See? Look at me. I put on sunscreen. Oh... Show a little excitement! I can't believe you! Finally, you get to introduce me to your family. Mm-mm… - Tep. - You're in uniform? What are you doing here? Do we have a session? No, but… I heard MTV can't go with you to the province to see your furniture. Yeah. I'm kind of bummed out about it. Mmm. No, no, no. You're not allowed to mope. I'm here because… I'm going to make sure that MTV will still see your furniture. So, instead of her coming over to see your work, your work will come to see her, okay? I'll do it. - Tep. - Yeah? - Mmm! - Huh? Mmm! Mmm… Oh. Ah. Got it. Yes? - Mmm… - Huh? There's... There's more? No. You still got food. Give it here. I want some more. - You finished it? - Mama Mae. You might get fat. Yes, braised pork. - Tep. - Let's eat. You can sleep in my room tonight. - Huh? - Oh! My gosh! - So naughty! - What about you? I'll sleep on the couch. I'll be fine there. Too bad. You really look good together. Hmm. You should have heard him say "There was never an us." They're fooling each other. You're like a newlywed couple separated by sadness. - That's not true. - No, we're not. Oh, yes, you were. You almost didn't board your ship, remember? Huh? Uncle, that's not true. Tep might believe you. Remember when you were in Manila? You were drunk every night. And every time you got drunk you sang… ♪ Tep, Tep, Tep, Tep, Tep ♪ With matching tears. That's too much! Tep might believe you. Too much? You were too drunk! They even had to dunk your head in a drum of water just to get rid of your hangover. - Hey, Steph got drunk, too. - Hey... You got drunk, Tep? Tonio, you didn't know about that? Because he didn't want to talk about Steph back then. - Okay. Enough. - She reeked of booze. - Hyro. - Right, Mom? Wait. So what if she got drunk? I wasn't drunk. That was when she came back to look for you. The second time she came back. Susan. Three months later. Tep, did you really come back here? Oh, she came back! Wait! You tease them like Tonio doesn't have Monica. - She was even waiting for... - Hyro, that's enough. Don't you remember, Mom? You were the one Tep cried to. Then her daddy came to pick her up. - Okay. Stop now. Stop now, son. - Why, Mom? Can you just pass me the rice? - We have to eat everything okay? - That's right! It seems you're getting thinner. It's very delicious! This is what I missed from Tonio's cooking. This one is good! Who cooked this? Mama Mae, why are you still up? I'm having a hard time sleeping because of this cold. Here. Drink this before someone else catches a cold. Thank you. Why are you still up? My cold is curable. I'll be able to sleep now. But I don't think there's a cure for whatever you're feeling. Kooks. - How are you? - Well, I'm okay. Steph, I would just like to remind you you're doing this for your future promotion. Your past with Tonio, it has nothing to do with it, okay? So, please, don't go back to being stupid, okay?

One, two, three. Go. I don't just work with driftwood, I also work with recycled metal. Like this one. And recycled wood… Like this because… Because… Because… Because there are things you can't just throw away… Because you just can't forget about them… Because you just can't let them go… Tonio, that's not what's written here. It wasn't easy… To walk away… It was the most difficult decision you ever had to make… But at that time… It was the right thing to do. You shouldn't be saying those things. But what you thought you'd lost… Has come back… And you take it back… Because it's precious to you… Because you realize that you still love her… You got hurt? Tep, I know... There was never an us. There will never be an us. So, please, stop flirting with me. Tep, sorry. Sorry if you think that I… That I'm flirting with you… But I'm not… It's not like that… I don't know what to do… I don't know how I feel… It's nothing, Tonio. You don't feel anything. You shouldn't feel anything. And I shouldn't feel anything. Because there was never an us… But we loved each other. Tep, I loved you. Believe me. I loved you. Tonio… You were my first love. Everyone made fun of me. Because we never became a couple but I went crazy over you. Because every part of my body… Was hurting… sad. Every part of my body was longing for you. That's why I came back here. Because I thought you might be here. Forgive me. I got so drunk that night. That's why my dad had to pick me up. He was tired and it was dark. We got into an accident. My dad was paralyzed because of my stupidity over you. And to this day, I'm still paying the price for that stupidity. But even after all the pain you've caused me, I still love you, Tonio. I still love you. You think you're the only one who suffered? The night before we were supposed to meet, your mother talked to me. She told me I would only hinder you from reaching your dreams. But if I really wanted you, then I should take you, but you could never go back to them. It was a lot to take… You were a coward. - I wasn't ready, Tep. - You were a coward. Admit it, Tonio. You were a coward. Because I wasn't ready. What life could I offer you? How was I supposed to give you the life you were used to? That was not the life I wanted. A life with you was more than enough for me. But not for me. Because I love you. Because I wanted to give you a good life. I didn't want you to go through the same hardships I did. You should have said that! I should have heard that! So that I could have told you that I can wait until you were sure, until you were ready. I would have waited no matter how long because I loved you, Tonio! You should have showed up! I waited for you. Tep, please forgive me. Because if I came to meet you, there's no way I could have left you. Tep, I'm sorry. Coming back here was a mistake! You already... You already love someone else. Steph, I'm so sorry. All this time, I've done nothing but hurt you. Please, Tonio, let's stop this. Just tell me it's over. - Steph... - Can you... Can you please stop telling me… That you love me? Just tell me that it's over. Please. It's over. What? You spent the weekend in the province with Steph? Why didn't you tell me? And what's all this talk about driftwood furniture? Monica, this is what I really want to do. And you think you're gonna be successful with it? Teptep thinks I can do it. Even when we were younger she always believed in my dream. Teptep? Stephanie? Yeah, Steph. You knew each other? Even before? That was a long time ago. It's not important. Why didn't you tell me? There was nothing to tell. Don't lie to me. Monica, that's in the past. It's over. We will be launching a web series with cliffhangers, and have a text poll over Kakao to find out how the next webisode should begin. We'll be developing a new group of emoticons to tell the story. It's going to be like an animated short. I smell a promotion. And to generate more buzz, we are going to launch via a campus tour, just like what you did before. I like it. It's fresh and innovative. But what will the story of the short films be? A love story. Girl and boy meet one summer. What do the letters A & M stand for? Anton and Monica. But their love story was cut short that summer. But a few years later, they meet again. So this time, will Monica and Anton have their happy ending? Okay. I like it. And it's a go. Congratulations, Monica. You came up with all that? Yes, I did. And that's why she's the best. Good job, Monica. Thank you. Oh, and by the way, I would like to introduce to you our new project head, Liana Mendoza, our newest account executive. - Congrats. - Congrats, Liana. Thank you, ma'am. - What? - I deserve it. Deserve what? The promotion you gave to Liana. Excuse me? Get out of my way. Everything you presented were my ideas. And you didn't even bother to tell them that they weren't yours! I was the one who put this together. Not you! I was the one who worked on all of them! You worked on all of them, including my boyfriend! Don't you dare deny it. I can see right through you! I didn't do anything wrong. But you wanted to! You wanted to steal him from me! I would never steal him from you. I am not like you. You wanted to go back to the province because you wanted to bring back the past. Oh, yes. I know everything! If that's the case, you should know that it's over. It's all in the past! It better be, because he's my boyfriend now so stop being delusional. You can't compete with me! Don't even try. You lying, backstabbing, boyfriend-snatching slut! Really now? This? Coming from a shallow, manipulative, two-faced bitch! I don't want to deal with this garbage. I'm not done yet. - Let go! - No, you listen to me! Before you call me a liar, it's time for you to come clean. Do you really love Tonio? - Yes. I love him. - No, you don't. Because if you truly love him, you wouldn't force him to change just so he can be good enough for you! Don't even try to... And don't you dare call me a backstabber! I never betrayed you! I respected your relationship with Tonio! So you have no right calling me a slut! - You're fired! - No! I quit! - Tep... - Babe! This is not the right time for you to resign, Stephanie. Mommy… I can't stand my boss anymore. She's so unfair. Not only to me, but also to Tonio. Tonio? What the hell, Stephanie? You almost quit school before. Now, you've quit your job? You're going to destroy yourself again over that man? You're letting him make a fool of you again? Who else will suffer this time? Haven't you learned your lesson? He already left you once! He wouldn't have done so if you didn't talk to him. If you didn't scare him into thinking that he would ruin my life. But don't worry. I won't let myself get fooled again. I won't let myself get destroyed again. I will not love Tonio again even if that's how I really feel. I will do that… Not because I think it's wrong, or because I might get hurt again. I will do it… It's because… I don't want to give you more reason not to love me. I don't want another seven years to go by… That whenever you look at me, all you see are my mistakes. Here, Tonio. This will calm you. Tonio? Are you okay? Are you feeling ill? Maybe you shouldn't go to Monica's party. Mama Mae, I have to. Monica is expecting me. And I've been waiting a long time for this. So why don't you look too happy? You look like you'd rather go somewhere else. Mama Mae, Monica is my girlfriend. I should be with her. It's why I changed, for her. As the saying goes, "Change is good as long as you change for the better." That's in English. This is what's right. This is what should be. You know, I admire your determination to stay with Monica. But if you're sticking to that… You might be stopping yourself from experiencing the joy of true love. Keep in mind, Tonio, determination is not the same as love. Hi, babe! You look great. Mmm! Stand up straight. How are you? Um, are you ready? I want to introduce you to my friends. Come on. Anton, Monica told me you plan to open a bar. Have you picked out a location? We're still looking for a place where we... Actually, Anton is still doing his research. We already know that there's a lot of bars that are open right now. So, we wanna make sure that his stands out. You know Anton, he loves to take calculated risks. Come on, Anton. I know you worked abroad. So, I'm sure you know about taking risks. Yeah. In fact, I've been to many countries. I started working as a... Actually, Anton has worked in so many places. When I met him, he was working for a big wine ranch in Italy. And I thought he was done with it. But, you know, once a businessman, always a businessman. Actually, I'm not sure if I'm a good businessman at all. - But you're right. - But why? I'm used to taking risks. That's what I did when I jumped off a ship to become an illegal immigrant. Oh, he was a seaman before. That's interesting. It was hard, but a lot of people helped me. That's why I have so much respect for wealthy people like you. So when I got rich, I told myself that I should never feel ashamed about where my money came from. Because that was a blessing to me, a blessing given to me by a kind person who accepted me for who I was. You're really lucky then. Thank you for the wonderful evening. Please, excuse me. I have to go. Uh, excuse me, I'll be back. - I think they're having a fight. - Okay. Anton! Anton! What was that all about? You humiliated me in front of my guests! I just defended myself. Because I felt so small. I didn't embarrass you, Monica. You embarrassed me. I was just protecting you from them! Protecting me? Why? Because they're judgmental? They didn't even mind my bad English and my being unsophisticated. But you did, Monica. You think they weren't judging you? They were just being nice to you, but they were already judging you in their minds! But you're judging me to my face. You couldn't even let me speak for myself. Because you're afraid everything I say will embarrass you. Oh, my god! Why are you being so juvenile about this? Is this about Stephanie again? Steph has nothing to do with this. Well, ever since you started working with her you've changed. Isn't that what you want? That I change for you? You make it sound like change is such an awful thing, Anton! Tonio. My name is Tonio. This isn't easy for me, Tonio. This isn't easy for me either, Monica. To admit that I'm not enough, that I'm so flawed in your eyes. The pain I feel right now is the same as when my mother left me, the same pain I felt when I had to leave Steph because I felt that I wasn't good enough for her. Because I love you, I let you change who I was, thinking that once I'm finally a good fit for you, you might love me wholeheartedly. But now, I realize that will never happen. We will never be a good fit for each other. No matter how much I study English, no matter how hard I try to fit in with your friends, and no matter what clothes I wear, I'm still nothing but trash to you. I'm so tired, Monica. Are you saying that it's over? I'm sorry. Daddy. Steph, come here. Steph, it's okay. It's okay to get tired, to get hurt. It's even okay to make mistakes. But you also have to forgive yourself. Daddy. Daddy, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for what happened to you. Steph, I never blamed you, nor does your mom. So stop thinking like that. She just doesn't want you to get hurt again. She knows that even though I got paralyzed, you're the one with the deeper wound. She just doesn't know how to help you. But, Daddy… She still resents me for what happened. Steph. Steph, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I love you so much. I love you, too, Mommy. Stephanie Asuncion, it's time to spread our wings! - Let's just start our own firm! - That's right! - You think we can do it? - Come on, girl. This will be fun! Plus, we already have our first client! Really? Hi, Tep. How have you been? Oh, yes, maybe she's here already. Guys, Steph is here! - Hi! - Mr. Stewart, I want you to meet one of our partners in the PR company. - It's nice to finally meet you. - This is Steph. Oh, hello. It's nice to meet you, too. I'm glad you got to see the exhibit before it opens tomorrow. Let me show you around. It's right this way. - Sure. - Let's go. All the pieces are locally made. - Mm-hmm. - My business partner, who also designs all the furniture, he collects all the driftwood himself. Let's go there. Yeah, there's another display over here. Hey, Teptep. Pssst! Teptep. Why aren't you answering! Rude! Snob! Bitch! Finally, you smiled! Hey, she's looking for me. Hmm. Hey! Your client is waiting for you. Tep. So, this is yours. I'm impressed. You finally fulfilled your dream. Yes. But it's incomplete… Without you. What about Monica? We're through. Tep, I'd like to court you again. I will make sure that you know… That I love you so much. Then, now… And forever and forever and forever. In case it's not clear, all together now… Tonio loves Teptep! Or Teptep loves Tonio. Tep, I'm ready. I know I made you wait. But, I'm here now. Tep, give me one more chance. Please? Of course. - Go, Tonio! - Oh! Oh! Yes! Oh!
