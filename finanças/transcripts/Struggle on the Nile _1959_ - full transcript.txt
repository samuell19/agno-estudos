Many men want you on a big mission Let's go You didn't drop by the field today My dad sold the two feddans Sold them? He didn't tell me He must intend to set you on the boat in his place Do you think I can replace my dad? - Learn, Muhasab - How? I'm too old Who would believe Gad's son can't swim?! It's not your fault Your mom feared the sea You were her one and only That's why she pierced my ear and put earrings on me But your dad rejoiced; he nearly danced for joy He carried you naked on his shoulder all over Luxor What's wrong, Muhasab?

Chief Gad whom we call a kind man incited the villagers to buy a steamer He wants them to profit at my expense! Me! Chief Gad is not alone It's either me or all those villagers I have another idea Sell your boats and buy a steamer like them And be their equal? I, Abu Saafan, the great, will always own twenty boats which travel north and south I'll always be their boss and trample them That's not right, Abu Saafan If you don't like it, forget it Listen, Hisham.. When will Bride of the Nile sail? Dawn tomorrow - Know what you'll do? - Ride with them - They'll drop you in Qena - Then to Sidi Abdel Rehim carnival - Can Muhasab swim? - He drowns in shallow water Drown him, and the whole boat if possible - Where were we? - I drown the whole boat And the money never gets to Cairo.

In two or three hours you'll let me off Why should we get attached to each other? You'll come with us to Cairo Think Mujahed will approve? Mujahed seems harsh, but he has a fine heart - He doesn't like me - How? - Because I love you - How does he know? Nothing stays secret Remember when Mujahed saw us talking and yelled at me? - He was jealous of you - What? The trouble is you kept silent and lowered your eyes Me? - Yes, he has the upper hand - Why? Because you lost the purse He owns none of the money It's my dad's and the villager's Why didn't you take it when he found it? He locked it up At least he can show you where it is I know where it is - No way! - Why? He locked it up in the cellar before me - Which cellar? - The one you're in Right under the bed - Oh my! - What did you think? Muhasab See, let's go Let's return to the boat Let's stay a while Mujahed will awake and not find us We owe him nothing Don't forget he's the skipper It's my father's boat and I have control of it Don't be upset, come along Where to?

Playing while the boat is sunk in mud?! - And you caused it - Me?! - Yes, you and her - It's not her fault Listen, Muhasab, I took too much thinking you might wise up You seem to want me to box your ears - My ears? How? - The ones you had earrings on I'm not young, I'm a man That so? Run along, then Let's go, Nargis Nargis won't return to the boat - Listen, Mujahed - Chief Mujahed My dad owns the boat and I control it Your dad entrusted me with the boat, shipment, money and you I'm not underage to be under your control You're underage till you get to Cairo and get the steamer and you return to your dad and the villagers, understand? - Chief Mujahed - Listen, hag How come a hag? When I speak, you shut up - What are you thinking? - Silence Silence, Muhasab I warned you never to leave the cellar You disobeyed You had it coming! Let's go, Muhasab Will you leave me in this totally deserted place? Full of animals, scorpions, and snakes? Stand at the tip of the island and wave A thousand boats would take you Chief, you started a favor and must complete it; Take me back and I'll never leave the cellar We don't carry women on board.. come on, Muhasab When I speak wisely, heed me Lift the anchor, remove the wooden log Wait, take me with you Help me!

Don't do what you did last time - You're leaving? - Yes, leave me How can you leave alone? I'll row to the shore and leave the canoe there How can you row while feverish? Keep it down, we'll be overheard Why are you going? Did someone offend you? - No, what happened was enough - I can't leave you at sea alone I'll get the money and elope with you - I can't part you and Mujahed - I'll get the money Calm down, darling. Don't be crazy You want Mujahed to send us to jail and say we stole the money? I'll go to Cairo and marry you - And the steamer, Muhasab? - Never mind the steamer Wise up, Muhasab Tie the canoe; wanna run away with the money? She says the steamer and you say never mind? You forgot your disabled father who toiled at sea? Forgot the villagers whose future lies in your hands? Forgot Ward? It's not your fault, but mine I wanted to make a man of you, you turned out a kid Less than a kid >From now on you won't know where the money is till Cairo where I'll buy the steamer and take you on it to Luxor - Come along - It's not my fault I know, come with me Will you kill me?

Muhasab insisted on joining me And? The damned chief Mujahed showed up I returned the purse He insisted on sending me away at midnight My body nearly froze I told you we should have attacked them at Qena and slayed them for the cash We can't - Mujahed can beat ten men - Say twenty! We don't want anyone back home to know we're involved - Listen, I'll return to the boat - How? They'll anchor here awaiting the bridge to open And after that? God will help me You're waiting for me till now? I'd wait all my life I'm so glad to see you Come, Muhasab, come - Qandeel, where's Muhasab? - I haven't seen him - Where could he be? - Maybe he went shopping in town You're asking for Muhasab?

I said we are legally married Go into the cellar We have a marriage contract Go in. What now? How can you do such a terrible thing? Why terrible? Is marriage shameful? It's shameful to choose an imposter to your kin Father said times are changing Does that mean to marry a dancer? How will you support her? I'll work in Cairo Doing what? Selling razors and lottery tickets? Or will her dancing support you? Forgot Ward? The innocent kitten? Don't mention Ward at all How come you're still wearing her cap and chain? Here they are!

Go ahead Hey, you're not drinking tea In one go, so you can be a real man After the stuff drowses them, I'll steal into the cellar and carry her to the canoe and kill her And when he awakes and doesn't find her! Her stepfather sneaked in and kidnapped her - Great, Mujahed - Great idea - Watch out.. what? - Oh my! What's wrong with you? - You're two now - How come?

Come and carry him Chief Mujahed, get up Get up, it's midday How can you leave me till the sun rises? You were fast asleep, tired since last night What happened last night? You took her in the canoe to kill her And you returned on your back in the canoe and she was wide awake cracking such laughs.. hear that? May you be next I love white plumpness More Morning, chief Mujahed Happy morning after See, a live sheatfish Give it, boy. You leave it Leave it, leave it We have lots of fish today Stop, boy.

Answer me Afraid for me from walking alone at night? - I have a question - Go ahead Why did you marry Muhasab? It's my destiny - Love him? - You asked me before and I said yes Why are you waiting? Strike me Last time when you took me on the canoe and wanted to get a breath of fresh air I got suspicious When I saw the rope in your hands, I was sure of what you wanted But I thought you wouldn't have the heart When you lifted the oars I felt you'd bring them down on me I kept giving you alcohol till it numbed your arm and relaxed your nerves and made you lose consciousness I could have tied a rock to you and drowned you but I hadn't the heart either I placed your head in my lap I wished for a long night and to spend my life with you Ever since I set foot on the boat, I've had a soft spot for you How can you live with one man when you love another? My mistake.. I married him for protection only to be buried in a cellar I laugh and play and joke So you can be jealous and have feelings If I tell you I loved you before seeing you, you won't believe How can you love me before seeing me? In your dreams? No, I heard of you You beat two men and retrieved the purse I thought you were strong, clever and wide awake I love alert men I don't know why you don't see me Why? Kill me, Mujahed If that's what you really want, I accept Last night, did you see nothing? - Like what? - Didn't he kill her? - Who? - The dancer I overslept He awoke Tea, chief Mujahed Good morning What did you do? Did you throw her to sea? I didn't kill her What?! Didn't have the heart or is she a waste on killing? The knife must have been blunt Get going, you guys Come, Muhasab - We're close to Cairo - Thank God - What will you do? - About what? After we buy the steamer? - Back to Luxor? -Yes With Nargis? What do you think? I think you should forget this marriage How? I know she pleases and refreshes you That's why you can't see straight What am I blind to? Muhasab, I said nothing But you were never taught before I'll ask you an embarrassing question When you're with Nargis in the cellar do you feel she loves you? Next thing you'll be coming down with us I asked you a question My dad wouldn't dare ask it Try to understand what I'm saying I must have kids to prove to you?! That's no way to talk, Muhasab - What will you say? - Nargis doesn't love you Why did she marry me? To escape her stepfather and go to work in Cairo Listen to me, Muhasab I love you Nargis will escape from you sooner or later Leave her before she leaves you Nargis, will you really leave me? You scared me, I thought you were Mujahed Listen, we're close to Cairo You must learn their customs Knock before you enter Answer my question, will you really leave me in Cairo? Who told you that? Mujahed, right? What else did he tell you? That you don't love me Correct Mujahed is right I don't love you What? I adore you >From your heart? >From the depth of my heart Why then does he want me to divorce you? - Ask him - You tell me I can't.. I fear for you - Of what? - Him Speak, fear nothing I hinted to you before we married that Mujahed wanted me He loves you? Head over heels He told you? It shows in his eyes And I didn't know Did he touch you? I'd have cut off his hand and head That's why he wants me to divorce you? Where's the purse? - The purse? - Yes, my money - I hid it - Where? No one will find out till we reach Cairo It's my boat and my money You're a mere hired hand Where's the money? I said where's the money? Is that so, Muhasab? Are you watching? What's going on? Shame, men. Get moving What's up, Muhasab? What's the matter? Why did you come out? Don't let him see you I said go down Just come along and don't be so hot-tempered Come down Oh, your hand is bloody! It's his filthy blood.. let me kill him Where are you going? He must give me the money before I crush him Don't worry.. calm down I'll get the money Don't let him see your face at all Alright, don't be upset Not at all, my love Who is it? What is it? I want you, Mujahed It's almost day So what? Fear not.. come I wanted to make a man of him and he bit my helping hand Never mind.. I kept his friendship His father's upbringing of me can't be forgotten I carried him on my shoulder, Nargis You're to be thanked.. no one would put up with a son like that What can I do? He and the money are entrusted to me I must return him to his father well I kept silent as I felt guilty towards him The blood I shed revived me and brought me to my senses Mujahed, I've been around a lot and seen many men I never met a man like you your gallantry, manhood You're the one who entered my heart I love you, Mujahed If you really love me, get a divorce I'm willing to get divorced but I want one thing of you Don't leave me.. don't abandon me I can't I can't.. I can't I'm not of your class, we aren't suited at all I accept you. We needn't return to Luxor I'll stay in Cairo You can visit me whenever you sail Once is enough for me No, Nargis.

Where's the money? Enough of that! Have mercy.. stop Stop, stop.. tell them where the money is; save yourself Move.. you and all those aboard will die Throw him so he can catch his breath Speak, Mujahed It's no use You'd better tell where the money is It's not my fault.. I'm not with them Muhasab, help What happened? Why are you out of the cellar? Mujahed took me out of the cellar by force as you slept How can you let him? I beat the hell out of him Don't you set foot on the boat.. I said get off What have you done? Hitting the chief? Stay away.. he's a traitor out to steal my wife Get lost, get out of my face! Where are you going? Let him die, serves him right Lift the wooden log, let's sail Why are you weeping? - Stay away from me - What? I said stay away from me - What's wrong? - Don't touch me Please leave me alone What's wrong with you? We've reached Cairo We must go our separate ways Send me the divorce certificate later - You want a divorce? - Definitely - Mujahed was right? -Yes - So you don't love me? - Yes, don't interrogate me What are you looking at? Drop dead! Let me off I'm sorry for yelling at you - I said let me off - How come? Will you keep me by force? I'm your husband, Nargis You'll take me back to Luxor to milk your cows?! I'll stay in Cairo with you - And how will you support me? - I'll work Doing what? Selling lottery tickets or herrings? Let me off or I'll scream and gather people Why have you given up on me? I said let me off Let me off.. let me off Nargis, calm down.. don't make a fool of me Where's the love that filled your heart? Listen up, and mark my words well I never fell in love What of the lovely words you spoke? I was fooling you to get to the money What? All you wanted was the money? Why else did you think I came aboard? Now there's no money you want a divorce? Not just that You killed Mujahed He wanted to cheat on me with you Not true! You told me so I lied to you Mujahed was a gallant man I offered him to elope, he wouldn't betray you He said Muhasab is all the world to me Why did you let me Kill him treacherously? I wish I let him kill me instead of dying You traitor, death was just right for you! Get lost, where's the money? I don't know What were you doing all this time? Move.. search every inch of the boat Mujahed, I'm glad you're safe Get to work The purse The purse, Mujahed Watch out, Mujahed See anything, men? They've arrived safely They're all aboard Thank God.. Thank God you arrived safely, Muhasab My donkey.. I'm here.. come, dear.. embrace me The End
