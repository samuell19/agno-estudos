Young master... Young master... You're mean. I've been waiting. I'm sorry. I ran all the way from the temple. Feel my heart. You're making it beat. Let it beat hard. You're passionate. I like your hot body. That hurts. Don't bite me. If the priest finds out, he'll torture me. Don't! Why not? Don't do that! Natsu... Don't! What if he finds out we're in love? That would be terrible. Promise me. Say you'll marry me. I promise. I will. I'll marry you. Look, Natsu! This is proof of my true love. - What's this? - My late mother's comb. I'm so glad!

But I have to tidy up the room. Saikei will do it for you. Look at me. You turn me on. What's wrong? That's your favorite. You love to lick and suck it. - I've had enough. - Why? Priest, I'm pregnant. I don't want you to go. But I can't let you have a baby here. The people would get mad at me. Go back home to have your baby. Natsu, I hate your baby. I hate to let you go. Priest, not here! Buy some clothes for the baby with this money. Thank you. You've been kind to me. Natsu... The baby... Is it mine? What are you saying? - Do you doubt me? - No, but... Yes, you doubt me! How awful. Where are you going? I'll have my baby here just to prove it is yours. You can't do that! I'm sorry, I understand. I'm sorry. I know. Don't be angry. I must be going. Take care. It stinks around here. It used to be a swamp. Slugs and leeches crawling on the floor. No place for human beings. So everybody left this place. Except for my family. What's happened? As you can see... ...I left the temple and came home. Natsu... ...you're pregnant. You were kicked out. That's right. Sister... It is not easy to pretend. I'm tired. You are not pregnant! Of course not. I'd never have a child by that priest. Otherwise he would have kept me there. How could you do it? How could you betray him? He's my best customer. He ordered these coffins from me. Don't worry. I have another patron. Did you see it? Yes, I saw your white skin under the bamboo tray, too. Saikei! Don't worry. I won't tell the priest. I'll even cheat Buddha if I have to. Tell him. That's why you can't trust women... My son-in-law is late. He'll be late tonight. He has many customers to visit. Peddling again? He wants to have a shop, but he needs money. How can he run a shop? Does he have a good future? I don't know. He's sunk to living in a dump Like this. He's no good. Get rid of him. Sister, you're cruel. We love each other! Living in poverty? I don't want to hear any more. Women need rich men. Your man has no chance. He's a leech. You're strong. I can't live the way you do. I'm home. Welcome. - Hello, sister-in-law. - Let me stay a while. Of course. - The heat has affected you. - You think so? Just a minute. Don't come to my shop. I told you. I was expelled because of you. I have no one else to turn to. All right. I'll take care of you. I'm so glad. But I need money to live in town. Wait. Take this. I love you, master. Who's your mate today? Yonosuke, the kimono merchant? Or the master of the drugstore? Let me see. Sister... The kimono merchant is rich. Will such a wealthy merchant marry a poor girl like you? Yes. He promised. He gave me his comb. Father... Drunk during the day? You had money? No money. It was a treat. The kimono merchant got married today. They handed out free drinks to celebrate. - What kimono merchant? - Don't you know? Yonosuke. The young master of the kimono shop! Sister! Sister... Let go of me! I want to talk to Yonosuke! Young master... It's a lie! You will marry me! Please forgive me! - Young master. - Yonosuke! What are you doing?! Your bride is coming! His bride is here? You know her? No. Father, she must be crazy. You're cruel. I don't know her. She's a stranger. - Master! - Somebody... kick her out! How could you do this? Yonosuke, you'll regret this! Kill me! Kill me! You asked for it. Damn you! If I die! My spirit will haunt Yonosuke! You wanted to die? You're just a weak woman after all. Row. Where to? Anywhere. All the way down to the sea. That's stupid. It's a man's world everywhere. You can't escape from it. To survive... suck men's blood. That's the only way. I know. You of all people, don't have to preach to me. I'm thinking of revenge. I'm thinking of how to take revenge on Yonosuke. Do you have an idea? I can't think of anything. Please don't. Forgive me. How naive. Didn't your parents teach you how to make love? - They showed me some pictures. - Then you must know. A male organ. You're wet. One finger. Two. Now you're going to feel my manhood. Anybody there? Do you want it? You feel it. No. Help! Hey! Somebody help! I avenged you. The bride took a snake's head instead of a prick. She enjoyed it at first, then realized what it was and went crazy. They can't have sex again. - Why did you do that? - Who asked you to? - Sorry. - I'll avenge myself. It's none of your business. I want a portrait of your beautiful body as a reminder. Eisai is a good painter. I want him to sketch every part of my body. Even my pussy. I am beautiful. Will you spread your legs? Spread them. - Is this alright? - Not enough. Wider. How's this? Not enough. I want to see what she has between her legs. - Wider. How's this? - Not enough. Not enough. - How's this? - Not enough! You can even see her guts. Not enough. - She's wet. - Wet? All right. I'll take a look. How good is her pussy? Many worms are squirming inside! Master, once it's started I can't stop. Bring a barrel. - What for? - She needs it. - Why do you want a barrel now? - Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! It's sucking me! It's eating me! It's swallowing me! - You're really killing me! - That's not all yet. Let's go! This way I could even swallow a whale. Master... come. No barrels around here. I found a basin. What for? Love juice! It's like spring rain. She's spouting! Like a whale! What is she anyway?! Oshichi. Sister. What are you doing? My husband sent me here with a hairpin. - To a customer here? - Yes. Funny. Don't you know? This place is... Maybe the customer wants to buy it for his woman. Come home quickly. Don't! Take the hairpin and let me go! I bought it. I bought you too! Let go of me! No! I'm married! Your husband agreed to let me have you. I paid him ten gold pieces for this. You got a nice body! Welcome home. You smell of a man. You earned some gold pieces? So what? You sent your wife to a customer and drank sake at home. Fool. Are mosquitoes flying in heaven? Leeches too? What are you doing? You're drunk, aren't you? Yes. I'll be dead drunk today. You pandered your wife, didn't you? You sent her to a customer so he could sleep with her. You sold her, not the hair pin! Right? I don't know. Son-in-law, did you really pander my daughter? That's right! She's my wife after all! What are you doing? The money is mine! She's my daughter! Fool! If she has any value why did you give her to me? What are you doing? Stupid old man! You're overreacting! Damn old fart! I didn't do it. Murderer! I didn't do it! Look, your father stabbed himself. Alright, I killed him. Why not rape you? It makes no difference. Beast! I don't care. I can't survive in this world. Blame the land. Everything has gone wrong since I came here. Don't hold a grudge against me. It's this rotten earth. He stabbed me. He's raping your sister. I wasn't a crook like this when I came to live here. I wasn't so bad. Oshichi! - Oshichi! - Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Where are you going? I'm a murderer. I'll give myself up. - Oshichi! - Leave me alone! - He's the one to blame. - Even so, he was my husband. Note this: Your husband was to blame. He killed our father and ran away. That's very convincing. He's heavy. When he was alive he used to lie on top of me. He moved violently, but I never thought he was heavy. Idiot! This is no time to dwell on his sex technique. He must be sorry to have died. Enough. You! You should return the dead to Buddha quickly. Strange. It won't sink. Don't sink. It's cold in the water. Don't sink! Let me die. I'll die with him. Let me go! Let me go! Oshichi! Not long ago... ...a whore at Sakai Harbor slept with a thousand men. Then she went away. They say she was a benevolent goddess in disguise. I think differently. She killed her man. She wanted to atone for her sins. Self-sacrifice. I'll do the same thing. I'll sleep with a thousand men. I'll sacrifice myself. That'll be heaven's punishment. That'll console the spirit of my late husband. Maybe my spirit... ...will be saved too. Do you mean that? How stupid. You amaze me. I'll sleep with a thousand men. I'll atone for my sins. Call for the itinerant singer... ...once she sings for the dead peace she brings you in bed. Beautiful itinerant singer... You must be expensive. No, I come free of charge. She wants to sleep with a thousand men. It's her first night. Sounds nice! But she must have the clap or something. - Strip or I can't trust you. - That's right! Strip first. Are you offering yourself for nothing? Are you really free of charge? Yes. Wait! Don't swarm like ants! She's not the only woman around here! We're here too! Shut up! She's a real woman. You're just bitches. Saikei, count the men! I can't count them. Once I sing for the dead... ...peace I bring you in bed. Not yet. I want more. You've gained weight since you came here. That's right. Your skin has become oily. So moist, so smooth... How strange. You scarcely eat. You take one man after the other. Still your skin looks fresher. It's a miracle. My body seems different. It wasn't my intention, but men's semen nourishes me. It keeps me healthy. I started this to torture myself. But recently it's become a pleasure. I enjoy it. I secretly wish a nice man will come next. I'm ashamed. I can't believe it's real. You sent me a letter proposing a date. You're cruel, Yonosuke. I wanted to forget you. But my body is hungry for your touch. Hot. Hot. I can't make love to anybody else. You're burning like fire. I like it. Natsu, I'll never let you go. What's wrong? You're married. I don't want to feel miserable again. Natsu, I left her. It's true! You'll never feel miserable again. I'll marry you. You'll be my wife. - You really mean that? - Yes! But your father is strict. He won't approve of your marriage. I'm not afraid of that old man! Will you really tell him you want to marry me? Yes, I promise. - I'm so glad. - Natsu. Young master, I love you. The young master has given us a large gift. Natsu, are you really going to marry him? He's just a small fish. I'll catch a bigger one. How's Oshichi? I'm amazed. Men were in ecstasy on her belly. One of them went to heaven. She's a fool. She could make them pay and get rich. Nothing comes from nothing. I'm not on display. Go back to Oshichi. - Natsu! - Idiot! What do I get if I sleep with you? Hello. Excuse me. Hello. You crazy woman. You want to ruin my shop but you can't. How can I call a slut like you be my daughter-in-law? You swindled my son. So many kimonos. You got it stained. Pay for it! - That one too? - That's right. Give it back. Go ahead. Take it off. I will. I'll get them all back. Strip me. - I can't. - Strip me. My kimono, underwear... everything. It's all yours. - Let me go. - I won't. You said you'd get them all back. Sorry. Master... I lost. You come to a house where a girl lives alone. And you take her by force. You have to take responsibility. Father, you wanted me? Come in. Come in. Yonosuke, let me introduce this lady. She's Natsu. My second wife. Though she's young, she is your stepmother. Be obedient and filial to her. I understand... mother. The thousandth man. The last one. Now you can rest in peace, my dear husband. It's you! It's me. Please forgive me. I won't! I'm so glad. I'm glad you are alive. I can't die. The cold water brought me back to life. Harder, harder! Harder! I'll kill you. My dearest... My husband... You're dead again. You're really dead. You can't come back. 10.000 MEN I'm a fool. I told her about a geisha in Sakai. But I never thought she'd do the same thing. She's a live goddess who makes men see heaven on earth. Natsu... You've gained weight since you married the kimono merchant. Have I? Yes. Like Oshichi, you make love to many men. They gave you their nourishing semen. - You're healthy. - Really? Yes. You and Oshichi are beyond comprehension. Women... I don't understand them. You're an uncircumcised greenhorn. Uncircumcised? I know. You preach like a man who's seen the world. But you've never seen a pussy. So everything you think is vague and unreal. Saikei... Yes. You want to see my pussy, don't you? - Yes, very much. - Then use your green horn. Stop acting like a priest. Be a man. I will. Please make a man out of me! Be a man. You can use my pussy. For nothing. Yes. It's special. Watch carefully. Yes. What's wrong? - It has lips. - Of course. Put your green horn between them. Coward. How nice. Finished? Yes. Thank you. This is goodbye. - Natsu... - Yes? I'll change my name. Saikei means «Rooster of the West» A rooster can't fly. I've been crawling on the ground. I'll fly in the sky over the world. I'll see the world. The truth behind the screen. With my own eyes. That's good. I'll be a crane. «A Crane of the West». "Saikaku". Goodbye. Take care. Natsu! I love you! THE END
