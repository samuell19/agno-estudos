PLANET VEGA How many worlds are there? More than you and me could ever imagine. Wow! I used to stand here with my own father. I used to dream... That someday, you would travel to those distance worlds, but you never did. - No. Father, you´re always repeating that story. I´ve heard this story so many times. When was the last time you´ve heard the story? You always finish it with: ¨Perhaps it´s not my destiny.¨ You know your mother used to say: ¨We die of thirst just before an oasis appears on the horizon¨ So Abner, if you ever get lost, in the desert, what should you do? It´s impossible to get lost in the desert because the stars are looming every grain of sand under our feet. That´s right. And if you have a dream... follow it! Otherwise it stays in your heart rest of your days. It´s not too late. You can still get there. We´ll get there together. You and me. You and me. There´s a storm coming. Go on, go on! Breath in Breath, breath, breath! Breath with me Deep breath, deep breath Run, Abner! Bring him! Father! Don´t be afraid. 14 YEARS LATER PLANET VEGA EMPIRE QUARTERS Only those who have the courage to lead themselves, deserves to lead the others. Counselor believe you have owned this honor. She waits you. I remember the day you first came to us, young Abner. Timid little boy. Barely mightier than his own shadow, but what a mind! A mind so powerful, so full of promise.

You have given me a future. We create the future day by day. Together. A team was gonna symboled on this planet, and you will lead them. The children you find here will have given the rare opportunity of using their gifts for a higher purpose. There´s nothing more powerful than the untapped mind of a child.
