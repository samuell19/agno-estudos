(tinkling piano music) - I thought you were gonna get me out of this place. - I'm buying us a house. Brian you're gonna love it. It's on Spruce Street, right in the middle of town. Two bedrooms, one for you downstairs, one for me upstairs. Beautiful porch for you to watch the skiers coming down. - How long have I been hearing that Al? Let me tell you a secret. You don't buy houses you paint 'em. You and your stoned out, ski bum friends, you're totally out of touch with reality. How are you gonna get the money to buy a house? (upbeat drumming music) ♫ Really love the rain ♫ Against the window ♫ Bringing back sweeter memories ♫ I feel a pain when I remember ♫ How sweet it used to be ♫ When we were together ♫ Everything was so grand ♫ Now that we're talking ♫ If there's one shot, I got to show, I got to say ♫ I really love the rain ♫ Against the window ♫ But you're never here with me ♫ I feel a pain when I remember ♫ What a thrill it used to be ♫ Remember those feelings. - Sunshine. - Al Dean. Got somethin' for me? For fingered lift, alright. Here you go. - If you like this stuff, you're not gonna believe what I got comin' in. My friend Lonnie, I told you about Lonnie right? - His father's an ambassador right? - Diplomatic immunity, comes through customs unchecked. He's gonna score me, get this, Nepalese temple balls. - Shut up. - I am serious man. It's got the monastery's insignia right there on it so you know it's the real thing. - Far out. - These monks, picture this, they live at 18,000 feet right there in the shadows of Mount Everest. What they do is they take the shake in marijuana plants and they chew on it while they meditate. They're up there, they're invoking the spirits, they're working that keef into a gummy ball. They they take the gummy ball, mix it with opium and they get these temple balls. - Cool. - Then they take them out and trade them with other monasteries for chickens, pigs, indoor plumbing, I dunno, what ever else they need. - Can you eat 'em? - You're mowing my lawn. - What happens when you eat 'em? - Temple balls! - I like eatin' 'em. - This stuff is the nectar of the gods. Guaranteed to improve your karma. One hit of this stuff and boom, you're blessed. And I need all the help I can get with that shit. - Howdy people, how are you doing today? (cheering) Everybody having a good time? (cheering) Let's get to the pig chase. You know the rules. First person to catch the little piggy can either take home $50 or the porker. Contestants, are you ready? Catch that pig! (upbeat banjo music) (crowd cheering) We have our winner. (crowd cheering loudly) What's your name darlin'? - Errol McNamara. - Errol. - [Crowd Chanting] Errol, Errol, Errol, Errol, Errol. - What's it gonna be, the pig or $50? - [Crowd Chanting] Pig, pig, pig, pig, pig, pig. (upbeat blues music) ♫ Further on down the road baby ♫ You'll accompany me ♫ Oh darlin' ♫ Further on down the road baby ♫ You'll accompany me ♫ Oh - Did I see you waitressing at the Pick Beth? - Yeah I started working there. - Thought you were moving to San Fran? - No, I put that on hold. - You're not waiting over Tom? - Girl he was out of his mind when Woody died. (upbeat blues music) - I wonder how he's doing now? - There is no question that Ajax has all the ingredients to make us the destination resort in North America. I know it's hard to get to, but it's part of our charm. The airport? We've gathered all the signatures, filed the petition, it's on the ballot. The voters are gonna approve it in November. It's a done deal. (video game beeping) This is definitely our year. We'll be flying jets in here before you know it. Say hi to Joan for me and you will be hearing from me in the middle of next week. Bing fucking go. Phil? Phil? How are we doin' on the signatures? - [Phil] About a hundred shy. - What are we doing in here? - [Phil] Reloading? - Very good. Load, reload, sell, resell. Now put the gun down and get out on the street and get us on the ballot so we can make some real money. (phone ringing) Kurt Hinney, Summit Development. Hello? Oh Victor. I closed on Thursday. Oh it's great. Two acres. Pristine mesa land. And the views are amazing. Sure. It's zone commercial and residential. You know it. Well I'm glad it worked out for you Vick. Let's keep in touch. (harmonica music) (crowd chattering) - But it works. - Down through Upper Chicken Gobbler, down through Lower Gobbler and then drop the big. - It's about time. - You dropped all these 714's, I was luded out of my head. Sunshine ragin', ride that wave, ride that wave. I was laughing so hard, I almost wet my panties man. - [Man] So what happened to you yesterday? I was waiting around for half an hour down at the retreat. - Hey big daddy, hey buddy come here, I got something for you. (blender whirring) - Hey Beth. - Hey Al Dean. - How're you doing sug? - Doing good, I gotta go to work though. - Where are you going? - I gotta go to work. - You just got here. - I know. Come by and see me at the Pick. - I'll come by and see ya. - Okay. - [Radio] You know it's a winner. Peter Polk earned a lifetime supply of Werner Wiener Dogs in game six of last year's Beaver Pelt Championship Series. Let's go to my now historic call. - Polk now steps up to the plate against the oh so intimidated Charlie Burke. Polk already with three round triples on the evening, what could he possibly do for an encore? Burke sets, he delivers, Polk though with a monster strike. It's deep, it could be, you can call that ball a Hindu 'cause it is Gandhi. Grizzlies, gonna repeat. - Not if the Wool Socks can help it. - Easy. - Al Dean. Errol, you shifty little Aussie. - Ah Easy. What the hell happened to you? - Long story. It's all good though. Rito, what happened to you man? - Wailed on my ankle in a mushroom grove. - [Tom] Ouch. - Tell me about it. - Hey Tommy, you wanna beer man? - Yeah man. Whoa, what's up with the pig? - Errol won Porky yesterday at the pig chase. Thinks we're gonna keep him for the summer. - Bloody yes we are. I'm gonna build him a pen, fatten him up for the summer, and have a roast in the fall. - I really don't see why we want a pig. - Sacrifice him to Pan and Bacchus. - Sacrifice him to Ullr. - [All] Praise Ullr. - There is no way in hell that I am living with a pig for the summer. - [Errol] After Woody's funeral, we all thought you were gone for good. - Just had to split Mac. I didn't know where I was goin', but. - Hey, no need to explain. Truth be known I was bloody bent. You could've at least dropped me a line. Anyway, you picked a good season to leave. There's been bugger all snow until the last couple of weeks. So you think you're gonna stick around? - Really just came back to pack up my stuff and put it in storage. - Come on mate, you should stay for the summer. Listen, you can have your old room back if you want it. Why don't you think about it. Listen I gotta hit the sack. I'm tending bar at the Pick this summer. - Alright man. - Hey Sully, it's good to have you back mate. (pig snorting) (distant whistling) - He's so cute. What are you gonna name him? - How about Floyd man? - You can't name the pig Floyd. The Poxy sisters named their pig Floyd. - Hey did you guys know that Pigs have made important contributions to American literature? Pigs love to drink, that's probably the reason I like 'em. In fact pigs are the only animals that would drink enough to be classified as an alcoholic. - Tom, whatcha doing this weekend? - Nothing much. You wanna do something? - Well I was thinking of going climbing. - Where? - How about the Van Winkle Wall? - What are you trying to make me look bad? I'm not in climbing shape. - Sure you are. Come on, it'll be fun. - Yeah sure. - But of course uh, Orwell might be appropriate in honor of George and his pigs from Animal Farm. Remember Napoleon had that great line. "All animals are created equal, "some are more equal than others." I love that one. How about you Beth, any ideas for a name? - Hmm. How about Hud? Hud won a pig. - How about Scrapple? - Scrapple? What the hell is scrapple? - Exactly. - Oh I've had scrapple before. My mom used to give it to us as kids, absolutely foul. You think you're biting into sausage, and it is not. - But what's in it? - Nobody really knows what's in scrapple man? - Come on people. You Yanks invented the crap. I had scrapple when I was hitching through Pennsylvania. It's like a cornmeal mash and the meat and broth of the pork. Season it with onions, a little salt and pepper, shape it into a loaf, spice it up, and fry it. It's as gross as head cheese. - Cool. - Sit Scrapple, sit. Good piggy. (cheerful country music) ♫ I ain't high on cocaine, I don't need the pain ♫ It's bad for your brain and that's true. ♫ I ain't droppin' no names, I aint' playin' no games ♫ I'm just one step ahead of the blues ♫ One step ahead of the blues ♫ From Memphis to Reno, from New York to Tokyo ♫ I tried to come through for you ♫ I won't do you in, I ain't no fair weather friend ♫ I'm just one step ahead of the blues ♫ One step ahead of the blues. - Man I'm either having a long term loss of my short term memory, or short term loss of my long term memory. Trouble is, I can't remember man. - Mercury's in retrograde. - So that's my problem? - It's all of our problems. Nobody's safe. - Painter Pedro. - Hey what's the scene Al Dean. - Your radio show the other day was solid man. - Turn it up or turn it off. - You remember Easy? - Easy, how's it going bro? - Good man. - Hey I'm trying to convince him to stick around for the summer. We're looking for somebody right? - Hey we're always looking for someone. Never been busier. Drop on by the job site Monday, we'll fix ya up. - Great. - Hey is that Errol's pig? - Yeah, Scrapple. - Alright, cute little booger. - Have a good one Pedro. ♫ Even with the curves, son it could be worse ♫ I've been one step ahead of the blues ♫ One step ahead of the blues ♫ One step ahead of the blues ♫ One step ahead of the blues (police radio chatter) (police siren blaring) - Another package? You must feel awful loved son. Let's say we take a peak, see what's in there? - You can't do that. - I can do anything I want to. 14 packages in the last three months and no return address. Now let's see what's in the package. - I know I got rights. - Look, we can open it now, or I can take you and your hippy friend down to the station and we'll take a look at it there. - It's got nothing to do with him. He's just giving me a ride. - It's in his vehicle. What's it gonna be? - You open it. (glass clinking) You broke it! It's for my brother. He's in a VA hospital. Is that legal? Why don't you stop hassling me man. - I've been working on my own stuff. Got a few solo gigs planned. - Right on, where? - The Pick mostly. - Far out. - Not for a couple weeks though. You sticking around? - I wasn't planning on it. But I could sure use to make some bread yanno? - Where would you go if you left? - I dunno, back east probably. I'm not sure really. I mean I could always go to to work for the family. The problem is, is I can't stand the family. - I'd like you to stay. I mean, if that makes any difference. - I'll see what happens with Pedro. (upbeat music) - Yeah, yeah so my friends, they spend the day hanging out, kicking this bag around. I dunno, it's about the size of a golf ball. Yeah full of beads. Well no, there is no point. Nobody wins or loses or anything, it's communism. Yeah. Well I guess the point is to keep this thing in the air, all day long. Really. Well I'm thinkin' we can make these things for a nickel a piece in Honduras or something. Yeah, sell 'em for a buck. Oh at least. Well think about it. Yeah I gotta go. Love you too Dad, bye. - [Al] How's it going? - Not much. - How's the land pimpin' racket? Sell any dirt today. - Actually somebody came in yesterday asking about your place. They just want the lot though, they're gonna bulldoze that eye sore. - Good one. - Yeah, so, how are things with your brother? - I dunno. Pretty good I guess. They moved him out to a place in Prescott so at least he's closer but, it'd be a lot better if he were here. - How's my house on Spruce doing? - Well it might not be yours if you don't make an offer soon. A couple came in just this morning ready to start the paperwork. - What are they offering? - 35. I don't think they're gonna take it, they want 50. But you need $7,500 to make a bid yourself. - Kurt doesn't know I'm interested, does he? - Let's do this ourselves. Can you get the dough? - Close. I'm gonna get it though. - That a way Al, have a little vision. - It's not the vision part of this equation I'm having a problem with, it's the reality that's trippin' me up. - Yeah, but you know the thin line between vision and reality, that's belief. - You are scaring me man. You're not buying into Kurt's pseudo sales is life philosophy, are ya? Besides, $7500 is not a thin line. $7500 is a big old fat line. (sniffing) - Phil, don't you have some business to take care of on the street? - Yeah, on my way. Hey Kurt do you know Al Dean? - Of course I do, he painted my house last summer. - Right. - Hey Al, can I speak to you a moment? You got a minute? - Yeah sure. So what's going on? - You know Toots right? - Sure I know Toots. He split town didn't he? - Yes he did. - And? - And I'm lookin' for someone to replace him. You interested? - Selling whiff? - I've seen you operate Al, you're strictly small time. You could make a lot of money working for me. - Not my thing. - Maybe you need to decide what your thing is Al. Risk reward ratio. The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward. Sure you can keep selling $20 lids, but where's it gonna get ya? - Look Kurt, I'm doing pretty good on my own. Is this what you brought me in here for? - You'd be stupid not to think about it. (blues guitar music) - You want some? It's that killer weed Al gave you. (pig snorting) - Sexual attraction last four years tops. How are you gonna spend your whole life with someone you're not even attracted to. - What have you been reading Cosmo again Al? - There's that Mars and Sag in the fifth house. A lover with a temper. - You have any idea what she's talking about? - Not a clue. - Um two more beers. - [Errol] Okay, you got it. - Hey Tom, how're ya doin'? - Hey Easy. - Al Dean. You got any pot man? - Whoa, Tom, try to be cool. - Nah I wanna get ripped. Can you score me some grass? - You need to shut your trap Tommy. - No, you remember that bag of weed you sold me back in November? - What is your problem man? - That was really killer weed man. - Well I'm glad. - You're glad!? - You guys, come on, come on, come on. - You're glad!? He's glad. Did you hear that? He's glad. - Take my table. - Yeah. - What was that all about? - I gave him that bag. (slow banjo music) (cheerful guitar music) (loud slurping) (pig snorting) - Fourth of July today Scraps. Temple balls are finally comin' in. Gonna put me over the top. What do you think of that? (mellow guitar music) - You were really messed up the other night. - I bricked. - Yes you did. - Hey thanks for taking care of me. - Well you needed taking care of. - I know. So you excited about tonight? - I dunno. - Why not? You're gonna be great. What? - Well I'm just a little nervous. - Don't be. - Are you gonna be there? - Of course. Why don't you play me something right now. - No, uh uh, no. - Come on Beth, come on. - No. - Come on. (laughing) - Okay, okay. Okay, um. What do you wanna hear? - [Tom] I dunno. What's your favorite song you've written in the last six months? (mellow guitar music) ♫ Rain comes down ♫ It's never gonna stop no, no ♫ I hear the ticking of the pine ♫ Well I'm moving down ♫ This dusty road ♫ The cold winds they are blowing through my hair ♫ And I'm miles from my home ♫ I know this highway, I'm sure I know it well - So after mom died, I said to myself, Errol life is just way to short to end up at 60 with a gold watch and a pension. Headed out looking for nirvana. - This might not be it, but the backyard's not to bad eh? Can I get you something? - Scotch on the rocks and do me well. ♫ But tonight I'm a soul like a burning fire - Say uh, you wouldn't happen to know a Kurt Hinney would ya? - Well the thing about Ajax is, it's a nice quiet town. We all live here together alone minding our own business. But uh, I think you might find him back in the bathroom. - Much obliged. - Thank you. (giggling and sniffing) - See you back at the bar. - Okie dokie. - Well, excuse me. Kurt Hinney? - Yeah, and you're? - Cy Sloan from Aspen. - Oh my old stomping ground. - Yes, that's what I understand. Glen Fisher told me to look you up. Said you were the king of Ajax. Interested in some real estate. - Oh really, what are you interested in? - Mesa land. - Who in the hell are you? - I told you, Glen wanted me to see you. I manage his club. - Oh he did, did he? I'm not really sure what you want right now, but I'm kinda busy. If you wanna talk business, you can come by my office. Summit Development. - [Radio] Sparky Styles on in relief for the Grizzlies. His wife, Sharon, is a pretty fine golfer. - [Tom] Hey man I owe you an apology. I was way out of line at the Pick the other night. - No need to apologize. I know you're going through some heavy shit. What I wanna know is if you and Beth went to the horizontal disco. - I'm not trying to get on Beth. - She is flush man. - There's no doubt about that. - And she's definitely into you. - I don't think so man, we're buds. Hey, Socks win last night? - Yeah they won in the 10th. Marsh went three for four with two dingers. - On a tear man. Just wait 'til the wind starts blowing out of Tubs Field. - Socks are just like you whiskey boy, can't keep it up. - Guys wanna break for lunch? - [Al] No you go ahead, we'll catch you later. - Alright, catch ya later. - Philly Brandel's been comin' by the house lookin' for ya. What you got going? - Trying to score a place. - You don't have any money. - I got a lot of irons in the fire. - Selling bags? - Look mister I was way out of line, I don't wanna talk about it. - I wanna talk about it. - Well I don't like hearing about it from you and you don't like hearing about it from me, so let's just drop it right. - What do you think you're gonna do, nickel and dime your way into a house? - I'm not just gonna buy the blueprint for life Tom. I'm trying to get some money together so I can do my own thing. - Yeah, pushing drugs. - Selling lids of grass does not make me a pusher. I get a bag and it's gone in two days. - Listen to yourself. What does it make you then? - It's not like I'm mixing up sopa's in our bathtub or anything. I mean, it's grass, it's harmless. - Harmless? What if you get busted? Who's gonna take care of your brother? - Who's taking care of him now? Why don't you stop laying your head trips on me alright Sully? - So what are you in the market for? - I was thinkin' five ki's. - You can move that much? - Oh yeah, it's not a problem. If Aspen runs dry, I got contacts in the Butte, Telluride, all over the place. You can get me the five? - That's a lot of shit amigo. These things take time. Half the money up front, the other half upon delivery, no exceptions. - I can work with that. (tape voices rewinding swiftly) - [Kurt] You can move that much? Half the money up front, the other half upon delivery, no exceptions. - Captain Colorado. - Research Lewis, research. (upbeat marching band music) - Eight Ball. What you got for me? - These are from Lonnie. There's more where this came from. - About time. I paid that guy six months ago for these. - Hey they're well worth the wait. - Are you sure? I mean there's no symbol from the monastery on them. - [Lonnie] Hey it's the real shit daddy. - Alright. Thanks Eight Ball. (bluegrass music) - Summit Mountain Studios. Okay get this, we're talking a major recording studio adjacent to an airport, atop pristine mesa land. James Taylor, Taj Mahal, I know 'em, they wanna do it. There is no question that Ajax has all the ingredients to make us the destination resort in North America. Juerta, Klauss. - Kurt. Are you okay? - Yeah I'm cool. - So who's the customer? - He's an old friend from Aspen. He owns the Purple Rose. Eagles, Buffet, Dirt Band, they all play there. - God you're such a star fucker. So why does he want so much all of the sudden? - He's afraid we're done, I told him about the airport. Let's do this. - Well I've got quite a bit sitting in Mexico. We could fly it in below radar at night into Dallas, right Juerta? Run it right up here. Who's gonna make the pickup? - I'll take care of it. I've never let you down Klauss. - You feel good about this? - Five ki's? I feel fucking great about this Klauss, great. - We might be able to make this work. I'm gonna need some time though to set it up. - Perfect. - So? - What? - You got something for me? - Oh. - Yeah. This little strip has been good to us. - This airport's gonna keep being good to me. Could be good for you too Klauss. I need some capitol to close on some big deals. Why don't you come in with me? - Real estate? Juerta lets go. - [Radio] A loss today by the Grizzly Bears would put them 14 games back of the league leading Wool Socks halfway through the season. - Did you here what Martin William said last night? Someone asked him if he thought that the Grizzlie's could catch the Wool Socks. You know what he said? He said, there ain't no sense worrying about things you can't control. 'Cause if you can't control 'em, there ain't no sense worrying about 'em. Is that beautiful or what? You're probably a Socks fan huh Scraps? Feelin' pretty confident. Well let me tell you somethin', Socks don't have pitching. Pitching wins championships. This has got the best farm league in the country. Lou Lincoln was a Grizz. Bet you didn't know that. - Phil, life is not a popularity contest, so get over it because a positive mental attitude. - Equals other people's money. And that money in your pocket is mine and I just gotta find a way to get it. - There you go Phil. I'm glad you appreciate those nuggets I throw your way. Any walk-in traffic today? - None. - Anything else? - Well yeah, actually I was wondering if you had any activity on the Mahoney house over on Spruce? - There's a $40,000 offer on the table. I think Mahoney's gonna bite. Why? - Well Al Dean's been eyeing it and you know his brother got all messed up in Vietnam and is in a VA hospital. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're breaking my heart. What's the point? - Look I'm trying to help him out. He's having a tough time getting a loan and I thought, you know, maybe we could come up with some creative financing or something. - Yeah I think I might be able to help him out. Tell him to come out to my house this weekend, I've got some great financial sources. - Oh that would mean a lot. Thanks Kurt. - That's our business Phil, making dreams come true. - Right. - It ain't natural, that's all I'm saying. (old time piano music) Yes. - [Errol] Al Dean, you couldn't hit the broadside of a barn. - And look at monkeys. They're the closest species to humans right? Let me tell you somethin', monkeys are not monotonous. You see, each male monkey wants to bang whatever he can. And the female monkeys only wanna bang the strongest male monkey because they want their babies to be strong. The weak, nerdy, lame monkeys, they never get laid. But the alpha monkey gets to nail whoever he wants because all the babe monkeys want his super sperm. - [Errol] Pitch the ball already. Yeah like that Al Dean, except over the plate. - A little Charles Darwin there, survival of the fittest. - And that is why the monkeys fight so hard to be the alpha monkey, because only the alpha monkey gets any booty. - [Errol] You go Al Dean, stick it to 'em. - Wait, what do the other monkeys do? - They indulge themselves. - Shut up. - Why do you think they call it spankin' the monkey? - Monkey love my ass. Listen, I hate to break it to you, you wanker, but we're mammals that adapted to life on land. - So what's your point Errol? - My point is that we're more like dolphins than monkeys. - Dolphins? - Dolphins. Dolphins are mammals. Am I right? They breathe in air, drink their mothers milk. - They do? - Yeah. Uh look at our skin, we have skin not fur. Am I right? - Yeah he's right. - People are born with webbed appendages all the time. Next time you're looking in a mirror look at the similarity between your ugly schnozz and a dolphin's blowhole. What else? Oh saline content in the womb is exactly that of the ocean. - Errol you're changing the subject. - Hang on a second. I'm not finished yet. But perhaps most important, and most relevant to this conversation, dolphins are monogamous, is the word, not monotonous dickwad, and they're known to mate for life. So you go ahead and pork like King Kong if you want, I'm gonna go swim with my little friend Flipper. (laughing) - Dolphins are mammals? Dolphins are mammals? - Errol, I mean wolves and loons are monogamous. But dolphins? - Listen mate, if there is one thing I learned on walkabout it's that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. - Amen brother. - Oh uh, Kurt wants to talk to you. - Why? - Well I set up a meeting about the house on Spruce. - Ah man. I thought we agreed not to go through Kurt? - Come on look alive, you guys could've had that. - Look Al, the clock's ticking. The Mahoneys want out and they're considering a $40,000 bid. - You know how I feel about Kurt man. - Yeah, but he thinks he can help you. - Yeah I bet he does. - Look just go by his house. Sorry. - I gotta to his house now? - Yeah just to, you're being obtuse about this. Obtuse, ridic, look do you want the house or not? Alright go, don't go, it's up to, just whatever. - Three outs. (serene music) - I had a lot of fun today. - Yeah so did I. I should probably go, huh? - Why don't you stay? (upbeat bluegrass music) ♫ Love ya mama now you know I can ♫ Be the one to be your man ♫ Love ya mama now you know I'd do ♫ Anything in the world for you ♫ To have lovin' in my baby's eyes ♫ To see the lovin' in my baby's eyes ♫ To see the loving in my baby's eyes ♫ Lovin' in my baby's eyes ♫ Love ya mama now you know I can ♫ Love ya better than another man can ♫ Love ya mama now you know I'd do ♫ Anything in the world for you ♫ To have lovin' in my baby's eyes ♫ To see lovin' in my baby's eyes ♫ To have loving in my baby's eyes ♫ Lovin' in my baby's eyes ♫ To have magic in my baby's eyes ♫ To have lovin' in my baby's eyes ♫ To see the lovin' in my baby's eyes - Tom? Tom? - Woody? - What are you thinkin' about? - You. - Oh, bad timing. - [Radio] So the bases are stacked here in the seventh, the game tied four a piece, only one out. If the Socks cannot hold onto this they will leave the door open for the Grizzly Bears to take a four game lead with only two weeks left in the season. Here's the payoff pitch to Chris Samuels. - Hey Mac, two more. - [Errol] Two? Gotcha. - Grizzlies have won six straight against the Socks. They are choking like a bunch of rookie pole smokers. - You're killin' me. - Fraum couldn't catch 'em now. - I mean you know they're gonna face each other in the Beaver Pelt Series again. - And the Socks are going down. (pig snorting) (groovy music) (loud crunching) (helicopter blades whirring) (odd tinkling music) (bells ringing) (engine revving) - [Al] Oh no. - [Tom] Look at this place. - [Al] Please no. Oh my god. (laughing) Oh god. Oh man. (screaming) - [Sunshine] What's going on with Tom? - I dunno. We got together about two weeks ago and we haven't talked since. - Typical. I dunno I mean, I think he's bringing you down. You outta dump him. I mean I love Easy, I do. But he's obviously got some serious shit to work through. - I say you stick it out. His Sun, Venus, and Mercury are all in the seventh house so relationships are in the forefront for him. He's got his Mars and his moon in the 12th house, so he doesn't know what he wants. He just needs some time, sister. - I'm afraid he's going a number on you. I say fuck him. He'll come crawling back. Check this one out babe. - [Beth] Al Dean will love that. - He's a Leo, those are his colors. - Phil's not here. - [Al] I'm not here to see Phil. - Is that so? - [Al] What's going on with the Spruce house? - The Mahoneys are ready to move. - [Al] Well then so am I. - Let's talk business. - [Al] What do I gotta do? - One pick up, one drop off. (police radio chatter) (knocking on door) - [Sheriff] Hey, anybody home? Stinkin' hippies. (groovy music) (odd laughter) - [Errol] Hey Beth, you wanna see if that sap around the corner's hungry? - Hi. - So you wanna order? - Yeah lemme look. So what've you been doin'? - Not much. You? - Been on a bad head trip. - Well it's just been a joyride for me Tom. - Look, I've been an asshole. - You said it. - Beth I'm sorry. - Don't be. - Look I was wondering. Wanna go to the hot springs this weekend? - I can't, I got a gig Saturday. - How about Friday? Come on, when was the last time you got out of the valley? - Well I was gonna go climbing. - With who? - Paul. What I can't go climbing? I'm supposed to sit around and wait while you blow me off? - I haven't been. No that's fine, obviously. So how about after? - Um I dunno I think, I think Paul might wanna nail me. I'm kidding. Look, let me think about it okay? So you wanna order? - I already ate. - Scrapple. Having consumed 22 Nepalese temple balls, I now declare you the Dalai pig Lama. - Resurrected after a most fitful slumber. - The dharma pig has risen. - Hey maybe we should keep him through the winter. - Are you kidding me? Deano's been ready to kill porky here since Scraps ate his cash and his stash. This little piggy's going to market. Aren't you buddy? Living on borrowed time. - Yeah but do we have to eat her? I mean I feel more comfortable not being on a first name basis with my dinner. - Oh come on Sully, we eat meat all the time. Now you're just seeing where it comes from. - I know that, I'd just rather not meet the meat I eat. - Hey Sully. Maybe you should take him to the spirit world? - The canyons? - I got some shrooms. The way I see it, Scraps was probably some wise sage in his last life, so he's just being tested in this one. He's in a transition period is all. - Oh no. - What? - Fucked up. - What? - I'm supposed to go to the hot springs with Beth today. - Oh she is gonna be dark on you. You wanna turn back? - I can't believe that. By the time we get back. Hey pull over, I'll call her. (phone ringing) God you're such a dick. (upbeat rock music) - You do know you're gonna die soon, don't you? (giggling) Of course you don't, you're a pig. (laughing) You dumb pig. (snorting) I mean, seems to me you're aware of what is going on Scrapple. But you're not really aware that you're gonna die because I mean, let's face it if you were aware of life then you would be aware of death. Right? Am I right? Are you listening to me? Are you listening to me? I don't think you are, I think you're more interested in food right now. (groovy music) - Tom I gotta tell it to you straight. You are screwing everything up. Do you love Beth? Then tell her. You wanna free yourself, then set me free. (water rushing) - Get out. (giggling) How are you doing? - Good. Here I made a sandwich for you. - Thank I'm starving. - You okay? - Wow. - Man you look as ripped as I feel. How's your buzz? - Good. Got a little heavy there for awhile but. I mean I haven't tripped since. - Woody? - I loved her man. - I know. - You know after all that weight though, I had this one moment of absolute clarity. I had it all figured out. - I love it when that happens. So tell me, what is it all about? ♫ I don't wanna think about tomorrow right now ♫ No I don't ♫ And you don't wanna talk about yesterday yeah, yeah ♫ Just look me in the eyes and tell me that you love me ♫ Right now ♫ Give me some of that sweet, tender loving today ♫ I want you to give me ♫ Some of that sweet tender loving today ♫ Yeah, yeah ♫ Give me some of that sweet tender, loving today (audience cheering and applauding) (upbeat bluegrass music) - Missed you at the hot springs. - Beth I'm so sorry. - Yeah just don't apologize. You always fucking apologize. - Look it was completely spontaneous. Errol and I just. - I don't wanna hear about it. - I tried to call. - I'm sure you did. You know maybe we should just keep going the way we're going. You know, I'm really writing some great songs, this would really work out. Look I've thought a lot about this. Woody would want you and me to be together. I mean she would love it. Don't you believe that? - Yeah that's. I mean you make it sound like it's easy. - No, not easy Tom, I know it's not easy. - You don't understand. - Then make me understand. Tell me what's going on with you. 'Cause if you can't, don't come back. This shit is really getting old. - Beth. - Uh Cy Sloan please. Uh no that's okay. Tell him that Kurt Hinney from Summit Development in Ajax called and I'll be forwarding the mesa land contracts no later than Monday morning. (low key music) - Hey Strike's how's Hawaii? - Lots of aloha, wouldn't miss this gig though. - Al Dean, you been checking out the playoffs. - Game seven tomorrow. What a season huh? Hey Mac, can I borrow your truck tomorrow? - I'm sorry mate, it's in the shop getting a service. - Hey did you hear dred Fred's running for mayor? - Only in Ajax. - Hey Tom, you wanna kick? - Nah man. - Easy, can I borrow your bike tomorrow? - Yeah sure. - [Al] Thanks man. What's up with Easy? - I don't think he's all that excited about us roasting Scraps. - [Al] This roast is gonna be unbelievable, whole town's gonna be there. How many barrels you get? - [Errol] We got five already and we still gotta get one more. Oh and the tap. Six barrels, can you pick that up Al? - I'm kinda busy tomorrow. - Come on man I dug the bloody pit, least you can do is pick up one keg. - [Al] On one condition. - What's that? - [Al] I get to kill that pig. - [Errol] Deal. - [Al] Sorry. - Sorry buddy. Come on Scraps I got a plan. Come on. Trust me. - [Radio] After three innings of play here at Tubs Field there is still no score between the Grizzly Bears and the Wool Socks. The winner of this game takes the coveted Beaver Pelt Crown. - It's a go. Tell Denver we're on. Good. - And they're merging with who? Are you sure? Hang on. Oh yeah count me in for 1,000 shares. Great. Yeah just between you and me. What's that? Oh it snowed in the mountains last night. Oh it's gonna be a great winter, you should come out. Yeah we'll set it up. Okay see ya. - Bad man, hittin' home runs for capitalism. - How's it going Al? - It's going, running around, getting ready for this roast. Like I got time for this. You gonna be there? - Oh yeah wouldn't miss it. - [Radio] It's deep, it's way back, home run. - Oh man, damn. Is uh, is Kurt in? - Uh no he left for the day. But he did leave that for you. So I hear you're making a bid on the house. - We'll see. - Oh that's great. - Did he say where he was going? - Uh uh. - I gotta skip. - Okay, later man. Hey Dad, can you keep a secret? - [Radio] As you know fans, everybody loves a winner. Why should it be any different when you do your weekend grocery shopping? So if you wanna reach for a winner, go for Werner Wiener Dogs. Because if it's a Werner, you know it's a winner. ♫ It's a Werner, it's a wiener, it's a Werner Wiener Dog ♫ It's a Werner it's wiener, it's a Werner Wiener Dog - Alright Deano, good man. - [Al] Hey Mac. - How're you doing? Want a hand? - [Al] Thanks. - Let's get this puppy out of here, get it on some ice. One, two, three. Ready to do the deed? - [Al] Let's do it. - Ah friends, Ajaxians, pig lovers all. We have gathered here today to pay homage not only to a pig, but a sage. Not only to a hog, but a muse. Not only to a porker, but a friend. Not only to a pause sign, mind traveler, but a transcendent spirit. Tonight Scrapple we will feast on you, all the while remembering what you have brought to our lives. Laughter, surprise, and family. Tonight we will eat from your ample loins to provide nourishment for our hungry hearts, our eager minds, and our empty bellies. We pray to you Ullr. - [All] Ullr. - To provide bountiful manner from the heavens above for our coming winter season. Gentlemen. - You ready? - Lock and load. I can't do this. (gun shot ringing) - [Radio] There's a drive toward left. It's deep, it could be. Yes, he watches it go into the screen. The Grizzly Bears take the lead three to two. And the team goes flying out of the dugout. Suddenly this whole game has turned around. - Remember what I said. Nobody and I mean nobody is to make any kind of move until we've got verification of cash. Cash transaction. Have I made myself perfectly clear? Excellent. Sheriff looks like we're good to go here. Take my man Lewis and get yourself a position. Alright. Who the hell's got my lighter. (blow dryer running) - How's it going Juerta? (sighing) How's it going Juerta? How's it going Juerta? How's it going Juerta? Buenos dios Juerta. Buenos dios Juerta. Buenos dios Juerta. The bike! Have you seen Easy? (upbeat country music) - It's a no go, that's right, yes. Tell Juerta I'll call tomorrow okay? Great. - Have you see Tom? - No. What's going on? - He's gone. - He's gone? - I can't find him anywhere. I've been looking all over town, his bike's gone. I think he just split man. - Thought he might. - Listen I gotta go. - Al Dean, is everything okay? - [Al] No, everything is not okay. Kurt! Kurt! Kurt! Kurt! Kurt! (funky music) - Whoa, what? Klauss? What the hell are you doing here. Check the orders out. Get up Kurt, you look like shit. - I was, I was a little edgy. So what are you doing here? - Little change of plans. I decided to come check things out first myself here. - Why? I got somebody going to the airstrip. - There's no one going to the airstrip. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about the pigs. - Pigs? - Yeah, the place is swarmed with pigs, feds. CDI, FBI, DEA, even the Sheriff. They're having a party up there. - Everything's cool. - It must be my paranoia. Put out your cigarette. - What? - Your cigarette, put it out, it's not good for you. I am sorry you're so unhappy Kurt. (gun shot blasting) (crowd chattering) - [Radio] It's not over and it won't be over until the final round is recorded here at Tubs Field. Could it get any better than this? A game, a season, an entire athletic heritage for two cities. There's a chance to win the game at the bottom of the ninth. The wind up, the hook delivers, Lastrisky pops it way up. High nettles is under an involved territory and the Grizzly Bears win. The Denver Grizzly Bears have just beaten the Colorado Springs Wool Socks five to four to claim the Beaver Pelt crown. For the Grizzlies the taste of victory has to be particularly sweet for all the difficulty this club faced on the season. (upbeat rock music) - Errol. - How're you doing Sunshine? - [Laura] What's happening Errol? - Not too much. I'm looking for Sully. Have you seen him? - No. - What about Al? - [Laura] Not tonight. - Oh well, you snooze you lose.
