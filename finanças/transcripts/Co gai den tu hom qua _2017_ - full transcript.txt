The baskets full of flamboyant flowers Where are you taking my summer? The flamboyant flowers In your hand are my 18th When no one knew my silent first love... I never thought that one day I would cry because of a girl. When I was small, things were very different, or in other words, I was way cooler than I am now. That's why I sometimes dream of those glory days with jealousy and desire. I still remember exactly the day my family moved to our new place. I was only seven or eight years old then. I joyfully ran around. My little devil of a sister wasn't born then which made the place so huge and deserted. I was hanging out by myself when I saw a girl. She was playing with a sand dune in the neighbor's yard. Back then, if I liked a girl, I just made friends with them in a blink of an eye. Hey, what's your name? Tieu Li. Does Tieu Li mean to pee in a glass? You're talking nonsense. What are you playing? Can I join? You scared me. Let go of my hand, please. Only if you say that you're not mad at me anymore. Okay. I'm not mad at you anymore. What's your name? Thu. It sounds like a girl's name. No, it doesn't! Hey, you've lost a tooth. You must have eaten a lot of candies. No, I haven't. Next time, I will help you eat the candies. - Sure. - See, girls are easy to manipulate. Back then, I was always busy thinking about how I could bully Tieu Li besides taking her food. And I came to a conclusion. Girls are so dumb. Thu, wake up. It's time for school. But that was my childish conclusion. Now I have another one, and it's less encouraging. "Girls get smarter and smarter while guys get more and more stupid." And this is the destined day that my misery begins. Gosh, I'm late. Why didn't you wake me up? Here! Dad. This bicycle is... Will be yours only if you can get a GPA above two, at least once. This is the final year if you aren't trying your best... I won't be able to get into college. You will be stuck here for the rest of your life. This girl! Mom, Dad, I'm off to school. The year is 1997. Asia's economy is going through a crisis so I'm always broke. Green Wave was born. Lam Truong has just released his very first album, "Baby I Love You." But I still haven't said "I love you" to anyone. This is my senior year, my classmates will go everywhere for college so if you love anybody, just let them know. That's what I believe. My classmates only worry about studying, bonus points, and which college to choose. For me, I know my own fate with the low grades I have, I'm just going to be stuck here. - Hey! - I'm sorry. How dare you run here? Stop! - Our teacher hasn't come in yet. - How come you are so late? Students, attention! Oh, no! What? I'm sorry. Ms. Huong, you look beautiful today. What are you laughing at? Is this the newcomer? Yes. Thank you. Dear students, please welcome our newcomer who just moved here from the city. This is Nguyen Viet An. Come on in, please. This moment, the first time I saw Viet An, I knew that I no longer had freedom. Hello, Viet An! Can I suck your honey, please? Silly Thu, what are you doing? Go back to your seat! It's just Thu. Silly Thu. Silly Thu. Silly Thu. - Thu! - Yes, ma'am. Last year, you were the only student with a GPA under two, you were at the bottom. I just hope that this year you will focus on studying and try your best. Don't daydream all day long. I demand you not to drag our class' achievement down. Got it? Ma'am! I promise I will improve my studying result to pull our rank up. - Viet An, come sit next to Hong Hoa. - Okay. Hey, how do you think you will improve yourself? We are study partners, aren't we? Forget about it. Hey! Hey, Viet An. Get out of the way! Don't hang out with Silly Thu. He's such a bad student. That's Skinny Hai. He's been a top student for years. Even Chieu Minh, the president of our class, can't compete with him. But after being friends with Thu, his ranking just went down with no brake. You agree with her? - I don't know. - She said I'm stupid. She's right. Before Viet An appeared, Chieu Minh used to be the treasure of our class. The boys in our class even fought with boys from another class because one of them dared to pursue her. Hey, boys! Even though she is an orphan, she is a good student, she is nice and beautiful so we all admire her. But now, Viet An is the most beautiful girl in our class. Viet An. And she knows it. As a result, she always keeps a cold face despite our admiration, ignoring all the stupid things that the boys do to get her attention. CHUAN BERMUDA That's why being friends with Viet An is more difficult than flying into the sky. Focus! Wow, our teacher is so handsome. This year, no one will be excused from this PE class. I know you guys look down on my class. However, in order to study well, you need to have good health. Got it? - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! You also need to have good health, teacher. I just made you a cup of coffee. Please take it. I'm sorry to bother you. Thank you. Don't be! Quiet, please. Giving her flowers and showing off. None of that worked on Viet An. Objectively, her cold attitude is very hateful. Subjectively, the more hateful girls are, the more we like them. That's the dilemma. According to Alexander Pushkin, love is one of the most sacred and mystical things in the chart of human emotions. It's full of mystery, fascination, miracles, passion, and desire that we can't explain. I love everything about Viet An. I always think of her. Her eyes. Her smile. Her hair. Even her name seems strangely familiar and close to me as if I fell in love with it in my previous life. Who can read the next stanza? Hai! Pushkin wrote, "The name that was long forgotten, in a new crazy storm of emotion. It doesn't strike a bit in your soul... of the sweet gentle old memories." Viet An. Viet An. Viet An. Viet An. I rarely have a chance to talk to Viet An. Classes have gone by emotionlessly like water in the river. I'm like a single leaf, floating in the water sometimes looking back at Viet An and feeling sad. Mom, Dad, I'm off to school. Let's go! Are you crazy? Why are you wearing a jacket in this weather? I have a plan to show off to Viet An. I haven't seen you talking to her for a month. Necessity is the mother of invention! Let's go! Hey, wait for me. Fifteen minutes left, if you're done, submit your test and you may leave. You're done? See you. Okay. Hey, I'll go first. Bye. - Did you do well? - Not really. Viet An. Are you calling me? Yes. There are ink stains on your dress. Gosh! There's a lot of ink. Someone must have splashed it on your dress. Definitely! Silly Thu. Do you know who did this? If I do, I will beat him to death. But it's okay, wash it with liquid bleach and it's going to go away. Hold on! Let me help cover it. Thanks. Thank you. Hey, Viet An, how was the test? It was easy, no need to ask. No one asked you, shorty. Viet An, are you hungry? Let's go find some food. No, we're going home. Dear listeners, this is the song that ranked top on the Green Wave Billboard this week. It's one of the songs that stayed on the Billboard the longest. Please listen to Tinh Thoi Xot Xa with the voice of Lam Truong. If you like her that much, sing a song for her in front of your school. Don't misguide me. You know nothing. Girls always like such romantic presents. This song is dedicated to Viet An. Spring is up high Thousands of flowers Are glittering with sunlight My innocent kiss belongs to you You're so elegant that I'm crazy about you My love feels like A gentle long sleep Oh, my girl Why did we meet? Now I'm thinking about you Oh, my feelings for you Seem so up high in the sky Hey! How dare you! Mom, Dad, he's been like that all day. This song closes our Best Songs of All Time Show today. Good night and see you in our next shows. Hi, Viet An. Hi, Viet An. Hey, Silly Thu, why did you splash ink on Viet An's dress yesterday? What? When? Who told you such bullshit? Don't deny it, I have evidence. That's why yesterday, you gave Viet An your jacket, right? Hey, mean girl, where's your evidence? That's right, show us. It was Chieu Minh who saw everything. Hey, Pinky Flower, why do you always stick your nose into Viet An's business? What about you? You stick your nose into all of Silly Thu's stuff too. Hey, what if Chieu Minh mistook me for someone else? Right, people can be lookalikes. Stop denying. Come apologize to Viet An. Quick! - No way. - What? Weird guy! How come you are so fond of me today? So you haven't talked to Viet An for a month? He didn't even dare to get near her, not to mention talking. Hey, enough talking. Done with the homework? Hey! Are you and I, study partners or two cows pulling each other up and down? What do you mean cows pulling each other? Well, your brother is so lazy I have to pull him up. You mean you are a cow, right? Phuong, which side are you on? But Thu, you are so lame. You are at the bottom of the class and can't get the girl you like. Little Devil, you know nothing. If you want to make up with Viet An, you have to be the first to talk. Better luck next time. Right? Viet An. What? What are you reading? Giamilia by Aimatov. Is that good? Good. So Can I borrow it once you finish? - Thu. - Yes? I finished this book a while ago, I'm just reading it again. Please keep it in good condition. - Sure! - Remember don't splash ink on my book. So many times I want to tell you I love you But I haven't been able to Put it all together Thank you, Viet An. - Well. - It's such a good book. It's nothing. It's time for class. Well... Viet... An. The phenomenon where two waves are superimposed to form a resultant wave of greater or lesser amplitude is called "interference." What are the conditions for wave interference? - Thu! - Yes? Viet An? What did you write in my book? Oh, it's nothing. Just some lyrics I found interesting. Who asked you to write in my book? Why don't you write on yours? Get me a new book. Wait, Viet An. What about my drawing? What drawing? I thought it was trash so I threw it away. Ma'am, do you have this book? Here's your book. Thu! Come back here. Is the book torn? Sorry, I didn't check it carefully yesterday. Read this book, also by Aimatov. It's good. I don't know if Viet An is playing with me or not but I have never been in such misery. No girl could trouble me like this when I was a kid. - It's me who troubled the girls. - 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100. Ready or not. Here I come! Where are you? Found you! It hurts! It hurts so bad. God, it hurts so bad. It hurts so bad. Are you all right, Thu? Got you! Are you okay? You've got a bump on your forehead. Is it bleeding? - No. - It's all because of you! Why me? Because you hid so well. But we're playing hide and seek, I've got to hide well. But you did so well that I thought you were kidnapped. I was so worried that I tripped. Anyway, I'm done with this game. How about skipping rope? It's a girls' game, play it by yourself. Throwing cans? You have rubber bands, right? You want to play skipping rope? One time I shot dozens of birds then roasted them. They are yummy! Dozens? Really? That was nothing compared to when I caught a hundred of them. Poor them because you shot them dead. You missed it. Why do you always miss it? It's because of you! Why me? Because the birds see you, they don't stand still for me to shoot. How come? Who knows? Ask the birds. I'll stay home tomorrow then. Yes, you stay at home. I'll stay at home too. Why don't you go? I don't like shooting birds anymore. So what else can we play? You think about it. Why don't you? Me? I'm busy thinking about other stuff. Want to play pool later? Yes, I'll bring my friend, Hung. Hey, this is fun. Bring him in. Thu! Thu! What? Have you finished reading The White Ship? Yes! No, not yet. Just half of it. Why so slow? Finish it quickly so I can lend it to Hong Hoa. Can I return it the day after tomorrow? No. Finish it tonight and give it back to me tomorrow. How can I? Why not? I have to sleep. Then don't! Hai, help me! Being tired because of the heat, he turned into a fish. His tail, body, fin, all become like fish. Wow, Viet An. Why do you look so exhausted? No. I had to stay up until 3 a.m. to finish the book. Gosh. I was just joking. I didn't know. Here, for you. What's wrong? Nothing, I'll save it. Why? For when I'm hungry. Isn't it because you are afraid of getting a cavity? Okay, save that one and eat this one. No, you keep it. Here. Where did you get all the candies? Well, I bought them. You love candies that much? Yes. From now on you don't have to buy candies anymore. VINH HUNG GROCERY STORE - Why did he only get one chocolate bar? - Let's go talk to him. - Hey, Silly Thu. - Yes? Why did you buy only one chocolate bar for Viet An? Well... We are three people. I will buy three next time then. - Good boy. - Go away! - What's up? - Nothing. - Let's do some laps, kids. - Yes, sir. - Thu! - What? Want to play pool this afternoon? No, I'm busy. You are so weird this week. I have to study. Study? Do you know your ear wiggles every time you lie? Wiggle, my ass. - Hey. - Yes? - Do you have any money? - Why? Can I borrow some? - How much? - Well... - This is good. - Hey! Silly Thu, why don't you buy sugar-apple jam? Tieu Li, taking you out all day makes me hungry. I'm so hungry. I have bread. I would like to share it with you. Good idea. The bread will turn bad if you keep it for too long. Yes. Beto, behave. Here! Is that what you call half? I can't shoot birds if I'm hungry. That's why I kept missing them. You eat so slowly. Give it to me! Let me help you. Here. - Tieu Li. - Yes? Next time don't forget to share good food with me, okay? Okay. Hai! Come play. What? You have any money? Lend me some, please. You've been spending a lot lately, huh? Spending what? Don't you see I got a flat tire? Are five dollars, okay? Shakespeare once said, "Neither a borrower nor a lender be, for a loan oft loses both itself and a friend." I'm not going to let you fool me the second time. What do you mean? What do you think? Five dollars is enough for you to fix the tires of all the people living here! You're so silly. Now the back tire is flat, what if the front one turns flat later? Just in case. Flat tire, my butt. If you don't want to lend me some, it's fine. Screw it! Whatever! Why are you still here? My friend, he's not a stranger. I've spent all my money buying things for Viet An. I have a question. - Do you know what a donkey is? - Yes. You are as stupid as a donkey. Dude! You want to die, huh? Am I wrong? You spent all your money on her for nothing. Ask God if you could ever get back the money you spent on girls. You guys don't know anything. Maybe she has feelings for me. According to what? Well, I just guess. There is no room for guessing in love. He's right. You can't guess in love. You have to base it on scientific background. But how? Write a letter. Write her a letter? I'm going to be so embarrassed if she reads it for the whole school. True. I once wrote to your sister, Phuong. The next day, she read it for the whole class. I could never forget that feeling. See, he's experienced. You guys are so dumb. Who told you to write essay-like letters? Be brief, only use three words. Take this. Viet An and Thu. Love, no love. Not in love yet. Almost in love... Fold it then hand it to her. She'll choose the answer. Then you'll know. Dude, it's love, not a multiple-choice test. Why not? If you want it shorter, just write two sentences. Viet An loves Thu. Viet An doesn't love Thu. Draw boxes under them so she can tick one. Then you will know. What if she ticks the "No" box? Then you get to be a man again, not a donkey anymore. - Hai! - Yes? I prefer to be a donkey. A very cute one that Viet An can't resist. Hey! Go ahead then. Let's play, Hung. Step aside. I'm sorry. Speak well of me in front of Phuong, okay? My money. Thanks, Hai. Dude! BITTER LOVE - Viet An. - Yes? - Want to go see a movie? - Which movie? Bitter Love, it's a good one. You know I like candies so you're asking me to see Bitter Love, huh? Have you gotten tickets? Here! Awesome! Let me ask Hong Hoa to join. Oh, what's wrong? - You two go see the movie. - You're not going? I've seen it already. Thanks a lot then. Okay, you're welcome. You're doomed. What does that mean? Meaning you're out. Out, my ass. Damn, you. You get out now. What? See you, man. Damn! I'm doomed? Doomed, am I? SECRET NOTEBOOK Secret notebook? My dad bought me this so I can write my stories. He said I can write anything I like on it. You like to write stories? Yes. I like to draw too. This is a story about Little Cloud. Is this Little Cloud? Yes, I was afraid no one would recognize it. And this is a story about a Blue Haired Princess. Once upon a time, there was a Blue Haired Princess. One day, a prince moves in next to her place. His hair is so messy. Your stories are good but your drawings suck. Right, they are ugly. I can draw this stuff in the blink of an eye. Wow! You are good! I have ten whorl fingerprints. Let me imprint one on my drawing as a signature. Okay. Only love can turn a donkey to a man and a man to a donkey. Chieu Minh! Class president. Keep silent! Keep silent! Chieu Minh, do it again! Chieu Minh. Teacher, she has fainted. Step away. Chieu Minh! How is Chieu Minh? She's conscious now. I also informed her family already. It was my fault. I shouldn't have forced her. Luc, you're new to this school, so it's okay. You didn't know. Chieu Minh has heart disease. I hope you pay more attention to her from now on. Girls aren't as naive as you think. They pretend they don't care, but it means you are out. Out, my butt. Close your arms. - Hai. - What? - Can you do me another favor? - Speak. Can you get me two more movie tickets? I will invite her to go with me myself. Quiet please, Ms. Anh is sick today so her class is canceled. - Who wants to play gomoku? - No. Hey. Gomoku anyone? Bullshit. Hai! Can you hold the shorty off for me for a bit? I'll play. The winner can flick the loser's ears. Skinny Hai dares to challenge Gomoku Queen. Bring it on. - Viet An! - Yes? Was the movie Bitter Love good? I thought you had seen it already. Why don't you know? Well, everyone has their own opinion. I think it's good, but I don't like the ending. Why? Well, the two main characters loved each other so much but they didn't end up together. Right, love like that is better if you don't. So how do you think one has to love someone? Me? Love means to be together forever. You said it like you have already loved someone that much. Not yet but I think that's how love should be. Come on, Skinny Hai! One more game! Go, Skinny Hai! Let's do rock-paper-scissors to flick each other's ears. - Let's do it! - Let's do it! Let's play! One, two, three! - Viet An. - Yes? - Want to go see another movie? - Which one? My Best Friend's Wedding. But I haven't seen it. That's great, you can go with Hong Hoa. I already watched this one. Liar. Are you crazy? Yes. Oh, no. I mean... Viet An! Excuse me. Keep silent! Get back to your seats. Fine, I lost. Loser! Who threw trash here? These are movie tickets for tonight. Let's go! Hey, are you guys skipping classes? No, we are going on a field trip. Right. - For our next biology class. - Right. Can I go with you? - No! - Yes! - They're skipping classes. - You want her to go? - It's my chance - You know I hate Hong Hoa, don't you? - She flicked my ears so bad. - Skipping classes... It's your chance to get back at her. They're skipping classes for real. - Let's go! - Let's go! Be careful! Thu, be careful! Hurry up, Viet An. - No. - I will go first. Come here. - Up. - Be careful. - Jump! - Up! Slow down, dude. Hey, lend me your shoulder so I can step on it. I'm not a donkey for you to ride. - Quick. - Hurry up, both of you. Okay. One, two, three, up. Hold on, it's not good. You're so useless! - Stop! - What now? You're so useless! - No, you are! - I will lift you up. Okay. One, two, three, up. Get your hands off me! What are you doing? Molesting me? - Oh, my god. What are you doing? - Get up. Slowly. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. - Got it? - Jump down! - Your turn, Viet An. - Hai, you go first. Mr. Luc! Ms. Huong, you forgot your lesson plan. Thank you. Okay, Viet An? Ms. Huong and Mr. Hinh! - Hurry up! - Hurry up! - Viet An! - Get up. Thu. It's okay! - Get up! - Thu! - My mom has just arrived earlier. - Mr. Luc. - Do you want to come over tonight? - I'm busy tonight. It's too high. What should I do now? - Hurry up! - It's not going to work. Get down now, Viet An. It's too late. Get down. Where are you going? What about tomorrow night? I'm busy too. I'm busy every day. Let's go! - Hey, you two! - Where are you going? Hey! Hey! I'm sorry. Mr. Luc! Ms. Huong! Pervert! Gosh! There is a man in the female restroom. Thu, next time, don't skip classes. You have a bad influence on others. NGUYEN HIEN HIGH SCHOOL Hey! Attention! Sit down, please. Hey! Shorty! Why is Viet An off today? Sick. Lovesick. Cold. Are you going to visit her? Can I go with you? Viet An! Someone's bringing oranges for you. Just lay still. No need to sit up. Can I sit? Can anyone help you take notes yet? No one. I will borrow from someone's notebooks when I get back to school. Perhaps I can help you then. Okay. If you have time. If she has no special feelings for you she won't let you help her take notes. Because girls are so picky at choosing who can write in their notebooks. Hemingway was an author with a minimalist style. His writing often means a lot more than what was actually written. Just like in his short story Hills Like White Elephants. At first, it seems to be just a normal conversation between two people. But after we think about it thoroughly we will realize that it is an important decision for the two main characters. Just like his iceberg theory in which only a small amount of information is revealed. - As a result let's read, study, - Where's your notebook? - And feel all the beauty of his work. - Why aren't you taking notes? I've been taking notes for Viet An, my arms are so tired. So I decided to take notes for her only. That way I don't have to do it twice. How dare you? What if the teacher calls you up for a test? I've already been called a few times, there won't be anymore. Plus, it is very normal if I miss the notes for one or two lessons. Teacher! Thu! Yes, ma'am. Why aren't you taking notes? This isn't yours. Where is your notebook? I am taking notes. Where are the notes on the previous lesson? Also the one before that? Why aren't you taking notes in class? No, ma'am. It's because I ran out of ink. So you don't have any ink left to take notes but still have plenty to draw silly things. What is this? "My love for you is like water off a duck's back." Why are you laughing so hard? You're like a baby. Let me hold your hand. Watch out for the vehicles. Mom, let go of my hand. I can go by myself. Look at Tieu Li. She's walking alone. Thu! Thu is so naughty, please keep an eye on him. I will. Please don't worry. Goodbye, teacher. Goodbye. Thu, remember to behave in class, okay? Please listen to your teacher, don't talk in class or get into fights, okay? Mom, I got it. Please go home. - You've been here longer, please help him. - Yes, ma'am. Oh, my love. I'm going home now. Goodbye, Tieu Li. So you're the boss, huh? I'm not. My mom asked you to watch over me. No, she didn't ask me to watch over you, just to help you. How can you help me? I don't know. But I do. She meant you could help me take notes when I'm lazy. That's how you can help me. She didn't mean that. She's my Mom, not yours. How could you know what she meant? Let me ask her again this afternoon then. No need. Don't ask. You can share it with me. What if you're out of ink? I don't know. Tomorrow you can fill it with more water. Tieu Li, let's go to school. Wait for me. I've filled it with a lot of water. You're so stupid. I told you to fill just a little. Now the ink has become so faint. I didn't know that. Oh, shoot. Tieu Li, what happened? It's nothing. Where does this ink come from? - Where? - I... accidentally spilled it. Why haven't you written anything? Tieu Li. My ink is too faint to write. Tieu Li? Go to the corner. Hurry up! Others may continue. Tieu Li, these are for you. It's okay, girls don't play marbles. You're so silly. I'm not telling you to play marbles. You can put them in a glass vase, add some water, and put it on your desk. It'll be nice. Yes, thank you. It's so beautiful. This vase is okay but a little too big. When I win more marbles, I will give it to you to fill it up. You promise? Sure. So beautiful. I will never ask you to take notes for me again. Who do you imply with "off a duck's back"? No one, I just thought it was a good quote. You always write rubbish in others' notebooks. Don't you remember the last time you wrote in my book? Are you free this afternoon? What for? To go see a movie. With whom? With me. Really? It's okay if you're busy. No, I'm free. - Free. - See you at 5 p.m. - at the International Theater then. - Okay. BITTER LOVE FAREWELL SUMMER Hey! Viet An! Nice bike, sorry. Thu! - Viet An. - Have you been here long? No, I've just arrived. I said to meet here at 5 p.m. I mean I came here at 4:30 p.m. Can you go buy the tickets? Is front row seats, okay? Three tickets. Why three? Why are you so grumpy going to the movies with girls? Well, I'm just tired because of waiting in line for tickets. Tired? Eating a guava will help. Viet An! Here, sit next to me. As long as I am still the principal of this school I would never accept such an affair between a teacher and a student. Go home and make up your mind. Hey! How come you are sleeping while watching a movie with your friends? Don't you feel ashamed? Good movie, huh? It sucks. It's good! How come you say it sucks? Because... Why? Because three people went to see the movie. Three people are fun. If you don't like that, I'm not going to ask you to come with us next time. - Okay. - No, I mean two people will have more fun. Okay, two people sound good. Next time, you and Hong Hoa can go together. Right, Viet An said you're going to ask me to see a movie but you never did. Hey, let's go to Bui Thi Xuan street for some sweet soup. - Yes. - You go ahead, I'm busy. Busy with what? I have an appointment. With some girl? Thu. BITTER LOVE Did you bring more marbles for me? No, I need to take them back. But why? Why what? I lost all of mine. I need them to play for revenge. I won't give them to you. What if you lose these too? No way. Give them to me. Give it back. Give me the vase back. Vase? Here's your vase. And the flower too. Beautiful. Stop crying. Tomorrow, I will give you double the marbles. Give them back to me, please. If not, I will not hang out with you anymore. Whatever. One marble for holding down the fort. Dude, I took notes for you yesterday. You owe me two marbles. - Okay. - Remember to pay me tomorrow, okay? Just go. Hey, Scab-face! - What? - Can I share your ink bottle? No. Unless you contribute your ink. But I don't have any here with me. Bring some tomorrow. Sure, I will. Don't forget. - I won't. - Keep your promise, okay? Thu, you forbid me to come But Hong Hoa keeps showing up Bullshit! Are you crazy? Hey, if Hong Hoa keeps being the third wheel like that even my grandpa couldn't do anything, more so, me. The problem lies in Viet An, not Hong Hoa. If she hadn't asked, Hong Hoa wouldn't have come along. Right? So What should I do? Keep moving forward, of course. But how? I think you should stay away from her for a while. That's moving backward, not forward. You don't get it. This is a philosophy that only a few smart people can understand. That's why I don't get it at all. Dude! Girls are mysterious human beings. There is a French saying, "Suit l'amour, l'amour fuit, fuit l'amour, l'amour suit." Still don't get it. It means, "Follow love and it will flee, flee love and it will follow thee." Just stay away from her for a while and she will start coming to you. You mean I have to move to another town? Idiot. Or you mean I can't go to school? No way! No. You don't have to stay at home. Then I must put on a cold face. Very cold. Cold as ice. Cold as ice. - Thu! - What? Let me play this pants pulling game. What? Today, Viet An glanced at you twice. It's a good start. You have to act colder. - Colder? - Yes. - How much colder? - Much colder. Yes. Don't smile! Cold as ice. Okay. - That's enough, I'm too tired. - Me too. "You're walking without hesitation, I'm following at a distance. Heartless like in the middle of a poem. We are like a pair of rhymes." Thank you. So in your opinion, does Viet An like me or not? What about the French saying, "Suit l'amour, amour la suit, suit la fuit suit." I've put on a cold face for a whole week, but her face is even colder than mine. This just saves me money from buying stuff for them. Hey, kid! What the heck? I'm still talking to you. Are you upset? Should I be happy? So you think your sudden coldness makes Viet An happy? What are you doing here? I just want to lend you this good book. Have you read it? Not yet. How do you know it's a good book? Well... Which book? Here. The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years by Aimatov. So you haven't talked to me for how many centuries? No! It's not like that, I've just been so busy. Liar. It's true. I'm imitating the French. "Imitating the French"? Yes, French people are always busy. Geez! Pretend to be busy. You're nonsense. Where is my ink? I don't have any. Why? I don't need to share your ink anymore. But you used it yesterday. Just a tiny bit. It still counted. I wouldn't have let you if I knew you were such a liar. A miser! None of your business. Not only a scab-face but also a miser! Pay me back with just a few drops of ink. I won't, not even one drop. You dare to fool me? So what? Game on! - Game on! - Calm down. Don't fight with him. Let me give him some ink instead. Don't give him anything. See what he can do. You stay out of the way. Tieu Li! Are you okay? It's bleeding. My head is injured. Am I going to be okay, Thu? Hello, ma'am. Back to your seat. Five stitches must have hurt so bad, huh? Just a little because I was sedated. But there will be a scar. A scar? It will make you look ugly. Maybe my long hair can cover the scar. Don't you think so? Maybe. Hey! If your mom asks, don't tell her that I'm involved, okay? No, I won't. I will tell her that I tripped. On your own? On my own. No one pushed me. If you tell your mom, and she tells my mom, I will be beaten. I know. I won't say a word about you. But please don't stop hanging out with me. I feel so sad for the last few days. Yes, me too. There was something missing when I didn't hang out with you. "When a girl plays with a boy, there will be some babies born." Son of a bitch. Thu! Yes, ma'am. How did Tieu Li get her wound? Her head hit the desk. Why did Tieu Li say she hit a brick? Well... I really don't know. That's what I heard from my classmates. Maybe it was a brick. Our school has a lot of bricks. Where is Tieu Li? She's in her room and still has a fever. You can come see her. Tieu Li. Do you feel better yet? Why sit out here? Just a little bit better. Here's your notebook. - You finished some new drawings? - Yes. It's not the complete notebook but I have an idea for the ending of the Blue Haired Princess and Messy Haired Prince. Wow, your drawings are so good. This is for you. Wow. SECRET NOTEBOOK Blue Haired Princess only loves Messy Haired Prince. Well, Messy Haired Prince grows up and becomes Silly Prince. - How come? - Why not? When he grows up he'll become more and more silly. You are a donkey! Why did you come to Viet An's house? You almost did it. If I stay away from her, she will let me go for good. Girls are always like that. They never see what we do for them but only what we don't do. Yes. This has to stop. What do you mean? The uncertain feeling is the worst for a person in love. I don't get it. By all means, you have to get out of this dangerous situation. Got it? But how? A letter. She usually passes by here on her way to school. Right? You mean I will wait for her here to hand her my letter. Yes. Hai! But it seems so sudden. Why so sudden? Don't just hand her the letter. You have to deliver the letter with some emotion. I assure you that she will be so touched if you give her the letter with some tears in your eyes. Believe me. A man's tears are the girls' weakness. He's right! - Lottery tickets! - What's that? Lottery tickets. Lucky at cards, unlucky in love. Screw you. No gambling whatsoever! It's not... a strategy of humiliation anymore. I'm literally humiliated now. Throw it away then. We will find another way. Skinny Hai. Can you help me deliver the letter, please? What are you thinking? What if she thinks I like her then she loves me back? Tough case. - No way she will love you back. - Don't push me. If you agree to help me, the ivory chess set will be yours. - Agreed. - Let me help you. I will be her sister-in-law, I'm sure she will take the letter. "Sad days, missing months, lovesick years. My dearest Viet An! I'm writing this when the last daylight is fading but thinking about you lights me up inside. Many times, I have questioned myself why I like you so much. My heart often skips a beat when I catch your eyes and your smile. Since the day you moved to our class I feel so happy, seeing you smile every day. Your smile has made my day even if it's raining or storming out there. Deep in my thoughts, your image is carved..." "I wish I could take your hand then we would run around the dreamy hills and I would put some purple flowers in your hair." THE BEST LOVE LETTERS IN THE WORLD Thu. Can you see my scar? No, it's covered by your hair. I can't see it. Take a closer look. Can you still see it? Not unless you put your hair aside like this. Understood? - Probably no one will notice, huh? - Yes. People say that Thu is good and Li is beautiful. The two are in love with each other. Two families permit their relationship. Shut up or I'll tell the teacher. What happened, Thu? It's nothing. "When a girl plays with a boy, there will be some babies born." Thu. Thu. Thu. This is for you to stop saying stupid things. I will kill you. Here's for you to stop stupid things. Stop being a son of a bitch. I will kill you. I will kill you. Dare not to pay me back. I'll teach you a lesson. You guys stop fighting. I will tell the teacher tomorrow. I don't care. I will kill you. Thu, fight back. Go, Thu! Give up yet? Okay. - Will you stop teasing us? - Yes, I will. - Really? - Really! - Swear. - I swear. What do you swear? I swear if I say those things again, a car will hit me. Tieu Li. - Yes? - I have something for you. What's that? - Well... - It's fun! This is a magic studying leaf. Put it in your book and you will learn the lessons very quickly. - Really? - Yes. Thank you. When the summer comes, I will dry flamboyant flowers into butterflies for you. Devil Phuong failed so badly. She ruined my plan. So now, when she passes by, pretend like you're going that way too and accidentally sees her. Once you go with her to school you can't help talking to her. Yes, I will. Once you talk to her, you can't help giving her my letter. Yes, I will. Once you give it to her, she can't help but take it. Yes, she will. Once she takes it, she can't help but love me. - Yes, she will. - And she will love me not you. Okay, the time has come. Just go. Hold on. The ivory chess set as promised. Conceal the deal! Seal the deal! Whatever. What? The bus is coming! Quickly! - You're too talkative. - I know. Go. Here she comes. Go. Go. - Viet An. - Hai? You're going to school? Yes. Can I leave this here? You're not going with Thu today? Thu? His house is in a different direction. Today I'm discovering a new route just on my own. But I don't know where to go from here. Do you take this route every day to school? Yes, I go that way. What a coincidence! Let's go together. - Yes, such a coincidence. - Let's go together. So you go discovering a new route everyday huh? Yes. Have you ever been lost? Sir! Can you stop the car, please? What the hell are you doing in my car? Get off! Where is this place? Why am I upset? I've been waiting for someone for so long There must be something wrong Since the beginning What is happening? I'm getting more and more distressed What now? Keep on moving Or withdrawing or just being silent? Look at me There's nothing happy in this life Is it you that make me distressed? Thanks to you that I'm upset Thanks to you that I know pain Let's wait and see where my love is going I don't know what to say Time goes by, what's the point of love We will say goodbye tomorrow anyway Oh, well, I'm just sitting here To sing away my sadness But the more I sing, the more I love you My guitar is singing too Where have you been all day? Why didn't you come to class? Been chasing chickens. You look so worn out. So how did it go? Did she reply? Reply, my ass. It's your letter. She didn't take it. Here. You are fooling around with me, aren't you? She didn't take it but still replied, huh? It's a letter from Ms. Huong inviting your parents to see her tomorrow. It's all because of you. Rubbish. Now you blame everything on me, huh? It's because you kept saying Viet An liked me. It's just my guess. Your guess? How come you always guess? But I don't understand. - Albert Camus said... - Screw you and your Albert Cameo. Useless philosophy. Let me ask you. Have you really been in love? I've loved a billion people. So if you were in my shoes what would you do so that they would love you back? In this case How the hell would I know? Those billions of people never loved me back. What the heck? So you know nothing about love. You're such a low-class advisor. All you know is quoting from the others. - What about you? - What about me? Since Viet An came all you only talk about is her! And you? You've been using me to experiment with your bullshit love theories. - Were you able to help me? - You're saying I didn't help you at all? Who did you go to when you needed to borrow money? Who? - If it weren't for the chess set... - I'm fed up with your love. You probably didn't give Viet An my letter either. You mean I lied to you? Who knows? You're jealous because Viet An likes me. You pretended that you gave her my letter but you actually never did. You not only broke my heart but also got the chess set. Killed two birds with one stone. You kept talking about me being out. Get out now, please. You're such a bad friend. Did you just get scolded? Why are you crying? In a few days, I'm leaving. When are you coming back? I'm not coming back. What do you mean by not coming back? It means I'm not coming back here. Where are you going? Why are you going? To the city. I don't know. Mom just told me that. But you have to stay until the end of this school year. I told my Mom too, but she didn't listen. She said she's coming to school tomorrow to inform my teachers. This one is for you. Spun sugar. Spun sugar. Hai! Hey! I'm sorry about the other day, I was a bit... Shut up. I'm tired. Hai! Why are you throwing rocks at my window? Because you ignored me. Hey! I will pay you back the money. - Forget about it. - Plus this is your ivory chess set. You know what, Silly Thu? I've just realized - friendship is eternal - Yes! Until one of you gets a girlfriend. And after he gets dumped, it's eternal again. Hey. What? Want to play pool? Now? I'll be right back. Okay. Chieu Minh, go get some rest. No, I'll jump. Hills Like White Elephants. I've been thinking about it. Go get some rest. Hills Like White Elephants? Hemingway was an author with a minimalist style. His writing often means a lot more than what was actually written. Just like his short story Hills Like White Elephants. Chieu Minh! If you want to jump do ten laps around the yard then. Do it. Hurry up. Sir, you know about her health condition. What did you say? Do you want to help her? You do it then. Hurry up. Hey. Now I understand the real meaning of Hills Like White Elephants. At first, it seems to be just a normal conversation. It's a really awfully simple operation. They just let the air in. I will go there with you. Everything will be fine. And then what? We will be like in the old days. But after we think about it thoroughly we will realize that it is an important decision for the two main characters. I will jump for both of them. Fine, the whole class, everyone will do ten laps. Hurry up. The man wants the woman to get an abortion and then pretends like nothing has happened. Thu. - What's wrong? - Son of a bitch. What's that? - What happened? - Nothing. Why did you hit Mr. Luc? Why do you dare? Chieu Minh. I'm sorry. Now everyone knows your story because of me. It's not like what you imagined. I was so stupid. The doctor told me my heart disease can start to kick in at any time. I'm so scared. I've been an outstanding student for 11 years. But now I can't even solve my own life quiz. Nat King Cole once sang. "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return." We promise we will never leave you. My apologies to you and the school. Chieu Minh! Come in. I'm sorry, Dad. Skipping classes. Writing love letters. Ranking at the bottom and even hitting your teacher. Is there anything that you don't dare to do, Thu? That's enough. No more going out. No new bicycle for you either. The school board cannot accept a teacher having a romantic relationship with a student. The board has decided to expel Chieu Minh and end the contract with Mr. Luc. I will take Chieu Minh to the city to find treatment for her heart disease. Thu! - Hi! - Hey. Viet An. How did you find my house? I asked Hai. So why are you here? Just want to come over and hang out with you. Do you sell cold drinks? No. So why have you had such a cold face these days? How come you stopped buying candies for me? I'm broke. Why don't you ask me to lend you money? Well... I often forget to pay it back. I'd never ask you to. You're so silly. A silly and lazy student. If you don't focus on your studies and can't get into college you'll be stuck here forever. It's too late. I'm already suspended from school. Just for one week. It's not a big deal. Mr. Luc spoke for you too. That's why I'm here today. Listen up. Starting tomorrow, Hai will help you study in the morning. I will help you in the afternoon. But first, get that expression off your face. It looks awful. - I want to... - You want to talk about the letter? I don't need to read your letter to know what's written inside. You're silly. It's only one month until the end of the school year. Music Gift has just received a request from Viet An. She wants to send a song to her friends, Anh Thu, Hong Hoa, Chieu Minh, and everyone in her Class 12A3 to remind her friends of schooltime memories. The song Tinh Tho by Ngoc Linh. Attention! Go to your seat. Thu! Viet An. Thu. Viet An. Yes! WITH LOVE YEARBOOK CLASS 12A3 GOODBYE 12A3 I found out that girls on this planet, I don't know about other planets seem to come out of the same mold. What do you mean? All girls have one similar habit. I'm not saying it's good or bad but almost all girls have it. As soon as a relationship turns from the secret investigation phase to the official recognition phase every girl asks their boyfriend just one question. What's the question? How many girls have you loved before me? So Hai, how many girls have you loved before me? That hurts! Stop there. Hey, you! So how many girls have you loved before me? None. Really? Yes. 100 percent? Just 99 percent. What's the 1 percent? I used to have a girlfriend. Her name is Tieu Li. At that time, I hated her so much for leaving me so suddenly. I'm going to go say goodbye to Tieu Li's family. You're sure you don't want to come? I'm not coming. Please go. Thu! Thu, open the door, please. Thu. The notebook. Give me my Secret Notebook. Thu. Please give it back, Thu. I hate you. I burnt it. Tieu Li. - Yes? - Hurry up! Yes, Mom. Tieu Li! Tieu Li! I haven't heard anything from her since. Sometimes, I even dreamed that she came back to visit me. I'm sorry. That was a long time ago. I knew it. I shouldn't have told you. I'm surprised you could still remember everything since you were so little. I just want to see the Secret Notebook to make sure that Tieu Li was really a 7-year-old girl, not some girl that you imagined. Okay. Here it is. I'm so thirsty. I forgot, sorry. Viet An. Viet An, what are you doing? So beautiful. The Secret Notebook. Why? I don't want you to think about Tieu Li all the time, and then compare her to me. But she's just a 7-year-old girl. And that happened almost 10 years ago. So what? You should go home. Well... - I... - I must be so stupid to love you. - Thu! - Just go. Viet An. Give me back the notebook. But this is not yours. This is the last keepsake between Tieu Li and me. Really? Hey, be careful! Why is Tieu Li so important to you? You pushed me away just because of her notebook. I'm sorry. I promised Tieu Li that I will return this notebook to her. You remember everything about her? But there is one thing you wouldn't know. Tieu Li was very sad when you were mad at her for no reason. You didn't say goodbye to her. Thu, open the door, please. Thu. The notebook. Give me my Secret Notebook. Give it back, Thu. Please give it back, Thu. I hate you. I burnt it. Tieu Li actually believed that you hated her. But she never understood the reason why. The notebook you gave Tieu Li stays the same until today. Viet An, you are... You don't remember anything at all. My name has always been Viet An. But friends, family, and teachers always called me Tieu Li. Even you called me Tieu Li too. Hey! What's your name? Tieu Li. Why are you smiling? It's nothing. Suddenly, I remembered your missing teeth. Don't you have anything else to remember? I also remember... Hi, Tieu Li! My little friend.
