[music playing] Bonnie? Jackie? Oh my God, Jackie. Bonnie Blackwell. Oh my-- how good to see you. It's so good to see you. Thank you for coming. Thanks for inviting me. How are you? I'm fabulous. And I can be worse-- Thomas Marshall High School! I mean, look at you. You still look like a Greek goddess. Thanks. You're looking very prosperous yourself. Ah, you don't have to be so nice. I can never break those midnight runs for fast food. So I know the manager. Heaven. Oh my God, you just make me green with envy. What are you still doing? Gymnastics? No, I gave it up a long time ago. Didn't fit in with the marriage if you know what I mean. Yes, I do. The things we do for that band of gold. It's a crime sometimes. My God, it's so good to see you. What? What is that? Oh, God. It's nothing. Slipped in the kitchen, caught it on the refrigerator door. A little clumsy, I guess. Clumsy, yeah, I remember you being clumsy once when-- no, I've never remembered you being-- Darling, I'll tell you that. I'd like you to meet my husband Zach. He's a great guy. - Oh, good. OK. Zach. Zach. Zach, Honey. Zach. Sorry, I'd like you to meet a good friend of mine that I invited, Jackie Prentiss. We were in the pep squad back in the dark ages at Thomas Marshall High. That's nice. Nice to meet you. Honey, excuse me. Honey, I'm kind of in the middle of an important business meeting right now. Well, do you mind, Honey? Just thought you might want to meet. That's nice. Isn't that nice what she talked? So nice. Go get yourself something to eat. Something to drink. Get something. But actually-- Hey, guys. Hey, guys, can I get you something? Oh no, anything. Come on, you haven't eaten any. No, I guess we're just fine. Jenny, nice to meet you. Go get yourself something to eat. Oh. Sorry about that. Zach's been pretty much business these days. He's a commodities trader for the far East. Don't ask me what he trades. There's a lot of pressure on him. He does well though. I don't know even what I'd do without him. We can all dream, honey. Walk me to the bar, huh? You got to talk? Bonnie. Or you can have another silent epic. I have nothing to say to you, Zach. I think I have something to say. I have more important things to discuss, Bonnie. More important things to discuss than fashion tips, particularly, with your fat friends. Oh, yeah, you're really important stuff. Hey! Who the hell you think you're talking to? Huh? Huh? No! Don't hurt me please. - I don't have to what? Huh? I don't have to what? Hey, Bonnie, shut up! I put this roof over your head. I put you these fine clothes, Honey. I do, Honey. Honey, I love you, baby. And then what do you do? Huh? You bitch. Yeah, you bitch about having nothing to wear, huh? I didn't mean to butt in! I just don't like being embarrassed in front of visitors. Oh, baby, baby. I'm embarrassing, huh? I'm embarrassing. That's what you told that fat porky you were with, huh? [screaming] All right, I let you go. I let you go. Look, baby, I let you go. See, I let you go. I'll let you go. I'll let you go. Huh? Hey, you bad mouth me in public, Bonnie. And you know what that does to me. Huh? You know what that does to me. You know what that does to my business? Huh? You have any idea? You have any idea what you're saying, you stupid bitch? You stupid, stupid bitch. [crying] Get over there. Look at this. What is all of this, huh? What is this? What is this? What? You think you piss perfume? Huh? Is that what you think? You piss perfume? [screaming] Piss all up in you. Oh, do you hear that? Listen, listen, listen, listen, Honey. Shut up. Shut up! Listen. You're pissing off the neighbors again, Bonnie. You're pissing off the neighbors again, Bonnie. [screaming] You look pathetic. Shut up out there! Can't a guy have a discussion with his wife? Huh? God damn it, Bonnie. Oh, Bonnie. Come here, Bonnie. Bonnie. Bonnie? Don't play this game with me, Bonnie. Bonnie. Bonnie. Bonnie. Bonnie, open the door. I swear to Christ, I'll break this door down. Open the door. Bonnie. Open the door or I'll break it in half. It's all right. You've got to come out some time, baby. You've got to out some-- [screaming] No. OK, please. You bailing out on me, Bonnie? Is that what you're doing? Yeah, that's what you're doing. You planned this for some time, didn't you, Bonnie? I swear. What? You don't think I know how your head works? [screaming] That's how your head works, whore. [screaming] That's how your head works. You little whore. [engine starts] You want to know how your head works? I'll show you how your head works. [screaming] [crashing] [police sirens] You don't say anybody did anything, you hear? Can you believe it? Break problem. I guess, that's why we have insurance. Can I help you, officer? SGT. BILL STARR: Save the charm, Blackwell. We've been through this. Well, correct me if I'm mistaken, but unless you have some kind of warrant, you got no right to be here. Where's your wife, Mr. Blackwell? But my wife is my business. Hey! Hey! God, this one needs an ambulance. This is our sixth call in the past two months. Are you willing to wait for number seven? Tell him it's all right, Bonnie. No. I want to file a suit. [beeping in background] WOMAN [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: Dr. Flores, dial 182, please. Dr. Flores, please dial-- Morning. How do you feel? Kind of-- Kind of hurts when I breathe. You have a hairline fracture on one rib and your right cheek bone. You also have a little cartilage damage on your left shoulder and a few other bruises thrown in for good measure. It'll all heal if you give it a chance. Hey, Doc. Yeah. You charge extra for the place? It's all part of the deal. There's someone here to see you. Sergeant. Mrs. Blackwell. Is he? He's still in lock up. You still want to press charges? Yes. I have to now. If he ever came back home-- I think we can put him away for a long time. Time enough for you to get on your feet and decide what to do. I got you something. WOMAN [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main lobby. Dr. Kravitz-- Figured I'd get you some protection. Thank you, that's very sweet of you, Sergeant. Bill Starr, please. Bonnie. You must see a lot of people in trouble in your line of business. Why is this for me? Maybe I just got tired of acting like it didn't matter, like it was just part of the job watching women take it from creeps like that. There's nothing you could've done. I'm a cop. I'm supposed to be there. The whole hero complex, right? Well, I think you're a hero. When you get out of here, come see me. I'll show you a few pointers in self-defense. He won't stay in jail forever, Bonnie. You got time. Just think about it, OK? [beeping in background] Oh, my feet are killing me. Oh. Want some coffee. Yeah. You know, I don't think women will ever be totally liberated until we stop wearing high heels designed by men. I know, right? Give me the milk. You left the TV on. I know. I always do. Just as a precaution. You don't have to be so scared anymore, honey. The judge put him away for at least two years. Yeah, and then what happens after that? I mean, just look at me. I'm on my own, I don't even have a job or anything. Whoa. This is not the Bonnie Blackwell I remember. I do not like what the last eight years have done to you. Yeah. Hey, I did this to myself. That bastard has you running around like a church mouse. You know, you used to be such a jock in high school, had all the confidence I wanted. You got to get that back again, honey. Become the person that you really are. Yeah, you know, I think you're right about that, Jackie. Maybe I can do that and get career at the same time. Bill Starr's been talking to me. He had an idea. Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, Angie Dickinson. I did not say that you should become a cop. Nobody messes with cops. Everybody messes with cops. What do you want to hang around with the scum of the Earth for the rest of your life? Yeah, I think I did that already. Zach's going to get out someday, and I can't spend the rest of my life afraid of him. I'm so sick of it. Just let somebody else be afraid. You're scaring the hell out of me. [marching music] TRAINING OFFICER: Go, boy, let's go, on the wall. SGT. BILL STARR: If you really wanted to become a cop, the first thing you have to do is impress your training officer. It's going to take a lot of work and study before they accept you. Months of testing and training. I'm ready. I know I can do it though. I've always been a good student, and very athletic. And you don't even have to be easy on me. No chance of that. Everybody gets the same treatment. OK. Why don't you give that a try? Sure. [grunting] JARVIS: I don't think it's going to happen. Give me just a second, Jarvis. Here, let me show you how it's done. I got 20 years on you, kid. You've got to do a lot better than that. You have to be in as good a shape as the people you'll be chasing. Better. But don't worry, we'll get there. [martial arts chanting] Wow. God, that instructor's really tough. You ain't seen nothing yet. There's the man you have to impress. [grunting] Oh my God. A side of beef with an attitude. A real attitude. Wow. You ought to feel like crap. You know why? Because you got nothing. Nothing. You think you can beat them just with your body? You got to use your mind, your head. Huh? I'll tell you what, see Rodriguez over there? Watch me handle him. He's about my size. [grunting] Hello, Bill. - Hey, Lebell. How are you? How's Sammy? How's Sammy? She's OK. Great, great. This is Bonnie Blackwell, a personal friend. I've got a feeling she's going to be a tough recruit once I get through with her. Well, you better make her nice and tough. I hate it when they're too easy to kick around like Rodriguez over there. She'll do just fine. Is he OK? Hey, Rodriguez, Sleep good? Sorry, sir. I guess I deserved that one. So you still want to be a cop? Yes, I do. Can I ask you one question though? - Sure. - Who's Sammy? My daughter. Really? She was in a situation like you with that husband of yours. She took a lot of shit. She lost her first baby because of him. My grandchild. Oh, Bill, I'm sorry. Fresh meat. Get over here. Give me your jacket. Me? Yeah, come on, give me your jacket. [music playing] And the glasses. Now, get in there. Any of you two know each other? No. No. Riley, show her the first step to self-defense. [grunting] First rule, be alert. The world needs more alerts. Second rule, learn how to fall. Ronnie, take her through the routine. [grunting] God. Hey, Bill. What's an old war horse like you doing hanging out with the new guys? Ah, just fielding a new prospect. What, her? [grunting] I think your days as a talent scout are numbered, my friend. She'll be great. You look good up there. The first day is always the toughest. Bonnie, I'd like you to meet John Beaudet. Super cop, a legend in his own mind. - Hi, good to meet you. - It's a pleasure. What's a nice girl like you doing hanging out with a bum like this? Learning, a lot. Well, you came to the right guy if you like the mature veteran type. I'll be seeing you around. Jee, that guy seems to be his own best friend, huh? John's OK. You'd do well to end up with a partner like him. Well, this is what you wanted, kid, official academy training. I'm feeding you to Lebell for real this time. You're on your own this time. Come on, take it like a man. Right, like a man. [grunting] Two, step forward. Three, pop to the groin. Fourth, knee the groin. Step back. Draw your weapon. Hands up! Get down on your knees! [grunting] ACADEMY TEACHER: Remember the cycle of violence is remorseful stage into the tension stage into the acute battering stage and then back into the remorseful stage. You've got the cycle and it's a continuous cycle, going on and on and on. OK, any other questions? ACADEMY STUDENT: Yeah. Why would a woman stay in a relationship where she's battered? [grunting] Oh, there you go. Beat yourself up. Let's do it again. Nah, give it a rest. I want to do it again, Lebell, please. OK. [grunting] Ow, Jesus. God, I can't believe how out of shape I'm in. I'm starting to make me feel guilty again. You ready for chapter two Wonder Woman? Yeah, let's do it. OK. Arrest procedures, auto. Call in location or stop and check license plate before leaving police unit. Instruct driver to place his hands on the steering wheel. Approach driver side window with caution, leaving firearm free at all times. Check back seat for other passengers or suspicious items. Note driver's features, eyes, hair, weight. Request driver's license and registration. Excuse me, Sergeant. - Go ahead. Hypothetically asking, if a woman was in a domestic relationship and she had been beaten several times, and what really drew the line was her being completely battered and in the hospital. Her husband threatened her-- threatened to kill her. Would he actually-- actually do it and proceed in his threat? Absolutely. Remember the lethality checklist we talked about. Remember one of them was the threats to the victim, threats to the children, the family members, even to the pet, also the fantasies of the threats. Absolutely. If this person is in jail, I guarantee you that if this person gets out, he's going to try to complete the threat. It's the same if he's running around loose right now, I guarantee you he will try to complete that threat and kill her. [gun shots] That's pretty good, kid. Where have been shooting? I haven't shot before, sir. Just thought about it a lot. Hey, well, you're a natural. You keep that up and you'll have no problems at all. Let's try it again. [screaming] [grunting] Hey. Hey. Great day for a run. What are you doing here? Well, I like to keep up with my exercise. You know, I get a little soft riding around in a unit all the time. I can imagine. You're looking pretty tough. I hear you're doing well. Just doing the best I can. Ah, but is it good enough? Want to race? First one to the end buys dinner. You'll never do it, kiddo. OK. Try me, tough guy. Come on, Blackwell. Oh, Blackwell, you look like you're breathing hard. Come on, girl. [heavy breathing] [laughter] I told you. I don't believe it. Well, I guess that means I owe you dinner. It's OK. I've got to watch my figure. But you can eat your words. Bon appetit, tough guy. 91, 92. I think you're crazy. Crazy? 5. When are you done dealing with Officer Hunk? In no time. Stand on your bologna. You're scared. 99. 100. When did you become a shrink? Don't need to be a doctor to see an open wound. Listen, Jackie, I've got to take things slow. I just had forgotten how to be with-- Men. No, anyone. Do you understand? Dear God, I'm hugging a cop. I need dinner. Beaudet and Blackwell, you're up next. John, wait a minute, wait a minute. Go back there. Go back there. John. Yes, sir. What are you doing? Sir? Who told you to come out here dressed like that? Where'd you get those yellow socks? Sir. If we wanted a clown, we'd go to the circus to get a clown. We don't want those socks. You wear the regulation socks, you understand me? Yes, sir. Well, you get your butt out of the academy. This is not a college campus. - Yes, sir. Now, get out of here. Beaudet, Blackwell, you're up. All right, Blackwell, any time you're ready. Yes, sir. Put your hands up in the air slowly. Get down on your knees. Get down on your stomach. Bury your forehead. Spread your arms out to the side with your palms up. [grunting] [gun shots] Hey. - How you doing? Pretty good. If you keep hanging out with us rookies, people are going to start wondering about you. [chuckles] So, how are those tired, sore muscles of yours? I mean, you're starting to get pretty cocky, young lady. If I remember right, I still owe you a dinner. Yeah. Well, it's night time. You busy? You know, I'm still thinking you lead a double life. And as a matter of fact, I never have seen you with that man together. [laughter] Oh, you're a funny guy. No, it's just that I really have to stay focused. I really need this. I want it really bad. OK, I understand. Well, I'm not going to quit trying. Neither will I. Graduates, these past seven months have been the toughest in your lives, but I would hasten to add, the proudest. Your training has been the best in the world. And as the newest members of the Los Angeles Police Department, you're about to become members of the finest law enforcement team in the world. Your mission is to protect and to serve, and we're all very proud of you. Class of 195, please come forward for your diplomas. [applause] Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. It is now my great honor to present the outstanding recruit award to Ms. Bonnie Blackwell. Ms. Blackwell, please come forward. [applause] This award represents the highest achievement in recruit training. Congratulations, Officer Blackwell. Thank you, sir. [applause] Class of 1995, you represent the finest that this city has to offer. And we know that you will conduct yourself professionally with respect and a dedication to service, and a pride in what you've become. Welcome to the LAPD. [applause] Class of 195, dismissed. To Officer Bonnie Blackwell, a great cop, an outstanding woman, and my new partner. What's that? You mean he didn't tell you? No, he didn't. Well, I figured the first in her class really ought to learn from the best. I'm just doing my civic duty. Mmm mm mm, girl, after tonight, blue is my favorite color. Woo, sure glad Dwayne has to work late tonight. You be a good girl now. Oh, come on, you know I'm all talk. I'll let you go celebrate. She is so crazy. Oh, before I forget. I got you a little something for graduation. Oh, you shouldn't have. You know, I still have that little tiger you gave me back in the hospital. Oh my God, that's so beautiful. Oh, wow, this is really-- thank you so much. Here's a little something to go with it. You did good, for a girl. You are such a tough guy. [telephone ringing] Allow me to introduce you to the real police work. Go get them. You know, it's been a week now, John, and all I seem to do is fill out reports, is that because I'm new? It's because you're a cop. They haven't even busted any bad guys. I mean, real bad guys. [police radio chatter] How does anything get done around here? Well, you just grin and bear it. Let's get it. Fuck, man. Let's get out of here. Come on. Get a 2151 in pursuit of the 503, a black Buick. License plate number 1ML760. [police sirens] Headed East down 6 towards Mill. Any backup units stand by. [tires screeching] [crashing] [gun fire] [explosion] I got him. Stop all your actions now! Put your hands up in the air. I said, put your hands up in the air, now! [gasping] What the fuck am I running from you for? Bitch. [screams] Fucking bitch. Fuck you. I'm sorry. You all right? I'm sorry. Radio in that one got away, heading north on Hewitt. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Bonnie, do you have the Jackson file? Blackwell, in my office. Yes, sir. Doctor says you're OK. I'm fine. What the hell happened out there? I don't know, sir. I can't explain it. You better be able to explain it, cause you got a partner out there who's worried about you. I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again. He's not worried about how you feel. He's worried about how reliable you are. He's afraid for himself, even though he won't admit it. And I'm worried too, because I can't have you choking out there again. It won't happen again, sir. I'm putting you on desk duty for a while. John will get another partner. Just temporarily. OK, sir. [background music playing] Hey, Blackwell, heard about what happened today. Rough day. Yeah, rough day. Look, I know why you choked out there. Even if the rest of these bozos don't understand, I know where you've been. So I can't totally blame you for what happened. But understand something, to these guys, women on the force is some kind of charity program. They jump all over stuff like that, especially when it's one of the best that screws up. Is that supposed to take the pressure off? No, it's supposed to put it on, whether you like it or not, whether it's fair or not. You are something here, and if you fail we all fail. And I have worked too hard for that. Everybody's got a past, something that gets in the way. So what do you suggest? Get over it. I took the liberty of ordering. I got this sneaking suspicion that you're walking around with the idea that that guy in the alley somehow beat you. He got away. He could have killed me. But he didn't defeat you. You saw him come at you and you turned back into that fright lady I first met a year and a half ago. You're dredged up, right out of the old storage closet, and put around like an old suit. That's not you anymore. You're another person. I'm not so sure about that. Bill, it was like Zach all over again. I was paralyzed. Then you have to take control and not simply respond to what they do. You call the shots. I'll tell you the truth, that bloody nose did you more good than you know. No rookie is worth his salt unless he's tasted a little pain. But he realizes that life goes on and the job is still there. Bill, I've tasted plenty of pain. As a victim, not as a cop. You don't just take it anymore, you use it. Let it make you mad. They should stick it out, I mean, that I didn't make a mistake doing this. You quit on me now and I'll personally take you over my knee, and don't think I couldn't, young lady. I don't know what I'd do without you. You're a real touchstone for me. Oh, don't let it get out. Pretty soon everyone will expect me to buy them a drink. [chuckles] Can't do that. Hey, baby. Oh, Bonnie, I've missed you. So glad you decided to come see me. Honey. I need to talk to you. It's a funny thing, Zach. I need to talk to you too. Wait a minute. Baby, let me say something. I forgive you. I forgive you for putting me in here. All right. No, no. I'm a different man. I'm a changed man. I've had time to think about how wrong I was to treat you that way. And I've had a lot of time to think too. Zach, I-- I-- Go on. Go on. I filed for a divorce. A what? You filed a what? I hear you correctly? A divorce? What are you going to do? Huh? How are you going to live? You, you could never take care of yourself. You-- Honey, I'm sorry. Wait. I didn't mean that. No no no wait, wait, wait a minute. I guess, I'm just a little upset, you know, with the news. Just forget everything I just said, OK? Baby. I'm looking at you here. I see you. You're looking so fine. You're so pretty. I want you, baby. I want to be with you. I was thinking later maybe we could, you know-- Look, I just can't take the pain anymore. My life has been shattered and I'm just beginning to pick up the pieces. I'm living a different life now, Zach. And I feel good about myself now. What is this new life? What do you mean, lead a new life? Well, that's fine. You didn't think you had a good life? Huh? The clothes? The food? A roof over your head? Huh? And a man. Yeah, me. I provided well for you, Bonnie. I'm not good enough for you now, huh? Is that it? You think you can run from me? Huh, Bonnie? Zach. God, you haven't changed a bit. I thought I loved you, but how could anybody love a person like you. Goodbye, Zach. Wait a minute, I'm not finished talking to you. Hey! You think you can run from me? Huh, Bonnie? You think you can run-- all right, all right. OK. [grunting] Come on. You're dead. You're finished. You'll shove off to Buffalo, and you know why? Because your heart ain't in it. You think you're going to beat those guys just using technique? Those guys are fighting for their lives. Is that what you want? You got to fight for your life. Get my drift? I think I got the hint. You sure you want to do this. It's going to take a lot of extra work. Yeah, the regular training just isn't enough. I mean, I really need to go way beyond that. I want to be able to kick any butt on the force. Oh, you want to be respected. No. I want to be feared. You want to be feared. Yeah. I don't think so. You just might be wasting your time. [grunting] What do you say now, Lebell? Wednesday, my time? Huh? OK OK OK. OK OK. We could do it. You got it. Besides, I think I like you better on top. [grunting] [telephone ringing] Hey, partner. This desk ain't big enough for the both of us. What you say we ride the range and head off a few bad guys at the pass? You mean, I'm back on the streets? That's what the captain says. What do you say? Well, I say that everybody deserves a second chance, especially the best. Besides, this new rookie they stuck with me is a goddamn nightmare. He packs limburger cheese sandwiches, he bites his fingernails, and all he can do is talk about reruns of the Honeymooners. You know what his life's dream is? What? To own the first oceanfront trailer court. [laughter] You've got to save me from this guy. OK, I'll come to your rescue. I owe you that at least. Well, you also owe me dinner. How about after we knock off? Deal. But this time, dinner's on me, OK. OK. OFFICER [ON RADIO]: Come in 825, code 6. 105 North Avenue 52. [screaming] I'll take the runner. [thud] [gun shot] [grunting] [gun shots] Give me your left hand now! Hands behind your back. So your 10 partner wants a trailer court. Yeah. What's your dream? My dream-- I want to be Andy of Mayberry. - Excuse me. Yeah, I want to be the Sheriff of a small town. You know, big fish in a small pond, master of all I survey, even if it is a two meal town. So does that mean you want a bunch of little Opies? Well, it depends. I have to find someone other than Aunt Bee. How about you? Oh, I don't know. I kind of like animals. Maybe I'd like to raise some dogs and cats and bunny rabbits somewhere. So what are we doing in the Big Bad City? Fighting for truth, justice, and the American way. Yeah, I'll drink to that. See that W up there? Yeah. That's Cassiopeia, the mother of Andromeda. Wow. And what's that zig zag one over there? That zig zag, that's Aetna, she's the goddess of life insurance. Boy, those Romans thought of everything. Did they have cops back then? Well, they had gladiators. You know, leather sandals and light mini skirts. Oh, yeah. They had the right idea. Yeah, yeah. They sure couldn't dance like this though. I'm going to dip you. OK. Want to come in for a minute? Yeah. Let me just lock up. I'll be right in. Great. That's perfect. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. - Come on in. - Thanks. It's really starting to come down out there. Yeah. It's nice and warm in here. Yeah. Would you like some wine? I would love some wine. Should I pour it? OK. All right. That was a great dinner. Here you go. Thank you. So what are you thinking? Just trying to think of some clever original way of saying the most obvious thing in the world. What's that? That you're beautiful. I like hanging out with you. And I know falling for your partner is against every common sense idea I ever had, and I don't care. I wonder why I don't care. [telephone ringing] Hello. Hi, Jackie. No, that's not actually the case. Thanks, Jackie. Thanks for your advice. Bye. Jackie, good friend with the best intentions. Well, that makes two of us. What is it? Is it me? Is it that bust we had the other day? No, it's nothing like that. I-- Sorry. I just thought-- I don't know what I thought-- I'll tell you what, I had a great time tonight. Why don't we just call it a night. Leave it at that. Go to sleep happy, OK? OK. All right. It's too bad though, I found this really great parking space. Bye. [police sirens] MAN: You say nothing! Nothing! [beating] [woman crying] BONNIE BLACKWELL: Open up. It's the police. JOHN BEAUDET: Open the door, it's the police. What is this? You tell me. What's the problem here? No problem here, except you're in my house. Nobody called you. Oh my God. What's he been doing to you, ma'am? You shut up! You don't say nothing. You shut up. You should take it easy. Folks, clear out. Thank you very much. It's nothing, officer. It was my fault. John, let me talk to her for a second. Bonnie. Look, just a second in the other room. She don't got to say nothing! [yelling] I don't want to cause no trouble. It's OK, ma'am. He has no right to hit you. Do you work? Part time at the job care center. And what about him? No. He hasn't worked in two years, except for poker money. He don't even try anymore. It's just-- he's so stressed out about-- That means you're not depending on him to live, right? So you can file a complaint and completely put a stop to all of this. No, I couldn't. That would make him mad. He's already mad. You see this? My husband did that to me with the steering wheel of my own car. And if I didn't put a stop to it I would have had a hell of a lot more than these. And I would have been in the same situation that you're in now, or dead. Listen, I can't tell you what to do, but as scary as it is to put a stop to it, it's not half as scary as it is living with it. With the steering wheel of your own car? We ain't married. We're just living together. You should show me what to do. Yes, I can. John, she's going to file a complaint. And you are under arrest. I ain't arrested for shit! You just shut up! John, your turn to take out the trash. It's a pleasure. Don't worry about anything, ma'am. I'll show you all the necessary arrangements. So what do you want to do tonight? Oh, am I tired. Yeah, well, yeah. Would you like to do something? - How about seeing a movie? - You want to see a movie? Yeah. Let's get a paper and see what's playing, so we can go to movies. - Well, why do we do that? - You want to do that, OK? [laughter] Come on, hurry. Give me the money. Come on, let's go. John, got a robbery in progress. Call for back up. Come on with the money, bitch. Put the gun down now! [screaming] Drop the gun! I said, drop it! Drop the gun! Leave the gun! WOMAN 3: Help me! That would be your shot, Beaudet! Cover me. [gun fire] [scream] CAPTAIN: Blackwell, on behalf of the department, we'd like to give you this metal of commendation for a job well done. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. [applause] You just keep outdoing yourself. I really owe it all to you, Bill. Thank you. No, thank you. This is it. Wow, great place. Can I take your coat? Yeah. Let's hang it up. That's what I always do, too. It feels good. To the blue. To the blue. Another bad guy bites the dust at the hands of the karate cop. You were magnificent. Thank you. Bonnie. I'm sorry. I guess I still tend to flinch when anybody touches me. I just need to learn to trust again. I hate it as much as you do, John. You think I can hurt you? I know it doesn't make sense. What are you doing? Creating an atmosphere of trust. Here, cuff me. Cuff me. Now, there's nothing to be afraid of. I'd like a sip of champagne, please. Oh. Now, look at the mess you've made. I'm so glad you invited me here. I'm so glad you came. Nice day. Darn near perfect, I'd say. My wrists hurt. Oh, I thought you were a tough guy. Nah, that's just good public relations. Can't have too much of that these days. Remind me to complement your agent, huh? MAN 2: Please don't take her-- don't take her back. You've got to leave her here. Please, don't-- don't take her back. I need her. I really-- please, please don't take her. I have the money. I have the money. I just have to sell some-- [gun shot] Oh, please, help! OFFICER [ON RADIO]: We have a 209 in progress. Units in Montgomery, officer down. Approach the premises. All the units, respond. This is 2151 responding, ETA, 4 minutes. 2151 out. [police sirens] My God! You're alive. The guy had a gun. He wanted money. When the cop came he just shot him and then he ran. I thought he was going to kill my-- my daughter and me. I didn't know what he was going to do. [whimpering] According to this Hummel guy, it was a simple break-in. We haven't found any signs of forced entry. Hummel says he was having lunch with his Korean stepdaughter when this guy broke, demanded money, almost as he didn't have any, but the guy claimed he was loaded, which he is. So he calls his broker to cash out some stocks, bring the money over. Actually, he called the police. Starr and Riley responded, but they didn't know it was an armed robbery, because Hummel didn't tell them. Riley got knocked out the second she came through the door. Starr was on his own when he drew his gun, but it was too late. Want me to come in and fix you dinner? No, I-- I really need some time alone. That's fair enough. I'll see you in the morning. [engine starts] Oh, Bill, thank you for coming into my life when you did. God, please, rest his soul. Hummel says he can't remember much about the shooter. He was kind of drunk at the time and the killer wore a mask. Can you believe that? A mask. So what are we going to do about it. No fingerprints, Hummel has a bullshit story, and his lawyer is being a son of a bitch when it comes to cooperating. I think he's hiding something. But there's nothing we can do but keep a sharp eye. It's going to take time. I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Do you mind if I take an early lunch. You OK? I'm fine. OK. Open up. Police department. Oh, Jesus. Quick, put that on. Hurry up. God damn it. What do you want? I answered questions for you guys the other day. I need to ask you some questions about the guy that just broken in. The hell is going on here? It's nothing-- it's nothing, ma'am. Nothing, officer. Nothing. Nothing? This girl was your adopted daughter. No. No. No, it's what-- it's not that really-- it's not that-- It's not what, sir? Talk. Talk. She's-- she's not my daughter. She's my wife. I got her through the service overseas. They fix up girls who want to come to the states with guys like me. I got money. I'm not much of a hit with women, and so I-- Is that true? What's your name? Quanjiet. I thought you said she was Korean, this sounds Vietnamese. Does it make any difference? Is she legal? No, please. Couldn't we keep this quiet? If it got out, I could never face anybody. Does she have anything to do with the person who tried to break in? He's not a thief. He's the guy that brought her. He runs the service. I paid him. Everything was fine for about a year and a half. And then, all of a sudden, he shows up and he wants more money, he said he'd turn us into immigration. I don't have any money around the house. He said he'd turn us in, so I said I'd call my broker and sell some stock, and instead I called the cops. Please, I want to stay. Listen, you tell me everything you know about this guy. And I mean, the truth. and I'll do what I can to see you guys stay together. And that's all I can promise. [telephone ringing] Well, where'd you take the unit? Just a little independent research. I'll tell you later. OK. You look tired. You want me to take you home? Yeah, if you would. Yeah, let's go. [telephone ringing] [telephone ringing] Hello. Oh, hi, Jackie. Yeah, pretty good. I guess. Just a little tired. I don't seem to get over Bill's death. Well, it just seems to go around and around in my head. Thank you. I appreciate it. You're the best. All right. Bye. [gun shot] [grunting] I'll kill you. I'll kill you, you bitch. I should of been there for you. It's OK. It's not much you could have done. What the hell is he doing out anyway? He had another six months to go. Well, I checked with the prisons. He was with parole two weeks ago. Out on good behavior. We checked the room we was digging around and I found this in the safe behind the bookshelf. You sure you had no idea he had a safe in the house? No. Not at all. I knew it was just a storage closet. I never cleaned it out. What is this? Best that I can tell, your husband was creating fake IDs for these girls. These are immigration documents. They're probably fake like the rest of this stuff. So this was sitting around the whole time he was in jail. Probably just wanted to steal it back before you found it. But what was he going to do with all of it. That's what we have to find out. We've had an opportunity to review all your records. You have been an exemplary person. We are very happy with your growth and development. The psychologist feel very confident about your evolution, but you must appreciate that we have a legitimate concern regarding the general public. We want it to be a comfortable fit for them, and yet for you also. Do you feel that your incarceration has had any impact on your thinking about your role in society, about respect for law and order? How dare you. How dare you not tell me he was released. He had another six months to go, and you didn't even call me to the hearing. Ma'am, what are you talking about? I'm talking about Zachary Blackwell. My husband. He was sentenced for two years, and you released him early. And you didn't even think it was important enough to call me? Who the hell's rights are you protecting here? Maybe I should leave you folks alone. Annie, you stay put. Officer, we complied with all the relevant regulations. We felt that it was-- - Bullshit. You felt nothing. And you acted like God damn robots who know nothing about him or me or the women out there who have to face this scum when you let him go. God damn you! Yeah, go on, girl. You tell them like it is. Yeah, you're a real man. [telephone ringing] Hey, how was your lunch? Wonderful. What do you got? Well, they ran a check on those passports. As expected, they're homemade. The girls are not citizens, they're Vietnamese. Mail order brides. We tracked them down to the home of some wealthy bachelors. The INS has been after this guy for years. Mail order brides? Zach was into mail order brides? Yeah, apparently. But we got a special problem. Right? We don't have trade relations with Vietnam, so anything coming through them is illegal. Bingo. [keys clacking] Where you going? I've got some papers to sign for the course. You lost? [grunting] You kill a cop and it's all over for you. Who's going to ID me? You think they'd find witnesses here? I own these streets. What do you want? I'm looking for these girls. Do you know any of them? Maybe. What do you want with them? They're here illegally. And who isn't? What do you care? You're not immigration. I'm not looking for them. I want the guy who brought them here. So do we. You? Why? Because he a slave trader. What? He pays Thai boatmen to kidnap runaways in Saigon, Di Linh, Cao Lanh. Smuggle them here. Sell my people to rich white bastards. We know him. Been in jail. Safest place for him. His name is Blackwell. Who the fuck are you? I'm his wife. And I put him in jail once and I'm going to do it again. The wife wants to put him in jail. This man sure knows how to make friends. You know how to fight. I respect that I don't know where he is, but the Manta Ray is in that picture. Comes in the first of the month, Dock 51. You find him. We cut his dick off like a good wife. Officer Beaudet, please. Hi, John. It's Bonnie. Listen, call the Coast Guard registry and look up the Manta Ray. Zach tried to break in to still the blank IDs because he's bringing another shipment of girls. Yeah. Listen, we have to nail him. We have to find that boat. If the gang leader was right, they'll be heading in sometime tonight. OK. Bye. So how do you want to do it? Well, back-up's on the way. We've got to move in on them. Catch them in the act. Listen, this time, you take the front and I'll take the back. But promise me one thing, show up this time. Promise. [rattling] MAN: Just be patient ZACH BLACKWELL: Come on, smile. Girls, you're in America now. Come on, be happy. [laughter] Say, will you take those girls upstairs? Hold them upstairs until the-- come on, girls, smile. What's the matter with these girls? They need to relax. We're happy! Can you say sensation mister, sensation mister? You're in America now. Come on. God, you're so nervous. I don't know what's the matter with you. Relax. Can I get you another girl? I don't know why it's late. [thud] [gun fire] Get out! Stop her. Why do you think I paid you? [gun fire] Zach. [thud] [grunting] Goodnight, lover boy. Go get her! Go get her! [helicopter flying] [grunting] [gun shots] Put the gun down, Zach. I said put the gun down! Sweetheart, didn't I tell you? Never bother me at the office! Anyway, so nice to see you. What is this? What is this new wardrobe? Ah? Tell me, Bonnie, does it make you feel more like a man? Huh? What is this new career? I think I like the old Bonnie. You see, every man needs an outlet for his anxieties. Why? Because you took it-- You took it so well. [laughter] Wife. [grunting] Don't shoot. Take the money! You can have the money! [screaming] Congratulations, Zach. You turned out to be the worst piece of shit than I ever expected. But I forgive you now, husband. [music playing]
