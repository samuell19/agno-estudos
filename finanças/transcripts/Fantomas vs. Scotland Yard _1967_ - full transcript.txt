FANTOMAS AGAINST SCOTLAND YARD Sir Walter Brown, pleased to meet you, I'm André Berthier. I'm Lord MacRashley's secretary. Dear Walter, Edward's waiting for you. Come in! Dear Walter, I'm so glad to see you. Come in and take off your coat. This brings back such memories! Remember Oxford? It seems like yesterday. But time goes by. I didn't realize it until my secretary reminded me. Wonderful boy! Serious, tidy, organized... and loyal. In a moment, your husband will finally have life insurance. The payment will be immediately made to you with no formalities. In case of... Poor darling! May God keep him. As soon as possible. Let's get straight to the purpose of your visit: the life insurance policy you sent me. I read all the clauses carefully. They seem clear and reasonable. Except Clause 6, for which I need your advice. It covers, in all circumstances and countries except China, all risks of natural or accidental death... but doesn't cover suicide, which is excluded... This is no time to play cowboys and Indians. Let's get back to serious matters. I want this clause to explicitly cover the risk of murder... Come now, Walter. Aren't we a bit old for these kinds of jokes? Lord MacRashley... Are you implying that Fantomas is a joker? Fantomas! Don't worry, I didn't come here to murder you. Thanks... Or at least not right away. It'll depend on you. You're the third-richest man in the world. Not quite. I hate false modesty and hypocrites. I'm very proud to be the world's top criminal. In order to get close to you, I took on the identity of your friend, Walter Brown. This face is a mask. But the mask is so perfect that you were taken in. Speaking of which... Let me refresh your memory. Two years ago, in the guise of Fandor the journalist, I took off into the sky with a fortune in jewels. Here I'm pulling a holdup in the guise of Commissioner Juve. Here I'm foiling my adversaries once again in my pocket submarine. Here's my secret laboratory. I'm developing the means to destroy this planet when I decide to move to another one. But I won't be taking off in a flying car. That was last year's gadget. But I don't intend to liquidate this planet just yet. It's the goose with the golden eggs. I've decided to make humanity pay. How? I've borrowed the hackneyed old populist slogan: Make the rich pay! I'll make them pay a tax for the right to live. What? Don't I have power over your life? - Well... - Might as well. Yeah... I've set up a system for direct taxation. It's a collection department to levy a tax on the most well-off for the right to live. I drew up a statement on your behalf, just sign it. Naturally I'll allow payment plans. I could tax you over 2 years, 1 year or 6 months. Except taxation by 6-month installments could get tedious. And it would cost you a fortune... Given your good health and rosy financial situation, the best and most economical is definitely the flat rate. The flat rate? 3 billion francs or $6 million. And you'll never hear from Fantomas again. That's a fortune! With the cost of living today, it's nothing. And I'll give you a month. As you see, any sum not paid by the deadline will automatically have a 10% surcharge added. - That would be $6,600,000! - Before taxes. If you allow the second 1-month deadline to pass, I'll send you one more warning before I execute you. - Execute me? - Yes. If you mention our contract to anyone, your execution will be immediate. You'll receive a registered letter with a receipt setting out the modalities and place of payment. What's that? They're here to pick me up on your terrace. If you want to use my gadget, the Movie Box, the instructions are inside. Don't bother seeing me out. Good-bye, my Lord, see you soon! Walter! Darling, I can't decide which one for Page 3. Not again! Haven't you had enough of Fantomas? It's obvious he killed Walter Brown. There's no proof, besides I don't like the headline: "Fantomas in Scotland." Once a year, like a sea monster. Thanks, I have my next article. "The Loch Ness Monster is actually Fantomas." You need a change of scene. I'll get you airline tickets. Maybe it'll give you better ideas. COMMISSIONER JUVE ...that Fantomas was to blame. You and your assistant are invited. I actually speak very good French. I studied in Paris. Congratulations. In the meantime, don't do anything silly. You'll be in no danger with me there. Don't tell a soul. I'll travel incognito. This time, he won't get away. See you tomorrow. Delighted to hear your voice. Me too, who's this? I look forward to spending time with you in Scotland. Me too, who are you? Fantomas. Have a good trip, and see you soon. - Who is it? - Fantomas. - Fantomas? - Ever heard of him? Don't you remember? Gentlemen, I've called this secret meeting because we hold the largest fortunes in the world. Fantomas has levied a tax on us for the right to live at an exorbitant rate. The Maharajah of Kinpoura requests the floor. Go ahead. His Excellency says he's the worst victim of Fantomas. Every year, he has to pay him his weight in diamonds. I can give the Maharajah of Kinpoura the name of a masseur who can make him lose 50 kg before the end of the year. Richard, we always appreciate your sense of humor, but today's situation is no laughing matter. You seem to forget that our friend Walter Brown was murdered by the monster and we all risk the same fate. The Maharajah of Kinpoura has our sympathy. The Maharajah gratefully quotes Rabindranath Tagore: "Lightning strikes, but the rain makes the cherry tree bloom." Very nice... Thank you, Excellency. We've all been forced to sign this statement. - I received a court order. - So did I. But if even Hitler couldn't scare me, Fantomas certainly won't! It's not fear that kills you. - Please excuse me. - As you wish. But you're taking a great risk. Maybe. Have fun! Here's what we'll do: We'll trap Fantomas. The trap will be my chateau. Commissioner Juve, who's in charge of the case, and Fandor, the journalist, and his fiancée will be there. They'll be the bait in the trap. Fantomas will certainly show up sooner or later, they're his sworn enemies. That's when we pounce on our prey. Flowers! How thoughtful! - Commissioner Juve? - Yes. André Berthier, Lord MacRashley's secretary. Is that Loch Ness? We'll be there soon. Does Lord MacRashley remember what happened? No, he had a drink with his friend, Walter Brown, then his memory's blank. They drugged his drink. Maybe it was just the shock. You do your job, I'll do mine. To avoid getting stuck in the fog, I'll go through the woods. It's a bit narrow, but we'll get to the chateau faster. The locals don't like this road much. They call it Three Hanged Men Road. Why Three Hanged Men? They claim that 3 men traveling on this road were found hanging in the forest the next day. - At least we're 5. - It's just a legend! Watch out! Hang on... Ready? - It's impossible! - Too heavy! - Why don't we go this way? - We'll get stuck. Come look! This tree was cut! - It can't be! - We were attacked! Look at the stump! We were attacked! - Who could have done this? - Good start... Look over there! What's happening? It's Godfrey. Hello, Godfrey. Drive us to the chateau. A tree's blocking the road. Can you get through with your car? Back up a little, we'll help you. Turn the wheel. Straighten up. Go forward. - A bit more. - Push! I think we can get on now. We're getting on? Drive, Godfrey. Sitting all alone, Élisabeth? - Let me get you a scotch. - Thanks. May I keep you company? The colonel has some funny stories about the Indian War. Superintendent Tom Smith, who's running the investigation. Please feel free to ask for a bridge table. - They're laughing at us. - Who? - All of them! - I don't see why. Look down! You won't catch me in a skirt. Scottish evening wear is the kilt. No, it's the tuxedo. It says black and white in my international style guide. Tuxedos are black and white. Leave me alone. The world is unknown and mysterious. Good and evil are engaged in eternal combat. - Good and evil? - Yes, Commissioner. I believe Fantomas comes from another world. Another world? You seriously think Fantomas is a Martian? A Martian! The French are so down to earth. No, I'm talking about the beyond. You don't believe in evil spirits? I dunno... We're surrounded by invisible presences that could appear at any moment and decide our life and death. - Our death? - Dorothy's right. We're surrounded by too many mysterious things. You seem interested in the subject. I did a piece on a haunted house. It was thrilling. Unfortunately, all my pictures were fogged. By ghosts. That's why you can't photograph them. - I assume you're a believer? - Of course. - Is your chateau haunted? - Obviously. Do you believe in ghosts? Journalists always keep an open mind. I'll wait and see. You'll see. Albert! - Bring us a card table. - For 4? - No, for 7. - Yes. What for? I think Lady MacRashley's suggesting a séance. A séance? That's silly! With eyes like yours, you'd be a fantastic medium. You have fantastic eyes too. Aren't they fascinating? I agree with you. - The table's ready. - Thank you. Shall we begin? Come along. I'd follow you to the underworld. - Feel it already? - Yes... It's a good sign, I knew it. Come closer, Mr. Juve. We'll question Walter. Walter? Walter Brown, Fantomas's victim. I didn't come here to question ghosts. - Neither did I. - Shut up! But Walter knows who killed him. He could tell you. Here's something the French police have never tried! Interrogate the dead victims instead of the suspects. Isn't it worth a try? I know what'll happen. I'll suddenly see a flash, then my picture's on Page 1 tomorrow with the headline: "For lack of suspects, Juve interrogates ghosts." You can see I don't have my camera. I won't allow a ghost to lead the investigation. - Dear colleague... - Yes? I'm the representative of the British police, may I interrupt? Dear colleague, I realize French methods are outdated, that our police are too manic, that you have the secret of the stiff upper lip, but I didn't think Scotland Yard levitated tables. Easier to make a table talk than a suspect. Exactly. There's no danger. In Great Britain, ghosts and policemen are never armed. Are you making fun? - It's ridiculous! - For a lovely Lady, courtly ridicule never killed a Frenchman. Don't be a spoilsport. Please take your places. Élisabeth, sit across from me, next to the Emir of Kolowatt. He has intense powers. Hold your hands above the table, fingers spread. Your hands must lightly touch your neighbors' little fingers. Concentrate. Don't be nervous. Bring your hand closer. Your little finger... Don't worry, it's nothing. The transformer got struck by lightning again. No, it's a sign from beyond. A favorable sign. Concentrate. Walter's letting us know he's coming. I feel Walter's about to show himself. Walter, are you there? Dear Walter, where is your murderer? Who is Fantomas? What's wrong, Walter? Are you there? Is there a disbeliever among us? There's a disbeliever among us. Is he to my left? He's not to my left. To my right? Commissioner, you're a disbeliever! He won't show because of you! In that case, allow me to... Oh dear! Swine! - Excuse me. - Walter? No, Albert, I'm your butler for your stay here. May I show you to your room? I'll light the way. - Tell me, Walter... - Albert. - Do they do that often? - What, sir? - Their séances. - Almost every night. Last week, my Lady spoke with the Duke of Wellington. Is she... Pardon me? Doesn't get it. This way? Be careful, it's the original staircase and it's narrow. How about that! The chateau's full of stirring memories. Since the Crusades, many strange things have happened here. - Fantastical and terrifying... - How about that! These old stones talk of the past. Look! - That's Murdoch. - Murdoch? - Sir Murdoch MacRashley. - Why's he dressed as a ghost? Sir Murdoch MacRashley died in the Third Crusade beneath the walls of Saint Jean d'Acre. - He's making fun. - No, sir. Watch your step, sir. - Where? - Back there. Allow me to offer you a compliment, sir. - Go right ahead. - You look good in a kilt. I've been meaning to ask you, do you always wear them? Of course. In the evening, everyone must wear a kilt. - My assistant was wrong. - Absolutely. But tradition's dying, they've taken to wearing pants now. Thank you, I won't get lost from here. I'll find my room myself. It's the door at the end of the hall. LAST WARNING BEFORE EXECUTION Sound the alarm! There's a hanged man in my room! What? How awful! There's a hanged man in my room! - My room? - No, mine. - Mine, how awful! - Moron! There's a hanged man in my room! You wretch! You scared Walter away! Never mind, there's a hanged man in my room! Come see! Hurry! It's terrifying! It's horrible! - Watch your step. - Where? Back there. - Thanks, Commissioner. - Come on! The hanged man! Is this a joke? They unhung him! Unbelievable! - What's going on? - He didn't unhang himself! You have to find him! I'm not leaving till someone finds him! Did you lose something, sir? My hanged man! You have to find him! I assure you I didn't put away any hanged men. He's still making fun. No, besides, I never do housework after 10 p.m. No one here seems to believe me! I believe you. Of course you found a hanged man in your room. At least you believe me. Yes, but now he's gone. Yes, I know, but why? He was a ghost. Get it through your head I don't believe in ghosts. The ghost I hanged... The host I... Never mind! The ghost I saw was one of Fantomas's men dressed up. Any ghost caught in the chateau will be immediately arrested. A French policeman handcuffing a Scottish ghost? What next? Ghost or no ghost, we'd all like to believe you. Just give us more details. That's it! I remember, he had on a light raincoat with a pink form like from the tax department pinned to it. It said, "Last warning before execution." A pink form? Yes! Right here! "Last warning before execution"? Must be Richard. Turn right to get to the river port. Gentlemen... I've called you to this offshore location in the middle of the night because we're safer here than elsewhere from police interference. Thank you for answering my call so quickly. As you know, we have a very important decision to make. When Giuseppe gets here, we can work out the details. He's here. Hello, Giuseppe. We've been expecting you. Please sit down. Gentlemen, take your seats. We have an amazing deal to offer you. I'm sure you'll agree to it. Our devoted friend and informer, André Berthier, Lord MacRashley's secretary, has told us of Fantomas's latest scheme. He's taxing the richest men in the world for the right to live. Should've thought of it. What a great racket! - And easy to run. - What do you think? Good idea, right? We've decided to use the idea for our own gain. Our plan is simple. We capture Fantomas when he turns up at the chateau. We kill him and hide the body so the police think he's alive. We pretend we're him and keep all the profits of Operation Right to Live. We've planned everything. Not everything. Not quite. Because Fantomas... is me. Don't move! Since you're all aware of how the operation works, we'll save lots of time. Here are your contracts. They're drawn up in your names. Not us! What's the point of being a gangster? With the risks entailed? In this society, crooks and rich people are the same. In any self-respecting society, everyone has to pay their taxes. Good night, gentlemen. Open the door! It's locked! Break it down! He killed Giuseppe! Now we'll take care of Lord MacRashley. I can't take this! - Commissioner... - Yes? Even in a haunted house, this isn't the best disguise. - You don't get it. - No? We're not in disguise, idiot. - There are ghosts here. - Real ones? Fake, real ones don't exist. That ghost I saw was a fake ghost. We have to provoke the fake ghosts. What happens when one fake ghost runs into another? - He's scared? - He thinks you're one of them. So he gets closer and closer... He doesn't know it's you, you slap the cuffs on. Go do your rounds in the east wing. Don't trip on your sheet. Sound the alarm! They killed Lord MacRashley! Fantomas is in the chateau! Wake up! Bertrand! They killed Lord MacRashley! Coming! - What's going on? - They killed Lord MacRashley! - How awful! - He's dead in my bed! On my bed, how awful! Mrs. Rashley! What's going on? They killed Lord MacRashley! He's on my bed! That can't be, he's writing in his office. What is it, Commissioner? They killed Lord MacRashley! - He's in his office! - On my bed! - Like I said. - It can't be! You're not in my bed! I guess I would know. Get rid of that. What's so strange about that? It's perfectly normal. I find your husband dead in my room as he's coming out of his? That's normal? We all have our doubles in the beyond, that was his. - A ghost. - Don't start with the ghosts... There's another theory, the simplest and most obvious one. Don't make fun of me, especially abroad. Now I get it, you're the one! - Pardon? - You're Fantomas! You're wearing a Lord MacRashley mask! Take it off! Come now! Such behavior! Let me go! I'm not wearing a mask! Enough familiarity. Come, dear. You have to believe me! He's dead in my room! Come look! - To humor you. - We can't upset him. Same as before. You'll see, it's terrible. It can't be! He was here! So he must be here! He can't have left! Do you believe me? Yeah, like the hanged man. He's hanging, how would he know? But he was here, surrounded by candles and flowers! Sure it was Lord MacRashley? - Yes, on my bed. - You met him downstairs. - That's true. - You spoke to him. True. Then I must be dreaming. Yes, you're dreaming. It's just a nightmare. If I'm dreaming, then you're not here either. No one's here. - I'm here. - You're not here. - My gun! - It's not here. Commissioner, relax. You'll wake up. I'll wake up and understand? You'll understand. So will we. I don't feel like I'm sleeping. - Drink this. - What is it? - A sedative. - No! - Yes! - I'm trying to wake up. Exactly! Think about it... You take sedatives to fall asleep. When you aren't dreaming and you want to sleep. Follow me? What do you take when you're dreaming you're not asleep? - I don't know. - A sedative. Is that it? Good! Thank you. - Good night. - Thanks. Commissioner, I'll leave you my camera. If you find another body, take a picture. It'll be proof you weren't dreaming. - When I wake up! - Of course. - Pleasant wake-up. - Thanks. I'm waking up... They hanged Lord MacRashley! Lord MacRashley's hanging in my room! What's going on? Nothing! Leave me alone! How awful! Lord MacRashley's hanging in my room! What? Who? - You're raving. - He's hanging in my room! Oh my God! We have a saying: Brevity is the soul of wit. You have to believe me! Come look! - Please leave me alone. - Believe me! He looks terrible. Come look! - Let's go. - Might as well. - Unbelievable. - Yeah. The commissioner's lost his mind. Now I know why Fantomas is still free. Come look! It's terrible! - Gone again? - He was hanging right there! - I locked the door! - Are you sure? Unless I got the wrong room. Your key opened the door. Sure it was Lord MacRashley? Yeah, but hanging this time. - Did you take a picture? - Yes! 10 seconds. Here's the hanged man. What is it? He's not there! He's not in the picture. Then it was a ghost. I'm going to bed. And Lord MacRashley dead on your bed? A ghost. Sorry to disturb you for ghosts. I didn't believe in ghosts, but Scotland has ghosts. Dump his body in Loch Ness, I never want to see him again. All right. "Last warning before execution: 1 billion." - Does he think I'm AI Capone? - I got a late payment notice. "Although you have received previous notice, "your right-to-live tax remains unpaid." It goes on... "It is my duty to inform you that if payment is not made in 3 days, "a 10% surtax will be added." - This is very bad. - That's why we're here. - We must take action. - Absolutely. There's only one thing to do. We'll have to form a united front against Fantomas. How? By contacting Lord MacRashley and his friends, fellow victims of that villain Fantomas. I'll try. Come in. Lord MacRashley will see you now. Think he'll agree? I spoke to him about it and it looks good. Good evening, gentlemen. My secretary, André Berthier, explained your proposal. My friends agree to it. Since you're victims of Fantomas as well, let's join forces to try to capture him. The more we are, the better our chances. My God! I don't get it! My hand's darkening. Evil forces are at work. There are more obstacles. Here's the obstacle! It's him! Do you really think you'll find answers in the cards? It's him, the commissioner! That French commissioner isn't normal. So cruel, telling me twice my husband was dead. It is rather inconsiderate. - That reminds me... - Yes? You'll have to take care of Edward pretty soon. It's all set, for very soon. When? During Lord MacRashley's annual fox hunt. Well, if you must. The only way to break down their resistance is to kidnap one of these fools during the fox hunt. We've killed enough as a warning. Hostages are more effective. My respects. Ready to track the fox? - Good to see you. - Hello. You look splendid. Good morning. William? Bring your friends toward St. James Lane. - Mr. Fandor. - My Lord? You're a horseman, follow the pack to Black Skull Alley. Fantomas won't show up while I'm here. You never know. I called in Scotland Yard. You didn't need to. Be careful not to stray too far. If Fantomas shows up, I'm up to dealing with him. Bertrand! - Commissioner! - Easy! Did you hurt yourself? Stop hitting me! - Where's my hat? - There. - Where's my horse? - I don't know. There it is. You'll get what's coming to you. Be quiet. Come here. Sparrowhawk to Spearhead 1, Aquila 2, Beelzebub 3. Are you ready? Reply. Spearhead 1 here. Group 3, send out Artaban on Trail #7. Prepare Artaban. Wait for Artaban on Trail #7. Sparrowhawk to Spearhead: Begin Operation Artaban to get William alone on Trail #7. Do you receive? Roger, over and out. We're sending Artaban onto Trail #7. Go hunt, Artaban! Operation successful, William has arrived. We're taking him to the meeting place. Understood, go get Artaban. Roger, we'll get Artaban. Don't make any noise! Careful... Damn! Sparrowhawk to Aquila: Patrick is back on Trail #5. Send out Artaban to get him alone. Roger. Artaban is ready, I'll send him immediately to Trail #5. Go! If you hadn't forgotten your horse, I could get back. - Yeah, right... - Help me! The horse! - Where? - There! - That's a blackbird. - Under the blackbird. - There's no horse there. - Yes, there is. - I lost the blackbird. - See the horse? - Above that. - Now I see the blackbird. Hypocrite! Catch him. The swine! I think we need to call in an expert. We're in the middle of nowhere. What? - What is it? - The fox. - Where? - There. - Never seen a fox before. - Me neither. - Let's catch it. - We can't even catch a horse. - Foxes are smaller. - True. We'll circle it, then move in like scissors. No, pincers. What is this farce? Strange... Must be a trap. Let's get out of here. Where's my horse? That way, off in the distance... Idiot! He scared off Artaban. Operation Artaban compromised. Wait for orders. Roger. - You'll think of Edward? - Because I think of you. Promise me he won't suffer too much? You have my word. Don't miss him. You'll be a widow shortly. Sparrowhawk to all his men: Come here. To the rocky outcrop over the river. - Come now. - Roger. We're on our way. What do you want from me? - What's gotten into you? - It's you or me, I love your wife. So what? I'm not jealous! You won't escape me. Since you know my secret, you must die. She saw me! On your horses! Catch her, take her far away and get rid of her. Stop her! Catch her! Fandor! Help! Help! Let me go! - Relax! - Let me go! Get in! - Take her to the meeting place. - All right. Keep going! Increase altitude! Go down. Land in that clearing. Land! That way. A horse! - Looks like he's standing. - He'll sit down. - We'll try. - It's not ours. Wait a minute before taking it. - Anyone here? - Yes. Shut up and bring the horse! - Anyone here? - No, no one. Put it here. Haven't heard from the boss in a while. And it's late. - Ask if we can go back. - OK. - You have to lift me. - What? You have to lift me. Lift me! Should we go back, boss? - When I say we do. - I didn't say anything. You asked when we go back. What should I do? Go find your horse. Thanks! Answer, boss! Can we go back? What should we do? It's late. The horse talks! I have a talking horse! Should we go back? Hallucinations! We're going back. Yes, we'll go back. You first, I'll follow. It talks! I wasn't the one who murdered Lord MacRashley. How horrible! Juve was right after all. Now they're all at the mercy of Fantomas. What can we do? We can't call the police, Fantomas would kill everyone. Another plan. If Fantomas knows I escaped and might talk, anything we tried would fail. Then we'll die. Just like he wanted us to. - For real? - I'll show you. You'd never do that. If you don't want a miscarriage of justice, be a good boy and do as I say. OFF027, can you hear me? Here. Do what I said. This is OFF027, I'm listening. How is Operation Loch Ness? Completed. The girl and the reporter executed. Mission accomplished. Perfect. Wait for my orders. - Drink this. - What is it? Nothing. It'll make you sleep. Now you'll have a good snooze. Feeling better? - Who is it? - Bertrand. Better now? My head hurts. Easy with the hot-water bottle! The horse talked to me, you know. The horse talked to me. Look, horse hairs. I'm not lying. Where is the horse? We're interrogating it. Good. Nasty beast. Did it confess? Yes, of course. Here, let me take a look. Wait... I'll change your hot-water bottle. Where are we? In the room next to Lord MacRashley's. - There's no hanged man? - No. That way, we watch over him and I watch over you. Easy with the hot-water bottle. Easy with the hot-water bottle! Fantomas is giving us a grace period. If we don't pay by tomorrow at midnight we'll be executed. Fantomas will send a secret messenger tomorrow to tell us where and how we'll pay our debt. What do you make of it? It's further proof that Fantomas is all-powerful. Resisting him means death. Then we'll pay him? Paying him won't kill us. What are you doing? I left my gun in your bed. A likely story! Get out of here! I can hardly believe it! Commissioner! At it again? I've had enough! - What? - Your bed! Go get in your own! My bed! What's happening? I'm feeling dizzy. - Anyone here? - I am. Shut up! Anyone here? Yes. Hello, Commissioner. What a pleasure to see you again. Sorry to disturb you so late, but I had to speak to you. Once again, you're at my mercy. Fortunately for you, it's to ask a favor. Never! What favor? You'll finally be working with me. Never! How's that? You'll become my accomplices in a major financial deal that I'll explain to you. I'm not joking. This is what you'll do... So? - He's still quiet. - Everything's in this box. Let's synchronize our watches for tonight's meeting. - Do you know what to do? - Count on me. I slept well! I like that stuff! Not time to get up yet. You'll snooze a bit more. - Drink this. - Again? - It's good. - No coffee and croissants? Tomorrow, if you're good. Drink it. We found them sleeping here when we came in to clean. We couldn't wake them up... - Shut up, we're sleeping! - Can you believe it? We kept shaking them, but they wouldn't wake up. What a way to act! What happened, Commissioner? Where am I? At the chateau. - Where am I? - The chateau, and before? Use your head! I remember, they gave us a shot. - A shot? - Right here. No, it was here. They gave us a shot, then it's all a blank. - Don't you remember? - A shot, no... This is very mysterious. - May I add a word? - Go ahead. While I was shaking the commissioner, I heard him say several times, "We're at Fantomas's." You're right, we were at Fantomas's! Quiet! Shut up, Bertrand! You haven't told me everything. Heard of the right-to-live tax? Unfortunately. You may leave. Why didn't you tell me? He threatened our lives. - What's going on? - Nothing! Fantomas asked me to collect $1 million in diamonds from you. - I'll hand them over to you. - Me? - You. - Then what? Then I'll handle it. How will you do it? Come closer. Bertrand's and my room is right next to yours. Bertrand... will install an alarm button. He'll run it under the carpet. - Do you follow me? - It's clear. A long wire will connect the button to a red bulb that Bertrand will set up in our room. Set it up. It's taking long... He's installing it... there! When Fantomas shows up, you press the button, the bulb lights up and... Where's the gun? - I jump out... - We jump out. - You jump out. - They jump out. Good work, Commissioner. This time, Fantomas will never be able to escape you. Are you ready to take action? We're ready. No one must enter or leave tonight. Station your men around the chateau. Two of you go down into the moat. Understood. Keep me posted. Roger. In an hour I'll tune in. Go under the drawbridge, I'll stay here. Did you hear that? What happened? Come here, he's done for. As you see, I carried out Fantomas's orders to the letter. Your friends put $850,000 in diamonds in this box. All that's missing is your share. One moment. - It fell down your sleeve. - What? - Your sleeve. - Really! - Be careful! - In your pocket. At midnight, Fantomas will come get this box. In person? - He won't get far, I'm here. - We're here. At midnight, when Fantomas arrives, you press the button. - I jump out. - We jump out. - You jump out. - They jump out. - What time is it? - 6 minutes to. - I'm 2 minutes fast. - I'm 3 minutes behind. Let's not waste time. See you soon, or at least I hope so. Good evening, Dorothy. Where were you all day? What's got into you? Hello, Fantomas. I've been waiting for this. Scared? It can't be! Fantomas scared of a woman? That's funny! I don't understand what you mean. Stop! Or I'll shoot! You can see I'm Lord MacRashley. Is this a joke? No, it's no joke. Don't move. We know you're Fantomas. This time you lose. You'll never get away. You're done for this time. You murdered Lord MacRashley and took his place to get your hands on his fortune. The police are on their way. We'll capture you alive. We'll finally know who you are. Commissioner! The signal! Good work! Drop your weapons. Hands up! Thank you, Commissioner. Nice work! You ruined everything! We finally had Fantomas! - I get it! - What do you get? - That was Fantomas! - We told you! Don't make me fail again. What's going on? Nothing. - He's taking off in a rocket. - What? - He's taking off in a rocket! - I can't hear. - This is Tom Smith. - Who cares? - Who cares? - Fantomas took off in a rocket. Call every air field and activate all alarms. Alert to all bases: Begin Operation Dragonfly. You failed! That's it! I got him! Fantomas is in pieces! That's the last of him!
