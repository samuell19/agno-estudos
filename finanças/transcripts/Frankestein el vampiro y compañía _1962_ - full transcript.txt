That's all. - Very well Mr. Lavalle. Oh madame Socorro! - Yes? I'm expecting a shipment of two crates, tomorrow. They carry the wax figures of the Vampire and Frankenstein! The last two I'm missing for my collection. I would like you to personally... ...take care of making sure I receive them as soon as possible! With pleasure Mr. Lavalle. Is that all? - That's all. You may leave now,... ...and thank you so very much! These figures are so precious to me. You're welcome Mr. Lavalle. Goodbye. Hello? Is that you? Yes! Everything! Everything's going according to plan! No... No one suspects a thing. My secretary's been deceived. She's going to collect them! She believes they're wax figures! If I were to tell her what the crates really contain... ...The real bodies of the Vampire and Frankenstein... ...She'd never believe it. MARITIME SHIPPING AGENCY Cousin Agapito! My dear relative! Hey! get off mister! - So sorry miss! I'm a little blind you see! Dear Oj?n! What a surprise! What brings you here? - You know me! I get around. Look cousin something's happened, something really horrible. You don't say? - Yes Cousin. They fired me from that job... ...I had in town. I remembered my dear cousin and... Thought maybe he could help me out. You want a job right? - Yes! I need to work cousin! Look at these cannons! Feel right here. - No! Best not! You might hurt yourself! Talk about good timing!

Yes sir? - I'm here to see the doctor Yes, who should I tell her is here? Doctor Chonch?n. Ah yes, the doctor is expecting you. You may proceed to the laboratory. Good morning Doctor You start work early. - Good morning Dr. Chonch?n. Nothing could prepare me for your letter. You said the monsters have been shipped from Rome. That's correct Sofia. And I've been able to track the shipment... It's destined for someone here in town. - Someone from here? For what reason? I don't understand. Don't worry. I know practically everyone. I'll know who soon enough. I am very grateful to you for your collaboration and confidence. After all, only you know my secret. And my ambition to rid the world of such a threat. We'll succeed Doctor. You'll see. Excuse me miss. - Yes Elmer? Where would you like to have breakfast? - On the terrace. As you wish miss. - Elmer! Shall we have breakfast together Doctor? I regret not being able to join you Doctor, but I have to go to the hotel... ...for some papers. A report you know... I understand Doctor. - Goodbye for now, and thanks again Doctor. And don't worry... ...I'm convinced you and I, together, can rid the world of these monsters. Once and for all. You do your bit, and I'll do mine. Goodbye. - Farewell Doctor. Come in. Hello. Are you the detective? Yes sir! The great Hercules! Hercules the God? - No sir! Hercules 'Borolas'! How may I be of service? I want you to solve something for me. Solve something? Math equations perhaps? Not quite sir. I'd like you to investigate the whereabouts of two crates. Crates?! I need to make a phone call. Give me a twenty will you? This goes right here! Crates you said? What's inside these crates? Two bodies. Dead bodies? Murdered!? No sir, they're alive. - They must be idiots. Why idiots? - Only two idiots would lock themselves in a crate! You don't understand. The crates contain the bodies of Frankenstein and the Vampire. Go ahead and tell me a cowboy story while you're at it! This is a serious matter, listen to me. Go ahead. Hello? Understood? - No sir... I mean yes sir! And you don't need to spare. - Spare? I'm not that thin sir. I mean expenses! In any case, we'll see eachother tonight. - I can't at night because I'm a werewolf. See you later. Werewolf... ...Aren't I the cop with a dog's nose? and at least I'm in control of my instincts. Pick up! - My mother told me to never be picked up by strangers. The phone! - Oh right. Hello?! - Maritime shipping agency? Buffalo Bill speaking! Who are you? What do you want?! Listen, my call is an important one. Do you have two crates there, ready for postage? Two crates? One moment sir, let me check our books. Aha! Indeed! Indeed sir! We have two crates here. Stop being a clown! Get some manners! Don't call again! I think the phone's free now. Hey, I won't be long. Wait. Ugh you're so ugly with those big eyes! - And you're as cute as a baby monkey. If you say so. What's this? A dust cover? - Nope, an elbow cover. Do the accounts! - By squared roots? Straight roots! - Alright. Pencil... Where's my pencil? Sir, would you care to send this fish bowl to Morelia, MI? Morelia MI-chigan? - Michoac?n! Ahhh! They sound the same you know. Michoac?n and Michigan. Of course miss. Just one moment, let me finish this accounting. It's prank time! What's her problem? It was just a prank! Agapito... You grow crazier by the day. Grow up man! Here, find this suitcase. - 32B45. Yes - Right away sir! Quit the act! This isn't the army! Go on! You poor thing. Are you hurt? How terrible! No no, this is how I work. - No it looks like you're hurt. Where do you feel pain? - My hand. This is terrible. Let me massage it. No no!, if you massage it it'll feel worse. - Not at all. Your blood needs to circulate. That's so nice, a little bit higher please. - Like that? Just like that. I feel so much better now. Almost there. Fine now. You have such lovely divine hands miss! Hey! Show some respect! Please don't scold him. - Good afternoon? I'm here to collect two crates in the name of Mr. Lavalle. I'm his secretary. - Lavalle? Who knows? Yes miss. Here they are. Help me Agapito. This shipment must be very important. No? - That's correct miss. Precious and valuable Imagine, these crates contain wax figures of the Vampire and Frankenstein. Exact replicas of the originals in the Italian Wax Museum. They must be marvelous. Oh yes! Mr. Lavalle has the largest collection of wax figures imaginable. Look at the time! I'm so happy you feel better. Goodbye. May we cross paths again. I'll leave you for now. Please bring the crates to Mr. Lavalle's address tonight. This favor will be well compensated. That won't be necessary miss. Right Agapito? - That's right. What kind of compensation... ...are we talking about here? - Let's say 3,000 pesos. If you insist. Good. I would like to ask something else of you too. Please treat the crates with... ...care. So the figures shouldn't break. We'll follow your orders faithfully miss. - Thank you. Good day. Joker! Sound! The door bell man! Hey! It's open! Okay. Let's take the crates inside. Are you freezing or something? - Me! yes. What a weight. Where's the light switch? It's over here Are you really afraid of dummies? They're wax man! Feel! This one too? - They're all wax. Good evening miss. The human vampire! So what? It's a fictional character that never existed. This hellish creature hypnotizes its victims, and its powerful suggestion... ...makes them its slaves. Can transform into an animal... ...And feeds itself on the blood of its victims. Foolishness. Sure! Foolish Great! The lights going out will definitely lighten the mood. What can we do now Paco? Look!, how lucky is that! a candle! Good! I'm afraid Paco! - No no. Afraid of what? Everything's fine. Where are you going!? - I'm going to see if I can fix the light!.. ...Perhaps a fuse went. Horror stories! Stories. Why should I be scared? They're just pure wax. Me scared? Scared... Scared... Come on man. No way man. No fear at all. Why should I be scared? I'm a brave man. What fear? What fear... They're just wax. How can I be scared? You're just wax. Hard wax. Pure wax. Pure wax. This one must be made of sponge. It's so gusty in here. I feel someone following me. What are you talking about? They're just wax. Pure wax. Heads were chopped off here. That's why they can't be just wax. They drop things. I couldn't find the switchboard. I'll keep looking elsewhere. Don't you need any help? - No, I want you to stay right here. Bu-Bu-Bu-Bu - It's Paco! Bu-Bu-Bu-But don't be long! - No no, and don't be afraid! Pure wax. Just pure wax. Hurry! We must take the bodies and go before he wakes up! Where's Dr. Chonch?n? - He's nowhere to be found. We must inform him the monsters are in our possession. He must be searching for them like crazy. Hurry! Hurry up! Close the crates! Good. Let's get out of here. I can't find the switchboard anywhere. Buah, this wimp's fallen asleep. Wake up Agapito! What's wrong with you? Don't be a clown! What's wrong? What is it? You ruffian! Why hit me like that? - Me?, I didn't do anything. Must have been a nightmare. How did you get into my house? We weren't expecting you this late. My children are sleeping! Oh, they're finally mine. My collection will finally reach completion. I was only missing these two figures! Let's take them out. To display them! Come on men! The coffin awaits the Vampire! What! What's the meaning of this!? Where the hell are the figures!? Maybe a mistake by the museum? - No that's impossible! They should be here! Someone must have stole them. - Who steals wax figures!? Probably a candle factory. - Shut up! This is no laughing matter! My figures had better turn up! Or I'll hold you two responsible! Well!, anything to say? I don't... But he does! - What? I don't either! We're not to blame! - Oh of course you're right!... ...Forgive me lord! My dear figures! where can they be! Don't worry sir. We'll find them for you. Right Agapito? Sure! Thank you gentlemen. Thank you so much. I'll have you know... For every figure you find, I'll give you 1,000 pesos as a reward. And if we find both? - 2,000 pesos. And if we don't find any? - If you don't find them... ...You'll both go to jail! One of them was like this. Look. You're going mad. The other one was kind of like this. Stop this nonsense. I swear I felt him behind me! His footsteps were like this. He caught up to me and wack! Next thing I'm flat on the ground. Look at the bump. Oh my, it's true then. You see? Then they stole the figures! Now that's who stole them! - Who?! The thieves! - I already knew that much! If you already knew why didn't you tell me? Agapito! Sometimes you're so stupid. Stupid Stupid... ...But charming! Look, The other one was like this. What are you doing in here!? Excuse me, but I've been looking for you two. You both work at the shipping agency right? - Right! Did you deliver two boxes? - Yes, so what? Where to? We delivered them to Mr. Lavalle. That's where the bodies must be. - The bodies? You said bodies. I thought they were wax figures. What wax figures? - That's right!, except they weren't even... ...there! The boxes were empty. They're gone. What a shame. Where will I find them now? - They're not here I can assure you, take a look. The moon... It will soon appear. - The moon! There's no time to lose! Lock me in a room right away! You must be mad! What kind of act is this?! - I'll explain later! I'm not a madman,... ...You must help me! Lock me in please! - Are you serious?! It's a matter of life or death. Do what the crazy... I mean gentleman,... ...asks. - Surely, please follow me... I've never felt this tall! This way. Look. This room has keys in the door. It should be empty. Lock me in, and take the keys. It... That's it! That's it! What happened? Let me tell you! That man's madder than a skunk dipped in perfume! Not again... One two three. One two three four. Look! That man left his bag here! Shouldn't I take it to him? Do whatever you want! Go ahead! My body needs the exercise. - He might need it. I'll take it to him. I'm a sandpiper! No!, what if he's sleeping? He'll get angry if I wake him up! What if he's awake. I'll go and see. Yes! In any case, I'll just put the bag inside. And it's open! Oh boy, my courage was almost broken that time! Isn't this enough to drive one mad? - I can't believe it Mr. Lavalle. I resign to the fact. My figures have disappeared,... ...And my collection remains incomplete. Are there any suspects sir? - Yes! The men from the shipping agency. I'm certain they know something. Would you like me to investigate sir? - Exactly. Become their friend. Seduce them. Marry them. Whatever. Just discover the whereabouts of my figures. - I'll start immediately Mr. Lavalle. And don't worry about costs, I'm willing to spend my entire fortune to recover them! Good. If you'll excuse me. And so, what is your opinion on them Doctor? We must kill them before they wake up. They present great danger. Go ahead and prepare two R2N injections. Right away Miss. Elmer! Stay still! No! I won't let you harm me! Look at me! - I'll be the one who kills you! Look at me! - No! I won't! Stay still - No... Stay still. Look at me... Look at me! - I don't want to!... Want... You are under my command. You will obey me. Yes Master. Order me. You will organize a great party, to summon fresh blood for me. As you order Master. Doctor... - Stay there! Don't move. I am your Master. You will obey me. Yes... Master. I command you to replace Frankenstein's mind with another, one more obedient. I require his physical strength for my plans to conquer America. As you order Master. I will do as you have commanded. It will not be easy... ...to find an obedient mind. You needn't worry Master. I already know of one that is obedient... ...Weak... ...Na?ve... That of a fool. Watch out! I almost messed my hair up! What's eating you? Clock, block, mock... Someone's knocking! Come on in chin-chin-chin! Madame So... I meant Sofia! Welcome... Welcome. What brings you here? Good morning Agapito. - And a good morning to you too. Aren't you handsome today? I have favorable days. This must be one of them. What makes you say that? See dear, today I'm holding a party at my castle, and would like you to attend. You will be my special guest. Will you come? Well, I need to check my agenda first. No... ...Don't be like that. Tell me... I really wonder... ...What does he have, that I don't? A brain... ...An obedient brain. Will you come then? Yyyyyy-yes. Please come a bit earlier, so we can spend some time alone together. Surely... I'll be there like a rocket. A brain... A brain... I don't... I can't get it! Clock, block... I mean someone's knocking! Let's see who it is this time!? Good morning. Good morning Agapito. Do you remember me? I'm pleased to hear that. I can't take my mind of you. Have you had breakfast yet? No. - Wonderful. How about we have it together? I can't. I'm broke. - Don't worry!, I'll pay. In that case sure! You know something Agapito... Since I first set eyes on you, I just knew, you're the man for me. Love at first sight... ...I can't shake it! I'll wait downstairs my love. Don't take too long. Believe me I won't. I don't understand! I don't get it! You bastard... ...I've got it, I know what you've got! A charm!... A rabbits' foot! Where is it!? - I don't have anything! I don't have a rabbits' foot. - Then what? Well, I have... - Tell me! Tell what you've got!? A pair of aces!... Hah no not really. I have... brains! An obedient brain. - Now listen here! You better share one... ...of those women with me! Otherwise I'll strangle you! None of this is my fault! - Let's get out of here! Who is he to scold you? It's prank time! Paco... Wait a sec, your tie isn't straight. I'll fix it for you. There you are. You won't be needing this. Is it good? - It's great. Look, there you go. What possessed you!? I can't believe what I put up with from you! It's my condition Paco... - Condition! I'll cure you... I'll cure you, with herbs! With herbs! I'm your cousin, not your father! You're choking me! Enough already! There we are. - Let's go man! Ah! The man I locked up last night! - Let's go and see him. Oh my... Look at this place. Who's scared now? Scared yourself huh? - Well, yes. What a mess. Is this man a maniac or something? Perhaps an earthquake. Look! some pens. They're mine now. Good morning. Morning! How are you? We were just cleaning up a bit. What on earth happened here last night? The place is trashed! I'll explain... I'm a werewolf. I'm not lying. When the full moon appears, I become a wolf. This is the result. I cannot help myself. The same wolf from Little Riding Hood? This isn't a joke! - Did you rip this with your teeth? When the beast awakes inside me, it overpowers any human instincts. I kill... I slaughter... Without being aware of whos life I'm taking. It's so horrible... ...Horrible! - I can imagine. Poor you. You have our sympathy. I've considered committing suicide. But there's something I must do first. Fulfilling a promise I made to myself and the world. To rid the world of Frankenstein and the Vampire! This is why I came to you for help. We can't! I'll pay you well. Now we can! I don't feel like partying anymore. - Don't be a clown, what's wrong with you? I don't feel like entering alone. Would you both accompany me? We're not invited! - He's right Paco. We're not. Well... One invitee, can invite whoever. Besides, look how elegant you look. - I'm always elegant remember. If you insist why not. Right? - Sure. What a barefaced butler. - This isn't a beauty contest. You may come in. We are expecting you. What about my Rolls Royce? Don't worry. I'll take it to our garage. Come in. Good evening. It's lovely to see you all again. - I invited my friends, hope you don't mind. Good thinking Agapito. Good thinking. Welcome both of you. There's nothing quite like young blood. You may leave us Elmer. - Yes miss. I'm so pleased you came dearest. We'll have such a great time. Oh Sofia... You're making me brush. - Brush? I meant blush. But why?, are you embarassed? - They're both watching us from behind. Miss Sofia. Do you remember Miss Socorro? I believe so. - We met at the postal office. Remember? Ah yes of course! Hello again! - How are you? Very well. Where are your outfits? - We didn't know it was a costume party. Oh of course! It's my fault. I forgot to tell Agapito. Anyhow, it doesn't matter. I have some you can wear. Would you like to try some on while the gentlemen accommodate themselves? I'd love to. - Act like you're at home. Have as many... ...drinks as you like. Afterwards you may go into the dressing room Follow me please. What a pad huh? - That's right cousin, and all of this will soon be mine. Hey wait, I didn't give you permission. You can drink water in stead. When I marry Sofia, I'll give orders to never let you in. I'll have you thrown to my dogs. You'll see! Let's see who's calling. Hello? This is Ivanhoe speaking! It's our friend. - Listen Agapito,... All leads suggest Frankenstein and the Vampire are at the castle. Hello? Yes. It's me. Alright. Are you sure? Good. We'll follow your instructions. We'll wait for you here. Yes. Let's search the castle. Where should we start? - What about that way? Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, Catch a tiger by the toe. Yep! that way. - Let's go. Follow me! A dragon! A dragon that will devour me! Shut up, can't you see it's dead?! What if it should resurrect?! It's so awful down here. Don't hide please Paco! I won't throw you to the dogs I promise! Where are you Paco?! I beg you! I beg you! Come out! Where are you!? One, two, three hands? Three hands!? I'm no freak! Oh Paco, where were you? You had me so worried. Do excuse me sir. No please! Please don't! Monster! - What happened man!? Franky, and Vampy... In there! They want suck blood, kill! - Talk properly! I can't understand you. The mons-mons-mons - The what!? The monsters! - It's just your imagination! No! - You'll see, just your imagination! Don't go through there! They'll eat you! They're mad! Run! Calm down. Yes, later, later. Your invitation sir? The invitation. See, I was invited by phone, so I forgot it at home. I'll go and get it. - Fine sir. I am sure this party will be marvelous, as marvelous as you are. I hope so. Please enjoy yourselves. Good evening sir. Found your invitation? - A friend is bringing it with him. Who? - The chubby one over there. Which chubby one? Excuse me sir. Have you seen a man dressed like a cossack? A short man with a moustache? - That's the one. He went that way. - Thank you sir. There you are. There you are! He got away! I've been looking for you! - Look! What is it? Stop right there! What's this! Invading the ladies room?! Yes miss? - Sir! a man just went in there! I know. I'll have him removed immediately. Thank you sir! - You're welcome miss. The party's getting livelier! I'm so pleased you're enjoying yourselves. Oh, is something wrong miss? - No You've gone very pale miss. - No, it's nothing. Just a little migraine. It must be the heat. I'll take an aspirin. - Would you like to be seen by Dr Blanco?,.. ...He's such a specialist. What you need is a touch of pirulite, divine herbs for the throat, and a bath of water... ...From Sanguinetaceticumun! - That won't be necessary. May I accompany you? - No thank you, I'll be fine. Excuse me. I sensed your call Master, and so I came. The time has come for you to introduce me to your guests. But Master. I must select my victims. I need blood. I'm... weakening But Master, it's impossible at this hour. - You will obey my command! It's so great to see you Mr Werewolf, Agapito and I've been waiting for you. There's so much to tell you. - I'll wait in the hallway. Call the Doctor! - But I'm feeling fine! The wolf's here! - I'm not big or bad! Quit the jokes and follow my lead! In which key!? - I meant follow me! I won't be long. - Fine. How could you let the Vampire escape?! - We were the ones who escaped! Time's running out for me... The moon will be out soon and I'll turn. - What do you suggest we do? Take me to where you last saw the Vampire. - Right, this way. That's the Vampire, next to Sofia! - Let's go Is this a thermometer? - No, it's a cigarette holder! May I gaze upon your sunny and radiant face? Ay! What an eclipse! Allow me to introduce you to... - Mmm, haven't we met? I doubt it. - I know someone just like you, but with much sharper teeth! That's quite impossible. This is Count Lorensichupamilchupachupa... ...from Transylvania. - My oh my! Well I am Agapo Achecas. Would the Count like a drink? - No, thank you. Well I do! I need one after the fright I just had. Come on loosen up! How about a tequila with sangrita? No!.. With sangrita (little blood) say you?! Sangrita? Sangrita? - That's what I said! Now get off me!... ...Your breath smells like rats! Am I to understand that in this country, blood is drank from glasses? Oh yes! In glasses, flasks, jars and even cups! I want! I want! I want! - Count... Shall we prepare your drink? - Yes! I need fresh blood. I dearly hope you like it. A nice colour, let's try. What's wrong!? - What is this stuff?! This is anemic! I need fresh blood! Hold your horses! In these parts sangrita is composed of tomato juice, lemon... ...and a small chili. This helps one swallow - This is an imposture! I prefer to dance. Care to dance? - With pleasure Count What about us handsome? - With great pleasure! What's he up to? - Beats me. You are a very beautiful woman. - Why thank you. You are both handsome... ...and charming yourself, Count. Will you be staying with us long? Possibly, but should I stay, I'll be needing a special companion. Whoever agrees will be presented with a marvelous gift. Immortality. Immortality? It's so hot in here, shall we take a walk in the gardens? I might catch a chill, but let's go! Help! My pearls are stolen! Stay calm everyone! I'll take care of this right away! Who are you? - None less than detective H?rcules! Now... ... What was stolen exactly madame? - My necklace was ripped from my neck... ...while I was dancing. - It'll turn up soon enough, don't worry. Please help me detective! It's a family heirloom! Aha! Please be so kind as tell me where you were when madame screamed. Talks in Italian: Listen sir, I was dancing when I heard the woman scream, and didn't hear a thing... I'm not hearing you either as I can't understand a word you're saying!... Maybe it's because of the height. Let's see, if I can get up there... Perhaps I'll hear you better now. - Talks in Italian: I told you sir, I'm... ...no thief. I don't have the jewellery. - We're talking about a necklace here,... ...not a collar. A necklace was stolen. - Talks in Italian: Maybe someone else... ...witnessed something, not me! - I'll explain it to you in Italian,... ... (Talks in bad Italian). - Talks in Spanish : I don't understand sir. Ah so you speak Spanish? - Yes, I do. Why didn't you tell me?! - You didn't ask me! Hah that's right. We're playing around right now and I'm going to get... ...this matter solved. - It's no big deal. I had a necklace... ...stolen once. Only I did feel the thief, and didn't scream. Why didn't you? - I thought maybe his intentions were good. A thief with good intentions... This is a mess. What's needed here... ...is a detective. - Why a detective? A detective like me who can untie this knot. Ladies and gentlemen, to avoid offending anyone by addressing you... ...all personally. I propose the following activity to recover the necklace. The music plays, you all dance. Suddenly the lights will be turned off, and the... ...necklace will be placed faithfully in my hand. Otherwise, I'll feel obliged to use... Everybody dance! Dance! And now! Lights off! Necklace my hand! There we are, lights on! The necklace... What kind of person... What's going on here!? You were going to recover my necklace, Right? Allow me to suggest another way. Whoever has the necklace can keep it, just give me back my gun! It was my grandfather's! Back to dancing! Dancing! Once! Twice! Thrice! Lights off! Lights on! Agapito, gaze deep into my eyes... What do you see? In this one nothing, this thing's in the way But this one, a cataract. - Don't be silly! See the love I feel for you. And tell me... Do you like me? I like you more than living without work. - Then what are we waiting for? The night is young The air so fresh So perfect for love I'm hungry for you I want your brain and your blood Well in that case, we'll buy a kilo of blood sausages, tortillas and salsa! No! It's you I want! I want you to come back when everyone's left But alone Alone, understand? Promise? Sure, I promise. Agapito we need to talk! So, as promised? - As promised. Keep yelling like that and you'll damage your throat! Socorro's disappeared! There's no trace of her in the ballroom! Let's search the gardens. And triple our chances by splitting up. What's up Paco? Don't be such a clown, snap out of it! Take that stupid mask off! Any sign of Socorro? I'm not having any luck Let's search this way together. Snap out of it pal! Come on! Have a headache do we?! The neck's been bitten! Looks like a sadist's on the loose! A cannibalistic one at that! Let's put the blame on Paco It'll be a hoot! Why did you try and bite me? - Me?! What's happened Paco? - First Socorro, now Agapito's missing. I bet they're kidnapped, held at the castle. We must save them! Calm yourself. They're safe for now. The Vampire sleeps during the day. We must wait until nightfall. Once awake, he's ours. This is the only way to save them. Hello? Yes, speaking. What? Are you sure? At the castle? I'm heading there right now! I await your command Master Frankenstein is evermore weaker. We must operate immediately! Do you know what I will do to you? I'll take your brain Giving it to Frankenstein Take them to the laboratory right away! The girl too? - Yes. Her too. I'll take care of her, once the operation is over. A great destiny is reserved for her. Now, follow me! Lie down I'll have you know, my brain isn't worth much! It's empty! - What'll we do? Find them! I will transfer their blood. Agapito's will become Frankenstein's. His, Agapito's. Assuming each other's identity in the process. Thus completing the operation. What is this for? - It conducts electricity at high voltages. This will maintain the strength needed to survive the operation. Wouldn't my cousin Paco's brain be more useful?! He's so meek and docile! Enough! Yours is less rebelious! If I'm a rebel I sure don't have a cause! Just watch me! Everything is ready Master The circulation is perfectly in synch. Now Ay! - The chisel's cold! Just a moment... ...Couldn't you get me an aspirine? I'm about to have a headache! Stay where you are! My brain is free! Lie down Frankenstein! It's happening! Agapito is now Frankenstein!... ...Frankenstein's now Agapito! Don't you remember me Agapo?! It's me! Your cousin! What's come over him! Has he gone mad?! It's the blood transfusion. Agapito's now Frankenstein! And Frankenstein is Agapito! - How long will this last!? I don't know! Minutes, or hours... How could you do this Sofia!? - The Vampire manipulated me! Forgive me! Escape!
