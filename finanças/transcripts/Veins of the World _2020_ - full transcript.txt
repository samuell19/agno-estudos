- Hi Bataa. - Hi. Dad, can you pick me up an hour later? What, are you going to do homework for once? - Hello Uncle! - Hello Bataa! Someday I'll pick you up and you'll have square eyes! - No way! - Hey, what's up? - So, did you download it yet? - No, not yet. The teacher took our mobile phones last night. And the connection is too slow in the daytime, but tonight it will work! Look here. This year's jury. Hello, how are you! - We are fine, and how are you! - Sit down, please. Kids, I have some exciting news. The Mongolia's Got Talent tryout is taking place in our province. Anyone who would like to audition needs this form with their parents' signature. But why, ma'am? My parents don't want to sing. Of course not. But your parents must give permission. Because if you win, you will go to the city and sing on TV. I will give it to you after class. Let's start with the lesson. Buy meat! Buy meat! - Hi. - How are you? I'm good. All of a sudden my car eats the motoroil. It didn't sound good before. I'll have a look. I'll buy one kg of this! I have more, if you want... I'll take these. First the money for the "Cheese". Cheese! Cheese! Come get the best cheese! I have to go. Goodbye. Here, the registration form for Mongolia's Got Talent. You or mom has to sign it. Okay, yes. Put it in your bag. I'll get around to it. We need to make a stop along the way. So we have to hurry up! Hello, my friend. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? Good autumn? Good. Let's go in. Hi, everyone. Oh, hello. Sit here. There are so many inspections at the moment! And how is it going? They're costing us a lot of time. In the end, it's a question of making an agreement. The nomad council will meet at my place to discuss the gold mining problem. You know that already. Are you coming? Hyagaa, we have to pull together, to have a chance against the big mines. Stay away from the hole! Understood? Are you okay, my son? You okay? Let's go. Bring them back. Bring them back, my daughter. Try it from the east. Bring them to me. Altaa! Look who's coming? Daddy! Come here, my daughter. Take good care of them! I don't know how many animals will make it through the winter. We need to take the money and move before it's too late! That's the point! They're waiting for us to give up. And with the land unprotected, they can do whatever they want. They promise that they will renature. And they promised us compensation for the move. What more do you want? Don't be so naive, Zaya! If we trust them and move away they will leave the land poisoned. Then wherever we move, they will drive us out of there. We will be the last ones left! You'll see. If you keep this up, no compensation, no more animals. There will be nothing left. Maybe you used different gas or new oil? That can't be it. I just filled it up yesterday. And I always use the same oil. Are you looking for this? Huh, what it's doing there? Shit! Those kids again... Last time it was water. That wasn't so bad. But with sugar, there's only one thing you can do. Well, what is it? Get a new engine. Sweetheart, can I have the cheese? Hello, Altaa... are you afraid of us? No, I'm brave enough! Then show me! When I grow up I'll wear a golden hair clip. But why a golden one? Because it's bright and shiny. It's hot here. Let's take off your deel. And then it's time for a song. It's from my grandfather, so your great-grandfather. Where did great-grandfather learn the song? Maybe also from his grandfather or great-grandfather... Oh, I didn't know all grandfathers were music teachers. Come on, let's sing now. I fell asleep. Amra, come here and eat breakfast. Wow, you brought a lot of salt. Hey, what are you going to sing at the contest? I like "Golden Veins" the best. But the text is a bit too childish for me. What do you mean by that? How can I explain? Like a fairy tale... You know the mountain spirit, right? Like that. It doesn't really exist. Of course it's real. The mountain spirit exists. If you believe... in him with all your heart, he'll give you all kinds of power. Come on, get up... Dad! I need your signature by tomorrow. Please don't forget. Yes, of course. So, get up! Be courageous! Nice, slow, deep breaths. Look around. And imagine thousands of eyes are fixed on you. Go ahead. Once upon a time Before greed prevailed In the beginning of time Our planet was woven of gold That is why we call it "Golden Earth" To remind the world let's sing this hymn. Is the tea ready? The first visitors are coming. Zorigoo's family is coming from the north. You are late. Amra, please get some dung. Okay. Do as your mother told you! - Hey, everybody. - Hey, Bataa! Look how you've grown! - Sister. - Hello, dear sister! - Take a seat. - A little fermented horse milk. Take a seat. - Good autumn? - Good. Where have you been recently? My grand-children go to school, so I'm herding every day. Hello, everyone. - I hope you've been enjoying the autumn. - Yes! Are you angry about the signature? Tell me. But we have a solution for it: In order to return to our land, we need a legal guarantee that the steppe will be renatured. What do you think? Well, it's difficult. The politicians sit in their golden houses in Ulaanbaatar. They act like their parents and grandparents were never nomads. The mining companies are strangers here. They do not feel connected to the place. They take the gold and throw away the chest it's in. And this chest, this land, is our home! But also, more and more locals are doing it. When did we become like this? We can't remain silent. Who cares! Before the foreigners exploit us, we can do it ourselves! What good is the gold to you? You can't eat or drink it. Want to know? Because its fun. And some people even envy me. Digging holes is fun for you? - We've lost our herd! - Us, too. We have the right to live, don't we? - My children should be able... - It's about all our children! Don't fight! You are all children of the same river. We inhabit this land of our ancestors and have been living peacefully. But now we have to work together. It is time we gather our forces and speak as one. And I think that voice should be Erdene. Yes, we must choose a leader. Who votes for Erdene? Let's all vote for him. What a responsibility! But we all want to save our land. In my opinion, first we should stop the companies that are mining but only have a license to explore. Have a look at this cadastral map. They're digging a big hole in front of Nymaas. And Tumruu's summer land is already ruined. Mining is forbidden within 200 meters of the river. But they do it anyway. - May I have your attention? - They're changing the river's course. I want to ask you something. Who has already made the decision to leave? Who has already accepted the compensation? - Zaya, please... - Raise your hands! It's an open secret. She's right. If it's true, raise your hands! I prefer to take the small compensation before we end up with nothing. - Yes, it's true. - What choice do we have? Our cousin pushed his luck. The company started digging right in front of his yurt. Then he had no choice and left. But his animals were all very scrawny. Because the watering holes were dry. They didn't even reimburse him for the cost of moving! Come on, my daughter. Not now. When? What does your fight have to do with me? Amra, come here! Come here. Hurry. Give me your pen. - Hello. - Hello. What's your name? Bat-Ireedui Zorigoo. - What do you have for us? - I will sing a folksong. Okay. Please stop. Thank you. That's enough for today. We'll take a look at you again next year. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. He was so cute. Next. Hello. - Please introduce yourself. - My name is Uchral. - How old are you? - Ten. - And your talent? - Dancing. Okay, good luck. You can't go in. - Hello. - Hello. - What's your name? - Amar Erdene. - How old are you? - Twelve. Twelve. And what's your talent? - I'm singing "Golden Veins." - Golden... Veins. Okay. Let's start. Okay, don't be scared. Let's start again. Oh, come on! You sang great. You needed a second try. So what? It just shows the jury how brave you are. Dad, what about Mom? I'll find the right moment and tell her about it. Let's take the shortcut to not make your mother wait. Hey Dad, all the famous stars will make a decision based on the audition today. I am so curious. What's going to happen? If I am invited to the show, thousand of people will watch me. Imagine it! My classmates will search on YouTube: Amra the Singer! If you get invited, they give you a dancing and singing coach. And you three get put up in a hotel in Ulaanbaatar. Maybe you'll get your own chauffeur. Mom will cry, she'll be so excited. Hold on! This is not your land! - Amra! - Hey! - Go away! - Don't! - Amra, my son, don't do this. - Go away! - Go! - Stop it! Amra, do I have to lose you too? - I can't see in the dark. - I'll read it for you. Thank you. "We request that you leave the licensed area 2-37..." There are a lot of numbers here. Are these coordinates? "We request that you leave the area by August 1." "Please cooperate as our work proceeds!" "Noise and dust will be unavoidable. We apologize for that." "Yours, Global Mining Corporation." We got the same letter. They want you gone! They noticed that the last resistance died with Erdene. Sister, come and live with us! Yes, we can take turns with the herd. Amra can board with Bataa. Living together with Bataa. That would be fun, huh? I'm not leaving! Don't do that, my son. You're a man, now. - Amra, listen to me... - I'm not your son! My son... You always wanted something other than Dad. It's the truth! Stop... And now there's no one in your way. You've already forgotten Dad! - Let me talk to him. - Please, Zorigoo... They say the mines are only as strong as their machines. - Bataa. - What? - Go get the sugar! - Sugar? It's in the cabinet. A brown bag. Bring it all. Okay. I feel that the test drilling will be a success here. To our golden country! I have a nose for gold. Hey, get the cigarettes from the car! I heard... Do you know what Caretaker Gombo said? People think your father's spirit went into the machines. Everybody's talking about it. Nothing works anymore. It wasn't easy keeping my mouth shut! You're the son of Mercedes Erdene, aren't you? Don't you remember me? You invited us to the nomadic council. I didn't recognize you. Sorry about that, Mr. Ninja. You have your father's sense of humor. Your old man... By the way, do you know the story of the Mercedes star? Tourists were stranded in the Gobi Desert without any water. If not for your father, they would have died of thirst. They had a Benz. So he ripped the star off his car and gave it to my dad. He was so proud that he hung the star around the neck of his horse. He would arrive at school with his Benz horse. When he got older and built his own car, he christened it with that star. Thank you, sir. I can walk home from here. Get home safe! Sir! I forgot my cheese. I'll take one. Here. Wait! It's okay. You can keep the change, Benz. Thank you, sir. Amra. I'll start to pack our things. It's hard to live here now. The money from the cheese isn't enough. Who knows? Check it out! Dairy products are good against poisoning! We should sell it to the ninjas. That's how you can advertise! He gave you 5,000 tugrik. Realistically, you get 1,000 per slice. If you sell ten slices a day, that's 10,000 tugrik. Bataa! Stand up! What is the solution? Two. Mom. Mommy. Are you afraid of me? I'm not afraid of you. I'm not afraid of Altaa. Bring a winch. Dig your heels into the wall of the shaft! Yes, that's right. We'll get a mechanical crane. Pull him up! Higher! Higher! One, two, three! One, two, three! Fuck! Why was he down there so long? No longer than the rest of us! Bastards. Until the motor is fixed, we need to do it by hand. Each person, five buckets. After that you switch. Got it? Sir, cheese is good against poisoning. Let's get the bucket out. What do you want? Get away from the hole! Still full. You should clean the rust off the spark plug. It has to be clean. What did you say? Clean the snot out of your nose, kid! Then tell me who to marry! - Right? - Get up! Check the spark plugs. Amra, wait for us! Walking? It actually was the spark plug. Our boss said you have your father's talent. Can you come back tomorrow? With cheese? We have more things to repair. - Will you? - Okay. This is for you. Get home safe. Mommy! Come here. Amra! Come here. Take it. Not enough? Take it. Thank you. There you are, my son. - Are you hungry? - I'm fine. Dinner will be ready soon. Have some tea. - Cheese sales were good? - Yes. At the big mines many machines are broken now. Something is wrong. Maybe their noise woke up the spirits! Then we better keep quiet. Bring them back to the herd. Yes, that's right. You see, that's it. Now it's your turn. You're late! Sold all the cheese again? Step with your feet into the bucket and hold tight. It will be okay. Now close your eyes! Go. Do you want more to eat? My son. Why won't you talk to me? - Hello! - Hello! - How was your trip? - Good, thank you. Hope, the tending was good! Hello. - Please, have some food. - Thank you. How is Amra? Is his condition stable? I... I don't know what you're talking about. He hasn't been to school for a few days and Bataa said he's very sick. I should have called. I'll just make some tea. No need. I'm in a bit of a rush. Let's not lose any time. I'll make it anyway. This is why I'm here. This is an invitation to Mongolia's Got Talent. Amra has been invited to participate. We are so proud. I wanted to tell him in front of the class but he wasn't there. And the competition in Ulaanbaatar is starting very soon. But where is Amra? Warning! Look out! Mom! Mom! Get me the ball. How was school today? Amra. Talk to me! Say something! Wash your hands. Okay, my sister. Be careful. Where is my son? My son... Where is my son? I'm asking you! Where is he? Tell me! Where is my son? Say something. Sister, where is he? Amra! Come out! What! He is here? - No way! - Wait, sister. Let's see him first. I can't believe it! Have you gone crazy? Who did that? You pull a young boy into this illegal business! I'll report this. I'll have you sent to jail. Don't go too far! What were you doing with that human trash? That's not where you're supposed to be. Didn't you think about your mother? I thought you were the kind of man who helps his mother. - You're always yelling. - Shut up! What a beautiful son. How beautiful... and so much potential. What's wrong with you? What is that? "Congratulations! You have been selected by our jury to participate in Mongolia's Got Talent. Good luck at the next level in Ulaanbaatar." "Amra Erdene." This is for Amra! Mongolia's Got Talent. You are so good. Zaya! What's going on here? What's that? We are so busy with moving. We need everyone. Sister... leave us alone. Please. It's all my fault... my fault... If I hadn't sung, Dad would still be alive. Don't say that! It was an accident! I'll never sing again. What? Amra, it wasn't your fault. It happened because I sang. Mom, it's all my fault. My son. Listen to me. It wasn't your fault. Understand? It was an accident! It wasn't your fault, my son. It wasn't your fault. Mom, at the market people said that Dad's ghost came back. I believe it. I think your father would be very proud... if he saw you singing on stage. Get out of the way! - Where did you get the TV? - It's from the mayor. Hello. - I turned right. - Then turn left. Left? Okay. Keep moving. There's no signal here. Keep moving. Are you ready? Okay, follow me. Good luck! - Hello. - Hi. - What's your name? - Amra. What do you do? Okay, okay, right there. Don't move! - Hello! - Hello! - Tell us your name. - My name is Amra Erdene. Be quiet! Amra, why did you chose this song? I've been singing this song with my father since I was little. And every time I sing it, I feel him with me. Good luck. Once upon a time Before greed prevailed In the beginning of time Our planet was woven of gold That is why we call it "Golden Earth" To remind the world let's sing this hymn. Here and here they started mining. As a result, two ponds shrunk. They changed the course of the river several times... And renaturing? They forgot all about it. When the last golden vein is exposed The demons awaken Life will be extinguished forever And the earth falls into dust. That is why we call it "Golden Earth" To remind the world let's sing this hymn. Gold is unattainable happiness Gold is endless suffering This truth is told over generations From grandparents, to parents, to us That is why we call it "Golden Earth" Let's sing this hymn for every living thing.
