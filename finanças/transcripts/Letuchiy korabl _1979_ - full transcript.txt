Soyuzmultfilm The Flying Ship (based on a Russian folk tale) - You'll come out! -I will not come out! - You'll come out! -I will not come out! - You'll come out! -I will not come out! - You'll come out! -I will not come out! - You'll come out! -I will not come out! - You'll come out! -I will not come out! - You'll come out! -I will not come out! I will not! I will not! I will not! - I said - You'll come out! - I will not come out! I will not come out to Polkan, do not ask me again! - This is the last time I ask: "Will you come out and marry Polkan?" - I will not come out! - Then stay here, You won't be allowed to leave! - Ha-ha-ha-ha! - Guards! (Princess singing) - How unhappy we princesses are. The law forbids us to love. In royal families, such is the ancient custom - You get married out of calculation... But I do not want, do not want calculation! I want to be married, be married out of love! Freedom, liberty, give me liberty - I'll fly up like a bird! We princess must live in captivity and lose the years of our youth in vain. We always must think of the crown, and obey the will of the tsar. But I do not want, do not want to think of the crown! Of love, of love I want to think! I want a chance for freedom, for freedom!- I'll fly up like a bird! - All the dowry is used up now! (Singing) - I'm a simple man and I will say it openly, Such beauty I've never seen in my life. And now not a day can I live without you. Can you imagine - I fell in love with the Tsar's daughter! I don't have much practice speaking of love, Forgive me, if I don't express myself well. I am a man who doesn't like to speak empty words, If you want something - hey, do not worry, I'll take care of it! Only blink an eye: and I'll hasten to help! Oh, I'm so in love with the Tsar's daughter! - How then will you rescue me, Vanya? - Let me build a flying ship! (King) - Daughter, love?! (Vanya singing) - I don't have much practice speaking of love, Forgive me, if I don't express myself well. - I will only marry the man who can build me a flying ship! - Will you build one? - I'll buy one! (Fun singing) - A small house, a Russian stove. a wooden floor, a bench and a candle. A purring Kitten, a hardworking husband ... Here is happiness. Nothing's sweeter. Oh, if my dream'd come true - What kind of life would then come! Oh, if only this dream'd come true - What kind of life would then begin! (King singing) - I get no support, I must work by myself, To arrange for my daughter a gainful marriage. So that her house would be rich, That is happiness - my son-to-be Polkan. Oh, if my dream'd come true - What kind of life would then come! Oh, if only my dream'd come true - What kind of life would then begin! (Polkan singing) - Imagine me crowned, princess beside me: New land, new glory! New money, new connections... There is happiness - to come from mud to riches! Oh, if my dream'd come true - What kind of life would then come! Oh, if only a dream'd come true - What kind of life would then begin! (Vanya singing) - A small house, a Russian stove, a wooden floor, a bench and a candle. And a house full of children... Here is true happiness! Right, my Zabava? Oh, if my dream'd come true - What kind of life would then come! Oh, if only the dream'd come true - What a life, what a life... What a life, what a life Would then begin! - (All together): - Oh, if only, oh if only! Life would be like a song! Oh, if only, oh if only! Life would be like a song! Oh, if only, oh if only! Life would be like a song! Oh, if only, oh if only! Life would be like a song! - Why're you making noise! - Who are you? - I - am the waterman, the waterman, If only people would talk to me more! Behold my friends: leeches and frogs. Ugh, how disgusting! Oh, my life's a misery! May it drown in this swamp, I live like a toadstool. All I want is to fly, to fly... All I want is to fly! I am the waterman, I am the waterman! Nobody wants to be with me. Inside me is water! Who'd want to be involved? It's disgusting! Oh, my life's a misery! May it drown in this swamp, I live like a toadstool. All I want is to fly, to fly... All I want is to fly... and go for it! - That's what I want to: to fly... - Okay, I'll help you, Vanya! If you can hold these tools in your hands - you will build a flying ship. - Oh! - Oh! - Now some magic words are needed, without them it can't lift off. - Who knows this incantation? - My sisters know. They fly, so they know. Go down this path - it will bring you to them. It's time for me to sleep. (Vanya whistles) (Chorus): - Stretch your bellows, garmoshka - Oh, play with ardor! Sing fun ditties, Baba Yaga! Sing and do not talk! - I was drunk and flying on a broomstick, Though I myself don't believe in these superstitions! - I was walking through the wood - a devil started after me! I thought is was a man! What devilry was this? - I turned back home - the devil was still after me. I spat at his shoulder, and told him to go to hell! - The most mischievous of people is a storyteller, the villain! - A really clever liar. - It's a pity he doesn't taste good! (Chorus): - Stretch your bellows, garmoshka - Oh, play with ardor! Sing fun ditties, Baba Yaga! Sing and do not talk! - To the buckets!! (Chorus) - Earth, farewell! Bon voyage! - Right... "Earth, farewell! Bon voyage!" Stop! Where do you think you're going? That's my ship! - Can you prove it? - I know the magic words, without them it can't fly. - So what are the words? - Earth, farewe- - Farewell to you too! You fool! I have built a flying ship, Now I want my bride. - Oh! - And the ship's mine. What incantation is needed? - Say: "Earth, farewell!" - "Earth, farewell." - And what now? - I fulfilled your heart's desire, Zabavushka. Open, we'll marry now! - Polkan, Polkan! Take me down from here! - I'll give you a ladder, if you give me your crown. - Are you mad? - Your choice. - Ah! I agree! I agree... Oh-oh-oh-oh ... - Open, Zabava, I am now the Tsar! A bargain is a bargain. - Oh! - Zabava! - You're too late, Ivanushka! Polkan built a Flying Ship. - Polkan didn't build it! It was me! Me!! (Knocking) Bon voyage! (Singing): - Ah, in this fairy tale Good won again Though Evil was cunning and clever. Oh, if only that would be always true What kind of life would then be ours! screenplay A.
