By the year 4039, Earth was a scarred and desolate battlefield. Hordes of armored robots created by man in the previous century were sweeping the planet, brutally destroying everything in their path and threatening mankind with extinction. One city attempted to escape their onslaught by unraveling the secrets of time and traveling back in a desperate search for a safer age. They succeeded and time was their friend, until the arrival yet again of their relentless enemy. Search can resume. Negative contact. Search can resume. Negative contact. Search can resume. Negative contact. Search can resume. - Put that out. - I'm going nuts! - You know the orders. No lights. - Christ! Look! Communicator! - My god they're coming again! - Outpost Five! Outpost Five, come in! - What the hell's going on in here, Smith? We're taking hits on the city now, for Christ's sake. Can't you hold a defense perimeter? I've got a repair crew out there and Ballard's with 'em, in case you might've forgotten, what about them? - If we don't hold the Jen-Diki, it's all over anyway. - You've been given a job to do, Smith. Now do it! - Now to extract your black heart. - Break comm-link silence. Order Ballard to return. That's immediate. Well, do it! - City to Rockpool Sector Three. Ballard, wrap it up and bring them in. Bridge order effective immediately. - Rockpool Sector Three to City. - No! Enemy's got our position now. Who's the incompetent running this operation? - It was a bridge order. - I don't give a shit! That ends tonight's broadcast. Now let's move! Prepare for convergence, Sector 5 Perimeter. Repeat, Sector 5 Perimeter. - What did you do? - Nothing. - Now listen! If we don't break through, we're all dead, so don't screw it up! Let's get these tin cans. Go! Go! Wait here! Dino, Olly, Ivan! Up and cover! Turn it around! Pick it up! There's home! Fall back! Come on! Come on! - We're coming in now. Stand by to make the spin. - Power cells aren't anywhere near charged! Now we're done. - Bullshit. - Watch out! Get in there! That's it! Let's spin! - Get me the power engineer. Listen, you dickless amateur. City approaching time travel mode. Reading unauthorized humanoid presence. Proximity in apex is 42776, Sector 5. - Spin, damn it! Dino! Back! Go! Go! - Spin, damn it! Spin! Get up out of there! Losing ground! Get back! Regroup on Level 5! We're all finished if we don't go now! Move along! Move along! Go! They're inside the leg and you arseholes are still debating! - Make the spin! - Order them to hold! We must have half power! - Shut up! - Blow the escape hatch brace! - You can't use that in here! - Watch me. - We're dead if we stay. - Eat this. - It's stuck. - Well, if you say so, then I guess it is. I reckon you'll need a lift. - Oh, I reckon I will. - Where are you headed? - Oh, a few miles. Next town. Midas. Pretty fancy equipment. I bet you say that to all the girls. {Man chuckles) - Don't see that kind of gear much these days. Geologist stuff. - Done some mining, have you? - Oh, this used to be gold country. I've done my share of prospecting. So, uh, geologist... What're you doing out here? - I guess you know a place called Storm Valley? - What about it? - Well, the minerals boys reckon it's a bit of a mystery. So, how do you get to it? - No gold out there. - I'm not looking for gold. - No gold. Burning! Get a repair pod quick! This way! Bring the rest of them over here! - Where are we, Smith? - Traveling back down the line. - Damn it! Why can't anyone do anything right? All drive systems now functional. 4008 traveling. 4003 traveling. - If we hadn't slowed down, we'd have burnt up. There is no cause for alarm. I repeat, climatic control is being reestablished to a comfortable 72 degrees. - What's your name, trooper? - Petra. - You already know my name, right? A lot of my people are out there, face-down in the mud because of what you did. - I hardly think that I'm responsible-- And you could've got us all killed. - I'm sorry. I was glad you were there, that's all. - I'm not concerned with making people glad to see me. - Congratulations, then. You're a big success. I repeat, climatic control is being reestablished to a comfortable 72 degrees. Terminal A-38 is now active. Hello, Ballard, I'm sorry to bother you, but I've received an urgent message from the Committee. Okay, what is it? They are demanding a complete explanation regarding the loss of the Sector 5 support leg number 4771. I'd say you're in big trouble. Thanks a lot. Allow me to summarize. We know they call themselves Jen-Diki. They are apparently, like us, survivors of the last Great Neutron Wars. They buried themselves deep underground to protect themselves from the aftermath. Centuries of living in near-darkness explains their low tolerance to normal light levels. And we know they're cyborgs. Part machine, part human. - This is not a skirmish. It is the whole war. The city must be taken. We must have the city. Every man, woman and child must be killed! Form the trial, follow the city, kill them all! This has to be Midas. Where the streets are paved with gold. Looks friendly enough. - Hey, have a look at that! Wow! - Listen, I warned you jokers about that before. Shut up, you. We know you're hanging out. {Man laughs) - Are they what you're worried about? - How you been, Jake? Long time no see. - I've been prospecting. - Looks like you struck somethin'. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Fill it up, please. Huh? What is it? Look at that. - Thanks for the ride. - Any time. Maybe see you around. - Jeez, I'd rather be under her than this bloody truck. - Right there, Jake. Over here. Who's the tart? - She gave me a lift, Roy. She's gonna be working round here for a while. Geologist or something. - Oh, she is, is she? We'll see about that. - Oh, give her a break, Roy. - I'm going for a leak now, Jake. When I get back, you'll be gone, eh? What the bloody hell's going on here? No chance in this town! Where you hidin', you dead bastards! You mongrel! Where'd you go? - No, no! Hang on, Roy! I'm your mate, remember? No, no! - I don't like you. I don't wanna ever see you around here again. Clear? Very. - It's comin' again. Ain't it, mate? - This time, Jake, keep your bloody mouth shut. - Perhaps first you might tell the Committee why you felt it necessary to cripple the city. - You can't just explain that away. If we tried to put down now if there was an emergency, I shudder to think what would happen. - If Ballard hadn't done what he did, we'd still be back there with our throats torn out. Now, a new leg could be made. In fact, I hope one is actually being made? - Ellison? - Three weeks. I don't know, I'll get back to you on that. - What I want to know is where do they come from? - These things have ambushed us five times now and each time, we lose more people, sustain more damage! We have to think of the city. It is our responsibility! - I've got something to say. - It had better be good. - I know where they come from, and I know what they want. It's disgusting. - These look like medallions, ornaments. In fact, they're a communications device. The heart of the beast. They were human once, but now they're more machine. Zuryk, the leader of the Jen-Diki. They track our every move in time. They use a triangular force field of immense power, burst through time and wait for us to appear. We've always thought we were the only living beings left on the planet. Well, I've got news for you. We weren't. - No. - That's not true. - Everyone knows we're the last city left-- - A dozen cities could've survived the poisons, the wars, even gone on the line like we did. We'll never know, because the Jen-Diki are raiders of cities. - You mean pirates? - Surely not. - I was right! - And what do they want? - Power. Shelter. The city and everything in it. - What you're saying is that there's no hope? We're doomed? - No. We fight them. - What with? It's three centuries since the city had a real army! Needed one. Sidearms and a handful of pulse guns won't stop these things. - The classic male answer to everything. Pick up guns and kill one another. - These aren't plumbers you can bribe to get your bathroom fixed overnight, lady, they kill to live. - So what exactly are you suggesting, Mr. Ballard? - Stand and fight. Sure, we need neutron cannons like in the old days, but we'll go with what we have. We don't have a choice. Do we? - Hold on! You can't take those. - Why not? - You don't know anything, do you? 20th century only had steel. Plain steel. Avoid contact with the locals. Let the Cultural Officer make all the arrangements. - No. - Petra's our 20th century expert. - Expert! - She goes. That's from the Committee. - I don't like it any better than you do. - Here. Take this. - What is it? - Money. - He's a throwback. A neanderthal. - If it were up to me, the Committee bought his scheme, let him try to make it work, then choke on it. - Ballard, my friend! Going somewhere? - A little trip. You know Dr. Sun-Wah. Wisest man in the city. - Forgive him! He had a crude upbringing. - Right here, since I was a kid hoarding this place. You were my education. - Unfortunately. Master craftsman cannot forge sharp sword from poor steel! - Hah. - Let's get on with it! {Machinery hums) - The arm bands! Only trigger them at the very last possible moment! - Mr. Smith, stand back, please! Unless you wish to join your ancestors in the past. - Just so we understand each other, mister. The moment that circuit closes, I'm in charge. - The hell you are! - The Time Guardian. They're moving again. - G'day, misses. - Where is your clan? - Nobody else. Only us. - Well, what about the ritual? - Still got the spear. We could do it right now, if you'd like. Cut hand and my blood. Are you expecting trouble? - Oh, people like him always expect the worst. - And we're usually right. They must've tracked us. Come on, we've gotta find the spheres. - Our time has come. Prime the time spheres. Stand by to break through. - Holy Jesus. - Come on! They're coming through! Push it over! - Help him! - Something's happened! - It's moving! - They have broken the field. I think we stopped most of 'em. How bad is it? - Pretty stupid, huh? - Yeah. But thanks. Danny? Take her back to the pool. Stay with her, all right? - Regroup underground and wait for night. Set the sentries. Help, please! Help! - Don't make a sound, and I won't hurt you. Quiet, please. - Let go of me! What was that? - It's a bit hard to explain. - It looked like-- - Take it easy. - Who the hell are you? - My name's Ballard, sorry. - Keep away from me. - Look, it's all right. I'm trying to protect you. - How do I know that? I'm getting out of here. - Not such a good idea. You're a lot safer with me. - Really? - Really. Come on, let's go. I've got a friend up there who's injured. And I could use some help. What do you want me to do? - Know anything about healing? - Boost it a bit, please. - What? The red button. Press it down for a count of three. - What happened to you? - Jen-Diki ambush. Who are you? Where's Ballard? He must be loving this. - That thing was a Jen-Diki? - How is she? - She ought to see a doctor. - We can't draw attention to ourselves. - You've hardly blended into the landscape, have you? If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to tell me what's going on. And you can start with that bangle. - What? - The armband thing. When I pressed the button, it put her to sleep. - It does a lot more than that. - Tell her, Ballard. Tell her! We're gonna need her. - Okay. I need to get hold of an earth transposer. - A what? - He means an earth mover. He doesn't know much about this century, does he? - An earth mover? Well, there might be one in Midas. - Can you take me there? Please? - Yeah. Sure, I can take you. But after that, you're on your own. - Okay. Let's go. I'll be back as fast as I can. - So you still haven't told me anything. - You'll find it hard to believe. - Try me. - What's your name? - Annie. - All right, Annie. I come from the future. From a city that travels in time. And we can choose what timezone we want to appear in. - You're right. This is gonna be very hard to believe. - All right, then forget it. Just take me to town. - Hang on! I wanna hear more! - What's the point? - Oh, come on! You've gotta admit that's a fair bit to swallow. Where is this city? - Right now it should be around the end of the 32nd century. It's coming back in time. - Back to where? - Here. It'll arrive in the valley tomorrow night. So how come you're not on it? We were sent ahead. We've got some repair work to do. With an earth transposer, right? Mm. One of the support legs of the city was damaged in a battle with the Jen-Diki. I've gotta build a rock mound to prop it up. That's a hell of a story. Yeah, it is. Will you help me? - I'm thinking about it. The first page. Does the city look something like that? - Where did you get this? - So you have been here before. - Answer me! - Calm down! I made the drawing from some rock paintings. Some very old rock paintings. Did you think I was a spy or something? You've been reading too much science fiction. - Too much what? Sorry I gave you a fright this morning. So am I. The Jen-Diki might have heard us. - Where are they now? - Underground. We'll be safe till after dark. They're light sensitive. - These Jen-Diki, are they human? - Only by a stretch of the imagination. - And what about you? Are you human? - Back up the line, they're still discussing that. What's this? Oh, god. He's dead. Electrocution. - Well, we'll have to take him with us and hand him in. - Who to? - The police, I suppose. - Shit. Well, come on then. Give us a hand. - Yeah, all right. Don't! - Bloody hell! Counihan! - Listen, it's not what you think. - One move from you, shit for brains, and I'll splatter-- Hey, wait a minute! This is getting-- - That goes for you, too. - Be very careful, son. I'm a nervous kind of fellow at the best of times. You ain't gonna give me any of that kung-fu shit, are you, son? - Never crossed my mind. - Sweet. - Look in the back, Ernie. - Old mate of yours, eh, Roy? I think we better go inside and get this down on paper. - What do you want me to do about him? - You knew him better than me, Roy! Name of deceased. Counihan. Wally. - Cheap bastard. - So where is he? Gonna have to bury him fast, this time of year. - I've got nothing to hold you on. Get out. - You, you jackass. You made out you ran this town. You couldn't run a hot bath. - Didn't think you'd let them go, Sarge. - They're not going anywhere, Roy. I've just got 'em on a longer leash. - I'll get what you need. Wait there. And keep your hands off the locals, okay? - Whatever you say. Annie. Your damn Committee wants the whole plan to fall down, that's why-- - The Committee accepted the plan which was put to it! Under article 14-- - Article bullshit! You know as well as I do, we should be down there with him! - Look, it's a low-profile operation. They don't want a dozen flatfooted troopers-- - We're trying to fight Jen-Diki! What if something goes wrong? - Oh, nothing will go wrong! We're relying on standard-- - You're relying on luck, Smith. - Now listen here, trooper! You're out of line on this! Any more and you'll find yourself on a disciplinary charge! - I wouldn't give you the pleasure. - That's an earth mover? - It'll do the job. I'll do the talking. No, I will. - Have it your way. Ballard? You have to tell me. What really happens when the city lands? I want an answer. You're getting ready to fight these Jen-Diki. What happens to us? The town? - There's gonna be battle, out there, soon. Maybe here, too. And it could alter history. That's the future, as well as the past. Listen. It's what happens now that shapes history. What we do. - We're closed. - Got an urgent job for that. Thought we could do a deal. - What sort of deal? We're talking big bucks here. You got big bucks? How much? - Depends. How long you want it? Two days. - Two days. 2,000. Take it or leave it. - 2,0007? All right. But I don't have it just now. I can give it to you the day after tomorrow. What happens then? - Some friends of mine arrive. You can trust me. - 2,000 is it? Day after tomorrow? You take credit cards, don't you? - Cash. Changed your mind? How am I doing, Annie? - I can't sleep. My head's too full. You can get some rest. I'll stay here and watch. - No. I want to be ready if they come. But I don't think we'll see them tonight. How's Petra? - She's talking in her sleep. Sounds like she's having an argument with a guy called Smith, I think. That's a good sign. I think she's healing. - Tell me more, Ballard. - About the city? - Yeah. - You'd be amazed. The technology's enormous. We've got powers your time only dreams about. - No. I mean the people. Are they different? - They still fight and squabble. And try very hard to outdo each other. I guess they're not very different. - And what about men and women? - They fall in and out of love. Marry and divorce. Argue over the children. What? I'm pleased. - Why? - I guess you people are human after all. - Is he still at it? - Uh-huh. He never stops. - I learned that the hard way. You'd have to say he's a bit heavy-handed. - Well, the men where I come from are not much of a bargain. - They're not much better here. - Ballard's about the best of 'em. Unfortunately, he also knows this. - So tell me something about him. You must've done some homework. - Well, let's see. The city picked him up early in the fourth millennium. He was, what do you call it? A feral child? Living with a band of nomads. His parents, family, wiped out. One of the city's engineers brought him up. Dr. Sun. He's one of the best. He's never been one of us, really. It's a shame. Is there any more of that? - Yeah, sure. - He needs your help. With this, you can give it to him. - But you need it. Besides, I don't know anything about how to use it. - I'll show you. It's not much. We just like to make it sound complicated. - Tell me the truth, Sun. Do you think the city will hold together until we spin down? - It has held for 500 years. And it will hold for another day. Only, I ask, has anything been heard from Ballard? - That's none of your concern! - No, no, we haven't, but we didn't expect to. But... Thank you, Sun. When this is set up that's as much as we can do. - Great. I'm going for a swim! You're going to jump in and save me when this thing electrocutes me, aren't you? What's your world like, Ballard? What do you do with yourself when you're off duty? - You'll have to wait and see. Ballard? - Rafferty! Tucker, have you seen Rafferty? - Not since this mornin', Sarge. - Don't slack off. Hi. - Been swimming? Did you learn something about the 20th century? - Hm. Right now, I should be thinking about getting us home. - Hm. She'll get you there. - We'll all get each other there. - What is it? - Something's wrong. Charge pack's losing power. We're gonna need a backup, something with punch. - A gun? I know where we can find one. Not there. Ah, right. These guys, they always have one. - Hm. Oh, ammo! - This what you want? Get 'em up! Something to remember, eh? Scum always rises to the surface. All you gotta do is be patient and scoop it up. {Machinery hums) - Bridge. Oh, what do you want? I want to speak to the boss. It is very important! - He's busy. We're all busy! - You must listen! The city we have to fight. There is a way we can overcome! - Sure there is. You can let us get on with our jobs. - We have the power! It is in the timeline! The power that drives us can defeat them! - In the timeline? Are you mad? - Listen! The beam accelerator controls the power. If we can remove it from the line... - Listen, old man. The best brains in the city are working on this. Do you expect me to listen to some bullshit theory? Oh, I haven't time for this nonsense. If you're so convinced, you get it out. - I can try. - You frisked the girl? - No. - Then get into it. - You'll be all right, love. Hey, Sarge! Look at this! Fancy-lookin' bugger. - Take it off, girlie. - She can't! Leave it! - Bring her over here. - No! She doesn't know how to remove it. - Then you take it off. - Ballard, don't do it. - I don't have a choice. - Now yours. No! - What are these things, son? You wouldn't understand, McCarthy. Just leave it alone. - Oh, take a rest. If you screw up the settings on those armbands, your damn town's gonna end up being history. Now, now. - You don't know what you're doing! - Is that so? Shit! - Ballard! The Time Guardian who has run out of time. J Lost my girl J J She's gone away J J And I don't know ♪ J What I'm gonna do today [ Hm? - McCarthy. - Sarge, it's me, Wayne! I'm at the yard, help me! There's somebody... - Have you got anything to tell me? - Give me those armbands and I might be able to save you. - Oh, don't do me any favors, son. - That way! Get out if you can! Go! - Wayne? You there? Damn it. - Wayne? Holy shit. Jesus Christ! - Let's get out of here! Freeze! - Get down! Not a move! - Remember me, McCarthy? You wouldn't bloody listen, would ya? Now watch your town burn. - We'll take this. - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Knock it over. - Petra? - Over here. You're cutting it pretty close. I thought you'd decided to stay. - No way. - How do you feel? Do you think you can make it? - Sure. We have to be down there when the city stops. - Annie. When the city lands, the Jen-Diki will attack in force. Now, we fought a few of them off, but this time-- - Ballard. - Look. All I'm saying is this is your last chance to go back. - Ballard, I know what you're saying. I'm coming. - For more than 500 years, this city has been our mother. It is not just our fate that lies in the balance, but that of all humanity. - No! - Oh, no! - Petra. - Move, move, move it! Ballard! - Ballard! You're next, Guardian! Nothing can stop us! - It's not over yet. - Hey, boss! Welcome back. Are you all right, boss? Come on back, come on back. Fall back! Olly, Gracie, fall back! Come on! Come on, move! - Victory is ours! - How do we stand, Ivan? - Not good. We are outnumbered. Here. Take this. - Round here. - Ballard! My son. - Sun! Oh, no. You old fool. Let's get him inside! - Ballard. Listen to me. The city needs you. - What do you mean? - Do you remember the stories I told you? - Yes. - Take the beam accelerator from the line. Remember your training! The test of courage! - Take care of him, please. Hang on, old man. I'll be back. - They've broken through. The scanners are reporting. They're in the city. We're fully committed. There are no more reserves. - At last, Guardian. The city will be mine, but you won't live to see it. It is over, Ballard. - I reckon you need me, Ballard. - Fall back! Fall back! - Stop the fighting. Stop the fighting now. You can no longer win, Jen-Diki. Zuryk is dead. The war is over. You've tracked us across the centuries to try to destroy us, and take what we have. It's the power of this city that you want. Well, I'm here to give it to you. You'll be trapped within its force forever. Here's 500 years of power. All at once. I thought I might find you here. - Sometimes it seems like a dream. Monsters, battles. The city. A week ago, I was a geologist out in the middle of nowhere. You like it? I hear it's the latest thing. - You look fabulous. Commander Ballard, you're required on the bridge. Respond please, Commander. - They'll want a full report. I should go. - They can wait. Let the city run itself.
