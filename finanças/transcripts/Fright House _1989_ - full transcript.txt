(drums beating) - The house scares me. - Oh come on, Vincent Mansion's been empty for years. It's willed to a college fraternity. But, since it's being contested, we're all alone. (upbeat rock music) Delissa, would you marry me? (Delissa gasps) - [Delissa] Oh, Les! - [Les] I love you. - [Delissa] I love you, honey. ♫ All of the time ♫ I tried to find ♫ Meetings of feelings ♫ I left in my mind ♫ One day I'll find ♫ One day at a time ♫ Sweet Jesus won't help you ♫ When you try to hide ♫ Love falls like rain ♫ Down my windowpane ♫ Saying the same things ♫ Again and again ♫ One day I'll find ♫ The key that's unwise ♫ All of these feelings ♫ Are tucked in my mind ♫ And the uproar starts ♫ I gave you all of my love ♫ I'll show you what you must do ♫ Love left to hide ♫ Left the room so strained ♫ So I heard today ♫ Follow me and I'll show you ♫ What you must say ♫ Falling like sand ♫ Through my guiding hands ♫ The love that you want ♫ Is just to follow the bland ♫ And the uproar starts (ominous music) (fire roaring) (eerie groaning) - [Brian] Doctor? Doctor? It's Brian. Damn. I must be in the wrong wing of the basement. (door creaking) (eerie howling) (paramedics talking quietly) - [Tara] The body? - It's never a pretty sight when someone slashes their own wrist. - [Tara] What was doing by an outdoor fireplace on Vincent's property anyway? - [Les] Yeah that is kind of strange. What's strange too is that this kid supposedly sliced his own wrist. What's he doing with the wound on the back of his head? - [Tara] Maybe he got it when he fell. - [Les] Eh. So what I want you to do, I think I want you to go undercover at the college. Make out like you're a student. See what you can find out. - [Tara] Okay. (Carl sighs) - Hello, Father Callahan? This is Carl Morane. Fine, thanks. Listen, Father, remember that event I was predicting to you? Well, I'm closer to predicting the exact time. What should we do about it? Drop it? Father, I can't drop it. Just because you're superstitious, Father, is no reason I should fear it too. I want to warn the people, Father. Hello? Father? Damn, he hung up. (sighs) (ominous music) (eerie groaning) - What is it, my child? (eerie groaning) Come, come. Only by your confidence can we destroy the power of darkness. (eerie groaning) (gasping) - [Eerie Voice] Powerful... (Carl sighs) (phone ringing) - Hello? Hey Carl. How you doing? What's up? Yeah, just watching some TV with Delissa. Yeah sure I can meet you, no problem. When? Tomorrow? Yeah, okay. Where do you want me to meet you? At the Vincent Mansion? Sure, no problem. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Wait, the Vincent Mansion? What... Why would he want me to meet him at the Vincent Mansion? Of all places? (ominous music) (leaves rustling) (gasps) (Les laughs) Always a little genius, huh? Hey, what are you doing hanging around up here anyway? Don't you know all kind of shit's been going on around here? - What do you mean? - What do I mean? Carl. You gotta lighten up on the books. Don't you know they just found another kid from your college up here, that just killed himself? - [Carl] Brian. - You knew him? Tall, long-haired kid? - Yeah, he was in my therapy group. - Hey, how's that going anyway? You know, you're looking pretty good. - Yeah. Victoria's helped me a lot. - Victoria? (chuckles) Don't you mean Dr. Sedgewick? - Come on, you know how it is. - No, I don't. Why don't you tell me about it? - I like her. (Les chuckles) She kind of like, gets me going. - Hey, that's great. So, what's the urgency? - I'm glad you came. You know, even though others have branded me as being a little off-center, you're always ready to listen. - To listen? Well let me talk a little sense into that overstuffed skull of yours. You know, every time I think of our last family's Sunday dinner with Aunt Flo, and the look on her face when you started talking about disembodied spirits, and realizing ones in our consciousness, remember she almost dropped her false teeth into mom's antipasto? - Is everything a joke to you? - Oh sure, remember when you told Uncle Joe and Donny that they both, like, came from the same cosmic egg or something? Does that mean they're both chickenshit? (Les laughing) - Yeah, I was only four years old, that's it. - I remember. - Anyway, look at these aspects. Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune conjunct into Earth's side, while Mars opposes Pluto-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Carl, please repeat that again, only in English this time, all right? - Horace Vincent, owner of this place, supposedly died in a boating accident. Pluto is the God of Hades. In this configuration, the Gates of Hell could literally burst open. And the gate is here. All this will take place any day now. (Les laughs) - Carl, all's I know from Pluto is that he's Mickey Mouse's dog. Hey look. The scientific community might love your theory, but guarantee, Captain Levi in my precinct will have me out on psychiatric disability, if not in a strait jacket, if I went back to him with that story. Hey listen, it's just not something that you can go back to people with and warn 'em and expect 'em to take you seriously. - More time. More research. More answers. - You know, for a genius, sometimes I think you're going mad. Hey I gotta get going kid, I'm on duty in an hour. I'll see you at Sunday dinner, okay? (Les laughing) (ominous music) (gasping) (bell tolling) - You got my deepest sympathies, Les. I didn't know your brother, but I'm sure he must have been a great guy. You just, you can't go around blaming yourself. I mean, you know, just because he took his own life... I mean, I knew, I know exactly how you feel. I do. Just... My own son Danny died the same way, couple of years ago. - Thank you, Captain. - Will you look at that? I mean, how could anybody in this town, I mean, how could anybody in God, devil's name do something like that? - It's that long-haired kid's grave. You know, the one we found dead? Someone desecrated his grave, they dug it up, and the body's gone. I need to spend a little time alone. - Okay. - I'm gonna take a little walk, okay? - Okay, sweetheart. I'm gonna go spend some time in the chapel. - [Les] Okay. (ominous music) (eerie groaning) (dog growling) (dramatic music) (eerie groaning) - [Eerie Voice] Delissa... Come... Come... Delissa... (Delissa screaming) - Take it easy, take it easy, it's all right. Calm down. (eerie groaning) (Les screaming) - What? Honey? What? Oh baby, you're just having a nightmare. Honey? Honey, you're just having a nightmare. It's okay. Oh baby, you're just stressed about the funeral yesterday. It's okay. It's okay. Go back to sleep. It's okay. - Delissa, please, I can't be bothered with these petty concerns. The ring and the flowers and where's Aunt Lois gonna sit? Who gives a shit? - Who gives a shit? This is our wedding you're talking about. What do you mean who gives a shit? (Les sighs) It's only in a few months, and you wanna call the whole thing off? - No, I don't want to call it off. Just, I've got more important things on my mind right now, all right? - What could be more important than our wedding? - My brother's murder! - Suicide, damn it! Your brother committed suicide. And you've gotta start getting over it. Look at you, what are you doing? - I'm doing my job, I'm a detective, remember? - Stop it! Stop it! I can't stand this fighting! I think you need to talk to somebody. (Les sighs) Our lives are falling apart. I asked around discreetly... And I got the name of a doctor. - A doctor? What kind of a doctor? - She's a psychiatrist. - Oh, great. Well that'll just solve everything. It certainly did wonders for Carl's problems. - I loved Carl too! But honestly, you know he was seeing that psychiatrist because he was very depressed. He'd become so disturbed. - Oh, you mean like I'm disturbed, right? You know, maybe you shouldn't marry into this family anyway. After all, according to you, we're all raving lunatics. - I didn't say you were crazy. You're just obsessing over Carl's death. Come on. Hold me... I think we should see Dr. Sedgewick. - Dr. Sedgewick. Isn't she the consultant over at the college? - I don't know. - Yeah. Yeah, she was the one Carl was seeing. He was really up on her. I think I will go see her. As a matter of fact, I think she was treating all these kids. Yeah, she was. - Oh, hello. Hi, is this Delissa? Oh, well this is Captain Levi. Yeah. Yeah, that's right, Les' boss, yeah. Well, how are ya? Good, good, that's good. Listen, Delissa, you know, I'm a little bit worried about Les. Yeah, that, that's right, I know he's been obsessed, you know, about his brother's death but, look, I have checked it all out. I mean, I checked out the mansion, the school chaplain, you know, yeah, that old fella, the priest, right, right. I talked to all these students at the college and, you know, I still think, you know, there's too much obsession with that, you know, and I think you and I oughta meet and discuss this here. I mean, for, for his sake. You agree, huh? Okay, that's good. Look, uh, what about, let me see, uh, you know the old Vincent place? Oh, you don't have to be concerned. (chuckles) I mean, you're gonna be with the strong arm of the law. I'm gonna be there. Yeah. Now how about this evening? Good, good, say about uh, 7:00 pm? Fine, fine. Yeah. I'll see you later. (humming) To you, my beautiful lady. Mmm. (chuckles evilly) (upbeat rock music) (students chattering) - I was terribly sorry to hear about Carl, detective. He was improving so nicely. I do hope you received the flowers I sent? - Yes. Thank you. I could see why Carl was so infatuated with you. He even called you Victoria. (Victoria chuckles) - I allow all my students to call me Victoria, detective. You see, I'm only eight to 10 years older than most of them. I also feel that it promotes a more relaxed attitude. I am curious however as to why you're here. - It's quite simple, doctor. I'm here on an official capacity. I'm here to investigate Carl's murder. - Murder? - Yes, murder. Carl didn't slice his own wrists. Why should he? You said it yourself, he was recovering so well. And he couldn't stop talking about you. - Detective, psychiatry is not a precise science. I was obviously wrong. - I don't think so. As a matter of fact, what I do think is that you know a lot more than you're telling me. (slow rock music) Oh, Victoria... Yes... ♫ Hey girl, can I face you ♫ I know that I'm wide awake - Detective? Detective? - [Les] Oh. - If that will be all, I do have patients I have to see. - Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get worked up like that. I've been under a lot of stress lately and uh, I guess we're done. We can talk more about this another time. Thanks a lot for seeing me. Thank you, Victoria. - Thank you, Les. (students laughing) - All right, let's talk about classes, okay? Can we talk? All right, classes, interesting classes. I took a dream analysis class. That was my favorite, last term. I was sleeping a lot. In fact, toward the end of the term, I was sleeping more and more. The last week of classes, is everyone still awake? (students laughing) The last week of classes, I was sleeping 18 hours a day. When I was asked why I was doing that, I said, "I'm cramming for my finals." (students laughing) Uh, the cafeteria here is really bad. The food is really bad here. - [Students] How bad is it? - It's so bad, that I was eating here for three months before I found out burnt wasn't a flavor. (students laughing) It was so bad that I chipped a tooth on the gravy. (frat brothers shouting) - [Stan] Don't do it, don't do it! Somebody stop him, he's trying to kill himself! - [Jerry] Get away from me! I got it, I got it bad, man! Get away from me, leave me alone! - We want to help you! We're your fraternity brothers, Jerry! We're your fraternity brothers! Don't, don't do it, we wanna help you! - [Jerry] No, it's bad! It's bad, man! - Come on, come on, Jerry! - No, no! - [Stan] Come on Jerry! (Jerry grunting) - Leave me alone! - Jerry! - It's bad! It's really bad! - [Stan] I'm your friend, I want to help! - No! - Let me, come on! - No! No, no, no! I'll kill myself! I am! It's too bad! It's bad! No, I can't take anymore, it's bad! It's really bad! I'm gonna kill myself, man! I'm gonna kill myself! - Don't do it, Jerry! (Jerry groaning) Don't do it! (Jerry screaming) Why'd you do it? Things aren't that bad! - Not bad? You call this not bad? Any self-respecting frat can't live with fingernails like this! I didn't get a manicure! It's bad! It's bad! - No man, that's bad, Jerry. - That's bad. - It's bad, yeah. - It's bad, it's bad. It's bad. (Jerry laughing) ♫ We're bad, we're bad ♫ You know it, you know it ♫ We're bad - Fraternity jackasses! - Who's bad? - [Frat Brothers] Psi Omega! - All right! (whooping and laughing) - I can't believe those guys. What assholes! - You guys think that's funny? - That's Carl Morane's brother. - Come on, you think student suicide is something for fun and games? Something to laugh about? - [Stan] Come on man, we're only having a little fun. No harm done, man. - Well it's not funny. So cool it out. - [Stan] Okay. - Great joke, guys. Real great joke. (all chattering) - Real funny, real funny. - [Stan] Come on, come on, Melissa. - You know what-- (scoffs) - I just can't take those goddamn college kids. They're driving me crazy. - (Sighs) come on. You gotta toughen up, rookie. - Yeah? You don't look too tough yourself right now. - Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm just a little concerned over all these suicides. Besides the fact my girlfriend just took off on me. - Jesus. - Without a word. I don't know, she probably went off to her mother's, I guess. Anyway, what about this? Anything happening here? - Nothing new. Look, Les. If, if you're so sure something's going on with these suicides, then why don't, why don't you let me do something more active? I can't help much snooping around these college kids. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down. Now you're new at this, don't forget that. This isn't police school. This is the real world. You try to bite off too much too quickly, something out of the ordinary happens, it could turn you into a whimpering baby, Tara. - Whimpering baby? I, I just want to do more. - Did you hear the news? - [Frat Brother] No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell us. - The old Vincent Mansion's been willed to the frat. (frat brothers cheering) - Wait a minute, guys. Isn't that off limits? - Oh come on! - Jeez. - [Stan] Get real. - Come on, I think we should wait for Jeff. - [Stan] No way! Come on, let's go now. - [Melissa] I really do! - [Stan] Go get him, okay? - You know, something about that old place, the Vincent Mansion? Uh, I don't know, the Captain just wants to stay out of there. I don't understand. You wanna do something? - Yeah. - Why don't you go over there? Now stay outta sight. - Okay. - And see what you can find out. I think I'm gonna go have a heart-to-heart with the Captain. You give me a call later. - Okay. (Les sighs) (suspenseful music) - [Disembodied Voice] Don't even think of escaping, Delissa. Our master has great plans for you. Come. It's time for more preparation. - Captain! Captain! Slow down! Come on, you gotta listen to me! - Oh come on now, look, Les, listen to me. Kid look, look. You're a detective, aren't you? - Yeah. - And detectives, they've gotta deal with reality, with facts. - I'm convinced he didn't kill himself. Why won't you back me on this one? - Oh now look, Les, look. When my son Danny committed suicide two years ago, I thought my world had ended, now, right? I mean now, two years later, my wife has still got Danny's jacket hanging in the closet, and his music is still playin', his dog Bosco is still waitin' (chuckles) I mean, my house is a mausoleum. - Look, come on, they were all found with their wrists slashed. Are you gonna tell me that's a coincidence? - Coincidence? (laughs) No, no coincidence. I mean it's, it's a possible suicide pact, you know, with that damn fraternity they all belong to. Let me tell ya something. That frat house should have a slogan that says, "Join now, and die later." (laughs) - You know Captain, your attitude just runs chills down my spine. You're ridiculous. - Hey, hey, now wait a minute. Now just a minute, Les. This happens to be a dirty job, and you're not with it. - [Police Dispatch] Excuse me, calling Captain Levi? - Oh uh, by the way Les, for the next three months, you are behind the desk. - What? - And not on the street. And that is an order. - No, no, you can't do that. - I can't? (laughing) Hey, look, this is not a democracy. I am still the boss, kiddo. (laughs) "Oh, you can't do that." My wife says you can't do that. I can't do this, I can't do that. What can I do? Well I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I am gonna go home, that's what I'm gonna do. - I can't believe him. (ominous music) (eerie groaning) (eerie music) (raspy groaning) (Tara gasping) (Tara screaming) - Please, please, don't do this to me, I promise, I promise I won't tell anyone! Please, please! (screaming) - [Frat Brother] Hey, go Stan! - [Stan] Now take it easy guys, I'm gonna get in there. - [Frat Brother] It's cool, man. You can do it. Aw, yeah. Hey, all right. Come on man. (laughing) Come on, Stan. Hey don't stand around. Hey will you stop that, man? (door unlatching) - [Frat Brother] All right, good job, Stan. We got in, really. Come on in guys. - [Lori] Oh wow! - [Frat Brother] Everybody hold on. You guys know we're doing this on the lam, right? - Yeah. - Let's be cool. - [Lori] All right, we'll be cool, we'll be cool. - [Frat Brother] Check it out, all right. (college kids talking excitedly) (cult members chanting in foreign language) (college kids talking excitedly) - [Lori] Not another door. Stan? Come on, Stan the man! (college kids whooping and cheering) - [Frat Brother] Come on man. - [Stan] Wow, look at this place! - [Melissa] Did anyone die here? - [Jeff] No one died here. (cult members chanting in foreign language) (college kids talking excitedly) - [Jeff] This is what we wanted. These windows must be worth a fortune. - [Lori] Can you believe it? Wow. How beauitufl. This is beautiful, this is like my living room. - [Stan] Yeah sure, you bet. (ominous music) - Bequeathed to us of the will of the honorable Horace Vincent. You've heard the story before, haven't you? - [Melissa] No. - Well, Horace Vincent was this weird old dude who was the leader of this bizarre religious cult. (Stan imitating eerie music) He wasn't such a bad guy though. I mean at one time, he was president of Psi Kappa Beta. Anyway, the older he got, the weirder he got. And then, he totally lost it when his two sons were killed in what the police called a hunting accident. - [Lori] Oh my goodness, guys. - Their bodies were found with huge claw marks all over them. - (Chuckles) Ew! (cult members chanting in foreign language) - My dad was good friends with Father Callahan. He was the priest that wouldn't bury Brian because of his suicide. Oh... - You got a big mouth. - [Stan] I'm, I'm sorry, Melissa. - It's okay, Stan. It's okay. He's been dead for six months. I'll never forget him. Or the way he was found. - [Short-Haired Girl] What about Father Callahan, Stan? - Yeah, well, he told my dad that old man Vincent called one night, some kind of, somebody hysterical asking him about a exorcism for this place. - [Melissa] An exorcism? - [Jeff] Well you could exorcise me anytime, baby. (college kids talking excitedly) Hey have a good time, guys. (cult members chanting in foreign language) - [Les] This is for murdering my partner, you piece of garbage! How does that feel? (cult member groaning) - [Pete] Too cool man, I'm serious. - [Lori] Beautiful. - Ooh. - Cut it out! - [Pete] I think there's a bed up here somewhere. - [Lori] There are no beds here, wake up. Look how beautiful this place is. Let's check it out. - [Pete] Oh yeah, you asked pretty darn well. (Delissa shrieking) (zombies groaning) (ominous music) (Delissa whimpering) - [Frat Brother] Stan! Jeff! Jeff? (college kids laughing) - [Girl In Red Sweater] Oh guys, we should go back. - [Short-Haired Girl] Come on, I'm really getting scared here. - Yeah, come on-- - Shh, shh, shh, quiet, quiet. Who farted? (college kids laughing) Come on. - [Short-Haired Girl] Hey I don't see any lights. Can we leave now? - [Frat Brother] Stan, he said he was gonna meet me right here. Come on, it's okay. Shh, shh, quiet, quiet. Hey, think we can get in there? - [Girl In Red Sweater] I don't think we should go in there. - [Frat Brother] Why? Stan told me to meet him here, we'll just wait. - [Girl In Red Sweater] Come on, maybe we should go back. - [Delissa] Oh my God, help! (Delissa screaming) Oh God, help! - [Frat Brother] Are you all right? Hey, hey, hey! Jeez, calm down, calm down! (Delissa screaming) (college kids talking excitedly) - Hey, shh, shh, shh! - Zombies! - [Girl In Red Sweater] Hey cut it out, what are you talking about? - [Frat Brother] What are those sounds? (zombies growling) (college kids screaming) - [Delissa] No, oh my God! (Delissa screaming) (zombies growling) (Delissa whimpering) (cult members chanting in foreign language) - Les said that they studied certain monolithic sites, to find out why the ancient people had built on them. - [Jeff] I'm sorry Melissa, but what's the connection to Brian? - The pendant. One like this was found on Carl Morane's body too. - Shit. It doesn't sound like a coincidence. - Les Morane didn't think so either. (cult members chanting in foreign language) - [Eerie Voice] Delissa! - Let's go. - What was that? - What was that? - Sounds like someone's having as much fun as us, baby. - That seems like something serious. Maybe we should look? - Come on, baby. - No, I'm gonna go. I'll be right back. - [Jeff] What? (Melissa gasping) - Don't touch it! It's the same as this. - I hate to break this to you guys, but something very weird is going on here. - Let's get out of here! - No, we've gotta find Pete and Lori! - Come on, let's go find them. (all screaming) - Did you scream? - No, I thought it was you guys! - Where's Pete? - I left him in one of the bedrooms! - Oh my God! - Go! (cult members chanting in foreign language) - Come on! Oh brother! Hold on, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lori, if you didn't scream, and Pete didn't scream, who screamed? - I don't know. - Let's just get Pete and get out of here! - [Girl In Red Sweater] How do we get out of here? - Same way we came in. All of the other windows and doors are locked. - (Scoffs) Does anybody remember where we came in? - No. - Let's go. (eerie groaning) (cult members chanting in foreign language) (Lori gasping) - Intruders! They have defiled the ceremony! Kill them, they must not leave here alive! - [Jeff] Run! - Bring her to me! We must have another sacrifice, or our master will kill us! (Melissa screams) (suspenseful music) - Pete! My God, we've gotta get out of here, there's a, Pete? Pete? (screaming) (whimpering) (screaming) (zombie growling) (screaming) (cult member groaning) (Melissa screaming) - Hey, it's all right, I'm Detective Morane. Carl's brother, remember? Let's meet your friends downstairs. I'm gonna take you to them, okay? Okay come on, let's go. Don't be afraid Melissa, I'm not one of them. I'm just dressed like this because I wanted to see what's going on around here. Come with me, I think Jeff's found a safe place. Come on. - They're over here, I found a place to hide. What do you think? (ominous music) (all screaming) - Goodness! A man of his station! A visit from the blessed mother! Come to me immediately! Come to save my soul! - [Jeff] Who are you? - Who am I? You invade my castle, and you ask who I am? I am Horace Vincent, ex-apprentice of Lucifer. Newly appointed apprentice of Christ. Come to blessed mother. - [Jeff] Are you one of them? I don't understand. What are you doing here? - [Horace] I'm living my benefactor. Your pursuers, they came for my soul, my son's, my mansion I built for them to hide in. They gave me great wealth. And I discovered a way to cheat them. I discovered the great crystal. They cannot come near it. Tonight is their night of sacrifice, and you're helpless. Without this crystal, you are all doomed. Your only hope is to get to the others. And then take the crystal. But you must stay in until the sunrise. - [Victoria] Allison. - My lady. - It's the old man. - Yes. I'm afraid he's complicated things further. He's with the intruders. And we can't go in there, because of the crystal. - Yes. But he doesn't have it now. I've been waiting a long time to get him for our master. But first my love, I need you. Without the sacrifice, how will we get him? - No. It'll kill me! - You all belong to me now. And I shall possess you. (Allison screaming) (Victoria laughing) (Horace screaming) - [Melissa] Wait, this is the wrong way. - [Les] No, I don't think so. - [Melissa] No, it's definitely this way. Come on. (Melissa screaming) (swords clanging) - [Les] Jeff, quick, go get her! (girl in red sweater screaming) (Les grunting) (cult member groaning) Jeff? - I told you to take her and prepare her for the sacrifice. Jeff... I know it's you. - [Jeff] Dr. Sedgewick? - Victoria, Jeff. (laughing) (Melissa screaming) I'd like to thank you for coming and viewing our ceremony this evening, detective. - You're gonna suffer for all the innocent lives you've taken. - That's quite impossible. It's you I'm afraid that's going to suffer. You see, you want me just as much as your brother and the others did. So I'm afraid your efforts will be quite futile. - No. I'm much stronger than all the rest. You're certainly no match for me, you bitch. - We'll see. - You are the lowest form of human life. - See, I'm not. You may want to employ the use of your sword. It's the only weapon in the right hands that can destroy me. (swords clanging) - [Melissa] No! Les! No! No! Please help me! Les! (Melissa screaming) (glass breaking) Les, help me! Let go of me! (zombie groaning) (cult members chanting in foreign language) - Stop! Let her go, you bastards! I'm onto you, your game is over! Delissa, come to me! Delissa, come to me! Delissa! - Detective, detective. She can't hear you. Not anymore. - Captain Levi? You? You're the head of all this? This murderous pack of scumbags? - Thank you, Les. Murderous evil is our business. I accept your endorsement. - Delissa! Listen to me! Come to me, Delissa! Listen to me! Come to me! - She will not listen to you. I am her master. And I am their master. - What, you and that bitch Sedgewick? - Victoria serves me. She's back there with those little brats. Oh, she loves their attention and their adoration of her sexuality. But tonight she dies when I'm purifying the sacrifice. - If you harm one hair on her body, I swear I'll kill you! - Come, come, Les. This is such a little sacrifice to honor my master, for whom I even gave up my own son, Danny. - You monster! - No, no, Les. That is a vampire. I am a demon. And this is the day that the Gates of Hell open, and we shall go home! There will be no more blood sacrifice for my Prince. He shall have a mate! - You're a monster. No! Don't you turn away from me, Levi! Look at me! I know what you did! You killed all those kids. You dug up their bodies just so they can serve you. I know, Levi. You killed my brother. What are you doing? And then, you killed my partner. - The preparation is now complete. - [Les] You even killed that priest. - She is now ready. - [Les] Levi! - Oh, come forth, my Prince, my beautiful Prince! - No! - Come forth! Oh Prince, yes! - No! You're not gonna turn Delissa too, into a force of evil! - Oh Prince, it was I who secured her for you. I know that you shall enjoy her. - [Les] No, don't destroy her from me, Levi! - For me though, but unrivaled riches! - You're a fool! - And evil! - You bastard! (demonic growling) - Delissa! No! Delissa! No! (explosion booming) (birds tweeting) Are you all right? Are you fine? - I'm fine. Everything turned out fine. - I guess that crystal really did the job, huh? - I guess. - The explosion must have put us out all night. - Hmm. - Come here. I love you. Come on. We better get home. We've got a wedding to plan. (ominous music) (upbeat jazz music)
