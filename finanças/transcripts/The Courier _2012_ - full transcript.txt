Where is the money, Courier? 6 minutes left. Back up a little bit. Back up a little bit more. Back up. Please, don't do this. - I'm the Courier. - Throw the bag. Are you okay? - No. - Hang on. - Okay, do not move, I'm almost there. - Perfect. What do you got? The money was delivered on time. The job is done. And the other job... the Russian has disappeared. What about the cash? Lost. Coffee? Fuck you. Find your own house. Look at his feet, the way they move. - You see that, Lucy? - Yeah. That is a kind of beauty right there. He's dancing. God, you're getting big. You smell like art class. Thank you, Lucy. I bet one hundred bucks, that the Irishman's gonna take him down with the next combination. Girl, you're gonna watch Grandpa losing $ 100. He's clumsy. He's letting his guide down. There he goes. I told you. I've taught you too well. That's the problem. Lucy, we must go, honey, we're gonna be late for school. - Thanks, Dad. - Bye, kiddo. - See you tomorrow. - Goodbye, baby. - How are you? - Good. Nice to see you again. - Yes, me too. Ready? Lets go. Let's take care of that cut. Lucy's right. The glue's smell's beginning to drive me crazy. One night he posed this... stakes about who's getting killed, and I said to him: How do you do that? How do you keep going on out there? And he says to me: The secret of pain, Eddie, is that you can only ever feel it in one place at a time, and all you need to know is where to feel it. All right. So, it gets to you after a while, doesn't it? What? Being alone. You know, it wouldn't hurt you to... get out in the world and see that there's more to life. I could help you there, you know. I could. I would amaze you. I have a way with the la... Hey, hey, you can not come in here! They say you're the best, that you can find anyone, you don't ask questions, you don't choose sides, you don't care what you're delivering. And because of this, I have been kindly asked... to offer you this job. $ 100,000 to deliver this case. And if I say no? You have two and a half days to deliver the case. Hey. Fuck you. If you deliver it, you get the money and you'll never see us again. But... - if you decide to decline my offer... - God. - God. - ...or... You don't make the time, and as you can see, you're not the only people we can find. Whom I deliver this to? A man called Evil Sivle. Where is he? If I knew that I wouldn't be here. This is $ 10,000. I hope this covers your expenses. You get the rest once the case is delivered. You have 60 hours, starting now. The time is ticking. No sign of the Russians or the case. Whoever has it, is dead. On the other side, Steele has taken care of our Lake Charles problem and he is on his way to St. Louis. Keep me informed. Now, you just tell her we moved here 'cause it's closer to the toy stores and I'm gonna take her there. Okay? You'll be strong. Bye. What? If there's no destination, why does something have to get there? You know what it is? They just wanna find this guy. Then I'll find him. And in doing so, I'm gonna find these other two assholes. Stitch, Im gonna take care of this. - What do you know about this Evil Sivle? - Nothing good. Used to run with Maxwell. Some kind of hitman or something. Real brutal. No one ever saw him, but everyone knew his name. And sometime, way before Katrina, they all just disappeared. - What do you mean "they disappeared"? What happened? - No one knows. But that's New Orleans, right? No one asks any questions. Who is this guy? He was Maxwell's accountant. If you gotta find somebody from that crew, you start with him. One day the Feds are gonna trace you hacking into their database, you know? They didn't caught me yet and ain't gonna do. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Anna? Uncle Eddie. I don't believe it. Look at you. The last time I saw you, you were no bigger than a second rope covered in grease raising fire in your daddy's shop. How is he doing? Well, come on in. What brings you to New Orleans? What do you need today, Courier? You know we got all that good stuff roll out off trucks on route 90. I need something light and untraceable. 'Cause you say so, Courier? You're stepping up in the world? I've never known you to carry. That's okay. We have what you need. Walther 380 ACP. - Shits your hands, can't trust her. - Name a lady that you can? - Colt 38, short nose. She ain't do no darts. - She's a solid shot. This here is the Ford of armament. I need a Cadillac. We have a Magnum .44, 3-inch. Thus the V8 powered '67 Cadillac of handguns. May I ask you guys something? What do you know about a guy named Evil Sivle? You don't want a part of that. Is that right. I've seen him about a decade ago. Death came down and laid his finger on New Orleans. And that finger belonged to Evil Sivle. So that's you're looking for? You don't need these kind of guns, Courier. - Why is that? - Because that man is dead. His body came back from the dead. You see that, gringo? Voodoo braught him back to life, 'cause death's left hand can't die. So you don't want a part of chasing that ghost. No part at all. I tell you what: I'll take the Caddy and the HK. That's the best pistol ever built, the Magnum 350. Do you need something else, Courier? In fact I do. I gotta get to St. Louis fast. - We can help you with that. - I thought you could. One hour. Let me get you the keys to the gate. But you gonna have to get your own pilot. And that. It was nice doing business, boys. - Stitch. - You arrived? - Not yet. Call Jimmy for me. - Are you on your way? Yeah, I'm a quarter mile west Bayou Teche, just north of the 83. - I'll call him for you. - Yeah, right away. Brief him. Eddie sent me. He said you needed a pilot. - Stitch. - I'm guessing she made it. - Yes, she is here. What the hell happened to Jimmy? - He's tied up. You can just ask me. I'm standing right in front of you. - How long? - She was five. - I've know him since I was four. Since she was five? - I chose her for a good reason. - How come? I used to work repo with my father. She's been stealing cars since before she could ride a bike. She has been down a very rough road for someone so young. Her mother abandoned her, dissapeared back into China... her father ended up in prison. I practically raised her, while he was inside. She's sort of like Deidre's little sister. She is tough, she's smart, she's not afraid of anything. You think I would send you someone who couldn't do the job? And besides, I thought the two of you might, you know, sort of get together. - You both need somebody. - No more surprises, Stitch. You're unbelievable. I'm glad you think so. You think you're really charming, don't you? Refreshing, isn't it? Answer me something. Why you're workinf with Stitch again? I need the money. And that's none of your business. Well, actually... it is my business. Wait a minute. I didn't agree to steal anything. We don't steal it. We borrow it briefly. Borrow? And I guess your friends just misplaced the keys? Something like that. You coming? - You know this is gonna cost you extra? - Yeah, it already has. So, what exactly do you? I deliver things. What's in it? Jesus. Do you always ask so many questions? Questions come with the pilot. Silence will cost you triple. - I never asked what's in it. - Why not? Because that's why people hire me. I don't get involved. I don't ask questions. I simply deliver. Well, that sounds to me like you're involved. You might think you're not, but... Maybe you to concentrate on your driving a little bit. If I can fly and talk, I can drive and talk. All right, wait a second. We're gonna take it right up here. You see that black car? Stay two car lengths behind it. If you watch his blinkers, you don't use yours. When he returns, you wait five seconds, then you turn. You'll mirror everything he does. - Is this a standard delivery procedure? - Procedures evolve. Go nicely. Turn the car off. Stay here. Hey! Damn it! Hey! Wait a minute. Calm down. I have a few questions. - It is not safe here. - What is not safe? He's back. He's gonna unleash his vengeance on all of us. - Let me go, please. - Where is he? Where Evil Sivle? No one finds Evil Sivle. He'll find you. And if he does, he'll the last thing you'll ever see. Why is he back? Why is he back? Retribution. Evil's taking back what was taken from him. Shit. Shit. Why am I doing this again? What? San Fran Tanna is dead. The old record data is destroyed. Steele's dead, too. What happened? We're not sure. - It's your job to be sure. - Yes, sir. I'm taking back what is mine in three days. - I can't have any lose ends. - Yes, sir. - Finish Steele's job and find the case now. - Yes, sir. Stanton, come in here. Sit down, son. I got you something. - My birthday isn't for another two days. - I couldn't wait. Hey, let me. Sit down. The bandages are right there. Did you ever think maybe it's time to find a new line of work? That didn't hurt. Just keep pressure on it, okay? I can quite place your accent. Where are you from? A little bit of everywhere, I guess. Has 'everywhere' have a name? I was born in China. But after that... just everywhere. Why did you come back? 'Cause life has a nasty sense of humor. What? Your perfume. It's Lilies of the Valley. Don't you like it? No, I think... - it's just... - Bad? Thank you. For warning me. - How's she doing? - She talks too much. Whatever. Thank you. - Do you want coffee? - I gotta go. Walk with me. - How's Deidre? - What do you think? I moved her and Lucy to the safe house, but I didn't say why, and it's harder when she doesn't know why. But what you're gonna do. You did the right thing. You wanna talk about what you're not telling me? What do you know about this guy? That's Jack Straw. He's a small-time dealer. You'll find him around St. Ann and Dauphine. Thanks. Hey! Keep an eye on her, okay? Rough day yesterday. - Don't move! - I swear I didn't say anything, but I'd do anything! - Stay off! - Man, I didn't do nothing. Don't do this! Run! Run! Get in the car! You, get the fuck out, now! Are you going to kill me? I mean, my god, are you going to kill me? If I ever thought to kill you, I would've done it already, all right? So, shut up! I'm looking for Evil Sivle, and I know god damn well he's looking for you. Where is he? I don't know. I swear to god, man. I don't know anyhing about him. I don't even know who he is! Why you're the only person alive on that hit list? Fuck. It's starting to come back to you now? Well, here's how this is gonna work: You lie to me, you bullshit me, you keep anything from me... I'll put a bullet to your leg and throw you out of this car and meet you where you fall. You understand me? - What do you wanna know, man? - The accountant mentioned retribution. - What did he mean? - I don't know. What did he mean? No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Look. All I know is that anybody who had any connection with him 10 years ago is having a dust-to-dust reunion, if you know what I mean. What happened 10 years ago? Who are you? I'm the person keeping you alive. So, answer the question. Ten years ago... hell brought to New Orleans. And Evil Sivle was the match. Evil Sivle was the walking death, do you hear me? - Even God himself shook when he heard that name. - And what about Maxwell? Did he shake? - Is that why Evil disappeared? - No. Maxwell loved him like a son. Out of the blue he killed his wife and kid. Sent their bodyparts by mail. But nobody knows what happened after that. Some say that Evil killed Maxwell, some say that Maxwell killed Evil, some say they all died that day. If they're all died, then why you're on the top of that fucking hit list? Because I ask too many fucking questions. Hey. Shit. Mayor Shirer's office. Can you explain to me, why these people are dead? And I found this in the car you jacked. Or how about, why every place you leave, there's a body behind you? I don't have anyhing to say to you, detective. There's a call for you. Just sit tight. Hey! - There he is! - Woo, woo. - How the fuck did you get out? - I just really had to use the restroom. You've got friends everywhere, don't you? You're free to go. I got a call from the sergeant, who got a call from the lieutenant, who got a call from the mayor, which got a call from some friend of yours. Who's this friend of mine? Good day, gentlemen. Got a package for you. - You gotta be kidding me. - What? No. Who sent it? I don't know. I just got a call and grab it up. They told me what you look like. Stitch, where are you? Call me right away. Hello? - Hello. - How are you, Eddie? - Who is this? - How's your family? - Your granddaughter is growing up so fast. - Do I know you? Listen. Where's this friend of yours looking for Evil Sivle? Listen to me. I don't know who you are, and I don't know what you want. And I don't know anything about what's going down, okay? Hello? Welcome home. You set me up. You pay me with money that is evidence linked to the NOPD? You get me out of jail with a murder charge? You bugged my apartment? Did you think I'd find you? That I'd figure out that you're a Fed? What are you talking about a murder charge? You built the rules and got my goddaughter into this. You go to hell. It wasn't me that got you out. Think about it. Even if I legally could pull that off, it would take me weeks of papaerwork. And favors I don't do. And this here... This is two generations higher than anything we got the budget for. Evil Sivle is dead. Really? Why would I get a briefcase of a Russian courier... with three days to deliver to? And why do bodies keep piling up with his name on 'em? Four years I've been looking for Evil Sivle. And then in one day you got closer to him than I've ever have. But now we have him. Because we have something he wants. And what's that? You. I deliver packages. I don't chase ghosts. It looks to me that this ghost is now chasing you. He wants you on the street for a reason. And we all know, if you wanna walk out of this, you've to find him before he finds you. This case maybe the only thing keeping you alive right now. Maybe. Walking out the door doesn't mean it's over. Yes, it does. Hello? I don't like people who hang up on me. I already told you, I don't know nothing. Who's your friend with the case, Eddie? Look, Eddie... Shit. Stitch. Stitch! Stitch. No. It's okay, okay? I'll see you soon. THIS WILL KEEP YOU ALIVE. It's Anna. I can't find Eddie. We're running out of time. Where are we? The old man didn't know much, and he didn't last long. So I'm sure the Courier will be probably motivated. Also, there's a girl with him. - Who's she? - She's connected to the old man somehow. Get rid of the girl. That should motivate him a little bit more. Listen to me. If we miss the deadline, I want you take the boy. - Where? - Far away. - For how long? - Until I'll show up, you understand? - I understand. - Dad? When we're going home? Soon enough. Where did you get this? That is... It's from an old roller coaster. Let me guess. Running into a burning building to save a helpless girl. That was a long time ago. Gas pipe exploded below my apartment. I actually don't remember. You're lucky that you're alive. Am I? Stitch found me. Got me on my feet. I guess, if there was luck, it was him. What's going on? - We got 30 seconds. - Who are they? - Hurry up. - Let's go. - They wanna kill you. - Hurry up. - Yes. We go through that door. Up the stairs. Go. Why is this happening? It's not about him, is it? We're just in the way. Why did you take that? Why didn't you give it to him? Stop! Talk to me. They've seen your face, and they know who you are. You understand that? I can't protect you anymore. You should stay. What do you think you're doing? I've sworn I'd never do this again. Coming? We lost him. Who is this guy? All we know is that the old man found him after he got beaten and left to die. Anything more he wouldn't know. But don't worry, his need for revenge is too strong for him to be careful. He will expose himself soon. - Where's the Russian? - Still missing. Okay, I need to know what my weakness is, before it's too late. Dad? Not now, Stanton. God damn it. I'm busy. Look, man, the situation is very serious. They gave me 3 days to deliver this fucking case to Evil Sivle. They said they would kill me, if I wouldn't deliver on time. But Evil Sivle is the last face you'll ever see. I'm dead anyway, if you don't do something. I want you to go back there, and we will protect you. You wanna use me as bait? Complete insanity. This is not a game. He will kill me. I am a courier... Hey! What are you doing here, Anna? Do I know you? No, but I know you. I thought you gotta out of all this shit. It's a tough thing about choices. You can make a thousend right ones, but it only takes one wrong one, and you're fucked. Did you lose the keys? If you want to find Evil Sivle you've got to understand where he came from. Maxwell met with Evil when he was 13 years old. He loved him like a son, taught him everything he knew. How do you know all this? Because I was their eyes and ears on the streets. I kept them well informed. - So, why did paradise crumble? - A woman. Evil fell in love. But she didn't want him part of the business anymore. Especially after she got pregnant. When Evil saw his boy everything changed. He tried to get out of it, but Maxwell thought of it as the ultimate betrayal. So, Maxwell dropped the contract having Evil's son and wife killed? But he made a mistake. He didn't kill Evil. Evil went insane. I mean, he wiped everybody out from the top to the bottom. But you've already been thinking about choices, haven't you? Probably been sreaming in the back of your mind since you first met them. Am I right? But I can help you with that choice. I can offer you a chance to get out of this life once and for all. You're in grave danger. Both of you. All you gotta do is keep in touch, tell me what he finds and tell me where he is. If you help me... I promise tomorrow you've your life back. Free. Fuck you. - Tell me what's going down in 3 days? - He's coming to finish what he started. He'll wipe out everybody who sold him out, including me! He hired the Capos. He hired those fuckers and people to deliver. Easy, easy. Easy. I unequivocally am sorry. You're all right? Yes. Okay, lets go. We gotta find the Capos. Did you pick up the signal? Why are you doing this? It's not gonna bring him back, you know? - No, but it'll make it right. - How? To lose everything? Pick up the phone. Agent Lispy. Fuck! It's not the real case. It's been wired. Jesus! Did we get it? Press Playback. - We got the case. - Who's he working for? We don't know yet. Vegas. What's in Vegas? Let's go. If he wants to play, we play. We should polish the silver polish. Sounds like we'll have guests tonight. It's time to go home and have some fun. With a garlic press? I love it. - He took the bait, with hook and all. - Good. Stanton, play something else. You know I hate that piece. I need a taxi to the Lucky 7. Yeah, right away. In Laurel, Mississippi? If I'm not back by morning, you take the car and you get to that address. That's where I sent Stitch's family. What? I don't know what's gonna happen. But I'll find you when it's over. - No. - It's the safest place for you, Anna. Why are you doing this? Just stop. He's gone. Please. You have the address. You can't be here. You're very persistent. Just give me your location and I'll get you both out of this mess. Yes? - How? - I'll come. - What is yor location? - In Las Vegas. - Lucky 7. - Where's he heading? - Names, addresses, anything? - He has a phonebook. I could check. Don't let us down, Anna. These are very dangerous people. He's with the FBI. He said that he could help. Don't you see? It's a win-win here. A chance. To start something new. Something away from all this. Isn't that what we want for us? Wait! Wait! There he is. Welcome back. So you want to find Evil Sivle. We'll take you to him. But you've to promise to do something for us. When you see him in hell, tell him I send my regards. That was for the briefcase back in New Orleans. Now, did you know that until the second century, torture was pemanently used on slaves? See, they believed that a slave would only tell the truth, if it was extracted from him. But over the time tortures were applied to everybody. It gave a means for the good to purge the earth of evil. My wife is a bit of a romantic, but I'm more practical. Wouldn't you say? Yeah. The way I see it, the gateway to understanding is through pain... and we are that gate! Go ahead. - Five seconds. - Yes. Ten seconds. That's your death reflex kicking in. The burn is an adrenaline release, and your heart rate's rising. You see, your mind believes you're drowning, death is taking possession of you. But that's just your mind fucking with you. The pain is needed to bring the truth, doesn't cloud your mind with lies. So, the problem we found in torture... is that the tortured often just confess to what they thought the good guys wanted to hear. So, as everything else, torture had to change, evolve. And you know what we discovered? The good must do it this way so the evil does not want it to stop. Make it so you want the pain as much as I need to give it to you. And you know how we do that? We find the truth... together. Did you know that in the tips of fingers there're millions and millions of fibers called... nociceptors? A like a speed dial of pain to the brain. Now, you can ask me any question you want, and I'll answer anything you wanna know... but each question is gonna cost you a considerable amount of pain. The more pain you feel, the more honest your questions will be. And soon we'll find the truth. Ready? - You might as well die knowing... - Question? ...because dying without knowing, that's real torture. Question. Please. - Where is Evil Sivle? - Evil Sivle is dead. Right now your speed dial's desperately calling your brain trying to find a reason. But, as we've already seen, the brain lies. Next question. That's not a question. Okay. If Evil's dead, who is behind this? That's a much better question. Technically, Evil is more of an idea now. Something to inspire fear to everyone that hears that name. This is why Maxwell is using his name. We go by. Stay with us now, okay? Your body just learned that the only antidote for pain is honesty. Next question. Listen, if you don't start asking the questions, we're gonna have to start asking the questions. - And trust me, that's gonna be much more pain. - Like, who hired you? Hey, are you telling me... that Maxwell is Evil? Of course, who else would be able to do all this? Shit, I think he's blacking out. You did good, even much better than your friend Stitch. We try again later, okay? When you're feeling better. You take a little rest. I'm going to get something out of the freezer and start cooking. The only place where you can find it, is in your past. - Who... - ...is Evil Sivle? No one ever saw him. Why is he back? We'll find the truth together. Your perfume. It's Lilies of the Valley. - Don't you like it? - I can't remember. When Evil had fallen in love, had a son, everything changed. - Who's Evil Sivle? - He used to run with Maxwell. - Evil Sivle is dead. - Voodoo has brought him back to life. - How he came back from the dead? - Can you tell me your name? - I don't remember. - He's coming back and finish what he started. - Your name. - Who are you? All right. It needs thyme. I don't get it. What can I put in here? - Whatever you want, dear. - I have no more lemon. Only just salt is good I suppose. - Im sure it will be great. I don't know. I guess I could just put some... Where's Maxwell? Where is he? In the casino Paradise, you motherfucker. - Maxwell? - What? The Capos are dead. - Fuck! Where's the boy? - Out of the city. ♪ Dreaming, I'm always dreaming ♪ ♪ Dreaming love will be mine ♪ ♪ Searching, I'm always searching ♪ ♪ Hoping someday I'll find ♪ ♪ Someone, someone to love me ♪ ♪ Someone who needs me but until then ♪ Who is it? "Who is it?" It's not what you expected. So you're alive. I think we're just all pretending to be something else, don't we, kid? Look at my face. Is this the face of the man I used to be? This is the face of a broken heart. You have no idea, do you? I've always wondered what happened to your body, kid. That's why I hired the Russian courier. I had to know. Now, I guess, if we're all looking to death, yours gonna find a way or another, don't you? I gave you my life, kid. I gave you my heart and you betrayed it. When a man makes those kind of choices, you gotta deal with the consequences, don't you? Do you think without Julia we're still would be in business today? You can change everything, kid, but you can't change your eyes. Especially yours. You really don't remember, do you? You were nothing more than a street punk when I pulled you out of the gutter. I taught you everything you know. We were building an empire, you and me. Did you really think I let Julia turn that down? Evil fell in love with Julia. But she didn't want him in the business anymore. As Evil saw his son, everything changed. He tried to leave Maxwell, but Maxwell saw it as the ultimate betrayal. So he killed Julia and his son. Evil went insane. He wiped everybody out from top to bottom. After this nobody heard of him again. Some say Maxwell killed Evil, others say Evil killed Maxwell and then disappeared. It changed everything. But ultimately you happen to know, none of us has really changed, do you? No matter what we do, we can never clean away the stain on our soul. Even if you deny it, you know your family is dead because of you. Ain't that right, Evil? No! Do you remember this? Used to call it the Cadillac of guns. Listen, kid, I'm going home. It ain't gonna be the same unless you're there. - Huh? What do you say? For old times' sake? - Go to hell. If you wanna do it, do it quick. I offered you the world twice now. But you're always breaking my heart. My mistake was... I should've burried you that day with Julia. Hey, that's my boy, he's back. If you pull that trigger, you'll never find out where your son is. - My son? - Come on, man. You didn't think I'd kill him, did you? I love that boy. Where is my son? He's just like you, man. He got that anger. He got that coolness. That absolute perfect attachment. He got that probably when he watched his mama die. You'll never find out where your son is.
