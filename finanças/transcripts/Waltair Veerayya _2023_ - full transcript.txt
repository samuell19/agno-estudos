Even before I learned to walk, my mother would tell others that one day my name would appear on film posters. My father led me towards the goal to make my mother's dream come true. I pay my respects to them with love. Bobby Kolli. MAREDUMILLI ANDHRA PRADESH One target remaining. One target remaining. Mom! RAW HEADQUARTERS NEW DELHI What? A crash landing? Are you guys okay? We are all fine, sir. Is Solomon safe? Solomon is fine, sir. Okay, don't worry. We will trace your location. Do one thing. Detain him at a nearby police station for the night. I will send a backup team in the morning. Be careful, guys. He is a monster. Is there any police station nearby? -Happy retired life, Mr. Murthy. -Thank you, sir. -Mr. Murthyâ€¦ -Thank you. We all try to avoid working night shifts, but you insist on working night shifts. Why do you love this work so much? I'll tell you the truth as it's my last day. Go ahead. My wife's snoring scares me more than this job, sir. Excuse me. It's the SP. -Sir? -A plane has crash-landed in your village. A plane has crash-landed? Some RAW officials are bringing an international criminal. Keep him in your custody tonight. I think they are here, sir. MAREDUMILLI POLICE STATION Sir, the SP has called me. I am Circle Inspector Seethapathi. Please come. Why are you calling me repeatedly, dear? I am busy at work. Dad, Mom slipped while coming down the stairs and suffered a head injury. -We're taking her to the hospital. -What? I'm coming there. Don't worry. What happened, sir? My wife fell down the stairs. I need to go to the hospital. Mr. Murthy, can you manage the station for three hours? I've done this for 30 years. I can do it for three more hours. -Please go ahead, sir. -Thank you very much, Mr. Murthy. Eat this food. Have you taken an oath that you are willing to die on duty? Not just me. Everyone who joins the police force takes that oath. Eat. Does this station have a generator? Why do you need a generator when the power is on? Looks like the fuse is gone. Check it. Okay, sir. Alert! Come on, guys. Place the rack against the door. Hey! Stop there! As long as I am alive, I won't let anyone escape from this station. Move! I've done this for 30 years. I can do it for three more hours. You can go ahead. POLICE HEADQUARTERS Solomon Caesar is residing in Malaysia now. He is the one running the drug mafia there. If you assign a special team to me, I will go to Malaysia, arrest him and bring him back to India. We should hang him in front of the deceased officers' family members. You've already failed me once and created a big mess. You need a special team now? You have been suspended. Look. You are just an honest cop who never takes a bribe. Don't act like a hero. Get lost. -Brother-in-lawâ€¦ -Dear! Oh! Balraju! When did you come here? How are you doing? You've been drinking a lot. What's wrong with you, Brother-in-law? If you keep on drinking like this, thinking about your deceased colleagues, what will happen to us then? How long will this go on? Until justice is delivered. I know who killed my colleagues. I know where he lives. Yet I can't nab him. If there's anyone who can catch him and bring him here, I will stop all this. Brother-in-lawâ€¦ Rest assured that I'll catch the guy you wanted. That's why I have come to you. I can't see my brother-in-law and sister suffer. I'm ready to pay what you ask for. But please-- Consider the work done. Sirâ€¦ The schoolteacher is refusing to sign the documents. Hey, Teacher! Why do you want to mess with Pedda Reddy? If you hand over your land to him, he will build a shopping mall. Else you will be chopped into pieces. -Hello! -My boss wants to talk to you. -Who is that? -Boss Waltair-- The reception is bad here. -Waltair? -Waltairâ€¦ Speak up! Waltair? Waltair Veerayya! Sirâ€¦ Sir, the signal is weak here. Sir, please hold on a minute. Please hold on, sir. There is no signal. Sirâ€¦ Why is there no signal? I'm getting a signal here. Please tell me, sir. Let go! -Shall I let go of my life? -No. Let go of the schoolteacher whom you are holding captive. I will let him go, sir. I swear, sir. I didn't know that he is your acquaintance. Here are your documents, sir. I made a mistake. I didn't know you're from Jalaripeta. If Reddy troubles you again, I will thrash him. Drop the teacher at his house. Sir, you are a swag guy yourself. Why are you so scared of him? He is the very epitome of swag. Das will finish the job, Brother-in-law. I now know who the real boss is. The one whom goons like Das fear the most. He saved an acquaintance of his with just a phone call. Why don't we approach him? Where do we find him? You heard him. His name is Waltair Veerayya, and he resides in Jalaripeta. JALARIPETA, VIZAG Why have they come at this hour? What's the matter, sir? Where is Mr. Veerayya? -What happened, sir? -We've got a problem. A dangerous gang from Bangladesh has landed here to smuggle drugs. And they have a track record of killing many coast guards who tried to stop them. They have captured four coast guards now. We need to rescue our guards before they leave the Indian territorial waters. It's difficult to use helicopters for rescue operations in this storm. That's why we have come to seek Veerayya's help. What is it, you bastards? Hey fool! A force is on the way to beat the hell out of you. What kind of force? Army force? Navy force? Air force? What force are you talking about? Mega force! Who is he? The King of seas. The man who rules over the Bay of Bengal. A burning fire! He is the real man! The scourge of evil, He is the blazing sun! He's coming on such a small boat! He can't even climb up here. Okay, boss. He is the sibling of Poseidon! He is the destroyer of all malefic forces! He is like Sage Vasishta, Who meditates peacefully amidst storms! He severs the heads of evil forces! Veerayya! Veerayya! Veerayya! Veerayya! The pitch is amazing. Shall we play? If I get in a boat and set out to sea, the waves will rise up! Oh, is that so? If there's a storm, the waves will indeed rise up. Once I start my work, your head will fly along with the rising waves. Let's see. Come on. I am coming. Why did Mr. Veerayya refuse to join us for a party and ask us to come here? Maybe he is throwing a special party. Let's see.

Your Honor, my client Veerayya has been doing everything he can to bring in the witness. If you kindly grant us two weeks' time-- If you allow us four weeks' time, we will bring the witness to the next hearing. It's not the first time you are making such a request. How many more adjournments do you want? Your Honor, please pardon me for turning up late to the court. Why are you surrounded by so many bouncers like a film hero gracing a public event? What can I say, Your Honor? I have been receiving death threats for doing my job. Who's threatening you? Who else? It's Veerayya's gang. They are abusing me in unparliamentary language, Your Honor. -When did I abuse you? -You let your henchmen do it. Mr. Veerayya, are you threatening the public prosecutor? Mr. Murthy! Honorable Judge! I didn't threaten him. I just gave him a mild warning. We are fishermen, sir. We venture out to the sea to catch fish. We don't know anything else. -Am I right, guys? -Yes! Please don't believe him, Your Honor. They are rogues in the guise of fishermen. The case was first heard four years ago. Not an inch of progress has been made ever since. Instead of adjourning the case and wasting this court's time, I humbly request the court to strike out this case. Thank you. All right. This is good behavior. Hey, you son of a gun! -I'm going to strangle youâ€¦ -Veerayya, calm down. Order! Order! Defense Attorney, the next hearing will be in the afternoon session. It will be postponed only if the prosecutor agrees to it. Otherwise, I will dismiss the case. This court is adjourned for lunch. He has agreed to postpone the hearing, but he wants something in return. How much does he want? Twenty five. -Dollar, send it from your phone. -Okay. Rs. 25,000. The prosecutor wants Rs. 25 lakh, not Rs. 25,000. -Rs. 25 lakh? -Yes. -You bastardâ€¦ -Someone please stop him. You bloody buggerâ€¦ Bastardâ€¦ I'll thrash you. Veerayya! Do you want to win this case or not? Where can I get Rs. 25 lakh all of a sudden? Boss, some cash-rich people came looking for you. They are waiting for you at the tea stall. Cash-rich fellows! So, I should go to Malaysia and bring this Salman Khan here. It's not Salman Khan or Shah Rukh Khan. His name is Solomon Caesar. It doesn't matter. What the hell! We'll get him. How much will it cost? I'll let you know after discussing it with my financial adviser. Will you talk it out, please? We will talk it out if you give us some privacy. Come with me. -All right, boss. -Come on. We have to go abroad. We'll be forgoing our regular income. Including all our expenses, let's charge them Rs. 15 lakh. Rs. 15 lakh? Please come here. It will cost Rs. 25 lakh. -You were discussing Rs. 15 lakh. -Were you eavesdropping? Why would I listen to what he says? He is your financial adviser. I just wanted to know how much I can charge you. I'm not sure these guys are the right people for the job. Rs. 25 lakh is exorbitant. Let's look for another gang that can get the job done. Brother-in-law-- Here's an advance of Rs. 5 lakh. Awesome! -Hey, Accountant. -Yes? Give this Rs. 5 lakh to the prosecutor and tell him we'll pay the rest within 10 days. All right. What are you staring at? Go and arrange for our travel. Okay. The final announcement is over. But the fishermen haven't arrived yet. They are not going on a picnic. They are professionals. -They have their own plans. -Okay. Oh, my! Look over there. The gang is here. Where is the gang leader? This is Veerayya's gang. Excuse me! Yeah! Coming, boss. Terrific. Superb. That's enough. Let me see them. -See how amazing these pics are! -It's awesome. -People will be jealous of you. -Let's go. A foreign girl! Taking photos again? Why do you stop every time you see a chick? I can't do it. Leave me alone. He is running away! -Where are you going? -I amâ€¦ scared. Leave me alone. I can't get on a plane. Let go of me. Let me go, guys. My heart is beating so fast. Veerayya, what happened? You are acting like a kid. What is this nonsense? Wait. Veerayya, what is the problem? I've been scared of heights since childhood. Just the thought of flying gives me palpitations. Veerayya, do you suffer from vertigo? What is vertigo? Is it a viral fever? It is like a phobia. People with vertigo are scared of looking down from great heights. And you've asked such a guy to kidnap a mobster. -Take the money back. -Stop it. Is there no medicine for this? There is. I took it, but it's not working. Why don't you increase the dose? Mr. Balraju wants me to increase the dose. -Where is it? -Here you go. -Is this what you call medicine? -This is my courage-boosting tonic. -Now I've got my confidence back. -Yes. Let's go. The medicine is working. Boss, ask them about it. You know, I like to get things clarified before I begin my work. Finally! My brother-in-law has been waiting for this moment. Mr. Seethapathi. Do we get stuff like sandwiches here like what we get in Bangkok? Not just sandwiches, you get pizzas, burgers and everything. Brother-in-law, he's not asking for edible sandwiches. -He's asking for sandwich massages. -You are right. Why are you so shocked? The boys love it. We trust you to take care of us. What the hell? We should take care of them? They need to focus on the job. Wow! Oh, my God! We should appreciate Mr. Seethapathi for booking us such a nice motel. You are right. It's amazing. They don't know the difference between a hotel and a motel. You've put them up in a 7-star hotel. Is it necessary? It is necessary. This hotel is owned by Solomon Caesar. It'll be easy to plan our move against him if we stay here. I see. It's your room access card, sir. -Mine? -Yes, sir. You speak Telugu! Are you a Telugu? -Yes, sir. I'm from Guntur. -Oh, Guntur! People from Guntur can live anywhere. They can rule over any place. Thank you, sir. My room is on the ground floor, right? No, sir. It's on the 15th floor. It has a fabulous view. You get a beautiful view of the city. My room is up there? -Let's shake hands. -My pleasure. You bastard! -I'll rip you apart. -Veerayyaâ€¦ I've already told them about your problem. Yet they allotted a room for me on the 15th floor? -Sirâ€¦ -I will break your hand. Only the rooms on the 15th floor are available now. Please understand. What the hell! I won't stay in this motel. -Let's go. -Veerayyaâ€¦ It's important that we stay in this hotel. -Then you stay here. -Please listen-- Excuse me. This slap on my cheek Is so bewitching This smooth cheek of yours Is so delicate like a blossoming flower This slap on my cheekâ€¦ -Hello. -Hello. I am Athidhi, the guest relations manager. I understand your problem. Let me hold your hands, please. -Come on. -Do as she says. Come on. Are you a Telugu? Yes, I'm from Hyderabad. Wow! People from Hyderabad can make a living anywhere. They can rule over any place. Shall we go? Come on. -Please come. -Move it. Come. Don't worry. -Please let go of me. -Move. Why are you pushing me? Why are you looking there? Look at me. Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes. I feel shy. Please. He is feasting his eyes on her. If the sky turns into a woman, She will look like youâ€¦ Hey, don't stop it. It's in sync with me. Let it continue. Look into my eyes. If happiness turns into merriment, It will sum up my moodâ€¦ We have arrived at our floor. The song has ended too. It would be nice if we could go up a few more floors. I'll show you to your rooms. Come. I'm glad he didn't ask for one more ride. -It's a good idea. -Let's go. Open the door. Bloody hell! Wow! This is your common area. This is your bedroom. -And this is your living room-- -Missâ€¦ This is your living room, and you have the best view. Do I get to see you from there every day? Sorry? How can it be the best view if I don't get to see you there? Well said! -Enjoy your stay. -Sure. -Come, I will show your rooms. -Ms. Athidhiâ€¦ -Hello, ma'am. -Yes? You have brought me up so far. Who will escort me down? Make a phone call and I will come. G-Give me your number. You can call the reception. I can't bear this anymore. Ma'am, let's go. Thank you. Come. -Jealous fellow! -Indeed. We will take care of him. Hey, where is your boss? Your game is over, you fool! -Where is your boss? -He's in his room. -My game is over. -No way. -Mister-- -Hello. Ms. Athidhi, it's your special guest here. Oh, my! Yes, sir. How can I help you? I am very hungry. Can you come up and take me downstairs? Yes, I am on my way. She is here. We are paying for his entertainment here. What the heck! We have spent a fortune to bring him here, but he is busy romancing that woman. What's the matter? They are having the time of their lives at our expense. I can't bear this. -What do you want to do now? -I'll also have fun. We have a special package here. If you want, we'll definitely change it. -Take a photo now. -That's it. -Capture the twin towers too. -Superb, boss. This is amazing. -Filthy people. -Let's take a selfie. Ready? -That's it. -The top angle is superb. -Post it on Instagram. -What should I write? I enjoy Malaysia. What is this? Don't panic. I think he has called someone here. Let him come. I guess that's the guy. He is here. He looks like a chimpanzee. Take the helmet, baby. He's a baldie, Brother-in-law. Hi! -Boss! -Hey, Mani! Greetings, boss! -How are you? -I'm fine, boss. -Is everything okay? -Yes, boss. Hey, sirâ€¦ -This is Mani. He was my jail-mate. -Hi. He says it as if he was his classmate. Boss, you are in Malaysia for the first time. Let's go and enjoy ourselves. -Let's enjoy! -That's what they have done so far. Now they want to talk about work. Don't ruin it. -They are my customers. -Oh! -What is the work, boss? -Nothing much. We need to nab someone here and take him back to India. You didn't have to come this far. You should have called me, and I would've sent him to India. -I'm hurt, boss. -He's full of affection for me. I'm making faces now. Oh, no! You lose your charm. Keep your face normally. By the way, boss, what's the name of that guy? Solomon. -Solomon? -Yes. What's his full name? Solomon Caesar. What? Solomon Caesar? Baby, immediately book their flight tickets to India. -Let's send them back. -Okay, darling. -What happened? -Boss, I'll tell you. Come, boss. Do you know who you're planning to kidnap? Do you know who his brother is? Michael Caesar. A Malaysian drug lord. Don't panic. Tell me what the matter is. Let me tell you about an incident so that you will understand how he'd react if anyone attacks his brother. Three years ago, Velappan Karuppan was the unrivaled boss of Malaysian drug cartels. His brother-in-law, Velayudhan, used to handle the entire business. To destroy his drug kingdom, the newly appointed narcotics officer, Khazir, created obstacles for Karuppan. Taking advantage of that situation, Solomon and Michael started operating in areas controlled by Karuppan. When Karuppan came to know about it, he kidnapped Solomon and told his brother, Michael Caesar, to pay Rs. 5 crore as penalty. Looks like he loves his brother so much. He has brought the money. Did you think you can go back alive with your brother if you paid the money? The reason we told you to bring the money is not to recoup our losses, but to kill both of you together. Brother-in-law! Karuppan! It's the head of the narcotics officer who was giving you headache. Khazir. You imposed a penalty of Rs. 5 crore on us for doing business in your area. But you lost Rs. 100 crore because of this guy. I think this head is more valuable to you. Since we are meeting for the first time, it's a small gift from me. Now you know about my power. Let me offer you a deal. You are just a local cartel boss in Malaysia. I will supply the drug. We can rule over the world. We can supply cocaine on a global scale. Is the deal okay? The deal is okay. But on one condition. I want a return gift. What do you want? I want the life of this fellow who drew blood from my brother. You want to take my life? -Karuppan? -Brother-in-law, he wants to kill me! -You want to kill me? -Karuppanâ€¦ -Just say yes, Brother-in-law. -Karuppan! -Take it. -Will you kill me-- Ever since that day, Michael has been supplying the drugs. And Karuppan has been selling it in the international market. They've grown their businesses together. But Michael's goal is to replace Karuppan and enter the international market himself. Now Michael is in Russia to strike a big deal. Boss, please leave Malaysia before he comes back. I've never returned to the shore without catching fish. Now that I've made a promise to them, no matter who this guy is, I'll catch him and hand him over to them. Get ready, guys. Like always, Solomon will visit the casino this Friday. Some crabs will get down from the back seat. -Crabs? -It must be their code language. Carry on, Veerayya. The Barramundi fish will get down first from this car. And then the shark will get down. It sounds like a plan for selling fish, not for kidnapping a guy. This has killed my mood and excitement. People don't have any basic sense. If I say anything, they get hurt and annoyed. If I get interrupted at every stage, I'll lose my interest and it's fu-- Bossâ€¦ Please calm down! -Calm down. -I lost it. I'm sorry. Sorry, Veerayya. -What was I saying? -The shark got down from the car. Now, the Barramundi fish will follow the shark into the casino. If the Barramundi gets inside, it'll be difficult to kidnap the shark. So, we need to stop the Barramundi. Only you two can stop the Barramundi. Okay. Hey, stop! How on earth did you become a cop? If you stop him so casually, he'll shoot you dead. -You need a proper plan. -Okay, once more. Is this a luxury hotel or a flophouse? -I'm not getting hot water in my room. -We'll check. Abdullah, see to it. Call the hotel owner. -Please-- -Hey, what's going on here? Who are you? A plumber? Is this a luxury hotel or a flophouse? I'm not getting cold water in my room. Call the owner right now. We divert the attention of the Barramundi. The gold fish and smelt fish will enter the casino and take their seats. In a short while, the shark will enter the casino. He will come to his regular table and order a special drink. You will order the same. Why did you gulp it in one go? I couldn't control myself as it was Scotch. Yuck! Change your roles. Enough with your self-pity. Get to work. I won the game! I won it! I'll throw a party for all of you. -All are welcome. -Great! That's enough. After consuming the spiked drink, the shark will feel uneasy. His stomach will start acting up. He'll walk towards the washroom. In the washroomâ€¦ Hey, can't you wait? You're stomping all over it. Have you gone blind? I am cleaning here. Why don't you use another washroom? Why are you staring-- Why are you yelling at him? This is not some public toilet. It's his hotel. Show him some respect. I'm sorry, let's try it again. Your beauty is-- Sirâ€¦ Please don't step here. The floor is dirty. Lounge bathrooms are very clean, sir. -Please go there, sir. -Heyâ€¦ Why are you not playing a role in this plan? You'll just supervise it? Look over there. This is my master plan. Do remember one thing, guys. Tomorrow, if anyone doesn't adhere to the plan we devised, I will cut him up and make a soup out of him. -I'm not getting hot water in my room. -We'll check. Lounge bathrooms are very clean, sir. Sir, my ball! Thank you, sir. Vaishu! Dear! You areâ€¦ Vaishnavi! Vaishnavi! Come. Brother-in-lawâ€¦ Veerayyaâ€¦ Mom, why are you so upset ever since you saw that guy in the hotel? It's nothing, dear. Go to bed. -It's enough, boss. -Hey! Please leave me alone. -Mom, tell me. -I told you to go to bed. Oh, dear! Why are you taking out your anger on the little girl? I am sorry, Dad. I'm not feeling well. Please tuck Vaishnavi into bed. Come, dear. Let's go to bed. He has ruined our plan. Now he is enjoying a drink. What's happening, Veerayya? Who is that woman? -Why did you get upset? -Maybe she is his old flame. It must have caused an explosion of feelings in him. She is like my sister, you scumbag! If you talk nonsense about her, I will cut your throat. Calm down, please. She is like a sister to me. Yes! Come with me. This is Solomon's house, Brother-in-law. I am getting scared looking at the security here. You brought me here in a fit of rage because Veerayya yelled at you. Do you think we can actually recce this place? We cannot carry out this operation without Veerayya. As if Veerayya is a master at executing these operations. Veerayya may be a don in Vizag. But I found a local don here. His name is Thilakaratna. What is he looking at? Exactly, he's got a powerful pair of eyes. He can look in two directions at once. If we feed him information about Solomon, he will deal with him. Hush! He is coming. -Malinga, follow the car. -Okay, sir. Be careful, okay? Shall we call Veerayya as a precaution? Do you want to ruin the plan? Malinga, stop the car. You are goingâ€¦ Malinga! Malinga! Does he want Solomon's autograph? Looks like he works for Solomon. We are done for. You've been talking about a guy called Thilakaratna. Call him. He is not answering his phone. Brother-in-law, please forgive me. Please call Veerayya. I told you so! Hey, get down. Put the phone down and get out of the car. He is not picking up the call. Who sent you here? We don't understand what you are saying, sir. -Telugu? -Yes, sir. Actually, we like your car. We followed you to know its price, sir. What is its on-road price, Mr. Solomon? With insurance, you know. You have followed me because you liked my car? Exactly. And you don't know who I am? We don't know you, sir. What is this powder, Mr. Solomon? Is it glucose? Maybe it is salt. What do you say, Brother-in-law? You have already called him Mr. Solomon. Don't overact now. Shut up. Hey! I am going to give you two options. One, I'll find out who you are, and then I will kill you. Twoâ€¦ I'll kill you and then find out who you are. Sir, both the options will get us killed. My options are usually like that. Sir, please don't harm us. We are innocent people. Sir, I will tell you everything that has happened so far. Tell him, Brother-in-law. Otherwise, he will kill us. -Tell him. -Come on, speak! Sir, I am from Hyderabad. He is my brother-in-lawâ€¦ Just kill him. Shoot them dead! Why is he hanging around here? Did he join hands with this guy? I told you that I'll talk to Solomon and strike a deal with him. Why did you jump the gun? You think I will skim off some of the profits? I will thrash you. -Who is he? -His name is Veeru. He has come from India. He is in the same business as us. He wants to supply us the drug. He has brought a sample. I have checked it. The quality is good. -What did I tell you guys? -What did you tell us? I told you to take care of cooking and packing the cocaine. I said I'd market the product. -Veeruâ€¦ -Tell me, sir. I've never heard his name in the market. -What are you saying? -Abdullah. Hey, wait a minute. Take a photo now. Ali, I will send you a photo now. Check his background on your criminal database. We must trust each other in this business. We shouldn't be here if they don't trust us. Let's go. That's better. All right. We will stay back. Wait for a couple of minutes. After we get the confirmationâ€¦ I will decide where to send you. He's a good man. He'll send us back. He's bought that sample from the market. Our lives are at risk now. -Boss. -What's the matter? He is a dangerous smuggler. He served prison time for dealing cocaine worth Rs. 25 crore. He is the most notorious criminal in our database. So, your name is in the records. Good! Solomonâ€¦ It's not that my name is in the recordsâ€¦ There are many records in my name. Call me if you think you can trust me. I am staying at your hotel. My room number is 154. See you. Let's go, guys. Do not try to check his background again. He is a self-made man. And he's helped many others make a name for themselves. Okay? If you act so foolishly again, I'll bash your heads against a wall. -This guy didn't listen to me, Veerayya. -I am grateful that he saved us. But he lied to him and messed it up. What is the use? Solomon told him to leave. -I'll kick you! -Veerayya. I have laid out a trap for him as he is trying to strike a big deal. It takes time to catch a big fish, doesn't it? This idiot panics all the time. Excuse me. Yes? It's my gold fish. Excuse me. Our MD, Solomon Caesar, has invited you to his private party. Oh! Thanks. Enjoy. -Okay, babe. -Catch you later, bye. Hey, Solomon! Veeru! Thank you. This party is amazing. Veeru, can you send a huge amount of stash in a single go? Do you doubt it? Yes. But on one condition. My men will come to India and inspect the quality of your product. Deal? Okay. Why is he making a business deal with him? Come along with me to India then. Brother-in-lawâ€¦ I should go to India? -No way. -Why? Are you scared of India? I am not scared of India. India is scared of me. A few months ago, I was detained in a small police station in India one night. And I massacred everyone who was at that station that night. Brother-in-law, please calm down. Leave it. Enjoy my party. Enjoy! What's with you, Mr. Seethapathi? You are at his party. Stop glaring at him like that. -Control your emotions. -He is right. We are surrounded by his men. They can shoot us dead. I don't care about anything. If I get a gun, I will shoot him at point blank range. Control yourself. Oh, dear! What is this, guys? Why are you taking him as if you're picking up a crab from the sludge? He is my heart. Dear partner! Don't fear when I'm here to interfere. Veeru! None of these guys should leave from here alive. Shut up! Come on, guys. Mr. Solomon is over there. Don't spare anyone. Kill them all. Veeru, remove my mask. Hey, stop it! How dare you abduct Solomon? Come! Let's fight. Well done! Shit! Let me go. They are coming here. Let go of my hand. Just leave. Solomon's men are here. Come on, guys. Remove my mask. Take the mask off my face! Take off my mask. Come onâ€¦ You ruined our entire plan. Who the hell are you? I should ask you that question, ma'am. If I'd told them that it was you who attacked them, all of you would have been killed by now. Why did you guys attack Solomon? We are RAW. So are we. -What say, guys? -Yes. This cop is saluting her. They must be powerful people. We worked hard to catch Solomon. But he killed our officers and escaped. He killed your colleagues in my police station, ma'am. I was the circle inspector there. In addition to your officers, he murdered all my fellow policemen. I want to take him back to India at any cost. So, I've sought help from Veerayya as I had no other choice. Are you guys foolish? This is his kingdom. It's not easy to take him from here. Listen to me, pack your things and leave immediately. What? We should leave? My deal is worth Rs. 25 lakh. I'll get the money only if I take him back to India. I will give you Rs. 25,000. Share it amongst yourselves and keep quiet. How dare you? Do you know who you are talking to? Oh, my God! It's Solomon Caesar. All of you go away. Disperse. Keep it there. Veeru bro! You are a brave guy, brother. You are a brave guy, too. Please sit. Did you see any of their faces? It wasn't possible. All of them had masks on their faces. Haven't you caught them yet? We've checked all the hospitals. No one is being treated for bullet injuries. I think they are very well trained. No matter how well-trained they are, they cannot escape from me, Abdullah. Leave it. Brotherâ€¦ I want to give you something. Ask what you want, I'll give it to you. Noâ€¦ You cannot give it. Try me. You will not give it. I know that. -So, I won't ask. -Just tell me what you want. Will you come to India? Will you come to India with me? What? My popularity will increase only if you go to India with me. Only then will people know that I'm doing business with big shots like Solomon Caesar. It will raise my profile. It will be awesome. Okay. I will come to India. Solomon, no. Only for you. Congratulations, Brother-in-law. Well done, sir. -You can wipe it, sir. -Wash it in the bathroom, sir. It's this way, sir. On the right hand side. It's on right hand side. We got away. Shit! Solomon, that bathroom is for my personal use. It's okay. We are friends now. Solomon, are you done? Wipe your hands. Come on. Let's go now. I think it's the water tap. It is not turned off properly. Let's go. Veeru-- Sir? Sorry, sir. Is this why it's your personal space? Yes, Solomon! You are right. She is my hotel manager. I have wooed her. You are a naughty guy, bro. I won't ruin it. -Enjoy yourself, bro. -Thanks. Veeru, you are superb. You have easily achieved something that we thought was impossible. Thank you. You are unbelievable. If you are Sita, I am your Rama If you are Radha, I am your Krishna If you are Laila, I am your Majnu If you are Juliet, I am your Romeo Come on, Let's fall in love My grace and your smile Will make a rocking combo Come on, Let's fall in love My grace and your smile Will make a rocking combo If you are a song, I am its tune If you are a word, I am its meaning If you are the rain, I am the cloud If you are the Veena, I'm its strings Come on, Let's fall in love Your grace and my smile Will make a rocking combo Come on, Let's fall in love My grace and your smile Will make a rocking combo If you are a dove, I am your starling If you are a queen, I am your king If you are a heroine, I am your hero If you are Srideviâ€¦ Then what? I am Chiranjeevi! Come on, Let's fall in love My grace and your smile Will make a rocking comboâ€¦ Did you find out who attacked my brother? Boss, I think they left the city right after they attacked us. Hey, fool! They didn't come to kill my brother. They came to capture him. They didn't run away. A gang has come from India. They are staying at our hotel. What? Listen to me carefully. Veerayya, the final hearing will take place soon. The case will be dismissed if you are not here. Come back soon. Veeruâ€¦ My boss wants to see you now urgently. Lord Subrahmanya, please save us. Please keep us safe. Do you think I am a fool, Veeru? Is it easy to kidnap me? There was a lot of scheming behind my back by those who I trusted. I couldn't sense it then. We are all done for. John! Oh, my! My guest relations manager, who is in a relationship with you. They are the ones who attacked me at the party. Their plan failed thanks to your interference. Veeru, we were just trying to find the guy who had been hit by a bullet. But my brother was very shrewd in his thinking. In caseâ€¦ In caseâ€¦ Had their plan succeeded, how would they have taken me back to India? I focused on all the possibilities. Then I found out their plan. They had hired a charter flight to take me with them. My brother got their booking details. I tapped all their phones. And I've come to know that they are Indian RAW agents. Are you wondering why I haven't killed them yet? We found something interesting in their conversations. It's a big surprise! Abdullah. Shall I send extra men to ensure the plan doesn't fail like it happened last time? No need, sir. We have met a gang here. I have full confidence in the gang leader's capabilities. This time the bridegroom will come to India for his honeymoon. Veeru, do you know whom they are calling the bridegroom? It's me. By honeymoon, they mean taking me to India. Is that all? -Veeruâ€¦ -Boss! Your brother is on a video call. Come and tell us who that gang leader is. Don't say that you won't reveal his name no matter what we do. Don't bore us with such dialogues. Say something new. -Go to hell! -Sure. Solomonâ€¦ Same to you. Solomon, what happened? Leader The gang leader He's like thunder He will never surrender He is the gang leader Leader The gang leader Fast like a fighter plane, Spinning like a hurricane The one and only gang leader Veeru! VEERAYYA His name is not Veeru. It's Veerayya. Yes, it's Veerayya. I am Waltair Veerayya. I am the gang leader you were searching for. Did you come for me? Is there any doubt? He's my bait. And you are my prey! What are you saying, Veerayya? Yes. I did not become a part of your story. You've all become a part of my story. I have come here only to get him. Did you think I'd let you go free if you left the country? I won't let you get away. You will come to bury your brother if I kill him. He will come here. He will come to see you die at my hands. I will surely come there if you die. Come on! Whether the sea is turbulent or calm, Veerayya will always be on a fishing expedition. If I hit it with my oar, even a whale must fall into my net. You will soon be dragged back to India. To keep your spirits up until then, you can keep looking at my name etched on your chest. You scumbag! Hey, set it right! A raging fire! He is a real man! He is the cannonball That burns down the enemy He can end a war in no time He is a one-man phenomenon And the lonely traveler His voice sends A shiver down the spine of his enemies He is the source of all power Veerayya! Veerayya! Veerayya! Veerayya! Veerayya! Veerayya! Boss? There's a guy coming after me. I'm leading him to the carnival. Call our men. Okay. He hunts down the beasts He is the flame That burns to punish the wicked He has consumed poison To shield others from harm He is the trident that challenges the evil He sounds the death knell for wrongdoers He sits atop a tall branch Like a red pigeon He is the lofty mountain peak That can never be conquered He stands tall among men Veerayya!

HYSTERIA LOADINGâ€¦ You will come to bury your brother if I kill him. My story begins with his death. 4 YEARS AGO KADAPA -What's that sound? -What's going on? For the first time, I see a tiger carrying a lamb. What's the matter, ACP? Have you come here to kneel before me and beg me to cancel your transfer order? The transfer order won't come into effect for another hour. I received a complaint against you. I have come here to look into it. Which guy has the guts to complain against me? A guy? No, it's a female. -A female? -Yes. When the little one was trying to have breakfast with her mother, your men kidnapped her mother. I received a complaint. Nobody dares to question us even when we slaughter men like lambs. All right, I slaughtered her mother to cook lunch for us. Wait for a while. I'll eat the meat and throw you some bones. I thought it was a kidnap case. This looks like a murder case. Hey, the goat is just an excuse. Kill him. Not enough? Sir, I didn't eat non-veg. I am a vegetarian. You ate a lot of lamb curry. You're the next one to be beaten to a pulp. Run away. You have to answer to the government for the bullets you use. Hey, why are you making a fuss? You still don't get me. I don't give a damn about what anyone says. Sirâ€¦ What is it? Where are you headed next? It seems a tiger has been going on a rampage in Vizag as there is no hunter around. I am heading there next. Yo! This is not a swag song! This is a mega swag song! Hey, pour your heart out! Make merry and enjoy yourself When the boss swings into a party With his moves It's going to be a blast Forget the lyrics, Just dance to the beats! Don't stop dancing, Hysteria loadingâ€¦ Don't stop dancing, Hysteria loadingâ€¦ Just swirl around and hit the floor Let it reverberate through the town Come, greet and salute, It's our place Just whistle and raise the decibels Forget the lyrics, Just dance to the beats! Don't stop dancing, Hysteria loadingâ€¦ Don't stop dancing, Hysteria loadingâ€¦ He twists and turns like a snake! It's all your blessings, sister! -Why did he come here? Let's go. -Bossâ€¦ Hey! What? Don't stop dancing, Hysteria loadingâ€¦ Come on, dear Come on, dear! One more time, please Come on! Let's dance to this peppy tune! You can hear this ring-tone Wherever you are Rock and roll The entire locality is under your control Forget the lyrics, Just dance to the beats! Don't stop dancing, Hysteria loadingâ€¦ Don't stop dancing, Hysteria loadingâ€¦ Don't stop dancing, Hysteria loadingâ€¦ Don't stop dancing, Hysteria loadingâ€¦ How dare you hit our guy? Move aside! Take them into custody. -Hey! -Veerayyaâ€¦ Uncle, how dare he come here and attack my people! Those guys are not from your locality. They are outsiders. Stay calm. I didn't come here to dance. I am here to give a warning. There are drug-related cases against these fellows. I have come to arrest them. -Who is he? -The new assistant commissioner of police. Everybody, listen up! All the criminals and crooks in this area should report to my police station tomorrow. Do you understand? -Me? -Yes! You too should be there. -Uncle, he calls me to his station. -Just come there once. Boss, why did you back down before this guy? You don't cow down to anybody. I will deal with this guy in front of his dad. Mr. Sathyamurthyâ€¦ Come down, sir. Let's have a drink. Come, Descend from the sky to the earthâ€¦ Hey, no! Don't mix soda. You know that I drink it raw. That's why your liver got damaged and you died so soon. Son, I beg you. Please put a fresh garland around my photo. This one stinks. Dad, don't remove it. I will get a new one for next Sankranti. Okay. Come on, cheers! Eat it. Did you cook all these delicacies? No, my wife made them. You got married? Where is my daughter-in-law? Vanajakshi, come here. You father-in-law wants to meet you. Take his blessings. -She is coming. -Come, dear. -I will thrash you with my shoe. -I am your father! That's why I spared you. You got married twice. So, no one is willing to give me his daughter's hand in marriage. Let's have one more round. My dear dadâ€¦ Did my mother actually die? Or did you kill her? Hey, why would I kill her? Your mother meant the world to me. She left you in my care and passed away. I didn't recover from that loss for a month. Is that why you married the cashier, Saroja, within a month after Mom's death and welcomed her into this house? Why do you put it like that? I went to the supermarket to buy some baby formula for you. And you started crying for your mother. Saroja, who was the teller there, took you in her arms and comforted you. That's when I realized that you needed a mother. Though I didn't want it, I had to marry her for your sake. Dad, if you married her so reluctantly, how come she became pregnant within the next three months? Because you needed someone to play with. So, for my sake, you brought in a step-mother and gave me a brother. And you didn't do anything for your own happiness! No, son. Dad, you are not an ordinary man, but an extremely self-sacrificing man. He is fully drunk now. -I'll leave now. -Hey, put it down. Tell me something. If you really loved me so much, why did you send me to public school but put my brother in a private school? They didn't want you as you were not so intelligent. Are you saying that I am a dimwit? -I didn't mean it. -Stop it! Thanks to you, my step-brother, who is your younger son, has become a police officer. Now he warns me that he will shoot me dead. -Your brother is a police officer? -Yes. I knew that he would achieve something big one day. Hold my cigarette. I need to talk to my mom. My dear Thalupulamma, did you see his love for his other son? This man-- Hey, that's my smoke. Give it to me. Smoking is injurious to health. But if anyone messes with me, it'll be dangerous to his life. Convey this to your younger son. -He can't see me. -Why can't he? He is a decent guy, not a drunkard like you. What do you mean? I'm a drunkard? You bloody! How dare you call me a drunkard! -I will break yourâ€¦ -Noâ€¦ No! Father? Did you get back inside? THALUPULAMMA TALLI ICE FACTORY Kaala! Veerayya has put you in charge of his ice factory. But we have been using it to run our drug business. Just when the business is at its peak, this ACP has entered the scene. I have inquired about him. He doesn't give a damn about anyone. He is a crackpot! So, should we sit idly by? Before he zeroes in on us, let's finish him off. As long as Veerayya trusts us and we continue to store the drugs in ice blocks, even God cannot catch us. -Uncle, what is going on? -Hush! Don't hush me. He called us here, but he's playing with a kid. Does your ACP know how to spell "punctuality"? Can you spell it? I don't know. But I'm here on time. I've given you a pain killer. It will subside. Sagar, they are fine. They will be okay within an hour. Be careful next time you hit them. Who is this doctor? She seems to like violence. -Your brother's wife. -What? How come her father let her marry this guy? Theirs is a love marriage. Oh! -Does she belong to our caste? -No. She is a Malaysian Tamil girl. Oh! A mother, father, and a Tamil girl. Sounds good. Nithya, I have told you often that we have a relative here. Go and seek his blessings. Oh! That's him! Uncle, you know that I don't like such things. It's okay, boss. It's okay. -Bless me, Uncle. -God bless you, dear. I am practicing the moonwalk. -It was good. Looked perfect. -Yes. -Bye, Uncle. -Okay. The baby is staring at you. I'm her uncle. The girl can sense it even though her father didn't tell her. This is your uncle. -Bye. -Hello! Shall we get down to business? We are fishermen, sir. Don't suspect us. Your goggles are glittering. What brand is it? Gocci. It's not Gocci. It's Gucci. Apple watch, Hush Puppies slippers, and colorful T-shirts. Mine is a Rolex. Yes, I saw that Rolex. Where do you get the money to buy such exotic brands? Tell him we bought them online at a discount. -Online? -Yes. Do you think I am a fool who cannot differentiate between a shopper and a smuggler? I will thrash each one of you. You have taken advantage of the port and the open sea to bring drugs into the city. That's why I've been transferred here. Stop all these nefarious activities. Else I will have to use my gun. Drugs? In my locality? If I ever come to know that anyone from my locality is peddling drugs, I will bring his head to the police station. What are you saying, sir? We kill fish every day to make a living. So, we pray to the goddess of water to forgive us. Don't brand us as criminals, sir. You are putting up a great performance like an award-winning actor. If you overact, I will break your bones. You will break his bones? Really? Kaala, move aside. Let me tell you now. I will stop smuggling. But I'll stop it only when commoners can afford to buy foreign liquor at a cheaper price. I will stop illegal activities when every poor student gets laptops and iPads at subsidized rates. I will give up all my businesses when our women can buy Louis Vuitton and Prada bags for cheap. We have to pay bribes to eat, to sleep on a bedâ€¦ We have to pay bribes for almost everything! You are the real gang leader. Why are you talking about paying bribes? I just said it in a flow. You didn't like it? Let me tell you something now. You say that I indulge in smuggling. I say that I engage in social service. I won't stop it. Hysteria loading. Yes! -Let's go. -Let's go. Hey, mister! Turn your face a little to the left. Your boats must return to the shore with only fish from the sea. If I see any other goods in them, I'll beat you all to a pulp. You will beat us? Many police commissioners like you come and go. But Veerayya is a local and permanent resident in this city. -Don't annoy me. I'll shoot you. -I dare you to shoot me. Come on, shoot me. -Shoot me, man. -Veerayya, stop it. As long as your dad was alive, he wished to see you together. You don't have to come together. But please stop fighting. Veerayya, you can go now. Tell that to him. It's his station. You go away. The port is mine. I won't spare him if he touches it. -Go away. -I will. Let's go, guys. Even green grass catches fire If it is placed between them Even green grass catches fireâ€¦ Check it thoroughly. Sir, there's nothing here except fish. Did you expect to find flowers on a fisherman's boat? You are not a smart cop. Brotherâ€¦ I've sent the material in the cargo ship. Receive it. Even green grass catches fire If it is placed between them Even green grass catches fireâ€¦ Doctor, do you only treat kids? Can you treat men like us? Mind your tongue! I'm not talking to you. Why are you so angry? Oh, my! You don't want us teasing women in your area, right? I don't want you teasing women in any area. We have enough problems already, let's go. Doctor! This is from Veerayya. Thank you. I don't know what happened between the two of you. But I want to see you both together. This girl is gold. Whereas my brother is a son of-- Calm down, boss. I'm calm now. Hello, sir. I have told you before. He is the Joint Commissioner. He is my mentor in the department. He is one of my best officers. Boss, the ACP seized our truck which contains imported liquor. -Bloodyâ€¦ -Boss, please. Let's go and see. Comeâ€¦ -Hey! -What? Stop it. Veerayya is coming here. Hide everything, guys. What are you doing, Kaala? Your health will get affected if you keep working so late. You've entrusted me with a big responsibility. You should take care of your health. Come, let's have a drink. -Cheers! -Cheers! -What's wrong with you? -Dad loved this booze. -Oh, Lord Ram! -It's rum. No matter what, my father still loves me. Eat it up, Dad. Hey, it's flying away. Don't stop me, guys. I'll bashâ€¦ -Boss, calm down. -Hey, youâ€¦ Come. How dare you sell drugs? Where are you going? Sir! Who supplies drugs to you? Answer me. I swear on God, sir. Every week that guy comes here to supply the stock. I don't know what he looks like or what he does. But where is he now? I don't know, sir. Sir! Heyâ€¦ Haven't I told you that you should come alone to take the supplies? He is my brother-in-law. Greetings. He lives in Hyderabad. He wants to do business with you. I trust him. Not you, our boss should be able to trust him. Heyâ€¦ Take the money and give him the stuff. It's a sting operation by Vikram Sagar. Run away from here. Sir! Sorry, sirâ€¦ We missed them. We didn't miss them. Get the hunting dogs. All the men here, take off your shirts. Why, sir? Why are you talking back? If I have to get up, I'll remove your underwear too. Take them off! Hey, you! Come forward. Should I tell you separately? Take off your shirt. Stop, Kaala! Heyâ€¦ this area is under my control and that vehicle is also mine. Get down. -Govindh! -Sir! Check the license number for tickets. No need for that. Let him sit there. Ask him what the issue is. The other day, a drug dealer saw us at the beach and escaped. The police dogs led us here. -While he escaped, your brotherâ€¦ -Krishna! I have no brother. But I have many brothers. Am I right? Brother, you continue. While he tried to escape, the ACP got his nail marks on his chest. If they remove their shirts, we will know who it is, right? Please. When they can't nab the culprits, this is how they slap cases on innocents like us. Take off your shirts. Take it off, Kaala. Take it off. Why are you taking so long? Take it off! Take it offâ€¦ Take it offâ€¦ Stop it. Why are you making it worse, Kaala? Take it off-- VEERAYYA Kaalaâ€¦ my name on yourâ€¦ What is this? You take care of us like your brothers though we are strangers. So I got your name tattooed on my chest. You've touched meâ€¦ You've touched me. You want to hurt such innocent people. Sir, we found the shirt in this canal. Brotherâ€¦ so many things get washed ashore, does it mean they are ours? Hey, shut up! He is here. If he comes out, I will treat him well. Else I will lock everyone up. Lock us up, I dare you! If you have the guts, try me. -The jeep is hereâ€¦ Come, let's go. -Let's go, brother. -Police ruleâ€¦ -Down, down! You may be so diligent, but Veerayya is innocent! -Innocent! -Innocent! Rolling stone gathers no moss, release our boss! -Release our boss! -Release our boss! -To hell with the ACP! -To hell with the ACP! -ACPâ€¦ -Down, down! Look, there lies Ashoka Chakra. Here is ACP Vikram. Here's an excellent cop to take on Waltair Veerayya. Hey, Bujji, once I come out, your ass is gonna melt. What is the matter? -Can I take a selfie with you? -Come. Thank you. Smile please. Sir, it's not enough to put Veerayya in the lockup. You should instil fear in him. He should cry for his dad from your ruthless beatings. Get up. How did I end up here? His ruthless beatings put you in here. Why did he hit me when I spoke about your dad? Get up. What did you say? Why did he hit me when I spoke about your dad? Why are you both hitting me for talking about your fathers? Don't you get it yet? His father and his father are the same. Happy Fathers' Day. -ACPâ€¦ -Down, down! Sir, I just got the information. They've found the corpse of a guy who escaped last night, near Yarada Beach. That's it. People are agitated outside. It'll be a hassle if the media finds out. Release them immediately. Veerayya, you can leave. -Come onâ€¦ -Wait. The ACP should apologize for locking up innocent people like us. -He should apologize. -Yeah. The only word I don't like in Telugu is sorry. That's an English word, brother. -It became a Telugu word recently. -So what? Hey, watch it! You drunkard, why are you driving like this on such a wide road? -I did it on purpose. -Why? -I did that to his face for locking us up. -Who? You did a good job. Well doneâ€¦ You are correct. Stop, stop, stop. -Okay, boss. -Come fast. What are you doing, brother? Nothingâ€¦ I am throwing more mud on his face. -Is it? Then we will also join you. -Heyâ€¦ no, no. I can't stand to see even a blot on his face. How can I allow thisâ€¦ I will kill you all. You'll kill us? When you love him so much, why do you fight him? Heyâ€¦ do we need a reason to fight among step-brothers? As I lost my mother, my father used to show some affection towards me. His mother couldn't stand that. That is the reason she never allowed him to address me as brotherâ€¦ -He never called you brother? -Noâ€¦ Yesâ€¦ He called me brother once. At that timeâ€¦ I must've been this tall. I was playing with marbles under a tree. He was climbing that tree to get to a kite. Veerayya! -Hey, your brother is calling you. -We'll see when he calls me brother. Veerayyaâ€¦ Veerayyaâ€¦ Brotherâ€¦ Brotherâ€¦ Brotherâ€¦ I am going to fall down, Brother. Help me, please. I am scared, Brother. Come fast, Brother. Brotherâ€¦ Brotherâ€¦ -I'm falling down, Brother. -I'm coming, Brother. Brotherâ€¦ Brotherâ€¦ Brotherâ€¦ Brotherâ€¦ -Brotherâ€¦ -Brotherâ€¦ Careful! Step-mom, please trust me. I really fainted. -You tell her, Brotherâ€¦ -Step-mom, please don't go. Stop your drama. If you really treat him like your brother, why didn't you help him? Noâ€¦ It's not thatâ€¦ He felt dizzy, didn't heâ€¦ Even now you are concerned about your eldest son who was feeling dizzyâ€¦ But you don't care about him who has suffered a fracture. I can't stay in such a placeâ€¦ Come on. Brother, I really felt dizzy. Step-mom, I swear on my mother. Are you swearing on your dead mother? Or on me as you want me to die? Hey, shut up. I married you so that you can become his mother. If you act like his step-mother, then I won't stop you. Come on. -Step-momâ€¦ Please don't go. -Get lost. Please tell her, Brother. It was nothing new for my step-mom to yell at me and go away with my step-brother. She had done it many times before but she used to always come back. But after that, she didn't come back. Since then, he grew up without a father and I, without a mother. Veerayya, I am here for you. Let them go. Only after I turned 25 did I find out that my problem is called vertigo. I wrote so many letters about it to my brother. I sent so many letters. But I never got a response. Why do you all look so blurry? You are crying, boss. Me? I never cryâ€¦ No, no, Iâ€¦ Oh, myâ€¦ My eyes are welling up with tears. Whatever it is, mine is a one-sided love. That's itâ€¦ Oh, no, the cops are hereâ€¦ What happened? Why are you running away? -Who is that? Oh, him. -Vikram, stop. Vikram, shall we drop him home? He is alone. Nithya! For my sake, Vikram, please. Look at my lungiâ€¦ To hell with the crowd-- -Helloâ€¦ -Yesâ€¦ Who? Look here. Yes, tell me. -Where were you at this hour? -I'm coming from the cinemas. Where is the ticket? They let you in only after tearing the ticket. You husband doesn't even know that. Go on. Fine, get in. -Get in! -Why should I? I-I will. Get down. Ohâ€¦ We've reached our area, is it? Thanksâ€¦ My brother dropped me here. Did anyone see that? I'm sure no one saw it. Bloody drunkards. Dad, did you see that? You will come down only when I ring the bell. My brother dropped me homeâ€¦ To hell with the crowd Who didn't see thatâ€¦ -Hey, Yesuâ€¦ -Sir! Where are the ice blocks? I delivered an order to a school. What happened, sir? Why would you send it to a school? Thou art the ruler Of the minds of all people Dispenser of India's destiny Thy name rouses the hearts Of Punjab, Sindhu, Gujarat and Maratha Of the Dravida and Odisha and Bengal It echoes in the hills Of the Vindhyas and Himalayas Mingles in the music of Yamuna and Ganges, Chanted by the waves of the Indian Sea Victory, victory, victory! Victory to thee! Don't hurry, come slowly. There's enough for everyone. Hurry up, hurry up! Be careful, come on! Heyâ€¦ Heyâ€¦ Sriâ€¦ Sri! Dear Sriâ€¦ Sri! Get up! What's the reason behind the children's death? What happened? Nurse, get the oxygen cylinder quickly. Sagar, this is not food poisoning. There are traces of cocaine in the children's bodies. -Cocaine? -Yes. It was mixed in their soft drinks. Due to the high dose of cocaine, the kids died of dehydration. -Nurse, take care. -How many? Nithya, how many kids? Twenty five kids are dead. It's an unfortunate situation. The guilty shall be punished. Tell me what you mixed in the drink. I don't know. We bought ice from outside and mixed it in the drink, that's it. Ice? Where did you buy it from? We got it from Veerayya's ice factory, sir. It's the truth, sirâ€¦ Please believe me. What? Did your brother drop you? Yes. I swear. I'm telling the truth. My brother dropped me here. Didn't I tell you not to change the brand you drink? You did and now it's giving you side effects. -True! -Tell me. The ice blocks were delivered to a schoolâ€¦ 25 kids are dead. Do you think so? Only Kaala can confirm the truth. Tell him, Kaala. Why is he leaving? What's wrong with him? Vikram Sagar is coming to arrest Veerayya. Don't be anywhere around him. Why did Kaala leave like that? Kaalaâ€¦ What, Uncle? Why have you come with an entire battalion? Is he worried about me? Why do you come so often? Hey, they found drugs in your ice factory. What are you saying, Uncle? -Noâ€¦ -Yes. Twenty five kids are dead because of the contaminated ice from your factory. Kids are dead? -No, there must have been a mistake. -Why are you talking to him? Will you get in the vehicleâ€¦ Or should I drag you? Will you drag-- -Police rule! -Down, down! Move. -Police rule! -Down, down! Outâ€¦ Outâ€¦ Outâ€¦ The people of Vizag are demanding death penalty for Veerayya, the one responsible for the children's death. Veerayya is responsible for the children's death. So they are demanding to hang him. Hey, Kaalaâ€¦ They've found drugs in your ice factory. This is your ice factory, I've to take care of it, right? VEERAYYA Uncle, did you find out anything about Kaala? My brother kept telling me, Uncle. That something was happening in my area. I turned a deaf ear to it. Let me catch him and I will make him fess up. I won't spare him, wherever he is. It's time to wind up our business in India. I am coming to Malaysia. Make the arrangements. What about our stuff? Heyâ€¦ Do you think I'd abandon the stuff that's worth crores of rupees? It's in the evidence room, and I am getting that. The police hereby confirm that the people of Jalaripeta have robbed the drugs kept under police custody as evidence. Many say that this is a glaring example of sheer negligence by the cops. What the hell are you guys doing? Have you come to tell that Jalaripeta people erased all the evidence? What a shame! The focus of national media is on us. We cannot produce Veerayya in the court without any evidence, sir. He will come out easily. You are rightâ€¦ If people shouldn't lose their trust in us, there is only one other option. To encounter Veerayya. -What do you say, Vikram? -What would I say, sir? He is responsible for the death of 25 children. It's your call, sir. Since Vikram is Veerayya's brother, I will handle this encounter. -Who the hell are you? -Shut up! Remove the mask. Kaala! You? How could you stab our brother in the back? Oh, that's your problem? I'll stab him in the front nowâ€¦ Do you know the value of the stuff your people took? Crores of rupees. Tell me where the stuff is. Heyâ€¦ Where is that Vikram? Uncleâ€¦ He is the ACP. Show some respect. Why should I respect him? Does he want to get a medal for encountering his own brother? -Where is my gun? Where is it? -Uncleâ€¦ Uncleâ€¦ -Heyâ€¦ -You shouldn't take it outâ€¦ What if he doesn't care? I will go and save Veerayya. Uncleâ€¦ Uncleâ€¦ Don't open the door. Please, listen to me. What, Uncle? What happened? If you are here, then who is there? What are you saying? Yes, he knows that you don't have anything to do with this case. So he went instead of you. As long as I am here, even the God of Death cannot touch my brother. Let's not kill each other. Just tell me where my stuff is. I will take that and leaveâ€¦ Hey! It's not the people of Jalaripeta who took your stuff from the evidence room. It was me. I laid the trap to catch the rats, but look at you! Sir, please take my people from hereâ€¦ I will see who will cross me. There's no other option. You should take us to our stuff. Kill him! Come onâ€¦ I will play death beats on your chests. Don't stop me, Uncleâ€¦ My brother is alone thereâ€¦ I should go. Why are you here? Lock him up! Sir, just give me 30 minutes. I will come back for sure. Please. Tell him, Uncleâ€¦ Sir, just give me 30 minutes. The ACP is in danger, sir. Hey! He will speak the truth once I put an end to you. Hey, Kaala! My stuff is worth croresâ€¦ His life is worth even more to youâ€¦ I'll kill him-- Your neck will be on the ground if you dare to hurt him. What are you still thinking about? Hey, I'll kill youâ€¦ He's one of my best officers. You are my inspiration, sir. And I'm proud if it. What is this, sir? Yesâ€¦ He joined hands with me because his government salary is not enough. Vikram Sagar is coming to arrest Veerayyaâ€¦ Don't be anywhere around him. One shocking news, sirâ€¦ ACP Vikram Sagar turned out to be a rogue. What? He killed our escort team. He let his brother escape. Stop him at any costâ€¦ Kill him if needed. Sure, sir. Official-- I will make your last words your death statement. Then the case against both the brothers will get stronger. Brotherâ€¦ Brotherâ€¦ Chinna! -Chinna! -Brother! He is running awayâ€¦ Don't worry, I'll take care of him. Chinna, let's go to a hospital. Come on. -Don't let him go, Brotherâ€¦ -No, I won't let him go. Chinna! Come onâ€¦ Let's go. Chinnaâ€¦ Careful! Brotherâ€¦ Hold onâ€¦ We're almost there. It is my expiry date. I know it. Don't say that. They say that you see your entire life moments before your death. All I can see is youâ€¦ My heart is filled with happiness. -What are you sayingâ€¦ -Oneâ€¦ cigarette pleaseâ€¦ My mother gave me your letters on her deathbed. I read-- I understood your feelings, but there were so many spelling mistakes. I was staying away from you because of the ongoing investigation. I wanted to share a drink with you once everything was over. We will do that, we will share a drink. If there were two stabs less, I would have killed him. Heyâ€¦ Chinna, don't close your eyes. Heyâ€¦ Get up, don't close your eyes. Don't cryâ€¦ It doesn't suit you. Smile, pleaseâ€¦ I would like to see you smile. I am a big fan of your smile since my childhoodâ€¦ Brother, you should keep smiling throughout your life. Okay. Chinna! Chinna! Brotherâ€¦ Heyâ€¦ Brotherâ€¦ Brotherâ€¦ It has been proved that ACP Vikram Sagar, who died on duty, was involved with the drug mafia. To save his brother, Vikram Sagar attacked his fellow cops and also became responsible for the death of a few. The police department has decided not to accord state honors to the funeral of Vikram Sagar, who brought shame to the department. Vaishnavi! Dadâ€¦ Hey, dearâ€¦ It's nothing. I was playing with you. If something happens to me, then many cops will come over. They'd wrap my body in the national flag and fire guns to honor me and then salute. If a cop dies on duty, then he is treated as a hero. Where are the salutes and tributes? Why are you talking like that to a child, Vikram? My daughter should also know that it's an honor for a cop to die on duty. Where are the gallantry medals? Where is the respect? Are you gone? Are you gone? Are you gone, leaving me alone? Are you gone? Are you gone? Are you gone, leaving me alone? Your handsâ€¦ I know that my husband was honest and duty-bound until his last breath. But the world doesn't believe soâ€¦ Instead of performing his funeral with the guard of honor, he is being cremated like an abandoned corpse. You are the reason for it! Why haven't the cops come here to see my father? Is my father a bad cop? Noâ€¦ What happened wasâ€¦ Stop. Don't come near my daughter. We were happy when you were away. Please don't come into our lives again. Bearing slander, bearing infamyâ€¦ Did you leave with a heavy heart? You have suffered defeat Where you should have won You left in the middle of the gameâ€¦ At that point in time, I didn't have anything to say to her. Nor did I have any evidence to prove my brother's innocence. Unable to bear the hate, my sister-in-law left the country with her family. To prove his honesty, I filed a case in the courtâ€¦ To win the case, Kaala should come to the court and confess. I've searched every nook and corner for news about him. -Do you know Kaala? -I don't know. You came to me at a time when I was searching for Kaala frantically. Only two days left for the final hearing in the court. By then, I should bring Michael to the court and make him confess. My sister-in-law should come to India and live with dignity. My brother's daughter should realize that her father was indeed a hero. How do we take Michael Caesar to India in the current situation, Veerayya? I won't take himâ€¦ I will make it so that he begs me to take him away from here. Michael! I gave you Rs. 2,000 crore, trusting that you'd deliver the stuff. But someone infiltrated your area and killed your brother. You forgot about my deal while trying to hunt him down. Until Michael kills that bugger, he won't accept any deal. That's why I got them into the field. Then what about my deal? Michael, why do you care about giving him an explanation? Kill his brother, then he will understand. I sacrificed my own brother-in-law for the businessâ€¦ If something goes wrong with this deal, I'll kill as many people as it takes. By 10 am tomorrow, you will receive the stuff. You can go. Get the stuff in a container. I will come and check it. Start the car. Leader! Gang leader! He is like a thunder He will never surrenderâ€¦ Veerayya! No matter how much you torture me, I will not tell you the details of Michael's deal. Abdullah! I am asking you one last time. I'll tell you! Dear Athidhiâ€¦ It's not safe for you to stay in this country for long. I will use my contacts to send you all back to India on a boat. -Please leave. -Please. I won't leave you in this situation. I am ready to take any risk to bring Michael back to India along with you. Not only to his mission, but she has connected to him too. Hey, come on, man What finesse when she walks Yeah. Sending shivers down my body You are right. I'm losing control just watching her True. I'm confused, Not knowing where to begin Oh, no! Hey girl, hey girl Walk not with such grace Don't ensnare me with your beauty You are so beautiful, I am so impatient! Hello boy, hello boy, Don't come bedecked here Don't enter my heart And light up fireworks You are so handsome, I am so impatient! What finesse when she walks Yes. Sending shivers down my body You are right. I'm losing control just watching her True. I'm confused, not knowing where to begin Oh, God. Don't wear a green saree And bewitch me Such that my race car paces up, Not come thither Don't wear dark glasses, And feign not to ogle me Lest my glamor flows Into uncharted territory Oh, noâ€¦ Don't let the current in me Turn violent by coming here! Don't melt my heart By prancing around here You are so beautiful, I am so impatient! Don't pose like James Bond And point at me with a flowery gun Don't come near me as I may plant kisses Don't move your lips around mine, Or leave a hiatus between our hips If my love pulse is stimulated, The mistake is yours Don't button down your shirt To activate the manly magnet in you Like plus and minus signs, Don't short-circuit by coming here You are so beautiful, I am so impatient! You are also so handsome, I am so impatient! I'm so confused, don't know how to startâ€¦ Guys, Veerayya must have found out about our route after kidnapping Abdullah. We'll go in two trucks on the same route and finish him. Mani, get the truck with the stash and take a different route. Yes, boss. Guys, let's go. Veerayya, you guessed it right. Michael has changed his plan. Yes, the containers have gone separate ways. -We should take over the three trucksâ€¦ -Alright! Yes! -Is he here? -No, sir, it's a toll plaza. Hello! Hey, Kaala, are you waiting for me? Yes, I am waiting for you. You tried to rob my stash. Are you scared now? Scared? Your stash and your truck are both in my hands now. Hey, hey, hey! That stash is meant for Karuppan. Where are you taking it? I will send you and your stash to where it is supposed to reach. Hey, Kaalaâ€¦ Hold on for some time. Heyâ€¦ What do you mean? Michael has sent the stash. Check it out. Hey, Anbuâ€¦ Are you on the line? Yesâ€¦ I am on the line. What is your scheme? A for appleâ€¦ B for ballâ€¦ C for catâ€¦ -D for-- -D for dog. What of it now? For a changeâ€¦ Your 2,000 croresâ€¦ Damn! Robertâ€¦ What is happening outside? I'll tell you. Boss, a huge bomb blast. Veerayya has surrounded our trucks with a big gang. Veerayya's people are outside. Attack! Fire! Fire! Wait. Guys. Veerayya! Are you there or not? I am here. Hey. Why did you bring me to Karuppan? You want to destroy my kingdom and rule Malaysia alone? Is this your sketch? Hey, wait. Not a single person should escape from here! You idiotâ€¦ Stop this nonsense. Moveâ€¦ Hey, Veerayyaâ€¦ Come out and tell him the truth. Did you now realize the value of truth, Kaala? Tell Karuppan that you are behind this. Else, I will shoot you. Shoot meâ€¦ But I am the only one who has a plan to escort you to safety from here. Will you come with me to India and confess in the court? What do you think? That I am an idiot? Tell me. Will you come? Will you come with me or will you die here? Only four of them are left in your paid army. Decide soon. They are coming in batches. Heyâ€¦ Over there! Heyâ€¦ Take me out of here! Will you confess in the court? I will! I will confess! Don't let them escape! If he starts, it's explosions all over If you cross him, there brews a fiery, Smoky, fuming destruction He's a violent war force, there's no mercy The sound of his entry Is that of a tsunami Enmity with Veerayya is a one-sided battle An atom bomb is his alias Just move! If you come this way or that way, He will punch you Just move! He will hit the brakes only After your skull breaks! Just move! Steering or gearing, daring and firing, He will break all rules! Just move! He gifts you danger and turns Your body into an Egyptian mummy! Veerayyaâ€¦ There's a big canyon here and we can't go anywhere. Hey, why are you checking the time? Are you fixing the time for my death? They are coming. I am begging you, Veerayyaâ€¦ Take the gun and shootâ€¦ What are you doing? Yesâ€¦ Superb! Veerayya, superb! Comeâ€¦ Come onâ€¦ A little downâ€¦ Take him backâ€¦ Take him backâ€¦ Veerayya, come onâ€¦ We got hit! -A little downâ€¦ -I am taking off. No! Veerayyaâ€¦ Come onâ€¦ Come onâ€¦ Fast. Veerayyaâ€¦ Come onâ€¦ -Go closer to himâ€¦ -Noâ€¦ It is dangerous, ma'am. -Veerayya, come on! -No, he can't. -He has vertigo. He will faint if he-- -Shut up! Shut up, you bloodyâ€¦ -Please go closer! -No, ma'am. Veerayya! Brotherâ€¦ Hold my hand, Brotherâ€¦ Come on, Brotherâ€¦ Don't look down, Brotherâ€¦ Look only at me, Brotherâ€¦ Come on, Brotherâ€¦ Come on, Brotherâ€¦ Come on, Veerayya. Give me your hand. Come onâ€¦ Come on! After hearing the arguments in the caseâ€¦ I appreciate the efforts of Veerayya for fighting for his brother's honor, who was a sincere police officer. Closing the case without making proper inquiry was a blemish to the police department. To rectify this, I hereby order the department to amend their mistake by conducting the full state honors to ACP Vikram Sagar. The court regrets that Veerayya had to be jailed for four years when he was innocent. Veerayya, you can ask for any compensation without any hesitation. Sirâ€¦ With your permissionâ€¦ The court sentenced me to four years in prison. But my brother gave me a lifelong punishment and died in my hands. My face doesn't look good if I cryâ€¦ So, he has made me promise that I will always smileâ€¦ In order to keep my word, I am fighting my tears. I have lived all these years wearing a smile, sirâ€¦ Only I know how painful it was, sirâ€¦ My brother didn't do anything wrong and I wanted to prove that, sir. Today, that is proven. But there's still one wish left. Brother, those poor children. Justice should be served to those mothers who lost their children. Don't leave him. He should be beheaded. I should see it from heaven. David! Forgive me, sir. I know it's wrong to do this in the courtâ€¦ But I don't have a choice. You said that I served jail time while being innocent. Consider all my crimes and give me a sentence after tallying the time that I've already spent in prison, I'll go voluntarily. Vikram Sagar had joined the police force at a very youngâ€¦ Parade, attention! Raise your gun! Thank you, Uncle. -You made my father a hero. -It's for you, dear. I wish everyone has a brother like him. -Your Bobby &amp; team Burning fire! He is the real man! He saves the world He is the second sun He is the very sibling Of the God of Oceans He is the slayer of all malefic forces! He is like Sage Vasishta who meditates Amidst fury all around! He is the specialist who severs heads! Veerayya! Veerayya! Veerayya! Veerayya!
