[MUSIC - PAT BOONE, "I LOVE YOU"] - (SINGING) It's spring again. And birds on the wing again. Start to sing again the old melody. - Ladies and gentlemen, Pat Boone and Family. (SINGING) Spring is here. Spring is here. [MUSIC - BOONE FAMILY, "EASE ON DOWN THE ROAD"] - It's "Pat Boone and Family's Easter Special." With guest stars John Byner, Katherine Helmond, and Ted Knight. Starring Pat Boone, Shirley Boone. With Cherry, Lindy, Debby, and Laurey Boone. And we'll be right back. [applause] - Hi, folks. Welcome to my Easter special. Of course, an Easter special means that spring is here, and none too soon, right? We've had quite a severe winter all over. Snow in Palm Springs. Blizzards in Chicago. And tornadoes at Lee Marvin's house. Of course, out here in Los Angeles, a severe winter means keeping a heating pad next to your Jacuzzi. And if it's really bad, zipping the lining into your tennis shorts. Really, though, the essence of spring is, uh, is sharing it with people you love. I think I'm a little ahead of the game in that respect because I got a lot of folks right here in my house to share it with. My wife Shirley, my four daughters. And, oh! Speaking of daughters, have you heard the news? Debby is engaged. I'm going to be a father-in-law again. And, uh, I'm just a little bit-- [doorbell ringing] I love that doorbell. Who could that be, I wonder? - Hi, April Love! - John Byner! - Well, you ready to go? - Ready to go? - Well, don't you remember? - The basketball game. - Now you got it, pal of mine. You got your Los Angeles Lakers, your New York Knickerbockers, your hot dogs, your peanuts, your bucket o' suds, which in your case is a glass of milk with bubble bath in it. An afternoon no man will ever forget. - John, I'm not going. - I'll never forget this. Why? - Well, if you must know-- - I must know, Pat. - I'm having a father-daughter chat with Debby this afternoon. - Oh, what part you going to play? - John, look, she's getting married in a few months. And, and I'm her daddy. It's my responsibility to teach her the facts of life. - It's a lecture or show and tell? - Will you be serious? - Pat, did it ever occur to you that she might already know? - Yeah, it occurred to me. I broke out in hives, but it occurred to me. - Patty Pat-Pat, Patty Pat-Pat, Pat, Patty! The facts of life are a beautiful, wonderful, natural thing. - I know they are, if you're married. But if you're single, it's a no-no. - Call me crazy. I don't mind a no-no once in a while. Come on now, Debby's been on the road. - I know she's been on the road. But she, she doesn't know about all that stuff. - How can you tell? - Because when Debby travels, I travel with her. - Well, what are you, an American Express card? She can't leave home without you? - You've known us a long time. You know we're a close family. - Well, if you're a close family, why did it take 22 years to tell the girl the facts of life? - Because up till now, I hoped she didn't need them. - Well, why don't you go to the game. You can call her during halftime and tell her. - John! I can't do that over the phone. - Well, why don't you call her down during halftime and she can meet you in the parking lot. - John, hey, look, look, go ahead to the game without me. - It's not the same without you, Pat. I mean, who else when a Laker misses a shot yells "jeepers"? - I know I'm a lot of fun. But I got to have this talk with Debby. - Aw, it shouldn't take the whole afternoon. Now here's what you tell her. You say, look, Debby, there's a man. There's a woman. And, bingo, they're different. Huh? And you say, do you love this guy? She'll say, yes. You say, great. Meet you at the wedding. - John, it's not enough. I've got to let Debby know that the love between a man and a woman is clean and, and tasteful, and wholesome. - "Tasteful and wholesome"? That's not love. That's the Pillsbury Bake-Off. - John, this is a family tradition. I'll have a talk with Debby just like I did with, with Cherry and Lindy. - Well, how'd it go with them? - Terrific. I learned a lot. - Well, good. Let them tell Debby. And we'll go to the game. - Hey John, John! I've got an idea. - What? - I'll leave Debby a fatherly note. And then we'll talk about it later, OK? - OK. - Tell you what. You write it for me, will you? Just write what I say. We'll be there in time for the tip-off. - OK. - All right, um, "To whom it may concern." - Oh, Patty Pat. - I'm just kidding. That's too formal. "Dear Debby, your mother and I love you very much. But the kind of love we have for you is different than the kind of love we have for each other. And, in turn, is different than the kind of love you'll have for your fiancee." You got it? - "Dear Deb-by." Oh, come on, John. - All right. - "And when two people love each other and decide to get married-- Now we're talking about after they're married, Debby." Underline that part. - Underline after. - "They choose to express their love in a, a special way." - Now we're getting to the good part, huh? The special hm-mm heh-heh-hee. - "I know that you're a mature, intelligent young lady, who's sophisticated enough to, uh, have an idea how a man and woman, uh, perpetuate themselves. I love you and, just as importantly, respect you. There's no reason for you to be shy about asking me anything. That's what I'm here for. Love, Daddy." - P.S. - P.S.? - "P.S. If you want to know anything else, call me during halftime at the Laker game." - I'm going to sign that. - La-ker game. - All right. - Sign it. - Great idea, huh? - OK, now let's go watch some big guys sweat. - Oh, uh, John, will you refresh me on one thing, uh-- - What's that? - Which one lays the egg? The bird or the bee? - Gee, that's one I don't know, Pat. - What are you doing in here? Making a Technicolor omelet? - No. I'm making some Easter eggs for Ryan and Jessica. - Oh, yeah! These are really nice, Laurey. - And they're all different too. - Great. - This is my Rembrandt. - I'm impressed. - You are? - Yeah. - And my van Gogh. - That's cute. - And this is my-- - Oh! And what do you call that? - I guess that's my Picasso. - John, may I speak with you just a moment? - Of course, Katherine. The Boone family seem like such nice people. - Oh, they are. They are. - Uh, but I hear, John, that Pat is very strict. - Oh, I'll say. If you talk during rehearsal, he'll send you to your dressing room without lunch. - Oh, if I don't have my lunch, I can't get through the afternoon. - Oh, I'm just kidding. - Oh. Then I won't have to eat my lunch during breakfast? - I don't think that's necessary. - Oh, I mean, I just can't stand tuna salad before noon. - I understand. - I mean, it's just so fishy. - Mm-hm. Is that what you want to talk to me about? - Uh, no, no. Is it true what you hear about the Boone's being so nice and so friendly and so healthy? - Yeah, it's true. Annoying, isn't it? - I don't know. I mean, I come from a very healthy family, too. - Ah, I was just kidding. - Oh, I couldn't tell. This is my first Boone special. - I guess that could explain it. - Are there any big don'ts? - Don'ts? - Yeah, you know, like, don't talk with your mouth full. Don't put your elbows on the table. - Well, they don't allow any murder or violence on The Pat Boone Show. - "No violence." - No smut. - "No smut." - And as far back as I can remember, there haven't been any human sacrifices. - "No human sacrifice." - Mm, that about covers it. - OK, thank you for the advice. - Mm-hm. - Oh, you didn't mention pillaging. - Well, it's never come up before. But just to be on the safe side, don't pillage. - I promise. - Hey, how you cats doing? Oh pretty good. Meow, meow. Hey, I was just telling her about the don'ts. - The don'ts? Oh, Katherine, that stuff's so exaggerated. Did you mention pillaging? - Yeah, and human sacrifice. - OK, yeah, yeah. Katherine, you're our guest here. I just want you to have a good time. You know, just think of us as a big happy family. - Oh, thank you. That's nice. - Told you he was nice. I told her you were nice. Honest. - I knew I could count on you. - Uh, Pat, you wouldn't mind if I went out tonight after the show, would you? - You can go anywhere you want. But be back by 10:00. - Sounds fair. - Mm-hm. 10 o'clock. - Hey, this is great! You know, it's the first time we've been shopping together since Jesse was born. - Hey, yea, you're right. I think I'm going to get some skate bottom jeans. - Some what? - Oh, they're just jeans that go over your skates. - For a minute there, I thought they were for someone who was built funny. - What are you going to get? - Uh, I think I got to get some disposable blouses. - Disposable? - Did I say that? Oh my gosh. With two babies in diapers, I guess that word just sort of grows on you. - I hate spring. It always reminds me of Groundhog Day. That was the day my Pa threw me outside and asked me if I could see my shadow. On Arbor Day, he'd make me stand next to a dog. Last spring, Bessie, my nearsighted cow, ran off and made it with an octopus. Don't know what they got, but it darn near milked itself to death. Ma had a special way of dying Easter eggs. She used to throw them in hot water with a cheap plaid shirt. Eggs looked good, but they'd always shrink two sizes. - That your shrunken egg joke? - Yep, you like it? - Always cracks me up. - You know, I hate to sound redundant or even repeat myself, but I just love this time of year. And one of the reasons is baseball. The excitement of spring training. Who's going to make it to the World Series? Will the Dodgers finally-- And, of course, there's Little League, too. Watching those kids play in all their unbridled enthusiasm. There's such an honesty and innocence in those kids, that it just brings out the kid in all of us. - OK, I see your raise. What do you guys got? - Kings and fours. - Not bad for a kid. But how's a full house look? Queens and deuces. - Darn, I got a hand like a foot. - Hey, gents, we're talking a straight flush. - Blump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bum, bum. Hello fellas. It's me, your new coach and manager. - Big deal. - So what. - You, you guys are the team, aren't you? - No, we're the string section of the New York Philharmonic. - You fellas don't seem to understand. You're Boone's Bombers. I'm Pat Boone. - Pat Boone! I heard of you. - Well, of course you have. - Yeah, my mom has one of your records. - Really? - Yeah, she doesn't play it, but she has it. - I'm beginning to feel like you guys have got records of your own. - I seen you and your daughters on TV. They're pretty cute. - Yeah. - Debby can come over and light up my life anytime. See if she's busy this weekend. I think I can get the car. - You get a car? Hey, short stuff, you're just a kid. Your parents aren't going to give you a car. - You're not listenin', Boonie. I didn't say they'd give me the car. I said I'd get it. Get it? - Got it. - You know, Boone, I like your style. I hate your hair. But I like your style. - Where's the rest of this team anyway? - They'll be out in July. We got an early parole. - Parole? You guys make the Dirty Dozen sound like the Osmonds. - You know what I like about you, Pat? - What? - Nothin'. - I can sure see why your last coach quit. You guys don't need a manager. You need a bail bondsman. What kind of ball players are you anyway? Tell me about last year's season. - You know the expression, "the pits"? - Yeah. - Well, we weren't even that good. - Let me put it to you this way: after the first game, our coach wore a mask so nobody would recognize him. - I'm beginning to get the picture. You weren't exactly all stars, huh? - We once had a game called because the umpire couldn't stop laughing. - Well, guys, that was last year. This year is going to be different. - How come? - Well, for one thing, I don't have a mask. - That's a start. - This year, you guys are going to be winners because you are winners. All you need to do is believe in yourselves, and practice, and hustle. - Right on! - Yeah! Look, last year, nobody had any confidence in you criminal-- uh, you, uh, you kids. But I've got confidence in you. - That's great! - Yeah, I'm proud of you, of you Boone's Bombers. And I want you to be proud of yourselves. Now listen, this year we're going to win, right? What do you say? - All right! - I can't hear you! - All right! - That's better. I'll see you winners tomorrow. - Bye, Pat Boone! - See you tomorrow! - Bye! - Bye! I give him two weeks. - Katherine, how are you? - Oh, just fine, Mrs. Thatcher. - Are you ready for another Little League season? - Eh, I can't think of a better way to spend a Saturday afternoon. - Oh, out in this gorgeous sunshine. And being with good friends. And giving our all to those little darlings. - (SINGING) Little League is friendship, brotherhood, and love. Little League's the stars and stripes a waving up above. It will be a part of us when all the rest are gone. Little League, oh, Little League goes on, and on, and on, and-- - It's a hit. He rounds first base and heading for second. He slides. And he's out. [cheering] - (SINGING) That's my darling sweetie pie who's coming up to bat. - You mean that little Roley Poly? Boy, that kid is fat. My son is going to strike him out. He pitches like a dream. - I've seen that loser pitch before. He's lucky he made the team. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, Little League is friendship, brotherhood, and love. Little League's the stars and stripes a waving up above. It will be a part of us when all the rest are gone. Little League, oh, Little League goes on, and on, and on, and-- - Will the two coaches of the teams come to home plate for a conference? - I wonder what that's all about. - Beats me. - (SINGING) My husband is the tall one. - And the shorter one is mine. The last time he had dinner home was 1969. - Every day is Little League to that devoted jerk. My family wouldn't have food stamps if he'd just go back to work. - That ingrate! - He's rotten. - Who needs it? - I hate it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, Little League is friendship, brotherhood, and love. Little League's the stars and stripes a waving up above. It will be a part of us when all the rest are gone. Little League, oh, Little League goes on, and on, and on, and-- - And that's the final out. The score, Tigers 15, Bears 3. - (SINGING) Hooray, we won. We won the game. - Sure, you had all the breaks. We really should have beaten you. - But you made the mistakes. - If we could cheat like your team does, we'd put you all to shame. - Remember, it's not how you play, as long as you win the game. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Oh, Little League is friendship. It's brotherhood and love. Little League's the stars and stripes a waving up above. It will be a part of us when all the rest are gone. Little League, oh, Little League goes on, and on, and on, and on. Little League is friendship, brotherhood, and love. Little League's the stars and stripes a waving up above. It will be a part of us when all the rest are gone. Little League, oh, Little League goes on, and on, and on. On and on and on. [applause] - Hey, Lindy, are you ready yet? We're going to be late for the party. - Yeah, let's go. - You look absolutely sensational. Is that a new outfit? - Are you kidding? This dress is three years old. Don't you remember, I got it at that big sale? - Well, well, wait a second. What about the shoes? - Do you remember those ratty blue shoes I had? I just cut off the straps and had 'em dyed. - Well wait a second. I know the scarf is new. - The scarf is Mommy's. And this belt belongs to Daddy. I just threw this outfit together. - You know, Lindy? I think maybe you're right. Maybe you should go upstairs and change. - You ought to be in pictures. And I mean it. [doorbell ringing] - Hi, you must be Debby. - Laurey. - No, I'm Ted. Ted Knight. - And I'm Laurey. Laurey Boone. - Oh, oh, oh. A-hem, I'm here to see your father, Pat Boone. We're very, very dear friends. Old, old buddies. - Oh sure. Come on in. - Thank you. - Why don't you make yourself at home and I'll go see where daddy is. - OK. - Boy, he is rich! [whistling] Oh, hi, Debby. - Oh, hi. No, I'm Lindy. - Oh, of course. I'm just waiting to see your dad. We're very close friends. We're old buddies. We had the same milk man and everything. - Well, that's great. Well, why don't you make yourself comfortable. I have to go feed Ryan and Jesse. - Ryan and Jesse? That's two kids I didn't know about. - Ah, Debby. Good girl, helping your mom with the groceries. - That was Cherry. - Oh? Oh, well, then, then you must be-- - Shirley! - --Shirley. - Shirley, I-- Ted Knight! - Hey, Pat-so. - Hey, good to see-- Honey-- - Good to see you. - --do I need to help you with that? - No, that's all right, honey. I'll be back in just a minute. - Heh, ha. Hey, well. - Just killing some time, talking to the little woman. - Yeah, I do that myself sometimes. - You always did have a great sense of humor. - Want to sit down? - Oh, sure. Any place? - Sure, yeah. - I'll take this one. - Yeah. - You have a nice home. - Thank you. Thank you. Well, you know, Ted, I, enjoy you so much on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." You know, the way, the way you play that guy. You really get into it. You say, "Hi, Mar." "Hi, Lou." It's like you-- It's like you really are that guy, you know? - Well, everybody does that. But that's just it, Patrick. I'm... I'm not that character. - No? - We're as different as Knight and Baxter. He's a vain, pompous, arrogant anchor man. But moi? Ted Knight? No, no, no. No, no, no, I'm just a warm, humble guy. Just like you, Pat. Only better clothes. - I really liked you on that show, Ted. - Well, maybe I was a little brilliant. But that was yesterday. Today is today. And tomorrow is tomorrow. And the day after tomorrow... They don't have a name for that. Hey, don't get me wrong guys. I'll be eternally grateful to Mary what's-her-name for, uh, that break. But I'm only concerned with what's happening right now, right this minute. Speaking of time, it's 22 after. - Listen to that. It's the first watch I ever saw that gets residuals. And it's got Ted Knight's face on it. - I look my best at 9 o'clock. Hi, uh, let me guess, uh, you're, uh-- - Debby. - Boy, am I glad to see you. I'm, uh-- - I know. - You do? - Yeah. - Of course you do. - Hey, you know, I really loved you on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." But you know what else? I really think you're even better on "The Love Boat." The way you take charge as the captain, handle all those people and the ship, too? I really think that shows strength and character. - Really? - Uh, Deb, gee. Deb, I'm embarrassed. Honey, this isn't Gavin MacLeod. This is Ted Knight. - The. - Oh, I'm sorry. I really am sorry. It's just sometimes I have this terrible problem remembering names. - Well, some people do have that problem. Excuse me. Pat? - Yeah? - I'm ready. - Ready? For, uh, for what? - Well you know. The egg rolling contest. You said you had one every Easter. That's why I'm here. I even brought my own spoon. It belonged to my mommy. - Boy, that's cute, Ted. Uh, we are-- We are going to have an egg rolling contest. But it's next week. - Oh, oh, gee. Oh, Oh, that's, that's all right. That's all right. A-hem, I have to be in Tarzana in a couple of hours anyway. You see, we're having a Ted Knight lookalike contest. - Oh, are you one of the judges? - No, I'm a contestant. I figure, I look as much like me as any one of those other guys. And I haven't won anything lately. Bye, Shirl-o, Pat-so, Deb-so. - Bye, guy. - Hey, don't do that. Let me do it. Good-bye, guys. I blew it again. - Just a little low fat. Well, look who's here! Kiddie Kong! No, it's not. It's Peter Cottontail, isn't it? In your case, I think it's Peter Polyester Tail. Let's take a little stroll. (SINGING) In your Easter bonnet with all the frills upon it. If you're going to wear an Easter suit, that's the one to wear. I remember my first Easter suit. It was all wool. Wool shirt, coat, pants, tie. I'll never forget. After two hours, I thought I was going to die of terminal itch. What do you have? What are these? - Eggs. - Eggs. Easter eggs, yeah. You know why we have Easter eggs? Because they're the symbol of the rebirth of life and hope. Eh, you'll find out about that later on. And about smoked ham and jelly beans and rabbits. Oh, speaking of Boonies and bunnies. You and I have something in common. Look, Ryan. That's a-- That's a rabbit's foot. It's supposed to give you good luck. - Didn't seem to work too well for that rabbit though, did it? - Nah, they tell me he was hoppin' mad. You don't need the rabbit's foot do you, Ryan? No, with your parents, you were born lucky. - You just make sure you listen to them, honey, and mind your P's and Q's... and carrots. - (SINGING) Here's a piece of good advice. - Look at me when I'm talking to ya, boy. - (SINGING) Think it over once or twice. [MUSIC - PAT AND SHIRLEY BOONE, "BE KIND TO YOUR PARENTS"] - Be kind to your parents, though they don't deserve it. Remember they're grown ups, a difficult stage of life. - They're apt to be nervous and over excited. - Confused from their daily storm and strife. - So confused. Just keep in mind, - (BOTH) though it sounds odd, I know, most parents once were children long ago. Incredible! So treat them with patience and sweet understanding. - In spite of the foolish things they do. - Foolish things they do. - (BOTH) Some day you may wake up and find you're a parent, too. - Well, you have to take your hat off. Hey, look. What's this? - Eggs. [chicken clucking] - Hello, sun. Hello, sky. Hello, world. - Hello, smog. Hello, soot. Goodbye, world. - Hey, you've got to come out of your shell sometime. - What are you so happy about? I think you've been floating around in the cholesterol too long. - Bu-but, but, but, but what are you worried about? Life is wonderful. - Oh, yeah, sure. That's what they told my Uncle Mort. Now he's an Egg McMuffin. - Bu-but, but, Chicken, we're, we're safe here. We're young and, and alive, full of vim and vigor. These are our salad days. - Yeah. Chicken salad. - Think of all the wonderful friends we'll make. - Friends? Friends? Who? - What about the duckies and the geesies? - "The duckies and the geesies." Will you listen to me, chicken lips? This ain't no Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, you know. This is a war zone. And if we don't get out of here, it's all over, but the basting. - Oh, Chicken Little, I, I think you're overreacting. We're only three minutes old. - Come here, kid. Let me tell you something. A three-minute chicken is just a three-minute egg with feet. No matter how you look at it, we're still in hot water. - Aw, don't be such a pessimist. - Look, all I know is you stay around here, you'll end up at the wrong end of a wish. I'm taking a hike. - Where will you go? - Where else? The bird sanctuary. - The bird sanctu-- What's that? - What-- It's a place where people are allowed to feed the birds. But not to other people. More important, it's safe from him. - Him? Who, who him? - The Colonel, the Colonel! He's our worst enemy. A real Attila the Hen. I made a little yolk there. Is it two for the road or are you going to chicken out? - Well, OK, I'll go. - Good. Well, let's hurry. We've got to make a run for it. - Run for it? But, but, why can't we fly? - Listen, pal, if chickens could fly, the Colonel would be out of business. - [chicken clucking] But, but-but, but, but-but, but-but-- - Will you stop it with the but, but, but, but, but? We've got enough egg on our face already. Get going. - Those sure are a couple of dumb clucks. - Hey, Lindy. What's with all the hats? - I found them over by the prop department. You know, the prop guy said I could have him for that neighborhood Easter Parade we're having. - Oh, yeah. - Look at this. Ta-da! - You look like you're standing under the awning of a cheap hotel. - You're right. It should have its own door man. - Laurey, but this is you. - Oh, do you think? - Yes. - Should I? All right. Oh yes. Da-da, da, da, da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da. - Hi guys. - Hi. - Hey, uh, could I, could I get a picture? - Sure. - Oh, great. - Yeah. - Good idea. - Well, this is my best side. - - (BOTH SINGING) Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so. - You know Easter is lots of things to lots of people. The fashions, the parades. But above all, it's giving thanks for our blessings and sharing in the hopes and prayers that as each flower is reborn into full bloom, so will the Earth blossom with peace and joy for all of us. - Hey, we sure have had a wonderful time with you tonight. And from our family to your family, we wish you a beautiful Passover and a Happy Easter. [music playing] - For Pat Boone and Family, this is Dick Tufeld speaking.
