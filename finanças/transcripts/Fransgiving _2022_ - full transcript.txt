Higher power that be for some. Today, we celebrate -- -Dank food. -Excuse me. Let me fucking finish. -Mel, I think I would actually like to say grace tonight. -You wouldn't know Grace if she fucked you in the ass. -[ Scoffs ] Rude. -Oh, my heck. -I'm sorry. Do you have a problem with my language? -That move is sick, bro. -Okay, I know I just had the most cathartic freakout of my life, but I'm not far from a second. -Mm, nobody wants that from you. -And what do we want from you? The girl that can't go three months without getting high. -I'm sorry, when was the last timeyouwent three months without getting high? -Why are you even here? -Okay, Iwasgoing to apologize for bullying you two in high school, but now lookwho's the fucking bully. -She has a point. -Oh, says the born-again who can't handle a slightest inconvenience. -[ Scoffs ] Damn. -Wait. Let me smell your mouth. -No. No. Fuck off. Stop!-Let me smell your mouth. -Knew it! You red-wine-stained- teeth-having-ass bitch. -Leave her alone, Frances. -Seriously? -I'm so annoyed at him saying that. -Can I just not fucking speak around you? -Literally everything you say is fucking annoying. Just because your beats are fire doesn't mean that any of us want to hear the stupid shit that comes out of your mouth. -Babe, I think we shouldget the fuck out of here. -Huh? -I think it's time we go home. -Go where? You can't drive. -Can you not drive? -Absolutely not. -You know, we don't have to take this. You know we don't have to take this. -Oh, no, no, I-I want to see all of this. -Babe, I think we should just go home. We just go home. -No, we're not leaving. You brought me here to see who you are in this other relationship. [ Laughs ] I still don't get it. Like, just tell me the truth. Why are we here? Did you -- Did you bring me here to... fuck her? -All right -- -You want to know the truth? -Please. Please. Please. -The truth is, I convinced Atticus to open up your guys' relationship because I thought, "Let's see how cool your girlfriend really is." And you know what? You're not that cool. -Oh. You know, it's kind of pathetic how you hang on to him still. He just uses you. -Oh, really? Who uses who? -It's "whom." It's "whom." [ Sobs ] [Crying] "Whom." -[ Laughing ] -Atticus? Atticus. -Hey. Atticus. -No, what did you do? What did you do, Mel? -Okay, relax. I just dropped a Xeroofex in his drink. It's the doggie Xanax, you guys. -Melissa! -Don't even fucking full-name me. -You could have killed him. -He's fine. Just a little sleepy. -Oh, my God. -Uh, you're welcome. He was being fucking annoying, and he stole my catchphrase. -Yo, I drug JD all the time. It's chill. -See? -JD, are you drinking? -Yeah. I'm having a glass. -Since when do you drink? -Since tonight. -But I stopped drinking for you. -Okay, I never asked you to do that. -Hannah, are you okay? -Uh... Can I ask you a question? Why are you here? -Oh, okay.I mean, can I be honest? -Can you? -I thought... [Clears throat] that if I came here, I could prove to Atticusthat I can be open-minded to accept thisotherpart of his life that he's kept compartmentalized from me for so long. [ Laughs ] I -- [Clears throat] I wanted to believe that your relationship with him was purely physical. I thought you were gonna be a lot hotter, and you're not that hot. [ Laughs ] Like, you're -- you're, like, naturally pretty. Which is much worse. -Thank you. I think. -I guess... I guess I just thought that if I came here, he would realize hewantsto be with me. [ Laughs ] To become more mature. He says he doesn't want to get married until he's 30. Well, I'm almost 30 and I can't wait around while my clock ticks until he changes his mind. But -- But he's willing, for some reason, to go into buying property together, which is like a 20-year commitment, you know? And now I'm here, and I feel so dumb. -Oh, I'm such a dick. -Thank you for saying that. -[ Shouts indistinctly ] -Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Relax! -What are you doing? Stop! -I mean... I get it. I get it. I'm over here making these sacrifices for a guy who literally needs to get punched in the face to get his attention. Like, are you kidding me? -Oh, my God, you guys. I almost forgot to apologize for doing heroin at your high-school graduation. Oh, my God. That's the whole point of me being here was to do my, like, living amends or whatever. Okay, so I'm really sorry, and I promise not to be like that anymore. Like, maybe. -Thanks, Mel. Looks to me like we're gonna order Postmates, right? -Um, fuck yeah. -But my turkey's fucking good. -I'll Venmo you. -This one's on Daddy number two. -And I guess... cheers to our biological clocks and delusional grandeurs. -Wait! Did someone say cocaine? -Aah! Where?! -Fuck yeah! -I don't know. I thought someone here had to have it. -Uh...
