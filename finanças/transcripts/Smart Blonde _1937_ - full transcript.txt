- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Driver, let me off in the next crossing, will you? - Okay, lady. - Here, here, I'll pay you now. Uh... are we on time, conductor? Right on the nose, miss. I wonder if you could tell me... I'm looking for Mr. Torgensen. Next car forward, drawing room A. Thank you. Sit down, Miss Lane. Mr. Torgenson, my paper wants to know why Fitz Mularkey sold out to you. Why, there's nothing to it. Fitz wanted to sell, we're old buddies. And I know a good buy when I see it, so I'm taking over. Do you know that several men in this town overbid you? I didn't make a bid. Fitz came up to Boston, told me he was tired of the racket. And that he was going to get hooked to a good gal who didn't like the game. Didn't like him mixed up in it. He offered to let me dig in for a million flat. Half down, the balance in five years. - Anything wrong with that? - No... nothing wrong with that. - Are you taking over everything? - The whole works. The racetrack, the fight arena and the Million Club. And I'm gonna run them like Fitz ran them, on the level. Do you happen to know why he passed up... ...that two hundred grand of his offer over to your price? Fitz could have sold to half a dozen guys for more than I'm giving him. He wanted to leave his babies in good hands. He wants to live like what he calls a human being. That's his business. Me, well... I like it like I am, a little rough, a little tough, a little nasty. But on the level. You know, I think you're pretty regular, Mr. Torgensen. No, I'm just a plain guy trying to earn a living. Yessir, Mr. Torgensen. Well, here we are. Come on, I'll drive you to your paper. Oh, that's swell. I'm late for dinner late as it is. But Chuck, why don't you go home? Aw, leave me alone. Won't you please let me put you in the cab? Don't bother me, there's a guy I've gotta see. - God bless you. - Come on, Chuck. Stop pulling me, Dolly, I know what I'm doing. All right, all right, come on, you've gotta go home. I don't wanna go home, I've got something to do. Yes, I know, I know. Mr. Torgensen! - Mr. Torgensen! - Who shot him? Some shots came through the window, look! - See those holes? - Yeah, better call an officer. Hey, officer! Officer! Alright, come on, stand aside there, stand aside! - What's the matter here, what's happened? - Some shots! See? Right through that window. City desk! Maxie, Torchy Blane. Now get this, George Torgensen, millionaire promoter, ...was just murdered in front of the Union Station. Good work, Torchy, hang on. I'll give you a rewrite. Hey, Richards, get on number 12. Okay, shoot. Here's your lead, Bert. "George 'Tiny' Torgensen, millionaire sports promoter, stepped into an assassin's bullet as he entered a taxi cab this evening... in front of the Union Station, on his way to take over the numerous enterprises... ...of his lifelong friend, Fitz Mularkey, popular nightclub owner and impresario of the sporting world. - Hello, Dolly, just get in? - Yes. - Got time for a drink? - Hm-hm, thanks. Good. Two specials. - So this is the night, huh, Fitz? - This is it. Gee, you look nice tonight, Dolly. Don't it make you kind of sad leaving all this? Not a bit. I'm fed up, lady. I want a home and a business that I can be proud of. I'm sorry, Dolly. I mean, about us. If it weren't that I was pulling out, I... - Oh, forget it. Hey, how about Chuck? You know, he's been your man Friday for years. I'm fixing it so he'll have an income for life. I had to cut away from Chuck, Dolly. I couldn't break him of that habit of carrying a gun. The business I'm going in now I wouldn't want that. - He's pretty sore. - Oh, he's not sore at me. He's sore because he thinks I'm giving up a good thing. He doesn't understand. Ladies and gentlemen, Introducing our popular siren of song, Miss Dolly Ireland. Well, it looks like Ireland's on. I won't say goodbye. That's right, it's your last night too, isn't it? Want me to sing my last song for you? Yeah, will you? # Why do I have to sing a torch song # # When there is a love song in my heart # # Why must I sigh if love passed my by # # Why do they look for a tear in my eye # # How can I sing a song # # That tells you I'm blue # # I've got the man I love # # And he loves me too # # I'd rather play another part # # And open up my heart # Chuck's here. He's pretty drunk and looking for trouble. Eddie and Boze have got him in your office... ...but he says he won't leave without seeing you. - Okay, I'll see him. - But take it easy, Fitz. - Remember he packs a rod. - He's all right. # He's everything to me # # Couldn't be more # # He's mine to adore # Why don't you smarten up, Chuck? Get hip to yourself. What's the matter with you? You know what's the matter. Turn against your old buddies. That's what you're doing. Trying to go highbrow. Chuck, you'd better get out of here. Go home and sober up and I'll see you in the morning. This can't wait for morning. Get these guys out. I want to tell you something. - I said tomorrow. - Alright! I'll tell you now. You're nuts, Fitz! If you think you can sell out and marry that Friel dame... Get his gun. Poor lunkhead. Hate to have to do that to you. - Put that in the desk, will you, Carney? - Right. Eddie, you and Boze see that he gets home all right. Take him out the back way. # I simply got to let my happiness out # # To tell you about my love # # He's everything to me # # Couldn't be more # # He's mine to adore # # So... # # Why do I have to sing a torch song # # When a song of love # # Is ringing in my heart # - Hello, Adolph. - Good evening, Lieutenant. - Hello, Dixie. - Hello, Miss Blane. May I take your hat, Mr. McBride? - Thank you, Dixie. - You don't need a check. Hello, Steve, you haven't been around lately. - How are you, Fitz? - How are you, Torchy? - Fine, thank you. - Can I see you alone for a minute? - Why, sure, come into the office. - You wait here. I said you wait here. Big stiff! - Aint he masterful? - Yeah, all he needs is a leopard skin. Oh, say, Miss Blane, did you miss the excitement, did you miss the excitement? - What happened? - You know Chuck Cannon? - Yes. - Well, he was in here just a few minutes ago, stewed to the eyeballs and I swear I thought he was gonna bust. - Tell me more. - Well, it's none of my business. I was standing here, I wasn't expecting a thing. And in he came. And was he... Well, you can imagine. How many guys tried to buy you out when you announced you were going out of business? Oh, I don't know, four or five. Kind of made some hard feelings, didn't it? I mean, your going out of town for your buyer. No, no hard feelings. Who were the for or five? Well, let's see. There was Guy Shaster and Willy Pope, they came in together. Then there was Brad Hooper... and Pickney Sax, that's all, four. - And no hard feelings, eh? - No. What makes you ask that? - Torgensen. - What about him? Torgensen was killed tonight. About a quarter past eight. - Where? - Coming out of Union Station. Hm, then there were some hard feeling, huh? Fitz, I want you to listen to me. You've kept your hands clean ever since you've been in this town. How in the business you're in I don't know, but you have. Now you're all set to bail out clean. You're going into what we call legitimate business and I'm for you. Thanks, Steve, thanks. I know that you and Torgensen were old buddies. I was glad when I heard you were selling out to him. Now some mugs knocked him off. I know how you feel about that, Fitz. But the minute you go for anybody with a gun, even if they did kill Torgensen, it's still murder. Poor little Tiny. Didn't even carry a gun. He used to say it was guns and bodyguards that got guys killed. You heard what I said, didn't you, Fitz? Yeah, sure, Steve, sure. But there's only one thing's gonna stop me. I'm gonna marry Marcia Friel. I think Tiny'd understand that. And I'm too crazy about Marcia to ball things up by killing anybody. - Orchids to Miss Friel. - Yes... It's an idea. You know, you're all right, Dixie. You ought to make a good newspaperman. Well, I might not make a good newspaperman but I might make a good newspaperwoman. I just love to snoop. - Can we eat now? - No. - Did you okay these checks, boss? - Yeah. If you see Tom, tell him I put Chuck's gun in the safe. Yes, sir. - Hey, Mac! - Hey, skipper, any clues? I can't talk now, boys. You're not holding out on us, are you, McBride? - What's this Mularkey have to say? - Does Fitz know who killed him? Well, how about a statement on crime suppression? Boys, Sherlock's in a trance, he'll slip you the whole story in a minute. I guess you must have those birds hypnotized. Well, you're one up on me, you got them goofy. What'll I tell them? Tell them I think all reporters are a headache and I don't know why I even talk to them. I don't either, you never tell us anything. Maybe you know who bumped off Torgensen. Not offhand, but with a little time and something to eat I might be able to help you. Aw, why don't you go home? There's nothing in the icebox. Besides, I like your company. Nothing like a man of action. Let me tell you... - Yes, sir? - Send Blyfuss in here! Looking for me? Leon, what do you know about Pickney Sax, Guy Shaster, - Will Pope and Brad Hooper? - More than I know about my inlaws. Okay, Leon, I don't want Sax, Shaster, Pope or Hooper. I want their inside men, all of them. - Any charge? - No, I'll book them for investigation. There's a fly right there on that... Anything else, Lieutenant? - Did you get it? - No... No! Four guys, Torchy. Four guys who wanted to buy Fitz out. He turned them down. Gee, this is terrible. Fitz turns to his pal Tiny Torgensen. Torgensen's killed coming out of Union Station. One of those four guys got him before he could close the deal. Fitz is about to get out. He wants to sell. - He will sell. - Tunics are going out. - Huh? - Tunics are going out. What the Sam Hill are you talking about? Tunics, they're going out of style and I've got two of them. Who got away with my... Hello! Tell somebody to bring back my garboon and a mop! No, not a cop, a mop! - You know what I'm doing? - Sure, starting a fire. I'm rounding up the pulse men of Sax, Shaster, Pope and Hooper. I suppose you thought I'd round up the headmen themselves, eh? Well, that's all right, Stevie. Rounding up all those guys is a good display of psychology. Keeps your cops busy and there's something for the boys out there to put in the paper. But I don't think it's gonna get you anything. Why not? Because you can't charge these guys with anything, you can only hold them overnight, you'll bring in about twenty of them altogether, you'll have to do some shellacking. So, if you work on each one three hours, that's sixty hours and you can't hold them that long. - That's just paper figuring. - Yes? Well here's some more paper figuring. You've got four bidders, two of them teamed, which makes three bidding, each one with enough dough to buy Fitz out, see? - So what? - Why would one bidder knock off Torgensen... ...and take a chance of Fitz selling out to one of the others? Ah, these guys aren't hop-ins, they're businessmen. Men who have to get something definite before they pull it. - Go on, do some more paper figuring. - Ah! You're just one of these destructive critics. You say everything a guy does is rotten but you don't build up anything yourself. All right, sweetheart, did you ever hear of Chuck Cannon? Fitz's bodyguard? Sure, what about him? Chuck's been slamming around all week, stewed to the ears. He doesn't want Fitz to quit business because that means the end of his job. Maybe he figured that with Torgensen out of the way, Fitz woudn't think of selling out to one of these crooked bigshots in town. Well, if he feels that way about it, why doesn't he go to work on Marcia Friel? She's the one Fitz is bailing out for. Maybe he's like this. He thinks a woman's a wonderful thing. No, he couldn't be that dumb. You... Gahagan! You sure pick a swell time to wash it. Well, you told me to wash it. How did I know I was gonna be busy? Well, how did I? Well, I'll use my own car. Works better with the switch on. Look out! Maybe we should have waited till Gahagan washed the other car. Yeah, this car's been stearing kind of funny lately. It might be a good idea so long as you're gonna drive all over the street... ...to put your lights on. Thank you. Hey, Al, did Eddie and Boze get back yet? I haven't seen them, Mr. Carney. Well, a round trip, eh, Lieutenant? - Is Chuck around? - No. Fitz? Where is he? - I think he went home. - Is Chuck still bunking with him? No, he got temperamental and moved out. I don't know where to. - Thanks, Tom. - Have a drink? No, thanks. - Move over. - Uh-uh! I'm going to find out what's wrong with the stearing gear. 314, Weston Drive! Nobody home, now's our chance to eat. - Well, hello, Steve. - Hello, Fitz. - Hello, Torchy. - Hello. - Come in, come in. - Thanks. Miss Friel and her brother just stopped in, I'd like you to meet them. - Marcia, this is Lt. Steve McBride. - How do you do? - Miss Friel. - And this is Torchy Blane, the best newspaper gal in town. - Thanks. - I'm so glad to know you. - I've heard about you. - We've heard about you too. And Miss Friel's brother Lewis. - How are you? - I'm very glad to know you. We're going in the real estate game together. - Oh, you're Fitz's new partner, eh? - That's right. Of course, after what's happened, naturally things will be held up awhile. I asked them to stop in, Steve. It sort of shook me thinking about Tiny. You see, Fitz and Mr. Torgensen were very old friend. Can I see you alone for a minute, Fitz? Why yes, sure, um... Excuse us, will you? - Right here, Steve. - Won't you sit down? Oh yes, thanks. Hey, this is all right. Quite a library, Fitz. - You like it? - Yeah. I hired a college guy to pick these books out. Don't read much myself. Sonnets from the Portuguese. Well, I guess I couldn't read that if I wanted to. Say... is Chuck around? Chuck said this place was getting a little highbrow, he, er... You know how it is, he shifted to other quarters. - Quite a guy, Chuck. - Yeah, quite a guy, Steve. Where did you say he moved to, Fitz? - Why, you want to see him? - Yeah, I'd like to. - Well, I'll get him right over. - No, no, don't do that. Just the address. 65, Lion Street. It's a rooming house, room 15. Thanks. What's on your mind? Oh, nothing, just checking up. It's been so nice to talk to you. - Do lunch with me soon. - Thanks, I'd love to. And don't worry about Fitz, he's... - Well, take it easy, fellow. - Fitz, you're not... Oh, it's all right, Marcia, Steve and me always have our little secrets. It's been a pleasure to meet you, Miss Friel. I think you're gonna be good for Fitz. Thank you. Well, good night, all. Come along, skipper. - Good night. - Good night. Good night, Lieutenant. - Good night. - Good night, Fitz. - Did you see that look on Fitz's face? - Yeah, I saw it. Torchy, she's the only thing that stands between Fitz and murder. If Chuck ever gets crocked and decides to clout that gal with lead... - That means the end of Fitz. - Right. No. - You wait here. - Oh, but I want to go with you! This rathole is no place for a woman. But I'm a newspaperman. Well you just sit quiet and maybe nobody'll notice it. Skipper. Don't do that! Don't ever do that! - Can't I ever lose you? - Uh-uh. Well, looks like Chuck was just marking time, huh? Yeah, all set to blow out of town. I wonder if he... - Well, he hasn't been gone very long. - What makes you think that? There are drops of water all over the outside of that glass when it slopped over it. Oh, the glass probably sweat. That forms in beads. That's water. Maybe you're right. Yeah, strange as it seems, you are right. The end of this cigarette is still damp. Well what's this? Here's the impression of something he wrote. He used a hard pencil and part of it came through, see? What does it say? Well, I can make this much out... "If you go through with it..." No, I can't make out the next. But here, here a little later on... "Fitz don't know what he's doing." And it fades again. Look... look, listen to this. "Try and muscle in and I'll..." Hm, it fades again. And farther down... Farther down I see this. "Even if he calls you his best friend," - Take it along, it might help. - "Might" help? Well, you can't hang a guy on that. No, but I can hang plenty on him with it. - Well, maybe. - What do you mean "maybe"? You drive me batty. You get all steamed up about something then you throw cold water on it. Come on! - We're gonna eat? - No, we ain't gonna eat. I gotta call headquarters and get a man stake out here to watch this place. Shh! Listen. I thought I'd come over and see what this stuff is about Chuck. Why, it's nothing, Fitz, I'm just checking up. Skip it. - You don't have to kid me. - I'm not trying to kid you, Fitz. Why don't you go home and get some sleep, you're taking this thing too hard. I'll go home and sleep when I want to! You're not checking up, you've got something on Chuck. - You're getting tough, Fitz. - I'm getting sore! Really, that's all he's doing, just checking up... - Mind your own business. - That's no way to talk, Fitz! - I want to know what you got on Chuck! - I haven't got anything on him. I can tell when you got your nose close to the ground! You've got something on Chuck and if you say you haven't you're a liar. I tell you I haven't got anything on him. There's a man that's slowly turning to dynamite. Yeah, and if anybody else but him had talked to me like that, I'd kick their teeth out. Come on, kid, let's call it a day. Aw gee, skipper, you're the tops. - Good morning, Lieutenant. - Good morning. - Any news form the Lion Street place? - Nope. That is... who's this, er... - What's his name, you know... - Chuck. Yes, him, he ain't showed up. - Cole's staked up there now. - What else? Well, Blyfuss and his firing squad rounded up a lot of potatoes last night. Twenty-three guys in the holdover. Oh, yeah, Pickney Sax came in about ten minutes ago. - He gave me this magazine. - Where is he? Somewheres, I don't know. Say, Lieutenant, what's a locus like in this story? - That's police slang for nightstick. - Oh! Hello, Sax, you mind if I come in? No, come on in. - So you read too, eh? - Sure. Want one? I always carry three or four with me. When I get sick of reading the, I cut paper dolls. You didn't want to see me by any chance, did you? Yeah. Five of my boys was picked up last night by a gang of your stooges. And the boys want to see a football game today. - That's very interesting. - What are you holding them for? A fellow was killed last night. Sure, a fellow was killed last night. A fellow from Boston. A little big fella. "Tiny" Torgensen. - I did it, so what? - You look awful worried. Sure I'm worried, look at me. Look at me puss hang down to me toes with worry. You and your crummy ideas. All right, beat it, they'll be out at noon. They'll get out now, now! Why, you... Go on, beat it. Why did I kill Torgensen... when only one bigshot in this burg could outbid me on Mularkey's deal? Mularkey knows who knocked off Torgensen. - So does Dolly Ireland. - What about Dolly Ireland? What about Dolly Ireland? I know a guy, McBride, a blind guy, only he ain't blind. He seen Dolly Ireland and Chuck Cannon going past the Union Station... ...a few minutes before Torgensen was shot. - Figure it out, you're smart. - You figure it out for me. Sure, Chuck becomes a sore bird when Fitz quits the old racket. Dolly Ireland is crazy about Fitz, but he's going high-hat with a swell dame. I'm making no charges, I ain't saying a thing. But just figure that one out. - Good morning, skipper. - Yeah. - How about some breakfast? - Had my breakfast. - Lunch? - Never eat lunch. I'll settle for dinner. - Oh, all right. - Where do we go from here? I'm going to see Fitz Mularkey's hat check girl. Oh, Dixie! - Come on, Gahagan. - What a day! Just the kind of a day I like. I like this time of year too. - I like... - Come on, get going. - Take my wife now... - You got her, you keep her, and shut up. - Where to? - Down Raymond Avenue. - There's a lot of traffic. - Down Raymond Avenue! Okay! - Yoohoo, Dixie! - Come in. Oh, hello. Oh, gee, Mr. McBride, I don't know a thing about anything. What have I done? Oh, it's all right, Dixie, I just want to ask you a few questions. - I never saw him before in my whole life. - Saw who? - Him. - He certainly is a lot of dog. - Where did you get him? - That's it, I don't know. I woke up this morning and there he was, as big as won't get out. Animals must like me. - Is that a dog? - Yes indeedy. - It all started at a birthday party. - Yeah, but what I wanted to know is... I'll tell you right from the start. There were thirteen people at the table... ...not counting him. - Maybe... - I don't want to rush you, Dixie, but... What do you know about Dolly Ireland? Who, Do...? Oh, Dolly! Well, Dolly's one of these girls... well, you know, she walks right up to you, and sticks out her hand and says... "Hi, kid." I always thought she was pretty regular. Though I did see her get mad and crown a guy once with a bottle. She was awful mad. Well, were she and Fitz ever that way about each other? You mean like you and her? Answer the question! Well, I did see them together a lot, but it always looked like a brother and sister act to me. I wish I knew where I got that dog. - Do you know where Dolly lives? - Over on Sycamore Avenue. 598. - Sycamore Avenue. - Okay, thanks. That's some pooch, Dixie. You know, they carry brandy around in the Alps. In the Alps? You must have been higher than you thought last night. Yeah... Huh?! Well, come on, tag along, I suppose you're in on this to. Not this time, skipper, I'll have to trust you with Dolly alone. - I have a luncheon date. - I pity the guys that pays the check. - Who is he? - Oh, he's tall, dark and handsome. - Well, who is he? - See you at dinner, skipper. What a day, what a day! I feel like a million bucks. I could write a poem, I could. A poem I could write, a poem... Oh, shut up! 598, Sycamore Avenue, Dolly Ireland's. Lieutenant, what is it that rhymes with Ireland? That's what I'm trying to find out, come on! "Hypnotized by the green in her eyes... - Good morning, Miss Ireland. - Hello, Lieutenant. - May I talk to you for a moment? - Sure, come in. Thank you. - I'm just having breakfast. - Well, I don't like to interrupt. Oh, that's all right. Have some coffee? Thanks, I will. - Sit down. - Thank you. Murder is a pretty serious thing, isn't it, Miss Ireland? You ought to know, Lieutenant, you handle enough of it. How did you happen to be around Union Station last night with Chuck Cannon? Boy, you get around, don't you? I hear things. Sugar and cream? No. Black. Well? There's a dress shop in the station run by a friend of mine. I stopped in and bought a dress. - Want to see it? - No, no. What did you do then? After I left the shop I ran into Chuck. He was pretty drunk. I took him by the arm and walked him past the station, shoved him in a cab and took one myself and went on to the Million Club. You know, Miss Ireland, sometimes I have to ask personal questions. Were you ever in love with Fitz Mularkey? Well, maybe I did love him. But he never could see me. It was just as well. Now he's getting what he's always wanted. - And I'm mighty glad. - You don't look very sore about it. Why should I be sore when a grand guy like Fitz makes the grade. By the way, Miss Ireland, do you happen to know where Chuck is now? No. The last I saw of Chuck was when I put him in that cab. Why? There's a chance that Chuck killed Tiny Torgensen. - Don't let Fitz find that out. - I know. That's why I want to find Chuck. I think Fitz suspects. - If Fitz ever thought that Chuck... - Exactly. I may have to talk to you about this again, Miss Ireland. - Thanks for the coffee. - Don't mention it. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hot diggity! - What are you doing now? Boy, oh boy, do I feel good. I feel like I could smack somebody right in the jaw. I hope you don't mean a bigger guy with the same idea. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, come on, back to the Bastille. - Thank you. - I was hoping that Lewis could join us... ...but he's been detained at the office. I'm very proud of that brother of mine, I wish you could know him better. He's a very good-looking boy. You two make a striking couple. You know, no one would take you for brother and sister. I guess we don't look very much alike. Lewis resembles Father more closely while I look more like Mother. She must be a very beautiful woman. Is she coming to your wedding? I'm afraid not, my parents are both in California. Oh, by the way, before I forget it. I want to run a story of you and Fitz. Do you happen to have a photogragh I might use? Only that one and I've promised it to Fitz. - Well, naturally he comes first. - He does. - May I have another one? - Why, certainly. Thanks. - Going down, mister? - Yes... yes, sure. - Mr. McBride. - Yes, Miss Friel. - How are you? - How do you do? Oh, sit down. Sit down, Mr. Friel. - What can I do for you? - It's about Fitz. I saw Fitz this morning. He wouldn't admit it, but I think he's been out all night. Can't you do something? Can't you go and talk to him? I have talked to him. But can't you advise him to sell his business now... ...to anyone who wants to buy it? You know how particular Fitz is about a buyer. I'm afraid after what he told me this morning. - What did he tell you? - Well... it was about Chuck. - Marcia, I wouldn't go into that. - I don't care, we have to protect Fitz. Chuck was in the Million Club last night, drunk. - Yeah, I know. - Fitz took a gun away from him. Two shots had been fired from it. There had, eh? Well, I don't think you have to worry anymore about Fitz doing anything foolish. I've got a hunch that Chuck is a long ways from here by now. - You think he's left town? - Yeah, sure. Oh, I'm glad. Oh, excuse me. Hello? Yeah, this is McBride. What? Shane Hotel? I'll be right over. They just found Chuck Cannon murdered. Oh! Hello? Just a minute please. - Where's the trouble? - Room 410. - Thanks. - Hello? Everything's alright here. They make me come downstairs and after I get down here they don't let me go up again. - It's really important, officer... - No, no I said. Well you don't seem to understand. - I'm from the Herald, I'm Torchy Blane. - I don't care if you're flaming youth. - You can't go in there. - You still don't... - Hello, Lieutenant. - Hi, skipper... Oh, hello. - Hi, Clyde. - Hi. That's Chuck Cannon alright. Yeah. He was registered here under the name of J. J. Martin. What time did it happen? Well, around about a quarter to three a guy in the room below heard a racket up here. He phoned the desk and asked him to have it stopped on account he had a headache. About five minutes later they sent a guy up here and he found this. Looks like it was quite a scrap. Yeah, and there was blood in the bathroom where somebody washed. What was he slugged with? It's pretty definite that he was crowned with that pinch bottle over there. I found it in the bathtub. The guy washed it when he washed his hands, you won't find any fingerprints on it. Did you find anything else? Yeah, the clerk said about half past one... ...Chuck came down to the desk and asked for an envelope. They were safekeeping it for him. Here's the envelope, but there's nothing in it. Whatever was in it was snatched. There might be some prints on it. You just tell him what you saw and I'll put your name in the paper. What is your name? Harry, but I don't want to get mixed up in no murder. All right, Harry, you come with me. - Excuse us please, officer... - You still can't go in! Oh, yes I can. Skipper! - You can't do that! - Skipper, let me in! - What the... - Here's a hot clue for you, Sherlock. - What is all this? - Go ahead, kid, spill it. Well, about the time this happened I took a guy down the elevator from this floor. The guy's hat was dented and he was drying his hands on a handkerchief. What did he look like? Well, he was a tall fellow with kinda flat cheeks and dark hair and... Well, that all I know, mister. - That sounds like Fitz. - Hm-hmm. You stick around the hotel, will you, kid? Yes, sir. What else, Marsotti? I found this gun over by the bureau. It's got Chuck's initial on the handle. No fingerprints there either. The way it looks, fingerprints have been rubbed off everything Take this gun over to ballistics and have Haymes check on it, it's important. - Right. - Got another clue, skipper? I'll tell you later. You don't need me here any longer. Well, come on. Do you mind if I stick around and just snoop a little bit, skipper? No, go right ahead. Pick up your fun where you find it. What's the matter, Luke? Oh, you burn me up, you drive like a fool. - Excuse me, miss. - Oh... nice view, isn't it? Not for my money. Is this a friend of yours? - No. - So you can't take it, huh? No! Quit squawking, I'll be careful going back. Well, come on, sister, this room's rented. I just want to powder my nose. Well, are you coming? Sure. Oh, hello, Mr. McBride, you're here early. Yeah, you find out where you got that dog yet? - Yeah, I traded a sheepdog for him. - Where did you get the sheepdog? Gosh, I never thought of that. - Is Carney in yet? - Yeah, he's in, he got in early. - He's in his office. - Thanks. Come in. Well, hello, Lieutenant. I hear Fitz took a gun away from Chuck Cannon last night. Now don't try to pull any fast ones. Well, er... sure. Yeah, yeah, we took a gun away from him. He didn't have it out, we just took it and then sent him on his way. What did you do with it? - Fitz put it in the safe. - Get it. Sure. It's not here. Who else knows the combination? Only Fitz. Thanks. I want you to come with me, Fitz. Okay. - Why did you do it? - He killed Tiny. - You promised me... - I know, I know! Then he threatened Marcia. Told me he'd kill her. Why didn't you phone me and let me take him? I don't know, I don't know. It's gonna be tough, Fitz. You won't be able to plead self-defense. I know that Chuck's gun was taken away from him last night and put in your safe. You took it out. You carried the load to the hotel and left it in Chuck's room. Well, I didn't get away with it, you just can't blame me for trying. - What did you take out of the envelope? - What envelope? There was a big thick envelope that Chuck got from the hotel clerk... ...before you got there. The envelope was empty when we found it. I don't know anything about that. I know you're trying to give me a break, Steve, Thanks. When Chuck got Tiny, I left that to you. When he threatened to kill Marcia, I... This means the chair, Fitz. Premeditated murder. That means weeks and months of trial and after that more weeks in the death house. Sorry to do that to you, Fitz. Here, let me help you. Stick 'em up. Back around there. - Oh, you're gonna be funny, eh? - Stay there or I'll drop you. When I'm out this door, you can call your cops. They'll give you a quick answer. But I ain't going to no jail! Here's the blow-up on that Chuck Cannon murder. Look, Maxie, do me a favor, will you? I gotta go. Call up the Boston Star and have them locate a person by the name of Corson, living in an apartment ending in e-r-m-a-n. What's this, a crossword puzzle? Well, I don't know. I found that in Chuck Cannon's room. What's this got to do with the Cannon killing? Boy! Well, it may have a lot to do with that Torgensen killing. You know, Torgensen came from Boston. Listen, Torchy, are you working for me or for Steve McBride? - Now, I have another assignment here... - Oh, listen, Maxie, give me a break, will you? That big palooka can't even think without me around. I've got a couple of angles on this case... - Why don't you marry that guy? - That's one of the angles. - When did Miss Ireland leave here? - About a half an hour ago. I carried her bag out and called a cab for her. - Bag, eh? - Yep. Went to Union Station. - What did the bag look like? - A black patent leather I guess. Had the letters D I on it. Thanks. Hey, Gahagan, run to Union Station. - Siren and all? - Yeah, siren and all. Oh boy, Oh boy! What was the last train out of here and where was it bound for? Twilight Fly for Boston, just left. When was the one before that? Local for New York, left at 3:50. - May I have that? - Sure. Thanks. Any of you boys remember carrying a black patent leather bag... ...for a lady that had the initials D I on it? No, sir. Yes, I remember seeing a black bag. I put the lady on the Twilight Fly. - Thanks, George. - Thank you, sir. Call up the State police headquarters at Bancroft. Tell them to flag down the Twilight Fly passing now in a few minutes. Tell them to take off Dolly Ireland. She's travelling with a black patent leather suitcase with her initials on it. She's a medium-height good-looking brunette. Ask them to bring her back here in a car to headquarters quick. Come on, Sally, get in the picture. No, I don't want to, just take a picture of Eloise. - Oh, go on. - No, just take a picture of the pup. Come on, stand back, make up your mind. - There! - Did you get her? Uh-huh. - I should have had me medals. - Thank you, mister. - What medals? - Nix, nix. Not bad, eh? - Get in the car. - That pup left me motes. - Can I give you a lift, skipper? - Are you trying to haunt me? - Where to? - Headquarters, Gahagan. - Siren and all? - No, you've had your siren. What were you doing at the station? Oh, I was just seeing a friend off on the train. That tall, dark, handsome man I was telling you about. Aw, I hope he falls off and breaks his neck. Skipper, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Aw, you're aces with me, kid. You know, Torchy, I like you. And I oughta be hung for slamming you around the way I have. Skipper! Yeah, from now on the rough stuff is out as far as you're concerned. I'm gonna treat you right. Oh, skipper. Torchy Blane, you're the worst pest this side of the penitentiary. I told you you were wasting your time rounding up all those heels. Don't kid yourself, baby, on account of that roundup... ...I got into an argument with Pickney Sax and I learned things. All right, you learned things, what? I found out there was somebody else besides Chuck Cannon around at the station... ...when Torgensen was killed, somebody who didn't want Fitz to sell out. - Now don't bother me! - Oh, I oughta let you have it. You leave me alone. Okay, mastermind, that solves the Torgensen killing. Now, what about the Cannon murder, you haven't brought Fitz in yet. No, I haven't! Aren't you going to send out a general alarm? I'm not so sure I want him. I got a hunch Fitz is covering up somebody and I know who it is. Swell, that settles everything then, come on, let's go eat. No! - Send Blyfuss in here! - He isn't here. He ain't? Well, where is he? - Here I am. - Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you! Where's that pad I told you to send to the chemist last night? Here it is. Right here. He... he had a lot of trouble with it. - Some of the impressions were very faint... - Alright, alright, get out! What does it say, skipper? "If you go throught with it, it's curtains. Fitz don't know what he's doing. Clear out and keep quiet. Try and muscle in and I'll spill everything. I know Fitz and he'll kill you even if he calls you his best friend. You'll find me at the Shane Hotel under the name of J. J. Martin." It's signed C. C.. That's just what I wanted, now we're getting somewhere. Well, let me in on it. Why, this is the note that Chuck wrote to Torgensen asking for an appointment. But Chuck got stewed and knocked him off without waiting to talk to him. - Then who killed Chuck? - That's in the bag. You just stick around a couple of minutes and you'll see. Yep, right away! Now keep your little eyes open and watch what Daddy McBride has got to show you. - Dolly! What the... - I thought you'd be surprised. Thank you, Sergeant, you can leave that right there. Yes, sir. Well! Sit down. And now, Miss Ireland, why did you beat it? - I didn't beat it. - Oh. - You just went away, huh? - That's it. Took a little trip... or started to. Hm... And just when was it that you decided to take this little trip? On the spur of the moment. It was just after Chuck was killed, wasn't it? - Why, I... - Chuck was going around drunk... and you were afraid that he was going to pop off... ...about you and him getting together to rub out Tiny Torgensen, wasn't that it? - No! - Didn't you put Chuck up to killing Torgensen? No! No! You killed Chuck with a bottle, didn't you? You killed Chuck with a bottle and Fitz took the blame for it. No, I tell you, no! - What is this? - Fitz confessed to killing Chuck. But things don't hang together. I checked up on it. It was only five minutes after they heard a noise of a fight in Chuck's room... ...that they found Chuck dead. Fitz had to finish the fight, wash his hands and wipe out a lot of fingerprints, all in five minutes. Now, if he did that, and just for the sake of argument, let's suppose that he did. Why should he leave the hotel with his hat bashed in... ...and wiping his hands on a handkerchief? Oh, no, Fitz didn't kill Chuck, he was just covering you up. - You killed him! - I didn't! I didn't! Now you listen to me, young lady. Something was stolen from an envelope when Chuck was killed. Fitz didn't know about that. He was suprised when I told him. - Open your bag. - No! - Alright, I'll open it. - You leave it alone. Come on, Dolly, give me the key. - Send Blyfuss in! - He isn't here. Well, he must be, he just left here! He just left. Well, get hold of Haymes and shoot him in. - Your office? - Yeah, my office! Right away! Now, crying won't get you anything. - Oh... what did you find? - Not a thing. - Blyfuss! - What time did you say Chuck was murdered? Not later than a quarter to three. That's very funny. Dolly was with me from 1:30 to 3:00. At the English Chophouse eating, in case you want to check up. Well, I'll be... After all my... - What do you want? - I don't want anything, you sent for me. Well, what did you find out? The two slugs we found in Torgensen's body don't match these. Chuck never killed Torgensen with that gun. What about the two empty chambers? There's no sign of them having been loaded. Why, Chuck hasn't even fired this gun. Alright, Haymes, you may go. And take Miss Ireland with you. Let her go. And you get out of here too, Torchy Blane. No... Stick around, I wanna talk to you. - Okay, Daddy McBride. - Alright, I was wrong! Right! Ever since we started, you've been trying to kick the props out from under this case! Why don't you do something constructive for a change? Alright. I didn't have a chance to show you this before, I picked it up in Chuck's room. It's a piece of an old envelope but that tear is new. Now, whoever killed Chuck killed him to get the letters out of that envelope. He had something on somebody. - Why didn't you show me this before? - Oh, well, I was... I know, you don't remember. Well anyway, this gives us a motive for Chuck's murder. Fear. Fear that he might expose someone. Maybe this Corson. Right. Corson's address is Boston, Torgensen came from Boston. That ties up the two murders. Well, I'll check with the Boston police... No, I've already done that through my newspaper! The address is the Sherman Apartments, But there's no record of any Corson ever having lived there. Thanks. Oh, dear, if we could only get the date on that letter. Yeah, that stops us again. You've eliminated Dolly Ireland, and ballistics show that Chuck didn't kill Torgensen Well, that's two strikes on you, skipper, one more and you're out. Never mind about that. Let's assume that the motive for both murders was the same. and that someone by the name of Corson is the guilty party. Now, the only person we know who's close to both the dead men... ...is Fitz Mularkey. We don't believe he did it because we think he's covering for somebody else. Maybe Fitz is smarter than we think he is. He might be trying to throw us off. Maybe he's covering himself. I've got it! The answer to the whole thing. We've got to find Fitz. You're telling me Fitz is Corson and he killed Torgensen himself? I'm not telling you anything. Come on, skipper, let's go. - Go where? - To Marcia Friel's to find Fitz. - What makes you think he's there? - If you were Fitz, where would you be? You win, come on. What a night, what a night! I love the night, and the stars. They're like a symphony. What do I see? Probably spots before your eyes, you'd better see a doctor. No... what? Wait here. Come on. Oh, Gahagan. Telephone me at this number in ten minutes. Oh, sure, call you in ten minutes. What'll I say? Well, say anything at all, recite a poem, anything. - Hey, look what's on this side. - Maybe that'll be an inspiration for you. I'll say, oh boy, ain't that a honey? There is an "instipation", Hm! Well, hello there! Come on in. How are you, Mr. Friel? We're looking for Fitz. - He hasn't been here. - Oh, good evening, Marcia. - Good evening. - How do you do, Miss Friel? - Do you know where Fitz is? - No, I don't. But I do know he didn't kill Chuck Cannon. - He told me that he did. - But if he told you that... I mean, I thought you were looking for him. - I am, he got away. - We've got to find him, Marcia. It's for his own good. I told him, I begged Fitz to let the police handle everything. - Why, he's crazy, he must be. - Oh, Lewis. But I spent weeks and months arranging this deal, corporation papers and everything. Fees, day and night work! I'm no millionaire, I can't afford to go on... - Lewis, please be quiet. - Are you sure that Fitz isn't here? I haven't seen him since early this morning. - If you don't mind, I'll take a look. - But I tell you he's not here! Now just a moment, I want the truth. You're close to him, both of you, why don't you tell me where he is? I don't know. Can't you understand, I want to take him myself personally. If I don't, if I have to send out a general alarm, he'll be killed. He's threatened to shoot it out, he'll be riddled! The fool. Now, Miss Friel, why did Fitz kill him? Did it have something to do with you? Let her alone, McBride, he'll tell you what she knows. Well, let's have it! Come on, Marcia, tell him, it can't hurt Fitz now anyway. Oh, all right. I feel as though it's all my fault. I feel as though I were more guilty than Fitz. Yesterday Chuck met me just as I was leaving my apartment. He told me that I was the cause of everything that had happened. And that if I didn't go away and leave Fitz alone, he'd kill me. I was terrified. I told Fitz but he promised me not to do anything foolish. He agreed that I was to go back to my home and wait for him... ...and he'd join me there. - Where is your home? - Why, er... it's New York. You see, Marcia and I, we, er... Marcia, I'm sorry, this is news. I must ask you a few questions. Oh, please, how can you at a time like this? Please, Mr. Friel, your family, I want to know something about them. Your parents, who are they, are they living in New York? Our parents are dead. Really, must we go into that at this time? Thanks, that's all I wanted to know. Now I have something to say. Miss Friel, I arrest you with the murder of Chuck Cannon. Why, how can you possibly... Are you crazy, McBride, you know better than that! - Come on! - Let go of her. - I ought to kill you for this. - Fitz! I apologize, Miss Friel, but I knew that was the only way I could bring him out. I was wrong about you, McBride, you're just a cheap flatfoot. Why didn't you send your bulls after me, I gave you plenty of chance. Answer that. Hello? - It's for you. - Oh, that's my paper. - Be careful what you say. - Hello? Hello, Torchy, this is Gahagan. "A fool there was and he made his prayer, even as you and I, a rack of bone and a hank of hair, even as you and I..." No! You don't say. "Even as you and I Even as you... and I." Well, I'll be right in, Maxie. Mr. Friel, you just told me your parents were both dead. You didn't know that Marcia had already told me they were both living. - What are you getting at? - My paper just informed me... ...that they've solved the Torgensen and Cannon killings. The murderer has just been identified through a Boston milliner... ...and a photographer as a woman by the name of Corson. Oh! Come on, McBride, take me in, you know I killed Chuck. You won't be so anxious to protect her when you know the truth, Fitz. Get your hands up, all of you! So you've got it all figured out, eh? Sure I've got it all figured out. You're not brother and sister, you're a couple of cheap crooks... ...trying to take him over for all he's got. Come on, Marcia, let's get out of here. So that's the gun that killed Torgensen, eh, Friel? One move out of you and you'll be next. - Marcia, how could you? - Oh, shut up! Quiet, sucker! Open the door, Marcia. Lewis! Stay where you are! Torchy, look after Fitz. Fitz, are you all right? Give me emergency! Well, Fitz, I hope this will be a lesson to you. Yeah, it's what I get for trying to step out of my own class. I know where I belong now. - Then you're not going to sell out? - No, I'm sticking. Aw, gee, that's swell, Fitz. I just saw Marcia, Fitz. She talked. - Want to hear it? - Yeah, sure. Friel planned the whole thing. He wrote to Marcia Corson in Boston and told her to come here and pose as his sister. You fell for it just as they planned. Things were going swell until Torgensen came along. He'd known them both in Boston as a pair of sharpshooters. So Friel had to kill Tiny to keep from being exposed. So that was the setup, huh? Well, what about Chuck? Chuck must have had a hunch that they were phonies. He got a hold of some old letters that Friel had written to Marcia Corson. Letters telling about the whole scheme. Chuck was on the point of exposing Marcia unless she cleared out. So Friel went to the Shane Hotel and chalked up another murder. And I thought Marcia had killed Chuck in self-defense. She told you that to protect Friel. We knew all along you were covering up somebody. - Dolly! - Hello, Fitz. I think everything's going to be okay now. Not with me it isn't! You haven't explained to me yet... ...how you traced that scrap of letter to Marcia Corson! Oh... um, I was just pulling a fast one. But you nearly spoiled everything when you pulled Dolly off that train. - Dolly? - I wanted to help you, Fitz. Torchy and I had the same hunch about Marcia. So I got into her apartment, found a hat with a Boston label... ...and a picture by a Boston photographer. I figured that they'd prove Marcia's real name was Corson. And that's why Dolly was on her way to Boston. What did you do with the hat and the photograph? Dolly was wearing the hat when you nabbed her and... I presented the picture to Gahagan. Well, you were lucky to get away with it. Yeah, it's a lucky thing you've got Torchy. Yes, right, right... But he doesn't appreciate anything I do. All right, all right, I'll pat you on the back. You're great, you're colossal! - You ought to be a detective. - So ought you. It don't make any difference what I was, I'd never be able to figure out what goes on in that dizzy brain of yours. It's gonna take the rest of your life to find out. All right, I'll take your job. - Are you proposing to me? - Well... yes! Say, you two. This is a hospital. - Oh, we're sorry. - Forgive us. Maybe she'll feel better if I take her out and feed her. - Let's eat. - Oh, darling! - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
