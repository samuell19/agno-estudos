Levoton Veri (1946) So, so, so, so, so Stop kicking, girl I would, but it tickles so nicely That's good, the foot will soon get better that way Doesn't this feel good? Yes, it does That's what I thought, it will be fine Now we'll put the foot to rest Oh, the doctor is so good, taking care of poor me Is it, is it going to be shorter now? I don't think so but we'll have to perform - a small operation later in the autumn We have agreed that you will travel to Leipzig - to Doctor Grin. He will fix your foot The doctor is so terribly cute Cute, really? No woman - has ever called me that before But you are not a woman yet, are you? Excuse me! Aren't I a woman? Not yet Well, almost anyway, - or what does the doctor think? Fi-fiuuuu!! You may be right, woman And such a pretty one, too Yes, other boys say so, too Well? Well? Isn't the doctor going to give me a kiss? You'll be fooling lots of boys yet I think that's fooling, - when you call a woman pretty but don't kiss her But you are not quite a woman yet - so, put those kisses out of your mind and have a rest If you are really good you can get up in the afternoon - to try out your chair and maybe even play a little Oh, how nice you are There's the kiss after all But I don't regret it, not at all Not many women do Tell me, dear doctor, after the operation, - can I, can I still dance? Absolutely, I promise you that Good bye, little woman, I'll come back soon Bye, bye Doctor and thank you so very much about So very pretty, nearly a woman Ouh, what a pig Well, what did the doctor say?

I didn't want to stop There's this German who's done an experiment - and I wanted to check it. - Talking of Germany, - isn't it strange that Outi stays abroad all these years? Yes, her foot should have got better ages ago, - but I guess music studies take their time, too - and, anyway, who knows what a young lady will get up to? Come on, I miss you It is so warm and lovely near you Shall I put the lights out? - Not yet, I'm afraid of the dark Afraid of the dark? There are no other bogeys than me here No, I'm not afraid of bogeys, - but somebody stealing you from me in this darkness Don't be afraid, I'm never going to give you up, never Don't ever give up Good morning, dear Hello. - Hello May I see that hat in the window? Yes, thank you. - Here you are What was that? Valter, Valter! - Oh my God! Martti, my son, what is the matter? No, no, no, it's impossible, - impossible, - he's gone How is this possible? I was buying a hat and Martti slipped out into the street - and then a car! You were buying stupid fineries for yourself - and let the boy run into his death? There we have a mother, this is your fault I hate you I hate you more than anything in this world I will never forgive you, never Couldn't you forget? It was a long time ago No, I cannot help it But you know how I have suffered Isn't that enough to expiate what you call my crime? Yes, yes, I know all that, my reason knows it, - but my feelings blame you, and I cannot help it My love, you must be able to forget But I cannot You know what the child means to me He was my son, my only son - and if but you cannot have a child any more Don't torture me! Don't you think that I am just as bitter about it than you are? That is why I need you just now more than ever Don't leave me alone Come on This cannot go on We must find each other again We must start living again No, I cannot, not yet, anway Perhaps one day Brandy, double Another, please Two more Out... Out I say! Crazy man Martti, Martti... Do you remember what it was like here before? Cozy and warm And now You have gone away and he... Do you remember how I used to be afraid of the dark? I was afraid that someone would take you away from me, - and now you have gone You left me Please, take me back again Take me into your arms, caress and keep me warm I miss all of this so much that I'm going crazy What does the doctor want? - Vichy-water It's in the fridge, I'll bring Thank you, I'll take the bottle Oh dear, the doctor looks tired I am tired Good night, doctor. - Good night I am so bloody tired Do you mind, girl May I sit down? Of course, doctor I am so lonely, - so completely alone You are a good, kind girl I have admired you for long, you and your youth You could make me happy, - much happier than Oh, what am I talking about? I suppose it'll be all right one day You are a good girl, good night What was that? Sylvi! Valter, Valter, what is the matter? I cannot see, nothing, although my eyes are open Tell me for God's sake, tell me Oh my God Blind Withered Withered like me, - but maybe you come back to life one day Perhaps I have also won something by becoming blind I cannot see, but maybe he sees me now Good morning, dear, I have good news for you. - Good? I am afraid of all news But everything is all right Not so well that it couldn't be better You know doctor Brauner - Who? Brauner, that famous eye specialist? He is on his way here via Sweden, - and I, the smart guy that I am, called him in Stockholm - and made him promise that he will see you If anyone can help you, it is him I am completely blind, I don't believe anyone can cure me And I am not sure if I want to be cured, either What kind of talk is that? Remember how I used to be afraid of the dark? I was afraid that someone steals you. - Darling But now that I am in darkness, I am no longer afraid I have great light, - your love Darling, you and I belong together Nothing can separate us Now I must go to the practice again You'll be alright? Yes, I'll be fine, I'll do some work, too Where did I leave the duster? Here. - Thank you Are you sure? You won't get too tired? Not at all, I must learn to move and live like this Bye. - Bye, bye One, two, three four, five, six seven, eight, nine Good afternoon, good afternoon. - Good afternoon Greetings from Paris After seven years, in my home country and at home Is Madam Sylvi at home? Is it you, Valter, didn't you go to work? Listen, I have something to say I have been thinking about our life Perhaps, after all, I am asking too much of you I am a burden to you You are young and ambitious, - life is open to you and I, I am like this Sylvi, Sylvi, what is the matter? Who are you? - Don't you remember me, little mother? I am Outi Can't you see? - No. I am blind Oh my God, what has happened? I took some poison by mistake Oh Sylvi, dear Sylvi. This is terrible Not any more, I have got used to living in my dark world But are you sure nothing helps? Oh, this is terrible, terrible Perhaps there is a small chance, - when Dr. Brauner comes. Please don't. Put your head up I am not crying any more, either Or Valter. You spoke so strangely of him It was nothing, let's forget it And no more talking of me I'd rather you told me how your foot is It has been well for a long time already That is wonderful, no problems then? No, nothing at all Now you will stay with us, little Outi, - and take very good care of us all But auntie, I think I'll go and see her now What about him, Valter? Does he want me to stay here with you? Of course, he has always liked you And I liked him I liked him as all patients like their doctors Bye, bye, I'm going upstairs to see auntie now Bye, bye, be sure not to frighten her And the queen of hearts there But little girl, dear little cripple Cripple? I'm not cripple, not in the foot or heart, - I am healthy, joyful and happy But you naughty girl, why did you stay away for so long? Convalescence took a long time And now you are completely healthy? Yes. Yes ll am. I am healthy as anything But she... Sylvi That is right. Now she is a cripple Hello Sylvi. - Hello I have something very interesting for you I have ordered this specially for you What is it? - A book What do I do with a book, I cannot see? No, but you can feel. Give me your hand Do you feel anything? Yes, I can feel dots Can you feel, here is one dot? It is A This is two dots. This is B This is C And here is D But this is easy So it does This is G, this is H This is I. This really is easy Don't you recognize me, Valter? No It is Outi My goodness, are you little Out, - who wore short skirts and had freckles on her nose? Welcome, we have waited a long time for you And your foot... Is it completely healed now? Yes, yes it is. I could even dance, - as you once promised Look, like this, and this Don't I manage well? - Yes, very well Forgive me, Sylvi, I have been stupid Well, where were we Valter I didn't quite get it yet This wasthis was I, here is U This is K And this is J, and again A Reading. Hurray, it won't take you long to learn to read Let's continue: - D-0-G, dog This is easy L-1-F-E- life I - S, is W-0-N-D-E-R F-U?I Wonderful. - Life is wonderful That's not true, but never mind T-H-E The sun I- S S-H-1-N-1-N7G is shining The sun is shining What are you doing, Valter? I'm - I'm just admiring - this beautiful evening sun Good morning, Miss What are you talking about here? No - no, I'm just talking to myself Listen, Valter, tell me, - what does Outi look like after all these years, - I cannot see her? Well, Outi you mean? Outi. - Well, she has become a real little dame, - curly hair and pretty eyes, - and her mouth, her mouth is like it was made for kisses And her figure, her figure, I must say, - that her figure is extremely well developed - and her legs, her legs is pedigree, pedigree legs All together very agreeable You seem to have had time to study her closely With a professional eye, I mean as a doctor Could I have the salt, please? Salt, please? Why are you so quiet, don't you like the food? No, the food is good and the world is wonderful I have somehow began to live again Yes, you two can enjoy light, life and colors Perhaps you'll be back in the world of light soon Let us wait what Dr. Bruner has to say I am used to darkness, I don't miss company there Don't say that, I, too, have lived in the darkness, - but now I'm going to fight my way into the sun Be careful not to burn yourselfin the sun It's ten o'clock and the doctor is waiting I'll take you. - No, I don't want you to Of course, I will. - Thank your, but I'd rather - hear the verdict alone. And you have your practice What are you reading? That was not nice in the bathroom I thought it was very beautiful Why did you caress my hand just now? Because I like you You must not like me that way Not any more Well, it doesn't look very promising, - but if you continue the treat- ment for another two years, - your eyes may get slightly better, - so that you can see a little, but you won't be able to read There is another possibility, but it is dangerous I could try an operation and you could get your sight back - immediately, but the operation is complicated, - it could fail, and then you'd be blind for the rest of your life It is much safer to continue with the slower treatment I can't wait. It's terrible to be blind, when life passes by People grow and get on They don't wait for me May I think about it? - Of course But remember, that the operation is dangerous - and you would have to travel with me to Switzerland, - because I don't have my special instruments here - which are necessary in the operation Don't worry, it will be fine, rest and sunshine to you Thank you, good bye. - Good bye Where did you get that from? Oh, you remember Do you remember then, in that summer, - you were whistling this and Sylvi came to you in love And I You? Poor me, I was laying in my bed crying Crying? Yes, crying out of love and jealousy Jealousy? Were you jealous? - I must have been very silly I loved you with a little girl's whole heart I loved you like a little cripple loves her doctor You cannot imagine, how my poor heart suffered And every evening I had to hear about you from Sylvi It was horrible I loved and suffered like only a little school girl can do You, you didn't even notice the adoring heart at your feet Are you so sure about that? That's how silly I was then Finally I decided to run away, to get away from you Did you? I think I did What about now? Then it was just silliness, now it's plain impossible What is impossible now? N-no, nothing We were just talking of old summer memories What did the doctor say? - Yes, what did he say? There is not much hope, it can take years with my eyes Oh, dear Sylvi, lam so sorry for you Don't be pessimistic, everything will be all right, - as long as you manage to keep your nerve. - Yes You seem nervous today, Outi? - Yes, I am I'm worried about their fate After all, we were so happy then Sylvi was beautiful and Valter... Yes, he has always been very handsome Maybe too handsome There is something in him It seems that he has too much of that something? What are you studying? I was waiting for you to tea The table is set There we are, everything is ready here There is some tea here Outi, come and have some tea No, thank you, not just now But then you can give us a small tea concert It's a long time since you last played to us It's a pleasure Play something that I, too, can understand Why did you stop? Please continue What is the matter with Outi? I don't know. - Aha! That's where you are Outi, I have something to say to you Come, I have thought about you and me I also wanted to talk with you Is that you, Valter? This is a dangerous game. - What do you mean? You know very well. - What do you mean? You must have guessed and Sylvi knew, - why I stayed away for so long. Didn't you? It was a little girl's love, but it endured It took me a long time to get back to normal And I want to stay that way Do you understand? Everything was a mistake from the beginning Yes, perhaps, but now you must remember, - that Sylvi is your wife and I am only your sister-in-law Do you understand? Yes, I understand So, that is what I wanted to tell you I must get my sight back I am ready to risk anything for that It is very dangerous. - I know You must operate. - But that is not wise. Wise or crazy, I want to try one last thing. If it fails, I accept my fate. - All right So, we will travel to Switzerland But blame yourself, if disaster happens I already blame myself for everything Good bye, doctor. - Good bye, Madam Sora This is crazy. What if you loose your sight for good? I'm living through the darkest time now I must find the light But I cannot even be with you then I have promised to take care of Dr. Lehtinen's patients Someone has to take you to Switzerland and take care of you Me of course, and if I were Sylvi, I would do the same Perhaps it will be all right without the operation I doubt it. It won't be all right More light A little more More Careful More light That's enough Do you see anything? No, nothing More light Oh my God, how that hurt my eyes Hurt, do you see something? Yes, I seel seelight Tell me, for good's sake, was the operation successful? Keep your eyes closed and the black bandage on I cannot promise anything yet, but there are possibilities Well, my darling, how are you today? I don't know yet Have they written? Yes, yes, almost every day. Outi is so worried for you What about him, Valter? He sent you flowers Here you are Oh, roses They must be dark red I wonder if he will remember me? Of course he will ll can see ll can see Well, well, well, what is happening here? You must remember that you must use - still use dark glasses at least a year - and be careful of harsh light, - because it can affect your nerves so that - you may become blind, or even mentally ill Have you told them at home about the operation's success? No. This will be a surprise for everyone All the time I feel that I am doing wrong I feel Sylvi's accusing look on my face And still, I am so happy, so happy I wanted this short time of complete happiness to myself I want to feel you this close, my darling This must end when she comes No, no, you belong to me. I will never let you go Just think if she gains her sight She will see everything I cannot think of that now You, you are here Sylvi. - You came back already Oh dear Sylvi, how did the operation go? - Well Tell me, tell me quickly It failed, ... for good Sylvi, you are crying No, my dear, I was just rinsing my eyes They have been hurting again Oh, dear Sylvi, I feel so sorry for you Don't feel sorry for me, I don't like it I'd rather hear how you are, what has it been like, - while I've been away? - Wonderful, we have... I have been swimming, playing tennis, - and running myself tired every day What about Valter, has he been good? - Like an angel He has been serving on me like a child I mean, whenever he's had time from his work Where have you slept? In my own room, of course, upstairs What about him? - Who? Valter In the corner room, I think, I don't know for sure It has been very nice here I can believe that Has he kissed you? Kissed, who? - Valter You are crazy No, but I know men Forgive me. Stupid. - Sometimes I hope - that he'd find another woman, who would care for him But not you, you are not for him, or what do you think, Valter? You have not learned to move quietly enough yet I was just passing. - I know Take me to bed Valter, this is a bit difficult. Could you help? Valter! - What? Nothing All right, that's it Valter What, my love? - Come What did you say? Nothing Good night, my dear Sleep well Good night Valter! Did you call me? - Where are you going? I'm going to bed, my dear. - Where? In my own room, of course Good night, my darling I cannot stand this any more. You are always near me, - and yet so far away Valter, don't you think I also suffer? It is terrible to deceive her All the time I feel the accusation in her blind eyes But it is even worse to deceive oneself I have imagined that I would some day be free of you I thought that you'd be happier with Sylvi This is all a deceit Now I know that I'll never be free of you, - and I also know that you are happy in my arms The two of us belong together That is the truth. - It is the truth Valter, I can bear it no longer Come Get up! Good morning, dear Outi Did you have a good night? I hope you slept well without nightmares You look so pale How can you know that? I just feel it, Outi dear, I just feel it Goodness, have you started to smoke? Sometimes in the evenings Please don't, it is very dangerous, very dangerous Whose watch is this? Valter's watch How come it's here? I don't know. He may have forgotten it sometime Yes, Valter forgets sometimes actually too much And they were bound together like with invisible chains There were three of them and they lived under the same roof, - three people who loved and hated each other They were sisters, Kaarina and Lea and between them - had come a man, a man who belonged to Kaarina, - and whom Lea lured to her with deception and sin, - as there is no greater sin, than deceiving one's sister It is the work of a thief and adulterer But when night came the man crept from his conjugal bed - and went to his wife's sister and sin united them Then they forgot the one who was alone and suffered, - suffered terrible pain, - suffered enough to lose her mind, which she did But one day something terrible happened Perhaps I am boring you, maybe you don't want to hear more Where did you get a book like that? From the library, of course, it is very educational One must not play with sin, it's dangerous, - very dangerous What happened to them? Them? - The people in the book? What happens when the conscience starts to fester - day and night, dig and gnaw, tear and bite? The nights are sleepless. Fear and terror enter the soul, - nerves start to break and there is no way out They want to escape, escape at any cost But where and how? And they did the only thing that could free them What did they do? They killed themselves They killed themselves. Oh my God, forgive us She knows. She suspects, that you and I She cannot know she is blind after all But then, why did she read that story to us? I am afraid of her blind eyes The way she stares at me is awful Almost as if she is be able to see Where are you going, you cannot leave me alone here? I'm going to work, you go to your room Nothing is going to happen. - Don't go, don't go This cupboard, it is my old acquaintance Those bottles. In here there is blindness No, no, blindness would be too easy This, he must drink from this They killed themselves They killed themselves This would also free me Shall I drink, shall I drink? You, why did you come just now? Why wouldn't 17 Do you have something to hide? Do you have a bad conscience? Can't you tell everything to your little mother, like you used to? You are moving along dark paths, Outi It is dangerous. Be careful not to fall in the dark Glass, what is in it? That is... juice Juice? I am thirsty No, no, no You! Why are you here? You know that you are not to come here They suspect us too much already Go away. Do you hear me, go away! I don't want you messing me up here as well What are you staring at, are you mute? I am expecting a child Your child Child? She is expecting a child You are expecting a child, my child You and I, we are going to have a child God bless you Valter, you are not sorry? How could I be sorry? A child is the biggest wish of my life My love, my love We are going to have a child, you and I Think, just think about the eyes of the child, - the little hands, the sweet sounds of a child We'll see it grow and develop We'll see our own lives continuing better - and more beautiful Now we have something to live for - and something to fight for Oh my love, my love Thank you for helping me over the worst What shall we do now? She must release us She will never do that. - Never! There must be a way. I will force her You will force, who, are you talking to yourself, Valter? How did you get in here? The maid let me in, she went to the shop Well, how did your experiment go? I don't know yet, it takes time I suppose so. You must be ex-perimenting with perfume, or what? You forgot your hat, Outi. Don't let me disturb you Not at all I just came to... - Well Yes, you see, Outi has been complaining of her nerves - and it was my intention to examine her All right, how nice. And have you examined her? Not yet. - In that case you can do it right away We'll see what is the matter with her nerves. Take your coat off I thought I should go to Dr. Salonen Take the coat off and your blouse You needn't be shy in front of your brother-in-law I think you have slep very restlessly at night lately Is there something the matter? No, nothing Sometimes I fancy I have heard you cry in your room Surely you are not in love? I am really worried about you You must take care of your nerves - No, no, no Valter will cure you. He is the specialist Cough once... more cough Breath in... cough... breathe More, breathe Look, she sees Do you see? - What should I see? My glasses just pressed on my nose Well, Valter, did you find anything? No, no I cannot bear it any longer Neither do I Put your glasses on. - No, I can see better without Oh dear, you are wearing such an ugly tie today, darling Sylvi, you can see Yes, I can see Don't you think that's fun, my darling? Oh Sylvi, Sylvi that's wonderful It's no fun to see everything What about the operation? The operation didn't fail. I have been able to see - and I have watched already a long time But then you must know? Yes, I know very much Oh God, this theatre, - but now it must end I have waited for this a long time By the way, I must congratulate you, - you play lovers very convincingly We are not acting Outi and I, we love each other How romantic And here's me thinking that you are just playing about, - as you always have... in my house But you are not asking, - whether I love, or even if I have loved I did love and I suffered I suffered so that it nearly made me mad and and I did Hate and revenge burned in my veins day and night In my desperation I tried to kill myself, - but didn't in the end I decided to kill you, - but it would have been too easy for you Live and suffer, suffer like I have suffered Then I decided to torture you, - torture you until one day you yourselves... Decided to commit suicide? You guessed right, my dear friend And I swear that you all - the all of you will do it All three What do you mean? - Exactly what you were thinking You three. Not me So you know? - Think about it, I know So you know that I shall be a mother? You will not be a mother Valter is a doctor What do you mean? - Exactly that You are a doctor Remember that Valter, Valter, did you see her eyes, that murderous look? I am afraid, afraid Ah-a, there the lovers come There is a letter for you, I put it on your table It is time to take the masks off, Outi. You are a thief You have stolen my man and lived in sin with him, - and you have stolen a child from me, - which I would otherwise carry in my womb I hate and despise you, Outi And you, my faithful husband You have lived faithfully with two sisters You are married to one, and are having a child with another This could mean a scandal, - labeling you for the rest of your life I demand that the child must die, - or I will stir up such a storm, that it'll break Valter's career - and I'll torture you, Outi, until you are as crazy as I am There is another option. There is a pistol in my drawer Choose I wish you a pleasant time together, - until I return day after tomorrow. Your loving sister, Sylvia Oh my God, what a terrible person What are we going to do now, what shall we do? I don't know, but one thing is sure, our child is not going to die You are guilty, you alone Are you going to kill their child as well? No, no Outi and Valter, you both dear people Forgive me I am sick and crazy, my nerves are finished It is not always easy to stay stable, - but now I understand clearly, - that it is time for me to step aside I am only a shadow of a certain past You still love each other Life and future belong to both of you And 1, for myself I want finally peace Be happy and love each other Forgive me, if you can Subtitles: Timecode Finland Oy
