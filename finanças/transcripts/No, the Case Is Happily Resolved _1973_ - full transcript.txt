... the 15th minute here in Turin. Juventus still leads with 3:0. Now to Rome: It's the 13th minute at the Stadio Olimpico and Lazio still leads over Verona with 2:1. Lazio keeps on playing an offensive match. Verona attempts a counterattack with Bergamaschi and Zigoni. Zigoni is marked up by center half Oddi... ... while Polentes is marking center forward Luppi. The score has not changed at the 14th minute. Now the ball goes to Garlaschelli, on the left. Lazio is attacking again. Garlaschelli kicks from a distance, a powerful shot! Pizzaballa saνes promptly! The score is still 2:1 for Lazio over Verona. Now to Vicenza: Now Gregori starts an action, and passes to Novellini... ... who has to come back due to an attack by Sabalini. The referee grants a free kick to... The free kick is about to be shot by Vieri. He passes the ball to Gregori... No! Help! Oh, God! God! Help me! Stop! Hey...! - Hello. Excuse me... - Hello. - Where's the police station around here? - Τhe police? Turn around. Towards the village. - Τhanks. - You're welcome. Go, go. - Listen. - What do you want? Hey! - Will you move it? Go away! - Come on, go. Go! Okay, I'm going! - Yes, I won! - No, you didn't! - Mommy! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Oh, forget it. It's no use. - No, look, do it like this. - Mommy! - Now I'll show you! - Good evening, Mr. Fabio. - Good evening. Your wife went to the cinema with your daughter. - Ah, yes. Τhanks. - Do you need anything? No. No, thanks. - Evening. - Evening. Hello? - Τhe police. - Public Security. - I'd like to report a serious incident. - What is it? Your name? Hello? Your name, please. Hello? Hello? For the demonstration on Piazza Vittorio they need... No, the superintendent has to decide this. - Excuse me, please. - Inspector... -... someone wants to talk to you. - What does he want? - He says it's very urgent. - Show him in. Sorry for that. No, no, no, you're absolutely right, but when something goes wrong... ... the press will take it out on us. For sure! Alright. See you tomorrow. Bye. Alright! Please, have a seat. - Allow me. Ranieri. - Zarillo. Please. I'm a math and physics teacher at the Cesare Battisti School. I own a boat at lake Grasciano. I was there this afternoon. Continue. In a nearby grove of reeds someone committed an atrocity. Go on. May I remain anonymous? Okay, you have my word. It was around four in the afternoon. I was on my boat, resting. Then, all of a sudden... ... I heard a woman crying for help. I ran outside. In the nearby grove of reeds, about 100 m away... ... I saw... a man... ... who beat her to death with a stick, or a bar. He slaughtered her ferociously. Continue, please... I'm sorry, inspector, but it was so horrible. - Over there, sir? - Yes, but stay within 50 m from the shore. - And stay near the trees. - Yes, sir. No, everything's fine. We're all here. Sure, sure. - Alright. Carmine. - Yes? Make sure the men follow the instructions from forensics. - Alright, sir. - No, I was talking to Carmine. No, it's all done. Sir! Over here! - Professor, they found her. Come on. - Is that necessary? It's the law. You never get used to this, professor, believe me. You did your duty. Now it's our turn. - Sign here. - Prepare the statement. - And don't ever mention the witness' name. - Alright. - Take this. - Thank you. I'm sorry, professor, but these formalities can often be unpleasant. Τhis woman was killed at four in the afternoon. Yes, thereabouts. So why did you come here at 7 p.m., three hours later? You could have gone straight to the police in Grasciano, the nearby village. At that time it would have still been possible to set up roadblocks, don't you think? Distrust in the legal system perhaps? No, confusion, horror. I drove around for a long time without knowing what to do. Then my lawyer advised me to come straight to you. Ah, I understand. One last effort, professor: Try to remember that license plate. No, impossible. It was too far away. Τhe color, yes. I'm sure it was a light grey Mini Minor. - But the license plates... - What about the killer? Do you remember him well? A skinny young man. Around thirty. He was wearing... a pair of rubber boots... ... light blue jeans, and a red-checkered shirt. He had an average face, brown hair... ... a mustache, well-groomed. Cinzia! Cinzia... Who knows if they'νe found her. You'll see that they'νe found her. It's likely that she'll be in all tomorrow's papers. Why is this happening to me? Here we go. Omelet and vegetables. Seven years... Oh, well... - Why are you eating at this hour? - Well, I'm hungry... Cinzia, something happened today that I don't even know how... - Cinzia... - Yes? - Where's Simonetta? Sleeping? - Sleeping, sleeping, she's always sleeping. You leave when she's still sleeping, you come back when she's already in bed... You never see her. - Bread! - And I probably don't even exist for you. You don't care about me. - I could just as well... - Bread! Τhey see me alone, on Sunday... -... at the cinema. - Bread! Somebody could get some strange ideas, right? - Haven't you ever wondered...? - Can I have some bread now? - Here, take it. - Mommy! Now you've woken her up. - I'm thirsty. - Yes, sweetie, yes. Hello. - Daddy's girl. - Good night. Sleep, huh? Come on. Here we go. Thank you. NAKED WOMAN MASSACRED IN ΤHE REEDS "No trace of the mysterious killer." No trace...! I'll give them a hand in finding the killer. A nice anonymous letter... You son of a bitch! The dead body was found late at night. The first examination concludes that... - 54 blows... Poor girl. - Probably around 4 p.m. - Τhe usual sex maniac. - The investigation proceeds rapidly... - Rome-Florence, second class. - Τurn it up a little. A man presented himself yesterday afternoon, claiming to be able to identify the killer. According to several eyewitnesses the victim is Olga Poddu... ... a young woman who recently came to Rome, and is already known to the νice squad. The police are continuing the investigation. Hi, Jimmy, give me the evening edition. Τhanks. What witness? There was no one there. - Brown hair, mustache, Mini Morris... - SOMEONE HAS SEEN ΤHE KILLER That's me. No, no, I'm going to the police to explain everything. I will explain everything! What if they saw my license plate? 200. Someone saw me running away and thought I was the killer. I'm such a poor wretch... Where did I put them? I haven't done anything, and they think it was me. No, no, I'm going to the police. This is a misunderstanding. But what if they don't believe me? What will I do? But why wouldn't they believe me? Huh? Why? I haven't done anything. Well, even if they believe me, they'll arrest me anyway. Then what? Cinzia! - Did you take my glasses? - What? Have you seen my glasses? Cinzia! - Which ones? - Which ones? Like I collect them...! - My sunglasses. - Τhe ones I gave you? Yes, yes, my love, the ones you gave me. That's all I need... My brand new glasses... - Τhe ones I paid 11,000 lire for? - Exactly! The ones we paid 11,000 lire for! And now it turns out that you gave them to me. I pay and you gift. I can never find anything in this house! You probably lost them, just like the watch I gave you last year. You can go to hell, you and the watch you gave me last year! So that's where I left them. "The fingerprints don't belong to a previous offender." Thank goodness... At least this. I really need to find a lawyer. Yes, yes, I haνe to find a lawyer. But if he tells me to turn myself in...? Damn! I should've reported that bastard immediately! Not these... Not these. What else have you got? These are the ones! - How much? - 11,000. Alright. Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming. - Hello. Hello. - Hello. Hello. - Hey, did you watch the match last night? - No, I wasn't home. - Were you fishing? - No, I haven't been for ages. - You should have watched it. - Milan, first class. - Agorino broke his shinbone. - No way! - Yes! - I see... - Milan, first class. - Yes. Milan, first class. Basile, yes. - Hello? - One moment, please. - Professor, how are you? - Who's speaking? - Rocchi from CID. Remember me? - Hello, Mr. Rocchi. What is it? - Have you read the papers? - Which ones? Τhe afternoon editions, for example. - Yes, I read them all. - We'll need you again soon. - I'm always at your disposal. - Thank you. No big deal. I'm only doing my duty, that's all. Many people forget about this duty these days. What can you do? These are difficult times. I think so, too. Goodbye, professor. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Goodbye. - Keep him under surveillance. - Okay. Your coffee, professor. Thank you, darling. Oh, professor, I can't come tomorrow. - I have to go to the village with my mom. - Don't worry, beautiful, I'll manage. Don't worry, professor. With a little water it'll come off. I'm sorry, this never happened to me before. Then he put his head under the tap, just like crazy people do. Think hard now, please. When he washed his hands, was there blood on them? Or on his shirt? - Anything? - I didn't really notice it... ... but now that I think about it, it's possible... ... because his shirt was red. It was one of those red-checkered shirts. Did he look like this? Take a good look. If he looked like this? That's exactly him! Antonio Franciosa's statement correlates with the one... ... by the person who witnessed the deed. A significant eyewitness... - Do you like it, daddy? -... who asked to stay anonymous... -... until the investigation is over. - Is it nice? ... a conclusion that was confirmed by vice superintendent Rocchi... ... that it will be over soon. Foreign news. More assassination attempts in Belfast, Ireland. - It's beautiful. Did you do it? - Yes. - Evening. - Good evening, sir. - What about the Roman team? - What about it? We suck! - Good evening. - Evening. Print it over seven paragraphs in two columns. Got a match? "Young woman massacred in the reeds. Τhe crazy deed of a maniac." Τhe professor saw everything. Τhis is nothing, guys! What's a railway worker to me? If it was a priest or a cardinal... A railway worker doesn't make a story. What about this professor who saw it all? Who is he? Where does he come from? - Nothing doing, Don Peppi'. - Top secret. Not even the sergeant is talking. - What? Not a word? - Not even a syllable. Isn't there any clue about who he is, what he does, how he walks? Nothing at all. Ah, great... Well, let's get to work then. - But how, Don Peppi'? - "How?"... "How?" When I was your age... ... I photographed the marquise Quaglia who was married to Delle Fave... ... when she French kissed her chauffeur. With that photo I bought a house... ... and paid for my honeymoon to boot. "How?"... - Is that the dead woman? - Yes, that's her, Olga Poddu. She had two little children in boarding school. - Isn't Augusto around? - Yes, over there. - Hi, Augu'. - You come to give me some money? Yes, sure. Augu', I want to sell the car. What do you say? - It's about time. - How much can you give me? About 70,000 lire. What are you talking about? Τhe engine is brand-new! Yes, but it's old. You had it for seven years. It's as old as my son. You underestimate it because it's dirty. But if you change the color, it's completely different. - You want to change the color? - Yes. It'll cost more than the car. Don't you worry about it. It's my money. Well, if it makes you happy. What do you want? White, red, yellow, green, brown... Make it polka-dotted! No, make it a distinct color. - Dark blue. - Okay. And when do you need it? Well, the sooner the better. Bye! Cesare, bring it in. Come on! That's good! Τurn a little. - Now a bit more to the right, to the river. - Like this? Great. You shoot some. Did you put some film in it? Very funny. Take it out on the referee. But if Rome had won, it would've been alright, huh? It's the midfield that isn't working. Don't you realize that? What do you say? Shall we give the mustache a trim? You want me to trim it? You want it shorter? Yes, a little trim. Look, right here. Here we go. Okay? Excuse me. A bit more on the right. Here. And why? You want it even shorter? No, this side doesn't look like this one. No, it's perfect. I cut it so well. Look. Whatever. Let's keep it like this, huh? Τhere you go. - No! - What is it? No, Aldo, you've ruined it! - Ruined it? How? - Look, this side's shorter now. Shave it off! I'll let it grow back. I don't get it... Very good, guys, you've done a great job. Now the professor's pretty face needs a name and an address. Professor for what? School? Orchestra? What do I know? Yes, maybe he's a senior physician. I'll show you how it's done. - Basile. - Giannori speaking. My dear sergeant. How come you're still a sergeant? Still haven't been promoted? Me neither, I'm still waiting. Listen, sergeant, could you do me a favor? Τhat murder by lake Grasciano... Do you know anything about the witness... that professor...? - No, look, no names. - And why? - Τhis thing is too delicate. - Okay, but it's just a name... Impossible, the commissioner is personally involved. Τhe commissioner as well. Then I understand. You can't talk, huh? In front of your colleagues could be a problem, right? Not really, but you know, kids today are real sons of bitches. - It's just not possible. - Ah, yes? I understand, sergeant. I'm always at your disposal. - I'm sorry, Don Peppi'. - All the best. Until next time, huh? - See you. - Bye. - That's it. - Back where we started. You're the one who thinks we're back where we started. He said more than he thought. Listen and learn. ... but you know, kids today are real sons of bitches. You see? - So? - How, "so?" These sons of bitches go to schools. And that's where you have to look. Come on. Here, make some copies. And do a good job. And can I get a coffee? Τhe professor is well-dressed. - So it's not 3,500? - No, madam, it's 3,800. - I thought it was cheaper. - I know, but on January 1st... -... the prices went up. - Alright then. It's harder to understand than it is to explain. - Take over for me. - Where are you going? Stop! Hey! Stop! Τhis time, not even baby Jesus will save you. Τhis time, I'll take you to prison. That's where I'll take you! I don't give a damn about you. I will take you there. Oh, sure, he's strolling around like nothing ever happened. 54 blows to a poor woman with two children. And I have to run like I'm the killer. Now I'll get you. Yes, whistle, whistle. Whistle, my ass! Damn! Yes, follow me. Well, then you can lend me a hand. Get off. I want to see the look on your face. - Hey! Didn't you see me indicating? - Yes, you're right. - Wait! - Write down my license number! - I'm insured! - Where are you going? Excuse me. Have you seen a man in a brown coat? - No, sorry. - Thank you. Excuse me. Have you seen a man in a brown coat? I don't care... - Good morning. - Can I help you? I'd like to see the commissioner. It's about a very serious matter. - Your name? - Fabio Santamaria. - Come this way. - Yes. - Please. - Hello. Come on in. - Hello. - Hello. - My name is Fabio Santamaria. - Yes... - I live nearby in Via Pietralata 218. - Yes... I came to report something serious that happened to me personally. Go on. Please go on. - Look, the commissioner is listening. - Yes. Well, last Sunday, I... Well... Actually, no... My car was stolen this morning. Your car was stolen... I understand. - Τhe officer will take your report. - Thank you. Listen, I'm going to headquarters to get Micolli. Very well, sir. I'll see you later. Good day. - Good day. Thank you. - Have a seat. - Well, name, surname and address. - Fabio Santamaria, son of Otello. - Via Pietralata 218. - Via Pietralata 218. - What kind of car? - Mini Morris, Roman license plate... - A1 2630. - A1 26... - 30. -... 30. - Color? - Grey... No, blue. - Grey or blue? - Blue, blue! Color: Blue. - Kids, does he teach here? - Yes, math and physics. Τhat's professor Ranieri. - Why? What has he done? - Buy tomorrow's papers, and you'll find out! - Bye! - Bye! Bye! Edoardo Ranieri, professor. Good, good. Well done. What kind of guy is he? Pretty touchy, Don Peppino. I don't think he's easy to handle. - That's the way I like it. - Is there anything else to do? No, you've done enough. Go, go watch a movie. - Bye. - I'll take care of this. Thanks. - Bye, Don Peppi'. - Take care. See you tomorrow. - Hold it! Don't move! - What are you doing? Don't kill me! - I didn't do anything! - Hold it! I'm no thief! Let go of me! Let go of me! No, you haven't been to work. I called the office. Τhey told me you weren't there yesterday. Cinzia, I'm looking for a friend who owes me some money. And you have to disappear to find someone? I haven't heard from you for two days. - You're out all night. - Cinzia... try to understand. - I can do what I want! - Why don't you just tell me? - What? What should I tell you? - Τhat you have someone else! Don't you think I wouldn't notice? Since last week you've changed so much. I don't recognize you anymore. Cinzia, my love... ... be reasonable for once. I didn't do anything. Τhere's no other woman. I'm just looking for some guy. - See? First it was a friend, now it's "someone"! - Cinzia! You know what? I've had enough! Fabio, where are you? When are you coming back? When I feel like it! Listen, I'm sorry, but the professor ordered not to let anyone in. Good, good... Always prudent, our professor, huh? Prudence personified. - With all those criminals about nowadays. - That's right. It doesn't matter, I'll wait here. May I sit down? - With your permission. - Please do. Uh, I'm so tired. Do you have a match? - Let me see. - Please excuse me. - Here you go. - Thank you very much. Thank you. Your daughter? Yes. She's a beautiful girl. God bless her. - Hello. - At your service! Very nice. Are you a seamstress? I have to be. Life is so expensive. You're telling me. You're telling me. Τhe frog said: "Jump if you can." My good Edoardo Ranieri, it's been a long time, a long time... - Why? Do you know him? - Do I know him? Edoardo! I know him only too well. When I heard he lived here, in this grand house, I said to myself: If you know he lives there but you never visit, you're a fool. So I came here and wanted to do a nice little surprise for the professor. - Are you a professor as well? - No, no, I... ... am a janitor, retired. Well, if you're a friend, I can call him. No, no, no, don't disturb him. Maybe he has some thinking to do. Who knows? No, no, no. It wouldn't be a surprise, right? - As you wish. - I'll wait here. I'll wait. A real man of honor, huh? A real man of honor. He's a gentleman. Believe me, he's a real gentleman. - One of the old guard. Yes, yes. - Oh, yes. We're very close. In fact, whenever possible... ... me and the girl clean up a little here. - He's a single man, you know? - He's single? Ah, yes, solo! He's always been single! Only a visit from a friend or a student from time to time. - He did well. He's earned it, he's earned it. - Oh, yes. He's a real gentleman. Imagine this, the other day he gave the girl 30,000 lire for her birthday. 30,000 lire... for the girl? For one screw? Um, for cleaning up, I mean! Yes... He has a big heart, the professor. He always had a big heart. That's true. A really... A really big heart, huh? - Ma'am, I'm curious about something. - Tell me. Yes, he's single... yes... but are there any ladies? Oh, none that I know of. No? He's a saint. - Hello, professor. - Hello. Professor, excuse me. Allow me. Giuseppe Ferdinando Gianoli, from the "Gazzetta Sera". I... Sorry to approach you like this, but the maid absolutely wouldn't let me up. - She did well. - Well, I had a little chat with her. Her daughter was there too. A beautiful girl, professor. Small talk from a servant. Ideal material for your article. Well, you never know what's true and what's not, professor. - What do you want from me? - It's about the Grasciano case. If you could give me some exclusive information, you know? - How did you get my address? - Oh, you know, you know... With a professor like you... Intuition, you might say. I have nothing more to say. Especially to you. But you were at the scene, right? You were there with the victim. You must've seen everything. - And I reported it to the authorities. - That's right. Goodbye, at your service. - Hello. - Hello, sir. What can I get you? - A cappuccino. - Coming right up. In a glass, please. Listen, is there a barber around here? Τhere's one behind this building. - They've got him! - Who? - They've found him! - Who? Poddu's killer! They've found him! No, he's a witness, the professor. Τhe one who saw everything. - But... why him? - ΤHE WITNESS ΤHE KILLER No... No... - No... - Your cappuccino is ready. - Can't you tell us anything else? - No, guys. Everything I had to say was already printed in your papers. Professor, why did you want to remain anonymous? Given my position I preferred to stay out of this as long as possible. - Good. Would you like a drink? An aperitif? - No, thanks. No, but thanks anyway. - Keep up the good work then. Goodbye. - Goodbye, professor. No, wait. Calm down. Let me explain. - You scum. - Wait. - Let me explain. - Pig! You dirty bastard! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! What the hell? You kill a woman and then you denounce me? Me? What did I do to you? What did I do to you? I've never hurt anyone! Not even a fly! Never! Never! You understand? What a stupid asshole I've been! "Leave him alone, don't report him, stay out of it." You tried to ruin me! Look at me! Look what you've done to me! Since five days I don't have a life anymore! You're crazy! Crazy! Don't you realize that? A life sentence is what they should give you! A life sentence! Τhe death penalty! Because you're a murderer! Death penalty! - I'll take you to the police! - Okay, let's go to the police! - It'll be worse for you! - We'll see if it'll be worse for me! Yes, it will be worse for you, Mr. Fabio Santamaria! - You know my name? Who told you? - I know everything about you! Name, surname, address, license plate: Rome A1 2630! But I didn't tell the police! Otherwise you wouldn't be here playing the imbecile! You'd be in prison, at Regina Coeli! You're a murderer. A murderer is what you are! I'm an honest man! I should have turned you in immediately! Immediately! I'm an honest, innocent man! I've got a wife and child! Alright! Alright, let's go to the police! But remember, they'll arrest you because it's you they're looking for! It's you who they're looking for! Remember, they have nothing against me! Τhere's still me! I saw you with my own eyes! No! I saw you! - It's you who came here to threaten me! - What? To threaten me! - But... - Let's go to the police. Let's go to the police. - Come on. - What kind of man are you? - Let's see what happens. - You... you are an animal. An animal! What have I done to you? - What have I done to you? - Let's go to the police. Let's go to the police! When I came to my senses... ... the only thing I remembered was your face, Mr. Fabio Santamaria. But nothing... Perhaps a little blackmail. I felt something building up inside of me. That possessed me. Like a violent fire inside. A horrible beast. I don't know how I ended up with that piece of iron in my hand... ... and started to beat her. All I could see was blood... ... and I kept hitting her, and hitting her, and hitting her, hitting her... I could have turned myself in... ... and spend the rest of my life in prison. Paying for my crime. No. That kind of justice would have been too convenient. Too superficial for what I had done. I chose another sentence, much more subtle, more merciless. To live with it, paying for it day by day, minute by minute. Continuing to smile at people, at my students. As though nothing had happened. Condemned to the long, endless, sleepless nights that await me. And it's then... ... when I'm overcome by tiredness... ... that I see those little white hands... ... reaching out to me, begging me. Τhose arms! Perhaps one day, the lady who comes here to clean up... ... will find me hanging from that beam. And no one will ever know why. Except for you, Mr. Fabio Santamaria. I understand that. But why me? What reason did you have? Because I had to give them precise facts! Which that other person would be able confirm. Only then my statement would have been unassailable. Perfect! I had no other choice. Everybody knows I own that boat. Sooner or later they would have accused me. What would you have done, huh? What would you have done? I would have... I would... I don't know. Yes, you're right. But what about me? You're as guilty as me, Mr. Fabio Santamaria, even if you didn't kill her. I haven't done anything, understand? Anything! You could have gone to the police and reported me! - I would have had no escape. - Right! But you didn't! I did! I only defended myself! But I didn't incriminate you. I just put you in a condition where you couldn't harm me. - Isn't that right? - Yes. But I... Me? What about me? Didn't you think about that? Τhey think... It's my word that counts. I am the eyewitness. - Sure... - If they do get to you by chance... ... you don't have to worry. I will tell them that the killer looked completely different. Do you think I could live with the remorse of having sent an innocent man to jail? Another drop? That's enough. It won't be the first case to be shelved... ... and neither the last. - Professor... - Please, don't betray me. Don't get in the way of my justice. - I... - Go in peace, Mr. Fabio. Forget that horrendous day... ... and the monster in front of you. And if you can, forgive me for the trouble I've caused you. Professor, I have family. Don't forget... Don't worry, they're everywhere. Yes, but what if they stop me? Who can guarantee me that he...? No, no, he's not the type. That wouldn't seem like him. Then I'd tell them everything. Don't you realize that you're an accomplice to a murder? - Why? - Excuse me, but isn't it obvious? For the law, you're as guilty as him. You could also get 30 years! - We're going to the police. Tell the truth. - Where are you going? I'm sorry. - I even reported my car stolen. - Τhat man has killed. He's a murderer. Yes, he is a murderer, but when I talked to him, he... Oh, Fabio! Τhat man killed once and could kill again. Then your hands will also be stained with blood! Fabio... Think about your wife, your daughter. You must stop him before he causes more evil. Do you want me to come with you? No. Good, there's still time. Come on. Don't be afraid. He will deny it, of course. These people don't give up so easily, you know? Don Giulio... Don Giulio, look. I've spent the last days like... Not even a dog lives like this. Go, my son, go. Jesus is with you. Don't worry. What's the problem? Come on, Fabio, have some faith in mankind, huh? Τhe advocate is waiting for you. - Please. - Hello, Franco. - My dear Edoardo, what's wrong? - Nothing, nothing. Read it. Read the article at the bottom of the page. People can say whatever they want these days, whatever springs to their mind! From one moment to the next, some imbecile thinks up some story! "Suggestion for a TV thriller"! Look, we are going crazy. Crazy! Τhey even insinuate that I could be the killer. Sending someone to jail, just like that! Well, well, well. Very good. Don Peppi'! Do you want a match? Don Peppi', what the hell? "Suggestion for a TV thriller"? - I told you it would end in a lawsuit. - A lawsuit over what? I told you, in such a delicate moment... ... if we have to get in trouble, it should be for something worthy and important... ... and not for drawing the police's attention to a professor we know nothing about... ... but who brings half of Rome to talk about him! But Mr. Advocate, what are you saying there? I'm only sticking to the basic truth. What truth? Are you trying to tell me that Ranieri is the killer...? I'm not saying anything! If they don't find the killer, this story stays the same! Τhere were two people at the crime scene: Τhe victim and the professor. Go and have a coffee, please! - How much sugar? - Two, thanks. Thank you. Last time you wore a mustache, didn't you? Yes, you're right. I had one, but I cut it off. When I read the papers, I got scared and cut it off. But your car... isn't it blue? It's blue because I had it painted. But it's actually grey, just like it's described in the papers. Yes, I know, Mr. Commissioner, I know. I did a lot of stupid things. One after the other. I should have turned him in right away. Right away. But you know how it is. Someone mentions your work, your family. Then the papers write about it. Who knows what can happen? So the one who killed Poddu was professor Ranieri? Yes. He seemed so distinguished... - So... - So you've met professor Ranieri again? You met the professor again? No, judging from the pictures in the papers, he looks like a respectable man... So it was him. Τhe good professor Ranieri, huh? Can you imagine? I don't know, people can be so... Look, I'll tell you the truth: I tried to intervene... ... but then I got scared and ran off. But what could I have done? Τhe girl was already dead. What could I have done? Well, now you know the truth. I've done my duty. Mr. Commissioner, if there's nothing else, I... ... you know, I have to work. And in two hours, I have to... - I'm always at your disposal... - Just a little patience. - You'll have to sign a statement. - Yes, please. No problem. - Five minutes and we're done. - Please, go ahead. - Go ahead. - Officer, keep him company. Very well. Please. - Excuse me, can I make a call? - No, sorry. - Real quick. - It's only for internal calls. I wanted to call my wife. She's been waiting for me for one hour. - She might be worried, right? - No. No, you can't. Come, Mr. Santamaria. It's all ready. We can go now. - But don't I have to sign the testimony? - Yes, we'll do this at headquarters. - Don't worry. - Ah, yes, yes! But why at headquarters? Homicide is their responsibility. - Sir, you won't make me late for work? - No, no, don't worry. - We'll take care of it. - Yes, please. My boss is very fussy. - I'll follow you in my car. - No, come with us. Come here. We'll get there faster in this one. Salvatore, take care of that one. Τhey all get out the way, huh? When you drive around Rome with sirens wailing... ... it's a piece of cake, right? Imagine this, sir: From my home it takes me an hour and 20 minutes to get to the office. One hour and 20 minutes! I swear! I usually take off at 7 a.m., but when I leave at 7:10 a.m., I'm stranded. I'll never get there. Sure, I have an old car. Τhis one is nice. What's the engine size? - 2,000. - Holy moly! Thank you. - Hello, Mr. Commissioner. - Hello. - Τhis is Santamaria. - Hello. Please excuse me. He didn't even go to the office. It's almost 2 p.m. What could have happened? Nothing. Perhaps his car broke down. - He could at least call me. - Don't worry, he'll be home in a minute. Did you fight again? No, on the contrary. We went out on Sunday, and he was so kind. And so, Mr. Fabio, you thought it was wiser to get rid of your red checkered shirt. Yes, I know, but like I said to commissioner Pace... ... I was so scared, and anyone would have done the same, right? Not quite anyone. What paper do you read? "Gazzetta Sera". On Mondays I get "Italia Sport". - Right. Then you will have read this too. - What? Τhe article highlighted in red, "Suggestion for a TV thriller". - From what day? - Yesterday. No, I haven't read it. You read the "Gazzetta Sera" every day... ... but yesterday, of all days, you didn't buy it. - You know what it says? - No, what does it say? Τhat professor Ranieri could have also been the killer. Sir, he is the killer. I saw him, I was there. Very close. - Sure, sure... - Would you come with me, please? I'm coming. Thank you. Done? Thank you. - Τhat photo... why do you need it? - We need it, we need it. - Your left hand. - But these are fingerprints! Don't make a fuss. - I'm not making a fuss, I just... - Keep still for moment! Look at it, sir, a perfect match. Identical to the ones on the sunglasses. Good. - Anything else, sir? - No, thanks. Why did they bring him here? - What has he done? - I know as much as you do. - Can't I talk to him for a moment? - No, that's impossible. It's nothing, you'll see. It's him, the one in the middle. I saw him clearly. Τhere he is. I don't know, I honestly don't want to make a mistake... ... but I saw him a couple times at the recreational club for railway workers. Please. I'm sorry, professor, but I had to do it. I told them everything. Yes, that's him. He's the killer. What does that mean, "It's him"? No, no, excuse me. Who, "him"? But he... No, no, let go of me. Let go of me. Who, "him"? Who, "him"? Who? Who, "him"? Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Where are you taking me? What are you doing? Don't believe that guy. I have never killed anyone! I have never robbed, I have never hurt anyone! Sergeant, I'm innocent! Don't trust that guy! Yes, sure, sure. Sergeant, where are you taking me? What the hell are you doing? CORRECTIONAL FACILITY Gentlemen, the patient investigation carried out by myself and my colleagues... ... has been crowned with success. Τhe evidences and testimonies against Santamaria... ... are on their way to the magistrate at this very moment. We can consider the case as happily resolved. That's what you say... But what patient investigation, sergeant, if you allow? - You're still a sergeant? - Yes. - He turned himself in. - Of course, he had no way out. Τhere are two options, my dear sergeant. Either he's the killer, and I take my hat off to you... -... or he's just a poor crazy guy. - Τhen he's a crazy killer. - What do you want from me? - It's not that easy, sergeant... ... because if he's a crazy killer... SADISTIC KILLER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE SADISTIC GRASCIANO KILLER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE Please excuse the question, madam, but what was your intimate life like? I mean, your conjugal life, was it normal? Yes, it was normal, I'd say. Perfectly normal. Did your husband ever ask you for anything strange, different? No, my husband has always respected me. - I understand. - He's always been kind to me. So you were looking for, let's call it, "sexual freedom" outside the home... ... that out of respect for your wife, you didn't ask her to do. Sorry, I didn't understand. White, light grey... I was too far away. - What type of car was it? - A Mini Morris. - Come on, we're men, right? - Yes, we are men. Well, is that a crime? But sometimes, due to some fantasies, somebody... Somebody who? I didn't do anything. I told you 200 times. A light grey Mini Morris. He jumped a red light like a madman. - But did you know her? - Yes... No. - Yes or no? - I've never seen her before! - I saw her that day. - Then you knew her? Yes, whatever, I laid her... His shirt, and also his hands were covered in blood. - He was washing them. - What can I say? Do what you want! Listen, before I came here, I was scared shitless. Then someone talked to me about trust, and so I came here, because I'm innocent. Sure, he didn't look good that evening, but who would have thought... So do me a favor, I still have trust in you. Send me home, huh? So, why did you run when the police was chasing you? But when? What police? When he saw me, he immediately stopped. Blocking all the traffic. I noticed that he looked quite strange, but with all that traffic... Very well, Mr. Santamaria. Sign here. - Τhe usual statement, huh? - Come on, sign it. It's better for you. His father was an alcoholic, his aunt ran off with a German. If we believe the papers we're screwed. Even if it's true, how does this concern him? It does concern him. Follow the trial and you'll see. I don't believe it. Are you done? I could feel he had another woman... -... but I'm sure my husband... - Well, you felt it, but keep it to yourself... ... and convince him to tell the truth instead. He can't continue to ignore the evidence with this incredible, absurd stubbornness... ... and to accuse Ranieri. I'm his lawyer, he has to tell me the truth at least. If not, to be frank, he'll have to find another lawyer. I can't do this. 1859... - What does "sadist" mean? - Τhat's someone who kills whores. After the war of liberation... You're sure you saw that poor girl... ... your dead friend, I mean... ... get into a white car? Sure, I was right there. It was a 124. Darling, listen. You can't play with the lives of other people. Would you be willing to testify? You think I'm crazy? I already dealt with that kind of people, and I've had enough. I just want someone to pay for this. You're all pigs. Annare', what are you saying? We are talking about a life sentence. Actually, it's much worse because... ... the real life sentence doesn't exist anymore. But you can be imprisoned for 25 to 30 years, so do the math... Don Peppi'... When it's one of us, they always find a way to go unpunished. Besides, it was 10 in the morning. Wait... wait a moment. What time was it? 10 in the morning. Olga could have come back and then jumped into the other guy's Mini. Farewell, Don Peppi'. Bye, Annare'. - What's your name, honey? - Frankenstein. Oh, fuck off. Simona! No! Simona! - What has daddy done? - He hasn't done anything, honey. Anything. You'll see, daddy will be back soon. Daddy will be back soon. In the name of the Italian people... ... this court finds the accused Fabio Santamaria... ... guilty of the voluntary aggravated murder of Olga Poddu. Citing articles 575, 576 and 61, 1 and 4 of the penal code... ... I sentence him to 24 years of incarceration. Τhe court has ruled. Okay, Don Peppi', I'm going back to Rome. Shall we do a full page? Full page? For what? Ask the chief. - Think of your health. - Okay, Don Peppi'. Do you want a ride? No, I'll walk. You can go. - See you later. - Goodbye. Professor! What is it? Do you have a match? No. That's okay, doesn't matter. I'll see you at the appeal. Τhat poor guy can't be the killer, professor. Huh? Be seeing you.
