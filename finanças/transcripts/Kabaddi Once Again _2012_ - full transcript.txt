Ripped by gdhaliwal23 Preetam Kaur. So, you started acting like an elder sister-in-law. Why? What did I do? She got married just six months back.. ...and you have already asked her to cook. Come on, get up, girl. Don't burn your hands. Do one thing. You serve the flatbreads. Your sister-in-law will cook them. Why don't you say that you want your sister-in-law to serve you? Sister-in-law? No, no, no. She is just like my daughter Rano to me. Ranjit Singh is 10 years younger to me. | brought him up as my son. Look, father, Singhara ate all the butter in my plate. Here you go, my darling daughter. Have some more. Here you go. Okay? Look at him, aunt. Greedy. I will hit you. So what if I had some of yours? Singhara, act like a man. Father, I will be a man only if I eat butter. Wonderful. He will be a man and play Kabaddi like his uncle. Ranjit, can't you think of anything else other than Kabaddi? Sister-in-law, Kabaddi will change our lives now. We will build a mansion in the fields. And kitchen will be so fine.. ...that you and your sister-in-law will love it. And we will get a motorcycle to that Rano and Singhara will ride it. What happened? Did you find any treasure? Brother, your brother is going to England. To play Kabaddi. England? - England! Then you will be traveling in a plane, uncle. Right. Bless you, my boy. Ranjit, you already rule this area. Now, you go to England and rule the Englishmen as well. Brother, not just Englishmen but Englishwomen as well. What are you looking at? | feel like having a child. Go. Go have children with the Englishwomen. You haven't even reached England.. ...and you have already started dreaming about Englishwomen. Fool.. Englishmen don't play Kabaddi. And..l am a decent player. Be decent in England as well. Don't become a raider and embracer after seeing the Englishwomen. | embrace only one person. Listen.. Come soon. I won't like it here without you. My love, my teammates say, one can even.. ...break stones on my chest and it doesn't hurt. But your tears hurt me a lot. Fool, how will I survive abroad if you cry like this? These are tears of joy. Bless you. Bless you, my boy. Uncle, what will you get for me? Son, he will bring a bag full of pounds for you. Then you can even build a palace of gold. Brother, he is Mr. Bari. No one is a better Kabaddi commentator than him in the whole of Punjab. If he wants he can even make an average player embrace.. ...with his encouragement. Mr. Bari, | had heard a lot about you. But this is the first time I got a chance to meet you. Brother, I am getting a chance to play in England because of him. He is the one who referred me to the academy. Mr. Bari, thank you very much. You don't need to thank me. Ranijit is the best player of this area. I need your blessing, Mr. Bari. I will make our Kabaddi famous all over the world. Preetam Kaur. Quickly pack my meal. My fields are waiting for me. Let me feed her first. She is angry. She says it has been a month since Ranjit Singh left. He didn't send a single letter. Hear that. She is a fool. He wouldn't have time even to scratch his head. Exercising, playing the game. And then girl, you very well know.. ...he goes crazy when it comes to Kabaddi. This doesn't mean that he forgets the ones he left behind. If he didn't have the time to write a letter.. ...he could've at least called up at the confectioner's place. Don't worry. Everything must be fine there. People there take good care of the players. They carry them on their shoulders. Father. Father. Father. There is a car outside. Looks like uncle is back. Look, my brother-in-law is back. Now you can tell him all your complaints. Look at that. Look how crazy that girl is. She went barefoot. You go outside and stop him. I will pour some oil at the door and.. ...only then allow my brother-in-law to enter the house. - Okay. What happened? Why is everyone so sad? Deshrama, why are there tears in your eyes? What happened? Why don't you tell me? Mr. Bari, where is my Ranjit Singh? Why doesn't anyone tell me anything? Where is my brave boy? Have patience. Mr. Bari, I sent my brother with you. I want my brother back. What happened to him? He had a heart attack. Look, life and death are in God's hands. No one can do anything. You have to accept it as His will. This is God's will. Hello. Brother, he is Mr. Pal. The head of UK Kabaddi Federation. He is here especially from England to give his condolences for Ranjit. Players all over the world are sad on Ranjit's loss. We thought we should help his family after his loss. Mr. Bari must have told you everything else. Mr. Pal has brought a draft of 20,000 pounds.. ...on the behalf of the federation. Mr. Pal.. Please accept it. He was talking about building a big mansion when he was leaving. We will be able to build a mansion.. ...but he won't be able to have a look at it. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Father. You, too, will play Kabaddi? Father, What is my mistake? Scoundrel.. - Father. Father, don't. Mother. No, father. It has not been four days since your uncle passed away.. ...and you have already started playing Kabaddi. Have you lost your mind? - Yes, I have. Kabaddi killed my young brother. - Brother. Brother. - I will break your bones if I catch you playing Kabaddi. Brother. Children are a form of God. Even God doesn't apply His rules at this age. God! Don't cry, my brave boy. Your father is very nice at heart. Your uncle was very dear to your father. Because of Kabaddi your uncle.. He passed away. Don't cry, aunt. No matter what father says, I will surely.. ...be a Kabaddi player like uncle when I grow up. Bless you, my son. Do fulfill your uncle's dream. You play Kabaddi. I am with you. Did you hear? Did you hear what Singhara is saying? One day my son will win in England. Singhara will fulfill your dream. He will be the number one Kabaddi player in the world. Oh Lord, grant me this boon. May I never shirk from doing good deeds. Never may I fear when 1 go to fight the enemy. With surety, victory will be mine. Kabaddi is in our air. Kabaddi is in our salt. Kabaddi is in our soil. Kabaddi is in our blood. Kabaddi is in our air. Kabaddi is in our salt. Kabaddi is in our soil. Kabaddi is in our blood. Kabaddi is a sign of our colorful Punjab. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi is a sign of our colorful Punjab. Kabaddi is our pride. Kabaddi is our pride. Kabaddi is our honor. Kabaddi is our honor. Kabaddi. - Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. - Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi is our pride. Kabaddi is our honor. Kabaddi. - Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. - Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. - Kabaddi. Small legs and big bed. My mother named me Sucha Singh, the Kabaddi coach for a reason. First of all, let me introduce myself. I am from the Sandhu clan and my name is Sucha. I am well-known in Shan-e-Punjab Kabaddi Federation. That means I am a coach. As you know our federation is selects the best players.. ...from all over the Punjab and has matches at international level. This year as well we are forming a new team of Kabaddi players. From the players who play in the college team.. ...we have to select such raiders and embracers.. ...who forget men they can even handle elephants. So, in true sense we want players.. ...who have the potential to become professional players. Then how did you like the strength of players, Mr. Sandhu? Well, principal, your team is very good. But this boy.. What is your name, boy? He is Singhara Singh. The pride of our team. Wow. He is a nice young man. Principal, now he won't just be your college team's pride.. ...but the pride of our country's Kabaddi. Son, I can see the future of Kabaddi in you. Thank you, sir. There was another boy.. Yes. This embracer is also very good. Who? Clutch? His name is Clutch? - Yes. Strange. I have of clutches in cars. Are there clutches in Kabaddi as well? No. My name is Kirpal Singh. All the team players affectionately call me Clutch. Why do they call you so? I don't let the raider's car get into gear. | break in and embrace them. He is a very good embracer. Even thought he spends a year or two in every class. Sir, after all I am an embracer. | embrace the class as well. Principal, | have selected these two players. Aunt, where is father? He has gone to the fields. Aunt. - You look very happy. Son, at least tell me what happened. Aunt, there is good news. I don't know how to tell you. Guess it. What else can make you happy other than Kabaddi? | am sure you must have won a match. The match will take place now, mother. | got selected in Shan-e-Punjab Kabaddi Federation team. Congratulations, sister. You are the one who deserves to be congratulated, sister. You are the one who brought him up to be a Kabaddi player. Mother, I will have to go to the federation.. ...after college for Kabaddi practice. I will get late. - Not a problem. | fear father might find out. - Really? I will tell father. | dare you to tell him. Mother, can't you get rid of her soon? She always threatens me with father's name. You will get hanged first. | am younger than you. I won't get hanged. I will get married, in a grand style. First I need to find a weirdo and get you out of the house. Mother, look, he always talks nonsense. You will get married to a weirdo. Singhara. You both are grown ups now. Still you fight like children. Father, I didn't do anything. She started it. Okay, I started it. Should I tell everything to father? Rano, your brother was just kidding. Rano, what happened? Father, he doesn't study in college. If he did then he wouldn't need tuitions. Tuitions? He was just saying, I will come late from college. I have to go for tuitions. If one pays attention in college, then he doesn't need tuitions. | wonder what keeps his mind occupied. Oh, yes. Father, I scored less in English. Okay, no problem. You can go for tuitions. But you have to clear the exams with good scores. Don't fight. - Okay, father. Rano.. Thanks, sister. I feel like patting your head today. Come on, Clutch Singh, now your car is in gear. First I will win the federation match. Then I will go to England. I will go there and earn pounds. And I will have a lot of cars. Strange. I am yet to buy a car and a horn is already honking. I am dead. You.. You? Oh, God. Kiran, you are still a law student and not a lawyer. First be a lawyer then have such accidents. Thank God I didn't get hurt. Fine, even if you would have got hurt.. ...it wasn't like your preparation for exams would've gone waste. You will anyway clear the exams by copying. Forget the exams. Thank God I didn't get hurt. Otherwise, you would have injured an international player. An international player? You played a few Kabaddi matches in college.. ...and you think you are an international player. Not a college match, I will go to England.. ...and win the international Kabaddi cup. Oh. Sir, stop daydreaming. UK isn't Ladowal where you can go whenever you want. You need a visa to go there. And for your kind information you can play in the internationals.. ...if you have played for Punjab's team. Strange. You think I am stupid. I agree I am not good in studies. But now I will scale great heights. Yesterday, Shan-e-Punjab Kabaddi Federation's coach.. ...was here to take our trial. Singhara and I got selected. Now we are professional players. Professionals. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. This is what we will do there. Really? - Yes. It's great news. Where is Singhara? When did I say | won't give a party? Let's go to the canteen. You can eat whatever you want. Whatever you want. We don't want a party in the college canteen. Fine. Then we will see when I have the money to go to a restaurant. Singhara, this is wrong. You will have to give us a party. - You are great. The occasion to celebrate is now how can the celebrations be postponed. Give them a party. You are great. Okay. Now you, too, are with them? You, too, go selected. First you give a party. Yes. -L.L. Why are you stammering like Shah Rukh Khan? You, too, will have to give us a party. Right, guys? - Yes. And the party will take place at the same place.. ...where I had given a treat for my birthday. Remember? Hill Garden Restaurant. We have got a chance. We will get together. We have got an opportunity. We will express our feelings. We have got a chance. We will get together. We have got an opportunity. We will express our feelings. The sleepless nights.. Burning the midnight oil studying.. The sleepless nights.. Burning the midnight oil studying.. It's a different story. | found a soul mate. Our different story.. My dreams are invaded by a stranger. My dreams are invaded by a stranger. Who comes in your dreams at night? Don't worry. I will tell you everything. Why are you so eager? Who comes in your dreams at night? Don't worry. I will tell you everything. Why are you so eager? Don't act too smart. My love is true like the True Lord. Your eyes are mischievous. It accepts I am in love. Your stubborn youth.. My dreams are invaded by a stranger. My dreams are invaded by a stranger. You keep chatting on the net till late in the night. | read my beloved's emails at night. You keep chatting on the net till late in the night. | read my beloved's emails at night. Tell me something about him. He is very handsome. Where does he stay? He dwells in my heart. She got ruined.. My dreams are invaded by a stranger. Who invades your dreams? My dreams are invaded by a stranger. Who invades your dreams? Who invades your dreams? My name is Harjeet Singh Tufaan. | am a raider. Very good. Remain seated and introduce yourself. I'm from Chokaraley. A raider. Lakha. Phasrampuria. An embracer. Madrasi. Bhalla. A raider. Bittu. Jaspalwanger. A raider. Faruk. Phasrampuria. An embracer. Bhupinder. Village Bhatinda. An embracer. Monu. Phasrampuria. A raider. Gurdesh. Desha. A raider. And he is Sukhnaina Singh. Satta. An embracer. Sir, this time I have got best players from all over Punjab. Mr. Sandhu, the boys from Khalsa college aren't here. | was wondering the same. - Khalsa college students are here. Late on the first day. This is bad. Sorry, sir. We got late in the college. Be punctual in future. Sir, the boy I was talking about. He is Clutch. My name is Kirpal Singh. Everyone affectionately calls me Clutch. I am an embracer. And I am Singhara Singh. We both study in the same college. We are from the same village. Sir, he doesn't even let a fly sit on his body. He will touch and go. Boy, show him your body. Wonderful. How big are your biceps? Sir, it must be at least as big as your thighs. And the most important thing is that he is educated. Usually Kabaddi players are bad in studies. Sir, I dream to be an international player. You surely will be one, my boy. Our team goes go play international cup every year. Sir, I want Singhara to be the captain of our team. So, boys, do you accept that? - We do. Fine, then. You have been introduced to each other. The practice begins from tomorrow. Everyone should be here on time. Singhara, you and Clutch get a NOC from your principal. Who is it? Guess who. A special friend. Yes, a special friend. But what is her name? Daughter of the sun, Kiran. Oh my. I will die. What an expression. Just a second. Just a second. Why do you look so sad? Mr. Sandhu asked me to get a NOC from the college. Come with me. We will go meet the principal. | went to him. Principal first wants to meet my father. They need parent's consent to give a NOC. Then Singhara, get your father tomorrow. Kiran, you don't know, if my father finds out.. ...that I play Kabaddi in college, he will stop my education. But why? Why? Actually, my uncle was a renowned Kabaddi player. He died of a heart attack while playing a match. I'm sorry. - Father is against Kabaddi since that day. But Singhara, this was just an accident. Kabaddi wasn't at fault. Who will reason that with father? All the other members of my family are with me. But it is very difficult to convince father. I know. This is a very big problem indeed. But don't you worry. We will think of a solution. Idea. Don't overact. You will get me killed. - Let's go. May I come in, sir? Yes. Come in. Hello. - Hello. Sir, he is Kirpal Singh, Clutch's father. You asked him to meet you. - Oh, yes. Have a seat. - Thank you. By the way, you look just like Clutch. Hear that. Clutch is my son. Who will I look like if not him? Uncle, he looks like you, and not the other way around. It's the same. Like father like son. The same. Clutch was telling me you want me to sign.. ...some papers for the federation or something. Yes. Sign here. What's written on it? It states that you don't have a problem.. ...if Clutch wishes to play outside college team. Hear that. What objection will I have? My boy is playing and not doing drugs. But there is a problem. I am illiterate. You can take my thumb print wherever you want. Here you go. Where should I do it? Over here. Over here? - Yes. Here you go. Clutch didn't come with you? Clutch? Well, he said, Father you will embarrass me by.. ...giving a thumb impression before the principal. That's why he didn't come. One more thing. Singhara's father had some important work in the market. He asked me to give a thumb impression for Singhara's papers as well. How is that possible? Without his approval.. What are you saying? I will get his approval right away. Just a minute. Talk to his father right away. I will.. Here you go. You said you are illiterate, but you use a mobile.. I am not that illiterate. Nowadays everyone knows 1, 2, 3. What are you saying? Hello? Preetam Kaur. It's me. Hello. Nachattar Singh is with you? I am in the college. He had told me to give my thumb impression.. ...on Singhara's documents as well. But the principal doesn't believe it. Singhara's father has forgotten his mobile at home. He forgot his mobile at home. Then do one thing. You talk to him, sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Here, talk to her. Hello. Well..well, who is this? This is Principal Amrik Singh Dhanva. Singhara's father is gone to the market. He forgot his mobile at home. Brother, you can make Clutch's father.. ...sign on any documents you want. Fine. Bye. - Okay, brother. Bye. Here you go. So, I can make a move? - Yes. Bye. - Bye. Let's go, son. Clutch. - Yes, sir? You act well. But son, I am your principal. Teachers are like parents. You shouldn't play such pranks with them. Sorry, sir. Both of you are our college's pride. And now you are going to make Kabaddi your profession. Best of luck. Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. Stupid make mistakes and God rectifies them. Who will praise Sandhu if there is anyone like him? I could do it while brushing my teeth. There is a reason why my mother named me.. Sucha Singh, the Kabaddi coach. Scoundrels, you are pulling my leg. You have learnt a lot of things. Things have become so easy for you. Your raid lasts only for 30 seconds. And you still make a fuss about it. During my time we had to loudly say Kabaddi, Kabaddi.. ...and we had to hold our breath as well. Federation has made a very good decision. But the raiders used to stealthily breathe earlier as well. What did you say? - What say, Tufaan? Tufaan? What do you mean? | breathe stealthily? - Why are you getting angry? | was just giving an example. You could have mentioned Singhara's name as well. Okay. - Stop joking and start practicing seriously. Rano. Rano, my child. Where is my baby? Yes, father? Dear, tell me, what do they call the English course.. ...one does when one has to go abroad? IELTS, father? Yes. That one. Should we enroll you for that? What course are you making her do? | was thinking.. ...of sending her abroad. | got a proposal. The boy is studying in England. He will get settled there in a year or so. He has only one condition. The girl should have given IELTS. How will she clear IELTS? She barely managed to clear high school. Really? I am more intelligent than you are. I didn't have to go for tuitions like you. Keep quiet or else | will tell father everything. They just need an excuse to fight. Singhara, you will miss Rano and cry once she gets married. I won't cry. Yes, I will have to wet my eyes with spit when she is leaving. Father, look at him. At least let me finish what I was saying. You are having an argument unnecessarily. You know Chand Singh, Phadowalia? Yes. - Yes. He has sent a proposal. Okay. - Okay. - Yes. | have enquired about the boy's family. Only fortunate ones get such families. Let's do one thing. Let's do their betrothal. When the boy settles down, we will get them married. Bachchan, your Deshu the confectioner is still blushing. Bite your tongue, sister-in-law. - Scoundrel. He still jokes with me. This is for the boy's family. Hi. How did the girl outgrow her clothes so quickly? How are you? - Fine. Come. - This is your house? It's so nice. - Thank you. She is very beautiful. - I can see that. Wow! It's beautiful. Hi! - Mother, she is Kiran. She studies with me in college. Hello. - Bless you, dear. And she is my aunt. Hello. - Bless you, dear. You are so beautiful. Thanks. And I am Singhara's sister. Okay, so it's your engagement. Congrats. Thanks. Why didn't you come here earlier? Actually, your brother didn't want me to come today as well. But I went against him and came. That too a day earlier. Actually, I have never seen a village function. I love village culture. You love..village culture? Rano, go. Go take Kiran inside and give her some refreshments. Okay, mother. Let's go, Kiran. - Okay. See ya. Sister.. | thought Singhara only knows how to play Kabaddi. Congratulations, everyone. Congratulations, Mr. Nachattar. You and he are now relatives. Nowadays it doesn't work well with relatives. We will treat each other like brothers. Rano, now we won't fight. Singhara, you are crying. Stupid, it is an occasion to celebrate. You don't know the village culture. This is a brother's love for his sister. I know. I know. Rano's in-laws are so nice. Aren't they? Okay. Just a second. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Sir, what is this? You should be giving me sweets. Instead, I am offering you sweets. But it's not a problem. I, too, will have some sweets. So good. Okay. Listen, now you don't need to cry. Smile. That's better. I'll get going. Okay? So, do you want to take the plunge as well? Don't make out the opposite meaning of everything. You didn't understand. She is here to see her in-laws' house. You go and do your work. You will behave like a raider all your life. Try being an embracer at times. She is raiding you in front of everyone. Get lost. Yes, Kiran. Clutch here. Brother Clutch, where is Singhara? I am a brother only to Singhara. Wait. Brother Singhara, call for you. Kiran's call. Tell her, I am thinking of making her my sister-in-law.. ...and she is calling me brother. Keep quiet. Hello? Yes, Kiran. Singhara, I think you have forgotten me. Why didn't you come to college for so many days? There is no reason to forget. We have a match next week. Our practice is in full swing. What is it? Do you want have some important work? There is. But I can't tell you over the phone. Come soon and meet me. Tell me, what is it? Stupid, you shouldn't ask that question to girls. Who was that? - Clutch. Listen, Singhara, don't get Clutch with you tomorrow. | want to meet you alone. Alone? But what is it? There is something important. You can assume that I'm going to take an important decision of my life. And you are my special friend. Meet me tomorrow at 10 at Hill Garden Restaurant.. Okay? Bye. Strange. She says.. She will wait for me at the Hill Garden Restaurant tomorrow at 10. I should come alone. Why does she want me to come alone? She must have decided to make you her brother. You are so naive. Listen up. Go there in style tomorrow. Use some perfume. The paths seem intoxicated today. My desires have got wings. The paths seem intoxicated today. My desires have got wings. In my precious heart.. In my precious heart.. | wish to dwell true love. Beat slower, oh my heart. Today, my dream is to come true. Beat slower, oh my heart. Today, my dream is to come true. My dream is to come true. Today, my dream is to come true. Today is the first meeting. That's why the nature smiles at me. Today is the first meeting. That's why the nature smiles at me. My beautiful beloved.. Defeats flowers with her charm. Today, looking at her beauty.. Looking at her beauty.. Even the sun will get tempted, Beat slower, oh my heart. Today, my dream is to come true. Beat slower, oh my heart. Today, my dream is to come true. My dream is to come true. Today, my dream is to come true. I am Ranjha and you are my Heer. In your eyes lies my image. I am Ranjha and you are my Heer. In your eyes lies my image. A beautiful moon loves a firefly. | am so fortunate. My heart desires to soar high. My heart desires to soar high. And touch the sky. Beat slower, oh my heart. Today, my dream is to come true. Beat slower, oh my heart. Today, my dream is to come true. My dream is to come true. Today, my dream is to come true. Where is he? Singhara. Thank God you came. | was waiting for you. Come. - You called me and I don't show up. How it that possible? Yes. Come. So, tell me, what will you have? Later. First tell me what is it? Have patience. Have patience. I will tell you everything. It is good news. But before that let's order something. Coffee? - Fine. Waiter. - Yes, ma'am. Two cups of special coffee. - Okay, ma'am. You are keeping me in suspense. Tell me what is it? And why do you keep looking over there? Is someone supposed to come? Not has to, he is here. Hi. Hi. Who is he? My boyfriend, Sandeep. Come. Hi, Kiran. Hi. Looking great. - Thanks. Sandeep, he is my best friend, Singhara. How are you, Singhara? - Fine. Kiran praises you a lot. She said she wants to introduce me to you.. ...before we get engaged. Engagement? - Yes. We are very soon going to get engaged. Singhara, do you know, he too is a sportsman. Singhara didn't ask which game do I play. No matter what game you play, you have won. He plays cricket. You know he has played for the Ranjit Trophy. And soon I will play for Team India. Best of luck. Thanks. Singhara, shall I say something? You, too, should play a game which has loads of money in it. | mean, Kabaddi is a poor man's game. Kiran, Kabaddi is no longer a poor man's game. Millions ride on raiders. But Singhara, there is a vast difference in cricket and Kabaddi. Cricket players are stars. It is not so. There is fame in Kabaddi as well. Balwinder Findhu. Harjeet Bajekhanna. Such men are very rare. Kabaddi is our game. - I mean.. Money, fame and status. Only cricket can give you that. Yes, man. Photos of your players can be seen only in village sports fairs. But cricket stars like Dhoni and Sachin get big hoardings. Did Kabaddi players ever make it to the hoarding? Cricketers are so rich. So rich. They are stars. The make billions in ads. Not a problem, Kiran. There will be a time when Kabaddi will get its due. My dream was shattered. My life got drowned in tears. My dream was shattered. My life got drowned in tears. | could build no palace in love. My heart was shattered. The burden of sorrows.. This burden of sorrows, I have to carry unwillingly. This is my first heartbreak. It's a sorrow of lifetime. This is my first heartbreak. It's a sorrow of lifetime. Brother.. What happened? Didn't she meet you? She did. But she loves someone else.. | used to love only Kabaddi. What have you gotten me into? This world only looks at money. Only money. No one values love nowadays. She loves a cricket player. This cricket defeated us here as well? I am not sad because she loves someone else. | am sad because she disgraced Kabaddi. She said Kabaddi is village game. A poor man's game. Cricket players get big hoardings. Come what may, Clutch.. .Now I will be a Kabaddi star and show it to her. A star. We will make Kabaddi famous in the world. No matter what sacrifice I have to make for it. The boy touched the ground and folded his hands. Look, he is praying to God, people. Applaud everyone. Encourage him. Singhara Singh is going for a raid, people. Touch the one you like. Touch him, Singhara Singh. Well done. Let's see who he touches. Embracers are onto him. They are wrestling. Let's see. Let's see who scores. This is called the clash of titans. They accused each other and fought. People say that friendship with a wanderer is of no use. Well done, my buddy. There he goes. Singhara is a lion. Shan-e-Punjab's team has scored its first point of the match. Singhara's responsible for it. There he goes. He's Kamalveer. Back off. Back off. - A player of Dashmesh Academy. From village Patarkala, Jalandar district. Let's see whom he touches. | am so pleased. | can see the youth at its best. That's a reverse drop. That's Clutch. He is incomparable. They have locked each other. Let's see. The line is far away. Pull, young man. Pull. Pull him closer, my buddy. That's Kirpal, Clutch. -Yes. Team Shan-e-Punjab's embracer. Moga. Desha is making a move. A young playing of Shan-e-Punjab, on a raid. Well toned thighs. Tall and well-built. | have welcomed everyone as family. Let's see whom he takes for a round. Whom he touches. They are wrestling. That's Phulowalia's Shinda. Their hands are on each other. The arms have locked him. Let's see what he does. The hand is strained. He is dragging him. Desha is incomparable. - Very good. That's what is called a top class player. - Go for it. He is dragging him. Everyone is watching them. There he puts his hand on the line. Shan-e-Punjab scores another point. Geeta goes on a raid. - Be strong, Clutch. He taps his thigh and prepares to wrestle an embracer. He is firework. He is fast and smart. Quick-pacer. He touched the dress. There was chaos. He touched the hand. Hands are like flying shakes. They move fast. Satta didn't even come to know. He crossed the line. - Oh no. Geeta scored. Satta didn't even come to know.. ...when Geeta took him on the other side and scored. | had told you to put your hand underneath. I didn't come to know. Singhara Singh is once again going on a raid.

He is bleeding. Patarkalawa scored the point for Dashmesh Academy. And with that the referee signals half time. Dashmesh Academy has scored 19 points and Shan-e-Punjab has scored 22 points. After the half time the match between the two teams.. ...is about to begin once again. Okay. Go for it, Singhara. Singhara Singh is going for his first raid in the second half. He milked cows. He built body working hard. He toiled. Why take drugs. You get ruined. Say no to it. It's doorway to hell. They have gathered. The churning has started. One, two, three and four. Touch the one you like. Come on. Singhara Singh still hasn't touched anyone. Let's see if gets caught. It will be troublesome. Well done. You are incomparable. There he hits him. He goes straight out of the field. The embracers are staring at him. Hats off to Singhara who.. I think they are fighting. Separate them. Coaches need to come and talk some sense into them. This is no Kabaddi. Play Kabaddi. Show love. Play Kabaddi as Kabaddi. Son, what's wrong with you? This is not how you are to play this game. Singhara Singh, you are this team's captain. If you play like this, what will others do? You are shown the yellow card and benched for five minutes. You should play Kabaddi with the feeling of love. No one will be spared you if you play fouls like this. Not even the captain of the team. There goes the boy from Mulewali. He is Gurjeet Geeta. Tall and well-built boy. He has entered the opponent's side. -Come on. There he churns. Let's see what he says. You are incomparable. Satnam, Satta, is going for him. He says I will go. He says, I won't let you go. Pull. - Both of them are wrestling each other. There he pushes him out. He has taken back the points he had given. - Well done, Satta. Go. - Balbir Bittu is going for it.

Let's see who the referee gives the point to. It's common. Singhara is angry. Even though his team is winning the match, the score is 32-57. Still he doesn't want them to score. Here Singhara is going for the last raid. Singhara Singh from team Shan-e-Punjab. Let's see what he does. This is the last Kabaddi of this match. Hats off to you. You are incomparable. Gigantic thighs. There one grabs him. He throws him out of the ground, at the feet of the audience. With this point from Singhara Shan-e-Punjab Kabaddi federation.. ...have scored 58 against their opponent.. ...Dashmesh Academy's 32 and won. Very good. After a long time I've seen a player like you in the world of Kabaddi. Singhara Singh, from which village are you? Gujjaral. So you are from Ranjit Singh's village. 15 years back Ranjit Singh ruled the Kabaddi world. I am his nephew, Mr. Bari. That's why you play so well. Your uncle used to throw the embracers like.. ...one removes a shawl. No one can go against the will of God. Singhara Singh, I was the commentator of that match as well.. ...in which your uncle had passed away. Mr. Bari, I very well remember it. | was 10 years old when you had come home for uncle. Singhara Singh, then, I am like an uncle to you. Whenever you need anything, take me to be your uncle and tell me. Okay? - Thank you, uncle. Friends, Shan-e-Punjab Kabaddi federation's head.. ...wishes to make a special announcement. The team which won the Shan-e-Punjab Kabaddi federation's.. ...final match will go to play Kabaddi world cup in England. Now, I would request the winning captain, Singhara Singh.. ...to come on the stage and receive the cup.. ...from the head of the north India Kabaddi Federation.. ...Mr. Surjan Singh Chattha. Hello. Yes. Blessed are those.. Who take the name of Lord. I had said.. .That no one in this family will play Kabaddi. Today, I have found out that you are also supporting him. The entire family kept me in the dark all these years. But, father.. - Beware if you call me father. With an excuse of tuition you stealthily play Kabaddi. | only play Kabaddi, it's not like I am into drugs. Bur why are you against to kabaddi. My uncle Ranjit Singh, too, used to play Kabaddi. This huge mansion is built with the money from that Kabaddi. This huge mansion is something I can burn. Someone just get my brother back who was like a son to me. This mansion isn't built with the money from Kabaddi. It is built on your uncle's dead body. His dead body. Look.. Look at this woman. Kabaddi made her a widow at a tender age. And you, scoundrel, you forgot your uncle's death. You are playing Kabaddi? Life and death is in God's hands, father. What's Kabaddi's fault in this? Son, it's not Kabaddi's fault, but the ones.. ...who have turned in it into a business. They give them different types of drugs to win the match. They give them injections. They make millions of dollars. And players like you have to face death. You are just a puppet which is being handled by them. They had given your uncle drugs. So that Ranjit Singh can risk his life and win the match. And those scoundrels can fill their pockets with dollars. What are you saying, brother? Yes. You don't know the truth. They had asked the doctor to make a false report. That.. That Ranjit Singh had a heart attack. It wasn't so. The truth was something else. 'Mr. Bari, you tell me the truth. 'Nachattar Singh, those who invests millions in Kabaddi..' '..can do anything to win a match.' 'They gave Ranjit drugs so that he would play well. 'Drug? - What is that?' 'It is a narcotic. "The one who has it gets loads of strength. "But the one who has the drugs doesn't live for long.' 'Why should that bother him?* 'They are concerned only with winning the match. 'If one player dies another will come.' 'They gave Ranjit an overdose of drugs.' 'He died on the ground while playing. Kabaddi killed my brother. They didn't give us 50,000 pounds to help us. They had given it to keep us quiet. Son, now do you know how this mansion was built? But what should I do, father? Kabaddi is in my blood and in every breath I take. Just like my uncle. Kabaddi is my life, father. One day this Kabaddi will take your life. Son, what if something happens to you? What are you saying? And then brother, everyone is not the same. Girl, it's not written on anyone's forehead that he is good or bad. Look at me, brother. | spent all these years alone. Only with his memories. When Singhara used to play Kabaddi when he was young.. .| felt as if my husband's soul has come into his body. And today, when Singhara won the cup.. .| felt as if his soul has got some peace. He wanted to be the best player in the world. But life didn't support him. But now let Singhara fulfill his dream, brother. Fine. He is a young man now. | can't even raise my hand on him. He can do whatever he pleases. But I am against his playing Kabaddi. It's okay, son. One day your father will support you. Don't lose hope. Don't worry, aunt. One day I will surely fulfill my uncle's dream. Yes, so have you reached? So you are drinking at the junction. My mother wanted her son to be tall. And my father wanted his son to be short. That's it. This is what caused the trouble. | solved their problem by naming myself Nikka Singh Lamting. What is it? You didn't find it funny? Funny? You are feeling like laughing? We are feeling like crying. My father's and my shoes have worn out visiting your office. What are you saying, Jaili? I have sent half of Punjab to UK. You can go and enquire anywhere in the market.. ...the one who enters Nikka Singh Lamting's office.. ...enters the plane to UK. Well, such work can be delayed a little at times. A little? It has been a year since we gave you Rs. 5 lakhs. You can calculate the interest on Rs. 5 lakh for a year. Sir, talk sensibility. Be farsighted. When your son goes to UK he will gather pounds with both hands. Your money is with Lamting. You can think that it's in a bank. Yes, if you don't trust me then you can come tomorrow.. ...and take your money back. When you have sent so many people when isn't my turn coming? Your turn got overturned. The thing is, earlier we sent boys with singers. As musicians. Then I sent them as film crew. Slowly the embassy realized and this business stopped. How will you send me there? All the options have ceased to exist. My name is Lamting. If one option ends, | make 20 other options. Next month there is going to be a world cup of Kabaddi. Look, I mentioned Kabaddi and Mr. Sandhu came. Lamting calls me and I won't come? How is that possible? Great. Wonderful. He is Mr. Sucha Singh Sandhu. He is a known Kabaddi coach. - Greetings. He will do your job. Leave. I'll see you tomorrow. Consider your job done. Mr. Lamting, what are doing with these boys? Mr. Sandhu, today, | footed the bill on your name. On me? I am no visa officer. No. You are an officer of opportunity. There is news being published in the newspaper every day. Sucha Singh Sandhu is taking the Kabaddi team for the world cup. | say, take a few of my players as well. Take them with me? Are they undergarments.. ...which I can keep in my luggage? You know how strict the embassy is nowadays? Sir, they are strict for other and not thugs like us. And then Sandhu can hit his heel on the floor and spring water. There is a reason his mother named him Sucha Singh, the Kabaddi coach. Mr. Lamting, you can do whatever you please.. ...but don't try to flatter Sandhu. Never even by mistake try that. Why don't you just say that the old rates won't do? Who doesn't like money? But the immigration doesn't let me leave Delhi.. ...without taking something. You don't worry about that. We will take a flight from Amritsar. I have contacts there. There is another problem. The list of players has been finalized. Drop three players. What difference does it make? It doesn't make a difference to me. Promoter. Committee. Committee isn't separate from you. Listen to me. Rs. 10 lakhs per person. It doesn't matter how much I make. Rs. 10 lakhs won't do. I will take at least Rs. 20 lakhs. Not everyone is honest like Sandhu. I will have to bribe the promoters as well. What is the reason behind changing three players of the team? | don't get it, sir. Son, you should concentrate on your game. You don't have a right to interfere in committee's decision. Why don't I have the right? | am the captain of the team. And who made you the captain? If we lose the match, you will blame me. How will you lose the match? The committee has included the new players after due thought. Where were these players earlier? I have never seen their faces. I have never practiced with them. How can we play a match with them? You don't have to play a match as soon as you reach UK. We will give you a few days there to practice. So, you don't worry. They, too, are professional players. What is wrong with the players we had earlier? Satta and Clutch are very good embracers. Tufaan is a great raider. What problem does the committee has to take them to UK? Don't you glare at me. I cannot do anything. This is the committee's decision. Fine, then. Here's my decision. None of us will go to UK until you bring those three players back. What happened? - Don't worry. I clearly told Sandhu that all of us will go together.. ...otherwise none of us with go. Look, money can change anyone's mind. Give him a share. Brother, keep your advice to yourself. Don't create a new problem for me. If he comes to know that we are taking illegal immigrants with us.. ...then he will never agree. He is a true player. I, too, am a player. Do one thing. Drop some other player in place of Clutch. Tell Singhara that his whole team is going. Our men are going as extras. We will submit the tickets and passports at the last moment. And what if he creates a scene at the airport? All of us will get arrested. What is Lamting here for? We will first send Singhara in. And we will send Clutch last. Singhara, sitting on the plane won't come to know.. ...who came and who didn't. Be careful, brother. Otherwise instead of a plane, we will be in a police van. My mother very proudly named me.. ...Sucha Singh, the Kabaddi coach. Here, I ward off evil with these chilies. | hope no one casts an evil eye on you. This is the first time I am seeing such determination on your face. It looks like you are going to fight a battle. My brother is going to win a battle. Brother, what will you get for me? - Don't worry. I will surely get a winter coat for your mother-in-law. Okay. You are already concerned about her mother-in-law. And what will you get for your mothers? Mothers? Pride and honor, aunt. Saw? My son said such a nice thing. Go, son. Touch your father's feet and seek his blessings. Even if parents are angry with their children.. ...they always think of their wellbeing. Go, son. - Okay, mother. Father. Brother, he is going abroad for the first time. You shouldn't cause an ill-omen. Bless him and send him off. Father. Singhara, let me introduce you to your new mates. He is Dheera. A raider. They are Jaila and Phinda. Both of them are embracers. They are going as extras. | mean as spare players. Okay, Mr. Sandhu. I have no objection with them coming with us. But my entire team should go. Your whole team will go, sir. Why are you troubling me? You know how | convinced the promoter? | have to convince so many people. Do you know what does three people going as extra means? A loss of Rs. 3 lakhs. Can we do inside, sir? What is it? Is there a storm coming? Have patience. We'll go inside soon. You won't stay behind now. First let Lamting come. He has everyone's passports and tickets. Look, Mr. Lamting is here. Mr. Sandhu, India's system is rotten. That is why I am slowly sending everyone out. Mr. Sandhu. - Come, Mr. Lamting. I was waiting for you. Why did you have to wait? Airline's system was down. | used my contacts. You know my name is Nikka Singh Lamting. | managed to get their documents. Okay, boys. When I will take your name.. ...take your tickets, go inside and check-in. You will see beautiful air hostesses inside. You can show your ticket to them. Careful. Don't start embracing as soon as you go. Here you go, Singhara. Go and play Kabaddi. Me too. - Dheera. Here you go. Jaila. Take it. - Hurry up. Take it, Phinda. You, too, play Kabaddi. You got the visa. Move aside. I didn't get a visa, only you did. Go. Here. You can wear the goggles inside. Come on, sir. Come on. That leaves five of us here. Here's your passport. Brother, my ticket? Say that you have a pass. A pass? Here's your ticket. You won't stop asking. Go inside and tell your name is Kirpal Singh. Don't say Clutch. Clutch. And give Singhara a message. Tell him that the three boys who didn't come.. ...will come tomorrow with Mr. Sandhu. We couldn't arrange for four tickets. Mr. Sandhu is also not coming? But then we will have problem over there. We can't even talk in English properly. Why do you need to know English? You aren't going to a SAARC's meeting. You only have to go there and play Kabaddi. Don't worry. The promoter's coordinator will be there at the airport to pick you up. Now what are you staring at? Leave. Leave. If the seats get occupied you will have to go standing. Sir. - Mr. Sandhu. Who Mr. Sandhu? Sandhu can make the impossible possible. There is a reason mother named me Sucha Singh, the Kabaddi coach. Mr. Sandhu. -Yes? So you saw Lamting's act? I made the three of them catch the flight. You made them fly. Singhara, you deceived your friends. This is heaven. Listen, Singhara. Take everyone's passports. What will I do with them? - Try to understand. Listen up. Mr. Sandhu had said everyone should.. ...give their passports to brother once you reach here. He didn't tell us. He would tell so to everyone? I was the last one to come. He told me. Fine. We will hand it over to him if he said so. Here you go. Give me your passport. - Here's mine. - Here you go. Come on. Everyone give it. - Here, take it. - Give it. Give it to me. Here you go. - Here, take it. Here. Take it. Here you go, brother. Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. - Come on. Hello. Hello. Hello. - Welcome to UK, brother. Thanks. - How are you? Was your journey fine? We have reached safe and sound, but who are you? Well, my name is Jackie. Careful. He might grab me. You are very jolly, brother. Not Jolly, my name is Clutch. Very funny. Very funny. Anyway, I am here to receive all of you. Let's go. - Let's go. -Come on. Come on, brother. Come. This is your house. Consider it as your home. We are making you stay here. No one should feel shy, you know. Ask me if you need anything. Don't shy. This whole house is ours. This is a nice house, isn't it? All of you will be staying here. He is our brother. Welcome, boys. Did everyone have a safe journey? -Yes... | am your promoter. Pal. Hello. - Hello. Hello. Hello. I am Singhara Singh, sir. This team's captain. Yes, Mr. Sandhu was praising you. You are a very tough player. I am Clutch. An embracer. Did he say anything about me? Nice to meet you. | feel England is a strange place. From the time I have come here, I can't hear anything. Brother, I feel you have jetlag. What is that, brother? - I will explain. Brother, when we fly continuously for 10-12 hours.. ...we suffer from blocked ears. That is called jetlag. Do one thing. Freshen up and rest a little. We rested on our way. We will freshen up and practice. Brother Jackie, how far is the ground? What is the hurry? You have come to UK for the first time. Do a little sight seeing. And let Mr. Sandhu come. Jackie.. - Yes, brother? Show the boys a good time. Okay, brother. Alright. Her eyes should be intoxicating. She should be a budding rose. Her gait should be mesmerizing. She should know how to dance. She should be beautiful. She should be slim. She should know how to dance. Her eyes should be intoxicating. She should be a budding rose. Her gait should be mesmerizing. She should know how to dance. She should be beautiful. She should be slim. She should know how to dance. I want to fall in love. I will if I find such a girl. I want to fall in love. I will if I find such a girl. You are crazy about me. | am crazy about you. You are crazy about me. | am crazy about you. She should directly target my heart and win it. When we look into each other's eyes, I should get a high. She should directly target my heart and win it. When we look into each other's eyes, I should get a high. She should be an angel. There should be some magic. I want love. She should know how to dance. She should be beautiful. She should be slim. She should know how to dance. I want to fall in love. I will if I find such a girl. I want to fall in love. I will if I find such a girl. She should be very fair. She should be like a gem. She should have a special glow on her face. She should be very fair. She should be like a gem.

Fatso, you are still kneading the dough. When will you make the flatbreads? I will make the flatbreads. - Don't get irritated. Make the flatbreads. Hurry up. - I am making them. I am making them. He is getting irritated. You are acting like a singer. Who will wash the utensils? Wash the utensils? Me? I won't wash the utensils. - Quietly wash the utensils. You have come here through illicit means. Forget the utensils, you will even have to clean the washrooms. Look what he is saying. Look how he is staring at me. You...! - Hurry up. This is a limit. He is having fun and he is making us do all the work. Have you lost your mind? Have you lost your mind? No one will say anything till the match. Hey fatso, come here. My name is Dheera. - I know, brother. Come here. You are a raider? - Yes. Let me see how you raid. Go there. You be the embracer. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Well done. Move your leg. Lazybones, you cannot even move. A raider needs to be energetic. A good embracer will kill you. How are you, boys? Look, Mr. Sandhu is here. - I am free now. So your practice is going on fine? Very good. Very good. Very good. This is good. He doesn't know to play. He plays badly. Forget that. Tell me, did you see the white dolls? | mean the Englishwomen. Mr. Sandhu, what is this? You are alone. Where are Satta and others? Well, actually, there is a problem with their documents. But Lamting had said that he didn't get tickets. He spoke like a true travel agent. We found out the truth later. We have found out the truth now, Mr. Sandhu. Why are you fooling us? | know what you are doing under the pretext of Kabaddi. What do you know? What do you know? Don't you know how to speak to your coach? You came to UK yesterday and you already have grown wings. You are arguing with me? Not even my father raised his voice on me. My mother named me Sucha Singh, the Kabaddi coach for a reason. Brother. Forget it, brother. Let bygones be bygones. Come on, let's practice. I am with you. Hi, Sandhu. Welcome. Welcome, Mr. Pal. Welcome. Welcome. How are you, Mr. Sandhu? - Very well. Your team is very famous in UK. We have come to UK because we are famous. Otherwise we would have returned from Loduwal. I thought of having a look at the practice. - Oh, sure. Why not? Come on, boys. Very good. Begin. Quick. Quick. You come over here. Lift your feet. Mr. Sandhu, listen up. -Yes? You are invited to my house in the evening. Thank you for your hospitality. One more thing. Do get the captain Singhara with me. We will have some drinks together. Sir, Mr. Sandhu is here to meet you. Send him. Okay, sir. Yes, please come. Give it to me. Very good. Come, Mr. Sandhu. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you, sir. How are you? - Fine, sir. Have a seat. First of all tell me, what will you have. Whiskey or beer? - I don't drink, sir. Mr. Pal, don't listen to him. Give me the beer. And give him milk with some tea leaves in it. No thanks. Look Mr. Sandhu, millions of pounds are riding on your team. And Pal never plays to lose. You have to lose this match. Mr. Pal, how will we benefit from this loss? You won't get this much money even after winning the match. Oh, my God. Mr. Pal, don't worry. Consider that we have lost. How did we lose, Mr. Sandhu? Kabaddi is the game of our land. And we can never strike such a deal. When you are getting so much money to lose.. ...then why do you want to break your bones to win? Hats off..to you dealers of Kabaddi. My father was right. You aren't the promoter of Kabaddi. You are a businessman. And coaches like Sandhu are your brokers. You don't promote Kabaddi. You just fix matches and make money. And your grounds aren't Kabaddi grounds. They are smuggling dens. Where, to win matches players are given drugs. My uncle Ranjit died because of men like you. Mr. Pal, I am here to win. And I will win. Hey, you will win, only if you stay alive. Like Ranjit, only your dead body will return. You.. - No. Son. You go and sit in the car. You go and sit in the car. Come on. Come on, leave. Mr. Pal, are you crazy? Cool down. Cool down. Bloody fool. He refused such a big deal. Mr. Sandhu, I have millions riding on this match. If he doesn't lose, I will kill him. I will kill him. I will kill him. I will kill him. - Cool down. Cool down, Mr. Pal. Everything will be fine. Why is Sandhu here for? | agree the money won't go with me when I die.. ...but Sandhu is such a scoundrel that he won't leave it here. They aren't sponsors of Kabaddi. They are bloody brokers. They have turned Kabaddi into a business. They make deal from top to bottom. To win, to lose. To bring teams over here. And to bring outsiders with the team. Will we win the matches with those three outsiders? Not a problem. I knew this in Amritsar itself. Why are you feeling so angry? Brother, we will win. How will we win? When the sponsor and the coach doesn't want us to win. What did you say? The coach doesn't want us to win? Those bookies bought him. The sponsors say there is a lot of money riding on our team. They will lose a lot of money if we win. Bookies, sponsor, coach. All of them are together in it. Our captain hasn't sold himself. By God, we will do it. Have faith in God, brother. Tomorrow, we will get down on the Kabaddi ground to win. Very nice. Good luck. First surround them and then grab them. Come on, meet them. - Very good. How are you? Are you ready? Fine. As long as I am here, don't do anything to create a scene. Do as I say. - How are you? - Fine. Got it? - Are your men trained? -Yes. All the best. - Fine. You will have to play to win this match. What happened? Couldn't you strike a deal with Singhara? The bastard didn't agree. He is a bloody real sportsman. Mr. Pal, why worry when Sandhu is here? Sandhu can even debone a boneless chicken. There is a reason my mother named me Sucha Singh, the Kabaddi coach. So, don't worry. Whatever Mr. Pal wants will happen. They will get dragged and bruised. When will our extras come of use? The TT of Kabaddi has blown the whistle. And the first match of the World Cup begins. - Come on. Come on. The first match is between India and Canada. - Come on. Come on. Shinda from Canada has taken the blessing and is on the ground. A player from Canada. He has come for a raid. Let's see who gets the point. Here Clutch has got hold of him. He is trying to realize his hand. He has embraced him. He has thrown Clutch away. He has turned Clutch's car. Clutch has turned on his heel. He returned and once again embraced him. Hold him. Hold him. - Clutch looks slim but his bones are strong. He won't let go of the point. What do we see here? Point is given to India's team. They are dancing. Captain Singhara Singh gave a tap to Bittu. Audience gave this young man a grand welcome. His body is chiseled into shape. Singhara took God's name. He tapped his thigh. Who will dare to touch him? Everyone is sweating bullets looking at Singhara's body. Singhara has taken everyone back. Let's see who dares to touch Singhara. Kaala from Canada has embraced him. He is trying to ground him. He is trying to stick his leg in and lock him. He has locked him and lifted him. He is taking him away. Singhara. - Well done. He is lifting it like a water bucket. And the point goes to India. Let's see what's the score so far. India two and Canada zero. - Come on. Come on. Canada's Malkit Meeta is raiding. He has a cloth covering his hair. He is a handsome Sikh. Here Clutch has grabbed him. India's number one stopper. His hands are slipping away from Meeta's body. He has had Canada's butter. He has thrown him away. And the point goes to Canada. - They have applied gel on his body. Clutch is angry and is arguing with the referee. But the referee isn't listening to him. India's raider Dheera is going on a raid. There is a spark in the team's coach Sucha Singh's eyes. Dheera is approaching with his arms spread wide. A very different style. - Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. - Let's see what happens. Dheera is moving around Canada's embracers. Let's see whom Dheera engages. - Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Another try by Dheera. - Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. There a player has embraced him. Canada's player has pushed him down. In the centre of the ground. He has caught his neck. Canada's embracer is not letting go of Dheera's neck. The whistle is blown and a point is given to Canada's team. My ears are hurting with their shouts. Lazy bone. - What have you done? - Go. Enough of this. | don't want to play Kabaddi. Canada's Harry is going on a raid. Now let's see how he dances on his heels with the embracers. Go. - Jaila has messed with him and he was thrown on the ground. Clutch is very angry. - What is wrong with you? Yes, my team. My team is winning. India 12 points and Canada 13 points. Indian team's captain is going for a raid with full vigor.. ...to save its reputation. Now see Singhara play with Canada's embracers. Let's see who dare to mess with him. He touched Jeevan.

He caught him and embraced him.. ...and he throws the Indian team's captain in the ground. There is happiness in Canada's team. People are dancing in UK's ground. Canada is ahead of India by three points. And there the whistle for half time is blown. Mr. Sandhu. Drugs are a great invention. You will be a beast. A beast. Sir, how can he throw me? They have surely taken drugs. Sir, they have even applied gel on their body. Our hands slip. Your hands are bound to slip. They too have had imported cow's butter. They should undergo a dope test, sir. Now will you make new rules for Kabaddi? Now will you teach the Kabaddi coach Sandhu? Learn to accept defeat. Be a sportsman. Mr. Sandhu, at least you don't talk about sportsmanship. Shinda is going for the first raid after half time. - Come on. Canada team is leading. - Come on. Come on. You move back. - Clutch has grabbed his leg. Jaila too touched him. Double touch and the point goes to Canada. You are acting as if you are a great embracer. Clutch in a mood to fight with Jaila. Team players separating them. End it. Well done. - Go for it. Balbir Bittu, from Jaspalwanger is going on a raid. A very experienced raider of Indian team. He is watching the leg movements of his opponents. Balbir Bittu plays a different type of Kabaddi. Jeevan has touched him and both of them are wrestling. Two buffaloes are fighting in the UK ground.

Canada wins the match with India by 18 points. And with that India face a very brutal defeat.. ...in UK Kabaddi World Cup 2010. Canadian team is dancing in joy for their victory. - Very good. They are celebrating. - Yes. On the other hand the Indian team looks sad. Because with this match the Indian team is out of the world cup. Okay. Bye. See you. So, captain, how was it? You are a loser both the ways. You lost the match as well as the money. You defeated me deceitfully. I didn't sell my dignity. I didn't sell my country. We don't play matches. But we play a game. Not with muscles, but with brains. Mr. Loser, pack your bags.. Mr. Sandhu, what do you say in Punjab? Pack your.. No, no, no. That dialogue is old. Okay. - Now they say move your asses. No, no. They say take cannabis. No, no, no. Don't mention that. - Okay. It is a drug. Sadhu, did you take everything? - Yes, I did. My shoes were up there. Did you take them? - Yes. Did you take the passports? - I did. Everybody's. All set. - Yes. So boys, are you ready to leave? - The taxi isn't here. We are ready. No one went to get one? - Brother has gone to get one. But they are here since morning. Don't they have to leave? What is it? You guys didn't pack your bags? Bags? We will come later. You were very eager to come here. Quietly pack your bags. We won't leave. You can do whatever you want. I'll see how you won't go. | have everyone's passports. We have Rs. 25 lakhs each to come to UK. We won't leave. You can do whatever you please with the passport. What is your problem? What is your problem? You have already disgraced us by making us lose the match. And now you are going to malign our name.. ...by dragging us into illegal human trafficking case. Clutch, get them. We are not impotents. We are not impotents. Got it? | won't spare you. - Let me show you. Let go. Let go. Move aside. Don't you have any shame? And why are you creating a scene? This is UK. Here even the police cuff your hand behind. You will yearn to scratch yourself. Then you will rot in prison. -You.. You are great. You do illegal human trafficking. And we will rot in the prison? | am sorry to say this, Mr. Sandhu.. ...but you are not a coach but a disgrace to all the coaches. And I consider it an insult to Kabaddi if I raise my hand on you. But one thing I can do for sure. Like you made me lose, I will make you and your men lose. No one will be spared. Clutch. Get them. Let go of me. - Get them. Quietly pack your bags and get ready to leave. I won't let you.. You want to stay in England. - Let go. Stop it, boys. | said, I won't go back. | won't go back. I'll not leave them till they come with us. Hello. Yes. Yes, please, can I talk to the police? Yes, yes. There is a fight going on down here. Breaking news. A racket doing illegal human trafficking.. ...to UK under the pretext of Kabaddi was exposed today. Police arrested these players when.. ...they were fighting over division of money. Punjab's well known player Singhara Singh.. ...and Shan-e-Punjab Kabaddi Federation's coach.. ...were arrested in London. Three fake players of the team accepted that.. ...they paid Rs. 25 lakhs each to come to UK. UK police has deported rest of the team back to India. But the team's coach Sucha Singh Sandhu.. ...and captain Singhara Singh are in UK prison. Police suspects that they are linked with the players.. ...who were caught at UK airport with heroine worth billions. You were angry when he left. The ill-omen had to do something untoward. I am the one who got disgraced. | cannot go outside the house now. Kiran, you? Kiran, how come you are here? Oh, yes. You must be here on your honeymoon with Sandeep. Yes. You are a rich father's daughter. And you got married to a cricketer. It's not like you think it is, Singhara. What do you mean? | mean Sandeep.. He married another girl to get selected for the Indian team. But why? Because she was a minister's daughter. Sports minister's daughter. Her father had a condition that if Sandeep.. ...wants to be a part of the Indian cricket team.. ...then he will have to marry his mentally retarded daughter. And Sandeep, he didn't think of me even once. And he agreed to marry her. Singhara, I know, | had become very materialistic. But Sandeep.. Sandeep turned out to be more materialistic than me. Kiran, those who love money don't value any relationship. So, what brings you here? | wanted to go away from my past memories. Hence we shifted to UK. There is a famous lawyer here. Mr. Daniel. I am assisting him. Today, when I read in the newspaper.. ...that you have been arrested, I couldn't stop myself. And so, I came to meet you. Kiran, God always is with honest people. You have come here as God for me. Don't worry, Singhara. Everything will be fine. | have spoken to Mr. Daniel. And..and he is a famous lawyer. He will fight your case. Singhara is a gem. If there would have been anyone in place of Singhara.. ...he would have pocketed the money Sandhu was offering. This was done by Sandhu and the promoter. And my innocent brother got trapped. Who is innocent? The one who is in a prison in England? Hello, Gurdayal Singh. Have a seat. We are not here to sit, sir. We have come to talk to the point. Chand Singh, what is it? Sir, actually, he.. - Why are you hesitating? If you cannot say it then I will. As you wish. Look, the truth is, we cannot keep any relations with this family. Why, Gurdayal Singh? Why? Everyone in the world knows what does your son do.. ...under the pretext of Kabaddi. People have seen it on television. The news is in the newspaper. And you ask me why? He is not at fault in this, sir. Yes, yes. This boy, Kirpal Singh was with him. You can ask him. He is innocent. Who all will we tell? He just got caught doing illegal human trafficking. Who knows tomorrow we come to know he is a drug smuggler. We rather stay away from such a relationship. Let's go, Chand Singh. Come on. You can return the gifts tomorrow. Let's go. Forgive me, Nachattar Singh. The matter was out of my hands. Saw that? Your son's Kabaddi disgraced us. According to the investigation.. .It is clear that Mr. Sandhu and Mr. Pal.. ...are the mastermind behind illegal human trafficking. Mr. Nikka Singh from India is also a culprit. I will refer this case to the government of India.. ...to take action against travel agent Nikka Singh. Mr. Sandhu and Mr. Pal are sentenced to two years imprisonment. Mr. Singhara Singh, you are acquitted from further investigation. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. Daniel. Thanks. It wouldn't have been possible without you. Greatest of pleasure, sir. Thanks. Sorry, Mr. Sandhu. You, too, have to go to prison with me. Well, I tried my best to save us. Mr. Pal. - Yes. | was wondering there were so many other names to keep. My mother unnecessarily named me Sucha Singh, the Kabaddi coach. Thanks. Kiran, I can never forget this favor of yours. No, Singhara. Dear ones never do favors. It's okay. Singhara.. Thoughts have surrounded me. Where has time brought me? Thoughts have surrounded me. Where has time brought me? Today, how do I beg for.. The gem that I had rejected. This regret will last a lifetime. This regret will last a lifetime. I'll try to repent with my tears. Calm down. Brace yourself, my heart. Now he will never be mine. Calm down. Brace yourself, my heart. Now he will never be mine. Remember, Phinda, we don't have to kill him. We have to tear him apart. So that, he yearns all his life to play Kabaddi. He didn't let us stay in UK. We won't let him play Kabaddi. Don't worry. He won't go home from airport. He will directly go to the hospital. He is here. Put your car in gear. Come on. Start the car. Oh God. Oh God. Saw that? We taught him a lesson. - Well done, buddy. He was acting smart. - Stop. Sister, where is Singhara Singh's room? That way. In that room. - Okay. Hurry up. - I hope everything is fine. Singhara, my son. - Mother. Why didn't I die before seeing this day? | should have died, mother. What's the use of living now? There is no reason for you to live. What did your Kabaddi gave you? Insult, bad name. Now you are here with a broken leg. Can't you keep quiet? Is this the right time to say such things? It would have rather been better if ...I would have broken his legs and made him sit at home. Brother, at least look at the situation before you speak. Girl, did they take the situation under consideration? We were at home, worried.. ...they came from Gujjral and taunted us. Because of him my daughter's engagement broke. Rano's alliance.. - Yes. Father. Have you come here to encourage brother or to fight him? Don't worry. Kabaddi first look away my brother who was like a son to me. And now..my son's leg.. At least listen to me, sir. Sir, I send unemployed people abroad. Look, it's not a crime to send people abroad. It is not a crime. But it is a crime to send them abroad through illegal means. I sent them legally. I didn't send them on a cycle. You send three people with the Kabaddi team.. ...by taking Rs. 25 lakhs from each of them. There is an enquiry being made by the Interpol. Sir, let's settle this right here. This scoundrel wants to settle things here. Throw him into the car. - Sir, listen to me. Nikka Singh Lamting. - Sir, listen.. - Today, I'll make you tall. Listen to me. - Quiet. Sit down. Be quiet. Yes. Brother. You drank today as well. Singhara, what is this? You get drunk everyday. Do you want to once again break the bones by falling.. ...that have barely managed to grow back? Talk softly, sister. Brother will create a scene if he gets up. Singhara.. Son, you.. Why do you trouble your mothers? Now I don't play Kabaddi. You are still troubled? You cannot play Kabaddi by getting drunk. Have medicines. Drink milk, have clarified butter. Brother, you used to give lectures to other boys against intoxicants. Now you too.. No, brother. You are not the same anymore. Yes. I am not the same anymore. I am a handicap. - No. Crippled. Because of me..my sister.. ...couldn't get married. Because of me.. ...my father has to hear other people's taunts. | became a burden on you because of my broken leg. A burden. Can a son ever be a burden to his parents? Yes. I am a burden. A handicap. Crippled. A handicap. My life's dream.. My uncle Ranjit Singh.. - Son.. You are Mr. loser. Loser. Singhara.. My soul still wanders in England. You will win the world cup in England. Loser. You cannot get up? Shame on you. Shame on you. Loser. Shame on you. Shame on you. Ranjit, look what all your brother has to face. You were deceitfully given drugs, right? And your nephew.. | wonder what lies in his fate. Brother. Come. Breakfast is ready. Come, brother. Let me help you. My leg is broken. My hands are still intact. Singhara. Is this how you should talk to your younger sister? Come, son. Sit down. Let me serve you breakfast. You didn't have anything last night. - I am not hungry. Why aren't you hungry, son? You must've got acidity by drinking alcohol on empty stomach. Here, have some buttermilk. He doesn't like buttermilk. The bar must be open. What path has Singhara taken up, Nichattar Singh? He drinks alcohol all day long outside the bar. Now what do I say, Deshrama? He doesn't talk to me properly. He doesn't talk to you, right? But you can, right? You are his father. Nichattar Singh, take care of your son. Otherwise, you will regret it. You will regret it. I'll make a move. See you. Now, even the villagers have started talking. If you talk to him politely.. - What do you mean? I don't love him? He didn't break his leg. I have shattered from within. My son is an alcoholic. I cannot tolerate this. Brother, you should be affectionate towards him. He is unnecessarily acting stubborn. | say, you let the boy play Kabaddi. You will see, he will be hale and hearty in days. Brother, Singhara can't breathe without Kabaddi. You object him playing Kabaddi because.. ...you lost your brother because of it, right? If he was your brother, he was my husband. Who can be more hurt than me? But I have objection with him playing Kabaddi. Then.. Girl, it's not like I don't love my son. Someone should ask me as well what I am going through. | am suffering everyday. You suffering like this won't help. Brother, you go and bring him back home. Brother, this is not right. Why are you killing yourself by drinking everyday? Stop it. I am telling you, yet you are doing it. Anyway, I don't have a life without Kabaddi. You know how many times do I die everyday? When my loss comes before me. Come on, you have had enough. Come on, get up. I will take you home. Hold this. Hold it. What home are you talking about, Clutch? A place where my father taunts me everyday? My father thinks I am trouble. What else will he think of you? If you drink alcohol everyday, that is what he will think. He didn't like me playing Kabaddi either. 1 drink so that | can forget my loss. Till I don't go back to that ground and win.. | won't rest in peace, Clutch. And my father won't let me play Kabaddi. Why won't he? I will talk to uncle. You just get well soon. What do you mean, get well soon? I can still play Kabaddi. - Really? Here, I will do a raid. You try and grab me. He thinks he is a great embracer. Come on. Don't break your other leg. -Come on. Fine, master. You win. You are a great raider. I know. Father, you? Father, hit me. Hit me. - No, son. | once again started playing Kabaddi, father. Here, break both my legs and confine me in the house. - No. No, my son. - Otherwise, | won't stop playing Kabaddi, father. Clutch. Break this bottle and stab me. I cannot live as a burden on my father. My son, when did | say that you are a burden? Stop drinking that. | cannot tolerate this. Sometimes you say stop playing Kabaddi. Sometimes you say stop drinking alcohol. I should stop living, father. All your problems will get resolved. Why should you stop living, son? I will die. Then you can be happy. No. Uncle. Uncle. What are you doing? You should think sensibly. Let go of me, Kirpal Singh. - Hear that. It is better to die at once than die everyday. | die everyday when he comes home drunk. First my brother left me. Now he is talking about dying. Tell me what else can I do, father? Son, you can do whatever you please. Be a nice boy and stop drinking. No. Then.. Then.. Allow me to play Kabaddi, father. I cannot tolerate loss. I want to win and only win. Till I don't go back on that ground.. ...and wash off the blemish on me, | won't rest in peace, father. I won't rest in peace. Uncle, Singhara will never drink again. You just allow him to play Kabaddi. You can play all you want, my boys. Play all you want. I am with you. Over here. -Come on, do it. Desha. Singhara, you? What made you think of this poor man, today? When did I forget you, my friend? You are our brother. What is this you have gotten yourself into? Desire to play Kabaddi didn't me a chance to learn anything else. We had become animals playing Kabaddi. Beasts. And beasts bear burden. Brother, you had left us in a lurch. I had to do something. So.. Look, Singhara is not at all at fault in this. Come with us, you will know the truth. Brother, you said it and I accept it. And you don't need to give clarifications to your friends. No matter what, Desha. We won't let you do this work. | am getting my friends together and forming a Kabaddi team. You know, your brother couldn't win in UK without you. Come on. We will all play on that ground once again where your brother had lost. We all have to win on that ground. To tell you the truth, Singhara.. ...now I no longer feel like playing Kabaddi. Why so? Don't you want to pay back your mother for what she did? That is what I am doing. By working. During the day I carry sacks and at night.. ...| carry mother on my shoulders. Why? What happened to her? Arthritis. Her knees don't work. She lies lifeless, like a sack. I think I am destined to do this. Now you tell me, should | play Kabaddi or get mother treated? What are you saying? We have to play an international tournament. Not a village tournament. We will make millions. Everything is possible with money nowadays. We will get mother new knees. Your thighs are very strong. And I need a raider like you. No one needs us. And we don't need anyone. They forgot us. We take this injection and forgot everyone. A renowned Kabaddi player is taking drugs. This is not right, brother. Singhara, you? Good, you at least recognized me. After all you are an international player. | heard you broke your leg. Are you alright now? I am sad to hear that. Great. Great. Satta, if you were feeling so sad.. ...then you should have come home to enquire. You are international players. I didn't know.. Whether you would recognize me if I would go to your house. You have started taunting me. Everyone knows Sandhu was behind this. | wanted all of you to come with me. People like Sandhu have given the game a bad name. What have you gotten into being a player? You didn't take me to England. Villagers taunted me and made my life miserable. Now I use this injection and forget all the taunts. Satta, we have to wash off the blemish on our names. Is that possible? Why not? My leg is broken, not my courage. We are forming Ranjit Kabaddi Academy. In uncle's memory. Singhara wants all of us to play in it. And that we should form the number one team of Kabaddi. When my friends are asking me to join them how can Satta refuse? I had told you to transfer your land to me. Now you will lose everything, your land, cattle and all. And you won't even get any money for it. Come on, give your thumb impression on these papers. How can I do that? My children will be on the streets. My children will be on the streets.. ...when I break your bones and make you useless. Well done. What arrogance Harjeet Singh Tufaan has! Remember, the village committee gathered clarified butter for you. When you won the first match chief gifted you a buffalo. A player who used to makes renowned embracers sweat bullets.. ...on the ground, is now a goon and breaks people's bones. Great. You are incomparable. You, too, are incomparable, Singhara. You left your friends behind at the airport. Remember? One should learn how to deceit from you. Deceit? Sandhu deceived me. My dream of victory was shattered. I had to spend time in UK prison. | was accused of so many things. My leg was broken. 1, too, could have broken their legs. Tufaan, this isn't something a player does. Desha is better than you. He did a labor job when he was in trouble. But he didn't choose the wrong path. Forget the past. Look, we have come to take you. Singhara wants us to play together. Shut up, Singhara's sycophant. And brother, what did you gain by breaking your bones for Kabaddi? Look at me. Everyone is scared of me. Even ministers give me money during elections. Brother, in Kabaddi we used to get our bones broken. Now I break bones. And I get money to do that. Business. Hooliganism meets a bad end, Tufaan. Millions of people who used to applaud at your raid.. ...on Kabaddi ground, now curse you. Fine. My team will always welcome you with open arms. If the player in you ever wakes up, don't hesitate. Come without any hesitation. Keep playing. You win some you lose some. When you fall, your friend helps you up. Keep playing. You win some you lose some. When you fall, your friend helps you up. We have to clear our names. Today, we take a pledge. Prepare yourselves. There is Kabaddi in every matter. There is Kabaddi in every element. There is Kabaddi even ina beautiful girl's anklet's tinkling. There is Kabaddi in every matter. There is Kabaddi in every element. There is Kabaddi even in a beautiful girl's anklet's tinkling. It is a part of our heritage. Kabaddi. Kabaddi is our pride. Kabaddi is our honor. Kabaddi is our pride. Kabaddi is our honor. Kabaddi. Brother, our team won and showed the whole of Punjab.. ...that you are determined then you can achieve anything. But there is one thing that always troubles me. That we couldn't get a player like Tufaan to join us. A Kabaddi player is now a hooligan. This is a very shameful thing for us. Brother, it is a shameful thing for me. You had asked me to ponder over it. I did, my friend. I had got strayed. The player in me is awake, Singhara. Will Ranjit Academy accept this hooligan? Welcome, my friend. But tell me, what made you change your mind. | used to read it in the newspaper everyday.. ...that Ranjit Academy won the match at this place. Singhara Singh, the captain was awarded. It used to pinch me when I read such news. I, too, was once a member of this team. That's it. Today, I couldn't stop myself. Hence I came here. Okay, how our team is complete. Now we have only one desire. We have to go to England and win on the ground where we had lost. What's the problem, brother? You can take me wherever you want. I am with you. That's fine, Tufaan. But who will sponsor us in UK? We have already been tagged as human traffickers. We have been blacklisted in the England embassy. God helps those who help themselves. Mr. Bari, you? Not Mr. Bari, address me as uncle, nephew. You forgot your first match? How can I forget it, uncle? But what brings you here all of a sudden? Look Singhara, I have stopped giving commentary for games. Nowadays, I am writing a book on Kabaddi. | want to write about what happened.. ...with you and your team in UK, in my book. That is when people will know the truth. Do write about it, uncle. So that the ones who do business.. ...under the cover of Kabaddi can be unmasked. And now I have only one desire, uncle. We have to clear our name. But I also know that my team can no longer go to UK. You have already lost hope, Singhara. Why can't your team go there? If you have a good sponsor everything will be taken care of. Do you think anyone will sponsor our team after all that has happened? The truth is this world is surviving because of honest people. I know someone who sponsors clean Kabaddi. No human trafficking, no drugs. Who is that person? Harjinder Singh Dhanwa from Parshurampur. Who doesn't know him, uncle? But will he sponsor our team? Why won't he? He is my friend. He never refuses me. When these young Punjabi men decide upon something. Punjabi men. These young Punjabi men fear no one. Punjabi men. People who were nurtured well.. Today, it's time to pay back all the love you got. Claim your right. It's time to fight. Claim your right. It's time to fight. My friends. My buddies. My friends. My buddies. Grab him. Drag him. Grab him. Drop him. Kabaddi is a game.. Kabaddi is a game.. Yes, Kabaddi. Kabaddi is a game of Punjabis, my friend. We will win the battle. Brave Punjabis. Go for it. Go for it, young men. It will be useful.. It will be useful.. Great, Kabaddi. It will be useful now, the diet that you have had. The thicken milk that you had. Brave Punjabis. Go for it. Go for it. Go for it. Get up, brave men. Pledge takers. Get up, brave men. Brave men. Brave men. Pledge takers. Get up and claim the ground. Win the battle.. Win the battle and return, my friends. Don't owe any debts. My dear.. My dear.. We have to make our game famous. We have to make our game famous. Today, the water will be under the bridge. Horns have been locked. No one should interfere. Horns have been locked. Today, the water will be under the bridge. Horns have been locked. No one should interfere. Horns have been locked. There is an earthquake on the ground. No one can dare stand before a lion? Everyone can try their best against them. They jump like cheetahs. Kabaddi is played under any circumstances. Kabaddi is played throughout the year. The drums are played in the fair. The drums are played in the fair. Kabaddi lies in its beats. Kabaddi is a gift of God. Kabaddi is our pride. Kabaddi is our honor. Kabaddi is our pride. Kabaddi is our honor. Kabaddi. - Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Mr. Singhara Singh, how do you feel? You have been continuously winning all the matches. Today, you have reached the finals. How do you feel? - We are feeling very good. My players have worked very hard to reach the finals. We will have a good fight with Pakistan tomorrow. Yes, of course, Mr. Singhara Singh. But Pakistan's team hasn't lost a single match either. So, what do you think, will you win the match? Tomorrow, this isn't going to be a Kabaddi ground. It is going to be a battlefield. Come, now let's talk to Kabaddi coach of the Pakistani team. Clutch, get ready. - And also the captain. Sir, what would you like to say? Pakistan has been winning matches.. - Singhara. And Indian team has been on par with yours. - Kiran, you? I am standing on your way and you didn't even look at me. Kiran, at the moment, I cannot see anything other than Kabaddi. Today, I have realized you were a gem. A gem. I am the one who didn't value you right. I am sorry, Singhara. I am really sorry. Can we..once again have the relationship we had in college? Kiran, at the moment, the only thing I love is Kabaddi. And I can see Kabaddi dressed as my bride. Tomorrow, if someone steals my girlfriend from me..
