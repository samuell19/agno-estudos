There's a problem on Line 3A! Shut it down! Here. Don't act like this. Let go. Let go. We already agreed, it's over! Let go! Get away from me! You're insane! Get off! Get off me! You're sick. I heard they found body parts in another coal stack. In Qingyuan, Pingbaishui, and Zhicheng factories. All over the place. Damn, that's an area of over 100 miles. It can't be just one body. Hey, did they find the head? Yeah, but it doesn't mean that they can identify it. I heard it was a naked woman, and the security guards found a breast at the coal depot. Quiet, the guards are back. This is the worst case I've seen. Body parts are being dumped and scattered across the whole province. There are so many rumors of corpses in coal stacks. Everyone is scared to come to work. If you can't crack this case... I found something! Liang Zhijun! His name is Liang Zhijun! I got an ID card and some bloody clothes! Your husband's dead. We understand your pain. The more you can tell us about your husband Liang Zhijun, the faster we can solve this case. No point in crying. You're just wasting time. We need your cooperation. Take a good look. Is that him? Yes, that's Liang Zhijun. He's not a talkative guy. I used to beat him at chess. He worked here at the coal scales for 8 years and never made any enemies. The last time you saw Liang Zhijun, did you notice anything strange? Nah, it was shift change. His locker's over there. I asked around. Most drivers deliver coal to the same two factories. This one guy, Liu Fayin, made deliveries to a dozen plants around the time of the murder. It seems fishy. They're the same factories where the body parts turned up. We're talking 15 factories, in 6 different cities and counties. Even if he drove for 3 days straight, there's no way he could hit all those places. Unless he had help. I checked. He's got a younger brother. He used to take him on his route. That was until he quit two days ago. Are you Liu Fayin? Police. Come with us. Stop! Zhang, let go! Let go! Qiangjun! Cuff them. Frisk him first. Cuffs locked? On your knees! Over here. Squau You're Liu Fayin? Huh? Do you know why we're here? Don't play innocent. Who drove the truck? Speak up. Me. Head down. You. Head up. - He ran the fastest. - I said head up! Why would you run? Why would you run? Answer him. Tell us what you did! All right, all right. Take them in for questioning. I'll deal with you later. Bastard! Enough. Go get the car. This is police business. Get out of here. That goes for you, too. You all right, Sarge? Thought you'd make a run for it, huh? You'll pay for this later. You okay, Xueyi? Yeah. Did you play the lottery today? Nah, I had to arrest these creeps. Too bad. You probably would have won. Little fuckers. Did you hurt your back? Is that his jacket? I'll check. It's me. Just me. Zhang. Thanks, doc. You take care, now. Goodbye. Bye. Take care. What's with you? Those quacks mess with your head? I was just thinking of Qiangjun and Xueyi. I missed their funerals. Maybe I should visit their families. No, they're still getting over it. Best not upset them. We'll go for a visit later. First I have to drop something off. Took you long enough. She's burying Liang Zhijun's ashes. Hey, buddy! Buddy? You drunk? You shouldn't be out so late. What's wrong? I'm fine! Motherfucker... Not my bike! Here's what's left of the noodles, officer. I need to see everyone's ID. Where's the waiter? Poor kid's so scared, he's hiding in the back. Don't breathe a word of this. How could this happen? I ate half before I realized. I thought it was beef! I demand compensation! Don't give me that! I'm a victim here, too! Shut up! Crybaby! You, in back! You're from Team 2? Line up. What brings you in today, boss? - Just wanted to help out. - Not likely! And see your pretty face. - Don't worry, there's enough to go around. - Your new uniform and gloves. - Isn't Team 3 here? - No. Not here, eh? You hung over again? And why so late? Some fucker... ...stole my bike. Listen Zhang, since you transferred to our security team, you've been hung-over every day. You think being shot in the line of duty merits special treatment? Just look at that face. You look terrible. You need a wife to look after you. - Anyone want to help Zhang find a wife? - We've got one here! What are you doing? Stop it! Who'd marry this drunk? Oh god, he reeks. If a man's not a boozer, in bed he's a loser! Your typical bullshit! - Besides, I've got a man at home. - Not as good as me! Kiss her! Give her a kiss! Go on, kiss her! How's it going, Detective Wang? I heard they promoted you to handling white-collar crime. You heard wrong. I'm here on a stakeout. You are? Sorry to interrupt. I didn't say you had to leave. - So, how have you been? - I've been better. You can talk. He's one of us. These are photos from the recent murder and the 2001 case. Both victims were romantically linked to this woman. The 2001 victim disappeared the day before the wedding. The second was killed right after he started dating her. Where'd they work? Both were former factory workers who quit to go into business. And the crime scenes? It snowed right after. No clues at either scene. But both victims were wearing ice skates. I think they were killed while skating outdoors. Someone's leaving. It's her. Slow down. Not too close. Hey, Zhang? Yeah? Remember that coal scale operator? Liang Zhijun? That's his wife. Wu Zhizhen, the laundry shop clerk. So counting Liang Zhijun, she's connected to three murders. Seems that way. Every man she's with ends up dead. I want these dry-cleaned. How much? Thirty yuan. And some new tenants, southerners, moved into the fifth floor flat. They're in sales, I think. I don't think it's a pyramid scheme, but I'll keep an eye on them, anyway. We appreciate your vigilance. Glad I could help, Officer Wu. Anytime you need to keep tabs on someone, just let me know. Right. This is Detective Wang, of the crime squad. He wants to ask you something. Nice to meet you, detective. How can I be of help? Never mind her. Go on, detective. Maybe we can talk outside. Okay. What on earth? Who brought a horse in here? It's been wandering around the neighborhood. It looked cold and hungry, so the neighbors brought it in. Who's the owner? A scrap collector, I think. But no one's seen him in days. Mrs. Lu, over here. - I need information about someone. - Who'? You know He Wngrong", he owns the Rang Rong Laundry'? Sure. And the woman who works for him, Wu Zhizhen? I know her. What's their relationship? You can pick these up... day after tomorrow. - What time? - Afternoon. See you then. Hey, what'd you do to this? What's wrong? Look at this. The button's missing. Oh, sorry. Let me sew it back on. You've been open five, six years? Ought to start a franchise. Who can afford to? If not a franchise, then another mom-and-pop shop. Not likely. She's my type, but I'm not hers. Don't get the wrong idea. I just feel sorry for her. She's had it hard, ask anyone. When we first opened in '99, she managed to ruin a leather coat. Then her husband died, suddenly. Couldn't bring myself to fire her. It's a tough business, this. I'll say. Guy wanted her to pay 28,000 for the coat. Back in '99, a fortune. Next to that, a button's nothing. But she got lucky. The guy bugged her for a week, then never came back. Couple days ago, I was cleaning up, and found the coat. I thought about returning it. But you changed your mind? I figured, why go looking for trouble? Stay out of trouble, that's my motto. All done. Thanks. Laundry delivery. Hey, there. So, is it the both of you? What are you doing? What's going on? Know all the tricks, do you? He only paid me 100. Nothing happened. Just trying on dresses. Trying on what? Dresses, he had me try on different styles of dresses... I thought he was in fashion, but I guess he was just a pervert. What kind of pervert? How would I know? We were just joking around. Well, we're not. Let's go. Wait, I didn't do anything! Can't we talk this over? Today's the fire drill; it was organized by our security team. You all know what to expect, so take your jobs seriously! This is an important drill, people! Understand? Understood. Okay, let's begin! You know how to use this? Extinguishers at the ready! Watch how Zhang does it, everyone! Anyone here? I'm picking up my laundry. Did you hear me? I'm here for my laundry. You're here... to pick up? I'll get it. That's for your hand. Medicine and bandages, for your hand. Wash this. Wash your own damn sweater! Trying to pick a fight? Can't you see we're busy? - You know who I am? - A little shit who's leaving! You want trouble? - You looking to die? - Try it again, I dare you! Now fuck off! - Before I kill you! - Just wait! Just you wait! Stop following me. Next time... let's go skating outdoors. What? Ice-skating. Actually, I can't really skate. No matter. I'll teach you. I shouldn't have let you in the car that day. And here I thought we were friends. This is no way to get sober. Steer clear of her. Who says I want to get sober? I'm just looking... for something to do. So my life isn't a total loss. What? You think anyone ever wins at life? Where do you think you're going? You haven't returned your skates! Stop. Police. Turn around. Hands behind your back. I hurt my arm skating. Turn back around. Give me your hand. Seems a bit late to be out skating. My skate broke. I was taking it to be fixed. It broke? The other one. Stand still. Know why I'm arresting you? Li, I caught the suspect. I'm bringing him in right now. Well? Stop pushing! You scraped my coat. How much? 5 yuan. What can I get you? Mutton soup. Hello, Dear. Who's it? - You here alone? - Yeah. Then I'm the guy asking you to dance, okay? Okay. Besides, you looked bored. I've never seen you here before. Excuse me. I'm looking for someone. Paging Comrade Liang Zhijun. Please come to the broadcast booth. Someone is looking for you. Paging Comrade Liang Zhijun, Comrade Liang Zhijun... someone is looking for you. I had the wrong bus. Should have been not I mixed up the plates. The bus was so crowded, I couldn't manage to... I tried everything, Chief, but she won't talk. She wants to see Zhang. Let me try. Leave us alone. If you keep this up, I'll have to find a new laundry. I had no idea you were a cop. Why'd you lie? Who says I'm a cop? Listen. You've got a long life ahead of you. I wouldn't lie about that. Today I saw a man dumping body parts from a bridge over a railway junction. Parts of my friend and fellow officer... are probably scattered all over the country by now. It reminded me of an unsolved case- body parts turning up in coal stacks all over the province, on the same day. That was in '99. Remember that? But who could cover that much ground in a single day? Know what I think? It had to be the coal scale operator. Every truck passed through that weighing station that day. It was the only point that they all had in common. If he loaded the body parts on trucks during the night shift, by the next morning, they'd be all over the province, or burned to ashes in furnaces. Wasn't your husband, Liang Zhijun, a coal scale operator? In 1999, he accidentally killed someone during his first robbery. He decided to fake his own death, using the victim's corpse as his stand in, That way you'd never find him. He managed to fool all of you, but then he could never reappear. He got lucky. Back then, DNA testing wasn't widespread. Lucky? He's been in hiding all these years, spying on everything I do. It's like living with a dead man. I wanted to escape him, but I couldn't. He killed every man who ever loved me. Who could I tell? He'd kill me if I talked. She gave him up. Says she calls him from the payphone on Jiefang Road. Let's go. This is for you. Did you buy cigarettes? No. I'll go. Not yet. I'll get the smokes. Wait here. Stop! Freeze! Is he dead? Was he hit? He's dead, chief. - What's his gun? - C-64 pistol. Nearly shot me. Stop following me. Just let me explain... No need. Hear me out. Don't be like this. I don't want your explanations! - Don't make trouble. - I don't want your explanations! I'm trying to help you! Don't make trouble, listen! It's going to be okay. One last thing. We need to test those ashes from 5 years ago. I threw them in the river. The river? - You didn't keep any? - No. I couldn't stand to look at them. I still have some questions. Can we talk in the car? You're back. It's fucking freezing out. Then why not go home? Hey. Hey... Seems it was another poor bastard killed 5 years ago. Hey, there. Can you clean this leather coat? Sure. This'll be ready... day after tomorrow. - Two days? - Yeah. Be careful with it. Don't worry. Give me that leather coat. It's his. No, the one she ruined back in '99. The 28,000-yuan coat. Okay, but... Give it. All right. The guy never came back for it? Nope. - And you thought of returning it? - Yeah. So you've got his address? Right here. I'll pay you 1,000 for the coat. No one wants it anyway. I'm betting on Chelsea. It's called loyalty, you fucker. And I'll bet on whoever I want. 20,000 on Chelsea. Add it to the pool. If I lose, dock me. Oh yeah, and tell the Fox that kid from the tax bureau can't pay off his debt with a beat-up Jetta. Yeah, I hate him. I want half the cash now, and if he's one cent short, I'll... Are you the manager, Zhao Jianping? Yeah, who are you? Glad I found you. This coat... - I don't want that crappy thing. - Wait, hear me out. I'm from Rong Rong Laundry. Our shop's being demolished, and I found this leather coat... with your card in the pocket. That's my old card, but I'd never wear a coat like that. It's a miracle you tracked me down. Must be five years now. In '99, I'd just started my clothing export business. Gave out a lot of cards. - You're not in export anymore? - No, I got into the Internet business. Since you went to all this trouble, I'll think it over and see if I can remember which one of my friends might have had a coat like that. It's like being in a dream, seeing this old card again. I won 100,000 yesterday. I didn't dream that, did I? Stupid game! It should have been mine! You little shit! Behave yourself! Fuck! Call. Raise 500. My husband had a coat just like this. The last time I saw him was in our bar. A woman came for him. He left with her, and I never saw him again. What year was this? '99. What month? June, late June. You didn't report it? To the cops? If a man decides to run off with his mistress, the cops can't do shit. I did report it, a year later. Cops said he'd vanished. Not likely. Would you still recognize the woman? She stood at the door of the bar. I'd never forget that face. I'd recognize her anywhere. This same bar? Sure, even had the same name, Daylight Fireworks Club. Of course, we're bigger and better now. But memories, good or bad, never fade. Ma'am! Come here. You can name your price. Just tell me where they are. That's not why I'm here. I'm just delivering laundry. Delivering laundry! I brought my own bag. I need the dress for a party later. - Goodbye. - Bye-bye. See you later. There's a performance tonight at the amusement park. Want to go with me? Sorry I'm late. It's fine. There's no performance. Look over there. What'd you see? The Daylight Fireworks Club. Now... I want you to take the initiative, and tell me the whole truth. Better me than the police. What's that mean? Show some initiative. Here you go. I've got to open the shop. I'd better go. Want to meet up again tonight? Sure. Same place? Got the coat, bro? Remember the owner of this coat? Does he haunt your nightmares? His name was Li Lianqing. So, did you bury his ashes under the tree, or throw them in the river? What's the story? Back to HQ. I killed him. How? I couldn't afford to replace his coat. So he made me go to a hotel with him. It wasn't just the once. How'd you stab him? How many times? I don't remember. Was Liang Zhijun involved? No. He sacrificed everything for me, became a living dead man. But I betrayed him. Hey, you. You, there! I brought her scarf. - Move away from the car. - What's going on? We're on a case. What do you want? To give her this scarf. We need to confirm some details, but we'll have her back in a few days. I don't understand. She's assisting our investigation. We'll be in touch. We couldn't have cracked this case without Zhang's help. A toast, to Zhang. A toast! Drink! It was dumb luck. I was stumbling around in the dark. It was Detective Liu who put me on the right track. True. So modest! One, two, three... drink! This big tiger escaped in California. - A big viper? - No, a big tiger! Long time no see. - Business trip. - Been dancing elsewhere, eh? Lead your partner forward. Then switch positions, like this. We'll practice that step once more, then run through the whole routine. Learn any new steps? The cops are here! Hey, keep this area clear. Go play somewhere else. Okay, officer! We'll play over there. Hello. Police. Sorry to disturb you. What's he filming? Turn that off. Ma'am, we're gathering evidence for a case. The suspect lived here 5 years ago. Is that the police? Please, come in. Where'd you get the knife? From the kitchen. Show us. Stand by the pot. Point. Higher. Where'd you kill him? In the bedroom. Where'd you kill him? In the wardrobe? Used to be a bed there. Stand over there. Point to the wardrobe. Did you help cut up the body? No. Do you know where he dumped it? No. Officer Wang, we have to visit the dump site. Take her back to the station. Yes, sir. It came from up there! Get in the car. You two break up the crowd. Yes, sir! Units 3 and 4, deal with the drunk on the roof. You are in violation of the fireworks regulations. Stop immediately! Come down now, or I'll go up there and kick your ass! You'll be held responsible for any damage or injuries! Come down now! You, up there. Hey!
