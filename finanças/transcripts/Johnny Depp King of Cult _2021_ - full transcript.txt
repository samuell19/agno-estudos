- The only responsibility really, I think you have is to deliver something that's fresh each time, something that's new or at least to attempt that. The real responsibility is to entertain them, to try and make 'em laugh. That's really it. [upbeat country music] [Narrator] Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of his day and age in Hollywood and has carved a legacy for himself as a serious, well-rounded performer. - I started out to make a film that everyone will hate, to go out of your way to see if they'll just hate it. I've done that before, haven't I? - [Narrator] His tendency to frequently play freakishly eccentric outcast, whose oddities are misunderstood by society has made him one of the world's best character actors with iconic roles such as Captain Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka. - With all the characters I've played, they're still pretty close to the surface. There's still each and every one relatively accessible. - [Narrator] From his stranger roles like the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland to more conventional performances like John Dillinger in Public Enemies, Johnny Depp has managed to capture the hearts of millions, making him a household name. It's just so much fun to, well, get away with things that you're not normally allowed to get away with it. John is a lot of fun to write and he also helps out and contributes a lot to the character. He knows it so well. He knows what the character would say. He embellishes things so effectively. - He is sensationally professional and talented actor. - John, he's a legend, he [indistinct]. - [Narrator] Johnny Depp is Hollywood's chameleon. - I've just been very lucky over the years. It's a miracle that people still hire me after some of the stuff I've gotten away with. [audience chuckles] I mean, honestly. I lay it all down to luck. There was no way to predict, prior to Pirates of the Caribbean, I was labeled, they literally used to call me box office poison, which I was kind of okay with. That didn't bother me at all, then suddenly Pirates happened. Suddenly, Tim doesn't have to fight with studios to get me the gig anymore, which he had to for many years. It just happens. [gentle guitar music] - [Narrator] Initially known as a teen idol for his tortured pretty boy looks, Johnny Depp survived the perils of adolescent heartthrob status to earn a reputation as a respected adult actor. [gentle guitar music] Johnny Depp was born on June 9th, 1963 in Owensboro, Kentucky, the youngest of four children of waitress, Betty Sue Palmer and civil engineer, John Christopher Depp. - [Reporter] Johnny, what else can we expect to see you in? - Well, it's called something else now. I think it's called Learning to Fly. It'll be out in September. [upbeat music] - [Narrator] The family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Miramar, Florida in 1970. His parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15 and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Johnny has called an inspiration. Johnny was gifted a guitar by his mother when he was 12 years old and began playing in various bands. He dropped out of Miramar High School aged 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. He attempted to go back to school two weeks later but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. In 1980, he began playing guitar in a band called The Kids. After modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method. In December 1983, Johnny married makeup artist, Lori Anne Allison the sister of his band's bassist and singer. The Kids split up before signing a record deal in 1984 and Johnny subsequently began collaborating with the band, Rock City Angels. In the early 1980s, Johnny Depp's then wife, Lori Anne Allison introduced him to actor, Nicholas Cage who advised him to pursue an acting career. His first role was in the horror film, A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984 in which he played the boyfriend of heroine, Nancy Thompson and one of Freddy Krueger's victims. Johnny Depp became a teen idol during the late 1980s when he starred as an undercover police officer in a high school operation in the Fox television series, 21 Jump Street, which premiered in 1987. What are you doing? This is the way it works. Stare him down, Hansen. - Now the homeboy's in your face. He don't stay here to see if you punk out. - We can be like this for days, man. - No, you won't 'cause after you see that you ain't no punk and that you don't punk out, he's gon' to ask you where you from. - [Narrator] He accepted this role to work with actor, Frederic Forrest who inspired him. Despite his success, he felt that the series forced him into the role of product. He subsequently decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him. [bright guitar music] After his early acting experiences, Johnny began to prioritize roles he found more interesting rather than those he knew would instantly succeed at the box office. His first film release in 1990 was Cry-Baby, a musical comedy set in the 1950s. Although it was not a huge box office success upon its release, over the years, it has gained its status as a cult classic. 1990 also saw the beginning of Johnny Depp's infamous relationship and collaborations with Tim Burton. Their first collaboration saw Johnny and Edward Scissorhands alongside Winona Ryder. The film was a commercial and critical success and began the long association between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. Another of Johnny's memorable roles from the '90s was in the drama, What's Eating Gilbert Grape? In which he starred alongside another upcoming actor of the time, Leonardo DiCaprio. In 1994, Johnny took on his second collaboration with Tim Burton in Ed Wood, a biographical film about one of history's most inept film directors. Johnny has said the film gave him a chance to stretch out and have some fun with acting again. Ed Wood received a positive reception with many critics noting Johnny's performance, pointing out that he had proved himself as an established certified actor. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance. Johnny Depp's starred alongside Al Pacino in the 1997 crime drama, Donnie Brasco. To prepare for this role, Johnny spent time with the real life Joe Pistone, on whose memoirs the film was based. Donnie Brasco was a commercial and critical success and is considered one of Johnny's finest performances. - [Narrator] He gave him his trust. - You gotta get rid of that mustache and get yourself a pair of pants. Dress just like me. - [Narrator] He loved him like a son. - Nobody can touch you because I represent you. Keep your nose clean, follow the rules, be a good earner and maybe one day when they open the books, you become a wise guy. I'd die with you, Donnie. - [Narrator] But he never knew the truth. [pistol fires] - [Man] There's a war going on in that mafia family and that is where Joe is undercover. Donnie, come here. - [Narrator] The end of the 1990s saw Johnny take on further memorable roles in the film, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as well as another collaboration with Tim Burton for the period film, Sleepy Hollow. Critics have described the characters he plays as iconic loners. Johnny's ability to embody all of the different characters he plays makes for a spectacular show on screen, improves his diversity as an actor. Johnny Depp began a relationship with French actress and singer, Vanessa Paradis, whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate in France in 1998. - [Interviewer] Have you ever seen someone across the room and had that feeling of true love at first site? - Yeah, we've been together about 11 years and we have two children. [Interviewer] What happened? - I saw her back from about 30 yards away, I saw her back and her neck and then turned around suddenly and looked at me. I was stupefied and then it was over. - [Narrator] They have two children, daughter, Lily Rose Melody Depp born in 1999 and son, John Christopher Depp III known as Jack born in 2002. He stated that having children has given him a real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life. - I mean, I think I was making choices back then for my kid so that when I was all dried up and burned out in this business, that my children would have something to be proud of or hopefully be proud of one day. They can watch it and say their dad did good work for a little while. [upbeat music] - [Narrator] In 2003, Johnny Depp stepped into what would become one of his most iconic roles. Walt Disney Pictures announced a new adventure film, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl and Johnny was playing the now infamous, Captain Jack Sparrow. [victorious music] The film was a worldwide success and Johnny earned widespread acclaim for his comic performance as Captain Jack, also receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for best actor. Captain Jack was basically... How I saw the character was a sort of weird combination between a 18th century rock and roll star, i.e, Keith Richards and then Pepe Le Pew, who was a skunk basically. [audience laughs] - [Narrator] The character of Captain Jack Sparrow is adored by fans who became instantly obsessed with his comical mannerisms and bizarre personality. Studio executives had at first been conflicted about his portrayal of the character but clearly Captain Jack is very popular with audiences. Pirates of the Caribbean became iconic and one of Disney's best loved action and adventure films with its popularity giving the creators incentive to begin work on a sequel. [bright music] In 2005, Johnny Depp, once again collaborated with Tim Burton in a new take on a classic story, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. In true Tim Burton's style, the film had a slightly dark plot keeping in theme with his usual creepy style. Johnny played Willy Wonka, a very different type of character to any he had played before. Once I found him, he was okay. All the sort of elements combined would get you there but the trick was finding him and Tim and I had had talks early on of what this Wonka might be, where he might be coming from which were very helpful, those discussions. Talking about children's show hosts like we seen as kids who talk this bizarre kind of speech pattern, rhythm that's very melodic and kind of stressful. "Hello children, how are you today?" That sort of thing became the foundation for the guy and then you just started thinking about other things like game show hosts and stuff like that. Once I found him, it was pretty easy to get there every day. - [Narrator] The way his character was styled has now become memorable as the look of Willy Wonka, the one that children will often dress up as. - One of the more interesting sequences to film was when Tim locked us in the great glass elevator, suspended 100 feet in the air, very hot, children and that kind of thing and then having to imagine what Fudge Mountain looks like and the sheep being sheared. That was a kind of an obtuse experience, but yeah. - [Narrator] Johnny Depp brings some amazing work to this role from the voice he puts on to over the top actions. His ability to push everything to its absolute limit makes it such a fun performance to watch. - Try some of my grass, please have a blink, please do. It's so delectable and so darn good looking. You can eat the grass? Of course you can. Everything in this room is eatable, even I'm eatable but that is called cannibalism, my dear children and it's in fact, frowned upon in most societies. Now, enjoy. Go on, shoo! - [Narrator] The fact that Willy Wonka's backstory featured quite heavily throughout the film gave it an unusual twist to the classic children's story. Getting an idea of where this wacky personality comes from was certainly interesting. This film was followed by another Burton collaboration in 2005, where Johnny voiced the character of Victor Van Dort in the stop-motion animated film, Corpse Bride. [bright music] 2006 saw the long awaited pirates sequel, Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest. Audiences couldn't wait to see Johnny reprise the role of Captain Jack Sparrow and according to several surveys at the time, this was the main reason many people went to see the film in cinemas. When we did the first one, we thought we'd put everything we could think of, a talking parrot and a monkey and skeleton, sword fighting skeletons but then we started going into the the sort of mystical history of the ocean and we came up with things like Davy Jones and the Kraken or Kraken or Kraken depending on who you talk about, the sea creature. There's more adventure, there's more action. We had a bigger budget so we got to have more fun. - [Narrator] The sequel also introduced Captain Jack's biggest rival, Davy Jones played by actor, Bill Nighy. [tense music] - Oh. - You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for 13 years. That was our agreement. - Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon. - Then you're a poor captain but a captain nonetheless. Have you not introduced yourself all these years as Captain Jack Sparrow? - [Narrator] Dead Man's Chest was closely followed by another sequel, Pirates of the Caribbean, At World's End in 2007. Both films were box office successes. - Well, this one, you get everything explained to you that was left so infuriatingly hanging last time. Everything is neatly dovetailed and resolved and you get to see why David Jones is actually surprisingly rather decent, tender, loving guy. No, unfortunately he remains a maniac but you at least get to see what happened to him and why he's so angry and intense. - [Narrator] As the third installment of the franchise seemed to wrap up some major plot lines, fans were worried this was the last they'd see of Captain Jack. The character that Johnny developed so in-depth, Captain Jack Sparrow is appreciated worldwide and Johnny regularly attends charity events for children's hospitals dressed as the infamous character to surprise and bring joy to the patients. In 2007, Johnny Depp took on the rule of murderous barber, Sweeney Todd for his sixth film with Tim Burton. Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was developed from the original 1979 stage musical and although Johnny was not a fan of the musical genre, he had grown to like the tail's treatment. - In the chair, come on, Sweeney's waiting. I want your [indistinct]. You sir, two, sir. Welcome to the grave. ♪ I will have vengeance ♪ I will have salvation I can guarantee the closest shave you'll ever known. - May the good Lord smile on you. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] Although he had performed in musical groups, Johnny was initially unsure that he would be able to perform the role which required him to sing. He recorded demos and worked with his old bandmate, Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach. Starring alongside fellow Tim Burton veteran, Helena Bonham Carter, the film was a huge success and was praised highly by critics. Johnny won a Golden Globe for his performance and was once again nominated for an Academy Award. Johnny Depp reunited with director, Terry Gilliam for the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus in 2009, in which Johnny, Jude Law and Colin Farrell each played the character initially portrayed by their friend, Heath Ledger, who died before the film was completed. All three actors gave their salaries to Ledger's daughter, Matilda. He then started in Michael Mann's, 1930s crime film, Public Enemies in which he portrayed real life gangster, John Dillinger. Dillinger was basically a guy who was public enemy number one but with me, myself, I never saw him as an enemy of the public. I always saw John Dillinger in a way as a 1930s version of the Robin Hood. [dramatic music] - [Woman] What is it exactly you do for a living? John Dillinger, I rob banks. - That's a serious thing to say to a girl you just met. - I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars and you. What else do you need to know? - Either way, I think that Johnny's done some of the most brilliant work that any actor, in particular Depp and it's the inside is exposed and I like him playing this kind of a character. A tough guy, a real man. It was really probably through Johnny, and maybe one other persons I won't name but if they didn't do it, I don't think I'd have done a movie. - I am declaring United States of America's first war on crime. [riffle fires] - [Man] Your task would be to get John Dillinger. Are you up to that task, Agent Purvis? Absolutely, sir. [indistinct] - [John] That's your money, mister? Yes. - We're here for the bank's money, not yours. Put it away. - [Man] Now the whole country thinks you're a damn hero. - Robbing banks is getting tougher. - We're having too good a time today, we ain't thinking about tomorrow. [Man] Well, you ought to. - Johnny! - Put some clothes on, miss. - [Interviewer] How long did it take you to go through a bank? - About one minute 40 seconds, flat. [crowd laughs] Well, here's a man who killed pretty boy [indistinct]. [gun fires] - The only way that you will leave a jail cell is when we take you out to execute you. - It is an interesting time for a film like this because when you when you look at John Dillinger back in those days with the public rooting for him, the public's sticking by him and supporting him at that time against the banks, against the government. In today's day and age, today's digital sort of whirlwind that where in because of the amount of cell phones and all that stuff, he would have been sold out in like a half a second. That's a kind of an interesting perspective on things. - Michael Mann was saying that he was looking forward to getting your way perhaps, from the more whimsical characters and getting you to play a tough guy 'cause he said that Johnny Depp is a tough guy. Was it nice getting your hands a bit dirtier? - Well, you always try and get your hands as dirty as possible in any case. Sure, it was nice to tackle a character like this. I don't think it's anything I've done before, which was part of the excitement and it's nice to fire a lot of Thompson submachine guns as well. - [Narrator] The next Depp-Burton collaboration was Alice in Wonderland in 2010. - [Reporter] This is your seventh collaboration with Tim Burton. Is there anything you will not do for this man? - No, I would absolutely do anything for the guy without question. Wouldn't matter. - [Narrator] He played the Mad Hatter alongside other A-list stars, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman. - I wanted the Hatter to, something that Tim and I early on we're talking about, if this guy were actually made up of different people, they would be the extreme sides of these people. I wanted to go extremely kind of dark and yeah, dangerous with the Scotts accent. I hope I arrived there. My kids actually saw the film 'cause I haven't. I sent them out there in the front lines. They saw it and loved it, absolutely adored it. Went crazy, quoting things from it and just thought it was amazing. Loved every character and weren't freaked out by it whatsoever. - [Narrator] This role, once again showed Johnny's amazing skills as a character actor developing the Mad Hatter into a larger than life role. - It was another one that you felt very strongly about, how he should look, what his behavior was like, in the end that he shouldn't be just very simply throwing a rubber ball into a room and letting them go nuts and just for laughs and stuff. I thought that there should be some other side to him, some degree of damage, some trauma in there. He's a bit damaged and yeah, I could more than anything again, to use the word luck again because I feel so lucky to have, well, to get away with it because each time out of the gate, there's always somebody that comes around and says, oh Jesus, what's he doing now? You kind of just feel, in a weird way and I don't mean this in a negative way but you've sort of infiltrated the enemy camp on some level and you made it through unscathed. My approach to the character, it was just the idea of trying to find those places inside to go from extreme sides of personality. One minute you're at full capacity rage and then the next minute, you've dropped into some kind of horrific tailspin of fear and then you go to some very, great height of levity. That was just what I tried to do within scenes as much as I could find the right moments for him. - [Narrator] The following year saw the release of the fourth installment in the Pirates series, Pirates of the Caribbean, On Stranger Tides, much to the surprise of fans. - [Man] You could guide an expedition. You are Jack Sparrow. - There should be a captain in there somewhere. With all the characters you play, I mean, at least for me, with all the characters I've played, they're still pretty close to the surface. They're still each and every one relatively accessible. You're right though. Some of them, you have to work up to, and other one's just come a little bit easier and Captain Jack, certainly having played him now four times, he arrives pretty quickly. [Johnny chuckles] He arrives a little too quickly but in fact, he arrives in life a lot, dropping your kids off at school and he'll just show up. - Jack Sparrow, this is his invention. It's his series. He's made it a success along with a lot of other talented people behind him and with him. It's his to champion and hopefully carry on. The fountain is the prize. - [crowd cheers] - Mermaid Waters, that could be our path. Steady as she goes. [Man] What's your play, Jack? - I thought I should give you warning, we're taking the ship. It's nothing personal. [speaking foreign language] [indistinct] you just, stay out of it. - I always leave a cliffhanger at the end and you think, I've got a funny feeling we're all gonna be getting back together again in another year or two. The crew are amazing. The set, the attention to detail, the costumes and the makeup makes our job really easy to do. - You always feel that responsibility and you feel grateful for great people like them to give me an opportunity to be part of it. I felt very welcome and I enjoyed every minute of it. - They'll be dangers along the way. Firstly, mermaids, zombies, Blackbeard, the pirate all pirates fear. - If I do not make it to the fountain, neither will you. [Jack screams] - Is that it? - I think so. [upbeat music] It has began, again! Are we not kingsmen? How is it we can never meet without you pointing something at me? There's the Jack I know. [tense music] Fight to the bitter end! - You know that feeling you get when you're standing in a high place to suddenly just jump? I don't have it. [tense music] Did everyone see that because I will not be doing it again. The only responsibility really, I think you have is to deliver something that's fresh each time, something that's new or at least to attempt that. The real responsibility is to entertain them, to try and make 'em laugh. That's really it. Already starting out as a pirate, you're not on good footing in terms of making an impression 'cause the pirate that's too good would probably be thrown out, wouldn't he? Thrown overboard. I think our only responsibility, my only responsibility is just to try and invent new situations, new bits and pieces that entertain. - [Narrator] The film featured new cast members who hadn't appeared in the earlier films, creating different storylines. This installment of the Pirate series was again, a box office success. - It's funny how the films have been accepted and how the characters have been accepted and you think back when we first started out on Pirates one, it was very simple. It's just like any other character, you just sort of grab bits and pieces and out comes this kind of weird little stew you've created and so what I'm saying is, none of us have done anything really different other than just kind of create these characters and then boom, whatever happened happened. It's the first time I was ever offered the opportunity to say, hey, there's a couple of more possibilities or there's a few more bits to mind in terms of the character and it's just so much fun to get away with things that you're not normally allowed to get away with, to be totally irreverent, to play as absurd as you'd like. It's a very special opportunity. [gentle music] - [Narrator] In 2011, Johnny Depp worked on a new animated film in which he voiced the title character, a lizard in Rango. The film had a worldwide appeal and showed Johnny could still create magic from behind a camera just using his voice to develop a lovable character. Johnny then returned to Hunter S. Thompson's work in a film adaptation of the novel, The Rum Diary which also became the first project undertaken by his production company, Infinitum Nihil. He found this novel and the novel got published 40 years after it was written. Then asked me to have a go at the screenplay for it, which I did. I'm a screenwriter, that's I do. Then to my amazement, he said, okay, now you can direct it and I was very resistant to that at first but, it's pretty cool being pulleyed by world's number one film star. No, you're doing it and phoning up, you're doing it, doing it. It's his face on screen. His risk, not mine. If the film is a complete failure, it's Johnny on screen, not me. - It was a book that almost never happened. Weirdly, it was something that I accidentally located when I was going through the manuscripts of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas with Hunter in his war room and we sat down and started reading the thing, cross-legged on the floor and Hunter said, "We should make this into a film." I said, "Yeah, maybe you should publish it first." - He is sensationally professional and talented actor but he's also a great painter and a great musician and he's got a wonderful library and I'm a bibliomaniac. I collect the same writers that he does so there was an immediate symbiosis between us on that level in that the first time we met, we sat there all afternoon talking about Verlaine and [indistinct] so that was all good stuff. - We worked very hard together to try to get it done and because it was such a long shot at that time, the two of us doing some sort unexpected tap dance to try to get money for the film. It didn't work very well and we kept pushing forward and then 2,500 made his exit. After we'd gotten Bruce on board, we pushed it through, but I mean, 14 years to get this thing made. - [Interviewer] So there's been a labor of love for you? - Of course, it was Hunter's last, one of his last dreams so I had to make it come true, there was no other way. I mean, obviously there's a little bit more responsibility in terms of you're playing someone who you knew and loved but an earlier version where he had not yet found the avenue for the rage or the voice itself. - [Interviewer] Did it get quite emotional at times? - Of course, because you're serving your best friend who's not there with you. - [Interviewer] Great, thank you so much. Thank you, thanks very much. - [Narrator] In 2012, Johnny Depp's starred in his eighth film with Tim Burton, Dark Shadows, alongside Michelle Pfeiffer and of course, Helena Bonham Carter. - I think it's one of Tim's finest yet again. I mean, he just keeps getting better and better as a filmmaker and as an artist but I certainly haven't gotten tired of working with Tim. I don't think I ever would. It's always fresh, it's always new, it's always different. It feels like the first time every time. - [Narrator] The film was based on the 1960s Gothic television soap opera of the same name, which had been one of his favorites as a child. Well, it was fair 'cause I mean, a lot of people know it. I mean, there was, there was a group of us like Johnny or Michelle Pfeiffer and others, but it wasn't [indistinct]. Other countries didn't know about it. We just tried to do what we loved about the show and not have it be reliant on anybody knowing what the show was. - My twist and Tim's twist on the vampire and certainly the base ingredient was Jonathan Fred. He was wonderful in the role and there was no way to escape the sort of beauty that he contributed. - There was no political context? No, political context. You wanna wear a fake nose in you're fucking-- [Narrator] The same year, Johnny Depp and his 21 Jump Street co-stars, Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson briefly reprised their roles in cameo appearances in the series 2012 feature film adaptation. - I mean, look, we know what it's like being an undercover. Metro Police Jump Street division. - Come on, you guys are Jump Street? - Yeah. - Yeah. - That's funny because we were actually Jump Street. - What? - That's crazy. - [Narrator] He also announced the split from his wife, Vanessa Paradis but the pair are close friends. Johnny Depp's next starring role, as Tonto in the Lone Ranger was not well received by the public or the critics. I had a ball. Working with Armie was the gas, the guy, he's very funny. He's very talented. He's a really good guy and we're like a house on fire which I think comes through on screen. - [Interviewer] Absolutely, yeah. What do you think audiences can expect from this take on it 'cause there's a different take on Tonto in particular? - Well, the interesting thing about this particular, let's say incarnation of Lone Ranger is that it's totally different than the first. It's got this sort of the mainstay kind of elements but the majority of the story is very different and puts Tonto in a place where he should have never been in the first place, which is the sidekick. Tonto is no longer the sidekick, he's more of the sort of the lone ranger's spirit leader if you want or spirit walker. - [Narrator] The film was a box office bomb that caused Walt Disney Studios to take a $190 million loss. [upbeat music ] In 2012, Johnny was listed as the highest paid actor in the Guinness book of World Records for earning a total of $75 million in 2011. That great amount of money was earned thanks to his most financially successful films, Pirates of the Caribbean and Alice in Wonderland each grossing $3 billion and $1 billion respectively. In 2015, Johnny took on the lead role in Black Mass, which earned him his third nomination for the best actor SAG Award. It comes everything once you're able to actually see the character and we did five or six tests with my makeup artist to get it to the point where it was just as perfect as we can get. Not only the fact that it aids in bringing that character to life, it was quite interesting to see the reactions from some of his former associates. Some of them were quite freaked out. [Interviewer] Really? There were extras sometimes and they would be in the scene and afterwards, there were a bit freaked out. [interviewer laughs] - [Interviewer] A bit close for comfort. - I think. It was like seeing Whitey Bulger 30 years ago. - [Narrator] He plays James Whitey Bulger, the head of the Winter Hill gang who dealt drugs and ran an extortion racket on the streets of inner city Boston in the '80s and early '90s while simultaneously working as an FBI informant. - It was a conscious decision to sort of combine my approach to the character with Scott Cooper's style of filmmaking. He's really different. This is only his third film. I mean, if you think about it, it's only his third film and the guy, he's just brilliant. I've been a fan of his movies, his other two movies. What's beautiful about him is he has no fear. He's not afraid to take chances, he's not afraid to do a very large sort of a scene in one shot. That sort of bravery is missing. We used to have [indistinct] and people like that who did that. - [Interviewer] Something different in the film industry then. - Yeah, he's got a radical voice, I think and I'm really appreciative of him. Anytime that people take notice of something you've done, although my process hasn't changed at all. My process is the same as it has ever been but of course, it's really nice to hear that people responded to it. - [Narrator] Critics praised his role and said it was exciting to see him back on form. In the same year, he also started alongside Gwyneth Paltrow in Mordecai, an adaptation from the novel series. Johnny played Lord Charlie Mordecai, an art dealer and swindler who races to recover a stolen painting rumored to contain a code that leads to lost gold. The first time I read it, I thought it could never ever be a movie, it's too much. In fact, you realize it's like seven movies in it. You could make at least five movies from [indistinct]. I am Lord Charlie Mordecai, respected by all who know me, slightly. - Excellent shot, sir! - Man down. - I am an art dealer, an officianado. My wife, Joanna, my only true love. - I thought I'd see how you secret agent men run the world. - I'm afraid I shall have to put my foot down, darling. Sorry? - With your permission, of course. - [Narrator] Also in 2015, Johnny married Amber Heard, his co-star from The Rum Diary. This relationship would go on to fall apart very publicly and be the source of grueling court cases. In 2016, Johnny Depp reprised the role of the Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's, Alice Through the Looking Glass, the sequel to Alice in Wonderland. The film had been a huge success which warranted a sequel which did just as well. - It's [indistinct] to be able to get back into that skin, to be able to explore a little bit more about the character [indistinct] other layers, essentially. You see the Hatter at his absolute worst [indistinct]. - [Narrator] Johnny had also been secretly cast to play dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald in a cameo appearance in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in 2016, the first installment of a Fantastic Beasts franchise which is considered a prequel to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. His name was not mentioned in the promotional materials and his cameo was only revealed at the end of the film. In 2017, he also reprised his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the fifth installment of the Pirate series, Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Men Tell No Tales. - In the U. - S, it was less popular with audiences than the previous installments but had a good box office return internationally. Johnny Depp's last film release of 2017 was the Agatha Christie adaptation of Murder On The Orient Express, in which he was part of an ensemble cast. In 2018, Johnny Depp starred in City of Lies as Russell Poole, an LAPD detective who attempts to solve the murders of rappers, Tupac Shakur and the Notorious BIG. - Bet he didn't have Tupac killed. - The facts point to something more here. - If we could prove a connection between cop and Biggie's murder, it will not only break the LAPD... It would ruin the city. - [Narrator] The film was originally set for release in September, 2018 but was pulled from release schedule one month before. It was later screened out of competition at the Noir film festival in Italy but has not been released elsewhere. However, there are now rumors of a 2021 release date. Johnny Depp's last film release of 2018 was Fantastic Beasts, The Crimes of Grindelwald, the sequel to Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them in which he reprised his role as Grindelwald, who becomes one of the main focuses of the plot. Johnny portrayed photographer, W. Eugene Smith in the independent film drama, Minamata which premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in 2020 and was released in early 2021 after being delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. - I've always had a strange fascination with W. Eugene Smith. Initially, the photographs of course but then when I'd read a bit about his life and what he'd gone through, what he experienced, what he sacrificed to capture those moments, to capture those photos. I was also fascinated by the fact that he was known as W. Eugene Smith and I'd heard the story that anywhere he would be, at times curmudgeonly bad mood or whatever it was going on in his mind and they'd say, "What does the W stand for, Eugene," and he'd say, "Wonderful, Wonderful Eugene Smith." Then of course, with the work that he and Eileen did in Minamata is monumental. I mean, it was quite a quite a ride for them, very dangerous, so dedicated. They did not jump ship because between the actor and a camera, there's a strange dance that you do when scenes aren't particularly blocked out exactly to where he doesn't know where I'm gonna go, I don't know where he's gonna go in shots. There's a kind of beauty in the organic nature of that dance between actor and operator or the eye, which has been incredible work. - [Narrator] The film follows Eugene Smith, an American photographer who documented the effects of mercury poisoning on the citizens of Minamata, Kumamoto, Japan. - You start to learn, you start to check and you read about him a little bit. This is years and years ago, then you work with photographers. I worked with Mary Ellen Mark for many years over the years and she had known him at one of the photo... - Probably Magnum. - Magnum. It was Magnum. You find out these great stories. There was a side to him that wouldn't care. He just got, I don't care and he's just moving forward but there was a side of him, he could be quiet. He could bite and he could be rough but the deal with, I think with Eugene Smith, ultimately what I walked away with, especially after talking to other photographers who'd known him and stuff that he was totally unpredictable, multifaceted, quite bitter, quite curmudgeonly and prickly but that was because the heart was in there and it was too close to the surface. It was challenging 'cause you owe a great deal of responsibility to these peoples.

We went to LA to do this record. The whole band was hanging out and that's where you'd meet somebody like him and I'd known him from before and just invited him down the studio. He's a big fan of Joe's and a bunch of other people too. - [Interviewer] He's a great guitar player, isn't he? Is he what? - [Interviewer] He's a good-- He's a great guitar player. - Yeah, you ever seen the movie, Chocolat? [indistinct] - Yeah, well that's really him playing. In the movies, they can fake it and you can tell when you watch him play in that movie, he's playing and that's the real deal. Also, he jammed with us at the Hollywood Bowl in the last gig and the last tour. He wanted to play on Train Kept It Rolling and it's on the DVD and it's on the deluxe version. You can really get a chance to hear him cut loose. - [Narrator] In 2015, he formed the supergroup, Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry. The band also includes Bruce Witkin, his friend from the 1980s band, The Kids. - Well, it started out right here. It started out here. We did Dark Shadows and I was in the movie with them and then one night we were gonna go play the 100 Club. Just my band was gonna go down and just be a bar band, no theatrics, nothing. If somebody yells out Brown Sugar, we'll play it. Back in the USSR, okay. I said, "Johnny, come down and play with us." He comes down, brings his amp and he's a good guitar player, really a good guitar player. He started out being a guitar player, became an actor and then we took it another step. I said, "What if we paid tribute to all of our dead drunk friends, all the guys we used to drink with," and we had a drinking club called the Hollywood Vampires. - [Narrator] The band made their live debut at the Roxy in Los Angeles in September, 2015 and has since done two world tours in 2016 and 2018.
